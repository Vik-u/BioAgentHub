Anthropogenic CO2 emissions are causing ocean acidiﬁcation, which can affect the phy-
siology of marine organisms. Here we assess the possible effects of ocean acidiﬁcation on the
metabolic potential of sponge symbionts, inferred by metagenomic analyses of the micro-
biomes of two sponge species sampled at a shallow volcanic CO
2 seep and a nearby control
reef. When comparing microbial functions between the seep and control sites, the micro-
biome of the spongeStylissa ﬂabelliformis (which is more abundant at the control site) exhibits
at the seep reduced potential for uptake of exogenous carbohydrates and amino acids, and
for degradation of host-derived creatine, creatinine and taurine. The microbiome ofCoelo-
carteria singaporensis (which is more abundant at the seep) exhibits reduced potential for
carbohydrate import at the seep, but greater capacity for archaeal carbonﬁxation via the
3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate pathway, as well as archaeal and bacterial urea
production and ammonia assimilation from arginine and creatine catabolism. Together these
metabolic features might contribute to enhanced tolerance of the sponge symbionts, and
possibly their host, to ocean acidiﬁcation.

early one-third of anthropogenic CO2 has been taken up
by the oceans1, resulting in lower concentrations of car-
bonate ions and higher concentrations of bicarbonate ions
(HCO3−) and protons (H+). Such changes to ocean chemistry
have led to a 0.1 unit reduction in seawater pH since pre-
industrial times2, a phenomenon known as ocean acidiﬁcation
(OA). As atmospheric CO2 levels continue to rise, oceans are
projected to acidify further 2, with signi ﬁcant consequences
expected for sensitive ecosystems such as coral reefs, which
depend on carbonate ions for future reef accretion3. However,
changes in biological and ecological processes resulting from OA
can be difﬁcult to predict, partly because the vast majority of
studies have examined the biological and physiological effects of
OA using short-term experimental exposures. An alternative
approach is to investigate long-term effects of projected OA using
volcanic CO2 seeps which feature naturally reduced seawater
pH4– 6. Research conducted at natural CO2 seeps over the past
decade has revealed substantial changes in the population struc-
ture of a wide range of organisms 4,5. Studies have assessed
impacts on species diversity and abundance4,5,7,8, gene expres-
sion9, as well as functional potential of eukaryotic communities10.
From a microbial perspective, OA has also been shown to modify
the composition of the microbiome in some reef species11– 13.
Microbes play vital roles in the health and survival of all
marine organisms14,15. One of the best understood reef microbial
symbioses is that which occurs between sponges and their asso-
ciated bacteria and archaea. Sponges often host abundant, diverse
and species-speciﬁc microbial communities16, thought to under-
take essential roles in nutrient cycling, vitamin production and
natural product biosynthesis17,18. Shifts in microbial commu-
nities have been detected in sponges collected from a natural CO2
seep at Upa-Upasina within the Milne Bay Province, Papua New
Guinea (PNG). At this location, the shallow reef comprises a
control site with “ambient” pH (median 8.01) representing a
healthy and diverse reef system, and a seep site located 500 m
away, featuring“reduced” pH (median 7.77) caused by the release
of > 99% pure CO
2 gas, which has resulted in signi ﬁcantly
reduced species diversity and habitat complexity5,19. Two sponge
species exhibit drastically different distribution and abundance
patterns at Upa-Upasina. The seep-tolerantCoelocarteria singa-
porensis is 40-times more abundant at the seep, whereas the seep-
sensitive Stylissa ﬂabelliformis is 6-times more abundant at the
control site5. Microbial community analysis revealed variation in
the microbiome of C. singaporensis between sites, whereas the
microbial communities ofS. ﬂabelliformis were largely conserved
across both environments13.
Understanding how the sponge microbiome responds to long-
term environmental change has been recognised as critical for
anticipating the fate of sponge symbioses under predicted climate
scenarios20,21. Yet, whilst changes in microbial community
composition have been found under OA, the impact on the
functional potential of symbiont communities is currently
unknown.
To address this question, we examined the microbiomes ofC.
singaporensis and S. ﬂabelliformis at Upa-Upasina. We speciﬁcally
investigated whether the functional potential of the symbiotic
microbiomes varied between control and seep sites and if these
changes could contribute to maintaining a successful symbiosis in
acidiﬁed oceans.
Here we ﬁnd that the microbiome of the seep-tolerantC. sin-
gaporensis exhibits greater variation in functional potential
between the seep and control sites than the microbiome of the
seep-sensitive S. ﬂabelliformis. At the seep, the S. ﬂabelliformis
microbiome displays an overall loss of functional potential. In
contrast, the microbiome ofC. singaporensis shows an enhanced
potential for energy-ef ﬁcient carbon ﬁxation and nitrogen
metabolism, with a greater capacity to exploit excess inorganic
carbon originating from the seep environment, as well as host-
derived creatine. We hereby identify microbial functions poten-
tially contributing to the success of a sponge species in naturally
acidiﬁed waters.
Results
Microbiome overview . Shotgun metagenome sequencing
revealed that both sponge species harboured microbial commu-
nities that were distinct from each other and the surrounding
seawater (Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary Fig. 1). The
C. singaporensis microbiome was dominated by Proteobacteria,
Chloroﬂexi and Thaumarchaeota whereas the S. ﬂabelliformis
microbiome was largely comprised of Proteobacteria and Thau-
marchaeota. Microbial community composition varied between
the control site and the adjacent CO
2 seep site, with statistically
signiﬁcant differences found at multiple taxonomic levels, parti-
cularly for C. singaporensis (Supplementary Note 1 and Supple-
mentary Fig. 2). The differences in microbial communities
between the two species and the major shift in the composition of
the C. singaporensis microbiome between sites conﬁrmed pre-
vious ﬁndings13. However, the exclusion of Archaea from these
previously published analyses precludes direct comparisons of the
datasets.
Differences between the two species were also found at
the functional level (Supplementary Fig. 3, Supplementary
Tables 1– 2, Supplementary Note 2 and Supplementary Note 3).
Functions that were more abundant at either the control or seep
site, regardless ofp-value, are hereafter termed‘enriched’. Twenty
percent of signiﬁcantly enriched genes (KO annotation) in theC.
singaporensis microbiome were more abundant at the seep, as
were 80% of signiﬁcantly enriched genes in theS. ﬂabelliformis
microbiome (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Table 1). However,
genes that were enriched at the seep were generally an abundant
component of the metagenome ofC. singaporensis but a minor
component of theS. ﬂabelliformis metagenome. The total relative
abundance of seep-enriched genes (COG annotation) was 68
and 19% for C. singaporensis and S. ﬂabelliformis, respectively
(Fig. 1b). In contrast, the total relative abundance of genes
enriched at the control site was 65% and 34%, respectively. A
correlation vector of environmental variables over ordination
of KOs revealed that the functional pro ﬁles were primarily
driven by factors associated with inorganic carbon chemistry
(Supplementary Note 4, Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary
Tables 3– 6).
Transport of carbon and host-derived compounds. One of the
most abundant functions at the seep in the microbiomes of both
sponge species was related to ATP-Binding Cassette (ABC)
transporters (Fig. 1c, Fig. 2, Supplementary Note 5, Supplemen-
tary Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 6). Total organic carbon
(TOC) in seawater was consistent between sites7 (Supplementary
Table 4); however, microbiomes of bothC. singaporensis and S.
ﬂabelliformis exhibited a reduced potential for uptake of carbo-
hydrates at the seep, suggesting that the microbial community
derives less beneﬁt from external energy sources and carbon at
the seep than at the control site22. The C. singaporensis micro-
biome exhibited a reduction in the relative abundance of genes
encoding ABC importers for D-xylose (xylFGH, 4.9-times), ribose
(RbsABC, 2.9-times), polysaccharides (putative transporter,
lplABC, 15-times), alpha-1,4-digalactorunate ( aguEFG, 6.3-
times), arabinosaccharide (araNPQ, 5.2-times), lactose/L-arabi-
nose (lacEFGK, 2-times), rafﬁnose/stachyose (msmEFG, 2-times),
rhamnose (rhaPQST, absent from the seep samples) and Sn-
glycerol-3-phosphate (ugpABCE, 4.3-times), which provides a

source of phosphate in addition to carbon23. In the S. ﬂabelli-
formis microbiome, ABC transporter genes with signi ﬁcantly
reduced relative abundance at the seep were involved in the
import of glucose/mannose (glcEFG, 1.5-times), multiple sugars
(several systems, 1.8-times), Sn-glycerol-3-phosphate (ugpABCE,
2.2-times), trehalose (thuEFG, 2-times) and the osmoprotectant
glycerol (glpPQSTV, 2-times). The S. ﬂabelliformis microbiome
also exhibited reduced capacity for the uptake of several amino
acids and other compounds that could serve as energy sources,
with a lower relative abundance of importers for arginine/orni-
thine ( aotJMPQ, 1.3-times), branched-chain amino acids
(livFGHKM, 1.4-times), general L-amino acids (appJMPQ, 1.5-
times), taurine (tauABC, 1.4-times), spermidine (potABCD, 1.6-
times), and thiamine (thiBPQ, 2.3-times). Other genes related to
transport and which differed between the two species are further
discussed in Supplementary Note 5. The microbial communities
of C. singaporensisand S. ﬂabelliformis at the seep appear to have
a restricted capacity to use exogenous organic compounds for
energy production and biosynthesis, suggesting that sponge hosts,
in particular S. ﬂabelliformis, might retain carbohydrates and
amino acids derived fromﬁlter-feeding and de novo biosynthesis,
rather than providing them to the symbionts.
Carbon ﬁxation and carbonic anhydrase. The concentrations of
bicarbonate ion (HCO3−) at Upa-Upasina were signiﬁcantly higher
at the seep than at the control site (1887 ± s.d 140μmol kg−1 at the
seep vs. 1661 ± s.d 45μmol kg−1 at the control, Supplementary
Table 4). An increased potential for carbonﬁxation via the HP/HB
cycle of Thaumarchaeota was found inC. singaporensisat the CO2
seep, providing support for possible metabolic adaptation of the
microbiome to the seep environment. The 3-hydroxypropionate/4-
hydroxybutyrate (HP/HB) cycle typically uses bicarbonate ion to
produce acetyl-coA and succinyl-coA, which can both be used for
biosynthesis via further conversion into oxaloacetate, pyruvate or
oxaloglutarate-CoA24. A two to four-times increase in the relative
abundance of genes encoding key HP/HB cycle enzymes was found
at the seep, including for malonic semialdehyde reductase (3.9-
times, ANOVA,p =0.03), 3-hydroxypropionyl-coA synthetase (3-
times, ANOVA, p > 0.05), 3-hydroxypropionyl-coA dehydratase
(1.9-times, ANOVA, p > 0.05), 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoA synthetase
(2.8-times, ANOVA, p > 0.05), 4-hydroxybutyryl-CoAdehydratase
(4-times, ANOVA, p > 0.05), 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehy-
drogenase (3.8-times, ANOVA,p <0 . 0 1 ) ( F i g .3a and Supplemen-
tary Fig. 8). These genes were almost all assigned to the
Thaumarchaeota genus Nitrosopumilus (Supplementary Table 7
and Supplementary Note 13), explaining the lack of genes encoding
malonyl-coA reductase, acryloyl-coA reductase, succinyl-coA
reductase and succinate semialdehyde reductase, which are yet to
be identiﬁed from any Thaumarchaeota25. Nitrosopumilus mar-
itimus has been reported to use the most energy-efﬁcient version of
the HP/HB cycle described to date26. These ﬁndings suggest that

the higher HCO3− concentrations at the CO2 seep may favour
energy-efﬁcient autotrophy by Thaumarchaeota in theC. singa-
porensis microbiome.
Another potential marker for adaptation to the high bicarbo-
nate concentrations in C. singaporensis at the seep was the
reduced relative abundance of two genes encoding carbonic
anhydrase (COG0288, 1.5-times and COG0338, 5.2-times,
Supplementary Note 7 and Supplementary Fig. 9), which
catalyses the interconversion between CO2 and HCO3− and were
primarily assigned to Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria and Actino-
bacteria. Such results suggest that the increased bicarbonate
concentration at the seep may reduce the selective pressure on
microorganisms lacking carbonic anhydrase.
Nitrogen metabolism. OA had a large effect on nitrogen cycling
genes in the microbiomes of both species, favouring energy-
efﬁcient biochemical pathways with creatine and urease
degradation in C. singaporensis and causing a decrease in the
capacity to use key nitrogenous compounds inS. ﬂabelliformis
(Fig. 3b, c, Supplementary Note 8, Supplementary Fig. 10 and
Supplementary Fig. 13). Sponges can produce creatine and
creatinine 27, with previous reports suggesting that these
sponge-derived compounds can fuel carbon and nitrogen
metabolism in symbiotic Archaea 28. Both compounds are
interconvertible via creatininase29, for which the encoding gene
did not vary in relative abundance between sites for either
species. However, genes encoding a series of enzymes involved
in creatinine degradation29 were less abundant at the seep site
for both species. In the microbiome of C. singaporensis these
genes encoded (i) cytosine deaminase (1.4-times, ANOVA,p >
0.05), which hydrolyses creatinine into N-methylhydantoin
with the release of a molecule of ammonia, (ii) the two subunits
of N-methylhydantoinase (3.1- times and 3.4-times increase,
ANOVA, both p < 0.01), which uses a molecule of ATP to
hydrolyse N-methylhydantoin into N-carbamoylsarcosine and
(iii) N-carbamoylsarcosine oxidase (absent from all seep sam-
ples), which deaminates N-carbamoylsarcosine into sarcosine
and releases a second molecule of ammonia (Fig. 3b). In
the S. ﬂabelliformis microbiome, the genes encoding N-
methylhydantoinase subunits were also signi ﬁcantly less
abundant at the seep (1.3-time and 1.9-time, respectively,
ANOVA, p < 0.01 for both) (Fig.3b, Supplementary Fig. 13 and
Supplementary Table 11). Simultaneously, C. singaporensis
symbionts displayed a greater potential for creatine degradation
at the seep with a 5-times increase in the relative abundance of
the gene encoding creatinase (ANOVA, p <0 . 0 1 ) , w h i c h p r o -
duces urea and sarcosine, and a non-signi ﬁcant, but 2-times
increase (from 0.02% to 0.04%) in genes encoding all urease
subunits and accessory proteins, which release two molecules of
ammonia and one molecule of CO
2, without using ATP. C.
singaporensis thus might preferentially transfer creatine to its
symbionts over creatinine at the CO 2 seep, supporting our
ﬁndings that energy conservation is an important feature of
successful sponge-microbes symbiosis in an acidiﬁed ocean.

In contrast, the S. ﬂabelliformis microbiome exhibited a
decreased potential for creatine and urea degradation, as well as
glutamine and glutamate biosynthesis at the CO2 seep, a decrease
in genes encoding creatinase (2.4-times, EC 3.5.3.3, ANOVA,p <
0.01), all urease subunits and accessory proteins (1.6-times on
average, ANOVA, p < 0.05 except forureE and ureJ), glutamine
synthetase, which assimilates one molecule each of ammonia,
glutamate and ATP into glutamine (1.3-times, ANOVA,p < 0.01),
and glutamate synthase, which leads to glutamate (1.4-times,
ANOVA, p < 0.01) (Fig.3c). It therefore appears that at the CO2
seep, S. ﬂabelliformis symbionts have reduced capacity to beneﬁt
from host-derived creatine and creatinine fuelling nitrogen
metabolism. While experimental work is still required to conﬁrm
nutrient ﬂuxes, this diminished capacity for nitrogen metabolism
likely contributes to the apparent sensitivity ofS. ﬂabelliformis to
acidiﬁed waters.
The central role of Archaea in the microbiome of C.
singaporensis under OA was further conﬁrmed by interrogating
the taxonomic origin of the genes involved in nitrogen cycling.
Creatine degradation genes were exclusively assigned to bacterial
scaffolds in both species (Supplementary Table 8), except for the
urease subunits in C. singaporensis , which were primarily
archaeal, and the ratio of archaeal to bacterial scaffolds for these
genes increased at the CO2 seep. Accordingly, a greater potential
for urea production by the archaeal community was identiﬁed in
the C. singaporensis microbiome at the seep via agmatine
degradation (Fig. 3b). Speciﬁcally, a signiﬁcantly higher relative
abundance of the agmatinase-encoding gene (1.6-times, EC
3.5.3.11, ANOVA,p = 0.01), responsible for converting agmatine
into urea and putrescine, was found. Whilst this gene was
detected on both bacterial and archaeal scaffolds in C.
singaporensis at the control site, it was more prevalent on
archaeal scaffolds at the seep site (Supplementary Table 8).
Agmatine is produced via arginine decarboxylase, for which we
found two encoding genes:speA (K01585), which was primarily
carried by bacterial scaffolds and was consistent across
sites (ANOVA, p > 0.05), and pdaD (K02626), which was
primarily found on archaeal scaffolds and doubled in relative
abundance at the seep (0.011% to 0.024%, ANOVA,p > 0.05).
Archaeal genes for glutamate-supported arginine biosynthesis
were also detected inC. singaporensisat the seep (Supplementary
Fig. 11, Supplementary Fig. 12, Supplementary Table 9 and
Supplementary Table 10). The ammonia produced as a central
component of the cascade could be used by Archaea for ammonia
oxidation30, as we found at the seep a 3-times increase in the
relative abundance of genes encoding ammonia monooxygenase
(amoABC cluster, ANOVA, p > 0.05), and scaffolds carrying this
gene cluster were primarily assigned to Thaumarchaeota (100% at
the seep and 74% at the control) (Supplementary Table 8). It
could also serve the microbial community ofC. singaporensisfor
assimilation, which is consistent with the signiﬁcant increase in
the gene encoding glutamine synthetase at the seep (1.3-times,
ANOVA, p < 0.01).
Together these results indicate that at the control site ammonia
production via urea is predominantly supported by bacterial-
driven creatinine metabolism, whereas archaeal-driven arginine
metabolism and energy-efﬁcient bacterial-driven creatine catabo-
lism predominates in the C. singaporensis microbiome at the
seep site.
Sulfur metabolism . OA negatively impacted the metabolic
potential for taurine dissimilation and sulfur assimilation inS.
ﬂabelliformis, which may re ﬂect reduced host production of
taurine in acidiﬁed seawater. Indeed, taurine can represent a
considerable proportion of total free amino acids in sponges31
and the microbiome of the seep-sensitive species presented a
signiﬁcant decrease in the relative abundance of genes encoding
three enzymes in the taurine degradation pathway:
32 taurine-
pyruvate aminotransferase (tpa, 2.3-times, ANOVA, p < 0.01),
which degrades taurine into sulfoacetaldehyde and L-alanine,
sulfoacetaldehyde acetyltransferase (xsc, 1.6-times, ANOVA,p <
0.01), which produces sulﬁte and acetate phosphate, andcysI (1.4-
times, ANOVA, p = 0.02), which converts sul ﬁte into sulﬁde
(Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 14). Most of the scaffolds car-
rying tpa had sequence similarity to Thiotrichales and unclassi-
ﬁed Gammaproteobaceria, corroborating the taxonomic results
(Supplementary Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 12 and Supple-
mentary Note 9). Scaffolds carryingxsc were assigned to diverse
taxa, as sulfoacetaldehyde can also result from the decarboxyla-
tion of sulfopyruvate in the sulfolactate degradation pathway. The
bacterial orders Burkholderiales (Betaproteobacteria) and Ocea-
nospirillales (Gammaproteobacteria) represented a lower pro-
portion of the taxa carrying thexsc gene at the seep and therefore
appear to be primarily responsible for the decline in relative gene
abundance of xsc (Supplementary Table 12).
S. ﬂabelliformis microbiomes also exhibited a lower potential
for sulfur assimilation at the seep, as genes composing two
pathways for the conversion of L-homoserine into L-
homocysteine were signiﬁcantly less abundant at the CO2 seep
(Fig. 3c). Three of the four genes encoding these pathways ’
enzymes, namely homoserine O-succinyl-transferase ( metA),
cystathionine-β-lyase (metC) and O-succinyl-homoserine sulfy-
drylase (metZ), were signiﬁcantly less abundant at the seep, with
1.9-times, 1.6-times and 1.5-times changes, respectively
(ANOVA, p < 0.01,p = 0.01 and p < 0.01 respectively) (Fig.3c).
Taxa potentially contributing to these pathways include the
orders Burkholderiales (Betaproteobacteria), Methylococcales
(methanotrophic Gammaproteobacteria), Oceanospirillales (het-
erotrophic Gammaproteobacteria) and Chromatiales (anoxygenic
photosynthetic Gammaproteobacteria) (Supplementary Table 12).
Ocean acidi ﬁcation thus reduces the potential for the S.
ﬂabelliformis microbiome to use taurine to produce sulﬁde and
subsequently assimilate it into biomass. Whether driven by pH-
induced reductions in host taurine production or through a
reduced potential for microbial dissimilation, this reduced
capacity for sulfur metabolism could contribute to the poor
performance of S. ﬂabelliformis in acidiﬁed waters.
Discussion
Our study characterises the potential effects of OA on marine
microbial symbioses. However, metagenomic sequencing has
several limitations that need to be acknowledged. Whilst differ-
ences in the relative abundance of speciﬁc pathways indicate a
shift in functional potential within the microbiome, these path-
ways need to be expressed to effectively alter metabolism. For
example, despite considerable evidence that Thaumarchaeota
oxidise ammonia and emerging research conﬁrming they also
metabolise urea33, it is possible that increased relative abundances
of these pathways within theC. singaporensismicrobiome do not
translate into changes in metabolism. Future studies should
therefore utilise complimentary transcriptomic, proteomic,
metabolomic approaches or stable isotope probing to unequi-
vocally validate altered symbiont metabolism under OA. Simi-
larly, we acknowledge limitations in using results derived from
CO2 seeps for inferring impacts under future acidiﬁed oceans.
Firstly, changes in oceanic carbonate chemistry will occur con-
comitantly with other stressors including ocean warming, pollu-
tion, overﬁshing and habitat destruction, with the potential for
additive, mitigating or synergistic effects34. However, the Upa-
Upasina location is not exposed to anthropogenic pressures such

as pollution or eutrophication and occasional mixing of the water
column during high-wind seasons means that organisms may
experience periods of respite from low pH conditions at the seep5.
Secondly, in addition to changes in functional potential of the
microbiome, other factors such as habitat structure, competition
for space, predation, host metabolism, reproductive success or
larval settlement rates could contribute to the differential abun-
dance of the two sponge species across sites, particularly the
striking 40-times increase inC. singaporensis at the seep. Addi-
tional information on ecological and physiological characteristics
of C. singaporensis is now needed to tease apart the relative
contributions of each of these factors in the success of this species
at the Upa-Upasina seep.
Mindful of these considerations, we nevertheless uncover an
enhanced functional potential for energy-efﬁcient carbon and
nitrogen metabolism in a sponge species that is tolerant of OA
conditions projected for 2100 and show a general loss of func-
tional potential in an OA-sensitive species (Fig.4). Host meta-
bolic adaptation has been detected as a stress response of sponges
under OA
35 and reported as a survival mechanism for inverte-
brate species at CO2 seeps36. However, rapid rates of microbial
evolution, symbiont switching/shufﬂing (i.e., community reorga-
nisation) and vertical transmission of symbionts across genera-
tions can also contribute to microbiome-mediated adaptation37.
Multicellular organisms can maintain homoeostasis under OA by
altering energy allocation for different biological processes38– 40.
Remarkably, a similar compensatory mechanism might also be
occurring at the microbial scale, with the microbiome of OA
tolerant species enriched in energy-efﬁcient pathways that could
enable excess energy to be utilised elsewhere as needed. Given the
key roles that microbes play in host health18, metabolic adapta-
tion of the microbiome could also confer tolerance to future
acidiﬁed oceans.
Methods
Sample collection. Samples were collected in the Milne Bay province of Papua
New Guinea at Upa-Upasina in March 2014 following published methods13 and as
part of Expedition 37. In detail, three biological replicates ofC. singaporensisand S.
ﬂabelliformis were collected on SCUBA at the seep and control sites (500 m apart)
and brought back to the surface in individual plastic bagsﬁlled with seawater from
the collection point. Small tissue samples from each specimen were preserved in
70% ethanol for species identiﬁcation and the remaining tissue was snap-frozen for
microbial enrichment and metagenomic analysis. Twelve litre seawater samples
were also collected in triplicate from the control and seep sites and successively
ﬁltered through 5μm and 0.22μm Sterivexﬁlters, which were subsequently stored
at −20 °C until processing. All samples were transported to the Australian Institute
of Marine Science according to AQIS regulations (permit number 14002493).
Sponge species were identiﬁed on the basis of morphological characters
41 by
taxonomic specialists at Western Australian Museum and conformed to original
descriptions for C. singaporensis42 and S. ﬂabelliformis43.
Sample processing and sequencing. Microbial cells were enriched following
established procedures44 with minor modiﬁcations. In detail, sponge tissue samples
transferred to sterile Falcon tubes (Corning, New York, USA) were rinsed twice in a
shaker set to 200 rotations per minute (rpm) for 5 min in ~10 mL of sterile Calcium/
Magnesium-Free Sea Water (CMFSW) containing 0.4 M NaCl, 10 mM KCl, 7 mM
Na
2SO4 and 0.05 mM NaHCO3 in milliQ (mQ) water. The rinsed tissue was cut into
small (~ 1 cm3) pieces using a 70% ethanol-rinsed and CMFSW-rinsed Tupperware
TurboChef (Orlando, Florida, USA) and homogenised in ~10– 12 mL of CMFSW for
a maximum of 10 min with a SilentCrusher M homogeniser (Heidolph, Schwabach,
Germany). All instruments and equipment used were thoroughly washed with 70%
ethanol and CMFSW between samples. Sterile collagenase (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis,
Missouri, USA) diluted into sterile CMFSW was added to each sample at a con-
centration of 0.5 g L
−1 before incubation at 150 rpm for 30 min. Each sample was
ﬁltered through a 100μm Nylon sterile cell strainer (Corning, New York, USA) and

centrifuged for 15 min at 100 ×g at 4 °C. The supernatant collected into sterile tubes
was centrifuged for 15 min at 300 rpm at 4 °C. The supernatant was again centrifuged
for 15 min at 300 rpm at 4 °C. The newly formed supernatant wasﬁltered twice
through sterile 8μm TETP02500 Isopore membraneﬁlters (Merck, Darmstadt,
Germany) and twice through sterile 5μm TMTP02500 Isopore membraneﬁlters
(Merck, Darmstadt, Germany). The microbial fraction of the samples was pelleted
with a centrifugation at 8000×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The pellet was rinsed in ~5– 10
mL of a sterile buffer containing 10 mM Tris HCl at pH 8 and 0.5 M NaCl, and
centrifuged again at 5000×g for 20 min at 4 °C. This cell wash was repeated twice. A
ﬁnal centrifugation was conducted at 5000 ×g for 20 min at 4 °C. The resulting
concentrated microbial pellet was recovered in 1 mL of sterile Tris-HCl-NaCl at pH 8
and aliquoted into 200μL sterile tubes stored at−20 °C. To minimise carry-over of
potential eukaryotic DNA resulting from possible lysis of eukaryotic cells during the
microbial enrichment process, a DNase treatment was conducted immediately prior
to DNA extraction using DNase I from Epicentre (Illumina, Madison, Wisconsin,
USA), according to the manufacturer’s instructions and followed by DNase I inac-
tivation via incubation at 65 °C for 10 min. DNA was extracted using the UltraClean
kit (MO BIO, San Diego, USA) according to the Manufacturer’s instructions.
Extracted DNA was further puriﬁed using the ZymoResearch (Irvine, California,
USA) puriﬁcation kit (Genome DNA clean and concentrator). DNA from seawater
was extracted directly from Sterivexﬁlters
45 as follows: 2 mL capacity Sterivexﬁlter
bells (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) wereﬁlled with 1.8 mL of a lysis buffer containing
40 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8 and 0.75 M sucrose and sealed, then
incubated with gentle rotation at 37 °C for 45 min. Two-hundred microliters of 2 mg
mL
−1 proteinase K in 10% SDS were added to eachﬁlter bell which was then
incubated with gentle rotation at 55 °C for 1 h. The lysate was recovered in Eppendorf
tubes and received equal volumes of phenol:chloroform:IAA (25:24:1, pH 8.0). The
mixture was centrifuged at 16,000 ×g for 5 min. The top layer was transferred to a
fresh tube and received equal volumes of chloroform:IAA (24:1), before centrifugation
at 16,000 ×g for 5 min. The DNA contained in the supernatant was precipitated in a
fresh tube by adding 0.1 volume sodium acetate 3 M and 0.6 volume 100% iso-
propanol and incubating for 10 min at room temperature. The DNA was pelleted by
centrifugation at 16,000 ×g for 30 min. After removing the supernatant, 1 mL of 70%
ethanol was added. Aﬁnal centrifugation at 16,000 ×g for 15 min was conducted.
Ethanol was removed and left to completely evaporate. The clean DNA was resus-
pended in 20μL of mQ water and left at 4 °C overnight, then stored at−20 °C. DNA
quality and concentrations were checked using Nanodrop and Qubit. Nextera XT
library preparation was performed on all samples at the Ramaciotti Centre for
Genomics (University of New South Wales, Australia) before multiplexing and
sequencing across four lanes of Illumina MiSeq (2 × 250 bp).
Metagenomes assembly. Raw reads were qualityﬁltered with Prinseq
46 to discard
sequences with ambiguous bases or those that were shorter than 30 bp. Reads were
assembled using IDBA-UD with default parameters and the pre-correction
option47. Reads were mapped back to the assembly with Bowtie248 to assess
assembly quality and obtain coverage information. Statistics collected during the
assembly process are provided in Supplementary Table 18. Raw reads were sub-
mitted to the Sequence Read Archive [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra] and can
be found under SRA accession numberSRP159543 (Supplementary Table 19).
Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were binned according to Supplemen-
tary Methods and used to conﬁrm speciﬁc results (Supplementary Note 13 and
Supplementary Table 20).
Taxonomic assignment. Taxonomy was assigned to 16S rRNA subunit genes
extracted from the metagenomic assemblies using GraftM49. Taxonomic resolution
at the species level was not always possible, resulting in some scaffolds only being
assigned to higher ranks. GraftM packages can be found at [https://data.ace.uq.edu.
au/public/graftm/7/].
Functional annotation. Scaffolds were submitted to IMG/MER50 for annotation
along with coverage information to enable the estimation of gene copy numbers.
Scaffolds identiﬁed by IMG to be of Eukaryotic origin were removed. Estimated
copy numbers of Clusters of Orthologous Genes (COGs) and KEGG Orthology
(KO) terms were retrieved from the KEGG database
51 after annotation through the
IMG pipeline using the“standard gene calling methods” protocol from IMG52.
Counts of individual COGs and KEGGs were used for statistical analyses. Analysis
of the COGs and KOs was performed over three stages: (i) for each species, KOs
which were signiﬁcantly different between sites (identiﬁed as described under
“statistical analysis”) were clustered in a heatmap (Fig.1a). The same method was
applied to COGs, which were subsequently grouped into COG categories (Fig.1b).
COGs which were assigned to several categories were not“dereplicated” but left in
all categories assigned; (ii) signiﬁcantly enriched KOs were grouped into KEGG
pathways to identify the thirty most abundant pathways for each species (Fig.1c).
As non-signiﬁcant differences could be biologically meaningful, the average relative
abundance of all KOs belonging to a pathway were summed for each site to assess
the portion of the metagenome represented by these thirty pathways. Pathways with
a total relative abundance over 1% were retained. Detailed analyses presented in
Fig. 2 and Fig.3 were performed on functions previously reported as important for
sponge symbiosis
18,20,53– 55, OA and pH-related functions9,56,57 and functions
identiﬁed as being abundant or greatly affected by site. KEGG orthology lists were
compared to the IMG-derived KO list for each species. Pathways of interest were
manually checked using the MetaCyc database58 and relevant literature (See Sup-
plementary Methods). Taxonomic assignment of scaffolds utilised the IMG data.
Additional results not discussed in the main paper, were obtained following the
same procedure, including results related to eukaryotic-like proteins, (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 7 and Supplementary Note 6), sulfur metabolism (Supplementary Figs. 15–
16, Supplementary Tables 13– 14, and Supplementary Note 10) and vitamin pro-
duction (Supplementary Figs. 17– 18, Supplementary Tables 15– 17 and Supple-
mentary Notes 11– 12).
Statistical analysis of biological data. Rarefaction curves were generated for
taxon and gene datasets to assess differences in coverage between samples and for
quality control. Bray-Curtis similarity matrices were generated for genes (KOs)
using the R package Vegan
59. Variation amongst samples was visualised using
hierarchical clustering, as well as Principal Coordinate Analysis using the“PER-
MANOVA+ for Primer” software package60 (Supplementary Fig. 3). Cluster
analysis conﬁrmed clear separation between seawater and sponge samples and
greater partitioning between control and seep samples for sponges compared to
seawater. A Permutational Multivariate Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) was
performed on the Bray-Curtis matrix of KOs and showed an interaction between
site and species in the partitioning of the samples (p = 0.0237, Supplementary
Table 2), which enabled us to perform a more constrained analysis of microbial
functions in relation to environmental variables (see section hereafter). Given the
focus of this manuscript, no further analyses were performed on the seawater
samples. Gene copy numbers were rareﬁed to the lowest number across samples for
each species to account for differences in sequencing depth. Mean and standard
deviations were calculated on percentage relative abundance of rareﬁed data per
species. Counts of taxa and genes were modelled using negative binomial gen-
eralised linear models with site (control vs. seep) as aﬁxed explanatory covariate
and the total gene copy number as an offset term. Any taxon/gene present in less
than two samples was discarded prior to creating the models. ANOVA was used to
test for signiﬁcance of condition, with p-values adjusted for multiple testing using
the false discovery rate. Adjusted p-values < 0.05 were used to select taxa and genes
that differed in abundance between control and seep environments. Model esti-
mates were generated using an offset= 100, which provided data on a scale
representing relative abundances i.e., estimated mean count per 100 counts. These
procedures were conducted using the R programme
61 [www.R-project.org/] with R
studio62 [https://www.rstudio.com/] and packages Stats63 and CAR64. Data
handling and graphics were produced using the following R packages: tidyr, dplyr,
tibble and ggplot265 [http://tidyr.tidyverse.org], as well as matrixStats66 [https://
cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/matrixStats/index.html] and RColorBrewer67
[https://cran.r-project.org/web.packages/RColorBrewer/index.html].
Statistical analysis of environmental data. The control and seep sites at the Upa-
Upasina location exhibit near-identical temperatures (annual averages of 28.69 °C
± 1.37 and 28.82 °C ± 1.38, respectively) and salinities (annual averages of 35.01
ppt ± 0.63 and 34.77 ppt ± 0.54, respectively). Metrics for the complete suite of
environmental variables and water chemistry recorded from the Upa-Upasina site
are shown in Supplementary Tables 3– 5, along with results from individualt-tests
performed on each of these variables to determine any signiﬁcant difference
between sites.
Microbial functions in relation to environmental variables. To determine the
role of environmental variables in driving the partitioning of samples between sites,
the mean values derived from twenty-one environmental parameters were assessed
against the mean Bray-Curtis matrix of KOs using a canonical analysis of principle
coordinates (CAP). Mean values of KOs, within species and sites, were used for the
analysis to align with environmental data derived at the site level. The CAP
function in PRIMER v7
60 performed distance-based canonical correlation of the
KOs to the environmental data, thereby constraining the ordination according to
variables most signiﬁcantly driving differences between samples (Supplementary
Note 4, Supplementary Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table 6).
