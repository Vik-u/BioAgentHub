Acetate is an economical and environmental-friendly alternative carbon source. Herein, the
potential of harnessing Corynebacterium glutamicum as a host to produce 3-
hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) from acetate was explored. First, the expression level of
malonyl-CoA reductase from Chloroﬂexus aurantiacus was optimized through several
strategies, strain Cgz2/sod-N-C* showed an MCR enzyme activity of 63 nmol/mg/min and
a 3-HP titer of 0.66 g/L inﬂasks. Next, the expression of citrate synthase in Cgz2/sod-N-C*
was weakened to reduce the acetyl-CoA consumption in the TCA cycle, and the resulting
strain Cgz12/sod-N-C* produced 2.39 g/L 3-HP from 9.32 g/L acetate. However, the
subsequent deregulation of the expression of acetyl-CoA carboxylase genes in Cgz12/
sod-N-C* resulted in an increased accumulation of intracellular fatty acids, instead of 3-HP.
Accordingly, cerulenin was used to inhibit fatty acid synthesis in Cgz14/sod-N-C*, and its
3-HP titer was further increased to 4.26 g/L, with a yield of 0.50 g 3-HP/g-acetate. Finally,
the engineered strain accumulated 17.1 g/L 3-HP in a bioreactor without cerulenin
addition, representing the highest titer achieved using acetate as substrate. The results
demonstrated thatCorynebacterium glutamicumis a promising host for 3-HP production
from acetate.

INTRODUCTION
3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is an important chemical raw material. It has been broadly used in
agriculture, food, and materials (Schwarz et al., 2004), which could be attributed to its capability to
produce various chemicals like 1,3-propanediol and acrylic acid (Kumar et al., 2013) and its
signiﬁcant market value. It is worth mentioning that 3-HP has been listed as one of the top high
value-added chemicals for development both in 2004 and 2010 by the U.S. Department of Energy
(Werpy et al., 2004; Bozell and Petersen, 2010). Bioconversion of 3-HP has already been extensively

studied in many organisms, such asEscherichia coli, Klebsiella
pneumoniae, and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Rathnasingh et al.,
2010; Chen et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2019), and a variety of
substrates have been exploited to produce 3-HP (Table 1). So far,
the highest 3-HP titer was achieved inHalomonas bluephagenesis,
which accumulated 154 g/L 3-HP in a 7-L bioreactor using 1,3-
propanediol as substrate (Jiang et al., 2021). Corynebacterium
glutamicum is generally recognized as safe (GRAS) with strong
robustness (Richmond, 1999), which is also endowed with a
broad spectrum of substrates such as xylose, glycerol, and
starch ( Gopinath et al., 2011 ). Meanwhile, it has been
successfully exploited to produce various kinds of valuable
chemicals, like L-glutamate, L-lysine, succinate, and acetoin
with high productivities, some of which have been
industrialized (Becker and Wittmann, 2012; Mao et al., 2017;
Mao et al., 2018; Lu et al., 2020).
Acetic acid, a kind of non-food resource, has attracted much
attention until now. It could be produced both from cheap
chemical synthesis and wasted organic raw materials, which
makes it a green and recyclable substrate. Although acetate is
toxic and unfavorable for many microorganisms as substrate, it
has been exploited to produce various kinds of organic acids such
as succinate (Niu et al., 2018), itaconic acid (Noh et al., 2018), and
3-HP (Lee et al., 2018). It is worth mentioning that acetate could
act as the sole carbon source inC. glutamicum ATCC 13032,
when more than 6-fold of acetyl-CoA would be accumulated
compared to glucose (Wendisch et al., 1997; Wendisch et al.,
2000), which would be advantageous for 3-HP production
through the malonyl-CoA pathway. Currently, only few
research studies have focused on 3-HP production via acetate,
the majority of which usedE. coli as the host.Lee et al. (2018)
modiﬁed an E. coli strain for 3-HP production, and it could
produce 3 g/L 3-HP from 8.98 g/L acetate in shakeﬂasks. A
recombinant E. colistrain produced 7.3 g/L 3-HP with a yield of
0.39 g-3-HP/g-acetate in a 2.5-L bioreactor, using a two-stage
strategy whereby glucose was used for cell growth and acetate for
3-HP formation ( Lama et al., 2021 ). Recently, a whole-cell
biocatalysis method was used for 3-HP production from
acetate by using an engineered E. coli strain LNY07(M*DA),
and 15.8 g/L 3-HP was produced with a yield of 0.71 g-3-HP/
g-acetate (Lai et al., 2021). These studies proved the feasibility of
3-HP production from acetate.
In our previous study, it was demonstrated thatC. glutamicum
is a promising 3-HP producer which produced 3.77 g/L 3-HP
from a mixture of glucose and acetate via the malonyl-CoA
pathway with cerulenin addition (Chang et al., 2020). In this
study, we aimed to enhance the ability of C. glutamicum to
efﬁciently produce 3-HP using acetate as the sole substrate
(Figure 1 ). First, the expression level of malonyl-CoA
reductase (MCR) was optimized to increase its activity and 3-
HP accumulation in strain Cgz2. Second, gradient weakening of
the expression level of citrate synthase (CS) was undertaken to
save more acetyl-CoA for malonyl-CoA formation. Afterward,
deregulation of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) was performed in
order to increase the synthesis of malonyl-CoA. Meanwhile,
metabolomics analysis was conducted to shed light on the
changes of key intracellular metabolites among the engineered
strains. Based on these strategies, the best strain Cgz14/sod-N-C*
accumulated 4.26 g/L 3-HP with a yield of 0.50 g/g-acetate inﬂask
cultivation with cerulenin addition. In fed-batch cultivation, the
strain produced 17.1 g/L 3-HP in a 5-L bioreactor without
addition of cerulenin. As far as we know, this is the highest 3-
HP titer achieved by fed-batch fermentation using acetate as
substrate.

Construction of Plasmids andC.
glutamicum Mutant Strains
The original strain was C. glutamicum ATCC 13032. All the
plasmids and strains used in this study are listed inTable 2. All
primers used in this study are listed inSupplementary Table S1.
E. coliDH5α was used as the host for plasmid construction. All
DNA manipulations including restriction enzyme digestion and
vector isolation were carried out using standard protocols. The
mcr gene encoding MCR (NCBI-protein ID: AAS20429.1) was
synthesized by GENEWIZ (Suzhou, China), and three reported
point mutations (N940V, K1106W, S1114R) were introduced to
increase enzyme activity (Liu et al., 2016). To construct plasmid
pEC-mcr, genemcr was ampliﬁed by PCR, followed by digesting
and ligating to corresponding sites of vector pEC-XK99E.
Plasmids pEC- mcr*, pEC-N-C, pEC-N-C*, and pEC-C*-N
were constructed analogously. To construct plasmid pEC-
mbp-mcr*, gene mcr* was ampliﬁed with a forward primer
containing mbp sequence, after which the resulting fragment
was digested and ligated to corresponding sites of vector pEC-
XK99E. Plasmid pEC-his-mcr* was constructed analogously. To
construct plasmid pEC-sod-N-C*, the promoter and RBS
sequence of gene sod were ampliﬁed from the C. glutamicum

was ampliﬁed from pEC-N-C*. The resulting fragment and the
linear fragment of pEC-XK99E without promoter Ptrc and gene
lacIq were digested and ligated to construct the vector. The
plasmid pEC-H36-N-C* was constructed analogously. To
construct plasmid pEC-sod*-mbp-N-C*, N-C* sequence was
ampliﬁed with a forward primer containing mbp sequence.
The resulting fragment, along with the linear fragment of
pEC-sod-N-C*, was digested and ligated to construct the
vector. All constructs used the RBS sequence
AAAGGAGGACAACC, except for genes placed right behind
P
sod, whose RBS sequences were the same as that of genesod in C.
glutamicum ATCC 13032. Plasmids without promoter
substitution need isopropyl- β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside
(IPTG) to induce expression.
Genome editing ofC. glutamicumwas achieved via a two-step
homologous recombination using suicide plasmid pD-sacB. For
replacing the native promoter ofgltA, the vector pD-sacB-P1-gltA
was constructed as follows: Both the upstream and downstream
sequences of gltA promoter were ampliﬁed by PCR and fused
with promoter P1, followed by digesting and ligating to
corresponding sites of vector pD-sacB. The plasmids pD-sacB-
P5-gltA and pD-sacB-P7-gltA were constructed analogously.
To introduce mutations intofasO sites ofaccBC and accD1, the
vector pD-sacB-fasO(M)-accBC was constructed as follows: the
ﬂanking regions of the fasO site of accBC with relevant
modiﬁcations were ampli ﬁed and fused using PCR, after
which the fused fragment was digested and ligated to
corresponding sites of vector pD-sacB. The plasmid pD-sacB-
fasO(M)-accD1 was constructed analogously.

to an initial OD600 of 0.5. Then 25μg/ml kanamycin and 1 mM
isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 0 h were added
to the medium if needed. And 15μM cerulenin was added to the
medium at 12 h if needed. All fermentations were performed at
30
°C and 220 rpm.
The seed used for fed-batch cultivation was prepared in the
same way, and 200 ml seed cultured in CGIII medium was used to
inoculate CGXII-YB medium (20 g/L yeast extract, 1.4 g/L
sodium acetate, 20 g/L (NH

volume of 2 L in a 5-L bioreactor (Baoxing Bio, Shanghai,
China). Temperature was set at 30°C, and air ﬂow rate was
set at 1 vvm. The initial agitation speed was 300 rpm, which was
set to adjust automatically to maintain dissolved oxygen above
30% of saturation. Pure acetate was added automatically into the
broth to maintain pH at 7.0, and an adequate amount of sodium
acetate was added externally when needed.
Analytical Methods
Cell growth was monitored by measuring the optical density at
600 nm (OD
600). Organic acids were quantiﬁed using a high-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (Agilent
Technologies, CA, United States) equipped with a cation-
exchange column (HPX-87H; BioRad, CA, United States), as
described previously (Mao et al., 2017; Mao et al., 2018). And
5m MH
2SO4 was used as mobile phase at aﬂow rate of 0.4 ml/
min, and temperature of the column was set at 65°C. All data
represent the average values and standard deviations from three
independent replicates.
Enzyme Activity Assays
To extract crude enzyme,C. glutamicumstrains were cultured in
CGXII-YA medium till the exponential growth phase. Procedures
of crude enzyme extraction were followed as previously described
(Lu et al., 2020). Total protein concentrations were determined
using a Bradford assay kit (CWBiotech, Beijing, China).
For measuring the enzyme activity of MCR, the procedures
were followed as previously described (Liu et al., 2013) with
incubation temperature changed to 30
°C. The enzyme activity of
MCR was calculated according to the oxidation rate of NADPH.
For measuring the enzyme activity of CS, the procedures were
followed as previous described (Eikmanns et al., 1994). The
enzyme activity of CS was calculated according to the
formation rate of coenzyme A.
Metabolome Analysis
Procedures for extraction of intracellular metabolites are listed in
the Supplementary Material. Intracellular metabolites were
analyzed using an ultra-performance liquid chromatography
(UPLC) system (Nexera 30A, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan)
coupled with a mass spectrometer (TripleTOF
™ 5600, Applied
Biosystem Sciex, United States) in negative electrospray
ionization (ESI) mode. Most of the metabolites were identiﬁed
with LC equipped with a SeQuant ZIC-HILIC column (100×
2.1 mm, 3.5μm, Merck, Germany). Then 10 mM ammonium
acetate and 100% acetonitrile were used as mobile phases A and B,
respectively, and the ﬂow rate was set at 0.2 ml/min with a
gradient as follows: 0 –3 min, 90% B; 3 –6 min, 90–60% B;
6–25 min, 60–50% B; 25–30 min, 50% B; 30–30.5 min, 50–90%
B; and 30.5–38 min, 90% B. The relative content of metabolites
was normalized to cell density.
Real-Time Quantitative PCR
To extract RNA,C. glutamicumstrains were cultured in CGXII-
YA medium till the exponential growth phase. Procedures of total
RNA extraction and qRT-PCR were followed as previously
described (Zhu et al., 2013). The transcriptional level of 16S
ribosomal RNA of C. glutamicum was used as an internal
reference. Each targeted gene of a strain was measured
three times.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Optimization of the Expression Level of
Malonyl-CoA Reductase
Corynebacterium glutamicum can assimilate acetate as the sole
carbon substrate. More precursor acetyl-CoA would be
supplemented when acetate was utilized, rather than glucose,
which could be beneﬁcial to 3-HP production via malonyl-CoA
pathway. However, C. glutamicum is not a natural 3-
hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) producer due to the lack of the
malonyl-CoA reductase (MCR). Therefore, the mcr* gene
encoding a bifunctional malonyl-CoA reductase mutant
(N940V, K1106W, S1114R) ( Liu et al., 2016 ) from
Chloroﬂexus aurantiacus was inserted into shuttle vector pEC-
XK99E, resulting in pEC-mcr*. Then, several strategies were used
to increase the expression level of MCR ( Figure 2A): the
sequences of mbp-tag and his-tag, which could increase the
expression level of target protein by destabilizing the
secondary structures of mRNA ( Fang et al., 2018 ), were
inserted upstream of the RBS ofmcr*, resulting in expression
plasmids pEC-mbp-mcr* and pEC-his-mcr*, respectively; the
N-terminal half with malonate semialdehyde (MSA) reductase
(MCR-N) activity and the C-terminal half with malonyl-CoA
reductase (MCR-C) activity (Liu et al., 2013) were separately
expressed in different sort orders, yielding plasmids pEC-N-C,
pEC-N-C*, and pEC-C*-N; and stronger promoters P
H36 (Yim
et al., 2013) and Psod were used to express N-terminal and
C-terminal halves, resulting in pEC-H36-N-C* and pEC-sod-
N-C*, respectively. The vector pEC- mcr which contains
unmutated mcr gene was also constructed as control. All
plasmids were separately introduced into Cgz2, generating a
series of strains (Table 2). An optimization of IPTG induction
strength was conducted, and an induction time and
concentration of 0 h and 1 mM were found to be ideal for
MCR expression ( Supplementary Figure S1 ). Both MCR
enzyme activities and 3-HP titers of the constructed strains
were determined.

As is shown inFigure 2A, Cgz2/mcr showed neglectable MCR
activity (2 nmol/mg/min), which explained the undetectable 3-
HP in the medium. MCR activity of Cgz2/mcr* was increased to
33 nmol/mg/min, which was 15.5-fold higher than Cgz2/mcr, and
0.14 g/L 3-HP (Figure 2B) was accumulated by this strain in 48 h.
When mbp-tag and his-tag were introduced, the corresponding
strains Cgz2/mbp-mcr* and Cgz2/his- mcr* both showed an
obvious increase in MCR enzyme activity and 3-HP titer. The
better producer Cgz2/mbp-mcr* accumulated 0.42 g/L 3-HP.
Strain Cgz2/N-C* possessing both mutation and dissection
showed higher catalytic efﬁciency (41 nmol/mg/min), and 3-
HP titer was also increased to 0.22 g/L. It was reported that
C-terminal half was the rate-limiting part (Liu et al., 2016);
therefore, it is reasonable to deduce that placingmcr-C* into
the ﬁrst place of the operon would improve its expression level as
a similar case was reported (Liu et al., 2019). However, an obvious
decline of catalytic activity (9.9 nmol/mg/min) in Cgz2/C*-N was
observed, resulting in the vanishment of 3-HP (Figure 2B). Both
strains Cgz2/sod-N-C* (63 nmol/mg/min) and Cgz2/H36-N-C*
(52 nmol/mg/min) showed much increased MCR enzyme
activity. The best strain Cgz2/sod-N-C* produced 0.66 g/L 3-
HP after 48 h cultivation inﬂasks (Supplementary Figure S2).
Cell growth was not severely retarded when acetate was used as
the sole carbon source, and the biomass of Cgz2/sod-N-C*
reached 23.8 OD
600. The results illustrated the successful
optimization of MCR expression inC. glutamicum.
The mbp-tag and his-tag were shown to improve the enzyme
activity of MCR and the overall 3-HP production under the
control of promoter P
trc. The mRNA secondary structure analysis
showed that the insertion of mbp-tag and his-tag increased the
minimum free energy (MFE) from -36.15 kJ/mol to -27.24 kJ/mol
and -24.8 kJ/mol, respectively (Supplementary Figure S3), which
connoted the effectiveness of mbp-tag and his-tag in destabilizing
the mRNA secondary structure. Moreover, transcriptional levels

of mcr* were also measured by RT-PCR. As shown in
Supplementary Figure S4 , mRNA levels of gene mcr*i n
Cgz2/his-mcr* and Cgz2/mbp- mcr* were slightly increased,
which were 13.0 and 12.4% higher than that of Cgz2/ mcr*,
respectively. However, the enzyme activities of MCR in Cgz2/
his-mcr* and Cgz2/mbp-mcr* were, respectively, 40.2 and 83.4%
higher than the activity of Cgz2/mcr*. The results demonstrated
that the increased enzyme activities of MCR in Cgz2/his-mcr* and
Cgz2/mbp-mcr* were mainly caused by destabilization of mRNA
secondary structure of mcr*, which facilitated the translation
initiation of MCR. Naturally, the better mbp-tag was also
inserted in pEC-sod-N-C* and then introduced into strain
Cgz2, resulting in strain Cgz2/sod-mbp-N-C*. Minimum free
energy of pEC-sod-mbp-N-C* also increased from -30.2 kJ/mol
to -25.25 kJ/mol compared to pEC-sod-N-C* (Supplementary
Figure S5); however, 3-HP production was not boosted as
expected (Supplementary Figure S6). It was presumed that
insertion of tag could only enhance the expression level of
mcr-N, leaving the rate-limitingmcr-C* unaffected, which was
of no help to 3-HP production. Strain Cgz2/mbp-N-C* under the
control of promoter P
trc was also constructed to vindicate our
presumption. As expected, 3-HP titer of Cgz2/mbp-N-C* did not
increase comparing with strain Cgz2/N-C* (data not shown).
Therefore, Cgz2/sod-N-C* was selected for further modiﬁcation.
Knockdown of GenegltA Boosts the
Production of 3-HP
Acetyl-CoA is the indirect key precursor for 3-HP synthesis,
whose availability would extensively affect malonyl-CoA pool
and 3-HP production. It was reported that when glucose was
replaced with acetate as the sole carbon source, acetyl-CoA
concentration in C. glutamicum was increased by about 5-fold,
and the majority of which was depleted through the TCA cycle
(Wendisch et al., 1997; Wendisch et al., 2000). In order to save
more acetyl-CoA for 3-HP synthesis, we tried to reduce theﬂux of
TCA by downregulating the expression of thegltA gene, which
encodes citrate synthase (CS).
Three weak promoters P
1,P 5, and P7 with different strengths
(1, 6, and 13% relative strength of promoter Ptrc, respectively)
were selected from a promoter library constructed in our previous
work (Zhang et al., 2018) and used to replace the native promoter
of gltA, respectively. Then plasmid pEC-sod-N-C* was
introduced into the engineered strains, yielding strains Cgz8/

sod-N-C*, Cgz9/sod-N-C*, and Cgz10/sod-N-C*. The cultivation
results indicated that all the three strains exhibited signiﬁcantly
increased 3-HP titer, and the best producer Cgz8/sod-N-C*
accumulated 1.81 g/L 3-HP, which was 1.74-fold higher than
that of the control strain Cgz2/sod-N-C*, while strains Cgz9/sod-
N-C* and Cgz10/sod-N-C* produced 1.16 g/L and 1.66 g/L 3-HP,
respectively (Figure 3A). Meanwhile, the maximum biomass of
all the three strains decreased to different extents, among which
Cgz8/pEC-sod-N-C* (OD
600 17.85) exhibited the highest
biomass reduction (25.1%) compared with Cgz2/sod-N-C*
(Figure 3B ). No difference in acetate consumption was
observed among the strains, suggesting the acetate transport
and utilization systems were not affected (Figure 3C).
Since P
P1 is the weakest promoter in the library ( Zhang
et al., 2018), the start codon ATG ofgltA was replaced with
GTG and TTG, respectively, to further decrease the expression
level of CS in Cgz8/sod-N-C*, generating strains Cgz11/sod-
N-C* and Cgz12/sod-N-C*. As expected, cell growth of Cgz11/
sod-N-C* slightly declined to 16.65 OD
600,a n d1 . 9 0g / L3 - H P
was detected, which was similar to Cgz8/sod-N-C*
(Figure 3A). The 3-HP titer of Cgz12/sod-N-C* showed a
more distinct increase of 32.04%, reaching 2.39 g/L with a yield
of 0.26 g-3-HP/g-acetate in 48 h (Figure 3A), which were,
respectively, 2.62-fold and 3.06-fold higher than those of strain
Cgz2/sod-N-C*. Accordingly, the maximal biomass of Cgz12/
sod-N-C* was further decreased to an OD
600 of 9.48, which
decreased by 60% compared to Cgz2/sod-N-C* (Figure 3B).
The acetate consumption rate was also negatively affected by
the decreased cell growth, and 0.61 g/L residual acetate was
detected after the fermentation (Figure 3C).
In order to prove that it was the reduction of CS enzyme
activity that escalated 3-HP production, CS enzyme activities of
relevant strains were analyzed. CS activities were sharply
decreased by 90.6, 84.2, and 87.3%, respectively, when
promoters P
1,P 5, and P7 were used. The detected CS activities
were in line with the trends of 3-HP production and cell growth
(Figure 3D). Thereinto, CS enzyme activity of the best producer
Cgz12/sod-N-C* with the start codon TTG forgltA was reduced
to merely 3.62% of the control. The results demonstrated that the
reduced CS activity contributed signi ﬁcantly to 3-HP
accumulation.
Deregulation of the Expression ofacc
Genes Elevated 3-HP Production
Malonyl-CoA is the direct precursor for 3-HP synthesis and is
converted from acetyl-CoA. This reaction was catalyzed by
acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) — a heterodimer comprising
subunits AccBC and AccD1 ( Gande et al., 2007 ). It was
reported that the two subunits were strictly regulated by
transcriptional repressor FasR via binding with the fasO
motifs of accBC and accD1 (Nickel et al., 2010). Since FasR is
also a negative regulator for the genes involving fatty acid
synthesis pathway, which is the dominating competitive
pathway of 3-HP synthesis, we chose to deregulate the
expression of acc genes by eliminating the fasO sequences,
instead of deleting fasR.
The fasO sequences of accBC and accD1 in Cgz2/sod-N-C*
were substituted, as previously reported (Milke et al., 2019),
generating strain Cgz13/sod-N-C*. As shown in Figure 4 ,
strain Cgz13/sod-N-C* produced 1.12 g/L 3-HP in 24 h and
the titer remained about the same (1.19 g/L) in 36 h as a result
of the depletion of acetate in the medium, which was
1.80 times as Cgz2/sod-N-C*. Meanwhile, 3-HP yield also
increased to 0.12 g-3-HP/g-acetate. Noteworthily, 3-HP
productivity was increased from 18.54 mg/L/h to 46.64 mg/
L/h during 0–24 h. Likewise, the acetate assimilation rate of
Cgz13/sod-N-C* reached 0.34 g/L/h, which was increased by
47.8% compared with strain Cgz2/sod-N-C* (0.23 g/L/h). The
cell growth rates of the two strains were similar within 24 h.
However, the ﬁnal OD
600 of strain Cgz13/sod-N-C* in 36 h
was only 18.0, 24% lower than that of strain Cgz2/sod-N-C*. It
was concluded that deregulation of the repression of the acc
genes could efﬁciently redirect more acetyl-CoA toward 3-HP
production.
Combination of the Strategies ofgltA
Knockdown and Deregulation of the
Expression ofacc Genes
Both the knockdown ofgltA and deregulation of the expression of
acc genes were effective in promoting 3-HP production. Hence,
mutations ofacc genes were introduced into strain Cgz12/sod-N-
C*, generating strain Cgz14/sod-N-C*. However, no obvious
differences in ﬁnal 3-HP titer, cell growth, and acetate
consumption rate were observed between the two strains
(Supplementary Figure S7). The transcription levels ofaccBC
and accD1 were then analyzed by RT-PCR to verify the effect ofacc
genes deregulation. As shown inSupplementary Figure S8,t h e
transcription levels of genesaccBC and accD1 in strain Cgz14/sod-
N-C* were, respectively, 2.7 times and 3.0 times as those of strain
Cgz12/sod-N-C*, illustrating the fact that the twoacc genes were
deregulated byfasO mutations.

Chang et al. Enhanced 3-HP Production inCorynebacterium glutamicum
The combination of the two strategies did not promote 3-HP
production further as expected. Considering the enzyme activities
of MCR were similar in Cgz2/sod-N-C* and Cgz12/sod-N-C*, it
could be deduced that supply of acetyl-CoA coordinated well with
the MCR activity in Cgz2/sod-N-C*. However, when CS was
weakened and acetyl-CoA consumption in the TCA cycle was
decreased in strain Cgz12/sod-N-C*, its MCR activity or NADPH
supply became the rate-limiting factor for 3-HP production.
Future endeavors should focus on further optimization of
MCR expression and increase the supply of cofactor NADPH.

Quantiﬁcation of the Intracellular
Metabolites via Metabolomics Analysis
To elucidate the changes of intracellular metabolites behind the
improvement of 3-HP titers and give instructions to future strain
improvement, intracellular metabolites of strains Cgz2/sod-N-
C*, Cgz12/sod-N-C*, Cgz13/sod-N-C*, and Cgz14/sod-N-C*
were extracted and analyzed. When comparing Cgz12/sod-N-
C* with Cgz2/sod-N-C*, it was shown that attenuating CS had a
signiﬁcant inﬂuence on metabolites involving several pathways
(Figure 5A ). Acetyl-CoA, the main substrate for CS, was
increased by 18-fold in Cgz12/sod-N-C* and consequently
increased concentrations of metabolites involving 3-HP
synthesis (53, 411 and 181% higher for malonyl-CoA, MSA
and 3-HP, respectively). This result demonstrated that the
knockdown of gltA directed more acetyl-CoA into the 3-HP
synthesis pathway in Cgz12/sod-N-C*. However, the
signiﬁcantly piled up acetyl-CoA and MSA suggested the
activities of ACC and MCR-N might be the limiting steps for
3-HP production. On the other hand, metabolites in the major
competing route, TCA cycle, were decreased in different degrees
(30, 84, 62, and 39% lower for citrate/isocitrate,α-ketoglutarate,
succinate, and fumarate, respectively). Moreover, intracellular
levels of cofactors NADH and NADPH were also inﬂuenced
by the decreasedﬂux through the TCA cycle as the intracellular
NADH content and NADH/NAD
+ ratio were decreased by 10
and 22%, respectively; meanwhile, the NADPH content and
NADPH/NADP+ ratio were decreased by 59 and 69%,
respectively (Figures 5B,C). The reduced concentrations of
these metabolites were highly correlated with the reduced
maximal cell biomass of Cgz12/sod-N-C*.
The detailed intracellular met abolites in Cgz14/sod-N-C*
were also compared with Cgz12/sod-N-C* to analyze the
metabolic response of deregulating acc genes. As shown in
Figure 5A, the concentrations of metabolites along the 3-HP
synthesis pathway obviously declined (44, 50, 51, and 54%
lower for acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, MSA, and 3-HP,
respectively). On the contrary, the concentrations of the
main fatty acids were much higher in Cgz14/sod-N-C* (270,
463, 560, and 414% higher for dodecanoate, tetradecanoate,
hexadecanoate, and stearate, respectively). This result indicated
more acetyl-CoA was directed into fatty acids, instead of 3-HP
synthesis pathway in Cgz14/sod-N-C*. However, the
phenomenon was not observed in Cgz13/sod-N-C* when
compared with its control strain Cgz2/sod-N-C*
(Figure 5A). Deregulating acc genes in two different hosts
(Cgz2/sod-N-C* and Cgz12/sod-N-C*) led to different
metabolic responses, and the exact reason for which was
undetermined. It was reported that the K
m value for
NADPH of MCR from Chloroﬂexus aurantiacus was 25 μM
(Hugler et al., 2002 ), which was much higher than the
corresponding value (4.5 μM) of fatty acid synthase from C.
glutamicum (Agira et al., 1984). Therefore, it was deduced that
the difference might be caused by the different NADPH and
NADH levels (or NADPH/NADP
+ and NADH/NAD+ ratios)
in the two hosts, and malonyl-CoA might tend to be
metabolized by fatty acid synthesis pathway under a lower
intracellular NADPH level ( Figure 5C ). Moreover,
concentrations of metabolites in TCA were decreased to
different extents in Cgz14/sod-N-C* (19, 75, 17, and 54%
lower for citrate/isocitrate, aconitate, fumarate, and malate,
respectively), which showed that the deregulation of the
expression of acc genes further reduced the amount of
acetyl-CoA metabolized in TCA cycle. The NADPH level in
Cgz14/sod-N-C* was further decreased by 18%, indicating the
NADPH availability in Cgz14/sod-N-C* needs to be improved
to increase 3-HP synthesis.
In view of the fact that the increased supply of malonyl-CoA
in Cgz14/sod-N-C* was mainly directed to fatty acids synthesis,
cerulenin was used to inhibit fatty acid synthesis to explore its
potential in 3-HP production with Cgz12/sod-N-C* as control.
As shown inFigure 5D, the 3-HP titer and yield of Cgz14/sod-
N-C* reached 4.26 g/L and 0.50 g-3-HP/g-acetate, which were
5.4 and 12.2% higher than strain Cgz12/sod-N-C*. The addition

and yield compared to those without cerulenin addition, and 3-
HP productivity was also signiﬁcantly increased from 50 mg/L/h
to 120 mg/L/h during 0–36 h. The results demonstrated that
Cgz14/sod-N-C* is a promising host for 3-HP production from
acetate. However, the high cost of cerulenin renders its
application unsuitable for larg e-scale production. Therefore,
besides further increasing MC R activity, future endeavors
should also be made to inhibit fatty acid synthesis properly,
which can save both malonyl-CoA and NADPH for 3-HP
production.
Fed-Batch Fermentation in a 5 L Bioreactor
To further evaluate the ability of 3-HP production from acetate,
Cgz14/sod-N-C* was cultured in a 5-L bioreactor without
cerulenin addition. As shown in Figure 6,at i t e ro f1 7 . 1 g / L
3-HP was obtained in 120 h with a production rate of 140 mg/L/
FIGURE 6 |Time proﬁles of cell growth (OD600), acetate, and 3-HP
concentrations during the fed-batch culture of recombinant strain Cgz14/sod-

to maintain pH at 7.0; 14 g sodium acetate was added externally at 96,
108, and 120 h.

h and a yield of 0.10 g-3-HP/g-acetate. Cell growth was slow in
the ﬁrst 72 h, after which cells grew faster with a speciﬁcg r o w t h
rate of 0.028 h−1 till 120 h, reaching an OD600 of 132.6. The yield
of 3-HP in bioreactor decreased by 61.5% compared with that of
t h es a m es t r a i ni ns h a k eﬂasks, which might be caused by
increased carbon ﬂow toward cell growth in the bioreactor,
indicating the conditions for fed-batch fermentation could be
further optimized.
Strain Cgz14/sod-N-C* produced 4.26 g/L 3-HP from
8.52 g/L acetate with cerulenin addition in shake ﬂasks, and
17.1 g/L 3-HP using acetate as substrate without addition of
cerulenin in bioreactor, which is the highest titer achieved
using acetate as substrate. The performance of the engineered
C. glutamicum strain proved its potential in 3-HP production
from acetate.
CONCLUSION
This is the ﬁrst report on engineering C. glutamicum to
sufﬁciently assimilate acetate as the sole substrate to produce
3-HP. With optimization of MCR expression and weakening of
CS expression, 3-HP titer of strain Cgz12/sod-N-C* was
increased to 2.39 g/L. With the subsequent deregulation of
ACC and addition of cerulenin, strain Cgz14/sod-N-C*
produced 4.26 g/L 3-HP with a yield of 0.50 g/g-acetate.
Furthermore, Cgz14/sod-N-C* accumulated 17.1 g/L 3-HP
without addition of cerulenin in a 5 L bioreactor. The results
demonstrate that C. glutamicum is a promising host for 3-HP
production from acetate.
