ABSTRACT: The efficient asymmetric catalytic synthesis of
amines containing more than one stereogenic center is a current
challenge. Here, we present a biocatalytic cascade that combines
ene-reductases (EReds) with imine reductases/reductive aminases
(IReds/RedAms) to enable the conversion of α,β-unsaturated
ketones into primary, secondary, and tertiary amines containing
two stereogenic centers in very high chemical purity (up to >99%),
a diastereomeric ratio, and an enantiomeric ratio (up to
>99.8:<0.2). Compared with previously reported strategies, our
strategy could synthesize two, three, or even all four of the possible
stereoisomers of the amine products while precluding the
formation of side-products. Furthermore, ammonium or alkylam-
monium formate buffer could be used as the only additional
reagent since it acted both as an amine donor and as a source of reducing equivalents. This was achieved through the
implementation of an NADP-dependent formate dehydrogenase (FDH) for the in situ recycling of the NADPH coenzyme, thus
leading to increased atom economy for this biocatalytic transformation. Finally, this dual-enzyme ERed/IRed cascade also exhibits a
complementarity with the recently reported EneIRED enzymes for the synthesis of cyclic six-membered ring amines. The ERed/
IRed method yielded trans-1,2 and cis-1,3 substituted cyclohexylamines in high optical purities, whereas the EneIRED method was
reported to yield one cis-1,2 and one trans-1,3 enantiomer. As a proof of concept, when 3-methylcyclohex-2-en-1-one was converted
into secondary and tertiary chiral amines with different amine donors, we could obtain all the four possible stereoisomer products.
This result exemplifies the versatility of this method and its potential for future wider utilization in asymmetric synthesis by
expanding the toolbox of currently available dehydrogenases via enzyme engineering and discovery.

INTRODUCTION
The development of efficient and highly selective catalytic
methods for the synthesis of α-chiral amines in optically pure
form is of great importance for the pharmaceutical industry.
1,2
Therefore, several organometallic-, organo-, and photoredox-
catalysts possessing improved activity and selectivity have been
developed during the past 2 decades for the synthesis of α-
chiral amines starting from prochiral substrates.
3−16
In this
context, biocatalysis has made a tremendous contribution since
an arsenal of enzymes from different families is now available
for the synthesis of α-chiral amines in high optical purity;
17−21
these enzyme families comprise hydrolases,
22−24
ω-trans-
aminases,
25−29
ammonia lyases,
30,31
amine oxidases,
19,32−35
imine reductases/reductive aminases,
36−38
amine dehydro-
genases,
36,39
engineered cytochromes P450,
40−42
and Pictet-
Spenglerases.
43−45
Among these methods, enzymatic reductive amination is of
great interest since it permits synthesizing enantiomerically
pure primary, secondary, and tertiary amines through the
reductive coupling of a prochiral ketone acceptor with an
amine donor. This feature enables access to a wide structural
diversity.
36−39,46−72
As an alternative, the reductive amination
of a non-prochiral substrate, such as an aldehyde, has been
combined with the kinetic resolution of a racemic amine
donor.
73
However, many valuable biologically active compounds
possess multiple stereocenters and, therefore, are more
challenging to synthesize.
2,74,75
In principle, these complex
syntheses can be accomplished by developing enzymatic
cascades.

synthesis of enantiomerically pure or enantioenriched 1,2-
amino alcohols through one-pot cascade reactions combining a
carboligase with a transaminase,
82
an alcohol dehydrogenase
with a transaminase,
83,84
or an alcohol dehydrogenase with an
amine dehydrogenase.
85
An alternative strategy is the trans-
amination of α-hydroxy ketones.
86
The enzymatic stereoselective synthesis of β-alkyl/aryl- or γ-
alkyl/aryl-substituted α-chiral amines containing at least two
stereogenic centers has scarcely been investigated due to
difficulties in finding compatible biocatalysts and the previous
unavailability of reductive aminases and amine dehydro-
genases. These structural motives, found already in some
commercial pharmaceuticals (see Supporting Information,
Figure S2), can be accessed through the asymmetric reduction
of the alkene moiety of an α,β-unsaturated ketone using an
ene-reductase, followed by the reductive amination of the
carbonyl moiety. Ene-reductases (EReds) are flavin-dependent
enzymes that catalyze the asymmetric reduction of activated
alkenes, such as α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, ketones, and esters
(also acids in particular cases), as well as cyano- and nitro-
functionalized alkenes.
87−93
Riva’s group and Bornscheuer’s group independently
reported the combination of EReds with ω-transaminases
(ωTAs) for the synthesis of diastereomerically enriched
amines bearing two stereogenic centers.
94,95
The former
group performed the synthesis of two of the four possible
stereoisomers of 3-methyl-4-phenylbutan-2-amine, 1-(chro-
man-3-yl)ethan-1-amine, and 3-methylcyclohexan-1-amine
(1c) in excellent diastereomeric ratios (d.r. 94:6 to
>99:<1).
94
The latter group focused specifically on the
synthesis of 1c and obtained three of the four stereoisomers
with moderate or high d.r. (86:14 to 98:2) by using two
stereocomplementary EReds with one ωTA.
95,96
In a recent
publication, Paul’s group and Vergne-Vaxelaire’s group jointly
reported the synthesis of α-chiral amines by combining EReds
with native amine dehydrogenases (AmDHs). They obtained
four structures of amine products containing two stereogenic
centers, but only one (or two in one case) of the four possible
stereoisomers was obtained with variable values of d.r. (65:35
to 99:1) and high e.r. (99:1).
97
Notably, due to the inherent catalytic activity of ωTAs or
AmDHs, all the studies mentioned above could give access
only to primary α-chiral amines; furthermore, the possibility of
synthesizing all the four possible stereoisomers remained
elusive. Turner, Parmeggiani, and co-workers reported an
important extension of these synthetic strategies by accom-
plishing the stereoselective synthesis of five-, six-, and seven-
membered ring N-heterocycles containing two stereocenters
(Scheme 1A).

cyclic tertiary chiral amines by combining an ERed with an

imine reductase (IRed). All four stereoisomers of one of the
target amine products, namely 2-(sec-butyl)piperidine, were
obtained in a diastereomerically enriched form (72:28 to
86:14). In another outstanding and recently published work,
Turner’s group reported the synthesis of secondary and tertiary
β-alkyl- and γ-alkyl-substituted α-chiral amines (Scheme 1B).
Most notably, the reaction was catalyzed by a single
oxidoreductase exhibiting both ERed and IRed activities.
This family of enzymes, named EneIREDs, appears to give
access to one of the four possible stereoisomers starting from a
given ketone substrate and an amine donor.
99
Although the
synthesis with a single oxidoreductase possessing dual activity
is of practical convenience, the use of two separated ERed and
IRed still has the advantage of enabling the creation of modular
cascades in which all the stereoisomers of an amine product
are, in principle, accessible by combining enzymes with
different stereoselectivities.
In this work, we developed a biocatalytic cascade for the
asymmetric synthesis of primary, secondary, and tertiary
amines bearing two stereocenters by studying the combination
of EReds with IReds/RedAms with a selected panel of α,β-
unsaturated ketones and amine donors (Scheme 1C). In the
case of the reductive amination of 3-methylcyclohex-2-en-1-
one (1a, Scheme 1C) with different amine donors for the
synthesis of secondary and tertiary amine products, we
obtained all the four possible stereoisomers with an excellent
diastereomeric and enantiomeric ratio. Furthermore, we
introduced the use of an NADP-dependent formate dehydro-
genase for the in situ recycling of the reduced form of the
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate co-factor
(NADPH). This enabled avoiding the addition of glucose as
a sacrificial co-substrate because the ammonium or alkylam-
monium formate buffer was both the source of reducing
equivalents and the amine donor.

buffers (1 M, at various pH and T values) as these are the required reaction environments for the final intended cascade.
Reactions in KPi buffer (50 mM, pH 8, 1 mL) were also performed to enable comparison and data analysis as this is the most applied buffer with

which is thus the so-
called “couple-enzyme approach”. This initial phase of the
work was important because the biocatalytic alkene reduction
using an NADP-dependent FDH for the in situ recycling of
NADPH has not been previously reported. In fact, the widely
applied strategy for NADPH recycling in this biocatalytic
reaction has always been the use of a glucose dehydrogenase
(GDH), which requires the consumption of one equivalent of
glucose as the sacrificial co-substrate.
87−91,93
In contrast, the
use of FDH/formate salt would result in a higher atom
economy (see Supporting Information, Section 3). This is even
more advantageous in the designed multi-enzyme cascade in
which the asymmetric reduction of the alkene moiety is
followed by asymmetric reductive amination, which ultimately
requires ammonium or alkylammonium formate as the only
additional reagent.
We first performed the alkene moiety reduction of 3-
methylcyclohex-2-en-1-one (1a) by testing the whole panel of
NADP-dependent EReds: PETNR,

in KPi buffer.
The two NAD-dependent EReds (NerA and MR) were also
tested for the same reaction in which NAD
+
was recycled using
the wild-type Cb-FDH.
113
OYE2 and YqjM-v1 were the best-
performing EReds in terms of conversion and stereoselectivity
for the formation of (S) and (R)-1b, respectively (Table 1,
entries 1 and 4; Supporting Information, Table S1). The
obtained e.r. values agreed with the previously reported data
using GDH/glucose as a recycling system.
112,114
In a few cases,
the formation of the phenol by-product 1b′ (Supporting
Information, Section 6.1) was observed, and this is due to the
promiscuous disproportionation activity of some EReds on 1a,
as described in the literature.
115
Because the overall cascade
reactions, comprising alkene reduction and carbonyl reductive
amination, must run in a formate buffer of the amine donor, we
tested the alkene reduction using OYE2 and YqjM-v1 in
ammonium formate (HCOONH
4
) or methylammonium
formate buffer (HCOONH
3
CH
3
) at a concentration of 1 M
and a pH of 8.8. The change in the reaction buffer slightly
affected the conversions, which decreased in the case of OYE2
and increased in the case of YqjM-v1. In contrast, variation in
the enantiomeric ratios of (S) and (R)-1b was negligible
(Table 1, entries 2,3 and 5−7). Significant phenol 1b′
formation was observed only for OYE2. In summary, these
results demonstrated that both EReds and Cb-FDH-QRN are
compatible with a formate salt buffer of the amine donor that is
required for the subsequent reductive amination of the
carbonyl moiety.
We conducted the same investigation on the next model
substrate, namely 2-methylcyclohex-2-en-1-one (2a) in KPi
buffer. This substrate is more challenging because the related
saturated product 2b is an α-substituted ketone, which is
therefore prone to racemization due to keto−enol tautomer-
ism.
100
TOYE and XenB turned out to be the best enzymes in
terms of the conversion and enantiomeric ratios at 10 °C
(Table 1, entries 8 and 11; Supporting Information, Table
S10). Notably, the reported values represent an improvement
compared with published data, in which the highest reported
e.r. was 93:7 with this set of EReds.
114,116
Therefore, the
biocatalytic reactions with TOYE and XenB were further
investigated in HCOONH
4
and in HCOONH
3
CH
3
buffers at
the same temperatures (10, 20, and 30 °C) and different pH
values (8 and 8.8; see Supporting Information, Table S11).
The change in the buffer composition resulted in an increased
conversion into the product (R)-2b but a decrease in the e.r.
(see Table 1, entries 9−10, 12−13). In general, (R)-2b was
obtained in higher e.r. when the reaction was conducted at pH
8 rather than pH 8.8 (see Supporting Information, Table S11).
In this work, we also proved that the variation in the ee values
must be (at least mainly) attributed not to an inherent change
in the stereoselectivity of the EReds under different reaction
conditions but to the different rate of the spontaneous
chemical racemization of 2b (for details, see Supporting
Information, Section 7.1 and Table S12). The racemization
rate of 2b depended partly on the temperature and pH, and it
was lower at a lower temperature and neutral pH. However, we
noticed that the type of buffer contributed more than the pH
and temperature to the depletion of the e.e. The depletion of
the enantiomeric excess was also greater in HCOONH
4
than
in HCOONH
3
CH
3
.
In a similar way, we investigated the reduction of 3-
methylcyclopent-2-en-1-one (3a) in KPi buffer. In this case,
PETNR and OYE2 were the best-performing EReds (Table 1,
entries 14 and 17; see Supporting Information, Table S25, for
the full dataset). Switching the buffer to HCOONH
4
or
HCOONH
3
CH
3
did not affect the e.r., while the conversion
was increased by increasing the ERed concentrations (Table 1,
entries 15, 16, 18, 19; Supporting Information, Table S25).
Finally, YqjM-v1 produced the opposite enantiomer in all the
tested buffers with low conversion and moderate e.r. (see
Table 1, entries 20 and 21).
(E)-3-methylpent-3-en-2-one (4a) was the last tested model
of an α,β-unsaturated ketone substrate (see Supporting
Information, Table S31). XenA and YqjM-v1 were the best-
performing EReds for the synthesis of (S)-4b and (R)-4b in
KPi buffer, respectively (Table 1, entries 22 and 25;
Supporting Information, Table S31). The absolute config-
uration of (S)-4b was assigned by measuring the optical
rotation of a sample obtained from a 61 mg−scale reaction
catalyzed by wild-type YqjM (e.r. >97:<3 (S), 78% isolated
yield due to the volatility of 4b) and by comparing with
literature data (see Supporting Information, Section 12.4.1).
117
As in the case of 2b, the obtained (S)-4b is an α-substituted
saturated ketone and, therefore, prone to racemization in
solution. In fact, the same effect observed for the racemization
of (R)-2b was observed for the racemization of (S)-4b.
Therefore, the optimized reaction conditions in HCOONH
4
and HCOONH
3
CH
3
buffers were found again at pH 8 and 10
°C (Table 1, entries 23 and 24; Supporting Information, Table
S31). The saturated ketone 4b was also obtained in
quantitative conversions and in an (R)-configured enantioen-
riched form by using YqjM-v1 (see Table 1, entries 26−28).
Asymmetric Reductive Amination of Saturated
Ketones (1−4b) Using a Panel of Imine Reductases

of known amino acid sequences was tested
for the reductive amination of the saturated ketones 1−4b (for
a description of these enzymes, such as strains of origin, see
Supporting Information, Section 4). Although most of these
experiments were conducted using racemic ketones 1−4b, we
point out that reductive amination will eventually run on
enantiomerically pure or enriched ketones 1−4b in the final
cascades. Therefore, it is more important that the IReds or
AmDHs can install the additional stereogenic center by

reducing the carbonyl moiety with high stereoselectivity than
that they can distinguish the existing chirality of the substrate
at the other carbon atom. We performed the biocatalytic
reductive aminations of the ketone substrates in HCOONH
4
buffer (1 M, pH 8.8) with an aminating enzyme at 30 °C for
24 h. As the 16 IReds were reported to be NADP dependent,
NADP
+
and Cb-FDH-QRN were added again for co-factor
recycling. In the case of the AmDHs, namely Ch1-AmDH, Rh-
PhAmDH, and LE-AmDH-v1, NAD
+
and wild-type Cb-FDH
were added because the three AmDHs prefer NADH as a co-
factor. We initially hypothesized that the reductive amination
of racemic 3-methylcyclohexan-1-one (rac-1b) would have led
to a mixture of diastereomers of 1c because the absolute
configuration at the substrate’s β-carbon atom was supposed to
not strongly influence the stereoselectivity of the hydride
transfer from NADPH to the protonated imine intermediate in
the active site of the enzymes. In contrast, the reaction with
IRED-10, for example, yielded only a couple of cis
enantiomers, namely (1S,3R)-1c and (1R,3S)-1c, with a total
conversion of 94%, the remaining compound being unreacted
rac-1b (see Figure 1A, entry 3, and Supporting Information,
Tables S2 and S44, for the full dataset). This means that IRED-
10 can efficiently aminate both enantiomers of 1b, but the
absolute configuration of the newly created stereogenic center
(α-chiral carbon to the amine moiety) is controlled by the
absolute configuration of the pre-existing stereogenic carbon
atom of ketone substrate 1b. Turner’s group has previously
observed this type of “substrate-controlled” stereoselectivity in
the reductive amination of 2,6-, 2,5-, and 2,4-disubstituted
piperideine catalyzed by IReds.
120
Also, in their case, the
inherent selectivity of the IReds was overridden by the existing
chirality at the methyl-substituted carbon atom. The authors
postulated that the hydride attacks the cyclic imine anti-
periplanar to the methyl substituent to avoid a steric clash.
Accordingly, it appears in our study that substrate 1b binds to
the IRED-10’s active site in such a way that the hydride is also
transferred from NADPH antiperiplanary to the methyl
substituent (Scheme 2). Therefore, the amination of the
enantiomer (R)-1b with IRED-10 proceeded toward the Re-
face of the carbonyl moiety to give (1S,3R)-1c, while the

amination of the (S)-1b proceeded toward the Si-face of the
carbonyl moiety to give (1R,3S)-1c.
This finding was also supported by the reductive amination
of enantiopure (R)-1b catalyzed by IRED-10, which afforded
(1S,3R)-1c as the only stereoisomer in quantitative conversion
(see Figure 1B, entry 12, and Supporting Information, Tables
S3 and S44, for the full dataset). The other enzymes that
performed well in terms of conversion for the amination of rac-
1b were IRED-1, 5, 13, 15, 20, 22, and 25 (conversions 22−
99%). In general, the formation of cis-configured isomers of 1c
was prevalent with most tested IReds, but varied amounts of
trans-1c were also formed (Figure 1A, entries 1 and 3−8; see
also Supporting Information, Table S2, for more data). In fact,
only in three out of 19 cases was an equal ratio between the cis
and trans diastereomers obtained, namely with IRED-5, LE-
AmDH-v1, and IRED-30; the remaining compound was always
unreacted rac-1b (Figure 1A, entries 2 and 9, for the selected
data; see also Supporting Information, Tables S2 and S44, for
the full dataset). The amine dehydrogenase Ch1-AmDH was
the only enzyme that yielded a higher concentration of the
trans enantiomer couple (77:23 d.r.; see Supporting
Information, Table S2, for the full dataset). When we
performed the reductive amination starting from (R)-1b, the
preferentially formed product with the active IReds was the
expected (1S,3R)-1c (d.r. varying from 73:27 to >99.5:<0.5)
(Figure 1B for the selected data; see Supporting Information,
Table S3, for the full dataset). In conclusion, based on the
results from Supporting Information Tables S2 and S3, IRED-
1, 5, 10, 13, 15, 20, 22, and 25 were selected to test the overall
cascade from 1a to 1c stereoisomers, which will be reported in
the next section.
The reductive amination of racemic 2-methylcyclohexan-1-
one (rac-2b) in HCOONH
4
buffer was performed under the
same reaction conditions as for the reductive amination of rac-
1b. IRED-20 and IRED-22 led to quantitative conversion into
2c with a diastereomeric ratio of 82:18 and 68:32, respectively
(see Figure 1C, entries 22 and 23, and Supporting Information,
Table S44). The other IReds that yielded a significant
conversion (22−92%), namely IRED-10, 13, 14, and 15, also
exhibited a non-equal diastereomeric ratio (see Supporting
Information, Table S13, for the full dataset). Although the
rationalization of the stereochemical outcome of the reaction
for the synthesis of 2c is more complicated than for the
synthesis of 1c due to the occurrence of keto−enol
tautomerisms for 2b, as previously discussed, most of the
IReds produced mainly the trans-configured isomers [i.e.,
(1S,2S) and (1R,2R)-2c)], as depicted in Figure 1C (entries
19−23). This indicates that the hydride transfer from NADPH
occurs prevalently syn-periplanar to the methyl substituent for
2-methyl-substituted cyclohexane. However, four IReds
preferentially formed the cis-configured isomers of 2c, of
which IRED-10 yielded the highest conversion (Figure 1C,
entry 18). Only Ch1-AmDH selectively yielded only cis-2c (see
Supporting Information, Table S13, for the full dataset). The
IReds reported in Figure 1C were selected to test the overall
cascade from 2a to 2c stereoisomers.
Racemic 3-methylcyclopentan-1-one (rac-3b) turned out to
be a challenging substrate for the reductive amination with
ammonia as an amine donor since it was converted only by
IRED-20 and 22 (Figure 1D, entries 24 and 25; see Supporting
Information, Tables S26 and S44, for the full dataset).
Therefore, these two IReds were selected to test the overall
cascade from 3a to 3c stereoisomers. In contrast, 15 out of 16
IReds could aminate rac-3b when methylamine was used as the
amine donor. This interesting finding is described in detail in
the next section.
Racemic (E)-3-methylpent-3-en-2-one (rac-4b) was also
aminated only by an amine dehydrogenase (Ch1-AmDH) and
an imine reductase (IRED-20) when we used ammonia as an
amine donor. Ch1-AmDH produced an equal mixture of 4c
diastereomers and IRED-20 afforded 68:32 d.r., while the
remaining compound was always unreacted 4b (Figure 1E,
entries 26 and 27; see Supporting Information, Tables S32 and
S44, for the full dataset). Therefore, these two enzymes were
selected to test the overall cascade from 4a to 4c stereo-
isomers. Like rac-3b, rac-4b was better accepted by the IReds
when methylamine was used as an amine donor (eight out of
16 enzymes) instead of ammonia. The analysis of these results
is reported in the next section.
Asymmetric Reductive Amination of Saturated
Ketones (1−4b) Using a Panel of Imine Reductases
(IReds) to Give Secondary Amines (1−4d). The same
panel of IReds and LE-AmDH-v1 was tested for the reductive
amination of rac-1b with methylamine as an amine donor. The
amine donor was again supplied as a component of the
reaction buffer HCOONH
3
CH
3
(1 M, pH 8.8). As observed
for the reaction with ammonia as an amine donor, the absolute
configuration of the β-carbon of 1b influenced the stereo-
selectivity of the reductive amination. In particular, IRED-5,
11, 13, 15, 20, 22, 25, and 30 yielded quantitative conversion
with variable ratios of cis/trans diastereomers. The formation
of cis-1d prevailed over the formation of trans-1d in 14 out of
17 cases (Figure 2A, entries 1−9; see Supporting Information,
Tables S4 and S45, for the full dataset). When we conducted
the same reaction starting from (R)-1b, quantitative con-
version was observed with most of the IReds (Figure 2B,
entries 10−19; see Supporting Information, Tables S5 and
S45, for the full dataset). However, only IRED-10 and IRED-
11 yielded (1S,3R)-1d in high optical purity (98:2 d.r. or
>99:<1 d.r; entries 11 and 12). The assignment of the absolute
configuration of the enantiomers of 1d was accomplished by
following a strategy that was developed in this work and is
described in the Supporting Information, Section 12.1.2 and
Figure S5.
Based on the results from Supporting Information Tables S4
and S5, IRED-5, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 20, 22, 30, and AspRedAm
were selected to test the overall cascade from 1a to 1d
stereoisomers.

>99% conversion, while IRED-15 yielded 98% conversion
(Figure 2C, entries 25−28). In all these cases, the trans-
isomers (1R,2R, and 1S,2S) were prevalently formed, as
previously observed for the amination of rac-2b with ammonia
as an amine donor. IRED-5, 10, 11, 13, 14, and AspRedAm
also yielded significant conversions (40−97%) (see Figure 2C

and Supporting Information, Tables S14 and S45, for the full
dataset). Notably, IRED-13 and 14 favored the formation of
cis-2d, in contrast to all the other IReds (see Figure 2C, entries
23 and 24, and Supporting Information, Table S14, for a
complete analysis). All the IReds depicted in Figure 2C were
selected to test the overall cascade from 2a to 2d stereo-
isomers.
As briefly anticipated in the previous section, the reductive
amination of rac-3b in HCOONH
3
CH
3
was successful with
most of the tested IReds, in contrast to the amination with
ammonia as an amine donor. IRED-11, 15, 20, and 22 yielded
quantitative conversion (Figure 2D, entries 32, 35, 36, and 37).
IRED-5, 10, 13, 14, 30, and AspRedAm also yielded significant
conversion (44−98%; see Figure 2D and Supporting
Information, Tables S27 and S45, for the full dataset).
Therefore, all these IReds were selected to test the overall
cascade from 3a to 3d stereoisomers.
As anticipated in the previous section, the reductive
amination of rac-4b in HCOONH
3
CH
3
was also more
successful than in HCOONH
4
buffer. We observed conversion
with eight IReds (4−51%), namely IRED-5, 13, 14, 15, 20, 22,
30, and 32, with again a non-equal diastereomeric ratio in all
the cases (see Figure 2E and Supporting Information, Tables
S33 and S45, for the full dataset). IRED-20 yielded the highest
conversion (Figure 2E, entry 44). Either one of the two
enantiomeric couples of 4d was prevalently obtained depend-
ing on the IRed used. All the IReds except IRED-15 depicted
in Figure 2E were selected to test the overall cascade from 4a
to 4d stereoisomers.
Biocatalytic Cascade Combining EReds and IReds for
the Conversion of α,β-Unsaturated Ketones (1−4a) into
Chiral Primary Amines (1−4c) Containing Two Stereo-
genic Centers. The cascade reaction from 1a to give 1c in
high optical purity was first tested by combining OYE2, as one
of the best-performing EReds for alkene moiety reduction
(Table 1, entry 2), with the selected best-performing IReds for
reductive amination (Figure 1A,B). We performed this one-pot
concurrent cascade in the HCOONH
4
buffer (1 M, pH 8.8)
with 1a at 30 °C for 24 h. The best combinations in terms of
conversion and stereoselective outcome of the reaction were
OYE2 with either IRED-10 or 22. Both combinations yielded
(1R,3S)-1c in excellent conversions and stereoselectivities
(Table 2, entries 1 and 2). For the full dataset with a detailed
composition of the reaction mixtures, see Supporting
Information, Tables S6 and S7. Notably, (1R,3S)-1c could
previously be obtained at a maximum of 94:6 d.r. or 95:5 d.r. in
two independently conducted studies using the more complex
ω-transaminase-based amination system.
94,95
Furthermore, the
(1R,3S) stereoisomer of 1c has not previously been obtained
with any other cascade using dehydrogenase enzymes.
97
Even
the recently discovered EneIREDs were reported to produce a
trans-configured stereoisomer (i.e., 1R,3R) for the reactions
starting from 3-substituted cyclohexanone as substrates similar
to 1a.
99
Therefore, the combinations of OYE2 with either
IRED-10 or -22 are currently the only ones that can deliver
(1R,3S)-1c (a cis-isomer) in excellent optical purity.
Because the ene-reductase YqjM-v1 has the opposite
stereoselectivity from that of OYE2 in the reduction of 1a to
1b (Table 1, entry 5), we investigated the cascades combining
YqjM-v1 with the best-performing IReds for the reductive
amination at 20 °C. The best combinations were YqjM-v1
combined with IRED-10, 13, 15, or 25 (Table 2, entries 3−6),
thus leading to the quantitative conversion of (1S,3R)-1c (the
other cis-isomer) with excellent d.r. and e.r. For the full dataset
with a detailed composition of the reaction mixtures, see
Supporting Information, Tables S6 and S7. (1S,3R)-1c is
currently unattainable by combining EReds with ωTAs due to
the lack of an ωTA possessing suitable stereoselectivity toward

the saturated ketone intermediate.
94−96
In a concomitant work,
(1S,3R)-1c could be produced only at a maximum of 49%
conversion using a native AmDH.
97
In general, the scope of
the ERed/IRed cascade for the conversion of 1a to give access
to both cis-isomers of 1c in excellent d.r. and e.r. complements
very well the documented trans-selectivity of the recently
discovered EneIRED for 3-substituted cyclohexenones.
99
The cascade for the conversion of 2a into optically active 2c
turned out to be more challenging due to the previously
described in situ racemization of the optically active
intermediate 2b, which can be minimized by reducing the
temperature to 10 °C and changing the HCOONH
4
buffer
conditions (200 mM, pH 8; see Supporting Information,
Tables S10 and S11, for details). As previously reported, the
reduced temperature and buffer concentration led to a
significant decrease in the catalytic activity of all the tested
IReds (IRED-10, 13, 14, 15, 20, 22, and 25) in the cascade
reaction with TOYE (see Supporting Information, Tables S15
and S16, for details). This resulted in a maximum of 32% total
conversion with the trans-configured isomer (1R,2R)-2c as the
major stereoisomer. Notably, the previously reported EneIRED
enzymes favored the formation of a cis-isomer (i.e., (1S,2R)) in
the case of the tested 2-substituted cyclohexenone substrate,
thus again highlighting the complementarity of our ERed/IRed
cascade approach in terms of stereoselectivity.
99
However,
aiming at improving the conversion, we decided to test the
reaction from 2a to 2c in a one-pot two-stage cascade (i.e., a
one-pot two-step separated in time). In the first stage of the
one-pot cascade, TOYE, Cb-FDH-QRN, NADP
+
, HCOONa,
and substrate 2a were incubated in KPi buffer (1 mL, pH 7, 50
mM) at 10 °C for 24 h. In the next stage, HCOONH
4
buffer
(1 mL, 1 M, pH 7) containing IRed, Cb-FDH-QRN, and
NADP
+
was added directly to the previous solution and
incubated at 20 °C for 24 h. The best combination in terms of
conversion and stereoselectivities was TOYE with IRED-22
(Table 2, entry 7). For the full dataset with detailed
procedures, see Supporting Information, Tables S17−S20.
For the cascade reaction from 3a to 3c, OYE2, rather than
PETNR, was selected since the former ene-reductase yielded a
higher conversion (see Table 1). The reaction was performed
in a one-pot concurrent two-step mode; thus, the alkene
reduction and reductive amination run simultaneously in this
case. The combination of OYE2 with each of the IReds in
HCOONH
4
buffer (1 mL, 1 M, pH 8) led to measurable
conversions only in two cases, namely OYE2 and IRED-20 or
OYE2 and IRED-22 (Table 2, entry 8; Supporting
Information, Table S28). All our efforts to analytically separate
all the four possible stereoisomers of 3c were unsuccessful.
However, we could separate the two couples of enantiomers
from each other, thus determining a d.r. of 95:5. We could
then infer an e.r. value of >99:<1 based on the single alkene
reduction step catalyzed by OYE2 (Table 1). The absolute
configuration at the C-3 atom of 3c was (S) according to the
stereoselectivity of OYE2, while the configuration at the C-1
atom was assigned as (R) based on the determination of the
stereoselectivity of IRED-22 in the cascade reaction with 3a
and methylamine (see the next section).
The last cascade from 4a to 4c again involved an α-
substituted, α-chiral ketone intermediate (4b). Therefore, to
minimize any possible in situ racemization of the 4b

intermediate along the cascade, we applied the one-pot
sequential two-step approach. Thus, the alkene reduction was
conducted at pH 7.1 in KPi buffer (50 mM, 1 mL) at 20 °C for
24 h. The lower temperature and the neutral pH precluded
keto−enol tautomerization, thereby preserving the generated
enantiomeric ratio in this step. XenA was used as the best
ERed combined with Cb-FDH-QRN, NADP
+
, and HCOONa.
To the same pot, HCOONH

buffer (1 M, pH 8.4, 1 mL), an
aminating enzyme, a co-factor (either NADP
+
for IRED-20 or
NAD
+
for Ch1-AmDH), and a co-factor-recycling enzyme
(either Cb-FDH-QRN for NADPH recycling or Cb-FDH for
NADH recycling) were added, and the reaction was run for
further 23 h. The full dataset and procedures are reported in
Supporting Information, Tables S34 and S35. Notably, an
increase in temperature from 30 to 50 °C was beneficial for the
reaction with the thermostable Ch1-AmDH. In summary,
starting from 4a, both (2R,3S)-4c and (2S,3S)-4c were
obtained with good to excellent conversion and stereo-
selectivity (Table 2, entries 9 and 10). Notably, the syntheses
of (2R,3S)-4c and (2S,3S)-4c have never been achieved
previously using either cascades with ωTAs or native AmDHs,
or with EneIREDs.
47,94−97
Finally, a semi-preparative scale synthesis of (1R,3S)-1c was
accomplished from 1a (30 mg) by combining OYE2 with
IRED-22. The final product was obtained in 96% conversion,
70% yield, and high optical purity (99.5:0.5 e.r., 97:3 d.r.;

Biocatalytic Cascade Combining EReds and IReds for
the Conversion of α,β-Unsaturated Ketones (1−4a) into
Chiral Secondary (i.e., N-Methyl) Amines (1−4d)
Containing Two Stereogenic Centers. The synthesis of
secondary amines starting from α,β-unsaturated ketones is not
possible using EReds combined with either ωTA or AmDH as
these enzymes can produce only primary amines.
25−29,36,37,39
The formation of N-methyl secondary amines with an AmDH
was documented in one of our publications, albeit with
imperfect chemo- and stereo-selectivity and a constrained
substrate scope.
121
In contrast, IReds can effectively give access
to secondary and even tertiary amines by reductive amination
of ketones,
36−39,46−56
a feature that we decided to explore in
this work for the synthesis of secondary amines possessing two
stereogenic centers. For this purpose, we first investigated the
cascade reaction from 1a to yield optically active 1d by
combining either OYE2 or YqjM-v1�as the best-performing
EReds possessing opposite stereoselectivity for the reduction
of 1a to 1b (Table 1, entries 1−7)�with each of the best-
performing IReds for the reductive amination of ketone 1b
with methylamine as an amine donor (Figure 2A,B). The one-
pot concurrent cascade was conducted in the HCOONH
3
CH
3
buffer (1 M, pH 8.8) under the same conditions as described
for the cascade from 1a to 1c in HCOONH
4
buffer. Notably,
(1R,3S)-1d was obtained in quantitative conversion and
excellent stereoselectivity by combining OYE2 with AspRe-
dAm as IRed (Table 3, entry 1). The combination of OYE2
with IRED-11 yielded the same product with a slightly lower
conversion and d.r., albeit with the same e.r. (Table 3, entry 2).
The other enantiomer product (1S,3R)-1d was also obtained
in quantitative conversion and elevated stereoselectivity
through the combination of YqjM-v1 with IRED-10 (Table
3, entry 3). The combination of YqjM-v1 with IRED-11
yielded the product with the same absolute configuration,
again in quantitative yield, but a slightly lower d.r. and e.r.
(Table 3, entry 4). For the full dataset, see Supporting
Information, Tables S8 and S9. Notably, our ERed/IRed
cascades afforded the synthesis of the two cis-configured
stereoisomers of 1d in excellent optical purity, which have not
previously been synthesized. This result again highlights the
complementarity between the ERed/IRed cascade and the
reaction catalyzed by EneIRED, as the latter strategy always
gives access to a trans-stereoisomer product (i.e., 1R,3R) in the
conversion of 1,3-alkyl-substituted cyclohexenones to yield the
related secondary amines.
99
Based on the previously discussed results for the conversion
of 2a into 2c, we again performed the biocatalytic cascade from
2a to 2d in a one-pot sequential two-step mode. The
combination of TOYE with several IReds, namely IRED-5,
11, 20, 30, and AspRedAm, produced quantitative conversion
giving (1R,2R)-2d as the main stereoisomer in excellent d.r.
and e.r. (Table 3, entries 5−9). For the full dataset with
detailed procedures, see Supporting Information, Tables S21−
S24. A complementarity in the observed absolute configuration
of the obtained product was again observed between the
ERed/IRed cascade and the EneIRED enzyme. Our cascade
yielded one trans-configured stereoisomer (i.e., (1R,2R)-2d),
while EneIRED was reported in one case to yield a cis-
configured 1,2 methyl-substituted secondary amine (i.e., the
(1S,2R) configuration).
99
As methylamine was generally better accepted than
ammonia as an amine donor for the reductive amination of
rac-3b with the IReds, the cascade from 3a to 3d with OYE2
led to successful conversions with more aminating enzymes,
namely IRED-5, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 20, 22, 30, and AspRedAm
(see Supporting Information, Table S29). In particular, the
one-pot concurrent two-step reaction using OYE2 combined
with IRED-20 led to the quantitative conversion of 3d within
24 h. One major stereoisomer was detected with 99:1 d.r.,
while the e.r. was inferred to be >99:<1 from the previous
alkene reduction step (Table 3, entry 10). Notably, the
opposite diastereomer was obtained in 56% conversion and
excellent stereoselectivity by combining OYE2 with IRED-15
(Table 3, entry 11). This latter conversion became quantitative
by applying a one-pot two-step sequential protocol and
increasing the concentration of IRED-15 (Table 3, entry 12;
for details see Supporting Information, Table S30). In
summary, the two cascades with OYE2 and IRED-20 or with
OYE2 and IRED-15 led to two diastereomers with the same
absolute configuration at the C-3 atom (S) and the opposite
configuration at the C-1 atom. The absolute configuration of
this latter carbon atom was determined by NOESY
1
H NMR
spectroscopic studies (see Supporting Information, Section
12.3.3, for an extended explanation), concluding that OYE2/
IRED-20 and OYE2/IRED-15 led to (1R,3S)-3d (cis) and
(1S,3S)-3d (trans), respectively.
The last cascade from 4a to 4d was performed following the
one-pot sequential two-step approach to again minimize any
possible in situ racemization of the α-substituted, α-chiral
ketone intermediate 4b. Although the control experiment for
the reduction of the alkene moiety of 4a catalyzed by XenA led
to 4b in 96:4 e.r., the overall cascade from 4a to 4d gave the
final product with 89:11 e.r.; this signifies that partial
racemization at the C-α to the carbonyl moiety occurred
during reductive amination (for details, see Supporting
Information, Table S36). Therefore, we investigated the single
reduction of the alkene moiety catalyzed by XenA at pH 7 in
either KPi or HCOOCH

buffer. The results showed that
neither conversion nor stereoselectivity of the alkene reduction

was influenced by a lower pH or a different buffer (for details,
see Supporting Information, Table S37). The influence of the
temperature was also negligible (see Supporting Information,
Table S40). Several experiments with buffers at different pH
values, varying the enzyme concentrations and testing both the
concurrent and the sequential one-pot two-step approaches
(see Supporting Information, Tables S38 and 39), led to the
optimized conditions for this cascade. It was finally performed

was converted into (2S,3S)-4d in 47% conversion and
excellent stereoselectivity (Table 3, entry 13).
Finally, in the context of NOESY experiments, semi-
preparative scale syntheses of (1R,3S)-3d and (1S,3S)-3d
were accomplished from 3a (53−54 mg) by combining OYE2
with IRED-20 and 15, respectively. (1R,3S)-3d was obtained in
98% conversion, 99:1 d.r, and >99:<1 e.r., whereas (1S,3S)-3d
was obtained in >99% conversion, 95:5 d.r., and >99:<1 e.r.
Biocatalytic Cascade Combining EReds and IReds
and Using Other Amine Donors for the Conversion of
α,β-Unsaturated Ketones into Chiral Secondary and
Tertiary Amines Containing Two Stereogenic Centers.
Finally, we explored the synthetic potential of this one-pot
cascade by testing ERed and IRed for the syntheses of chiral
secondary and tertiary amines by using other amine donors,
such as pyrrolidine (d3), cyclopropanamine (d4), allylamine
(d5), and propargylamine (d6). All the four α,β-unsaturated
ketones (1−4a) were tested as possible substrates for this
cascade, and the reactions were performed following the one-
pot sequential two-step approach. Therefore, the asymmetric
reduction of the alkene moiety of substrates 1−4a was
conducted using the best-performing enzymes, as reported in
Table 1, in KPi buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5, 1 mL) at 30 °C for 24
h. OYE2 and YqjM-v1 were used for the reactions with 1a,
whereas TOYE, OYE2, and XenA were used for the reactions
with 2a, 3a, and 4a, respectively. All these reactions yielded the
respective products 1−4b with conversions and enantiomeric
excesses, as reported in Table 4. The reaction mixtures from
the first step were directly used for the subsequent reductive
amination step by directly adding a buffer solution containing
each of the four amine donors (d3−6, 100 mM, pH 8.5−9.5, 1
mL) and each of the IReds from this study. The buffer with the

amine donor and the IReds also contained NADP
+
, Cb-FDH-
QRN, and HCOONa. In general, the final molar ratio between
the substrate and the amine donor was 1 to 10. This ratio
between the carbonyl compound acceptor and the amine
donor is in the range of the catalytic activity reported for
reductive aminase enzymes (see Supporting Information,
Section 10, for details).
46
Among the tested combinations, only the cascades starting
from 1a yielded the desired final amine products (Figure 3).
Notably, we observed a typical trend regarding the acceptance
of the intermediates (R)-1b or (S)-1b by the IReds. Regardless
of the structure of the amine donor d3−6, (R)-1b was
preferentially accepted by IRED-10, 20, and 30. Additionally,
IRED-5 catalyzed the synthesis of 1-((3R)-3-
methylcyclohexyl)pyrrolidine diastereomers (1e) with higher
conversion, albeit with lower d.r. than IRED-30. In contrast,
(S)-1b was preferentially accepted by IRED-15 and AspRe-
dAm. The only exception was the synthesis of 1-((3S)-3-
methylcyclohexyl)pyrrolidine diastereomers (1e), for which
IRED-14 and 32 were the best-performing aminating enzymes.
Considering the data for the reduction from 1a to give (R)- or
(S)-1b catalyzed by ERed and the data for the reductive
amination catalyzed by IRed to give the final products 1e−h,
we observed that all the four possible stereoisomers were
obtained in perfect or highly enriched optical purity in most of
the cases. This fact exemplifies the stereochemical synthetic
versatility of the dual-enzyme (ERed−IRed) approach because
stereogenic centers with all of the different absolute
configurations could be installed. This result has not previously
been obtained for the synthesis of chiral amines bearing two
stereogenic centers. For instance, the recently discovered
EneIReds generally yield one of the trans-configured products
starting from substrates such as 1a.

Information Table S43 report the selected data and the full
dataset for these one-pot sequential two-step cascades. Finally,

CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we have presented an enzymatic cascade that
combined EReds with IReds/RedAms for the conversion of
α,β-unsaturated ketones into primary, secondary, and tertiary
amines containing two stereogenic centers in very high
chemical purity, diastereomeric ratios, and enantiomeric ratios.
It is noteworthy that the chemoselectivity of the reactions was
also excellent when the cascades were run in a concurrent
mode because the possible amino-alkene by-product was never
observed. Compared with previously reported strategies, our
strategy could access, in many cases, more or even all of the
possible stereoisomers of the amine products while also
avoiding the relevant formation of any side-product.
98
This was
possible due to the large pool of tested EReds and IReds and
the thorough testing and optimization of the reaction
conditions. Incidentally, the cascade reaction was also
performed at a 30 mg scale for the synthesis of (1R,3S)-1c
from 1a (70% overall yield) and at a >50 mg scale for the
synthesis of (1S,3S)-3d and (1R,3S)-3d from 3a (98 to >99%
conversion). Another important aspect was the utilization, for
the first time in such reactions, of an NADP-dependent FDH
for the in situ recycling of the NADPH co-factor. The FDH
enables the atom efficiency of the reaction to be improved
since the ammonium or alkylammonium buffer is also the
source of the amine donor and reducing equivalents.
Furthermore, FDH was found to be very stable under the
required reaction conditions (e.g., high concentrations of
ammonium or alkylammonium species and a wide range of pH
values), which is not generally the case for the reported glucose
dehydrogenases.
97
Notably, our dual-enzyme ERed/IRed strategy exhibits a
complementarity with the recently reported EneIRED enzymes
for the synthesis of cyclic six-membered ring amines. While our
ERed/IRed method afforded the synthesis of trans-1,2 and cis-
1,3 substituted cyclohexylamines, the EneIRED method
afforded the synthesis of one cis-1,2 and one trans-1,3
stereoisomer.
99
Furthermore, as a proof of concept, we could
obtain all four possible stereoisomers when 3-methylcyclohex-
2-en-1-one (1a) was converted into secondary and tertiary
chiral amines, thus highlighting the modularity and potential
versatility of our approach. In general, this work highlights the
potential of enzyme cascades for the highly selective synthesis
of complex molecules possessing multiple stereogenic centers.
Future research must focus on the engineering and discovery
of more EReds and IReds possessing complementary stereo-
selectivity, improved stability, and a broader substrate scope.
Such research efforts will elevate the impact of biocatalytic
retrosynthesis on the sustainable synthesis of chiral organic
molecules.
