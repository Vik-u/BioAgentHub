In the published article, there was an error inAfﬁliation 1. It should be“Department
of Chemical, Biological and Environmental Engineering, Universitat Autònoma de
Barcelona, Bellaterra (Cerdanyola del Vallès), Catalonia, Spain.”
There was a misspelling in the article title of the word“Hydroxyproprionic.” The
correct title should be“Combining Metabolic Engineering and Multiplexed Screening
Methods for 3-Hydroxypropionic Acid Production inPichia pastoris.”
