ABSTRACT: 1,4-Dicarbonyls are versatile synthons for the
construction of diverse pharmacophores and natural products.
However, the stereoselective synthesis of densely functionalized
1,4-dicarbonyls is challenging. Here, we report a versatile
biocatalytic route to access chiral 2,3-dihydroxy-1,4-diketones in
high yields and up to gram scale using D -fructose-6-phosphate
aldolase (EcFSA). The utility of these compounds as synthons is
exemplified in enzyme cascades with subsequent regio- and
stereoselective enzymatic transamination to form densely function-
alized homochiral 1-pyrrolines followed by chemical or enzymatic reduction to tetrasubstituted pyrrolidines.
■
INTRODUCTION
1,4-Dicarbonyl compounds are versatile synthetic intermedi-
ates for the synthesis of heterocycles and bioactive fragments.
1
2,3-Disubstituted-1,4-diketones (1) are particularly valuable
for generation of highly functionalized heterocycles (Figure
1A,B) including pyrroles,
2,3
thiophenes,
4
pyridazines,
5
pyrro-
lidines (2 and 3), pyrrolines (4),
6−8
and furans (5).
9,10
The
1,4-diketone moiety is also present in natural products and can
be converted into pharmacophores such as sugar polyols,
diketone sugars or cyclopentenones (6, Figure 1).
11−14
In comparison to 1,3- and 1,5-dicarbonyls, the synthesis of
1,4-diketones is a challenging process due to the inherent
mismatch in carbonyl polarity. Consequently, these com-
pounds are often synthesized by umpolung type chemistries
that leverage inverse carbonyl reactivity.
1
A classic example of
this approach is the Stetter reaction; a 1,4 conjugate addition
of an aldehyde onto an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl which
proceeds via an N-heterocyclic carbene intermediate. Recent
developments allow for enantioselective variants of this
reaction and have proven to be a versatile tool for 1,4-
dicarbonyl synthesis.
1,15−18
Other chemical approaches to
dicarbonyls include radical additions,
15,19,20
enolate cou-
plings
21,22
and alkene carbonylation.
23
Organocatalytic aldol
reactions have also recently been reported to allow access to a
panel of chiral 2,3-disubstituted-1,4-diketones.
24,25
Despite the
plethora of synthetic methodologies for preparation of 1,4-
dicarbonyls, the stereoselective synthesis of 2,3-disubstituted
nonsymmetrical 1,4-diketones with high enantiopurity remains
a significant challenge.
1,15,17,26
Furthermore, the requirement
for protection strategies hampers the synthesis and diversifi-
cation of polyhydroxylated targets such as iminosugars 2, 3 and
4 (Figure 1B).
Biocatalysis is an attractive technology for the enantiose-
lective synthesis of complex fragments without the need for
protecting groups.
27,28
Enzymatic catalysis of 1,4-dicarbonyl
forming Stetter reactions was discovered using thiamine
diphosphate (ThDP)-dependent carboligases such as the
biosynthetic enzymes PigD and MenD.
29,30
In these enzymes,
the umpolung reactive intermediate is generated by decarbox-
ylation of an α-keto acid (e.g., pyruvate or α-ketogluta-
rate).
29−33
Similar reactivity has also been described within
benzaldehyde lyase (BAL), another ThDP-dependent lyase
that typically catalyzes 1,2 additions similar to benzoin
reaction.
34
Chen et al. showed that benzaldehyde lyase was
capable of performing intramolecular Stetter additions to
furnish chroman-4-one scaffolds in good to excellent yields and
enantiopurity. More recently, MacAulay et al. demonstrated
that conjugation of a thiamine-inspired N-heterocyclic carbene
to a steroid carrier protein creates an artificial “Stetterase” from
an otherwise inert protein scaffold.
35
Enzymatic, regiospecific
oxidation of sugars can also yield 1,4-diketones and
ketoaldehydes. In this way, a number of synthetic building
blocks and potential artificial sweeteners have been synthe-
sized.
13,14,36
The synthetic approach developed in this work exploits D -
fructose-6-phosphate aldolase (FSA) to generate a library of
2,3-dihydroxylated-1,4-diketones from simple, achiral precur-
sors (Figure 1C). FSA has a broad scope for both nucleophile
and electrophile substrates including highly electrophilic
methylglyoxal, hydroxypyruvaldehyde phosphate (HPP), and

2,3-dihydroxy-3-phenylpropanal as electrophiles.
37−43
In these
cases the diketone or 5-hydroxyketone products spontaneously
cyclize to produce flavor and fragrance compounds, diulose
sugars or C6-aryl carbohydrates.
43−46
Thus, we sought to
expand the electrophile scope of FSA to arylated glyoxals and
produce chiral 2,3-dihydroxy-1,4-diketones flanked by aryl and
alkyl substituents (Figure 1C).
As part of our ongoing research interest in the synthesis of
natural and abiotic aminopolyols and iminosugars
47,48
it was
envisaged that 2,3-dihydroxylated-1,4-diketones would serve as
ideal intermediates toward 2-aryl iminosugars. As illustrated by
the plant alkaloid natural products codonopsine and radic-
amine B (2 and 3, Figure 1B),
8,49−51
these uncommon arylated
iminosugars (and their precursor imines, e.g., 4) are
glycosidase inhibitors and antibiotics (MRSA).
52,53
Some
analogous compounds also inhibit nucleoside hydrolases,
acting as C-nucleoside mimics.
54,55
Based on precedents for
biocatalytic synthesis of chiral aminopolyols and iminosu-
gars;
47,56,57
the diversification of the FSA derived compounds
with transaminase (TA) and imine reductase (IRED)
biocatalysts was explored (Figure 1C). However, the trans-
formation of complex targets with multiple reactive centers and
hydroxyl substituents is not trivial and strict regio- and
stereochemical control would be key to success of this
strategy.
47,48,58
The goals of this approach were: (i) to enable
synthetic diversity through exploration of enzyme substrate
scope, (ii) to evaluate the synthetic versatility of intermediates,
and (iii) to identify novel enzyme activity on challenging
polyhydroxylated substrates.

RESULTS [TC16]AND DISCUSSION
Screening of EcFSA for Activity toward Aryl Glyoxals.
The wild-type EcFSA was first evaluated for its activity in the
aldol addition of hydroxyacetone (HA, a) to phenylglyoxal 7.
Good conversion (91%) was observed and the panel of
electrophile substrates was expanded(7−23, Figure 2A).
Additionally, dihydroxyacetone (DHA, b) and 1-hydroxybu-
tan-2-one (HB, c) were screened as nucleophile substrates.
Based on previous protein engineering work, EcFSA variant
A129S was also screened, as it has shown improved conversion
in reactions with DHA (b).
59
UPLC-QDa analysis of biotransformations showed good to
high conversions (49−99%) for both EcFSA wt and A129S
across the panel of substrates with HA (a, Figure 2A) and
moderate conversions with DHA and HB (b 0−96% and c
22−90%, Figure 2A). Prior work with these aldolases have
shown that the structural and electronic influence of aryl
moieties can affect the acceptance of electrophile substrates.
60
Indeed, the only previous examples of FSA acting upon related
2-oxoaldehydes utilize highly electrophilic 2-oxoalkanals as the
electrophilic substrate. The electrophile substrate scope of
EcFSA tested herein was broad, and a range of functionality
and substitution patterns were accepted (Figure 2A). Chemi-
cally useful handles such as brominated and chlorinated
compounds 8, 12 and 13 showed higher conversions than the
unsubstituted phenylglyoxal 7 and an azidated derivative (19)
was also well accepted. Free and methylated hydroxyl groups
were accepted (11, 15 and 16), as well as fluorinated
derivatives (9, 10, 18, and 20). Surprisingly, the bulky 6-
methoxynaphthylglyoxal 21 was the best substrate, highlighting
the potential of EcFSA to generate diverse product libraries.
The nonarylated substrates, glyoxylic acid 22 and trifluoropyr-
uvaldehyde 23, were also accepted, demonstrating a broader
utility for the EcFSA-catalyzed synthesis of 1,4-keto acids and
nonsymmetric-1,4-diketones bearing two different alkyl sub-
stituents (Figure 2). No detrimental effects of the hydrate-
aldehyde equilibrium of the glyoxal substrates were observed
suggesting that the aldolase reaction has a sufficient driving
force to outcompete this equilibrium.
Preparative-Scale Aldolase Reactions and Chiral
Analysis. Aldolase reactions were scaled up at increased
substrate loading when feasible (100 mM with 10−20 v%
DMSO). However, due to solubility limitations the scale up
was performed at 25 mM for 8 and 21 and 50 mM for 14.
Products were purified by extraction and column chromatog-
raphy where necessary. Accordingly, aldol products 7a, 7c, 8a,
9a, 14a, 20a, 21a and 22a were isolated in 51% to 93% yield
(124 mg−1.15 g, Figure 2B). The chirality of aldol adducts 7a
and 9a were confirmed to be the (2S,3S) stereoisomer by X-ray
crystallography (CCDC 2360546 and 2360547). This is
consistent with the FSA literature as C2 has inverted CIP
priorities due to the adjacent ketone functionality. Chiral
HPLC and NMR analysis of crude and purified products also
indicates formation of a single major stereoisomer (Figures
S32−S36). The electrophile scope and stereoselectivity of the
reactions catalyzed by EcFSA are complementary to a reported
organocatalytic method, while enabling the use of equimolar

substrate concentrations and additional nucleophilic sub-
strates.
25
With a library of aldolase derived diketones in hand, the
enzymatic diversification of these compounds was investigated.
Previously, simple 1,4-diketones have been utilized as
substrates in the enzymatic cascade synthesis of pyrrolidine
alkaloids using transaminase (TA), imine reductase (IRED)
and monoamine oxidase biocatalysts.
6,7,61−64
However, the
synthesis of tetrasubstituted pyrrolidines in this manner
remains challenging due to the unavailability of the
corresponding 1,4-diketone precursors.
6,7,61,63
By expanding
upon these existing methodologies, the aldolase derived 2,3-
dihydroxy-1,4-dicarbonyls provide an ideal test-bed to
demonstrate the chemoselectivity of biocatalysis on substrates
with multiple reactive sites. The decision to screen trans-
aminase and reductase biocatalysts was bolstered by successful
implementation of these enzymes in concert in the literature,
where chiral aminopolyols, γ-hydroxy-α-amino acids and
valuable heterocycles were synthesized.
37,47,56,65−70
However,
the question remained as to how applicable these strategies
would be on complex targets with multiple reactive centers and
hydroxyl substituents.
Screening of TA for Activity toward FSA Aldol
Products. A panel of transaminase biocatalysts was evaluated
for the transamination of the aldol adduct 7a.
71−73
A screen of
biotransformations was performed using 5 mM substrate 7a
and 5 equiv of L -alanine as a common amine donor. Three
enzymes, the commercial ATA 113 from Codexis, RhTA
74
from Rhodobacter sphaeroides and pQR2191 TA
75
from a
household drain metagenome were found to generate a new
signal in the
1
H NMR corresponding to the product 7ai in 11,
15, and 37% conversion, respectively (SI Figures S39 and
S40). The metagenomic transaminase pQR2191, which is
known to be active against pharmaceutically relevant cyclic
ketones and ketose sugars, was taken forward for reaction
optimization and implementation into the FSA-TA cas-
cade.

specified.

Optimization of the Transamination Step and FSA-
TA Cascade Implementation. Following the promising
results from the preliminary screening, the transamination
conditions for substrate 7a were subsequently optimized with
purified pQR2191 TA. Throughout these experiments, the
buffer and reaction temperature were kept constant to ensure
compatibility of conditions in the planned FSA-TA cascade.
According to the literature, the pQR2191 TA displays good
activity with isopropylamine (IPA) as the amine donor. The
use of this substrate results in a higher atom economy and a
shift of the reaction equilibrium toward the amine product, due
to the formation of volatile acetone as a byproduct.
77−79
A
reaction conducted with low concentration of the catalyst and
the amine donor IPA leads to a promising initial yield of 26%
(SI Table S5). Increasing the concentration of either the
enzyme or IPA has a strong effect on the conversion, with
reactions completed with 2 mg·mL
−1
of purified pQR2191 TA
or 10 equiv of IPA. The reactions were monitored by
1
H
NMR, where a characteristic shift of the methyl signal of the
substrate (2.34 ppm, 3H, s) to a 3H doublet at 1.31 ppm
indicates that the less hindered methyl ketone was aminated as
expected.
The FSA-TA cascade was subsequently investigated as either
a telescoped or sequential one-pot process (Figure 3 and SI
Table S6). In the telescoped cascade all reaction components
are added simultaneously, whereas in the sequential mode the
aldolase reaction is allowed to proceed for 24 h before addition
of the transaminase reaction components. The conditions of
the FSA-TA cascade were optimized by varying enzyme
concentrations with a constant amount of IPA (SI Table S6).
Very good conversions were achieved with the substrates
phenylglyoxal 7 and hydroxyacetone a in both telescoped and
sequential cascades. A telescoped reaction on 0.5 mmol scale
gave an isolated yield of 74% of 7ai (Figure 3). HRMS analysis
of transaminase product 7ai gave m/z = 192.1019,
corresponding to the [M + H]
+
of the cyclized 3,4-dihydro-
2H-pyrrole (1-pyrroline) species 7ai.
13
C NMR revealed the
disappearance of one carbonyl environment, as expected with
conversion a ketone to an amine and a shift of the other signal
in the carbonyl region, further supporting the formation of the
cyclic imine product 7ai. The presence of a single new doublet
peak for the CH
3
suggests that a single new diastereomer has
been formed from the less hindered ketone in the substrate.
The
3
J
H−H
coupling constants along the C4−C5 and C3−C4
bonds and comparison with known compounds suggest that
the protons on C4−C5 are cis to each other,
80
and the protons
on C3−C4 are trans, as expected from the aldolase derived
stereochemistry for C3 & C4. Taken together, these data
suggest the formation of the S stereochemistry at the new
amine center in accordance with previous work with this
transaminase.
75,76
The reported synthetic route to this analogous 2-aryl-1-
pyrroline iminosugar involves six synthetic steps and
protection of all hydroxyl groups of the starting material, D -
ribose. The key aryl moiety is introduced via an elegant
tandem addition-cyclization of an aryl-Grignard reagent and
the D -ribose derived methanesulfonylglycononitrile.
80
Cyclic
sugar imines have also been accessed previously via chemo-
enzymatic synthesis using DHAP-dependent aldolases and
azidoaldehyde precursors as masked amine equivalents.
81
In
contrast to the two methods described above, the FSA-TA
cascade described herein can furnish sterechemically comple-
mentary pyrrolines from diverse aryl glyoxals in a telescoped or
sequential one-pot process without need of any protecting
groups.
The scope of the cascade was extended to encompass 1-
pyrroline products 8ai, 9ai, and 7ci (Figure 3 and SI Table
S6). Interestingly, the sequential cascade yielded better results
for product 8ai in comparison to a telescoped sequence. This
difference might be explained by a substrate inhibition of the
transaminase, a high activity toward one of the substrates or a
mismatch in relative rates of the aldolase and transaminase
catalysts in the telescoped sequence. Nevertheless, 8ai was
isolated in a 30% yield from the sequential cascade. Sequential
and telescoped cascades gave good conversions and isolated
yields for 6ai. Unfortunately, low conversions were observed
for the product 7ci on analytical scale. In this case, an ethyl
group has to be accommodated in the small pocket of the
binding site of the transaminase, which is commonly reported
to be a challenge for wild-type enzymes of this class.
82−87
The
screening or engineering of transaminases with expanded
substrate scope toward these bulky substrates would further
expand the synthetic potential of this approach.
Reduction of Biocatalytically Synthesized Pyrrolines
and Screening of Imine Reductases. Polyhydroxlated
substrates are known to be challenging for typical imine
reductases due to the polarity of the enzyme active site
architecture or potential interference of promiscuous alcohol
dehydrogenase activity giving rise to false positive hits or
undesirable byproducts.

toward diversification of the FSA derived diketones, a panel of
384 metagenomic IREDs was screened against diketone 9a for
reductive amination with cyclopropylamine. This screen
returned only a handful of enzymes exhibiting trace product
formation (<5% by UPLC-QDa, SI Figures S143 and S144),
supporting the hypothesis that the densely functionalized
structures explored in this work are challenging substrates for
IREDs. As such, a targeted panel of previously characterized
IREDs and RedAms were rationally selected based on related
literature substrate scope and screened for activity against the
3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrole (1-pyrroline) product 7ai (Figure 4
and SI Figure S60).
47,48,58,63,88,89
The chemical reduction of pyrroline 7ai was achieved by
treatment with NH
3
BH
3
after an initial, unsuccessful attempt
with NaCNBH
3
left 7ai unreacted. Accordingly, NH
3
BH
3
mediated imine reduction provided the pyrrolidine product
7aii in 99% yield (as measured by
1
H NMR) as a mixture of
two diastereomers (6:4 d.r., Figure 4). The identified
reductases were first screened against 7ai using QDa mass
spectrometry, whereby three enzymes, AniN6, NhIRED and
AdRedAm, appeared to give rise to a new species with m/z
194, corresponding to the pyrrolidine product 7aii (Figure
S61).
Reductase biotransformations were subsequently monitored
by
1
H NMR which showed that AdRedAm provided 31%
NMR yield after 24 h, and 59% after 48 h and a second enzyme
addition, and NhIREDafforded 30% of amine product after 48
h and two enzyme additions. Interestingly, the major
diastereomer formed with both enzymes corresponds to the
minor diastereomer formed upon chemical reduction. No
conversion was observed in biotransformations with AniN6 by
1
H NMR. Attempts to increase product formation by
increasing enzyme loading and reaction time to 2.5 mg·mL
−1
and 48−72 h were unsuccessful. The reaction with AdRedAm
conducted at a larger scale (5 mL) was significantly slower
than at analytical (0.5 mL) scale, as seen in previous work with
this enzyme on challenging substrates.
63
Similarly, attempts to
incorporate AdRedAm into the FSA-TA cascade established
above were not fruitful, with only 9−12% conversion to
pyrrolidine seen by
1
H NMR (Table S9).
Previous synthetic methods toward comparable compounds
in this class of 2-aryl pyrrolidine iminosugars generally involve
long synthetic sequences, multiple protection strategies and
reliance upon chiral pool reagents.
8,52,91−93
For example, El-
Nezhawy et al. developed an eight step synthesis of diverse
codonopsine analogs from D -tartaric acid,
8
the group of Behr
have demonstrated the synthesis of 2-aryl pyrroline and
pyrrolidine iminosugars from D -ribose in seven to 11 steps
using Grignard reagents to introduce the key aryl moiety.
52,80
Similarly, Toyao et al. used a key Grignard addition to furnish
(−)-codonopsinine from L -lyxose via a sugar derived nitrone in
11 steps.
91
A more concise synthesis of (−)-codonopsinine was
described by Reddy et al.,
93
where six synthetic steps from D -
alanine furnish the pyrrolidine scaffold via asymmetric
Sharpless dihydroxylation and acid catalyzed amidocyclisation.
In comparison, at present our methodology provides one-
pot access to 2-aryl pyrroline iminosugars without need of any
protecting groups. Preliminary findings indicate that reductive
aminases or a chemical reduction are capable of furnishing the
2-aryl pyrroline scaffold in a further synthetic step albeit with
imperfect stereocontrol. Despite the inability to perform
preparative synthesis of the pyrrolidine iminosugars using
these wild-type reductases, the stereoselectivity (d.r. 9:1)
observed in biotransformations with AdRedAm is promising. It
is anticipated that protein engineering or directed evolution of
AdRedAm could provide a more synthetically utile biocatalyst
capable of reducing these challenging substrates but such
efforts are outside the scope of this work.

CONCLUSIONS
The enzymatic synthesis of chiral 2,3-dihydroxy-1,4-dicarbon-
yls, which are versatile synthons for the synthesis of highly
functionalized (hetero)cyclic scaffolds from simple, achiral
precursors is described. D -Fructose-6-phosphate aldolase from
Escherichia coli (EcFSA) is shown to catalyze the synthesis of a
diverse library of arylated-1,4-diketones and a dihydroxy-1,4-
keto acid with remarkable efficiency. Preparative reactions
provide good product yields and XRD analysis identified the
2S,3S enantiomer, which is consistent with FSA stereochemical
outcome reported in the literature. Furthermore, the down-
stream synthetic potential of these compounds is exemplified.
The identification and implementation of an (S)-selective
transaminase enables the cascade synthesis of chiral 2-aryl-1-
pyrroline iminosugars with three new stereocenters in a regio-
and stereoselective manner. Finally, preliminary findings
suggest that the fungal reductive aminase AdRedAm is a
promising candidate for protein engineering or directed
evolution of a stereoselective iminosugar imine reductase. By
identifying and engineering stereocomplementary enzymes, we
anticipate that this procedure will provide a platform for
exploring the structure−activity relationships of highly
functionalized hydroxylated heterocycles and developing new
pharmaceutically relevant fragments.
