Abstract
Transaminases (TAms) are important enzymes for the production of chiral amines for the pharmaceutical and fine chemical
industries. Novel TAms for use in these industries have been discovered using a range of approaches, including activity-guided

mining of environmental DNA libraries. This mini-review focuses on the methods used for TAm discovery over the past two
decades, analyzing the changing trends in the field and highlighting the advantages and drawbacks of the respective approaches
used. This review will also discuss the role of protein engineering in the development of novel TAms and explore possible
directions for future TAm discovery for application in industrial biocatalysis.

Introduction
Transaminases (TAms) are increasingly important enzymes
for the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries, capable
of producing valuable chiral amine drug intermediates from a
prochiral precursor in a single step (Ghislieri and Turner 2013;
Kelly et al. 2018a).
TAms have a number of advantages over conventional
chemical synthesis of chiral amines, including excellent
stereoselectivity, as well a s an ability to perform under mild
conditions, replacement of oftentoxic transition metal catalysts
as alternative technology, and reduction of the use of volatile
organic solvents (VOCs) in chemical manufacturing. The best
known example of TAm application in the pharmaceutical in-
dustry is in the production of t he antidiabetic drug sitagliptin
(Savile et al. 2010). In this case, a combination of in silico
design and directed evolution were used to engineer the en-
zyme’s large binding pocket, improving activity towards its
ketone substrate, prositagliptin, and improving stability to the
conditions required for substrate solubilization. The final mu-
t a n tr e s u l t e di na no v e r a l ly i e l di n c r e a s eo f1 0–13%, 53% in-
crease in productivity and 19% reduction in total waste, com-
pared to the use of chemical methods. The TAm-catalyzed re-
action negated the need for a toxic transition metal catalyst and
expensive high-pressure hydrogenation equipment, conferring
further advantages over the conventional approach.
Biocatalysis has been increasingly employed to improve and
streamline chemical syntheses, increasing with it the demand
for new and enhanced enzymes for application in these process-
es. As a result, novel TAms continue to be discovered, from a
wide variety of sources using different discovery methods.

The Author(s) 2020
There have been a number of excellent TAm reviews writ-
ten in recent years, focusing on a range of topics including
classification, application, engineering, and optimization of
TAms and their reactions (Guo and Berglund 2017; Ferrandi
and Monti 2018;G o m ma n dO ’Reilly 2018; Kelly et al.
2018a; Patil et al. 2018). This mini-review will focus on the
approaches used in novel wild-type TAm discovery over the
past two decades, highlighting the changing trends in the field
during this time. It will also scrutinize the benefits and draw-
backs of the various discovery approaches and provide com-
ment on possible directions for future TAm discovery for ap-
plication in industrial biocatalysis.
Culture-based enzyme discovery
Activity-guided enzyme discovery
The first examples of TAm discovery and exploitation for
biocatalysis were from cultured soil bacteria. This work was
largely pioneered by Shin and Kim in the late 1990s and early
2000s, with early examples including TAms from Klebsiella
pneumoniae JS2F and Bacillus thuringiensis JS64 (Shin and
Kim 1997). Enrichment cultures using 1-phenylethylamine
(1-PEA) as sole nitrogen source were used to identify organ-
isms harboring a TAm capable of metabolizing this amine.
This culture-based approach yielded one of the most well-
characterized TAms, an ( S)-selective enzyme from Vibrio
fluvialis (Vf-TAm) (Shin and Kim 1999). Much of what is
understood about TAms today comes from investigations in-
volving Vf-TAm, including the two-site binding pocket archi-
tecture of TAms, which was proposed based on observations
of this enzyme (Shin and Kim 2002).
Shifting the equilibrium of the TAm-catalyzed reaction to
enhance product formation was also investigated using Vf-
TAm, through the use of L-alanine as an amino donor and
removal of the pyruvate co-product using lactate dehydroge-
nase (LDH) (Shin and Kim 1999). Alleviating product inhi-
bition with alternative amino donors was investigated using
Vf-TAm, by employing a biphasic system to remove the benz-
aldehyde co-product in a reaction which produced an inter-
mediate for the anti-epilepsy drug levetiracetam (Shin and
Kim 2009). Vf-TAm has been used in the synthesis of a num-
ber of other pharmaceutical intermediates, including ( S)-
rivastigmine, a drug used in Alzheimer ’s disease and demen-
tia associated with Parkinson ’s disease (Fuchs et al. 2010). In
this example, pyruvate removal was facilitated through the
use of an LDH-based system outlined above, further increas-
ing the efficiency of the process. The same research group
combined Vf-TAm in a cascade reaction with a galactose
oxidase enzyme, affording an amine intermediate for the po-
tent antifungal drug naftifine, using an alcohol starting mate-
rial (Fuchs et al. 2012)
Following the initial success of work by Shin and Kim, a
number of other S-selective TAms were discovered using en-
richment media in a culture-dependent approach, including
those from Alcaligenes denitrificans Y2k-2 ( Ad-TAm) (Yun
et al. 2004), Mezorhizobium sp. LUK ( Mz-TAm) (Kim et al.
2007), and Bacillus megaterium SC6394 (Bm-TAm) (Hanson
et al. 2008). Bm-TAm has been used in the synthesis of ( R)-
sec-butylamine and ( R)-1-cyclopropylethylamine, important
intermediates for corticotropin releasing factor (CRF-1) antag-
onists (Hanson et al. 2008), which have been proposed for the
treatment of depression and anxiety.
Other variations of culture-dependent TAm mining have
been applied successfully for the discovery of S-selective
TAms, including gas chromatography-based screening of
whole-cell preparations for the ability to convert 1-PEA
(Clay et al. 2010) and metabolic function analysis (Lang
et al. 2009; Weber et al. 2014)
The first R-selective TAm was also discovered using an
activity-guided approach. An ω-TAm from Arthrobacter sp.
KNK168 ( Arth-TAm) was isolated from soil bacteria using
enrichment media containing 3,4-dimethoxyamphetamine as
the sole nitrogen source (Iwasaki et al. 2003). This enzyme,
and subsequent mutated variants, has had a profound effect on
the application of TAms in pharmaceutical production. Protein
engineered mutants of Arth-TAm have been applied in the
asymmetric synthesis of the dual orexin receptor antagonist,
suvorexant (Mangion et al. 2012), of silodosin, a pro-drug for
the treatment of benign prostatic hypertrophy (Simon et al.
2014), and the anti-arrhythmic, mexiletine (Koszelewski
et al. 2009), among others. Indeed, the most highly publicized
and successful application of TAm biocatalysis was using an
engineered variant of Arth-TAm, in the synthesis of the anti-
diabetic drug sitagliptin, an example highlighted previously
(Savile et al. 2010).
Discovery of R-selective wild-type TAms using activity-
guided approaches has resulted in limited success, with only
a handful of such enzymes uncovered in this way. Using R-
amines as the sole nitrogen source in enrichment media,
Pavkov-Keller and co-workers discovered and characterized
R-selective TAms from Curtobacterium pusillum and
Microbacterium ginsengisoli (Pavkov-Keller et al. 2016).
These enzymes were not easily classified along with previous-
ly known TAms, given their structural similarity to D-amino
acid TAms and branched-chain amino acid TAms, combined
with their ability to accept amines as substrates. As such, this
study forced a rethink about PLP fold-type IV TAms, and to
reassess what is known about structure-function relationships
in this group. This would not have been possible without the
biochemical characterization following activity-guided dis-
covery, once again highlighting the benefits of this approach.
Activity-guided enzyme discovery from cultured microor-
ganisms remained the gold standard for uncovering novel en-
zymes for several years following its initial successes. While a
4782 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2020) 104:4781 –4794
number of other discovery approaches have emerged in recent
years, such as culture-independent metagenome screening,
novel enzymes continue to be discovered in this way
(Fig. 1) (Wilding et al. 2015 , 2016 ;W ue ta l . 2017 ;
Noshahri et al. 2019). In the latter example by Noshahri
et al., the decades-old approach of using enrichment media
with 1-PEA as the sole nitrogen source was given a new lease
of life by applying this method to microorganisms from chal-
lenging environments. TAms from Bacillus halotolerans and
Bacillus subtilis subsp. stercoris were isolated from a petro-
leum refinery and an oil field respectively. The resulting en-
zymes showed tolerance to organic solvents, performing best
in 30% DMSO, as well as an acidophilic profile (optimum
activity at pH 5, with 70% activity remaining at pH 3)
(Noshahri et al. 2019). Recent examples like this serve to
reinforce the benefits of continuing to use activity-guided
methods for enzyme discovery, in particular when the advan-
tages of this approach can be extended to previously untapped
and extreme environments. TAms discovered using activity-
guided approaches, as well as those discovered from other
culture-dependent methods, are summarized in Table 1.
Homologous sequence searching
The advent of cost-effective genome sequencing, and the sub-
sequent effect this has had in bolstering sequence databases,
has transformed the way we search for new enzymes.
Searching for TAm sequences homologous to those uncov-
ered using activity-guided approaches has massively in-
creased the speed at which new functional sequences can be
found and allows us to benefit from the vast sequence data
available in both private and public databases.
Unsurprisingly, given its early successes, homologs were
sought for Vf-TAm. Using the archetypal Vf-TAm sequence as
a template, ω-TAm from Chromobacterium violaceum (Cv-
TAm) was discovered and characterized (Kaulmann et al.
2007). Cv-TAm remains one of the most characterized and
utilized TAms and has been employed in the synthesis of a
number of pharmaceutical intermediates, including the throm-
boxane receptor antagonist, ramatroban (Busto et al. 2014),
and the decongestant, norephedrine (Sehl et al. 2013).
As outlined previously, Vf-TAm was employed by Fuchs
et al. in the synthesis of the cholinesterase inhibitor,
rivastigmine. The same group discovered a novel TAm from
Paracoccus denitrificans (Pd-TAm) based on sequence ho-
mology to Vf-TAm and was able to use this new enzyme to
improve the biocatalytic process used in rivastigmine synthe-
sis (Fuchs et al. 2010).
Following successful homology searches using enzymes
discovered with an activity-guided approach, a natural pro-
gression in TAm discovery was to use these newly discovered
enzymes as templates in further homologous sequence
searches. The use of Pd-TAm as a template sequence yielded
a number of novel TAms (Park et al. 2012). One of these
enzymes from Ochrobacterium anthropi(Oa-TAm) was com-
bined in a cascade with an α-TAm to aminate α-keto acids for
the production of unnatural amino acids. A number of bioac-
tives, such as the ACE inhibitor perindopril and the antidia-
betic saxagliptin, have been synthesized in this way, as well as
intermediates for antibiotics and HIV drugs.
Chains consisting of several rounds of homologous se-
quence searches can be followed, such as that beginning with
Mz-TAm, discovered following an activity-guided approach
using enrichment media. Using Mz-TAm as a template, a β-
TAm from Polaromonassp. JS666 ( Po-TAm) was discovered
(Bea et al. 2011). In recent work by Kim and co-workers (Kim
et al. 2019a, b), Po-TAm was used as a template, yielding eight
novel TAms, among them an enzyme from Ilumatobacter
coccineus(Ic-TAm). Within this same study,Ic-TAm was then
used as a template in homology searches, yielding a further
eight novel TAms for characterization (Table 1)( K i me ta l .
2019a). This example highlights the powerful and iterative na-
ture of mining sequence databases for putative sequences,
followed by characterization and feeding this data back into
the search engine, enhancing knowledge of sequence-function
relationships and improving future searches.

While each iteration of homologous sequence searching
uncovers novel sequences for putative enzymes, using se-
quence similarity as the sole basis for biocatalyst mining
has some key drawbacks. As the search is based on overall
sequence similarity, “similar” enzyme hits are indeed what
tends to be found. This can be observed in a number of

examples in the phylogenetic tree presented in Fig. 2,
where newly discovered TAms are quite closely related to
the query sequences from which they were found. This can
be also seen in the example above, with Po-TAm and Ic-
TAm used as search sequences. All of the novel TAms
discovered during these searches exhibited relatively close
p h y l o g e n yt ot h e i r“parent” enzymes, and each other, all
residing in the same clade within the tree. Similar examples
can be seen with Pd-TAm (found based on homology to Vf-
TAm) and a TAm from Caulobacter crescentus (Hwang
et al. 2008) (found based on homology to Ad-TAm). This
also means that very often the novel enzymes discovered
are functionally quite similar to what already exists in the
TAm toolbox, and more distantly related enzymes, which
may have very useful or unexpected biocatalytic character-
istics, are missed by the search. Furthermore, if we select
enzymes whose similarity is too low, rather than being
novel examples, may not be functional as TAms at all.
This has, in part, led to alternative approaches in the search
for novel, functional TAms using in silico search methods,
or searching in previously untapped or extreme environ-
ments for new enzymes.
Expanding the search to different environments
The majority of early TAms were discovered from
mesophilic microorganisms, with many derived from soil
b a c t e r i a .T h i si su n s u r p r i s i ng given that these organisms
are among the most well-characterized in microbiology as
a whole. Furthermore, they are among the most widely
sequenced; therefore, “hits” from these organisms were
more likely following sequence searching. However, giv-
en the relatively benign environments from which these
organisms are derived, many of their enzymes are unable
to tolerate the harsh reaction conditions often demanded
by industrial processes, such as high temperature and
presence of organic solvents. In order to find wild-type
enzymes which can tolerate these conditions, a number of
research groups have recentl y begun mining the genomes
of microorganisms isolated from extreme environments,
or extremophiles.
UsingVf-TAm as query sequence, Chen et al. (2016) found a
TAm in the genome of the thermophilic bacterium,Geobacillus
thermodenitrificans(Gb-TAm). Despite using a sequence from
a mesophilic bacterium as a template, by mining a

which it is derived. St-TAm exhibited superior thermostability
and activity at higher temp eratures (60 °C) than the Po-TAm
enzyme used to discover it, highlighting the benefits of interro-
gating the genomes of extremophiles in the search for robust
enzymes (Mathew et al. 2016b).
The genomes of halophilic microorganisms have also been
explored for TAms using similar methods. The Paradisi group
characterized the first ω-TAm from a halophilic bacterium
following a homologous sequence search with Vf-TAm. The
resultant TAm from Halomonas elongata showed tolerance to
organic solvents and optimum activity at pH 10 (Cerioli et al.
2015). A similar enzyme, Ad2-TAm, was characterized from
the genome of Halomonas sp. CSM-2, a moderately halophil-
ic bacterium isolated from a Triassic period salt mine. Ad2-
TAm displayed no loss of function up to 1.5 M NaCl and
organic solvent tolerance, as well as the ability to function in
a seawater reaction medium (Kelly et al. 2017, 2019b).
Given the relative dearth of R-selective TAms uncovered
using activity-guided approaches, it is not surprising that the
number of characterized R-selective enzymes found using ho-
mology searches is much lower than their S-selective counter-
parts. Indeed, many R-selective TAms discovered using
overall sequence homology appear to come from microorgan-
isms other than bacteria. Gao et al. ( 2017) characterized an R-
selective TAm from the fungus Fusarium oxysporum (Gao
et al. 2017), while the first haloarchaeal TAm characterized
for use in biocatalysis (BC61-TAm) was isolated from the
genome of Halorubrum sp. CSM-61 (Kelly et al. 2019a).
These examples reinforce the benefit of mining genomes from
previously untapped or extreme environments, with both
yielding relatively scarce and valuable R
-selective TAms.
The numbers of S- and R-selective enzymes discovered by
different approaches are shown in Fig. 3.
Discovery using key motifs and protein structure
As highlighted, one of the drawbacks of homologous sequence
searching is the return of similar proteins. As more was under-
stood about structure-function relationships, it became apparent
that the search for novel TAms could center around finding key
motifs, known to be important for function, rather than overall
sequence similarity. By identifying key motifs and active site
residues for function predictioni nP L Pf o l dt y p eI Ve n z y m e s ,
Höhne and co-workers developed an in silico strategy for
sequence-based prediction of substrate specificity and
enantiopreference. Using this approach, 17 novel R-selective
TAms were discovered from databases containing proteins of
cultured organisms (Höhne et al. 2010). Interestingly, many of
the R-selective TAms identified using this approach were de-
rived from the genomes of fungi. The TAms from this study
have already found applications in the asymmetric synthesis of
pharmaceuticals, with one enzyme from Aspergillus fumigatus
combined in a cascade with acetohydroxyacid synthase I in the
synthesis of the decongestant norpseudoephedrine (Sehl et al.
2013). Similar studies have yielded further R-selective TAms
from fungi, including Cordyceps, Nectria, Capronia,a n d

Trichodermaspp. (Sayer et al. 2014; Jiang et al. 2015;I g l e s i a s
et al. 2017). Recent work saw yet another R-selective TAm
isolated using the same approach, this time from Actinobacter
sp., a bacterium which shares a number of characteristics with
fungi (Tang et al. 2019).
As can be seen from these examples, and more broadly in
Fig. 3, the majority of R-selective TAms to date have been
discovered using key motif searches from cultured microorgan-
isms, in particular from fungi. ProfilingR-selective TAms in this
way and highlighting discovery trends can help inform future
mining strategies, which may be particularly useful given the
relative scarcity ofR-selective TAms in the literature at present.
As well as database searching using key motifs, searches
using overall protein structure rather than sequence have
been employed for TAm discovery. This approach has been
driven largely by the Höhne group, resulting in a number of
S-selective TAms (Steffen-Munsberg et al. 2013; Steffen-
Munsberg et al. 2016).
Metagenomic mining for enzyme discovery
Sequence-driven metagenomics
Exploiting the riches of cultured microorganisms has been the
mainstay of TAm discovery from the outset, firstly with
activity-guided approaches, progressing to database mining
through sequence homology, key motif, and protein structure
searches. The drawback of using this approach, however, is
that it can only utilize those microorganisms which can be
cultured. As well as the time and effort required in isolation
and DNA sequencing of individual genomes, it has been sug-
gested that as few as 1% of microorganisms can be cultured in
the laboratory (Rappé and Giovannoni 2003; Schloss and
Handelsman 2004). This leaves the vast majority of microor-
ganisms, and the enzymes encoded therein, inaccessible using
culture-based techniques alone. Isolating DNA directly from
the environment (eDNA) negates the need for culture and
provides access to a far greater breadth of sequences within
a given environment.
Metagenomic mining is still in its infancy, with relatively
few studies compared to those from cultured organisms. This
trend appears to be changing however, with the number of
TAms discovered by metagenomic mining seeing a sharp rise
in recent years (Fig. 1). TAms discovered using metagenomic
mining are shown in Table 2.
In one such study by the Hailes and Ward, 11 putative
TAms were cloned and overexpressed from a metagenome
obtained from the oral cavities of humans (Baud et al. 2017).
An in silico sequence-driven approach was used to find
TAm-encoding sequences, with the Pfam ID for Class III
TAms used to extract open reading frames. The resultant

sequences were cloned and overexpressed using standard
molecular biology techniques and screened against a wide
range of amino donors and carbonyl substrates. This repre-
sents a high throughput and targeted method for identifying
putative TAm sequences from eDNA obtained via culture-
independent means.
The same group used a similar sequence-driven ap-
proach to expand on this work, with a highly successful
study focusing on the retrieval of TAms from a domestic
drain metagenome (Leipold et al. 2019). Of the 36 full-
length, non-redundant Class III TAm sequences found, 29
were successfully cloned and expressed in Escherichia
coli. Percentage identities ranged from 16 to 36% com-
pared to the well-characterized Vf-TAm and 17 –54% with
Cv-TAm, highlighting the novelty which can be achieved
using this approach. The evolutionary diversity in the
TAms from this study can be visualized in Fig. 2,w i t h
sequences well distributed right throughout those of
known S-selective TAms (enzymes from this study were
given the designation pQR2189 to pQR2216). In a sub-
stantial undertaking of characterization, these enzymes
were screened for activity against a variety of amino do-
nors and substrates, under a range of temperatures, pH
values, and organic solvent c oncentrations. Perhaps the
most promising enzyme, pQR2189, displayed the desirable
ability to accept the amino donor isopropylamine (IPAm),
as well as functioning impressively in up to 50% DMSO.
What is arguably the most important conclusion from this
study in terms of TAm discovery is the benefits to be gar-
nered by combining a metagenomic mining approach with
an unusual ecological niche, such as the largely
uncharacterized domestic drain metagenome.
Extreme environments have also been mined for TAms
using sequence-driven metagenomics, most notably from hot
spring metagenomes from Iceland and Italy (Ferrandi et al.
2017). A number of S-selective TAms were discovered via
alignment with query sequences. Despite these query se-
quences being of mesophilic origin, by virtue of searching in
an extreme environment, a number of highly thermophilic
TAms were found. One enzyme in particular, B3-TA, was
found to be particularly thermostable, retaining 85% activity
following incubation at 80 °C for 5 days, with optimum ac-
tivity observed at 90 °C. Unsurprisingly, when the sequence
for B3-TA is aligned against other characterized TAms from
the literature, its closest relative is a TAm from the thermo-
phile T. roseum, discussed previously.
Recent metagenomic mining from a hypersaline environ-
ment also yielded a functional TAm, KMG-TAm4 (Kelly et al.
2018b). In this case, however, the enzyme produced did not
exhibit a halophilic or halotolerant activity profile, as had been
observed in previous enzymes characterized from cultured
microbes from the same source (Kelly et al. 2017, 2019a).
This may be due to the adaptive mechanisms employed by
some halophiles, where the organism as a whole is adapted to
hypersaline environments by excluding salt from the cell,
meaning intracellular enzymes do not themselves need to be
salt-adapted. This also presents a cautionary tale, that even
though a source environment may be extreme, not every en-
zyme represented in its metagenome will exhibit similarly
extreme properties, given the diversity of mechanisms of ex-
treme environment physiological adaptations exhibited by mi-
croorganism colonizing a given environmental niche.
It is worthy of note that all TAms found using sequence-
derived metagenomics are S-selective. This is due largely to
the search criteria used in enzyme discovery, with similarity to
Class III TAms (which are S-selective) sought in studies by the
Hailes and Ward. However, in the studies by Ferrandi et al.
(2017) and Kelly et al. ( 2018b), PLP fold type IV enzymes
were used as query sequences, but in either case, no functional
R-selective TAms were uncovered. While this is a fairly small
sample size and S-selective enzymes are more abundant nat-
urally, it does perhaps highlight the need to use enhanced
search techniques in the quest for novel R-selective enzymes
from metagenomes, such as key motif-based searches which
proved so successful with cultured microorganisms.
Functional metagenomics
Due to the breadth of sequences which can be accessed
through metagenomic mining of eDNA, many novel se-
quences which are distantly related to known enzymes, but
still functional, can be uncovered. As with mining the ge-
nomes of cultured microbes, a sequence-driven approach still
has limitations however, as searching using query sequences
will still, in the main, provide us only with enzymes which are
similar to those already characterized. As detailed earlier,
activity-guided approaches, d espite being constrained by
culturability limitations, have the potential for discovery of
enzymes which are very different to those already described,
as they are not discovered based on sequence similarity to
current enzymes, but on s ubstrate turnover. To pursue
activity-guided approaches from cultured microorganisms is
time consuming and tedious work however, compounded by
the inability to cultivate the vast majority of microorganisms
in a lab setting. This can also result in over-mining an already
restricted and limited resource, namely the 1% culturable por-
tion of a given microbiome. Functional metagenomics could
have a huge part to play in circumventing these shortfalls. This
involves isolating eDNA, cutting it into pieces of a desired
size range and cloning these pieces into expression vectors
directly. Bacteria, usually E. coli , are transformed with the
recombinant vectors and screened for activity. Alternatively,
vectors containing a gene of interest, such as a TAm-encoding
gene, are selected using enrichment media, similar to early
activity-guided screens discussed above.
Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2020) 104:4781 –4794 4789
To date, functional metagenomic studies for TAms are
scarce but have involved the generation of fosmid libraries
for novel enzyme discovery. In one such approach,
metagenomic fosmid libraries from 28 geographically distinct
environments were produced and screened using well-
established agar-based color imetric assays (Green et al.
2014; Baud et al. 2015) to show clones harboring relevant
TAm-encoding sequences (Coscolín et al. 2019). Analysis of
candidates at protein sequence level revealed large divergence
among the Class III TAms identified, with no particular type
of protein dominant.
Of the 10 enzymes characterized, all were S-selective.
Interestingly, however, 4 of these enzymes (TR
2,T R 6,
TR9,a n dT R 10) were able to accept both the S-a n d R-
enantiomers of 2-aminononane. Unlike the other Class III
TAms uncovered by this screen, these enzymes all had a
large pocket volume, a hairpin region close to the con-
served arginine residue at position 414 and an outward
orientation of the Arg414 re sidue itself, although the au-
thors postulate that other factors may be at play in deter-
mining the ability of these enzymes to accept both S-a n d
R-substrates (Coscolín et al. 2019).
Using a similar approach of fosmid library generation
and colorimetric screening using o-xylylenediamine as
amino donor, Pawar and co-workers (Pawar et al. 2018)
discovered a ( S)-selective TAm with a high degree of nov-
elty. pRT15-TA was < 30% similar to Vf-TAm and Cv-
TAm, as well as being 15% shorter. The novelty of this
enzyme can be seen in Fig. 2, with pRT15-TA occupying
a position on its own branch, with considerable evolution-
ary distance from all other characterized TAms. Despite
these differences in sequence, pRT15-TA was stably
expressed in E. coli and capable of accepting a number of
ketone and amine substrates, as well as being the first TAm
to be discovered using a functional metagenomics ap-
proach (Pawar et al. 2018).
As with other discovery methodologies discussed, func-
tional metagenomics is not without limitations. While col-
orimetric screens such as those employed by Coscolín et al.
(2019)a n dP a w a re ta l .( 2018) increase screening efficien-
cy considerably, expression and screening of clones is not
trivial and can be time consuming and resource heavy.
Furthermore, not all enzymes can be easily expressed in
established E. coli -based systems, such as those from
extremophiles, whose characteristics can be very desirable.
To date, expression systems for functional metagenomics
of extremozymes are limited, with no examples of TAms as
yet. Despite these drawbacks, a functional metagenomics
approach provides access to a vast range of genes which
can be screened for functional activity, including from mi-
crobes which cannot be cultured in the lab. As such, it is a
powerful tool which looks set to feature more prominently
in future enzyme discovery attempts.
Protein engineering
While this mini-review focuses largely on the discovery of
novel wild-type enzymes, it would be remiss not to include
some important examples of engineered TAms, given the in-
creasingly influential role rational design plays in TAm bioca-
talysis. As alluded to previously, protein engineering has facil-
itated some of the greatest success stories of TAm application in
the pharmaceutical industry, none more so than the engineered
variant of Arth-TAm, used in the synthesis of sitagliptin.
The number of studies involving protein engineering of
TAms has continued to increase in recent years. Using an in
silico design approach, seven mutations to the well-
characterizedVf-TAm resulted in a 1716-fold increase in reac-
tion rate towards the bulky ketone substrate, 2-acetylbiphenyl
(Dourado et al. 2016). This focused mainly on enlarging the
large binding pocket and increasing hydrophobicity at key res-
idues in order to improve spe cificity and binding. An S-selec-
tive TAm from Ruegeria sp. TM1040 was also rationally de-
signed for the synthesis of bulky chiral amines. The sequence of
the evolved enzyme was used in the discovery of six new TAms
with activity towards bulky substrates (Pavlidis et al. 2016).
This demonstrates the cyclical and iterative nature of biocatalyst
discovery and the value of combining different discovery ap-
proaches. Advances made with protein engineering can be fed
back into the discovery pipeline in the quest for novel wild-type
TAms, as well as new enzymes informing which mutations
may be beneficial in future protein engineering. Similar studies
have improved the activities of other enzymes through protein
engineering such as Oa-TAm (Kim et al. 2019b)a n d Cv-TAm
(Almahboub et al. 2018;V o s se ta l .2018), as well as engineer-
ing a strain of yeast to contain Cv-TAm for application in whole
cell biocatalysis (Braun-Galleani et al. 2019).
Other characteristics have been improved through protein
engineering, such as enhanced thermostability of an R-selec-
tive TAm from Aspergillus terreusthrough the introduction of
disulphide bonds (Xie et al. 2018). Indeed, rational design has
even proved capable of changing the enantiopreference of a
number of TAms. In one such example, the enantiopreference
of Cv-TAm was changed from S-t o R-selective by swapping
phenylalanine and alanine residues at positions 88 and 231
(Humble et al. 2012). Furthermore, work by the Dalby group
has shown that ω-TAm activity can be switched towards α-
TAm activity via protein engineering (Deszcz et al. 2015).
As well as finding the enzymes of the future, rational design

cess described as “reverse engineering” (Wilding et al. 2017).
Ancestral biocatalysts were found to be more promiscuous than
their modern counterparts, with superior activity compared to
their descendants. These results may also help to guide future
wild-type enzyme discovery, suggesting ancient and unspoiled
environments may harbor wild-type ancestral biocatalysts with
naturally promiscuous substrate scopes and high activities.
4790 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2020) 104:4781 –4794
The recently launched ω-Transaminase Engineering
Database (oTAED) brings together protein structure and se-
quence for ω-TAms, classifying enzymes based on fold type
and sequence similarity and applying a standard numbering
scheme for equivalent residues in homologous proteins (Buß
et al. 2018). Functional information is also attributed to resi-
dues where known, making this publicly accessible database a
useful tool in future TAm engineering and discovery studies.
The importance of crystal structures, and indeed good homol-
ogy models, should not be underestimated in its ability to
enhance databases such as oTAED, and therefore TAm protein
engineering overall.
Protein engineering has a vital role in the development of
new TAms with enhanced characteristics, not only in improv-
ing the individual enzyme in each case but also in advancing
knowledge for future engineering and novel TAm discovery.
Lessons learned from protein engineering studies inform fu-
ture searches for wild-type TAms, just as novel TAms with
desirable characteristics can provide a scaffold for protein en-
gineering. As such, protein engineering continues to play a
vital role in the field, enjoying a complementary relationship
with wild-type TAm discovery.
Concluding remarks and outlook
TAm discovery has changed and evolved since the inception
of the field several decades ago, benefitting from improve-
ments in sequencing technologies and burgeoning protein da-
tabases along the way. Early work focused heavily on culture-
dependent, activity-guided approaches, often through the use
of enrichment media to find microbes displaying a desired
phenotype. As sequencing became more cost-effective and
accessible, increasing numbers of TAm sequences became
available. This enabled the mining of vast repositories of
whole genome data for homologous sequences, giving rise
to many of the best characterized TAms in use today.
As more enzymes were discovered and characterized using
both activity-guided and sequence homology approaches,
knowledge of sequence- and structure-function relationships
was improved, allowing key motifs for activity to be identi-
fied. This enabled more targeted database mining of novel
TAms, facilitating the discovery of many new R-selective
TAms in particular.
The advent of metagenomic mining looks set to exert a
significant effect on the field, providing access to vast
amounts of previously inaccessible sequence data. The effects
of this change, while recent, are already being seen, with large
numbers of enzymes discovered and characterized already
from a relatively small number of studies.
Much remains unknown about TAms, with the function of
many conserved residues still to be deciphered. While in silico
enzyme analysis becomes increasingly sophisticated, wet lab
experiments are still required for definitive characterization of
novel enzymes and engineered mutants. In future, the field is
likely to benefit from advances in machine learning, with it-
erative cycles of mining, engineering, testing, and feedback
improving knowledge of structure-function relationships and
enhancing algorithms for further discovery. Continued discov-
ery and characterization of new wild-type enzymes with de-
sirable properties could also feed into these pipelines, helping
to provide a scaffold for biocatalyst design.
TAm biocatalysis has benefitted hugely from all approaches
employed in enzyme discovery, with each approach improving
the knowledge base of the field and informing future discov-
ery. Activity-guided approaches, in particular through func-
tional metagenomic screens of previously untapped ecological
niches, are likely to increase in the coming years. This, com-
bined with protein engineering and searches based on sequence
and structure, looks likely to continue to shape the near future
of novel TAm discovery for industrial biocatalysis.
