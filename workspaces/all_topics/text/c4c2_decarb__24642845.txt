Abstract
C4 photosynthesis affords higher photosynthetic carbon conversion efficiency than C 3 photosynthesis and it there-
fore represents an attractive target for engineering efforts aiming to improve crop productivity. To this end, blueprints 
are required that reflect C4 metabolism as closely as possible. Such blueprints have been derived from comparative 
transcriptome analyses of C 3 species with related C 4 species belonging to the NAD-malic enzyme (NAD-ME) and 
NADP-ME subgroups of C 4 photosynthesis. However, a comparison between C 3 and the phosphoenolpyruvate car -
boxykinase (PEP-CK) subtype of C4 photosynthesis is still missing. An integrative analysis of all three C4 subtypes has 
also not been possible to date, since no comparison has been available for closely related C3 and PEP-CK C4 species. 
To generate the data, the guinea grass Megathyrsus maximus, which represents a PEP-CK species, was analysed in 
comparison with a closely related C
3 sister species, Dichanthelium clandestinum, and with publicly available sets of 
RNA-Seq data from C4 species belonging to the NAD-ME and NADP-ME subgroups. The data indicate that the core 
C4 cycle of the PEP-CK grass M. maximus is quite similar to that of NAD-ME species with only a few exceptions, such 
as the subcellular location of transfer acid production and the degree and pattern of up-regulation of genes encod-
ing C
4 enzymes. One additional mitochondrial transporter protein was associated with the core cycle. The broad 
comparison identified sucrose and starch synthesis, as well as the prevention of leakage of C 4 cycle intermediates 
to other metabolic pathways, as critical components of C 4 metabolism. Estimation of intercellular transport fluxes 
indicated that flux between cells is increased by at least two orders of magnitude in C 4 species compared with C 3 
species. In contrast to NAD-ME and NADP-ME species, the transcription of photosynthetic electron transfer proteins 
was unchanged in PEP-CK. In summary, the PEP-CK blueprint of M. maximus appears to be simpler than those of 
NAD-ME and NADP-ME plants.

Introduction
Plants using C4 photosynthesis display higher carbon conver-
sion efficiency than C 3 plants (Amthor, 2010) and are thus 
among the most productive crop plants. C4 plants also domi-
nate many natural ecosystems because this trait enables effi-
cient growth under water- and nitrogen-limited conditions 
at high temperatures. As the area of available arable land 
decreases and the human population increases, C
4 photo-
synthesis has become a trait of high potential for a second 
green revolution (Hibberd et al., 2008; Maurino and Weber, 
2013). To recreate this complex trait efficiently by synthetic

approaches, a mechanistic understanding of the genetic archi-
tecture controlling the biochemical, anatomical, and regula-
tory aspects of C
4 photosynthesis is required. Although the 
enzymes of the core cycle were discovered >50  years ago, 
knowledge about the metabolism underlying the C
4 trait 
remains incomplete. The engineering potential of C4 metabo-
lism was explored in the guinea grass Megathyrsus maximus.
C4 photosynthesis increases photosynthetic efficiency 
by concentrating CO 2 at the site of Rubisco using a bio-
chemical carbon-concentrating mechanism that is distrib-
uted between two compartments, the mesophyll cell (MC)
and the bundle sheath cell (BSC), in most known C
4 spe-
cies. The trait has convergently evolved at least 60 times 
(Sage et  al., 2011) and always employs phosphoenolpyru-
vate carboxylase (PEPC) to incorporate bicarbonate into 
phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), yielding the four-carbon 
molecule oxaloacetate (OAA). For transfer to the site of 
Rubisco, OAA is converted to either malate by reduction 
or aspartate by transamination. Different evolutionary 
lineages, however, have different means to decarboxylate 
the now-organic carbon to release the CO
2 at the site of 
Rubisco: NADP-dependent malic enzyme (ME) decar -
boxylates malate to pyruvate in chloroplasts; NAD-ME 
decarboxylates malate to pyruvate in mitochondria; and 
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEP-CK) decarboxy-
lates OAA to PEP in the cytosol. The resulting C
3 acid is 
then transported back to the site of PEPC as PEP in the 
case of PEP-CK-based decarboxylation, or as pyruvate or 
alanine for NAD-ME and NADP-ME. In the chloroplasts, 
pyruvate is recycled to PEP by the action of pyruvate, phos-
phate dikinase (PPDK) with the reaction products pyroph-
osphate and AMP recycled by pyrophosphorylase (PPase) 
and AMP kinase (AMK). Historically, three different meta-
bolic C
4 types were proposed based on the decarboxylation 
enzyme: the NADP-ME type, the NAD-ME type, and the 
PEP-CK type, of which the latter was considered the most 
complex (Hatch, 1987). An NADP-ME C
4-type leaf and an 
NAD-ME C 4-type leaf have been compared with closely 
related C3 species globally at the transcriptome level which 
identified core C 4 cycle components and placed upper lim-
its on the number of genes changed transcriptionally in C 4 
metabolism (Bräutigam et al., 2011; Gowik et al., 2011).
Among the C 4 plants with the highest contribution of 
PEP-CK activity to decarboxylation is the guinea grass 
M. maximus, one of the plant species in which the enzyme 
activity was originally described and therefore a prototypical 
PEP-CK plant (summarized in Hatch, 1987). Megathyrsus 
maximus has been taxonomically regrouped several times 
(Grass Phylogeny Working Group II, 2012), and has also 
been called Panicum maximum and Urochloa maxima. Other 
species with high PEP-CK activity in addition to NAD-ME 
activity are Urochloa panicoides (Ku et al., 1980) and Chloris 
gayana (Hatch, 1987).
The biochemical characterization of PEP-CK-type C
4 plants 
identified carboxylation by PEPC as in all other C 4 plants 
(Ku et al., 1980) and two decarboxylation enzymes, PEP-CK 
and NAD-ME (Ku et al., 1980; Chapman and Hatch, 1983; 
Burnell and Hatch, 1988a, b; Agostino et al., 1996). Exclusive 
decarboxylation by PEP-CK has not been reported to date. 
Carboxylation and decarboxylation are linked by the transfer 
acids malate, aspartate, alanine, pyruvate, and PEP (summa-
rized in Hatch, 1987). In C. gayana, the distribution of trans-
fer acids has been investigated by feeding labelled CO
2; both 
malate and aspartate became rapidly labelled, indicating that 
both are used as transfer acids. Furthermore, the labelling rate 
of aspartate was twice as high as that of malate, indicating an 
approximate flux ratio of 2:1 between aspartate and malate 
(Hatch, 1979). In M. maximus, the aminotransferase enzyme 
activities were localized to the cytosol (Chapman and Hatch, 
1983) and the malate-producing malate dehydrogenases 
(MDHs) were present as both chloroplastidic NADP-MDH 
and cytosolic and mitochondrial NAD-MDH (Chapman and 
Hatch, 1983).
A high rate of PEP-CK decarboxylation is linked to malate 
decarboxylation in the bundle sheath and consumption of the 
resulting reducing equivalents (REs) either by reduction of 
OAA to malate or by the mitochondrial electron transport 
chain (Hatch, 1987; Burnell and Hatch, 1988a, b). The ATP 
produced is exported to the cytosol to fuel the PEP-CK reac-
tion (Hatch et al., 1988). It remains unresolved whether pyru-
vate kinase activity produces pyruvate from PEP (Chapman 
and Hatch, 1983) for transfer back to the mesophyll.
PEP-CK enzyme activity has also been reported for sev-
eral NADP-ME and NAD-ME species: (Walker et al., 1997; 
Wingler et al., 1999; Bräutigam et al., 2011; Pick et al., 2011; 
Sommer et  al., 2012; Christin et  al., 2013; Muhaidat and 
McKown, 2013). Whether PEP-CK is an independent subtype 
or whether it is essentially similar to NAD-ME or NADP-ME 
species remains unresolved. Supplemental PEP-CK activity 
was apparently favoured during the evolution of C
4 plants, 
possibly because it lowers the concentrations and gradients 
of the transfer acids (Wang et al., 2014), but it is unknown 
whether it is beneficial for engineering the trait.
Megathyrsus maximus displays a classical Kranz anatomy 
with large BSCs and few MCs between bundles (Y oshimura 
et  al., 2004). In this arrangement, the cell types are linked 
by plasmodesmata, which allow symplastic transport of the 
transfer acids along the concentration gradient (Evert et al., 
1977; Hatch, 1987; Botha, 1992; Bräutigam and Weber, 
2011). However, this dependence upon symplastic transport 
has been questioned (Sowinski et al., 2008) and the gradients 
measured between the cell types in maize do not quite reach 
the required steepness (Stitt and Heldt, 1985). In M. maxi-
mus, the photosynthetic rate is correlated with growth light 
intensity and with plasmodesmatal density (Sowinski et al., 
2007). The large BSCs have increased organelle number com-
pared with C
3 BSCs and their chloroplasts have fully devel-
oped grana (Y oshimura et  al., 2004). As a consequence of 
linear electron transfer in the bundle sheath chloroplasts, 
oxygen is produced, leading to higher photorespiration 
compared with other C
4 plants (Furbank and Badger, 1982; 
Ohnishi and Kanai, 1983; Farineau et al., 1984). However, the 
quantum yield for M. maximus is comparable with, or above, 
the quantum yield for Zea mays (NADP-ME+PEP-CK) and 
Sorghum bicolor (NADP-ME) (Ehleringer and Pearcy, 1983). 
Neither the intercellular transport rates of transfer acids nor

the global consequences of linear electron transfer in BSCs 
have been explored.
The recent sequencing of the model plant Setaria italica 
(Bennetzen et al., 2012) and the detailed phylogenetic analy-
sis of grasses (Grass Phylogeny Working Group II, 2012) ena-
bles RNA-Seq of the PEP-CK subtype of C
4 photosynthesis, 
by providing a mapping reference and the identification of 
suitable sister species, respectively. Although the phylogeny 
of the Paniceae tribe of grasses is not resolved with complete 
confidence (Grass Phylogeny Working Group II, 2012), the 
C
3 grass Dichanthelium clandestinum and the PEP-CK C 4 
grass M. maximus are currently considered as monophyletic 
lineages that shared the last common ancestor 18 ± 4 Myr 
(million years) ago (Vicentini et  al., 2008; Grass Phylogeny 
Working Group II, 2012). Dichanthelium clandestinum is 
therefore among the closest living sister taxa to the PEP-CK-
type model species M. maximus and was chosen for the com-
parison in the work reported here.
Two complementary strategies were chosen to extend the 
blueprint of C
4 photosynthesis to associated pathways and 
functions beyond the core cycle, which has already been 
described for the NAD-ME plant C.  gynandra (Bräutigam 
et al., 2011): (i) a broad analysis of C
4-related functions using 
comparative RNA-Seq data for PEP-CK (Paniceae, this 
study), NADP-ME (Flaveria species) (Gowik et al., 2011a), 
and NAD-ME (Cleome species) (Bräutigam et  al., 2011), 
and leaf RNA-Seq data sets for Z.  mays (Li et  al., 2011), 
S.  italica (Bennetzen et  al., 2012), S.  bicolor, Oryza sativa, 
and Brachypodium distachyon (Davidson et al., 2012); and (ii) 
a detailed C
3 versus C4 comparison between the PEP-CK spe-
cies M. maximus and its C3 sister species D. clandestinum.
Materials and methods
Plant growth and harvesting
Megathyrsus maximus (Collection of the Botanical Garden 
Düsseldorf) and D. clandestinum (grown from seed obtained from 
B&T World Seeds, Perpignan, France) plants were grown with 16 h 
of light at 24 °C. Dichanthelium clandestinum was maintained vege-
tatively. Harvesting was scheduled to the eight-leaf stage, which was 
3–5 weeks after germination or tiller initiation. In the middle of the 
light period, the third leaf from the top—the third youngest—was 
sampled in three replicates for sequencing (one for 454 and two for 
Illumina sequencing) and five replicates for enzyme activities, and 
quenched in liquid nitrogen immediately after cutting. Pools of 20 
plants per sample were harvested.
Enzyme activities
C
4 decarboxylation enzymes were extracted from frozen, ground 
leaves using 1 ml of buffer [25 mM TRIS-HCl (pH 7.5), 1 mM 
MgSO4, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 0.2 mM phenyl-
methylsulphonyl fluoride (PMSF), and 10% (v/v) glycerol] per 10 mg 
of leaf powder. After desalting using NAP-5 size exclusion columns, 
enzyme activities of PEP-CK (Walker et al., 1995), NAD-ME, and 
NADP-ME (Hatch and Mau, 1977) were measured photometrically 
based on the absorption change of NAD(P)H at 340 nm.
CO2 assimilation rates and isotope discrimination
For three replicates of both species, the net leaf photosynthetic 
assimilation rate (A) was measured using a Li-Cor LI-6400XT 
infrared gas exchange analyser (LI-COR Inc., Lincoln, NE, 
USA). CO
2-dependent assimilation curves (A–C i) were measured 
at 1500  μmol m–2 s –1 constant light. Light-dependent assimilation 
curves were measured at a constant external CO 2 concentration of 
400 ppm.
For 13C isotope discrimination, leaf powder was dried and ana-
lysed using the isotope ratio mass spectrometer IsoPrime 100 
(IsoPrime Ltd, Cheadle, Manchester, UK). Results were expressed 
as relative values compared with the international standard (Vienna-
PeeDee Belemnite).
RNA extraction and sequencing
Isolation of total RNA from ground tissue of M.  maximus was 
performed using a guanidium thiocyanate extraction followed by 
an ethanol and a lithium chloride precipitation, as described by 
Chomczynski and Sacchi (1987). Extraction of total RNA from 
D. clandestinum was performed using a TRIS-borate buffer to cope 
with large amounts of polysaccharides, as described by Westhoff and 
Herrmann (1988). mRNA for 454 library preparation was enriched 
by using Qiagen Oligotex poly(A)-binding silicone beads and fur -
ther prepared for sequencing as described in Weber et al. (2007). For 
Illumina sequencing two replicates of total RNA were used per sam-
ple. Library preparation and sequencing were carried out according 
to the manufacturer’s suggestions by the local NGS facility (BMFZ, 
Biologisch-Medizinisches Forschungszentrum, Düsseldorf), using 
Roche Titanium chemicals for 454 and the TruSeq library kit for 
Illumina HiSeq 2000. Long and short read raw data were submitted 
to the short read archive (SUB440021, D. clandestinum; SUB439950, 
M. maximus).
Sequence assembly and expression statistics
De novo assembly was done using CAP3 (Huang and Madan, 1999) 
using default parameters on cleaned 454 reads. Reads were cleaned 
by trimming low quality ends, discarding reads of overall minor 
quality, and removal of exact duplicates using scripts of the FASTX-
Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/) as described in 
Schliesky et  al. (2012). Contigs were annotated by BLAST best 
hit mapping to S.  italica (v164) representative coding sequences. 
Quantitative expression was determined by mapping of all Illumina 
reads against S. italica representative coding sequences (v164) using 
BLAT (Kent, 2002) and counting the best hit for each read. Zero 
counts were treated as true 0. Expression was normalized to reads 
per mappable million and per kilobase (rpkm) Setaria CDS. Eight 
rpkm were chosen as the threshold of expression to discriminate 
background transcription. Differential expression was determined 
by DESeq (Anders and Huber, 2010), a negative binomial test, in 
R (R Development Core Team, 2012). A significance threshold of 
0.05 was applied after Bonferroni correction for multiple hypothesis 
testing and is reported in Supplementary Table S3 available at JXB 
online. For all single genes mentioned in the text, changes in expres-
sion were confirmed using the 454 data set which was also mapped 
across species to S. italica as described in Bräutigam et al. (2011) 
(Supplementary Table S3). Pathway enrichment was determined by 
Benjamini–Hochberg correction (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). 
Fisher’s exact test was used to test for over-/under-representation of 
MapMan categories.
Meta comparison of functional categories
Expression data for B. dystachyon, S. bicolor, and O. sativa were pre-
viously published by Davidson et  al. (2012). Transcript sequences 
for mature Z. mays leaves (+4 cm sample) were obtained from the 
short read archive SRA012297 (Li et  al., 2010)  and mapped to 
S. italica representative coding sequences. Expression data for five 
Flaveria species were taken from Gowik et  al. (2011). Expression 
data for Cleome gynandra (C
4) and Tarenaya hassleriana (C 3) were 
taken from Bräutigam et al. (2011). The samples were produced in 
3582 | Bräutigam et al.
different laboratories and with different sequencing technologies. 
Only the presence of C 4-related traits was interpreted, as absence 
calls may be due to inconsistent sampling with regard to leaf devel-
opmental state, time of day, and other variables.
EC (enzyme classifiers; Schomburg et al., 2013) and Pfam (pro-
tein family; Sonnhammer et al., 1997) annotations were added to the 
two reference transcriptomes, S. italica CDS (v164) and Arabidopsis 
thaliana CDS (TAIR10). Reduction of data complexity to func-
tional classifiers was achieved by summing up all expression values 
mapping to the same EC or Pfam. Venn diagram sets were built 
through logical operators; that is, expression is higher/lower in all 
C
4 versus C3 comparisons (see also Supplementary Table S2 at JXB 
online). Comparison pairs were chosen according to the sequenc-
ing method and experimenter: M. maximus versus D. clandestinum 
(this study), S. bicolor versus O. sativa and versus B. dystachyon (all 
from Davidson et al. 2012); Z. mays (Li et al. 2011) and S. italica 
(Bennetzen et  al. 2012) were orphan data sets as no comparison 
partner was sequenced with the same technology and both were 
compared against B. dystachion as the C
3 reference. The dicots were 
compared as previously published (Bräutigam et  al. 2011; Gowik 
et al., 2011).
Leaf cross-sections for confocal microscopy
Fresh mature leaves (upper third of the leaf) of M.  maximus and 
D. clandestinum were cut transversally and fixed in PBST [1× PBS 
buffer (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 4.3 mM Na
2HPO4, 1.4 mM 
KH2PO4); 1% (v/v) Tween-20; 3% (v/v) glutaraldehyde] overnight 
at room temperature. Leaf cross-sections were stained with 0.1% 
4’,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) solution in phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS) for 30 min. Subsequently, cross-sections were 
analysed with an LSM 780 (Zeiss) confocal microscope with a ×40 
objective. Z-stack images were processed with LSM Zeiss software 
to produce maximum intensity overlay images.
Results
D. clandestinum is well suited for a C3 comparison with 
M. maximus
The PACMAD clade of the grasses is exceptionally rich in 
C4 plants (Christin et al., 2013) to the point that it is difficult 
to identify and cultivate closely related C 3 species for com-
parative analyses. To confirm that D. clandestinum is a bona 
fide C
3 plant and to confirm the biochemical subtype of the 
C4 plant M. maximus, different parameters were tested. The 
measured enzyme activities, stable isotopic carbon discrimi-
nation, A–C
i curves, and light curves indicated that D. clan-
destinum indeed represents a C 3 plant (Fig. 1). Megathyrsus 
maximus has high NAD-ME and PEP-CK enzyme activities 
as compared with D.  clandestinum, but comparable activi-
ties of the NADP-ME decarboxylation enzyme (Fig.  1A).

relaxation of carbon isotope discrimination with a δ13C ratio 
of –13‰ (Fig. 1B). The A –Ci curve of M. maximus shows a 
low CO2 compensation point of 9 ppm and saturation of the 
net carbon fixation rate at 41  μmol m–2 s–1. The A –Ci curve 
of D. clandestinum plants grown alongside M. maximus indi-
cates a CO 2 compensation point of 65 ppm and does not 
saturate even with high CO 2 concentrations, as is typical for 
a C3 plant (Fig. 1C). The light response curves of CO2 assim-
ilation show similar rates for both types of plants at very 
low light intensities, with M. maximus continuously outgain-
ing D. clandestinum as light increases. Thus, M. maximus has 
slightly higher quantum efficiency and saturates at a higher 
light intensity compared with D. clandestinum ( Fig. 1D). In 
summary, the physiological data indicate that D.  clandesti-
num is a suitable comparison partner for M. maximus due to 
its phylogenetic proximity and physiological characteristics 
typical of C
3 plants.
Quantitative and qualitative transcriptome information
The transcriptomes of both grass species were determined 
by RNA-Seq using two complementary technologies to 
gain quantitative gene expression information and provide 
a sequence resource optimized for C
4 unigene assembly. 
RNA-Seq libraries from two biological replicates of M. max-
imus and two biological replicates of D.  clandestinum were 
sequenced with Illumina HiSeq2000 technology and yielded 
upwards of 53 million reads per replicate, of which >48 mil-
lion reads were of high quality (Table 1). Reads were mapped 
cross-species to a closely related reference sequence database 
derived from the S. italica genome (Bennetzen et al., 2012) 
and between 66% and 74% of reads matched the reference 
sequence database (Table 1). In the reference sequence data-
base, 13 043 genes were matched with >8 rpkm, of which 792 
were detected as differentially up-regulated in C
4 and 376 
were detected as differentially down-regulated in C4 (Table 1). 
In addition, 1.1 million and 0.9 million 454/Roche Titanium 
reads were generated and assembled for M.  maximus and 
D. clandestinum, respectively, and mapped onto S. italica as 
a quality control for the Illumina mapping. The majority of 
gene expression differences followed similar trends in the 454 
mapping or were not detected among the 454 reads; only 12 
genes displayed inversely regulated patterns with the differ -
ent sequencing technologies. Reads were filtered and trimmed 
based on a Phred score of 30 and assembled with CAP3 
(Huang and Madan, 1999) to provide a reliable database of 
unigenes. C
4 cycle genes were covered by unigenes with full 
length (Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online). About 40 
000 unigenes were generated for each species (Table 1).
Genes commonly up- or down-regulated in all C4 
decarboxylation types
Comparative RNA-Seq data for NADP-ME species versus C3 
sister species (Gowik et al., 2011) and for NAD-ME species 
versus C3 sister species (Bräutigam et al., 2011), three RNA-
Seq data sets for S. bicolor, O. sativa, and B. dystachyon from 
one comparative experiment (Davidson et al., 2012), as well 
as orphan RNA-Seq data sets for two PACMAD NADP-ME 
grasses, Z. mays (Li et al., 2011) and S. italica (Li et al., 2011), 
are publicly available. By combining the public data with data 
from this study, the up- and down-regulated core C
4 genes 
altered in all C4 species were identified.
Gene by gene comparisons may be limited between dif-
ferent C 3–C4 species comparison pairs since for known C 4 
genes, most notably PEPC, recruitment of paralogous genes 
has already been demonstrated (Westhoff and Gowik, 2004; 
Besnard et  al., 2009; Christin and Besnard, 2009). In addi-
tion, a function may be distributed among multiple genes, 
each of which singly does not appear changed. To over -
come the inherent limitations of orthologous gene pair com-
parisons when analysing multiple species pairs, reads were 
summed to categories which represent a function rather 
than a particular gene. Enzymes were identified in the ref-
erence species A. thaliana and S. italica on the basis of EC 
numbers which cover ~5000 different enzymes (Schomburg 
et al., 2013), of which 1073 are present in the references, and 
reads for each gene were summed based on the EC number. 
For example, reads mapping to different isogenes encoding 
PEPC are no longer represented by the gene identifier but 
they have been collapsed onto the EC number representing 
PEPC function (4.1.1.31). All proteins in both reference spe-
cies were also assigned to their protein family on the basis 
of Pfam domains (Sonnhammer et al., 1997), of which 4073 
unique combinations are present in the references, and reads 
for each gene were summed based on the Pfam domain com-
bination. Consequently, PEPC is no longer represented by 
a gene identifier but its function is represented by its Pfam 
domain combination pf00311. The functions up-regulated or 
down-regulated in all C

C3 species and those limited to the two NAD-ME type based 
species were then analysed (Fig. 2A–D; Supplementary Table 
S2 at JXB online).
The functional analysis based on EC numbers indicated a 
consistent up-regulation of 16 functions in all C4 comparisons. 
The C4 enzymes with PPDK, PPase, AMK, PEPC, aspartate 
aminotransferase (AspAT), NADP-dependent malate dehy-
drogenase (NADP-MDH), and ME are up-regulated in all 
comparisons (Fig. 2A). In addition, one function related to 
starch synthesis, two functions related to sucrose synthe-
sis, and six functions currently unlinked to C
4 were identi-
fied (Fig. 2A; Supplementary Table S2 at JXB online). Both 
NAD-ME species have 135 up-regulated functions in com-
mon, including PEP-CK, alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT), 
pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) kinase, and nine enzymes 
involved in purine synthesis and turnover (Fig.  2A). The 
37 functions down-regulated in all C
4 comparisons include 
four of the Calvin–Benson (CBB) cycle and eight related to 
photorespiration (Fig. 2B). The down-regulated functions in 
both NAD-ME-type comparisons included aspartate kinase 
and aspartate oxidase, eight functions of pyrimidine synthe-
sis, four of the CBB cycle, 11 of chlorophyll synthesis, and 16 
of translation (Fig. 2B).
The functional analysis based on Pfam domain combi-
nations showed 34 up-regulated functions in all C
4 species 
including PEPC, PPDK, phosphoenolpyruvate phosphate 
translocator (PPT), and ME. Four photosystem-related 
functions, two functions related to starch synthesis, and one 
related to sucrose synthesis are also among those up-regu-
lated (Fig. 2C). The 413 NAD-ME-type related up-regulated 
functions include PEP-CK, the pyruvate transporter (BASS2, 
Furumoto et al., 2011), and the sodium:hydrogen antiporter 
(NHD; Furumoto et  al., 2011), all detected with high fold 
changes (Fig.  2C; Supplementary Table S2 at JXB online). 
Among the 38 down-regulated functions are the CBB cycle, 
photorespiration, and translation (Fig. 2D).
The analyses of C
4-related functions extend the known 
C4 up-regulated traits to sucrose and starch synthesis and 
the C4 down-regulated traits to the CBB cycle, photorespira-
tory functions, and translation. They also provide candidates 
for as yet unknown functions which may be C
4 related. The 
NAD-ME-type related functions include those that prevent 
the leakage of C
4 cycle metabolites into general metabolism.
The PEP-CK decarboxylation subtype is qualitatively 
similar to but quantitatively distinct from the NAD-ME
Given the blueprint of NAD-ME C 4 photosynthesis 
(Bräutigam et al., 2011), it was tested whether the differen-
tially regulated functions in the PEP-CK species are those 
already identified for the NAD-ME species. The occur -
rence of PEP-CK activity in species previously classified as 
NADP-ME and NAD-ME species and recent modelling 
efforts raised the question of whether the classification of 
PEP-CK as its own C
4 type is warranted (Wang et al., 2014).
The C 4 genes were extracted from the complete data set 
(Supplementary Table S3 at JXB online) and compared with 
those of C. gynandra (Bräutigam et al., 2011). Megathyrsus 
maximus and C.  gynandra show elevated expression of 
enzymes and transporters known to be required for C
4 pho-
tosynthesis (Table 2). Megathyrsus maximus showed signifi-
cantly increased transcripts encoding BASS2, NHD, PPDK, 
and PPT, which is similar to the dicotyledonous NAD-ME C
4 
species C. gynandra. In comparison with a C 3 reference, the 
up-regulation of these transcripts was between 27-fold and 
67.5-fold in M. maximus and between 15-fold and 226-fold

in C.  gynandra. PPDK induction, however, was lower in 
M. maximus compared with C. gynandra, which might indi-
cate increased regeneration of PEP by PEP-CK rather than 
PPDK. Both species also showed changes in AMK and PPase 
expression, but these were not expressed to a significantly 
higher extent in M. maximus. The NHD and AMK expressed 
at high levels are paralogous to the same proteins required 
for the C
4 cycle in the dicotyledonous plant (Table  2). The 
carboxylation enzyme PEPC was significantly up-regulated 
in both the dicot and the monocot, again using paralogues 
(Table 2). For the generation of the C
4 transfer acids malate 
and aspartate, only cytosolic AspAT was significantly up-reg-
ulated in M. maximus, while no up-regulation of the cytosolic 
isozyme was observed in C. gynandra. Cytosolic targeting was 
determined by localization prediction of the full-length pro-
tein of M. maximus (Supplementary Table S4 at JXB online). 
The most abundant transcript encoding MDH also encoded 
a cytosolic isozyme, suggesting use of the NAD-MDH form 
(Supplementary Table S4).
Two different decarboxylation modules using NAD-ME 
and PEP-CK, respectively, are active in the plants (Fig. 1A). 
In M. maximus, neither the transport protein DIC, respon-
sible for antiport of malate into mitochondria against 
phosphate (Palmieri et al., 2008), and PIC, responsible for 
symport of phosphate and protons (Pratt et al., 1991; Hamel 
et  al., 2004), nor the decarboxylation enzyme NAD-ME 
were significantly changed, although all were up-regulated 
between 2.3- and 5.6-fold (Table 2). This is in stark contrast 
to the up-regulation detected for DIC and NAD-ME in 
C. gynandra which was between 20-and 519-fold. No can-
didate for pyruvate export from the mitochondria could be 
identified. The situation is reversed for the PEP-CK mod-
ule where PEP-CK was significantly up-regulated 90-fold 
in M.  maximus but only 8.6-fold in C.  gynandra. The 
mitochondrial ATP-ADP translocase, AAC (Haferkamp 
et  al., 2002), is up-regulated in M.  maximus, but not to a 
significant degree (Table  2). Orthologous AlaATs are sig-
nificantly up-regulated by 37-fold in both species. Unlike 
the C. gynandra protein, which is predicted to be targeted 
to mitochondria, the M.  maximus protein is predicted to 
be cytosolic (Supplementary Table S4 at JXB online). The 
M. maximus AlaAT protein showed a shortened N-terminus 
when aligned to the S.  italica gene (Supplementary Table 
S4), hence in silico targeting predicted cytosolic localization. 
Finally, non-significant up-regulation of TPT and plastidic 
GAP-DH was detected in M. maximus to comparable levels 
as in C. gynandra ( Table 2).
In addition to single gene analysis, differentially regulated 
genes were subjected to pathway enrichment analysis to detect 
changes in gene expression for whole pathways such as the 
CBB cycle, photorespiration, and photosynthesis. None of the 
pathways was significantly enriched among the differentially 
regulated genes (Supplementary Table S5 at JXB online).
The gene-by-gene and enrichment analyses revealed a simi-
lar but not identical blueprint for the PEP-CK species com-
pared with the NAD-ME species. The core cycle blueprint was 
amended to include a companion transporter for the malate 
phosphate antiporter DIC, which couples it to the proton gra-
dient with phosphate proton symport through PIC.
Energy requirements derived from the PEP-CK 
blueprint
The energy requirements of intracellular transport reactions 
were not considered when the energy balance of C 4 photo-
synthesis was originally calculated (i.e. Kanai and Edwards, 
1999), although pyruvate transport was hypothesized to be 
active based on measurements of the metabolite concentra-
tion gradients in maize (Stitt and Heldt, 1985). To assess

Integrative C4 model | 3587
amended blueprint was translated into a model of PEP-CK 
C4 photosynthesis (Fig. 3).
Energy requirements are calculated following one turn of 
the cycle (Fig. 3): after PEP is carboxylated to OAA, half of 
the OAA is reduced to malate (Hatch et  al., 1988), requir-
ing on average 0.5 REs derived from photosynthesis for each 
CO
2 (Fig. 3). The remaining OAA is transported as aspartate 
(Fig. 3). At the bundle sheath mitochondria, malate exchange 
for phosphate via DIC is coupled to the proton gradient via 
phosphate proton symport by PIC (Fig. 3). This process con-
sumes the proton gradient of mitochondria. The proton gra-
dient is also used to drive mitochondrial ATP synthesis for the 
PEP-CK reaction which decarboxylates OAA to PEP (Fig. 3) 
and is regenerated by oxidizing the NADH produced by 
malate decarboxylation (Fig. 3). The carboxylation, transfer, 
and decarboxylation thus consume on average 0.5 NADPH 
per CO
2 generated in photosynthetic electron transfer. During 
regeneration, the PPDK reactions require 2 ATP for the 
regeneration of each pyruvate but, since only half of the flux 
runs through malate decarboxylation and therefore pyruvate, 
only 1 ATP is required for each CO
2. The PPDK reaction is 
driven towards PEP regeneration by the PPase, which splits 
the energy-rich bond of pyrophosphate and makes the PPDK 
reaction irreversible in vivo. The production of PEP and its 
export through PPT creates the proton gradient required 
to import pyruvate and cycle sodium through the transport 
system (Fig.  3). Although the active transport of pyruvate 
is driven by the proton gradient, it requires no additional 
input of energy beyond that expended for the PPDK reaction 
(Furumoto et al., 2011). The regeneration phase thus requires 
1 ATP in total. The CBB cycle requires 3 ATP and 2 REs from 
photosynthesis, which may be consumed in the bundle sheath 
or mesophyll.
The total PEP-CK-based C
4 cycle, assuming no overcycling, 
thus requires 4 ATP and 2.5 NADPH from the photosynthetic 
electron transfer chain while solely NADP-ME-based C
4 pho-
tosynthesis requires 5 ATP and 2 NADPH and C3 photosyn-
thesis requires 3 ATP and 2 NADPH for each CO 2 ( Kanai 
and Edwards, 1999). Engineering a PEP-CK-type C4 cycle will 
thus avoid the adjustments required for the photosynthetic 
electron transfer chain since the demands in terms of the ATP 
and NADPH ratio are almost the same as in C
3 plants.
Intercellular transport derived from the PEP-CK 
blueprint
Engineering a C4 cycle may require modifications to the sym-
plastic transport interface (Weber and Bräutigam, 2013). To 
estimate the difference in intercellular transport for each MC, 
intercellular transport events between C
4 and C 3 were com-
pared. Data from the scheme depicted in Fig.  3 were com-
bined with anatomical data (Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB 
online) and photosynthetic rates (Fig. 1C).
Since transport events are assessed per MC and not per 
leaf area, the number of MCs per leaf area was determined. 
In the C
4 plants, photosynthesis requires the MC and its adja-
cent BSC; in the C 3 plant, each MC is a self-contained unit. 
Microscopic imaging of leaf cross-sections revealed typical 
Kranz anatomy in M.  maximus with large BSCs, each of 
which was connected to multiple MCs (Supplementary Fig. 
S1 at JXB online). The density of MCs was almost twice 
as high in the C
3 leaf compared with the C 4 leaf (Table 3). 
Since the photosynthetic rate per leaf area is also higher in 
M. maximus (Fig. 1C), almost twice as much CO
2 is fixed in 
each MC–BSC pair in M. maximus compared with an MC 
of D. clandestinum (5.4 versus 2.6 pmol CO
2 per unit and sec-
ond). In D. clandestinum, only sucrose transport is required 
across the MC wall. Since each sucrose molecule carries 12 
carbons, and since only half of the carbon is exported at any 
given time, with the remainder stored as starch, the assimi-
lation of one molecule of CO
2 requires 1/12 × 1/2=0.042 
transport events in the C 3 plant (Table  3). In contrast, the 
PEP-CK-based C4 cycle requires between 2.75 and 4.75 trans-
port events depending on the extent of RE shuttling because 
the C
4 acids, the C3 acids, balancing phosphates, and REs are 
transported (Table 3). The total number of transport events 
is estimated by multiplying the number of CO
2 molecules 
assimilated with the number of transport events required for 
each CO
2 as 11.6–20.1 pmol s–1 in the C4 species while for C3 
it is 0.1 pmol s–1. C4 photosynthesis requires between 100- and 
Table 3. Parameters for the calculation of transport requirements for the PEP-CK/NAD-ME C4 cycle show that C4 photosynthesis 
requires 100–200 times more transport events
Cell density was estimated from Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online and divided by photosynthetic parameters derived from Fig. 1 to yield the 
photosynthetic rate per cell (A). C4 cycle transport requirements were derived from Fig. 3 and summed to calculate total transport events (B). 
Total transport events through plasmodesmata are calculated as A×B.

200-fold more transport events than C3 photosynthesis, such 
that the intercellular transport capacity needs to be increased 
by approximately two orders of magnitude in C4 (Table 3).
Engineering of the C 4 cycle will thus almost certainly 
require engineering of the BSC–MC interface, as it is highly 
unlikely that an existing C
3 MC could support the >100-fold 
increased symplastic flux.
Discussion
Assembly and mapping characteristics
This study was designed to compare two closely related C 3 
and C 4 species to increase the probability of detecting C 4-
related rather than species-related differences. While for 
several C
3 grass species, such as rice and Brachypodium, the 
genomes have already been sequenced and thus could serve 
as C
3 reference for comparative transcriptome sequencing, 
all of these belong to the BEP clade and have thus diverged 
45–55 Myr ago from M. maximus (Grass Phylogeny Working 
Group II, 2012), which belongs to the PACMAD clade. 
Dichanthelium clandestinum was chosen as a C
3 species from 
within the PACMAD clade for the transcriptomic compari-
son presented here. Although the precise phylogenetic posi-
tion of the Dichanthelium clade of Paniceae, which includes 
D.  clandestinum, has not been determined, it was recently 
placed as sister to the group, which contains M.  maximus 
(Grass Phylogeny Working Group II, 2012), with a diver -
gence time of 14–22 Myr ago (Vicentini et  al., 2008). For 
quantification of steady-state transcript amounts, the RNA-
Seq reads were mapped onto the coding sequences predicted 
from the Setaria genome. The closer phylogenetic proxim-
ity of M. maximus to Setaria is represented in the slightly 
higher mapping efficiency of its reads (Table  1). Overall, 
the mapping efficiency is above that of the Flaveria species 
on Arabidopsis (Gowik et al., 2011a ) but below that of the 
Cleomaceae on Arabidopsis ( Bräutigam et  al., 2011). The 
disadvantage of a slightly uneven mapping efficiency was, 
however, outweighed by mapping reads from both species 
onto a common genome-based reference sequence, which 
enabled normalization to reads per kilobase per million 
reads. In addition, low abundance transcripts are frequently 
under-represented in contig assemblies, while high abun-
dance transcripts were fragmented into multiple contigs per 
transcript. Establishing orthology, while possible with tools 
such as OrthoMCL, requires assumptions about similarities. 
Mapping onto a reference database as previously success-
fully established (Bräutigam et al., 2011, Gowik et al., 2011) 
was chosen to overcome this problem.
Contig assembly from Illumina reads results in fragmented 
contigs, especially for the high abundance contigs, as observed 
previously in other RNA-Seq projects (Bräutigam and Gowik, 
2010; Franssen et  al., 2011; Schliesky et  al., 2012). The C
4 
transcripts are among the most highly expressed transcripts 
in leaves of C
4 plants (Bräutigam et  al., 2011). To produce 
high confidence contigs, the transcriptome was sequenced by 
a long read technology, the reads cleaned with a high base 
quality threshold of Phred=30, and assembled with CAP3. 
Within the database, full-length contigs for all candidate C
4 
genes were identified (Supplementary Tables S1, S4 at JXB 
online), validating a hybrid approach to quantification and 
database generation (Bräutigam and Gowik, 2010).
Are NAD-ME and the PEP-CK distinct subtypes of C4 
photosynthesis?
The three classical subtypes of C4 photosynthesis, NADP-ME, 
NAD-ME, and PEP-CK, have been analysed by comparative 
transcriptome sequencing (Bräutigam et  al., 2011; Gowik 
et al., 2011; this study). If the two C
4 types NAD-ME and 
PEP-CK which both rely wholly or partially on NAD-ME-
based decarboxylation were fundamentally different, major 
differences in the transcriptional profile would be expected. 
However, quantification of transcript abundance showed that 
the functions up-regulated in the NAD-ME plant C. gynan-
dra, which shows some PEP-CK activity (Sommer et  al., 
2012), and the PEP-CK plant M.  maximus, which displays 
high PEP-CK activity, are quite similar.
The bicarbonate acceptor regeneration module is essen-
tially identical. Both plant species belong to the sodium 
pyruvate transport group, as defined by Aoki et  al. (1992), 
and show joint up-regulation of not only the sodium pyru-
vate symporter BASS2 (Furumoto et  al., 2011), but also 
the companion sodium:hydrogen antiporter NHD, and the 
PEP phosphate antiporter PPT (Bräutigam et  al., 2011; 
Gowik et al., 2011; Table 2). The generation of the transfer 
acids appears to be cytosolic as neither of the two plastidial 
dicarboxylate transporters, DiT1 (OAA/malate antiporter) 
(Weber et al., 1995; Kinoshita et al., 2011) and DiT2 (OAA/
aspartate antiporter) (Renne et al., 2003), was up-regulated 
(Supplementary Table S3 at JXB online) and the most abun-
dant contigs encoding AspAT and MDH were predicted to 
be cytosolic (Table 2; Supplementary Table S4). The cytosolic 
localization relaxes the need to up-regulate organellar trans-
porters, which are required to import substrates and export 
products. The two species use differentially localized AspATs, 
a mitochondrial isozyme in the case of C. gynandra (Sommer 
et al., 2012) and a cytosolic one in the case of M. maximus 
(Table  2; Toledo-Silva et  al., 2013). For the decarboxyla-
tion process, both species use a combination of PEP-CK 
and NAD-ME and consequently have the same functions 
up-regulated. The degree of up-regulation, however, mirrors 
the enzyme activity differences, with PEP-CK transcripts 
being much more induced in M. maximus and NAD-ME and 
associated transporters much more induced in C.  gynandra 
(Table 2). Hence the difference in decarboxylation biochem-
istry between both species rests in an altered balance between 
NAD-ME and PEP-CK activities, while the overall pathway 
is very similar.
At least part of the C
3 acid transport is accomplished 
through alanine to balance the amino groups between MCs 
and BSCs. The up-regulated AlaAT for both plants is an 
orthologous pair, which is targeted to organelles in C. gynan-
dra (Bräutigam et al., 2011; Sommer et al., 2012) and S. italica 
(Supplementary Table S4 at JXB online). However, enzyme 
activity measurements placed high AlaAT activity in the 
Integrative C4 model | 3589
cytosol of M. maximus (Chapman and Hatch, 1983). The in 
silico translation of the M. maximus transcript revealed that 
it encodes a truncated version of AlaAT in comparison with 
the Setaria gene, in which a potential start ATG in-frame 
with the coding sequence is prefaced by a stop codon. The 
shortened protein is predicted to be cytosolic (Supplementary 
Table S4). Hence, the cytosolic AlaAT activity in M. maxi-
mus appears to have evolved by loss of the target peptide of 
an originally organellar-targeted protein. The simpler cycle 
suggests that the M. maximus blueprint is easier to engineer 
compared with the blueprints of NAD-ME (Bräutigam et al., 
2011; Sommer et al., 2012) and NADP-ME species (Gowik 
et al., 2011; Pick et al., 2011; Denton et al., 2013; Weber and 
Bräutigam, 2013).
Multiple species which had previously been grouped 
as NADP-ME or NAD-ME plants have different degrees 
of PEP-CK activity (Walker et  al., 1997; Pick et  al., 2011; 
Sommer et  al., 2012; Muhaidat and McKown, 2013) and 
modelling shows the advantages of supplemental PEP-CK 
activity in conferring environmental robustness to the path-
way (Wang et al., 2014), raising the question as to whether 
PEP-CK-type plants deserve their own group. While the 
functions up-regulated in C. gynandra and M. maximus are 
similar, there are differences with regard to localization of the 
enzymes generating the transfer acids. Whether the different 
enzyme localizations are tightly associated with the type and 
degree of use of the decarboxylation enzymes remains to be 
determined once additional transcriptomes are sequenced 
and a global view is enabled on more than just one proto-
typical species for each historical C
4 type. For engineering, it 
is probably advisable to follow the blueprint of a particular 
species since it is currently not clear whether differences in 
transfer acid generation are only species specific or are tied to 
other processes such as decarboxylation enzymes and there-
fore functionally relevant.
An extended model of C4 photosynthesis with high 
PEP-CK activity
Understanding the evolution of C 4 metabolism and re-
engineering a C 4 cycle in a C 3 plant requires a mechanistic 
understanding of the parts making up the system (Denton 
et al., 2013). The global transcriptomics analysis of M. maxi-
mus compared with D.  clandestinum enabled the extension 
of the C
4 metabolism model presented earlier for M. maxi-
mus (Hatch, 1987) and C. gynandra (Bräutigam et al., 2011; 
Sommer et al., 2012).
Transport processes and core cycle
The M. maximus analysis confirmed DIC as the mitochon-
drial malate importer (Table 2; Bräutigam et al., 2011). The 
companion transporter, which couples malate transport to 
the proton gradient of the mitochondria and supplies mito-
chondria with inorganic phosphate for ATP production, is 
probably PIC (Hamel et al., 2004; Table 2; Fig. 3). The only 
transporter which remains unknown at the molecular level 
is the mitochondrial pyruvate exporter. The candidate pyru-
vate transport protein, the human mitochondrial pyruvate 
carrier (MPC) (Bricker et  al., 2012; Herzig et  al., 2012), is 
not differentially expressed in C. gynandra and M. maximus. 
Potentially, pyruvate can traverse biomembranes in its pro-
tonated form by simple diffusion (Benning, 1986), although 
this is unlikely in a cellular context given that only one out of 
10
5 molecules of pyruvic acid occurs in the protonated form 
at physiological pH values. Although early models did not 
take a reducing equivalent shuttle across both chloroplast 
envelopes into account for PEP-CK species (Hatch, 1987), 
possibly because M. maximus lacks chloroplast dimorphism 
(Y oshimura et  al., 2004), measurements of enzyme activity 
confirmed glyceraldehyde dehydrogenase in both MCs and 
BSCs of U. panicoides (Ku and Edwards, 1975), and RNA-
Seq indicated modest up-regulation of the necessary trans-
porters and enzymes (Table  2). Engineering a C
4 cycle will 
critically depend on correctly enabling the transport of sub-
strates through transporters and companion transporters 
(Weber and von Caemmerer, 2010; Fig. 3). Balancing reduc-
ing power between MCs and BSCs via triose-phosphate/
phosphate translocators in chloroplasts in both MCs and 
BSCs appears also to be required in species which lack chlo-
roplast dimorphism (Table 2; Y oshimura et al., 2004).
Knowledge about the intracellular transport proteins 
involved in C
4 photosynthesis has recently improved sig-
nificantly (compare with Weber and von Caemmerer, 2010; 
Bräutigam and Weber, 2011; Denton et al., 2013; Weber and 
Bräutigam, 2013), largely due to RNA-Seq-enabled identifi-
cation and characterization of the chloroplast pyruvate trans-
porter (Furumoto et al., 2011), and the placement of several 
known transport proteins in the C
4 pathway (Taniguchi et al., 
2003; Bräutigam et al., 2011; Gowik et al., 2011a; Kinoshita 
et  al., 2011). However, information about the intercellular 
transport has not progressed since the discovery of sieve 
element-like plasmodesmata plates in the MC–BSC interface 
(Evert et al., 1977; Botha, 1992).
The difference in total transport events between the C
3 and 
the C4 species was estimated using the data provided by the 
model shown in Fig. 3, by images of the cellular architecture 
(Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online), and by photosyn-
thetic rate measurements (Fig. 1C). The large difference in the 
requirement for intracellular transport between C
4 and C3 path-
ways is not predominantly driven by the rather small differences 
in photosynthetic rates (Fig. 1C), but by two other factors: the 
number of MCs per leaf area and the number of transport 
events required for each CO
2 assimilated. The large BSCs, each 
of which borders several MCs, and the fact that M. maximus 
requires two cells in each photosynthetic unit means that the C3 
grass has almost twice as many photosynthetic units in the same 
leaf area. The net CO
2 assimilation capacity is thus not only 
higher by the ~20% higher photosynthetic rate per leaf area 
but—if normalized to the number of MCs—is almost twice as 
high for each unit. The second factor is the number of transport 
processes occurring over each interface. Intercellular transport 
for each C
3 cell is very low, 0.042 events per CO2 assimilated for 
an MC. The transport events for the C4 cycle are more difficult 
to estimate since, in addition to the comparatively fixed flux of 
C
4 and C3 acids in the cycle, the PEP-balancing phosphate flux 
and the RE shuttle yield variable fluxes. However, even using 
3590 | Bräutigam et al.
the lowest possible estimates, a >100-fold difference in trans-
port events is predicted between the C4 and C3 plant interfaces. 
The interface itself is probably optimized for a balance of open-
ness to enable the flux and closed-ness to enrich the CO
2 at the 
site of Rubisco, since different light intensities correlate with 
photosynthetic rates and plasmodesmatal density in M. maxi-
mus (Sowinski et al., 2007). The fold change in transport events 
across the interface is in the range of the fold change expression 
changes for the C
4 genes (Tables 2, 23). The evolution and hence 
also re-engineering of the C4 cycle must adapt the intercellular 
interface.
Accessory pathways to the core cycle
It is tempting to limit engineering efforts to the major tran-
scriptional changes and therefore to the core cycle. However, 
accessory pathways to the core C
4 cycle may play a major role 
in adapting the underlying metabolism to the presence of the 
carbon-concentrating pump.
The comparison of multiple different C
3–C4 pairs and 
therefore C4 origins with each other provides a method to 
identify differentially regulated functions with biological 
significance, once the problem of paralogous genes carrying 
out the functions is overcome. By mapping RNA-Seq data 
to EC numbers and Pfam domains rather than individual 
genes, it has been possible to identify core C
4 genes (Fig. 2; 
Supplementary Table S2 at JXB online), which indicates that 
these methods are suitable to pick up additional C
4-related 
functions.
Both methods picked up functions involved in starch metab-
olism and sucrose synthesis (Fig.  2A, C). In the EC-based 
mapping, the sucrose synthesis pathway was present with 
two functions, the UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase and the 
sucrose-phosphate synthase. Sucrose-phosphate synthase is 
the rate-limiting enzyme for sucrose synthesis in the C
3 plant 
A. thaliana (Häusler et al., 2000; Strand et al., 2000; Koch, 
2004) and NDP sugar pyrophosphorylases are compara-
tively slow enzymes. The surplus of fixed carbon (Fig. 1C, D) 
leads to a surplus of triose-phosphates. In Z. mays, Panicum 
miliaceum, and Brachiaria erucaeformis, sucrose synthesis is 
localized to the mesophyll (Usuda and Edwards, 1980), which 
may also be the case in M. maximus. Both the localization of 
sucrose synthesis and the higher carbon assimilation rate con-
tribute to more triose-phosphate at the site of sucrose syn-
thesis and hence the need for greater sequestration (Fig. 3). 
Similarly, the higher rate of CO
2 assimilation (Fig. 2) and the 
localization of starch storage in the BSCs (Majeran and van 
Wijk, 2009; Majeran et al., 2010) probably also require higher 
rates of starch synthesis to sequester the triose-phosphates 
efficiently (Figs 2, 3). When considering the engineering of 
C
4 photosynthesis, the sequestration of triose-phosphates is 
probably of low priority compared with the engineering of 
the enzymes and transport proteins, yet not adding these 
functions for triose-phosphate sequestration will probably 
limit the system to the capacity of C
3 photosynthetic plants, a 
20% loss of potential productivity.
Insulating the C 4 cycle from other metabolic networks is 
also probably critical to avoid loss of cycle intermediates. No 
obvious proteins with functions in this context were identified 
in comparisons across all C
4 data sets (Fig. 2; Supplementary 
Table S2 at JXB online), although the uncharacterized func-
tions may include such insulators (Supplementary Table S2). 
The analysis of only NAD-ME-based C
4 photosynthesis 
registered changes, which represent the overlap between the 
dicot C.  gynandra and the grass M.  maximus. Both species 
produce pyruvate in their mitochondria (Table 2; Bräutigam 
et al., 2011) and use aspartate as a dominant transfer acid. 
Both NAD-ME species show higher PDH kinase and reduced 
aspartate kinase and aspartate oxidase transcript amounts 
(Fig. 2). These three enzymes control metabolite exit from the 
C
4 cycle as PDH kinase gates pyruvate decarboxylation for 
entry into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, aspartate kinase 
controls entry into aspartate-derived amino acid metabolism, 
and aspartate oxidase controls entry into NAD synthesis. The 
leaking of cycle intermediates into other metabolism despite 
the insulation can be indirectly seen in the labelling pattern 
obtained by
 14CO2 feeding. If metabolites from the cycle are 
consumed, they need to be replaced from the CBB cycle and 
will thus carry label in C
2–C4 of the four-carbon compounds 
and lead to label in the three-carbon compounds, which—
if only cycling—should show no label at all. Indeed, label-
ling studies identified delayed labelling in both groups (e.g. 
Hatch, 1979), indicating that leaking of intermediates does 
occur. When engineering a C
4 cycle into a C 3 plant, limiting 
the leakage of cycle intermediates is probably required for all 
cycle metabolites to keep the cycle running robustly.
Two to three pathways are commonly down-regulated: the 
CBB cycle, photorespiration, and protein synthesis (Fig. 2). 
Reduced expression of these functions in C
4 species may 
not be required to engineer efficient CO 2 capture. However, 
reduced expression of CBB, photorespiration, and protein 
translation (Fig. 2) may be necessary to realize the nitrogen-
saving benefits of C
4 photosynthesis which are common to C4 
plants (Sage, 2004).
NAD-ME species show an unusual pattern with regard to 
nucleotide metabolism; several functions of purine metabo-
lism are up-regulated while several functions of pyrimidine 
synthesis are down-regulated. While one may speculate that 
the changes in purine metabolism are due to the altered ATP 
usage in these plants, the functional reason for these changes 
remains unknown.
Previous global transcriptome analyses found that genes 
encoding components of photosynthetic cyclic electron flow 
(CEF) were significantly up-regulated (Bräutigam et al., 2011; 
Gowik et  al., 2011), raising the question of whether such 
alterations to photosynthesis are required in all C
4 subtypes. 
The present analysis did not indicate differences in CEF in 
M. maximus compared with D. clandestinum (Supplementary 
Table S5 at JXB online). The reason lies in the high PEP-CK 
activity, which is fuelled by malate oxidation in mitochondria 
(Fig. 3). Malate is generated using photosynthetic REs lead-
ing to a 4:2.5 ATP:NADPH production ratio in photosyn-
thesis which is very similar to that of C
3 photosynthesis at 
a 3:2 ratio and in contrast to the classical C 4 calculation of 
5:2 (Kanai and Edwards, 1999). If considering engineering, 
a C
4 cycle with high PEP-CK activity together with malate 
decarboxylation in mitochondria removes the requirement 
Integrative C4 model | 3591
for dimorphic chloroplasts, which results in one less feature 
to be engineered.
It is tempting to think that the type of C 4 photosynthesis 
realized in M. maximus is less efficient because of higher 
energy input for the C
4 cycle (Fig. 3) and because of oxy-
gen production in the bundle sheath, which increases the 
potential for photorespiration. Elevated photorespiration 
is indeed a feature of M. maximus ( Furbank and Badger, 
1982; Ohnishi and Kanai, 1983; Farineau et  al., 1984). 
However, the quantum efficiency of M. maximus is indistin-
guishable from that of Z. mays or S. bicolor ( Ehleringer and 
Pearcy, 1983). It is surprising that the energy requirements 
derived from the model (Fig. 3) and the photorespiratory 
rate (Furbank and Badger, 1982; Ohnishi and Kanai, 1983; 
Farineau et al., 1984) do not predict quantum efficiency.
The blueprint of C
4 metabolism in M. maximus is simpler 
compared with that of NAD-ME and NADP-ME plants, 
because the generation of transfer acids requires fewer adjust-
ments in intracellular transport capacity and photosynthetic 
electron transfer, and at least some part of the insulators that 
prevent leakage of C
4 cycle intermediates into general metab-
olism are known. Thus, it represents an attractive target for 
engineering the C
4 cycle into a C3 crop plant.
