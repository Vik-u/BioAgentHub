Abstract
Background and aim Reprogramming microorganisms to enhance the production of metabolites is a part of 
contemporary synthetic biology, which relies on the availability of genetic tools to successfully manipulate the 
bacteria. Methylorubrum extorquens AM1 is a platform microorganism used to convert C1 compounds into various 
value-added products. However, the repertoire of available plasmids to conveniently and quickly fine-tune the 
expression of multiple genes in this strain is extremely limited compared with other model microorganisms such as 
Escherichia coli. Thus, this study aimed to integrate existing technologies, such as transposon-mediated chromosomal 
integration and cre-lox-mediated recombination, to achieve the diversified expression of target genes through 
multiple chromosomal insertions in M. extorquens AM1.
Results A single plasmid toolkit, pSL-TP-cre-km, containing a miniHimar1 transposon and an inducible cre-lox71/lox66 
system, was constructed and characterized for its multiple chromosomal integration capacity. A co-transcribed 
mcr-egfp cassette [for the production of 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) and a reporting green fluorescent protein] 
was added to construct pTP-cre-mcr-egfp for evaluating its utility in mediating the expression of heterologous 
genes, resulting in the production of 3-HP with a titer of 34.7–55.2 mg/L by two chromosomal integration copies. 
Furthermore, in association with the expression of plasmid-based mcr, 3-HP production increased to 65.5–92.4 mg/L.
Conclusions This study used a multi-round chromosomal integration system based on cre-lox71/lox66 and a 
transposon to construct a single constructed vector. A heterologous mcr gene was introduced through this vector, 
and high expression of 3-hydroxypropionic acid was achieved in M. extorquens. This study provided an efficient

Background
The methylotrophic bacterium Methylorubrum 
extorquens AM1 is an important platform organism for 
converting C1 compounds into various value-added 
products [ 1–6]. Therefore, achieving a high produc -
tion or expression of heterologous genes, which, to a 
large extent, depends on the availability and diversity of 
genetic manipulation, is particularly critical. In the last 
two decades, several basic genetic strategies have been 
devised to facilitate the engineering of M. extorquens  
AM1, including one plasmid replicon system derived 
from broad-host-range IncP for heterologous or endog -
enous genes expression [ 7]; a broad-host-range suicide 
vector pCM433 for marker-free allelic exchange [ 8]; a 
cre-lox recombination system for antibiotic marker recy -
cling [ 9]; several inducible promoters systems [ 10–13]; 
and mini-Tn5 derived transposon mutagenesis to identify 
genes involved in specific biosynthesis pathways [ 14–17]. 
However, co-expressing multiple genes in this strain only 
depends on the solitary IncP-based vector at very low 
copy number expression [ 11]. This is far inferior to the 
multiple compatible replicon types present in Escherichia 
coli, which functionally distributes heterologous genes 
to different plasmids for co-expression [ 18, 19]. Thus, 
the strategy to facilitate the co-existence of multiple 
expression plasmids can improve the operability of M. 
extorquens AM1. Considering the difficulty of developing 
new genetic technologies, integrating existing technolo -
gies may provide a feasible solution.
When it comes to the expression of heterologous meta-
bolic genes, plasmid-based systems and chromosomal 
integration are two distinct strategies commonly used 
[20]. The plasmid-based system used in industrial fer -
mentation potentially leads to extra metabolic burden 
and genetic instability, and therefore, the chromosomal 
integration of exogenous genes is preferred for fermenta -
tion [20, 21]. Among the technologies mentioned earlier 
in M. extorquens  AM1, transposons with a broad host 
feature can permanently mediate chromosomal integra -
tions. This capability allows for creation of transposon 
knockout mutant libraries or stable insertion of a spe -
cific gene of interest at a specific chromosomal site. As 
a result, it becomes a valuable discipline for bacterial 
engineering studies [ 19, 22–25]. Three transposons have 
been used in M. extorquens AM1: mini-Tn5 and miniHi-
mar1, as a random insertion transposon [ 14–17, 26]; and 
mini-Tn7, which evokes a site-specific and single-copy 
chromosomal insertion at the attTn7 site [ 27]. The Mu, 
Tn7, and Tn3 family transposons have been approved to 
have the target immunity effect, which means that the 
transposon inserted into the genome only once thereby 
preventing repeated insertion of the same transposon 
[28, 29]. However, no study explored the target immunity 
effect of random transposons. Moreover, the position 
effect of different insertion sites on the genome caused 
by the random insertion transposon results in heterolo -
gous production diversity [21, 22, 30, 31]. Therefore, spe-
cific strains capable of producing particular amounts can 
be selected from the transposon-based transformants as 
required.
In this study, we aimed to perform multi-round inte -
grations of target genes using miniHimar1, a random 
insertion transposon that only requires a TA dinucleo -
tide sequence for transposition [ 26, 32]. Simultaneously, 
we facilitated multiple chromosomal insertions via a 
single plasmid using a cre-loxP recombination system 
[9, 33], which is essential for the scarless elimination of 
the antibiotic marker. The cre-loxP recombination sys -
tem was previously established in M. extorquens  AM1, 
but in two separate vectors [ 9]. Another application in 
M. extorquens AM1 was the integration of tandem mul -
ticopy of the mevalonate operon into the genome [ 29]. 
However, constant expression of Cre protein may lead 
to excessive integration of loxP sites into the genome, 
thereby reducing the copy number. Therefore, an induc -
ible promoter for cre is needed, as previously described 
[9]. In addition, lox66 and lox71 sites were recruited 
instead of loxP, forming a hybrid lox71/66 site after 
recombination. This could prevent repeated recombina -
tion between different lox sites and instability caused by 
multiple loxP sites in the genome [34, 35].
This study was novel in reporting a multiple chromo -
somal integration system based on cre-lox71/lox66 and 
transposon. The co-transcribed mcr and egfp were pro -
posed, which encoded a malonyl-CoA reductase for 
converting methanol into 3-HP and a reporter green flu -
orescent protein for high-throughput screening, respec -
tively. These genes were inserted into the chromosome of 
M. extorquens AM1 with expected copy numbers. Finally, 
a high 3-HP production was achieved in M. extorquens  
AM1 by combining the transposon-mediated chromo -
somal integration and plasmid-based systems.
Results
Construction of integration vectors
In this study, a chromosomal integration system based 
on the inducible cre-lox71/lox66 recombination system 
and miniHimar1 transposon was constructed in order to 
genetic tool for manipulating M. extorquens, which not only help increase the expression of heterologous genes in M. 
extorquens but also provide a reference for strains lacking genetic manipulation vectors.

explore the potential for multiple integrations of heterol -
ogous genes in the chromosome of M. extorquens AM1. 
All the physical maps of the integration vectors con -
structed in this study are shown in Fig.  1 and Fig. S1, and 
the construction processes are illuminated in Fig. S2–S4. 
First, pSL-TP-cre-km, which contained the fundamen -
tal elements of transposon and recombinase, was con -
structed to be a versatile tool. Briefly, miniHimar1, as a 
mariner-origin transposon, was recruited for an unbiased 
random insertion of heterologous genes into the genome 
of M. extorquens  AM1. The Cre recombinase, followed 
by a kanamycin selectable gene (km), was regulated by 
an inducible hybrid promoter PR/tetO [12], which initi -
ated gene recombination at lox71 and lox66 sites when 
triggered by aTc, leading to the excision of cre and km 
from the genome. In this case, the same vector or another 
plasmid with a km resistance gene could potentially 
enter the cell again. Based on the miniHimar1 transpo -
son and cre-lox71/66 recombination system, we expected 
to achieve multiple integrations of heterologous genes 
into the genome of M. extorquens AM1. Finally, the mcr 
gene responsible for the production of 3-hydroxypropi -
onic acid was recruited to construct pTP-cre-mcr-egfp 
in this study, and a reporter egfp gene co-transcripted 
with mcr was used for a high-throughput screening of the 
target strains. As a control, pCM80-mcr-egfp, generated 
by cloning mcr and egfp into pCM80 and expressed in a 
multicopy extranuclear plasmid form, was constructed. 
Meanwhile, pTP-mcr-egfp without cre was also con -
structed for one entrance of mcr-egfp.
The mechanism of this multiple chromosomal integra -
tion system is illustrated in Fig.  2. In the first round, a 
target plasmid such as pTP-cre-mcr-egfp was electropor-
ated into M. extorquens AM1 competent cells, and genes 
between the two IRs were integrated into the genome via 
transposon. After adding anhydrotetracycline (aTc), the 
Cre bound to the lox71 and lox66 sites, and allow recom-
bination between these two lox sites. This meant that the 
cre and km were eliminated from the chromosome, leav -
ing a hybrid lox71/66 site that was no longer recognized 
by Cre. Simultaneously, the target mcr along with egfp 
was left in the chromosome. As the random integration 
via transposon could result in a differential expression 
of heterologous genes [ 22, 30, 36], strains with the cor -
rect phenotype and higher levels of 3-HP production or 
fluorescence intensity were selected and used as hosts for 
the second round, and so on. This approach allowed us 
to obtain a strain with multiple copies of the target mcr 
gene, as expected.

Verification of the feasibility of different replicons and 
transposon immunity of miniHimar1 in M. extorquens AM1
The p15A replicon has been proved to be deficient in M. 
extorquens AM1 in a previous study [26]. Therefore, plas-
mid p15A-M6.8 can only integrate into the genome via 
miniHimar1 transposon. The replicon of pSL1180 is an 
E. coli– derived M13 ori. Also, pSL-km was constructed 
to test its feasibility in M. extorquens  AM1. Without 
exception, we did not obtain any colonies on the screen 
plate after the electroporation of pSL-km. This indicated 
that the M13 ori is also deficient in M. extorquens AM1. 
Therefore, the transformant colonies that survived on

kanamycin plates after the electroporation of pSL-TP-
cre-km and pTP-cre-mcr-egfp into M. extorquens  AM1 
were resorted to transposon integration into the genome 
by miniHimar1. The IncP-derived oriV replication origin 
of pCM80-mcr-egfp allowed the expression of mcr as an 
extranuclear plasmid with a low copy number.
Although miniHimar1 has been used in numerous 
organisms [37], but no effect of transposon immunity has 
been reported. A former miniHimar1 containing mutant 
M. extorquens  AM1( lacZ), which was constructed by 
transforming p15A-M6.8 into M. extorquens  AM1 [ 26], 
was used as a host to transform the pTP-cre-mcr-egfp 
carrying the same miniHimar1, and kanamycin and 
another tetracycline resistance gene, so as to verify the 
transposon immunity. Abundant colonies were obtained 
in the dual resistance plate, indicating no transposon 
immunity in this miniHimar1. Therefore, miniHimar1 
transposon can be repeatedly employed for chromosomal 
integration.
Function analysis of the cre-lox66/lox71 system
As previously reported, Cre associated with two loxPs 
expressed in the plasmid has been used in M. extorquens 
AM1 [3, 9]. This study, first used lox66 and lox71 sites to 
avoid interactions between multiple loxPs. To verify the 
functionality of the cre-lox71/lox66 system, we tested 
the pSL-TP-cre-km which carries the inducible cre and 
lox71/lox66 sites in E. coli at the plasmid level. Since plas-
mid extraction from M. extorquens AM1 remains unfea -
sible, a smaller plasmid was obtained after inducing Cre, 
resulting in the excision of cre and km by recombination 
(Fig. S5a). Then, pSL-TP-cre-km was transformed into 
M. extorquens  AM1 and the transformants named M. 
extorquens AM1-TC were used for the inducible expres -
sion of Cre. Finally, colonies that lost their growth ability 
in the presence of kanamycin were obtained and deter -
mined to be M. extorquens  AM1-T, indicating that the 
cre-lox71/lox66 was effective in M. extorquens AM1 (Fig. 
S5b). The inducible recombination efficiency was calcu -
lated to be 73.4%, as shown in Fig. S5b. It was confirmed 
by colony-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) that the gene 
elements between lox71 and lox66 sites (including cre 
itself and km) were excised from the genome (Fig. S5c). 
The colonies exhibited no discrepancy in growth with the 
wild host M. extorquens AM1 (Fig. S5d).
Co-transcribed mcr-egfp cassette
The co-transcribed mcr-egfp cassette was constructed 
in pCM80-mcr-egfp by fusing a promoter-less egfp 
downstream of the mcr gene to establish a fluorescence 
reporter system for 3-HP . pCM80-mcr without egfp was 
used as a control. The transformants of pCM80-mcr-egfp 
and pCM80-mcr, referred to as AM1-MG80 and AM1-
M80, respectively, were selected to measure fluorescence 
and 3-HP levels (Fig.  3). The AM1-MG80 was detected 
with green fluorescence, as illustrated in Fig. 3a. The total 
fluorescence intensity increased along with cell growth 
(Fig. 3b), whereas the relative fluorescence intensity (RFI) 
showed a peak in the exponential phase (Fig.  3c). The 
3-HP levels in AM1-MG80 and AM1-M80 were detected

by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) 
with an expected peak production of ≈ 60 mg/L (Fig.  3d 
and S6). It is worth noticing that 3-HP has been previ -
ously identified with a rapid degradation at the transition 
from the exponential phase to stationary phase [ 4], indi-
cating that 3-HP production cannot continue to increase 
with the cell growth (Fig.  3d). Therefore, the relationship 
between 3-HP production and fluorescence expression 
intensity should be further investigated in this regard.
Analysis of position effect in the transposon-mediated 
single chromosomal integration recombinants
Considering the difference in heterologous gene expres -
sion caused by transposon insertion site effects [ 22, 30, 
31], the mcr-egfp cassette was used as an indication sys -
tem for the transposon-mediated position effect. For 
this, pTP-cre-mcr-egfp and pTP-mcr-egfp, containing 
both the transposon and the mcr-egfp cassette, were 
transformed into M. extorquens  AM1, and the corre -
sponding single chromosomal integration recombinants 
were named AM1-MGTC and AM1-MGT, respectively. 
Before the follow-up experiments, the sampling time 
points were required to be determined, so that three iso -
lates of each transformant could be used for detecting 
fluorescence intensity and growth OD 600 till the station -
ary stage. The result showed that the change in the fluo -
rescence of transformants was associated not only with 
cell OD600 but also with an obvious fluctuation between 
the parallels since OD600 was ≈ 0.8 (Fig. 4a). Nevertheless, 
the plasmid-based AM1-MG80 showed a stable change 
between the parallels (Fig.  4a). OD600 ≈ 0.8-1.0, indicating 
the late exponential phage, was preferred for most enzy -
matic activity or metabolomic analysis in M. extorquens  
AM1 transformants [ 26, 38]. Taken together, the fluo -
rescence detection in the late exponential phase with an 
OD600 of 0.9 ± 0.1was used to determine whether it was 
competent for a high-throughput reporting system for 
3-HP production. Subsequently, 25 isolates from each 
transformant were selected for detecting the fluorescence 
intensity and 3-HP production. As expected, different 
isolates displayed fluctuating expression levels, as shown 
in Fig. 4b, which was mainly attributed to the influence of 
genome insertion sites through the transposon instead of 
the biological differences [ 22]. Nonetheless, we observed 
a positive correlation between the expression of fluo -
rescence intensity and 3-HP production within the cor -
responding isolates. This suggested that co-transcribed 
mcr and egfp regulated transcriptional levels in the cas -
sette in a synchronized manner. In addition, the transpo -
son recombinants showed a low expression of mcr-egfp 
genes when compared with AM1-MG80, which had mul-
tiple copies via an extranuclear plasmid as a control, due 
to the single insertion copy by the transposon (Fig.  4b). 
Thus, an effective fluorescence reporter system for the

high-throughput screening of heterologous gene expres -
sion, such as mcr, was developed in this study. The iso -
lates with a high 3-HP production were further executed 
for the second round of transformation.
Induction and second-round chromosomal integration
The no. 14 of the recombinant AM1-MGTC, which 
exhibited a relatively high expression of mcr-egfp 
(25.7 mg/L of 3-HP , which was 0.42 times that of strain 
AM1-MG80), was selected as the host for the second 
round of genome integration. First, the cre and km ele -
ments within AM1-MGTC were eliminated from the 
genome after induction by aTc. The corresponding 
colonies were identified and verified on plates with and 
without kanamycin. The no. 14 of the recombinant AM1-
MGTC displayed an inducible recombination efficiency 
of 27.1%, which was far less than that of the recombi -
nant with pSL-TP-cre-km mentioned above (Fig. S7a). 
This was mainly attributed to the existence of an extra 
tetR gene, which was located in front of tetA introduced 
by pTP-cre-mcr-egfp in AM1-MGTC. The TetR repres -
sor encoded by tetR could interact with the promoter of 
tetA or tetO (Fig. S7b) and repress its expression. Mean -
while, the TetR repressor had a strong affinity for tetra -
cycline, inactivated tetracycline and anhydrotetracycline 
(aTc, a high-affinity ligand) at extremely low concentra -
tions [ 26, 39, 40]. The inducible PR/tetO promoter was 
dose-dependent with a 30-fold regulatory range when 
responding to a range of 0.1– 50 ng/mL of aTc [ 12]. 
Therefore, we increased the concentration of aTc from 
25 ng/mL to 50 ng/mL, and then the recombination effi -
ciency up increased to 64.2% (Fig. S7a), suggesting that 
we should either increase the concentration of inducer or 
switch to another antibiotic resistance marker instead of 
tetA.
After induction, the cre-km eliminated mutants 
screened from the photocopying plate were confirmed by 
colony PCR, fluorescence intensity, and 3-HP production 
detection. The corrected colonies were then used as hosts 
for the second round of transformation of pTP-cre-mcr-
egfp to make transformant AM1-2MGTC. Further, 50 
colonies of AM1-2MGTC were picked, and their fluores -
cence intensities were significantly increased compared 
with those of AM1-MGTC colonies (Fig.  5a). The top 10 
strains were chosen for 3-HP detection, and all of them 
produced 3-HP at levels from 34.7  mg/L to 55.2  mg/L 
(Fig. 5b).
Combination use of two types of the expression plasmid
Next, we attempted to combine the transposon integra -
tion plasmid and the extranuclear plasmid. On the one 
hand, pTP-cre-mcr-egfp was transformed into the host 
AM1-MG80 to make the recombinant strain AM1-DMG. 
Then 50 colonies were picked, which showed the highest 
fluorescence intensity among all the constructed strains. 
The top 10 isolates exhibited a 3-HP production capac -
ity ranging from 65.5  mg/L to 92.4  mg/L, representing 
the highest yield in this study. However, when plasmid 
pCM80-mcr-egfp was transformed into the candidate 
isolate of AM1-2MGTC, no more significant increase in

fluorescence intensity or 3-HP production was observed 
in the corresponding colonies (AM1-2DMG) compared 
with those of AM1-MG80 (Fig.  5a and b). This might be 
due to the metabolic restriction of M. extorquens  AM1 
or the transcriptional obstacle of the mcr gene. There -
fore, quantitative Real-Time PCR (qRT-PCR) was per -
formed to demonstrate that the transcriptional level of 
mcr was positively correlated with gene copy numbers 
but was not exactly consistent with the 3-HP production 
in each constructed strain type, especially in the combi -
nation expression strains (Fig.  5b and c). Specifically, the 
strain AM1-2DMG, which simultaneously contained two 
copies of chromosome-integrated mcr and an extracel -
lular plasmid-based mcr, showed the highest transcrip -
tional expression, but a lower yield of 3-HP compared 
with AM1-DMG, which had one less integrated mcr 
copy number. However, AM1-2MGTC displayed 2.9-fold 
more expression compared with AM1-MGTC, beyond 
the ratio of integrated gene copy number. Again, these 
results demonstrated that not only gene copy numbers, 
but also chromosomal integration sites had an important 
influence on gene transcriptional expression levels.
Discussion
Several genetic operation elements have been developed 
for M. extorquens  AM1, a model methylotrophic strain 
with potential for industrial application [ 7, 9, 12, 41]. 
However, using only IncP-derived extranuclear plasmids 
and the insufficiency of antibiotic-resistance markers 
have limited the genetic manipulation and application of 
M. extorquens  AM1 in industrial biotechnology. More -
over, plasmid-based systems typically lead to high- and 
low-performance variants in culture due to cell-to-cell 
variations caused by plasmid genetic instability, which 
affects their suitability in large-scale or long-term indus -
trial fermentation [20, 42]. Therefore, chromosomal inte-
gration is a preferable approach, as genes can be stably 
maintained without selective antibiotics and exhibit 
consistent gene expression at a single-cell level [ 43]. For 
prokaryotic microbes, the genomic integration of foreign 
genes is usually mediated by homologous recombina -
tion (HR) [44] and site-specific recombination (SSR) [45]. 
Compared with HR, SSR is much more time- and effort-
saving, but it requires a selection marker to identify its 
occurrence. Thereafter, the targeted integration site is 
destroyed, hindering the multi-round integration of for -
eign genes. However, transposon-mediated chromosomal 
integration involves multi-round integration because 
of no perference for insertion sequence. Furthermore, 
the transformants generated after transposition result 
in different expression levels of foreign genes due to the 
position effect caused by adjacent genes [ 22, 30, 31], 
providing a new idea for screening strains with a certain 
level of expression or yield as required. Among all the 
transposons used in M. extorquens AM1, the miniHimar, 
derived from an extensively used mariner transposon 
with a broad host range [ 22, 46], was identified with no 
transposon immunity in M. extorquens AM1. It was then 
used to construct a multi-round chromosomal integra -
tion system in this study. In particular, the cre-loxP sys -
tem, a well-known recombination method for eliminating 
the resistance marker without a scar [ 19, 47–49], was 
recruited to resolve the selection marker issue caused by 
synchronous integration. With modification, the induc -
ible cre-lox71/lox66-km cassette was constructed, facili -
tating a stable integrated copy number, allowing for the 
reuse of the selective marker ( km resistance gene), and 
also protecting the host from the toxic effects of continu -
ous Cre expression. With these initiatives, two rounds of 
integration were achieved through a single constructed 
vector (pSL-TP-cre-km), thus expanding the genetic 
manipulation capacity of M. extorquens AM1.
A heterologous mcr gene was introduced to produce 
3-HP via the malonyl-CoA pathway to test and verify 
the application of the constructed pSL-TP-cre-km sys -
tem. Before that, the established co-transcribed mcr-egfp 
demonstrated a positive correlation between 3-HP pro -
duction and fluorescence intensity at specific optical den-
sity points; egfp was normally used as a high-throughput 
screening indicator. Accordingly, mcr-egfp was used to 
construct an expression vector in the form of pTP-cre-
mcr-egfp. After the first round of transformation, isolates 
(AM1-MGTC) were identified with 3-HP titers ranging 
from 0.12 to 0.46 times that of strain AM1-MG80, which 
was designated as the original plasmid-based expression. 
Among these, the isolate with the highest titer was con -
sistent with the measured mcr transcription level and 
thus served as a host for the second round of transforma-
tion after induction (Figs.  4 and 5). The maximum 3-HP 
production from the transformants of the second integra-
tion (AM1-2MGTC) increased to 55.2 mg/L, which was 
90% of the original plasmid-based yield. These results 
suggested that the specific titer was enhanced when an 
extra copy of mcr was integrated into the chromosome. 
However, the most productive isolate of AM1-2MGTC 
was proportional to the gene copy number, when com -
pared with its host. Nonetheless, it was quite close to 
the production of plasmid-based AM1-MG80, which 
contained the plasmid with eight copy numbers in gen -
eral [11]. It was speculated that the integration site effect 
overrode the influence of plasmid-based gene copy num -
bers and the plasmid-based overexpression was already 
a burden to M. extorquens  AM1, leading to a slight 
increase in 3-HP production in the combination expres -
sion strains (AM1-DMG and AM1-2DMG). So far, the 
highest 3-HP production reported in M. extorquens AM1 
was 91.2 mg/L, which was based on a constructed ribu -
lose monophosphate pathway cycle and intrinsic serine 
Page 9 of 13
Zhu et al. Microbial Cell Factories            (2024) 23:5 
cycle [38]. A similar titer of 92.4 mg/L was obtained with 
the AM1-DMG strain constructed by the combination 
expression strategy. The comparison of 3-HP titer and 
gene transcriptional activity between AM1-DMG and 
AM1-2DMG revealed a deficiency, which was caused 
by excessive copies that overwhelmed the host cell and 
impaired the metabolic capacity or by the insufficiency of 
the rate-limiting enzymes for the pathway [ 50, 51]. The 
production of 3-HP requires the consumption of one 
molecule of acetyl-CoA, one molecule of ATP , and two 
molecules of NADPH [ 4]. More in-depth and detailed 
experiments need to be executed to verify the findings.
The mcr gene copy number in AM1-2MGTC was 
increased after two rounds of chromosomal integration, 
and the corresponding 3-HP titer was much higher than 
that in AM1-MGTC. This indicated that the chromo -
somal integration of multiple gene copies had a signifi -
cant effect in terms of improving the gene copy number 
and its production. In other words, increasing the gene 
copy numbers through multiple rounds of integration 
was an effective approach for heterologous expression 
under the influence of integrated sites of transposon 
within a certain limit. A large number of studies proved 
that chromosomal multiple position integration strat -
egy could be more efficient in heterologous biosynthesis, 
whether integrating tandem copies of the same gene into 
a specific site or integrating different genes into differ -
ent sites [ 29, 52]. Also, it is possible to observe a bipo -
lar effect of different integration sites, either positive or 
negative, on the titer based on the differences between 
individual isolates of certain transformants. Therefore, 
the insertion sites of the transformants need to be deter -
mined in follow-up experiments to provide more rational 
interpretation and guidance.
Conclusion
This study constructed a multicopy chromosomal inte -
gration expression system in M. extorquens  AM1 based 
on an inducible cre-lox71/lox66 recombination system 
and miniHimar1 transposon. The system allowed for 
rapid insertion of the heterologous mcr gene and the cre-
ation of mutants with high levels of corresponding 3-HP 
yield, with the resistance gene eliminated. This is benefi -
cial for industrial applications. The extensive distribution 
of the random insertion sites also provided additional 
references for screening high-expression strains. Finally, 
we could elevate 3-HP titer in M. extorquens AM1 using 
a combination of one-round chromosomal integration 
and an extranuclear plasmid. Our findings will extend the 
genetic manipulation of M. extorquens AM1 and improve 
its potential for heterologous expression.

the antibiotics before or after introduction of the relevant 
genes. pSL1180 and p15A-M6.8, proved to be suicide 
plasmids in M. extorquens  in this study, were used for 
vector construction in E. coli.  The IncP replicon-based 
plasmids pCM80, pCM157, pLC291, pCM80-mcr, and 
pCM80-egfp were used as the original vector for further 
construction. All vectors constructed in this study are 
listed in Table  1. Especially, pCM80 and pSL1180 were 
used as backbones for a series of vector construction; 
p15A-M6.8 provided the p15A replicon, miniHimar1 
transposon and lacZ; pCM157 provided the cre gene; 
pLC291 provided the promoter PR/tetO induced by aTc; 
and pX458 provided the fluorescent gene egfp.
Construction of the integration vector pSL-TP-cre-km 
with polynary elements of cre-lox71/66 and miniHimar1 
transposon
The cre gene, which was amplified from pCM157 using 
primer pairs Cre-F (5’-gga AGATCTATGTCCAATT-
TACTGACCGTAC-3’) and Cre-R (5’-ccgGAATTCCTA-
ATCGCCATCTTCCAGC-3’) (restriction sites BglII 
and EcoRI are underlined), was cloned into pLC291 to 
form pLC-Cre. The miniHimar1 transposon elements 
(IR-TP-IR), which was amplified from p15A-M6.8 using 
primer pairs TP-F (5’-cgc GGATCCCGCCTTCTTGAC-
GAGTTC-3’) (restriction site sequence for BamHI are 
underlined) and TP-R (5’- ATTCCGGAGTATACG -
TAGCC − 3’), was cloned into pSL1180 to create pSL-TP .
The lox71 and lox66 were incorporated into the ends 
of forward and reverse primers, respectively: Lox71-
pro-F (5’-cc GTTAACTACCGTTCGTATAGCATACAT-
TATACGAAGTTAT CTGGCACGACAGGTTTCC-3’) 
and Lox66-km-R (5’-gg ACTAGTTACCGTTCGTATA-
ATGTATGCTATACGAAGT TAT CATAAACAGTAA -
TACAAGGGGTG-3’) (restriction sites HpaI and SpeI are 
underlined and the lox71 and lox66 sites are italicized). 
Then the 4.2-kb fragment, comprising a terminator, a 
Page 10 of 13
Zhu et al. Microbial Cell Factories            (2024) 23:5 
PR/tetO inducible promoter, a cre gene and a kanamy -
cin antibiotic gene, was amplified from pLC-Cre using 
primer pairs Lox71-pro-F and Lox66-km-R. The result -
ing fragment was cloned into pSL-TP to create the poly -
nary plasmid pSL-TP-cre-km (Fig. S2), which was used 
as the basic integrated vector for introducing the target 
gene later. Meanwhile, the 1.0-kb kanamycin gene frag -
ment amplified from pLC291 using primer pairs of Km-F 
(5’-ccgGAATTCCGTCCCGTCAAGTCAGCGT-3’) and 
Km-R (5’-ccc AAGCTTGCCATCCATCCCCGTGTC-3’) 
(restriction sites are underlined) was cloned into the cor -
responding region of pSL1180 to form pSL-km, as a con -
trol plasmid.
Construction of vectors with co-transcribed mcr and 
fluorescent report gene egfp
In this study, the mcr gene, which was amplified 
using primer pairs mcr-F (5’-ccc AAGCTTCTCGA-
GATGAGCGGAACAGGACGAC-3’) and mcr-R 
(5’-cgcGGATCCCTCGAGTTACACGGTAATCGCCC -
GTC-3’), was transferred into pCM80 to generate 
pCM80-mcr. The promoterless fluorescent gene egfp was 
designed to locate afterward mcr forming a co-transcript. 
The corresponding plasmid pCM80-mcr-egfp was con -
structed by ligating the 7.6-kb NheI-BamHI fragment 
from pCM80-eGFP with the 4.0-kb NheI-BamHI frag -
ment from pCM80-mcr (Fig. S3).
For further construction, the homo-tail enzymes SpeI 
and NheI were used to combine all the necessary ele -
ments. Specifically, the SpeI digested and lined fragment 
of pSL-TP-cre-km, was combined with the NheI-digested 
fragment of pCM80-mcr-egfp. The resulting vector was 
named pCM-TP-cre-mcr-egfp and then digested with 
SfiI to remove oriV replicon origin. The remaining 17-kb 
fragment was self-ligated to generate the target mul -
tiple insertion plasmid, which was named pTP-cre-mcr-
egfp. Meanwhile, the 4.7 kb NheI-EcoRI fragment from 
pCM80-mcr-egfp was blunted and then ligated into

SmaI-lined fragment of p15A-M6.8 to create a single

served as a control (Fig. S4).
Electroporation of M. extorquens AM1
The plasmids were transformed into M. extorquens AM1 
by electroporation as described in a previous study [ 53], 
with a few adjustments. Initially, M. extorquens AM1 cells 
were grown in a 50-mL flask until the culture reached 
OD600 of 0.8. The cells were then collected, washed thrice 
with ice-cold water to prepare competent cells, and 
resuspended in 1 mL ddH 2O for distribution. Next, 100 
µL of competent cells mixed with 2 µg of plasmid DNA 
were transferred into a 1 mm-gap cuvette placed on ice 
and operated at a voltage of 1800 V using the electropor -
ator (Eppendorf, Germany). The mixture was transferred 
into 2 mL liquid medium in a 10 mL tube and incubated 
at 30℃ with a rotational speed of 200  rpm for 5  h. 100 
µL of the culture was subsequently spread onto selective 
plates. The objective colonies appeared after 3–5 days via 
antibiotic resistance, which were confirmed by colony 
PCR.
Confirmation of the miniHimar1 transposon function
The transposon-containing plasmids pSL-TP-cre-km 
and p15A-M6.8 were individually transferred into M. 
extorquens AM1 to detect the transformants in the 
kanamycin-selection plate. In contrast, the transposon-
free plasmid pSL-km was used as a negative control. 
The resultant transformants obtained from the transfor -
mation of p15A-M6.8 were identified as M. extorquens  
AM1(lacZ). The plasmid pSL-TP-cre-km was then trans -
formed into M. extorquens AM1(lacZ) to detect transpo-
son immunity.
Functional assay of the cre-lox71/66 system and the second 
round of chromosomal integration
The plasmid pSL-TP-cre-km was transformed into M. 
extorquens AM1 to investigate the function of the cre-
lox71/66 system., The obtained transformants were ini -
tially incubated in a km-free liquid medium till OD 600 
reached 0.8. Subsequently, aTc was added at a final con -
centration of 25 ng/mL for 2–3days to induce Cre expres-
sion, facilitating the removal of the regions between 
lox71 and lox66 sites, which contained the kanamycin 
resistance gene. After induction, an aliquot (50 µL) was 
spread onto a plate and incubated at 30 °C. Single colo -
nies were picked and screened for kanamycin resistance. 
The recombination efficiency of Cre was calculated by 
dividing the number of total colonies by the number of 
kanamycin-sensitive colonies present.
Following the first round of electroporation, the trans -
formants were examined for detecting the gene expres -
sion levels, and the isolate that exhibited the desired 
traits was selected as the host of the second round. Then, 
the host was induced by aTc to initiate recombination 
by cre-lox71/lox66 elements, and the resulting kanamy -
cin-sensitive clones were screened to ensure successful 
recombination. This process was repeated until the antic-
ipated colonies with a second copy of the target genes 
were obtained.
Detection of relative green fluorescence intensity
The selected M. extorquens colonies with egfp expression 
were cultured for 2 days until OD 600 reached approxi -
mately 0.8 in the tube with the medium at 30 ℃. Sub -
sequently, the cultures were diluted into 50 mL of the 
medium at an initial OD 600 of 0.01 in shaking flasks. The 
optical density and fluorescence were measured at des -
ignated intervals over 60  h period. The expression lev -
els of green fluorescent protein were quantified using a 
BioTek Cytation I cell imaging microaperture plate detec-
tion system (BioTek, USA). For each measurement, 200 
µL of each strain culture was added into each well of 
the 96-well plate for fluorescence reader (GFP: excita -
tion 485/20 nm, emission 528/20 nm) and absorbance 
at 600  nm (OD 600). The absorbance at 900 and 977  nm 
(OD900 andOD977) was recorded once to correct the opti -
cal path [54]. The negative control strain was included in 
every plate and its fluorescence was subtracted for nor -
malization. The fluorescence intensity (also referred to as 
fluorescein activity) was calculated as fluorescence/OD600 
at each time point [ 55]. Each culture was performed in 
triplicates.
3-Hydroxypropionic acid quantification
The quantification of 3-HP was performed using the 
method described in a previous method [ 4]. Briefly, 100 
mL of cell culture with an OD 600 between 1.0 ± 0.1 was 
collected by centrifuging at 10,000 ×g for 10  min. The 
supernatant was used as a sample for 3-HP detection. 
The concentration of 3-HP was determined by LC–MS 
carried out using an Agilent LCQQQ-MS system (Agi -
lent 1290 Infinity-6460, Agilent Corp. CA, USA) in the 
negative-ion mode. An aliquot of 10 µL of the sample 
was injected and separated on an Agilent SB C18 col -
umn (100 × 2.1  mm, 1.8  μm) at a temperature of 35  °C, 
with mobile phase A consisting of 10% ( v/v) buffer in 
water and mobile phase B consisting 10% ( v/v) buffer 
in acetonitrile. The buffer consisted of 200 mM formic 
acid adjusted to pH4.0 with ammonium hydroxide solu -
tion. The linear gradient was as follows: 0–3 min, 5–10% 
B; 3–5 min, 100% B; 5–7 min, 5% B at a flow rate of 0.2 
mL/min. 3-HP was identified by comparison to the reten-
tion time, 249  nm of ultraviolet (UV) spectra, and the 
MS2 pattern of the authentic reference standard sample, 
which was purchased from the Tokyo Chemical Industry

(Tokyo, Japan). Each titer was measured in biological 
triplicates.
RNA extraction and qRT-PCR analysis
Total RNA of M. extorquens  strain samples were 
extracted from 3 mL of cells in the mid-exponen -
tial phase (OD 600 of 1.0 ± 0.1) using the TransZol Up 
RNAspin Mini Kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) 
following the manufacturer’s instruction. The RNA con -
centration was measured using a NanoDrop One Micro -
volume UV-Vis Spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific, MA, USA). The cDNA library was prepared 
using a HiScrip IIIQRT SuperMix kit for qPCR (Vazyme 
Biotech Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China) following the manu -
facturer’s instruction. The reaction system was prepared 
using AceQ Universal SYBR qPCR Master Mix (Vazyme, 
Nanjing, China) following the manufacturer’s protocol 
in a total volume of 10 µL for each tube. Further, qPCR 
was performed using QuantStudio 5 ABI 7500 real-time 
PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Genes encoding 
16S ribosomal protein ( rpsB) were used as internal con -
trol genes. The relative expression levels were calculated 
using the relative 2 −(ΔΔCt) method, and the expression 
level was normalized to the expression level of the con -
trol genes. The primer pairs used for qRT-PCR were as 
follows: rpsB-F (5’-CACCCGCAACAACATCCAC-3’) 
and rpsB-R (5’-GTCTTCCAGTTGGTCAGCATG-3’) 
used for rpsB; and mcr-F (5’-ACAGGACGACTGGCAG-
GAAAG-3’) and mcr-R (5’-GAATCTCGGCCAGAC -
GACGC-3’) used for mcr.
Statistical analysis
Standard curves, GFP expression, and 3-HP produc -
tion were analyzed using GraphPad Prism 8.0 software 
and Excel 2016 in this study. Statistical analysis was per -
formed using the Student t test. Data were presented as 
the mean ± SDs (standard deviation); ** p < 0.01.
