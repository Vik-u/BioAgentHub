ABSTRACT: Greener and cheaper alternatives to petrol-based
supports have been studied in recent years to implement
biocatalysis in industrial processes exploiting enzyme immobiliza-
tion. Among these, hydroxyapatite (HAP) represents a suitable
candidate thanks to its structural stability, nontoxicity, large surface
area, and ease of surface modification. As it can be sourced from
waste, it also fulfills the circular economy principles. This work
explored the use of HAP for covalent immobilization using three
model enzymes: a vanadium-dependent chloroperoxidase from
Curvularia inaequalis (CiVCPO), an L -tyrosine decarboxylase from
Lactobacillus brevis (LbTDC), and an R-selective transaminase from
Thermomyces stellatus (TsRTA). Different strategies were tested,
and derivatization with (3-aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES)
followed by glutaraldehyde activation was found to be the most widely applicable. LbTDC and TsRTA immobilized through this
strategy were tested in multiple reaction cycles to assess their stability and reusability, with promising results.

INTRODUCTION
Enzyme immobilization has been recognized in recent years as
a key technology to implement biocatalysis at the industrial
level. This process, consisting of binding the protein on a
support which is insoluble in the reaction solvent, despite
usually lowering the enzymatic activity, provides an increase in
protein stability under adverse conditions, such as extreme
pHs, temperatures, and the presence of organic solvents, and
allows the possibility of recycling the catalyst multiple times,
leading to an overall decrease in process costs.
1
Among all of
the possible immobilization techniques, the formation of
covalent bonds between the support and the enzyme grants
higher stabilities and shelf lives of the catalyst.
2
Moreover, the choice of the carrier must be carefully
investigated, since it can greatly influence the properties of the
final catalyst. In general, a good candidate material for enzyme
immobilization should present a high surface area, be insoluble
under the intended reaction conditions, chemically, structur-
ally, and thermally stable, and, in order to facilitate its
application at an industrial level, it should be cheap and
environmentally friendly.

Calcium hydroxyapatite (HAP,

(PO

) is a suitable candidate to be used as a
support in enzyme immobilization thanks to its insolubility in
water (K
PS
≈ 2.34 × 10
−59
), high mechanical strength, and
surface area (about 100 m
2
g
−1
). As the main inorganic
component in mammalian bone tissue, it is also biocompatible.
For these reasons, HAP has been studied since the ‘90s as a
carrier for the immobilization of various enzymes, but most of
the work reported in literature makes use of direct adsorption
of the protein on the support, exploiting the ability of glutamic
and aspartic acid residues to chelate calcium ions or other
metals.
4,5
The covalent bonding of enzymes on hydroxyapatite
has been reported as well, but to a minor extent and with a
limited number of strategies.
6
The most applied strategy
reported in literature for covalent immobilization on HAP,
which has been also applied to silica supports,
7
consists in a
first derivatization of the inorganic support with (3-
aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES) providing a handle
with a primary amino group that is then reacted with
glutaraldehyde that acts as a linker between the carrier and
the lysine residues of the enzyme.
8
In this work, we investigated three different strategies for
covalent immobilization on hydroxyapatite and tested them
with three different model enzymes for which literature
precedence on immobilization was available for comparative
purposes.

The first enzyme, a vanadium-dependent chloroperoxidase
from Curvularia inaequalis (CiVCPO, E.C. 1.11.1.10), is a
monomeric protein of cylindrical shape with a length of about
80 Å and a diameter of 55 Å.

The second one is a tyrosine decarboxylase from
Lactobacillus brevis (LbTDC, E.C. 4.1.1.25). LbTDC is a
pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzyme with an
asymmetric homodimeric structure. Its main activity is
expressed in the decarboxylation reaction of L -tyrosine to
produce tyramine, but it can also convert L -DOPA into
dopamine.
19
Finally, the R-selective transaminase from Thermomyces
stellatus (TsRTA) was selected. This enzyme is present in
solution in an equilibrium between its dimeric and tetrameric
forms and shows a good substrate scope for both the amine
donor and the acceptor with high enantioselectivities of the
product.

High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analyses
were carried out through a Liquid Chromatography UHPLC
system equipped with a binary pump, a diode array detector
(Dionex UltiMate 3000, Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA,
USA), and an X-Bridge BEH C18 column (3.5 μm, 2.1 mm ×

water, and eluent B was methanol. The flow rate was set at 1
mL/min, the column was thermostated at 45 °C, and the
following gradient was used: 0−1 min 1% B, 1−7 linear
gradient to 40% B, 7−9 linear gradient to 45% B, and 9−10
linear gradient to 1% B. Detection was set at 280 nm.
All samples were dissolved in HCl (0.2% wt.) and filtered
with a 0.45 μm nylon filter before injection.

Every 30 min, NH
4
OH (30%, 10 mL) was added to
maintain the pH around 10. The reaction was stirred at 80 °C
for 2 h and 30 min and then left aging under stirring for 5 min.
Hot filtration under reduced pressure was followed by
washes with hot Milli-Q water until the filtrate reached a
neutral pH (ca. 4 × 500 mL). The obtained white solid was
dried at 70 °C in vacuo for 16 h and then at 120 °C for 8 h.
The dried solid was ground to obtain homogeneous particle
size, leading to a white powder.
To obtain larger particle sizes, the powder was first pressed
using a hydraulic press; the resulting wafer was then ground
and sieved using woven wire mesh stainless steel sieves by
Endecotts, to obtain a homogeneous particles in the size range
of 180−250 μm.
Hydroxyapatite Functionalization with (3-
Aminopropyl)triethoxysilane (APTES). Hydroxyapatite
(500 mg, particle size: 180−250 μm) was put in a 15 mL
Falcon tube and suspended in neat APTES (2 mL). The
suspension was mixed at room temperature for 16 h by using
an orbital shaker.
Then, the mixture was diluted with dichloromethane (2
mL), and the supernatant was removed and discarded. The
solid was washed with dichloromethane (3 × 2 mL) and left to
dry in the air for 4 h.

For additional information about
sequence and structure analysis, see Figures S3−S8. Briefly,
single colonies of recombinant Escherichia coli containing the
plasmid coding for the enzyme (Arctic Express strain was used
to express CiVCPO cloned into a pBAD vector, BL21 (DE3)
for LbTDC harbored in a pRSETb vector, and BL21 STAR
(DE3) for TsRTA harbored in pET22b(+)) were inoculated
into the proper medium (LB for CiVCPO, LB + D -glucose 1%
wt. for LbTDC, and TB + lactose 5 g/L for TsRTA)
supplemented with ampicillin (0.1 mg/mL) and incubated at
37 °C and 150 rpm for a certain amount of time (4 h in the
case of TsRTA, until reaching an OD
600
between 0.6 and 0.8
cells/mL for the other enzymes). Then, a suitable inducer was
added ( L -arabinose 0.02% wt. for CiVCPO, IPTG 0.2 mM for
LbTDC, and nothing for TsRTA), and the culture was shaken
at 150 rpm, at the proper temperature for a defined amount of
time (16 °C for 72 h for CiVCPO, 25 °C for 4 h for LbTDC,
and 25 °C for 20 h for TsRTA).
The cells were harvested by centrifugation (2500 RCF, 20
min, 4 °C), resuspended in loading buffer (see below) (2 mL/
g of dry cell), and disrupted via sonication (10 min at 40%
amplitude, 5 s ON + 5 s OFF cycles, using a FisherBrand
sonicator). The cell debris was removed by centrifugation
(12,100 RCF, 45 min, 4 °C), and the cell-free extract was
filtered through a 0.45 μm pore-size syringe filter before
purification via Ni-affinity chromatography for (LbTDC and

procedure: an equal amount of isopropanol was added to the
cell-free extract to precipitate unstable proteins and nuclei
acids that were removed by centrifugation (12,100 RCF, 30

CiVCPO Activity Assay. CiVCPO (0.8 mg/mL, 20 μL)
was added to the activity assay solution (monochlorodimedone
0.1 mM + H
2
O
2
10 mM + KBr 5 mM in citrate buffer 0.1 M,
pH 5, 1 mL). The reaction was mixed at 30 °C for 3 min in a
cuvette, and the depletion of monochlorodimedone was
followed by registering the absorbance at 290 nm. One unit
of CiVCPO is defined as the amount of enzyme that catalyzes
the depletion of 1 μmol/mL of monochlorodimedone in 1
min.
The immobilized CiVCPO activity was measured in a similar
way: the solid (50 mg) was suspended in the activity reagents’
solution (1 mL), and the reaction was stirred at room
temperature for 10 min. At different reaction times (0, 1, 2, 3,
4, 6, 8, and 10 min), an aliquot of supernatant (40 μL) was
taken and diluted 1:25 in citrate buffer (0.1 M, pH 5). The
depletion of monochlorodimedone was followed by measuring
the absorbance at 290 nm.
LbTDC Activity Assay. LbTDC (0.1 mg/mL, 30 μL or 20
mg of the immobilized one) was added to the activity assay
solution ( L -tyrosine 2.5 mM + PLP 0.2 mM in AcONa 200
mM, pH 5, 1 mL). The reaction mixture was mixed at 37 °C
for 20 min. At different reaction times (0, 5, 10, 15, and 20
min), an aliquot of reaction mixture (50 μL) was taken and
diluted 1:8 in HCl (0.2% wt., 350 μL) to quench the reaction.
The samples were subjected to HPLC analyses to monitor the
L -tyrosine depletion.
One unit of LbTDC is defined as the amount of enzyme that
consumes 1 μmol/mL of L -tyrosine in 1 min.
TsRTA Activity Assay. TsRTA (0.5 mg/mL, 20 μL) was
added to the activity assay solution (sodium pyruvate 2.5 mM
+ (R)-methylbenzyl amine 2.5 mM + PLP 0.1 mM in KPi 50
mM + 0.25% DMSO, pH 8, 1 mL). The reaction mixture was
stirred at 25 °C in a cuvette. Acetophenone formation was
monitored by registering the absorbance at 245 nm for 4 min.
One unit of TsRTA is defined as the amount of enzyme that
produces 1 μmol/mL of acetophenone in 1 min.
The immobilized TsRTA activity was similarly measured:
the solid (20 or 50 mg) was transferred in a 15 mL Falcon tube
and suspended in the activity reagents’ solution (5 mL for 20
mg or 10 mL for 50 mg of immobilized enzyme). The reaction
mixture was stirred at room temperature with an orbital shaker
for 10 min. Every minute, the supernatant (1 mL) was
removed, its absorbance at 245 nm was measured, and it was
readded to the reaction mixture.
Immobilization on HAP-APTES with Glutaraldehyde.
Hydroxyapatite derivatized with APTES (HAP-APTES, 20
mg) was suspended in a glutaraldehyde solution (GA, 10% wt.,
2 mL) and mixed with an orbital shaker at room temperature
for 1 h. During this period, the support turned from white to
brown and finally to red. Then the mixture was filtered, and the
solid was washed with the immobilization buffer (citrate 0.1 M,
pH 5 for CiVCPO, AcONa 200 mM + PLP 0.2 mM, pH 5 for
LbTDC, and KPi 50 mM + PLP 0.1 mM, pH 8 for TsRTA, 3 ×
1 mL). The solid was then resuspended in a solution of
enzyme in immobilization buffer (different enzyme loading,
400 μL) and mixed with an orbital shaker at room temperature
for 24 h (Figure S12).
The mixture was then filtered, and the solid was washed with
immobilization buffer (2 × 400 μL). The protein concen-
tration in both filtrate and washing was evaluated via Bradford
assay, and the immobilized enzyme activity was measured.
Immobilization on HAP-GLYMO Mediated by Co(II)
Ions. Hydroxyapatite derivatized with GLYMO (HAP-
GLYMO, 50 mg) was suspended in modification buffer
(iminodiacetic acid 2 M in sodium borate 0.1 M, pH 8, 100
μL) and stirred at room temperature for 2 h using an orbital
shaker. Then the mixture was filtered, and the solid was
washed with Milli-Q water (5 × 1 mL). The solid was
resuspended in metal buffer (CoCl
2
30 mg/mL in Milli-Q
water, 250 μL) and mixed at room temperature for 1 h during
which it turned from white to purple. The mixture was then
filtered, and the solid was washed again with Milli-Q water (5
× 1 mL) and then resuspended in an enzyme solution
(different protein concentrations in KPi 50 mM, pH 8, 1 mL).
The reaction was stirred at room temperature for 24 h (see
Figure S13).
The mixture was then filtered again, and the solid was
washed with desorption buffer (EDTA 50 mM + NaCl 0.5 M
in KPi 50 mM, pH 7.2, 3 × 1 mL). The protein concentration
in the filtrate and the washing was measured via Bradford
assay.
The solid was resuspended in blocking buffer ( L -glycine 3 M,
pH 8.5, 200 μL) and stirred at room temperature for 20 h. The
solid color became light pink. Finally, the mixture was filtered,
and the immobilized enzyme was washed with Milli-Q water
(3 × 1 mL) and activity assay buffer (AcONa 200 mM + PLP
0.2 mM, pH 5 for LbTDC and KPi 50 mM + PLP 0.1 mM, pH
8 for TsRTA, 3 × 1 mL). The immobilized enzyme activity was
tested.
Immobilization on HAP-GLYMO. HAP-GLYMO (20
mg) was suspended in an enzyme solution (different protein
concentrations in KPi 50 mM, pH 8, 400 μL; see Figure S14).
The reaction was mixed at room temperature for 24 h. Then
the mixture was filtered, and the solid was washed with activity
assay buffer (AcONa 200 mM + PLP 0.2 mM, pH 5 for
LbTDC and KPi 50 mM + PLP 0.1 mM, pH 8 for TsRTA, 2 ×
400 μL). The protein concentration in both filtrate and
washing was measured via Bradford assay, and the activity of
the immobilized enzyme was tested.
Calculation of Immobilization Parameters. The per-
centage immobilization yield (IY) was calculated with the
following equation

Reusability of Immobilized LbTDC and TsRTA. In order
to measure the reusability of immobilized LbTDC and TsRTA,
multiple consecutive activity assays were performed as
described above. Between one reaction and the following
one, the supernatant was removed either by filtration under
reduced pressure or using a Pasteur pipette, and the
immobilized enzyme was washed with the activity assay buffer
(AcONa 200 mM + PLP 0.2 mM, pH 5, 2 × 1 mL for LbTDC
and KPi 50 mM + PLP 0.1 mM, pH 8, 3 × 3 mL for TsRTA).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
CiVCPO Immobilization. Computational analyses of
CiVCPO superficial residues composition showed that 4.72%
of the total surface area of the protein was made of lysines (i.e.,
11 residues) that can be used for its immobilization (Figure 1).
Different protein loadings were tested as shown in Table 1
but, despite reaching always high immobilization yield,
comparable to the ones previously reported in literature with
commercially available supports,
9
the recovered activity of the
immobilized enzyme always resulted in low values that
decreased with higher protein loading.
Although the decrease of recovered activity with the increase
of protein loading is a common phenomenon in enzyme
immobilization, in this case, this resulted in very poor
immobilized activity, with values that never exceeded 0.2 U/
g
support
. CiVCPO was, therefore, not pursued further. Of course,
we cannot exclude that a different immobilization strategy, e.g.,
the pretreatment of the enzyme with polyethylenimine and
glutaraldehyde, could lead to better recovered activities;
however, for consistency within our experimental approach,
we did not explore further options.
LbTDC Immobilization on Derivatized HAP. LbTDC,
which also has been already immobilized on conventional
support such as EP403/S, HFA403/S, and EP400/SS,
10
was
then investigated. In order to have results comparable to the
ones reported in the literature, multiple immobilization
approaches were trialed, namely, HAP-APTES-GA, used
above with CiVCPO, HAP-GLYMO + Co(II) as reported in
the literature, and HAP-GLYMO which exploits epoxy groups
on the HAP for the direct immobilization with the lysine
residues of the enzyme. (3-Glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane
(GLYMO) was used in the last two strategies to derivatize
hydroxyapatite.
All strategies rely on lysine residues on the enzyme surface
for immobilization chemistry. As shown in Figure 2, LbTDC
surface is very rich in lysine residues (69), accounting for
14.68% of the total area.
LbTDC can be immobilized in high yields with all three
strategies (Table 2) with peaks up to 94% when glutaraldehyde
is employed. However, recovered activities reached a
maximum of ∼17% and only at a low catalyst loading and
low immobilization yield. With the GLYMO strategies,
immobilization yields varied between ∼50 and ∼90%, but
the recovered activity was less satisfactory, never exceeding 4%.
While both HAP-APTES-GA and HAP-GLYMO gave at least
measurable activities, they were lower than those reported in
the literature with other supports.
TsRTA Immobilization. Finally, our focus shifted to
TsRTA. The stereoselective synthesis of amine remains a key

and was therefore tested as a possible enzyme to be
immobilized on HAP. The same three approaches used for
LbTDC were used with TsRTA, which displays a lower content
in superficial lysine residues, i.e., 30 lysines corresponding to
9.02% of the total surface of the dimer (Figure 3). The
obtained results are summarized in Table 3.
As it can be noted, the strategy that makes use of
glutaraldehyde allowed the achievement of high immobiliza-

other hand, it was not possible to obtain reproducible results
using the GLYMO linker: only sometimes was it possible to
achieve some immobilization exploiting the Co activation
strategy, but the yields were always quite low, and therefore the
recovered activities were not measured.
Reusability of Immobilized LbTDC and TsRTA. One of
the main goals pursued through enzyme immobilization is the
possibility of reusing the biocatalyst in multiple reaction cycles.
Therefore, following the screening of the different immobiliza-
tion strategies, both LbTDC and TsRTA immobilized via
APTES and glutaraldehyde, with a catalyst loading of 3 and 5
mg/g, respectively, were tested in multiple reaction cycles
using their activity assay as model reactions. As reported in
Figure 4, the immobilized activity of both enzymes showed a
remarkable stability over six consecutive reactions, demonstrat-
ing that in all cases, once the enzyme is successfully
immobilized, HAP is highly reliable with this strategy. A
reduction step was not performed following cross-linking. In
fact, the presence of the catalytic lysine, both LbTDC and
TsRTA, which is bound to PLP in the resting state via a Schiff
base, is incompatible with the reduction step. It is worth
mentioning that despite this being a practice routinely applied
(including in our group with suitable enzyme candidates),
there is little evidence that such reduction improves the
immobilized enzyme stability, and many different reaction
mechanisms have been suggested over the years that do not
imply the formation of a Schiff base.

CONCLUSIONS
In this work, the possibility of using hydroxyapatite as a
support for covalent immobilization of three different enzymes
was studied. Using APTES to functionalize the pristine support
and glutaraldehyde as a linker, it was possible to immobilize all
of the enzymes chosen with good immobilization yield.
However, CiVCPO presented a very low immobilized activity,
while both LbTDC and TsRTA retained good activity upon
immobilization, and it was possible to reuse them in six
consecutive reactions with almost no deactivation.
On the other hand, the strategies that exploited GLYMO as
a linker led to diverse results depending on the enzyme: in fact,
LbTDC was immobilized with comparable yield and recovered
activity when a direct addition on the epoxide of the linker was
performed, while both parameters gave lower values when the
activation with cobalt(II) ions was used. Instead, it was not
possible to achieve decent immobilization of TsRTA by
exploiting GLYMO as a linker, neither through direct addition
nor through cobalt(II) activation.
