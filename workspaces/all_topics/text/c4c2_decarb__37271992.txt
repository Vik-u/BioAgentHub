ABSTRACT
JUJUNCAO (Cenchrus fungigraminus; 2n = 4x = 28) is aCenchrus grass with the highest biomass produc-
tion among cultivated plants, and it can be used for mushroom cultivation, animal feed, and biofuel produc-
tion. Here, we report a nearly complete genome assembly of JUJUNCAO and reveal that JUJUNCAO is an
allopolyploid that originated/C242.7 million years ago (mya). Its genome consists of two subgenomes, and
subgenome A shares high collinear synteny with pearl millet. We also investigated the genome evolution
of JUJUNCAO and suggest that the ancestral karyotype ofCenchrus split into the A and B ancestral karyo-
types of JUJUNCAO. Comparative transcriptome and DNA methylome analyses revealed functional diver-
gence of homeologous gene pairs between the two subgenomes, which was a further indication of asym-
metric DNA methylation. The three types of centromeric repeat in the JUJUNCAO genome (CEN137,
CEN148, andCEN156) may have evolved independently within each subgenome, with some introgressions
of CEN156 from the B to the A subgenome. We investigated the photosynthetic characteristics of JUJUN-
CAO, revealing its typical C4 Kranz anatomy and high photosynthetic efﬁciency. NADP-ME and PEPCK
appear to cooperate in the major C4 decarboxylation reaction of JUJUNCAO, which is different from other
C4 photosynthetic subtypes and may contribute to its high photosynthetic efﬁciency and biomass yield.
Taken together, our results provide insights into the highly efﬁcient photosynthetic mechanism of JUJUN-
CAO and provide a valuable reference genome for future genetic and evolutionary studies, as well as ge-
netic improvement ofCenchrus grasses.

INTRODUCTION
Cenchrus is a widespread genus of the Poaceae family.Cenchrus
grasses are C4 plants characterized by high photosynthetic efﬁ-
ciency, massive biomass production, and high stress tolerance.
Most species are important for animal forage, cultivation material
for edible and medicinal mushrooms (so called JUNCAO菌草),
and biofuel production. JUJUCNAO (Cenchrus fungigraminus;
named JUJUNCAO for giant JUNCAO, 巨菌草; Supplemental
Figure 1) is the most productive Cenchrus species, with an
average height of/C244.0 m and a green-matter yield of/C24400 ton/
ha annually (Lin, 2013; Lin et al., 2022), which is about twice
that of the two elephant grasses Cenchrus purpureus (Yan
et al., 2020) and Pennisetum purpureum (Zhang et al., 2022b)
and other high-biomass C4 grasses (Mullet, 2017). JUJUNCAO
is able to grow in arid and semi-arid regions as well as ecologi-
cally fragile areas (Lin, 2013; Xu et al., 2014; He et al., 2017;
Hayat et al., 2020; Jia et al., 2020). Cultivation of Cenchrus
grasses such as JUJUNCAO is one of the most efﬁcient
strategies for using marginal land that is not optimal for
traditional crops and satisfying increasing demands for food,
including meat, milk, and mushrooms (Samson et al., 2005; Lin,
2013; Eisler et al., 2014; Gu et al., 2019; Xie and Xu, 2019;
Kuang et al., 2022).
JUJUNCAO is morphologically similar to anotherCenchrus grass
cultivar (P. purpureum3 Pennisetum americanumcv. Reyan No.
4), which is a triploid offspring of elephant grass (Luo et al., 2016).
JUJUNCAO can be distinguished from otherCenchrus grasses
by its stem, leaf, ﬂower, or color phenotypes (Lin et al., 2022).
These other species include pearl millet (Cenchrus americanus;
syn. Pennisetum glaucum)( Varshney et al., 2017), C. purpureus
(Yan et al., 2020) andP. purpureum(Zhang et al., 2022b), three
grasses with assembled genome sequences. Although many
efforts have been made to decipher the molecular biology of
JUJUNCAO (Lin et al., 2015; Ye et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2015;
Chen et al., 2016; Li et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2021), little is
known about the molecular basis of its agronomic traits and
evolutionary trajectory, owing to the lack of a high-quality refer-
ence genome.
Polyploidization is an important evolutionary force in angio-
sperm plants and provides diverse genetic resources to
beneﬁt the domestication of crops ( Adams and Wendel,
2005; Soltis et al., 2009). Polyploidization may also result in
high sequence similarity between homologous/homeologous
chromosomes and thus in frequent rearrangements between
these chromosomes ( Wendel et al., 2016 ), a feature that
poses major challenges in genomic biology, such as
deciphering the architecture of telomeres and centromeres.
Centromeres are essential for genome integrity because they
mediate the junction between sister chromatids and the
proper separation of chromosomes during mitosis and
meiosis (Liu et al., 2020b). Plant centromeres often consist of
satellite arrays interrupted by long terminal repeat (LTR)
retrotransposons ( Zhong et al., 2002 ; Hall et al., 2004 ;
Comai et al., 2017 ), making it challenging to understand
centromere structure. Assembly of a highly contiguous
genome is therefore essential for resolving centromere
structure and mechanisms of chromosome fusion and ﬁssion
in the allotetraploid JUJUNCAO.
Recent advances in DNA sequencing technology and assembly
methodology have enabled gapless, telomere-to-telomere (T2T)
chromosome/genome assemblies for human cells (Nurk et al.,
2022), barley (Navra´ tilova´ et al., 2022), banana (Belser et al.,
2021), and maize (Liu et al., 2020a), which enable in-depth
investigation of the structure and evolutionary trajectory of
chromosomes, especially in regions with complex repetitive
sequences such as telomeres and centromeres. Here, we gener-
ated a T2T gapless genome of the allotetraploid JUJUNCAO, per-
formed bisulﬁte whole-genome sequencing, and analyzed its
genome evolution and the genomic basis of its C
4 characteristics.
These results provide insights into the evolution of JUJUNCAO,
particularly its centromere architecture, and the molecular b
asis of its high photosynthetic efﬁciency.
RESULTS
Assembly of a T2T genome of JUJUNCAO
To decipher the genome structure of JUJUNCAO, we ﬁrst esti-
mated its genome size to be 2.05–2.09 Gb ( Supplemental
Table 1) using ﬂow cytometry analysis (Dolezel and Bartos,
2005). A total of 120 Gb (/C24603 coverage of the estimated
genome size) of PacBio long high-ﬁdelity (HiFi) circular
consensus sequencing (CCS) data were generated and assem-
bled into 2.13 Gb of contigs using the Hiﬁasm assembler
(Cheng et al., 2021). A ﬁnal total of 116 contigs were obtained
after removal of 145 Mb of heterozygous sequences, resulting
in a total assembly size of 1.99 Gb, with 1.97 Gb (/C2499.0%)
anchored into 14 pseudo-chromosomes based on Hi-C data
(Figure 1; Supplemental Figure 2; Table 1 and Supplemental
Table 2). The assembled JUJUNCAO genome contains 24 anno-
tated telomeres and 13 T2T chromosomes, eight of which are
gap-free (Chr2B, 3A, 3B, 4B, 5A, 5B, 6A, and 7A), four of which
have only one gap (Chr1B, 2A, 6B, and 7B), and one of which
(Chr4A) has three gaps at the telomeric region of the short arm
(Supplemental Figure 2C).
We used benchmarking universal single-copy orthologs (BUSCO;
Simao et al., 2015) and the LTR retrotransposon assembly index
(LAI; Ou et al., 2018) to assess the completeness and contiguity
of the assembly. The total complete BUSCO score was 98.4%,
and the LAI of the JUJUNCAO assembly was 15.9 (Table 1and
Supplemental Tables 3and 4).
Genome annotation
We predicted 68 562 gene models usingab initiogene prediction
and homology-based methods. Subgenomes A and B harbor
34 630 and 33 779 genes, respectively. BUSCO (v5.4.1) analysis
was performed to evaluate the gene annotations (Simao et al.,
2015), and 93.0% of the conserved genes from the BUSCO data-
base were present in the JUJUNCAO genome (Table 1 and
Supplemental Tables 4and 5).
A total of 1.16 Gb of repeat sequences were found in the
JUJUNCAO genome, accounting for 68.87% of the assembly.
The total proportion of transposable elements (TEs) in
JUJUCAO was comparable to that inSorghum bicolor, higher
than that in Setaria italica and Panicum miliaceum, but lower
than that in Zea mays (Supplemental Figure 3; Supplemental
Table 6). We also investigated the LTR insertion times and

Plant Communications Genome assembly of JUJUNCAO
found a smaller wave of LTR bursts in JUJUNCAO at/C241.2 mya,
similar to that in Z. mays. By contrast, the other species
investigated, such as C. americanus, P. miliaceum, S. bicolor,
and S. italica , had a stronger LTR burst within 1 mya
(Supplemental Figure 3B). LTR retrotransposons were the most
abundant TEs in the JUJUNCAO genome, accounting for
35.69% of the genome, followed by unknown repeats (28.67%),
and DNA transposons occupied only 4.51% of the genome.
The Ty3/Gypsy superfamily was the most abundant type of LTR
retrotransposon, making up more than half of the retrotranspo-
sons and 22.40% of the JUJUNCAO genome (Supplemental
Figure 3C; Supplemental Table 6).
Disentangling the subgenomes
To further conﬁrm the chromosome phasing results, we identiﬁed
32 629 chromosome-speciﬁc 13-bp sequences (13-mers), which
clustered into two distinct groups, indicative of the two subge-
nomes in JUJUNCAO ( Figure 1 B and 1C). These results
are consistent with the allopolyploidy features revealed by

our karyotyping results (Supplemental Figure 2A; Zhu et al.,
2015). The average nucleotide identity of homologous regions
in the two subgenomes was 90.1%, and chromosome
rearrangements occurred frequently after the split of the
common ancestor of the two subgenomes (Figure 1C). Except
for Chr07A/Chr07B, in which large segment arrangements were
observed in the other six chromosome pairs, subgenome A of
JUJUNCAO exhibited highly conserved collinear synteny with
the genome of pearl millet, with 90.7% average nucleotide iden-
tity. By contrast, subgenome B of JUJUNCAO and the genome of
pearl millet showed more genome rearrangements and had
86.4% average nucleotide identity (Supplemental Figure 4).
Genome evolution
The near-T2T complete assembly enabled us to investigate the
evolution of the JUJUNCAO genome. To establish the timeline
of paleo-tetraploidy in JUJUNCAO, we performed inter- and
intra-subgenomic comparisons between JUJUNCAO and other
Panicoideae species using protein sequences of the primary
transcripts from 10 representative Panicoideae species (Sac-
charum spontaneum, Miscanthus sinensis, S. bicolor, Z. mays,
Panicum hallii , P. miliaceum , Panicum virgatum ,
C. americanus, S. italica, and Setaria viridis) and the outgroup
species Oryza sativa (Figure 2 A). Our results showed
that JUJUNCAO diverged from S. italica, P. miliaceum, and
S. bicolor approximately 7.4 mya, 13.3 mya, and 21.1
mya, respectively ( Figure 2 A). The allotetraploid origin of
JUJUNCAO was estimated at/C242.7 mya based on the Ks value
of 0.039.
We then traced the evolutionary trajectory of JUJUNCAO and
representative species from different genera of Panicoideae,
including Z. mays, S. bicolor, Echinochloa haploclada, Digitaria
exilis, P. miliaceum , P. hallii , and S. italica (Supplemental
Figure 5 ). According to the number and structure of
chromosomes in these species, we inferred that the Paniceae
ancestor originated at/C2415.1 mya and had nine chromosomes.
Most of the Paniceae species evolved from the ancestral
grass karyotype (AGK) through 10–18 chromosome
rearrangement events, including fusions and ﬁssures. For
example, E. haploclada evolved with the fewest chromosomal
rearrangement events (four fusions and six ﬁssures) and most
closely resembled the AGK. Ancestors of JUJUNCAO subge-
nomes A and B are estimated to have diverged/C245.5 mya from
Cenchrus ancestors, following the divergence of Setaria and
Cenchrus at /C248.1 mya (Figure 2B and Supplemental Figure 5).
Our results showed that each of the two JUJUNCAO
subgenomes contained one chromosome (Chr6A and Chr4B)
that resembled the AGK, suggesting that the two subgenomes
of JUJUNCAO may have evolved independently from the same
ancestral Cenchrus karyotype. Based on the chromosome syn-
teny of Paniceae species, we propose the ancestralCenchrus
karyotype (ACK) (Figure 2C; Supplemental Figure 6). Compared
with the ACK, 18 large rearrangements (eight ﬁssures and 10
fusions) were found in subgenome A and 12 large
rearrangements (ﬁve ﬁssures and seven fusions) in subgenome
B. We also found that JUJUNCAO andP. purpureum diverged
/C240.3 mya and displayed similar karyotypes compared with the
AGK, but the sequence similarity between homologous genes

differed among different chromosome pairs ( Supplemental
Figure 7).
Centromere architecture in JUJUNCAO
Achieving high contiguity of centromeres is one of the major chal-
lenges in T2T genome assembly. Here, the complete genome
enabled us to annotate the centromeres of all 14 chromosomes.
We identiﬁed three types of centromeric repeats with high
sequence similarity in the JUJUNCAO genome, CEN137,
CEN148,a n dCEN156, each composed of satellite repeats with
lengths of /C24137 bp, /C24148 bp, and /C24156 bp, respectively
(Supplemental Table 7). These satellite repeats shared high
sequence similarity and were relatively conserved among
Paniceae species (identity: 59%–98%) such asS. viridis, S. italica,
P. hallii,a n dPanicum capillare(Figure 3A). Among them,CEN156
showed the highest sequence similarity to centromeric monomers
from other species, whereasCEN137 and CEN148 showed 19-bp
and 8-bp deletions, respectively (Figure 3A).
We used a k-mer method to accurately locate the three similar
satellite repeats and found that they were distributed in distinct

patterns. CEN156 is the most abundant centromeric array in the
JUJUNCAO genome and is enriched on almost all chromosomes,
with the exception of Chr2A and Chr4A.CEN137 is enriched
mainly on chromosomes from subgenome A, and CEN148
is found speciﬁcally on Chr5B ( Figure 3 B). We performed
ﬂuorescence in situhybridization (FISH) to conﬁrm these results
in JUJUNCAO and the diploidP. americanumcultivar MZL using
probes generated from repeat-speciﬁc oligomers of the three
centromeric repeats. There were two strong signals representing
the Chr5B-speciﬁc localization ofCEN148 in JUJUNCAO, and
these were absent in MZL.CEN137 signals were present on 12
of the chromosomes of JUJUNCAO and MZL, with the strongest
signal on Chr5A. ForCEN156, there were 11 signals representing
six of the chromosomes of JUJUNCAO, and these were absent
in MZL. There were also weak signals for CEN156 in the
JUJUNCAO genome, some of which co-localized with that of
CEN137 (Figure 3C). Taken together, our results revealed high
sequence similarity and a distinct distribution pattern of the
three centromeric satellites identiﬁed in the JUJUNCAO genome.
The similarity in centromeric structure between the JUJUNCAO A
subgenome and the diploidP. americanumMZL genome suggest
that they are derived from common A ancestral chromosomes
(Figure 2C).
Expression bias of homeologous gene pairs
Polyploidization may cause expression bias between homeolo-
gous gene pairs (Yang et al., 2016; Liang and Schnable, 2018).
To investigate homeolog expression bias in allotetraploid
JUJUNCAO, we deﬁned 22 260 homoeologous gene pairs be-
tween the A and B subgenomes. Comparative transcriptome
analysis using RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data generated from
leaves, stems, and roots showed that A-subgenome genes
are expressed at a slightly lower level than those of the B
subgenome, but there is no major overall bias for one
subgenome ( Figure 4 A and Supplemental Figure 8 ). We
identiﬁed 5668 and 5708 expression-biased genes in subge-
nomes A and B, respectively (Figure 4B). Subgenome B–biased
homeologs were enriched in Chr1B, the subtelomeric region of
the long arm of Chr4B, and the subtelomeric region of the short
arms of Chr5B and Chr6B. Subgenome A–biased homeologs
were enriched in Chr1A, the centromere proximal region, and
the short arm of Chr7A (Supplemental Figure 9). In total, 1124
differentially expressed homeologous gene pairs (DEHGs) were
identiﬁed: 557 showed subgenome-A bias and 567 showed sub-
genome-B bias. Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of
Genes and Genomes (KEGG) functional classiﬁcation showed
that DEHGs from the two subgenomes were enriched in different
metabolism, biosynthesis, and signaling pathways in roots,
stems, and leaves. Carboxylic acid biosynthesis, RNA metabolic
process, and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)-signaling
pathways were speciﬁcally enriched in subgenome A–biased
DEHGs, whereas hydrogen peroxide metabolic process,
response to oxidative stress, and AMPK-signaling pathways
were enriched in subgenome B–biased DEHGs (Supplemental
Figures 10 and 11). These results revealed functional
divergence between the two subgenomes of JUJUNCAO.
DNA methylation of homeologous gene pairs
Allele-speciﬁc DNA methylation is one of the mechanisms associ-
ated with expression bias of homeologs in allopolyploid plants
(Edger et al., 2017; Bird et al., 2021). To investigate whether the
expression bias of homeologous gene pairs in JUJUNCAO was
determined by DNA methylation, we performed high-throughput
bisulﬁte sequencing using libraries generated from leaves, stems,
and roots, with a genome coverage of about 303 and a cytosine
depth ranging from 15.1 3 to 19.1 3 in the three tissues
(Supplemental Table 8). On average, about 67% of the reads
generated from JUJUNCAO tissues could be mapped to the
assembled genome, and the de-repetitive retention rate was
/C2475% (Supplemental Table 9). The percentage methylation of
CG, CHG, and CHH contexts was highest in roots (73.3%, 53%,
and 2.4%, respectively), followed by stems (63.5%, 47.2%, and
2.3%) and leaves (63.0%, 44.3%, and 2.1%; Supplemental
Table 10). Cytosine methylation was mainly enriched in regions
around centromeres, although the methylation patterns of
centromeres differed from each other. These results are
consistent with the hypermethylation of repetitive sequences
(Supplemental Figure 12).
We next compared overall DNA methylation patterns between the
two subgenomes in the examined tissues. In upstream and
downstream regions, methylation of all CG, CHG, and CHH con-
texts was signiﬁcantly higher in subgenome B than in subgenome
A for leaves (p < 1.9e/C005) and stems (p < 0.037) (Supplemental
Figure 13 ). In the gene body, only CHH methylation was
signiﬁcantly higher in subgenome B than in subgenome A for all
tissues (p <8.5e /C005). To further explore the association
between DNA methylation and gene expression, we compared
DNA methylation patterns of subgenome-biased genes and
found that CG and CHG methylation rates in the gene body
were signiﬁcantly lower in subgenome-biased genes (whose
expression was more than twice that of their homeologs) than
in their subgenome homeologs. By contrast, CHH methylation
showed the opposite pattern in the three tissues. We found no
signiﬁcant differences in methylation of gene pairs that showed
a lower level of differential expression (0–2 fold change), with
the exception of CHH methylation in leaves (p =
0.0084) (Figure 4C–4E, Supplemental Figures 14and 15).
C4 photosynthetic characteristics of JUJUNCAO
To explore the C4 photosynthesis features of JUJUNCAO, we ﬁrst
performed a histological analysis and demonstrated that JUJUN-
CAO has typical Kranz anatomy, with two mesophyll (M) cells
separated by consecutive enlarged bundle sheaths (BS) (BS-M-
M-BS) (Figure 5A), similar to other C
4 plants such as maize and
sugarcane ( Langdale, 2011 ; Sage et al., 2014 ). We next
investigated the photosynthetic response of JUJUNCAO to light
and CO2 concentration. At 400 mmol mol/C01 CO2, JUJUNCAO

had a light saturation point (LSP) near 2000 mmol mol /C01
(Figure 5B) and a light-saturated net CO2 assimilation rate (A) of
40 mmol m/C02 s/C01. The apparent quantum yield (AQY) was 0.07,
the light compensation point (LCP) was 51.97 mmol photons
m/C02 s/C01, and the Amax was 46.58mmol m/C02 s/C01 (Figure 5B).
Investigation of the primary method of carbon ﬁxation in
JUJUNCAO showed that at a light intensity of 2000mmol photons
m/C02 s/C01, the CO2 response curve with a low CO2 compensation
point (154mmol mol/C01) presents a steep slope typical of C4 spe-
cies (Figure 5C) (Sage et al., 2014). After ﬁtting, the maximal PEP
carboxylation activity (Vpmax) was 115.30mmol m/C02 s/C01, and the
maximal Rubisco activity (Vcmax) was 51.25 mmol m/C02 s/C01
(Figure 5C). These results conﬁrmed that JUJUNCAO is a C4
grass.

Genome assembly of JUJUNCAO Plant Communications
(Supplemental Figure 16 ; Supplemental Table 11 ). The
JUJUNCAO genome contained 44 putative genes involved in
the C
4 carbon ﬁxation module, including those encoding the
key enzymes carbonic anhydrase (CA), NAD-malic enzyme
(NAD-ME), NADP-malate dehydrogenase (NADP-MDH), NADP-
malic enzyme (NADP-ME), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase
(PEPC), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), PEPC ki-
nase (PEPC-k), pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK), and
PPDK regulatory protein (PPDK-RP). These genes were evenly
distributed in the two subgenomes (Supplemental Table 11). To
further investigate the photosynthetic and diel expression
patterns of C
4 pathway genes, we collected RNA-seq samples
at 08:00 h, 14:00 h, and 22:00 h from the immature zone (base),
transition-zone (middle), and mature zone (tip) of ﬁeld-grown
JUJUNCAO leaves (Figure 5D and 5E). In the gradient leaf
tissues, we were able to distinguish gene family members
involved in carbon ﬁxation from non-C
4-related genes
involved in other processes. Eight of the putative C4 pathway
genes, namely CfCA1, CfPEPC1, CfPEPC-k2, CfNADP-
MDH2, CfNADP-ME2, CfPEPCK, CfPPDK1, and CfPPDK-RP1,
displayed the expected expression pattern of genes involved in
photosynthesis: their expression increased from the leaf base
to the tip (Li et al., 2010), and they had a diurnal expression
pattern in the mature zone, with little or no expression in the
immature zone (Figure 5D and 5E). In addition, expression of
these genes was higher in leaves than in stems and roots
(Supplemental Figure 17). These results suggested that these
eight genes are related to C
4 photosynthesis in JUJUNCAO.
Notably, CfPEPC-k2 displayed a C 4 expression pattern in
JUJUNCAO leaves but was clustered with non-C4 genes of sug-
arcane, maize, and sorghum (Figure 5D and 5E;Supplemental
Figure 17 ). In the daytime, expression of CfPEPC-k2 and
CfPPDK-RP1 increased from 08:00 h to 14:00 h (Figure 5E), a
pattern opposite to that of the other C4 genes. These results
indicated that a neofunctionalization of these two genes
occurred in JUJUNCAO after its divergence from other Poaceae
species.
The genesCfPEPC-k2, CfPPDK-RP1, andCfCA1 in the A and B
subgenomes were differentially expressed at different time points
(Figure 5D). CfCA1 and CfPPDK-RP1 in subgenome B (CfCA1_B
and CfPPDK-RP1_B) displayed enhanced expression (>2.75-
fold) in leaves compared with those of subgenome A (CfCA1_A
and CfPPDK-RP1_A), and expression ofCfPEPC-k2 was 2.88-
fold higher in subgenome A (CfPEPC-k2_A) than in subgenome
B( CfPEPC-k2_B)( Supplemental Figure 17). To investigate the
potential inﬂuence of gene methylation on gene expression, we
examined differences in CG, CHG, and CHH methylation in the
2-kb upstream region, 5
0 untranslated region (UTR), exon
region, intron region, 30 UTR, and 2-kb downstream region of
these three genes. CfPEPC-k2, CfPPDK-RP1, and CfCA1 in
subgenomes A and B had different methylation levels in the
three methylation contexts (Figure 5F). CfCA1_B and CfPPDK-
RP1_B had higher CG methylation levels in the intron region
than CfCA1_A and CfPPDK-RP1_A. In addition,CfCA1_A, with
a signiﬁcantly longer 5
0 UTR, contained high CG, CHG, and
CHH methylation levels (Figure 5F). By contrast,CfPEPC-k2_A
had the lowest CG methylation levels in the intron region. CG,
CHG, and CHH methylation levels were lower inCfPEPC-k2_A
than inCfPEPC-k2_B.
C4 decarboxylation is mainly dependent on NADP-ME
with the cooperation of PEPCK
There are three subtypes of C4 plants, each of which utilizes one
of the major decarboxylating enzymes: NADP-ME, NAD-ME, and
PEPCK (Maier et al., 2011). Comparative transcriptome analysis
revealed that genes encoding NADP-ME (CfNADP-ME2) and
PEPCK (CfPEPCK) showed comparable expression levels during
the daytime (Figure 5D and 5E); the TPM ofCfNADP-ME2_A and
CfNADP-ME2_B was 648 and 965, respectively, and that of
CfPEPCK1_A and CfPEPCK1_B was 1060 and 799, indicative
of a consistent rhythmic trend between the two enzymes.
However, the NAD-ME genes CfNAD-ME1 and CfNAD-
ME2 showed a rhythmic trend opposite to that ofCfNADP-ME2
and CfPEPCK (Figure 5 E). Therefore, we speculated that
NADP-ME and PEPCK are the two major decarboxylating en-
zymes and contribute equally to the C
4 decarboxylation reaction
of JUJUNCAO, with NAD-ME acting in a complementary manner
to the two major enzymes.
Phylogenetic analysis ofCenchrus grasses
Although many Cenchrus grasses have been identiﬁed to
date, only a few genetic resources are available for them. To un-
derstand the phylogenetic relationships of other Cenchrus
grasses, we recently performed genome sequencing of 19Cen-
chrus grasses, including the Cenchrus cultivar Bajra, the
P. americanum cultivar MZL, elephant grass ( P. purpureum
(Schumach.), ZXC), RY4HWC (P. purpureum 3 P. americanum
cv. Reyan No. 4), ZJLWC (P. americanum 3 P. purpureum),

Plant Communications Genome assembly of JUJUNCAO
(DUOSUIXIANGCAO), HNXC (Huanan XIANGCAO), and HNDS
(Hainan DUOSUI) (Lin et al., 2022). Three S. italica varieties
(SRR13414290, SRR13414328, and SRR13414313) were used
as outgroups. These data comprise about 3.842 billion clean
reads (/C240.5 Tbp) (Supplemental Table S12). We aligned the
ﬁltered reads to the JUJUNCAO genome and used the GATK
pipeline for variant calling. A total of 149 319 SNPs shared by
all the tested grasses were used for principal-component anal-
ysis (PCA) and phylogenetic analysis. Both results clustered the
grasses into three clades: the threeS. italica varieties were an
outgroup, Bajra and MZL comprised group II, and JUJUNCAO
(C. fungigraminus) and the other grasses comprised group I.
This classiﬁcation also coincides with their matching rates
(Supplemental Figure 18; Supplemental Table S12). Our results
also demonstrated that the two species closely related to
JUJUNCAO are Bajra and MZL. We next estimated the popula-
tion dynamics ofCenchrus using the A and B subgenomes of
JUJUNCAO as ancestor genomes. The effective population of
the Cenchrus genus was estimated to be/C2410 000 at 0.1 kya
and more than 10 000 earlier. Our results demonstrated an abrupt
decrease in the population size ofCenchrus grasses between
200 and 400 kya in both simulations. An additional decrease in
population size at 20–50 kya was also observed using the B sub-
genome of JUJUNCAO as the ancestor genome. These results
suggested the elimination of large numbers ofCenchrus individ-
uals during the two stages, probably caused by extremely low
temperature.
DISCUSSION
A high-quality genome is very important for evolutionary and ge-
netic studies. Although genomes have been assembled for many
plant species, particularly economically important crops, only
recently have a few genomes with T2T chromosomes been pub-
lished. Here, we report a gapless, near-complete genome of the
high-biomass grass JUJUNCAO. The contig N50 is 134.1 Mb,
which is about 7000 times, 73 times, and 46 times that of pearl
millet (Varshney et al., 2017), C. purpureus (Yan et al., 2020),
and P. purpureum (Zhang et al., 2022b), respectively. To the
best of our knowledge, this assembly is the highest-quality
published Panicoideae genome. Because of the high biomass,
stress tolerance, and broad adaptation of JUJUNCAO, its
highly complete allopolyploid genome not only provides a high-
quality reference genome for aCenchrus grass but also serves
as a valuable genetic resource for studying the mechanisms
that underlie its robust performance and improving high-
biomass grasses.
Genome evolution
Using the near-complete assembly, we discriminated the two
subgenomes of JUJUNCAO and traced the evolutionary trajec-
tory of this paleo-tetraploid. Comparison of genome structures
revealed that the two subgenomes of JUJUCNAO were united
and doubled /C242.7 mya, much more recently than those of the
two allotetraploid elephant grasses C. purpureus (6.61 mya;
Yan et al., 2020) and P. purpureum Schum (15 mya; Zhang
et al., 2022b). We proposed the ACK and suggested that the
two subgenomes of JUJUNCAO evolved independently from
the same ACK. This conclusion differs from that of the previous
study by Zhang et al. (2022b), which suggested that after its
divergence from pearl millet, the ancestral A genome split into
the ancestors of the A
0 and B subgenomes of P. purpureum.
Frequent chromosomal rearrangements may have occurred
between the two subgenomes after the allotetraploidization of
JUJUNCAO. We found that subgenome A of JUJUNCAO is
much more closely related to the twoCenchrus cultivars Bajra
and MZL than to pearl millet (see also Lin et al., 2022 ).
However, our results also suggested that these twoCenchrus
cultivars are unlikely to be the parental species of JUJUNCAO.
The relatives of JUJUNCAO subgenome B and the two elephant
grasses remain unknown (Yan et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2022b),
and more Cenchrus species should be collected to resolve the
phylogenetic relationships within this genus.
Polyploids generally beneﬁt from whole-genome duplication that
combines complementary pathways to confer adaptive advan-
tages and robust agronomic performance. This has been attrib-
uted in part to subgenome-biased expression of homeologous
genes in polyploids, particularly allopolyploids ( Wang et al.,
2011; Bertioli et al., 2019). Consistent with previous studies,
subgenome-biased genes in JUJUNCAO demonstrated biolog-
ical functional divergence between the two subgenomes, which
was to some extent negatively associated with DNA methylation.
We inferred from these results that DNA methylation may lead to
divergent expression in the two subgenomes of JUJUNCAO,
which is thought to have occurred after the divergence of the
two subgenomes.
Centromere evolution
Centromeres in many plants and animals are often composed of
a single satellite repeat, typically with a length ranging from
150 bp to 180 bp ( Jiang et al., 2003 ; Yang et al., 2018 ).
Although the function of centromeres is highly conserved
among different species, the centromeric satellites are highly
variable, and changes in sequences can be detected within
and among species and even among different chromosomes
(Cheng et al., 2002 ; Hall et al., 2003 ; Zhang et al., 2014 ;
Presting, 2018; Yang et al., 2018; Ahmad et al., 2020). In this
study, we revealed the dynamic architecture and evolution of
JUJUNCAO centromeres and suggested that centromeric satel-
lite repeats were conserved in Paniceae. Among the three
centromeric satellite repeats identiﬁed in the JUJUNCAO
genome, CEN156 shared the highest similarity with homologs
from closely related species and was thought to be the founding
sequence of ancestralCenchrus chromosomes. It diverged into
CEN137 in the common ancestral genome of subgenome A and
P. americanum MZL and into CEN148 in the ancestral subge-
nome B after the divergence of the ancestral A and B subge-
nomes of JUJUNCAO. The subgenome A–speciﬁc CEN137
and subgenome B–speciﬁc CEN148 suggest that the three
types of satellite repeats evolved independently within the two
subgenomes. However, introgressions ofCEN156 from subge-
nome B into subgenome A may have occurred after the
paleo-polyploidization of the JUJUNCAO genome. This would
be a reasonable explanation for the presence ofCEN156 in sub-
genome A of JUJUNCAO and its absence from the genome of
the diploidP. americanumMZL, which is phylogenetically close
to subgenome A of JUJUNCAO. We also examined overall DNA
methylation patterns in the centromeric regions and showed
enrichment of cytosine methylation in the peri/centromeric
Plant Communications 4, 100633, September 11 2023ª 2023 The Author(s). 11
Genome assembly of JUJUNCAO Plant Communications
regions, with different segments in different centromeres or the
same centromere being either hypomethylated or hypermethy-
lated. These results were consistent with those reported for
other plants such as rice (Yan et al., 2010), Arabidopsis, and
maize (Zhang et al., 2008; Koo and Jiang, 2011).
Mechanisms underlying high photosynthetic efﬁciency
C4 plants are among the most productive and efﬁcient biomass
producers. ThePennisetum grasses were identiﬁed as C4 plants
decades ago on the basis of their low compensation point and
Kranz anatomy (Coombs and Baldry, 1972 ; Coombs et al.,
1973a, 1973c, 1973b; Huber and Sankhla, 1973). C
4 plants are
classically grouped into three biochemical subtypes according
to whether they contain high levels of NADP-ME, PEPCK, or
NAD-ME for decarboxylation of C
4 acids (malate and/or aspar-
tate) (Dengler and Nelson, 1999; Edwards and Voznesenskaya,
2011). Like otherPennisetum grasses, JUJUNCAO is also a C4
plant, with anatomical and physiological adaptations that opti-
mize CO2 ﬁxation. The centrifugal chloroplast arrangement of
bundle sheath cells observed in JUJUNCAO was consistent
with that of classic NADP-ME species such as sugarcane and
maize ( Sage et al., 2014 ) but different from the evenly
distributed pattern of P. purpureum, which is typical of the
PEPCK subtype. The anatomical variation between
P. purpureum and JUJUNCAO could be inﬂuenced by environ-
mental factors, such as light ( Sales et al., 2018). Currently,
Pennisetum grasses such as P. purpureum, P. americanum,
and Pennisetum setaceumare classiﬁed as the NADP-ME sub-
type (Neto and Guerra, 2019). Many studies have suggested
that more than one decarboxylation enzyme may co-exist in a
single C
4 plant; that the PEPCK pathway could be complemen-
tary in NADP-ME subtype species such as sugarcane, maize,
and sorghum; and that the contribution of PEPCK to total decar-
boxylase activity was lower than that of NADP-ME and differed
among species ( Wang et al., 2014 ). Both NADP-ME and
PEPCK enzymes may also be present inPennisetum grasses
(P. purpureum), owing to their use of malate and/or aspartate
as the C
4 translocated acid ( Coombs et al., 1973c ).
Interestingly, JUJUNCAO CfPEPCK reached a transcript level
comparable to that of CfNADP-ME. This is similar to results
from sugarcane, which is categorized as an NADP-ME species,
although PEPCK transcript abundance was higher than that of
NADP-ME when measured by the serial analysis of gene expres-
sion (SAGE) technique (Calsa and Figueira, 2007). The rise in
PEPCK activity can be modulated by various environmental fac-
tors (Furbank, 2011; Sales et al., 2018) such as shading and
limited water supply (Sales et al., 2018; Cacefo et al., 2019).
Therefore, we propose that high CfPEPCK transcription may
potentially enable the maintenance of greater photosynthetic
efﬁciency in regions where JUJUNCAO thrives.
Allopolyploid-derived subgenomes begin with distinct, global dif-
ferences that would be expected to lead to global differences in
gene expression levels. We observed no expression bias in genes
encoding decarboxylases between the A and B subgenomes.
However, the C
4 genes CfCA1, CfPPDK-RP1, and CfPEPC-k2
showed some evidence of subgenome dominance, withCfCA1
and CfPPDK-RP1 exhibiting subgenome B dominance and
CfPEPC-k2 exhibiting subgenome A dominance. Subgenome
dominance led to divergence with respect to expression levels.
The accurate regulation of gene expression in the A and B subge-
nomes might be indispensable for allopolyploid plant develop-
ment, and DNA methylation may serve as a regulator of C
4
gene expression (Reeves et al., 2017). Higher CG methylation
levels in the intron region may confer higher expression of
CfCA1 and CfPPDK-RP1 from subgenome B, given that gene-
body methylation is positively correlated with gene expression
(Jones, 2012; Li et al., 2012). However, the transcript level of
CfPEPC-k2 was higher in subgenome A than in subgenome B.
DNA methylation can repress gene expression (Chan et al.,
2005). Thus, gene expression ofCfPEPC-k2 in subgenome B
might be repressed by DNA methylation of the downstream 2-
kb region. In this study, we found that the relationship between
gene expression and DNA methylation was complicated by genic
regions, methylation contexts, and subgenomes in the
allopolyploid.
METHODS
Plant materials and sequencing
The JUJUNCAO (C. fungigraminus,2n = 28) andC. americanus
plants used in this study were grown in the greenhouse at Fujian
Agriculture and Forestry University. For Illumina short-
read sequencing, genomic DNA extracted from leaf tissue was
used for construction of a 280-bp paired-end library with the
NEBNext Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit. The library was sequenced
using the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform. For PacBio HiFi library
construction and sequencing, the g-TUBE was used to shear
gDNA to/C2420-kb fragments for construction of SMRTbell libraries
using the SMRTbell Express Template Prep Kit 2.0. The libraries
were sequenced using the PacBio Sequel system at Novogene
Company. Hi-C libraries were generated and sequenced from
young leaves of JUJUCAO at Novogene as described previously
(Xie et al., 2015). In brief, after ﬁxation with formaldehyde, the
fresh leaves were lysed for DNA extraction. The cross-linked
DNA was digested overnight withMboI to generate sticky ends
for biotinylation and then proximity ligated to form chimeric junc-
tions. The enriched DNA was then physically sheared to a size of
200–600 bp. Chimeric fragments representing the original cross-
linked long-distance physical interactions were used to construct
paired-end sequencing libraries, which were sequenced using
the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (PE 125 bp).
Genome size estimation
Flow cytometry analysis was performed to estimate the C-value
of JUJUNCAO using fresh leaves, and tomato was used as a
reference genome control (Michaelson et al., 1991; Dolezel and
Bartos, 2005).
Genome assembly and scaffolding
About 117 Gb of clean PacBio CCS reads were used forde novo
assembly of the JUJUNCAO genome with default settings of Hi-
ﬁasm v0.16.1-r375 (Cheng et al., 2021), and the primary output
contigs with long stretches of phased blocks were sent to
NextPolish v1.3.1 (Hu et al., 2020) for polishing using Illumina
short reads. Purge_haplotigs v1.1.1 (Roach et al., 2018) was
used to remove heterozygous redundant sequences with the
parameters ‘‘purge_haplotigs contigcov -l 10 -m 80 -h 190.’’
The total span of the ﬁnal ﬁltered assembly was
1 986 757 443 bp in 116 contigs with a contig N50 size of
12 Plant Communications 4, 100633, September 11 2023ª 2023 The Author(s).
Plant Communications Genome assembly of JUJUNCAO
134 074 806 bp. To build a chromosome-level assembly, a Hi-C
library was constructed and sequenced as described previously
(Zhang et al., 2022a). A total of 233 Gb of Hi-C reads were
mapped to the contig-level assembly using BWA v0.7.17 with
default parameters (Li, 2013). We corrected the contig-level as-
sembly based on the chromatin contact signals. All of the cor-
rected contigs were remapped with Hi-C reads and reordered
and scaffolded using the ALLHiC pipeline (https://github.com/
tangerzhang/ALLHiC), and the resulting assembly was manually
corrected according to the visualization of chromatin contact pat-
terns. Finally, we generated a pseudo-chromosome assembled
genome that included 14 chromosomes.
Gene annotation
In brief, we integrated sequence homology,de novoprediction,
and transcriptome data to build consensus gene models using
the GETA pipeline (https://github.com/chenlianfu/geta). Protein
sequences from closely related grass species (C. americanus,
S. bicolor, and O. sativa) were used to perform homology-
based prediction. The GETA pipeline randomly selected 1000
homology-based genes to train AUGUSTUS v3.4.0 ( Stanke
et al., 2004) forde novo prediction on the pre-masked genome
sequences. We provided the pipeline with RNAs isolated from
root, stem, and leaf tissues of JUJUNCAO. To assemble the tran-
scriptomes, trimmomatic v0.39 (Bolger et al., 2014) was used
with default parameters to ﬁlter the RNA-seq reads. The ﬁltered
reads were aligned to the reference genome with HISAT2
v2.1.0 ( Kim et al., 2015 ). The reliable intron and optimal
transcript information were identiﬁed based on RNA-seq align-
ment. We next assembled and ﬁltered the transcripts with the
‘‘sam2transfrag’’ function in the GETA pipeline, which retains
the isoform of each gene with the highest RNA-seq read depth
as the representative transcript. Finally, gene models from these
three methods were integrated into a non-redundant high-conﬁ-
dence set of gene models.
Repeat sequence annotation
A repeat library of the JUJUNCAO genome was constructedab
initio using RepeatModeler v2.0.2 with a combination of de
novo and homology strategies, including twode novo repeat-
ﬁnding programs, RECON and RepeatScout, which we imported
into RepeatMasker v4.1.2 ( http://www.repeatmasker.org/) for
identiﬁcation and clustering of repetitive elements. We also inte-
grated results from LTR_FINDER ( Xu and Wang, 2007) and
LTRharvest (Ellinghaus et al., 2008) and removed false positives
from the initial predictions using the LTR_retriever pipeline (Ou
and Jiang, 2018) to obtain the ﬁnal full-length LTR-RTs.
Telomere and centromere detection
Tandem repeats were identiﬁed in the JUJUNCAO genome with
Tandem Repeat Finder v4.09 (TRF; parameters: 2 7 7 80 10 50
500 -m -f -d) (Benson, 1999), and the telomere and three types
of centromere sequences were found. To precisely investigate
the distributions of the three centromere repeat monomers
(CEN137, CEN148, CEN156), we divided the genome into
adjacent 5-kbp windows, deﬁned 12-mers, and exactly matched
these sequences to the window. For each region, we calculated
peak values of the distances between 13-mers to test for periodic
repeats. For example, if a window containedCEN137 repeats
(monomer size of 137 bp), the most frequent 13-mer
distance would be 137. We merged the same kind of windows,
and CEN137, CEN148, and CEN156 sequences were matched
back to corresponding windows using matchPattern (max.mis-
match = 3/peakvalues, with.indels = T) ( https://github.com/
Bioconductor/Biostrings). Finally, we identiﬁed 159 310 bp of
CEN137 repeats, 24 075 bp of CEN148 repeats, and
216 886 bp of CEN156 repeats in all 14 chromosomes, and
several were aligned by mafft.v 7.4 ( Katoh et al., 2009 )t o
generate the consensus sequence (Supplemental table 7).
Subgenome identiﬁcation
We resolved the JUJUNCAO genome into subgenomes A and B
using previously described methods (Session et al., 2016; Mitros
et al., 2020). First, homeologous chromosomes were determined
based on their conserved synteny to each other and to
C. americanus. Then, Jellyﬁsh v2.2.10 (Marc¸ ais and Kingsford,
2011) was used to scan 13-bp sequences (13-mers), and
32 629 subgenome-speciﬁc 13-mers were identiﬁed using the
following criteria: (1) occurred >1000 times across the genome,
and (2) were more than two-fold enriched in one member of
each homeologous chromosome pair (setting aside the fusion-
related chromosomes). These 13-mers could be clearly divided
into two groupings (A 13-mers and B 13-mers) by hierarchical
clustering. Similarly, chromosome clustering partitioned the
genome into subgenomes A and B.
Phylogenetic analysis, genomic comparison, and
divergence time estimation
Protein sequences of S. spontaneum, M. sinensis, S. bicolor,
Z. mays, P. hallii, P. miliaceum, P. virgatum, C. americanus,
C. fungigraminus, S. italica, S. viridis, and O. sativa were used
to identify gene family clusters with Orthoﬁnder v2.5.4. We
used the option ‘‘-M msa’’ to obtain maximum likelihood trees
from multiple sequence alignments. Divergence times were esti-
mated using r8s v1.81. Calibration times were obtained from the
TimeTree database (http://www.timetree.org/). Expansion and
contraction of Orthoﬁnder-derived gene clusters were deter-
mined using CAFE´ v4.2 (https://github.com/hahnlab/CAFE) and
were based on changes in gene family size in the inferred phylo-
genetic history. Collinearity between genomes was analyzed
using JCVI (https://github.com/tanghaibao/jcvi) with default pa-
rameters, and all orthologous and paralogous gene pairs
were identiﬁed on the basis of syntenic blocks. Paired synony-
mous substitution rates (Ks) were calculated using the Nei-
Gojobori method ( https://github.com/tanghaibao/bio-pipeline/
tree/master/synonymous_calculation).
Karyotype evolution analysis of Paniceae
The distribution of seven ancestral eudicot chromosomal line-
ages for each chromosome in each species was depicted by syn-
tenic blocks between the ancestral chromosomes of rice (Murat
et al., 2017) and those of the detected species.
SNP identiﬁcation and population genomics analysis
Paired-end raw reads were ﬁltered by removing reads with
adapters, reads with >10% N content, and reads with more
than 50% low-quality bases (Q% 5). Filtered paired-end reads
were mapped to the assembled JUJUNCAO genome using Bow-
tie2 v2.4.4 ( Langdon, 2015). We then used Picard (v1.129)
Plant Communications 4, 100633, September 11 2023ª 2023 The Author(s). 13
Genome assembly of JUJUNCAO Plant Communications
(https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard) to mark the duplicated
reads. SNPs were identiﬁed using the GATK toolkit v.3.5 (https://
github.com/broadinstitute/gatk) with the HaplotypeCaller mod-
ule. Next, we merged the GCVF ﬁles using the GenotypeGVCFs
tool in GATK to generate raw SNP ﬁles. The SNP ﬁlter application
VCFtools v0.1.13 (Danecek et al., 2011) was used with ‘‘–max-
missing 0.8 –maf 0.05 –max-alleles 2 –min-meanDP 4 –minQ
200.’’ Vcf2phylip software (https://github.com/edgardomortiz/
vcf2phylip) was used to convert the format, and RaxML v8.12
(Stamatakis, 2014) was used to construct a maximum likelihood
tree. PCA was performed using PLINK v1.90 (Purcell et al.,
2007) to transform the VCF ﬁle into a PLINK ﬁle for input.
Demographic analysis
To calculate the site-frequency spectrum (SFS) ofPennisetumpop-
ulations, we used the ‘‘-doSaf’’ parameter of ANGSD (Korneliussen
et al., 2014) to calculate the site allele frequency likelihood based on
individual genotype likelihoods assuming HWE from ﬁltered BAM
ﬁles. Then the ‘‘-realSFS’’ parameter was used to obtain a
maximum likelihood estimate of the SFS by an expectation
maximization (EM) algorithm. The folded SFS was used to
estimate population demographic history by stairway plots (Liu
and Fu, 2015) with 200 bootstrap iterations. We used 6.5e/C09a s
the mutation rate and a generation time of 1 year for the analysis.
Bisulﬁte whole-genome sequencing and bioinformatic
analysis
The JUJUNCAO reference genome and the clean reads gener-
ated from bisulﬁte sequencing were transformed into bisulﬁte-
converted sequences (C-to-T and G-to-A converted). The clean
reads were then aligned to the reference genome using
BISMARK with default parameters, and methylation information
was extracted using BISMARK_METHYLATION_EXTRACTOR
with the following options: –comprehensive –bedGraph –counts
–CX_context –cytosine_report. The methylation level of an indi-
vidual cytosine was calculated from the number of methylated
cytosines divided by the total cytosine depth (i.e., mC/(mC +
non-mC)). Only sites that covered more than three mapped reads
were used for subsequent analysis. Sites with more than one
methylated cytosine mapping were considered methylation sites.
FISH
FISH experiments were performed as described previously
(Huang et al., 2021). Oligomers speciﬁc for each centromeric
satellite repeat ( Supplemental Table 13 ) were designed
according to their sequence alignment results (Figure 3). The
oligomers were labeled via nick-translation using digoxigenin-
11-dUTP or biotin-16-dUTP (Roche Diagnostics). Digoxigenin-
labeled probes and biotin-labeled probes were detected using
rhodamine-conjugated anti-digoxigenin (Roche Diagnostics)
and Alexa Fluor 488 streptavidin (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc),
respectively. 4
0,6-Diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) was used to
stain the chromosomes. Images of the samples were captured
with an Olympus BX63 ﬂuorescence microscope using an
Olympus DP80 CCD camera (Olympus).
Histological analysis
One-centimeter strips were cut crosswise to the leaf and ﬁxed for
12 h in a solution of 50% ethanol, 5% acetic acid, and 37% form-
aldehyde at 4
/C14C. The strips were then processed in a series of
ethanol solutions for 1 h each (50%, 60%, 70%, 85%, 95%,
100%), followed by mixtures of xylene and ethanol for 30 min
each (25% xylene + 75% ethanol, 50% xylene + 50% ethanol,
25% ethanol + 75% xylene, 100% xylene) and ﬁnally parafﬁn
for 12 h. The tissue was then oriented in parafﬁn and sectioned
at 8 mm using a rotary microtome (Leica, RM2255). Tissue was
stained with 1% safranine and fast green solution and viewed un-
der a microscope (Leica, BX3-CBH).
Identiﬁcation of genes related to key characteristics of
JUJUNCAO
C4 pathway genesfrom sorghum andS. spontaneumwere used as
query sequences for Basic Local Alignment Search Tool
(BLASTP) searches against the predicted sequences of
JUJUNCAO. Sequences with E-value <1e/C05 were selected for
further analysis.
Phylogenetic analysis of C4 pathway genes
Based on protein sequence alignment, a phylogenetic tree of the
C4 pathway gene family was constructed by the neighbor-joining
(NJ) method. The tree was constructed using MEGAX (Kumar
et al., 2018 ) with the ‘‘pairwise deletion’’ option and the
‘‘Poisson correction’’ model, and the reliability of internal
branches was assessed using 1000 bootstrap replicates.
The results were imported into the interactive Tree of Life (iTOL)
(Letunic and Bork, 2016) to create the phylogenetic tree.
Gas exchange measurements
Leaf gas exchange was measured in the +1 leaf (the ﬁrst fully
expanded leaf from the top to bottom) using a portable infrared
gas analyzer (LI-COR 6800XT, LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). Mea-
surements were made at a leaf temperature of 30
/C14C, humidity
of 65%, and ﬂow rate of 500mmol s⁻1. The light-response curves
were made at a CO2 concentration of 400mmol mol⁻1 and photo-
synthetic photon ﬂux densities (PPFDs) of 2000, 1500, 1000, 800,
600, 400, 200, 150, 100, 75, 50, and 0mmol m⁻2 s⁻1. The Excel
sheet used for curve ﬁtting was downloaded from http://
landﬂux.org/tools.C O2 response curves were measured at a
PPFD of 2000 mmol m⁻2 s⁻1 and CO2 concentrations of 400,
300, 200, 120, 70, 40, 20, 0, 400, 400, 400, 600, 800, 1200, and
1500 mmol mol⁻1. The CO2 response curves were ﬁtted according
to von Caemmerer.
