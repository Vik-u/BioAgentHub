Abstract: Asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA and SDMA, respectively) are toxic,
non-proteinogenic amino acids formed by post-translational modiﬁcation and are uremic toxins
that inhibit nitric oxide (NO) production and play multifunctional roles in many human diseases.
Both ADMA and SDMA have emerged as strong predictors of cardiovascular events and death in
a range of illnesses. Major progress has been made in research on ADMA-lowering therapies in
animal studies; however, further studies are required to ﬁll the translational gap between animal
models and clinical trials in order to treat human diseases related to elevated ADMA/SDMA
levels. Here, we review the reported impacts of ADMA and SDMA on human health and disease,
focusing on the synthesis and metabolism of ADMA and SDMA; the pathophysiological roles of
these dimethylarginines; clinical conditions and animal models associated with elevated ADMA
and SDMA levels; and potential therapies against ADMA and SDMA. There is currently no speciﬁc
pharmacological therapy for lowering the levels and counteracting the deleterious effects of ADMA
and SDMA. A better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the impact of ADMA and SDMA
on a wide range of human diseases is essential to the development of speciﬁc therapies against
diseases related to ADMA and SDMA.

1. Introduction
The dimethylarginines, asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and symmetric dimethylarginine
(SDMA), were ﬁrst isolated from human urine in 1970 [1]. Among the guanidine compounds listed
as uremic toxins [ 2], ADMA and SDMA and have been increasingly recognized as putative toxic
non-proteinogenic amino acids in a wide range of human diseases over the past decades [3–11].
The biological relevance of ADMA as an endogenous inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase (NOS)
was ﬁrst described by Vallance et al. [ 3]. Although less attention has been paid to SDMA,
Bode-Boger et al. were the ﬁrst to report in vitro inhibitory effects of nitric oxide (NO) production
by SDMA [ 12]. Given that NO has pleiotropic bioactivities, it is not surprising that a variety of
important biological functions are regulated by ADMA and SDMA. Emerging clinical and experimental

evidence indicates that ADMA and SDMA are involved in the pathophysiology of endothelial
dysfunction [ 13], atherosclerosis [ 4], oxidative stress [ 14,15], inﬂammation [ 16,17], uremia [ 8],
apoptosis, [18], autophagy [19], and impaired immunological function [20].
This review provides an overview of potential pathophysiological roles for both ADMA and
SDMA in human health and disease, with emphasis on the synthesis and metabolism of ADMA and
SDMA, the pathophysiology of dimethylarginines, clinical conditions with elevated ADMA and SDMA
concentrations, and potential therapies to reduce ADMA and SDMA levels.
2. Synthesis and Metabolism of ADMA and SDMA
2.1. Synthesis of ADMA and SDMA
Non-proteinogenic amino acids are those not naturally encoded or found in the genetic code
of organisms. Some of them are formed by post-translational modiﬁcation of the side chains
of proteinogenic amino acids present in proteins. Protein-incorporated ADMA is formed by
post-translational methylation: two methyl groups are placed on one of the terminal nitrogen atoms
of the quanidino group of arginine in proteins by a family of protein arginine methyltransferases
(PRMTs) [21]. SDMA, with one methyl group positioned on each of the terminal guanidine nitrogens,
is a structural isomer of ADMA. To date, nine human PRMT genes have been cloned and PRMTs
are divided into enzymes with type I, type II, or type III activity. Type I PRMTs (PRMT-1, -3, -4, -6,
and -8) generate ADMA, whereas type II PRMTs (PRMT-5 and -9) produce SDMA. Although peptidyl
arginine deiminases (PADs) can block methylation of arginine residues within proteins by converting
them to citrulline [22], PADs are not demethylases. The ﬁrst arginine demethylase, JMJD6, has been
identiﬁed [23]; however, a direct role for JMJD6 in the demethylation of protein-incorporated ADMA
and SDMA has not been validated [24].
2.2. Metabolism of ADMA and SDMA
Free ADMA and SDMA are released following proteolysis. A healthy adult produces 60 mg
(~300 µmol) ADMA per day, of which approximately 20% is excreted in urine via the kidneys [ 25].
In contrast to ADMA, SDMA is present at only ~50% of the levels of ADMA and the elimination
of SDMA is largely dependent on urinary excretion. Free ADMA and SDMA share a common
transport process with L-arginine and as such can be moved into or out of cells via the cationic
amino acid transporter (CAT) family [ 26]. Circulating ADMA can hence be transported to major
organs such as the kidney, brain, and liver for enzymatic degradation. To date, three enzymes
have been reported to metabolize ADMA: dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-1 (DDAH-1)
and -2 (DDAH-2) as well as alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase 2 (AGXT2), among which DDAHs
metabolize ADMA to citrulline and dimethylamine. Similarly, ADMA can also be transaminated by
the enzyme AGXT2 to α-keto-δ-(NG,NG-dimethylguanidino) valeric acid (DMGV) [27]. Accordingly,
plasma and tissue ADMA levels are highly dependent on factors that affect the expression and activity
of DDAHs and AGXT2. Several mechanisms of inhibition of the expression and/or activity of DDAHs
have been described [ 28], including hyperglycemia [ 29], oxidative stress [ 30], and angiotensin II
administration [31]. Unlike DDAHs, AGXT2, a mitochondrial aminotransferase expressed primarily
in the kidney, can metabolize not only ADMA but also SDMA [ 27]. This AGXT2-mediated
pathway of dimethylarginine metabolism has, however, received relatively little attention and the
metabolic pathway of this mechanism is still poorly understood. Only one report has shown that
D-β-aminoisobutyric acid can inhibit Agxt2-mediated metabolism of ADMA and SDMA [32].
In addition to ADMA and SDMA, a third methylarginine residue—N G monomethyl-L-arginine
(NMMA)—is produced in mammals. Since the levels of NMMA are much lower than those of
ADMA and SDMA, very little information is available regarding its pathophysiological role in clinical
conditions, except that it can function as a NOS inhibitor [28]. The biochemical pathways related to the
synthesis and metabolism of SDMA and ADMA are illustrated in Figure 1.

to citrulline (yellow circle) by peptidylarginine deaminases (PADs), thereby blocking methylation on 
the arginine residue. Upon proteolytic cleavage of arginine‐methylated proteins, free ADMA and 
SDMA are released into the cytoplasm. ADMA and SDMA can be moved out of the cells via cationic 
amino acid transporter (CAT) and transported to other organs or excreted in urine. ADMA can be 
converted  to  L‐citrulline  and  dimethylamine  by  dimethylarginine  dimethylaminohydrolase‐1 
(DDAH‐1)  and ‐ 2  (DDAH‐2).  Alanine‐glyoxylate  aminotransferase  2  (AGXT2),  a  mitochondrial 
aminotransferase expressed primarily in the kidney, can metabolize ADMA as well as SDMA. ADMA 
can be transaminated by the enzyme AGXT2 to α‐keto‐δ‐(NG,NG‐dimethylguanidino) valeric acid 
(DMGV). 
2.3. Quantification of ADMA and SDMA 
Since ADMA and SDMA show a very narrow range of normal concentrations, high analytical 
precision is mandatory to distinguish between normal and slightly elevated concentrations [33]. So 
far,  analytical  techniques  for  the  quantification  of  ADMA  and  SDMA  levels  include  high‐
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [34], gas chromatography (GC)–mass spectrometry (MS) 
[35], liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (LC‐MS and LC‐MS/MS) [36,37], 
ultrahigh  performance  liquid  chromatography  (UPLC)‐MS/MS  [38],  and  enzyme‐linked 
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [39]. Since ADMA and SDMA are structural isomers of each other 
with an identical molecular weight of 202.1, chromatographic separation using HPLC with ultra 
violet (UV), radioimmunoassay, and fluorescence (FL) detection was shown to be required. HPLC‐
based methods are the most widely used techniques for assessing ADMA and SDMA levels in 
biological fluids such as plasma, urine, and tissue homogenate. These HPLC methods, however, are 
very time consuming. Although MS‐based methods are more sensitive, ADMA and SDMA exhibit 
different patterns of dissociation between various MS systems. ELISA methods, furthermore, tend to

(purple circle) methylation is performed by a family of enzymes termed protein arginine
methyltransferases (PRMTs), which methylate protein-incorporated L-arginine residues to generate
protein-incorporated N G monomethyl-L-arginine (NMMA; blue circle). Type I PRMTs generate
asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA; black circle) and type II PRMTs convert NMMA to symmetric
dimethylarginine (SDMA; red circle). Protein-incorporated L-arginine residues can also be converted
to citrulline (yellow circle) by peptidylarginine deaminases (PADs), thereby blocking methylation on
the arginine residue. Upon proteolytic cleavage of arginine-methylated proteins, free ADMA and
SDMA are released into the cytoplasm. ADMA and SDMA can be moved out of the cells via cationic
amino acid transporter (CAT) and transported to other organs or excreted in urine. ADMA can
be converted to L-citrulline and dimethylamine by dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase-1
(DDAH-1) and -2 (DDAH-2). Alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase 2 (AGXT2), a mitochondrial
aminotransferase expressed primarily in the kidney, can metabolize ADMA as well as SDMA.
ADMA can be transaminated by the enzyme AGXT2 to α-keto-δ-(NG,NG-dimethylguanidino) valeric
acid (DMGV).
2.3. Quantiﬁcation of ADMA and SDMA
Since ADMA and SDMA show a very narrow range of normal concentrations, high analytical
precision is mandatory to distinguish between normal and slightly elevated concentrations [33]. So far,
analytical techniques for the quantiﬁcation of ADMA and SDMA levels include high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) [ 34], gas chromatography (GC)–mass spectrometry (MS) [ 35],
liquid chromatography with mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS and LC-MS/MS) [36,37],
ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography (UPLC)-MS/MS [ 38], and enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) [39]. Since ADMA and SDMA are structural isomers of each other with
an identical molecular weight of 202.1, chromatographic separation using HPLC with ultra violet (UV),
radioimmunoassay, and ﬂuorescence (FL) detection was shown to be required. HPLC-based methods
are the most widely used techniques for assessing ADMA and SDMA levels in biological ﬂuids such
as plasma, urine, and tissue homogenate. These HPLC methods, however, are very time consuming.
Although MS-based methods are more sensitive, ADMA and SDMA exhibit different patterns of
Toxins 2017, 9, 92 4 of 20
dissociation between various MS systems. ELISA methods, furthermore, tend to overestimate ADMA
concentrations [40,41]; there is only moderate correlation between quantiﬁcation by ELISA compared
with that by UPLC-MS/MS for both ADMA and SDMA [ 38]. Standardized analytical techniques
are required in order for ADMA and SDMA levels to be reliably assessed on a routine basis in
clinical practice.
3. Clinical Conditions Associated with Elevated ADMA and SDMA Levels
3.1. ADMA and SDMA: From Uremic Toxins to CVD Risk Factors
Numerous clinical studies have demonstrated elevated ADMA and SDMA levels in a wide
spectrum of human diseases [ 3–11]. Since ADMA and SDMA are both uremic toxins [ 2],
the pathophysiological relevance of these two toxic non-proteinogenic amino acids has been extensively
investigated in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [42]. Although nearly
all studies show that circulating ADMA levels are elevated in patients with CKD, even before
a reduction in glomerular ﬁltration rate (GFR), ADMA is not considered a prognosis biomarker
in patients with renal disease [42]. A meta-analysis including 2136 patients from 18 studies, however,
demonstrated a strong correlation between SDMA and renal function [43]. Zoccali et al. were the ﬁrst
to report the association between circulating ADMA and cardiovascular disease (CVD) and mortality
in patients with renal disease [44]. Since then, a number of studies have linked circulating ADMA
to CVD risk and mortality in many different study populations. A recent meta-analysis based on
30 studies with 30,624 subjects and 3396 incident CVD events reported that the relative risks for
all-cause mortality associated with CVD were 1.52 (1.37–1.68) and 1.33 (1.22–1.45) for high and low
ADMA concentrations, respectively [45]. Additionally, high vs. low levels of SDMA were shown to be
associated with 31% and 36% increased risk for all-cause mortality and CVD events, respectively [45].
3.2. Clinical Conditions Associated with Elevated ADMA Levels
To date, the list of clinical conditions in which elevated ADMA levels are found continues to grow.
Here, we summarize studies previously reviewed [25,42–46] and highlight new data documenting
associations between elevated ADMA levels and clinical conditions in speciﬁc patient populations.
As shown in Table 1, elevated circulating ADMA concentrations have been described in a variety
of diseases across different age and sex groups [ 3,42,46–90]. Differences in ADMA concentrations
between sexes are small [ 33], whereas difference between different age groups do exist. In adults,
plasma ADMA levels increase with age and the mean plasma concentration of ADMA for a healthy
adult is between 0.4 and 0.6 µM [40]. ADMA levels vary by almost two-fold across the geriatric
population [91] and in neonates, venous cord blood ADMA levels are markedly elevated (~1.06 µM)
and fall signiﬁcantly close to the normal adult value by the second postnatal day (~0.66 µM) [92].
ADMA levels are higher in children than in adults and levels diminish from birth until around 25 years
of age with a mean decrease rate of 15 nM per year [93]. Although ADMA levels are the highest in
geriatric and neonatal populations, whether this U-shaped relationship between normal ADMA levels
and age relates to renal function remains unclear.
In addition to renal disease [ 46], increased plasma ADMA levels are associated with clinical
conditions mainly associated with endothelial dysfunction such as hypertension [48], peripheral arterial
occlusive disease [ 49], hypercholesterolemia [ 50], preeclampsia [ 52], diabetes mellitus [ 53,59],
stroke [55], obesity [ 60], coronary artery disease [ 64], polycystic ovary syndrome [ 67], and sickle
cell disease [71]. Many diseases affect both women and men alike; however, some diseases occurring
at a higher frequency in women (e.g., systemic lupus erythematous) or affecting only women (e.g.,
preeclampsia [52], polycystic ovary syndrome [67], and primary dysmenorrhea [73]) have been linked
with elevated ADMA concentrations. Additionally, some pediatric diseases such as prematurity [64],
congenital urea cycle enzyme defects [69], and transient tachypnea in newborns [88] are associated
with elevated plasma ADMA levels. As shown in Table 1, patients with ASL deﬁciency have been
Toxins 2017, 9, 92 5 of 20
shown to have elevated ADMA levels [69]. It has been noted that hypertension is over-represented in
persons with argininosuccinate lyase (ASL) deﬁciency, a urea cycle disorder [94]. Since ADMA levels
are highly correlated with CVD outcome and the occurrence of preclinical CVD during childhood
is rare, consideration should be given to elucidating the pathophysiological role of ADMA and
to determining the long-term CV outcome in these pediatric diseases. Moreover, it is important
to note that diseases reported with elevated ADMA concentrations exhibit remarkable variability
across different subspecialties. The extent to which the ADMA affects human health warrants
further investigation.

3.3. Clinical Conditions Associated with Elevated SDMA Levels
Despite less attention having been paid to SDMA than to ADMA, there is still a substantial body
of research linking elevated SDMA levels to clinical conditions (Table 2) [44,48,56,57,63,64,95–103].
As already mentioned, a meta-analysis study showed that SDMA levels correlate well with renal
function [44]. SDMA has furthermore been considered a marker of acute kidney injury [104]. As in
the case of ADMA, elevated SDMA levels have been reported in clinical conditions related to
endothelial dysfunction such as hypertension [56], coronary artery disease [64], diabetes mellitus [96],
preeclampsia [99], stroke [100], polycystic ovary syndrome [101], and hyperuricemia [102]. Similar to
ADMA, SDMA has been shown to be able to predict all-cause mortality and CVD events, which is
independent of renal function [44].
3.4. Causal Link between the Plasma Levels of ADMA or SDMA and Clinical Outcome
The list of clinical conditions associated with elevated ADMA and SDMA levels continues to grow;
however, these clinical observations only describe relationships and do not allow for interpretation of
the causality. A few human studies have demonstrated that the administration of ADMA to healthy
volunteers leads to endothelial dysfunction, increased vascular resistance and arterial blood pressure,
as well as decreased cardiac output [105,106]. Although dimethylarginine levels have been analyzed
in different tissue ﬂuid samples in speciﬁc populations [ 107,108], almost all studies demonstrating
an association between ADMA or SDMA and clinical diseases referred to blood plasma levels of
ADMA or SDMA and not tissue levels. Although many studies have demonstrated that plasma
ADMA or SDMA levels are elevated in patients with a broad range of disorders, intracellular ADMA
and SDMA levels in these disorders have not been well studied. Human tissue samples are difﬁcult
to attain and thus in vitro studies may be advantageous for studying intracellular dimethylarginine
regulation. It furthermore remains to be determined whether reduced levels of ADMA and SDMA
result in reduced CVD risk and improved outcome in the above mentioned diseases. It stands to
reason that much of our knowledge on potential therapies involving lowering ADMA and SDMA in
speciﬁc diseases is based on animal research.

4. Pathophysiology of ADMA and SDMA
4.1. ADMA and SDMA: Inhibition of NO Synthesis
The most well-known effect of ADMA and SDMA is the inhibition of NO production.
At physiological extracellular L-arginine and ADMA concentrations, intracellular NOS is well saturated
with the substrate L-arginine and physiological levels of NO are produced. In the presence of
pathological concentrations of ADMA, NOS activity decreases, resulting in a reduction of NO.
Cellular ADMA levels can be 5- to 20-fold higher than those in the plasma and can fall in the range
known to inhibit NOS [ 26]. Under such conditions, the addition of exogenous L-arginine shifts
intracellular ADMA and restores the physiological L-arginine:ADMA ratio to a level that preserves
sufﬁcient NO production. The state of NOS activation or inhibition therefore depends on the local
intracellular L-arginine:ADMA ratio. SDMA, on the other hand, does not directly inhibit NOS but is
a competitive inhibitor of L-arginine transport [12].
4.2. Tissue ADMA and SDMA Concentrations
Although many human diseases, including CVD, are associated with increased plasma levels
of ADMA and SDMA, little is known to date about intracellular levels. Elevated ADMA levels in
the kidneys develop early on, even before the onset of hypertension in four-week-old spontaneously
hypertensive rats (SHRs) [ 109]. Moreover, elevated levels of ADMA in the lung were observed in
the hypertensive stage in SHRs [ 110]. A previous report furthermore demonstrated that ADMA
concentrations are increased in the aortas of obese diabetic mice [ 111] and in a streptozotocin
(STZ)-induced diabetic mother rat model, offspring developed hypertension and kidney disease,
which is associated with elevated renal levels of ADMA [ 112]. These ﬁndings suggest a role for
intracellular ADMA in the development of CVD.
A recent report showed strong differences in ADMA and SDMA levels between different tissues
from mice [ 113]: the concentrations of ADMA and SDMA are high in the kidney, liver, pancreas,
and spleen; intermediate in the lung and heart; and lowest in the brain. The differences in ADMA
abundance across different tissues may be due to differential expression of DDAHs in various tissues.
Data from a DDAH-1 and -2 knockdown model showed that ADMA is regulated by DDAH-1, which is
expressed at sites of ADMA metabolism in the kidney cortex and liver, whereas NO is regulated
primarily by DDAH-2, which is expressed strongly in the blood vessels [114]. Although DDAH-1 is
also highly expressed in the kidney and liver [ 115], both these organs have been reported as major
sites for the metabolism of excessive circulating ADMA [116]. Accordingly, ADMA concentrations
are high in the liver and kidney. Since DDAH-1 is abundantly expressed in the brain at sites of
neuronal NOS expression [98], ADMA may be expeditiously metabolized by DDAH-1 in the brain.
Toxins 2017, 9, 92 8 of 20
Intracellular ADMA can, moreover, be regulated differentially in different tissues in the same disease
model. Plasma, hepatic, and renal ADMA levels have been evaluated simultaneously in young rats
two weeks after bile-duct ligation (BDL), a commonly used cholestatic liver disease model [ 117].
The increase in circulating ADMA results primarily from increased synthesis of ADMA (by increased
PRMT1 abundance) in the liver. The metabolism of ADMA is unaltered in the damaged liver,
indicating unaltered DDAH expression and/or activity in the liver. The decreased renal DDAH
activity, however, suggests that the kidney is unable to metabolize excessive ADMA. Unlike liver
and kidney ADMA levels, ADMA levels in brain cortex of young BDL rats were not altered [ 118].
These ﬁndings highlight the importance of studying tissue ADMA levels instead of plasma ADMA
levels: changes in plasma ADMA do not correlate with intracellular ADMA levels in different tissues.
It is therefore important to note that systemic and tissue ADMA levels must be assessed simultaneously
to elucidate the relative importance of different mechanisms regulating ADMA homeostasis.
4.3. ADMA: Multifunctional Effects
ADMA can uncouple NOS isoenzymes to produce superoxide, contributing to the burden of
oxidative stress [119]. Furthermore, three transcriptomic studies have suggested that ADMA may
contribute to a wide range of pathologies [120–122]. Using microarray technology, Smith et al. ﬁrst
reported that >50 genes were altered in endothelial cells in response to pathological concentrations of
ADMA [120] and BMP signaling and enzymes involved in the arginine methylation pathway were
also shown to be signiﬁcantly regulated by ADMA levels. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was
subsequently used to assess the renal transcriptome response to ADMA in the developing kidney.
A total of 1221 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (735 up- and 486 down-regulated genes in
ADMA-treated vs. control samples) were identiﬁed. Thirteen signiﬁcantly related Kyoto Encyclopedia
of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways were identiﬁed in the developing kidney treated with
ADMA, including ribosome, cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction, chemokine signaling pathway,
neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction, arachidonic acid metabolism, intestinal immune network
for IgA production, systemic lupus erythematosus, toll-like receptor signaling pathway, NOD-like
receptor signaling pathway, tyrosine metabolism, and the MAPK signaling pathway [112,122]. A recent
report furthermore showed that serum starvation profoundly altered the gene expression of LoVo
tumor cells by microarray analysis and that ADMA could restore most of the changes at the
transcriptional level [122]. These ﬁndings imply that pathophysiological concentrations of ADMA can
elicit signiﬁcant changes at the gene expression level and that these changes may be exerted in a NO
pathway-independent manner.
4.4. SDMA: Pro-Inﬂammatory and Pro-Oxidant Properties
Compared with ADMA, little attention has been paid to the pathophysiological role of SDMA.
In addition to inhibiting NO production [ 12], SDMA may have pro-inﬂammatory effects [ 123].
SDMA has been reported to induce the expression of CD11a, CD11b, and CD14 in monocytes as
well as CD18 expression in granulocytes to enhance the differentiation and adhesion capacity of
leukocytes to the endothelium. Additionally, SDMA may induce reactive oxygen species (ROS)
via store-operated calcium inﬂux in monocytes [ 15] and enhancement of NADPH-oxidase via the
activation of endothelial Toll-like receptor-2 [124]. Accordingly, SDMA may be involved directly or
indirectly in the pathogenesis of CVD because of its pro-inﬂammatory and pro-oxidant properties.
5. Potential Therapies for Reducing ADMA and SDMA Levels
To date, there is a lack of potential therapeutic strategies against elevated ADMA and SDMA
levels in various diseases. Since both dimethylarginines are water-soluble uremic toxins [2], it would
be logical to consider dialysis as a potential means of decreasing of circulating ADMA and SDMA
levels. A previous study showed that a single dialysis session reduced ADMA and SDMA plasma
levels by 23% and 40%, respectively [125], and the removal of ADMA and SDMA by dialysis seems to
Toxins 2017, 9, 92 9 of 20
be hampered by complex kinetics of these two uremic toxins. Dialysis is furthermore not suitable for
non-uremia patients in clinical practice.
Since approximately 80% of ADMA is metabolized in the body, alternative therapeutic
approaches have been assessed; however, to date, a speciﬁc ADMA-lowering agent is still not
available. As previously reviewed by us and others [ 6,122,126], a few drugs have been reported
to lower ADMA levels in clinical studies. These include angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors,
angiotensin receptor blockers, fenoﬁbrate, oral contraceptives, folic acid, metformin, and α-lipoic
acid. Despite a partial reduction of plasma ADMA levels by these therapies, the underlying
mechanisms of their ADMA-lowering effects are still unclear. Since PRMTs control ADMA production
and as DDAHs and AGXT2 regulate its metabolism, the discovery and application of speciﬁc
PRMT inhibitors, DDAH activators, or AGXT2 activators may represent potential therapeutic
strategies. The development of speciﬁc PRMT inhibitors, DDAH activators, and AGXT2 activators
for ADMA suppression, however, remains a challenging area of research [ 7,127,128]. Currently,
numerous therapies have been shown to reduce ADMA concentrations in a wide range of animal
models (Table 3) [ 110,112,129–168]. Some of the major approaches include the restoration of the
imbalance between L-arginine and ADMA, the regulation of DDAH enzymes and/or activity, and the
inhibition of PRMT expression.

Since L-arginine is the substrate for NOS-mediated production of NO, L-arginine and L-citrulline
(the precursor of L-arginine) supplementation have been reported to reduce ADMA and increase NO
bioavailability in a variety of models with elevated ADMA levels [ 112,134,149,150]. A number of
animal studies have furthermore indicated that pioglitazone [131], farnesoid X receptor agonist [132],
telmisartan [136], resveratrol [137], melatonin [117,138], atorvastatin [143], shichimotsukokato [144],
vitamin E [145], salvianolic acid A [146], N-acetylcysteine [148], oxymatrine [152], metformin [154],
epigallocatechin-3-gallate [166], and rosuvastatin [168] can increase the activity and/or expression
of DDAHs and thereby reduce ADMA levels. On the other hand, telmisartan [ 136], glucagon-like
peptide-1 receptor agonist [147], epigallocatechin-3-gallate [166], and rosuvastatin [168] may reduce
ADMA levels via decreased PRMT-1 expression. However, whether these ADMA-lowering therapies
not only reduce circulating ADMA levels but also ADMA levels in target organs requires further
clariﬁcation. Further investigation is also required to determine the mechanisms of other effective
ADMA-lowering agents and to clarify whether these agents can be applied to different disease models
associated with elevated ADMA levels.

6. Conclusions
Since the ﬁrst isolation of ADMA and SDMA from human urine in 1970, there has been substantial
evidence revealing the signiﬁcance of these two non-proteinogenic amino acids in human health and
diseases. ADMA and SDMA are known uremic toxins and the most well-known effect of these two
toxic amino acids is the suppression of NO production. High plasma ADMA or SDMA concentrations
not only predict all-cause mortality and CVD events, but are also relevant to a broad range of diseases.
Although signiﬁcant progress has been made in research on ADMA and SDMA, there is a need for
a simple and sensitive method for measuring ADMA and SDMA levels simultaneously on a routine
basis. The development of speciﬁc pharmacological therapy for lowering ADMA and SDMA levels in
target organs is still a far-off goal and requires a deeper understanding of the multifunctional effects of
ADMA and SDMA in target organs that induce a variety of diseases. Accordingly, there is an urgent
need for the elucidation of unknown biological functions and for the development of effective strategies
for treating diseases associated with high levels of ADMA and SDMA.
