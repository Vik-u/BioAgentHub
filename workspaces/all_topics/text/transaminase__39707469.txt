Abstract
In preclinical studies, GST-HG141, a novel hepatitis B virus (HBV) capsid assembly modulator displayed potent anti-
HBV activity in vitro and strong efficacy in HBV animal models. A randomized, double-blind, ascending phase 1b 
trial assessed the pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of GST-HG141 in chronic hepatitis B (CHB) individuals. Thirty 
treatment-naïve CHB patients were enrolled in three cohorts (25, 50, and 100 mg twice orally after meals daily) over 
28 days, with 10 subjects per cohort (8:2 ratio for GST-HG141 and placebo). Dose-related safety and tolerability, 
pharmacokinetic profiles, and drug responses were evaluated. GST-HG141 exhibited a generally favorable safety 
profile across all doses with predominantly mild adverse reactions, including three cases of grade 1 transaminase 
elevations. Significant reductions in HBV DNA and pregenomic RNA (pgRNA) levels were observed across all doses 
of (25, 50, and 100 mg of GST-HG141, twice-daily) after 28 days of treatment. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed a 
consistent linear trend in GST-HG141 concentrations, with mean trough concentrations ranging from 75 to 240 ng/
mL. These concentrations adequately covered the protein binding-adjusted EC50 (16.89 ng/mL) by factors of 4.4, 
11.1, and 14.6 for doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg, respectively. Our study demonstrated GST-HG141’s well-tolerated 
profile up to 100 mg over 4 weeks, alongside robust antiviral activity in CHB patients, supporting its progression 
into further clinical investigation for CHB management.

Introduction
Chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection represents a 
significant global health threat, leading to substantial 
liver-related morbidity and mortality [ 1, 2]. The primary 
risk factor for disease progression in chronically infected 
individuals is an elevated serum HBV DNA concentra -
tion. Reducing the HBV DNA load is the best strategy for 
hepatitis B treatment [ 3, 4]. Although therapies such as 
nucleoside analogs and pegylated interferon-alpha can 
control HBV infection, they often fail to completely erad-
icate the virus, and they can cause adverse reactions such 
as drug resistance and viral recurrence [5, 6].
To address these challenges, there is a pressing need 
for novel antivirals with alternative mechanisms to effec -
tively inhibit viral replication. One promising mechanism 
for novel therapeutics is modulating HBV capsid assem -
bly, a crucial step of viral life cycle facilitated by core viral 
proteins. These proteins play diverse roles in the HBV 
life cycle [ 7, 8], making them attractive targets for inter -
vention. The emerging classes of anti-HBV therapeu -
tics include core protein allosteric regulators (CpAMs) 
[9, 10]. These can be categorized into capsid assembly 
modulator-anomaly (CAM-A) and capsid assembly 
modulator-empty (CAM-E). CAM-As induce the forma -
tion of abnormal non-capsid polymers, whereas CAM-Es 
accelerate the formation of HBV capsids and induce the 
formation of “empty” capsids devoid of genetic material. 
Both drug classes inhibit pgRNA encapsidation and viral 
replication [11–15].
GST-HG141 is a novel capsid assembly modulator 
grouped into the CAM-E category, but it has some novel 
features distinct from those of other CAM-Es [ 10]. GST-
HG141 targets HBV core capsid assembly by regulating 
core protein conformation, effectively inhibiting HBV 
replication. Preclinical studies demonstrated its potent 
antiviral activities in vitro and strong efficacy in HBV ani-
mal models in vivo. GST-HG141 also displayed an excel -
lent safety profile and activity in preclinical safety and 
pharmacokinetic studies.
Based on the safety and tolerability data from a phase 
1a study using single ascending doses (up to 500 mg) and 
multiple ascending doses (up to 200 mg) of GST-HG141 
(BID for 7 days), GST-HG141 was found to be well tol -
erated in healthy subjects [ 16]. Our phase 1b trial evalu -
ated the efficacy, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of 
multiple ascending doses of GST-HG141 in patients with 
chronic HBV infection. This study marks a crucial step in 
advancing this potential novel therapy for the manage -
ment of CHB.
Materials and methods
Study design and administration
The study was structured as a randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, phase 1b clinical trial  (   h t t p s : / / c l i n i 
c a l t r i a l s . g o v     , trial Identifier: NCT04868981), and it was 
conducted at the Phase I Clinical Trial Unit of the First 
Hospital of Jilin University (Jilin, China). The clinical 
study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee 
of the Jilin University First Affiliated Hospital-Clinical 
Research Institute (Approval Number 21Y088-001). Prior 
to participation, all patients provided written informed 
consent. A cohort of 30 patients with chronic hepatitis 
(CHB) was recruited to receive either GST-HG141 at 
doses of 25, 50, or 100 mg BID or placebo over a 28-day 
period (Fig.  1). Each dose cohort underwent continu -
ous administration for 28 days. From day 1 to day 27, the 
medication was administered orally twice a day with an 
interval of approximately 12  h. On day 28, it was given 
once in the morning. All subjects had regular breakfast 
and/or dinner 30 min prior to taking the medicine. After 
taking the medication, the subjects were provided with 
approximately 240 mL of warm water in the post-meal 
state. Within each cohort, 10 subjects were randomly 
assigned at a ratio of 8:2 to receive either GST-HG141 
or placebo. GST-HG141 was administered in the clini -
cal research center on days 1–3 and 26–33, with patients 
continuing treatment at home under the same condi -
tions between hospital visits (Figure S1). Patients were 
scheduled for follow-up visits on days 8, 15, 22, and 33 
and at the time of early termination when necessary. The 
randomization process was executed using an electronic 
data capture system, with further details provided in 
Additional file 1.
Patient selection
Regarding patient selection, subjects aged 18–70 with 
CHB were eligible for participation. Additional inclu -
sion criteria were as follows: (1) chronic HBV infection 
(defined as hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg] positiv -
ity for ≥ 6 months or negativity for hepatitis B core anti -
body immunoglobulin M); (2) serum HBV DNA levels of 
≥ 2 × 105 IU/mL for hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)-posi -
tive individuals or ≥ 2 × 104 IU/mL for HBeAg-negative 
individuals; (3) serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) 
levels within 5× the upper limit of normal (ULN); and (4) 
no prior treatment or discontinuation of interferon treat-
ment at least 12 months prior to enrollment or nucleos(t)
ide analog treatment least 6 months prior to enrollment.
The exclusion criteria were as follows: (a) serum total 
bilirubin > 2× ULN; (b) co-infection with syphilis, human 
immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis C virus; (c) con -
current severe chronic medical conditions or malignan -
cies; (d) serum alpha-fetoprotein levels exceeding 50 µg/L 
or malignancy detected via imaging; and (e) presence of 
liver cirrhosis (as indicated by FibroScan score ≥ 12.4 kPa 
when ALT was normal or < 2× ULN or FibroScan 
score > 17.5 when ALT was ≥ 2× ULN). Additionally, each 
group required a minimum of four subjects with elevated

ALT (> 1× ULN). Further inclusion and exclusion criteria 
are delineated in Additional file 1.
Evaluation of tolerability
To assess the tolerability of the drug, routine clinical 
examinations were conducted alongside sign monitor -
ing and various laboratory tests including hematology, 
biochemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis. Addition -
ally, electrocardiogram, as well as abdominal and adre -
nal ultrasound, was performed. The determination of 
treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) adhered to 
the guidelines outlined in the National Cancer Institute 
Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (NCI-
CTCAE, 5.0).
Pharmacokinetic assessment
Blood samples were collected intermittently to analyze 
GST-HG141PK using an anticoagulant (K2-EDTA). After 
centrifuging the samples at 2000 × g for 10 min, the resul-
tant supernatant from each sample was carefully sepa -
rated and preserved at − 80 °C until further analysis.
Assessment of effectiveness
The effectiveness of the treatment was evaluated by mon-
itoring changes in the serum levels of HBsAg, hepatitis 
B core-related antigen (HBcrAg), HBeAg, HBV pgRNA, 
and HBV DNA at various intervals. Blood samples 
were collected on day 1 before administering the treat -
ment (baseline) and on days 1, 15, 29, and 33 after treat -
ment initiation. Additionally, samples for detecting viral 
resistance to GST-HG141 were obtained on days 1 (prior 
to treatment) and 29 (24 h after the final dose on day 28). 
HBV DNA levels were assessed using COBAS kits (Roche 
Diagnostics, Pleasanton, CA, USA). The lowest detect -
able level with this kit is 10 IU/mL. HBeAg and HBsAg 
serum levels were quantitatively evaluated using COBAS 
kits (Roche e601, CA, USA), while HBcrAg was detected 
using a Lumipulse G1200 assay (Fujirebio Europe, Bel -
gium). All measurements were conducted at Teddy Clini-
cal Research Laboratory in Shanghai, China.
Statistical analysis
Plasma concentrations of GST141 were utilized to assess 
pharmacokinetic parameters using non-compartmental 
methodology, including the terminal elimination half-life 
(t1/2), volume of distribution, clearance, λz, area under 
the plasma concentration–time curve (AUC0 − t, AUC0−∞), 
time to reach the maximum plasma concentration, and 
maximum plasma concentration (C max). These param -
eters were calculated using WinNonlin® Enterprise (ver -
sion 8.3) software. Additional statistical analyses were 
conducted using SAS 9.4 software (SAS, Cary, NC, USA). 
The dose proportionality of GST-HG141 was assessed 
utilizing the power model and linear fixed-effects model. 
Descriptive analysis was employed to evaluate antiviral 
activity indices, tolerability, and safety.

Results
Participant characteristics
Of 44 individuals screened, 30 were selected for random -
ization, and notably, there were no withdrawals from 
the study. The flow chart is presented in Fig.  1. Gener -
ally, demographic and disease characteristics were well 
balanced across the groups (Table  1). All 30 recruited 
individuals were included in the full analysis set, safety 
analysis set, pharmacodynamic analysis set, and pharma -
cokinetic parameter analysis dataset. Among the enrolled 
subjects, 90% (27 of 30) were HBeAg-negative, and the 
cohort included an equal number of males and females. 
Baseline HBV DNA levels ranged from 7.54 to 8.25 
log10 IU/mL. Before treatment initiation, serum levels of 
HBsAg and HBV DNA were similar across the different 
treatment groups, whereas HBeAg levels were slightly 
lower in the 50-mg cohort than in the 25- and 100-mg 
cohorts. All enrolled patients were HBeAg-positive and 
treatment-naïve. Additionally, albumin and platelet lev -
els, as presented in Table  1, were comparable across all 
groups, and they remained within normal ranges.
Assessment of tolerability
Throughout the 28-day treatment period, there were no 
instances of mortality, serious adverse events, or discon -
tinuations attributed to adverse drug reactions (ADRs). 
The incidence of ADRs by treatment group is detailed 
in Table  2. Overall, GST-HG141 demonstrated a favor -
able safety profile, and it was well tolerated among the 
subjects. Among the randomized individuals, 21 clinical 
ADRs (adverse events deemed definitely, very likely, or 
possibly related to the study drug) were reported, affect -
ing 50% (12 of 24) of the dosed subjects. The incidence 
rates of adverse reactions in each dosage cohort were 
as follows: 25  mg, 62.5% (5 of 8); 50  mg, 37.5% (3 of 
8); 100  mg, 50.0% (4 of 8); and placebo, 33.3% (2 of 6). 
Although the incidence of ADRs was slightly higher in 
the treatment groups than in the placebo group, however 
no significant difference was found (P = 0.65). Notably, 
all TEAEs were mild, and their frequency or severity did 
not increase with increasing GST-HG141 doses (Table 2). 
No grade ≥ 3 ADRs were reported, and all ADRs either 
reverted to baseline levels or remained stable. The most 
commonly reported ADRs (in ≥ 2 subjects) included 
decreased neutrophil counts (12.5%, 3 of 24), decreased 
leukocyte counts (8.3%, 2 of 24), hypophosphatemia 
(8.3%, 2 of 24), increased alanine aminotransferase levels 
(8.3%, 2 of 24), and increased aspartate aminotransferase 
levels (8.3%, 2 of 24). Notably, no instances of decrease 
albumin levels or total bilirubin elevation were observed. 
The transaminase elevations noted in three patients (ran -
domization Nos. 1001, 1002, and 3002) were mild (grade 
1). In conclusion, GST-HG141 tablets at dosages of 25, 
50, and 100 mg BD were well tolerated by patients with 
CHB following continuous administration for 28 days.
Antiviral effectiveness
Over the treatment period, HBV DNA levels exhibited 
a consistent decrease, reaching their lowest point on 
day 29. Notably, the reduction in HBV DNA levels after

28 days of treatment varied across the dosage groups 
of GST-HG141, namely − 3.01 (0.47), − 2.92 (1.26), 
and − 3.43 (055) log 10 IU/mL in the 25-, 50-, and 100-
mg groups, respectively ( P < 0.05, Fig.  2). Although the 
decrease in HBV DNA levels was not significantly differ -
ent between the 25- and 50-mg cohorts, a slightly greater 
reduction were observed in the 100-mg cohort. Rebound 
effects were observed after day 33, although the HBV 
DNA levels remained below the baseline and the speed of 
the rebound decreased with increasing treatment dosage. 
No significant changes were noted in the placebo group.
Following the 28-day treatment period, a dose-depen -
dent decrease in HBV pgRNA levels was observed 
across the GST-HG141 cohorts, with the most signifi -
cant reduction compared to baseline observed on day 
29. Specifically, the reductions were − 2.37 (0.78) log 10 
IU/mL for 100-mg cohort, − 1.93 (0.90) log 10 IU/mL for 
50-mg cohort, and − 1.71 (1.00) log 10 IU/mL for 25-mg 
cohort. Although rebound effects were noted after day 
33, pgRNA levels remained lower than baseline.
Decreases in HBcrAg levels from baseline were evi -
dent in the GST-HG141 cohorts, with rebound effects 
observed up to day 33, although its levels remained below 
baseline. Similar to HBV DNA and pgRNA, no significant 
changes were observed in the placebo group. Follow -
ing 28 days of treatment, the mean declines in HBcrAg 
levels were recorded as − 0.25 log10 U/mL in the 25-mg 
cohort, − 0.30 log10 U/mL in the 50-mg cohort, and − 0.25 
log10 U/mL in the 100-mg cohort on day 29. Notably, the 
extent of the decline did not vary significantly across the 
dosage groups. Additionally, the mean declines in HBeAg 
levels were − 0.08, − 0.05, and − 0.09 log10 U/mL in the 
25-, 50-, and 100-mg groups, respectively, on day 29. No 
notable changes were observed in HBsAg levels after the 
28-day treatment period, and neither HBeAg nor HBsAg 
underwent seroconversion. Serum ALT and AST levels 
exhibited minor decreases, and the mean changes were 
not significantly different across the treatment groups.
Pharmacokinetic analysis
The concentration–time profiles of GST-HG141 in the 
GST-HG141 cohorts are depicted in Fig.  3, with the cor -
responding pharmacokinetic parameters outlined in 
Table 3. Following BID administration of GST-HG141 at 
doses of 25–100 mg for 28 consecutive days, the plasma 
concentrations of GST-HG141 were increased post-drug 
administration, peaking at approximately 3–3.5 h on day 
1 and 2–3.5 h on day 28. Notably, t1/2 of GST-HG141 was 
prolonged with multiple doses. The plasma concentra -
tions of GST-HG141 appeared to stabilize after day 8. 
On day 28, the average plasma trough concentrations for 
patients administered 25, 50, or 100  mg of GST-HG141 
were 4.4-, 11.1-, and 14.6-fold higher, respectively, than 
its protein binding-adjusted HBV DNA EC50 (17 ng/
mL).
The geometric mean ratios and lower limits of the 
90% confidence interval of AUC 0 − 12  h and C max on day 
28 compared with day 1 were all greater than 1 across 
all dose cohorts, indicating mild accumulation of GST-
HG141 in subjects after 28 days of BID dosing. The 
accumulation rates were consistent among the cohorts. 
Moreover, GST-HG141 exposure (Cmax and AUC) exhib-
ited a dose- and time-dependent increase, displaying a 
linear pharmacokinetic trend. Notably, the slopes of AUC 
and C max power ranged from 0.46 to 0.61, all of which 
were less than 1, suggesting no significant proportional 
relationship between pharmacokinetic parameters and 
the GST-HG141 dose within the 25–100-mg range.

and efficacy of GST-HG141, a novel capsid assembly 
modulator, in patients with chronic HBV infection over 
a 28-day treatment period. Our findings revealed that 
GST-HG141 exhibited safety and tolerability, with sig -
nificant reductions observed in the serum levels of HBV 
DNA and HBV pgRNA following 28 days of treatment.
Safety considerations are paramount in the manage -
ment of chronic diseases such as hepatitis B. In our study, 
we observed an overall adverse reactions incidence rate 
of 50% among randomized dosed subjects, with no sig -
nificant correlation with drug dosage noted. Importantly, 
all adverse reactions recorded in this study were of grade 
1–2 in severity. In patients receiving GST-HG141, the 
incidence of elevated ALT and AST levels was equal at 
8.3%. This incidence of elevated aminotransferases was 
lower than that reported for similar capsid assembly 
modulators in the literature such as ZM-H1505R (cano -
capavir) and ABI-H0731 [ 14, 17]. Because of the rela -
tively short treatment duration of 4 weeks in our study, 
longer-term treatment and observation are warranted. 
Nevertheless, our findings suggest that GST-HG141 is 
safe and well tolerated in patients with CHB.
In previous studies [ 13, 17], patients with elevated 
baseline ALT levels were found to be more prone to expe-
riencing ALT flares in the course of antiviral treatment. 
This phenomenon typically coincided with the reduc -
tion of both viral antigen and HBV DNA levels, suggest -
ing that ALT flares represent a therapeutic response. We 
observed a notable example of this phenomenon in one 
patient (randomization No. 2010) receiving 100  mg of 
GST-HG141. This patient had a baseline ALT level of 136 
U/L, which gradually increased to 196 U/L on day 29 and 
peaked at 356 U/L on day 33, coinciding with reductions 
in HBV marker levels ( − 2.8 log10 IU/mL for HBV DNA, 
− 1.8 log10 U/mL for HBV pgRNA, − 0.3 log10 U/mL for 
HBcrAg, and − 0.1 log10 IU/mL for HBsAg).
Similarly, in another patient (randomization No. 1002, 
25  mg), the ALT level increased from 62 U/L at base -
line to a peak of 171 U/L on day 33, whereas in a patient 
(randomization No. 3002) taking 100 mg of GST-HG141, 
the ALT level increased from 101.2 U/L at baseline to 
a peak of 189.5 U/L on day 33. These increases in ALT 
levels were accompanied by significant declines in HBV 
DNA marker levels (− 3.8 log10 IU/mL [patient 3002] and 
− 2.6 log10 IU/mL [patient 1002]). These patients did not 
display any irregularities in serum albumin and biliru -
bin levels or in the international normalized ratio. The 
increase in ALT levels in some patients during treatment 
might signify the elimination of HBV-infected liver cells 
by the activated immune system [18, 19].
Despite some biochemical distinct features, GST-
HG141 belongs to the CAM-E class of drugs, which have 
displayed promise in the treatment of CHB. However, 
other CpAMs have been associated with adverse effects 
such as aminotransferase elevation or ALT flares. For 
instance, the CAM-A GLS4 was reported to induce ALT 
flares in some patients after 28 days of treatment, lead -
ing to study withdrawal and necessitating silybin and 
glutathione therapy [ 13]. Similarly, the CAM-E ABI-
H0731 caused grade 3 treatment-associated liver enzyme 
elevation in some patients after 28 days of continuous 
treatment [ 14]. Notably, although a phase 1a study of 
GST-HG141 reported a case of grade 4 creatine kinase 
elevation in a healthy individual [ 16], no such adverse

reaction was observed in this 28-day continuous adminis-
tration study. Thus, despite the relatively short treatment 
duration in our study (4 weeks), GST-HG141 did not 
appear to increase the risk of adverse effects in patients.
It is noteworthy that our results demonstrated robust 
declines in the serum levels of HBV DNA and HBV 
pgRNA in patients across the 25–100 mg BID treatment 
cohorts. Specifically, the mean decreases from base -
line in HBV DNA levels after 28 days of treatment were 
− 3.01, − 2.92, and − 3.43 log10 IU/mL at doses of 25, 50, 
and 100  mg BID, respectively. Although no clear dose–
efficacy correlation was observed, substantial reductions 
in HBV DNA were evident, suggesting that even the 
25 mg dose achieved favorable therapeutic effects. When 
the baseline level of HBV DNA among different treat -
ment groups was adjusted, a more dose-related effect 
on HBV DNA reduction was observed − 2.98, − 3.10, and 
− 3.44 log10 IU/mL at doses of 25, 50, and 100  mg BID, 
respectively).
Compared to the antiviral efficacy of ABI-H0731, 
another CAM-E with structural similarity to GST-
HG141, GST-HG141 appeared favorable regarding 
HBV DNA level reductions. ABI-H0731 achieved mean 
HBV DNA reductions of approximately 2.1 log 10 IU/mL 
at 100 mg and only 2.8 log 10 IU/mL at a dose as high as 
300 mg in a similarly designed study [ 14]. Moreover, the 
tolerability of GST-HG141 appeared also superior to that 
of ABI-H0731.
The most significant reductions in HBV DNA levels 
were noted from baseline to day 15, with a slower rate 
of decline thereafter. This trend aligns with the typi -
cal biphasic decline observed with nucleos(t)ide analog 
inhibitors [20]. Earlier measurements, particularly before 
day 15, could offer more precise insights into the anti -
viral kinetics of GST-HG141. Furthermore, our study 
confirmed the effectiveness of GST-HG141 in inhibiting 
the assembly of HBV nucleocapsid, reducing the levels 
of cccDNA, inhibiting the production of HBV pgRNA-
containing particles, and preventing viral replication 
observed in preclinical studies [ 21, 22, 23]. As an HBV 
core inhibitor, GST-HG141 operates by disturbing core 
protein function and aggregation, but it does not directly 
influence HBV gene expression. Consequently, dur -
ing the relatively brief 4-week dosing period, no notable 
clinical alterations in HBeAg or HBsAg concentrations 
(≥ 0.5 log10 IU/mL) were detected. Nevertheless, certain 
patients displayed noteworthy decreases in HBcrAg lev -
els, suggesting an interruption in the expression of spe -
cific proteins translated from pgRNA.
This study presents initial clinical evidence demon -
strating significant inhibition of viral production in 
patients with CHB through GST-HG141 monotherapy. 
Future extensive clinical investigations will delve deeper 
into the mechanism and antiviral efficacy of GST-HG141 
and explore potential combinations with other antivi -
ral agents. Moreover, the administration of GST-HG141 
post-prandially might enhance its bioavailability, as indi -
cated by pharmacokinetic profiles in phase 1a study illus -
trating rapid absorption and minimal drug accumulation 
[16].
Nevertheless, this study had several limitations, includ -
ing a short treatment and follow-up duration, a small 
sample size, and a lack of analysis regarding immunoin -
flammatory factors. These constraints will be addressed 
in forthcoming multicenter phase 2 studies encompass -
ing larger patient cohorts with extended treatment and 
follow-up periods.
Conclusions
Among individuals with CHB, GST-HG141 exhibited a 
reassuring safety profile even at doses as high as 100 mg, 
with no discernible pattern of serious safety concerns. 
The majority of adverse reactions were mild to moder -
ate (grade 1 or 2), and there was no apparent dose-related 
trends in either the frequency or severity of adverse 
events. Importantly, no instances of serious adverse reac -
tions linked to elevated aminotransferase levels were 
reported. Pharmacokinetic analysis revealed a consistent 
linear trend and low-to-mild accumulation rates (1.31–
1.69) across the 25-100  mg doses of GST-HG141. After 
a 28-day treatment course, GST-HG141 substantially 
reduced the serum levels of both HBV DNA and HBV 
pgRNA among patients with CHB. These results under -
score the merit of advancing GST-HG141 into additional 
clinical studies as a promising therapeutic option for 
managing CHB.
