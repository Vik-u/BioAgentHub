Abstract 
Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a challenge in clinical medicine and drug development. Highly sensitive novel biomarkers have 
been identified for detecting DILI following a paracetamol overdose. The study objective was to evaluate biomarker performance in a 
14-day trial of therapeutic dose paracetamol. The PATH-BP trial was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. Individuals 
(n ¼ 110) were randomized to receive 1 g paracetamol 4× daily or matched placebo for 2 weeks followed by a 2-week washout before 
crossing over to the alternate treatment. Blood was collected on days 0 (baseline), 4, 7, and 14 in both arms. Alanine transaminase 
(ALT) activity was measured in all patients. MicroRNA-122 (miR-122), cytokeratin-18 (K18), and glutamate dehydrogenase (GLDH) 
were measured in patients who had an elevated ALT on paracetamol treatment (≥50% from baseline). ALT increased in 49 
individuals (45%). All 3 biomarkers were increased at the time of peak ALT (K18 paracetamol arm: 18.9 ± 9.7 ng/ml, placebo arm: 11.1 ± 
5.4 ng/ml, ROC-AUC ¼ 0.80, 95% CI 0.71–0.89; miR-122: 15.1 ± 12.9fM V 4.9 ± 4.7fM, ROC-AUC ¼ 0.83, 0.75–0.91; and GLDH: 24.6 ± 31.1U/l 
V 12.0 ± 11.8U/l, ROC-AUC ¼ 0.66, 0.49–0.83). All biomarkers were correlated with ALT (K18 r ¼ 0.68, miR-122 r ¼ 0.67, GLDH r ¼ 0.60). To 
assess sensitivity, biomarker performance was analyzed on the visit preceding peak ALT (mean 3 days earlier). K18 identified the 
subsequent ALT increase (K18 ROC-AUC ¼ 0.70, 0.59–0.80; miR-122 ROC-AUC ¼ 0.60, 0.49–0.72, ALT ROC-AUC ¼ 0.59, 0.48–0.70; GLDH 
ROC-AUC ¼ 0.70, 0.50–0.90). Variability was lowest for ALT and K18. In conclusion, K18 was more sensitive than ALT, miR-122, or 
GLDH and has potential significant utility in the early identification of DILI in trials and clinical practice.

Drug-induced liver injury (DILI) is a major challenge for public 
health and drug development. DILI is a leading cause of acute 
liver failure (ALF) (case fatality of around 30%–35%), with about 
30% of patients with ALF needing to receive a liver transplant 
with its associated risks and financial costs ( Stravitz and Lee, 
2019 ). In drug development, DILI is one of the leading causes of 
drug attrition and withdrawal of drugs during the development 
phase ( Kullak-Ublick et al., 2017 ). This can result in huge financial 
losses for the drug developer and reduces the availability of new 
medicines for patients with unmet clinical needs.
Medicines with a liability for producing DILI can be used safely 
and effectively. For example, immune checkpoint inhibitors 
(ICIs) have transformed the treatment of a range of cancers 
despite being well-established to produce DILI, especially when 2 
ICIs are combined ( Regev et al., 2020 ). To safely use such medi -
cines there may be a need for risk mitigation strategies to 
improve the risk/benefit balance. For example, if DILI could be 
identified earlier then targeted safety monitoring could be inten -
sified, the causal medicine could be withheld, or its dose modi -
fied before harm occurs to the patient. Early detection of DILI is 
especially important when one or more medicines must be re- 
introduced after an episode of DILI, such as occurs when the 
treatment of tuberculosis (TB) requires re-introduction of effec -
tive but potentially hepatotoxic antimicrobials ( Moosa et al., 
2022 ). Monitoring for DILI typically involves blood being taken in 
a healthcare facility with analysis in central hospital laborato -
ries. Future strategies may decentralize monitoring with point of 
care analysis near to the patient, such as home monitoring for 
DILI in early phase clinical trials of selected medicines with a 
DILI liability or community monitoring for TB medicine DILI in 
low- and middle-income countries (LMICs).
To improve the diagnosis of DILI, there has been a global effort 
to identify and develop new biomarkers with enhanced sensitiv -
ity and/or specificity or that provide new mechanistic insights.

Research article   
Paracetamol (acetaminophen) is the most common cause of DILI, 
and is the classic example of intrinsic DILI, as the risk of injury is 
directly related to the dose due to hepatocellular injury being 
mediated by a toxic metabolite ( Ramachandran and Jaeschke, 
2017 ). Patients attending hospital following an acute paraceta -
mol overdose have provided a well-characterized population to 
establish proof-of-concept that novel biomarkers such as 
cytokeratin-18 (K18) and microRNA-122 (miR-122) may be more 
sensitive than the standard biomarker alanine transaminase 
(ALT) ( Dear et al., 2018 ). Transatlantic collaborations such as 
Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN), Predictive Safety 
Testing Consortium (PSTC), Safer and Faster Evidence-based 
Translation (SAFE-T), and Translational Safety Biomarker 
Pipeline (TransBioLine) have demonstrated the potential utility of 
multiple protein and RNA circulating biomarkers (including K18 
and miR-122) in patients with idiosyncratic DILI (DILI resulting 
from characteristics of the individual affected and not clearly 
related to drug dose or duration [ Fontana, 2014 ]) secondary to 
therapeutic use of a range of medicines ( Church et al., 2019 ). 
Idiosyncratic DILI is a rare event and these studies are, therefore, 
case-control by necessity, with the cases having well-established 
liver injury. It remains unclear whether new biomarkers can 
identify idiosyncratic DILI before standard biomarkers are 
increased. In this study, we used paracetamol as a model of 
chronic dosing to provide proof of concept as to whether new bio -
markers could potentially identify DILI before standard markers 
are increased.
Reported in a 2021 paper, we identified a 3-biomarker panel 
(K18, miR-122, and glutamate dehydrogenase [GLDH]) which accu -
rately detected DILI after acute paracetamol overdose ( Llewellyn 
et al., 2021 ). Previous studies have also investigated the sensitivity 
of these biomarkers in tuberculosis treatment-related DILI in 
European and Ugandan populations ( Rupprechter et al., 2021 ). 
Here, we report the results of testing this biomarker panel in a pre -
defined analysis of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover 
trial of paracetamol at therapeutic doses, which acts as a model 
for early phase drug trials ( MacIntyre et al., 2022 ). This allowed 
testing of whether one or more of the new biomarkers can detect 
DILI earlier than ALT in a multiple dosing trial and, therefore, may 
be valuable in future trials and clinical practice.
Materials and methods
Study design
This study was a substudy of the PATH-BP trial ( MacIntyre et al., 
2022 ). It was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo- 
controlled, investigator-initiated crossover study. The aim of the 
study was to assess the impact of regular paracetamol treatment 
on blood pressure (BP) in individuals with hypertension during a 
2-week period. The study was performed in the University of 
Edinburgh’s Clinical Research Centre (Western General Hospital, 
Edinburgh, UK). The study protocol was approved by the East of 
Scotland Research Ethics Service (13/ES/0087) and the Medicines 
and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (2013-003204-40). It 
was registered with the U.S. National Institutes of Health 
(https://clinicaltrials.gov; Unique identifier: NCT01997112) and 
European Union Drug Regulating Authorities Clinical Trials 
Database (https://www.clinical-trialsregister.eu; Unique identi -
fier: 2013-003204-40).
Study population
To be eligible for the study, individuals had to be aged ≥18 years of 
age and hypertensive. Individuals had to be either treated for 
hypertension, with an average daytime ambulatory BP of <150/ 
95 mm Hg on stable doses of ≥1 antihypertensive medication, or 
untreated with an average daytime ambulatory BP ≥135/85 mm Hg 
and <150/95 mm Hg. Individuals with a history of ischemic heart 
disease, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, liver impairment 
(ALT >50 IU/l), chronic kidney disease staged III–V, or suicidal idea -
tion were excluded from the study. Individuals were also excluded 
if they weighed <55 kg or were regularly taking acetaminophen/ 
paracetamol, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corti -
costeroids, or oral anticoagulants. Written informed consent was 
provided by all participants prior to study involvement.
Screening was conducted for 204 local participants, and 110 
participants were randomized onto the PATH-BP study 
( MacIntyre et al., 2022 ). The dropout rate was less than 10%, with 
7 participants not completing both arms of the study. 
Consequently, 103 participants were included in the modified 
intention-to-treat analysis, ensuring a balanced representation 
across all baseline characteristics in the study group.
The inclusion criterion for this biomarker substudy was a 
greater than 50% increase in ALT activity from baseline on para -
cetamol treatment. This was the definition of an ALT increase 
used in the SNAP Trial of novel paracetamol treatment regimens 
to identify potential liver injury in patients taking paracetamol in 
overdose ( Bateman et al., 2014 ).
Study protocol
Participants were randomly assigned to receive either 1 g parace -
tamol 4× daily (the maximum recommended daily dose and a 
commonly prescribed dose for chronic pain in the UK) or 
matched placebo for 2 weeks. Following a 2-week washout 
period, participants crossed over to the other treatment arm for 
an additional 2 weeks of treatment. The treatment order was 
randomized, with concealed allocation, using a random block 
design, and participants were assigned to receive drug then pla -
cebo, or placebo then drug. Blood samples were taken at 4 visits 
during each arm of the study (days 0 [pretreatment] 4, 7, and 14). 
All researchers and participants were blinded to treatment 
throughout the study.
Study outcomes
Study outcomes included standard clinical biochemistry parame -
ters. ALT was measured in the NHS Lothian Biochemistry 
Laboratory. Total K18 (necrosis and apoptosis related forms) was 
measured using the Peviva M65 classic ELISA (Bioaxxes, 
Tewkesbury, UK). miR-122 was measured by PCR. GLDH was 
measured by its oxoglutarate reduction activity. Details of the 
biomarker measurement is described in the Supplementary 
Methods.
Statistical analysis
Data were statistically analyzed with GraphPad Prism 10 soft -
ware (La Jolla, California). The fifth and 95th quartiles were 
derived to calculate reference intervals for each biomarker. 
Statistical significance for the performance of each biomarker 
was determined by Wilcoxon test. Pearson correlation was 
reported to evaluate the biomarkers in the context of ALT levels.
Results
In the PATH-BP trial, a total of 204 participants were screened 
and 103 subjects were randomized onto the study between 
September 2014 and June 2019 ( MacIntyre et al., 2022 ). 
Supplementary Figure 1 presents the change in ALT activity in 
204 | K18 and DILI  
103 randomized trial participants on placebo and paracetamol 
treatment. Of these 103 patients, 49 patients reached the prede -
fined inclusion criteria of a greater than 50% increase in ALT 
activity from baseline on paracetamol treatment. The demo -
graphics of these 49 patients are presented in Table 1, alongside 
the 103 patients that were randomized into the PATH-BP trial. 
There were no substantial differences between the entire trial 
population and the substudy. In the 49 patients who reached the 
inclusion criteria, the median peak fold increase from baseline in 
ALT was 2.2 (IQR1.8–2.9, range 1.5–6.9). In the placebo arm, only 
8 of the 49 patients had a 50% increase in ALT. Baseline values 
were comparable for all biomarkers when participants received 
paracetamol first (paracetamol then placebo baseline: ALT 21.3 ± 
7.2U/l V 23.6 ± 10.4U/l, K18 11.4 ± 5.5 ng/ml V 11.6 ± 5.7 ng/ml, 
miR-122 4.6 ± 3.2fM V 4.9 ± 2.6fM and GLDH 8.7 ± 4.8U/l V 9.7 ± 
2.9U/l) and when placebo was received first (placebo then para -
cetamol baseline: ALT 20.9 ± 7.6U/l V 18.6 ± 4.3U/l, K18 10.4 ± 
4.4 ng/ml V 10.7 ± 4.3 ng/ml, miR-122 3.8 ± 2.4fM V 3.2 ± 2.1fMm, 
and GLDH 7.3 ± 2.4U/l V 8.0 ± 2.4U/l).
The 3 novel biomarkers (K18, miR-122, and GLDH)—that were 
previously identified as being the optimal panel for DILI identifi -
cation after acute paracetamol overdose ( Llewellyn et al., 2021 ) 
were measured in the paracetamol and placebo arms of the 49 
patients with an ALT increase with chronic paracetamol dosing 
(Figure 1). The concentration of GLDH was below the lower limit 
of detection (<5 U/l) in 261 out of 392 samples and these samples 
were excluded from the analysis. All 3 novel biomarkers were 
increased on the day of peak ALT (K18 paracetamol arm: 18.9 ± 
9.7 ng/ml V placebo arm: 11.1 ± 5.4 ng/ml, ROC-AUC ¼ 0.80, 95% 
CI 0.71–0.89, p < .0001, miR-122 15.1 ± 12.9fM V 4.9 ± 4.7fM, ROC- 
AUC ¼ 0.83, 95% CI 0.75–0.91, p < .0001, and GLDH 24.6 ± 31.1U/l V 
12.0 ± 11.8U/l, ROC-AUC ¼ 0.66, 95% CI 0.49–0.83, p ¼ .09) 
(Figure 2). All 3 biomarkers had a significant correlation with ALT 
activity: K18 Pearson r ¼ 0.68 (95% CI 0.56–0.77); miR-122 r ¼ 0.68 
(0.55–0.77); GLDH r ¼ 0.6 (0.37–0.77) (Figure 2).
In the setting of acute single paracetamol overdose and stag -
gered overdose, multiple studies have demonstrated that K18 
and miR-122 can identify patients who will develop liver injury 
before ALT has increased ( Dear et al., 2018 ). In this study, we had 
a population of patients with an ALT increase following chronic 
therapeutic dosing of paracetamol with a placebo arm to control 
for fluctuations in biomarker concentration which are unrelated 
to the study drug. Next, we compared the performance of the 3 
novel biomarkers with ALT with regard to distinguishing parace -
tamol from placebo treatment at the visit preceding the peak 
ALT increase (mean 3 days prior to peak ALT). ROC curve analysis 
demonstrated that K18 had the highest sensitivity and specificity 
with regard to predicting an increase in ALT (K18 ROC- 
AUC ¼ 0.70, 95% CI 0.59–0.80, p ¼ .001; miR-122 ROC-AUC ¼ 0.60, 
95% CI 0.49–0.72, p ¼ .08, ALT ROC-AUC ¼ 0.59, 95% CI 0.48–0.70, 
p ¼ .12; GLDH ROC-AUC ¼ 0.70, 95% CI 0.50–0.90, p ¼ .08) 
(Figure 3).
Published studies have reported higher variability in miR-122 
than other DILI biomarkers ( Church et al., 2019 ). Therefore, we 
assessed the inter and intravariability of ALT and the 3 novel bio -
markers in the placebo arm of the trial (Table 2). Intrasubject 
variability was determined using the placebo arm data across the 
4 time points—ALT had the lowest variability (12.9% CV). 
Intersubject variability was similar for ALT and K18 (42.9%). miR- 
122 variability was higher both intrasubject (30.6%) and intersub -
ject (74.1%). This is lower than reported by Church et al. (2019)
(90.9% intersubject CV and 93.6% intrasubject CV). Variability in 
GLDH was not calculated given the high number of samples with 
unmeasurably low activity.
Discussion
This article presents the results of a biomarker analysis conducted

trial of paracetamol therapeutic dosing ( MacIntyre et al., 2022 ).

trial with an investigational medicinal product that has a potential 
for causing DILI. The data reveal that there was an increase in ALT 
activity in patients receiving paracetamol compared with their 
treatment with placebo. The study evaluated 3 novel biomarkers 
selected based on their performance in the context of paracetamol 
overdose and found that K18 has most potential for predictive pur -
poses and exhibited relatively low variability.
This study was conducted as a substudy of the PATH-BP trial, 
in which 110 individuals were randomized to receive 1 g parace -
tamol 4 times daily or a matched placebo for 2 weeks, followed 
by a 2-week washout period before crossing over to the alternate 
treatment. The primary outcome measure was blood pressure. A 
predefined cut-off of greater than 50% increase in ALT activity 
from baseline was used to select patients for this substudy. This 
cut-off was chosen based on its prior use in the SNAP Trial as a 
measure of potential liver injury ( Bateman et al., 2014 ). Of the 110 
patients, 49 met the inclusion criteria for increased ALT activity. 
Although this cut-off increase was modest, 29 patients experi -
enced a doubling of ALT activity from baseline on paracetamol, 
and 6 patients had a 4-fold increase in ALT. Similar to the PATH- 
BP trial, previous clinical studies have reported an increase in 
ALT activity following therapeutic dosing ( Heard et al., 2014 ; 
Watkins et al., 2006 ). The significance of an increase in ALT activ -
ity during therapeutic paracetamol dosing is unclear; many of 
the patients with an ALT increase at day 7 have an ALT activity 
nearer baseline by day 14 (Supplementary Figure 1). Paracetamol 
has a dose-dependent intrinsic risk for DILI, and these ALT 
increases could be a warning of increased risk with dose 
escalation. However, clinically significant liver injury on parace -
tamol at therapeutic dosing is very rare, likely affecting only 
about 1 in 3 million patients treated for a year ( Gulmez et al., 
2015 ).
The increase in ALT observed in this study offered an opportu -
nity to assess the efficacy of novel biomarkers in a multiple dos -
ing study. Among the biomarkers evaluated was K18, which is a 
mechanistic biomarker of liver injury and provides information 
on the type of cell death. In apoptosis, the caspase-cleaved form 
of K18 (cc-K18) is released early during cellular structural rear -
rangement, whereas in necrosis, the full-length form of K18 (FL- 
K18) is passively released upon cell death. As paracetamol- 
induced liver injury is predominantly necrotic with a component 
of apoptosis, total K18 was evaluated to identify liver injury. 
Another biomarker evaluated was miR-122, a 22-nucleotide 
microRNA that is highly specific to the liver and is released from 
necrotic hepatocytes, resulting in elevated concentrations in the 
bloodstream ( Starkey Lewis et al., 2011 ). Although miR-122 is an 
early marker of liver-specific damage, its use may be limited due 
to higher inter- and intraindividual variability and a potentially 
short half-life ( Church et al., 2019 ). Glutamate dehydrogenase 
(GLDH) was evaluated as an early marker of liver-specific mito -
chondrial damage ( McGill et al., 2012 ). The results showed 
that all 3 novel biomarkers increased when measured at the visit 
with peak ALT on paracetamol compared with the same 
visit on placebo treatment and correlated with ALT. This is con -
sistent with published data on paracetamol and non- 
paracetamol DILI.

randomized trial) (D–F). Each line is a patient. The solid line is the population median. Population presented are patients from PATH-BP Trial with a 
50% or more increase in peak ALT from baseline on paracetamol treatment. The concentration of GLDH was below the lower limit of detection (<5 U/l) 
in 261 out of 392 samples and these samples were excluded from the analysis.
206 | K18 and DILI  
Serum samples collected prospectively in PATH-BP allowed 
testing whether any of the 3 markers were increased (compared 
with placebo) on the visit preceding the peak ALT increase, which 
was, on average, 3 days prior. Only K18 showed significant pre -
dictive value when analyzed using ROC curves. This suggests 
that K18 may be useful in the early detection of DILI risk in 
patients prescribed medications known to be potentially hepato -
toxic. This finding is consistent with data from (1) patients who 
have taken a paracetamol overdose, which shows that K18 is a 
sensitive and specific predictor of subsequent liver injury despite 
treatment, and (2) from a trial of hospitalized volunteers given 
paracetamol for 7 days ( Thulin et al., 2014 ). This latter study did 
not have a placebo arm unlike PATH-BP, which provides evidence 
that the change in ALT is paracetamol-induced and not related 
to other trial related factors such as dietary changes.
In the setting of paracetamol overdose, miR-122 is a sensitive 
early biomarker of liver injury. The reduction in performance 
compared with K18 in this study may reflect the small peak ALT 
values (and less cell injury) and/or the higher variability of miR- 
122. However, the variability we report in this article is lower 
than previous reports and may not be significant when more 
hepatocellular injury is present (such as paracetamol hepatotox -
icity). GLDH has been repeatedly demonstrated to have lower 
sensitivity compared with both K18 and miR-122 in acute 
overdose studies, consistent with the current study in repeated 
dosing.
There are limitations to this study. For this study, the 
increases in ALT were modest, however, it is probable that K18 
would also predict more significant liver injury. This has been 
demonstrated in repeated studies following acute paracetamol 
overdose ( Dear et al., 2018 ). We did not measure marker concen -
trations in those patients without an increase in ALT on parace -
tamol treatment. However, the markers are well-established to 
distinguish patients with and without DILI in both paracetamol 
overdose and idiosyncratic injury. The assays used in this study 
are research laboratory based and not optimized for clinical prac -
tice (eg, the time to result is too long for acute decision-making), 
though point-of-care assays are in development. However, 
whether biomarker performance is maintained on different plat -
forms remains to be confirmed. GLDH was below the limit of

assay detection in 261 out of 392 samples. This limited conclu -
sions about GLDH performance and higher sensitivity assays 
may improve biomarker performance in the context of early DILI 
diagnosis.
In summary, K18 was more sensitive than ALT, miR-122, and 
GLDH and has potential for the early identification of potential 
DILI in clinical trials.
