Abstract
As a major source of plastic pollution,PEThasattractedsignificantinterestfor biodegradation
due to its potential inthecircular economy.Finding effectiveenzymesstill remainsachallenge
as screening methods are limited by either the low throughput or dependence on alternative
non-PET substrates due to PET’s insolubility. Here, we report a highly active, stable and
robust enzyme, Fast_2.9, identified while directly screening for PET-degrading activity in
mesophilic conditions using droplet-based encapsulation of PET nanoparticles with the
throughput above 1 kHz. We identified a distal S269T mutation that improves activity in the
majority of all known PETases with up to 400 times over wildtype, and more than twice of
known engineeredPETases,astestedonuntreatedpost-consumer plastics.Microsecondtime
scale molecular dynamics analyses indicate that this distant mutation possibly influences
residues near the substrate-binding cleft via a common mechanism across PETases.
Compared to the state-of-the-art FastPETase and LCCICCG enzymes,theengineeredFast_2.9
enzyme requires up to 8 and 42 times lower enzyme concentrations to reach the same
enzymatic activity, ultimately requiring significantly less enzyme. As such our engineered
enzyme degrades multiple post-consumer PET substrates, including polyester textiles, within
as least as just 2 days with up to nearly 100% terephthalic acid conversion using as little as
0.72 mgenzyme/gPET at 50℃. Our study presents a universal methodology for directscreeningof
insoluble substrates at ultra-high-throughput and highlights the techno-economic potential of
Fast_2.9for PETdepolymerisation.

Introduction
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a widely used plastic inour dailylives,and itaccountsfor
over 10% of the world's solid waste with a major portion originating from polyester textiles1.
Micro and nano plastics could enter human bodies, and a recent study showed that those
plastic particles in blood vessels might be linkedtoahigher riskofheartdisease2.Althoughit
was considered non-biodegradable,thediscoveryof IsPETase3 andcutinases 4 hasshed light
on its potential biodegradation processes that could potentially be reintegrated into a circular
carbon economy via rapid enzymatic depolymerization of PET, with subsequent
repolymerization or transformation into various valuable products5–7. As a consequence, the
scientific community rushed to search for new PET degrading enzymes8–12 (>100 enzymes
have been identified according to the Plastics-Active Enzymes Database - PAZy13), and to
engineer existing ones to enhance the activity, especiallyIsPETase through rational design
10,14,15 anddirectedevolution 16.For instance,ThermoPETase 17 wasgeneratedthroughrational
design, FastPETase18 and DuraPETase18,19 were produced using computational methods,
whileHotPETase 20 andDepoPETase 21 wereidentifiedusingdirectedevolution.
A traditional methodfor improvingenzymefunctionistousedirected evolutionbystartingfrom
a natural protein anditerativelymakingasmall number ofmutationsuntil theenzymeacquires
the desired properties22,23. The combination of microfluidics and fluorescence cytometry has
proven to be highly successful for this24–28,especially for secretedenzymes 29 andsubstrates
that cannot cross the cell membrane 30 with sufficient throughput. However, significant
challenges remain when performing the directed evolution of PET-degradingenzymes.These
include the extremely low water solubility of the PET substrate and the lack of mapping
between PETase variants (i.e. genotypes) and absorbance or fluorescence (i.e. phenotypes)
for easy detection. Few approaches have been developed for the directed evolution of PET
degradation enzymes to overcome suchobstacles.However,thesemethodsaremostlyoflow
throughput or use alternative substrates other than PET20,21. InthecaseofHotPETase,solid
PET discs were used in 96-well plates21, and approximately 2000 samples were laboriously
analysed using HPLC every two days. Qiao et al 16 developed a microfluidic-based high
throughput screening approach for PETase discovery but usingsubstratesother thanPET.As
such, coupling fluorescence signals directly to enzymatic plastic polymer depolymerization in
high-throughput still poses substantial challenges. For instance, Zurier et al31 developed a
microplate-basedscreeningmethod for PETasemutantsbyaddingFe(II) inthe PEThydrolysis
solution and measuring the fluorescence of the 2-hydroxyterephthalic acid (hTA) with a
spectrophotometer 31. hTA is the product from the coupling reaction of TPA with hydroxyl
radicals, and it has excitation/emission wavelengths at 310/420 nm32,33, which is out of the
range of commonly used flow cytometry, thuslimitingitsmeasurementsto spectrophotometry.
On the other hand, to overcome the obstacles associated withlinkinggenotypetophenotype,
biosensors 26,34 are frequently employed. Notably, for PET degradation studies, transcription
factor (TF)-based biosensors35,36 have been developed to detect itsmonomer TPA,offeringa
promisingtool for monitoringenzymaticactivityandsubstrateinteractiondirectly.
Here we developed a microfluidics platform to enable high-throughput screening of PETase
activity directly using PET as a substrate by encapsulating PET nanoparticles into droplets.
We engineered the Escherichia coli strain to efficiently secrete PETase and convert the
resulting monomer yield into a measurable GFP signal using a genome-integrated TPA

biosensor. We successfully applied our platform to screen a random mutagenesis library of
IsPETase, resulting in >20% of sorted cells with increased activities, among which a variant
with single mutation S269T (named as M2.9 in the following context) showed the highest
increase of catalytic activity of 22-fold compared withIsPETase. We further discovered a
universal activity enhancing effect of this mutation in various IsPETase variants
(ThermoPETase, FastPETase, HotPETase and DepoPETase), especially for FastPETase, its
S269 mutant (named as Fast_2.9 in the following context) exhibited 144% increasement in
monomer yield using untreated postconsumer PET substrate at 50°C and pH 8.Microsecond
time scale molecular dynamics analyses suggest that this distant mutation likely stabilises
conformations accommodating the substrate, by influencing residues near the
substrate-binding cleft via a common PETase mechanism. When benchmarking against
non-pretreated postconsumer PET, Fast_2.9 showed up to 8 and 42 times lower of reverse
Michaelis-Menten kinetic InvKm, compared to FastPETase and LCCICCG 4 respectively, while
InvKcat values remained similar. Using just 0.72 mg enzyme ・ gPET
-1 of enzymes towards
non-pretreated postconsumer PET substrate in 15 ml bioreactor, Fast_2.9 achieved 97.4 ±
1.43% of depolymerisation and 95.9 ± 1.4% of TPA content by the end of 72 h, compared to
77.0 ± 4.74% depolymerisation and 55.4 ± 0.1% TPA content for LCCICCG.Finally,weshowed
that Fast_2.9 is also capable of degrading polyester textiles with over 75% depolymerisation
rateyieldingupto90%TPAmonomer after 3 days.
Results
Engineering the strain for sensing TPA and secreting PETases
We started by engineering the E.coli BL21 (DE3) strain carrying a transcriptional factor
(TF)-based TPA biosensor 36 (Supplementary Table 1) that would convert the PET
depolymerisation catalytic efficiency into a fluorescence signal for subsequent screening(Fig.
1a). To warrant the stable expression of the biosensor37, instead of using plasmids, we
integrated the TPA biosensor into eight genomic loci using CRISPR-based multicopy
chromosomal integration approach 38 (Fig. 1b). After three rounds of transformation, the
biosensor was combinatorially integrated into four genomic locations resulting in six
combinations ranging from a single copy (locus 2 and 4) up to four copies integrated intoloci
2, 4, 5, 6 (loci 2456 strain) (Methods, SupplementaryTable 2).Toensurethatthebiosensor is
responsive to our defined dynamic range of TPA concentrations, all sixstrainsweretestedby
submerging them to TPA concentrations of 0, 1 and 5 mM, with the intention to detect even
minor substrate concentration differences (Fig. 1c). The loci 45 strain showed the most
significant sensitivity capable of distinguishing 1 mMand5mMconcentrations(Welch'st-test,
p-value<2.2e-16).
To corroborate whether theIsPETase enzyme was secreted and active in those strains, we
transformed eachstrainwith theplasmid-basedT7-inducible IsPETase containingaN-terminal
secretion signal peptide (Supplementary Table3).In the strainswhereeither locus2or 6was
targeted, no catalytic activity towards either PET or ρ-nitrophenyl acetate (a substrate for
esterase activity) was 39 observed in the cell lysate or supernatant (Supplementary Fig. 1).
This effectwasindependentoftheuse ofexpressionmediums(wetestedIPTG-supplemented
induction and autoinduction mediums) (Supplementary Fig. 2). With both the TPA biosensor

and secretedIsPETase functioning well, we continued with the loci 45 strain harbouring the
pET21b-IsPETase plasmid,whichisreferredtoasG-TPAsensor strainin thefollowingcontext,
unlessotherwisespecified.
We found that the fluorescence shift of the cell populations of G-TPAsensor in 0,1and5mM
TPA remains significant after 48 hours cultivation (Fig. 1d), which confirms the biosensor’s
functionality in long-term cultivation with plasticssubstrateandmakesitsuitablefor identifying
highly active mutants. Next, we cultivated theG-TPAsensor cellsinthepresenceof0,2.5and
5 g/L PET nanoparticles (PET-NP) (made from amorphous PET, Methods) supplemented
medium. The accumulations of monomers in 0, 2.5 and 5 g/L PET-NPexhibitedlinear growth
in the first 48 hours and then increased slowly. 291 ± 2.4 μM and 645 ± 3.97 μM TPA were
produced after 48 h (2.5 and 5 g/L PET, respectively), furthermore validating the functionality
oftheengineeredstrain(Fig.1e).

Accelerating PETase evolution in droplets
In order to cultivate the G-TPAsensor cells with PET substrate together within droplets, the
PET substrate must be made into water-suspended nanoparticles. We first investigated the
impact of nanoparticlepreparationonPETsubstrate crystallinity 40,crucial for catalyticrates41,
by employing two methods in the Non-Solvent Induced Phase Separation (NIPS) process
using hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP)42 and trifluoroacetic acid (TFA)43 assolvents(Methods).
We found that the PET nanoparticles obtained with TFA (PET-NP-TFA) method showed over
double increased crystallinity as measured by differential scanning calorimetry (from 3.8% to
10.3%), while the PET-NP prepared with HFIP (PET-NP-HFIP) has had only 10% crystallinity
increase (from 3.8% to 4.2%) comparing to the starting material (GoodFellow PET film,
Methods). FT-IR analysis 44 also confirmed that the PET-NP-TFA has a higher crystalline
conformation ratio with 52.5% increase of A1340/A1372 ratio and 20.0% decrease of
A1475/A1457 ratio (1457 and 1373 cm−1 have been associated withthegauche conformation
of PET, while 1475 and 1340 cm−1 increase in intensity during crystallisation due totrans)
(Supplementary Fig. 3a and Supplementary Table 4). Therefore, we continued with the
PET-NP-HFIPbyencapsulatingnanoparticlesintowater-in-oil-droplets(Methods).
We then encapsulated PET nanoparticles (diameter <500 nm, Supplementary Fig. 4) in
water-in-oil droplets as a substrate together with IsPETase library to enable subsequent
high-throughput PETase activity screening (Fig. 2a). Single cells from IsPETase random
mutagenesis library (~2 x 106 clones) were encapsulated with PET NP within water-in-oil
emulsions46 (Fig. 2b top). After 48 hours of droplets cultivation off chip, we observed cells
grown together with PET-NP substrate exhibiting green fluorescence compared to negative
control (Fig. 2b). We then de-emulsified the droplets and subsequently sorted cells using a
fluorescent cell sorter. Initially, 77.1% of the cells were selected basedonsizeand complexity
criteria to exclude oversized or abnormal cells (Fig. 2c). Then, from this population, we
isolated 192 cells with the highest green fluorescentprotein(sfGFP) expression(Fig.2d).The

was run in triplicate, and data are shown as mean ± SD. Mean values of released monomers for each sample are

In total 192 variants were sorted out onto the LB agar and, of which 167 (86.9%) grew
successfully on the sorting plate. Of these, 34 (20.3%) displayed greater catalytic efficiency
than wildtype (Fig. 2e). We selected the top 12 of these 34 variants for sequencing
(Supplementary Table 2) and further analysis. These 12 variantswerepurifiedandretestedto
confirmthattheir increased activitywasdue tohigher catalyticefficiencyandnotmerelydueto
elevated expression or secretion. Out of these, 6 variants showed significantly enhanced
catalytic activities, with variant M2.9 (S269T) displaying the highestactivityresultingin 22fold
increase over WTIsPETase variant (Fig. 2f). Variants M2.3 and M2.8, exhibited enhanced
activity compared to the wild type in the supernatant assay. Yet, when purified, their activities
were below that of theIsPETase wild type, likely due to the expression efficiency changes
causedbythemutations 35,36,47–49.
To evaluate the catalyticefficiencyofM2.9webenchmarkeditagainstFastPETase 18,whichis
known for its high efficiency among all IsPETase variants. 200 nM of FastPETase,IsPETase
and M2.9 were mixed with 19.2 g/L PET nanoparticles at 30, 40, 50 and 60℃for 48 h (Fig.
2g). M2.9 showed the highest activity at 30 and 40°C, producing 29.0±0.526mMand22.7±
1.23 mM monomers, respectively. This represented increases of 20% and 13% over
FastPETase, and 54% and 130% overIsPETase. A decrease in catalyticefficiencyfrom30to
60°C was noted for all enzymes, withIsPETase and M2.9 displayingfaster declinesat50 and
60°C compared to FastPETase, indicating that M2.9 is better suitedfor mesophilicconditions.
Additionally, we tested M2.9’s activity on PET film from non-pretreated lids of postconsumer
yoghurt containers (Supplementary Table 4). After incubating a 6 mm-diameter PET discwith
200nMoftheenzymesat30°Cfor 48hours,M2.9 produced2.96±0.753mMofmonomers,a
219% increase over the wild-typeIsPETase (Fig. 2h). A more severe surface abrasion was
also observed under optical and scanning electron microscopy analyses (Supplementary Fig.
5).
Molecular dynamics and structural analysis of PETases
Residue 269 is located on the α7 helix of the surface of the protein ~28 Å away opposingly
from the active site consisting of residues Ser160, Asp206, and His23750 (Fig. 3a). Although

the protein’s stability due to their similar properties, nonetheless, there are cases in other
enzymes where the distant mutation from Serine to Threonine enhanced enzymatic activity,
and also PETaseS242T that exhibited up to 2.5 increased activity compared with WTIsPETase
51,52.
To investigate the molecular effects of S269T mutation, we performed exhaustive molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations, running 1 μs per replicate (n=5 per enzyme variant) allowing
sufficient time for the mutation’s effects to propagate through thesystem(Methods).To locate
the regions whose dynamics were affected by the mutation, we started by examining per
residue weighted Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF) profiles of the backbone atoms. As
expected, most of the RMSF profile overlapped between the wild typeIsPETase and S269T
mutant simulations, with the exception of the following regions: the loops formed by residues
88 to 91 (unpaired t-test, BH adj. p-value = 0.0264), residue 112 to 115 (unpaired t-test, BH
adj. p-value = 0.0287) and residue 238 to 241 (unpaired t-test, BH adj. p-value=0.0102). The
region formed by residues 88 to 91 is both close to the active site and is involved in the
formation of the active cleft where the substrate binds and has been shown to be a key
difference betweenIsPETaseand other membersoftheα/β-foldhydrolases 53 (Fig.3b).

correlation paths estimated by WISP. The node edges indicate the detected paths, with width proportional to the
frequency of the connection appearing in the top 10 paths.
Given the high sequence similarity between IsPETase and FastPETase, particularly the
identical residues from 88 to 91 in bothenzymes,we hypothesisedthattheS269Tmutationin
FastPETase might act through the same mechanism and produce similar effects asobserved
in IsPETase. To investigate this, we performed molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for both
FastPETase and its mutantFast_2.9,eachlasting1 µswithfivereplicates.The simulationsfor
both enzymes were prepared and analysed using the same methodology applied to the
IsPETase simulations, with the sole difference beingtheir optimal temperature(Methods).The
per residue weighted RMSF profiles of FastPETase and Fast_S269T displayed the same
stabilising behaviour as the one observed for IsPETase (unpaired t-test, BH adj.
p-value=0.0161) (Fig.3c).
To corroborate if the lower fluctuations observed in the region of residues 88 to 91 for the
S269T mutants are due to a stabilisation of the crystallographic orientation or due to a new
conformation, the RootMeanSquareDeviation(RMSD) ofthebackboneatomsofresidues88
to 91 was analysed. To properly capture different conformations with respect to the crystal
structure and not merely internal orientations of the loop, we aligned all simulation frames to
the crystal structure using the C-alpha carbons of all residues except for 88 to 91. Following
this alignment, we computed the RMSD for the backbone of residues 88 to 91 without
additional realignment. We then generated a probabilitydensitydistributionbycombiningdata
from all replicates. For bothIsPETase and FastPETase, the S269T mutants showed a higher
preference for conformations resembling thecrystallographicstructure,suggestingthatS269T
mutantactsbystabilisingthisconformation(Fig.3d).
We then aligned the previously reported structure ofIsPETase with a hydroxyethyl-capped
PET dimer docked53,54 witharepresentativestructureofthe loopconformationsdisplayinglow
deviations with the crystallographic pose (Fig. 3d, RMSD≃1.5 Å) and a representative

hypothesise that the increased activity observed in bothIsPETase and FastPETase resulting
from the S269T mutation is attributed to the stabilisation of conformations that better
accommodatethepolymer substrate.
Since S269 is structurally close to C273 (~4.8 Å), which forms a disulfide bond (DS2) with
C289 (Supplementary Fig. 6a), we also investigated the DS2 and its possible interaction with
S269. Although we did not find any direct evidence indicating the correlation between S269
and DS2, instead we found that the DS2 could possibly be partially reduced (Supplementary
Figs. 6b, 7, 8), and the absence of DS2 did not significantlyaffecttheactivityofIsPETase but
caused almost complete loss of activity in FastPETase (Supplementary Fig. 6c).Weinfer that
in the WTIsPETase,theDS2islikelytoplayaregulatoryrather thanstructural roleandfurther
studieswill beneededtoclarifyfunctions(See also inSupplementarynote).
To get insights how the effect from S269T mutation may be traversing to ~28 Å away active
site, we analysed the shortest residue C-alpha fluctuation correlation paths connecting
mutation to the residues of the active cleft using Weighted Implementation of Suboptimal
Paths (WISP) method55. As suggested by WISP analysis (Methods), the effect of mutation
seems to propagate from the α7 helix to the α1 helix, then to the α2 helix and finally to the
active cleft most commonly involving residues THR88, ALA89, SER93, ILE94 and TRP97
(blueresiduesinFig.3g).
S269T enhances enzymatic activity across known PETases
As suggested by molecular dynamics analysis, we introduced the S269T mutation to
FastPETase, an enzyme that is known to be active at higher temperatures18, to assess its
effect on PETase activity. The mutated Fast_S269T variant showed enhanced catalytic
efficiency across a pH range of 6-10, notably doubling its performance at pH 8 compared to
FastPETase (Supplementary Fig. 9). Analogously, we applied the same S269T mutation to
other IsPETase variants, i.e., ThermoPETase, HotPETase and DepoPETase, to see if this
mutation exhibited universal effects (Fig. 4a). Similarly as with FastPETase, catalytic
enhancements were observed in ThermoPETase across 30, 40 and 50℃ in pH 8 and 9
conditions. For HotPETase and DepoPETase, significant increases were only observed for its
S269T variant at 50 °C pH 9 conditions (Welch's t-test, p-value=0.00324 for HotPETase and
p-value=0.0295 for DepoPETase), which possibly could be attributed to the structural
differencesofHotPETaseand DepoPETase,whichcontain21 20 and721 mutationsrespectively,
compared toIsPETase. The highest effects are observed in FastPETaseoverall showingover
430-fold increase of activity compared to wild typeIsPETase performance at 50℃and we
named thisenzyme Fast_2.9 (Fig.4a).
To access Fast_2.9 performance, we included LCCICCG, a highly efficient enzyme tested in
industrial scales56. Since FastPETase and Fast_2.9 loses activity at 60°C (data not shown),
we compared monomer production after 48h at temperatures 30, 40 and 50°C and pH levels
of 8 or 9, revealing that Fast_2.9 is most effective at milder temperatures of 50 °C and pH 8,
where it released 2.01 and 2.79 times more monomer FastPETase and LCCICCG, respectively
(Fig. 4a). Given these results, Fast_2.9 shows promise as a candidate for large-scale
applications, especially at temperatures around 50°C,aligningwell withthethermal properties
of polymer, as isothermal crystallisation could possibly occur when the temperature is above

Fast_2.9, FastPETase and LCCICCG kinetics using the inverse Michaelis–Menten approach14
using a range of enzyme concentrations. For all experiments, we used a unprocessed
post-consumer PET substrate at 12 g/L across all conditions (Methods), with enzyme

Most transparent PET bottles are mechanically recycled in developed countries, but not
coloured containers 63. Therefore we also evaluated how Fast_2.9 could degrade untreated
coloured opaque postconsumer PET containers with just 0.72 mgenzyme・gPET
–1 of enzyme
usage. Under identical conditions, 97.6% of PET was degraded within 66 hours leaving only
the green pigment in the reaction container (Fig. 4e, 4f, Supplementary Video) demonstrating
Fast_2.9suitabilityfor TPArecoveryfromnon-transparentPETwaste.
Approximately 60% of the PET produced is usedinthetextileindustry,while~30%isusedin

we pretreated 3 types of polyester textiles with extruding, quenching and grinding (Fig. 4g),
and then incubated with Fast_2.9. By the end of 72 hours ofincubation,thedepolymerisation
rate reached77.2±1.6%,77.4±1.1%and75.1 ±1.8%respectively,whichisalsoclose tothe
substrate weight loss of 79.7 ± 4.0%，81.8 ± 2.8% and 85.9 ± 4.0%, as measured by
lyophilization weight loss (Fig. 4h). And similar to PET bottle degradation in Fig. 4d, the TPA
ratio in total monomers increased in the last 24 hours, which reached 89.9 ± 1.8%, 89.2 ±
9.5%and74.4±4.0%respectively(Fig.4h).
Discussion
In this study we presented a novel droplet-based ultra-high throughput screening approach
that enables direct use of insoluble PET substrates for directed PETase evolution to surpass
previous limitations of low throughput screening. We engineered the strain using a biosensor
that is TPA specific35 and transformed PET into nanoparticles to allow directly to sense PET
degradationwithoutrelyingonalternativesubstratesthatarenotrelatedtodepolymerisationof
PET16. Through screening a million-sized libraryatmesophilic30°Ctemperature,we identified
eight mutants that enhancedIsPETaseactivity,with the mostnotableincrease,a22-fold effect
(Fig. 2f), observed with the single S269T mutation located on the α7helix,thatisdistantfrom
the active site(Fig.3a).WeintroducedtheS269TmutationintoknownPETasesand observed
a general trendofactivation,mostpronouncedinFastPETase(Fig.4a).Theresultingenzyme,
Fast_2.9, achieved a 430-fold increase in activity over the wild type at 50°C using untreated
post-consumer substrate(Fig 4a).
To explore the underlying mechanisms, we conducted extensive molecular dynamics
simulations as distal mutations might influence protein structure and dynamics through
long-range effects, potentially leading to allosteric impacts on enzymatic catalysis 66–69.
Molecular trajectory analysis revealed that the ~28Å distance is mediated by interactions
involving residues that connect to the β3-α2 loop,stabilising residuesY87,T88,and A89(Fig.
3c, 3g). Notably, Austin et al53 found that the substrate binding cleft ofIsPETaseincludesT88
and S238, while Guo and colleagues70 demonstrated that T88 and A89 are crucial for
interacting with the PET polymer, such that mutations Y87H, Y87E, T88H,andA89Hresulted
in a significant loss of activity, underscoring the critical roles these residues play in enzyme
function. Similar to IsPETase and M2.9, we found the same global change pattern for
FastPETaseandFast_2.9(Fig.3c,3d,3e,3f).

PET typically has a glass transition temperature (Tg) starting from 67°C for amorphousPET,
meaning reactions at higher temperatures can lead to increase of PET crystallinity71 thereby
preventing PETase catalysis.Despite thatadditiveslikeplasticizersandexposureto water can
lower its Tg 72,73 still it is important to consider these as PET may recrystallize if the
environmental temperature exceedsitsTg74.For instance,Thomsenandcolleaguesobserved
that the Tg of amorphous PET disks decreasedfrom75°Cto60°Cafter a24-hour pre-soakin
water at 65°C41. In fact, Arnal et al testedtheenzymevariantLCCICCG,avariantknownfor its
high efficiencyinindustrial applications,atalower temperatureof68°Cinsteadof72°C,taking
into account the thermal properties of PET56. Our results show that Fast_2.9 has higher
activities thanFastPETaseat30-50 ℃(Fig.4a,4b) andindifferentpH(SupplementaryFig.9),
also outperforming LCCICCG in temperature ranges 30-50℃(Fig. 4b), and thus aligning well
with the thermal properties of PET and making overall favourable process economy in
mesophilictemperatures.
Inverse Michaelis-Menten kinetics analysis of the three enzymes with 12 g/L postconsumer
PET plastics showed that Fast_2.9 has the lowestInvKm, which could be attributed to the
substrate binding cleft stabilisation by S269T for better substrate binding(Fig.3).LowerInvKm
means lower enzyme usage, lowering costs of enzymaticcatalysis,whereasthelowaffinityof
LCCICCG, as previously suggested,could potentiallylimititswideindustrial adoption75.Assuch,
we showed that as little 0.72 mgenzyme・gPET
–1ofFast_2.9isneededfor nearly100%conversion
into TPA of multiple postconsumer PET (both transparent and coloured opaque products)
within just 48hours,which is28%lessenzymeamountthantheoptimised 1mg enzyme・gPET
–1for
LCCICCG 56 and 64% less than the recently reported 2 mgenzyme・gPET
–1 for TurboPETase14.
Minimising enzyme usage in this process plays a critical role in enhancing the transformation
of PET waste into high-value products, thereby contributing to the overall valueenhancement
of this recycling pathway. High conversion rate from raw PET to TPA rather than MHET is
needed to achieve the circular biorecycling and is preferable to be done by a single enzyme.
Here we showed the potential of Fast_2.9 acting as MHETase76 and achieved 95.9% TPA
content in the total monomers. Similar function has been observed in the variant
IsPETaseS92K/D157E/R251A 77,however theexactcontentvaluewasnotreported. Furthermore,in all
our experiments except for textile degradation, we used post-consumer PET from
customer-used bottles and containers directly, without any pre-treatments such as heating,
grinding 18, acid and base treatments 7879, which underscores the application potential of
Fast_2.9. In this study, secondhand polyester textiles were the only material subjected to
pretreatment. These textiles typically exhibit higher crystallinity and contain more additives
compared to food-grade bottles or containers. Initial attempts to directly degrade the raw
textile using Fast_2.9 showed limited efficiency (datanotshown).However,byincorporatinga
pretreatment step followed by enzymatic degradation at 50°C, we demonstrated the
effectiveness of Fast_2.9 in recycling textile waste. This method achieved over 77%
depolymerization and 74.4-90% end-to-end TPA production, highlighting its potential for
sustainabletextilewastemanagement.
The resulting high activity, low substrate-enzyme ratio of Fast_2.9 and effectiveness at mild
30-50℃ temperatures makes it a suitable candidate for industrial PET depolymerisation. In
PET enzymatic processing, a higher concentration of TPA is advantageous because an
additional hydrolysis step is normally needed to completely convert MHET into TPA either by
enzymatic 80 or chemical hydrolysis18. TPA can be used as a fundamental building block for
synthesising recycled virgin-like PET4 as well as for upscaled novel applications7,81. Assuch,

~96% TPA yield also justifyadvantageousindustrial suitabilityofFast_2.9over state-of-the-art
rivals (Fig. 4d). Furthermore, S269 and its derived mutants can be further enhanced through
iterativecyclesofour presented droplet-basedenzymeevolutionwithsubstratenano-particles.
Overall, we foresee this technology as a general method that can beappliedfor developing a
broad range of biocatalysts acting on water insoluble solid substrates including other
environment polluting plastic polymers 82. Accelerated enzyme evolution has once again
transformed previously challenging enzymes, now, into potential drivers of the plastic circular
economy.
Methods
Genomic integration of TPA biosensor inE.coli
The TPA biosensor module (Supplementary Table 1) was synthesised, cloned into pTwist
Chlor Medium copy number plasmid by TWIST Bioscience (www.twistbioscience.com) and
named pTPAsensor. Four plasmids (pDonor, pTnsABC, pQcascade-array1 and pCutamp) for
multicopy chromosomal integration using CRISPR-associated transposases (MUCICAT) were
purchased from Addgene (https://www.addgene.org). The pDonor-TPAsensor plasmid was
constructed by inserting the TPA biosensor module into the pDonor plasmid. The TPA
biosensor biomodule was amplified using the primer pair TPA sensor_pDonor_F and TPA
sensor_pDonor_R (Supplementary Table 6) and gel-purified with GeneJET Gel Extraction Kit
(Cat#K0691, Thermo Scientific). The purified PCR product was ligated into the linearized
pDonor plasmid using Gibson assembly 83, following BamHI and XbaI digestion. The
pDonor-TPAsensor plasmid was sequence-verified by Eurofins Genomics
(https://eurofinsgenomics.eu/) using the primer pair pDonor_seq_F and pDonor_seq_R after
colonyPCR.
BL21(DE3) competent cells were co-transformed with pDonor-TPAsensor and pTnsABC
plasmids. After a 1-hour recovery incubation, the transformed cells were plated on LB-agar
plates containing 100 μg/mLampicillinand50μg/mLkanamycin.TherecombinantBL21(DE3)
strain carrying pDonor-TPAsensor and pTnsABS was made chemically competent using the
Hanahan Method84 and then transformed with pQCascade-array1 plasmid. These cells were
plated on LB-agar containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin, 50 μg/mL kanamycin, and 50 μg/mL
streptomycin,andincubatedat37°Cfor 16hours,leadingtocolonygrowth.
These colonies were scraped, suspended in fresh LB medium, and a 100 μl aliquot was
re-plated on LB-agar plates containing the triple antibiotic combination and 0.1 mM IPTG to
induce transposition-related protein expression and biofilm formation. The plates were
incubated at 37 °C for an additional 16 hours. After biofilm formation, the biofilms were
scraped off, resuspended in LB medium, diluted, and plated on LB-agar with the triple
antibiotic combination and 1 mM IPTG. These inducing plates were incubated overnightat37
°C.
To enhance clonal outgrowth andintegrationefficiency,coloniesfromtheinducingplateswere
designated as Transfer 1. A subset of these colonies was streaked onto fresh LB-agar plates
with the triple antibiotics and 1 mM IPTG, then incubated overnight at 37 °C, resulting in
Transfer 2. Further transfers led to Transfer 3. Copy numbers were identified using colony
PCR or qPCRwith8primer pairs(cr1-cr8,SupplementaryTable6) targetingthegenomicsites
integratedbypQCascade-array1.

Preparation of PET nanoparticles
For the HFIP method 42, 0.58 g GoodFellow amorphous PET film (Cat#ES30-FM-000145,
GoodFellow) was dissolved in 35 mL hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) (Cat#AAA1274722,
ThermoFisher) with magnetic stirring. PET solution (10 mL) was added dropwise into500mL
ultrapure deionized water with vigorous stirring at room temperature, resulting in precipitation
of PET-NPs. For the TPA method43, one gram of PET particles was dissolved in 10 mL of
concentrated trifluoroacetic acid solution (TFA) (90% v/v) at 50 °C and stirred until complete
dissolution, which took approximately 2 h. After dissolution, the solution was left to stand
overnight. To precipitate the micro/nanoparticles, 10 mL of a diluted aqueous solution of
trifluoroacetic acid (20% v/v) was added to the initial mixture under vigorous stirring and kept
stirred for 2 hours, followed by overnight storage. The suspension was centrifuged at 2500g

medium supplemented with 2.5 g/L PET nanoparticles and 200 μg/ml ampicillin. Cells were
diluted to an OD ~0.1 to achieve an average 0.3 cell per droplet according to Poisson’s
distribution 45, based on the assumption that 1 mL of thisE. coli suspension at A600 nm = 1
would contain 5 × 10 8 cells 86. Both the cell suspension and HFE 7500
(Cat#EU-FLUO-7500-10, Emulseo) with 0.5% FluoSurf Surfactant
(Cat#EU-FSC-V10-2%-HFE7500, Emulseo) were pumped into a Co-Flow Droplet Generator
(Cat#DG-CF-35-05, Droplet Genomics) with a flow rate of 10 μL/min by Flow EZ system
(Fluigent).
The resulting 2 mL droplets were collected in a 15 mLsterilisedfalcontubeandkeptat30°C,
200 rpm for 2 days in a shaker. After 48 hours of cultivation at 30 ℃, 500 μL
1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluoro-1-octanol (Cat#370533-25G, Merck) was added into the emulsions
and mixed gently until droplets were all de-emulsified. Following this, 1 mL sterilised PBS
buffer (pH 7.0) was added and the mixture was settled for 5 min. The oil layer settled at the
bottom, with thePETnanoparticlessedimentedinthe middlelayer.The cell suspension,found
inthe upper layer,wascollectedfor FACSanalysisandsorting.
Fluorescent microscopy
Droplets were suspended with HFE 7500 oil and deposited onto glass slides for microscopic
analysis. Observations were conducted under both bright and fluorescent fields, using 20x
and40xobjectivesonaLEICADM2000microscope(LeicaMicrosystemsCMSGmbH).
Flow cytometry analysis by GUAVA easyCyte Flow Cytometer
For the functional analysis of plasmid-expressing and genomic-integrated biosensor strains,
cells were analysed using a GUAVA easyCyte Flow Cytometer (Luminex). Cells were
cultivated overnight in LB medium supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 15 μg/mL
chloramphenicol (for genomic-integrated biosensor strain, only 100 μg/mL ampicillin was
added). A 2 μL aliquot of the overnight culture was inoculated into 198 μL OnEx system 2
medium supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics in a 96-well culture plate. The cultures
were incubated at 30 °C with shaking at 700 rpm in a thermomixer for 48 hours. After 48 h
cultivation, 10 μL of each culture was further dilutedinto190μL OnExsystem2mediumin96
well round-bottom plate (Cat#262162, Nunc). All wells were analysed by GUAVA easyCyte
Flow Cytometer and 5000 cells from each well were counted. All strains were inoculated in
triplicate.

Flow cytometry analysis and cell sorting by SONY SH800S Cell
Sorter
For the flow cytometry analysis ofE.coli BL21(DE3) G-TPAsensor (locus 4 & 5), cells were
cultivatedinOnExsystem2mediumsupplementedwith0,1and5mMNa 2TPAat37 ℃for 48
h. Each sample has triplicates. After cultivation, cells were diluted with sterilised PBS and
5000eventsper samplewereanalysedbySONYSH800SCell Sorter.
For mutant library analysis and sorting, after droplets cultivation and de-emulsification, the
cells were diluted with PBS (pH 7.0) to achieve a flow cytometric event rate of approximately
3000 events/secondinaSONYSH800SCell sorter (SONYBiotechnology) equippedwitha 70
μm nozzle size sorting chip. Prior to sorting, the cell suspension was filteredthrougha 35μm
cell strainer. The cell sorter was operated at pressure level 4, utilising 488 nm excitation
lasers, with emissions measured through the FL1 filter for sfGFP fluorescence. A total of
10,000 cells from different mutagenesis libraries, along with a positive control group (E. coli
BL21(DE3) G-TPAsensor (locus 4 &5) with pET21b-IsPETaseplasmid) andanegativecontrol
group(E. coli BL21(DE3) G-TPAsensor (locus4 &5) withpET21bblankplasmid),wereinitially
analysed by plotting forward scatter area (FSC-A) against fluorescence. Groups whose
fluorescence histograms showednoleftshiftcomparedtothepositivecontrol (0.1and0.2 mM
MnCl2 groups) werepooledandsubjectedtothesortingprocedure..
The flow cytometric event rate was maintained at ~3000 events/second using the SONY
SH800S cell sorter with a 70 μm nozzle sorting chip. Cells were firstly gated by FSC-A and
side scatter area (SSC-A), and the gated cells were then further analysed for GFP
fluorescence (488 nm excitation), and cells with the fluorescence intensity were sorted onto
agar plates in a 96-well format. FACS data were processed using FlowJo software v10.8
(TreeStar). The sorted colonies were recovered in LB medium containing 100 μg/mL
ampicillin, inoculated separately, and then transferred into induction medium for enzymatic
assaysor plasmidpurificationfor sequencing.
Protein expression and purification
PET degrading enzymes and variants were expressed in chemically competentE.coli BL21
(DE3). Single colonies from freshly transformed plates were cultured overnight at 37 °C inLB
mediumcontaining100 µg/mLampicillin.A500 µLaliquotoftheovernightculturewasusedto
inoculate 50 mL of AIM TB medium (Cat#AIMTB0210, Formedium) supplemented with 100
µg/mL ampicillin. Cultures were grown at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm until reaching an
OD600 of 0.8-1.0, then incubated at 16 °C for an additional 24 hours. Cell pellets were
harvested by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 20 minutes and then fully suspended in
equilibration / binding buffer (pH 7.4, 50 mM NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl). Cell suspension was
sonicated with 10% amplitude with 1s On / 1s Off for 10-20 min. The lysates were then
centrifuged at 10,000 g for 20 minutes to separate the supernatant from the cell debris. The
soluble fraction was subjected to affinity chromatography using Talon Metal Affinity Resin
(Cat# 635504, Takara). Unbound proteins were washed off with 20 resin-bed volumes of
equilibration buffer and 5resin-bedvolumesofwashbuffer (pH7.4,50mMNaH 2PO4,300 mM
NaCl, 10 mM imidazole). Bound proteins were eluted using an elution buffer (pH 7.4, 50 mM
NaH2PO4,300mMNaCl,250mMimidazole).Theelutedproteinsweredesaltedusinga Hitrap

NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl). Protein purity was analysed by SDS-PAGE, and concentrations
weremeasured usingA280with aNanodrop (ThermoFisher).
For SDS and western blot, samples were prepared by mixing with 4x NuPage LDS sample
buffer (Cat#NP0007, ThermoFisher) and boiling for 10-minute boiling at 85°C. Subsequently,
10 μL samples, along with a Spectra Multicolor Broad Range Protein Ladder (Cat#26634,
ThermoFisher) were loaded onto 4–20% Mini-PROTEAN TGX stain-free protein gels
(Cat#4568096, Biorad) for electrophoresis, which was run at 180 V for 40 minutes. Following
electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to Trans-Blot Turbo Mini PVDF membranes
(Cat#1704156, Biorad). The membrane wasblockedfor 2hoursatroomtemperatureinPBST
(PBS + 0.1% Tween 20) with 5% milk, washed with PBST for 3 times (5 min each), and
incubated for 1 h at room temperature with 6x-His tag monoclonal antibody (HIS.H8)
(Cat#MA1-21315, ThermoFisher). After three more PBST washes, the membrane was
incubated for 1 h at room temperature with HRP conjugated anti-mouseIgG(H+L) secondary
antibodies(Cat#31430,ThermoFisher),andwashedagain withPBSTfor 3times(5 mineach),
and incubated for 5 min with West Pico plus HRP substrate (Cat#34580, ThermoFisher).
BlottedproteinswerevisualisedwithaChemiDocXRSimageanalyzer (Bio-Rad).
HPLC analysis
UPLC analysis was performed on a Thermo Fisher Dionex UHPLC-PDA-FLD LC system,
equipped with an autosampler and a PDA detector set to 240 nm. The analysis utilised a
Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18 Column (Agilent) with a stepped gradient solvent ratio method.
Mobile phase A consisted of water with 20 mM phosphoric acid, while mobile phase B was
methanol,withaconstantflowrate of1.2mL/min.A10µLsamplewasinjectedfor analysis.
Following injection, the mobile phase was initially set to 20% buffer B, then gradually
increased to 65% over 7.0 minutes toseparateTPAandMHET.Thegradientwasthenrapidly
decreased back to 20% within 6 seconds, followed by post-equilibration at 20% for 0.9
minutes, resulting in a total run time of 8.0 minutes. Peakswereidentifiedbycomparingthem
to chemical standards prepared from commercial TPA (Cat#40818, Sigma) and MHET
(Cat#BD00777875, BLDPharma). Peak areas were integrated using Dionex Chromeleon
software. With this method, TPA eluted at approximately 4.72 minutes, MHET at around 5.18
minutes,andsmall amountsofbis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate(BHET) atapproximately5.80
minutes. Standards of TPA and MHET were analysed in each batch. TPA and MHET
concentrations in the samples were estimated using standard curves (Supplementary Figs.
11a,11bshowstheTPAandMHETstandardcurvesfromone batch).
Enzymatic assay
The sortedmutantsunderwenttwoadditional roundsofassayscreening.The firstround wasa
supernatant assay. After overnight culturing in LB medium, cells were cultured in OnEx
System 2 medium supplemented with 100 μg/mL ampicillin and 0.2 g/L PET nanoparticles at
30°C and 700 rpm for 48 hours, with all samples in triplicate. Following cultivation, the cells
werecentrifuged,andthesupernatantwassubjected toHPLCanalysis
The second round involved a purified enzyme assay. Variants that showed enhanced activity
compared to the original IsPETase in the supernatant assay were further purified and
quantified usingthepreviouslydescribedproteinpurification methods.For thesecondroundof

screening, 40 nM of purified enzymes were thoroughly mixed with 4 g/L PETnanoparticlesin
100 mM KH2PO4-NaOH buffer (pH 8) and incubated at 30°C with shaking at 700 rpm for 48
hours.Thetotal assayvolumewas600μLina1.5mL Eppendorftube.
For additional enzymatic assays, 200 nM enzymes were typically used in a 600 μL buffered
system in a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, with the tubes placed inathermomixer settothedesired
temperature and shaken vigorously at 700 rpm, unless otherwise specified. The buffers used
inthe assaysincluded100mMKH 2PO4-NaOH(pH8.0) and100mMglycine-NaOH(pH9.0).
For assaysconductedatdifferentpHlevels,bufferswerepreparedasfollows:pH6.0,6.5,7.0,
7.5, and 8.0 werepreparedwith100mMKH 2PO4 andNaOH,whilepH9.0,9.5,and10.0were
preparedwith100mMglycineandNaOH.
For the preparation of PET substrates, PET nanoparticles were washed 2-3 times with the
specified buffers and then suspended to achieve the desired concentrations. PET products
were punched into 6 mm-diameter discs, then washed sequentially with 1% SDS, 70%
ethanol,anddeionizedwater beforeuse.
Enzyme Kinetics
Around 1.5 mg PET disc (equivalent to a quarter of a6mmdiameter-sizedPETdiscfromthe
postconsumer yoghourt container lid) was added into 125 μl reaction solution in PCR tubes.
The reaction solution consisted of 100 mM KH 2PO4・NaOH pH8 buffer and varying
concentrations of enzymes (5, 10, 25, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500 nM). The
PCR tubes were incubated in a Biorad PCR machine set at 50 °C for both the block and the
lid. Each enzyme concentration was tested in triplicate. A3μLsampleofthereactionsolution
was taken at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7 hours for measurement at 260 nm using aNanoDrop,followed
by a UV light absorbance method. If necessary, samples weredilutedwith thereactionbuffer.
The values reported by the NanoDrop 1000 are based on a path length of 1 cm. Standard
curves for TPA and MHET were also generated (Supplementary Figs. 11c, 11d), and a
weighted mean coefficient of 965 M–1 cm–1, corresponding to a combination of 30% TPA and
70% MHET, was used. Reaction velocities atdifferentenzymeconcentrationswerecalculated
by linear fitting. Inverse MM kinetics of Fast_2.9, FastPETase and LCCICCG data was fitted

Polyester textile pretreatment and degradation by Fast_2.9
Approximately 200 g of each of the three types of polyester textiles (the outer skirt of a pink
dress, the inner skirt of a pink dress, and a yellow T-shirt) were extruded using a capillary
rheometry set at 280 °C, and immediately quenched in ice-cold water. The extruded material
wasthengroundintopowder bya cryomil.
Approximately 7-8 mg (~12 g/L) pretreated polyester textile material was added into 100 mM
KH2PO4 ・NaOH (pH 8.0) buffer with 100 nM(0.24 mgenzyme・gPET

At the end of the 72 hours, the residual textiles were weighed usinglyophilizationtomeasure
weight loss. The overall weight loss after degradation was also calculated by comparing it to
theinitialmaterialweight.
Structuralanalysisandmoleculardynamicsmodelling
The starting coordinates for the IsPETase simulationswereobtainedfromthecrystalstructure
withPDBcode6EQE53 andforFastPETasefromthecrystalstructurewithPDBcode7SH618.
The PDB files were pre-processed with the dock-prep tool of Chimera (v1.16)89, to complete
incomplete side chains (using the Dunbrack 2010 library) and remove the low occupancy
alternative locations of side chains when present. Residue S269 was mutated with the
mutate_model.py script of MODELLER (v10.4)90 to T269. For the wild type, S269 was
maintainedasS269.
System parameterization was performed using the CHARMM-GUI web interface 91,92.
Hydrogens were assigned based on physiological pH, and the systems were placed on a
rectangular water box of TIP3P 93 water molecules extending at least 10 Å from any protein

atom. The solvated systems were neutralised using Cl- ions and an additional 150mM NaCl
wereadded.TheCHARMM36mforcefieldwasusedtoparametrizetheprotein 94.
The systems were first minimised for a maximum of 5000 steps, using the steepest descent
algorithm for the first 2500 steps and then switching to the conjugate gradient method. Weak
positional restraints of 1 kcal mol-1 angstrom-2 were added to all the protein atoms. Following
minimization, the systems wereequilibratedunder NVTensemblefor 125ps,duringwhich the
temperature wasraisedto303.15Kfor theIsPETasesimulationsand313Kfor theFastPETase
ones. Positional restraints were maintained during equilibration, with an integration time step
of1fs.
All productionsimulationswereconductedunder theisothermal,isobaricconditions(NPT) with
1 bar pressure, using the Langevin Thermostat95 (friction coefficient 1 ps-1) and Montecarlo
Barostat 96. Periodic boundary conditionsandParticleMeshEwald(real spacecutoff12Åand
grid spacing 1.2Å) wereemployedfor remoteelectrostaticinteractions 97,whileVander Waals
contacts were truncated at the real space cutoff. Protein bonds involving hydrogens were
constrained using the SHAKE algorithm, and water molecules were treated with SETTLE,
allowingfor anintegrationtimestepof2fs.
Simulations were runusingthesingleprecisionpmemd.cudaimplementationofAmber 2022 98.
Each system was simulated for a total of 1 µs, with simulation coordinates saved periodically
for further analysis.Theinitial 500nswerediscardedastheequilibration phase.
Root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) profiles for eachsystemwere obtained usingcpptraj98.
Trajectory frames were aligned using the backbone atoms (C, CA, N), and residue weighted
RMFS profiles were generated using atomic masses as weights. To compare systems, the
area under the curve (AUC) of the RMSF profile from residues 88 to 91 was calculated, and
significancewasassessedusingatwo-tailedindependentt-test.
Root mean square deviations (RMSD) profiles for residues88to91,whichshowedsignificant
fluctuations between the S269 and S269T variants, was computed using the mdtraj python
package 99. Frames were aligned to the crystal structure using the backbone atoms and
excluding the region of residues of interest. The RMSD was computed for C-α atoms from
residues 88 to 91 without realigning the trajectory to better capture different conformations.
Results from the differentreplicateswerecombined,andtheprobabilitydensitywascomputed
with scipy using the default number estimation of bins. Representative structures for each of
the RMSD peaks of the residues 88 to 91 were determined by randomly sampling 50
snapshots, computing an averagestructure,aligning itto thedockingstructure,andvisualising
itinPyMOL(http://www.pymol.org/pymol ).
Correlation paths were computed using WISP55 by combining all the replicates ofIsPETase
S269T. Paths were calculated using residue T269 as the source residue and residues T88 to
S93 as the sink, extending until reaching residue T88. Simulations were converted to PDB
format and saved 10 times less frequently. The top 10 shortest paths were computed using
default WISP parameters and visualised in PyMOL, with path thickness representing the
frequencyofoccurrence..
