The tightly regulated central carbon metabolism inSaccharomyces cerevisiae,
intricately linked to carbon sources utilized, poses a signiﬁcant challenge to
engineering efforts aimed at increasing theﬂux through its different pathways.
Here, we present a modular deregulation strategy that enables high conver-
sion rates of xylose through the central carbon metabolism. Speciﬁcally,
employing a multifacetedapproach encompassingﬁve different engineering
strategies— promoter engineering, transcription factor manipulation, bio-
sensor construction, introduction of heterologous enzymes, and expression of
mutant enzymes we engineer differentmodules of the central carbon meta-
bolism at both the genetic and enzymatic levels. This leads to an enhanced
conversion rate of xylose into acetyl-CoA-derived products, with
3-hydroxypropionic acid (3– HP) serving as a representative case in this study.
By implementing a combination of these approaches, the developed yeast
strain demonstrates a remarkable enhancement in 3– HP productivity,
achieving a 4.7– fold increase when comparedto our initially optimized 3– HP
producing strain grown on xylose as carbon source. These results illustrate
that the rational engineering of yeast central metabolism is a viable approach
for boosting the metabolicﬂux towards acetyl– CoA– derived products on a
non-glucose carbon source.
Enabling sustainable production of chemicals is the primary motiva-
tion for establishing bio-based production of fuels and chemicals. For
instance, the exploitation of renewable plant-based raw materials, such
as lignocellulose, for chemical production offers a more sustainable
alternative to many traditional chemical processes that depend heavily
on fossil fuels
1– 5. Since xylose ranks as the second most abundant sugar
in lignocellulosic feedstock, its effective use is crucial in ensuring the
economic feasibility of fermentation processes using lignocellulosic
based feedstocks
6,7.
Another signiﬁcant beneﬁt of bio-based production of fuels and
chemicals is the ability to synthesize a diverse range of biochemical
molecules using a single, well-developed‘platform cell factory’. Sac-
charomyces cerevisiae, an eukaryal model microorganism and a widely
used cell factory, is particularly valued due to its robustness under
harsh industrial conditions and its wide use in the fermentation
industry
8,9. Recently, engineered yeast strains have successfully pro-
duced a wide array of chemically diverse molecules 10– 12.T h e s e
achievements predominantly hinge on the utilization of several key
metabolites in the central carbon metabolism, such as pyruvate, citric
acid, α-ketoglutaric acid, and acetyl-CoA
13. Among these, acetyl-CoA
receives particular attention because it acts as a highly productive
node for generating numerous biochemical products, such as

CoA in yeast forms a pivotal foundation for sustainable and economic
feasible manufacturing of a broad range of bioproducts from lig-
nocellulosic biomass. To achieve this, it is essential to optimize theﬂux
through the different pathways of the central carbon metabolism.
However, enhancing theﬂux within the central carbon metabolism
presents inherent challenges due to its tightly regulated nature. These
stringent regulatory mechanisms are designed to support cell growth
and maintain homeostasis on the cells’ favorite carbon sources,
thereby potentially resisting any engineering attempts to alter this
balance on the unrecognized carbon sources

synthesizing acetyl-CoA-derived products from xylose or glucose-
xylose as carbon sources focused heavily on optimizing xylose utili-
zation and product conversion pathways to enhance the efﬁciency of
product formation. However, it often overlooked how cells reconﬁ-
gure their metabolism, including central metabolic pathways, in
response to xylose utilization
7,14. As a result, our understanding of the
intracellular regulation of the central carbon metabolism during xylose
utilization remains limited, which further complicates the task of
rational engineering or deregulating the central carbon metabolism to
ensure high conversion rate of xylose.
In this study, we initially constructed and optimized a
conversion module in yeast (Fig. 1a) that converts acetyl-CoA to
3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP), with the objective of directing carbon
ﬂux from xylose to acetyl-CoA and further to 3-HP. Subsequently, we
divided the central carbon metabolism into three distinct modules for
systematic deregulaitng the central metabolic pathways during xylose
utilization (Fig.1a). To navigate the regulatory aspects of central car-
bon metabolism, either at the transcriptional or enzymatic levels
across different modules, we employedﬁve distinct engineering stra-
tegies: (1) evaluating the potency of a collection of promoters in rela-
tion to xylose utilization and subsequently utilizing them for gene
expression control; (2) modulating the expression of enriched tran-
scription factors (TFs) via upregulation or downregulation; (3) intro-
ducing heterologous proteins as replacements for the extensively
modiﬁed endogenous counterparts; (4) substituting the modiﬁed
amino acid sites on the proteins; (5) constructing biosensors to
monitor and sense intracellular metabolites levels such as NADPH and
fatty acyl-CoA (Fig. 1b). By applying these strategies, our results
demonstrate that despite the existence of stringent regulatory sys-
tems, it is indeed possible to manipulate the central metabolism
pathway to increaseﬂux towards desired products.

referred to as the 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) production module. The central

each module in the central carbon metabolism,ﬁve engineering strategies were
employed: (1) controlling gene expression at the transcriptional level by a series of
promoters characterized on xylose; (2) manipulating global transcription factors
(TFs); (3) introducing heterologous proteins; (4) expressing mutated proteins; and
(5) constructing biosensors.b The detailed implementations of the above

Results
Characterizing various promoters in relation to xylose
utilization
Given the crucial role of promoters in bypassing inherent regulation and
driving gene expression in a desired manner, weﬁrst evaluated how a
broad spectrum of promoters are controlled during xylose utilization.
To achieve this, we performed an RNA-seq analysis, considering that
transcript proﬁling can provide an effective method for assessing the
cell’s transcriptional response to varied carbon utilization. For this
analysis, we constructed strain X266, which was transformed with a
plasmid containing xylose isomerase (XI) and xylitol kinase (XK), for the
conversion of xylose to xylulose, along with our previously identiﬁed
modiﬁcations that ensured an efﬁcient xylose assimilation
14 (Supple-
mentary Data 1). Strain X266 was then cultured in xylose minimal
medium, using a glucose medium as a comparison. Based on the varied
gene transcriptional levels on xylose and glucose, we selected a list of
promoters for evaluation, which included several that have been pre-
viously characterized and are widely used on glucose
15–17 (Supplemen-
tary Data 3). In total, we evaluated the expression of 40 different
promoters during growth on either xylose or glucose, utilizing red
ﬂuorescent protein (RFP) as a reporter (Supplementary Fig. 1a).
Reﬂecting on the diverse RFP expression behaviors supervised by
these promoters in response to xylose and glucose utilization, we
categorized and deﬁned them into three distinct groups: (1) xylose-
responsive promoters, which demonstratedﬁve times greater strength
on xylose compared to glucose; (2) glucose-responsive promoters,
which exhibited a reverse expression pattern relative to xylose-
responsive promoters; and (3) constitutive promoters, whose expres-
sion levels showed minimal variation in gene expression during growth
on xylose and glucose (Supplementary Fig. 1b–d). The strong correlation
between RNA-seq data andﬂuorescence intensity conﬁrms that these
promoters efﬁciently regulate protein expression in a manner that
responds to different carbon source utilization (Supplementary Fig. 1
and Supplementary Data 3). This behavior is notably different from
previously characterized promoters, which were primarily derived from
central metabolic pathways
18. Next, to create a more comprehensive set
of xylose-responsive promoters with a wide range of intensities, we
screened an extra 13 promoters based on transcriptome data (Supple-
mentary Data 3). We assessed the strength of each promoter by inte-
grating them into the genome, utilizing greenﬂuorescent protein (GFP)
as a reporter due to its superiorﬂuorescence intensity, thereby pro-
viding more suitable evaluation of weaker promoters
19. By culturing the
constructed strains in xylose minimal medium, we observed that the
measured promoters spanned a 42-fold range of GFPﬂuorescence
intensities, while these promoters exhibited relatively lowﬂuorescence
intensities in glucose minimal medium (Fig.2a).
Natural systems tend to favor regulons, or nutrient-responsive
gene regulations that manage numerous cellular functions, such as
nutrient-assimilation pathways, which are critical for cell survival and
growth. For example, previous research has shown that regulon-
controlled expression of galactose catabolic genes supports higher
growth rates compared to their constitutive expression
20.T oe x p l o r e
whether employing xylose-responsive promoters for controlling the
expression of catabolic genes could likewise boost xylose utilization
efﬁciency, we substituted the promoters of XI, a pivotal step in con-
trolling xylose assimilation
14,w i t hpADH2 and pSFC1, two xylose-
responsive promoters with strong and moderate strength, respec-
tively. Upon assessing cell growth, we found thatpADH2-controlled XI
resulted in faster cellular growth compared to the use of the con-
stitutive promoterpTEF1, thereby demonstrating the advantage of
using xylose-responsive promoters (Fig.2b).
Optimizing the 3-HP bioconversion module
Next, to reﬂect the strength of the metabolicﬂux from xylose through
central carbon metabolism to acetyl-CoA, it is crucial to channel this
intermediate towards a designated product. While the choice of such a
product must (1) circumvent the introduction of highly regulated
metabolic pathways, such as fatty acid or terpene biosynthesis, and (2)
avoid the requirement for several intermediate metabolites, such as
ﬂavonoid synthesis (Supplementary Fig. 2). We therefore introduced a
conversion module (Module I) to produce 3-HP (Fig.1a), that was
chosen due to its straightforward synthetic pathway from acetyl-CoA/
malonyl-CoA.
In Module I, we reconstructed a 3-HP biosynthesis pathway by
introducing the bifunctional enzyme MCR fromChloroﬂexus aur-
antiacus, which catalyzes the conversion of malonyl-CoA to 3-HP in
two steps
21,22, using malonate semialdehyde as an intermediate (Sup-
plementary Fig. 3a). The incorporation of MCR in a plasmid resulted in
the production of 74 mg/L of 3-HP from 20 g/L of xylose (Supple-
mentary Fig. 3b). Next, to optimize Module I, we utilized glucose as the
carbon source. This simpliﬁed the genetic manipulation steps by
eliminating the need to consider xylose metabolism and also provided
an opportunity to compare the performance of these two carbon
sources. Previous research has indicated that splitting MCR into McrN
and McrC components could improve enzyme activity, while a muta-
ted form of McrC (McrCm) further boosted 3-HP production in
Escherichia coli
23. Applying these approaches, we observed consistent
outcomes across the engineered yeast strains, resulting in a 3-HP level
of up to 1.2 g/L (Supplementary Fig. 3c). However, this splitting strat-
egy challenges the commonly observed beneﬁt of protein fusion
strategy to facilitate substrate trafﬁcking
24,25. To investigate this
anomaly, we aggregated McrN and McrCm into three different fusion
forms, including the wild-type form (McrN-Cm) and two linker-based
fusions (McrN-linker-McrCm and McrCm-linker-McrN). However, none
of these constructions increased 3-HP production, suggesting that
physical proximity does not necessarily facilitate substrate trafﬁcking
between these two catalytic components (Supplementary Fig. 3c).
Moving forward, to create a stable conversion module capable of
incorporating generated acetyl-CoA, we integrated the McrN-Cm gene
into the chromosome XI-3 locus. Unexpectedly, reducing the copy
number of McrN-Cm led to a signiﬁcant decrease in the yield of 3-HP,
falling to 116 mg/L from 20 g/L of glucose. Subsequently, weﬁne-tuned
the ratio of these two components by controlling McrN with 5 different
promoters of varying strengths. This strategy successfully increased
the yield of 3-HP to 2.1 g/L when McrN was regulated by thepENO2
promoter and McrCm was controlled by thepHXT7 promoter (Sup-
plementary Fig. 4), which emphasized the balance between these two
catalyzing components.
When the xylose metabolic pathway was introduced into the best
producing strain on glucose, there was a dramatic decrease in 3-HP
production in xylose medium (Fig.2c). Interestingly, when we sub-
stituted the McrN promoter with pTEF1, we observed a 1.2-fold
increase in 3-HP levels, a pattern distinct from that observed on glu-
cose (Fig.2c and Supplementary Fig. 4). Next, given the demonstrated
beneﬁts of the xylose-responsive promoter in enhancing xylose utili-
zation (Fig.2b), we replaced the promoter of McrN withpALD4 (strain
R30c), resulting in a 92% improvement in 3-HP levels compared to
those achieved with the McrN promoter usingpTEF1(Fig.2c). With this
optimized 3-HP converting module on xylose, we proceeded to
improve the metabolicﬂux through the central carbon pathway from
xylose.
Engineering global TFs to enhance the metabolicﬂux through
central carbon metabolism
Control over theﬂux through central carbon metabolism requires
amplifying the activities of numerous enzymes within this pathway to
a c h i e v ea ni n c r e a s ei nﬂux. A potential strategy to bypass this issue
could involve the engineering of regulatory networks that govern
central carbon metabolism. It is important to note that the cell’sc e n -
tral carbon metabolism varies across different carbon sources through

metabolic ﬂux that transforms xylose into acetyl-CoA through glyco-
lysis and the pyruvate branching pathway is close to the yeast’sf e r -
mentation metabolism on glucose (Supplementary Fig. 2). Therefore,
to increase the metabolicﬂux from xylose to acetyl coenzyme A, we
propose engineering TFs to simulate the metabolic state of
central carbon metabolism typically observed when glucose is the
carbon source.
To identify TFs that govern glucose metabolism, we undertook a
differential TF analysis. During this analysis, we considered two sets of
input data: (1) the entire genomic catalog of yeast genes, and (2) a subset
of genes crucially linked to central metabolism (Fig.3a). This subset
included genes related to glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, the tricarboxylic
acid (TCA) cycle, the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), oxidative
phosphorylation, respiration metabolism, pyruvate metabolism, the
glyoxylate cycle, as well as carbon transport and metabolism. By
integrating the transcriptional differences of genes under glucose and
xylose conditions, along with their regulatory network interactions with
transcription factors, we scored 150 and 125 TFs, respectively (Supple-
mentary Data 6 and 7). The top 10 TFs that were signiﬁcantly up-
regulated and the top 10 TFs that were signiﬁcantly down-regulated are
presented in Fig.3b. Interestingly, half of the enriched TFs were shared
for both inputs, implying that the regulatory shifts in yeast cells on
glucose and xylose mainly involve central carbon metabolism. Next, we
checked the changes in these TFs’ expression levels on glucose and

levels aligned with the up- and down-regulation patterns identiﬁed from
our reporter TF analysis for overexpression or deletion (Fig.3b). Ulti-
mately, we tested 18 TFs and found that overexpressingMBP1, GCR1,a n d
GCR2 enhanced theﬂux towards 3-HP production from 11% to 22%
compared to the control strain (Fig.3c). Meanwhile, deletingSIP4 and
Mig1 increased theﬂux through the central pathway by 9% and 11%,
respectively (Fig.3d). Notably, the removal of genes related to the HAP
complex, a signiﬁcant regulator of respiratory gene expression, severely
reduced theﬂux towards 3-HP production as well as cellular growth

(Fig. 3d and Supplementary Fig. 5b), suggesting the necessity for meti-
culous regulation of cellular respiration.
Further investigation revealed that the combined overexpression
of MBP1, GCR1,a n dGCR2 enhanced 3-HP production by 29% (Supple-
mentary Fig. 6). This moderate boost in 3-HP production suggests that
improving theﬂux through engineering of a set of TFs is a challenging
task. Given glucose’ss i g n iﬁcant advantage over xylose in synthesizing
acetyl-CoA through central metabolism, this beneﬁti sf u n d a m e n t a l l y
attributed to two crucial regulatory mechanisms present under glu-
cose conditions: the carbon catabolite repression (CCR) effect
30 and
the Crabtree effect31. These mechanisms, which are less pronounced
under xylose conditions, primarily involve glycolysis, mitochondrial
metabolism, and pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) bypass. Conse-
quently, we have divided the metabolic pathway from xylose to acetyl-
CoA into three distinct modules: the glycolysis module, the mito-
chondrial module, and the PDH bypass module (Fig.1a). Our next step
was to systematically deregulate each module, thereby promoting
metabolic ﬂux through the central pathway and directing theﬂux
toward 3-HP production.
Deregulation of glycolysis module
Previous studies demonstrated that, in contrast to glucose, xylose
does not fully activate the CCR response inS. cerevisiae,r e s u l t i n gi n
diminished carbonﬂux through the glycolytic pathway
29,32. However,
optimizing the glycolytic pathway poses a formidable challenge, as it
represents one of the most complex and tightly regulated routes
within the central metabolic pathways
33. To mitigate this regulatory
structure and increase theﬂux through glycolysis, we executed the
following major modiﬁcations: (1) blocking gluconeogenesis and the
glyoxylate cycle, (2) increasing the expression levels of glycolytic
enzymes, (3) integrating glycolytic enzymes from E. coli, (4) expressing
key mutated enzymes in glycolysis, and (5) engineering effector and
cofactor metabolism.
Considering the differential CCR response on glucose and
xylose, weﬁrst analyzed the transcriptional levels of central carbon
metabolism-related genes under both conditions (Supplementary
Fig. 7). Our results indicated that when xylose was the carbon
source, genes involved in glycolysis were downregulated, while
those involved in gluconeogenesis and the glyoxylate cycle were
upregulated, compared to their expression on glucose. Addition-
ally, we examined the transcriptional levels when using ethanol, a
fully gluconeogenic carbon source requiring ﬂux through the
reverse glycolytic direction. We found that, compared to their
expression on ethanol, the genes involved in glycolysis were upre-
gulated, and those involved in gluconeogenesis and the glyoxylate
cycle were downregulated. Theseﬁndings suggest that when cells
grow on xylose, enzymes from both the gluconeogenic and glyco-
lytic pathways are active and operate in opposite directions,

potentially leading to futile cycling (Fig.4a). To validate this, we
proceeded to delete 6 genes involved in the gluconeogenesis
pathway and the glyoxylate cycle (Fig.4a). The deletion ofPCK1 and
FBP1, which are involved in the gluconeogenesis pathway, led to a
signiﬁcant increase in 3-HP production ( P < 0.05). In contrast,
deleting MLS1 and CIT2, which are associated with the glyoxylate
cycle, resulted in a decrease in 3-HP production (Fig. 4b). This
suggests that while the gluconeogenesis pathway contributed
somewhat to futile cycling, the glyoxylate cycle did not.
Next, to identify the pivotal steps that signiﬁcantly inﬂuence gly-
colytic ﬂux, we initially assessed the expression levels of glycolytic
enzymes. As illustrated in Fig. 4a, we divided the linear glycoly-
tic pathway into two segments: ‘upstream glycolysis’,w h i c h
spans from fructose-6-phosphate to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate, and
Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59966-x

‘downstream glycolysis’, which extends from glyceraldehyde-3-
phosphate to pyruvate. We then evaluated the impact of each step
on regulating metabolicﬂux through glycolysis by overexpressing the
corresponding gene for each step in the pathway. The overexpression
of these genes resulted in a modest enhancement of 3-HP yield, with
the most signiﬁcant improvement being a 13% increase observed by
the overexpression ofPYK1 (Fig. 4c). Additionally, the combinational
overexpression of 4 genes (PFK1, PFK2, FBA1,a n dTPI1)f r o m‘upstream
glycolysis’ resulted in a 27% improvement in 3-HP production, while
the simultaneous overexpression ofﬁve genes (TDH3, PGK1, GMP1,
ENO2,a n dPYK1)f r o m‘downstream glycolysis’ led to a 19% increase.
Interestingly, the co-overexpression of all nine genes surprisingly
resulted in a decrease in 3-HP synthesis compared with overexpressing
either the upper or lower glycolytic enzymes alone, indicating that a
balanced interplay between the upstream and downstream glycolysis
is crucial (Fig.4c).
Previous research has shown that in yeast, thermodynamically
favored enzymes, such as phosphofructokinase (Pfk1 and Pfk2), fruc-
tose bisphosphatase (Fba1), phosphoglycerate mutase (Gpm1), and
pyruvate kinase (Pyk1), undergo extensive post-translational mod-
iﬁcations in yeast
34.T h e s em o d iﬁcations play an important role in
modulating their enzymatic activities and, consequently, the glycolytic
ﬂux. To circumnavigate the complications arising from the regulation
of endogenous enzymes, we opted to introduce enzymes fromE. coli
into yeast. The introduction offbaA, gpmA,a n dpykA enhanced 3-HP
production by 12%, 10%, and 19%, respectively. In contrast, the
expression ofpfkA resulted in a 25% reduction in 3-HP production,
demonstrating a different regulation pattern of PFK in yeast (Supple-
mentary Fig. 8).
An alternative approach to avoid endogenous enzyme modiﬁca-
tions is to express enzymes with mutated regulation sites. To further
explore the key regulatory steps within glycolysis, we focused on
investigating the effects of modiﬁcations on these four enzymes.
Among them, Pfk1 and Pyk1 are subject to allosteric regulation, while
Fba1 and Gpm1 undergo phosphorylation modiﬁcations (Fig.4d)
34– 37.A
previous study demonstrated that a mutation in the enzyme Pfk1
(P728L) renders the enzyme capable of allosteric activation without
requiring AMP or 2,6-bisphosphofructose37. The introduction of the
P728L mutation into Pfk1 and/or its potential regulatory counterpart
Pfk2 (P722L) (Supplementary Fig. 9) led to a decrease in 3-HP pro-
duction compared to their respective wild-type versions (Fig.4c, e).
This unexpected result prompted us to hypothesize that the mutant
site might have caused a disparity in the activities of the Pfk1 and Pfk2
subunits, thereby reducing the activity of the resulting heterotetramer.
To test this hypothesis, we experimented with both promoter sub-
stitutions and mutation introductions. This approach resulted in 3-HP
production varying from 0.9 g/L to 2.1 g/L, a 2.2-fold disparity (Fig.4e),
indicating that the PFK step serves as a crucial control point within the
glycolytic pathway. Similarly, we overexpressed a mutated version of
Pyk1 (E392A), which eliminated the cooperativity and allosteric
regulation
36, resulting in a 19% enhancement of 3-HP production
(Fig. 4f). To further investigate whether the expression level of the
mutant Pyk1 has an impact on glycolyticﬂux, we changed its promoter
from pPCK1 to pTPI1. This switch did not obviously alter 3-HP pro-
duction (Fig.4f and Supplementary Fig. 10), demonstrating that, unlike
PFK, PYK is not a major regulatory point. In addition to allosteric
regulation, phosphorylation modiﬁcation serves as another vital and
rapid form of metabolic regulation. Within the glycolytic pathway,
Fba1 and Gpm1 are two enzymes that undergo a high degree of
phosphorylation
34,b e i n gm o d iﬁed at a singular locus. To explore
whether negating the phosphorylation modiﬁcation through point
mutations on these two enzymes would substantially inﬂuence gly-
colytic ﬂux, we proceeded to overexpress their mutated variants.
Speciﬁcally, we substituted the modiﬁed serine residue with either
aspartic acid or glutamic acid, consequently creating Fba1m1 (S313D),
Fba1m2 (S313E), Gpm1m1 (S116D), and Gpm1m2 (S116E) (Fig.4d). The
two Fba1 mutant variants demonstrated comparable 3-HP synthesis
yields to those observed when overexpressing the wild-type Fba1.
Conversely, the two Gpm1 mutant variants resulted in a higher yield of
3-HP compared to overexpressing the wild-type Gpm1, with
Gpm1m2 showing a 17% increase in yield relative to the wild type
(Fig. 4c, f). These results suggest that phosphorylation acts as a
negative regulator of Gpm1 in controlling its activity.
Beyond manipulating enzymes directly involved in glycolytic
pathway, we also examined the impact of effectors, such as fructose-
2,6-bisphosphate, and cofactors, including ATP and NADPH, on 3-HP
synthesis. As fructose-2,6-bisphosphate is a powerful positive allos-
teric effector that activates glycolysis
38, we overexpressed the key gene
PFK27 using a range of promoters with varying strengths, aiming to
increase its levels while avoiding excessive amounts that could cause
carbon loss. The results showed that, under the control of promoter
pARO9, the production of 3-HP improved by 15% (Supplementary
Fig. 11). Given that a reduction in intracellular ATP levels can boost
glycolytic ﬂux, we opted to add benzoate, a non-metabolizable weak
acid whose transport can result in decreased cellular ATP levels
(Supplementary Fig. 11a), to the xylose medium
39.W h i l et h eo v e r a l l
level of 3-HP did not increase with the addition of benzoic acid, the
amount per unit of OD
600 biomass was signiﬁcantly elevated (Sup-
plementary Fig. 11b, c), suggesting a potential increase inﬂux through
the glycolytic enzymes. This was further evidenced by the production
of 0.8 g/L acetate when 16 mM benzoic acid was added (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 11d). NADH levels are another crucial factor inﬂuencing gly-
colytic ﬂux
40. However, since NADPH plays a signiﬁcant role in the
synthesis of 3-HP, we aimed to strike a balance between reducing
NADH levels while simultaneously increasing NADPH levels to opti-
mize the production of 3-HP. This was achieved by introducing a
NADP
+-dependent glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GapN)41, which was regulated using either thepTEF1 and pACH1 pro-
moters or a constructed biosensor promoter designed to activate
GapN expression when NADPH levels are low
42. Interestingly, utilizing
the pTEF1 promoter to control GapN expression resulted in a max-
imum increase of 3-HP synthesis, with a 52% improvement compared
to the control R30c (Fig.4g). Additionally, substituting the native
promoter of Tdh3, an enzyme responsible for generating intracellular
NADH, with the glucose-responsive promoterpHXT1,f u r t h e ri n c r e a s e d
the production of 3-HP by 13% (Fig.4g).

Engineering pyruvate transporters to control carbonﬂux
entering mitochondria
A notable characteristic ofS. cerevisiae metabolism under aerobic
conditions with an excess of glucose is the Crabtree effect, which
diverts the carbonﬂux of pyruvate towards ethanol production31.T h i s
effect is often associated with low respiratory efﬁciency, a phenom-
enon attributed to glucose inhibition. When xylose was used as a car-
bon source, genes associated with ethanol synthesis were signiﬁcantly
downregulated, while those for ethanol consumption were upregu-
lated, in comparison with glucose (Supplementary Fig. 13). Addition-
ally, genes related to the TCA cycle and respiration were upregulated
(Supplementary Fig. 14). These observations suggest that xylose does
not exhibit a signiﬁcant Crabtree effect. Instead, the increased activity
of the TCA cycle and respiratory metabolism leads to carbon loss.
Thus, to minimize the diversion of carbon into the mitochondria and
instead direct the ﬂux toward acetyl-CoA synthesis, we aimed to
engineer the pyruvate transporter, a crucial gatekeeper for
mitochondrial entry.
In S. cerevisiae, the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (Mpc) facil-
itates the transport of cytoplasmic pyruvate into the mitochondria and
is encoded by three genes:MPC1, MPC2,a n dMPC3
43. These genes form
two distinct transportation complexes: Mpc1-Mpc2 and Mpc1-Mpc3,
referred to as MPC
FERM and MPCOX, respectively, with the latter exhi-
biting greater transport activity44. Concurrently, yeast cells selectively
express these two complexes based on nutrient availability. Therefore,
we ﬁrst investigated the expression levels of these three genes in the
presence of xylose. We observed a substantial decrease inMPC2
transcripts and a signiﬁcant increase inMPC3 transcripts compared to
glucose (Fig.5a and Supplementary Fig. 13). Conversely, the transcript
levels ofMPC2 and MPC3 showed opposite trends when compared to
ethanol (Supplementary Fig. 13). To determine the impact ofMPC2 on
pyruvate transport, we employed a glucose-responsive promoter to
regulate its expression but found no notable difference in 3-HP levels,
indicating thatMPC2doesn’t play a pivotal role in this process (Fig.5b).
Subsequently, weﬁne-tuned the expression ofMPC3 by utilizing a
series of xylose-responsive promoters with relatively weaker strength
compared topMPC3 (Fig. 2a), aiming to regulate mitochondrial pyr-
uvate import. By employing the promoterpARO9to regulateMPC3,w e
successfully channeled more carbonﬂux towards acetyl-CoA forma-
tion, resulting in a 29% enhancement of 3-HP production relative to the
parental strain R30c (Fig.5b).
Redirecting carbonﬂux toward PDH bypass pathway
Considering attenuation of the Crabtree effect during xylose meta-
bolism, the conversion of pyruvate into acetyl-CoA may be less efﬁ-
cient. In fact, the PDH bypass pathway is tightly regulated in yeast,
thereby resulting in a controlledﬂux through this crucial metabolic
route
45. To tackle this issue, we employed various engineering strate-
gies, including the overexpression or mutation of the regulated
enzymes, introduction of exogenous pathways, and construction of
new regulatable systems by introducing biosensors. These approaches
were designed to (1) redirect theﬂux towards acetyl-CoA formation,
(2) further drive theﬂux towards malonyl-CoA formation, and (3)
autoregulate fatty acid accumulation.
In yeast, pyruvate is converted to acetyl-CoA in cytosol by three
enzymes: pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC), aldehyde dehydrogenase
(ALD), and acetyl-CoA synthetase (ACS) (Fig.5c). Among them, only
the transcription level ofPDC1 was relatively low when xylose was used
as a carbon source, compared to glucose (Supplementary Fig. 13).
Therefore, we overexpressed thePDC1 gene under the control of
promoters pCIT2 and pMDH2. The results indicated that using the
pCIT2promoter led to a slight improvement in 3-HP production, with a
9% increase compared to the parental strain R30c (Fig.5d), suggesting
that PDC is not a main limiting step during this conversion. Further-
more, given that ACS is strictly regulated in yeast through acetylation,
we introduced a variant of ACS (L641P) from Salmonella enterica to
avoid regulatory inhibition by acetylation
46. However, unexpectedly,
overexpressing ACS (L641P) using thepCCW12 promoter led to a
reduction in 3-HP synthesis, highlighting the unpredictability of ACS in
controlling acetyl-CoA production (Fig.5d ) .T oa d d r e s st h i si s s u e ,w e
introduced the enzyme EutE fromE. coli, which can directly convert
acetaldehyde to acetyl-CoA47, resulting in a 40% improvement in 3-HP
production compared to strain R30c. Next, to circumvent the native
regulatory mechanisms of the complete PDH bypass pathway, we
introduced pyruvate oxidase (PO) from Aerococcus viridans and
phosphotransacetylase (PTA) fromSalmonella entericato enable the
direct conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA
48, utilizing acetyl phos-

verted to acetate by the native glycerol-3-phosphate phosphatase
(Gpp1)
47,w es u b s e q u e n t l yd e l e t e dt h eG P P 1g e n ei nt h ep a r e n t a ls t r a i n
R30c, creating strain R70. Unexpectedly, the expression of PO and PTA
in R70 resulted in a sharp decrease in 3-HP production and a reduced
biomass formation (Fig.5e and Supplementary Fig. 15c). We speculated
that the generation of H
2O2 during the catalysis process could be the
potential reason. However, the overexpression of either native or
exogenous catalases, which play a role in H
2O2 detoxiﬁcation, failed to
restore the biomass and 3-HP levels (Supplementary Fig. 15b, c). This
result led us to hypothesize that additional types of oxide molecules
might have been generated in addition to H
2O2. To investigate this
possibility, we overexpressed several other antioxidant genes 49,
namely AHP1, CCP1, YAP1, SOD1,a n dSOD2. Of the genes tested, the
simultaneous overexpression ofSOD1and SOD2, which are responsible
for detoxifying superoxide, restored biomass formation and resulted
in a notable enhancement of 3-HP production, with a 34% improve-
ment observed compared to strain R70 (Fig.5e and Supplementary
Fig. 15b, c).
The conversion of acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA is catalyzed by
acetyl-CoA carboxylase Acc1, the transcription of which is meticulously
regulated by TFs, and the activity of which is primarily controlled
through phosphorylation
50. Previous attempts to eliminate phos-
phorylation regulation by substituting two serine residues (S659 and
S1157) in Acc1 with alanine led to a substantial increase in fatty acid
production
51. To deregulate Acc1 and optimize its expression level
when grown on xylose, we expressed the modiﬁed Acc1 (S659A and
S1157A) using various xylose-responsive promoters. Our results
demonstrated that utilizing promoterpKGD1 resulted in the most
notable increase in 3-HP production, showing a 1.1-fold enhancement
compared to the parental strain R30c (Fig.5f). Although the point-
mutated Acc1 led to a vast improvement, there was a reported risk of
back mutations to its wild-type form. Consequently, we attempted an
alternative approach, in which the regulatory loop of Acc1, spanning
residues S1137 to S1170, was substituted with aﬂexible linker (GGGG)
to prevent phosphorylation modiﬁcations
52. This approach resulted in
an 88% elevation in 3-HP production compared to the R30c strain.
As a crucial connector between central carbon metabolism and
fatty acid synthesis, fatty acid synthase, comprised of Fas1 and Fas2, is
stringently regulated within yeast cells. Fas1 and Fas2 undergo co-
regulation at the transcriptional level by general transcription factors
including Reb1, Rap1, and Abf1, as well as the phospholipid-speciﬁc
heterodimeric activator Ino2/Ino4
53,54. Additionally, the expression of
Fas2 is positively autoregulated by the level of Fas155.T on a v i g a t et h e
native complex regulation and minimize the overﬂow of carbonﬂux
into fatty acid synthesis, we built a regulatable system that utilizes
biosensors to detect cellular levels of fatty acyl-CoA (Fig.5g). In this
biosensor system, we fused the Gal4 activation domain and the yeast
transcriptional mediator Med2 separately with FadR, which is
responsive to cellular acyl-CoA levels
56, thereby creating two synthetic
activators (Fig.5g). The expression of these activators was regulated by
either the promoterpTEF1 or UAS-pTDH3, aiming toﬁne-tune their
expression levels. Additionally, we inserted 1 or 3 binding sites (BSs) for
Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-59966-x

FadR into the upstream region of thepLEU2 and pGAL1 core pro-
moters. These modiﬁed promoters were subsequently utilized to
control the expression of Fas1. Through this design, the fused FadR
activator binds to the BSs in the modiﬁed promoters to activate Fas1
expression when acyl-CoA levels are low. Conversely, as the levels of
acyl-CoA increase, the activator dissociates from the promoter, deac-
tivating transcription and consequently downregulating Fas1
expression. Unexpectedly, integrating this biosensor system resulted
in lower 3-HP production (Fig.5h and Supplementary Fig. 16a), likely
due to the low levels of acyl-CoA accumulation. In response, we
knocked out thePXA1 gene, which is essential for importing acyl-CoA
into peroxisomes. This modiﬁcation signiﬁcantly increased 3-HP pro-
duction, with the most notable improvements observed when the
FadR-Med2 activator was expressed in conjunction with the modiﬁed

pGAL1 promoter containing three binding sites (Fig.5h and Supple-
mentary Fig. 16a). Notably, we observed a sharp increase in xylitol
levels in these engineered biosensor strains (Supplementary Fig. 16a,
e). Our previous research uncovered a connection between the
expression of Adh6 and fatty acid metabolism, with Adh6 playing a
pivotal role in xylitol formation. Thisﬁnding was further corroborated
by the increase in xylitol levels when we downregulated the expression
of Fas1 (Supplementary Fig. 16b, c). Following the deletion of Adh6
from the engineered biosensor strain, the xylitol level decreased, and
the 3-HP level reached 3.1 g/L, representing a 1.4-fold enhancement
compared to strain R30c (Fig.5h and Supplementary Fig. 16e).
Combination of the strategies to enhance theﬂux toward 3-HP
and ﬂaviolin formation
After investigating the deregulated steps within the central metabolic
pathway, we subsequently integrated these deregulation strategies
with the goal of channeling more carbonﬂux towards 3-HP production
(Fig. 6a). Initially, by deleting theFBP1 and PCK1 genes from the glu-
coneogenic pathway in strain R30c, we enhanced 3-HP production by
34% (Fig.6b). Following this, we overexpressed the mutated genes in
the glycolytic pathway, including PYK1m, GPM1m2,a n d FAB1m1,
resulting in strain RC04p, which exhibited an additional 31% increase in
3-HP production. Furthermore, the introduction ofgapN into RC04p
led to the creation of strain RC05p, which displayed a further 24%
improvement in 3-HP yield compared to strain RC04p. Interestingly,
while the overexpression of wild-typePFK1 together with mutated
PKF2m in RC05p decreased the 3-HP yield, the same combination in
RC04p led to an 8% increase in 3-HP yield compared to strain RC04p,
suggesting a potential link between PFK and cofactor metabolism.
Subsequently, we co-overexpressed three TFs, namelyGCR1, GCR2,
and MBP1, and observed a slight increase in 3-HP production. A similar
outcome was noted when we downregulatedMPC3 expression using
the pIDP2 promoter, indicating a potential limitation in the down-
stream pathway. To test this, we introduced an additional copy of
MCRN and MCRCm into strain RC05p, resulting in strain RC05Bp,
which exhibited a 29% increase in 3-HP production. Further down-
regulation ofMPC3 expression in RC05Bp generated strain RC10Bp,
which led to an additional 12% increase in 3-HP production. We then
introduced the PDH bypass pathway by individually or in combination
overexpressingPDC1, ACSm, eutE, tACC1,a n dACC1** in various strains,
such as RC05p, RC10p, and RC10Bp. The optimal result was achieved
when ACC1** was overexpressed in strain RC10Bp, resulting in a 3-HP
level of 6.05 g/L, which represents a 47% enhancement compared to
RC10Bp. Utilizing the promoterpARO9 to regulate the expression of
FAS1 in the RC10Bp strain led to an 11% increase in 3-HP levels. To
determine whether the overexpression of MCR could drive more car-
bon ﬂux from the central metabolic pathway to 3-HP production, we
inserted theMCRN and MCRCm genes into a plasmid and employed
different promoters to control their expression. Contrary to our
expectations, it was speciﬁcally the combination of using the promoter
pMDH2 for MCRN and the promoterpHXT7 for MCRCm that yielded a
signiﬁcant boost in 3-HP production, reaching a concentration of
7.46 g/L. To visualize the distribution of metabolicﬂux in the central
carbon metabolic pathway, we performed fermentation (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 18) and parsimoniousﬂux balance analysis (pFBA) (Supple-
mentary Fig. 19). The results revealed that a greater proportion of
ﬂux
was channeled from the central metabolic pathway towards 3-HP
synthesis, consistent with the design of our engineered strain for 3-HP
production.
To produce ﬂaviolin, which was repurposed as a malonyl-CoA
biosensor
57,w ed e l e t e dt h eMCR genes in strains R30C, RC05p,
RC10Bp, and RC32F2p8, and subsequently introducedrppA.T h i s
resulted in the creation of strains RE01p, RE04p, RE05p, and RE03p.
Among these, RE03p exhibited a signiﬁcant increase inﬂaviolin titer by
46% and a 137% higher yield per OD compared to RE01p (Supple-
mentary Fig. 21). In contrast, while RE04p and RE05p had a higher yield
per biomass, they produced lessﬂaviolin than R30C. Our modiﬁca-
tions not only enhanced the conversion efﬁciency of xylose to acetyl-
CoA but also increased the NADPH synthesisﬂux (Supplementary
Fig. 19). Importantly,ﬂaviolin synthesis requires acetyl-CoA but does
not necessitate NADPH. Consequently, higherﬂux of acetyl-CoA in the
engineered strain increasedﬂaviolin production, whereas the synthe-
sized NADPH adversely impacted its synthesis level. Therefore, the
current engineered strain is more suitable for producing acetyl-CoA-
derived products that also require NADPH as a cofactor.
Discussion
The development of yeast platform strains for acetyl-CoA-derived
products has garnered signiﬁcant attention due to the potential of
acetyl-CoA as a precursor for various biochemicals. Moreover, the
acetyl-CoA node serves as a bridge between cellular central metabo-
lism and bioproduct generation pathways. Over millions of years of
evolution, central carbon metabolism has evolved to prioritize bio-
mass production over the generation of desired products
1. Conse-
quently, deregulating intracellular central metabolism is a crucial
prerequisite to maximize carbonﬂux toward theﬁnal product.
To achieve the desired cellular phenotype, it is often necessary to
control the expression of multiple genes, typically through the reg-
ulation of TFs. However, unlikeE. coli, which has a hierarchical TF
network that simpliﬁes the process of redirecting carbonﬂuxes for the
overproduction of speciﬁc molecules, yeast poses a more complex
challenge
1. Its central carbon metabolism is intricately regulated with a
‘ﬂat’ structure, involving over 100 TFs, 78% of which are interlinked
through cross-regulation in a large internal loop1. Due to this complex
system of transcriptional regulation, there have been limited suc-
cessful attempts to alter yeast’s cellular phenotype by manipulating
the activating or repressive TFs14,58,59. Previous studies have shown that
modifying TFs can result in increased yeast biomass and ethanol pro-
duction, although the improvements are typically modest
14,58. In line
with theseﬁndings, our study observed only a slight increase in 3-HP

levels after engineering theGCR1, GCR2,a n dMBP1 TFs (Fig.3a). This
may also be attributed to our limited understanding of yeast regula-
tion. To enhance our ability to engineer TFs in yeast, it is necessary to
employ additional methods, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation

comprehensive view of the yeast transcriptional landscape.
By examining 3-HP synthesis levels and metabolicﬂux changes
(Supplementary Fig. 19), we pinpointed three key metabolic nodes that
are pivotal in the central carbon metabolism when xylose serves as the
carbon source (Supplementary Fig. 20). During glycolysis, fructose
6-phosphate emerges as a critical node, steering carbonﬂux down-
stream to pyruvate through glycolysis and upstream to glucose
6-phosphate and the pentose phosphate pathway via gluconeogenesis
(Supplementary Fig. 9). At this juncture, PFK plays a decisive role in
controlling theﬂux direction (Fig.4e), which is essential for regulating
glycolysis when xylose is the carbon source. This contrasts with prior
research indicating that the glycolytic pathway’s rate is typically
controlled by PYK when glucose is the substrate
35. Pyruvate faces a
decision point: to enter mitochondria or proceed to the PDH bypass.
With glucose as the carbon source, the Crabtree effect directs carbon
toward the PDH bypass. However, with xylose, the Crabtree effect is
diminished, allowing greater carbon ﬂux into the TCA cycle. By
managing pyruvate transport and PDH bypass, we can activate the
Crabtree effect, thereby augmenting carbonﬂux to the PDH bypass
(Fig. 5a– e). Malonyl-CoA serves as a bifurcation for 3-HP and fatty acid
synthesis. By leveraging xylose-responsive promoters and biosensors
to modulate the expression of ACC mutants and FAS (Fig.5f– h), we
sucessfully redirected carbonﬂux toward 3-HP synthesis.
For the commodity chemical 3-HP, metrics such as titer, rate,
and yield are crucial. To maximize 3-HP synthesis, various meta-
bolic pathways have been developed using intermediates like
glycerol, β-alanine, and malonyl-CoA. Among these, the glycerol
pathway offers the shortest route from sugar to 3-HP but requires
the costly cofactor vitamin B12. For instance, 50 μMB 1 2w a s

needed to achieve 54.8 g/L 3-HP with a carbon yield of 0.49 g/g
sugar using glucose and xylose as carbon sources61. Additionally,
to maintain high production levels, inducers like 0.1 mM IPTG and
antibiotics such as 5 μg/mL chloramphenicol and/or 25 μg/mL
kanamycin were required, further increasing production costs
61.
In contrast, the β-alanine and malonyl-CoA pathways have gar-
nered more attention due to their avoidance of expensive
cofactors. By integrating theβ-alanine pathway into yeast strains
capable of consuming xylose and using controlled fed-batch
cultivation, the engineered strain achieved a 3-HP titer of
approximately 7.4 g/L within 120 h, with a product yield of 0.17 g/
gx y l o s e
62,63. By integrating β-alanine pathway genes into Asper-
gillus species and optimizing the cultivation conditions, the
conversion rate of 3-HP was increased to 0.24 g/g glucose and
xylose, resulting in ﬁnal concentrations of 36 g/L
64. The malonyl-
CoA pathway also showed promise. Through engineering oleagi-
nous yeast R. toruloides, which naturally has a highﬂux towards
malonyl-CoA, the obtained strain synthesized 45.4 g/L of 3-HP
with a yield of 0.11 g/g from glucose and xylose mixture

recently, by enhancing the co-utilization of glucose and xylose in
the industrial yeast Ogataea polymorpha , the obtained strain

mixture, respectively. In this work, we systematically engineered
the regulation of central carbon metabolism, resulting in a strain
capable of producing 7.46 g/L of 3-HP in shakeﬂask, with a sig-
niﬁcantly improved product yield of 0.37 g/g xylose (Supple-
mentary Data 8). This yield demonstrates an advantage in xylose
conversion efﬁciency over previously reported strains.
In conclusion, our research employed a systematic, modular
deregulation strategy on central carbon metabolism, resulting in a
signiﬁcant enhancement of the metabolic conversion of xylose into the
acetyl-CoA derivative 3-HP. Theﬁnal strain, RC32F2p8, exhibited a 4.7-
fold improvement compared to the module I-optimized strain R30c,
and approximately a 100-fold improvement compared to the initially
obtained strain X469p. To drive future advancements, it is necessary
to develop a more inclusive and streamlined regulatory framework
with a sophisticated strategy that adapts to changes in key metabolite
levels, ensuring efﬁcient and direct carbonﬂux towards acetyl-CoA-
derived products. Additional strategies to further increase 3-HP pro-
duction, such as engineering the efﬂux mechanisms of 3-HP to increase
extracellular secretion, employing laboratory evolution to enhance
tolerance to 3-HP, maintaining precise pH control to facilitate extra-
cellular dissociation of 3-HP and minimize its reuptake into the cell, as
well as developing rapid isolation methods for 3-HP during the fer-
mentation process.
Methods
Plasmids and strains
In this study, all plasmids are listed in Supplementary Data 1. The
plasmids were propagated in theE. colistrain DH5α.A l lS. cerevisiae
strains were derived from the parent strain IMX581
67, which is derived
from CEN.PK113-5D (MATa ura3-52 can1::cas9-natNT2 TRP1 LEU2 HIS3).
This parent strain features an integrated Cas9 expression cassette
regulated by the constitutive TEF1 promoter. Detailed information
about these strains is available in Supplementary Data 2. All exogenous
genes incorporated into the yeast were synthesized by Genscript and
codon-optimized for efﬁcient expression inS. cerevisiae(Supplemen-
tary Data 5).
Reagents
In this study, all primers were synthesized by either Sigma-Aldrich or
Euroﬁns. DNA-related procedures, including puriﬁcation, gel extrac-
tion, and plasmid isolation, were performed using kits acquired from
Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc. For high- ﬁdelity DNA polymerization,
Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase from New England Biolabs and
PrimeStar DNA polymerase from TaKaRa Bio were utilized. For PCR
validation, we utilized SapphireAmp Fast PCR Master Mix, sourced
from TaKaRa Bio. RNA extraction was carried out using the RNeasy
Mini Kit from Qiagen. Additionally, all chemicals employed in the study
were procured from Sigma-Aldrich or Merck Millipore.
Media
In this study,E. coli strains were selected and cultivated on Luria-
Bertani (LB) agar plates containing 50 mg/L ampicillin. Subsequent
liquid cultures were also grown in LB medium, supplemented with the
same concentration of ampicillin. Yeast competent cells were grown in
YPD medium, which contained 10 g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L peptone,
and 20 g/L glucose. For strains harboring URA3-based plasmids,
selection was performed using synthetic complete media devoid of
uracil (SD-URA). This medium comprised 6.7 g/L yeast nitrogen base
without amino acids (YNB), 0.77 g/L complete supplement mixture
without uracil (CSM-URA), 20 g/L glucose, and 20 g/L agar powder. To
counter-select against the URA3 marker, we used SD + 5’-FOA plates,
which contained 6.7 g/L YNB, 0.77 g/L CSM-URA, and 0.8 g/L
5-ﬂuoroorotic acid (5-FOA). Strains equipped with a kanMX cassette
were selected on YPD plates, supplemented with 200 mg/L G418,
sourced from Formedium. The minimal medium used consisted of
7.5 g/L (NH
4)2SO4,1 4 . 4g / LK H2PO4,a n d0 . 5g / LM g S O4·7H2O39.E i t h e r
20 g/L of xylose or 20 g/L of glucose served as the carbon source. This
medium was supplemented with vitamin and trace metal solutions,
and the pH was adjusted to 6.5 using KOH. When necessary, uracil
supplementation was added at a concentration of 60 mg/L.
Plasmid construction
To construct overexpression plasmids, we employed the Gibson
Assembly Master Mix from New England BioLabs, fusing the pSPGM2
vector with ampliﬁed gene fragments. For this ampliﬁcation, we used
the genomic DNA of IMX581 as the template for all native elements,
including promoters, genes, and terminators. In cases requiring
codon-optimized genes, synthetic sequences served as the ampliﬁca-
tion templates. Guide RNA (gRNA) plasmids were similarly assembled
using the Gibson Assembly Master Mix. To identify the optimal 20-bp
gRNA sequences targeting speciﬁcg e n e so rg e n o m i cl o c i ,w ec r o s s -

within the entire CEN.PK113-7D genome. This analysis was facilitated by

integrity of all generated plasmids was subsequently conﬁrmed
through sequencing.
Strain construction
We employed CRISPR/Cas9-based techniques for gene integration,
deletion, and knockdown, in line with methods previously
outlined
67. Brie ﬂy, to overexpress genes, we integrated gene
expression cassettes at genomic loci known for high-level and
stable heterologous gene expression via the CRISPR/Cas9 system
68.
Components of these cassettes, including homologous arms, pro-
moters, genes, and terminators, were ampliﬁed using Phusion high-
ﬁdelity DNA polymerase. Subsequently, PrimeSTAR high- ﬁdelity
polymerase was utilized to assemble these parts into the complete
gene expression cassette, following the overlap extension poly-
merase chain reaction (OE-PCR) procedure
69. For gene deletions, we
replaced the target gene’s open reading frame (ORF) with deletion
fragments containing 50-bp upstream sequences of the gene ’s
promoter and 50-bp downstream sequences of its terminator. For
promoter-based gene knockdowns, a fragment consisting of an
alternative promoter with varying strength is used to replace the
original promoter. This fragment isﬂanked on both sides by 50-bp
sequences that are homologous to the respective regions of the
gene and its native promoter. During yeast transformation, 500 ng

of DNA fragments were used to repair the chromosomal double-
strand break. Transformants were selected on SD-URA plates for
3 days. In an alternative gene deletion strategy, the KanMX marker
was employed. Two homologous arms, each ranging between 400
and 600 bp, were ampliﬁed from IMX581 genomic DNA. The KanMX
gene was similarly ampliﬁed using the pUG6 plasmid as a template.
These elements were then fused to form the deletion cassette via
the above-mentioned OE-PCR method. 1μg of DNA fragments were
used to facilitate the homologous recombination. Transformed
colonies were isolated by culturing on YPD agar plates containing
200 mg/L of G418 for 3 days. The colonies were then cultured
overnight in YPD medium. Genomic DNA was extracted using a
protocol previously described
70.S p e c iﬁcally, cells were treated with
a 0.2 M lithium acetate solution containing 1% SDS and subse-
quently heated at 75 °C for 15 min. Genomic DNA was precipitated
and puriﬁed in 70% ethanol, followed by drying and dissolution in
50 μL water. The successful integration or deletion was conﬁrmed
through PCR ampliﬁcation using appropriate primer pairs.
Growth measurement
Growth measurements were conducted using the Growth Proﬁler
960 system. Individual colonies were inoculated into 2 mL of minimal
medium and incubated with 200 rpm agitation overnight. Following
incubation, the preculture was centrifuged at 3000 ×g for 5 min to
separate the supernatant from the cell pellet. The cell pellet was then
resuspended in an uracil-free minimal medium to achieve an initial
optical density (OD
600) of 0.1. Subsequently, 250μL of the cell sus-
pension was cultivated in 96-well microplates under conditions of
250 rpm agitation and a temperature of 30 °C. OD
600 were derived
from a standard curve generated by correlating green values
obtained from the Growth Proﬁler with OD
600 readings taken from a
spectrophotometer.
Promoter strength measurement
Promoter sequences (Supplementary Data 4), along with the
homologous arms, ﬂuorescent proteins (either GFP or RFP), and
terminators, were assembled through OE-PCR. These assembled
fragments were integrated into the yeast chromosome at the XI-1
locus using the CRISPR/Cas9 methodology described above. Suc-
cessfully transformed colonies were cultured overnight in 2 mL of
minimal medium, agitated at 200 rpm. Post-incubation, the cultures
were centrifuged for 5 min at 3000 ×g to pellet the cells, separating
them from the supernatant. The resulting cell pellets were resus-
pended in minimal medium supplemented with either 2% glucose or
2% xylose as the carbon source, and the initial OD
600 was calibrated
to approximately 0.1. One milliliter of this resuspended culture was
then transferred to a 48-well FlowerPlate, with a shaking frequency
set at 1200 rpm. Fluorescent signals were quantiﬁed using excita-
tion/emission wavelengths of 485/515 nm for GFP and 588/633 nm
for RFP. Allﬂuorescence readings were background-corrected and
normalized to the OD
600.
Flask cultivation
Three biological replicates of yeast colonies were pre-cultured in 2 mL
of minimal medium and subjected to overnight incubation at 30 °C
with agitation at 200 rpm. A designated volume of the cell culture was
then centrifuged at 3000 ×g for 5 min to pellet the cells. Subsequently,
the cells were washed with water through an additional 5-min cen-
trifugation at 3000 ×g. The washed cells were then transferred to
125 mL shakeﬂasks containing 20 mL of minimal medium, supple-
mented with 2% glucose or 2% xylose as the carbon source. The initial
OD
600 was adjusted to approximately 0.1. The cultures were then
incubated at 30 °C with agitation at 200 rpm. For strains used to cal-
culate the synthesis rate of the product, we collect samples every three
hours to measure the 3-HP content.
Fermentation
Pre-cultures of R30C, RC10Bp, and RC32F2p8 were grown in minimal
medium containing 2% glucose and used to inoculate 20 mL of the
same medium in 100 mL shakeﬂasks. Bioreactor fermentations for
3-HP production were conducted using the DASGIP® Parallel Bior-
eactor System (Eppendorf, Germany). Batch fermentations were per-
formed in 0.6 L of minimal medium with 2% xylose. The temperature
was maintained at 30 °C, and the pH was controlled at 6.0 through the
automatic addition of 2 M KOH. Agitation was adjusted between 400
and 800 rpm to ensure dissolved oxygen levels exceeded 30%, with
airﬂow set to 1 vvm. Batch cultures were initiated by adding all medium
components to the reactor, followed by inoculation to achieve an
initial OD
600 of 0.1. CO2 production was monitored by analyzing
exhaust gases. The samples were withdrawn every three hours for
OD
600 and metabolites analysis. To investigate the correlation
between OD600 and dry cell weight (DCW), we diluted the broth to six
different OD600 values. Then, 5 mL of each dilution wasﬁltered
through a pre-weighed 0.45-µm ﬁlter membrane (Sartorius Biolab,
Göttingen, Germany). Theﬁlter was washed once prior to brothﬁl-
tration and three times afterwards, each time using 5 mL of deionized
water. All ﬁlters were dried in an incubator at 50 °C until constant
weight was achieved before measuring the weight increase. The cal-
culated DCW/OD
600 ratio was 0.45, 0.64, and 0.66 for strain R30C,
RC10Bp, and RC32F2p8, respectively.
Metabolites measurement
One milliliter of the cultured sample was centrifuged for 3 min at
10,000 ×g to separate the cells from the supernatant. The supernatant
was thenﬁltered using a 0.2μms y r i n g eﬁlter. Metabolite concentra-
tions were analyzed using a modiﬁed version of a previously estab-
lished HPLC method
22.S p e c iﬁcally, an HPLC system from Shimadzu
(Japan) equipped with an Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
USA) was used. The column was maintained at 65 °C, and 0.5 mM
H
2SO4 served as the mobile phase,ﬂowing at a rate of 0.4 mL/min over
a 30-min analysis period. Concentrations of 3-HP, xylose, xylitol, pyr-
uvate, succinate, glycerol, acetate, and ethanol were detected using an
RI-101 Refractive Index Detector. Forﬂaviolin detection, samples were
taken in the stationary phase (72 h) and centrifuged at 13,000 ×g for
10 minutes at 4 °C. The absorbance ofﬂaviolin was then detected using
a Genesys 10UV-VIS spectrophotometer (Fisher ScientiﬁcB V B A ,
Brussel, Belgium) at 340 nm
57.
Theoretical yield calculation
The maximum theoretical yield of 3-HP was calculated using a pre-
viously established method that involves Flux Balance Analysis (FBA)
71.
Speciﬁcally, we utilized the genome-scale metabolic model Yeast8 for
S. cerevisiae72, into which both the xylose metabolic pathway and the
3-HP production pathway were integrated by adding the respective
reactions. Additionally, any genes that were deleted in the experi-
mental strain were represented by the removal of corresponding
reactions from the genome-scale model. The maximal secretion rate of
3-HP was then computed by setting aﬁx e dx y l o s eu p t a k er a t eo f
1 mmol per gram of dry weight per hour. All simulations were con-
ducted in MATLAB using the COBRA Toolbox
73.
RNA-seq
Yeast cells, grown in minimal medium with glucose, xylose, or ethanol
as the carbon source, were harvested at an OD
600 of approximately 1
a n dt h e ns t o r e da t−80 °C until RNA extraction. The RNeasy Mini Kit
was employed for total RNA isolation, and the RNA quality was sub-
sequently veriﬁed using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, following the
manufacturer’s guidelines. Libraries for RNA sequencing were pre-
pared with the Illumina TruSeq Sample Preparation Kit v2, incorpor-
ating a poly-A enrichment step. The prepared samples were clustered
using cBot and sequenced as paired end reads (2 × 150 bp) on a HiSeq

2500 platform, in accordance with the manufacturer’si n s t r u c t i o n s .
Raw sequencing reads from each sample were aligned to the CEN.PK
113-7D reference genome, available athttp://cenpk.tudelft.nl,u s i n g
TopHat version 2.0.12
74. Gene expression levels were quantiﬁed as
FPKM values using Cufﬂinks version 2.2.166, while raw read counts
were determined using the feature Counts module of the Subread
package version 1.4.6
75,76. Differential gene expression analysis was
conducted using the DESeq2 method77.
TFs analysis
To assess the signiﬁcance of expression changes in gene sets regulated
by TFs, we utilized the Platform for Integrative Analysis of Omics
(PIANO) R package
78. This package calculates the signiﬁcance of
changes in gene expression, taking into account the modulation in the
expression levels of genes under the control of speciﬁcT F s
79. Infor-
mation about these TFs was sourced from the Yeast Search for Tran-
scriptional Regulators and Consensus Tracking Plus database
(YEASTRACT+), accessible at http://YEASTRACT-PLUS.org/. Impor-
tantly, only TFs with substantiated evidence of DNA binding and
expression were considered for analysis in this study. As input, we used
the differential expression levels of genes (expressed as Log2 fold
changes) along with their corresponding signiﬁcance levels, which
were adjusted using the Benjamini– Hochberg method for multiple
comparisons.
FBA
To perform theﬂux balance analysis (FBA), we constructed a modiﬁed
model of the latest yeast GEM80 by adding the heterologous pathway to
3-HP, GAPN and xylose isomerase. To estimate theﬂux distribution, we
constrained the related exchange rates based on the measurments of
3-HP, xylose, xylitol, pyruvate, succinate, glycerol, acetate, ethanol,
and CO
2 (Supplementary Data 9). We then performed pFBA to obtain a
parsimoniousﬂux distribution and applied 1000 random samplings of
the solution space using the Hit and Run algorithm81. All simulations
were done in MATLAB with the COBRA toolbox73.
Statistical analysis
The signiﬁcance of differences between different groups was eval-
uated using the two-tailed Student’s t test (* representsp < 0.05; **
represents p < 0.01, and *** representsp < 0.001). The statistical ana-
lysis of RNA-seq data, utilizing the Benjamini– Hochberg method, was
carried out using the R programming language (available athttp://
www.r-project.org).
