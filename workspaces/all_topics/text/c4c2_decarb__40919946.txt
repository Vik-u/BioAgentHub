ABSTRACT Histoplasma capsulatum  is a human fungal pathogen that survives and 
proliferates within phagocytic immune cells. To sustain growth in the nutrient-limited 
phagosome environment, the pathogenic yeast scavenges available carbon sources, 
which must be metabolized through central carbon metabolism for respiration and 
biomass synthesis. However, Histoplasma carbon metabolic pathways operating in the 
pathogenic yeast phase have not been extensively mapped. To address this gap, we 
employed a fluxomic platform using stable isotope tracers to quantify the cellular 
reaction rates of central carbon metabolism. This approach revealed that, in Histo­
plasma yeasts, carbon resides within five main reservoirs: fatty acids, proteins, mannitol, 
nucleic acids, and cell wall components. Carbon conversion efficiency, or biomass yield, 
was approximately 50%, indicating substantial CO 2 loss from supplemented carbon 
substrates, glucose , and glutamate. 13C-labeling analysis demonstrated simultaneous 
glycolysis and gluconeogenesis, and enriched serine labeling confirmed threonine 
aldolase activity in serine biosynthesis. Compartmentalization of pyruvate metabolism 
was evident from the labeling of amino acids derived from pyruvate, with the methylci­
trate cycle identified as the primary source of labeled pyruvate. Notably, malic enzyme 
and pyruvate carboxylase exhibited negligible fluxes, while mitochondrial reactions, 
particularly CO 2-producing ones, were the most active. These results offer insight into 
key metabolic reactions, alternative pathways, and metabolite/enzyme compartmentali­
zation in Histoplasma yeast metabolism. This foundational framework supports future 
studies aimed at identifying metabolic targets for novel histoplasmosis therapeutics.
IMPORTANCE To our knowledge, this study represents the first application of 13C-met­
abolic flux analysis to a human fungal pathogen, where we identified carbon res­
ervoirs and quantified the metabolic fluxes of pathogenic Histoplasma yeasts. Our 
findings demonstrated that Histoplasma metabolizes carbon toward cellular respiration 
to robustly produce CO 2 and energy but also uses alternative pathways within cen­
tral metabolism for biosynthesis. Given the potential for other pathogenic fungi to 
share similar metabolic features, especially biomass, our study offers a comprehensive 
framework for deciphering fungal metabolism, providing insights into their infection-
enabling metabolism and offering a foundation for identifying new therapeutic targets.

istoplasma capsulatum , a human pathogen and the etiological agent of histo­
plasmosis, is responsible for the most common endemic mycosis in the United 
States ( 1–3). Human infection results from aerosolization and inhalation of conidia 
released from soil containing Histoplasma mycelia. Within the mammalian lung, conidia 
transition into pathogenic yeasts which then infect alveolar phagocytes ( 4, 5). Endemic 
to the Ohio and Mississippi River valleys, Histoplasma poses a significant threat to

immunocompromised individuals, where infection can lead to severe respiratory disease 
and high mortality as the pathogen disseminates to other organs (6–8).
Despite Histoplasma’s significant impact, detailed insights into the central carbon 
metabolism of its pathogenic yeast phase and how it channels carbon through its 
metabolic pathways remain elusive. Genetic studies have shown that Histoplasma 
utilizes gluconeogenesis to process host-derived substrates within the nutrient-limi­
ted macrophage phagosome ( 9). More recent research revealed that Histoplasma is a 
Crabtree-negative yeast, favoring oxidative phosphorylation over alcoholic fermentation 
when both glucose and oxygen are available ( 10). Supporting these findings, a prior 
study demonstrated a reduction in enzymes associated with alcoholic fermentation and 
an increase in tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle enzymes during the transition from the 
mycelial to yeast form (11).
Additionally, whether alternative metabolic pathways in Histoplasma, including malic 
enzyme, the glyoxylate cycle, and the methylcitrate cycle, contribute to yeast phase 
metabolism has not been fully determined. These pathways have primarily been inferred 
through genome annotation and transcriptomic analyses rather than direct metabolic 
evidence, leaving their functional activity unresolved. For example, even though a malic 
enzyme ortholog ( MAE1) has been annotated ( 12), previous evidence indicates that 
Histoplasma may lack malic enzyme function ( 9, 13). Likewise, glyoxylate and methyl­
citrate cycle enzymes were found to be downregulated two- to fourfold during its 
dimorphic shift from mycelia to yeasts ( 11), further questioning their activity, especially 
given that glyoxylate metabolism is not required for virulence ( 9). It also remains 
unclear if the methylcitrate cycle is required for virulence, possibly through catabolism 
of host-derived amino acids to propionyl-CoA, which may activate the methylcitrate 
cycle ( 14). These unresolved uncertainties in Histoplasma’s central carbon metabolism 
highlight the need for further investigation, as a clearer understanding could reveal 
potential metabolic vulnerabilities that may serve as targets for novel therapeutic 
interventions.
13C-metabolic flux analysis (MFA) offers a metabolic map that can be used to infer 
the role of different metabolic pathways ( 15–18). This technique relies on the incor­
poration of stable isotope-labeled substrates into a biological system. As the metab­
olites in the system achieve metabolic and isotopic steady state, where metabolite 
labeling and concentrations remain constant due to a balance between production and 
consumption, precise mass isotopomer distribution can be measured (19). These labeling 
patterns enable the calculation of metabolic fluxes, or reaction rates, by solving a 
system of equations that account for carbon inputs (e.g., substrates consumed), outputs 
(e.g., biomass accumulation and CO 2 production), and carbon redistribution through 
metabolic reactions. Computer-aided modeling subsequently provides the best fit of the 
experimental isotope data with the predicted isotope data in conjunction with the built 
network to generate a flux map of central carbon metabolism (20).
Recent advancements in isotope tracing have made the measurement of intracellu­
lar metabolism rates an essential tool for developing novel therapies for some of the 
most concerning and prevalent diseases. For example, in breast cancer research, stable 
isotope modeling identified fluxes elevated by the Warburg effect ( 21), which were 
targeted by inhibitors, leading to tumor remission in vitro (22). Similarly, labeling of other 
cancer cell lines in vitro  and in vivo  identified a reductive TCA cycle driving fatty acid 
synthesis ( 23, 24). In Mycobacterium tuberculosis , 13C-flux spectral analysis, an approach 
akin to MFA, identified key amino acids accessible to the pathogen and highlighted CO 2 
fixation via anaplerotic reactions within macrophage phagosomes ( 25). These examples 
demonstrate the prospects of MFA to reveal metabolic vulnerabilities, paving the way for 
new therapeutic strategies across various diseases.
In this study, MFA was employed to investigate Histoplasma’s central carbon 
metabolism in its pathogenic yeast phase. By determining its biomass composition, rate 
of substrate uptake, and tracking the incorporation of 13C-labeled substrates into central 
metabolism, we generated a detailed carbon flux map of pathogenic-phase cells that

identifies highly active reactions, reveals alternative metabolic pathways, and suggests 
possible metabolic compartmentalization within yeast cells.
RESULTS
Histoplasma respires half of all consumed carbon
Fatty acids, proteins, nucleic acids, and carbohydrates are typically the primary 
reservoirs of carbon in yeasts ( 26–30). Accordingly, the biomass composition of 
Histoplasma yeast grown in liquid culture was assessed based on these components 
(Fig. 1A ). For carbohydrates, previous research has shown Histoplasma yeasts produce 
the sugar alcohol mannitol in high abundance ( 10), but glycogen levels were under the 
limit of detection (data not shown; limit of detection = 0.18/100 g). Biomass analysis 
showed that fatty acids constituted 8.8% ± 0.8% of the total dry weight (DW; wt/wt), 
proteins 49.0% ± 1.2%, mannitol 15.5% ± 1.5%, and nucleic acids 3.6% ± 0.3%. The 
remaining DW was attributed to cell wall mass (23.1% ± 3.8%). Analysis of the fatty acyl 
chain distribution ( Fig. 1B) revealed that palmitic acid (C16:0), stearic acid (C18:0), oleic 
acid (C18:1), and linoleic acid (C18:2) were the predominant fatty acids in Histoplasma 
yeasts, accounting for 96.0 mol% ± 2.5 mol% of the total fatty acids. Odd-chain fatty 
acids were also detected but were only 1.2 mol% ± 0.3 mol% of the total fatty acid types. 
The composition of proteinogenic amino acids ( Fig. 1C ) showed glutamate/glutamine 
as the most prevalent amino acids incorporated into proteins, constituting 23.0 mol% ± 
0.6 mol%, with aspartate/asparagine and alanine following at 10.6 mol% ± 0.1 mol% and 
8.9 mol% ± 0.3 mol%, respectively. Lastly, analysis of the monosaccharide composition 
of the cell wall ( Fig. 1D) revealed that glucose, arising from glucans, and galactose and 
mannose, which can glycosylate cell wall proteins or together form galactomannan, were 
the only detectable carbohydrate monomers. Glucose was predominant, comprising 89.5 
mol% ± 0.6 mol% of the monosaccharides in the cell wall, while mannose and galactose 
were present in a precise 3:1 ratio, accounting for 7.9 mol% ± 0.4 mol% and 2.6 mol% ± 
0.1 mol%, respectively.
The efficiency of Histoplasma yeasts in converting substrates into biomass, also 
known as carbon conversion efficiency (CCE) or biomass yield, was determined by 
measuring the depletion of carbon substrates (glucose and glutamate) from rich growth 
medium over a 67 h incubation period and by quantifying the biomass components 
produced in µmol of carbon per mg DW (µmol C mg DW −1). The total carbon consumed 
from the medium was found to be 83.6 ± 17.8 µmol C mg DW −1, with 54.6 ± 13.7 µmol C 
mg DW−1 derived from glucose and 29.0 ± 4.1 µmol C mg DW−1 from glutamate. The total 
carbon stored in biomass components was 42.1 ± 3.2 µmol C mg DW −1, consisting of 5.6 
± 0.5, 22.6 ± 0.6, 5.1 ± 0.5, 0.5 ± 0.1, and 8.4 ± 1.6 µmol C mg DW −1 in lipids, proteins, 
mannitol, nucleic acids, and cell wall, respectively. Therefore, the CCE of Histoplasma 
was estimated at 50.4 ± 3.8% ( Fig. 2), where 49.6 ± 3.8% of the carbon consumed by 
Histoplasma was lost as metabolic byproducts, presumably CO 2 as yeasts do not ferment 
glucose to ethanol or acetate ( 10). Based on the CCE, central metabolic reactions such as 
6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, isocitrate dehydrogen­
ase, and/or alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase likely contain high flux to accommodate 
the production of CO2 measured.
13C-labeling of Histoplasma yeasts
Glucose and glutamate were selected as carbon substrates for Histoplasma growth to 
provide parallel 13C-labeling data within central metabolism ( 16, 17, 31–33). Specifically, 
80% [1,2- 13C2]glucose + 20% [U- 13C6]glucose was expected to distinguish between 
glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, while 100% [U- 13C5]glutamate was 
intended to enrich intermediates of the TCA cycle and monitor potential gluconeogen­
esis ( 15–18, 34–36). The isotopic steady state of these metabolites was verified by 
incubating Histoplasma yeasts for 67 h with a 20% [U- 13C6]glucose and 20% [U- 13C5]glu­
tamate mixture. Intracellular metabolites were extracted, and their isotopomer labeling

was determined as outlined in the “Materials and Methods” section. For each metabo­
lite, the average carbon labeling percentage was calculated as previously described 
(18), demonstrating that 34 out of the 47 analyzed metabolites reached isotopic 
steady state, with an average 13C-labeling between 18.0 and 24.0% ( Table S1 ), simi­
lar to the labeling percentage of the carbon in the growth medium. Alanine, gluta­
mine, glycine, lysine, methionine, and proline exhibited labeling percentages above 
the 24.0% threshold, likely due to interference from co-eluting compounds at the

(light gray). Monomer composition is based on ( B) acyl chains of the polar and nonpolar lipids, ( C) 
proteinogenic amino acids, and ( D) monosaccharides within the cell wall. Error bars represent standard 
deviations of five biological replicates. Cell wall error bars represent the sum of all standard deviations 
from other biomass components.

selected precursor/product ion transitions which increased their average carbon labeling 
percentages. Conversely, glutamate, 2-phosphoglycolate, glucose 1-phosphate/mannose 
1-phosphate, alpha-ketoglutarate, succinate, glucose, and inositol were below the 18.0% 
threshold, likely due to dilution of the 13C-label by unlabeled compartmentalized and 
inactive pools of the respective metabolites. Due to these reasons, metabolites outside of 
the 18.0–24.0% threshold were excluded from further analyses.
Parallel labeling data from 29 of the 34 metabolites were included in the subsequent 
metabolic model from yeasts grown in the following media: 80% [1,2- 13C2]glucose + 20% 
[U-13C6]glucose with unlabeled glutamate and unlabeled glucose with 100% [U- 13C5]glu­
tamate ( Table S2 ). Asparagine and tryptophan were omitted from the model due to 
their absence from proteinogenic amino acid data, as they are degraded during the acid 
hydrolysis process used to break down proteins into their constituent amino acids ( 37). 
Mannose 6-phosphate, sorbitol 6-phosphate, and N-acetylglucosamine 1-phosphate 
were excluded due to redundancy in the model, as they did not contribute to any 
experimentally measured outputs as substrates.
To identify pathway trends with 13C-enrichment, the average carbon labeling 
percentages were mapped onto central metabolic pathways ( Fig. 3). When 13C-glucose 
was the source of carbon label in the glucose and glutamate-containing growth medium 
(Fig. 3A ), the most abundant labeling percentages in yeasts were predictably within 
intermediates in the upper portion of glycolysis. For instance, glucose 6-phosphate, 
the first product of glycolysis, showed a labeling percentage of 46.7% ± 0.2% while 
metabolites further away from the labeling entry point illustrated a steady decline in 
labeling percentages. Similarly, with 13C-glutamate in the growth medium ( Fig. 3B), TCA 
intermediates had an average carbon labeling of 54.7–67.2%, while label of intermedi­
ates of upper glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway ranged from 3.4 to 6.6% 
(Table S2 ), significantly higher than the natural abundance of 13C at 1.1%. As both 
labeling experiments were performed using media with both glucose and glutamate 
carbon sources, these observations indicate that both glycolysis and gluconeogenesis 
FIG 2 Half of the carbon uptaken by Histoplasma is lost as CO 2. 50.4% of carbon consumed from the media is sunk into 
biomass components: fatty acids (yellow), protein (green), mannitol (blue), nucleic acid (brown), and cell wall (light gray). The 
remaining 49.6% of carbon consumed was attributed to CO 2 release (dark gray). Values are the average of five biological 
replicates ± standard deviation. The standard deviation for the cell wall component includes the cumulative standard 
deviations from all other biomass fractions, and the CO 2 standard deviation accounts for the summed standard deviations of 
the biomass components.

pathways are simultaneously active in Histoplasma. Additionally, serine’s 13C-labeling 
with glutamate averaged 22.3% ± 4.7%, whereas its direct precursor, 3-phosphoglycer­
ate, was lower (13.0% ± 1.2%; Table S2), suggesting an alternative serine biosynthesis 
pathway possibly via threonine aldolase ( 38). Lastly, valine and leucine, synthesized 
exclusively from mitochondrial pyruvate ( 39, 40), exhibited 9.7% higher labeling than 
the measured total pyruvate pool ( Fig. 3B ). This discrepancy supports the existence 
of compartmentalized pyruvate pools, where mitochondrial pyruvate is generated 
independently of the cytosolic pool. With growth on 13C-glutamate, increased labeling 
of branched-chain amino acids could result from mitochondrial pyruvate production 
via either mitochondrial malic enzyme or the methylcitrate cycle, which metabolizes 
propionyl-CoA biosynthesized from 2-oxobutanoate, where 2-oxobutanoate is derived

from oxaloacetate. In contrast, the lack of differences in pyruvate and valine/leucine 
carbon labeling with 13C-glucose, where labeled pyruvate would be derived from 
glycolysis, suggests that the cytosolic pyruvate pool is larger and not significantly diluted 
by the mitochondrial pyruvate fraction.
Metabolic modeling and validation
A metabolic model ( Table S3) was built using the isotopomer network compartmental 
analysis (INCA v2.3, http://mfa.vueinnovations.com, Vanderbilt University) ( 20) within 
MATLAB 2023b (MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) using information from the Kyoto 
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ( 38), current literature on the enzymes and 
metabolites produced by Histoplasma (10–12, 41), and the labeling data obtained in 
this study ( Table S2 ). The network of carbon atom transitions was adapted from one 
previously published (18). Regarding directionality, Histoplasma performs both glycolysis 
and gluconeogenesis simultaneously ( Fig. 3 ). Therefore, Vhk and Vpfk were modeled 
as bidirectional to simulate the enzymes catalyzing the reverse reactions: glucose 
6-phosphatase and fructose 1,6-bisphosphatase, respectively. This is further supported 
by the observed isotopic scrambling, where labeling with 13C-glucose results in M +

aFlux values, expressed in nmol h −1 mg DW −1, were calculated using INCA software. Vglcup and Vgluup were determined by LC-MS/MS following 67 h of istoplasma 
incubation. These rates, along with their standard deviations, were treated as free fluxes and fitted using the flux estimation tool. Vwall, Vfas1, Vfas2, Vmaneff, Vpyrim, 
Vpurine, and all amino acid effluxes were quantified based on DW and biomass accumulation after 67 h. Proteinogenic amino acid effluxes were set as constrained values 
in the model. All other fluxes were derived from the model based on 13C-labeling quantification after 67 h incubation with 80% [1,2- 13C2]glucose + 20% [U-13C6]glucose and 
100% [U-13C5]glutamate. Values represent the best-fit optimized flux means with their 95% confidence intervals (CI).

3 isotopologues in hexose phosphates due to aldolase and gluconeogenic reactions 
(35). Reactions involved in central metabolism that are known to be thermodynamically 
unfavorable, including Vpk, Vme, Vpyrc, Vpyr, Vpdh, Vcs, Vatpcl, Vkgdh, Vg6pdh, V6pgdh, 
Vms, Voxo, Vmetcit, Vimetcit, and Vmicl, were implemented as unidirectional in INCA 
according to their conventional directionality. However, isocitrate dehydrogenase (Vidh) 
was maintained as bidirectional due to increasing evidence of its reversibility in various 
organisms (34, 35, 42, 43). Regarding compartmentalization, the model also incorporated 
separate pools of pyruvate, with mitochondrial pyruvate allocated for branched-chain 
amino acid biosynthesis and cytosolic pyruvate for alanine biosynthesis. The measured 
mass isotopomer distribution of pyruvate ( Table S2) was assigned to the cytosolic pool 
due to its inferred larger relative abundance. Glyoxylate, malic enzyme, and methylcitrate 
cycle reactions were included based on the detection of their enzymes and intermedi­
ates in the literature ( 10, 11, 41), and for the latter two, the increased labeling observed 
in branched-chain amino acids derived from mitochondrial pyruvate ( Fig. 3B). Similarly, 
threonine aldolase was added to the model, supported by the observed average carbon 
labeling of serine (22.3% ± 4.7%) compared to its precursor, 3-phosphoglycerate (13.0% 
± 1.2%; Table S2), indicating an alternative serine biosynthesis pathway.
The model’s calculated net and exchange fluxes are presented in Table 1, with net 
fluxes visualized in Fig. 4. The consistency between the experimental and model-predic­
ted labeling patterns ( Fig. S1 ) was used to assess the goodness of fit, using methods 
previously outlined ( 16–18). Plotting of the experimental mass isotopomer distributions 
versus the model-predicted mass isotopomer distributions for each measured metabo­
lite provided a means to evaluate the model’s accuracy. The resulting linear regression 
showed a slope close to one and a coefficient of determination ( R2) near 1, indicating 
strong agreement between the simulated and observed labeling data and supporting 
the model’s ability to accurately represent in culture fluxes in Histoplasma. To account for 
the ambiguous subcellular localizations of pyruvate carboxylase ( 44), malate synthase, 
and methylisocitrate lyase in fungi ( 45), flux estimation was repeated using multiple 
localization assignments for acetyl-CoA and pyruvate, aiming to minimize residuals 
between predicted and observed isotopologues. Residuals were minimized by these 
adjustments (data not shown), and in the revised model, pyruvate carboxylase produced 
a net flux of less than 0.1 regardless of localization. Conversely, malate synthase, and 
methylisocitrate lyase resulted in the lowest residuals when assigned to mitochondrial 
localization.
Analysis of the flux estimation results revealed that all reactions operate with positive 
net fluxes in their conventional forward direction ( Fig. 4). Excluding biomass-producing 
reactions, the largest fluxes in Histoplasma’s central metabolism were associated with 
the TCA cycle. Notably, malate dehydrogenase catalyzed the highest flux (216.6 ± 36.5 
nmol h −1 mg DW −1), followed closely by fumarase (209.3 ± 21.7 nmol h −1 mg DW −1) 
and succinate dehydrogenase (207.7 ± 21.3 nmol h −1 mg DW −1). Alpha-ketoglutarate 
dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase also exhibited substantial fluxes of 149.7 
± 11.6 and 137.6 ± 10.5 nmol h −1 mg DW −1, respectively. Oppositely, the smallest fluxes 
in Histoplasma’s central metabolism included pyruvate carboxylase (<0.1 ± 25.4 nmol 
h−1 mg DW −1), malic enzyme (4.1 ± 15.3 nmol h −1 mg DW −1), all nonoxidative pentose 
phosphate pathway reactions (10.7 −13.6 ± 1.5 nmol h −1 mg DW −1), and glyoxylate cycle 
reactions (11.4 ± 7.5 nmol h−1 mg DW−1).
As half of the carbon uptaken by Histoplasma was lost as CO 2 (Fig. 2 ), CO 2 out­
put by CO 2-producing reactions was analyzed, where mitochondrial fluxes similarly 
represented the largest contributions. Specifically, 72.7% of total CO 2 yield occurred 
through alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, and isocitrate 
dehydrogenase ( Table 1 ). An additional 9.5% of CO 2 was generated during the con­
version of 2-oxobutanoate to propionyl-CoA via the branched-chain-keto acid dehy­
drogenase complex located within the mitochondrial inner membrane ( 46). The fifth 
largest CO2-producing flux was attributed to 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase in the 
oxidative pentose phosphate pathway, accounting for 8.0% of total CO2 production.

DISCUSSION
This study explored the central carbon metabolism of Histoplasma in its pathogenic yeast 
phase. By quantifying the distribution of major biomass components and analyzing their 
carbon precursors, a profile of Histoplasma’s substrate utilization and carbon allocation 
was generated. Subsequent 13C-labeling experiments supported these carbon contribu­
tions and identified active metabolic pathways and potential compartmentalization of 
metabolic reactions. Altogether, the analysis of labeling patterns and flux values revealed 
key features of Histoplasma’s central metabolism, including highly active and minimally 
utilized carbon pathways, alternative metabolic routes, and evidence of compartmental­
ized metabolism. We acknowledge that a limitation of this study is the use of Histoplasma 
yeasts grown in liquid culture, chosen due to the feasibility of MFA in defined media. 
While the nutrient environment may differ from that within host macrophages, we 
incorporated both glucose and glutamate in the medium and performed 13C-labeling 
experiments to assess major carbon entry points. Several flux patterns observed are 
consistent with previous findings related to intracellular yeast metabolism, indicating 
the relevance of results from in vitro culture. For example, flux analysis showed minimal 
activity of the glyoxylate cycle consistent with its dispensability for intracellular growth 
(9). The activity of gluconeogenesis, even when ample glucose is available in the growth 
medium, is also consistent with findings that gluconeogenesis is necessary for intracel­
lular growth of Histoplasma yeasts. Finally, the finding that the methylcitrate cycle is 
active suggests its importance in catabolism of some amino acids (see below) rather than 
odd-chain fatty acids, which were largely absent ( Fig. 1B), aligning with implications of 
recent studies on intracellular metabolism ( 9, 10, 47, 48). Thus, the findings of our study, 
particularly the flux defined by 13C-glutamate labeling of yeasts grown in vitro, provide an 
important framework on which many pathways relevant to intracellular yeasts are found.
Carbon utilization for energy versus biomass in Histoplasma
Biomass yield (CCE) in Histoplasma yeast growth exhibited a CCE of 50.4% ± 3.8% when 
grown aerobically on glucose and glutamate, consistent with other yeast species that 
show CCE yields between 40 and 60% ( 29, 49–51). Since Histoplasma is an obligate 
aerobe (52) and ethanol was not detected under normoxic conditions ( 10), the observed 
high flux through mitochondrial reactions, especially CO2 production, was expected (Fig. 
4). Oppositely, we found a lack of flux through pyruvate carboxylase activity despite 
detection of pyruvate carboxylase in proteomic studies ( 53–55) and RNA-sequencing 
data ( 12). This enzyme, a key contributor to anaplerosis by replenishing TCA cycle 
intermediates during gluconeogenesis, showed zero flux in the model regardless of 
modeling its localization to the cytosol or mitochondria. One possible explanation for the 
discrepancy is that pyruvate carboxylase activity was allosterically inhibited by glutamate 
(56–58), which accumulated in Histoplasma under carbon-rich conditions ( 10). Alterna­
tively, because the cited proteomic studies were performed on secreted vesicles, they 
may not accurately reflect the intracellular proteome. It is also possible that Histoplasma 
pyruvate carboxylase has intrinsically low enzymatic activity.
Pyruvate is generated through multiple pathways
The 13C-labeling patterns of sugar phosphates when yeasts were cultured with 13C-gluta­
mate were significantly higher than the natural 13C abundance (1.1%) (Fig. 3B), indicating 
active gluconeogenesis and corroborating prior genetic studies in Histoplasma (9). This 
enrichment predominantly occurred via phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, which 
converted M + 4 oxaloacetate to M + 3 phosphoenolpyruvate ( Table S2). However, the 
M + 3 isotopomer abundance of phosphoenolpyruvate (10.8%) was lower than that of 
pyruvate (18.6%), suggesting that alternative pathways contribute to pyruvate synthesis 
than from glycolysis ( Fig. 5 ). Potential avenues for pyruvate production include the 
mitochondrial malic enzyme (decarboxylation of malate to pyruvate) or methylisocitrate 
lyase (part of the methylcitrate cycle for metabolism of propionyl-CoA from amino

acids and beta-oxidation of odd-chain fatty acids). MFA resolved these two possibilities, 
revealing that malic enzyme plays a minimal role in mitochondrial pyruvate production, 
whereas methylisocitrate lyase accounted for over a quarter of its synthesis ( Fig. 4 ). 
These findings highlight the active role of the methylcitrate cycle in Histoplasma’s central 
metabolism and align with earlier findings of inactive malic enzyme activity in pyruvate 
kinase-deficient yeasts ( 9). Furthermore, this indicates that mitochondrial pyruvate is 
separate from cytosolic pyruvate pools and suggests that methylisocitrate lyase may 
be compartmentalized in the mitochondria. Had either of these mechanisms been 
functional in the cytosol, they would have at least partially compensated for pyruvate 
kinase deficiency that led to abolished growth under gluconeogenic amino acids, as 
previously reported (9).
The potential of methylcitrate and mannitol cycles in production of reducing 
power
The methylcitrate cycle appears to play a broader role in mitochondrial metabolism 
beyond its traditional function in detoxifying propionate derived from amino acid 
and odd-chain fatty acid catabolism ( 59, 60). We hypothesize that this pathway may 
compensate for lack of malic enzyme activity to produce pyruvate and additionally 
synthesize succinate without the carbon losses associated with isocitrate dehydrogen­
ase or alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase. For instance, the branched-chain alpha-keto 
acid dehydrogenase complex decarboxylates 2-oxobutanoate (with carbon ultimately 
derived from oxaloacetate) to form propionyl-CoA, producing CO 2 and NADH reductant 
(Fig. 5; 61). Given that isoleucine and valine are synthesized from mitochondrial pyruvate 
and odd-chain fatty acids represent a minimal fraction of the fatty acid pool ( Fig. 1B), 
these sources are unlikely to drive substantial flux through the methylcitrate cycle. In 
the nutrient-limited environment of the macrophage phagosome, where oxaloacetate-
derived amino acids may be utilized toward gluconeogenesis during infection ( 9), the 
methylcitrate cycle may instead promote carbon conservation and reductant regenera­
tion, supporting Histoplasma pathogenesis.
Generating NADPH is essential for biosynthesis and is also one output of the 
mitochondrial malic enzyme, which appears minimally active in Histoplasma yeasts 
FIG 5 Summary schematic of metabolic pathways in Histoplasma. Arrows highlighted in orange 
represent reactions contributing to pyruvate production, in purple represent the methylcitrate cycle, in 
green represent the mannitol cycle, and in yellow represent reactions contributing to glycine production.

(Fig. 4 ). Since the methylcitrate cycle cannot compensate for this function of malic 
enzyme, NADPH biosynthesis may rely on the mannitol cycle, which consumes NADH 
for mannitol synthesis and its catabolism generates NADPH in a cyclical manner ( Fig. 
5; 62). Interestingly, mannitol reached isotopic steady state despite its vast pool size 
(Table S1) (10), unlike glutamate, which was diluted. This suggests that mannitol undergo 
active turnover rather than serve as a stagnant carbon pool, consistent with metabolic 
network principles ( 19). Thus, in the absence of malic enzyme for NADPH homeostasis, 
the mannitol cycle may serve a critical role in NADPH production in exchange for NADH 
in Histoplasma’s metabolism, as observed in other fungi (63–65).
Given the importance of mannitol in NADPH homeostasis to serving as a carbohy­
drate store and possibly detoxifying the phagosomal space of reactive oxygen species 
(10), disrupting these functions could lead to novel therapeutics. Nitrophenide has been 
reported as an inhibitor of mannitol metabolism in the filamentous fungus Neosartorya 
fischeri (66). While there are notable differences in morphotypes between Histoplasma 
and filamentous fungi and the compound remains uncharacterized in pathogenic yeasts, 
its potential as an inhibitor in Histoplasma warrants consideration. Further investigation 
is needed to assess its relevance and efficacy.
Dual pathways of serine biosynthesis in Histoplasma yeasts
Other alternative routes of carbon metabolism were also suggested by 13C-labeling flux 
analysis. Within yeasts labeled with 13C-glutamate (Fig. 3B), serine notably had an average 
labeling percent dissimilar to its direct precursor, 3-phosphoglycerate, while matching 
average labeling to pyruvate. However, the mass isotopomer distribution of serine 
differed significantly from that of pyruvate, with serine showing an abundance of M 
+ 1 and M + 2 isotopomers, while pyruvate was dominated by M + 3 isotopomers ( Table 
S2). These results indicate that serine is neither substantially deaminated to pyruvate nor 
reconverted into 3-phosphoglycerate (via reversible phosphorylated serine pathway), as 
such processes would have been reflected by similar isotopomer profiles. Instead, serine 
biosynthesis may proceed via an alternative pathway involving threonine aldolase, which 
generates glycine, followed by its reversible conversion of glycine into serine via glycine 
hydroxymethyltransferase ( Fig. 5 ; 38). Transcripts for these two enzymes have been 
detected in prior studies utilizing similar growth conditions (accession #: PRJNA1069744). 
These findings demonstrate that Histoplasma produces serine through two distinct, 
concurrently active metabolic pathways, rather than relying solely on synthesis from 
3-phosphoglycerate.
In conclusion, this study reveals the central carbon metabolism of pathogenic phase 
yeast cells of Histoplasma, providing new insights into its major carbon sinks, active 
metabolic reactions and pathways, and enzyme compartmentalization. This study also 
showcases the potential of fluxomics in analyzing the activity of enzymatic reactions 
and that active metabolic pathways cannot be assumed simply from genes encoding 
pathway enzymes or the mere availability of pathway substrates. To this end, compara­
tive MFA between strains, mutants, morphotypes, and other fungal pathogens offers a 
promising path forward for uncovering metabolism that facilitates pathogenesis.

(EDTA) (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), phenol and isoamyl alcohol (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific), ethanol (Decon Labs, Inc, King of Prussia, PA, USA), and sodium acetate 
(J. T. Baker, Inc, Phillipsburg, NJ, USA). Cell walls were extracted with acetone, ethyl 
acetate, and trifluoracetic acid (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and with acetic anhydride, 
ammonium hydroxide, pyridine, and sodium borohydride (MilliporeSigma). Metabo­
lites were compared to commercial standards (MilliporeSigma). Unlabeled carbon 
substrates, glucose (Research Products International) and glutamate (MilliporeSigma), 
were fed to yeasts. Stable isotopes, [1,2- 13C2]glucose, [U- 13C6]glucose, [U- 13C5]gluta­
mate, [U-13C6]mannose, [U-13C6]fructose, and [U- 13C2]glycine, were obtained (Cambridge 
Isotope Laboratories, Tewksbury, MA, USA). General solvents used for biomass extraction 
(chloroform, hydrochloric acid, and isopropanol) and/or mass spectrometry analyses 
(acetonitrile, hexane, and methanol) were also acquired (Thermo Fisher Scientific). 
Ultrapure water for biomass extractions and liquid chromatography-tandem mass 
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses was from a Milli-Q system (MilliporeSigma).
H. capsulatum strains and cultivation
The Histoplasma North American clade 2 ( H. ohiense) clinical isolate G217B (ATCC 26032) 
was maintained in Histoplasma-macrophage medium ( 67) with continuous shaking 
(200 rpm at 37°C). For experiments in defined media, 3M medium with 80 mM glucose 
and 30 mM glutamate was inoculated at 5 million yeast/mL. The same media was 
also incubated without yeasts to control for evaporation. After 67 h of incubation, 
cultures were aliquoted to 250 million cells per tube, washed once with cold water, 
and devitalized in 500 µL of 60% methanol before freezing at −80°C.
Biomass extraction and quantification
Samples were received at the University of North Texas, speed-vacuumed (30°C for 1 h), 
flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and lyophilized ( −80°C for 3 days). Multiple extractions, 
each with five biological replicates, were performed to quantify fatty acids, glycogen, 
proteins, mannitol, and cell wall components from freeze-dried yeasts, while nucleic 
acids were extracted from live yeasts at The Ohio State University.
Fatty acids were extracted using methyl tert-butyl ether as described ( 68), and 50 µL 
of 1 mg/mL TG-C19:0 was added prior to homogenization as an internal standard 
(TG-C19:0 was below the limit of detection in the analysis of fatty acid methyl esters from 
Histoplasma [data not shown]). Fatty acid methyl ester quantification was performed 
using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) ( 69) with an Agilent 6890N gas 
chromatograph coupled to an Agilent 5975B mass selective detector (Santa Clara, CA) 
and an Omegawax 250 capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 µm; MilliporeSigma). 
Data acquisition and integration were performed as previously described with modifica-
tions: the initial oven temperature was 80°C and held for 0.5 min, followed by an increase 
to 245°C for 7.5 min at a rate of 25°C min−1 (70).
Protein and glycogen were sequentially extracted according to a hexane/isopropanol 
phase extraction method ( 71). Following lipid removal, the extracted protein underwent 
acid hydrolysis, and the resulting amino acids were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Samples 
were analyzed using an Agilent 1290 Infinity II HPLC (Santa Clara, CA, USA) coupled to 
an ABSciex QTRAP6500+ mass spectrometer system (Framingham, MA, USA) following 
the described protocol ( 37). Hydrolyzed protein extract was resuspended in 0.5 mL 
hydrochloric acid (0.01 N) and then diluted 1:250 in 1 mM hydrochloric acid. Four 
microliters of diluted sample was injected onto the column. Total crude protein content 
was determined using a FlashSmart Elemental Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 
through the Dumas combustion method at the Quantitative Bio-Element Analysis and 
Mapping Center at Michigan State University. Percent nitrogen was multiplied by the 
nitrogen-to-protein conversion factor, 6.25, to yield total crude protein ( 29). Glycogen 
was subsequently extracted by autoclaving in the presence of α-amyloglucosidase to 
release glucosyl units and quantified as described (72).

Mannitol was extracted and purified according to a boiling water extraction ( 16, 73–
75). Two-hundred nanomoles of [U- 13C6]mannose was added at the time of extraction 
as an internal standard. Lyophilized extracts were resuspended in 500 mL of ultrapure 
water, transferred to 0.2 µm NANOSEP microfilter tubes (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and 
centrifuged (17,000 × g at 4°C for 10 min). Purified extracts were diluted 1:500 in 
acetonitrile/water (70:30; vol/vol), and 2 mL was injected onto the column for LC-MS/MS 
analysis. Mannitol was quantified as reported (10).
For nucleic acids, 250 million yeasts were collected by centrifugation (2,000 × g for 
2 min) and resuspended in 200 mL of lysis buffer (2% Triton X-100, 200 mM NaCl, 20 mM 
Tris, pH 8.0, and 2 mM EDTA). Approximately 100 µL of glass beads (0.5 µm diameter) 
and 200 µL of phenol:CHCl 3:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) were added to the resuspension 
and agitated for 2 min. Lysate was clarified by centrifugation (14,000 × g for 10 min), 
and the aqueous (upper) nucleic acid-containing phase was diluted 1:4 in water. The 
nucleic acids were precipitated by adding 1/10 vol of 3M sodium acetate pH 5.2 and an 
equal volume of isopropanol for 5 min. The precipitated nucleic acids were collected by 
centrifugation (14,000 × g for 10 min), washed with 70% ethanol, resuspended in 50 mL 
TE (10 mM Tris, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA), and quantified by absorbance at 260 nm (WPA 
Biowave Spectrophotometer, Biochrom Ltd., Cambridge, England).
The monosaccharide composition of Histoplasma’s cell wall was determined as 
previously detailed through weak acid hydrolysis (2M trifluoroacetic acid), alditol acetate 
derivatization of extracts (requiring 10 mg/mL sodium borohydride in 1 M ammonium 
hydroxide, acetic anhydride, and pyridine), and GC-MS quantification of hemicellulose 
components (76). Amino sugars (chitin) were not compatible with the extraction and/or 
derivatization.
Media consumption
Media consumption was assessed by detecting the remaining amount of substrates 
after incubation for 67 h. Four uninoculated media were incubated alongside four 
inoculated media to control for evaporation. Following incubation, 1 mL was collected 
from the inoculated or uninoculated media, and yeasts were removed by centrifuga­
tion (2,000 × g for 2 min) and filtered using Choice PVDF (Hydrophilic) Syringe Filters 
(Invitrogen). Ten microliters of media was diluted 1:100 with ultrapure water and 1 µmol 
of [U- 13C6]fructose and [U- 13C2]glycine were added as internal standards. Samples were 
cleaned using 0.2 µm NANOSEP microfiltering devices and quantified by LC-MS/MS as 
previously described ( 69, 71). Glucose and glutamate consumptions were determined 
by the difference between the substrate concentrations of uninoculated and inoculated 
media.
Total carbon uptake and CCE were calculated as described ( 35), where CCE is defined 
as the percentage of biomass accumulation versus total carbon uptake. To account for 
differences in the growth rates of the cultures, the average DW of aliquoted 250 million 
yeast samples was correlated to the inoculum (representing initial biomass) and final 
cell count (representing final biomass) to estimate biomass accumulation. The same 
calculation was applied to determine substrate consumption for the entire culture’s cell 
mass.
Biomass rate calculation
Vwall, Vfas2, Vmaneff, Vpyrim, and Vpurine, defined in Table 1, were calculated from their 
respective biomass accumulation values (mg) using their monomer molecular weights 
minus the molecular weight from bonds involved in polymer formation and divided by 
incubation time and DW. Vfas2 was further determined by multiplying each fatty acid 
species (in nmol) by its respective number of acetyl-CoA monomers and summing their 
products. Calculation of the singular propionyl-CoA unit for odd-chain fatty acids was 
counted as 1.5 acetyl-CoA units. For Vfas1, Vfas2 was divided by three to account for the 
three fatty acids esterified to a single glycerol backbone in triacylglycerols and divided 
by the weighted average number of acetyl-CoA monomers per fatty acid species. For

proteinogenic amino acid fluxes, individual amino acid weight was calculated from the 
total crude protein content to their individual percentage in the proteinogenic amino 
acid distribution. Then, weight was converted to nmol using the respective molecular 
weights for each amino acid minus peptide bond weight.
Metabolite extraction and analyses
Water-soluble metabolites (sugars, sugar alcohols, amino acids, organic acids, and 
phosphorylated compounds) were extracted using boiling water from five biological 
replicates (four replicates for condition b), each containing 20 million yeasts, for each 
labeling condition: (i) unlabeled substrates, (ii) 20% [U- 13C6]glucose + 20% [U- 13C5]gluta­
mate, (iii) 80% [1,2- 13C2]glucose + 20% [U- 13C6]glucose, and (iv) 100% [U- 13C5]glutamate. 
LC-MS/MS analysis using multiple reaction monitoring was conducted on the different 
classes of metabolites and their respective mass isotopomer distributions as collectively 
reported (35).
Calculating free fluxes
To estimate metabolic fluxes, a model of central metabolism was built and provided with 
the rates of substrate uptake in nmol h −1 mg DW −1 for glucose (Vglcup) and glutamate 
(Vgluup). Biomass fluxes were quantified according to the rate of DW and biomass 
accumulation for cell wall synthesis (Vwall), glycerol incorporation into triacylglycerols 
(Vfas1), fatty acid synthesis (Vfas2), mannitol synthesis (Vmaneff), synthesis of pyrimi­
dines (Vpyrim), synthesis of purines (Vpurine), and synthesis of proteinogenic amino 
acids, with data from Fig. 1A through C . The label inputs consisting of either a mix­
ture of 20% [U- 13C6]glucose + 80% [1,2- 13C2]glucose or 100% [U- 13C5]glutamate and 
data from the parallel labeling experiments ( Table S2) were also provided. The natural 
abundance of 13C was accounted for within INCA, and 0.5% was added to all isotopo­
logue standard deviation percentages to avoid overfitting low-abundance isotopologues 
during flux estimation ( 77). Symmetrical mapping of atoms was included for fumarate, 
mannitol, succinate, and triose phosphates. Source fluxes (Vglcup and Vgluup) and sink 
fluxes toward biomass component accumulation (Vwall, Vfas1, Vfas2, Vmaneff, Vpyrim, 
and Vpurine) were included as experimental measurements in the model, with their 
respective standard deviations being used for flux estimation. Proteinogenic amino acid 
fluxes were constrained to their experimental average values. All other fluxes were 
estimated using the Levenberg-Marquardt optimization algorithm ( 78) by minimizing 
the variance-weighted sum of squared residuals between experimentally measured and 
simulated mass isotopomer distributions of intracellular metabolites. The 13C-enrichment 
data from experiments using 13C-glucose and 13C-glutamate were run simultaneously by 
selecting the “Run in parallel” function, and flux estimation was repeated 100 times from 
random initial values to ensure a global best fit. Monte Carlo analysis was employed to 
calculate the 95% confidence intervals for fitted fluxes, with 100 trials per iteration and 
an infinite number of trials possible. The relative error tolerance was set at 0.05.
