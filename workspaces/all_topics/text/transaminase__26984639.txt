Asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginines (ADMA and SDMA) impair nitric oxide bioavailability 
and have been implicated in the pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation (AF). Alanine–glyoxylate 
aminotransferase 2 (AGXT2) is the only enzyme capable of metabolizing both of the dimethylarginines. 
We hypothesized that two functional AGXT2 missense variants (rs37369, V140I; rs16899974, V498L) 
are associated with AF and its cardioembolic complications. Association analyses were conducted 
using 1,834 individulas with AF and 7,159 unaffected individuals from two coronary angiography 
cohorts and a cohort comprising patients undergoing clinical exercise testing. In coronary angiography 
patients without structural heart disease, the minor A allele of rs16899974 was associated with any 
AF (OR = 2.07, 95% CI 1.59-2.68), and with paroxysmal AF (OR = 1.98, 95% CI 1.44–2.74) and chronic 
AF (OR = 2.03, 95% CI 1.35–3.06) separately. We could not replicate the association with AF in the 
other two cohorts. However, the A allele of rs16899974 was nominally associated with ischemic stroke 
risk in the meta-analysis of WTCCC2 ischemic stroke cohorts (3,548 cases, 5,972 controls) and with 
earlier onset of first-ever ischemic stroke (360 cases) in the cohort of clinical exercise test patients. 
In conclusion, AGXT2 variations may be involved in the pathogenesis of AF and its age-related 
thromboembolic complications.
Circulating asymmetric and symmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA and SDMA) predict mortality in cardiovascu-
lar diseases

pathogenesis of atrial fibrillation (AF)3–7, whereas little attention has been paid to the role of SDMA2. In patients

with a history of AF , the induction of AF during catheter ablation resulted in significantly elevated ADMA levels 
in the atria and systemic circulation7, whereas in another study electrical cardioversion of AF decreased ADMA 
levels to normal values within 24 hours after AF was terminated6. Similarly, higher ADMA levels were associated 
with the recurrence of AF after electrical cardioversion or catheter ablation in patients with persistent AF 3,5. 
These data suggests that elevated ADMA levels are not only a consequence of AF but may also be involved in the 
development of AF by modifying the atrial substrates for AF . Indeed, although only ADMA directly inhibits nitric 
oxide synthase (NOS), both dimethylarginines can reduce the bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) by sifting the 
NOS enzyme from the production of NO to superoxide anion
8–10, and thus promote oxidative stress, endothelial 
dysfunction, and inflammation, all of which are associated with atrial remodelling and increased vulnerability 
to AF
11–13.
The primary pathway of ADMA deactivation is catalysed by the dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 
(DDAH) enzymes, whereas the renal clearance plays a major role in the elimination of SDMA from the sys-
temic circulation. In contrast to DDAH, alanine–glyoxylate aminotransferase 2 (AGXT2), a nuclear-encoded 
mitochondrial protein, can metabolise not only ADMA but also SDMA in humans
14,15. In addition to a strong 
expression of AGXT2 in the kidney and liver, AGXT2 mRNA expression was recently detected in several other 
human organs including the heart16. As the activity of DDAH is reduced and the generation of ADMA increased 
via up-regulation of protein arginine methyltransferase 1 (PRMT1) in animal fibrillating atria4 also explaining the 
increased ADMA levels in human AF , it can be hypothesized that the alternative AGXT2-mediated elimination 
pathway of dimethylarginines could play an important role in the pathogenesis of AF .
We recently fine-mapped the AGXT2 gene region on chromosome 5p13 for associations between 
single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and serum SDMA levels and identified two missense mutations in 
AGXT2 (rs37369, p.V140I; rs16899974, p.V498L) to be strongly and independently associated with SDMA levels 
in a meta-analysis of two large cohorts of European descent
15. Experimental data indicates that rs37369 modifies 
the enzyme activity16,17 whereas an in silico analysis showed that the rs16899974 variant may modify the enzyme 
stability17. Therefore, we considered that the two functional AGXT2 variants may serve as naturally occurring 
genetic models to study the role of AGXT2 in human AF and its thromboembolic complications, i.e. stroke and 
its subtypes. More specifically, we hypothesized that these functional variants are (1) associated with paroxysmal 
and/or chronic AF in patients referred for coronary angiography, (2) associated more strongly with circulating 
levels of ADMA and SDMA in patients with AF compared to patients in sinus rhythm, and (3) associated with 
ischemic stroke and its subtypes. As a genetic control, we repeated some of the analyses with a known variant at 
4q25 previously associated with AF .
Results
Associations of AGXT2  and 4q25 control variants with atrial fibrillation and its subtypes in 
patients referred for coronary angiography (LURIC and Corogene). The clinical characteristics of 
the study participants for all studies are shown in Supplementary Table 1. In LURIC, 381 (13.0%) patients had 
prevalent AF at baseline of which 175 (50.3%) and 173 (49.7%) were further classified as paroxysmal or chronic 
AF , respectively. Those with AF were older (mean age 66.4 versus 62.2 years, P <  0.0001) and had less likely cor-
onary artery disease (56.8% versus 71.6%, P <  0.0001) than patients in sinus rhythm. The associations of AGXT2 
and 4q25 variants with AF and its subtypes are shown in Fig. 1. In the whole study population, rs16899974 
showed a significant association with any AF (P =  6.6 ×  10
−4) in a fully adjusted model. Moreover, when ana-
lysing paroxysmal and chronic AF cases separately, the association was especially marked with the paroxysmal 
subtype (P =  1.8 ×  10
−4), whereas there was no association with chronic AF (P =  0.53). We found strong evidence 
that a history of valvular heart disease attenuated the effect of rs16899974 and rs37369 on AF (p for interac-
tion of 4.3 ×  10
−4 and 0.015, respectively, Table 1). Nominally significant interaction was also observed between 
rs16899974 and prevalent cardiomyopathy on AF (P =  0.043). When excluding the patients with structural heart

disease from the analysis, a highly significant association for AGXT2  rs16899974 was observed with any AF 
(P =  3.9 ×  10−8), and with paroxysmal AF (P =  3.0 ×  10−5) and chronic AF (P =  7.0 ×  10−4) separately. In con-
trast to the AGXT2 SNPs, the 4q25 variant showed a stronger association with chronic AF than paroxysmal AF 
in both the whole study population and when excluding the patients with structural heart disease (Fig. 1). When 
conducting a genome-wide scan using the fully adjusted model in patients without structural heart disease, no 
additional genome-wide significant associations were identified apart from the signal at the AGXT2 locus (data 
not shown).
We sought to replicate the associations of the AGXT2 variants with AF and its subtypes in an independent 
cohort. In contrast to LURIC, all subjects in the Corogene study with genotype data available had an acute coro-
nary syndrome (Supplementary Table 1). Of the 2,208 patients included in the analysis, 265 (12.0%) had preva-
lent AF of which 141 (6.4%) and 107 (4.8%) had paroxysmal and chronic AF , respectively. No associations were 
observed between AGXT2  variants and AF or its subtypes in Corogene (all P >  0.05, Supplementary Table 2).  
However, in accordance with the associations seen in LURIC, the 4q25 variant showed significant associations 
with any AF (OR =  1.50, 95% CI 1.18–1.91, P =  0.001) and chronic AF (OR =  1.84, 95% CI 1.29–2.61, P =  0.001) 
but not with paroxysmal AF (OR =  1.25, 95% CI 0.89–1.74, P =  0.20).
Associations with incident clinical AF and age at AF onset (FINCAVAS). Of the 3,862 FINCAV AS 
patients undergoing clinical exercise test between 2001 and 2008, 1,188 (30.8%) had their first AF event diag-
nosed between 1987 and 2015. The mean (SD) age at the diagnosis was 60.5 (13.3) and 64.6 (13.7) years for men 
and women, respectively (Supplementary Figure 1). The AF-free survival curves stratified by the rs16899974 gen-
otypes for all patients and AF cases only are displayed in Fig. 2A,B, and for the AGXT2 rs37369 and 4q25 variants 
in Supplementary Figures 2 and 3. No associations were seen between the rs16899974 genotypes and incident 
AF either in the whole study population or in the case-only-analysis (both P >  0.05). As seen in Fig. 2A,B, the 
survival curves of the three genotype groups start to separate only after around age 75, suggesting that other 
factors are responsible for clinical AF events in younger patients. In a multivariable analysis, rs16899974 was 
associated with incident AF and age at AF diagnosis in patients aged ≥ 75 years at the end of the follow-up, but 
not in patients aged < 75 years at censoring of data (Table 2, Supplementary Table 3). The 4q25 variant showed 
a strong association in the whole study population; however, rs16899974 appears to be more strongly associated 
with incident AF in patients aged ≥ 75 years.
Associations with history of ischemic stroke and its subtypes (WTCCC2). We examined whether 
the two functional AGXT2 variants are associated with ischemic stroke and its subtypes in the meta-analysis of 
WTCCC2 ischemic stroke cohorts. As shown in Supplementary Table 4, there was no significant association of 
rs37369 with all-cause ischemic stroke (IS) whereas rs16899974 showed statistically significant associations with 
all-cause IS and large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA) stroke subtype with per A allele ORs of 1.04 (95% CI 1.00–
1.08, P =  0.032) and 1.10 (95% CI 1.01–1.19, P =  0.021), respectively. Moreover, rs16899974 showed a borderline 
significant association in the same direction for cardioembolic (CE) stroke with an OR of 1.08 (95% CI 1.00–1.16, 
P =  0.057). The SNPs were not associated with small-vessel disease (SVD) stroke subtype.

68.5 (12.4) years for men and women, respectively. Of the 360 incident ischemic stroke cases, 83 (23%) had a 
previous AF diagnosis. The ischemic stroke-free survival curves stratified by the rs16899974 genotypes for all 
patients and ischemic stroke cases only are displayed in Fig. 2C,D, and for the AGXT2 rs37369 and 4q25 variants 
in Supplementary Figures 2 and 3. None of the three SNPs showed a statistically significant association with 
incident ischemic stroke. However, rs16899974 was associated with age at onset of a first ischemic stroke both 
in the univariate analysis (Fig. 2D) and after controlling for sex and previously diagnosed clinical AF (Table 3). 
Interestingly, this finding was seen only in patients with cryptogenic ischemic stroke (n =  233) with a per minor 
allele HR of 1.57 (95% CI 1.21–2.04, P =  0.0007) and approximately 3.8 (95% CI 1.5–6.0, P =  0.0009) years ear-
lier age at the diagnosis with each additional copy of the minor allele but not in those with another diagnosis of 
ischemic stroke (n =  127, both P >  0.05).
Associations with circulating dimethylarginines in patients with sinus rhythm and AF (LURIC).  
As displayed in Fig. 3A, there were statistically significant stepwise increases of ADMA and SDMA levels in 
patients with paroxysmal AF and chronic AF compared to patients in sinus rhythm. The trend across the AF sta-
tus groups for ADMA remained highly significant after adjusting for age, sex and estimated glomerular filtration 
rate (eGFR) (p for linear trend =  1.9 ×  10
−9) whereas the association with SDMA was attenuated, but still signif-
icant (p for linear trend =  0.0023). The unadjusted associations of the AGXT2 variants with ADMA, SDMA and 
eGFR by AF status are shown in Fig. 3B. As we expected, both SNPs showed strong associations with circulating 
SDMA levels in patients with sinus rhythm. Neither of the AGXT2 variants was associated with ADMA or eGFR 
in any of the AF status groups; however, rs16899974 showed a borderline significant association with ADMA in 
patients with paroxysmal AF (P =  0.057). Moreover, it seems that the effect estimates for SDMA in the paroxys-
mal AF group are larger than in those with no AF or chronic AF (Fig. 3B). To test this hypothesis the interaction 
between the AF status groups and the AGXT2 genotypes on SDMA levels were tested using a two-way ANOV A 
model with interaction. Statistically significant interaction was observed for rs16899974 in unadjusted model 
(F =  3.8, P =  0.0044), and when age, sex and eGFR were used as covariates (F =  2.6, P =  0.036). No such statisti-
cally significant interactions were observed for rs37369 or when using ADMA as a dependent variable.
Discussion
In the present study, we analysed the presence of associations of two functional missense AGXT2 variants with 
AF and its thromboembolic complications in four independent study cohorts. The p.V498L variant (rs16899974) 
was associated with an increased risk of both paroxysmal and chronic AF in patients referred for coronary angi-
ography but with no structural heart disease. Moreover, the same A allele of rs16899974 was nominally associated 
with an increased risk of any ischemic stroke in the meta-analysis of WTCCC2 ischemic stroke cohorts. Finally, 
rs16899974 was associated with an earlier age at the first ischemic stroke diagnosis in patients undergoing exer-
cise stress testing and with incident clinical AF in patients aged ≥ 75 years at the time of AF diagnosis in the same 
cohort.
The two studied AGXT2 SNPs have not been identified to be associated at a genome-wide significant level 
with the risk of prevalent or incident AF
18 or ischemic stroke subtypes19 in previous large scale meta-analyses of 
genome-wide association studies. This is in accordance with the data from the FINCAV AS study showing lack 
of association with incident AF and ischemic stroke in the whole study population. Furthermore, no associa-
tions were observed with prevalent AF or its subtypes in the Corogene study including coronary angiography 
patients with acute coronary syndrome. In striking contrast with these findings we found a genome-wide signifi-
cant association of rs16899974 with any AF in patients without structural heart disease in the LURIC study. This

discharge data based incident clinical AF in patients aged 75 and over at the time of AF diagnosis. Although, there 
is a separate meta-analysis for lone AF
20, defined as AF with an onset before 66 years of age in individuals without 
overt heart disease, no large-scale studies have sought to identify common genetic variants underlying AF risk in 
the elderly or for paroxysmal and more persistent forms of AF separately.
Interestingly, rs6817105 at 4q25, previously associated with AF in genome-wide association studies, was 
mainly associated with prevalent chronic AF in both LURIC and Corogene. These associations suggest that the 
risk allele carriers have a relatively high rate of progression from paroxysmal AF to chronic AF , at least in patients 
referred for coronary angiography. In contrast, the associations of rs16899974 with both paroxysmal and chronic 
AF in LURIC, with late onset clinical AF and with earlier age of onset of cryptogenic ischemic stroke suggest a 
role for AGXT2 in more subclinical forms of AF characterized by a relatively low rate of progression to chronic 
AF; however, this hypothesis needs to be validated in a prospective setting.
In line with the AF associations in LURIC and FINCAV AS, the AF risk allele of rs16899974 was associated 
with an earlier onset of cryptogenic ischemic stroke although no association was observed with the ischemic 
stroke risk in the whole FINCAV AS study population. The association with age at ischemic stroke diagnosis was 
strengthened after adjusting the analysis for gender and prior AF diagnosis. Moreover, the majority of ischemic 
stroke cases did not have a prior AF diagnosis and were not having an oral anticoagulation therapy against cardi-
oembolic stroke. The association with the age at ischemic stroke diagnosis could be explained with the observed 
associations with paroxysmal AF in LURIC and AF in patients aged 75 and over in FINCAV AS. Paroxysmal AF 
is more likely to be subclinical and asymptomatic than more persistent forms of AF and therefore acute ischemic 
stroke may be the first clinical manifestation of the underlying subclinical atrial fibrillation. The possible bias due 
to the underdiagnosed paroxysmal AF cases in FINCAV AS may explain the observation that the association with 
incident AF is seen only in the elderly with probably more symptoms and more frequent screening for AF than 
younger patients.
In the LURIC study, circulating ADMA and SDMA levels showed step-wise increases as the AF status was 
changed from sinus rhythm through paroxysmal and chronic AF independent of age, sex and renal function. In 
line with these results, a similar step-wise increase in ADMA levels were seen in patients with paroxysmal AF 
and non-paroxysmal AF compared to patients with no AF in a previous study of coronary angiography patients 
whereas the association of SDMA with AF was not investigated
21. More recently, ADMA, but not SDMA, was 
independently associated with the development of symptomatic AF in patients with acute myocardial infarc-
tion
22. In contrast, SDMA, but not ADMA, was significantly associated with atrial fibrillation in patients with 
acute ischemic stroke2. The lack of association between SDMA and AF in most of the previous studies may reflect 
the relatively small number of AF cases studied. Moreover, the method of ADMA and SDMA quantification is not 
standardized complicating comparisons between different studies.
We observed a statistically significant interaction between rs16899974 and AF status groups on circulating 
SDMA levels independent of age, sex and renal function. Together with the observation that AGXT2 is expressed 
in the human heart
16 this interaction suggests a possible role for AGXT2 in the local dimethylarginine metabolism

in cardiac tissue; however, due to the observational nature of our study, this interesting hypothesis clearly needs 
further investigation. Furthermore, the lack of association of rs16899974 with the systemic ADMA levels does not 
exclude the possibility that AGXT2 could contribute to the ADMA metabolism locally in cardiac tissues. This can 
be explained by the fact that, unlike SDMA, ADMA is primarily metabolised by the DDAH enzymes which may 
be able to compensate impaired metabolism by AGXT2 both locally and at the systemic level
23.
To further support the role of dimethylarginines behind the associations with AF , in a recent large 
population-based study 24, SDMA was correlated with markers of atrial remodelling such as left atrial size and 
atrial conductance time although no independent association was seen between SDMA and AF . These asso-
ciations are in line with the concept that dimethylarginines could promote the electrical and structural atrial 
remodeling during AF secondary to oxidative stress and NO synthase uncoupling. It is also possible that the 
genetic variants of AGXT2 within cardiac tissues alter the NO-related signalling pathways that regulate almost all 
cardiac ionic channels and modulate the susceptibility to both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias
25. Interestingly, 
a recent report showed that ADMA was independently associated with left atrial appendage thrombus in patients 
with non-valvular atrial fibrillation26, further supporting the concept that ADMA-induced endocardial dysfunc-
tion could contribute to the increased risk of cardioembolic stroke in AF . Finally, because the AGXT2 enzyme 
have several substrates other than dimethylarginines
27 and the systemic levels of dimethylarginines can merely 
reflect the systemic and/or local activity of AGXT2, our results support further mechanistic studies on the role of 
dimethylarginines behind the observed associations.
Whether future genome-wide association studies on age at onset of any ischemic or cryptogenic stroke could 
identify novel genetic variants associated additionally with paroxysmal or subclinical forms of AF is worth inves-
tigating because diagnosing of silent AF is challenging. Moreover, as the risk of AF increases substantially with 
age, an age-at-onset informed
28 or age stratification-based29 approaches could detect novel AF loci whose magni-
tude of genetic effects differ with age. Whether the AGXT2 variants could predict the presence of a silent or parox-
ysmal AF in patients with acute cryptogenic ischemic stroke warrants further investigation. Finally, experimental 
data for the functional role of rs16899974 is currently lacking.
Some degree of misclassification of AF cases is expected, although this would most likely attenuate the true 
genetic effect rather than create false positive findings. Because atrial fibrillation is often intermittent and asymp-
tomatic, it is not possible to exclude the possibility that some of those how are classified to have no AF have unde-
tected silent AF . However, this limitation is likely to be present in all clinical data sets in which AF is defined based 
on hospital discharge diagnostic codes rather than prolonged ambulatory ECG monitoring. In contrast, acute 
ischemic stroke with neurologic deficits is less likely to be left undetected and without a diagnosis. Moreover, the 
associations with AF and age at ischemic stroke onset cannot be directly generalized to the general population, 
other patient groups or individuals of other ancestral backgrounds. Finally, rs16899974 may be in linkage disequi-
librium with the causal variant(s) underlying the associations with AF and ischemic stroke phenotypes.
Conclusions
We found strong evidence that the AGXT2 p.V498L polymorphism is associated with both paroxysmal and 
chronic forms of AF in coronary angiographic patients without structural heart disease in ultrasound, and ear -
lier age at onset of ischemic stroke in patients undergoing exercise stress testing. Hence, our study suggests that 
AGXT2 variations are involved in the genesis of AF and its age-related thromboembolic complications. Future 
mechanistic studies should investigate whether these associations are mediated through local metabolism of 
dimethylarginines by AGXT2 in cardiac tissues.
Methods
Study populations. The LURIC study consists of 3,316 Caucasian patients hospitalized for coronary angi-
ography between 1997 and 2000 at a tertiary care center in Southwestern Germany. Clinical indications for angi-
ography were chest pain or a positive non-invasive stress test suggestive of myocardial ischemia. To limit clinical 
heterogeneity, individuals suffering from acute illnesses other than acute coronary syndrome (ACS), chronic 
non-cardiac diseases and a history of malignancy within the five past years were excluded.
The Corogene study included 5295 consecutive Finnish patients assigned to coronary angiogram in 4 hospi-
tals servicing 1.5 million people in the Hospital District of Helsinki and Uusimaa. Of the Corogene study, 2500 
patients with acute coronary syndrome (ICD-10: I20–I25) were included in a genome-wide association study.
The FINCAV AS study included all consecutive patients referred for a clinically indicated exercise test using 
a bicycle ergometer at Tampere University Hospital between October 2001 and the end of 2008 and willing to 
participate. A total of 4,068 participants had a technically successful exercise test. The main indications for the 
exercise test were suspicion of coronary heart disease (CHD, frequency 46%), evaluation of work capacity (26%), 
testing vulnerability to arrhythmia during exercise (25%), and adequacy of the CHD treatment (13%); some 
patients had more than one indication.
Discovery stroke cohorts in WTCCC2 ischemic stroke GW AS included samples from the UK and Germany, 
with a total of 3,548 cases and 5,972 controls. See further description of the study cohorts and laboratory analyses 
in Supplementary Methods 1–2 and Supplementary Tables 1, 5 and 6.
This study was conducted according to the Declaration of Helsinki principles and written informed consent 
was obtained from all participants. The study was performed in accordance with approved guidelines and reg -
ulations. The LURIC study was approved by the ethics committee at the Ärztekammer Rheinland-Pfalz. The 
Corogene study was approved by appropriate Ethics Committees of the Helsinki and Uusimaa Hospital region. 
The FINCAV AS study was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Hospital District of Pirkanmaa, Finland. 
For the WTCCC2 ischemic stroke cohorts, the recruitment of patients was approved by the relevant local ethics 
committees from all the participating centers.

Genotyping and quality control. In LURIC, genotyping was done by using the Affymetrix Human SNP 
Array 6.0 at the LURIC Study facility. Genotype imputation was performed using the IMPUTE2 software and the 
1000 Genomes March 2012 haplotypes as a reference. Genotyped data was used for rs37369 and imputed data for 
rs16899974 with an excellent imputation quality (info~0.935).
The Corogene cohort was genotyped with Illumina 660 K BeadChip array at the Sanger Institute (Hixton, 
Cambridge, UK) and imputed using the 1000 Genomes April 2012 reference panel as a reference.
In FINCAV AS, we genotyped rs16899974 successfully for 3,889 participants using Taqman@SNP Genotyping 
Assay C__25742181_10 and ABI Prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, 
CA, USA). No evidence for deviation from the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium was observed (
χ1
2 =  0.21, p =  0.65). 
The data for rs37369 and rs6817105 were obtained for 3,195 individuals by genotyping using the Illumina 
HumanCardio-Metabo BeadChip or HumanCoreExome chip arrays and imputation using the IMPUTE2 soft-
ware and 1000 Genomes March 2012 haplotypes as a reference.
For the WTCCC2 samples, Illumina BeadChips were used for genome-wide genotyping and genotype impu-
tation was performed using MACH based on HapMap Phase 2 European (CEU) reference data.
Classification of atrial fibrillation cases. In LURIC, 2,923 patients had both genotype and atrial fibril-
lation (AF) status data available. Of the 2,923 participants, 360 had a history of AF at baseline. In addition, 161 
individuals were in AF rhythm during the index coronary angiography, of which 21 were not included in the 360 
cases diagnosed previously. Therefore, a total of 381 individuals were classified as any AF . Of the 381 AF cases, 348 
were further classified as having either paroxysmal AF (n =  175) or chronic AF (n= 173).
For the Corogene study, potential prevalent AF cases were screened from the baseline database. For these 
patients, we ascertained the AF status and its subtype from their medical records. Of the 2,208 patients included 
in this study, 265, 141 and 107 had any AF , paroxysmal AF and chronic AF , respectively.
For the FINCAV AS participants, clinical AF was ascertained from the central university hospital discharge 
diagnostic codes (ICD-9-CM 427.3, 427.31, or 427.32; or ICD-10 I48) from 1987 to 2015 (1179 incident AF 
cases), and study population area-wide electrical ECG recordings from 2005 onward (16 additional incident AF 
cases). In addition, to further ascertain the AF status at the index exercise stress test, we utilized the data from 
the baseline examination. According to the FINCAV AS baseline database, 13 patients had a history of AF/flutter 
or developed one during the exercise stress test but did not have any previous discharge diagnosis of AF with 
the date of diagnosis and were therefore excluded from all analyses. Both the genotype and phenotype data were 
available for 1,188 incident AF cases and 2,674 censored controls.
Classification of ischemic stroke cases. For the WTCCC2 ischemic stroke cohorts, Trial of Org 10172 
in Acute Stroke Treatment (TOAST) classification 30 was performed by an in-house neurologist and all stroke 
cases were classified into mutually exclusive aetiologic subtypes: large-artery atherosclerosis (LAA), small-vessel 
disease (SVD), cardioembolic stroke (CE), other aetiology, or unknown aetiology.
For the FINCAV AS cohort, age at the first ischemic stroke was ascertained from the central university hos-
pital discharge diagnostic codes (ICD-9 433.x1, 434 (excluding 434.x0), or 436; or ICD-10 I63.0–I63.9). Of the 
3,862 individuals with both genotype and phenotype data available, there were 360 incident ischemic stroke cases 
diagnosed between 1987 and 2015. In the majority of the cases 233 (65%), the etiology (LAA, SVD or CE) was 
uncertain at the time of the diagnosis and were therefore diagnosed as a cryptogenic ischemic stroke (I63.9).
Statistical methods for cross-sectional association and interaction analyses. Statistical analyses 
were performed under the R statistical environment. The associations of the AGXT2 and 4q25 variants with 
AF and its subtypes were tested using multivariable logistic regression analyses assuming an additive genetic 
model. In addition, we tested the interactions of the studied polymorphisms with established AF risk factors 
on any AF in LURIC. For the WTCCC2 cohorts, associations of the AGXT2 variants were tested with unad-
justed logistic regression using PLINK
31 under an additive genetic model and results were meta-analyzed with 
inverse-variance-weighted method implemented in the METAL software32.
Statistical methods for survival and age of onset analyses. Survival analyses were used to assess 
associations with incident AF/stroke and differences in age of AF/stroke onset as a function of the studied var -
iants. In addition, for the age of onset analyses, we applied linear regression considering the age of onset as a 
quantitative trait. Survival curves of time to AF/stroke onset were estimated using the Kaplan–Meier method. 
We used a Cox regression analysis to examine the effect of the SNPs together with covariates on the survival 
functions of incident AF and ischemic stroke. We used chronological age as the fundamental time scale in all 
analyses. All patients were followed to a fixed date (April 2015). Those with no incident AF or ischemic stroke 
during the observation period were right censored at their last visit at the central hospital or at their last electrical 
ECG recording in the community, whichever came later. Significance was accepted at P <  0.05 in all analyses.
