Abstract 
Recombineering is an important tool in gene editing, enabling fast, precise and highly specific in vivo modification of microbial genomes. 
Oligonucleotide-mediated recombineering via the in vivo production of single-stranded DNA can overcome the limitations of traditional 
recombineering methods that rely on the exogenous delivery of editing templates. By modifying a previously reported plasmid-based 
system for fully in vivo single-stranded DNA recombineering, we demonstrate iterative editing of independent loci by utilizing a 
temperature-sensitive origin of replication for easy curing of the editing plasmid from recombinant cells. Optimization of the pro-
moters driving the expression of the system’s functional components, combined with targeted counterselection against unedited cells 
with Cas9 nuclease, enabled editing efficiencies of 90–100%. The addition of a dominant-negative mutL allele to the system allowed 
single-nucleotide edits that were otherwise unachievable due to mismatch repair. Finally, we tested alternative recombinases and 
found that efficiency significantly increased for some targets. Requiring only a single cloning step for retargeting, our system provides 
an easy-to-use method for rapid, efficient construction of desired mutants.

1. Introduction
Genome editing technologies have proven to be invaluable molec-
ular tools, enabling rapid advances in functional genomics, 
metabolic engineering, therapeutics development, bioremedia-
tion and more (1–4). Traditional methods for genome editing 
use allelic exchange via the RecA-dependent process of homol-
ogous recombination (HR). In HR, circular or linear DNA sub-
strates, encoding the desired modification flanked by targeted 
regions of homology, are introduced into recombination-proficient 
(
ΔrecBCΔsbcBC or ΔrecD) cells ( 5, 6). Endogenous recombination 
proteins facilitate crossover between the editing template and the 
target locus, incorporating the desired mutations into the host 
chromosome. While this process is useful for targeted mutage-
nesis, it is sometimes inefficient and always laborious, requiring 
numerous cloning steps to incorporate sizable regions of homol-
ogy (0.5–5 kb) and extensive screening to identify recombinant 
cells (7).
The development of in vivo recombination-mediated engineer-
ing (recombineering), which relies on phage-derived proteins to 
facilitate DNA integration, has greatly improved the speed and 
efficiency with which targeted mutations can be made. For exam-
ple, the λ
-phage-derived Red system in Escherichia coli yields more 
than a 100-fold increase in recombinant cells over traditional HR 
through a process independent of RecA ( 8, 9). Recombineering 
reduces editing template design constraints by enabling efficient 
recombination with homology arms of <50 bp on double-stranded 
DNA (10). In addition, short single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) oligonu-
cleotides (oligos) can be used as suitable recombineering sub-
strates. In fact, ssDNA oligos have produced recombinant cells 
with just one of the three λ-Red proteins, the ssDNA-annealing 
protein Beta, further simplifying the requirements for success-
ful recombineering ( 9). Furthermore, the Clustered Regularly 
Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR)–Cas9 bacterial 
immune system has been adapted as a programmable counter-
selection tool to selectively target and kill unedited cells after 
recombineering. This technique enhances the apparent efficiency 
by increasing the mutant to wild-type ratio of the population, 
allowing highly efficient scarless genome editing (11–14). Addi-
tional efforts for the improvement of λ-Red editing efficiency 
ha
ve used engineered mutator strains, where the overexpres-
sion of HR-involved enzymes, the deletion of host exonucle-
ases and/or disabling the mismatch repair system significantly 
improve recombination efficiency but can unintentionally lead to 
the accumulation of off-target mutations (15–17).
Farzadfard and Lu (18) described a novel approach for recom-
bineering, termed Synthetic Cellular Recorders Integrating Biolog-
ical Events (SCRIBE), where the ssDNA is generated in vivo and 
then incorporated into the chromosome. The in vivo ssDNA is pro-
duced by the Ec86 retron of E. coli BL21, composed of the msr 
and msd RNA elements and the reverse transcriptase (RT). Upon 
transcription of the msr–msd sequence, inverted repeats flanking 
the msr–msd RNA form a secondary structure specifically recog-
nized by the RT and the msdRNA is reverse transcribed to ssDNA. 
Simultaneous expression of bet on the SCRIBE plasmid allows 
for efficient recombination of the newly synthesized ssDNA into 
the lagging strand of the targeted locus during DNA replication 
(Figure 1A). By placing control of this system under an inducible 
pr
omoter, the cells record their exposure to the inducer as the frac-
tion of cells with the msd encoded mutation. By simply changing 
the msd sequence, SCRIBE can be easily retargeted to modify any 
desired genomic site. The authors report a maximum efficiency for 
SCRIBE of 10–4 recombinants per generation (18). While sufficient 
for making mutations conferring easily selectable phenotypes, 
this rate of recombination is not robust enough to obviate the need 
for extensive screening when making nonselectable edits (19).
Farzadfard et al. (20) improve upon their original SCRIBE design 
to 
achieve highly efficient ssDNA recombineering via transient 
knockdown of host exonuclease expression through CRISPR inter-
ference (CRISPRi), reporting nearly 100% recombination efficiency 
for one of their chosen targets. Additionally, the authors demon-
strate that SCRIBE enables the incorporation of multiple muta-
tions at distinct loci (18, 20). However, with no easy method 
for plasmid curing, doing so requires that each editing plasmid 
contain a unique selection marker for plasmid maintenance, a 
strategy limited by the number of orthogonal selection markers 
and compatible plasmid origins available.
In this work, we sought to enable iterative genome editing 
by moving the functional components to easily curable plas-
mids while maintaining the SCRIBE system’s high recombination 
efficiency. We hypothesized that combining an improved SCRIBE 
system with Cas9 counterselection against wild-type cells would 
provide an easy-to-use genome editing platform that precluded 
the need to electroporate ssDNA for recombineering. In addition, 
the system was designed so that the editing plasmid can be retar-
geted through a single round of PCR amplification and cloning 
to reduce construction times and enable the rapid generation of 
multilocus mutants.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Strains, plasmids and culture conditions
Bacterial strains used in this work are listed in Supplementary 
Table S1. Plasmid construction methods and primers are described 
in Supplementary Table S2  (along with Addgene #s for avail-
able plasmids) and the Primers_GeneFrags.fa file, respectively. The 
pFF745 plasmid was a gift from Timothy Lu (Addgene #61450). 
Cloning steps for retargeting the editing plasmid are illustrated in 
Supplementary Figure S2. Briefly, primers with overhangs encod-
ing the new target sequence were used to PCR amplify the vector 
using Q5 High-Fidelity 2x Master Mix (New England Biolabs, NEB), 
followed by DpnI digestion to remove template DNA, agarose gel 
electrophoresis to verify amplicon size and column-based DNA 
cleanup. DNA fragments were then assembled using the 2x NEB-
uilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (NEB) with the following 
modifications: 1 μl Master Mix + 0.5 μl each DNA fragment, incu-
bated 
at 50 ∘C for 15 min. Chemically competent E. coli NEB5α
cells were used for cloning. Antibiotics were used at the following 
concentrations unless otherwise noted: spectinomycin (50μg/ml), 
kanamycin (50 μ
g/ml), chloramphenicol (40 μg/ml), rifampicin 
(20 μg/ml), tetracycline (20 μg/ml) and carbenicillin (100 μ g/ml). 
The tetA gene was PCR amplified from pUC18-mini-Tn7T-Gm-
TetAR using primers 2490 and 2491 and integrated into E. coli
MG1655 using λ-Red recombination with pKD46 (21), creating the 
MG1655 yhiS::tetAR strain.
2.2 Recombineering assays and recombination 
efficiency determination
Since the number of recombinant cells should increase with 
time, all experiments were performed in freshly transformed cells. 
Approximately 100 ng of editing plasmid was transformed into 
competent E. coli cells via either heat shock at 42 ∘C or electropo-
ration in a 0.1-cm gap cuvette with a single 1.8-kV pulse. Cells 
were recovered in 1 ml SOB at 30 ∘C for 2 h and then outgrown 
overnight at 30 ∘C in 5 ml Luria Bertani (LB) broth + appropriate 
antibiotic(s) to select transformants. The total number of viable 
cells was determined by spotting 10 μl 10-fold serially diluted 
o
vernight cultures on LB plates+ appropriate antibiotic(s). For the 
rpoB and tetR assays, 10μL of 10-fold serially diluted overnight cul-
tur
es were spotted on LB plates with rifampicin or tetracycline to 
determine the number of recombinant cells. For the ackA assays, 
1 ml of cells from overnight cultures were pelleted, washed and 
resuspended with sterile phosphate buffered saline after which 
washed cells were spotted on M9 chloroacetate plates (M9 min-
imal media + 10 mM sodium chloroacetate + 2% glycerol + 0.1% 
SOB) to determine the number of ackA mutant cells. Recom-
bination efficiency was determined by dividing the number of 
recombinant cells by the total number of viable transformants. 
Efficiencies reported are the mean and standard error for three 
independent replicates. For the rpoB experiments, spontaneous 
rifampicin resistance was assessed for the wild-type strain as 
described in Section 2.6 below and the spontaneous mutation 
rate was subtracted from all samples plated on rifampicin. All 
statistical analyses were performed using the GraphPad Prism 5 
program.
2.3 Promoter optimization
The P lacO promoter of the Ec86 retron cassette in pTLlSc-rpoB 
was replaced with P J23101, and P VanCC was inserted upstream of 
bet as described in Supplementary Table S2. Expression of the 
Ec86 retron cassette and beta recombinase by P J23101 and P VanCC, 
respectively, was further optimized by PCR amplifying pTJVSc-
rpoB with primers 2326 & 2358 and 2325 & 2359, followed by 
assembly of the two resulting amplicons using the 2x NEBuilder 
HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (NEB). The assembled pTJVSc-
rpoB promoter library was transformed into E. coli NEB5α cells, 
and recombination efficiency was determined. In addition, the 
remainder of the pTJVSc-rpoB culture was diluted 1:100 into 5 ml 
LB broth + rifampicin and grown overnight again at 30∘C. The fol-
lowing morning, the plasmid library was extracted, retransformed 
into E. coli NEB5α cells, and the process was repeated three more 
times. After the fourth round of selection, the pTJVSc-rpoB plas-
mid was extracted from four randomly chosen transformants and 
the PJ23101 and PVanCC promoters were sequenced with primers 746 
and 2252, respectively, to assess the convergence of the population 
on a single optimal promoter sequence, yielding pTJV1Sc-rpoB as 
indicated in Supplementary Table S2.
2.4 Cas9 counterselection
For pCas9CR4 for CRISPR/Cas9 directed counterselection against 
unedited wild-type cells, transformants with editing plasmid 
were outgrown overnight. The following morning cultures were 
diluted 1:10 into LB + appropriate antibiotics with or without 
anhydrotetracycline (aTc; 0.1 μ
g/ml) to induce Cas9 expression 
and then grown overnight at 30 ∘C. Serial dilutions were spotted 
onto LB + rifampicin for the rpoB assays, LB + tetracycline for the 
tetA reversion assays, or M9 chloroacetate for the ackA assays, 
then incubated overnight at 37∘C. The efficiency of Cas9 counters-
election was determined by dividing the number of colonies from 
the aTc-induced cultures that grew with selection by the total 
number of viable cells plated on a nonselective plate. Results are 
reported as the mean with standard error for three independent 
replicates.
2.5 Efficiency improvement with negative 
mutator alleles
The mutL gene was cloned into pCas9CR4 as described in 
Supplementary Table S2. The cymR repressor and PcymRC promoter 
(22) were inserted upstream of mutL to allow for inducible 
expression by the addition of cumate, yielding pCas9CyMutL. 
Escherichia coli MG1655 cells harboring pCas9CyMutL were then 
transformed with pTJV1Sc-rpoB1 or pTJV1Sc-tetA and recovered 
in 1 ml SOB at 30 ∘C for 2 h, after which cells were transferred 
to 5 ml LB + chloramphenicol + spectinomycin with or without 
cumate (100 μM) and outgrown overnight at 30 ∘C
 . Cultures were 
diluted 1:10 into LB+ chloramphenicol + spectinomycin + cumate 
with or without aTc (0.1 μg/ml) and grown overnight at 30 ∘C . 
Recombination efficiency and efficiency of Cas9 counterselec-
tion were determined the following day, and the results are 
reported as the mean with standard error for three independent
replicates.
2.6 Off-target mutation frequency analysis
Escherichia coli MG1655 was separately transformed with pTV1β-
rpoB and pCas9CyMutL and plated on LB + spectinomycin and 
LB + chloramphenicol, respectively, for the selection of transfor-
mants. Single colonies from each transformation were used to 
inoculate 5 ml LB broth + appropriate antibiotic in triplicate and 
grown overnight at 30∘C, with pCas9CyMutL grown with or with-
out cumate (100 μM). Cultures were then diluted 1:10 into the 
same 
media and grown for an additional overnight at 30 ∘C, after 
which 10 μL of 10-fold serial dilutions of each were spotted onto 
LB only and LB + rifampicin to assess the spontaneous mutation 
frequency.
For genome sequencing, a single colony from each transforma-
tion and wild-type MG1655 were grown in LB broth + appropriate 
antibiotic overnight at 30 ∘C, with pCas9CyMutL grown with and 
without cumate (100 μM) for induction of mutL expr ession. Cul-
tures were then diluted 1:100, grown overnight and repeated 
for a total of two setbacks. Genomic DNA was extracted after 
the first setback for wild-type and after the second setback for 
the other samples using a cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide 
(CTAB)/phenol-chloroform extraction protocol (23).
Samples were prepared for whole-genome sequencing using 
the NEBNext Ultra II FS DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB). 
Sequencing was performed using the NovaSeq6000 sequencing 
platform (Novogene Co. Sacramento, CA). Sequencing data were 
quality filtered and adapters were trimmed using the Trim Galore 
script (24). Mutations were identified using the Breseq mutational 
analysis pipeline (25) set to polymorphism mode with the default 
parameters and a minimum coverage cutoff of 20× reads. The E. 
coli MG1655 reference genome (National Center for Biotechnology 
Information (NCBI) accession: NC_000913) was used as the refer-
ence sequence. The wild-type MG1655 parent strain was used as 
a control to assess differences between the reference genome and 
our lab strain and sequence variations identified were subtracted 
from those found in our experimental samples.
3. Results
3.1 Improvement of recombineering with 
reverse-transcribed ssDNA
To enable an efficient and iterative system for genome editing 
with ssDNA reverse-transcribed in vivo, we moved the SCRIBE sys-
tem’s functional components to the pKDsgRNA plasmid that has 
the temperature-sensitive variant of the pSC101 origin to allow 
for easy curing with growth at 37–42 ∘C ( 21, 26, 27). This plas-
mid, pTLlSc, possesses the msr-msd coding sequence and Ec86 RT 
for the synthesis of ssDNA, the bet gene to facilitate incorpora-
tion of the ssDNA and the S. pyogenes single-guide RNA (sgRNA) 
to enable Cas9 targeting. The judicious design of this plasmid

enables easy one-step cloning to retarget both the msd and sgRNA 
(Supplementary Figure S2). To assess the recombination efficiency 
using an easily selectable mutation, the msr-msd was retargeted to 
introduce three consecutive nucleotide substitutions and create 
the P564L point mutation of rpoB that confers rifampicin resis-
tance (Figure 1B). Here, we define recombination efficiency as the 
number of cells obtained on selective media divided by the total 
number of viable cells. First, we compared the efficiency of pFF745, 
described by Farzadfard et al., which possesses a high-copy pUC 
origin targeted to rpoB, with our temperature-sensitive plasmid 
pTLlSc-rpoB. As expected, recombination efficiency was about 
100-fold lower with the temperature-sensitive plasmid, presum-
ably because of decreased expression of the retron elements and 
bet compared to the high-copy pUC origin on pFF745 (Figure 1D). 
We sought to improve this efficiency by increasing the transcrip-
tion of the msr-msd, RT and bet through promoter replacements. 
The strong constitutive promoter P J23101 ( 28) replaced the P lacO
promoter driving expression of the msr-msd RNA and RT. The 
promoter of bet was changed to P VanCC ( 22) because it is both 
str
ong and nonhomologous to P J23101. Replacing these promoters 
individually did not increase recombination efficiency, but when 
combined, efficiency increased nearly 10-fold (Figure 1D).
To further increase recombination efficiency, we used a selec-
tion strategy where a library of variant plasmids was created by 
cloning degeneracies into both the P J23101 and P VanCC promoters. 
We hypothesized that variants with increased efficiency would 
overtake the population after repeated rounds of outgrowth, selec-
tion, plasmid extraction and re-transformation (Supplementary 
Figure S1A). After four passages, the efficiency of the evolved pool 
was slightly higher than the original construct (Supplementary 
Figure S1B), and sequencing of the promoter from randomly cho-
sen transformants revealed a convergence of the pool toward a 
single promoter sequence that had a recombination efficiency 
of nearly 10-fold greater than the parent plasmid (Supplemen-
tary Figure S1C–D). Moreover, the efficiency of the improved con-
struct, pTJV1Sc-rpoB, was similar to the original SCRIBE plasmid, 
pFF745–rpoB (Figure 1D).
3.2 CRISPR/Cas9 counterselection against 
wild-type cells
We next investigated whether our improved in vivo recombi-
neering system could be combined with CRISPR/Cas9 counter-
selection against wild-type cells for a highly efficient genome 
editing system. The pCas9CR4 plasmid has cas9 under the con-
trol of an inducible P tet promoter that was engineered to enable 
co-maintenance with a genome targeting sgRNA until induc-
tion with anhydrotetracycline (aTc) (27). We first transformed 
pCas9CR4 into the E. coli strains NEB5α, BL21-DE3 and MG1655, 
and 
subsequently transformed the pTJV1Sc-rpoB editing vector, 
which possessed an sgRNA targeted to wild-type rpoB. After recov-
ery
, the cells were transferred to LB broth with spectinomycin 
and chloramphenicol to select for both plasmids and grown 
overnight. The following morning, the cultures were then passed 
into media with or without aTc and grown an additional overnight 
for induction of Cas9 expression and killing of unedited cells. 
Cells were then spotted onto plates with and without rifampicin 
to directly select for the rpoB mutation and assess total viable 
cells, respectively (Figure 2A). The recombination efficiency was 
Figure 2. Targeted counterselection against unedited cells by inducible cas9 expression. (A) After Beta-recombination, cells are sub-cultured 1:10 into 
media with aTc to induce cas9 expression from pCasCR4. Constitutive expression of an sgRNA from pTJV1Sc-rpoB targets rpoBWT alleles for DNA DSB 
by Cas9 cleavage, thereby eliminating nonmutated cells. (B) Escherichia coli NEB5α, BL21 and MG1655 cells were transformed with pTJV1Sc-rpoB and 
the RpoBP564L fr
equencies were determined by plating on LB+ rifampicin. (C) Escherichia coli MG1655::tetAR was transformed with pTJV1Sc-rpoB, 
pTJV1Sc-tetA and pTJV1Sc-ackA. Frequencies of the RpoBP564L, TetA*70Y and AckAE54* mutations were determined by plating cells on LB+ rifampicin, 
tetracycline and chloroacetate, respectively. (D) Sequential mutation of distinct loci was performed by transforming E. coli MG1655 with pTJV1Sc-rpoB, 
determining recombination efficiency by plating on LB+ rifampicin, curing pTJV1Sc-rpoB by growing cells at 42∘C, then transforming once more with 
pTJV1Sc-ackA. Double mutant frequency was assessed by plating on LB+ rifampicin + sodium chloroacetate. Averages are based on three independent 
replicates. Error bars represent SEM. Statistical significance is denoted by asterisks (**= P-value < 0.01; ***= P-value <0.001; two-tailed Student’s t-test of 
log-transformed values).
between 1 × 10–5 and 3 × 10–3 without induction of Cas9 expression 
for all three strains. However, when cas9 was induced, the average 
efficiency was ∼5% for BL21 and 60–80% for NEB5 α and MG1655, 
indicating a substantial r
eduction in wild-type cells (Figure 2B).
T
o demonstrate that our system could mutagenize different 
targets, we examined the recombination efficiency of tetA and 
ackA. We inserted the tetA encoded tetracycline efflux pump that 
possessed a premature stop codon of about 200 bp from the 
start codon into MG1655 using traditional λ-Red recombineering 
(21). Our experiments then mutated the stop codon back to a 
sense 
codon, creating the TetA *70Y mutation to enable the full-
length translation of tetA and confer tetracycline resistance to the 
cells. We obtained tetracycline-resistant colonies with efficiencies 
of 5.4 × 10 –4 and 1.8 × 10 –5 with and without Cas9 counterse-
lection, respectively, much lower than those observed for rpoB
(Figure 2C). Next, the acetate kinase gene, ac
 kA, was mutated 
with three nucleotide point mutations to create a premature stop 
codon (AckAE54*) so that the cells are unable to metabolize acetate 
and are thus resistant to the toxic acetate analog chloroacetate. 
A recombination efficiency of 5.6% without Cas9 counterselec-
tion and over 100% with induction of Cas9 was obtained, as 
slightly more colonies were observed on the selection plate than 
on the nonselective plate on average (Figure 2C). These experi-
ments show that targeted counterselection of unedited cells with 
Cas9 can successfully enrich for recombinants across distinct loci.
The pCas9CR4 plasmid used in these experiments was 
designed for tight repression of cas9 and an ssrA degradation tag 
decreases Cas9 stability, enabling co-maintenance of both genome 
targeting sgRNA template and cas9 on two plasmids. Although 
induction of cas9 is required for cell death by double-strand break 
(DSB), we questioned whether some transient level of Cas9 expres-
sion also enriches for recombinants, thus we performed exper-
iments to compare the number of mutants obtained with the 
SCRIBE system in the presence and absence of pCas9CR4. More 
recombinant cells were produced for all three targets with cells 
harboring pCas9CR4 than cells without, even without induction 
of cas9 expression (Figure 2C). In fact, we were unable to obtain 
tetr
acycline-resistant cells when using the pTJV1Sc-tetA plasmid 
alone. These results suggest that even low levels of cas9 expres-
sion in the uninduced state can increase recombination efficiency 
possibly by slowing the growth of wild-type cells that must repair 
DSB or because this low-level DSB stimulates recombination.
The proposed mechanism of ssDNA recombineering asserts 
that allelic replacement occurs at the replication fork, where 
the supplied ssDNA replaces an Okazaki fragment on the lag-
ging strand. This mechanism results in a lagging strand bias, 
where recombination efficiencies for oligos targeting the lagging 
strand are higher than those targeting the leading strand. To 
assess whether in vivo produced ssDNA proceeds through the 
same mechanism, we targeted the leading strand of rpoB for edit-
ing (Supplementary Figure S3A). Surprisingly, this resulted in a 
similar efficiency as targeting the lagging strand (Supplementary 
Figure S3B). We wondered whether this was a function of the in 
vivo generation of ssDNA or if the same would be true of the rpoB
target using traditional λ-Red recombineering. We constructed a 
contr
ol plasmid in which the msr-msd and RT coding sequences 
were removed (pTV1β-rpoB), resulting in constitutive expression 
of 
Beta only and sgRNA targeting rpoB. We then performed a tra-
ditional recombineering experiment by transforming exogenous 
ssDNA into cells with this plasmid and pCas9CR4 and observed 
that the lagging oligo was much more efficient, consistent with 
previous observations (7, 9, 29) and the proposed mechanism of 
ssDN
A recombineering (Supplementary Figure S3C ). To evaluate 
whether the same phenomenon is true of other targets using 
SCRIBE, we targeted the leading strand of tetA with the in vivo sys-
tem (Supplementary Figure S3A). In this case, over 1000-fold fewer 
recombinant cells were obtained than when targeting the lagging 
strand (Supplementary Figure S3D). While we suspect that recom-
bineering with in vivo ssDNA occurs at the lagging strand of the 
replication fork, our data suggest that the constant availability 
of ssDNA may be sufficient to overcome the lagging strand bias 
in some cases or that an alternative mechanism may influence 
recombination rates at some locations.
3.3 Iterative mutagenesis of two targets
Above all, the high efficiency of mutagenesis found at our target 
sites confirms a robust system for genome editing, precluding the 
need to screen large numbers of colonies to identify mutants. To 
demonstrate that our system could iteratively construct genome 
modifications, cells that were mutated at the rpoB locus were 
grown at 42∘C to cure the cells of pTJV1Sc-rpoB. Subsequent trans-
formation with pTJV1Sc-ackA enabled mutation of the ackA gene 
and produced cells resistant to both rifampicin and chloroacetate 
(Figure 2D). Amplification and Sanger sequencing of the rpoB and 
ac
kA loci showed that both intended mutations were made, con-
firming that iterative use of the system could edit multiple loci 
independently (Supplementary Figure S4).
3.4 Co-Expression of dominant-negative mutL
Recombineering with ssDNA results in transient production of 
heteroduplex DNA that the methyl-directed mismatch repair 
(MMR) system can repair, thus decreasing the observed rate of 
mutagenesis. Several strategies are known to decrease the rate of 
MMR and enable more efficient mutagenesis (15, 17, 30–
32). For 
example, single bp mismatches are repaired with different effi-
ciencies, while C:C mismatches evade repair entirely and prevent 
repair of mismatches within 3 bp (17, 31). The introduction of 
several adjacent mismatches also prevents repair by MMR (15). 
However, these strategies present design constraints that can-
not always be followed. An alternate strategy is the recombinant 
expression of negative mutS or mutL variants that are dominant 
over wild-type enzymes and prevent efficient repair (32). Accord-
ingly, we cloned mutL with the dominant negative E32K muta-
tion into the pCas9CR4 plasmid under the control of a cumate 
inducible promoter (22) to maintain a two-plasmid system with 
independent control of cas9 and mutL (Figure 3A). To test this sys-
tem, 
we introduced a single bp mismatch of A:C in rpoB with 
and without induction of the negative mutL. In cells harboring 
pCas9CyMutL 
with mutL in the off-state, the average frequency 
of rifampicin-resistant mutants was 4.9 × 10 –6 without Cas9-
induction and 4.5 × 10 –4 with Cas9 counterselection ( Figure 3B). 
In contrast, the induction of mutL enabled rpoB mutations with 
an average recombination efficiency of 0.2% and 18% without 
and with Cas9 counterselection (Figure 3B). We also re-examined 
the tetA reversion assays, which introduced a single bp T:T mis-
match that is less efficiently repaired than the A:C mismatch used 
for rpoB. Induction of the mutator allele increased the recombi-
nation efficiency by about 100-fold both with and without Cas9 
counterselection, achieving a maximum efficiency of 0.3% on aver-
age (Figure 3C). When generating a single A:G mismatch in the 
ackA gene, mutL induction improved recombination by 1000- and 
100-fold with and without Cas9 counterselection, respectively, 
resulting in an average maximum efficiency of 56% ( Figure 3D). 
These results further highlight the versatility of our system in 
generating precise mutations across a diverse range of loci. 
To further illustrate the efficiency enhancement these tools 
offer over previous methods, we performed the same experiments 
using the no-SCAR method described previously (12). Single-
stranded editing oligos targeting the lagging strand were used to 
introduce the same single bp mismatches as before in cells harbor-
ing pCas9CyMutL and pKDsgRNA, a plasmid encoding the λ-Red 
pr
oteins Exo, Beta and Gam under the control of the arabinose-
inducible PBAD promoter, as well as an sgRNA targeting the wild 
type gene sequences. When targeting rpoB, induction of mutL
before transformation, during recovery, or both achieved sim-
ilarly high recombination rates as the retron system, yielding 
average efficiencies >2% with direct selection on rifampicin and 
100% with Cas9 counterselection, a 20-fold increase in recom-
binants than without mutL (Supplementary Figure S5A). Regard-
less 
of whether mutL was induced, Cas9 counterselection effec-
tively removed unedited cells with 95% of cells plated on aTc 
being rifampicin-resistant even without mutL expression. On the 
contrary, when targeting ackA, mutL induction improved the 
recombination efficiency less than 10-fold, yielding a maximum 
efficiency of 4.8 × 10–4 when plated on chloroacetate (Supplemen-
tary Figure S5B ). However, sequencing the ackA gene of several 
putative mutant colonies on the chloroacetate selection media 
revealed none had acquired the intended mutation. Furthermore, 
Cas9 counterselection did not substantially enrich for mutants, 
with <5% of the colonies on the aTc-induced plate able to grow 
with chloroacetate when patched (Supplementary Figure S5B), 
indicating most of the colonies on the counterselection plate 
escaped Cas9 killing. These results are consistent with previous 
studies examining the rate of Cas9 escape in bacteria, which 
report frequencies ranging from ∼10−3 to 10−4 in multiple species 
(11, 27
 , 33, 34). Overall, the combined mutL and retron-based sys-
tems result in consistently high mutagenesis rates for single bp 
edits and can outperform traditional oligo recombineering meth-
ods for certain target loci.
Figure 3. Expression of dominant-negative MutL allele enhances recombination efficiency for single nucleotide point mutations. (A) The MutLE32K gene 
was cloned into the pCas9CR4 plasmid under the control of the PCymRC promoter for inducible expression. When cumate is added, MutLE32K is 
expressed and competes with the native MutL for binding to MutS during mismatch repair. The E32K mutation prevents MutH binding, inhibiting 
removal and repair of the mismatched base. Cells harboring pCas9CyMutL were transformed with (B) pTJV1Sc-rpoB1, (C) pTJV1Sc-tetA or (D) 
pTJV1Sc-ackA1 encoding single point mutations for generating the RpoBP564L, TetA*70Y and AckAE54* mutations, respectively, and grown in liquid 
culture with or without cumate. The unmodified pCas9CR4 in both wild-type E. coli and a mutS mutant were used as controls. Recombination 
efficiency with and without Cas9 counterselection was assessed by plating on LB+ rifampicin, LB+ tetracycline or M9+ chloroacetate. Data reported 
are the average of three independent replicates. Error bars represent SEM and statistical significance relative to pCas9CR4 is denoted by asterisks 
(ns = not significant; * = P-value < 0.05; **= P
-value < 0.01; ***= P-value <0.001; one-way analysis of variance and Tukey’s test of log-transformed values).
Hindrance of MMR increases the frequency of background 
genome mutations ( 35, 36); however, the inducibility of our sys-
tem minimizes the amount of time in which MMR is inhibited. 
Similarly, uncontrolled expression of the λ-Red genes has also 
been shown to increase the rate of spontaneous mutations (37). 
As 
such, constitutive expression of bet in our system could con-
ceivably produce unintended recombination events in the cell. 
To assess the background rate of mutagenesis in cells with our 
SCRIBE system, we measured spontaneous rifampicin resistance 
(38, 39). Cells were grown overnight, diluted 1:10, grown overnight 
and 
then spotted on rifampicin to assess the mutation frequency. 
The wild-type cells spontaneously acquired rifampicin resistance 
at a frequency of 6 × 10–7 on average. Cells constitutively express-
ing bet and cells with the uninduced pCas9CyMutL did not dif-
fer significantly from the wild-type (Supplementary Figure S6A).
However, induction of the mutator mutL resulted in an average 
mutation frequency of about 1.3 × 10–5, an ∼20-fold increase over 
the wild-type (Supplementary Figure S6A).
While these results indicate that the unexpressed mutL and 
constitutive bet did not increase the rate of point mutations, 
we wanted to assess further whether other genomic mutations 
and rearrangements that would not manifest as rifampicin resis-
tance were present. Accordingly, we performed whole-genome 
sequencing on the strains grown for two overnights to iden-
tify polymorphisms within the entire population. A complete 
list of the mutations identified is in Supplemental File 2. Our 
analysis revealed 41 total mutations in the population constitu-
tively expressing bet, constituting a mutation rate of 5.9 × 10 –11
mutations per cell per generation (Supplementary Figure S6B), 
with one new IS5 mobile element insertion into the rclA gene.
Figure 4. Alternative recombinases can enhance efficiency for some targets. (A) The bet CDS on pTJV1Sc was replaced with genes encoding the 
CspRecT and EcRecT recombinases. Recombination efficiency for each of the recombinase variants with and without induction of cas9 expression was 
assessed for (B) the RpoBP564L mutation by plating cells on LB+ rifampicin, (C) the AckAE54* mutation by plating cells on LB+ chloroacetate and (D) the 
TetA*70Y mutation by plating cells on LB+ tetracycline. The pCas9CyMutL plasmid was used for the tetA experiments. Data reported are the average of 
three independent replicates. Error bars represent SEM and statistical significance is denoted by asterisks (ns= not significant; *** = P-value <0.001; 
one-way analysis of variance and Tukey’s test of log-transformed values).
The uninduced pCas9CyMutL cells displayed a slightly higher 
mutation rate of 2.4 × 10–10; however, both rates were similar to the 
wild-type control, which exhibited a mutation rate of 1.0 × 10 –10. 
In contrast, 478 mutations were found in the population with 
mutL induced for a mutation rate of 1.59 × 10 –9 mutations per 
cell per generation (Supplementary Figure S6B), as well as a dele-
tion of the ∼1200 bp insH21 mobile element. Even still, this low 
frequency of background mutations indicates selecting a mutant 
with unintended mutations would be a rare occurrence. Over-
all, these results demonstrate that maintenance of plasmids with 
the mutL mutator allele or constitutive expression of bet do not 
increase the frequency of background mutations to a level that 
would cause concern from a genetic engineering standpoint.
3.5 Alternative recombinases enhance efficiency 
for some targets
Recently, Wannier et al. identified recT from a Collinsella stercoris
phage (CspRecT) with improved recombination efficiency com-
pared to Beta for oligo mediated recombineering in E. coli (40). 
T
o examine the effect of alternative recombinases in our sys-
tem, we replaced bet with CspRecT, as well as EcRecT from 
the E. coli BL21-DE3 chromosome (Figure 4A). We then compared 
the efficiency of these plasmids across three different targets.
Surprisingly, our results showed inconsistency for which DNA-
binding protein promoted the highest number of recombinants 
between the different targets. For the rpoB mutation, EcRecT was 
more efficient than both Beta and CspRecT, with 92% efficiency 
when using Cas9 counterselection (Figure 4B). On the contrary, the 
ackA mutation was more efficient with Beta, where 80% of cells 
were mutants compared to 4.5% for CspRecT and no ackA mutants 
with EcRecT ( Figure 4C). Given the improvement in efficiency 
seen for tetA when expressing MutL E32K, we used pCas9CyMutL 
in combination with the alternative recombinases. We obtained 
over 100% efficiency for the tetA reversion with CspRecT, both 
with and without Cas9 counterselection. Although slightly more 
colonies were observed on the tetracycline plate than on the non-
selective plate for two of the replicates (Figure 4D), the CspRecT 
clearly outperformed Beta and EcRecT where relatively low levels 
of mutants were found. Thus, in circumstances where a muta-
tion is difficult to obtain, it is advisable to try these alternative 
recombinases, while the mechanism causing these discrepancies 
warrants further investigation.
4. Discussion
In moving the SCRIBE machinery onto the temperature-sensitive 
pSC101 origin of replication and combining it with Cas9 coun-
terselection, we successfully constructed an in vivo system for 
ssDNA recombineering that is highly efficient and iterative.
Targeted counterselection using CRISPR/Cas9 enabled efficiencies 
near 100% after a single night of outgrowth post-transformation, 
reducing the number of colonies needing to be screened 
for mutant identification. Moreover, both the ssDNA tem-
plate and sgRNA sequence can be retargeted for modification 
of any genomic locus with an appropriate PAM in a single 
cloning step using sequence overlap cloning methods. Numer-
ous loci can be mutated without the need for orthogonal 
selection markers or extensive screening procedures, increas-
ing the speed and ease of generating desirable mutants. In 
addition, the pCas9CR4 and pCas9CyMutL plasmids can be 
cured using pKDsgRNA-p15 (Addgene #62656) as previously 
described (12), yielding plasmid-free mutants for downstream
applications.
Recombineering is an important tool in the biological sci-
ences, and continued enhancement of recombination efficiency 
across diverse target loci will decrease strain construction times. 
Recently, Lopez et al. showed that increasing the abundance of 
ssDNA produced by retrons significantly improves recombina-
tion efficiencies (41), consistent with the enhanced efficiencies 
we observed when increasing the msr–msd/RT expression and bet
through promoter modifications. A complementary strategy is to 
reduce the rate of ssDNA degradation by host nucleases, as the 
High-efficiency SCRIBE (HiSCRIBE) system by Farzadfard et al. (20) 
describes
. This system improves upon their original SCRIBE design 
by coupling a strong ribosome-binding site for bet on the SCRIBE 
plasmid with CRISPRi-enabled transcriptional interference of the 
endogenous exonucleases. Recombination efficiencies of nearly 
100% for galK and ∼25% for a kanamycin resistance gene tar-
get 
were obtained with these improvements. However, employing 
the nuclease-deficient dCas9 for CRISPRi prevents the use of the 
nuclease-active Cas9 for counterselection. Although the authors 
show that CRISPR/Cas9 counterselection can select for recombi-
nant cells at high efficiencies in an exonuclease knockout strain, 
this strategy prevents easy system portability since a mutant 
strain must be used.
Lim et al. (42) also describe a CRISPR/retron-based editing sys-
tem 
enabling trackable editing and functional screening across 
multiple loci in a population. However, this system requires the 
sequential transformation and maintenance of three plasmids. 
Moreover, the construction of their retron/sgRNA plasmid requires 
multiple enzymatic digestions for cloning, contrary to our two-
plasmid system, which simultaneously retargets the retron and 
sgRNA in a single two-fragment cloning step. Most importantly, 
both the HiSCRIBE and the CRISPR/retron system of Lim et al.
(20, 42) would require multiple orthogonal selection markers to 
m
utate multiple loci within a single cell, as no easy method of 
plasmid curing is included in either design, preventing iterative 
mutagenesis. Although the recombination efficiencies achieved 
with our system in the absence of counterselection are less 
than those reported for HiSCRIBE, Cas9-induced cell death of 
unedited cells in the population enabled apparent efficiencies on 
par with HiSCRIBE. The ease with which our system can be retar-
geted and used iteratively to incorporate multiple edits combined 
with its high efficiency in mutant selection provides a quick and 
straightforward method for constructing mutants relevant to both 
research and biotechnological applications. Methods enabling 
multiplexed editing of numerous genomic loci within populations 
and continuous evolution of targeted loci, using retron-mediated 
recombineering, have been recently described (20, 42–44) and rely 
on efficient editing for generating a library of variants. Our sys-
tem would be well suited for constructing such libraries, with 
the added advantage of being curable, thus enabling editing of 
distant loci within the same cell through repeated rounds of 
library recombineering.
