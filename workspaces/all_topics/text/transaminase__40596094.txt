Chronic stress, a common condition in modern life, is increasingly connected to a variety of 
medical concerns, including liver damage. Despite being one of the body’s most resilient organs, 
the liver is yet susceptible to the harmful effects of chronic stress. This study aimed to investigate 
the therapeutic effects of fluoxetine and agomelatine on the liver after exposure to the chronic 
restraint stress (CRS) model in rats. Thirty-six male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomized into four 
groups: control, CRS + vehicle, CRS + fluoxetine, and CRS + agomelatine. Except for controls, all rats 
underwent CRS (2.5 h/day) for five weeks. During the last three weeks, groups received daily oral 
vehicle, fluoxetine, or agomelatine. Behavioral tests, forced swim test (FST) and sucrose preference 
test (SPT), were performed in the final week. Blood and liver samples were collected for biochemical 
and immunohistochemical analyses for liver enzymes, hepatic oxidative stress, and apoptotic and 
proliferative markers. The use of agomelatine for three consecutive weeks in CRS rats reversed 
immobility and climbing and slightly improved sucrose preference. No significant changes were 
detected in plasma liver transaminases compared to the control or treated groups. Nonetheless, 
agomelatine treatment significantly attenuated the oxidative stress induced by CRS, particularly 
in malondialdehyde (MDA) level (*P ≤ 0.05). The histological examination of liver tissues revealed 
fluoxetine and agomelatine mitigated CRS-induced cellular infiltration and nuclear hyperchromasia. 
Additionally, both drugs significantly reduced the upregulation of caspase-3 (***P ≤ 0.001) and 
proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA, ***P ≤ 0.001) in CRS rats. This study revealed for the first time 
the potential therapeutic role of fluoxetine and agomelatine on the liver during the CRS depression 
model by controlling oxidative stress and hepatic regeneration.

Chronic stress (CS) is a common public health concern, it is consistently linked to various mental health issues, 
including depression and sleep disorders 1. CS can become detrimental to the body’s homeostasis, disrupting 
many organs, including the liver2. Studies indicate a strong correlation between liver disorders, depression, and 
stress3–5. Higher levels of psychological distress are associated with increased liver disease mortality rates 6. The 
pathophysiological link between liver function and CS or depression is increasingly recognized as a critical 
factor in systemic health, with a bidirectional relationship evident between hepatic and neuropsychiatric 
dysfunction. CS can alter hepatic metabolic profiles and gene expression, affecting how it processes nutrients 
and toxins7, and potentially contribute to metabolic disorders such as insulin resistance and fatty liver disease8. 
CS and depression may elevate the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma by epigenetically downregulating 
hypocretin (orexin), which has a role in stress control9.
Interactions between the endocrine and sympathetic nervous systems are intricate in CS. Dysregulation of the 
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis can elevate cortisol levels and alter neurotransmitter systems. This 
imbalance may negatively affect hepatic tissue, leading to inflammation and disease progression10,11. Moreover, 
over recent years, the effects of CS on the exacerbation of liver diseases such as hepatitis and nonalcoholic fatty 
liver disease (NAFLD) have been acknowledged as a relevant factor3,12–15. Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome and 
enhanced intestinal permeability can increase systemic inflammation and disturb the gut-liver-brain axis, which 
contributes to the connection between depression and liver disorders4,16. In addition, soluble epoxide hydrolase, 
a liver enzyme that hydrolyzes epoxides derived from arachidonic acid, is pivotal in controlling behavioral 
and cellular impacts of prolonged stress 17. Hepatic overexpression of this enzyme induces a depressive-like 
phenotype17. Thus, the liver may play a significant role in controlling mood. Zhou and his colleagues (2024) 
revealed a “brain-to-liver” neural connection that mediates the impairment of liver regeneration in a CRS 
model in mice. Notably, this study focused primarily on liver samples after confirming the stress model through 
anxiety-related behavior tests only 18. Significant elevations in serum ALT and hepatic levels of inflammatory 
markers, as well as degeneration and necrosis of hepatocytes and inflammatory cell infiltration, have all occurred 
in the liver tissue of rats exposed to psychological CS 12. The role of psychological CS in exacerbating hepatitis 
and promoting liver fibrosis has gained increasing recognition over recent years 14,19. These findings provide a 
compelling rationale for investigating the liver’s role in the pathophysiology of depression and anhedonia. They 
also emphasize the importance of managing depression and stress in patients with liver disease by incorporating 
antidepressant interventions.
Fluoxetine is a selective serotonin uptake inhibitor; it is widely used as a first-line treatment for depression 
and exerts its therapeutic effect by increasing serotonin availability in the brain. In addition to its antidepressant 
action, fluoxetine has been shown to ameliorate stress-induced oxidative damage20. It possesses neuroprotective 
activity by reducing oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptotic responses in the peripheral and central 
nervous systems 21. Agomelatine is a naphthalene analog of melatonin; it has a unique antidepressant with 
dual mechanisms of action, exhibiting melatonin receptor (MT 1 and MT 2) agonism and serotonin 5-HT 2C 
receptor antagonism. It has shown efficacy in treating both depression and anxiety disorders 22,23. This dual

mechanism can resynchronize sleep rhythms that are commonly disturbed during depression and control core 
depressive symptoms24–26. Additionally, agomelatine can increase brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) 
expression, promote neurogenesis, and mitigate stress-induced glutamate release 26. Some studies have shown 
that agomelatine is effective with a rapid onset of antidepressant effect and good tolerability 27,28. Experimental 
depression models revealed that agomelatine reduced oxidative stress in the liver and other organs after chronic 
mild stress (CMS) 29. It exhibits antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects against paracetamol-induced liver 
injury30. Some experimental studies showed some potential protective effects of agomelatine in other models of 
tissue injuries31–34.
Although considerable advances have been achieved in depression research, the mechanisms that underlie 
its association with liver pathogenesis remain obscure and necessitate further investigation. Here, we implement 
chronic restraint stress (CRS) because it causes anxiety- and depression-like behaviors after stress 35. Assessing 
the effect of fluoxetine and agomelatine on the liver during CRS is preferred, as they are used in such conditions, 
and stress per se may affect liver function, as previously reported 29. Therefore, this study aims to investigate 
the effects of subchronic use of fluoxetine and agomelatine on rat liver after exposure to CRS. It intentionally 
focuses on hepatic degeneration and regeneration parameters because these can serve as upstream indicators 
and mechanistic triggers of the systemic inflammation and metabolic disturbances that ultimately affect brain 
function. Chronic stress disrupts the gut-liver-brain axis, contributing to hepatic oxidative stress and apoptosis, 
which are understudied in depression models. Our study bridges this gap by examining liver-specific pathways 
(e.g., caspase-3, PCNA) influenced by stress-induced HPA axis dysregulation.
Materials and methods
All methods were performed in accordance with the relevant guidelines and regulations, including the ARRIVE 
guidelines36. The use of animals and experimental work followed the ethical principles and guidelines approved 
by the Research Ethics Committee at King Saud University (Ethics Reference No: KSU-SE‐20‐75).
Materials
Fluoxetine and agomelatine were obtained from a local pharmacy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Liver enzyme kits 
for aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) and Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) were obtained from the United 
Diagnostics Industry (UDI, Dammam, Saudi Arabia). Primary antibodies were caspase 3 (ab4051, Abcam, 
Waltham, USA), Anti-Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), and clone PC10 (CBL407, Sigma-Aldrich, 
Wicklow, Ireland). Avidin-biotin-complex (ABC) kit, diaminobenzidine kit (DAB), and secondary biotinylated 
antibodies were obtained from Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA, USA. Other Reagents, such as thiobarbituric 
acid, pyrogallol, and Ellman’s reagent, were from Sigma Aldrich Chemicals Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA).
Animals
Adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats, aged 6–7 weeks old, with weights ranging from 150  g to 220  g, were 
obtained from the experimental surgery and animal laboratory center at the Prince Naif bin Abdul-Aziz Health 
Research Center (King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia). Each group of three rats was kept in individually 
ventilated cages of 18 × 25.5 × 38 cm dimensions (IVCs; Allentown LLC, US) at a temperature of 24 °C to 29 °C, a 
humidity of 25–48%, and a 12/12-hour light/dark cycle with the lights on at 4:00 am. Wood shavings were used 
as bedding, and access to pellets (1005, Saudi Grain organization, SA) and drinking water was ad libitum except 
during experimental procedures.
Experimental design
Randomization was used to divide the animals into 4 groups (6 rats/group). The experiment incorporates the use 
of CRS to establish a stress-induced depression rat model 37. In this model, the rats were placed in transparent 
plexiglass restraints in their home cages for 2.5 h per day during the light cycle. The restraint dimensions were 
selected based on the rats’ weights38. All rat groups, except the controls, underwent restraining stress for around 
5 weeks. The selection of 2.5 h/day for 5 weeks to induce CRS is supported by several studies demonstrating 
that this protocol induces robust and reproducible depression-like behaviors in rats, such as anhedonia and 
behavioral despair. Seewoo et al. (2020) and Mao et al. (2022) validated a similar CRS protocol in young adult 
rats, demonstrating that daily restraint of 2 to 2.5 h for periods of 2–5 weeks reliably induces behavioral and 
neurobiological changes relevant to human depression38–40.
The CRS protocol involved placing rats in transparent plexiglass restrainers within their home cages for 
2.5 h per day during the light phase. This procedure was conducted daily for approximately five weeks, except 
for the control group. On day 14, they received different treatments by daily oral gavage for 3 weeks with CRS. 
Group 1 (Control) consisted of neither stressed nor treated animals, left undisturbed in their home cages. Group 
2 (CRS + vehicle) consisted of stressed animals that received a daily dose of normal saline (4 ml/kg). Group 3 
(CRS + fluoxetine) consisted of stressed animals that received a daily dose of 14.4 mg/kg fluoxetine dissolved in 
4 ml/kg saline. Lastly, Group 4 (CRS + agomelatine) consisted of stressed animals that received a daily dose of 
18 mg/kg agomelatine dissolved in 4 ml/kg saline. Doses of fluoxetine and agomelatine were selected following a 
previously published work41. These doses were chosen because they have demonstrated their efficacy and safety 
in CS and depression models in rodents. The doses are within the effective range reported in the literature, and 
the administration protocols are consistent with standard preclinical practice.
All treatments were prepared daily and administered between 8:00–8:40 am before the restraining procedure. 
An interval of thirty minutes between treatments and restraining was allowed. Throughout the study period, 
all animals’ body weight was measured twice weekly. All groups were subjected to sucrose preference tests 
(SPT) after the completion of treatments, and then a forced swim test (FST) was done one day after the SPT. 
To minimize observer bias, animal coding was implemented within the blinding procedures of the behavioral

experiments and molecular and biochemical measures. Ultimately, the animals were sacrificed twenty-four 
hours after the FST, and blood and liver tissue samples were collected. Figure  1 shows an illustration of the 
experimental design and timeline.
Behavioral studies
Sucrose preference test (SPT)
The SPT is used to evaluate the core symptom of depression (anhedonia)42. It was run as described previously43 
with some modifications. Before conducting each SPT, all rats underwent a 3-day adaptation training to ensure 
that sucrose neophobia was not a confounding variable. In the first 2 days, rats were habituated to drink from 
two identical bottles that contained filtered water. On the third day, water bottles were swapped with two fresh 
1% sucrose bottles (200 ml). The SPT conducted the next day involved free access to a bottle containing water 
and an identical bottle containing an equal volume (200 ml) of fresh 1% sucrose solution (same water type and 
temperature) presented in the home cage. Rats were allowed to drink the sucrose solution for twenty hours, 
and the position of the bottles was switched halfway through this period to eliminate the potential effects of 
side preference. The timestamp for starting training and SPT was at 1:00 pm (3 h before the start of the dark 
cycle). Similar to the literature, the sucrose preference was calculated using the following formula: preference 
percentage (%) = sucrose solution consumption (ml)/ (sucrose solution consumption [ml] + water consumption 
[ml]) × 100%44.
Forced swim test (FST)
FST assessed behavioral despair in rats45, as previously detailed46. During the light phase, rats were exposed to a 
pre-swim test swim for 15 min by being placed individually in a glass cylinder (35 cm in diameter, 50 cm high) 
filled with 25 ± 2 °C water to a depth of 37 cm. The next day, rats were reintroduced to the cylinder for 5 min, and 
their behaviors were video recorded. The testing was carried out after thirty minutes in the experimental room 
to avoid novelty-induced behaviors. After each trial, animals were dried with absorbent paper, placed in a warm 
Fig. 1. Schematic representation of the experimental design and timeline. The experimental design illustrated 
in the figure spans five weeks. During the first week (days 1–7), all mice underwent an adaptation period to 
acclimate to their surroundings. For the subsequent three weeks (days 8–28), chronic restraint stress (CRS) 
was induced in three groups (Groups 2, 3, and 4), while the first group (Group 1) served as an unstressed 
control. Concurrently, the stressed groups received daily treatments: Group 2 received a vehicle, Group 3 
was administered a daily dose of 14.4 mg/kg fluoxetine, and Group 4 received a daily dose of 18 mg/kg mg/
kg agomelatine. In the final week, behavioral assessments were conducted, with the Sucrose Preference Test 
(SPT) taking place on days 31–33 and the Forced Swim Test (FST) on days 34–36. SPT consisted of a three-
day training phase followed by a test day. During the training phase, animals were presented with two bottles 
containing 200 ml of drinking water and 1% sucrose solution. On the test day, their preference for the sucrose 
solution was assessed. FST consisted of a training phase followed by a test phase conducted over two days. On 
the last day of the experiment (day 37), samples, likely including liver tissue and blood, were collected from all 
four groups for subsequent analysis.

cage for fifteen minutes, and then returned to their home cage. The predominant behavior was rated manually 
every 5 s throughout the test session recordings. Immobility, swimming, and climbing were the main behaviors 
observed. Immobility comprised floating without struggling, and slight movements necessary for the rat to keep 
its head above water. Swimming was described as horizontal movements that included crossing into another 
quadrant and diving, and climbing was defined as upward movements of the forepaws against the cylinder wall.
Blood and tissue sampling and Preparation
The day after FST, rats were anesthetized using an intraperitoneal injection of 91 mg/kg ketamine combined with 
9.1 mg/kg xylazine. Blood samples were drawn by cardiac puncture and added immediately into heparinized 
vacutainers. The animals were sacrificed through exsanguination, followed by heart excision to ensure their 
deaths. Whole liver tissues were then carefully harvested and washed with ice-cold phosphate-buffered saline 
(PBS). Parts of liver samples were homogenized in 10 mM ice-cold Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.4), centrifuged, and 
the supernatants were kept at -80 °C for further analyses. For histological and immunological studies, some parts 
of liver tissues were isolated and fixed in 4% phosphate-buffered formaldehyde (pH 7.4).
Determination of liver transaminases
Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) activity levels in plasma were measured 
spectrophotometrically by commercially available colorimetric kits from UDI, Dammam, Saudi Arabia. The rate 
of decrease in the measured absorbance at 340 nm was taken as directly proportional to enzyme activity.
Evaluation of oxidative stress markers
The level of malondialdehyde (MDA), lipid peroxidation end-product, in the liver samples was measured using 
the TBA reagent as previously described by Ohkawa et al.47. TBA reacts with MDA content in the tissue at 95 °C, 
generating pink to orange color products that are measured colorimetrically at 535 nm. In addition, the level 
of hepatic reduced glutathione (GSH), the main nonenzymatic antioxidant, was measured using the Ellman 
reagent as described by Ellman at 412  nm 48. The activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the liver tissue 
was measured using the Marklund method with pyrogallol reagent49. Rapid auto-oxidation of the pyrogallol in 
aqueous solution results in a yellow color visible at 430 nm.
Histopathology and immunohistochemistry
Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) liver Sect. (5 μm thickness) were dewaxed by xylene and then placed 
in 100% ethanol, 95% ethanol, 70% ethanol, and distilled water for 10 min each. Some sections were stained 
with Hematoxylin and Eosin for histological evaluation. Antigen retrieval (AR) was performed on other sections 
for immunohistochemistry (IHC). AR was conducted by heating the sections in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) 
for 8 min. The sections were then permeabilized by phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) /0.3% Triton X for one 
hour and then blocked by 10% FBS in the permeabilizing buffer for one hour. The sections were then probed 
overnight at 4 °C using primary antibodies for caspase-3 and PCNA at recommended dilutions. After being 
washed the next day, the sections were incubated for two hours with the secondary biotin-conjugated antibody. 
After washing, the sections were incubated for 30 min with an avidin-biotin-peroxidase combination (ABC, 
Vector Laboratories). The sections were treated with chromogen diaminobenzidine (DAB, Vector) and left in 
the dark until a brown precipitate developed. The sections were then washed, mounted, and examined under a 
light microscope.
Statistical analysis
The analysis was done using the Prism 9 Software (Graphpad, California, USA). The number of samples was 
calculated by Power G software 50, which determined a sample size of 24 rats (6 per group) at 80% power and 
95% confidence, ensuring adequate statistical power to detect CRS effects while minimizing animal use. Data 
normality was evaluated using the Shapiro-Wilk test. If the data were normally distributed, parametric tests were 
used. Differences between the study groups and the degree of significance were determined using an unpaired 
Student’s t-test for comparing two independent groups, one-way analysis of variance (ANOV A), or repeated 
measures of two-way ANOV A with Tukey’s post hoc test for three or more groups. A P values of < 0.05 were 
deemed statistically significant.
Results
Effect of Fluoxetine and agomelatine on body weight during CRS
Rats showed a significant reduction in their body weight after twelve days of CRS exposure compared to the 
control rats ( P ≤ 0.001, F (5, 17) = 2.087, Fig.  2A). Restrained rats continued to weigh significantly less than 
controls throughout the 3 weeks of vehicle administration ( P ≤ 0.05, Fig. 2B). The percentage of body weight 
change remained significantly low in the chronically stressed group treated with agomelatine across weeks 3–5 
compared to the control group (P ≤ 0.05, F (3, 20) = 13.28). Agomelatine administration for 3 weeks in rats under 
restraint stress did not significantly improve body weight gain. However, a trend for increased body weight was 
observed following agomelatine administration compared to other treated groups. On the other hand, CRS 
depressive rats exhibited the most significant weight loss with fluoxetine compared to the control by the third 
week of treatment (P ≤ 0.001, F (3, 20) = 13.28, Fig. 2B).
Effect of Fluoxetine and agomelatine on SPT in the CRS model of depression in rats
Rats exposed to CRS for 5 weeks and interspersed with 3 weeks of vehicle treatment exhibited the lowest sucrose 
consumption compared to other groups. However, this difference was not statistically significant (P > 0.05, F (3,

8) = 2.963, Fig. 3). After CRS rats’ treatment with antidepressants, the consumption increased, particularly in rats 
treated with agomelatine, which was comparable to the control group.
Effect of Fluoxetine and agomelatine on the modified FST in the CRS model of depression in 
rats
Compared to the normal control, rats exposed to chronic stress and treated with vehicle only showed 
significant increases in the immobility (despair) behavior ( P ≤ 0.01, F (3, 20) = 7.509). Compared to vehicle-

CRS rats, agomelatine treatment significantly decreased the immobility behavior (P ≤ 0.05). Likewise, fluoxetine 
significantly reduces immobility (P ≤ 0.01, F (3, 20) = 7.509, Fig.  4A). No changes were observed in swimming 
scores among experimental groups ( P > 0.05, F (3, 20) = 1.229, Fig.  4B). Moreover, CRS rats significantly 
decreased climbing behavior (P ≤ 0.01, F (3, 20) = 7.572). This reduction in stressed rats was significantly reversed 
by fluoxetine (P ≤ 0.01, F (3, 20) = 7.572), but not by agomelatine (P ≥ 0.05, F (3, 20) = 7.572; Fig. 4C).
Effect of Fluoxetine and agomelatine on liver transaminases in CRS rats
To investigate the effect of CRS on liver function, AST and ALT were assessed. CRS rats showed slight increases 
in AST and ALT plasma levels compared to control groups. However, these elevations did not reach the level 
of significance (P > 0.05, Fig. 5). No significant differences were observed between all studied groups in plasma 
levels of ALT and AST.

Effect of Fluoxetine and agomelatine on oxidative stress markers in CRS rats
Oxidative stress was evaluated by measuring hepatic MDA and GSH levels as well as SOD enzymatic activity. 
CRS significantly increased MDA levels in the liver relative to unstressed rats ( P ≤ 0.05, F (3, 20) = 4.854). 
Agomelatine significantly reduced MDA levels ( P ≤ 0.05, F (3, 20) = 4.854), whereas fluoxetine produced a 
non-significant reduction in the levels of MDA. Furthermore, the antioxidant markers; GSH level and SOD 
activity were significantly reduced during CRS relative to control ( P ≤ 0.01, F (3, 20) = 4.928, and P ≤ 0.05, F (3, 
20) = 3.948, respectively), these changes were mitigated after fluoxetine or agomelatine administration, however, 
the effect was not significant (Fig. 6).
Effect of fluoxetine and agomelatine on liver histology in CRS rats
The stained liver sections from control rats showed normal control liver with normal classic hepatic lobules 
and portal areas, while the liver section from the CRS rat showed leukocyte infiltration. In addition, the sizes 
of the hepatocytes and their nuclei were reduced as nuclei appeared more closely spaced. The spaces between 
hepatocytes (sinusoids) were blood-filled and appeared distended and some pyknotic (dark) nuclei were 
also present. The liver section from CRS rats that received fluoxetine or agomelatine revealed almost normal 
hepatocytes and hepatic lobules between regenerated portal areas with no leukocyte infiltration. Figure  7 
represents the effect of CRS on liver histology and after interventions.
Effect of Fluoxetine and agomelatine on the liver expression of caspase 3 and PCNA in CRS 
rats
Caspase 3
The cell death and proliferation responses were investigated in liver tissue using caspase 3 immunostaining. 
Liver sections from rats that received normal saline showed normal immunoreactive signals of caspase 3. On the 
contrary, liver sections from CRS rats showed strongly positive immune reactivity in comparison to controls. 
Fluoxetine or agomelatine administration during CRS mitigated the upregulation of caspase 3 protein expression 
and normalized it to a control group level (***P < 0.001, F (3, 20) = 32.10, Fig. 8).
PCNA
The hepatic cell proliferation response was assessed using PCNA immunostaining. Liver sections from rats that 
received normal saline showed normal immunoreactive signal and PCNA. In contrast, liver sections from CRS 
rats showed a strongly positive immune reactivity signal relative to controls. The use of fluoxetine or agomelatine 
during CRS reversed the increase in PCNA protein expression after CRS exposure (***P < 0.001, F (3, 20) = 56.98, 
Fig. 9).
Discussion
Chronic stress has a profound negative impact on liver health and function. Patients with NAFLD exhibit 
high rates of depression, anxiety, and stress 13. Depression is particularly prevalent in patients with chronic 
liver diseases, with shared underlying mechanisms involving inflammation and stress 51. It is established that

chronic stress is one of the causative factors of depression. There is a growing recognition of the bidirectional 
relationship between mental health and peripheral organ function, particularly the liver. Chronic liver disease 
and hepatic inflammation are frequently accompanied by depressive symptoms, fatigue, and social withdrawal, 
suggesting that liver pathology may actively contribute to neuropsychiatric manifestations rather than being 
a mere consequence of brain dysfunction 52,53. While numerous studies have explored hippocampal and other 
brain changes in depression models, there is a relative paucity of research examining the hepatic consequences 
of chronic stress and antidepressant treatment. Our study addresses this gap by providing novel insights into the 
peripheral effects of depression and its treatments, specifically focusing on the liver.
Accordingly, the CRS model in rats was used to resemble some anhedonic and hepatic alterations of depression 
and to investigate underlying mechanisms. CRS is a well-known model of stress-induced depression in rodents. 
CRS is a robustly validated depression model that emphasizes predictable chronic stress exposure via one simple 
and easily reproducible procedure37. The CRS has been shown to recapitulate depression phenotypes in rodents, 
such as body weight loss, despair, and anhedonia 38,54–57. Herein, we examine oxidative stress, apoptosis, and

regenerative capacity in hepatic tissue to elucidate the peripheral biological changes that may precede or drive 
central neurobiological alterations in depression and anhedonia.
Our results confirmed that the CRS rat model was established, as indicated by the significant decrease in 
body weight gain, increased immobility in FST, and numerically reduced sucrose solution consumption while 
performing the SPT. The reduction in sucrose consumption did not reach significance due to variability in 
CRS duration, test intensity, methodological inconsistencies, and SPT protocols 58,59. The protocol variability 
in habituation and deprivation methods may explain inconsistent findings regarding the effects of CS on 
sucrose consumption60,61. This highlighted the need for detailed testing protocols and experimental design. In 
addition, measuring the sucrose consumption in a group of rats, not individually, may influence the significance. 
Measuring sucrose preference at the cage (group) level may mask individual variability and reduce the sensitivity 
to detect small differences between experimental groups. However, housing animals individually to assess 
sucrose consumption also presents challenges. While individual housing eliminates the confounding effects of 
dominance hierarchies and social influences on sucrose drinking behavior, it can introduce other confounding 
factors, notably, social isolation. Social isolation is known to increase stress and depressive-like behaviors in 
rats, particularly when it is prolonged, as in the 20-hour sucrose preference assay. This additional stressor could 
confound the effects of CRS and influence the interpretation of the results. Given these reasons, both group 
and individual housing approaches have limitations. Future studies are recommended to directly compare 
group versus individual sucrose consumption measurements and determine the most reliable and valid method 
for assessing anhedonia in this model. Furthermore, we minimized sucrose neophobia and side preference in 
the experimental design by following the recommended procedure. Of note, previous studies on CS in rodent 
models have yielded mixed results regarding the impact of CS on sucrose preference. While a marked reduction 
in sucrose consumption was seen in mice 40,62. Recent systematic research indicated that some CS-induced 
depression in rodents exhibited significant variability, leading to inconsistent behavioral results, including the 
SPT63.
In the current study, the antidepressant agomelatine did not reverse the weight reduction, but its outcomes 
were better than those of fluoxetine. It has been demonstrated that high doses of agomelatine increased food 
intake and body weight, counteracting the effects of restraint stress in mice, which is often linked to depressive

effect is not well understood and needs further investigation.
Regarding the effect of agomelatine on depression phenotypes, anhedonia, and despair, we demonstrated 
that agomelatine and fluoxetine slightly increased sucrose consumption, but their effects on FST were more 
significant as they decreased immobility score and increased climbing score, indicating reduced despair-like

behavior in stressed rats. Agomelatine has shown antidepressant activity in several animal models of depression, 
such as chronic mild stress, forced swimming, and psychosocial stress, and its effectiveness was comparable 
to traditional antidepressants like imipramine and fluoxetine 66–68. In CRS, agomelatine administration has 
been shown to alleviate depressive-like behaviors, as evidenced by improved performance in the FST 69. The 
positive effect of agomelatine on depression phenotypes was consistent with the FST findings from previous 
studies that employed chronic constant light model70 and unpredictable CMS model71. This may be attributed to

agomelatine’s ability to promote neurogenesis and restore normal neuronal activity in stressed rats72, suggesting 
neuroprotective action.
In this work, we assessed the effect of CRS on liver transaminases, ALT, and AST. The activity of these enzymes 
in the blood is usually proportional to the severity and cause of liver injury. ALT is a more precise biomarker 
for liver injury, but other enzymes, such as AST, are less specific to liver injury, as they also rise with heart or 
kidney injury73. CRS has been shown to influence liver function, indicated by elevations in liver transaminases, 
although these changes did not reach statistical significance. Research has demonstrated that CS can induce 
subtle, non-clinical increases in biochemical liver parameters, including ALT and AST. Of greater concern, 
CS may contribute to the progression of liver diseases such as NAFLD 15,74. The liver is capable of adapting 
to stress-induced changes in liver enzymes. Our findings suggested that the liver might initially respond to 
CRS by increasing liver enzyme levels. However, these levels might gradually decrease over 5 weeks of CRS as 
the liver attempts to restore homeostasis. This hypothesis aligns with previous research demonstrating that the 
return of corticosterone levels to baseline in chronically stressed rats indicates a potential adaptive response 
to prolonged stress75. Indeed, the overall impact of CS on liver transaminases remains complex, necessitating 
further investigation.
On the other hand, agomelatine failed to ameliorate the CRS-induced elevation in ALT level significantly, 
and no significant difference was observed in ALT activity between CRS and CRS + agomelatine groups. 
This might be related to the used dose, as the incidence of enzyme elevation after agomelatine consumption 
is dose-dependent76, and could be linked to gene polymorphism in CYP1A2, the main metabolic enzyme of 
agomelatine77.
Regarding oxidative stress, chronic stress has been linked to liver injury through mechanisms involving the 
gut microbiota and the activation of the HPA, which can exacerbate liver conditions11,12. Activation of the HPA 
axis and subsequent cortisol release can elevate oxidative stress in the liver. This increase in oxidative stress leads 
to a surplus of free radicals, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), overwhelming the liver’s antioxidant capacity 
and consequently impairing its detoxification function. CRS caused hepatic imbalance in oxidant/antioxidant 
markers, as evidenced by significantly elevated MDA level but decreased GSH level and SOD activity. MDA is 
one of the final products of the peroxidation process of cell membrane lipids, it is generally considered the most 
sensitive indicator of oxidative stress. This is because MDA is a direct product of lipid peroxidation, which is 
a major cause of oxidative damage. SOD and GSH are important antioxidants, but they can also be affected by 
other factors besides oxidative stress. A previous study reported a positive correlation between corticosterone 
and liver MDA 75. Some previous studies reported that 21 days of CRS caused similar alterations in oxidant/ 
antioxidant markers78,79. Other studies utilizing CMS have been shown to induce oxidative stress in the liver, 
characterized by increased levels of ROS and MDA, alongside decreased activity of antioxidant enzymes like 
glutathione peroxidase and catalase29,80.
Herein, agomelatine has antioxidant effects by significantly reducing MDA in CRS rats. Additionally, the 
antioxidants GSH and SOD were increased with agomelatine treatment, although to a lesser extent than the 
reduction in MDA. The dose of agomelatine in this study has a more pronounced effect on lipid peroxidation, 
as indicated by the significant decrease in MDA, a primary marker of oxidative stress. While agomelatine also 
positively influences antioxidant markers like GSH and SOD, its impact on lipid peroxidation may be more 
substantial. Agomelatine exerts hepatoprotective effects by decreasing MDA and increasing antioxidants like 
SOD and GSH in liver tissue after CMS 29 paracetamol acute toxicity 30 or after partial hepatectomy 81. Besides 
that, it reversed oxidative stress induced by cisplatin toxicity in the liver and kidney; however, this effect was 
observed with a dose of 20 mg/kg but not 40 mg/kg 31. It also showed positive effects in CRS rats by enhancing 
catalase activity and halting oxidative stress 82. The antioxidant and hepatoprotective effects of agomelatine are 
related to its activation of melatonin receptors, which upregulate antioxidant expression83,84. In addition, it may 
exert its antioxidant effects by activating melatonin receptors, which scavenge ROS and promote antioxidant 
activity85, or by modulating the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) 
signaling pathway86,87. This pathway is a crucial cellular defense mechanism against various stressors, primarily 
oxidative stress, but also inflammation and other cellular insults.
The liver, despite its remarkable regenerative capacity, is particularly susceptible to stress-induced injury. 
This vulnerability stems from its primary role as a metabolic and detoxification organ, making it the first line of 
defense against various toxins and stressors, especially after chronic exposure. Here, we utilized H&E staining 
to evaluate the impact of CRS on liver tissue architecture. Consistent with the biochemical evidence of oxidative 
stress, the liver histopathological results revealed signs of hepatic congestion and more leukocytes infiltrating 
the liver tissue. Additionally, hepatocytes displayed reduced cell and nuclear size, with nuclei appearing more 
densely packed. Pyknotic nuclei, indicative of cell death, were also present. In support of such results, Xu et al. 
reported that the use of an unpredictable CMS model caused inflammatory cell infiltration and degeneration of 
hepatocytes12. Besides that, others reported that high-stress model cold exposure, immobilization, and starvation 
showed hepatic parenchymal vacuolization, necrosis, hemorrhage, cell infiltration, sinusoidal dilatation, and 
pyknotic nuclei85. These histopathological alterations may be attributed to the generation of ROS and oxidative 
stress, hepatic inflammation, and impaired fatty acid oxidation88,89. CRS can trigger the overproduction of ROS, 
such as hydroxyl radicals and superoxide anions. These highly reactive molecules with unpaired electrons can 
disrupt cellular components like lipids, proteins, and DNA, leading to cell death and abnormal liver architecture. 
Furthermore, the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines may further increase hepatic histological changes15,89.
Alongside the histological findings and to further investigate the cellular response to CRS, we assessed the 
expression of caspase-3 and PCNA, two key markers of cell death and regeneration, respectively. Our results 
indicated that CRS induces hepatocyte turnover as a stress response, characterized by increased expression of 
both proteins. Caspase-3 is a crucial executioner caspase involved in programmed cell death (apoptosis), while 
PCNA is a protein involved in DNA replication and cell cycle progression, essential for cell proliferation. Our

www.nature.com/scientificreports/
findings indicate that, although CRS triggers hepatic cell death, the liver retains its regenerative capacity. This 
novel observation has not been previously reported which such stress model. Following CRS exposure, the liver 
responded by initiating apoptosis in damaged cells. Caspase-3 can facilitate the efficient clearance of these cells, 
a process known as ‘apoptotic clearance’90,91. Subsequently, PCNA expression increases in hepatocytes as they 
enter the cell cycle and divide to regenerate lost liver tissue. PCNA levels can serve as a marker for assessing 
liver regenerative capacity92. This delicate balance between hepatocyte apoptosis and proliferation is crucial for 
maintaining liver homeostasis during regeneration93.
The interplay between oxidative stress, inflammation, and apoptosis forms a critical triad in the pathogenesis 
of stress-induced hepatic injury. Our data suggest that oxidative stress plays a central role in the hepatic 
alterations observed following CRS. Elevated hepatic MDA levels and reduced levels of GSH and SOD activity 
indicate enhanced lipid peroxidation and compromised antioxidant defense. These findings are consistent 
with prior evidence showing that activation of the HPA axis under chronic stress conditions leads to excessive 
ROS production, contributing to cellular damage in peripheral organs, including the liver 12,52. It has also been 
demonstrated that stress leads to a reduction in hepatic blood flow, which is mediated by the hypothalamus–
hepatic sympathetic nerve–norepinephrine axis and hypothalamus–adrenal medulla–epinephrine axis 94. 
Hypoxia in hepatic tissue aggravates the production of ROS, leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress and cell 
death95. This stress-mediated hypoxic condition hinders the oxidative phosphorylation, leading to a depletion in 
ATP production and subsequently to necrotic changes and increased severity of liver injury96.
In addition, hypoxic conditions release various tissue-derived inflammatory mediators, which are followed 
by the recruitment of macrophages, resulting in inflammatory injury 97. Furthermore, oxidative stress can also 
lead to the overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines that induce the infiltration of inflammatory cells (as 
observed by H&E staining in our study). These inflammatory cells produce more ROS, which exacerbates the 
oxidative stress as well as triggers inflammation and hepatic cell death98. Moreover, the stress‐induced increase 
in gut permeability augments the influx of gut‐derived lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and alien substances into the 
liver99. This over ‐influx of LPS leads to liver inflammation, and the increased levels of alien substances easily 
damage the liver100.
Oxidative stress is closely linked to apoptotic signaling. The observed upregulation of caspase-3 in CRS rats 
suggests the activation of intrinsic apoptotic pathways, potentially driven by mitochondrial dysfunction and ROS 
accumulation. Additionally, stress-induced ROS can impair mitochondrial membrane potential and promote 
cytochrome c release, further amplifying caspase cascade activation. Simultaneously, increased expression 
of PCNA indicates enhanced hepatocyte turnover, likely reflecting a compensatory regenerative response to 
oxidative and apoptotic insults. This balance between cell death and proliferation is critical for maintaining 
hepatic homeostasis under stress.
Agomelatine administration attenuated oxidative stress markers, attenuated the inflammatory cell infiltration, 
and reduced the expression of both caspase-3 and PCNA. The normalization of these molecular markers 
suggests that agomelatine may modulate oxidative and apoptotic stress while preserving regenerative capacity 
in hepatic tissue exposed to CRS. The protective effects of agomelatine mirror its known anti-inflammatory and 
antioxidative properties observed in other organ systems. As far as we know, this work revealed for the first time 
that agomelatine improved liver histopathology changes associated with CRS and restored normal expression 
of caspase 3 and PCNA. These positive effects were reported in other disease or toxicity models; for example, 
Cankara et al. showed that agomelatine decreases liver histopathological alterations such as liver necrosis, 
inflammation and congestion that occurred after cisplatin exposure 31. Agomelatine was reported to decrease 
the number of Ki-67, another cell proliferation marker, after partial hepatectomy 81. In paracetamol-induced 
liver injury, agomelatine was revealed to enhance hepatic regeneration, evidenced by binucleated hepatocytes, 
indicating more cell proliferation and potential for liver regeneration 30. Notably, these effects were seen with 
18 mg/kg dose, which was within the level of therapeutic doses. Higher doses of this drug can show negative 
effects on the liver31.
The findings from this study have important clinical implications, particularly in the context of the growing 
recognition of the bidirectional relationship between chronic stress, depression, and liver health. Chronic 
stress is not only a major risk factor for the development and exacerbation of psychiatric disorders such as 
depression, but it is also increasingly recognized as a contributor to liver pathology, including NAFLD and 
hepatic inflammation 13. The observed attenuation of oxidative stress and histopathological changes in the 
liver by agomelatine in the CRS rat model suggests a potential therapeutic benefit for patients suffering from 
comorbid depression and liver dysfunction. Future clinical studies are warranted to investigate the effects of 
agomelatine on liver function and structure in patients with chronic stress or depression, particularly those with 
comorbid metabolic or liver diseases. Understanding how these drugs alter the liver under stress conditions is 
crucial for optimizing clinical care.
While this study successfully achieved its aims and objectives, it is important to acknowledge certain 
limitations. The relatively small sample size may have limited our ability to detect statistically significant 
variations between the study groups, even in the presence of true effects. Future studies with larger sample sizes 
are essential to increase statistical power. Measuring inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-
alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) would provide additional insights into 
the connection between stress-induced depression, inflammation, and liver changes. Assessing the expression 
of stress-related genes such as glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) and hypocretin/orexin (HCRT) can further 
elucidate the molecular mechanisms linking depression and liver dysfunction. Additionally, frequent blood 
sampling to monitor liver enzymes and corticosterone levels throughout the experimental period would offer 
valuable data on the time-dependent effects of CRS on liver function. Correlating corticosterone levels with 
changes in liver enzymes and oxidative markers like MDA would further elucidate the dynamic relationship

between stress and liver changes. Subsequent studies could investigate the long-term impact of agomelatine on 
the liver by extending treatment durations and using different doses.
Conclusion
This study revealed for the first time the potential therapeutic role of antidepressants, fluoxetine and agomelatine, 
in liver damage that occurs during the CRS depression model. These drugs highlight the intricate link between 
mental health and liver function by regulating mood, reducing oxidative stress, and promoting liver regeneration. 
Future research is needed to elucidate the underlying mechanisms of fluoxetine and agomelatine in the liver and 
to assess their long-term efficacy and safety in this context.
