Abstract
Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive and heterogeneous subtype of breast cancer with poor 
clinical outcomes. Malic enzyme 2 (ME2) is a mitochondrial enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of malate to 
pyruvate and has been proposed as a therapeutic target. ME2 is highly expressed in many cell types including 
TNBC cells. We sought to define the molecular and cellular consequences of ME2 inhibition to facilitate its clinical 
translation. Here, we systematically evaluated the cellular and molecular effects of ME2 knockdown (ME2kd) in 
multiple TNBC models. ME2kd had heterogeneous effects on proliferation, migration, and metabolic flexibility in 
TNBC cell lines. ME2kd MDA-MB-468 xenografts in nude mice grew significantly slower and conferred prolonged 
host survival. ME2kd caused distinct shifts in mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis, whereas metabolomic and 
transcriptomic analyses revealed altered tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux, glutamine consumption, and serine/
glycine metabolism, partly through changes in malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS) activity. The interplay between ME2, 
the serine synthesis pathway and the MAS was investigated with metabolite deprivation and co-knockdown assays. 
Importantly, we determined the crystal structure of ME2 bound to the small-molecule inhibitor NPD-389 and 
identified the binding interactions that drive the inhibitory response. These findings help to clarify the role of ME2 
in TNBC phenotypes and highlight the therapeutic potential of ME2 inhibition in precision oncology.

Introduction
Breast cancer is a prominent contributor to the global 
burden of cancer, causing 30% of cancers and being the 
second cause of deaths from cancer in women. Triple-
negative breast cancer (TNBC), which lacks expression 
of ER/PR and does not overexpress HER2, is an aggres -
sive, diverse subtype that comprises ~ 10–15% of cases, 
and is associated with poor prognosis due to high meta -
static potential and limited treatments.
Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of cancer and 
alterations in cellular metabolism support rapid cell 
growth and proliferation. Shifts in metabolic pathway 
activities can render cancer cells vulnerable to metabolic 
enzyme inhibition, thus identifying potential therapeutic 
targets [1]. The inhibition of specific metabolic enzymes 
has shown promise in disrupting the metabolic plastic -
ity that may be essential for cancer cell survival, espe -
cially when under stress from anti-cancer therapies [2, 3]. 
However, this approach remains challenging owing to the 
interpatient variability in tumor metabolite reliance.
Malic enzyme 2 (ME2) is one of three known isoforms 
of malic enzyme (ME1, ME2, and ME3), and one of two 
mitochondrial isoforms (ME2 and ME3). A major func -
tion of the malic enzymes is to convert malate to pyru -
vate, serving as a metabolic shunt to regulate TCA cycle 
activity under fluctuating external stresses. However, 
more recently, ME2 has gained more attention for its role 
in regulating energy metabolism and redox homeostasis 
via the conversion of NAD(P) + to NAD(P)H [ 4, 5]. Fur-
thermore, several papers have started to bring attention 
to ME2’s role in regulating the redox balance not only 
within the mitochondria, but also between the mitochon-
dria and the cytosol through glycolysis [ 6–8]. Due to this 
flexible and comprehensive role, ME2 has increasingly 
become of interest in cancer as a potential therapeutic 
target [4].
The de novo serine synthesis pathway (SSP) is tightly 
linked to the interplay between mitochondrial and cyto -
solic redox and energy metabolism. We were particularly 
interested in this pathway due to its well-established 
role in many breast cancers, as well as its dependence 
on redox balance and its association with the mitochon -
dria, both of which are characteristics closely linked 
to ME2 activity [ 9–11]. Serine is biosynthesized via the 
SSP , branching from glycolysis in the cytosol. The SSP 
contributes to one-carbon metabolism of the folate and 
methionine cycle across the mitochondria and cytosol 
to produce purines and glutathione for proliferation and 
redox regulation, respectively. For this reason, the pro -
duction of serine is tightly regulated by phosphoglycerate 
dehydrogenase (PHGDH) which utilizes NAD +, and by 
TCA metabolites such as glutamate and α-ketoglutarate 
through phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1). The 
SSP is known to play a significant role in many breast 
cancers, with certain subsets having elevated levels of 
PHGDH expression [ 12, 13]. This has led SSP to be of 
high interest for therapeutic targeting [14, 15].
The mechanism by which SSP regulates NAD(P)H lev -
els across the mitochondria is via the folate cycle, with the 
forward reaction increasing NADH and NADP + levels in 
the mitochondria and cytosol, respectively [16, 17]. How-
ever, Broeks et al. recently discovered that the malate-
aspartate shuttle (MAS) is important for SSP function 
through regulation of the NAD+/NADH ratio [18]. In this 
scenario, MAS effectively shuttles malate from the mito -
chondria to the cytosol by converting NAD + to NADH 
in the mitochondria, and NADH to NAD + in the cyto -
sol. This leads to a redox-equivalent export of NAD + to 
the cytosol and import of NADH into the mitochondria. 
Ultimately, the resulting increase in cytosolic NADH can 
lead to the inhibition of glycolytic flux and an increase in 
SSP flux [ 18, 19]. Regulation of energy metabolism and

redox balance between the cytosol and mitochondrial by 
the MAS has been shown to increase drug resistance in 
certain cancer cells and has made it a target of therapeu -
tic interest for many cancers [19, 20].
In this study, we show that ME2 plays a significant 
role in regulating glycolytic and SSP flux via the MAS in 
TNBC cell lines. We evaluate ME2 knockdown (ME2kd) 
in TNBC models, explore how ME2 inhibition disrupts 
cancer metabolism, and identify predictive response 
pathways. By investigating the direct and indirect effects 
of ME2 activity on cell growth and the rewiring of met -
abolic profiles, we sought to elucidate its role in TNBC 
and identify predictive markers for ME2kd as a thera -
peutic strategy. We characterized TNBC and control 
cell lines in vitro and in vivo for proliferation, migration, 
apoptotic activity, and metabolic transcriptome changes 
in response to ME2kd. We performed detailed metabolite 
analyses using mass spectrometry, showing that mito -
chondrial function is impaired, and present data support-
ing the alternative utilization of the SSP and MAS under 
ME2kd. We present a novel crystal structure of ME2 
bound to the malic enzyme inhibitor NPD-389, reveal -
ing detailed enzyme-compound interactions, providing a 
structural rationale and platform for designing new ME2-
targeting molecules.
Materials and methods
ME2 correlation with genes in Serine metabolic pathway
Transcriptomic analysis was performed on a subset of 
samples (only TNBC) from the Breast Invasive Carci -
noma dataset generated by Ciriello et al. from cBioPortal 
[21–23], which was determined by a lack of estrogen and 
progesterone receptor expression and clinically nega -
tive HER2 expression. In other words, we selected only 
samples with negative entries for “ER status by IHC” , 
“PR status by IHC” and “HER2 FISH status” in the clini -
cal data file. Next, we performed a Pearson correlation 
test between the malic enzyme paralogs (ME1, ME2, 
and ME3) and genes associated with serine and glycine 
metabolism. All analyses were performed using Python, 
version 3.11.4.
Cell Lines, culture conditions and SiRNA transfection
TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-468, RRID: CVCL_0419; 
Hs578T, RRID: CVCL_0332; HCC1806, RRID: 
CVCL_1258; HCC70, RRID: CVCL_1270; and BT-20, 
RRID: CVCL_0178) and a non-tumorigenic breast cell 
line (MCF10a, RRID: CVCL_0598) were used for com -
parative analysis. All cell lines used in this study were 
purchased from ATCC. Cell line identities were verified 
by STR profiling (ATCC) and routinely tested for myco -
plasma contamination using MycoAlert Mycoplasma 
Detection Kit (Lonza). MDA-MB-468 and Hs578T were 
cultured in high glucose DMEM (Corning) supplemented 
with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 1% antibiotic-anti -
mycotic (Gibco), and 0.05% gentamicin. HCC1806 and 
HCC70 were cultured in RPMI-1640 (ATCC) with 10% 
FBS, 1% penicillin/streptomycin, and 0.05% gentamicin. 
BT-20 cells were cultured in EMEM with Earle’s salts 
(Corning), 10% FBS, 1% antibiotic-antimycotic, and 0.05% 
gentamicin. MCF10a cells were cultured in DMEM/F12 
(Corning) with 5% horse serum, 1% penicillin/strep -
tomycin, 1% amphotericin B, 0.05% gentamicin, 5 µg/
ml insulin, 1 µg/ml hydrocortisone, 20ng/ml epidermal 
growth factor, and 100 µg/ml cholera toxin. All cell lines 
were cultured in a humidified atmosphere at 37 °C and 
5% CO 2. For experiments in the BioTek BioSpa 8 auto -
mated incubator, cells were maintained at 37 °C with 10% 
CO2. ME2-targeting and negative control siRNAs were 
purchased from Integrated DNA Technologies. Reverse 
transfection was performed using RNAiMAX (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific) in a 48-well plate at 50% confluence.
Lentiviral transduction
Lentiviral transfer plasmids carrying either scrambled 
shRNA or ME2-targeting shRNA with co-expression of 
TurboRFP were purchased from Horizon Discovery. The 
lentivirus was prepared at the University of Michigan 
viral vector core using a third-generation propagation 
system. Transduction was performed in subconfluent 
cell cultures for 72 h. Expression of scrambled or ME2-
targeting shRNA was induced by adding doxycycline 
(Sigma; 0.125 µg/ml) to the culture medium. Positive 
cells were identified by TurboRFP fluorescence; cell sort -
ing to remove unmodified cells was performed using the 
NanoCellect WOLFG2 cell sorter.
Confirmation of ME2 knockdown
For cells in culture and post-extraction tumors, knock -
down efficiency was assessed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) 
with ME2-specific primers and western blot analysis. For 
qPCR, total RNA was extracted using DirectZol RNA 
Microprep (Zymo Research) and cDNA was synthesized 
using the High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription 
Kit (Applied Biosystems). Transcript analysis was per -
formed using the Applied Biosystems QuantStudio 3. 
ME2 protein levels were quantified by western blotting 
using antibodies specific to ME2 and beta-actin (Cell 
Signaling) and detected with an Azure Biosystems c300 
imager.
Growth rate Analysis, donut and caspase 3/7 assay
Cell proliferation was measured in a Biotek BioSpa 8 
automated incubator using an Agilent Cytation 5 multi-
mode reader. Cells were plated in 24-well plates and 
growth rates were monitored over a period of 72 h post-
transfection of ME2 knockdown by siRNA. The cell num-
ber was quantified at each time point using the Cellpose

2.0 segmentation algorithm after training specific to each 
cell line (cellpose.org). Donut assays were performed in 
96-well black-walled Nunc plates (Thermo Fisher Scien -
tific) using Oris stoppers (Platypus Technologies). Cells 
were seeded to obtain 100% confluency after 24 h, at 
which point stoppers were removed, and migration was 
assessed over 72 h. Caspase-3/7 activity was measured 
using CellEvent Caspase-3/7 Green Detection Reagent 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) to assess apoptosis following 
ME2 knockdown. Cells were seeded in 96-well plates at a 
density of 5 × 10⁴ cells per well in doxycycline-containing 
medium (125 ng/mL doxycycline). After 48 h, the Cel -
lEvent Caspase-3/7 reagent was added directly to the 
culture medium at a final concentration of 5 µM. After 
a 30-minute incubation at 37 °C, 5% CO₂, fluorescence 
was measured using a microplate reader and visualized 
via fluorescence microscopy, comparing scrambled to 
ME2kd. The fluorescence intensity was normalized to 
the total number of cells based on the TurboRFP signal. 
Background fluorescence was determined using cells 
that did not receive the reagents. All experiments were 
performed in triplicate, and statistical significance was 
assessed using a two-tailed Student’s t-test or ANOVA, 
where appropriate.
Metabolomic transcriptome panels
The NanoString nCounter Metabolic Pathways Panel was 
used to analyze the expression of genes involved in vari -
ous metabolic pathways in TNBC and control cell lines. 
For each sample, 100 ng of total RNA was hybridized 
with the nCounter® Metabolic Pathways Panel CodeSet at 
65 °C for 20 h. After hybridization, the samples were pro-
cessed using the nCounter® Prep Station, and data were 
collected using the nCounter® Digital Analyzer. Tran -
script counts were analyzed using Rosalind (nanostring.
rosalind.bio) and nSolver (NanoString).
TNBC xenografts in nude mice
Female athymic nude mice, aged 6–8 weeks, were pur -
chased from Charles River Laboratories. Mice were 
housed under pathogen-free conditions with a 12-hour 
light/dark cycle and provided with autoclaved food and 
doxycycline-containing water (400 µg/mL doxycycline, 
2% sucrose) ad libitum. Mice were anesthetized with 
a solution of ketamine/xylazine (0.1 mg/0.01 mg per 
1 g of body weight prior to the administration of can -
cer cells. For each mouse, 100 µL of the cell suspension 
was injected subcutaneously into the left flank; HCC70 
suspensions contained 1 × 10 6 cells and MDA-MB-468 
suspensions contained 1.5 × 106 cells. Four groups of 10 
mice were established, with each group receiving either 
a cell line expressing scrambled shRNA or ME2-target -
ing shRNA. All animal procedures were approved by the 
University of Michigan Institutional Animal Care and 
Use Committee (IACUC) and were performed in accor -
dance with institutional guidelines.
Gas Chromatography-Mass spectrometry and metabolite 
quantification
Both scrambled and ME2 knockdown cell lines were 
treated with 125 ng/mL doxycycline in their respective 
media for 48 h. Following treatment, cells were washed 
three times with PBS and then cultured in either com -
plete RPMI-1640 medium (supplemented with 10% FBS, 
100 U/mL Pen-Strep, and 125 ng/mL doxycycline) or 
serine- and glycine-deprived RPMI-1640 medium con -
taining 11.11 mM U- 13C6-labeled D-glucose for 24 h 
(supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS, 100 U/mL Pen-
Strep, and 125 ng/mL doxycycline).
Metabolites were harvested by adding a mixture of 
methanol and distilled water (1:1, v/v) directly to the 
cells. The samples were phase-separated by adding an 
equal volume of chloroform. The polar (upper) aque -
ous layer was isolated and dried overnight at 4 °C using 
a SpeedVac concentrator. Dried metabolites were first 
derivatized with 2% methoxamine (MOX) in pyridine at 
45 °C for 1 h, followed by a second derivatization step 
with N-methyl-N-(t-butyldimethylsilyl)-trifluoroacet -
amide (MTBSTFA) containing 1% t-butyldimethylchlo -
rosilane (t-BDMCS) at 45 °C for 30 min.
Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) 
analysis was conducted using helium as the carrier gas 
flowing at 1 mL/min. The injection volume ranged from 
1 to 2 µL, with the inlet temperature set at 270 °C. The 
oven temperature was held at 100 °C for 11 min, then 
ramped at 3.5 °C/min to 255 °C, followed by an increase 
to 320 °C at 15 °C/min and held for an additional 3 min. 
A solvent delay of 6–10 min was used. The MS ion source 
and quadrupole temperatures were set at 230 °C and 150 
°C, respectively. The mass spectrometer was operated in 
the scan mode (70–600 m/z). Metabolite concentrations 
were quantified based on standard curves generated con -
currently with the experimental samples. All measured 
metabolite concentrations were normalized to the pro -
tein content of cells cultured under identical conditions, 
as determined by BCA protein assay. Isotopic enrich -
ment was corrected for natural isotope abundance using 
IsoCorrectoR before further analysis. Labeling was quan -
tified both as mean enrichment and as mass isotopologue 
distributions (MIDs). Mean enrichment is reported in 
the main figures; complete MIDs are presented in Sup -
plementary Figures S5 and S6.
Additionally, intracellular concentrations of critical 
metabolites, including malate, glutamate, NAD +, NADH, 
NADP+, and NADPH, were quantified using Metabolite-
Glo assay kits (Promega), according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions.

Seahorse assay
Cellular metabolic activity was measured using an XFe96 
extracellular flux analyzer (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, 
USA). Both scrambled control and ME2 knockdown cell 
lines were treated with 125 ng/mL doxycycline for 48 h 
prior to seeding. The cells were then seeded into XFe96 
cell culture plates at optimized densities: MDA-MB-468, 
40,000 cells/well; BT-20, 20,000 cells/well, HCC70, 
30,000 cells/well; Hs578T, 20,000 cells/well; HCC1806, 
20,000 cells/well; and MCF10a, 20,000 cells/well. The 
cells were cultured in media containing 125 ng/mL doxy -
cycline and incubated at 37 °C with 5% CO₂ for an addi -
tional 24 h to allow proper adherence and stabilization 
prior to analysis.
Mitostress test (MST)
After 24-hour incubation, media was replaced with 180 
µL/well of XF RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 10 
mM glucose, 1 mM pyruvate, 2 mM L-glutamine and was 
left to stabilize in a non-CO2 37 °C incubator for an addi-
tional 1 h prior to running the experiment. Oligomycin 
targeting a final concentration of 1.5 µM, FCCP target -
ing a final concentration of 1.0 ~ 2.0 µM, and Rotenone/
Antimycin A targeting a final concentration of 0.5 µM 
were added to ports A, B, and C, respectively. Final mea -
surement values were normalized to the relative Hoechst 
33,342 signals normalized to each scrambled cell line.
Glycolysis stress test (GST)
Following the initial 24-hour incubation, the medium 
was replaced with 180 µL/well of XF RPMI-1640 medium 
supplemented with 2 mM L-glutamine. Cells were then 
incubated for approximately one hour at 37 °C without 
CO₂ to allow metabolic stabilization before measure -
ments. Glycolytic stress was assessed by sequential injec -
tions of 10 mM glucose (port A), 1 µM oligomycin (port 
B), and 50 mM 2-deoxyglucose (2-DG, port C). Final 
measurements were normalized to Hoechst 33,342 sig -
nals and are presented relative to their respective scram -
bled control cell lines.
Metabolite-deprived growth test
The scrambled control and ME2kd cell lines were 
seeded in 48-well plates at optimized initial densities: 
MDA-MB-468, 10,000 cells/well; HCC70, 3,500 cells/
well; HCC1806, 4,500 cells/well; Hs578T, 4,500 cells/
well; BT-20, 9,000 cells/well and MCF10a, 7,000 cells/
well. Cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5% 
CO₂ to facilitate attachment and stabilization. Media was 
replaced with one of the following experimental condi -
tions: complete RPMI-1640 containing 10 mM glucose 
(control medium), RPMI-1640 lacking serine and glycine, 
RPMI-1640 with glucose replaced by 10 mM galactose, 
or RPMI-1640 lacking serine and glycine with glucose 
replaced by 10 mM galactose. 10 mM galactose was sub -
stituted with 3 mM glucose for Hs578T and HCC1806, 
which was the minimum concentration required to sus -
tain growth in these cell lines. Each media condition was 
supplemented with 10% dialyzed FBS (dFBS), 100 U/
mL Pen-Strep, and 125 ng/mL doxycycline. Media for 
MCF10a was additionally supplemented with 0.02 µg/
mL EGF, 0.5 µg/mL hydrocortisone, 0.1 µg/mL cholera 
toxin, and 10 µg/mL insulin which are required for their 
growth. The medium was refreshed every 24 h.
Cell growth was monitored using an Agilent BioTek 
BioSpa 8 Automated Incubator and Cytation Cell Imag -
ing Reader (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA), capturing 
images at 6-hour intervals. The cell counts were normal -
ized relative to the initial cell number seeded in each well. 
For each cell line and experiment, the final growth points 
were obtained when one of the groups reached conflu -
ence (~ 4–7 days). Endpoint fold-changes were then nor -
malized within genotype: for scrambled and ME2kd cells, 
deprivation conditions were divided by that genotype’s 
complete-media control measured on the same plate.
Malic enzyme 2 and malate-aspartate shuttle 
co-knockdown growth test
Scrambled control and ME2kd cell lines were seeded in 
48-well plates at optimized densities as follows: MDA-
MB-468, 10,000 cells/well; HCC70, 3,500 cells/well; 
HCC1806, 4,500 cells/well; Hs578T 4,500 cells/well; 
BT-20, 9,000 cells/well; and MCF10a, 7,000 cells/well. 
Cells were incubated overnight at 37 °C with 5% CO₂ to 
allow for attachment and stabilization.
Following overnight stabilization, the cells were trans -
fected with siRNA targeting SLC25A13, the major 
transporter in the MAS (MAS knockdown, MASkd) or 
negative control siRNA purchased from Integrated DNA 
Technologies (Coralville, IA, USA). Transfections were 
performed in 48-well plates using Opti-MEM and Lipo -
fectamine RNAiMAX reagent (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 
utilizing half of the manufacturer’s recommended vol -
ume adjusted appropriately for the 48-well plate condi -
tions. Transfection medium was replaced after 24 h with 
fresh RPMI-1640 medium supplemented with 100 U/mL 
penicillin-streptomycin, 10% dialyzed fetal bovine serum 
(dFBS), and 125 ng/mL doxycycline.
Cell growth was continuously monitored and imaged 
using an Agilent BioTek BioSpa 8 Automated Incuba -
tor paired with a Cytation Cell Imaging Reader (Agilent, 
Santa Clara, CA, USA), capturing images at 6-hour inter -
vals. For each cell line and experiment, the final growth 
points were obtained when one of the groups reached 
confluence (~ 4–9 days). Cell counts from these images 
were initially normalized to the starting cell number

per well, and subsequently to the counts obtained from 
scrambled control cells transfected with negative control 
siRNA under identical experimental conditions.
 Expression and purification of ME2
An ME2 construct comprising amino acids 19–584 (Uni -
Prot: P23368) incorporating a C-terminal hexa-histidine 
tag, was custom synthesized and cloned into a pProEX-
HTb plasmid (Genscript) that was transformed into 
Escherichia coli  BL21 (LOBSTR) cells. E. coli  cells were 
grown at 37 °C in 2YT medium supplemented with 100 
µg mL −1 ampicillin and with shaking at 180 rpm, to an 
OD600 of 0.8 before incubation at 18 °C and induc -
tion with the addition of 0.25 mM isopropyl β-D-1-
thiogalactoyranoside (IPTG). The cells were harvested by 
centrifugation at 4,000 × g at 4 °C for 30 min and were 
resuspended in lysis buffer comprising 30 mM Tris-HCl 
pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl 2, 15 mM sodium 
imidazole, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol, supplemented with 
10 mg/mL lysozyme, 1 mg/mL DNase1, 1 mg/mL RNase 
H, and EDTA-free protease inhibitor mix (Roche). Cells 
were mechanically lysed at 18 KPSI using a Microfluid -
izer M-110P instrument (Brinkmann Instruments), and 
the lysate centrifuged at 18,000 × g for 30 min at 4 °C. 
The supernatant was membrane filtered (1.2 μm then 
0.45 μm, Millipore) and loaded onto a 5-mL Ni-NTA col-
umn (Protino) charged with Ni 2+ ions and equilibrated 
with lysis buffer. The column was washed with lysis buf -
fer supplemented with 50 mM imidazole until baseline 
absorbance was reached. The protein was eluted using 
a 50–400 mM imidazole gradient over 50 min, and the 
protein fractions were pooled and concentrated to 1 mL 
volume. The sample was further purified by size-exclu -
sion chromatography (SEC) using a Superdex 200 10/300 
increase column (Cytiva) equilibrated with SEC buffer 
comprising 30 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.4), 500 mM NaCl, 
10 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol. Fractions 
containing ME2 protein identified by SDS-PAGE analysis 
and western blotting were pooled and concentrated to 20 
mg mL−1 and were finally flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen 
for later use. The identity of the ME2 protein was con -
firmed using mass spectrometry (UoA Mass Spectrom -
etry Center).
X-ray crystallography
The ME2/NAD + complex was crystallized using sitting 
drop vapor diffusion in Swiss 2 drop 96 well plates. A 
0.20 µL volume of protein (in 30 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 
500 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol) 
was mixed with 0.20 µL of crystallization solution and 
placed over a 50 µL volume of crystallization solu -
tion before sealing. Crystals were grown at 291 K and 
appeared within four weeks. Crystalline rods were 
initially observed in Pact condition C4 (Molecular 
Dimensions) and JSCG + condition B3 (Molecular 
Dimensions). The microseed matrix screening protocol 
produced data quality crystals using initial hits as seed 
stocks [ 24]. The seed stock was prepared using crystals 
from the Pact condition C4 (0.1 M PCTP at pH 7.0, 25% 
w/v PEG 1500), which yielded singular plates in all subse-
quent crystallization experiments.
Diffraction quality crystals of ME2/NAD + were pre -
pared as above, but using a 0.20 µL volume of protein 
mixed with 0.25 µL of crystallization solution (0.1 M 
Bis-Tris, 0.1 M ammonium tartrate, and 20% (w/v) PEG 
3350) and 0.05 µL of ME2 crystal seed stock. ME2/NAD/
NPD-389 was crystallized identically using the same 
micro-seeding matrix screening stocks, with the addition 
of 1 mM NPD-389 (30 mM DMSO stock) to the protein 
solution and using a crystallization solution comprising 
0.1 M SPG (succinic acid, sodium phosphate monobasic 
monohydrate, glycine) and 25% (w/v) PEG 1500 (Pact 
A3; Molecular Dimensions). Crystals were cryoprotected 
in crystallization solution supplemented with 35% (v/v) 
ethylene glycol, mounted in nylon loops, and were flash 
cooled in liquid nitrogen for transportation to the Aus -
tralian Synchrotron.
X-ray diffraction data were collected on the Australian 
Synchrotron MX2 beamline and processed using XDS 
and AIMLESS [25, 26]. Structures were solved by molec -
ular replacement using MOLREP or PHASER, and PDB 
coordinates 8W24 (ME2/NAD/NPD) or 9AYI (ME2/
NAD) [ 27, 28]. Iterative model building and refinement 
used COOT, REFMAC, and Phenix-refine [ 29–31]. The 
structures were validated and deposited in the Protein 
Data Bank [ 32]. Data collection and refinement statistics 
are presented in Tables S1 and S2.
Recombinant ME2 activity assay
ME2 activity was measured by NADH generation at 340 
nm at 37 °C using a Tecan Spark plate reader. The enzyme 
reaction mixture comprised 100 nM recombinant ME2, 
10.0 mM malate, 5.0 mM fumarate, 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM 
TCEP and 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4. Initial rates were 
measured following the addition of 1.0 mM NAD +, were 
normalized to NAD + generation, and fitted to a Michae -
lis-Menten model. Morrison Ki plots were produced with 
activity normalized to an uninhibited control experi -
ment. Data analysis used the Prism 10 software (Graph -
Pad Software).
Results
ME2 negatively correlates with genes involved in de Novo 
Serine synthesis
Previous studies have demonstrated that TNBC cells 
upregulate genes involved in de novo serine synthe -
sis to sustain their rapid growth [ 33]. Moreover, the 
lack of clear therapeutic targets in TNBC has led to the

exploration of alternatives that inhibit metabolic enzymes 
such as malic enzyme 2 (ME2). Therefore, we analyzed 
TNBC datasets to determine the correlation between 
ME2 and genes affiliated with serine metabolic pathways 
[34]. We found that ME2 was negatively correlated with 
phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH), phospho -
serine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1), and phosphoserine 
phosphatase (PSPH), which are key enzymes in de novo 
serine synthesis (Fig. 1A). This lead us to hypothesize that 
inhibited ME2 expression would create collateral lethality 
in cells which rely on serine synthesis, due to the inverse 
correlation that we observed in Fig. 2A. Additionally, we 
observed a negative correlation between ME2 and other 
genes downstream of serine metabolism, including Ser -
ine Hydroxy methyltransferase 1 and 2 (SHMT1 and 
SHMT2), Glycyl-tRNA Synthetase (GARS) and Glycine 
C-Acetyltransferase (GCAT). Notably, the other malic 
enzyme paralogs, ME1 and ME3, were mostly positively 
correlated with most genes in the de novo serine synthe -
sis pathway, as well as other metabolic enzymes (Fig. S1). 
This suggested that their inhibition would be metaboli -
cally compensated, thus leading us to pursue ME2 inhibi-
tion instead.
Suppression of ME2 inhibits growth and migration in some 
TNBC cell lines
Based on our initial analysis, we hypothesized that ME2 
inhibition affects de novo serine synthesis and cellu -
lar growth rates. ME2 protein expression was knocked 
down by ME2-shRNA introduced via lentiviral vectors; 
in total, 6 doxycycline-inducible ME2-targeting shRNA 
(Horizon Biosciences) were tested in each cell line to 
determine which had the highest efficacy. We empirically 
determined that reducing the concentration of doxy -
cycline from the standard (2ug/mL) down to 0.125ug/
mL induced knockdown of ME2 via shRNA expression 
without effecting mitochondrial function (Fig. S2C). 
While ME2 expression was effectively knocked down, 
ME1 was unchanged (Fig. S2A, B) and ME3 expression 
was not detectable (data not shown). In every cell line 
tested, removal of doxycycline from the media restored 
ME2 expression to endogenous levels (data not shown). 
ME2kd resulted in variable changes in phosphoserine 
aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1) and phosphoserine phos -
phatase (PSPH) protein expression between TNBC cell 
lines (Fig. 1B). Growth assays revealed a decrease in 
proliferation of 50% for MDA-MB-468 and HCC1806 
cell lines (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the proliferation of the 
non-tumorigenic MCF10a cells was reduced by only 
25%. The remaining TNBC cell lines did not exhibit sig -
nificant growth inhibition (data not shown) compared to 
MCF10a cells, suggesting that ME2 dependency varies 
among TNBC models.
In addition to its effect on proliferation, ME2kd 
impaired the migratory capacity of TNBC cells. Donut 
assays revealed a reduction in the migratory potential 
of MDA-MB-468 and HCC1806 cells following ME2kd, 
with MCF10a remaining unaffected (Fig.1D). Although 
Hs578T was not growth-restricted under ME2kd condi -
tions, the migratory capacity was significantly affected. 
Interestingly, BT-20 cells showed increased migration at 
72 h. The impaired migration observed in MDA-MB-468, 
HCC1806, and Hs578T cells suggests that ME2 may play 
a role in metastatic behavior. The differential response in 
migration further supports the notion of variable reliance 
on ME2 in highly heterogeneous TNBC tumors.
The metabolic transcriptome is dysregulated under ME2 
knockdown
To investigate the effects of ME2kd on the metabolic 
transcriptome, we used the NanoString Metabolic Path -
ways Panel, which examined the expression of ~ 750 
metabolic genes. ME2 silencing was achieved per cell 
line with a panel of 3 different siRNA targeting ME2; 
the siRNA with the highest efficacy was chosen for each 
cell line independently. As expected, ME2kd resulted 
in extensive ME2 downregulation across all tested cell 
lines. We observed substantial changes in metabolic 
genes, including PSAT1, which was upregulated in 
MDA-MB-468, HCC1806, and Hs578T cells, but not in 
HCC70 or BT-20 cells (Fig. 1F). Gene set analysis with 
Nanostring pathways revealed a high degree of similar -
ity between MDA-MB-468 and HCC1806 cells, both of 
which were growth-restricted under ME2kd (Fig. 1G).

Overall, ME2kd resulted in variable responses to the 
expression of other metabolic genes.
Tumors derived from ME2kd MDA-MB-468 cells grow 
slower in nude mice
We assessed the growth of HCC70 and MDA-MB-468 
cells under ME2kd within the context of whole-body 
metabolism using in vivo xenograft studies, compar -
ing ME2kd to the scrambled control. These two cell 
lines were selected for their opposing phenotypes in 
vitro under ME2kd; HCC70 was not growth-restricted, 
whereas MDA-MB-468 grew 50% slower. Tumors derived 
from MDA-MB-468 cells under ME2kd exhibited slower 
growth than the scrambled control, while the HCC70-
ME2kd tumors were not restricted (Fig. 2A, E). MDA-
MB-468-ME2kd tumors grew linearly, in contrast to the 
exponential growth of scrambled controls at 35 days 
post-implantation. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed 
an extension in survival time for mice bearing MDA-MB-
468-ME2kd tumors compared to those bearing scram -
bled shRNA (p = 0.008 (log-rank test) (Fig. 2F). There was 
no difference in survival in the HCC70 group ( p = 0.1864) 
(Fig. 2B). Knockdown of ME2 expression was confirmed 
in both HCC70 and MDA-MB-468 derived tumors after 
dissection by qPCR ( p < 0.001, p < 0.01; Fig. 2C, G). H&E 
staining of tumor sections (Fig. 2D, H) showed that 
ME2kd tumors were more compact, suggesting a possible 
defect in their metastatic potential.
Malic Enzyme 2 Knockdown Induces a Negative Correlation 
Between Mitochondrial Respiration and Glycolysis
Due to ME2’s role in the mitochondria, we next evaluated 
mitochondrial respiration and glycolytic function using 
Seahorse analysis via the mitochondrial stress test (MST) 
and glycolysis stress test (GST), respectively.
The effects on both MST and GST of ME2kd varied 
widely across TNBC models. No statistical differences in 
MST were observed between the scrambled and MDA-
MB-468-ME2kd lines (Fig.  3 B). Most changes in MDA-
MB-468-ME2kd cells were observed with GST. Changes 
were observed in glycolysis (+ 24% in ME2kd, p < 0.001) 
and glycolytic capacity (+ 16% in ME2kd, p < 0.001).
HCC70 cells showed enhanced mitochondrial respi -
ration but reduced glycolytic function (Fig. 3C). MST 
results revealed increases in basal respiration (+ 44% 
in ME2kd, p < 0.001) and mitochondrial ATP produc -
tion (+ 48% in ME2kd, p < 0.001) and a decrease in spare 
capacity (−53% in ME2kd, p < 0.001). GST showed a 
minor decrease in glycolysis (−7% in ME2kd, p = 0.04) 
and a moderate decrease in glycolytic capacity (−16% 
in ME2kd, p < 0.001). Notably, HCC70 also showed a 
decrease in glycolytic reserve (−26% in ME2kd, p < 0.001).
In contrast, mitochondrial respiration decreased, 
whereas glycolytic function increased with ME2kd in 
BT-20 cells (Fig. 3D). MST results showed moderate 
decrease in basal respiration (−6% in ME2kd, p = 0.04), 
maximal respiration (−8% in ME2kd, p = 0.01), and ATP

production (−7% in ME2kd, p < 0.001). GST results 
showed moderate increase in glycolysis (+ 10% in ME2kd, 
p < 0.001) and glycolytic reserve (+ 15% in ME2kd, 
p < 0.001).
Hs578T-ME2kd cells exhibited moderate changes in 
mitochondrial activity and significant changes in glyco -
lytic function (Fig. 3E). MST results showed a moder -
ate increase in maximal respiration (+ 12% in ME2kd, 
p < 0.001). GST results showed major decreases in

glycolysis (−22% in ME2kd, p < 0.001) and glycolytic 
capacity (−21% in ME2kd, p < 0.001).
ME2kd caused major changes in HCC1806 in mito -
chondrial function but exhibited no statistically signifi -
cant changes in glycolysis (Fig. 3F). MST results showed 
decreases in basal respiration (−23% in ME2kd, p < 0.001), 
maximal respiration (−34% in ME2kd, p < 0.001), and 
ATP production (−44% in ME2kd, p < 0.001). In con -
trast, the GST results showed no difference between 
the scrambled and ME2kd groups. No differences were 
observed between the normal-like MCF10a scrambled 
and MCF10a-ME2kd cells, either in terms of mitochon -
drial or glycolytic function (Fig. 3A).
Malic enzyme 2 knockdown causes large changes to 
malate and its related metabolites
The observed functional changes in the mitochondria 
led us to investigate metabolite levels. We used GC-MS 
to quantify the concentration of malate, the substrate of 
ME2, and its relevant metabolites, as depicted in Fig. 4.
Malate levels increased in all TNBC lines, from a 1.80-
fold increase in MDA-MB-468 cells ( p < 0.01) to a 6.48-
fold increase in HCC70 cells ( p < 0.001). In contrast, the 
non-cancerous MCF10a cell line exhibited a 1.24-fold 
decrease. Most TNBC cell lines showed negligible change 
in fumarate concentration following ME2 knockdown. 
However, HCC70 exhibited a ~ 8-fold increase in fuma -
rate. Fumarate is known to allosterically activate ME2 
[35]. Thus, its accumulation may have partially compen -
sated for the loss in expression of the enzyme. This could 
help explain the lack of significant change observed in 
growth in vitro and in vivo for this cell line (Fig. 2A-D).
Only BT-20 and HCC1806 showed notable shifts in 
pyruvate, with BT-20 decreasing 1.92-fold ( p < 0.001) 
and HCC1806 increasing 1.77-fold ( p = 0.06). However, 
lactate changed significantly in most TNBC lines, sug -
gesting a potential flux redirection between lactate and 
pyruvate. Lactate levels decreased in HCC70 (1.49-fold, 
p = 0.02) and BT-20 (2.23-fold, p < 0.01), but increased 
sharply in Hs578T cells (7.21-fold, p < 0.001) and mod -
estly in HCC1806 (1.57-fold, p = 0.05).
Glutamate levels declined across TNBC cell lines, espe-
cially in HCC70 (1.81-fold decrease, p < 0.01) and BT-20 
(1.77-fold decrease, p = 0.02). Glutamine utilization as 
an alternative energy source is a common phenomenon 
in cancer; however, 13C5-glutamine labeling revealed no 
significant changes in either oxidative or reductive TCA 
cycle activity (Figure S7).
Conversely, aspartate levels increased notably in 
MDA-MB-468 (1.73-fold, p < 0.01), HCC70 (3.65-fold, 
p < 0.01), and HCC1806 (2.3-fold, p < 0.001). Serine con-
centrations remained mostly unchanged, except for a 
1.51-fold decrease in MCF10a cells ( p < 0.001). Glycine 
generally decreased among the TNBC lines, ranging from 
a 1.39- to 1.97-fold decrease, and reached significance in 
MDA-MB-468 (p = 0.03) and HCC1806 (p < 0.01).
Given the consistency between mean enrichment and 
mass isotopologue distribution (MID) data, we sum -
marized labeling results with mean enrichment data. 
Detailed MIDs are available in Supplementary Figures S5 
and S6.
Serine/Glycine deprivation highlights Cell-Specific TCA 
perturbations with ME2 knockdown
Building on previous findings linking the loss of ME2 
with increased expression of de novo serine synthesis 
enzymes (Fig. 1F), we conducted a glucose-labeled trac -
ing experiment under serine and glycine ‐deprived con -
ditions to examine how ME2kd influences malate and 
serine metabolism (Fig.  5). Restricting serine and glycine 
triggered distinct TCA metabolic responses in each cell 
line. MCF10a and MDA-MB-468 showed minimal shifts 
in TCA labeling after ME2kd, whereas BT-20, Hs578T, 
and HCC1806 exhibited altered labeling of malate and 
fumarate. Malate labeling decreased by up to 11% in 
HCC1806 ( p < 0.001), but increased by 2% in Hs578T 
(p = 0.02). Fumarate labeling decreased by 7% in HCC70 
(p < 0.01), 38% in BT-20 ( p < 0.001), and 4% in HCC1806 
(p = 0.03).
Pyruvate labeling declined in all TNBC lines yet 
remained unchanged in MCF10a, ranging from a 2% 
decrease in MDA-MB-468 ( p = 0.03) to a 44% decrease 
in Hs578T ( p < 0.001). Lactate followed a similar trend, 
with reductions of up to 51% in HCC1806 ( p < 0.001). 
α-Ketoglutarate and glutamate showed minimal changes 
in MCF10a, MDA-MB-468, and HCC70 cells, while 
BT-20 and HCC1806 exhibited decreased labeling, and 
Hs578T showed increased labeling. α-Ketoglutarate 
labeling increased by 8% in Hs578T ( p < 0.001) but 
decreased by 5% in BT-20 ( p < 0.001). Likewise, gluta -
mate labeling increased by 8% in Hs578T ( p < 0.001), 
but declined in other TNBC lines. Aspartate displayed 
an opposite pattern in most cases, rising 4% in HCC70 
(p < 0.01), 9% in Hs578T ( p < 0.001), and 4% in HCC1806 
(p < 0.01), but decreased slightly (0.9%) in BT-20 
(p < 0.01).
Only MDA-MB-468 and Hs578T showed significant 
differences in serine labeling between scrambled and 
ME2kd cells under serine/glycine-deprived conditions, 
with reductions of 6% (p < 0.001) and 8%, respectively.
Under full-media conditions (Fig. S3), all TNBC lines 
displayed significant alterations in serine labeling. 
MDA-MB-468 (6%, p < 0.001), HCC70 (2%, p < 0.001), 
and BT-20 (0.8%, p < 0.01) cells increased, whereas 
Hs578T (4%, p < 0.001) and HCC1806 (5%, p < 0.001) 
cells decreased. Glycine labeling increased in HCC70 
(2%, p = 0.01) and BT-20 (0.7%, p < 0.01), but declined 
in Hs578T (2%, p < 0.001) and HCC1806 (5%, p = 0.06).

Glucose, Serine, and Glycine-Deprivation Shows Increased 
Reliance on Glycolysis and De Novo Serine Synthesis in 
TNBC
Based on the GC-MS results, we performed growth tests 
in medium deprived of serine, glycine, and glucose. We 
compared scrambled and ME2kd lines grown in media 
lacking these components using full-media controls as a 
reference (Fig. 6).
Under serine/glycine deprivation, most TNBC cell 
lines showed reduced growth, with a minimal impact on 
MCF10a cells. MDA-MB-468 had a 19% absolute and 
18% relative decrease in growth in ME2kd ( p = 0.01). 
BT-20 displayed a 27% absolute and 32% relative reduc -
tion ( p = 0.02), and Hs578T displayed a 15% absolute 
and 27% relative decrease ( p = 0.04). Notably, HCC1806 
exhibited a 13% absolute and 34% relative increase in 
growth under serine/glycine deprivation (Fig.6A).
Low-glucose conditions produced significant differ -
ences in MDA-MB-468 and HCC70 cells, but not in other 
TNBC lines. MDA-MB-468 showed an 18% absolute and 
24% relative decrease in ME2kd vs. scrambled ( p < 0.001), 
whereas HCC70 experienced a 16% absolute and 35% rel-
ative decrease (p = 0.02). BT-20 showed a 7% absolute and 
15% relative decrease ( p = 0.08), while Hs578T showed a 
21% absolute and 23% relative decline (p = 0.05). MCF10a 
cells showed no difference (Fig.6B).
When both serine/glycine and glucose levels were 
depleted, all TNBC lines exhibited significant changes. 
MDA-MB-468 had a 21% absolute and 27% relative 
decrease in the ME2kd line ( p < 0.01), while HCC70 
showed a 20% absolute and 42% relative decrease 
(p < 0.01). BT-20 showed a moderate 8% absolute and 19% 
relative decrease (p = 0.02). Hs578T displayed a 17% abso-
lute and 28% relative decline ( p = 0.01). HCC1806 again 
showed increased growth of 15% absolute and 37% rela -
tive (p = 0.01). MCF10a cells remained unaffected under

adaptations to ME2kd are specific to TNBC cell lines.
The Malate-Aspartate Shuttle Works in Concert with Malic 
Enzyme 2 to Regulate Cell Growth in TNBC
The results of the metabolite deprivation test indi -
cated an interplay between ME2, glycolysis, and serine 
metabolism. However, further studies were required to 
elucidate the connections between these metabolic path -
ways. To this end, we investigated the potential role of 
the malate-aspartate shuttle (MAS) in this system. MAS 
was knocked down using siRNA targeting SLC25A13 in 
the 6 cell lines in both the scrambled and the ME2kd cell 
lines. The results of the relative growth of each cell line 
compared to their negative siRNA controls are shown in 
Fig. 6D.
Most TNBC models showed a significant difference 
between scrambled and ME2kd lines with malate-aspar -
tate shuttle knockdown (MASkd). MDA-MB-468 exhib -
ited a 20% absolute and 50% relative decrease in growth 
in the ME2kd cell line as compared to the scrambled 
cell line ( p < 0.01). HCC70 saw a 10% absolute and 40% 
relative decline in growth in the ME2kd line ( p = 0.04). 
BT-20 showed a 15% absolute and 22% relative decline 
in growth comparing the ME2kd line and the scram -
bled line ( p = 0.08). HCC1806 exhibited a 40% absolute 
and 57% relative decrease in growth in the ME2kd line 
(p < 0.01). MCF10a and Hs578T showed no significant 
difference between the scrambled and ME2kd cell lines 
(Fig. 6D).
NPD-389 coordinates the active site metal ion and 
outcompetes malate binding in ME2
We solved the structure of ME2/NAD +/NPD-389 and 
ME2/NAD+ (holoenzyme) at 2.45 Å and 1.89 Å, respec -
tively. Both structures display the canonical malic 
enzyme tetrameric assembly, with NAD + located within 
each active site cavity and buried within the tetramer 
interface. The ME2/NPD-389 tetramer assembly is pro -
duced by crystallographic symmetry from the dimeric 
crystal structure. The inhibitor is localized within each 
active site adjacent to an NAD+ molecule (Fig. 7A-C).

In each of the two unique active sites, NPD-389 coor -
dinates Mg 2+ through its central 2,5-dihydroxyl ben -
zoquinone ring, displaying metal-oxygen distances of 
2.0 Å. NPD-389 binding is competitive with respect to 
L-malate, with both molecules sharing the same site and 
metal coordination (Fig. S9A), which is consistent with 
the literature [ 36, 37] and our own enzyme kinetics and 
inhibition data (Fig.7D). The 4-OMe-substituted phenyl 
groups of the symmetrical molecule project either into a 
non-polar pocket within the protein interior or out into 
the solvent space. Within the non-polar pocket, a small 
section of the protein centered on Thr113 moves to avoid 
a clash (Fig. S9B), and a potential weak hydrogen bond 
is formed between the O-Me group and Asn466. Com -
pared to L-malate binding, the Tyr112 residue, purport -
edly facilitating proton transfer in catalysis, rotates away 
from the active site and forms π–π ring-stacking interac -
tions with the buried 4-OMe-substituted phenyl group 
of NPD-389 (Fig.7B and C; Fig. S9A). Analysis of the 
more solvent-exposed end of the active site is more com -
plex, with the 4-OMe-substituted phenyl less sterically 
restrained and with two alternative NAD+ conformations 
observed at different sites of the holoenzyme structure. 
In chains C and D of the holoenzyme, NAD + displays 
the same localization and conformation as in the NPD-
389 structure, while in chains A and B, the nicotinamide 
group of NAD + is flipped approximately 180°, forming 
polar interactions with Arg165 and Asp279 that would 
clash with the observed inhibitor binding mode. Irre -
spective of the NAD + configuration, inhibitor binding at 
this solvent-exposed end induces a conformational rear -
rangement of the protein
between Glu164 and Gly170 to eliminate a clash with 
the side chain of Leu167, similar to that observed for 
L-malate binding (Fig. S). The solvent-exposed 4-OMe-
substituted phenyl also forms potential π interactions 
with the Leu 167 backbone oxygen and the side chain 
of Arg 165. A detailed illustration of the intermolecular 
interactions is provided in Fig. 7C.
Target engagement of ME2 by NPD-389 in isolated 
mitochondria
A substrate-uncoupler-inhibitor-titration (SUIT) proto -
col was employed to validate the target engagement of 
ME2 by NPD-389 in intact mitochondria isolated from 
F-293 cells. In the absence of NPD-389, the mitochondria 
exhibited near-maximal respiration in the presence of 
malate and ADP (Fig. S6A, B). However, NPD-389 inhib -
ited malate-driven respiration in a dose-dependent man -
ner, which was reversed to vehicle control levels upon 
addition of pyruvate. At concentrations 10-fold and the 
Ki for ME2, NPD-389 decreased malate respiration ver -
sus vehicle control by ~ 50% and 80% without compro -
mising components of the electron transport system.
NPD-389 inhibits growth in some TNBC models
To evaluate the potential of the known ME2 inhibitor 
NPD-389 to inhibit the growth of TNBC, we assessed cell 
viability in TNBC cell lines. NPD-389 (Fig. 7E) evoked 
varying dose-dependent decreases in the viability of 
HCC1806, HCC70, and BT-20 compared to MCF10a; 
MDA-MB-468 was only minimally affected. Notably, the 
IC50 was lower for all TNBC cell lines except for Hs578T 
compared to the MCF10a control – MCF10a, 11.9µM; 
MDA-MB-468, 10.5µM; HCC1806, 2.8µM; HCC70, 
1.8µM; Hs578T, 17µM; and BT-20, 3µM, indicating that 
while NPD-389 is not effective enough to serve as a 
potential drug, structural modifications to the compound 
would likely improve the efficacy.
Discussion
ME2 has emerged as an important mediator of metabolic 
states in cancers, including TNBC, by modulating the 
production of NAD(P)H and, to a lesser extent, pyruvate. 
Given the reliance on glutamine for many aggressive can-
cer subtypes [ 38] and the capacity to convert glutamine 
into malate through the TCA cycle, increased expression 
of malate-processing enzymes such as ME2 is an impor -
tant adaptation in cancer. In this study, we aimed to 
determine the contribution of ME2 to TNBC cell growth, 
migration, and metabolic flux. TCGA analysis revealed 
a negative correlation between ME2 and de novo serine 
synthesis gene expression, as well as several genes relat -
ing to glycine metabolism (GCAT, GAMT, GNMT, and 
SHMT1) (Fig. 1A). As glycine, along with glutamate and 
cysteine, is a component of glutathione (GSH) this may 
suggest that ME2 expression may also be connected to 
redox regulation via this pathway. This was supported 
by our GC-MS data that showed changes in concentra -
tion and labelling for glycine and glutamate in Figs. 4 
and 5. ME2kd significantly reduced the proliferation of 
MDA-MB-468 and HCC1806 cells. ME2 depletion led 
to a striking reduction in migration of MDA-MB-468, 
HCC1806, and Hs578T cells, indicating that ME2 may 
enhance metastatic potential, similar to its reported role 
in melanoma [39]. The differential response in migration, 
with BT-20 showing increased migration at 72 h, further 
supports the notion of variable reliance on ME2 in highly 
heterogeneous TNBC tumors.
The effects on growth and metastatic phenotypic 
features observed in vitro were consistent with the in 
vivo behavior of the ME2kd xenografts. MDA-MB-
468-ME2kd tumors progressed more slowly than the 
scrambled controls, particularly at later stages of tumor 
progression. Importantly, survival analysis showed pro -
longation of survival of mice bearing MDA-MB-468-
ME2kd tumors. However, we observed that ME2 played 
a relatively minor role in some TNBC models. This diver-
sity in phenotypes may be due to differences in metabolic 
Page 17 of 20
Jeon et al. Cancer & Metabolism            (2025) 13:42 
dependencies or genetic backgrounds. For example, 
in terms of the TNBC cell lines utilized in the in vivo 
tests, the MDA-MB-468 cell line exhibits amplification 
of EGFR and expresses high levels of the protein, while 
HCC70 does not [40, 41]. The differential dependence on 
EGFR signaling could be an important factor related to 
the induction of different cell states by ME2 inhibition, 
which requires further investigation.
The observed interplay between mitochondrial res -
piration and glycolysis provides valuable insights into 
metabolic shifts following ME2kd. Notably, there was an 
overall inverse trend between the changes in mitochon -
drial respiration and glycolytic activity (Fig. 3). Cell lines 
with increased OCR, such as HCC70 and Hs578T, dis -
played decreased ECAR, whereas cell lines with reduced 
OCR, such as BT-20 and HCC1806, displayed either 
increased ECAR (BT-20) or no change (HCC1806). In 
contrast, MDA-MB-468 cells showed no clear change in 
OCR but exhibited a significant increase in ECAR upon 
ME2kd. These findings led us to hypothesize that ME2 
may play a crucial role in regulating the energy balance 
between the mitochondria and cytosol, and that com -
pensation is reliant upon alternative pathways utilized by 
the cell. Such a role could explain the reciprocal changes 
observed in OCR and ECAR and the highly variable 
response to ME2kd.
Multiple experiments in this study, including glucose-
labeled GC-MS, Seahorse flux analyses, western blot -
ting, and gene expression, indicated a potential link 
between ME2 and de novo  serine synthesis. Three spe -
cific observations from the GC–MS data support this 
idea: (i) malate concentrations differed substantially 
under ME2kd, yet labeling data did not indicate equally 
large flux changes; (ii) glutamate levels shifted in oppo -
site directions to aspartate; and (iii) lactate synthesis was 
significantly reduced in ME2kd cells.
Initially, we thought that increased mitochondrial bio -
genesis was responsible for increased malate levels. How-
ever, our data from Seahorse suggests otherwise. We 
considered NAD +/NADH balance, which is a common 
thread across all pathways of interest. ME2 generates 
NAD(P)H from NAD(P) +, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) 
recycles NADH to NAD +, and phosphoglycerate dehy -
drogenase (PHGDH) consumes NAD+ to produce NADH 
during serine synthesis. Finally, the malate–aspartate 
shuttle, which involves malate, aspartate, glutamate, and 
α-ketoglutarate, facilitates the transfer of reducing equiv-
alents between the mitochondria and cytosol.
The observed potential connections between ME2kd, 
glycolysis, and de novo  serine synthesis prompted us to 
examine its growth under nutrient-restricted condi -
tions. We hypothesized that TNBC cells deficient in 
ME2 would exhibit heightened sensitivity to nutrient 
depletion compared with controls. Indeed, our results 
revealed distinct vulnerabilities in TNBC cells upon 
nutrient depletion (Fig. 6). MDA-MB-468 and Hs578T 
cells exhibited growth impairment in the absence of 
serine and glycine (Fig.6A), which lined up with label -
ing changes during serine deprivation (Fig. 5). However, 
BT-20 experienced inhibited growth in these conditions, 
with no changes to labeling, suggesting that serine uptake 
is integral for growth in this cell line. Glucose deprivation 
tests (Fig. 6B) were consistent with respect to Seahorse 
GST (Fig. 3) for MDA-MB-468and BT-20, while HCC70 
showed an inverted correlation. The correlation between 
glucose deprivation sensitivity and altered glycolytic flux, 
as indicated by Seahorse data, highlights glycolysis as a 
potential vulnerability under ME2kd in some TNBC cell 
lines.
An important observation from these experiments is 
the differential reliance of TNBC cell lines on serine/gly -
cine versus glucose. Hs578T and HCC1806 demonstrated 
greater dependency on serine and glycine availability, 
experiencing pronounced growth reductions under these 
conditions (Fig.6A), aligning with reduced serine labeling 
in both their controls and ME2kds under serine/glycine 
deprivation (Fig. 5), and a significant decrease in serine 
labeling following ME2kd in complete media (Fig. S3). 
HCC70 has been previously characterized with robust 
serine biosynthesis flux, while MDA-MB-468is known 
for increased serine pathway gene expression. This meta -
bolic preference correlated with higher baseline lactate 
production and minimal labeling shifts in lactate and 
pyruvate upon ME2kd (Fig. 5 and Fig. S3), consistent 
with an inherently robust glycolytic pathway [13].
We hypothesized that the MAS could interconnect 
ME2, glycolysis, and serine biosynthesis. Specifically, 
we postulated that ME2kd leads to the accumulation of 
mitochondrial NAD +, thereby enhancing MAS activity 
and increasing cytosolic NAD + levels for PHGDH-driven 
serine synthesis. Elevated cytosolic NAD + and reduced 
malate-to‐pyruvate conversion would shift the LDH reac-
tion in the reverse direction, preserving pyruvate for the 
TCA cycle. This conceptual model unifies the observed 
shifts in malate, aspartate, glutamate, and lactate by 
highlighting the central role of NAD +/NADH homeo -
stasis and the malate–aspartate shuttle in coordinating 
metabolic pathways under ME2kd. This idea is further 
supported by a recent study by Broeks et al. (2023), who 
highlighted the significance of the malate-aspartate shut -
tle in de novo serine synthesis.
MDA-MB-468 and HCC70 showed profound growth 
inhibition under MAS inhibition, suggesting that MAS 
is highly active and plays a critical role in maintaining 
NAD+/NADH balance in these cells (Fig. 6D), concordant 
with the elevated serine labeling observed in these cells. 
In contrast, HCC1806 was largely unaffected by MAS 
inhibition alone, but showed pronounced sensitivity to 
Page 18 of 20
Jeon et al. Cancer & Metabolism            (2025) 13:42 
the combination with ME2kd, indicating that ME2 plays a 
proportionally greater role in redox maintenance in these 
cells. Notably, neither MAS inhibition nor ME2kd had a 
significant impact on the normal-like cell line MCF10A 
growth, implying a reduced reliance on these pathways 
by non-tumorigenic cells. Collectively, these results sug -
gest an interdependence between ME2 and MAS in regu-
lating metabolic flexibility and highlight their potential as 
therapeutic targets for TNBC.
X-ray crystallography structural data combined with in 
vitro mitochondrial activity assays demonstrated direct 
target engagement between NPD-389 and ME2 (Fig. 7A-
D). The NPD-389/ME2 complex structural data showed 
binding within the active site with coordinate bonds that 
chelate the magnesium metal center with extensions into 
a small non-polar pocket and toward the solvent space 
(Fig. 7B). Interestingly, the active site magnesium cation 
appears only in conjugation with either malate or NPD-
389 binding, but is otherwise absent in complexed ME2/
NAD + structures, even in the presence of high MgCl2 (10 
mM) concentrations. Therefore, it is possible that NPD-
389 coordinates the metal outside of ME2 and integrates 
it within the active site in the same manner that ATP and 
Mg2+ are considered constitutive complexes within the 
cell [ 42]. This binding mode of NPD-389 is consistent 
with its action as a competitive inhibitor with respect to 
the substrate malate [ 37]. Pharmacological inhibition of 
the malic enzymes using NPD-389 evoked cell viability 
decreases in some TNBC cell lines, but notably not in 
MDA-MB-468 (Fig. 7E). These effects were variable and 
cannot be attributed to the inhibition of ME2 directly, 
due to NPD-389’s lack of specificity for ME2 only.
NPD-389 effectively attenuated malate-ME2-driven 
respiration in mitochondria isolated from F-293 cells. 
This inhibition was dose-dependent and was restored 
to vehicle control levels upon the addition of pyru -
vate. Consistent with the reported IC 50 for inhibition of 
recombinant human ME2 activity [ 37], 5 µM NPD-389 
inhibited malate respiration ~ 50% relative to vehicle 
control. Increasing the NPD-389 concentration to 5-fold 
the IC 50 (25 µM) inhibited 80% of malate respiration, 
which was again completely restored with the addition of 
pyruvate. Substrate-uncoupler-inhibitor-titration (SUIT) 
analysis further confirmed that inhibition of cellular res -
piration occurred through specific target engagement 
with ME2, as 25 µM NPD-389 did not interfere with the 
components of the electron transport chain. These find -
ings show that ME2 mediates maximal complex 1 respi -
ration with malate alone, and that its activity is ablated 
by NPD-389, consistent with the reported IC50, without 
affecting the components of the electron transport chain.
NPD-389, with its central quinone ring, is seem -
ingly undesirable as a drug owing to its potential for 
futile redox cycling. However, the binding mode in ME2 
suggested that this was not due to a problem within the 
active site. Given the high degree of conservation, the 
active sites of ME1/ME2/ME3 suggest that drug discov -
ery efforts targeting these locations may not provide iso -
form selectivity. Whether targeting the active or dimer 
interface sites, computational modelling, including vir -
tual screening, scaffold hopping, SAR assays, and chemi -
cal synthesis, will provide a path towards discovering 
novel malic enzyme inhibitors. Given the observed meta -
bolic compensation via MAS and serine biosynthesis, 
future studies should explore combination therapies that 
target both ME2 and these compensatory pathways. Eval-
uating the efficacy of ME2 inhibition alongside MAS or 
PHGDH inhibitors could reveal whether dual-metabolic 
targeting enhances TNBC vulnerability.
Conclusions
Our results highlight the role of malic enzyme 2 (ME2) in 
modulating TNBC progression through multiple meta -
bolic and phenotypic effects. ME2 knockdown impaired 
the proliferation and/or migration of TNBC cell lines in 
a variable manner. ME2 knockdown significantly reduced 
tumor growth and extended survival in MDA-MB-468. 
Mechanistically, our transcriptomic and metabolic flux 
analyses revealed that ME2 knockdown disrupts energy 
homeostasis by altering key pathways, such as MAS and 
glycolysis, as well as de novo serine biosynthesis. Reduced 
ME2 activity appears to affect NAD+/NADH balance, 
which in turn affects the metabolic branch points in pyru-
vate-to-lactate conversion, α-ketoglutarate/glutamate 
interconversion, and serine synthesis. Notably, some cell 
lines rely on MAS to compensate for ME2 knockdown, 
suggesting that combination strategies targeting both 
ME2 and MAS could overcome adaptive metabolic flex -
ibility for those tumors. Dependence on serine and gly -
cine varied among cell lines, implicating that TNBC cells 
can pivot between amino acid uptake and de novo serine 
biosynthesis. These findings suggest that ME2 supports 
TNBC cell survival and metastatic potential by modulat -
ing metabolic and signaling pathways.
We provide evidence for a link between ME2 activity 
and the serine biosynthesis pathway, a pathway integral 
to the synthesis of nucleotides and amino acids that are 
vital for cell proliferation. Serine biosynthesis intersects 
with glycolysis, and its products feed into the folate cycle 
and methionine metabolism, thereby impacting cellu -
lar methylation processes and redox balance [ 43]. Low-
serine diets have been analyzed as a treatment strategy in 
combination with chemotherapy or alone for TNBC [44]. 
Inhibition of ME2 could synergize with therapies aimed 
at other metabolic pathways, including MAS or de novo 
serine biosynthesis.
Pharmacological studies using NPD-389 further sup -
port the importance of the malic enzymes in TNBC

growth. This pan-malic enzyme inhibitor blocked 
malate-driven respiration in a dose-dependent manner 
by engaging the active site of ME2 and coordinating its 
essential magnesium ion. Structural analyses confirmed 
that while NPD-389 can inhibit ME2 effectively, achiev -
ing isoform selectivity among ME1/ME2/ME3 may prove 
challenging. Nonetheless, novel strategies aimed at either 
the active site or dimer interface, along with rational drug 
design and structure-guided optimization, provide excit -
ing avenues for future inhibitor development.
Overall, this work demonstrates that ME2 is involved 
in the metabolism of triple-negative breast cancer 
(TNBC), supporting tumor growth and survival through 
its involvement in energy production. Targeting ME2 
in TNBC patients could disrupt metabolic homeostasis 
and improve therapeutic outcomes, potentially in com -
bination with interventions targeting serine metabolism, 
glycolysis, or MAS. Further in-depth work on drugging 
compensatory mechanisms and metabolic plasticity 
among different TNBC subtypes will be critical for refin -
ing targeted therapies and improving patient outcomes, 
as well as for identifying new small-molecule inhibitors 
targeting ME.
