Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), one of the most widely used plastics in the world, causes serious environmental 
pollution. Recently, researchers have focused their eﬀorts on enzymatic degradation of PET, which is an attractive 
way of degrading and recycling PET. In this work, PET hydrolase Sb PETase from Schlegelella brevitalea sp. nov. was 
biochemically characterized, and rational design was performed based on its sequence similarity with the previ- 
ously reported Is PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis , resulting in a triple mutant with increased activity. Furthermore, 
using a sec-dependent signal peptide PeIB and colicin release protein Kil, we set up a high-eﬃciency secretion 
system of PETase in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3), enabling higher PETase secretion. Utilizing this secretion system, 
we established a high-throughput screening method named SecHTS ( sec retion-based h igh-throughput s creening) 
and performed directed evolution of Is PETase and Sb PETase through DNA shuﬄing. Finally, we generated a 
mutant Is PETase S139T with increased activity from the mutant library. 
1. Introduction 
Plastic is widely used around the world due to its insulating prop- 
erties, corrosion resistance, and low price. Plastic has a wide range of 
applications in industry (wires, electrical enclosures), agriculture (agri- 
cultural tools), medical treatment (medical appliances, artiﬁcial blood 
vessels), and people’s daily lives. In 2016, plastic production reached 
335 million tons per annum, with Europe alone producing 60 million 
tons. Over the next 20 years, the amount of plastic produced is expected 
to double [1] . As a consequence, large amounts of plastic waste have 
accumulated in our environment. As of 2015, approximately 6,300 Mt 
of plastic waste had been generated, of which around 9% was recy- 
cled, 12% was incinerated, and 79% was accumulated in landﬁlls or the 
natural environment [2] . Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), one of the 
most widely used polymeric plastic materials, is composed of tereph- 
thalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG). It is a popular material used 
to produce beverage bottles and fabric because of its transparency, mal- 
leability, and resistance to natural degradation processes [3] . However, 
the extensive application of PET plastic has led to its accumulation in 
landﬁlls and oceans, contaminating the soil and seawater. This has be-

come a huge threat to the environment, and has become the focus of 
international research eﬀorts. 
Many methods are available to recycle PET wastes including phys- 
ical and chemical processes. However, these methods have not been 
widely used due to their high temperature and high-pressure require- 
ments, or due to the considerable amounts of solvents and degrading 
agents that are needed for de-polymerization, which create ecological 
and contamination issues [4] . However, it is possible to biodegrade 
PET at mild temperatures and pH conditions in the absence of haz- 
ardous chemicals [5] . Studies on enzymatic degradation of PET have 
been underway for a long time and are still ongoing. Müller et al. 
[6] puriﬁed the polyester hydrolase TfH from the actinomycete Ther- 
mobiﬁda fusca DSM43793 and demonstrated for the ﬁrst time that a 
commercial PET ﬁlm (10% crystallinity) can be eﬀectively hydrolyzed 
by an enzyme. According to the comparison of TfH with other lipases 
and esterases, Kleeberg et al. [7] named TfH as cutinase. Baker et al. 
[8] and Tokiwa and Calabia [9] have studied the degradation of vari- 
ous polyesters and found that cutinase functions directly in degrading 
synthetic polyesters. Subsequently, some PET hydrolases were isolated 
from actinomycetes [10] and other bacteria (Table S1) [11–14] . In ad-

dition, another LC-cutinase, which was isolated from leaf-branch com- 
post using a metagenomic approach, also showed an ability to degrade 
PET [15] . 
Recently, Yoshida et al. [16] isolated a bacterium from a PET bot- 
tle recycling site, named Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6, which can pro- 
duce and secrete PET hydrolases ( Is PETase). Several crystal structures of 
Is PETase have been determined independently by other research groups 
[19,18,17,20,21] . Some researchers have made great eﬀorts to obtain 
mutants of Is PETase with improved hydrolytic activity through site- 
directed mutagenesis. Based on structural analyses, Joo et al. [20] found 
that the activity of the mutant Is PETase R280A increased by 22.4% in 18 h 
by expanding the substrate binding site when PET ﬁlm was used as a sub- 
strate. Austin et al. [19] produced a double mutant Is PETase S238F/W159H 
based on homology modeling, which was predicted to narrow the 
PETase active site and improve PET degradation activity. Other mutants 
with improved catalytic eﬃciency were also obtained through structure- 
guided mutagenesis by Liu et al. [21] and Ma et al. [22] . Furthermore, 
Son et al. [23] obtained a thermally stable and highly eﬃcient PET 
degradation variant Is PETase S121E/D186H/R280A through a protein engi- 
neering strategy. 
The mutants described above are all obtained from Escherichia coli 
by a conventional and time-consuming puriﬁcation method. To reduce 
the time required for puriﬁcation, researchers have recently developed 
extracellular production methods by utilizing various signal peptides in 
E. coli or Yarrowia lipolytica [26,25,24] . Although there are many ex- 
amples of Is PETase site-directed mutation, there are no reports of DNA 
shuﬄing of PETase so far, which is a nonnegligible strategy that can im- 
prove the desired properties by modifying the target protein. However, 
a high-throughput method is required to screen the mutation library. A 
few methods have been reported to date, with several aimed at simpli- 
fying the methods for detecting the reaction products in vitro [27,28] . 
Heyde et al. [29] presented a method for surface display expression of 
PETase variants in E. coli BL21(DE3), which is suitable for integration 
into high throughput screening systems. But this method requires an 
extra TEV protease cleavage step due to potential steric hindrance of 
the large construct on the cell surface. Furthermore, the ineﬃciency of 
bacterial membrane translocation machinery also limits the amount of 
surface displayed enzyme [30] . 
Here, we conducted sequence alignment based on the amino acid 
sequence of Is PETase and found an uncharacterized protein from 
Schlegelella brevitalea sp. nov., which has been reported as PETase by 
Danso et al. [31] . After biochemical characterization, we found that its 
enzyme activity was lower than Is PETase and we named it Sb PETase. 
We subsequently executed site-directed mutagenesis in Sb PETase and 
employed Is PETase and Sb PETase sequences to perform random muta- 
genesis by DNA shuﬄing to obtain mutants with enhanced hydrolytic 
activity. Moreover, we established a high-eﬃciency secretion system in 
E. coli BL21(DE3) and constructed a Sec retion-based H igh- T hroughput 
S creening method (SecHTS), giving rise to a more convenient screening 
platform for PETase variants, as well as omitting the process of protein 
puriﬁcation.

2.2. Construction of the expression vectors 
The genes encoding Is PETase (accession number WP_054022242) 
and Kil protein (Gene ID 2693958) were chemically synthesized 
(GENEWIZ, Suzhou, China) and respectively cloned into pET22b 
and pRSFduet-1 vectors. The gene encoding Sb PETase was ampli- 
ﬁed from the genome of S. brevitalea sp. nov. by PCR and cloned 
into the pET22b vector. The signal peptide gene sequences of 
Is PETase and Sb PETase were predicted using the SignalP 4.1 Server 
( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/ ) and then removed. 
2.3. Expression and puriﬁcation of the recombinant proteins 
The recombinant protein was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) after 
being induced by 0.1 mM isopropyl 𝛽-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) 
at 18°C. After 18-22 hours, the cells were harvested by centrifugation 
at 4,200 rpm and 4°C for 15 min, and then resuspended in buﬀer A (50 
mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, pH 7.6). Sonication fol- 
lowed and the lysate was centrifuged at 20,000 rpm and 4°C for 25 min, 
2

the supernatant was then collected and applied to a His-Select nickel 
column (Bestchrom, Shanghai, China). After washing the unbound pro- 
teins with buﬀer A, the target protein was eluted with buﬀer B (50 mM 
Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, pH 7.6). PD-10 Desalting 
Columns (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) were used to change buﬀer, and 
the protein was stored in buﬀer C (50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 10% 
glycerol, pH 7.6). The concentration of puriﬁed proteins was determined 
using a NanoDrop One (Thermo Scientiﬁc, USA) at 280 nm wavelength 
and calculated by molar extinction coeﬃcient. 
2.4. Enzymatic activity assays 
Puriﬁed protein (50 nM) was incubated in 500 𝜇l buﬀer (50 mM 
Na 2 HPO 4 -HCl, pH 7.0) that contained 4 mM BHET for 18 hours at 30°C, 
or in 500 𝜇l buﬀer (50 mM Na 2 HPO 4 -HCl, pH 8.0) that contained a 
piece of PET ﬁlm ( 𝜑 5 mm, commercial beverage bottle) for 24 hours 
at 30°C. The reaction was stopped by heat treatment (80°C, 10 min) 
and the liquid was ﬁltered using a 0.22 𝜇m ﬁlter and then analyzed by 
High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). All samples were 
processed in triplicate and the reaction mixtures with boiled proteins 
were used as the negative control. 
2.5. HPLC analysis 
HPLC was performed on an LC-16 system (Shimadzu with SPD 16 
detector) equipped with an Agilent Eclipse XDB-C18 analytical column 
(4.6 × 250 mm). The mobile phase was 20 mM phosphate buﬀer (pH 
2.5, A)/methanol (B). The gradient elution program was as follows: 0 
to 25 min, 30-65% (v/v) methanol; 25-35 min, 65-100% methanol; and 
the ﬂow rate was 1.0 mL/min. Each sample was injected at a volume of 
20 𝜇l, and the column temperature was kept at 30°C. The eﬄuent was 
detected at a wavelength of 240 nm. 
2.6. Eﬀects of pH and temperature on enzyme activity 
The Sb PETase activity was assayed at diﬀerent pH values (6.0-10.0) 
and temperatures (25°C-42°C). Puriﬁed protein was incubated in 500 
𝜇l buﬀer (for pH 6.0-8.0, 50 mM Na 2 HPO 4 -HCl; for pH 9.0-10.0, 50 
mM glycine-NaOH) that contained 4 mM BHET for 18 h. The reaction 
was stopped by heat treatment (80°C, 10 min) and the liquid was ﬁltered 
using a 0.22 𝜇m ﬁlter and then analyzed by HPLC. For Is PETase, because 
its optimum pH on BHET and commercial PET ﬁlm is diﬀerent [21] , we 
also assayed the optimum pH of Sb PETase on commercial PET ﬁlm. 
2.7. Site-directed mutagenesis of SbPETase 
Site-directed mutagenesis was designed and performed to obtain 
mutants with increased activity. All mutants were created by the 
Quikchange method [32] , and the primers used to construct these mu- 
tants are listed in Table 2 . 
2.8. Secretion in E. coli BL21(DE3) 
The vectors of recombinant protein were individually co- 
electroporated with pRSFduet-kil into E. coli BL21(DE3). After induced 
by 0.1 mM IPTG at 28°C for 20 hours, samples were centrifuged at 
4,200 rpm and 4°C for 15 min and the supernatant was collected. Then 
nickel aﬃnity chromatography was used to purify the secreted protein. 
For the enzyme activity assay in fermentation broth, sterilized substrate 
(BHET or PET ﬁlm) was added to the culture medium at the time of 
induction. After culturing at 28°C for 20 hours, the supernatant was 
collected and analyzed by HPLC. 
2.9. Plate clearing assay 
In order to establish a high-throughput screening method, we per- 
formed BHET plate clearing assays. The BHET plates are LB agar plates 
containing 50 𝜇g/ml kanamycin, 50 𝜇g/ml ampicillin, 0.1 mM IPTG, 
and 4 mM BHET powder. The E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring plasmids 
pRSFduet-kil and corresponding PETase expression vectors were inocu- 
lated on BHET plates and incubated at 30°C for up to 48 hours, produc- 
ing and secreting PETase. Zones of clearing around the colonies were 
used as a criterion for the BHET/PET-degrading activity. 
2.10. DNA shuﬄing 
DNA shuﬄing was used to generate libraries by random fragmenta- 
tion of one PETase gene or a pool of PETase homologous genes, followed 
by reassembly of the fragments in a self-priming PCR reaction. JBS DNA 
shuﬄing kit (# PP-103, Germany) was used for DNA shuﬄing experi- 
ments. 
Taking Is PETase and Sb PETase as the starting pool of genes, DNA 
shuﬄing consisted of the following steps. (i) Preparation of genes to 
be shuﬄed: genes for Is PETase and Sb PETase were obtained by PCR 
from pET22b- Is PETase and pET22b- Sb PETase, respectively, and puri- 
ﬁed by agarose gel puriﬁcation. (ii) Fragmentation with DNase I: the 
PCR products were digested into fragments (approximately 50 bp) by 
DNase Ⅰ at 37°C for 4 min and puriﬁed by agarose gel puriﬁcation. (iii) 
Self-priming reassembly: take the puriﬁed DNA fragments of Is PETase 
and Sb PETase in 50 𝜇l PCR mixture to a ﬁnal concentration of 10-20 
ng/ 𝜇l and reassembled by thermocycling in the presence of Taq DNA 
polymerase. (iv) Reassembled products were ampliﬁed by conventional 
PCR: the second PCR was performed with speciﬁc primers, which carry 
the homologous arm of the cloning site of the pET22b vector ( Table 1 ). 
After agarose gel puriﬁcation of the target band, the ampliﬁed library 
was assembled into the pET22b vector and electroporated into E. coli 
BL21(DE3), which already contained pRSFduet-Kil, then plated on LB 
agar plates with 50 𝜇g/ml kanamycin and 50 𝜇g/ml ampicillin. After 
overnight culture at 37°C, the transformants were regarded as a mutant 
library. 
2.11. High-throughput screening method 
The high-throughput screening method contains three steps: prelim- 
inary screening, secondary screening, and enzyme activity quantiﬁca- 
tion. Preliminary screening, also named qualitative screening, involves 
picking clones from the mutant library, then inoculating them on BHET 
plates. Clones that can produce cleared zones are considered capable 
of degrading BHET. Clones from preliminary screening are then ap- 
plied to secondary screening. These clones were inoculated in 1 ml LB 
(unless otherwise speciﬁed, LB used in this method contains 50 𝜇g/ml 
kanamycin, 50 𝜇g/ml ampicillin) and incubated at 37°C overnight, then 
40 𝜇l of the overnight culture was inoculated into 1 ml LB, and incubated 
at 37°C for 2.5 h. At this stage, OD 600 should be between 0.8 and 1.0. 
After OD 600 was normalised to 0.8, the culture was inoculated on BHET 
plates for 1 𝜇l each, and all clones were tested in triplicate. Clones with 
a clearing zone diameter bigger than wild type were selected, and the 
mutants from the supernatant of the culture medium were puriﬁed and 
the enzyme activity was quantiﬁed (for protein puriﬁcation, enzymatic 
assays, and HPLC analysis methods see Sections 2.3 –2.5 ). 
3. Results 
3.1. Establishment of the eﬃcient secretion system for PET degradation 
enzymes in E. coli BL21(DE3) 
To construct a high eﬃciency secretion system in E. coli , we de- 
veloped a method that combines signal peptide PelB (pectate lyase B

signal peptide) and colicin release protein Kil. The recombinant protein 
containing the signal peptide PelB will be targeted to E. coli periplasm 
via the sec-dependent transport pathway, where the signal peptide is re- 
moved by a signal peptidase [33] . The colicin release protein Kil releases 
periplasmic protein by inducing membrane solubilization [34] ; as a re- 
sult, the recombinant proteins can be eﬃciently secreted into the culture 
medium when co-expressed with Kil protein. Using Is PETase as a model, 
we cloned the gene fragment encoding Is PETase into the expression 
vector pET22b, which contains sec-dependent signal peptide PelB up- 
stream of the multiple cloning site, and named it pET22b- Is PETase. The 
gene fragment encoding Kil was then cloned into the vector pRSFduet- 
1 and named pRSFduet-Kil. E. coli BL21(DE3) was co-transformed with 
pET22b- Is PETase and pRSFduet-Kil, and we named the co-expression 
strain BL SPIs . 
After fermentation of BL SPIs , we puriﬁed the secreted protein by 
Ni aﬃnity chromatography and observed a band of ∼30 kDa by 
SDS-PAGE. Compared with intracellularly puriﬁed protein, the pro- 
tein puriﬁed directly from the culture medium contains almost no 
impurity, so no further puriﬁcation was required ( Fig. 1 a). We puri- 
ﬁed approximately 12 mg secreted protein from one liter of fermen- 
tation supernatant, resulting in a yield approximately 5-fold higher 
than the strain that was not co-expressed with Kil protein (data not 
shown). 
To measure the activity of the secreted Is PETase, an in vitro assay 
was performed utilizing BHET as a model substrate. The results showed 
that secreted Is PETase exhibited obvious BHET degradation activity 
( Fig. 1 b-d). As shown in Fig. 1 e-h, we also detected the degradation 
productsMHET and/or TPA) in BL SPIs fermentation broth, which were 
hydrolyzed from BHET powder or commercial PET ﬁlms, demonstrating 
that secreted Is PETase had activity in culture medium. 
3.2. Biochemical characterization of SbPETase 
Currently known PET degradation enzymes were mainly found in 
Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and several fungi, and were divided 
into two types (Type I and Type II) [35] . To discover and characterize

more PET hydrolases, protein sequences alignment was performed us- 
ing Is PETase sequence. This alignment identiﬁed an 𝛼/ 𝛽 hydrolase from 
S. brevitalea sp. nov., which has been reported but not characterized 
[31] , that we named Sb PETase. The amino acid sequence of Sb PETase 
shares 91% coverage and 67% identity with Is PETase and the catalytic 
amino acids are conserved, including Ser-Asp-His catalytic triad (with 
the conserved serine hydrolase Gly–x1–Ser–x2–Gly motif) and the two 
cysteines that form the disulﬁde bond. The Sb PETase sequence is also 
highly conserved among most of the substrate binding sites identiﬁed 
by Joo et al. [20] . However, the counterparts of Ile208 in subsite Ⅰ and 
Thr88 in subsite Ⅱ of Is PETase are mutated to Val and Leu, respectively, 
in the sequence of Sb PETase (Val181 and Leu61) (Fig. S1). Phylogenetic 
analysis indicated that Sb PETase and Is PETase share a close genetic re- 
lationship (Fig. S4). 
To perform the biochemical characterization of Sb PETase, we con- 
structed the secretory expression vector pET22b- Sb PETase, and co- 
transformed it with pRSFduet-Kil plasmid into E. coli BL21(DE3) to con- 
struct the secretory strain BL SPSb . After fermentation of BL SPSb , Sb PETase 
was puriﬁed from the fermentation supernatant ( Fig. 2 a). Using the in 
vitro activity assay, we demonstrated that Sb PETase could degrade PET 
and BHET into MHET and a small quantity of TPA just like Is PETase 
( Fig. 2 b-e), but the activity was only half (BHET as substrate) or one 
eighth (PET ﬁlm as substrate) that of Is PETase (Fig. S2). The optimum 
conditions showed that at 30°C, pH 7.0 (BHET as substrate) or pH 8.0 
(PET ﬁlm as substrate), Sb PETase showed the highest activity (Fig. S3). 
3.3. Rational design of SbPETase by site-direct mutagenesis 
Due to the diﬀerences in substrate binding sites between Sb PETase 
and Is PETase (Fig. S1), and since reported Is PETase mutants showed 
improved catalytic eﬃciency [19,20] , we performed the following site- 
directed mutagenesis: Y60A, L61T, W132H, W132A, V181I, T212F, 
T212S, and R259A. All Sb PETase mutants were obtained from culture 
medium directly and an in vitro activity assay was performed, which

generated two mutants ( Sb PETase W132H , Sb PETase R259A ) with improved 
catalytic eﬃciency ( Fig. 3 ). The activity of another mutant Sb PETase L61T 
was only improved towards BHET ( Fig. 3 ). We then combined these 
three mutants ( Sb PETase W132H , Sb PETase R259A , Sb PETase L61T ), to gen- 
erate three double mutants and one triple mutant. An in vitro activity 
assay showed that the triple mutant had the highest catalytic eﬃciency 
towards PET ﬁlm ( Fig. 3 ). However, its activity was still much lower 
than that of Is PETase. 
3.4. Directed evolution of SbPETase and IsPETase and the establishment of 
a high-throughput screening method 
Since a high-eﬃciency secretion system has been established, in 
order to obtain PETase mutants with increased catalytic activity, we 
decided to perform directed evolution of Is PETase by DNA shuﬄing. 
However, due to the disadvantages of the traditional screening method, 
which is laborious and time-consuming, we needed to establish a new 
approach for screening the mutants rapidly and easily. On account of 
the water-insoluble property of BHET, we utilized BHET as a model 
substrate for PET degradation. The secretory strain BL SPIs and BL SPSb 
were employed to perform BHET plate clearing assay. To analyze the 
feasibility of this method, we inoculated the same amount of BL SPIs and 
BL SPSb growing in log phase on the BHET plate. After 36 h of incuba- 
tion at 30°C, both colonies generated clear circles and the circle around 
BL SPIs was larger than that around BL SPSb ; the cleared zone diameter 
roughly reﬂects the level of enzyme activity. So, we set up a screening 
method taking advantage of the BHET plate clearing assay and named 
it Secretion-based High-Throughput Screening method (SecHTS). The 
screening process is shown in Fig. 4 b. 
Since there is high homology between Is PETase and Sb PETase, we 
ﬁrstly performed DNA shuﬄing [36] of these two genes ( Fig. 4 a). 
Then we cloned the DNA shuﬄing products into pET22b. After trans- 
forming these vectors into E. coli BL21(DE3) harboring pRSFduet-Kil, 
we obtained a mutant library containing approximately 10,000 clones 
( Fig. 4 b). Next, we screened this random mutant library using the 
SecHTS method. 
Firstly, we picked 1,000 random clones from the library, and after 
preliminary screening, 734 clones that did not generate cleared zones 
were excluded. Then we performed secondary screening in the remain- 
ing 266 clones to pick out 14 clones with bigger cleared zones and 
four clones containing the same amino acid sequences were removed 
( Fig. 4 c). Ten variants were further puriﬁed from the fermentation su- 
pernatant, and their activities were quantiﬁed in vitro . We obtained a 
mutant, 765, with higher PET ﬁlm degradation activity than Is PETase, in 
which the amount of degradation product TPA was 8% higher than that 
of Is PETase ( Fig. 5 ). Sequence analyses of the mutant showed that the 
Ser139 residue mutated to threonine, and it was named Is PETase S139T . 
Ser139 is located near substrate binding subsite Ⅱ [20] , so we suspected 
that the mutated residue of Ser139 to Thr may aﬀect the binding of the 
substrate, which beneﬁts the catalytic activity of this mutant. 
To enlarge the starting pool genes, we selected another four PETases 
(TfH, TfCut2, Est119, and Cut190) with higher similarity to Is PETase 
from currently known PET degradation enzymes to perform DNA shuf- 
ﬂing with Is PETase and Sb PETase. But unfortunately, we were unable to 
obtain target fragments after self-priming reassembly and second PCR 
steps. 
4. Discussion 
Although multiple Is PETase mutants with improved hydrolytic 
activity have been obtained through site-directed mutagenesis 
[19,38,23,37] , there have been no attempts at random mutations 
and directed evolution of PETases. The main goal of our work was thus 
to establish a high-throughput screening method and apply it to the 
directed evolution of PET degrading enzymes. 
In this study, we established a secretion system in E. coli BL21(DE3), 
and showed that co-expression of the Kil protein greatly improved the 
secretion eﬃciency. Then we biochemically characterized Sb PETase 
from Schlegelella brevitalea sp. nov. According to the diﬀerences in sub- 
strate binding sites between Sb PETase and Is PETase mutants, we con- 
structed several Sb PETase mutants, some of which showed improved 
catalytic activity. A few mutants ( e.g., Sb PETase L61T ) could degrade 
BHET with high eﬃciency, however, there was no improvement in the 
degradation activity of PET. Therefore, large polymer segments may be 
unable to ﬁt into a binding cleft that is not suitable [37] . 
Because the activity of Sb PETase mutants is still much lower than 
that of Is PETase, we performed directed evolution of Sb PETase and 
Is PETase through DNA shuﬄing. Additionally, we set up a high- 
throughput screening platform based on the secretion system in E. coli 
BL21(DE3) and named it SecHTS. In this way, the screening process 
becomes visualization, such that mutants can be ﬁrst screened depend- 
ing on the sizes of cleared zones on the plate clearing assay. This dra- 
matically reduced the sample amount with almost no consumption of 
time and eﬀort, allowing target mutants to be selected quickly from 
the library with a limited number of samples required for quantita- 
tive analysis. Using this method, we successfully obtained the mutant 
Is PETase S139T with enhanced activity. Austin et al. [19] found that nar- 
rowing the binding cleft around the active site via mutation improved 
the degradation activity of PETase. Ser139 is not included in the char- 
acterized substrate binding site, but is located near binding subsite Ⅱ

Screening method). c) Several representative results of the BHET plate clearing assay. 
[18,20] . The mutated residue at Ser139 to Thr may narrow the binding 
cleft due to larger steric hindrance of Thr, resulting in increased activ- 
ity of this mutant. Furthermore, we utilized the optimum temperature 
and pH conditions of Is PETase to screen mutants, but the optimum con- 
ditions for some mutants may have changed, hampering our screening 
eﬀorts. 
Because of the individual diﬀerences between secretion strains har- 
boring diﬀerent PETase mutants, the quantity of enzymes secreted in 
the plate clearing assay could not be accurately controlled. Thus, the 
size of the cleared zone cannot be used for accurate quantiﬁcation and 
time-consuming HPLC is still needed for ﬁnal quantiﬁcation. To solve 
this problem, ﬂuorometric detection dependent high-throughput anal- 
ysis methods could be applied to replace HPLC in the future [27,28] . 
Furthermore, DNA shuﬄing requires that genes in the starting pool con- 
tain regions of relatively high sequence homology, limiting the number 
of genes in the starting pools. In the future, some in vitro homology- 
independent techniques may potentially be used such as incremental 
truncation for the creation of hybrid enzymes (ITCHY) [39] . 
5. Conclusions 
We biochemically characterized a PET-hydrolyzing Sb PETase from 
Schlegelella brevitalea sp. nov. using a high-eﬃciency secretion system. 
In addition, we established a SecHTS ( sec retion-based h igh-throughput 
s creening) platform enabling rapid PETase library screening and feasi- 
bility veriﬁcation. Overall, our study provides a foundation for acceler- 
ating the discovery of novel PETases as well as PETase variant screening 
for industrial applications.
