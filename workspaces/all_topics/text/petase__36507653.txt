ABSTRACT Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a prevalent synthetic polymer that is known
to contaminate marine and terrestrial environments. Currently, only a limited number of PET-
active microorganisms and enzymes (PETases) are known. This is in part linked to the lack
of highly sensitive function-based screening assays for PET-active enzymes. Here, we report
on the construction of aﬂuorescent biosensor based onComamonas thiooxidansstrain S23.

IclR-type transcriptional regulator is found upstream of thetphC-tphA1cluster where TPA
induces transcription oftphC-tphA1up to 88-fold in exponentially growing cells. In the present
study, we show that theC. thiooxidansS23 wild-type strain, carrying the sfGFP gene fused to

mutant lacking the catabolic genes involved in TPA degradationthphA2-A1 (DtphA2A3BA1)
is up to 10,000-fold more sensitive and detects TPA concentrations in the nanomolar range.
This is, to our knowledge, the most sensitive reporter strain for TPA and we demonstrate
that it can be used for the detection of enzymatic PET breakdown products.
IMPORTANCE Plastics and microplastics accumulate in all ecological niches. The construction
of more sensitive biosensors allows to monitor and screen potential PET degradation
in natural environments and industrial samples. These strains will also be a valuable tool
for functional screenings of novel PETase candidates and variants or monitoring of PET
recycling processes using biocatalysts. Thereby they help us to enrich the known biodiversity
and efﬁciency of PET degrading organisms and enzymes and understand their contribution
to environmental plastic degradation.

T
he global use of synthetic and fossil fuel-derived polymers for more than 80 years
together with a lack of multinational concepts for re- and upcycling and circular use
have led to an unprecedented and mostly irreversible accumulation of plastic of various sizes
and blends in almost all ecological niches (1–5).
A promising approach to reduction of plastic wastes in- and outside the recycling chain
are enzymes that are capable of breaking down the polymeric structure of plastics, facilitating
their further degradation or even yielding raw-materials for bioplastics and other value-added
products (6–9). However, today, we have only relatively few enzymes available acting on
some of the human-made commodity polymers. A total of 145 enzymes are currently listed
in the PAZy database acting on synthetic polymers, including 43 different esterases, cuti-
nases, and lipases hydrolyzing the low crystalline and amorphous polymer polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) (10). The majority of the PET active enzymes have been identiﬁed using

sequence-based homology-and hidden Markov-model (HMM) searches. This resulted in a
rather limited biodiversity with active PETases derived from only four bacterial and two fun-
gal phyla. In order to uncover completely novel active PETases derived from a broader diver-
sity, there is the need to establish highly sensitive and function-based assays for rapid
screening of enzyme candidates and metagenome libraries.
Currently, there are already few functional methods known to assess microbial PET
degradation. These methods mainly rely on either weight loss, pH change through hydroly-
sis and/or on the absorption of UV-light through the aromatic constituents of the polymer.
Assaying the enzymatic release of the monomeric building blocks bis(2-hydroxyethyl)tereph-
thalate (BHET), mono(2-hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (MHET), terephthalic acid (TPA) and eth-
ylene glycol (EG) is far more accurate (Fig. 1A). Here, the assessment of enzyme activity using
reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) is the most speciﬁca n d
prevalently used method (11–15). Furthermore, isothermal titration calorimetry-based tech-
nology was published as a sophisticated method allowing direct assessments of the enthalpy
of the ester hydrolysis (16). Furthermore, Fenton chemistry-mediatedﬂuorometric detection
assay for TPA in has also been reported previously, allowing high-throughput screening of
large numbers of samples (17–19).
However, these common technologies are often bound to rather high sample purities
and/or high operation costs and durations. Another promising approach is therefore the
use of biosensors, i.e., modiﬁed organisms, which generate a measurable readout upon
encountering a speciﬁc analyte molecule.

A Highly Sensitive TPA Reporter Strain Applied and Environmental Microbiology

Biosensors have proven to be highly reliable and ultrasensitive tools for the detection
of a large number of molecules and are versatile tools for applications such as ultrahigh-
throughput screenings (20). To date, only three functional biosensor systems for TPA have
been described. Recently, Pardo and colleagues reported on the construction of a reporter
strain inAcinetobacter baylyibased on superfolder greenﬂuorescent protein (sfGFP) and the
transcription factor TphR (21). In their study, Pardo et al. set out to achieve TPA conversion
in A. baylyiby heterologous expression of catabolic and transporter genes fromComamonas
sp. and identiﬁed a novel transporter capable of TPA uptake inA. baylyi. The established re-
porter strain was employed to evaluate the TPA uptake intoA. baylyiand is able to sense
concentrations as low as 10
mM.
More recently, Li and colleagues reported on the construction of a reporter strain based
on the promiscuous XylS regulator protein fromPseudomonas putida(22), which is responsible
for the transcription activation of the meta-toluate degradation pathway (23). In their study, Li

in E. coli. When fused with sfGFP, the detection limit of the XylS-based reporter was as little as
10
mMT P A .
Furthermore, the luciferase LuxAB fromPhotorhabdus luminescenswas employed to
establish a TPA sensitive reporter system (24). The authors of this study combined a carboxylic
acid reductase (CAR) and the luciferase LuxAB to generate a luminescent readout in
E. coli, which semiquantitatively correlated with TPA concentration and was suitable for
high-throughput screening. The reported strain was able to sense TPA concentrations as low
as 1 mM.
Within this framework, we report the construction of a TPA biosensor with a higher
sensitivity based on the Gram-negative bacteriumC. thiooxidansstrain S23 (DSM17888).C.
thiooxidansis capable to take up TPA by employing the tripartite tricarboxylate transporter
(TTT) family genestpiBA together with the periplasmic substrate binding protein TphC and
subsequent catabolism through the genes encoded in thetph operon (25, 26). We made
use of a construct containing the TPA sensitivetphC promoter fused to sfGFP in order to
obtainﬂuorescent readouts inC. thiooxidans. Furthermore, we prove that a deletion mutant
of C. thiooxidanslacking the catabolictph genes is a versatile reporter platform to monitor
TPA concentrations as low as 1 nM. This makes it-to our knowledge-the most sensitive TPA
biosensor which is reported so far.
RESULTS
Previous work demonstrated that the Gram-negative soil bacteriumC. thiooxidansis ca-
pable of degrading TPA using a dioxygenase and dehydrogenase for the initial conversion
of TPA to protocatechuate (PCA), which is then converted further via PCA 4,5 cleavage path-
way (25–29). To achieve this, theC. thiooxidansgenome is equipped with up to two operons
coding for the oxygenase proteins TphA2, A3, B, and A1 and a speciﬁcs u b s t r a t eb i n d i n g
protein, designated TphC.C. thiooxidansstrain S23, however, encodes only for a single operon
within its 5.3 Mb genome (30) (Fig. 1B). The TPA responsive regulator TphR is encoded
upstream in the opposite direction oftphC and a promoter operator sequence of 109 bp
separates both genes. Earlier work had shown that the genestphC-A1 are coexpressed in
response to TPA and that the expression is presumably controlled by the constitutively
expressed regulator protein TphR (25).
Transcriptomic analysis conﬁrms high TPA-dependent upregulation of genes in tph
operon.As a ﬁrst step toward the construction of a TPA-sensitive reporter strain, we
set out to assess other possible genes that could be upregulated inC. thiooxidansS23 in the
presence of TPA. Therefore, we compared expression levels of genes in the presence of either
TPA or succinate as a sole carbon source. Succinate was chosen due to its presence in the
c o r em e t a b o l i cp a t h w a yo ft h ec i t r i ca c i dc y c l ea n dd u et op r e v i o u su s ea st h es u b s t r a t ei n
minimal growth media (26). We sequenced the RNA transcripts ofC. thiooxidansS23 grown
on Wx minimal salt medium supplemented either with TPA (10 mM) or succinic acid
(10 mM). Differential expression analysis of the two growth conditions showed that among
the most strongly and signiﬁcantly upregulated genes were those downstream of thetphC
promoter, withtphCbeing the most upregulated with a log
2-fold ratio of 6.46, corresponding

to an 88.03-fold increased expression. BesidestphC, few other genes were strongly upreg-
ulated among which were also the remaining genes of thetphC-A1 operon withtphA1
being the least upregulated, having a log2-fold ratio of 3.66 corresponding to a 12.66 -fold
higher expression compared to growth on succinate (Table S1, Fig. 1D).
Cloning and assessment of the TPA reporter construct pBBR1MCS-PtphC::sfGFP
(pReporTPA) inC. thiooxidans S23. Based on theseﬁndings and the earlier reports on
the regulation oftphC (25, 26), we set out to establish a TPA reporter strain based on the
TPA inducible promoter oftphC. Therefore, the 109 bp intergenic region betweentphR
and tphC was ampliﬁed from genomic DNA isolated fromC. thiooxidans S23 (Table 1)
using PCR with primers RF_pCT_pGA1K::sfGFP_FW and RF_pCT_pGA1K::sfGFP_RV
(Table 2). The obtained PCR product was cloned into the plasmid pG1AK_sfGFP upstream
of thesfGFP gene. The resulting PtphC::sfGFP construct was transferred into the broad host-
range plasmid pBBR1MCS-1 using the primers RF_pCT::sfGFP_pBBR1MCS_FW and RF_pCT::
sfGFP_pBBR1MCS_RV. The construct pBBR1MCS-PtphC::sfGFP was veriﬁed by DNA sequence
analysis for correctness and transformed intoC. thiooxidansvia electroporation. The construct
was designated pReportTPA (Fig. 1C) andC. thiooxidans S23 carrying it was designated
ReporTPA_UHH03 (Table 1). Positive transformants were identiﬁed by their resistance to
chloramphenicol (Cm) and by colony-PCR using primers M13-20 fw and M13-20 rv (Table 2).
In order to test the responsiveness and sensitivity of ReporTPA_UHH03 toward TPA, the
cells were grown in LB medium and subsequently resuspended in Wx minimal medium con-
taining different TPA concentrations ranging from 0 to 500mM. Theﬂuorescence response
of the cells over time was recorded (Fig. 2A).
As expected, increased TPA concentrations were positively correlated withﬂuorescence
signals. Usually, an increase of theﬂuorescence signal could be observed after 1 to 2 h of
aerobic incubation in 96-well black-walled microtiter plates. After 4 h of incubation, the
gain inﬂuorescence usuallyﬂattened. Here, we observed signiﬁcant differences inﬂuo-
rescence signals when we used concentrations of 10mMT P Ao rh i g h e r .A1 0mMT P Ac o n c e n -
tration resulted in a 10-fold increased induction based on the obtainedﬂuorescence signal
compared to the absence of TPA. A 50mM concentration resulted in a 25-fold overall induc-
tion in ReporTPA_UHH03 (Fig. 2B). Higher concentrations did not result in a further increased
fold-induction.

the capability to grow on TPA due to deletion of thetphA2A3BA1catabolic gene cluster. Cell cultures were
grown in triplicate overnight at 37°C under aerobic conditions.

C. thiooxidans_UHH01. As expected,C. thiooxidans_UHH01 lacking thetphA2-A1genes failed
to grow on TPA (Fig. 2D). Sequencing ofC. thiooxidans_UHH01 genomic DNA conﬁrmed the
deletion of the targeted genes (Fig. S1).
C. thiooxidans_UHH01 was transformed with pReportTPA via electroporation and the
obtained reporter strain was designated ReporTPA_UHH04 (Table 1). Comparison of theﬂuo-
rescence responses of wild-type and mutant biosensors in TPA concentrations ranging from
1n mt o5 0 0mM revealed a up to 10,000-fold increase in sensitivity of UHH04 compared to a
parental strain carrying the same reporter construct. Even at 1 nM TPA concentration, the
ReporTPA_UHH04 mutant biosensor showed a more than 2-fold increase inﬂuorescence
compared to cells incubated without TPA. The maximum signal intensity was achieved
at a 50 nM TPA concentration. Higher TPA concentrations did not result in an increased
ﬂuorescence (Fig. 2C).
We then asked how speciﬁc the regulator TphR would recognize TPA versus other
possible PET degradation products and structurally similar molecules. Therefore, incuba-
tions with nine different substances in part structurally related to TPA were con-
ducted and theﬂuorescence response of the biosensor strains were evaluated (Fig. 3).
Interestingly, the responsiveness toward compounds which are not directly linked to PET
and its degradation products rapidly declined. Notably, hydroxylated forms of TPA such
as 2-hydroxytrephthalate (2 HOTP) and 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalate (2,5 HOTP) which are
not directly associated with PET yielded smaller but clear responses of the reporter
system.
Further tests with ReporTPA_UHH04 implied a slight but nonspeciﬁc increase in back-
ground ﬂuorescence over time for cells that were grown in Wx medium in the absence
of TPA. We speculated that this could be due to metabolic stress which we tried to evade
by adding an alternative carbon source. Therefore, we tested the inﬂuence of 6 different
carbon sources (glucose, gluconate glycerol, acetate, fumarate and succinate) on the TPA
screening sensitivity and background in UHH04. The different carbon sources were sup-
plemented at aﬁnal concentration of 5 mM to Wx medium containing 0 to 500
mMT P A .
Notably, the addition of 5 mM gluconate almost completely quenched the increase in unspe-
ciﬁcb a c k g r o u n dﬂuorescence while maintaining a high sensitivity (Fig. 4) giving fold-induction
values of up to 19 (cTPA =1 0 0mM, t =6h ) .

cluster. Other compounds tested were: 2-hydroxytrephthalate (2 HOTP), mono-(2-hydroxyethyl)terephthalic
acid (MHET), 2,5-dihydroxytrephthalate (2,5 HOTP), bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (BHET), benzoic acid
(BA), styrol, p-Toluic acid (p-TA) and m-Toluic acid (m-TA). All measurements were carried out in triplicate
after an incubation time of 4h. Standard deviations are given as error bars. Fold-induction values were
normalized to reporter strain (wild type orDtphA2A3BA1, respectively) incubated in Wx medium without added
analyte.C. thiooxidansWild type carrying a pBBR1MCS-1 Backbone was employed as strain control.

Altogether, these data imply that the here generatedC. thiooxidansS23 reporter strains
carrying pReporTPA are speciﬁc and highly sensitive tools for the detection of PET degradation
products.
Detection of TPA by using ReporTPA_UHH04 in enzyme assays.To verify the practical
usefulness of ReporTPA_UHH04, further tests were conducted in order to show the feasibil-
ity to detect PETase activity on PET substrates. Therefore, recombinantly produced and
puriﬁed PETases were incubated together with PET foil as the substrate. We employed the
known enzymesIsPETase (11) and LCC (12) together with a novel PETase (PET40), which
was recently discovered by our laboratory. The reaction mixtures were incubated in a vol-
ume of 200
mL for 20 h at 40°C and after this time period, reaction supernatants were
assayed using ReporTPA_UHH04 reporter cells (OD600 of 0.6 in Wx medium) and high pres-
sure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Theﬂuorescent readouts implied that TPA from PET
degradation was already detectable after 1.5 to 2.5 h of incubation using ReporTPA_UHH04
(Fig. 5A). Fluorescence was furthermore detectable and distinguishable from the negative
control using ﬂuorescence microscopy (Fig. 5B) Only slight differences were observed
between the different PETases. Signals obtained for the BSA control were clearly distin-
guishable from the PETase samples. HPLC measurements revealed TPA concentrations in
the reaction supernatants of 2.746 0.77
mM, 18.996 2.48 mM and 6.686 1.88 mMf o r
PET40, IsPETase, and LCC, respectively. No TPA was detected in the Incubations of PET
with BSA. Altogether, these data imply that ReporTPA_UHH04 is a very sensitive reporter
strain useful for the qualitative detection of enzymatic activity on PET.
DISCUSSION
One of the greatest challenges of our time is the environmental pollution by plastic
waste. It is therefore an urgent matter toﬁnd out to what extent microorganisms and
their enzymes can degrade synthetic polymers. Until now, the search for PET-degrading
enzymes has mainly relied on enrichment cultures and on homology-based searches using
simple sequence searches or more elaborated HMM proﬁles to identify possible plastic
degrading enzymes (13, 31, 32). As a result of this research, a signiﬁcant number of enzymes
active on PET, ester-based polyurethane (PUR) and polyamide (PA) oligomers have been
detected (seePAZy.eu
). While the identiﬁcation of these enzymes and their host microor-
ganisms has greatly advanced our understanding in the catalytic mode of hydrolysis, we still
have large knowledge gaps on the biological function, the diversity and evolution of such
enzymes. With this respect, the development of functional assays to measure their activities

in situand to enrich the diversity of plastic-active enzymes by detecting truly novel enzymes
by detecting their reaction products is an importantﬁeld of research.
Within this study, we have constructedC. thiooxidansreporter strains ReporTPA_UHH03
and UHH04 that are highly sensitive toward the detection of TPA. They strongly transcribe a
sfGFP gene fused to thetphC promoter with an up to 25-fold induction for UHH03 and up
to 19-fold induction for UHH04 with added gluconate. The most sensitive reporter strain
produced in this work, ReporTPA_UHH04, carries a deletion of the TPA degradation genes
and is not able to convert TPA as a carbon source. Therefore, TPA accumulates in the cells
and is responsible for the relatively high sensitivity.
Today, several methods are known to assess the degradation of PET by enzymes (14).
Table 3 summarizes the most frequently used methods to assess microbial PET degrada-
tion. While some methods simply aim at measuring weight loss, they bear the risk of mis-
interpretation of the degradation. This is linked to the presence of additives in most poly-
mers. More sophisticated methods aim at the direct or indirect quantitative detection of
the breakdown products. The breakdown products of PET like TPA, MHET, and/or BHET
are commonly analyzed by RP-HPLC analysis (11, 15). However, other approaches relying
on the absorption (33) orﬂuorescence (17–19) of PET breakdown products have also been
reported. One of the earliestﬂuorometric assays reported was based on iron autoxidation-
mediated generation of free hydroxyl radical (18).
Furthermore, previous research has identiﬁed regulatory circuits and genes involved in
the uptake of few of the polymer degradation products. Such genes and especially their
promoters can be harnessed to generate very speciﬁc biosensors (Table 3). For instance,
several transporters for TPA uptake had been reported (7, 21, 26) together with pathways
for its degradation (7, 25) Further, a very recent study hitchhiked this principle and devel-
oped a biosensor for TPA using the transcription factor XylS fromPseudomonas putida

ognize TPA at 10
mM concentration. Yet another study reported that the fusion of aluxAB
operon for online monitoring of a chemiluminescent signal allows the detection of TPA in
living cells (24). All these reporter strains build the basis for novel function-driven searches
and will allow to identify novel biodiversity.
Notably, bioassays vary greatly in their sensitivity. With respect to bioassays for the
detection of PET, the here developed reporter strain ReporTPA_UHH04, is probably the most
sensitive bioassay for TPA reported so far (Table 3). Furthermore, the strains and constructs
presented in this work can be constructed and employed relatively easy by simple 1:1 dilution
with liquid analytes such as enzymatic reaction supernatants providingﬂuorescent readouts

already after 2 to 4 h of incubation. This offers a great potential to identify novel PET-active
microorganisms and enzymes even with low activities. It also offers the possibility to monitor
the degradation in microbial consortia over time andin situ. Due to the accumulation of
TPA over time in the ReporTPA_UHH04 cells, we could non quantitatively detect the release
of TPA from PET by different PETase enzymes. Assays were performed already after a rela-
tively short incubation time of only 20 h on PET, releasing lower micromolar amounts of
TPA. Additional developments could be focused on modiﬁcation of screening conditions
to further shorten the assaying durations and possibly enabling quantitative evaluation
of PET breakdown.
Future work will now have to demonstrate the usefulness of the ReporTPA system
for environmental and biotechnological studies. Thereby, identifying novel and better
PET degrading microorganisms and enzymes will be a rewarding task. While bioassays are
now available for the detection of PET breakdown products, we lack such assays for poly-
mers like polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, polyvinyl chloride and ether-based PUR.
Thus, developing bioassays to monitor the possible degradation of these polymers is one of
the next major challenges.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Culturing conditions.Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1.E. colistrains
were routinely cultivated in lysogeny broth (LB) medium (34) supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics at
37°C. Comamonas thiooxidansstrains were cultivated either in LB or in Wx mineral medium (35) at 37°C, if not
stated otherwise.
Molecular cloning. Synthesis of the gene coding for PET40 (IMG Gene ID: Ga0074072_10050165)
was done by Biomatik (ON, Canada). Cloning of genetic fragments from different sources into target plasmids
was routinely performed through restriction-free cloning (36) using the corresponding primers listed in
Table 2. Genetic constructs were either transformed into chemically competentE. coliDH5
a cells through
heat shock at 42°C for 45 s or via electroporation into electrocompetentC. thiooxidanscells (1350 V, 600X,
10 mF, 1 mm). Electrocompetent cells were prepared by growing a 10 mL LB culture until an OD600 of 0.3
was reached followed by aliquoting the cells into 1 mL and washing them by resuspending the centri-
fuged cells three times with 1 mL ice-cold 10% (vol/vol) glycerol. Cells wereﬁnally resuspended in 100mL
10% (vol/vol) glycerol and stored at270°C until use.
Plasmid and genomic DNA isolation.Plasmid DNA for use as the template DNA in PCRs or for trans-
formation was routinely isolated fromE. coliDH5a cells using the Presto Mini Plasmid kit (GeneAid, New Taipei
City, Taiwan). Isolation of genomic DNA fromC. thiooxidansfor use as the template DNA in PCRs was performed
using the NucleoSpin Microbial DNA kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany).
Preparation of reporter cells for TPA assays.The C. thiooxidansS23 biosensor strains ReporTPA_UHH03
and UHH04 were prepared by growing them overnight at 130 rpm in 50 mL LB medium supplemented with
25 mgm L21 chloramphenicol in an Erlenmeyerﬂask.
Prior to TPA assays, the OD600 o ft h ec u l t u r e sw a sd e t e r m i n e da n das u i t a b l ec u l t u r ev o l u m ew a sc e n t r i f u g e d
at 4,500 rcf, 4°C for 5 min followed by resuspension of the pellet in 50 mL Wx medium containing 25mgm L21
chloramphenicol to reach aﬁnal OD600 of 0.6. Additionally, for experiments with ReporTPA_UHH04, the Wx me-
dium for resuspension was supplemented with 10 mM gluconate, if not stated otherwise. The resuspended cul-
tures were incubated at 37°C, 130 rpm for 30 min before addition to the samples.
Fluorescence assays withC. thiooxidansS23 ReporTPA_UHH03 and UHH04.For routine assaying
of liquid samples comprising either Wx medium containing different TPA concentrations or supernatants
from enzymatic reactions, 100
mL of sample was added to a well in a black-walled 96-well microtiter-plate forﬂu-
orescence-based assays (ThermoFisher, Waltham, MA, USA). A volume of 100mL of reporter cells, which were pre-
pared as described in the previous section, were added to the sample wells and the plate was incubated at 28°C
on a Vibration Shaker 3023 plate shaker (Gesellschaft für Labortechnik mbH, Burgwedel, Germany) at 150 rpm.
Fluorescence and OD
600 values throughout the incubation times were determined in 0.5 to 2 h intervals using a
Synergy HT plate reader using the Gen5 software (BioTek, Winooski, VT, USA).
Fluorescent microscopic imaging ofC. thiooxidans biosensor cells.Microscopic imaging of bio-
sensor cells was conducted using an Axio Observer.Z1/7 LSM 800 (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Jena,
Germany) confocal laser scanning microscope with a Plan-Apochromat 100/C2/1.40 Oil DIC M27 objective.
Evaluation and processing of obtained images was performed using ZEN software (Version 2.3, Carl
Zeiss Microscopy GmbH) and Fiji software v.1.53c (37).
Transcriptomic and differential expression analysis ofC. thiooxidansS23 cells.Cultures ofC. thi-
ooxidans S23 wild-type cells were grown in triplicate in 250 mL Wx minimal salt medium containing 10 mM ei-
ther TPA or succinate. Cells were harvested after reaching an OD
600 of 0.5, shock frozen on dry ice and stored at
280°C until further processing. Cell pellets were sent for RNA-sequencing to Vertis Biotechnologie AG (Freising,
Germany). Obtained raw reads were further processed in Geneious Prime 2021.1.1 (www.geneious.com)b y
quality control and trimming using BBDuk v.38.84 (38), mapping ontoC. thiooxidansS23 (DSM17888) ge-
nome (PATRIC Genome ID: 363952.7) with Bowtie2 (39) and subsequent calculation of expression levels
using Geneious Prime. Differential expression analysis was performed using DeSEQ2 v.1.36 (40). Raw reads
were deposited at the ENA under project accession number:PRJEB55783

Two-step allelic exchange for deletion of the catabolictphA2A3BA1 gene cluster inC. thiooxi-
dans S23. Deletion of the catabolictphA2A3BA1gene cluster inC. thiooxidansS23 was performed according
to reference (41). Homologous regions, designated A and B,ﬂanking thetphA2A3BA1genes 989 bp upstream
of tphA2 (A)and 993 bp downstream oftphA1 (B)were ampliﬁed fromC. thiooxidansgDNA using primer pairs
RF_FA_FW, RF_FA_RV and RF_FB_FW, RF_FB_RV. The correct product lengths were conﬁrmed via gel electro-
phoresis and the regions were joined via overlap extension PCR. The resulting fragment AB was cloned into
the suicide vector pNPTS138-R6KT::CmR via whole plasmid ampliﬁcation using overlaps complementary to the
target vector. Due to a natural kanamycin resistance ofC. thiooxidans, the template vector pNPTS138-R6KT::
CmR was constructed by replacing the kanamycin resistance gene in pNPTS138-R6KT with a chlorampheni-
col resistance gene from pBBR1MCS-1 using restriction-free cloning with the primers RF_CmR_in_pNPTS_FW
and RF_CmR_in_pNPTS_RV. The resulting construct pNPTS138-R6KT::CtAB::CmR was transformed into chemi-
cally competentE. coliWM3064 cells and plated on LB-agar containing 25
mgm L21 chloramphenicol and
30 mM diaminopimelic acid (DAP). Positive transformants were selected via antibiotic resistance and
sequencing using M13-20 fw and M13-20 rv primers. Integration of pNPTS138-R6KT::CtAB::CmR into theC.
thiooxidans S23 genome via allelic exchange was performed via conjugation by cocultivation ofC. thiooxi-
dans S23 andE. coliWM3064 harboring pNPTS138-R6KT::CtAB::CmR on LB-agar. After overnight incubation
at 37°C, grown cells were washed off with 2 mL LB medium, pelleted, washed two times with 1 mL LB me-
dium and plated out on LB agar containing 25mgm L21 chloramphenicol to select forC. thiooxidanswith
genomically integrated pNPTS138-R6KT::CtAB::CmR. A second selection step for cells having lost the inte-
grated plasmid sequence was carried out on LB-agar containing 10% sucrose for counterselection.
Resulting colonies were tested for their sensitivity toward chloramphenicol and growth capability on TPA.
The genomic DNA of cells unable to grow in the presence of Cm and TPA as sole carbon source was inves-
tigated by sequencing the region ampliﬁed using the primers Ct_ko_seq_FW and Ct_ko_seq_RV to verify
the successful deletion of thetphA2A3BA1 gene cluster.
Heterologous expression of PETase genes inEscherichia coli BL21(DE3). Recombinant protein
expression for the production of PET-degrading enzymes was performed usingE. coliBL21(DE3) harbor-
ing a novel PETase from our laboratory, PET40 (unpublished data) or leaf compost cutinase (LCC) (12) on
pET21a(1) expression plasmids orI. sakaiensis PETase (11) on a pMAL-p4x expression plasmid (Table 1).
Cells were grown at 37°C in 1 L ZYM-5052 auto induction medium (42) supplemented with 100
mg/mL
ampicillin under constant aeration. The cultures were relocated from 37°C to 22°C once an OD600 of 0.6
was reached and incubated further overnight for 16 to 20 h. Cells were harvested after overnight incuba-
tion by centrifugation and lysed using a French pressure cell press. Crude lysates were cleared by centrif-
ugation at 20,000 rcf for 20 min and the obtained supernatants were puriﬁed using either Ni-NTA aga-
rose (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) for polyhistidin-tagged proteins PET40 and LCC or amylose
resin (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) forIsPETase.
Incubation of PETase enzymes with PET substrates.Puriﬁed PETase enzymes were diluted to a
ﬁnal concentration of 0.1 mg mL
21 in Potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 8) and 200mLo fe n z y m es o l u -
tion were added to a well of a 96-Well Plate. Added PET substrates comprised of a PET foil platelet (Ø 6 mm,
amorphous PETﬁlm, Goodfellow GmbH, Bad Nauheim, Germany) which was rinsed in 96% Ethanol and dried
prior to addition to the well. Incubation was carried out for 20 h at 40°C on a thermomixer Comfort 5355
(Eppendorf SE, Hamburg, Germany) at 400 rpm. A 0.1 mg mL
21 Solution of Bovine serum albumin (BSA) in
Potassium phosphate buffer (0.1 M, pH 8) served as negative control for incubation.
HPLC analysis of enzymatic incubations with PET.The analysis of TPA concentrations in superna-
tants of enzymatic incubations with PET was performed using an UltiMate 3000 UHPLC system from Thermo
Scientiﬁc (Waltham, MA, USA). The system wasﬁtted with a Triart C18 column (YMC Europe GmbH, Dinslaken,
Germany) having a dimension of 100/C22.0 mm with 1.9
mm particle diameter. Isocratic elution was carried
out in a 20:80 (vol/vol) acetonitrile and water (acidiﬁed with 0.1% vol/vol triﬂuoroacetic acid) mobile phase at
0.4 mL min21. Samples were prepared from 50mL of incubation supernatant mixed with 200mL acetonitrile
(acidiﬁed with 1% vol. triﬂuoroacetic acid), followed by centrifugation at 10,000/C2g for 3 min. 200mLo ft h es u -
pernatant was transferred to 600mLw a t e r .1 5mL of sample were injected per measurement. Detection TPA
was carried out at 254 nm with a VWD-3400 detector from Thermo Scientiﬁc (Waltham, MA, USA). The quantiﬁ-
cation of peaks was performed with the data analysis software supplied with the Compass HyStar software
package from Bruker (Billerica, MA, USA).
Data availability.Raw reads of the transcriptomic analysis were deposited at the European nucleo-
tide archive ENA under project accession numberPRJEB55783.
