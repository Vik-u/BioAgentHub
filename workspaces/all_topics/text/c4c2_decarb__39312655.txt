Significance
 This study advances 
understanding of the cis-
regulatory mechanisms 
underpinning the evolution of C3 
and C4 photosynthesis in 
grasses. Leveraging cutting-edge 
single-cell assay for transposase 
accessible chromatin-sequencing 
technology, we reveal intricate 
cell-type-specific regulatory 
landscapes that delineate the 
evolutionary trajectory from C3 
to C4 photosynthesis. The 
comprehensive single-cell 
resolution cis-regulatory maps 
across five grass species, 
including both C3 and C4 types, 
uncover the dynamic interplay of 
gene co-option and evolutionary 
innovation driving this critical 
adaptation. These findings not 
only elucidate the genetic 
foundations of photosynthetic 
diversity, but also pave the way 
for future biotechnological 
approaches to improve crop 
resilience and efficiency under 
changing environments.

While considerable knowledge exists about the enzymes pivotal for C4 photosynthesis, 
much less is known about the cis- regulation important for specifying their expression in 
distinct cell types. Here, we use single- cell- indexed ATAC- seq to identify cell- type- specific 
accessible chromatin regions (ACRs) associated with C4 enzymes for five different grass 
species. This study spans four C4 species, covering three distinct photosynthetic subtypes: 
Zea mays and Sorghum bicolor (NADP- dependent malic enzyme), Panicum miliaceum 
(NAD- dependent malic enzyme), Urochloa fusca (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykin-
ase), along with the C3 outgroup Oryza sativa. We studied the cis- regulatory landscape 
of enzymes essential across all C4 species and those unique to C 4 subtypes, measuring 
cell- type- specific biases for C4 enzymes using chromatin accessibility data. Integrating 
these data with phylogenetics revealed diverse co- option of gene family members between 
species, showcasing the various paths of C4 evolution. Besides promoter proximal ACRs, 
we found that, on average, C4 genes have two to three distal cell- type- specific ACRs, high-
lighting the complexity and divergent nature of C4 evolution. Examining the evolutionary 
history of these cell- type- specific ACRs revealed a spectrum of conserved and novel ACRs, 
even among closely related species, indicating ongoing evolution of cis- regulation at these 
C4 loci. This study illuminates the dynamic and complex nature of cis- regulatory elements 
evolution in C4 photosynthesis, particularly highlighting the intricate cis- regulatory evolu-
tion of key loci. Our findings offer a valuable resource for future investigations, potentially 
aiding in the optimization of C3 crop performance under changing climatic conditions.
C4 Photosynthesis | Cis- regulation | Plant Genomics | Regulatory Evolution | Single- cell
 Photosynthesis is one of the most critical chemical reactions on the planet whereby CO2  
is metabolized into glucose. Plants have evolved numerous variations of photosynthesis. 
The most common type of photosynthesis uses the enzyme ribulose 1,5-biphosphate 
carboxylase oxygenase (RuBisCO) which combines CO 2  with a five-carbon compound 
ribulose 1,5-biphosphate to create 3-phosphoglyceric acid. This three-carbon compound 
is then used in a redox reaction within the Calvin Benson cycle, where sucrose is made. 
The production of this three-carbon compound is what gives this type of photosynthesis, 
C3 , its name. However, although widely evolved and found in many crop plants, C 3  
photosynthesis struggles to perform in hot, arid conditions. In nonideal conditions, O 2  
can competitively bind the RuBisCO active site, causing the formation of a toxic inter­
mediate, and reducing photosynthetic efficiency and plant performance ( 1 ). Due to 
increasing temperature caused by anthropogenic climate change, this reduction in pho­
tosynthetic capacity for key crop plants poses a major agricultural challenge ( 2 ). However, 
other types of photosynthesis have evolved in hotter conditions and offer a model to 
potentially alter key C3  crop plants to be more efficient.
 The C4  photosynthetic pathway is an example of a modified style of photosynthesis 
that is able to perform in hot conditions. In brief, C 4  typically works by sequestering 
key photosynthetic enzymes into two different compartments in the leaf made up of 
different cell types. These two cell types/compartments are bundle sheath (BS) cells, 
which in C4  plants generally form a concentric ring around the vasculature, and mes­
ophyll (MS) cells, which make up large portions of the nonvascularized leaf internal 
cells ( 3 ). In the MS, CO2  is imported and converted to bicarbonate (HCO 3 − ) by the 
enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA). Bicarbonate is then converted to a four- carbon 
molecule oxaloacetate (OAA) by the O2- insensitive phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 
(PEPC). This OAA molecule made of a four- carbon compound (where C 4  derives its 
name) is finally converted into a stable metabolite, either malate or aspartate. This 
intermediate molecule is then transported to the BS where it undergoes a decarboxy­
lation process, by one of three different types of decarboxylases, NAD- dependent malic

enzyme (NAD-ME), NADP-dependent malic enzyme (NADP - 
ME), or phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK). This 
decarboxylation reaction releases a CO 2  molecule that enters 
into the Calvin Benson cycle. The generation and processing of 
intermediate molecules in cellular compartments allows for 
concentrated levels of CO 2  to interact with RuBisCO, reducing 
the inefficiencies mentioned above. Additional types of C 4  pho­
tosynthesis have been observed which do not rely on division 
of metabolites between MS and BS cell types, but instead rely 
on using dimorphic chloroplast instead as in the species 
 Bienertia sinuspersici  ( 4 ,  5 ). Current C4  crops such as maize 
(Zea mays ), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor ), pearl millet (Cenchrus 
americanus ), foxtail millet (Setaria italica ), and broomcorn mil­
let (Panicum miliaceum ) excel in their ability to operate in 
adverse conditions.
 Although the evolution of C4  photosynthesis is a complex pro­
cess, there is tantalizing evidence that engineering C3  crops to do 
C4  photosynthesis might be possible. One piece of evidence that 
points to this is that C4  photosynthesis has evolved independently 
65 times in different lineages of plants ( 6 ). These results indicate 
that most plant lineages have the genetic material capable of evolv­
ing into C4  photosynthesizers. The Poaceae  lineage of grasses exem­
plifies this, as C4  photosynthesis has evolved independently at least 
18 times ( 7 ). Interestingly, all of these species use the same core 
C4  enzymes and steps, but many use different decarboxylation 
enzymes as mentioned above ( 8   – 10 ). Furthering this hypothesis 
is the fact that many C 4 -related genes originally evolved from 
either C3  photosynthetic genes or key enzymes critical in core 
metabolism ( 11 ,  12 ). For instance, PEPC is a key metabolism 
enzyme in the glycolytic pathways of the Krebs Cycle, with some 
copies being important in guard cell metabolism ( 13   – 15 ). Instead 
of novel gene content being the main driver of C4  photosynthesis, 
it is more likely due to the correct timing and compartmentaliza­
tion of key enzymes into specific cell types ( 16   – 18 ). This raises 
the question of how is gene expression of these key C 4  enzymes 
regulated. Moreover, as C 4  has evolved multiple times conver­
gently, have similar regulatory networks and paradigms been 
co-opted to alter when and where these key genes are expressed?
 cis- regulatory elements (CREs) are key players in gene regu­
lation, as they both fine- tune expression and provide cell- type 
specificity ( 19     – 22 ). In brief, these regions operate as binding 
sites for transcription factors (TFs). TFs are proteins which are 
able to alter transcription by binding DNA sequences and 
recruiting transcriptional machinery which can either increase 
or decrease transcription ( 23 ). Thus TFs are able to significantly 
change molecular phenotypes. Previous work has shown that 
CREs could be key players in the transition to C 4  photosynthe ­
sis. This was demonstrated by taking C 4  genes from Z. mays  and 
transforming them into Oryza sativa,  a C 3  species ( 24 ,  25 ), 
which revealed that CREs from Z. mays  genes were able to drive 
cell-type-specific expression in MS in O. sativa  ( 24 ,  25 ). 
Additional analyses have implicated CREs as drivers in the evo ­
lution of C 4  photosynthesis. In the genus of plants Flaveria,  
which contains both C 4  and C3  plants, one key difference in C4  
plants was a specific CRE driving gene expression in MS cells. 
This 41 bp motif named Mesophyll expression module 1  is critical 
for cell- type-specific expression of PEPC  in MS cells, a critical 
first step in the C 4  pathway ( 19 ,  26 ). Finally, four conserved 
noncoding sequences were identified to be critical in MS- specific 
expression of PEPC  in monocots ( 27 ). Furthermore, a recent 
cross-species study examining the binding sites of GLK, a con­
served TF regulating photosynthetic genes, revealed that CREs 
can undergo rapid changes and result in diverse gene expression 
patterns without the need of altering the TF itself ( 28 ). These 
findings show that CREs are important genetic elements that 
plants use for the evolution of C 4  photosynthesis.
 Although some CREs critical for cell-type-specific expression 
of key photosynthetic genes have been identified, they’ve been 
restricted to those nearby the transcriptional start sites. This is 
due, in part, to the challenge of identifying CREs genome wide, 
as well as limitations in the isolation of BS and MS cells which is 
labor intensive and challenging. However, a recent study used a 
multiomic approach in Z. mays  BS and MS cells and found CREs 
genome-wide that might be critical in the cell-type-specific regu­
lation of genes ( 29 ). One example is the identification of a poten­
tial distal CRE ~40 kb upstream of SULFATE TRANSPORTER4  
(ZmSFP4 ), a BS-specific sulfate transporter ( 29 ). These results 
highlight the complexity of identifying loci involved in cis  regu­
lation. Identifying all CREs associated with C 4  loci is critical in 
enhancing our understanding of cis  regulation of key C 4  genes, 
and would greatly enhance attempts at engineering C 3  crops. 
During the evolution of C4  photosynthesis, it is unclear whether 
these CREs have been preestablished during evolution and 
co-opted for C4  photosynthesis or if they evolved independently 
numerous times. Understanding the ways in which cis  regulation 
evolves to control timing and cell-type-specific expression of C 4  
photosynthesis genes would greatly assist efforts in engineering 
C3  plants to be more C4 -like.
 T o investigate the role of CREs and their potential contribution 
in controlling key C4  genes, we used single-cell indexed assay for 
transposase accessible chromatin sequencing (sciATAC-seq) to 
identify cell-type-specific CREs from five grass species represent­
ing diverse C4  subtypes, as well as an additional C3  outgroup. We 
investigated the cell-type specificity of both the core C4  enzymes, 
and those which are unique to each photosynthetic subtype. 
Further, we identify CREs of C4  genes and find cell-type-specific 
CREs that might be critical in C 4  gene expression. We find that 
some of these regulatory regions appear not just conserved in a 
single C4  subtype, but in all of the C4  species we studied. Finally, 
we leverage these data to find TF binding motifs enriched in MS 
and BS cell types and use these motifs to catalog these regulatory 
loci. 
Results
Identification and Annotation of Cell Types in Diverse Species. 
T o investigate CREs in BS and MS cells potentially important in 
C4 photosynthesis, we generated replicated sciATAC- seq libraries 
for four different C4 species, comprising three different C4 subtypes 
NADP- ME (Z. mays, S. bicolor), NAD- ME (P . miliaceum), and 
PEPCK (Urochloa fusca), and a C 3 outgroup species (O. sativa) 
(Fig.  1A). Libraries were filtered for high- quality cells by first 
pseudobulking the sciATAC- seq libraries, and identifying accessible 
chromatin regions (ACRs). Using these ACRs, per nuclei quality 
metrics were then calculated such as fraction of reads in peaks, 
transcriptional start site enrichment, and total integration events 
per nucleus (Methods). Nuclei found to have a high proportion 
of organellar reads were also removed, with values being adjusted 
on a per library basis (Methods). Clustering of cells was done on 
genomic bins, and with additional cells removed that had a high 
correlation with in silico generated doublets, and clusters were 
removed that were skewed toward one replicate by greater than 
75% (Methods). After filtering on per nucleus quality metrics, we 
identified 16,060 nuclei in Z. mays, 15,301 nuclei in S. bicolor, 
7,081 nuclei in P . miliaceum, 19,110 nuclei in U. fusca, and 5,952 
nuclei in O. sativa (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 and Dataset S1).
 Due to variation in genome size and content, cell-type anno­
tation for each dataset was done independently using the reference

genome for each species ( Fig. 1B  ). We used multiple approaches to 
annotate cell types. Orthologs of key marker genes from Z. 
mays  and O. sativa  were identified using a phylogenetics-based 
approach (Methods ). This allowed for the identification of marker 
genes for specific cell types in a cross-species context. T o gauge 
gene activity of these marker genes, gene body chromatin acces­
sibility was used as a proxy for expression ( Fig. 1D  ) ( 21 ,  30 ). 
Cell-type annotation was done manually taking into consideration 
marker gene chromatin accessibility, marker enrichment in clus­
ters, as well as ontological relationships between cell types 
(SI Appendix, Figs. S2–S19 ). Due to the lack of marker genes for 
many cell types in plants, as well as the challenge of annotating a 
broad sample of species, we reduced resolution of our annotation 
across our datasets to ensure accurate comparisons between vari­
able species ( Fig. 1B  ). All markers used to annotate cell types in 
this manuscript can be found in Dataset S2 .
 Deeper exploration of the list of marker genes from Z. mays  
showed conservation of gene body chromatin accessibility in 
markers for certain cell types (Datasets S2  and S3 ). As expected, 
for the C4  plants, RIBULOSE BISPHOSPHATE CARBOXYLASE 
SMALL SUBUNIT1 (RBCS1) and RIBULOSE BISPHOSPHATE 
CARBOXYLASE SMALL SUBUNIT2  ( RBCS2 ) were enriched 
in BS cells compared to MS cells ( Fig. 1C  ), a pattern that was 
not found in O. sativa.  Additionally, PEPC1  showed MS-specific 
chromatin accessibility in all of the C4  species sampled ( Fig. 1D  ). 
Additionally, we found conservation of marker genes like 
 SUCROSE TRANSPORTER 1  (SUT1 ) in companion cells and 
sieve elements, and GLOSSY1  ( GL1 ) in epidermis cells, indi­
cating that these historically described marker genes are likely 
important in this diverse set of species. This analysis provides 
an examination of core- C4  marker genes’ chromatin accessibility 
across a diverse sample of plant species at cell- type resolution.  
Chromatin Accessibility of Core C4 Enzymes Shows Similar Cell- 
Type Bias, but Differing Evolutionary Origins.  We measured 
the chromatin accessibility bias of the C 4- associated enzymes. 
Due to the diverse nature of the plants sampled, and the C 4 
photosynthetic subtypes, we separated enzymes into core-  and 
subtype- specific groups. This list comprised nine core C4 enzymes, 
and nine variable enzymes. These enzymes were assigned to one 
of these two groups based on if they are found in all C4 subtypes 
(core) or are specific to only one or two subtypes (variable). One

example of a core enzyme is carbonic anhydrase, which is used to 
generate bicarbonate from CO2, as well as for the regeneration of 
phosphoenolpyruvate from oxaloacetate in the BS cells by means 
of PEPCK (Fig. 2A). The list of gene families that we considered 
as core or variable is found in Dataset S3.
 T o investigate the cell-type bias of these enzymes, we used chro­
matin accessibility of the gene (gene body as well as 500 bp 
upstream of the transcriptional start site) ( Fig. 2B  ). Cell-type bias 
was calculated as the log2  fold change of BS/MS chromatin acces­
sibility. In order to identify core C4  enzymes across these species, 
we used OrthoFinder, named and numbered the enzyme models 
based off of their relatedness to Z. mays  copies of known core C4  
genes ( 31 ). Using only cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility 
data, we observed expected cell-type bias with many orthologs of 
the maize MS-specific core C4  genes showing MS-specific bias as 
compared to BS ( Fig. 2C  ). For instance, in all C4  species, PEPCK , 
which regenerates PEP from OAA in BS cells, always showed a 
BS-specific bias ( Fig. 2 A  and C  ). Additionally, PEPC , which con­
verts bicarbonate to OAA in MS cells, showed MS-specific bias 
for all species sampled, except the C 3  outgroup O. sativa  ( Fig. 2 
 A  and C  ). These results highlight the quality of the data and the 
cell-type annotations for these single-cell datasets.
 When analyzing these data in tandem with the phylogenetic trees, 
we noticed that some of the key enzymes showed different cell-type 
specificity based on their evolutionary origin (SI Appendix, Figs. S21 
and S22 ). For instance, for carbonic anhydrase in P . miliaceum,  the 
orthologs that showed the largest bias between MS and BS cell types 
were not the copies that were the most evolutionary closely related 
to the Z. mays  and S. bicolor  cell-type-specific copies (Here PmCA1  
and PmCA2 ). Rather, a copy found in a separate clade (PmCA3 ) 
showed the most MS- specific bias ( Fig. 2C  ). This indicates that 
during the evolution of C4 , different sets of carbonic anhydrases 
were likely co-opted. One challenge using chromatin accessibility 
in this context, however, is the fact that neighboring gene models 
can occlude cell-type-specific signals. For instance, in the S. bicolor  
copy of RBCS1 , a BS-specific gene has a neighboring gene model 
directly upstream which shares a promoter region making measure­
ment of the cell-type-specific bias of some loci challenging when 
using chromatin accessibility data (SI Appendix, Fig. S23 ).
 One unexpected result from this analysis was the lack of 
cell-type-specific bias for MALATE PHOSPHATE ANTIPORT 1 
(DIC1),  also known as DICARBOXYLATE/TRICARBOXYLATE 
TRANSPORTER 1  (DTC1 ) in Z. mays . It has been previously 
reported that DIC1  had BS-specific expression bias in Z. mays  as 
well as in P . miliaceum  ( 32   – 34 ). However, there is not a clear signal 
based on the chromatin accessibility data. This could indicate that 
some ACRs harbor multiple CREs active in different cell types 
that are not obvious in chromatin accessibility data or that the 
cell-type-specificity observed is not due to cis -regulation, possibly 
involving posttranscriptional processes ( Fig. 2C  ). Last, as expected, 
there was very little bias in the C3  outgroup (O. sativa ). In total, 
12/13 of the core C4  enzymes showed cell-type-specific bias in Z. 
mays , 7/12 in S. bicolor , 16/21 in P . miliaceum , 11/13 in U. fusca , 
and finally 0/16 in O. sativa . These data demonstrate that 
chromatin-accessibility data can be leveraged to investigate the 
cell-type regulation of C4  genes while also taking into considera­
tion their evolutionary relationships in a cross-species context.  
Key C 4 Subtype Genes Show Potential Convergent Evolution 
in Cell- Type- Specific Bias. We investigated the variable enzymes 
that give each C 4 subtype its unique properties by focusing 
on two species (S. bicolor and Z. mays) from the NADP- ME

phylogenetically.

subtype (Fig. 3A). As expected, chromatin accessibility bias was 
observed for enzymes previously reported as having cell- type- 
specific expression patterns, similarly to the core C 4 enzyme 
set (29, 35). Reassuringly, one of the most biased enzymes 
identified was NADP- ME, the key enzyme of the redox step in 
NADP- ME subtypes. More specifically, of the multiple copies 
of NADP- ME that exist in Z. mays, we observed the expected 
cell- type bias for the known BS- specific copy, ME3, a key factor 
in C4 (here ZmNADP- ME1) (Fig. 3B). We noticed in S. bicolor, 
the BS- specific NADP- ME and the MS- specific NADP- malate 
dehydrogenase (NADP- MDH) gene copies are recent tandem 
duplications, each maintaining their respective cell- type specific 
chromatin accessibility (Fig. 3 B and C and SI Appendix, Figs. S22 
and S23). The malate transporters DICARBOXYLIC ACID 
TRANSPORTER1/2 (DIT1/2) also demonstrated their expected 
cell- type- specific bias with DIT1 being MS specific and DIT2 
being BS specific in both species (Fig. 3 B and C). However, upon 
further inspection of the phylogenies of the DITs in S. bicolor, 
we noticed a pattern where the most BS- biased copy, SbDIT4 
(Sobic.004G035500), was phylogenetically more closely related 
to the ZmDIT1. Something which has been previously reported 
(33, 36). These results indicate that over evolutionary time, even 
members of the same C 4 photosynthetic subtype, which likely 
share a C4 ancestor, can use different paralogous loci to achieve 
cell- type- specific expression. This highlights that C4 evolution is 
an ongoing process.
 NAD-ME subtypes in P . miliaceum  are interesting, as the inter­
mediate molecule being passed between MS and BS does not take 
the form of malate, but instead aspartate, alanine, and oxaloacetate 
( Fig. 3D  ). At least one gene copy of all the key redox enzymes, 
 NAD-ME  and the NAD-dependent malate dehydrogenase  (NAD- 
MDH ), show BS-biased chromatin accessibility ( Fig. 3 E  and F  ). 
Interestingly, of the three copies of NAD-MDH  analyzed, only 
two showed bias for BS. Next, we evaluated two key enzymes

associated with the generation of critical intermediate metabolites, 
Aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT), and Alanine aminotrans­
ferase (AlaAT). It has been reported that some AspAT have 
cell-type-specific expression patterns, with the MS-specific copy 
of the protein being transported to the cytosol and the BS-specific 
copy being transported to the mitochondria ( Fig. 3 E  and F  ) 
( 37   – 39 ). Of the four copies of AspAT we examined, two 
(PmAspAT3/4 ) showed significant MS-specific bias, whereas the 
other two copies (PmAspAT1/2 ) did not show significant deviation 
toward BS ( Fig. 3E  ). This possibly indicates differing levels of 
regulation for the AspAT copies that did not show the expected 
BS bias, or missing copies of AspAT that we have not investigated. 
Within AlaAT , however, we identified one copy, PmAlaAT1,  show­
ing MS-specific bias, and PmAlaAT6  showing BS-specific bias; 
something that has been previously hypothesized based on bio­
chemical information ( 40 ). Additionally, somewhat unexpectedly 
is that we did not observe clear bias for sodium bile acid symporters 
(BASS ) and sodium:hydrogen antiporters (NHD ) ( Fig. 3E  ). These 
two proteins together form a functioning sodium bile acid sym­
porter system, which balances the ratio of sodium and is important 
in the transport of pyruvate into the chloroplast of MS cells ( 41 ). 
Although two copies of the BASS  genes were MS biased, only a 
single copy of NHD  was slightly MS biased. Surprisingly, we do 
observe slight cell-type-specific chromatin accessibility bias for 
malate transporter DIT1/DIT2  in P . miliaceum . This is somewhat 
surprising, as malate is not the main 4-carbon intermediate used 
by NAD-ME subtypes ( 10 ). This highlights the flexible nature of 
 P . miliaceum  in terms of its C4  photosynthetic style, as it has been 
implicated that it can perform some of the metabolite shuttling 
as the NADP-ME subtype ( 10 ,  42 ,  43 ). The potential flexibility 
of P . miliaceum  in its style of C4  makes it an extremely interesting 
species to study, especially when considering that it does not share 
common C4  ancestry with Z. mays  or S. bicolor.  This lack of evo­
lutionary relationship between P . miliaceum  and S. bicolor  and  
 Z. mays  makes the comparison between P .miliaceum  and its closer 
relativeU. fusca  all the more valuable. These observations point to 
the complicated nature of some of these C 4  photosynthetic sub­
types. While the obvious subtype-specific enzymes show expected 
chromatin-accessibility bias, others do not.
 Using the PEPCK  subtype in U. fusca,  we evaluated cell-type 
bias of enzymes that operate as an intermediate between NAD-ME 
and NADP-ME subtypes ( Fig. 3G  ). Copies of NAD-ME  and 
 PEPCK  showed significant BS bias ( Fig. 3 H  and I  ). Additionally, 
 NADP-MDH  was significantly biased toward MS, reflecting its 
critical role in the regeneration of malate from pyruvate ( Fig. 3H  ). 
We also observed one copy of BASS,  which was heavily MS biased, 
as well as the only copy of NHD  being highly MS biased ( Fig. 3G  ) 
( 44 ). Within the BASS  family, based on the phylogenies, it appears 
one clade of BASS  genes was co-opted to be MS specific, whereas 
the other clade remained somewhat BS specific. This potentially 
indicates that this co-opted clade may have been predisposed for 
C4  photosynthesis at the common ancestor of P . miliaceum  and 
 U. fusca.  Additionally, we also find one MS-biased and one 
BS-biased version of AlaAT ( Fig. 3H  ).
 Finally, when evaluating genes in the C3  outgroup O. sativa,  
we only observed significant chromatin accessibility bias for three 
of the 14 enzymes. This is expected given the overall lack of enzy­
matic bias seen in C3  species ( Fig. 3K  ). Interestingly though, we 
did find a single instance where one copy of AspAT  is BS specific, 
suggesting that this copy of AspAT  might slowly be co-opted into 
being more BS-specific ( Fig. 3K  ). Even more interesting is the 
slight BS-specific bias of the rice NAD-MDH , a BS-specific 
enzyme in the NAD-ME  subtypes. These results show a series of 
complex evolutionary relationships where many different genes 
can be co-opted into the C 4  pathway and highlight the myriad 
ways in which C4  evolution occurs.  
Cell- Type- Specific ACRs of Both Core -  and Subtype - Specific 
Enzymes. Although measuring the gene body chromatin access­
ibility of C 4 enzymes is valuable, it does not inform us about 
the cell- type- specific cis- regulatory environment controlling these 
genes, as we only included 500 bp upstream in this initial analysis. 
T o identify all potential CREs important for regulation of C 4 
enzymes, we identified cell- type- specific ACRs using a modified 
entropy metric (Methods; SI  Appendix, Figs.  S36 and S37). In 
short, cell- type- specific ACRs are those which are unique to either 
a single cell- type or two or three cell types in contrast to broadly 
accessible ACRs which are accessible in many different cell types. 
For each C 4 enzyme, in both the core and the noncore set, we 
identified ACRs around them. We only considered ACRs to be 
potential regulators of a locus based on distance, with assigned 
ACRs needing to be less than 200 kb away from the target enzyme, 
and requiring that no other gene intervenes between the ACR and 
enzyme in question. In total, across all variable and core enzymes 
and taking into consideration only C 4 species, we find that on 
average, C4 genes have between 2 and 3 cell- type- specific ACRs, 
with an additional 2 to 3 broadly accessible ACRs (Fig. 4A and 
Dataset S5).
 For all C4  subtypes, the key redox enzymes all showed BS 
cell-type-specific ACRs, potentially identifying critical CREs for 
proper cell- type-specific expression. For instance, in Z. mays, 
NADP-ME1  had five BS-specific ACRs, in S. bicolor, NADP-ME2  
had five BS -specific ACRs, in P . miliaceum, NAD- ME1  had 
four BS- specific ACRs, and in U. fusca, PEPCK,  had three 
BS-specific ACRs ( Fig. 4 A  and C  ). Additionally, of the MS- 
specific enzymes, we consistently observed numerous cell- type- 
specific ACRs around the carbonic anhydrase family. On aver ­
age, there were 3.5 MS- specific ACRs for each copy of carbonic 
anhydrase across all of the species. This likely reflects the fact 
that carbonic anhydrase is critical in the initial steps of C 4 , and 
also important in CO 2  sensing ( 45 ). We also noticed an intrigu­
ing pattern where enzymes which were accessible in one cell 
type had cell- type-specific ACRs of the other cell type. For 
instance, around RBCS2,  a BS-specific enzyme, we found a series 
of MS- specific ACRs ( Fig. 4D  ). On average, we found 2.5 
BS-specific ACRs around RBCS  and 1.5 MS-specific ACRs. This 
contrasting pattern was observed in key photosynthetic enzymes 
in all of the C4  subtypes. This likely indicates that some of these 
ACRs contain CREs that negatively regulate RBCS  in MS, as 
cell-type-specific CRE usage has been implicated as being an 
important driver in proper compartmentalization ( 46 ,  47 ). The 
identification of ACRs around key C 4  enzymes provides a 
detailed map about potential cis-  regulators of these loci, which 
provides the basis for future investigation into the direct function 
of each of these ACRs and how they might be altering transcrip­
tion in multiple different ways. These results show that there are 
likely multiple ACRs important to cell- type specificity of these 
enzymes.
 T raditionally, the field has focused on cis- regulation within a 
set distance from the transcriptional start site, often 1 to 2 kb, 
which is thought to generally encompass the promoter ( 48 ). 
However, we observed abundant distal cell-type-specific ACRs for 
many of these key genes ( Fig. 4B  ). For instance, the average dis­
tance of an ACR to its C4  enzyme is 10,080 bp (Z. mays ), 3,017 
bp (S.bicolor ), 4,260 bp (P . miliaceum ), 2,358 bp (U. fusca ), and 
4,730 bp (O. sativa ), indicating that the cis -regulatory space for 
these enzymes is far greater than previously appreciated, where a 
majority of the focus in the literature is on putative promoters.

T o test this, we compared the identified ACRs to a series of pre­
viously reported cloned promoters. We found that for Z. mays  and 
 S. bicolor  the ACR space identified includes significantly more 
regions that are distal to their target gene (SI Appendix, Fig. S25C   
and Dataset S6 ) ( 25 ,  49 ,  50 ).
 The genome of Z. mays  emphasizes this point, as the subtype- 
specific enzyme NADP-ME  has three cell-type-specific BS ACRs 
distal to the transcriptional start site, with the furthest being 34,336 
bp away ( Fig. 4C  ). These distal ACRs provide critical regulatory 
loci to further investigate. Interestingly, we found some enzyme/
ACR pairs with opposite cell- type-specificity (i.e., BS- specific 
enzyme, MS-specific ACR). Many of these ACRs were distally 
located. For example, in Z. mays,  the MS-specific ACR of RBCS  
was 36,171 bp upstream ( Fig. 4D  ). When investigating ACRs 
around promoters, we were struck at how often cell-type-specific 
ACRs occurred outside of the bounds of previously analyzed pro­
moters. For example, in PEPC  in P . miliaceum , a recent analysis 
demonstrated that a series of conserved noncoding sequences 
found between species were able to drive MS expression ( 27 ). 
When we looked at chromatin accessibility data of the promoter 
fragment which was cloned from PEPC , we identified many 
MS-specific ACRs within the cloned fragment, but an additional 
one upstream. This result shows the advantage of using 
scATAC-seq data to identify candidate CREs for certain genes, 
removing the guesswork of cloning fragments to investigate and 
providing a detailed cell-type-specific regulatory map of the locus 
( Fig. 4E  ). Thus, scATAC-seq greatly improves the search space of 
the active CREs potentially driving cell-type-specific gene expres­
sion patterns.  
The Evolutionary Relationships of ACRs Associated with C4 Genes 
Are Complex and Variable.  Next, we explored the evolutionary 
histories of these ACRs. Due to the fact that the C 4 subtypes 
come from different radiation events, (with Z. mays and S. bicolor 
likely sharing a C4 ancestor and U. fusca and P . miliaceum sharing 
a different C 4 ancestor), we were curious to evaluate whether a 
majority of the ACR space around these genes were either novel, or 
shared among these species. We implemented a pairwise sequence- 
based approach by identifying sequence conservation of ACRs 
between the study species using BLAST (SI Appendix, Supplemental 
Methods). The majority of important C4 genes have both novel and 
conserved ACRs. For example, PPDK, a MS- specific enzyme, shares 
~25% of its ACRs across all species examined including the O. sativa 
C3 outgroup (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, RUBISCO ACTIVASE (RCA), 
a critical enzyme in photosynthesis which removes inhibitory 
molecules from the RuBisCO active site, had novel ACRs in all 
the C4 species examined, whereas RCA in the C3 species O. sativa 
shared one ACR with all the C4 species. This might indicate that 
each of the C4 species gained regulatory sequences at RCA or that 
O. sativa might have lost them (Fig. 5A). Focusing on NADP- ME 
revealed notable divergence in its associated ACRs, even among 
closely related species. For example, in Z. mays, two out of nine 
ACRs linked to NADP- ME1 were unique, lacking counterparts 
in other species (Fig. 5A). This is particularly striking given that  
S. bicolor, belonging to the same C4 subtype, diverged from Z. mays 
only 13 mya (51). Similarly, in S. bicolor, the BS- specific NADP- 
ME2 variant exhibited two out of five unique ACRs. This pattern 
underscores the rapid and distinct evolutionary trajectories of ACRs 
in C4 plants. A full list of gene families, and gene models, and their 
relative conservation is found in SI Appendix, Fig. S26A. Using this 
same approach to study all of the core class of C4 enzymes did not 
reveal a generalizable pattern associated with gain or loss of ACRs 
around C4 genes (SI Appendix, Fig. S26A). Our findings not only 
confirm the dynamic evolution of cis- regulatory sequences in C4 
enzymes but also align with existing research that highlights rapid 
cis- regulatory changes among closely related species (48, 52).
 While investigating the ACRs around the C4  genes is interest­
ing, understanding how cell-type specificity is achieved across C4  
subtypes is needed for efforts to engineer C4  photosynthesis. When 
looking at just the cell-type-specific ACRs around key C4  loci, we 
find a similar pattern where there is a mix of both conserved and 
novel ACRs. For example, we found that some of the MS-specific

ACRs associated with PPDK  and PEPC  are highly conserved in 
all of the studied species. Interestingly, the MS-specific ACRs 
around PEPC  were only found in the C4  species, and not in the 
C3  outgroup, O. sativa  ( Fig. 5B  ). This indicates that some of the 
CREs that allow PEPC  expression in MS likely evolved after the 
split between the most recent common ancestors. We also observed 
that NADP-ME  possessed numerous BS- specific ACRs that 
were conserved in all species, including O. sativa  ( Fig. 5B  ). 
Considering proper compartmentalization of NADP- ME  in 
BS cells is only critical in two of the three C 4  subtypes, this 
was surprising. However, in both S. bicolor  and Z. mays , there 
were novel BS-specific ACRs associated with each key NADP-ME . 
In Z. mays,  one out of the five BS-specific ACRs was novel to  
 Z. mays , and in S. bicolor  two out of the five were novel to S. bicolor.  
Upon inspection of all the NADP-ME  loci in genome browsers, 
we were struck by the complexities and shuffling that occurred at 
these BS cell-type-specific ACRs ( Fig. 5C  ). These results highlight 
that extensive cis- regulatory evolution is occurring in each of these 
species, and on a cell- type-specific level. Additionally, this may 
point to the fact that the novel BS-specific ACRs found in S. bicolor  
and Z. mays  may be more important for proper BS-specific expres­
sion than the conserved regulatory elements.
 Although binary classification of ACRs was useful to decipher 
larger scale patterns between key enzymes, we next tested whether 
larger segments of sequence were conserved around some C4  genes 
as compared to others. We profiled the relative amount of con­
served sequence at each of these ACRs, as alignment of sequence 
between species gives greater resolution about important ACRs. 
One interesting observation from this analysis was the fact that the 
cell-type-specific ACRs around PEPCK  appear to be novel between 
 Z. mays  and U. fusca  ( Fig. 5D   and SI Appendix, Figs. S26–S31 ). 
This suggests that these regulatory loci emerged independently, and 
yet are still likely important in cell- type-specific expression of 
 PEPCK . Additionally, around the NAD-ME  loci in P . miliaceum , 
we found diverse evolutionary histories with both copies NAD-ME1  
and NAD-ME2  having both conserved and novel BS-specific ACRs 
(one out of four ACRs were novel for NAD-ME1 , and zero out of 
the two were conserved for NAD-ME2 ) ( Fig. 5D  ). The ACRs from 
 NADP-ME1  are conserved in U. fusca , whereas all three BS-specific 
ACRs are conserved in relation to P . miliaceum.  Pointing to the fact 
that the ACRs have likely maintained their cell-type specificity, and 
are likely critical drivers in the correct expression of NAD-ME  loci. 
These results highlight the dynamic evolution of cell-type-specific 
ACRs around key C4  loci, and that even closely related subtypes 
have evolved novel ACRs potentially critical in terms of proper gene 
expression, as well as compartmentalization.  
Identification of De Novo TF- Binding Motifs from Cell- Type- Specific 
Chromatin Data Reveals Rapid Sequence Diversification of ACRs. 
Leveraging the cell- type- resolved datasets, we identified de novo cell- 
type- specific TF motifs in BS and MS ACRs (Fig. 6 A and B; Methods; 
and SI Appendix, Fig. S32). We selected the BS- specific motifs based 
on motif similarity within C4 species for BS, and motif similarity seen 
across all species for MS. Additionally for the identification of BS- 
specific motifs, we identified motifs which did not appear to have a 
corresponding motif in O. sativa (SI Appendix, Supplemental Methods). 
Reassuringly, within the BS- specific motifs, we identified a DOF 
TF motif, which is a key driver in the switch to C4 photosynthesis 
(29, 53, 54). In brief, the DOF TFs have been implicated as being 
potential drivers of proper gene expression in Z. mays C 4 genes, 
both as repressors and activators. For example, ZmDOF30 has been 
implicated as being important in driving BS- specific gene expression 
(29, 53, 54). In total, we identified three BS- specific motifs, and 
four MS- specific de novo motifs that are shared between the species

sampled (Fig. 6 A and B and SI Appendix, Fig. S32). Using motif 
comparison tools, we were able to assign five out of the six motifs 
to a putative TF family, implicating potential novel regulators in 
BS- and MS- specific gene expression (SI  Appendix, Supplemental 
Methods and Fig. S29). We surveyed the C4 ACRs for the presence 
and absence of these motifs to determine whether they provide the 
information needed for cell- type specificity. We additionally overlaid 
our BLAST results from the previous analysis in order to explore 
the relationship between these motifs and conservation (Fig. 6C). A 
substantial number of motifs were present within the nonconserved 
regions of the ACRs. For instance, in one MS- specific ACR associated 
with ZmCA3,12/13 MS- specific motifs were found in nonconserved 
regions, suggesting these regions could be critical for driving the cell- 
type- specificity of this locus (Fig. 6D).
 We expanded the analysis of BS- and MS-specific motifs in 
conserved and nonconserved regions of ACRs across key loci in 
the C4  species. On average the MS-specific motifs are more con­
served than the BS-specific motifs ( Fig. 6 E  and F   and SI Appendix, 
Fig. S33 A  ). Agreeing with previous models of C4  evolution where 
some motifs that are MS specific have been co-opted to operate 
in C4  photosynthesis ( Fig. 6D  ) ( 11 ). Interestingly, we noticed a 
pattern where around PPDK , many of the MS-specific motifs 
appeared to be in nonconserved sequences for all of our species 
sampled (SI Appendix, Fig. S33 A  and B ). This pattern is further 
highlighted in both NADPME , and NADME  loci, where a major­
ity of the BS-specific motifs occurred in nonconserved ACRs for 
 NADPME . This pattern is more nuanced in the NADME  ACRs, 
as P . miliaceum  and U. fusca  share a significant amount of con­
served sequence containing BS-specific motifs in the ACRs, sug­
gesting that the BS-specific regulatory changes associated with 
these motifs are important (SI Appendix, Fig. S33A  ). These results 
highlight the capacity of genome-wide single-cell cis -regulatory 
maps to pinpoint key TF motifs important for the evolution of 
cell-type specificity.  
The DITs in the NADP - ME Subtypes Demonstrate Dynamic CRE 
Evolution. Upon analyzing the malate transporters DICARBOXYLIC 
ACID TRANSPORTERs (DITs also known as the DCTs), we noticed 
the DITs in the NADP- ME subtypes showed an interesting pattern 
where the copies of DIT1 in Z. mays and S. bicolor showed MS- 
specific chromatin accessibility, but the BS- specific copies of the 
DITs showed a more complex evolutionary history (Fig.  3B and 
SI Appendix, Fig. S34). We generated a phylogeny with additional 
species and found that the BS- specific copy of ZmDIT2 is related to 
two additional copies of DITs which are not BS- specific in S. bicolor 
(Here SbDIT2.2 and SbDIT2.1) (SI Appendix, Fig. S34). S. bicolor has 
a BS- specific copy of SbDIT4, which shares a clade with ZmDIT1. 
These results are consistent with earlier studies that found similar 
patterns and gene expression profiles of these copies of the DITs in 
Z. mays and S. bicolor (33, 36, 55). Although previous studies have 
documented changes in cell- type- specific gene expression for the 
BS- specific copies of the DITs, the mechanisms underlying these 
changes remain unclear. By using cell- type- specific ACRs, we explored 
whether expression changes are associated with changes in the number 
of cell- type- specific cis- regulatory elements over evolutionary time.
 T o understand how cell-type specificity changed in these DITs due 
to changes in cis -regulation, we compared the ACRs associated with 
the DITs , and mapped the TF-binding motifs found within each 
ACR (Methods ). For the MS- specific DIT1s , we focused on a 
MS-specific ACR located at the 3′  end of DIT1  in Z. mays  
(SI Appendix, Fig. S34 ). Upon comparing this ACR to S. bicolor , we 
were struck that the sequence found in the Z. mays  ACR was actually 
split in two in S. bicolor , neither of which demonstrated cell-type 
specificity in S. bicolor  (SI Appendix, Fig. S34 ). A closer inspection of 
motifs in these ACRs showed many MS-specific motifs (SI Appendix, 
Fig. S34 ). These motifs might promote MS-specific gene expression 
of this locus. However, many S. bicolor  MS-specific ACRs were not 
found in regions with any homology to Z. mays  ( SI Appendix, 
Fig. S34 ). These results point to the rapid change of candidate CREs 
(cCRES) in this locus, and likely indicate that cCREs important in 
cell-type-specific gene expression might not be only found in con­
served regulatory regions ( 56 ). Rather, selection of MS-specific gene 
expression is ongoing and may yield significantly different regulatory 
environments in relatively short evolutionary time scales.
 Next, we examined the BS-specific ZmDIT2  and its two ort­
hologs SbDIT2.1 and SbDIT2.2 , which are not BS specific 
(SI Appendix, Fig. S35 ). The BS-specific ACR around ZmDIT2  
has many DOF TF motifs (SI Appendix, Fig. S35 ). These motifs 
are interesting, as expression changes within the DOF TF family 
could be important in driving BS-specific gene expression in C 4  
plants ( 29 ,  53 ,  57 ). When comparing the BS-specific ACRs 
around ZmDIT4  to the more closely related copies of SbDIT2.1  
and SbDIT2.2,  we found no conservation of these DOF TF 
motifs, and rather a significant lack of BS-specific TF motifs 
(SI Appendix, Fig. S355 ). Since neither of these DIT  copies in S. 
bicolor  show BS-specific expression, this result makes sense. 
Potentially providing a model where the ZmDIT2  locus either 
gained these cCREs allowing for this copy of ZmDIT2  to have 
BS-specific gene expression, or S. bicolor  lost these BS-specific

it demonstrates the rapid pace of CRE evolution, and how these 
regions might be altering cell-type-specific gene expression. These 
results contrast with SbDIT4 , where the ACRs around this locus 
are BS specific, and contain BS-specific motifs identified in our 
previous analysis (SI Appendix, Fig. S35 ). In total, these results 
highlight the rapid rate of regulatory change around key C4  loci, 
and highlight the fact that there are likely key regulatory switches 
outside of conserved sequences. Finally, these results emphasize 
the fast pace in which cell-type specificity changes in plants   
Discussion
 Understanding the evolution of cis -regulation associated with C4  
photosynthesis has been a long-standing goal in the field of plant 
biology. In this study, we demonstrated the utility of single- cell 
ATAC-seq data to investigate many aspects of the evolution of C4  
photosynthesis. By identifying cell-type-specific chromatin accessi­
bility from four C4  species composed of three different C4  subtypes, 
as well as a single C3  outgroup, we were able to compare key genes 
and their ACRs which define and distinguish C4  photosynthesis. We 
have shown that by using gene-body chromatin accessibility data, we 
can measure cell-type-specific bias of both core, and subtype-specific 
C4  enzymes. When considering the gene family trees of many of these 
genes, we show diverse co- option of loci into the C 4  pathway. 
Additionally, we identify cell-type-specific ACRs surrounding these 
key C4  enzymes. We find numerous cell-type-specific ACRs sur­
rounding key C4  enzymes, many of which fall outside of the core 
promoter region. Additionally we find that around all of the C 4  
enzymes there is a mix of both conserved and novel cell-type-specific 
ACRs indicating that regulatory evolution of these regions is ongoing. 
Finally, we use cell-type-specific ACRs to identify a series of de novo 
binding motifs which appear to be cell-type specific, and show that 
these motifs surround C4  loci, and have a mixed relationship with 
conservation depending on the motif. This indicates that cell-type-
specific TF motifs are rapidly changing around C4  loci.
 Investigation of the CREs driving cell-type-specific expression of 
C4  genes is challenging. This often requires evaluation using transgenic 
plants, which limits the number of CREs that can be tested. This has 
greatly hampered efforts at understanding how cis -regulation of C4  
genes evolves, whether by co-option of existing CREs or emergence 
of new ones. Our results show the complex nature of CRE evolution 
of C4  genes, including those specific to C4  subtypes. While we observe 
conservation of ACRs around many C4  genes, we do see interesting 
examples where the subtype-specific enzymes have evolved novel 
ACRs (NAD-ME s in P . miliaceum , and PEPCK  in U. fusca ). These 
results support that there is likely a combination of both co-opting 
preexisting CREs, as well as evolving new ones to facilitate proper 
expression and cell-type-specification of genes. This is further exem­
plified by the analysis of the DIT  family of transporters, where we 
show striking accumulation of cell-type-specific TF motifs in non­
conserved regions of ACRs between two closely related species. This 
highlights that the regions of the genome promoting cell-type-specific 
gene expression are likely found in both conserved, and novel 
regions. Another recent single-cell genomic study of the evolution 
of CREs important for photosynthesis using a comparison between 
 O. sativa  and S. bicolor  reached similar conclusions ( 57 ). They fre­
quently found different ACRs and TF motifs in promoters of ort­
hologous C4  genes ( 57 ). Future efforts to assay these candidate CREs 
using reporter assays, transgenesis, and genome editing will be 
required. Additionally, expanding these analyses outward to all genes 
associated with photosynthesis might provide valuable insights into 
how genes in the Calvin-Benson cycle alter their regulation in their 
adaptation to C4  photosynthesis. Fortunately, these high-resolution 
maps of cell-type-specific ACRs of these key genes/species provide a 
strong foundation to build upon.
 Although these studies provide a blueprint for the study of key 
candidate CREs associated with C4  loci, profiling cell-type-specific 
chromatin accessibility of additional species would be greatly bene­
ficial. Although O. sativa  is an invaluable outgroup for this study, 
additional more closely related C3  species might make these com­
parisons simpler, and add additional resolution. For instance the C3  
grass species Dichanthelium oligosanthes  is more closely related to  
 U. fusca  and P . miliaceum  and has a recently completed reference 
genome ( 58 ). Adding more species would enable greater resolution 
in the comparison of cell-type-specific ACRs, as the genetic distance 
between the species we examined, and O. sativa  make identification 
of conserved and novel ACRs challenging. As an example, the ACRs 
associated with NAD-MEs  in P . miliaceum  might be co-opted instead 
of novel, however, based on our sampling, we cannot say.
 Genome editing analysis of many of these ACRs would signif­
icantly advance which ACRs, and more specifically which CREs 
within the ACRs are most important for cell-type-specific expres­
sion ( 22 ). However, currently generating genome edits in mono­
cots is challenging, time consuming, and expensive. Fortunately, 
improvements to transgenesis are constantly improving making 
achieving these goals more likely in the future ( 59 ). It is also 
important to consider that mutational analysis of CREs is not 
straightforward, often requiring numerous editing events of the 
 cis -regulatory landscape of each gene. Previous studies have shown 
that deletions of many CREs produce variable molecular and 
morphological phenotypes, further complicating our understand­
ing of the cis -regulatory code ( 60   – 62 ). And finally, many species, 
including P . miliaceum  and U. fusca  have to date never been trans­
formed. This highlights the need to continually improve trans­
genesis methods to help facilitate the molecular dissection of CRE. 
In conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive map of 
cell-type-specific ACRs around key C 4  genes, which reveals the 
dynamic evolution and diversity of cis -regulation of C4  genes.  
Methods
Plant Growth Conditions and Sampling. Seedlings of all five plant species, includ-
ing maize (Z. mays B73), sorghum (S. bicolor BTx623), proso millet (P . miliaceum L. 
CGRIS 00000390), and browntop signalgrass (U. fusca LBJWC- 52), along with the C3 
plant rice (O. sativa Nipponbare), were grown under the conditions of 12:12 Light/
Dark cycles at 30 °C Light/22 °C Dark and at 50% humidity. The sampling of the C4 
species was timed to coincide with a specific developmental stage, identified when 
the ligule of the third leaf became visible, marking the third leaf unfolding, yet prior 
to the appearance of the fourth leaf. For the C3 species, rice, 18- d- old leaves were used 
to correspond with the equivalent stage of the C4 species.
Library Preparation.  Nuclei isolation for the experiments was conducted 
using fresh seedlings of both the C 4 and C3 species at their respective develop-
mental stages. The methodology for nuclei extraction, encompassing the buffer 
composition and the subsequent steps, was used with procedures outlined for 
single- nucleus combinatorial indexing with transposed- based ATAC- seq library 
construction, as detailed in a prior study (63).
Barcode Correction Read Alignment and Mapping of Tn5 Insertions. Read 
UMIs were processed using cutadapt (version 4.5) to identify UMIs (64). First, the 
index adapter sequences were trimmed from the reads. Next, the well barcodes and 
Tn5 barcode within the reads were identified, removed from the original sequencing 
read, and appended to the read header. Reads were aligned using BWA (version 
0.7.17) (65). Reads were filtered using samtools (version 1.16.1) for mapping quality 
of >10 for Z. mays, S. bicolor, U. fusca, and O. sativa. P . miliaceum required a greater 
threshold of 30 given its recent whole genome duplication (66). Duplicate reads were 
removed using picard tools (version 2.25.0) (67). Single- base pair Tn5 integration 
events were mapped using the python script makeTn5bed.py. Finally, for each bar-
code only unique Tn5 integrations sites were used.

Isolating High- Quality Cells.  Cells were filtered using Socrates (21). In 
short, Fraction of Reads in Peaks (FRiP) scores were calculated for each cell by 
pseudobulking the libraries and identifying peaks. For each individual cell, 
FRiP score, TSS, enrichment, as well as correlation to background were used 
to isolate high- quality cells. Additional details can be found in SI Appendix, 
Supplemental Methods.
UMAP embeddings were then calculated for each species utilizing genomic 
bins (68). Additional bin selection criteria and clustering specifics can be found 
in SI Appendix, Supplemental Methods. Doublets were then removed using 
the in silico approach Scrublet (69) (SI  Appendix, Supplemental Methods). 
Harmony (version 0.1.1) was used adjust replicate overlap with parameters 
“theta = 2, nclust = 4, and var = sampleID” (70). After integration, clusters 
which skewed greater than 75% toward one replicate were removed from 
downstream analysis.
Annotation of Cell Types. Cell types were annotated by calculating gene chroma-
tin accessibility for marker genes in each genome on a per- cell basis. These values 
were then visualized on the UMAP embedding, and clusters with numerous marker 
genes associated with the same cell- type were used as evidence. Additionally, for 
each louvain cluster, enrichment of marker genes was calculated by comparing the 
cluster average as compared to a random shuffle of random cells. The top five most 
enriched markers were used in tandem with the UMAPs to ascertain cell- type identity. 
We also tested the statistical significance of the marker gene using Presto, a modified 
Wilcoxon rank- sum test in order to identify the most unique marker gene in each 
cluster (71). Additional methods implemented to ensure comparison of the same 
cell types can be found in Supplemental methods.
Identifying Cell- Type- Specific ACRs. To identify cell- type specific ACRs, a modified 
bootstrapping method was used which drew inspiration from the modified entropy 
metrics found in ref. 72. On a per ACR basis, Tn5 integrations per cell- type were 
summed and counts per million (CPM) normalized. These values were then converted 
to a probability by using the following equation (below, Eq. 1). From this probability 
statement, a modified Shannon entropy metric was calculated, followed by a metric 
of specificity Qpt. For robust cell- type- specific ACR identification, the annotated cell- 
type was bootstrapped 5,000 times. To generate the null distribution of specificity 
scores, individual cell annotations were scrambled to generate an equal number of 
null cell- type classifications. For each null value, the entropy and specificity score 
were calculated. Finally, a nonparametric approach was used to identify how many 
of the real bootstraps fell outside of the null distribution using a one- tailed test. ACRs 
specific to greater than three were classified as broadly accessible, less than or equal 
to three as cell type restricted, and a single cell- type as cell- type specific. Additional 
details can be found in Supplemental methods.
