multi-enzyme single-cell catalyst for the 
asymmetric amination of ketoacids and ketones

Abstract 
Background: Transaminases have become a key tool in biocatalysis to introduce the amine functionality into a range 
of molecules like prochiral α-ketoacids and ketones. However, due to the necessity of shifting the equilibrium towards 
the product side (depending on the amine donor) an efficient amination system may require three enzymes. So far, 
this well-established transformation has mainly been performed in vitro by assembling all biocatalysts individually, 
which comes along with elaborate and costly preparation steps. We present the design and characterization of a 
flexible approach enabling a quick set-up of single-cell biocatalysts producing the desired enzymes. By choosing an 
appropriate co-expression strategy, a modular system was obtained, allowing for flexible plug-and-play combination 
of enzymes chosen from the toolbox of available transaminases and/or recycling enzymes tailored for the desired 
application.
Results: By using a two-plasmid strategy for the recycling enzyme and the transaminase together with chromo-
somal integration of an amino acid dehydrogenase, two enzyme modules could individually be selected and com-
bined with specifically tailored E. coli strains. Various plug-and-play combinations of the enzymes led to the construc-
tion of a series of single-cell catalysts suitable for the amination of various types of substrates. On the one hand the 
fermentative amination of α-ketoacids coupled both with metabolic and non-metabolic cofactor regeneration was 
studied, giving access to the corresponding α-amino acids in up to 96% conversion. On the other hand, biocatalysts 
were employed in a non-metabolic, “in vitro-type” asymmetric reductive amination of the prochiral ketone 4-phenyl-
2-butanone, yielding the amine in good conversion (77%) and excellent stereoselectivity (ee = 98%).
Conclusions: The described modularized concept enables the construction of tailored single-cell catalysts which 
provide all required enzymes for asymmetric reductive amination in a flexible fashion, representing a more efficient 
approach for the production of chiral amines and amino acids.

Background
Enantiopure α-amino acids [1, 2] and amines [3, 4] repre-
sent classes of chiral chemicals with versatile application 
in chiral pharmaceutical and asymmetric synthesis. Bio -
catalysis [ 5] has contributed remarkably to the develop -
ment of economically feasible and sustainable methods 
for the preparation of these compounds: examples of 
enzymes comprise imine reductases [ 6–8], monoamine 
oxidases [ 9, 10], amine dehydrogenases [ 11–14], hydro -
lytic enzymes [ 15, 16] or transaminases (TAs) [ 17–19] 
for asymmetric functionalization of keto groups. The 
latter are pyridoxal-phosphate dependent enzymes cata -

amine to a keto group to produce a chiral amine with a 
new stereocenter and thus a molecule with increased 
value. An efficient TA-catalyzed amination depends on 
the removal or recycling of the co-product to shift the 
reaction equilibrium towards the product side. A range 
of well-working techniques has been developed like the 
coupling of l-alanine dependent TAs with an alanine 
dehydrogenase (AlaDH) and an enzyme for nicotinamide 
cofactor regeneration, which can be for instance formate 
dehydrogenase or glucose dehydrogenase [20, 21]. This 
orthogonal three-enzyme cascade has successfully dem
-
onstrated its usefulness in a range of TA-catalyzed trans -
formations and hence has occupied a permanent spot 
in cell-free biocatalysis involving TAs. Nevertheless, the 
assembly of multiple biocatalysts in  vitro, which is gen
-
erally termed “systems biocatalysis” [22–24], implies the 
individual production of each required enzyme, which is 
time-consuming and lacks elegance. Consequently, con
-
siderable effort has been dedicated to the development 
of microbial cell factories, which are designed to perform 
multistep biotransformations in  vivo. However, instead 
of exploiting native or engineered metabolic pathways 
[25, 26], focus has lately been put on the introduction of 
whole artificial de novo pathways [27–30]. This approach 
leads to tailored single-cell biocatalysts, which excel 
related cell-free systems by offering a more inexpensive 
and easy catalyst preparation and a simplified overall pro
-
cess configuration. Required cofactors can be provided 
and/or regenerated by the cell using an internal cofactor 
recycling system coupled to the host’s metabolism. Fur
-
thermore, the close proximity of biocatalysts within the 
confined space of one cell enables consecutive or even 
concurrent reaction steps in a highly efficient way [31]. 
Such in  vivo cascades have been successfully developed 
for a variety of useful applications and are highlighted as 
well as opposed to in vitro approaches in several recent 
in-depth reviews [32–35]. While at the beginning mostly 
redox reactions including dehydrogenases, reductases 
and monooxygenases were considered for tailor-made 
designer cells [36–39], recently also TA-catalyzed reduc
-
tive amination attracted attention to being included in 
artificial in  vivo pathway construction [40, 41]. In this 
context especially the amino functionalization of alcohols 
by combining an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) with a 
TA in a redox self-sufficient fashion has been extensively 
studied [42, 43]. Moreover, transamination was investi
-
gated with recombinant yeast single-cells of Saccharo -
myces cerevisiae, exploiting cell metabolism for cofactor 
regeneration [44, 45]. To our knowledge however, there 
are no reports on transferring the classic TA-catalyzed 
reductive amination machinery into a single recombinant 
E. coli cell. Therefore, in the present study the orthogo
-
nal cascade was translated from an in vitro to an in vivo 
mediated approach by generating all required enzymes 
within a bacterial single-cell system. In order to allow for 
a flexible interplay of multiple enzyme-catalyzed reac
-
tions within one cell, thorough catalyst design as well as 
a careful choice of co-expression strategy were crucial 
parameters. The microbial cell factory contained three 
basic enzyme modules, each of them catalyzing one of 
the reactions constituting the targeted orthogonal cas

cade: (1) asymmetric reductive amination, (2) amine 
donor regeneration and (3) nicotinamide cofactor regen

eration. Each module offered various enzyme options, 
which were combined in a plug-and-play fashion for vari
-
ous demands, enabling broad applicability. The obtained 
toolbox of single-cell biocatalysts was successfully 
employed for the asymmetric reductive amination of 
α-ketoacids and prochiral ketones, investigating both fer

mentative transformations coupled to the host’s metabo -
lism and non-metabolic “in vitro-type” transformations.

Design and construction of modular plug‑and‑play 
single‑cell biocatalysts
The aim was the development of a recombinant E. coli 
single-cell system providing all required enzymes for the 
asymmetric reductive amination of prochiral α-ketoacids 
and ketones in a flexible plug-and-play fashion. The sys
-
tem consisted of three modules, each of them represent -
ing one essential reaction type of the amination system, 
namely (i) the amination of the target substrate (module 
I), (ii) the recycling of the amine donor molecule (mod
-
ule II) and (iii) the recycling of the reduced nicotinamide 
cofactor (module III) (Fig.  1). For each module a library 
of different constructs encoding specific enzymes was 
available. Upon combination of selected compatible 
constructs from each module a single bacterial cell was 
generated, capable of catalyzing the targeted orthogo
-
nal cascade reaction. For module I in our representative 
study one out of four alternative constructs encoding 
enzymes for the reductive amination of keto-functional
-
ities can be chosen: a l-alanine–valine aminotransferase 
(encoded by avtA), a branched-chain amino acid ami
-
notransferase either from E. coli MG1655 (encoded by 
ilvEEc) or Streptococcus mutans (encoded by ilvE Sm) for 
the production of various α-amino acids or a (S)-selective 
transaminase from Chromobacterium violaceum [46] 
(encoded by ta
Cv), giving access to a broad range of opti -
cally pure amines. The required enzymes for regenerat -
ing the consumed amine donor are supplied by module 
II. While AvtA and  Ta
Cv rely on l-alanine as amine donor, 
IlvE is consuming l-glutamate. Consequently, an l-ala -
nine dehydrogenase (AlaDH) and a l-glutamate dehydro-
genase (GluDH) from Bacillus subtilis were determined 
as the enzymes of module II. The third module finally

Farnberger et al. Microb Cell Fact  (2017) 16:132 
provided various options for regenerating the nicotina -
mide cofactor NADH required for the oxidation reaction 
catalyzed by AlaDH and GluDH. NADH can either be 
regenerated in the traditional way by cellular metabolism, 
using a co-substrate like glucose, or by an enzyme-cou
-
pled approach. For the latter option, a toolbox was gen -
erated consisting of three constructs encoding either a 
formate dehydrogenase (FDH) from Komagataella pasto
-
ris GS115, a glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) from Bacillus 
megaterium and a phosphite dehydrogenase (PtDH) from 
Pseudomonas stutzeri. In order to enable a flexible cata
-
lyst design allowing for easy plug-and-play-like combina -
tion of desired enzymes, the corresponding genes had to 
be controlled separately from each other within one cell. 
Therefore, co-expression of the enzymes required for 
modules I–III was set-up by combining a two-plasmid 
strategy with the integration of one gene into the chro
-
mosome of the used E. coli host (Fig.  2). Genes encoding 
transaminases were individually cloned into the IPTG-
inducible E. coli expression vector pTrc99A (plasmid 1) 
under the control of the Ptrc promoter and ribosome 
binding sites upstream of each gene (pTrc99A-avtA, 
pTrc99A-ilvE, pTrc99A-ta
Cv). Genes coding for AlaDH 
and GluDH were individually integrated into the genome 
of the used E. coli strain by homologous recombination 
resulting in two hosts. For this purpose, the araBAD  
genes in the chromosome of E. coli W3110 were replaced 
with heterologous ald (AlaDH) or rocG (GluDH) gene, 
respectively under the control of IPTG-inducible strong 
Ptrc promoter [47] and ribosome binding sites upstream 
of each gene. The new strains were named Ec-AlaDH (E. 
coli W3110ΔaraBAD::Ptrc-ald ) and Ec-GluDH (E. coli 
W3110ΔaraBAD::Ptrc-rocG) according to the amino

enzymes catalyzing reductive amination of the target substrate, module II offers two enzymatic options for amine donor regeneration and finally, 
nicotinamide cofactor recycling is performed by components of module III. The flexible nature of the approach allows for easy substitution of indi-
vidual enzymes according to the wanted application

acid dehydrogenase they provided. The genes encoding 
NADH-recycling enzymes were cloned into pBAD28 
(plasmid 2) under control of the arabinose-inducible 
the PBAD  promoter [48] and ribosome binding sites 
upstream of each gene. Due to a different origin of rep
-
lication (p15Aori) and a chloramphenicol resistance, 
pBAD28 provides the appropriate features to be com
-
patible with pTrc99A (pBR322ori, bla). However, since 
it also contains the same β-lactamase gene, we removed 
parts of it in order to inactivate the ampicillin resist
-
ance (pBAD28∆bla). The newly obtained plasmids 
were designated pBAD28∆bla-fdh , pBAD28∆bla-gdh , 
pBAD28∆bla-ptdh.
By co-transformation of the specific recombinant 
strains with the required compatible plasmid(s), the dif
-
ferent enzyme modules were assembled flexibly within 
one cell and gave rise to a range of single-cell catalysts use
-
ful for various applications (Table 1). Due to the fact that 
transaminase IlvE depends on l-glutamate as amine donor, 
plasmid pTrc99A-ilvE was transformed into strain Ec-
GluDH. In a first approach the NADH recycling depended 
on cell catabolism (Table 1, catalyst 1a and b ). The other 
transaminases AvtA and  Ta
Cv rely on l -alanine as amino 
donor and were thus transformed into strain Ec-AlaDH.
While AvtA was coupled both with glucose catabo -
lism (catalyst 2) as well as with a regenerating enzyme for 
nicotinamide recycling (catalysts 3–5), the (S)-selective 
transaminase  Ta
Cv was just used in combination with the 
enzyme-coupled approach (catalysts 6–8). With the con -
structed single-cell biocatalysts in hand, optimization of 
co-expression of multiple enzymes within one cell was 
required. In order to validate the production of active 
proteins and an ideal ratio of enzyme activities, we per
-
formed photometric activity assays individually for each 
enzyme, ensuring that all the genes were functionally 
expressed. Depending on the expression conditions used, 
crude extracts displayed specific enzyme activities of 
approximately 0.1–0.3 U mg
−1 for transaminase  TaCv and 
IlvE, whereas a significantly higher transaminase activity 
of 0.7–1  U  mg
−1 was obtained for AvtA. While GluDH 
expressed from genome-encoded rocG indicated a spe -
cific activity of 0.4  U  mg −1, for AlaDH expressed from 
the genome-encoded ald  widely differing specific activi -
ties in the range of 0.12–0.36 U  mg−1 were obtained. In 
order to increase the amount of AlaDH present in the 
cell and consequently also its activity, a second ald  gene 
copy was introduced to the system via plasmid pTrc99A-
avtA-ald, which has already been constructed previously 
[49]. Additionally, another vector with a different gene 
order was constructed in this study, where AlaDH was 
encoded in the first position of the artificial operon with 
the Ptrc promoter upstream of ald  (pTrc99A-ald-avtA). 
Indeed, activity assays showed that AlaDH activity was 
enhanced manifold to 2.1  U  mg
−1 with the latter plas -
mid. In comparison, crude extracts of the strain DH5α 
carrying pTrc99A-avtA-ald displayed only 0.3  U  mg
−1. 
This result showed that not only the increased number 
of plasmid-encoded ald genes, but especially the distance 
between promoter and gene in the operon significantly 
affected expression efficiency (operon polarity). Never
-
theless, both plasmid-based gene orders of the artificial 
avtA-ald and ald -avtA operons, respectively were used 
for further experiments and compared to the genome-
based approach. With respect to the third module for 
nicotinamide regeneration all the required enzymes 
were functionally expressed, with FDH offering a specific 
activity of approximately 0.2 and 0.6  U  mg
−1 for PtDH. 
Concerning GDH, values ranged from 1.7 to 11.9 U mg−1

depending on the expression conditions used. However, 
GDH turned out to be the most active enzyme in terms 
of cofactor regeneration.
Influence and toxicity of used substrates on the viability 
of E. coli W3110
Substrates used in single-cell biotransformations as well 
as the corresponding obtained products might have toxic 
effects on the living host cell and thus limit the efficiency 
and turnover of the biocatalyst. The potential toxicity of 
several α-keto acids which are common substrates for 
transaminases AvtA and IlvE has already been assessed in 
previous work [49]. Since in the present study the single-
cell catalyzed transamination reaction has been further 
investigated with an enzyme-coupled approach for cofac
-
tor regeneration, some more substrates had to be tested. 
For instance, PtDH from Pseudomonas stuzeri accepts 
phosphite or hypophosphite as substrate for the regen
-
eration of NADH, whereas FDH from Komagataella 
pastoris requires formate. Therefore, sodium hypophos
-
phite monohydrate, sodium phosphite dibasic pentahy -
drate, sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate and 
sodium formate were added in varying concentrations 
to W3110 SGA minimal medium cultures at inoculation 
and growth was followed by  Biolector
® cultivation sys -
tem. Both phosphite substrates as well as phosphates had 
low inhibitory effects on E. coli W3110 cells in a similar 
range (Fig. 3). Even more than a half of maximum growth 
rate (µ) was observed at a concentration of 100  mM 
phosphite, hypophosphite or phosphate, respectively. In 
contrast, toxic effects based on addition of formate were 
more significant as the cell growth was reduced drasti
-
cally by the presence of only 20 mM formate. Hence, the 
application of PtDH together with phosphite might be a 
promising way for regenerating consumed cofactors in 
single-cell catalyzed amination reactions.
Fermentative amination of α‑ketoacids
The successful assembly and co-expression of either 
transaminase AvtA or IlvE of module I with AlaDH 
or GluDH, respectively from module II gave rise to 
single-cell biocatalysts for one-pot transformations of 
α-ketoacids to α-amino acids in a fermentative fashion. 
In the first part of the study, cofactor regeneration was 
performed via the cell metabolism-coupled approach, 
using glucose as carbon source. As a second strategy, the 
enzyme-coupled strategy for cofactor regeneration was 
investigated and compared with previous results.
Fermentative amination of α‑ketoacids with metabolic NADH 
regeneration
The first biocatalyst to reductively aminate α-ketoacids 
combined an endogenous (catalyst 1a) or a heterologous 
l-glutamate dependent transaminase IlvE from Strepto -
coccus mutans (catalyst 1b), respectively with NAD(P)
H-dependent l-glutamate dehydrogenase (GluDH) from 
B. subtilis. Using l-glutamate as amine donor, IlvE trans
-
forms several 2-ketoacids to the corresponding amino 
acids, among them being the three branched-chain 
2-keto-isocaproate (KIC), 2-keto-isovalerate (KIV) and 
2-keto-3-methylvalerate (KMV), which are converted to 
l-leucine, l-valine and to l-isoleucine, respectively. Since 
preliminary studies (data not shown) revealed that the 
enzyme has its highest affinity for KIC, the biotransfor
-
mation of KIC to l-leucine catalyzed by newly assembled 
E. coli single-cell catalysts 1a (Ec-GluDH/pTrc99A-ilvE
Ec) 
and 1b (Ec-GluDH/pTrc99A-ilvE Sm) was investigated 
with and without the addition of amine donor (Fig.  4a). 
As a negative control Ec-GluDH strain transformed with 
empty pTrc99A vector was used. The cofactor NADH 
was regenerated by oxidative catabolism of the employed 
carbon source glucose. Fermentative biotransformations 
were performed with 50  mM KIC and l-leucine forma
-
tion was monitored over a time period of 66 h. While cat-
alyst 1a showed only a low conversion of 16% after 43 h, 
catalyst 1b with IlvE from Streptococcus mutans con -
verted twice as much (32%) KIC to l-leucine within the 
same time. Remarkably, the negative control Ec-GluDH/
pTrc99A without overexpressed transaminase showed 
14% turnover after 43  h as well. However, addition of 
250  mM  l-glutamate improved the conversion of all 
strains overexpressing a transaminase to 90–92%, while 
36% conversion was obtained for the control strain after 
Fig. 3 Toxicity study. Growth of E. coli W3110 in SGA medium sup-
plemented with varying concentrations of sodium hypophosphite 
monohydrate (black circle), sodium phosphite dibasic pentahydrate 
(white circle), sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate (Black 
inverted triangle) and sodium formate (white triangle). The maximum 
growth rate (μ) is plotted against the concentration of substrates and 
products

43 h. Therefore, the presence of additional amine donor 
seems to play a key role under present reaction condi -
tions, which might be explained by a too low expression 
level of GluDH and thus an insufficient regeneration of 
consumed l-glutamate.
The second single-cell biocatalyst for the fermentative 
production of amino acids relied on endogenous l-ala
-
nine dependent transaminase C (AvtA) co-expressed 
with NADH-dependent l-alanine dehydrogenase 
(AlaDH) from B. subtilis. These enzymes have already 
been investigated successfully for the single-cell cata
-
lyzed reductive amination of KMV to l-isoleucine using 
a two-plasmid based approach before [49]. In the present 
work, however, the concept was extended to a more flex
-
ible set-up with the ald  gene being integrated into the 
host genome. Furthermore, the contribution of another 
ald gene copy being plasmid-encoded together with avtA 
as well as the effect of its cloning position was studied. It 
was assumed that the expression level of AlaDH played 
an important role in the turnover of the substrate. Bio
-
transformations were again performed with 50  mM 
KMV in a fermentative way making use of the bacterial 
glucose catabolism for NADH recycling and the forma
-
tion of l-isoleucine was monitored over 43  h (Fig.  4b). 
Employing catalyst 2a (Ec-AlaDH/pTrc99A-avtA) for the 
fermentation, which offers only one genome-integrated 
copy of ald, moderate 68% of KMV were converted to 
l-isoleucine. However, when additional plasmid-born 
AlaDH was provided, conversion increased to 84% within 
20  h using catalyst 2b (Ec-AlaDH/pTrc99A-avtA-ald ) 
and even 96% of product were formed with the help of 
catalyst 2c (Ec-AlaDH/pTrc99A-ald-avtA) where a dif
-
ferent gene order has been used. This strongly indicated 
that high expression of ald  gene promoted the turnover 
of KMV to l-isoleucine, which coincided with the results 
obtained for catalyst 1. The negative control Ec-AlaDH/
pTrc99A did not produce any l-isoleucine. Due to the 
higher efficiency of the latter enzyme combination for 
reductive amination of α-ketoacids to α-amino acids, the 
single-cell catalyst composed of AvtA and AlaDH was 
chosen to be further investigated with the enzyme-cou
-
pled approach for cofactor regeneration based on GDH, 
FDH or PtDH.
Fermentative reductive amination of α‑ketoacids 
with non‑metabolic NADH regeneration
The tailor-made single-cell catalyst for reductive ami -
nation of KMV to l-isoleucine composed of AvtA and 
AlaDH was studied in more detail, using an enzyme-cou -
pled approach for NADH cofactor regeneration instead 
of cellular oxidation of glucose. The gene for the required 
enzyme catalyzing the reoxidation of  NAD
+ to NADH 
was provided by module III and expressed using plasmid 
pBAD28∆bla, thus, it could be chosen independently 
from the other two enzymes. Three different strategies 
for cofactor regeneration were investigated: oxidation 
of formate to carbon dioxide by  NAD
+-dependent for -
mate dehydrogenase (FDH), oxidation of glucose to β-d-
glucono-1,5-lactone by glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) 
from Bacillus megaterium and oxidation of phosphite to 
phosphate by  NAD
+-dependent phosphite dehydroge -
nase (PtDH) from Pseudomonas stutzeri, respectively.
The reductive aminations were performed in a fermen -
tative fashion (Fig.  5, Table  2), employing 50  mM KMV 
and 100  mM co-substrate. On the one hand, the three-
enzyme-system was studied with the ald  gene being

pTrc99A-avta-ald or pTrc99A-ald-avtA). SGA medium was inoculated 
aerobically with recombinant strains for the reductive amination of 
50 mM KIC or KMV to 
l-leucine and l-isoleucine, respectively. 100 mM 
glucose, 50 mM  (NH4)2SO4 and 0 or 250 mM l-glutamate in case of 
catalyst 1a–b were added to shift the reaction equilibrium towards 
product side

localized in the genome and thus present as a single 
copy (catalysts 3a, 4a and 5a). In that case, the addition 
of high amounts of l-alanine (250  mM) was necessary. 
On the other hand, experiments were performed with 
another ald gene copy (catalysts 3b, 4b and 5b) intro

duced via plasmid pTrc99A-avtA. As already observed 
before, the ald  gene being positioned right behind the 
Ptrc promoter (pTrc99A-ald -avtA) led to enhanced 
expression and activity, which is why this gene order was 
again used for additional AlaDH supply. In this case, the 
l-alanine concentration was reduced to 50–100  mM, 
as AlaDH expression and hence present amine donor 
amount was expected to be sufficient. For control reac

resulting in a fermentative amination which makes use of 
metabolic NADH regeneration and hence corresponds to 
catalysts 2a, 2b and 2c, respectively. Coupling the l-ala
-
nine dependent reductive amination catalyzed by AvtA 
with an enzyme catalyzed NADH regeneration system 
did not improve the overall conversion of KMV to l-iso
-
leucine in any case compared with the cellular regenera -
tion approach (control strains). No significant turnover 
at all was achieved neither with the FDH-coupled cata
-
lyst 3a (8% after 41  h), nor with the PtDH-coupled 5a 
(7% after 41  h). However, 44% conversion was achieved 
in the same reaction time with catalyst 4a, using GDH as 
recycling enzyme. This result coincided with the higher 
enzyme activities measured for GDH in contrast to the 
other recycling enzymes. Interestingly, comparable or 
even higher conversions were obtained in all three cases 
with corresponding control strains, indicating that the 
expression level of regeneration enzymes is not sufficient 
to outperform the cell-driven NADH recycling based on 
glucose (Table 2). 
Moreover, again the genome-based ald  expression was 
expected to be a limiting parameter for regeneration of 
consumed amine donor and thus for an efficient reduc
-
tive amination. Indeed, the addition of 250  mM  l-ala-
nine increased overall turnover significantly both for all 
single-cell catalysts as well as for control strains, lead
-
ing to 88–90% of product formation for catalyst 3a and 
5a and 73% for 4a. An additional cloning of ald  on the 
plasmid pTrc99A-ald-avtA did not increase the catalytic 
efficiency of the E. coli cells considerably. While a turno
-
ver of 13% and comparable 11.5% were achieved with 
catalyst 3b and its control strain after 42  h, catalyst 5b 
led even to reduced product formation (5%). The only 
exception turned out to be catalyst 4b making use of a 
GDH, where an additional ald gene copy seemed to be 
beneficial and increased turnover of KMV from 44 to 
80%. Nevertheless, comparable turnover was obtained 
with the control strain too. Once more, a remarkable 
enhancement was possible when additional amine donor 
(50  mM) was present in the fermentation broth, lead
-
ing to 88% product formation with catalyst 3b. Similarly, 
turnover of catalyst 4b could be slightly increased to 90%. 
However, still moderate conversions were achieved with 
catalyst 5b, even when 50 or 100  mM  l-alanine were 
added, resulting in 17 and 54% conversion, respectively.
“In vitro‑type” single‑cell catalyzed amination of prochiral 
ketones
Besides enabling the single-cell catalyzed reductive ami -
nation of α-ketoacids in a one-pot fermentation, the 
applicability of the modular plug-and-play concept was 
furthermore demonstrated for the synthesis of opti
-
cally pure amines. For this purpose, a transaminase 
from Chromobacterium violaceum  ( Ta
Cv) from module I 
offering a broader substrate spectrum was coupled with 
AlaDH from module II for regenerating the consumed 
amine donor l-alanine as well as with each of the three 
available enzymes from module III for NADH cofac
-
tor recycling, resulting in three single-cell catalysts 6–8 
(see Table  1). The asymmetric reductive amination of 
4-phenyl-2-butanone was chosen as model reaction 
and the overall performance of each single-cell biocata

lyst was compared by determining initial rates (Fig.  6) 
for the mentioned transformation. With respect to 
catalyst 6, co-expressing  Ta
Cv together with AlaDH and 
FDH, an apparent overall activity of 0.30  ±  0.02  U  g−1 
was obtained, whereas catalyst 7 involving a GDH for 
cofactor regeneration showed an apparent activity of 
0.22 ± 0.02 U g
−1. The best result, however, was obtained 
for catalyst 8, combining the transamination machinery 
with a PtDH and reaching thereby an apparent activity 
of 0.99 ± 0.07 U g
−1. Then the reactions were monitored 
over a time period of 48  h, employing and comparing

different catalyst preparations (Fig.  7). Besides the use of 
resting cells, the biocatalyst was applied in the form of 
lyophilized single-cells, cell-free extract and lyophilized 
cell-free extract. For sake of better comparability the 
amount of used lyophilized cells, lysate and lyophilized 
lysate always correlated to 50 mg of wet cells. Employing 
resting cells of catalyst 6 in the model reaction (Fig.  7a) 
led to formation of 35% of the desired amine, which was 
slightly increased to 45% with a twofold catalyst loading 
(100 mg mL
−1). Similar results were obtained with cata -
lyst 8, yielding already 33% of amine with half the cata -
lyst amount (20 mg mL −1), which could be increased to 
48–56% with one- to twofold of catalyst loading, respec -
tively (Fig. 7c). Less efficient in the reductive amination of 
4-phenyl-2-butanone seemed to be catalyst 7, converting 
only 25–32% of the ketone depending on the amount of 
used resting cells (50–100 mg mL
−1). However, with cat-
alyst 7 the occurrence of limitations during the reaction 
time became rather obvious (Fig.  7b), as within the first 
4 h the reaction rate was accelerated proportional to the 
amount of employed catalyst, but with proceeding reac
-
tion this correlation decreased significantly and almost 
no amine was formed anymore after 24 h. With respect 
to GDH-catalyzed cofactor regeneration, especially local 
acidification within the cell caused by the co-product glu

conic acid might be problematic, presumably leading to

enzyme inactivation. In general, applying the biocatalyst 
as lyophilized single-cells (corresponding to 50 mg of wet 
cells) significantly improved conversion levels in all cases, 
giving 52, 33 and 54% of amine with catalyst 6, catalyst 
7 and catalyst 8, respectively. Most likely, the cell mem
-
brane was permeabilized due to lyophilization in a way 
that led to better access of reaction components. Sur
-
prisingly, performing the biotransformation either with 
cell-free or lyophilized cell-free catalyst preparations, 
respectively did not show further beneficial effect on the 
outcome of the reaction. This was at least the case for 
catalyst 6 and 8. In contrast, the highest product forma
-
tion (37%) with catalyst 7 was achieved when employed 
as lyophilized cell-free extract. The inability of E. coli 
cells to import glucose without permeabilization of the 
cell membrane is a major drawback of GDH-catalyzed 
cofactor regeneration [50], which is why the complete 
removal of the cell wall might be improving the overall 
catalyst performance. In order to further increase the 
amine production by the recombinant E. coli single-cell 
catalyst, the effect of a higher catalyst loading using cata
-
lyst 6 in form of lyophilized cells was investigated. With 
a tenfold amount of catalyst, conversion to the amine 
could be increased by a factor of 1.5 to maximum 77% 
within 48  h. This indicated once more the occurrence 
of limitations over time such as enzyme inactivation or 
inhibition. As already observed during one-pot fermenta
-
tions of α-ketoacids before, also a too low activity level of 
AlaDH might lead to an inefficient reaction equilibrium 
and thus, to not quantitative conversions. Neverthe
-
less, the concept of assembling the reaction cascade for 
reductive amination of prochiral ketones in  vivo within 
one E. coli cell has been successfully proven, affording the 
(S)-amine in high yields with excellent to perfect optical 
purity (92–99%).
Discussion
“Tailor-made” single-cell biocatalysts co-expressing mul -
tiple enzymes enable efficient in  vivo reaction cascades 
[28, 32]. Consequently, the design and application of such 
microbial cell factories has attracted attention in recent 
years, aiming for the production of a broad range of valu
-
able chiral compounds. Since synthetic pathways com -
monly may involve cofactor-dependent redox reactions 
[51], various studies focused on the incorporation of reac
-
tion pathways in a host cell whereby the sequence itself 
enables a suitable cofactor regeneration resulting in redox 
self-sufficient single-cell catalysts [42, 52]. Alternatively, 
recycling of cofactors can be achieved by making use of 
the host’s inherent metabolic pathways, e.g. the catabo
-
lism of carbon sources like glucose [53]. In this study, 
we established a modular platform to construct E. coli 
single-cell biocatalysts tailored for the in vivo amination 
of ketoacids and prochiral ketones, exploiting both cell 
metabolism as well as additional enzyme-mediated strat
-
egies for cofactor regeneration. The fermentative trans -
formation of KMV to l-isoleucine showed that the use 
of an enzyme-coupled approach for NADH regeneration 
led to similar conversion as obtained with the metabo
-
lism-coupled one. This strongly suggests that the expres -
sion level of regenerating enzymes FDH, GDH and PtDH, 
respectively, was insufficient, lowering the overall cata
-
lytic performance. As a matter of fact, impaired enzyme 
production is a well-known obstacle of whole-cell bioca
-
talysis caused by an increased metabolic burden during 
cell growth due to the co-expression of multiple proteins 
within one cell [31]. In case of the amino acid dehydroge
-
nases GluDH and AlaDH a low expression level became 
apparent too, since extra addition of amine donors l-glu
-
tamate and l-alanine, respectively, to the fermentation 
broth significantly improved the transformation of both 
KIC and KMV to the corresponding α-amino acids. The 
role of l-alanine in such in vivo amination cascades has 
already been investigated before concerning the redox 
self-sufficient amination of alcohols [43]. Since l-alanine 
is not only required as amine donor for the desired reac
-
tion but also as energy source for the cell to maintain 
viability and the protein biosynthesis machinery under 
stress conditions, its addition in certain amounts is to be 
recommended, or even necessary. However, it was pos
-
sible to improve the amine donor regeneration system 
by including a second ald  gene copy additionally to the 
one being genome-integrated. This change on the genetic 
level led to higher amounts of expressed AlaDH and 
consequently to increased product formation, confirm
-
ing once more the assumption of reduced catalyst per -
formance due to impaired enzyme synthesis. However, 
not only the additional plasmid-born ald  gene but also 
its gene order contributed to enhanced protein expres
-
sion. This emphasized the crucial role of a thoroughly 
reasoned co-expression strategy in order to fine-tune 
expression levels and to achieve a functional microbial 
cell as catalytic unit. A vast synthetic biology toolbox is 
available for that purpose, offering different promoter 
systems, plasmid types and strategies to compose the 
ideal co-expression cassette [28, 54, 55].
In this study, a recombinant two-plasmid-based gene 
expression was combined with a genome-integrated 
one, ideally enabling control and induction of protein 
production independent from the host’s regulatory net
-
work. Furthermore, this modular system allowed for easy 
substitution of the individual enzymes according to the 
desired application of the single-cell catalyst. Exchang
-
ing for example the l-alanine–valine aminotransferase 
with the (S)-selective transaminase from Chromobac
-
terium violaceum facilitated a broader substrate range 
Page 11 of 17
Farnberger et al. Microb Cell Fact  (2017) 16:132 
and hence, a widened applicability of the approach. 
Thus, additionally to the amination of α-keto acids also 
the transformation of a prochiral ketone into an opti
-
cally active amine was achieved. The amination of 
4-phenyl-2-butanone was performed in a metabolism-
independent fashion, making use of enzyme-coupled 
regeneration of redox cofactors. In such “in vitro-type” 
reactions decoupled from the host’s metabolism param
-
eters like activity, stability and concentration of enzymes 
co-expressed within the single-cell biocatalyst play a par
-
ticularly important role [54]. Accordingly, limitations 
were observed during the amination of 4-phenyl-2-bu
-
tanone, which might be attributed again to an insufficient 
and imbalanced enzyme expression. Next to a generally 
low enzymatic activity of AlaDH and NADH recycling 
enzymes also a loss thereof over time caused by inactiva
-
tion or inhibition might be an issue. The adaption of the 
cellular metabolism of resting cells to the non-growth 
status results in a restricted self-regeneration and stress-
handling capacity, leading to a decrease of active enzyme 
amounts and as a consequence to an intracellular NADH 
shortage [56]. This might have been the reason why it 
was not possible to perform the “in vitro-type” reactions 
satisfyingly without the external addition of cofactors. 
Conversions were much higher when  NAD
+ was pre -
sent in the reaction mixture. According to literature the 
 NAD+ level of E. coli lies in the range of 5.3 nmol mg −1 
dry weight under standard growth conditions [57]. 
Thus, the application of whole-cell biocatalysts without 
additional coenzyme may be possible, but it has been 
reported before that by adding coenzymes the efficiency 
of the reaction is significantly enhanced [58]. Another 
crucial parameter in terms of non-fermentative transfor
-
mations turned out to be the permeabilization of the cell 
wall. Mass transfer limitations were overcome by lyophi
-
lization or even complete removal of cell wall via disrup -
tion and thus, higher conversions were obtained for the 
amination of 4-phenyl-2-butanone.
Conclusions
The developed concept of a plug-and-play E. coli single-
cell biocatalyst provides a library of enzymes for each of 
the different required reactions/modules of a reductive 
amination and suitable E. coli hosts, which can be com
-
bined depending on the desired target reaction. Conse -
quently, it represents a quite promising and cost-efficient 
alternative to the combination of isolated enzymes. Espe
-
cially, from an industrial point of view the described 
approach offers major advantages like the decrease of 
required fermentations and the reduction of costly and 
laborious isolation and purification steps. The flexible 
approach can be easily extended to other transaminases, 
allowing for a quick identification of the most suitable 
single-cell catalyst tailored for a specific substrate or a 
desired stereoselectivity. Depending on the required co-
substrate the appropriate amino acid dehydrogenase as 
well as NADH recycling system can be chosen. A further 
improvement of the modular platform would be the addi
-
tion of an alanine racemase, enabling the in  situ race -
mization of l-alanine to d-alanine and thus the efficient 
use of (R)-selective ω-TAs. In summary, the presented 
approach offers a platform to construct a broad range of 
single-cell catalysts in a flexible plug-and-play fashion 
for reductive amination. In comparison with the in vitro 
transamination system using individual biocatalysts from 
separate preparations, the single-cell approach enables 
easy production of the required enzymes and cost-effec
-
tive biotransformations.
Methods
Construction of bacterial strains and plasmids
Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are sum-
marized in Table 3. Plasmid pRed/ET  (tetR) was obtained 
from the “Quick and Easy E. coli Gene Deletion Kit” , 
Gene Bridges (Heidelberg, Germany) and plasmid pQE30 
was received from Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). Plasmid 
isolation was performed with the QIAprep spin miniprep 
kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). Standard DNA work like 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR), restriction and liga
-
tion were performed as described previously [59]. The 
oligonucleotides used in this study were obtained from 
Metabion GmbH (Martinsried, Germany) or Eurofins 
Genomics and are listed in Additional file 1: Table S1. For 
transformation  CaCl
2-competent E. coli cells [60] were 
heat-shocked for uptake of respective DNA. All cloned 
DNA fragments were shown to be correct by sequencing 
performed by LGC Genomics GmbH (Berlin, Germany).
Construction of expression plasmids
Plasmids were constructed with fragments generated by 
PCR (KOD Hot Start Polymerase kit, Novagen, Darm
-
stadt, Germany) using Bacillus subtilis as template for 
ald and rocG genes, E. coli MG1655 and Streptococ
-
cus mutans for ilvE genes, Chromobacterium violaceum 
for ta gene, Komagataella pastoris GS115 for fdh  gene, 
Bacillus megaterium for gdh  gene, Pseudomonas stuzeri 
for ptdh gene and E. coli W3110 for genes phnC, phnD, 
phnE. In this study two different cloning strategies based 
on the IPTG-inducible E. coli expression vector pTrc99A 
were used. In the first strategy the particular gene was 
inserted into the vector by using cut sites. In order 
to construct pTrc99A-ald -avtA, the oligonucleotides 
ald
Bs_RBS_fw/aldBs_rv were used and the PCR prod -
uct was ligated into the vector pTrc99A-avtA via EcoRI 
restriction site. The construction of pTrc99A-ilvE
Ec and 
pTrc99A-ilvESm was performed similarly with the primers 
Page 12 of 17Farnberger et al. Microb Cell Fact  (2017) 16:132 
ilvEEc_RBS_fw/ilvEEc_rv, ilvESm_RBS_fw/ilvESm_rv and 
EcoRI restriction site. For pTrc99A-ta Cv the PCR-ampli -
fied gene product using ta Cv_fw/taCv_rv was cut with 
EcoRI and Sal I and then ligated into pTrc99A digested 
with the same restriction enzymes. In the second strat -
egy the Gibson assembly method [63] was performed 
as a second cloning strategy to construct pTrc99A-ald -
avtA-ptdh. For this purpose the genes ald of Bacillus sub-
tilis, avtA of E. coli MG1655 and ptdh of Pseudomonas 
stuzeri were amplified with the oligonucleotides 
GA_ald_RBS_EcoRI_fw/GA_ald_rv, GA_avtA_RBS_fw/
GA_avtA_rv and GA_ptdh_RBS_fw/GA_ptdh_Xba I_rv, 
respectively and assembled with EcoRI/Xba I restricted 
pTrc99A using Gibson assembly method [63].
For expression of the genes encoding NAD(P)H-regen
-
erating enyzmes the arabinose-inducible pBAD28 plas -
mid was used. For deletion of the bla gene, the plasmid 
was digested with the restriction enzymes Alw44I 
and NsbI, treated with Klenow fragment and ligated. 
Subsequently, the obtained plasmid pBAD28∆bla 
was used for generating plasmids pBAD28∆bla-fdh  
(fdh_RBS_fw/fdh_rv), pBAD28∆bla-gdh  (gdh _RBS_
fw/gdh_rv) and pBAD28∆bla-ptdh (ptdh_RBS_fw/ptdh_
rv). Before ligation, the pBAD28∆bla vector as well as the 
PCR-derived gene products were treated with SacI and 
XbaI enzymes.
Construction of bacterial strains harbouring amino acid 
dehydrogenase genes
The open-reading coding region of the genes araBAD  
from E. coli W3110 genome were replaced with the gene 
ald or rocG under control of IPTG-inducible Ptrc pro -
moter and a kanamycin cassette flanked by FLP recogni -
tion target sites by using modified one-step method for 
inactivation of genes [62]. For the construction of recom-
bination plasmids, again the Gibson assembly method 
was applied. Linear DNA-fragments comprising FLP-
kan-FLP cassette and Ptrc promoter as well as ald or rocG 
gene, respectively were obtained by PCR using primers 
GA_kan_EcoRI_fw/GA_kan_rv, GA_trc_fw/GA_trc_rv, 
GA_ald_RBS_fw/GA_ald_EcoRI_rv, GA_rocG_RBS_
fw/GA_rocG_EcoRI_rv. For this purpose pTrc99A or

pQE30 plasmid were used and genomic DNA from B. 
subtilis and pKD13, respectively as template. The linear 
pTrc99A vector (cut with EcoRI) and overlapping DNA 
fragments were assembled to pTrc99A-kan -Ptrc-ald and 
pTrc99A-kan-Ptrc-rocG plasmids. All gene cassettes were 
amplified by PCR using primers with homologous arms 
consisting of 50 nucleotides upstream (HS_araCB_fw) 
and downstream (HS_araD _rv) of the araBAD  genes. 
The corresponding 3-kbp PCR products were purified, 
treated with DpnI, and then transformed by electropo

ration into E. coli W3110(Red/ET) using “Quick and 
Easy E. coli Gene Deletion Kit” (Gene Bridges, Heidel

Cells with homologous recombination were selected 
on an agar plate containing kanamycin and screened 
by colony PCR with araC_fw/Kt_rv primers. The anti

pCP20 encoding FLP-recombinase. The  Km

were transformed with temperature-sensitive plasmid 
pCP20 and  Amp

The elimination of antibiotic marker was verified by PCR 
(araC_fw/polB_rv). The helper plasmid was removed 
by strike out on non-selective plates at 43  °C. Newly 
obtained mutation strains were designated Ec-AlaDH 
(E. coli W3110ΔaraBAD ::Ptrc-ald) and Ec-GluDH (E.

or pTrc99A-ilvE Sm. For preparing the single-cell cata -
lysts used for “in vitro-type” reactions, strain Ec-AlaDH 
was transformed with plasmids pTrc99A-ta
Cv and 
pBAD28Δbla-fdh, pBAD28Δbla-gdh or pBAD28Δbla-
ptdh, respectively.
Media and cultivation conditions
Escherichia coli W3110 cells were grown in lysog -
eny broth (LB) complex medium (10  g  L −1 of tryptone, 
5 g L −1 of yeast extract, 10 g L −1 of sodium chloride) at 
37  °C in baffled Erlenmeyer flasks (60–1000  mL) on a 
rotary shaker at 120 rpm. Ampicillin (100 mg L
−1), kana-
mycin (50 mg L −1) and/or chloramphenicol (25 mg L −1) 
were added when appropriate. The growth of E. coli was 
monitored by measuring the optical density at 600  nm 
 (OD
600). Protein expression was induced at an  OD600 
of approximately 0.5–0.7 by the addition of isopropyl-
β-d-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, 0.25–1  mM) and/
or l-arabinose (0.02–0.3  vol%). Afterwards shaking was 
continued over night at 120 rpm and 20, 25, 30 or 37 °C, 
respectively. The cells were then harvested by centrifu
-
gation (2600–10,000×g for 10–30  min at 4  °C) and the 
resulting cell pellet was either applied directly in single-
cell biotransformations or stored at −20 °C until further 
use. By lyophilizing the single-cell biocatalyst, its storage 
at 4  °C was possible for several weeks without any sig
-
nificant loss of enzyme activity. For this purpose the cell 
pellet was resuspended in a minimum amount of sodium 
phosphate buffer  (NaP
i, 50 mM, pH 8, 0.5 mM PLP), fro -
zen in liquid nitrogen and lyophilized over night.
Preparation of cell‑free extracts
For preparation of cell-free extract the harvested cells 
were resuspended in  NaPi buffer (50  mM, pH 8) yield -
ing a 15 wt% cell solution. Cells were lysed by sonication 
treatment at 4 °C (15–60, 0.1 s sonicate, 0.4 s pause, 40% 
amplitude using a Branson Digital  Sonifier
®) and crude 
extract was centrifuged (13,000–16,000× for 10–30 min 
at 4  °C). The remaining cell debits were resuspended 
(15 vol%) in urea (6 M) for SDS-analysis. The supernatant 
was kept at 4 °C to be either applied directly in biotrans
-
formations or to be analyzed by activity assays and SDS-
PAGE. Otherwise, the supernatant was frozen in liquid 
nitrogen and lyophilized overnight yielding in lyophilized 
cell-free extract.
Fermentative production of l‑isoleucine and l‑leucine
For the production of l-isoleucine and l-leucine strains 
derived from E. coli W3110 were grown in LB medium 
supplemented with 1 mM IPTG and/or 0.3% l-arabinose 
at 37 °C and 200 rpm. Then the cells were washed twice 
with the medium salts (49 mM  KH
2PO4; 76 mM  K2HPO4 
for FDH and GDH or 125 mM  H3O3P for PtDH), resus -
pended and cultivated with an  OD600 of four in a chemi -
cally defined synthetic glycerol ammonium sulfate (SGA) 
medium as described previously [49]. As carbon source 
either 100  mM glucose for GDH, 100  mM sodium for
-
mate for FDH or 100  mM sodium hypophosphite for 
PtDH were used instead of glycerol. In the case of GDH 
the cells were cultured anaerobically for the production 
of l-isoleucine. When using PtDH, the phosphate com
-
ponents were replaced by phosphite components. For 
induction of expression 1 mM IPTG and/or 0.3% l-ara
-
binose were added to the cultures. For production of 
l-isoleucine 50 mM MOPS, 100 mM  (NH
4)2SO4, 50 mM 
2-keto-3-methylvalerate (KMV) and 0–250  mM  l-ala-
nine were added to the medium. For production of 
l-leucine 50  mM MOPS, 100  mM  (NH
4)2SO4, 50  mM 
2-keto-isocaproate (KIC) and 0–250  mM  l-glutamate 
were added to the medium. For quantification of extra -
cellular amino acids, aliquots of the culture were taken, 
cells were removed by centrifugation at 13,000×g for 
10 min, and the supernatants were frozen at −20 °C.

Toxicity tests
For the study of substrate toxicity batch cultivations with 
E. coli W3110 were performed in the  Biolector® cultiva-
tion system (m2p Labs, Baesweiler) using 1 mL medium 
microtiter plates (Flower  Plate
®, m2p Labs, Baesweiler) 
at 1100 rpm at 37 °C. The cells were grown in SGA mini -
mal medium with 1% Glucose and various concentrations 
(5, 20, 50, 100 and 200  mM) of sodium hypophosphite 
monohydrate  (NaH
2PO2  × H 2O), sodium phosphite 
dibasic pentahydrate  (Na2HPO3 × 5H2O), sodium phos -
phate monobasic monohydrate  (NaH2PO4  × H 2O) and 
sodium formate  (NaCO2H). The experiments were car -
ried out in triplicates.
Activity assays
All assays were performed with cell-free extracts in trip -
licates and one unit of enzyme activity (U) was calculated 
as the amount of enzyme catalyzing the conversion of 
1 µmol of substrate in 1 min. Protein concentration was 
determined by the Bio-Rad Protein Assay based on the 
method of Bradford [64] using bovine serum albumin as 
a reference standard.
Measurement of transaminase activity
The activities of AvtA and IlvE were measured as 
described before [65] using 10  mM keto acid (2-keto-
3-methylvalerate (KMV) or 2-keto-isocaproate (KIC) and 
50 mM amino donor (l-alanine for AvtA or l-glutamate 
for IlvE, respectively). The determination of  Ta
Cv activity 
was performed via an indirect photometric assay based 
on the reductive amination of pyruvate to l-alanine using 
(S)-methylbenzylamine as amine donor. For this purpose 
a substrate solution (990  µL) containing PLP (0.1  mM), 
(S)-methylbenzylamine (10  mM) and sodium pyruvate 
(5  mM) in  NaP
i buffer (50  mM, pH 8) was mixed with 
cell-free extract (10  µL) in a semi-micro UV-cuvette. 
Immediately, the increase of acetophenone formation 
(initial rate Δc/Δt) was measured over time at 290 nm.
Measurement of activities of amino acid dehydrogenases
The activities of AlaDH and GluDH were assayed based 
on the conversion of pyruvate to l-alanine with concomi
-
tant NADH consumption, which was monitored spectro-
photometrically at 340 nm as described before [65].
Measurement of activities of NADH‑recycling enzymes
The increase of NADH absorption at 340  nm was used 
for determining activities of NADH-recycling enzymes. 
FDH-activity was calculated based on the oxidation of 
formate with concomitant reduction of  NAD
+ to NADH. 
For measuring the activity of GDH β-d-glucose was con -
verted to d-glucono-1,5-lactone and in order to assaying 
PtDH activity phosphite was oxidized to phosphate. In 
all cases cell-free extract (10 µL) was added to a substrate 
solution (970  µL) containing  NAD
+ (1  mM) and either 
ammonium formate (100  mM), d-glucose (100  mM) or 
sodium phosphite (100 mM) in  NaP
i buffer (50 mM, pH 
8) and the increase of NADH absorption at 340 nm over 
time (initial rate Δc/Δt) was measured immediately.
Biotransformations
Biotransformations were performed in  NaPi buffer 
(50 mM, pH 8, 1 mM PLP) with l-alanine as amine donor 
and a substrate concentration of 25 mM. The particular 
co-substrate was applied according to the used cofactor-
recycling enzyme. Together with the FDH catalyzed recy
-
cling system ammonium formate was used, while for the 
GDH system glucose and for the PtDH system sodium 
phosphite was required. For the GDH and the PtDH 
system additionally ammonium acetate was needed as 
nitrogen donor. The recombinant E. coli catalyst was 
employed either in form of resting cells (50  mg resus
-
pended in 500 µL reaction buffer) or as cell-free extract 
(~350 µL, corresponding to 50 mg wet cells mixed with 
150  µL reaction buffer) in an Eppendorf tube (1.5  mL). 
Alternatively, lyophilized single-cells (corresponding to 
50  mg wet cells) or lyophilized cell-free extract (corre
-
sponding to 350  µL lysate) were rehydrated in reaction 
buffer for 15 min at 30 °C and 120 rpm prior to use. Then, 
reaction buffer (500  µL) containing l-alanine (250  mM, 
5  eq),  NAD
+ (2  mM), the particular co-substrate 
(300 mM, 6 eq) and ammonium acetate (150 mM, 3 eq) 
in case of GDH and PtDH recycling system was added. 
The reaction was started by the addition of the substrate 
4-phenyl-2-butanone (3.8  µL, 25  mM) and the mixture 
was shaken at 30 °C and 800 rpm for up to 48 h using an 
orbital shaker. After 4, 24 and 48 h, respectively 200 µL 
of each sample were withdrawn and the reaction was 
quenched with aqueous NaOH solution (20  µL, 10  M). 
After extraction with EtOAc (2  × 400 µL) the combined 
organic layers were dried over  Na
2SO4, and conversion as 
well as enantiomeric excess (ee) were analyzed by GC.
Determination of initial rates of single‑cell catalysts
The activity of the recombinant E. coli resting cells for the 
reductive amination of 4-phenyl-2-butanone to the cor
-
responding amine was assayed over 1–2 h. For this pur -
pose the biotransformation was performed according to 
the procedure described above. The reaction was stopped 
after 5, 10, 20, 40, 60 and 120 min, respectively by adding 
aqueous NaOH solution (20 µL, 10 M) and extracted with 
EtOAc (2  × 400 µL). The combined organic layers were 
dried over  Na
2SO4 and conversions were analyzed by 
GC. The enzyme activity (U) was defined as the amount 
of enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 1 µmol of sub-
strate per minute.

Analytical methods
Determination of conversion
Quantification of amino acid content in the fermenta -
tion reactions was performed using a high-pressure liq -
uid chromatography system (HPLC, 1200 series, Agilent 
Techologies Deutschland GmbH, Böblingen, Germany) 
and an automatic precolumn derivatization with ortho-
phthaldialdehyde. The amino acids were separated on a 
reversed phase column as described previously [66]. The 
conversion of 4-phenyl-2-butanone to 4-phenyl-2-but
-
ylamine was determined by GC-analysis (see chromato -
grams in Additional file  1: Figures S1, S2) on an Agilent 
7890 A GC system equipped with a flame ionization 
detector (FID) using  H
2 as carrier gas. Ketone and amine 
were separated on an achiral stationary phase using a 
14% cyanopropylphenyl phase capillary column (J&W 
Scientific DB-1701; 30 m  × 250 µm  × 0.25 µm) with an 
injection and detection temperature of 250 °C (tempera
-
ture program: 120 °C, 10 °C min−1 to 180 °C, 60 °C min−1 
to 280 °C, hold 2 min).
Determination of enantiomeric excess
For the determination of the enantiomeric excess (ee) the 
regarding samples were derivatized by incubating them 
with pyridine (2 eq) and acetic anhydride (5 eq) for 2 h 
at 40  °C and 800  rpm. The reaction was quenched with 
aqueous saturated  NaHCO
3 (250 µL) and extracted with 
EtOAc (2  × 250 µL). The combined organic layers were 
dried over  Na2SO4 and subsequently analyzed on GC. 
The two amine enantiomers were separated on a chiral 
stationary phase (see chromatograms in Additional file  1: 
Figures S3, S4.) using a β-cyclodextrin capillary column 
(CP-ChiraSil-DEX CB; 30 m  × 250 µm  × 0.25 µm) with 
an injection and detection temperature of 250  °C (tem
-
perature program: 120  °C, 5  °C  min −1 to 180  °C, hold 
2 min).
