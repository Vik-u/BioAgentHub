Successes in biocatalytic polyester recycling have raised the possibility of
deconstructing alternative polymers enzymatically, with polyamide (PA) being
a logical target due to the array of amide-cleaving enzymes present in nature.
Here, we screen 40 potential natural and engineered nylon-hydrolyzing
enzymes (nylonases), using mass spectrometry to quantify eight compounds
resulting from enzymatic nylon-6 (PA6) hydrolysis. Comparative time-course
reactions incubated at 40-70 °C showcase enzyme-dependent variations in
product distributions and extent of PA6ﬁlm depolymerization, with sig-
niﬁcant nylon deconstruction activity appearing rare. The most active
nylonase, a NylC
K variant we rationally thermostabilized (an N-terminal
nucleophile (Ntn) hydrolase, NylCK-TS, Tm = 87.4 °C, 16.4 °C higher than the
wild-type), hydrolyzes 0.67 wt% of a PA6ﬁlm. Reactions fail to restart after
fresh enzyme addition, indicating that substrate-based limitations, such as
restricted enzyme access to hydrolysable bonds, prohibit more extensive
deconstruction. Overall, this study expands our understanding of nylonase
activity distribution, indicates that Ntn hydrolases may have the greatest
potential for further development, and identiﬁes key targets for progressing
PA6 enzymatic depolymerization, including improving enzyme activity, pro-
duct selectivity, and enhancing polymer accessibility.
Polyamides (PAs), often referred to as nylons, are versatile, amide
bond-linked, petroleum-derived thermoplastics. Considered high-
performance materials, PAs are used in a range of applications,
including in textiles,ﬁshing nets, packaging, and medical devices
1.T h e
most prevalent nylons are PA6 and PA6,6, derived from caprolactam or
adipic acid and hexamethylene diamine monomers, respectively, with
a combined annual global consumption of 7.67 million tons in 2018
2.
The production of PA6 and PA6,6 is both energy- and greenhouse gas
(GHG) emissions-intensive, contributing a combined 197 MJ/kg of
energy use and 10.4 kg-CO
2e/kg GHG emissions for US nylon
consumption alone2. Furthermore, as with many anthropogenic poly-
mers, PA6 and PA6,6 are sparingly biodegradable, hence they can
accumulate in the environment
3. Circularization of the nylon economy
via recycling offers a potential avenue for reducing energy consump-
tion and GHG emissions, decreasing reliance upon fossil fuels, and
minimizing environmental impacts of PA waste
4,5. However, little post-
consumer nylon waste is currently collected, and recycling proves
challenging as PAs are often combined with other polymers
3,6.
Hence, to complement a number of currently successful, specialized
commercial PA recycling operations 7–10, and several promising

deconstruction methods described in the literature11–16, there is need
for a wider catalog of nylon recycling approaches to manage this
polymer at end-of-life
17, with selective techniques that release PA
monomers being of particular interest for closed-loop recycling18,19.
Chemical recycling using enzymes is an emerging approach with
the potential to become a selective method for plastic monomer
recovery
5,20. Excitingly, for poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), enzy-
matic recycling is advancing towards commercial deployment21,22.
Such successes in biocatalytic PET depolymerization have motivated
interest in emulating similar approaches with other polymers, with
interests mainly focused on other C–Oa n dC–N linked plastics
23,24,
including nylons. Indeed, PAs are a logical choice for enzymatic
depolymerization as both amide bonds and amide bond-hydrolyzing
enzymes are prevalent in nature. A keyﬁrst step is the identiﬁcation of
a biocatalyst capable of PA deconstruction, a potentially challenging
endeavor as the amide bonds in nylons exhibit limited accessibility due
to strong intermolecular hydrogen-bonding networks
25. Nevertheless,
several microorganisms with measurable PA biodegradation activity
have been reported
26–36, indicating that enzymatic nylon deconstruc-
tion may be achievable. The best-characterized nylon hydrolases
(hereafter, nylonases), NylC
p2 and NylB, were originally discovered in
Arthrobacter sp.K 1 7 237.N y l Cp2, an N-terminal nucleophile (Ntn)
hydrolase (EC 3.5.1.117), and NylB (E.C 3.5.1.46), a serine hydrolase with
a Ser-Tyr-Lys catalytic triad, are reported to catalyze hydrolysis of
oligomers and dimers of PA, respectively (Fig.1A)
38,39.N u m e r o u so t h e r
hydrolases have potential PA depolymerization activity, including Ser-
(cis)Ser-Lys containing amidases (EC 3.5.1.4), cutinases (EC 3.1.1.74)
using the canonical Ser-His-Asp (SHD) catalytic conﬁguration and
multiple proteases using either serine or cysteine residues as catalytic
nucleophiles (EC 3.4.21 & 3.4.22)
27,40–48. Taken together, these obser-
vations suggest that nylonase activity may be achieved by using mul-
tiple different enzyme active-site architectures.
With various potential nylonases described, there is an opportu-
nity to assess enzymes with a variety of catalytic residue architectures
for their propensity to deconstruct solid PAs. Previous studies have
necessarily used a wide variety of analyses and substrates to detect and
quantify biocatalytic nylon deconstruction. For instance, while some
studies use proxy measurements to evaluate nylon-active enzymes,
such as looking for polymer surface changes via rising-height
analysis
43,46, or using indicator compounds to identify the release of
amine-containing molecules49–51, others use soluble substrate analogs
to probe enzyme kinetics52, or look for changes in thickness of self-cast
nylon ﬁlms following enzyme application53. However, the large diver-
sity of experimental set-ups and substrates used across such studies,
makes a direct comparison of previously described enzymes challen-
ging. Hence, to identify nylonases with the most promising char-
acteristics, it would be advantageous to assess enzymes with self-
consistent reaction conditions, substrates, experimental protocols
and analysis methods, to ensure equitable comparisons
54–56. Taking
inspiration from the PETaseﬁeld, a high-throughput depolymerization
quantiﬁcation method that can assess the major soluble released
products following enzymatic nylon hydrolysis would be ideal57–59,i n
conjunction with rigorous characterization of the PA polymer sub-
strates used
5. Such analysis techniques could be leveraged to accel-
erate our understanding of nylonase action and may additionally aid in
the discovery and engineering of new nylon-active enzymes.
Here, we examined 40 proposed nylonases for their potential for
PA6 depolymerization (Fig.1B), selecting those with a range of enzyme
active-site architectures and a variety of previously described sub-
strate preferences. Within the enzyme set, we also included engi-
neered enzymes with high thermostability, a desirable characteristic to
enable polymer deconstruction near the glass transition temperature
(T
g)o ft h ep l a s t i c(Tg PA6 = ~50–55 °C)60, whereby substrate accessi-
bility may be increased61. These enzymes were tested for their ability to
hydrolyze PA6ﬁlms, using a high-throughput nylon depolymerization
analysis method based on liquid chromatography with tandem mass
spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), which accurately and simultaneously
detects and quantiﬁes linear-oligomers of PA6 up to pentamers, and
cyclic-oligomers up to trimers in a single sample. Product release
analysis was coupled with rigorous characterization of the PA6 mate-
rials used in the study, both pre- and post-enzymatic deconstruction.
Our results indicate that although measurable nylonase activity is
present in multiple enzymes, with different enzyme-dependent dis-
tributions of reaction products, Ntn hydrolases appear to be the most
active of the enzymes examined here. We present evidence that even
the best nylonases tested only hydrolyze a small portion of available
PA6, with between 0.1 and 0.7% of the PA6 depolymerized, depending
on the enzyme used. The most promising enzyme candidates were

subjected to additional characterization to explore depolymerization
extent as a function of reaction conditions. Because PA6 hydrolysis
plateaued in all cases, we further investigated reaction progression
with the top-performing enzyme, a thermostabilized NylC homolog,
NylC
K-TS, to better understand the depolymerization process. For
NylCK-TS, no further depolymerization was observed after fresh
enzyme addition, but additional product release was observed fol-
lowing addition of fresh PA6, indicating that enzyme failure does not
explain low depolymerization extents, and instead low extents of
deconstruction may be considered a substrate-based phenomenon.
Overall, our study highlights areas for future improvement necessary
to create a viable PA6 biocatalytic recycling strategy.
Results
Identiﬁcation, expression, and amide bond hydrolysis assays of
potential nylonases
We ﬁrst constructed a diverse set of enzymes, initially focusing on
biocatalysts with reported PA polymer or linear-oligomer decon-
struction activity from peer-reviewed literature and patents (Fig.1B,
Supplementary Data 1–2). As polymer chains become more accessible
near the glass transition temperature (T
g)o ft h es u b s t r a t e( f o rP A 6 ,
Tg ~5 0–55 °C), enzyme thermotolerance was chosen as a desirable
characteristic, and hence, was considered when selecting candidates62.
As demonstrated by Negoro et al., NylCp2 and its homologs (Ntn
hydrolases) have previously been shown to exhibit activity on PA6
cyclic oligomers, linear oligomers and solid PA6 (powder and thin
ﬁlm)
24,37,49,53,63, whilst NylB and its homologs have been shown to
exhibit PA6 dimer hydrolysis activity38,39.A m i d a s e sh a v ea l s ob e e n
used for PA6 modiﬁcation. One of these enzymes, NfPolyA, an amidase
signature (AS) family protein fromNocardia farcinica, had also been
reported to exhibit polyurethane (PUR)-hydrolyzing activity, hence,
we included some known polyurethanases and urethanases, hypo-
thesizing that these enzymes may also exhibit activity on PA
23,64.
Additional Ntn hydrolases and AS family enzyme candidates were
selected following NylC
p2 and NfPolyA homolog searches, selecting
enzymes from potentially thermotolerant sources. Numerous reports
suggest serine hydrolases with the canonical Ser-His-Asp (SHD) cata-
lytic triad including cutinases, and proteases using either serine or
cystine catalytic nucleophiles, exhibit promiscuous activity for nylon
surface modiﬁcation
44–48,50,65. Thus, these enzymes were also added to
the set. A number of the cutinases described also had PET depoly-
merization activity, hence, several other PET-active SHD hydrolases
were added, including some previously engineered thermostabilized
variants
21,58, with the hope that they may also exhibit PA
depolymerization.
Following selection, enzymes were broadly categorized into six
main groupings dependent on both their catalytic activities and pre-
viously described substrate preferences (Fig. 1B, Supplementary
Data 1). Enzymes found by homology searches were put in the same
group as the query enzyme, whilst those where no natural substrate was
described in the original publications were assigned functionality using
BLAST searches
66. The groupings used from here on are as follows: (1)
NylC-type enzymes, Ntn-hydrolases found to hydrolyze PA6 trimers
and longer PA oligomers, (2) NylB-type enzymes, serine hydrolases (Ser-
Tyr-Lys catalytic triad) previously demonstrated to speciﬁcally hydro-
lyze PA dimers, (3) amidases, AS family enzymes that act on linear
amides or urethane bond containing compounds, (4) Ser-His-Asp
hydrolases (SHD-hydrolases), serine hydrolases with a substrate pre-
ference for ester-linked polymers, (5) proteases, serine and cystine
proteases that cleave peptide bonds in proteins, and (6) miscellaneous
(misc.), enzymes that do not fall into one of the otherﬁve main
groupings. Manganese peroxidases (MnPs), which have previously
been implicated in PA hydrolysis

their radical-based reaction leads to diverse product mixtures that may
be less desirable for a closed-loop circular recycling process
6,22.
Inspired by the successful homology-based thermostability
enhancement of NylCp2 by Negoro et al. (NylCp2 D122G/H130Y/D36A/
E263Q,Tm increase of 36 °C, demonstrated hydrolytic activity on solid
PA6 powder)49, we also rationally mutated NylCs fromAgromyces
(NylCA)a n dKocuria (NylCK) to increase their melting temperatures
(Tms)37,49,67. In both enzymes, residues previously described as poten-
tially destabilizing were substituted for their homologous counter-
parts in NylCp2 (S111G and A137L), with E263Q additionally being
introduced into NylCA as a potential stabilizing mutation from NylCK.
These mutations increased proteinTm by 16.4 °C and 25.1 °C for NylCK-
TS and NylCA-TS, respectively (NylCK-TS, Tm =8 7 . 4° C , N y l CA-TS,
Tm = 87.1 °C, Supplementary Fig. 1). As a three-point mutant of NylB’
(NylB homolog fromArthrobacter sp.K 1 7 2 ,N y l B’-SCY: R187S/F264C/
D370Y)39 was demonstrated to have enhanced PA6 dimer hydrolysis
activity, we introduced the corresponding mutations into NylB (from
Arthrobacter sp. K172), to generate NylB-SCY, hoping that the muta-
tions would impart additional PA depolymerization activity. The
resulting panel of WT and engineered enzymes comprised of 41
candidates.
Five enzymes were procured from commercial sources; of the 36
enzymes not available commercially, 35 were successfully expressed
and puriﬁed fromEscherichia coli(expression summaries detailed in
Supplementary Data 2), to give a 40-member candidate pool. To test
the ability of each enzyme for amide bond hydrolysis, candidates
were incubated with N-(4-nitrophenyl)butanamide (N4NB), a small
molecule surrogate that contains a butyramide motif akin to the amide
bonds in PA6 (0.5 mM N4NB, 2µM enzyme, 30 °C in reaction buffer
(100 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl), Fig.2,
Supplementary Fig. 2A-I). Successful hydrolytic cleavage of the amide
bond in N4NB results in the release ofp-nitroaniline (p-NA), which can
be monitored spectrophotometrically. The amidases
64,68–71 (Supple-
mentary Fig. 2D–F) and NylB-type enzymes39,72,73 (Supplementary
Fig. 2A) exhibited the highest levels of amide hydrolysis activity, with
the UMG-SP enzymes
23 (metagenomic amidases), NfPolyA64 (poly-
amidase fromN. farcinica), GatA69 (amidase of unspeciﬁed origin), and
MsmegA (metagenomic amidase) completely converting 500 µM
N4NB in underﬁve minutes, whilst ReU70 (Rhodococcus equiTB-60
urethanase), OoH71 (ω-octalactam hydrolase), and NylB’-SCY39 reached
100% conversion in under 30 minutes. The NylC-type enzymes37,67,74,75
(Supplementary Fig. 2B, C) and SHD-hydrolases21,42,58,76–82 (Supple-
mentary Fig. 2H, I) exhibited a wider range of activities. The highest
performers in these two groups, NylC
A
67 and AoC76 (Aspergillus oryzae
cutinase), displayed 16.2 and 29.3µM/h p-NA production, respectively,
during the linear phase of the reaction, and the poorest performers, M-
NylC (Microbacterium sp. NylC) and LCC-ICCG21 (engineered cutinase
from leaf/compost metagenome), only had detectable activity after 8 h
and 12 h, respectively. Interestingly, none of the proteases (α-chymo-
trypsin, papain, subtilisin, and trypsin
48, Supplementary Fig. 2G) had
any detectable hydrolysis activity under the tested reaction condi-
tions; this may be due to the difference in chemical properties between
N4NB and the protease’s natural substrates.
Development of a high-throughput solid PA6 depolymerization
analysis method by LC-MS/MS
We next sought to thoroughly characterize the ability of the potential
nylonase panel to deconstruct solid PA6. Due to the lack of a strong
chromophore in the predicted products and the desire for sub part per
million (ppm) detection limits, we developed a high-throughput liquid
chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis
method (published on protocols.io, [ https://doi.org/10.17504/
protocols.io.6qpvr3k92vmk/v1])
83 to monitor the major predicted
soluble released compounds following PA6 depolymerization reac-
tions. Utilizing tandem mass spectrometry enabled rapid analyses.
When operating in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, the
instrumentation and detection is optimized for each compound,

making the mass transitions highly selective and unique to each ana-
lyte, and thus eliminating the need for chromatographic peak
separation or product derivatization, signiﬁcantly reducing analy-
sis time.
Using this ex-situ analysis method, linear-oligomers of
6-aminohexanoic acid (6-AHA) from monomer to pentamer and cyclic-
oligomers fromε-caprolactam to trimer were all detected in under
three minutes, representing a signiﬁcant advancement in the speed
and diversity of potential products quantiﬁed (Fig.3A). The use of a
multisampler allows eight 96-well plates to be analyzed without man-
ual intervention, with around 20 samples being analyzed per hour.
Reaction samples were arrayed across 96-well plates, with a calibration
veriﬁcation standard (CVS) evaluated every 20 wells to ensure accurate
quantiﬁcation and system stability, demonstrating the suitability of
this method for high-throughput analyses
83.All analytes were detect-
able from 0.01–7.0 µg/mL, with samples above the upper quantitation
Fig. 2 |N-(4-nitrophenyl)butanamide (N4NB) activity assays with potential
nylonases.All successfully expressed enzymes were tested for their ability to
hydrolyze the amide bond in N4NB, leading to the release ofp-nitroaniline (p-NA,
monitored spectrophotometrically at 410 nm) and butyric acid (BA). The bar chart
shows the conversion extent of N4NB top-NA after 5 h of reaction using 0.5 mM
N4NB and 2µM enzyme at 30 °C in reaction buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate
buffer (NaPi), pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl). Enzymes are colored by their group from Fig.1,

limit further diluted to enable quantiﬁcation in the calibration range.
Calibration curves were run prior to each set of samples analyzed to
account for mass spectrometry signal drift (Fig.3B). The linear 6-AHA
products from monomer to trimer and cyclic products from ε-
caprolactam to 6-AHA cyclic-dimer were quantiﬁed using commercial
standards. The linear 6-AHA tetramer and pentamer were quantiﬁed by
applying the calibration curve from 6-AHA linear trimer; the 6-AHA
cyclic-trimer was quantiﬁed utilizing the calibration curve from the
6-AHA cyclic-dimer responses.
Assessment of potential nylonases on a solid PA6 substrate
With a robust nylon depolymerization analysis method in hand, we
next sought to examine the capabilities of our enzyme panel for PA6
deconstruction. For activity screens, commercially available PA6ﬁlm
from Goodfellow was used as the substrate (13.2% crystallinity by dif-
ferential scanning calorimetry (DSC), 0.2 mm thickness, full material
characterization detailed in Supplementary Table 1, with DSC, gel
permeation chromatography (GPC) and thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) plots shown in Supplementary Fig. 3A–C).
PA6 ﬁlm was washed with DI water prior to use, as detailed in the
Methods section, to remove surface-bound cyclic-oligomer by-
products created during the nylon manufacturing process
84.R e a c -
tions comparing the enzyme panel were conducted for 10 days at
temperatures from 40 to 70 °C, with time points taken at 24, 72, 168,
and 240 h (Supplementary Fig. 4). Control assays without enzyme led
to minimal release of linear 6-AHA oligomers, with the 6-AHA mono-
mer below the limit of detection across all tested temperatures when
no enzyme was present (Supplementary Fig. 5A). Enzyme reactions
were carried out in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (NaPi), pH 7.5,
150 mM NaCl, and contained 2μM enzyme and 13 mg PA6 (two squares
of 0.5 × 0.5 cm PA6ﬁlm), representing a substrate loading and an
enzyme/substrate loading in the reactions of 0.65 wt% and 0.15 mM
enzyme/g PA6 ﬁlm, respectively, unless otherwise stated. Although
polymer deconstructions may be surface-area limited processes, the
enzyme/substrate loading is referred to throughout as amount of
enzyme per mass of PA6 as is good practice for enzymatic depoly-
merization reactions
54,56,85. Across all tested enzymes, the extent ofε-
caprolactam release was consistent; for most enzymes assayed, con-
centrations of the 6-AHA cyclic-dimer and cyclic-trimer also remained
constant during the reaction (Supplementary Fig. 5B). Hence, for
clarity, only the linear products are presented graphically, with cyclic
products mentioned only when their levels changed. The linear oli-
gomers (from monomer to trimer) appear robust to incubation for
extended time periods at 40–80 °C, with an average recovery (as
measured by LC-MS/MS) across all time points and temperatures of
96.4% ± 9.2, 99.9% ± 6.3 and 104.3% ± 7.2 of individually incubated
10 µg/mL standards of 6-AHA monomer, 6-AHA dimer and 6-AHA tri-
mer, respectively (Supplementary Table 2). These results indicate that
changes in oligomer levels seen in reactions can be attributed mainly
to enzyme action. As a note, although the nylonase deconstruction
assays presented below were all conducted with puriﬁed proteins, the
LC-MS/MS analytical method is unaffected by instead using crude cell
lysate (Supplementary Fig. 6) as the biocatalytic agent, with a similar
product release proﬁle witnessed as compared to using puriﬁed pro-
tein (Supplementary Fig. 7). To aid comparisons of total PA6 depoly-
merization extent in each reaction, the detected soluble released
products are presented as their 6-AHA equivalents.
Nylonase activity was observed across a range of enzymes from
the different groups tested: overall, 31 enzymes demonstrated mea-
surable activity, while nine enzymes exhibited minimal detectable
additional soluble product release above background levels (Fig.4,
Supplementary Figs. 8–13). The temperatures for optimal activity
ranged from 40 to 70 °C, with, in general, higher levels of soluble
product release seen with increasing temperatures. Interestingly, there
appears to be different distributions of products released across the
different enzyme groups. Namely, NylB-type enzymes, GatA, and UMG-
SP-1 mainly produce 6-AHA monomer, whilst most amidases and
cutinases release a mixture of linear products, with very little 6-AHA
pentamer seen for many of the amidases. The most active NylC-type
enzyme reactions, however, are dominated by 6-AHA dimer. It is
important to note that only one pH and buffer condition was tested, so
it is possible that relationships between different enzyme activities
seen here may be altered by more extensive optimization of reaction
conditions for each individual enzyme.
By far the most active enzymes were from the NylC-type group,
with NylC
p2,N y l CA,N y l CK, and their engineered variants identiﬁed as
the top-performers, being between two and six-fold more active than
the best enzymes from other groups. The signiﬁcant accumulation of
linear 6-AHA trimer in the reactions with the NylC variants found via
homology searches is probably a result of their lower propensity for
trimer hydrolysis. For instance, NylC
K-TS hydrolyzes 100% of 50µM
6-AHA trimer to dimer and monomer in under 30 minutes at reaction
conditions, while trimer hydrolysis is much slower with Tt-NylC
(Thermocatellispora tengchongensisNylC), where 67.1% trimer remains
afterﬁve hours (pH 7.5 NaPi buffer, 150 mM NaCl, 2µM enzyme, 60 °C)
(Supplementary Fig. 14A, B). As the 6-AHA dimer remains intact at
reaction conditions in the presence of NylC
K-TS after 24 h (100µM
dimer, pH 7.5 NaPi buffer, 150 mM NaCl, 2µMN y l CK-TS, Supplemen-
tary Fig. 14C), monomer accumulation in reactions containing NylCp2,
NylCA,N y l CK,a n dt h e i rv a r i a n t sm a yb ed u et ot h ef a s th y d r o l y s i so f
released trimers to 6-AHA dimer and monomer. Thermostabilizing
mutations appeared beneﬁcial as hypothesized, with all NylC-TS var-
iants showing increased activity at 70 °C (Supplementary Fig. 8, Fig.4),
compared to 50-60 °C optimal temperatures for their wild-type (WT)
counterparts. However, interestingly, these mutations also appeared
to slow the hydrolysis of the 6-AHA cyclic-trimer, which is a known

(Tm =8 7 . 4 ° C ) ( F i g s .4 and 5A), which was even active up to 80 °C
(Supplementary Fig. 16). In comparative reactions of NylCK-WT and
NylCK-TS at 40-60 °C the total released products and reaction proﬁles
are highly comparable (1µM enzyme and 13 mg PA6, 0.08µM/g PA6,
0.65 wt% substrate loading, pH 7.5 NaPi buffer, 150 mM NaCl, Supple-
mentary Fig. 16). However, from 70-80 °C, NylCK-TS has a higher
overall yield of soluble products after 10 days (Supplementary Fig. 16).
Comparing both enzymes at the temperatures which led to the highest
product release (50 °C and 80 °C, respectively), NylC
K-TS starts pro-
ducing more 6-AHA equivalents from 3 h of reaction onwards, releas-
ing 28.8% more 6-AHA equivalents over the course of 10 days (1µM
enzyme and 13 mg PA6, 0.08 mM enzyme/g PA6, 0.65 wt% substrate
loading, pH 7.5 NaPi buffer, 150 mM NaCl, Fig.5B). Despite the promise
of the overall best performing enzyme NylC
K-TS, the highest soluble
PA6 oligomer release seen (339.7µM of 6-AHA equivalents) only
equates to 0.67 wt% PA6 depolymerization extent.
Intriguingly, although NylB appears sparingly active for PA6ﬁlm
deconstruction, NylB’, a NylB homolog with 88% sequency identity,
released 72.9µM6 - A H Ae q u i v a l e n t so v e r1 0d a y sa t4 0° C( F i g .4B,
Supplementary Fig. 9). The three-point NylB’ variant, NylB’-SCY, is even
more active and additionally more thermostable, with optimal 6-AHA
equivalent release at 50 °C (130.2µM 6-AHA equivalents), corre-
sponding to 0.26 wt% PA6 deconstruction after 10 days of reaction.
Although the NylB’-WT scaffold appears to be the driving force for
increased PA6 hydrolysis activity compared to NylB-WT, the R187S/
F264C/D370Y mutations also appear to have an effect as NylB-SCY is
three-fold more active than NylB-WT. However, as the total 6-AHA
equivalents released over 10 days at 40 °C by NylB-SCY was <8.0µM,
the overall effect on PA6 depolymerization was negligible. NylB’-SCY
readily hydrolyzes both 6-AHA dimer and trimer at reaction conditions
(pH 7.5 NaPi buffer, 150 mM NaCl, 2µMN y l B’-SCY, 50 °C), with 100µM
dimer or 50µM trimer completely converted to monomer in under

30 minutes (Supplementary Fig. 17A, B). Based on these experimental
results, it is difﬁcult to identify whether the accumulation of 6-AHA

hydrolysis to monomer, or whether NylB’-SCY exclusively releases
6-AHA monomer from polymer chain ends.

reaction proﬁles and product distributions of all of the biocatalysts
tested from this group suggest a similar mode of action, with the
mixture of soluble oligomers released indicating non-speciﬁc cleavage
of surface residues, rather than coordinated, progressive depolymer-
ization activity (Supplementary Fig. 10). Support for this mode of
action comes from the most active SHD-hydrolase tested, LCC-ICCG
(Fig. 4B), which produces only 49.8µM of 6-AHA equivalents over the
course of 10 days at 70 °C, corresponding to 0.09 wt% depolymer-
ization of the PA6ﬁlm. The observation that mixtures of oligomers are
retained over the 10 days of reaction additionally suggests that there is
limited further deconstruction of these soluble linear products by
SHD-hydrolases. Indeed, incubation of LCC-ICCG with 50µM6 - A H A
trimer for 24 h at reaction conditions (pH 7.5 NaPi buffer, 150 mM NaCl,
2 µM LCC-ICCG, 70 °C), leads to negligible turnover to dimer or
monomer (Supplementary Fig. 17C).
Similarly, low extents of depolymerization are also observed for
the amidases, potentially due to their low thermotolerance, with most
becoming deactivated above 40 °C (Fig.4A, Supplementary Fig. 11).

The limited activity of these enzymes was surprising, as the amidases
were among the most active enzymes from the initial screens on N4NB.
However, as the active sites of NfPolyA and its homologs are buried
within the enzyme core, their ability to bind and access amide bonds in
polymer chains is likely more restricted (Supplementary Fig. 18). GatA
and UMG-SP-2 produced the most 6-AHA equivalents (109.6µMa n d
126.3µM, respectively, over 10 days at 40 °C) amongst the amidases
(Fig. 4B), corresponding to 0.2–0.25% PA6ﬁlm depolymerization. The
interesting preference of GatA for 6-AHA monomer release is in part due
to its nylon oligomer hydrolysis ability; GatA can hydrolyze linear pro-
ducts, with 67% of 100µM 6-AHA dimer and 100% of 50µM6 - A H A
trimer hydrolyzed under reaction conditions (pH 7.5 NaPi buffer,
150 mM NaCl, 2µM GatA, 40 °C) within 24 h (Supplementary Fig. 19A, B),
but it also hydrolyzes cyclic oligomers. GatA completely depletes 6-AHA
cyclic-trimer during PA6ﬁlm reactions (Supplementary Fig. 20), with
6-AHA cyclic-dimer also being a substrate for the enzyme (Supple-
mentary Fig. 21A, B), indicating that a proportion of the monomer
release observed is the product of hydrolysis of these surface con-
taminants. Interestingly, UMG-SP-1 also has a preference for monomer
release (Supplementary Fig. 11). UMG-SP-1 is similarly able to hydrolyze
small PA6 oligomers, hydrolyzing both 100µM6 - A H Ad i m e ra n d5 0µM
6-AHA trimer to produce a majority 6-AHA monomer product at reac-
tion conditions (pH 7.5 NaPi buffer, 150 mM NaCl, 2µMU M G - S P - 1 ,4 0
°C) within 24 h (Supplementary Fig. 18C, D), with 6-AHA cyclic-trimer
also appearing to be a substrate for this enzyme (Supplementary
Fig. 20). Hence, product preference for the amidases does not appear as
consistent as with other enzyme groups tested here, with soluble oli-
gomer distributions following PA6 depolymerizations being highly
enzyme dependent. As with the SHD-hydrolases, the low rates of
depolymerization for all the amidases again currently suggests a surface
modiﬁcation process rather than signiﬁcant bulk PA6 depolymerization.
No measurable PA6 depolymerization activity was seen for any of
the proteases or miscellaneous category enzymes tested here (Sup-
plementary Figs. 12 and 13). A possibility is that these enzymes may
cleave polyamides, but release products of a higher molecular weight
than what our analysis method detects. However, a lack of subsequent
depolymerization down to smaller molecular weight oligomers or
monomers suggests that the usefulness of these six enzymes may be
limited.
In-depth characterization of a selection of the best performing
enzymes
We were interested to examine a subset of the best performing
enzymes, including NylCK-TS, Tt-NylC, and NylB’-SCY, to test if the rate
and extent of PA6 depolymerization could be improved and the mode
of action understood. NylB’-SCY reactions were carried out at 50 °C, its
highest operating temperature, while NylC-type enzyme reactions were
conducted at 60 °C to allow fair comparison between homologs. For all
three enzymes, increasing the substrate loading from 0.32-1.6 wt% (one
to ﬁve squares of PA6ﬁlm, keeping enzyme concentration constant at
1 µM enzyme, 100 mM NaPi buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) leads to
greater product release, most likely due to an increase in available
reactive surface area (Fig.6A). Product distributions remain constant
for both NylC
K-TS and NylB’-SCY at all substrate loadings, while the
6-AHA trimer accumulates in Tt-NylC depolymerization reactions.
Increasing enzyme loading (keeping PA6ﬁlm mass constant at
13 mg PA6ﬁlm, 0.65 wt% substrate loading, 100 mM NaPi buffer, pH
7.5, 150 mM NaCl), surprisingly, had little effect on total PA6ﬁlm
depolymerization (Fig.6B). 6-AHA equivalent release never surpassed
300 µM under any condition, with improvements in total NylCK-TS
depolymerization stalling above 0.1µM enzyme in the reaction (8µM
enzyme/g PA6). However, interestingly at low NylCK-TS enzyme load-
ings, where the reaction rate will be slowed, a higher proportion of
6-AHA trimer to pentamer products was observed. A proportion of
NylC
K-TS PA6 hydrolysis events may therefore be random, producing
mixed length oligomers that are subsequently hydrolyzed to dimer
and monomer. Slowed oligomer hydrolysis in low enzyme loading
reactions additionally suggests a preference of NylC
K-TS for release of
product from the polymer surface over hydrolysis of oligomers in
solution. Reactions with Tt-NylC support this hypothesis as trimer
levels were only reduced at very high enzyme loadings. These trends,
however, are not observed for NylB’-SCY: even at the lowest enzyme
loading, only 6-AHA is produced. As an important consideration for
further application, signiﬁcantly less NylC
K-TS was required to achieve
the highest levels of total depolymerization (0.1µMN y l CK-TS, 8µM
enzyme/g PA6, equivalent to 0.58 mg enzyme/g PA6), compared to
both Tt-NylC or NylB’-SCY (10µM enzyme, 0.77 mM enzyme/g PA6,
equivalent to 54.6 mg enzyme/g PA6 and 66.9 mg enzyme g/ PA6, for
Tt-NylC and NylB’-SCY, respectively).

Variation of reaction pH from pH 6-10 (1µMe n z y m ea n d1 3 m g
PA6, 0.08 mM enzyme/g PA6, substrate loading 0.65 wt%, 100 mM
buffer, 150 mM NaCl) also did not elicit higher levels of PA depoly-
merization; however, it did reveal differences in pH tolerance amongst
the three enzymes (Supplementary Fig. 22). NylC
K-TS was mostly
unaffected by pH changes, with Tt-NylC being similarly pH-robust with
drops in activity only seen at the extremities of the pH range tested.
Conversely, NylB’-SCY is particularly sensitive to pH changes: pH 7 is
optimal with signiﬁcant decreases in activity either side of this, and
complete deactivation from pH 9-10.
Examination of the reaction proﬁle of NylCK-TS
We next sought to identify what was limiting the enzymatic depoly-
merization of PA6 and causing the observed asymptotic reaction
proﬁles, using the most active enzyme, NylC
K-TS, as the test case. We
identiﬁed slight crystallinity increases in the PA6 substrate in no
enzyme control reactions in reaction buffer (100 mM NaPi buffer, pH
7.5, 150 mM NaCl) at 70 °C (maximum 3.2% increase in crystallinity by
DSC over 10 days), hence, reactions were carried out at 60 °C where
this effect was less noticeable (maximum 0.2% increase in crystallinity
by DSC over 10 days) (Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 23).
Reactions contained 1µM of enzyme and 13 mg of PA6 (0.08 mM
enzyme/g PA6, substrate loading of 0.65 wt%), in 100 mM pH 7.5 NaPi
buffer and 150 mM NaCl. To rule out effects of incubation-induced PA6
changes during the reaction, we conducted NylC
K-TS depolymeriza-
tions using PA6ﬁlm incubated in reaction buffer at 60 °C for either
three or seven days prior to enzyme addition. As there was no sig-
niﬁcant difference between the product release of pre-incubated PA6

Interestingly, including bovine serum albumin (BSA) in reactions
allows for the same level of PA6 depolymerization with 100-fold less

loading of 0.65 wt%, 0.5µM BSA, 100 mM NaPi buffer, 150 mM NaCl,
pH 7.5, 60 °C, Fig.7A, Supplementary Fig. 24B). Increasing the con-
centration of BSA in PA6 deconstruction assays (from 0.5 to 2µM),
does not promote additional depolymerization, indicating that BSA is
not promoting further PA6 hydrolysis, but is instead acting to enhance
NylC
K-TS speciﬁc activity (Supplementary Fig. 24B). Additional evi-
dence for this is that the promotion of activity only occurs at lower
NylC
K-TS concentrations (0.01µM enzyme), with addition of BSA to
reactions containing 1µMN y l CK-TS leading to no additional beneﬁt
(Supplementary Fig. 24C). As BSAis known to prevent non-speciﬁc
binding in reactions, we believe theseﬁndings suggest that the activity
of NylCK-TS may be substantially impacted by non-productive PA6
binding events. Alternatively, BSA may coat the reaction vessel, redu-
cing enzyme adsorption to these surfaces, hence promoting mass
transfer of NylC
K-TS to the polymer surface. More extensive explora-
tion of this phenomenon may be necessary to help guide future NylCK-
TS engineering efforts or may suggest new ways to promote faster or
additional PA6 depolymerization.
Reaction progress was not recovered by supplementation with
fresh NylC
K-TS after either three or seven days of enzyme reaction
(Fig. 7B, Supplementary Fig. 24D). However, addition of new PA6
substrate (13 mg) to a NylCK-TS depolymerization reaction that had
been running for three days (the start of reaction plateau), led to
additional product release of a similar magnitude as from the original
substrate, with the same relationship seen after substrate addition to a
seven-day reaction (Fig.7B, Supplementary Fig. 24D). Reaction proﬁles
following new substrate addition match 6-AHA equivalent release seen
in standard reactions like those shown in Figs.5 and 6, indicating that
NylC
K-TS retains almost full activity after both three and seven days of
Fig. 7 | Exploration of PA6 depolymerization plateau using NylCK-TS as a

reaction at 60 °C, and that there are no inhibitory compounds present
which could explain reaction stalling. Characterization of the PA6ﬁlms
by GPC suggests that there were no extensive changes in the number
average molar mass (M
n) or molar mass dispersity (Đ)o ft h eP A 6
polymer chains following 10 days of enzyme incubation with NylCK-TS
at any temperature (Supplementary Table. 3, Supplementary Fig. 25A).
There were also no signiﬁcant differences in the percentage crystal-
linity of the PA6 substrate incubated with or without enzyme over the
course of 10 days, as measured by DSC (Supplementary Fig. 25B). As a
note, TGA analysis revealed that the PA6ﬁlm absorbed an average of
1.9 wt% water following 10 days incubation in reaction buffer across all
temperatures (no enzyme controls), and there was no noticeable dif-
ference in substrate water absorption in reactions with NylC
K-TS
(average of 1.7 wt% across all temperatures) (Supplementary Table. 3,
Supplementary Fig. 25C).
Taken together, these results suggest that the reaction plateau for
NylC
K-TS is a consequence of lack of remaining hydrolysable substrate
for this enzyme following 10 days of reaction. Furthermore, typically
for more extensive enzymatic plastic depolymerizations, both rate and
extent of deconstruction are highly sensitive to substrate
crystallinity
61. However, for PA6 depolymerization with NylCK-TS,
using a more crystalline PA6ﬁlm substrate (23.0% crystallinity by DSC,
prepared in house, full material characterization in Supplementary
Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 26), leads to a comparable amount of
6-AHA equivalents release compared to reactions with the Goodfellow
ﬁlm that is more amorphous (13.2% crystallinity by DSC, Fig.7C).
Hence, we can conclude that NylC
K-TS is likely only working on a small
amount of accessible nylon polymer on theﬁlm surface, and so does
not reach the depolymerization extents at which substrate crystallinity
would play a role in reaction progression. Indeed, SEM images of PA6
incubated with NylC
K-TS (1 µM enzyme, 0.08 mM enzyme/g PA6,
0.65 wt% substrate loading, 100 mM pH 7.5 NaPi buffer, 150 mM NaCl,
60 °C, 10 days), reveal a slight surface roughening, but no signiﬁcant
pits or features that are commonly associated with more extensive
biocatalytic polymer deconstruction (Fig. 7D, Supplementary
Fig. 27)
58,86. As these results indicate a surface area-limited process, we
attempted to alter the surface area of the available PA6 substrate whilst
retaining the same mass. Typically, this is done by using a powdered
substrate; however, we found that enzymatic assays with PA6 powder
(sourced from Goodfellow, particle size: 5–50 µm, full material char-
acterization detailed in Supplementary Table 3) were very difﬁcult to
standardize due to reaction volume changes over the course of incu-
bation (Supplementary Fig. 28). Additionally, the powder exhibited a
high crystallinity (47.6% crystallinity by DSC), which may be undesir-
able. Hence, we conducted assays using the same mass of a thicker PA6
ﬁlm (PA6 thickﬁlm, 0.5 mm thickness, 13 mg = two 0.32 ×0.32 cm
squares, sourced from Goodfellow, full material characterization
detailed in Supplementary Table 3), representing a ~ 50% reduction in
PA6 surface area in each reaction compared to our standard 0.2 mm
thicknessﬁlm. Using the PA6 thickﬁlm, product release proceeded at a
slower rate, with 34% fewer 6-AHA oligomers released over the course
of 10 days, compared to the standard PA6ﬁlm (1µMo fe n z y m e ,
0.08 mM enzyme/g PA6, 0.65 wt% substrate loading, 100 mM pH 7.5
NaPi buffer, 150 mM NaCl, 60 °C, Supplementary Fig. 29), conﬁrming
that surface area is indeed a factor controlling both rate of reaction
and extent of depolymerization.
Discussion
There is increasing interest in expanding the successes of enzymatic
PET deconstruction to other plastics including nylon
21,57,58,87,88.T o
effectively accomplish this requires both candidate enzymes to
underpin the discovery, engineering, and evolution of improved
enzymes, and suitable analytical methods. Using a high-throughput
LC-MS/MS-based analysis strategy, we explored the PA6 deconstruc-
tion capacity of a diverse panel of potential nylonases, including
candidates not previously examined for PA6 hydrolysis. We demon-
strate that enzymes from a wide variety of sources exhibit sparing
abilities to release soluble oligomeric products from a PA6ﬁlm.
Enzymes with the canonical Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad and the ami-
dases were shown to exhibit low propensities for PA6 depolymeriza-
tion. Perhaps unsurprisingly, there was little correlation between
the capacity for an enzyme to hydrolyze the soluble N4NB substrate
relative to solid PA6 deconstruction: our ﬁndings indicate that
soluble substrates such as N4NB may be used to indicate poor nylo-
nase activity but are not good indicators of high nylonase performance
on solid PA6. Features necessary for plastic depolymerization, such as
enzyme-polymer surface binding and release, ability to hydrolyze an
insoluble solid, and potential for the active site to accommodate bulky
polymer chains, tend not to be well captured by soluble substrate
hydrolysis assays, hence, studies of this kind, which accurately identify
potential nylonases on realistic substrates, are vital. Although it is
unlikely that the SHD-hydrolases and amidases studied here are
immediately suitable for a PA6 recycling process, for reasons ranging
from low depolymerization rates, thermal stability, poor expression
levels, and mixed pools of reaction products
89,90,t h e ym a yﬁnd use in
fabric industries. Cutinases and amidases have been previously used to
improve the surface qualities of nylon fabric, whilst GatA, an enzyme
initially identiﬁed as a polyurethanase, may prove useful for improving
the quality of spunﬁbers, by hydrolyzing undesirable cyclic nylon
polymerization by-products
47,50. Interestingly, many of the nylon-
active cutinases have previously been implicated in PET
hydrolysis21,58,91–93, with a number also having demonstrated poly-
urethanase and urethanase activity23,64,69,70,82,94, indicating that the
cross-reactivity of enzymes may be something that can be exploited to
discover biocatalysts for different plastic deconstruction campaigns in
the future.
Although NylB-type enzymes have previously reported activity on
various soluble nylon oligomers, we demonstrate that they can act also
on solid PA6, with NylB’-SCY being the most active (highest depoly-
merization extent seen of 0.42 wt% PA6ﬁlm using 10µMN y l B’-SCY,
0.77 mM enzyme/g PA6, equivalent to 66.9 mg enzyme/g PA6). The
wide difference in activity between NylB and NylB’ for PA6 ﬁlm
hydrolysis was particularly surprising, as NylB is 200 times more active
for 6-AHA dimer hydrolysis than NylB’
39. With 6-AHA monomer being
the sole product under all conditions, it may be that NylB’-SCY is acting
in exo-type manner, cleaving terminal monomer moieties from the
PA6 ﬁlm surface, or that the hydrolysis of released longer oligomers is
too fast to observe. In either case, the release of a homogenous reac-
tion product may be desirable for downstream applications

The rationally mutated NylCK-TS variant exhibited the highest
extents of depolymerization, indicating that thermostability is indeed
a useful feature for PA6 deconstruction. Introduction of just two
mutations led to an increase inTm of 16.4 °C (NylCK-TS, Tm =8 7 . 1° C ) ,
indicating that the enzyme is highly engineerable. NylCK-TS proved
very stable, being active in reactions up to 80 °C, and retaining activity
after even seven days of reaction at 60 °C, and it also required the
lowest enzyme loadings to achieve the highest levels of PA6 depoly-
merization (0.1µM NylC
K-TS, 8 µM enzyme/g PA6, equivalent to
0.58 mg enzyme/g PA6), both desirable characteristics of an industrial
biocatalyst. Our analyses indicate that NylC
K-TS appears to cleave the
polymer in a non-speciﬁc manner, with a mixture of soluble oligomers
initially released before further hydrolysis, likely through a non-
processive mechanism of action. Drawing parallels with PET hydro-
lysis, it may be that enzymatic PA6 deconstruction proceeds via a
combination of endo- and exo-lytic bond cleavages

single 6-AHA monomer product. Future enzyme-substrate modeling
and structural studies may help further explain the differences in
activities of the NylB-type and NylC-type enzymes and shed additional
light on their mode of action. It is most likely that NylC
K-TS, along with
the other enzymes studied, currently deconstructs only a small
amount of easily accessible polymer, being unable to progress further
once this has been removed, suggesting that a polymer pretreatment
step to encourage further depolymerization may be necessary. Our
experiments additionally suggest that NylC
K-TS activity may be sub-
stantially affected by non-productive binding events, indicating that
this may be an important area for further investigation when con-
sidering future enzyme engineering attempts. However, although the

presence of even a small amount of activity in a very stable scaffold
provides an important stepping stone from which more active PA6
deconstructing biocatalysts can be realized, as has been demonstrated
by the number of successful PETase engineering campaigns following
the discovery of numerous PET-active esterases
21,58,72,99,100.
Overall, our analyses indicate that there is signiﬁcant work ahead
to progress enzymatic nylon depolymerization. Of the candidates
tested, NylC-type and NylB-type enzymes appeared to be the most
speciﬁc and active, placing them as the scaffolds with the most
potential for enzyme engineering, as has witnessed signiﬁcant success
in the PETaseﬁeld
21,58,101. In particular, the NylCK-TS variant developed
here may be of particular interest, being both highly thermotolerant
and stable over long reaction times. Key characteristics to be targeted
for nylonase enhancement, include increasing thermostability and
catalytic activity, reduction in non-speciﬁc binding, and improving
product release speciﬁcity. However, given the limited depolymeriza-
tion extents observed, it is likely that development of substrate pre-
processing methods or in situ approaches for improving enzyme
access during the reaction will be necessary to access higher extents of
depolymerization
102. It will be important to assess such processes with
techno-economic analysis and life cycle assessment to conﬁrm their
viability for at-scale beneﬁcial economics and reduced environmental
impacts103,104. Our study also highlights the need for a more diverse set
of starting enzymes for potential nylonase engineering campaigns as,
unlike the PETaseﬁeld, there are few obvious candidates from the
currently available literature. Bioprospecting, metagenomic screening,
and computational enzyme discovery methods may all offer avenues
to different biocatalysts with more suitable PA6 deconstruction
characteristics
23,57,105,106. Such methods, however, should be under-
pinned by rigorous characterization of enzyme activity on solid PA6,
with the LC-MS/MS analysis developed here offering a comprehensive
method of assessment for soluble products. In addition, the analytics
showcased here could also be expanded to include the deconstruction
products of alternative nylon formulations, such as PA6,6, to expand
the repertoire of PA-depolymerizing enzymes even further. We are
hopeful that the insight offered by our analyses highlight some of the
challenges to be overcome and necessary improvements needed to
create a viable PA6 biocatalytic recycling strategy.
Methods
Materials
PA6 ﬁlm (0.2 mm thickness, 13.2% crystallinity by DSC, full material
characterization available in Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary
Fig. 3, product ID: AM30-FM-000200), PA6 powder (particle size:
5–50 µm, 47.6% crystallinity by DSC, full material characterization
available in Supplementary Table 3, product ID: AM306010), and PA6
thick ﬁlm (0.5 mm thickness, full material characterization available in
Supplementary Table 3, product ID: AM301400), were sourced from
Goodfellow. As a note, we found small differences between batches of
PA6 ﬁlm sourced from Goodfellow (Supplementary Table 4). Crystal-
line PA6ﬁlm (0.2 mm thick, 23.0% crystallinity by DSC, full material
characterization available in Supplementary Table 1, Supplementary
Fig. 26) was prepared by cutting up Goodfellow PA6ﬁlm into smaller
pieces and drying at 150 °C in a vacuum oven overnight. The pieces
were hot pressed between Teﬂon sheets at 250 °C for 1 min at
1,000 psia. The Teﬂon/nylon ﬁlm assembly was then placed on a pre-
heated hot plate at 200 °C under a pre-heated steel block for 10 min.
Finally, theﬁlm was dried in a vacuum oven at 200 °C for 2 h. Prior to
use, Goodfellow PA6 ﬁlm and crystalline PA6 ﬁlm were cut into
0.5 cm×0.5 cm squares, and Goodfellow thickﬁlm was cut into 0.32
×0.32 cm squares. Theﬁlm squares were then washed in DI water for
3 h at 37 °C, rinsed in DI water once and then dried.
All reagents, chemicals and buffer components were sourced
from Sigma-Aldrich, unless speciﬁed otherwise. HiC was purchased
from Novozymes (Novozym® 51032), subtilisin A, trypsin, papain, and
bovine serum albumin (BSA) from Sigma-Aldrich, andα-chymotrypsin
from Worthington Biochemical, USA. Butyric anhydride was sourced
from TCI chemicals and 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexaﬂuoroisopropanol from Chem
IMPEX. The chemical synthesis of N-(4-nitrophenyl)butanamide
(N4NB) is detailed in Supplementary Fig. 30 and the corresponding
1H
NMR spectrum can be found in Supplementary Fig. 31 (analyzed using
MNova (Mestrelab Research, version 14.0.0))
107.
Enzyme identiﬁcation and homology searches
Literature searches were conducted toﬁnd enzymes with observed
activity on solid PA6, PA6,6, PA6 oligomers, polyurethane (PUR), or
poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), considering both scientiﬁcr e p o r t s
and patents, with the enzyme names, sources, groups, and reasons for
selection detailed in Supplementary Data 1. Amino acid sequences for
the selected proteins were taken directly from these reports (Supple-
mentary Data 2). As RoL-WT could not be expressed inE. coli,ap r e -
viously described mutant which had previous successful E. coli
expression (RoL10X) was used
108. The Ser-His-Asp (SHD) hydrolase
group of enzymes was selected from our in-house PET hydrolase
library, including two previously reported thermostabilized variants,
LCC-ICCG and HotPETase
21,58. Homology searches for additional NylC-
type enzymes and amidases were carried out using UniProt BLAST66,
with NylCp2 and NfPolyA as the input protein sequences. The sug-
gested parameters for UniProt BLAST were used (database: UniProtKB,
E-threshold: 10, Matrix: Auto-BLOSUM62, Hits: 250), with a homology
cut-off of ~50%. From the output sequence homology lists, several
candidates were selected that came from potentially thermophilic
microorganisms. The phylogenetic tree was inferred by using the
Maximum Likelihood method and JTT matrix-based mode, with 1,000
bootstraps
109. The tree with the highest log likelihood (−4629.08) is
shown. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained auto-
matically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix
of pairwise distances estimated using the JTT model, and then select-
ing the topology with superior log likelihood value. All positions with
less than 90% site coverage were eliminated, i.e., fewer than 10%
alignment gaps, missing data, and ambiguous bases were allowed at
any position (partial deletion option). There was a total of 88 positions
in the ﬁnal dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA
X
110,111. The phylogenetic tree was visualized using the Interactive Tree
of Life (iTOL) online tool112.
Rational mutagenesis of NylCs and NylB
Rational mutations for increasing the thermostability of NylCA and
NylCK were selected based on positions identiﬁed by rational muta-
genesis of NylCp2 for thermostability by Negoro et al.49.T h eN e g o r o
4-point mutant, NylCp2-TS, (NylCp2-D36A/D122G/H130Y,/E263Q) has
an increasedTm of 86.5 °C (30 °C increase over the WT, Supplementary
Fig. 1). As Negoro et al. found that mutating G111 and L137 of NylCp2 to
the analogous residues in NylCK and NylCA (S111 and A137) signiﬁcantly
decreased thermostability, we hypothesized that the G111 and L137
from NylC
p2 may be a more stable conﬁguration of these residues, and

hence we introduced them into the scaffolds of NylCK and NylCA.I n
addition, the E263Q mutation was included in NylCA as this change
additionally increased the thermostability of NylCp2 in the context of
D122 and H130, which NylCA already possesses. This gave the ther-
mostabilized variants NylCK-TS (NylCK-S111G/A137L) and NylCA-TS
(NylCK-S111G/A137L/E263Q). The NylB mutation was informed by pre-
vious work on the NylB homolog, NylB′39. A three point mutant, NylB’-
SCY (NylB’ R187S/F264C/D370Y), had enhanced 6-AHA dimer hydro-
lysis ability as compared to the wild-type NylB’ enzyme, hence, S187/
C264/Y370 were introduced at the analogous positions in NylB to give
NylB-SCY. The amino acid sequences for all mutants are presented in
Supplementary Data 2.
Plasmid construction
All protein-encoding genes were codon optimized for expression inE.
coli, and inserted into either pET-21b, pET-28a or pET-29b expression
vectors between NdeI (5′ end) and XhoI (3′ end) restriction sites,
dependent on the enzyme, as detailed in Supplementary Data 2. All
vectors contain a hexa-histidine tag coding sequence for downstream
protein puriﬁcation. Plasmids were initially synthesized by Twist
Biosciences. In-house preparations of the plasmids used in this
studyhave been deposited at AddGene [https://www.addgene.org/
Gregg_Beckham/].
Enzyme expression
All enzymes were expressed in chemically competent BL21 (DE3)E. coli
cells. Single colonies of freshly transformed cells were grown at 37 °C
overnight in 5 mL of LB medium supplemented with the appropriate
antibiotic for the expression vector (100µg/mL ampicillin or 25µg/mL
kanamycin). 2 mL of the resulting culture was used to inoculate 50-
100 mL of 2YT medium containing either 100µg/mL ampicillin or
25 µg/mL kanamycin, as appropriate. Cultures were grown at 37 °C,
190 rpm, to an OD
600 of 1. Protein production was initiated by the
addition of IPTG (ﬁnal concentration of 0.1 mM), and cultures grown
for a further 20 h at 20 °C. Cells were collected by centrifugation at
3,220 ×g f o r1 0m i na n ds t o r e da t−20 °C until puriﬁcation.
Enzyme puriﬁcation
Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (pH 7.5, 50 mM Tris-HCl,
10 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl, 1.0 mg/mL lysozyme, 10µg/mL
DNase) and subjected to sonication. The resulting lysate was clariﬁed
by centrifugation (13,500 ×g for 15 min) and the soluble fraction
applied to Ni-Nta agarose (Anatrace). Unbound proteins were removed
with lysis buffer, followed by elution of bound proteins with elution
buffer (pH 7.5, 50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM imidazole, 300 mM NaCl).
Proteins were the applied to 10DG desalting columns (Bio-Rad) and
eluted in reaction buffer (100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (NaPi), pH
7.5, 150 mM NaCl). Protein purity was conﬁrmed by SDS-PAGE, with
concentrations determined by 280 nm absorbance readings, assuming
extinction coefﬁcients detailed in Supplementary Data 2. Protein yields
for enzyme puriﬁcation from a 100 mLE. coliculture are detailed in
Supplementary Data 1.
Enzyme thermostability analysis
The thermostabilities of the NylC-TS variants were determined using
differential scanning ﬂuorimetry (DSF). For each protein, a 5µM
sample of protein was prepared in reaction buffer and SYPRO Orange
dye (provided at a 5000X concentration from the manufacturer),
added to aﬁnal concentration of 10X. DSF was carried out using a
Bio-Rad CFX Connect 96-Real Time PCR system, using the FRET
channel for excitation and emission settings, and CFX Manager
(version 2.0) for data collection. The temperature was increased with
an increment of 0.3 °C/s from 25 °C to 95 °C. TheT
m was then
determined from the peak of theﬁrst derivative of the melt curve
from three replicate measurements.
Screening for activity on N4NB
Activity screens onN-(4-nitrophenyl)butanamide (N4NB) were con-
ducted as follows: a reaction mixture of 500µM N4NB in reaction
buffer (100 mM NaPi, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) was arrayed in a 96-well
plate. To initiate the reaction, 2µM of each enzyme was added, the
plate sealed with optically clearﬁlm, and the release ofp-nitroaniline
(pNA) followed by change in absorbance at 410 nm monitored using a
Biotek Synergy HT plate reader over the course of 24 h at 30 °C. The
concentration ofpNA was determined by constructing a calibration
curve. Enzyme reactions were carried out in triplicate.
Quantitation of soluble PA6 oligomers by UHPLC-MS/MS oper-
ating in dynamic multiple reaction monitoring mode (dMRM)
An analysis method was developedfor the quantitation of products
from enzymatic deconstruction of PA6 utilizing ultra-high pressure
liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS).
This method employs reverse phase chromatography and dynamic
multiple reaction monitoring (dMRM) in positive ion mode using
electrospray ionization (ESI) (published on protocols.io, Method 1:
[https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.kxygx331dg8j/v1], Method 2:

dards were sourced commercially from Sigma Aldrich, Advanced
ChemBlocks, and Toronto Research Chemicals. Commercial standards
could not be sourced or readily synthesized for 6-AHA tetramer, 6-AHA
pentamer, and 6-AHA cyclic-trimer but were still monitored for and
quantiﬁed from similarly structured compounds, as detailed below. By
weight, individual stock standards of all available analytes were pre-
pared at a concentration of 2000µg/mL using ultrapure water as a
diluent. The stock solutions were combined and diluted with ultrapure
water to aﬁnal concentration of 10µg/mL. From this mixed standard
working solution, a ten-point calibration curve with a quantitation
range of 0.01 to 7.0µg/mL was prepared. A calibration veriﬁcation
standard (CVS) was made at a concentration of 1.0µg/mL. To check
that the linear PA6 oligomers were stable in incubated, buffered
solutions, 10μg/mL of 6-AHA, 6-AHA dimer and 6-AHA trimer chemical
standards were incubated individually in reaction buffer (100 mM NaPi
buffer, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) at 40-80 °C for 10 days, with samples
quenched in MeOH (1 volume sample: 4 volumes methanol), as for
enzyme containing reactions. There was no measurable turnover of
any of the standards to alternative products, indicating that any
changes in linear oligomer concentrations during reactions can be
attributed to enzyme action (Supplementary Table 2). Cyclic oligomers
can also be considered stable in incubated buffered solutions, as
demonstrated in Supplementary Fig. 5B.
Sample and standards were analyzed using an Agilent 1290 series
UHPLC system coupled to an Agilent 6470 triple quadrupole mass
spectrometer. Ionization was achieved using the Agilent Jet Stream
electrospray source operated in positive ionization mode. Optimiza-
tion of the dMRM transitions for all compounds was executed prior to
analysis using authentic standards when available. An enzymatically
degraded PA6 sample was used to optimize for the compounds of
interest that could not be commercially sourced. Conﬁrmation of the
presence of these analytes was performed using high resolution mass
spectrometry ESI (HR-MS-ESI). This optimization determined the
quantifying and qualifying transitions along with corresponding colli-
sion energies and fragmentor voltages (Supplementary Table 5). Data
acquisition was conducted using Mass Hunter Data Acquisition soft-
ware (Agilent, version 10.1).
Initial samples were analyzed with a seven-minute analyte elution
protocol (Method 1, analysis method used for data presented in Sup-
plementary Figs. 10, 11, and 13)
113. Method 1 consisted of sample and
standards injected at a volume of 0.5µL onto a Phenomenex Kinetex
2.1 mm×100 mm, 1.7µm C18 column held at constant temperature of
40 °C. Chromatography was achieved using mobile phases comprised
of (A) 0.1% formic acid in ultrapure water and (B) 0.1% formic acid in

ditions att = 6 min and holding for 1 minute for a total run time of
7 min. Method 1 was subsequently optimized for a faster run-time of
three minutes to give method 2 (analysis method used for all other
data presented)83. Method 2 employed an injection volume of 0.5µL
onto an Agilent Zorbax Eclipse Plus C18 Rapid Resolution HD column
(2.1 ×50 mm, 1.8µm) held at 40 °C. The same mobile phases were
utilized as in method 1 for the following gradient:t =0m i n( A )=9 9 %
and (B) = 1%;t =0 . 5m i n ( A )=9 9 % a n d ( B )=1 % ;t = 0.51 min (A) = 80%

conditions at t = 2.01 minutes and holding for a total run time of
3 minutes. The ESI source parameters for both conditions were iden-
tical and optimized as follows; capillary voltage 3 kV, nozzle voltage
0 kV, drying gas temperature 300 °C, drying gasﬂow 7 L/min, sheath
gas temperature 350 °C, sheath gasﬂow 11 L/min, and lastly the ESI
nebulizer pressure was set to 35 psi. Analysis was executed using Mass
Hunter Quantitative Analysis for QQQ (Agilent, version 10.1). All cali-
bration curves had an r
2 coefﬁcient of≥ 0.995 with a quadratic curveﬁt.
Quantitation for 6-AHA tetramer and pentamer was performed using
the calibration curve from 6-AHA trimer, and 6-AHA cyclic-trimer used
the calibration curve from 6-AHA cyclic-dimer. A CVS was injected at
least every 20 samples to monitor for instrument drift. An acceptable
CVS recovery was determined to be ± 15% of expected concentration.
Samples were prepared by a dilution in methanol at a minimum dilu-
tion factor ofﬁve to facilitate precipitation of buffer salts, to reduce
ion suppression and interferences in the source.
Screening for enzyme activity on PA6ﬁlm
The initial activity screens on PA6ﬁlms for all enzymes were carried
out as followed: reactions contained two squares of PA6ﬁlm (13.19 mg
± 0.13 mg PA6, calculated by weighing six pairs of squares and taking
the average mass) in reaction buffer (100 mM NaPi buffer, pH 7.5,
150 mM NaCl). 2µM of enzyme was added to initiate the reaction,
giving an enzyme substrate loading of 0.15 mM enzyme/g PA6ﬁlm and
a substrate loading of 0.65 wt%. Reactions were carried out in triplicate
at 40, 50, 60, and 70 °C over the course of 10 days at 180 rpm, with
samples taken at 24, 72, 168, and 240 hs. For the comparison of NylC
K
and NylCK-TS reactions were caried out with 1µMe n z y m ea n d1 3 m g
PA6 and incubated at 40–80 °C (0.08 mM enzyme/g PA6, 0.65 wt%
substrate loading) with additional time-points taken in the early phase
of the reaction. For the characterization of the best performing
enzymes, reactions were conducted at 50 °C for NylB’-SCY and 60 °C
for Tt-NylC and NylC
K-TS to maximize reaction yield while avoiding
potentially confounding effects of thermally induced PA6 crystal-
lization observed at higher temperatures. Reactions with variable
enzyme or substrate loadings were also carried out in an analogous
manner to the initial activity screens with the following changes: for
variable enzyme loadings, enzyme concentration was varied from
0.005µMu pt o1 0µM per reaction using two squares of PA6ﬁlm as the
substrate (13 mg), while for changing substrate loadings, 1µMo f
enzyme was applied to one toﬁve squares of PA6ﬁlm per reaction. For
reactions with changing pHs, all buffers were made to 100 mM and
supplemented with 150 mM NaCl, using citrate buffer at pH6, NaPi
buffer at pH 7-8 and glycine-OH buffer from pH 9-10, and each reaction
contained 1µM of enzyme and two squares of PA6, equating to aﬁnal
reaction composition of 0.08 mM enzyme/g PA6ﬁlm and a substrate
loading of 0.65 wt%. Immediately following sampling, all time point
samples were quenched in MeOH (1 volume sample: 4 volumes
methanol) to denature any active enzyme,ﬁltered using a 0.22μM
PVDF ﬁlter plate to remove any solids, and stored at 4 °C prior to
analysis. The extent of PA6ﬁlm depolymerization by mass was calcu-
lated from the release of soluble PA6 depolymerization products as
determined by LC-MS/MS.
For the crude cell lysate-based assay, a 50 mL NylC
K-TS expressing
E. colicell culture wasﬁrst prepared as above. Following sonication of
the resulting cell pellet in lysis buffer, the lysate was clariﬁed by
incubation at 60 °C for 30 mins prior to centrifugation. The crude cell
lysate was compared to puriﬁed NylCK-TS by SDS-PAGE (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 6). PA6 deconstruction reactions were then carried out in an
analogous manner to those containing puriﬁed protein, using 100μL
of the crude cell lysate preparation as the biocatalytic agent.
Activity assays with nylon oligomers
Activity assays with 6-AHA dimer, 6-AHA trimer and 6-AHA cyclic-
dimer were carried out as follows: 50µMo f6 - A H At r i m e r ,1 0 0µM
6-AHA dimer or 100µM 6-AHA cyclic-dimer were placed in reaction
buffer, pH 7.5 NaPi, 150 mM NaCl. Reactions were initiated by addition
of 2µM enzyme and incubated at the optimal reaction temperature of
the described enzyme. Reactions were monitored over the course of
24 h. No enzyme controls showed no detectable hydrolysis of either
6-AHA trimer, 6-AHA dimer or 6-AHA cyclic-dimer over 24 h at reaction
conditions.
Characterization of NylCK-TS activity
For additional characterization of NylCK-TS activity, reactions con-
tained 1µM enzyme and two squares of PA6ﬁlm in reaction buffer and
were incubated at 60 °C unless otherwise stated, giving aﬁnal reaction
composition of 0.08 mM enzyme/g PA6ﬁlm and a substrate loading of
0.65 wt%. Crystalline and thickﬁlm PA6 reactions were carried out in
the same manner using the same mass of the alternativeﬁlms as the
reaction substrates (13 mg, 2 squares of 0.5 cm×0.5 cm and 2 squares
of 0.32 cm×0.32 cm, for the crystallineﬁlm and thick ﬁlm, respec-
tively). For reactions with pre-incubated substrate, two PA6ﬁlm
squares were incubated in reaction buffer for either three or seven
days, prior to addition of 1µM enzyme. For reactions with fresh
enzyme added, a NylC
K-TS activity assay was carried out for either
three or seven days with a time-point sample taken for analysis at the
end of reaction, the PA6 squares were removed, sonicated in DI water,
rinsed and placed in fresh reaction buffer, 1µMo ff r e s he n z y m ew a s
then added and the reaction allowed to progress with additional pro-
duct formed added to the value of the time-point sample taken at the
end of theﬁrst reaction. For reactions with fresh PA6 substrate added,
a NylC
K-TS activity assay was carried out for either three or seven days
with a sample taken for analysis of T0, two new squares of PA6 were
then added to the same reaction and reaction progress monitored
further. For reactions with bovine serum albumin (BSA), reactions
contained 0.01µMN y l C
K-TS, two squares of PA6ﬁlm (0.8µMe n z y m e /
gP A 6ﬁlm and a substrate loading of 0.65 wt%) and 0.5 to 2 mM BSA.
PA6 substrate characterization
PA6 substrates were prepared as follows: in their unmodiﬁed state, as
obtained from the manufacturer, or as prepared in-house; washed
state, following washing in DI water prior to reactions; or their incu-
bated state where PA6 substrates were incubated in reaction buffer
under the same conditions as an enzymatic assay from 40-70 °C
(Supplementary Fig. 3). Substrates were also assessed after enzyme
reactions, following incubation with 1µM NylC
K-TS at 60 °C for 10 days.
Prior to analysis, other than the unmodiﬁed substrates, all samples
were rinsed in DI water to remove salts and enzymes. All substrates
were then dried for 4 h at 50 °C to remove residual water. The thermal
stability of nylon samples was assessed by thermogravimetric analysis
(TGA) using a Discovery TGA 5500 (TA Instruments). For each run, 6-
10 mg of polymer sample was placed in a platinum TGA pan. Samples

temperature of the derivative maximum were determined for each
mass loss event.
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to measure the
thermal properties and crystallinity of unmodiﬁed and treated nylons.
Samples were dried at 40 °C for 24 h in a vacuum oven to remove
absorbed water immediately prior to analysis60.D S Cm e a s u r e m e n t s
were performed on a Discovery X3 Differential Scanning Calorimeter
(TA Instruments) using 4-8 mg of sample in hermetically sealed alu-
minum pans (DSC Consumables). Each DSC run consisted of two
heating and cooling cycles between 0 °C and 290 °C at a rate of 10 °C/
min with 5 min isothermal holds between each heating and cooling
ramp. The glass transition temperature (T
g), melting temperature (Tm),
enthalpy of melting (ΔHm), crystallization temperature (Tc), tempera-
ture of cold crystallization (Tc), and enthalpy of cold crystallization
(ΔHc) for each sample was determined when applicable with TRIOS
software (Universal Analysis, v5.4.0.300). Integration bounds and
baselines were determined following the procedure described by
Khanna and Kuhn
60. The following equation was used to calculate
percent crystallinity, whereΔHm°, the reference enthalpy of melting, is
230.1 J/g for nylon-6114.

Gel permeation chromatography (GPC) with multi-angle light
scattering (MALS) and differential refractive index (dRI) detectors
was used to measure the weight average molar mass (M
w), number
average molar mass (Mn), and molar mass dispersity (Đ) values of
PA6 samples. Samples were dissolved in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexa-
ﬂuoroisopropanol (HFIP) with 20 mM of sodium triﬂuoroacetate
(NaTFAc) at a concentration of ~ 5 mg/mL, thenﬁltered through
0.2 µm PTFE syringeﬁlters (Agilent). GPC was conducted using a 1260
Inﬁnity II LC system (Agilent), three PL HFIPgel 250 × 4.6 mm col-
umns, and a matching guard column (Agilent). HFIP supplemented
with 20 mM NaTFAc was used as the mobile phase at aﬂow rate of
0.35 mL/min. Due to HFIP’s viscosity, the HPLC column oven was
heated to 40 °C to decrease column backpressure. An Optilab T-Rex
refractive index detector (Wyatt Technology) and miniDawn TREOS
MALS detector (Wyatt Technology) were attached in line.M
n,M w,
and Đ were calculated with ASTRA (Wyatt Technologies, version
8.2.0), using 0.2375 as thedn/dc of PA6 in HFIP (Wyatt Technologies
Database ofdn/dc values).
SEM analysis
SEM analysis was carried out on PA6ﬁlms incubated with or without
1 µMN y l CK-TS at 60 °C for 10 days. Samples were analyzed by scanning
electron microscopy (SEM) on a Hitachi S-4800 High Resolution
scanning electron microscope in low- and high-magniﬁcation modes at
electron voltage = 10 kV, current = ~7 amps, and working distance =
4 mm. Prior to imaging, the samples were coated with a thin layer
(10 nm) of Ir using a Cressington plasma sputter-coater (208-HR)
under inert (Ar) atmosphere and mounted on an aluminum stage with
double-sided C and Cu tapes. Image processing was conducted via
publicly available software ImageJ2 (NIH).
Data visualization
Graphs within the main manuscript and Supplementary Information
were created using Microsoft Excel (version 16.80), molecules were
drawn using ChemDraw 20.1, and protein structures were visualized
using USCF Chimera (version 1.10.1).
