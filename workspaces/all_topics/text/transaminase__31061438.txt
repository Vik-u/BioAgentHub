transaminases catalyze the reversible transfer reaction of an amino group between a primary amine 
and an α-keto acid, utilizing pyridoxal 5′-phosphate as a cofactor. ω-transaminases (ωtAs) recognize an 
amino group linked to a non-α carbon of amine substrates. Recently, a novel (S)-enantioselective ωtA 
from Thermomicrobium roseum (tr-ωTA) was identified and its enzymatic activity reported. However, 
the detailed mechanism of (S)-enantioselective substrate recognition remained unclear. In this study, 
we determined the crystal structure of tr-ωTA at 1.8 Å resolution to elucidate the mechanism underlying 
tr-ωtA substrate (S)-enantioselectivity. A structural analysis of tr-ωtA along with molecular docking 
simulations revealed that two pockets at the active site tightly restrict the size and orientation of 
functional groups of substrate candidates. Based on the structural information and docking simulation 
results, we propose a comprehensive catalytic mechanism of tr-ωtA. the present study thus provides 
structural and functional insights into the (S)-enantioselectivity of tr-ωtA.
Transaminases reversibly catalyze the transfer reaction of an amino group from an amine donor to a carbonyl 
acceptor, mediated by pyridoxal 5′ -phosphate (PLP) as a cofactor. These enzymes are classified by diverse cri-
teria including fold type (I and IV), sequence pattern (I–IV), and amino group position of the donor substrate 
(α, β, γ, and ω)
1,2. α-, β-, and γ-transaminases recognize substrates containing an amino group bound to α , β, 
and γ carbon atoms, respectively2. ω-transaminases (ωTAs), in contrast, constitute the comprehensive enzymes 
that transfer an amino group bound to a non-α  carbon of amine substrates 1,2. ωTAs have gained considerable 
attention owing to their enantioselectivity, which is considered as a key property in the field of pharmaceutical 
chemistry and the fine chemical industry 3–5. Industrial applications of ω TAs have been attained through both 
kinetic resolution and asymmetric synthesis. For kinetic resolution, undesired enantiomers comprising half of the 
produced racemic compounds are converted to ketone products, leaving the remaining, preferred enantiomers in 
their native form
3. For asymmetric synthesis, preferred ketone compounds accept an amino group, yielding the 
desired chiral amines3.
This unique enzymatic property of ωTAs has led to active structural studies regarding the enantioselectivity 
of ωTAs. The active site geometry formed with PLP has been considered as a determinant factor for the enanti-
oselectivity6–8. The amino group transfer accompanying PLP comprises two consecutive half reactions6,7, with the 
first being the oxidative deamination process of a primary amine. The second half reaction, in contrast, proceeds 
via the reductive amination process of a ketone compound. PLP is involved in both reactions as a mediator of 
the amino group. The amination reaction is initiated by substituting the amino group from an amine donor 
for the ε-amino group of a Lys residue covalently bound to the C4′  atom on PLP , resulting in the formation of

pyridoxamine-5′-phosphate (PMP). The amino group of PMP is transferred to a ketone compound as an amino 
group acceptor via the second half reaction. In both reactions, PLP/PMP is located in the PLP/PMP binding site 
through coordination with adjacent residues. The spatial position of PLP primarily determines the enantiose-
lectivity peculiar to each ω TA by favorably orienting toward the substrate entry direction between the Re - and 
Si-faces
9. Previous structural studies have revealed that ω TAs have two pockets (the P- and O-pockets) in the 
active site 2,5,10. The P-pocket is located near the phosphate group of PLP , whereas the O-pocket is positioned 
in the proximity of the O3′  atom on PLP . The two pockets differ from each other in size, depending on the 
class of ωTAs5,8. The resulting volumetric difference renders the substrate recognition more stringent regarding 
enantioselectivity5,8,10.
ωTAs belonging to fold type I and class III exhibit (S)-enantioselectivity2. Several (S)-enantioselective ωTAs 
have been identified on the basis of sequence and biochemical analyses 11–19 along with structural studies10,20–23. 
An (S)- enantioselective ωTA from Vibrio fluvialis (Vf-ωTA) has also been engineered by incorporating unnatural 
amino acids, thereby improving its thermostability and resistance to organic solvents24. Recently, the structures of 
Vf-ωTA were determined with its apo25 and holo26 forms. Based on the sequence information of Vf-ωTA, a novel 
thermostable (S)-specific transaminase from Thermomicrobium roseum (Tr-ωTA) was also identified that exhib-
its diverse substrate specificity and thermostability 27. This previous study revealed that Tr- ωTA demonstrates 
(S)-enantioselectivity and different enzymatic activities according to the size and physicochemical properties of 
its functional groups27.
However, the molecular mechanism through which Tr-ωTA possesses (S)-enantioselective substrate specific-
ity is not fully understood. It also remains elusive how Tr-ωTA can recognize diverse substrates as an amino group 
donor. Moreover, although many ωTAs exploit pyruvate as an amino group acceptor, little is known regarding 
the spatial position and interaction at the active site during catalysis. These issues require detailed explanations 
at the molecular level. Thus, it is necessary to elucidate the structure of Tr-ωTA and the mechanism of binding to 
its substrates.
Herein, we report the crystal structure of Tr-ωTA at 1.8 Å resolution to clarify the substrate recognition mech-
anism of (S)-enantioselective Tr-ωTA. Along with structural analyses, molecular docking simulations were per-
formed with various substrate candidates. The structural analysis revealed that two pockets at the active site of 
Tr-ωTA are formed with evolutionarily conserved residues. The docking simulations suggested that key residues 
at the active site are spatially arranged to recognize the functional groups of each substrate compound. Our 
results, thus, provide structural insight into the substrate recognition mechanism of (S)-enantioselective Tr-ωTA.
Results and Discussion
overall structure of tr-ωtA. The structure of Tr-ωTA was determined in the PMP-bound form at 1.8  Å 
resolution. Data collection and refinement statistics for Tr- ωTA are presented in Table 1. The overall structure 
constitutes a homodimer, with each subunit comprising a large and a small domain (Fig.  1). The large domain 
(residues 94–315) contains a PMP cofactor and consists of eleven helices and seven strands, adopting an α-β-α 
sandwich fold (Fig. 1b,c). The central β-strands form a twisted β-sheet, in which six strands, except the β11 strand, 
run parallel to each other (Fig. 1b,c). Two of the eleven helices comprise 310-helices, of which the η3 helix contains 
the Lys289 residue involved in the catalytic reaction. The small domain can be divided into two lobes (N- and 
C-terminal lobes), which contain the corresponding terminal regions (Fig.  1b,c). The N-terminal lobe is com-
prised of an antiparallel β-sheet and four helices. Notably, the β-sheet is flanked by the C-terminal lobe and the α4 
helix runs perpendicular across the β-sheet. The region between α4 and α5 interacts with the other subunit, play-
ing a crucial role in forming the active site of the one subunit. The C-terminal lobe also contains an antiparallel 
β-sheet formed by four strands. A notable feature of the C-terminal lobe is that the α14 helix and a relatively long 
linker connected to the large domain are located away from the rest of the cluster of the C-terminal lobe (Fig. 1b), 
with the linker being responsible for forming the PLP-binding site in the other subunit.
The crystal structure of Tr-ωTA revealed that Tr-ωTA exists as a homodimer in the asymmetric unit. A pleth-
ora of residues are involved in interactions between each subunit (Fig.  2a,b). Several structured loops from the 
two subunits interact with each other at the interface, forming a tight loop insertion between the two subu-
nits (Fig. 2c). These interactions indicated that Tr-ω TA is stable as a dimer form owing to the strong binding. 
A size exclusion chromatography-coupled multiangle light scattering (SEC-MALS) analysis also showed that 
a peak appeared at 15 ml retention volume, which indicated that Tr-ωTA exists as a dimer in solution (Fig. 2d). 
Moreover, a multimeric prediction using the PDBePISA server
28 suggested that the most probable multimeric 
state of Tr-ωTA is a dimer in solution. These results coincided with the dimer form revealed by the crystal struc-
ture, strongly implying that Tr-ωTA carries out its biological function as a dimer.
Incorporating a cofactor into the active site has been shown to have an effect on conformational changes in 
partial regions of Vf-ωTA25. In our structure, PMP was observed only in subunit B. This finding raised the pos-
sibility that conformational differences might exist between the two subunits of Tr-ωTA. Accordingly, to investi-
gate potential structural differences between the two subunits that form the dimer, their overall structures were 
compared (Supplementary Fig. S1). A structural superimposition analysis showed that the root-mean-square 
deviation (RMSD) value for 440 Cα  atoms of each subunit was 0.71 Å. This RMSD value signified that the two 
subunits of Tr-ωTA are structurally almost identical to each other. As a result, although the PMP molecules were 
discriminatorily distributed between the subunits in the crystal, this did not cause any structural differences in 
the dimer form. It was thus inferred that the strong interactions between the two subunits could offset the struc-
tural dynamics induced by the absence of PMP .
The surface electrostatic potential of Tr-ωTA was also assessed to investigate the spatial distribution of charged 
residues. Notably, we found that positively charged residues are dominantly distributed on the flat area includ-
ing the entrance to the active site, whereas negatively charged residues are spread out on the peripheral “wall” 
structure surrounding the flat area (Fig. 3). However, the opposite side of the flat area did not exhibit any special 
3Scientific  RepoRts  |          (2019) 9:6958  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-43490-2
www.nature.com/scientificreportswww.nature.com/scientificreports/
features. This finding implied that the electric field generated in the vicinity of the active site may play an essential 
role in inducing the substrates into the active site (as discussed in further detail later in this report).
Active site of tr-ωtA. The active site of ωTAs is located at the interface between two subunits; moreover, 
some residues from one subunit are directly associated with the formation of the active site of the other subunit1,2. 
The entrance to the active site is also positioned near the interface. Another notable structural feature of ωTAs is 
the relatively deep funnel located between the entrance and the PLP-binding site1,2. These distinctive active site 
structural traits are conserved in Tr-ωTA (Fig. 4a,b).
The chemical modification state of PLP is important throughout the catalytic reaction of ωTAs because PLP 
plays an essential role as an amino group mediator 2,6. The amino group transfer mechanism of ω TAs had been 
partially proposed on the basis of previously accumulated findings2. In the “rest period” of the catalysis, the C4′ 
atom of PLP covalently binds to the ε-amino group of an adjacent Lys residue, forming a Schiff base (the internal 
aldimine state). Subsequently, an amino group from a primary amine is substituted for the ε-amino group of the 
Lys residue, followed by the formation of PMP (the Michaelis complex state). In the Michaelis complex, conse-
quently, PMP binds to neither the substrate nor the Lys residue. In this regard, determining whether a cofactor 
molecule in a crystal structure is PLP or PMP is significant because it provides decisive information to infer which 
step the structure corresponds to in the catalytic cycle.
In the crystal structure of Tr-ωTA, the cofactor molecule did not link to either the Lys289 residue or a possible 
substrate, suggesting that the cofactor was PMP (Fig.  4c). To further verify this conclusion, a UV-Visible spec-
trometric analysis of Tr-ωTA was also carried out to obtain the absorption spectrum of the cofactor. A previous 
study demonstrated that the PMP-bound form in a TA from Thermoproteus uzoniensis has an absorption peak at 
approximately 330 nm, whereas the absorption peak in the PLP-bound form appears in the proximity of 420 nm
29. 
As shown in Fig. 4d, Tr-ωTA exhibited an absorption pattern at approximately 330 nm. This spectrometric result 
was in agreement with the PMP-absorption wavelength reported in the previous study 29, confirming that the 
crystal structure of Tr-ωTA constituted the PMP-bound form.
The electron density of PMP is relatively poor as compared with that of K289 (Fig.  4c). Moreover, a series 
of omit maps of PMP at sequential sigma levels showed that the density signal of PMP is weak (Supplementary 
Fig. S2a–c), indicating that PMP exists at a lower molar ratio than the peptide component in the crystal. 
Additionally, to estimate the occupancy value of PMP , PMP-calculated 2FO–FC and FO–FC maps were generated 
with various occupancy values (0.83–0.25). We found that the PMP-calculated FO–FC map shows the least elec-
tron density as both positive and negative maps at the 3 sigma level along with the clear 2FO–FC map, when the 
occupancy value is set to 0.75 (Supplementary Fig. S2d,e). Consequently, the occupancy value of PMP in our

structure is assumed to be approximately 0.75. As PMP is present only in subunit B in the crystal structure, our 
crystal therefore likely constituted a mixture of the apo and holo forms of Tr-ω TA. The scarcity of PMP in the 
crystal may result from loss during the purification and crystallization consequent to diffusion of PMP into the 
buffer solutions.
The Tr-ωTA structure also revealed that PMP is chemically linked to neighboring water molecules and resi-
dues (Supplementary Fig. S3). Specifically, the oxygen atoms in the phosphate group of PMP are coordinated to 
adjacent water molecules and residues such as Gly121, Ala122, and Thr323. The nitrogen atom on the PMP ring 
forms a hydrogen bond with Asp260. The hydroxyl group of the PMP also forms a hydrogen bond with a water 
molecule coordinated to Glu227 and Ala232, and the nitrogen atom linked to the C4′ atom binds to a water mole-
cule as well. Overall, the PMP molecule is coordinated to the proximal residues via hydrogen bonds, part of which 
are mediated by water molecules. Accordingly, the hydrogen-bond network serves as a main factor underlying 
PMP coordination in the active site. It was also found that the carbon atoms on PMP form hydrophobic interac-
tions with nearby hydrophobic residues such as Gly156, Val262, Ile263, and Phe322. Notably, Thr323 and Tyr324 
from the other subunit contribute to the stabilization of the PMP position. This finding suggested that the dimer 
formation of Tr-ωTA is therefore indispensable to the catalytic activity.
The differently sized P- and O-pockets that comprise the ωTA active site
2,5,10 are located in the proximity of the 
phosphate and the phenol group of PLP/PMP , respectively, and their relative sizes are dependent on the fold type 
and class of ωTAs5,8. In the case of Tr-ωTA, we found that the P-pocket is larger than the O-pocket (Fig. 4e). This 
implied that a bulkier functional group of (S)-enantioselective substrates would be oriented toward the P-pocket, 
whereas a smaller functional group is assigned to the O-pocket.
structural comparison with Vf-ωtA. The structure of Tr-ωTA was compared with that of Vf-ωTA (PDB 
ID: 4E3Q), which has a high sequence similarity (sequence identity = 41%)27. The structural comparison revealed 
that the two TAs are structurally almost identical to each other, sharing an overall architecture (Fig.  5a). The

RMSD value for the two TAs (each of 440 Cα atoms) was 1.5 Å. The geometries of the active sites containing 
PMP were also in accordance (Fig. 5b), which suggested that Tr-ωTA may exhibit the same catalytic properties 
as Vf-ωTA.
Despite the structural and functional similarities, however, it was reported that Tr-ωTA exhibits an outstand-
ing thermostability as compared with that of Vf-ωTA27. As protein mobility has been highlighted as an important 
factor contributing to temperature tolerance30, we analysed the B-factor distribution of the two TAs. This analysis 
showed that the structure of Vf-ωTA exhibits overall low B-factor values (Fig. 5c). In contrast, the loop covering 
the active site of Tr-ωTA exhibited high B-factor values (Fig. 5d), suggesting that this loop likely manifests intrin-
sic flexibility. This finding implied that the high mobility loop may play a key role in maintaining the structure of 
the active site by alleviating thermal perturbation caused by high temperature.
Molecular docking simulations.  Although the enantioselectivity of Tr-ω TA, a fold type I- and class 
III-ωTA, has been demonstrated27, the molecular mechanism has remained unclear. To obtain structural insight 
into (S)-enantioselective substrate recognition, we performed molecular docking simulations. Energetically 
favorable conformers of several compounds including S and R forms were investigated. Specifically, we selected 
(S)-enantioselective compounds reported as exhibiting relatively low and high activities in the previous study27; 
the (R)-enantiomers of the compounds with high activities were also prepared.
To more accurately run the docking simulations, some residues related to the active site were designated 
as flexible residues. The active site residues of (S )- enantioselective ω TAs have been identified on the basis of 
sequence alignment and docking simulation studies 7. The putative active site residues of Tr-ω TA were also 
revealed by multiple sequence alignment with other ωTAs (Supplementary Fig. S4). For Tr-ωTA, Y154 along with 
L23 and F89 from the other subunit constitute the P-pocket components, whereas W61 and I263 are involved in 
the formation of the O-pocket. Additionally, K289 is assumed to play a crucial role in forming a Schiff base with 
PLP . An arginine residue corresponding to R416 has also been shown to be responsible for substrate binding
31. 
Thus, these seven residues were set as flexible residues for the docking simulations. PMP in the structure was

replaced with PLP in a Schiff base state for accurate docking simulations. The selected compounds were docked 
into the active site of Tr-ωTA under the same conditions.
Each compound and its binding energy are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Notably, as the binding energy 
values of the compounds with the same formula are similar regardless of enantioselectivity, the docking products 
can be assessed only on the basis of their conformations. The four compounds with positive relative activities 
exhibited similar functional group orientations (Fig. 6a–d). Their bulky groups and short groups were oriented 
toward the P-pocket and O-pocket, respectively. In particular, the two fluorine atoms of compound 2 were shown 
to form hydrogen bonds with W61 and Y154 (Fig. 6b). A previous study demonstrated that a 1,3-proton trans-
fer reaction mediated by the ε-amino group of the Lys key residue in the active site is a rate-determining step
32. 
This reaction corresponds to the α-proton removal from an amino group donor (external aldimine) by the Lys 
residue and the subsequent α-proton transfer to the C4′ carbon atom of the cofactor (ketimine), which leads to 
the formation of the Michaelis complex via addition of a water molecule. Accordingly, considering that the spa-
tial accession of the α-proton to the ε-amino group of the Lys residue is important for the general base catalysis, 
the binding modes of the substrate compounds notably for orientation and distance toward the Lys residue are 
assumed to be crucial for catalysis. In conclusion, these binding modes appeared to be appropriate as binding 
poses for substrate binding and catalysis. Moreover, these results coincided with the previous activity profiles for 
each compound
27.
To investigate the substrate suitability of the (R )-enantiomer, the (R)-enantiomer for (S )-compound 2 was 
also prepared and subjected to a docking simulation. As shown in Fig. 6e, the orientations of its two functional 
groups were opposite to those of the (S)-enantiomer. In this binding pose, the amino group was placed away from 
the position of PLP . It also appeared that it was difficult for the small functional group to bind to the O-pocket. In 
addition, (S)-compounds with low relative activities showed inappropriate poses for the pockets and PLP (Fig. 6f–
h). Thus, it was concluded that the binding of two functional groups to the two pockets and the orientation of an 
amino group depended on the size of the functional groups and the enantioselectivity of the compounds.

For class-III ωTAs, pyruvate can function as an amino group acceptor1,2. However, the structural mechanism 
at the molecular level is not fully understood. In the present study, we performed docking simulations of pyruvate 
to obtain structural insight into the transfer of an amino group to pyruvate. PMP was utilized in the structure as 
for the docking simulations. Notably, we found that the carboxylic acid of pyruvate interacts with the guanidino 
group of R416, resulting in the proper orientation of the ketone group toward PMP with a stable pose in the 
hydrophobic active site (Fig. 6i). From the viewpoint of thermodynamics, the entry of pyruvate into the active 
site of Tr-ωTA would cause an entropic decrease. Consequently, this would appear to result in an increase of free 
energy upon pyruvate binding. However, such a seemingly unfavorable phenomenon might be explained by the 
compensation of enthalpy. It is reasonable to assume that a hydrophilic substrate such as pyruvate would be able 
to maintain a thermodynamically stable state by increasing the number of binding points to adjacent residues, 
thereby decreasing enthalpy under thermodynamically unfavorable circumstances such as within the hydropho-
bic active site.
Amino group transfer mechanism of tr-ωtA. Two substrates are necessary for the completion of the 
transamination reaction by TAs using PLP as a cofactor. Notably, both PLP and pyruvate have strong negative 
charges, which supports the likelihood of a mechanism by which the charged molecules are induced into the 
active site of Tr-ωTA. Our surface electrostatic potential analysis revealed that positively charged residues are 
distributed in the proximity of the active site (Fig.  3), thereby generating a potent electric field (Fig.  7). This 
electric field may play a pivotal role in attracting PLP and pyruvate into the active site. In addition, we also found 
that hydrophobic residues are dominantly distributed in the interior as well as at the entrance of the active site 
(Supplementary Fig. S5). The distribution of these hydrophobic residues in the active site may constitute a useful 
strategy for favorably disposing PLP and the substrates in the active site by obstructing inappropriate interactions 
with the charged molecules.

This assumption is supported by a previously published example regarding acetylcholinesterase, wherein this 
enzyme was reported to exhibit a strong electrostatic dipole 33. This study raised the possibility that the electric 
field induces the charged substrate into the active site of acetylcholinesterase and that aromatic residues in the 
active site are associated with the formation of a proper binding site. Another study demonstrated that electro-
static properties near the binding sites of enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, acetylcholinesterase, and bar-
nase are associated with electrostatic steering for the substrate binding
34. This study showed that introduction of 
charged residues near the active site increased enzyme-substrate association rates, implying electrostatic enhance-
ment. The results were reproduced using Brownian dynamics simulations based on the finite-difference linearized 
Poisson-Boltzmann equation. In turn, Tr-ωTA may constitute another example demonstrating the importance of 
an electric field with respect to transporting a substrate into its active site.
TAs including Tr-ωTA exhibit the enzymatic property to sequentially recognize two different substrates at 
the same active site. Accordingly, the transamination reaction of Tr-ωTA comprises two consecutive processes: 
amino group donation and acceptance (Fig. 8). Herein, we propose a comprehensive transamination mechanism 
including these two processes. As the initial step, a nucleophilic attack from the first substrate as an amino group 
donor allows the Lys289 residue to depart from the bound PLP molecule, forming a new Schiff base between 
the substrate and PLP . A straightforward base abstraction of the α -proton by the Lys289 residue causes elec-
tronic rearrangement in the external aldimine step. After the acceptance of a proton from the Lys289 residue, a 
hydrolysis reaction occurs, producing the Michaelis complex and a ketone compound. Then, the second process 
is initiated through the use of pyruvate as an amino group acceptor. Interacting with the R416 residue, pyruvate 
forms a ketimine with PMP . The second proton acceptance from the Lys289 residue occurs along with electron 
rearrangement, resulting in the second external aldimine. Finally, imination is attained between the Lys289 resi-
due and PLP , recovering the initial internal aldimine.
In summary, we determined the crystal structure of Tr-ωTA specific to (S)-enantiomers. Surface electrostatic 
potential analysis revealed that Tr-ωTA likely exploits an electric field to induce its cofactor PLP and substrates 
into the active site. Based on the molecular docking simulations, we concluded that the orientations of the func-
tional groups and amino group at the chiral center of an amino group donor comprise determining factors for 
the (S)-enantioselectivity of Tr-ωTA. In addition, pyruvate as an amino group acceptor was assumed to bind to 
the R416 residue, attaining binding stability at the active site. To more specifically understand the catalytic mech-
anism of Tr-ωTA, it is necessary to elucidate the stepwise intermediate states on the basis of structural informa-
tion. Thus, future work should determine the respective complex structures by crystallizing the substrate-bound 
forms of Tr-ωTA. Nevertheless, our results lay the groundwork for a more comprehensive understanding of the 
transamination mechanism.
Methods
Cloning, overexpression, and purification. The pET24a(+ ) expression vector for Tr-ω TA was con-
structed. The plasmid was delivered into Escherichia coli  BL21(DE3) for transformation. A single colony was 
selected and cultured in lysogeny broth medium containing 50 μg/ml kanamycin at 37 °C overnight. The result-
ing cells were cultured on a large scale at 37 °C until the optical density value at 600 nm reached approximately 
0.6. Overexpression of the gene was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside and the cells

were further cultured at 20 °C for 18 h. The cultured cells were harvested by centrifugation, washed with buffer 
A [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, and 20 mM imidazole], flash-frozen with liquid N 2, and stored at 
−80 °C until use.
The cell pellet was resuspended with buffer A supplemented with phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride 
(Sigma-Aldrich) as a serine protease inhibitor and lysed by sonication on ice using 30-s bursts with a 1-min time 
interval between each burst. The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 10,000 g for 30 min at 4 °C. The 
supernatant was mixed with Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid resins by gentle agitation overnight. The mixture was loaded 
onto a gravity-flow column pre-equilibrated with buffer A. The column was washed with buffer B [20 mM Tris-HCl 
(pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, and 60 mM imidazole] twice. Then, the Tr-ωTA protein was eluted with buffer C [20 mM 
Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, and 250 mM imidazole]. The eluate was loaded onto a Superdex 200 Increase 
10/300 GL 24 ml column (GE Healthcare) pre-equilibrated with buffer D [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM 
NaCl]. SEC purification was performed using an ÄKTA explorer system (GE Healthcare). Protein fractions were 
harvested, concentrated to 10 mg/ml using a centrifugal 0.2-μ m filter, flash-frozen in liquid N
2, and stored at 
−80 °C until use for crystallization experiments. All of the purification fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE.
Crystallization and data collection. The initial crystallization conditions were screened using commer-
cial screening kits such as Wizard I and II (Hampton Research). Crystals were initially obtained from a buffer 
condition consisting of 1 M sodium citrate tribasic and 0.1 M imidazole/HCl (pH 8.0). The crystallization con -
dition was optimized by modulating buffer concentration and pH, and supplementing an additive. For drop-
let preparation, 1 μl of protein solution was mixed with an equal volume of reservoir solution. Each droplet 
was equilibrated against 400 μl of the mother liquor using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method at 20 °C. 
Diffraction-quality crystals appeared in 10 days under a buffer condition of 0.9 M sodium citrate tribasic, 0.1 M 
imidazole/HCl (pH 7.4), and 0.1 M betaine-HCl. The crystals were soaked in a cryoprotectant solution com-
prising the reservoir solution supplemented with 15% (v/v) glycerol. Then, the crystals were mounted onto a 
goniometer head and flash-cooled in a N
2 stream at −178 °C. X-ray diffraction data for Tr-ωTA were collected at 
the PAL 5C beamline (Pohang, Korea). Indexing, integrating, and scaling of the diffraction data were processed 
using HKL2000 software
35.
Structure determination and refinement. The phase of Tr-ωTA was determined by molecular replace-
ment using Phaser-MR36 in Phenix37. The structure of Vf-ωTA (PDB ID: 4E3Q) was used as a search model. The

initial model of Tr-ωTA was automatically built with AutoBuild38 in Phenix, and a portion was manually built 
using Coot39. Iterative cycles of refinement were run using phenix. refine40 in Phenix. The model refinement was 
finished when Rwork and Rfree values reached 15.3% and 15.5%, respectively. Validation for the final model was 
performed using MolProbity41.
Multiple sequence alignment was performed and displayed using Clustal Omega 42 and ESPript 3.0 (http://
espript.ibcp.fr)43, respectively. All the structural figures shown in this study were prepared using Pymol44.
Molecular docking simulations. Substrate candidates for Tr-ωTA were prepared using Avogadro45. All 
the structures were energetically minimized. Molecular docking simulations were performed using Autodock 
Vina46, a program package for molecular docking. AutoDockTools 1.5.647 was used to generate the pdbqt files of 
Tr-ωTA and the compounds. The active site-forming residues such as L23, W61, Y154, I263, K289 from subunit 
B, and F89 from subunit A were designated as flexible residues and the rest residues were set to rigid residues 
during the docking simulations. The size and spacing of a grid box including the flexible residues were set to 
20 Å × 20 Å × 20 Å and 1 Å, respectively. Other parameters were assigned default values. A total of 15 different 
conformers per docking compound were generated. The docking results were ranked using an energy scoring 
function.
Multiangle light scattering analysis. A SEC-MALS analysis was conducted to measure the absolute 
molecular weight of Tr-ωTA in solution. The protein solution was loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/300 GL 24 ml 
column pre-equilibrated with a buffer comprising 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 500 mM NaCl. The mobile 
phase was pumped at a flow rate of 0.4 ml/min at room temperature. A DAWN-treos MALS detector (Wyatt 
Technology) was used in conjunction with an ÄKTA explorer system. BSA was used as a reference. Data were 
assessed using ASTRA software provided by Wyatt Technology.
UV-Visible spectroscopic analysis. A UV-Visible absorption spectroscopic analysis for Tr-ωTA was car-
ried out using NanoPhotometer NP80 spectrophotometry (IMPEL) to specify a cofactor in Tr-ω TA. The light 
was generated using a xenon flash lamp with a bandwidth of 1.8 nm. An absorption spectrum was obtained from 
a wavelength range of 200–900 nm. Wavelengths for peak absorbance were analyzed to identify corresponding 
molecules.
