Single point mutations reveal 
amino acid residues important 
for Chromobacterium violaceum 
transaminase activity in the 
production of unnatural amino acids

Unnatural amino acids (UAAs) are chiral amines with high application potential in drug discovery 
and synthesis of other valuable chemicals. Biocatalysis offers the possibility to synthesise novel 
optically pure UAAs with different physical and chemical properties. While the biocatalytic potential 
of transaminases in the synthesis of UAAs has been demonstrated, there is still a need to improve the 
activity with non-native substrates and to understand which amino acids residues are important for 
activity with these UAAs. Using a rational design approach, six variants of Chromobacterium violaceum 
DSM30191 transaminase (CV_TA) carrying a single and one variant carrying two substitutions were 
generated. Among the variants with a single substitution, CV_Y168F showed a 2 to 2.6-fold increased 
affinity for 2-oxooctanoic acid (2-OOA) and 3-oxobutyric acid (3-OBA) methyl ester used to synthesise 
an α- and β-UAA. Analysis of the first half of the transaminase reaction showed no change in the 
activity with the donor (S)-1-phenylethylamine. The combination of W60C and Y168F substitutions 
improved the CV_TA affinity for 2-OOA 10-fold compared to the wild type. Other substitutions showed 
no change, or reduced activity with the tested substrates. Our findings provide structural information 
on CV_TA and demonstrate the potential of rational design for biosynthesis of UAAs.
The use of transaminases (TAs) in manufacturing optically pure chiral amines has been identified as one of the 
key emerging areas for the pharmaceutical industry
1–3. Unnatural amino acids (UAAs) as chiral amines can be 
applied in the manufacture of diverse anticancer agents4–6, antimicrobials7, agrochemicals and other value added 
products6,8. In addition to their prominent role in peptide research and drug discovery, UAAs can be used to 
investigate the structure and dynamics of proteins, to study protein interactions, or to control the activity of 
proteins in living cells
9. Great interest in UAAs has inspired development of numerous methods for their syn-
thesis, including biocatalysis. While the biocatalytic potential of TAs in the synthesis of UAAs has been demon-
strated
7,10,11, there is a growing need to expand the variety of UAAs which could be achieved by engineering 
existing TAs. While some TAs exhibit a naturally wide substrate range, the activity towards non-native substrates 
is usually tens of folds lower compared to the native substrate
12.
TAs catalyse the transfer of the amino group from an amino donor to an amino acceptor to produce a chi-
ral amine by a reductive amination reaction. Pyridoxal-5′ -phosphate (PLP) is used as a cofactor and acts as an 
intermediate amino group acceptor and an electron sink 13. In all known TAs the active site consists of a large 
and a small binding pocket 14. The small binding pocket allows entry of a substituent no larger than an ethyl 
group14,15. However, Kaulmann and co-workers suggested that an ω-TA originating from Chromobacterium viol-
aceum DSM30191 (CV_TA) has a wide substrate range with respect to both amino group donors and acceptors16.

The crystal structure of CV_TA has been solved 17,18. CV_TA is an (S)-enantioselective enzyme of approxi-
mately 100 kDa, that prefers amino group donors with an aromatic ring over aliphatic amines and amino acids16. 
CV_TA shows good activity with both aliphatic and aromatic acceptors, with pyruvate and glyoxylate being the 
preferred acceptors16,19,20. CV_TA is a homodimer in which each monomer has an active site that is formed by 
amino acid residues of both subunits at the dimeric interface17,18. Each active site has a PLP binding pocket and 
a substrate-binding region. In the holoenzyme form, the cofactor PLP is bound to the CV_TA apoenzyme via a 
Schiff base linkage formed between PLP and the lysine residue K288 in the active site17. PLP is further stabilised in 
the active site by interactions with the aspartic acid D259, which creates a hydrogen bond with the proton on the 
pyridine ring nitrogen, and pyridine ring itself located between tyrosine Y153 and valine V261. Moreover, a net-
work of hydrogen bonds is formed between the phosphate group of PLP and five active site residues serine S121 
and tyrosine Y153 from one monomer, and threonine T321, tyrosine Y322 and asparagine N118 from the other 
monomer
17. The substrate-binding pocket contains a large pocket involved in recognition of both hydrophobic 
and carboxyl groups, and a small pocket to accommodate a side chain of the substrate14,15,17.
Due to the availability of the crystal structure of CV_TA and its potential to react with a wide range of sub-
strates this enzyme represents an attractive target for the improvement of the activity with non-native substrates. 
Consequently, a number of studies have emerged reporting on protein engineering in developing ω-TAs biocata-
lysts with specific desired characteristics
21–23.
We have previously shown that CV_TA has activity towards aliphatic 2-oxooctanoic acid (2-OOA) produc-
ing 2-aminooctanoic acid which can be used to make anti-bacterial peptides 7. In the current study, using the 
reported CV_TA crystal structure17,18 and the modelled relationship of CV_TA with 2-OOA as the amino group 
acceptor, specific amino acid residues were selected as targets for site directed mutagenesis. To test which phase 
of the reaction was affected, the variants were further analysed by measuring the first half of the transamination 
reaction i.e. transfer of the amino group to PLP in absence of the keto acceptor. Finally, analysis of the effect of 
these mutations on the activity of CV_TA with other aliphatic substrates was undertaken to determine if such 
mutations were specific to 2-OOA or not.
Results
In silico analysis of the residues important for the CV_TA interaction with 2-oxocotanoic acid 
(2-OOA). Using the CV_TA crystal structure17,18 and the modelled relationship of CV_TA with 2-OOA as the 
amino group acceptor, specific amino acid residues were selected as targets for site directed mutagenesis (SDM, 
Fig. 1).
In order to study the interaction of the active form of CV_TA and 2-OOA we have used the crystal structure 
of the CV_TA with PLP (PDB: 4AH318). It has been shown that there are significant structure rearrangements 
between the apo- and holo-enzyme18, which led us to use the holo- form of the enzyme with PLP as the enzyme 
active structure rather than the apoenzyme.
The substrate docking was performed with the dimer after all water molecules were removed, hydrogens 
were added, and constrained minimisation was applied in order to allow only reasonable bond conformations 
and afterwards appropriate protonation states of the amino acids and possible hydrogen bonding networks were 
determined by QuickPrep in MOE 2016.0802 software (Molecular Operating Environment, 2016.0802; Chemical 
Computing Group Inc.: Montreal, Canada, 2016). 2-OOA was docked into the binding site of CV_TA using MOE 
(Fig. 1). The protein was rigid but the ligand (2-OOA) was allowed conformational flexibility. The thirty best 
ranked poses were retained for inspection and the protein ligand interaction fingerprints (PLIFs) were calculated 
to determine if different interaction patterns could be ascertained.

Based on the docking analysis and visual inspection of the binding orientation of the substrates, two amino 
acid residues were selected for SDM: tyrosine Y168 and alanine A231 (Fig.  1). The selected residues were then 
replaced with amino acid residues that would result in either a bigger binding site, or a stabilisation of the accep-
tor through hydrogen bond formation or creation of a more hydrophobic environment. Arginine R416 seems 
to be important for coordinating the substrate, and to verify this a conservative substitution to lysine K was 
made (Fig. 1). Additionally, and based on previous studies, two variants with a single mutation were prepared, 
CV_W60C and CV_S156A
24,25. It was previously shown that the substitution of tryptophan at position 60 with 
cysteine led to the increased specificity of CV_TA for the amino donor 1-PEA24. Furthermore, replacing valine 
at position 153 by alanine in Paracoccus denitrificans TA allowed accommodation of linear alkyl substrates25. The 
residue S156 in CV_TA corresponds to V153 in P . denitrificans that is credited with increasing transaminase 
enzyme activity (Fig. 2).
The activity of the CV_TA variants obtained by SDM. Six variants that contained a single amino acid 
substitution, CV_Y168F , CV_A231S, CV_A231T, CV_S156A, CV_R416K and CV_W60C were generated. To test 
the effect of amino acid substitutions, the purified variants of CV_TA were analysed in 10 ml biotransformation 
reactions with 1-PEA as an amino group donor and 2-OOA as the amino acceptor. The reaction rates of the vari-
ants were compared with the wild-type enzyme.
Enzyme activity of CV_Y168F. The tyrosine at the position 168 is located opposite to the lysine K288, which 
forms the Schiff ’s base with PLP (Fig. 1). Replacing Y168 with a phenylalanine residue (Y168F) and thus remov-
ing the hydroxyl group should allow better interaction of the enzyme and 2-OOA as a hydrophobic substrate 
(Fig. 1). Indeed, the variant Y168F exhibits 1.5-fold higher activity towards 2-OOA (Fig.  3). It is likely that by 
replacing tyrosine with phenylalanine creates more space and an increased hydrophobic environment in the 
active site, which could explain the improved activity towards the 2-OOA.
Enzyme activity of CV_A231S and CV_A231T. The docking analysis suggested that replacing the residue alanine 
231 with either serine (A231S) or threonine (A231T) as amino acids with polar uncharged side chains would

allow stabilisation of the enzyme-substrate interaction through hydrogen bonds. However, variant CV_A231S 
showed the same activity as wild-type CV_TA, while CV_A231T exhibited 6-fold lower activity when 2-OOA 
was used as the substrate (Fig. 3).
Enzyme activity of CV_S156A. It was previously shown that the mutation V153A in an ω-TA originating from 
Paracoccus denitrificans improved the enzyme activity 4-fold towards 2-OOA
25. The residue S156 in ω-TA of C. 
violaceum is corresponding to the residue V153 in P . denitrificans (Fig. 2) was substituted with alanine, which 
resulted in a 4.2-fold decreased activity with 2-OOA.
Enzyme activity of CV_R416K. The substitution of R416 with lysine (R416K), also a positively charged but less 
bulky amino acid led to a 60-fold decrease in the activity (Fig. 2).
Enzyme activity of CV_W60C. Tryptophan at position 60 is one of the residues in the small pocket of the 
substrate-binding region of the CV_TA active site (Fig.  1). It was previously shown that W60 creates a steric 
barrier for the donors and acceptors 15 and that replacing W60 with cysteine (W60C) improves the first half of 
the reaction i.e. deamination of 1-PEA24. However, CV_W60C exhibited 1.7-fold lower activity towards 2-OOA 
compared to the wild-type CV_TA (Fig. 1).
Kinetic characterisation of the variant CV_Y168F. To investigate the effect of the Y168F substitution 
on the kinetic characteristics of the transaminase (Km, Kcat and Kcat/Km) the purified CV_Y168F was tested using 
the AP assay and compared with the kinetic parameters of the wild type CV_TA.
CV_Y168F exhibited 2-fold higher affinity and catalytic efficiency towards 2-OOA when compared with the 
wild-type CV_TA (Table 1).
While turnover was similar for the CV_TA and CV_Y168F towards the amino donor 1-PEA, the CV_Y168F 
variant exhibited 2.4-fold higher affinity (Table 1). This resulted in 2.3-fold increased catalytic efficiency of CV_
Y168F variant compared to the wild type enzyme (Table 1).
Monitoring the first half of the reaction catalysed by variant CV_Y168F. To assess which phase of 
the reaction was affected by substituting Y168 with F , the kinetic properties of the variant and the wild type CV_
TA were assessed using the first half of the TA reaction24. In this assay only 1-PEA was used as the substrate and 
the formation of AP was monitored. The donor was supplied in a range of concentrations from 0.1 to 20 mM, and 
since there was no acceptor to recycle the cofactor, 250-fold higher concentration of PLP compared to the stand-
ard assay was used to allow the detection of AP . As a consequence of no cofactor recycling during the reaction, 
the molecule of enzyme that performs the half reaction will become inactive. Therefore, a 23-fold higher enzyme 
concentration, compared to reactions with keto acceptor, was supplied to the reaction compared to standard reac-
tion conditions. The variant CV_W60C was also analysed as it has been shown previously that this substitution 
resulted in the enzyme having a higher affinity toward 1-PEA when pyruvate was used as amino group acceptor
24.
The affinity for 1-PEA and catalytic efficiency of the wild-type CV_TA and the variant CV_Y168F were the 
same in the half reaction (Table  2). This result strongly suggests that the Y168F substitution in the active site 
improves the second half-reaction with 2-OOA as an acceptor, while not affecting the first-half reaction (Table 2). 
The substitution W60C improves the first half-reaction as enzyme affinity and turnover number increased

3.3-fold and 4.8-fold respectively, resulting in up to 13-fold increase in catalytic efficiency for the first half of the 
reaction compared with CV_TA and CV_Y168F .
The kinetics of double mutant CV_W60C/Y168F transaminase activity. Given the positive impact 
of W60C and Y168F substitutions on enzyme activity a CV_TA variant carrying both substitutions was gener -
ated. This variant showed 10- and 5-fold increased affinity for 2-OOA compared to the wild type and CV_Y168F 
(Tables 1 and 3). While the turnover with 2-OOA decreased 2- and 2.3-fold compared to the CV_Y168F and WT, 
the overall catalytic efficiency of the double mutant was 4.4-fold higher compared to the WT and 2.2-fold higher 
compared to the single mutant (Tables 1 and 3). CV_W60C/Y168F showed increased catalytic efficiency towards 
1-PEA compared with the wild type when half-reaction was monitored, but 3.3-fold lower efficiency compared 
to the W60C variant (Tables 2 and 3).
Enzyme activity of CV_TA variants with a range of aliphatic substrates. We have identified a num-
ber of amino acid substitutions that affect CV_TA activity. To understand if these substitutions are specific to 
2-OOA as a substrate or if they generally affect enzyme activity a range of aliphatic amino group acceptors were 
tested with CV_TA and its variants (Fig. 3 and Table S1).
The only improvement in activity of a CV_TA variant was observed in the case of CV_Y168F with 
3-oxobutyric acid methyl ester (3-OBA methyl ester), showing 2-fold higher activity compared to the CV_TA 
(Fig. 4). When tested with other substrates this variant exhibited activity similar to the wild type CV_TA. Other 
substitutions caused a decrease in activity of corresponding variants. The most profound effect was seen when 
R416 was replaced with K resulting in a 40 to 260-fold decrease in the activity with aliphatic substrates compared 
to the wild type (Fig. 4).
Analysis of the kinetic parameters of CV_Y168F with 3-OBA methyl ester as an amino acceptor revealed that 
this variant has 2.6-fold higher affinity and 2.4-fold higher catalytic efficiency towards 3-OBA methyl ester com-
pared to the wild type enzyme (Table 4). In silico analysis of the CV_TA interaction with 3-OBA methyl ester as 
amino acceptor suggested that the replacement of Y168 by F could allow better hydrophobic interaction with this 
substrate (Fig. 5). Interestingly, the double mutant showed no activity with 3-OBA methyl ester (Fig. 4).
Among the α -keto substrates that were tested, CV_TA and variants showed the highest activity towards 
2-oxohexanoic acid (2-OHA) followed by 2-oxobutyric acid (2-OBA) and 2-OBA methyl ester (Fig. 4). However,

except for CV_Y168F and 3-OBA methyl ester none of the variant-substrate combinations showed improved 
activity compared to the wild type enzyme (Fig. 4).
The position of the keto group has a major impact on the enzyme activity. While CV_TA and variants 
showed similar activity with 2-OBA and 2-OBA methyl ester very low activity was observed with 3-OBA methyl 
ester (Fig.  4). Similarly, no activity was observed with either 3-oxohexanoic acid (3-OHA) methyl ester or 
3-oxooctanoic acid (3-OOA) methyl ester, while CV_TA and variants showed activity with corresponding 2-keto 
acids (Figs 2 and 4). The lack of a commercially available methyl ester of 2-oxohexanoic or 2-oxooctanoic acid 
did not allow us to further test the structure-function effect of chain length and the presence of a methyl moiety.
Discussion
The availability of the crystal structure of CV_TA18 and the in silico analysis performed in this study allowed the 
rational design of amino acid substitutions which revealed important residues for CV_TA activity. We have tar-
geted 6 amino acid residues of CV_TA which resulted in 6 variants with a single amino acid substitution.
One of the residues located in the active site entrance of CV_TA, tyrosine 168 (Y168) was predicted to poten-
tially cause a hydroxyl group polarity clash with the aliphatic sidechain of 2-OOA. When this residue was replaced 
with phenylalanine, a variant CV_Y168F was designed and resulted in 2-fold increase in catalytic efficiency with 
2-OOA (Table 1). The residue Y168 was found to be highly variable when the CV_TA sequence was compared 
to 100 ω-TAs sharing >40% identity
23. However, this residue is part of a second helical turn K167-G173, which 
together with a loop G152-T157, and a helical turn I158-L163 makes part of the active site 23. It is hypothesised 
that changing highly conserved residues would have the most dramatic effect on the activity of an enzyme 23,26. 
However, we found that the substitution of the residue Y168, which while part of the active site is not conserved, 
resulted in a positive effect on the activity of CV_TA (Fig. 1).
It is likely that replacing tyrosine with phenylalanine created more space in the active site along with an 
increased hydrophobic environment, which potentially allowed better interaction of the enzyme with 2-OOA. 
However, a resolved crystal structure of the variant CV_Y168F is required to understand the structural rearrange-
ments caused by the tyrosine to phenylalanine substitution and the reason for improved activity. The affinity of 
the variant CV_Y168F and wild type enzyme for 1-PEA remained the same (Table 2), indicating that the amino 
acid residue change affected the second half of the reaction which could be explained through stabilisation of the 
enzyme-acceptor interaction.
The variant CV_W60C, created with the goal of removing a steric barrier formed by tryptophan (W60) posi-
tioned in the small binding pocket
27, was shown to have higher affinity towards 1-PEA (Table 2). However, this

change clearly affected only the first half of the reaction, as it gave at least 1.5-fold lower activity with all tested 
acceptors (Figs 3 and 4). The W60 residue is considered highly conserved among ω-TAs23. Replacing W60 with a 
smaller amino acid cysteine could generate more space in the active site that facilitates the binding of the aromatic 
amino group acceptor 1-PEA and improves the first half-reaction
27. It is possible that this increase in catalytic effi-
ciency of the enzyme with the donor is not followed by the increase in the efficiency of the second half-reaction, 
thus explaining the overall decrease in the reaction efficiency with all tested acceptors.
Combining the W60C substitution with Y168F substitution generated a variant with a higher catalytic effi-
ciency when 2-OOA was used as amino group acceptor (Table 3). However, the same variant showed no activity 
with 3-OBA methyl ester (Fig. 4) and thus further work is required to explain these differences.
While there are some reports suggesting that the residue arginine R416 is among the conserved key active site 
residues involved in substrate specificity in ω-TAs
12,15,28–30, Deszcz and colleagues found that R416 shows a cer-
tain degree of variability among ω-TA23. It seems to be important for the recognition of the α-carboxylate group 
of both the amino group donor and acceptor by building a salt bridge and hydrogen bonds15,18,31. In the current 
study, replacing arginine with another positively charged, but less bulky amino acid lysine, generated an enzyme, 
which retained less than 3% relative activity with all tested substrates, whether they were acids or esters (Figs  3 
and 4). The side chain of the R416 residue is positioned inside or outside of the active site depending on the sub-
strate
32. If the substrate contains a carboxylic group then residue R416 forms a salt bridge with the carboxylate 
moiety, therefore facilitating deamination by decreasing the energy barrier32. If a substrate without a carboxylate 
moiety is used, the R416 side chain faces outwards32. However, this seems to be a specific case with the CV_TA, 
since when the arginine residue of ω -TA of V. fluvialis was replaced with lysine the generated variant showed 
increased activity towards 1-PEA, (S )-phenylalanine and (S )-aminophenylacetate as amino group donors and 
pyruvate, oxophenylacetate and 2-oxo-3-phenylpropionate as amino group acceptors31.
We speculated that changing the alanine residue A231 into an amino acid with polar uncharged side chains, 
serine (A231S) or threonine (A231T) would allow stabilisation of the enzyme-substrate interaction through 
hydrogen bonds. However, no improvement in activity was observed (Fig.  3). This residue when substituted 
with phenylalanine and in combination with F88A substitution resulted in a substrate-dependent shift in 
enantioselectivity
27.
Although the CV_TA and P . denitrificans share only 38% amino acid identity, their crystal structures are 
highly similar33. However, CV_TA has more space in the active site with higher hydrophobicity that makes the 
enzyme more active towards aliphatic substrates with medium chain length such as 6-aminohexanoic acid and 
nonanal33. Serine at position 156 in CV_TA is the amino acid which corresponds to the residue V153 in P. deni-
trificans (Fig.  2). Nevertheless, designing the substitution which corresponds to V153A resulted in a variant 
with 4-fold lower activity towards 2-OOA compared to the CV_TA, and lower activity with all tested substrates 
(Fig. 1).
Based on the in silico analysis of the CV_TA–targeted acceptor interactions, amino acid substitutions in this 
study were selected for their potential to positively impact on transaminase activity. However, only the Y168F 
substitution proved to be beneficial for activity towards the targeted substrate 2-OOA and 3-OBA methyl ester, 
while combined W60C/Y168F was only beneficial for 2-OOA as a substrate. The first half of the transaminase 
reaction is unaffected by the substitution of tyrosine with phenylalanine at residue 168 indicating the improved 
reaction rate for CV_Y168F is due to the influence on the second half of the reaction. Finally, 2-OOA and 3-OBA 
methyl ester are interesting substrates as the corresponding amines are an alpha fatty unnatural amino acid and a 
beta unnatural amino acid respectively with application potential
8. 2-AOA (2-aminocaprylic acid) is used in the 
preparation of 1, 5-disubstituted-2-aminoimidazoles, which have antibiotic activity34. Furthermore, 2-AOA can 
be used to design a vaccine delivery system without the need for additional adjuvants 35 and to modify antimi -
crobial peptides for the improved activity7. 3-aminobutyric acid (3-ABA) or β-homoalanine has been used in the 
synthesis of a bioactive peptide for the treatment of autoimmune diseases36. Moreover, 3-ABA has activity against 
different plant viruses, bacteria, nematodes and fungi37.
Methods
Molecular docking of substrates in the active site of CV_TA. The crystal structure of Chromobacterium 
violaceum (DSM30191) with PLP accommodated in the active site 4AH318 was used to study the active site and 
select residues that can be changed to improve the activity of CV_TA towards 2-OOA and 3-OBA methyl ester. All 
protein preparation and modelling work was undertaken in MOE 2016.0802
38. The docking site of the receptor was 
defined by selecting PLP and F88, extending by 4.5 Å. Protein Ligand Interaction Fingerprints (PLIF) analysis was 
undertaken on all 30 refined docking poses of each compound to determine amino acid preferred contacts.
In vitro site directed mutagenesis (SDM), protein expression and purification. The transaminase 
gene of C. violaceum was amplified and cloned into pET-45b(+ ) vector as previously described 7. Site-directed 
mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChange II XL Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, 
USA) according to manufacturer’s instructions. The oligonucleotide primers used for the site-directed mutagen-
esis are listed in Table 5. The resulting variants were verified by sequencing (GATC Biotech Hamburg, Germany). 
The protein expression and purification of wild type and variants was carried out as previously described
7.
Activity of the wild type enzyme and SDM variants with different amino group acceptors. The 
activity of CV_TA towards different amino group acceptors was determined by a spectrophotometric assay based 
on using (S)-(−)-1-phenylethylamine (1-PEA) as the amino group donor and formation of acetophenone (AP) 
that can be measured spectrophotometrically
39. The assay conditions were as previously described7.

The activity of the variants generated by SDM was tested in a 10 ml biotransformation by AP assay. The amino 
group donor to acceptor ratio was 4:1 (10 mM 1-PEA: 2.5 mM acceptor) except when using 3-OBA methyl ester 
1:2 ratio was applied (10 mM 1-PEA: 20 mM 3-OBA methyl ester). The 10 ml biotransformation was performed 
using glass tubes (PYREX, England) with 0.044 mg/ml of purified enzyme at 45 °C and shaking 200 rpm. Samples 
(0.5 ml) were taken every 15 min for 180 min and the reaction was stopped by adding 0.2% TFA (v/v) followed by 
10-fold dilution with 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer. The AP formation was then measured.
Kinetic characterisation of CV_TA and CV_Y168F. Kinetic studies of the CV_TA activity towards the 
amino group donor, 1-PEA and amino group acceptors; 2-OOA and 3-OBA methyl ester; were performed by 
measuring the production of AP . The assay was performed under conditions previously described7. To study the 
affinity (Km) of CV_TA for the amino group donor 1-PEA, the concentration of 1-PEA was varied from 0.1 to 
20 mM, while the acceptor, 2-OOA or 3-OBA methyl ester was fixed at 2.5 mM. The concentration of the amino 
group donor 1-PEA was then fixed at 10 mM and the concentration of the acceptors was varied from 0.1 to 20 mM 
to determine the Km of CV_TA for 2-OOA and 3-OBA methyl ester.
The initial reaction rates were obtained by fitting linearly the change in absorbance (Δ Abs245) over time. 
Kinetic parameters were calculated according to the Lineweaver and Burk double reciprocal method, which 
allows for the determination of the Michaelis Menten constant (K
m) and the maximum velocity of the reaction 
(Vmax)40. The results were confirmed by using non-linear regression analysis software, Enzfitter for Windows 
2.0.18.0 (Elsevier, Biosoft ®, UK). Using the V max values the turnover number (K cat) and catalytic efficiency 
(Km/Kcat) of CV_TA was determined for each amino group acceptor40.
Characterisation of the half-transamination reaction. The deamination of 1-PEA results in irrevers-
ible AP formation in the absence of an acceptor by using PLP as amino group acceptor 39. This characteristic 
was used to assess the effect of mutations CV_Y168F , CV_W60C and CV_W60/Y168F on the first half of the 
transamination reaction and the affinity (K
m) towards the amino donor 1-PEA. The Km of variants was compared 
to the Km of the wild type CV_TA. The reaction was set up in 1 ml total volume and it contained: 0.1–20 mM 
1-PEA, 5 mM PLP , 1 mg/ml purified enzyme and 0.25% DMSO in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0. 
It was carried out at 45 °C for 4 h with shaking at 200 rpm. Aliquots of 0.01 ml were sampled at times 0 and then 
every 60 min for 4 h and mixed with the same volume of 0.2% TFA (v/v) to stop the reaction, followed by 10-fold 
dilution with 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0. The formation of AP was measured spectrophotomet-
rically at 245 nm.
