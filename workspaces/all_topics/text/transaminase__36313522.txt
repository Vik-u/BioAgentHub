ABSTRACT: Tambjamine YP1 is a pyrrole-containing natural product. Analysis of
the enzymes encoded in the Pseudoalteromonas tunicata “tam” biosynthetic gene
cluster (BGC) identified a unique di-domain biocatalyst (PtTamH). Sequence and
bioinformatic analysis predicts that PtTamH comprises an N-terminal, pyridoxal 5′-
phosphate (PLP)-dependent transaminase (TA) domain fused to a NADH-
dependent C-terminal thioester reductase (TR) domain. Spectroscopic and chemical
analysis revealed that the TA domain binds PLP, utilizes L -Glu as an amine donor,
accepts a range of fatty aldehydes (C
7
−C
14
with a preference for C
12
), and produces
the corresponding amines. The previously characterized PtTamA from the “tam”
BGC is an ATP-dependent, di-domain enzyme comprising a class I adenylation
domain fused to an acyl carrier protein (ACP). Since recombinant PtTamA catalyzes
the activation and thioesterification of C
12
acid to the holo-ACP domain, we
hypothesized that C
12
ACP is the natural substrate for PtTamH. PtTamA and
PtTamH were successfully coupled together in a biocatalytic cascade that converts
fatty acids (FAs) to amines in one pot. Moreover, a structural model of PtTamH provides insights into how the TA and TR domains
are organized. This work not only characterizes the formation of the tambjamine YP1 tail but also suggests that PtTamA and
PtTamH could be useful biocatalysts for FA to amine functional group conversion.

INTRODUCTION
Natural products (NPs) continue to inspire synthetic chemists
to develop routes toward a variety of interesting molecules
with important, clinically useful functions.
1
Comprehensive
genome sequence analysis has revealed that the encoded genes
responsible for NP biosynthesis reside in biosynthetic gene
clusters (BGCs).
2,3
These BGCs harbor novel and unusual
biocatalysts that could potentially be applied in the synthesis of
a range of targets.
4,5
If the substrate range of the native
biocatalyst is too narrow for a desired function, engineering
techniques such as directed evolution can be employed to
expand its synthetic utility.
6,7
Prodiginines are a class of secondary metabolites found in
various organisms including the prodigiosin-producing Serratia
sp. (pig cluster) and Hahella chejuensis (hap cluster), as well as
Streptomyces coelicolor (red cluster), which predominantly
produces undecylprodiginine, and Streptomyces griseoviridis
(rph cluster), which produces prodigiosin R1 (Figure 1).
8−11
They are structurally related to tambjamines (A-K, BE-18591,
YP1) through a 4-methoxy-2,2′-bipyrrole-5-carbaldehyde
(MBC) core, which is conserved throughout the entire
prodiginine and tambjamine NP families (Figure 1). Extensive
analysis identified a conserved set of homologous genes
responsible for MBC biosynthesis within their respective
BGCs. To form prodigiosin, the MBC core is condensed with
another intermediate, 2-methyl-3-n-amyl-pyrrole (MAP); the
first reported extraction of this NP was from the bacterium
Serratia marcescens. Alternatively, a MAP derivative can be
used.
12
However, in the case of tambjamines, the MBC
intermediate is condensed with an amine to form an enamine
moiety in place of the third pyrrole ring. The biosynthetic
production of these secondary intermediates can differ, along
with the enzymes utilized for their production.
Along with the prodiginine and tambjamine families, NPs’
with pyrroles built into their scaffolds are ubiquitous in nature.
The planar, electron-rich ring is able to form hydrogen bonds,
chelate metal ions, and participate in π-stacking interactions.
13
These five-membered N-heterocyclic-containing products
often exhibit antimicrobial, antiviral or anticancer bioactivity,
which has led to their use as therapeutic agents.

A yellow-pigmented alkaloid, identified as tambjamine YP1
(YP1), was extracted from Pseudoalteromonas tunicata.

gous red and pig proteins helped to identify a distinct BGC
designated as the “tam” cluster, which is responsible for YP1
biosynthesis (Figure S1).
18
Of the 19 genes predicted, only a
few have been expressed and their encoded enzymes
characterized. The biosynthesis of YP1 requires two converg-
ing pathways; the first pathway produces the MBC core,
whereas the second pathway produces the fatty amine tail.
Since MBC biosynthesis is highly conserved, the genes
required to make this bipyrrole core can be confidently
predicted and annotated. However, the production and
attachment of the unsaturated fatty amine tail are less well-
understood.
The initial aim of this study was to characterize the
formation of the fatty amine precursor to YP1. It was originally
proposed that this second pathway in YP1 biosynthesis was
initiated by AfaA, a fatty acid CoA ligase (FACL) not found
within the “tam” cluster.
19
Our recent investigations showed
that another enzyme, PtTamA [a di-domain enzyme
comprising a class I adenylation (ANL) domain fused to an
acyl carrier protein (ACP)], found within the “tam” cluster
catalyzed this step. This enzyme uses adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) and a C
12
fatty acid (FA) to catalyze the formation of a
C
12
adenylate, which is then captured by the 4′-phospho-
pantetheine (4′-PP)-modified ACP domain to form an acyl-
ACP-bound PtTamA.
20,21
This PtTamA analysis led us to
question how the bound acyl chain is released for further
downstream tailoring. Two other enzymes in the BGC
(PtTamH and PtTamT) are predicted to be involved in the
formation of the amine tail after PtTamA, although their exact
function is yet unknown. Here, comprehensive sequence,
spectroscopic, and chemical analysis revealed that PtTamH is
the unusual fusion enzyme that carries out the acyl chain off-
loading function. We also show that recombinant PtTamA and
PtTamH act together to convert fatty acids to the
corresponding amines.
■
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Sequence Analysis. An initial bioinformatic study on
PtTamH was performed to identify and characterize its
catalytic domains. The deposited amino acid sequence of
PtTamH (941 aa, 104 kDa, NCBI reference sequence:
WP_009837236.1, Uniprot: A4C5V8) is annotated as a di-
domain enzyme, with an N-terminal, pyridoxal 5′-phosphate
(PLP)-dependent transaminase (TA) type III domain and a C-
terminal, amino acid dehydrogenase domain (Figure S2).
Approximately 50 amino acids with no annotated function
connect these two domains. An exhaustive phylogenetic
analysis performed using the ConSurf
22−26
server identified
PtTamH homologues from other Pseudoalteromonas species
including P. citrea and Pseudoalteromonas sp.A25. More
distantly related homologues with similar domain functions/
organizations are present in Chitinimonas, Paucibacter, and
Streptomyces species (Figure S3). It is currently unclear
whether these distant homologues are involved in tambjamine
biosynthesis or the closely related prodiginine biosynthetic
pathway.
27
While the N-terminal domain was confirmed to be a PLP-
dependent ω-transaminase
28
(ω-TA, residues M
1
-K
500
) by
BLASTp, further sequence analysis suggests that the C-
terminal domain (residues K
547
−S
941
) is more accurately
described as a thioester reductase (TR). The proposed TR
domain of PtTamH shares sequence homology with acyl-ACP
reductases (AARs) involved in alkane biosynthesis. Such
homologues originate from cyanobacterial species including
Synechococcus elongates
29
(28.3% identity), Synechocystis sp.
PCC6803 (27.6% identity), and Nostoc punctiforme
30
(27.2%
identity). Following multiple sequence alignments, the canon-
ical nucleotide-binding motif GxxGxxG (G
707
xxG
710
xxG
713
)
and a putative catalytic cysteine (C
887
) were identified in
PtTamH, as well as other Pseudoalteromonas homologues
(Figure S4). As reported in the literature
31
(and further
evidenced by the crystal structure solved by Gao et al., PDB:
6JZY), the active residue C
294
in S. elongatus AAR (SeAAR) is
responsible for acyl chain transfer from a 4'-PP carrier such as
holo-ACP or coenzyme A (CoA). The resulting thioester is
optimally positioned for hydride attack by nicotinamide
adenine dinucleotide phosphate hydrogen (NADPH), releas-
ing an aldehyde. An identical mechanism was proposed by
Warui et al. for N. punctiforme AAR.
30
Given the apparent
sequence similarity around this active site cysteine, it is
plausible that the PtTamH TR domain employs a comparable
mechanism to liberate 4'-PP-bound intermediates as aldehyde

products. Thus, from this sequence analysis, PtTamH was
putatively redefined a bifunctional ω-TA-TR fusion biocatalyst.
Characterization of Recombinant PtTamH. Recombi-
nant PtTamH was cloned into the pEHISTEV plasmid and
expressed from Escherichia coli with a TEV cleavable HisTag
(Figures S5−S7). The addition of 500 mM sorbitol to the
growth media promotes correct protein folding, improving
protein solubility.
32
The soluble PtTamH was isolated using a
combination of cobalt-/nickel-immobilized metal affinity
chromatography (IMAC) followed by size exclusion chroma-
tography (SEC), which enabled the isolation of ∼1.5 mg/L.
After initial isolation to characterize PtTamH, and due to high
protein purity after IMAC, SEC was omitted from the
purification process, which led to a slightly higher protein

amine of the transamination reactions of PtTamH (5 μM) in the presence of either L -Glu (5 mM) or L -Ala (5 mM) and
C

aldehyde (1 mM) for 24 h at 37 °C, leading to a peak with a retention time that corresponds to the amine standard. Each reaction was
completed in triplicate.

yield of ∼3 mg/L. The SEC retention volume confirmed the
homodimeric nature of PtTamH (>200 kDa, see Figures S8
and S9); this observation was expected as PLP-dependent
enzymes often form dimers or tetramers.
33
PtTamH Is a Transaminase. The purified PtTamH
exhibited a strong yellow color and displayed a characteristic
PLP spectrum when studied by UV−vis spectroscopy (Figure
S10). As exemplified by the homologue CrmG, class III ω-TAs
display a preference for either L -Glu or L -Ala as the amino
donor; therefore, both amino acids were tested as substrates.
The covalent binding of L -Glu to the key catalytic lysine
(putative K
340
) was confirmed by UV−vis analysis, where the
emergence of a peak at 330 nm indicates the formation of the
pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP) intermediate (Figure S10).
To confirm the activity of the predicted N-terminal ω-TA
domain, PtTamH was incubated with L -Glu or L -Ala and C
12
aldehyde for 24 h, and the formation of the C
12
amine product
was monitored by liquid chromatography (LC) electrospray
ionization-mass spectroscopy (ESI-MS). We observed a peak
matching the retention time (16.2 min) of the C
12
amine
standard in both reactions. The extracted ion chromatograms
(EICs) revealed an ion with m/z = 186.2222 Da, which
matches with the predicted mass of C
12
primary amine ([M +
H]
+
, C
12
H
28
N) (Figure 2).
Since the NP YP1 contains a C
12
tail, it was hypothesized
that PtTamH prefers C
12
aldehyde as its primary substrate. We
therefore probed the chain-length specificity of the PtTamH ω-
TA domain using LC ESI-MS. When PtTamH was screened
against a palette of aliphatic fatty aldehydes (C
6
−C
14
), the
corresponding amine products (except C
6
) were detected, and
a clear preference for C
12
aldehyde was also observed (Figures
3 and S11). These data show that PtTamH displays a broad
acyl chain selectivity between C
7
−C
14
fatty aldehydes.
PtTamH TR Domain. After demonstrating the activity of
the PtTamH N-terminal ω-TA domain, we next focused on the
predicted C-terminal TR domain. Inspired by the study of
coelimycin biosynthesis by Awodi et al.�which involves an
analogous TR-aminotransferase cooperativity
34
�PtTamH was
incubated with C
12
CoA and either NADH or NADPH in the
presence of L -Glu. Furthermore, the reaction mixture was
supplemented with 200 mM KCl and 10 mM MgCl
2
as both
magnesium and potassium ions have been found to drastically
improve the activity of homologous AARs.
29−31
However, no
C
12
amine product was observed in either the NADH or
NADPH reactions. This suggested that the PtTamH TR
domain is either inactive or does not accept acyl-CoA
substrates (Figure S12).
Coupled TamA-TamH Cascade. The inability of the
PtTamH TR domain to accept a free acyl-CoA thioester
substrate was not entirely unexpected. As previously discussed,
the tambjamine YP1 BGC encodes PtTamA, a di-domain
ACP-ANL natural fusion. Our earlier investigations showed
that the PtTamA ANL domain can activate carboxylic acids of
various chain lengths (C
6
−C
14
) and attach them to the 4′-PP
arm of the fused ACP domain.
20,21
The presence of this
enzyme suggests that PtTamH may be acyl-ACP dependent,
transferring the acyl chain directly from the PtTamA acyl-ACP
domain to the PtTamH TR domain.
Therefore, a cascade reaction was performed using purified
PtTamA (Figure S13), prepared with the ACP domain in its 4'-
PP-activated holo-form.
20,21
PtTamA was incubated with
PtTamH in the presence of C
12
acid, MgATP, KCl, NADH
or NADPH, and L -Glu, and the production of the
corresponding C
12
amine was monitored by LC ESI-MS
(Figure 4). A peak with m/z = 186.2222 Da was detected by
LC ESI-MS in the NADH reaction. In contrast, no amine is
produced in the NADPH reaction, illustrating that PtTamH is
NADH-specific (Figure 4). The amine product was also absent
in the control reactions. Furthermore, the gas chromatography
(GC)−MS study of the PtTamA-PtTamH cascade in the
absence of L -Glu enabled the detection of the C
12
aldehyde
intermediate (Figure S14). Taken all together, our data not
only confirm that the PtTamH TR domain is catalytically
active but also confirm that it exhibits an innate specificity for
the C
12
ACP substrate. The four domains are therefore
working in concert to convert the acid to an amine. The C
12
acid is activated by the PtTamA ANL domain
35,36
in an ATP-
dependent reaction that leads to the formation of the C
12
adenylate intermediate. The PtTamA holo-ACP 4'-PP thiol acts
as a nucleophile, attacking the C
12
adenylate and releasing
AMP. Once captured, the C
12
ACP is then reduced by the
PtTamH TR domain using NADH, forming the C
12
aldehyde.
The final step involves transamination to give the final C
12
amine, catalyzed by the PtTamH TA domain (Figure 5). The
experimental data supports the initial bioinformatic annota-
tions of both PtTamA and PtTamH and show that the
conversion of C
12
FA to C
12
fatty amine is catalyzed by this
cascade of di-domain fusion biocatalysts (Figure 5).
Predictive Structural Modeling. Following experimental
characterization, we sought to understand the structural logic
underpinning the activity of PtTamH. To this end, a head-to-
head homodimeric model of PtTamH was predicted using the
accurate deep-learning program ColabFold
37−39
(Figure 6, see
also the Supporting Information for further details) and
studied by molecular dynamics simulation (MDS). The
predicted ω-TA domain shares structural homology with
several ω-TA crystal structures including YgjG
40
(PDB:
4UOX, 30.1% identity), PigE
41
(PDB: 4PPM, 30.5% identity),
ArgD (PDB: 1VEF, 31.4% identity), and CrmG
42
(PDB:
5DDS, 29.0% identity), with the latter displaying the highest
sequence coverage of the homologues identified (90%, Figure
6D). Evolutionary conservation analysis and superimposition
of the aforementioned ω-TA structures show that the PLP-

binding core is highly conserved, including the key PLP-
binding residue K
340
(Figure S15A,B). This critical lysine
covalently binds PLP via a Schiff base linkage, thereby enabling
the coenzyme to participate in transamination (Figure
S15B).
43,44
Furthermore, the ω-TA domains are predicted to
comprise the homodimeric interface; identical interfaces exist
across all solved ω-TA structures to date, and ω-TA
dimerization is essential for defining the active site. Using
this model, the C
12
external aldimine could be docked in the
predicted ω-TA binding tunnel, with the PMP moiety flanked

and the alkyl chain extending toward a
hydrophobic pocket comprising F

, L

, and L

from chain
A and M
365
from chain B (Figure S15B,C).
The predicted PtTamH TR model and the crystal structure
of SeAAR could be comfortably superimposed (Figure 6D),
enabling further structural study. PtTamH TR is modeled with
a classic Rossmann fold for nucleotide binding. An alkyl-
binding pocket was also inferred by structural homology and
topological analysis (Figure S16A), encompassing several
hydrophobic residues (including F
550
, L
554
, I
555
, L
560
, I
563
,
L
591
, and L
874
) complementary to the lipophilicity of PtTamH’s
natural substrate (Figure S16B). Like SeAAR, the putative
catalytic cysteine C
887
is positioned at the intersection between
the NADH- and alkyl-binding subdomains. Evolutionary
conservation analysis suggests that the active core of the
reductase is highly conserved, including residues involved in
nucleotide binding as well as C
887
itself (Figure S17A). By
comparison, the residues predicted to stabilize the acyl chain
display greater variability, which may suggest an additional
substrate-recognition role for this pocket. With this knowledge,
both NAD
+
and C
12
aldehyde ligands were docked in this
predicted active site. The top-ranked outputs position the
aldehyde carbonyl near C
887
and the NAD
+
pyridine (Figure
S17B), with the alkyl chain extending into the predicted
hydrophobic pocket (Figure S17C,D). These poses are
remarkably similar to the ligand orientation in the SeAAR
crystal structure (Figure S17E) and suggest a conserved active
site architecture within this class of reductases.
The fully predicted PtTamH homodimer maintained its
structural integrity over the course of a 10 ns MDS (see
Figures S18 and S19 in the Supporting Information for
detailed analysis). The simulated 208 kDa complex positions
the TR domains laterally from the ω-TA core. Studying the
electrostatic properties of PtTamH revealed an electropositive
surface on the solvent-exposed substrate channel of the TR
domain, which may underpin the recognition/docking of the
comparatively acidic PtTamA ACP (Figure S20).
45
Thus, the
predicted domain organization of PtTamH would permit the
facile transfer of acyl intermediates between the ACP of
PtTamA and the TR domain of PtTamH. Taken alongside the
experimental data, the PtTamH TR domain can be confidently
classified as an AAR. The fascinating predicted architecture of
PtTamH makes it an attractive target for further structural
studies.

CONCLUSIONS
The application of biocatalysts for the synthesis of a range of
high-value molecules (e.g., sitagliptin and islatravir)
46
is
gaining in popularity.
47−49
Once an enzyme has been
discovered, its substrate specificity can be engineered to
widen the substrate scope for a bespoke synthetic application.
6
A rich source of these enzymes has been NP biosynthetic
pathways which have evolved to efficiently transform simple
building blocks into complex structures with a myriad of
functionalities.
50
These NPs are often encoded in BGCs where
each enzyme plays a specific role in the stepwise trans-
formation along a linear path. Along with these discrete, single-
domain biocatalysts, the polyketide and nonribosomal peptide
classes of NPs are members of a large family whose
biosynthesis is driven by large, multidomain assemblies.
45,51,52
The fused domains within these molecular machines have
clearly evolved to efficiently transfer intermediates between
active sites. A key player within the complex is the acyl-ACP
substrate which relays covalently tethered substrates between
domains.
The tambjamine YP1 BGC encodes a pathway to convert
long-chain FAs to the essential hydrophobic fatty amine tails of
these biologically active NPs. The details of this part of the
pathway were unclear until we reported that the PtTamA
enzyme is a di-domain fusion of an N-terminal ANL to a C-
terminal ACP.
20,21
However, the details involved in the
downstream processing of the novel PtTamA acyl-ACP
intermediate were unknown. In this study, the putative
biocatalyst PtTamH was analyzed using comprehensive
bioinformatic analysis. This predicted PtTamH to also be a
di-domain fusion with an N-terminal domain that displays
high-sequence homology to a class III PLP-dependent TA.
This is fused to a C-terminal domain whose sequence and
structural homology suggest that it is a member of the AAR
family. To assign a function to the individual domains, the
recombinant PtTamH was initially shown to bind PLP and
catalyze the conversion of C
12
aldehyde to the corresponding
C
12
amine. The preferred amine donor was found to be L -Glu
(but it can also accept L -Ala to a lesser extent), and it also
displays a broad substrate promiscuity by being able to accept
C
7
−C
14
aldehydes. In future, the synthetic utility of this TA
could be further expanded by studying its activity with smart
amine donors such as cadaverine, o-xylylenediamine, and N-
phenylputrescine (NPP).
53−55
The outstanding activity to be defined was that of the origin
of the aldehyde substrate, and we predicted that the TR
domain would catalyze the reduction of an acyl-thioester
substrate, but PtTamH was unable to convert C
12
CoA to the
corresponding C
12
aldehyde. However, we established that the
PtTamH TR domain was catalytically active by successfully
constructing a biocatalytic cascade which converted the C
12
acid to the corresponding amine. Moreover, we also detected
the formation of an aldehyde intermediate by omission of the
amine donor. This suggests the four domains, present as two
fusions within PtTamA and PtTamH, worked together and
that the PtTamH TR domain requires a specific acyl-ACP-
bound thioester substrate. Defining the function of PtTamH,
and coupling it with PtTamA, finally resolves the origin of the
fatty amine tail of tambjamine YP1.
18,20,21,56
Further work on the PtTamA-PtTamH system could be
carried out to fully explore the substrate scope of this novel
biocatalytic cascade. This would be enabled by determination
of the three-dimensional structures of both enzymes; our
sequence and structural analyses has provided initial insights
into the chemistry and logic underpinning PtTamH-PtTamA
cooperativity. The dimeric PtTamH is >200 kDa and is also an
excellent candidate for cryogenic electron microscopy
studies.
57
Further issues to be resolved include the molecular
details of how each domain interacts with each other and how
substrates and products navigate between catalytic sites.
Tambjamine YP1 contains an oxidized acyl chain (with cis
geometry between C
3
and C
4
), and PtTamT within the P.
tunicata BGC has been proposed to perform this oxidation.
The active biocatalytic cascade described here will allow
functional analysis of this remaining useful enzyme. Fur-
thermore, along with YP1, Picott et al. have recently
characterized the macrocyclic tambjamine derivative MYP1
produced by P. citrea. Initial analysis identifies PtTamA and
PtTamH homologues [TreaA (Uniprot: U1J4V2) and TreaH
(Uniprot: U1KHB2)], in the BGC of this organism, which
both show 71% identity to PtTamA and PtTamH, respectively.

Our work lays the foundation to reveal the similarities and
differences between the two biosynthetic pathways.
56
Members of the ANL family are versatile biocatalysts that
can be used to activate a range of FA substrates and prepare
useful amides, esters, and thioesters.
58
New tools such as the
database RetroBioCat should become a useful resource to
incorporate such adaptable biocatalysts into synthetic routes
for the preparation of a range of target molecules.
59
The work
described here suggests that the functional group conversion
displayed by the PtTamA−PtTamH biocatalytic cascade would
be a valuable addition to this biocatalyst repository.
