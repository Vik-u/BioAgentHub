Abstract
Chiral N-heterocyclic molecules and in particular compounds with an amino functional group such as 3-aminopiperidine are valu-
able intermediates for the production of a large number of bioactive compounds with pharmacological properties. In this paper, the
synthesis of both enantiomers of 3-amino-1-Boc-piperidine by amination of the prochiral precursor 1-Boc-3-piperidone using
immobilized ω-transaminases (TAs-IMB), isopropylamine as amine donor and pyridoxal-5’-phosphate (PLP) as cofactor is de-
scribed. Compared to other methods, the present approach affords the target compound in just one step with high yield and high
enantiomeric excess starting from a commercial substrate. The reaction was carried out by using different commercially available
immobilized enzymes, evaluating the catalytic activity and the enantioselectivity under different experimental conditions. Re-use of
the most efficient enzyme was performed both in batch and in a semi-continuous system. The selected biocatalyst showed good
stability under the reaction conditions providing consistent results in terms of conversion and enantiomeric excess after several
cycles. The reported results may be of practical interest in view of the development of this sustainable approach to an industrial
scale.

Introduction
Enantiomerically pure amines are important precursors to bio-
logically active compounds with different industrial applica-
tions, including pharmaceuticals, fragrances and agricultural
products [1]. It is therefore important to develop methods for
their preparation which can be suitable for a large scale produc-
tion. In this context there is an increasing interest in reactions
including ω-transaminases (TAs) which have been identified as
a greener and more sustainable method for chiral amine produc-
tion [2-5]. TAs, also known as aminotransferases, are enzymes
capable of transferring an amino group from an amine donor to

an acceptor containing a carbonyl functionality in the presence
of pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP) as a cofactor and the enzymes
are easily regenerated in situ without the need for another en-
zyme. In principle, enantiomerically pure chiral amines can be
prepared following two approaches: through kinetic resolution
starting from racemic amines or by asymmetric synthesis
starting from suitable substrates, e.g., the corresponding carbon-
yl compounds. In a kinetic resolution, a maximum yield of 50%
of the product can be obtained. Moreover, high quantities of the
co-product might complicate the product separation and the
recovery of the chiral amine. Thus, the asymmetric synthesis is
generally preferable because a theoretically 100% yield of the
product is possible. However, this process is reversible and
therefore the conversion of the substrate is determined by how
much the equilibrium is shifted towards the formation of the
desired product. For this purpose two different strategies are
used: (i) removal of the co-product deriving from the amine
donor (i.e., under reduced pressure or by degradation/transfor-
mation) and (ii) use of an excess of the amine donor. The latter
method might have, however, some drawbacks: the recovery
and purification of the target amine can be difficult depending
on the nature of the amine donor used in excess and/or this
excess can cause inhibition of the enzyme. The use of iso-
propylamine (IPA) as amino donor allowed optimizing the use
of TAs in organic synthesis thanks to its ability to shift the
transamination reactions towards complete conversion together
with easy removal of the low boiling point byproduct acetone
[2-6].
Since (R)- and (S)-selective TAs are available on the market,
both enantiomers of the amine product are accessible. This
point is particularly relevant since in most cases the pharmaco-
logical activity of a chiral drug is closely related to its absolute
configuration. Recent studies have favored the application of
TAs at the industrial level, so it is not surprising that they are
frequently found among the enzymes designed for the large-
scale synthesis of chiral amines [2,4]. Moreover, immobiliza-
tion of TAs has been developed in order to increase stability,
enzyme recyclability, easy work-up and purification of the
product [2-4,7-13]. Recently, we have reported a successful use
of several immobilized TAs with IPA as amine donor [14].
Optically active 3-aminopiperidines and their N and/or N'-pro-
tected analogues, are important intermediates for the synthesis
of a large number of biologically active compounds used for the
treatment of obesity, type-I and II diabetes mellitus or as
psychotropic drugs against depression and schizophrenia
[15-19]. In particular (R)-3-amino-1-Boc-piperidine is a useful
precursor of compounds mainly used for the synthesis of dipep-
tidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors, such as alogliptin,
linagliptin and other antidiabetic agents [15,17]. Over the years,
numerous synthetic pathways were tested for the preparation of
3-aminopiperidine and its N-protected precursors in an opti-
cally active form by using resolution of racemic mixtures, prep-
aration from chiral precursors or asymmetric synthesis from
prochiral compounds [20-22].
In contrast, only few examples have been published on the syn-
thesis of this molecule through biotransformations [23,24]. In
these procedures TAs are used in commercial free form or iso-
lated from bacterial sources, both in kinetic resolution starting
from the corresponding racemic amine and in asymmetric syn-
thesis starting from the corresponding ketone. The first method,
although it proceeds with high enantioselectivity, is a kinetic
resolution and as a consequence is limited to 50% maximum
yield of the desired product. The second process employs non-
commercial enzymes which might be a limitation in the
perspective of a potential large-scale industrial application.
More recently, the synthesis of the (S)-enantiomer of minor ap-
plication interest has been described [25]. However, the en-
zyme used in this study is not commercially available and no
enantioselectivity of the reaction has been reported.
Herein, we describe the use of several immobilized ω-transami-
nases in the asymmetric transamination of the selected sub-
strate 1-Boc-3-piperidone. Selected reaction parameters were
studied to optimize the protocol for further scaling-up purposes.
Results and Discussion
In order to obtain enantiomerically pure (R)- and (S)-3-amino-1-
Boc-piperidine (2), the transamination reaction was studied by
using commercially available immobilized TAs (TAs-IMB) and
isopropylamine as the amine donor (Scheme 1).
 
Scheme 1: Transamination reaction of 1-Boc-3-piperidone (1).
These enzymes are covalently immobilized on an epoxyacry-
late resin and offer several advantages over the native ones,
especially in view of a large scale application. In addition to an
enhanced stability at higher temperatures or in organic solvents,
immobilization on the support allows an easy recovery of the
enzyme and isolation of the product after the reaction. More-
over, the activity of immobilized TAs used at appropriate con-
centrations can be comparable to that of the free enzymes [26].
The conditions for the application of these enzymes according
to the supplier protocol are: 50 mg of substrate (45 mM),

in triethanolamine buffer (100 mM, pH 7.5) in a total volume of

solution (15% v/v) can be used. These conditions were taken as
a starting point to evaluate the reactivity and stereoselectivity of
the enzymes in the transamination reaction of substrate 1 and
the results are reported in Table 1.

As can be seen in Table 1, ATA-025-IMB was the most effi-
cient among the (R)-selective enzymes since it led to high
conversion and enantiomeric excess in the shortest reaction time
(Table 1, entry 1). Accordingly, ATA-P1-G05-IMB was the
most efficient in order to obtain the (S)-enantiomer (Table 1,
entry 5).
In contrast, the (S)-selective enzymes ATA-260-IMB, ATA-
256-IMB and ATA-254 allowed for the formation of the prod-
uct with high enantioselectivity (>99%) but longer reaction
times were required to achieve high yields of up to 94%
(Table 1, entries 6, 7, and 8).
It should be noted that the TAs-IMB enzymes showed excellent
enantioselectivities as demonstrated by the enantiomeric excess
values which were all above 98%. Therefore, these results
represent an improvement in the preparation of enantiomerical-
ly pure 2 compared with literature data [23]. Höhne et al. ob-
tained only the (R)-enantiomer in 42% yield and 97% ee as a
result of kinetic resolution of 1 using ω-transaminase and pyru-
vate as an amine acceptor. The enantiomeric excess in entries 9
and 10 of Table 1 was not determined due to the presence of
several byproducts.
Transamination reactions using these optimized reaction condi-
tions with commercially available TAs-IMB have been per-
formed with other achiral [14] and pro-chiral [27] substrates,
such as for example 4-methoxyphenylacetone. It was found that
quantitative conversions were in some cases obtained only
with (S)-selective TAs, confirming that it is difficult to predict
the reactivity of the enzymes by changing the nature of the sub-
strate.
After these initial investigations at room temperature, four
promising enzymes were selected (i.e., three (R)-selective and
one (S)-selective) which allowed to obtain high conversions and
enantiomeric excesses in the transamination reaction of 1.
In order to enhance reaction rates, an optimization study
was undertaken within the stability range of the enzyme.
According to the supplier, the used TAs-IMB showed a higher
stability in the range between 30 °C and 55 °C when the model
compound acetophenone was used as substrate. We were
interested in exploring the behavior of these enzymes
using 1 as starting material. Transamination reactions
catalyzed by ATA-025-IMB, ATA-415-IMB, ATA-013-IMB,
and ATA-P1-G05-IMB were repeated under the same
experimental conditions described above with the exception
of a higher reaction temperature. The results are shown in
Table 2.

In all cases the increase in temperature resulted in a decrease in
reaction time compared to the reaction at room temperature
(Table 1). It should be noted that in all reactions the product
was obtained with high enantioselectivity (98% or higher).
Among the (R)-selective enzymes the best was ATA-025-IMB
as it gave in 3 hours at 50 °C 99% yield with >99% ee. ATA-
415-IMB and ATA-013-IMB were also sensitive to the temper-
ature effect; however, complete conversion of 1 was reached
with these enzymes at 50 °C in 24 and 28 hours, respectively.
The decrease in the reaction time observed with ATA-P1-G05-
IMB in the reactions carried out at 35 °C and at 50 °C with
respect to those at room temperature is particularly significant.
Nevertheless, the time necessary for complete conversion was
higher than that observed for (R)-selective enzymes at the same
temperature. From the obtained results of the investigation of
the temperature effect in the transamination reaction of 1 it was
concluded that TAs-IMB exhibited higher activities at higher
temperatures without loss of efficiency and selectivity.
Having in hand the good results obtained both in terms of activ-
ity and enantioselectivity, in particular with ATA-025-IMB at
50 °C, optimization of the reaction regarding the recycling of
the enzyme was studied. Indeed, one of the advantages of using
immobilized enzymes is the easy recovery of the enzyme at the
end of the reaction by simple filtration and its reuse in succes-
sive reactions.
As previously indicated, in the transamination reaction it is
necessary to use DMSO as a co-solvent to solubilize the sub-
strate 1, which is insoluble in an aqueous medium. In batch
recycling reactions, it was tested if the reused enzyme would be
partially deactivated after several reaction cycles in the pres-
ence of the organic solvent. Therefore, the amount of enzyme
was increased in order to reduce the reaction time and as a
consequence to limit the contact time of the enzyme with
DMSO. The enzymatic transamination reaction was carried out
as previously described at 50 °C but using 1 g of enzyme. At the
end of the reaction, the enzyme was filtered, washed and reused
in five consecutive reactions under the same experimental
conditions (Figure 1).
Under these experimental conditions, complete conversion was
obtained after 30 minutes of reaction in the first and in the
second cycle. In the following reactions, complete conversion
was reached after 1 hour. The enantiomeric excess of (R)-2 was
>99% in all cases. These results showed that ATA-025-IMB
can be reused in subsequent runs without loss of selectivity and
therefore looks promising for the development of a large-scale
reaction. Furthermore, it should be noted that the selected en-
zyme allowed obtaining the (R)-enantiomer which is of greater
industrial interest than the (S)-enantiomer.
 
Figure 1: Reuse of ATA-025-IMB in five consecutive cycles in the
transamination reaction of 1 in batch system (reaction time: 30 minutes
in cycles 1, and 2 and 1 hour in cycles 3–5; temperature: 50 °C).
The good results obtained in the batch recycling reactions
prompted us to investigate the possibility of a recycling process
under flow conditions. For this purpose a microreactor was built
consisting of a PEEK column which was filled with the en-
zyme. The reaction mixture was circulated within the reactor by
using a suitable pump. Both the PEEK column and the reaction
mixture were thermostated at a temperature of 50 °C. The
progress of the reaction was monitored with the same methods
used for the previously described reactions, by withdrawing
aliquots of the reaction mixture. After 4 hours, when a com-
plete conversion was achieved, the reaction was interrupted.
The reaction mixture was then removed and the column was
washed first with a 5% (v/v) aqueous solution of DMSO
in H2O/triethanolamine buffer at pH 7.5 followed by
H2O/triethanolamine buffer at pH 7.5 for the quantitative isola-
tion of the reaction product. The column was then used in five
consecutive reactions under the same experimental conditions.
The results are shown in Figure 2.
In all cycles, the same values of conversion and enantiomeric
excess as in the batch reactions were obtained. These results are
of interest for application as they show that the activity of the
enzyme was maintained even after several hours of continuous
operation at 50 °C in the presence of DMSO. It is also note-
worthy that when the reactor was stored at 4 °C and reused after
several months under the same experimental conditions for
further five runs on the substrate 1, no relevant changes in activ-
ity and selectivity were obtained.
In order to optimize the reaction, some scale-up tests were per-
formed using 200 mg of ATA-025-IMB and a substrate concen-
tration of 40 g/L. Compared to the reactions carried out with
smaller amounts of substrate, the reaction was slower which is
most likely due to low solubility of the starting material under
Beilstein J. Org. Chem. 2019, 15, 60–66.

these experimental conditions. After 24 hours, complete conver-
sion of 1 was obtained but in addition to the desired product
(R)-2 some byproducts were also observed, confirming possible
degradation of the substrate in aqueous media [25]. However,
(R)-2 was obtained in 70% isolated yield and >99% ee. Finally,
the product was converted into the corresponding dihydrochlo-
ride and compared with an authentic commercial sample in
order to confirm the enantiomeric excess and absolute configu-
ration.
Conclusion
Several (S)- and (R)-selective immobilized transaminases have
been investigated for the synthesis of a high added value chiral
amine from the corresponding commercial ketone employing
isopropylamine as amine donor. Due to the excellent enantiose-
lectivity of the selected enzymes, the target molecule could be
prepared with high yield and excellent enantiomeric excess. The
stability of the enzyme with respect to the temperature and the
organic solvent allowed its reuse both in batch and flow system.
Experimental
General
The chemicals used in this study were purchased from Sigma-
Aldrich, Fluka or Alfa Aesar and used as received unless other-
wise stated. An authentic sample of (R)-3-aminopiperidine
dihydrochloride was obtained from Cangzhou Senary Chemi-
cals S. & T. CO., LTD (China). Codex® ATA-IMB Screening
Kit was purchased from Purolite. The enzyme loading was
about 100 mg protein per gram of wet resin. 1H and 13C NMR
spectra were recorded at room temperature at the field indicat-
ed on a Bruker Avance II spectrometer. Multiplicities for
1H NMR couplings are shown as s (singlet), d (doublet),
m (multiplet). Chemical shifts (in ppm) are referenced to
residual protonated solvent. The optical rotations were
measured on an Anton Paar MCP 300 polarimeter. Thin-layer
chromatography (TLC) analyses were performed on silica gel
60 F254 plates using EtOAc/EtOH 1:1 as eluent and visual-
izing compounds by exposure to 0.2% ninhydrin solution and
UV light or I2 vapor. The transamination reactions were per-
formed in an Eppendorf ThermoMixer C which combines tem-
perature control and mixing.
Chromatographic analysis
Analyses of the reactions were performed on a Jasco HPLC
system with a Gemini C18 column (150 × 4.6 mm). Elution was
carried out at 1 mL/min with detection at 220 nm and a column
temperature of 25 °C. The eluent was H2O/CH3CN/DEA
70:30:0.1. Authentic standards were analyzed before analysis of
the reaction mixtures.
The enantiomeric excesses were determined after derivatization.
An aliquot (50 mg) of the crude sample and 100 mg K2CO3
were added to a 15 mL volumetric flask and dissolved in 1 mL
of CH3CN and 4 mL H2O. Benzyl chloroformate (100 μL) was
slowly added dropwise and the solution was sonicated for
5 minutes. After the addition of 1 mL ethyl acetate the solution
was sonicated for further 5 minutes and extracted with ethyl
acetate (1 mL). The organic phase was dried over Na2SO4,
filtered and after evaporation of the solvent diluted with the
mobile phase. Enantiomer separation was achieved on a Jasco
HPLC system and a Lux-Cellulose 3 (250 × 4.6 mm) column
with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min, detection at 216 nm and column
temperature of 25 °C. The eluent was hexane/isopropanol 9:1.
The racemic compound was used as reference. The absolute
configuration was assigned by comparison of elution order of
an authentic standard.
General procedure for the transamination reaction
with immobilized enzymes
In a similar manner as previously described in [14], to 5 mL of
a triethanolamine buffer (100 mM, pH 7.5) containing iso-
propylamine (1.1 M), TA-IMB enzyme (200 mg) and PLP
(1.4 mM) were added. The mixture was stirred at 35 °C and
550 rpm for 5 minutes, and then a preheated solution (35 °C) of
1-Boc-3-piperidone (1, 0.26 mmol, 45 mM) in DMSO (750 μL,
13% v/v) was added. The reaction was stirred at 35 °C and
550 rpm in an open vessel for 24 hours. The reaction was moni-
tored by HPLC analysis and by TLC. At the end of the reaction,
the enzyme was filtered under vacuum and washed with
triethanolamine buffer (100 mM, pH 7.5, 3 × 2 mL). The recov-
ered enzyme was suspended in buffer and stored at 4 °C. HCl
(4 M) was added to the reaction mixture to reach pH 2 and the
aqueous layer was extracted with CH2Cl2 (2 × 5 mL) to remove
any starting material. After that, the pH of the solution was
changed to pH 13 by addition of KOH and the aqueous layer

extracted with CH2Cl2 (4 × 5 mL). The combined organic
extracts were dried over Na2SO4, filtered and then evaporated
under reduced pressure to yield 3-amino-1-Boc-piperidine (2).
Each of the crude reaction mixtures were analyzed by NMR and
HPLC.
Reuse of immobilized TA in batch system
The transamination reaction of 1-Boc-3-piperidone (1) was con-
ducted using 1 g of ATA-025-IMB under the experimental
conditions described above. Upon complete conversion, the en-
zyme was filtered, washed with triethanolamine buffer
(100 mM, pH 7.5) and reused under the same reaction condi-
tions for five subsequent reactions. The reaction mixtures were
extracted and analyzed as described above.
General procedure for the transamination reaction
with immobilized TA in flow system
ATA-025-IMB (0.8 g) was packed into a PEEK column which
was then connected to a suitable pump. Triethanolamine buffer
(100 mM, pH 7.5) containing isopropylamine (1.1 M) and PLP
(1.4 mM) was circulated through the column at 35 °C, at a flow
rate of 4 mL/min prior to use. Then a preheated solution of
1-Boc-3-piperidone (1, 0.26 mmol, 45 mM) in DMSO (750 μL,
13% v/v) was added. The reaction mixture contained in an open
vessel was pumped through the column at 50 °C. The reaction
was monitored by HPLC analysis and TLC. Upon complete
conversion, the column was washed with triethanolamine buffer
(100 mM, pH 7.5) to quantitatively recover the product. The
column was stored at 4 °C. The eluted solution and washings
were extracted as described above. The column was reused in
five consecutive reactions under the same experimental condi-
tions.
Preparative scale transamination reaction with
immobilized TA
To 4 mL of triethanolamine buffer (100 M, pH 7.5) containing
isopropylamine (1.1 M) and PLP (1.4 mM) ATA-025-IMB en-
zyme (200 mg) was added. The mixture was stirred at 35 °C
and 550 rpm for 5 minutes, and then a preheated solution of
1-Boc-3-piperidone (1, 1.25 mmol, 208 mM) in DMSO (2 mL,
33% v/v) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at 50 °C,
550 rpm and monitored by HPLC analysis and TLC. Upon
complete conversion, the enzyme was filtered under vacuum
and the reaction mixture was worked up as described above.
After removal of the solvent of the combined organic phases
under reduced pressure, (R)-2 was obtained as a yellow oil with
70% isolated yield and >99% ee. 1H NMR (400 MHz, CDCl3) δ

Synthesis of (R)-3-aminopiperidine dihydrochloride
In a vial, 100 mg (0.5 mmol) of (R)-1-Boc-3-aminopiperidine
((R)-2, ee >99%) were dissolved in 100 μL EtOH. To the result-
ing solution, 400 μL of a solution of acetyl chloride (2.8 mmol)
in EtOH (1:1) was gradually added at 0 °C. The reaction mix-
ture was then stirred at room temperature. A white solid settled
down and indicated the completion of the reaction. The super-
natant was decanted and the solid was washed with cold ethanol
(2 × 100 μL). The solid was dried under vacuum to yield
