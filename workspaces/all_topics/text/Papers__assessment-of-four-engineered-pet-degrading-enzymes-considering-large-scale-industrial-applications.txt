ABSTRACT: In recent years, enzymatic recycling of the widely
used polyester polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has become a
complementary solution to current thermomechanical recycling for
colored, opaque, and mixed PET. A large set of promising
hydrolases that depolymerize PET have been found and enhanced
by worldwide initiatives using various methods of protein
engineering. Despite the achievements made in these works, it
remains difficult to compare enzymes’ performance and their
applicability to large-scale reactions due to a lack of homogeneity
between the experimental protocols used. Here, we pave the way for
a standardized enzymatic PET hydrolysis protocol using reaction
conditions relevant for larger scale hydrolysis and apply these
parameters to four recently reported PET hydrolases (LCC
ICCG
, FAST-PETase, HotPETase, and PES-H1
L92F/Q94Y
). We show that
FAST-PETase and HotPETase have intrinsic limitations that may not permit their application on larger reaction scales, mainly due
to their relatively low depolymerization rates. With 80% PET depolymerization, PES-H1
L92F/Q94Y
may be a suitable candidate for
industrial reaction scales upon further rounds of enzyme evolution. LCC
ICCG
outperforms the other enzymes, converting 98% of
PET into the monomeric products terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG) in 24 h. In addition, we optimized the reaction
conditions of LCC
ICCG
toward economic viability, reducing the required amount of enzyme by a factor of 3 and the temperature of
the reaction from 72 to 68 °C. We anticipate our findings to advance enzymatic PET hydrolysis toward a coherent assessment of the
enzymes and materialize feasibility at larger reaction scales.

INTRODUCTION
Despite the many benefits of synthetic polymers (plastics),
their inadequate end-of-life management is a global threat to
the environment, affecting ecosystems globally and posing a
serious health warning.
1−3
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is
one of the most important polymers in terms of volume and
accounts for 18% of the global plastic production.
4,5
Current
PET thermomechanical recycling strategies have significant
drawbacks,
6
such as limited waste sourcing (i.e., reliance on
transparent bottles) and a decrease in their mechanical
properties during the extrusion process. Consequently, more
sustainable solutions that are in line with a circular economy
are urgently needed. PET, composed of monomers linked by
ester bonds, can be enzymatically hydrolyzed, yielding the
products terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG),
which are suitable for a resynthesis of the polymer after their
purification. Nearly 20 years ago, the first hydrolase, a cutinase,
was shown to specifically depolymerize PET.
7,8
Since then,
many other hydrolases have been isolated and enhanced
through protein engineering.
4,9−11
In 2020, leaf-branch
compost cutinase (LCC
12
) was engineered into a quadruple
variant called LCC
ICCG
to meet industrial requirements.
13
This
study showed that monomers obtained through enzymatic
hydrolysis under industry-relevant conditions could be purified
and reused to obtain virgin PET, paving the way for the
industrial deployment of enzyme-based PET depolymerization.
Recently, FAST-PETase
14
and HotPETase,
11
two engineered
variants of the poorly thermostable IsPETase
15
from the
bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis, were reported to show better
PET hydrolyzing performances than LCC
ICCG
. Last, PES-
H1
L92F/Q94Y
, a double variant of a metagenome-derived
cutinase, was also shown to be a promising candidate for the
deployment of enzyme-based PET recycling solutions.

direct comparison of the catalytic performances and potentials
for larger scale applications remained very limited since the
experimental parameters of all of these studies were widely
different. Moreover, to adequately translate these enzymatic
performances into a relevant large-scale industrial deployment,
a list of key parameters should also be considered.
4,17,18
Such
key parameters are (i) PET crystallinity and associated
pretreatment, (ii) surface of exchange and associated pretreat-
ment, (iii) temperature of the enzyme-based PET depolyme-
rization accounting for Arrhenius’ law, polymer’s glass
transition temperature (T
g
), thermal induced crystallization,
and enzyme thermostability, (iv) enzyme catalytic efficiency, to

compete with PET crystallization kinetics, (v) PET concen-
tration in the reactor, (vi) yield of the enzyme-based PET
depolymerization, (vii) composition of the final products, and
(viii) enzyme expressability (Table 1). The characteristics of
PET used, its molar mass, its crystallinity, and the presence of
comonomers such as isophthalic acid (IPA),
4
as well as the
shape and size of the degraded PET object (e.g., film or
powder with a given particle size) are decisive factors. Many
studies have demonstrated that PET hydrolases preferentially
act on the amorphous regions of PET,
19−21
and to the best of
our knowledge, no PET hydrolases have been reported to act
efficiently on highly crystalline forms of the polymer, typically
found in consumer products.
4,22
It thus appears crucial to
perform a feedstock pretreatment to transform semicrystalline
PET to its amorphous state in order to reach the high level of
PET conversion (>90%) necessary to meet techno-economic
goals
23
and to meet process-based life cycle assessment of
virgin PET production
24
(Table 1). Another key parameter is
the exchange surface between the solid plastic and the enzyme.
The finer the particle size of the plastic powder, the faster the
depolymerization kinetics will be.
25−27
Such pretreatment
appears mandatory for the industrial deployment of a PET
recycling process in order to achieve high kinetics and yields,
28
even if it has a negative impact on both capital and operational
expenditures (CAPEX and OPEX)
23
(Table 1). Enzyme
thermostability is also a crucial parameter to attain high
productivity, as, beyond the effect of the Arrhenius’ law, a high
reaction temperature near the T
g
increases the mobility of
polymer chains
29−34
(Table 1). However, two competing key
events take place close to the T
g
: the kinetics of PET hydrolysis
and the kinetics of PET recrystallization, the latter being
counterproductive for efficient depolymerization. Thus, a
thermostable enzyme must have sufficient catalytic efficiency
to compete with the recrystallization rates (Table 1). Another
important aspect of enzyme-based PET depolymerization on
an industrial scale is that hydrolysis will not be performed in a
dedicated buffered system but in water, mainly to simplify
downstream processing but also to minimize OPEX.
Evaluation of engineered enzymes’ performances should
therefore be performed at low salt concentrations. Also, pH
regulation is mandatory to ensure stable catalytic performance
around enzymes’ pH optima (e.g., pH 7 to 9) and will be
ensured by the addition of a base (e.g., NaOH) to neutralize
the acidic products released during PET depolymerization
(e.g., the diacid TPA and the monoacid MHET). Such base
addition will lead to the formation of soluble disodium
terephthalate, which will be recovered for further TPA
purification. Maximization of the productivity per batch
requires a high initial concentration of PET waste. This latter
is dictated (taking into account base addition, transformation
of PET solid polymer into two water-soluble products, and
water addition for postreaction treatment) by the solubility of
this terephthalate salt which is around 13% (w/w) between 25
and 70 °C.
35
If the terephthalate salt solubility is exceeded,
precipitated disodium terephthalate will be mixed with other
insoluble products (remaining PET and other solid contam-
inants), rendering its recovery difficult. Additionally, consider-
ing the high price of PET waste and the cost of postreactional
waste treatment, a minimum PET conversion of 90% (ideally
95%) must be reached to meet the expectations of an
economically viable industrial recycling process
28
(Table 1).
This high PET conversion must lead to the exclusive
formation of TPA and EG while avoiding the accumulation of
intermediate products (e.g., MHET) that would be lost during
the purification scheme if a dedicated postdepolymerization
treatment is not amended
14
(Table 1). Finally, high enzyme
expressability (e.g., >20 g L
−1
of extracellular protein) is crucial
when operating an industrial unit, mainly for OPEX
considerations, but only a few industrial contractors can
achieve an appreciable expression yield using dedicated
industrial hosts (Table 1). This specific aspect of enzyme
expressability could not be assessed in our study and remains
difficult to predict.
Taking all these industrial key parameters into consideration,
we evaluated the performances of four recently reported
pioneering PET hydrolases, which are LCC
ICCG
,
13
FAST-
PETase,
14
HotPETase,
11
and PES-H1
L92F/Q94Y
.
16
First, their
respective PET depolymerization performances were evaluated
using a standardized substrate (micronized amorphous Good-
fellow film) at five different reaction temperatures matching
the optimum conditions reported in the corresponding studies.
Furthermore, larger scale setups using amorphized micronized
postconsumer PET bottle flakes were implemented as a proof
of principle for economic feasibility. We found that FAST-
PETase and HotPETase performances were markedly
deteriorated once evaluated in the industrial-process-rele-
vant−experimental setup used here and that LCC
ICCG
outperformed all other enzymes tested. We conclude that a
standardization of experimental reaction parameters of
enzymatic PET degradation, as provided in this article, is
advisable to advance enzymatic PET hydrolysis toward
industrial applications.

RESULTS
Standardized Assay to Evaluate Performances of
Four Engineered PET Degrading Enzymes. Numerous
strategies have successfully been developed to improve PET
hydrolase performances in heterogeneous systems. Never-
theless, there is still a lack of a standardized approach to
rationalize the kinetics of these interfacial enzymes, therefore
hampering fundamental and comparative descriptions of PET-
hydrolases.
36
Amorphous Goodfellow film is a commercially
available substrate suitable to compare enzyme performances.
Exchange surface is a key parameter for the efficient hydrolysis
of PET, and several PET hydrolases have shown very poor
performances on amorphous PET film compared to
amorphous PET powder.
22
Consequently, cryo-ground Good-
fellow films sieved under 500 μm (Gf-PET) appear as good
candidates for further enzymatic reactions. Comparative
performance assessments were performed using an initial
PET concentration of 2 g
PET
L
−1
(e.g., 100 mg of Gf-PET in 50
mL) in a low ionic strength buffer but sufficient to keep a
stable pH over a theoretically full PET conversion, where 10.4
mM of TPA would be released. To facilitate the evaluation of
the four different biocatalysts studied here (LCC

(91.7 °C). As mentioned above, it is very
important to perform PET depolymerization at a high
temperature, close to the T

of PET which is near 70 °C

in aqueous solution. Enzymes’ performances were evaluated
at low (nonsaturating) enzyme concentration (0.2 mg

g
PET

) using 2 g
PET
L
−1
and at five temperatures to match the
optimal temperature range reported in the literature for each
enzyme (e.g., 45, 50, 60, 65, and 68 °C). The maximal
temperature of 68 °C was chosen to avoid PET recrystalliza-
tion, which impedes enzymatic PET hydrolysis for all known
enzymes. In the light of the literature, performances of FAST-
PETase, PES-H1
L92F/Q94Y
, and LCC
ICCG
were evaluated using
0.1 M phosphate buffer at pH 8.0 while performances of
HotPETase were monitored using 0.05 M glycine−OH buffer
at pH 9.2, as reported in the earlier study.
11,13,14,16
Kinetics of
PET depolymerization were assessed using UV absorbance
analysis, where all soluble products released during PET
depolymerization (e.g., TPA, MHET, BHET, and longer
soluble oligomers) can be accounted for. The results of these
PET depolymerizations are shown in Figure 1a−d and the
assessed enzymes’ specific activities (SA) are shown in Figure
1e.
FAST-PETase has a SA of 246 μmol

when PET depolymerization is performed at 45 °C and
exhibited its highest SA at 50 °C, (348 μmol

) (Figure 1e and Table S2) where the reaction
reached a PET conversion of 10% of hydrolysis after 24 h
before stopping the reaction (Figure 1a and Table S2). When
PET depolymerization was performed at 60 °C and above,
FAST-PETase suffered from its low thermostability and
appeared to be destabilized very rapidly, with no significant
activity detected. As expected for a more thermostable enzyme,
the SA of HotPETase was improved from 211 μmol

at 45 °C up to 1351 μmol

at 65
°C (Figure 1e and Table S2). However, while 25% substrate
conversion was achieved at 60 °C, only 12% was reached at 65
°C, reflecting HotPETases’ low stability at temperatures higher
than 60 °C (Figure 1b and Table S2). Likewise, PES-

showed its highest SA at 65 °C (481 μmol

) (Figure 1e and Table S2), and depolymerization
stopped rapidly at temperatures higher than 60 °C (Figure 1c).
While the reaction stopped after 9 h to reach 7% PET
depolymerization at 65 °C, it was able to run over 24 h at 60
°C to reach 11% PET conversion. Finally, LCC

showed its

and Table S2), and its overall stability allowed the reaction to
proceed over 48 h at 68 °C (Figure 1d), where PET
conversion reached 46% (Table S2). From this first perform-
ance evaluation, we decided to use each enzyme under its best
temperature condition (e.g., 50 °C for FAST-PETase, 60 °C
for HotPETase and PES-H1
L92F/Q94Y
, and 68 °C for LCC
ICCG
)
to reassess the enzyme performances under an upscaled PET
depolymerization assay, including the new constraints
previously described.
Performances of the PET Hydrolases under Larger
Scale Bioreactor Conditions. Gf-PET appears to be an
appropriate uniform PET substrate accessible to everyone to
perform a comparative evaluation of PET hydrolases through
SA and stability studies. Nevertheless, it is of great interest to
further corroborate these initial performances by conducting
enzyme-based depolymerization on a larger scale (e.g., in a 0.5
L bioreactor) using a significant amount of postconsumer
waste polymer (PcW-PET). Even though postconsumer bottle
flakes are readily available globally from various suppliers, these
PET samples can be produced by crushing a mix of water,
soda, milk, or cosmetics bottles. Still, this crushed material is
highly crystalline (typically 30−40% crystallinity), which
makes it recalcitrant to enzymatic hydrolysis. A suitable
amorphous material was obtained by rapidly cooling previously
melted PET pellets in an extruder at 265 °C and cryogrinding
them into sieved PET powder with a particle size of less than
500 μm.
5
The investment expenditure (CAPEX) dedicated to the
depolymerization section mainly relies on the productivity of
the PET depolymerization, expressed in grams of products
released per liter and per hour. This productivity is a function
of three parameters: (i) the concentration of PET waste, (ii)
the kinetics of the reaction, and (iii) the final conversion of
PET and hence the yield of TPA and EG recovered, as
underlined by a life cycle assessment study of enzymatic PET
recycling.
24
To maximize batch productivity, we aimed for a
maximum PET loading in the reactor while ensuring that the
disodium terephthalate generated would remain soluble.
Considering the disodium terephthalate solubility (13% w/
w),
35
the addition of a 20% (w/w) NaOH solution for pH
regulation and the transformation of PET solid polymer into
two water-soluble products, the initial PET waste concen-
tration can be set at 15.5% (w/w). However, within an
industrial facility, an additional water volume must be
considered to clean the reactor, to flush circuits from the
reactor to the filter, and to wash the postreaction filtrate. Two
loadings of PET were then tested: 16.5% (w/w) and 20% (w/
w), considering a post reaction addition of water of 3.5 and
20%, respectively.
Considering the enzymes’ performances described previ-
ously, 16.5% (w/w) PcW-PET depolymerizations were
performed at 50 °C when using FAST-PETase, 60 °C for
HotPETase and PES-H1
L92F/Q94Y
, and 68 °C for LCC
ICCG
(Figure 2, Table S3). PET substrate conversion reached 15%
after 24 h using FAST-PETase at 50 °C (Table S3), but the
PET depolymerization rate slowed down considerably very
early on (2 h after the beginning of the reaction), indicating
insufficient stability of this enzyme even at 50 °C (Figure 2).
Consequently, while Fast-PETase has a maximum productivity
of 13.5 g
TPAeq
L
−1
h
−1
, the average productivity is only 0.9
g
TPAeq
L
−1
h
−1
over 24 h (Table 2). Likewise, HotPETase was
able to achieve 26% PET conversion in 24 h at 60 °C, but its
activity deteriorated after 2 to 3 h of reaction time (Figure 2
Figure 2. Comparison of 16.5% (w/w) PcW-PET depolymerizations performed by the four enzymes at bioreactor scale. Enzyme-based PET
depolymerizations were performed using FAST-PETase at 50 °C, pH 8.0 (orange), HotPETase at 60 °C, pH 9.2 (red), PES-H1

titrate, 1 mol of the monoacid MHET).

can be estimated, but it decreases to an average productivity of
1.57 g
TPAeq
L

h
−1
over 24 h (Table 2). Despite all efforts
devoted to the evolution of IsPETase, it appears that this
enzyme still suffers from an intrinsic lack of (thermo)stability,
and the catalytic properties of HotPETase, including product
inhibition, are still not aligned with the requirements for its
implementation in an enzyme-based PET depolymerization
process on the industrial scale. In contrast, the 80% PET
conversion obtained after 24 h (96% after 48 h) when using
PES-H1
L92F/Q94Y
at 60 °C (Figures 2, S3 and Table S3)
emphasizes continuous enzyme performance when increasing
the scale of the PET depolymerization assay. A maximum
productivity of 15.5 g
TPAeq
L
−1
h
−1
can be estimated as well as
an average productivity of 4.75 g
TPAeq
L
−1
h
−1
over 24 h (Table
2). Last, the highest efficiency in PET depolymerization was
observed for LCC
ICCG
converting 97% of the PET introduced
into TPA and EG in 24 h (Figure 2 and Table S3) with an
average productivity of 5.8 g
TPAeq
L
−1
h
−1
and a maximum
productivity of 28.6 g
TPAeq
L
−1
h
−1
(Table 2).
Notably, during the first hours of the reaction, MHET
represents a significant amount of the degradation products
(Figure 2 and Table S3). After around 3 h of reaction time
using FAST-PETase, HotPETase, PES-H1
L92F/Q94Y
, and
LCC
ICCG
, MHET accounts for 58, 21, 57, and 43% of the
acidic products released (e.g., the diacid TPA and the
monoacid MHET), respectively. Conversely, after 24 h, TPA
becomes predominant and represents 64, 100, 78, and 100% of
the soluble acidic products released, respectively. At 48 h,
MHET represents only 1% of the total products released by
PES-H1
L92F/Q94Y
. Using these values, and considering that 2
mol NaOH is used to neutralize 1 mol TPA while 1 mol
NaOH is used to neutralize 1 mol MHET, 18.1, 26.4, 90.1, and
97.3% PET conversion were effectively reached after 24 h for
FAST-PETase, HotPETase, PES-H1
L92F/Q94Y
, and LCC
ICCG
,
respectively (Figures 2, S3 and Table S3), and 96.2% was
reached after 48 h for PES-H1
L92F/Q94Y
. These values agree
with PET conversion calculated from the residual dry weight
assessment performed at the end of the reaction (Table S3)
(18.6, 28.7, 98.6, and 98.1% when using FAST-PETase,
HotPETase, PES-H1
L92F/Q94Y
, and LCC
ICCG
, respectively).
Interestingly, when considering the whole reaction using
LCC
ICCG
at 68 °C, we noticed that 58 and 79% PET
conversion can be achieved in only 3 and 6 h, respectively,
illustrating that the last 18 h of the PET depolymerization is
mostly dedicated to MHET hydrolysis. This MHET hydrolysis
can be catalyzed by the enzyme, but it was also demonstrated
to be due to its spontaneous hydrolysis.
44
Such instability of
the MHET might also be accelerated when PET depolyme-
rization is performed at a higher pH, as it is the general rule for
ester hydrolysis
45
and could explain the lack of MHET
accumulation observed during the PET depolymerization at
pH 9.2 using HotPETase.
At 20% PcW-PET loading, the overall behavior is like the
one observed at 16.5% for the four enzymes (Figures S4 and
S5, Tables S4 and S5). With the exception of PES-H1
L92F/Q94Y
,
the increase in productivity is linear between the two PET
loadings. For PES-H1
L92F/Q94Y
, the productivity is slightly
decreasing between 16.5 and 20% loading (from 4.8 to 4.4

at 24 h; from 2.8 to 2.7 g

at 48 h).

DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS
In the past few years, numerous publications dealing with the
discovery and engineering of PET hydrolases have been
released. To improve the activity and thermostability of such
PETases, various concepts of protein engineering were
implemented, such as rational design,
13
directed evolution,
11
or AI-assisted in silico protein design.
14
The field has greatly
benefited from these studies, since they have opened a plethora
of new possible avenues for enzymatic PET recycling.
Unfortunately, a thorough comparison of enzyme performance
remains problematic since no international scientific consensus
for the evaluation of PET hydrolase performance has emerged.
The nature and properties of the substrates used can differ as
well as reaction conditions, analytical methods, and more
importantly readout parameters. In our study, we targeted over
90% (ideally 95%) PET depolymerization from the perspective
of a viable large-scale biotechnological process development.
We postulated that studies solely relying on enzyme specific
activity as readouts were unable to assess the true applicability
of the enzymes for industrial deployment. One of the reasons is
very likely the number of new constraints to be considered on
a larger scale. As a first step, we have therefore performed a
standardized small-scale PET depolymerization study of four
engineered PET hydrolases (e.g., FAST-PETase,
14
HotPE-
Tase,

optimal temperature condition. Such standardization com-
prised the use of cryo-ground amorphous commercial
Goodfellow film with known particle size distribution, a fixed
enzyme/substrate ratio (mg
enzyme
g
PET
−1
), and a fixed polymer
concentration (g
PET
L
−1
). Enzymes’ performances were
evaluated at such small scale by determining standardized
parameters such as final PET conversion/terephthalic acid
formed after a given time and enzyme-specific activity values
(μmol

Then, a thorough comparison of
the four PET hydrolases was performed in bioreactors using
high concentrations of pretreated postconsumer PET waste
material (165 and 200 g
PET
kg
−1
) to mimic the conditions of
an industrial process. Parameters such as the average and
maximum productivity (expressed in g
TPAeq
L
−1
h
−1
), the PET
conversion/terephthalic acid formed after a given time, and the
purity of the products (e.g., TPA, MHET) were carefully
assessed. We find that a typical weakness of the PET degrading
enzymes is the deterioration of the activity over a long−time
reaction that is in turn required to achieve 100% substrate
conversion. FAST-PETase showed convincing performances in
terms of specific activities at both reactor scales, but the
kinetics of PET conversion in the reactor dramatically slowed
down to reach less than 20% at 24 h. This observation appears
to be in-line with the previous study where FAST-PETase
enabled a 90% PET depolymerization from a 45 g
PET

solution (e.g., amorphized PET bottle flakes) after 14 days at
50 °C but necessitating a daily replenishing of fresh enzyme

solution (i.e., replacing the entire reaction solution) to
compensate for the low stability of the enzyme.
14
HotPETase,
a more thermostable variant of the IsPETase, can achieve a
higher conversion of 26% at 24 h. Likewise, Bell et al. have
shown a substantial decrease in PET conversion after 5 h of
reaction using HotPETase correlated to enzyme deactivation
but not to product inhibition or PET.
11
Comparatively, PES-
H1
L92F/Q94Y
and LCC
ICCG
appeared more stable over time in
reactor conditions, and near-complete PET conversions
(∼98%) were attained within 48 and 24 h, respectively, at
16.5% PET loading (81 and 98% PET conversion at 20% PET
loading, respectively). LCC
ICCG
and PES-H1
L92F/Q94Y
thus
appear as good candidates for the deployment of an enzyme-
based-PET-depolymerization process.
The behavior of PES-H1
L92F/Q94Y
in the reactor is intriguing.
Its T
m
is lower than that of HotPETase (77.6 and 80.7,
respectively) and in small reactors, at low PET concentration,
and in nonsaturating enzyme conditions, the reaction stops
rapidly at less than 12% conversion. This contradiction cannot
be simply explained by low stability or inhibition by the
products. Further investigations are necessary to solve this
mystery.
Since the last study describing LCC
ICCG
performance,
13
reaction conditions have been largely improved in this work.
While 95% PET conversion was previously obtained after 24 h
using 3 mg
enzyme
g
PET
−1
at 72 °C,
13
98% PET conversion was
obtained here by introducing 1 mg
enzyme
g
PET
−1
at 68 °C.
Reducing the temperature of the reaction by 4 °C enabled the
PET recrystallization kinetics to be reduced, which favors
obtaining high conversion. The positive outcome was a
reduction of the amount of enzyme by a factor of 3 while
increasing the final PET conversion in the same time frame
and consequently decreasing the cost of waste treatment. Such
enzyme performance is meeting one of the bottlenecks
described in a comprehensive LCA study of enzymatic
recycling of PET, highlighting the need to achieve conversions
greater than 90% at high PET concentrations to minimize
postreaction waste.
24,28
Finally, TPA and EG monomers are
exclusively produced without the accumulation of MHET in
the solution, simplifying the purification scheme of the
products.
We believe that our study of PET hydrolases will contribute
to finding a consensus on the methods used and key
parameters to consider when performing a large-scale PET
depolymerization. Such a consensus is necessary for the
deployment of the first generation of enzymatic PET recycling
processes at an industrial scale. We also believe that this field
will further benefit from new technologies to emerge as well as
new superior enzymes being able, for instance, to perform
efficient degradation of semicrystalline PET to minimize the
PET pretreatment steps as underlined in a previous study.
28
Ultimately, new acid-tolerant PET hydrolases able to perform
efficient PET depolymerization with no (or a minimal) need of
soda for pH regulation would also be of great interest to
further strengthen the concept of enzymatic PET hydrolysis in
the frame of a circular economy.

acid sequences of the genes used in the study is provided in the
Supporting Information.
Preparative Protein Production. Genes were expressed
in E. coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells (New England Biolabs,
Ipswich, USA) by cultivation in ZYM auto-inducible medium
46
for 23 h at 21 °C. The E. coli cells were harvested by
centrifugation (6000g, 10 min, 10 °C) and suspended in lysis
buffer (20 mM Tris−HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl). Cells were
disrupted by sonication on ice, and the lysate was clarified by
centrifugation (10,000g, 30 min, 10 °C). The soluble fraction
was applied to TALON metal affinity resin (Clontech, CA).
After unbound proteins were washed with the lysis buffer
supplemented by 10 mM imidazole, bound proteins were
eluted with elution buffer (20 mM Tris−HCl, pH 8.0, 300 mM
NaCl, 250 mM imidazole). The buffer was finally exchanged
for storage buffer (100 mM potassium phosphate, pH 8.0 for
LCC
ICCG
, FAST-PETase, and PES-H1
L92F/Q94Y
or 50 mM
glycine−OH buffer pH 9.2 for HotPETase) using Hiprep 26/
10 desalting column (GE healthcare, Chicago, IL). Purified
protein concentration was determined based on the calculated
molar extinction coefficient at 280 nm. Protein purity was
evaluated by SDS−PAGE analysis.
Analytical Method for Melting Temperature Assess-
ment. DSF was used to assess the thermostability of LCC
ICCG
,
FAST-PETase, HotPETase, and PES-H1
L92F/Q94Y
by determin-
ing their melting temperature (T
m
). Protein samples were
prepared at a concentration of 6.25 μM and stored in buffer
consisting of potassium phosphate (pH 8.0, 100 mM) for
LCC
ICCG
, FAST-PETase, and PES-H1
L92F/Q94Y
, or in glycine−
OH buffer 50 mM, pH 9.2 for HotPETase. The SYPRO
Orange dye 5000× stock solution in DMSO was first diluted to
250× in water. Protein samples were loaded onto a white clear
96-well PCR plate (Lifescience Bio-Rad, France, catalog no.
HSP9601) with each well containing a final volume of 25 μL.
The final concentration of protein and SYPRO Orange dye in
each well was 6 μM and 10×, respectively. Loaded volumes per
well were as follows: 24 μL of the 6.25 μM protein solution
and 1 μL of the 250× SYPRO Orange diluted solution. The
PCR plates were then sealed with optical-quality sealing tape
and spun at 2000 rpm for 1 min at room temperature. DSF
experiments were then carried out using a Bio-Rad CFX96
real-time PCR system set on the FRET channel to use the
450/490 excitation and 560/580 emission filters. The samples
were heated from 25 to 100 °C at the rate of 0.3 °C s

single fluorescence measurement was taken every 0.03 s. The

PET Depolymerization Assay Using Amorphous
Goodfellow Film as Substrate. A 49 mL aliquot of
potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0, 100 mM) or glycine−
OH buffer (pH 9.2, 50 mM) was combined with 100 mg of Gf-
PET in a 100 mL glass bottle and incubated at 45, 50, 60, 65,
or 68 °C in a stirring dry bath 15−100 (2mag AG, Munich,
Germany) under agitation at 200 rpm until the solution
reached the desired temperature. The depolymerization was
initiated by adding 1 mL of a 0.02 mg
enzyme

(0.7 μM of

) in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, pH
8.0 for LCC
ICCG
, FAST-PETase, and PES-H1
L92F/Q94Y
, or in
glycine−OH buffer 50 mM, pH 9.2 for HotPETase. Samples
were harvested at 2, 4, 6, 9, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h of reaction
time and analyzed by ultraviolet light (UV) absorbance
measurements at 242 nm for the determination of PET
depolymerization kinetics (see below). Reactions were
performed in triplicate.
PET Depolymerization Assay in a Bioreactor. PET
depolymerization reactions at 20% PET (w/w) were
performed using 49 mg of purified protein (1.7 μmol)
prepared in 195 mL of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0,
100 mM) or glycine−OH buffer (pH 9.2, 50 mM) that was
combined with 50 g of PcW-PET (98% purity). PET
depolymerization reactions at 16.5% PET (w/w) were
performed using 40.43 mg of purified protein (1.4 μmol)
prepared in 203.75 mL of potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0,
100 mM) or glycine−OH buffer (pH 9.2, 50 mM) that were
combined with 41.25 g of PcW-PET (98% purity). Reactions
were performed in a 500 mL Benchtop F1 0.5 MB Bioreactor
(AD Biotec, France). Temperature regulation was performed
in the water-jacketed bioreactor, and a double Rushton
impeller was used to maintain constant agitation at 800 rpm.
The pH value was regulated to pH 8.0 or 9.2 by the addition of
a 20% NaOH (w/w) solution using the ROSITA 2.0 software
(AD Biotec, France). The kinetics of the PET depolymeriza-
tion was followed based on NaOH consumption, considering
the exclusive production of TPA and EG. Terephthalic acid has
two carboxylic acid groups; therefore, 1 mol of NaOH titrates
0.5 mol of terephthalic acid. Thus, the conversion of PET to
terephthalic acid can be easily calculated from the amount of
NaOH consumed. In addition, samples were harvested at
different time points and analyzed by UHPLC (see below) to
adjust PET conversion overtime by considering the TPA/
MHET ratio (1 mol of NaOH is consumed to titrate 1 mol of
the monoacid MHET). The final yield of the PET
depolymerization assay was determined either by NaOH
consumption or by dry weight determination of residual PET.
To determine dry weight of residual PET, the entire reaction
solution, including solid particles, was filtered through a 12 to
15 μm grade 11 ashless paper filter (Dutscher SAS, Brumath,
France) and dried. Maximum productivities in g

were estimated from a linear time frame of the NaOH

Tase, PES-H1

.
Quantification of Soluble Products Using Ultraviolet
Light Absorbance. Kinetics of Gf-PET enzymatic depolyme-
rization were followed by UV light absorbance using a method
adapted from Zhong-Johnson et al.
47
Briefly, the absorbance of
the reaction mixtures in the ultraviolet region of the light
spectrum (at 242 nm) indicates the release of soluble TPA or
its esters (MHET, BHET, and others) from the insoluble PET
substrate. Standard curves of TPA, MHET, and BHET were
performed at 242 nm using an Eon Microplate Spectropho-
tometer (BioTek, USA). An average coefficient of 16,400 M
−1
cm
−1
corresponding to a combination of these products was
used. Samplings performed at different times (typically at 2, 4,
6, 9, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h) during the hydrolysis of Gf-PET
were analyzed by absorbance reading at 242 nm. If necessary,
samples were diluted in potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0,
100 mM). The absorbance value is used to calculate the overall
sum of soluble PET hydrolysis products according to the
Lambert−Beer law. The SA of PET hydrolysis in μmol
TPAeq
h
−1
mg
enzyme
−1
was determined in the linear part (typically
between 0 and 4 h reaction time) of the hydrolysis curve of the
reaction. Alternatively, when enzymes suffered from poor
thermostability, specific activity was determined between 0 and
2 h of reaction time. The term TPA
eq
corresponds to the sum
of soluble products released from the hydrolysis the PET
polymer (e.g., TPA, MHET, BHET, and longer soluble
oligomers).
Analytical Method for TPA, MHET, and BHET
Detection by UHPLC. The concentrations of TPA, MHET,
and BHET were monitored by UHPLC. When required,
samples were diluted in potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0,
100 mM). Then, 150 μL of methanol and 6.5 μL of HCl 6 N
were added to 150 μL of a (diluted) sample. After
homogenization and filtering through a 0.45 μm syringe filter,
20 μL of the sample was injected into a UHPLC column. The
chromatography system used was a Vanquish UHPLC system
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) equipped with a
pump module, an autosampler, a column oven thermostated at
25 °C, and a UV detector at 240 nm. TPA, MHET, and BHET
were separated using a gradient of methanol (30 to 90%) in 1
mM H
2
S0
4
at 1 mL min
−1
through a Discovery HS C18 HPLC
column (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm) equipped with a
precolumn (Supelco, Bellefonte, PA). TPA, MHET, and
BHET were quantified according to standard curves, prepared
from commercial TPA and BHET (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) and in-house synthesized MHET,
13
under the same
conditions as for the samples.
