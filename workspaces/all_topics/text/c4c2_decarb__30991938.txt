Abstract
Background: C4 plants have been classified into three subtypes based on the enzymes used to decarboxylate C4
acids in the bundle sheath cells (NADP-ME, NAD-ME and PEPCK pathways). Evidences indicate that, depending on
environmental factors, C4 plants may exhibit a certain degree of flexibility in the use of the decarboxylation
mechanisms. In this context, the objective was to extend the knowledge on the degree of flexibility between the
pathways of decarboxylation in sugarcane, a NADP-ME species, at different levels of water deficit.
Results: An experiment was carried out with two cultivars - RB92579 (tolerant to water deficit) and SP80 –3280
(susceptible to water deficit) subjected to moderate level ( − 1.5 to − 1.8 MPa), severe level (below − 2.0 MPa) and
recovery (48 h after rehydration) and changes in the activities of the enzymes involved in the three C4 mechanisms
and in gene expression were investigated. Our results showed that sugarcane uses the PEPCK pathway as a
decarboxylation mechanism in addition to the NADP-ME, which was more evident under water deficit conditions
for both cultivars.
Conclusions: The results obtained here, show that sugarcane increases the use of the PEPCK pathway as a
decarboxylation mechanism, in addition to the NADP-ME pathway, under conditions of water deficit, particularly in
the tolerant cultivar.

Background
Sugarcane, like other species classified as having C4
photosynthetic pathways, developed anatomical and
physiological adaptations to optimize CO 2 fixation for
carbohydrate synthesis [ 1]. Plants of the C4 photosyn-
thetic pathway are grouped in three biochemical
subtypes, according to whether they contained high
levels of NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME, EC 1.1.1.40),
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK, EC
4.1.1.49) or NAD-malic enzyme (NAD-ME, EC 1.1.1.39)
for the decarboxylation of the C4 acids. The
decarboxylation in the bundle sheath cells can occur in
distinct cellular compartments, since NADP-ME occurs
in chloroplasts, NAD-ME in mitochondria, whereas
PEPCK exhibits cytosolic activity [ 2]. Currently, sugar-
cane is classified as a NADP-ME subtype [ 3].
CO2 is initially fixed in the mesophyll cells by phos-
phoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), a common enzyme
in all three in C4 subtypes (Additional file 1: Figure S1).
The product formed is oxaloacetate (OAA), which can
be either reduced to malate by the NADP-dependent
malate dehydrogenase (NADP-MDH) or converted to
aspartate by the aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT). In
the NADP-ME subtype, the malate is transported to the
bundle sheath cells where it is converted to pyruvate, re-
leasing CO 2. Next, pyruvate returns to the mesophyll

cells and the orthophosphate pyruvate dikinase (PPDK)
catalyzes the formation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP).
In the NAD-ME and PEPCK subtypes, aspartate is trans-
ported to the bundle sheath cells and converted back
into OAA in the mitochondria and cytosol, respectively.
In the NAD-ME subtype, OAA is reduced to malate by
NADP-MDH, and then NAD-ME catalyzes the oxidative
conversion of malate into pyruvate, releasing CO 2 into
the mitochondria [ 4, 5].
In the PEPCK subtype, most of the OAA is converted
into PEP by the enzyme PEPCK and CO 2 is released in
the cytosol of the bundle sheath cells. The NAD-ME
enzyme provides the reducing equivalents as NADH for
the generation of ATP for the PEPCK reaction. The
resulting pyruvate can be converted to alanine by the
enzyme alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT), which returns
to the mesophyll cells (Additional file 1:F i g u r eS 1 )
[4, 5]. Whether PEPCK is an independent biochemical
subtype or whether it is essentially similar to
NAD-ME or NADP-ME species remains unresolved.
Several pieces of molecular, biochemical and physio-
logical information indicate that C4 plants of the
NADP-ME subtype, such as sugarcane, maize and sor-
ghum, could exhibit a certain level of flexibility in the
use of the three decarboxylation subtypes (NADP-ME,
NAD-ME and PEPCK) and that these subtypes may not
be genetically determined in a rigid manner [ 5]. Flexibil-
ity, in this context, can be defined as the variation in the
flux of more than one C4 acid decarboxylation pathway
in the same plant depending on the environmental
conditions.
Indeed, the evidence of mixed pathways of decarboxyl-
ation was detected very early, in which approximately
25% of the C 14-labeled CO 2 was incorporated into aspar-
tate in species classified as NADP-ME subtype [ 6]. In
addition, in experiments with maize, significant amounts
of labeled aspartate were produced and isolated bundle
sheath cells were able to use aspartate and oxoglutarate
to generate CO 2 to maintain photosynthesis [ 7]. High
PEPCK expression levels were detected in bundle sheath
cells of maize plants [ 8]. PEPCK activity was verified in
bundle sheath cells in maize, Echinochloa colona, E.
crus-galli, Digitaria sanguinalis and Paspalum notatum ,
categorized as NADP-ME species, but not observed in
NAD-ME subtype species [ 9]. Specifically, in sugarcane,
a study using the SAGE (Serial Analysis of Gene Expres-
sion) technique showed that PEPCK transcript was more
abundant than that of NADP-ME in bundle sheath cells
[10]. Recently, was reported the activity of the three
decarboxylases (NADP-ME, NAD-ME and PEPCK) in
sugarcane plants and that shading caused increases in
the decarboxylation through PEPCK [ 11]. This flexi-
bility in the use of enzymes of different C4 subtypes
has direct consequences on energy requirements for
photosynthesis and, consequently, for the acclimation
to fluctuating environmental conditions [ 5, 11– 13].
The C4 photosynthetic pathways can be differen-
tially controlled depending on different factors such
as environmental conditions and plant developmental
stages. In a study using three different C4 grasses,
Paspalum dilatatum (NADP-ME subtype), Cynodon
dactylon (NAD-ME) and Zoysia japonica (PEPCK), it
was demonstrated that moderate leaf dehydration had
a species-specific effect on the C4 decarboxylases,
mostly by increasing the PEPCK activity in all three
species [ 14]. In view of these studies, it is apparent
that both NADP-ME and PEPCK enzymes are present
in the bundle sheath cells in NADP-ME species, using
malate and/or aspartate as the C4 translocated acid
to generate CO 2 to support photosynthesis [ 12, 15].
Water deficit is one of the main constraints that
restricts the capacity of sugarcane plants to perform
important biochemical functions during crop develop-
ment. One of the first responses to water limitation is
the reduction of the photosynthetic rate due to the
stomatal closure and decline in CO 2 assimilation,
which in turn alters the activity of enzymes such as
Rubisco, PEPC, PPDK, NADP-ME and others [ 16].
Under water deficit, non-stomatal limitations, such as
reduced substrate supply to carboxylases, may cause
sufficient metabolic inhibition in the C4 grasses to re-
duce CO 2 assimilation by approximately 40% [ 17].
Additionally, there is evidence that abiotic distur-
bances, such as drought, affects not only the activities
of the enzymes associated with C4 photosynthesis but
also the transcriptional levels of the genes encoding
these enzymes [ 18]. These are all regulatory mecha-
nisms that may alter in response to abiotic stresses
but that are still undefined at the molecular level in
sugarcane. Thus, the flexibility of the C4 decarboxyl-
ation mechanism to maintain photosynthetic effi-
ciency could be an important factor in plants grown
under environmental stressful conditions, such as
water deficit [ 5, 12].
Therefore, the objective of this work was to study
the enzymes involved in the three decarboxylation C4
subtypes (NAD-ME, NADP-ME e PEPCK) in sugar-
cane plants to verify the possible flexibility between
the pathways in this important NADP-ME crop
species subjected to different water deficit levels. For
this, we (a) characterized two sugarcane cultivars with
distinct responses to water deficit conditions
(RB92579, tolerant, and SP80 – 3280, susceptible to
water deficit), (b) established comparative analyses of
the activities of the enzymes that typify the three sub-
types and (c) measured the changes in the transcripts
of genes encoding enzymes involved in the C4 acid
decarboxylation mechanisms.

Results
Water status, leaf gas exchange and biomass analyses
Water deficit was assessed daily by measuring the leaf
water potential values ( ψw). The plants reached the
pre-established moderate water deficit level ( ψw = − 1.5
to − 1.8 MPa) three days after the onset of the water
deprivation, while the severe condition ( ψw = below −
2.0 MPa) occurred nine days after attaining the previous
water deficit level. We only observed differences in the
water potential values between the susceptible and toler-
ant plants at the end of the experimental period (12
days) when the plants reached the maximum applied
water deficit level. SP80 – 3280 plants showed a reduction
in ψw (− 2.3 MPa) compared with RB92579 ( − 2.0 MPa),
confirming its lower tolerance to water deprivation.
After re-watering, both cultivars recovered the ψw values
recorded in plants under normal irrigation conditions
(Fig. 1).
The water deficit reduced the leaf gas exchange in
both sugarcane cultivars (Fig. 2). The tolerant plants
(RB92579) showed higher CO 2 assimilation rate ( A)
under normal water supply condition. However, when
subjected to water deficit, RB92579 and SP80 – 3280
showed reduced CO 2 assimilation of 7.56 and 7.92 μmol
CO2 m− 2 s− 1, respectively, but without significant
differences between them and between the moderate
and severe water deficit levels within cultivars (Fig. 2a).
The susceptible plants (SP80 – 3280) showed low photo-
synthetic activity (around 50% of the irrigated control)
in the recovery. On the other hand, the CO 2 assimilation
also declined in the tolerant plants after water
deprivation, but the photosynthesis level was reestab-
lished at similar levels as the irrigated control plants at
the beginning of the experiment (Fig. 2a).
A decline in stomatal conductance ( Gs) was observed
until the end of the water deficit treatment in both culti-
vars (Fig. 2b). This decline was observed in plants under
the moderate water deficit, in which these values ranged
from 0.05 to 0.03 mol H 2Om − 2 s− 1 on RB92579 and
SP80– 3280, respectively (Fig. 2b). After 12 days of water
deprivation (severe level) the stomatal conductance
reached values as low as 0.01 mol H 2Om − 2 s− 1 for the
susceptible plants (SP80 – 3280), but no significant differ-
ence was found between the two cultivars at that water
deficit level. In recovery, the tolerant plants RB92579
showed higher stomatal conductance values (Fig. 2b).
Transpiration levels ( E) of the tolerant and susceptible
plants were 60 and 68% lower in moderate water deficit,
respectively, compared with those in the irrigated treat-
ment. Upon increased water deprivation (12 days), both
cultivars reduced their transpiration rate by 95% in
relation to the irrigated treatment. Upon recovery, the
increase in E was higher in tolerant plants (Fig. 2c).
The susceptible plants showed significantly greater leaf
area ( LA) than RB92579 at the normal water supply
condition (Table 1). However, the susceptible plants
(SP80– 3280) showed superior reduction in LA when
subjected to water deficit for 3 days and 12 days (about
16 and 38%, respectively). Under these same conditions,
the tolerant plants (RB92579) showed a leaf area de-
crease of approximately 13 and 34%. We did not observe
significant differences in leaf ( LDW) and root dry weight
(RDW) between the two cultivars in all water deficit re-
gimes (irrigated, moderate and severe levels) (Table 1).
However, as observed for LA, the RB92579 plants had a
smaller reduction in LDW and RDW after withholding
the water supply for 3 and 12 days (19 and 45%, respect-
ively) compared with the susceptible plants under these
same water deficit periods (7% for LDW and 52% for
RDW). The susceptible plants (SP80 – 3280) were charac-
terized by having higher stalk dry weight ( SDW) under
normal water supply condition, which was also reflected
in its higher total dry weight ( TDW) (Table 1). However,
when exposed to water deficit, these plants showed
larger reduction in SDW (36 and 44%, under the moder-
ate and severe water deficit conditions, respectively)

compared with the tolerant plants (RB92579). At the
end of 12 days of water deprivation (severe level), the
total dry weight accumulation was lower in SP80 – 3280
(42%) than in the tolerant plants (30%) compared to the
values in the respective irrigated control plants. No sig-
nificant differences were observed between the recovery
and severe water deficit treatments, showing that 48 h of
rehydration was not enough to cause changes in the bio-
mass of the sugarcane plants (Table 1).
Enzymatic activities
The decarboxylating enzymes NADP-ME, NAD-ME and
PEPCK, and the aminotransferases AspAT and AlaAT,
present only in the NAD-ME and PEPCK subtypes, were
assayed.
In the tolerant plants (RB92579), the activity of the
NADP-ME enzyme was increased in plants under the se-
vere water deficit regime (6.33 μmol min− 1 mg− 1 Chl). In
recovery, the activity of this enzyme declined (25%) to
values similar to the control plants. In susceptible plants,
the highest activity of this enzyme was observed in the
recovery of leaves after the water deficit treatment
(5.71 μmol min− 1 mg− 1 Chl) (Fig. 3a).
Despite a slight increase in the moderate water
deficit compared with irrigated plants, the activity of
NAD-ME did not differ significantly between the
cultivars in these water regimes. On the other hand,
the activity of NAD-ME was stimulated in the toler-
ant plants after rehydration (5.11 μmol min − 1 mg− 1
Chl), while susceptible plants (SP80 – 3280) showed

the highest activity under severe water deficit
(5.92 μmol min − 1 mg− 1 Chl), maintaining similar
values at 48 h after irrigation (Fig. 3b).
Besides showing the highest activity among all the
enzymes analyzed under normal water supply, PEPCK
also presented a large increase in both cultivars when
exposed to deficit conditions. The susceptible plants
(SP80– 3280) showed a gradual increase in the PEPCK
activity until the severe wat er deficit level, maintain-
ing the high activity state at the recovery treatment
(24.78 μmol min − 1 mg− 1 Chl). Likewise, compared to
the irrigated condition, tolerant plants (RB92579)
showed a significant increase in PEPCK activity in
their leaves at both the severe water deficit (91%) and
recovery (138%), with the highest enzyme activity
(28.09 μmol min − 1 mg− 1 Chl) associated with this lat-
ter condition (Fig. 3c).
In relation to the aminotransferases, the AspAT
activity in the leaves of the tolerant plants showed an in-
crease at each level of water deficit, with the greatest ac-
tivity at 48 h after rehydration (3.61 μmol min− 1 mg− 1
Chl). In the susceptible plants (SP80 – 3280), the activity
of this enzyme was higher in the severe water-deprived
plants (4.86 μmol min− 1 mg− 1 Chl), followed by a 20%
decline in recovery (Fig. 3d). The activity of AlaAT in
the leaves of the tolerant plants (RB92579) was higher
than in SP80 – 3280 plants under irrigated and moderate
water deficit regimes, reaching similar values at the se-
vere water restriction level (circa 1.32 μmol min− 1 mg− 1
Chl). When rehydrated, AlaAT activity in susceptible
plants (SP80 – 3280) returned to the level detected in
plants under normal water supply (~ 80% decline), while
those of the tolerant plants also decreased, but to a
lesser extent ( − 23%) (Fig. 3e).

Analysis of gene expression by RT-qPCR
The mRNA profiles of the genes encoding NADP-ME,
NAD-ME, PEPCK, AspAT and AlaAT were significantly
altered in sugarcane leaves of both plant types under
water deficit (Fig. 4).
NADP-ME transcripts were more expressed in leaves
of both irrigated and water-deprived plants of the sus-
ceptible plants relative to the tolerant one, mainly at the
severe water deficit and recovery conditions. The num-
ber of transcripts of NADP-ME in the tolerant plants
(RB92579) had only a small increase under the most se-
vere water deficit level and in the recovery condition
when compared to the watered plants (Fig. 4a).
The two NAD-ME isoforms (both mitochondrial) were
more expressed in the susceptible plants (SP80 – 3280) in
all water regimes. For the NAD-ME1, we detected a
similar pattern in susceptible plants at all levels of water
deficit, whereas an increase in transcript level was asso-
ciated to the stress intensity in the NAD-ME2, with a
noticeable drop 48 h after rehydration . The tolerant
plants (RB92579) exhibited even smaller transcriptional
activities for the NAD-ME1 and NAD-ME2 isoforms
compared with was observed in the susceptible ones
(Fig. 4b, c).
In both sugarcane cultivars, PEPCK gene was
down-regulated in water deprived and rehydrated plants
in relation to those grown under normal water supply
conditions. The susceptible plants (SP80 – 3280)
expressed higher amounts of transcripts of the PEPCK
gene than RB92579 in all water regimes (Fig. 4d).
The two AspAT gene isoforms responded differently to
the water regimes used in this study (Fig. 4e, f).
RT-qPCR analysis revealed that there were more tran-
scripts of the AspAT1 isoform (cytosolic) than AspAT2
(mitochondrial) in the sugarcane leaves. AspAT1 showed
increased mRNA expression at all water deficit levels in
both plant types, but was down-regulated in susceptible
plants (SP80 – 3280) after re-watering. On the other
hand, AspAT2 maintained similar expression levels to
the well-watered condition at the moderate and severe
drought in both cultivars. The mRNA levels of AspAT2
increased only 48 h after re-irrigation, and this was more
noticeable in the case of the susceptible plants.
Compared with the transcription profiles of the other
genes studied here, the AlaAT showed the greatest in-
crease in transcripts number after water deprivation.
AlaAT gene was substantially up-regulated in the sugar-
cane leaves at the severe water deficit condition in the
two plant types (up to 15 fold increase in SP80 – 3280
under severe level). In the recovery treatment, the
mRNA levels of AlaAT severely declined in both suscep-
tible and tolerant plants (Fig. 4g).
Discussion
Leaf water potential ( ψw) can be considered a good
indicator of the water status that maximizes the photo-
synthetic activity of the sugarcane plant [ 16, 19]. Water
deficit-tolerant plants are able to maintain higher ψw
values compared to the more susceptible ones under the
same water restriction level [ 20]. Likewise, in this study,
the tolerant plants (RB92579) showed a weaker ψw
reduction when subjected to severe water deficit for a
period of twelve days (Fig. 1).
Both cultivars showed a reduction in CO 2 assimilation
rates ( A) when subjected to water deficit. However, it is
interesting to note that tolerant plants also presented a
higher assimilation rate compared to susceptible plants
under normal water supply conditions (control treat-
ment) (Fig. 2a). In support of these data, it has been pre-
viously shown that RB92579 plants achieved higher CO 2
assimilation, as well as high stalks biomass and sugar
content in conditions without water restriction [ 21].
After recovery, the susceptible plants maintained low
CO2 assimilation values, indicating that a period of 48 h
after rehydration was not sufficient to recover its CO 2
assimilation capacity, unlike the tolerant plants. This

response was observed in previous studies where some
sugarcane plants subjected to water deficit showed a
minimal increase in the photosynthetic rate following
re-watering, demonstrating less ability to return to the
original homeostasis [ 22, 23].
Irrespective of the cultivar, the reduction in Gs was
more accentuated than the decline in A, indicating that
the inhibition of photosynthesis by the water deficit was
most likely related to stomatal closure in plants under
moderate water deficit (Fig. 2a, b). In sugarcane plants
under water restriction, the decrease in photosynthesis
occurs due to the reduction of stomatal conductance
(Gs)[ 24, 25]. As expected, Gs values were reduced ac-
cording to water deficit severity, but there were no sig-
nificant differences between the plant types in the
moderate and severe levels (Fig. 2b), similarly to what
was reported in other cultivars [ 26].
Sugarcane plants subjected to water deficit conditions
have significantly lower total dry weight, including dry
weight of leaves, roots and stalk, in addition to leaf area
compared with non-stressed plants [ 27]. As expected,
the applied water deficit negatively affected the biomass
of the two sugarcane plant types used in this study
(Table 1). Lower biomass accumulation is associated
with foliar gas exchange rates, mainly with reductions in
A and Gs [28, 29]. Interestingly, the less tolerant plants
presented higher leaf area and stalk dry weight under ir-
rigated conditions, although its photosynthetic rate was
lower than in RB92579, possibly due to counteracting ef-
fects linked to compensation mechanisms between leaf
area and photosynthetic capacity. It is known that plants
with fewer leaves may comparatively show higher photo-
synthetic rates. Increase of the photosynthetic activity is
achieved mainly by enhancing the stomatal conductance
but also by an increase of the mesophyll conductance
[30, 31]. However, water deprivation resulted in a higher
biomass reduction in the susceptible SP80 – 3280 com-
pared with the tolerant plants.
In sugarcane, it has been reported that the Calvin cycle
processes and the C4 pathway are not affected by mod-
erate water stress, but the activities of C4 enzymes are
significantly reduced under severe stress [ 24]. In the
present study, the activities of the NADP-ME, NAD-ME,
PEPCK, AspAT and AlaAT enzymes showed an increase
in both cultivars under severe water deficit, notably the
PEPCK enzyme (Fig. 3). A substantial NAD-ME activity
was detected in our study, with values similar to those
observed for NADP-ME, especially in sugarcane plants
under the severe water deficit treatment (Fig. 3a, b). It
has been speculated that this enzyme provides the ne-
cessary ATP to increase PEPCK activity for sugarcane
plants under stress [ 11, 32]. Western Blot analyses
showed that plant species that use predominantly
PEPCK have significant levels of NAD-ME [ 33]. We also
detected an increase in the activities of AspAT and
AlaAT in both cultivars when exposed to severe water
deficit (Fig. 3d, e). In Z. mays , the bundle sheath cells
showed aspartate decarboxylation capacity and that this
process is apparently performed by a sequence of
enzymatic activities initiated by AspAT, followed by the
activity of the NADP-MDH that generates malate, which
is then decarboxylated by NADP-ME in the chloroplast
[34]. This aspartate decarboxylation may account for
about 20% of the maximum decarboxylation of malate,
contributing partially to the total CO 2 released into bun-
dle sheath cells [ 7].
Furbank (2011) proposes two hypotheses for the
contribution of aspartate to the pool of CO 2 in the
NADP-ME species. The first hypothesis predicts that for
PEPCK to be present in NADP-ME species, the oxaloac-
etate (OAA) produced by aspartate aminotransferase
(AspAT) should be directly decarboxylated in the cytosol
by PEPCK. This enzyme requires ATP from the chloro-
plast or mitochondria for decarboxylation to OAA. In
the second hypothesis, OAA produced from aspartate is
re-reduced to malate in the vascular bundle and then
decarboxylated in the chloroplast by NADP-ME [ 7].
Following the decarboxylation of malate by NADP-ME,
the produced NADPH can be used in the Calvin cycle,
or it can be spent on reducing of OAA to malate. In this
case, pyruvate can return directly to the mesophyll cells
or is converted to alanine by the action of the alanine
aminotransferase (AlaAT), which in turn is sent to the
mesophyll cells. In mesophyll cells, alanine is converted
back into pyruvate and, in both cases, there is a need for
ATP for pyruvate to be converted to PEP [ 5, 12].
According to the above considerations, the increase in
PEPCK activity could be supported by the increment in
the activities of several enzymes: NAD-ME to provide
ATP necessary for this decarboxylase, AspAT to form
the oxaloacetate (OAA) and AlaAT for the production of
alanine through pyruvate, which is, in turn, directed to
mesophyll cells [ 5]. This hypothesis was reinforced in
our study, as we detected an increased activity of these
enzymes when the plants were exposed to the water def-
icit, particularly in the susceptible plants (SP80 – 3280)
under severe water deprivation (Fig. 3). Collectively our
data favor the second hypothesis for the contribution of
aspartate to the pool of CO 2 in the NADP-ME species
[5]. The increased number of transcripts and enzyme
activity (Figs. 3, 4) of AspAT to form OAA, PEPCK for
decarboxylation of OAA forming PEP and AlaAT for
production of alanine through pyruvate support this
view. The flexible use of distinct C4 pathways may po-
tentially allow the maintenance of greater photosynthetic
efficiency under different environmental conditions,
such as those applied in this study. This is because the
use of only NADP-ME requires more energy for the
Cacefo et al. BMC Plant Biology          (2019) 19:144 Page 7 of 14
conversion of pyruvate into PEP in mesophyll cells, in
addition to NADPH for conversion of OAA to malate.
With the use of PEPCK, PEP has the ability to return
directly to the mesophyll cells and is already used in the
carboxylation, without any additional energy expenditure
and without the need for the PPDK enzyme.
The rise in PEPCK activity can be modulated by
various environmental factors [ 5, 11]. Specifically in sug-
arcane, shading caused increases in the decarboxylation
by PEPCK, which shows that this enzyme is the main
decarboxylase under low light conditions [ 11]. These
authors showed that PEPCK decarboxylation uses less
quanta per CO2 fixed than NADP-ME, thus the increase
in PEPCK activity advantageous contribute to maintain-
ing or even increasing quantum efficiency of CO 2 as-
similation under limiting light. Our data showed that by
increasing water deficit level, the activity of the enzymes
important for the reactions involved in PEPCK decarb-
oxylation also increased (Fig. 3).
Given the evidence that the regulation of enzymes
associated with C4 photosynthesis is affected by water
restriction, we analyzed the transcriptional level of the
genes encoding these enzymes [ 18]. The increase in the
number of transcripts of the NADP-ME gene under se-
vere water deficit in the susceptible plants (SP80 – 3280)
can be explained by the fact that under these stress con-
ditions the stomatal conductance is reduced and the
amount of CO 2 entering in the mesophyll cells also
decreases. In this case, as the CO 2 input is lower, there
would be an increase in the expression of this enzyme
to supply the CO 2 required for the Calvin cycle [ 35]
(Fig. 4a). It has been reported that the PEPCK and
AspAT transcripts are not significantly enriched under
water deficit sugarcane plants at stalk elongation
stage, whereas AlaAT was highly induced [ 36], which
also occurred in our work. However, in contrast to
that study, we observed that one of the isoforms en-
coding aspartate aminotransferase ( AspAT1)e x h i b i t e d
high transcriptional activity under severe water restriction
(nine days after irrigation suspension) (Fig. 4e). The high
number of transcripts of the AspAT2 and AlaAT genes
may be associated with the high activity of PEPCK ob-
served in our work (Fig. 3c, 4f and g). In using this second
decarboxylase, other enzymes involved in this pathway are
more necessary to keep the decarboxylation mechanism
working efficiently. This has already been demonstrated in
Z. mays and Setaria viridis , species belonging to the
NADP-ME subtype, where the AspAT and AlaAT genes
were highly expressed in mesophyll and bundle sheath
cells [37, 38].
Although the PEPCK showed high activity in sugar-
cane plants under severe water deprivation (Fig. 3c), the
expression of the gene encoding this enzyme did not fol-
low the same pattern and reduced the number of
transcripts when the two cultivars were exposed to water
deficit (Fig. 4d). The relationship between enzymatic
activities and transcription levels of genes may be the
result of various factors, such as circadian rhythms, tran-
script stability, transcription factors, enhancer activities,
post-transcriptional and post-transductional regulation
pathways, substrate availability and the involvement of
different isoforms in biological processes that occur at
diverse temporal and spatial levels [ 39]. It is known that
the activity of PEPCK is regulated by various factors,
such as light, biotic and abiotic stress [ 40] and the
phosphorylation of PEPCK has been observed in some
C4 leaves [ 41]. Therefore, it is possible that the upregu-
lation of the PEPCK decarboxylation activity in the
sugarcane plants under water deprivation observed here
might be mediated by via phosphorylation – dephosphor-
ylation reactions is tempting to speculate that the upreg-
ulation of the PEPCK activity in the sugarcane plants
under water deficiency observed here does not occur at
the transcriptional level, but rather via modulation of
phosphorylation– dephosphorylation reactions. The puri-
fication of this enzyme and cloning of the complete
cDNA sequence of the PPCK gene may be relevant for
the identification of specific phosphorylation sites and
their functional significance in sugarcane under condi-
tions of water deficiency.
When sugarcane plants were subjected to water def-
icit, there was a large increase in the mRNA expression
of one isoform of the NAD + dependent malic enzyme
(NAD-ME2) in the susceptible plants (SP80 – 3280),
especially under the severe water deficit. However, the
expression of this gene was still lower than that observed
for NADP-ME under normal water supply conditions
(control). In this case, six more cycles of amplification
(Cq - quantification cycle) were required for the detec-
tion of the NAD-ME2 gene in comparison with the
NADP-ME gene in both cultivars (Additional file 2:
Figure S2). Even taking into account the difference in
efficiency of the primers, these data show that the
NADP-ME gene is more expressed (about 50-fold) than
NAD-ME2 in plants under the non-stressing conditions
(Fig. 4a, c). Also, the Cq values for the PEPCK mRNAs
in plants under normal water supply were similar to
those detected for NADP-ME in both cultivars
(Additional file 2: Figure S2). The high expression of the
PEPCK gene was also observed in bundle sheath cells of
maize leaves, a species classified as NADP-ME subtype
[42]. Therefore, the preferred expression of NAD-ME
and NADP-ME genes may not be exclusively correlated
with their corresponding subtype.
As mentioned above, increased gene expression and
activity of AspAT and AlaAT enzymes, which are not
characteristic to the metabolic pathways used in the
classical NADP-ME subtype [ 2, 4], were detected in
Cacefo et al. BMC Plant Biology          (2019) 19:144 Page 8 of 14
sugarcane under water deficit conditions. In agreement
with that, in a transcriptome study with this species
using the SAGE technique, no NADP-MDH transcripts
were detected, while a high mRNA levels of PEPCK and
AspAT genes were identified [ 10]. The observed lack (or
low levels) of NADP-MDH transcription comparatively
to the higher expression of PEPCK and AspAT suggests
that the PEPCK decarboxylation pathway seems to func-
tion in sugarcane leaves, both under conditions irrigated
as well as under water deficit conditions. Our data
support recent research that indicates the occurrence of
mixed decarboxylation C4 pathways in various plants
previously considered to belong exclusively to a single
subtype of C4 photosynthetic mechanism [ 12].
Added to the difficulty of classifying sugarcane in C4
subtypes only by the predominance of the corresponding
enzymatic activity, is the remarkable fact that sugarcane
is the only named NADP-ME species in which the
presence of mestome sheath cells were reported to date
[43, 44]. Plants of the NADP-ME subtype do not possess
a mestome sheath, which is a layer of suberized
non-photosynthetic cells located between the bundle
sheath cells and the vascular bundles (Additional file 3:
Figure S3). Sugarcane is the only interesting exception
because the presence of mestome around its vascular
bundles has been clearly detected [ 43– 46]. In addition, it
is worth mentioning that changes in chloroplast arrange-
ment of bundle sheath cells, from centrifugal (feature
found in the classical NADP-ME species) to evenly dis-
tributed (typical of the PEPCK subtype) were observed
in sugarcane plants grown under shading possibly to in-
crease CO 2 diffusion between the sheath and mesophyll
cells, reducing CO 2 loss [ 11]. These authors suggested
that such a rearrangement is important to maintain the
efficiency of CO 2 assimilation in suboptimal light condi-
tions, which also may be the case during water shortage
conditions.
Finally, although 13C flux measurements in a wider
panel of contrasting cultivars are required to obtain
direct evidence linking PEPCK to drought tolerance, the
great increase in the use of the PEPCK pathway under
water deficit conditions shows that this aspect needs to
be further explored.
Conclusion
The enzymatic activity and gene expression analyses
indicate that sugarcane uses the PEPCK pathway as a
decarboxylation mechanism, in addition to the
NADP-ME pathway. Under conditions of water deficit, a
greater increase in the use of the PEPCK pathway was
detected, particularly in the tolerant cultivar, which rec-
ommends additional investigations to examine the com-
plementary use of the PEPCK decarboxylation pathway
as a response and adaptation of other sugarcane plants
to water deprivation.
Methods
Plant material and water deficit treatment
Sugarcane plants were produced from single node stalk
segments (circa 7 cm in length) from cv. RB92578,
tolerant to water deficit [ 47] and cv. SP80 – 3280, suscep-
tible to water deficit [ 48]. Plants of a similar size (pruned
to one stalk per plant) of each cultivar were grown in
plastic pots (15 L) filled with 13 kg of eutrophic
red-yellow argisoil [ 49] under greenhouse conditions.
Soil fertilization was performed according to chemical
analysis by adding 5 g of 20 – 00-20 (NPK) per pot at 135
DAE (days after emergence) and again at 165 DAE [ 50].
All plants were watered daily to drip point until the be-
ginning of the drought treatment.
The water deficit treatment started 210 days after of
shoot emergence at the stalk elongation phase. Plant
water status was evaluated daily through the leaf water
potential ( ψw) measured with a pressure chamber (PMS
1000, PMS Instruments, USA) at midday in the third
fully-expanded leaf. The treatments consisted of differ-
ent levels of water deficit: control (normal conditions of
water supply, ψw = − 0.4 to − 0.6 MPa), moderate level
(ψw = − 1.5 to − 1.8 MPa) three days after the onset of
the water deprivation, severe level ( ψw = below − 2.0
MPa) twelve days after the onset of the water
deprivation and re-watered plants (48 h after rehydra-
tion, ψw = − 0.6 to − 1.0 MPa). In the control treatment,
the pots were maintained at 100% field capacity, while
for the water deficit treatment the soil water content
was adjusted to 30% of field water holding capacity by
daily watering according to evapotranspirated water esti-
mated by weighing the pots for twelve days. The two
cultivars reached the established water deficit levels at
the same time: the moderate condition occurred three
days after the imposition of the water deficit, while the
severe level occurred nine days after that date, totaling
twelve days of water shortage.
Gas exchange measurements
Leaf gas exchange analysis was performed in the + 1 leaf
(first leaf fully expanded from top to bottom [ 51]), when
the plants reached the established water deficit levels (3
and 12 days after water withholding, and 48 h after rehy-
dratation), always at midday. The environmental condi-
tions during the analysis were PAR (photosynthetic
active radiation) 800 μmol m− 2 s− 1, air temperature be-
tween 28 and 29 °C, average humidity 67 ± 3.3%, leaf
temperature 31.7 ± 0.6 °C and VpdL 2.4 ± 0.6 kPa. The
measurements were made in the + 1 leaf under irradi-
ation of 1600 μmol m− 2 s− 1 and CO 2 concentration of
400 ppm− 1. Leaf tissue was placed in the leaf chamber

and briefly acclimated for 5 min prior to the measure-
ments until the stabilization of the readings. CO 2 assimi-
lation ( A), stomatal conductance ( Gs) and transpiration
(E) were quantified using an infrared gas analyzer
(model Li-6400XTR, LI-COR, Lincoln, USA). The ana-
lyzed leaves were harvested, immediately frozen in liquid
N and stored in ultrafreezer (model MDF-U33 V-PE VIP
ULT, Panasonic, Loughborough, UK) at − 80 °C until the
enzymatic and RT-qPCR analyses. After recovery, the
plants were collected for the biomass analysis.
Enzymatic assays
Extracts were obtained by grinding 20 mg of frozen leaf
samples, removed from the middle third of the + 1 leaf,
in 1 mL of ice-cold extraction medium. For the enzymes
NADP-ME, NAD-ME and PEPCK, the buffer contained
50 mM Bicine-KOH (pH 8.0), 1 mM EDTA, 5% ( w/v)
PVP 25000, 6% (w/v) PEG 4000, 10 mM DTT, 50 mM
2-mercaptoethanol and 1% ( v/v) protease inhibitor cock-
tail [ 14]. For AspAT and AlaAT, the buffer consisted of
10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.25% (w/v) BSA, 0.1% (v/v) Triton
X-100, 50 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl 2,1
mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% (v/v) protease inhibitor
cocktail and 1 mM DTT [ 52].
The maximal activities of the NADP-ME (EC 1.1.1.40),
NAD-ME (EC 1.1.1.39) and PEPCK (EC 4.1.1.49) en-
zymes were quantified [ 14]. For NADP-ME the reaction
mixture (1.5 mL) contained 50 mM Hepes-KOH (pH
8.0), 10 mM MgCl 2, 0.5 mM NADP +, 5 mM L-malate
and 40 μL of leaf extract. For NAD-ME, a solution (1.5
mL) containing 50 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.2), 4 mM
MnCl2, 0.1 mM CoA, 4 mM NAD +, 5 mM L-malate and
40 mL of leaf extract was used for the quantification. In
both analyzes, the extract was incubated with all re-
agents, except the substrate, for 3 min at 25 °C, and the
reaction was started with the addition of L-malate. The
PEPCK was determined using a 1.5 mL solution contain-
ing 100 mM Hepes-KOH (pH 7.0), 100 mM KCl, 90 mM
KHCO3, 5 mM MgCl 2, 2 mM MnCl 2, 1 mM ADP , 0.2
mM NADH, 12 U malate dehydrogenase, 5 mM PEP and
40 μL of leaf extract. The reaction was started with the
addition of PEP. In these three procedures, the absorb-
ance was monitored by spectrophotometry (model
UV-M51, Bel, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) for 1 min at a wave-
length of 340 nm.
The enzymatic activities of AspAT (EC 2.6.1.1) [ 53]
and AlaAT (EC 2.6.1.2) [ 54] also were determined. For
AspAT, reactions were performed in a solution contain-
ing 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.8), 50 mM L-aspartate, 10
mM 2-oxoglutarate, 0.07 mM pyridoxal phosphate, 0.1
mM NADH, 2 U malate dehydrogenase and 40 μL of leaf
extract in a final volume of 1.5 mL. For AlaAT, a
solution (1.5 mL) containing 10 mM L-alanine, 5 mM
2-oxoglutarate, 0.1 mM NADH, 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH
7.5), 5 U lactate dehydrogenase and 40 μL of leaf extract.
In both analyses, the leaf extract was incubated with all
reagents except 2-oxoglutarate for 3 min at 25 °C and
the reaction was started with the addition of
2-oxoglutarate. The absorbance change was monitored
by spectrophotometry at 340 nm for 3 min immediately
after the addition of the substrate in two replicates for
each of three biological replicates per treatment.
The enzymatic activities were based on the total
chlorophyll content. For this, chlorophyll was
determined from 20 mg of leaf tissue maintained in 80%
acetone solution for 24 h at 4 °C and protected from
light. The determination was performed by spectropho-
tometry at 645 nm and 663 nm [ 55].
Biomass
At the end of the experiment, the plants subjected to 3
days (moderate level) and 12 days (severe level) of water
deficit were removed from the pots and divided into
stalks plus leaves and roots for the evaluation of the
biomass. The total leaf area was measured with a leaf
area meter (LI-3000A, LI-COR, Lincoln, USA). The dry
weight of leaves and roots were recorded and averaged
after drying the samples in an air drier at 60 °C until
obtaining a constant weight using a precision balance.
The dry weight of the stalk also was evaluated [ 56].
Selection, search and analysis of candidate gene sequences
We evaluated the levels of mRNAs encoding the follow-
ing enzymes: 1, NADP-ME (NADP-malic enzyme); 2,
NAD-ME (NAD-malic enzyme); 3, PEPCK (phospho-
enolpyruvate carboxykinase); 4, AspAT (aspartate amino-
transferase); 5, AlaAT (alanine aminotransferase). These
genes were chosen for analysis primarily due to their
role in the three subtypes of C4 photosynthesis [ 57, 58].
The identification of sugarcane transcripts related to the
synthesis of the above-mentioned enzymes was done by
identity to the corresponding sorghum ( Sorghum bicolor )
orthologs. The sequences from the coding region of each
sorghum gene were used as queries against sugarcane
ESTs from cv. SP80 – 3280 using the BLAST tools ( https://
blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). The sugarcane ESTs were
acquired from (1) a set of complete coding sequences ob-
tained using 454 sequencing technology [ 59]a n d( 2 )t h e
“Gene Indices Database”, available at ftp://occams.dfci.har-
vard.edu/pub/bio/tgi/data/Saccharum_officinarum/).
The selected sugarcane transcripts were then compared
to the sorghum genome sequences available on GenBank
using BLASTX option to ensure that the transcript was
the best hit against its sorghum ortholog (accession,
e-value, score). Additionally, the sorghum sequences were
aligned with the contigs corresponding to the sugarcane
genes through the ClustalW multiple alignment algorithm
(https://www.genome.jp/tools-bin/clustalw) to assess the

pattern of conservation between the sequences (Table 2).
To ensure a thorough analysis, MultiLoc2 [ 60]a n d
TargetP [ 61] were used to predict the subcellular
localization of the proteins of each enzyme.
Primer design
Primers were designed using the program Primer3Plus
[62] according to parameters established to obtain
amplicons of 80 to 120 bp with a Tm of 57 °C to 60 °C,
length 20 to 23 bp and GC 40 to 80% (Table 2). Se-
quences of the genes with more than one isoform
(NAD-ME and AspAT) were aligned through the Clus-
talW program to identify conserved regions and to de-
sign primers specific for each isoform. To avoid
non-specific annealing to other transcripts, all primer
pairs were challenged against Saccharum spp. sequences
deposited on GenBank using Primer-Blast ( https://www.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/).
RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis
Total RNA was extracted from 100 mg of leaf tissue
removed from the middle third of the + 1 leaf using
the PureLink Plant ™ RNA Reagent (Invitrogen, Carls-
bad, CA, USA) following the manufacturer ’si n s t r u c -
tions. Contaminating DNA was removed using
RNase-free DNase I (Turbo DNase, Ambion, Austin,
TX). The yield of total RNA was assessed spectro-
photometrically at 260 nm UV, its relative purity
estimated by the absorbance ratio at 260/280 nm and
the integrity examined on 1.2% ( w/v) ethidium
bromide-stained agarose gels. The absence of genomic
DNA contamination was confirmed by the lack of
genomic DNA amplification of the endogenous
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH)
gene by PCR.
cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript IV re-
verse transcriptase (Invit rogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA)
from 2 μg total RNA according to the manufacturer ’s
instructions. Specific products and amplicon length
of all primer pairs were verified by PCR using a pool
of all cDNA samples solutions under the following
conditions: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min,
followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 57 °C for 30 s,
72 °C for 30 s, and a final extension step of 72 °C for
2 min. The amplified products were subjected to elec-
trophoresis on 1.5% (w/v) agarose gel to confirm the
product size.
RT-qPCR
The RT-qPCR reactions were performed in a StepO-
nePlus™ Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems),
using the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Applied
Biosystems). Each reaction consisted of 1 μlo fc D N A
sample (1:5 diluted), 5 μlo fS Y B RG r e e nP C Rm a s t e r
mix, and 0.4 μl of each primer (5 μM) and
nuclease-free water to a total volume of 10 μl.
Thermal conditions were 95 °C for 2 min, followed by
40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s and 60 °C for 30 s. All
reactions were performed in triplicate for each of the
three biological replicates, following the minimum in-
formation for publication of qPCR experiments
(MIQE) [ 63]. Melting curves were analyzed to verify
the presence of nonspecific products and primers
were used only in the case of a single peak. The
mean amplification efficiency of each primer pair was
calculated by the LinRegPCR program [ 64]u s i n ga
pool of cDNA derived from all samples (Table 2).
The relative quantification of the expression of each
gene was calculated using the (1 + E) -ΔΔCt method [ 65].
In all analyses, the transcript levels of the target genes
were normalized against the endogenous reference gene
glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase ( GAPDH)
[66]. The relative mRNA levels of each target gene in
SP80– 3280 plants grown under normal water supply
conditions were used as calibrator.
Statistical analysis
The experiment was carried out in 2 × 4 factorial
arrangement (cultivar x water regime), in a completely
randomized design with three replicates within each
water regime. Each replicate was composed of one plant
per pot, totaling 24 plants. Data from the gas exchange
measurements, biomass and enzymatic activities were
subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA), when signifi-
cant, the means were compared by the Tukey test at 5%
of probability using the statistical program SISVAR
version 5.3 [ 67].
