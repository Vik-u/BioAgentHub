ABSTRACT
Rice straw and sugar cane industrial waste are a plentiful source of lignocellulosic biomass with a high poly -
saccharide content, that is hydrolyzed into sugar for microbial growth and their metabolites. 3-Hydroxypropionic 
acid (3-HP) is a promising chemical building block that can be produced from renewable resources. The malonyl- 
CoA pathway is one of the biosynthetic routes for 3-HP production by expressing the malonyl-CoA reductase 
gene ( mcr ). However, the problem of the activity imbalance between the C and N-terminal causes a low con -
version rate of malonyl-CoA to 3-hydroxypropionic acid. This study aimed to balance the bi-functional MCR 
enzyme by dissecting MCR into two fragments and enhancing the supply of intermediates to increase the pro -
duction of 3-HP. The recombinant strain harboring the dissected mcr gene showed a 21-fold increase in 3-HP titer 
compared to the strain carrying the full-length mcr gene. The addition of cerulenin and acetate to the fermented 
medium enhanced 3-HP yield by 8 times, in which recombinant yeast produced 3-HP up to 10 g/L (0.201

). The results of using rice straw hydrolysate as a carbon source indicated that Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae S2 produced 3-HP of 4.02 g/L, which was 0.074 g

in the diluted hydrolysate. These 
findings provide an alternative and sustainable strategy for utilizing lignocellulosic biomass for future 3-HP 
production at an industrial scale.
1. Introduction
Lignocellulosic biomass is an attractive feedstock to produce biofuels 
and high-value chemicals due to its abundance, inexpensive, and 
renewable. The primary lignocellulosic elements utilized in biorefineries 
consist of agricultural wastes such as sugarcane bagasse, wheat straw, 
maize stalks, pineapple leaves, and woody residue [ 1 , 2 ]. Among various 
lignocellulosic feedstocks, rice straw is one of the potential renewable 
energy resources. It contains elevated levels of polysaccharides (70 %), 
including cellulose (32 – 47 %) and hemicellulose (19 – 27 %), which can 
be converted into sugars for microorganisms via pretreatment and 
enzyme hydrolysis process [ 3 , 4 ]. The rice straw hydrolysate was widely 
used as a substrate to produce renewable energy such as ethanol, 
hydrogen, and organic acid [ 5 , 6 ]. The production process relies on 
molasses or sugarcane juice, byproducts of sugar manufacturing, as 
primary raw materials. These feedstocks are characterized by a limited 
shelf life and susceptibility to degradation, manifesting as color alter -
ation and spoilage, if not promptly processed. Despite these inherent 
limitations, their utilization presents a compelling opportunity due to 
the minimal economic value of surplus quantities, thereby substantially 
reducing production costs and enhancing the commercial competitive -
ness of the final products. Consequently, these materials demonstrate 
significant potential for industrial-scale applications. Furthermore, the 
process embodies a bio-renewable polymer synthesis pathway, aligning 
with principles of environmental sustainability. This approach contrib -
utes to a reduction in pollution stemming from factory wastewater and 
Peer review under the responsibility of Editorial Board of Synthetic and Systems Biotechnology.

processing operations.
3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) represents a promising bio-platform 
chemical with potential applications across diverse industries, and its 
production from renewable agro-industrial wastes offers a sustainable 
alternative to traditional petrochemical routes [ 7 ]. Despite the 
acknowledged potential of various biomass feedstocks, including agri -
cultural residues like rice straw, biomass hydrolysates, and 
agro-industrial wastes such as molasses, the existing literature demon -
strates a paucity of fundamental data necessary for robust process 
optimization and scale-up. Consequently, this research endeavors to 
address this knowledge gap by systematically investigating the 
fermentative production of 3-HP utilizing rice straw hydrolysates as a 
primary substrate. Furthermore, the study extends its scope to encom -
pass the evaluation of molasses and sugar factory wastes, thereby 
providing a comprehensive assessment of readily available and abun -
dant feedstocks for 3-HP biosynthesis through the application of 
genetically modified yeast strains.
3-Hydroxypropionic acid is a non-chiral three-carbon organic com -
pound with hydroxyl and carboxyl functional groups that can be 
modified into several high-value substances through chemical reactions. 
The reduction form of 3-HP gives 1,3-propanediol used in 
manufacturing cosmetics, foods, and pharmaceuticals. Moreover, the 
oxidation form of this acid leads to malonic acid that can be used in the 
flavoring and fragrance industries [ 8 ]. 3-HP has various applications in 
the chemical industry, including surgical biocomposite materials, drug 
release materials, cross-linking agents for polymer coatings, metal lu -
bricants, and textile antistatic agents [ 9 ]. As a result, the US Department 
of Energy recognized 3-HP as one of the significant building-block 
compounds that can be generated from renewable resources [ 10 ]. The 
predominant method for producing acrylic acid involves the catalytic 
oxidation of propene, a petroleum-derived feedstock. In contrast, β -hy -
droxy and hydracrylic acids can be generated through diverse natural 
metabolic pathways utilizing glucose or glycerol as substrates by Kleb -
siella spp. However, this biological production route presents significant 
limitations for industrial scalability. The requirement for substantial 
quantities of vitamin B12 in the microbial culture medium renders it 
economically impractical. Furthermore, Klebsiella is classified as a 
Biosafety Level 2 (BSL-2) pathogen, posing additional safety concerns. 
Consequently, despite reported high yields, the practical implementa -
tion of this approach is impeded by substantial challenges related to 
industrial process design and equipment engineering.
In nature, 3-HP functions as an intermediary in the 3HP-dependent 
carbon absorption cycle in the metabolism of some thermophilic 
archaea [ 11 ]. This carboxylic acid is generated from malonyl-CoA in two 
steps by malonyl-CoA reductase (MCR), which catalyzes malonyl-CoA to 
malonate semialdehyde, and then 3-hydroxypropionate 
dehydrogenase/3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase, which converts 
malonate semialdehyde to 3-HP. Alternatively, 3-HP can be synthesized 
using only a bi-functional MCR, which catalyzes malonyl-CoA conver -
sion to 3-HP [ 12 ]. In particular, the bi-functional MCR of Chloroflexus 
aurantiacus has two short-chain domains; the N-terminal domain ex -
presses alcohol dehydrogenase and the C-terminal domain expresses 
aldehyde dehydrogenase, which is commonly used in the construction of 
the malonyl-CoA pathway for 3-HP production in microorganisms [ 13 ]. 
However, the recombinant strain presented a low 3-HP production yield 
due to the imbalance in enzyme activity between MCR-N and MCR-C 
proteins. Lui et al. [ 14 ] demonstrated that point mutations (N940V, 
K1106W, S1114R) and the dissection of MCR into two individual frag -
ments were introduced to improve enzyme activity, which enhanced 
3-HP titer 270-fold via the malonyl-CoA pathway in Escherichia coli . To 
increase the 3-HP yield, malonyl-CoA should be sufficient for MCR ac -
tivity. Hence, many genes are required for overexpression to redirect the 
metabolic flux including acetyl-CoA synthase (ACS), aldehyde dehy -
drogenase (ALD), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 
(GAPDH), pyruvate decarboxylase (PDC), pyruvate dehydrogenase 
(PDH), and acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) [ 15 ]. All these enzymes are 
necessary to catalyze the conversion of glucose to malonyl-CoA. More -
over, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) genera -
tion pathways are required for providing reducing power, which is 
another factor regulating 3-HP synthesis [ 16 , 17 ]. Nonetheless, this 
approach is challenging to control because the overexpression of a few 
enzymes may have no effect or a slight impact on the desired product. 
Furthermore, competing pathways should be knocked out or knocked 
down, particularly the fatty acid pathway, which is primarily respon -
sible for malonyl-CoA utilization and results in low intracellular 
malonyl-CoA levels. Chen et al. [ 18 ] reported that the downregulation of 
fatty acid production by deleting the coregulated phospholipid synthesis 
genes improved the malonyl-CoA-derived products. However, cell 
growth was significantly decreased in mutant strains, indicating that 
gene deletion might cause the repression of phospholipid formation and 
the related pathway, thereby reducing cell growth.
Since fatty acid biosynthesis is important to cell components, 
development, and energy storage, the enzymes in this pathway cannot 
be completely abolished. Attenuating the modified pathway leads to a 
greater malonyl-CoA pool in the cytosol, which promotes 3-HP pro -
duction. The inducer and inhibitor are an interesting approach to 
providing intermediate availability and blocking undesirable products. 
Cerulenin, a powerful fatty acid inhibitor, is widely introduced to 
decrease unwanted malonyl-CoA consumption. This led to improved 
malonyl-CoA accumulation in the cytosol and an increase in the syn -
thesis of malonyl-CoA-dependent molecules. For example, introducing 
cerulenin to E. coli and Corynebacterium glutamicum improved the for -
mation of polyphenolic polyketides [ 19 , 20 ]. It is reported that the 
addition of cerulenin could increase malonyl-CoA concentration to 40 % 
of the total pool [ 21 ]. van Summeren-Wesenhagen and Marienhagen 
[ 22 ] demonstrated that the intracellular malonyl-CoA level rose from 2 
pmol/mg cell dry weight (CDW) to 105 pmol/mg CDW by adding 200 
mM cerulenin, which was more than 50-fold increasing. Cerulenin was 
also used as a fatty acid suppressor for 3-HP production in recombinant 
E. coli and enhanced 3-HP yield by 12-fold [ 23 ]. However, the effect of 
cerulenin on malonyl-CoA reductase expression is limited. Therefore, 
the objective of this study is to construct the 3-HP-producing strain by 
balancing the gene expression between the mcrN and mcrC genes and to 
investigate the effect of cerulenin on mcr gene expression using real-time 
PCR. The mcrC gene was subjected to site-directed mutagenesis to in -
crease MCR enzyme activity. Acetate was added to the production me -
dium to increase the availability of malonyl-CoA in the cytosol. 
Cerulenin was used as a biochemical inhibitor for down-regulating fatty 
acid synthesis. The optimal conditions for 3-HP production from rice 
straw hydrolysate were evaluated for high-yield titers.
In this research, we are interested in studying the effects of gene 
mutations in the mcr segments truncated into mcrC and mcrN cloned into 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and monitoring the effects of 3-HP and fatty 
acid production as well as growth by using hydrolyzed rice straw as a 
substrate. The objective is to create the potential of an alternative car -
bon source that is cheaper than sugar in the market as a source of 
chemical stability in the industry.

S. cerevisiae TISTR5344 was purchased from the Thailand Institute of 
Scientific and Technological Research (TISTR) and used as a wild-type 
background strain. E. coli DH5 α was chosen for all DNA manipula -
tions. The gene encoding malonyl-CoA reductase from C. aurantiacus 
(GenBank: accession no. AY530019.1) was searched in the National 
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database. The pCEV-G1- 
Km vector was a gift from Lars Nielsen and Claudia Vickers (Addgene 
plasmid # 46,813) [ 24 ], which was used as an expression plasmid in 
yeast. E. coli DH5 α was cultured in Luria-Bertani broth (LB) at 37

2.2. DNA manipulation
The mcr gene was synthesized with codon optimization and inserted 
into the pUC19 plasmid (GenScript, USA). The full-length mcr gene was 
digested with Hind III and Bam HI restriction enzymes before being 
ligated into an expression plasmid, which was transformed into 
S. cerevisiae TISTR5344 by the standard lithium acetate method [ 25 ], 
resulting in S. cerevisiae M1 strain.
Three mutation points at mcrC gene (N940V, K1106W, and S1114R) 
of the MCR enzyme were created by site-directed mutagenesis using a 
KOD-Plus-Mutagenesis kit (Toyobo, Tokyo, Japan). The mcrSD11-12, 
mcrSD21-22, and mcrSD31-32 primers for Ser1114, Asn940, and 
Lys1106 site-directed mutation were listed in Table 1 . The PCR ampli -
fied fragment was ligated by a reaction with T4 polynucleotide kinase. 
The ligated PCR products were transformed into E. coli DH5 α by heat 
shock. The resultant plasmid carrying mcrC* gene under the control of 
the pTEF1 promoter was named pDmcrNC*, which was transformed into 
S. cerevisiae TISTR5344, resulting in the S. cerevisiae M2 strain.
The mrc gene was separated into two fragments, including mcrN (1- 
549) and mcrC* (550-1219) by PCR amplification using mcrDC and 
mcrDN primers. The mcr -N fragment was ligated into the pCEV-G1-Km 
vector under the control of the pgk 1 promoter, while mcrC * fragment 
was ligated into the same plasmid under the control of the tef 1 promoter. 
The pMCR-pgkMN-tefMC* was transformed into S. cerevisiae 
TISTR5344, resulting in S. cerevisiae S2 strain. The clones with the cor -
rect inserts were selected and confirmed by colony PCR and DNA 
sequencing.

and vitamin solution were prepared by Kildegaard et al. [ 26 ]. The 
glucose, trace elements and vitamin solution were autoclaved sepa -
rately. The 3HP-producing strain was inoculated in 50 mL of YPD media 
containing 2 % glucose to reach the late exponential phase. Cells were 
harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 5 min at 4

minimal medium. The cell pellet was resuspended in a fresh minimal 
medium containing 50 g/L glucose. The initial inoculum was deter -
mined by measuring the optical density of the culture at 600 nm of 0.5 in 
20 mL medium. The various cerulenin levels were added to the media, 
including 5, 10, 15, and 20 μ M. To estimate the effect of acetate on 3HP 
production, potassium acetate was added to the media at different 
concentrations, including 10, 20, 30, and 40 mM with optimized cer -
ulenin titers. The cultivations were conducted in a shake flask under 
aerobic condition at 30

C and 200 rpm. The fermented broth was taken 
every 24 h for analyzing growth rate and 3-HP production.
2.4. 3-Hydroxypropionic acid production from rice straw hydrolysate
Rice straw (RW) was collected from rice fields in Phichit province, 
Thailand. The straw was ground and homogenized using a sieve of 2 – 5 
mm. The sieved straw was pretreated with hydrogen peroxide (H

. The pH was adjusted to 11.0 with sodium hydroxide (NaOH). 
The bottle of the mixture was incubated at 35 
◦
C with 200 rpm shaking 
for 24 h. The pretreated RW was rinsed with water and dried at 60 
◦
C. 
The cellulase enzyme was used for converting lignocellulose to glucose. 
The enzymatic hydrolysis was conducted using 4 % cellulase (v/v) in 
0.1 M potassium acetate (pH 5) and 10 % (dry matter, w/v) pretreated 
RW was suspended in the solution. To dilute acetate concentration, 50 
mM potassium acetate (pH 5) was used in the hydrolysis step. The 
sample was incubated in a shaker at 200 rpm, 35 
◦
C for 72 h. Rice straw 
hydrolysate was separated from solid pretreated straw and used as a 
substrate for 3-HP formation.
To evaluate the 3HP production from rice straw, the 3HP-producing 
strain was grown in YPD media to provide inoculum. The recombinant 
cell was inoculated in 20 mL of hydrolysate broth with an initial inoc -
ulum density of 2 measured by a spectrophotometer at 600 nm (OD1 
correlates to 1.5 × 10
7 
cells/mL). The experiments were divided into 
three groups including utilizing hydrolysate RW directly, supplementing 
with minerals, and using RW hydrolysate to generate 3-HP. All experi -
ments were performed in a shake flask incubation at 30 
◦
C and 200 rpm.
2.5. 3-Hydroxypropionic acid production from sugarcane juice
The large particles of suspended materials in sugarcane juice were 
eliminated by passing several layers of clean cheesecloth. The raw juice 
was sterilized by autoclave at 110 
◦
C for 20 min. The recombinant strain 
was inoculated in different percentages of sugarcane juice including 20, 
40, 60, 80 % to investigate 3-HP production. The sugarcane juice 
fermentation was divided into two groups experiment consisting of 
supplemented with mineral and without mineral addition. All experi -
ment was performed in a shaking incubator at 30

condition.
2.6. 3-Hydroxypropionic acid production from molasses
To reduce the viscous substance, molasses was diluted to 50 % with 
distilled water. The diluted molasses was passed through several layers 
of clean cheesecloth to eliminate the large particles of suspended ma -
terials. The sterilized molasses was performed by autoclave at 110 
◦
C for 
20 min. This study examined 3-HP production by analyzing the pro -
portion of molasses at 4 levels, including 5, 10, 20, 30 %. The 3-HP 
synthesis from raw sugar was divided into two groups, consisting of 
those supplemented with minerals and those without mineral addition. 
The recombinant S. cerevisiae in molasses was carried out in shaking 
incubator at 30 
◦
C under aerobic condition.
2.7. qPCR analysis
The expression level of mcrC and mcrN genes were monitored by 
qPCR. The seed cultures were performed in 250 mL flask with 50 mL of 
minimal medium for 48 h. The cell pellet was collected by centrifuging 
at 4000 rpm for 5 min. The total RNA from three recombinant strains 
was extracted using a NucleoSpin RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, 
Germany) and reverse transcribed into cDNA by ReverTra Ace ™ qPCR

2.8. Enzyme activity assay
Cell extracts were prepared using a previously reported fast prepa -
ration method for enzyme analysis [ 28 ]. Protein concentrations were 
measured according to the Bradford protein assay and the reaction was 
monitored at 540 nm. Malonyl-CoA reductase activities of the crude-cell 
extract were measured using a previously reported spectrophotometric 
assay [ 29 ]. The rate of NADPH oxidation was measured at 365 nm

) and the oxidation rate of NADPH was 
used to estimate the enzyme activity.
2.9. Analytical methods
Cell growth was detected by using the microplate reader at the 
wavelength of 600 nm. The fermented broth was harvested by centri -
fuging at 10,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was collected for 3-

The SPSS program (version 28.0) was used to analyze the data. One- 
way ANOVA was used to evaluate the significance of the mean differ -
ence between the experiment groups, with the Tukey post-hoc test 
accepting significance at the p 0.05 level. Three replicates of data were 
used to calculate the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the results.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. The expression of mcr gene in the 3-HP-producing strain
The mcr gene from C. aurantiacus has been reported to be the best 
candidate for 3-HP synthesis. This protein is a bi-functional form of the 
MCR protein, which catalyzes the two reaction steps from malonyl-CoA 
to 3-HP. However, the activity of those proteins was unbalanced, 
causing a slow conversion rate of malonyl-CoA to 3-HP. To evaluate the 
gene expression level of bi-functional mcr , qPCR was conducted to reveal 
the relationship between the C and N-terminals in the expression level. 
Three 3-HP-producing strains were used for this study, including M1 
carrying full-length MCR, M2 harboring mutant MCR, and S2 containing 
dissected MCR. The investigation revealed that the transcription levels 
of the mcrC and mcrN genes were imbalanced in the M1 and M2 strains 
harboring the full-length mcr gene. The mcrN gene was expressed at a 
statistically significantly higher level than the mcr -C gene, which was 8- 
fold higher than the mcrC gene in the M1 strain, and it was also 6-fold 
higher than the expression level of the mcrC * gene in the M2 strain 
(p < 0.05). This phenomenon was related to the imbalance of the ac -
tivity of the C and N domains. Due to the lower expression level of the C- 
terminal, the mcrC fragment was separated and independently expressed 
under the regulation of a strong promoter, which showed a rebalance in 
transcription levels between the C and N-terminal in the S2 strain 
( Fig. 1 ). According to comparisons of the transcription levels of the mcrC 
gene in full-length and dissected MCR, the separated mcrC gene was 
expressed at a significantly higher level by 11-fold under the control of 
the pTEF1 promoter than the mcrC gene in the M1 strain (p < 0.05). 
There was no significant change in the expression levels of the mcrC gene 
under the control of the pPGK1 promoter ( Fig. 2 ). Therefore, the pTEF1 
promoter was selected for the regulation of mcrC expression in this 
study.
Concerning enzyme activity and 3-HP production ( Fig. 3 ), the M2

strain harboring the wild-type mcrC gene, whereas the M1 strain pro -
duced 60 mg/L of 3-HP and the M2 strain generated 330 mg/L of 3-HP 
titer. It was improved by 5.5 times. It can be assumed that a side-directed

mutation of the mcrC * gene may have activated enzyme activity and 
increased production yield but failed to recover the balance of protein 
expression levels. The balance of enzyme activity of these proteins was 
not resolved, resulting in a still-lower 3-HP yield. The highest enzyme 
activity and 3-HP yield were obtained from the S2 strain, in which 3-HP 
production was achieved at 1.27 g/L. It was enhanced 21-fold compared 
to the M1 strain carrying the full-length mcr gene. These results sug -
gested that the separated expression of the mcr gene influenced 3-HP 
production, and the increment in the mcrC gene level caused an in -
crease in carbon flux to 3-HP synthesis. This is consistent with the pre -
vious report that mcrC is a rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the 
malonyl-CoA to malonate-semialdehyde [ 31 ]. The independent 
expression of mcrC and mcrN , along with increased mcrC expression, was 
advantageous for this carboxylic acid synthesis [ 32 ].
3.2. Effect of cerulenin on 3-hydroxypropionic acid production
The 3-HP production was further improved by adding cerulenin, 
which inhibited fatty acid synthesis and consequently increased the 
intracellular level of malonyl-CoA. According to the findings, the engi -
neered S2 strain produced 4.83 and 7.66 g/L of 3-HP by adding 5 and 10 
μ M cerulenin, respectively ( Fig. 4 ). In comparison to the control without 
the cerulenin supplement, 3-HP formation was improved by 3.7 and 6 
times, respectively. These findings are consistent with a previous report 
by Lee et al. [ 23 ], in which recombinant E. coli could achieve a 3-HP titer 
of 3 g/L. It was higher than the group without cerulenin by 12-fold when 
50 μ M cerulenin was added to prevent unwanted malonyl-CoA 
consumption.
However, further increases in cerulenin concentration have nega -
tively impacted cell growth and 3-HP production. As a result, 3-HP yield 
was slightly decreased when cerulenin was added up to 15 μ M con -
centration compared to 10 μ M cerulenin due to a reduced growth rate. 
When the concentration was raised to 20 μ M, cell dry weight decreased 
by 37 %, accompanied by a moderate reduction in 3-HP synthesis. At 25 
μ M, the growth rate of the recombinant strain declined by up to 50 %, 
and 3-HP production was significantly reduced. Although cerulenin 
effectively enhances 3-HP yield, high concentrations can adversely 
affect cell viability.
Cerulenin inhibits fatty acid and sterol biosynthesis by binding to the 
enzyme β -ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthases (FabB, FabF, and 
FabH), which promptly interrupts the proliferation of microbes caused 
by lipid depletion [ 33 ]. Therefore, optimizing cerulenin concentration is 
critical to balance the benefits of elevated malonyl-CoA with the pres -
ervation of cellular viability, enabling efficient production of 
malonyl-CoA-derived biochemicals.
According to results on the effect of cerulenin on mcr gene expression 
levels, the balance between mcrC and mcrN gene transcription levels was 
not disrupted for 48 h, whereas cerulenin suppression affected cell 
growth during the exponential phase ( Fig. 5 A). However, the tran -
scription level of the MCR-N fragment was significantly changed in the 
control group without cerulenin at 96 h, which was 13 times higher in 
expression than that of the C fragment. The high increase in imbalance 
expression may be related to a low rate of 3-HP production in cultivation 
without cerulenin. Surprisingly, there was a moderate change in the 
expression levels of the mcrC and mcrN genes in the cerulenin supple -
ment group at 96 h ( Fig. 5 B), resulting in higher 3-HP production in the 
cerulenin supplemented medium. The outcome implied that cerulenin 
did not have much effect on the mcr expression level but had an influ -
ence on the quantity of malonyl-CoA that was provided as a substrate for 
the formation of 3-HP. Davis et al. [ 34 ] reported that cerulenin sup -
plementation enhanced malonyl-CoA levels by up to 10 % in strains with 
normal ACC levels without harming ACC function.

3.3. Effect of acetate on 3-hydroxypropionic acid production
The effect of acetate on cell growth is shown in Fig. 6 A. The growth 
of the recombinant was affected by adding acetate during the expo -
nential phase (24-48 h), resulting in a lower cell density than the control 
without acetate. In a culture containing acetate at 20, 30, 40, and 50 
mM, the yeast began to grow fast after 48 h and achieved a maximum 
growth at 96 h. The cell dry weight of those in a medium containing 
acetate was higher than the control without acetate in cultivation. The 
acetate addition at 30 mM presented the highest CDW at 12.1 g/L, while 
the maximum 3-HP titer was obtained from 40 mM acetate in cultivation 
( Fig. 6 B). The 3-HP yield was improved by 37 % by presenting 40 mM 
acetate, resulting in a yield of 0.201 g
product
/g
substrate
. The results 
demonstrated that adding acetate to cultivation could enhance cell dry 
weight and 3-HP production in this strain.
Under aerobic conditions, S. cerevisiae can consume acetate as an 
alternative carbon source by converting acetate into acetyl-CoA via 
acetyl-CoA synthetase or transforming it into intermediates in the 
glyoxylate pathway [ 35 ]. However, the high concentration of weak 
acids, such as acetate and 3-HP, is commonly toxic to cell development 
and restrains the generation of acids in fermented broth [ 36 ]. Therefore, 
using acetate as a sole carbon source for 3-HP synthesis becomes chal -
lenging due to inefficient cell growth on the acetate, indicating low 
product. According to Lama et al. [ 37 ] finding, the use of glucose and 
acetate, in which glucose was consumed for cell division and acetate was 
used to generate 3-HP, was a more effective approach.
3.4. The production of 3-hydroxypropionic acid from rice straw 
hydrolysate, cane juice, and molasses
After the pretreatment and enzyme hydrolysis processes, the sugar 
content in rice straw hydrolysate was 60 – 70 g/L, consisting of 50 – 55 g/L 
glucose and 5-10 g/L of other sugars. The acetate was detected at 
7.67 – 6.53 g/L in the RW hydrolysate and 3.11 – 2.74 g/L in the diluted- 
acetate hydrolysate ( Table 2 ). The cell growth was low for 72 h and then 
slowly increased after 72 h ( Fig. 7 A). Nevertheless, no 3-HP was 
detected in the induction of hydrolysate directly as a substrate for 3-HP 
synthesis. To improve 3-HP yield, cerulenin and minerals were supple -
mented to RW hydrolysate cultivation. The recombinant strain gener -
ated 0.48 g/L by supplementing cerulenin and 0.83 g/L by adding 
cerulenin and minerals. The 3-HP production in dilute acetate hydro -
lysate was 2.24 g/L with cerulenin addition, which was improved by 4.6 
times compared to non-dilute RW hydrolysate. The highest 3-HP titer 
was obtained from the dilute acetate hydrolysate supplemented with 
cerulenin and minerals, which produced 4.08 g/L of 3-HP, increasing by 
2-fold and 5-fold compared to without mineral addition and non-dilute 
RW hydrolysate, respectively ( Fig. 7 B). The results indicated that rice 
straw hydrolysate could be a viable alternative renewable carbon source 
for producing 3-HP. The better condition for 3-HP synthesis was the 
utilization of hydrolysate with a low concentration of acetate. When the 
buffer for enzyme hydrolysis was diluted, the final titer of acetate in the 
hydrolysate was decreased to 50-55 mM. This finding was consistent 
with the above results, whereas 40 mM acetate was beneficial for the 
three-carbon acid formation.
The application of lignocellulosic hydrolysate as feedstock for 
microorganism fermentation should be carefully monitored for the 
concentration of acetate. It was produced during the hydrolysis of

lignocellulose, which was contained in cellulosic hydrolysates over 10 
g/L [ 38 ]. According to previous reports, the addition of 20 – 80 mM 
acetic acid can cause S. cerevisiae to develop programmed cell death 
[ 39 ]. The cell growth was significantly inhibited, and increased levels of 
ROS were observed in yeast cells, resulting in the metabolic function and 
strength of the cell membranes being lost in the yeast cells [ 40 ]. Addi -
tionally, minerals and vitamins were considered for lignocellulosic hy -
drolysate usage because rice straw is deficient in appropriate amino 
acids, vitamins, and minerals for optimal microbial development and 
enzyme activity. Utilizing rice straw without adding the other necessary 
nutrition sources will result in the microbe performing poorly.
This study investigated the potential of sugarcane juice as a feedstock 
for 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) production using S. cerevisiae S2 
under optimized conditions. The sugarcane juice used contained a total 
sugar concentration of 112 g/L, which was diluted to achieve an optimal 
concentration for 3-HP production. Fig. 8 illustrates the cell growth and 
3-HP production profiles, demonstrating the strain ’ s robust growth and 
significant 3-HP accumulation in sugarcane juice. Notably, a maximum 
3-HP titer of 8.98 g/L was achieved with 40 % sugarcane juice supple -
mented with minerals. In contrast, 60 % sugarcane juice without min -
eral supplementation yielded 8.23 g/L, indicating a marginal reduction 
in 3-HP production. However, a substantial decrease in 3-HP production 
to 5.16 g/L was observed with 60 % sugarcane juice supplemented with 
minerals, representing a 1.7-fold reduction compared to the 40 % juice 
condition. Furthermore, the study revealed significant ethanol produc -
tion, with yields ranging from 10 to 17 g/L, observed in 60 % sugarcane 
juice with mineral supplementation and 80 % sugarcane juice cultiva -
tion, respectively. These results highlight the complex interplay between 
sugarcane juice concentration, mineral supplementation, and the par -
titioning of carbon flux between 3-HP and ethanol production. The 
bioconversion of molasses to 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) exhibited 
a diminished titer, ranging from 0.93 to 3.45 g/L ( Fig. 9 ), in the absence 
of mineral supplementation. This observation suggests a positive influ -
ence of mineral components on 3-HP production utilizing molasses as a

substrate. While molasses provides a rich source of organic nutrients, 
including proteins and vitamins, and inherent mineral constituents, the 
presence of inhibitory compounds such as copper, potassium, and cal -
cium ions, as well as hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF), appears to 
compromise S. cerevisiae metabolic activity. Consequently, the reduced 
3-HP titer without mineral supplementation may be attributed to both 
the absence of essential cofactors and the exacerbation of inhibitory 
effects by the contaminants (see Table 3 ).
The production process utilizes raw materials, specifically molasses 
from sugar factories or sugarcane juice, which exhibit a restricted shelf 
life and are susceptible to discoloration and spoilage if unprocessed. 
These materials present a compelling opportunity for utilization, as 
surplus quantities possess minimal intrinsic value, thereby significantly 
mitigating production costs and enhancing the commercial viability of 
the resultant products. Consequently, these materials demonstrate sub -
stantial potential for industrial and commercial applications. Moreover, 
the process constitutes a bio renewable polymer production method, 
aligning with environmentally sustainable practices. This approach 
further contributes to the reduction of pollution generated by factory 
wastewater and molasses byproducts.
Currently, the main approach to producing 3-HP is chemical syn -
thesis using fossil feedstocks, but chemical manufacturing is expensive 
and toxic to the environment [ 41 ]. In response to the growing increase 
in demand for renewable energy, sustainable development in the 
chemical industry needs to shift to renewable resources as raw materials 
[ 42 ]. This study explored the production of 3-HP from S. cerevisiae using 
rice straw as feedstock. Rice straw is abandoned on the rice paddy field 
after the harvest season. Cheewaphongphan et al. [ 43 ] reported that 
about 26 million metric tons of rice straw were generated after the 
harvesting of rice grain in Thailand, and 685.24 million tons of rice 
straw were produced worldwide [ 44 ]. The straw is usually burned to 
prepare fields for new plantings. However, the burning of leftover straw 
releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing to air 
pollution and global warming. The burning of rice straw is reported to 
emit 1.2–2.2 g of CH
4 
and 0.03–0.07 kg of N
2
O per kilogram of rice 
straw, as well as generate other pollutants such as CO
2
, SO
2
, and par -
ticulate matter [ 45 , 46 ]. Based on this experiment, 15 g of dry rice straw 
could generate 4.08 g/L of 3-HP. Therefore, using 1 kg of rice straw 
ought to provide approximately 272 g/L of 3-HP. The generation of this 
outstanding carboxylic acid production from rice straw, which is 
abundant, renewable, and inexpensive, is a promising alternative for 
improving long-term prospects and reducing negative environmental 
effects.
In relation to these findings, Table 4 compares the 3-HP production 
performance of the engineered S. cerevisiae S2 strain from this study with 
the previous research. It is observed that the 3-HP titter achieved from 
the alternative carbon sources, particularly rice straw hydrolysate, is 
quite competitive, particularly, considering the sustainability and low 
cost of feedstock. This implies that further study in metabolic engi -
neering, indeed, has effectively enhanced the strain’s efficiency.

Furthermore, these results indicate a promising direction for future 
study aimed at optimizing production processes for bio-based chemicals.
In terms of scalability and industrial feasibility, the use of rice straw 
is well-aligned with global initiatives promoting the circular economy 
and carbon footprint reduction. It not only reduces raw material costs 
but also addresses the environmental issues associated with agricultural 
waste disposal by reducing open-field burning and associated emissions. 
Converting this low-value agricultural byproduct into high-value 
chemicals presents clear economic and ecological advantages.
One challenge to consider is the nutritional profile of rice straw 
hydrolysate, which may require supplementation to promote microbial 
growth and metabolic activity. While this could increase production 
costs, strategic optimization, such as co-fermentation with nutrient-rich 
byproducts, could mitigate these expenses.
4. Conclusions
This study demonstrated the 3-HP production from S. cerevisiae S2 
through the malonyl-CoA pathway, whereas the only mcr gene was 
overexpressed. The results indicated that the balancing between C and N 
domain expression is an important feature for 3-hydroxypropionic acid 
synthesis of the malonyl-CoA route. Cerulenin significantly improved 3- 
HP biosynthesis through fatty acid inhibition increasing the malonyl- 
CoA availability. The maximum 3-HP yield of 10.54 g/L (0.201 g
pro -
duct

substrate
) was achieved from the addition of cerulenin and acetate to 
cultivation via the expression of dissected mcr gene, which represented a 
large amount of 3-HP synthesis obtained in S. cerevisiae by expressing 
only a single mcr gene. Moreover, this study revealed the application of 
low-cost raw materials and easy-to-control processes to produce 3-HP by 
using rice straw biomass as a feedstock. The product yield was 0.074
