Abstract The potential ofSaccharomyces cerevisiaefor bio-
catalytic whole-cell transamination was investigated using the
kinetic resolution ofracemic 1-phenylethylamine (1-PEA) to
(R)-1-PEA as a model reaction. As native yeast do not possess
any ω-transaminase activity for the reaction, a recombinant
yeast biocatalyst was constructed by overexpressing the gene
coding for vanillin aminotransferase fromCapsicum chinense.
The yeast-based biocatalyst could use glucose as the sole co-
substrate for the supply of amine acceptor via cell metabolism.
In addition, the biocatalyst was functional without addition of
the co-factor pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP), which can be
explained by a high inherent cellular capacity to sustain
PLP-dependent reactions in living cells. In contrast, external
PLP supplementation was required when cell viability was
low, as it was the case when using pyruvate as a co-substrate.
Overall, the results indicat e a potential for engineered
S. cerevisiae as a biocatalyst for whole-cell transamination
and with glucose as the only co-substrate for the supply of
amine acceptor and PLP.

Introduction
Chiral amines are important building blocks for the synthesis
of bioactive molecules, and efficient and environmentally
benign methods are required for their preparation in high
yield, productivity, product concentration and enantiomeric
purity (Höhne and Bornscheuer2009). Chemical production
of chiral amines with metal catalysts can be cumbersome since
the amine group can, on the one hand, bind to metal ions and
hamper the reaction (Koszelewski et al.2011; Rajan et al.
1974) and, on the other hand, lead to heavy metal contamina-
tion of the product. Alternatively, chiral amines can be pre-
pared using biocatalysis, for example, with the help of
enantioselective ω-transaminases ( ω-TAs) (Koszelewski
et al. 2010; Mathew and Yun2012). ω-TAs catalyze the
transfer of an amine group from an amine donor to a ketone
moiety with pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP) as a co-factor and
can be used to prepare chiral amines either via kinetic resolu-
tion or through asymmetric synthesis from a prochiral ketone.
(S)-selectivity is more common amongω-TAs; however, both
(R)- and (S)-selective enzymes have previously been used to
convert a broad range of substrates with high efficiency,
making this enzyme group a versatile tool for the preparation
of various chiral amine molecules (Koszelewski et al.2010;
Tufvesson et al.2011a).
Transamination reactions may be limited by unfavourable
equilibrium and substrate and/or product inhibition. These
hurdles have been overcome by addition of excess co-
substrates (Savile et al. 2011), in situ product removal
(Truppo et al. 2010) and/or coupled enzymatic systems
(Höhne et al.2008; Koszelewski et al.2008). However, any
added complexity to the reaction system leads to an increase
in the overall process cost (Tufvesson et al.2011a). Until now,
most processes withω-transaminases apply purified enzymes
or crude cell extract from recombinantEscherichia colias a
biocatalyst (Bea et al.2011;K a u l m a n ne ta l .2007; Truppo

amines, excess amount of pyruvate has often been used as a
reactant (Koszelewski et al.2010).
Budding yeastSaccharomyces cerevisiae(baker’sy e a s t )i s
a eukaryotic microorganism having a broad number of bio-
technological applications, including production of biofuels,
commodity chemicals (Hong and Nielsen2012), bioactive
compounds (Ro et al. 2006 ) and biopharmaceuticals
(Mollerup et al.2010). Thus, the feasibility and experience
to use yeast in large-scale bioprocessing is well-developed. In
organic chemistry, baker’s yeast is known for efficiently cat-
alyzing asymmetric carbonyl reductions for the synthesis of
chiral alcohols (D’Arrigo et al.1997; Johanson et al.2005;
Stewart 2000). S. cerevisiaehas been successfully engineered
for asymmetric reduction of prochiral ketones (Johanson et al.
2005 , 2008 ), kinetic resolution of racemic diketones
(Carlquist et al.2008, 2009) or asymmetric Baeyer-Villiger
oxidation of cyclic ketones for the generation of chiral lac-
tones (Kayser et al.1998; Stewart2000).
In the present study, we report on the use of a whole-cell
system expressing anω-transaminase gene originating from
Capsicum chinense(Weber et al.2014) for the kinetic resolu-
tion of (rac)-1-phenylethylamine to (R)-1-phenylethylamine.
Catalytic activity and cell robustness during the reaction and
the use of glucose instead of pyruvate as a co-substrate were
evaluated withS. cerevisiae. We provide a proof of concept
that cell metabolism can be exploited to produce in vivo the
required co-substrate and co-factor of the reaction by only
providing glucose in a buffer system with resting cells.
Materials and methods
Chemicals
Acetophenone (ACP),racemic 1-phenylethylamine (1-PEA),
(R)-1-PEA, (S)-1-PEA and sodium pyruvate were purchased
from Merck (Hohenbrunn, Germany); (R)-1-phenylethanol
and (S)-1-phenylethanol from Sigma-Aldrich (Steinheim,
Germany); PLP from AppliChem (Darmstadt, Germany);
and all other chemicals from VWR (Leuven, Belgium).
Strains
Construction of TMB4350
Plasmid pUC57 V AMT containing theω-transaminase gene
from C. chinense (VAMT, Table 1) was digested with the
restriction enzymesBamHI andPstI, and the resulting frag-
ment was ligated into YIplac128-HXT7p-PGKt that had been
cut with the same restriction enzymes, thus creating plasmid
pNW2. Correct orientation of the insert and sequence was
verified by restriction analysis and sequencing. pNW2 was
cleaved withClaI within theLEU2 marker gene and subse-
quently used to transform the haploid laboratory strain
CEN.PK113-16B (MATa leu2-3,112 MAL2-8C SUC2) which
resulted in strain TMB4350 overexpressing the VAMT-
encoding gene.

were used for whole-cell transamination experiments. Strains
were kept as 20 % glycerol stocks at−80 °C and grown on
solid media for 1–2 days prior to experiments.
Nucleic acid manipulation
Plasmid DNA was prepared with the GeneJET™ Plasmid
Miniprep Kit (Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania). Agarose gel
DNA extraction was performed using QIAquick® Gel
Extraction Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Primers
from MWG-Biotech AG (Ebersberg, Germany) and Pfu
DNA polymerase and dNTPs from Fermentas (Vilnius,
Lithuania) were used for polymerase chain reactions (PCRs).
PCR amplification was performed in a GeneAmp PCR
System 9700 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).
PCR products were purified with the E.Z.N.A.® Cycle
Sequencing Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Inc., Doraville, GA,
USA). Sequencing was performed by MWG-Biotech AG
(Ebersberg, Germany). Restriction endonucleases, shrimp al-
kaline phosphatase and T4 DNA ligase from Fermentas
(Vilnius, Lithuania) were used for DNA manipulation.
Transformation
Competent E. coliDH5α cells were prepared and transformed
as described elsewhere (Inoue et al.1990). Transformants
were selected on solid lysogeny broth (LB) medium
(Ausubel et al. 1995) containing 100 mg/l ampicillin (IBI
Shelton Scientific, Inc., Shelton, CT, USA).E. coli strains
were grown in liquid LB medium containing 100 mg/l ampi-
cillin for plasmid amplification. Yeast strains were trans-
formed using the lithium acetate method (Gietz and Schiestl
2007), and transformants were selected on yeast nitrogen base
(YNB) medium agar plates (6.7 g/l YNB without amino acids,
15 g/l agar, 20 g/l glucose).
Cell growth
A single colony ofE. coliTMB2100 was inoculated in a 0.5-l
shake flask containing 50 ml LB medium (Ausubel et al.1995)
supplemented with 100 mg/l ampicillin. Cells were grown
overnight (at least 16 h) in an incubator at 37 °C with shaking
at 180 rpm. The pre-culture was used to inoculate 250 ml LB
medium containing 100 mg/l ampicillin in a 1-l shake flask at
an optical density (OD)620 of 0.1, and growth was performed at
37 °C and 180 rpm. Expression of the transaminase geneVAMT
was induced by addition of isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside
(IPTG) to a final concentration of 1 mM when the OD620 of
the culture reached 0.6 to 0.8, and incubation was then contin-
ued for 24 h at 15 °C and 180 rpm.S. cerevisiaestrains were
first grown on solid YPG medium (10 g/l yeast extract, 20 g/l
peptone, 15 g/l agar, 20 g/l glucose), and then, a single colony
was picked with a sterile inoculation loop and transferred to
5 ml liquid YPG medium (10 g/l yeast extract, 20 g/l peptone,
20 g/l glucose). The pre-culture was grown overnight at 30 °C
and 180 rpm and used to inoculate a 1-l shake flask containing
Growth inhibition
Inhibition of growth by substrate and product was determined
in a growth-based microplate assay using liquid YPG medium
supplemented with 0–200 mM of ACP or (rac)-1-PEA.
S. cerevisiaecells were pre-grown in YPG medium and inoc-
ulated at an OD620 of 0.1 in five wells in 96-well microtitre
plates for each product/substrate level. Growth was measured
after 24 h and used to determine the level of inhibition at
different substrate and product concentrations.
Whole-cell transamination
Reactions were performed in magnetically stirred (140 rpm)
100-ml sealed serum flasks using 5 g/l cell dry weight (dw) at
30 °C. The solution contained 20 ml of 100 mM sodium
phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), 40 mM pyruvate or 400 mM
glucose, 4–75 mM (rac)-1-PEA and 0–1.0 mM PLP.
Cell viability
Cell viability was determined every 24 h during whole-cell
transamination by counting colony forming units (CFU/ml)
on solid media plates. Samples were diluted in series of
tenfold in saline 0.9 % NaCl solution and streaked on solid
YPG medium. CFU per millilitre were counted after incuba-
tion for 2 days at 30 °C.

by filtering a known volume of cell suspension through nitro-

for E. coliand S. cerevisiae, respectively. Filters were washed
with distilled water, dried in a microwave oven at 350 W for
8 min, cooled in a desiccator and weighed. Glucose, pyruvate,
glycerol, acetate, succinate and ethanol were determined by
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using an

with a RID-10A refractive index detector (Shimadzu, Kyoto,
Japan) at 30 °C with 5 mM H
2SO4 as a mobile phase and at a
flow rate of 0.6 ml/min. Conversion and stereoisomeric purity
of 1-PEA were determined using HPLC (Waters Binary HPLC

equipped with a Daicel Chiralcel OD-H column (4.6×
25 mm, 5μm) using 85:15 heptane/isopropanol with 0.1 %
butylamine as the eluent at a flow rate of 1 ml/min and at a
room temperature of 22 °C. The following retention times were
obtained: (R)-1-PEA, 5.6 min; (S)-1-PEA, 6.8 min; (R)-1-
phenylethanol, 4.9 min; (S)-1-phenylethanol, 5.3 min; and
ACP, 4.6 min. The compounds were determined as the peak
area at a wavelength of 210 nm.
Results
Transaminase activity in recombinantE. coliand S. cerevisiae
Kinetic resolution of (rac)-1-PEA to (R)-1-PEA was used as a
model reaction (Fig.1) to investigate the potential of recom-
binant S. cerevisiaeas a whole-cell biocatalyst for the prepa-
ration of chiral amines. In previous studies, whole-cell
transamination has traditionally been performed with recom-
binant E. coli overexpressing selectiveω-TAs, and the bio-
catalyst has been considered as an“enzyme bag”.T or e l a t et h e
performance of the recombinant yeast system with anE. coli-
based system (Weber et al.2014), the catalytic activity and
stability of both biocatalysts were determined in a reaction
buffer supplemented with pyruvate and PLP. Adding both
components ensured that any difference in catalytic activity
did not arise from different abilities of the two species to
generate amine acceptors from a fermentable carbon source.
As endogenous transaminase activity towards (rac)-1-PEA
might decrease the yield of kinetic resolution, non-engineered
E. coliand S. cerevisiaelacking the VAMT enzyme were first
investigated for background activity. However, no transami-
nase activity towards (rac)-1-PEA was detected (data not
shown), thereby demonstrating that both hosts were suitable
for whole-cell transamination of (rac)-1-PEA. Overexpression

conversion of (S)-1-PEA (Fig.2a, b) with initial specific reac-
tion rates 0.022 and 0.002 mmol/g dw/h, respectively. ACP
was the only product for both whole-cell systems, and no
formation of 1-phenylethanol from the activity of endogenous
ketone reductases could be observed (data not shown). The
conversion of (S)-1-PEA completely stopped after 24 h with
the E. colibiocatalyst, resulting in a final conversion of only
24 % and an enantiomeric excess (ee) of 33 % after 96 h
(Fig. 1a). In contrast, theS. cerevisiaebiocatalyst remained
active for approximately 200 h, and (S
)-1-PEA was nearly
completely consumed, leading to a final conversion of 45 %
and ee of 83 % (Fig.2b).

acceptor, yeast metabolism must be active throughout the
transamination reaction. It is thus important to know the level
at which the substrate and product inhibits metabolism. The
concentration boundaries of the bioprocess were estimated by
determining the substrate and product inhibition of cell growth
for the prototrophic lab strain CEN.PK113-7D and the yeast
biocatalyst TMB4350 (Fig.3a, b). In the control strain without
overexpression ofVAMT, growth was impaired by concentra-
tions above 30 mM ACP. Addition of (rac)-1-PEA, in con-
trast, led to strong inhibition of growth already above 5 mM,
and no growth was observed above 10 mM. The overexpres-
sion ofVAMT had no significant influence on the inhibitory
effect of ACP. With 1-PEA, however, growth was impaired
but still observed up to 15 mM, although the standard devia-
tion between biological replicas was too high to conclude any
potential difference in substrate tolerance compared to the
control strain. The inhibitory effect of 1-PEA suggests that
the reaction should be performed below 15 mM (rac)-1-PEA.
However, inhibition of growth occurred at a lower concentra-
tion than arrest of the reaction for non-growing cells exposed
to reaction conditions with glucose as the sole co-substrate.
The specific productivity was highest at 25 mM (rac)-1-PEA;
however, the reaction was possible up to approximately
50 mM, although at a lower rate (Fig.3c). Therefore, in the
following experiments, 25 mM (rac)-1-PEA and non-growing
cells as a biocatalyst were chosen.
Glucose as a source for amine acceptor
For S. cerevisiae, glucose is the preferred carbon source over
other sugars (Johnston1999), and the metabolic flux to the
central metabolite pyruvate is proficient both under aerobic
and anaerobic conditions (Nissen et al.1997). Therefore, the
use of glucose as a co-substrate for whole-cell transamination
of 25 mM (rac)-1-PEA was evaluated under conditions where
PLP was externally supplemented (Fig.4a). External addition
of 0.1 mM PLP was made to assess the ability ofS. cerevisiae
to generate amine acceptors independently from the capacity
of the cell to sustain required PLP levels. The specific reaction
rate was approximately 0.013 mmol/g dw/h during the first
48 h, and then the reaction rate rapidly decreased after 72 h,
leading to a conversion of about 23 %. The reaction efficiency
was similar compared to directly supplying pyruvate in the
reaction solution; initial specific reaction rate was
0.008 mmol/g dw/h, and approximately 22 % conversion
was reached after 144 h (Fig.4a).
While the reaction with pyruvate as a co-substrate does not
depend on the cells being viable and metabolically active, the
viability is a main determinant for high reaction efficiency
with glucose as a co-substrate as amine acceptors need to be
provided through glucose catabolism. To gain a deeper under-
standing of the reaction outcome, cell viability was assessed
by analyzing CFU on agar plates containing rich medium
throughout the reaction (Fig.4b). It could be concluded that
the arrest in reaction was not due to loss in viability, which
remained high throughout the experiment (viability=7.3 log
(CFU/ml) after 144 h). With pyruvate on the other hand, the
viability significantly decreased (37 times faster death rate),
which resulted in a complete loss of viability after 48 h.
With glucose as a co-substrate, the cells were also meta-
bolically well active after the reaction had stopped, as dem-
onstrated by a continuation of glucose consumption until
120 h (Fig.4c). The specific glucose consumption rate was
0.68 mmol/g dw/h, and the main extracellular metabolites
were, in decreasing order, ethanol, glycerol and acetate.
Pyruvate was not detected in the reaction solution, as it was
expected since it is not a metabolic end product, and it is thus
normally not present at high concentration or transferred into
the fermentation broth due to a negative molecular charge at
cytosolic pH (Postma et al.1989).

PLP availability inS. cerevisiae
Kinetic resolution of 25 mM ( rac)-1-PEA was carried
out at different concentrations of PLP and with glucose
or pyruvate as a co-substrate to evaluate whether suffi-
cient intracellular PLP could be synthesized during bio-
catalyst production and/or during the reaction to sustain
the activity of recombinant transaminase. The specific
productivities were calculated for the first 48 h and are
summarized together with final conversion and ee in
Table 2. Student’s t test was used to statistically assess
differences between experiments. Remarkably, the bio-
catalyst was operational without addition of PLP to the
reaction mixture with either glucose or pyruvate as a
co-substrate. The initial productivity was ca two times
higher with glucose than with pyruvate as a co-
substrate, leading to a significantly higher conversion.
For glucose, there was no sta tistical difference in the
initial reaction rate between without addition of PLP
(0.013±0.002 mmol/g dw/h) and with the addition of
0.1 mM PLP (0.013±0.002 mmol/g dw/h). However,
when taking into account the standard deviation from
biological replicates, it cannot be excluded that there
still may be a small difference in catalytic activity with
or without addition of 0.1 mM PLP. By increasing the
PLP concentration to 0.2 or 1.0 mM, the initial specific
productivity was increased as compared to without PLP.
Further, the addition of PLP led to a longer continuation
of the reaction and thus a higher final conversion (17

respectively with glucose as a co-substrate). The effect
of PLP addition was even more pronounced with pyru-
vate as a co-substrate (7 and 22 % final conversion with
0 and 0.1 mM PLP, respectively).

In the present study, we demonstrate that recombinant
S. cerevisiae can be functional as a whole-cell catalyst for
the kinetic resolution of racemic amines. When compared
with isolated enzyme systems, whole-cell biocatalysis only
requires one cultivation step for the production of biocatalyst
in which all necessary enzymes can be co-expressed, and there

is no need for cell disintegration or costly enzyme purification
(Tufvesson et al.2011b). One main additional advantage of
the constructed yeast biocatalyst is that the transamination
reaction can proceed with glucose as the only co-substrate,
i.e. without external addition of pyruvate co-substrate or PLP
co-factor.
When comparing recombinantS. cerevisiaewith theE. coli
biocatalyst, significantly higher initial catalytic activity was
observed withE. coli. As buffered systems containing both
pyruvate and PLP were used, the difference did not result from
different abilities of the two species to generate amine accep-
tors and PLP from dissimilation of a carbon source. Instead,
the difference indicates that theE. colibiocatalyst may have
contained a higher level of the recombinant enzyme than the
yeast. However, the recombinant enzyme was not visible by
SDS-PAGE analysis of cell extracts from any of the two hosts
(Supplementary material Fig.S1), and it cannot be excluded
that other unknown mechanisms are involved in the observed
difference in activity. Another observation specific for the
E. colisystem was an arrest of the reaction after 24 h, which
could partly be a result from enzyme inhibition by the product
ACP as has been observed for otherω-TAs (Park and Shin
2013; Shin and Kim1997). On the other hand, the reaction
continued with yeast for ca 200 h, and ACP was the only
detectable product from the conversion of (S)-1-PEA. In fact,
ACP seemed to be inert to yeast metabolism, and no conver-
sion to 1-phenyethanol or other by-products was observed in
separate bioreduction experiments in which ACP and glucose
for co-factor regeneration were directly added to the reaction
buffer solution containing freshly harvested metabolically
active cells (data not shown). The activity of endogenous
yeast reductases, such as YMR226c that has previously been
reported to convert ACP (Yang et al.2007), was thus too low
for any significant formation of 1-phenylethanol. Inhibition of
the enzyme by ACP cannot solely explain the arrest in reac-
tion forE. coliand not forS. cerevisiae, and other causes such
as lower cell robustness and/or enzyme degradation under
applied reaction conditions may have been involved. A similar
trend has previously been observed when the two hosts were
compared for whole-cell bioreduction of a xenobiotic ketone,
and it was attributed to a drop inE. coliviability at a faster rate
than the S. cerevisiae counterpart (Parachin et al. 2009).
Altogether, theS. cerevisiaebiocatalyst displayed high stabil-
ity, high selectivity and no by-product formation during
whole-cell transamination; however, the catalytic activity
needs to be elevated before being relevant in an industrial
setting.
V AMT enzyme fromC. chinense can use pyruvate and
oxaloacetate as an amine acceptor (Weber et al.2014), and
both are generated as intracellular metabolites from glucose in
S. cerevisiae; pyruvate is the end product of glycolysis, where-
as oxaloacetate is an intermediate of the Krebs cycle that can
also be produced in the cytosol via pyruvate carboxylase
(Walker et al.1991). In practice, however, oxaloacetate is
generally not present in the extracellular liquid, whereas low
levels of extracellular pyruvate have been detected during
aerobic cultivation on glucose (Flikweert et al. 1996).
Therefore, the performances of the yeast biocatalyst were only
compared between glucose and pyruvate as a co-substrate. In
both cases, ACP was generated at similar initial rate, which
highlighted the potential of glucose as a co-substrate. The rate
of pyruvate synthesis is limited by the glycolytic rate; how-
ever, the specific glucose consumption rate was 52 times
higher than the specific reaction rate (0.68 and 0.013 mmol/
g dw/h, respectively). Pyruvate availability may still be limit-
ing, since it is not an end product of glucose fermentation;
consequently, the transaminase competes with other enzymes,
namely, pyruvate carboxylase, pyruvate dehydrogenase and
pyruvate decarboxylase for pyruvate utilisation (Pronk et al.
1996). More difficult to explain is the discrepancy between
reaction continuation with pyruvate as a co-substrate and the
significant slowing down of the reaction for glucose, despite a
continuation of glucose uptake. It can be speculated that the
availability of pyruvate and other intracellular amine acceptors
became scarcer at the later stage of the reaction due to a
reduced carbon flux to ethanol. However, direct external
addition of pyruvate after 72 h had no significant influence
on the reaction, and the same final conversion and ee of the
product was reached (data not shown). This demonstrates that
although pyruvate availability from glucose catabolism may
still have partly limited the reaction efficiency, other causes
such as degradation/inactivation of V AMT may also explain
the reaction arrest. Worth noting is that viability was signifi-
cantly lower with pyruvate as a co-substrate than with glucose,
which may be speculated to be a result of lowering the
intracellular pH by the weak acid pyruvate (pKa=2.49)
(Dawson 1968). Uncharged weak acids can diffuse over the
plasma membrane (Mira et al.2010), and once inside the cell,
at physiological pH, they dissociate and hydronium ions are
formed, decreasing the intr acellular pH (Pampulha and
Loureiro-Dias 1990). Yeast has an efficient ATP-driven H
+
pump for maintaining intracellular pH homeostasis (Verduyn
et al. 1990); however, its efficiency under the applied non-
growing conditions may be hampered. The negative effect of
pyruvate on non-growing cells in a buffer system has, to the
best of our knowledge, not been studied previously. Pyruvate
can, in fact, be used as the sole carbon source for cell growth
(Fendt and Sauer2010). However, the negative effect on yeast
physiology by other weak acids, for example, acetate, has
been well-documented previously (Pampulha and Loureiro-
Dias 2000).
Another advantage of using glucose as the sole co-substrate
was that the yeast biocatalyst was operational without addition
of PLP, which suggested that intracellular PLP was available
in high amount in the beginning of the reaction. The reaction
continued though for a longer time when PLP was added,
4622 Appl Microbiol Biotechnol (2014) 98:4615–4624
which may be due to a leakage of intracellular PLP or lack of
de novo biosynthesis during the reaction progress. In theory,
the amount of PLP should be more than sufficient to sustain
the activity of the recombinant transaminase. The initial spe-
cific reaction rate wasr
(S)-1-PEA/X=0.013 mmol/g dw/h for
transamination of (S)-1-PEA during the first 48 h with glucose
as the sole co-substrate, which is approximately 100 times less
than the theoretical minimum-specific transamination reaction
rate capacity in yeast (seeSupplementary materialfor calcu-
lation of the theoretical reaction capacity). Proteins constitute
42–60 % of the total yeast biomass composition (Nissen et al.
1997; Verduyn et al.1991), and 16 out of 20 amino acids
require a transaminase for their synthesis either in the amino
acid-forming reaction or in the upstream biosynthetic pathway
(cf. review by (Ljungdahl and Daignan-Fornier 2012),
Supplementary material TableS1). Hence, there is hypothet-
ically a large potential for an increased biocatalytic transam-
inase activity without the requirement for PLP supplementa-
tion. The fact that PLP addition had a more pronounced effect
when pyruvate was used as a co-substrate may be linked to the
sharp drop in cell viability. This is an advantage of glucose
since high cell robustness and physiological fitness under
bioprocess conditions are fundamental for fully exploiting
the cellular capacity for PLP-dependent reactions. Moreover,
the PLP-building blocks glyceraldehyde-3′-phosphate and
ribulose-5′-phosphate are intermediates in the glycolysis and
the pentose phosphate pathway; thus, an efficient gluconeo-
genesis is required for their formation from pyruvate
(Kanehisa et al.2012).
The aim of the present study was to explore the pos-
sibility of using the metabolic framework of yeast for
biocatalytic transamination reactions. Although the produc-
tivity and enantioselectivity of the present catalyst are still
too low to be relevant in an industrial setting (Tufvesson
et al. 2011b), it demonstrates the potential of recombinant
yeast as a biocatalyst and the use of glucose as the sole
source of amine acceptor, without the requirement of PLP
addition. The addition of PLP significantly adds to the
process cost, and the glucose-fermenting yeast principle
offers a simpler and cheaper bioprocess set-up than tradi-
tional systems based on enzyme catalysis. Engineering of
process conditions, and of the whole-cell biocatalyst for
increased specific activity, and increased space-time yield
is the target for future engineering work. This may e.g. be
achieved by an elevatedω-TA level in combination with
re-constructed pyruvate and/or oxaloacetate dissimilatory
reactions. As ACP may be inhibiting for the enzyme, a
product removal system may also increase the bioprocess
efficiency.
