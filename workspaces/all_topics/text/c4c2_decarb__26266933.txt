Abstract
The fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) protein superfamily of metabolic enzymes com-
prises a diverse set of enzymatic functions, including ß-diketone hydrolases, decarboxyl-
ases, and isomerases. Of note, the FAH superfamily includes many prokaryotic members
with very distinct functions that lack homologs in eukaryotes. A prokaryotic member of the
FAH superfamily, referred to as Cg1458, was shown to encode a soluble oxaloacetate
decarboxylase (ODx). Based on sequence homologies to Cg1458, we recently identified
human FAH domain containing protein-1 (FAHD1) as the first eukaryotic oxaloacetate
decarboxylase. The physiological functions of ODx in eukaryotes remain unclear. Here
we have probed the function offahd-1, the nematode homolog of FAHD1, in the context of
an intact organism. We found that mutation offahd-1 resulted in reduced brood size, a
deregulation of the egg laying process and a severe locomotion deficit, characterized by a
reduced frequency of body bends, reduced exploratory movements and reduced perfor-
mance in an endurance exercise test. Notably, mitochondrial function was altered in the
fahd-1(tm5005) mutant strain, as shown by a reduction of mitochondrial membrane poten-
tial and a reduced oxygen consumption offahd-1(tm5005) animals. Mitochondrial dys-
function was accompanied by lifespan extension in worms grown at elevated
temperature; however, unlike in mutant worms with a defect in the electron transport
chain, the mitochondrial unfolded protein response was not upregulated in worms upon
inactivation offahd-1. Together these data establish a role offahd-1 to maintain mitochon-
drial function and consequently physical activity in nematodes.

Introduction
The fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH) protein superfamily branches out through all
organisms, from prokaryotes to humans, comprising a diverse set of enzymatic functions. Its
distinguishing feature is the highly conserved catalytic domain structurally characterized by
the FAH fold. Although the FAH fold is highly conserved, FAH superfamily members cover a
wide range of diverse enzymatic activities, including hydrolases, isomerases, and decarboxyl-
ases. Overall, the FAH superfamily includes many prokaryotic members with very distinct
functions that lack homologs in eukaryotes. This can be explained by the fact that these
enzymes are part of highly specialized metabolic pathways, involving chemical compounds
that higher organisms are unable to convert and utilize for their metabolism [1]. One recently
identified prokaryotic member of the FAH superfamily found inCorynebacterium glutami-
cum, referred to as Cg1458, was characterized as a novel soluble oxaloacetate decarboxylase
(ODx) [2,3]. Whereas eukaryotic ODx enzymes were not identified so far, we recently found
that human FAH domain containing protein 1 (FAHD1), a mitochondrial protein [4], dis-
plays ODx activity, establishing the first eukaryotic oxaloacetate decarboxylase [5]. The physi-
ological function of ODx enzymes in eukaryotes remains to be established. When the FAHD1
gene was deleted in mice, we found that FAHD1
-/- mice were viable [5] and did not display
striking phenotypical abnormalities (H. Pircheret al., unpublished), suggesting that compen-
satory mechanisms may exist in mice which may obscure phenotypical changes resulting
from deletion of the FAHD1 gene. Here, we identified the nematode homolog of FAHD1,
referred to asfahd-1, and assessed the consequences of its mutational inactivation in the nem-
atode C. elegans, a lower eukaryotic model organism widely used for the analysis of metabolic
regulation [6] and mitochondrial physiology [7].
Materials and Methods
Computational homology modeling of nematode FAHD-1 structure
A homology model was generated to compare the structure of FAHD-1 fromC. elegans based
on the sequence of ZK688.3 (NP_498715.1). As expected, sequence search revealed the FAH
domain containing structures as suitable templates. Sequence identity is 46.3% for FAHD1
(PDB code 1SAW), with a similarity of 64.5%. Although this structure is the closest in
sequence, we selected the FAH protein fromYersinia pestisCO92 (PDB code 3S52) as tem-
plate, having a better resolution and a completely resolved structure for chain A (closed and
structured lid). The template and the target sequence share 39.7% sequence identity. The
model was generated with MOE homology modeling tool (Chemical Computing Group, MOE
release 2013.08) with chain A and D of 3S52 as templates for a dimer model using the force
field option Amber12EHT. The model had unexpected cis amid configurations for Arg8 in
chain A and B as well as Lys13 in chain A, which are solvent exposed or in the dimer interface
respectively. They are associated with outliers in the Ramachandran plot for the neighboring
Asn9 in chain B and Lys13. Additionally the distal residue Asn147 in chain B and Pro135 in
both subunits have suspicious backbone configurations. However, the binding site shows no
parameters indicating quality issues in the model structure. In the active site, side chain orien-
tations of Arg100 and Glu65 were manually adapted. The initial model was complemented by
water positions and co-crystallized ions from the structure of human FAHD1 (PDB code
1SAW) and not the template, as the latter does not include the magnesium ion in the active
site. Eight individual water molecules forming too close contacts with the model were removed.
To allow water and active site adaptions to the magnesium ion, the assembly was energy mini-
mized in several steps with decreasing positional restraints on the atoms.

Nematode strains and cultivation
C. elegans were cultured using standard protocols [8,9] at 20°C unless stated otherwise. The
wild-type strain N2 ancestral and the transgenic strain SJ4100: N2;Is[phsp-6GFP] were obtained
from the Caenorhabditis Genetics Center (CGC; University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, USA;
https://www.cbs.umn.edu/research/resources/cgc). The deletion mutantfahd-1(tm5005) was
obtained from the‘National Bioresource Project for the Experimental Animal‘Nematode C.
elegans” (Head: Dr. Shohei Mitani, Tokyo Women’s Medical University, Tokyo, Japan) and
backcrossed six times to N2 ancestral. The reporter lines N2;Ex[p
fahd-1GFP; pRF4] and N2;Ex
[pfahd-1FAHD-1::GFP; pRF4] were generated in our laboratory (see below).
Generation of reporter lines
For the transcriptional reporter line N2;Ex[pfahd-1GFP; pRF4], the promoter region of thefahd-1
gene (approx. 2 kb upstream of the start codon; obtained by PCR using genomic DNA as tem-
plate) was cloned in front of GFP in the plasmid vector pPD95.75 (gift from Andrew Fire;
Addgene plasmid #1494 [10]) using the primersGCG-AAGCTT-ATATCAGGTTCCTCATACC
AGG (forward primer; including restriction site for HindIII) andGC-GGATCC-GTCTAAAATGT
AGTTTTTTTTGTTTC(reverse primer; including restriction site for BamHI). For the translational
reporter line N2;Ex[p
fahd-1FAHD-1::GFP; pRF4], the full-lengthfahd-1 gene (including promoter
region, exons, introns) was cloned in-frame in front of GFP of the same plasmid vector using the
primers GCG-AAGCTT-ATATCAGGTTCCTCATACCAGG(forward primer; including restriction
site for HindIII) andGC-GGTACC-AC-CTGAACATTAAATTTGGAATTCAA(reverse primer;
including restriction site for KpnI). The reporter constructs were injected into the cytoplasm of
the syncytial gonad of young adult N2 ancestralC. elegans following standard protocols [11]. For
identification of transformants, pRF4, a plasmid that carries therol-6(su1066)dominant transfor-
mation marker, was co-injected. The F1 offspring was observed for evidence of the transgenic
marker and each F1 transformant was separately cloned onto a new plate. F2 animals that had
inherited and expressed the transgenic array were considered as stable lines.
RNAi constructs
The RNAi clone forcco-1 (DFCIp3320A1211012D) was generated in the laboratory of Dr. Marc
Vidal and obtained via Source BioScience (http://www.lifesciences.sourcebioscience.com). The
fahd-1 RNAi clone was generated by targeting the entire coding region of the gene using the
primers TA-CCATGG-CACCAGCTCTACAGTAGTCA(forward primer; including restriction site
for NcoI) andTA-CTCGAG-GGACCATTGGTCTCGTTAGG(reverse primer; including restric-
tion site for XhoI). The PCR product was cloned into the L4440 vector (gift from Andrew Fire;
Addgene plasmid #1654; [10]) and transformed intoE. coli HT115(DE3) [12].
Basic phenotypical analysis
Phenotypical assays were performed using 4-day old worms because many phenotypes are most
pronounced at this age. The basic phenotype offahd-1 mutant C. elegans was determined using
established protocols [13]. To determine brood size, single worms were put on fresh NGM agar
plates seeded withE. coli OP50 every 12 hours for the entire length of the reproductive phase.
The progeny (larvae) were counted after 2 days. The brood size of 10 individual worms of each
strain and condition was examined. Egg-laying behavior was analyzed by putting 4-day old
worms individually in M9 buffer (50μl per well in a 96-well plate) and counting eggs outside
the worms after 1, 2, 3, and 4 hours. The experiment was performed 3 times; each time 24
worms per strain were analyzed. To test locomotion, 4-day old hermaphrodites were placed on

an empty (i.e. without bacterial lawn) NGM agar plate. After letting them adjust for 30 seconds,
the body bends (one body bend is deemed as one sinusoidal movement until the worm reaches
the same posture again) for one minute. The experiment was performed 3 times; each time 10
individual worms per strain were analyzed. The radial dispersal rate (describing the distance an
animal moves away from the starting point in a given time period) was determined as follows:
4-day old hermaphrodites were put in the center of an NGM agar plate seeded withE. coli
OP50. The radial dispersal was determined after 30 seconds, 1 minute, and 2 minutes. The agar
plate was radially scaled in different zones; zone 1 was 0– 5 mm, zone 2 was 5– 15 mm, zone 3
was 15– 25 mm and zone 4 was 25– 35 mm from the starting point. The experiment was per-
formed 3 times; each time between 20 and 50 worms per strain were analyzed. Swimming
endurance performance was tested by putting 4-day old animals in M9 buffer (50μl per well in
a 96-well plate) and screening every hour for characteristic thrashing behavior. Worms that did
not show these characteristic thrashing movements were considered as‘not swimming’. The
experiment was performed 3 times; each time 24 worms per strain were analyzed.
Analysis of mitochondrial parameters
Analysis of mitochondrial parameters was performed with 3-day old adults to avoid excessive
contamination with eggs and progeny. The mitochondrial membrane potential was examined
using the membrane potential-sensitive dye tetramethylrhodamine, ethyl ester (TMRE;
obtained from Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA). Approx. 56-hours old animals were placed
on NGM agar plates containing 100 nM TMRE, stained overnight and pictured when they
were 72 hours old using epifluorescence microscopy. The quantification of the fluorescence
signal (pixel intensity) was performed using ImageJ (imagej.nih.gov/ij/). The fluorescence sig-
nal of 30 individual animals per strain was determined. The oxygen consumption rate was
measured using an OROBOROS Oxygraph 2K (Oroboros Instruments GmbH, Innsbruck,
Austria) as described [14], with the following modifications: Approx. 300 3-day old worms
were collected in S basal buffer, washed and delivered into the chamber in 2.5 ml of S basal
medium. The chamber was kept at 20°C and measurements were performed for 15 min.
Obtained data were analyzed using DatLab 4 software (Oroboros Instruments GmbH, Inns-
bruck, Austria). The slope of the straight portion of the plot was used to derive the oxygen
consumption rate. Worms were recovered after respiration measurements and counted. Res-
piration rates were normalized to number of worms. The experiment was performed 4 times.
Mitochondrial localization was determined by co-staining the translational reporter N2;Ex
[p
fahd-1FAHD-1::GFP; pRF4] with MitoTracker Red (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, USA).
3-day old animals were stained overnight with 100 nM MitoTracker Red that was applied to
the NGM agar plates and pictured when they were 4 days old.
Lifespan determination
Lifespan experiments were carried out following standard protocols [15] at 20°C and/or 25°C.
To tightly synchronize the animals used in the lifespan assays, adult hermaphrodites were
allowed to lay eggs for 2 h on NGM plates seeded withE. coli OP50. The synchronized popula-
tion was allowed to develop under defined conditions. At L4 larval stage animals were trans-
ferred to fresh plates in groups of 15– 20 worms per plate for a total of 200 worms per
experiment. The day the eggs were laid was considered as t = 0. Animals were transferred to
fresh plates every day during their reproductive period to separate them from their progeny
and every second day thereafter until the end of their lifespan. The worms were checked every
day for touch-provoked movement and pharyngeal pumping. When no reaction could be
observed, they were considered as dead. Worms that died due to internally hatched eggs, an

extruded gonad or intestine, or desiccation due to crawling off the plates, or worms that buried
themselves in the agar and could not be transferred to fresh plates were censored and not incor-
porated into the analysis. Each lifespan assay was carried out at least three times. The software
GraphPad Prism 5 (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, USA) was used for statistical analysis.
Survival curves were created using the product-limit method of Kaplan and Meier. The log-
rank (Mantel-Cox) test was used to evaluate differences between survivals and determine the
corresponding p values. For RNAi lifespan experiments, worms were placed on NGM plates
containing 1 mM IPTG and 50μg/ml ampicillin and seeded withE. coli HT115(DE3) bacteria
transformed with either the test RNAi construct or the empty L4440 vector (gift from Andrew
Fire; Addgene plasmid #1654) as control. In order to abolish all maternally inherited mRNAs,
the second generation grown on RNAi bacteria was used for lifespan experiments.
Western blotting
To avoid contamination of protein lysates with bacterial proteins, freshly starved worms were
washed off the agar plate with M9 buffer, washed several times and then snap frozen in liquid
nitrogen. The worm pellets were thawed on ice and 150μl of protein lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-
HCl pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40, 0.5% DOC, 0.1% SDS; supplemented with protease
inhibitors (1 Complete Mini EDTA-free tablet per 10 ml, Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mann-
heim, Germany)) were added. The worms were broken up using a Branson Sonifier 250 and
then incubated on ice for 30 min. The lysate was cleared by centrifugation for 20 min at
16,000 x g and 4°C. The protein concentration was determined using Bradford assay. Lysates
(30 μg total protein) were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted onto a PVDF membrane. Pep-
tide-specific rabbit polyclonal antibody against FAHD-1 (2μg/ml; generated by BioGenes
GmbH, Berlin, Germany and purified in our lab), and anti-rabbit HRP-conjugated secondary
antibody (Dako P0399, 1:2,500, Dako, Glostrup, Denmark) were applied by standard Western
blot protocol.β-actin antibody JLA20 (Calbiochem CP01, 1:10,000, Calbiochem, La Jolla,
USA) was used for loading control with an anti-mouse HRP-conjugated secondary antibody
(Dako P0447, 1:10,000). Detection was achieved by ECL Prime (GE Healthcare, Chalfont St
Giles, UK).
Single worm duplex PCR
The genotype of thefahd-1(tm5005) animals was determined by single-worm duplex PCR
using standard protocols [16]. Three primers (first forward primer (F1; in front of deletion):
CATGTCTTCACTCGCTGGAT; second forward primer (F2; within deletion):CATTGGAGGT
TACACTGTCG; reverse primer (R1):GATCATCACATCGGTACGAC) that produced two differ-
ently sized products (one that arises from the wild-type allele and one that arises from the
mutant allele) were used. Primers F1 and R1 produced a 337 bp amplicon that was specific to
the mutant allele. Primers F2 and R1 produced a 220 bp amplicon that was specific to the wild-
type allele. The product of primers F1 and R1 of the wild-type allele was too long (573 bp) to be
significantly amplified. The PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis.
Fluorescence microscopy
C. elegans were mounted in a drop of M9 buffer containing 10 mM NaN3 or 10 mM levamisole
(levamisole hydrochloride, Sigma, St. Louis, USA) as anesthetics on glass microscope slides.
Fluorescent images were taken using a Nikon Eclipse TE300 connected to a Nikon Digital Sight
DS-U2 camera. Confocal images were taken using an AxioObserver Z1 LSM710 confocal micro-
scope and a Zeiss Axiophot equipped with the BioRadμRadiance Confocal Scanning System.

Statistical analysis
Each experiment was performed at least three times (see figure legends and individual methods
for details). Mean value and standard deviation were calculated. The significance levels were
determined using the Student’s t-test unless stated otherwise (see Lifespan determination). p
values <0.05 were considered as significant.
Results
Identification offahd-1, the worm homolog of human FAHD1
To identify theC. elegans homolog of the human oxaloacetate decarboxylase (ODx) FAHD1
[5], a bioinformatics search was carried out. The gene with the provisional name ZK688.3 was
identified as the closest and only homolog of FAHD1 in the nematode genome. This annota-
tion was also confirmed by reverse BLAST (data not shown). The nematode protein, referred
to as FAHD-1, contains 48% identical amino acids relative to human FAHD1 and shows high
amino acid sequence similarity in the presumed catalytic center (Fig 1A); in particular, all of
the amino acids which are presumed to be relevant for ODx function in human FAHD1 [5] are
conserved in the nematode homolog. Moreover, computational modeling revealed a structure
of the catalytic center highly similar to human FAHD1 (Fig 1B).
Analysis offahd-1 expression in nematodes
To analyze the expression pattern of FAHD-1 in adult worms, a transcriptional reporter was
generated, in which a GFP reporter gene was driven by thefahd-1 promoter. After injection of
the reporter gene, expression was monitored by fluorescence microscopy. We found a broad
expression of FAHD-1 in various tissues of adult worms (Fig 2A), including the body wall mus-
cles, the vulva, the pharynx as well as various types of neurons and the canal cell (Fig 2B).
To determine both the time course of expression and the subcellular localization of the pro-
tein, a translational reporter was constructed in which expression of a FAHD-1::GFP fusion
protein is driven by thefahd-1 promoter. This reporter strain was used to monitor expression
of the gene during development and adult life (Fig 2C). We found thatfahd-1 is expressed
from the early gastrula stage throughout the adult life in various tissues. We also used the trans-
lational reporter to monitor subcellular localization of FAHD-1 in worms co-stained with
MitoTracker Red. As shown inFig 2D, the signals obtained by FAHD-1::GFP and MitoTracker
Red were largely colocalized, indicating specific mitochondrial localization of FAHD-1 in nem-
atodes, consistent with previous findings that human FAHD1 localizes to mitochondria [4].
Characterization of mutant strainfahd-1(tm5005)
To address the function of FAHD-1 in worms, a deletion mutant, referred to asfahd-1
(tm5005), was generated and analyzed. First, DNA and protein lysates were prepared and ana-
lyzed to verify the mutant genotype. As shown by single worm duplex PCR, all worms of a ran-
domly picked sample had the correct gene deletion, and successful disruption of thefahd-1
gene was supported by results of Western blot, using a peptide-specific antibody recognizing
specifically C. elegans FAHD-1 (Fig 3A). Together, these data suggest that FAHD-1 function is
completely abrogated in the mutant animals.
The deletion mutant differed from the wild-type by a significant reduction in body size (S1
Fig) and a significant reduction in brood size (Fig 3B). When the egg laying behavior was fur-
ther analyzed, we found thatfahd-1(tm5005) animals at the young adult stage carried an irregu-
lar number of eggs (varying in number between 12 and 63) at the age of 96 hours. Under these
conditions the number of eggs in wild-type worms was rather constant (i.e. between 18 and 20

eggs) (Fig 3C). When kept under starvation conditions (M9 media w/o bacteria), egg laying
was inhibited in wild-type worms; under these conditions,fahd-1(tm5005) mutants continued
to lay eggs, indicating that deletion offahd-1 causes an abnormality in the egg-laying process
(Fig 3D), which may reflect muscular and/or neuronal changes in the egg laying apparatus (see
also below,discussion).

amino acid sequences revealed 47% identity between the two proteins. Amino acids relevant for the ODx function of FAHD1 are boxed. (B) Conserved

Inactivation offahd-1 leads to mitochondrial dysfunction and locomotion
deficits
Since oxaloacetate decarboxylase converts oxaloacetate, a key metabolite of the tricarboxylic
acid (TCA) cycle, back into pyruvate, it is conceivable that mitochondrial function may be
altered infahd-1(tm5005) mutants. This was addressed by monitoring the mitochondrial mem-
brane potential using the potential sensitive dye TMRE. Confocal microscopy of TMRE stained
worms revealed intense and specific staining of discrete globular structures, consistent with dis-
crete and potential-specific mitochondrial staining (S2 Fig). Whereas the overall membrane
potential varied considerably between individual worms of either genotype, the average mito-
chondrial membrane potential was significantly reduced infahd-1(tm5005) mutants (Fig 4A),
suggesting that the absence of oxaloacetate decarboxylase activity reduces mitochondrial

severe when raised at 25°C (right panel; 199±SD 71.30 for wt vs. 98.8±SD 49.23 forfahd-1(tm5005); p = 0.0013; N = 10). (D) Egg laying patterns were

unfavorable conditions,fahd-1(tm5005) worms ‘lose’them over the course of time (2.08±SD 1.75 for wt vs. 10.26±SD 0.32; p = 0.0598 for 60 min, p< 0.002

the wild-type andfahd-1(tm5005) genotype. While wild-type worms carry between 18 and 20 eggs,fahd-1(tm5005) animals show great variety in the number
of eggs, tending to accumulate them in the uterus. Representative pictures are shown.

function. In support of this conclusion, we found that oxygen consumption offahd-1(tm5005)
mutants was significantly decreased compared to wild-type animals (Fig 4B).
These findings prompted us to analyze locomotion behavior, which conceivably requires
robust mitochondrial function. We found that the mobility of the worms, measured in an
exploratory test, was significantly reduced for thefahd-1(tm5005) mutant (Fig 5A). Further-
more, the analysis of the radial dispersal rate revealed a significantly reduced locomotion dur-
ing a 2-minute test period (Fig 5B). To address the capability of the worms for endurance
physical activity, worms were subjected to a swimming assay in liquid medium, where the
number of worms remaining actively swimming in liquid culture was monitored over a period
of ten hours. In this assay, thefahd-1(tm5005) mutants displayed a significantly reduced physi-
cal performance (Fig 5C). The altered locomotion behavior of thefahd-1(tm5005) mutant
strain was also evident when movement of the worms was monitored (S1 and S2 Movies). To
verify that these phenotypes are not caused by second-site mutations introduced during the
generation of the deletion mutant and not eliminated during outcrossing, afahd-1 rescue line
was produced, in which thefahd-1 gene (including promoter, exons, introns, and 3’-UTR) was
transgenically expressed infahd-1 mutant worms. The mobility phenotypes offahd-1 worms
could be partially rescued by the transgene (S3 Fig).
Lifespan extension of mutant strainfahd-1(tm5005) is independent of
UPRmt
It is known that mild mitochondrial dysfunction, e.g. due to alterations in the stoichiometry of
electron transport chain (ETC) complexes, can extend the lifespan of so-called“Mit” mutants
of C. elegans [17]. We found that lifespan of thefahd-1(tm5005) mutant was unaltered with
respect to the wild-type worms when assayed at 20°C (Fig 6A). When lifespan was analyzed at
25°C, we found that under these conditions the medium lifespan offahd-1(tm5005) mutants
was significantly increased (Fig 6B). Lifespan extension at 25°C could also be confirmed by
RNA interference (Fig 6C).
In long-lived Mit mutants, lifespan extension is often mediated by activation of the mito-
chondrial unfolded protein response (UPRmt)[ 18]. To test if UPRmt contributes to the lifespan
extension of FAHD-1 depleted worms observed at 25°C, a UPRmt reporter strain was used

carrying a reporter construct in which the heat shock protein-6 (HSP-6) promoter drives
expression of green fluorescence protein (GFP). As a positive control, ETC subunitcco-1 was
specifically depleted by RNA interference. This led to a strong positive GFP fluorescence signal
in the treated worms, reflecting activation of UPRmt [19]. Under these conditions, knocking
down fahd-1 by RNAi had no effect at either 25°C (Fig 6D) or 20°C (S4 Fig). Together these
observations indicate that lifespan extension by knock-down offahd-1 does not involve activa-
tion of the UPRmt.
Discussion
In the present communication, we have probed the function offahd-1, the nematode homolog
of the recently identified human oxaloacetate decarboxylase FAHD1, in the context of an intact
organism. We found that mutation offahd-1 resulted in reduced brood size, a deregulation of
the egg laying process and a severe locomotion deficit, characterized by reduced exploratory
movements and reduced performance in an endurance exercise test. Notably, mitochondrial
function was altered in thefahd-1(tm5005) mutant strain, as shown by a reduction of mitochon-
drial membrane potential and a reduced rate of oxygen consumption. Mitochondrial dysfunc-
tion was accompanied by lifespan extension in worms grown at elevated temperature; however,

(without bacterial lawn) and the number of body bends was counted for one minute.fahd-1(tm5005) animals show fewer and more uncoordinated body
bends compared to wild-type animals (28.53±SD 1.12 for wt vs. 11.57±SD 0.42 forfahd-1(tm5005); p = 1.60E-05; N = 3 experiments (30 worms total)). (B)
4-day old wild type andfahd-1(tm5005) worms were put in the center of an NGM plate seeded withE. coli OP50. The radial dispersal rate (seeMaterials and
Methods) was determined for three different time points (30 sec, 1 min, 2 min). The radial dispersal rate is decreased infahd-1(tm5005) C. elegans compared
to wild-type controls (3.41±SD 0.76 zones after two minutes for wt vs. 1.69±SD 0.11 zones after two minutes forfahd-1(tm5005);p < 0.03 in all cases; N = 3
experiments (90 worms total)). (C) 4-day old wild-type andfahd-1(tm5005) hermaphrodites were screened for their swimming endurance performance in M9
buffer for up to 10 h. Wild-type worms are able to swim significantly longer thanfahd-1(tm5005) worms (94.56%±SD 4.72% swimming after 5 hours for wild-
type vs. 23.72%±SD 6.18 swimming after 10 hours forfahd-1(tm5005); p = 0.001; N = 3 experiments (72 worms total)).

unlike in mutant worms with a defect in the electron transport chain, UPRmt was not upregu-
lated in worms upon inactivation offahd-1 by RNA interference. Together these data establish a
role offahd-1 to maintain mitochondrial function and physical activity in nematodes.
Similar to the findings reported here forfahd-1(tm5005) animals, reduced physical fitness
and an increased lifespan was observed in several nematode strains with genetic defects in sub-
units of individual complexes of the electron transport chain (ETC) or in other components
modulating ETC substrate availability, generally referred to as“Mit” mutants [20]. However,
the mutant nematodes generated here do not display defects in the ETC; instead, deletion of
fahd-1, coding for a mitochondrial metabolic enzyme, seems to alter mitochondrial metabo-
lism in a different way, conceivably by antagonizing pyruvate carboxylase (PC) which, under
certain metabolic conditions, restores oxaloacetate levels through the carboxylation of pyruvate
[21]. Whereas in many“Mit” mutants, disturbed stoichiometry of a given ETC complex leads
to massive accumulation of unfolded proteins in the mitochondrial matrix, we anticipate that
the ETC is intact infahd-1(tm5005) animals. Consistent with this conclusion, UPR
mt was not
activated in an UPRmt reporter strain upon depletion offahd-1.
The fahd-1(tm5005) mutant nematodes described here displayed some behavioral differ-
ences to the wild-type which may shed further light on the physiological function offahd-1 in
nematodes. Besides an overall reduction in brood size, the mutant worms also displayed differ-
ences in egg-laying behavior. On the one hand,fahd-1(tm5005) animals started egg-laying
slightly later than wild-type animals (data not shown) and, in contrast to the stereotypic egg-
laying pattern displayed by wild-type worms, we observed a large variation in the number of
eggs contained infahd-1(tm5005) animals at any given time point. Moreover, the response of
egg-laying to starvation [22] was disturbed infahd-1(tm5005) animals. When deprived of food,
egg-laying ceases in wild-type worms and fertilized eggs are retained in the uterus where they
continue to develop. This modulation of egg-laying behavior by food involves an antagonistic
action between serotonin (5HT) and dopamine: application of 5HT to worms immediately
elicits egg laying in the absence of food [23,24], and dopamine inhibits egg laying induced by
either 5HT or food [25]. Whereas wild-type worms did not lay any eggs under starvation con-
ditions, fahd-1(tm5005) animals continued egg-laying under these conditions. In wild-type
worms, egg-laying is an active process regulated by neuronal signals mediated by 5HT and
other signals and requires an intact vulvar musculature. Accordingly, the changes in egg-laying
behavior observed infahd-1(tm5005) animals point to altered (reduced) function of the vulvar
musculature, altered neuronal function or a combination of both. The same holds true for the
altered changes in locomotion behavior, which may be due to altered (reduced) function of the
body wall muscles and/or altered function of the corresponding neurons. Reduced muscular
function offahd-1(tm5005) animals may be explained by the observed reduction in mitochon-
drial activity.
Both the overall structure and all critical amino acid residues (in particular H30, E33, D102,
R106; see [5]) known to be relevant for the ODx activity of human FAHD1 are conserved in
the nematode FAHD-1 protein. Whereas an increase in oxaloacetate concentration was
observed in both the kidney and liver of FAHD1
-/- mice [5], technical difficulties precluded the
reproducible determination of oxaloacetate levels in worm lysates (A. Taferneret al., unpub-
lished). Thus, it remains to be formally established that nematode FAHD-1 protein decarboxyl-
ates oxaloacetatein vivo. If so, the inhibition of mitochondrial activity observed infahd-1
(tm5005) animals may be explained by increased intracellular concentration of oxaloacetate,
which is known to inhibit several mitochondrial enzymes such as succinate dehydrogenase
[26,27]. On the other hand, metabolites of the tricarboxylic acid cycle are well known precur-
sors for essential neurotransmitters, such as glutamate and serotonin, and the sustained synthe-
sis of such neurotransmitters requires the anaplerotic function of PC, i.e. the ability to produce

oxaloacetate from (glycolytic) pyruvate. Since FAHD1 functions as antagonist of PC, at least in
mice [5,21], it is tempting to speculate that any alterations of neuronal function infahd-1
(tm5005) animals could be related to the influence of FAHD-1 on the metabolism of relevant
neurotransmitters, such as glutamate and serotonin. Whereas further work will be required to
address these questions, the work reported here describes for the first time a functional analysis
of FAHD-1 in an intact organism.
