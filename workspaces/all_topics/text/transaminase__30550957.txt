ABSTRACT
In this study, two stereocomplementary ω-transaminases fromArthrobacter sp. (AsR-ωTA) and Chromobacterium
violaceum (Cv-ωTA) were immobilized via iron cation affinity binding onto polymer-coated controlled porosity
glass beads (EziG ™). The immobilization procedure was studied with different types of carrier materials and
immobilization buffers of varying compositions, concentrations, pHs and cofactor (PLP) concentrations. Notably,
concentrations of PLP above 0.1 mM were correlated with a dramatic decrease of the immobilization yield. The
highest catalytic activity, along with quantitative immobilization, was obtained in MOPS buffer (100 mM, pH
8.0, PLP 0.1 mM, incubation time 2 h). Leaching of the immobilized enzyme was not observed within 3 days of
incubation. EziG-immobilized AsR-ωTA and Cv-ωTA retained elevated activity when tested for the kinetic re-
solution of rac-α-methylbenzylamine (rac-α-MBA) in single batch experiments. Recycling studies demonstrated
that immobilized EziG
3-AsR-ωTA could be recycled for at least 16 consecutive cycles (15 min per cycle) and
always affording quantitative conversion (TON ca. 14,400). Finally, the kinetic resolution of rac-α-MBA with
EziG3-AsR-ωTA was tested in a continuous flow packed-bed reactor (157 μL reactor volume), which produced
more than 5 g of (S)-α-MBA (> 49% conversion, > 99% ee) in 96 h with no detectable loss of catalytic activity.
The calculated TON was more than 110,000 along with a space-time yield of 335 g L−1 h−1.
1. Introduction
Industrial application of biocatalysts has been expanding, particu-
larly in the pharmaceutical and fine chemical industries (Choi et al.,
2015; Madhavan et al., 2017; Prasad and Roy, 2018; Schmid et al.,
2001). Because of their low environmental impact, elevated catalytic
efficiency and exquisite selectivity, enzymes are an appealing option for
the synthesis of many high value compounds in batch- as well as con-
tinuous flow reactors (Sheldon and Woodley, 2018). However, the
majority of biocatalytic processes are still based on the less costly and
time-consuming use of whole cell systems (fermenting, resting or lyo-
philized cells) or crude cell extracts, which do not require steps for
enzyme purification. (Choi et al., 2015; Madhavan et al., 2017). An
often-common disadvantage of these types of applications is the bio-
catalysts’ lack of reusability, which reduces chemical turnover numbers
(TONs) and increases the environmental impact. Additionally, other
proteins present as impurities can catalyze possible side-reactions,
thereby negatively affecting the selectivity of the process. Other dis-
advantages of biocatalytic processes using whole cells include the lower
volumetric productivities and the frequent occurrence of cell breakage;
the latter process generates debris that can contaminate the reaction
medium.
Enzyme immobilization is gaining importance for continuous flow
biocatalysis using isolated enzymes (Britton et al., 2018). Recyclability
of enzymes, along with increased stability, chemical selectivity as well
as operational window can effectively be enabled by immobilization
onto a support material, thereby making the enzyme perform as a
heterogeneous catalyst (Sheldon, 2007; Sheldon and van Pelt, 2013).
Although stabilization is the most common objective for enzyme im-
mobilization, enzyme hyper-activation (Fernandez-Lafuente et al.,
1998; López-Serrano et al., 2002; Mingarro et al., 1995; Reetz, 1997),
modulation of catalytic selectivity (Palomo et al., 2002a, b; Palomo
et al., 2004) and decrease of inhibition of catalytic activity can be also
pursued (Fernandez-Lafuente et al., 1999; Mateo et al., 2004; Wilson

T
et al., 2004a, b). Enzyme stabilization is mainly achieved by rigidifi-
cation of the protein structure by multi-point covalent attachment or
multi-subunit immobilization (Mateo et al., 2007; Santos et al., 2015).
Existing techniques of enzyme immobilization are generally cate-
gorized as either: (1) encapsulation or entrapment of the enzyme in
permeable materials; (2) crosslinking of the enzyme via short molecular
linkers; or (3) binding of the enzyme to a carrier material. An example
of the first category includes LentiKat’s (lentil-shaped particles) for
encapsulation of enzymes (Bajić et al., 2017;Cardenas-Fernandez et al.,
2012), whereas cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEAs) are re-
presentative of the second category (Liao et al., 2018; Sheldon et al.,
2013; Wang et al., 2017). The third and most common method entails
the tethering of enzymes on a support material by affinity adsorption,
ionic interactions, or covalent binding. Examples of support materials
for enzyme immobilization are numerous and provide many advantages
in terms of biocatalyst reuse, easier downstream processing and enzyme
stabilization (Mateo et al., 2007; Santos et al., 2015; Silva et al., 2018;
Zdarta et al., 2018). Support materials are often coated with polymeric
structures that bear specific functionalities (such as epoxides or amines)
enabling facile enzyme binding. Covalent interactions have been most
commonly preferred because they minimize enzyme leaching; however,
both the type of carrier material and the method for binding the enzyme
are very important for retaining enzyme activity (Rodrigues et al.,
2013).
Immobilized metal-ion affinity binding is used in many applications,
such as for protein or peptide purification (Ho et al., 2004; Pessela
et al., 2007; Porath, 1992) and immobilization (Cao et al., 2017). This
technique involves the use of metal ions as chelating agents (e.g. Ni
2+,
Co2+/3+, Fe 2+/3+), onto which specific amino acid residues of the
enzyme’s polypeptide chain are coordinated. The chelating metal ions
are chemically connected to the support matrix by spacer molecules.
The interaction between the enzyme and the chelating metal ion center
commonly involves a terminal poly-histidine chain (Hisx-tag), which is
genetically attached to the enzyme prior its recombinant expression in a
microbial host. Although the use of Hisx-tags very often assures a spe-
cific binding between enzyme and metal center, other amino acid re-
sidues can also potentially act as chelators. For instance, a multi-point
attachment of the enzyme to the support can occur if the support ma-
terial contains an elevated number of active groups per surface unit.
This effect is more pronounced if a support with a flat surface area is
used, whereas the incidence is lower if the support is formed by thin
fibers (Santos et al., 2015). The physical properties of the surface of the
support material as well as the number and chemical strength of en-
zyme-support interactions are crucial because a single-point and weak
binding will likely lead to enzyme leaching during the reaction,
whereas an excessive number of strong interactions may result in re-
duced catalytic activity because of considerable distortion of the en-
zyme structure (Mateo et al., 2007). However, immobilized metal-ion
affinity binding through enzyme’s His
x-tag normally guarantees high
retained catalytic activity and stability since a main (desired) orienta-
tion of the enzyme is obtained in most cases, although multi-point at-
tachments could be formed dependent on physical properties and de-
gree of activation of the support material (Santos et al., 2015).
Additionally, these latter non-covalent interactions between the en-
zyme and the surface of the carrier material can contribute to stabilize
enzyme regions whose dynamics are important during the catalytic
cycle (Cassimjee and Federsel, 2018). Moreover, increased apparent
catalytic activity upon immobilization is possible because of the multi-
point binding of pre-formed and catalytically active oligomeric struc-
tures. This feature is particularly important and can be exploited for
hyper-activation of immobilized ω-transaminases (ωTAs), since these
enzymes generally form homodimeric structures in which the active site
consists of shared amino acid residues coming from the two monomeric
units (i.e., the monomeric units are catalytically inactive; Lyskowski
et al., 2014; Malik et al., 2012). It is known that the association be-
tween the two monomeric units of ωTAs can become labile in solution,
particularly in the absence of the pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP) cofactor
(Shin et al., 2003). A useful property of metal-ion affinity binding is the
potential to detach the enzyme from the support material once its ac-
tivity has ceased by using chelating reagents, such as imidazole or
EDTA. Polymeric materials are generally inexpensive; however, high
enzyme loading (> 5% w w
−1, enzyme/carrier) on this type of carrier
is usually unfeasible due to the limited surface area. In this context,
controlled-pore glass (CPG) carriers serve as a better alternative be-
cause of their porous skeleton, which provides a larger surface area for
immobilization and efficient mass transfer through interconnecting
pores.
Recently, a hybrid CPG immobilization material (EziG) was devel-
oped whereby the surface of the CPG is coated with a functionalized
polymer and the resulting polymeric surface bears chelating groups that
are suitable for selective binding of metal ions (Cassimjee and Federsel,
2018; Engelmark Cassimjee and Bäckvall, 2015; Engelmark Cassimjee
et al., 2014). Fe
3+ was selected as preferred metal ion for EziG im-
mobilization material due to its low environmental impact, virtually
absent toxicity and increased binding stability (Cassimjee and Federsel,
2018). The CPG-polymeric functionalized hybrid material creates a
highly porous network for selective binding of enzymes with loadings
up to 30% (w w −1). Moreover, the selectivity of the binding enables
immobilization directly from the cell lysate, thereby precluding the
need for enzyme pre-purification (Engelmark Cassimjee et al., 2014).
Immobilization carriers with high enzyme loadings might cause enzyme
crowding, which can lead to lower enzyme stability (Fernandez-Lopez
et al., 2017); however, such behavior was not observed in any study
conducted with EziG carrier materials. Immobilization on EziG carrier
materials has been reported to significantly improve the stability and
operational window of an arylmalonate decarboxylase (Assmann et al.,
2017), Candida antarcticalipase (Cassimjee et al., 2017), and a norco-
claurine synthase (Lechner et al., 2018). Our group previously reported
the co-immobilization of two dehydrogenases on EziG support material
and the employment of the co-immobilized system in hydrogen-bor-
rowing amination of alcohols to obtain α-chiral amines with improved
efficiency compared to analogous non-immobilized systems (Böhmer
et al., 2018; Knaus and Mutti, 2017; Mutti et al., 2015; Thompson and
Turner, 2017).
ω-Transaminases (ωTAs) are PLP dependent enzymes that produce
α-chiral amines by transferring an amino group from the donor mole-
cule to the carbonyl moiety of the acceptor molecule (Slabu et al.
(2017). Application of ωTAs in large scale processes has been demon-
strated (Savile et al., 2010); however, the moderate operational stabi-
lity upon immobilization hampers the full exploitation of the otherwise
tremendous potential of this class of enzymes in organic synthesis.
Immobilization of ω-transaminases has been reported in a number of
recent studies aimed at improving the overall performance of biocata-
lysts (Abaházi et al., 2018; Alami et al., 2018; Basso et al., 2018; de
Souza et al., 2016d; Jia et al., 2016; Mallin et al., 2014; Neto et al.,
2015; Sun et al., 2017; Truppo et al., 2012). Current limitations appear
to be the relatively low enzyme loading (per mass unit of carrier ma-
terial), as well as the moderate operational stability upon immobiliza-
tion. Co-immobilization of transaminase and PLP cofactor via metal-ion
affinity binding has been recently reported; however, pre-functionali-
zation of the immobilization carrier was required (Benítez-Mateos
et al., 2018).
In this study, we studied the conditions for the optimal im-
mobilization of two stereocomplementary ω-transaminases on EziG
carrier materials based on the use of different types of immobilization
buffers (i.e., composition, concentration, pH) at varied concentrations
of PLP cofactor. The performance of the resulting immobilized bioca-
talysts was then evaluated for the kinetic resolution of rac-α-methyl-
benzylamine (rac-MBA) as a test reaction in both batch- and flow sys-
tems.

2. Material and methods
2.1. Chemicals and carrier materials
Acetophenone, rac-α-methylbenzylamine (rac-α-MBA), (S)-α-me-
thylbenzylamine ((S)-α-MBA), (R)-α-methylbenzylamine ((R)-α-MBA),
and pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
(Steinheim, Germany). Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and sodium pyr-
uvate were purchased from TCI Europe (Zwijndrecht, Belgium). The
following EziG enzyme carrier materials were provided by EnginZyme
AB (Stockholm, Sweden): EziG1 (Fe-Opal); EziG2 (Fe-Coral) and EziG3
(Fe-Amber). Further details for equipment and analytical determination
are available in SI, section 2.
2.2. Expression and purification of ω-transaminases
C-terminal His-tagged (R)-selective ω-transaminase from
Arthrobacter sp. (AsR-ωTA, pET21a) (Iwasaki et al., 2012; Mutti et al.,
2011) and N-terminal His-tagged (S)-selective ω-transaminase from
Chromobacterium violaceum(Cv-ωTA, pET28b) (Kaulmann et al., 2007;
Koszelewski et al., 2010, 2009) were expressed using Escherichia coli
BL21 (DE3) as a host organism: 800 mL of LB medium supplemented
with ampicillin (100 μg mL
−1 for pET21a) or kanamycin (50 μg mL−1
for pET28b) were inoculated with 15 mL of an overnight culture. Cells
were grown at 37 °C until an OD
600 of 0.6 – 0.9 was reached, and the
expression of the proteins was induced by the addition of IPTG (0.5 mM
final concentration). Protein expression was conducted overnight at
25 °C, and after harvesting of the cells (4 °C, 4500 rpm, 15 min), the
remaining cell pellet was re-suspended in Lysis buffer (50 mM KH
2PO4,
300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, pH 8.0). Cells were disrupted by so-
nication and PLP (0.5 mM final concentration) was added to the cell
lysate. After centrifugation (4 °C, 14,000 rpm, 45 min.), the supernatant
was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter and protein purification was per-
formed by Ni-NTA affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA HisTrap FF
columns (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer´s instructions.
After loading of the filtered lysate, the column was washed with suffi-
cient amounts of washing buffer (50 mM KH
2PO4, 300 mM NaCl,
25 mM imidazole, pH 8.0), and the target enzyme was recovered with
elution buffer (50 mM KH
2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 200 mM imidazole, pH
8.0). The process of purification was analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Figure
S1). Fractions containing sufficiently pure protein were pooled and
dialyzed overnight against potassium phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 8).
Protein solutions were concentrated and their concentrations were de-
termined spectrophotometrically using a Bradford assay (see SI section
6.2 for details). Protein yields were 285 mg L
−1 of cell culture
(36 mg g−1 cell pellet) for AsR-ωTA and 100 mg L −1 of cell culture
(30 mg g−1 cell pellet) for Cv-ωTA. Enzymes were shock-frozen in li-
quid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.
2.3. Optimized conditions for immobilization on EziG carrier materials
(analytical scale)
A vial containing 10 ± 0.2 mg of EziG carrier material was cooled
down in an ice bath and suspended in the immobilization buffer (MOPS,
1 mL, 100 mM, pH 7.5) supplemented with 0.1 mM PLP. Purified ω-TA
(1 or 2 mg, equal to 10–20% w w
−1, enzyme loading to support ma-
terial) was added to the suspension, and the mixture was shaken with
an orbital shaker (120 rpm) for 2 h at 4 °C. Small aliquots from the
aqueous phase (20 μL) were sampled before and after the immobiliza-
tion procedure, their concentrations were determined using the
Bradford assay (see SI section 6.2 for details), and the immobilization
yield was calculated (see SI section 3 for details). The immobilized
enzyme was left to sediment, the buffer was removed by pipetting, and
the immobilized enzyme was used directly in biotransformations.
The same procedure was followed for immobilization at a larger
scale, typically using 15 mg of purified ωTA and 100 mg of EziG carrier
material. Full immobilization was obtained after 1.5 h (final enzyme
loading per carrier material 15%, w w
−1).
2.4. Optimized conditions for kinetic resolution with EziG-immobilized ω-
transaminases
EziG-immobilized ω-transaminases (EziG
3-AsR or EziG 3-Cv, 10 or
20%, w w−1, enzyme loading per unit carrier material) were employed
for the kinetic resolution of rac-α-MBA with pyruvate as the amino-
group acceptor (Scheme 1). Batch reactions were performed on analy-
tical scale (0.5 mL) at 30 °C from 15 min or up to 3 h, depending on the
type of experiment.
All stock aqueous solutions were prepared in HEPES buffer
(250 mM, pH 7). EziG-immobilized ω-transaminase (10 ± 0.2 mg, 10
or 20%, w w
−1, enzyme loading to support material) was suspended in
HEPES buffer (112.5 μL, 250 mM, pH 7), to which 12.5 μL of a 1 mM
PLP stock solution (final concentration in solution 25 μM) was added,
along with 125 μL of a 200 mM sodium pyruvate stock solution (final
concentration in solution 50 mM) and 250 μL of a 200 mM rac-α-MBA
stock solution in DMSO/HEPES buffer (final concentration rac-α-MBA
100 mM and DMSO 5%, v v
−1). The reactions were shaken at 30 °C in
an Eppendorf thermomixer (750 rpm). The immobilized enzyme was
left to sediment and the reaction mixture was separated from the bio-
catalyst by pipetting. The reaction mixture was basified with KOH
(100 μL, 5 M) and extracted with EtOAc (2 x 500 μL), and the combined
organic phase was dried over MgSO
4. Analysis of the samples for con-
version determination was conducted using GC-FID equipped with an
achiral column (see SI section 2 for analytical details). For the de-
termination of the enantiomeric excess, derivatization of the samples
was performed with 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP, 50 mg mL
−1) in
acetic anhydride (100 μL per sample) shaken with an orbital shaker
(170 rpm) for 30 min at 25 °C. The samples were quenched by adding
water (300 μL) and shaken again (170 rpm) for 30 min at 25 °C. The
organic layer was collected, dried over MgSO
4, and enantiomeric excess

was measured on GC equipped with a chiral column (see SI section 2 for
analytical details).
2.5. In-flow immobilization from purified enzyme solution
AsR-ωTA (15 mg, 403 nmol of purified enzyme) was diluted in
MOPS buffer (10 mL, 100 mM, pH 7.5) supplemented with 0.1 mM PLP
in an ice bath at 4 °C. A stainless steel column (50 mm length x 2 mm
diameter) was filled with EziG material (100 mg) and hydrated by
flowing MOPS buffer into the column (50 mL, 100 mM, pH 7.5, flow
0.5 mL min−1). Then, the diluted stock solution of AsR-ωTA was loaded
onto the column using a peristaltic pump (flow rate = 300 μL min−1).
MOPS buffer (30 mL, 100 mM, pH 7.5) was flowed through the column
to wash out any possibly unbound protein. Buffer samples (20 μL) of the
loading enzyme solution and of the flow-through obtained during
washing were taken and the enzyme concentration was measured in
both samples using the Bradford assay (see SI section 6.2 for details) in
order to calculate the immobilization yield (see SI section 3 for details).
Immobilization was quantitative; thus, the final enzyme loading per
unit of carrier material was 15% enzyme loading, w w−1. The column
containing EziG-AsR was conditioned by flowing HEPES buffer (30 mL,
250 mM, pH 7, 25 μM PLP, flow 0.5 mL min
−1) and subsequently
mounted on a Dionex P680 HPLC pump unit equipped with flow con-
troller. This set-up was used for continuous flow kinetic resolution ex-
periments.
2.6. In-flow immobilization from crude cell extract (i.e.,cell lysate)
Immobilization directly from cell lysate of ωTA is of particular in-
terest for large scale application and was performed as follows. While
cooling at 4 °C on an ice bath, anE. colipellet containing overexpressed
AsR-ωTA (0.62 g of cells, 36 mg g
−1 cells) was suspended in MOPS
buffer (6 mL, 100 mM, pH 7.5) and disrupted by sonication. The cell
debris was removed by centrifugation (4 °C, 14,000 rpm, 45 min), and
the soluble fraction containing the enzyme (23% w w −1 to carrier
material) was filtered (0.45 μm filter pores). A stainless-steel column
(50 mm length x 2 mm diameter) was filled with EziG
3 Fe-Amber
(100 mg) and hydrated with MOPS buffer (50 mL, 100 mM, pH 7.5,
flow 0.5 mL min
−1). The soluble protein fraction was loaded onto the
column using a peristaltic pump (flow rate = 150 μL min−1, residence
time 63 s). After complete loading (6 mL), the flow was stopped, and the
cell lysate was left to incubate in the column for 45 min at 20 °C. We
noticed that this incubation time somehow resulted in the avoidance of
even minor enzyme leaching during the subsequent washing steps and
reaction. Then, MOPS buffer (50 mL, 100 mM, pH 7.5, flow 0.5 mL
min−1) was flowed through the column to wash out any possibly un-
bound component (e.g. endogenous E. coliproteins). The column con-
taining the immobilized AsR-ωTA was conditioned by flowing further
with HEPES buffer (30 mL, 250 mM, pH 7, 25 μM PLP) and subse-
quently mounted on a Dionex P680 HPLC pump unit equipped with
flow controller. The amount of immobilized AsR-ωTA per unit of carrier
EziG material was calculated to be 19%, w w−1 based on the difference
between protein content in the loading fraction and protein content in
the washing fractions (via Bradford assay). The determination through
quantitative analysis of protein fractions on SDS PAGE yielded the same
result.
2.7. Continuous flow kinetic resolution with EziG-immobilized ω-
transaminases
ω-Transaminase was immobilized on EziG carrier material (100 mg
carrier plus enzyme, 15% loading w w
−1) in a stainless-steel column
(50 mm length x 2 mm diameter). A Dionex P680 HPLC pump unit was
flushed with HEPES buffer (250 mM, pH 7, 25 μM PLP). The column
containing EziG-ωTA was connected to the flow system and heated up
to 30 °C in a water bath.
The reaction mixture was prepared as follows. Sodium pyruvate
(5.4 g, 49.5 mmol, 55 mM final concentration) was dissolved in HEPES
buffer (900 mL final volume, 250 mM, pH 7), andrac-α-MBA (11.6 mL,
10.9 g, 90 mmol, 100 mM final concentration) was pre-dissolved in
DMSO (final cosolvents concentration 10% v v
−1) prior to addition to
the HEPES buffer containing the sodium pyruvate. Then, the pH was
adjusted to pH 7 and PLP (25 μM final concentration) was added. The
solution was stirred for 1 h at RT in the dark. The reaction mixture was
pumped through the column (average flow rate: 0.175 mL min
−1), and
the product mixture was collected in fractions (ca. 8 mL each hour
during the first day of operation, and then 200 mL during nighttime and
100 mL during the daytime). The column was operated for 96 con-
secutive hours without any detectable decrease of catalytic perfor-
mance. A small aliquot of each fraction (0.5 mL) was basified with KOH
(100 μL, 5 M) and extracted with EtOAc (2 × 500 μL). The organic
layers were combined, dried over MgSO
4 and analyzed with GC
equipped with an achiral column (see SI section 2 for analytical details).
GC-analysis showed that the kinetic resolution proceeded quantitatively
(> 49% conversion). The final work-up was performed by initial
acidification of the combined collected product fractions to pH 2 with
HCl (37%), followed by extraction of the acetophenone byproduct with
MTBE (3 x 300 mL). Then, the aqueous phase was basified to pH 14
with KOH (5 M), and the product was extracted with MTBE
(3 x 300 mL). The combined organic phase was dried over MgSO
4 and
the solvent was removed by reduced pressure to obtain 5.05 g of pure
(S)-α-MBA (42 mmol, 93% isolated yield) in perfect optical purity
(> 99% ee).
2.8. SEM analysis
Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) of EziG material with im-
mobilized AsR-ωTA were obtained with a FEI Verios 460 scanning
electron microscope in secondary-electron mode. An acceleration vol-
tage of 2–5 kV was used with a beam current of 100 pA at a working
distance of 4 mm, and the field immersion mode was applied for an
optimized resolution. Samples were placed onto an aluminum stub with
carbon film and dried for several hours at 40 °C under vacuum before
measurement. Selected samples were also sputter-coated with a layer of
Cr (20 nm).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Enzyme expression and purification
Among the pool of available ω-transaminases, we chose two ste-
reocomplementary enzymes for the immobilization studies: 1) the (R)-
selective ω-transaminase from Arthrobacter species (AsR-ωTA) (Iwasaki
et al., 2012; Mutti et al., 2011); and 2) the (S)-selective ω-transaminase
from Chromobacterium violaceum (Cv-ωTA) (Kaulmann et al., 2007;
Koszelewski et al., 2010, 2009). Both enzymes have been extensively
studied in the past decade and display perfect stereoselectivities for the
amination of a large number of structurally diverse prochiral ketones.
Although not technically required and actually inconvenient for an
applied industrial process, we decided to use purified enzymes for this
study due to the high accuracy and precision in quantifying the re-
sulting actual amount of immobilized enzyme on the carrier material.
In this manner, an exact evaluation of the catalytic performance (e.g.,
TON or initial activity) was possible. Nonetheless, the efficiency for the
selective immobilization of ωTA from crude lysate on EziG
3 was de-
monstrated as described in “Material and methods” (Section 2.6).
Specifically, the final enzyme loading on carrier material was 19% w
w
−1, which correlates to an estimated yield of immobilization from cell
lysate of ca. 90% (without optimization). In a previous study, enzyme
loading up to 29% (w w

w−1 for batch reactions and 15% w w −1 for flow reactions, respec-
tively.
3.2. EziG carrier materials
Three types of EziG enzyme carrier material possessing distinct
surface properties were tested for initial experiments: EziG1 (Fe-Opal),
has a hydrophilic derivatized silica surface; EziG2 (Fe-Coral) has a hy-
drophobic surface polymer; and EziG 3 (Fe-Amber) is covered with a
semi-hydrophobic polymer surface (see SI, Table S2 for EziG product
specifications). Fig. 1 displays scanning electron microscope (SEM)
images of EziG 3 Fe-Amber material, which show the presence of a
highly porous network with a large surface area. Bead size distribution
and shapes are in accordance with the product specifications (see SI).
3.3. Immobilization of ω-transaminases
Immobilization of ω-transaminases AsR-ωTA and Cv-ωTA was per-
formed by incubating the desired amount of enzyme in buffer supplied
with EziG carrier material. The progress of immobilization was mon-
itored in time by using a Bradford assay to measure the amount of
enzyme remaining in the immobilization buffer (see SI, section 6 for
details). The progress of the immobilization was evinced visually in that
the EziG carrier material turned increasingly yellow during incubation
due to the presence of the (yellow) PLP cofactor bound in the active site
of the enzyme. AsR-ωTA was immobilized under standard im-
mobilization conditions on EziG carrier materials within 2 h of in-
cubation (Fig. 2A and Table S3). Affinity binding of AsR-ωTA on the
three EziG carrier materials, namely EziG
1-AsR, EziG2-AsR, and EziG3-
AsR depending on the carrier type, proved to be strong, as there was no
detectable loss of enzyme from the carrier material even after in-
cubating the immobilized enzyme in buffer up to 3 days. Longer in-
cubation times were not tested.
3.4. Influence of buffer concentration (i.e., related ionic strength) and PLP
concentration on the immobilization process
The ionic strength of the immobilization buffer greatly influences
the immobilization efficiency of many carrier materials. For example,
researchers have reported improvements in covalent coupling of en-
zymes to epoxy-activated carriers by using high ionic buffer strength. In
a first step, a salt-induced association takes place between the macro-
molecule and the support surface (Mateo et al., 2002; Wheatley and
Schmidt, 1999), which increases the effective concentration of nu-
cleophilic groups on the protein close to the epoxide reactive sites.
However, the salt concentration needed to immobilize an enzyme was
reported to be highly protein-dependent (Wheatley and Schmidt, 1999).
Hence, we wondered about the influence of buffer concentration in the
case of metal-ion affinity immobilization with EziG carriers. Im-
mobilization tests of ωTAs on EziG carriers were performed in KPi
buffer (pH 8) with a buffer concentration ranging from 100 mM to 1 M.
Fig. 2B shows that buffer concentrations above 100 mM had a negative
influence on the immobilization process; however, the behavior of the
immobilization yield of AsR-ωTA versus the buffer concentration de-
pended on the type of EziG carrier. The effect on EziG
1 (Fe-Opal) was
dramatic, with virtual no immobilization above a concentration of
600 mM KPi. Conversely, EziG
2 (Fe-Coral) and EziG 3 (Fe-Amber) be-
haved similarly to each other, resulting in a residual 60% immobiliza-
tion yield at 1 M KPi (Fig. 2B and Table S4). Thus, the immobilization
process is somewhat dependent on the physico-chemical properties of
the surface of the carrier material, albeit the type of immobilization is
the same (i.e., Fe-cation affinity to enzyme His
6-tag). We also specu-
lated that phosphate ions might compete with the enzyme for the
binding to the Fe-cations that are chelated to the EziG carrier material.
Interestingly, although the stability of free AsR-ωTA in solution at high
ionic strength was not tested in a specifically designed experiment, no
precipitation of enzyme was observed during the immobilization

procedure even at 1 M KPi buffer.
PLP plays an important role not only as a cofactor, but also in
contributing to the stabilization of the catalytically active dimeric form
of the enzyme, whereas the monomeric form is inactive (Chen et al.,
2016; Lyskowski et al., 2014; Malik et al., 2012). In order to maintain
the dimeric active form of the enzyme, an excess of PLP is commonly
supplied during biotransformations with non-immobilized ωTA (5–10
eq. of PLP to the enzyme) (Slabu et al., 2017). During our preliminary
experiments, AsR-ωTA and Cv-ωTA were immobilized in solution, as
active biocatalysts in the presence of externally added PLP. However,
we hypothesized that the concentration of PLP could have a dual im-
pact, such that although adding a surplus of PLP during the im-
mobilization procedure might be beneficial for retaining the activity of
ωTAs, high concentrations of PLP might also hamper the immobiliza-
tion process, as the PLP could also interact with the metal cationic
centers of the EziG carrier. Accordingly, EziG carrier materials were
separately incubated in 100 mM KPi buffers at varied concentrations of
PLP (0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 1, 2, 3, and 5 mM) for 30 min prior to addition of
the enzyme. Fig. 2C shows the dramatic negative effect related to the
use of an excess of PLP. Among the three tested EziG carriers, EziG
1 was
the most affected by higher buffer concentration (Fig. 2B) and the least
affected by higher PLP concentration (Fig. 2C). As a general conclusion,
for obtaining high immobilization yields, the PLP had to be kept below
0.1 mM (Fig. 2C and Table S5). Precipitation of enzyme was not ob-
served in any of the experiments. Among the three tested EziG carriers,
EziG3 (Fe-Amber) provided the optimal immobilization yield when
using 100 mM KPi buffer supplemented with 0.1 mM PLP. Therefore,
EziG
3 was selected for the biocatalytic studies.
3.5. Influence of type of buffer and pH on the immobilization process
Both the buffer type and its pH value determine the nature of the
ionogenic environment around the enzyme. Consequently, the im-
mobilization buffer can significantly influence the stability and activity
of the immobilized enzyme. EziG
3-AsR was immobilized as previously
described in four different types of buffers at 100 mM concentration
(MOPS pH 8.0, KPi pH 8.0, HEPES pH 8.0 and Tris pH 8.0), and the
resulting biocatalyst activity was determined for the kinetic resolution
of rac-α-MBA with 0.5 equiv. of pyruvate (Scheme 1). Immobilization
in MOPS buffer resulted in the highest observed activity of 365 U
μmol
−1
enzyme (Fig. 2D and Table S6). Conversely, a more than four-fold
decrease in activity was observed using EziG3-AsR originated from the
immobilization in Tris buffer (83 U μmol −1
enzyme). Interestingly, im-
mobilizations in MOPS buffer at pH 6.5, 7 or 7.5 did not significantly
affect the initial catalytic activity (379 U μmol−1
enzyme, 323 U μmol−1
enzyme
and 365 U μmol−1
enzyme
, respectively; for details; see Table S7). However,
immobilization in MOPS buffer at pH 6 showed a significant drop in
activity to 192 U μmol−1
enzyme. Lower pH values were not tested due to
the reported instability of AsR-ωTA below pH 6 (Iwasaki et al., 2012).
3.6. Studies on single batch kinetic resolution of rac-α-MBA catalyzed by
ωTAs immobilized on EziG3
3.6.1. Preliminary considerations on immobilization and reaction
temperatures
A preliminary study using AsR-ωTA as free enzyme in solution
displayed slightly lower enzyme activity at 40 °C and significantly de-
creased enzyme activity at 50 °C (Figure S2 and Table S11). On the
other hand, both EziG 3-AsR (i.e., immobilized enzyme) and AsR-ωTA
(i.e., isolated enzyme) evinced no detectable loss of activity upon in-
cubation for 3 days at RT. Accordingly, we decided to perform all of the
biotransformations at 30 °C.
3.6.2. Initial tests for activity of immobilized ωTAs
AsR-ωTA and Cv-ωTA immobilized on EziG 3 Fe-Amber, namely
EziG3-AsR and EziG 3-Cv, respectively, were employed in preliminary
experiments for the kinetic resolution ofrac-α-MBA (100 mM) with 0.5
eq. of pyruvate (Scheme 1). EziG3-AsR (10 mg, 10% enzyme loading, w
w−1) showed high activity for the substrate, and perfect kinetic re-
solution of rac-α-MBA was reached within 5 min (> 49% conversion
and > 99%ee of unreacted (S)-α-MBA; Fig. 3 A and Table S7) with a
calculated TON above 900 for this single batch reaction (see SI section 3
for details on calculations and terminology). A similar reaction con-
ducted with the same amount of purified AsR-ωTA in solution required
2 min in order to reach full kinetic resolution (Table S8). EziG 3-Cv
(10 mg, 10% enzyme loading, w w −1) catalyzed perfect resolution of
rac-α-MBA (> 49% conversion and > 99%ee of unreacted (R)-α-MBA;
Fig. 3 B and Table S9) within 3 h reaction time with a TON above 1300.
We attribute the lower reaction rate of EziG3-Cv compared with EziG3-
AsR to a lower intrinsic catalytic activity of Cv-ωTA for (S)-α-MBA and
the lower molar loading of the enzyme (i.e., MW AsR-ωTA = 37.2 KDa;
MW Cv-ωTA = 53.6 KDa). In fact, the similar reaction with the same

amount of purified Cv-ωTA in solution also required at least 2 h for
complete kinetic resolution of rac-α-MBA (Table S10). Comparing the
preliminary experiments of kinetic resolution using either free enzyme
in solution or immobilized enzyme, we noticed that the apparent rate of
the reaction is moderately higher when using the former. This phe-
nomenon must not be attributed to a lower intrinsic catalytic activity of
the immobilized biocatalysts. In fact, when operating with immobilized
enzymes in an aqueous environment, reagents and biocatalyst are in
different phases (i.e., heterogeneous catalysis), and therefore mass
transfer (i.e., external as well as inside the pores of the carrier) influ-
ences the overall kinetics of the process. This is particularly valid for the
kinetic resolution of rac-α-MBA, which has an elevated reaction rate in
homogeneous aqueous systems (Shin and Kim, 1998). Accordingly, the
preliminary experiments must be simply interpreted as a proof of highly
retained catalytic activity of the ω-transaminases upon immobilization.
These conclusions correlate with the experiments at high substrate
loading reported in the next section.
3.6.3. High substrate loading performance of EziG
3-AsR
Substrate feed is often a limiting factor for implementation of bio-
catalysts in large scale processes. As immobilized EziG3-AsR biocatalyst
proved to be highly active in preliminary experiments, we performed
kinetic resolution at higher concentrations of substrate (Fig. 4 and
Table S13; see SI for experimental details). The resolution ofrac-α-MBA
was observed with increasing productivity up to 600 mM substrate
concentration (TON = 2450 for a single batch reaction). Substrate and
co-product inhibition are common limitations in ω-transaminase-cata-
lyzed reactions, which explains the observed drop in conversion at
substrate concentration values above 600 mM (Gomm and O’Reilly,
2018).
3.7. Biocatalyst recycling
The main advantage related to enzyme immobilization is the po-
tential for recycling the biocatalysts for subsequent batch reactions. An
amount of EziG 3-AsR (10 mg, 10% enzyme loading, w w −1) was re-
peatedly employed for the kinetic resolution of rac-α-MBA (initial
concentration per cycle 100 mM) with sodium pyruvate (50 mM). Each
cycle of batch reaction was run for 15 min. At the end of each cycle, the
reaction buffer was separated from the biocatalyst and worked-up.
Then, the same batch of EziG 3-AsR biocatalyst was re-suspended in
fresh buffer containing the reagents and additional PLP (25 μM), and
another reaction cycle was initiated. This procedure was repeated for
16 reaction cycles, maintaining quantitative conversion in the kinetic
resolution using the immobilized enzyme (Fig. 5 and Table S14). Con-
sidering the short reaction time per cycle employed (15 min), this

experiment demonstrated the robustness of the reaction system. In
total, 388 μM (S)-α-MBA (> 99%ee) was produced with a total TON of
14,400. Interestingly, when no additional PLP (25 μM) was supplied in
each cycle, conversions dropped slightly (approximately 3% per cycle),
thus indicating that the specific minimal addition of PLP is beneficial
for retaining long-term catalytic activity (data not shown).
3.8. In-flow immobilization and continuous flow kinetic resolution
Chemical synthesis using immobilized biocatalysts in continuous
flow systems is particularly attractive in terms of practicality, re-
producibility and improved productivity compared to batch reaction
systems. In this context, in-flow immobilization of AsR-ωTA (15 mg)
was performed in a stainless-steel column (50 mm length x 2 mm dia-
meter) filled with EziG
3 Fe-Amber beads (100 mg; see “Material and
methods” (Section 2.6) for details). The flow reactor (total volume
157 μL) was then applied in continuous flow for the kinetic resolution
of rac-α-MBA (10.9 g, 100 mM) with sodium pyruvate (0.55 equiv.;
Scheme 2). The reaction buffer mixture was pumped through the
column at an average rate of 0.175 mL min −1 (average space time =
54 s) using a Dionex P680 HPLC pump unit. The flow-through was
collected in separate 100–200 mL fractions and analytical samples were
analyzed by GC. The packed-bed flow reactor was operated for 96
consecutive hours without any detectable loss of catalytic performance,
and the kinetic resolution proceeded with perfect enantioselectivity
(> 49% conversion, > 99%ee of unreacted (S)-α-MBE). The calculated
TON was above 110,000 and the space-time yield was 335 g L −1 h−1.
After work-up, 5.05 g (42 mmol) of (S)-α-MBA were obtained in high
chemical and optical purity (93% isolated yield, > 99% ee; see SI).
4. Conclusion
In this study, we implemented ω-transaminases as highly active
heterogeneous biocatalysts in the production of an α-chiral amine by
kinetic resolution. Our investigation into the immobilization conditions
proved critical for obtaining highly active biocatalysts. The optimal
conditions for immobilization on EziG carrier were found to be the use
of 100 mM MOPS buffer supplemented with 0.1 mM PLP. The funda-
mental design of EziG allowed us to reach high loading of enzyme per
mass unit of carrier material (20%, w w −1). Under the optimized
conditions, the immobilized enzyme was recycled for 16 consecutive
batch reactions (15 min reaction time per batch), always affording
quantitative conversion. Finally, multi-gram scale continuous flow
production of (S)-α-MBA was performed in a packed-bed flow reactor
for 96 consecutive hours without any detectable loss of enzymatic ac-
tivity. Within the short timeframe of our experiment, the chemical
turnover number reached a value higher than 110,000 and a space-time
yield of 335 g L
−1 h−1. It is noteworthy that erosion of the exquisite
enantioselectivity of the immobilized ωTA was never observed during
operation in either batch- or continuous flow biocatalysis. This research
highlights the potential of continuous flow biocatalysis, by selective
immobilization of enzymes onto functionalized controlled-pore glass
beads through reversible metal-cation affinity binding, for industrial
manufacturing of high value chemicals.
