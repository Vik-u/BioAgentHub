ABSTRACT
Bacterial retrons consist of a reverse transcriptase
(RT) and a contiguous non-coding RNA (ncRNA)
gene. One third of annotated retrons carry additional
open reading frames (ORFs), the contribution and
signiﬁcance of which in retron biology remains to
be determined. In this study we developed a com-
putational pipeline for the systematic prediction of
genes speciﬁcally associated with retron RTs based
on a previously reported large dataset representa-
tive of the diversity of prokaryotic RTs. We found
that retrons generally comprise a tripartite system
composed of the ncRNA, the RT and an additional
protein or RT -fused domain with diverse enzymatic
functions. These retron systems are highly modular,
and their components have coevolved to different ex-
tents. Based on the additional module, we classiﬁed
retrons into 13 types, some of which include addi-
tional variants. Our ﬁndings provide a basis for fu-
ture studies on the biological function of retrons and
for expanding their biotechnological applications.
INTRODUCTION
Reverse transcriptases (RTs, also known as ‘RNA-
dependent DNA polymerases’) were discovered in 1970,
by Temin and Baltimore, in tumor viruses (1,2). These
enzymes are present in the three domains of life capable
of polymerizing cDNA from an RNA template. They
are known principally as a key component of eukaryotic
mobile retrotransposons (3) and retroviruses (4), but they
are also widely distributed among bacterial and archaeal
species.
Prokaryotic RTs were not discovered until 1989, when
they were identified as components of retrons, respon-
sible for the production of short single-stranded linear
DNA fragments (5,6). RTs were subsequently shown to be
presentindiversity-generatingretroelements(DGRs)( 7,8),
abortive phage infection (Abi) systems (9–11), CRISPR-
Cassystems( 12–19)andgroupIIintrons,thislastcategory

associatedRTs,Abi-likeandotheryetuncharacterizedRTs,
such as the G2L (group II-like) or UG (unknown) groups.
Retrons are defined by their unique ability to produce
an unusual satellite DNA known as msDNA (multicopy
single-stranded DNA) (24), the function of which remains
unknown. They consist of∼2000 bp of DNA including
anRT-codinggene( ret)andcontiguousinvertedsequences
(msr and msd). The msr/msd regions and theretgene are
transcribed as a single RNA, which is folded into a spe-
cificsecondarystructure.Oncetranslated,theRTbindsthe

different sequences, but common structural features, which
are thought to be involved in retron function. The external

Our knowledge of the mechanism of msDNA genera-
tion is derived from studies of 38 non-redundant msDNA-
producingretrons,only16ofwhichcontainfullyannotated
and experimentally validated msr-msd-RT cassettes (28).
About one third of all annotated retrons are predicted to
haveadditionalopenreadingframes(ORFs)encodingpro-
teins of unknown function, some of which have been an-
notated as adenosine-binding proteins or cold-shock pro-
teins (30). The significance of these proteins, and their role
in retron biology, remain to be determined.
Despite numerous characterizationsin vitroand in vivo,
very little is known about the biology of retrons, and their
putative function has remained a mystery for almost 30
years (31). Here, we develop a computational pipeline for
the systematic prediction of genes specifically associated
with retron RTs, and report that most bacterial retrons are
tripartite systems including, in addition to the (msr-msd)
ncRNA gene and the RT, a primary protein-coding gene
or RT-fused domain. The predicted functions of this third
componentarehighlydiverse.Thethreecomponentsofthe
retron systems display an extraordinary modularity, prob-
ably expanding their functional and mechanistic diversity,
but comparisons between the phylogenies obtained for the
ncRNA, the RT and the associated proteins suggest that
theyhavecoevolved,providingadditionalevidenceinfavor
of a functional association. Clustering on the basis of the
genes encoding these associated proteins or RT-fused do-
mains groups retron systems into 13 types, some of which
include additional subtypes or variants.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Prokaryotic reverse transcriptase datasets
ThedatasetofprokaryoticRTsusedforthesystematicpre-
diction of genes specifically associated with retron RTs re-
ported here consisted of a previously published dataset of
9141uniquerepresentativeentriesderivedfromthecluster-
ing, at 85% sequence identity, of 198 760 annotated reverse
transcriptases obtained from different databases (17). This
dataset contains group-II introns (47%), retron/retron-like
(25%) and DGRs RT sequences (12%), the remaining 16%
clustering into distinct groups including RTs linked to
CRISPR-Cas systems, Abi-like RTs and uncharacterized
RTs grouped into the G2L (group II-like) and UG groups
(17). The specific retron dataset further analyzed in this
studycomprises1912retron /retron-likeRTsequencesfrom
thedatasetdescribedaboveand16RTsfromexperimentally
validated retrons (28) (Supplementary Table S1).
Clustering of neighboring proteins
TheORFslocatedwithin ± 30kbofeachRTwereretrieved
and clustered with the MMseqs2 suite (32). Sequences of
<30 amino acids (aa) or>3000 aa were discarded from
theanalysisduetopoordownstreamclustering.Connected
component clustering was first performed, to cover re-
mote homologs. We then performed deeper iterative cas-
caded searches until convergence, to merge close clusters
and to cover more remote homologs with the mmseqs
search and mmseqs result2profile utilities (https://github.
com/soedinglab/MMseqs2/wiki).Thisprocedureyielded62
277 clusters, 5413 of which had more than five members.
Prediction of functional association
We encoded the neighborhood of the 9141 RTs, by con-
structingapresence /absencematrix,inwhichtherowscor-
responded to the RTs ordered by the position on the tree,
and the columns corresponded to the various neighboring
proteinclusters,orderedbysize.Thismatrixwasfurtheran-
alyzedbycomputingtwoparametersprovidinganestimate
of the non-random distribution of every cluster across the
tree.
Wefirstcalculatedthedensityofproteinoccurrencefora

umn (bandwidth= 50, steps= 1) and normalizing the val-
uesobtainedwiththemovingaverageandmovingstandard
deviation of 10 000 random permutations for each cluster
size. We set a cutoff value for statistical significance of the
mean value plus four times the standard deviation for the
randompermutations.Inordertonormalizedifferentclus-
ters by their size, we calculated a parameter (hereafter re-
ferred as phyvalue) consisting of the ratio of the sliding av-
erage to the selected cutoff. We only retained clusters for
which the maximum ratio was at least 2, and we further di-
vided each cluster into subclusters separated by>10 posi-
tions below the cutoff. Using this parameter, we identified

131proteinsubclustersassociatedwithretronRTs.Wethen
took into account the background similarity between RTs
in the phylogenetic tree due to the underlying speciation
events, by calculating sequence identity for each group of
RTsassociatedwithagivensubcluster.Basedontheneigh-
boringclustersfoundinthevicinityofothergroupsofRTs,
we established a cutoff of 60% for considering this nonran-
dom colocalization to be probably functional (i.e. groups
of RTs with a sequence identity below this value were con-
sidered to be different enough for the association to be sig-
nificant). By adding this second parameter, we were able to
decrease the number of protein subclusters predicted to be
associatedwithretronRTsto71(SupplementaryTableS2).
Reannotation of the genomic neighborhood
Foreachcluster,amultiplesequencealignment(MSA)was
built with MAFFT (33), using the parameters –globalpair
–maxiterate1000–reorder,andhiddenMarkov-modelpro-
tein profiles were built with hmmbuild from the HMMER
suite(http://hmmer.org/).Usingtheseprofiles,weranacus-
tom script written in python 3.6 (17) that uses hmmsearch
to annotate the ORFs in the vicinity of RTs and retrieves

AnalysisandpredictionofretronRT-associatedproteinfunc-
tion
Remote sequence homology was detected on representa-
tive sequences from each cluster and subcluster analyzed,
with HHpred and HHblits (34,35) for sequence-based pre-
dictionsofproteinfunctionandstructure.Proteindomains
within sequences were identified with InterPro (36), Pfam
(37) and SMART (38).
Protein structure prediction
Protein structure modelling was performed on different
retron RTs-associated proteins in order to support the
sequence-based functional prediction by selecting and sub-
mitting representative sequences of each cluster indepen-
dentlytotheRaptorX( 39),Phyre2( 40),I-TASSER( 41,42)
and trRosetta (43) prediction servers. Best quality struc-
tural models were selected according to the quality criteria
ofeachserverforfurtherstructure-basedfunctionalpredic-
tions. Visualization of the models and structural alignment
was performed in PyMOL Molecular Graphics System V2
(Schr¨odinger, LLC). In order to infer plausible functions
of the unknown modelled proteins, structural homologs
with described functions were identified by performing a
structure-based similarity search against all protein struc-
tures deposited in the PDB with the DALI server (44)a n d
with the PDBeFold service (45).
Phylogenetic analyses
We used MAFFT software (33) and progressive methods
for MSAs. For retron RT phylogeny, a MSA was con-
structed corresponding to the RT0–7 domain of 1,912 RT
sequences from the 9141-entry dataset previously classified
asretron/retron-likeRTs(17)plus16RTsfromexperimen-
tally validated retrons (28). Representative alignments of
associated proteins were obtained with ESPript 3.0 (46).

Detection of structured RNAs
We used CMfinder 0.4.1 (50)a n dR - s c a p e(51) to design
a pipeline consisting of several sequential steps for the de-
tection of structured RNAs in the vicinity of retron RT se-
quences. We first used each experimentally confirmed msr-
msd transcript and its close relatives as seeds for CMfinder
0.4.1, an RNA motif prediction tool using statistical mea-
sures for structure prediction based on a combination of
folding energy and sequence covariation. We then built co-
variate models with cmbuild from the Infernal suite (52),
and used these models to search for similar structures up-
stream and downstream from the start of the RT gene.
In groups in which no validated msr-msd transcripts were
previously described, we manually searched for structured
regions with features similar to those described for other
msr-msd transcripts in the vicinity of RT-coding genes us-
ing RNAfold (53), and we built multiple alignments with
MAFFT-Q-INS-i (33), with the aim of locating conserved
sequences in closely related genomes. We then trimmed the
alignments in the a1 and a2 regions, and repeated steps of
theprocessuptotheretrievalofupstreamanddownstream
sequences.Finally,weusedR-scape( 51)todescribecovary-
ing base pairs in the proposed consensus structures and to
reduce the relative weight of phylogenetic correlations and
base composition biases not due to conserved RNA struc-
ture.
Coevolution analysis
We studied the coevolution of different components of
different retron systems, by building multiple alignments
with MAFFT-FFT-NS-i/Q-INS-I and inferring phyloge-
netic trees with IQ-TREE (48) (default parameters and -
B 1000) for the various groups of RTs, clusters and pro-
posed msr-msd transcripts. As a way to measure the co-
evolution between the different components of the retrons,
we compared the trees distances between the components
of the retron tripartite system and that for the correspond-
ing 16S RNAs retrieved from the SILVA database (54). We
use 16S RNAs trees to check if the co-evolution is due to a
functionalassociationorifthesimilaritycomesfromback-
ground similarity between the components due to the un-
derlying speciation events themselves. To this end, we com-
puted the cophenetic correlation of the branch length dis-
tances (55) using R 3.6 and the packagedendextend(56).

(domains RT0–7) of 1912 retron/retron-like RT sequences
from the above dataset and 16 additional RTs from experi-
mentally validated retrons (28) revealed that they could be
groupedinto11well-supportedclades(Figure 2AandSup-

asthoseencodedbygroupIIintronsandDGRs,theclades
inferred from the phylogeny of retron RTs displayed strong
support even for the inner nodes (Supplementary File S1)

RTsdisplayedfeaturescharacteristicofretron-typeRTs,in-
cluding region Y and region X (28). Region Y, which is lo-
cated at the C-terminus, contains a highly conserved VTG
triplet within the RT7 domain (with G the most conserved
residue), and directs the RT to its cognate msr. By con-
trast,regionX,locatedbetweentheRT2andRT3domains,
presents a characteristic NAXXH motif (with H the most
conserved residue) and may be essential for reverse tran-
scriptioninitiationorcatalysis(Figure 1).Moreover,16ex-
perimentally validated retrons (28) were found to cluster in
six of the 11 clades identified (Figure2A, Table1 and Sup-
plementary Table S1). These data further support the iden-

The retron ncRNA gene associated with retron/retron-like
RT sequences
Retrons are usually defined as contiguous transcriptional
cassettes encompassing an ncRNA gene containing the
msr and msd regions and a specialized reverse transcrip-
tase (RT) gene (Figure1). Retron msr-msd transcriptional
cassettes have divergent sequences but display substan-
tial structural similarities (28). We, therefore, analyzed the
genomic neighborhood of the retron/retron-like RT se-
quences, searching for conserved RNA secondary struc-
turesresemblingthoseofpreviouslycharacterizedmsr-msd
transcripts. Typically, msr-msd transcripts fold into a char-
acteristicstructureinwhichtheinvertedrepeatsattheends
hybridize,leavingthestructureslocatedinthemsrandmsd
regions in internal positions. The msr region contains one
to three hairpins, whereas the msd region contains a long
stable stem-loop (Figure1). Using covariance models and
consensusstructuredetection,wewereabletoidentifythese
characteristicstructureswithahighdegreeofconfidencein
eightofthe11RTcladesdescribedhere,someofwhichhad
no previous experimentally validated representatives (Fig-
ure 2B and Supplementary Figure S1). Some of the RT
clades had a single consensus structure for the msr-msd
transcript (clades 7 and 8), whereas others (clades 1, 2, 3,
9, 10 and 11) displayed greater structural diversity, with
two or three different consensus structures, highlighting a
modularity of the (msr-msd)-RT cassette. All the proposed
structures display the common features described in previ-
ousstudies,withshorthairpinsinthemsrregionandalong
stem-loop in the msd region. However, some of the above
clades(clades3,7,8and9)havelargesubbranchesinwhich

mentaryTableS1).Nevertheless,wenotedsequenceconser-

possible to rule out the possibility of associated ncRNA
transcripts with unusual structures not resembling that of
canonical msr-msd transcripts. These results reveal an ex-
traordinarydiversityofretronunitsthatcouldnoteasilybe
classified on the basis of the structure of the msr-msd tran-
script or the phylogenetic origin of the RT. The consensus

therefore, account for individual variations that could con-

Prediction of genes functionally associated with retron RTs
and classification of retron systems
The increase in the amount of genomic data available from
public databases has made it possible to develop and use
novel methodologies and analyses, with the aim of predict-
ing functional associations between proteins (57). It is cur-
rently thought that only a third of annotated retrons have
accessory open reading frames (ORFs) of unknown func-
tion (28
). We investigated the range of this association and
the feasibility of predicting genes functionally associated
with retron RTs and separating them from spurious asso-
ciations without bias related to their hypothetical function,
by developing a computational procedure integrating the
previously constructed phylogenetic information based on
the large prokaryotic RT dataset comprising 9141 RT se-
quences (17).
This pipeline consisted of several sequential steps sum-
marized in Figure 3 and Supplementary Figure S3. We
first retrieved all the aa sequences corresponding to an-
notated coding sequences in the vicinity (±30 kb) of the
9141 RTs. We clustered these sequences by deep iterative
comparison,toensurethatremotehomologswerecovered.
This resulted in in 5413 clusters with more than five rep-
resentatives. We assessed the likelihood of these clusters
being associated with RTs, by calculating two parameters:
(i) the non-random distribution of clusters across the tree
(phyvalue) and (ii) the percentage sequence identity of the
RTs involved. Using these two parameters, we were able
to show that the clusters were associated with RTs, includ-
ing those previously reported to be associated with RT-
CRISPR, such as Cas2 (cluster 30) (14,15)( F i g u r e4), and
DGRs such as Avd (cluster 4) (58) (not shown) proteins.
Similarly,theclusterspredictedtobepotentiallyassociated

for each (see Materials and Methods).
This sequence similarity clustering and retron RT se-
quenceanalysisrevealedthatmostretronRTshavenonran-
domly associated specific gene-encoding proteins, whereas
sequence analyses showed that other RTs appear to have
mostly C-terminal additional domains with diverse pre-
dicted functions, many probably related to nucleases, nu-
cleic acid metabolism, DNA /RNA binding, signaling,
membrane proteins and proteases. Taken together, these
results suggest that retrons may broadly be considered to
constitute a tripartite system including a non-coding RNA
(msr-msd)-RT cassette for msDNA production, and an as-
sociated specific protein or additional domain fused to the
RT of potential relevance for determining the functionality
of the retron unit. Retron systems can be clustered into 13
types, some of which include additional subtypes or vari-
ants, on the basis of the associated protein-coding genes or
domains fused to the retron RT (Figure5and Table1).
Modularity of retron systems
We found associated proteins or fused domains with dis-
tinct predicted functions within a particular RT clade (Ta-
ble 1). For example, the RTs of clade 1 were associated
with NDTs (nucleoside deoxyribosyltransferases) and AT-
Pases;thoseofclade3werelinkedtodistinctDNA-binding
and membrane proteins with 2 transmembrane domains
(TM); those of clade 4 were associated with esterases and
possible RNases; those of clade 7 were associated with

possible RNases carrying a HEPN domain and DNA-
binding proteins; and those of clade 8 with the RT C-
terminus fused to three distinct domains, a Toprim do-
main, a Toll/interleukin-1 receptor/resistance protein do-
main,andapeptidase(trypsin-likeserineprotease)domain.
We also found proteins with similar functions associated
with distantly related RTs (Table1), such as the phospho-
ribosyltransferases (PRTases) found with RTs clustered in
clades2,5,6and9;ortheToprimdomainthatappearedto
be associated with the RTs of clades 1 and 8. In fact only
clade 10 seems to represent a unique RT/putative effector
type and this is also true for the associated ncRNA struc-
ture (type XIII). Comparisons between RT phylogeny, the
distributionofassociatedproteinclustersordomainsfused
to the C-terminus of the RT and the structural diversity
of ncRNA transcripts suggest a modular organization of
retron systems with the (msr-msd)-RT cassette as the key
module acquiring distinct putative effector proteins. This
conclusion may be exemplified by the consensus structure
of the ncRNA and RT phylogeny in the cases of retron sys-
tems I-A and II-A1 in which a similar (msr-msd)-RT cas-
setteacquiredbothATPaseandNDT-likeputativeeffector
domains. The exchange of putative effector modules may
be a consequence of environmental changes to face possi-
blyrapidlyevolvingphages.Theindependenceoftheretron
and associated domain modules is also exemplified by the
presence of stand-alone (msr-msd)-RT cassette in a branch
of the RT clade 2 and clade 11.
Coevolution of various parts of the retron unit
We investigated the evolution of the ncRNA and the RT
relative to the associated protein, by performing coevolu-
tion analyses taking into account the various parts of the
retronunit.WebuiltindependentphylogenetictreesforRT,
associated proteins and the ncRNA, which we compared,
using the 16S rRNA tree for the host genome as a control
(see Materials and Methods). We ensured that the analysis
had sufficient statistical power, by performing these analy-
ses for the types for which it was possible to find complete
retron systems with at least 20 representatives. As exam-
ples of retron systems with distinct functionally predicted
associated proteins within a particular RT clade, we ana-
lyzed types I-A and II-A1, which had a common ncRNA
transcript structure (IA/IIA1), in clade 1, and type I-B2 in
clade 3. As a representative of retron systems with associ-
ated proteins sharing similar functions but linked to dis-
tantlyrelatedRTs,weanalyzedtypeIII-A3inclade9.Type

ditional HNH endonuclease or a Toprim domain (59,60)
thatisfused to theC-terminusofthe retron-encodedRTin
subtype I-C and its three variants (C1, C2 and C3). Type
VII systems carry an associated protein (subtype VII-A2)
or a domain (DUF3800) fused to the RT (subtype VII-
A1) structurally similar to RNaseH2 (61). Type IX sys-
temswere linked to proteins carrying higher eukaryote and

containing an N-terminal ABC ATPase domain fused, in
the last two cases to a Toprim domain. The resulting archi-
tecture resembled that of overcoming lysogenization defect
(OLD) nuclease proteins (59,64,65). Interestingly, the pro-
teins of cluster 221 formed an operon with a downstream
predicted HNH endonuclease (cluster 391), a system rem-
iniscent of the ‘Septu’ antiviral defense system comprising
thePtuABoperon(ATPase,HNHendonuclease)( 66).Phy-
logenetic analysis of the ATPase domain (Figure6A, Sup-
plementary Figure S5 and Supplementary File S2) showed
that protein sequences in cluster 22
1 were grouped with
other reported PtuA homologs, whereas the N-terminal
ATPase domain sequences of clusters 222 and 1591 clus-
tered into two different groups branching off of a com-
mon well-supported node more closely related to the AT-
Pase domain of class 1 and class 2 OLD-nucleases. Finally,
RaptorX identified the OLD nuclease fromThermusscoto-
ductus(PDB 6p74A) as the best template-protein structure
(100% of the residues modeled and aP-value of 2.96e–09)
fortheseproteins.Takentogether,theseresultssuggestthat
the proteins in clusters 22
2 and 1591 are probably new
members of the OLD-protein nuclease family.
The Toprim domain of the protein sequences in clus-
ters 222 and 1591 contained the characteristic aspartate
dyad (DxD) of motif V required for activity in all Toprim-
containing enzymes, and the N-terminal invariant gluta-
mate of motif IV, all preceded by conserved hydrophobic
residues, suggesting that these are catalytically active en-
zymes(SupplementaryFigureS6).TheToprimdomainalso
appearsinthethreevariantsofsubtypeI-C,butfusedatthe
C-terminus of the corresponding RT. The replacement of
thesecondaspartateresidueintheDxDmotifwithagluta-
mate residue (DxE) is a signature specific to the I-C2 vari-
ant. Phylogenetic analyses (Figure6B and Supplementary
FileS3)suggestedthattheToprimdomainsofclusters22
2
(I-B1) and 1591 (I-B2) were more closely related to that of
OLD nucleases, whereas that of subtype I-C arose from a
common ancestor and formed a different, presumably new
lineage within the Toprim superfamily.
Retron system type VII includes an additional domain
(DUF3800) fused at the C-terminus of the RT in the VII-
A1 variant, and an associated protein (cluster 2165) in
the VII-A2 variant, both containing the DUF3800 domain
(Pfam12686).Thisassociatedproteinofunknownfunction
is characterized by a DE motif at the N-terminus, but lack
the conserved Q of the characteristic QxxD motif at the C-
terminus (Supplementary Figure S7). Moreover, these pro-
tein sequences form two well-differentiated clades (Supple-
mentary Figure S8 and Supplementary File S4), suggest-
ing that they may not result from fission/fusion events. In-
terestingly, the modeling of cluster 2165 protein sequences
with RaptorX delivered,as the best template-protein struc-
ture(100%oftheresiduesmodeledanda P-valueof1.39e–
11), pdb: 3pufA and pdb: 1EKE, corresponding to the hu-
manand Methanocaldococcusjannaschii RNaseH2,respec-
tively. However, it should be noted that, in the DUF3800
protein/domain associated with the retron type VII sys-
tem, the second conserved aspartate residue of the four
highly conserved carboxylates (DEDD) forming the ac-
tive site of RNases H is replaced by a glutamate residue
(DEED). The putative functional assignment of these en-
zymes as a type of RNaseH2 therefore requires further
verification.

by protein structure modeling with RaptorX and Phyre2,
which provided, as the best template, pdb:2hsbA (HEPN-

with aP-value of 5.09e–05. The proteins of cluster 1740

lack the conserved H residue of the characteristic HEPN

teinshaveaconservedhistidineresiduelocateddownstream
from the arginine residue modeled as close to the R of the
HEPN motif, as shown in the predicted structure (Figure
7A and B). It is therefore plausible that this residue is an
alternative active-site residue, similar to that present in the
HEPN-T family (62). The presence of a putative HEPN-
domain active site in the proteins of cluster 1740
1 there-
fore suggests that they may provide this retron system with
RNase activity.
Retron system type XIII has a linked gene upstream
or downstream from the RT gene that encodes a cluster

second aspartate residue absent or replaced by glutamate
inclosehomologs(SupplementaryFigureS9).ThisDEDE
motif has been described in some prokaryotic (IS256fam-
ily) mobile elements and in some Mutator transposases
from eukaryotes (70), which suggest that the proteins of
cluster 1141 may be derived from unknown transposases.
Many, but not all, of the associated 1141 proteins in type
XIII systems are preceded by a gene encoding a predicted
HEAT/ARM-like repeat-containing protein a member of
cluster 2161 (the majority), 2162 or 32621 and, in some
cases, by two genes, one encoding a cluster 2591p r o t e i n
and the other encoding a cluster 16881 protein. These
classes of proteins with repeated/H9251-helical motifs have an
extensive solvent-accessible surface and may interact with
proteins and nucleic acids (Supplementary Figure S10).

of the protein such that the C-terminal DNA-binding do-

Phylogenetic analysis of the presumed NDT domain of
these protein sequences (Supplementary Figure S12 and
Supplementary File S5) showed them to be closely related,
but only distantly related to members of the nucleoside 2-
deoxyribosyltransferasefamily(pfam15891).Together,our
data suggest that the cluster 42 proteins may belong to the
NDT family, but the catalytic function of these proteins re-
mains uncertain and will require further experimental vali-
dation.
Retron type III systems are characterized by association
with a predicted PRTase-like protein, which may appear

Insomeclusters(67 2a,67 2band67 3),thisauxiliarypro-
tein appears to be fused to the C-terminus of the puta-
tive PRTase (Table1). Five variants of this type of system
were identified (III-A1 to III-A5), and were supported by
the phylogenetic relationships of distinct PRTase-like clus-
ter sequences (Supplementary Figure S13 and Supplemen-
tary File S6). Thus, the proteins of clusters 67 and 113 may

a three-helix bundle fold, as predicted by trRosetta mod-
els (Supplementary Figure S14). Strikingly, these proteins
had a predicted three-dimensional structure similar to that
of epsilon antitoxin proteins from postsegregational killing
(PSK) systems (71), as shown by a DALI search against
PDB, suggesting a plausible common role for the clusters
in a retron-associated toxin-antitoxin system.
The type X system (Figure5 and Table1) was found
to be associated with a gene encoding a cluster 2273 pro-
tein upstream from the RT, predicted to contain a central
integration host factor (IHF)-like DNA-binding domain
(Pfam00216) and a C-terminal von Hippel-Landau (VHL)
beta domain (Pfam01847) separated by a single TM helix,
with the VHL beta domain on the cytoplasmic side. The
function of VHL beta domains in prokaryotic proteins is
unknown, but, by analogy to the pVHL tumor suppressor
protein, we speculate that the VHL beta domain of clus-
ter 2273 proteins bound to DNA by the IHF-like domain
may recruit other proteins for the formation of nucleopro-
tein complexes associated with the cell membrane.
Finally, there are two retron systems, the type VIII sys-
tem carrying a clade 4 RT and the type XI system car-
rying a clade 8 RT, both lacking recognizable ncRNA
modules, associated with putative proteases, a serine es-
terase (DUF626), and with the C-terminus of the RT
fused to a trypsin-like serine protease. We hypothesize that
these two systems may be involved in cleavage of targeting
peptides.
DISCUSSION
The biological role of retrons has remained a mystery for
almost three decades, despite the identification of these el-
ements as the first type of RT to be discovered in prokary-
otes. Some observations, such as the presence of additional
openreadingframes(ORFs)downstreamfromtheRTgene
or between the msr and msd regions in one third of an-
notated retrons, have raised questions about their impli-
cations for retron biology prompting further speculation
about their possible involvement in the production of un-
usual msDNAs (28). Here, we describe a computational
pipeline for the systematic prediction of genes specifically
associatedwithretronRTsbasedonapreviouslypublished
large dataset of annotated RTs representativeof current di-
versity in prokaryotes. We therefore avoid any bias relating
totheparticularphylogeneticgroupoftheRT,thegenomic
context of the RT gene, the distance to the RT gene or hy-
pothetical possible functions, making it possible to predict
the functional association of genes with retrons with con-
fidence. Using this computational strategy, we found that
the (msr-msd)-RT cassette of retrons could be predicted to
be functionally linked to a single locus encoding putative
nucleases, genes involved in nucleotide metabolism, genes
encodingproteinsbindingDNAorRNA,orproteinsasso-
ciatedwiththecellmembrane .Insomecases,theretronunit
islinkedtoadditionalaccessoryprotein-encodinggenes,or
the RT has additional fused domains. Based on the associ-
atedproteinorRT-fuseddomain,wehaveclassifiedretrons

larlyinmetagenomicanalyses.Ourresultsdemonstratethat
retrons can be broadly considered to be tripartite systems
consistingofthencRNA(msr-msd),theRTandadditional
proteins with diverse enzymatic functions.
We also found a fewretron RT clades/subclades that did
notappeartobeassociatedwithanyspecificproteincluster,
such as the branches found in clades 2 and 11. Clade 2 in-
cludes the RT of the Retron-Eco5 (Ec107) intron, which is
located adjacent to an annotated orotate phosphoribosyl-
transferase. However, only two of the 59 RTs belonging to
this branch are associated with such an additional protein.
This branch has a node in common with a cluster of RTs
linked to PRTase-like proteins. It is therefore plausible that
most of the members of the Retron-Eco5 (Ec107) branch
have lost the associated protein. Interestingly, Retron-Eco5
is the only experimentally studiedE.coli retron not related
to prophages (72). It is, therefore, also conceivable that, in
thisparticularcase,theadjacentphosphoribosyltransferase
isnotfunctionallylinkedtotheretronunit.Moreover,most
of the host genomes harboring the orphan retrons lack ho-
mologsoftheidentifiedretronassociatedproteins.Itthere-
fore remains to be determined whether such retron systems
have evolved to function with currently unknown protein
effectorsintrans, or whether they have acquired a different
mechanistic function.
Interestingly, these tripartite units display extraordinary
modularity, and distantly related RTs and different ncR-
NAs appear to be associated with genes encoding proteins
of similar function. Conversely, particular RTs and ncR-
NAs appear to be linked to functionally different proteins.
Associatedprotein-codinggenesofsimilartypesarepresent
in different clades of the RT phylogeny, indicating a prob-
able exchange of modules between systems. These phylo-
genetic studies reveal a complex evolutionary scenario for
retrons, in which the different modules of the systems have
been exchanged on multiple occasions. For example, types
I-AandII-A1haveanncRNA-RTmoduleincommon,but
have different putative ‘effector’ modules. It seems that, at
a certain point in evolution, type II-A1 retrons acquired
a different effector module from the ‘Septu’ defense sys-
tem (66). The presence of an ncRNA-RT module may add
new features and complexity to the regulatory mechanism
of previous existing systems, as for the RTs embedded in
RT
/CRISPR-Cas systems, which made it possible to ac-
quire spacers from RNA molecules (14,16,19). The diver-
sityofassociatedproteinsandthemodularityofretronsys-
tems are expanding the known functional diversity of the
retron unit and the range of cellular processes underlying
retron activity. A similar cassette organization with diverse
accessory modules has recently been described for DGRs,
linkingRTstofunctionsotherthandiversifyingattachment
proteins (73)

The dynamic gain-loss is frequent for genes present in
mobilegeneticelements(MGEs)anddefensesystems,such
as toxin-antitoxin modules (74). Autonomous mobility has
notbeendemonstratedforretrons,butthereisevidencefor
the horizontal transfer of these units (75) even with inser-
tion into the same genomic site in closely related strains
(76), and retrons seem to be components of rapidly evolv-
ing genomic islands under strong selective pressure, proba-
bly due to the constant threat posed by new bacteria.
Consistent with gain-loss and HGT, we found that the
most retron RTs, albeit more abundant in the phylum Pro-
teobacteria, show a patchy distribution into distinct bacte-
rialphyla.Nevertheless,wealsofoundthatsomeretronsys-
tems like the type XIII have a relevant correlation with the
16SrRNAgeneofthehostgenomeconsistentwiththever-
tical inheritance reported inMyxobacteria(77). Moreover,
two RT clades show a significant restriction in their taxo-
nomicdistribution.Clade2ismostlyfoundinGammapro-
teobacteria and clade 11 is essentially restricted to the phy-
lum Actinobacteria. Thus, some retrons appear to display
a vertical inheritance and may have been domesticated to
perform useful cellular functions other than defense.
Sequence divergent retrons such as Vc95 (Retron-Vch1),
Vc81(Retron-Vch2)andVc137(Retron-Vch3)areinserted
into the same site on chromosome I ofV. cholerae(76).
The first retron is almost exclusively found in pathogenic
serogroups ofV. choleraewhilst the latter two are found
in non-pathogenic serotypes. These observations have led
to speculation that either the retron (msr-msd-RT cassette)
or the additional ORFs of unknown function are determi-
nants of pathogenicity, and that the latter may associate
with retrons to move and exchange between genomes (28).
AccordingtotheRTphylogenyandspecificassociatedpro-
teins,Vc95andVc85belongtothetypeI-AandtypeII-A1
systems,respectively,andtheirRTsarecloselyrelated(clade
1) sharing a ncRNA (IA/IIA1) structure. In our retron
datasetVc137correspondinSupplementaryTableS1toen-
try 1575 (fig|1343738.3.peg.2232) and belongs to the type
II-A3 with a more divergent RT (clade 9). Vc81 and Vc137
areassociatedtoNDT-likeproteinswhereasVc95hasasso-
ciated ATPase and HNH domains. It seems plausible that
these retrons share similar mechanistic functions and in-
sertion mechanism that likely explain their presence in the
same locus, but the distinctive putative effector proteins of
Vc95maybethedeterminantofitspredictedpathogenicity
also depending on the host genome.
The idea that retrons (msr-msd-RT cassette) and associ-
ated proteins function as a unit is also supported by tran-
scriptional analyses showing that the retron and the puta-
tive associated effector protein function as an operon, ex-
pressedunderthecontrolofasinglepromoter( 78).Theex-
actmechanismofretronfunctioningandthepossibleinter-
actionofthe(msr-msd)-RTcassettewiththelinkedprotein
remaintobeelucidated,butwespeculatethattheconserved
ncRNA and RT components form the sensing/recognition
module, and that the additional associated protein acts as
the response module in the retron system, to deal with dif-
ferentcellularstressesandregulatoryprocesses,potentially
includinganti-phagedefense.Retronshavebeenreportedto
beinvolved inbacterial responsestostressconditions,such
as starvation and anaerobic conditions (79,80).
Recently, it was reported that some retrons members
of the type systems I-A (Retron+ATPase+HNH), II-
A3 (Nuc
deoxy+Retron), I-C1 (Retron-Toprim) and XII
(Retron-TIR) defined here mediate antiphage defense and
that the additional proteins or RT-fused domains are also
required for activity (81). Moreover, a recent report (82)
and two pre-prints (83,84) have also suggested that retrons
maybenovelanti-phagedefensesystemsandthattheymay
functionasatoxin /antitoxinsystem.Thefirstoftheseroles
is thought to be mediated by the RT and msDNA, with
the linked effector protein responsible for toxin/antitoxin
functions. Furthermore, according to these reports (81,82),
a large number of retrons, but not all are associated with
defense genes in defense islands. It would be interesting to
know whether there are specific retron systems consistently
unrelated the known and novel candidate defense systems
recently described (81). In summary, our findings further
ourunderstandingofthebiologicalroleofretronsandpro-
vide a basis for future studies on their function and poten-
tial biotechnological applications.
