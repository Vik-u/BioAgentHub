A multifunctional biocatalyst EneIRED capable of catalyzing amine-activated conjugate alkene reduction and 
subsequent reductive amination was discovered. The enzyme realized the coupling of 𝛼, 𝛽-unsaturated carbonyls 
with amines to eﬃciently synthesize a broad set of chiral amine diastereomers based on its unusual active site 
structure and catalytic mechanism. 
Structurally diverse chiral amines are ubiquitous structural motifs 
in biologically active compounds such as natural products and drugs 
[ 1 , 2 ]. The eﬃcient synthesis of chiral amines has received signiﬁ- 
cant interest, as demonstrated by the development of various synthetic 
routes involving diastereoisomeric crystallization, asymmetric reduc- 
tive amination of prochiral ketones, reduction of imines or enimines, 
and C-H amination [3] . Amino compounds typically contain more than 
one stereogenic center, and their asymmetric synthesis with adequate 
(dia)stereoselectivity is challenging and usually requires tedious mul- 
tistep syntheses or intricated cascade catalysis systems [ 4 , 5 ]. Multi- 
enzymatic cascades provide new opportunities for preparing amino 
compounds with multiple stereogenic centers, but their application is 
hampered by issues such as incompatibility in the reaction system, gen- 
eration of byproducts, and complicated work-up [ 6 , 7 ]. Now, Turner and 
collaborators have discovered a multifunctional biocatalyst EneIRED 
from a panel of metagenomic imine reductases (IREDs), which can cat- 
alyze both amine-activated conjugate reduction (CR) of alkenes and fol- 
lowing reductive amination (RA), thus achieving the coupling of 𝛼, 𝛽- 
unsaturated carbonyls with amines for the eﬃcient synthesis of diverse 
chiral amine diastereomers ( Fig. 1 ) [8] . 
IREDs are a family of NADPH-dependent enzymes and are involved 
in the reduction of C = N bonds and reductive amination of C = O bonds 
[9] . Furthermore, in a few cases, IREDs have been shown to catalyze 
the direct reduction of C = O bonds to form corresponding alcohol prod- 
ucts [10] . However, the biocatalytic reduction of C = C bonds was still an 
unexplored area for IREDs, whereas the reaction has typically been per- 
formed with ene-reductases (EREDs) [11] . After screening a total of 389 
IREDs, including both reported and recently developed (meta)genomic 
IREDs [12] with a cyclic ene-imine as the model substrate, 44 enzymes 
were found that could catalyze the asymmetric reduction of both the 
C = C and the C = N bonds of the model substrate. Among them, an IRED,

presumably from Pseudomonas species (EneIRED), displayed excellent 
reactivity for the double reduction CR-RA. 
Under optimized conditions, EneIRED exhibited a broad sub- 
strate proﬁle, enabling CR-RA, mono-CR, or mono-RA of diverse 𝛼, 𝛽- 
unsaturated carbonyls with ammonia or varied amines. Less hindered 
enals and enones as well as amine nucleophiles tend to be converted 
with good chemoselectivity to the corresponding saturated amine prod- 
ucts. For example, coupling of ( E )-2-methyl-2-butenal with cyclopropy- 
lamine aﬀorded > 99% conversion to the saturated amine. Further- 
more, unsubstituted and substituted cycloalkyl-2-enones with diﬀer- 
ent ring sizes were well tolerated by the enzyme, aﬀording good con- 
version and chemo- and stereoselectivity for many of the correspond- 
ing CR–RA products. In particular, C 3 -substitutioned cyclohex-2-enone 
substrates were eﬃciently transformed to CR–RA products even when 
coupled with diﬀerent amine partners ( e.g., NH 3 , methylamine, ally- 
lamine, propargylamine, n -butanamine, pyrrolidine, and ( R )- or ( S )-3- 
ﬂuoropyrrolidine), yielding high conversion and chemo-, enantio- and 
diastereoselectivity in many cases. The enzymatic CR-RA also demon- 
strated great synthetic applicability, with 60–81% isolated yield for the 
preparative synthesis of the saturated amine products. In one case, 64% 
isolated yield was attained at a scale of 1.0 mmol. 
The unusual function of EneIRED inspired the researchers to con- 
duct mechanistic investigations into the enzymatic catalysis. Isotopic 
labelling experiments using regenerated deuterated nicotinamide cofac- 
tor to transform 3-methyl-2-cyclohexenone with cyclopropylamine as an 
amine partner showed that hydride transfer occurs at the C-1 and C-3 po- 
sitions of the carbonyl substrate. A reaction time-course study and sev- 
eral control experiments suggested that the enone substrate ﬁrst under- 
goes CR to the corresponding ketone before transformation into the sat- 
urated amine via RA, and an ene-imine-NAD(P)H-biocatalyst complex 
could be essential for EneIRED-catalyzed CR. The researchers further

resolved the structure of EneIRED to obtain structural insights into the 
catalytic mechanism. Consequently, structural features were observed 
in the active site compared to the other IREDs with released structures 
in the database, and residues Y177 and Y181 proved to play signiﬁcant 
roles in the CR-RA. Molecular docking of the enzyme with the result- 
ing ene-imine intermediate suggests that the prochiral carbon atom of 
the C = C bond is positioned at a suitable distance to transfer the hy- 
dride from the pyridinium ring of the cofactor. Based on mechanistic and 
structural studies, an EneIRED catalytic cycle of CR-RA was delineated 
by the researchers ( Fig. 1 ). First, the nicotinamide cofactor NAD(P)H 
and the formed ene-imine intermediate from 𝛼, 𝛽-unsaturated carbonyl 
and amine partner are accepted in the active site of EneIRED, generat- 
ing an ene-imine-NAD(P)H-enzyme complex. The hydride is then trans- 
ferred from nicotinamide cofactor to the C-3 of the ene-imine due to its 
beneﬁcial orientation, whereby CR occurs and generates the stereoen- 
riched 1-enamine-NAD(P) + -EneIRED complex. The prochiral 1-enamine 
and NAD(P) + are then released from the active site, and the former un- 
dergoes hydrolysis to the stereoenriched carbonyl. Subsequently, the in- 
termediate imine is formed from the stereoenriched carbonyl and the 
amine partner and complexed with the enzyme and nicotinamide cofac- 
tor NAD(P)H, which is transformed into the ﬁnal stereoenriched amine 
product via IRED-catalyzed RA. 
The identiﬁcation of new enzymes and new activities of previously 
discovered enzymes plays a signiﬁcant role in extending the synthetic 
scope of biocatalysis and pushing forward its application in the manu- 
facture of high-value chiral compounds [ 13 , 14 ]. Although the catalysis 
of IREDs, especially in the synthesis of chiral amines, has been widely 
investigated in the last decade [ 9 , 15–17 ], the identiﬁcation of the mul- 
tifunctional biocatalyst EneIRED provides new perspectives in the bio- 
catalytic area due to this newly disclosed function for C = C reduction 
[8] . The CR-RA catalysis enabled by EneIRED in a one-pot, one-catalyst 
fashion provides a concise, green, and eﬃcient route to stereoenriched 
amine products with multiple stereogenic centers. This is a signiﬁcant 
discovery that improves upon previously developed methods, consid- 
ering the existing issues associated with cost, operational complexity, 
environmental impact, and product quality [4–7] . 
The catalytic mechanism and chemoselectivity to imine reduction, 
reductive amination, and ketoreduction have been widely studied for 
IREDs with structural insights [ 15 , 17 , 18 ]. Nevertheless, the identiﬁca- 
tion of the new CR-RA function of IREDs with structural investigations 
2

sheds new light on understanding of the structure-activity relationships 
of the family of IREDs, which provides guidance for the laboratory evo- 
lution of the enzymes to enable the synthesis of structurally diﬀerent 
chiral amines of interest. The study will likely inspire further exploration 
or creation of new enzyme activities for other NAD(P)H-dependent en- 
zyme families ( e.g., amine dehydrogenases [ 19 , 20 ]) based on structural 
study and by virtue of advances in protein engineering [21] .
