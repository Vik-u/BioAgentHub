Fast screening of enzyme variants is crucial for tailoring biocatalysts for the
asymmetric synthesis of non-natural chiral chemicals, such as amines. How-
ever, most existing screening methods either are limited by the throughput or
require specialized equipment. Herein, we report a simple, high-throughput,
low-equipment dependent, and generally applicable growth selection system
for engineering amine-forming or converting enzymes and apply it to improve
biocatalysts belonging to three different enzyme classes. This results in (i) an
amine transaminase variant with 110-fold increased speciﬁc activity for the
asymmetric synthesis of the chiral amine intermediate of Linagliptin; (ii) a 270-
fold improved monoamine oxidase to prepare the chiral amine intermediate of
Cinacalcet by deracemization; and (iii) an ammonia lyase variant with a 26-fold
increased activity in the asymmetric synthesis of a non-natural amino acid. Our
growth selection system is adaptable to different enzyme classes, varying
levels of enzyme activities, and thus aﬂexible tool for various stages of an
engineering campaign.
Chiral amines are indispensable building blocks for a large variety of
bioactive pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals, and they are also widely
employed as chiral auxiliaries and resolving agents. Consequently,
catalytic synthesis of optically pure amines has been the key subject in
chemical and pharmaceutical industries
1–4. In this context, biocatalytic
approaches are very attractive for highly selective and green synthesis
of chiral chemicals
5–10. Recent discoveries and developments of
transaminases11–15, monoamine oxidases16,a m i n ed e h y d r o g e n a s e s17,
imine reductases18, and ammonia lyases19 provide a versatile biocata-
lyst toolbox to access chiral amines. Since many synthetically useful
chiral intermediates are new to these natural enzymes, extensive and
time-consuming directed evolution
20–23 is usually required to tailor
natural enzymes for the production of speciﬁc non-natural chiral
amine targets24–26. Therefore, high-throughput screening methods
have been developed for speciﬁcc l a s s e so fe n z y m e s27,28. For example,
specialized amine donors that elicit optical responses were exploited
for assaying transaminases29; monoamine oxidase activities are visua-
lized with H 2O2-coupled assays30; and NAD(P) +/NAD(P)H-coupled
assays facilitate screening of dehydrogenases/reductases variants31.
For challenging lyase-catalyzed reactions without easily detectable co-
products, mutant design mostly had to rely on computational
redesign
32,33 or expensive high-throughput mass spectrometry 34.
However, most of these methods either are still limited by the
throughput (when applied in multi-well plates) or require specialized

and expensive equipment (e.g., robotic platforms35 or microﬂuidic
devices30,36), thus preventing a more widespread implementation of
these enzymes in biocatalysis. Furthermore, none of these methods is
applicable for different classes of enzymes. Therefore, a high-
throughput, low-equipment dependent, and generally applicable
concept is highly desired for the directed evolution of enzymes for the
synthesis of non-natural chiral amines.
In contrast to screening with the methods mentioned above,
growth selection is intrinsically connected with high-throughput and
simplicity because only the desired highly active variants (instead of
every variant) of the library are detectable and generate cell growth as
an easily measurable output signal via the optical density (OD) in liquid
culture or colony formation/size in solid culture
37–39. However, selec-
tion requires a direct link between the activity of the enzyme and the
survival of the host, which is often highly specialized and difﬁcult to be
established for many synthetically useful enzymes. Pioneering studies
in selection-based enzyme evolution often focused on enzymes con-
ferring antibiotic resistance (e.g.,β-lactamases)
40,41 targeting proteins
linked to the expression of antibiotic resistance genes42 or phage coat
protein pIII (essential for phage propagation)43.Y e t ,i ti sd i fﬁcult to
apply this concept to synthetically useful enzymes. Another approach
is to exploit the auxotrophy generated by deleting essential genes for
certain metabolites (e.g., natural amino acids)
44–46 and then to com-
plement them by directed evolution of related enzymes, which are
usually limited to those cases where natural metabolites or biochem-
icals are produced as exempliﬁed for a chorismate mutase
45 or natural
amino acid racemases46. Very recently, redox cofactor (NAD(P)+/
NAD(P)H) auxotrophs were developed via extensive genome engi-
neering, and employed for the selection-based evolution of several
NAD(P)H-dependent enzymes
47–50. This approach has proven useful in
switching the cofactor preference of several enzymes (e.g., formate
dehydrogenase)
47,48, yet with limited success in improving activities
(~10-fold) for non-native substrates49,50. Despite the fact that growth
selection is theoretically a very powerful strategy, its great potential of
evolving enzymes for asymmetric synthesis/kinetic resolution is
underrepresented, except for early reports on the selection-based
evolution of hydrolases
51,52. There is rare report of a selection-based
improvement of enzyme activities for the synthesis of non-natural
chiral amines.
Herein, we report a simple, high-throughput, low-equipment
dependent, and generally applicable growth selection system for the
directed evolution of amine-forming or converting enzymes (Fig.1).
This methodology is demonstrated by the evolution of three different
classes of enzymes for the synthesis of three important non-natural
chiral amines in high enantiopurity: (1) an amine transaminase (TA,
enzyme class EC 2) for (R)-1-Boc-3-aminopiperidine, the key chiral
intermediate for the antidiabetic drugs Linagliptin, Trelagliptin and
Alogliptin; (2) a monoamine oxidase (MAO, enzyme class EC 1) for (R)-
1-(1-naphthyl)ethylamine, the key intermediate for the calcimimetic
drug Cinacalcet; and (3) an ammonia lyase (enzyme class EC 4) for (S)-
2-amino-3-(naphthalen-1-yl)propanoic acid, the key chiral synthon for a
highly potent and long-acting Gα12 agonist. The rapid improvements
of catalytic activities (26−270-fold) in only one or two rounds of evo-
lution without specialized equipment showcase the great potential of a
growth selection system for wider application for the creation of sui-
table biocatalysts to meet the speed requirement in industry.
Results
Design and general procedure of the growth selection system
To design a generally applicable growth selection system for amine-
forming or converting enzymes, we exploited growth based on alanine
or ammonia formation generated from the targeted amine by amine-
forming or converting enzymes: reversible transamination of the tar-
geted amine by a TA with intracellular pyruvate releasesʟ-o r
D-alanine
(Fig. 1a); oxidation of the targeted amine by the MAO produces the
imine, which is auto-hydrolyzed to release ammonia (Fig.1b); the
reversible conversion of the targeted amino acid by the lyase produces
an α,β-unsaturated acid and ammonia (Fig.1c). Alanine (
L-o r D-) or
ammonia can then be easily utilized by theEscherichia colistrain as the
nitrogen source for cell growth (Fig.1d). Hence, when the targeted
amine is supplied as the only nitrogen source in a chemically-deﬁned
medium, only the cells containing active enzyme variants (producing
alanine or ammonia) can survive and grow. The precondition is that
the host cannot directly utilize the targeted amines. Fortunately, this is
often valid for many synthetically useful non-natural amines, because
E. coliBL21(DE3) has a rather limited scope of nitrogen sources (Sup-
plementary Fig. 1) and its endogenous transaminases are mainly acting
on amino acids. Indeed, the use of non-natural amines as the only
nitrogen source was often applied to isolate wild-type microorganisms
containing amine-converting enzymes. However, this strategy has
rarely been demonstrated for the directed evolution of enzymes for
the synthesis of non-natural chiral amines.
The general procedure of the growth-based directed evolution
system to improve amine-forming or converting enzymes is proposed
as follows (Fig.2): (1) genetic construction of a vector harboring the
gene encoding the enzyme of interest with a suitable promoter, and
mutagenesis by PCR (e.g., multiple site-directed mutagenesis, error-
prone PCR or DNA shufﬂing, Fig.2a); (2) highly efﬁcient transformation
of E. coliwith the constructed gene library by electroporation (Fig.2b);
(3) selection of improved variants within theE. colilibrary on the M9
plate or liquid medium (enrichment followed by spreading on LB agar
plates) with the targeted amine as the only nitrogen source (Fig.2c); (4)
isolation of the single colonies, sequencing of the genes, puriﬁcation,
and characterization of the enzyme variants (Fig.2d). By this, a
genotype-phenotype linkage is ensured. A common issue in the
growth selection is that the cell growth rate may not be proportional to

TA catalyzes the reversible transamination of a targeted amine and releases easily
usable ʟ-o rD-alanine (highlighted).b The MAO catalyzes oxidation of a targeted
amine to its imine which is auto-hydrolyzed to release ammonia (highlighted).
c The lyase catalyzes the reversible conversion of anα,β-unsaturated acid and
ammonia (highlighted) to a targeted amino acid.d Alanine or ammonia generated
from a targeted amine by the active enzymes is then utilized in situ for cell growth
serving as an output signal.

the speciﬁc activity of the enzyme due to the complexity of the cell
growth. To address this, we employed four constitutive promoters
with different strengths (Supplementary Fig. 2) on the vectors to
modulate the expression levels of the enzyme toﬁne-tune the selec-
tion pressure. A strong promoter resulting in high expression will
facilitate the conversion of sufﬁcient amounts of amine to promote
growth when the starting activity is low. A medium or low expression,
on the contrary, ensures growth of cells bearing only the most active
variants if a moderate or decent template activity already exists. Other
strategies, such as inducible promoter, 5′-untranslated region

expression levels of the enzyme.
Growth selection-based evolution of an amine transaminase
To demonstrate the functionality and advantages of the growth
selection system for the evolution of TAs, we selected the (R)-selective
AtTA fromAspergillus terreusfor the synthesis of (R)-1, the key chiral
synthon for Linagliptin
53, Trelagliptin, and Alogliptin (Fig. 3a)54.

Although the synthesis of (R)-1 with a commercial TA was reported
recently55, the sequence of that enzyme is unknown. We previously
discovered that AtTA(wt) could be applied for the synthesis of (R)-156,
however, the conversion was only 11%. We found the speciﬁc activity of
AtTA(wt) towards (R)-1 is only 0.038 U/mg, which is almost two orders
of magnitude lower than for the benchmark substrate (R)-1-pheny-
l e t h y l a m i n e( 2 . 9U / m g ) .T h ee fﬁcient synthesis of (R)-1 by AtTA is thus
not possible unless protein engineering signiﬁcantly improves the
speciﬁc activity. To verify the feasibility of growth selection, we cloned
the AtTA(wt) gene under the control of four promoters with different
strengths, and assayed the growth of the resulting transformedE. coli
cells on M9 agar plates with
D-alanine (positive control), (R)-1-pheny-
lethylamine (positive control), and (R)-1 as the only nitrogen source
(Supplementary Fig. 3).
The results show that (1) allE. colicould easily useD-alanine for
growth; (2) expression of AtTA(wt) at strong to weak levels enabled
E. colito grow on (R)-1-phenylethylamine, whileE. coliwas unable to
grow with very weak expression of AtTA(wt) or without it (empty
vector); (3) allE. colicells were unable to grow on (R)-1. Therefore, if
the activity of AtTA towards (R)-1 is remarkably improved, theE. coli
cell containing this variant should stand out by forming a colony on
the plate (Fig.3b).
To maximize the chance of success in the directed evolution
rounds, weﬁrst analyzed the structure of AtTA(wt) (PDB:4CE5)
57 and
selected 13 residues in the active site region (Fig.3c). These residues
were grouped intoﬁve clusters for the ease of simultaneous muta-
genesis: H55-Y60-V62, F115-E117, V147-V149, L182-W184-L187, and
T274-T275-A276. Saturation mutagenesis of each group was per-
formed with two or three NNK codons, thus leading to two libraries of
1024 and three libraries of 32,768 unique combinations. The AtTA
libraries were constructed using the vectors bearing a strong or
medium promoter. These were introduced intoE. coliBL21(DE3) cells
by electroporation, and selected on M9 agar plates with (R)-1 as the
sole nitrogen source. Many colonies appeared on allﬁve plates of AtTA
libraries with a strong promoter (Supplementary Fig. 4), indicating that
already a slight improvement of activity or expression may allowE. coli
to grow. On the other hand, medium expressed AtTA allows a more
stringent selection: only around 20 colonies were found in the F115-
E117 library (Supplementary Fig. 5). The plasmids of 12 representative
colonies were isolated to yield eight unique variants, which turned out
to have much higher speciﬁc activity than the wild-type (0.11–0.53 vs
0.038 U/mg, Supplementary Fig. 6). The best three variants
(0.40–0.53 U/mg) were chosen as templates for further mutagenesis.
To increase andﬁne-tune the selection pressure, they were subcloned
to the vectors with a weak or very weak promoter. Growth experiments
conﬁrmed (Supplementary Fig. 7) that the very weak promoter yields
the best condition for the three AtTA variants for further selection and
thus we started the second round of evolution by introducing satura-
tion mutagenesis at the other four residue groups. Only the AtTA(YHC)
with D5Y/F115H/E117C mutations gave some colonies for all four
groups (Supplementary Fig. 8). A total of 96 colonies were sequenced
and led to 15 different variants, which were evaluated to yield two
signiﬁcantly more active variants (additional H55R and V147F/V149Y,
1.7–1.9 U/mg, Supplementary Fig. 9). We further combined the bene-
ﬁcial mutants and removed the accidentally introduced D5Y mutation
from theﬁrst round of evolution. The resulting variants were evaluated
(Fig. 3d) and AtTA(RHC) with H55R/F115H/E117C gave the highest
activity of 4.2 U/mg (110-fold over the wild type) while maintaining very
high enantioselectivity. The best AtTA variants were applied for the
asymmetric synthesis of (R)-1 (Fig.3e): AtTA(RHC) produced (R)-1 (98%
ee) in quantitative conversion in 5 h, while AtTA(wt) only gave (R)-1
with 8.7% conversion under the same conditions. The preparative scale
synthesis was performed with puriﬁed AtTA(RHC) to obtain (R)-1 (98%
ee) in 98% isolated yield (Supplementary Fig. 10). AtTA(RHC) is one of
the best TAs for the synthesis of (R)-1.
To elucidate the possible molecular basis of the improved activity
(considering the changes in charge, polarity, and size present in the
triple mutant H55R/F115H/E117C), we solved the crystal structure of
AtTA(RHC) (Supplementary Fig. 11, Supplementary Table 1) with
bound PLP (7XG5) and with bound LLP (PLP-Lys180,7XG6)a n dp e r -
formed a docking experiment with the reaction intermediate, the PLP-
(R)-1 complex (the external aldimine). As depicted in Fig.3fa n dS u p -
plementary Fig. 12, the PLP part binds to AtTA(RHC) in a very similar
position to PLP in the AtTA(wt), and the (R)-
1 part ﬁts into the active
site of AtTA(RHC) very well. According to the docking results, parti-
cularly the F115H mutation precisely carves out additional space in the
substrate-binding pocket to accommodate the piperidine ring of (R)-1.
E117C expands the pocket and may facilitate the binding of thetert-
butyl group of (R)-1. Furthermore, the H55R variation offers a posi-
tively charged side chain which provides a hydrogen bond (2.9 Å)
between the guanidinium group and the carbonyl group of (R)-1.
Therefore, only three precise mutations have been sufﬁcient to sig-
niﬁcantly (>100-fold) improve the activity of AtTA towards (R)-1,
enabling practical asymmetric synthesis of this key chiral amine
intermediate of several drugs.
Growth selection-based evolution of a monoamine oxidase
To prove the applicability of growth selection for MAOs, we selected
the cyclohexylamine oxidase (CHAO) fromBrevibacterium oxydansfor
the deracemization of3 via simultaneous biocatalytic oxidation and
chemical reduction to produce (R)-3, the key chiral amine intermediate
for the calcimimetic drug Cinacalcet (Fig.4a)
58.A l t h o u g h(R)-3 was
prepared by biocatalysis before (mainly via TAs)59, there are no reports
dealing with a biocatalytic deracemization. The speciﬁc activities of
CHAO(wt) towards (S)- and (R)-3 were 0.009 and <0.001 U/mg,
respectively (Fig.4d). This indicated that the CHAO(wt) has the desired
selectivity towards3,b u tt h es p e c iﬁc activity towards (S)-3 is too low
for synthetic applications. To degrade the highly toxic H2O2 generated
by CHAO, catalase was co-expressed with CHAO during the selection.
Co-expressing of CHAO(wt) at different levels and catalase enabledE.
coli to grow in M9 liquid culture with ammonia, cyclohexylamine
(activity of 5.6 U/mg)
60, or cyclopentylamine (activity of 0.33 U/mg)60
as the only nitrogen source (Supplementary Fig. 13). Overexpression of
the catalase is necessary for growth on substrates, such as cyclohex-
ylamine, which are converted with high activity (Supplementary
Fig. 14). However, (S)-3 and the corresponding ketone are toxic toE.
coli cells (Supplementary Fig. 15). At a lowered concentration (1 mM) of
(S)-3, no toxicity effects were observed, but colony formation on agar
plate was difﬁcult to evaluate. Therefore, we performed enrichment of
E. colicells in liquid cultures and added methyl laurate as a growth-
compatible second phase which acts as a reservoir of (S)-3 and also
extracts the ketone in situ. At this reduced concentration of (S)-3 in the
medium,E. colicells bearing active variants of CHAO could be enriched
a n di s o l a t e d( F i g .4b).
To accelerate the developing timelines
61, we envisioned that the
growth selection could allow dramatic improvements of activity via a
single round of evolution. CHAO(wt) showed a high activity of 3.5 U/mg
towards (S)-1-phenylethylamine
60, a similar but less bulky aromatic
amine. Thus, it was docked into the active site of CHAO(wt) (PDB:4I59)62
to identify possible key residues for mutagenesis (Fig.4c). We specu-
lated that (S)-3 may bind in a similar pose but the additional ring of (S)-3
may occupy either side (F88-F351-L353-F368 or T198-L199-M226-Y321
labeled in salmon or green, Fig.4c). These two groups of hot spots were
subjected to simultaneous mutagenesis using the DBS codon, which
stands for 18 different codons encoding 12 hydrophobic and small

site mutagenesis of CHAO(wt) wasperformed with the GoldenGate
method63, leading to two libraries of 104,976 unique combinations.
These libraries were constructed using the plasmids with medium to
very weak promoters, transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells

(expressing the catalase) by electroporation, and then underwent
enrichment in M9 medium with (S)-3 i nt h ep r e s e n c eo fm e t h y ll a u r a t e .
The culture was diluted every 24 h 5 times, and signiﬁcant growth was
only observed for the medium expressed library of T198-L199-M226-
Y321 (Supplementary Fig. 16). The resulting enriched culture was
spread on an LB plate, and 12 colonies were isolated to yield two
unique variants, CHAO(MALM) with T198M/L199A/M226L/Y321M and
CHAO(MVLM) with T198M/L199V/M226L/Y321M mutations. The spe-
ciﬁc activities of the puriﬁed CHAO(MALM) and CHAO(MVLM) towards
(S)-3 were 0.64 and 2.54 U/mg, respectively (Fig.4d). This demonstrated
a7 0–270-fold increase in speciﬁc activities, while the high enantios-
electivity was preserved (≤0.001 U/mg towards (R)-3 for both variants).
The enzyme kinetics of CHAO(MVLM) towards (S)-3 werek
cat =2 4 0m i n
−1, Km =2 . 2m M ,Ki = 8.4 mM (Supplementary Fig. 17). In comparison with
CHAO(wt) (kcat =0 . 9 1m i n−1, Km =4 . 5m M ,Ki =2 5m M ) , t h e q u a d r u p l e
mutant mainly improved thekcat, reduced theKm but also exhibited low
substrate inhibition.E. colicells co-expressing CHAO(MVLM) and cata-
lase were employed for the deracemization ofrac-3,l e a d i n gt oe n a n -

E. colicells expressing CHAO(wt) gave almost racemic3 (4% ee)( F i g .4e,
Supplementary Fig. 18). The preparative scale synthesis was also per-
formed to obtain (R)-3 (>99% ee) in 69% isolated yield (Supplementary
Fig. 19). As far as we known, CHAO(MVLM) is the best enzyme for the
production of (R)-3 by deracemization.
Next, (S)-3 was docked to a homology model of CHAO(MVLM) to
elucidate the possible rationale for the observed improved activity
(Fig. 4f). According to the docking results, (S)-3 binds to the active site
of CHAO(MVLM) in a similar pose but at a slightly different angle
compared to (S)-1-phenylethylamine in the CHAO(wt). The Y321M
mutation slightly increases the hydrophobicity and size of the pocket.
T198M also slightly expands the space by pointing the methionine side
chain away from the active site. L199V may provide a suitable hydro-
phobic interaction with the naphthalene ring. Besides the changes in
the active site, the M226L mutationﬂips the side chain away from F351
and opens the active site to the substrate channel. With proper
structure-guided selection of mutation residues, a single round of
e v o l u t i o nw i t hg r o w t hs e l e c t i o nw a ss u fﬁcient to signiﬁcantly (>200-
fold) improve the activity of CHAO towards (S)-3.
Growth selection-based evolution of an ammonia lyase
To further demonstrate the applicability of the growth selection sys-
tem, we have chosen the phenylalanine ammonia lyase fromPetrose-
linum crispum (PcPAL)19 for the synthesis of the non-natural amino
acid, (S)-5, the key chiral intermediate for a highly potent Gα12 agonist
(Fig. 5a)64.T h es p e c iﬁc activities of PcPAL(wt) towardsʟ-phenylalanine
and the target (S)-5 were 0.147 and 0.0027 U/mg, respectively (Fig.5d),
suggesting a large room for activity improvement. However, the
solubility of (S)-5 in the culture medium is very low (i.e., <1.5 mM).
Furthermore, the growth selection using amino acids is complicated
by the presence of indigenous enzymes in the host (e.g., amino acid
transaminases). Thus, we tailored theE. coli host by expressing the
aromatic amino acid transporter (AroP, to increase the availability of
(S)-5) and deleting the gene encoding the aromatic amino acid trans-
aminase (tyrB, to minimize the interference of indigenous enzymes).
We tested the E. coli host (with or without deletingtyrB)f o rt h e
expression of PcPAL(wt) at different levels (with or without co-
expressing AroP) on M9 agar plates supplemented with ammonia,
ʟ-Phe, or (S)-5 as the only nitrogen sources (Supplementary Fig. 20). As
expected, deletingtyrB signiﬁcantly reduced the background growth
on ʟ-Phe, while expressing AroP contributed to the fast utilization of
ʟ-Phe. With these two modiﬁcations, there was a better correlation
between growth and promoter strength. Although no obvious cell

growth on (S)-5 was observed, deletingtyrB and co-expressing AroP
may help to identify PcPAL variants with improved activity on (S)-5.
Thus, the selection was performed using this engineeredE. colihost in
liquid cultures with 1 mM of (S)-5 (Fig. 5b).
Taking advantage of previous studies of PcPAL19,w ea i m e dt o
improve its activity via a single round of evolution. Guided by the
structure of PcPAL(wt) with the inhibitor (R)-(1-amino-2-phenylethyl)
phosphonic acid (PDB:6HQF)
65, six hydrophobic residues lining the
phenyl ring (L134, F137, L138, L256, V259, I460) were selected for
simultaneous multi-site mutagenesis (Fig.5c). Instead of using NNK or
DBS codons, we only focused on small hydrophobic side chains: the
DYA codon (encodes L, I, V, T, S, and A) was used for positions L134,
L138, and L256; the DYC codon (encodes F, I, V, T, S, and A) was used
for F137; the RYC codon (encodes I, V, T, and A) was used for V259 and
I460. Six-site directed mutageneses of PcPAL(wt) were achieved with
sequentially performed Q5 mutagenesis rounds, leading to a library of
20,736 unique combinations. The libraries were constructed using the
plasmids with strong to weak promoters, then introduced intoE. coli
BL21(DE3)ΔtyrB cells (expressing the transporter AroP) and subjected
to enrichment in M9 medium supplemented with (S)-5. The culture
was diluted every 24 h 5 times, and signiﬁcant growth was only
observed for the library with strong expression level (Supplementary
Fig. 21). The resulting enriched culture was spread on a LB agar plate
and 24 colonies were isolated to yield four unique variants: PcPAL(AI)
with L134A/L256I, PcPAL(AV) with L134A/F137V, PcPAL(AVI) with
L134A/F137V/L256I, and PcPAL(AVV) with L134A/F137V/I460V. These
variants showed speciﬁc activities of 0.034–0.071 U/mg for converting
(S)-5 and speciﬁc activities of 0.36–0.55 U/mg for converting 6
(Fig.5d). These activities are 13–26 times higher than that of PcPAL(wt).
E. coli whole cells expressing PcPAL variants were evaluated for the
asymmetric synthesis of (S)-5 (Supplementary Fig. 22). The best
PcPAL(AI) afforded enantiopure (S)-5 i n8 2 %c o n v e r s i o ni n1h ,w h e r e a s
the wild-type PcPAL only gave (S)-5 in 3% conversion under the same
conditions (Fig.5e, Supplementary Fig. 23).
To provide molecular insights for the improved activity, com-
pound 6 was docked to the homology model of PcPAL(AI) (Fig.5f).
Clearly,6 binds to the active site of PcPAL(AI) in the same pose as the
inhibitor in the PcPAL(wt) (Fig.5c) as shown from our docking models.
The L134A mutation (most important, reﬂected in all variants) clearly
caves out additional space in the pocket to accommodate the naphthyl
group. The L256I mutation (found in the two most active variants)
slightly and precisely enlarges the pocket to accommodate6.A n o t h e r
important mutation, F137V, also provides more space but in a direction
that may not directly contact6.W i t ht h e s em o d iﬁcations, the speciﬁc
activity of PcPAL towards6 increased 26-fold to 0.55 U/mg, enabling
the biocatalytic synthesis of the key chiral non-natural amino acid,
though further engineering of PcPAL may be required for practical
applications.
Discussion
Fast identiﬁcation of active enzyme mutants is crucial for the directed
evolution of biocatalysts for the efﬁcient synthesis of chemicals.
Instead of the widely adopted high-throughput screening methods,
herein, we developed a facile growth selection system– ﬁne-tuned by a
set of suitable promoters– generally applicable for different classes of
amine-forming or converting enzymes. The principle of the metho-
dology is based on the targeted chiral amine as the sole nitrogen
source for E. coli cell growth in a chemically-deﬁned medium. Our
selection method is fast and efﬁcient: for carrying out the protocol on
agar plates, one week is sufﬁcient to proceed from a cloned library to
identiﬁed and sequenced hits. Two weeks are necessary if the selection
is done via growth enrichment in liquid medium. A clear advantage of

this approach is that an organic phase can be used as a substrate/
product reservoir if a hydrophobic substrate (or product) has to be
used that shows a low solubility or toxicity at a higher concentration.
The largest library in this study included 10
5 clones for the selection
of a MAO variant, keeping in mind an electroporation efﬁciency
(= throughput) of 105−106 in our study (Supplementary Fig. 24). The
upper limit is only given by the transformation efﬁciency and might be
increased to 106−107 variants. This makes this strategy especially
appealing for simultaneous site-saturated mutation of multiple posi-
tions to harness potentially synergistic effects and thus to identify
variants with a signiﬁcant improvement in one round of evolution. A
potentially higher activity gain on the other hand also facilitates a clear
growth advantage and the reduction of false-positive hits.
In comparison with previously developed screening methods
using low/medium-throughput analytic instruments or high-
throughput microﬂuidic devices, our growth selection method pre-
sented here can interrogate very large enzyme libraries by cir-
cumventing the analysis of every variant. Furthermore, the method
works also without expensive and specialized instruments/devices.
This is particularly useful for laboratories with limited access to these
instruments/devices, such as small companies or labs in developing
countries. In comparison with traditional screening in microtiter
plates, the growth selection system is free from tedious work and
substantially reduces the use of expensive consumables (such as by
using MTP assays and/or robotic platforms). Considering that many
laboratory consumables are plastics, the growth selection method
furthermore has a minimized environmental footprint. Another
advantage of the growth selection method is its general applicability:
these growth selection procedures could be easily transferable to
evolve other classes of amine-converting enzymes. The use ofﬁne-
tuned promoters and expression systems enables applying this growth
selection concept to other enzyme classes and growth-facilitating
metabolites produced. This general applicability also reduces the
barriers for researchers to adopt this method.
In conclusion, our growth selection system was demonstrated to
enable signiﬁcant improvement of catalytic activities (26–270-fold) as
shown for an amine transaminase, a monoamine oxidase, and a lyase in
only one or two rounds of evolution without expensive and specialized
equipment. We are convinced that the concept and method described
herein are generally applicable to improve other enzymes (e.g., amine
dehydrogenases, imine reductases) for the synthesis of non-natural
chiral amines, amino acids, amides, and other nitrogen-containing
molecules. Considering its attractive features of simplicity, high-
throughput, environmentally friendliness and low-equipment depen-
dency, we envision that the growth selection system can be widely
adopted in academia and industry to develop biocatalysts suitable for
various applications.
Methods
Growth selection of AtTA libraries for converting (R)-1
The AtTA libraries with strong and medium constitutive promoters
were transformed into electrocompetent cells ofE. coliBL21 (DE3)
by using an electroporation cuvette (1 mm gap) and defaultE. coli
settings (1.8 kV) for the MicroPulser Electroporator (Biorad).
Immediately after the electroporation shock, prewarmed LB med-
ium (2 ml, 37 °C) was added to the cuvette and the cells were
cultured in an incubator for 2 h at 30 °C, 200 rpm. Then, a small
portion of the cells (20μl) was isolated to test the electroporation
efﬁciency. Half of the cells were added into LB medium (5 ml) con-
taining kanamycin (50 mg l
−1) for isolation of the plasmids from the
libraries. The other half of the cells were centrifuged (5 min,
4000 ×g), and the supernatant of the LB medium was removed. The
cell pellets were resuspended in M9 medium (300 μl) without
nitrogen source, and then spread on the agar plates of M9 medium
containing kanamycin (25 mg l
−1) and (R)-1 (10 mM) as the sole
nitrogen source. The plates were kept in an incubator (30 °C) for
5 days. Photos of the plates were taken every 24 h. Colonies were
usually observed on the 2nd or 3rd day, if there are positive hits.
Some big and representative colonies were picked and transferred
into LB liquid medium (5 ml) containing kanamycin (50 mg l
−1)f o r
preparation of cell stocks and plasmids for sequencing. The growth
selection for the second round of evolution of AtTA was performed
following the same procedures above.
Asymmetric synthesis of (R)-1 by puriﬁed AtTA variants
The reaction was run in a vessel ﬁtted with a magnetic stirrer,
temperature probe, pH probe, and base addition. To a 100-mlﬂask,
the following components were added to form a 40-ml system:
CHES buffer (100 mM, pH 8.5) including PLP (1 mM),
D-alanine
(500 mM), oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD +,
2–3 mM), glucose dehydrogenase (3 U ml−1), D-glucose (550 mM)
and lactate dehydrogenase (6 U ml−1); 8 ml stock solution of2
(1250 mM in DMSO); puriﬁed protein (1–2m gm l−1). The addition of
the respective ketone started the reaction and the reactor was then
stirred at 30 °C and with the pH maintained between 8.4–8.6 for 12 h
by automatic addition of NaOH solution (2 M). To monitor the
progression of the reaction, samples (50μl) were taken at different
times of the reaction (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 5, and 12 h), and mixed with
acetonitrile (500 μl) and hydrochloric acid solution (100 mM,
450 μl) for HPLC analysis to determine the conversion of2 (cali-
bration curves, see Supplementary Fig. 25). Afterwards, the reaction
was quenched with HCl to pH 2.0. The products were extracted with
ethyl acetate (EtOAc) at pH 10 (NaOH addition), delivering (after
drying and evaporation) the crude amines as oils. These were
characterized (HPLC and achiral GC). Theee values of (R)-1 were
analyzed by chiral GC analysis. After extraction of (R)-1 with EtOAc,
the compound was dissolved in CH
2Cl2, then derivatization to the
triﬂuoroacetamide was performed by adding a 20-fold excess
of triﬂuoroacetic anhydride. After purging with nitrogen to remove
excess anhydride and residual triﬂuoroacetic acid, the derivatized
compound was dissolved in CH2Cl2 and analyzed.
Growth selection of CHAO libraries for converting (S)-3
The CHAO libraries with medium, weak, and very weak constitutive
promoters were transformed into electrocompetent cells ofE. coli
BL21 (DE3) containing the plasmid SCm-KatE (constitutively
expressing the catalase fromE. coli) by the same electroporation
procedure as described above. A small portion of the cells (20μl)
was used to test the electroporation efﬁciency and half of the cells
were used to prepare the plasmids of the libraries. The other half of
the cells were centrifuged (5 min, 4000 ×g), and the supernatant of
the LB medium was removed. The cell pellets were resuspended in
M9 liquid medium (2 ml) containing appropriate antibiotics
( 2 5m gl
−1 kanamycin and 12.5 mg l−1 ampicillin) and (S)-3 (1 mM) as
the sole nitrogen source. Methyl laurate (0.5 ml) was added into the
aqueous M9 medium as a growth-compatible second phase. The
two-phase cultures were kept in an incubator (30 °C, 200 rpm), and
diluted (10×) in fresh M9 medium every 24 h 5 times (5 days in
total). The dilution was performed by adding existing aqueous
culture (200μl) into fresh M9 medium (1.8 ml) containing appro-
priate antibiotics (25 mg l
−1 kanamycin and 12.5 mg l−1 ampicillin)
and (S)-3 (1 mM) and fresh methyl laurate (0.5 ml). Photos of the
cultures were taken and the optical densities were measured every
24 h. An aliquot (50μl) of the enriched culture of the CHAO library
with medium expressing level was spread on an LB agar plate
containing kanamycin (50 mg l
−1) for isolation of single colonies
(37 °C, for 24 h). The representative colonies were picked and
transferred into LB liquid medium (5 ml) containing kanamycin
(50 mg l
−1) for preparation of cell stocks and plasmids for
sequencing.

Deracemization ofrac-3 by CHAOs, catalase, and NH3-BH3
Fresh E. colicells containing the vectors pRSF-CHAO(MVLM) or pRSF-
CHAO(wt) and SCm-KatE were employed as whole-cell catalysts for the
reaction. The cell pellets of a 50-ml culture wereﬁrst washed with Tris-
HCl buffer (100 mM, pH 8.0) and subjected to centrifugation again
(4000 ×g, 15 min). The supernatant was discarded and the cell pellets
were resuspended in new Tris-HCl buffer (100 mM, pH 8.0) and the
optical density of the cell suspensions was measured. To a reaction vial
(20 ml) with screwcap, a stock solution ofrac-3 (500 mM HCl salt in
water), a stock solution of NH
3-BH3 (1 M in Tris-HCl buffer), Tris-HCl
buffer (100 mM, pH 8.0), andn-dodecane (1 ml) were added to form a
two-phase catalytic system composed of the aqueous buffer (1 ml)
containing rac-3 (25 mM), NH
3-BH3 (500 mM) and the organic phase
(1 ml). The cell suspensions were added to start the reaction (ﬁnal
density of cells in aqueous phase was 10 g l−1 dcw, dry cell weight).
Thirty-six reaction vials were incubated at 30 °C, 200 rpm for 4 h (the
caps were opened for venting at 1 and 2 h for 1 min). To monitor
the progress of the reaction, NaOH solution (5 M, 100μl) was added to
the reaction vials at different times (0, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, and 4 h) to stop the
reaction. Then,n-hexane (1 ml) was added to the vial for extraction. The
organic phase (n-hexane orn-dodecane) was centrifuged (12,000 ×g,
3 min) and an aliquot of the supernatant (100μl) was mixed with
n-hexane (900μl, containing 2 mM ethylbenzene as internal standard)
for simultaneous chiral HPLC analysis of the conversion andee.
Growth selection of PcPAL libraries for converting (S)-5
The PcPAL libraries with strong, medium, and weak constitutive pro-
moters were transformed into electrocompetent cells ofE. coliBL21
(DE3) ΔtyrB containing the plasmid SCm-AroP (constitutively expres-
sing the aromatic amino acid transporter fromE. coli) by the same
electroporation procedure as described above. A small portion of the
cells (20μl) was used to test the electroporation efﬁciency and half of
the cells were used to prepare the plasmids of the libraries. The other
half of the cells were centrifuged (5 min, 4000 g), and the supernatant
of the LB medium was removed. The cell pellets were resuspended in
M9 liquid medium (2 ml) containing appropriate antibiotics (25 mg l
−1
kanamycin and 12.5 mg l−1 ampicillin) and (S)-5 (1 mM) as the sole
nitrogen source. The cultures were kept in an incubator (30 °C,
200 rpm), and diluted (10x) in fresh M9 medium every 24 h 5 times
(5 days in total). The dilution was performed by adding the existing
aqueous culture (200μl) into fresh M9 medium (1.8 ml) containing
appropriate antibiotics (25 mg l
−1 kanamycin and 12.5 mg l−1 ampicillin)
and (S)-5 (1 mM). The optical densities of the cultures were measured
for the last three days, and a photo was taken at the end of enrichment.
The enriched culture of PcPAL library with strong expressing level was
spread on an LB agar plate containing kanamycin (50 mg l
−1)f o ri s o -
lation of single colonies (37 °C, for 24 h). The representative colonies
were picked and transferred into LB liquid medium (5 ml) containing
kanamycin (50 mg l
−1) for preparation of cell stocks and plasmids for
sequencing.
Asymmetric synthesis of (S)-5 by PcPAL variants
Fresh E. coli cells containing the vectors pRSF-PcPAL(AI) or pRSF-
PcPAL(wt) were employed as whole-cell catalysts for the reaction. The
cell pellets from a 50-ml culture were resuspended in NH
3/NH4Cl
buffer (6 M, pH 10.0) and the optical density of the cell suspensions
was measured. To a reaction vial (20 ml) with a screwcap, a stock
solution of6 (1 M in DMSO) and NH
3/NH4Cl buffer (6 M, pH 10.0) were
added to form a catalytic system (1 ml) containing6 (22 mM). The cell
suspensions were added to start the reaction (ﬁnal density of cells was
5gd c wl−1). Forty-two reaction vials were incubated at 30 °C, 200 rpm
for 2 h. To monitor the progress of the reaction, HCl solution (6 M,
1 ml) was added to the reaction vials at different times (0, 5, 10, 20, 30,
60, and 120 min) to stop the reaction. To determine the conversion,
methanol (2 ml, containing 2 mM acetophenone as the internal
standard) was added to the vial. An aliquot of the mixture (1 ml) was
centrifuged (12,000 ×g, 10 min), and an aliquot of the supernatant
(700μl) was used for HPLC analysis of the conversion. To determine
the ee of 5, methanol (300μl) was added to the vial. The mixture was
centrifuged (12,000 ×g, 10 min), and an aliquot of the supernatant
(700μl) was used for chiral HPLC analysis.
