ABSTRACT
We previously isolated the transaminase KES23458 fromPseudomonas sp. strain AAC as a promising biocatalyst for the produc-
tion of 12-aminododecanoic acid, a constituent building block of nylon-12. Here, we report the subsequent characterization of
this transaminase. It exhibits activity with a broad substrate range which includes/H9251-, /H9252-, and/H9275-amino acids, as well as/H9251,/H9275-di-
amines and a number of other industrially relevant compounds. It is therefore a prospective candidate for the biosynthesis of a
range of polyamide monomers. The crystal structure of KES23458 revealed that the protein forms a dimer containing a large ac-
tive site pocket and unusual phosphorylated histidine residues. To infer the physiological role of the transaminase, we expressed,
puriﬁed, and characterized a dehydrogenase from the same operon, KES23460. Unlike the transaminase, the dehydrogenase was
shown to be quite selective, catalyzing the oxidation of malonic acid semialdehyde, formed from/H9252-alanine transamination via
KES23458. In keeping with previous reports, the dehydrogenase was shown to catalyze both a coenzyme A (CoA)-dependent re-
action to form acetyl-CoA and a signiﬁcantly slower CoA-independent reaction to form acetate. These ﬁndings support the origi-
nal functional assignment of KES23458 as a/H9252-alanine transaminase. However, a seemingly well-adapted active site and promis-
cuity toward unnatural compounds, such as 12-aminododecanoic acid, suggest that this enzyme could perform multiple
functions forPseudomonas sp. strain AAC.
IMPORTANCE
We describe the characterization of an industrially relevant transaminase able to metabolize 12-aminododecanoic acid, a con-
stituent building block of the widely used polymer nylon-12, and we report the biochemical and structural characterization
of the transaminase protein. A physiological role for this highly promiscuous enzyme is proposed based on the character-
ization of a related gene from the host organism. Molecular dynamics simulations were carried out to compare the confor-
mational changes in the transaminase protein to better understand the determinants of speciﬁcity in the protein. This
study makes asubstantial contribution that is of interest to the broad biotechnology and enzymology communities, providing
insights into the catalytic activity of an industrially relevant biocatalyst as well as the biological function of this operon.
E
nzymes are typically thought of as highly selective, making it
possible to avoid side reactions associated with analogous
(nonenzymatic) chemical reactions and produce high yields of
single products. However, it is perhaps underappreciated that en-
zymes can possess very broad substrate speciﬁcities, a key require-
ment for their evolutionary adaptability, as this allows for the
development of new catalytic capabilities when required for sur-
vival or competitive advantage (
1–3). For example, the ability of
microorganisms to degrade nonnatural chemicals, such as pesti-
cides or synthetic antibiotics, has resulted in new metabolic path-
ways for resistance and catabolism over relatively short periods of
evolutionary time (
4, 5). Although these proteins often evolve for
catabolic purposes in the microorganisms involved, these newly
evolved functions represent an opportunity from a biocatalytic
perspective.
/H9275-Transaminases (/H9275-TAs) are renowned for their promiscuity
and have exhibited catalytic prowess in the synthesis of unnatural
compounds (
6). The ability of these enzymes to act on foreign
molecules has drawn widespread interest from both academia and
industry, and while they are used widely in the synthesis of chiral
building blocks (
7), they can also be used to produce more com-
plex synthetic pharmaceuticals. For example, sitagliptin, an an-
tidiabetes compound, can be synthesized using a transaminase-
mediated process which provides improvements in both yield,
enantiomeric excess, and productivity relative to alternative
chemocatalytic methods (
8). Transaminases, including /H9275-TAs,
are pyridoxal-5=-phosphate (PLP)-dependent enzymes that trans-
fer amine groups from molecules containing a primary amine (the
amine donor) to acceptor molecules, aldehydes or ketones (
9).
PLP acts as a carrier for the amine group, forming pyridoxamine-

5=-phosphate (PMP) as an intermediate in the reaction. The abil-
ity to install amine groups, often in an enantioselective manner, is
highly attractive, and when used to synthesize expensive prod-
ucts using relatively cheap amine donors such as isopropyl-
amine, these methods can also become more economical. Al-
though /H9275-transaminases are reported to have some limitations,
such as low thermotolerance, substrate and product inhibition,
and equilibrium-controlled yields, complementary methods have
been developed to address these issues (
7, 10–12). In addition,
there are a number of X-ray structures available for/H9275-TAs, and
despite having highly conserved tertiary and quaternary struc-
tures, the enzymes exhibit conformational changes upon binding,
and this conformational heterogeneity has been reported to make
signiﬁcant contributions to substrate speciﬁcity (
13). Given the
low homology (/H1102130%) among the class (14, 15), an understand-
ing of the sequence-function relationship of these enzymes can be
challenging and is typically only possible with a detailed under-
standing of the interactions between an enzyme and its substrate
(
8, 16).
Previously, we characterized a number of transaminases
from Pseudomonas sp. strain AAC (NCBI accession number
PRJNA248604), some of which were able to metabolize 12-amin-
ododecanoic acid, a nonnatural compound with potential as a
building block for industrial nylon-12 synthesis (
17). Hazards as-
sociated with the synthesis of nylon-12 (18), as well as global
shortages of the material in recent years (19), have afforded op-
portunities for the application of biocatalysis within the materials
ﬁeld (
20), and a number of examples have been reported to date
(21, 22). However, while most organisms are unable to metabolize
12-aminododecanoic acid, thePseudomonas sp. strain AAC bac-
terium contains three enzymes with activity against the com-
pound. Catalytic promiscuity is often thought to be the result of an
enzymatic activity that was acquired coincidentally and evolved
under selective pressure. In this case, the substrate is neither toxic
nor abundant in the environment, and it is unlikely that there was
a strong selective pressure to evolve with a metabolic activity
against the compound. Examples of secondary reactions which
provide no apparent beneﬁt and are only encountered under lab-
oratory conditions, such as the dechlorination of chloropurines by
adenosine deaminase (
23), have been reported, and without fur-
ther evidence it is more likely that this is the case forPseudomonas
sp. strain AAC. However, the discovery of three genes encoding
proteins with this activity within the same organism suggests that
the compound has a broader metabolic context, or that the genes
coevolved from a single parent gene (
24).
As stated above, amongPseudomonas sp. strain AAC proteins,
three transaminases were identiﬁed with 12-aminododecanoic
acid activity: KES24511, KES23458, and KES23360. The most
promising candidate biocatalyst in terms of ease of protein pro-
duction, solubility, and activity was KES23458, and here we report
the subsequent characterization of that protein.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials. A codon-optimized synthetic gene encoding KES23460 was
synthesized by Life Technologies (Germany). All chemicals were pur-
chased from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (USA).
Cloning, expression, and puriﬁcation. Cloning of KES23458 from
genomic DNA has been described previously (
17). Protein overexpression
was achieved by growing a culture ofEscherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells
transformed with KES23458 inside a pETcc2 vector in LB medium con-
taining ampicillin (100/H9262g/ml) at 37°C. When the optical density at 600
nm (OD600) reached 0.6 to 1.0, the culture was induced by the addition of
IPTG (isopropyl /H9252-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside; 1 mM ﬁnal concentra-
tion) and further incubated at 37°C for 18 h. The cells were isolated by
centrifugation in a Beckman Avanti J-E centrifuge (3,000/H11003g; 20 min),
and the supernatant was discarded. The pellet was resuspended in imida-
zole-potassium phosphate buffer (5 mM imidazole, 10 mM phosphate;
pH 7.5), and cell lysis was achieved by homogenization at 20,000 lb/in
2
using an Avestin Emulsiﬂex-C3 apparatus. Cellular debris was precipi-
tated by centrifugation (40,000/H11003g; 45 min), and the supernatant was
passed over a HiTrap chelating HP column (GE Healthcare, Little Chalf-
ont, United Kingdom) on an Åkta fast protein liquid chromatography
(FPLC) system (GE Healthcare). Protein was eluted with an increasing
concentration of imidazole (5 to 500 mM), and the fractions containing
protein were transferred into potassium phosphate buffer (10 mM; pH
7.5), concentrated by centrifugation (10,000 molecular weight cutoff
[MWCO]; GE Healthcare), and further puriﬁed by gel ﬁltration (Super-
dex 200; GE Healthcare) in the same phosphate buffer. Purity was esti-
mated to be/H1102295% by SDS-PAGE.
A gene encoding KES23460, codon optimized for expression inE. coli,
was ordered in the expression vector pRSetB from Life Technologies (Ger-
many). E. coli BL21(DE3) was transformed with pRSetB containing the
gene encoding KES23460, and overexpression and puriﬁcation of
KES23460 was achieved in the same manner as described for KES23458.
Protein crystallization.The concentrated protein (8 mg/ml) was used
to set up initial crystallization trials (a total of 384 experiments, with the
JCSG/H11001screen at 8°C and 20°C and the PACT [pH, anion, and cation
testing] screen and an in-house pH-versus-salt gradient screen both at
20°C). The crystallization droplets consisted of 200 nl protein (8 mg/ml in
10 mM potassium phosphate buffer [pH 7.5]) and 200 nl crystallization
cocktail, equilibrated against 50/H9262l of the cocktail in SD-2 sitting drop
plates (Molecular Dimensions, Suffolk, United Kingdom). The best crys-
tals grew from midweight polyethylene glycols (PEG) in the presence of
magnesium (e.g., 10% [wt/vol] PEG 4000, 0.2 M magnesium chloride,
and 0.1 M Tris-HCl [pH 7]). Crystals appeared within hours and grew to
full size (70/H9262mb y7 0/H9262mb y2 0 0/H9262m) within days. Crystals were selected
and cryoprotected by the addition of reservoir solution supplemented
with 20% glycerol and ﬂash-cooled in N
2.
Data collection and structural determination.For an initial native
data set, 360° of data were collected from a single crystal (1° oscillations) to
yield a complete X-ray data set to 1.33-Å resolution; a later data set was
collected to 1.24 Å, and this higher-resolution data set is summarized
below in
Table 3. XDS (25) was used to index the reﬂections, and SCALA
(26) was used to scale the data. The structure was solved by molecular
replacement using Phaser (27) and was based on the/H9275-amino acid:pyru-
vate aminotransferase fromPseudomonas putida(PDB accession number
3A8U)( 28). A single protomer was placed in the asymmetric unit, rebuilt
manually using Coot (29), and reﬁned using Refmac (30). Details of the
data collection and reﬁnement are shown inTable 3.
All data sets were collected at the MX-2 beamline of the Australian
Synchrotron. Additional data sets beyond the initial native data set were
processed in the manner described above (but were solved using the na-
tive structure, rebuilt with Coot, and reﬁned with Refmac).
Phosphoprotein staining. Sample preparation for ProQ Diamond
phosphoprotein staining was carried out following the manufacturer’s
protocol (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc). Puriﬁed KES23458 (40/H9262l, 5 mg/ml)
with or without gabaculine (20/H9262l, 10 mg/ml), as well as crude cell lysate
and bovine serum albumin (20/H9262l, 10 mg/ml) were analyzed. Staining was
carried out following the manufacturer’s guidelines, and gel visualization
was carried out using a Typhoon Trio system (GE Healthcare), with an
excitation wavelength of 532 nm, an emission wavelength of 555 nm, and
a 500-V photomultiplier tube.
Assaying for activity.Activity for KES23458 was assessed using en-
zyme-coupled dehydrogenase assay mixtures typically comprising sub-
strate (5 mM ﬁnal concentration in potassium phosphate buffer [100

mM; pH 10]), cosubstrate (pyruvate [0.5 mM ﬁnal concentration] or
/H9251-ketoglutarate [/H9251-KG; 0.25 mM ﬁnal concentration]), NAD (1.25 mM
ﬁnal concentration;ε340 of 6,220 M/H110021 cm/H110021), dehydrogenase (0.035 U of
alanine dehydrogenase [ADH], where 1 U corresponds to the amount of
enzyme which converts 1/H9262mol L-alanine per minute at pH 10.0 and 30°C,
or 0.925 U of glutamate dehydrogenase [GDH], where 1 U will reduce 1
/H9262mol of /H9251-ketoglutarate to
L-glutamate per min at pH 7.3 at 25°C) in
potassium phosphate buffer (100 mM; pH 7 to 10). Following the addi-
tion of the transaminase enzyme, UV absorbance at 340 nm was recorded
at 28°C for 30 min on a SpectraMax M2 UV photospectrometer (Molec-
ular Devices, Australia). For amination reactions, a typical assay mixture
comprised substrate (5 mM), alanine (0.25 mM), NADH (0.125 mM),
(NH
4)2SO4 (10 mM), ADH (0.035 U), and transaminase. The reaction
was followed by recording the hypochromic shift at 340 nm in a UV
spectrophotometer.
Thermotolerance was determined by residual activity measurements.
A potassium phosphate solution of the transaminase was incubated over a
range of temperatures (23 to 68°C) for 5 min, centrifuged brieﬂy to re-
move precipitate, and transferred to a UV spectrophotometer for testing
using the transaminase assay described above.
Determination of KES23460 activity was achieved using an analogous
transaminase-coupled assay (
Fig. 1b). KES23458 was added to substrate
(5 mM), pyruvate (0.5 mM), cofactor (NAD or NADH; 1.25 mM), and
KES23460 in potassium phosphate buffer (100 mM; pH 9). Changes in
absorbance at 340 nm were monitored for up to 30 min.
Mass spectrometry.Protein size was conﬁrmed by mass spectrometry
using an Agilent 1100 series LC with a TOF (time of ﬂight) mass spec-
trometer and Agilent Masshunter workstation (v. A.02.02). A 5-/H9262l vol-
ume of puriﬁed KES23458 (1.85 mg/ml) was injected into a mobile phase
of water (plus 0.1% formic acid) and acetonitrile (plus 0.1% formic acid)
(50:50 [vol/vol]; ﬂow rate, 0.8 ml/min) and analyzed in positive electros-
pray ionization mode for 2 min. The mass spectrometer was set to detect
ions with anm/z between 200 and 3,000 with a fragmentor voltage of 225
V. The mass spectrum was deconvoluted using Agilent Protein TOF con-
ﬁrmation software (v. 1.01.00), with a limitedm/z range of 600 to 3,000
and a signal/noise threshold of 30, to yield H
/H11001adducts of monomeric
KES23458 with or without PLP. A molar excess of sodium borohydride
was used to ensure complete reduction of PLP.
Docking studies.The volume of the active site pocket was calculated
using the CASTp server (31).
Models of KES23458 were prepared in Accelrys Discovery Studio v.
3.5, using the PDB ﬁle from the experimentally derived structure as a
FIG 1 (a) Alanine dehydrogenase-coupled UV assay for transaminase activity. The transaminase catalyzes the amine transfer from the substrate to pyruvate
(cosubstrate), producing alanine as a coproduct. The dehydrogenase then catalyzes the oxidative deamination of alanine utilizing a cofactor, NAD/H11001(NAD),
which is concurrently reduced to NADH. Formation of NADH can be detected by UV photospectrometry as a hyperchromic shift at 340 nm. (b) Analogous
assays performed with KES23460. In this case the transaminase reaction shown is the/H9252-alanine/pyruvate transamination reaction. If CoA is present, malonate
semialdehyde produced by transamination is then converted by KES23460 to acetyl-CoA in an NAD/H11001dependent reaction (shown in bold). Without CoA present
malonate semialdehyde is converted to acetate and bicarbonate (shown in gray). Both of these reactions require the conversion of NAD/H11001to NADH, which can
be followed by UV photospectrometry at 340 nm. Based on spectrophotometric data, and the value of acetyl-CoA as a metabolic intermediate, the CoA-
dependent pathway is likely to be the physiologically relevant reaction for these genes.

starting point and removing small molecules and water by using the clean
protein tool. Models for the/H9252-alanine:PLP and 12-aminododecanoic ac-
id:PLP external aldimine intermediates were created in Accelrys Discov-
ery Studio v. 3.5 and prepared for docking using the full minimization tool
in Discovery Studio v. 3.5 with the default settings (CHARMm force
ﬁeld). Atomic charges were calculated using Accelrys Materials Studio v.
8.0 with the QEq method, and the substrates were manually docked into
the active site. The protein models were solvated in a TIP3P octahedral
solvent box with a 12-Å periodic boundary and charge neutralized by the
addition of Na
/H11001ions.
Initial minimization on both systems was performed in Amber (v. 14)
over 10,000 steps under a constant pressure of 105 Pa. Bond lengths for
bonds involving hydrogen were constrained in Shake, and force evalua-
tion of these bonds was not performed. Molecular dynamics (MD) sim-
ulations (200 ns) with a step size of 0.002 ps were performed at 310 K and
10
5 Pa pressure with a 2-ps relaxation time. Simulations were visualized in
VMD (v. 1.9.2), and root mean square deviation (RMSD) analysis was
performed using the RMSD Trajectory tool. Analysis was conducted on
150 ns of the simulation, removing the ﬁrst 50 ns to ensure the systems
were equilibrated.
Saturation mutagenesis protocol. Mutagenesis of the DNA from
Pseudomonas sp. AAC encoding KES23458 was achieved using a
QuikChange Lightning Multi site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent). An
annealing temperature of 60°C was selected, and 1.5% dimethyl sulfoxide
was added to the reaction mixture (R414NDT mutagenic primer, 5=-GAAG
GAAGGCTTCTACGTGNDTTTCGGCGGCGACACCCTGCAG-3=). All
other elements of the protocol were as described in the manufacturer’s
guidelines. The CGC codon, which encodes arginine, was mutated using a
degenerate NDT codon (
32). The resulting DNA was transformed intoE.
coli BL21 /H9261DE3 cells by electroporation and plated on LB agar containing
ampicillin (LB-Amp; 100/H9262g/ml ampicillin).
Thirty-ﬁve individual colonies (/H1102295% coverage) were picked from
the LB agar plates. An additionalE. colicolony containing the wild-type
(WT) DNA was also picked and added as a positive control, for a total of
36 colonies. Each colony was used to inoculate 200/H9262l LB containing
ampicillin (100/H9262g/ml) in a 96-well plate. This plate (the “mother plate”)
was incubated overnight at 37°C with shaking (700 rpm). Ten-microliter
aliquots were taken from each well and added to 1 ml LB-Amp in a 96-
deep-well block (the “daughter block”). The daughter block was incu-
bated at 37°C for 4 h with shaking (1,000 rpm), while the mother plate was
transferred to storage at 4°C. IPTG was added to each well (1 mM, ﬁnal
concentration) of the daughter block, which was then further incubated
overnight at 37°C with shaking.
The daughter block was centrifuged at 3,000/H11003g for 20 min, and the
supernatants were discarded. To each well, 10/H9262l BugBuster (10/H11003reagent;
EMD Millipore) and 90/H9262l potassium phosphate buffer (100 mM; pH 7.5)
were added, and the block was incubated for1ha t4 ° Ca n dﬁnally centri-
fuged at 4,750/H11003g for 45 min. The 100/H9262l of supernatant from each well
was transferred to the corresponding well in a new 96-well “stock” plate
and stored at 4°C.
For activity screening, 5/H9262l supernatant from each well of the stock
plate was added to the standard assay mixture described previously, where
the substrate was a saturated solution of 12-aminododecanoic acid. UV
absorbance at 340 nm was monitored for1ha t 1-min intervals. Hits were
identiﬁed as those exhibiting a hyperchromic absorbance change. For
each hit, a new 10-ml culture of LB containing ampicillin (100/H9262g/ml) was
inoculated using the corresponding culture from the mother plate and
incubated at 37°C overnight with shaking. DNA was isolated from the
cells by using a Bioline Isolate II plasmid minikit, and DNA was sequenced
by Macrogen Inc. (Seoul, South Korea).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
KES23458 was previously shown to catalyze the transamination of
two substrates, /H9252-alanine and 12-aminododecanoic acid. Given
the large difference in sizes between its hypothetical natural sub-
strate and the observed promiscuous substrate (/H9252-alanine and 12-
aminododecanoic acid, respectively), we anticipated that the en-
zyme could potentially catalyze all the homologous substrates in
between (i.e., C
4 to C11) to produce a range of polyamide building
blocks. As such, we sought to further characterize this enzyme,
both in terms of promiscuity and its physiological role with the
Pseudomonas sp. strain AAC.
Substrate speciﬁcity and characterization of KES23458.The
promiscuity of the transaminase was assessed using a well-estab-
lished, dehydrogenase-coupled assay (
Fig. 1a) with a broad range
of substrates (50 compounds [see Fig. S1 in the supplemental ma-
terial]). KES23458 was found to be highly promiscuous, exhibit-
ing activity with 39 of the compounds tested. These included a
broad range of different amines, including/H9251-, /H9252-, and /H9275-amino
acids, aminated cyclic substrates, and a selection of diamines, as
well as aldehydes and ketones (substrates along with their speciﬁc
and relative activities are shown in
Table 1). Unfortunately, as
alanine dehydrogenase is strongly inhibited by low millimolar
concentrations of pyruvate (in the same manner as other similar
dehydrogenases) (
33), it was not possible to determine steady-
state kinetics by this method. However, it was possible to obtain
speciﬁc activity data for the transaminase and begin to understand
its substrate preferences. As anticipated, the enzyme was observed
to catalyze the transamination of/H9275-aminoalkanoates ranging in
length from C
3 to C12, with speciﬁc activities ranging from 126.1
(C12) to 699.7 (C8) nmol · min/H110021 ·m g/H110021, although no obvious
correlation between substrate size and speciﬁc activity was ob-
served (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). In addition, the
enzyme was also able to turn over a range of aliphatic/H9251//H9275-di-
amines with speciﬁc activities ranging from 24.7 (C
3) to 679.9
(C10) nmol · min/H110021 ·m g/H110021. Like the /H9275-amino acids, these di-
amines have applications in the production of polymers, notably
6,6-hexamethylenediamine for the production of nylon-6,6, and
as such KES23458 is a promising biocatalyst for the production of
a range of nylon building blocks. As with the amino acid sub-
strates, no clear correlation between the size of the diamine sub-
strate and enzyme activity was observed (see Fig. S2).
The transaminase also exhibited activity with monofunction-
alized aliphatic aldehydes, such as butyraldehyde, octanal, and
decanal, with the highest speciﬁc activity observed for butyralde-
hyde (295.8 nmol · min
/H110021 ·m g/H110021). The other aldehydes had sig-
niﬁcantly lower activities; heptanal, octanal, and decanal showed
speciﬁc activities of 7, 8, and 14%, respectively, relative to butyr-
aldehyde. However, this may have been the result of lower effec-
tive concentrations of these compounds due to their low aqueous
solubilities. Again, as with the amino acids and diamines, there
was no clear correlation between the length of the aliphatic chain
of the substrate and enzyme activity (see Fig. S2 in the supplemen-
tal material). Finally, KES23458 showed activity against the bio-
logically and industrially relevant compounds 5-hydroxymethyl-
furfural (HMF; speciﬁc activity, 40.9 nmol · min
/H110021 ·m g/H110021) and
glyceraldehyde (speciﬁc activity, 101 nmol · min/H110021 ·m g/H110021), both
of which have been identiﬁed by the U.S. Department of Energy as
bioreﬁnery product opportunities from carbohydrates (34).
In addition to a broad substrate range, the thermotolerance of
Characterization of a/H9252-Alanine Catabolic Pathway

the enzyme was assessed by assaying residual activity after heat
treatment. Using this method, 50% residual activity was observed
after preincubation at 63°C, and only 5% residual activity was
observed after a 68°C incubation (see Fig. S3A in the supplemental
material). Another estimate of the thermostability of the enzyme
was obtained by differential scanning ﬂuorimentry (DSF), in
which the ﬂuorescence of an environmentally sensitive dye is used
to follow the unfolding of a protein. By this method, the melting
temperature was determined to be 58°C (see Fig. S3B).
Transaminase crystallization and structural elucidation.We
undertook crystallographic analysis in an effort to understand the
structural basis for the broad substrate speciﬁcity exhibited by the
transaminase. The transaminase was expressed and puriﬁed by
afﬁnity chromatography as described above and then further pu-
riﬁed by gel ﬁltration (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material).
Based on its elution proﬁle, the transaminase was predicted to
exist as a dimer in solution (described in more detail in Materials
and Methods), consistent with other known structures of
/H9275-transaminases (
13, 14). The protein was concentrated to 8 mg/
ml, and initial crystallization trials were carried out at 8 and 20°C.
Crystals were observed within hours in a number of wells contain-
ing polyethylene glycol, and although most of the crystals were
thin plates, chunky rectangular prisms (see Fig. S5 in the supple-
mental material), which diffracted X-rays to better than 1.4 Å,
were observed under optimal conditions (described in Materials
and Methods). Despite having different morphologies, most crys-
tals were found to be in the I222 space group with approximately
the same cell dimensions. The molecules in the initial, well-dif-
fracting crystals appeared to pack in a way which would hinder
access to the active site. Cocrystallization trials with 8-amino-
octanoic acid, 12-aminododecanoic acid,
D/L-3-aminoisobutyric
acid, /H9252-alanine, and a common TA suicide inhibitor, gabaculine,
in both broad (initial) screens and ﬁne screens under the initial
conditions also failed to yield structures with any obvious electron
density for a small molecule. In addition, our lack of success with
substrate soaking experiments may have been the result of occlu-
sion of the active site by the crystal packing.
The structure revealed a dimeric/H9251//H9252-fold protein with a total
surface area of about 37,000 Å
2 and a buried surface of 2,880 Å2,
according to information in the PISA database (35), conﬁrming
the gel ﬁltration results. On comparison with other available
/H9275-transaminase structures from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
Chromobacterium violaceum(87% and 29% sequence identity to
KES23458, respectively; PDB accession numbers
4B98 and 4A6T),
KES23458 was observed to be similar, with backbone RMS values
of 0.2 Å and 1.3 Å, respectively (

illustrating that despite low sequence homology, overall structural
conservation remains high in this enzyme class.
The dimer contained two long active sites; each was a large,
solvent-accessible cavity comprised of residues from both mono-
mers (
Fig. 2, upper right structure), with a Connolly surface vol-
ume of 1,771 Å3. This is sufﬁcient to completely enclose substrates
as large as 12-aminododecanoic acid and in part rationalizes the
broad substrate speciﬁcity observed for the enzyme. It is unclear,
however, why such a large active site cavity has evolved when the
physiological substrate and cosubstrate are/H9252-alanine and pyru-

vate, respectively, or how selective ingress of the physiological
substrate is achieved. It is possible that this protein may perform
more than one physiological function within the organism, which
is consistent with the high levels of activity observed with multiple
substrates.
Examination of the electron density in the presumed active site
showed a close analogue of PLP (denoted PLP=) bound where one
would expect to ﬁnd the native cofactor. This density could not be
resolved but was atypical for a molecule of PLP. It is unclear why
native PLP was not seen in these very-high-resolution data sets, as
additional experiments were set up with fresh PLP added to the
protein and yielded the same anomalous result. Each PLP= was
coordinated to Gly
120, Ser121, Tyr153 Asp259, Lys288, and Thr327=
(where the prime sign denotes that the residue is from the other
monomer of the transaminase) via hydrogen bonding, and al-
though PLP is typically bound to the protein by a covalent bond
(an internal or external aldimine) (
36) with an active site lysine
residue, aldimine-bound PLP was not observed in the structure.
However, when overlaid against other transaminase crystal struc-
tures (PDB accession numbers
4B98 and 4A6T)( 13), a homolo-
gous lysine residue (Lys288) lying 2.4 Å from the cofactor was
apparent, and is likely to fulﬁl that role in KES23458 (Fig. 2, bot-
tom right structure). Further analysis of the enzyme-cofactor
complex was carried out by mass spectrometry, which conﬁrmed
the identity of the full-length peptide minus the N-terminal me-
thionine (see Fig. S5 and the sequence detailed in the supplemen-
tal material). Both the apo- and holo-forms of the protein were
observed in the spectrum, with the mass gain corresponding to
aldimine-bound unmodiﬁed PLP. No additional peaks which
could correspond to PLP analogues were observed in the spec-
trum. Treatment with sodium borohydride was also used to re-
duce the aldimine and bind the cofactor irreversibly. The resultant
mass spectrum showed a deconvoluted peakm/z of 50,399, corre-
sponding to the reduced form of KES23458 and PLP, supporting
the presence of PLP in the protein (rather than an analogue), as
well as conﬁrming aldimine bond formation. As such, we suggest
that the PLP= analogue observed in the crystal structures is an
artifact of the crystallization process, rather than a novel PLP-like
cofactor.
The protein was found to contain phosphorylated histidine
residues at positions 31 and 360 (
Fig. 2, upper left panel struc-
tures). Studies of histidine phosphorylation are less extensive than
for other amino acids, such as serine, threonine, and tyrosine, as a
consequence of the acid lability of the phosphate group (
37).
However, protein phosphorylation by histidine kinases is known
to be important in prokaryotic signal transduction (
38), and an
increasing number of histidine kinase activities in higher eu-
karyotes have been identiﬁed (
39, 40). The acid lability of phos-
phohistidine also hindered mass spectrometry characterization,
so phosphoprotein staining was used to conﬁrm phosphorylation
of KES23458. The transaminase was treated with gabaculine to
irreversibly bind the PLP and prevent reformation of an internal
aldimine complex with Lys
288. The protein was then boiled to
remove the gabaculine:PLP complex, and visualization of the
SDS-PAGE gel using ﬂuorescence (detailed in Materials and
Methods) conﬁrmed that despite removal of the phosphorylated
cofactor, the protein still contained phosphate, supporting the
X-ray data. Although the role of this posttranslational modiﬁca-
tion remains unclear, and it may simply be an artifact of heterol-
ogous expression, phosphorylation of histidine residues at the
surface of KES23458 is apparent, and under certain crystallo-
graphic conditions these unusual moieties are retained and ob-
served.
Physiological role for KES23458.Interestingly, the speciﬁc ac-
tivity for the proposed natural substrate,/H9252-alanine, was only 54%
of the activity measured for 8-aminooctanoic acid, which was the
preferred substrate under the assay conditions. This observation,
together with the large active site, prompted further investigations
to probe the physiological role of the transaminase. Attempts to
knock out the KES23458 gene fromPseudomonas sp. strain AAC
were unsuccessful (using the Gene Bridges K006 kit, designed for
E. coli). However, analysis of the genetic organization surrounding
the gene suggested that it may form a bicistronic operon with a
putative dehydrogenase protein, KES23460. KES23460 was suc-
cessfully cloned, expressed, and characterized. Based on the pep-
tide sequence of the dehydrogenase, the enzyme was putatively
assigned the function of methylmalonate semialdehyde dehydro-
genase, which could be accessed by the transamination reaction of
aminoisobutyrate. However, because KES23458 had exhibited a
wide substrate scope, the activity of the dehydrogenase was tested
with a number of substrates (shown in Table S1 in the supplemen-
tal material). Substrates were selected based on prior activity with
KES23458 and were assayed with the dehydrogenase by coupling
it to KES23458 as well as the oxidized and reduced forms of both
NAD and NADP cofactors. Absorbance at 340 nm was observed,
anticipating that the aldehydes produced by transamination
would be further converted by the dehydrogenase and that the
concurrent oxidation or reduction of the nicotinamide cofactor
could be monitored at 340 nm. Unlike the transaminase, the de-
hydrogenase was shown to be more selective, having signiﬁcant
activity with only one of the substrates tested, malonic acid semi-
aldehyde, which formed following the transamination of/H9252-ala-
nine.
Based on previous investigations with malonate semialdehyde
dehydrogenases (
41–44), KES23460 was further investigated to
conﬁrm its function. In keeping with previous ﬁndings for IolA
(44% sequence identity to KES23460), a methylmalonate semial-
dehyde dehydrogenase from Bacillus subtilis, KES23460, was
shown to facilitate the oxidative conversion of malonic acid semi-
aldehyde both with and without CoA. In the presence of CoA, the
transthioesteriﬁcation step was observed to be signiﬁcantly faster
(approximately 10-fold) than the hydrolysis when no CoA was
present, and this was also consistent with previous ﬁndings (
44). It
is plausible, based on the speciﬁcity of the dehydrogenase, that
KES23458 and KES23460 form a/H9252-alanine catabolic pathway in
which malonic acid semialdehyde is produced from/H9252-alanine by
KES23458-mediated amine transfer and then converted to the
common metabolic intermediate acetyl-CoA in an NAD-depen-
dent oxidation by KES23460. The reduction of acetyl-CoA by
KES23460 using NADH was also tested, but it could not be de-
tected under the conditions tested; based on the rates we observed,
we concluded that this operon appears to form a/H9252-alanine cata-
bolic pathway within Pseudomonas sp. strain AAC, producing
acetyl-CoA.
Molecular dynamics study of KES23458 with/H9252-alanine and
12-aminododecanoic acid.To improve our understanding of the
structure-activity relationship of KES23458, 200-ns MD simula-
tions were carried out whereby /H9252-alanine and 12-aminodode-
canoic acid were separately docked in the active site of the enzyme
in an external aldimine conformation. The substrates were man-

ually orientated in the active site, using the electron density from
PLP= as a guide and consistent with other transaminase structures,
with the aromatic nitrogen of the PLP moiety in close proximity to
Asp
259. The simulations were carried out under identical condi-
tions in order to compare changes in protein conformation and
substrate binding (as described in Materials and Methods). Back-
bone RMSD analysis was performed to determine the equilibra-
tion time of the system and this was discarded from analysis (see
Fig. S7 and further descriptions of materials and methods in the
supplemental material).
Analysis of the MD simulation results exempliﬁed the plastic-
ity of the active site of KES23458. The average backbone RMSD for
each residue was calculated over 150 ns in each system. The aver-
age value for each residue was then compared between the two
systems, and the largest observed changes (/H110221.5 Å) were mapped
onto the original crystal structure (
Fig. 3, top diagram). Thirty-
one residues were identiﬁed whose average backbone RMSD was
/H110221.5 Å different between the two simulations, i.e., these 31 resi-
dues showed the biggest differences in position when binding one
substrate or the other. While the residues were largely located

around the PLP binding sites, loops around the entrance to the
active site, as well as distant loops on the surface of the protein
were also observed to adopt different conformations depending
on the substrate bound in the system. It was also observed that
many of the conformational changes observed (19 of 31) were in
the active site of the monomer which contained PLP but no sub-
strate.
On closer examination of the 12-aminododecanoic acid simu-
lation, signiﬁcant structural rearrangements were apparent, with
notable movements from hydrophobic residues, including Phe
24,
Phe89=, Iso166, and Asn169 (1.4- to 3.5-Å differences in RMSD be-
tween the two simulations) which combined with others to form a
large surface around the substrate. These movements also acted to
shield the substrate from more polar residues, such as Tyr
153 and
Arg414 (0.8- and 2.6-Å difference in RMSD, respectively), which
rotated away from the active site (Fig. 3, bottom left and right
diagrams). Toward the carboxylate end of the substrate, close to
the surface of the protein, the active site expands and the substrate
appears to move randomly in the solvent-accessible space. Based
on the crystal structure, it was initially anticipated that Lys
171 may
form a hydrogen bond with the/H9251-carboxylic acid terminus of the
substrate, and although this loop did undergo signiﬁcant confor-
mational changes, analysis revealed that this bond was only inter-
mittently formed and no stable interactions were observed be-
tween the substrate carboxylic acid and the protein. In contrast, in
the /H9252-alanine system, Arg
414 appeared to be catalytically relevant,
as it was ideally positioned to stabilize the carboxylate terminus of
/H9252-alanine through a stable electrostatic interaction (Fig. 3, bottom
right). This interaction positions the substrate ideally for aldimine
formation with PLP and would improve subsequent stabilization
of the aldimine intermediate in the active site. This supports the
observation that/H9252-alanine activity is signiﬁcantly higher than that
of 12-aminododecanoic acid, as well as the notion that the active
site evolved toward/H9252-alanine catalysis. Alignment of the structure
of KES23458 with other known/H9275-transaminases (PDB accession
numbers
3A8U, 3FCR, and3I5T) revealed that Arg414 aligns with
Arg417 from other structures, the so-called “ﬂipping arginine,”
responsible for dual-substrate speciﬁcity (45). To further eluci-
date the role of Arg414, the residue was subjected to saturation
mutagenesis. An NDT codon library which encoded 12 possible
amino acids was generated, and 35 transformants were screened
(/H1102295% coverage) for activity with 12-aminododecanoic acid. All
transformants exhibiting transaminase activity were recovered
and DNA was sequenced, and in each case it was found that the
protein contained an arginine residue at position 414 exclusively.
A number of transformants containing inactive variants were also
sequenced and were found to have an Arg
414 replaced with Ile
(ATT), Val (GTT), Gly (GGT), or Asp (GAT) residues. In addi-
tion, Arg414Lys (AAA codon) was also created, as this was not
encoded by the NDT codon but was essential to probe the func-
tion of Arg414. The ﬁve variants were individually overexpressed
and puriﬁed in the same manner as the WT protein and tested
against a small number of additional substrates (/H9252-alanine, 1,3-
diaminopropane, putrescine, and cadaverine). Diamines were
tested in order to determine whether a reversal in the charge at
residue 414 (Arg
414Asp) could be paired with a reversed charge in
the substrate (carboxylic acid to amine), and longer-chain amines
were tested to account for the size difference between arginine and
aspartic acid. All ﬁve variants were successfully puriﬁed, but activ-
ity was only detectable for the Arg
414Lys variant, which retained
activity against all of the substrates tested except 12-aminodode-
canoic acid. In each case Arg414Lys activity was signiﬁcantly lower
than in the WT enzyme (/H1102120%) (Table 2).
These ﬁndings are in agreement with previous reports in the
literature and indicate that Arg414 acts as a “ﬂipping arginine” in
KES23458. A positively charged group at position 414 is essential
for catalysis with Arg414, which is strongly favored at this position.
Although replacement with a lysine yielded a functional mutant,
activity was greatly reduced for/H9252-alanine (19.9% relative to WT
KES23458), and activities with other substrates were impacted
more signiﬁcantly (
Table 2).
Conclusions. KES23458 was previously identiﬁed as a pro-
spective industrial biocatalyst because of its ability to metabolize
12-aminododecanoic acid. The subsequent analyses presented
here demonstrate that KES23458 is a highly promiscuous transami-
nase,catalyzing amine transfers with 39 of the 50 substrates tested.
Although this broad substrate range can be partially rationalized
due to the sheer size of the substrate binding pocket, molecular
dynamics simulations indicated that the enzyme is able to un-
dergo signiﬁcant structural rearrangements to accommodate dif-
ferent substrates. As is the case for the/H9275-transaminase family gen-
erally, the structure-function relationship of KES23458 is poorly
understood, and consequently, there are few examples of ratio-
nally designed /H9275-transaminase variants with signiﬁcantly im-
proved activity toward nonphysiological substrates (
8, 16, 46).

additional investigations into the concomitant dehydrogenase
(KES23460) from the bicistronic operon containing KES23458
were carried out, and a physiological role for the transaminase was
conﬁrmed. In contrast to the transaminase, the dehydrogenase
enzyme was highly selective toward malonate semialdehyde, sug-
gesting that the transaminase in fact has a specialized function
within a /H9252-alanine catabolic pathway inPseudomonas sp. strain
AAC. The dehydrogenase was also observed to facilitate both
CoA-dependent and -independent reactions, in agreement with
previous literature ﬁndings, although superior rates were ob-
served for the CoA-dependent pathway to produce acetyl-CoA.
Notwithstanding the current limitations for rational engineer-
ing of KES23458, the thorough characterization of the enzyme,
including an understanding of its apparent specialization toward
/H9252-alanine, together with its broader characterization and a high-
resolution crystal structure (
Table 3), make it an excellent candi-
date for biocatalyst development. KES23458 shows broad activity
for a range of industrially relevant amines and/H9275-amino acids, all
of which are important precursors in polyamide production.
