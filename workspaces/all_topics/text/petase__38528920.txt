Introduction
Plastic, rst introduced in the mid-20th century, has been
essential to contemporary civilization due to its convenience
and cost-e ﬀectiveness. Nevertheless, its extensive use has
resulted in notable diﬃculties in waste management.
1 Projec-
tions indicate that the worldwide output of plastic might exceed
8.3 billion tons, possibly leading to a concerning 12 billion tons
of garbage by the year 2050.
2 The buildup of waste in landlls
and natural ecosystems poses signicant environmental issues.
The prevailing pattern highlights the need for sustainable
solutions, given that conventional approaches such as recycling
and burning have shown their insu ﬃciency, resulting in
a substantial buildup of plastic trash in landlls.
3 The magni-
tude of plastic manufacturing, coupled with inadequate waste
disposal methods, has resulted in the pervasive presence of
plastic trash and subsequent environmental pollution caused
by microplastics, which are formed as a consequence of the
degradation of larger plastic objects.
3,4 These present substan-
tial hazards to ecosystems, human well-being, and safety.5,6 The
increasing recognition of this ecological problem emphasizes
the pressing need for eﬀective degradation remedies.
The widespread manufacturing and disposal of plastics have
resulted in substantial contamination in land, water, and air
environments, with microplastics being especially abundant.
Inadequate waste management on land is a signicant cause of
marine plastic pollution, leading to an estimated 5.25 trillion
microplastics and nanoplastics entering seas, soil, and air.
7 The
presence of these minuscule particles is worrisome because of
their detrimental impact on soil fertility and the well-being of
marine organisms. Microplastics and nanoplastics have
a profound negative impact on ecosystems and the health of
species. They disrupt natural processes, damage animals, and
accumulate toxic compounds in their organs.

microplastics has the potential to aﬀect the capacity of soil to

allow water to pass through, its density, and the movement of
nutrients, which raises worries about the consequences of their
presence.
9,10 The entrance of micro- and nanoplastics into
oceans is inuenced by several processes, including UV photo-
degradation, mechanical forces, hydrolysis, and biological
degradation.
11,12 These minuscule particles disperse extensively
across the ocean environment and have a notable inuence on
marine life and ecosystems. Due to their diminutive size, they
can eﬀortlessly inltrate organisms and accumulate inside their
organs, resulting in the accumulation of detrimental
compounds that cause signicant hazards to marine life.
13
The widespread use of articial polymers, which are crucial
in contemporary society, has reached concerning levels and
poses substantial ecological and physiological hazards in
terrestrial, aquatic, and marine ecosystems. Due to their small
size and large surface area, microplastics are very susceptible to
absorbing harmful compounds including heavy metals, medi-
cines, andame retardants.
14 Additionally, they are more easily
consumed by living creatures. These activities result in a range
of negative consequences for plants and animals, such as
alterations in soil composition, increased growth of microor-
ganisms, inammation insh, compromised immune systems,
reproductive problems, and malfunction in organs.
15–19 The
heightened vulnerability of humans makes them particularly
susceptible to the substantial risk posed by microplastic
pollution. The pollutants have the ability to initiate inamma-
tory and neurotoxic eﬀects by activating certain protein kinase
pathways. The eﬀects of microplastics among various creatures
diﬀer depending on their ability to withstand environmental
stress and the ecological circumstances in which they live.
20,21
The extensive use of these polymers and their inclination to
amass contaminants emphasize the need for devising eﬃcient
degrading techniques. The aim of these techniques is to
disassemble microplastics and reduce their presence in the
environment and alleviate the harm they cause (Scheme 1).
Plastics including polyethylene (PE), polyethylene tere-
phthalate (PET), polyurethane (PU), polystyrene (PS), poly-
propylene (PP), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) have notable
environmental diﬃculties since they degrade slowly in nature.
22
The degradation pathways of these polymers may be classied
according to their chemical composition: those with a carbon–
carbon backbone and those with heteroatoms in the main
chain.23,24 The focus of this review is on the methodologies used
by microorganisms to degrade synthetic polymers and the

specic roles of various enzymes in this biological process.
These technologies provide eﬀective methods for transforming
plastic trash into carbon atoms, carbon dioxide, and valuable
chemicals. The use of enzyme technology is crucial in
promoting environmental conservation by converting plastic
waste into less detrimental compounds.
25 This review will
explore the most recent developments in enzymatic degradation
techniques and assess their potential in reducing the environ-
mental and health consequences of plastic pollution, with
a specic emphasis on microplastics and nanoplastics.
The longevity and obstacles of
synthetic polymers in the environment
Enzymatic degradation challenges and progress in common
synthetic polymers
The extensive use of synthetic polymers such as PET, PE, PS, PP,
and PVC has played a substantial role in the global surge of
plastic production, which reached a staggering 335 million tons
in 2016.
26 These materials, which are used in numerous
industries, present signicant environmental obstacles because
of their long-lasting and non-degradable characteristics.4 The
increasing use of these polymers in our everyday lives calls for
a careful evaluation of their environmental consequences,
specically in terms of energy usage and waste production.
27
This situation has prompted a greater focus on the development
of sustainable alternatives and recycling methods. The pressing
concern lies innding innovative solutions that can mitigate
the adverse eﬀects of plastic proliferation, while maintaining
a balance between the utility of these polymers and their envi-
ronmental footprint.
The conversation surrounding the use of synthetic polymers
revolves around their essential role in contemporary society and
the resulting environmental hurdles. There are ongoing eﬀorts
to investigate environmentally friendly materials and improve
recycling methods, but these endeavors encounter various
obstacles, such as technological constraints and economic
viability.
28 The management of synthetic polymers' impact on
the environment is a multifaceted challenge that necessitates
a comprehensive approach.
Polyethylene (PE)
Dealing with polyethylene poses a serious challenge for
enzymes when it comes to breaking down microplastics. This
material is oen used in packaging and containers because of
its outstanding ability to resist microbial degradation. PE,
especially HDPE, possesses a linear structure that enhances its
resistance to enzymatic degradation. Exciting advancements in
biotechnology have revealed the incredible capabilities of
specic enzymes and microbial strains in eﬀectively binding to
and breaking down PE.
29–31 Usually, these enzymes work by
oxidizing the polymer chains, initiating a process of breaking
them apart.32 Several environmental factors, such as exposure to
UV light or physical abrasion, can contribute to this process.33
These factors enhance the surface area to promote enzymatic
activity.
Polyethylene terephthalate (PETE/PET)
Extensive research has been conducted on the enzymatic
degradation of PET, which is commonly found in beverage
bottles and textiles. Researchers have made notable discoveries
in the area of enzyme research and revealed the impressive
capabilities of enzymes such as PETase and MHETase in eﬃ-
ciently breaking down PET into its fundamental components,
ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid.
34–36 These enzymes have
been found in certain bacteria and fungi and their eﬃciency
and longevity are being enhanced for industrial use.37–39 The
potential of enzymatic degradation of PET for recycling opera-
tions is immense and oﬀers a more environmentally friendly
and eﬃcient option compared to traditional mechanical and
chemical recycling methods (Fig. 1).
Polypropylene (PP)
PP is widely used in packaging and automotive components due
to its impressive resistance to a range of chemical degradation
processes.
40,41 However, a recent study has uncovered the
potential of enzymatic techniques in degrading PP. Certain
microbial strains have been acknowledged for their remarkable
capacity to adhere to and partially degrade PP.
42,43 The challenge
is to enhance the eﬃciency of these biological processes to
make them more practical for widespread use. A study is being
conducted to explore and improve enzymes that have the
potential to enhance the e ﬃciency of breaking down the
chemical bonds in PP.
44
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC)
PVC, widely used in the construction and packaging industries,
poses challenges for biodegradation because of its chlorine
content.
45 There is a lack of comprehensive scientic knowledge
regarding the enzymatic degradation of PVC, especially when

ganisms inhabiting various surfaces of microplastics release various
types of extracellular enzymes for biodegradation and fragmentation.

compared to other polymers. There has been a strong focus on
identifying and managing microbial strains that can tolerate
and break down the chlorine-based compounds commonly
found in PVC.
46,47 The study in this area is still in its initial
phases with the goal of developing dependable and eﬀective
methods for the secure breakdown of PVC.
Polystyrene (PS)
PS, a widely used material in packaging and insulation, is well-
known for its remarkable durability due to its chemically stable
aromatic structure.
48,49 However, recent discoveries have
revealed the presence of certain bacteria and fungi that can
degrade PS using specialized enzymes.
50–52 The enzymes eﬀec-
tively break down the styrene monomers, and the current pace
and eﬃciency of the process meets expectations.53 The present
study aims to enhance the eﬃciency and longevity of these
enzymes to make the biodegradation of PS a more practical
option.
Polylactic acid (PLA)
PLA, a bioplastic derived from renewable sources, is inherently
more prone to enzymatic degradation when compared to poly-
mers made from petroleum.
54 Research has shown that certain
enzymes, such as proteinase K and lipase, have proven to be
extremely eﬃcient in the degradation of PLA.
55–57 The degrada-
tion of PLA happens through the hydrolysis of ester bonds,
leading to the formation of lactic acid, which can be subse-
quently metabolized by various microorganisms.58 PLA stands
out for its positive environmental impact since it can be easily
and completely broken down in composting facilities.
Polybutylene succinate (PBS)
It has been observed that PBS, a type of biodegradable plastic, is
more susceptible to enzymatic degradation compared to
conventional polymers.
2,59 There have been signicant ndings
in theeld of enzyme research, particularly in the area of PBS
degradation.60,61 Notably, lipases have demonstrated remark-
able eﬃciency in breaking down PBS. The degradation process
involves the hydrolysis of ester bonds in the polymer, causing it
to break down into smaller particles that can be easily broken
down by biological processes.
62 Because of its remarkable
vulnerability to degradation, PBS is an extremely appealing
material for endeavors that prioritize ecological sustainability.
Polyurethane (PUR)
Enzymatic degradation of PUR can be quite complex due to its
various chemical compositions.
63,64 However, certain enzymes
such as esterase and ureases show great potential in breaking
down PUR.
28,65,66 The enzymes have the ability to specically
target certain bonds in the PUR polymer, resulting in its
degradation.28 Researchers in thiseld are focused on uncov-
ering and enhancing the eﬃciency of these enzymes with the
goal of developing eﬀective techniques for breaking down PURs.
The signicance of this issue stems from the widespread use
and persistent presence of PURs in the environment.
Inuence of chemical composition on plastic degradation
dynamics
The dynamics of plastic degradation are closely connected to
various internal and external factors, particularly in relation to
enzymatic activity on microplastics.
67–69 These factors encom-
pass the intrinsic characteristics of the plastic, such as its
molecular structure, composition, physical form, and the
inclusion of additives.
23,70,71 The rate and mechanism of
biodegradation are greatly inuenced by these characteristics.
Note that the susceptibility of a plastic to enzymatic attack can
be signicantly aﬀected by the presence of specic functional
groups or the degree of polymer branching.
Factors such as pH, temperature, oxygen levels, and light
exposure are critical in inuencing the eﬀectiveness of enzy-
matic degradation. Certain enzymes exhibit improved perfor-
mance or durability in particular environmental conditions,
which can impact the rate of degradation.
72–75 Environmental
factors can also weaken the structure of plastics, making them
more susceptible to enzymatic breakdown.
The fundamental chemical composition of plastics, speci-
cally the types of bonds they possess, plays a crucial role in
determining their degradability. Plastics with carbon–carbon
(C–C) backbones, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, have
a remarkable ability to resist microbial and enzymatic decom-
position, which signi cantly slows down the degradation
process.
76 On the other hand, polymers that incorporate
heteroatoms into their main chain, such as polyesters, are
highly prone to enzymatic hydrolysis.
77
The interaction between degrading enzymes and a plastic is
greatly inuenced by the chemical composition, which deter-
mines the surface hydrophobicity. Surfaces that repel water can
also cause hydrophilic enzymes to be repelled, which presents
initial obstacles in the biodegradation process. Eﬀective enzy-
matic binding and action o en require the formation of
a biolm.78,79
Given the origin of most modern plastics from petrochem-
ical sources, the widespread existence of non-biodegradable
plastics presents a notable environmental concern.
13 To tackle
this problem, it is important to keep working on improving our
understanding andnding ways to enhance the degradation of
microplastics by enzymes. Adapting enzymatic methods to
eﬀectively tackle the distinct obstacles posed by various plastic
polymers is needed for advancing sustainable waste manage-
ment and environmental conservation strategies.
Examining the enduring environmental eﬀects of
microplastics and nanoplastics
It is essential to have a comprehensive understanding of the
physical characteristics and long-term eﬀects of microplastics
(MPs) and nanoplastics (NPs) in order to eﬀectively tackle the
ongoing issue of these pollutants in various ecosystems. The
extensive variety of synthetic polymers used in the composition
of MPs results in a wide range of physical forms, including
foam, pellets, akes, bers, and lms. It is important to note
that a signicant portion of these particles, approximately 60%,
are smaller than 1 mm in size, primarily appearing asakes and

bers.80–84 Nanoplastics possess distinct characteristics in
comparison to MPs as a result of their reduced dimensions. The
diﬀerence in size has a notable impact on their movement,
behavior in the environment, interactions, availability to
organisms, and potential harm.
85–88
Both industrial and residential activities contribute to the
release of these pollutants, leading to the contamination of
aquatic systems, air, and soil.
89–91 The widespread pollution
poses considerable threats to multiple aspects of the ecosystem,
such as the food chain, plant life, marine organisms, and
human populations.92,93 This pollution greatly a ﬀects both
humans and the environment, as they both experience the
consequences of it. The structural composition of polymers
plays a key role in determining their environmental behavior
and has a combination of ordered and disordered regions that
have a signicant impact.
23 The current situation underscores
the need for eﬀective methods to address these persistent
pollutants.
Exploring the ecological and health implications of
microplastic and nanoplastic pollution
The presence of MPs and NPs in diﬀerent ecosystems, whether
due to natural processes such as erosion or human activities
such as industrial emissions, results in a wide range of harmful
consequences.
94–96 These particles have been associated with
serious health risks, such as the potential to cause cancer and
interfere with endocrine systems.
97,98 Their environmental
impact is exacerbated by their capacity to attract and transport
other detrimental substances, including persistent organic
pollutants and heavy metals.
99,100 In addition, MPs and NPs can
carry harmful bacteria, including antibiotic-resistant strains,
which poses a considerable threat to both wildlife and human
communities.
The management and regulation of MPs and NPs require
advanced analytical and quantitative methods, particularly
when addressing complex environmental matrices. The chal-
lenge is made more diﬃcult by the complexity of recycling these
particles.
101 A deep understanding of the physical and chemical
properties of MPs and NPs is needed to develop eﬀective strat-
egies for their enzymatic degradation.
In order to eﬀectively tackle the negative impacts of MPs and
NPs, it is important to acknowledge their wide-ranging impli-
cations and establish dependable approaches for their identi-
cation, assessment, and breakdown. Thiseld of study not
only provides potential solutions for addressing the environ-
mental and health risks linked to microplastic and nanoplastic
pollution, but also emphasizes the importance of ongoing
eﬀorts to comprehend and combat this widespread problem.
The role of microbes in plastic
degradation
The crucial role of microorganisms in plastic degradation
As we strive tond sustainable and environmentally friendly
solutions to the problem of plastic pollution, the importance of
microorganisms in breaking down microplastics (MPs) and
nanoplastics (NPs) has become a signicant focus.
102–106 This
area of study investigates the capacity of diﬀerent microorgan-
isms and insects to transform plastic into eco-friendly
substances.
92,93 Several microorganisms, such as bacteria,
fungi, and actinomycetes, have been recognized for their enzy-
matic capability to degrade the intricate chemical bonds of
microplastics into simpler compounds.
107–109
These microorganisms, found in various habitats such as
soil, aquatic environments, and even air, have an important role
in the natural breakdown of organic matter. An excellent illus-
tration is the breakdown of PE, a commonly used plastic, by
a range of microorganisms.
29,31 One of the most fascinating
ndings in this eld involves the gut bacteria found in the
larvae of the large waxworm, Galleria mellonella.110,111 These
bacteria have demonstrated impressive e ﬀectiveness in
breaking down PE through a process known as hydrolysis.112
This research on the interaction between microbes and
plastic has uncovered exciting possibilities for addressing
plastic waste. It has the potential to transform discarded
petroleum-based polymers into reusable materials or feedstock
for biomass production, and oﬀers new ways to manage plastic
waste eﬀectively.
24,113 The success of these groundbreaking
solutions depends on a comprehensive grasp of the distinct
microbial enzymes implicated in the degradation process. A
deep understanding of this subject is crucial to create more
eﬃcient and sustainable approaches to tackle the growing issue
of plastic pollution and advance the eld of enzyme-based
microplastic degradation.
Dynamics of the microbial degradation of plastics
The breakdown of microplastics (MPs) by microorganisms is
a sophisticated process driven by enzymes. Many factors can
inuence the process, including the molecular weight and
chemical composition of the microplastic, environmental
conditions, the specic microbial species, and the physical
properties of the plastic, such as crystallinity and the presence
of functional groups or additives.
8,9 The degradation process
usually occurs in a sequence of stages beginning with the
development of a biolm on the surface of the plastic. This is
then followed by biodegradation, biotransformation, andnally
mineralization.
35,114 Irrespective of the natural degradability of
the polymer, the rst step involves hydrolysis, which breaks
down microplastics into smaller molecular fragments. This step
is crucial and relies on the microorganisms at hand (Fig. 2).
Microorganisms play a key role in the intricate biochemical
reactions that occur during the aerobic biodegradation of
plastics. Microorganisms use oxidizing enzymes to generate
carbonyl groups, which are subsequently oxidized into carbox-
ylic acids.
115 This results in the hydrolysis of the polymer chain,
which facilitates degradation. The microorganisms metabolize
the small hydrocarbon fragments produced in a highly eﬃcient
manner.
116 The last step involves converting the hydrolysis
products into microbial biomass, resulting in the release of
water and carbon dioxide.93,117 The enzymes involved in this
degradation process can be classied into two main categories:
those that alter the surface of microplastics to enhance their

solubility in water, and those that break down the plastic into
smaller components for microbial metabolism.118
An understanding of the intricate processes involved in the
breakdown of microplastics by microorganisms is needed to
devise successful approaches to minimize the negative eﬀects of
microplastic pollution on the environment. It is also crucial for
making progress in enzyme-based techniques for microplastic
degradation and gaining valuable insights into potential solu-
tions for this urgent environmental issue (Table 1).
Determinants of microbial eﬃcacy in plastic degradation
The degradation process of microplastics is in uenced by
a variety of factors including microbial growth kinetics, the
properties of microplastics themselves, and the environmental
conditions at hand. The structural properties of microplastics,
their material composition, shape, and the presence of addi-
tives play a main role in determining their vulnerability to
biodegradation.
External environmental factors, including pH levels,
temperature, oxygen availability, exposure to light, and the
presence of other substances, are crucial in inuencing the
process. The interaction between temperature and pH is key
since pH levels have a signicant impact on the electrostatic
interactions between the microplastic surface and microor-
ganisms and chemicals in soil or water.
130 Degradation can be
slowed down under certain conditions, while enzyme activity
may be a ﬀected in di ﬀerent environments. For the most
eﬀective biological degradation of microplastics, it is important
to maintain optimal conditions such as low pH levels and low
temperatures. The rate of degradation can be inuenced by
a range of chemical and physical properties of microplastics,
including density, molecular weight, degree of crystallinity, and
the presence of specic functional groups or substituents.
131
Microplastics with carbon –carbon (C –C) bonds provide
enhanced durability against microbial attack, whereas micro-
plastics with ester bonds are more prone to the e ﬀects of
hydrolytic enzymes.
116
The inclusion of plasticizers or other additives can greatly
aﬀect the biodegradability of microplastics. These additives
have the potential to either enhance or impede microbial
colonization depending on their unique characteristics and
the composition of the microbial community they are target-
ing.
116 The presence of external substances on the surface of
microplastics can slow microbial degradation. On the other
hand, nutritional supplements that are high in carbon and
nitrogen can enhance the growth of microorganisms on
microplastic surfaces, thereby speeding up the degradation
process.
131 These diﬀerent factors are important in the devel-
opment of enzyme-based approaches for eﬃcient microplastic
degradation (Fig. 3).
Evaluating the eﬀectiveness and challenges of biological
plastic degradation
Progress in the degradation of plastics by microorganisms,
particularly with enzyme-based methods, has been impressive.
Biocatalysts have demonstrated signi cant potential in
breaking down microplastics (MP) into smaller particles such as
nanoplastics (NP). There is increasing interest in these bio-
catalysts due to their ability to greatly decrease the size of plastic
particles. Nevertheless, the e ﬃciency of microorganisms in
degrading plastics is inuenced by the various characteristics of
the materials and is contingent upon the size of the plastic
particles, ranging from larger akes to minuscule
dimensions.
134
Several biodegradation methods are currently under inves-
tigation, such as pure bacterial cultures, fungal cultures,
bacterial consortia, and the use of specic enzymes.
135 Micro-
organisms such as bacteria, fungi, and algae have shown the
ability to break down complex plastic polymer chains into
smaller units, or monomers.
136,137 This ability is derived from
the production of certain enzymes or metabolites that aid in the
degradation process. One of the di ﬃculties of microbial
degradation is the considerable amount of time needed to break
down contaminants. Even with the demonstrated eﬃcacy of
bacteria, the process of breaking down microplastics can be
time-consuming in certain instances and oen takes several
months. Eﬀorts are currently being made to enhance environ-
mental conditions and optimize microbial strains to accelerate
the degradation process and improve the eﬃciency of bacterial
action on MPs and NPs. In light of the diﬃculties posed by
degradation rates, there are continuous endeavors to investi-
gate the thorough biodegradation of microplastics and
nanoplastics.

Approaches for plastic degradation
using enzymes
The crucial role of microorganisms in plastic degradation
The issue of plastic pollution has become more pressing, and
the development of creative and environmentally friendly
solutions, particularly in the area of plastic degradation, is
needed. Enzymatic methods for plastic degradation have
become increasingly recognized as very e ﬀective and eco-
friendly alternatives to traditional plastic treatment methods.
This strategy, grounded in a commitment to environmental
sustainability, oﬀers a way to transform plastics into reusable
monomers or create valuable bioproducts by converting them
into carbon dioxide, water, and new biomass.
138,139
Microorganisms are crucial in this process since they produce
specialized enzymes that can eﬀectively break down polymers and
support the metabolism of the resulting hydrolyzates. The enzy-
matic biodegradation of polymers usually involves important
reactions such as hydrolysis and oxidation, which break down
polymer chains into smaller oligomers and monomers.
140,141These
reactions are essential for the breakdown of various polymer
bonds, such as ester, carbonate, amide, and glycoside bonds,
resulting in the creation of monomers. In terms of their suscep-
tibility to enzymatic degradation, petroleum-based polymers can
be categorized into two types: hydrolyzable and non-hydrolyzable.
Examples of hydrolyzable polymers include polyethylene tere-
phthalate (PET) and polyurethane (PUR), while non-hydrolyzable
polymers include polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), poly-
propylene (PP), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC).
141,142 Enzymes from
the hydrolytic enzyme group, including esterases, lipases, depoly-
merizers, and fetases, have a high prociency in breaking down
the carbon structure of plastics. They focus on the ester bonds and
carbonyl carbon atoms that are created when the oxidation process
occurs, transforming the polymer into individual monomers.
143
Nevertheless, the degradation of non-hydrolyzable polymers
such as PE, PS, PP, and PVC poses a considerable obstacle. The
chemical degradation of the carbon backbone is a complex area
that still requires further research. Ongoing progress in enzy-
matic degradation is needed to preserve the environment and
improve recycling techniques.
Enzyme specicity in plastic polymer degradation
In the area of enzyme-mediated microplastic degradation, past
research has revealed the involvement of numerous microor-
ganisms and enzymes in the breakdown of polyethylene (PE).
These organisms, such as actinomycetes, bacteria, and fungi,
play distinct roles in the degradation of PE.

Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Trametes versicolor , and
alkane hydrolase fromPseudomonas species (Fig. 4).145–147
The degradation mechanisms for various forms of PE,
including LDPE and HDPE, are c urrently being studied.
Enzymes like laccase and alkane hydrolases have demon-
strated potential in initiating PE degradation. Laccase, in
particular, aids in oxidizing the PE surface and creating
carbonyl regions that are more prone to subsequent enzymatic
activity. Alkane hydrolases have shown great e ﬃcacy in
breaking down heat-treated PE.
135,148–151 Enzymes involved in
PE degradation have been isolated from a wide range of
microbial sources, including Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and
Actinobacteria. These microorganisms have shown promise in
aiding the breakdown of microplastics. However, there is still
much to learn about the exact process by which these enzymes
degrade microplastics, and further research is needed.
152
Furthermore, there have been notable advancements in the
eld of microbial enzymes that possess the ability to break
down lignin polymers containing oxidative C –Cb o n d s .
Notable examples include manganese peroxidase, lignin
peroxidase, and laccase. The understanding of these enzymes
in the area of polyethylene biodegradation is continuously
developing, and additional research is necessary to gain
a complete grasp of their functions and mechanisms. It is
important that future studi es focus on gaining a deeper
understanding and characterization of the diﬀerent enzymes
involved in polyethylene degradation.

Focused enzymatic activity targeting polyethylene
terephthalate
The eld of enzymatic microplastic degradation has made
signicant progress, especially in targeting polyethylene tere-
phthalate (PET). This is based on extensive research onTher-
mobida fusca hydrolase, which has led to the discovery of
various enzymes that can break down PET. Out of all the
enzymes, the PETase enzyme fromIdeonella sakaiensis201-F6 is
particularly
142 noteworthy for its impressive capacity to eﬀec-
tively degrade PET into various intermediates such as BHET,
MHET, and TPA. MHETase, an additional enzyme, carries out
further processing of MHET to produce terephthalic acid and
ethylene glycol.
34,155
Recent advancements have resulted in the creation of
stronger versions of PETase, which have improved stability and
eﬃciency in breaking down materials. In addition, a 25 kDa
suberinase from Streptomyces scabies has demonstrated
considerable potential in the degradation of PET.
156,157 Thor-
ough analyses of the structure and mechanisms have uncovered
distinct interactions between PETase, cutinase, and PET, which
occur through an inducedt mechanism. PETase is capable of
breaking down a wide range of polycyclic aromatic micro-
plastics due to its impressive versatility.
158,159
Eﬀorts to enhance the eﬃciency of PETase have involved
various techniques such as mutagenesis, overexpression, and
the use of microalgae for transformation. These advancements
are crucial in tackling the environmental issues caused by PET
pollution. This research is a signicant advancement in devel-
oping enzymatic methods to e ﬀectively break down PET
microplastics and makes a valuable contribution to environ-
mental remediation endeavors.

Enzymatic strategies for polystyrene degradation
Important advancements have been made in theeld of enzy-
matic microplastic degradation, with a particular focus on
polystyrene (PS). Progress in thiseld is evident from the fact
that a wide range of microorganisms, such as bacteria and
fungi, have the ability to break down PS. Nevertheless, the
precise enzymes responsible for initiating this degradation
process remain to be fully understood.
135,162
Prior research has emphasized the signicance of extracel-
lular esterases fromLentinus tigrinusin the breakdown of PS. It
has also mentioned that polymerases fromBacillus and Pseu-
domonas species play a role in the breakdown of PS.163,164 In
addition, there have been reports on enzymes that are involved
in breaking down styrene, such as styrene monooxygenase,
styrene oxide isomerase, phenylacetaldehydrogenase, and phe-
nylacetyl coenzyme A ligase.
165–169 These enzymes are essential
for the conversion of PS polymers through a series of reactions.
It starts with the transformation of monomers into styrene,
followed by oxidation to phenylacetate, and ultimately the
integration of phenylacetate into the Krebs cycle.
170
An in-depth knowledge and thorough analysis of these
enzymes is essential to enhance the enzymatic breakdown of PS
microplastics. This research explores new possibilities for
tackling the environmental issues caused by PS waste and oﬀers
creative and eco-friendly solutions for managing PS waste.
Eﬀorts to identify and optimize these enzymes are needed to
develop e ﬀective strategies to address the impacts of PS
pollution.
Advancing enzyme engineering for plastic degradation
Strategies for enhancing stability and eﬃcacy of enzymes in
plastic degradation. Advances in enzyme engineering are neces-
sary to eﬀectively break down microplastics. An important aspect
in this eld is to enhance the stability and activity of enzymes,
especially those involved in breaking down plastic materials.
171
This entails leveraging structural similarities between various
enzymes to enhance their functional properties, typically with the
application of site-directed mutagenesis techniques.172
Another important development involves enhancing the heat
tolerance of enzymes that target plastics. This is particularly
important for plastics with high glass transition temperatures
(T
g), as their crystallinity decreases as the temperature rises.173
This can make it easier for enzymes to access the plastics and
speed up degradation. Plastics are easier to process by enzymes
when they become moreexible and mobile at temperatures
near or above theirTg.173 Nevertheless, a serious challenge arises
when it comes to naturally occurring enzymes such as PETase
since they tend to lose their eﬃciency when exposed to high
temperatures, which restricts their ability to maintain thermal
stability.
174 To tackle this problem, previous studies have
primarily concentrated on developing di ﬀerent versions of
PETase and similar enzymes that possess the ability to endure
elevated temperatures, thus aligning with theTg of various types
of plastics. This requires a thorough examination of the
distinctive characteristics of thermophilic proteins and using
this knowledge to enhance the ability of plastic-degrading
enzymes to withstand high temperatures. The ultimate objec-
tive is to maximize the eﬃciency of these enzymes, particularly
in environments that closely align with theT
g of the specic
plastic being targeted.13,122
With the development of enhanced enzymes, we can create
enzymes with greater power and eﬃciency that enables them to
break down a wider variety of plastics. Enhancement of the
thermal stability and pH tolerance of these enzymes has the
potential to signicantly improve their practicality in environ-
mental cleanup and recycling processes. Continual endeavors in
enzyme engineering focus on surpassing the constraints of natural
enzymes, while also customizing enzymes to fullp r e c i s en e e d s
for plastic degradation.
175 Our work involves enhancing enzymes to
target specic types of plastics, enhancing their selectivity, and
maximizing their catalytic eﬃciency. The improvement of the

enzyme-based microplastic degradation.
Enhancing enzymatic thermal stability through the use of
disulde bonds for microplastic degradation
The enhancement of enzyme thermal stability has become a key
method in enzymatic microplastic degradation, particularly in the
area of PET hydrolysis. One eﬀective approach involves incorpo-
rating disulde bonds and salt bridges. This process requires
meticulous adjustment of the protein structure at specicl o c a -
tions or in its overall arrangement. As an illustration, the
replacement of amino acid residues in metal-binding regions with
disulde bonds has been demonstrated to greatly improve the
ability of enzymes to withstand high temperatures.
176
The signicance of disulde bridges is especially notable in
PET hydrolases, which possess numerous sites for binding diva-
lent metals, as evidenced by the crystal structure of the Cut190

enhancing the thermal stability of the enzyme and optimizing its
temperature range for operation. Methods such as circular
dichroism (CD) have shown that the melting temperature of the
enzyme is signicantly raised with the addition of calcium ions.
Further insights from molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and
X-ray structural analysis have uncovered the signicance of Ca
2+
binding in triggering essential conformational alterations in the
enzyme, which results in enhanced catalytic eﬃciency.122 The
presence of intramolecular disulde bridges, specically DS1 and
DS2, plays an important role in maintaining the functional
integrity of the catalytic triple bond in enzymes such as PETase.
One aspect that enhances theexibility of the loop is DS1, which
leads to a boost in enzyme activity. On the other hand, DS2 is
crucial in preserving structural stability. Focused enhancement of
these sites has been demonstrated to greatly improve the capacity

approaches to enhance their resistance to heat. As an illustration,
enzyme activity has been enhanced by replacing the divalent metal
binding site of LCC with a disulde bridge and introducing tar-
geted mutations.

the thermal stability of enzymes that play a role in breaking down
plastics, specically PET. This task requires the generation of
enzyme mutants using directed evolution techniques, as well as
the identication of optimal sites for calcium binding and disul-
de bridge formation.
The strategic use of disulde bonds is demonstrating the
enhancement of the thermal stability of enzymes employed in
the degradation of microplastics. These advancements are
crucial for the development of stronger and more eﬀective
enzymatic solutions to tackle the environmental issues caused
by plastic pollution.
Advancements in enzymatic stability through hydrogen
bonding and electrostatic interactions
Signicant progress has been achievedin enhancing the stability
of protein structures with a dedicated emphasis on hydrogen
bonding and hydrophobic interactions. The advancements in the
strategic use of proline and its surrounding residues are very
noteworthy. Prolines, known fortheir unique cyclic side chains,
have played an important role in enhancing the structural rigidity
and thermal stability of PET hydrolases.
The substitution of serine with proline in bacterial PET
hydrolases such as Est119 fromThermobida alba AHK119 and
Cut190 from Saccharomonospora viridis AHK190 results in
a notable enhancement in heat resistance and PET degradation
eﬃciency. In the same way, the incorporation of proline into
enzymes such as LCC
ICCG tetramer andThermobida albacutinase
has a notable eﬀect on their melting temperature and boosts their
hydrolytic activity toward PET. Enhancement of the hydrogen
bonding network in enzymes has been a key area of study, and
PETase is a prominent illustration of this. Modications made to
the exible regions of these enzymes have led to the development
of variants that exhibit enhanced rigidity and thermal
stability.
176,180 Notable examples include the IsPETase S121E/
D186H double variant and the ThermoPETase triple variant.
These variants exhibit higher melting temperatures and stronger
binding to PET, which enhances their suitability for industrial
applications.
181 FAST-PETase mutants, such as S132E, D186H,
R224Q, N233K, and R280A, have been found to exhibit exceptional
kinetics and performance at elevated temperatures, surpassing the
capabilities of the original enzyme in terms of hydrolysis eﬃciency.
Crystal structure analysis of these mutants has conrmed their
noteworthy contribution to enhancing the thermal stability of the
enzyme.
182
Nevertheless, challenges persist in breaking down highly
crystalline plastics, which hinders the extensive use of these
enzymes. Research has indicated that FAST-PETase can fully
break down PET aer thermal pretreatment, suggesting that
these enzymes are successful in the recycling process. 182
However, their use in the environmental degradation of crys-
talline polymers is still somewhat restricted.
Enhancing enzymatic stability with glycosylation in
microplastic degradation
Enhancement of the thermal stability of enzymes used in
microplastic degradation has gained signicant attention, and
glycosylation has emerged as a promising technique in this
regard. This process has demonstrated encouraging results in
enhancing thermal stability, particularly when used with
enzymes expressed in eukaryotic microbial cells. Under-
standing glycosylation, a crucial post-translational modica-
tion, is essential to maintain protein stability and prevent
thermal aggregation.
An excellent illustration is the PET hydrolase LCC, renowned
for its exceptional thermal stability. The expression of LCC in
Pichia pastorisled to glycosylation, which resulted in an enzyme
form that exhibits increased resistance to high-temperature
aggregation. This variant of LCC has enhanced eﬃciency in
breaking down PET at elevated temperatures.
183 Nevertheless,
achieving precise control over the glycosylation sites on the
enzyme's surface poses a serious challenge, given its potential
impact on the interaction of the enzyme with the PET substrate.
Precise positioning of these glycosylation sites is needed to
prevent negative impacts on the active site and overall func-
tionality of the enzyme. Cutting-edge computational methods,
such as GRAPE, have been employed to enhance enzymes such
as IsPETase, leading to the development of variants like Dura-
PETase. These variants exhibit a remarkable increase in melting
temperature, thereby enhancing their stability and eﬀectiveness
in degrading PET.
184
In a previously reported study, neural networks were used to
conduct extensive in silico mutagenesis and experimental vali-
dation. The aim was to develop enzymes with enhanced thermal
stability. During this study, a number of mutations were
discovered in PETase that greatly enhanced its performance in
high temperature conditions. The enzyme FAST-PETase
demonstrated a notable enhancement in the rate of hydrolysis
when compared to its original form. While it is important to
consider the potential impact on the catalytic eﬃciency of the
enzyme,
182 it is also benecial to increase thermal stability. The
function of the enzyme can be inuenced by structural modi-
cations in the active site. As an illustration, replacing Ala with
Arg280 in PETase enhances the speed of PET degradation.
Glycosylation is a crucial element in enhancing enzyme
thermal stability, and it is essential to carefully select a glyco-
sylation site that does not disrupt the catalytic activity of the
enzyme. A meticulous approach to enzyme modi cation is
needed for the advancement of enzyme-based strategies for
microplastic degradation (Fig. 5).
Enhancing microplastic degradation through improved
enzyme–substrate dynamics
The eﬀectiveness of enzyme-based microplastic degradation
relies heavily on the intricate interactions between enzymes and
their specic substrates, particularly when it comes to PET
hydrolases. This aspect is of the utmost importance in hetero-
geneous catalysis because it involves the solubility of the
enzyme in an aqueous system, which is in stark contrast to the
insolubility of the PET chains.
187,188 This imbalance frequently
results in substantial adsorption on the PET surface, which can
have a negative impact on the catalytic e ﬃciency of the
enzyme.
189 It is worth noting that the structure of PETase does

not inherently facilitate substrate binding. This discovery has
sparked a surge of scientic curiosity in hydrophobic polymers
that resemble naturally occurring substances such as
carbohydrate-active enzymes. The interaction between enzymes
and PET substrates is mainly inuenced by the electrostatic and
hydrophobic interactions among the amino acid residues.
190,191
The improvement of the interaction between enzymes and
substrates is a main area of emphasis. One eﬃcient approach is
to alter the hydrophobic surface and/or electrostatic properties
of the enzyme. Through an analysis of the charged and solvent-
exposed amino acid residues of proteins, studies are striving to
minimize the electrostatic repulsion between the PET substrate
and the enzyme surface.
121,192,193 These adjustments can
enhance the binding aﬃnity and boost the degradation eﬃ-
ciency of PET. These advancements are crucial in the develop-
ment of enzyme-based methods for microplastic degradation
and have a signicant role in reducing the environmental
impact of plastic pollution.
The enhancement of enzyme–substrate interactions is not
just a scientic endeavor, but an important aspect of promoting
environmental sustainability. Through careful optimization of
these interactions, enzymes can be customized to better target
and break down particular forms of microplastics, resulting in
the higher overall eﬃciency of the degradation process. This
approach shows immense potential in addressing the growing
concern of microplastic pollution and oﬀers a more eﬃcient
and eco-conscious solution to this worldwide problem. With the
ongoing advancements in research, the potential for developing
highly e ﬀective and specialized enzymes for microplastic
degradation is growing.
Enhancing the active site of PET hydrolase to enhance
microplastic degradation
The enzymatic degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
microplastics is intricately linked to the interaction between the
active site of PET hydrolases and the PET substrate.
194 In order
to optimize the catalytic activity of these hydrolases, it is oen
necessary to make precise modi cations in the active site
region. These modi cations may involve recon guring the
substrate, adjusting the cofactor speci city, or introducing
mutations in the active site that have been proven to greatly
aﬀect the overall reactivity.
195,196 One important objective in
PET-degrading enzyme engineering is to enhance the accessi-
bility of the active site to the plastic surface.
197 This is usually
achieved by broadening the range of substrates that can bind to
the enzyme. The approach used involved manipulatingFusa-
rium solani cutinase to create the L182A mutant. This mutant
was designed to have enhanced hydrolytic activity against PET
by making specic amino acid modications to expand the
active site niche.
198
Enzymes such as PETase, Cut190, MHETase, andPseudo-
monas aestusnigri hydrolase have employed comparable tech-
niques to selectively target residues in the substrate binding site
by means of structural mutagenesis.199 Recent modications
have signicantly enhanced the binding of PET substrate and
minimized the interference caused by degradation byproducts.
As a result, the eﬃciency of PET depolymerization has been
greatly improved.
200 Eﬀorts are currently being made to enhance
the hydrophobic characteristics of the binding site or optimize
the active site. These eﬀorts strive to enhance or diminish the
bond of substances, ultimately resulting in more eﬃcient PET
degradation.
185,198,201–203
In addition, modifying the structure of the active site of the
enzyme can assist in reducing the inhibition caused by PET
degradation intermediates or products.
204 These di ﬀerent
strategies work together to improve the interaction between PET
hydrolase and its substrate for more eﬃcient degradation of
PET. This is a signicant contribution to tackling the environ-
mental issues associated with microplastics made from PET.
The improvement of the active site of PET hydrolases is a crucial
step in the development of more eﬃcient enzymatic solutions
for microplastic degradation (Table 2).
Enhancing enzyme surface properties to enhance eﬃciency in
degrading microplastics
In the area of enzyme-based microplastic degradation,
numerous endeavors have been undertaken to enhance the
eﬃciency of plastic degradation. This involves modifying the
surface properties and charge characteristics of the active site of

RSC Advances Review
PET hydrolases. The enhancement of the hydrophobicity of the
active site has been shown to be a successful approach to
improving binding to plastic substrates and consequently
boosting degradation eﬃciency. As an illustration, when the
cutinase Cbotu_EstA is adjusted,
214 it reveals a greater portion of
its hydrophobic surface. This leads to improved adsorption to
PET substrates and an increase in hydrolytic activity. Never-
theless, an overabundance of hydrophobic residues may result
in undesirable consequences like enzyme aggregation or
structural instability.
In a previously reported study, certain mutations that greatly
improve the activity of PETase were discovered. This was ach-
ieved with the use of molecular docking and crystallographic
analysis. Several mutations, including R61A, L88F, and I179F,
have been found to greatly enhance enzyme e ﬃciency. In
a similar vein, modication of the thermostable LCC and Tf
Cut2 PET hydrolases by substituting His/Phe with Ser/Ile
enhances their ability to break down PET at lower tempera-
tures, resulting in more e ﬃcient depolymerization.
202 The
improvement of hydrophobicity can also enhance enzyme –
substrate interactions. This was observed in the PHB-degrading
enzyme fromR. pickettiiT1, where the substitution of serine and
tyrosine with hydrophobic residues increased adhesion to the
PHB surface. As a result, the eﬃciency of plastic hydrolysis was
signicantly improved.
223
Recent developments in enzyme design have led to notable
improvements in catalytic activity and a reduction in byproduct
inhibition. For instance, the Tfu_0883 cutinase underwent
a double mutation (Q132A/T101A), resulting in notable
enhancements. The replacement of amino acid residues in the
active site of the TfCut2 cutinase with residues from the LCC
cutinase led to enhanced PET degradation at higher tempera-
tures.
203 Furthermore, the192 substitution of a mutation, Ile179,
in the PETase enzyme with the more hydrophobic Phe resulted
in an enhanced catalytic eﬃciency toward PET substrates at 30 °
C.202 The modications made enhanced the alignment of the
binding sites and resulted in more robust interactions between
the enzyme and substrate. These recent advancements under-
score the signicance of thoughtfully planned enzyme modi-
cations in enhancing the breakdown of PET and other plastic
materials. These strategic modi cations in enzyme surface
properties demonstrate promise for developing more eﬃcient
solutions to the urgent issue of microplastic pollution.
185,192,213
Improving enzyme functionality with the use of accessory
binding domains
In order to enhance the eﬃciency of enzyme-based microplastic
degradation, especially for PET, previous studies have investi-
gated the integration of accessory binding domains that draw
inspiration from the intricate structure of cellulases. These
auxiliary modules, referred to as carbohydrate-binding modules
(CBMs), are segments present in carbohydrate-active enzymes
that facilitate the breakdown of natural biopolymers. The inte-
gration of CBMs into PET hydrolysing enzymes seeks to opti-
mize the interaction of the enzyme with PET, leading to
improved degradation eﬃciency. CBMs are highly regarded for
their excellent compatibility with a wide range of natural poly-
mers and synthetic plastics. Nevertheless, predicting the
protein sequences that determine the function of PET-binding
modules poses a serious challenge due to their inherent
complexity.
224,225
Notable advancements have been achieved in thiseld, such
as the successful combination of a cutinase fromThermobida
fusca with CBMCenA from Cellulomonas mi to enhance the
breakdown of PET bers.216 An alteration was made to
CBMCenA by introducing a single tryptophan mutation. This
modication aimed to enhance its adherence to PETbers and
enable more eﬃcient enzymatic degradation.226 Moreover, the
combination of Thc_Cut1 cutinase fromThermobida cellulosi-
liqua and CBM trCBH fromHypocrea jecorinanotably boosts the
binding of the enzyme to the PET surface, thereby enhancing its
capacity to break down the material. The combination of PET
hydrolases and CBM has demonstrated encouraging outcomes
in enhancing the eﬃciency of PET degradation in various PET
feedstocks.
227
Additional cutting-edge techniques being investigated
involve the use of polyhydroxyalkanoate binding modules
(PBMs), hydroponics, and amphiphilic anchor peptides for
chimeric fusion. These methods focus on enhancing the
attachment of enzymes to PET to improve the degradation of
polyester–PU nanoparticles. As an illustration, the combination
of hydrophobic, a protein with hydrophobic properties, and
PETase has proven to be eﬀective in improving the binding and
degradation of PET lms. These strategies, which aim to
improve the binding ability of PET-degrading enzymes, show
signicant potential in optimizing PET binding and enhancing
hydrolysis eﬃciency. This oﬀers a fresh approach to tackling the
issue of microplastic pollution.

Factors inuencing the eﬃciency of enzymatic plastic
degradation
In order to gain insights into the enzymatic degradation eﬃ-
ciency of microplastics, an extensive analysis was carried out to
examine the distinctive properties of plastic polymers. The
chemical structure, molecular weight, and crystallinity of these
polymers play a crucial role in determining their degradation
rate. Polymers containing ester bonds, such as polyester poly-
urethane, typically demonstrate greater biodegradability in
comparison to polymers lacking these bonds.
228 Biodegradation
of high molecular weight plastics can be more challenging, but
there are additives available that can assist in the process. The
intricate composition of microplastics, with their symmetrical
shapes, strong hydrogen bonds, and regular units, can oen
impede enzymatic degradation.
229
Environmental factors are also inuential in the degradation
process. Temperature is important since elevated temperatures
can speed up degradation and aﬀect oxidation mechanisms.
Accurate pH levels are also important in assessing the activity
and growth of microorganisms that contribute to degradation.
Additionally, diﬀerent pH levels can aﬀect the structure of
plastic and its vulnerability to degradation. UV exposure and
biodegradation are key factors contributing to the breakdown of

plastic. Other factors, such as mechanical shredding, temper-
ature, pH, and catalysts, also play a role in this process.
Humidity plays a signicant role in the biodegradation process.
Higher levels of humidity generally support biodegradation,
while excessive moisture can actually impede the
process.
140,230–232
The degradation kinetics of plastics are in uenced by
a variety of factors, resulting in a complex and multifaceted
degradation process. This review highlights the signicance of
creating eﬃcient enzyme-based strategies that are customized
to the distinct characteristics of various microplastics to
enhance their degradation eﬃciency.
Tackling PET pollution with enzymatic
solutions
Degradation process of PET by hydrolytic enzymes
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a widely used synthetic plastic
found in disposable beverage containers, has experienced
a notable surge in global production. In 2013, a staggering 56
million tons of PET were manufactured.
233 The durability of
PET, stemming from its aromatic ring structure and ester
bonds, plays a signicant role in the issue of plastic pollution.
Improper disposal of single-use plastics further worsens this
problem. In contrast to other biodegradable polyesters such as
polyhydroxyalkanoate, PCL, polybutylene succinate, and poly(-
butylene adipate-coterephthalate) (PBAT), PET is recognized for
its resistance to natural degradation processes. Recent scientic
advances have revealed fascinating insights into certain
microorganisms capable of breaking down PET
polymers.
34,234–236 One such microorganism, Ichneumonella
sakaiensis 201-F6, has demonstrated the ability to utilize the
terephthalate component in its metabolic activity. This
discovery oﬀers a fresh perspective on the degradation of PET
(Fig. 6).
34
A study involvingPseudomonas putida GO16 highlights the
signicant progress made in biotechnology, speci cally in
converting PET into more environmentally friendly materials
such as polyhydroxyalkanoates. This process, which uses
pyrolysis, demonstrates potential for the recycling of PET
waste.
237 The degradation rate of PET lms is inuenced by
various factors including crystallinity, purity, and the orienta-
tion of the polymer chains. These factors greatly aﬀect the
eﬃciency of the degradation process. PET microplastics present
a serious environmental concern due to their potential eﬀects
on human health, specically in relation to the endocrine
system and estrogen regulation.
238,239 This situation highlights
the urgent demand for innovative and eﬃcient degradation and
recycling methods for PET and other synthetic polymers.
Enzyme-based strategies for microplastic degradation have
gained recognition as a viable solution, providing a sustainable
approach to address the environmental consequences of PET
pollution.
Enhancing enzyme technology for eﬃcient PET degradation
Remarkable advancements have been achieved in enhancing
the performance of PETase, the key enzyme in the breakdown of
polyethylene terephthalate (PET), in the area of enzyme-based
microplastic degradation. Prior research has primarily
concentrated on enhancing the interaction of PETase with PET
substrates.
240,241 As an illustration, PETase was modied with
double mutations to enhance the eﬃciency of PET degradation.
We conducted extensive research on double mutations in
Thermobida fusca to gain a deeper understanding of the
enzyme's degradation capabilities.
203
The activity of Cut190, a cutinase variant fromS. viridis,w a s
found to be inuenced by the presence of Ca2+ in the binding
site. Prior research has discovered three calcium binding sites
in Cut190, each exerting distinct eﬀe c t so nt h ea c t i v es i t eo ft h e
enzyme. By making modications to these sites, the thermal
stability of the enzyme was enhanced, and the degradation of
PET was greatly increased.
242 The main function of PETase is to
transform PET into intermediate compounds such as mono-(2-
hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) and bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)
terephthalate (BHET). These c ompounds are subsequently
broken down by MHETase into ethylene glycol (EG) and ter-
ephthalic acid (TPA). These products are subsequently
involved in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. PETase functions
best in a pH range of 7–9 and maintains its stability in a pH
range of 6–10.
243 An optimal pH of 9.0 and a temperature of
30 °C were determined to be the most eﬀective conditions for
the variant of PETase. E ﬀorts to enhance the stability of
Ideonella sakaiensis PETase involved targeted genetic modi-
cations to enhance its resistance to heat and prolong its
eﬀectiveness (Fig. 7).
244
In a previous study, it was discovered that a specic muta-
tion, R280A, demonstrated exceptional eﬃcacy. This mutation
showed enhanced activity and improved hydrolysis eﬃciency
when BHET was used as a substrate. Additional examination of
PETase resulted in the discovery of two mutations that enhance
stability through the formation of hydrogen bonds: the substi-
tution of serine at
247 position 121 with glutamic or aspartic acid,
and the substitution of aspartate at position 186 with histidine.
Fig. 6 Proposed mechanism for PET degradation in Ideonella
sakaiensis. The extracellular PETase enzyme catalyzes the hydrolysis of
PET, yielding MHET as a byproduct. MHETase, predicted to be a lipo-
protein, further hydrolyzes MHET into TPA and EG. Both TPA and EG
can serve as energy sources for Ideonella sakaiensis and other
microbes. Figures generated with BioRender (https://biorender.com/).

RSC Advances Review
The double mutation (serine 121 and aspartate 186) led to the
development of a PETase R280A variant that exhibited
a remarkable enhancement in degradation capacity, resulting
in a 13.9-fold increase in eﬃciency.
182 Recent research has also
investigated the alteration of the protein structure to enhance
plastic degradation. By integrating a poly-3-hydroxybutyrate
(PBM) binding domain into the enzyme, its capacity to break
down PET was greatly enhanced. With professional experi-
mentation, it was discovered that incorporating a CBM domain
into the mutant greatly enhanced the speed at which PET
degradation occurred. In fact, the rate increased by 2.28 times
when compared to the original variant. These advancements
highlight the potential of engineered enzymes in eﬀectively
tackling the issue of PET microplastic pollution.

Approaches to address microplastic
and nanoplastic pollution
Exploring the environmental dynamics of micro- and
nanoplastics
With the rise in plastic production worldwide, it is concerning
to see how plastics are breaking down into microplastics due to
various environmental factors such as ultraviolet light,
temperature uctuations, soil biological activity, and human
involvement. Microplastics can undergo a process where they
break down into even smaller particles called nanoplastics,
which worsens the issue of plastic pollution. These micro-
plastics can take the form ofbers, pellets, spheres, orakes.
The presence of micro- and nanoplastics is widespread in
diﬀerent environments, including land lls, wastewater
systems, industrial and agricultural wastes, and polymer
coatings.
248,249 An in-depth understanding of the sources,
properties, and distribution of these microplastic particles is
crucial in the context of enzyme-based microplastic degrada-
tion strategies.
250 This knowledge is vital for developing eﬃ-
cient measures to minimize their environmental impact. The
extensive dispersion of these pollutants and their challenging
degradation and recycling underscore the pressing need to
tackle this worldwide environmental issue. An all-
encompassing approach is required to take on the extensive
dispersion of micro- and nanoplastics and minimize their
eﬀects on ecosystems.
Biological eﬀects of micro- and nanoplastics
Recent studies have uncovered the profound eﬀects of micro-
plastics and nanoplastics on the biological functions and health
of a wide range of organisms. These studies have highlighted
the negative impacts on ecosystem health and physiological
processes of living organisms. They have emphasized the
detrimental impact of large quantities of microplastics on the
regular functioning of aquatic organisms,
251–253 particularly sh.
These minuscule particles, consumed through food and inha-
lation, result in harm to the tissues ofsh. Giacomo Limonta's
research on zebrash revealed noteworthy alterations in the
expression of immune response genes following exposure to low
concentrations of microplastics. In Mehdi Banaei's research on
Cyprinus carpio, signicant ndings were observed regarding
gene expression and enzyme activity associated with oxidative
stress and detoxi cation. These ndings highlight the
biochemical disruptions caused by microplastics in aquatic
organisms.
254–256
Microplastics present a signicant danger to various forms
of marine life, extending beyond justsh. Microplastics pose
a serious ecological concern due to their capacity to adsorb
heavy metals, harbor bacterial pathogens, carry multidrug-
resistant E. coli , and act as a vector for persistent
pollutants.257–260 The risks are further intensi ed by the
combined eﬀects of manufacturing chemicals and organic
contaminants that are attached to microplastics. Microplastics
also support the development of various microbial communi-
ties and create biolms made up of algae, bacteria, and fungi.
This occurrence has the potential to amplify the transmission of
microbial pathogens and antimicrobial resistance.
261,262
The potential health eﬀects of microplastics on humans are
currently receiving signicant attention. It has been estimated
that a considerable quantity of microplastics is consumed by
humans annually, potentially resulting in various health issues
including intestinal blockages, inammatory reactions, and
alterations in the gut microbiome. This growing research
highlights the importance of further investigating the environ-
mental and health e ﬀects of microplastics and nano-
plastics.
263,264 In particular, there is an urgent demand for the
advancement and improvement of enzyme-based techniques to
eﬀectively break down these prevalent pollutants.

Review RSC Advances
Using microbial capabilities for plastic degradation
The search for microorganisms and enzymes capable of
degrading plastics is gaining importance in the battle against
plastic pollution. This requires the application of molecular
cloning and culture techniques to improve the enzymatic and
metabolic abilities of these microorganisms, thereby enhancing
their potential for plastic degradation.
107 The use of molecular
biology tools, specically polymerase-based rapid cloning, has
been key in the discovery of polymer-degrading enzymes and
the mapping of the genes responsible for these functions. These
tools enable the manipulation of gene expression through
genetic engineering to improve enzyme production, resulting in
more eﬃcient degradation in both the natural environment and
composting facilities.
265
Extensive microbial libraries have been developed to identify
and validate microbes that excel at degrading plastics. Studies
of the 16S rRNA gene in these libraries have yielded valuable
insights into the microbial ecosystems linked to plastics. They
have shed light on the interactions between these communities
and factors such as substrate type, geographic location, and
seasonal variations. The degradation of plastics by microbes is
inuenced by various factors, including the chemical compo-
sition of the polymer, environmental conditions, and the
inherent characteristics of the microbes themselves. The
chemical composition of the polymer is important in deter-
mining its biodegradability, with environmental conditions
playing a supporting role in promoting degradation. Microbial
enzymes are crucial in this process since they selectively target
substrates for biodegradation. It is necessary to understand the
metabolic pathways of microorganisms that eﬃciently degrade
polymers to develop targeted strategies to combat microplastic
pollution. This involves studying bacteria and fungi that play
a key role in this process. This occurrence has the potential to
amplify the transmission of microbial pathogens and antimi-
crobial resistance.
266,267
The potential health eﬀects of microplastics on humans are
currently being closely examined. It is estimated that people
consume substantial quantities of microplastics annually,
resulting in potential health issues such as intestinal blockages,
inammatory reactions, and alterations in the gut microbiome.
This emerging research highlights the importance of ongoing
investigation into the environmental and health e ﬀects of
microplastics and nanoplastics. There is an urgent demand for
the advancement and improvement of enzyme-based tech-
niques to eﬀectively break down these prevalent pollutants.
Conclusions
It is imperative that we address the pressing issue of plastic
pollution caused by the widespread presence of microplastics
and nanoplastics with immediate and eﬃcient measures. This
review has emphasized the signicant role of enzymatic and
microbial strategies in tackling these global environmental and
health challenges. The use of enzymes such as PETase and
MHETase, along with microbial degradation pathways, presents
exciting possibilities for breaking down tough polymers such as
PE, PET, and PS into more environmentally friendly substances.
Despite the notable progress made in understanding and
enhancing the capabilities of specic enzymes and microbes,
there are still challenges that need to be addressed. Factors to
consider are the eﬃciency of the degradation process, the
scalability of these solutions, and the varying properties of
plastic polymers. The signi cance of microplastics on the
environment and health, specically on marine life and human
health, underscores the importance of implementing eﬃcient
degradation and recycling technologies. A combination of
disciplines is needed to address plastic pollution and nd
eﬀective solutions. Further studies and developments are
necessary to enhance the eﬀectiveness and real-world imple-
mentation of enzymatic and microbial degradation methods.
Enzymatic and microbial strategies show great potential in
addressing plastic pollution.
