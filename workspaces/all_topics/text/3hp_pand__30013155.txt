Structural Insight into Substrate 
Specificity of 3-Hydroxypropionyl-
Coenzyme A Dehydratase from 
Metallosphaera sedula
Donghoon Lee1,2 & Kyung-Jin Kim1,2
Metallosphaera sedula is a thermoacidophilic autotrophic archaeon known to utilize the 
3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle (3-HP/4-HB cycle) as carbon fixation pathway. 
3-Hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase (3HPCD) is an enzyme involved in the 3-HP/4-HB cycle by 
converting 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA to acryloyl-CoA. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of 
3HPCD from M. sedula (Ms3HPCD), we determined its crystal structure in complex with Coenzyme A 
(CoA). Ms3HPCD showed an overall structure and the CoA-binding mode similar to other enoyl-CoA 
hydratase (ECH) family enzymes. However, compared with the other ECHs, Ms3HPCD has a tightly 
formed α3 helix near the active site, and bulky aromatic residues are located at the enoyl-group 
binding site, resulting in the enzyme having an optimal substrate binding site for accepting short-chain 
3-hydroxyacyl-CoA as a substrate. Moreover, based on the phylogenetic tree analysis, we propose that 
the 3HPCD homologues from the phylum Crenarchaeota have an enoyl-group binding pocket similar to 
that of bacterial short-chain ECHs.
Due to the increase in carbon dioxide (CO
2) emissions, environmental problems such as climate change have 
attracted much attention around the world, and many countries are making efforts to reduce CO2 emissions with 
climate change measures1–3. As a result, there is a growing interest in microbial strains capable of carbon fixation. 
In prokaryotes, six distinct autotrophic CO2 fixation pathways have been identified so far: the reductive pentose 
phosphate cycle (Calvin-Benson-Bassham cycle)4, the reductive citric acid cycle (Arnon-Buchanan cycle)5,6, the 
reductive acetyl-CoA pathway (Wood-Ljungdahl pathway) 7, the 3-hydroxypropionate/malyl-CoA cycle 8, the 
dicarboxylate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle9, and the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate (3-HP/4-HB) cycle10.
Among the autotrophic CO2 fixation pathways, the 3-HP/4-HB cycle is one of the most recently discovered. 
The thermoacidophilic autotrophic Crenarchaeota is known to have the 3-HP/4-HB cycle11,12. The archaeal phy-
lum Crenarchaeota comprises four orders of hyperthermophilic organisms, namely Sulfolobales, Thermoproteales, 
Desulfurococcales, and Caldisphaerales13,14. Based on the sequence information, Metallosphaera sedula is one of 
the Sulfolobales, which includes Sulfolobus and Acidianus15,16. M. sedula is the most extensively studied thermoac-
idophilic archaea due to its carbon fixation capability using the 3-HP/4-HB cycle 11,17. M. sedula was originally 
isolated from Pisciarelli Solfatara in Naples, Italy, which is a volcanic area with very low pH, high temperature, 
and high metal ion concentrations, and the optimal growth conditions for M. sedula is 75 °C and pH 2.017,18.
The 3-HP/4-HB cycle is largely divided into two sub-pathways, the 3-HP sub-pathway and the 4-HB 
sub-pathway (Fig.  1a). In the 3-HP sub-pathway, acetyl-CoA is converted to succinyl-CoA by the addi-
tion of two molecules of bicarbonate (Fig.  1a). This sub-pathway consists of nine enzymes, including 
3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase (3-HPCD) 10,12,19–21. The 4-HB sub-pathway regenerates acetyl-CoA, 
the first CO 2 acceptor molecule. In the 4-HB sub-pathway, succinyl-CoA is converted into two molecules of 
acetyl-CoA through seven enzymatic reactions (Fig.  1a)10,12,19–21. One of the two acetyl-CoA is used as a start-
ing material for the 3-HP sub-pathway and the other is used for other pathways such as gluconeogenesis. 
3-HPCD catalyzes the dehydration reaction of 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA (3-HP-CoA) to produce acryloyl-CoA 
(Fig. 1a)
10,21. The enzyme belongs to the enoyl-CoA hydratase (ECH) family 21. Although 3-HPCD has been

biochemically studied and characterized21, there have been no structural studies reported so far. In this study, we 
report the first crystal structure of 3-HPCD from M. sedula (Ms3HPCD) in complex with CoA, and reveal how 
the enzyme accommodates 3-HP-CoA as a substrate. Through structural comparisons with other ECH enzymes, 
we also provide insights into how the protein accommodates only short chain hydroxyacyl-CoA as a substrate.
Results and Discussion
Overall structure of Ms3HPCD. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of Ms3HPCD, we purified, crys-
tallized, and determined its crystal structure at a 1.8  Å resolution (Table 1). The atomic structure was in good 
agreement with the X-ray crystallographic statistics for bond angles, bond lengths, and other geometric parame-
ters. The overall structure of Ms3HPCD was similar to that of other enoyl-CoA hydratases from Bacillus anthra-
cis (BaECH, PDB code 3KQF), Mycobacterium tuberculosis  (MtECH, PDB code 3Q0J), and Rattus norvegicus

(RnECH, PDB code 1MJ3, 1DUB, 2DUB) (Fig.  1b)22. The monomeric structure of Ms3HPCD consists of three 
distinct domains: One spiral domain and two trimerization domains (Fig.  2a). The spiral domain (SD; Met1-
Ala124) comprises five β-sheets and four α-helices, and the five centered β-sheets are surrounded by four α-heli-
ces (Fig.  2a). Trimerization domain 1 (TD1; Glu125-Leu184) comprises four α -helices and one β -strand and 
trimerization domain 2 (TD2; Ala185-Arg252) consists of only four α-helices (Fig. 2a). The active site is formed 
between two monomers and all three domains are involved in the formation of the active site (Fig. 2b).
The asymmetric unit of the crystal contained six Ms3HPCD monomers, corresponding to a hexameric assem-
bly (Fig. 2b). Size-exclusion chromatography confirmed that the enzymes also exists as a hexamer in solution 
(Fig. 2c). In general, ECH family enzymes function as hexamer 23,24. The hexamer is formed by dimerization of 
two trimers. The trimer of Ms3HPCD are mainly formed by interactions between TD1 and TD2 (Fig. 2b). TD1 
of one monomer (Mol I) interacts with TD1 and TD2 of neighboring monomer (Mol II), and TD2 of one mon-
omer (Mol I) interacts with SD and TD1 of neighboring monomer (Mol III) (Fig. 2b). Each trimer is stabilized 
by 32 hydrogen bonds and six salt bridges between each monomer. The hexameric structure of Ms3HPCD is 
formed by contact between two trimers, and two α-helices (α10 and α11) of TD2 from each monomer are main 
contributors of hexamerization (Fig. 2b). PISA software calculated that a total of 36,290 Å2 of solvent-accessible 
interface is buried upon hexamer formation. For dimerization of two trimers, a total of 15,050 and 14,380 Å2 of 
solvent-accessible surface areas per each trimer are buried.
Active site of Ms3HPCD. Two glutamate residues (Glu113 and Glu133), which were known to act as cat-
alytic acid and base, respectively, are positioned at the active site of Ms3HPCD. In the vicinity of the catalytic 
residues, Ala65 and Gly110 are positioned to form an oxyanion hole during enzyme catalysis. These four residues 
are completely conserved among the ECH family enzymes; therefore, we suspect that Ms3HPCD catalyzes the 
enzyme reaction in a mode similar to that of other ECH enzymes
25–27. In our current structure, the CoA molecule 
is tightly bound at the substrate binding site (Fig. 3a), although we did not add the molecule during the protein 
expression and purification procedure, which enabled us to identify the CoA binding mode of the enzyme. The 
CoA binding site is formed between three domains, the SD and TD1 of one molecule (Mol I), and the TD2 of the 
neighboring molecule (Mol II) (Fig.  3b). In the crystal structure of Ms3HPCD in complex with CoA, the CoA 
molecule is bent at the diphosphate-moiety (Fig. 3b). The pantothenic acid-moiety of CoA is tightly bound and 
buried in the pocket, whereas the 3′-phosphoadenosine moiety is partially exposed to the surface of Ms3HPCD 
(Fig. 3b). Three lysine residues, Lys24, Lys59, and Lys251, are located at the surface of Ms 3HPCD and stabilize 
the 3′-phosphoadenosine moiety of CoA (Fig. 3c). Lys24 and Lys251 form hydrogen bonds with the phosphate 
moiety of the phosphoribose ring, and Lys59 stabilizes the diphosphate moiety through salt bridges (Fig. 3c). The

oxygen atom of Ala63 also contributes to the stabilization of the β-cystamine moiety (Fig. 3c).
Structural basis for 3-HP-CoA substrate specificity of Ms3HPCD. The ECH family enzymes utilize 
various types of enoyl-CoAs, with carbon chain lengths of 4 to 16 as a substrate28. However, because Ms3HPCD 
utilizes 3-HP-CoA, which has three carbons with a 3-hydroxyl-group, as a substrate, we expected that a rela-
tively small binding pocket might be required for the stabilization of the 3-HP moiety. To provide structural 
basis for how Ms3HPCD accommodates 3-HP-CoA as a substrate, we performed molecular docking calcula-
tions of 3-HP-CoA into its crystal structure. Although the relative position of the CoA moiety of the simulated 
3-HP-CoA is somewhat different from that of the bound CoA molecule in the complex structure, the positions of 
the thiol-group were almost identical between the simulated 3-HP-CoA and the bound CoA molecule (Fig. 4a), 
indicating that the calculated position of the 3-HP moiety might be quite similar to the actual position. The small 
3-HP-binding pocket was formed deep in the enzyme and the 3-HP moiety was perfectly bound in the pocket. 
Four aromatic residues, such as Phe70, Phe81, Tyr142, and Trp232, play crucial roles in the formation of the 
unique small size pocket (Fig. 4b). Among them, two residues, Phe81 and Trp232 seem to be particularly impor-
tant, because these two residues are located at the bottom of the active site and block the substrate-binding tunnel 
(Fig. 4b). Except for two catalytic glutamate residues, main-chains near the 3-HP moiety are mainly involved in 
the stabilization of polar 3-HP moiety through hydrogen bonds. The carbonyl oxygen of the 3-HP moiety forms 
hydrogen bonds with the main-chain nitrogen atoms of Ala65 and Gly110, and with the side-chain of Glu133 
(Fig. 4a). In addition, the 3-hydroxyl-group of 3-HP moiety forms hydrogen bonds with the main-chain nitrogen 
atoms of Gly141 and Tyr142, and with the side-chains of Glu113 and Glu133 (Fig. 4a).
It was known that Ms3HPCD acts almost equally as well on (S )-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA as on 3-HP-CoA
21. 
To elucidate the binding mode of the (S )-3-hydroxybutyryl-moiety to the 3-HP binding pocket, we per -
formed molecular docking calculations of (S )-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA into its crystal structure. The (S )-
3-hydroxybutyryl-moiety of (S )-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA was perfectly matched with the 3-HP-moiety of 
3-HP-CoA, and the 3-hydroxyl-group of (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-moiety was stabilized in a mode identical to the 
3-hydroxyl-group of 3-HP-moiety (Fig. 4a). The C4-moiety is located at the small hydrophobic pocket formed 
by four aromatic residues, such as Phe70, Phe81, Tyr142, and Trp232 (Fig. 4b). These observations explain how 
Ms3HPCD can accommodate both (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA and 3-HP-CoA as a substrate. The surface model of

Ms3HPCD shows that four carbon length acyl-group might be a maximum size of substrate to be accommodated 
at the 3-HP binding pocket (Fig. 4b), indicating that the protein belongs to a short-chain enoyl-CoA hydratase. 
The previous study also showed that Ms3HPCD cannot convert (R )-stereoisomer of 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA 21, 
and the docking calculations of (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA also explain why (R)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA cannot 
be utilized as a substrate of Ms3HPCD. As we described above, the bindings of the 3-hydroxyl- and the C4-moiety 
into the 3-HP binding pocket are mediated through quite specific interactions (Fig.  4a). However, when (R )-
3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA is used as a substrate, the positions of the 3-hydroxyl-group and the C4-moiety are 
reversed each other, resulting in improper positioning of the (R)-3-hydroxybutyryl-moiety in the pocket.
Structural comparison of Ms3HPCD with other ECHs. To compare the 3-HP-binding pocket of 
Ms3HPCD with the enoyl-binding pocket of other ECH enzymes, we selected four ECH enzymes with different 
substrate specificities, including ECH from Homo sapiens (HsECH, PDB code 2HW5), ECH from Rattus nor-
vegicus (RnECH, PDB code 1MJ3) 22, crotonase from Clostridium acetobutylicum (CaCRT, PDB code 5Z7R)29, 
and 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaconyl-CoA Dehydratase from Myxococcus xanthus (MxLiuC, PDB code 5JBX)30. 
RnECH and HsECH are known to utilize long chain enoyl-CoA substrates, whereas CaCRT and MxLiuC accom-
modate short chain enoyl-CoA substrates. When we superimposed the structure of Ms3HPCD on those of HsECH, 
RnECH, CaCRT, and MxLiuC, the overall structures were quite similar to each other, with root-mean-square 
deviation (R.M.S.D.) values of 0.912, 0.823, 0.662, and 1.134 Å over 217, 212, 233, and 198 atoms, respectively. 
However, remarkable structural differences were observed at the bottom of the 3-HP-binding pocket, especially for 
the conformation of the α3 helix and the residues constituting the 3-HP-binding pocket (Fig. 4c). Ms3HPCD and 
CaCRT have a tightly-formed α3 helix at almost identical position, and the residues constituting the 3-HP-binding 
pocket were quite similar to each other. CaCRT has Met71, Phe143, and Phe233 at the positions corresponding to 
Phe70, Tyr142, and Trp232 in Ms3HPCD (Fig. 4c). CaCRT is known to utilize (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA as a sub-
strate, and the observations further support how Ms3HPCD can accommodate both (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA 
and 3-HP-CoA as a substrate. MxLiuC also has a rigid α 3 helix, however, the helix is located slightly further

away from the active site compared with that of Ms3HPCD (Fig.  4c). Moreover, the residues constituting the 
3-HP-binding pocket were also quite different. In MxLiuC, the positions corresponding to Phe70, Tyr142, and 
Trp232 in Ms 3HPCD, are Arg69, Gly141, and Tyr231, making the 3-Hydroxy-3-Methylglutaconyl-binding 
pocket for MxLiuC larger than the 3-HP-binding pocket of Ms3HPCD (Fig. 4d). Importantly, Arg69 might pro-
vide hydrophilicity to stabilize the somewhat hydrophilic substrate. When we compared Rn ECH and HsECH 
with Ms3HPCD, we observed that these enzymes exhibit the highly flexible helix-loop-helix conformation at the

corresponding region of the α3 helix in Ms3HPCD (Fig. 4c). The helix-loop-helix in HsECH and RnECH, espe-
cially the first helix, protrudes out from the substrate binding site, which results in the formation of a long substrate 
binding pocket to accommodate the long chain enoyl-CoA as a substrate (Fig. 4d). These structural observations 
indicated that the conformation of the α3-helix and the residues constituting the enoyl-binding pocket are the key 
elements that determine the substrate specificity of the ECH family enzymes.
Phylogenetic tree analysis of ECH enzymes. Our study revealed that substrate specificities of the ECH 
family enzymes are determined by the conformation of the α3 helix and the residues constituting the enoyl-CoA 
binding pocket. The ECH enzymes such as RnECH and HsECH exhibit a highly flexible helix-loop-helix confor-
mation at the corresponding region of the α3 helix in Ms3HPCD to accommodate long-chain enoyl-CoAs as a 
substrate (Fig. 4c). However, ECH enzymes such as CaCRT and MxLiuC have a tightly-formed α3 helix to accom-
modate short-chain enoyl-CoAs as a substrate (Fig. 4c). We then selected 92 ECH family enzymes from phylogenet-
ically diverse organisms and performed a maximum-likelihood phylogenetic tree analysis. The ECH enzymes could 
be largely divided into two types, ECH
Long and ECHShort (Fig. 5a). Among the 92 ECH enzymes, 77 enzymes, includ-
ing RnECH and HsECH, belong to ECHLong, and they might have a substrate specificity for long-chain enoyl-CoAs 
(Fig. 5a). The ECHLong enzymes can be further classified into two sub-types, bacterial (ECHBac_Long) and eukary-
otic (ECHEuk_Long), according to their origin. The remaining 15 ECH enzymes, including Ms3HPCD, CaCRT and 
MxLiuC, belong to ECHShort and they might have a substrate specificity for short-chain enoyl-CoAs. The ECHShort 
enzymes can be further classified into two sub-types (Fig. 5a), bacterial (ECHBac_Short) and archaeal (ECHArc_Short), 
according to their origin. CaCRT and MxLiuC belong to ECHBac_Short and Ms3HPCD belongs to ECHArc_Short.
We also compared the key amino acids involved in enzyme catalysis and substrate binding among the ECH 
family enzymes. First, we compared the amino acids involved in enzyme catalysis and formation of the oxyan-
ion hole, and all four amino acids, Ala65, Gly110, Glu113, and Glu133 in Ms3HPCD, were completely conserved 
among all ECH enzymes (Fig. 5b). These observations indicate that ECH enzymes catalyze the enzyme reaction in 
an identical mode. Next, we compared the amino acids constituting the α3 helix. Surprisingly, compared with the 
ECH
Short enzymes, all ECHLong enzymes showed deletion of two amino acids at the α3 helix (Fig. 5b). We suspected 
that the amino acid deletion in the ECHLong enzymes prevent the α3 helix from having a tight conformation, instead 
of forming the helix-loop-helix structure, which enables the enzymes to accommodate long-chain enoyl-CoAs as a 
substrate. In addition, amino acids composing the α3 helix were quite different between ECH
Bac_Short and ECHArc_
Short, but were highly homologous within each sub-type (Fig. 5b). Finally, we compared the amino acids constituting 
the enoyl-binding pocket. Interestingly, all four aromatic amino acids, i.e. Phe70, Phe81, Tyr142, and Trp232 in 
Ms3HPCD, were completely conserved among the ECH
Arc_Short enzymes (Fig. 5b). These residues play a crucial role 
in constituting a small 3-HP-binding pocket in Ms3HPCD. The amino acids constituting the enoyl-binding pocket 
in the ECH
Bac_Short enzymes are somewhat different from those of the ECHArc_Short enzymes, and it seems that the 
amino acids forming the enoyl-binding pocket play an important role in distinguishing these two sub-groups.
In summary, we report the first crystal structure of Ms3HPCD in complex with CoA, and provide a structural 
insight into how Ms3HPCD utilizes both (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA and 3-HP-CoA as a substrate. Moreover, we 
suggest that the conformation of the α3 helix and the residues constituting the enoyl-binding pocket are the key 
structural elements that determine the substrate specificity of the ECH family enzymes. The phylogenetic tree 
analysis of the ECH enzymes also suggest that the ECH enzymes from the phylum Crenarchaeota  have highly 
conserved amino acids that determine the substrate specificity of the enzyme.

Preparation of Ms3HPCD proteins.  The Ms3HPCD coding gene (Met1-Lys256, M.W . 28.3 kDa) was 
amplified from the Metallosphaera sedula  chromosome as the template through a polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR). Using the NdeI and XhoI restriction enzymes, the PCR products were then sub-cloned into pET30a 
(Novagen) with 6x-His tag at the C-terminus. The resulting expression vector pET30a: Ms3HPCD was trans-
formed into an Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3)-T1
R strain, which was grown in 1 L of LB medium containing kan-
amycin (50 mgL−1) at 37 °C to OD600 of 0.6. The Ms3HPCD protein expression was induced by adding 1.0 mM 
Isopropyl 1-thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG). After 20 h at 18 °C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation 
at 4000 rpm for 20 minute. The cell pellet was resuspended in buffer A, containing 40 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, and 
disrupted by ultrasonication. The cell debris was removed through centrifugation at 13,500 × g for 25 min, and 
the lysate was loaded onto a Ni-NTA agarose column (QIAGEN). After washing with buffer A containing 25 mM 
imidazole, the bound proteins were eluted with 300 mM imidazole in buffer A. Finally, the trace amount of con-
taminants was removed by a size exclusion chromatography using a HiPrep 26/60 Sephacryl S-300 HR column 
(GE Healthcare Life Sciences) equilibrated with buffer A. All purification experiments were performed at 4 °C. 
SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the purified proteins showed a single polypeptide of 28.3 kDa 
that corresponded to the estimated molecular weight of the Ms3HPCD monomer. The purified protein was con-
centrated to 41 mg mL
−1 in 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0.
Crystallization of Ms3HPCD. Crystallization of the purified Ms3HPCD protein was initially performed 
with commercially available sparse-matrix screens including Index, PEG ion I and II (Hampton Research), Wizard 
Classic I and II, Wizard CRYO I and II (Rigaku Reagents) and Structure Screen I and II (Molecular Dimensions), 
using the hanging-drop vapor-diffusion method at 20 °C. Each experiment consisted of mixing 1.0 µL protein solu-
tion (41 mg mL
−1 in 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0) with 1.0 µL of reservoir solution and equilibrating the drop against 
50 µL reservoir solution. Ms3HPCD crystals were observed from several crystallization screening conditions. After 
several optimization steps for crystal improvement, crystals of the best quality appeared in 4 days using a reservoir 
solution consisting of 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000, 0.1 M Sodium-potassium phosphate, pH 6.2, 0.2 M 
Sodium Chloride, and 10 mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) disodium salt dehydrate at 20 °C.

Data collection and structure determination of Ms3HPCD. The crystals were transferred to a 
cryo-protectant solution composed of 10% (w/v) polyethylene glycol (PEG) 8000, 0.1 M Sodium-potassium phos-
phate, pH 6.2, 0.2 M Sodium Chloride, 10 mM Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) disodium salt dehydrate and 
30% (v/v) glycerol, fished out with a loop larger than the crystals, and flash-frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen. 
Data was collected to a resolution of 1.8 Å at 7 A beamline of the Pohang Accelerator Laboratory (PAL, Pohang, Korea),

using a Quantum 270 CCD detector (ADSC, USA)31. All data were indexed, integrated, and scaled together using 
the HKL2000 software package32. The crystals of Ms3HPCD in complex with CoA belonged to P21 with unit cell 
parameters a = 84.685 Å, b = 130.17 Å, c = 84.791 Å, α = γ = 90°, β = 119.57°. Assuming six Ms3HPCD molecules in 
asymmetric unit, the crystal volume per unit of protein mass was 2.39 Å3 Da−1, which means the solvent content was 
approximately 48.65%33. The structure of Ms3HPCD in complex with CoA was determined by molecular replacement 
with the CCP4 version of MOLREP34 using the structure of enoyl-CoA hydratase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis 
(MtECH, PDB code 3PZK) as a search model. Model building was performed manually using the program WinCoot35, 
and refinement was performed with CCP4 refmac536. The data statistics are summarized in Table 1 and the refined 
Ms3HPCD structure in complex with CoA was deposited in the protein data bank under the PDB code 5ZAI.
Size-exclusion chromatographic analysis. To investigate the oligomerization of Ms3HPCD, analytical 
size-exclusion chromatography was performed using a Superdex increase 200 10/300 GL column (GE Healthcare 
Life Sciences) equilibrated with 40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0 and 150 mM NaCl. Protein sample of 1 mL with con-
centration of 1 mg mL−1 was analyzed. The molecular weights of the eluted samples were calculated based on the 
calibration curve drawn using standard samples of ferritin (440 kDa), conalbumin (75 kDa), carbonic anhydrase 
(29 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa) (GE Healthcare Life Sciences).
Molecular docking simulation of Ms3HPCD. Molecular docking simulations of 3-HP-CoA and (S )-
3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA to Ms3HPCD structure were performed by AutoDock Vina software37. The ligand mol-
ecule of Ms3HPCD, 3-HP-CoA and (S)-3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA, were prepared using the JLigand software. For 
the docking simulation, the pdbqt files were generated using AutoDock Vina manual. The grid size for 3-HP-CoA 
was x = 16, y = 22, z = 16, and grid box was centered at x = 16.811, y = −8.113, z = 3.327. The final conformations 
produced in this simulation were checked using PyMOL software
38.
Phylogenetic tree analysis. Iterative searching for 3HPCD-like proteins was performed by Basic Local 
Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) in National Center for Biotechnology information (NCBI) server using 
position-specific iterated BLAST (PSI-BLAST) method
39. Multiple alignment was performed by Clustal omega40. 
The evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based on the Le_Gascuel_2008 
model
41. The tree with the highest log likelihood (−20025.9646) is shown. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search 
were obtained automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise distances 
estimated using a JTT model, and then selecting the topology with superior log likelihood value. A discrete 
Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (5 categories (+ G, parame-
ter = 0.9794)). The rate variation model allowed for some sites to be evolutionarily invariable ([+ I], 9.9777% 
sites). The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths measured in the number of substitutions per site. The 
analysis involved 92 amino acid sequences. All positions with less than 95% site coverage were eliminated. That 
is, fewer than 5% alignment gaps, missing data, and ambiguous amino acids were allowed at any position. There 
were a total of 254 positions in the final dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in MEGA7
42.
