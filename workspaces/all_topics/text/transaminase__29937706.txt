Abstract: Several chemoenzymatic routes have been explored for the preparation of cinacalcet, a
calcimimetic agent. Transaminases (TAs) and ketoreductases (KREDs) turned out to be useful biocatalysts
for the preparation of key optically active precursors. Thus, the asymmetric amination of 1-acetonaphthone
yielded an enantiopure ( R)-amine, which can be alkylated in one step to yield cinacalcet. Alternatively, the
bioreduction of the same ketone resulted in an enantiopure ( S)-alcohol, which was easily converted into the
previous ( R)-amine. In addition, the reduction was efficiently performed with the KRED and its cofactor co-
immobilized on the same porous surface. This self-sufficient heterogeneous biocatalyst presented an
accumulated total turnover number (TTN) for the cofactor of 675 after 5 consecutive operational cycles.
Finally, in a preparative scale synthesis the TA-based approach was performed in aqueous medium and led to
enantiopure cinacalcet in two steps and 50% overall yield.

1 Introduction
Cinacalcet ( 1), chemically N-[(1R)-1-(naphthyl)ethyl]-
3-[3-(trifluoromethyl)-phenyl]propane-1-amine,[1] is a
calcimimetic approved for the treatment of secondary
hyperparathyroidism in patients with chronic kidney
disease (CKD) receiving dialysis and for the treatment
of hypercalcaemia associated to parathyroid carcino-
ma.
[2] The plethora of reported syntheses are based
mainly on the coupling of a chiral precursor, namely
(R)-(+)-1-(1-naphthyl)ethylamine ( 2), with an achiral
moiety by different strategies: e.g. amide or imine
formation followed by reduction, or nucleophilic
substitution.
[3] The key chiral amine was accessed by
classical or enzymatic resolutions which suffer from
the inherent 50% maximum yield
[4] or by several
asymmetric synthetic approaches in organic media. [5]
The excellent properties displayed by enzymes in
terms of selectivity and reactivity under mild reaction
conditions make enzymatic catalysis an attractive
alternative for the production of building blocks for
pharmaceuticals.
[6] Thus, taking the advances in the

present biocatalytic toolbox into consideration as well
as the structural features of cinacalcet, we devised
three feasible chemoenzymatic approaches from 1-
acetonaphthone ( 3, Scheme 1). Specifically, the asym-
metric step would be catalyzed by different enzymes:
a) a direct amination of 3 with 3-(3-(trifluoromethyl)
phenyl)propan-1-amine ( 5) mediated by imine reduc-
tases (IREDs), to provide 1 in a single step; b) an
asymmetric amination of 3 using transaminases (TAs)
to yield the primary amine ( R)-2; c) an asymmetric
reduction catalyzed by ketoreductases (KREDs).
Then, in the last two approaches the selective follow-
up chemistry of the resulting optically active com-
pounds would enable facile entry to cinacalcet accord-
ing to reported methods. Herein, we report our
findings on the development of novel chemoenzymatic
routes towards this drug.
2 Results and Discussion
2.1 IRED-Catalyzed Reductive Amination of 3
Traditionally, chiral amines have been prepared
enzymatically from racemates and by means of a
kinetic resolution based on lipase-catalyzed aminolysis
or hydrolysis reactions.
[7] However, in the last decade
other enzymatic approaches converting prochiral
carbonyl compounds into amines have emerged as a
valuable alternative: i) TAs transfer a primary amino
group from a donor substrate to an acceptor com-
pound mediated by pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP);
[8] ii)
amino dehydrogenases (AmDHs) catalyze the NAD
(P)H-dependent reductive amination of carbonyl com-
pounds with ammonia;
[9] iii) IREDs and its recently
discovered subclass reductive aminases (RedAms)
accept secondary linear and cyclic amino donors and
give entry to secondary and tertiary amines which are
not accessible by using the previous enzymes.
[10]
Initially, we focused on the most straightforward
approach to cinacalcet, namely the IRED-catalyzed
reductive amination of 3. To this end, we used the
commercially available amine 5 and screened a set of
IREDs overexpressed in E. coli from the Greifswald
University collection (Scheme 2).
[11] Unfortunately,
and despite using a high excess of amine (50 equiv-
alents), this combination of substrates did not yield
detectable product after 48 h. In view of this, we were
interested whether the ketone 3 or the amine 5 was
causing the limitation. Actually, whereas ketones of
comparable size to 3 have been successfully converted
by IREDs, 5 might be a challenging amino donor since
it is by far bigger than reported examples.
[10c,d] Besides,
a drawback could arise from the unfavorable equili-
brium of imine formation in water for 3 even though
some substantial evidences have recently supported
the imine formation in the active site of some IREDs
with a selection of ketone and amine partners
(Scheme 2).
[10d] Further attempts performed with the
chemically synthesized imine 6 and IREDs did not
show conversion in any case.
2.2 Transaminase Catalyzed Amination of 3
Given the disappointing results displayed by IREDs,
we turned our attention to the amination of 3 employ-
ing TAs which would enable the primary amine 2 in
100% yield, [12] one step away from cinacalcet. Thus, 3
was screened with a series of 28 commercially
available TAs (Codex /C24Amine Transaminase Screen-
ing Kit) and also with several TAs overexpressed in E.
coli.
In a first set of experiments 3 was assayed at a
20 mM substrate concentration with the commercial
kit of TAs at 45 8C in 100 mM phosphate buffer
pH 9.0, supplemented with PLP (1 mM) and isopro-
pylamine ( iPrNH
2, 1 M). Additionally, 10% v/v of
DMSO was added due to the solubility issues of 3.
Under these conditions, some of the TAs were very
active and reached high conversions after 24 h. More
interestingly, almost all of them displayed perfect
asymmetry in the amination of the carbonyl group,

leading to the target ( R)-2 with >99% ee and also its
counterpart ( S)-2 depending on the catalyst. Table 1
shows selected results of this screening. [13] Further
attempts at higher substrate concentration (50 mM)
resulted in lower conversion, as typically observed
with TAs (entries 2, 4 and 6). Concerning the TAs
overexpressed in E. coli, only variants of the R-
selective ArRmut11
[14] emerged as active biocatalysts.
Originally, ArRmut11 has been specifically evolved
starting from a wild type enzyme [15] for ketones
bearing two bulky substituents on an industrial
setting.
[14] Just recently, the introduction of further
mutations reducing the size of one of the two binding
pockets while maintaining the exceptionally high
activity and stability of ArRmut11 has been re-
ported.
[16] Thus, we envisioned variants ArRmut11-
G279A, ArRmut11-M117F/G279A and ArRmut11-
A60V/M117F/G279A to be convenient catalysts for
the transformation of ketone 3. They were used as
lyophilized cells under slightly different reaction
conditions, namely 45 8C, 800 rpm, 100 mM phosphate
buffer pH 9.0 (1 mM PLP , 500 mM iPrNH
2) and 20%
v/v DMSO. Interestingly, the substrate concentration
could be increased to 50 mM. Again, 3 was aminated
with perfect enantioselectivity, ( R)-2 being obtained in
enantiopure form in all cases (entries 10–12). Like-
wise, the conversion after 48 h was up to 80%. Further
attempts at higher concentrations such as 100 mM and
200 mM resulted in a drastic drop in conversion.
In view of the excellent stereoselectivity displayed
by the ArRmut11 variants, we took the challenge of
optimizing the biotransformation heading for a proc-
ess scale up in a manufacture setting. Hence, aiming at
a conversion enhancement, we tested other amino
donors such as d-alanine, benzylamine and ( R)-a-
methylbenzylamine (MBA) in a high molar excess
since the thermodynamic equilibrium is strongly
shifted towards 3. Table 2 collects the conversion
measured at different reaction times with these
reagents. In no case traces of the ( S)-enantiomer were
detected by HPLC, which demonstrates the perfect
selectivity exerted by the TAs. On the other hand, d-
alanine was not a suitable amino donor for these
enzymes, with conversions up to 5% due to thermody-
namics as one possible reason. Concerning the other
reagents, the three ArRmut11 variants led to similar
conversions with values around 80%. Therefore, and
attending to its lower price and facility to be removed,
we opted for implementing the amination based on
iPrNH
2 in the synthetic scheme.

2.3 KRED-Catalyzed Bioreduction of 3
The last approach displayed in Scheme 1 towards
cinacalcet consisted in a stereoselective reduction of 3
to yield ( S)-1-(1-naphthyl)ethanol [( S)-4].[17] For this,
the panel of engineered KREDs from Codexis was
tested employing glucose/glucose dehydrogenase
(GDH) or isopropanol (IPA) for cofactor recycling.
Initially, the screening was performed at 27 mM
substrate concentration with a phosphate buffer
pH 7.0, IPA (15% v/v) and DMSO (5% v/v). The
reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 8C and
250 rpm during 24 h. From the series of KREDs
contained in the kit, it was possible to identify
biocatalysts affording both enantiomers of 4 with
complete conversion and excellent enantioselectivity
(Table 3). Actually, the ( S)-enantiomer of 4 is the
target compound for our synthetic purposes towards 1,
as discussed later.
Very recently the co-immobilization of a ketore-
ductase and NADPH on agarose beads activated with
tertiary amine groups (AG-DEAE) has been reported.
The resulting catalyst, defined as self-sufficient hetero-
geneous biocatalyst, was able to catalyze asymmetric
reductions without exogenous cofactor addition.
[18]
Moreover, it could be successfully re-used several
batch operational cycles and operated in a plug-flow
reactor. Seeing as the exquisite selectivity and con-
version displayed by the KREDs towards 3,w e
envisaged to integrate this technology into the present
synthetic approach.
[19] Actually, many promising enzy-
matic processes are often hampered by their cofactor
dependency that requires very expensive reagents,
endangering the economic viability.
[20] With these
premises, KRED/C0P2-D11 was immobilized on porous
agarose beads activated with diethyl-aminoethyl
groups (AG-DEAE) (Table 4). 96% of the offered
enzyme was immobilized preserving 100% of its
specific activity. The high expressed activity upon the
immobilization is an excellent result compared to
those reported for other KREDs.
[18,21] Under the
operational conditions tested in Table 3, the immobi-
lized enzyme was 9 times more stable than its soluble
counterpart (Table 4). Both immobilized and soluble
enzyme underwent a first-order inactivation with
residual activity under those inactivation conditions
(Supporting information, Figure S1).
The high activity and stability of the immobilized
KRED P2-D11 encouraged us to co-immobilize higher
KRED loads (6.5 mg
3gcarrier
/C01)w i t hN A D P H( 1 0mmol
of NADPH per gram of carrier ). Then, the resulting
biocatalyst was tested for the reduction of 3 using 3% of
catalyst load and IPA as sacrificing reductant. We found
a conversion of >99% after 24 h preserving the
enantioselectivity of the KRED [ >99% ee for ( S)-4]
without exogenous supply of NADPH. Moreover, this
self-sufficient biocatalyst was reused up in 5 consecutive
cycles without losing effectiveness (Table 5) with a
catalyst load decreased by a factor of 9 (0.195 mg
KRED/
mL) regarding to the free enzyme (1.79 mg KRED/mL).

The recyclability of the biocatalyst significantly increased
the total turnover number (TTN) of both enzyme and
cofactor. Hence, the immobilized NADPH accumulated
a TTN of 450 whereas the KRED did 3600. On the
other hand, we studied the continuous asymmetric
reduction of 3 in a bed-packed flow reactor using the
self-sufficient heterogeneous biocatalyst. Unfortunately,
the systems failed observing conversions <5% at 50–
200 mL
3min/C01 flow rates. Unlike the enzyme of the
original report, namely KRED P1-A04, [18] KRED P2-
D11 immobilized on the same matrix (AG-DEAE) was
inefficient recycling the im mobilized redox cofactor
which burdened the continuous production of ( S)-4 (see
the Supporting Information for more details).
2.4 Chemoenzymatic Synthesis of Cinacalcet
The synthetic sequences towards 1 are depicted in
Scheme 3. The TA-based approach (route A) started
with the amination of 3 with iPrNH
2 catalyzed by
ArRmut11-M117F/G279A (Table 2, entry 2). This bio-
transformation was scaled up to 100 mg with 3 at
50 mM substrate concentration to render enantiopure
(R)-2 in 77% yield. Then, and after extractive work
up, this amine was directly alkylated in toluene with 3-
[3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]propan-1-ol ( 7) mediated
by the iridium catalyst [Cp*IrCl
2]2 (1 mol%).[22] Thus,
1 was isolated after filtration through silica gel with a
yield of 60% for the overall two-step sequence.
Encouraged by this result, we took the challenge of
developing a one-pot sequential synthesis of cinacalcet
in aqueous medium. Actually, a related catalyst
[Cp*IrI
2]2 was reported to promote the alkylation of
equimolar amounts of amine and alcohol in water. [23]
Hence, a first issue was confirming that [Cp*IrCl 2]2
catalyzes the coupling of 2 and 7 in refluxing water.
Pleasantly, the process took place with high yield and
water as the only by-product released. Accordingly,
the amination of 3 catalyzed by ArRmut11-M117F/
G279A was performed again as described above. Next,
the reaction mixture containing enantiopure ( R)-2 was
evaporated to dryness to remove the excess of iPrNH
2,
preventing the consumption of alcohol 7 by the amino
donor. Then, the resulting crude product was sus-
pended in water and treated with 7 and catalyst
[Cp*IrCl2]2 (1 mol%) at reflux. Unfortunately, no
product was detected after 12 h which suggested metal
inhibition by the enzyme or its cofactor. A further
attempt consisted in testing commercially available
TAs instead of lyophilized whole cells to simplify the
enzymatic milieu. However, the iridium catalyst was
totally inhibited again, precluding the one-pot proc-
ess.
[24] Nevertheless, the only required setting to solve
this drawback was removing the insolubles (e.g.,
precipitated protein) by centrifugation after the
enzymatic step, and adding to the supernatant both
[Cp*IrCl
2]2 and 7. Under this experimental setting,
enantiopure 1 was produced with an overall yield of
50%.
Concerning the KRED-based approach (route B),
the first step was affording the enantiopure alcohol
(S)-4 with complete conversion by using one of the
two last enzymes depicted in Table 3 (entries 6–7).
Then, and following a patented procedure (route B1),
the hydroxyl group was treated with mesyl chloride to
make it a good leaving group for a further nucleophilic
substitution.
[25] However, 1-(1-chloroethyl)naph-
thalene ( 8) was isolated in racemic form instead of the
expected mesyl derivative. Similarly, the employment
of tosyl chloride led to identical outcome. In this
context, a study a few years ago showed that the
treatment of electron withdrawing group-substituted
benzyl alcohols with tosyl chloride renders chloride
derivatives instead of the expected tosylates.
[26] On the
other hand, the fact of obtaining racemic species
reveals the formation of a carbocation, via S N1
mechanism, which would be stabilized by the phenyl
ring and reacted with Cl
/C0to form racemic 8.I na
further attempt, the employment of AgNO 3 as a
scavenger of chloride ions enabled to obtain the
mesylate 9 (route B2). Subsequent nucleophilic sub-
stitution with the amine 10 gave entry to 1 although as
a racemate. This suggests the lability of the mesyl
derivative and the inconvenience of this methodology.
Finally, the use of a base such as DBU in the presence
of diphenyl phosphorazidate (DPPA) suppressed the
S
N1 chemistry and rendered the azide ( R)-9 of
opposite stereochemistry with a very slight erosion of
the enantiomeric purity (97% ee, route B3).
[27] Then,
LiAlH4 reduction provided the amine ( R)-2 which was
converted into 1 as described above. The overall yield
of the formal total synthesis of 1 was 65% after four
steps. Comparing both chemoenzymatic approaches,
route A (TA-based approach) involves two less steps
and does not require chromatographic purification.
Likewise, and from an environmental point of view, it

3 Conclusion
Two chemoenzymatic syntheses towards cinacalcet,
the only approved drug acting as calcimimetic, have
been developed. In the first route, the key asymmetric
step was an amination of the ketone 3 employing TAs.
Further iridium-catalyzed alkylation of the resulting
enantiopure amine ( R)-2 led to cinacalcet in 50%
overall yield for the two-step sequence. Notably, both
steps were run in aqueous medium and the process did
not require purification or isolation of any intermedi-
ates. On the other hand, the bioreduction of the same
ketone by KREDs provided enantiopure alcohol ( S)-4
quantitatively. Then, further follow-up chemistry en-
abled the amine ( R)-2 via S
N2 inversion with DPPA
and further reduction of the resulting azide, to
complete the synthetic scheme towards cinacalcet in
four steps and 65% overall yield. Despite the second
route requiring more steps, the KRED was success-
fully co-immobilized with NADPH giving the possibil-
ity to be re-used in 5 batch operational cycles without
adding of exogenous NADPH.
Experimental Section
General Remarks
Kits of TAs and KREDs were purchased from Codexis. The
cultures for overexpression of the IREDs were inoculated
from E. coli BL21 (DE3) glycerol stocks from Greifswald
University containing the respective IREDs in a pET 22b( +)
vector. The standard procedure for expression was followed
as described in ref. 11a. TA variants from ArRmut11 were
overexpressed in E. coli and used as lyophilized cells (for
more details about these TAs, see ref. 16). For the enzymatic
reactions, commercially available solvents were used. Thin-
layer chromatography was performed on precoated TLC
plates of Merck silica gel 60F
254, using potassium
permanganate as developing reagent. For column chroma-
tography, Merck silica gel 60 (particle size, 40–63 mm) was
used.
1H NMR and proton-decoupled 13C NMR spectra were
obtained using a 300 MHz spectrometer using the d scale

CDCl3 (13C; 76.95 ppm) or the residual CHCl 3 (1H; 7.26 ppm)
signals. HPLC analyses to determine degree of conversions
were carried out in an Agilent RR1200 HPLC system, using
a reversed phase column (Zorbax Eclipse XDB /C0C18, RR,
18 mm, 4.6
350 mm, Agilent). HPLC analyses to determine
ee were performed on a Hewlett Packard 1100 LC liquid
chromatograph, using normal phase columns (Chiralcel
OJ/C0H and Chiralpak IA).
Amination of 3 Employing TAs from the Codexis’ Kit
(Analytical Scale)
Reactions were carried out in a 2.0 mL Eppendorf tube. The
corresponding TA (1.0 mg) was added to 500 mL of 100 mM
KH2PO4 buffer pH 9.0 containing iPrNH2 (1 M) and the
cofactor PLP (1.0 mM). Then, a solution of 3 (20 mM) in
DMSO (50 mL) was added and the resulting mixture was
shaken at 250 rpm and 45 8C for 24 h. To determine the
conversion, 10 mL of the mixture were diluted with 90 mLo f
Milli-Q water and analyzed by achiral reverse phase with
previous centrifuging and filtering of the sample. Then, the
reaction was quenched by addition of 100 mL of aqueous
10 N NaOH and extracted with ethyl acetate (2
3500 mL).
The organic layers were separated by centrifugation (90 s,
13000 rpm), combined, and finally dried over Na 2SO4. Then,
the ee of the amine was determined by chiral normal phase.
Amination of 3 Employing Variant
ArRmut11-M117F/G279A (Preparative Scale)
Ketone 3 (100 mg, 0.588 mmol) was placed in a bottom
round flask containing 10.0 mL of 100 mM KH 2PO4 buffer
(pH 9, 0.5 M iPrNH2, 1 mM PLP). Then, lyophilized whole
cells of ArRmut11-M117F/G279A (200 mg) were added and
the resulting suspension magnetically stirred at 800 rpm and
458C for 72 h. To determine the conversion, 10 mLo ft h e
mixture were diluted with 90 mL of Milli-Q water and
analyzed by achiral reverse phase with previous centrifuging
and filtering of the sample. After that time the reaction was
basified with a saturated solution of Na
2CO3 (5 mL) and
extracted with ethyl acetate (2 35 mL). The organic layers
were separated by centrifugation (90 s, 13000 rpm), com-
bined, and finally dried over Na 2SO4. Then, the resulting
amine ( R)-2 was submitted to the next synthetic step without
further purification (Scheme 3, route A). Eventually, for an
analytical sample the amine 2 was purified by flash
chromatography of by acid-base extraction (78 mg, 77%
yield). The ee of ( R)-2 was determined by chiral normal
phase (>99%).
Bioreduction of 3 Employing KREDs from the
Codexis’ Kit (Analytical Scale)
In a 2.0 mL Eppendorf tube, KRED (2 mg), 3 (27 mM),
DMSO (55 mL) and i-PrOH (165 mL) were added to 900 mL
of 125 mM KH 2PO4 buffer (1.25 mM MgSO 4,1 m M
NADP+) pH 7.0 or 900 mL of 250 mM KH 2PO4 buffer (2 mM
MgSO4, 1.1 mM NADP +,8 0m M d-glucose, 10 U/mL glucose
dehydrogenase) pH 7.0 in the case of KRED-101, KRED-
119, KRED-130, KRED-NADH-101 and KRED-NADH-
110. The reaction was shaken at 250 rpm and 30 8C for 24 h.
To determine the conversion, 10 mL of the mixture were
diluted with 90 mL of Milli-Q water and analyzed by achiral
reverse phase with previous centrifuging and filtering of the
sample Then the mixture was extracted with ethyl acetate
(23500 mL), the organic layers separated by centrifugation
(90 sec, 13000 rpm), combined and dried over Na 2SO4. Then,
the ee was measured by chiral normal phase.
Immobilization of, Thermal Stability and Activity
Assay of KRED P2-D11 Immobilized on Ag-DEAE
The protein immobilization was carried out with 1 g of AG-
DEAE incubated with 10 mL of 0.1–0.65 mg/mL KRED P2-
D11 in 10 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.0 for 1 h at room
temperature. Then, 1 g of AG-DEAE immobilizing KRED
was incubated with 10 mL of 1 mM NADPH in 10 mM Tris-
HCl at pH 7.0. The operational stability was determined by
incubating soluble and immobilized KRED under the
reaction conditions (1 mM MgCl
2, 4.9% DMSO and 17%
IPA in a 10 mM tris-HCl at pH 7.0) at 30 8C. Samples were
withdrawn at different incubation times and the residual
enzymatic activity was spectrophotometrically determined.
For this purpose, the activity of KRED was measured by
monitoring the absorbance at 340 nm along the time in a
Varioskan
TM Flash Multimode Reader (Thermo Scientific)
using 96-well plates. Briefly, 200 mL of a reaction mixture
containing 1 mM of 3, 1 mM MgCl 2, 0.25 mM of NADH and
9% Acetonitrile in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0)
was incubated with 20 mL of enzymatic solution or suspen-
sion at 25 8C under orbital shaking integrated into the reader.
One unit of activity was defined as the amount of enzyme
that was required to either reduce or oxidize 1 mmol of
NADPH at 25 8C and pH 7.0.
Bioreduction of 3 in Batch Employing an Immobilized
KRED
In a micro Bio-spinTM chromatographic column (BIO-
RAD), a reaction mixture containing 3 (27 mM) and 1.0 mL
of 17% IPA in 10 mM Tris-HCl and 1 mM MgCl 2 at pH 7.0
was incubated with 30 mg of self-sufficient heterogeneous
biocatalysts (6.5 mg KRED P2 /C0D11 and 10 mmolNADPH/gcarrier) and
maintained under gentle rotational agitation (50 rpm) at
258C. As control reaction, same amount of KRED immobi-
lized on AG-DEAE and soluble and exogenous NADPH
were mixed in the same conditions. The reaction was stopped
by vacuum filtration and the conversion and ee determined
as described above. Next, the immobilized biocatalyst was
washed with 10 volumes of 10 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.0 to be
re-used in the next batch cycle.
Bioreduction of 3 in Continuous-flow Mode
Employing an Immobilized KRED
1 g of self-sufficient heterogeneous biocatalyst (5.85 mgKRED P2-D11
and 10 mmolNADPH/gcarrier) were packed into a column (2 30.4 cm)
and connected to a flow system driven by a syringe pump. A
