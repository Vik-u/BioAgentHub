Introduction
In the year of 2022, production of catfish in international 
markets was dominated by Pangasianodon 
hypophthalmus with the level of 2,520,400 tonnes 
compared to Clarias sp. with the level of 1,249,000 
tonnes (FAO, 2023), with the highest production 
being contributed by Vietnam. The production of P.  
hypophthalmus in Indonesia in the year 2022 increased 
to 340,444.02 tons from 332,022.98 tons in the year 
2021 by 2.54%, and this production is only used to 
meet the requirements of the local market. Catfish 
production currently does not have global competition; 
therefore, it must increase production to fill the 
international market.
The liver is an organ with important roles in 
physiological processes, such as detoxification and 
immune responses, and as a center of metabolism 
that plays an important role in biological processes 
(Wolf and Wolfe, 2005; Xu et al., 2018). The livers 
of female fish and oviparous animals have high 
estrogen receptor concentrations; thus, the liver can 
be stimulated by estrogen to synthesize and secrete 
vitellogenin in high numbers and concentrations 
(Sumpter and Jobling, 1995). Vitellogenin is a material 
synthesized by hepatocytes following stimulation with 
estradiol that is further transported and deposited in 
the follicles (Mommsen and Walsh, 1988; Sullivan and 
Yilmaz, 2018). The production of vitellogenin during 
vitellogenesis is highly determined by the number and 
function of hepatocytes and the amount of estradiol that 
stimulates hepatocytes. The capacity of hepatocytes to 
synthesize vitellogenin is highly determined by the 
Physiological responses of catfish liver to katuk extract, turmeric powder, 
and vitamin C supplementation in the diet during ovarium development

ABSTRACT
Background: The success of reproduction in oviparous animals is determined by the optimum vitellogenin deposition in 
the follicles. Vitellogenin is synthesized by hepatocytes in response to estrogen stimulation. Hepatocyte functionalities 
are important for the production of vitellogenin. This research was designed to increase liver function using catfish as 
a model.
Aim: Hepatocyte function can be improved by katuk extract, turmeric powder, and vitamin C supplementation.
Methods: The experiment consisted of eight treatments and three repetitions. The treatments were administered for 
8 weeks. The parameters measured were the hepatosomatic index (HSI), histology of the liver, concentrations of 
serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), and superoxide 
dismutase (SOD).
Results: HSI in catfish supplemented with a combination of katuk extract, turmeric powder, and vitamin C showed 
the highest values. The liver histology of catfish supplemented with turmeric powder showed the lowest level of 
hepatocyte vacuolization compared with the findings for all treatments without turmeric supplementation. The SOD 
values were increased in the groups of catfish supplemented with turmeric powder with SGPT, whereas the SGOT 
values were decreased compared with those of catfish without turmeric powder supplementation.
Conclusion: It is concluded that turmeric powder supplementation can improve hepatocyte capacity and function 
to support vitellogenin synthesis to be deposited in growing and developing oocytes. This research will increase the 
production of farmed fish.

The materials
Materials used in this experiment are 24 adult female 
catfish (P . hypophthalmus) obtained from Sukamandi 
Fish Breeding and Research Center, Subang, West 
Java, Indonesia, 70% ethanol, feed, egg albumin, katuk 
leaves from Tarakan, North Kalimantan, Indonesia, 
turmeric powder from Balai Penelitian Tanaman 
Obat dan Aromatik (Balitro) Kemtan, Cimanggu 
Bogor, vitamin C (Luwei Pharmaceutical Group), and 
hematoxylin eosin.
Methods
Preparation of the maintenance pond
The experimental catfish were maintained in the ponds 
with a size of 10 × 8 × 1 m using a waring with the size 
of 3 × 3 × 0.5 m.
Preparation of katuk leaf extract and turmeric powder
Katuk leaves were extracted using a maceration method 
with 70% ethanol solution. Katuk leaves were wind 
dried for 1 week. The dried leaves were then blended 
until smooth and then soaked in 70% ethanol at a 1:3 
ratio for 3 days. After 3 days, the extract was filtered 
using filter paper. The solution was then evaporated to 
separate the extract from the solvent. The extract in the 
form of a paste was then frozen dry for 1 week until 
the extract hardened. The turmeric powder used was 
obtained from Balai Penelitian Tanaman Rempah dan 
Obat (BALITRO) Cimanggu, Bogor, Indonesia.
Experimental feed preparation
The feed used is commercial, combined with katuk 
extract, turmeric powder, and vitamin C. The 
commercial feed used was HI-PRO-VITE 781. One 
kilogram of feed was mixed with one egg in 100 ml of 
water with katuk extract, turmeric powder, and vitamin 
C, then mixed and air dried at room temperature.
Experimental design
The experimental fish used in this experiment are mature 
female catfish. The number of experimental catfishes 
used was 24. The broodstock used was unmated mature 
female fish obtained from BRPI Sukamandi, West Java 
Province, Indonesia. The experimental catfish were 
maintained in the pond at a size of 10 × 8 × 1 m using 
a waring with the size of 2 × 3 × 0.5 m each, with 
three mature female catfish. The catfishes were given 
feed at a dose of 5%/BW with a frequency of morning 
and afternoon feeding. The experimental fish were 
maintained and given the treatment for 8 weeks.
The feed used in the experiment was commercial 
feed supplemented with katuk leaf extract at a dose of 
0.6 g/kg feed, turmeric powder at a dose of 48 g/kg 
feed (Dewi et al., 2018), and vitamin C at a dose of 599 
mg/kg feed (Sarmento et al., 2018). This experiment 
used a completely randomized design with eight 
treatments and three repetitions. CON: control group of 
catfish without katuk leaf extract, turmeric powder, and 
number of hepatocytes, the functionality of each cell, 
and the availability of materials used to synthesize 
vitellogenin.
Curcuma longa supplementation can reduce the 
occurrence of oxidative stress, inflammation, and 
insulin resistance, which are important factors in 
the maintenance of liver health and the whole fish’s 
performance (Júnior et al., 2020; Abbas et al., 2021; 
Aminuddin et al., 2023). In addition, the safety of using 
C. longa in fish has been evaluated to provide more 
support for its potential applications in aquaculture 
(De Moraes França Ferreira et al., 2017). Abdelkhalek 
et al. (2021) reported that curcumin was able to reduce 
serum alanine aminotransferase activity, indicating a 
protective effect against liver function and oxidative 
stress markers in tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). Zhang 
et al. (2021) also reported that curcumin could maintain 
liver health in carp, and the antioxidant properties of 
curcumin contributed to liver health and performance 
improvement. Curcumin supplementation increases 
liver enzyme levels and reduces steatosis in patients 
with annon-alcoholic fatty liver disease (Nouri‐Vaskeh 
et al., 2020; Safari et al., 2023).
Katuk leaves contain sterol with estrogenic activity 
that stimulates vitellogenin synthesis by hepatocytes. 
The use of katuk leaves in the animals showed the 
phytoestrogenic activity. Curcumin supplementation 
improves the function of hepatocytes to synthesize 
vitellogenin (Dewi et al., 2018). Turmeric powder also 
has estrogenic activity that can stimulate vitellogenin 
synthesis in improved hepatocytes. Vitamin C (ascorbic 
acid) has also been implicated in hormonal regulation. 
It enhances the absorption and efficacy of various 
nutrients and may play a role in the synthesis and 
metabolism of steroid hormones, including estradiol. 
Studies have shown that vitamin C can influence the 
expression of enzymes involved in estrogen metabolism, 
potentially increasing estradiol levels (Gorkom et al., 
2019). Vitamin C’s antioxidant properties may also 
protect estrogen from oxidative degradation, further 
supporting its activity (Meng, 2023).
Physiological parameters and liver histology are 
indications of permanent destruction in exposed fish, 
implying the importance of liver health in fish (Topic 
Popovic et al., 2023). The liver is also a digestive and 
metabolism organs that is important in the growth 
and development of teleost fish (Ren et al., 2022) and 
oviparous animals. Use of turmeric powder, katuk 
extract, and vitamin C will improve liver performance 
to produce vitellogenin, which stimulates the disruption 
of hepatocytes. This discovery is important in liver 
physiology and health in general in oviparous animals.

was commercial feed for catfish mixed with katuk leaf 
extract, turmeric powder, and vitamin C, using one egg 
albumin in 1 kg of feed.
Parameters measurements
At the end of the experiment, the blood samples 
of experimental catfish were taken from the tail at a 
volume of 3 ml for each catfish, and then the collected 
blood samples were centrifuged at a speed of 3,000 rpm 
at temperature of 4 oC for 20 minutes then the serum 
was collected for measurement of concentrations of 
serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (SGPT), serum 
glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (SGOT), and 
superoxide dismutase (SOD). Concentrations of SGPT 
and SGOT indicate liver cell destruction. In contrast, 
the concentration of SOD indicates antioxidant activity. 
Catfish liver was isolated to measure the hepatosomatic 
index (HSI) and liver histology using hematoxylin 
eosin with a thickness of 5 µm at an enlargement of 
40×. Analysis of SGPT and SGOT was analyzed using 
the Reitman and Frankel Method. For the analysis of 
liver SOD concentrations, 1 g of sliced liver was used 
under cold conditions. The measurements of liver SOD 
concentrations were conducted to measure the activity 
of lipid peroxidation in the hepatocytes, which was 
obtained from TBA (tiobarbituric) method.
Water quality
In this experiment, water quality was measured to 
maintain the environmental conditions of the place 
where the experimental catfish was maintained. The 
experimental catfish were reared in controlled media 
for 8 weeks. The quality of the maintenance water is 
monitored daily. The catfish broodstock media used 
in each treatment group are presented in Table 1. The 
observation parameters were temperature, pH, and DO 
in the optimum range for the growth and reproduction 
of catfish.
Analysis data
The histology and liver pictures data were provided 
descriptively in the figures. Growth- and reproductive-
related data were collated in MS. Excel 2010 
(Microsoft, USA) and statistically evaluated using 
one-way ANOV A in SPSS ver. 25 (IBM, USA). The 
SD was determined to define the range of means, and 
the p value was set to 0.05 to test for significant results. 
Mean values were determined using Tukey’s test.
Ethical approval
All animal experiments were conducted under the 
guidelines of the animal ethics commission of the 
School of Veterinary Medicine and Biomedical 
Sciences, IPB University, number 059/KEH/SKE/
VI/2023 has approved procedures for handling and 
caring experimental animals.
Results
Body weight, liver weight, hepatosomatic index, and 
liver histology
Observation of body weight, liver weight, and HSI 
values at the end of 8 weeks of rearing of experimental 
catfish with the addition of katuk extract, turmeric 
powder, and vitamin C are presented in Table 2. The 
results observation of body weight were in the range 
of 2.21–2.29 kg, liver weights were in the range of 
23.13–30.27 g, and HSI values were in the range of 
1.01%–1.13%, and those results were statistically not 
significant among treatments. Even though the HSI of 
experimental catfish were not statistically different, the 
highest HSI value was found at SATU (combination of 
administration of katuk extract and turmeric powder) 
treatment with an average value of 1.13% ± 0.02%, 
and the lowest value was found at VC (administration 
of vitamin C) treatment with an average value of 
1.01% ± 0.03%.
Histological observation of the liver tissue of the 
experimental catfish was conducted to evaluate 
any indications of damage to the liver cells during 
the vitellogenesis process (Fig. 1). Histological 
examination of catfish liver tissue is essential in 
understanding fish’s reproductive dynamics and liver 
health. Compared with the liver tissue of catfish after 
the administration of katuk extract, turmeric powder, 
and vitamin C, hepatocyte cells experienced necrosis. 
In each treatment group, several cells experienced 
hepatocyte vacuolization (V AC), such as in the CON, 
SA, VC, and SA VC groups. In treatment with the 
addition of turmeric powder, many hepatocyte cells did 
not experience V AC. By supplementing feed with the 
addition of turmeric powder, the histological appearance 
showed that fewer cells experienced hepatocyte V AC. 
Based on statistical testing, the number of liver cells 
that experienced V AC showed a significant difference 
(p < 0.005) between treatments. The lowest number 
of V AC cells was observed in the SATU treatment 
3074

(7.67 ± 1.53), and the highest number was observed in 
the SA VC treatment (70.00 ± 8.72). This indicates that 
supplementing turmeric powder in the experimental 
catfish feed during vitellogenesis can improve liver cell 
functions and increase the synthesis capacity of liver 
cells to produce vitellogenin, which is the raw material 
for egg yolk formation in catfish larvae.
SOD, SGPT, and SGOT levels
The results of observations of SOD, SGPT, and SGOT 
levels in experimental catfish supplemented with katuk 
extract, turmeric powder, and vitamin C for 8 weeks 
are presented in Table 3. The results of statistical 
analysis showed that the addition of katuk extract, 
turmeric powder, and vitamin C was not significantly 
different (p > 0.05) on SOD and SGOT levels but had 
a significant effect (p < 0.05) on SGPT levels. Adding 
turmeric powder to each treatment group reduced 
the plasma SGOT and SGPT levels of the catfish 
compared to the control group without turmeric powder 
supplementation.
Based on the results of observations, the SOD value 
was found to be around 0.99–1.55 units/mg. The 
highest SOD levels were found in the treatment group 
with the addition of turmeric (TU) and the addition of 
TUVC at 1.55 units/mg, and the lowest was found in the 
treatment group with the addition of katuk extract and 
vitamin C (SA VC) at 0.99 units/mg. In the treatment 
group with the addition of turmeric powder, the SOD 
value was increased compared with that in the group 
without turmeric supplementation.
SGPT levels ranged from 15.00 to 38.33 units/mg. The 
lowest SGPT levels were found in the treatment group 
with the addition of TU, and the addition of TUVC 
was 15.00 units/mg, and the highest was found in the 
treatment group with the addition of katuk extract 
(SA) at the level of 38.33 units/mg. Statistically, all 
treatment groups with the addition of turmeric powder 
were significantly different (p < 0.05) compared to 
those without turmeric powder supplementation. 
The control group was not statistically significantly 
different (p > 0.05) in all treatment groups without 
turmeric supplementation.
Statistically, SGOT levels were not significantly 
different between the treatment groups, but they 
differed numerically. Based on these observations, the 
range of SGOT value is 171.67–284.00 units/mg. The 
lowest SGOT level in the treatment group with the 
addition of TU was 171.67 units/mg, and the highest 
was found in the treatment group with the addition of 
SA, that is, 284 units/mg. The SGOT levels were lower 
in each treatment group with the addition of turmeric 
than in the treatment group without turmeric powder.
Discussion
The HSI value is an indicator of the amount of energy 
reserves allocated for reproduction. The highest HSI 
value was found in the treatment group supplemented 
with katuk extract and turmeric powder in the feed 
(SATU), with an average of 1.13% compared with the 
other treatments. The HSI value tended to increase 
with each treatment; this is suspected to occur 
during vitellogenin synthesis. Fish liver contains 
high concentrations of estrogen receptors, which can 
synthesize large amounts of vitellogenin if stimulated 
by estrogen (Sumpter and Jobling, 1995). The increase 
in the HSI of catfish observed in this research can 
be applied to wild oviparous animals to support the 
reproduction process, to maintain a normal population, 
and biodiversity.
Turmeric has long been believed to be good for 
liver health and performance because it contains 
curcumin, which has hepatoprotective activity.

Turmeric also has potential in biological processes, 
including reproductive function in fish. Previous 
results (Dewi et al., 2018) showed that turmeric 
powder can improve reproductive performance in 
catfish and in the process of vitellogenesis and gonad 
development. In addition, phenolic compounds derived 
from C. longa have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant 
properties, which have implications for modulating 
physiological and biochemical processes related to 
reproductive function (Ghaneifar et al., 2020). It is 
essential to evaluate the suitability of turmeric as a fish 
feed and its overall impact on fish health, particularly 
reproduction. These turmeric effects can also be applied 
in all oviparous animals to improve liver function and 
support reproduction to maintain a stable population, 
especially in wild oviparous animals with reproduction 
problems, to maintain biodiversity.
The active compounds in turmeric have potential 
implications for increasing vitellogenin synthesis and 
liver function in fish to understand the mechanisms 
and potential impact of turmeric supplementation on 
reproduction and overall health. The SOD value in the 
treatment group of experimental catfish supplemented 
with turmeric powder increased, whereas the SGPT 
and SGOT content decreased. This result agrees 
with that reported by Mainassy et al. (2022), who 
found that supplementation of curcumin analogs in 
feed significantly increased SOD values and reduced 
SGPT and SGOT levels. Curcumin has been shown 
to modulate the expression of various enzymes and 
proteins involved in liver function, such as SOD, 
glutathione (GSH), and liver enzymes, such as SGPT 
and SGOT (Ciftci et al., 2011; Sehgal et al., 2012; Putra 
et al., 2018; He et al., 2022; Pawar et al., 2022). This 
evidence demonstrates that curcumin plays a role in 
regulating the action of enzymes in the liver, antioxidant 
activity, and various signaling pathways involved in 
liver health and disease. The hepatoprotective effects 
of this agent make it a candidate for preventing and 
treating liver disorders. These effects also have great 
potential for use in wild oviparous animals to maintain 
reproduction processes and support a stable population, 
and to maintain normal biodiversity.
Katuk leaves (Sauropus androgynus) contain 
secondary metabolite compounds such as sterol 
compounds, tannins, saponins, terpenoids, and phenols 
(Awaludin et al., 2020). Potential estrogenic effects 
on S. androgenus have an impact on the reproductive 
process, and katuk extract has direct and indirect effects 
on the reproductive system, which is related to estrogen 
receptors; apart from that, it also contains isoflavone 
compounds and acts as an agent similar to estrogen 
and phytoestrogen, which show potential estrogenic 
properties (Susilowati et al., 2020). Each treatment 
group, with the addition of katuk extract, showed high 
HSI values, which proves that the estrogen compounds 
contained in katuk extract stimulate the growth and 
development of the liver of catfish. Supplementation of 
an estrogenic compound to catfish feed will stimulate 
hepatocytes to synthesize and secrete vitellogenin, 
which will be used for ovary development and as 
raw material for egg yolk. Optimizing water quality 
parameters, such as temperature, pH, and DO, is 
essential to encourage optimum gonad development 
and successful reproduction of catfish and oviparous 
animals. According to Basiita and Rajts (2021), 
suitable parameters for growth and reproduction in 
catfish maintenance media are temperature 25℃–30℃, 
pH 6.5–8.5, and DO of >3 mg/l. These parameters 
play a role in creating an environment conducive to

Conclusion
Based on our research results, the addition of katuk 
extract, turmeric powder, and vitamin C to the 
broodstock feed can improve liver performance in 
synthesizing vitellogenin by reducing SGPT and 
SGOT levels, increasing SOD values, and reducing the 
number of cells undergoing vacuolation.
