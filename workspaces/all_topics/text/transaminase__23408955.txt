Abstract
Alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT) has been studied in a variety of organisms due to the involvement of this enzyme in
mammalian processes such as non-alcoholic hepatocellular damage, and in plant processes such as C4 photosynthesis, post-
hypoxic stress response and nitrogen use efficiency. To date, very few studies have made direct comparisons of AlaAT
enzymes and fewer still have made direct comparisons of this enzyme across a broad spectrum of organisms. In this study
we present a direct kinetic comparison of glutamate:pyruvate aminotransferase (GPAT) activity for seven AlaATs and two
glutamate:glyoxylate aminotransferases (GGAT), measuring the K
M values for the enzymes analyzed. We also demonstrate
that recombinant expression of AlaAT enzymes in Eschericia coli results in differences in bacterial growth inhibition,
supporting previous reports of AlaAT possessing bactericidal properties, attributed to lipopolysaccharide endotoxin
recognition and binding. A probable lipopolysaccharide binding region within the AlaAT enzymes, homologous to a region
of a lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) in humans, was also identified in this study. The AlaAT enzyme differences
identified here indicate that AlaAT homologues have differentiated significantly and the roles these homologues play
in vivo may also have diverged significantly. Specifically, the differing kinetics of AlaAT enzymes and how this may alter the
nitrogen use efficiency in plants is discussed.

Introduction
Alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT) [E.C. 2.6.1.2], also referred
to as glutamate:pyruvate aminotransferase (GPAT), is a pyridoxal-
59-phosphate-dependent (PLP) enzyme that catalyzes the revers-
ible transfer of an amino group from alanine to 2-oxoglutarate to
form glutamate and pyruvate [1,2]. AlaAT is widespread, with
homologues in all three biological domains ( Eukarya, Archaea and
Eubacteria) and functions as a part of several major metabolic
pathways. Existing in both the cytosol and the mitochondria,
AlaAT plays a critical role in linking carbon and nitrogen
metabolism (assimilation and catabolism) within both eukaryotes
and prokaryotes [3]. AlaAT is involved in a number of cellular
processes including glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, amino acid
metabolism [2], hepatocellular damage in mammals [4], photo-
respiration in plants [5] and nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) in
plants, including cereal crops [6,7,8]. This latter process is of
particular interest, as it has been previously shown that both
canola (Brassica napus) and rice ( Oryza sativa) plants over-expressing
barley ( Hordeum vulgare ) AlaAT (HvAlaAT) in a tissue-specific
manner have increased NUE under nitrogen (N) limiting
conditions, both in controlled environments and field trials for
rice [6,7,8]. Due to the increased awareness of the detrimental
effects of increased N fertilizers in the environment as well as the
concerns surrounding increasing world population and subsequent
food shortages, the ability to obtain increased yields under limiting
N fertilizer conditions is particularly important. Any further
understanding of the key enzymes involved in these processes may
be of significance in additional improvements in NUE [9,10,11].
To date, AlaAT enzymes and their kinetics have been
characterized in a variety of species. However most work on this
enzyme has focused on the medical implications of the AlaAT
isoforms found in humans (HsAlaAT) [12]. Increases of both
HsAlaAT1 (cytoplasmic) and HsAlaAT2 (mitochondrial) in
mammalian serum samples have shown to be reliable indicators
of liver damage, muscle damage and celiac disease [13].
Moreover, significant increases in activity of mouse ( Mus musculus)
mitochondrial AlaAT (MmAlaAT2), but not mouse cytoplasmic
AlaAT (MmAlaAT1) in fatty livers of obese mice, indicate possible
differences in the roles/effects these two isozymes have in the cell.
The evolution of differences in the kinetics of various isozymes of
AlaAT would be driven in part by the distinct cellular roles these
isozymes play [4].
Good et al., [7] and Shrawat et al., [8] observed a nitrogen use
efficient (NUE) phenotype in plants with over-expression of the
HvAlaAT enzyme in canola and rice, respectively, using a tissue
specific promoter. However, the specific basis for this phenotype
remains unclear and there is a continued effort to understand the
intracellular mechanisms which cause this phenotype. One
question of particular interest is whether different AlaAT enzyme
isoforms have different kinetics and if so, could these different
isoforms favor an NUE phenotype? More specifically, are there
optimal kinetic properties of AlaAT which can produce an
increase in NUE when expressed within plants? Given that the
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 February 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 2 | e55032
previous NUE phenotypes were observed in canola and rice
utilizing a promoter which increased expression in the roots [14],
the benefits of targeting the expression of a gene of interest to a
particular tissue have become clear. For example, genes involved
in producing modified oils are usually expressed with a seed
specific promoter [15]. What has been less studied is the
importance of choosing an enzyme that works with optimal
efficiency in the appropriate environment and tissue. The
importance of studying enzyme variants is illustrated by the
example of Golden Rice. Development of this rice involved the
insertion of a daffodil phytoene synthase ( psy) gene for the efficient
production of ß-carotene, a product used to synthesize Vitamin A
[16]. A number of psy genes were analyzed in order to determine
which produced the highest levels of ß-carotene, and which variant
was rate-limiting; further analysis revealed that an even more
efficient psy gene may exist in maize (‘‘Golden Rice 2’’) [16].
Therefore, identifying enzyme variants that overcome a metabolic
bottle-neck could prove to be an effective strategy for trait
improvement.
To investigate further the basis for an increased NUE
phenotype, we chose to evaluate different enzyme variants of
AlaAT with a view to using these variants to gain insights into the
underlying metabolic changes that affect NUE in plants. Because
AlaAT has an equilibrium constant near one, the reaction of this
enzyme in vivo will be driven by substrate concentrations [17].
Therefore, it follows that an AlaAT homologue with increased
specificity or different kinetic properties could allow for increased
NUE properties in a plant system. This approach was recently
taken by Duff et al., who examined the kinetic properties and
crystal structure of different AlaAT enzyme variants [17]. Here we
present a kinetic comparison of AlaAT enzymes from a broader
variety of organisms, placing emphasis on the difference in K
M
values between homologues enzymes instead of the specific activity
of the enzyme which has been analyzed elsewhere [17].
Furthermore, AlaAT enzymes used in this analysis were not
tagged as has been done previously, which can affect enzyme
activity. Finally, only L-amino acid enzymes were used in this
analysis given that many plant pathways are L-enantiomer
stereospecific, including shikimate, aspartate, pyruvate and gluta-
mate [18], and that a very small percent ( ,0.5–3) of the total
amino acids within many plants are not of the L-type [19]. To our
knowledge, this is the most comprehensive kinetic analysis of
AlaAT homologues. We show that AlaAT homologues and two
glutamate: aminotransferase (GGAT) enzymes (which have
secondary glutamate:pyruvate aminotransferase activity) have
relative K
M values for co-substrates that indicate that in vivo the
rate and direction of the reaction catalyzed by each enzyme, under
similar substrate concentrations, may differ dramatically. These
results reaffirm the results obtained by Duff et al., [17] for some of
the variants tested with the addition of K
M values for eight
AlaAT’s not studied previously. The effects of various enzymes
with diverging kinetic behaviours were also assessed for functional
consequences in E. coli under different environmental conditions.
Results and Discussion
Homologous AlaAT Primary Sequence Comparison
Glutamate:pyruvate aminotransferases (AlaAT/GPAT) and
glutamate:glyoxylate aminotransferases (GGAT) are subgroup I
aminotransferases, containing eleven invariant residues essential
for binding the coenzyme PLP and for stabilizing the enzyme:sub-
strate transition state [1,5]. Both AlaAT and GGAT enzymes
share similar primary and secondary structures, as well as
hydropathy with other subgroup I aminotransferases such as
aspartate aminotransferase and tyrosine aminotransferase [1]. All
13 enzymes examined in this study showed this conservation and
maintained the 11 invariant residues previously defined for
subgroup I aminotransferases (see Ward et al., 2000 [20]) (Figure
S1). Primary sequence analysis (Figure 1) indicates that of the
sequences studied, P. furiosus (PfAlaAT) is the most divergent,
which is not surprising considering this was the only non-
eukaryotic sequence examined. Interestingly, the protein sequenc-
es of AtGGAT1 and AtGGAT2 are more similar to plant AlaAT
enzymes than are mammalian and archaean AlaAT enzymes to
plant homologues, even though GGAT enzymes are capable of
both glutamate:glyoxylate and glutamate:pyruvate aminotransfer-
ase reactions [5]. It appears that the kinetic differences identified
here are due to differences in non-conserved residues which may
cause changes in substrate binding affinity and/or catalytic rate,
perhaps as a result of changes in enzyme folding.
AlaAT Enzymes have Varying Substrate KM Values
KM values from eight AlaAT and two GGAT enzymes are
compared in Table 1. Although K M values for several of the
enzymes analyzed here have been reported previously, our study
facilitates a comparison of data obtained with a single assay
system. To date, most studies on AlaAT have been organism and
tissue-specific, focusing on a single enzyme or isozymes, making
comparisons between AlaAT enzymes from different species
difficult. Comparisons between enzymes have also been limited
due to purification and expression differences, as in the case of
AtGGAT1. The AlaAT activity of this enzyme has been examined
by purification of this protein from both shoot tissues [21] and
recombinant E. coli [5]. These differences in enzyme source and
purification procedure can manifest as alterations in enzymatic
kinetic behaviour, compounded by differences in the assay
conditions used during kinetic analyses [20,22,23]. Other errors
may result from the presence of homologous proteins which were
not separated from the AlaAT of interest during purification, due
to similar biochemical properties and increases in activity from
environmental changes (e.g. greening of leaves) [24]. Due to these
confounding factors, kinetic data obtained with enzymes from
various sources cannot be reliably compared across different
studies (Table 2).
K
M values reported here indicate significant diversity between
the different enzymes for the same substrates. Between AtAlaAT1
(cytoplasmic) and AtAlaAT2 (mitochondrial) the minimal K M
discrepancy between substrates was reported for glutamate, with
an approximate two-fold increase in K M (2.5 mM to 4.9 mM
respectively) (Table 1). The K M values obtained from both M.
truncatula proteins were similar for all substrates, the greatest
difference being seen for the substrate glutamate, with a three-fold
change in K
M (0.1 mM for MtAlaAT1, 0.3 mM for MtAlaAT2).
The largest difference between substrates for a single enzyme was
seen for PfAlaAT. For this enzyme, there was an 825-fold
difference between K
M values for 2-oxoglutarate and pyruvate
(0.02 mM and 16.5 mM respectively). The second largest
difference in K
M values for a given enzyme between substrates
was seen for MmAlaAT, with a 265-fold difference (seen between
the K
M values for alanine and 2-oxoglutarate, 26.5 mM and
0.1 mM, respectively). No groupings or patterns could be
established among the K M values obtained, and relative differ-
ences were not consistent for a single enzyme and multiple
substrates, or for the K
M values of multiple enzymes for a single
substrate. KM values for 2-oxoglutarate appeared to be reasonably
constant (difference in K M values of 8.78 mM) with AtGGAT2
having a K M of 8.8 mM. The next largest value belonged to
AtAlaAT2, with a KM for 2-oxoglutarate of 1.0 mM. The range of
Kinetic Analysis of Alanine Aminotransferase

KM values for alanine, pyruvate and glutamate were much greater
(differences in K Ms of 26.2 mM, 12.9 mM and 18.5 mM
respectively).
The K M values reported here for HvAlaAT and ScAlaAT1
share some similarity to those recently reported by Duff et al., [17],
with the largest difference between values being the K M for
ScAlaAT1 and the substrate pyruvate, here reported as a K M of
11.0 and previously reported as a KM of 0.4, a 27.5 fold difference.
All other KM’s for the remaining substrates alanine, 2-oxoglutarate
and glutamate showed lower fold differences when K M values for
ScAlaAT were compared, 12, 2.5 and 2.9 respectively. The K M
values reported for HvAlaAT did not show as great a deviation
between studies for the various substrates with, 6.7, 1.1, 9.1 and
2.1 fold differences for alanine, 2-oxoglutarate, glutamate and
pyruvate respectively. These discrepancies in K
M values could be
the result of numerous protocol differences as outlined above, and
re-emphasize the importance of obtaining enzymatic data from a
single source for the purpose of direct comparisons.
V
max values for all enzymes assayed are presented in Table S1.
Since enzyme fractions were not purified, the concentrations of the
enzymes used, and thus catalytic rate constants are unknown,
therefore the usefulness of V
max values in making meaningful
comparisons between different enzymes is diminished. Purification
of individual proteins in order to establish enzyme concentrations,
thereby allowing determination of k
cat and comparison of V max,
was not done due to the absence of an antibody that would
specifically bind each of the different variants for purification
purposes. Furthermore, enzymes were not tagged with either His
or Myc-C sequences since such alterations may affect enzyme
kinetics. Given that these were recombinant proteins expressed in
a bacterial system, protein folding may have been altered affecting
kinetic results. Since whole protein fractions were utilized during
this study, the possibility that enzyme inhibitors were present or
that non-AlaAT transaminase activities may have contributed to
substrate turnover as well as NAD/NADH concentrations and
influenced calculated kinetic constants must be considered.
It is therefore of interest to determine the effects on NUE
phenotypes of AlaAT enzymes that display kinetics similar to those
of HvAlaAT, compared with enzymes that have very different
characteristics. Based on the results from the kinetic assays,
AtAlaAT1 appears to be most similar to HvAlaAT. Both AtAlaAT
enzymes have higher K
M values for glutamate and alanine, and
lower KM values for 2-oxoglutarate and pyruvate, compared with
HvAlaAT. MmAlaAT1 has rather different KM values, raising the

possibility of a distinct in vivo role(s). Compared with other AlaATs
examined, this enzyme had the highest KM values for both alanine
(26.5 mM) and glutamate (13.0 mM).
It is difficult to extrapolate in vitro kinetic data and predict the
consequences of altered substrate KM values, without knowing the
cellular concentrations of substrates under various environmental
conditions. For example, while MmAlaAT appears to display very
different kinetic behavior compared with HvAlaAT, in vivo analysis
will be needed in order to verify whether or not such differences
have any effect on plant phenotype when the gene is ectopically
expressed. Alanine and glutamic acid concentrations in rice seeds
show average millimolar amounts of alanine as ,0.57 mM and
glutamic acid as ,1.53 mM, with vitamin B 6, a precursor to the
AlaAT cofactor PLP, at ,0.72 mM [25]. Other studies conducted
by Narsai et al., [26] show that in rice seedlings these concentra-
tions are altered during the growth and development of the plant
and are approximately 0.09 mM for glutamate, 2.27 mM for
alanine, 0.79 mM for pyruvate and 0.65 mM for 2-oxoglutarate.
The changes in AlaAT substrate concentrations during different
phases of plant growth and in various cellular tissues and organs
has also been documented elsewhere [27]. Aminotransferase
enzymes with overlapping functions have also been observed in a
number of organisms, including E. coli [28], P. furiosus [20] and
plants [17,29]. The effect of any of these enzymes on nitrogen
uptake or metabolism can only be speculated upon and would
require whole plants studies and in vivo analysis which are
currently underway. Analysis of the kinetics of aspartate amino-
transferase (AspAT) from higher plants has also been carried out
recently with similar intentions of crop improvement [30].
AlaAT Homologues Differ in their Ability to Reduce
Growth Rate of Gram Negative Bacteria
As an initial screen to determine if the presence of a specific
AlaAT variant in E. coli had a significant effect on the bacteria’s
ability to utilize specific substrates, E. coli expressing the various
AlaAT enzymes from plasmid constructs were grown in modified
M63 medium supplemented with various concentrations of 2-
oxoglutarate, with ammonium as the nitrogen source. It was
speculated that 2-oxoglutarate might have an effect on the growth
rates of E. coli due to its central role in linking both carbon and
nitrogen metabolism in bacteria [31,32,33,34]. Furthermore,
excess 2-oxoglutarate in the growth medium may have a
significant impact on AlaAT enzymes with lower K
M values for
both alanine and 2-oxoglutarate, if substrate k cat values of these
enzymes are not also lower and assuming that substrates are
present at sub-saturating concentrations. It was hoped that
changes in the availability of AlaAT substrate(s) (2-oxoglutarate)
during growth of E. coli over-expressing various AlaAT homo-
logues would allow for differentiation of homologous enzymes in
terms of substrate usage, manifest phenotypically as changes in
rates of growth. For the reasons outlined below, we were unable to
characterize the transgenic E. coli in terms of changes to available
substrate concentrations however the results indicate that AlaAT
may maintain novel functions within Eukarya, Archaea and
Eubacteria. Whether these functions play a role in plant NUE has
yet to be explored. Ultimately, no difference in growth rate of E.
coli containing HvAlaAT was observed when exposed to concen-
trations of 2-oxoglutarate (Figure 2). However we did observe a
slow growth phenotype in all E. colicultures expressing the various
AlaAT constructs (Figure 2 and Figure 3).
Expression of recombinant AlaAT from B. japonicus (AmphiALT),
in gram-negative E. coli has been shown to cause cell lysis through
lipopolysaccharide (LPS) binding [35]. Jing and Zhang (2011) [35]
observed that AmphiALT was able to bind and lyse gram-negative

KM values obtained during this study were compared with previous KM values from various published sources. Discrepancies between kinetic values can be attributed partially to differences in procedure as well as differences in
original data collection. Nevertheless, significant differences in KM values for all enzymes are evident. Variation amongst results highlights the benefit of using one system and one procedure when comparing kinetic data from
several different enzymes. (NA = no data available from previous studies.).

but not gram-positive cells; binding was reported to be specific to
the LPS region. From these results it was suggested that AlaAT
may also be involved in the acute phase response, particularly in
liver tissues. Our study supports this view, indicating that
recombinant expression of AlaAT in E. coli inhibits growth, and
decreases cell growth rates when grown in minimal medium
(Figure 3 and Figure 4). Due to the absence of antibodies for all
AlaAT enzymes and thus an inability to purify individual AlaATs,
direct binding of E. coliLPS to the various AlaAT enzymes was not
examined. However, slow growth phenotypes similar to those
described previously in the presence of AlaAT were observed,
leading to the conclusion that all of the AlaAT enzymes studied
exhibit some bactericidal activity similar to AmphiALT from B.
japonicus, and providing evidence for the conservation of AlaAT
bactericidal properties. In order to clarify, the growth curves of
only five of the ten AlaATs expressed in E. coli are shown in
Figure 3. E. coli cells expressing AtAlaAT2, MtAlaAT, ScAlaAT and
MmAlaAT1 showed growth curves similar to those obtained with
AtAlaAT1.
Among the ten enzymes assayed, inhibition of growth rate
varied significantly. PfAlaAT showed the greatest effect on growth
rate over time, seen most clearly in Figure 4, when the first
derivative of each sample is determined. Both AtGGAT2 and
AtGGAT1 also show dramatic decreases in growth rate over time
(Figure 4). Comparison of kinetic constants for a particular enzyme
with growth assay results has not provided any insights into the
reasons for these differences in growth rates. Also interesting was
the observed change in the growth rate of the bacteria containing
the HvAlaAT over time (Figure 4). While a constant or slight
increase in growth rate was observed with the majority of proteins
assayed, the over-expression of HvAlaAT resulted in a substantial
decrease in growth rate starting at approximately 2 hours and
continuing until approximately 7 hrs, at which point growth rate
once again began to increase.
To investigate further the bactericidal activity of AlaAT, the
primary structure of each enzyme was analyzed for a conserved
endotoxin binding region. Through analysis of the known LPS
region from human lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) [36],

a similar conserved region was found to various extents in all
AlaAT enzymes (Figure 5). PfAlaAT shows the greatest conser-
vation of the LPS binding region, with the highest number of
residues conserved, and a percent identity of 26% (Figure 5A).
PfAlaAT was also the most effective isoform inhibiting growth of
E. coli (Figure 4). AtGGAT1 and AtGGAT2 also show a high
degree of conservation of identical residues, with percent identities
of 22% (Figure 5B). All sequences show a high degree of
conservative and semi-conservative sequence similarity, for exam-
ple with AtAlaAT1, AtAlaAT2, MtAlaAT and HvAlaAT
(Figure 5C), HsAlaAT1, HsAlaAT2, MmAlaAT1 and MmA-
laAT2 (Figure 5D), and ScAlaAT1 and ScAlaAT2 (Figure 5E).
However the ability of these enzymes to bind the LPS region of E.
coli and inhibit growth was not as pronounced as that observed for
PfAlaAT, AtGGAT1 and AtGGAT2, perhaps demonstrating the
importance of a high level of conservation of sequences/residues at
these sites. The possibility that other conserved endotoxin binding
regions may exist to varying degrees in the AlaAT homologues
analyzed should also be considered as this could also contribute to
the variation of growth inhibition observed. Given the evidence
that AlaAT enzymes may be playing a role in acute phase response
to bacterial infections in vivo [35], determining how these
differences affect, or are affected by concentration-dependent
binding of other molecules within the cell will be important to
develop a more complete understanding of enzyme function.
Conclusion
A kinetic examination of the enzyme alanine aminotransferase
is of interest for a number of reasons. AlaAT has been shown to be
involved in stress responses in numerous plants, including cereal
crops [2,22,37], while in mammals, this enzyme is used as an
indicator of non-alcoholic hepatocellular liver damage [13] and
may be involved in immune system acute phase response [35].
Recently, AlaAT has been shown to increase NUE in cereal crops
when over-expressed with a tissue specific promoter [6,8]. The
kinetic results presented here indicate that catalytic properties
between AlaAT homologues differ considerably. Our data reveal
that when AlaAT is over-expressed in plant systems, various
phenotypic results with respect to changes in NUE may be
observed. Previous analysis in Brassica napus and rice has already
determined the importance of using a tissue-specific promoter in
obtaining an NUE phenotype [6,7,8,38,39]. Preliminary studies in
our group indicate that Arabidopsis thaliana over-expressing several
of the different AlaAT enzymes with differing kinetics can produce
novel phenotypes. The knowledge of enzyme variants gained here,
as well as prior knowledge of promoters provides a platform for
future NUE studies and the improvement of crop nutrient
utilization.

(Hordeum vulgare, HvAlaAT) (GenBank accession no. Z26322) was
obtained from a cDNA originally used in our over-expression
studies [8] and was described by Muench and Good (1994) [40].
Both Medicago truncatula cDNA sequences were obtained from Anis
Limami at the Universite ´ d’ Angers [41]. Although only one
naturally-occurring mitochondrial Medicago truncatula alanine ami-
notransferase ( MtAlaAT) has been described ( Medicago truncatula
genome sequencing resources, Medtr8g023140), none of the
sequences received were identical to the expected sequence, and
so two of the most similar sequences were chosen to be expressed
and analyzed. MtAlaAT1 contained the point mutation I144V
while MtAlaAT2 contained the point mutation F177S. Pyrococcus
furiosus AlaAT (PfAlaAT) (GenBank accession no. NP_579226) was
amplified from ATCC gDNA (DSM 3638). Arabidopsis thaliana
AlaAT1 (AtAlaAT1) (TAIR reference no. AtG17290) and AlaAT2
(AtAlaAT2) (TAIR reference no. At1G72330) sequences were
obtained from Yo Miyashita [2]. Yeast ( Saccharomyces cerevisiae )
sequences ( ScAlaAT1, GenBank accession no. NP_013190 and
ScAlaAT2, Genbank accession no. NP_010396) were amplified
from ATCC gDNA (S288C [MUCL 38902]). Arabidopsis thaliana
AtGGAT1 (TAIR reference no. At1G23310) and AtGGAT2 (TAIR
reference no. At1G70580) ( glutamate:glyoxylate aminotransferase ) se-
quences were obtained from Laura Olsen at the University of
Michigan [5]. Mouse ( Mus musculus ) MmAlaAT1 (GenBank
accession no. NP_877957) and MmAlaAT2 (GenBank accession
no. NP_776291) sequences were acquired from Rong ze Yang at
the University of Maryland [13], as were those for human ( Homo
sapien) HsAlaAT1 (GenBank accession no. NP_005300) and
HsAlaAT2 (GenBank accession no. NP_597700). All genes were
sequenced and the primers used for sequencing are listed in Table
S2. When available, sequences were compared with BLAST
results from the NCBI nucleotide database.
All of the sequences were cloned into the E. coli expression
vector pBAD18-Kan using primers containing approximately

containing each of the different AlaATs and the controls over time.E. coliexpressing AtAlaAT2, MtAlaAT, ScAlaAT1 and MmAlaAT1 showed changes in
the rate of growth over the 26 hour time period similar to that seen byArabidopsis thaliana AlaAT1expressing cells.

22 bps of AlaAT specific gene sequence and a restriction digest cut
site at the 5 9 end (Table S2). Forward primers contained cut sites
for either Kpn1 or Sac1, while Xba1 cut sites were used for the
reverse primers. These constructs were transformed into E. coli
TR61 strain K-12 cells and used for AlaAT expression, activity and
kinetic assays. TR61 cells are derived from the E. coli K-12 strain
MC4100, containing a lac reporter gene on a lambda phage
insertion and a Tn10 insertion conferring resistance to the sugar
arabinose, and were a gift from Tracy Ravio at the University of
Alberta. TR61 cells are a previously unpublished de novo cell line
and permission for their use was granted by Tracy Ravio and the
Biosafety Committee, University of Alberta.
Analysis of AlaAT Primary Structure
Thirteen enzymes with AlaAT activity were obtained for
expression studies and kinetic analysis and the amino acid
sequences were compared using ClustalW software (full primary
sequence comparison is provided in Figure S1). The Medicago
truncatula sequence utilized for this analysis was obtained from Anis
Limami at the Universite´ d’ Angers [41]. Vector NTI Advance v.
11.0 software was used to construct a dendrogram (Figure 1). For
both ClustalW and Vector NTI analysis, a gap open penalty of 10
and a gap extension penalty of 0.05 were used. The percent
identity of amino acid sequences was defined by dividing the
number of identical residues by the number of amino acids in the
shortest sequence; gaps were not taken into account.
Induction of AlaAT Constructs inE. coli
Five hundred mLo f E. coli TR61 overnight cultures containing
the various AlaAT constructs were added to 45 mL LB and grown
at 37uC, to an OD600 of 0.5–0.75, at which point 20 mL of culture
was added separately to two flasks, one of which received
arabinose to a final concentration of 0.2%. Both induced and
uninduced cultures were incubated, shaking at 37 uC for an
additional 4 hrs. Induced and uninduced cultures were harvested
by centrifugation after 3–4 hrs, washed a single time with STE
buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH = 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl),
and bacterial pellets were flash frozen and stored at 280uC.
Cultures were stored at 280uC for no more than 2 weeks prior to
protein extraction.
Protein Extraction
Whole protein fractions were extracted using a freeze-thaw
method. Cells were re-suspended in 2 mL protein extraction
buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl pH = 7.5, 5 mM EDTA) containing
1 mM DTT and 1 mM PMSF. Ten
mL of 10% Triton-X100 and
10 mL of 1 mg/mL lysozyme (Sigma, L-6876) were added to
resuspended cells and incubated at room temperature for 15–
30 min. Protein was extracted through six cycles of freeze-thaw

using liquid nitrogen. Samples were then centrifuged and the
supernatant from each cell fraction was removed and applied to a
PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare, Sephadex G-25 M, PD-
10 Columns). The eluate from these columns was used for both
AlaAT activity measurements and kinetics assays.
Activity Assays
Extracts were tested for glutamate:pyruvate aminotransferase
(GPAT) activity prior to kinetic assays to ensure the induction of
AlaAT expression. Varying dilutions of the AlaAT/GGAT protein
extractions were assayed alongside the uninduced protein fractions
to ensure the presence and activity of the AlaAT/GGAT enzymes.
Leaky expression of AlaAT in the uninduced protein fractions was
regularly observed, but at very low levels. Activity assays were also
conducted in order to determine the optimal degree of dilution of
the enzyme necessary for kinetic assays; these typically ranged
between 30X–40X. Activity assays were prepared and carried out
at 20 uC in the direction alanine and 2-oxoglutarate to pyruvate
and glutamate. Activity of AlaAT enzyme was determined using a
continuous coupled reaction catalyzed by lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH, Sigma, L-2518), with the change in absorbance associated
with generation of NAD
+ from NADH monitored at 340 nm.
Assays, done in 96 well microplates (UV-Star, VWR, 82050-788),
were initiated by the addition of 10
mL of protein extracts,
including the undiluted fraction (maximal activity of sample before
dilution) and the undiluted uninduced (negative control) protein
samples, to 290 mL of an AlaAT assay buffer (0.1 M Tris-HCl
pH 8.0 at 20 uC, 10 mM 2-oxoglutarate, 670 mM alanine,
0.27 mg ml 21 NADH, 0.36 U LDH, 10 mM pyridoxal-5 9-
phosphate (PLP)) such that the final reaction volume was
300 mL per well. The change in absorbance at 340 nm was
monitored continuously for 10 min in a SpectraMax Plus
absorbance plate reader (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).
Kinetic Assays
Kinetic assays were run for both sets of AlaAT substrates, with
the concentration of one substrate varied while the other was held
constant at a saturating concentration, for 10 of the 13 constructs.
Kinetic data were not obtained for MmAlaAT2-pBAD18-Kan,
ScAlaAT2-pBAD18-Kan, HsAlaAT1-pBAD18-Kan, or HsA-
laAT2-pBAD18-Kan as activity of these constructs was not
detected in initial assays. We believe that this inability to detect
activity was the result of inclusion body formation with these
proteins in E. coli.
Enzyme activity at each substrate concentration was assayed at
20uC in triplicate, over a concentration range( < 0.36K
M–86KM)
chosen based on previously published values and preliminary
kinetic assessments. To each well, 10 mL of diluted AlaAT protein
sample were added, along with 20 or 50 mL of substrate, and
kinetic assay buffer to a final volume of 300 mL. When AlaAT
activity was measured in the direction alanine to pyruvate, the
kinetic assay buffer consisted of either alanine (100 mM) or 2-
oxoglutarate (10 mM), 0.1 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.27 mg
ml
21 NADH, 10 mM PLP and 0.36 U LDH. When activity in
the direction of pyruvate to alanine was measured, the assay buffer
contained either pyruvate (10 mM) or glutamate (50 mM), 0.1 M
Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 100 mM NH
4Cl, 0.27 mg ml 21 NADH,
10 mM PLP and 1.14 U glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH, Sigma,
G-2501). The change in absorbance at 340 nm was monitored
continuously for 6–10 min in a SpectraMax Plus platereader. The
initial pseudo-linear portion of each absorbance-time plot was
analyzed by linear regression (SoftMax Pro v. 3.0) to obtain initial
rates. Thereafter, plots of initial rate versus [substrate] were fitted to
the Michaelis-Menten equation by nonlinear regression (Graph-
Pad Prism v. 5.03) to determine K
M and Vmax values (Figure S2).
Escherichia Coli Growth Assays
E. coli TR61 cells containing various pBAD18-Kan: AlaAT or
pBAD18-Kan:GGAT constructs were assayed for growth over
26 hrs. One mL of an overnight starter culture grown in LB
medium was added to 100 mL of modified M63 minimal medium
containing 0.2% glycerol, 0.2% arabinose, 50
mgm L21 kanamy-
cin and chloramphenicol at 25 mgm L21. Bacterial cultures were
then grown in flasks at 37 uC for 26 hrs. After 4 hrs of growth all
cultures were re-inoculated with 0.1% arabinose. The OD 600 was
recorded at 1–4 hr intervals through 14 hrs of growth and then
again at 26 hrs for induced cultures, untransformed controls,
empty vector controls, and uninduced controls containing a
pBAD18-Kan:HvAlaAT.
TR61 cells containing an empty pBAD18-Kan vector as well as
TR61 cells containing pBAD18-Kan: HvAlaAT were also assayed
for growth differences in M63 liquid minimal medium, supple-
mented as described above, containing 2-oxoglutarate at different
concentrations (Figure 2). Cell growth under these conditions was
also assayed for a total of 26 hrs, with measurements taken every
1–3 hrs for the first 14 hrs and then again at 26 hrs.
