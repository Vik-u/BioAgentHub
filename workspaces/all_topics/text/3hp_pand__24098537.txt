Abstract
Cyanobacteria are valuable organisms for studying the physiology of photosynthesis and carbon fixation, as well as
metabolic engineering for the production of fuels and chemicals. This work describes a novel counter selection
method for the cyanobacterium Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 based on organic acid toxicity. The organic acids
acrylate, 3-hydroxypropionate, and propionate were shown to be inhibitory towards Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002
and other cyanobacteria at low concentrations. Inhibition was overcome by a loss of function mutation in the gene
acsA, which is annotated as an acetyl-CoA ligase. Loss of AcsA function was used as a basis for an acrylate counter
selection method. DNA fragments of interest were inserted into the acsA locus and strains harboring the insertion
were isolated on selective medium containing acrylate. This methodology was also used to introduce DNA fragments
into a pseudogene, glpK. Application of this method will allow for more advanced genetics and engineering studies in
Synechococcus sp. PCC 7002 including the construction of markerless gene deletions and insertions. The acrylate
counter-selection could be applied to other cyanobacterial species where AcsA activity confers acrylate sensitivity
(e.g. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803).

Introduction
Current research concerning the physiology of cyanobacteria
has led to an increased understanding of photosynthesis, CO 2
fixation, and metabolism [ 1–3]. In addition to basic science,
researchers are also exploring the application of cyanobacteria
for the production of biofuels and chemicals [ 4,5]. Continued
advances in these areas will require more efficient methods for
genetic manipulation and gene expression [ 6,7]. In particular,
counter selection methods that are applicable to multiple
strains of cyanobacteria would be useful in dealing with the
issues of multiple chromosomes and limited antibiotic
resistance cassettes. Currently, a sacB counter selection
system was demonstrated in a glucose tolerant strain of
Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (PCC 6803) and a mazF based
system in wild type PCC 6803 [ 8,9]. Unfortunately, attempts to
build a sacB counter selection system have been unsuccessful
and mazF has not been demonstrated in Synechococcus sp.
PCC 7002 (PCC 7002), another model organism that grows
rapidly and is widely tolerant to light intensity, temperature and
salt conditions. Due to these advantages, PCC 7002 has
recently been explored for the production of α-olefins and
sugars via metabolic engineering [10,11].
Since a counter selection system was not available for PCC
7002, we developed a new system based on sensitivity to
organic acids. In general, organic acids can cause toxicity by
depleting proton motive force, accumulating anions, and
inhibiting enzymes [12–14]. The organic acids of interest in this
work are acrylate, 3-hydroxypropionate, and propionate.
Acrylate was shown to inhibit beta oxidation in Pseudomonas
and Ralstonia species, 3-hydroxypropionate was shown to
inhibit the chorismate pathway in Escherichia coli , and
propionate was shown to inhibit gluconeogenesis via
metabolism to 2-methylcitrate in Salmonella [15–18].
Additionally, exposure to propionate was shown to cause a
decrease in the free Coenzyme-A (CoA) pool in a species of
Synechococcus [19].

This work demonstrates that these three organic acids,
acrylate, 3-hydroxypropionate, and propionate, are inhibitory to
multiple species of cyanobacteria at low concentrations. This
inhibition can be overcome in PCC 7002 by a single loss of
function mutation in a gene encoding a CoA-ligase ( acsA).
These observations were used as a basis for the development
of a counter selection system using acrylate sensitivity.
Acrylate was chosen amongst the organic acids due to its
inhibitory activity in multiple species and dramatically increased
tolerance in strains without AcsA activity. This counter selection
method was used to directly introduce and select for
integrations into the acsA locus, as well as generate a scarless
integration in a neutral locus. The ability to rapidly introduce
heterologous gene constructs and make markerless deletions
will advance both basic science and applied research efforts in
cyanobacteria.
Materials and Methods
Chemicals and 3-hydroxypropionate quantification
Acrylate was purchased from MP Biomedicals (ICN211387).
3-hydroxypropionate was purchased from TCI America
(H0297) as a ca. 3.6 mol/L solution in water. Additional
chemicals and reagents were purchased from Fisher Scientific
and Sigma Aldrich. The 3-hydroxypropionate solution
purchased from TCI had an unknown purity, so the solution
was quantified with an enzyme assay using propionyl-CoA
synthase. Escherichia coli  (E. coli ) BL21 harboring pKS1
(expressing propionyl-CoA synthase) was grown in lysogeny
broth (LB) to an OD 600 of 0.4 and induced with 0.4 mM
isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The induced
culture was incubated at 30 °C for 4 h before centrifugation.
The resulting cell pellet was resuspended in twice the volume
of 100 mM Tris pH 7.8 and lysed by sonication. The cell debris
was removed by centrifugation at 16,000 x g for 10 min at 4 °C.
The supernatant was incubated at 63 °C for 10 min and the
precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation at 20,000 x
g. The resulting protein fraction was concentrated 2X using an
Amicon Ultra-4 centrifugation column to increase activity. The
resulting enzyme was used in an assay to quantify 3-HP by
NAPH reduction as described in Schneider et al [20].
Strains, culturing conditions, and media
All strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. PCC 7002,
Synechococcus sp. PCC 7942 (PCC 7942), and PCC 6803
were obtained from the Pasteur Culture Collection. PCC 7002
was grown in Medium A + pH 8.0 [ 21]. PCC 7942 and PCC
6803 were grown in BG-11 [ 22]. Unless otherwise noted, liquid
cultures were grown in 10 mL volumes at a light intensity of
140 µE/m2/s at 35 °C and bubbled with air. Agar plates were
incubated under the same light and temperature conditions.
Cultures used to observe the initial mutant population ( Figure
1) and harvest RNA were grown in 50 mL volumes without
agitation or supplementation with air. Cultures were inoculated
using patches grown from a single colony on solid media under
the same conditions. Unless otherwise noted, cell growth was
monitored by measuring the optical density at 730nm (OD 730)
using a Spectrophotometer 20 (Milton Roy).
Determining minimum inhibitory concentrations
Inocula were prepared by growing cultures of wild type and
mutant cyanobacteria to an OD 730 of 0.3. These cultures were
used to inoculate, to an initial OD 730 of 0.03, a 96 well plate
containing buffered media with increased concentrations of the
compound of interest. Stocks of the compounds of interest
were prepared in Medium A + and adjusted to a pH of 8.0. Wild
type PCC 7002 was challenged with organic acid concentration
increments of 5 µM for acrylate and 1 mM for 3-
hydroxypropionate and propionate. Mutant strains with
increased tolerance were further challenged with concentration
increments of 10 mM acrylate, 5 mM 3-hydroxypropionate, and
100 mM propionate. Plates were incubated at 35 °C at a light
intensity of 140 µE/m 2/s. OD 730 was measured periodically
using a plate reader (Tecan M1000). The minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) was determined as the concentration at
which no increase in OD730 was observed after 48 h.
Quantification of mutation frequency
Wild type PCC 7002 was grown to an OD 730 of 1.0 and
serially diluted in triplicate on both unmodified and acrylate-
containing plates. Acrylate concentrations of 50 µM, 500 µM, 5
mM, and 50 mM were used. Plates were incubated for 5 days
and counted for colonies. Mutation frequency is defined as the
number of acrylate tolerant colony forming units, divided by the
total number of colony forming units.

RNA-sequencing and analysis
Cultures of PCC 7002 were grown in 5 mM acrylate or
unmodified medium A + in quadruplet to an OD 730 of 0.5-0.6.
Duplicate cultures from each condition were harvested for RNA
sequencing. RNA was isolated from PCC 7002 using the Trizol
95 method and a RNeasy kit (Qiagen) [ 23]. RNA purity was
verified using an Agilent RNA 600 Nano Kit and Agilent 2100
Bioanalyzer. Ribosomal RNA was removed using the Epicentre
rRNA removal kit for Gram negative bacteria (RZNB1056).
RNA was sequenced by the University of Wisconsin Gene
Expression Center using an Illumina HiSeq 2000. The resulting
RNA sequencing reads were aligned to the PCC 7002 genome
(Genbank ID CP000951.1-CP000957.1) and analyzed using
CLC Genomics Workbench software. Reads per kilobase per
million total reads (RPKM) was used to quantify expression
values [ 24]. Genes identified as being differentially regulated
were defined as having greater than 2 fold changes in RPKM
and a P-value less than 0.05. Single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) were identified using the CLC Genomics Workbench
software. Genes of interest were identified as having SNPs in
acrylate cultures but not control cultures. These data have
been deposited in NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (REF)
and are accessible through the GEO Series accession number
GSE48981 (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?
acc=GSE48981).
Mutant construction
All plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 2. A PCC
7002 ΔacsA mutant (BPSyn_006) was constructed by double
homologous recombination as previously described [ 25].
Briefly, a linear DNA fragment was constructed containing a
streptomycin resistance marker derived from pSRA81 ( aadA)
flanked by approximately 600 bp regions that are homologous
to regions directly 5’ and 3’ of the acsA (SYNPCC7002_A1838)
gene. The acsA upstream and acsA downstream pieces were
individually amplified using the primers in Table 3, digested,
and then ligated together with the digestion fragment of
pSRA81. The resulting fragment was PCR amplified and
transformed into wild type PCC 7002. A similar protocol was
used to replace acsA with a 40 bp barcode sequence, resulting
in strain BPSyn_014. A linear fragment was created with 600
bp homologous regions and a 40 bp barcode sequence in
between. This fragment was transformed into PCC 7002 and
mutants were selected on plates containing 50 µM acrylate.
Positive clones were streaked out on plates containing 10 mM
acrylate to achieve complete chromosomal segregation. The
resulting mutant had a deletion of acsA without a residual
antibiotic resistance cassette. Complementation of acsA was
performed through the introduction of acsA under the native
acsA promoter into glpK (SYNPCC7002_A2842). Due to a
frameshift mutation, glpK is a pseudogene in PCC 7002. For
this reason, glpK was chosen as a neutral insertion site.
Plasmids pGLPK_acsA_SpR and pGLPK_acsAW49L_SpR were
constructed with homologous flanking regions to replace glpK
with either (1) a wild type copy of acsA or (2) acsAW49L under
the native acsA promoter along with a streptomycin resistance
marker, using the in vitro recombination method using primers
in Table 3 [26]. Plasmids pACSA_pcpcB_YFP and
pGLPK_pcpcB_YFP were constructed in a similar manner
using the cpcB promoter from PCC 6803 and yellow florescent
protein (YFP) gene from plasmid pAQ1_Exp_YFP built by Xu
et al. [ 27]. All cyanobacterial strains were screened by colony
PCR for proper integration and full segregation of all
chromosomes.
AcsA activity assay
Wildtype acsA and the acsAW49L mutant were cloned into
the pET-28a plasmid (Novagen) with an N-terminal His-tag.

Strains of E. coli DH10B harboring these plasmids were grown
in 50 mL LB at 37 °C to an OD 600 of 0.6-0.8 and induced with 1
mM IPTG. Induced cultures were incubated at 37 °C for 3 h.
The cultures were centrifuged at 3,000 x g for 15 min and the
resulting cell pellets were frozen at -20 °C. BugBuster reagent
(Novagen) was used to lyse cells and collect the soluble
protein fraction. AcsA protein was purified from the soluble
fraction using Ni-NTA His-tag affinity chromatography.
Reactions containing 500 nM enzyme and 2 mM organic acid
were performed at 37 °C for 6 min. Specific activity was
determined by measuring the loss of free Coenzyme A over
time using Ellman’s reagent. Specific activity is defined as µmol
free CoA min -1 µmol-1 AcsA. 3-hydroxypropionate is
abbreviated to 3-HP.
Counter selection
PCC 7002 was transformed by adding 3 µg of linearized
plasmid to 2 mL of culture at OD 730 1-1.5. The cultures were
incubated without agitation overnight under the previously
mentioned light and temperature conditions. Transformants
were selected by plating both 100 µL and the remaining 1.9 mL
transformation suspension, concentrated, on solid media
supplemented with 50 μM acrylate. Plates were incubated in
the light for 2-3 days at 35 °C. A successful transformation
usually had significantly more colonies than the no-DNA,
negative control. Single colonies were patched onto solid
media supplemented with 50 μM acrylate. This intermediate
step was used to avoid colony PCR contamination by excess
DNA used in the transformation. After 1 day of growth at
standard conditions, the presence of the insertion was
confirmed by colony PCR. Single colonies of positive
transformants were isolated on solid media containing 10 mM
acrylate. Incubation for 3-5 days allowed for complete
segregation of the transformants. Segregation was confirmed

unmodified medium.
Florescence Detection
Cultures of PCC 7002 containing YFP were grown in
triplicate to an OD 730 0.5-1. Cultures were normalized to 4
OD730 * mL and centrifuged at 5,000 x g for 10 min. The
resulting pellets were aspirated, resuspended in 300 µL
BugBuster Protein Extraction Reagent (Novagen), rocked at
room temperature for 30 min, and centrifuged at 16,000 x g for
25 min at 4 °C. The florescence of the resulting supernatant
was measured (excitation 514 nm, emission 527 nm) using a
Tecan M1000 plate reader.
Quantification of acetate
After 75 h of growth, 1 mL samples taken from triplicate
cultures were centrifuged at 16,000 x g for 10 min. Each
supernatant was passed through a 0.22 µm filter prior to
analysis via gas chromatography and flame ionization detection
using a Shimadzu GC-2010 oven with a Restek Stabilwax-DA
fused silica column (11052) and AOC-20i auto-injector. The
limit of detection for acetate was 10 µM.
Results and Discussion
Cyanobacteria are sensitive to several organic acids
Two components are necessary for a successful counter
selection method. First, a compound must be identified that is
inhibitory at low concentrations. Second, this inhibition must be
removed by the loss of a genetic element. Here, the toxicity, as
judged by MIC, of organic acids towards PCC 7002 PCC 6803,
and PCC 7942 was assessed by exposing each strain to
increasing concentrations of organic acids in buffered media.
The organic acids acrylate, 3-hydroxypropionate, and
propionate were each inhibitory to all three cyanobacteria at
relatively low concentrations (Table 4). Acrylate generated the
lowest MIC for each strain (<50 µM) followed by propionate
(0.25-4 mM) and 3-hydroxypropionate (2-70 mM).
Mutations increase organic acid tolerance
Wild type PCC 7002 was inoculated into medium containing
5 mM acrylate, a concentration several orders of magnitude
above the MIC. The OD 730 was observed relative to control
cultures for a period of 200 h. For the first 50 h of incubation,
no increase in OD 730 was observed in acrylate containing
cultures. After this long lag the OD 730 increased at rate similar
to the control culture (Figure 1A). Sub-culturing of the acrylate
exposed cultures into fresh medium containing 5 mM acrylate
resulted in no growth inhibition (Figure 1B). Additionally,
acrylate exposed cultures that were serially sub-cultured in
medium without acrylate for four iterations maintained the
ability to grow in an acrylate concentration above the wild type
MIC. These data suggested that a mutation arose within the
population that resulted in increased tolerance to acrylate.
When wild type PCC 7002 was plated onto solid media

containing 5 mM acrylate, mutant colonies were observed at a
frequency of around 10 -6. Mutants were observed on plates
containing 500 µM and 50 µM acrylate at 5 and 10 times the
frequency of 5 mM, respectively. No mutants were observed on
plates containing 50 mM acrylate. This rate of mutation
frequency was suggestive of a loss of function mutation [ 28].
Additionally, the correlation between mutation frequency and
concentration of acrylate suggested that gene dosage or the
presence of partial loss of function mutations existed.
Interestingly, mutants obtained on acrylate containing medium
were also more tolerant of 3-hydroxpropionate and propionate.
RNA-Sequencing was used to identify mutations
RNA was harvested from the cultures described in Figure
1A. Samples were processed and sequenced to identify

changes in gene expression caused by exposure of wild type
PCC 7002 to acrylate above the MIC. The transcriptome of
cultures grown with acrylate had significantly reduced transcript
levels for genes associated with oxidative stress (Table 5 )
compared to cells grown in unsupplemented media. In
particular, isiA and sufA were down-regulated >10- and >2-fold,
respectively. This was not surprising, as acrylate was shown to
act as an antioxidant in eukaryotic algae [ 29]. Due to the
starting OD730 (0.03) and the OD 730 at which the cultures were
harvested (0.5), it was assumed that the majority of each
population carried a mutation for acrylate tolerance. An
analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) relative to
the published genome sequence (GenBank CP000951.1) was
performed (Table 6). Four genes were identified with SNPs in
all acrylate samples but not present in any of the control
samples. The gene acsA (GenBank NC_010475.1) was of
interest because some acetyl-CoA ligases have been shown to
have activity towards acrylate [ 30]. In acrylate exposed
samples, the reads spanning bp 152 of acsA, 60% (32/53) had
a point mutation of a G to a T. The point mutation results in an
amino acid change of Trp49 to Leu. This amino acid is part of a
conserved region in the acsA of PCC 7002, PCC 6803
(GenBank AP012278.1) and Escherichia coli  K12 (GenBank
NP_418493.1), suggesting it is integral to a functional protein.
These results led to the hypothesis that loss of function of acsA
would result in the observed increase in organic acid tolerance.
AcsA has activity towards acrylate and other organic
acids
To examine the function of AcsA, His-tagged versions of the
wild type gene and an acsAW49L mutant were heterologously
expressed in E. coli. The wild type AcsA protein was found in
the soluble protein fraction and was purified using Ni-NTA His-
tag affinity chromatography. Expression of the acsAW49L
mutant gene generated an insoluble protein. Attempts to purify
the AcsAW49L protein from the soluble fraction with Ni-NTA
affinity chromatography failed. The activity of purified AcsA
protein towards various organic acids was assessed in vitro .
CoA ligase activity was observed for acetate, acrylate, 3-

hydroxypropionate, and propionate (Figure 2). No activity was
observed for succinate under these assay conditions (data not
shown). The activity of AcsA towards these organic acids
supports the results that a single mutation increases tolerance
to all three compounds. While the presence of acyl-CoA
thioesters may be toxic, we hypothesize that the observed
toxicity of acrylate and other organic acids was caused
because the CoA thioesters were metabolic dead-ends and the
continuous activity of AcsA depleted the free CoA pool. This
hypothesis is supported by prior work in which a species of
Synechococcus grown in the presence of propionate was no
longer able to import acetate and was observed to have
decreased levels of free CoA [19].
Loss of function of acsA increases organic acid
tolerance
A PCC 7002 acsA deletion mutant, BPSyn_006, was
constructed by double homologous recombination to replace
acsA with the streptomycin resistance marker aadA.
BPSyn_006 had dramatically higher MIC values for acrylate, 3-
hydroxypropionate, and propionate (Table 4). Specifically, this
mutant had 2,800-fold, 26-fold, and >100 fold increase in MIC
to acrylate, 3-hydroxypropioante, and propionate, respectively.
A similar observation was made in PCC 6803 by replacing

Acrylate Counter Selection in Cyanobacteria
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 7 October 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 10 | e76594
acsA (sll0542) with a kanamycin resistance cassette, resulting
in strain BP6803_002. BP6803_002 has a 3,500-fold increased
tolerance to acrylate, but no increased tolerance to 3-
hydroxypropionate. This suggests that the mechanism of
toxicity of 3-hydroxypropionate is different in PCC 7002 and
PCC 6803. This difference between species and the order or
magnitude increase in acrylate tolerance for both species
makes acrylate a more attractive compound for a universal
counter selection.
The organic acid tolerance phenotype was
complemented in PCC 7002
Attempts to complement the PCC 7002 acsA deletion strain
(BPSyn_006) by introducing and expressing acsA on the native
plasmid pAQ1 or in a chromosomal loci with a kanamycin
resistance cassette resulted in heterogeneous strains that
could not be made homozygous, and thus could not be used in
MIC determination experiments. In order to reuse the aadA
cassette, a markerless deletion of the native acsA locus via
counter selection and then reinsert acsA and the aadA
resistance marker into a newly validated neutral insertion site.
The acsA markerless deletion strain (BPSyn_014) was created
by transforming wild type PCC 7002 with a linear DNA
fragment to replace acsA with a 40 bp barcode (Figure 3A ).
Transformants were selected on solid medium containing 50
µM acrylate, a low concentration that allows for the growth of
heterozygous transformants. Mutants positive for the barcode
insertion were streaked onto medium containing 10 mM
acrylate. The increase in acrylate concentrations allowed for
selection of homozygous clones. Single colonies were
demonstrated to be homozygous via colony PCR (Figure 3B ).
This strain, BPSyn_014, had MIC values identical to
BPSyn_006. When compared to wild type PCC 7002, strain
BPSyn_014 did not have a significant defect in growth up to 75
h (Figure 4A), but was observed to secrete acetate (370 ± 20
µM for BPSyn_014 vs. none detected for wild type). The
markerless deletion allowed for the reuse of the aadA selection
marker to introduce acsA into another locus on the
chromosome.
The locus glpK was chosen as a neutral insertion site for
introduction of genes for complementation of the increased
organic acid phenotype. In PCC 7002, glpK has a frameshift
mutation and is thus considered a pseudogene. Since glpK
cannot produce a functional protein, it was hypothesized that
replacement of glpK would not affect physiology. Strain
BPSyn_014 was complemented by introducing either (1) a wild
type copy of acsA or (2) a W49L acsA mutant under the native
acsA promoter along with the aadA selection cassette, into the
glpK locus of the chromosome, resulting in strains BPSyn_022
and BPSyn_026, respectively. The MIC for acrylate and 3-
hydroxypropionate for BPSyn_022 were 10µM and 15mM,
respectively, similar to wild type PCC 7002 (Table 4). The MIC
for acrylate for BPSyn_026 is 7mM, which suggests that the
W49L mutant results in only a partial loss of function (Table 4 ).
Additionally, the frequency of acrylate tolerance mutations of
BYSyn_022 and BPSyn_026 observed on 50 µM acrylate
plates were the same as wildtype PCC 7002.
Acrylate counter selection can be used for
heterologous gene expression
To optimize the counter selection method, the 40 bp barcode
sequence used to create strain BPSyn_014 and a linearized
plasmid containing His-tagged yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)
under the high expression cpcB constitutive promoter (pACS_
pcpcB_YFP) were transformed into wild type PCC 7002 and
selected for on 50, 100, and 500 µM acrylate. After 3 days,
colonies containing integrations were only observed on plates
containing 50 µM acrylate. The percentage of colonies that
were positive for integrations was 49% (n = 42) for the barcode
and 30% for YFP (n = 39). A t-test of these data shows no

significant difference in integration frequency (p = 0.11)
indicating that insertion size had little impact on integration
efficiency. Colonies not containing integrations were assumed
to be spontaneous mutants of acsA. The number of
background colonies is consistent with the loss of function
mutation frequency previously observed. A homozygous strain
for the integration of YFP (BPSyn_015) was obtained by
streaking onto plates containing 10 mM acrylate and confirmed
by colony PCR (Figure 3B). As expected, strain BPSyn_015
was highly fluorescent (Figure 4B). YFP was successfully
purified from BPSyn_015 using Ni-NTA affinity chromatography
and visualized with PAGE.
Next, the acrylate counter selection method was used to
introduce heterologous genes into other loci. Strain

BPSyn_022 (acsA::BC glpK::acsA aadA) was transformed with
the linearized plasmid pGLPK_ pcpcB_YFP to replace acsA
and aadA with YFP under the expression of the cpcB promoter
in the glpK locus (Figure 3C). 29% (n=14) of colonies were
identified as positive transformants via colony PCR, which is
similar to transformations into the acsA locus. Positive
transformants (BPSyn_027) were verified as homozygous

acsA locus (Figure 3D). As expected, YFP was successfully
purified from BPSyn_027 and visualized using Ni-NTA affinity
chromatography and PAGE. When compared to BPSyn_015,
no significant difference was observed in the level of YFP
fluorescence (Figure 4B). These results demonstrate that
acrylate counter selection can be used to make modifications
beyond the native acsA locus and that the glpK locus has utility
as a neutral insertion site. The counter selection methodology
is summarized in Figure 5.
Conclusion
Counter selection is an important tool for genetic
manipulation of microorganisms. Counter selection is of
particular importance in cyanobacterial systems due to the
presence of multiple copies of the chromosome and the
difficultly of achieving homozygous strains using antibiotic
resistance genes. The results presented in this work describe
the basis and methodology for using organic acid sensitivity for
counter selection in the cyanobacterium PCC 7002. It was
shown that the organic acids acrylate, 3-hydroxypropionate,
and propionate cause growth inhibition and that this inhibition
can be overcome by loss of the gene acsA. Acrylate was
further pursued for use in counter selection because of the low

acrylate sensitivity.

concentration required for sensitivity, the dramatic increase in
tolerance due to loss of acsA, and the potential to be used in
other cyanobacteria (e.g. PCC 6803). A method was optimized
for introducing genes of interest directly into the acsA locus.
Loss of acsA did not result in a growth defect under the
conditions used in this experiment, but did result in an increase
in the secretion of acetate by PCC 7002. A neutral site, glpK,
was identified as a chromosomal locus that is amenable to
acrylate counter selection and can be used for expression of
heterologous genes. These results suggest that acrylate
counter selection could also be used to make markerless
deletions or insertions elsewhere on the chromosome.
Additionally, a loss of function of acsA in PCC 6803 was shown
to dramatically increase the tolerance to acrylate, suggesting
that this method has utility in multiple species. Application of
the method presented in this work will be used in future
physiology studies and metabolic engineering efforts.
