It is unclear how CRISPR editing outcomes vary across the genome and whether undesirable events such as struc-
tural variants (SVs) are predictable or preventable. To define a genome-  wide map of editability, we performed 
whole- genome sequencing on 1875 budding yeast clones edited across 16 chromosomes by CRISPR-  Cas9 and 
donor- templated repair. We found that unintended edits, including short indels and SVs, were enriched in specific 
genomic and sequence contexts. We developed a predictive model, SCORE (System for CRISPR Outcome and Risk 
Evaluation), which revealed 4.8% of the genome as SV prone, consisting of 562 SV hotspots. Donor repair- 
enhancing strategies suppressed SV formation in regions with moderate, but not high, predicted risk. Applying 
SCORE to the Sc2.0 synthetic yeast genome revealed a markedly altered SV landscape due to the removal of en-
dogenous repetitive elements and the insertion of loxP sites. Our study provides the genome- scale map of SV 
hotspots after CRISPR editing and predictive and experimental tools to mitigate their formation.
INTRODUCTION
CRISPR RNA- guided programmable nucleases have revolutionized 
research, medicine, and biotechnology by enabling precise and effi-
cient editing of the genome. However, the potential for unintended 
mutations at on-  and off- target sites continues to raise concerns for 
basic research ( 1), therapeutic (2 ), and industrial applications (3 ). 
CRISPR editing systems trigger genome editing by inducing either 
single- strand breaks (SSBs) or double- strand breaks (DSBs). DSBs 
can lead to disruption of target genes through small insertions or de-
letions via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or microhomology- 
mediated end joining (MMEJ) (4). DSBs can also be harnessed for 
incorporation of designed sequence changes by homology- directed 
repair (HDR) with an exogenous template. However, in some in-
stances, CRISPR- induced DSBs can lead to unintended structur -
al variants (SVs), including large deletions, translocations, loss of 
chromosome arms, and partial aneuploidies (5 , 6). These SVs can 
have serious adverse effects as they can lead to gene loss, silencing, 
or altering of gene function, and can precipitate chromosomal insta-
bility and chromothripsis (7). Even nickase- based systems, including 
base and prime editors, induce transient DSB formation at nicked 
sites that can yield SVs at both on- target and off- target sites (8–11). 
Understanding why SVs occur and predicting regions at risk for SV 
formation is thus relevant for all genome editing approaches. While 
existing tools have enabled predictions of certain editing outcomes, 
such as editing efficiency (12,  13) and the spectrum of small indels 
resulting from NHEJ (14) and MMEJ (15), no tool is presently ca-
pable of predicting large- scale chromosomal rearrangements or 
large deletions.
Although there are isolated reports of SVs occurring with a variety 
of CRISPR systems, comprehensive, genome- wide surveys character-
izing their frequency and genomic distribution are currently missing. 
This gap largely stems from the inherent limitations of conventional 
genotyping methods [e.g., polymerase chain reaction (PCR)–based 
target sequencing] in detecting SVs and a lack of approaches capable 
of characterizing unexpected editing outcomes such as SVs across the 
genome in an unbiased fashion. Consequently, it is unclear how fre-
quently SVs arise across any genome in response to CRISPR editing, 
whether certain regions are at a particularly high risk, and if such loci 
can be predicted based on sequence and chromosomal context. In 
this study, we tackle this question using the budding yeast model sys-
tem, as its relatively modest genome size allows for comprehensive 
whole- genome sequence (WGS) assessment across many genomic 
sites. We analyzed WGS outcomes for thousands of edits spanning all 
16 nuclear chromosomes and found that most sites are edited cor -
rectly and that off- target indels by Cas9 are virtually nonexistent. Un-
expectedly, however, we find that a subset of target sites is highly 
prone to forming SVs. We show that these SVs arise from competing 
local and/or distal sequence repetitiveness and built a machine learn-
ing model termed SCORE (System for CRISPR Outcome and Risk 
Evaluation) to map the locations of all SV hotspots in the genome as 
well as to assess the likelihood for correct editing at all SpCas9 tar -
get sites.
RESUL TS
Mapping intended and unintended CRISPR- Cas9 editing 
outcomes genome- wide
To explore the spectrum of CRISPR- Cas9 editing outcomes genome- 
wide, we used a multiplexed HDR template–based CRISPR editing 
approach we previously developed termed MAGESTIC (16) to edit 
a laboratory strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae at sites spread across 
the genome (Fig. 1A). To target the entire genome in an unbiased 
fashion, we designed a library of thousands of single- nucleotide and 
multinucleotide variants (SNVs/MNVs) and short indels naturally 
present in the species and which are spread throughout all 16 chro-
mosomes. First, we constructed a pool of paired guide RNA (gRNA)

and donor DNA (guide- donor) plasmids tagged with short, random 
DNA barcodes (Fig. 1A). The barcodes serve as unique edit identi-
fiers and are integrated at a dedicated locus in the genome after edit-
ing. We used robotic colony picking and recombinase- directed 
indexing (REDI) (17) to pick 2260 haploid clones with barcodes 
corresponding to verified guide- donor sequences for whole- genome 
sequencing (WGS). The picked clones encompassed three succes-
sive versions of the MAGESTIC system (v1.1, v1.2, and v1.3), each 
incorporating iterative improvements in editing efficiency (Materi-
als and Methods). Next, we prepared WGS libraries with a low- cost 
and efficient method we previously developed that bypasses the 
need for genomic DNA extraction (18). We sequenced each genome 
at 5× coverage and mapped the intended and unintended mutations 
in each individual genome with a computational pipeline geared to-
ward assessing intended edits, short indels, and various types of SVs 
(fig. S1A and Materials and Methods).
A total of 1875 clones harbored sufficient coverage at the target 
regions for calling editing outcomes (Fig. 1B and table S1). A total of 
1414 clones exhibited HDR template–encoded variants consistent 
with the intended edits predicted by the genome- integrated barcodes. 
Of 346 MNV- intended edits, 57 (16.5%) did not incorporate all the 
SNVs present in the donor (fig. S1B), with variant incorporation rate 
dropping with distance from the “NGG” protospacer adjacent motif 
(PAM) (fig. S2A). We also noticed a subset of clones (139 of 1414) 
that harbored not only the designed edit but also distal SNVs. These 
variants were present in the cloning stage of the guide- donor plasmid 
library and likely arose during oligonucleotide synthesis (fig. S2B and 
Supplementary Text). The likelihood of incorporation of a PAM-  
distal variant or synthesis error decreased as a function of distance 
from adjacent variants, reaching 50% incorporation rate at around 
10 bp distance and falling below 10% after 20 bp (fig. S2C).
Overall, 358 of 1875 clones carried the wild- type sequence at 
their target sites. Notably, these unedited clones were overrepresent-
ed in earlier versions of the MAGESTIC system (fig. S3), with the 
most recent version (MAGESTIC v1.3) exhibiting an 82.7% correct 
edit rate (1094 of 1323 sites). NHEJ indels were present at low levels 
across all systems (11 of 1875 clones, or 0.59%), consistent with the 
NHEJ pathway being less error prone in S. cerevisiae relative to other 
organisms (19) and with few clones surviving via NHEJ indel forma-
tion (20). We observed no evidence of gRNA- dependent off- target 
indels or point mutations (fig.  S4). gRNA- independent sequence 
changes were present at a level consistent with the expected back-
ground rate of mutations arising from propagation in cell culture 
(21) (fig. S4). Collectively, our results demonstrate that unintended 
off- target indels and SNVs after CRISPR nuclease- based genome ed-
iting are exceedingly rare in S. cerevisiae and that editing is highly 
efficient and precise across the majority of sites.
SVs are induced at target sites
In addition to the wild- type sequence and HDR-  and NHEJ- mediated 
edits, numerous clones exhibited substantial loss of sequencing cover-
age at the target sites relative to the rest of the genome (figs. S1A and 
S5A). The specific depletion of mapped reads at target sites was sugges-
tive of large- scale genomic changes such as SVs. To better understand 
the occurrence of these events, we developed a pipeline to systemati-
cally detect SVs across 2260 targeted regions and 654 computationally 
predicted off- target regions (with 1, 2, or 3 mismatches to the corre-
sponding gRNA) (Materials and Methods). Our analysis identified a 
total of 92 target sites with SVs (Fig. 1B), comprising 44 large deletions 
(DELs), 43 nonreciprocal translocations (TRAs), and 5 unclassified 
SVs. TRAs could be further subdivided on the basis of whether re-
placement of the target sequence reached the telomere (Fig.  1C and 
fig.  S5A). Complete chromosomal arm replacement events were de-
tected exclusively in (sub)telomeric regions, whereas incomplete re-
placements were found throughout chromosomes (fig.  S6A). Both 
events led to loss of sequence at the targeted site and duplication of se-
quence from another chromosomal location (fig. S6B and table S2). As 
SV detection is influenced by sequencing depth, samples with lower 
coverage (<5×) likely underestimated SV fractions. The true SV rate in 
the editing pool is therefore expected to be slightly higher than the 
4.9% (92 of 1875) estimated from all strains, approaching 7% in sam-
ples with >10× coverage (24 of 345) (fig. S7). In addition to these 92 
clones, we observed 8 clones with SVs at predicted off- target sites with 
one or two mismatches to the gRNA, yielding a total of 100 SVs across 
the entire dataset (Fig. 1D and table S3). Notably, six of eight off- target 
SVs occurred in regions with a single mismatch to the gRNA, two of 
eight with two mismatches, and none with three mismatches, under-
lining the risk of off- target cleavage at sites with high sequence similar-
ity to the target.
More than half of the DEL and TRA breakpoints, defined by the 
mismatched base at the end of the modified sequence within the target 
region (fig. S5B), are flanked by ≥20 bp of perfect homology between 
the target and a distal genomic region (Fig. 1E). This suggests that SV 
formation is not a pervasive outcome of DNA repair but rather is en-
riched in genomic regions where endogenous homologous sequences 
compete with the exogenous donor HDR template. Further inspection 
of the target loci yielding SVs revealed local repetitive sequences pres-
ent as tandem repeats in the case of deletions and distal repetitive se-
quences in the case of nonreciprocal translocations. As confirmed by 
recloning, editing, and sequencing of four target sites yielding SV clones 
(Supplementary Text and fig. S6C), the SV rate of a single guide- donor 
pair ranged from 71.1 to 97.6% (Fig. 1F and table S4), substantially ex-
ceeding the genome- wide rate of 4.9% (92 of 1875 clones). Further-
more, sites with SVs exhibited slightly greater chromatin accessibility 
(versus unedited sites, Wilcoxon’s rank sum test’s P = 0.029, N = 178) 
(fig. S6D) and higher H2A S129 phosphorylation (H2AS129ph) level 
(versus unedited sites, Wilcoxon’s rank sum test’s P   =  2.7  ×  10−5, 
N  =  178) (fig.  S8). H2AS129ph (functionally equivalent to human 
H2AS139ph, also known as γH2AX) is transiently induced after DNA 
damage (22) and found at higher levels in the S- G2 phases specifically in 
regions prone to DNA replication stress such as the subtelomeric re-
gions (23). We reasoned that the correlation of SV incidence with 
H2AS129ph is likely a consequence of the sequence repetitiveness in 
these regions, which leads to a high recombination rate and genetic in-
stability (24). Together, these findings indicate that Cas9- induced SVs 
are context dependent and driven primarily by HDR in the yeast sys-
tem. Their tendency to arise predominantly in repetitive regions sug-
gests that these occurrences may, in fact, be predictable. This contrasts 
with the limited studies on SV prevalence in mouse and human cells, 
where SV formation shows a predisposition to MMEJ pathways and 
where outcomes are highly heterogenous and do not appear to follow 
any predictable pattern based on the locations or lengths of micro-
homology sequences (25, 26).
Development of a machine learning model for predicting 
Cas9- induced SVs genome- wide
We developed SCORE (https://apps.embl.de/score/) to predict the 
likelihood of an SV or lack of editing for every SpCas9 target site in

the S. cerevisiae genome. SCORE is an ensemble of gradient- boosted 
decision tree (GBDT) models trained on the 1875 characterized 
events in our clones (Fig. 2A). Four classifiers were trained indepen-
dently to distinguish correct edits from unedited sites, DELs, or 
TRAs, incorporating relevant context information encompassing 
target sequence composition, chromatin status and sequence repeti-
tiveness (tables S5 and S6 and Supplementary Text).
Given the observation that endogenous sequence homology ap -
peared to be driving DELs and TRAs (Fig. 1E), we incorporated two 
different metrics into SCORE to distinguish between local and distal 
repetitive sequences (Fig. 2A): the index of local repetitiveness (I LR 
or Ir) (27) and the index of global repetitiveness (I GR), respectively 
(Materials and Methods). As expected, ILR and IGR computed from a 
500- bp window surrounding the target site correlated with SV rates,

with DEL outcomes increasing with ILR and TRA outcomes with IGR 
(Fig. 2B). To account for both short-  and long- range sequence con-
text, we additionally encoded the ILR and IGR using gradients of win-
dow sizes ranging from 50 bp to 10 kb to encompass the SV sizes 
observed in our dataset (up to ~3 kb deletion) (fig. S9).
The model architecture and parameters of SCORE were deter -
mined by benchmarking the model using repeated (n = 5) threefold 
cross- validation over the training data (Materials and Methods). We 
compared four machine learning algorithms (random forest, GBDT, 
and L1-  and L2- regularized logistic regressions) and found GBDT 
to be superior (fig. S10A). To mitigate the class imbalance of SVs 
and unedited clones compared to correctly edited clones, the correct 
edits were downsampled accordingly for the training data (fig. S10, 
B and C). Following model tunings and optimizations, the finalized 
SV predictor achieved an AUROC (Area Under the Receiver Oper-
ating Characteristic Curve) of 0.949 and an AUPRC (Area Under 
the Precision- Recall Curve) of 0.518 (Fig. 2C). All four SCORE sub-
models substantially outperformed random classifiers (Fig.  2C). 
Analysis of feature importance revealed long T homopolymers 
(16, 28) and gRNA sequence composition as the top variables pre-
dicting the absence of editing (fig. S11). The editing system influ-
enced baseline editing efficiency and acted as a confounding factor 
to the SCORE- unedit model (fig. S3A). Local and distal sequence 
repetitiveness were the top variables predicting SVs, with no detect-
able impact from the editing system (fig. S11). This finding aligns 
with the observation that SV rates remained relatively consistent 
across the three editing systems of varying efficiency (fig. S3A), sug-
gesting that SV formation becomes the dominant repair outcome in 
repetitive regions, obfuscating the editing machinery enhancements 
optimized for nonrepetitive regions.
A map of the editable regions in the S. cerevisiae 
reference genome
Using SCORE, we conducted a genome- wide survey of editable re-
gions encompassing all 873,419 NGG motifs with unique spacers on 
16 yeast chromosomes, excluding 66,538 sequences with perfect off- 
target matches (gRNAs that can bind to >1 genomic target without 
mismatches). The predicted scores for the absence of editing were 
scattered along the chromosomal axis, suggesting that local sequence 
context plays a major role over larger regional effects (Fig. 2D). In 
contrast, sites with high SV probabilities were clustered into a hand-
ful of hotspots per chromosome (Fig. 2D).
The genomic distribution of SV scores showed a skewed, right-  
tailed distribution, reflecting the low rate of SV formation for the ma-
jority of the genome, with only a small portion exhibiting elevated 
risks. This hypothesis aligns with the low fraction of SVs observed in 
our pooled editing experiment (3.8 to 7.4%, fig. S3A) but high SV rate 
at individual target sites (Fig. 1E). On the basis of the empirical distri-
bution of each predictive score, we established cutoffs to identify out-
liers within the tails of each distribution (fig. S12; SV score  > 0.15; 
DEL score > 0.15; TRA score > 0.15; unedited score > 0.25) and cat-
egorize these sites as difficult- to- edit regions (DTERs). This approach 
identified 4.8% of the genome susceptible to SV formation upon Cas9 
cleavage (1.7% for DEL and 3.1% for TRA) and 11.1% of sites as like-
ly to remain unedited (table S7). By grouping sites in proximity with 
SV scores >0.15, we identified 562 SV hotspots across 16 yeast chro-
mosomes, with an average cluster size of 2 kb and 57.9 PAM sites per 
cluster (table  S8). Of the regions at risk for SVs, 54.2%  overlapped 
with protein- coding genes, indicating a depletion of SV hotspots 
within the 78.9% of the genome that codes for proteins (Fig. 2E). The 
distribution of SV scores in essential genes and stress- responsive 
TATA box–containing genes (29) (Materials and Methods) showed 
no trend of increase or decrease compared to all coding regions 
(fig. S13). It is important to note, however, that SCORE does not con-
sider the phenotypic impact of the editing outcomes, and it is possi-
ble, if not likely, that many of the SVs predicted in essential genes may 
not lead to viable outcomes. As expected, SV- prone loci were more 
prevalent in telomeric and transposable elements, as well as tRNA 
genes due to their repetitive nature (Fig. 2F and fig. S13). The ribo-
somal RNA genes, present as a long array of 100 to 150 tandem re-
peats (30), were absent from our analysis as no gRNA sequences can 
uniquely target a single copy.
We further examined the relationship between our predicted SV 
landscape and naturally occurring SVs that have arisen during the 
evolution of S. cerevisiae genome, as defined by a collection of 142 
telomere- to- telomere assemblies of yeast strains (31). We observed 
not only an overall elevation in prediction scores at natural SV sites 
but also a colocalization between natural SV breakpoints and local 
peaks in the prediction score (fig. S14). Although the SVs identified 
in our study were induced by artificial DNA DSBs (i.e., by the 
CRISPR- Cas9 system), this finding suggests that the underlying 
DNA repair outcome preferences are likely shared with those driv-
ing natural SV formation. Moreover, these repair outcome prefer -
ences, as observed in our laboratory strain, appear to be broadly 
conserved across natural S. cerevisiae populations and may have 
played a role in shaping the distribution of SVs throughout yeast 
genome evolution.
Boosting HDR efficiency reduces SV formation in DTERs
Our results suggest that endogenous homologous sequences compete 
for HDR at the target site with the donor template. Therefore, we sought 
to assess whether these alternative repair outcomes can be reduced or 
prevented through specifically enhancing donor template HDR effi-
ciency. Our dataset used an editing technique (MAGESTIC v1.3) that 
improves HDR efficiency by active recruitment of double- stranded 
DNA (dsDNA) donor templates to DSBs (16). This donor recruitment 
system is based on a fusion protein consisting of the Fkh1 forkhead- 
associated (FHA) domain, which recognizes phosphothreonine resi-
dues accumulating around DSBs (32), and the LexA DNA- binding 
domain (16) of the bacterial transcriptional repressor LexA. In a recent 
improvement to MAGESTIC, we “supercharged” HDR activity through 
combining three HDR enhancing techniques: in vivo single- stranded 
DNA (ssDNA) synthesis with a bacterial retron system (33), recruit-
ment of plasmid dsDNA and retron- generated ssDNA templates to 
DSBs via an MS2 coat protein (MCP)- LexA- FHA fusion protein, and 
in vivo assembly of linearized donor plasmid (34) [Fig. 3A; MAGESTIC 
3.0 (35)]. To assess whether SVs could be minimized through any or a 
combination of these HDR enhancement strategies, we compared SV 
formation at eight target locations across six editing systems (tables S9 
and S10), spanning from a minimal setup using only plasmid donor 
and Cas9 (termed Cas9- only) to the full MAGESTIC 3.0 (retron + 
recruitment + assembly) combination system. We picked target sites 
reflecting a wide range of SV formation likelihoods as predicted by 
SCORE, including 3 DEL and 5 TRA sites. To facilitate evaluation of 
editing outcomes of many clones edited with the same guide- donor, we 
assessed SV formation via bulk WGS of the edited population of cells 
transformed with guide- donor plasmids (or plasmid fragments in the

The Cas9- only system, in the absence of any method to enhance 
HDR, resulted in the highest percentage of SV formation, as evi-
denced by the lowest mapping coverage around the target sites 
(Fig. 3B and fig. S15). In vivo synthesis of ssDNA templates through 
reverse transcription (RT) (33) did not lead to a substantial reduc-
tion in the SV fraction, except when ssDNA was recruited to the 
DSB by the MCP- LexA- FHA protein. This contrasts with previous 
studies where the retron ssDNA donor system substantially im-
proved rate of donor HDR at several non–SV- forming sites (33, 35), 
suggesting that FHA- mediated recruitment is critical for successful 
editing of SV- prone sites. Editing efficiency at most of the tested loci 
was superior in the four systems with FHA- mediated donor recruit-
ment, regardless of template type (Fig.  3, C and D). We observed 
locus- specific differences in the SV fraction for different template 
types, with ssDNA retron donor recruitment being superior to ds-
DNA plasmid donor recruitment at some sites (DEL2, FR2, and 
TR1) but not others (DEL1 and TR2) (Fig. 3D). Overall, the MAGES-
TIC 3.0 system showed the highest fraction of correct donor-  
mediated edits and the greatest reduction in SV formation in six out 
of eight loci (DEL1, DEL3, FR2, FR3, TR1, and TR2). In two of the 
tested loci (DEL1 and TR2), the estimated SV fraction was reduced 
from more than 50% in the Cas9- only setup to nearly zero, with a 
near 100% efficiency for editing of the designed variant (Fig. 3D). In 
addition to preventing large SVs, the MAGESTIC 3.0 combination 
system also provided an advantage in overcoming smaller deletions 
(24 bp) at one locus (Fig. 3D, DEL2).
While HDR enhancement approaches used in the MAGESTIC 
3.0 system generally reduced SV formation, some sites showed only 
a weak or no improvement (e.g., FR1 and DEL3). Sites with different 
degrees of SV reduction could be distinguished by their predicted 
SV scores: three sites with scores between 0.3 and 0.5 were effec-
tively rescued, while four sites with scores above 0.8 were recalci-
trant to HDR enhancement (Fig.  3C). Overall, the SV score was 
correlated with the degree of SV formation suppressible by the 
MAGESTIC3.0 system (Pearson’s r = 0.71, P = 0.051, N = 8). This 
observation suggests that SCORE can be used quantitatively to pre-
dict a continuous variation of editing outcome likelihoods genome- 
wide. In summary, we conclude that amplifying and recruiting 
exogenous donor templates to Cas9 cleavage sites can outcompete 
endogenous homologous sequences as repair templates and prevent 
undesirable repair outcomes at regions with moderate SV risk.
Validation of SCORE across an additional 1122 clones
To test the performance of SCORE across additional genomic re-
gions not seen in the training data, we validated our model on an 
independent panel of edits generated by the MAGESTIC 3.0 system. 
We isolated 1122 clones edited across 220 loci with 883 unique 
gRNA sequences and performed WGS at an average depth of ~20×. 
Of the 1122 clones, 488 were targeted by LbCas12a at sites flanking 
a 5′ TTTV PAM motif (table S11).
Setting a threshold of SV likelihood score greater than 0.15, we 
flagged 186 of the 1122 clones as SV prone, which captured 94.3% 
(83 of 88) of true SVs confirmed by WGS (Fig. 4A). Despite SCORE 
being trained only on data obtained with SpCas9, this threshold de-
tected SVs equally well in both the SpCas9 and LbCas12a libraries 
(SpCas9: 10 of 11; LbCas12a: 73 of 77), suggesting that the SCORE 
predictions for SV formation are generalizable across different nu-
cleases (Fig. 4B and fig. S16).
In addition to the 0.15 threshold, we noticed that an SV likelihood 
cutoff of 0.5 was able to distinguish sites with an intermediate risk for 
SVs from sites with a high risk (Fig. 4, B and C). This was consistent 
with HDR donor recruitment reducing SV incidence at sites with 
moderate SV scores between 0.3 and 0.5, but not at four sites with 
high SV scores >0.5 (Fig. 3C). Similar to SpCas9, LbCas12a targets 
showed an increasing SV rate with higher SV scores, albeit with an 
overall higher SV rate (Fig. 4B).
The ability of SCORE to stratify a CRISPR library based on unin-
tended repair outcome profiles presents an effective strategy for 
producing high- quality variant libraries and reducing false- positive 
hits by prioritizing clonal isolation and validation of edits in SV-  
prone loci (Fig. 4D). For instance, targets with a low SV risk (0 to 
0.15) are safe for pooled experiments as they are expected to yield 
predominantly correct edits. For targets with moderate SV risks 
(0.15 to 0.5), arraying the edited population followed by sequence 
validation enables generation of clonal populations devoid of unde-
sired genotypes. High- risk SV sites (>0.5) are more challenging to 
edit and likely require screening of a high number of clones to ob-
tain a correct edit. These targets should be held out at the design 
stage or flagged during analysis to mitigate false- positive pheno-
typic interpretations.
The editable landscape of the synthetic yeast genome
The Sc2.0 synthetic yeast project involved the de novo design and 
synthesis of the 16 S. cerevisiae chromosomes (36, 37). While based 
on the laboratory strain S288C reference genome, each chromosome 
was redesigned with major sequence changes to maximize genome 
stability and to enable previously unknown genomic functionaliza-
tions. These included the deletion of repetitive elements, introns, and 
tRNA genes, recoding of tandem repeats within and between open 
reading frames (ORFs) by using synonymous changes that minimize 
recombination potential, changing all TAG stop codons to TAA to 
free up the TAG codon for future noncanonical amino acid incorpo-
ration, and the introduction of loxPsym sites for the SCRaMbLE 
system by Cre- lox induction (38).
The Sc2.0 gene content is closely related to the S288C genome 
used in the development and validation of SCORE, which allowed 
us to ask how the SV- risk landscape was altered by the design fea-
tures mentioned above. We hypothesized that the removal of repeti-
tive elements should reduce the fraction of the genome prone to SV 
formation and enable editing at sites previously uneditable in the 
laboratory strain, including subtelomeric regions, loci with repeti-
tive ORFs, and between tandemly repeated domains within ORFs. 
On the other hand, we reasoned that the inclusion of the 34- bp lox-
Psym sites could add potential for recombination, particularly large 
deletions, when situated close together.
We applied SCORE to predict SV subtypes DEL and TRA across 
859,529 NGG sites on the 16 synthetic Sc2.0 chromosomes. As ex-
pected, hotspots with high TRA scores in the native S288C genome 
were largely absent in their Sc2.0 counterparts (fig. S17). Chromo-
some III was the most affected, with five high- risk TRA regions in 
the chromosome body and one in the telomeric region removed in 
Sc2.0 (Fig. 5A). All synthetic chromosomes exhibited a lower frac-
tion of high- risk TRA sites (TRA score > 0.5; fig. S18 and table S12), 
with chromosome I and III showing the most substantial decreases 
by 74.4 and 86.6% relative to the S288C genome (from 1332 to 325 
TRA- risk sites in chromosome I, and from 938 to 114 sites in

chromosome III) (Fig.  5B). While all chromosomes have similar 
lengths for the telomeric and subtelomeric regions, there is substan-
tial variation in the chromosome arm length. Chromosomes I and 
III have the largest subtelomeric- to- arm length ratios in the yeast 
genome, due to their relatively short arms, resulting in the highest 
proportion of TRA- prone sites. On the other hand, the deletion 
likelihood map was markedly altered by the presence of the 34-  bp 
Cre- loxP sites, with a negative correlation observed between ad -
jacent loxP distances and the predicted deletion rate (Pearson’s 
r = −0.54, P < 2.2 × 10−16) (Fig. 5, A and C). It is not just the lox-
Psym sites that are problematic for Cas9 targeting, but the regions in 
between the sites themselves are rendered deletion prone despite 
containing unique target sites. Overall, the fraction of the Sc2.0 ge-
nome with high SCORE- TRA risk was reduced by half from 1.46 to

0.70%. Our analysis identified regions of the Sc2.0 genome that are 
likely to be refractory to downstream modifications by CRISPR 
nuclease- based approaches. This example highlights the value of 
SCORE in advancing future de novo genome sequence designs that 
minimize deletion and translocation risks (Fig. 5C).
DISCUSSION
To improve the accuracy and fidelity of CRISPR editing for applica-
tions ranging from genome- wide screens to therapeutic editing, it is 
critical to characterize the spectrum and frequencies of unintended 
changes to the genome, from small- scale off- target point mutations to 
large- scale chromosome- level changes such as SVs. Furthermore, ed-
iting outcomes need to be assessed in diverse chromosomal contexts, 
as the endogenous DNA repair pathways responsible for generating 
various lesions in response to SSBs and DSBs can be locus- dependent 
(39–41). WGS of edited clones is the gold standard, yet a large- scale 
survey of thousands of sites is currently intractable in organisms with 
large complex genomes such as humans, where >500- fold more reads 
are needed to achieve the same sequencing depth as in yeast. In this

study, we analyzed 1875 edited yeast genomes randomly sampled 
from a genome- wide library of natural variants to explore editing out-
comes in an unbiased fashion. Our analysis revealed that the likeli-
hood of SV formation upon CRISPR is not uniformly distributed 
across the yeast genome, but rather strongly enriched within a limited 
subset, within 4.8% of the genome, which exhibited frequent and re-
current SV formation (Fig. 1F). Notably, the risk of forming SVs per-
sisted even in editing systems optimized for high editing efficiency 
(i.e., MAGESTIC v1.3 with > 80% efficiency, fig.  S3A) and is likely 
independent of the targeting and cleavage machinery, including opti-
mizations to the guide and the Cas nuclease or with different nucle-
ases such as LbCas12a (Fig.  4B). Our attempts to overcome SV 
formation with an improved donor template repair system using re-
cruitment of retron- generated ssDNA donor templates and in  vivo 
plasmid assembly (MAGESTIC 3.0) were successful only at a subset 
of SV- prone loci (Fig.  3), indicating that a fraction of the yeast ge-
nome is potentially off- limits to HDR- based editing approaches.
Our data suggest that SVs in yeast are driven primarily by HDR 
with endogenous homologies that can present themselves at a broad 
range of distances from target sites, from several tens to many thou-
sands of base pairs. This is likely because the resection of broken 
DNA ends at the target site can extend up to thousands of bases, 
generating partial single- stranded DNA that is exposed to the ho-
mology search machinery, thereby enabling recombination to initi-
ate far from the DSB (42). Consequently, regions affected by SVs can 
lie at considerable distances from repetitive elements yet still harbor 
large stretches of uniquely targeting gRNA sequences without any 
apparent off- target potential (fig. S19). This makes manual assess-
ments of SV likelihoods based on the local sequence context intrac-
table. To improve CRISPR editing outcomes, it is essential to 
consider multiple layers of genomic context and identify the optimal 
combination that maximizes editing efficiency while minimizing 
undesired outcomes. Achieving this requires not only modeling the 
relationship between individual genomic features and editing out-
comes, but also the capacity to compare diverse feature combina-
tions and determine the most favorable design and editing strategy. 
In this regard, our machine learning model SCORE provides quan-
titative measures to meet these challenges. SCORE- unedit enables 
the selection of high- efficiency guides by avoiding certain gRNA 
sequence compositions (e.g., long T stretches) and regions with 
low chromatin accessibility. Complementarily, SCORE- SV evalu-
ates local and distal repetitive sequences at different context lengths 
to identify and avoid regions at high risk for SV formation. The 
genome- wide set of SCORE predictions is available in an interactive 
genome browser (https://apps.embl.de/score/) for the community 
to use for applications ranging from CRISPR editing of individual 
loci to genome- wide variant screens. Users can prioritize gRNAs 
with high predicted efficacy and low predicted SV likelihoods and 
implement additional steps to isolate correct edits in SV hotspots by 
using MAGESTIC 3.0 to boost template repair and by screening 
many clones (Fig. 4D). SCORE can also be used to improve variant 
screens by prioritizing SV- prone loci for additional validation steps.
The propensity for DSBs to induce chromosomal rearrange-
ments and gene conversions close to the telomeric ends has previ-
ously been reported in budding yeast (43), mouse embryonic stem 
cells (44), and human cancer cells (45). Subtelomeric regions in eu-
karyotic chromosomes exhibit high sequence repetitiveness both 
within and between each other, a trait that may represent evolution-
ary adaptation to replication stress in these regions (46). The 
tendency toward nonreciprocal translocations in these regions in 
haploid yeast is consistent with the enrichment of loss of heterozy-
gosity toward telomeric arms observed in diploid wild isolates 
across the yeast species (47), where it has been proposed to aid in 
the expression of recessive phenotypes and to increase allelic diver-
sification (47). Cells may have evolved higher rates of HDR in sub-
telomeric regions via break- induced replication (BIR) in response to 
the greater prevalence of replication stress- induced DSB in these 
regions (46). Another factor contributing to the higher tendency for 
subtelomeric translocations over exogenous donor HDR in our as-
say may be due to subtelomeric regions exhibiting elevated levels of 
SSBs (48), which have been shown to improve HDR efficiency when 
occurring on endogenous chromosomal donors (49). Supporting 
this hypothesis, a study in S. cerevisiae reported higher survival rates 
of strains with DSBs near (sub)telomeric regions compared to inter-
mediate chromosomal regions (43). Similarly, a study using a donor- 
free CRISPR system in Yarrowia lipolytica observed higher fitness of 
cells with gRNAs targeting subtelomeres (50), from which they con-
cluded a lack of cutting activity at these sites. However, our and oth-
ers’ investigations of repair outcomes (43) suggest that CRISPR 
nucleases cut efficiently near chromosome ends, but that DSBs in 
(sub)telomeric regions are readily resolved by repair with endoge-
nous chromosomal donors, leading to SV formation and cell sur -
vival. Overall, understanding the genome- wide distribution of 
repair outcomes, informed by genomic contexts, would enable edit-
ing strategies to overcome or at least manage the risk of erroneous 
outcomes. Efforts to modulate these pathways toward preferred out-
comes have included chromatin remodeling (51), mismatch repair 
manipulation ( 52), or enhanced donor HDR [e.g., MAGESTIC 
3.0 (35)].
The consideration of long- range genomic context is a major dif-
ference between SCORE- SV and previous computational models, 
which so far have been limited to associating local sequence con-
texts with editing efficiency [e.g., for Cas9 nuclease (12), base editors 
(53), and prime editors (54)] and for predicting smaller- scale unin-
tended on- target outcomes, such as NHEJ indels (14, 55), bystander 
edits (53), and pegRNA scaffold insertions. While it is well- 
established that nuclease efficiency and NHEJ- induced indels are 
influenced by the local sequence context (12, 14), our findings high-
light the importance of long- range sequence features, chromatin 
state, and chromosomal context (e.g., proximity to telomeres). Mod-
els trained on editing outcomes from reporters outside of the en-
dogenous genomic context (e.g., those based on editing artificial 
constructs or endogenous target sites removed from their native lo-
cus) are likely to fall short in predicting large- scale events, which 
may occur only in specific chromosomal regions. Therefore, it is 
crucial to have methods capable of capturing both small- scale and 
large- scale changes. Various non- WGS methods have been devel-
oped to characterize particular classes of SVs at target sites in hu-
man cells, including anchor- based Tn5 approaches to capture 
translocations that preserve one side of the target site (e.g., PEM- 
seq) (56), Southern blotting or use of panels of primers flanking the 
target site combined with long- read sequencing to capture mid- size 
(hundreds of base pairs to several kilobases) deletions (9) or unan-
ticipated insertions (57), and single- cell RNA sequencing to infer 
large deletions or chromosomal arm loss (6). Each of these methods, 
however, has limitations and may fail to detect certain types of SVs 
at target sites. Complementary to these approaches are copy number 
analysis by droplet digital PCR (58) and loss of fluorescence from

single- copy insertions of GFP reporters at or near target sites to in-
fer target site disruption (26). While these assays provide valuable 
insights, they are difficult to scale across multiple genomic sites 
and offer only limited information about the sequence at the SV 
breakpoints, which is important for developing predictive models 
for SV formation.
One limitation of the current study is that the SV landscape was 
characterized in a single laboratory strain background of S. cerevisiae 
using a single CRISPR- Cas9–based editing system (MAGESTIC). 
Because our predictive model, SCORE, was trained on this dataset, 
it may be biased toward the DNA repair preferences of this strain 
under these specific conditions (i.e., donor recruitment). However, 
it is likely that the model can be generalized to other systems with 
similar DNA repair profiles, specifically those with high proficiency 
in HDR over error- prone pathways such as MMEJ. Supporting this, 
we observed that SV breakpoints in 142 natural yeast isolates (31) 
frequently overlapped with SV- prone sites identified in our labora-
tory strain (fig. S14), suggesting that these strain backgrounds may 
share similar vulnerabilities to SV formation upon natural or arti-
ficially introduced DSBs (i.e., by the CRISPR- Cas system). For or -
ganisms more distantly related to S. cerevisiae (e.g., human), we 
anticipate that a similar set of genomic features used in SCORE (i.e., 
local and global sequences and chromatin context) could be applied 
to predict SV likelihoods, at least those driven by HDR- mediated 
processes. However, the model would need to be retrained to cap-
ture the species- specific DNA repair preferences. The observation 
that a larger variety of SV types can arise in human cells (e.g., 
MMEJ- mediated deletions, NHEJ- mediated translocations and in-
versions, and chromosome arm truncations) make both the unbi-
ased detection and modeling more challenging than in the yeast 
system. In addition, SVs in yeast appear to be confined to a specific 
subset of the genome where they occur systematically at a very high 
rate, such that most of the genome exhibits little- to- no detectable 
SV formation. In contrast, studies on mammalian systems have re-
ported large deletions across a wide range of frequencies for all tar-
get sites thus far examined, ranging from 0.2 to 17.5%, depending 
on the chromosomal context and cell type (9). These deletions ap-
pear to be largely driven by microhomologies that cannot be readily 
predicted by sequence context alone (25). Key questions remain un-
answered about whether SV rates vary across the genome and 
whether there are SV hotspots in mammalian genomes as we found 
in yeast. It is likely that existing studies have not examined a suffi-
ciently large or representative set of genomic sites for building pre-
dictive models for editing outcomes. Future efforts should focus on 
developing scalable approaches to map the wide range of possible 
SVs observed in mammalian systems.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Y east strains
The BY- derived haploid strain DHY214 was used as the base strain 
for editing with MAGESTIC, with additional modifications on the 
landing pad of genome- integrated barcodes depending on the edit-
ing system version. A complete list of the genomic landing pads and 
plasmid backbones is shown in table S10.
Genome editing and barcoding
We performed highly multiplexed and parallel editing of the de-
signed variants using published protocols (16), with adjustments 
depending on the version of the editing system. Libraries of gRNA 
and donor DNA pairs were designed to incorporate polymorphisms 
present in strains RM11 or SK1 relative to the S288C reference ge-
nome. We tested the performance of three successive improvements 
to our MAGESTIC editing system, named MAGESTIC v1.1, v1.2, 
and v1.3 (n = 81, 471, and 1323, respectively), for the installation of 
several natural variant libraries. Compared with MAGESTIC v1.0 
(n  =  52), the newer versions were optimized by replacing the 
galactose- inducible GAL1 promoter with the constitutive TEF1 pro-
moter for Cas9 expression (v1.1), replacing the tRNA(Tyr)- HDV 
promoter with the SNR52 promoter for gRNA expression (v1.2), 
and adding a tetracycline- inducible RPR1- TetO promoter (59) to 
drive expression of the gRNA used for the barcoding step to tempo-
rally separate editing from barcoding (v1.3). A barcode reference 
table was constructed for each library by amplifying the guide- 
donor- barcode region from the plasmid libraries at the first stage of 
cloning (before inserting the sgRNA scaffold and markers in be-
tween the gRNA and the donor) with indexed Illumina primers.
Recombinase- directed indexing
Edited and barcoded yeast library pools were plated from glycerol 
stocks onto YPD plates and grown for 2 days at 30°C. Single colonies 
were randomly selected and arrayed into 384- well plates using an 
automated colony picking robot (RapidPick Lite, Hudson Robotics). 
After an overnight growth at 30°C, four 384- well plates were com-
bined into a 1536- well array using a Singer RoToR HDA (Singer In-
struments, UK) and used for REDI. Briefly, the MAT α haploid 
strains were mated with barcoded MAT a REDI strains arrayed in 
1536- well format using the Singer RoToR. Through Cre- induced re-
combination of the barcode locus (induced by pinning on SC- 
URA  +  GAL plates), a single allele in the diploid strain contains 
both the editing barcode (informing on the installed variant) from 
the MATα strain, and the 1536- well plate index barcode from the 
MATa parent. To determine the position of specific edited variants 
on the array, the mated cells were washed off the plate, genomic 
DNA was extracted with a kit (Epicentre), and the barcode locus 
was amplified via PCR using indexed Illumina primers. The result-
ing reads (sequenced on Illumina MiSeq system, 2 × 150 bp) were 
merged using BBMerge ( 60), plate positions were identified via 
mapping of index barcodes to the set of available index barcodes 
(only perfect matches considered), and variants were identified by 
mapping the MAGESTIC barcode to the barcode reference table.
For clones generated with the v1.3 system REDI batch 2 (table S1), 
two separate PCRs were necessary to map MAGESTIC barcodes to 
index barcodes due to a different structure of the barcode locus. 
Here, the first amplicon linked the MAGESTIC barcode and the do-
nor DNA fragment, whereas the second amplicon linked the index 
barcode and the donor DNA. MAGESTIC barcodes were mapped to 
index barcodes by aligning donors from each amplicon to the set of 
designed donors using BLAST+ (61).
The selected set of variants was picked with a colony picker using 
the index barcode information and rearrayed into 96- well microwell 
plates, grown overnight, and stored as glycerol stocks. Selection cri-
teria included that each variant be represented with a maximum of 
four barcodes, without sequence errors in the gRNA sequences 
(batches 1 and 2), and without sequence errors in the 60- nucleotide 
(nt) region centered on the target mutation in the donor DNA re-
gion (batch 2). In batch 1, we allowed sequence errors anywhere in 
the donor DNA to assess the impact of synthetic donor errors on

editing efficiency and rate of incorporation of the donor errors into 
the genomic edits
WGS library construction
Selected strains were inoculated into 100 μl of YPAD from glycerol 
stock and grown overnight at 30°C, 800 rpm. WGS libraries were 
prepared using our extraction- free method (18) and, following the 
protocol described in File S1, adapted to a 96- well format. We used 
the triple mutant homemade Tn5 and the protocol version with Pro-
teinase K treatment for nucleosome dissociation. Magnetic bead 
cleanup after Proteinase K treatment was performed on a liquid 
handling robot (Biomek Fxp, Beckman Coulter), while samples 
from the entire plate were pooled for cleanup after the PCR step. 
Samples were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq platform using 2 × 
150- bp reads, at an estimated coverage of 5×. As the site of the target 
edit is known by virtue of the MAGESTIC barcode, we reasoned 
that such low coverage is sufficient to detect the editing outcome at 
the target site.
Read data processing and editing outcome identification
Raw reads in FASTQ format were processed by trimming off adapter 
sequences using cutadapt (62) and mapped to the sacCer3.0 refer -
ence genome (http://sgd- archive.yeastgenome.org/sequence/S288C_ 
reference/genome_releases/S288C_reference_genome_R64- 2- 1_  
20150113.tgz) using bwa- mem (63). The mapped BAM (Binary 
Alignment/Map) files were sorted and marked for PCR duplicates, 
and the base quality scores were recalibrated using GATK4 (64).
Following successful MAGESTIC barcoding, a portion of the 
guide- donor plasmid, including the full- length donor template, in-
tegrates into the genome at the landing pad. Reads overlapping the 
barcode region can be partially mapped to the target site due to se-
quence similarity in the gRNA and donor region, leading to false 
discovery of intended edits. To prevent this, a custom script was 
implemented to filter out reads containing chimeric junctions, 
which suggest origins from barcode sequences or residual plasmid 
fragments in the WGS libraries. Last, variant calling was performed 
using GATK4 HaplotypeCaller (SNV and indel) and SvABA (65) 
(SV), followed by downstream analysis to define different categories 
of editing outcomes.
To distinguish intended from unintended variants at the target 
sites and account for incomplete editing of MNVs, we developed an 
annotation method based on edit distances (Levenshtein). A variant 
is classified as intended if its addition to a wild- type sequence re-
duces the edit distance to the donor template; otherwise, it is classi-
fied as unintended. This approach also characterizes editing status 
of oligo synthesis errors by treating them as additional designed 
variants on donor templates. A schematic of the variant definition is 
shown in figs. S20 and S21.
SV identification and annotation
Short read- based algorithms for SV detection are known to be sub-
optimal under certain conditions (e.g., repetitive or highly mutated 
regions, low sequencing depth) that lead to low recall and high false- 
positive rates (66). In this study, we used a three- way cross- validation 
approach to ensure accurate SV annotation across diverse target 
contexts. Potential SVs were preselected by three methods indepen-
dently: (i) on- target deletions or translocations identified by SvABA; 
(ii) unintended SNVs or indels within 200 bp up-  or downstream of 
the target site identified by GATK4 HaplotypeCaller; and (iii) copy 
number loss detected by reduced read coverage at the target site. 
Subsequently, regions containing at least one of these signatures 
were visually inspected and compared to unedited controls in the 
IGV (Integrative Genomics Viewer) (67) to confirm true SVs.
Copy number changes at target sites were assessed using a 
custom script. Binned coverage metrics were computed for each 
WGS sample with a 250- bp bin size, resulting in an m  × n matrix, 
where m is the number of samples and n  is the number of bins. 
Raw read counts were normalized for library size variation using 
DESeq2 (68), yielding a matrix X = /parenleft.s1x1,1 ⋯x1,m ⋮⋱⋮ xn,1 ⋯xn,m
/parenright.s1 , 
where xi,j denotes the normalized read count in bin i  of sample  
j. These counts were then converted to ranks across bins: R i,j =  
rank of xi,jin (x1,j,x2,j,…x n,j)
n ,(i= 1, 2… n ) . The inverse of R i,j reflects the 
likelihood of a region being under- sequenced, indicating poten -
tial copy number loss. To rule out background variation in read 
depth (e.g., from Tn5 insertion bias or GC content), the “rank of 
rank” (RoR) was computed to normalize ranks across samples: 
RoR i,j=
rank of Ri,j in (Ri,1,Ri,2,…R i,m )
m  , 
/parenleft.s1j=1, 2… m /parenright.s1
 . Bins with RoR  < 
0.1 were considered as signals of copy number loss.
To identify corresponding regions involved in repair at SV loci, 
reads containing unexpected variants relative to the target site (SNVs, 
soft- clipped sequences) were aligned against the reference genome 
using blastn (61) (table S2). On the basis of the location of detected 
hits, the variants were classified as deletions or translocations. In case 
of translocations, the alignment of the template regions was inspect-
ed in IGV to search for potential reciprocal translocations.
Analysis of off- target mutations
Genomic Call Variant Format (GVCF) files were generated from the 
BAM files of 2260 genomes and combined into a single file using the 
“GenotypeGVCFs” command of GATK4. Variants in the combined 
VCF (Call Variant Format) file were filtered to exclude low- quality 
calls with the expression “QD < 2.0 || FS > 60.0 || MQ < 40.0 || SOR > 
3.0 || MQRankSum <  −12.5 || ReadPosRankSum <  −8.0. ” Addi-
tional filters were applied to exclude the following: (i) variant loci 
with missing genotype “ . ” in >50% of samples; (ii) samples with 
missing genotypes “ . ” in >50% of loci; and (iii) variants shared across 
multiple samples with different gRNA sequences. For the remaining 
variant loci, genomic sequences ±25 bp around the PAM site were 
extracted and aligned to the gRNA sequence (20 nt  + NGG) using 
the semiglobal algorithm (gaps are allowed at the beginning or ends 
of the shorter gRNA sequence but not the longer genomic sequence). 
Alignments were performed in both forward and reverse direction, 
with the best hit retained per locus. The edit distance between the 
best hit and the gRNA sequence is depicted in fig. S4B.
Quantifying genomic repetitiveness using local and distal 
repetitiveness indexes (ILR, IGR)
For any given genomic location, the local sequence repetitiveness 
score ILR [as originally defined and termed as Ir (27)] was calculated 
for a defined window size (50 bp, 100 bp, 500 bp, 1 kb, 5 kb, or 10 kb) 
centered at the target site (defined as the first nucleotide of the PAM 
sequence). ILR describes the complexity of a given DNA sequence by 
the length of the shortest unique substring at each base position. 
Inspired by this concept, we developed a custom script to compute 
IGR, which quantifies the global repetitiveness through mapping the 
shortest unique substrings between a target region (50 bp, 100 bp, 
500 bp, 1 kb, 5 kb, or 10 kb) and the rest of the genome. The script is

embedded in the feature table preparation step of the SCORE work-
flow (https://github.com/shli- embl/MAGESTIC- SCORE). Tandem 
repeat length was defined as the longest homologous sequence (with 
a maximum of one mismatch) between the left and right PAM- 
adjacent regions (with 25 bp, 50 bp, 250 bp, 500 bp, 2.5 kb, or 5 kb 
per arm), excluding matches in opposite strand directions (i.e., ex-
cluding inverted repeats).
Predictive model construction
Featurization
Three sets of genomic features describing the target- specific context 
and two technical variables (designed variant type and editing sys-
tem) were included in the training of SCORE (table S5) to regress out 
confounding effects. Feature subset 1 includes all metrics relevant to 
the local sequence context of a targeted site (20 bp gRNA sequence 
±5 bp, GC content, and T homopolymer score). Feature subset 2 in-
cludes chromatin accessibility and transcriptional and histone modi-
fication status. Feature subset 3 includes metrics of repetitiveness and 
target location on chromosome (distance to telomere and centro-
mere). Feature table preparation is detailed in Supplementary Text. 
Features applied for each SCORE predictor were determined based 
on evaluating gradient- boosted decision tree (GBDT) performance 
across all six combinations of the three feature subsets (fig. S10).
Hyperparameter tuning
To determine the optimal model for our task, we conducted a pilot 
analysis comparing four algorithms: (i) GBDT, (ii) random forest, 
(iii) L1- regularized logistic regression, and (iv) L2- regularized logis-
tic regression. A grid search was performed for hyperparameter 
tuning. Model performance was evaluated using repeated k- fold 
cross validation (repeat = 5, k = 3). The selection criteria included 
AUROC, AUPRC, and F1 score. Algorithm- specific hyperparame-
ters included the following: (i) number of trees, learning rate, and 
interaction depth for GBDT; (ii) number of trees and random vari-
ables at each split (mtry) for random forest; and (iii) the penalizing 
factor λ for L1-  and L2- regularized regressions.
We tested a set of strategies to address class imbalance in the train-
ing data (more correctly edited loci, fewer SVs, and unedited sites), 
including (i) random undersampling (RUS) of the majority class, (ii) 
random oversampling (ROS) of the minority class, (iii) Synthetic Mi-
nority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) (69) oversampling of the 
minority class, and (iv) ADASYN (Adaptive Synthetic Sampling ap-
proach) (70) oversampling of the minority class. Undersampling was 
treated as a hyperparameter with levels of 10, 20, 50, and 100% of the 
original majority class size. Each level was combined with one of the 
oversampling techniques (RUS  +  ROS, RUS  +  SMOTE, and 
RUS + ADASYN) or applied alone (RUS only) to achieve a 1:1 class 
ratio in the training set. These adjustments were applied only to the 
training data, while validation splits (within cross- validation) re-
mained unchanged for evaluation. The optimal hyperparameter com-
bination is outlined in table S6. Final predictors were trained by using 
the complete dataset without a separate validation split. The output 
predicted value was min- max normalized to be displayed in the range 
from 0 to 1, i.e., SCORE- SV  =  (model output  −  SCORE- SVmin)/
(SCORE- SVmax −  SCORE- SVmin), where min and max correspond to 
minimum and maximum values observed on the reference genome.
Feature importance assessment
Feature importance was defined based on permutations. Briefly, val-
ues of individual or grouped features were randomly shuffled across 
samples, and the difference in AUROC before and after shuffling 
quantified the feature’s contribution to model performance. Each 
test included 1000 permutations. The resulting AUROC values were 
used to determine 90% confidence intervals.
Functional annotations of genomic regions
Annotations of protein- coding, noncoding (tRNA or ncRNA), telo-
meric, and transposable element regions were extracted from the S288C 
gene annotation file (as part of the downloaded reference genome files 
at http://sgd- archive.yeastgenome.org/sequence/S288C_reference/ 
genome_releases/S288C_reference_genome_R64- 2- 1_20150113.tgz). 
These elements were mapped to 873,419 NGG sites across the S288C 
genome. NGG sites not overlapping with any of the elements were 
categorized as intergenic.
Sites overlapping protein- coding genes were further stratified 
based on essentiality. The list of essential genes was downloaded from 
yeastMine (via the AllianceMine website: https://alliancegenome.
org/bluegenes/alliancemine) using the “Retrieve all phenotypes 
for all genes” panel, followed by “View - > View Rows” and filtering 
for entries where “Phenotype Observable” equals “inviable. ” TATA 
box containing genes, known to enrich for stress responsive genes, 
were extracted from a previous publication (29) (see table S2 in the 
noted reference).
SV hotspot identification
An SV hotspot was defined as a cluster of NGG PAM sites in close 
proximity, which exhibited a high SV likelihood predicted by 
SCORE. Specifically, adjacent NGG PAMs with SCORE- SV > 0.15 
on either chromosomal strand were grouped into clusters. Clusters 
containing fewer than 10 consecutive SV signals were excluded. 
Last, the remaining clusters within 200 bp of each other were merged 
to form SV hotspots, as listed in table S8.
Natural SV breakpoint analysis
The list of 4809 natural SVs was downloaded from the original pub-
lication ( 31) as a supplementary table. SV- type annotations were 
retained as reported in the source, comprising six categories: con-
traction, duplication, deletion, insertion, inversion, and transloca-
tion. For each SV , both the start and end coordinates were considered 
as distinct SV breakpoints, resulting in a total of 9618 breakpoints 
for downstream analysis.
For each SV breakpoint, we defined a ±1050 bp window (i.e., 
from −1050 bp to +1050 bp), where all NGG PAM sites with avail-
able predicted SV scores were extracted. These sites were then 
grouped into 100- bp bins based on their relative distance from the 
SV breakpoints.
As our prediction scores have prefiltered PAM sites associated 
with nonunique guide sequences (i.e., ones that would lead to mul-
tiple cuts in the genome), these excluded positions did not contrib-
ute to the visualization of SV scores. Their distribution across bins 
was instead analyzed separately by quantifying their fraction in each 
100- bp bin (i.e., fig. S14, bottom panel).
MAGESTIC 3.0 editing system for SV- prone targets
We selected eight pairs of gRNA and donor templates causing differ-
ent types of SVs (DEL, FR, and TR) and residing at diverse chromo-
somal locations (table S9). For each target site, the same guide was 
used as that used in the natural variant library. To prevent the pos-
sibility of the guide re- cleaving the target site after editing and

potentially leading to post- edit SV formation, multiple SNVs were 
engineered in the PAM- proximal region of the guide. The guide- 
donor oligos were designed as 200- mers and cloned into plasmid 
backbones as described (35). For the nonplasmid assembly versions, 
the cloned plasmids were transformed directly into yeast (table S10). 
For guide- donor plasmid assembly in yeast, the guide- donor plas-
mids were first digested by I- Sce I in  vitro and the guide- donor 
backbones purified by gel extraction. Two hundred nanograms of 
the resulting linearized guide- donor vectors was transformed with 
200 ng of pF811 insert (for I- Sce I and SaCas9- mediated barcoding) 
(table S10).
All yeast transformations were pelleted in PCR strips, resus-
pended in 50 μl of H2O, and 20 μl was transferred to 480 μl of com-
plete synthetic medium lacking uracil, histidine, and leucine 
(CSM- Ura- His- Leu) in a deep well plate to select for maintenance of 
the Cas9 plasmid, uptake of the guide- donor editing vectors, and 
prevention of premature barcoding, respectively. After 2 days of 
growth at 30°C with shaking at 800 rpm, 16 μl from this first out-
growth was transferred to 484 μl of CSM- Ura- His- Leu for a second 
outgrowth (32- fold dilution to enable five generations). The next 
day, 16 μl was transferred to 484 μl of CSM- Ura- His + galactose 
(instead of glucose) to initiate barcoding and guide- donor plasmid 
self- destruction. For the MAGESTIC 3.0 SaCas9- barcoding system, 
anhydrotetracycline (1 μg/ml) was also added to induce SaCas9 and 
its guide X1. This was repeated for a second barcoding outgrowth. 
Last, 16 μl of the second barcoding outgrowths was inoculated into 
484 μl of CSM- His + 300 μM 5- fluorocytosine to counter- select for 
any cells harboring guide- donor plasmids while simultaneously se-
lecting for successful integration of the HIS3- barcode–containing 
inserts at the chromosomal barcode (REDI) locus. Genomic DNA 
from these cultures was prepped using the MasterPure yeast DNA 
extraction kit (LGC Biosearch Technologies, Inc). WGS libraries 
were prepared with the Illumina DNA prep kit (which uses Bead- 
linked transposons). The libraries were sequenced on the Illumina 
NovaSeq S4 lane by 2 × 151- bp reads by Novogene USA (Davis, CA).
Bulk WGS analysis
Raw sequencing reads were processed and mapped to a customized 
S288C reference genome, incorporating several additional sequenc-
es: (i) guide- donor plasmid, (ii) genomic landing pad of the MAGES-
TIC barcode cassette, and (iii) editing cassette plasmid. Per- base 
read counts for each of the nine regions per sample were generated 
using “samtools depth, ” including unedited sites as control for down-
stream analysis.
Raw read counts were normalized for library size by dividing by 
the mean read depth per sample. Normalized counts were calculat-
ed for both unedited samples (with different gRNAs from the in-
spected site) and the edited sample. Normalized coverage was 
indicated by the ratio of normalized counts in the edited sample to 
that in the unedited control (averaged across all control samples). 
This per- base coverage was binned using a sliding window of length 
adjusted based on region size (window size  = region size/25; step 
size = region size/50). Coverage reduction (Δcoverage) was calcu-
lated as (1 – normalized coverage), reflecting the fraction of bulk 
samples with SVs.
To determine the composition of correct edits and unedited frac-
tions, reads overlapping the targeted variant (or its wild- type se-
quence) were extracted and counted. For each sample, the fraction of 
SV (Δcoverage) was subtracted from 1, and the remaining fraction 
was partitioned into edited and unedited fractions according to the 
ratio of read counts for edited and wild- type alleles.
Creation of independent CRISPR- Cas9 and CRISPR- Cas12a 
libraries using MAGESTIC3.0
An independent library of guide- donor plasmids was generated for 
MAGESTIC 3.0- based editing of all targetable variants in 112 previ-
ously mapped quantitative trait loci with SpCas9, LbCas12a, and im-
pLbCas12a nucleases, as described in a previous study (35). After 
editing and barcoding outgrowths, cells were plated for growth as 
single colonies onto CSM- HIS+5FOA (1 mg/ml) agar and were ar-
rayed with a PIXL robotic colony picker (Singer Instruments, UK). 
The integrated genomic barcodes for each clone were identified using 
REDI (as described above). Clones with barcodes corresponding to 
sequence- perfect guide and donor sequences were identified for a re-
array step, followed by stamping with the ROTOR (Singer Instru-
ments, UK) [growth in 100 μl of YPD  + G418 (100 μg/ml) 96- well 
format for genomic DNA extractions and −80°C archival in 384- well 
plates filled with 60 μl of YPD + G418 (100 μg/ml) +15% glycerol].
The integrated genomic barcode per clone was extracted from 
WGS data and mapped to a reference table to identify correspond-
ing gRNA and donor DNA sequences. Clones without barcode in-
formation or with ambiguous barcodes were excluded. For the 
remaining 1122 clones, raw read processing, mapping, and outcome 
calling were conducted as described above for the 2260 clones, with 
modification to the reference genome to include variants specific to 
the editing base strain version used in this editing experiment.
For the CRISPR- Cas9 library, no edit, SV , DEL, and TRA predic-
tion scores were extracted from the precomputed table available on 
the SCORE app website (https://apps.embl.de/score/). Predictions 
for the CRISPR- Cas12a library were performed using our workflow 
described above, with input coordinates adjusted to align with the 
format used for Cas9 datasets.
Mapping SV- prone sites throughout the Sc2.0 genome
Sc2.0 genome sequences and annotation files were downloaded 
from the project website (https://syntheticyeast.github.io/sc2- 0/
data/). The loxP site distance was defined as the base pair distance 
between the two adjacent loxP sites upstream and downstream of 
the analyzed NGG site. SCORE predictions for SV , DEL, and TRA 
were generated for all NGGs in the 16 synthetic chromosomes using 
the models trained on the 1875 WGS datasets.
