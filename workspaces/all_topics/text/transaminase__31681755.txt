Transaminases are pyridoxal-5 ′-phosphate (PLP) binding enzymes, broadly studied
for their potential industrial application. Their afﬁnity for PLP has been related to
their performance and operational stability and while sign iﬁcant differences in PLP
requirements have been reported, the environment of the PLP -binding pocket is highly
conserved. In this study, thorough analysis of the residue i nteraction network of three
homologous transaminases Halomonas elongata (HeTA), Chromobacterium violaceum
(CvTA), and Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens (PfTA) revealed a single residue difference in their
PLP binding pocket: an asparagine at position 120 in HeTA. N1 20 is suitably positioned
to interact with an aspartic acid known to protonate the PLP p yridinium nitrogen,
while the equivalent position is occupied by a valine in the o ther two enzymes. Three
different mutants were constructed (HeTA-N120V , CvTA-V12 4N, and PfTA-V129N) and
functionally analyzed. Notably, in HeTA and CvTA, the aspar agine variants, consistently
exhibited a higher thermal stability and a signiﬁcant decre ase in the dissociation constant
(Kd) for PLP , conﬁrming the important role of N120 in PLP binding. Moreover, the reaction
intermediate pyridoxamine-5 ′-phosphate (PMP) was released more slowly into the bulk,
indicating that the mutation also enhances their PMP bindin g capacity. The crystal
structure of PfTA, elucidated in this work, revealed a tetra meric arrangement with the PLP
binding sites near the subunit interface. In this case, the V 129N mutation had a negligible
effect on PLP-binding, but it reduced its temperature stabi lity possibly destabilizing the
quaternary structure.

INTRODUCTION
Pyridoxal 5 ′-phosphate (PLP) is the biologically active form of vitamin B 6 and plays a key role in
the enzymatic mechanism of a variety of biochemical reactio ns (
Percudani and Peracchi, 2003;
Eliot and Kirsch, 2004 ). PLP-dependent enzymes were initially classiﬁed in ﬁve diﬀere nt fold
types, which were originally used to explain their diﬀerent reac tion speciﬁcities, but after further
analysis, PLP-dependent enzymes are now classiﬁed in seven d iﬀerent major groups ( Dunathan,
1966; Grishin et al., 1995; Percudani and Peracchi, 2009 ).
Roura Padrosa et al. Improvement of ω -TAs PLP-Binding by Point Mutation
One of the most important groups among PLP-dependent
enzymes are transaminases (TAs). These enzymes catalyze th e
transfer of an amino group from an amino donor to an amino
acceptor. In short, the reaction starts with a holo-enzyme
complex where PLP is initially bound to the enzyme through
an imine bond with the ε-NH2 of the catalytic lysine (internal
aldimine). This complex then reacts with the amine donor
forming an external aldimine that after hydrolysis gives ri se to
pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP) and the deaminated product.
If PMP remains at the active site, it readily interacts with the
amine acceptor to form the aminated product and then returns to
the holo-form of the enzyme (PLP-bound) to start a new cataly tic
cycle (Figure 1).
In recent years, TAs have attracted interest for the producti on
of high value chemicals (
Höhne and Bornscheuer, 2009; Kohls
et al., 2014; Guo and Berglund, 2017 ). Broadly speaking, TAs
can be divided into α - or ω -transaminases ( ω TAs), depending
on the position of the amino group transferred with respect to
the carboxyl group of the substrate (
Mathew and Yun, 2012 ).
ω TAs which belong to the aminotransferase III family (EC
2.6.1.X, PF00202), oﬀer a greener, safer and scalable approach for
the synthesis of several pharmaceutical building blocks. Des pite
numerous eﬀorts made for studying and optimizing TAs, only
two variants have been implemented in industrial processes:
ATA117, anR-selective transaminase engineered to be used in the
industrial production of sitagliptin (
Savile et al., 2010 ) and an S-
selective transaminase from Arthobacter citreus for the synthesis
of aminotetralin and the production of acetophenone ( Martin
et al., 2007 ). Major drawbacks for the industrial implementation
of transaminases are related to their catalytic activity, a nd more
importantly to their unfavorable operational stability.
The low operational stability of transaminases in amination
reactions is often explained by the presence of high substrate
concentration, the high amine donor to acceptor ratios, with
the requirement for co-solvents to increase solubility, as well
as PLP requirements to maintain the catalytic cycle. Hence,
enzyme inactivation is partially explained by cofactor loss d uring
prolonged bioconversions of large amount of substrate (
Yun
et al., 2005; Chen et al., 2018b ). This phenomenon compromises
both the activity and stability of transaminases since PLP
and its aminated version, PMP , must remain in the active
site to complete the catalytic cycle (
Chen et al., 2018a ). In
applied biocatalysis the addition of exogenous PLP increases the
operational stability under process intensiﬁcation conditi ons, but
the price of PLP limits the cost eﬃciency of the transaminase-
based bioprocess at large scale. Interestingly, diﬀerent TAs from
diﬀerent sources have varied aﬃnity toward PLP as demonstrat ed
by diﬀerent requirements in terms of exogenous supply of
cofactor (
Mathew and Yun, 2012 ). Our group reported that
ω TA from Halomonas elongata exhibited a 1.5 times higher

total turnover number (TTN) of PLP per molecule of enzyme
than its Chromobacterium violaceum homolog (
Benítez-Mateos
et al., 2018 ); this suggests that the former ω TA binds the
cofactor more strongly than the latter. Protein engineerin g,
by semi-rational mutagenesis, has been applied successfully
to develop more robust transaminase-based biocatalysts to b e
used in industry (
DiSanto et al., 2007; Savile et al., 2010;
Börner et al., 2017a ), but studies speciﬁcally targeting the
optimization of PLP binding are scarce. Often, the optimizati on
for substrate binding and activity causes a lower aﬃnity for
PLP. For example, the transaminase mediated synthesis of
sitagliptin demands 4 times higher PLP supply in the scaled-
up process.
Depending on the origin of the ω TA, PLP binding displays
diﬀerent involvement in favoring energetic protein conforma tion
to eﬃciently perform the catalysis. For example, PLP binding has
a negligible contribution to stabilizing the active confor mation
of the dimeric CvTA yet the cofactor occupies both active site s
(
Humble et al., 2012 ). On the contrary, the active conformation
of a tetrameric enzyme from Pseudomonas sp. becomes highly
stabilized by PLP binding, but the structural data suggest a
cooperative binding of PLP since it only occupies one out of
the four active sites per turnover (
Sayer et al., 2013 ). Despite
the diﬀerent structural consequences induced by PLP binding
on ω TAs, the cofactor interactions within the active site are
very similar ( Figure 2). ω TAs demand a protonated cofactor to
accomplish the catalytic cycle. This protonation state relies on an
aspartate residue which ionically interacts with the pyridin ium
nitrogen (
Eliot and Kirsch, 2004 ). In addition, PLP is tightly
bound to the catalytic site through π -π stacking interactions and
hydrogen bonds established between the aromatic ring and th e
phosphate group, respectively ( Denesyuk et al., 2003 ).
In the present study, we intend to better understand
the molecular interactions that govern PLP binding in three
industrially relevant ω TAs, namely from Halomonas elongata
(HeTA) (
Cerioli et al., 2015 ), Chromobacterium violaceum
(CvTA) ( Kaulmann et al., 2007 ) and Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens
(PfTA) ( Ito et al., 2011; Mutti et al., 2012 ). Careful analysis of
the multi-sequence and structural alignments reveal that H eTA
presents an Asn suitably positioned to interact with either the
pyridinium nitrogen or with an Asp (Asp255) that keeps PLP
protonated. In the equivalent position, the two other studied
enzymes (CvTA and PfTA) have a valine instead. By constructin g
three diﬀerent single mutants (HeTA-N120V , CvTA-V124N and
PfTA-V129N), we gathered experimental evidences that support s
the role of this Asn in PLP binding. This residue appears
to enhance a stable interaction with the cofactor explaining
the higher operational stability of HeTA under high substrat e
and limited PLP concentrations compared to CvTA and PfTA
(
Benítez-Mateos et al., 2018 ).

Crystallization, Data Collection, and
Structure Determination of PfTA
A full length PfTA synthetic construct, cloned in pET-28b
vector (see Supplementary Information), was expressed in the
Escherichia coli BL21 codon plus strain cultured at 37 ◦C in
LB medium. Expression was induced by addition of 1-thio- β -

Cells were lysed by sonication in 45 mM phosphate, pH 7.2,
0.9 M NaCl, 0.09 mM PLP , 9 mM imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol.
Samples were puriﬁed on a HisTrap HP chelating column (GE

was carried out by size-exclusion chromatography using a
Superdex 200 HiLoad 16/60 column (GE Healthcare) pre-
equilibrated with 50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM
PLP , 1% glycerol. Sitting drop vapor diﬀusion crystallizatio n
trials were carried out at 20 ◦C and the best hits were obtained
in conditions G1 and G6 from the LMB screen (Molecular
Dimensions), which were further optimized by varying protein
and precipitant concentrations. Single crystals grew in unde r
a week; the best condition being 6 mg/mL protein (in 50 mM
HEPES, pH 7.5, 300 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM PLP , 1% glycerol, 20 mM
DTT) mixed 1:1 0.1 M sodium citrate, pH 5.6, 12% w/v PEG 6000,
0.1 M lithium sulfate. Crystals were ﬂash cooled after soaki ng in
cryoprotectant solution containing six parts precipitant mixt ure
with four parts glycerol. Diﬀraction data for these crystals w ere
collected on the I24 beamline at the Diamond Light Source
and the structure was solved by molecular replacement using
coordinates from the uncultivated Pseudomonas sp. transaminase
(PDB: 5LHA) as a search model with PHASER.
Model Building, Reﬁnement, and Validation
Model building was conducted using COOT (35), and
reﬁnement using REFMAC5 (
Murshudov et al., 2011 ).
Data collection and reﬁnement statistics are summarized
in supporting Supplementary Table 1. The ﬁnal model was
validated using Molprobity and deposited into the Protein Data
Bank (PDB: 6S54).
The asymmetric unit contained four molecules in a tetrameri c
arrangement, with an average interface of 5428.1 Å 2 between two
subunits within a dimer and 1071.4 Å 2 between a subunit within
one dimer and its nearest neighbor in the opposite dimer using
the PISA server (
Krissinel, 2015 ). Clear electron density for PLP
linkage to K293 was observed in two chains (A and B), whereas
the K293 side chain was less well deﬁned in chains C and D, whic h
may reﬂect a lower occupancy of the cofactor and/or a portion of
the cofactor non-covalently bound to the enzyme. The latter two
chains displayed higher B-factors overall. Figures were prepa red
using VMD (
Humphrey et al., 1996 ) or Pymol ( L DeLano, 2002 ).
Computational Analyses
3-dimensional structure analyses were done using the cryst al
structures of HeTA (PDB: 6GWI) (
Planchestainer et al., 2019 ),
CvTA (PDB: 4A6T), and for PfTA (PDB: 6S54). Residue
interaction analysis was performed using Cytoscape (
Shannon
et al., 2003 ) in combination with StructureViz and RINanalyzer.
MSA and Conservation Scores
For aspartate aminotransferases, multiple sequence alignme nt
was done retrieving all available sequences form the oTAED
(
Buß et al., 2018 ) annotated to be class III transaminases,
corresponding to Pfam PF00202 (24998 sequences in total).
Multiple sequence alignment was performed using ClustalW with
two iterations. The PLP binding site was analyzed using HeTA,
CvTA, and PfTA crystal structures.
For D-alanine aminotransferases (PF01063) and serine
hydroxymethyltransferase (PF00464), the alignment was
retrieved from the Pfam database with a total number of 11,68 9
sequences and 7,460, respectively. The amino acid conservati on
in each position was analyzed using Bioedit and the graphical
visualization was performed with WebLogo (
Crooks et al., 2004 ).
Positions corresponding to the PLP binding site were visuali zed
and analyzed using DAAT from Bacillus sp. YM-1 crystal
structure (PDB: 3DAA) as a model (
Peisach et al., 1998 ) and the
serine hydromethyltransferase from Bacillus stearothermophilus
(PDB: 1KKP) ( Trivedi et al., 2002 ).
Protein Expression and Puriﬁcation
HeTA and CvTA and its mutants were expressed in E. coli
BL21 (DE3) Star in ZYP autoinduction media at 37 ◦C. One
single colony was used for inoculation and left to grow for
20 h before collection. The pellet was collected by centrifuga tion
for 20 min at 4,415 x g and then resuspended in 50 mM
phosphate buﬀer, 0.3 mM NaCl pH8, sonicated for 10 min (in
30 s pulses) and centrifuged 1 h at 22,769 × g to remove the
cell debris. The proteins were puriﬁed by IMAC chromatography
(GE Healthcare, Histrap 5 mL FF) and dialyzed against 50 mM
phosphate buﬀer pH8 overnight (
Kaulmann et al., 2007; Cerioli
et al., 2015 ).
For PfTA and its mutant, the proteins were expressed in
E. coli BL21 (DE3) Star in LB media at 37 ◦C until it reached
an optical density at 600 nm of 0.5–0.7; 0.01 mM of IPTG was
added and the cultures left to grow for 16 h at 21 ◦C. The pellet
was collected by centrifugation for 20 min at 4,415 × g and
then resuspended in 50 mM phosphate buﬀer, 0.1 M NaCl pH7,
sonicated and the cell debris removed by centrifugation for 1 h at
22,769 × g. The protein was puriﬁed by IMAC chromatography
and dialyzed against 50 mM phosphate buﬀer pH7, 0.1 M NaCl
overnight (
Mutti et al., 2012 ).
Protein concentration was calculated using an extinction
coeﬃcient of 62,840 M −1 cm−1 and a molecular weight of
54.4 kDa for the monomer for HeTA, 81,735 M −1 cm−1
and 55.2 kDa for CvTA and 68,340 M −1 cm−1 and 52.5
kDa for PfTA, calculated using ProtParam online resource
(
Gasteiger et al., 2005 ).
Apo and Holo-Form Calculations
The ratio of absorbance Abs415/Abs280 was used to assess the
percentage of holo-form after puriﬁcation, with no external P LP.
For HeTA, CvTA and its mutants the concentration range was
from 5 to 7 mg/mL while for PfTA and its mutant concentration
was 0.7–1.2 mg/mL. The values were compared with the same
sample after incubation for 12 h with 5 mM PLP at 4 ◦C and
1 h at 37 ◦C after elimination of unbound or free PLP using gel
ﬁltration (PD-10 column purchased from GE Healthcare). The
fractions containing the protein were collected and the rati o
Abs415/Abs280 measured ﬁxed as being the 100% holo-form.
Enzyme Activity Assay
The standard assay to measure activity was performed using
2.5 mM pyruvate, 2.5 mM S-MBA and 0.1 mM PLP in phosphate
buﬀer pH8. The reaction was performed indistinctly in 1 mL or
300 µ L ﬁnal volume and monitored at 245 nm on an Epoch
2 microplate reader, and velocities were calculated using an
extinction coeﬃcient of 12,600 M −1 cm−1 for acetophenone. A

unit is deﬁned as the amount of enzyme capable of converting 1
µ mol of substrate per minute.
Cofactor Release Study
To a solution of 0.5 mg/mL of the enzyme, 50 mM benzylamine
and 0.5 mM of PLP were added. The absorbance was measured
every 5 min for 4 h at 395 nm to monitor the depletion of
PLP and at 325 nm to measure the formation of PMP at 25 ◦C
using an Epoch 2 microplate reader. The absorbance values
were normalized by subtracting the minimum absorbance and
dividing by the maximum diﬀerence, so all values ranged betwe en
1 and 0.
Temperature Stability Assays
The diﬀerent proteins at a concentration of 1 mg/mL for CvTA
and HeTA and 0.1 mg/mL of PfTA in their apo-form were
incubated for 30 min at diﬀerent temperatures ranging from 25 t o
65 degrees in 50 mM phosphate buﬀer pH8 without external PLP.
After the incubation, samples were centrifuged to eliminate the
precipitated protein and were left in ice for another 30 min. The
activity was then tested following the formation of acetophe none
at 245 nm with the standard assay.
Melting Temperature and Dissociation
Constant Calculations
Melting temperature (T 1/2) values were calculated using
diﬀerential scanning ﬂuorimetry (DSF) using a BioRad C1000 TM
Thermal cycler and a CFX TM 96 Real Time System measuring the
ﬂuorescence in the range of the SYPRO Orange dye. The sample
consisted of 1 mg/mL apo-form protein, 15x Sypro Orange with
or without 0.25 mM PLP in 50 mM phosphate buﬀer pH8. The
melting temperatures were calculated ﬁtting the data to a two -
state Boltzmann function using GraphPad Prism TM.
Kd values of PLP for the apo form of each protein were
calculated using diﬀerent concentration of PLP (1–250 µ M) in
50 mM phosphate buﬀer pH8. Each sample was prepared with
the desired amount of PLP in the same conditions as before. A
single-site binding was then used to estimate the Kd from the T1/2
values obtained using GraphPad Prism TM.
RESULTS
PfTA Crystal Structure
In order to compare the three enzymes at the molecular level we
crystallized PfTA in the presence of the cofactor, PLP. Data f rom
crystals grown in a condition with PEG6000 as the precipitant
diﬀracted to 2.2 Å resolution and the structure was solved
by molecular replacement ( Supplementary Table 1). The crystal
structure showed a tetrameric arrangement of PfTA with the
cofactor positioned at the interface of two subunits and PLP
linked to K293 ( Figures 3A,B). V129 is well-deﬁned and in
proximity to D264, which is within hydrogen bonding distance
to H159 and the pyridinium nitrogen. The PfTA structure is
most closely related to structures of a TA from an uncultivat ed
Pseudomonas species (PDB: 5LH9, 5LHA;
Börner et al., 2017a )
with which it shares 49% sequence identity. This enzyme also has
a valine at the equivalent position to V129 and displays a simila r
overall tetrameric structure. The structures can be superim posed
with an RMSD of corresponding residues of 1.0 Å over 443
residues ( Supplementary Figure 3 ). On the other hand, HeTA
(PDB: 6GWI) has a sequence identity of 40% and CvTA (PDB:
4A6T) of 36% with RMSDs of 1.5 and 1.8 Å when superimposed,
respectively. We next performed more detailed analysis of the
three enzymes under investigation.
Residue Interaction Analysis and
Conservation
To understand the molecular basis of the diﬀerences between
HeTA, CvTA, and PfTA, we compared their sequences
(Supplementary Figure 1 ) and available 3D structures of
aminotransferase family III. The 3D-structures of the three
studied enzymes were superimposed ( Supplementary Figure 2 )
and all three PLP-binding sites are formed by almost identic al
residues in equivalent positions, matching the expected
geometry previously described for ω -transaminases ( Figure 4A)
(
Łyskowski et al., 2014; Guidi et al., 2018 ). Nonetheless, a
minor but potentially relevant diﬀerence in the PLP-binding
pocket was found through residue interaction analysis (RIN)
(Supplementary Figure 3 ). Interestingly, an Asn at position
120 (N120) of HeTA caught our attention as possibly having
an important role in the interaction network with PLP. This
residue is positioned at an α -helix near the interface between the
two monomers. In contrast, the corresponding residue in PfTA
and CvTA is a valine with no predicted interaction with PLP.
The presence of such an Asn in this position might explain the
stronger binding of PLP in the HeTA active site.
Remarkably, within the same fold type, serine
hydroxymethyltransferases (SHMT, EC 2.1.2.1) or even in fol d
type IV , D-aminoacid aminotransferases (DAAT, EC 2.6.1.21) ,
have a highly conserved Asn in this position ( Figures 4B,C).
These two groups of enzymes also catalyze PLP dependent
reactions in a similar manner as TAs and, although they have
a diﬀerent architecture, the main interactions forming the
PLP-binding pocket are conserved, especially those that rely
on the catalytic lysine, the “phosphate-cup” and the negatively
charged amino acid that interacts with the pyridinium nitrog en
(Supplementary Figure 4 ).
In class III aminotransferases, multi-sequence alignment o f
all entries annotated as such indicated that Asn is not especi ally
conserved in that position. In fact, Asn and Val are similarly
abundant, followed by Thr ( Figure 4C).
Inspection of the superimposed structures shows that the
N120 in HeTA belongs to a second PLP interaction shell that
faces the carboxyl group of the vicinal D255 residue (ﬁrst PL P
interaction shell), known to maintain the cofactor protonat ed
(
Eliot and Kirsch, 2004 ). The distances between D255 and the
pyridinium nitrogen in HeTA is 2.7 Å, whereas the amide-
nitrogen of N120 is positioned at 3.1 Å from the carboxylic gro up
of D255 ( Figure 4B). The vicinity of these residues suggests
that N120 may form a hydrogen bonding interaction with the
carboxyl group of D255. This interaction may help to eﬀective ly
position D255, favoring its electrostatic interaction with the
nitrogen from the pyridinium group of the cofactor and thus,

strengthening the enzyme-PLP supramolecular binding, whic h
would avoid the premature release of both PLP and PMP during
the catalytic cycle. The role of such an acidic amino acid on
PLP binding has been demonstrated by mutational studies whe re
TA variants lacking an Asp or Glu at that position displayed a
signiﬁcantly reduced catalytic eﬃciency (
Wu et al., 2011; Son and
Kim, 2016).
To assess the role of N120 in cofactor binding, three single
mutants of HeTA, CvTA, and PfTA were constructed. HeTA-
N120V aims to disrupt the postulated interaction between N120
and D255, while CvTA-V124N and PfTA-V129N were designed
to mimic the interaction network found in HeTA and were
consequently hypothesized to increase the PLP binding aﬃnit y.
All mutants were successfully created, expressed and puriﬁed
following the same protocol as for the WT enzymes.
Functional Characterization of ω TAs Single
Mutants
UV-Vis spectroscopy was utilized to quantify the holoenzyme
fraction obtained after the overexpression of native and sin gle-
mutants of HeTA, CvTA and PfTA. The internal aldimine
formed by PLP covalently bound to the catalytic lysine shows
an absorption maximum at 415 nm, unlike the free PLP , whose
maximum is at 390 nm (
Chen et al., 2018a ). Based on these
spectral diﬀerences, we quantiﬁed the fraction of puriﬁed ω TA
bound to PLP (holo-form) by comparing 415 and 280 nm
absorbance values ( Supplementary Figure 5 ). To this aim, we
quantiﬁed the holo-form in freshly puriﬁed enzymes (both wild -
type and mutants) incubated or non-incubated with exogenous
PLP (
Chen et al., 2018a ). The former samples were considered as
the maximum achievable fraction of holo-form (100%) where al l
enzymes contain a covalently linked PLP molecule per subunit .
To estimate the occupancy of PLP in freshly produced enzymes,
the absorbance at 415 nm was normalized by the concentration of
protein in mM. The values for the sample puriﬁed without PLP
were compared with maximum theoretical occupancy ( Table 1).
WT-HeTA exhibited the highest holo-form fraction ( ∼70%)
and occupancy values (1.39) of all TAs herein studied. On the
other hand, PfTA presented a 40% initial holo-form and an
occupancy value of ∼1.6 while only 16% of CvTA appeared to
have PLP bound, with an occupancy value of 0.3, which suggests
that most CvTA molecules lack PLP. Interestingly, the HeTA-
N120V mutant had nearly a 20% decrease of the holo-form
which translates to a lower occupancy but introducing an Asn i n
CvTA-V124N and PfTA-V129N resulted in enzyme preparations
with similar fraction of initial holo-form and occupancy as t heir
native counterparts.
To further investigate the aﬃnity of these enzymes toward
PLP , the PLP dissociation constant ( Kd) was calculated ( Table 1)
from the midpoint denaturation point (T 1/2) at diﬀerent
concentrations of PLP. Kd is an equilibrium constant used to
deﬁne the binding aﬃnity of an enzyme for a ligand, in this cas e
PLP. A lower value for Kd indicates a higher binding aﬃnity
of the enzyme for PLP. HeTA exhibited a similar Kd value
as the tetrameric PfTA but a 5 times lower value than WT-
CvTA. When PLP aﬃnity was determined for the mutants, we
observed that replacing N120 by a valine in HeTA decreased the
aﬃnity toward the cofactor by 3-fold. Remarkably, CvTA-V124 N
had a signiﬁcant increase in the PLP binding capacity, with
nearly 3-fold lower Kd than the wild-type enzyme. The CvTA-
V124N new variant showed a Kd comparable to that of WT-
HeTA and WT-PfTA. These results suggest that N120 of HeTA
reinforces the interaction network of the acidic residues t hat
anchors the pyridinium ion of PLP ( Figure 4A). Surprisingly,
the introduction of N into the corresponding position in PfTA
(V129N variant) only negligibly aﬀected the PLP binding aﬃni ty.
The engineering of CvTA to CvTA-V124N indeed improves the
enzyme aﬃnity toward the cofactor, but such improvement was
not observed for PfTA, likely because the contribution of tha t
interaction is less relevant in a tetrameric TA.
Moreover, the eﬀect of PLP aﬃnity on the functionality
of the enzyme was assessed by measuring the speciﬁc activity
of all native and single-mutated variants with and without
exogenous cofactor (Figure 5). For both native and N120V HeTA
variants, the exogenous addition of PLP marginally aﬀected t he
speciﬁc activity, implying that HeTA operates at its maximum

capacity when more than half of the active sites are occupied
by PLP. However, the saturation of CvTA active sites with PLP
signiﬁcantly increased its speciﬁc activity for both native and
mutated (V124N) variants. Unexpectedly, in the case of PfTA,
we observed that the WT variant displayed a 2-fold increase in
its speciﬁc activity under saturating PLP conditions like Cv TA,
but the activity of the variant PfTA-V129N was insensitive t o the
exogenous addition of PLP.
From these results, we conclude that HeTA activity is less
dependent on exogenous PLP than native PfTA and CvTA.
HeTA-N120V showed a similar speciﬁc activity as the native
enzyme, despite the mutation decreasing the PLP-binding
aﬃnity. These data suggest that the mutation does not aﬀect
the catalytic eﬃciency of the enzyme but may promote a
premature dissociation of the cofactor that can negatively i mpact
on the biocatalyst stability and recyclability. Therefore , N120 may
promote tighter binding of PLP and PMP within HeTA active
site. The role of this Asn on the PLP binding is also supported
by the fact that CvTA-V124N was slightly more active than the
native variant under PLP limiting conditions. The activiti es of
both native and mutated enzymes were equal when saturated
with the cofactor. However, the same mutation on PfTA made
that variant insensitive to the cofactor concentration, un like the
native enzyme which increased its activity under PLP satura ting

conditions. While the introduction of an Asn into CvTA makes
an enzyme with similar PLP aﬃnity as the native HeTA, the
same mutation into PfTA achieves the PLP insensitivity obse rved
in HeTA.
PMP Release in the Absence of the Amino
Acceptor
To further comprehend the eﬀect of the Asn residue, the ﬁrst
half reaction of the transaminase catalytic cycle was studi ed by
measuring the absorbance at 390 nm for PLP and 325 nm for
PMP in absence of amine acceptor (
Börner et al., 2016 ). Using
these values, the depletion of PLP and formation of PMP in
the bulk were monitored for 4 h ( Supplementary Figure 6 ). The
initial release of cofactor is shown in Figure 6.
In the assayed conditions, PLP reacts with the amine donor
to yield PMP which is only stabilized through non-covalent
binding. Therefore, a higher aﬃnity of the aminated cofacto r
corresponds to a lower rate of PMP accumulation in the
bulk. Likewise, a high rate for PMP formation indicates that
the active site of the enzyme is exchanging more rapidly the
PMP molecules formed during the ﬁrst half of the catalytic
cycle, leaving it accessible for other exogenous PLP molecul es
to start a new ﬁrst-half cycle. Since the carbonyl acceptor is
missing, the catalytic cycle cannot be completed, forcing th e
accumulation of PMP in (and depletion of PLP from) the
reaction media.
HeTA-N120V produces PMP ∼1.5 times faster than wild
type HeTA over the ﬁrst 60 min, with a much steeper increase
in the formation during the ﬁrst 20 min ( Figure 6). Similarly,
CvTA aminates PLP ∼2.15 times faster than CvTA-N120V. These
results indicate that PMP is less tightly bound and more easil y
leaves the active sites in the variants lacking the targeted Asn.
In summary, in the absence of a stabilizing Asn residue (HeTA -
N120V and WT-CvTA), the PMP is more rapidly released to the
reaction bulk.
Thermal Stability of Transaminases Under
PLP Limiting Conditions
To investigate the implications of this mutation on the stabi lity
of the three ω -transaminases herein studied, HeTA, CvTA, and
PfTA and their corresponding single mutants were incubated
for 30 min at diﬀerent temperatures without external addition of
PLP ( Figure 7). The activity of the samples was then measured
and compared with the value obtained for the same sample at
30◦C. The thermal inactivation was performed with the enzymes
puriﬁed without exogenous PLP to evaluate the resistance of th e
PLP-enzyme interaction.
Expectedly, HeTA-N120V was signiﬁcantly less stable
than its native counterpart, due to the lower aﬃnity for
PLP and CvTA-V124N was more stable than the WT-
CvTA, indicating that the mutation stabilizes the protein
because of stronger PLP binding. However, the mutation
negligibly aﬀected PfTA ’s thermal stability below 50 ◦C,
but at higher temperatures the residual activity of PfTA-
V129N was noticeably lower than for the wild type
(Figure 7C).
The data obtained from the thermal incubation assays
might reﬂect conformational changes that drive the loss of
enzyme activity. The structural rearrangements may be rela ted
to the dissociation of the PLP-enzyme complex, leaving a
catalytically inactive form, rather than the protein unfold ing.
In the HeTA-N120V variant, the lack of interaction between
N120 and D255 seems to weaken the PLP-enzyme interaction,
promoting a premature release of the cofactor that diminishes
the protein’s conformational stability, causing its inacti vation.
Aligned with these results, the introduction of an Asn in
the homologous position of CvTA increases its thermal
stability, likely due to the reinforcement of the enzyme-PLP
complex. These insights agree with inactivation studies that
demonstrate that this enzyme was more stable when the
incubation was performed in presence of an excess of PLP
(
Chen et al., 2018a ).
Unexpectedly, PfTA showed the opposite behavior since
the variant V129N was less thermally stable than the native
enzyme. As it assembles as a tetramer, the mutation may
negatively aﬀect the quaternary structure as it does not aﬀect t he
stabilization of the enzyme-PLP complex. PfTA has 49% sequenc e

sp. (PsTA) whose crystal structure has been resolved ( Börner
et al., 2017b ). In both cases, the corresponding Val residues
(V129 in PfTA and V119 in PsTA) are part of an alpha helix
located near to the oligomerization interface; between two
monomers and near to the dimer-dimer interaction. Therefor e,
the replacement of that Val by an Asn may disrupt some
crucial hydrophobic interactions required for the assembly of
the quaternary structure needed for the enzyme stability, b ut
also for the enzyme activity under PLP saturation condition s

Thermodynamic Unfolding of
Transaminases
Functional inactivation may be explained by either structur al
rearrangements, which decrease both substrate and cofacto r
aﬃnities or by quaternary structure disassembly without th e
loss of folding of each subunit. However, both minor structu ral
distortions caused by the cofactor release and the loss of
quaternary structure speed up the protein unfolding as seen
for other TAs (
Humble et al., 2012; Börner et al., 2017b ). To
investigate whether lower aﬃnities for PLP also promote protei n
unfolding, we performed thermodynamic denaturation studie s
Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www.front iersin.org 9 October 2019 | Volume 7 | Article 282
Roura Padrosa et al. Improvement of ω -TAs PLP-Binding by Point Mutation
to calculate the melting temperatures of the herein studied
ω TAs and their mutants. The melting or half-life temperature
(T1/2) corresponds to the temperature at which 50% of the
population is unfolded, assuming a two-state transition stat e
model. T1/2, values in the absence or presence of exogenous PLP ,
were calculated by diﬀerential scanning ﬂuorometry using Sy pro
Orange dye ( Figure 8) to assess the eﬀect of the ligand.
Under limiting PLP conditions, the removal of N120 in HeTA
shifted the T 1/2 signiﬁcantly, as HeTA-N120V showed a decrease
of 9 ◦C compared to the T 1/2 of the native enzyme. Under PLP
saturating conditions, the mutant T 1/2 was only 3 ◦C lower than
the wild type. These results, in combination with the fact tha t
the mutant presents a lower percentage of holo-enzyme ( Table 1)
and lower thermal stability ( Figure 7A), supports the postulated
role of the studied Asn in the PLP binding and the stability of TAs.
In the case of CvTA-V124N however, the mutation did not
protect the enzyme from thermal denaturation in the absence o f
exogenous PLP , but both the mutant and the wild-type showed
a 3 ◦C increase in T 1/2 under saturation conditions. In this case,
lower PLP aﬃnities do not trigger enzyme inactivation throu gh
unfolding but, more likely, through the premature dissociat ion
of the cofactor ( Figure 7B).
Like in the stability tests ( Figure 7C), PfTA-V129N tends to
unfold at a T 1/2 value 3 ◦C lower than WT-PfTA does, under
limiting PLP conditions. A similar trend was found under PLP
saturating conditions as T 1/2 values of both native and mutant
variants were higher. Nevertheless, the mutant unfolded at 5◦C
less than the native variant. Here the mutation has deleterio us
eﬀect on the protein stability, which is more dramatic in the
presence of exogenous PLP. In this case, the presence of the
Asn seems to promote enzyme destabilization at both function al
(Figure 7C) and structural levels ( Figure 8).
DISCUSSION
The capacity of transaminases to bind PLP is linked to their
operational stability. During the ﬁrst half of the transamin ase

PfTA and its mutants is presented in the absence of exogenous PLP and with
0.25 mM PLP in the reaction buffer. The /Delta1T1/2 is measured compared to the
WT variant for each protein. The T 1/2 without PLP of the wild-type enzyme

62.9◦C for PfTA).
reaction cycle, PLP is aminated giving rise to PMP that is less
tightly bound to the active site. Hence, the aminated cofact or
can be more easily dissociated from the active site, turning the
enzyme into its apo-form, which is more prone to inactivation,
unfolding or even precipitation. HeTA, a dimeric transaminas e
from Halomonas elongata, exhibited higher operational stability
than CvTA and PfTA, when used in continuous ﬂow (
Benítez-
Mateos et al., 2018 ). Analysis of the PLP binding pockets in these
three homologous transaminases has elicited key diﬀerences in
their PLP-binding residue interaction network. The Asn res idue
located at position 120 in HeTA ’s primary sequence corresponds
to a Val in the other two wildtypes ω TAs studied. Multi-sequence
alignment of the aminotransferase III family showed that su ch
Asn residue is not particularly conserved. In ω TAs, this position
belongs to a secondary PLP interaction shell that strengthe ns the
PLP-enzyme interaction. The poor conservation of this position
amongst aminotransferase III family members may be due to
divergent evolutionary pathways that can lead to enhanced PL P
binding through alternative mechanisms. For example, ω -TAs
can stabilize the secondary interaction network through ca pping
of the PLP binding pocket with an adjacent subunit in tetramer s
or with hydrophobic clamps that ﬁx ﬂexible loops in dimers
(
Börner et al., 2017a,b ). In HeTA though, the formation of
a hydrogen bond between N120 and D255 is postulated here
to optimize the ionization state of the carboxylic acid group,
strengthening its ionic interaction with the pyridinium moi ety
of protonated PLP. Depending on the nature of the residues
in the secondary shell, PLP aﬃnity may vary amongst ω TAs.
To demonstrate the role of this Asn, we constructed 3 diﬀerent
mutants: HeTA-N120V (designed to disrupt the hypothesized
interaction) in HeTA, and CvTA-V124N and PfTA-V129N
(designed to mimic the interaction predicted in HeTA).
After a substantial set of biochemical studies involving
thermodynamic and kinetic tests, we have gathered suﬃcient
evidence to demonstrate the inﬂuence of N120 on the binding
of PLP. The Kd measurements clearly indicate that the presence
of Asn has a signiﬁcant impact on the cofactor aﬃnity in the
two dimeric structures. The Kd of HeTA-N120V for PLP is
increased more than 2-fold with respect to the WT, and even
more remarkably, the Kd of CvTA-V124N drops almost 3 times
with respect to the WT, approaching the values of the WT-
HeTA and WT-PfTA. For HeTA, this is further supported by the
determined holo-enzyme fraction and PLP occupancy, while the
CvTA-V124N mutant had no improvement in the PLP uptake
during expression. Moreover, the removal of the interactions
between the amide group of N120 and D255 of HeTA seemed
to have a negligible eﬀect on the transaminase activity altho ugh
the cofactor aﬃnity was diminished, which might ultimately have
more implications regarding the stability of the biocatalyst s. In
the light of these results, the role of the targeted Asn seems to be
related to the stability of the holo-enzyme (the active form ) rather
than to the catalytic eﬃciency of ω TAs.
In addition, in the dimeric enzymes, the presence of the
studied Asn also minimized the extraction of PMP from the
active site during the ﬁrst half of the transamination cycle .

et al. (2017b) reported on how PMP-enzyme dissociation is

of transaminases. In this case, the presence of the Asn in the
proximity of the critical Asp residue seems to strengthen the
non-covalent interaction with the pyridinium ion of the cofa ctor
aromatic ring, hampering the loss of PMP and further stabilizi ng
the protein-PMP complex needed to complete the second-half of
the catalytic cycle.
A functional implication of lower PLP aﬃnity amongst the
TAs is reduced thermal stabilities. It has previously been repo rted
that higher thermal stability in ω TAs correlates with higher PLP-
binding aﬃnity, since the bound cofactor reduces the overal l
protein ﬂexibility, conferring it a higher tolerance to dena turation
(
Celej et al., 2003 ). HeTA-N120V was indeed inactivated at lower
temperatures than WT-HeTA. Furthermore, the dissociation o f
PLP might trigger some structural rearrangements and facili tate
protein unfolding as demonstrated by the lower T 1/2 calculated
upon thermal denaturation experiments. These T 1/2 diﬀerences
were mitigated under PLP saturating conditions, where cofa ctor
dissociation was thermodynamically unfavored, avoiding t he
unfolding of the enzyme to some extent. Again, functional da ta
obtained with the CvTA strongly supports these ﬁndings, since
CvTA-V124N became a more thermostable variant than the
wild-type. In the light of these results, the presence of Asn
in CvTA seems to help it avoid inactivation through stronger
cofactor binding rather than through protecting the protein f rom
unfolding. In fact, no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in T 1/2 values was
recorded despite their diﬀerent Kd values for PLP.
The tetrameric PfTA, however, shows signiﬁcantly diﬀerent
behavior. No apparent variation was observed between the WT
and mutant for the Kdof PLP dissociation, or in the formation
of spontaneous holo-form and the PLP occupancy. Moreover,
the thermal stability was not aﬀected. Comparing the Kd values
for PLP , it is notable that PfTA presents a similar aﬃnity
toward PLP as WT-HeTA does. This insight indicates that
PLP binding in PfTA may be governed by the assembly of
the quaternary structure rather than the amino acid present
in the target position. The X-ray structure of PfTA herein
solved, shows that the 4 PLP binding sites are near to the
oligomerization interface, which may link the stability of the
PLP-enzyme complex to the quaternary structure. These resul ts
support the ﬁndings of
Börner et al. (2017b) , who highlighted
that tetrameric transaminases show higher operational stab ilities
due to the formation of stronger cofactor-enzyme complexes,
minimizing the displacement of PMP. The locations of PLP
binding sites might have remarkable implications in terms of
enzymatic activity regulation. As for many other multimeri c
enzymes with active sites positioned near the oligomerizati on
interfaces, we could speculate that PLP may exhibit a cooperat ive
binding mode, in which a suitably high concentration of PLP
is needed to trigger conformational changes which allow for
occupancy of all sites to be achieved. This would explain
the lower PLP occupancy values calculated for both variants
of PfTA despite them having Kd values similar to WT-
HeTA.
On the other hand, it is accepted that cofactor binding relies
on supramolecular π -stacking interactions between the cofactor
aromatic ring and a PLP-ring motif, described for Vibrio ﬂuvialis
(
Shin et al., 2018 ), and shared by CvTA ( Humble et al., 2012 )
and Pseudomonas sp. For the three TAs herein studied, such
interactions mainly rely on a conserved Tyr (Y149 in HeTA,
Y153 in CvTA and Y158 in PfTA), although it seems that the
most stable position of such Tyr changes upon PLP binding
(Figure 9). CvTA possesses another Tyr (Y168) which could
act as a staple, ﬁxing the loop once the PLP is bound to the
active site. A similar structural rearrangement has been ob served
for the TA from Vibrio ﬂuvialis and from Pseudomonas sp
(
Börner et al., 2017b; Shin et al., 2018 ). Interestingly, in PfTA,
an additional Trp residue (W174) seems to further stabilize
the Y159 of the PLP-ring motif into establishing π -π stacking
interactions with the cofactor pyridine ring. In this case, t he
binding loop is also constrained by the interaction with ano ther
subunit of the tetrameric structure ( Supplementary Figure 7 ).
Both factors (the quaternary structure that provides a more r igid
environment typical of tetrameric TAs (
Börner et al., 2017b ), and
the presence of the non-conserved tryptophan in close vicinity
to the tyrosine) might contribute into explaining the high PL P
binding aﬃnity. Recently, mutational studies of the PLP-ring
motif in a homologous ω -transaminase from Pseudomonas sp .
were reported to hamper the dissociation of PMP and retain
the quaternary structure during the catalytic cycle.
Börner et al.
(2017a) targeted the tyrosine clamp to construct more stable
variants, speciﬁcally through stabilizing the enzyme-cofa ctor
complex, overall increasing the enzyme-PMP complex stability.
HeTA, however, does not present any hydrophobic residue
or additional subunits to lock the position of the Y153 in the
π -π stacking interaction, and yet despite that, the Kd value
was similar to PfTA. In HeTA, the Trp of PfTA is replaced

by a proline that hardly interacts with Y149. Therefore, the
stability of the PLP binding in HeTA appears to be better
justiﬁed by the hydrogen bonding between N120 and D255,
as supported by the thermodynamic analysis of PLP binding
and proved by the removal of this residue, which produces a
HeTA variant with signiﬁcantly less aﬃnity toward the cofac tor.
The fact that both the dimeric HeTA and the tetrameric PfTA
have a similar aﬃnity for PLP clearly indicates that HeTA mus t
possess some uncommon traits in the PLP interaction network
which also are key for retaining the non-covalently bound PMP
during the catalytic cycle. Hence, the extraction of PMP , and
the consequent loss of enzyme structural stability, is mini mized
through hydrogen bonding more than by dynamic hydrophobic
interactions, as described before for other well-studied ω TAs
(
Börner et al., 2017a,b ).
In summary, we have here identiﬁed an Asn that is neither
part of the phosphate cup, nor of the PLP-ring bonding motif,
but which clearly plays a key role in PLP-binding. Structural
information conﬁrms that this residue is suitably positione d to
establish a hydrogen bond with a fundamental and conserved
acid residue (Asp/Glu) that interacts with the pyridinium moi ety
of PLP bound in the enzyme active site. The presence of an
Asn in that position -either native or engineered- enhances t he
enzyme thermal stability under PLP limiting conditions, an d also
the biocatalyst operational stability by causing a higher aﬃ nity
toward PLP and by minimizing PMP release during the ﬁrst
half of the transamination catalytic cycle. To date, no previ ous
reports have pointed to the role of this asparagine in the PLP
binding of aminotransferases. Yet, targeting that position , we
have achieved an enhancement in PLP aﬃnity comparable to
previous attempts made with other PLP-dependent enzymes
such as lysine decarboxylase, rationally engineered throu gh the
addition of disulﬁde bonds to achieve a 3-fold decrease in th e Kd
for PLP (
Sagong and Kim, 2017 ).
Therefore, the identiﬁcation of this position has opened up
a new pathway for engineering dimeric TAs, for reinforcing
the cofactor interactions to ultimately achieve more robus t
biocatalysts with higher potential for industrial applicatio ns.
However, the role of that Asn in PLP binding is less relevant f or
tetrameric TAs, where the stability of the quaternary struc ture
dominates the cofactor binding and consequently the stabili ty of
the reactive cofactor-enzyme complexes.
