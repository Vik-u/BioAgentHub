ABSTRACT: Biocatalysis is an essential tool for asymmetric
synthesis, significantly enhancing the production of chiral
molecules. As advancements in protein screening and engineering
rapidly evolve, the demand for efficient, rapid chiral analysis
methods has intensified. Addressing this need, we introduce a high-
throughput
19
F NMR-based assay that provides comprehensive
insights into the enantioselectivity, stereopreference, and yields of
biocatalytic reactions. This assay has been successfully applied to
screen imine reductases, showcasing its efficacy in the directed
evolution for synthesizing an intermediate of the anti-Parkinson
drug, rotigotine. Our method offers substantial promise for
propelling forward the fields of biocatalysis and synthetic biology
by accelerating the assessment of stereochemical outcomes in
biocatalytic processes.
■
INTRODUCTION
Biocatalysis has emerged as an essential technique across
diverse fields, including organic synthesis and pharmaceutical
development, valued for its mild reaction conditions, excep-
tional selectivity�encompassing enantio-, chemo-, and
regioselectivity�and its environmental advantages.
1−6
This
approach is particularly effective in asymmetric synthesis of
carbon−carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds. For instance,
terpene cyclases efficiently transform unsaturated terpene
backbones into cyclic terpenoids with impressive stereo-
selectivity.
7
Diels−Alderases facilitate the asymmetric [4 + 2]
cyclizations that form cyclohexane rings prevalent in natural
products.
8−11
Moreover, enzymes like cytochrome P450 and
iron-α-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenases (Fe/αKGs) are
gaining recognition for their ability to introduce oxygen into
unreactive C−H bonds.
12−17
The field of biocatalysis is rapidly
advancing with the integration of directed evolution, which is
further bolstered by the use of machine learning and
automated processes in reaction setup and workup. Innova-
tions in high-throughput screening technologies have dramat-
ically accelerated enzyme screening, offering rapid, efficient
evaluations and shifting away from the traditionally slow pace
of enzyme analysis to enhance screening capacity.
18
Despite
these advances, challenges remain in precise chiral screening,
where dependence on traditional chiral high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis considerably limits
the efficiency of the iterative “design-build-test” loop in
asymmetric biocatalysis.
19−25
To enhance the enantioanalysis of biocatalytic reactions,
various strategies have been employed. A prominent approach
is the use of isotopically labeled pseudoenantiomers or pseudo-
meso-compounds, as demonstrated by Reetz and colleagues.
26
This method measures enantioselectivity by comparing the
ratio of nonlabeled to labeled products, which can be
conveniently determined using techniques such as nuclear
magnetic resonance (NMR), and mass spectrometry (Figure
1A).
26,27
Alternatively, enantioselectivity can be assessed by
comparing reaction rates between enantiopure and racemic
substrates, with monitoring through changes in fluorescence or
heat generation.
28,29
These methods are effective for screening
various kinetic resolutions and desymmetrization reactions
(Figure 1A), although they are generally not suitable for
reactions involving prochiral substrates. Recently, Kroutil and
colleagues have developed an ingenious approach for screening
peroxygenases in C−H oxidations, utilizing the formation of
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) from
the highly enantioselective dehydrogenase-catalyzed oxidation
of the secondary alcohol product. This serves as a probe for the
enantioselectivity of the C−H oxidation (Figure 1B).

Additional sophisticated methods include the use of circular
dichroism (CD), which leverages reversible interactions and
covalent derivatization of target chiral analytes to induce
significant Cotton effects and characteristic CD signals.
31−34
Despite significant advancements, there remains a significant
need for rapid screening methods for amines, which are
indispensable in the synthesis of natural products and in
pharmaceutical development. Addressing this, the develop-
ment of specialized enantioanalysis techniques for imine
reductases and reductive aminases is crucial. In this regard,
we have introduced a novel
19
F NMR-based assay for rapid
screening of biocatalytic reactions producing chiral amines.
With NMR spectrometer equipped with a regular autosampler,
this method could assess enantioselectivity, stereopreference,
and reactivity approximate 1000 samples per day (Figure 1C).
By employing this assay in directed evolution experiments, we
enhanced the enantioselectivity of a reductive amination
reaction to produce an intermediate of the anti-Parkinson
drug from 40% enantiomeric excess (ee) to 99%, illustrating its
potential to refine biocatalytic methods efficiently.
■
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The rapid enantioanalysis of amines from biocatalytic reactions
presents significant challenges. One primary issue is the use of
NADPH or its analogs in imine reduction reactions, which
absorb ultraviolet (UV) light strongly and can interfere with
UV or fluorescence-based detection methods. Such interfer-
ence often leads to inaccurate correlations between the optical
signal and the enantiocomposition. Additionally, the use of cell
lysates instead of purified enzymes in biosynthetic screening
introduces variability due to their undefined composition,
which can cause further interferences. Another major hurdle is
the development of rapid chiral analysis methods that are
effective for both primary and secondary amines. Secondary
amines, in particular, pose a greater challenge due to their
increased steric bulkiness,
35−37
even though they are the
desired products in many biocatalytic imine reduction and
reductive amination reactions and are prevalent in natural
products and critical pharmaceuticals. Moreover, the detection
of chiral substances in biocatalytic systems is complicated by
low concentrations of chiral products and the presence of
substrates, enzymes, and byproducts, which create a complex
matrix obscuring detection. This increases the difficulty of
accurately detecting and quantifying chiral substances.
However, current methods, including fluorescence and CD,
often rely on changes in optical signal intensity and do not
provide discrete signals for each enantiomer, undermining
detection fidelity in complex samples and requiring relatively
controlled conditions. To address these challenges, we propose
the use of a suitable
19
F-labeled probe in conjunction with
19
F
NMR, which could provide a viable solution for rapid chiral
screening in biocatalytic reactions. A probe that reversibly
binds chiral analytes eliminates the need for covalent
derivatization, allowing immediate detection upon mixing
with the target sample (Figure 1C).
38−40
The distinct
advantages of
19
F NMR, including high sensitivity and low
background noise, provide robust anti-interference capabilities,
facilitating rapid detection and quantification of minimal
analyte quantities.
41−43
Establishment of the Enantioanalysis Platform. To
evaluate the viability of our approach, we employed 5-methyl-
3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrole (1) as a model substrate (Figure 2).
Upon reduction, it yields 2-methylpyrrolidine (1a) featuring a
chiral carbon center connected to the nitrogen atom.
Traditional chiral detection of 2-methylpyrrolidine via
chromatography is hindered by its weak UV absorption,
typically necessitating covalent derivatization followed by
chromatographic separation. This process significantly impedes

the efficiency of biocatalytic reaction screenings. For the
enantioanalysis of 2-methylpyrrolidine, we utilized a chiral
19
F-
labeled cyclopalladium probe (Figure 2A, probe-CF
3
)
characterized by its open binding site, which is essential for
accommodating sterically bulky analytes and enhancing the
recognition of complex secondary amines.
44
During detection,
the probe interacts with various amine products and the
substrate 1, producing distinct
19
F NMR signals for each
species (Figures 2A−C and Figures S1,3,6 in SI). The
enantiomeric composition is accurately reflected in the
integrals of these signals. To address the slight variations in
the probe’s binding affinity toward the R and S enantiomers of
1a, we introduced a correction coefficient to adjust for biases
in ee determination arising from differential complexation.
This correction factor is readily calculated from the ratio of the
integrals of
19
F NMR signals obtained from the analysis of
racemic samples (Figure S2 in SI).

demonstrated that this method can precisely evaluate the

enantiocomposition of the target sample, showing an excellent
linear correlation between the measured ee values and the
actual enantiocomposition (Figure 2D). Notably, this
technique typically exhibits a deviation of less than 2%,
39,44
offering significantly greater accuracy compared to other
separation-free enantioanalysis methods. Moreover, the capa-
bility of directly detecting the R and S enantiomers of the
amine product enhances the fidelity of the detection process,
facilitating the easy identification of impurities or byproducts.
This feature is crucial for screening biocatalytic reactions and is
difficult to achieve with alternative methods. Evaluating the
conversion of biocatalytic reactions is crucial for assessing
enzyme performance. While various methods exist to
determine the yield of biocatalytic transformations, the
simultaneous determination of both yield and enantioselectiv-
ity is particularly valuable, as it provides comprehensive
information and prevents the oversight of crucial details that
might occur if either efficiency or selectivity is screened in
isolation. Accurate yield determination using chiral dynamic
19
F NMR probes has long been challenging, as incomplete
binding between the probe and the analyte can lead to
significant errors when relying on direct integration of the
19
F
NMR signals. To address this limitation and facilitate the
quantification of conversion, (R)-2-methylpiperidine (Int-I)
was introduced as an internal standard (Figure 2C and Figure
S3 in SI). This compound competes with the target product
for the binding site of probe-CF
3
. By comparing the relative
integrals of the
19
F signals of the internal standard to those of
the product enantiomers, both conversion and enantioselec-
tivity can be simultaneously determined (Figures 2D, 2E and
Figures S1 to S5 in SI). This method enhances the accuracy
and comprehensiveness of our enzyme screening process,
allowing for a more effective evaluation of biocatalytic
reactions.
Screening of Imine Reductases. Having established
methods to determine both conversion and enantioselectivity,
we next applied this approach to the high-throughput
screening of imine reductases for the reduction of specific
substrates. Initially, we employed 12 of well-characterized
enzymes
45−56
as query sequences to conduct the basic local
alignment search tool (BLAST) search against the non-
redundant protein database hosted by the national center for
biotechnology information (NCBI). Based on sequence
similarity, we compiled a panel of 134 imine reductases
(IREDs) (Table S11 in SI). These IREDs were then
systematically tested to identify those that exhibited the
desired catalytic activity and enantioselectivity. Following the
enzymatic reactions (carried out in 96-well plates), the reaction
mixture was combined with a deuterated chloroform solution
containing probe-CF
3
and an internal standard (Int-I). After
thorough mixing and centrifugation, the deuterated chloroform
phase was directly subjected to
19
F NMR analysis without
further purification (Figure 3A). This process allows for the
simultaneous evaluation of both yield and enantioselectivity
based on the newly generated
19
F NMR signals (Figure 2).
Due to the high sensitivity of this method, only 6 μmol of
substrate is required for the analysis, aligning well with
standard biocatalytic screening setups. The platform is highly

19

efficient, taking less than 1.5 min to determine both conversion
and enantioselectivity for each reaction (Table S6 in SI). With
an NMR spectrometer equipped with a standard autosampler,
24 samples can be analyzed in 35 min, requiring no further
optimization of the spectroscopy or acceleration of the
autosampling process. This setup allows for the screening of
approximately 1,000 samples in a single day. Chromatographic
resolution of chiral analytes typically takes 10 to 40 min per
sample and often necessitates covalent derivatization for amine
analysis (Figure S20). Our approach boosts analytical
efficiency by at least 10 to 20 times, offering substantial
potential to advance biosynthetic techniques. During the
screening process, our platform swiftly identified that out of
134 IREDs, 79 demonstrated activity in reducing the substrate
1 to 1a, exhibiting moderate to high activity levels (Figure 3C
and Table S1 in SI). These enzymes showed considerable
stereoselectivity, with the majority favoring the production of
(R)-2-methylpyrrolidine. Notably, only three enzymes�
IRED-186, IRED-191, and IRED-192�exhibited S-stereo-
selectivity (Figure 3B and Table S1 in SI). Among these,
IRED-191 was particularly notable for its high S-selectivity,
achieving an ee of 90% (S) (Table S1 in SI). To elucidate the
molecular basis of stereoselectivity in imine reduction, we
conducted a multiple sequence alignment of IREDs with R-
selectivity and those with S-selectivity obtained through
screening (Figure S18 in SI), and performed homology
modeling on IRED-191. We then compared the simulated
structure of IRED-191 with the known structures of R-selective
IREDs (Figure S19 in SI).
47,51,55
Our analysis revealed
significant divergence at the catalytic residue. Aspartic acid
(Asp) is consistently conserved in the active sites of R-selective
IREDs. In contrast, the equivalent position in S-selective
enzymes is predominantly occupied by either tyrosine (Tyr) or
asparagine (Asn). This variation suggests a pivotal role in
controlling enantioselectivity. This correlation between the
identity of the catalytic residue and the enzyme’s stereo-
selectivity underscores the significance of this position in
defining both the catalytic mechanism and the stereochemical
outcome. We further validated these findings using chiral
HPLC. The ee values of 2-methylpyrrolidine 1a produced by

IRED-181, IRED-185, and IRED-188, determined via chiral
HPLC (which required derivatization and a 40 min chromato-
graphic separation), were consistent with those measured by
our
19
F NMR platform. The deviation between the two
methods was less than 1% (Figure S20−S24 and Table S5 in
the SI), demonstrating the accuracy and reliability of our
19
F
NMR approach. Notably, our method is fully compatible with
whole-cell-based enzymatic assays, as demonstrated by experi-
ments showing that the ee values of products generated by
IRED-191-expressing whole cells and corresponding cell
lysates differed by less than 1% (Table S7 in SI). This
analytical platform is not limited to analyzing 2-methylpyrro-
lidine 1a; it can easily be adapted for the detection of other
amines and N-heterocycles (Figures S12 − S17 and Table S4
in SI). For instance, when screening 1-methyl-3,4-dihydroiso-
quinoline, we identified 109 IREDs capable of facilitating its
reductive transformation, which suggests a broader enzyme
applicability for this substrate compared to substrate 1a. Most
enzymes still preferred R-selectivity, but nine enzymes (IRED-
33, IRED-42, IRED-44, IRED-45, IRED-181, IRED-182,
IRED-186, IRED-191, and IRED-192) exhibited S-selectivity.
Remarkably, all S-selective enzymes except IRED-186 dis-
played excellent S-selectivity, with ee values exceeding 99%
(Table S4 in SI). The findings underscore the versatility and
efficiency of our NMR-based platform in rapidly screening a
wide array of biocatalysts for both activity and selectivity across
different substrates, highlighting its utility in accelerating the
development of efficient, selective biocatalysts.
Directed Evolution of Imine Reductases. After
establishing our screening platform and validating its perform-
ance across various template substrates, we next sought to
demonstrate its broader application by conducting directed
evolution targeting high-value compounds, including pharma-
ceutical intermediates (Figure 4A). Imine reductases are
powerful biocatalysts for the asymmetric synthesis of optically
pure amines, and recent advances have further underscored
their strong potential for industrial application.
48,57−59
To
showcase the utility of our platform, we selected a key
precursor to the anti-Parkinson drug rotigotine as a model
target. The ability of wild-type enzymes to produce this
intermediate with high enantioselectivity was previously
demonstrated by Turner and co-workers in 2021.
60
Given
the increasing importance of directed evolution and the
necessity to screen large libraries of variants efficiently, this
case study serves to validate the effectiveness of our
19
F NMR-
based screening platform and provides a route for accessing
highly selective enzymes. The chiral amine component of
rotigotine is in the S-configuration, prompting us to screen our
IRED panel for this specific reaction (Figure 4B). It is
noteworthy that propylamine, when used in excess, may
compete with product 2a for the binding site on probe-CF
3
.
Consequently, the residual propylamine was removed under
reduced pressure after the reaction to minimize interference. In
our investigation, IRED-105, IRED-99, and IRED-195 all
exhibited substantial activity; however, only IRED-195 showed
the desired S-selectivity. It achieved a high yield coupled with
moderate enantioselectivity of 40% ee (Table S2 in SI). These
results are consistent with those reported in previous studies.
61
We then initiated directed evolution on IRED-195 by docking
the imine intermediate into the enzyme’s active site (Figure
4C). Docking studies identified nine amino acids within 4 Å of
the substrate that potentially interact directly with it: T101,
I129, L180, M183, Y184, W214, F240, G248, and F249. We
applied saturation mutagenesis to these residues and
conducted high-throughput screening using our established
NMR platform to assess both activity and stereoselectivity.
From screening 171 mutants, the variants G248T and G248Y
demonstrated significant improvements in enantioselectivity,
increasing from 40% (S) in the wild type to 90% (S), while
maintaining the original activity levels (Figure 4D and Table
S3 in SI). Mutating I129 to a more rigid proline notably
enhanced S-selectivity. In contrast, substituting it with bulkier
amino acids such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, or
even smaller cysteine resulted in decreased S-selectivity (Figure
4D). The residue G248 proved critical for enhancing S-
selectivity, with mutations to bulkier amino acids consistently
leading to significant improvements. The enhancement in
selectivity by mutations at G248 was not previously reported,
likely because past analytical strategies did not simultaneously
screen for conversion and enantioselectivity. To further
improve the enantioselectivity of the enzyme, we conducted
additional rounds of screening using iterative saturation
mutagenesis (ISM).
62,63
Following iterative optimization, the
final mutant, IRED-195-R2, was able to synthesize the target
intermediate with 99% ee (S) and 72% yield on a 2.5 mmol
scale (Table S9 in the SI). Collectively, our approach enables
us to elucidate the relationship between enzyme activity,
selectivity, and individual residues with greater precision. The
robust enhancement in selectivity underscores the efficacy of
our high-throughput screening platform for directed evolution.
■
CONCLUSIONS
In summary, we have developed a novel
19
F NMR-based high-
throughput platform for screening imine reductases. This
approach outperforms traditional chiral chromatographic
analysis, achieving a more than 10-fold improvement in time
efficiency for enantioanalysis. It allows for the simultaneous
determination of yields and enantioselectivity, providing a
more comprehensive data set compared to methods that only
measure conversion or enantioselectivity. Capable of screening
over 1,000 biosynthetic reactions, this platform is well-suited
for use in directed evolution processes. Previous directed
evolution workflows typically prioritize initial screening for
catalytic activity, with enantioselectivity assessed only in
subsequent stages. In contrast, by simultaneously monitoring
both conversion and enantioselectivity, our method not only
identifies variants with improved activity and selectivity but
also captures mutants that exhibit enhanced stereocontrol
despite reduced activity. This integrated approach enables a
more nuanced and comprehensive strategy for biocatalyst
engineering, where even ″suboptimal″ variants provide
valuable mechanistic insights that can inform the rational
design of enzymes balancing both activity and stereochemical
precision. Moreover, its application extends beyond imine
reductases to include other enzymatic reactions, such as those
involving chiral alcohols, nitriles, and sulfoxides, contingent
upon the use of a
19
F-labeled probe with appropriate
recognition properties. The ability to generate distinct
19
F
NMR signals for each enantiomer ensures excellent compat-
ibility with complex matrices. This capability paves the way for
the screening of more intricate biological processes and
establishes the platform as a robust tool for advancing enzyme
engineering and biocatalysis research.
