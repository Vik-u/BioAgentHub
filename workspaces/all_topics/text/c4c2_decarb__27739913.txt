ABSTRACT
Skunk cabbage (Symplocarpus renifolius) blooms in early spring and its inﬂorescence, referred to as the
spadix, can produce enough heat to melt snow. Here, we investigated glycolytic carbonﬂow at the PEP
branch-point in thermogenic spadices. Our analyses revealed that petals and pistils in thermogenicﬂorets
exhibited higher expression ofSrPEPC and SrAOX transcripts than those ofSrPK, SrPEPCK, and SrPEPtase.
Moreover, enzymatic analyses showed high activities of PEPC in the extracts from thermogenicﬂorets.
Finally, mitochondria from thermogenicﬂorets showed low respiratory activities when pyruvate was used
as a substrate, although a signiﬁcant malate-mediated cyanide-insensitive respiration was observed.
Collectively, these results suggest that PEP metabolism, primarily catabolized by PEPC, plays a critical role
in thermogenesis inS. renifolius.

Introduction
Glycolysis is a central pathway of carbohydrate metabolism
among living organisms from bacteria to plants and
humans.
1,2,3 In the glycolytic pathway, phosphoenolpyruvate
(PEP) is an important intermediate, as it occupies the highest
position on the thermodynamic scale of known phosphorylated
metabolites.
4 In animal cells, PEP is predominantly catalyzed
by pyruvate kinase (PK; EC 2.7.1.40) with the concomitant
phosphorylation of ADP to ATP.
3 However, in addition to PK,
PEP carboxylase (PEPC; EC 4.1.1.31) and PEP phosphatase
(PEPtase; EC 3.1.3.60) play roles in the catabolism of PEP and
overall regulation of mitochondrial respiration in plant cells.
2,5
In contrast, PEP carboxykinase (PEPCK; EC 4.1.1.49) is an
enzyme involved in gluconeogenesis.
3
Although thermogenesis is uncommon in plants, the glyco-
lytic pathway is important in thermogenic plants such as skunk
cabbage (Symplocarpus renifolius), which utilize carbohydrates
as a major respiratory substrate for their metabolic heat-
production.
6 In the case ofS. renifolius, organ-speciﬁc thermo-
genesis occurs in the inﬂorescence known as the spadix, and
maintains a temperature of approximately 23/C14C duringﬂower-
ing, even when ambient temperatures drop below freezing.7,8,9
Because the mitochondrial cyanide-insensitive alternative oxi-
dase (AOX) allows for a dramatic decrease in free energy
between ubiquinol and oxygen,
10,11 SrAOX identiﬁed inS. reni-
folius is likely to play a role in thermogenesis in this plant.7,12,13
In our previous study, sustained thermogenesis in spadices was
associated with the import of carbohydrates including sucrose,
glucose, and fructose from roots.14 Although these results sug-
gest that glycolysis and subsequent AOX-mediated mitochon-
drial respiration plays a crucial role in organ-speci ﬁc
thermogenesis inS. renifolius, the mechanisms of carbohydrate
metabolism in this plant remain poorly understood.
The purpose of the present study was to investigate glycolytic
carbon ﬂow at the PEP branch-point in thermogenic spadices of
S. renifolius. Our data showed that co-expression ofPEPC and
AOX is central for metabolic heat-production in this plant.

RNAs from the spathe, leaf,ﬂoret, and pith tissues collected
from S. renifoliusplants during thermogenesis (Fig. 1). In these
experiments, temperatures of ambient air and thermogenic spa-
dix were 12.2
/C14C and 22.3/C14C, respectively. Our previous study
showed thatﬂorets are thermogenic, while the spathe, leaf, and
pith are non-thermogenic.7 Thermogenic ﬂorets contain the
stamen, pistil, and petal (Fig. 1a). SrAOX mRNA expression
was used as a thermogenic tissue-speciﬁc control to reﬂect
the thermogenic status of the samples. Our data clearly showed
that expression levels of the SrPEPC and SrAOX transcripts
were signiﬁcantly higher in ﬂorets than those in the non-
thermogenic spathe, leaf, and pith tissues (Fig. 1b). In contrast,
the expression levels ofSrPK, SrPEPtase, and SrPEPCK were
nearly undetectable in the spathe, leaf,ﬂoret, and pith tissues
(Fig. 1b).
Next, to examine gene expression in more detail, we focused
on 3 tissues, the petal, stamen, and pistil, each of which com-
prises the ﬂorets of the spadix (Fig. 1a). SrPEPC transcripts
were again co-expressed withSrAOX transcripts in petals and
pistils, whereasSrPK, SrPEPtase, andSrPEPCK transcripts were
expressed at low levels in all tissues examined (Fig. 1c). Expres-
sion levels ofSrPK, SrPEPtase, SrPEPC, SrPEPCK, and SrAOX
were also determined at 2 thermogenic stages of plants col-
lected on the same day, and showed considerably higher
expression ofSrPEPC and SrAOX transcripts in theﬂoret, petal,
and pistil tissues (Figs. S1 and S2).
Enzyme assays for PK, PEPtase, PEPC, and PEPCK
To determine whether similar high enzymatic activities of
PEPC are found in thermogenicﬂorets, we determined the PK,
PEPtase, PEPC, and PEPCK activities in cytosolic fractions
from thermogenicﬂorets. These analyses showed that the spe-
ciﬁc activity of PEPC was signiﬁcantly higher than that of PK,
PEPtase, and PEPCK (Table 1). Another independent prepara-
tion from different thermogenic plants also showed similar
results (Supplementary Table 1).
Predicted amino acid sequence of SrPEPC
Phylogenetic analysis of PEPC amino acid sequences from 15
plants, 3 algae, and 4 bacteria clearly characterized SrPEPC as a
C3-plant-type PEPC (Fig. 2a). Moreover, amino acid sequences
of SrPEPC and the homolog NnPEPC from the thermogenic
plant species Nelumbo nucifera
15 were closely related on the
phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2a).
Multiple sequence alignments of the deduced PEPC amino
acid sequence with other protein sequences from C3- and C4-
plant PEPCs showed that SrPEPC possesses conserved alanine
and arginine residues, characteristic of C3-plant-type PEPCs
16
(Fig. 2b). Moreover, a serine residue with a potential phosphor-
ylation site5 was highly conserved across C3- and C4-types of
plant PEPCs, including that fromS. renifolius.

Substrate-dependent oxygen uptake
The present results indicate that pyruvate, which is formed
from PEP by PK and/or PEPtase, is not a major end-product of
the glycolytic pathway in thermogenic cells of S. renifolius.
Thus, we next wished to clarify whether puriﬁed mitochondria
from thermogenic ﬂorets oxidize pyruvate as a substrate for
respiration. In this analysis, we used the same experimental
conditions at pH 7.2 as previously reported for pyruvate-
mediated respiration in the mitochondria from thermogenic
appendices of Arum maculatum
17 (Fig. 3a and b). In these
experiments, we used the cinnamate derivative UK5099 to
inhibit mitochondrial pyruvate transport
17,18 and determined
the effects on respiratory rates (Fig. 3b). Our results showed
that pyruvate does not act as a substrate for mitochondrial
respiration and that UK5099 does not affect respiration. How-
ever, subsequent addition of NADH led to signi ﬁcantly
increased respiration rates both in absence and in presence of
cyanide, indicating cyanide-insensitive mitochondrial AOX
activities (Fig. 3a and b).
To conﬁrm that our puriﬁed mitochondria from thermo-
genic ﬂorets do not utilize externally added pyruvate as a sub-
strate for respiration, we performed experiments at pH 6.8, 7.2,
and 7.6 in presence of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex
cofactors NAD
C and thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP).19 These
experiments indicated that pyruvate was not used as a

respiratory substrate (Fig. 3c– e). However, addition of exoge-
nous malate led to increased respiration rates regardless of
whether cyanide was present, with the highest respiration rate
observed at pH 7.2 (Fig. 3c– e).
Discussion
PEP is an energy-rich compound and its metabolism in replace-
ment of phosphate group plays an important role in glycoly-
sis.
4,5 Therefore, analysis of the metabolic partitioning of PEP
will provide insight into the glycolytic end products and energy
substrates used in subsequentmitochondrial respiration.
Herein, we showed that transcripts encoding the C3-type of
PEPC protein SrPEPC were speciﬁcally and highly co-expressed
with those encoding SrAOX in the petals and pistils of thermo-
genic ﬂorets, whereas the expression levels ofSrPK, SrPEPtase,
and SrPEPCK transcripts were extremely low in all tissues exam-
ined (Fig. 1). Moreover, enzymatic activities of PEPC in thermo-
genic ﬂorets were higher than those of PK, PEPtase, and PEPCK
(Table 1), indicating that PEP is predominantly catabolized by
PEPC in thermogenic tissues ofS. renifolius.A l t h o u g he x t r e m e l y

high enzymatic activities of PEPC have been reported in other
thermogenic plants includingA. maculatum,20 this is the ﬁrst
study to show tissue-speciﬁc co-expression ofPEPC and AOX in
quantitative gene expression analyses of thermogenic plants.
Because the AOX-mediated energy-dissipative respiration
pathway contributes signiﬁcantly to cellular thermogenesis in
plants, co-expression of SrAOX and SrPEPC detected in the
present study may be critical for metabolic cross-talk between
the cytosol and AOX-expressing mitochondria in thermogenic
cells (Fig. 4). In thermogenic cells, PEP was primarily catabo-
lized by PEPC to produce oxaloacetic acid, which is used
directly as a mitochondrial respiration substrate or is converted
to malate by malate dehydrogenase
21,22 for use as a respiratory
substrate (Fig. 3c– e). In either case, such PEPC-mediated
metabolism may contribute signiﬁcantly to continuous carbon
ﬂow in furnishing C4-dicarboxylic acids that maintains
increased respiration for thermogenesis inS. renifolius. These
data are consistent with those of previous report of constitutive
PEPC-overexpressing transgenic plants, in which carbonﬂow
was redirected from soluble sugars to organic acids.
23 More
importantly, because PEPC catalyzes the addition of HCO3
¡ to
PEP,4 excess CO2 that is liberated with increased mitochondrial
respiration in thermogenic cells may be catabolized by complex
I-integrated mitochondrial g-carbonic anhydrases to form
HCO
3
¡,24,25 which is subsequently converted to oxaloacetic
acid by PEPC. Previously, it was shown that PEPC is highly
expressed and participates in the recycling of respired CO
2 in
the spikelets of C3-type plants.26 Similarly, fruiting plants pos-
sess a system known as fruit photosynthesis,27 in which CO2
from mitochondrial respiration is reﬁxed by PEPC. These data
indicate that thermogenic plants express higher levels of PEPC
and AOX enzymes in their non-photosynthetic organs, such as
in the spadices of S. renifolius which developed specialized
metabolisms not only for recycling of excess CO
2 similar to
that seen in other C3 plants but also for energy-dissipating
AOX-mediated mitochondrial respiration during evolution.
Accordingly, integration of PEPC-mediated CO
2 assimilation
and AOX-mediated mitochondrial respiration probably act as
substantial carbon resources in thermogenic plants.
In the present study, mitochondria puriﬁed from thermo-
genic ﬂorets ofS. renifoliusdid not oxidize exogenous pyruvate
as a respiratory substrate in the presence or absence of cofac-
tors (Fig. 3). In contrast, mitochondria from thermogenic spa-
dices of A. maculatum were previously shown to oxidize
exogenous pyruvate in the absence of exogenous cofactors.
18 In
addition, rapid oxidation of pyruvate by isolatedA. maculatum
mitochondria was sensitive to UK5099, suggesting the presence
of mitochondrial pyruvate carriers, as shown recently in
Arabidopsis.
28 Hence, expression of mitochondrial pyruvate
carriers in thermogenic ﬂorets of S. renifolius may be lower
than in those of A. maculatum. Because pyruvate has been
identiﬁed as an allosteric activator ofS. renifoliusAOX,12 AOX
activities in this plant may be post-translationally regulated by
intra-mitochondrially produced pyruvate via malic enzyme29,30
that uses malate from the PEPC-mediated metabolic pathway.
It should be noted here that NAD-dependent malic enzyme
a- and/or b-subunits have been identiﬁed in mitochondria
from thermogenicﬂorets ofS. renifolius.
13
In conclusion, we report that SrPEPC is abundantly co-
expressed with SrAOX in thermogenic ﬂorets of S. renifolius.
These results further suggest that PEPC plays a role in
metabolic heat-production in furnishing C4-dicarboxylic acids
to AOX-expressing mitochondria in other thermogenic plants.
Materials and methods
Plant materials
All plant materials were sampled from wildS. renifoliusgrown
outdoors. For thermal imaging, S. renifolius plants that were
transplanted from Hakuba (Nagano prefecture, Japan) to Iwate
University campus (Iwate prefecture, Japan) in April 2005 were
used. For preparation of total RNAs, fresh spathe, leaf,ﬂoret
and pith were collected fromS. renifolius at Fujine (Iwate pre-
fecture, Japan) on April 3, 2012 and at Omori (Akita prefecture,
Japan) on April 1, 2014. Mitochondria were puriﬁed from spa-
dices ofS. renifoliussampled at Omori on March 27, 2015. For
enzyme assays,ﬂorets were collected from thermogenic spadices
of S. renifoliusthat were sampled at Omori on April 20, 2016.
Figure 4. PEP-mediated metabolism in thermogenic cells of S. renifolius . PEP
yielded by glycolytic pathway is predominantly catabolized by PEPC to produce
oxaloacetic acid (OAA). OAA is either directly oxidized in the mitochondria or con-
verted to malate (Mal) by cytosolic malate dehydrogenase (MDH). Malate is catab-
olized by the malic enzyme (ME) in mitochondria to produce pyruvate (Pyr) and
carbon dioxide (CO
2). Intra-mitochondrially produced pyruvate can either enter
the TCA cycle or allosterically activate the alternative oxidase (AOX). The CO2 pro-
duced in the TCA cycle and by the malic enzyme is catabolized by complex I-
integrated mitochondrial carbonic anhydrase to form bicarbonate (HCO3
¡) and is
catabolized by PEPC to yield OAA. Expression of PEPC and AOX can enhance the
recycling of respired CO
2 and energy dissipative mitochondrial respiration. Major
metabolic pathways predicted in the present study are depicted by red arrows.

Thermal imaging and temperature measurements
Thermal images were obtained using an infrared thermal cam-
era as described previously.7 Temperatures of the spadices were
measured using an automatic recording thermometer (TR-52;
T & D, Nagano, Japan).
Total RNA extraction, cDNA ampliﬁcation, and isolation of
full-length cDNAs encoding SrPK, SrPEPtase, SrPEPC, and
SrPEPCK
Total RNAs were extracted using either an RNeasy Plant Mini
Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) or a FastPure
/C210RNA Kit
(Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). First-strand cDNA synthesis was
performed using PrimeScript
TM II 1st strand cDNA Synthesis
Kit (Takara Bio) with oligo-dT primers provided by the manu-
facturer. Procedures for cDNA cloning are described in the
Supplementary information. Brieﬂy, partial fragments of tar-
geted genes forSrPK, SrPEPtase, SrPEPC, and SrPEPCK were
ﬁrst ampliﬁed using PCR withTakara Ex Taq
/C210(Takara Bio)
and the primers are listed in Supplementary Table 2. Gene-spe-
ciﬁc primers were then designed to perform 5
0- and 30-rapid
ampliﬁcation of cDNA ends using SMARTerTMRACE cDNA
Ampliﬁcation Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA). To
isolate full-length cDNAs, ﬁnal PCR ampli ﬁcations were
performed with the KOD -Plus- (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) with
the primers shown in Supplementary Table 2. The obtained
fragments were cloned into the T-Vector (pMD19, Takara Bio)
and sequenced in both directions. Full-length sequences
were determined by isolating at least 2 independent clones
with identical sequences. DNA sequences were analyzed using
GENETYX software (Genetyx, Tokyo, Japan). Complete
cDNAs encodingSrPEPC, SrPK, SrPEPCK, andSrPEPtase were
deposited in the DNA Data Bank of Japan with Accession num-
bers LC155943, LC155944, LC155945, and LC155946,
respectively.
Expression analyses of genes encoding SrPK, SrPEPtase,
SrPEPC, and SrPEPCK
Real-time qPCR was performed using a Thermal Cycler Dice
(TP800; Takara Bio) instrument as described previously.
13,31
Gene-speciﬁc primers (Supplementary Table 2) were designed
from identiﬁed cDNAs and the housekeeping geneEF1a was
used as a normalization control.31
Phylogenetic tree analyses of PEPC proteins and sequence
alignments
A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining
method with ClustalW
32 for 22 PEPC proteins gathered from
GeneBank/C210. A bootstrap consensus tree was inferred from
1000 replicates to represent the evolutionary history of the
present taxa. Branches corresponding to partitions that were
reproduced in less than 50% of bootstrap replicates were col-
lapsed. Multiple sequence alignments were performed using
GENETYX software.
Enzyme assays
Enzyme activities of PK, PEPtase, PEPC, and PEPCK were
determined in thermogenic ﬂorets after extraction in ice-cold
extraction buffer containing 0.3 M mannitol, 20 mM MOPS
(pH 7.5), 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM pyruvate, 7 mM cysteine, and
0.2% BSA. Extracts wereﬁltered through 8 layers of Miracloth
(EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Filtrates were collected
in 50-mL tubes and centrifuged at 120 g for 10 min at 4
/C14C.
Supernatants were collected and centrifuged again at 12,000 g
for 10 min at 4
/C14C, and stored at¡80/C14C until enzymatic analy-
ses. Enzyme assays of PK and PEPtase and assays of PEPC and
PEPCK for decarboxylation were conducted as previously
described33,34,35 with a double beam spectrophotometer (Bio-
spec-1600, Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) at 25/C14C.
Isolation of intact mitochondria and respiration analyses
Mitochondria were isolated from S. renifolius spadices as
described previously.36 Oxygen uptake by mitochondria was
then measured according to our previous reports31,36 at 25/C14C.
Determination of protein concentrations
Protein concentrations of isolated mitochondria and crude
extracts were determined as described previously.15
Statistical analysis
All data were compared using one-way factorial ANOVA
(SigmaPlot 12, Systat Software, San Jose, CA, USA). Tukey’s
honest signiﬁcance posthoc tests were used to identify signiﬁ-
cantly different means. Signiﬁcant differences between means
were calculated atP D 0.05.
