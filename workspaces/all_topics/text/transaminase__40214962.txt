Abstract
Background and Objective The purpose of this study is to investigate the status of blood concentration of sirolimus (SRL), 
explore the factors influencing SRL drug blood concentration, and provide guidance for the appropriate utilization of clini-
cal medications.
Methods A single-center retrospective cohort study encompassed 1535 blood drug concentration observations obtained from 
249 children from August 2018 to June 2023. Participants were categorized into four groups (A, B, C, and D) on the basis 
of their blood concentration levels at various time intervals. The analysis focused on identifying the factors that influenced 
blood concentration in the short- and long-term posttreatment. The primary endpoint was factors affecting the sirolimus 
blood concentration. The effect of physiopathological indicators on the corrected blood drug concentration (C/D value) was 
analyzed to avoid the effect of differences in the dose of SRL used in patients on SRL blood concentrations. The multiple 
linear regression model was used to examine the impact of factors influencing pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics 
on the C/D.
Results Analysis of SRL blood concentration monitoring indicated that a majority (60.43%) of patients demonstrated a 
trough sirolimus concentration (C0) below the level of the recommended threshold of 5 ng/mL, while approximately 17.7% 
of patients exceeded 15 ng/mL. The results indicated a noteworthy association between weight and body surface area (BSA) 
and the C/D of SRL in groups A, B, and D (P < 0.05). Additionally, aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), and albumin (ALB) in group A; ALB in group B; and platelet count (PLT) in group C demonstrated a statistically 
significant correlation with the C/D of SRL (P < 0.05).
Conclusions Clinicians should optimize medication plans by considering the child’s weight, BSA, ALT, AST, PLT, ALB, 
and relevant factors. These findings may serve as a valuable resource for clinicians.
Key Points 
Through correlation analysis, we suggest that the adjust-
ment of sirolimus (SRL) blood concentration should be 
made in consideration of the child's physiological and 
biochemical parameters.
Pharmacogenomic factors and interactions with concom-
itant medications have a substantial impact on sirolimus 
blood concentration profiles, underscoring the necessity 
for well-designed prospective cohort studies in this field.

1 Introduction
Sirolimus (SRL), also known as rapamycin, is a highly 
effective immunosuppressant that operates by inhibit -
ing crucial molecules in the phosphatidylinositol-3-ki-
nase–protein kinase B–rapamycin mammalian target 
(PI3K–AKT–mTOR) pathway [1 , 2]. Using SRL in pedi-
atric patients with organ transplantation, autoimmune 
disease, vascular malformation, and tuberous sclerosis 
has shown a steady increase as a result of advancements 
in clinical trials and real-world evidence. This strategy 
has become a crucial element in improving prognosis and 
has made a significant contribution to improving survival 
rates in children [3 –6]. The narrow therapeutic window of 
SRL results in notable variability in individual responses 
among pediatric patients, particularly in younger age 
cohorts in the process of growth and development who 
80 X. Xu et al.
demonstrate heightened instability in pharmacokinetic 
parameters. Insufficient research findings on blood drug 
levels present difficulties in accurately establishing appro-
priate dosages for patients using this measure [7 ].
The reference range can assist healthcare providers in 
modifying medication dosages according to individual risk 
factors to attain or sustain a desired concentration within 
the reference range, thereby minimizing disease activity and 
mitigating potential adverse effects. Longitudinal data are 
necessary to establish the efficacy of maintaining a specific 
concentration in preventing patient flares over an extended 
period of time. Additionally, we investigated the physiologi-
cal determinants influencing the probability of attaining a 
target blood level of SRL. Previous studies on the factors 
influencing the blood concentration of SRL have been lim-
ited by small sample sizes of approximately 52 patients and 
a lack of multivariate analysis, with only univariate analyses 
conducted [8]. Consequently, the factors affecting the blood 
concentration of SRL have not been thoroughly elucidated.
The aim of this research was to investigate the blood con-
centration levels of SRL at different timepoints and to assess 
the factors that impact these concentrations through multiple 
linear regression analysis. The overarching objective was to 
offer recommendations for appropriate clinical use, tailor 
dosages for individual patients, reduce the occurrence of 
adverse drug reactions, and improve treatment outcomes.
2  Materials and Methods
2.1  Study Design and Inclusion Criteria
The study received approval from the research ethics com-
mittee of the hospital (reference number: [2024]-Y-094-D). 
It retrospectively enrolled pediatric patients who under -
went a minimum of 1 week of treatment with SRL at the 
center between August 2018 and June 2023. A cohort of 249 
patients who underwent a total of 1535 tests were monitored 
from the day preceding the initiation of SRL treatment until 
the conclusion of the treatment regimen. The relevant data 
are outlined in Table 1. The study’s inclusion criteria encom-
passed patients diagnosed with immune deficiency, immune 
thrombocytopenia, and lymphatic malformation, who were 
required to provide detailed records of their medical history, 
medication regimen, and laboratory test results. In addition, 
individuals with abnormal SRL blood trough concentrations 
were required to undergo genetic testing. If genetic variants 
were present, they were excluded from this study. Addition-
ally, participants were required to have undergone treatment 
with SRL for a minimum of 1 week, with their blood drug 
concentration reaching a steady state. The study’s exclusion 
criteria excluded patients with diarrhea (watery stools 6–8 
times/day), those who had received SRL treatment for less 
than 1 week, and those who lacked complete relevant infor-
mation. The collected case data were categorized for analysis 
of influencing factors on the basis of blood concentration 
monitoring time: 1 week after SRL (group A), 2 weeks after 
SRL (group B), 4 weeks after SRL (group C), and 12 weeks 
after SRL (group D). All patients were orally administered 
SRL capsules (0.5 mg, North China Pharmaceutical) for 
treatment, accompanied by concurrent medication education. 
The recommended individualized starting doses ranged from 
0.8 to 1.0 mg/m2/day.
2.2  Outcome Measures
The blood concentration of SRL data were acquired from 
the hospital system, along with documentation of patient 
demographics, daily dosage, and diverse pathophysiological 
parameters, including erythrocyte count (RBC), leukocyte 
count (WBC), platelet count (PLT), hemoglobin (HGB), 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT), total bilirubin (TBIL), albumin (ALB), and creati-
nine (CREA).
2.3  Sample Analysis
Blood samples were obtained and processed utilizing a 
Siemens Automatic Biochemistry Analyzer Viva-E (EMIT 
2000 homogeneous enzyme immunoassay). The samples 
were expeditiously cooled on an ice plate or ice box and 
promptly transported to the designated sample processing 
area within 30 min for DNA extraction or centrifugation. 
Following this, the blood sample underwent processing and 
was subsequently divided into two duplicate samples by the 
sample handler, with one designated as the determination 
sample and the other as the backup sample. Both duplicates 
were then stored in a refrigerator at temperatures of − 20 
°C or − 80 °C [9]. Moreover, SRL blood concentrations and 
physiopathologic indices were completed within 2 h. The 
blood sample collection, handover, processing, and storage 
procedures were rigorously followed according to the guide-
lines outlined in the SRL blood sample collection, hando-
ver, processing, and storage procedures. Dosage adjustments 
were made as needed to maintain levels within the range of 
5–15 ng/mL. The maintenance of SRL blood levels at 5–15 
ng/mL was deemed to represent a state of equilibrium.
2.4  Statistical Analysis
The blood drug concentrations of 249 patients who com-
pleted the observation were analyzed utilizing the quartile 
method. The categorized data that adhered to a normal dis-
tribution were reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD), 
whereas data that did not conform to a normal distribution 
81

were presented as median (range). Pearson’s correlation 
was used for the single-factor analysis of normally dis-
tributed data. Spearman’s correlation was employed when 
the P-value was less than 0.05, indicating statistical sig-
nificance. Significant indicators identified in the univariate 
analysis were subsequently included in a logistic regression 
analysis. The logistic regression analysis confirmed a sta-
tistically significant difference, as indicated by a P -value 
below 0.05.
3  Results
3.1  Patient Population and Characteristics
This study enrolled 249 patients who satisfied the predeter -
mined criteria and were divided into four groups on the basis 
of the timing of blood drug concentration collection. The 
mean ages of the groups were 4.59, 4.93, 4.94, and 5.4 years, 
respectively, with corresponding mean SRL blood concen-
trations of 7.68, 8.12, 7.42, and 6.61 ng/mL. Detailed data 
can be found in Table 1.
3.2  Range of SRL Blood Levels
A total of 1535 measurements of trough sirolimus concen-
tration (C0) were collected, with a median C0 value 6.11 ng/
mL observed in patients at a steady state, ranging from 0.05 
to 29 ng/mL. Figure  1 represents the distribution of the C 0 
concentrations. In 33.6% of the observed tests (515/1,535), 
the mean C0 value was below 5 ng/mL in 278 distinct indi-
viduals (60.43%). Conversely, in 17.5% of the observed tests 
(268/1,535), the mean C0 exceeded 10 ng/mL in 162 distinct 
patients (35.22%). C0 in 68 patients was below 5 ng/mL and 
above 10 ng/mL. A notable proportion of patients (35.7%) 
exhibited at least one C 0 level exceeding 10 ng/mL, while 
17.7% had at least one C0 level at steady state, surpassing 15 
ng/mL. Among patients concurrently receiving azole anti -
fungals, C0 levels ranged from 11 to 29 ng/mL, resulting in 
an overall elevation in C0 levels.
3.3  Correlation Analysis of Influencing Factors
The age, weight, BSA, RBC, WBC, PLT, HGB concen-
tration, liver enzymes, urinary CREA, and SRL corrected 
blood drug concentration (C /D value) of the four groups 
were subjected to single-factor analysis. The findings indi-
cated significant statistical correlations between age, weight,

0.05. WBC and ALB in group A, TBIL and ALB in group 
B, WBC and TBIL in group C, and TBIL in group D also 
showed statistical correlations with the C /D of SRL. How-
ever, RBC and PLT had no significant correlation with the 
C/D of SRL in the four different sampling periods (Table 2). 
Multiple regression analysis indicated a significant associa-
tion between weight and BSA with the C/D of SRL in groups 
A, B, and D. Furthermore, AST, ALT, and ALB in group 
A; ALB in group B; and PLT in group C exhibited a statisti-
cally significant correlation with the C /D of SRL, with all 
P-values < 0.05 (Table 3).
4  Discussion
SRL exhibits a narrow therapeutic range and considerable 
interindividual variability, particularly among pediatric 
patients experiencing growth and development (Fig. 2). Con-
sequently, the empirical adjustment of SRL dosage to cater 
to children’s individualized precision medication require-
ments poses a challenge. In this study, the sample of 249 
pediatric patients were gathered retrospectively, and their 
gender, age, daily drug dosage, and various pathophysiologi-
cal parameters were analyzed. The findings indicated that 
approximately half of the children had blood levels failing to 
meet the desired target or surpassed the established standard 
(5–15 ng/mL). Univariate analysis revealed a statistically 
significant correlation between age, weight, BSA, WBC, 
HGB, AST, ALT, TBIL, ALB, CREA, and blood SRL con-
centrations. The multivariate analysis revealed that the chil-
dren’s weight and BSA, PLT, ALT, AST, and ALB before 
administration were significantly correlated with SRL blood 
concentrations.
The therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) analysis con-
ducted on SRL indicated that a significant proportion 
(60.43%) of the patients in this study had C0 below the mini-
mum recommended threshold of 5 ng/mL once they reached 
a stable state. Conversely, a notable fraction (approximately 
17.7%) of patients experienced excessive drug exposure, 
with concentrations exceeding 15 ng/mL, owing to enhanced 
bioavailability. This can potentially result in treatment fail-
ure, disease recurrence, and the development of drug resist-
ance. Kenecia et al.  discovered that 73–84% of patients 
admitted to the hospital exhibited insufficient exposure to 
medication when their blood concentrations fell below the 
desired range. Additionally, 2–8% of these patients experi-
enced excessive exposure when their blood concentrations 
exceeded the target range [10]. Although our findings are 
consistent with those of prior studies, the percentage of over-
exposure in our study was higher than that of the exposed 
population in previous studies. This may be due to the inclu-
sion of a larger population in our study and a population

of immunodeficient children with many antimicrobial drug 
combinations that may lead to overexposure to SRL.
Based on previous studies, SRL is mainly metabolized 
by cytochrome P450-3A4 isoenzyme (CYP3A4) and, to 
a lesser extent, through cytochrome P450-3A5 isoenzyme 
(CYP3A5) and cytochrome P450-2C8 isoenzyme (CYP2C8) 
[11]. In turn, affecting these hepatic enzymes has an impact 
on SRL metabolism. For example, several CYP3A4 inhibi-
tors, such as triazole antibacterial agents (voriconazole, 
fluconazole, itraconazole, and posaconazole), clotrimazole 
clarithromycin, and erythromycin, nonhydropyradine cal-
cium-channel blockers (such as diltiazem and verapamil), 
amiodarone, protease inhibitors, cimetidine, and grapefruit 
all may increase SRL blood level [11]. However, rifampicin 
has been found to potentially cause a decrease in sirolimus 
blood levels [12]. In addition, on the basis of the feature that 
SRL acts as an inhibitor of the mTOR pathway, SRL is now 
widely used in the treatment of children with primary immu-
nodeficiency. Moreover, children with immunodeficiency 
often have recurrent infections. Therefore, the combination 
of SRL and antimicrobial drugs is important and unavoid-
able. Based on previous studies, renal transplant patients 
treated with SRL and voriconazole experience a 4.5-fold 
increase in the AUC for SRL, while the dose of SRL needs 
to be decreased by 75–87.5% [13, 14]. Coadministration of 
SRL and voriconazole increases the blood concentration of 
SRL [15]. A previous study showed similar results in a case 
of TDM when the azole antifungal itraconazole was com-
bined with SRL. The whole blood trough concentration of 
SRL fell outside the therapeutic range after 4 days of an 
SRL and itraconazole combination [16]. In addition, steroids 
are commonly used clinically as antiinflammatory drugs, 
also metabolized through CYP3A4. So far, current clinical 
evidence regarding drug interactions between steroids and 
sirolimus is conflicting. In some prior studies, prednisolone 
affected the pharmacokinetics of SRL, while in others, it did 
not [17, 18]. Corticosteroids exhibit dual regulatory effects 
on CYP3A activity, functioning as both competitive inhibi-
tors and transcriptional inducers. As endogenous substrates 
of the CYP3A isoenzyme, these agents demonstrate dose-
dependent pharmacokinetic interactions through substrate 
competition mechanisms. Functioning as CYP3A substrates, 
corticosteroids may competitively inhibit the metabolic 
clearance of coadministered drugs mediated by this enzy -
matic pathway. This inhibitory mechanism predominates 
during the initial phase of corticosteroid therapy. Notably, 
a paradoxical induction effect emerges following prolonged 
administration (typically manifesting ≥ 72 h posttreatment 
initiation), mediated through activation of the steroid and 
xenobiotic receptor (SXR) (also called pregane X recep-
tor (PXR)) [19, 20]. This receptor-mediated upregulation 
of CYP3A expression ultimately enhances the hepatic 
metabolism of concomitant CYP3A substrates, potentially 
resulting in clinically significant reductions in systemic 
exposure to therapeutic agents such as sirolimus [21]. In 
healthy subjects, exposure to SRL was elevated by cyclo-
sporine, diltiazem, verapamil, or erythromycin [22]. In addi-
tion, it has been shown that coadministration of letermovir 
with SRL resulted in 3.4-fold increases in area under the 
blood concentration–time curve and 2.8-fold increases in

maximum blood concentration [23]. A recent study reported 
for the first time that cenobamate decreases SRL/everlimus 
blood levels [24]. It is considered that this situation is caused 
by both everolimus/sirolimus and cenobamate being metabo-
lized via CYP3A4.
In addition, genetic polymorphisms in SRL are a factor 
that cannot be ignored. There are numerous types of genes 
that affect SRL metabolism on the basis of our previous daily 
practice. Genotypes ABCB1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5 can all 
influence SRL metabolism or toxicity. Sam et al. found that 
ABCB1 type was associated with an increase in triglycerides 
in renal transplant patients treated with SRL [25]. Mbatchi 
et al. found that ABCB1 gene polymorphisms were also 
associated with shortened SRL half-life [26]. Expression of 
the CYP3A5 enzyme has likewise been shown to result in 
an increase in the required SRL dose [27]. In addition, muta-
tion gene carriers require higher SRL doses compared with 
CYP3A4 wild type [27].
Compared with preceding investigations, our study cor -
roborated the findings of Tejani et al.  and Filler et al., indi-
cating a significant inverse correlation between age, weight, 
and SRL blood concentrations [28, 29]. Moreover, our study 
demonstrated a statistically significant inverse association 
between the age and weight of pediatric patients and SRL 
blood concentrations across all four distinct timepoints of 
blood concentration collection, as determined through uni-
variate analysis. Furthermore, Yimeng et al. conducted a 
study on TDM in pediatric patients and demonstrated a sig-
nificant positive association between AST levels and SRL 
trough concentrations. This finding was also observed by 
Yadi et al. in adult renal transplantation, where alanine ALT 
and AST levels positively correlated with SRL blood con-
centrations [ 30, 31]. The findings from the four groups in 
this study indicate a statistically significant positive correla-
tion between the liver enzymes AST and ALT and the C/D of 
SRL. This finding aligns with previous research, suggesting 
that the liver primarily metabolizes SRL. Moreover, ALT 
and AST, commonly used sensitive indicators of liver func-
tion in clinical treatment, were consistent with the extent 
of hepatocyte damage in most cases. The liver function of 
pediatric patients can directly impact the pharmacokinet -
ics of SRL, consequently influencing its blood concentra-
tion. However, SRL can potentially cause liver damage in 
pediatric patients, with instances of fatal hepatic necrosis 
observed when the trough concentrations in whole blood 
exceeded therapeutic levels. Zhang et al . studied adult 
patients who underwent liver transplantation and demon -
strated that CREA, an index of renal function, was among 
the factors influencing steady-state blood trough concentra-
tion of SRL. In this study, CREA was also correlated with 
the C/D of the SRL [32]. Consequently, variations in renal 
function among children may result in disparities in blood 
drug concentrations.

Analysis of Sirolimus Blood Concentration and Influencing Factors in Pediatric Patients
The multivariate regression analysis results demonstrated 
a statistically significant correlation between the weight and 
BSA of pediatric patients and the C/D of SRL at weeks 2 
and 12 (P < 0.01). These factors were identified as the pri-
mary determinants of blood SRL concentration. This study’s 
blood concentration collection times were during the 1st, 
2nd, 4th, and 12th weeks, covering the initial, intermediate, 
and long-term phases of SRL absorption and metabolism.
Consequently, we can assume that pediatric patients’ 
weight and BSA are the primary influences on SRL blood 
concentrations during the early and middle stages of SRL 
absorption and metabolism. Furthermore, consistent with 
the findings of the univariate analysis, a significant correla-
tion was observed between C /D and liver enzymes ALT, 
AST, and ALB in the 1-week sampling group. This associa-
tion could be attributed to the initial processes of SRL bind-
ing and metabolism in the body. Owing to the short half-life 
of SRL, ALT, and AST in children, observations related to 
metabolic processes correlate with SRL blood concentra-
tions only in short-term observations [33]. In contrast to 
the univariate analysis findings, this study demonstrated that 
PLT is a significant influencing factor, exhibiting a statis-
tically significant correlation with the C /D of SRL in the 
sampled group at week 4. This finding is consistent with a 
previous study by Yadi et al., who investigated blood con-
centration monitoring in adult renal transplantation [ 31]. 
Balduini et al. demonstrated an inverse correlation between 
PLT and age [34]. Consequently, PLT was identified as an 
independent factor for SRL blood concentration in multi-
variate linear analysis. This conclusion was reached after 
excluding the influence of age on both PLT and SRL C /D 
multivariate analysis. However, the specific reasons for this 
result require further research.
In contrast to prior research, this study’s findings indi-
cate a lack of association between RBC and SRL blood con-
centrations. However, a cohort study on SRL in the elderly 
population showed a statistically inverse correlation between 
RBC and SRL blood concentrations [35]. This disparity may 
be due to the different populations examined in the respec-
tive studies. This study was conducted in a pediatric popula-
tion, where the lower number of RBCs compared with adults 
was attributed to a scarcity of hematopoietic raw materials 
resulting from their rapid growth and development. Conse-
quently, no significant impact on the blood SRL concentra-
tion was observed.
We found that the blood concentration of SRL was also 
statistically correlated with HGB and ALB. This result has 
not been previously reported, and the mechanism of its 
occurrence remains unclear. Additionally, this study’s results 
showed that WBC count was positively correlated with the 
C/D of SRL in the first and fourth weeks. This correlation 
may be due to the fact that SRL leads to increased suscep-
tibility to infection and increased WBC. Severe infections 
also inhibit the CYP450 enzyme system, and it has been 
shown that SRL metabolism is linked to the expression of 
CYP450 enzymes [36, 37]. Consequently, infections may 
lead to a reduction in SRL metabolism. Previous popula-
tion pharmacokinetic studies also found that blood levels 
of SRL suddenly increase when patients develop symptoms 
of infection [38]. Further research should be conducted to 
confirm this result.

The univariate analysis in this study revealed that RBC 
and HGB had an opposite relationship with the blood con-
centration of SRL. Additionally, the blood SRL concentra-
tion was not significantly correlated with RBC in this study 
in multivariate analysis. This result differs from previous 
studies because SRL can enter and bind RBCs. Generally, 
HBG is present in RBCs, and the relationship between the 
two is similar to SRL blood concentrations. However, these 
results have not been reported.
This study had several limitations. The administration in 
this study was based on the adult kidney transplant treat-
ment window during the SRL administration. However, 
this treatment window may not have been optimal for the 
study population. Therefore, it is necessary to retrospectively 
investigate the optimal treatment window for SRL in the 
pediatric population. Furthermore, this study was retrospec-
tive. Although the four sampling groups comprised the same 
study population, the lack of certain data resulted in slight 
variations in the composition of each group. Consequently, 
this study’s findings solely focus on the impact of labora -
tory indicators on SRL C/D while disregarding the potential 
influences of combination drugs, genetic factors, and food 
factors on SRL blood concentration. Hence, to obtain more 
precise results, it is imperative to undertake prospective 
studies to corroborate this study’s findings.
5  Conclusions
Drug monitoring in this study revealed that 60.43% of the 
patients had an average C 0 below the minimum recom-
mended threshold of 5 ng/mL after achieving a steady 
state. Additionally, 17.7% of the patients had a C 0 exceed-
ing the maximum threshold of 15 ng/mL. Subsequently, 
the results of univariate and multivariate analyses revealed 
that weight, BSA, PLT, AST, ALT, and ALB, with the 
C/D of SRL, indicated that these factors independently 
influenced the blood concentration of SRL. Dosage adjust-
ment was appropriately implemented with the children’s 
weight, BSA, and PLT, ALT, AST, and ALB parameters. 
In addition, a population pharmacokinetic model of SRL 
was subsequently developed, incorporating independent 
influencing factors derived from multivariate linear regres-
sion analysis as covariates in the model. This approach 
aimed to facilitate precise drug utilization guided by the 
model, thereby optimizing efficacy while minimizing 
potential harm.
