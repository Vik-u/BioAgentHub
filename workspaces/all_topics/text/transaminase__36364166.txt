Abstract: (R)-1-[3,5-bis(triﬂuoromethyl)phenyl]ethanamine, a key chiral intermediate of selective
tetrodotoxin-sensitive blockers, was efﬁciently synthesized by a bienzyme cascade system formed by
with R-ω-transaminase (ATA117) and an alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) co-expression system. Herein,
we report that the use of ATA117 as the biocatalyst for the amination of 3,5-bistrifluoromethylacetophenone
led to the highest efﬁciency in product performance (enantiomeric excess > 99.9%). Moreover,
to further improve the product yield, ADH was introduced into the reaction system to promote
an equilibrium shift. Additionally, bienzyme cascade system was constructed by ﬁve different
expression systems, including two tandem expression recombinant plasmids (pETDuet-ATA117-ADH
and pACYCDuet-ATA117-ADH) and three co-expressed dual-plasmids (pETDuet-ATA117/pET28a-
ADH, pACYCDuet-ATA117/pET28a-ADH, and pACYCDuet-ATA117/pETDuet-ADH), utilizing
recombinant engineered bacteria. Subsequent studies revealed that as compared with ATA117
single enzyme, the substrate handling capacity of BL21(DE3)/pETDuet-ATA117-ADH (0.25 g wet
weight) developed for bienzyme cascade system was increased by 1.50 folds under the condition of
40 ◦C, 180 rpm, 0.1 M pH9 Tris-HCl for 24 h. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the ﬁrst report
demonstrating the production of (R)-1-[3,5-bis(triﬂuoromethyl)phenyl]ethanamine using a bienzyme
cascade system, thus providing valuable insights into the biosynthesis of chiral amines.

1. Introduction
Chiral amines are indispensable building blocks in active pharmaceutical ingredients,
agrochemicals, and bioactive natural products [1,2]. Biocatalytic asymmetric amination has
emerged as an attractive alternative to traditional chemical methods for the synthesis of
chiral amines [3]. Transaminases (TAs) have been used as biocatalysts for the synthesis of
optically pure amines owing to their excellent stereoselectivity, high yield, broad substrate
speciﬁcity, environmental friendliness, and lack of redox cofactor recycling [ 4–6]. TAs
catalyze the transfer of an amino group from an amino donor to a carbonyl moiety via
a ping-pong bi-bi mechanism, utilizing pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP) as a cofactor [7–9].
Regarding the synthesis of chiral amines, TAs are one of the most promising enzymes that
provide a more concise route for reductive amination than their chemical counterparts [10].
Furthermore, they can be divided into α-TAs and ω-TAs, according to the position of
the amino group that is transferred [ 11–13]. α-TAs transfer the amino group at the α-
position of an amino acid, whereas ω-TAs act on the amino group at any position other
than the α-position. In contrast to α-TAs, ω-TAs do not necessarily require a carboxy-
late group in their substrates, which makes them much more versatile for biocatalytic

transformations than the α-TAs [14,15]. Recently, considerable efforts have been made
to discover both (S)- and (R)-selective ω-TAs by screening natural sources and protein
engineering techniques [16–18]. Before the ﬁrst report of (R)-selective ω-TAs (R-ω-TAs) by
Iwasaki et al. [19], the enzymatic synthesis of (R)-amines was attempted using the kinetic
resolution of racemic amines employing (S)-selective ω-TAs (S-ω-TAs) [20]. However,
asymmetric synthesis of (R)-amines using R-ω-TAs has been reported in multiple studies
as their theoretical yield can be 100% [21–23]. A famous example in the biopharmaceutical
industry is the production of sitagliptin (an oral hypoglycemic agent) using engineered
R-ω-TA [24,25]. In the process of developing this biocatalyst, the substrate-binding pocket
of R-ω-transaminase (ATA117, Arthrobacter sp. KNK168) was incrementally adapted to
prositagliptin ketone from wild-type ATA117 (ATA117 WT), yielding a highly active R-ω-
TA variant (ATA117-Rd11) [26,27]. Although ATA117-Rd11 has been successfully employed
in the production of sitagliptin, the substrate scope of the enzyme still requires further
improvement to increase its applicability. Consequently, a series of structural analogs
were selected to explore the potential substrates of ATA117-Rd11, according to the skeletal
structure of the sitagliptin precursor ketone [12,13].
In practical applications, owing to the unfavorable thermodynamic equilibrium, the
suprastoichiometric addition of isopropylamine and in situ removal of the corresponding
acetone by-product are typically required to shift the reaction equilibrium in the desired
direction [28,29]. Accordingly, various process control strategies have been developed
to remove the products in situ, among which cascade reactions employing additional
biochemical reactions of the side products have garnered much attention [30–32]. Multien-
zyme cascade systems that catalyze biological cascade reactions are the result of natural
evolution. Recent studies suggest that the speciﬁc microenvironment created by enzyme
co-localization in conﬁned and/or crowded spaces is a major determinant for increased re-
action efﬁciency, rather than often-cited substrate channeling induced by spatial proximity
of enzymes [33,34]. In those microenvironments, the intermediates are likely ‘pseudo’-
trapped through reversible interactions (i.e., ionic, Van der Waals, hydrogen bonds) that
hamper their dilution into the reaction bulk [ 35]. In this study, a bienzyme cascade sys-
tem of ATA117 and alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH, Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C) was
constructed through co-expression strategies. Equilibrium displacement was enabled by
removing the coproduct acetone employing ADH in combination with NADH [36,37]. The
ADH features a very narrow substrate spectrum and is therefore unable to accommodate
medium or large groups (>C3) [38]. The ATA117/ADH co-expression system was used for
the ﬁrst time to catalyze the asymmetric amination of 3,5-bistriﬂuoromethylacetophenone
(BPO) and prepare (R)-1-[3,5-bis(triﬂuoromethyl)phenyl]ethanamine (R-BPA) [39]. R-BPA
is a chiral intermediate of selective tetrodotoxin-sensitive blockers, which have various
therapeutic uses in pain management. The ADH was introduced in this system to convert
the acetone by-product and improve the ammonia conversion efﬁciency (Figure 1).
The co-expression of multiple enzymes in one host due to the sharing of the protein
synthesis machinery could decrease enzyme production costs compared to individual
enzyme expression in multiple hosts followed by enzyme cocktailing. Therefore, more
attention has been devoted to optimizing the co-expression method of the two enzymes
used to construct a bienzyme cascade system, aiming to improve its catalytic efﬁciency
and yield in transamination reactions in our present study. This was achieved by adjusting
the co-expression mode of the two genes to obtain a high-efﬁciency bienzyme cascade
system. The co-expression system was constructed using a dual-gene tandem expression
system (pACYCDuet-ATA117-ADH and pETDuet-ATA117-ADH) and a dual-plasmid
expression system (pETDuet-ATA117/pET28a-ADH, pACYCDuet-ATA117/pET28a-ADH,
and pACYCDuet-ATA117/pETDuet-ADH). After the successful construction of the above
ﬁve dual-gene co-expression systems (Table 1), the optimal system was selected from
the ﬁve recombinant engineered bacteria of the co-expression systems and the bienzyme
coupling system consisting of ATA117 and an ADH-free enzyme from a single expression
system due to the higher speciﬁc enzyme activity of ATA117 (0.18 U/mg). At 40 ◦C,

207.8 mM substrate BPO was fully converted to the product R-BPA with high selectivity
(99.9%) using BL21(DE3)/pETDuet-ATA117-ADH as a catalyst. In metabolic engineering
and synthetic biology, multiple heterologous genes are usually introduced into one host to
implement a synthesis of a desired compound while the precise control of their expression
levels is of importance to avoid low expression of a rate-limiting enzyme or over-expression
of non-rate-limiting enzymes [40]. The study of the coordinated co-expression levels of
ATA117 and ADH genes in the same host cell provides a reference for the preparation of
drug intermediate BPA.

2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Expression and Puriﬁcation of ATA117 and ADH from Single Expression System
To study the expression of ATA117 inE. coli BL21(DE3), three recombinant plasmids
(pETDuet-ATA117, pACYCDuet-ATA117, and pET28a-ATA117) containing the coding se-
quences for ATA117were constructed. After inducing the expression under their respective
optimal conditions (Table 2), the enzyme was puriﬁed to more than 99% electrophoretic
homogeneity using Ni-NTA agarose afﬁnity chromatography. Furthermore, the SDS-PAGE
analysis (Figure 2A) showed a single band with a molecular mass of ~38 kDa, which is
in agreement with the predicted molecular weight of ATA117 based on its amino acid
sequence. The theoretical size of the ATA117 target protein was predicted to be 36.5 kDa,
while that of the fusion protein was 38.5 kDa. Additionally, the puriﬁed ATA117 exhibited a
speciﬁc activity of 0.18 U/mg toward BPO. Accordingly, the protein expression of the three
recombinant plasmids containing the ATA117 single gene was shown in Figure 2, and their
activity comparison is shown in Table 2. pACYCDuet-1, pET28a, and pETDuet-1 are all
expression plasmids. Among them, pACYCDuet-1 is a low-copy plasmid, whereas pET28a
Molecules 2022, 27, 7331 4 of 17
and pETDuet-1 are high-expression plasmids. Our results showed that the three recombi-
nant plasmids pACYCDuet-ATA117, pET28a-ATA117, and pETDuet-ATA117 successfully
expressed the target protein (Figure 2A). However, among the three recombinant plasmids,
pETDuet-ATA117 showed the highest level of soluble protein expression, whereas a small
portion of the target protein produced by BL21(DE3)/pET28a-ATA117 engineered bacteria
was found to be insoluble. Although the protein expressed by the pET28a-ATA117 engi-
neered bacteria was soluble, its expression level was signiﬁcantly lower than that expressed
by the pETDuet-ATA117 engineered bacteria. Among the three, the expression level of
ATA117 by the pACYCDuet-ATA117 engineered bacteria was the lowest, which might be
attributed to its low copy numbers. Subsequently, by measuring the activity of ATA117, it
was found that ATA117 was best expressed in bacteria transformed with pETDuet-ATA117,
with its activity being determined to be 1.28 times and 2 times that of bacteria transformed
with pET28a-ATA117 and pACYCDuet-ATA117, respectively. Consequently, the pETDuet-1
plasmid was determined to be the most suitable for the efﬁcient expression of ATA117.
The puriﬁcation of ATA117 expressed by E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with pETDuet-
ATA117 was shown in Figure 2B. The results demonstrated that the His-tag was successfully
expressed by the engineered bacteria, and a single band with the same theoretical size
as predicted for ATA117 was obtained by Ni-NTA column puriﬁcation. Similarly, using
E. coli BL21(DE3), two recombinant plasmids (pETDuet-ADH and pET28a-ADH) were
successfully constructed to induce the expression of ADH under their respective optimal
conditions. Post ultrasonication, the product was puriﬁed using a Ni-NTA agarose afﬁnity
chromatography, and its expression and puriﬁcation were detected using SDS-PAGE. The
results demonstrated that the His-tag was successfully expressed by the engineered bacteria
and a single band with the same theoretical size as predicted for ADH was obtained by
Ni-NTA column puriﬁcation (Figure 2C). Subsequent assessment of the enzymatic activities
of ADH expressed by bacteria transformed with pETDuet-ADH and pET28a-ADH revealed
that there was a minute difference between their activities, with the activity of ADH from
pETDuet-ADH transformed bacteria being slightly higher (Table 2).

2.2. Catalytic Properties of Puriﬁed ATA117 Expressed by the E. coli
BL21(DE3)/pETDuet-ATA117 Recombinant Engineering Bacteria
To expand the substrate spectrum of ATA117, the reactivities of 13 different substrates
(amino acceptors) were compared. The results revealed that although the ATA117 catalyzed
reactions using methyl acetoacetate, ethyl acetoacetate, and 3,5-bistrifluoromethylacetophenone
as substrates led to good yields; the corresponding enantiomeric excess was slightly differ-
ent (Table 3). The substrate spectrum of ATA117 is relatively wide. ATA117 can catalyze the
transamination reaction of acetophenone, 3,5-bistriﬂuoromethylacetophenone, benzylace-
tone, and p-methoxyphenylacetone to phenylethylamine, 1-[3,5-bis(triﬂuoromethyl)phenyl]
ethanamine, 4-phenyl-2-butylamine, and 1-(4-methoxyphenyl)propan-1-amine, respec-
tively. Moreover, among them, the reaction with 3,5-bistriﬂuoromethylacetophenone as the
substrate exhibited the dual advantage of substantial yield and better enantioselectivity.
Consequently, it was further selected for subsequent studies.

Reaction system: substrate 43 mM, isopropylamine hydrochloride 215 mM, PLP 1 mM, 15% DMSO, 1 mL of
15 mg/ mL transaminase pure enzyme aqueous solution (total enzyme activity 2.7 U), 0.1 M pH9 Tris-HCl to
make up 2 mL volume.
Additionally, we investigated the effect of pH in the range of pH 6.0–10.0 on the
catalytic performance of ATA117. The results revealed that in the pH range of 6.0–9.0, the
substrate conversion of ATA117 was found to be gradually increasing with pH. However,
the same slightly decreased at pH 10.0 but remained high. Thus, our ﬁndings suggest that
the pH of the reaction medium can affect the enzyme activity, which may be due to the
change in the three-dimensional conformation of the enzyme active site due to a change
in the pH of the reaction medium (Figure 3A). Moreover, the assessment of the relative
activity trend indicated that the ATA117 is alkalophilic. The results showed that when
the pH of the buffer solution was greater than 8.0, the relative activity was found to be
controlled at >80% while all the products at this time were determined to be the target
product R-BPA. As a result, 0.1 M Tris-HCl (pH 9.0) was determined to be the best buffer
for this reaction system. The catalytic activity of an enzyme is signiﬁcantly affected by
temperature as it is lost or inhibited at high temperatures owing to protein denaturation.
Accordingly, our results revealed that the relative activity of ATA117 was initially increased
and subsequently decreased within a certain temperature range (30–50 ◦C) and reached a
maximum at 45 ◦C (Figure 3B).
Additionally, the effects of high concentrations of metal ions and EDTA on ATA117
activity were investigated (Figure 3C). The results demonstrated that, after the addition
of different kinds of metal ions and EDTA, the relative activity of most of the reaction
groups was improved to a certain extent (1.2–1.6 times), while the effect of 10 mM metal
ion chelator EDTA was found to be the most effective (1.5 times). Moreover, the addition of
10 mM Mn2+ and Fe3+ inhibited the TA reaction efﬁciency to varying degrees, with Fe3+
exhibiting the greatest inhibitory effect.
2.3. Comparison of ATA117 Activity from E. coli BL21(DE3)/pETDuet-ATA117 Whole Cells and
Crude Enzyme Solution
According to the method described in Section 3.4.1, the activity of the whole cells
obtained from the fermentation broth and the enzymatic broth after cell disruption was
investigated. The results revealed that the whole cell-associated enzyme activity was 91%
as compared with that of the crude enzyme solution obtained after disruption of the same
amount of the cellular biomass. This ﬁnding is probably attributed to the intracellular
location of ATA117, resulting in a beneﬁcial effect on the ATA117 release post appropriate
cell disruption method. This in turn may lead to more contact between the catalyst and the
substrate, which is conducive to enzymatic activity. Accordingly, considering the maximum
enzymatic activity, the usage of a sonication cytometer was considered the best method to
disrupt the cells for obtaining the crude enzyme solution to complete the double-enzyme
cascade reaction.

Engineered Bacteria
2.4.1. Preparation of R-BPA by Bienzyme Cascade Reaction with Free Enzyme Mixture
Containing ATA117 and ADH
While studying the production of R-BPA using a free bienzyme system, the addition of
ADH, in the range of 30–40◦C, resulted in the evolution of the ATA117-mediated enzymatic
reaction in the forward direction. The investigation showed that the IPA added in a
superstoichiometric amount was converted to form a corresponding acetone by-product,
while ADH catalyzes the reaction of acetone to isopropanol, which can facilitate the removal
of the corresponding acetone by-product. The reaction was thus balanced to proceed in a
forward direction thereby promoting the catalytic efﬁciency of the free bienzyme cascade
reaction using free ATA117 and ADH. When the temperature was further increased to
50 ◦C, the catalytic advantage of the cascade reaction was no longer evident; the yield was
slightly improved as compared with the control group while the ADH was hardly affected
(Figure 4A). When the reaction temperature was 40 ◦C, the yield of the cascade group was
99.9%, while that of the control group was 82.9%. Consequently, a temperature of 40 ◦C
was selected for the bienzyme-catalyzed cascade reaction system. Furthermore, the usage
of different cosolvents exhibited noticeable differences in the solubility of the substrate. The
results revealed that while the type of cosolvent mainly affected the yield to a certain extent,
there was little effect on the enantiomeric excess of R-BPA (Figure 4B), which was controlled
at a high level (≥96%). The data from the enzyme assays using Tween 20 and Tween 80
as cosolvents showed that there is little difference in the effect of Tween-based solvents
on BPO solubilization. Additionally, an assessment of both the yield and enantiomeric
excess (%) revealed that DMSO, ethanol, and glycerol are all suitable cosolvents for the
asymmetric amination of BPO to R-BPA, with DMSO showing the best effect. Consequently,
DMSO was chosen as the optimal cosolvent for the cascade reaction. The co-expression of
multiple enzymes in one host due to the sharing of the protein synthesis machinery could

decrease enzyme production costs compared to individual enzyme expression in multiple
hosts followed by enzyme cocktailing. Therefore, the co-expression of the two enzymes in
the same host was followed up.

2.4.2. Preparation of R-BPA by Bienzyme Cascade System via Co-Expression  
Engineering Bacteria 
Both pACYCDuet-1 and pETDuet-1 plasmids are E. coli protein dual-expression vec-
tors with two multiple cloning sites. Therefore, they can be used to simultaneously express 
two target genes. Accordingly, ATA117 and ADH were simultaneously cloned into the 
pACYCDuet-1 or pETDuet-1 plasmids to achieve dual gene co-expression (pACYCDuet-
ATA117-ADH or pETDuet-ATA117-ADH), thereby also reducing the number of bacterial 
cultures. Subsequently, the protein expression between the two tandemly expressing re-
combinant engineered bacteria was compared using the SDS-PAGE (Figure 5A). The re-
sults revealed that as compared to the pACYCDuet-ATA117-ADH recombinant engi-
neered bacteria, the solubility of the protein expression from the pETDuet-ATA117-ADH 
recombinant engineered bacteria was superior. Furthermore, the amount of target protein 
in the supernatant of pETDuet-ATA117-ADH was found to be higher while the same in 
the cell pellet was found to be lower, which is more in line with the demand. These clearly 
indicate that genes located in pET plasmids had much better expression levels than those 
located in pACYC plasmids, a conclusion consistent with that reported by H. Chen et al. 
[41]. For the multi-gene cluster, the up-stream genes usually have higher expression levels 
than those downstream genes [42], thus arranging the ATA117 gene before the ADH gene.

By pairing two recombinant plasmids with different antibiotic resistance markers, E. 
coli BL21(DE3) cells successfully transformed wi th the two plasmids were screened on a 
plate containing respective antibiotics. As plasmids with similar traits usually have the 
same or similar replication regulation mechanisms, their repressors (repressors or repeats) 
also tend to be similar. Furthermore, during regulation, they can also randomly combine 
with the replication region of any plasmid to inhibit the replication process, thereby re-
sulting in its loss from the progeny cells. Accordingly, this fact is believed to be the reason 
why the pETDuet-ATA117 and pET28a-ADH co mbinations had a weaker growth rate 
than that of the other combinations. Our studies showed that when other combinations 
reached an OD600 of 0.8 in 3 h, pETDuet-ATA117/pET28a-ADH combination took 4 h to 
reach the same OD 600. Moreover, the three dual-plasmid bacteria exhibited a certain de-
gree of expression after being induced by their respective optimal temperatures, while the 
amount of the target protein was not significantly different (Figure 5B). Additionally, the 
ADH fusion protein (39.5 kDa) is 0.5 kDa larger than the ATA117 fusion protein; hence, 
there is a higher possibility of their bands getting partially overlapped during SDS-PAGE. 
Accordingly, considering the stability and spec ific activity of the plasmids (Table 2), 
pACYCDuet-ATA117/pETDuet-ADH was considered the best choice among the three. In 
order to further verify that both ATA117 and ADH can be expressed by recombinant en-
gineering bacteria, the induced bacterial ce lls were sonicated and the supernatant was 
collected. Subsequently, the protein concen tration was determined using the Bradford 
method. The results showed that the co-expressing bacteria could express the two proteins 
normally (Table 2). Additionally, when used in the asymmetric amination reaction of 
207.8 mM BPO, all the five ATA117 and ADH co-expressing recombinant plasmid strains 
achieved a high enantiomeric excess (99%). Notably, the specific activity of ATA117 of the 
E. coli BL21(DE3)/pETDuet-ATA117-ADH recombinant plasmid-engineered strain with 
the best specific activity among the five was determined to be 1.63 times that of the 
pACYCDuet-ATA117/pETDuet-ADH engineered strain.

2.4.3. Comparison of Asymmetric Synthesis of R-BPA Catalyzed by Free Bienzyme and
Co-Expression Engineered Bacteria
When substrate concentration was 166.6 mM, the yield reached 99.9% at 40 ◦C by the
mixture of two free enzymes involving ATA117 and ADH, while 82.9% yield was obtained
with single enzyme ATA117 as catalyst. Furthermore, when the substrate concentration in-
creased to 207.8 mM, the yield decreased to 91.7% by the mixture of two free enzymes, while
the yield reached 99.9% and 91.8% by the whole cell E. coli BL21(DE3)/pETDuet-ATA117-
ADH and E. coli pETDuet-ATA117/pET28a-ADH, respectively. The yield reached 83.1%,
69.6%, and 56.2% with the whole cell E. coli pACYCDuet-ATA117/pETDuet-ADH,E. coli
pACYCDuet-ATA117/pET28a-ADH, andE. coli pACYCDuet-ATA117-ADH (T able 4). Therefore,
it can be inferred that the catalytic activity of E. coli pACYCDuet-ATA117/pETDuet-ADH
was slightly higher than that of pACYCDuet-ATA117/pET28a-ADH. In general, pETDuet-
ATA117-ADH was the best co-expression system among the ﬁve co-expression systems,
and the yield reached 99.9%.

3.3. Expression and Puriﬁcation of ATA117 and ADH from Single Expression System
The gene sequence of ATA117 (GenBank: JA717225) was obtained from the National
Center for Biotechnology Information and was fully synthesized by Shanghai Sangon
Bioengineering Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China. The target gene was constructed using the
cloned plasmid pUC57. ATA117was ampliﬁed according to the method described in Table 1,
and the IPTG-inducible pETDuet-1 expression vector and the ATA117ampliﬁed product
were digested with BamHI (15 U/µL) and XhoI (10 U/µL) restriction enzymes for 3 h. The
resulting enzyme-linked product of puriﬁed linearized pETDuet-1 and the fragment of
ATA117 was transformed into Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). BL21(DE3)/pETDuet-ATA117
positive clones were identiﬁed using colony PCR and gene sequencing. The obtained
transformants were cultured in Luria Bertani (LB) medium containing 50 µg/mL Kan
at 180 rpm and 37 ◦C until the OD600 reached ~0.8. The gene expression was induced
according to the conditions listed in Table 1. Finally, the overexpressing cells were collected
after induction by centrifugation for 10 min at 8000 rpm and 4 ◦C. The cells were then
washed twice with 0.9% (v/w) saline [43]. The harvested cells were resuspended in 100 mM
sodium phosphate buffer (PBS, pH 7.0) at 50 g/L, and the mixture was sonicated for 5 min
(power 400 W, worked for 3 s and spaced for 7 s). The supernatant and precipitation of the
lysate were collected by centrifugation at 8000 rpm and 4 ◦C for 10 min. The expression
of the target enzyme was judged by 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The crude ATA117 enzyme solution was subsequently puriﬁed
using BeyoGold His-tag puriﬁcation resin (Beyotime Biotechnology., Beijing, China). The
protein concentration was measured using the Bradford assay. Protein expression and
molecular weight were determined by 10% SDS-PAGE. The protein bands were visualized
using Coomassie blue stain. Other recombinant plasmids, such as BL21(DE3)/pET28a-
ATA117 were induced and puriﬁed using similar methods.
ADH was codon-optimized and synthesized with an N-terminal His-tag by Beijing
Qingke Biotechnology Technology Co., Ltd., Beijing, China. The gene was then inserted
into an IPTG-inducible pET28a expression vector at BamHI/XhoI restriction sites. The
plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells, which were cultivated at 37 ◦C
and 180 rpm in LB liquid medium (pH 7.0) supplemented with 50 µg/mL kanamycin
and cultured overnight. Expression was induced according to the conditions shown in
Table 2. Extraction and puriﬁcation of the ADH crude enzyme solution were similar to
those employed for ATA117.

in a total volume of 2 mL. The reaction was performed at 40 ◦C and 180 rpm for 2 h and
stopped by the addition of 1 µL triﬂuoroacetate (1%). The BPA products were analyzed by
gas chromatography. Under the above reaction conditions, one unit (U) of enzyme activity
was deﬁned as the amount of enzyme required to produce 1 µmol of R-BPA per min under
standard assay conditions.
3.4.2. Activity of ADH
The enzyme activity determination system for ADH comprised of glycine-sodium
oxide buffer (pH 8.6), 1×10−3 mol/L NAD+, and 5 ×10−3 mol/L ethanol in a total volume
of 5 mL. After warming at 40 ◦C in a water bath for 20 min, the enzyme solution that was
warmed under the same condition was added. After 5 min, the absorbance was measured
at 340 nm every 1 min. The amount of enzyme required for increasing the A340 by 0.001 per
min at 40 ◦C and pH 8.6 was considered to be one unit (U).
3.5. Catalytic Properties of Puriﬁed ATA117 Expressed by the E. coli
BL21(DE3)/pETDuet-ATA117 Recombinant Engineering Bacteria
3.5.1. Substrate Speciﬁcity and Enantioselectivity
The substrate scope of TAs can be considered relatively broad because they are capable
of catalyzing the amination of a wide range of aldehydes and ketones. However, the active
sites of these enzymes contain small and large binding pockets; as a result, wild-type
enzymes are restricted to ketones bearing at least one ‘small’ substituent (methyl or ethyl).
Considerable effort has been directed toward increasing the capacity of the small binding
pocket for enabling these enzymes to accept ketones with two bulky substituents; ATA117
is one such successful example. Accordingly, to examine the substrate speciﬁcity of ATA117,
the reactivity of 13 amino acceptors was compared (Table 3).
3.5.2. Effects of pH and Temperature on Enzyme Activity
The optimum pH for the reaction with 832.8 mM IPA and 166.6 mM BPO was deter-
mined at 40 ◦C using different buffer systems (100 mM) in the pH range of 6.0 and 10.0.
Accordingly, sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0–8.0), Tris-HCl (pH 8.0–9.0), and glycine-
NaOH (pH 9.0–10.0) were used for this purpose. To investigate the effect of temperature on
the enzyme activity, the reaction was carried out at different temperatures ranging from
30–50 ◦C at pH 9.0, using IPA as the amino donor and BPO as the amino acceptor.
3.5.3. Effects of Metal Ions and Reagents on Enzyme Activity
The effects of metal ions and reagents on ATA117 activity were studied by pre-
incubating the enzyme with the metal ions and reagents in Tris-HCl buffer (0.1 M, pH
9.0) for 1 h at 40 ◦C. The ﬁnal concentration of Ca2+, Mg2+, Cu2+, Fe2+, Zn2+, Mn2+, Na+,
K+, and EDTA was 10 mM, and the activity of ATA117 was determined under standard
conditions. The relative activity (%) was calculated using the activity determined without
adding any metal ions as a control (100%).
3.5.4. Comparison of ATA117 Activity from E. coli BL21(DE3)/pETDuet-ATA117 Whole
Cells and Crude Enzyme Solution
After 15 h of induction at 18 ◦C, the overexpressed cells were collected by centrifuga-
tion at 8000 rpm and 4 ◦C for 10 min. The cell pellets were washed twice with 0.9% (v/w)
saline and resuspended in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The suspension
was divided into two equal parts. Subsequently, half of the volume of the resuspension
was removed and subjected to ultrasonic disruption (power 400 W, worked for 3 s, and
Molecules 2022, 27, 7331 14 of 17
spaced for 7 s) for 5 min at 4 ◦C. The cell suspension was then centrifuged at 8000 rpm for
10 min. After centrifugation, the supernatant was used as a crude enzyme solution. The
enzyme activity determination method described in Section 2.4.1 was used to determine
and compare the activity of the crude enzyme solution and the whole-cell catalytic reaction.
3.6. Preparation of Bienzyme Cascade System by Two Different Ways: Free Single Enzyme and
Co-Expression Engineering Bacteria
The coupling system of ATA117 and ADH was divided into two main steps; (1) the
amination reaction of BPO followed by (2) the in situ removal of the by-products. The
latter reaction converts the acetone by-product of the former reaction into isopropyl alcohol,
which improves the efﬁciency of the amination reaction of BPO, the substrate (Figure 1).
The preparation of the bienzyme cascade system included the preparation of a bienzyme
coupling system composed of ATA117 and an ADH-free enzyme along with the preparation
of ﬁve double-gene co-expression systems.
3.6.1. Preparation of R-BPA by Bienzyme Cascade Reaction with Free Enzyme Mixture
Containing ATA117 and ADH
Substrate BPO (166.6 mM substrate BPO dissolved in 0.3 mL cosolvent DMSO),
832.8 mM amino donor IPA, 1 mM cofactor PLP , 1×10−3 mol/L cofactor NADH, 18 mg
ADH (0.15 U/mg), and 15 mg ATA117 (0.18 U/mg) were added to the reaction system,
and 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0) was used to supplement the system to form a cascade
reaction group. The reaction system was maintained at 30, 35, 40, 45, and 50 ◦C for 24 h
at 180 rpm. A system without ADH was used as the blank control group. Considering
the effect of substrate solubility, various cosolvents, such as methanol, ethanol, Tween 80,
Tween 20, Span 80, glycerol, and DMSO, were additionally evaluated for their effects on
the cascade reaction of the bienzyme system.
3.6.2. Preparation of R-BPA by Bienzyme Cascade System via Co-Expression Engineering
Bacteria Constructed by Two Double-Gene Tandem Co-Expression Systems
Engineered BL21(DE3)/pETDuet-ATA117-ADH and BL21(DE3)/pACYCDuet-ATA117-
ADH were expressed under their respective optimal induction conditions (Table 2). After
induction, the fermentation broth was centrifuged at 8000 rpm and 4 ◦C for 10 min to
remove the medium components. The cells were then washed three times with an appro-
priate amount of normal saline to ensure that the medium components were removed.
The treated wet cells (0.25 g) were resuspended in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0), and
the system was made up to 1.4 mL. Substrate BPO (207.8 mM substrate BPO dissolved
in 0.3 mL cosolvent DMSO), 1038.8 mM amino donor IPA, and 1 mM cofactor PLP were
added to the above system, and 2 mL of the reaction system was made up of 0.1 M Tris-HCl
buffer (pH 9.0). The reaction system was maintained at 40 ◦C and 180 rpm for 24 h.
3.6.3. Preparation of R-BPA by Bienzyme Cascade System via Co-Expression Engineering
Bacteria Constructed by Two-Plasmid Co-Expression System
The BL21(DE3)/pACYCDuet-ATA117 and BL21(DE3)/pET28a-ADH strains were
cultured in a 37 ◦C/180 rpm constant-temperature incubator until the OD 600 reached
0.8. Next, 10 µL of the puriﬁed pACYCDuet-ATA117 and pET28a-ADH plasmids were
transformed into BL21(DE3) competent cells, simultaneously. After activation for 1 h,
the cells were spread on LB solid medium containing two antibiotics (Cm 34 and Kan50),
and the culture was inverted overnight to screen the positive clones containing the two
recombinant plasmids. Using the same method, the puriﬁed pETDuet-ATA117 and pET28a-
ADH plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3) cells similar to the pACYCDuet-ATA117
and pETDuet-ADH plasmids. It should be noted that the medium must be screened by
the simultaneous addition of antibiotics to both plasmids. The construction and culture
conditions of E. coli transformed with pETDuet-ATA117 and pET28a-ADH have been
mentioned in Section 3.3 and hence, not mentioned here again. The construction and
culture conditions of the other two recombinant plasmids, pACYCDuet-ATA117 and
Molecules 2022, 27, 7331 15 of 17
pETDuet-ADH, required for the construction of double-plasmid engineered bacteria are
listed in Table 2. After induction, the fermentation broth was centrifuged at 8000 rpm and
4 ◦C for 10 min to remove the medium components. The cells were then washed three
times with an appropriate amount of normal saline to ensure that the medium components
were removed. The treated cells (0.25 g) were resuspended in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer (pH 9.0)
and the system was made up to 1.4 mL. BPO substrate (207.8 mM) dissolved in 0.3 mL
cosolvent DMSO, 1038.8 mM amino donor IPA, and 1 mM cofactor PLP were added to the
above system. Finally, 2 mL of the reaction system was made up with 0.1 M Tris-HCl buffer
(pH 9.0). The reaction system was maintained at 40 ◦C and 180 rpm for 24 h.
4. Conclusions
Biocatalysis has a proven track record in providing alternatives to individual chemical
reactions with less impact on the environment. Cascade reactions are an extension of
biocatalysis that couples a series of reactions and thus can provide alternatives to multiple
chemical steps. Cascade reactions also offer several other advantages over conventional
biocatalysis. In particular, they provide a way to utilize enzymes that are close to equilib-
rium or have unstable substrates or products. In a cascade reaction, side reactions are also
minimized as successive reactions that push the equilibrium in favor of thedesired product.
In the present study, 50 g/L R-BPA was synthesized usingE. coli BL21(DE3)/pETDuet-
ATA117-ADH as the best catalyst because of its excellent yield (99.9%) and high enan-
tiomeric excess (99.9%). To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst report utilizing
the combined application of ATA117 and ADH in the production of R-BPA to achieve
more efﬁcient biological transamination. This method is suitable for the amine transfer
reaction with IPA as the donor. On this basis, it can be applied to amination of a variety
of substrate ketones, such as acetophenone series compounds. In this study, we have
demonstrated the unique advantages and complementary potential of the bienzyme pair in
an established cascade system, with signiﬁcantly improved substrate handling capacity and
speciﬁc activity of bienzyme cascade system. The current study thus provides a feasible
and comprehensive strategy to combine ATA117 and ADH for the efﬁcient production of
chiral amines with engineered bacteria in addition to providing valuable insights into the
synergy of bienzymes in biocatalysis.
