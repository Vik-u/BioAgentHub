Abstract: Enhancing the thermostability of (R)-selective amine transaminases (AT-ATA) will expand
its application in the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines. In this study, mutual information and
coevolution networks of ATAs were analyzed by the Mutual Information Server to Infer Coevolution
(MISTIC). Subsequently, the amino acids most likely to inﬂuence the stability and function of the
protein were investigated by alanine scanning and saturation mutagenesis. Four stabilized mutants
(L118T, L118A, L118I, and L118V) were successfully obtained. The best mutant, L118T, exhibited an
improved thermal stability with a 3.7-fold enhancement in its half-life ( t1/2) at 40 ◦C and a 5.3 ◦C
increase in T5010 compared to the values for the wild-type protein. By the differential scanning
ﬂuorimetry (DSF) analysis, the best mutant, L118T, showed a melting temperature (Tm) of 46.4 ◦C,
which corresponded to a 5.0 ◦C increase relative to the wild-type AT-ATA (41.4◦C). Furthermore, the
most stable mutant L118T displayed the highest catalytic efﬁciency among the four stabilized mutants.

1. Introduction
Chiral amines are indispensable building blocks for numerous biologically active compounds and
active pharmaceutical ingredients [1–3]. Transaminases are pyridoxal-5-phosphate (PLP)-dependent
enzymes that can reversibly catalyze the transfer of an amino group from an amino donor to a prochiral
ketone substrate [1,4]. In particular, amine transaminases (ATAs) have become the most prominent
biocatalysts for the generation of optically pure chiral amines because of their high stereoselectivity and
environmentally benign reaction conditions [2,5–7]. However, in industrial applications, biocatalysts,
such as ATAs, are often required to enhance the rate of a reaction and the solubility of the reactant
while simultaneously diminishing the risk of microbial contamination. The development of enzymes
with a higher thermostability would expand the applicability of ATAs in industrial processes.
To enhance the thermal stability of an (R)-selective amine transaminase from Aspergillus terreus
(AT-ATA), rational strategies, such as the combination of the B-factor proﬁle and folding free energy
calculations ( ∆∆Gfold), the introduction of disulﬁde bridges, and consensus mutagenesis, were

investigated [8–10]. Recently, the fact that a protein can be considered as a network of interacting
residues has attracted great interest [11–14]. Speciﬁcally, nodes represent residues in a residue-residue
coevolution network, and links are based on mutual information (MI), which is commonly based
on Shannon’s entropy [15]. Residues are considered to be coevolving in the protein structure when
a mutation at one position is compensated by a mutation at another position among homologous
proteins [16,17]. An MI network can be developed to predict the location of different functional residues
in protein families [17,18]. This strategy can not only reveal the relationship between the amino acid
residues in a protein in terms of their structure and function but also make up for shortcomings in
traditional directed evolution and rational design methods, effectively improving the efﬁciency of the
molecular modiﬁcation of enzymes. Hence, the analysis of MI networks is a promising method to
guide the modiﬁcation of proteins.
To minimize the effort and time invested in screening, various computational methods and the
corresponding web-based tools have been used to identify mutation sites that are functionally or
structurally important for proteins [19–23]. Compared to other publicly available web servers, the
Mutual Information Server to Infer Coevolution (MISTIC) server provides integrated and concise
insights into sequence and structure information in a visually rich manner. Particularly, the use of a
circos representation of MI networks, the visualization of the cumulative MI (cMI), and proximity MI
(pMI) concepts is original [23].
In this study, the MISTIC web server was used to predict the functional residues in the AT-ATA
coevolution network. Subsequently, the effects of these functional residues on the enzymatic
characteristics of AT-ATA were experimentally veriﬁed.
2. Results
2.1. Analysis of the Mutant AT-ATAs by Alanine Scanning
MISTIC provided an integrated view of AT-ATA in regards to the MI between residues (Figure S1A,
in the Supplementary Materials), sequence conservation, cMI, and pMI. The cMI score and pMI score
were both signiﬁcant predictors of the functional residues of the protein. Residues with high cMI scores
were rich in shared MI; residues with high pMI scores were mostly located in proximity to functionally
important residues (distance < 5 Å) (Figure S1B). High degrees of conservation at some residue
positions indicated relatively lower rates of change during protein evolution. Further, an MI Circo was
prepared (Figure S2), which is a circular representation of the mapped reference sequence using the
information obtained from the MISTIC server [23]. Eight residues with important interactions were
identiﬁed (Figure 1a) with MI, conservation, cMI, and pMI scores of 15, 1, 556, and 1984, respectively.
We then performed an alanine scanning of these eight amino acid residues (H76, F115, E117, L118,
N181, W184, T274, and T275). Among these substitutions, the variant L118A exhibited an enhanced
thermostability in comparison to the wild-type enzyme with a nearly 3-fold increase in the half-life
(t1/2) at 40 ◦C and a T5010 value of 42.2 ◦C (that of the wild-type enzyme was 38.5 ◦C). However,
variants such as H76A, N181A, W184A, T274A, and T275A had decreased enzyme activities (Figure S3).
As shown in Figure 1a, the residues mentioned above are mostly highly conserved; once these residues
were replaced with alanine, the stable conformation was likely changed.

2.2. Saturation Mutagenesis of Residue L118 
The saturation mutagenesis library of residue L1 18 was prepared with the goal of keeping the 
screening effort to a minimum and rapidly determining the hot spot for further engineering. 
Approximately 300 colonies were randomly selected from the saturation mutagenesis library. The 
results of the first round are shown in Figure S4. The enzymatic activities of the mutants before and 
after heating at 50 °C (for 10 min) are presented in Figure S4A and Figure S4B, respectively. 
Accordingly, the enzyme activity of each clone without heat treatment was assumed to be 100%, and 
the relative activities of the enzymes in the corre sponding wells were calculated (Figure S4C). The 
colonies with an apparently enhanced thermostab ility were isolated and verified by sequencing. 
Finally, four potential mutants (L118T, L118I, L118A, and L118V) were obtained. 
2.3. Thermal Stability of AT-ATA and its Variants 
As shown in Figure 2, the four purified variants (L118T, L118I, L118A, and L118V) showed a 
single band with the same molecular weight as the wild-type enzyme.

The saturation mutagenesis library of residue L118 was prepared with the goal of keeping
the screening effort to a minimum and rapidly determining the hot spot for further engineering.
Approximately 300 colonies were randomly selected from the saturation mutagenesis library.
The results of the ﬁrst round are shown in Figure S4. The enzymatic activities of the mutants before and
after heating at 50 ◦C (for 10 min) are presented in Figure S4A,B, respectively. Accordingly, the enzyme
activity of each clone without heat treatment was assumed to be 100%, and the relative activities of the
enzymes in the corresponding wells were calculated (Figure S4C). The colonies with an apparently
enhanced thermostability were isolated and veriﬁed by sequencing. Finally, four potential mutants
(L118T, L118I, L118A, and L118V) were obtained.
2.3. Thermal Stability of AT-ATA and its Variants
As shown in Figure 2, the four puriﬁed variants (L118T, L118I, L118A, and L118V) showed a
single band with the same molecular weight as the wild-type enzyme.
The inactivation of the three mutants (L118T, L118I, and L118V) from the saturation mutagenesis
library was evaluated. As shown in Figure 3a, theT5010 values for the L118T, L118I, and L118V mutants
increased to 43.8 ◦C, 41.6 ◦C, and 40.7 ◦C, which correspond to increases of 5.3 ◦C, 3.1 ◦C, and 2.2 ◦C
over that of the wild-type enzyme (38.5 ◦C), respectively. In addition, the t1/2 values of the L118T,
L118I, and L118V variants were 26 min, 18.4 min, and 15 min, respectively, compared to 6.9 min for the
wild-type AT-ATA (Figure 3b). Notably, L118T displayed the largest improvement in thermal stability
among the four variants. Additionally, the optimum catalytic temperatures of the L118I, L118V , and
L118A variants were higher than that of the wild-type enzyme (Figure 3c).
The thermal unfolding of proteins was monitored by differential scanning ﬂuorimetry (DSF) in
the presence of SYPRO orange dye. When the protein unfolded, the hydrophobic parts were exposed
to the dye. In DSF, the ﬂuorescence intensity is plotted as a function of temperature (Figure S5).

Tm values (2.1, 1.5, 0.9, and 5.0 ◦C, respectively) than the wild-type enzyme.

library was evaluated. As shown in Figure 3a, the T5010 values for the L118T, L118I, and L118V

2.4. Kinetic Constants 
The kinetic constants of the AT-ATA and its variants were determined by monitoring the initial 
reaction rates at different concentrations of pyruvate and ( R)-α-methylbenzylamine ((R)-α-MBA) as 
substrates, and the reaction was triggered by adding enzyme at the appropriate concentration. The 
Michaelis constants (Kmpyruvate for pyruvate and Kmα-MBA for (R)-α-MBA) and maximum velocity for the 
reaction (Vmax) were obtained from the Lineweaver–Burk plot, and the turnover number (kcat) and the 
catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) were calculated (Table 2). The most obvious change in catalytic efficiency 
(kcat/Kmpyruvate) was observed for the mutant L118T (2.22 to 4.85 s −1·mM−1), but this value decreased to 
1.76 s−1·mM−1 for the mutant L118I. Noticeably, all four stabilized mutants showed higher values of 
kcat/Kmα-MBA, and the mutant L118T showed the greatest increase in the kcat/Kmα-MBA value (from 2.82 to

The kinetic constants of the AT-ATA and its variants were determined by monitoring the initial
reaction rates at different concentrations of pyruvate and ( R)-α-methylbenzylamine ((R)-α-MBA)
as substrates, and the reaction was triggered by adding enzyme at the appropriate concentration.
The Michaelis constants (Kmpyruvate for pyruvate and Kmα-MBA for (R)-α-MBA) and maximum velocity
for the reaction ( Vmax) were obtained from the Lineweaver–Burk plot, and the turnover number
(kcat) and the catalytic efﬁciency ( kcat/Km) were calculated (Table 2). The most obvious change in
catalytic efﬁciency (kcat/Kmpyruvate) was observed for the mutant L118T (2.22 to 4.85 s−1·mM−1), but
this value decreased to 1.76 s−1·mM−1 for the mutant L118I. Noticeably, all four stabilized mutants
showed higher values of kcat/Kmα-MBA, and the mutant L118T showed the greatest increase in the
kcat/Kmα-MBA value (from 2.82 to 9.98 s−1·mM−1). The results for Kmpyruvate revealed that the mutants
had lower binding afﬁnities for the substrate than the wild-type enzyme. In contrast, the results of
Kmα-MBA indicated that all four stabilized mutants had even greater substrate-binding afﬁnities than
the wild-type enzyme. The most obvious change in the Kmα-MBA value was the decrease from 0.23 to
0.13 mM observed for the mutant L118I.

2.5. The Asymmetric Synthesis of α-MBA Catalyzed by AT-ATA and the Mutant L118T
The asymmetric synthesis of chiral amine α-MBA was performed using AT-ATA and the mutant
L118T (Scheme 1). The standard samples ( R)-α-MBA and (S)-α-MBA were derivatized with chiral
Marfey’s reagent (N-α-(2,4-dinitrophenyl-5-ﬂuorophenyl)-L-alanine amide, FDAA) to determine the
conﬁguration of the product by ultra-performance liquid chromatography coupled with electrospray
ionization quadrupole time-of-ﬂight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/ESI-QTOF-MS) on a Waters
Acquity H-Class UPLC system coupled with a Xevo G2-XS mass spectrometer. As shown in Figure 4a,
the extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) of the Marfey’s derivatives revealed the presence of FDAA
with mass-to-charge (m/z) = 271, FDAA-2-butylamine with m/z = 324, and FDAA-(R)-α-MBA and
FDAA-(S)-α-MBA with m/z = 372, but FDAA-(R)-α-MBA (1.61 min) and FDAA-(S)-α-MBA (1.81 min)
had slightly difference retention times. In Figure 4b, the EIC of the Marfey’s derivatives revealed
the presence of FDAA-L-alanine with m/z = 340 and FDAA-(R)-α-MBA and FDAA-(S)-α-MBA with
m/z = 372; FDAA-(R)-α-MBA (3.85 min) and FDAA-(S)-α-MBA (4.24 min) showed different retention
times. However, the (S)-α-MBA signal was not detected by the UPLC-MS analysis as a product of the
transamination reaction. This result conﬁrmed that the product generated by AT-ATA and the mutant
L118T was (R)-α-MBA rather than (S)-α-MBA, and the substitution of Leu118 with Thr had no effect
on the chiral selectivity of AT-ATA.

substrate than the wild-type enzyme. In contrast, the results of Kmα-MBA indicated that all four 
stabilized mutants had even greater substrate-binding affinities than the wild-type enzyme. The most 
obvious change in the Kmα-MBA value was the decrease from 0.23 to 0.13 mM observed for the mutant 
L118I.

2.5. The Asymmetric Synthesis of α-MBA Catalyzed by AT-ATA and the Mutant L118T 
The asymmetric synthesis of chiral amine α-MBA was performed using AT-ATA and the mutant 
L118T (Scheme 1). The standard samples ( R)-α-MBA and ( S)-α-MBA were derivatized with chiral 
Marfey’s reagent (N-α-(2,4-dinitrophenyl-5-fluorophenyl)-L-alanine amide, FDAA) to determine the

ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC/ESI-QTOF-MS) on a Waters 
Acquity H-Class UPLC system coupled with a Xevo  G2-XS mass spectrometer. As shown in Figure 
4a, the extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) of the Marfey’s derivatives revealed the presence of FDAA 
with mass-to-charge ( m/z) = 271, FDAA-2-butylamine with m/z = 324, and FDAA-( R)-α-MBA and 
FDAA-(S)-α-MBA with m/z = 372, but FDAA-(R)-α-MBA (1.61 min) and FDAA-(S)-α-MBA (1.81 min) 
had slightly difference retention times. In Figure 4b, the EIC of the Marfey’s derivatives revealed the 
presence of FDAA-L-alanine with m/z = 340 and FDAA-(R)-α-MBA and FDAA-(S)-α-MBA with m/z 
= 372; FDAA-( R)-α-MBA (3.85 min) and FDAA-( S)-α-MBA (4.24 min) showed different retention 
times. However, the (S)-α-MBA signal was not detected by the UPLC-MS analysis as a product of the 
transamination reaction. This result confirmed that the product generated by AT-ATA and the 
mutant L118T was (R)-α-MBA rather than (S)-α-MBA, and the substitution of Leu118 with Thr had 
no effect on the chiral selectivity of AT-ATA.

3. Discussion 
To expand its industrial application for the production of chiral amines, most ATAs for 
biocatalysis need to be stabilized. In this study, we analyzed the MI for this protein family using the 
MISTIC server to identify the functional amino ac id residues. The results of the alanine scanning 
indicated that L118A substitution resulted in an increase in the enzyme activity by approximately 
2.5-fold compared to that of the wild-type protein (Figure S2). According to the crystal structure of 
AT-ATA, it follows a similar dual binding mode: The bulky substituent of the aromatic amine or 
ketone substrate and the α-carboxylate of the keto acid or amino acid are accommodated by the large 
binding pocket defined mainly by the hydrophobic residues His55, Tyr60, Phe115, Glu117, Leu182, 
and Trp184, and the methyl group was accommodated in the small binding pocket lined by Val62,

3. Discussion
To expand its industrial application for the production of chiral amines, most ATAs for biocatalysis
need to be stabilized. In this study, we analyzed the MI for this protein family using the MISTIC server
to identify the functional amino acid residues. The results of the alanine scanning indicated that L118A
substitution resulted in an increase in the enzyme activity by approximately 2.5-fold compared to
that of the wild-type protein (Figure S2). According to the crystal structure of AT-ATA, it follows a
similar dual binding mode: The bulky substituent of the aromatic amine or ketone substrate and the
α-carboxylate of the keto acid or amino acid are accommodated by the large binding pocket deﬁned
Molecules 2019, 24, 1194 8 of 13
mainly by the hydrophobic residues His55, Tyr60, Phe115, Glu117, Leu182, and Trp184, and the methyl
group was accommodated in the small binding pocket lined by Val62, Phe115, Thr274, Thr275, and
Ala276 [24]. Surprisingly, residue 118 was adjacent to the large and small substrate binding pockets.
The key residue Leu118 was subjected to saturation mutagenesis, and the mutant L118T was found to
have a T5010 value that was 5.8 ◦C higher and a t1/2 value that was 3.8-fold higher at 40◦C compared to
the corresponding values of the wild-type enzyme. To the best of our knowledge, the increase of 5.3◦C
in the value of T5010 observed in this study is the largest increase that has ever been achieved through
a single mutation (Table S2). The present coevolution network of wild-type AT-ATA, determined in
this study, makes it well-suited to low temperatures. When Leu118 was replaced with Thr118, the
existing balance between structure and functional of the AT-ATA coevolution network was broken and
the new network endowed it with a higher thermostability.
4. Materials and Methods
4.1. Molecular Biology Tools and Reagents
The AT-ATA cDNA sequence, including theNcoI and XhoI restriction sites, and all the primers
used for mutagenesis were synthesized by General Biosystems (AnHui) Co., Ltd. (Chuzhou, China).
The recombinant plasmid pET28a-AT-ATA was used as the template. PrimeSTAR ® Max DNA
polymerase was acquired from Takara Biotechnology (Dalian, China). Lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), L-alanine, acetophenone, 2-butylamine, imidazole, isopropyl-β
-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), and Ni-IDA-Seﬁnose ™ resin kits were purchased from Sangon
Biotech Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). The SYPRO orange dye was purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad,
CA, USA).
4.2. In Silico Analysis Procedure
The multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of the ATA family was uploaded from Pfam (Pfam
accession PF01063). The reference sequence and structure were set as A3XII7_LEEBM/39–275 and
PDB code 4CE5 [ 24], respectively. The complete alignment was performed by the MISTIC server
(http://mistic.leloir.org.ar) [22]. After calculating the MI scores of the residues, a network was created
in which the residues were nodes and a signiﬁcant coevolutionary signal could be obtained through
the links between those nodes (Figure S1A). Finally, eight functionally important residues, shown in
Figure 1a, were screened based on their conservation, MI, cMI, and pMI scores.
4.3. Alanine Scanning of the AT-ATA Coevolution Network
The eight residues of the AT-ATA coevolution network were analyzed by alanine scanning to
identify their functional contributions. The sequences of all the mutagenic primers are displayed in
Table S1. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was carried out in an Applied Biosystems Veriti 96-well
Thermal Cycler according to the method of Lin et al. [25]. The mixture consisted of PrimeSTAR Max
Premix 2×(25 µL), pET28a(+)-AT-ATA plasmid (50 ng), forward and reverse primers (10µM, 1 µL of
each), and autoclaved water to a ﬁnal volume of 50µL. The PCR was cycled 30 times with the following
program: 98 ◦C for 15 s (denaturation), 55 ◦C for 15 s (annealing), and 72 ◦C for 2 min (extension).
The PCR products were digested with Dpn I (10 U; 37 ◦C, 3 h), puriﬁed, and then transformed into
competent E. coli DH5αcells by the heat shock method. The transformed cells were incubated at
37 ◦C overnight on a Luria–Bertani (LB) agar plate containing 50 mg/L kanamycin. The recombinant
plasmid DNA was isolated and veriﬁed by sequencing for further analysis.
4.4. Construction of the Saturation Mutagenesis Library
After alanine scanning mutagenesis, residue L118 was randomly replaced by saturation
mutation, and the primers used to amplify the AT-ATA genes were 5′-GCATTTGTTGAANNNATAGT
CACCCG-3′ (forward) and 5 ′-GCGGGTGACTATNNNTTCAACAAATGCATC-3′ (reverse). The
Molecules 2019, 24, 1194 9 of 13
PCR mixture for the saturation mutagenesis consisted of PrimeSTAR Max Premix 2 ×(25 µL),
pET28a(+)-AT-ATA (1µL), the forward and reverse primers (10 µM, 1 µL each), and sterile water to a
ﬁnal volume of 50 µL. The mixture was subjected to 1 cycle of 98 ◦C (1 min); 40 cycles of 98 ◦C (15 s),
55 ◦C (15 s), and 72 ◦C (1 min); and 1 cycle of 72 ◦C (7 min). The PCR products were treated with DpnI
and transformed into E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells by electroporation.
4.5. Library Screening
Nearly 300 colonies were randomly picked from the saturation mutagenesis library with sterile
toothpicks and grown in a deep 96-well plate containing 1 mL LB medium with 50 mg/L kanamycin.
When the optical density at 600 nm (OD600) reached 0.6–0.8, IPTG was added to each well at a ﬁnal
concentration of 1 mM. After the induction at 25 ◦C and the incubation for 20 h with shaking at
150 rpm, the 96-well plate was centrifuged at 4500 rpm for 10 min, the supernatant was discarded, and
the cells were washed with buffer A (50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0) twice. Subsequently,
the cells were resuspended in 200 µL of buffer a containing 5 mg/mL lysozyme and incubated at 37 ◦C
for 30 min.
After centrifugation, 80 µL of the supernatant was removed from each well of the mother 96-well
plate and transferred to the corresponding well of a daughter 96-well plate and heated at 50 ◦C for
10 min. After incubation, the plate was rapidly cooled in an ice bath and the activity of the enzyme
was assayed at room temperature. The initial enzyme activity without heat treatment (control) was
determined and used for a comparison. The mutants with higher residual activities than that of
wild-type AT-ATA were further screened.
4.6. Protein Expression and Puriﬁcation
One BL21(DE3) E. coli colony harboring wild-type AT-ATA or its variants in pET28a(+) was
incubated in 2 mL of the LB medium containing kanamycin (50 mg/L) at 37 ◦C and 200 rpm overnight.
The overnight culture was added to 200 mL of LB medium and then incubated at 200 rpm and 37 ◦C.
When the OD600 reached approximately 0.6, the culture was incubated at 25 ◦C and 150 rpm in the
presence of 1 mM IPTG. Subsequently, the cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 rpm for 10 min
at 4 ◦C and washed twice with buffer A. The cells were resuspended in 30 mL of disruption buffer B
(300 mM NaCl, 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer, 20 mM imidazole, and pH 8.0) and disrupted
by ultrasonication for 15 min (sonication power, 300 W; duty time, 3 s; and interval time, 6 s).
The intracellular protein was released, and the extract was centrifuged at 8000 rpm for 35 min at
4 ◦C; the supernatant was ﬁltered through a 0.45-µm ﬁlter. The soluble recombinant proteins with an
N-terminal His6-tag were puriﬁed by a Ni-afﬁnity column. The puriﬁed proteins were eluted with
elution buffer C (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM sodium phosphate, and pH 8.0) containing 250 mM imidazole.
SDS-PAGE (12% separating and 5% stacking gels) was used to conﬁrm the purity and molecular mass
of the puriﬁed proteins. Furthermore, the concentration of the puriﬁed enzymes was estimated using
a modiﬁed Bradford protein assay kit (Sangon Biotech Co., Ltd. Shanghai, China) [26].
4.7. Enzyme Assay and Kinetic Parameters
The enzyme activities of the wild-type enzyme and its mutants were investigated according to the
method of Schätzle et al. [27]. Unless otherwise indicated, the transamination reaction of the AT-ATA
and its mutants was measured by monitoring the production of acetophenone at 245 nm using a
microplate reader (SpectraMax 190; Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). Each measurement
was repeated at least three times. The reaction mixture contained 2.5 mM R-MBA, 2.5 mM pyruvate,
0.25% (w/v) DMSO, 0.1 mM PLP in 180 µL of phosphate buffer A, and 20 µL of puriﬁed enzyme
(0.1 mg/mL). Under these conditions, one unit of enzyme activity was deﬁned as the amount of
enzyme that generated 1 µmol of acetophenone per minute. The kinetic constants for ( R)-α-MBA
and pyruvate were determined by measuring the activities at different substrate concentrations when
either pyruvate or R-MBA was held at 2.5 mM and the other substrate was present at 0, 0.125, 0.25,
Molecules 2019, 24, 1194 10 of 13
0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, or 3.0 mM. To calculate the kinetic constants, the obtained data were ﬁtted to the
Michaelis–Menten equation in Origin 8.0 (OriginLab Corp., Northampton, MA, USA).
4.8. The Thermal Stability of AT-ATA and its Mutants
4.8.1. Kinetic Stability of AT-ATA and its Mutants
The T5010 value refers to the temperature at which the enzyme activity was reduced to half of the
original activity after heat treatment for 10 min. The puriﬁed AT-ATA and its mutants were incubated
for 10 min at temperatures from 25 to 55 ◦C in 5 ◦C increments and then cooled on ice for 10 min.
The reaction was triggered by the addition of each enzyme, and the initial rate of the increase in
absorbance at 245 nm was measured. The activity of the enzyme at 4◦C after 10 min was taken as 100%.
To calculate the kinetic constants, the obtained data were ﬁtted to the a four-parameter Boltzmann
sigmoidal equation in Origin 8.0.
The t1/2 values of the AT-ATA and its mutants at 40 ◦C were determined by incubating the
samples for various periods and then keeping them on ice for 10 min. The residual activity of each
sample was detected at room temperature as described above. The activity of the corresponding
enzyme without incubation at the same temperature was deﬁned as 100%. The effects of temperature
on the activity of the wild-type and mutant AT-ATA were determined by measuring the production of
acetophenone at various temperatures for 3 min.
4.8.2. Thermodynamic Stability of AT-ATA and its Mutants
Differential scanning ﬂuorimetry (DSF) is an inexpensive and rapid method to identify the
thermodynamic stability of puriﬁed enzymes. The wild-type enzyme and its mutants were analyzed
using the method of Niesen et al. [28] with minor modiﬁcations.
The mixture consisted of 100 µg/mL pure enzyme, 1 ×SYPRO Orange dye, buffer D (150 mM
NaCl, 50 mM sodium phosphate, and pH 8.0), with a total volume of 50 µL. The samples with dH2O
instead of pure enzyme were used as the negative control. Subsequently, the measurements were
made on a StepOne Plus ™ Real-Time PCR System (version 2.2.2, Applied Biosystems, Foster, CA,
USA). Temperatures from 25 to 70 ◦C were scanned in increments of 0.7 ◦C, with each temperature
maintained for 30 s. The ﬂuorescence intensity was recorded with a 490 nm excitation wavelength and
a 605 nm emission wavelength. The melting temperature (Tm) of AT-ATA was calculated using the
following equation:
y = UF + (NF −UF)
1 + e
(Tm−x)
a
(1)
where UF and NF are the values of the minimum and maximum ﬂuorescence intensities, respectively,
and a denotes the slope of the curve within Tm.
4.9. UPLC-MS Analysis of the Product of the Transamination Reaction
In the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines catalyzed by AT-ATA and the mutant L118T, the
selection of an appropriate amino donor and the elimination of the by-product inhibition were of great
importance [29,30]. The sodium phosphate reaction buffer (50 mM, pH 8.0) containing 0.1 mM PLP
was mixed with acetophenone (30 mM) and L-alanine or 2-butylamine (120 mM). The transamination
reaction was triggered by the addition of puriﬁed enzyme coupled with LDH, and the mixture was
shaken at 30 ◦C for 24 h.
The products of the transamination reactions catalyzed by AT-ATA and the mutant L118T were
analyzed by UPLC-MS (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) according to the method of Xie et al. [10]. When
2-butylamine was used as an amino donor, the conditions for the UPLC analysis were as follows: an
ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 column (Waters, Milford, MA, USA) (2.1 ×100 mm, 1.8 µm) was used with
a ﬂow rate of 0.30 mL/min, and the mobile phase was a 35:65 ( v/v) eluent A (0.1% formic acid in
water (dH2O)) and eluent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile). When L-alanine was used as the amino
Molecules 2019, 24, 1194 11 of 13
donor, the conditions for the UPLC analysis were as follows: an HSS T3 column was used, and the
gradient elution conditions were 0–0.5 min (55:45), 3–4 min (35:65), and 4.5–5 min (55:45) at a ﬂow
rate of 0.30 mL/min. All samples were analyzed in negative ionization mode. The mass spectrometer
conditions were as follows: cone voltage 40 V and ramp collision energy 20–55 V . The mass spectrum
was acquired over the range of m/z 50–1200 Da.
5. Conclusions
A novel method involving an analysis of the MI to infer the functionally important residues
was used to guide the molecular modiﬁcation of AT-ATA. TheT5010 and t1/2 values of the stabilized
mutants at position 118 were greater than those of the wild-type enzyme by 2.2–5.3◦C and 8.1–19.1 min,
respectively. As measured by DSF, the Tm value of the most stable mutant L118T reached 46.4 ◦C,
which corresponded to an increase of 5 ◦C. Furthermore, the kcat and kcat/Km values of L118T were
at least 2-fold higher than those of the wild-type enzyme. More importantly, the UPLC-MS analysis
proved that the substitution of Leu118 with Thr had no effect on the chiral selectivity of AT-ATA.
These results established a solid basis for future alterations to the design of ATA to further enhance its
catalytic efﬁciency and thermostability, which is a prerequisite for applying this novel biocatalyst in
the synthesis of chiral amines.
