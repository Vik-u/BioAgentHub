Abstract: Alcohol and drug overdoses cause liver diseases such as cirrhosis, hepatitis, and liver cancer
globally. In particular, an overdose of acetaminophen (APAP), which is generally used as an analgesic
and antipyretic agent, is a major cause of acute hepatitis, and cases of APAP-induced liver damage
are steadily increasing. Potential antioxidants may inhibit the generation of free radicals and prevent
drug-induced liver damage. Among plant-derived natural materials, radishes (RJ) and turnips (RG)
have anti-inﬂammatory, anticancer, and antioxidant properties due to the presence of functional
ingredients, such as glucosinolate and isothiocyanate. Although various functions have been reported,
in vivo studies on the antioxidant activity of radishes are insufﬁcient. Therefore, we aim to evaluate
the hepatoprotective effects of RG and RJ in APAP-induced liver-damaged mice. RG and RJ extracts
markedly improved the histological status, such as inﬂammation and inﬁltration, of mice liver
tissue, signiﬁcantly decreased the levels of alanine transaminase, aspartate aminotransferase, and
malondialdehyde, and signiﬁcantly increased the levels of glutathione, superoxide dismutase and
catalase in the APAP-induced liver-damaged mice. In addition, RG and RJ extracts signiﬁcantly
increased the expression of Nrf-2 and HO-1, which are antioxidative-related factors, and regulated
the BAX and BCL-2, thereby showing anti-apoptosis activity. These results indicated that RG and RJ
extracts protected mice against acute liver injury, attributed to a reduction in both oxidative stress
and apoptosis. These ﬁndings have clinical implications for the use of RG and RJ extracts as potential
natural candidates for developing hepatoprotective agents.

1. Introduction
As an essential metabolic organ, the liver transports waste from the body and produces
bile acids that break down fat and convert chemical drugs into non-toxic forms [1]. The
prevalence of acute liver failure has been increasing due to external (virus, drug overdose)
or internal (oxidative stress, metabolic disorder) effects, threatening human health world-
wide [2]. In particular, the onset of acute liver failure results from drug-induced liver injury
(DILI), and most drugs can cause liver damage [3]. When DILI is induced, the mitochon-
drial respiratory chain is inhibited, reactive oxygen species (ROS) increase, and adenosine
triphosphate depletion occurs [4]. For this reason, mitochondrial dysfunction causes cell
apoptosis by regulating the expression of proapoptotic proteins B-cell lymphoma protein 2
(BCL-2) and BCL-2-associated X (BAX), along with oxidative stress [5,6]. Among the many
drugs that cause DILI, acetaminophen (APAP) is the most studied [7].
APAP is the most used antipyretic and analgesic drug; it is safe and effective when
administered at a therapeutic dose [ 8,9]. However, APAP overdose produces the toxic
metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI), which depletes the antioxidant glu-
tathione (GSH) and induces oxidative stress via ROS generation, further exacerbating liver

damage [10]. Owing to this risk, the number of hospital visits and hospitalizations of
patients with APAP-induced acute hepatotoxicity has been steadily increasing yearly. How-
ever, there are few treatment options for APAP-induced liver damage, and N-acetylcysteine
(NAC) is the only clinically available drug. NAC is usually administered orally or in-
travenously and has been reported safe even at high doses [ 11]. However, various side
effects have been reported in cases of overdose, depending on the route of administration.
Oral administration causes nausea and vomiting, and intravenous administration causes
anaphylactic reactions such as skin rashes and dyspnea [12,13]. To compensate for these
shortcomings, many experiments have been conducted on the ability of natural materials,
or active compounds isolated from natural materials, to protect against APAP-induced
liver toxicity.
The radish (Raphanus sativusL.) is a representative root vegetable of the family Brassi-
caceae, which is extensively cultivated worldwide. Recently, the production of radishes in
Korea has reached approximately 1,168,000 tons per year [14]; more than 30% are grown
in Jeju, and the cultivated area is continuously increasing. Radishes are an agricultural
product with excellent nutritional value owing to their rich moisture and ﬁber content,
and high content of vitamins A and C. In addition, they have traditionally been known to
have various beneﬁts, such as digestion-promoting, stomach-protecting, anti-inﬂammatory,
anticancer, antioxidant, and hemostatic beneﬁts [ 15]. These physiological effects can be
observed in various functional ingredients such as glucosinolates [ 16], isothiocyanates,
ﬂavonoids, anthocyanins, alkaloids, saponins, and phenolic acids, which are abundant
in radishes [17].
Turnips (Brassica rapaL.) have red roots, unlike radishes, and represent a local specialty in
Korea, grown on the Ganghwa Island. Turnips contain not only various functional ingredients
contained in radishes, but also a large number of antioxidants such as anthocyanins [18,19].
As such, studies on the various physiological activities of radishes and turnips with
numerous functional ingredients are being conducted, but studies on the hepatoprotec-
tive effects and mechanism of radishes or turnips, and relevant comparative studies, are
still insufﬁcient.
As reported by Parikh et al. [ 20], phenolic compounds of Indian mustard extract,
quercetin and catechins, decreased ROS levels, alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate
aminotransferase (AST) levels in APAP-induced HepG2 cells, thus the hepatoprotective
effect of the Brassicaceae’s functional ingredients was conﬁrmed. Based on the study of
hepatoprotective effects of Indian mustard extract, a member of the Brassicaceae family, it
is also expected that radishes and turnips will have hepatoprotective effects.
Therefore, this study intends to provide basic data for the potential use of radishes and
turnips as functional materials by comparing their hepaprotective effects and mechanism
on APAP-induced acute liver injuries in mice.

2.2. Preparation of Sample Extract
The two species of vegetables used in this study; turnips of Ganghwa (RG) and
radishes of Jeju (RJ), were purchased from the local markets of Ganghwa and Jeju Islands,
South Korea, respectively. We used only the roots in the experiment. The RG and RJ
roots were washed thoroughly with distilled water, dried using hot air at 60 ◦C for 24 h
(DS-240BC, DooSung Co., Ltd., Gwangju, Korea), and pulverized using a grinder (IKA,
M20, IKA, Staufen, Germany) to prepare the extract. Extraction was performed by adding
70 % ethanol 20 times to the crushed RG and RJ (2.5 kg), stirring at room temperature for
24 h (SMHS-6, DAIHAN Co., Wonju, Korea), and then adding equal volume of solvent
as was used in the ﬁrst extraction to the remaining amount of the solute. The extract
was ﬁltered through ﬁlter paper (No. 1, Whatman International Ltd., Maidstone, UK),
concentrated using a rotary evaporator (EYELA CCA-1110, Rikakikai Co., Tokyo, Japan),
and freeze-dried. The freeze-dried sample extract was stored at −20 ◦C until further use.
The yields of RG and RJ extracts were 12% and 26%, respectively.
2.3. Animal Experiments
Experiments were performed using BALB/c mice (male, 6-week-old) weighing20–24 g,
purchased from Central Lab Animal Inc. (Seoul, Korea). The animals were retained in
a temperature-controlled facility (22 ±2 ◦C) and a 12 h light-dark cycle. The mice were
allowed ad libitum access to food and water during the experimental period. The use of
experimental animals was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee
of the National Institute of Agricultural Sciences (NAS-202204).
After a week of acclimatization, all mice were randomly divided into the following
seven groups (n = 7 per group): (1) normal, no sensitization with phosphate buffered saline
(PBS); (2) control (CTRL), APAP + PBS; (3) NAC, APAP + 75 mg/kg NAC; (4) RG low (RG
500), APAP + 500 mg/kg RG; (5) RG high (RG 1000), APAP + 1000 mg/kg RG; (6) RJ low
(RJ 500), APAP + 500 mg/kg RJ; (7) RJ high (RJ 1000), APAP + 1000 mg/kg RJ. The study
design is shown in Table 1. The samples were orally administered (p.o.) to the mice once
daily for 4 weeks. The dose of NAC used in the experiment was established according to
the method of Saba et al. [21]. The food intake and body weight of the mice were measured
weekly. Food intake was calculated as the amount of food consumed per week and the
remaining amount from the feed provided.

After 4 weeks, to induce acute liver injury, mice were intraperitoneally injected with
500 mg/kg body weight of APAP , or an equal volume of PBS, followed by starvation for
24 h. At the end of the treatment period, all mice were anesthetized using CO2 inhalation
and sacriﬁced. Blood was centrifuged to separate the plasma for biochemical analyses. The
liver, spleen, kidney, heart, and colon were dissected, rinsed with PBS, and weighed. Part
of the liver tissue was ﬁxed with formalin for histological analysis, and the remaining was
immediately frozen at −80◦C until further use.

2.4. Measurement of Plasma Aminotransferase Levels
Liver injury was evaluated by measuring biomarkers, such as serum ALT and AST
levels, using commercial assay kits. Antioxidant enzyme production from plasma was
evaluated using commercial kits.
2.5. Measurement of Antioxidant Enzymes and Lipid Peroxidation in Plasma
The concentrations of GSH, antioxidant enzymes, such as SOD, CAT, and the lipid
peroxide marker malondialdehyde (MDA) were measured using an ELISA kit. All kits
were used according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2.6. Histopathologic Examination
For histological analyses, liver samples (n = 7 per group) were ﬁxed in 4% formalin,
dehydrated, parafﬁn-embedded, and sectioned into 5 µm slices. The tissues were then
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Pathological changes in the tissues were
observed at 200 ×magniﬁcation using a camera attached to a microscope (Eclipse TE200,
Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). Congestion and inﬁltration of liver tissue were observed in more
than 10 ﬁelds of 7 different tissue sections. All histopathologic analyses were performed by
an experimenter blinded to the treatment group.
2.7. RNA Isolation and Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Analysis
Total RNA from animal liver tissue was isolated using a RNeasy Plus Mini Kit (Qiagen,
Valencia, CA, USA). cDNA was then synthesized using M-MLV reverse transcriptase
(Promega, Madison, WI, USA), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The target gene
expression level of the synthesized cDNA was measured using the amﬁSure qGreen Q-
PCR Master Mix (GenDEPOT), and a real-time polymerase chain reaction machine. For
relative quantiﬁcation, mRNA expression was normalized to the levels of glyceraldehyde
3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The primers used are listed in Table 2.

2.8. Western Blot Analysis
Liver tissues were lysed using radio immune precipitation assay buffer on ice, and
centrifuged at 12,000×g for 20 min at 4 ◦C, for protein extraction. Proteins were quantiﬁed
using the BCA protein assay. Ten micrograms of protein were separated using 4–20%
sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and transferred to
PVDF membranes. The transferred membranes were blocked using 5 % (w/v) skim milk in
Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween® 20 Detergent (1 h at room temperature, followed
by overnight incubation at 4 ◦C with β-actin, SOD, CAT, GPx, Nrf2, HO-1, BCL-2, BAX,
cleave-Caspase-3 (c-Casp3), and cleave-Caspase-9 (c-Casp9). Subsequently, the membranes
were washed and incubated with the secondary antibodies for 1 h at room temperature.
The bands were visualized using an enhanced chemiluminescence reagent (Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc, Rockford, IL, USA), and images were captured using a ChemiDoc image detector.

2.9. Statistical Analyses
Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS version v25.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA).
Data are expressed as the mean ±standard error (SE) and were analyzed using one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA). Following this, the data were analyzed post hoc using
Duncan’s multiple range test and marked with different letters. Statistical signiﬁcance was
set at p < 0.05.

To determine the effectiveness of RG and RJ administration, the intake by experimental
animals was set to 500 and 1000 mg/kg, respectively, and clinical symptoms were observed
during oral administration every day for 4 weeks. There was no signiﬁcant difference in
the body weight and average food intake of the mice for 4 weeks between the CTRL, RG
and RJ administered groups (Figure 1 and Figure S1), and no speciﬁc symptoms such as
odd behavior, ocular protrusions, and hair loss were observed in any of the test groups. In
addition, the body weight gain and tissue (liver, spleen, kidney, heart, and colon) weights
of mice showed no signiﬁcant difference between the groups (Table 3).

In contrast, the NAC group showed signiﬁcantly (p < 0.05) reduced ALT and AST levels.
Compared with the CTRL group, the groups pretreated with RG and RJ showed signiﬁ-
cantly (p < 0.05) decreased ALT and AST levels. In particular, the high concentration radish
extract treatment group showed ALT and AST levels similar to the NAC group in the
normal range. When only RG and RJ were ingested, the hepatotoxicity index showed no
signiﬁcant difference compared to the normal group (Figure S2). Therefore, RG and RJ
alleviated APAP-induced hepatotoxicity (Figure 2).

These results were further confirmed using histopathological analysis (Figure 3). In 
the liver tissue of the normal group, the status of the hepatocyte cells was normal, and no 
damage was observed. In contrast, in the CTRL group, which was administered only with 
APAP, significant injury to the liver structure, such as congestion of the central vein and 
neutrophils infiltration, was observed. Conversely, in the NAC group, the size and degree 
of infiltration of inflammatory cells decreased and liver tissue injury recovered. In addi-
tion, in the experimental group administered with APAP and radish extracts, inflamma-
tory cell infiltration and congestion were reduced in a concentration-dependent manner, 
improving liver tissue injury. In particular, in the RG 1000 and RJ 1000 group, congestion 
of the central vein decreased to a similar degree as that in the NAC group, and infiltration 
of inflammatory cells was significantly reduced compared to that in the CTRL group. 
Therefore, it was confirmed that RG and RJ extracts alleviated liver damage.

liver tissue injury. In particular, in the RG 1000 and RJ 1000 group, congestion of the central
vein decreased to a similar degree as that in the NAC group, and inﬁltration of inﬂammatory
cells was signiﬁcantly reduced compared to that in the CTRL group. Therefore, it was
conﬁrmed that RG and RJ extracts alleviated liver damage.

3.4. Effects of Radish Extracts on Antioxidant Enzymes and Glutathione Production in APAP-
Induced Liver-Damaged Mice 
When excessive oxidative stress is generated in the body, the antioxidant system sup-
presses oxidative stress by generating antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, GPx, and CAT 
[23]. However, as APAP depletes the GSH and causes liver damage, the depletion of GSH 
reduces the activity of antioxidant enzyme s SOD and CAT, causing oxidative stress 
[24,25]. Accordingly, we measured the production of GSH and antioxidant enzymes (SOD 
and CAT) after RG and RJ treatment in APAP-induced mice with liver damage. As shown 
in Figure 4, significant decreases in GSH, SOD, and CAT levels were evident in the CTRL 
group compared to those in the normal group, whereas the NAC group recovered GSH, 
SOD, and CAT levels. Compared with the CTRL  group, groups pretreated with RG and 
RJ had significantly increased SOD and GSH production. Plasma CAT levels were signif-
icantly increased in the RG treatment group.

3.5. Effects of Radish Extracts on Lipid Peroxidation in APAP-Induced Liver-Damaged Mice 
Lipid peroxidation increases during excessive oxidative stress, which primarily con-
tributes to the generation of a number of secondary products, including aldehydes such 
as MDA, causing direct damage to the cell membrane [26]. Thus, the MDA concentration 
was measured to evaluate the effect of RG and RJ extract treatment on lipid peroxidation 
(Figure 5). Compared to the normal group, the CTRL group showed dramatically in-
creased MDA levels (p < 0.05), whereas significantly decreased MDA levels were observed 
in the NAC group. In addition, MDA levels were significantly reduced in the RG and RJ 
groups, compared with those in the CTRL group, and recovered to a level similar to that 
of the normal group.

3.6. Effects of Radish Extracts on the mRNA Expression of Antioxidant Enzymes in APAP-

The quantification results of plasma antioxidant enzymes confirmed that RG and RJ 
promoted antioxidant enzyme production in APAP-induced liver-damaged mice. To de-
termine whether a similar tendency is observed in liver tissue as s een in the results of 
plasma analysis, the protein and mRNA expression of antioxidant enzymes, Sod, Cat, and 
Gpx were further analyzed (Figure 6). Compared with the normal group, the CTRL group 
showed dramatically decreased mRNA expression of Sod, Cat (p < 0.05), and Gpx (p < 0.05), 
while significantly increased expression levels were exhibited in the NAC group. De-
creased Sod and Cat mRNA expression levels in the CTRL group caused oxidative stress. 
These levels significantly increased after the oral administration of RG and RJ to APAP-
induced liver-damaged mice, and recovered to a level similar to that in the NAC group. 
The mRNA expression of Gpx showed a tendency to increase. In addition, it was con-
firmed that the protein expression of antioxidant enzymes was decreased by APAP and 
further increased in a dose-dependent manner after RG and RJ treatment.

3.7. Effects of Radishes Extract Regulated Nrf2/HO-1 Signaling Pathway in APAP-Induced 
Liver-Damaged Mice 
To gain further insights into the molecular mechanisms of RG and RJ functions as an 
antioxidant, the Nrf2/HO-1 mechanism factor was examined using western blotting (Fig-
ure 7). Nrf2 forms a complex with Kelch-li ke ECH-associated protein 1 (Keap1) under 
normal circumstances and exists in an inactivated state [27] and is a major regulator of the 
antioxidant defense mechanism of cells [28]. After oxidative stress stimulation occurs, it 
is separated from Keap1, moves into the nucleus, binds to the antioxidant response ele-
ment (ARE) site, and expresses HO-1, a sign aling downstream factor [29,30]. The ex-
pressed HO-1 activates antioxidant enzymes such as SOD, CAT, etc., and activates the 
antioxidant system. 
The expression of Nrf2 significantly increased in the RJ-treated groups compared to 
the CTRL group. In addition, the HO-1 protei n expression was restored by ingestion of 
RG and RJ at 1000 mg/kg. 
Disruption of this oxidative stress-relieving mechanism or excessive ROS generation 
induces apoptosis. Apoptosis destroys cellular metabolic function owing to DNA damage, 
and the activity of the pathway leading to this is regulated by BCL-2 and its antagonist, 
BAX [31]. BCL-2 protein expression was decreased in the oxidative stress-induced group 
(CTRL) compared to that in the normal group, and the expression of BAX increased, con-
firming apoptosis. As a result of ingestion of RG and RJ extracts for 4 weeks in mice with 
an activated apoptotic mechanism, the expression of BCL-2 and BAX were restored to the

is released by regulating the activity of apoptosis factors. The apoptosome converts pro-
caspase 9 to its active form, cleaved caspase-9, and further activates the effector caspase-

groups as opposed to the CTRL group, which promoted apoptosis.

4. Discussion
APAP is a general drug that exhibits antipyretic and analgesic effects when taken
within the normal range [34]. However, as overdose of the drug causes acute liver failure,
the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011 limited the daily dose of APAP not
to exceed 325 mg, and recommended a daily dose of 4 g [ 35]. APAP overdose causes
acute liver failure because the liver’s rapid metabolic rate makes it vulnerable to drugs
and toxins [36]. These APAP-induced hepatotoxicity symptoms are known to be mainly
regulated by the mechanisms of inﬂammation, autophagy, and oxidative stress [ 37–39].
Therefore, developing effective compounds that regulate the primary mechanisms to
alleviate and prevent APAP-induced hepatotoxicity is essential.
In this study, the hepatoprotective effect and mechanism of action of RG and RJ, which
are natural plant-derived substances, were investigated in APAP-induced liver-damaged
mice to test whether they could prevent and alleviate diseases caused by oxidative stress
and apoptosis.
First, we measured the production of biochemical markers, such as ALT and AST,
which indicate the presence of liver damage. It was conﬁrmed that serum ALT and AST
levels increased in the group (CTRL) induced by oxidative stress with APAP and recovered
to the normal group levels in the RG and RJ extracts.
Second, when oxidative stress occurs, the antioxidant system protects the tissues in
the body, and antioxidants are produced for smooth metabolic activity. SOD converts
superoxide radicals (O2•−) into molecular oxygen (O2) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to
prevent cellular damage by ROS [40]. GSH removes excess ROS and plays a vital role in
protecting the cells from oxidative stress. In addition, lipid hydrogen peroxide and free
hydrogen peroxide produced during oxidative stress are reduced to the corresponding
alcohols and water by GPx [41]. Hydrogen peroxide is a harmful by-product of metabolic
processes. It must be converted into other less hazardous substances to prevent damage to
cells and tissues; thus, CAT needs to be rapidly generated to catalyze its decomposition into
gaseous oxygen and water molecules [42]. As such, all factors must play their respective
roles for the antioxidant system to work. If any of these factors are depleted or the function
is impaired, an error in the antioxidant system leads to cell damage and apoptosis. Overdose
of APAP depletes GSH in the liver. GSH depletion inhibits the decomposition of superoxide
radicals, which in turn affects SOD activity and ROS removal, leading to acute liver
failure [24,25]. As a result, the dysfunction of the antioxidant system occurs as a chain
reaction. Therefore, this study estimated the amount of antioxidant enzymes in blood after
radish intake in the APAP-induced liver-damaged mice. It was conﬁrmed that the blood
levels of GSH, antioxidants SOD and CAT, and lipid peroxide MDA, were regulated by RG
and RJ extract treatment, as opposed to the CTRL group. This result is consistent with the
ﬁnding that APAP-induced acute liver damage decreases antioxidant GSH activity and
increases lipid peroxide production [43]. As the regulation of lipid peroxide production
is essential for the prevention of liver damage and is regulated by the antioxidant system,
Nutrients 2022, 14, 5082 12 of 16
RG and RJ suppressed the production of lipid peroxide by increasing the production of
antioxidants, thereby demonstrating antioxidative effects [44].
Finally, an overdose of APAP causes liver damage; therefore, a histopathological study
was performed. APAP administration externally changed the liver’s color, inﬂammation,
cell inﬁltration, and central venous congestion as observed via H&E staining. These results
conﬁrm that APAP induces liver toxicity, resulting in liver tissue inﬂammation and cell
inﬁltration [45]. However, the symptoms were relieved in a dose-dependent manner by RG
and RJ extracts. Accordingly, RG and RJ proved effective in protecting the liver.
After conﬁrming the hepatoprotective effect of radish extract using liver toxicity indi-
cators such as blood antioxidant enzymes, lipid peroxide, and histopathological analysis,
we measured the expression of factors involved in the antioxidant pathway, Nrf2/HO-1
and BCL-2/BAX, to determine the detailed hepatoprotective mechanism of radish and
turnip extracts. The expression of antioxidant enzymes SOD, CAT, GPx, and antioxidant
system regulator Nrf2/HO-1 in the liver damage-induced group was reduced and reversed
by the RG and RJ extracts. In addition, the expression of BCL-2, BAX, c-Caspase3, and
c-Caspase9, which are related to apoptosis control pathways, also showed contrasting
trends in the RG and RJ groups compared to those of the CTRL group. Our results showed
that RG and RJ upregulated the Nfr2 upstream factor and the downstream factor HO-1,
thereby increasing antioxidant enzyme activity. In addition, it has been demonstrated
that it regulates mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis via Bcl-2 and Bax [46], and inhibits
proteolytic activity and apoptosis by inhibiting caspase3 and caspase9 [47].
These results are similar to those previously reported on the association between oxida-
tive stress and apoptosis. Among several antioxidant mechanisms, Nrf2/HO-1 signaling
plays a vital role in cell migration, growth, and death [48]. The pathway of Nrf2 is a key
sensor that protects cells from oxidative stress by inducing cytoprotective gene transcription
and is linked to cytoplasmic Keap1 in steady state. At this time, when ROS is excessively
generated by oxidative stress, Keap1 releases Nrf2 and then migrates to the nucleus where
it binds to AREs associated with other transcription factors and helper proteins. It induces
transcription of several antioxidant genes, such as NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1
(NQO1), HO-1, glutamate-cysteine ligasecatalytic subunit (GCLC), CAT, and SOD [49,50].
In addition, there are an increasing number of studies that can support Nrf2, the antioxidant
key modulator, as an important factor in improving liver damage [51,52]. It is known that
Nrf2 activates HO-1 expression, and upregulates the apoptosis inhibitor BCL-2, and on the
contrary, downregulates the expression of BAX, c-Caspase3, and c-Caspase9 [53,54]. Studies
indicate that oxidative stress is improved and apoptosis is suppressed by Nrf2, a multi-
signaling pathway modulator [55]. Homing et al. [56] conﬁrmed that the hepatoprotective
effect of Lico A against acetaminophen-induced hepatotoxicity was via the regulation of
Nrf2 and c-Caspase3, and the knockout of hepatocyte-speciﬁc JNK can alleviate mitochon-
drial oxidative stress and reduce apoptosis and liver damage [57]. Therefore, our radish and
turnip extracts are also assumed to regulate oxidative stress and apoptosis by activating
the Nrf2 factor. This effect may be attributed to glucosinolate, a compound in Brassicaceae.
Glucosinolate is a sulfur-containing substance mainly found in the Brassica family, and has
been reported to possess various physiological effects, such as anti-inﬂammatory and anti-
cancer activities [58,59]. Isothiocyanate, a secondary hydrolysate formed by glucosinolate
hydrolysis, is a biologically active compound with anticarcinogenic [60] and antifungal [61]
properties. In particular, it regulates the Keap1/Nrf2/ARE pathway and promotes antioxi-
dant and apoptotic effects in cancer cells [58]. Additionally, various functions related to
the hydrolysis of glucosinolate metabolites have been reported. Phenethyl isothiocyanate,
released when the tissue of Brassica vegetables is destroyed, induces apoptosis via the acti-
vation of proteins (mitogen-activated protein kinases, c-Jun-N-terminal kinase, extracellular
protein kinase, and p38) in colon cancer cells HT29 [62,63]. Sulforaphane (SFN), another
glucosinolate hydrolysis product, is used primarily as an enzyme, a cell cycle arrest regula-
tor, an antioxidant, and an anticancer agent [64]. SFN treatment in HepG2 cells increases
GSH levels, thus demonstrating antioxidant effects by inhibiting ROS production [65]. In
Nutrients 2022, 14, 5082 13 of 16
addition to the functional components, the antioxidant and anticancer effects of Brassica
vegetables are correlated with the presence of natural antioxidant vitamins A, C, and E [59].
Taken together, it was conﬁrmed that in the RG and RJ extract treatment groups,
liver damage and antioxidant enzyme expression levels were restored to the levels of the
NAC group or the normal group in APAP-induced liver-damaged mice. In particular,
the hepatoprotective, antioxidant and anti-apoptotic effects were the greatest at a concen-
tration of 1000 mg/kg of the two extracts, and there was no signiﬁcant difference in the
efﬁcacy between the two extracts. These results are thought to be due to the components
commonly included in the two extracts. In order to elucidate the exact mechanism of the
hepatoprotective effects of radishes and turnips, research on active components and clinical
studies should be conducted in the future. Moreover, the correlation between analysis of
ingredients and functionality by harvest period and cultivation area should also be studied.
5. Conclusions
This study demonstrated the hepatoprotective effects of RG and RJ by regulating
antioxidant and anti-apoptotic signaling factors. An overdose of APAP induces oxidative
stress and apoptosis, ultimately resulting in liver damage. As this phenomenon could be
successfully alleviated by RG and RJ extracts, further studies on the mechanism can aid in
the use of radish and turnip extracts as potential natural candidates for the development of
hepatoprotective agents.
