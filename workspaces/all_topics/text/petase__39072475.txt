ABSTRACT: The enzyme PETase fromIdeonella sakaiensis
(IsPETase) strain 201-F6 can catalyze the hydrolysis of poly-
ethylene terephthalate (PET), mainly converting it into mono(2-
hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET). In this study, we used
quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulations
to explore the molecular details of the catalytic reaction mechanism
of IsPETase in the formation of MHET. The QM region was
described with AM1d/PhoT and M06-2X/6-31+G(d,p) potential.
QM/MM simulations unveil the complete enzymatic PET
hydrolysis mechanism and identify two possible reaction pathways
for acylation and deacylation steps. The barrier obtained at M06-
2X/6-31+G(d,p)/MM potential for the deacylation step corre-
sponds to 20.4 kcal/mol, aligning with the experimental value of 18
kcal/mol. Our findings indicate that deacylation is the rate-limiting step of the process. Furthermore, per-residue interaction energy
contributions revealed unfavorable contributions to the transition state of amino acids located at positions 200−230, suggesting
potential sites for targeted mutations. These results can contribute to the development of more active and selective enzymes for PET
depolymerization.

INTRODUCTION
The advent of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has
significantly transformed modern human civilization, offering
versatile applications across the plastics industry. However,
synthetic polymers like PET-based plastic waste continue to
present environmental challenges, threatening ecosystems and
biodiversity due to their strong resistance to biodegrada-
tion.
1−5
Enzymatic hydrolysis offers an alternative way to selectively
generate monomers under mild conditions, thereby circum-
venting the use of chemical waste such as organic solvents.
6
Ideonella sakaiensis strain 201-F6 was recently discovered with
the ability to degrade and use synthetic polymers, such as PET,
as its major energy and carbon source.
7
This discovery has
paved the way for novel scientific investigations aimed at
identifying eco-friendly alternatives for managing plastic waste
through enzymatic recycling at moderate temperatures (20 to
45 °C).
8−11
The Yoshida group demonstrated that I. sakaiensis expresses
two closely related enzymes involved with PET degrada-
tion.
7,12
The first enzyme is named PETase (PET-digesting
enzyme), which converts PET to mono(2-hydroxyethyl)
terephthalic acid (MHET), bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-TPA
(BHET), and terephthalic acid (TPA) as products. The
second enzyme is the MHETase (MHET-digesting enzyme),
which further converts MHET into two monomers: ethylene
glycol (EG) and TPA.
13
Structural and evolutionary studies of
I. sakaiensis PETase (IsPETase) have shown that its structure
resembles α/β-hydrolase enzymes.
14−16
The α/β-hydrolase
family includes lipases and cutinases, which catalyze the
hydrolysis of fatty acids and cutin, respectively.
14−16
Several studies have proposed a molecular mechanism for
PET degradation catalyzed by IsPETase.
14,17,18
Moliner and
colleagues investigated the atomic-level mechanism of the
IsPETase enzyme using computational methods, outlining a
four-step process for IsPETase that involved two or three
monomers and a semiempirical potential with DFT correc-
tions. They have found that acylation and deacylation take
place in a stepwise mechanism.
19
Subsequently, Carola and co-
workers conducted a similar study on IsPETase, suggesting
that both acylation and deacylation proceed through a single,
associative, tetrahedral transition state in a concerted yet
asynchronous manner.
20
Both contributions
19,20
have pro-
posed that acylation is the rate-limiting step of the process. On
the other hand, Knott et al. demonstrated that the deacylation
step is the rate-limiting catalytic mechanism of MHETase.

They have also proposed that MHETase’s catalytic mechanism
occurs without stable tetrahedral intermediates, with acyl-
enzyme intermediate formation (acylation) and hydrolysis
(deacylation) taking place as individual steps.
21
These studies
employed benchmark simulations using free energy surfaces
and a quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM)
approach to explore PET degradation catalyzed by IsPETase
and MHETase.
19−21
Previously, we investigated the conformational dynamics of
IsPETase in response to PET binding, highlighting details of its
structural adaptability and regions of flexibility that could be
targeted to enhance enzyme stability and efficacy.
22
Here, we
present a QM/MM study of PET degradation by IsPETase,
focusing on the formation of the product MHET using a PET
tetramer. We have compared our results with recently
published computational studies
19−21
and further developed
the current general model of the catalytic mechanism of
IsPETase.
■
THEORETICAL METHODS
As described in the Introduction section, IsPETase catalyzes
PET degradation into MHET, BHET, and TPA (Scheme 1),
with MHET as the major product of IsPETase.
7
The PET-
binding mode has been predicted mostly through computa-
tional methods.
16,23,24
Recently, we proposed the binding
mode of PET into the active site of IsPETase and provided
molecular details of PET’s main interaction using molecular
docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations.
22
Here,
we used the PET-IsPETase complex described before
22
as a
starting point to explore the catalytic mechanism of IsPETase
for PET degradation into MHET and BHET. The system
consists of the tetramer (2-hydroxyethyl-(monohydroxyethyl
terephthalate)
4
, 2-HE(MHET)
2
) in the complex with
IsPETase, additional details regarding the initial structure
used for the simulation can be found elsewhere.
22
The Free Energy Surface (FES). To obtain the FES
associated with MHET formation, we have used the weighted
histogram analysis method (WHAM) combined with the
umbrella sampling approach
25
as implemented in the
pDynamo program.
26
The PMF calculation requires a series
of molecular dynamics simulations in which the distinguished
reaction coordinate variable, ξ, is constrained around particular
values.
27
In the QM/MM approach, a small part of the system
(ligand/substrate species) is described by quantum mechanics,
while MM force fields represent the protein and solvent
environment.
28
The 2D PMFs were obtained for the
mechanism of MHET formation. A wide range of semi-
empirical methods are used within hybrid QM/MM
simulations to study different systems, including metallic
nanoparticles
29
and enzymatic reactions.
30
Semiempirical
potentials can be based on s and p orbitals (MNDO, AM1,
PM3, and RM1) or also included orbitals, either based on
approximations to Hartree−Fock theory (MNDO/d, PM6,
and AM1/d-PhoT) or derived from density functional theory
(DFTB3).
30
In this study, the AM1d/PhoT potential was used
to describe the QM region. The atomic coordinates of the
atoms involved in the reaction were restrained by a harmonic
umbrella potential of 50 kcal·mol
−1
·Å
2
. For the hybrid QM/
MM calculations, the atoms of the PET, a water molecule, and
the side chains of Ser134 and His211 residues were selected to
be treated by QM using a semiempirical AM1/d-PhoT
31
Hamiltonian. The other atoms of the system, protein, and
water molecules were described using the CHARMM/TIP3P
35
force fields, respectively. The number of QM atoms then
resulted in 44, while the final system contains 32,428 atoms,
respectively. It is important to note that the QM region
(Scheme 2) used in this work includes a smaller number of
residues than in previous computational studies.
19,20
The
simulation with a small QM region is computationally less
demanding, and the size of the QM region may have little
influence on the single-point QM/MM calculations for studies
involving enzymatic catalysis.
36,37
Initially, QM/MM Langevin-Verlet MD at 300 K and in a
canonical thermodynamic ensemble (NVT) were used to
equilibrate the system. Due to the number of degrees of
freedom, any residue 20 Å apart from any of the reactants’
atoms was selected to be frozen in the remaining calculations.
Cut-offs for the nonbonding interactions were applied using a
switching scheme within a range radius of 14.5 to 16.0 Å.
Afterward, the system was equilibrated by means of 2.0 ns of
QM/MM MD at a temperature of 300 K. The computed
RMSD for the protein during the last 1 ns renders a value
always below 0.9 Å. Furthermore, the temperature RMS along
the different equilibration steps was always lower than 2.5 K,
and the potential energy variation coefficient during the
dynamics simulations was never higher than 0.3%.
A total of 40 simulations were performed at different values
of the R1-R2 antisymmetric combination of distances (ranging
from −2.0 to 2.0 Å, see Scheme 3), with an umbrella force
constant of 50 kcal.mol

reaction coordinate. In addition, 40 simulations were
performed at different values of R3 (ranging from 1.0 to 3.0

quently, 1600 simulation windows were needed to obtain the
2D-PMF for Step 1 of the PET degradation mechanism of
IsPETase (Scheme 3). R1-R2 described the proton transfer
from Ser134 to His211, and R3 described the nucleophilic
attack of Ser134 on the C
4
1
of PET. The same protocol was
used for Step 2, where the antisymmetric combination of
distances R2-R4 and the distance R5 was used to describe,
respectively, the proton transfer from His211 to the oxygen O
y
of PET and the PET C

bond breakdown. For Step 3, the
antisymmetric combination of distances R6-R7 and the
distance R8 was used to describe, respectively, the proton
transfer from water to histidine and the nucleophilic attack of
water on the C
4
1
of PET. For Step 4, the antisymmetric
combination of distances R7-R9 and the distance R3 were used
to describe, respectively, the proton transfer from His211 to
Ser134 and the C
4
1
-O
Ser134
bond breakdown. The values of the
variables sampled during the simulations were then pieced
together to construct a full distribution function, from which
the 2D-PMF was obtained. In each window, 20 ps of relaxation
were followed by 20 ps of production with a time step of 0.5 fs
due to the nature of the chemical step involving a hydrogen
transfer. The Verlet algorithm was used to update the
velocities. It is important to note that the coordinates
considered in the PMF are described in Scheme 3. The
transition states were identified as saddle points (see
Supporting Information (SI)).
Since the use of QM/MM calculations in the evaluation of
free energy is commonly restricted to semiempirical Hamil-
tonians due to the large number of gradient vector evaluations,
we initiated our analysis with a semiempirical potential. Then,
the error associated with this quantum level of theory was
reduced by including correction terms. The corrections were
applied by subtracting the energy calculated for the QM region
using a semiempirical level and adding the energy from the
DFT potential.
38
The QM region was described with the M06-
2X
38
functional with the 6-31+G(d,p) basis set. The TS-like
conformations obtained from AM1/d-PhoT/MM MD simu-
lations were used as the starting geometries for the correction
energy at the DFT level. The QM corrections were performed
using the ORCA 5.0.3 quantum chemistry program suite
39
and
the pDynamo program.
26
The same high-level QM corrections
have been applied previously.
40
Per-residue Interaction Energy Calculations. Further-
more, we investigated how active site residues stabilize or
destabilize the species present along the free energy profile,
analyzing the interaction energy of each protein residue with
the ligand (TS and RS). There are different ways of exploring
interaction energy per residue using the QM/MM approach.
For instance, Quantum Mechanics-Poisson−Boltzmann Sur-
face Area (QM-PBSA).
41
While insightful, the computational
demands posed significant challenges for larger sampling
endeavors and for exploring the energy interaction between the
protein and different species along the reaction path. Other
strategies employed QM/MM calculations to elucidate the
interactions between proteins and ligands through the
Interacting Quantum Atoms approach.
42
Despite offering
novel insights into utilizing QM and QM/MM calculations
for analyzing energy contributions to protein structure and
binding, these methods often overlook transition state
structures and the roles of specific residues in each step of
chemical reactions. Here, we have made use of a hybrid M06-
2X/CHARMM36m method based on a semiclassical approach
to obtain the interaction energy between the substrates and
transition states, obtained from the mechanism and the
environment. This interaction energy is evaluated as the
difference between the QM/MM energy and the energies of
the separated, noninteracting QM and MM subsystems with
the same geometry. Considering that the MM part is described
using a nonpolarizable potential, the interaction energy
contribution of each residue of the protein is given by the
following expression:

This interaction energy can be exactly decomposed into a
sum over residues, provided that the polarized wave function
(Ψ) is employed to evaluate this energy contribution. It is
important to point out that although the structures used to
calculate the per-residue energy contribution were obtained
from the reaction coordinates describing the mechanism, the
QM region used in the decomposition analysis was the whole
PET molecule (98 atoms) for TS1 and RS and the PET
molecule and water (101 atoms), without His211 and Ser134
in the QM region. The same strategy has been used in previous
contributions.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Free Energy Surface for Exploring Reaction Paths for
PET Hydrolysis. IsPETase, which belongs to the serine
hydrolase family, shares a similar molecular mechanism with
cutinases,
45
involving the formation of an acyl-enzyme
intermediate in the first step and a nucleophilic attack by a
water molecule in the second step.
16
The PET hydrolysis
mechanism was investigated using ONIOM calculations in
previous computational studies.
45,46
Despite the limitations of
ONIOM calculations, such as the inability to account for the
dynamic behavior of the enzyme, it is possible to reasonably
estimate the activation barrier associated with each step of the
molecular mechanism. The potential energy surfaces obtained
using QM/MM potentials can also be used to explore
enzymatic mechanisms, albeit with the same limitations as
ONIOM calculations.
48
Note that Determining the activation
energy of the reaction catalyzed by IsPETase would be
extremely resource-intensive when using free energy surfaces
acquired through umbrella sampling at the DFT/MM
potential. Therefore, we used QM/MM and molecular
dynamics simulations with the semiempirical potential AM1/
d-PhoT
31
to describe the QM region. This semiempirical
potential is parametrized to reproduce high-level density-
functional results and have been used for study different
enzymatic reaction mechanisms.
32−34
Understanding the catalytic mechanism of IsPETase and
investigating the impact of key mutations in this enzyme are
crucial steps for enhancing enzymatic catalysis. It is worth
noting that examining the effects of proposed mutations on the
activation energy of the reaction catalyzed by IsPETase would
be extremely resource-intensive when using free energy
surfaces acquired through umbrella sampling at the DFT/
MM potential, even for a small QM region. In simpler terms,
the computational expenses tied to assessing free energy
surfaces in proteins make it challenging to derive dependable
surfaces for enzymatic reactions with both a sufficiently high ab
initio level and adequate sampling. One alternative for
analyzing the influence of mutations on the activation energy
of the reaction catalyzed by IsPETase could involve the
application of Empirical Valence Bond (EVB) methods,
49
which is a simple and useful tool for obtaining activation
energy in a protein environment. On the other hand, this
approach requires a well-calibrated EVB surface in solution.
Our goals were to compute the activation energy for the
reaction catalyzed by IsPETase and compare it with
experimental data and previous QM/MM simulation re-
sults.
14,17−21
The combination of experimental
7,9
and compu-
tational data offers a comprehensive understanding of the
enzyme’s functions, and the identification of specific amino
acid residues that contribute to the stabilization or
destabilization of the transition states can reveal potential
targeted mutations for enhanced enzyme activity. Here, we
initiated our analysis with the Potential of Mean Force (PMF)
using QM/MM potential for exploring the acylation step
Figure 1. Free energy surface (FES) at AM1/d-PhoT/MM potential for mechanism of reaction involving IsPETase. The acylation is described by
two steps: (a) Step 1, where the formation of tetrahedral intermediate (TI1) is observed, and (b) Step 2, where the formation of MHET (INT2) is
observed. Contour interval of 2 kcal/mol.

(Figure 1). The FES results provide a more detailed picture of
the reaction mechanism, including a dynamic description of
the enzymatic environment. To generate the FES, we applied
the AM1/d-PhoT
31
Hamiltonian to describe the QM region
(Scheme 2) during QM/MM MD simulations, which lacks
accuracy compared to ab initio and DFT calculations, but it is
fast enough to simulate QM/MM molecular dynamics
simulation and obtain a proper sampling.
Figure 1 shows the FES used to describe the first step of
PET degradation. This FES describes the acylation step, where

R1, R2, and R3 were used as distinguished reaction
coordinates for describing the chemical reaction. R1-R2
correspond to the proton transfer from Ser134-OG to
His211-NE1. Note that OG is the hydroxyl group of Ser134,
and NE1 is the N of imidazole in the His211 residue. R3
corresponds to the attack of Ser134-OG on the ester carbon
atom of the first subunit of the tetramer, which represents the
PET polymer in our simulations. Here, this carbon atom was
labeled as C
4
1
, as proposed by reference.
20
The resulting FES obtained with AM1/d-PhoT/MM
renders two possible paths for the formation of the tetrahedral
intermediate (TI). Path 1 occurs through TS1 formation
(Figure 1a). The free energy of activation associated with this
path corresponds to 13.8 kcal/mol (see Figure 2). In TS1, the
average distance between Ser134-OG and the carbon atom
(C
4
1
) corresponds to 1.6 Å, aligning with the value of 1.5 Å
obtained from FES using DFT/MM as potential.
20
The
average distance between the proton of Ser134-OG and
His211-NE1 is 1.8 Å, with the proton located closer to Ser134
(1.1 Å) (Figure 3a and Table S1), which indicates that this
proton transfer is in an earlier stage of the process.
Path 2 (Figure 1a) occurs in a stepwise mechanism through
TS1′ and TS2′ formation. The free energy of activation
associated with this path corresponds to 12.4 and 6.3 kcal/mol
for the first and second steps, respectively (see Figure 2). In
the TS1′, the average distance between Ser134-OG and the
carbon atom (C
4
1
) corresponds to 2.98 Å, and the average
distance between the proton of Ser134-OG and His211-NE1 is
1.1 Å, with the proton located closer to His211 (Figure 3b and
Table S2). This result indicates a very advanced stage for
proton transfer and suggests that the nucleophilic attack of
Ser134 on the carbon atom (C
4
1
) may occur after the
deprotonation of Ser134 by His211. Path 2 agrees with
IsPETase’s recently proposed mechanism for the acylation step
of PET degradation.
20
In the TS2′, the average distance
between Ser134-OG and the carbon atom (C
4
1
) corresponds
to 2.3 Å (Figure 3b and Table S2). The product of this step is
the tetrahedral intermediate (TI1 on Figure 1). It is worth
noting that previous work has also suggested that the
formation of tetrahedral intermediate in the acylation stage
may occur through a stepwise path.
46
Figure 4 shows the formation of an acyl-enzyme
intermediate (INT2). There are also two possible paths on
the FES to form this intermediate. Path 1 occurs through TS2.
In the TS2, the R5 corresponds to 1.6 Å (see Figure 4a and
Table S1). These coordinates represent the average distance
between O
γ
and the carbon atom (C
4
1
), which is associated
with the breaking of the ester bond of the PET (Figure 4a).
The proton transfer from His211-NE1 to O
γ
of PET is
represented by the R2-R4 distances. In TS2, R4 corresponds to
Figure 4. Representative structures along the 2D-PMF obtained from the QM/MM free-energy simulations for Step 2 acylation PET breakdown:

1.1 Å (see Scheme 3, Table S1), indicating that proton transfer
from His211-NE1 to O
γ
of PET occurs first, then the cleavage
of the ester bond of the PET takes place. This result shows
another alternative mechanism to the previously described
work for PET degradation by IsPETase,
20
where first the
proton transfer from His211 to PET occurs, and then PET
cleavage takes place. The free energy of activation obtained at
the AM1/d-PhoT/MM level corresponds to 13.8 kcal/mol for
path 1 (Figure 2).
Path 2 is in accordance with the mechanism of PET
degradation by IsPETase described in the previous contribu-
tion.
20
In TS3′, the R5 corresponds to 1.8 Å and R2 is 1.0 Å
(see Figure 4b and Table S2). These results show the advanced
stage of the breaking of the ester bond of the PET in TS3′,
while the proton remains connected to His211-NE1. The
INT2 corresponds to the acyl-enzyme intermediate (Figures
1b and 4b). The path with lower barrier for reaction is through
TS3′ with a free energy activation of 11.5 kcal/mol. In this
step, there is the formation of an acetyl-enzyme intermediate
(with Ser134 bonded to MHET), as also proposed in a
previous computational study.
19
Figure 5 shows the FES for deacylation, where a water
molecule of the solvent plays a critical role. In step 3, the
barrier calculated at AM1/d-PhoT/MM potential for path 1 is
8.3 kcal/mol. In TS3, the distance between the water oxygen
and C
4
1
is 1.6 Å, while the R6 and R7 distances describing the
proton transfer from water to His211 are 1.1 and 1.8 Å,
respectively (Figure 6a and Table S3). The product on the free
energy surface (Figure 5a) step corresponds to the tetrahedral
intermediate 2 (TI2). The transition states for TI2 formation
identified using AM1/d-PhoT/MM potential are similar to the
ones found in previous studies.
45,46,47
Path 2 occurs in a
stepwise mechanism through TS5′ and TS6′ formation, with
activation free energy of 10.3 and 3.6 kcal/mol, respectively
(see Figure 2). In the TS5′, the average distance between the
water molecule and carbon atom (C
4
1
) corresponds to 2.9 Å,
and the average distance between the proton of water and its
oxygen is 1.8 Å, with the proton located closer to His211-NE1
(1.0 Å) (Figure 6b and Table S4). In TS6′, the average
distance between the oxygen of the formed hydroxyl group and
the carbon atom (C
4
1
) corresponds to 2.2 Å. In the next step,
the proton transfer from His211-NE1 to O
γ
of MHET,
represented by R7-R9, is associated with the breaking of the
TI2 (R3 coordinate) (Figure 6b and Table S4).
On FES, the TI2 (tetrahedral intermediate 2) is at a clear
minimum (see Figure 5). In TS4, the R3, R7, and R9
correspond to 1.7, 1.1, and 1.7 Å, which indicates the advanced
stage of the proton transfer and the beginning of breaking the
O
γ
-C
4
bond of acylated Ser134 (Figure 7a). Path 1, as depicted
in Figure 5a, outlines a concerted and asynchronous
mechanism for this step, consistent with prior computational
contributions.
20
Path 2 leads to the formation of INT4′, where
first occurs the O
γ
-C
4
bond break of acylated Ser134, and then
the proton transfer from His211 to INT4′ takes place (Figure
7b). Interestingly, the barriers of reaction for Path 1 and Path 2
are 16.1 and 16.4 kcal/mol, respectively. Therefore, based on
these results, both paths are feasible.
The PS on this FES (Figure 5) corresponds to the reaction
product, MHET. It is important to note that, according to our
results, MHET is formed in the deacylation step. Initially, this
may seem divergent from the result obtained in reference,
20
where an MHET leaving group is observed in the acylation
step. However, a thorough analysis of the system reveals that
MHET formation may occur in both steps, depending on the
polymer size used in simulations and the choice of ester carbon
for nucleophilic attack. In our case, we used a PET tetramer,
while reference
20
used a PET dimer. This observation aligns
with previous contributions, which highlight that the ester
bond of the polymer is attacked by serine in the active site of
PETase, forming a tetrahedral intermediate. Subsequently, the

first product of the reaction is MHET or a fragment of the
polymer, depending on the length of the initial polymeric chain
and the site of cleavage. Then, an acyl-enzyme intermediate is
generated.
19
Therefore, the QM/MM with a reduced QM size
and AM1/d-PhoT/MM potential describes the mechanism
steps in agreement with experimental data.
The estimated experimental activation free energy for PET
degradation (using transition state theory to obtain activation
free energy from experimental turnover rate) is 18.0 kcal/
mol.
7,9
The uncertainty associated with this experimental value
is less than 1 kcal/mol, considering the potential variability in
the experimental conditions and measurement precision. We
have determined that the reaction barriers for the last step of
deacylation are 16.1 and 16.4 kcal/mol for paths 1 and 2,
respectively (see Figures 2 and 5). For acylation, we have
found barriers involved in the mechanism to be below 13.8
kcal/mol, in agreement with reference.
21
In general, according
to our results of the energy difference between the TS and its
preceding intermediate (Figure 3), deacylation is the rate-
limiting step of the process. Interestingly, Knott et al. have
proposed that the deacylation step is the rate-limiting step in
MHETase’s breakdown of an MHET molecule.
21
Additionally,
cutinase QM/MM simulations for PET biotransformation
processes revealed that deacylation is the rate-limiting step of
PET degradation.
50
These results diverge from the observa-
tions reported in references
19
and.
20
On the other hand,
considering the energy difference between each TS and RS
(Figure 3), the acylation step can be regarded as the rate-
limiting step in the PET degradation reaction by IsPETase.
This step has a barrier of 13.2 kcal/mol (stepwise) or 13.8
kcal/mol (concerted), consistent with reference,
19
which
describes the reaction mechanism of PET hydrolysis by
PETase and LCC enzymes using QM/MM MD simulations,
finding a barrier of 14.6 kcal/mol for the deacylation step. Our
results also align with Reference,
20
which offers an atomistic
and thermodynamic interpretation of the catalytic mechanism
of PETase using umbrella sampling simulations at the PBE/
MM MD level with a large QM region. This study details a
two-stage reaction mechanism (acylation and deacylation),
with the deacylation step having a free energy barrier of 15.1
kcal/mol.
Energy Corrections. In general, the AM1/d-PhoT/MM
potential described the species along the reaction profile,
consistent with previous computational contributions. Accord-
ing to experimental data for PET degradation, the activation
free energies are approximately 18 kcal/mol.

and deacylation, respectively. It is important to emphasize that
we used a semiempirical Hamiltonian to model the quantum
mechanics (QM) region. While this approach enables the
simulation of free energy profiles in a timely manner, it is less
accurate compared to ab initio and density functional theory
(DFT) methods. Indeed, the semiempirical potential used to
describe the QM region underestimates activation barriers
compared to DFT for the acylation step. However, for
deacylation, we observed remarkable agreement, with a
deviation of only 1 kcal/mol from the reference.
20
In order to correct the energies obtained with semiempirical
potential, we applied corrections to the minimum free energy

path by subtracting the energy calculated for the QM region
using the semiempirical level and adding the energy from the
M06-2X/6-31+G(d,p) level (Figure 8). The results reveal that
acylation and deacylation take place in a stepwise manner,
which is in remarkable agreement with previous computational
contribution,
19
where Path 2 for both acylation and
deacylation presents the lower barrier for MHET formation
(Figure 8). Energies calculated at M06-2X/6-31+G(d,p)/MM
level showed that path 2 (Figure 8) describing the proton
transfer from His211-NE1 to O
γ
of PET has the lowest ΔG
‡
value (2.9 kcal/mol), which suggests that it is the most
energetically favorable step in the reaction under standard
conditions. Also, the lowest ΔG value is seen in path 2 during
PET breakdown (−12.5 kcal/mol), indicating that it is the
most energetically favorable step under actual reaction
conditions. Step 3 has the highest ΔG value (3.3 kcal/mol),
suggesting that it is the least energetically favorable step under
actual reaction conditions. Step 4 has the highest ΔG
‡
value
(27.9 kcal/mol for the concerted path and 20.4 kcal/mol in the
first step of the stepwise path), which indicates that it is the
least energetically favorable step under standard conditions.
Overall, the rate-limiting step was found to be deacylation with
a barrier of 20.4 kcal/mol, which is in agreement with the
computational value of 19.8 kcal/mol.
21
It is worth noting that,
considering the energy difference between the TS and RS
calculated at the M06-2X/6-31+G(d,p)/MM level for MHET
formation, the deacylation step is also the rate-limiting step in
the reaction involving PET and IsPETase (see Figure 8).
Per-residue Interaction Energy. Here, we employed
residual decomposition analysis to explore the contributions of
individual molecular components to the overall electrostatic
interaction energy between PET tetramer and IsPETase at the
reactants (RS) and transition states (TS) (Figure 8). This
approach yields insights into the specific residues that can
either stabilize or destabilize the TS.
Positive values indicate energy contributions with repulsive
interactions with the transition state, whereas negative values
suggest contributions favoring stabilization. Upon analysis of
these results, in the first step of acylation, several residues
display notable effects on the TS1. The residues Tyr61, Asp92,
Arg97, Ser134, Met135, Ala157, Trp159, Glu178, Gly208,
His211, Cys213, Gln221, Asn220, Thr253, and Arg254 show
significant energy contributions, either stabilizing or destabiliz-
ing the transition state (Figure 9a). These residues play a
crucial role in catalysis or structural stabilization during the
enzymatic reaction between PET and IsPETase.
We highlight the residues located between 200 and 230
positions in IsPETase with large positive energies, such as
Gly208, Ser212, Cys213, Ala214, Asn215, and Gln221 (Figure
9c). These residues might represent key positions for structural
modifications or targeted mutations to reduce the reaction
barrier during this step and enhance the enzyme’s efficiency or
selectivity in the catalytic process. For the last step of the
reaction, in the TI2 breakdown and therefore MHET release,
the residues Arg64, Ser66, Arg97, Trp133, Ser134, Asp160,
Glu178, Gly208, Cys213, Asn215, Asn218, Asn220, and
Gln221 show significant energy contributions, either stabilizing
or destabilizing the transition state (Figure 9c). The high
energy contribution of Ser134 is related to its covalent bond
with the substrate. Again, a cluster of residues with high

interaction can be seen in the region 200 to 230 (Figure 9d),
but differently from Step 1, we have seen a great number of
attractive interactions with residues Gly208, Gly209, His211,
Cys213, Asn215, and Gln221 playing an important role in the
MHET release.
Residues such as Arg254, Tyr61, and Cys213 exemplify the
nuanced interplay of repulsive and attractive contributions in
transition state stabilization. Arg254′s notable decrease in
energy contribution (−260.11 kcal/mol) could reflect a
reduction in electrostatic repulsion during TS1 formation,
which is critical for stabilizing the PET subunit 4 that is located
far away from the active site. This indicates Arg254′s pivotal
role in neutralizing repulsive forces that could help stabilize the
transition state. Similarly, a drastic energy decrease is observed
for Tyr61 (−274.20 kcal/mol), which could be a result of the
coordination of the PET monomer 1, due to the significant
movements required in the first steps of the reaction (Figure
10a). Cys213′s significant energy increase (176.47 kcal/mol)
suggests a shift toward repulsive interactions, likely due to its
role in orienting the substrate as it is strategically positioned
between subunits 3 and 4, thus highlighting its essential
contribution to maintaining a favorable energetic environment
for the transition state. On the other hand, during the
formation of TS4, its role is inverted as the movement of the
end chain of PET is considerably larger than in the first steps
of the mechanism (Figure 10b). Figure 10 depicts the
transition states’ most significant residues, obtained by
decomposition analysis during the PETase acylation and
deacylation steps. These steps are critical because they involve
the formation of a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate and the
release of the product, a key component of the enzyme’s
catalytic mechanism.
In addition to the interactions that define the central role of
the catalytic serine and histidine residues, these findings
highlight the presence of aromatic residues, such as tryptophan
and tyrosine, which stabilize both transition states and provide
a hydrophobic environment suitable for catalysis. However,
their exact contributions may differ, with Trp159 in TS1 and
Trp133 in TS4, indicating subunit-specific interactions with
the substrate. The differences in the electrostatic environment
between TS1 and TS4 provide insight into the fine-tuning
required for each step. TS1, for example, contains Arg97 and
Met135, whose contributions may not be absent in TS4,
implying a distinct electrostatic and structural environment for
the acylation step. In contrast, TS4 has residues such as
Asn220 and Gln221, indicating a unique network of hydrogen
bonds important for the deacylation process.
Electrostatic contributions to PETase TS1 are mostly
concentrated in the first subunit, but in TS4, these
contributions move to the third and fourth subunits. These
differences in the electrostatic interactions during the reaction
could be attributed to the preparation of the PETase for
nucleophilic attack in the first step and the product release in
the final step of the reaction.
The residual decomposition analysis further refines our
understanding of the catalytic mechanism by isolating the
contributions of individual amino acid residues to the total
electrostatic interaction energy. This approach not only aids in
identifying key residues that stabilize or destabilize transition
states and intermediates, but also provides new opportunities
for enzyme engineering by pinpointing targets for mutation or
structural modification. These findings are helpful for creating
enzymes with improved catalytic capabilities, as seen by the
important roles that residues like Tyr61, Ser134, and His211
play in stabilizing transition states. Recent studies have
emphasized the crucial role of noncovalent interactions in
maintaining the three-dimensional structure and function of
proteins.
52
With our decomposition analysis, we could observe
that this flexibility is particularly evident in the acylation step of
PETase, where interactions between Met135, Tyr61, and the
first ring of the PET polymer were crucial for the stabilization
of the oxyanion (Figures 8a and 10a). The interaction
contribution of each residue can be found in Supporting
Information.
Simulation and experimental data are useful for machine
learning methods applied in the discovery and annotation of
promising enzymes, as well as in suggesting beneficial
mutations for improving known targets.
53,54
Indeed, combining
experimental data on mutations and catalysis
55−57
with the
computational interaction energies of different residues and
their contributions to catalysis using machine learning (ML)
algorithms may offer opportunities to design new, more
effective catalytic systems. By analyzing the electrostatic
profiles during catalysis obtained from QM/MM of enzymes
such as PETase, we aim to create a ML model to predict the
electrostatic impacts of mutations to predict beneficial
mutations, optimize enzyme design for improved catalytic
properties, and accelerate the discovery of efficient enzyme
variants. Additionally, it is possible to develop a comprehensive
mutation database from MD simulations and QM/MM

calculations. This integrated approach may accelerate the pace
of enzyme engineering, opening new possibilities for creating
catalytic systems specifically designed to degrade synthetic
polymers like PET.

CONCLUSIONS
We used the QM/MM approach to investigate PET
degradation by IsPETase, providing a detailed analysis of the
energetics involved in the formation of the product mono(2-
hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET). The acylation step
simulations, focusing on the formation of tetrahedral
intermediate 1 (TI1), unveiled two potential paths: a
concerted mechanism through TS1 and a stepwise pathway
via TS1′ and TS2′. The FES results indicated an endergonic
reaction for the formation of TI1, aligning with prior
computational insights. Further exploration into the deacyla-
tion process elucidated the formation of tetrahedral
intermediate 2 (TI2), a critical stage where a water molecule
intervenes in the PET breakdown. Furthermore, residual
decomposition analysis identified specific amino acid residues
that contribute to stabilization or destabilization of the
transition states. Our investigation highlighted that a cluster
of residues, particularly in the 200−230 region, exhibited
markedly positive energy contributions during the acylation,
implying a potential site for structural modifications or targeted
mutations. On the other hand, the same region provided
negative energy contributions during the last step of the
reaction. Overall, the energetic values obtained from our 2D-
PMF for the acylation step using QM/MM potential are
consistent with previous studies. This result can be used for
exploring the mechanism of PET hydrolysis with less
computational cost compared with previous simulations,
which could be an important tool for designing IsPETase
variants if one must explore key mutations that would affect
the activation energy. Understanding the degradation of PET
into its monomeric components is crucial for the engineering
of enzyme systems tailored for PET degradation.
