ABSTRACT
Background: Citalopram is a class of antidepressant drugs that works by increasing the amount of serotonin to 
maintain mental balance. However, the risk of liver damage associated with citalopram use remains an area of ongoing 
research, with several potential mechanisms implicated in its pathogenesis.
Aim: This experimental study aims to evaluation of physiological and histological renal damages due to low and high 
citalopram doses and the ameliorative role of walnuts-pulp extract in reducing hepatotoxic damage. 
Methods: To assess the side effects of citalopram and evaluate the ameliorative effect of Juglans regia pulp extract on 
liver functions, 32 mature male rats were divided into four equal groups: the first group was kept as the control group, 
drench 0.5 ml tab water; the second group was ingested 0.6 mg/kg of citalopram and 10 mg/kg of J. regia pulp extract; 
the third group was ingested 0.6 mg/kg of citalopram and 20 mg/kg of J. regia pulp extract; and the fourth group was 
ingested 0.6 mg/kg of citalopram only (all groups drenched daily for 60 days).
Results: Significant elevation in alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase was observed in all animals 
treated with citalopram with or without J. regia pulp extract, but ALT in animals treated with citalopram with 20 mg/kg 
J. regia extract showed a significant reduction compared with others. The serum bilirubin levels revealed no significant 
differences between the groups of treated animals. Pathohistological sections showed normal histological structures for 
hepatic tissue and sinusoids without any significant occupied lesions in control and animals treated with J. regia pulp 
extract at both doses with citalopram. In tissue sections of rats drenched citalopram, there were fatty degeneration, with 
fibrous network formation, structureless, homogenous, and pinkish material, hepatic vein congestion and narrowing in 
the hepatic artery and arteriole diameter, fat droplet accumulation in the hepatocytes.
Conclusion: Treatments with citalopram caused liver dysfunction and damage in liver tissue, whereas J. regia pulp 
extracts have a protective role against liver tissue at high or low doses.

Introduction
The liver is an important large gland, and it is one of 
the most important organs for life in the human and 
animal body. The liver has many functions that make 
it difficult to count them; therefore, it is important to 
perform all the activities of the body at the level of the 
organs or the level of the body as a whole (Ozougwa 
and Eyo, 2014). The process of controlling the transfer 
of absorbed substances from the digestive system into 
the bloodstream is one of the most important basic 
functions of the liver (Mohajan, 2025). It is considered 
of great importance that it cannot be dispensed with even 
for a very short time, and death occurs as soon as the 
complete removal of the liver (Shojaie et al., 2020). The 
most important liver functions include bile secretion, 
bilirubin metabolism, vascular and hematologic 
functions, detoxification, minerals and vitamin storage, 
and immunologic function, and it has interrelationships 
with other organs (Prince et al., 2020).
Doctors and specialists in the field of biological sciences 
for investigation of liver viability use a test called liver 
function, which is a group of many tests to identify the 
concentrations or activity of some liver products as an 
indicator of the vitality and health of the liver. These 
tests include measuring the concentrations of some 
enzymes that are present in the blood when the liver 
is injured, such as SGOT (Lee, 2009), or measuring 
the concentrations of some substances produced by

the liver and released into the bloodstream, such as 
some types of protein. In addition, the concentrations 
of other substances whose height is considered harmful 
to the body and get rid of through the liver as products 
that break down red blood cells, bilirubin, for example 
(Gowda, 2009). The presence of certain enzymes 
or differences in the concentrations of some of these 
substances indicates a defect in the vitality or health of 
the liver (Ullah et al., 2016). The liver is affected by 
the excessive use of medicines and even some foods 
consumed by humans, which are surplus to the body’s 
needs and are stressful for the liver in the process 
of organizing storage, transfer, or disposal of these 
excess substances, such as fats, alcoholic beverages, 
and others (Chen et al., 2015). One of the widely 
used drugs in recent years is antidepressants, which 
are among the drugs that have many adverse effects 
and are dangerous at the same time (Stroup and Gray, 
2018). Some of these damages are known and proven, 
and perhaps there are many adverse reactions that are 
not yet known.
This study aims to find out if there is damage caused by 
antidepressant drugs (citalopram) on the liver level. On 
the other hand, the use of Juglans regia pulp is widely 
used to determine whether the extract plays a role in 
reducing or limiting the adverse effects of citalopram.
Materials and Methods
Study animals
In total, 28 male rats of 118–159 g of weight were 
purchased from a private animal house in Baghdad 
province (Iraq) and transported to the Animal House 
in the College of Science at the University of Wasit. 
Initially, the study animals were subjected to a 
preparation period of 1 week, during which they were 
fed a pellet, presented to tap water, and exposed to 
12/12 hours of light/dark.
Extract preparation
An overall 1,000 m of walnuts-pulp were purchased 
from a local supermarket, ground using an electron 
mill, and transported to a Soxhlet extractor. The extract 
was obtained using ethanol (70%) for 72 hours at room 
temperature, and then, the extract was then filtered 
using a filter paper, and the ethanol was removed using 
a rotary evaporator at 55°C. The obtained crude extract 
was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide, and the mixture 
was kept at −20°C until use. 
Experimental design
Thirty-two albino male rats were divided randomly into 
four equal groups in plastic cages and incubated in the 
Animal House in the College of Science (University of 
Wasit) for 2 weeks for adaptation. The experiment was 
started by drenching the animals for 60 days as follows: 
The first group was drenched with 0.5 ml of tap water, 
which was kept as a control. 
The Second group received 0.6 mg/kg citalopram. 
The third group drenched 0.6 mg/kg citalopram with 
10 mg/kg J. regia pulp extract. 
The fourth drenched 0.6 mg/kg citalopram with 20 mg/
kg J. regia pulp extract. 
Blood sampling
To determine the concentration of blood urea and 
creatinine on day 1, 1 ml of venous blood was 
collected from the tail of each animal into labeled free-
anticoagulant glass-gel tubes to be centrifuged at 5,000 
rpm for 15 minutes. The obtained sera were transferred 
into labeled Eppendorf tubes that were frozen at 
−20°C until be used. On day 60 of experiment, all 
study animals were anesthetized with chloroform 
and subjected to direct collection of blood from the 
heart using a disposable syringe into labeled free-
anticoagulant glass-gel tubes to be centrifuged at 5,000 
rpm for 15 minutes. The obtained sera were transferred 
into labeled Eppendorf tubes that were frozen at −20°C 
until used. 
Liver tissue collection
After anesthetizing the study rats at the end of the 
experiment, the kidneys of each animal were collected 
into labeled plastic containers and fixed in neutral 
buffered formalin (10%).
Biochemical measurements of liver enzymes and 
bilirubin levels
According to the manufacturer’s instructions for 
quantitative ELISA kits (SunLong Biotech, China), 
serum samples and the contents of each kit were 
prepared and processed, and the optical density (OD) 
was measured at 450 nm using a microplate ELISA 
reader. Then, the concentrations of alanine transaminase 
(ALT), aspartate transaminase (AST), and bilirubin in 
the tested samples were quantified based on the ODs 
and concentrations of Standards as well as the ODs of 
samples (Gharban and Yousif, 2020; Al-Eodawee et 
al., 2024).
Histology
According to a previously described protocol, the fresh 
tissue sections were dehydrated, cleared, infiltrated, 
paraffin-embedded, sectioned using a microtome, 
mounted on glass slides, stained with Hematoxylin and 
Eosin, and visualized using a light microscope (Hussen 
et al., 2024). 
Statistical analysis
Two-way ANOV A in GraphPad Prism Software was 
performed to calculate significant differences between 
the values of the four study groups at various periods at 
p < 0.05. Data were presented as mean ± standard error 
(Wahab et al., 2024). 
Ethical approval
This study was conducted under the license of the 
College of Science (University of Wasit) during April-
June (2021) under license No. 348/21-2-2021.
Results
The results of this study revealed no significant 
differences in bilirubin levels in all treated animals 
(Table 1), whereas serum ALT and AST levels showed 
significant elevations in all treated animals either by

citalopram alone (fourth group) or with J. regia pulp 
extract at doses of both 10 and 20 mg/kg (Tables 2 and 
3). Sections of histopathological study appeared as 
mild degenerative lesions characterized by infiltration 
of fat droplets inside hepatic cells, which gave them 
a ring shape appearance due to pushing the nucleus at 
one side from the hepatic cells with fibrous networks 
formation in the tissue parenchyma, infiltration of 
structureless, homogenous, and pinkish material (Figs. 
1–6). Clear hepatic vein congestion and narrowing in 
the hepatic artery and arteriole diameters revealed 
that citalopram caused liver dysfunction and injury 
(Figs. 7–9). 
Discussion
These results correspond with those of other studies, in 
which patients treated with antidepressants appeared to 
have moderately elevated levels of the aminotransferase. 
All antidepressants caused hepatotoxicity; citalopram 
is that have the least potential for hepatotoxicity, which 
is characterized by high alanine aminotransferase levels 
(Gartlehner et al., 2008; V oican et al., 2014; Ilgın et al., 
2020). The results of this study revealed no significant 
differences in bilirubin levels in all treated animals 
as the level of p < 0.05, serum ALT and AST levels 
showed a significant elevation in all treated animals 
either by citalopram only (fourth group) or with J. 
regia pulp extract at doses of 10 and 20 mg/kg B.W. 
Sections of histopathological sections show mild 
degenerative lesions characterized by infiltration of 
fat droplets inside hepatic cells, which give them a 
ring shape appearance due to pushing the nucleus at 
one side from the hepatic cells with fibrous networks 
formation in the tissue parenchyma, infiltration of 
structureless, homogenous, and pinkish material (Figs. 
4 and 6). Clear hepatic vein congestion and narrowing 
in the hepatic artery and arteriole diameters revealed 
that citalopram caused liver dysfunction and injury 
(Figs. 7–9). 
The liver has large quantities of metabolizing enzymes 
as well as the largest blood supply; therefore, it is 
exposed to the harmful effects of most drugs (Patel 
and Patel, 2023). Some antidepressants can inhibit or 
induce cytochrome P450  activity, thus affecting the 
serum levels of antidepressants or their metabolites 
and thereby potentially increasing the risk of hepatic 
toxicity and, to a lesser extent, for selective serotonin 
reuptake inhibitors, including fluvoxamine, paroxetine, 
and citalopram (Edinoff et al., 2021; Luong et al., 
2022). Therefore, abnormal liver function test results 
in antidepressant-treated patients should be interpreted 
with caution. The pathological mechanism of liver 
damage associated with antidepressant use is metabolic 
or immunoallergic. In most cases, the onset of drug-
induced liver injury is extended from several days to 
6 months after antidepressant treatment (V oican et al., 
2014). 
Antidepressants and antipsychotics have the ability 
to cause hepatotoxicity even at medical doses. Drug-
induced liver injury caused by antidepressants and 
antipsychotics may occur through multiple molecular 
mechanisms, including unwanted drug side effects 
or its metabolites, liver oxidative stress, steatosis, 
and inflammation (Todorović Vukotić et al., 2021). 
An elevation of serum ALT, AST, and TSB levels 
is a biomarker of liver injury due to citalopram 
administration. 
According to the findings of the histopathological study, 
necrosis in liver cells, asymmetry of nuclear liver cells, 
and disarrangement of hepatocytes were observed in the 
animals treated with 10 mg/kg citalopram as reported 
by another researcher (Ilgın et al., 2020). The study also 
found that citalopram caused liver tissue injury, such as 
necrosis, fatty infiltration, and blood vessel congestion. 
Citalopram is one of the drugs that induce liver injury, 
as mentioned above; central nervous system drugs are 
among the most common drugs that cause liver injury 
(Jiang et al., 2024). The elevation of TSB, AST, and 
ALT levels in addition to morphological changes in the 
hepatocyte parenchyma was considered indicator of 
liver injury following treatment with citalopram in rats. 
Mild necrosis and disarrangement of hepatic cords in 
animals treated by citalopram. Hepatotoxicity findings 
associated with citalopram administration (Ahmadian

et al., 2017). Therefore, the role of J. regia pulp extract 
in protecting the liver tissue was clarified according to 
our results.
There are five hypotheses to explain the negative effect 
of some drugs that cause liver damage, including 
drug interactions, drug metabolism, the hapten theory, 
inflammation, and the danger hypothesis (Andrade 
et al., 2019). Other researchers attribute the reason 
for hepatotoxicity that occurs with many drugs to the 
impairment of the liver structure and liver function, 
such as dysfunction of mitochondria, production of 
metabolites that cause hepatocellular structure and 
function, production of a reactive drug metabolite that 
binds with liver proteins to produce new antigenic 
drug–protein adducts which are targeted by hosts’ 
defenses, and initiation of a systemic hypersensitivity 
response that damages the liver (Andrade et al., 2019; 
Todorović Vukotić et al., 2021)
Many researchers attribute the health role of walnuts 
to the fact that they contain high levels of chemical 
compounds, have high antioxidant content, and are 
a good source of vitamin E and essential fatty acids 
(Zheng et al., 2020; Binici et al., 2021; Elouafy et 
al., 2022). Juglans regia extract has ellagic acid that 
is considered anti-inflammatory which is recorded 
in endothelial aorta, and they also have osteoblastic 
activity in the cell line KS483 (Jahanban-Esfahlan et 
al., 2019). Walnuts are an important source of vitamin 
E and essential fatty acids (Polat et al., 2023). 
Prevention of oxidative stress and oxidation of 
biological macromolecules reduces the risk factors of 
cardiovascular diseases and degeneration (Senoner, 
and Dichtl, 2019; Dubois-Deruy et al., 2020; Izzo et al., 
2021). The scavenging activity of phenolic materials 
against free radicals, in addition to anti-cancer activities, 
has been recorded by many researchers (Matulja et al., 
2022; Suryani et al., 2022).
Conclusion
This study investigated the adverse effects of 
citalopram and the role of the crude ethanol extract of 
J. regia pulp in the enhancement of liver function in 
male rats. In conclusion, treatments with citalopram 
caused liver dysfunction at a dose of 0.6 mg/kg and 
liver tissue damage; whereas, J. regia pulp extracts 
have a protective role against liver tissue damage 
caused by citalopram at high and low doses.
