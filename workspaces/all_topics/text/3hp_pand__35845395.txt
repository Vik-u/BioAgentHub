The recent decline of the international biodiesel industry has led to decreased production
and therefore increased the price of glycerol, which is a major by-product of biodiesel but a
substrate for production of 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP), that is, glycerol as a feedstock
has no advantage over glucose in price. Hence, we engineered glucose to the glycerol
pathway and improved 3-HP production by CRISPR interference (CRISPRi). To begin with,
we cloned the genes encoding glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gpd1) and glycerol
3-phosphatase (gpp2) fromSaccharomyces cerevisiae, which jointly catalyze glucose into
glycerol. The genesgpd1 and gpp2 were co-expressed inK. pneumoniaewith the dCas9
gene integrated in genome, and this recombinant strain produced 2 g/L glycerol in the
shake ﬂask. To minimize the glucose consumption by competing pathways including the
EMP pathway, glycerol oxidation pathway, and by-products pathways, we developed an
CRISPRi system in aforementioned recombinant K. pneumoniae strain to inhibit the
expression of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene (gapA) and 2,3-
butanediol production gene (budA), resulting in a bi-functional strain harboring both
glucose-to-glycerol pathway and CRISPRi system. Reverse transcription and
quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) results showed that this engineered CRISPRi system
transcriptionally inhibited gapA and budA by 82% and 24%, respectively. In shake
ﬂask cultivation, this bi-functional strain produced 2.8 g/L glycerol using glucose as the
carbon source, which was 46.6% increase compared to the strain without the engineered
CRISPRi system. Moreover, this bi-functional strain produced 0.78 g/L 3-HP using
glucose as the sole carbon source. In fed-batch cultivation, this bi-functional strain
produced 1.77 g/L 3-HP. This study provides insights for co-utilization of distinct
carbon sources.

INTRODUCTION
As an isomer of lactic acid, 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is
chemically active (de Fouchecour et al., 2018; Matsakas et al.,
2018). As such, 3-HP is a versatile platform compound from
which a variety of economically important chemicals can be
derived. Currently, industrial production of 3-HP relies mainly
on chemical synthesis (Della Pina et al., 2011). However, chemical
synthesis not only relies on non-renewable resources but also
leads to excessive by-products and severe environmental
pollution (Della Pina et al., 2011). In recent years, microbial
fermentation has emerged as an alternative to chemical synthesis.
For instance, 3-HP can be produced by diverse wild-type or
engineered strains, includingEscherichia coli (Mohan Raj et al.,
2009), S. cerevisiae (Semkiv et al., 2017 ), Corynebacterium
glutamicum (Chen et al., 2017 ), Lactobacillus reuteri (Luo
et al., 2011 ), and K. pneumoniae (Li et al., 2016 ). In
aforementioned host microbes, 3-HP biosynthesis can be
roughly divided into three types: glycerol-based (Kumar and
Park, 2018), glucose-based (Straathof et al., 2005), and acetate-
based 3-HP pathways (Zhao and Tian, 2021). The glycerol-based
3-HP synthesis involves coenzyme A-dependent pathway and
coenzyme A-independent pathway (Jers et al., 2019). The CoA-
independent 3-HP production from glycerol requires only two-
step catalysis by glycerol dehydrogenase (GDH) (EC 4.2.1.30) and
acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) (EC 1.2.1.3). Therefore,
this 3-HP pathway is of great attractiveness. However, the
ALDHs in wild-type strains show low activity, and only trace
amount of 3-HP can be generated (Raj et al., 2010; Ko et al., 2012).
Fortunately, when thetac promoter was used to express PuuC, an
ALDH native toK. pneumoniae, 3-HP was overproduced from
glycerol (Li et al., 2016; Zhao et al., 2019). To produce 3-HP from
glucose through the CoA-independent pathway, a glucose-to-
glycerol pathway needs to be engineered. To do so, it is necessary
to clone the genes encoding glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase
(GPD1, EC 1.1.1.8) and glycerol 3-phosphatase (GPP2, EC
3.1.3.21) from S. cerevisiae (Zheng et al., 2008). In addition, a
host strain tolerant to glycerol is required. Of candidate host
strains, K. pneumoniae is promising in this regard (Zhao et al.,
2019), as it can efﬁciently metabolize glycerol. Although glycerol
is the most used carbon source for production of 3-HP (Nguyen-
Vo et al., 2018), its price is high due to the recent decline of the
biodiesel industry.
In S. cerevisiae, glucose is catalyzed into glycerol by GPD1 and
GPP2 (Chen et al., 2014; Kildegaard et al., 2016). In wild-type
microbes, glucose conversion to glycerol is rather limited and
high-level production of 3-HP is thus challenging. The reason
behind is that glucose uptake is mainly accomplished by the
phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent glucose uptake system (PTS),
and glycolysis pathway (EMP) consumes a large amount of
glucose (Chen et al., 2017 ). Moreover, in the presence of
glucose, the Crabtree effect inhibits the conversion of glycerol
to 3-HP (Joseph et al., 1981
). When metabolic pathways were
optimized and glucose was used as the carbon source, the
maximum 3-HP titer of engineered E. coli reached 37.6 g/L
(Heo et al., 2019 ). Despite a lot of studies, the low 3-HP
production constrains its commercialization ( Ashok et al.,
2011). Hence, global regulation is required to improve the
conversion rate of glucose to 3-HP.
CRISPR interference (CRISPRi,Figure 1B) is a powerful tool
for modulation of multiple genes ( Qi et al., 2013). In fact,
fermentation titer is a quantitative trait controlled by multiple
genes. The guide RNAs in the CRISPR system can direct dCas9 to
user-deﬁned genetic loci, leading to suppression of single or
multiple genes and alternation of metabolites formation
(Jakounas et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2019; Xu and Qi, 2019). For
instance, lactic acid production can be attenuated by an
engineered CRISPRi system targeting D-lactate dehydrogenase
gene inK. pneumoniae(Wang et al., 2018). Conversely, aconitic
acid production can be improved by an engineered CRISPRi
system that simultaneously targeting pyruvate kinase (PK) in the
glycolytic pathway (EMP pathway) and isocitrate dehydrogenase
(IDH) in the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) pathway in
E. coli(Li et al., 2020). These studies highlight the potential of the
CRISPRi system in allocating metabolicﬂux.
Given aforementioned information, we conjecture that
engineering a glucose-to-glycerol pathway in K. pneumoniae
enables 3-HP production using glucose as carbon source. In
addition, the CRISPRi system might be engineered to
reallocate the metabolic ﬂux toward 3-HP and other
metabolites (Figure 1A). In doing so, based on the previous
work, two genes,gpd1 (GenBank accession No. Z74071.1) and
gpp2 (GenBank accession No. DQ332890.1) were used to
construct the shortest pathway for conversion of glucose to 3-
HP. In addition, the CRISPRi system was developed to regulate
the pathways affecting 3-HP production. To boost glucose
conversion to glycerol, we engineered a CRISPRi system
targeting glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene
(gapA) and α-acetolactate decarboxylase gene (budA). Reverse
transcription and quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) was performed to
examine the expression ofgpd1, gpp2, gapA, and budA. Shake
ﬂask cultivation of the recombinant strains were to determine the
production of glycerol, 3-HP, acetic acid, lactic acid, 1,3-
propanediol (1,3-PDO), and 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO). Fed-
batch cultivation of the strain was to examine the production
of 3-HP.

Construction of Recombinants
To overexpress GPD1 and GPP2 inKP-dCas9, their coding genes
gpd1 (GenBank accession No. Z74071.1) and gpp2 (GenBank
accession No. DQ332890.1) genes were cloned by PCR fromS.
cerevisiaegenome. Next, thegpd1 gene was cloned into ptac-15A at
Noc I/Nde I sites, leading to a vector designated ptac-G1; thegpp2
gene was cloned into ptac-15A atNdeI/NheI sites, leading to a vector
designated ptac-G2. Ligatinggpd1with the tac promoter and the RBS
sequence from ptac-G1 to vector ptac-G2 atNot I/Xho Is i t e sl e dt oa
vector designated ptac-G12 ( Supplementary Figure S2 ).
Transformation of vectors ptac-15A and ptac-G12 into competent
KP-dCas9 cells led to recombinant strains KP-15A and KP-G12,
respectively (Supplementary Table S1). KP-dCas9 was transformed
with the constructed plasmid by electro-transformation (0.2 cm,
2.5 kV, and time duration>0.5 ms).E. coli was transformed with
the constructed plasmid by heat shock. Positive clones were
conﬁrmed by colony PCR and DNA sequencing.
To develop the CRISPRi system in KP-dCas9, the CRISPRi
vectors targetinggapA or budA were constructed by replacement
of the sgRNA sequence in vector plv-sgRNA (Supplementary
Table S1, plv-gapA-1, plv-gapA-2, plv-gapA-3, plv-budA-1, plv-
budA-2, and plv-budA-3). Brieﬂy, two complementary single-
stranded target sequences were chemically synthesized and
annealed to form a 23 bp double-stranded DNA owning
cohesive ends matching the BspQ I-digested vector (Table 1).
Subsequent ligation resulted in desired CRISPRi vectors. For each
gapA or budA, three candidate guide RNAs targeting the different
regions were synthesized to ensure efﬁcient inhibition, and the
sgRNA sequences,tet promoter and an RBS sequence from plv-
vector were cloned into ptac-G12 at Eag I/Bmt I sites
(Supplementary Table S1 , ptac-GS, ptac-GG1, ptac-GG2,
ptac-GG3, ptac-GB1, ptac-GB2, and ptac-GB3). Transforming
vectors ptac-GS, ptac-GG1, ptac-GG2, ptac-GG3, ptac-GB1,
ptac-GB2, and ptac-GB3 into competent KP-dCas9 led to
recombinant strains KP-GS, KP-GG1, KP-GG2, KP-GG3, KP-
GB1, KP-GB2, and KP-GB3, respectively (Supplementary Table
S1). Last, RT-qPCR was conducted to determine the most
inhibited gene. The best-performing gapA
and budA sgRNAs
were cloned using isocaudamersNgoM IV andXma I and then
ligated in tandem. The sgRNA expression cassettes were digested
by Eag I andNgoM IV, while the plasmid was digested byEag I
and Xma I, leading to vector named ptac-GGB. Transforming the
vector ptac-GGB into competent KP-dCas9 led to the
recombinant strain KP-GGB ( Supplementary Table S1 ;
Supplementary Figure S3).
RT-qPCR Analysis of CRISPR Interference
To examine the transcription levels of gpd1, gpp2, gapA, and
budA, RT-qPCR was performed. Brieﬂy, strains including KP-
dCas9, KP-G12, KP-GS, KP-GG1, KP-GG2, KP-GG3, KP-GB1,
KP-GB2, KP-GB3, and KP-GGB were cultivated in medium for
24 h and harvested by centrifugation at 4
°C, 12,000 rpm. Then,
the harvested bacteria were lysed with TRIzol reagent. The RNA
samples were used as template to synthesize cDNAs through
reverse transcription. RT-qPCR was carried out by Applied
Biosystems
™ 7900HT Fast Real-Time PCR System (Thermo
Fisher) with SYBR Green addition. The RT-qPCR data were
analyzed using theΔΔCT method with 16S rRNA as an internal
control. All experiments were performed in triplicate.
Shake Flask and Bioreactor Cultivation
In shakeﬂask cultivation, strains KP-dCas9, KP-15A, KP-GS, KP-
GG1, KP-GB2, and KP-GGB were pre-cultured in 4 ml LB medium
overnight. Next, these strains were independently grown in 250-ml
shake ﬂasks each containing 100 ml 3-HP– producing medium and
8.5 mg chloramphenicol at 37
°Ca n d1 5 0r p m .A f t e r3hc u l t i v a t i o n ,
IPTG at aﬁnal concentration of 0.5 mM was added to induce the
expression ofgpd1 and gpp2. Dehydrated tetracycline (aTc) at aﬁnal
concentration of 2μM was added to induce sgRNA expression.
Fermentation broth was sampled every 3 h to examine cell
growth, glucose consumption, and metabolites formation.
In fed-batch cultivation, the recombinant strain was grown in a
5 L bioreactor (Baoxing, China) containing 3 L fermentation medium
to produce 3-HP. The strain KP-GB2 was pre-cultured in 100 ml of
L Bm e d i u mo v e r n i g h ta t3 7
°C and subsequently inoculated into a
bioreactor, containing antibiotics and IPTG. Air was supplied at
1.5 vvm, and agitation speed was set at 400 rpm. The temperature was
set at 37
°C, and the pH was maintained at 7.0 by adding 5 M NaOH.
A total of 700 ml of 500 g/L glucose solution was added at a rate of
4.5 g/h to maintain cell growth after the glucose in medium was
exhausted. The samples were taken out every 6 h to examine cell
growth, glucose consumption, and metabolites formation.
Analytical Methods
Cell concentrations were measured by using microplate reader at
600 nm with 200μL fermentation broth and 1,800μL ddH
2O
added in a cuvette. To measure metabolites, fermentation broth
was centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 10 min to remove bacteria.
Major metabolites including 3-HP, lactic acid, and acetic acid in
supernatant were analyzed by using the high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan)
equipped with a C
18 column and an SPD-20A UV detector at
210 nm. The column was maintained at 25°C. The mobile phase
was 0.05% phosphoric acid at aﬂow rate of 0.8 ml/min. 1,3-PDO
and 2,3-BDO were analyzed by GC (Persee). Analytically pure
1,3-PDO and 2,3-BDO were used as standard for quantiﬁcation.
Residual glucose concentration was measured by an SBA-40E
biosensor analyzer (Biology Institute of Shandong Academy of

Science, China). A new immobilized enzyme membrane was
installed on the electrode, 500 ml standard buffer was prepared
with ddH2O, and the three-in-one standard solution of SBA was
prepared (three materials mentioned earlier are provided by the
instrument manufacturer). Glucose concentration in the
supernatant was diluted to less than 1 g/L. After 25 μL
standard solution was injected into the sampling port
stabilization instrument with a microinjector, the glucose
content in the sample was measured successively, and each
sample was measured three times. Glycerol concentration was
measured by the glycerin test kit (APPLYGEN Beijing). All
samples were ﬁltered through a 0.22μm membrane ﬁlter.
RESULT
Determination of Plasmids
The genes gpd1 and gpp2 were cloned from S. cerevisiae and
independently subcloned into vector ptac-15A, resulting in
vectors ptac-G1 and ptac-G2, respectively ( Figures 2A– C).
Next, PCR was conducted to obtain ptac-G1 as template,gpd1
fragment, tac promoter, and operon ( Figure 2D ). These
fragments were then inserted into ptac-G2 to construct ptac-
G12 (Figure 2E). The two genesgpd1 and gpp2 were expressed
using respectivetac promoter, and their expression was induced
by IPTG.
Glycerol Production by EngineeredK.
pneumoniae
The recombinantK. pneumoniaestrain was cultured in a shake
ﬂask to verify glycerol production. To construct glucose-to-
glycerol pathway, gpd1 and gpp2 were co-expressed in strain
KP-dCas9, which harbored the engineered CRISPRi system. In
doing so, we constructed a recombinant strain named KP-G12,
and the strains KP-15A and KP-dCas9 were used as controls. RT-
qPCR results showed that the transcription levels ofgpd1 and
gpp2 were signiﬁcantly increased in KP-G12 compared to KP-
dCas9 (Figures 3A,B). In 24 h cultivation, glucose consumption
was slowed down due to the expression of heterologous genes
(Figure 3C), and the strain KP-G12 showed a signiﬁcant decrease
in OD
600 (Figure 3D). The strain containing vector ptac-G12
produced 2 g/L glycerol, with 0.1 g/g yield on glycerol (g of
glucose)
−1. In contrast, no glycerol was produced by strains
KP-dCas9 and KP-15A ( Figure 3E,F), indicating that gpd1
and gpp2 catalyzed glucose into glycerol inK. pneumoniae.
CRISPR Interference System Inhibiting EMP
Downstream Pathway and 2,3-BDO
Production
To optimize the CRISPRi system, we prepared several guide
RNAs named G1, G2, G3, B1, B2, and B3 that target the
different regions of gapA and budA (Supplementary Figures
S1A,B,G). The aforementioned six sgRNAs and one non-target
sgRNA were independently ligated to vector ptac-G12
(Supplementary Figures S1C,D ; Figure 4A). Transforming
these vectors into KP-dCas9 led to recombinant strains KP-
GG1, KP-GG2, KP-GG3, KP-GB1, KP-GB2, KP-GB3, and KP-
GS, respectively. The strain KP-GS was used as the control. RT-
qPCR results showed that compared to KP-GS, the strains KP-
GG1 and KP-GB2 showed signiﬁcant decrease in the expression
of target genes (Figures 4A,B). The gapA gene in strain KP-
GG1was transcriptionally inhibited by 60%, and thebudA gene in

strain KP-GB2 was transcriptionally inhibited by 54%. When
budA-2 was connected in series withgapA-1, gpd1, and gpp2
(Supplementary Figures S1E,F ), the resulting plasmid was
named GGB, and the corresponding recombinant strain was
named KP-GGB. In strain KP-GGB, the inhibitory rates of the

oxygen conditions as compared to the strains KP-GS, KP-dCas9,
and KP-15A. In 24 h cultivation, these engineered strains showed
retarded cell growth and reduced glucose consumption. All
engineered K. pneumoniae strains produced glycerol, but the
difference was not signiﬁcant. For 2,3-BDO production, the strain
KP-15A presented the highest titer (8.39 ± 0.33 g/L), while the
strain KP-GB2 presented the lowest titer (1.185 ± 0.045 g/L). In
addition, the strain KP-GB2 produced the highest 3-HP (0.734 ±
0.032 g/L). Interestingly, no signiﬁcant differences were observed
in the production of acetic acid, lactic acid, and 1,3-PDO in all
strains.
Fed-Batch Cultivation of CRISPR
Interference Strains
Now that the strain co-expressinggpd1 and gpp2 was able to
synthesize glycerol from glucose and the strain KP-GB2 showed
the highest 3-HP level in the shakeﬂask, the strain was then
cultivated in a 5 L bioreactor. Results showed that the strain did
not consume glycerol until 12 h fermentation, at this time the
glucose was exhausted. When glucose was supplemented, the
glycerol level was further improved, indicating that the strain did
not consume glycerol until glucose was exhausted. In addition,
only a small amount of 2,3-BDO was produced in the initial stage
of fermentation. However, in the middle and late stages of
fermentation, 2,3-BDO production was increased presumably
due to the rising pH value of medium and the failure of aTc
induction in an alkaline environment, which hampered the
inhibition of the CRISPRi system on by-product pathways.
Due to the engineered glycerol synthesis pathway, the strain
KP-GB2 produced 1.77 ± 0.04 g/L 3-HP in 72 h, with
productivity of 0.025 g/L/h. This low productivity may be
ascribed to the engineered CRISPRi system and genes gpd1
and gpp2, which imposed a heavy burden on cell growth.
Indeed, the maximum OD
600 was only 12.135 ± 0.005.
DISCUSSION
In this study, the glycerol synthesis pathway was engineered inK.
pneumoniae, and the resulting strain was subjected to CRISPRi-
dependent gene regulation (Figure 2). By co-expressinggpd1 and
gpp2 and simultaneously inhibitinggapA and budA, the levels of
both glycerol and 3-HP were improved (Figure 4, Figure 5). In
addition, the by-products and glucoseﬂux in the EMP pathway
were reduced. The aforementioned results con ﬁrmed the
engineered glucose to the 3-HP pathway inK. pneumoniae.I n
K. pneumoniae, glycerol-based 3-HP synthesis requires only two
reactions, and the theoretical conversion rate is therefore high.
After introducing gpd1 and gpp2 into K. pneumoniae, glucose-
based production of 3-HP requires only four enzyme genes
including gpd, gpp2, gdh, and aldH (e.g., puuC). As for the low
3-HP production, it was ascribed to the presence of glucose. In
particular, the Crabtree effect hindered glycerol utilization.
Future studies may focus on how to attenuate the Crabtree
effect. To address this issue, an orthogonal expression system
could be engineered to express glycerol utilization genes and
minimize the Crabtree effect so that glycerol can be efﬁciently
converted to 3-HP while cell growth is not compromised. Clearly,
profound understanding of thedha regulon and Crabtree effect is
a prerequisite for achieving this goal.
The Crabtree effect and Pasteur effect (Winkler et al., 2003) are
two important regulatory mechanisms affecting glucose
metabolism. The Crabtree effect is a common problem
encountered by mixed carbon source fermentation. Removal of
the Crabtree effect enables bacteria to co-utilize glucose and other
carbon sources. The Pasteur effect entangles the choice of
aeration during fermentation. Aerobic respiration increases
bacterial growth but reduces the activity of
phosphofructokinase through feedback inhibition, thereby
inhibiting the EMP pathway. In fed-batch cultivation, it is
necessary to maintain different oxygen levels in bioreactor for
different purposes. If the Crabtree effect can be attenuated and
aeration can be adjusted in fed-batch cultivation, the strain
will use glucose as a carbon source for growth, which will in
turn improve the production of glycerol and 3-HP. However,
it is extremely challenging to completely decouple glucose
pathways from glycerol path ways, and co-utilization of
different carbon sources may be feasible to maintain active
cell growth.
CRISPRi is usually not lethal to host cell, as it does not digest
DNA. In contrast, gene knockout tools such as CRISPR editing,
RecA homologous recombination, and Red homologous
recombination are in most cases lethal to host cells. In present
study, CRISPRi was developed to inhibit gapA, an enzyme
catalyzes 3-glyceraldehyde triphosphate into 1,3-
diphosphoglyceric acid. CRISPRi was also used to inhibit
budA, an enzyme required for 2,3-BDO production in K.
pneumoniae (Yang et al., 2014). RT-qPCR results showed that
the engineered CRISPRi systems could signiﬁcantly inhibit the
expression of budA and gapA. In shake ﬂask cultivation, the
CRISPRi strain demonstrated slight enhancement in the glycerol
level but signiﬁcant decrease in 2,3-BDO production. However,
the inhibitory effect onbudA was signiﬁcantly reduced when two
groups of sgRNAs were linked in tandem. This might be ascribed
to the low expression of dCas9, which was insufﬁcient for binding
two target genes simultaneously. Plasmid-based overexpression
of dCas9 and multi-copy integration of dCas9 into genome may

be feasible solutions. Overall, this study demonstrated the
feasibility of glucose-to-glycerol as well as CRISPRi-dependent
gene regulation in K. pneumoniae. We anticipate that better
understanding of the metabolic networks is crucial for high-
level production of 3-HP, 1,3-PDO, 2,3-BDO, and beyond.
