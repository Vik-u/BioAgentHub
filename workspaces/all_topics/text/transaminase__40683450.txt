Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1) is caused by the func-
tional deficit of alanine: glyoxylate aminotransferase (AGT1), 
resulting in a build-up of oxalate. PH1 is diagnosed through 
the detection of biallelic pathogenic/likely pathogenic varia-
tions in the AGXT gene. However, the widespread availability 
of genetic screening has led to an increased identification of 
novel variants in patients, yet precisely determining their 
pathogenicity remains a challenge. Since in silico tools can give 
misleading results, functional analyses in disease models are 
needed to confirm the diagnosis. Here, to help the clinical 
assessment of AGXT variants of uncertain significance (VUS), 
we implemented a platform based on a cellular model of PH1, 
made up of HepG2 cells with the endogenous AGXT gene 
knocked out and infected with lentiviral vectors encoding each 
variant. We generated stable clones expressing the two poly-
morphic forms of AGT1 (major: AGT1-Ma and minor: AGT1-
Mi) as negative controls; five validated pathogenic forms as 
positive controls; 13 variants classified according to the 
American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guide-
lines as VUS, benign/likely benign, or conflicting. We analyzed 
each clone for AGT1-specific activity, protein levels, and 
intracellular localization, as well as for its glyoxylate detoxi-
fication ability, as a functional assay. An unbiased global 
analysis of the data allowed unambiguous clustering of both 
non-pathogenic and validated pathogenic variants, thus 
providing information on the possible pathogenicity of each 
variant. As such, our cell platform represents an important 
tool that could be applied to a large number of AGXT variants 
to support the diagnosis of PH1.
Primary hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH1; OMIM 259900) is a 
rare genetic disorder caused by inherited genetic variants on 
the AGXT gene encoding alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase 
(AGT1) (1–3). AGT1 is a liver-specific, vitamin B6–depen-
dent enzyme that catalyzes a transamination reaction to 
convert glyoxylate into glycine in the peroxisomal matrix (4).
Genetic variants in AGXT cause a functional deficit in AGT1, 
which prevents glyoxylate detoxification, thus favoring its 
cytosolic accumulation and consequent oxidation to oxalate 
by hepatic lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) (3). The increased 
endogenous production of oxalate, an end product of human 
metabolism, generates calcium oxalate stones that deposit in 
the kidneys and urinary tract, leading to nephrocalcinosis, 
progressive kidney damage, chronic kidney disease, and kid-
ney failure in most patients (5–7). In the most severe cases, 
systemic oxalosis can occur when the increased production of 
oxalate is compounded by a compromised kidney function, 
thus causing a life-threatening condition where oxalate de-
posits in many tissues, including bones, skin, heart, and retina 
(8).
Based on clinical presentation, the estimated prevalence of 
PH1 is 1 to 3 per million in Europe and North America (9), 
with a higher prevalence in developing countries where 
consanguineous marriages are more common (10); however, 
whole-exome sequencing data suggest a higher genetic prev-
alence implying that the disease could be largely undiagnosed 
(11, 12). The diagnosis of PH1 is established in a proband with 
hyperoxaluria or hyperoxalemia by genetic testing identifying 
biallelic pathogenic genetic variants of AGXT. The spectrum 
of PH1-associated genetic variants is highly heterogeneous, 
with more than 350 genetic variants currently listed in the 
ClinVar database (13). About 67% of the pathogenic variants 
currently identified are missense changes involving residues 
widely spread over the AGT1 structure, in agreement with 
in vitro data indicating that amino acid substitutions can 
cause the deficit of AGT1 function through a variety of mo-
lecular mechanisms, including functional defects (mainly 
related to compromised catalytic efficiency or coenzyme 
binding), structural defects (altered folding efficiency or 
overall stability), and a combination of both (11, 14–16). The 
scenario is further complicated by the fact that two poly-
morphic changes occurring within AGXT and generating the 
so-called “minor allele” (AGT1-Mi) can contribute to the 
molecular pathogenesis of PH1 by exacerbating the effects of 
some genetic variants (17–20). The minor allele, which is 
found in 15 to 20% of the Caucasian population and in 50% of

PH1 patients, is characterized by a 74-bp duplication in intron
1 and two polymorphisms leading to the p.Pro11Leu and the 
p.Ile340Met amino acid substitutions (21–23). Despite minor 
alterations from a catalytic point of view, AGT1-Mi differs 
from AGT1-Ma by a reduction in thermodynamic and kinetic 
stability at the protein level. The p.Pro11Leu change is the 
main cause of AGT1-Mi destabilization, by enhancing its 
aggregation and degradation propensities (17, 24), as well as 
by generating a weak mitochondrial targeting sequence 
(MTS) at the N-terminus of AGT1 (2, 22). The MTS is 
ineffective on AGT1-Mi, but when co-inherited with genetic 
variants affecting folding kinetics, it can lead to the mis-
targeting of the protein to mitochondria, where AGT1 is 
metabolically ineffective (25, 26).
The ease of access to genetic testing and population studies 
has greatly improved PH1 diagnosis in the last years, but they 
have also increased the number of new variants identified. 
Although the consequences of some missense changes have 
been defined, the impact of many novel variants on AGT1 
expression and function still remains unknown, thus 
complicating clinical assessment. Prediction software, segre-
gation studies, and prevalence analyses of the normal popu-
lation and affected families can provide some indications; 
however, for most novel variants, classification as variants of 
unknown significance (VUS) remains.
The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics 
(ACMG) suggests classifying newly identified sequence vari-
ants as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, likely benign, or benign, 
and supporting genetic testing with in vitro or in vivo func-
tional tests of the gene product (27, 28). Our group has 
recently implemented a novel PH1 cellular model based on 
HepG2 cells—a human cell line with conserved glyoxylate/ 
oxalate metabolism derived from hepatocellular carcinoma— 
knocked out for the AGXT gene (AGXT-KO HepG2) using 
CRISPR/Cas9 technology (29). AGXT-KO HepG2 cells 
represent a suitable model to reproduce the pathogenicity of 
PH1-associated variants as they mimic hepatocyte meta-
bolism and protein homeostasis (29).
In this work, we exploited this model to investigate the 
functional properties of a panel of AGXT VUS obtained from 
the gnomAD (the Genome Aggregation Database, https:// 
gnomad.broadinstitute.org/), ClinVar (https://www.ncbi.nlm. 
nih.gov/clinvar/), and ACMG (https://www.acmg.net/) data-
bases, and associated with either the major or minor allele. 
Each variant was stably expressed in AGXT-KO HepG2 cells 
using lentiviral vectors, and the cells were analyzed for AGT1 
expression, specific activity, subcellular localization, and ox-
alate excretion/release with and without glycolate challenge. 
A global analysis of the data allowed us to establish a platform 
for reliable VUS classification.
Results and discussion
Expression of AGXT VUS in a cellular disease model
Immortalized cell lines represent a valuable tool to study 
the impact of inherited missense genetic variants on the 
overall fitness of a target protein and can provide insights into
the pathogenicity of VUS (30). Broadly used cells, such as 
Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in PH1, ensure easy 
management and high expression levels but do not always 
mimic the physiological environment of the target protein 
(22, 31–35). To overcome this problem and better mimic the 
hepatic microenvironment, we used a new PH1 in vitro model 
based on AGXT-KO HepG2 cells (29). Vectors suitable for 
lentiviral infection encoding AGT1-Ma and AGT1-Mi were 
constructed. Infection of AGXT-KO HepG2 cells with 
increasing amounts of lentiviral particles encoding AGT1-Ma 
(Fig. 1, panels A and C) or AGT1-Mi (Fig. 1, panels B and D) 
led to stable cell clones displaying a corresponding increase in 
transaminase-specific activity and AGT1 expression levels 
(Fig. 1). Note that AGXT-KO HepG2 cells display residual 
transaminase activity due to enzymatic activity other than 
AGT1, and that the specific activity of cells expressing AGT1-
Mi is about 83% of that of cells expressing AGT1-Ma, in line 
with previous data obtained in different cellular models (29). 
Since our study goal was to provide quantitative evidence for 
the impact of missense genetic variants at the protein level, 
the experimental platform was set up to obtain comparable 
amounts of transduced DNA for each cell clone (Fig. S1), 
ensuring AGT1 levels and specific activity are similar to those 
of wild-type cells (Fig. 1).
Overall, our data demonstrate that this system provides a 
cost-effective approach for heterologous expression of AGT1 
in hepatic-origin cells, enabling the evaluation of missense 
genetic variants affecting glyoxylate/oxalate metabolism. 
Therefore, we used this platform to analyze the properties of a 
group of 18 AGXT variants involving residues spanning the 
entire protein sequence. The group comprises five validated 
pathogenic variants associated with either the major (p. 
Gly41Arg, p.Ser158Leu, and p.Asp183Asn) or minor (p. 
Gly170Arg and p.Phe152Ile) alleles, serving as positive con-
trols. Additionally, we examined five variants of uncertain 
significance (VUS), four with conflicting interpretations, three 
classified as benign or likely benign, and one unclassified 
variant (Tables 1 and 2) summarizes the preliminary evalua-
tion of each variant using available in silico tools whose 
readout is mainly based on sequence and structure conser-
vation. This information clearly shows that, although the five 
validated genetic variants are considered damaging by most 
software, it is difficult to obtain definitive results without 
further clinical and biochemical analyses. It must also be 
considered that in silico analyses do not consider the allelic 
background of a genetic variant, nor the possible effect of a 
genetic variant on AGT1 subcellular localization, two aspects 
that can be crucial in influencing the penetrance and severity 
of PH1 (12, 21, 36).
Generation and characterization of AGXT variants on the 
background of the major allele
Selected clones of AGXT-KO HepG2 cells infected with 
lentiviral vectors expressing each variant were checked to 
ensure that each one displayed a similar level of exogenous 
AGXT inserted in the genomic DNA, to guarantee that the

observed changes were due to protein-related alterations and 
not to different infection efficiency (Fig. S2A).
All the genetic variants expressed on AGT1-Ma back-
ground, except the Pro314 synonymous change, significantly
reduced AGT1 levels and activity (Fig. 2). Absence of protein-
related alterations on the c.942G>A nucleotide change 
(Pro314Pro) validated the system as the negative control.

for AGT1 polymorphic forms (50–500 μl of supernatants containing lentiviral particles). Specific AGT transaminase activity was assessed in transduced 
AGXT-KO HepG2 cells with (A) AGT1 major (AGT1-Ma) and (B) AGT1 minor (AGT1-Mi) polymorphic forms by a standard spectrophotometric assay. AGT1

of the primary transcript involved in splicing, its conse-
quences on the final mRNA product, if any, remain to be 
determined. Among the genetic variants giving rise to statis-
tically significant alterations, different behaviors can be 
observed for each parameter. Regarding activity, some genetic 
variants gave rise to a moderate reduction in specific activity 
(approx. 40−60% of the value of AGT1-Ma, bright blue in 
Fig. 2A), while others led to a strong effect (light blue in 
Fig. 2A), with specific activity values not significantly different 
from those of the empty vector (e.g., mock LV). As for protein 
levels, a group of variants displayed a moderate reduction of 
protein levels (bright green in Fig. 2B), while another group 
displayed protein levels less than 25% relative to AGT1-Ma 
(light green in Fig. 2B). All produced proteins were respon-
sive to an antibody against Pro11, thus confirming the allelic 
background (Fig. S2B).
A combined analysis of the two parameters allows us to 
draw the following conclusions: a first group of genetic vari-
ants (p.Asp129His, p.Ala186Val, p.Arg197Gln, p.Arg289His) 
has a moderate effect on both activity and protein levels. As 
for Asp129, no remarkable effects of its genetic variation to 
histidine have been found upon expression in yeast and COS-
7 cells (18). However, Asp129 is located in a peripheral loop 
region of the large domain of AGT1 that shows increased 
structural flexibility and is prone to disorder. Genetic variants 
in this region have been found to reduce protein levels and
specific activity in mammalian cells (17), in line with our re-
sults. Notably, the loop region containing Asp129 displays an 
increased flexibility in AGT1-Mi, suggesting that this genetic 
variant could give rise to more pronounced effects on the 
minor allele background. Ala186 is part of a random-coil re-
gion located near the active site, where other pathogenic 
variants have been found, such as p.Ser187Phe, which 
strongly affects coenzyme binding and catalysis (37, 38). It can 
be speculated that the observed mild effects could be caused 
by the conservative Ala-to-Val substitution. A similar 
conclusion can be drawn for the Arg197 genetic variant, in 
line with previous data in both purified AGT1 and CHO cells. 
Indeed, the substitution of Arg197 with a glutamine residue 
disrupts a salt bridge of the large domain and forms a new 
hydrogen bond with the N-terminus (39). Finally, no specific 
molecular studies have been performed on the role of Arg289. 
The finding that this residue is located in a surface region of 
AGT1 could explain why the substitution to histidine does 
not strongly reduce protein intracellular fitness. This agrees 
with genetic studies indicating that the c.866G > A (p. 
Arg289His) is a common polymorphism in the African 
American population (11).
A second group of genetic variants (p.Gly41Arg, p. 
Arg118Cys, p.Ala248Val, p.Arg317Trp, p.Gly365Cys) gave 
rise to strong reductions in AGT1 levels and activity. 
Regarding p.Gly41Arg, our data are consistent with the

5 ′ -phosphate (PLP), which, by shifting the equilibrium toward 
the apo-form of the enzyme, reduces intracellular stability and 
activity (41). Therefore, these data further corroborate the 
pathogenicity of the p.Gly365Cys genetic variant. On the 
other hand, the functional data presented herein provides the 
first molecular characterization of the p.Arg118Cys, p. 
Ala248Val, and p.Arg317Trp genetic variants. Arg118 repre-
sents a key residue for AGT1 dimerization, as shown by the 
destabilizing effects of its mutation to alanine on dimer sta-
bility (42), thus suggesting that its mutation to cysteine could 
promote AGT1 monomerization. Since AGT1 monomer-
ization in turn favors aggregation and intracellular degrada-
tion, it is plausible that the observed effects of the Arg118 
mutation on protein levels and activity observed in HepG2 
cells are directly due to dimer destabilization (43). Ala248 is 
part of a hydrophobic cluster along with Ile244 and Leu247. 
The finding that the mutation of Ile244 to Thr is a PH1-
causing genetic variant common in the Canary Islands (44) 
and leads to AGT1 aggregation corroborates the idea that 
genetic variants in this region could interfere with proper 
folding. Arg317 is part of the small domain of AGT1, and it 
does not directly interact with PLP. Although a precise defi-
nition of the defect of the p.Arg317Trp mutation would 
require studies on the purified protein, it can be hypothesized 
that the substitution of a charged residue with a bulky hy-
drophobic amino acid could lead to a conformational change 
that might increase either AGT1 degradation or aggregation 
propensity, rather than causing a catalytic defect, in line with 
the observed reduction in protein levels and specific activity. 
Of note, the p.Pro28Ser genetic variant led to markedly 
reduced AGT1-specific activity despite a moderate effect on 
protein levels. Since Pro28 is part of a loop region located at 
the entrance of the active site (residues 24–32) connected 
with the N-terminus (40), the p.Pro28Ser change could 
compromise substrate binding to affect catalysis (45), thus 
causing a defect that is both structural and functional. This 
hypothesis could explain the stronger effect displayed by the 
mutation on specific activity rather than on protein levels. 
Indeed, it must be considered that Western blot quantitative 
analyses inform protein levels under denaturing conditions, 
which include both folded and unfolded fractions and it may 
differ from the levels of catalytically active protein. 
Following this path, a combined analysis of the data reveals 
a general correlation between the reduction in specific activity 
and in protein levels (Fig. S3), indicating that the decrease in 
activity is due to a decrease in the amount of protein pro-
duced. Therefore, we tested if the created platform could be 
also useful to recognize the pathogenicity of mutations giving 
rise to catalytic defects, without affecting AGT1 folding. We 
constructed vectors encoding the p.Ser158Leu and the p. 
Asp183Asn mutants and analyzed their protein levels and 
specific activity upon expression in AGXT-KO HepG2 cells 
(Figs. 3 and S3). In line with the expected outcomes, both p. 
Ser158Leu and the p.Asp183Asn expressing clones displayed 
transaminase specific activity similar to mock cells, whereas 
the protein levels were unaffected (Fig. 3, A and B). Results 
agree with previous data showing a catalytic impairment due
to the substitutions of residues Ser158 and Asp183, which are 
both involved in PLP binding within the AGT1 active site 
(24, 46–50).
Generation and characterization of AGXT variants on minor 
allele background
Using the same strategy employed to analyze variants on 
the background of the major allele, we selected and validated 
clones of AGXT-KO HepG2 cells infected with lentiviral 
vectors expressing variants on the minor background of 
AGT1 (AGT1-Mi), and we compared their specific activity 
and protein levels with the corresponding control (e.g., AGT1-
Mi) (Figs. 4 and S4). The p.Phe152Ile, p.Glu274Asp, and p. 
Ile279Thr expressing clones displayed specific activity levels 
not significantly different from those of cells infected with the 
empty vector (light blue, Fig. 4A), thus leading to a strong 
effect, whereas the p.Gly170Arg and p.Arg289Cys preserved a 
residual activity equal to 50% of AGT1-Mi activity (bright 
blue, Fig. 4A). Moreover, all genetic variants significantly 
reduced protein levels relative to AGT1-Mi, although the 
effect was more pronounced (<25% of the control, light 
green, Fig. 4B) for the p.Gly170Arg, and p.Glu274Asp vari-
ants, whereas a moderate effect was observed for the p. 
Phe152Ile, p.Ile279Thr, and p.Arg289Cys variants (bright 
green, Fig. 4B). Given that the polymorphic p.Pro11Leu

amino acid change generates a putative MTS on AGT1 (2, 22), 
the subcellular localization of each species was also evaluated 
(Fig. 5). Clear peroxisomal localization was seen for AGT1-
Ma and AGT1-Mi. Similarly, the p.Arg289Cys genetic 
variant, although on the AGT-Mi background, did not 
significantly affect AGT1 import to peroxisomes. On the 
other hand, the p.Phe152Ile, p.Gly170Arg, and p.Ile279Thr 
genetic variants redirected most AGT1 to mitochondria, 
whereas the p.Glu274Asp genetic variant gave rise to a mixed 
peroxisomal/mitochondrial localization.
Overall, the enzymatic phenotype of the p.Phe152Ile and p. 
Gly170Arg genetic variants is in line with their known path-
ogenicity, which is due to structural changes that reduce 
AGT1 kinetic and thermodynamic stability, and that promote 
its mitochondrial mistargeting by delaying the folding process 
and the interaction with molecular chaperones (22, 33, 42, 
51–56). The finding that the residual-specific activity is 
lower than that expected from the residual whole protein 
expression indicates that part of the protein could be present 
in an inactive form in the cell, in line with previous data 
indicating that p.Phe152Ile with AGT1-Mi undergoes a time-
dependent inactivation at physiological temperature (52). The 
p.Glu274Asp genetic variant does not completely redirect 
AGT1 to mitochondria but has a strong effect on protein 
fitness, in line with previous data obtained using a yeast model 
and purified proteins (18, 47). Indeed, Glu274 is part of a 
conserved region of AGT1, and its mutation to aspartate 
synergizes with the minor allele polymorphism by altering the 
tertiary structure of holo-AGT1 and compromising PLP 
binding, thus reducing enzymatic activity and protein stabil-
ity. Ile279 is not conserved on the AGT1 sequence, and its 
mutation to threonine has been classified as benign based on 
data obtained on the purified variant on the background of 
the major allele, which showed unaltered enzymatic activity, 
in line with the position of the residue far from the active site 
(57). In our experimental setting, the genetic variant is asso-
ciated with the p.Pro11Leu and p.Ile340Met polymorphic 
changes (AGT1-Mi), and the two amino acid substitutions 
synergize in reducing the overall intracellular fitness of the 
protein, as confirmed by the reduction in specific activity and 
protein levels. This finding was also confirmed in a liver bi-
opsy from an individual showing the importance of knowing 
the haplotype in this disease (58). Finally, the possible effects 
of the p.Arg289Cys genetic variant have been only examined 
in yeast-based assays, in which AGT1 stability was unaffected 
(47). However, a patient bearing the p.Arg289Cys genetic 
variant in heterozygosity with the p.Leu298Pro showed early 
stone events leading to nephrolithiasis and nephrocalcinosis 
(59). Our results show that the mutation does not affect 
AGT1 localization, but significantly reduces specific activity 
and protein levels, although the effects seem mild compared 
with those of the other genetic variants. Since Arg289 is 
located on the AGT1 surface, it can be speculated that the 
substitution to Cys could lead to protein aggregation due to

disulfide crosslinking of the mutant protein, especially in an 
oxidative environment such as that of peroxisomes (60).
Functional assay of AGXT variants on glyoxylate 
detoxification
To test whether the analyzed genetic variants affect the 
ability of AGT1 to perform the detoxification of glyoxylate, we 
set up a secondary assay aimed at quantifying oxalate pro-
duction upon cell challenge with glycolate, a glyoxylate 
precursor. As GO, the enzyme responsible for the glycolate-to-
glyoxylate conversion inside peroxisomes, is expressed at low 
levels in HepG2 cells, we first performed a transient trans-
fection of human HAO1 (encoding GO) in AGXT-KO HepG2 
cell clones and then challenged cells with an excess of glycolate 
(29). As shown in Fig. S5, the increase in glycolate oxidase 
(GO) expression upon transfection is paralleled by the increase 
in the amount of oxalate released in the medium upon 10 mM 
glycolate challenge. When GO transfection and glycolate 
challenge were performed in clones of AGXT-KO HepG2 cells 
expressing each variant under study (Fig. 6), it was observed 
that: (i) cells expressing AGT1-Ma and AGT1-Mi show a low 
amount of oxalate released, in line with their physiological 
ability to convert glyoxylate to glycine; (ii) cells expressing the 
p.Pro28Ser, p.Asp129His, and p.Pro314Pro variants release an 
amount of oxalate not different from that of control cells; (iii) 
cells expressing the p.Phe152Ile, p.Arg197Gln, and p. 
Arg289His variants show a moderate increase in oxalate 
release, while (iv) cells expressing the p.Gly41Arg, p.Arg118-
Cys, p.Ser158Leu, p.Gly170Arg, p.Asp183Asn, p.Ala186Val, p. 
Ala248Val, p.Glu274Asp, Ile279Thr, p.Arg289Cys, p. 
Arg317Trp, and p.Gly365Cys genetic variants release oxalate 
amounts similar to those of AGXT-KO HepG2 cells. In the 
case of the p.Asp129His, p.Arg197Gln, p.Arg289His, and p.
Pro314Pro genetic variants, these results agree with the 
moderate or absent effects of the genetic variants on enzyme 
activity and protein levels in the cells (Fig. 2). As for the p. 
Pro28Ser genetic variant, it is unclear how a variant displaying 
a strongly reduced specific activity could perform glyoxylate 
detoxification. It can be speculated that the local glyoxylate 
concentration in peroxisomes could overcome the functional 
defect of the variant by favoring substrate binding. Of note, 
except for p.Ala186Val, and the two known catalytically 
defective mutants p.Ser158Leu and p.Asp183Asn, all species 
showing strongly increased oxalate production also display a 
strong reduction in specific activity and/or protein levels, 
including the three known pathogenic variants of AGT1. 
Although it cannot be excluded that GO transfection could 
have an impact on AGXT expression via an unknown gene 
regulatory mechanism, this could be considered unlikely in 
our cell system because the expression of each genetic variant 
is under the control of the constitutive CMV promoter. 
Nevertheless, it must be considered that the experimental 
setting in which we analyzed oxalate production includes a 
substrate challenge that on the one hand allows insights into 
the functionality of each species, but on the other hand creates 
an environment far from equilibrium, thus influencing the 
relationship between steady-state levels of functional protein 
and glyoxylate detoxification ability. In the case of variants 
associated with the minor allele, the possible effect of aberrant 
localization must be considered.
AGXT VUS classification
To globally analyze the obtained data according to all 
available parameters (i.e., residual protein level, specific ac-
tivity, glycolate detoxification, and protein localization), we 
applied a principal component analysis (PCA) multivariate

presence or absence (Ctr, untreated cells) of glycolate (Glc, 10 mM) for another 24 h. Cell media were collected, and oxalate concentration was measured 
using a spectrophotometric assay. Oxalate levels in medium of AGXT-KO HepG2 cells expressing AGXT variants of unknown significance (VUS) were

statistical approach with hierarchical clustering to group 
samples, as a tool to obtain insights into their possible path-
ogenic effects. As shown in Figure 7, A and B, both PCA plot 
and heat map clearly show AGXT VUS clustering that allows 
VUS classification between deleterious and tolerated variant 
groups. The analysis revealed that the variants under study 
can be grouped into five different clusters, with the two 
principal components contributing to 78% of the variance in 
the data set. (i) Cluster 1 comprises benign variants (B), i.e., 
the two polymorphic forms of AGT1 and, as expected, the 
Pro314 synonymous substitution; (ii) Cluster 2 includes p. 
Pro28Ser-Ma, p.Asp129His-Ma, p.Arg197Gln-Ma, p.Arg289-
Cys-Mi, and p.Arg289His-Ma genetic variants, which can be 
classified as likely benign (LB); (iii-iv) Cluster 3 and 4 com-
prises likely pathogenic (LP) genetic variants that are addi-
tionally subdivided into two distinct clusters based on the 
type of molecular alteration introduced in the AGT1 mole-
cule. Specifically, a first group (LP-I) gathers genetic variants 
mainly affecting AGT1 folding and protein stability (i.e., p. 
Arg118Cys-Ma, p.Ala248Val-Ma, p.Glu274Asp-Mi, p. 
Arg317Trp-Ma, and p.Gly365Cys-Ma); notably, the patho-
genic p.Gly41Arg-Ma genetic variant is also included in this 
group, possibly because its effects are milder if the genetic 
variant is on the background of the major allele (61). On the 
other hand, a second cluster of LP variants (LP-II) includes 
the p.Ala186Val-Ma variant along with the p.Ser158Leu-Ma, 
p.Asp183Asn-Ma known catalytically defective mutants, 
possibly underlying a similar impact of the Ala186Val sub-
stitution at a molecular level; (v) Cluster 5 includes AGXT 
knock-out (mock LV) cells along the two most common 
pathogenic genetic variants (p.Phe152Ile-Mi and p. 
Gly170Arg-Mi), which thus represent a good positive con-
trol, as well as the p.Ile279Thr-Mi genetic variants, which can 
be classified as pathogenic based on the cellular studies. 
Overall, our analysis allows us to provide a reliable classifi-
cation cell-based system for those AGXT VUS that previously 
had conflicting interpretations obtained from in silico (Table 2) 
or clinical/experimental evidence (Table 1). Specifically, of the 
12 AGXT VUS tested, 8 result in a novel classification (benign: 
p.Pro28Ser-Ma, p.Asp129His-Ma, p.Arg289Cys-Mi, and p. 
Arg289His-Ma; disease causing: p.Arg118Cys-Ma, p. 
Ala248Val-Ma, p.Glu274Asp-Mi, and p.Arg317Trp-Ma), 2 
have a confirmed classification (benign: p.Arg197Gln-Ma; 
disease causing: p.Gly365Cys-Ma), and 2 were reclassified as 
pathogenic (p.Ala186Val-Ma and p.Ile279Thr-Mi).
Conclusion
In this work, we aimed at constructing an in vitro platform 
to investigate the pathogenicity of missense genetic variants 
on the AGXT gene associated with either major or minor 
polymorphic forms of AGT1. We used HepG2 cells knocked

out for the endogenous AGXT and infected with lentiviral 
vectors encoding mutant AGT1, a cost-effective approach for 
the expression of missense variants and semi-quantitative 
evaluation of their intracellular fitness. Laboratory geneti-
cists have long been challenged by providing meaningful ge-
netic reports to health care providers when minimal variant 
data are available. Functional studies can elucidate the 
mechanism and extent to which missense genetic variants 
affect protein fitness (i.e., its overall function and/or stability) 
and thus provide insights into their contribution to disease 
susceptibility. Strong in vitro or in vivo evidence of pathoge-
nicity or benign impact per ACMG/Association for Molecular 
Pathology criteria enables reclassification of VUS (27, 62) 
provided that validated, reproducible, and robust assays are 
used (27, 63). The platform described herein, through the 
combined analysis of data on the molecular/cellular conse-
quences of AGXT genetic variants on AGT1, allowed us to 
attribute the genetic variants under analysis to five clusters, 
which could reliably correspond to benign, likely benign, 
likely pathogenic, and pathogenic, as confirmed by internal 
positive and negative controls.
We must acknowledge that our experimental design is not 
suitable for testing the effects of genetic variants affecting 
the promoter region or the primary transcript maturation 
process. Nonetheless, it provides a useful platform for 
exploring the effect of amino acid substitutions on protein 
global fitness, thus representing a tool to predict the path-
ogenicity of newly identified genetic variants and, paired 
with clinical data, to better understand their potential to 
manifest PH1. In this regard, it must be mentioned that our 
PCA analysis included two parameters that are intertwined, 
i.e., variant residual specific activity and the corresponding 
protein levels. Indeed, in many cases, the reduction in spe-
cific activity is due to intracellular instability, thus leading to 
reduced protein levels. Nevertheless, the separation of the 
two parameters can allow a more accurate distinction among 
mutations giving rise a parallel reduction of specific activity 
and protein levels and those causing a pure catalytic defect, 
where a strong reduction in specific activity is observed in 
the absence of a concomitant reduction in protein levels. 
Thus, the usage of opportunely selected known pathogenic 
mutants as references confers to our platform the prediction 
power needed to discriminate benign and pathogenic vari-
ants, and possibly predict, among the pathogenic ones, var-
iants producing purely catalytic defects from the inducing 
protein misfolding.
However, we must consider that our study has been car-
ried out in a small set of genetic variants, and that an 
extension of the study to a larger group and number of 
measured variables could strengthen the accuracy of the 
analysis and allow a more robust classification of known and 
newly identified genetic variants. Moreover, it must be 
considered that even genetic variants classified as likely 
benign in our platform could give rise to a pathogenic effect 
in the presence of a different allelic background and/or in 
compound heterozygosity with another genetic variant that 
gives rise to a synergic alteration of the structural/functional
properties of AGT1. Nonetheless, our platform could sup-
port the diagnosis of PH1 starting from a comprehensive 
analysis that considers not only the clinical features of pa-
tients and evaluates their genetic data, but also the effects of 
each identified genetic variant in standardized functional 
assays. This could be an important premise to establish ge-
notype/phenotype correlations, as well as to perform pre-
clinical tests of therapeutic efficacy of pyridoxine therapy 
and putative new drugs.
Experimental procedures
Materials
PLP, L-alanine, sodium glyoxylate, and rabbit muscle LDH 
were purchased from Merck Life Science. Oligonucleotides 
for site-directed mutagenesis and genome editing screening 
were obtained from Bio-Fab Research srl. The lentiviral 
transfer vector carrying codon-optimized AGXT cDNA (lenti-
hCMV-AGXT_BC132819-OP-IRES-puro) was purchased

genesis (see, Generation and characterization of AGXT vari-
ants on minor allele background). Packaging (pCMVR8.74) 
and envelope (pCMV-VSV-G) plasmids were kindly provided

Cell culture
HepG2 cells were a gift from Prof. Brunetti-Pierri (Tele-
thon Institute of Genetics and Medicine). AGXT-KO HepG2 
cells were generated as previously described (29) and main-
tained in high-glucose Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s Medium 
(DMEM) containing 2 mM L-glutamine and 1 mM sodium 
pyruvate (D6429; Merck Life Science) and supplemented with 
10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, Thermo Fisher Scienti-

Site-directed mutagenesis
The lentiviral transfer vector encoding the human AGT1 
major polymorphic form (AGT1-Ma) was first used to pre-
pare the vector encoding the AGT1 minor polymorphic form 
(AGT1-Mi), with two sequential rounds of site-directed 
mutagenesis to introduce the two amino acid substitutions 
(i.e., p.Pro11Leu and p.Ile340Met) (41). Next, selected VUS 
and known pathogenic AGXT variants were introduced on 
the desired allelic background using either AGT1-Ma or 
AGT1-Mi transfer vectors. The complete list of AGXT vari-
ants and associated oligonucleotides used for mutagenesis are 
reported in Table S1. PCR products were transformed in One 
Shot Stbl3 Escherichia coli chemically competent cells 
(C7373–03; Thermo Fisher Scientific) using heat shock 
method (incubations involving 30 min on ice, 45 s at 42 ◦ C, 
and 2 min on ice). Upon transformation, cells were cultured 
in 500 μl of SOC medium for 1 h at 37 ◦ C, and then plated on 
Luria-Bertani agar plates containing ampicillin (100 μg/ml). 
Mutagenesis was confirmed in isolated plasmids by Sanger 
sequencing using the primers reported in Table S1. Correctly 
mutagenized vectors were amplified and extracted using the 
ZymoPURE II Plasmid Midiprep Kit (Zymo Research Cor-
poration) and used for lentivirus production.
Lentiviral vector preparation and cell transduction
Lentiviral particles carrying AGXT variants were prepared 
using a second-generation lentiviral system, with cells from 
the HEK293FT cell line used as packaging cells. HEK293FT 
cells were transfected transiently using PolyJet reagent (Sig-
naGen Laboratories), according to the manufacturer’s in-
structions. Briefly, HEK293FT cells (2 × 10 6 ) were seeded in 
100 mm tissue culture–treated plates (Sarstedt AG & Co KG) 
and incubated in complete medium for 24 h at 37 ◦ C and with 
5% CO 2 . One hour prior to transfection, cells were incubated 
in complete medium without geneticin and were then
transfected with a mixture composed of 1.5 μg of transfer 
plasmid, 2.25 μg of pCMV-VSV-G envelope plasmid, and 
2.25 μg of pCMVR8.74 packaging plasmid, diluted in 250 μl of 
DMEM medium base. Cells were then mixed with 18 μl of 
transfection reagent dissolved in 250 μl of DMEM medium 
base. Transfection mixtures (final volume of 500 μl/reaction) 
were incubated for 15 min at room temperature (RT), then 
added dropwise onto cells. After 5 h, the medium was 
removed, and 6 ml of fresh complete medium (without 
geneticin) was added for 72 h to each plate. Next, cell media 
were harvested and centrifuged for 5 min at 800g, and su-
pernatants were filtered through 0.45 μm filters (SLGP033RS; 
Merck Life Science). Finally, lentiviruses were aliquoted and 
stored at −80 ◦ C.
For cell transduction, AGXT-KO HepG2 cells were seeded 
in complete DMEM in 6-well plates (0.4 × 10 6 /well) 24 h 
before transduction. Cells were transduced for 24 h in 1 ml 
of fresh complete medium, added with different amounts of 
lentiviral preparations (50–500 μl), and in the presence of 
12 μg/ml of polybrene (TR-1003-G; Merck Life Science). 
After transduction, cells were incubated with fresh culture 
medium for an additional 24 h. Finally, cells were selected 
using 2.5 μg/ml puromycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 
72 h to obtain clones expressing different AGXT variants. 
Afterwards, cells were maintained in standard complete 
medium.
Semi-quantitative PCR
To determine the efficiency of viral DNA integration into 
cellular DNA, genomic DNA was extracted from transduced 
cells using the Quick-DNA Miniprep Kit (Zymo Research 
Corporation) and semi-quantitative PCR was performed using 
primers specific for the amplification of exogenous AGXT (i. 
e., hAGXTeng) only. Primers for human GAPDH were used as 
an endogenous loading control. PCR protocol was performed 
as previously described (66), with slight modifications as fol-
lows: PCR mixtures consisted of 40 ng of genomic DNA, 
0.2 μM primers, and 1× JumpStart REDTaq ReadyMix (1×; 
Merck Life Science srl), in a final volume of 20 μl/reaction. 
The PCR thermal profile was 3 min at 95 ◦ C, then 25 cycles of 
30 s at 95 ◦ C, 30 s at 60 ◦ C, and 30 s at 72 ◦ C, with a final 
extension step of 5 min at 72 ◦ C. PCR products were loaded 
on 1.5% agarose gel stained with SYBR Safe DNA Gel Stain 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific) and visualized using an iBright 
CL1500 Imaging System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Primers 
sequences used for semi-quantitative PCR were: hAGX-

AGXT transaminase activity assay and immunoblot analysis
Cells (4 × 10 6 ) were grown in Petri dishes (10 cm) for 24 h 
and then recovered by cell scraping on ice and pelleted by 
centrifugation for 5 min at 800g. Cell pellets were suspended

in 0.1 ml of PBS containing cOmplete protease inhibitor 
cocktail (1×, Roche Molecular Systems, Inc), and 100 μM PLP, 
and then lysed by sonication on ice with pulses of 5 s, twice. 
Cell lysates were centrifuged for 10 min at 13,000g at 4 ◦ C, 
and total protein concentration was measured on recovered 
supernatants by a standard Bradford assay (B6916, Merck Life 
Science srl) performed on microplates following the manu-
facturer’s protocol. Total cell lysates obtained from cells 
expressing AGXT variants were used to determine specific 
AGT enzymatic activity by a standard spectrophotometric 
assay (29, 67). A fixed amount of total protein (100 μg) was 
incubated in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) in 
the presence of 200 μM PLP, 0.5 M L-alanine, and 10 mM 
glyoxylate, in a final volume of 50 μl, for 30 min at 37 ◦ C. The 
reactions were stopped by adding 6 μl of trichloroacetic acid 
(TCA, 10% v/v), and pyruvate production was measured by 
monitoring NADH oxidation at 340 nm using a spectropho-
tometric assay coupled with LDH assay.
Cell protein content was measured by Bradford assay in a 
96-multiwell plate format with Multiskan SkyHigh spectro-
photometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For immunoblot an-
alyses, samples (30 μg/lane) were loaded onto sodium dodecyl 
sulfate-polyacrylamide gels and blotted onto a nitrocellulose 
membrane through a Trans-Blot Turbo Transfer System (Bio-
Rad Laboratories). Membranes were incubated overnight at
4 ◦ C with the following primary antibodies: anti-AGT1 
(1:10,000) and anti-GO (1:500). As a loading control, mem-
branes were incubated with anti–β-tubulin (1:5000). Filters 
were then incubated with the appropriate HRP-conjugated 
secondary antibodies (1:5000) for 1 h. The chem-
iluminescence signal was detected by an iBright CL1500 Im-
aging System (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Densitometric 
analysis was performed using the iBright analysis software 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Immunofluorescence
Cells (8 × 10 4 /well) expressing AGXT variants were seeded 
in 24-well plates on polylysine-coated 12 mm coverslips 
(Knittel glass) and incubated for 24 h. For staining mito-
chondria, an incubation step of 30 min at 37 ◦ C with Mito-
Tracker Red CMXRos (M7512; Thermo Fisher Scientific) was 
performed prior to fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde dis-
solved in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). Next, cells were 
permeabilized and blocked (40 min at RT with PBS + 3% 
bovine serum albumin, and 0.3% Triton X-100), and then 
incubated with the primary antibodies anti-AGT1 (1:5000) 
and anti–peroxisomal catalase (1:250). After the incubation, 
samples were washed three times with PBS for 5 min and then 
incubated with anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 (1:500, A-11008; 
Thermo Fisher Scientific) or anti–guinea pig Alexa Fluor 555 
(1:500, A-21435; Thermo Fisher Scientific) secondary anti-
bodies for 1 h at RT, rinsed in PBS for 5 min three times, 
counterstained with 10 μg/ml of Hoechst 33,342 (H3570; 
Thermo Fisher Scientific) for 10 min in PBS, and washed in 
PBS for 5 min three times before mounting with Dako
mounting medium (Agilent Technologies). Image acquisition 
was performed by a semi-confocal fluorescence microscope 
equipped with an AxioVision MRm digital camera and Apo-
Tome filtering device (Carl Zeiss) at 63× magnification. 10 
different fields were acquired for each variant, consisting of 
approximately 50 cells per sample (68, 69). Figure cropping 
and labelling were performed using the GIMP software (ver. 
2.10.36).
Oxalate determination
Oxalate levels were determined in media of cells trans-
fected for 24 h with pCDNA3.1 vector containing human GO 
cDNA using GenJet reagent (SignaGen Laboratories) (29), 
and treated for an additional 24 h with or without glycolate 
challenge (10 mM). After incubation, cell medium was 
collected and immediately processed. Samples (0.8 ml) were 
concentrated for 3 h at 37 ◦ C with a SpeedVac Vacuum 
Concentrator (Thermo Fisher Scientific) until a volume of 
100 μl was reached. Oxalate concentration was assessed with 
a kit provided by Trinity Biotech Plc. following manufac-
turer’s instructions, with modifications: concentrated samples 
(100 μl) were diluted with an equal volume of sample diluent 
reagent and incubated for 5 min at RT with activated char-
coal. Samples were then centrifuged for 10 min at 4000×g and 
supernatants (50 μl) were transferred to a new tube con-
taining 250 μl of reagent A. After the addition of 25 μl of 
reagent B, samples were incubated for 5 min at RT and ox-
alate concentration was determined by measuring absorbance 
at 590 nm in a Multiskan SkyHigh microplate reader (Thermo 
Fisher Scientific).
Statistical analysis
For data analysis and plotting, GraphPad v.[8.4.2] (Dot-
matics, Boston, MA) and R version 4.1.3 https://www.R-
project.org/. Accessed May 2024 were used. Data are 
expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Student’s t test 
was used to assess the significance of differences between two 
groups, while two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) fol-
lowed by Dunnett’s multiple comparison post hoc test was 
used for comparisons including multiple groups and different 
types of variables. A p value < 0.05 was considered statisti-
cally significant.
PCA and clustering were performed to group variants 
based on residual specific activity, protein levels, glyoxylate 
detoxification ability, and subcellular localization. Glyoxylate 
detoxification was calculated as the relative reduction of ox-
alate in the medium as compared with mock LV cells, by 
setting the reduction of AGT1-Ma cells to 1. For localization, 
a value of 1 was assigned to variants with peroxisomal local-
ization, 0.5 for mixed mitochondrial/peroxisomal localization, 
and 0.0 for aberrant mitochondrial localization. The PCA plot 
was generated with factoextra R package. Data were clustered 
using hierarchical clustering, while gap statistics embedded in 
the factoextra package were used to a priori determine the
