Abstract: 
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the most widely produced man-made polymers and is 
a signiﬁcant contributor to microplasNcs polluNon.  The environmental and human health impacts 
of microplasNcs polluNon have moNvated a concerted eﬀort to develop microbe - and enzyme-
based strategies to degrade PET and similar plasNcs. A PETase derived from the bacteria Ideonella 
sakaiensis was previously shown to enzymaNcally degrade PET, triggering mulNdisciplinary eﬀorts 
to improve the robustness and acNvity of this and other PETases . However, because these 
enzymes only erode the surface of the insoluble PET substrate, it is diﬃcult to measure standard 
kineNc parameters, such as kon, koﬀ and kcat, complicaNng interpretaNon of the acNvity of mutants 
using tradiNonal enzyme kineNcs frameworks. To address this challenge, we developed a single-
molecule microscopy assay that quanNﬁes the landing rate and binding duraNon of quantum dot-
labeled PETase enzymes interacNng with a surface -immobilized PET ﬁlm. Wild-type PETase 
binding duraNons were well ﬁt by a biexponenNal with a fast populaNon having a 2.7 s Nme 
constant, interpreted as acNve binding events, and a slow populaNon interpreted as non-speciﬁc 
binding interacNons that last tens of seconds . A previously described hyperacNve mutant,  
S238F/W159H had both a faster on-rate and a slower oﬀ-rate than wild-type PETase, potenNally 
explaining its enhanced acNvity. Because this single-molecule approach provides a more detailed 
mechanisNc picture of PETase enzymaNc acNvity  than standard bulk assays, it should aid future 
eﬀorts to engineer more robust and acNve PETases to combat global microplasNcs polluNon.

Introduc'on 
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the most widely produced man-made polymers, and 
is derived from petroleum by the esteriﬁcaNon of terephthalic acid and  ethylene glycol.  
AccumulaNon of PET and other microplasNcs in the environment is a pressing global problem that 
has moNvated eﬀorts to develop microbe- and enzyme-based strategies to degrade PET (1, 2).  In 
2016, Yoshida et al. reported a newly discovered bacterium, Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6, that was 
able to use PET as its major carbon and energy source for growth. The PETase enzyme derived 
from this microbe, IsPETase, was shown to convert PET to mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid 
(MHET), with trace amounts of terephthalic acid (TPA) and bis(2 -hydroxyethyl)-TPA (BHET) as 
secondary products  (3). This discovery  set oﬀ a global interdisciplinary eﬀort to idenNfy, 
characterize and opNmize PET degrading enzymes, with the hope that these biodegradaNon 
approaches can be scaled up to reduce microplasNcs polluNon in the environment (4, 5). 
Current methods to evaluate the speciﬁc acNvity of PETases have included analysis of PET surface 
erosion by scanning electron microscope (SEM), quanNfying decreases in PET crystallinity using 
diﬀerenNal scanning calorimetry , and measuring product released by HPLC (6–8). These bulk 
assays provide quanNtaNve informaNon on enzyme acNvity, but relaNng these measurements to 
the speciﬁc enzyme kineNc parameters of the PETase enzymes is complicated by the insolubility 
of PET and the fact that enzymes only act on exposed surfaces. AlternaNvely, there are 
turbidimetric or colorimetric methods for PETase enzyme acNvity, such as the soluble substrates 
p-nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA) and p-nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB), but these soluble substrates are 
poor analogs for crystalline PET (7, 9).  
Like PETases, cellulases and c uNnases are enzymes that react only with the surface of their 
insoluble subtrates  (10). Because the eﬀecNve surface: volume relaNonship is generally not 
known, it is diﬃcult to direc tly apply the Michaelis -Menten formalism  to these reacNons . 
Speciﬁcally, the resulNng KM values are not in typical molar conce ntraNons, making it diﬃcult to 
extract the bimolecular on - and oﬀ-rates, kon and koﬀ, as well as the enzyme turnover rate, kcat. 
One approach that has been used extensively on  enzymes like cellulases or cuNnases is to vary 
the enzyme concentraNon rather than the substrate concentraNon in the soluNon, such that

enzymes parNNon to bound and soluble fracNons (11–13). However, even here the available area, 
𝐴!, is a key parameter that must be esNmated rather than precisely measured.  In contrast, single-
molecule approaches directly measure binding rates and duraNons, and thus the y oﬀer more 
direct access to true biochemical parameters of enzymes.  Further, because the acNvity of the 
enzyme (rather than the substrate)  is monitored, the y sidestep the requirement of relaNng 
exposed surface area to substrate mass or volume, which bulk assays typically require. To this end, 
by imaging the cellulase Cel7A binding to and moving along its insoluble substrate, cellulose, we 
were able to extract enzyme kineNc parameters from the single-molecule tracking dynamics (14).    
Previous work that used bulk enzymaNc assays and molecular dynamics simulaNons to invesNgate 
key residues in the substrate binding cleg of Ideonella sakaiensis PETase idenNﬁed two mutants 
with altered acNviNes (6). A hyperacNve mutant, S238F/W159H, was created that narrowed the 
substrate binding cleg towards that of naNve cuNnase, and an impaired mutant, W185A was 
created by mutaNng a highly mobile tryptophan thought to play a role in substrate binding. The 
altered enzyme acNviNes were measured by imaging the surface erosion of PET  using electron 
microscopy and by monitoring changes in the crystallinity of the PET substrate. These 
experimental approaches clearly showed changes in enzyme acNvity, parNcularly the enhanced 
acNvity of the hyperacNve mutant, but because the methodology did not quanNfy kon, koﬀ and kcat, 
it is diﬃcult to deﬁne in enzymaNc terms which transiNon rates are altered by the mutaNons. 
In the present work, we measured the single -molecule binding dynamics of Ideonella sakaiensis 
PETase wild-type and both the hyperacNve and impaired mutants characterized previously.  We 
used total internal reﬂecNon ﬂuorescence microscope (TIRFM) of quantum dot (Qdot) labeled 
PETase reversibly binding to glass coverslips funcNonalized with a thin ﬁlm of PET.  By measuring 
the residence Nme of the enzymes on the substrate, we calcu late an apparent oﬀ -rate that 
provides informaNon about both the turnover rate of the enzyme and its binding aﬃnity to the 
PET substrate.  This work provides new insights into PETa se funcNon and  introduces a new 
approach for invesNgaNng the enzymology of other enzymes that react with insoluble substrates.

Qdot655-labeled PETase binds reversibly to PET substrate 
To observe the behavior of PETase enzymes on an immobilized PET surface, PET was dissolved in 
triﬂuoroaceNc acid and dripped onto the surface of a coverslip, which was then covered by 
another plasma cleaned coverslip to make thin PET ﬁlm on the surface of both coverslips. The 
PET-funcNonalized coverslip was incorporated into a ﬂow cell, and 0.33 mg/ml casein was ﬂowed 
through to reduce nonspeciﬁc protein adsorpNon.  Ideonella sakaiensis PETase (Addgene Number: 
#112202) (6) was bacterially expressed and bioNnylated (see Methods), and combined  with

streptavidin-coated Qdot parNcles at a 10:1 enzyme:Qdot raNo. The PETase-Qdot complexes were 
then introduced into the ﬂow cell and allowed to interact with the PET surface.  Landing events 
were imaged by total internal reﬂecNon ﬂuorescence microscop y (TIRFM) on a custom -built 
mulNmodal microscope (15), and movies were obtained of the enzymes reversibly binding to the 
surface-immobilized PET.  
To quanNfy the reversible binding interacNons, we developed a kymograph-based approach (Fig. 
1B; described in Methods) to measure the frequency and duraNon of PETase binding events. The 
5 frames/s video consists of a stack of x-y images through Nme. The binding events in our assay 
are focal-limited spots of diameter  ~300 nm, corresponding to the point-spread funcNon of the 
microscope (15). Because the events are relaNve ly rare, we can collapse a given image in y - 
without superimposing diﬀerent events.  When this image is rotated by 90°, the resulNng image 
corresponds to the posiNons in x along the horizontal axis and Nme along the verNcal axis (Fig. 
1B). From this kymograph, the binding duraNons are measured by the length of the verNcal lines, 
where one pixel equals one frame, and the landing rate is measured by counNng the total number 
of events throughout the enNre movie.  
We found that the distribuNon of binding duraNons of wild-type PETase was well ﬁt by a double 
exponenNal funcNon consisNng of a fast phase with a Nme constant of 2.7 ± 0.12 s (ﬁt ± SE of the 
ﬁt for all Nme constants) and a slow phase with a Nme constant of 38.6 s (Fig. 1C).

photobleaching of 117.9 s and 76.3 s at 70 mW and 150 mW illumina@on, respec@vely. 
 
Slow binding phase is consistent with non-speciﬁc binding 
To beper understand the origin of the fast and slow binding populaNons, we carried out a control 
experiment using Qdots with no PETase bound. Using 70 mW laser power, Qdots were observed 
to reversibly bind to the surface, and the binding duraNons followed a biexponenNal with a fast 
phase of 1.5 ± 0.08 s (faster than the PETase fast phase of 2.7 s) and a slow phase of 51.1 ± 2.0 s 
(Fig. 2A) . We hypothesized that the slow Nme constant may be due to nonspeciﬁc and/or 
irreversible binding of Qdots  to the surface, with the apparent unbinding rate being due to 
photobleaching or blinking of the Qdots.  I f this were the case, then  increasing laser power to 
accelerate bleaching should shorten the Nme constant of the slow phase. To test this, we repeated 
the control Qdot experiment using a 150 mW laser illuminaNon  and found that the slow Nme 
constant shortened from 51.1 s to 23.3 s, as expected, while the fast Nme constant remained at 
1.5 s (Fig. 2B).  This result is consistent with the slow phase being due to irreversible binding 
events whose duraNons are truncated by photobleaching or blinking, rather than dissociaNon.  
To further validate our photobleaching hypothesis, we immobilized Qdots  on the surface and 
quanNﬁed their populaNon-level photobleaching rate. To do this, we ﬂowed 50 pM Qdots (lacking 
PETase) into the ﬂow cell without ﬁrst blocking the PET surface to prevent nonspeciﬁc adsorpNon, 
washed away any free Qdots that did  not bind, and imaged these nonspeciﬁcally-bound Qdots 
under conNnuous laser illuminaNon. T he average ﬂuorescence intensity of the image  fell 
exponenNally over Nme due to photobleaching of the immobilized Qdots (Fig. 2C). At 70 mW laser 
power, the Nme constant was 118 s, and at 150 mW laser power, the Nme constant fell to 76.3 s, 
consistent with faster Qdot photobleaching at higher laser powers. This populaNon-level result 
reinforced our single-molecule result in Fig. 2AB, supporNng our conclusion that the slow Nme 
constant in the PETase experiments (Fig. 1) is due to slow photobleaching of Qdots that are 
nonspeciﬁcally bound to the surface.

We next used our single-molecule PETase assay to invesNgate the reversible binding dynamics of 
two previously described PETase mutants. AusNn et al. generated a hyperacNve double mutant, 
S238F/W159H, which was designed to narrow the acNve site of the enzyme and was found to 
degrade crystalline PET more eﬀecNvely than wild -type (6).  They also generated an inacNve 
mutant W185A, which was found to have impaired acNvity compared to wild-type PETase (6).

RepeaNng our wild-type approach, we bacterially expressed, puriﬁed, and bioNnylated  the two 
mutants, adsorbed them to Qdots, and quanNﬁed the ir binding duraNons.  Comparing the fast 
phases, which correspond to reversible binding, the hyperacNve mutant had a Nme constant of  
4.0 ± 0.07 s (ﬁt ± SE of the ﬁt) , longer than the wild -type (2.7 ± 0.12 s), whereas the impaired 
variant had a Nme constant of 1.7 ± 0.18 s, shorter than wild -type (Fig. 3A -C). These binding 
duraNons are consistent with the hyperacNve mutant having a higher PET binding aﬃnity, and the 
impaired mutant having a lower binding aﬃnity than wild-type.   
To quanNfy the relaNve on-rates for PET binding, we quanNﬁed the binding frequency of the three 
PETase enzymes along with the Qdot control  (Fig. 3D) . Binding rates were normalized to the 
enzyme concentraNon and to the area of the microscope image. The binding rate of the impaired 
mutant, 1014 ± 282 μm-2 · s-1 · M-1 (mean ± SEM for N=7 movies) was similar to the wild-type rate 
of 1070 ± 310 μm-2 · s-1 · M-1 (N = 9).  Notably, the hyperacNve mutant landed more frequently, at 
2141 ± 254 μm-2 · s-1 · M-1 (N = 7) than wild-type.  Taken together, the results suggest that the 
hyperacNve mutant achieves a higher PET binding aﬃnity through both a faster on -rate and a 
slower oﬀ-rate.  Finally , the landing rate for  the Qdot control lacking PETase was 394 ± 113 / 
μm2 · s · M (N = 11), roughly 1/3 of wild-type PETase (Fig. 3D, dashed line). This nonspeciﬁc Qdot-
PET interacNon in the absence of enzyme means that the observed landing rates of the three 
enzymes are somewhat overesNmated; it follows that the measured enhancement of the landing 
rate of the hyperacNve mutant is a lower limit of the eﬀect. A rough correcNon for this nonspeciﬁc 
binding fracNon is to consider the dashed red line in Fig 3D as the baseline.

pNPA acts as a compe??ve inhibitor for PET binding 
To more thoroughly conﬁrm that the observed binding interacNons truly reﬂect the enzymaNc 
acNvity of the wild-type and mutant PETases, we used a PETase inhibitor to more clearly separate 
out speciﬁc binding from the various non -speciﬁc interacNons that may be occurring. 4-
Nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA) is a model soluble substrate that is used for measuring the acNvity of 
esterases including PETases (7). We reasoned that when used at high concentraNons, pNPA should

serve as a compeNNve inhibitor of the PETases , occupying the acNve site  and blocking enzyme 
binding to the immobilized PET ﬁlm. Thus, we repeated the single-molecule binding experiments 
in the presence of 4 mM pNPA. 
pNPA reduced the binding duraNon of wild -type PETase and the hyperacNve variant, but  had 
negligible eﬀect on the binding duraNons of the impaired mutant and the control Qdots lacking 
bound PETase (Fig. 4A). The clear eﬀects of pNPA on the wild-type and hyperacNve PETase provide 
further validaNon that the fast binding duraNon s are reporNng producNve interacNons of the 
enzymes with the immobilized PET.  In contrast, t he ﬁnding that the binding duraNon of the 
impaired mutant did not change in the presence of pNPA calls into quesNon whether this mutant 
is speciﬁcally binding to the immobilized PET at all under our condiNons.  
The impacts of pNPA on the landing rate mirrors the eﬀects on the binding duraNon.  Speciﬁcally, 
pNPA strongly diminished the landing rate of the wild -type and hyperacNve mutant, whereas it 
had a negligible eﬀect on the landing rate of the impaired mutant and the Qdot control (Fig. 4B). 
To beper separate out contribuNons to the landing rate from speciﬁc binding versus nonspeciﬁc 
binding, we ﬁrst quanNﬁed the relaNve amplitudes of the fast and slow phases from the 
biexponNal ﬁts (Fig. 4C). For wild -type and the hyperacNve mutant, the amplitudes of the fast 
duraNons were diminished by  pNPA, consistent with the inhibitor blocking the speciﬁc (fast) 
interacNons. As expected, the relaNve amplitudes of the i mpaired mutant and the Qdot control 
were unaﬀected by pNPA. In the ﬁnal analysis in Fig. 4D, we mulNplied the overall landing ra te 
from Fig. 4B by the relaNve amplitude of the fast phase from Fig. 4C. This corrected landing rate 
corresponds to the degree to which the pNPA inhibitor blocks funcNonal binding of the PETases 
to the immobilized PET.  In summary, the pNPA results argue that both wild-type and hyperacNve 
mutant PETase bind speciﬁcally and reversibly to the PET, with hyperacNve mutant having a faster 
relaNve on-rate.

Discussion 
Despite a number of studies that have used bulk assays and computaNonal simulaNons to 
invesNgate the enzymaNc acNviNes of PETases, there has been liple work at the single -molecule 
level aimed at uncovering their enzymology.  Because the single-molecule approaches developed 
here enable us to measure and quanNfy binding events directly, they provide new informaNon 
that can be integrated into more comprehensive studies of the enzymology of PETases and similar 
enzymes. These molecular insights can point to new direcNons for opNmizing PETases to the point 
that they can be scaled up to tackle the signiﬁcant problem of microplasNcs polluNon in the 
environment. 
The most challenging aspect of these single -molecule invesNgaNons was separaNng speciﬁc 
binding of the enzymes from nonspeciﬁc binding by the Qdot probes. Due to autoﬂuorescence of 
the PET sample, labeling the PETases with standard ﬂuorophores such as rhodamine resulted in 
an insuﬃcient signal-to-noise for reliable detecNon. Instead, we turned to Qdots, which gave a 
very good signal-to-noise, but suﬀered from non -speciﬁc binding to the PET. We explored using 
surfactants to reduce nonspeciﬁc bin ding but were unable to ﬁnd condiNons that eliminated 
nonspeciﬁc binding while retaining speciﬁc binding.  Thus, we carried out a series of control 
experiments to determine source of the fast and slow Nme constants we idenNﬁed in our 
biexponenNal dwell Nmes ﬁts. 
By characterizing Qdots  lacking bound PETase and varying laser intensity to characterize 
photobleaching, we concluded that the slow Nme constant (~tens of seconds) of our 
biexponenNal ﬁt to the dwell Nme distribuNons was due to nonspeciﬁc binding. The Qdot control 
lacking any bound enzymes had a residual binding interacNon with a dwell Nme of 1.9 ± 0.12 s, 
but the landing frequency was substanNally lower than Qdots containing a bound PETase (Fig. 3C 
and D).  This lower landing rate and the elevated binding duraNons of t he wild-type PETase and 
the hyperacNve mutant  were the ﬁrst indicaNon that the assays were detecNng speciﬁc PET -
PETase interacNons. The strongest evidence that the fast binding populaNon was indeed speciﬁc 
binding of the PETase to the immobilized PET was the fact that in the presence of the inhibitor 
pNPA, both the dwell Nmes and the landing rate s of the wild -type PETase and the hyperacNve

mutant fell to near the Qdot control (Fig. 4). The most important experimental result was that the 
mean dwell Nme of wild-type PETase was 2.7 s, the dwell Nme of the hyperacNve S238F/W159H 
mutant was 4.0 s, and the dwell Nme of the impaired W185A mutant was 1.7 s, which was similar 
to control Qdots. 
What can single -molecule imaging of enzymes tell  us about the ir kineNc parameters? The 
Michaelis-Menten framework consists of a reversible binding step , with rates kon and koﬀ, and a 
catalyNc step, kcat.   
 
The standard assumpNon is that product unbinding is fast relaNve to the catalyNc step and is thus 
lumped into kcat. For single-molecule visualizaNon of enzymes binding to an insoluble substrate, 
we are visualizing the ES complex (meaning the clock starts when the ﬂuorescent enzyme binds 
to the surface) .  What we measure is dissociaNon from the surface, which is described by the

0.6 s-1 for the impaired mutant.   
The ﬁrst result that comes out of this analysis is that the upper limit for k cat for wild-type PETase 
is 0.37 s-1. This conclusion comes from the fact that dissociaNon of the enzyme from the substrate 
is either through unbinding before catalysis (koﬀ) or via a catalyNc event followed by dissociaNon 
from the “product” (cleaved PET in our case), with rate kcat. It should be noted that the catalyNc 
event may be considerably faster than this, meaning that the lumped kcat parameter is rate -
limited by product release.  However, the funcNonal turnover rate would be the same in this case, 
as would the apparent kcat that we observed.  This slow turnover rate presumably is related to 
the crystallinity of PET ﬁlm and the fact that experiments were performed at room temperature. 
Previous work showed that higher degrees of crystallinity lead to greater resistance of PET to 
enzymaNc hydrolysis (16, 17).  It is proposed that as temperatures approach the glass transiNon

temperature of PET, the mobility of the PET chain increases  and results in more rapid enzymaNc 
hydrolysis (11, 18).  Our kcat of 0.37 s-1 does seem slow; however, published PETase acNviNes to 
date have generally been characterized by degradaNon of the substrate  (6, 7) rather than the 
actual turnover rate of the enzyme.  Thus, to our knowledge there are no values in the literature 
for the kcat of PETase on crystalline PET with which to compare our inferred rate. 
The enzyme dissociaNon rates that we measure also provide insights into how mutaNons alter the 
kineNc parameters of the enzymes.  We interpret our data in the context of the simple Michaelis-
Menten model showin in Fig. 5. The hyperacNve mutant, S238F/W159H was chosen by AusNn et 
al. because the mutaNons narrowed the acNve cleg of the enzyme to match that of other 
cuNnases (6). Induced ﬁt docking simulaNons predicted that this double mutant would have much 
higher aﬃnity for PET, though no predicNons were made on how the mutaNons may alter kcat. We 
ﬁnd that 𝑘"##

because a faster kcat predicts a faster 𝑘"##
$%%. (Fig. 5), our data argue that the greater surface erosion 
and decrease in crystallinity seen with this mutant in a previous study (6) do not result from an 
elevated kcat. Instead, the data argue that the rate of reversible binding from the substrate, koﬀ, is 
slowed in the hyperacNve mutant. The ﬁrst eﬀect of slowing koﬀ is a lower KM, which will improve 
performance at sub-saturaNng substrate concentraNons. The second eﬀect is that for every 
enzyme-substrate encounter, there is a higher probability that the enzyme will hydrolyze the 
substrate (with 𝑝'$($+,-.- =

/%"$0/&!!
; Fig. 5) rather than simply unbinding without acNng on the 
substrate (with probability 𝑝123.24 =
/&!!
/%"$0/&!!
).   
We can also use this analysis to interpret  the impaired mutant. Previous work suggested that  
residue W185 reorients upon producNve binding to PET and may contribute p-stacking 
interacNons with aromaNc groups in the PET substrate (6).  The W185A mutaNon was found to 
have reduced surface erosion acNvity on PET and a smaller  reducNon in PET crystallinity , 
compared to wild -type (6). First, it should be noted that, because we found that  𝜏#$-( for the 
impaired mutant was indisNnguishable from that for Qdots alone (Fig. 3C), the 𝑘"##

impaired mutant was considerably faster than Qdots alone (Fig. 3D) , which argues  that the 
impaired mutant is not totally inacNve. The simplest interpretaNon of the faster apparent oﬀ-rate 
is that the oﬀ-rate of the impaired mutant from the PET substrate is considerably faster than wild-
type. This eﬀect makes sense based on the proposed role of W185 in PET binding, and in bulk 
assays would lead to a larger KM.  Another way to describe the mutaNon is that for every binding 
encounter, the proba bility of a catalyNc event, 𝑝'$($+,-.- =
/%"$
/%"$0/&!!
 , is smaller, making the 
enzyme less producNve. 
 
Conclusion and future outlook 
We show here that single-molecule imaging can be used to deduce kineNc parameters of PETase 
enzymes. This approach provides a new tool that can be combined with exisNng bulk methods 
and computaNonal tools to engineer more acNve and robust PETases that address microplasNcs 
polluNon.  Further development of this single-molecule approach will require reducing the non-
speciﬁc adsorpNon that complicates interpretaNon of the kineNc data.  PotenNal soluNons include 
using probes other than Qdots to label the enzymes, improved processing of the PET substrate to 
reduce the autoﬂuorescence, and idenNfying surfactants or other alteraNons in buﬀer condiNons 
that minimize nonspeciﬁc binding.  Notably, more acNve enzymes that have higher kcat values are 
predicted to bind for shorter duraNons, and nonspeciﬁc Qdot binding currently limits the upper 
limit of apparent k oﬀ values that can be measured. One approach that has been explored for 
improving PETase funcNon is apaching a  Carbohydrate Binding Module (CBM)  or another 
hydrophobic domain to PETases to improve their PET binding aﬃniNes (19, 20).  If such a strategy 
is successful in creaNng a processive enzyme that diﬀuses along the surface while carrying out 
mulNple chain cleavage reacNons, this acNvity should be measurable as both a slower apparent 
oﬀ-rate of the enzyme measured by the cu rrent approach, as well as diﬀusive movements that 
could be detected by single -molecule tracking .  In conclusion, the methods developed here 
provide a new tool for screening engineered PETases with enhanced funcNons, which should 
contribute to mulNdisciplinary eﬀorts to use biocatalysts to reduce microplasNcs polluNon in the 
environment.

Experimental procedures 
Expression and puriﬁca?on of PETase enzymes 
DNA plasmids for wild -type PETase (PETase, I. sakaiensis , accession number: A0A0K8P6T7, 
Addgene number: #112202), hyperacNve mutant (Addgene number: #112203) and the impaired 
mutant (Addgene number: #112204) were purchased from Addgene.  Plasmids were transformed 
into E. coli C41(DE3) (Lucigen) and inoculated on a Nutrient Agar plate containing 100 μg/mL 
ampicillin (VWR; Cas: 69-52-3). Ager culturing overnight at 37°C, single colonies for each variant 
were inoculated into a started culture of 5 mL Terriﬁc Broth media (Thermo ScienNﬁc) containing 
100 μg/mL ampicillin and grown at 37°C overnight in a 180 rpm shaking incubator. Each starter 
culture was then transferred into 2 L ﬂasks with 400 mL media containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin 
and grown at 37°C at 200 rpm  unNl the opNcal density at 600 nm reached 0.6 -0.8. Protein 
expression was  induced by adding 1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (EMD 
Millipore Corp.; Cas: 367-93-1). Cells were then incubated for 18 to 20 hours at 20°C at 200 rpm, 
harvested by centrifugaNon at 5000 rpm for 20 min, and stored at -80°C for later puriﬁcaNon. 
Frozen cell pellets were resuspended in a lysis buﬀer (300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, 20 mM 
Tris HCl, pH 7.4,) and lysed by sonicaNon. Lysate was clariﬁed by centrifugaNon at 45,000 rpm for 
35 minutes. The supernatant was then applied to a 2 mL Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow (CyNva) column 
and eluted by eluNon buﬀer containing 300 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole, 20 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5. 
 
Microscopy and image analysis 
PET ﬁlm (Goodfellow, UK) was cleaned in puriﬁed water by sonicaNon, wiped with 100% ethanol, 
cut into pieces , and dissolved in triﬂuoroaceNc acid  (TFA) (Sigma Aldrich ; Cas: 76 -05-1) to a 
concentraNon of 1  wt%. 5-7 μL of PET soluNon was dripped onto a plasma cleaned coverslip, 
covered with a second cleaned coverslip, and the two coverslips were then separated and dried 
in air at room temperature for 30 min. Next, the coverslips were transferred to a 120°C oven for 
20 min to achieve a smooth PET coaNng , followed by  cooling at room temperature. Flow cells 
were assembled with the PET -coated coverslips using double-sided tape. The PET s urface was 
blocked to minimize nonspeciﬁc protein adsorpNon by ﬂowing 0.33 mg/mL casein into the ﬂow

cell for 3 min, followed by an enzyme soluNon consisNng of 8 nM wild-type PETase or its mutant 
labeled with 0.8 nM Qdot 655 (Thermo ScienNﬁc), 2 mM 2-Mercaptoethanol (Sigma-Aldrich; Cas: 
60-24-2), and 4 mM 4 -Nitrophenyl acetate (Sigma-Aldrich; Cas: 830-03-5) in a buﬀer containing 
100 mM NaCl and 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4. The Qdot655-labeled PETase was imaged by 
total internal reﬂecNon ﬂuorescence microscopy (TIRFM) using a 4 88 nm laser ( 70 mW or 150 
mW) on a custom-built microscope (15). Movies began immediately before the enzyme soluNon 
was added to the ﬂow cells. All experiments were performed at 22°C. The 10:1 enzyme:Qdot raNo 
was chosen because binding events were quite rare and lower raNos resulted in insuﬃcient 
parNcle counts to accurately calculate landing rate and duraNon parameters. 
PETase landing events and binding duraNons on the surface-immobilized PET ﬁlm were measured 
by Kymograph analysis in ImageJ, as follows.  Image stacks consist of a cube of x-y images at 
sequenNal Nmes, t.  First, the “Reslice” command was used to generate mulNple x-t (horizontal) 
slices at varying y (verNcal).  The “Output spacing” was set to 5 pixels, which corresponds to the 
~300 nm full width at half maximum of the point spread funcNon of our microscope (15).  Next, 
the “Grouped z projecNon” command was used to compress the mulNple slices along the y axis 
into a single x-t image (see Fig. 1). From this kymograph, the binding duraNons are measured by 
the length of the verNcal lines, where one pixel equals one frame, and the landing rate is 
measured by counNng the total number of events throughout the enNre movie. This approach of 
generaNng an  x-t Kymograph is similar in principle  to the approach of Pepersson et al  (21).  
Binding duraNon distribuNons were ﬁt to biexponenNals in Python 3.9.19 using the ‘scipy.opNmize’ 
library.
