ABSTRACT: An aminotransferaseω-TAEn was identiﬁed fromEnhydrobacter aerosaccus. Theω-TAEn was successfully expressed
in Escherichia coliand the obtained enzyme showed activity towardβ-phenylalanine (β-phe) at optimal conditions. For optically pure
(R)-β-phe, 50% yield was observed by kinetic resolution of racemic amino with pyruvate as the amino acceptor. To obtain (S)-β-
phe, the lipase/ω-TAEn catalytic system was adopted. The ω-TAEn showed strict stereoselectivity to the amino donor. The
formation of (S)-β-phe was observed using 3-aminobutyric acid as the amino donor, and (S)-β-phe was obtained by asymmetric
synthesis with a yield of 82%.
1. INTRODUCTION
β-Amino acids are very important chiral compounds for the
synthesis of some physiologically active compounds such as
peptides, peptidomimetics.1,2 Meanwhile, β-amino acids are
interesting nonprotein amino acids since the β-amino acid
peptide bonds show high stability toward protease hydrolysis,
making it available for biochemical research.
3,4 β-Phenylalanine
(β-phe) is an important chiral building block for the synthesis
of various pharmaceuticals, such as the antidiabetic compound
sitagliptin and the anticancer drug taxol, which form the chiral
center of these chiral drugs.5,6 It is worth mentioning that the
enantiomerically purity of the compound has important eﬀects
on pharmacological activity.
Until now, methods for obtaining enantiomerically pureβ-
amino acids are divided into chemical synthesis, physical

organocatalysis have been used for chemical synthesis, while
expensive equipment is needed in physical separation. 7 By
contrast, enzymatic catalysis attracts more attention due to the
simplicity in inserting chirality and selectivity with regard to
regio- and stereochemistry in molecules.8 Diﬀerent enzymes
and various strategies have been employed to get β-amino
acid.9−15 Among these methods, ω-transaminase (ω-TA) is
one of the most prominent approaches due to high
stereoselectivity and self-regenerating cofactors.16,17 Further-
more, theω-TA can be applied to kinetic resolution of racemic
amino acids or asymmetric synthesis of optically pure
amines.
18,19 Although some excellent ω-TAs have been
reported, only a few have showed the activity to aromaticβ-
amino acids. Some novel ω-TAs have been reported most
recently; however, the asymmetric synthesis ofβ-phe by these
enzymes showed a low conversion.20−22 In this study, a newω-
TA was explored and named ω-TAEn, which was cloned,
expressed, and characterized. Meanwhile, (S)-β-phe and (R)-β-
phe were respectively obtained by using theω-TAEn.
2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
2.1. Selection of the ω-TA Gene. A candidate protein
sequence (UniPort entry UPI000A2F0B05) from Enhydro-
bacter aerosaccus (ω-TAEn), which encodes 498 amino acids,
was used for the transamination to (S)-β-phe. ω-TAEn has a
high degree of homology with previously reportedω-TAs from

Mesorhizobium sp. LUK (52.45% identity), Variovorax para-
doxus (52.4% identity), and Burkholderia graminis (54.02%
identity) that can catalyze the ammonia transfer reaction of
aromatic amino acid.
20,23,24 To reconﬁrm the feature of ω-
TAEn, the protein sequence was aligned withω-transaminase
from Mesorhizobium sp. strain LUK . K332 is where the
cofactor PLP is reversibly bound to the enzyme through a
Schiﬀ-base linkage, and the chemical binding site of pyridoxal
5′-phosphate binding pocket (G191, T192, N195, E272, D305,
M308, and G331) is also conserved in the new protein
sequence.
21 Since the sequence of ω-TAEn is only 50%
identical compared to other sequences, in addition to the
conserved sequence ofω-TA, diﬀerences in other amino acid
positions may cause its unique catalytic properties. To express
the ω-TAEn, the artiﬁcial gene was optimized with an N-
terminal His-tag sequence in consideration of codon usage
pattern in Escherichia coli cells.
2.2. Expression and Puriﬁcation of theω-TA. The ω-
TAEn, mainly presented as a soluble protein, was expressed in
E. coli BL21(DE3) and isolated from the crude cell extracts.
Then, the ω-TAEn was conﬁrmed by SDS-PAGE (see the
Supporting Information). SDS-PAGE showed a single band
between 46 and 58 kDa.
2.3. Eﬀect of Temperature and pH. The e ﬀect of
temperature and pH onω-TAEn activity was examined, and
the results are shown inFigure 1. The maximum activity was
observed between 50 and 55 °C. The activity of ω-TAEn
decreased sharply when the temperature was above 55°C, and
the relative activity at 65°C dropped to 17% of that at 50°C.
The eﬀect of pH onω-TAEn was investigated at 50°C, and
the maximum reaction rate was observed at pH 8.0. This
means thatω-TAEn preferred weak alkaline conditions, which
is consistent with most ω-TAs that have been reported.
24,25
This might be due to easier formation of the imine structure
between the PLP and the enzyme at an alkaline environment.
ω-TAEn showed diﬀerent catalytic eﬃciencies at pH 8.0 in
diﬀerent reaction buﬀers, which was also observed onω-TA
from B. graminis. Unlike reported cases, ω-TAEn was more
sensitive to pH as no catalytic activity was detected at pH 7.5
in Tris−HCl buﬀer.
2.4. E ﬀect of Organic Solvent and Metal Ion.
Considering the addition of the solvent in the industrial
catalysis, the eﬀect of organic solvent on the enzyme activity
was examined (Figure 2). Methyl alcohol inhibited the enzyme
activity more obviously, and 20% methanol caused over 80%
activity loss. DMSO was gentler on the ω-TAEn. Hence,
DMSO is a more suitable solvent for the production of chiral
amines due to the poor solubility of the prochirality substrate
in water.
The eﬀect of six diﬀerent metal ions on the enzyme was also
investigated. The ω-TAEn shows a higher catalytic activity
when it coexists with Ca
2+ or Mg2+ ions. The metal ions Cu2+
and Zn2+ obviously inhibited the relative activities. The relative
activity with addition of Zn2+ was less than a ﬁfth of the
control. The results indicated that heavy metal ions could be
the inhibitors of theω-TAEn. Previously, Gao et al. reported a
new (R)-selective amine transaminase from Fusarium oxy-
sporum that can be promoted by Zn
2+ and Fe3+ while being
inhibited by Mg2+,26 which seems like the same metal ion has
an opposite eﬀect on diﬀerent selective enzymes.
2.5. Enzymatic Thermal Stability.The eﬀect of temper-
ature on stability of theω-TAEn was investigated (Figure 3).
ω-TAEn was stable after 10 min of incubation at 55°C, while
it only displayed 33% of the maximum activity at 65°C. On
the whole, ω-TAEn preferred a mild reaction condition. The
interesting thing is that, when diﬀerent reactants are added to
the incubation process, ω-TAEn shows di ﬀerent thermal
stabilities. At 55°C, ω-TAEn shows reasonable stability while
being incubated with PLP and pyruvic acid, and very weak
catalysis with PLP andβ-phe, otherwise, almost inactivated it
after incubation. It seems that the PLP and pyruvic acid protect
the enzyme from heat damage. Cerioli et al. conﬁrmed that the
additives can a ﬀect the enzyme storage stability.
27 This
phenomenon is presumed to be due to the protection of
active sites by PLP and pyruvic acid.
2.6. Kinetic Parameters of ω-TAEn. To determine the
kinetic parameters of ω-TAEn, the initial reaction rate was
detected (Figure 4). K
m and Kcat values ofω-TAEn toβ-phe in
the presence of 10 mM pyruvate were 0.70 mM and 24.15
min−1, respectively. The relative smallerKm value of ω-TAEn
than those of many otherω-TAs suggests that this enzyme has
a more promising potential for industrial applications. 28,29
When the substrate reached 4 mM, the inhibition eﬀect was
observed. This was consistent with theω-transaminase from
Mesorhizobium sp. strain LUK, while the substrate inhibition

solvent, 20 mMrac-β-phe, and 20 mM pyruvate.

constant of 3.2 mM was observed in the presence of 10 mM
pyruvate.20
2.7. Chiral Resolution of rac-β-Phe. To establish the
method for obtaining optically pureβ-phe, ω-TAEn was used
to get (R)-β-phe by chiral resolution ofrac-β-phe. rac-β-Phe
(10 mM) was completely resolved into (R)-β-phe (ee > 99) by
ω-TAEn with 20 mM pyruvic acid as the amino acceptor
during 4 h of incubation (Figure 5). The new ω-TAEn can
withstand a higher catalytic temperature, which makes it more
suitable to the industrial processes.
2.8. Asymmetric Synthesis of (S)-β-Phe. For asymmetric
synthesis of (S)-β-phe, DMSO was added to increase the
solubility of the substrate. The main obstacle to asymmetric
synthesis of (S)-β-phe is its substrate β-phenylpyruvic acid,
which is unstable due to the decarboxylation to produce
acetophenone. Considering the stability of the substrate, the
asymmetric synthesis process was carried out at 37 °C.
Summarizing the previous research studies,
L-alanine is
commonly used as the amino donor for asymmetric syn-
thesis.20,30 The production of β-phe was not detected when
using L-alanine as the amino donor, which could be due to the
low activity. ω-TAEn can catalyze the formation of 2.7 mM
(0.45 g/L) optically pure β-phe with 3-aminobutyric acid as
the amino donor. It is diﬃcult to have a precise quantiﬁcation
of the conversion, but we had measured acetophenone, the by-
product, up to 4.08 mM (0.49 g/L) after 10 h.
Kim et al. combined lipase and ω-TA using ethyl
benzoylacetate as an indirect substrate to reduce the loss due
to decarboxylation, but theω-TA showed a low conversion.
20
Then, we attempted to take this strategy. The lipase from
Candida rugosa was used to hydrolyze ethyl phenylpyruvate.
We tried to ﬁnd out if the temperature can promote the
reaction process because theω-TA showed the highest activity
at 50°C. The results shows that, after 12 h of incubation, 2.74
mM (0.54 g/L) (S)-β-phe was obtained at 37°C, at least 5-
folds than that at 55 °C. The high temperature caused the
increases in decomposition rate of the β-phe, although it
lowered the hydrolysis rate of lipase. The maximum output of

buﬀer (pH 8.0), and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 5 min.

(S)-β-phe was obtained up to 0.61 g/L at 12 h with the
combination of lipase (1 mg/mL) andω-TAEn (0.09 mg/mL)
(Figure 6). The conversion rate was 40%.
Based on previous research studies, it seems that the amino
donor makes a huge contribution to the conversion rate.29 To
get higher yields, diﬀerent kinds of amino compounds were
tried as an alternative to 3-aminobutyric acid. According to a
previous research study, nine commonly used compounds
containing ﬁve rac-amino acids (
DL-3-aminobutyric acid, DL-
serine, DL-valine, DL-norleucine, andDL-glutamic acid) and four
achirality amines (isopropamide, glycine,γ-aminobutyric acid,
and benzylamine) were carried out with ethyl phenylpyruvate
(10 mM).
31 The (S)-β-phe was not detected while utilizingL-
3-aminobutyric acid or other compounds as the amino donor,
which rea ﬃr m st h a ti d e at h a tt h eω-TAEn has high
stereoselectivity to the substrate. A similar result was shown
on ω-TA from Mesorhizobium sp. strain LUK. Previously,
Mathew et al. increased the output by increasing the
concentration of the amino donor ((S)-α-methylbenzylamine),
but 100 mM of the amino donor inhibited the generation of
products.
28 Then, the concentration of the amino donor was
adjusted from 30 to 600 mM with 10 mM ethyl phenyl-
pyruvate (see the Supporting Information). As expected, the
increase in amino donor concentration had a direct impact on
the production of (S)-β-phe. Diﬀerent from the reports, the
enzyme’s inhibition toward the amino donor was not observed
when utilizing 3-aminobutyric acid. The yield was up to 82%
(Table 1), which was three times higher than the earlier report
(20% yield from the 10 mM substrate).

3. CONCLUSIONS
In this study, a candidate protein sequence fromE. aerosaccus
was obtained through gene mining, the corresponding gene
sequence was optimized and expressed in E. coli, and the
acquired protein was biochemically characterized. The enzyme
assays revealed the aminotransferase activity toβ-amino acids,
and the novelω-TA showed high stereoselectivity and activity
toward ( S)-β-phe. Consistent with previous reports, the
enzyme prefers alkaline environments, and the optimum
temperature is about 50 °C. In this optimal condition, 10
mM rac-β-phe was successfully dissected asymmetrically to
produce enantiomeric pure (R)-β-phe in the presence of an
excess amount of amino acceptor within 4 h. In the resolution
reaction, the generatedβ-phenylpyruvic acid decomposes itself
under the reaction conditions, which promotes the normal
progress of the reaction to obtain a high conversion rate. The
asymmetric synthesis of enantiomeric pure (S)-β-phe was also
performed utilizing the enzyme, and 0.91 g/L (S)-β-phe was
synthesized from ethyl phenylpyruvate (10 mM) with 82%
conversion rate by the way in which theω-TA was linked to
the lipase. Two reasons lead to the higher product yields: one
is that the higher amino donor concentration promotes the
forward direction of the reaction, and the other is due to the
reduction of β-phenylpyruvic acid loss. In summary, the novel
ω-TA can act as a valuable enzyme for the kinetic resolution of
racemic β-phe and the asymmetric synthesis of (S)-β-phe.

were obtained from commercial corporations (Sigma-Aldrich,
Aladdin, Adamas, etc.). E. coli DH5α and BL21(DE3) were
used as the hosts of cloning and heterologous expression.
Plasmid pETDuet-1 was used as the expression vector.
4.2. Selection of the ω-TA Gene. The ω-TAPo from
Polaromonas sp. JS666, which has been reported for showing
activity toward aromatic β-amino acid, was used as the
template to ﬁnd new ω-TAs.
29 According to the BLASTP
search in NCBI ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) , a new
protein sequence (WP_085935911.1) from E. aerosaccus
(Strain ATCC 27094), which showed 86% similarity and
56% identity to the ω-TAPo, was selected as the candidate
protein.
4.3. Construction of Plasmid and Expression of ω-
TAs. The optimized gene sequence was synthesized by the
Beijing Genomics Institute with pUC57 (pUC57- ω-TAEn)
between theBamHI andHindIII restriction sites. The purpose
gene was connected to pETDuet-1 with the corresponding
sites to form the gene expression vector. The plasmids were
transformed into E. coli BL21, and the cultivated strain was
screened by colony PCR using primers pETUP1
(ATGCGTCCGGCGTAGA) and T7-Terminator
(ATGCGTCCGGCGTAGA).
The resulting strains were cultured in the LB culture
medium. When the OD
600 reached about 0.6−0.8, ITPG (0.6
mM) was added. After 8 h of induced expression at 30°C, the
cells were harvested at 5000 rpm for 5 min at 4 °C. Cell
fragmentation was achieved by constant cell disruption systems
(Constant Systems) at 30 kpsi. The supernatant was puriﬁed
on a Ni-NTA agarose resin obtained from Beyotime
Biotechnology.
4.4. Enzyme Assays.The reaction system for detecting the
speciﬁc activity of theω-TA was composed of 1 mL of Tris−
HCl buﬀer (0.1 M, pH 8.0) at 30°C containing PLP (0.1
mM), rac-β-phe (10 mM), pyruvate (20 mM), and enzyme
(0.025 mg/mL). The enzyme assay was stopped after 50 min
by a water bath at 95 °C. The evaluation of enzymatic
reactions was achieved by testing the generated alanine or
consumed β-phe. All these experiments were done in triplicate.
4.5. Eﬀect of Temperature, pH, Organic Solvent, and
Metal Ion. To explore the impact of temperature, pH, and
organic solvents on theω-TA, an enzyme assay was carried out
at various temperatures from 0 °C (ice bath) to 60 °C, in
diﬀerent pH buﬀers (phosphate buﬀer, pH 6−8; Tris−HCl
buﬀer, pH 7.5−9), and at diﬀerent organic solvent environ-
ments (methyl alcohol and dimethyl sulfoxide). To analyze the
eﬀect of metal ions onω-TA, diﬀerent kinds of metal ions (1
mM) were added to the reaction system. Relative activity of
100% is deﬁned as the highest rate of alanine formation under
each condition to be optimized.
4.6. Enzymatic Thermal Stability. To investigate the
thermal stability of ω-TA, the enzyme was incubated at a
speciﬁc temperature (45, 55, and 65°C) for 10 min. Then, 10
mM rac-β-phe was added to start the reaction. The remaining
activity was determined 50 min later.
4.7. Kinetic Resolution of Racemic Amines.For kinetic
resolution of racemic amines, the enzyme assay was carried out
in 1 mL of Tris−HCl buﬀ
er containing 10 mM pyruvate as the
amino acceptor and 0.1 mM PLP, and the initial rates were
detected at various substrate concentrations from 0.5 to 4 mM.
4.8. Chiral Synthesis of (S)-β-Phe. To investigate the
ability to synthesize asymmetricalβ-phe, β-phenylpyruvic acid,
the direct substrate of ω-TA, was obtained from ethyl
phenylpyruvate (see theSupporting Information). Asymmetric
synthesis of ( S)-β-phe was also carried out through a
combination of lipase andω-TA. Lipase (1 mg/mL) andω-
TA (0.045 mg/mL) were added in 1 mL of Tris−HCl buﬀer
containing ethyl phenylpyruvate (10 mM), PLP (0.1 mM),
amino donor, and 5% DMSO as the cosolvent. The enzyme
assay was carried out at 50 and 37°C for 12 h, and generation
of β-phe was detected.
4.9. Analytical Conditions. The β-phe was detected by
HPLC using a Crownpak CR-I column (3 mm× 150 mm,
Daicel Co., Japan) at 210 nm with isocratic elution of
perchloric acid solution (pH 1)/methanol (20/80, v/v) at 0.1
mL/min. The alanine was detected using an OA-5000 column
(4.6 mm × 150 mm, SUMICHIRAL Co., Japan) at 245 nm
with an elution of copper sulfate solution (2 mM)/acetonitrile
(90/10, v/v) at 1 mL/min. All HPLC detections were carried
out at room temperature.
