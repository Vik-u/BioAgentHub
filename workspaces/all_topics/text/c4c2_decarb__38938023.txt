Objective: This study aimed to determine the effects of compatibility of Clostridium 
butyricum and Bacillus subtilis on growth performance, lipid metabolism, antioxidant 
status and cecal microflora of broilers during the starter phase.
Methods: A total of 600 1-day-old Ross 308 broilers were randomly divided into two groups 
with six replicates in each group. Chickens in the control group were fed a basal diet, while 
chickens in the experimental group were fed a diet supplemented with 2×10
8
 colony forming 
units (CFU)/kg of C. butyricum and 1×10
9
 CFU/kg of B. subtilis. The experimental period 
was 21 days.
Results: Addition of C. butyricum and B. subtilis significantly increased (p<0.05) the body 
weight and liver nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-malic enzyme (NADP-ME) 
activity of broilers, enhanced (p<0.05) the average daily gain and average daily feed intake of 
broilers. However, the addition of C. butyricum and B. subtilis did not significantly affect the 
concen trations of triglyceride and total cholesterol in the serum, the activities of fatty acid 
synthase and acetyl–CoA carboxylase in the liver, the total antioxidant capacity, glutathione 
peroxidase activity and malondialdehyde content in the serum and liver. Besides, microbial 
analysis revealed that supplementation of C. butyricum and B. subtilis increased (p<0.05) 
the abundance of Firmicutes such as CHKCI001 and Faecalibacterium, decreased (p<0.05) 
the abundance of Bacteroidota such as Bacteroides and Alistipes. Spearman correlation 
analysis confirmed that the above cecal microbiota were closely related to the growth 
performance of broilers (p<0.05). In addition, simultaneous supplementation of C. butyricum 
and B. subtilis significant affected (p<0.05) 33 different functional pathways such as lipid 
metabolism and carbohydrate metabolism. This explains the phenomenon of increased 
growth performance and liver NADP-ME activity in the probiotics group.
Conclusion: The compatibility of C. butyricum and B. subtilis could improve the growth of 
broilers during the starter phase by changing the cecal microflora.

INTRODUCTION
Poultry's digestive tract contains many microorganisms that play an important role in 
maintaining the relative stability of intestinal environment and enhancing digestion and 
absorption [1]. In recent years, studies have shown that some changes in poultry intestinal 
microorganisms can have an impact on the antioxidant capacity of poultry through the 
nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) signaling pathway [2]. In addition, the

relative abundance of microorganisms in the poultry intestine, 
especially the dominant phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes, 
can be linked to the body weight (BW) and lipid metabolism 
of poultry through the circulating factor angiopoietin-like 
protein 4 (ANGPTL4) [3,4]. Therefore, improving the intes-
tinal microorganisms of poultry is of great significance for 
improving their antioxidant capacity and growth performance. 
At present, there are many ways to change the intestinal micro-
organisms of poultry, among which exogenous probiotics is 
one of the more effective methods.
 Clostridium butyricum is an anaerobic gram-positive bac-
terium, which is characterized by production of butyric acid 
[5]. Bacillus subtilis is aerobic in nature [6,7], but under anaero-
bic conditions, they can utilize nitrate or nitrite as the terminal 
electron acceptor to facilitate anaerobic respiration [8]. These 
two probiotics, which belong to Firmicutes, have been ap-
proved as feed additives for broilers (Announcement No. 
2045 of the Ministry of Agriculture of the People's Republic 
of China). Since both C. butyricum and B. subtilis can pro-
duce spores, the two probiotics have strong resistance to the 
external environment, and have strong tolerance to high 
temperature and high pressure in the feed processing process, 
as well as to gastric acid and bile acid of animals [7,9]. Studies 
have shown that C. butyricum and B. subtilis can improve 
the growth performance and modify the intestinal microbial 
composition of broilers [3,10], but there are few studies on 
the compatibility of these two probiotics in broilers produc-
tion. As mentioned above, B. subtilis is an aerobic bacterium, 
which can consume oxygen in the intestinal tract after being 
eaten by broilers, which will provide powerful conditions for 
the reproduction and growth of C. butyricum, so the com-
patibility of C. butyricum and B. subtilis will theoretically 
play a synergistic role. The starter phase of broilers is an im-
portant period for the gradual establishment and improvement 
of the intestinal microflora of broilers. During this period, 
the intestinal microflora of broilers is often greatly affected 
by external factors [11,12]. Therefore, this study explored the 
effects of compatibility of C. butyricum and B. subtilis on 
growth performance, lipid metabolism, antioxidant status 
and cecal microflora of broilers during the starter phase.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animal care
The animal care and use protocol was approved by the Ethics 
Committee of Linyi University (Linyi, Shandong, China) 
(20200107).
Birds and treatments
Six hundred healthy one-day-old Ross 308 broilers with 
similar BW (40.50±0.15; purchased from Shandong Minhe 
Animal Husbandry Co., Ltd., Shandong, China) were ran-
domly divided into two groups with six replicates per group 
and 50 broilers per replicate. Broilers in the control group 
were fed the basal diet (composition and nutrient levels as 
shown in Table 1) formulated according to the nutritional 
recommendation of National Research Council [13]. Chickens 
in the experimental group were given the basal diet supple-
mented with 2×10
8
 colony forming units (CFU)/kg of C. 
butyricum and 1×10
9
 CFU/kg of B. subtilis (provided by 
Shandong Hongde Agriculture and Animal Husbandry 
Technology Co., Ltd., the added dosage of the two probiotics 
is the recommended dosage given by the provider based on 
previous practical experience, and the data are unpublished). 
The strains of C. butyricum and B. subtilis used in this study 
were C. butyricum HJCB998 (CGMCC 9386) and B. subtilis 
HJBA058 (CGMCC 9383), respectively. The diets for both 
groups were pellet form. The contents of crude protein, cal-
cium, total phosphorus and amino acid in diet were determined 
according to China national standards GB/T 6432-2018, GB/T 
6436-2018, GB/T 6437-2018, and GB/T 18246-2019, respec-
tively. The experimental broilers were raised in three-layer 
cages with free access to feed and water ([100×80] cm
2
 floor 
space, 10 broilers in each cage), and raise according to the 
Table 1. Composition and nutrient levels of basal diet (air-dry basis,

normal feeding and management mode. The temperature 
was maintained at 34°C±1°C in the first three days, and then 
decreased by 1°C every 2 to 3 days until the broilers were 21 
days of age. The humidity was maintained at 60% to 65% in 
the first week and 55% to 60% thereafter. In the first two 
days, 24 hours of light were provided every day, followed 
by a schedule of 23 hours of light and 1 hour of darkness 
per day. The broilers used in this experiment were raised in 
Wangnong Breeding Co., Ltd. (Junan, Linyi, Shandong, 
China). The experimental period was 21 days.
Sample collection
One healthy broiler (with a BW close to the average weight 
of the broilers in the replicate) from each replicate that had 
been fasting for 12 h was selected to take blood samples 
from the wing vein at the end of the experiment (the broilers 
was 21 days of age at this time). Serum was then separated 
for detection of serum lipids and antioxidant status related 
indicators. Afterwards, the same broilers were then eutha-
nized by arterial exsanguination under deep anesthesia after 
feeding for 2 h. Liver samples from the same part on the left 
side were isolated and stored at –20°C for the detection of 
the lipid synthesis-related enzyme activities and the antioxi-
dant status related indicators. The contents of the left cecum 
were collected in 7 mL sterilized centrifuge tubes and stored 
at –80°C after quick freezing with liquid nitrogen for detec-
tion of cecal microflora.
Measurement of growth performance
During the experiment, the feed intake, initial and final BW 
and health status of the broilers in each replicate were re-
corded, and the average daily feed intake (ADFI), average 
daily gain (ADG), and feed conversion rate (FCR) of the 
control group and the experimental group were calculated.
Determination of triglyceride and total cholesterol in 
the serum and antioxidant status in the serum and liver
The contents of triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) 
in the serum, the total protein content in the liver, as well as 
the total antioxidant capacity (T-AOC), glutathione peroxidase 
(GSH-Px) activity, and malondialdehyde (MDA) content in 
the serum and liver were determined using the correspond-
ing kits from Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute 
(Nanjing, Jiangsu, China). Among these indicators, liver T-
AOC and MDA content were measured using 10% liver 
tissue homogenate supernatant, liver GSH-Px activity was 
measured using 6.67% liver tissue homogenate supernatant, 
and liver total protein content was measured using 1% liver 
tissue homogenate supernatant. The serum GSH-Px activity 
was measured using 10-fold diluted serum, and the remain-
ing serum-related indicators were measured using undiluted 
serum. The determination method was the same as the kit 
instruction.
Lipid synthesis-related enzyme activity assays
The activities of fatty acid synthase (FAS), NADP-malic enzyme 
(NADP-ME), acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC) and content of 
total protein in the liver were determined by the correspond-
ing kits produced by Suzhou Comin Biotechnology Co., Ltd. 
(Suzhou, Jiangsu, China). The preparation methods of liver 
tissue homogenates and the determination methods of the 
above indexes were consistent with the instructions of the 
corresponding kits.
Cecal microflora assays
The cecal microflora was determined by 16S rDNA amplicon 
sequencing, and the library was paired-ended sequenced by 
Beijing Novogene Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China) based 
on the illumina NovaSeq sequencing platform. The specific 
operation process was the same as that described by Li et al 
[14]. After sequencing, paired-end reads were processed by 
merging, data filtration and chimera removal to obtain the 
effective tags [15]. Then, the effective tags were denoised (using 
the DADA2 module in the QIIME2 software [QIIME2-202006 
version]), and the sequences with abundance less than 5 were 
filtered out to obtain the Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs). 
Next, species annotation was performed on each ASV using 
the classify-sklearn module in the QIIME2 software (Silva 
Database), and according to the results of species annotation, 
the top 10 species with the highest abundance at the phylum 
and genus levels in each group were selected to generate a 
species relative abundance column cumulative graph to in-
tuitively view the species with higher relative abundance and 
their proportions at the phylum and genus levels in each 
group of samples. Alpha diversity such as chao1, observed_
otus, shannon and simpson was calculated with QIIME2 
(using t-test). For beta diversity analysis, the principal co-
ordinates analysis (PCoA) based on weighted UniFrac distances 
result was displayed using ade4 package and ggplot2 package 
in R software (Version 2.15.3). In addition, the microbial 
differences between the two groups were measured by linear 
discriminant analysis (LDA) effect size (LEfSe) (Version 
1.0, https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/galaxy/)(LDA>4, 
p<0.05) [16]. The correlation between growth performance 
and microbial species richness was analyzed using Spearman 
correlation analysis. The functional pathways prediction of 
cecal flora was inferred using Tax4Fun, the specific steps 
are consistent with those described by Cheng et al [17].
Statistical analysis
The independent sample t-test was carried out on the data 
by SAS9.2 statistical software (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, 
USA). The results were expressed as mean±standard error. 
Statistical significance is defined when p values are less than

RESULTS
Growth performance
The BW , ADG, and ADFI of broiler chickens fed a diet sup-
plemented with C. butyricum and B. subtilis were significantly 
higher (p<0.05) than those of the control group (Table 2). 
However, no difference was observed in FCR between con-
trol and C. butyricum and B. subtilis-supplemented group 
birds.
Serum lipid
The contents of TG and TC in the serum of broilers in bac-
teria addition group were not significantly different from 
those in control group (Table 3).
Lipid synthesis-related enzyme activity
The activity of NADP-ME in the liver of broilers in the pro-
biotic supplemented group was significantly higher (p<0.05) 
than that in the control group, but the activities of FAS and 
ACC were not significantly different from those in the con-
trol group (Table 4).
Antioxidant status
The indexes of T-AOC, GSH-Px, and MDA in the serum 
and liver of broilers supplemented with probiotics were not 
significantly different from those of the control group (Table 5).
Diversity of cecal microbiota
Alpha diversity: The Shannon and Simpson index of broilers 
added with C. butyricum and B. subtilis were significantly 
lower (p<0.05) than those of the control group (Table 6). 
However, the Chao1 and Observed_otus of broilers added 
with C. butyricum and B. subtilis were not significantly dif-
ferent from those of the control group.
 Beta diversity: The PCoA based on weighted UniFrac dis-
tances revealed clear clustering of cecal microflora between 
the probiotic group and the control group (Figure 1). 
Variation in cecal microbiota composition
Firmicutes and Bacteroidota were the dominant phyla in the 
cecal microbiota of 21-day-old broilers, accounting for nearly 
90% of the phylum in the cecal microbiota (Figure 2A). Bac-
teroides, CHKCI001, Clostridia vadinBB60 group, Alistipes, 
and Faecalibacterium accounted for more than 50% of the 
genera in the cecal microbiota of 21-day-old broilers (Figure 
2B).
 The LEfSe analysis identified 18 biomarkers (Figure 3). 
Among them, six bacterial taxa were enriched in broilers in 
the C. butyricum and B. subtilis-supplemented group, in-
cluding Lachnospiraceae (family), Lachnospirales (order), 
CHKCI001 (genus), Firmicutes (phylum), Clostridia (class), 
and Faecalibacterium (genus). Moreover, Bacteroides clarus 
(species), Clostridia vadinBB60 group (family), Clostridia 
vadinBB60 group (genus), Clostridia vadinBB60 group (order), 
Oscillospiraceae (family), Rikenellaceae (family), Alistipes 
(genus), Bacteroides (genus), Bacteroidaceae (family), Bac-
teroidia (class), Bacteroidota (phylum), Bacteroidales (order)

were enriched in the Control group.
Correlation of cecal microbiota and growth 
performance
The abundance of Firmicutes (phylum), CHKCI001 (genus), 
Faecalibacterium (genus), and Lactobacillus (genus) were all 
positively correlated with BW , ADFI and ADG, whereas the 
abundance of Bacteroidota (phylum), Bacteroides (genus), 
Alistipes (genus), and Intestinimonas (genus) were all nega-
tively correlated with BW , ADFI, and ADG, respectively 
(Figure 4A, 4B). Besides, the abundance of Clostridia vadin-
BB60 group (genus) was negatively correlated with ADFI of 
broilers during the starter phase (Figure 4B).

DISCUSSION
Compatibility of Clostridium butyricum and Bacillus 
subtilis on growth performance of broilers
Body weight, ADG, ADFI, and FCR are commonly used 
indicators to reflect the growth performance of poultry. 
Nowadays, research on the effect of C. butyricum and B. sub-
tilis on the growth performance of broilers is mostly focused 
on the role of single bacterium, while the research on the effect 
of compatibility of the two bacteria is rare. Yu et al [18] found 
that addition of 1×10
9
 CFU/kg of C. butyricum had no sig-
nificant effect on the ADG, ADFI, and FCR of Cobb broilers 
during the starter phase. However, Takahashi et al [5] reported 
that dietary addition of 2.5×10

increased the ADG of starter broilers (1 to 28 days), but had 
no significant effect on the ADFI and FCR of broilers at this 
stage. Similarly, Mohamed et al [19] also observed that sup-
plementation of 5×10
8
 CFU/kg of B. subtilis ATCC19659 
significantly increased the BW of 21-day-old AA broilers 
and increased the ADG of broilers during the starter phase, 
but the ADFI and FCR of broilers at this stage were not affect-
ed. However, Wang et al [20] and Xu et al [21] respectively 
reported that adding 1×10
9
 CFU/kg of B. subtilis DSM29784 
to diet did not affect the growth performance of Lingnan 
yellow broilers at the 1 to 21 day age stage, and adding 1.5×10
9
 
CFU/kg of B. subtilis to diet also did not affect the growth 
performance of male Cobb 500 broilers during the starter 
phase. The results of this study showed that addition of 
2×10
8
 CFU/kg of C. butyricum  and 1×10
9
 CFU/kg of B. 
subtilis in diet significantly increased the BW of 21-day-old 
Ross 308 broilers, and enhanced the ADG and ADFI of 
starter broilers, but the FCR of broilers at this stage were 
not affected. Comparing the results of this experiment with 
those of previous studies, it was found that for the indicator 
of BW , the results of this experiment were consistent with 
the results of Ma et al [1] and Mohamed et al [19] (probiotics 
improved BW), but inconsistent with the results of Wang 
et al [20] and Xu et al [21] (probiotics had no effect on 
BW). Regarding the indicator of ADG, the results of this 
study were consistent with the results of Takahashi et al [5], 
Ma et al [1], and Mohamed et al [19] (probiotics increased 
ADG), but inconsistent with the results of Yu et al [18], Wang 
et al [20], and Xu et al [21] (probiotics had no effect on ADG). 
Regarding the indicator of ADFI, the results of this study 
were consistent only with the results of Takahashi et al [5] 
(probiotics increased ADFI), but inconsistent with the results 
of Yu et al [18], Ma et al [1], Mohamed et al [19], Wang et al 
[20], and Xu et al [21] (probiotics had no effect on ADFI). 
Regarding the indicator of FCR, the results of this study were 
consistent with all the studies (probiotics had no effect on 
FCR) except Takahashi et al [5] (probiotics decreased FCR). 
The discrepancy among these studies may be related to the 
differences in broiler breeds and ages, the types (including 
whether two probiotics were added simultaneously) and 
amounts of probiotics used, feeding management levels, and 
diet compositions in each study. The improved growth per-
formance of broilers in the probiotic group observed in this 
experiment may be related to the following two aspects: on 
the one hand, C. butyricum or B. subtilis produced beneficial 
metabolites, such as butyric acid, vitamin B, digestive enzymes, 
etc., which promoted the digestion and absorption of nutrients 
[2,21]; on the other hand, the addition of C. butyricum and B. 
subtilis promoted the healthy intestinal microecological envi-
ronment and improved the immunity of broilers [22,23].
Compatibility of Clostridium butyricum and Bacillus 
subtilis on serum lipid of broilers
The lipids synthesized by the broiler liver need to be trans-
ported to other tissues through the blood, so the blood lipid 
content can reflect the metabolism of lipids in the body [24]. 
In this study, the concentrations of TG and TC in the serum 
of broilers in the probiotic group had no significant changes, 
indicating that the simultaneous addition of C. butyricum 
and B. subtilis had no effect on the stability of lipid metabolism 
in broilers under the conditions of this experiment. The ho-
meostatic mechanism existing in broilers may be responsible 
for this result, but it needs to be further verified.
 At present, the research on the effects of C. butyricum and 
B. subtilis on serum lipid in broilers mostly focused on the 
role of a single bacterium, but the research on the effects of 
compatibility was lacking. Liao et al [9] and Zhao et al [4] 
reported that both 2.5×10
8
 CFU/kg and 5×10
8
 CFU/kg 
supplementation levels of C. butyricum had no effect on 
the contents of TG and TC in the serum of 21-day-old male 
AA broiler chickens. However, Mohamed et al [6] showed 
that dietary supplementation of 5×10
8
 CFU/g of B. subtilis 
ATCC19659 significantly reduced the concentrations of 
TG and TC in the serum of 21-day-old AA broiler chickens, 
and pointed out the reason for this phenomenon may be 
that the addition of B. subtilis promotes the excretion of 
lipids from broiler feces and reduces the synthesis of lipids 
by inhibiting the lipid synthesis-related enzyme activity in 
broilers. The above results are not completely consistent, 
which may be due to the differences in the broiler breeds, 
the types and amounts of probiotics used, the diet compo-
sitions, and the feeding management levels.
Compatibility of Clostridium butyricum and Bacillus 
subtilis on lipid synthesis-related enzyme activity of 
broilers
In the process of fatty acid synthesis, acetyl-CoA in the mi-
tochondria is firstly transported to the cytosol by citric acid-
pyruvate cycle, and then the acetyl-CoA is used as the raw 
material to synthesize malonyl-CoA, and the carbon chain is 
extended through the cycle reaction to obtain the synthe-
sized fatty acid [25]. In this process, ACC, FAS, and NADP-
ME all play an important role [26,27]. Since the liver is the 
main site for fatty acid synthesis in broilers [28], this experi-
ment was carried out to measure the activities of lipid synthesis-
related enzymes (including ACC, FAS, and NADP-ME) in 
the liver of broilers. It was found that the NADP-ME activity 
in the liver of broiler chickens was significantly increased 
after the addition of C. butyricum and B. subtilis, indicating 
that the addition of C. butyricum and B. subtilis can promote 
the production of reducednicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide 
phosphate in the liver of broilers, thus providing more energy 
for the de novo synthesis of fatty acids [28]. The reason for 
the increase in NADP-ME activity in the liver of broilers in 
www.animbiosci.org  1941
Zhao et al (2024) Anim Biosci 37:1933-1944
the probiotic group may be that the addition of probiotics 
reduced the circulating factor ANGPTL4 which is recognized 
as an important mediator connecting intestinal microorgan-
isms and host lipid metabolism [4]. However, this needs 
further verification.
 At present, there are few studies on the effects of compati-
bility of C. butyricum and B. subtilis on the activities of enzymes 
related to lipid synthesis in the liver of broilers. However, it 
was found that 1×10
9
 CFU/kg of C. butyricum had no sig-
nificant effect on the activities of FAS and ME in the liver of 
21-day-old broilers [3] and on the activity of FAS enzymes 
in the liver of 42-day-old broilers [29]. Dietary supplementa-
tion of C. butyricum at a dose of 2.5×10
9
 CFU/kg significantly 
increased the expression of FAS mRNA in the liver of aged 
laying hens, but had no significant effect on the expression 
of ACC mRNA in the liver [30]. Besides, 4×10
11
 CFU/kg of 
B. subtilis significantly decreased the expression of FAS and 
ACCα mRNA in the liver of swine [31]. The above results 
are not completely consistent with the results of this experi-
ment, which may be due to the differences in the types and 
levels of probiotics added, the types and ages of animals 
raised, diet composition, and feeding management levels.
Compatibility of Clostridium butyricum and Bacillus 
subtilis on antioxidant status of broilers
Low levels of reactive oxygen species in cells are essential for 
normal metabolism, but their overproduction may induce 
oxidative stress in cells, leading to damage to DNA, proteins 
and lipids, with deleterious consequences for animal growth 
performance and product quality [32,33]. Therefore, the anti-
oxidant capacity is closely related to the health of animals. 
Total antioxidant capacity and GSH-Px activity can reflect 
the antioxidant capacity, while MDA content can reflect the 
level of lipid peroxidation [34,35]. The unchanged T-AOC, 
GSH-Px activity, and MDA content in the serum and liver 
of birds in the probiotic group in this study indicated that 
simultaneous addition of C. butyricum and B. subtilis did 
not negatively affect the antioxidant status of 21-day-old 
broiler chickens. At present, results of studies on the effects 
of C. butyricum and B. subtilis on the antioxidant status of 
broilers are not consistent. Liao et al [9] reported that diet 
supplementation of 2.5×10
8
 CFU/kg of C. butyricum did not 
affect GSH-Px activity in the serum and liver and MDA 
content in the serum of 42-day-old male AA broilers, but 
significantly reduced MDA content in the liver. Yu et al [18] 
showed that dietary supplementation of 1×10
9
 CFU/kg of C. 
butyricum significantly enhanced GSH-Px activity (serum 
and liver) and decreased MDA content (serum and liver) of 
21-day-old Cobb broilers, but had no effect on T-AOC (serum 
and liver). Bai et al [36] found that dietary supplementation 
of 2×10
10
 CFU/kg of B. subtilis fmbJ significantly enhanced 
the GSH-Px activity in the liver and significantly reduced 
the MDA content in the serum and liver of 42-day-old male 
AA broilers, but had no effect on the GSH-Px activity in the 
serum. Wang et al [20] showed that 1×10
9
 CFU/kg of B. subtilis 
DSM29784 significantly increased the serum GSH-Px activity 
of 63-day-old Lingnan yellow broilers, but the T-AOC and 
MDA content (serum) was not affected. Xu et al [21] found 
that dietary supplementation of 1.5×10
9
 CFU/kg of B. subtilis 
significantly increased GSH-Px activity (serum) and de -
creased MDA content (serum) of 42-day-old male Cobb 500 
broiler chickens. Mohamed et al [19] showed that dietary 
supplementation of 5×10
8
 of B. subtilis ATCC19659 signifi-
cantly increased serum T-AOC and decreased serum MDA 
content of 42-day-old AA broilers. The reason for the incon-
sistency of the above results may be due to the differences in 
the types and amounts of probiotics used, the animal breed 
and age, the diet composition, and the feeding management 
levels in each experiment. The reason why C. butyricum and 
B. subtilis mentioned above improved the antioxidant capacity 
of broilers is probably related to the regulation of Nrf2 sig-
naling pathway which is closely related to antioxidant capacity 
[2,37].
Compatibility of Clostridium butyricum and Bacillus 
subtilis on cecal microflora of broilers
The large number of microorganisms present in the cecum 
of poultry is of great significance for promoting the diges-
tion and absorption of nutrients in poultry and maintaining 
the stability of the intestinal microecology of poultry [1]. In 
recent years, probiotics as a microbial regulator has attracted 
more and more attention with the prohibition of antibiotics. 
At present, research on the effects of C. butyricum and B. 
subtilis on cecal microflora of broilers are mostly focused on 
the role of single bacterium, but the information on the effects 
of compatibility is lacking. Yu et al [18] found that adding 
1×10
9
 CFU/kg of C. butyricum to diet significantly reduced 
the abundance of Alistipes in the cecum of 21-day-old Cobb 
broilers, but had no effect on the abundance of Bacteroides 
and Faccalibacterium and the Chao 1 index of microorgan-
isms in the cecum. Jacquier et al [38] reported that B. subtilis 
29784 at a supplemental level of 1×10
8
 CFU/kg did not affect 
the Shannon index of cecal microbiota in 42-day-old Cobb 
500 broilers, but significantly reduced the abundance of cecal 
Bacteroides. Ma et al [1] pointed out that Firmicutes and 
Bacteroidota accounted for more than 95% of the whole 
phyla in the cecum of 42-day-old broilers. Adding 1×10
9
 
CFU/kg of B. subtilis DSM32315 to diet had no significant 
effect on the alpha diversity (including Shannon, Simpson, 
Chao1, etc.) of cecal microbiota in 42-day-old AA broilers, 
but enhanced the abundance of Firmicutes and Clostridia, 
and reduced the abundance of Bacteroidota in the cecum of 
broilers. Similar results were also obtained by Mohamed et 
al [19] by feeding B. subtilis ATCC19659 to AA broilers.

Zhang et al [39] showed that dietary supplementation of 
1.5×10
10
 to 2.25×10
10
 CFU/kg of B. subtilis (LIFEGUFS-S200) 
did not affect the alpha diversity (including Shannon, Simp-
son, Chao1, etc.) of cecal microorganisms in 42-day-old AA 
broilers, but enhanced the abundance of Faecalibacterium 
and CHKCI001 in the cecum of broilers. The above results 
regarding the variation in cecal microbiota composition of 
broilers were similar to the results of this study, but the re-
sults regarding the Shannon and Simpson index of cecal 
microbiota were inconsistent with the results of this study. 
Shannon and Simpson index mainly reflects the diversity 
and evenness of species distribution in the cecal microbial 
community of broilers. In general, the larger the Shannon 
and Simpson index, the higher the community diversity and 
the more even the species distribution. The compatibility of 
C. butyricum and B. subtilis significantly decreased the Shannon 
and Simpson index of cecal microbiota in this experiment, 
indicating that compatibility of C. butyricum and B. subtilis 
reduced the microbial community diversity and species dis-
tribution uniformity in broilers, but the reasons need to be 
further explored.
 In addition, this study also found that the difference of 
cecal microflora at the phylum and genus level of 21-day-old 
broilers caused by the compatibility of C. butyricum and B. 
subtilis was correlated with the growth performance. The re-
sults of the positive correlation between the abundance of 
Firmicutes and the growth performance of broilers and the 
negative correlation between the abundance of Bacteroidota 
and the growth performance of broilers were consistent with 
the results of Ley et al [40] and Ley et al [41], and also con-
sistent with the results found in this study that the compatibility 
of C. butyricum and B. subtilis significantly enhanced the 
growth performance of broiler chickens. These results indi-
cated that compatibility of C. butyricum and B. subtilis could 
improve the growth performance of 21-day-old broilers by 
changing the microflora in the cecum. However, the correla-
tion between the cecal microbiota at genus level and the 
growth performance of 21-day-old broilers is not completely 
consistent with the research results of Gong et al [42], Hu et 
al [43] and Zhang et al [39], which needs to be further veri-
fied by in vivo and in vitro studies.
 The changes of host intestinal microecological environ-
ment caused by dietary intervention in broiler chickens might 
lead to changes in some specific functional pathways [44]. 
To infer the effect of C. butyricum and B. subtilis on the func-
tional pathway of cecal microflora in broilers, Tax4Fun analysis 
was carried out in this study. The results showed that simul-
taneous supplementation of C. butyricum and B. subtilis had 
significant effects on 33 different functional pathways such 
as lipid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, and energy 
metabolism in broilers. This is inconsistent with the results 
of Ma et al [1] and Zhang et al [39] who found that B. subtilis 
had little effect on the predicted functions of cecal microbiota 
in broilers. The reasons for the inconsistent results may be 
due to the differences in animal breeds and ages, diet com-
position, management levels, types and amounts of probiotics 
used, and the methods for functional pathways prediction of 
cecal flora. Of course, the current analysis of functional path-
ways differences in this study is predictive, and further studies 
are needed to confirm the specific functional pathways of 
different microbes.
CONCLUSION
Simultaneous supplementation of C. butyricum and B. subtilis 
could modify the diversity and composition of cecal bacteria 
in broilers during the starter phase, causing changes in 33 
different functional pathways such as lipid metabolism, car-
bohydrate metabolism, and energy metabolism, thereby 
promoting the growth performance and the lipid synthesis-
related enzyme activity in the liver of broilers. However, these 
need to be further verified. In addition, simultaneous addi-
tion of C. butyricum and B. subtilis did not affect the serum 
lipids and antioxidant status of broilers during the starter 
phase.
