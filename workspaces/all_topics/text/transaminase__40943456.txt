Abstract
Understanding the structure–function relationships of pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent
transaminases is key to advancing pyridoxal-phosphate-dependent catalysis and engineering
transaminases for industrial applications. Despite our extensive knowledge of PLP-dependent
enzymatic reactions, engineering transaminase activity and stability remains challenging. Here,
we present the functional characterization of a novel PLP-dependent fold type IV transam-
inase from Desulfomonile tiedjei, alongside a detailed analysis of PLP binding and holoen-
zyme stability . This new transaminase exhibits activity toward various D-amino acids and
(R)-phenylethylamine.Structural modeling and site-directed mutagenesis of residues in the
second shell of the PLP-binding site revealed their roles in cofactor binding and the transami-
nase’s catalytic efficiency . Notably , the T199Q variant demonstrated a fivefold increase in PLP
affinity and improved activity under alkaline conditions. This is attributed to a newly formed
hydrogen bond that stabilizes the N1-binding region of PLP . Glutamine at position 199 is not
observed in homologous transaminases, making this non-natural substitution a novel and
beneficial modification. These findings emphasize the importance of second-shell interactions
in stabilizing PLP and expand our understanding of the structural diversity within PLP fold
type IV transaminases. This paves the way for the engineering of more stable and versatile
biocatalysts for industrial applications.

1. Introduction
Pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP)-dependent transaminases (TAs) represent a large, di-
verse superfamily of enzymes that catalyze the reversible stereoselective transfer of amino
groups from amino acids or amines to keto acids, ketones, and aldehydes [ 1–3]. Due to
their high selectivity, TAs have attracted considerable interest in industrial asymmetric
amination processes [ 4–7]. The D-amino acid superfamily of TAs (or TAs of PLP fold
type IV according to the classification of PLP-dependent enzymes [8]) includes subfami-
lies of L-stereoselective branched-chain amino acid transaminases (BCATs), D-amino acid
transaminases (DATAs), and (R)-amine–pyruvate transaminases ((R)-ATAs) [9,10]. The
functional unit of any TA is a dimer; two active sites are formed by the residues of both
subunits, with a cofactor covalently bound to the catalytic lysine residue in the re-position

in the active site [3,10]. The domain and active site architecture of TA dimers, including
the cofactor coordination, are highly conserved [9,10]. However, the active site functional
residues involved in substrate coordination vary between subfamilies, resulting in different
substrate specificity of TAs [9,11,12]. Earlier, the characteristic or specificity-determining
motifs were revealed for the subfamilies of PLP fold type IV TAs [9,13] (Table 1).

The characteristic motifs, as originally described by Höhne et al. [13], comprise first-
and second-shell residues. Here, we consider residues that interact directly with the
substrate and/or PLP to be first-shell residues and residues that interact with first-shell
residues and thus influence catalysis to be second-shell residues [ 14,15]. While the role
of first-shell residues is unambiguously defined by structural analysis and mutagenesis
studies [16–24], the effects of second-shell residues in stabilizing cofactors and modulating
enzyme activity are more intriguing and challenging to explain. Noteworthily, the evolved
biocatalysts (modified ATA-117) for sitagliptin synthesis contain 27 substitutions that are
mostly outside the active site [4].
Several studies have emphasized the functional importance of second-shell residues
in TAs. In BCATs, for example, the effective binding of the α-carboxylate group within
the active site is facilitated by second-shell arginine residues, which polarize the hydroxyl
group of a tyrosine residue and the main-chain NH groups that interact directly with the
substrate [22]. In the ω-transaminase from C. violaceum, engineering efforts targeting the
second coordination shell yielded a threefold increase in PLP affinity by introducing a
hydrogen bond with an aspartate residue that stabilizes the N1 atom of the cofactor [25].
In porcine aspartate aminotransferase, a hydrogen bond network involving second-shell
residues (namely, threonine and two histidine residues) has been shown to stabilize the
interaction between the N1 atom of PLP and the conserved aspartate residue. This main-
tains the protonation of the N1 atom, which is essential for catalysis [26]. Structural studies
of the DATA from H. hydrossis (Halhy) reveal the hydrogen bond network surrounding
the N1 atom, including not only the conserved first-shell glutamate residue but also the
second-shell arginine and asparagine residues [27]. Furthermore, mutagenesis and kinetic
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 8536 3 of 18
analysis of the variants demonstrate that the conserved second-shell arginine residue (R90
in Halhy) plays a role in maintaining the correct cofactor state [28]. Studies on (R)-ATAs
have shown that replacing the second-shell glutamate residue with a glutamine residue
alters the pH optimum of the transaminase reaction and influences the pKa of the first-shell
histidine residue, which is thought to be involved in substrate deprotonation [29]. The pH
dependence of the kinetic parameters of aspartate aminotransferase from E. coli appears to
be determined by the protonation state of residues that interact with the cofactor, as well as
that of some outlying residues [30].
DATAs catalyze the transfer of an amino group from a D-amino acid to a keto acid,
forming a new D-amino acid and a new keto acid in the process [9]. The overall transamina-
tion reaction is a combination of two half-reactions. Firstly, the deamination of a D-amino
acid results in the formation and release of a keto acid, accompanied by the amino group
transfer to the cofactor. In the second half-reaction, the new keto acid enters the active site,
releasing the new D-amino acid and restoring the initial PLP form of TAs [3,31]. DATAs are
mainly active toward some D-amino acids and keto acids, with transamination between
D-alanine and α-ketoglutarate being the most effective [32–38]. The active site of PLP fold
type IV TAs is a combination of two pockets: the O-pocket, located near the O3 ′ atom
of PLP , and the P-pocket, located near the phosphate group of PLP [ 9]. Two groups of
DATAs have been discovered so far (Table 1). Group I DATAs, which include the canonical
DATA from Bacillus sp. YM-1 (bsDATA), are characterized by a conserved Y-R-H triad
in the active site (“carboxylate trap”), which ensures the binding of the α-carboxylate
group in the O-pocket and therefore selectivity toward D-amino acids [ 39,40]. Group II
(non-canonical) DATAs lack the “carboxylate trap” but instead contain a conserved R-[RK]
dyad in the active site comprising a first-shell arginine residue and a second-shell arginine
or lysine residue [32–36] (Table 1). Some group II DATAs exhibit activity toward primary
(R)-amines [32,33]. The first-shell conserved arginine residue binds theα-carboxylate group
in the O-pocket [35,41]. It also modulates PLP binding via a network of noncovalent inter-
actions [28], and the second-shell conserved arginine residue ensures the first-shell arginine
residue is positioned correctly for catalysis [28,41]. It has also been shown that the flexibility
of the arginine residues favors the binding of the hydrophobic moiety of ( R)-amines in
the O-pocket of the WT DATA from B. saxobsidence (BlasaTA) and Halhy variant, thus
providing the activity toward (R)-amines [28,32]. Furthermore, the second-shell arginine
residues (R90 or R88 in Halhy and the DATA fromA. colombiense (AmicoTA), respectively)
contribute to the stabilization of the functional dimer [28,41].
In this study, we provide a detailed characterization of a novel non-canonical DATA
from the Gram-negative bacterium Desulfomonile tiedjei (DestiTA) [42]. This enzyme has
a unique R-D dyad in the active site, a combination of a first-shell conserved arginine
residue and a second-shell aspartate residue (Table 1), while retaining activity toward
D-amino acids and primary ( R)-amines. We also observed changes in the second-shell
residues of the PLP binding site. We investigated the effects of second-shell residues on
PLP binding and the catalytic efficiency of DestiTA through a combination of biochemical,
structural, and mutagenesis analyses. Our findings deepen our understanding of the subtle
structure–function relationship in PLP-dependent TAs and suggest effective substitutions
to improve their stability.
2. Results
2.1. Enzyme Identification, Expression, and Purification
Searching for non-canonical DATAs revealed a TA from the Gram-negative bacterium
D. tiedjei—DestiTA Uniprot ID I4C827_DESTA (Table 1). DestiTA shared 25.4% sequence
identity with the BCAT from E. coli; 24.0% with the ( R)-ATA from A. fumigatus; 27.4%
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 8536 4 of 18
with the bsDATAfrom Bacillus sp., and 23–32% with group II DATAs. DestiTA was cloned
and expressed in a soluble form in E. coli and purified to homogeneity (Figure S1). The
molecular weight of purified DestiTA was approximately 68 kDa, as determined by gel
filtration, indicating DestiTA as a homodimer (Figure S2).
2.2. Substrate Specificity, Enantioselectivity, and Stability
In the overall transamination reactions, DestiTA was active toward some D-amino acids
and α-keto acids (Table S1). No activity toward L-amino acids was detected. DestiTA was also
active toward (R)-(+)-1-phenylethylamine ((R)-PEA) but not toward (S)-PEA. The specificity
constant for (R)-PEA, however, was 150 times lower than that for D-alanine (Table 2). The
activity toward ketones was not observed (characteristic feature of (R)-ATA [11,13]). The
enantioselectivity of DestiTA was evaluated in the amination of 3-methyl-2-oxobutyrate with
D-glutamate as an amino donor. The product yield of D-valine after 24 h of the reaction at
40 ◦C achieved 99%. The enantiomeric excess of D-valine exceeded 99% (Table S2). Thus,
DestiTA was ascribed to group II DATAs based on the sequence analysis (Table 1) and
substrate scope.

1—Half-transition temperature (T 0.5) of the thermal unfolding was measured in 50 mM K-phosphate buffer,
pH 8.0, for 2 µM apoenzyme of the variants of DestiTA. The values in the brackets correspond to T 0.5 of the
variants in the presence of 500 µM PLP .
pH dependences of DestiTA-specific activities are typical of TAs: the pH range
of 7.5–8.0 is optimal for the reaction D-alanine + α-ketoglutarate (Figure 1), and the pH
range 8.0–9.0 is the best for the reaction (R)-PEA + α-ketoglutarate (Figure S3). Further
kinetic analysis with D-alanine and (R)-PEA was performed in 50 mM K-phosphate buffer,
pH 8.0, at 50 ◦C, and in 50 mM Na-pyrophosphate buffer, pH 9.0, at 50 ◦C, respectively.
The stability of DestiTA was examined by determining its half-transition temperature
(T0.5), representing the midpoint between its native and denatured states during thermal
unfolding of the apoenzyme and holoenzyme (Table 2).

The stability of the holoenzyme was evaluated by analyzing spectra and determin-
ing the equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd(PLP)) of the holoenzyme as an indicator of
DestiTA’s affinity to the cofactor. DestiTA’s absorption spectrum exhibited two distinctive
peaks: a dominant peak at 280 nm and a prominent peak at 410 nm, accompanied by a
shoulder at 330 nm (Figure 2). The 410 nm band corresponded to the ketoenamine tau-
tomer of the protonated internal aldimine, while the shoulder at 330 nm corresponded
to the enolimine tautomer [ 43]. Monitoring changes to the absorption spectrum of the
DestiTA holoenzyme upon incubation in a 50 mM K-phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, at 50◦C for
five minutes revealed a shift in the 410 nm peak to 399 nm, indicating PLP leakage and
suggesting instability of the holoenzyme under these conditions. The affinity of DestiTA
to PLP was further quantified by a thermal shift assay, which yielded a K d(PLP) value of
11 ± 1 µM. This is approximately fivefold higher than the reported value for the homolo-
gous Halhy [28], suggesting weaker PLP binding. A structural analysis of the PLP binding
site and the active site architecture of the DestiTA dimer was carried out to evaluate the
holoenzyme’s stability.

2.3. Overall Structure of DestiTA. PLP Coordination in the Active Site
Unfortunately, all attempts to crystallize WT DestiTA and its variants were unsuccess-
ful. NMR spectroscopy, a powerful technique for determining protein structures in solution,
will be considered in future work. A DestiTA model was created for structural analysis.
Based on gel filtration data, DestiTA was modeled as a homodimer. The DestiTA sub-
unit model included all structural elements characteristic of PLP fold type IV TAs observed
in crystal structures (Figure 3A). A structural comparison of the DestiTA model and the
AmicoTA–D-glutamate complex (PDB ID: 8AYK) revealed key residues involved in sub-
strate binding. The α-carboxylate group of the substrate was likely coordinated by residues
R37* and T197 in the O-pocket. Meanwhile, the γ-carboxylate group of either D-glutamate
or α-ketoglutarate appeared to interact with residue R262 in the P-pocket (see Figure S4).

from the adjacent subunit. The distances are given in Å.
A distinctive feature of DestiTA, compared to other group II DATAs, was the presence
of a negatively charged D103 residue in the O-pocket of the active site (see Table 1 and
Figure 3B). Detailed inspection revealed a single plausible interaction involving D103: the
formation of a salt bridge with R129, which is located on the βZ-strand (Figure 3B). This
interaction positioned D103 away from the active site, with its side chain located ~7 Å
from the first-shell residue R37*, which was too distant for interaction—a prerequisite for a
second-shell residue. In the homologous Halhy and AmicoTA, the distances between the
conserved second-shell and first-shell arginine residues (the latter of which is crucial for
coordinating the substrate’sα-carboxylic group) were 3.6 and 3.7 Å, respectively (Figure 3B).
Consequently, R37* appeared to be less constrained by neighboring residues than in Halhy
and AmicoTA.
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 8536 7 of 18
We analyzed the PLP-binding site in DestiTA. The PLP molecule was covalently bound
to the K158 residue and coordinated by residues that are highly conserved and typical of
PLP fold type IV TAs. E194 and Y162 interacted with the N1 atom and the O3 ′ atom of
PLP , respectively. Meanwhile, R61, T223, and T260 coordinated the phosphate group (see
Figure 3C). However, DestiTA differed from the known PLP fold type IV TAs in the second
coordination shell of the PLP binding site (see Figure 4).
Figure 4. Structure-based sequence alignment of DestiTA and TAs of PLP fold type IV with known
structures, referred to by PDB codes.
The first notable difference was the replacement of a conserved acidic residue (glu-
tamate or aspartate) on the βX-strand with a threonine residue (T43). In the listed TA
structures (except the (R)-ATA fromArthrobacter sp. KNK168, PDB ID: 3WWH), a hydrogen-
bonded salt bridge was observed between the side chains of the glutamate/aspartate
residue and the arginine residue that interacted with the phosphate group of PLP (Figure
S5). The glutamate residue (at position T43 in DestiTA) appeared to be important for PLP
binding, as was demonstrated earlier for bsDATA [44].
Another hot spot was observed near the glutamate residue coordinating the N1 atom
of PLP . In Halhy, a hydrogen-bonding network involving E176, R137, and N181 contributed
to the stabilization of the protonated N1 atom (Figure S5) [ 27]. In contrast, in DestiTA,
while the conserved R152 was retained, the position homologous to N181 was occupied by
a threonine residue (T199) (Figure 3C). Generally, only threonine or asparagine residues
were found in this position in homologous TAs (Figure 4 and Table S3). In structures
containing a threonine residue, the distance between its side chain and the γ-carboxylic
group of the glutamate residue coordinating the N1 atom of PLP (E/OE1–T/OG1 bond)
was greater than 4.5 Å. This is too large for a hydrogen bond to form (Table S3). In contrast,
in structures with an asparagine residue, the corresponding distance (E/OE1–N/ND2
bond) decreased to 3.1–3.4 Å, enabling the formation of a weak hydrogen bond. Based on
this analysis, we selected the T199N and T199Q substitutions for experimental study. T199Q
was a non-natural substitution: the longer side chain of the glutamine residue compared
to the asparagine residue may favor a stronger hydrogen bond with the N1-coordinating
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 8536 8 of 18
glutamate residue, thus potentially enhancing the cofactor binding. Further structural
modeling of the T199N and T199Q variants revealed a progressive shortening of the
distance between the side chains of E194 and residue 199 from 5.0 Å in the WT to 2.8
Å in the T199Q variant, suggesting the strengthening of the stabilizing hydrogen bond
network (Figure 3D).
A previous study of Halhy demonstrated the input of the second-shell arginine (R90,
see Table 1) in stabilizing the PLP molecule [28]. However, substituting D103 for arginine
would result in electrostatic repulsion with R129, disrupting the active site. Therefore, we
ruled out the D103R substitution.
Overall, we chose the T43E, T199N, and T199Q substitutions to improve PLP binding.
These variants were expressed in a soluble form in E. coli and purified to homogeneity
(Figure S1). Gel filtration confirmed the homodimer organization of the variants (Figure
S2). Prior to examining the effects of the substitutions on PLP binding, we performed a
general characterization of the variants.
2.4. Characterization of the DestiTA Variants: Thermal Stability and Catalytic Function
The T43E substitution had a dramatic impact on catalytic activity. The variant showed
no activity in the reaction D-alanine + α-ketoglutarate at pH 8.0 and retained only 2% of WT
activity at pH 6.5 (Figure 1A, Table 2); the activity toward (R)-PEA was lost. Additionally,
the temperature optimum shifted to 40 ◦C (Figure 1B). The T199N substitution caused
no changes in the catalytic properties of DestiTA in the reaction between D-alanine and
α-ketoglutarate (Table 2, Figure 1). Meanwhile, the T199Q substitution caused a ~100-fold
decrease in the specificity constant (kcat/Km) for D-alanine but did not affect the catalytic
constant (kcat), indicating a decrease in substrate binding affinity of DestiTA (Table 2).
The catalytic efficiency toward α-ketoglutarate decreased only slightly, possibly due to its
multipoint binding in the active site. The T199N and T199Q variants were both inactive
toward (R)-PEA.
Interestingly, the T199Q substitution significantly improved the pH stability of DestiTA.
The T199Q variant’s pH activity profile was broader than those of WT and T199N for the
D-alanine + α-ketoglutarate reaction (Figure 1A). The T199Q variant retained 70–90% of
its activity at alkaline pH values for both sub-saturating (25 mM) and near-saturating
(100 mM) concentrations of D-alanine (Figure 1A).
We assessed the thermal stability of the DestiTA variants using the half-transition
temperature (T0.5) (Table 2). Similar to WT DestiTA, the thermal stability of the T199N and
T199Q variants depended on the presence of PLP in the assay buffer. Adding a saturating
amount of PLP to the apoenzyme increased T0.5 by over 8 ◦C. The T199Q substitution im-
proved the stability of the holoenzyme; however, the stability of the apoenzyme decreased.
The T43E substitution increased the T0.5 of the apoenzyme by 5 ◦C, likely due to the forma-
tion of a stabilizing salt bridge between the side chains of E43 and R61 (Figure S6). Notably,
the thermal stability of the T43E variant remained unaffected by the addition of PLP .
In summary, introducing a negatively charged residue at position 43 led to the loss of
the catalytic function of DestiTA, while substitution at the 199 position to glutamine, but
not to asparagine, affected substrate binding affinity and pH stability.
2.5. Characterization of the DestiTA Variants: Cofactor Binding and Internal Aldimine Formation
To examine the effects of the substitutions of the PLP binding, we investigated the
cofactor binding by the thermal shift assay and the internal aldimine state by CD and
UV-Vis spectroscopy.
The holoenzymes (PLP forms) of the T199N and T199Q variants exhibited spectral
features similar to the WT variant (Figure 5A). Since the pH dependence of the DestiTA
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 8536 9 of 18
activity changed with the T199Q substitution, we checked if this substitution affected the
protonation state of the Schiff base under alkaline conditions. The pH titration experiment
revealed that both the WT and T199Q variants had a protonated internal aldimine in
solution at pH 8–10. This was evident by the absence of an absorption maximum at
360–380 nm, which is typically associated with the deprotonated aldimine form (Figure
S7) [23,44]. The absorbance spectrum of the T43E variant, incubated with an excess of PLP ,
indicated the unbounded state of PLP (Figure 5A).
Figure 5. Spectral analysis of the internal aldimine of the WT Desti (red), T43E (black), T199N (blue),
and T199Q (green) variants in 50 mM K-phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, at 25◦C. (A) Absorbance spectra of
15 µM holoenzymes of the variants. (B) CD spectra of 15 µM apoenzymes of the DestiTA variants in
the presence of 30 µM PLP (1 mM in the case of the T43E variant). Gray lines represent spectra of free
PLP (15 µM in A; 30 µM in B).
The thermal shift assays revealed Kd(PLP) values of 33 ± 2 µM for the T199N variant
and 2.2 ± 0.4 µM for the T199Q variant at pH 8.0 in 50 mM K-phosphate buffer, indicating
a fivefold increase in PLP affinity for T199Q relative to WT. This enhanced affinity was
maintained at higher pH values: at pH 10.0, the Kd(PLP) values were 21 ± 4 µM for WT and
1.4 ± 0.3 µM for T199Q; at pH 11.0, the values were 20 ± 4 µM for WT and 1.2 ± 0.2 µM
for T199Q. The thermal shift upon adding PLP to the T43E solution was not observed.
We utilized circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy to detect the internal aldimines in an
excess of free PLP , which lacks the CD signal [45,46]. The WT, T199N, and T199Q variants
exhibited a similar strong negative dichroic signal at 420 nm, which is indicative of internal
aldimine formation (Figure 5B). However, no CD signal was detected for the T43E variant,
even with 1 mM excess PLP , suggesting an impaired ability to form a functional internal
aldimine (Figure 5B). Notably, adding increasing concentrations of PLP (up to 600µM) to
the reaction mixture did not enhance the catalytic activity of the T43E variant (Table S4),
thus showing that its reduced activity was not due to cofactor insufficiency. Together with
the absence of the thermal shift, these observations show the inability of the T43E variant
to form active holoenzymes (PLP form).
3. Discussion
Group II DATAs are primarily distinguished by the conserved dyad within the charac-
teristic motifs of the active site: a critical arginine residue (first-shell) that binds the sub-
strate’s α-carboxylate group, paired with a second-shell positive residue (R or K) (Table 1).
Interestingly, DestiTA retains only the conserved arginine residue (R37) in the first shell,
while the second position is occupied by a negatively charged aspartate residue (D103).
This combination is typical of a subfamily of ( R)-ATAs [11]; however, DestiTA does not
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 8536 10 of 18
catalyze the amination of ketones or the deamination of (R)-primary amines but rather the
deamination of (R)-PEA. The latter is an unspecific substrate for some BCATs [47,48] and
some group II DATAs [28,32]. Thus, DestiTA exhibits the structure–function relationship
characteristic of group II DATAs, showing activity toward D-amino acids, α-keto acids,
and (R)-PEA. In terms of catalytic efficiency, DestiTA is second only to Halhy. This find-
ing indicates the structural variability within group II DATAs, and we hypothesize that
substituting the second-shell arginine residue with an aspartate residue (D103) enhances
the conformational flexibility of the first-shell arginine residue (R37), thus facilitating the
binding of the hydrophobic moiety of (R)-PEA within the O-pocket and supporting the
well-known promiscuity of TAs [49]. This is consistent with previous findings: in BlasaTA,
which is active toward some primary aromatic (R)-amines, the flexibility of the conserved
first-shell arginine residue appears to be intrinsic; in Halhy, substitution of the second-shell
arginine residue induces side-chain flexibility in the first-shell arginine residue, thus fa-
voring (R)-PEA activity [28,32]. At the same time, D103 may also decrease holoenzyme
stability, as evidenced by the higher value of the PLP dissociation constant value of WT
DestiTA compared to Halhy [28].
PLP binding is conserved in TAs of PLP fold type IV . The cofactor is covalently
bound within the active site via a Schiff base linkage to a catalytic lysine residue, forming
an internal aldimine. Four functional groups of PLP—the phenolic oxygen (O3 ′ atom),
phosphate group, pyridine nitrogen (N1 atom), and Schiff base—are essential for the proper
binding of PLP in the active site. Their protonation states are controlled by the local
environment, especially through specific hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions
provided by surrounding amino acid residues [ 31,50]. Thus, the protonation of the N1
atom, which is critical in enhancing the electron sink capability of PLP , thereby facilitating
transamination, is stabilized by a hydrogen bond with a conserved aspartate or glutamate
residue and second-shell residues [23,24]. The phenolic oxygen (O3′ atom) typically forms
one or two hydrogen bonds with neighboring proton-donating side chains, contributing
to proper positioning of the cofactor and its ionization state [ 18,21,22]. Disruption of
these interactions has been shown to impair catalytic function, likely due to destabilizing
PLP’s electronic properties and altering the ionization state of the Schiff base [ 17–20].
The phosphate group in the active site of TAs is coordinated by an arginine residue and
several polar residues; the lack of one of these bonds leads to the impairment of PLP
binding [16]. Although the primary coordination of PLP—via interactions with K158 (Schiff
base), E194 (N1), Y162 (O3’), and R61/T223/T260 (phosphate group)—is conserved in
DestiTA, structural comparisons with homologous enzymes revealed some differences in
the second-shell environment that seem to contribute to the observed weaker PLP binding.
Two positions—T43 and T199—were selected for mutation analysis to improve PLP
binding. Position 43 is located near the phosphate group of PLP . Despite the presence
of a glutamate residue at this position in homologous enzymes, the T43E substitution in
DestiTA drastically reduced the enzyme activity and impaired internal aldimine formation.
Introducing a negatively charged glutamate in this area, particularly near the catalytic
lysine (see Figure 3C), appears to disturb the finely tuned electrostatic environment required
for proper PLP anchoring in DestiTA. Furthermore, the formation of a salt bridge between
the catalytic lysine cannot be ruled out. It leads to the instability of the holoenzyme and
the removal of the catalytic lysine from the active site. This unfavorable salt bridge may be
partly neutralized at an acidic pH due to the protonation of the E43 side chain, which shifts
the pH optimum to the acidic region. The instability of the T43E holoform may also lead
to a decrease in the optimum temperature of the transamination reaction. These findings
contrast with mutation experiments involving bsDATA, whereas the opposite substitutions
at the homologous position (E32Q and E32A) led to a loss of activity [44]. Together, these
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 8536 11 of 18
results highlight the symbiotic (compensating) effects of hydrogen bonds coordinating PLP
in TAs, particularly when second-shell residues contribute to shaping the electronic and
structural environment of the cofactor.
Interesting findings emerged from the analysis of position 199, located near the N1
atom of PLP . While both T199N and T199Q substitutions preserve the structural features
necessary for catalytic function, only the T199Q variant enhances cofactor affinity. Thre-
onine and asparagine residues are equivalent in this position. Importantly, a glutamine
residue at position 199 is not observed in any known homologous PLP fold type IV TAs.
Introducing a glutamine at position 199 represents a non-natural but beneficial substitution.
Moreover, the T199Q substitution favors DestiTA activity in the alkaline region. Generally,
shifting the pH optima of TAs remains a significant challenge in enzyme engineering,
with only a few successful examples reported thus far [29,41,51]. Spectral analysis of the
T199Q variant revealed the protonated state of the internal aldimine at alkaline pH values.
Furthermore, the T199Q variant exhibits tight PLP binding across the pH range of 8 to 11.
It appears that the T199Q substitution increases the stability of the protonated state of the
N1 atom of PLP , thus favoring the formation of the transamination reaction intermediates,
particularly the quinonoid intermediate, at neutral and alkaline pH values. The stability
of the quinonoid intermediate favors the enzyme activity in alkaline media, where the
concentration of protons decreases. This substitution stabilizes the holoenzyme, resulting
in a higher T0.5.
Engineering strategies for PLP-dependent enzymes generally focus on stabilizing
the active enzyme in water–organic solvent media with high substrate concentrations at
temperatures between 40 and 60 ◦C [9,52]. For instance, sitagliptin production was most
efficient at 50% dimethyl sulfoxide, pH 8.5, 1 M isopropanol, and 0.5–1 g/L PLP at 40◦C [4].
Improving PLP binding in the holoenzyme is not of prime importance when developing
PLP-dependent biocatalysts. Typically, PLP leakage from the holoenzyme is solved by
adding PLP in excess to the reaction medium. More important is the thermal stability of
the biocatalyst, including its operational stability. It is also clear that stabilizing PLP in
the active holoenzyme improves its operational stability in limited PLP conditions and
its thermal stability as well [25,53]. The thermal and operational stabilities of DestiTA in
limited PLP conditions were affected by stabilizing the protonation state of the N1 atom of
PLP . This was achieved by substituting the threonine residue for the glutamine residue,
which is unusual for this position in TAs. This was demonstrated for TAs for the first time.
4. Materials and Methods
4.1. Preparation and Purification of the Recombinant DestiTA and Its Variants
The gene Desti_3054encoding a fold type IV transaminase was found in the complete
genome sequence ofDesulfomonile tiedjeiDSM 6799 [42]. The nucleotide sequence ofDesti_3054
was codon-optimized for expression in E. coli using server Optimizer
(http://genomes.urv .es/OPTIMIZER/ (accessed on 2 August 2024)) and synthesized by
ATG Service Gene (St. Petersburg, Russia) with overhangs complementing the NdeI
and HindIII restriction sites attached to the 5 ′- and 3 ′-ends, respectively . The synthetic
gene was cloned into the pET-21d vector (Novagen, Darmstadt, Germany), modified as
described in [ 28]. Recombinant DestiTA (302 a.a., 34.2 kDa) fused at the N-terminus
to a (His)6-TEV-tag was expressed in E. coli Rosetta(DE3) pLysS cells (Novagen). The
transformed cells were grown in LB medium, supplemented with 100 µg/mL ampi-
cillin and 20 µg/mL chloramphenicol (Panreac-AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany) and
0.04 mM PLP at 37 ◦C until the OD600 value reached 0.8, and the expression was in-
duced with 0.2 mM IPTG. After incubation for 18 h at 24 ◦C, the cells were harvested by
centrifugation, resuspended in50 mM Na-phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, supplemented with
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 8536 12 of 18
500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10%
(v/v) glycerol, 2 M urea, 0.2 mg/mL lysozyme, 100µM PLP , and1 mM PMSF, and disrupted
by sonication. The crude cell extract was centrifuged for 45 min at 18,500× g. The supernatant
was loaded into a HisTrap HP column (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA, USA), equilibrated in a
binding buffer (50 mM Na-phosphate, pH 8.0, supplemented with 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM
imidazole, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100). The (His)6-tagged recombinant
DestiTA was eluted with a linear gradient from 20 to 500 mM imidazole in the same buffer
without Triton X-100. The active fraction was incubated for 1 h with a twofold molar excess of
PLP at +4 ◦C and then concentrated using a 30 kDa cut-off centrifugal filter device (Millipore,
Burlington, MA, USA) and transferred into 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, supplemented with
50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 5 mMβ-mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, and TEV protease
(1 mg per 10 mg of the protein). The solution was incubated for 2 h at room temperature,
dialyzed against the binding buffer, and loaded into a HisTrap HP column. The flow-through
was concentrated and applied to a Superdex200 10/300GL column (Cytiva) equilibrated in
20 mM HEPES buffer, pH 8.0, supplemented with 100 mM NaCl and 100µM PLP . Active
fractions of DestiTA were collected and stored at +4◦C. The protein purity was detected by
SDS-PAGE (12%). The protein concentration was determined spectrophotometrically [54].
The T43E, T199N, and T199Q variants of DestiTA were created by easy single-primer
site-directed mutagenesis as described in [ 55]. The list of the mutagenesis and check
primers is given in Table S5. All variants were expressed in a soluble form in E. coli and
purified to homogeneity as described for the WT DestiTA. The amino acid sequences were
verified by MALDI-TOF MS analysis (UltraFlextreme Bruker Daltonik, Bremen, Germany).
The PLP forms of the DestiTA variants were obtained by incubating the enzymes with
a tenfold molar excess of PLP and 5 mM α-ketoglutarate for 2 h at 25 ◦C, followed by
transfer into the assay buffer, pH 8.0, using a HiTrap desalting column (GE Healthcare,
Chicago, IL, USA).
The DestiTA variant apoenzymes were obtained by incubating the PLP forms with
2 mM phenylhydrazine for 20 min at 25 ◦C, followed by transfer into the assay buffer,
pH 8.0, using a HiTrap desalting column.
4.2. Enzyme Activity Assay
The activity of the DestiTA variants in the transamination reaction with D-alanine or
D-glutamate as the amino donor was observed spectrophotometrically using the second
enzymatic reaction with lactate dehydrogenase from rabbit muscle (LDH) (Roche Diag-
nostic GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) or (R)-2-hydroxyglutarate dehydrogenase (HGDH)
from Acidaminococcus fermenats [36] using NADH as the coenzyme. The reaction progress
was monitored by the absorbance decay at 340 nm (εNADH = 6.22 mM−1cm−1) in microtiter
plates (UV-Star, Greiner, Germany) using a SPECTROstar Omega plate reader (software
version 5.50 R4, BMG Labtech, GmbH, Ortenberg, Germany). The activity of the DestiTA
variants in the transamination reaction with (R)-(+)-1-phenylethylamine ((R)-PEA) as the
amino donor was determined by monitoring acetophenone (AcPh) production at 245 nm
(εAcPh = 11.6 mM−1 cm−1), using an Evolution 300 UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Thermo
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). The activity of the variants was calculated from the initial
linear region of the reaction’s progress curve. One unit (U) was defined as the amount of
the enzyme that catalyzed the conversion of 1 µmol of substrate into a product per minute.
The reaction with D-alanine was conducted in 50 mM K-phosphate buffer, pH 8.0 or
6.5, supplemented with 0.5–200 mM D-alanine, 0.1–50 mM α-ketoglutarate, 30 µM PLP ,
2–200 µg/mL (0.05–5 µM) of the purified variant, 330 µM NADH, and 2 U/mL LDH
at 40–50 ◦C. The reaction with ( R)-PEA was observed in 50 mM pyrophosphate buffer,
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 8536 13 of 18
pH 9.0, supplemented with 1–100 mM (R)-PEA, 0.1–10 mM α-ketoglutarate, 30 µM PLP ,
and 0.036–0.1 mg/mL (1–2.5 µM) of the purified variant at 50 ◦C.
The kinetic parameters of the overall reactions were determined using the Michaelis–
Menten model. The substrate saturation curves were generated at constant co-substrate
concentrations to calculate the kinetic parameters (Table S6). The kinetic parameters were
calculated by fitting the initial velocity data to Equation (1):
V = Vmax × A × B
KAm × B + KBm × A + A × B (1)
where V is the initial velocity, Vmax is the maximal velocity, A and B are the substrate
concentrations, and KA
m and KB
m are the Km of substrates A and B, respectively. All mea-
surements were performed at least in triplicate. The data were analyzed using Origin 8.0
software (Origin Lab, Northampton, MA, USA, assessed on 14 May 2025).
4.3. Effect of pH and Temperature on the Transamination Reaction
pH and temperature effects were examined using overall transamination reactions
between 10 mM α-ketoglutarate and 25 (or 100 mM) D-alanine or 2 mM α-ketoglutarate
and 5 mM (R)-PEA. The optimal pH was determined at 40 ◦C in a mixed buffer of 25 mM
Na-acetate, 25 mM Na-pyrophosphate, and 25 mM Na-phosphate, pH 6.0–11.0. The effect
of temperature on the reaction rate was analyzed in 50 mM K-phosphate buffer, pH 8.0 or
6.5, or 50 mM Na-pyrophosphate, pH 9.0.
4.4. Spectral Analysis
Absorption spectra were collected in a 1 cm optical path length cuvette using an
Evolution 300 UV–Vis spectrophotometer. CD spectra were collected in a 1 cm optical path
length cuvette using a Chirascan instrument (Applied Photophysics, Surrey, UK).
4.5. Analysis of the Enantiomeric Excess in the Transamination Reaction
The enantioselectivity of DestiTA was evaluated in the amination reaction 3-methyl-2-
oxobutyrate + D-glutamate. To shift the equilibrium toward the products, a one-pot three-
enzyme system was employed. The coproduct, α-ketoglutarate, was removed from the
reaction mixture using HGDH, while NADH was recovered by glucose dehydrogenase
(GDH) (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) converting D-glucose. The reaction mixture contained
100 mM K-phosphate buffer, pH 7.5, 100 µM PLP , 50 mM D-glutamate, 50 mM 3-methyl-2-
oxobutyrate, 0.1 mg/mL DestiTA, 50 µM NAD+, 150 mM D-glucose, 180 U/mL HGDH,
and 30 U/mL GDH. After 24 h at 40 ◦C, the reaction was terminated by removing the
enzyme using a 30 kDa cut-off centrifugal filter device (Millipore). The deproteinized
aliquot was analyzed by HPLC (ÄKTA Purifier, Cytiva, Marlborough, MA, USA) using a
reverse-phase C18 column (Zorbax Eclipse XDB-C18, 5 µm, 4.6 mm × 150 mm (Agilent,
Santa Clara, CA, USA)). The chiral analysis of the D-valine was performed by HPLC
using a reverse-phase C18 column with a UV detector set at 340 nm after derivatization
with Marfey’s reagent (Sigma). The HPLC and derivatization conditions are shown in the
Supplementary Materials (Table S2).
4.6. ThermoFluor Assay
The thermal stability of the WT DestiTA and the variants was evaluated by the Ther-
moFluor assay. The assay was conducted in 50 mM K-phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, in the
presence of 25× ProteOrange Protein Gel Stain (Lumiprobe, Westminster, MD, USA). The
final concentration of the enzyme was 0.07 mg/mL (2 µM). Measurements were performed
using a CFX96 RT-PCR system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) at every 0.2 ◦C increment
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2025, 26, 8536 14 of 18
after equilibrating for 10 sec from 25 to 90 ◦C, with excitation and emission filters 515–530
and 560–580 nm, respectively. All thermal unfolding curves were measured in triplicate.
Raw data were collected with CFX Manage software (version 2.3, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,
USA. Assessed on 16 June 2025) and processed with Origin 8.0 software (assessed on 14
May 2025). The midpoint temperature of thermal denaturation (T0.5) was determined from
the peak of the first derivative of the thermal unfolding curves.
4.7. Determination of the Equilibrium Dissociation Constant of the Holoenzyme
The dissociation constant (Kd(PLP)) of the holoenzyme was assessed by the thermal
shift assay (Figure S8). For that, the apoenzyme (2 µM) was incubated at 25 ◦C in the
presence of different PLP concentrations of 0.5–500µM for 1 h in either 50 mM K-phosphate
buffer (pH 8.0) or 50 mM Na-pyrophosphate buffer (pH 10.0 or 11.0). The samples were
then analyzed by the ThermoFluor assay using the same buffer conditions. The dissociation
constant was determined by fitting the data to Equation (2):
∆T0.5 = ∆T0.5max ×
[E] + [PLP] + Kd(PLP) −
r
[E] + [PLP] + Kd(PLP)
2
− 4[E][PLP]
2[E] (2)
where [E] and [PLP] represent the total concentrations of the apo form and PLP , respectively,
∆T0.5 is an observed shift in the midpoint temperature of thermal denaturation at the PLP
concentration [PLP], and ∆T0.5max is the maximum shift when all enzyme molecules are
complexed with PLP . All measurements were performed at least in triplicate, and the data
were analyzed using Origin 8.0 software (assessed on 14 May 2025).
4.8. Molecular Modeling and Structure Analysis
The in silico models of the WT, T43E, T199N, and T199Q DestiTA variants were
obtained using the AlphaFold3 structure prediction server [ 56], followed by the energy
minimization of the TA-cofactor complexes. The AlphaFold3-predicted structures consisted
of two subunits without a cofactor. Coordinates for PLP molecules were added to these
models based on an analysis of known crystal structures of the PLP-form DATA. The
holoenzyme’s models were relaxed with NAMD Molecular Dynamics Software, Version
2.14 (Theoretical and Computational Biophysics Group, Beckman Institute, University
of Illinois, Urbana, IL, USA, accessed on 22 June 2025) [ 57]. A protein macromolecule
description was created using the topology and parameters for the CHARMM36 force
field [58]. The protonation states of the amino acid residues were as follows: positively
charged R and K; negatively charged E and D; and neutral H. The topology of the PLP
molecule was obtained using the CHARMM General Force Field (CGenFF), Version 3.0,
https://www.charmm-gui.org/, accessed on 12 January 2025 (Im Lab, Lehigh University,
Bethlehem, PA, USA,) (Table S7) [59]. The parameters for the PLP were partially obtained
on the aforementioned web server, and parameters were also adopted from source [60] and
empirically selected. A special patch in the topology files was used to describe the Schiff
base between the PLP and K158. The phosphate group of the PLP was doubly negatively
charged, the O3′ atom was deprotonated, and the Schiff base was protonated. The system
was then solvated and ionized. The geometry configuration of the model system was
optimized for 20,000 steps.
The visual inspection of the modeled structures and figure preparation were carried
out by the PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.4. (Schrödinger, New York,
NY, USA, assessed on 14 May 2025). Multiple structural alignment was performed using
MUSTANG: A Multiple Structural alignment algorithm, Version 3.2.4 (Arun Konagurthu,
Monash University, Australia, accessed on 16 March 2025) [61].

5. Conclusions
The PLP-dependent fold type IV transaminase fromDesulfomonile tiedjei (DestiTA) was
functionally characterized, including a detailed analysis of the contribution of second-shell
residues to PLP binding and holoenzyme stability. Although DestiTA belongs to group
II DATAs, in the catalytically important dyad, it retains only the first-shell conserved
arginine residue (R37), while the second position is occupied by a negatively charged
aspartate residue (D103). This combination is typical of a subfamily of (R)-ATAs; however,
DestiTA does not catalyze the amination of ketones. DestiTA exhibits activity toward
some D-amino acids and (R)-phenylethylamine. Site-directed mutagenesis of residues in
the second shell near the PLP-binding site was performed based on structural modeling
and sequence analysis of homologous transaminases. The T43E substitution in DestiTA
drastically reduced the enzyme activity and impaired internal aldimine formation. While
the T199N and T199Q substitutions both preserve the structural features necessary for
catalytic function, only the T199Q variant enhances cofactor affinity. The T199Q variant
demonstrated a fivefold increase in PLP affinity and improved activity under alkaline
conditions. This was attributed to a newly formed hydrogen bond that stabilized the
N1-binding region of PLP . Glutamine at position 199 was not observed in homologous
transaminases, making this non-natural substitution a novel and beneficial modification.
Our findings underscore the contribution of second-shell residues in stabilizing PLP and
promoting the formation of the catalytically active internal aldimine in DestiTA. These
results could be useful for the engineering of PLP fold type IV TAs with improved cofactor
retention and functionality under industrial conditions.
