Natural enzymes are able to function eﬀectively under optimal physiological conditions, but the intrinsic
performance often fails to meet the demands of industrial production. Existing strategies are based
mainly on the evaluation and subsequent combination of single-point mutations; however, this approach
often suﬀers from a limited number of designable residues and from low accuracy. Here, we propose
a strategy (Co-MdVS) based on coevolutionary analysis and multidimensional virtual screening for
precise design to improve enzyme robustness, employing nattokinase as a model. Using this strategy, we
eﬃciently screened 8 dual mutants with enhanced thermostability from a virtual mutation library
containing 7980 mutants. After further iterative combination, the optimal mutant M6 exhibited a 31-fold
increase in half-life at 55 °C, signiﬁcantly enhanced acid resistance, and improved catalytic eﬃciency
with diﬀerent substrates. Molecular dynamics simulations indicated that the reducedﬂexibility of thermal
and acid-sensitive regions resulted in a signi ﬁcantly increased robustness of M6. Furthermore, the
potential of multidimensional virtual screening in enhancing design precision has been validated on
L-
rhamnose isomerase and PETase. Therefore, the Co-MdVS strategy introduced in this research may oﬀer
a viable approach for developing enzymes with enhanced robustness.
1. Introduction
Enzymes, as natural biocatalysts, have substantial potential
for industrial application due to their high specicity, eﬃ-
ciency, and sustainability. 1,2 While natural enzymes can
function eﬀectively under optimal physiological conditions,
their inherent performance is o en insu ﬃcient for the
rigorous demands imposed by industrial processes. 3,4 To
overcome this limitation, several molecular engineering
strategies have been employed. Directed evolution has proven
to be an e ﬀective approach for enhancing enzyme
performance.
5–7 Nevertheless, the widespread utilization of
this strategy has been impeded by the need to develop
proprietary high-th roughput screening systems for various
enzymes and perform subsequ ent extensive screening
work.
8–10 The mechanism-driven strategy of rational or semi-
rational design has been widely and e ﬀectively used in
enzyme engineering,11–13 allowing for virtual screening based
on extensive computations to reduce the experimental
workload.14,15 However, the precise targeting of key residues
for enzyme functions is a critical issue for reliable design.
Proteins from di ﬀerent organisms can be identi ed as
homologs through sequence comparison, as evolutionary
constraints restrict substitutions at speci cp o s i t i o n s .
16
Coevolving residues oen correspond to positions in a protein
that have a signicant impact on its stability.17,18 Therefore,
utilizing the coevolutionary relationships between protein
residues can more accurately reveal key residues that aﬀect
enzyme functions. Moreover, coevolving residues occur in
pairs, providing a convenient method for designing combi-
nations of mutations. Therefore, the coevolution of residues
can be exploited to design algorithms for the eﬃcient target-
ing of hotspot regions and contribute to the design of
combinatorial mutations. However, faced with the enormous
size of mutant libraries, there is an urgent need for more
accurate and labor-saving met hods for screening virtual
mutations. The computation of free energies in biological
processes, such as protein folding, protein –ligand binding,
and protein–protein binding, is crucial for protein design due
to its direct impact on protein stability.
19–21 Introducing
mutations that decrease the folding free energy (DDG)h a s
been shown to eﬀectively increase the melting temperature,
stabilize the protein structure, and therefore extend the half-
life ( t
1/2) at high temperatures. 22–24 However, extensive
research has shown that using DDG as a static indicator is

insuﬃcient for accurately screening highly stable
mutants.23,25,26 Previous reports have demonstrated that
dynamic simulation indicators, such as the root mean square
deviation (RMSD), the radius of gyration (Rg)a n dt h et o t a l
hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), are related to protein structural
stability,
11,27,28 and mutants with a decreased RMSD,
decreased Rg, or an increased number of total H-bonds in
comparison to that of the wild type (WT) oen exhibit greater
robustness. 14,26,29,30 Therefore, by combining the identication
of coevolving residue pairs with multidimensional virtual
screening, it is possible to systematically construct hybrid
strategies that facilitate the identication of elusive combi-
nation mutations and reduce the workload.
Nattokinase (NK), a potent brinolytic enzyme, is a Ca
2+-
dependent serine protease belonging to the subtilisin family
and has great potential in the food and pharmaceutical
industries.
29 However, NK rapidly loses activity at high
temperatures (above 55 °C) a nd under acidic conditions,
while encountering a frequent trade-o ﬀ between enzymatic
activity and stability during the modication process; these
limitations restrict its industrial applications. 11,29,31,32
Although traditional screening methods that involve a heavy
workload have improved the robustness of NK to some extent,
the development of novel approaches for increasing enzyme
performance remains worthwhile.
In this study, we developed a strategy combining the
identication of coevolving residues and multidimensional
virtual screening, namely Co-MdVS, for accurate and eﬃcient
design to enhance NK robustness and greatly reduce the
experimental workload. Furthermore, the MdVS method was
also found to be suitable for screening for high-robustness
mutants of other enzymes. Based on the successful applica-
tion of Co-MdVS, we anticipate that Co-MdVS shows promise
in improving the robustness of enzymes.

The bacterial strains and plasmids utilized in this study are
presented in Table S1.† Escherichia coliJM109 was employed for
plasmid construction and propagation. B. subtilis comK was

cultured in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium consisting of 10 g L−1
tryptone, 5 g L−1 yeast extract, 10 g L−1 NaCl, pH 7.0. For enzyme
expression, 2× YT medium containing 16 g L−1 tryptone, 10 g
L−1 yeast extract, 5 g L−1 NaCl, pH 7.0 was used. The concen-
trations of ampicillin and kanamycin were 100mgm L−1 and 50
mgm L −1, respectively. Tryptone and yeast extract were
purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientic (Waltham, MA, USA),
and ampicillin and kanamycin were purchased from Sangon
Biotech (Shanghai, China). Succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe- p-nitro-
anilide (Suc-AAPF-pNA) was purchased from GlpBio Technology
(Montclair, CA, USA). 20
L-type amino acid standards were
purchased from Sigma (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany). All
other chemicals not specically mentioned were purchased
from Sinopharm Chemical Reagent Co. (Shanghai, China).
2.2. Site-directed mutagenesis
All plasmids were constructed using the Gibson assembly-based
strategy previously described.
34 The secretory expression
plasmid of wild-type NK (pBp43-WapA-NK-ter) was used as
a template to construct mutants through full-length plasmid
PCR. PCR was performed using PrimeSTAR Max DNA Poly-
merase (Takara, Dalian, China). The primers were synthesized
by GENEWIZ Co., Ltd (Suzhou, China) (Table S2†). PCR prod-
ucts were treated with QuickCutTM DpnI (Takara, Dalian,
China) to remove the DNA templates, and then puried using
a DNA Gel Extraction Kit (Cowin Biotech Co., Ltd, Jiangsu,
China). The puried DNA fragments were seamlessly ligated
using ABclonal MultiF Seamless Assembly Mix (ABclonal
Technology Co. Ltd, China), and then transformed intoE. coli
JM109. The constructed plasmids were con rmed by
sequencing (GENEWIZ Co., Ltd Suzhou, China).
2.3. Secretory expression and purication of NK
Single colonies were inoculated into a test tube containing 5 mL
2× YT medium. and cultured at 37 °C for 24 hours. Aer over-
night culture at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm, 1 mL of seed
liquid was transferred into 250 mL shake asks containing
50 mL of 2× YT medium, and further incubated at 37 °C with
shaking at 200 rpm. The supernatant was harvested by centri-
fugation at 12 000 rpm for 5 min. The wild-type and mutant
proteins M5 and M6 were puri ed by precipitation with
ammonium sulfate. The target protein was obtained in the 20–
60% saturation range and solubilized with 100 mM Tris–HCl
(pH 8.0, 0.2 mM CaCl
2). The ammonium sulfate was removed by
dialysis in 100 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0, 0.2 mM CaCl2)b uﬀer. The
purity of the puried enzymes was assessed using SDS-PAGE
analysis. The protein concentration was determined using the
Bradford method.
2.4. Determination of enzymatic parameters
Measurement of enzyme speci c activity, the ability to
degrade ber plates and brinolytic activity. The speci c
activity of NK was measured according to Luoet al.
11 In this
assay, 40mL of the NK sample (fermentation broth supernatant
or puried NK) and 80mL of theN-Succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe p-
nitroanilide (Suc-AAPF-pNA) substrate at anal concentration
of 0.4 mM were incubated in 80mLo fb uﬀer (pH 8.0, 100 mM
Tris–HCl, and 0.2 mM CaCl2). The mixture was then subjected
to analysis using a microplate reader (BioTek Instruments, Inc.
Winooski, Vermont, USA) at 405 nm and 25 °C for 5 minutes,
with p-NA content measured every minute. One unit of enzyme
activity was dened as the amount of enzyme that produced 1
mmol of p-NA per minute under the assay conditions. The
specic enzyme activity, expressed as units of enzyme activity
per milligram of enzyme, was calculated based on the total
number of units. Protein concentration was determined using
the Bradford method.

add 0.5 mL of 20 U mL−1 thrombin. Mix well and pour the
mixture into a plastic Petri dish with a 30 mm diameter. Incu-
bate at 37 °C for 10 minutes, and then place a 5 mm inner
diameter Oxford cup in each Petri dish. Subsequently, add 200
mL of a 0.3 mg mL
−1 enzyme solution into each Oxford cup.
Incubate at 37 °C for 12 hours, and then photograph and
measure the area (ImageJ NIH, USA) of the hydrolysis zone.
NK brinolytic activity was measured according to Liuet al.
29
In this assay, 1.4 mL of Tris–HCl (50 mM, pH 8.0, 0.2 mM CaCl2)
and 0.4 mL of a 0.72%brinogen solution were preincubated at
37 °C for 5 minutes. Then, 0.1 mL of a 20 U mL−1 thrombin
solution (Solarbio Biotechnology Co., Ltd Beijing, China) was
added, followed by the addition of 0.1 mL of puried NK aer 10
minutes. Fibrinogen and thrombin were solubilized with 0.05
mol L
−1 borate buﬀer (pH 8.5). The mixture was incubated at 37
°C for one hour. Aer that, a trichloroacetic acid solution (0.2
M) was added, and the reaction was stopped by incubating at 37
°C for 20 minutes. The mixture was then centrifuged (15
000 rpm, 5 min), and the absorbance of the supernatant was
measured at 275 nm. One unit (1 FU) ofbrinolytic activity was
dened as the amount of enzyme that increased the absorbance
of theltrate at 275 nm by 0.01 per minute. Fibrinolytic activity
was analyzed independently in triplicate, and the data are pre-
sented as mean± standard deviation.
Determination of the hydrolysis degree of casein.Initially,
10 g of casein sample (J & K Scientic, Beijing, China) is accu-
rately weighed, followed by the addition of a solution contain-
ing either WT or mutant NK. This solution is composed of
100 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0, 0.2 mM CaCl
2), to reach a nal
volume of 50 mL. It is essential to maintain the ratio of NK to
casein in the mixture at 0.5% (w/w). The mixture was subjected
to enzymatic digestion by incubating at a constant temperature
of 37 °C and 55 °C with agitation at 250 rpm in a shaking
incubator for 6 hours. The samples were taken every hour and
treated with anal concentration of 0.2 mM PMSF to inactivate
the NK. Subsequently, the mixture is centrifuged at 4 °C and 12
000 rpm for 20 minutes to collect the supernatant for further
analysis.
In this study, the degree of protein hydrolysis (DH) is
quantied using the ninhydrin colorimetric method.
35 The
specic protocol is as follows: 1% ninhydrin reagent solution is
prepared using anhydrous ethanol as the solvent. A 200 mM
amino acid standard mixture solution is then prepared and
serially diluted tonal concentrations of 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 mM.
Next, 100mL of each hydrolysis solution is taken and combined
with 50mL of the 1% ninhydrin reagent, thoroughly mixed, and
then heated at 100 °C for a duration of 10 minutes to initiate the
color development reaction. The absorbance of the reaction
mixture is measured at a wavelength of 570 nm immediately
following the heating process. The quantity of newly formed
peptide bonds in the hydrolysate is calculated by comparison
with the amino acid standard curve. This experimental value is
compared to the innate peptide bond content of casein (8.2 mM
g
−1) to ascertain the DH. This ratio indicates the proportion of
new peptide bonds formed through the hydrolysis of casein
relative to the original peptide bonds, thereby reecting the
extent of protein degradation achieved.
Measurement of residual activity, half-life, and apparent
melting temperatures. The residual activity was dened as the
percentage of crude NK activity that remained aer incubation
at 65 °C for 30 minutes. Briey, 1 mL of crude enzyme super-
natant was incubated at 65 °C for 30 minutes. Aer incubation,
the crude enzyme activity of the supernatant was measured, and
the percentage of residual enzyme activity was calculated.
For the determination of thermostability, the half-life period
(t
1/2) of puried WT, M5 and M6 mutants was determined by
monitoring the time quantum of the half residual activity aer
incubation at 55 °C. 1 mL Tris–HCl (100 mM, pH 8.0, 0.2 mM
CaCl2) containing 0.2 mg mL−1 puried WT and mutants were
incubated at 55 °C, and the total enzyme activity was detected
every 30 minutes until no enzyme activity was detected.
Apparent melting temperatures were determined using
a uorescence-based thermal stability assay.11 The puried NK
solution (20 mL) was added to buﬀer (100 mM Tris–HCl and
0.2 mM CaCl2, pH 8.0) for anal concentration of 0.2 mg mL−1.
The solution was mixed with 5mL of 100-fold diluted SYPRO
Orange dye (Molecular Probes, Life Technologies, USA). The
solution was mixed in low-prole PCR tubes (8-tube strips,
white) with opticalat 8 caps (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc, USA)
and heated in a StepOnePlus™ PCR (Thermo Fisher Scientic,
Applied Biosystems, USA) from 40 to 85 °C at a heating rate of
1% per minute. The changes inuorescence were monitored
with a built-in detector, and the data from the melting region
derivative were obtained using a StepOnePlus™Real-Time PCR
system.
Determination of the tolerance of NK to diﬀerent pH values.
Use seven gradient reaction solutions with pH values of 2.5, 3.0,
3.5, 4.0, 4.5, 5.0, and 5.5, to create NK (0.5 mg mL
−1) working
solutions. Aer incubating the solutions at 37 °C for 30
minutes, adjust the pH of each reaction solution to 8.0.
Subsequently, measure the enzymatic activity ofbrinogen in
the reaction solutions subjected to diﬀerent pH treatments and
calculate the residual enzymatic activity.
Kinetics characterization. The model substrate Suc-AAPF-
pNA was prepared at ten diﬀerent concentrations (0.08, 0.16,
0.32, 0.64, 0.96, 1.28, 1.60, 3.20, 6.40, 9.6, and 12.8 mM) and
used to evaluate the Michaelis–Menten kinetics of WT and
variants. In addition, the specic activity of each substrate was
measured at 25 °C aer maintaining the concentration of the
puried enzyme at 0.005 mg mL
−1 (100 mM Tris–HCl and
0.2 mM CaCl2, pH 8.0). The experimental data weretted using
GraphPad Prism 8.00 (GraphPad Soware Co., USA).
2.5. Evolutionary coupling analysis
Evolutionary coupling amino acid residue pairs were predicted
by an online soware EVcouplings server (http://evfold.org).36 In
this study, EVcouplings was utilized for homologous sequence
searches using the UniRef90 database. UniRef90 is a widely
used non-redundant sequence database, comprising
sequences with less than 90% similarity, thereby reducing
redundancy and enhancing alignment quality. Iterative
searches were conducted using JackHMMER forve iterations.
Subsequently, homologous sequences wereltered based on an

Chemical Science Edge Article
E-value threshold of 1× 10−5, the minimum sequence coverage
threshold: 80%, and the maximum sequence redundancy
threshold: 90%. Eventually, evolutionarily coupled residue pairs
were identied from the 62 032ltered sequences. Based on the
computational results, residues with a Bitscore of 0.5 are
considered reliable coevolutionary analysis data. Therefore, we
selected the top 20 residue pairs based on the strength of
coevolutionary coupling from this dataset for subsequent
analysis.
2.6. Virtual screening based on folding free energy
evaluation
Three-dimensional structures of NK and its mutants were
obtained using the Schrödinger so ware Maestro module
based on the crystal structure of NK (PDB: 4DWW)
37 and the
structures were optimized by using the Rosetta FastRelax
module.
38,39 Prediction of changes in the DDG of mutations
was performed by a customizable Python wrapper Roset-
taDDGPrediction based on the Rosetta cartesian_ddg
module.
40,41 For each residue, mutagenesis to the other 19
typical amino acids was allowed, resulting in a total of 399
saturated combinatorial mutations that need to be screened
for each coevolutionary residue pair. Candidate mutants were
screened out based onDDG (Rosetta Energy Unit, REU), and
those of less than −1.6 REU were considered as potential
positive mutations. The scoring weights of ref2015_cart were
used to calculate the DDG.
42 The iterations were set to 5 (5
independent mutation calculations were performed), and the
results were the average of the 5 calculations to ensure the
accuracy of the predictions (SI_Scripts_for_ddG_Prediction).
2.7. MD simulation and analysis
In this study, MD simulations were performed using NAMD 2.14
soware with the CHARMM36m force eld.
43,44 The initial
structures (PDB ID:4DWW45) were optimized using the Fas-
tRelax module of Rosetta 2021-16 and used as the input for the
MD simulations. PDB2PQR ( https://
server.poissonboltzmann.org/) was used to determine the
protonation state of residues at diﬀerent pH values.46 The MD
simulations were carried out in a rectangular TIP3P explicit
solvent box with a distance of 10 Å between the solute and the
box edge. To neutralize the system, 0.15 M Na
+ and Cl− ions
were added. A time step of 2 fs was used, and a cutoﬀ of 12 Å
was applied for non-bonded interactions. Periodic boundary
conditions and particle mesh Ewald were used during the MD
simulation. The complete MD simulation protocol consisted of
a 1 ns equilibration under an NVT ensemble, heating the system
from 0 K to the target temperature with a gradient of 5 K, and
a 50 ns production MD simulation under the NPT ensemble. For
MdVS, 20 ns production MD simulations at 400 K were used to
reduce the computational cost.
Determination of the protonation state of residues. The
online tool PDB2PQR ( https://server.poissonboltzmann.org/
pdb2pqr)
47 was used to predict the protonation state of Asp,
Glu, and His at pH 3 or 7. The CHARMM force eld was
applied, with the output also in the CHARMM force eld
format. PROPKA48 was used to assign protonation states at
provided pH values. Details of the protonation state of each
residue at pH 3 or 7 are listed in Table S8.†
RMSD analysis. The RMSD of the protein backbone was
calculated using the RMSD Trajectory Tool, a plugin for VMD,
using the initial structure of the MD simulation as a reference.
R
g analysis. The Rg of the protein backbone was calculated
using a set of homemade scripts that were generously provided
by Professor Lukasz Peplowski at Nicolaus Copernicus Univer-
sity in Toru´n, Poland (SI_Scripts_for_R
g_calculation).
H-bond analysis. H-bond formation in the MD simulation
was evaluated using hydrogen bonds, a plugin for VMD. Only
polar atoms (N, O, S, and F) were included; the donor–acceptor
distance cut-oﬀ was set to 3.0 angstroms and the angular cut-oﬀ
to 20°.
Root mean squareuctuation (RMSF) analysis.The RMSF of
the Ca atom of the protein was analyzed using the Bio3D
package, an R package for structural bioinformatics.
49
2.8. Statistical analysis
All experiments were performed in triplicate by independent
investigators;the results are expressed as mean± SD (n = 3).
The signicance of the experimental test data was analysed
using SPSS19.0 (IBM Corporation, New York. USA), and one-way
ANOVA analysis was performed using Duncan's test at the 5%
level. The parameter of MD simulations employed the Kruskal–
Wallis test for analysis at the 5% level.
3. Results
3.1. Proposal and general procedure for Co-MdVS
Mechanism-based rational design is an important approach for
enhancing enzyme properties. In contrast to directed evolution,
rational design does not rely on expensive high-throughput
screening equipment and can reduce labor costs through eﬃ-
cient calculations.
25,50–52 However, there are still several bottle-
necks associated with e ﬀective rational design, including
eﬃcient targeting of functional residues, rapid and accurate
evaluation of the eﬀects of mutations, and eﬀective iterative
combinations. Here, we present a strategy Co-MdVS for the
direct design of combinatorial mutations that begins with
identifying hotspot residue pairs for enzyme engineering based
on coevolutionary analysis, followed by multidimensional
virtual screening of combinatorial saturation mutations and,
nally, validation and further combination of the screened
mutants (Fig. 1).
Coevolutionary analysis is an important method for identi-
fying functional residues and predicting the protein structure
by extracting information about residue pairs that are spatially
and functionally closely related.
17,53 Therefore, in this study,
coevolutionary analysis was used to identify hotspot residue
pairs in Step I. Virtual saturation mutagenesis was subsequently
performed on the residue pairs with strong evolutionary
coupling, yielding a virtual mutant library in Step II. Although
several tools have been developed for the evaluation of muta-
tions in proteins, high-precision design remains a challenge.

The calculation ofDDG based on energy functions tends to be
limited on a spatial scale by considering only interactions
between mutated residues and nearby residues. MD simulation
is a useful method for resolving the eﬀects of mutations on
structural dynamics at the cost of high computational require-
ments. To balance design eﬃciency and accuracy, in Step III, we
used a MdVS strategy ofrst ltering out undesirable mutations
using DDG, followed by identifying benecial mutations using
multiple indicators (RMSD,R
g, and H-bonds) derived from MD
simulations. In Step IV, we conducted mutant validation and
iterative combination.
3.2. Construct a virtual mutant library and determine
potentially benecial mutations
The EVcoupling server was utilized for the identication of
coevolving residue pairs in NK.
36 Coevolutionary information
was derived from the analysis of 62 032 sequences. In total, 253
residues of NK were analyzed (Fig. 2a and b), and the top 20
coevolving residue pairs were selected based on their score
values (Table S3†). By mapping these 20 residue pairs onto the
3D structure of NK, we observed that 11 residue pairs were sit-
uated near the catalytic triad (Asp32, His64, and Ser221), while
the remaining 9 pairs were located on the opposite side (Fig. 2c).
Notably, the residues belonging to each pair were close in space,
with distances between the Ca atoms ranging from 4.1 to 8.4 Å
(Table S3†). The interactions between these residue pairs were
further examined, and the results are shown in Fig. S1. †
Specically, T22-S87 and D140-S173 formed a hydrogen bond
(H-bond), and E112-K141 formed both an H-bond and a salt
bridge. Additionally, V28-I72, V93-W113, A169-A176, A179-F189,
A187-V203, A230-I268, and A230-A270 engaged in nonpolar
interactions. The remaining residue pairs did not exhibit well-
dened interactions. Virtual saturation mutagenesis was per-
formed on the 20 selected coevolving residue pairs to construct
a mutant library.
Experimental validation of the sheer number of possible
combinations resulting from saturated combinatorial muta-
tions on 20 coevolving residue pairs, 7980 in total, would be
prohibitive. Because screening potential stability-enhancing
mutations based on a single indicator has limitations, we
combined a static indicator (DDG) with dynamic indicators
(RMSD, R
g, and total H-bonds) to guide the MdVS of potentially
benecial mutants.11,27,30,54 To facilitate this process, virtual
saturation mutagenesis and calculation of the DDG (Carte-
sian_ddg) values for the variants were performed with a high-
throughput mutational scan python wrapper called Roset-
taDDGPrediction, which utilizes the Rosetta soware Carte-
sian_ddg module.
40 Subsequently, the DDG values were
calculated for 20 pairs of coevolving residues, resulting in
a comprehensive assessment of their potential e ﬀects on
stability (Fig. S2†). Based on the calculation results and previous
reports, a threshold of−1.6 REU was set to identify potentially
benecial mutations, and any mutations below this value were
considered for further analysis.
11,24 Consequently, a total of 80
mutants from 8 pairs of coevolving residues were selected based
on theirDDG values (Fig. S2 and Table S4†). MD simulation was
next proposed to evaluate the eﬀect of mutations on NK ther-
mostability from a structural dynamic perspective. However,

with similar polarity and spatial hindrance, 55 and nally
focused on 40 mutants. (Table S4†). Aerwards, we performed
20 ns conventional MD simulations on 40 selected mutants at
400 K and calculated the RMSD,R
g, and total H-bonds of the NK
structure during the simulation process (Fig. 3a and Table S5†).
The DDG, RMSD, Rg, and total H-bonds are oen used to
characterize the stability of protein structures;11,19,28,56 surpris-
ingly, however, further analysis revealed no signicant correla-
tions among them (Fig. S3†). These results demonstrate that it
is diﬃcult to accurately evaluate mutants based on a single
indicator; therefore, by combining the four indicators, bene-
cial mutants can be predicted multidimensionally, greatly
increasing the accuracy and eﬃciency of screening. Based on
the diﬀerences in these three dynamic indicators, we catego-
rized the 40 mutants into three groups for further analysis. The
rst group consisted of the top 20 mutants with a decreased
RMSD, the second group consisted of the top 20 mutants with
decreased R
g, and the third group consisted of the top 20
mutants with increased total H-bonds. We constructed a Venn
diagram to analyze the similarities and diﬀerences among these
three groups of mutants (Fig. 3b). Notably, 8 dual mutants
overlapped in three groups, namely, T22FS87L, T22FS87W,
T22YS87L, T22YS87Y, K27NS89Y, K27YS89L, K27YS89Y, and
H67AS207V (Fig. 3b and Table S6†). These eight mutants were
considered to have high potential to increase robustness.
According to the Venn diagram, 8 mutants that did not belong
to any of the three groups were excluded (Fig. 3b and Table S6†).
To further evaluate whether this strategy can accurately predict
a mutant with increased robustness, the remaining 24 mutants
included in a single group or in only two of the three groups
were also constructed and characterized (Fig. 3b and Table S6†).
3.3. Characterization and iteration of combinatorial
mutations
To assess the potential for increased catalytic activity and
robustness, the activity of the crude enzyme and the residual
activity aer heat treatment were measured for the mutants. All
of the eight variants identied by the intersection of three
dynamic indicators exhibited higher thermostability than the
WT (Fig. 4a). Specically, the T22FS87L and T22YS87L mutants
exhibited signicantly higher residual activity than did the WT

(Fig. 4a). Surprisingly, none of the remaining 24 mutants dis-
played a thermostability that was signicantly greater than that
of the WT. The T255IN269D mutant exhibited a marked
increase in enzymatic activity compared to the WT, while its
thermostability remained comparable (Fig. 4a). Thesendings
demonstrate the eﬀectiveness and feasibility of MdVS to iden-
tify thermostability-increasing mutations.
Since T22FS87L and T22YS87L involve the same pair of
coevolving residues, they were separately combined with the
mutant T255IN269D to further increase the performance of NK.
Between the two combined mutants, T22FS87LT255IN269D
(referred to as M5) had greater residual activity than
T22YS87LT255IN269D (Fig. 4b). By combining coevolutionary
analysis with multidimensional virtual screening, we obtained
the quadruple point mutant M5 a er only one round of
combination. The specic activity of puried M5 toward N-
Succinyl-Ala-Ala-Pro-Phe-p-nitroanilide (Suc-AAPF- pNA) was
approximately 16% higher than that of the WT (Fig. 4c).
Compared to the WT, M5 showed a signicant increase by
a factor of 3.5 in thet
1/2 of the puried enzyme at 55 °C (Fig. S4†
and 4d). Additionally, the melting temperature ( Tm)o fM 5
increased to 72.9 °C, which was much higher than theTm of the
WT (63.0 °C) (Fig. S4 and S5†). Notably, theTm and t1/2 of the M5
mutant did not correspond exactly. We hypothesize that
mutations distant from the catalytic triad site contribute less to
the t
1/2 of the enzyme. Tm measures the protein unfolding
process, while thet1/2 measures the loss of biological activity,
focusing on active site inactivation. Therefore, theTm and t1/2
are not always correlated,55 as a slight perturbation of the active
site may fully inactivate the protein without signi cantly
aﬀecting the overall folding of the protein. 57,58 Overall, we
successfully obtained the highly robust mutant M5 using the
Co-MdVS strategy. Additionally, all mutations in M5 were
diﬀerent from those in the previously reported mutant M4,
which was obtained through classical strategies
11(Table S7†). To
determine whether Co-MdVS-directed mutations could syner-
gize with those directed by classical strategies to further
improve enzyme robustness, we combined M4 and M5 to obtain
mutant M6 (Table S7†). The puried M6 exhibited a 2.2-fold
increase in catalytic activity towards Suc-AAPF-pNA compared to
the WT, and correspondingly, the M6 showed a 2.5-fold increase
in catalytic activity towards the natural substratebronectin
compared to the WT (Fig. S4† and 4c). Comparatively, thet
1/2 of
puried M6 at 55 °C is 31.0 times that of WT, and the catalytic

eﬃciency (kcat/Km) of puried M6 is approximately 3.2 times
that of WT (Fig. S4, 4d, S6a and c†).
3.4. Validation of the catalytic properties of M6
To evaluate the performance of the M6 engineered in this study
for applications, a comparative analysis ofbrinolytic eﬃciency
between the WT and M6 was conducted. Fibrin plate degrada-
tion assays revealed that, degradation by M6 was noted to be
54.9%, as opposed to 19.6% for the WT (Fig. 5a). In order to
investigate the protein hydrolysis eﬀectiveness of the WT and
M6 in industrial applications, we conducted experiments using
casein as the substrate on a 50 mL scale, while monitoring the
catalytic process. The hydrolysis degree (DH) was utilized as
a metric to assess the eﬀectiveness of hydrolysis (Fig. 5b). Given
that protein hydrolysis in industrial settings typically requires
elevated temperatures,
59 our experiment was carried out at 37 °C
and 55 °C. The results showed that M6 had a better DH of casein
than WT at both temperatures. Following a 6-hour digestion at
55 °C, the DH of M6 reached 27.7%, representing a fourfold
increase compared to that of the WT. These results indicate
that, compared to the WT, M6 exhibits higher eﬃciency in
protein hydrolysis, and due to its excellent thermostability, it
achieves a higher DH during high-temperature and long-term
enzymatic digestion. NK belongs to the family of alkaline
proteases, which typically exhibit low stability in acidic envi-
ronments.
29 However, given the potential application of NK as
a food additive and a pharmaceutical ingredient, its acid
resistance is a crucial characteristic.
32,60 Therefore, this study
investigated the acid resistance of M6. The tolerance of both WT
and M6 under various pH conditions was compared,nding
that at pH 4.5, M6 retained 61.3% residual activity, whereas the
WT's was 2.5%, and even at a pH of 2.5, M6 is able to retain
more than 15% residual activity (Fig. 5c). In summary, M6
displayed superior robustness and catalytic eﬃciency compared
to the WT and thesendings corroborate the advantages of M6
for industrial application.
3.5. Mechanistic analysis of enhanced performance of M6
MD simulations at diﬀerent temperatures (300 K and 400 K) and
pH values (3 and 7) were used to investigate the mechanism that
gives M6 high thermostability and acid resistance. RMSD
analysis showed that WT and M6 possessed similar overall

structural exibility at 300 K and pH 7. At high temperature and
low pH, the structural variations of M6 were signicantly lower
than those of WT (Fig. S7a and b†). By means of RMSF analysis,
we targeted region 202–225 in the WT that were sensitive to both
high temperature and low pH, and this region was rigidied in
M6 (Fig. 6a and b). The increased rigidity of this region was
helpful for improving thermostability, and its help in improving
the adaptability of NK to low pH was characterized in this study.
Besides, theexibility of the N-terminal region of M6 was found
to be enhanced compared to that of the WT both at high
temperature and low pH, indicating a structural exibility
enhancement that allows M6 to maintain backboneexibility
while ensuring stability and catalytic activity. This conversion of
the exible region was demonstrated to maintain high activity
and stability of the enzyme.
11
The catalytic triad (D32, H64 and S221) forms the active site
of NK. D32 positively charges H64 through electrostatic inter-
actions (Fig. 6c) and H64 acts as a general base, deprotonating
S221; then the deprotonated S221 performs nucleophilic attack
on the carbonyl carbon of the amide bond in peptides. The tight
spatial structure among the catalytic triad ensures a suitable
interaction among them. Notably, region 202–225 is spatially
close to the catalytic triad and its uctuations may lead to
structural collapse of the catalytic triad. To validate this spec-
ulation, the distances between D32 and H64 (d(D32–H64)), and
D64 and S221 ( d(H64–S221)) in the last 20 ns of the MD
simulation were statistically represented to reect the structural
stability of the catalytic triad (Fig. 6c). Under mild conditions
(300 K and pH 7),d(D32–H64) was distributed in the range of 3–
4 Å, both in WT and in M6 (Fig. 6d and f). Thed(D64–S221) of
WT and the mutant M6 was also distributed within a smaller
range (2.5–3 Å) (Fig. 6e and g). High temperature and low pH
lengthened d(D32–H64) and d(D64–S221), which may disrupt
the structure of the catalytic triad. However, in M6, the increase
in d(D32–H64) andd(D64–S221) was signicantly smaller than
those in WT. Based on these results, it was reasonable to believe
that a more stable catalytic triad structure was an important
factor contributing to the robustness of M6.
3.6. Exploring the potential application of MdVS
To explore the potential application of the MdVS approach
proposed in this study, reverse validation was conducted using
two enzymes,
L-rhamnose isomerase61 and PETase,23 selected
from previous reports (Fig. S8a and b†). Both of these previous
studies employed initial screening of mutant variants based on
a reduction inDDG, followed by a subsequent combination of
variants. Consequently, we randomly selected six pre-validated
mutants (including both benecial and undesirable mutants)
with reduced DDG values for each enzyme from the mutation
library. Conventional MD simulations were then performed at
400 K for 20 ns for each of the selected variants. We calculated
the RMSD, R
g, and total H-bonds of the enzyme structure for

marked the value of WT. The positive mutants and the negative mutants were shown respectively. All of the positive mutants both inL-rhamnose

each mutant during the simulation process and calculated the
diﬀerences from those of the WT (Fig. 7a and b). According to
the results of the MdVS, we screened threeL-rhamnose isom-
erase mutants (G238R, S239L and L375Y) (Fig. 7a). Notably, all
three of these variants had been previously validated as bene-
cial mutants. The remaining mutants (G57I, S60R and S239F),
which do not satisfy the screening criteria, had been previously
validated as undesirable mutants. Simultaneously, the violin
diagram representing the RMSD distribution for the undesir-
able mutants showed considerable variability (Fig. 7a), sug-
gesting an inability to maintain a stable structure under the 400
K conditions. For PETase, the intersection of the three indica-
tors revealed three variants (Q119Y, I168R and S187W), all of
which had been previously validated as bene cial mutants
(Fig. 7b). Similarly, the remaining mutants (S54W R100F and
T286V), which did not satisfy the screening criteria, were
previously conrmed to be undesirable mutants. A further
violin diagram displaying the RMSD distribution for the unde-
sirable mutants revealed a signicant increase (Fig. 7b), indi-
cating the inability to maintain a stable structure at high
temperatures. Collectively, these results demonstrated the
potential applicability of MdVS in protein design.
4. Discussion
Various strategies have been developed to design mutations to
enhance protein stability or activity, such as FireProt and
PROSS, whose e ﬀectiveness has been widely proven.
62,63
However, the low accuracy of designed mutations remains an
insurmountable obstacle. For instance, we previously employed
FireProt for thermostability improved NK, in which 11 muta-
tions were recommended; however, more than half of them
showed lower thermostability than WT
11. PROSS can be used to
design multipoint mutations with mutation rates typically
ranging from 2% to 12%.
64 However, excessively high mutation
rates may be detrimental to enzyme function, necessitating
stepwise revertant mutations for optimization.
65 Targeting key
residues and the subsequent evaluation of mutants are critical
factors that inuence the accuracy and eﬃciency of the design.
The Co-MdVS strategy proposed in this study employed coevo-
lutionary analysis to target crucial residues and multidimen-
sional virtual screening to accurately evaluate mutations. Based
on Co-MdVS, a handful of NK mutants with increased thermo-
stability and activity were eﬃciently screened from thousands of
theoretical mutations, demonstrating the accuracy and eﬀec-
tiveness of this strategy.
We believe that coevolutionary analysis is of great use in the
design of protein mutations. Coevolving residue pairs usually
exhibit tight interactions that can be disrupted by single point
mutations. For this reason, the conventional evaluation of
single-point mutations rarely yields useful results involving
coevolving residue pairs. Thus, the application of coevolu-
tionary analysis greatly expands the scope of screening for
potential benecial mutations. As demonstrated in this study,
although NK has been previously engineered with satisfactory
results, we nevertheless obtained bene cial mutations at
previously unaltered residues (T22, S87, T255 and N269).
Classically, optimized mutants are obtained based on the
combination of single point mutations, but this approach is
ineﬃcient because it requires multiple rounds of iterative
combinations. Combinatorial mutations can be directly
designed on the basis of coevolutionary analysis, which can
greatly accelerate iterative evolution. We directly designed
double point mutations in NK, and the optimal four-point
mutation M5 was obtained in only one round of combination.
The identication and screening of mutants with improved
properties, such as increased thermostability, require the use of
appropriately selected screening indicators. Additionally, to
ensure the accuracy of the screening process, it is crucial to
ensure that the selected indicators are not signicantly corre-
lated with each other. Only in this way can benecial mutants
with performance-enhancing mutations be accurately and eﬃ-
ciently screened using multiple dimensions. The RosettaDDG is
an energy term that describes the stability of protein folding
aer amino acid mutations in the protein structure.
40 The
calculation of DDG based on energy functions tends to be
limited on a spatial scale. The RMSD andRg of the protein
structure backbone, as well as the total H-bonds, produced from
MD simulation, to some extent better characterize the stability
of the protein structure.
11,28,66 However, long-term MD simula-
tions require massive computational resource consumption. To
balance design eﬃciency and accuracy, we integrated four
diﬀerent dimensional indicators (DDG, RMSD,R
g and total H-
bonds) to screen for potentially benecial mutants. First, the
ddG predicted by the static structure was used to exclude
mutations that were clearly detrimental to structural stability.
Multiple indicators that characterize the structural dynamics of
the protein were then used to identify the desired mutation. The
application of these indicators, which have no signi cant
correlation with each other (Fig. S3†), ensures the accuracy of
the design. Moreover, harnessing computational capacity as an
alternative to experimental testing allowed us to complete the
screening of a virtual library containing 7980 mutants in a few
weeks in this study. In fact, the widespread use of computa-
tional capacity has become a major trend in protein design,
encompassing areas such as structure and function
prediction,
67–69 deep learning of benecial mutations,70,71 and
sequence and conformational ensemble generation,72–74 among
others.
Obviously, Co-MdVS can be exibly embedded in other
protein design strategies. On the one hand, coevolutionary
analysis can be used to greatly expand the targeting of crucial
residues that signicantly aﬀect protein function,
75 followed by
the design of mutations for these residues. On the other hand,
MdVS can be applied to the evaluation of mutations that are
designed by diverse strategies. In this study, MdVS was tested
on the previously reported mutations in
L-rhamnose isomerase
and PETase, demonstrating that it contributes to the accuracy
of mutation design. It is reasonable to believe that MdVS can be
applied to the enhancement of catalytic activity, substrate
selectivity, stereoselectivity, and other enzyme properties if
broader types of indicators are introduced, such as protein-
ligand binding free energy, and the distance and angle
between the active site and the attacked group of the substrate.

Chemical Science Edge Article
We found that certain mutants, such as T22LS87L,
K27RS89L, and H67AS207V, though they had reasonable MdVS
indicators, exhibited thermostability comparable to that of the
WT but showed decreased activity (Fig. 4a). Further RMSF
analysis indicated that these mutants exhibited enhanced
rigidity near the active site (region 210–220) compared to the
WT (Fig. S9a and b†). These results suggested that increased
rigidity near the active site may negatively impact enzymatic
activity. This may be due to the fact that enzymes generally
undergo conformational changes during catalysis,
76–78 so
maintaining an appropriate degree ofexibility in the enzyme
structure is key to preserving catalytic activity.
5. Conclusion
Overall, in this study, we integrated coevolutionary information
on residues and multiple indicators of mutant robustness to
develop a strategy, Co-MdVS, for accurate and eﬃcient design
and screening of combined mutants to increase enzyme
robustness. Using this strategy, we accurately enhanced the
robustness of NK. Moreover, we have demonstrated the poten-
tial of this strategy in enhancing enzyme robustness across
various enzymes. By incorporating indicators that can encom-
pass other protein properties, this strategy holds the promise of
achieving broader objectives.
