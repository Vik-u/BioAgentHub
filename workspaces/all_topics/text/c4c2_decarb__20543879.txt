Abstract
Background: Oxaloacetate decarboxylase (OAD) is a member of the Na+ transport decarboxylase enzyme family found
exclusively in anaerobic bacteria. OAD ofVibrio choleraecatalyses a key step in citrate fermentation, converting the chemical
energy of the decarboxylation reaction into an electrochemical gradient of Na+ ions across the membrane, which drives
endergonic membrane reactions such as ATP synthesis, transport and motility. OAD is a membrane-bound enzyme
composed of a, b and c subunits. The a subunit contains the carboxyltransferase catalytic site.
Methodology/Principal Findings:In this report, spectroscopic techniques were used to probe oxomalonate (a competitive
inhibitor of OAD with respect to oxaloacetate) and Na+ effects on the enzyme tryptophan environment and on the
secondary structure of the OAD complex, as well as the importance of each subunit in the catalytic mechanism. An intrinsic
fluorescence approach, Red Edge Excitation Shift (REES), indicated that solvent molecule mobility in the vicinity of OAD
tryptophans was more restricted in the presence of oxomalonate. It also demonstrated that, although the structure of OAD
is sensitive to the presence of NaCl, oxomalonate was able to bind to the enzyme even in the absence of Na
+. REES changes
due to oxomalonate binding were also observed with theac and a subunits. Infrared spectra showed that OAD,ac and a
subunits have a main component band centered between 1655 and 1650 cm21 characteristic of a high content ofa helix
structures. Addition of oxomalonate induced a shift of the amide-I band of OAD toward higher wavenumbers, interpreted as
a slight decrease ofb sheet structures and a concomitant increase ofa helix structures. Oxomalonate binding toacand a
subunits also provoked secondary structure variations, but these effects were negligible compared to OAD complex.
Conclusion: Oxomalonate binding affects the tryptophan environment of the carboxyltransferase subunit, whereas Na+
alters the tryptophan environment of theb subunit, consistent with the function of these subunits within the enzyme
complex. Formation of a complex between OAD and its substrates elicits structural changes in thea-helical as well asb-
strand secondary structure elements.

Introduction
Oxaloacetate decarboxylase is a member of the sodium ion
transport decarboxylase (NaT-DC) enzyme family which also
includes methylmalonyl-CoA, malonate and glutaconyl-CoA
decarboxylases. These enzymes are found exclusively in anaerobic
bacteria where they play a role in energy conversion [1–4]. As an
example, oxaloacetate decarboxylase ofVibrio cholerae catalyses a
key step in the fermentation of citrate, converting the chemical
energy of the decarboxylation reaction into an electrochemical
gradient of Na
+ ions across the membrane. The Na+ gradient
drives endergonic membrane reactions such as ATP synthesis,
solute transport and motility.
Oxaloacetate decarboxylase is a membrane-bound enzyme
complex composed of a (OadA, 63–65 kDa), b (OadB, 40–
45 kDa), andc (OadG, 9–10 kDa) subunits in a 1:1:1 ratio (Fig. 1)
[5,6]. The a subunit is soluble and comprises three domains
connected by a 40 amino acids long flexible linker peptide with a
high content of proline and alanine residues [7]. The N-terminal
domain of about 450 amino acid residues contains the carboxyl-
transferase catalytic site. The C-terminal domain of 70 amino
acids contains the biotin-binding domain. The a subunit

association domain is tightly bound to the C-terminal domain of
the c subunit, ensuring assembly and stability of the oxaloacetate
decarboxylase complex [8]. Up to date, OAD structural
knowledge is limited to the carboxyltransferase domain of thea
subunit which shows a dimer ofa8b8 barrels with an active site
Zn2+ ion at the bottom of a deep cleft [9]. Based on this structure
and on that of the related 5 S subunit of transcarboxylase fromP.
shermanii [10] and on additional biochemical experiments, it has
been proposed that oxaloacetate binds to the Zn2+ containing site,
and that the carboxyl group in position 4 is transferred to lysine
178 [9]. According to this scheme, pyruvate formed is subse-
quently replaced by the prosthetic biotin group which takes over
the carboxyl group from the carbamylated lysine residue. A
putative role of thec subunit which also contains a Zn2+ ion and
enhances the carboxyl transfer reaction is to stabilize the
chemically labile carboxybiotin during its transfer from the
carboxyltransferase site on subunit a to the decarboxylase site
on subunit b. The b subunit is a very hydrophobic integral
membrane protein that catalyses the decarboxylation of carbox-
ybiotin coupled to Na
+ ion transport across the membrane
[11,12]. The sequence of events taking place during oxaloacetate
decarboxylation is depicted in Fig. 1a [13].

Oxaloacetate decarboxylase is a membrane-bound enzyme complex composed ofa, b, andc subunits in a 1:1:1 molar ratio. Thea subunit is soluble
and harbors the carboxyltransferase catalytic site. The carboxyl group from position 4 of oxaloacetate is transferred to the biotin prosthetic group
bound to the C-terminal biotin-binding domain. The carboxybiotin formed switches to the decarboxylase site on subunitb, where decarboxylation
takes place and free biotin is regenerated, using one periplasmic proton. During the reaction, two sodium ions are translocated from the cytoplasm
into the periplasm. Adapted from [9].b. Structure of the carboxyltransferase domain of OADa subunit highlighting the position of

Substrate Effect on OAD
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 June 2010 | Volume 5 | Issue 6 | e10935
In this report, we used spectroscopic techniques to probe
binding of two known OAD ligand: oxomalonate and Na +.
Tryptophan fluorescence is one of the most widely used tools to
probe tertiary structure fluctuations and dynamics of proteins. In
order to evidence modifications that do not translate into
variations of emission spectra, we used Red Edge Excitation Shift
(REES) measurements, a phenomenon based on the electronic
density redistribution under light absorption. REES refers to the
increase in the emission wavelength occurring when the excitation
wavelength is shifted towards the red edge of the absorption band.
This increase arises from the slow rate of solvent relaxation around
the excited-state fluorophore (tryptophan), which depends on the
restriction imposed on the motion of solvent molecules in its
immediate vicinity [14–16]. It does not provide information on the
tryptophan itself, but rather on the organisation and the dynamics
of the tryptophan environment. Thus, it becomes possible to
monitor the environment-induced motional restriction imposed on
the solvent molecules in the fluorophore vicinity.
Among OAD tryptophans, four residues (at position 45, 50, 67,
160) are all located near the surface of the catalytica8b8 subdomain
in the carboxyltransferase domain of thea subunit. A fifth tryptophan
(W448) is located in the noncatalytic subdomain (Fig. 1b). Although
n o n eo ft h e s et r y p t o p h a n si sw i t h i nt h ea c t i v es i t e[ 8 ] ,s o m eo ft h e m
could be sensitive to dynamic modifications induced by ligand
binding. No tryptophans are present in thec subunit whereas theb
subunit only contains one tryptophan in position 18.
Our findings show that oxomalonate binding affects tryptophan
environment of the carboxyltransferase, whereas Na
+ ions alter the
tryptophan environment of theb subunit. These results are consistent
with the function of these subunits within the enzyme complex. FTIR
spectroscopy permitted us to monitor secondary structure modifica-
tions likely to occur after substrate binding [17,18]. After oxomalo-
nate binding, the OAD amide I absorption band components were
shifted toward higher wavenumbers interpreted as a slight modifi-
cation of thea helix overb sheet ratio.
Results
Tertiary structure changes caused by the binding of
oxomalonate to OAD
Oxomalonate is a competitiv e inhibitor of oxaloacetate
binding to the carboxyltransferase site on the OADa subunit.
To monitor structural changes elicited by inhibitor binding to
this site, we measured fluores cence spectra of oxaloacetate
decarboxylase and of its subunits in the absence or presence of
the inhibitor. The oxaloacetate decarboxylase holoenzyme ofV.
cholerae , consisting of the three subunits a, b and c in a 1:1:1
ratio, showed a typical tryptophan fluorescence spectrum with
an emission maximum at 338.1 nm, when excited at 295 nm at
20uC (Fig. 2, black circles). In the presence of oxomalonate
(Fig. 2, grey triangles), a shift of maximum emission wavelength,
from 338.1 to 336.7 nm was observed, indicating a conforma-
tional change by which one or more of the tryptophan residues
becomes less exposed to the aqueous environment. This result
and the concomitant decrease of fluorescence emission intensity
could also suggest involvem ent of some of the tryptophan
residues in the interaction process. In order to obtain further
information, based on the rela xation rate of tryptophan-
surrounding solvent molecules and not on tryptophan itself,
we also measured the dependence of the emission wavelength
position upon excitation wavelength shift.
Typical REES results are depicted in Fig. 3 and indicate a+7.2 nm
shift in the absence of inhibitor (Fig. 3, black rectangles), from 335.8
to 343 nm, when changing the excitation wavelength from 275 to
307 nm. Such a REES indicates that fluorescence emission occurs
before the dipolar relaxation due to restrictions of tryptophan-
surrounding solvent molecule mobility in some areas of the protein.
After addition of 10 mM oxomalonate, the fluorescence
maximum emission wavelength was blue-shifted by 1.6 nm when
using a 275 nm excitation wavelength and red-shifted by 2 nm
when using a 307 nm excitation wavelength with respect to OAD
alone, leading thus to a 10.8 nm REES (Fig. 3, grey rectangles).
This highlights modifications of the tryptophan-environment
polarity and of tryptophan-surrounding solvent mobility. This
effect of oxomalonate consisted in a decrease of solvent motion as
expected in a non-fluid medium. Thus, ligand binding seemed to
stiffen the tryptophan microenvironment, which is consistent with
a change in the protein structure and more specifically a change of
microenvironment in tryptophan residues.
Effects of oxomalonate binding on the tertiary structure
of the a subunit
Spectroscopic measurements were also performed with OADa
subunit biotinylated or not (Fig. 4). The biotin-freea subunit and
the biotin-containing a subunit showed a REES of +6.9 and
+5 nm, respectively, indicating a restricted mobility of tryptophan
surrounding solvent molecules in these proteins (Fig. 4, a and b).
The 1.9 nm REES shift in the biotinylated vs. biotin-free protein
reflects some release in the motional restrictions of the solvent
molecules around tryptophan residues. OADa subunit was able to
bind oxomalonate as shown by the REES change from 6.9 nm to
9.4 nm (biotin-free) and from 5 nm to 9.4 nm (biotinylated)
leading thus to a +2.5 nm or +4.4 nm REES shift, respectively
(Fig. 4, c and d). Oxomalonate binding induced a similar REES
effect on the whole OAD complex and on thea,o r ac subunits.
We can then argue that the effect mainly concerned residues
located in the a subunit (5 tryptophan residues, some of them
located in the vicinity of the catalytic site) and to a lesser extent the

single tryptophan residue of the beta subunit. The spectroscopic
shifts observed upon oxomalonate binding to the oxaloacetate
decarboxylase holoenzyme can thus largely be attributed to
structural changes in thea subunit.
Effects of oxomalonate binding on the tertiary structure
of the a subunit and ac complex of OAD
To understand the mechanism of substrate binding to OAD and
the importance of each subunit in the catalytic mechanism, the
effect of thec subunit on thea subunit’s fluorescence properties
was determined. As the c subunit does not contain tryptophan
residues, any effect on the fluorescence spectrum is to be attributed
to structural changes within the a subunit. The ac complex
exhibited a huge +44.4 nm REES (emission was shifted from
334 nm to 378.4 nm when excitation was shifted from 275 nm to
307 nm) (Fig. 5 a and b, black rectangles). Oxomalonate interacts
with this complex and induced a further+12.4 nm shift of the
REES (Fig. 5 a and b, white rectangles). These results are
consistent with the notion that oxomalonate binding to the a
subunit is not significantly influenced by the formation of
complexes with the other subunits.
Effects of Na+ ions on the tertiary structure and
decarboxylase activity of OAD
The effects of NaCl on both the structure of the enzyme and its
ability to interact with oxomalonate were investigated. For this
purpose, OAD was purified using 250 mM KCl buffer instead of
NaCl. Under those conditions, OAD exhibited a 3.8 nm REES
(not shown). Addition of 250 mM NaCl to this sample induced a
further 3.4 nm REES variation (Fig. 6A b). Of interest, although
OAD was active in 250 mM potassium chloride buffer, the
decarboxylase specific activity increased from 4.5 U/mg in KCl-
containing buffer to 21 U/mg in the presence of NaCl.
Finally, oxomalonate binding to OAD purified in a KCl-
containing buffer induced a 3 nm REES variation (Fig. 6A c).
These findings indicated that OAD tertiary structure was sensitive
to the presence of NaCl, although oxomalonate was still able to
bind to the enzyme even in the absence of sodium ions.

subunits of OAD

subunit (Fig. 6B b), the wholea subunit (Fig. 6B c) andac complex
(Fig. 6B d) compared to the above described increase observed for
the OAD complex (Fig. 6B e). This indicated that in the absence of
the b subunit, sodium ions did not affect the mobility of
tryptophan-surrounding solvent molecules.
Secondary structure of OAD,ac and a subunits
The spectra of OAD (Fig. 7a) and ofac complex (Fig. 7b), as well
as those of biotinylaled and non-biotinylateda subunit (Fig. 7c and
7d) exhibited a main component band around 1655—1650 cm21,
characteristic of a high proportion ofa helix structures [19,20].
However, thea helix band of theOAD is centered at 1655 cm21
(Fig. 7a) instead of 1651 cm21 for thea and ac subunits (Fig. 7b, 7c,
and 7d). Indeed, fitting curves of the amide I band ofa,w i t ho r
without biotin, as well asac complex show main bands at 1650–
1651 cm21 characteristic ofa helices (Figure S1). Minor component
bands were located at<1635 cm21, 1640–1641 cm21 and 1685–
1675 cm21. This suggested the presence of random structures
(1640 cm21) and of a small amount ofb sheet (1635 cm21 and 1685–
1675 cm21) [7,12] in thea subunit (Fig. 7c and 7d) and in theac
complex (Fig. 7b).
In the case of the OAD complex,b sheet contribution becomes
more important, with two shoulders at 1629 and 1635 cm21 as
determined using the second derivative method (not shown). Other
bands, corresponding to COO
- vibrations of aspartate and
glutamate (1587–1566 cm21), and tyrosine residues (1515 cm21)
[24], are observed together with the amide-II band centered at
1546–1547 cm
21.

A small band around 1739 cm21, related to ester carbonyl
stretching mode, is visible on botha, acand OAD infrared spectra
(Fig. 7). This band was tentatively attributed to the ester group of
Tween 20, remaining lipids from the purification process or
protonated aspartic acid residues.
Comparative secondary structural effects of oxomalonate
binding to OAD,ac and a subunit
Secondary structural effects of oxomalonate binding on OAD,
ac,o r a with or without biotin were also assessed using FTIR
spectroscopy. Our results revealed that, in the presence of
oxomalonate, band components of OAD were shifted as
compared with the individual protein spectrum (Fig. 8 a), namely
from 1655–1651 cm21 to 1653–1648 cm21 for a helices and from
1631 to 1635 cm21 for b sheets.
In addition, other subtle changes can be seen in the 1648 cm21
and around 1700 cm21 region, which can be associated with slight
variations in the loop andb sheet structures of the protein.
Binding of oxomalonate to theac complex induced a shift in the
amide I band vibrations from 1648 to 1651 cm21, as well as a
small change from 1639 to 1641 cm21 (Fig. 8b). Changes also
occurred in the amide II region with shifts of band vibrations from
1550 to 1546 cm21 (Fig. 8) and from 1516 to 1514 cm21(not
shown).
Minor modifications also occurred in the COO- vibrations of
Aspartate and Glutamate, with a shift from 1580 to 1577 cm21
(Fig. 8).
Concerning thea subunit, no major difference can be observed
in the spectra obtained either in the presence or absence of
oxomalonate (Fig. 8c). However, when the a subunit was
biotinylated, spectra presented almost exactly the same differences
than those observed with the OAD complex, indicating that, after
oxomalonate binding, the biotinylated a subunit underwent
smaller, but similar structural changes to those observed on the
OAD (Fig. 8d). Indeeda helix and random structure-correspond-
ing vibrations respectively shifted from 1649 cm 21 and
1638 cm21 in the absence of oxomalonate to 1652 cm21 and
1644 cm21 in its presence. Hence, formation of complexes
between the protein and its substrate appear to generate structural
changes in thea-helical as well asb-strand secondary structural
elements.
Effects of Na+ ions on the secondary structure of the
OAD complex
The IR spectrum of OAD in the absence of Na+ (OAD purified
in KCl 250 mM buffer) showed main bands at 1653 cm 21,
corresponding to a helix vibration, as well as at 1645 cm21,
related to random structures (Fig. 9a, red line). After addition of
Na+, the a helix vibration band was shifted to a higher
wavenumber, 1655 cm21, and bands corresponding tob sheets
appeared at 1682, 1635 and 1629 cm21 (Fig. 9a, blue line). These
values corresponded to the ones determined for the protein
purified in the presence of Na+ (Fig. 8a). The 1579 cm21-COO-
vibration band, observed in presence of Na+ ions, was shifted to
1576 cm21 in the absence of Na+. The effect of oxomalonate in
the absence of NaCl was less important than the effect observed in
the presence of NaCl (Fig. 9b).
Discussion
Tertiary structure of NaT oxaloacetate decarboxylase:
effect of cation and/or substrate binding
Among various fluorescence techniques, fluorescence quench-
ing, resonance energy transfer, and polarization measurements
yield information about the fluorophore itself, while REES
provides information about the relative rates of solvent (water in
biological systems) relaxation dynamics, which is not possible to
obtain by other techniques. Since the dynamics of hydration are
directly associated with the functionality of proteins, REES is a
sensitive tool to explore the organization and dynamics of soluble
and membrane proteins.
It is usually assumed that fluorescence emission occurs, after
dipolar relaxation, from a relaxed state and thus that the emission
wavelength is independent from the excitation (Kasha rule) [21].
However, in a more viscous medium, aromatic fluorophore
fluorescence spectra can depend on the excitation wavelength
[22]. Such an excitation wavelength dependency of emission
spectra was specifically found with proteins exhibiting a fluores-
cence maximum between 325 and 341 nm [23–25]. Due to
solvent motional restriction, the fluorescence life-time of molecules
is shorter than solvent relaxation life-time. Thus, emission of
fluorescence directly occurs from the excited state. The shift of the
excitation wavelength to the red edge and far anti-Stokes region of
the absorption spectra induces a red shift of the maximum
emission wavelength of the fluorophore, leading to the so-called
Red Edge Excitation Shift effect (REES). (For in-depth review see
reference [22]).
In this present work, the REES exhibited by the OAD (around
7 nm), in the absence of any substrate is consistent with an
interfacial localization of tryptophan residues, exhibiting slow
solvent relaxation processes [26]. These interfacial regions are
known to participate in charge-charge, as well as in hydrogen
bonded, intermolecular interactions [27].
The higher REES observed when OAD was in the presence of
oxomalonate (+3.6 nm) indicated that the average microenviron-

ment of tryptophan residues became more ordered, showing an
interaction between those compounds, as well as structural
modifications (Fig. 3). Moreover, some of the enzyme tryptophan
residues were directly affected by oxomalonate binding, as shown
by both the 2 nm blue shift of the emission wavelength from 338
to 336 with 295 nm excitation wavelength and the clear
fluorescence intensity quenching (Fig. 2). Those changes could
also correspond to a minor modification of tryptophan ‘‘embed-
ding’’ in the new conformation.
The carboxyltransferase domain contains four tryptophan
residues (at position 45, 50, 67, 160) which are all located near
the surface of the catalytica8b8 subdomain and could therefore be
responsible for the signal shift. The fifth tryptophan (W448) which
is located in the noncatalytic subdomain is thus less likely to

contribute to the fluorescence quenching by the inhibitor binding
(Fig. 1b).
Taking these structural data into account, our spectroscopic
results suggest that oxomalonate elicits global structural changes
within the carboxyltransferase affecting the dipolar relaxation rate
change of solvent molecules surrounding the whole tryptophan
population and thus mobility of those solvent molecules at the
surface of the protein.
The 7.2-nm (Fig. 3) and 3.4-nm REES (Fig. 6) observed for
OAD in NaCl and in KCl buffer, respectively, attributed to the
relaxation of the protein-water dielectric environment of the
fluorophore residues, indicated that the average environment of
the tryptophan residues in the OAD is less dynamic in the
presence of sodium ions than in the presence of potassium ions.
These observations are consistent with a specific effect of sodium
ions on theb subunit and a direct implication of this subunit in the
sodium translocation process [11]. Indeed, sodium replacement by
potassium only affected theb subunit of the OAD complex as a
REES effect was observed with neither thea subunit nor theac
complex (Fig. 6B) after cation-replacement.
Whatever the structural effect of Na
+ ions, it did not affect
oxomalonate binding to OAD, as shown by the 3 nm REES
variation observed in Fig. 6Ac. Moreover, besides the fluidity
change, decarboxylase specific activity of the enzyme increased 4
to 5 times in the presence of NaCl as compared with KCl. Thus,
our findings indicated that REES changes are sensitive to the
nature of univalent cations, suggesting that REES could indirectly
probe the dynamics of the active site.
Secondary structure of OAD and of the different OAD
subunits association
As shown above, fluorescence measurements strongly suggest
that the conformation of the enzyme subunits changes when
assembled in the OAD complex, as well as upon substrate binding.
The structure of each subunit and the effect of substrate binding to
the protein complex were therefore investigated by means of FTIR
spectroscopy.
The strong absorption in the 1660–1650 cm
21 interval range
(amide I mode) and around 1540 cm21 (amide II mode) displayed
by the different enzyme complexes indicated that secondary
structure of OAD, was dominated by high a helices content
[28,29]. A close analysis of OAD and OAD subunits spectra
however reveals the presence of absorption bands at two distinct
frequencies in the 1660–1650 cm21 range: at 1651 cm21 for a, a-
biotin and ac complex and around 1655 cm21 for the OAD
complex. This can either be due to a shift ofa helix absorption
towards higher wavenumbers or to the co-existence of two types of
a helical structure. A fit of the amide I band of the OAD complex
in agreement with the last hypothesis is presented in Figure S1.
This result bears some similarity with the a-helical signal of
bacteriorhodopsin, in which two major bands can be distinguished
at 1669 and 1658 cm
21 [30,31]. The coexistence of twoa helical
structures at 1658 and 1650 cm-1 was suggested in the secretory
phospholipase A2 once bound to lipid bilayers [32]. The band at
1658 cm
21 could correspond to more flexible and more dynamic
a helices than the 1650 cm 21 one. It is thus an attractive
possibility that the IR absorption bands in the 1660–1650 cm21
interval of the OAD may arise from differenta-helical components
coexisting in the structure of the functional enzyme.
Additional bands were present in the amide I region, although
their interpretation is more complex. The additional band at
1646/1647 cm21 could arise from either 310 helices (i.e. type IIIb
turns), open loops, or even strongly H-bonded a helices
[29,33,34]. The bands at 1638 and 1629 cm21 can be considered
as a mixture ofb sheets, 310 helices and open loops [29,33].
Secondary structure spectra of thea subunit as well as theac
subunit (Fig. 8) were also dominated bya helices. Interestingly, no
drastic effect from the biotinylation process was observed on thea
subunit secondary structure. In the same way, although the c
subunit significantly affects the tryptophan-surrounding solvent
molecule mobility and viscosity, as shown by the huge 44.4 nm
REES effect indicating perturbation of the overall tertiary
structure of the a subunit (Fig. 5), no significant changes were
observed between a and ac subunit secondary structures (Fig. 7).
Indeed, in the amide I region,a and ac spectra are superimposed.
A 1574–1579 cm21 shift can be observed for thea and ac spectra
as compared to the OAD spectrum. OAD,a, and ac subunits
respectively contain 100, 75 and 78 groups susceptible to absorb in
the 1580 cm
21 region. This shift could therefore be related to a
change in the Asp/Glu ratio.
In the presence of theb subunit, a modification in thea helix/b
sheet ratio was observed, with an increase in thea helix content
and structural rearrangements affecting b sheets. This intermo-
lecular b sheet formation could originate from structural
modification imposed by theb subunit on the complex, leading
to perturbation ofa helices and formation of newb sheets. They
could also reflectb sheet presence in theb subunit. Thoseb sheets
could correspond to the undefined part of the predicted structure
between helix III and IV [11,35]. In the absence of Na
+ ions, theb
sheet absorption band in the 1629–1635 cm21 region was less
important (Fig. 9a). However, addition of Na+ to this sample
induced an increase in the absorption band in this spectral region
(Fig. 9b). As REES measurements indicated that Na+ binding
mainly affected theb subunit, this result supports the hypothesis
that the absorption bands at 1628 and 1631 cm21 mainly reflectb
sheet presence in theb subunit.
Effect of oxomalonate binding on the OAD secondary
structure
Effects of oxomalonate binding on OAD,ac,o r a secondary
structure were also assessed using FTIR spectroscopy.
Results revealed the formation of a complex between the
protein and its substrate which appears to generate structural
changes in the a-helical as well asb-strand secondary structure
elements. Indeed, in the presence of oxomalonate, the main band
components of OAD were shifted compared with the individual
protein spectrum (Fig. 8a). These changes resulted from an
environmental alteration implying a decrease of hydrogen bonding
strength within a helices and betweenb-strands [29].
Other spectral peaks suggest changes in the protonation state
and/or environment of acidic residues as well as modification in
the contribution of other side chain residues [36]. Changes in the
Arg side chain may give rise to a peak at 1671 cm
21 [36]). Small
peaks at 1622 and 1614 cm21 might be a mixture of absorption
bands of Asn, Gln, Trp, Tyr side chains and of b sheet
components.
Some of these effects were less important with isolated OAD
subunits. As shown in fig. 8b, although the observed shift is weaker
than in the case of OAD, oxomalonate was able to bind to theac
complex and provoke structural variations. Plots of a subunit
spectra in the absence or presence of oxomalonate did not show
significant differences (slight shift 1649–1651 cm 21) (Fig. 8c).
However, when thea subunit was biotinylated, we observed the
same features than with OAD, suggesting that most of the spectral
structural effects observed upon oxomalonate binding to OAD did
indeed occur within thea subunit (Fig. 8d).

Materials and Methods
Recombinant DNA techniques and sequencing
Extraction of plasmid DNA, restriction enzyme digestions,
DNA ligations, and transformation ofE. coli with plasmids were
carried out by standard methods [37,38]. PCRs were performed
with an air thermo-cycler (Idaho Technology, model 1605) using
Pfu polymerase. The oligonucleotides used were custom-synthe-
sized by Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland). All inserts derived
from PCR as well as ligation sites were checked by DNA
sequencing according to the dideoxynucleotide chain-termination
method [39] by Microsynth (Balgach, Switzerland).
Construction of expression plasmids for thea subunit or forac
subunit was done as described in [8].
Strains and growth conditions
For general cloning purposes Escherichia coli DH5a (Bethesda
Research Laboratories) was used. Recombinant proteins were
synthesized in E. coli C43(DE3) [40] andE. coli BL21 Star(DE3)
cells (Invitrogen). Cells were routinely grown in Luria Bertani
medium (LB) supplemented with 10 g/l NaCl. To increase
biotinylation efficiency, culture medium contained 10
mM( +)-D-
biotin. Expression was induced with 100mM IPTG and the cells
were harvested after 3 to 4 h at 30uC and 180 rpm.
Separation of cytosolic and membrane fraction
For the preparation of cell extracts, cells from expression
cultures (1 g wet weight) were resuspended in 7 ml buffer
containing 0.2 mM diisopropylfluorophosphate and 50mg DNase
I as described in (8). After three passages through a French
pressure cell at 110 MPa intact cells and cell debris were removed
by centrifugation (30 min at 130006g). The cell-free supernatant
was subjected to ultracentrifugation (1 h at 2000006g) to separate
the cytosolic fraction and the membrane fraction.
Purification of biotinylateda or ac.
The purification process was performed as previously described
(8). Appropriate plasmids were expressed inE. coli C43(DE3). The
cells were resuspended in buffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0,
50 mM NaCl) containing 1 mM MgK
2EDTA. The cytosolic
fraction was prepared as described above and applied to a
monomeric avidin-Sepharose column, which was washed with 8
bed volumes of buffer A. Biotinylated protein was eluted with 1
bed volume of buffer A containing 5 mM (+)-D-biotin.
Purification of non-biotinylateda or ac
Cells from expression cultures ofE. coli C43(DE3) containing
the appropriate plasmids were suspended in HisBind buffer
(500 mM NaCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0,) containing 1 mM
MgK
2EDTA. The cytosolic fraction was prepared as described
above and applied to a Ni-NTA agarose column which was
washed with 15 and 11 column volumes HisBind buffer containing
5 and 10 mM imidazole, respectively. Specifically bound protein
was then eluted with 5 column volumes HisBind buffer containing
150 mM imidazole. The biotinylated fraction of a or ac was
removed by passing the eluate through an avidin-Sepharose
column. The biotin-free protein running through the column was
dialyzed overnight against 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, and 50 mM
NaCl at 4uC.
Purification of OAD from V. cholerae cells
OAD was purified fromV. cholerae cells grown anaerobically on
citrate as previously described [41,42]. Briefly,V. cholerae cells were
disrupted by sonication and the cell lysate centrifuged (200 0006
g, 1 h) to collect the membranes. Membranes were resuspended in
50 mM Tris-HCl 250 mM NaCl buffer, pH 8.0, and solubilized
by treatment with 2% Triton X-100 for 10 min at 4uC. The clear
supernatant obtained after centrifugation at 2200006 g for 35
minutes was applied to a monomeric avidin-Sepharose column
(5 ml bed volume), equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer,
pH 8.0 containing 50 mM NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20 and 0.05%
Brij58. Biotinylated proteins were eluted with 5 mM (+)-D-biotin.
Concentration of purified protein
Protein was concentrated using a 2 mL anionic exchange
column (Fractogel EMD TMAE 650 (S), Merck) equilibrated with
50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0 containing 50 mM NaCl (a or
ac) or with 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0 containing 50 mM
NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20 and 0.05% Brij58 (holoenzyme). Pure
200 mL protein fractions were eluted with 50 mM Tris-HCl
buffer, pH 8.0 containing 250 mM NaCl, 0.5% Tween 20 and
0.05% Brij58. For experiments performed in the absence of Na+,
NaCl was replaced by 250 mM KCl. Protein concentration was
determined by the BCA protein assay (Pierce, Rockford, IL) using
bovine serum albumin as standard. SDS–PAGE was performed as
described [20]. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-
250 or with silver [21].
Enzyme assay
The decarboxylation activity was determined with the spectro-
photometric assay at 265 nm as described [43].
Fluorescence Measurements
The maximum emission wavelength, recorded between 306 and
550 nm, was measured at an excitation wavelength ranging from
275 to 307 nm with a RF-5001 PC Shimadzu spectrofluorimeter.
The excitation and emission band-pass values were 1.5 and 3 nm
respectively. Spectra were recorded at 20uC, using a 1 cm-path
length thermostated quartz cell. All spectra were corrected by the
baseline spectra of water Raman peak contribution. Every
fluorescence spectrum was representative of at least three
independent measurements.
Infrared Spectroscopy. Protein samples were prepared as previously
described, but the last Fractogel chromatography step was done in
a
2H2O buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, p2H 7.4 and 50 mM
NaCl. The p2H was measured with a glass electrode and was
corrected by a value of 0.4 according to Glasoe and Long [44].
Protein samples in2H2O buffer with or without oxomalonate were
loaded between two CaF2 circular cells, with a 50 mm Teflon
spacer. Infrared spectra were recorded with a Nicolet 510 M
FTIR spectrometer which was continuously purged with dry air.
The infrared cell was thermostated with a water circulation bath.
The resolution was 4 cm21; 256 scans were collected and co-
added per sample spectrum, and Fourier-transformed for each
sample. Every FTIR spectrum was representative of at least six
independent measurements. The infrared spectra of buffer and
residual water vapour were subtracted from the infrared spectrum
of the sample. Band positions were determined using second
derivative spectra. Amide I band of OAD complex and its subunits
was fitted using PeakFit software (Scientific Solutions, Switzerland)
using the second derivative procedure.
