Marine Crenarchaeota represent an abundant component of oceanic microbiota with potential to significantly
influence biogeochemical cycling in marine ecosystems. Prior studies using specific archaeal lipid biomarkers and
isotopic analyses indicated that planktonicCrenarchaeota have the capacity for autotrophic growth, and more recent
cultivation studies support an ammonia-based chemolithoautotrophic energy metabolism. We report here analysis of
fosmid sequences derived from the uncultivated marine crenarchaeote,Cenarchaeum symbiosum, focused on the
reconstruction of carbon and energy metabolism. Genes predicted to encode multiple components of a modified 3-
hydroxypropionate cycle of autotrophic carbon assimilation were identified, consistent with utilization of carbon
dioxide as a carbon source. Additionally, genes predicted to encode a near complete oxidative tricarboxylic acid cycle
were also identified, consistent with the consumption of organic carbon and in the production of intermediates for
amino acid and cofactor biosynthesis. Therefore, C. symbiosum has the potential to function either as a strict
autotroph, or as a mixotroph utilizing both carbon dioxide and organic material as carbon sources. From the
standpoint of energy metabolism, genes predicted to encode ammonia monooxygenase subunits, ammonia permease,
urease, and urea transporters were identified, consistent with the use of reduced nitrogen compounds as energy
sources fueling autotrophic metabolism. Homologues of these genes, recovered from ocean waters worldwide,
demonstrate the conservation and ubiquity of crenarchaeal pathways for carbon assimilation and ammonia oxidation.
These findings further substantiate the likely global metabolic importance ofCrenarchaeota with respect to key steps
in the biogeochemical transformation of carbon and nitrogen in marine ecosystems.

Introduction
Crenarchaeota are abundant in the world’s oceans, comprising
an estimated 20% of all planktonic prokaryotes [1,2]. They are
distributed over a wide depth range, spanning both euphotic
and aphotic zones [3–5], and at least one species,Cenarchaeum
symbiosum, has a symbiotic association with the marine sponge
Axinella mexicana [6]. Given their numerical abundance and
cosmopolitan nature, Crenarchaeota represent an important
constituent of marine ecosystems around the globe.
Organic geochemical biomarkers in the form of lipid
biomass have proven successful for trackingArchaea in marine
sediments and in the water column. Unlike the fatty acid–
derived membranes of bacteria and eukarya, the major
components of archaeal cell membranes are isoprenoid
ether-linked glyceroldiethers or tetraethers [7,8]. Planktonic
Archaea produce glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers [9–11],
including one unique structure crenarchaeol [7,12,13] often
considered a diagnostic biomarker for planktonic archaeal
species. It remains unclear if this compound is unique to
marine Crenarchaeota, or is found in both euryarchaeotal
lineages, too. Radiocarbon analyses of
14C in lipid biomarkers
associated with marine plankton [14], and 13C-labeled
bicarbonate tracer studies [15] suggest that marineCrenarch-
aeota are capable of light-independent autotrophic carbon
assimilation into membrane lipid biomass, an hypothesis
further strengthened by recent single cell phylogenetic
identiﬁcation and autoradiographic veriﬁcation of carbon
dioxide incorporation [16]. The direct incorporation of
dissolved inorganic carbon by marineCrenarchaeota may be
homologous to metabolic properties of more distantly related
thermophilic Crenarchaeota that utilize a modiﬁed 3-hydrox-
ypropionate [17–21] or reductive tricarboxylic acid [22–24]
cycle for autotrophic carbon assimilation.
Assuming marine Crenarchaeota do assimilate carbon auto-
trophically, the energy source utilized for growth must be

consistent with the surrounding chemical environment.
Ammonia (NH3) produced by the decomposition of organic
matter has the potential to provide both nutrient nitrogen
and a source of reducing power. The seasonal distribution of
marine Crenarchaeota in the oxic and ammonia-rich surface
waters off Palmer Station, Antarctica [4], as well as a
correlation of increasing crenarchaeal abundance with a
nitrite (NO
2
/C0 ) maximum are both consistent with the
hypothesis that marineCrenarchaeota are capable of ammonia
oxidation [25]. Whole genome shotgun (WGS) analysis of
DNA sequences derived from the Sargasso Sea (SAR)
identiﬁed potential ammonia monooxygenase (amo) genes
associated with presumptive archaeal contigs supporting this
hypothesis [26]. Another study of fosmids derived from
complex soil libraries identiﬁedamo gene sequences related
to those observed in the SAR, linked to a crenarchaeal
ribosomal RNA operon, and a recent PCR survey has
conﬁrmed the widespread occurance of archaealamoA genes
in marine water columns and sediments [27], reinforcing a
potential and widespread role for ammonia oxidation in
varied archaeal lineages [28]. Recent isolation of a marine
crenarchaeote in pure culture using bicarbonate and ammo-
nia as sole carbon and energy sources strongly supports this
hypothesis [29]. However, the speciﬁc biochemical pathways
mediating ammonia oxidation and carbon assimilation in this
isolate remain unknown.
C. symbiosum, a mesophilic crenarchaeal symbiont of the
marine sponge Axinella mexicana [6] provides a useful system
for modeling the physiology and genetics of marine Cren-
archaeota. Previous studies have determined thatC. symbiosum
constitutes the sole archaeal phylotype associated with A.
mexicana, reaching up to 65% of the total prokaryotic cell
population within a given host [6]. The purity and abundance
of C. symbiosum cells in host tissue has enabled the
construction of fosmid DNA libraries containing its full
genomic repertoire ([30,31] and Hallam et al., unpublished
data). Although C. symbiosum is a sponge symbiont and
therefore at some level adapted to life within its host
environment, it remains phylogenetically clustered with the
planktonic Crenarchaeota [6]. Given this relationship, sequence
data obtained from C. symbiosum genomic libraries can be
used to query and interpret crenarchaeal sequences recov-
ered from the planktonic environment [32,33]. We report
here analyses of unassembled C. symbiosum genomic DNA
sequences, combined with environmental gene and database
surveys, to determine the presence and distribution of highly
conserved genes with the potential to mediate carbon
assimilation and ammonia oxidation in marineCrenarchaeota.
Results
Environmental Genomic Analysis of a Fosmid Library
Enriched for C. symbiosum DNA
C. symbiosum cells were enriched from host tissue using
differential density centrifugation (see Materials and Meth-
ods). High molecular weight DNA puriﬁed from this cell
enrichment was used to construct two 32–45 Kb insert fosmid
DNA libraries composed of 10,236 and 2,100 clones,
respectively [31]. Seven C. symbiosum SSU rRNA genes were
identiﬁed in the ﬁrst library, representing approximately
0.07% of the total clone population. EightC. symbiosum SSU
rRNA genes were identiﬁed in the second library, represent-
ing approximately 0.38% of the total clone population [31].
For a 2 million base pair (Mb) genome containing one copy of
the SSU rRNA gene, approximately 50 fosmids arranged in a
linear tiling path have the potential to cover the entire
genomic sequence. Given this estimate and the percentage of
C. symbiosumSSU rRNA genes identiﬁed in the second library,
approximately 400 of the 2,100 clones in the library should be
derived fromC. symbiosumdonors (;8-fold coverage of a 2-Mb
genome). Paired-end sequencing of the smaller fosmid library
generated 1.8 Mb of DNA sequence from 2,779 nonredundant
reads greater than 200 bp (base pair) per read. A total of 168
fosmids encompassing more than 6.4 Mb of genomic DNA
were selected for subcloning and sequencing based on the
following criteria: (1) paired ends predicted to contain open
reading frames most similar to archaeal genes, (2) linkage
with previously reported fosmids harboring crenarchaeal
phylogenetic anchors, and (3) sets of paired ends, assembled
in opposing orientations and predicted to contain open
reading frames homologous to two or more archaeal genes.
On average, selected fosmids had a GþC content of 58%. In
general, the identity of completed fosmids could be veriﬁed
on the combined basis of G þC content, SSU rRNA, or
functional gene linkage, and the taxonomic distribution of
predicted open reading frames contained on individual
fosmid sequences. Based on this set of criteria, 155 of the
completed fosmids were derived fromC. symbiosum, ten from
unspeciﬁed bacteria and three from host donors.
Overall genomic representation of the dataset was deter-
mined based on the identiﬁcation of complete or redundant
sets of genes encoding ribosomal proteins, amino-acyl tRNA
synthases, and conserved components of several core pro-
cesses including but not limited to the transcription, trans-
lation, and replication machinery identiﬁed within the set of
155 archaeal fosmids. On average, two copies of each gene
within a given category were identiﬁed (unpublished data),
consistent with 2- to 3-fold coverage of an estimated 2-Mb
genome. Previous studies ofC. symbiosumpopulation structure
identiﬁed two coexisting ribotypic variants, a and b, exhibit-
ing approximately 99% nucleotide identity at the ribosomal
level but ranging between 70% and 90% nucleotide identity
in genomic intervals adjacent to the ribosomal operon [30].
Despite this variation in nucleotide identity, gene content
and order appeared to be conserved between the two
ribotypes [30]. The present study focuses on pathways of
autotrophic carbon assimilation and ammonia oxidation,
based on analyses of individual fosmid sequences, and does
not attempt to discriminate between sequences derived from
a or btypes. The issue of heterogeneity and the assembly of a-
type and b-type genomic scaffolds will be the subject of future
work exploring the complete genome sequence of C.
symbiosum (Hallam et al., unpublished data).
Autotrophic Carbon Assimilation Genes inC. symbiosum
In order to identify potential effectors of autotrophic
metabolism in the unassembled C. symbiosum genomic
sequences, systematic searches for each of the four known
pathways of autotrophic CO2 ﬁxation were conducted (see
Materials and Methods). These include: (1) the unidirectional
reductive pentose phosphate cycle [34], (2) the bidirectional
reductive acetyl coenzyme A (CoA) pathway [35], the (3) the
reductive tricarboxylic acid pathway [36], and (4) the
unidirectional 3-hydroxypropionate cycle [37]. Each pathway

Chemoautotrophy in MarineCrenarchaeota
is deﬁned by a subset of diagnostic enzymes. The reductive
pentose phosphate cycle requires the activities of ribulose
1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase, phosphoribulokinase, and se-
doheptulose bisphosphatase [38]. The reductive acetyl-CoA
pathway requires the activity of carbon monoxide dehydro-
genase [39]. The reductive TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle
requires the activities of citrate lyase, 2-oxoglutarate:ferre-
doxin oxidoreductase, and fumarate reductase [40]. Finally,
the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle requires the activities of
acetyl-CoA/propionyl-CoA ca rboxylase [37], malonyl-CoA
reductase [41], and propionyl-CoA synthase [42]. Search
results identiﬁed numerous components of the 3-hydroxy-
propionate cycle and the citric acid cycles (Tables 1, 2, and
S1). Homologues for 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase
(RubisCO), phosphoribulokinase, sedoheptulose bisphospha-
tase, and carbon monoxide dehydrogenase representing the
reductive pentose phosphate cycle and reductive acetyl-CoA
cycle, respectively, were not identiﬁed.
3-Hydroxypropionate Cycle Components Identified inC.
symbiosum
The 3-hydroxypropionate cycle was ﬁrst identiﬁed in the
phototrophic green nonsulfur bacteriumChloroﬂexus aurantia-
cus [37,43] and more recently recognized in several thermo-
philic crenarchaeotes within theSulfolobales [17,18,20,44]. This
pathway employs several enzymes typically associated with
bacterial fatty acid biosynthesis, including the biotin-depend-
ent enzyme acetyl-CoA/propionyl-CoA carboxylase [45]. Be-
cause archaeal lipids are typically devoid of fatty acids, the
presence of acetyl-CoA/propionyl-CoA carboxylase in Cren-
archaeota is necessary but not sufﬁcient evidence for autotro-
phic carbon assimilation by the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle.
Genes predicted to encode components of eight steps
mediating the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle, including acetyl-
CoA/propionyl-CoA carboxylase, were unambiguously iden-
tiﬁed in theC. symbiosum fosmid sequences (Tables 1 and S1
and Figure 1). Fosmids harboring gene sequences predicted
to encode acetyl-CoA/propionyl-CoA carboxylase subunits
could be assembled into a single contig approximately 1.29
million bp in length containing the C. symbiosum SSU-LSU
ribosomal RNA operon, further reinforcing this identiﬁca-
tion scheme (Hallam et al., unpublished data). Four additional
steps represented by malonyl-CoA reductase [41] and
propionyl-CoA synthase [42] could not be deﬁnitively
identiﬁed, in part because the speciﬁc enzymes mediating
these steps remain uncharacterized throughout the archaeal
domain, including those archaeal groups known to express a
fully catalytic form of the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle [18,20].
Despite this challenge, candidates for both enzymes could be
tentatively assigned based on the identiﬁcation of open
reading frames containing conserved domains with putative
pathway-related functions. In addition to core components of
the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle, a biotin ligase(birA) required
for assembly and activation of the carboxylase complex in
vivo was also identiﬁed (Tables 1 and S1). Consistent with
biochemical observations in M. sedula [18,20], homologous
genes encoding succinyl-CoA/malate transferase or L-malyl-
CoA lyase, required for the regeneration of acetyl-CoA from
glyoxylate, were not identiﬁed in the C. symbiosum fosmid
sequences.
In C. aurantiacus, malonyl-CoA reductase activity is asso-
ciated with a bifunctional enzyme containing alcohol
dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase domains, medi-
ating the conversion of malonyl-CoA to 3-hydroxypropionate
via malonate semialdehyde [41]. In theC. symbiosum fosmid
sequences, 14 genes predicted to encode short-chain alcohol
dehydrogenase domains with the potential to mediate
conversion of malonyl-CoA to malonate semialdehyde were
identiﬁed (Tables 1 and S1). One candidate in particular,
identiﬁed on three fosmids (101G10, C03A05, and C04H09),
was found to contain an N-terminal alcohol dehydrogenase
domain 32% identical and 46% similar to the corresponding
interval of malonyl-CoA reductase from C. aurantiacus .
Adjacent to this domain, a 142–amino acid interval, 27%
identical and 40% similar to an aldehyde dehydrogenase
from Mus musculus, was also identiﬁed as potentially involved
in the conversion of malonate semialdehyde to 3-hydrox-
ypropionate.
In C. aurantiacus, propionyl-CoA synthase activity is
associated with a trifunctional enzyme containing CoA ligase,
enoyl-CoA hydratase, and enoyl-CoA reductase domains [42].
Three copies of a gene predicted to encode enoyl-CoA
hydratase, one of three enzymatic steps associated with
propionyl-CoA synthase activity, were identiﬁed in the C.
symbiosum fosmid sequences (Tables 1 and S1). One copy of
enoyl-CoA hydratase, identiﬁed on fosmid C13E07 contained
a 182–amino acid interval 27% identical and 40% similar to
propionyl-CoA synthase from C. aurantiacus . Immediately
upstream of this open reading frame, a second gene
predicted to encode a CoA binding protein related to acyl-
CoA synthase, a potential effector of the indeterminate CoA
ligase step, was also identiﬁed. InC. aurantiacusthe enoyl-CoA
reductase domain of propionyl-CoA synthase belongs to the
family of zinc-binding dehydrogenases that includes
NAD(P)H-dependent crotonyl-CoA reductases [42]. Seven
copies of genes predicted to encode zinc-binding alcohol
dehydrogenases with potential to mediate propionyl-CoA
synthase activity were identiﬁed in theC. symbiosum fosmid
sequences (Tables 1 and S1). One candidate in particular,
identiﬁed on three fosmids (C04F04, C05C02, and C13G08)
was 29% identical and 48% similar to NAD(P)H-dependent
crotonyl-CoA reductase from Silicibacter sp. TM1040. In all
three instances, this gene was found in an operon with a
second gene predicted to encode the beta subunit of citrate
lyase (see below).
Taken together, these observations suggest thatC. symbiosum
has the genetic potential to encode a modiﬁed version of the
3-hydroxypropionate cycle for CO
2 incorporation into
biomass. Biochemical and physiological studies remain
necessary, however, to fully validate this hypothesis and
determine the speciﬁc pathway of acetyl-CoA regeneration in
the absence of a glyoxylate shunt.
TCA Cycle Components Identified inC. symbiosum
The steps of the TCA cycle deﬁne a central clearinghouse
in cellular metabolism, linking the oxidative breakdown of
sugars, fats, and proteins with the production of precursor
molecules for biosynthesis and energy metabolism. Alter-
natively, the TCA cycle can be reversed in certain prokaryotic
organisms, resulting in the formation of oxaloacetate from
two molecules of CO
2, thereby providing an alternative route
for autotrophic carbon assimilation. The enzyme citrate
synthase is responsible for the conversion of oxaloacetate and
acetyl-CoA to citrate in the oxidative branch of the TCA

cycle. The TCA cycle operating in the reductive direction
requires the activity of ATP citrate lyase (also known as ATP
citrate synthase) ﬁrst described inChlorobium limicola [46,47].
ATP citrate lyase is encoded by the genesaclA and aclB, which
when expressed form a heteromeric enzyme complex capable
of cleaving citrate to produce oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA
[48]. An evolutionarily related alternative to ATP citrate lyase
has recently been described i n the hydrogen-oxidizing
thermophilic bacterium Hydrogenobacter thermophilus, media-
ting citrate cleavage in conjunction with the enzymes citryl-
CoA synthase(ccs) and citryl-CoA lyase(ccl) [49,50].
Genes with the potential to encode components of nine
steps mediating the oxidative or reductive TCA cycles were
identiﬁed in theC. symbiosum fosmid sequences (Tables 2 and
S1 and Figure 1B). In addition to core TCA components,
genes encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and
phosphoenolpyruvate synthase were identiﬁed, consistent
with an anapleurotic role for these enzymes in balancing
carbon transfer into and out of TCA-dependent pathways
(Tables 2 and S1 and Figure 1B). No homologue for pyruvate
carboxylase mediating the ATP-dependent carboxylation of
pyruvate to oxaloacetate was recovered from theC. symbiosum
fosmid sequences. A relatively small subset of TCA compo-
nents was not identiﬁed or could not be readily assigned due
to high levels of similarity between close relatives with varying
substrate speciﬁcities. These include subunits of citrate lyase
and ferredoxin oxidoreductase described below.
In the case of the oxidative TCA cycle, a near-complete
pathway for the conversion of citrate to oxaloacetate could
be reconstructed based on the identiﬁcation of at least one
copy of genes predicted to encode citrate synthase, aconitase,
isocitrate dehydrogenase, succinyl-CoA synthase, succinate
dehydrogenase, fumarase, and malate dehydrogenase (Tables
2 and S1 and Figure 1B). Step 5 (see Figure 1B) mediating the
conversion of 2-oxoglutarate to succinyl-CoA could not be
unequivocally determined because of the high degree of
amino acid conservation between the group of ferredoxin
oxidoreductases responsible for synthesis or cleavage of
pyruvate, 2-isoketovalerate, or 2-oxoglutarate (Tables 2 and
S1). Although four fosmids containing operons predicted to
encode 2-oxoacid:ferredoxin oxidoreductase subunits were
identiﬁed in the C. symbiosum sequences (C01A08, C17D04,

Chemoautotrophy in MarineCrenarchaeota
C05B02, and C05G02), close examination of overlapping and
adjacent intervals found them to be syntenic, consistent with
common coverage of an equivalent genomic interval derived
from separate donors (Table S1, unpublished data). In
Clostridium thermoaceticum,pyruvate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase
has been shown to function in both oxidative decarboxylation
of pyruvate to CO
2 and acetyl-CoA, and the carboxylation of
acetyl-CoA to form pyruvate [51]. It is possible that C.
symbiosum, like C. thermoaceticum, encodes a multifunctional
enzyme complex mediating forward and reverse reactions in
one or more of the TCA-dependent steps. Functional studies
remain necessary, however, to determine the speciﬁcity of
this complex towards pyruvate, 2-isoketovalerate, or 2-
oxoglutarate.
In the case of the reductive TCA cycle, no homologues for
aclA, aclB, ccs,or ccl were identiﬁed in theC. symbiosum fosmid
sequences. However, three fosmids (C04F04, C05C02, and
C13G08) containing genes predicted to encode the beta
subunit of citrate lyase (citE), mediating the conversion of
citryl-CoA to acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate were identiﬁed
(Tables 2 and S1). In bacteria,citE exists as part of an operon
containing genes encoding citrate-CoA transferase(citF), and
an acyl carrier protein subunit(citD). Bacterial homologues of
citrate lyase play deﬁned roles in citrate fermentation path-
ways [52,53]. However, little is known about the functional
aspects of archaeal citrate lyases. A similar case toC. symbiosum
has been described in the facultative heterotrophic crenarch-
aeon, Thermoproteus tenax, where a single gene predicted to
encode the beta subunit of citrate lyase(citE) was identiﬁed in
the draft genome sequence [54]. No direct homologues forcitD
or citF were identiﬁed. However, the authors speculate that
two genes adjacent tocitE, predicted to encode acetyl-CoA
synthetase and acety-CoA transferase/carnitine dehydratase
have the potential to ﬁll in for the missing citrate-CoA
transferase and acyl carrier subunits, respectively [54]. At
present, ATP citrate lyase activity in T. tenax remains
unmeasured, although
13C-labeling studies in a close relative,
Thermoproteus neutrophilus, successfully measured incorpora-
tion patterns consistent with the operation of a reductive
TCA cycle in autotrophically grown cells [22,24]. Similar toT.
tenax, no direct homologues ofcitF or citD were identiﬁed in
the C. symbiosum fosmid sequences, although unlinked genes
predicted to encode acetyl-CoA synthetases were identiﬁed
on four separate fosmids (C01C01, C17E03, C07D05, and
C13E07). In contrast toT. tenax,no homologues for acety-CoA
transferase/carnitine dehydratase were identiﬁed.
Taken together, the data suggests thatC. symbiosum utilizes
either the oxidative TCA cycle in the consumption of organic
carbon and in the production of intermediates for amino
acid and cofactor biosynthesis, or a horseshoe version of the
TCA cycle charting an oxidative branch between citrate and
2-oxoglutarate and a reductive branch between oxaloacetate
and succinate for biosynthetic purposes alone.
A Potential Mode of Ammonia Oxidation inC. symbiosum
Chemolithoautotrophic ammonia oxidation produces en-
ergy and reducing equivalents used for cell growth, carbon
assimilation, and the generation of a proton motive force. In
bacteria such as Nitrosomonas europaea and Nitrosospira multi-
formis, ammonia monooxygenase composed of a, b, and c
membrane-bound subunits, encoded by the genesamoA, amoB,
and amoC, respectively, catalyzes the conversion of ammonia
(NH
3) to hydroxylamine (NH 2OH). In these, NH 2OH is
subsequently converted to nitrite through the activity of
hydroxylamine oxidoreductase, a phylogenetically unique
homotetramer containing eight heme groups [55]. Among
ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, up to three copies of theamo
operon may be present, with conserved gene order,amoCAB
[55]. Two fosmids (C07D08 and C18D02) containing genes
encoding putative a, b, and c subunits, co-located over an
approximately 6-Kb inter val were identiﬁed in the C.
symbiosum fosmid sequences (Tables 3 and S1 and Figures 2,
4, and S1). TheC. symbiosum amoA, amoB,and amoC genes were
predicted to encode proteins 26% identical and 40% similar,
25% identical and 44% similar, and 50% similar and 32%
identical to the correspondinga, b and c subunits from N.
multiformis, N. oceani, and N. europaea, respectively. A second
unlinked gene encoding ac subunit, 31% identical and 51%
similar to thec3 subunit fromN. europaea was also identiﬁed
in the C. symbiosum fosmid sequences (Tables 1 and S1 and
Figure 4B). Analysis of predicted transmembrane domains
afﬁliated withC. symbiosumammonia monooxygenase subunits
identiﬁed 6, 2, and 4 membrane spanning intervals in thea, b,
and c subunits respectively, compared with 6, 2, and 6
membrane spanning intervals for related subunits in N.
europaea (see Materials and Methods).
Bacterial ammonia monooxygenase subunits share close
structural and functional similarity with particulate methane
monooxygenase subunits [56,57]. Given this relationship, a
search was conducted for downstream effectors of aerobic
methane oxidation in theC. symbiosumsequence. Two steps in
the tetrahydrofolate-dependent (H4F) pathway of methane
oxidation encoded by a bifunctional 5,10-methylene-H4F
dehydrogenase/methenyl-H4F cyclohydrolase were identiﬁed
[58]. However, neither formyl-H4F synthase nor formate
dehydrogenase homologues could be found, suggesting a role
for the bifunctional enzyme in folate biosynthesis rather than
methane oxidation. Moreover, no gene identiﬁcations could
be made for components of the tetrahydromethanopterin-
dependent (H4MPT) pathway, including methylene-H4MPT
dehydrogenase, methenyl-H4MPT cyclohydrolase, formylme-
thanofuran-H4MPT dehydrogenase, or formylmethanofuran
dehydrogenase [58].
Although homologues for all three amo subunits were
identiﬁed in theC. symbiosum fosmid sequences, downstream
effectors of the canonical b acterial pathway including
hydroxylamine oxidoreductase and two cytochromes, c
554
and cm552, required for electron ﬂow to ubiquinone [55] were
not be identiﬁed. The identiﬁcation ofamo gene sequences
and the absence ofhao, c554, and cm552 homologues, suggests
that nonthermophilic Crenarchaeota may use alternative
mechanisms for channeling electrons derived from ammonia
oxidation into the electron transport system. Consistent with
this hypothesis, 34 genes predicted to contain blue type (I)
copper binding domains (similar to the plastocyanin/azurin
family) with the potential to substitute for cytochromes in
archaeal energy metabolism [59] were identiﬁed in the C.
symbiosum fosmid sequences (Table S1). Several of these genes
were found to exist in operons containing up to four closely
related copies (C01B01, C02G05, C05C02, and C08B04) or in
combination with genes encoding Rieske iron-sulfur cluster
proteins and subunits related to the cytochrome b6f complex
(C01C01, C03H05, C17E03, and C13A11) [60,61].

Chemoautotrophy in MarineCrenarchaeota
reduced nitrogen compounds were identiﬁed in the C.
symbiosum fosmid sequences (Tables 3 and S1). In the ﬁrst
case, ﬁve copies of a gene 47% identical and 62% similar to a
predicted ammonia permease (amt) from the anaerobic
propionate oxidizing bacterium Syntrophobacter fumaroxidans
were identiﬁed (Tables 3 and S1). In the second case, two
copies of a gene predicted to encode a urea transporter, 52%
identical and 70% similar to an ATP-dependent urea trans-
porter (dur3) from Oryza sativa,was identiﬁed (Tables 3 and S1
and Figure 2). Immediately adjacent to the predicteddur3
homologue, an operon encoding three core urease (ure)
subunits arranged in the order ureCBA was identiﬁed,
followed by a second operon encoding ﬁve additional urease
accessory genes arranged in the orderureDEFGH in opposite
orientation to thedur3/ureCBA operon (Tables 3 and S1). The
most conserved homologues from known organisms for all
seven of theure subunits were derived from bacterial groups
(Table 3). Several ammonia oxidizing bacteria, including
Nitrosospira sp. strain NpAV andN. oceani encode functional
urease operons with related subunit composition to the
urease observed in theC. symbiosum fosmid sequences [62]. In
Nitrosospira, urease provides a complementary source of
ammonia and carbon dioxide for chemolithoautotrophic
growth in low pH environments and a mechanism for
alkalization of the surrounding microenvironment [62,63].
In addition to components of a potential ammonia
oxidation pathway, four fosmids (C01A05, C02B01, C01D10,
and C15E09) containing genes predicted to encode multi-
copper oxidases related to nitrite reductase(nirK) (Tables 3
and S1 and Figures 2 and S2) and three fosmids (C07C04,
C20E06, and C08B03) containing genes predicted to encode
nitric oxide reductase subunits (norQ and norD) were
identiﬁed in the C. symbiosum fosmid sequences (Tables 3
and S1 and Figure 2). The predicted nitrite reductase was
54% identical and 67% similar to a copper-containing nitrite
reductase from the actinomyceteFrankia sp. CcI3, a nitrogen-
ﬁxing symbiont of nonleguminous plants (Tables 3 and S1).
The nitric oxide reductase homologue was found to exist in
an operon with a second gene predicted to contain a 136
amino acid interval 25% identical and 44% similar to the
nitric oxide reductase activation protein from Thiobacillus
denitriﬁcans, and a third gene 31% identical and 46% similar
to a conserved archaeal protein fromSulfolobus acidocaldarius
related to electron-transferring ﬂavoproteins. In addition to
the predicted nitrite reductase and nitric oxide reductase,
four fosmids (C06D08, C09D08, C12D02, and C13F02)
predicted to encode ferredoxi n sulﬁte/nitrite reductase
subunits, 40% identical and 57% similar to ferredoxin
sulﬁte/nitrite reductase beta subunits from Thermus thermo-
philus, were identiﬁed. In all instances, the two beta subunits
formed part of a larger gene cluster encoding a rhodanese-
related sulfurtransferase, thiazole biosynthesis protein, and
thioredoxin reductase, suggesting a role in assimilatory sulfur
metabolism.
As downstream components of a potential ammonia
oxidation pathway, copper containing nitrite reductase and
nitric oxide reductase could play a role in determining
tolerance to nitrite and nitric oxides, respectively, or under
limiting oxygen concentrations, allow for the use of nitrous
oxide as an alternative electron acceptor [64]. A similar set of
observations has been experimentally veriﬁed inN. europaea,
where a periplasmic copper-type nitrite reductase and a
nitric oxide reductase complex were found to protect cells
from the toxic effects of nitrite and nitric oxide, respectively
[65,66].
Taken together, the data are consistent with the hypothesis
that C. symbiosum is capable of utilizing reduced nitrogen
compounds, including urea and ammonia, to generate
cellular energy. Moreover, the identiﬁcation of genes in-
volved in the metabolism of nitrogen oxides provides a

validate these hypothetical pathways, and to determine the

deﬁned homologue for hydroxylamine oxidoreductase.
Carbon Assimilation and Ammonia Oxidation Pathway
Ggene Sequences in PlanktonicCrenarchaeota
Autotrophic carbon assimilation pathway genes.To iden-
tify planktonic crenarchaeal homologues of C. symbiosum
genes potentially involved in the 3-hydroxypropionate and
TCA cycles, searches were conducted with the set of
identiﬁed C. symbiosum open reading frames, queried against
GenBank and the SAR environmental database [26] (Tables 1,
2, S2, and S3). In the case of deﬁnedC. symbiosum TCA cycle
components, the top-scoring GenBank IDs were distributed
evenly among crenarchaeal (31%), euryarchaeal (31%), and
bacterial (38%) groups. In contrast, the overwhelming
majority (83%) of deﬁned 3-hydroxypropionate cycle com-
ponents identiﬁed in this study were distributed among
crenarchaeal (43%) and euryarchaeal (50%) groups. In two
instances, the top-scoring GenBank subjects came from
fosmid clones derived from uncultivated groups representing
planktonic Crenarchaeota (Tables 1 and 2). In all cases, the
highest-scoring BLAST identities for 3-hydroxypropionate
and TCA cycle components were identiﬁed in the environ-
mental database composed of gene sequences recovered from
the SAR (Tables 1 and 2), consistent with the presence of
genotypes representing planktonic Crenarchaeota across the
combined set of seven sequenced sample bins [26].
In members of theSulfolobales, genes encoding acetyl-CoA
carboxylase subunits are typically arranged in a single operon
in the orderaccCBA [20,21]. In C. symbiosum, genes encoding
acetyl-CoA carboxylase subunits were arranged in a single
operon with the orderaccACB. A contig assembled from WGS
sequence recovered from the SAR (AACY01042731) con-

tained an intact acc operon with subunit organization
identical to that ofC. symbiosum (Figure 3A). A biotin ligase
(birA) containing contig identiﬁed in the SAR dataset
(AACY01093101) exhibited a similarly close relationship to
the birA interval identiﬁed inC. symbiosum fosmid sequences
(Figure 3A, Table S2, and unpublished data).
Comparison of deduced amino acid sequences revealed
that subunits of theacc operon identiﬁed on AACY01042731
were more closely related to C. symbiosum than to other
archaeal groups (Figure 3B and unpublished data). Moreover,
predicted gene identity over the length of AACY01042731
closely matched that ofC. symbiosumin regions ﬂanking theacc
operon (Figure 3B). Using this contig as a starting point for
nucleotide BLAST surveys of the environmental database,
additional overlapping c ontigs (AACY01081100, AA-
CY01042730, AACY01042732, and AACY01027193) were
identiﬁed in the environmental database (Figure 3B and
Table S2). Conceptual translation of these sequence intervals
revealed a high degree of conservation between overlapping
regions more distal to theC. symbiosum accoperon, including a
large operon predicted to encode the complete set of NADH-
ubiquinone oxidoreductase subunits immediately down-
stream of the acc operon, and a second operon containing
succinate dehydrogenase subunits situated several kilobases
upstream (Figure 3B). Paired-end analysis of individual reads
from the SAR trace ﬁles conﬁrmed the order and orientation
of the set of contigs identiﬁed in the environmental database
based on homology to theC. symbiosum acc interval (unpub-
lished data). SAR contigs with the potential to encode the
complete set of 3-hydroxypropionate components identiﬁed
in the C. symbiosum fosmid sequences were identiﬁed in the
environmental database. In each instance at least one contig
greater than 3 Kb was identiﬁed sharing signiﬁcant con-
servation of gene content and order in regions adjacent to
the original query sequence (Table S2).

were conducted against GenBank and the environmental
database of SAR whole-genome shotgun sequences (Table 3).
Top scoring GenBank subjects for a and b subunits were
associated with an uncultured soil crenarchaeote (AJ627422)
[28]. Thec subunit was most similar to thec3 subunit fromN.
europaea (Table 3). In all cases, the highest scoring BLAST
identities for ammonia monooxygenase subunits were iden-
tiﬁed in the environmental database composed of gene
sequences recovered from the SAR (Tables 3 and S3).
Comparison of the genetic neighborhood surrounding the
amo gene cluster inC. symbiosumwith the terrestrial soil clone
(AJ627422) revealed little conservation of genes adjacent to
the amoA and amoB loci (Figure 4A). In contrast, a planktonic
crenarchaeal fosmid clone (AF393466) recovered from
Antarctic waters contained a block of nine predicted open
reading frames completely syntenic at the amino acid level to
a 6-Kb genomic interval upstream of theamoA gene identiﬁed
in C. symbiosum (Figure 4A) [33]. Similarly, three contigs
assembled from WGS sequence recovered from the SAR
(AACY01017302, AACY01007942, and AACY01075167) con-
tained homologous genes encoding a and c, and c and b
subunits, respectively (Figure 4B and Table S3). A fourth
contig (AACY01017301) containing theamoB gene was found
to contain several adjacent open reading frames predicted to
encode hypothetical proteins shared in common with theamo
gene cluster inC. symbiosum (Figure 4B). Despite a reduction
in the distance between genes encoding ammonia monoox-
ygenase subunits, SAR contigs shared additional gene content
with C. symbiosum in regions nested within and ﬂanking the
amo interval (Figure 4B). Predicted genes within these
intervals, although hypothetical, are conserved and therefore
of potential functional interest in the context of ammonia
oxidation. In addition to ammonia monooxygenase subunits,
47 sequences containing at least one copy of a gene predicted
to contain blue type (I) copper binding domains (related to
the plastocyanin/azurin family) were identiﬁed in the SAR
with homology toC. symbiosum (Table S3), and one copy was
identiﬁed on an environmental crenarchaeal fosmid recov-
ered from mesopelagic seawater (AY316120).
To further explore the potential link between energy
metabolism in C. symbiosum and planktonic Crenarchaeota,
degenerate amoA PCR primers based on the C. symbiosum
sequence were designed and used to screen bacterial artiﬁcial
chromosomes (BAC) and fosmid libraries of planktonic
microbes from the Central Paciﬁc, Monterey Bay, and the
Antarctic peninsula (see Materials and Methods) [33,67,68]. A
total of 26 amoA sequences were recovered from the
combined library set. Phylogenetic comparison of deduced
amino acid sequences for thea subunits revealed distant but
signiﬁcant similarities to homologous genes in bacteria
(Figure 5A, S1A). Genes encodinga subunits recovered from
environmental libraries were partitioned between distinct
shallow (0–130 m) and deep marine clades (500–4,000 m), with
C. symbiosum and SAR sequences falling within the shallow
marine clade (Figure 5A). Overall, a subset of environmental
sequences recovered from the water column at 130 m in the
Central Paciﬁc was most closely related to the predictedC.
symbiosum a subunit. Similar tree topologies were observed for
b and c subunits based on comparison of deduced amino acid
sequences for amoB and amoC genes identiﬁed in GenBank
and the SAR datasets (Figures 5B, 5C, S1B, and S1C).
The most conserved homologues forC. symbiosum–associ-
ated ammonia permease, urea transporter, and urease
subunits were all found in the environmental database of
gene sequences from the SAR (Table 3). A contig assembled
from WGS sequence recovered from the SAR (AA-
CY01052619) contained homologous genes encoding the urea
transporter, the core urease operon (ureABC), and two
additional accessory genes(ureEF). (Table S3 and unpublished
data). An overlapping contig (AACY01000023) containing the
remaining urease accessory genes(ureEFGH) was also identi-
ﬁed. The presence of ammonia permease, linked urea
transport, and catabolism genes inC. symbiosum, as well as in
sequences derived from the SAR, suggest the capacity for
generation and utilization of reduced nitrogen compounds
for either amino acid biosynthesis, energy production, or
both by planktonic Crenarchaeota. SAR contigs encoding the
complete set of ammonia monooxygenase components
identiﬁed in the C. symbiosum fosmid sequences were
identiﬁed in the environmental database. In each instance,
at least one contig greater than 2.5 Kb shared signiﬁcant
conservation of gene content and order in regions adjacent
to theC. symbiosum sequence (Table S3).
Sequence coverage and synteny betweenC. symbiosumgenes
and environmental databases. To explore the distribution
and coverage of crenarchaeal sequences in the SAR, contigs
containing acc, birA, amo, and ure genes homologous to C.
symbiosum were used to identify individual WGS reads from
each of seven separate SAR shotgun DNA libraries (see
Materials and Methods) [26]. The distribution of sequences
encoding crenarchaeal homologues for this gene set varied
considerably between samples, with SAR samples 2, 3, and 4
containing the majority of sequences, while SAR samples 5, 6,
and 7 contained none (Figure S3). Although it was twice as
twice as large as SAR samples 2, 3, and 4, and collected in the
same water on the same day as SAR sample 2, SAR sample 1
contained far fewer WGS reads encoding crenarchaeal
homologues foracc, birA, amo,and ure genes. This observation
is presumably the result of contamination in SAR sample 1
that masked the representation of endogenous genotypes.
Similar results for each sample bin were obtained in searches
for crenarchaeal SSU (Figure S3) and LSU (unpublished data)
sequences (see Materials and Methods). These observations
are consistent with sampling parameters, including the pore
size of preﬁltration and collection ﬁlters used (0.8–0.1lm for
SAR sample 1 and 7, 0.8–0.22lm for SAR samples 24, 20–3.0
lm for SAR sample 5, and 3–0.8lm for SAR sample 6), and
collection dates (2/25/2003 for SAR samples 3–4, 2/26/2003,
for SAR samples 1–2, and 5/15/2003 for SAR samples 5–7).
The late February collection dates for SAR samples 1–4 were
at a time of deep water mixing [26]. On average ﬁve
homologous genes were identiﬁed for acc, birA, amo, dur3,
and ure
genes in SAR samples 2–4, consistent with low to
moderate density representation of planktonic crenarchaeal
genotypes in these samples. Moreover, the absence of a
deﬁned crenarchaeal signal for SAR sample 7, targeting the
same size fraction as SAR samples 2–4, provides evidence for
a change in the surface abundance of planktonicCrenarch-
aeota in the SAR over the 3-mo interval between sample
collection. Sequence representation and paired-end infor-
mation, combined with the identiﬁcation and assembly of
extended genomic intervals, provides a starting point for
phylogenetic binning of presumptive planktonic crearchaeal
clones (Tables S2 and S3). A ﬁrst and essential step in

conducting comparative genomic studies using unassembled
environmental sequence data.
Discussion
Crenarchaeota although ubiquitous and abundant in the
marine environment have remained metabolically uncharac-
terized, in large part due to their resistance to cultivation. The
recent cultivation of a planktonic crenarchaeal isolate repre-
sents a breakthrough in this regard [29] and should provide an
invaluable biochemical system in which to test and extend the
hypotheses put forward in environmental genomic studies.
Over one decade ago cultivation-independent analyses of
environmental samples led to the discovery of planktonic
Crenarchaeota[1,3]. Application of these techniques continues to
provide important information on the nature, distribution, and
comparative genomics of marineCrenarchaeota. At present the
molecular mechanisms underlying observed patterns and
processes of autotrophic carbon assimilation and ammonia
oxidation in marine Crenarchaeota remain unresolved. The
identiﬁcation of candidate genes involved in these pathways is
an initial step in understanding the physiology and ecology of
marine Crenarchaeota and identifying targets and building
hypotheses for functional testing.
Multiple components of the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle of
autotrophic carbon assimilation were identiﬁed in the C.
symbiosum fosmids and in databases containing environmental
sequences representing uncultivated planktonicCrenarchaeota.
In every instance, the local genetic neighborhood surround-
ing the gene of interest was related between the various
marine crenarchaeal lineages. Several components of the
cycle could not be unequivocally determined on the basis of
homology, but could be tentatively identiﬁed by of domain
relatedness to corresponding pathway functions in the
bacterial domain. For instance, candidate genes with the
potential to encode components of malonyl-CoA reductase

gous regions to known genes encoding these activities inC.
aurantiacus. Several steps in the pathway, however, remain
unknown, including the mode of acetyl-CoA regeneration in
the absence of genes typically involved in glyoxylate
metabolism. Taken together, the data are consistent with
functional studies in more distantly related thermophilic
Crenarchaeota, including T. neutrophilus [22,23] and multiple
members of the Sulfolobales [17,18,20,21]. Based on this
previous work and the analyses reported here,C. symbiosum
and its planktonic relatives have the potential to employ a
modiﬁed version of the 3-hydroxypropionate cycle for
autotrophic carbon assimilation.
The pathway of crenarchaeal ammonia oxidation appears to
be different from well-deﬁned bacterial systems, given the
apparent absence of canonical downstream components
typically associated with electron ﬂow between hydroxylamine
and the ubiquinone pool. However, a good case for the process
of ammonia oxidation can be made given the primary and
secondary homology between marine crenarchaeal and bacte-
rial ammonia monooxygenase subunits. This role is further
supported by: the presence of genes encoding small copper
proteins with the potential to substitute for cytochromes in
mediating electron ﬂow [60,61], transport systems for reduced
nitrogen compounds incl uding ammonia and urea, the
presence of downstream genes encoding enzymes potentially
involved in nitrite and nitric oxide detoxiﬁcation, the absence
of downstream genes involved in aerobic methane oxidation,
and the physical and chemical oceanographic data linking
crenarchaeal abundance with byproducts of ammonia oxida-
tion [4,14–16,25]. The identiﬁcation of crenarchaeal amo
homologues in complex genomic libraries harboring unculti-
vated crenarchaeotes genomes and in a marine crenarchaeal
isolate cultivated on bicarbonate and ammonia as sole carbon
and energy sources [29], reinforces the hypothesis that‘‘free-
living’’ marine crenarchaeota employ an ammonia oxidation
pathway for energy generation.
Comparison of genomic features shared between C.
symbiosum and planktonic marineCrenarchaeota reveals several
emergent themes. Although dramatically divergent at the
nucleotide level (more than 15% difference in GþC content),
C. symbiosum shares striking homology with planktonic
Crenarchaeota in terms of gene identity, operon organization,
and content. This kinship appears to scale across oceanic
provinces based on the identiﬁcation of syntenic intervals
between an archaeal fosmid recovered from Antarctic waters,
assembled sequences from the Sargasso Sea, andC. symbiosum
genomic DNA itself. In every instance examined,C. symbiosum
gene products described in this study were most closely
related to homologues recovered from planktonicCrenarch-
aeota. This protein-based homology is suggestive, given the
divergent selective forces experienced by symbiotic and free-
living crenarchaeal lineages, of signiﬁcant shared metabolic
capacity. The variation in crenarchaeal ammonia monoox-
ygenase related subunits with water depth is also of ecological
interest, given the potential differences in dissolved oxygen
concentrations between surface and benthic waters or
between planktonic and symbiotic environments.
Environmental surveys have shown Crenarchaeota to be
dominant members of planktonic microbial communities [1–
3,69,70]. Radiocarbon and stable carbon isotope tracer
studies have implicated dissolved inorganic carbon as a
carbon source for planktonicCrenarchaeota [14–16]. We show
here that genetic information derived fromC. symbiosum can
be used in the reconstruction of plausible biochemical
mechanisms for autotrophic carbon assimilation, and a mode
of energy production required to sustain it. These mecha-
nisms likely converge on a facultative chemoautotrophic
metabolism, based on the eurybathyal distribution of
Crenarchaeota in the marine environment. The identiﬁcation
of gene sequences involved in 3-hydroxypropionate cycle,
TCA cycle, and ammonia oxidation pathways inC. symbiosum
provides a framework for inferring the genetic, biochemical,
and physiological properties of marine Crenarchaeota and a
database for designing molecular tools to test these hypoth-
eses directly in the world’s oceans.
Materials and Methods
Sample preparation and fosmid library construction.C. symbiosum
cell enrichment and DNA extraction from sponge tissue and fosmid
library construction have been previously described [32]. High
molecular weight DNA puriﬁed from A. mexicana cell enrichments
was used to construct two 32–45 Kb insert fosmid DNA libraries [31].
Brieﬂy, tissue from an individual Axinella mexicana sponge was
homogenized and enriched for prokaryotic cells by differential
centrifugation [31]. High-molecular-weight DNA from this cell
preparation was partially digested withSau3AI (Promega, Madison,
Wisconsin, United States) and treated with heat-labile phosphatase
(HK phosphatase; Epicentre, Madison, Wisconsin, United States). The
partially digested genomic DNA was ligated into pFOS [71] digested
previously with AatII, phosphatase treated (HK phosphatase), and
subsequently digested withBamHI. Ligated DNA was packaged using
the Gigapack XL packaging system (Stratagene, La Jolla, California,
United States) selecting for DNA inserts of 35 to 45 kilobase-pairs,
and used to transfect E. coli DH10B cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
California, United States ). Transfected cells were selected on LB agar
containing 15 lg/ml chloramphenicol (LB
cm15). Resulting fosmid
clones were picked into 96-well microtiter dishes containing LBcm15
with 7% glycerol and stored at/C0 80 8C.
Shotgun sequencing library preparation from fosmid clones.
Approximately 3–5lg of selected fosmid DNA was randomly sheared
to 3–4 kb fragments (25 cycles at speed code 12) in 100-lL volume
using a HydroShear (GeneMachines, San Carlos, California, United
States). The sheared DNA was immediately blunt end–repaired at
room temperature for 40 min using 6 U of T4 DNA Polymerase
(Roche, Mountain View, California, United States), 30 U of DNA
Polymerase I Klenow Fragment (New England Biolabs, Beverly,
Massachusetts, United States), 10lL of 10 mM dNTP mix (Amersham
Biosciences, Piscataway, New Jersey, United States), and 13lLo f1 03
Klenow Buffer in 130-lL total volume. After incubation the reaction
was heat inactivated for 15 min at 70
8C, cooled to 48C for 10 min,
and then frozen at/C0 20 8C for storage. The end-repaired DNA was run
on a 1% TAE agarose gel for; 30–40 min at 120 v. Using ethidium
bromide stain and UV illumination, 3–4-kb fragments were extracted
from the agarose gel and puriﬁed using QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, California, United States). Approximately 200–400
ng of puriﬁed fragment was blunt-end ligated for 40 min into the Sma
I site of 100 ng of pUC 18 cloning vector (Roche) using the Fast-Link
DNA Ligation Kit (Epicentre). Following standard protocols, 1lLo f
ligation product was electroporated into DH10B Electromax cells
(Invitrogen) using the GENE PULSER II electroporator (Bio-Rad,
Hercules, California, United States). Transformed cells were trans-
ferred into 1000lL of SOC and incubated at 37
8C in a rotating wheel
for 1 h. Cells (usually 20–50lL) were spread on LB agar plates 22322
cm containing 100lg/mL of ampicillin, 120lg/mL of IPTG, and 50
lg/mL of X-GAL. Colonies were grown for 16 h at 378C. Individual
white recombinant colonies were selected and picked into 384-well
microtiter plates containing LB/glycerol (7.5%) media containing 50
lg/mL of ampicillin using the Q-Bot multitasking robot (Genetix,
Dorset, United Kingdom). To test the quality of the library, 24
colonies were directly PCR ampliﬁed with pUC M13/C0 28 and /C0 40
primers using standard protocols. Libraries are considered to pass
PCR QC if they have.90% 3-kb inserts (for more information go to
http://www.jgi.doe.gov/sequencing/protocols/index.html).

grown in LB/glycerol (7.5%) media containing 50lg/mL of ampicillin
were added to 8lL of a 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.2)þ 0.1 mM EDTA
denaturation buffer. The mixtures were heat lysed at 958C for 5 min,
then placed at 48C for 5 min. To these denatured products, 10lLo f
an RCA reaction mixture (Templiphi DNA Sequencing Template
Ampliﬁcation Kit, Amersham Biosciences) were added. The ampliﬁ-
cation reactions were carried out at 308C for 12–18 h. The ampliﬁed
products were heat inactivated at 658C for 10 min, then placed at 48C
until used as template for sequencing.
Sequencing and assembly.Aliquots of the 20-lL ampliﬁed plasmid
RCA products were sequenced with standard M13 /C0 28 or /C0 40
primers. The reactions contained 1 lL RCA product, 4 pmoles
primer, 5 lLd H2O, and 4lL DYEnamic ET terminator sequencing
kit (Amersham Biosciences). Cycle-sequencing conditions were 30
rounds of 958C–25 sec, 508C–10 sec, 608C–2 min, hold at 48C. The
reactions were then puriﬁed by a magnetic bead protocol (see
research protocols at http://www.jgi.doe.gov) and run on a MegaBACE
4000 (Amersham Biosciences). Alternatively, 1lL of the RCA product
was sequenced with 2 pmoles of standard M13/C0 28 or/C0 40 primers, 1
lL5 3 buffer, 0.8 lLH 2O, and 1lL BigDye sequencing kit (Applied
Biosystems, Foster City, Calﬁornia, United States) at 1 min denatura-
tion and 25 cycles of 958C–30 sec, 50 8C–20 sec, 60 8C–4 min, and
ﬁnally held at 48C. The reactions were then puriﬁed by a magnetic
bead protocol (see research protocols at http://www.jgi.doe.gov/
sequencing/protocols/index.html) and run on an ABI PRISM 3730
(Applied Biosystems) capillary DNA sequencer. Assembly of raw trace
ﬁles was accomplished with PHRED/PRAP (http://www.phrap.org/
phredphrapconsed.html) software [72,73].
Environmental library screening for amoA genes. Environmental
DNA libraries derived from a variety of marine sources including the
Central Paciﬁc, Monterey Bay [67,74], and Antarctic waters [67,74]
were screened by PCR with the following degenerate primer pair
designed to detect crenarchaeal amoA gene sequences (crenAMO_F
59 ATGGTCTGGCTAAGACGMTGTA 3 9 and crenAMO_R 5 9
CCCACTTTGACCAAGCGGCCAT 39). 50-ll ampliﬁcation reaction
mixtures contained 1ll template DNA, 41.5ll1 3buffer, 1ll each 10
lM forward and reverse primer, 2.5 units TaqPlus Precision
polymerase (Stratagene), 5ll 10mM stock dNTP mixture. Ampliﬁca-
tions were carried out using the following proﬁle: 948C/2 min,330
cycles 948C/15 sec, 558C/30 sec, and 728C/30 sec, followed by a ﬁnal
extension at 72 8C/10 min. amoA amplicons were visualized on 1%
agarose gels in 13TBE and puriﬁed directly using Ultrafree-DA DNA
extraction ﬁlters (Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, United States),
followed by ethanol precipitation and resuspension in 5ll of sterile
ﬁltered water. Puriﬁed products were sequenced bidirectionally with
amoA_F and amoA_R primers on an ABI Prism 3100 DNA
sequencer (Applied Biosystems) using Big Dye chemistry (PE
Biosystems, Foster, California, United States) according to manufac-
turer’s instructions. Sequences were edited manually from traces
using Sequencher software V4.1.2 (Gene Codes, Ann Arbor, Michigan,
United States). Analyses of predicted transmembrane spanning
regions of deduced amino acid sequences for selectedamo sequences
were performed directly online with the TMHMM server v2.0 (http://
www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TMHMM/) using default settings.
DNA sequence analysis.Fosmid sequences were annotated using the
FGENESB pipeline for automatic annotation of bacterialgenomes
from Softberry (http://www.softberry.com/berry.phtml) using the fol-
lowing parameters and cutoffs: open reading frame size¼ 100 aa,
Expectation ¼ 13 10/C0 10. Predicted open reading frames were queried
against COG and GenBank nonredundant (NR) databases. SSU and
LSU rRNA genes were identiﬁed by blastn query against NR with
expectation cutoffs of 1 3 10/C0 8. tRNAs were identiﬁed using the
program tRNAscan-SE 1.21 (http://w ww.genetics.wustl.edu/eddy/
tRNAscan-SE) set to the archaeal tRNA covariance model [75].
Automated FGENESB annotation of fosmids was manually reﬁned
and corrected using the genome annotation and visualization tool
Artemis (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Artemis) [76]. Identiﬁcation
of CO2 ﬁxation and ammonia oxidation genes was based on the
combined results of FGENESB output, manual annotation, and
targeted tblastn queries against both GenBank, the environmental
database (env_nt), and the set of seven sample bins containing
individual WGS reads for the SAR. Putative crenarchaeal sequences
identiﬁed in the set of SAR contigs assembled in env_nt on the basis of
homology to speciﬁc open reading frames predicted in theC. symbiosum
dataset were used to reciprocally identify individual WGS reads from
the set of reads within each sample bin. A tblastn cutoff of 1310/C0 40 and
percent identity.75% for protein coding genes and a blastn cutoff of 1
310/C0 90 and percent identity.98% for SSU rRNA genes were used.
Phylogenetic analysis. Comparative analysis was performed on
amoA, amoB, and amoC sequences identiﬁed in this study and related
sequences available in GenBank and the environmental database. In
the case of amoA, sequences recovered by environmental library
screening were compared to sequences identiﬁed in GenBank, the
SAR, and the genome ofC. symbiosum. In the case ofamoB and amoC, only
sequences identiﬁed in GenBank, the SAR, and the genome ofC.
symbiosum were compared. Deduced amino acid sequences for environ-
mental amoA sequences were determined from 650 bp of overlapping
nucleotide sequence. Protein alignments for all subunits were
generated using the Clustal method. Phylogenetic trees fora, b, andc
subunits encoded byamoA, amoB,and amoC, respectively, were based on
comparison of 191, 199, and 148 parsimony informative characters,
respectively. Trees for all three subunits were generated using distance
and parsimony methods implemented in PAUP* version 4.0b10 [77]
and rooted with the corresponding subunit for particulate methane
monooxygenase. Bootstrapping for distance and parsimony was
accomplished with 1,000 replicates per tree using heuristic search
methods. Maximum-likelihood tree reconstructions were performed
with Tree-Puzzle v5.2 (http://www.tree-puzzle.de) using a quartet
puzzling procedure and 10,000 puzzling steps combined with a
Mueller-Vingron model of substitution and a gamma-type distribution
of rate heterogeneity with 16 categories. Bootstrap information was not
included for a particular node if polytomy was observed using two or
more tree reconstruction methods or if none of the bootstrap methods
yielded a value of 70% or greater. Bootstrapping for maximum-
likelihood was accomplished with 10,000 replicates.
