abstract
4-Oxalocrotonate tautomerase (4-OT) catalyzes the enol-keto tautomerization of 2-hydroxymuco-
nate, utilizing its N-terminal proline (Pro-1) as general base catalyst. Substituting Pro-1 with bulky
or charged residues will result in poor or no post-translational removal of the translation-initiating
methionine by the methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP) of theEscherichia coliexpression host. Here,
we set out to investigate whether co-expression with previously engineered aminopeptidase MetAP-
⁄TG can be used to produce the P1S, P1H and P1Q variants of 4-OT in a demethionylated form. The
P1S variant, which carries a small residue at the penultimate position (the ﬁrst position after the ini-
tiating methionine), was found to be fully processed by wild-type MetAP. The P1S variant has low-
level 2-hydroxymuconate tautomerase and promiscuous oxaloacetate decarboxylase activity. The
P1Q and P1H variants of 4-OT, which carry bulky residues at the penultimate position, could only
be obtained in a demethionylated form (a minor fraction of the puriﬁed protein is still composed
of methionylated enzyme) by co-expression with MetAP-⁄TG. Interestingly, the Gln-1 residue of
the demethionylated P1Q variant undergoes intramolecular cyclization to form pyroglutamate
(pE), yielding variant P1pE. Whereas the P1H/M1P2H mixture has low-level tautomerase activity,
the P1pE/M1P2Q mixture has robust tautomerase activity. The substitution of Pro-1 by Gln, followed
by removal of the initiating Met and cyclization of Gln-1 to form pE, is a unique way to obtain a
structural analogue of proline on the N-terminus of 4-OT. This opens up new possibilities to study
the importance of Pro-1 in recently discovered C–C bond-forming activities of this highly promiscu-
ous tautomerase.

1. Introduction
The enzyme 4-oxalocrotonate tautomerase (EC 5.3.2.6; 4-OT)
from the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida mt-2 catalyzes the
enol-keto tautomerization of 2-hydroxyhexa-2,4-dienedioate to
yield 2-oxohex-3-enedioate (Fig. 1) as part of a degradative path-
way for aromatic hydrocarbons [1–3]. 4-OT is a member of the
tautomerase superfamily, a group of homologous proteins charac-
terized by a structuralb-a-b-fold and a catalytic amino-terminal
proline residue (Pro-1) [4–6]. Pro-1 was found to be crucial for
both the natural and various promiscuous activities of the enzyme,
which include the hydrolytic dehalogenation oftrans-3-chloroac-
rylic acid[7–9], the aldol condensation of acetaldehyde with benz-
aldehyde [10,11], the Michael-type addition of linear aliphatic
aldehydes to a variety of aliphatic and aromatic nitrooleﬁns
[12–14], and thecis–trans isomerization of nitrostyrene[15]. The
chemical versatility of the amino-terminal proline is the core of
the catalytic diversity displayed by 4-OT; Pro-1 has been proposed
to act as a general base (tautomerase activity), a general acid
(dehalogenase activity), or as a nucleophile (aldol condensation,
cis–trans isomerization, and Michael-type additions)[7–16].
In order to gain insight into the structural and mechanistic roles
of Pro-1 in the native tautomerase activity of 4-OT, Whitman and
coworkers have studied mutants in which Pro-1 has been replaced
by an alanine, glycine, leucine or valine[17]. From this work it was
concluded that the stronger basicity of the secondary amine func-
tionality of proline compared to the primary amine functionality of
the introduced residue, and the rigidity of the pyrrolidine-ring, are
key determinants for the catalytic efﬁciency of the enzyme
towards its native substrate. During this study, mass spectral
analysis of the P1L and P1V variants revealed that the transla-
tion-initiating methionine was either not or incompletely removed
by the expression hostEscherichia coli. As a result, the P1L variant

was obtained as the M1P2L protein showing that no demethiony-
lation had occurred. The P1V variant was obtained as a mixture of
P1V and M1P2V proteins, of which 55% was constituted by
demethionylated protein. It was found that the presence of the ini-
tiating methionine had a pronounced effect on thekcat of these
variants towards the native tautomerase activity of 4-OT [17].
Overall thekcat dropped by more than three orders of magnitude,
which is likely caused by the structural effects the methionine
imposes on the active site resulting in unfavorable positioning of
the amino-terminus to act as a general base. These ﬁndings clearly
show that the removal of the initiating methionine is a prerequisite
in the study of Pro-1 variants of 4-OT.
One way of obtaining Pro-1 variants of 4-OT in a pure and fully
demethionylated form is by peptide synthesis[18]. Drawbacks of
this method are the high costs involved and the fact that the syn-
thetic protein needs to be reconstituted in buffer in a properly
folded and active form. While this is an experimental challenge,
it has been demonstrated to work for 4-OT[10,11,18]. Dawson
and coworkers chemically synthesized the P1G and P1A variants
of 4-OT, thereby introducing a primary amine functionality at the
amino-terminus of the enzyme replacing the secondary amine
functionality of Pro-1 [18]. Interestingly, both the P1G and P1A
variants were found to promiscuously catalyze the decarboxyl-
ation of oxaloacetate through a covalent imine-mechanism, yield-
ing pyruvate and carbon dioxide as the products (Fig. 2).
In order to develop an alternative manner of producing demeth-
ionylated Pro-1 variants of 4-OT and to avoid possible problems
with respect to reconstitution, we explored the possibility to
demethionylate new Pro-1 variants of 4-OT by biological means.
The enzyme inE. coli responsible for the removal of the initiating
methionine from newly synthesized proteins is methionine amino-
peptidase (MetAP)[19]. A key determinant in the substrate speci-
ﬁcity of MetAP is the nature of the penultimate residue (i.e., the
residue following the initiating methionine) of the substrate pro-
tein [20,21]. MetAP only accepts polypeptides with an amino-ter-
minal methionine as substrate when the side chain of the
penultimate residue is small (e.g., Gly, Ala or Pro). As a result, about
40% of the endogenous cytosolic proteins ofE. coliare not demeth-
ionylated and likewise the size of the side chain of the penultimate
residue of recombinant proteins produced byE. coliwill determine
whether demethionylation occurs or not[19]. As demethionylation
for recombinant proteins is often required, Liao and coworkers
have engineered MetAP towards a larger substrate scope by
increasing the size of the substrate binding pocket of the enzyme
[22]. This work has resulted in an engineered MetAP (termed
MetAP-⁄TG) that is capable of removing the initiating methionine
from recombinant proteins with bulkier or charged penultimate
residues.
Inspired by the work of Liao and coworkers, we set out to inves-
tigate whether the engineered variant MetAP-⁄TG can be used to
demethionylate Pro-1 variants of 4-OT that could not be studied
in the past due to the reason described above. We have chosen
to construct the 4-OT variants P1S, P1H and P1Q. The serine substi-
tution was selected because of the relatively small side chain of
serine, which may allow demethionylation of the P1S protein by
wild-type MetAP [22]. In addition, the mutation to serine may
introduce a new functional group at the amino-terminus of 4-OT.
The variants P1H and P1Q were selected because wild-type MetAP
does not accept peptide substrates with a histidine or glutamine at
the penultimate position[22]. Additionally, the side chains of these
residues offer interesting features. The imidazole functionality of
the side chain of histidine could act as a catalytic base, possibly
mimicking the role of Pro-1 of wild-type 4-OT. Following demeth-
ionylation of the P1Q variant, the amino-terminal glutamine could
undergo an intramolecular cyclization reaction (deamination)
yielding pyroglutamate (pE), which is an interesting proline ana-
logue (5-oxoproline,Fig. 3) [23]. The formation of amino-terminal
pyroglutamate, either from a glutamine or glutamate residue, is a
known post-translational modiﬁcation that is important for the
stability or activity of a variety of proteins, e.g., in human
immunoglobulin gamma antibodies [24,25]. Proteins harboring
an amino-terminal pyroglutamate are less susceptible to proteo-
lytic degradation [23,26]. Examples where an amino-terminal
pyroglutamate is essential for catalysis in enzymes are rare, a nota-
ble example being a family of amphibian ribonucleases[27,28].I n
bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) ribonuclease 3, an amino-terminal
pyroglutamate assists in catalysis by perturbing the pK
a of two cat-
alytic histidine residues[27,28]. Given that the amide-nitrogen of
the c-lactam ring of pyroglutamate is not likely to be able to
function as a general base catalyst, it would be interesting to inves-
tigate whether a P1pE variant of 4-OT is catalytically active.
Herein, we describe the expression, puriﬁcation and character-
ization of the P1S, P1H and P1pE variants of 4-OT. The puriﬁed

proteins were subjected to ESI-MS analysis to establish their level
of demethionylation and characterized for their 2-hydroxymuco-
nate tautomerase activities. Additionally, the P1S variant was sub-
jected to labeling studies with oxaloacetate and characterized
towards its oxaloacetate decarboxylase activity, parallel to the
work of Dawson and coworkers on the P1A and P1G variants of
4-OT (Fig. 2).
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
The sources of the chemicals, biochemicals, components of buf-
fers and media, PCR puriﬁcation, gel extraction and miniprep kits,
DEAE- and phenylsepharose, pre-packed PD-10 Sephadex G-25 col-
umns, and the oligonucleotides, enzymes and reagents used in the
molecular biology procedures are reported elsewhere[29,30]. All
chemicals were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich Chemical Co. (St.
Louis, MO) unless stated otherwise. 2-Hydroxymuconate was a
kind gift of Professor C.P. Whitman (University of Texas at Austin,
TX). The plasmid pET-29(MetAP-⁄TG) harboring the gene coding
for the engineeredE. coli methionine aminopeptidase was kindly
supplied by Dr. Y.-D. Liao (Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Acade-
mia Sinica, Taipei, Taiwan).
2.2. General methods
Techniques for restriction enzyme digestions, ligation, transfor-
mation, and other standard molecular biology manipulations were
based on methods described elsewhere[31] or as suggested by the
manufacturer. The PCR was carried out in a DNA thermal cycler
(model GS-1) obtained from Biolegio (Nijmegen, The Netherlands).
DNA sequencing was performed by ServiceXS (Leiden, The Nether-
lands) or Macrogen (Seoul, Korea). Protein was analyzed by sodium
dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE) on
gels containing 10% polyacrylamide. The gels were stained with
Coomassie brilliant blue. Protein concentrations were determined
by the method of Waddell[32]. Kinetic data were obtained on a
V-650 or V-660 spectrophotometer from Jasco (IJsselstein, The
Netherlands). The kinetic data were ﬁtted by nonlinear regression
data analysis using the Graﬁt program (Erithacus, Software Ltd.,
Horley, U.K.) obtained from Sigma Chemical Co. ESI-MS and
MS/MS spectra were recorded using an LCQ electrospray mass
spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA).
2.3. Construction of pET20b(+)-based expression vectors for the
production of 4-OT P1S, 4-OT-P1Q, and 4-OT P1H
The mutant genes of 4-OT were generated by PCR using plasmid
pET-3b(4-OT) as the template[8]. The forward primers, which con-
tain a NdeI restriction site (underlined) and the desired mutation
(in bold) followed by 22 bases corresponding to the coding
sequence of the 4-OT gene, were as follows: 50-A TAG CAG GT C
CAT ATG TCG ATT GCC CAG ATC CAC ATC CTT G-30 (P1S-F), 50-A
TAG CAG GTC CAT ATGCAG ATT GCC CAG ATC CAC ATC CTT G-30
(P1Q-F) and 50-A TAG CAG GTC CAT ATGCAT ATT GCC CAG ATC
CAC ATC CTT G-30 (P1H-F). In all cases, the following reverse primer
was used: 50-G TGA TGT TAT GGA TCCTCA GCG TCT GAC CTT GCT-
30 (BamHI restriction site underlined). The ampliﬁcation mixture
was made up in Phusion High-Fidelity buffer and contained
250 lM of each dNTP, 150 ng of each primer, 50 ng of pET-3b(4-
OT), and 1 U of Phusion DNA polymerase. The cycling parameters
were 95 /C176C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles of 98/C176C for 30 s,
45 /C176C for 30 s and 72/C176C for 20 s, with a ﬁnal elongation step of
72 /C176C for 10 min. The resulting PCR product and the pET-20b(+)
vector (Novagen) were digested withNdeI and BamHI restriction
enzymes, after which the vector was dephosphorylated with alka-
line phosphatase. Following puriﬁcation, the PCR product and vec-
tor were ligated using T4 DNA ligase. An aliquot of the ligation
mixture was transformed into competent E. coli DH10B cells.
Transformants were selected at 37/C176C on LB/ampicillin plates. Plas-
mid DNA was isolated from several colonies and analyzed by
restriction analysis for the presence of the insert. The cloned gene
was sequenced to verify that no mutations had been introduced
during the ampliﬁcation of the gene. The newly constructed
expression vectors were named pET-20b(4-OT/P1S), pET-20b(4-
OT/P1Q) and pET-20b(4-OT/P1H).
2.4. Construction of the pET-26b(4-OT/P1Q), pET-26b(4-OT/P1H) and
pET-20b(MetAP⁄TG) expression vectors
In order to obtain the genes coding for the 4-OT P1Q and 4-OT
P1H variants for the recloning procedure, sufﬁcient amounts of the
plasmids pET-20b(4-OT/P1Q) and pET-20b(4-OT/P1H) were
digested with NdeI and BamHI restriction enzymes (in separate
experiments), and the mutant genes of 4-OT were subsequently
puriﬁed from 1% agarose gels. The pET-26b vector was digested
with NdeI andBamHI restriction enzymes, dephosphorylated with
alkaline phosphatase, and puriﬁed. The 4-OT P1Q and 4-OT P1H
genes and the vector were ligated using T4 DNA ligase. The pET-
20b(MetAP⁄TG) expression vector was constructed using the same
procedure with the following modiﬁcation. The MetAP-⁄TG gene
used for the recloning procedure was obtained by digesting a suf-
ﬁcient amount of the pET-29(MetAP⁄TG) plasmid with SacI and
HindIII restriction enzymes, followed by gel-based puriﬁcation.
The pET-20b(+) vector was digested withSacI and HindIII restric-
tion enzymes, dephosphorylated with alkaline phosphatase, and
puriﬁed. The MetAP-⁄TG gene and the vector were ligated using
T4 DNA ligase. Of each ligation mixture an aliquot was transformed
into competentE. coliDH10B cells. Transformants were selected at
37 /C176C on LB/ampicillin plates. Plasmid DNA was isolated from sev-
eral colonies and analyzed by restriction analysis for the presence
of the insert. The cloned gene was sequenced to verify that no
mutations had been introduced during the recloning procedure.
2.5. Expression and puriﬁcation of mutant 4-OT proteins
The mutant 4-OT proteins and MetAP-⁄TG were co-produced in
E. coliBL21(DE3) using the T7 expression system. The 4-OT P1S and
4-OT P1H mutants were expressed as follows. Fresh BL21(DE3)
transformants containing the appropriate expression plasmid (or
plasmids) were collected from an LB agar plate and used to inocu-
late LB medium (10 mL). After growth for 3–6 h at 37/C176C, this cul-
ture was used to inoculate fresh LB medium (1 L) to a starting
OD600 of about 0.01. LB agar plates and LB medium were supple-
mented with ampicillin (100 lg/mL), or with ampicillin (100
lg/mL) in combination with kanamycin (30 lg/mL) and IPTG
(100 lM) when the 4-OT variants were co-produced with MetAP-
⁄TG. After overnight growth at 37/C176C, with vigorous shaking, cells
were harvested by centrifugation (10 min at 2300g) and resus-
pended in 10 mM NaH2PO4 buffer, pH 7.3, to a total volume of
about 10 mL.
The 4-OT P1Q variant was expressed using the same protocol
with the following modiﬁcation. When expressed using the vector

amino-terminal glutamine.

pET-20(4-OT P1Q), the host organism was grown in LB medium as
described above, yielding non-demethionylated 4-OT P1Q (M1P
2Q). When using the pET-26(4-OT P1Q) vector, auto-induction
(ZYM) medium (10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract, 25 mM Na2-
HPO4,2 5 m MK H2PO4, 5 mM Na2SO4, pH 6.7) was used, supple-
mented with 0.5% (v/v) glycerol, 0.05% (w/v) glucose, MgSO 4
(2 mM), kanamycin (30lg/mL), and 0.2% (w/v) lactose. When
co-produced with MetAP-⁄TG using the vector pET-20b(MetAP-
⁄TG), the medium was further supplemented with ampicillin
(100 lg/mL). Co-production with MetAP-⁄TG resulted in the pro-
duction of the 4-OT P1Q variant as a mixture of P1pE/P1Q/
M1P2Q or P1pE/M1P2Q proteins.
The puriﬁcation of the mutant 4-OT proteins is identical to that
of wild-type 4-OT, which has been reported elsewhere[10,11].
Puriﬁed proteins were concentrated to /C2410 mg/mL in 10 mM
NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.3), frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at
/C080 /C176C until further use.
2.6. Enzyme assays
The tautomerization activity of wild-type 4-OT and the mutant
4-OT proteins were measured by monitoring the ketonization of 2-
hydroxymuconate to 2-oxohex-3-enedioate in 10 mM NaH2PO4
buffer (pH 7.3) at 22/C176C. Stock solutions of 2-hydroxymuconate
were generated by dissolving the appropriate amount of 2-hydrox-
ymuconate in absolute ethanol. The assay buffer was prepared by
diluting the appropriate amount of enzyme (from a/C2410 mg/mL
stock solution) in 50 mL of 10 mM NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.3). The
enzyme was allowed to equilibrate for one hour at 22/C176C. The keto-
nization of 2-hydroxymuconate to 2-oxohex-3-enedioate was
monitored by following the increase in absorbance at 236 nm
(e = 6.58/C2103 M/C01 cm/C01) [2]. The assay was initiated by the addi-
tion of a small aliquot of substrate (2–15lL) to 1 mL of the assay
buffer in a quartz cuvette. At all substrate concentrations, the non-
enzymatic rate was subtracted from the enzymatic rate of
ketonization.
The oxaloacetate decarboxylase activity of the 4-OT P1S and
4-OT P1A variants was measured by following the depletion of
the enol-form of oxaloacetate (oxobutanedioic acid) in 50 mM
NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.3) at 22/C176C [18]. A stock solution (1 M) of
oxaloacetate was made by dissolving the crystalline free acid in
absolute ethanol directly before use. The assay buffer was prepared
by diluting the appropriate amount of enzyme (from a/C2410 mg/mL
stock solution) in 30 mL of 50 mM NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.3) and
allowed to equilibrate for 1 h at 22/C176C. The assay was initiated by
adding a small aliquot of substrate (2–15lL) to 1 mL of the assay
buffer in a quartz cuvette. The decarboxylation of the keto-form
of oxaloacetate was monitored by following the decrease of absor-
bance of the enol-form at 295 nm (
e = 3.0/C2102 M/C01 cm/C01). Upon
addition of the substrate to the assay buffer and the establishment
of the enol-keto equilibrium, the rate of decarboxylation of the
keto-form may be assumed to be equal to the rate of depletion
(i.e., ketonization) of the enol-form, as the keto-form of the sub-
strate exists in rapid equilibrium with the enol-form under the
assay conditions. At all substrate concentrations, the nonenzymatic
rate was subtracted from the enzymatic rate of decarboxylation.
2.7. Mass spectral analysis of mutant 4-OT proteins and peptide
mapping
The protein samples for ESI-MS analysis were made up as fol-
lows. A protein sample stored in 10 mM NaH2PO4 buffer (pH 7.3)
was exchanged against 5 mM NH4HCO2 buffer (pH 7.3) using a
pre-packed PD-10 Sephadex G-25 gelﬁltration column. The protein
was concentrated to a concentration of 0.5–1 mg/mL using a Viva-
spin centrifugal concentrator equipped with a 5000 Da molecular
weight cut-off ﬁltration membrane (Sartorius Stedim Biotech
S.A., France). An appropriate amount of protein was subsequently
diluted to a ﬁnal concentration of 25lM in a sample volume of
100 lL. Samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at
/C020 /C176C prior to ESI-MS analysis.
For peptide mapping studies, samples were prepared as
described elsewhere[10]. LC–MS/MS analysis and data processing
were performed as follows. The obtained peptide fractions were
introduced into an LC–MS/MS system using an Ultimate 3000 nano
(Dionex, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) in-line connected to an LTQ
Orbitrap XL (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Bremen, Germany). The sam-
ple mixture was subsequently loaded on a trapping column
(Acclaim PepMap C18, 5 mm length/C2300 lm I.D., 5lm particle
size, 100 Å porosity, Dionex, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Inc.). After
back-ﬂushing from the trapping column, the sample was loaded
on a reverse-phase column (Acclaim PepMap C18, 15 cm
length /C275
lm I.D. /C23 lm particle size, 100 Å porosity, Dionex,
Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc Inc.). Peptides were loaded in 0.1% formic
acid, and were separated with a linear gradient from 1% solvent A
(0.1% formic acid) to 90% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile)
at a ﬂow rate of 250 nL/min. The mass spectrometer was operated
in data dependent mode, automatically switching between MS and
MS/MS acquisition for the ﬁve most abundant doubly and triply
charged ions with a minimal signal of 2500 in a given MS spec-
trum. Full scan MS spectra were acquired in the Orbitrap at a target
value of 1.0 /C2106 with a resolution of 60,000. The ﬁve most
intense ions which meet the set criteria were then isolated for frag-
mentation in the linear ion trap, with a dynamic exclusion of 10 s.
Peptides were fragmented after ﬁlling the ion trap at a target value
of 1.0/C2104 ion counts. Data was analyzed using Peak6 software
(Bioinformatics Solutions Inc., Waterloo, ON, Canada).
2.8. Irreversible alkylation of 4-OT and 4-OT P1Q with
3-bromopyruvate
The irreversible alkylation of wild-type 4-OT and 4-OT variants
with 3BP and subsequent sample preparation for ESI-MS analysis
was performed as described elsewhere[29].
2.9. Reductive amination of 4-OT P1S and 4-OT P1A
Imine formation of 4-OT mutants with oxaloacetate or pyruvate
was determined as follows. Stock solutions of oxaloacetate
(100 mM) and pyruvate (200 mM) were made up in 10 mM
NaH2PO4 buffer (pH adjusted to 7.3). The enzyme (1 mg, 147lM)
was incubated for 5 min at 22/C176C in the presence of oxaloacetate
(10 mM) or pyruvate (10 mM) in 1 mL of 10 mM NaH2PO4 buffer
(pH 7.3). The reaction mixture was subsequently made 4 mM in
NaCNBH
3 (from a 1 M stock solution in H2O) and incubated for
10 min at 22/C176C, thus irreversibly trapping iminium ions by reduc-
tion to their respective amines. The reaction mixture was then
exchanged to 5 mM NH4HCO2 buffer (pH 7.3) for ESI-MS analysis
of the modiﬁed proteins, as described above.
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Puriﬁcation and characterization of 4-OT variants co-expressed
with MetAP-⁄TG
The genes encoding the 4-OT variants (P1S, P1Q and P1H) were
expressed separately, or co-expressed with the gene encoding
MetAP-⁄TG, in E. coli BL21 (DE3). All genes are under transcrip-
tional control of the T7 promoter and the enzymes were produced
either constitutively (pET-20b(+) based expression vectors) or
under control of thelac operator (pET-26 and pET-29 based expres-
sion vectors). The 4-OT variants were puriﬁed to near homogeneity
654 B.-J. Baas et al. / FEBS Open Bio 4 (2014) 651–658
by a two-step column chromatography protocol. The typical yield
of the 4-OT variants was 10–25 mg per liter of cell culture.
MetAP-⁄TG was used only as anin vivocatalyst in the co-produc-
tion experiments and as such was not puriﬁed from the expression
host. The over-production of MetAP-⁄TG was evaluated by analyz-
ing the total soluble protein fraction on SDS–PAGE gels, and the
band corresponding to MetAP-⁄TG is observed around 30 kDa.
The level of over-production of MetAP-⁄TG that has been observed
was assumed to be sufﬁcient for the removal of the amino-termi-
nal methionine residue of the 4-OT variants.
The demethionylation efﬁciency of the 4-OT variants was deter-
mined by analyzing the puriﬁed proteins by electrospray ioniza-
tion mass spectrometry (ESI-MS). The ratio of the peak area
corresponding to the processed and non-processed (+131 Da) frac-
tion was used to calculate the percentage of processed (demeth-
ionylated) 4-OT variant in each batch (Table 1). The 4-OT P1S
variant was found to be fully processed by wild-type MetAP from
the expression host, thus co-expression with the engineered
MetAP-⁄TG was not necessary. The variants 4-OT P1H and 4-OT
P1Q, however, were found not to be processed by wild-type MetAP.
Co-expression of these variants with the engineered MetAP-⁄TG
showed that post-translational processing can be achieved
in vivo; however, the efﬁciency of methionine removal differed
signiﬁcantly between puriﬁed protein samples from different
growth experiments.
For the 4-OT P1H variant, 20–80% methionine removal was gen-
erally observed. The highest percentage of processing (87%,Table 1)
was obtained by expressing 4-OT P1H constitutively (pET-20b(+)-
based expression vector) and MetAP-⁄TG under control of thelac
operator (pET-29b(+)-based expression vector). IPTG was added
to the growth medium prior to the inoculation of the medium, to
ensure expression of MetAP-⁄TG from the start as the 4-OT variant
to be processed is expressed constitutively. For the 4-OT P1Q var-
iant, the highest percentage of processing (68%, Table 1) was
achieved by expressing MetAP- ⁄TG constitutively (pET-20b(+)-
based expression vector) and the 4-OT P1Q variant under control
of the lac operator (pET-26b(+)-based expression vector). This
alternative way of co-expressing the 4-OT P1Q variant with
MetAP-⁄TG with respect to the system used for the P1H variant
was developed because of low demethionylation efﬁciencies
(<20%) for the P1Q variant using the original method. Reasoning
that an ample amount of MetAP-⁄TG needs to be present at the
start of production of the 4-OT P1Q variant, the gene of 4-OT
P1Q was cloned into an alternative vector under control of the
lac operator. Instead, cloning the gene of MetAP-⁄TG in the pET-
20b(+) vector ensured constitutive expression of the demethiony-
lation catalyst. Using this expression system, the production of
MetAP-⁄TG prior to that of the 4-OT P1Q variant can be guaranteed
and up to 68% methionine removal was achieved.
An interesting observation made from the ESI-MS analysis of
the P1Q variant is that the demethionylated protein was found to
have a mass of 6825 ± 1 Da, instead of 6842 Da, which is the calcu-
lated mass of the demethionylated P1Q variant. The mass differ-
ence of 17 Da can be explained by the expulsion of ammonia
upon intramolecular cyclization of the amino-terminal glutamine
(deamination) to form the proline analogue pyroglutamate
(Fig. 3). Since a peak corresponding to a mass of 6842 Da (amino-
terminal glutamine) is absent in the ESI-MS spectrum of this puri-
ﬁed batch, the demethionylated fraction of this protein appears to
harbor exclusively a pyroglutamate at the amino-terminus.
To investigate whether the loss of 17 Da indeed occurs at the
amino-terminal position and not somewhere else in the protein,
a new puriﬁed batch of the P1Q variant was produced, which by
ESI-MS analysis was shown to consist of a mixture of three
proteins with masses of 6825 ± 1 Da, 6842 ± 1 Da and
6973 ± 1 Da, which correspond to the P1pE, P1Q and M1P2Q vari-
ants, respectively. This protein mixture was digested with endo-
proteinase GluC and the resulting peptides were analyzed by
nano-LC–MS (Table 2). The results clearly demonstrate that the
modiﬁcation that leads to a loss of 17 Da was exclusively associ-
ated with the peptide corresponding to the amino-terminus of
the protein (note the 17 kDa difference in the masses of the
QIAQIHILE and pEIAQIHILE peptides). Subsequent nano-LC–MS/
MS analysis of the QIAQIHILE and pEIAQIHILE peptides gave char-
acteristic sets of b-ions, which revealed that the net loss of 17 Da
occurs at the N-terminal residue (Table 2). Thus, the protein spe-
cies with a mass of 6825 Da observed in reconstructed ESI mass
spectra of the 4-OT P1Q variant most likely corresponds to a pro-
tein harboring an amino-terminal pyroglutamate.
To provide further evidence for the formation of an amino-ter-
minal pyroglutamate, we have used the mixture of P1pE, P1Q and
M1P2Q variants in labeling studies with 3-bromopyruvate (3BP).
This compound is a well-studied afﬁnity probe for 4-OT, with the
amino-terminal proline (Pro-1) being the sole target of modiﬁca-
tion [33,34]. Incubation of wild-type 4-OT with 3BP leads to alkyl-
ation of the prolyl-nitrogen with a pyruvoyl-group, which is the
result of nucleophilic attack of Pro-1 on the C3-carbon of 3BP, lead-
ing to the expulsion of bromide and alkylation of Pro-1[33,34].
Interestingly, incubation of the protein mixture with 3BP did not
result in labeling of the protein fraction with an observed mass
of 6825 Da, whereas the fractions with a mass of 6842 Da and
6973 Da were partially labeled (Table 3). In a separate control reac-
tion using identical conditions, wild-type 4-OT was found to be
completely labeled (Table 3). The partial labeling of the P1Q
(6842 Da) and M1P2Q (6973 Da) proteins harboring a primary
amine functionality at their amino-terminus, follows the trend in
reduced nucleophilicity of a primary amine versus a secondary
amine (i.e., proline). Moreover, the complete loss of reactivity
towards 3BP of the protein species with a mass of 6825 Da is indic-
ative of an amino-terminal residue with poor nucleophilicity,
which is consistent with the expected low reactivity of pyrogluta-
mate. Taken together, the results provide convincing evidence that
the substitution of Pro-1 by Gln, followed by removal of the initi-
ating Met, results in cyclization of Gln-1 to form pyroglutamate
at the N-terminus.
The demethionylation efﬁciencies of the 4-OT P1Q and 4-OT
P1H variants are slightly lower than those reported by Liao and
coworkers for glutamine and histidine substitutions at the penulti-

mate position of their target proteins[22]. SDS–PAGE analysis of
the E. coli cell lysate showed that the level of expression of
MetAP-⁄TG when co-expressed with the variants 4-OT P1Q and
4-OT P1H is similar to that reported by Liao et al.[22]. The slightly
lower efﬁciency of methionine removal for the 4-OT variants is
therefore unlikely to be due to an insufﬁcient amount of demeth-
ionylation catalyst. As MetAP-⁄TG utilizes a pair of Co++ ions as a
cofactor, the amount of MetAP-⁄TG produced by overexpression
might exceed the trace amount of Co++ ions that is present in the
growth medium [22]. To eliminate this concern, the 4-OT P1Q
and 4-OT P1H variants were co-expressed with MetAP-⁄TG under
conditions that were found to result in the best achievable methi-
onine removal, and the growth medium was supplemented with
100 lM CoCl2. However, the addition of additional Co++ ions to
the growth medium did not result in an increased efﬁciency of
methionine removal from either the 4-OT P1Q or 4-OT P1H variant.
3.2. Tautomerase activities of the 4-OT variants
The tautomerase activities of the P1S, P1Q and P1H variants
were assayed using 2-hydroxyhexa-2,4-dienedioate as the
substrate (Fig. 1). All three variants were found to catalyze the tau-
tomerization reaction, albeit with markedly different catalytic efﬁ-
ciencies (Table 4). Before comparing the kinetic parameters, the
issue of incomplete removal of the initiating methionine in the
case of the 4-OT P1Q and 4-OT P1H variants needs to be consid-
ered. Neither the structural consequences of the presence of the
initiating methionine in the active site of 4-OT nor the effect it
has on the manner in which the monomers assemble into homo-
hexameric oligomers are known. The kinetic parameters of the
4-OT P1Q and 4-OT P1H variants reported inTable 4likely repre-
sent those observed for a mixture of active sites with and without
the amino-terminal methionine. The puriﬁed batches of each vari-
ant that showed the highest percentage of methionine removal
(Table 1) were used for the activity assay. The 4-OT P1S variant
was found to be fully demethionylated, thus the kinetic parameters

reported in Table 4 for this variant may be directly compared to
those of the wild-type enzyme.
All three Pro-1 variants of 4-OT show a signiﬁcant decrease in
kcat, whereas the Km values are little affected, conﬁrming that
Pro-1 is a critical residue for catalysis. The 4-OT P1Q variant, puri-
ﬁed as the mixture P1pE/M1P2Q, was found to be the most efﬁ-
cient tautomerase of the three 4-OT mutants with a kcat of
133 s/C01. The overall catalytic efﬁciency (in terms ofkcat/Km) is only
/C2425-fold lower than that of wild-type 4-OT. Of all Pro-1 variants of
4-OT that have been characterized to date, the P1pE/M1P2Q pro-
tein exhibits the highest catalytic efﬁciency towards the native
tautomerase substrate[17,18]. To address how much M1P2Q con-
tributes to the tautomerase activity of the P1pE/M1P2Q mixture,
we produced the P1Q variant without co-expression of
MetAP-⁄TG. ESI-MS analysis of the puriﬁed protein revealed a sin-
gle peak in the reconstructed mass spectrum corresponding to
6973 ± 1 Da, which shows that the protein was isolated solely as
the M1P2Q species (calculated mass: 6973 Da). This allowed us
to characterize the tautomerase activity of the non-demethionylat-
ed M1P2Q protein, which catalyzed the tautomerization reaction
with a kcat of 45 s/C01 and a Km of 130lM( Table 4). Interestingly,
when comparing these kinetic parameters to those obtained for
the same reaction catalyzed by the P1pE/M1P2Q mixture, no
change in Km was observed but thekcat was found to be lowered
about 3-fold. As the M1P2Q fraction only constitutes about 30%
of the total of the P1pE/M1P2Q mixture, these kinetic data suggest
that the P1pE-fraction makes a contribution to the observedkcat of
the P1pE/M1P2Q mixture. However, it is important to emphasize
that the electron-withdrawing property of the carbonyl functional-
ity of pyroglutamate results in a much lowered basicity of itsc-lac-
tam nitrogen with respect to the secondary amine functionality of
proline, making it highly unlikely that pyroglutamate plays a direct
role in catalysis.
The kinetic parameters determined for the P1S variant show
that it functions as a tautomerase with akcat of 15 s/C01. As theKm
was found to be unaffected by the P1S substitution and the 4-OT
P1S mutant was found to be fully demethionylated, the detrimen-
tal effect onkcat with respect to wild-type is likely due to either
poor positioning and/or activation of the serine-1 hydroxyl as a
catalytic base or the weaker basicity of the primary amine func-
tionality of this residue. The signiﬁcant decrease inkcat and unaf-
fected Km are consistent with the trends observed for the P1G
and P1A variants analyzed by Whitman and coworkers[17]. Thus,
the weaker basicity of the primary amine functionality of Ser-1 as
compared to the secondary amine functionality of Pro-1 is likely to
be the cause for the observed decrease inkcat.
The 4-OT P1H variant, puriﬁed as the mixture P1H/M1P2H, has
very low-level activity with a kcat of 0.07 s/C01. The Km is little
affected by the histidine substitution, as it is increased only
/C241.5-fold with respect to that of the wild-type enzyme. As the
batch of enzyme used in this kinetic assay consists for 87% of
demethionylated enzyme, the large decrease in kcat cannot be
explained by the presence of the initiating methionine on the
remaining 13% of enzyme. Therefore, the large decrease inkcat is
likely due to the presence of the histidine residue at the amino ter-
minus. Hence, either the secondary amine functionality of His-1
functions as a poor catalytic base, or the relatively large side chain
of His-1 causes a poor positioning of the amino-terminal primary
amine functionality, thereby impairing its ability to function as
the catalytic base.
3.3. Oxaloacetate decarboxylase activity of 4-OT P1S
Dawson and coworkers have previously shown that the P1A and
P1G mutants of 4-OT exhibit promiscuous decarboxylase activity
using oxaloacetate as the substrate[18]. This prompted us to test
whether the P1S mutant of 4-OT, the variant that is fully processed,
has oxaloacetate decarboxylase activity (Table 4). Indeed, the P1S
mutant possesses decarboxylase activity, but its catalytic efﬁciency
is /C2440- and/C244-fold lower than that reported for the P1A and P1G
variants, respectively.
The mechanism of oxaloacetate decarboxylation by 4-OT P1A
was proposed to involve covalent catalysis[18]. A reductive amina-
tion performed on a reaction mixture containing oxaloacetate and
the P1A variant resulted in alkylation of the amino-terminus of the
protein by a species with a mass consistent with that of the cova-
lent adduct of one pyruvate molecule[18]. This ﬁnding is consis-
tent with a mechanism in which the amino-terminal primary
amine functionality acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl
carbon atom of the substrate, forming a covalent imine intermedi-
ate that acts as an electron sink, thereby facilitating decarboxyl-
ation of the C4 carboxylate group. The resulting product,
pyruvate, can be liberated from the amino-terminus by hydrolysis
[18]. A similar reductive amination experiment was performed
with the P1S variant (and the P1A variant as a control), followed
by ESI-MS analysis of the protein to reveal the presence of a cova-
lent adduct. Incubation of the P1S variant (1 mg) with oxaloacetate
(10 mM) and subsequent reduction by NaCNBH
3 showed a major
peak at 6874 ± 1 Da and a minor peak at 6802 ± 1 Da (P1S mono-
mer) in the ESI-MS spectrum with a ratio of 5–1. The major peak
corresponds to the monomer modiﬁed by a single adduct of
72 Da. The same modiﬁcation of 72 Da was observed for the con-
trol experiment performed with the P1A mutant. Incubation of
the P1S variant (1 mg) with pyruvate (10 mM), however, yielded
an ESI-MS spectrum that showed a major peak at 6802 ± 1 Da
(P1S monomer) and a minor peak at 6874 ± 1 Da (P1S mono-
mer + 72 Da) in a ratio of 5–1. These ﬁndings are consistent with
the observations reported by Dawson and coworkers, the 72 Da
adduct corresponding to pyruvate[18]. The reversal of the ratio
between the native and the alkylated monomer that was observed
when the P1S variant was incubated with pyruvate (instead of oxa-
loacetate), strongly suggests that the pyruvate-adduct that is
observed when the protein is incubated with oxaloacetate is an
intermediate of the decarboxylation reaction, rather than the result
of alkylation by pyruvate (as a product of decarboxylation) that is
released into solution.
3.4. Concluding remarks
In conclusion, the P1S variant of 4-OT, which carries a relatively
small residue at the penultimate position, was found to be fully
demethionylated by wild-type methionine aminopeptidase
(MetAP) from theE. coliexpression host. Like the previously stud-
ied P1G and P1A variants of 4-OT, the P1S variant has low-level 2-
hydroxymuconate tautomerase and promiscuous oxaloacetate
decarboxylase activity. The latter activity likely involves the forma-
tion of a covalent imine intermediate between the amino-terminal
amine functionality of Ser-1 and the ketoacid substrate. The P1Q
and P1H variants of 4-OT, which carry bulky penultimate residues,
could only be obtained in a demethionylated form (a minor frac-
tion of the puriﬁed protein is composed of methionylated enzyme)
by co-expression with an engineered variant of MetAP, termed
MetAP-⁄TG. Whereas the P1H variant (i.e., the mixture of P1H/
M1P2H) has very low-level tautomerase activity, both the meth-
ionylated P1Q variant of 4-OT (M1P2Q; k
cat =4 5s/C01) and the
demethionylated P1Q variant of 4-OT, which by spontaneous intra-
molecular cyclization is converted into the P1pE variant, appear to
function as 2-hydroxymuconate tautomerases (P1pE/M1P2Q mix-
ture; kcat = 133 s/C01). The precise catalytic activity of the 4-OT
P1pE variant, and which residue of 4-OT P1pE is responsible for
deprotonating the enol functionality of the substrate, remains to
be determined, which awaits the preparation of homogenous

P1pE enzyme. In future work, we therefore aim to produce 4-OT
P1pE in E. coli via intracellular cleavage of a N-terminal fusion
tag with tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease, according to a recently
published method for overproduction of N-terminal pE-modiﬁed
proteins [35].
The substitution of Pro-1 by a glutamine, followed byin vivo
removal of the initiating methionine and cyclization (i.e., deamina-
tion) of the glutamine, is a unique way to obtain a structural
analogue of proline (5-oxoproline,Fig. 3) on the amino-terminus
of 4-OT. This opens up new possibilities to study the catalytic
importance of Pro-1 in the recently discovered promiscuous C–C
bond-forming aldolase and ‘Michaelase’ activities of 4-OT
[10–14]. Labeling studies performed with the afﬁnity probe 3BP
demonstrate that pyroglutamate is less nucleophilic as proline in
the active site of 4-OT. This makes the P1pE variant an excellent
negative control in the study of nucleophilic addition reactions cat-
alyzed by 4-OT.
