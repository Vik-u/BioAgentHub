The content and proportion of sugars and acids in tomato fruit directly affect
its ﬂavor quality. Previous studies have shown that 5-aminolevulinic acid
(ALA) could promote fruit ripening and improve its aroma quality. In order to
explore the effect of ALA on sugar and acid quality during tomato fruit
development, 0, 100, and 200 mg L−1 ALA solutions were sprayed on the
fruit surface 10 days after pollination of the fourth inﬂorescence, and the
regulation of ALA on sugar, acid metabolism andﬂavor quality of tomato fruit
was analyzed. The results showed that ALA treatment could enhance the
activities of acid invertase (AI), neutral invertase (NI), and sucrose synthase
(SS), reduce the activity of sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS), up-regulate the
expression of SlAI, SlNI and SlSS, change the composition and content of
sugar in tomato fruit at three stages, signiﬁcantly increase the content of
sugars in fruit, and promote the accumulation of sugars intoﬂesh. Secondly,
ALA treatments increased the activities of phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxykinase (PEPC), malic enzyme (ME), and citrate synthase (CS), up-
regulated the expression ofSlPPC2, SlME1, andSlCS, and reduced the citric
acid content at maturity stage, thereby reducing the total organic acid
content. In addition, ALA could also increase the number and mass fraction
of volatile components in mature tomato fruits. These results indicated that
exogenous application of ALA during tomato fruit development could
promote the formation of fruit aroma quality and were also conducive to
the formation of fruit sugar and acid quality.

1 Introduction
As one of the most popular vegetables, tomato ( Solanum
lycopersicum) stands out for its abundant nutritional content and
distinctive ﬂavor. At present, consumers are keen on tomatoes with
the perceived “perfect taste”, making taste preference a signiﬁcant
factor in tomato selection and consumption ( Li et al., 2018 ).
Tomato fruit quality mainly co nsists of appearance quality,
nutritional quality, ﬂavor quality, processing, and storage quality
(Lipan et al., 2021 ; Li et al., 2023 ). Among them, ﬂavor
quality primarily comprises sweetness (which is related to sugars
in fruits), sourness (which is related to acids in fruits), and aromatic
smell (which is related to volatile aromatic substances in fruits). The
loss ofﬂavor in tomato fruits can signiﬁcantly impact their sensory
quality, thus affecting their economic value (Maul et al., 2000).
The soluble sugar in tomato f ruit primarily comes from
photosynthesis and sucrose metabolism ( Powell et al., 2012 ).
Moreover, notable variations in sugar accumulation and
composition exist among diverse tomato varieties and fruit
samples ( Lombardo et al., 2011 ). Sucrose synthesis and
decomposition in fruit were affected by enzymatic activities,
including sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS), sucrose synthase
(SS), and invertase (Ivr). Sucrose synthase (SS) is classiﬁed into
sucrose synthase-synthesis (SS-S) enzyme and sucrose synthase-
decomposition (SS-C) enzyme due to its dual functionality in both
sucrose synthesis and sucrose decomposition during different stages
of plant development. Invertase (Ivr) is categorized into acid
invertase (AI) and neutral invertase (NI) based on the distinct pH
conditions in the fruit under which they operate (Klann et al., 1993;
Yamaki, 2010). Among these enzymes, sucrose phosphate synthase
(SPS) and sucrose synthase-synthesis direction (SS-S) play a role in
synthesizing sucrose, thereby promoting an increase in sucrose
content. On the other hand, invertase (Ivr) and sucrose synthase-
decomposition direction (SS-C) enzymes are involved in the
breakdown of sucrose, leading to a reduction in sucrose content.
In addition, glucose metabolism is also affected by various factors.
The study revealed that varying light qualities have different effects
on the activity of sucrose metabolic enzymes in tomato leaves (Li
et al., 2017). The application of methyl jasmonate increased the
activities of amylase, sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS), and sucrose
synthase (SUS) in tomato fruit ,m e a n w h i l e ,i td e c r e a s e dt h e
activities of acid invertase (AI) and neutral invertase (NI). As a
consequence, the ripening quality of tomato fruit was enhanced (Li
et al., 2022 ). Water de ﬁcit condition positively regulated the
expression of sucrose synthase genes, includingSlSUSY4, SlSPS1,
SlCIN3, SlVIN2, andSlCWIN2, in tomato fruit, thus promoting the
accumulation of sucrose in fruit (Barbosa et al., 2023).
Tomato fruit typically accumulatesc i t r i ca c i da n dm a l i ca c i d ,a l o n g
with minor amounts of tartaric acid,o x a l i ca c i d ,a n ds h i k i m i ca c i d
(Bahrami et al., 2001; Xin et al., 2012). Most of the organic acids in the
fruit primarily originate from the TCA cycle. As the main intermediate
products in the TCA cycle, their content is affected by the activity of the
main metabolic enzymes in the cycle.Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase
(PEPC) catalyzes the carboxylation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to
produce oxaloacetate acid, and form malic acid under the action of
malate dehydrogenase (MDH) (Notton and Blanke, 1993). Then, it is
decomposed into pyruvic acid and carbon dioxide under the catalysis of
malic enzyme (ME) (Edwards and Andreo, 1992). Moreover, citric acid
is generated by citrate synthase (CS) with the participation of acetyl
CoA. Under the catalysis of aconitase (ACO), citric acid is initially
decomposed to form isocitric acid, and thena-ketoglutaric acid and
carbon dioxide are formed under the action of corresponding
dehydrogenase (Edwards and Andreo, 1992). During the early stages
of tomato fruit ripening, the activity of ME is enhanced, and L-malic
acid is decarboxylated to pyruvic acid, and the malic acid content will
decrease sharply. Simultaneously, the continuous action of MDH and
CS will lead to the reduction of L-malic acid levels, and citric acid will be
preferentially accumulated. Therefore, the content of citric acid reaches
the maximum at the breaker stage of fruit, and then its content will
show different trends (increase, decrease, orﬂat) with the ripening
process, and other acids will continue to decrease during this process
(Davies and Maw, 1972; Oms-Oliu et al., 2011). Researchers found that
the core metabolic process of grapes (Vitis viniferaL.) during ripening is
mainly determined by temperature (Rienth et al., 2016). Hot air
treatment could signiﬁcantly up-regulate the degradation of citric acid
and fructose and glucose accumulation-related gene expression in
ponkan (Citrus reticulata)( Chen et al., 2012 ). In addition to
environmental factors, the effects of agronomic measures and
exogenous substances on organic acid metabolism cannot be ignored.
The treatment with 4% CaCl2 treatment exhibited a notable impact on
the regulation of malic acid metabolism by promoting the activity of
malic acid metabolic enzymes in apples (Malus pumilaMill.). This
treatment led to the up-regulation of malic acid biosynthesis and
transport genes, along with the down-regulation of malic acid
degradation genes ( Han et al., 2020 ). Furthermore,1-MCP (1-
methylcyclopropene) maintained fruit acidity by modulating the
b a l a n c eb e t w e e nm a l i ca c i db i osynthesis and degradation (Liu R,
et al., 2016).
5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA), a natural and non-toxic plant
growth regulator, is a vital precursor for the synthesis of tetrapyrrole
compounds in organisms, and it plays a crucial role in regulating
plant growth and development (Liu J, et al., 2016). For example,
application of exogenous ALA could improve plant tolerance under
abiotic stresses (Habiba et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018; Xiong et al.,
2018), enhance photosynthesis(Zhang et al., 2015; Feng et al., 2020),
and promote seed germination (WANG et al., 2005; Fu et al., 2014)
and fruit quality (Watanabe et al., 2006; Feng et al., 2015). It was
found that exogenous ALA treatment enhanced the ﬁxation of
peach
14C ﬁxation in peach (Prunus persica L. Batsch) leaves,
promoted the assimilation and transport to fruits, and up-regulate
the expression ofSWEET1, SWEET6, SWEET7 and other genes at
fruit ripening stage, and promote fruit sugar accumulation (Ruolin
et al., 2023). Rhizosphere application of ALA on apple could
improve fruit coloring and increase fruit soluble solids and
vitamin C content (Zheng et al., 2017).
Previous study has demonstrated that treating tomato fruits
with 200 mg L-1 exogenous ALA at the green ripening stage
signiﬁcantly enhances the ﬂavor quality and aromatic quality of
the fruits, moreover, this treatment promotes the synthesis and
accumulation of lycopene in tomato fruits (Wang J, et al., 2021).
Nevertheless, the impacts of exogenous ALA on sugar and acid
metabolism in tomato fruits have been scarcely investigated. In

N o . 1 )f r u i t sw e r ee m p l o y e da st h et e s tm a t e r i a l .D i f f e r e n t
concentrations of ALA solution were sprayed on the fruits ten
days after pollination, and subsequently, the ALA solution was
applied once every 10 days until the fruit reached maturity. This
research focuses on investigating the regulatory effects of
exogenous ALA on the sugar and acid metabolism, as well as
the ﬂavor quality of tomato fruit. The study involved measuring
the content of soluble sugar, organic acid components, the activity
of related metabolic enzymes, an d gene expression levels in
tomato fruit at different developmental stages. These ﬁndings
serve as a valuable theoretical foundation for improving high-
quality tomato cultivation techniques and the application of ALA
in the agricultural domain.
2 Material and methods
2.1 Plant materials and experimental design
The study employed Tomato ( Solanum lycopersicum cv.
Yuanwei No. 1) obtained from Beijing Lvbaiwang Agricultural
Technology Research Institute as the experimental material. The
plants were grown and harvested in a solar greenhouse located in
Lanzhou City, China (35.87°N, 104.09°E).
After the fourth inﬂorescence of tomato plants blossomed, the
pollination date was recorded on December 17, 2020. Ten days after
pollination, the fruits with a diameter of approximately 1 cm were
treated with an exogenous ALA solution (0, 100, 200 mg L-1). The
treatment was administered once every 10 days until the fruit
reached maturity, with a total of 5 treatments. Meanwhile, 0.01%
Tween-20 was added as a spreading agent in all the sprayed
solutions. The concentration of ALA treatment used in this study
was based on previous study (Wang J, et al., 2021). Each treatment
was replicated three times, with 20 tomato plants randomly selected
and marked for each repetition. Tomato fruits were sampled at
three different growth stages: the mature green stage (January 8,
2021 to January 15, 2021), the color breaker stage (January 27, 2021
to February 4, 2021), and the maturity stage (February 11, 2021 to
February 15, 2021). For each treatment and growth stage, 15 fruits
were randomly selected. The fruits were cut into two halves from
the central equatorial region. After peeling, the seed and gelatinous
placenta were removed. The remainingﬂesh, columella, and septum
tissues were weighed and frozen in liquid nitrogen before being
stored at -80°C for later use.
2.2 Determination of endogenous ALA
content in tomato fruit
The ALA measurement was conducted following the method
and adjustment of Wu et al. (Wu Y, et al., 2018). Speciﬁcally, 5 g of
frozen tomatoﬂesh, columella, and septum samples were placed in
a mortar with 6 mL acetate buffer (pH 4.6) in ice bath. After
grinding, the sample was transferred into a 10 mL centrifuge tube
and centrifuged at 5000 g for 15 minutes at 4°C. Following this, the
supernatant (3 mL) was mixed with four drops of acetylacetic ester
and incubated at 100°C for 10 minutes in a water bath to initiate a
condensation reaction. After cooling to room temperature, a fresh
Ehrlich’s reagent solution was prepared by mixing 42 mL of glacial
acetic acid, 8 mL of 70% perchloric acid, and 1 g of
dimethylaminobenzaldehyde. The resulting mixture was shaken
well and placed for color development for 25 minutes. The
sample ’s absorbance at 554 nm was measured through an
ultraviolet spectrophotomet er (UV-1800, SHIMADZU, Japan).
The ALA content (nmol g-1, FW) was determined by utilizing a
standard curve of ALA reference standards.
2.3 Determination of sugar components in
tomato fruit
To extract sugar components, we followed and adjusted the
method of Li et al. (Li et al., 2023) subsequently conducted tests on
sucrose, fructose, and glucos e in tomato fruits using high-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). We prepared a
homogenate of 5 g frozen tomato ﬂesh, columella, and septum
tissues using a mortar. The homogenate was then transferred into a
50 mL centrifuge tube (rinsed three times) and diluted to 25 mL. To
determine the soluble sugar contents, the fruits were subjected to
ultrasonic shaking at 30°C for 60 minutes and then centrifuged at
10,000 rpm for 10 minutes. The resulting supernatant (1.5 mL) was
aspirated, and the ﬁltrate was collected through a 0.22 mm
ﬁlter membrane.
The mobile phase was established as a volume ratio of 3:1
acetonitrile to ultra-pure water. The ﬂowrate was set to 1.0 mL
min-1 and the column temperature was maintained at 30°C. An
injection volume of 10 mL was used and liquid chromatography
sugar column LC-NH2 (460 mm×250 mm) was employed. The
differential refractive index detector used was Aglient series 1100
(USA). The contents of fructose, glucose, and sucrose were
determined in each tissue part of each treatment, which were
repeated three times. Total soluble sugar was equal to the sum of
fructose, glucose, and sucrose.
2.4 Determination of sucrose metabolism-
related enzyme activity
To determine the activity of sucrose metabolism-related
enzymes in tomato fruits, the following quantitative detection kits
were utilized: a plant sucrose synthase (decomposition direction)
quantitative detection kit, plant sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS)
quantitative detection kit, plant acid invertase (AI) quantitative
detection kit, and plant neutral invertase (NI) quantitative detection
kit (Ruixin Biotechnology Company Ltd, Quanzhou, China). The
speciﬁc operation was conducted in accordance with the product
description for each kit. In this study, each treatment and tissue
were replicated three times. The enzyme activity was calculated
based on the standard curve.

Frontiers inPlant Science frontiersin.org03
2.5 Determination of organic acid
components in tomato fruit
The levels of shikimate oxalic, malic, citric, quinic, and tartaric
acids of tomato fruit were detected using HPLC. The determination
method was performed following the chromatographic conditions
previously described by Coelho et al. (Coelho et al., 2018) with
minor modiﬁcations. The frozen tomato fruit tissues (5 g) from the
ﬂesh, columella and septum were homogenized using a mortar and
then transferred into a 50 mL centrifuge tube (which was rinsed
three times) and diluted to 25 mL. Subsequently, the homogenate
was centrifuged at 4°C and 10000 rpm for 10 min. After
centrifugation, 1.5 ml of supernatant was extracted with a syringe
and ﬁltered through a 0.22mm nylon membrane. A volume of 1.5
mL of the ﬁltered solution was injected for the determination of
related components.
For the determination, an HPLC method was employed. The
chromatographic column was Aglient C14 (300 mm × 7.7 mm).
The detection was conducted using a diode-array detector (DAD) at
210 nm. The mobile phase used was 0.085% phosphoric acid. The
column temperature was set to 30°C. Theﬂow rate was 0.8 mL
min
-1, and the injection volume was 20mL. Each treatment and site
were repeated 3 times. The total organic acid content was calculated
as the sum of shikimate oxalic, malic, citric, quinic, and
tartaric acids.
2.6 Determination of citric and malic acid
anabolism-related enzyme activity
The activity of enzymes involved in malic acid and citric acid
metabolism was determined using quantitative detection kits for
phosphoenolpyruvate kinase ( P E P C ) ,c i t r a t es y n t h a s e( C S ) ,
aconitase (ACO), malic enzyme (ME), and malate dehydrogenase
(MDH) from Ruixin Biotechnology Company Ltd, Quanzhou,
China. The speci ﬁc procedures were conducted in accordance
with the product description. E ach treatment and tissue was
repeated three times. The activity of the relevant was calculated
based on the standard curve.
2.7 Determination of volatile
components content
Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used with
reference to the method of Xie et al. (Xie et al., 2022)and slightly
modiﬁed. The frozenﬂesh, columella, and septum tissues (3g each)
were homogenized and subsequently transferred to a 15 mL brown
headspace injection bottle. Chromatographically pure anhydrous
Na2SO4 (1.5 g) and 2-octanol standard sample (10 mL) with a
concentration of 88.2 mg L-1, were added to the bottle. The mixture
was stirred using a magnetic stirring rotor and the cap was quickly
tightened after placing the pad. After that, the tomato fruit samples
were equilibrated for 10 minutes ona magnetic stirrer set at a constant
temperature of 50°C. Subsequently, the extraction needle was inserted
into 1/3 of the injection bottle. The extraction process was carried out at
50°C for 30 minutes. Upon completion of the extraction, the extraction
needle was inserted into the chromatographic gasiﬁcation chamber and
resolved for 3 minutes before being analyzed using GC-MS for 30
minutes. Each treatment was repeated 3 times.
Only volatile substances with matching degrees > 70 were
identiﬁed. The content of each volatile aromatic substance was
calculated as follows:
Contentðmg kg-1Þ¼ A1
A2 /C2 M1
M2 /C2 1000
Where A1 and A2 are the peak areas of determined and the
internal standard, respectively; M1 and M2 are the amount of the
internal standard (mg) and sample (g), respectively.
2.8 Total RNA extraction and relative gene
expression analysis
Total RNA was extracted using the RNAprep Pure Plant Plus
Kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China) according to the
manufacturer ’s protocol. The cDNA synthesis was performed
using a FastKing RT Kit (Tiangen Biotech) according to the
manufacturer’s protocol. The tomato actin gene was used as an
internal control. Quantitative analysis was performed using the
Light Cycle 96 RT-qPCR instrument (Roche, Switzerland). The
GenBank accession numbers of the sequences used to design
the primers are listed inTable 1. The relative expression of genes
was calculated by the 2-DDCT method, and each gene expression
analysis was performed in three independent biological replicates.
2.9 Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis and data visualization were performed using
Excel 2016 and Origin 2022 software (OriginLab, Northampton,
MA, USA). For data analysis, SPSS version 23.0 (IBM Corp.,
Armonk, NY, United States) was used. Duncan’s multiple range
tests of variance (P< 0.05) were employed for signiﬁcance testing.
3 Results
3.1 The endogenous ALA changes during
fruit development
Endogenous ALA was identi ﬁed as the precursor of all
tetrapyrrole compounds found in tomato fruit, as illustrated in
Figure 1. At the mature green stage, theﬂesh and septum of the
tomato fruit exhibited higher ALA content compared to the
columella. After treated with exogenous ALA, the endogenous
ALA content in each tissue increased, with a signiﬁcant increase
observed in the T200 treatment. However, at the breaker stage, the
endogenous ALA content in theﬂesh and septum decreased rapidly.
Moreover, the endogenous ALA content in the septum tissue was
Li et al. 10.3389/fpls.2023.1323048
Frontiers inPlant Science frontiersin.org04
signiﬁcantly reduced under T100 and T200 treatments, with a
reduction of 11.7% and 27.5% respectively compared to the
control. Additionally, at the maturity stage, the endogenous ALA
content decreased rapidly in the columella and septum.
3.2 The total sugar and organic acid
changes during fruit development
The ﬂesh of T100 and T200 treatments revealed a signiﬁcant
increase in total soluble sugar content by 22.0% and 35.8%
respectively, compared to the control (Figure 2A). In comparison
to the control group, the total soluble sugar content in the columella
increased signiﬁcantly by 8.3% and 12.9%, respectively. Similarly,
the septum exhibited a signiﬁcant increase in total soluble sugar
content by 11.5% and 23.3%. The soluble sugar content in the fruit
treated with exogenous ALA was found to be the highest in the
ﬂesh, followed by septum and columella, with signiﬁcant differences
observed among the different tissues. It indicated that exogenous
ALA not only promoted the synthesis and accumulation of sugars,
but also facilitated their translocation to theﬂesh. Notably, the T200
treatment exhibited the most pronounced effect.

The ALA treatments at the mature green stage resulted in an
increase of organic acids content in fruits (Figure 2B). However,
from the beginning of the breaker stage to the maturity stage, the
content of organic acids in different tissues of the tomato fruits
signi ﬁcantly decreased. In tomato fruits, organic acids were
predominantly accumulated in the columella. However,
exogenous ALA treatments resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction in
the total organic acid content in the columella, with the T200
treatment exhibiting the most signiﬁcant effect.
In addition, exogenous ALA treatments could signi ﬁcantly
increase the sugar-acid ratio in various tissues of tomato fruit at
different stages (Figure 2C) .A tt h em a t u r eg r e e ns t a g e ,t h es u g a r -
acid ratio in theﬂesh exhibited a signiﬁcant increase due to ALA
treatments. Moreover, during the breaker and maturity stages, the
sugar-acid ratio in the tissues of fruits treated with T100 and T200
showed a signiﬁcant increase compared to the control group. In
addition, the variation of sugar-acid ratio in each tissue of every
treatment demonstrated a similar pattern, with the highest ratio
observed in theﬂesh, followed by the septum, and the lowest in the
columella. Notably, the T200 treatment had the most profound
impact on the changes in the sugar-acid ratio.
3.3 Sugar components were enhanced by
exogenous ALA during fruit development
The contents of fructose, glucose and sucrose were increased
under the application of exogenous ALA in tomato fruits (Figure 3).
During fruit development, the application of exogenous ALA
resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in fructose content in various
tissues (Figure 3A). At the maturity stage, the fructose content in
the ﬂesh of T100 and T200 treatments was signiﬁcantly increased by
9.1% and 34.0%, respectively, compared with the control fruit. The
fructose content in the septum was signiﬁcantly increased by 14.2%
and 28.8%, respectively, while the fructose content in the columella
was signiﬁcantly increased by 8.14% and 13.3%, respectively, in
comparison to the control fruit. The fructose content in theﬂesh of
the T100 treated fruit was signiﬁcantly higher than that of the
columella and the septum. The fructose content of T200 treatment
found to be highest in theﬂesh followed by the septum and the
columella. These ﬁndings indicate that exogenous ALA not only
signiﬁcantly increases the overall fructose content of the fruit but
also promotes preferential fr uctose accumulation in the ﬂesh.
Notably, the T200 treatment exhibited the most pronounced

effect in this regard.
During the ripening process of tomato fruit, the glucose content
showed an increasing trend (Figure 3B). At the mature green stage,
T100 and T200 treatments signi ﬁcantly increased the glucose
content in the ﬂesh, which increased by 15.4% and 16.1%,
respectively, compared with the control. Under the same
treatment conditions, the content in the columella was the lowest,
followed by the septum. At the breaker stage, ALA treatments
signiﬁcantly increased the glucose content in each tissue. At the
maturity stage, the glucose content in theﬂesh of T100 and T200
treated fruits was signiﬁcantly higher than that of the control. This
promotive effect was similarly observed in columella and septum.
The fruit treated with T100 and T200 exhibited the highest glucose
content in theﬂesh, followed by the septum and columella. Notably,
there were signi ﬁcant differences in glucose content between
each tissue.
During the mature green stage, the content of sucrose was the
highest in the fruitﬂesh, followed by septum, and then columella.
The breaker and maturity stages showed the highest in the septum,
followed by theﬂesh, and the least in the columella. The sucrose
accumulation in different tissu es of ALA-treated tomato fruit
increased differently. At the mature green stage, both T100 and
T200 treatments led to signiﬁcant increases in sucrose content
across different tomato tissues. Speci ﬁcally, sucrose content
increased by 6.9% and 21.1% in theﬂesh, 6.7% and 10.0% in the
columella, and 4.4% and 11.0% in the septum, respectively. During
the breaker period, the sucrose content in ﬂesh and columella
increased signiﬁcantly. At the maturity stage, ALA treatments
signiﬁcantly increased the sucrose content in each tissue. In T200
treatment, the sucrose content in ﬂesh, columella and septum
increased by 61.9%, 71.1% and 54.5% compared with the control
group, and T100 treatment increased by 46.2%, 39.4% and 36.2%,
respectively (Figure 3C).
3.4 The sucrose metabolic enzymes and
gene expression during fruit development
ALA treatments remarkably increased the AI activity of each
tissue in each stage (Figure 4A). At the mature green stage, the
activity of AI increased most obviously, reaching 0.6 to 2.5 times
compared to that of control. Throughout the breaker stage and the
maturity stage, the most substantial increase in AI activity within
ALA treatments was observed in theﬂesh and septum tissues.
The ALA treatments enhanced NI activity at the mature green
stage (Figure 4B). T200 treatment signiﬁcantly increased the NI
activity by 4.3% and 17.9% inﬂesh and septum, respectively. At the
breaker stage, the NI activity in theﬂesh was signiﬁcantly higher
than that in the other tissues. T100 and T200 treatments
signiﬁcantly increased by 4.1% and 12.5% in ﬂesh, 14.6% and

18.4% in the columella, and 15.5% and 43.2% in the septum. At the
maturity stage, the activity of NI in each tissue decreased after ALA
treatments, and the activity in theﬂesh was higher, followed by the
columella, and the septum was the lowest.
The activity of sucrose synthase (decomposition) (SS-C)
gradually decreased with fruit ripening (Figure 4C). At mature
green stage, exogenous ALA signiﬁcantly increased SS-C activity in
ﬂesh, but decreased it in columella, with the T200 treatment
exhibiting a reduction of 5.8% compared to the control. During
the breaker stage, the SS-C activity in septum of T100 and T200
treatments was signiﬁcantly reduced by 26.6% and 44.2% compared
to that of control. At the maturity stage, the SS-C activity of each
tissue was signiﬁcantly reduced.
The SPS activity was the lowest in the septum at the mature
green stage ( Figure 4D ). ALA treatments could signi ﬁcantly
increase the activity of SPS in the septum. At the breaker stage,
ALA treatments signiﬁcantly reduced the SPS activity in theﬂesh
and septum, but the opposite in the columella. At the maturity
stage, the SPS activity in ﬂesh, columella and septum of ALA-
treated fruits decreased signiﬁcantly, among which T100 treatment
decreased by 28.2%, 33.5% and 48.5%, and T200 treatment
decreased by 26.2%, 18.2% and 37.4%.
The relative expression levels of the four key genes involved in
the glucose metabolism pathway were shown in theFigure 5. ALA
treatments increased the expression level of SlAI (Figure 5A).
Among them, the expression level ofSlAI in the columella T200
treated at the mature green stage was 3.15 times that of the control.
The expression ofSlAI in the columella treated with T100 and T200
were 3.37 and 3.67 times higher that than of control, respectively.
The expression levels ofSlNI in ﬂesh, columella and septum were
signiﬁcantly up-regulated under ALA treatments at mature green
stage and breaker stage (Figure 5B). Besides, at the mature green
stage, ALA treatments signiﬁcantly increased the expression level of
SlSS in theﬂesh, conversely, the opposite effect was observed in both
the columella and the septum (Figure 5C). During the breaker stage,
T100 treatment signiﬁcantly up-regulated the expression ofSlSS in
the ﬂesh. During maturity stage, ALA treatments signi ﬁcantly
down-regulated the expression of SlSS in various tissues of fruit.
As shown in the Figure 5D, at the mature green stage, ALA
treatments signiﬁcantly down-regulated the expression ofSlSPS in
ﬂesh and columella. Compared with the control, T100 treatment
signiﬁcantly up-regulated the expression ofSlSPS in the septum. At
the breaker stage, ALA treatments only up-regulated the expression
of SlSPS in the columella, and the expression of SlSPS in the

columella treated with T100 and T200 was 1.44 and 3 times higher
than that of the control. At mat urity stage, ALA treatments
signiﬁcantly down-regulated the expression of SlSPS in various
fruit tissues.
3.5 Organic acids were regulated by
exogenous ALA during fruit development
The content of malic acid decreased gradually during the
ripening process of tomato fruit ( Figure 6A). The content of
malic acid in theﬂesh was the highest, followed by the columella
and the least septum. During the mature green stage, ALA
treatments signiﬁcantly increased the malic acid content inﬂesh
and septum. T100 treatment was 5.4% and 5.2% higher than that of
the control treatment, and T200 treatment was 7.0% and 14.1%
higher than that of the control treatment. During the breaker stage
and maturity stage, the effect of malic acid content in theﬂesh was
opposite to that of the mature green stage. The effects of exogenous
ALA were mainly concentrated in theﬂesh and septum.
During fruit development, the content of citric acid reached the
highest at the breaker stage, showing a trend of increasingﬁrst and
then decreasing ( Figure 6B). At the mature green stage, ALA
treatments signiﬁcantly increased the citric acid content in the
columella of tomato fruit. During the breaker stage, ALA treatments
showed the effect of reducing the content. During the maturity
stage, citric acid was reduced, and ALA treatments could promote
this reduction, still maintaining the content gradient of columella >
septum > ﬂesh. T200 treatment effect was most obvious,
signiﬁcantly reduced the citric acid content in theﬂesh and the
columella, which was signiﬁcantly lower than the control by 12.9%
and 25.6%, respectively.
Furthermore, there was a higher accumulation of tartaric acid
and quinic acid in the ﬂesh, while oxalic acid exhibited higher
accumulation in the columella, and shikimic acid showed a greater
accumulation in the septum. In addition, the application of
exogenous ALA during fruit development could reduce the
content of acids in various tissues, but the content of tartaric acid
showed an increasing trend (Figure 6C).
During the process of fruit ripening, the content of oxalic acid
was highest in the columella tissue, followed by the septum, and
lowest in theﬂesh (Figure 6D). The ALA treatments had no effect

stage, T100 and T200 treatments signi ﬁcantly reduced the
oxalic acid content in the columella, which was 11.2% and
15.7% lower than that of the control. At the maturity stage, the
oxalic acid content in each tissue under ALA treatments was
signiﬁcantly decreased.
ALA treatments signiﬁcantly reduced the content of quinic acid
in ﬂesh tissue in three stages (Figure 6E). The content of quinic acid
increased in columella and septum tissues under ALA treatments at
mature green stage.
Moreover, ALA treatments reduced the content of shikimic acid
in the ﬂesh tissue at the mature green stage. Speciﬁcally, the T100
and T200 treatments led to decrease of 6.36% and 5.1%,
respectively, compared with the control. Contrarily, ALA
treatments increased the content of shikimic acid in columella
and septum. The content of shikimic acid in each tissue was
signiﬁcantly reduced at the breaker stage under ALA treatment,
especially in theﬂesh and the columella. The ALA treatments could
signiﬁcantly reduce the content of shikimic acid in maturity stage,

and the effect of T200 ALA treatment was the most
signiﬁcant (Figure 6F).
3.6 The main organic acids metabolic
enzymes and gene expression during
fruit development
At the mature green stage, ME activity in ﬂesh tissue was
signiﬁcantly increased under ALA treatment compared with the
control. The ME activity decreased signiﬁcantly at the beginning of
the breaker stage, and ALA treatments could signiﬁcantly increase
the ME activity at this stage, with the most prominent effect of T200
treatment. At the maturity stage, there were differences between the
various tissues under the T100 treatment, and theﬂesh was 34.3%
and 18.0% higher than the columella and the septum. High ME
activity resulted in the decrease of malic acid content in ALA
treatments at the breaker stage and maturity stage (Figure 7A).
MDH activity varied during fruit development after ALA
treatments (Figure 7B). At the mature green stage, the MDH
activity in the ﬂesh of T100 and T200 treatments increased by
7.9% and 9.0% compared with the control, while the opposite
changes were observed in the columella. During the fruit breaker
stage, ALA treatments signiﬁcantly reduced the MDH activity in the

ﬂesh, which was 21.6% (T100) and 38.0% (T200) lower than that of
the control, respectively. During the maturity stage, ALA treatments
also signiﬁcantly reduced the MDH activity in the ﬂesh. These
results indicated that exogenous ALA could reduce MDH activity,
reduce the content of malic acid, and have a greater effect on
ﬂesh tissue.
At mature green stage, T200 treatment signiﬁcantly increased
PEPC activity in ﬂesh, columella and septum, which was 20.6%,
12.0% and 19.8% higher than that of the control. During the breaker
stage, ALA treatments continued to increase the PEPC activity in
the ﬂesh and columella. In contrast, ALA treatments signiﬁcantly
decreased PEPC activity in septum. At the maturity stage, higher
PEPC activity was formed in theﬂesh and columella under ALA
treatment, and the septum was lower (Figure 7C).
The activity of CS decreased at breaker stage and increased
again at maturity stage in fruit (Figure 7D). At mature green stage,
T100 and T200 treatments signiﬁcantly increased CS activity by
26.8% and 24.6% inﬂesh, by 11.0% and 14.8% in columella, and by
25.5% and 23.3% in septum. At the maturity stage, ALA treatments
increased CS activity inﬂesh, and exerted a signiﬁcant impact on CS
activity in both columella and septum. Notably, CS activity
exhibited a high expression level in theﬂesh.

ACO activity gradually decreased with fruit ripening, and had
the high activity at the mature green stage (Figure 7E). At this stage,
there was a high-throughput citric acid synthesis and
transformation process. ALA treatments inhibited ACO activity at
mature green stage. At maturity stage, ACO activity decreased
signiﬁcantly under T200 treatment inﬂesh and septum, and there
was no change in columella, which resulted in the decrease of citric
acid content at maturity stage.
We studied the relative expression levels of ﬁve key genes
involved in the acid metabolism pathway ( Figure 8 ). At the
mature green stage, compared with the control fruit, ALA
treatments signiﬁcantly up-regulated the expression of SlME1 in
various tissues of the fruit (Figure 8A). During the breaker stage,
ALA treatments increased the expression level of SlME1 in the
septum. At the maturity stage, T100 treatment signi ﬁcantly
increased the expression of SlME1 in the ﬂesh, columella and
septum, which were 2.72, 2.41 and 2.17 times higher than those
of the control, respectively. As shown in theFigure 8B, at the mature
green stage, ALA treatments signiﬁcantly increased the expression
level ofSlmMDH1 in theﬂesh and decreased the expression level of
SlmMDH1 in the columella and septum. During the breaker period,
ALA treatments signiﬁcantly down-regulated the expression of
SlmMDH1 in ﬂesh and columella, and T200 treatment
signiﬁcantly increased the expression of SlmMDH1 in septum,
which was 2.37 times higher than that of the control. At the
maturity stage, ALA treatments signiﬁcantly down-regulated the
expression of SlmMDH1 in the ﬂesh. Besides, ALA treatments
increased the expression level ofSlPPC2 in each stage ﬂesh and
septum, and decreased the expression level ofSlPPC2 in the septum
at the breaker and maturity stages (Figure 8C). In addition, the
application of ALA notably up-regulated the expression ofSlCS in
various fruit tissues during the mature green stage. At maturity

stage, T200 treatment signiﬁcantly up-regulated the expression of
SlCS in ﬂesh (Figure 8D). ALA treatments signiﬁcantly down-
regulated the expression ofSlACO in various tissues at the mature
green stage and the maturity stage. At the breaker stage, ALA
treatments signiﬁcantly increased the expression level ofSlACO in
the columella and septum (Figure 8E).
3.7 Volatile quality of tomato fruit was
promoted by exogenous ALA
In this study we identiﬁed a total of 114 distinct volatiles in
mature tomato fruits (Table 2). These volatiles were categorized
into seven groups: hydrocarbons (7 to 19 types), aldehydes (17 to 23
types), alcohols (11 types), esters (5 types), ketones (10 to 11 types),
phenols (5 to 8 types), and other substances (3 to 8 types). The
application of exogenous ALA treatments resulted in a signiﬁcant
increase in both the total number and mass fraction of volatile
substances. The number of CK species was 69, while T100 and T200
treatments had 81 and 68 species respectively. Regarding the total
mass fraction, T100 (5489.75mgk g-1) and T200 (4398.39mgk g-1)
showed higher values than CK (3232.47mgk g-1), with T100 being
0.7 times and T200 being 0.36 times of CK. The highest content in
ALA treatments was trans-2-hexenal, which was not detected in CK
treatment. The highest content in CK treatment was 2-cyclohexen-
1-ol, which was also not detected in ALA treatments. There were 29
common volatile compounds detected in the three treatments,
accounting for 24.58% of the total (Figure 9).
Different concentrations of ALA treatment could increase the
number and content of various volatile substances to varying
degrees ( Figure 10 ). Among them, T100 treatment could
signiﬁcantly increase the number and content of hydrocarbons
and aldehydes volatile substances compared with the control, and
T200 signiﬁcantly increased the number and content of aldehydes
volatile substances. The characteristic volatile substances identiﬁed
in tomato fruit in this study was presented inTable 3. A total of
eight characteristic volatile substances were identiﬁed across the
three treatments, namely 6-Methyl-5-hepten-2-one, 1-Penten-3-
one, b-Ionone, 1-(2,6,6-Trimethyl-1,3-cyclohexadien-1-yl)-2-
buten-1-one, 3-Hexenal, (E)- 2-Hexenal, Hexanal and Methyl
salicylate. According to the aroma types, it could be divided into
irritating, ﬂoral, fruity and green aroma types. ALA treatments

4 Discussion
Soluble sugars, organic acids, and volatile components play a
signiﬁcant role in determining theﬂavor quality of fruits (Jin et al.,
2023). Previous studies have show nt h a ti np e a c hf r u i t ,t h e
application of exogenous ALA can enhance the fruit ’ss o l u b l e
sugar content and sugar acid ratio (Ye et al., 2017). In our study,
we found that the application of exogenous ALA signi ﬁcantly
increased the content of sugar components and total soluble
sugar in various tissues of tomato fruit, particularly in theﬂesh
and septum tissues. Among the three tissues, glucose and fructose
had the highest content, while sucrose had the lowest content,
which aligns with theﬁndings reported in the research on Tamarillo
(Hu et al., 2023). Sucrose hydrolysis plays a crucial role in fruit
development, involving various enzymes and genes. This process
alters the composition of soluble sugars, consequently affecting the

sweetness of fruits (Hou et al., 2020; Dou et al., 2022). Sucrose can
be converted into fructose and UDP-glucose by SS, or fructose and
glucose by AI and NI. SPS and SS can catalyze fructose and fructose-
6-phosphatase (F-6-P) to synthesize sucrose, respectively (Hongxia
et al., 2022; Varucha et al., 2022). Li et al. (Li et al., 2021) observed a
positive correlation between the expression ofSS and the sugar-acid
ratio of tomato fruit. Up-regulation ofSS expression contributed to
the accumulation of glucose and fructose in the fruit. By silencing
INVINH1 (the inhibitor of the acid invertase gene Lin5), Jin et al.
(Jin et al., 2009) found that tomato invertase activity could be
increased, leading to an increase in fruit hexose content. Similarly,
Wang et al. (Wang B, et al., 2021) obtained similar results by
knocking out INVINH1 in tomato, providing evidence that
invertase is a key enzyme in sucrose metabolism. Zhang et al.
(Zhang et al., 2022 ) discovered that overexpression of SlSPS
signiﬁcantly increased SPS activity, promoting sucrose synthesis
and increasing sucrose content. Conversely, knockout of SlSPS
showed the opposite results. In our study, we observed higher
activities of AI and NI in different tissues of tomato fruits treated
with exogenous ALA compared to the control group at both the
mature green stage and breaker stage. Additionally, the ALA
treatments signiﬁcantly up-regulated the expression of SlAI and
SlNI, enhanced the activity of SS-C inﬂesh, increased the expression
level ofSlSS in ﬂesh, and decreased the activity of SPS inﬂesh. These
changes resulted in a signi ﬁcant accumulation of fructose and
glucose in theﬂesh. Previous studies have indicated that sucrose-
accumulating cherry tomatoes exhibit higher levels of SS in the early
stages of fruit development, suggesting that SS played a crucial role
in the hydrolysis of sucrose during the early stages (Sun et al., 2022).
In our study, we observed a decrease in the activity of SS-C in the
fruit septum when treated with exogenous ALA during the breaker
stage of tomato. Furthermore, the activity of SPS and the expression
level ofSlSPS decreased in both theﬂesh and septum, indicating a
reduction in sucrose synthesis in these tissues. Interestingly, the
sucrose content actually increased under ALA treatment during this
stage, suggesting a potential link to sucrose transport (Ma et al.,
2017; Durá n-Soria et al., 2020). Moreover, we found that the activity
of AI increased treated with exogenous ALA in the pulp, columella,
and septum during the tomato maturity stage. It also up-regulated
the expression of SlAI, leading to higher levels of glucose and
fructose. Additionally, the activity of NI, SS-C, and SPS decreased,
along with the expression ofSlNI, SlSS, and SlSPS, resulting in a
decrease in sucrose content. The decrease in NI and SS-C activity at
this stage suggests that sucrose decomposition relied on AI. These
ﬁndings align with previous research on cherry tomatoes, where
exogenous auxin treatment inhibited ethylene production, SPS, and
sucrose synthase (SUS) activity, down-regulated the expression of
SPS1, SPS4, and SUS3, enhanced AI activity, decreased sucrose
content, and increased fructose and glucose content ( Tao
et al., 2022).
Organic acids, as the primary carbon metabolism intermediates
in plants, play a crucial role in inﬂuencing the taste and sensory
quality of fruits (Liu R, et al., 2016). Previous studies have indicated
variations in the content of organic acid components across
different tissues of tomatoes. The chamber tissue predominantly
contained a higher content of organic acid components compared
to theﬂesh (Mounet et al., 2009). In our study, the accumulation of
acids inﬂesh tissue was the least, except for quinic acid and malic
acid, while it was the highest in columella tissue. Among the organic
acids, citric acid was found to be the most abundant in tomato
fruits, followed by malic acid, which was consistent with the results
of previous transcriptome analysis of tomato fruits (Li et al., 2021).
Additionally, our study showed that the application of exogenous
ALA signiﬁcantly reduced the contents of citric acid, quinic acid,
shikimic acid, and oxalic acid in mature tomato fruits. Thisﬁnding
was consistent with the results reported by Wang et al. (Wang et al.,
2022), suggesting that exogenous ALA spraying has a positive
impact on the metabolism of organic acids in fruits. However, the
accumulation and metabolism of organic acids in fruits involve a
complex physiological and biochemical process. This process is
regulated, synthesized, transported, and decomposed by various
enzymes and genes (Quinet et al., 2019). Liao et al. (Liao et al., 2022)
conducted a transcriptome analysis and discovered that PEPC,
MDH, ME, CS, IDH, and ACO are involved in organic acid
metabolism in litchi. The expression ofPEPC and ACO aligned
with the changed in citric acid content, while the expression of
MDH correlates with the changes in malic acid content. In
Arabidopsis thaliana, the highly expressed genesPPC1 and PPC2

were found to encode PEPC. When PPC1/PPC2 double mutants
were created, a decrease in PEPC activity and a weakening of malic
acid and citric acid synthesis were observed (Shi et al., 2015). Carine
Guillet et al. ( Guillet et al., 2002 )s p e c iﬁcally identiﬁed PPC2
expression in tomato fruit. Increased PPC2 activity leads to an
increase in PEPC activity as well as the content of malic acid and
citric acid. Jia et al. (Jia et al., 2023) discovered that kiwifruit
increased the activity of CS and MDH, up-regulated the
expression of AeCS2 and AsMDH2, and accumulated citric acid
and malic acid. In our study, ALA treatments enhanced the activity
of CS and PEPC, up-regulatedSlCS and SlPPC2 expression, reduced
ACO activity, and up-regulatedSlACO expression, thus promoting
the accumulation of citric acid in different tissues of fruits at mature
green stage. The activity of MDH was enhanced by ALA treatment,
leading to an increase in the expression ofSlMDH1 and a signiﬁcant
rise in malic acid content in theﬂesh during at mature green stage.
This ﬁnding was consistent with the study conducted by Yao et al.
(Yao et al., 2011). The content of malic acid showed a positive
correlation with MDH andSlMDH during the early developmental
stage of tomato. During the breaker stage, due to the enhanced
activity of ME, the expression level ofSlME1 increased, the malic
acid was decarboxylated to pyruvate, causing a sharp decrease in the
content of malic acid. In addition, PEPC activity and SlPPC2
expression level increased under ALA treatment. This could be
attributed to the conversion of PEP to oxaloacetate catalyzed by
PEPC in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, which was also associated with
the substrate of malate metabolism (Liu R, et al., 2016). In this
study, ALA treatment increased the activity of PEPC and CS in
various tissues. It also up-regulated the expression ofSlPPC2 and
SlCS, while decreasing the activity of ACO and down-regulating the
expression ofSlACO. As a result, there was a decrease in the content
of citric acid. Theﬁndings suggest that ALA may decrease the citric
acid content in fruit by inhibiting ACO activity and reducingSlACO
expression, thereby weakening the citric acid synthesis pathway.
This was in line with theﬁndings of Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2007).
Additionally, it was possible that treating the fruit with exogenous

ALA slowed down the TCA cycle during the maturity, leading to a
lower citric acid content compared to the control group. Quinet
et al. (Quinet et al., 2019) suggested that high levels of citric acid can
inhibit ACO activity, thereby slowing down the TCA cycle. Other
studies have indicated that ACO activity has minimal effect on citric
acid content, with the main role being played by isocitrate
dehydrogenase (IDH) (Tang et al., 2010). Whether this holds true
in the current study requires further veriﬁcation.
As one of the important sensory quality components of tomato
fruit, aroma also affects consumers' choice of goods (Wu Q, et al., 2018).
Volatile substances that could be classiﬁed into two states: free and
bound in tomatoes. Free volatile substances could be detected by the
human body, affecting the taste perception of acidity and sweetness
(Goff and Klee, 2006). Bound volatile substances in tomatoes were
present in the form of glycoside-bound compounds, such as trans-2-
hexenal,a-ionone, guaiacol, and methyl salicylate, which were linked to
pyranose througha-glycosidic bonds or bonded to diglycosides (Ortiz-
Serrano and Gil, 2007). At present, there have been a lot of studies on
the important volatile componentsand synthesis pathways in tomato
fruits. It mainly originated from fattyacids, carotenoids, phenylalanine
and branched-chain amino acids (Rodrigues Magalhães et al., 2023). In
our study, a total of 114 volatile substances were detected, of which 69,
81 and 68 were detected in the control, T100 and T200, respectively.
ALA treatments signi ﬁcantly increased the content of volatile
substances in tomato fruit. There are 16 kinds of substances that had
important contributions to the aroma in tomato fruits, which were cis-
3-hexenal, hexanal, trans-2-hexenal,3-methylbutanal,2-methylbutanal,
trans-2-heptenal, 2-phenylacetaldehyde,b-ionone, b-damascenone, 1-
penten-3-one, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, cis-3-hexenol, 2-
phenylethanol, 3-methylbutanol, 2-isobutylthiazole, 1-nitro-2-
ethylbenzene and methyl salicylate (Wang et al., 2015). In our study,
we identiﬁed a total of eight characteristic volatile compounds: seven in
the control group,ﬁve in the T100 group, and seven in the T200 group.
Importantly, treatment with ALA signi ﬁcantly increased the
concentration of these characteristic volatile compounds. The highest
content was trans-2-hexenal, which was not detected in the control
treatment. The highest content in the control was 2-cyclohexen-1-ol,
and the content of cis-3-hexenal in the control treatment was higher
than that in the T200 treatment. It was found that trans-2-hexenal was
isomerized from cis-3-hexenal (Quinet et al., 2019). It has been reported
that lipoxygenase C (TomloxC) and hydroperoxide lyase (HPL)
catalyze linoleic acid or linolenic acid to form hexanal and cis-3-
hexenal (Yilmaz et al., 2001). We considered that that ALA treatment
increased the related enzymatic reaction in this process, increased the
content of trans-2-hexenal and decreased the content of cis-3-hexenal.
Chen et al. (Chen et al., 2022) found that (E) -2-hexenal isomerase (HI)
could catalyze the conversion of (Z) -3-hexenal to (E) -2-hexenal. The
content of 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, geranylacetone,b-ionone andb-
damascenone, which are derived from carotenoids and give tomato
fruitﬂavor and aromaticﬂavor, increased under ALA treatment, which
may be ALA as a prerequisite for plant pigment synthesis. The
accumulation of carotenoids in tomato fruit increases the content of
aromatic substances based on it, which is consistent with the previous
research results (Wang J, et al., 2021). Ortiz-Serrano et al. (Ortiz-
Serrano and Gil, 2009) proposed that 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one was a
glycoside-bound volatileﬂavor substance, and its content increases with
tomato ripening. Methyl salicylate and guaiacol were two types of
substances that were catalyzed by phenylalanine through phenylalanine
ammonia lyase (PAL) to form anti-cinnamic acid. It was produced by
the action of salicylic acid methyl transferase 1 (SlSAMT1) and
catechol-O-methyl transferase 1 (CTOMT1) encoded bySlSAMT1
and CTOMT1 genes respectively (Rambla et al., 2014; Hilton et al.,
2021). Mageroy et al. (Mageroy et al., 2011)f o u n dt h a tCTOMT1
overexpression could increase the content of guaiacol. In this study, the
content of methyl salicylate in the control fruit was higher than that in
the ALA treatment, and the guaiacol with medicinalﬂavor was only
detected in the control and T200 treatment. The content of guaiacol in
the control fruit was 2.3 times that in the T200 treatment fruit.
In summary, the application of 200 mg L-1 ALA solution at
tomato fruit setting stage could signiﬁcantly increase the content
and type of aldehyde volatile substances in fruits. In addition, ALA
treatments could signiﬁcantly increase the accumulation of sugars
in fruit ﬂesh and septum tissues by regulating the activity of key
enzymes and the expression of key genes in sugar and acid
metabolism during fruit development, reduce the content of
organic acids in various tissues, increase the ratio of sugar to acid
in fruit, and improve the sugar and acid quality of tomato
fruit (Figure 11).
