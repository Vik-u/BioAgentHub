Abstract
Objective: The objective of this study was to assess liver functions in tuberculosis patients after
6 months of treatment and determine the difference in the level of liver enzymes based on
medication adherence and patient characteristics.
Methods: We used a prospective cohort design. The inclusion criteria were adult tuberculosis
patients treated with the first line of antituberculosis drugs. The patients’ adherence to medica-
tion was measured using the Medication Adherence Rate Scale questionnaire. We also measured
the total bilirubin, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase levels over 2, 4, and
6 months of treatment.
Results: There were 233 tuberculosis patients enrolled in this study, with 58.91% male patients
and the mean age of 40.31 (SD: 18.00) years. Overall, 86.3% of the patients had good medication
adherence. The patients reported increased levels of aspartate aminotransferase (40%) and ala-
nine aminotransferase (64%). There were no significant differences in total bilirubin between the
adherence groups. T uberculosis patients with poor adherence showed significantly increased
levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels (p <0.05). Female

patients with poor adherence had high levels of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate
aminotransferase.
Conclusion: The monitoring of alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase in
tuberculosis patients should be implemented during the 2nd, 4th, and 6th months of treatment,
especially in female patients.

Introduction
In 2020, Indonesia showed the second high-
est level of tuberculosis (TB) burden world-
wide. TB has a significant impact on the
medical, social, cultural, and economic
growth in Indonesia.1 The incidence of TB
in Indonesia has increased from 339 in 2021
to 385 in 2022. 2 Approximately 845,000
people in Indonesia fell ill due to TB in
2020; 24,000 people fell ill due to drug-
resistant TB in 2018; and 98,300 died of
TB in 2018.
1
Poor adherence is one of the complex
problems related to TB in Indonesia. A pre-
vious study stated that lack of information
about the expected adverse effects of medi-
cation may lead to poor medication adher-
ence in TB patients.
3 In China, more than
50% of TB patients were categorized as
having good adherence. A study stated
that some sociodemographic characteris-
tics, treatment factors, knowledge about
TB, mental health, and behavioral charac-
teristics may influence TB patients’ medica-
tion adherence.
4 Our previous study in
Indonesia showed that patients with good
knowledge about TB experienced a less
severe impact of hepatotoxicity and had
good medication adherence.5 In Ethiopia,
the incidence of hepatotoxicity reached
7.9%, and factors such as comorbidity
and older age had significant association
with drug-induced hepatotoxicity.
6
Monitoring liver enzyme abnormalities is
critically important in TB treatment due to
the potential risk of drug-induced liver
injury (DILI). Early detection of elevated
liver enzymes allows timely interventions,
such as dose adjustment or substitution
with less hepatotoxic drugs, thereby pre-
venting the progression of liver injury.
Studies have emphasized that regular liver
function monitoring is crucial in preventing
severe outcomes of DILI, especially because
symptoms of liver injury can be subtle and
progression remains undetected in some
patients.
7 Patients with elevated liver
enzymes are at increased risk of developing
serious hepatotoxicity, which can necessita-
te the discontinuation or alteration of the
TB treatment regimen. This may complicate
treatment and lead to the development of
drug resistance if not managed effectively.
Liver enzyme abnormalities may lead to
drug side effects, such as nausea, fatigue,
and jaundice, which can compromise the
patient’s medication adherence.
8
During the coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic, some innovations were launched
to increase medication adherence in TB
patients. A previous study showed that
video directly observed therapy (DOT)
was more effective in verifying the ingestion
2 Journal of International Medical Research
of TB medications. 9 Previous systematic
reviews have shown that early recognition
and appropriate management of adverse
drug reactions (ADRs) during TB treat-
ment may prevent the discontinuation of
TB treatment. The ADRs experienced by
TB patients included gastrointestinal distur-
bances, serious hepatotoxicity, ototoxicity,
nephrotoxicity, and cutaneous ADRs.
10
The objective of this study was to assess
liver functions in TB patients after 6
months of antituberculosis treatment and
determine the difference in the level of
liver enzymes based on medication adher-
ence and patient characteristics.
Methods
This prospective cohort study enrolled
adult TB patients treated with the first
line of antituberculosis drugs (fixed dose
combination) in 35 primary health care
centers including hospitals in the area of
Yogyakarta and Central Java from
February 2021 to February 2022. We select-
ed the patients purposively. The inclusion
criteria were adult TB patients receiving
antituberculosis treatments for 6 months.
Pregnant women and patients with comor-
bidities related to liver function were
excluded. We measured patients’ medica-
tion adherence using the Medication
Adherence Rating Scale (MARS). The
MARS questionnaire has five questions
related to TB medication use. It uses a
Likert scale with five choices: poor adher-
ence is defined by a score of 1, good adher-
ence is defined by a score of 5, and the
gradual options are defined by scores
from 2 to 4.
5 The patients were categorized
as having good or poor adherence using the
total score of MARS questionnaire. The
good adherence group had a total score of
25, and the poor adherence group had a
total score <25. We followed the patients
during the 6 months of treatment.
We collected laboratory results, such as
hemoglobin (Hb), total bilirubin, aspartate
aminotransferase (AST), and alanine ami-
notransferase (ALT) levels, at the 2
nd,4 th,
and 6th months of treatment. We did not
define DILI, but we only defined the eleva-
tion of bilirubin, AST, and ALT when they
were over their upper limits. We considered
the elevation in liver enzymes because we
believe that these findings can be used to
prevent DILI. We did not report the base-
line liver enzyme levels because we had
excluded patients with diagnosis related to
abnormal liver functions. This study was
approved by the Ethical Committee of
Ahmad Dahlan University, Yogyakarta
city, Indonesia (number: 012002010, date:
21 January 2021), located in Jl Prof
Dr Soepomo Jaturan, Yogyakarta. We
obtained written informed consent from
the study patients. We have de-identified
all patient details. We analyzed the data
descriptively to describe the average Hb,
bilirubin, AST, and ALT levels as well as
TB patients with increased levels of biliru-
bin, AST, and ALT. Then, we analyzed the
association between patients’ medication
adherence and Hb, bilirubin, AST, and
ALT levels. We used the Student’s t-test
to assess differences in the liver enzymes
levels between the good and poor adherence
groups at 2, 4, and 6 months of antituber-
culosis treatment, revealing no significant
difference. We found no missing data in
this study. The methods in this study were
conducted in accordance with the Helsinki
Declaration of 1975, as revised in 2013.
The reporting of this study conforms
to the Strengthening the Reporting of
Observational studies in Epidemiology
(STROBE) guidelines.

Results
There were 233 TB patients enrolled in this
study, with 58.91% male patients and the
mean age of 40.31 (SD: 18.00) years.
Perwitasari et al. 3
Overall, 86.26% of them had good medica-
tion adherence. Most of the patients had
the highest education level of elementary
to senior high school (86.26%). Most of
the patients had no comorbidity (76.82%).
The patients’ sociodemographic character-
istics are presented in Table 1.
Table 2 presents the association between
laboratory data and medication adherence
in TB patients at 2, 4, and 6 months. After
6 months of treatment, a significant associ-
ation was observed between patients’ ALT
and AST levels and their medication
adherence (p <0.05 and p <0.02, respec-
tively). Figure 1 shows the elevation in the
patients’ Hb, bilirubin, ALT, and AST
levels after 6 months of treatment. The
level of bilirubin was above the normal
range from 2
nd to 6th months of treatment.
Female TB patients in the poor adher-
ence group exhibited elevated AST and
ALT levels. The differences in ALT and
AST levels between the good and poor
adherence groups were significant at 2, 4,
and 6 months of treatment, with the AST
level of females in the poor adherence group
reaching two times that of the upper limit of
the normal range. However, the ALT level
of females in the poor adherence group
reached 1.5 times that of the upper limit
of the normal range. Significant differences
were observed in the ALT levels of male
patients at 4 and 6 months of treatment.
Figure 2 presents the proportion of TB
patients who showed elevated levels of bil-
irubin, ALT, and AST during the treat-
ment. The levels of bilirubin, ALT, and
AST increased again at the 6
th month of
treatment.
Discussion
This study found that 64% and 40% of TB
patients exhibited elevated ALT and AST
levels, respectively. Although the levels of
ALT and AST decreased in the 2
nd month
of treatment, they increased again in the 6th
month of treatment. Female sex was found
to be a predictor of medication adherence.
Female patients with high levels of ALT
and AST had poor adherence, owing to
treatment discontinuation. Most of the TB
patients in Indonesia are male; among the
total TB patients, 6 million are adult males
and 3.4 million are adult females.
12 Our
study showed that the level of liver enzymes
was significantly different between female
TB patients with good and poor adherence.
Many previous studies have shown that
female TB patients are at increased risk

of developing hepatotoxicity during antitu-
berculosis treatment.13–15 Women and men
metabolize drugs differently, partly due to
hormonal variations and genetic factors.
Women are often considered “slow
acetylators” for drugs such as isoniazid
(INH), which increases the concentration of
hepatotoxic metabolites that can damage the
liver. Women generally have higher levels of
autoimmune responses than men. This
can make them more susceptible to
autoimmune-like reactions triggered by cer-
tain drugs, including antituberculosis medica-
tions, which may contribute to
hepatotoxicity. In addition, women have a
higher body fat percentage, which may alter
drug distribution and elimination. Fat-
soluble drugs or metabolites may be retained
for a longer time in body tissues, leading to a
higher cumulative dose exposure to the
liver and thus an increased risk of
hepatotoxicity.

The ALT and AST levels were elevated
after 2 months of treatment, which
decreased after 4 months and increased
again after 6 months of treatment. A previ-
ous study stated that elevation of liver
enzymes is observed in the early treatment
of TB.
17 Moreover, these levels further
increase during antituberculosis treatment.
During the abovementioned study, there
were no dose adjustment procedures. This
is because during usual care, no dose
adjustments are performed for the elevation
of liver enzymes. The liver enzymes were
closely monitored.
17 The physician moni-
tored the liver function of patients who
exhibited elevated liver enzymes.
INH is the most common drug related to
DILI. The risk of DILI increases owing to
the combined use of INH and pyrazina-
mide. INH is metabolized into hepatotoxic-
ity intermediate metabolites. The direct
hydrolysis of INH also results in potent
hepatotoxicity.
5,10 The pharmacogenomic
role of INH in DILI has shown that some
genes play a significant role in liver dys-
function.
18 Serum INH levels of>7 mg/mL
posed a higher risk of DILI in patients in
Indonesia. TB patients with slow acetylator
also had a higher risk of DILI than those
with rapid acetylator.
18 NAT-2 and HLA
showed a significant association with
DILI in Indonesian patients.19 This associ-
ation between DILI and gene polymor-
phism has been observed in other
countries in addition to Indonesia.
20–22
Rifampicin and pyrazinamide may also ele-
vate liver enzymes. The underlying mecha-
nism remains unclear; however, a study
mentioned that superoxide generation can
induce the hepatotoxic effects of antitube-
culosis treatment.
23
Our study findings are supported by
those of other previous studies, which
revealed that age, sex, and other factors
are common predictors of medication
adherence in TB.
24 Contradictory results
can be seen in the study by Chung et al.
(2025), which mentioned that age, sex, and
other sociodemographic characteristics did
not influence medication adherence during
the 9 months of treatment. Patients who
experienced hepatotoxicity decided to dis-
continue the treatment.25
Other factors related to adherence
were patient-centered factors, perceptions,
beliefs, lifestyle, treatment and side effect
information, patient satisfaction, and
comorbidities.
26 Forgetfulness and inade-
quate knowledge about TB were two
major patient-centered factors that could
influence TB patients’ medication adher-
ence. DOT and health promotion are
patient-centered solutions to resolve this
issue.
26,27 Removal of stigma and discrimi-
nation is important to support TB patients
from the perspective of social aspects.
28 As
Indonesia is famous as a country with thou-
sands of islands, transportation and dis-
tance from public health centers remains a
problem in Indonesia. Thus, DOT is man-
datory for TB patients in Indonesia and
may overcome the geographic problem in
Indonesia. The government must think
about the facilities and transportation that
are affordable for TB patients.
29
Most TB patients are associated with
poverty and have low education levels. 6
This study did not find any significant dif-
ference between the highest education level
and medication adherence. However, the
researcher found that most TB patients in
Indonesia resided in houses with poor sani-
tation and less sunlight. Furthermore, these
individuals graduated from elementary,
junior high school, or senior high school.
The Indonesian government has already
shared many education leaflets on various
topics, including TB. The Indonesian
Ministry of Health has published reports
on the role of pharmacists in the TB elimi-
nation program. Of these, important roles
include providing motivation for medication
adherence to TB patients; facilitating detec-
tion of TB; monitoring patients’ adherence;
Perwitasari et al. 7
and preventing TB resistance, TB relapse,
and death due to TB.30 Pharmacists play a
crucial role in improving medication adher-
ence among TB patients. Until now, phar-
macists in primary health care centers only
had the responsibility of monitoring the
drug management cycle, including oral anti-
tuberculosis treatment. The interaction
between pharmacists and TB patients in pri-
mary health care centers is very limited. In
the future, pharmacists must take responsi-
bility for health promotion, information dis-
semination, and education on medication
effectiveness and/or ADR monitoring. This
activity will help improve medication adher-
ence among TB patients and minimize the
spread of TB by lowering the rates of
TB treatment discontinuation. This respon-
sibility must be taken up by pharmacists
in collaboration with other health
professionals.
31,32
The limitations of this study are related
to the factors that could be predictors of
medication adherence in TB patients. We
did not collect data regarding lifestyle,
nutrition, and perceived end-beliefs, which
could be the predictors of medication
adherence, because of the COVID-19 pan-
demic. All TB patients in Indonesia follow
the same pattern of TB care because of the
existence of a national standard operating
procedure, ensuring that the interaction
between patients and healthcare providers
would not influence the analysis. These
data are part of the precision medicine
model, which should be integrated with
genomic, medication adherence, and other
psychosocial aspects. We suggest that
future studies must include predictors such
as economic constraints, poor quality of
healthcare providers, poor quality of
healthcare services, patient satisfaction,
being busy with work, level of health infor-
mation/education, pill burden, stigma, and
discrimination. The interpretation of the
present study results is limited to the
location where the study was performed—
Yogyakarta and Central Java.
Conclusion
The 6-month antituberculosis treatment led
to elevated ALT and AST levels. These
levels were significantly different between
the good and poor adherence groups at 2,
4, and 6 months of TB treatment in female
TB patients. The levels of ALT and AST
were significantly higher in females with
poor medication adherence. Female sex
was found to be a predictor of medication
adherence in TB patients, considering the
elevation in the levels of liver enzymes.
