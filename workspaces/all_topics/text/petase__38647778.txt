Abstract 
The escalating crisis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) microplastic contamination in biological wastewater treat-
ment systems is a pressing environmental concern. These microplastics inevitably accumulate in sewage sludge due 
to the absence of effective removal technologies. Addressing this urgent issue, this study introduces a novel approach 
using DuraPETase, a potent enzyme with enhanced PET hydrolytic activity at ambient temperatures. Remarkably, 
this enzyme was successfully secreted from Comamonas testosteroni CNB-1, a dominant species in the active sludge. 
The secreted DuraPETase showed significant hydrolytic activity toward p-NPB and PET nanoplastics. Furthermore, 
the CNB-1 derived whole-cell biocatalyst was able to depolymerize PET microplastics under ambient temperature, 
achieving a degradation efficiency of 9% within 7 days. The CNB-1-based whole biocatalysts were also capable 
of utilizing PET degradation intermediates, such as terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG), and bis(2-
hydroxyethyl)-TPA (BHET), for growth. This indicates that it can completely mineralize PET, as opposed to merely 
breaking it down into smaller molecules. This research highlights the potential of activated sludge as a potent source 
for insitu microplastic removal.

Introduction
Plastics have revolutionized modern life, but the accumu-
lation of synthetic polymers in landfills and the environ -
ment has created a global pollution crisis (Xu et al. 2023). 
Additionally, there has been increasing research interest 
in the potential adverse effects of microplastics (ranging 
from 1  μm to 5  mm) on ecosystems and human health 
(Wei et  al. 2019). Microplastics are produced through 
the weathering and mechanical tearing (such as tires) of 
larger pieces of plastic, and are also directly manufac -
tured and utilized in many personal care and cosmetic 
products (PCCPs) (Nizzetto et  al. 2016; van der Laan 
et  al. 2023). Furthermore, microplastics are transported 
from raw wastewater to wastewater treatment plants 
(WWTPs) (Browne et al. 2013; Sun et al. 2020), WWTPs 
can efficient remove over 90% of microplastics from raw 
wastewater (Carr et al. 2016). However, duo to this high 
removal efficiency, most microplastics end up being 
retained in the sewage sludge (Mahon et al. 2017; Zhang 
et al. 2020b).
Microplastics are often highly resistant to microbial 
degradation due to their chemically inert backbone 
structure (Chen et  al. 2022; Thakur et  al. 2023). Con -
sequently, the fast release of microplastics, coupled 
with their strong resistance to degradation, leads to 
the rapid accumulation of these particles in the sew -
age sludge. Studies have indicated that concentrations 
of microplastics in the sludge samples ranged from 
1.6–56.4 ×  103 particles per kilogram of dry sludge (Li 
et al. 2018). This microplastic-rich sludge is often fur -
ther processed either as landfilled or used as farmland 
fertilizer and can re-enter the water system through soil 
erosion or surface runoff (Nizzetto et al. 2016). Despite 
the application of various treatments, such as aerobic 
digestion and industrial composting, to remove harm -
ful substances from sludge before agriculture applica -
tions (Mahon et al. 2017), current technologies remain 
inadequate for the complete elimination of microplas -
tics (Li et  al. 2022; Mahon et  al. 2017). Therefore, the 
development of efficient and environmentally friendly 
methods, such as in  situ microbial degradation of 
microplastics in WWTPs and sludge, is of great impor -
tance in preventing further migration of microplastics 
into the environment.
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polystyrene (PS), polypropyl -
ene (PP), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) are the 
most common microplastics found in sludges (Rochman 
et al. 2013). Among them, the biodegradation of PET into 
monomers is has been proven feasible (Xu et  al. 2023). 
An extraordinary finding was the discovery of the bac -
terium Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6, in which Is PETase 
and MHETase were biochemically characterized to work 
together to degrade low-crystalline PET into monomers 
(Knott et al. 2020; Yoshida et al. 2016). As other success -
ful polyester hydrolase examples, leaf and branch com -
post cutinase (LCC), Thermobifida fusca cutinase (TfH), 
and recently discovered PE-H, PHL-7, MG8 were also 
found from different microorganisms or metagenomic 
DNA extracts (Dong et al. 2020; Xu et al. 2023). A promi-
nent example is DuraPETase (Cui et al. 2021), which was 
obtained after the mutation of ten amino acids in wild-
type IsPETase (Cui et al. 2021). The catalysis mechanism 
of DuraPETase involves the hydrolysis of the ester bond 
within the PET molecule (Cui et al. 2021). Compared to 
the wild-type Is PETase, DuraPETase showed over 300-
fold higher hydrolytic activity against PET powder (Cui 
et  al. 2021). These PET hydrolases have inspired the 
development of functional PET degrading strains for

in situ degradation of PET microplastics within the acti -
vated sludge system.
Comamonadaceae is a dominant species in the acti -
vated sludge system, comprising more than 2% of the 
total abundance of sludge microorganisms (Wu et  al. 
2019; Zhang et  al. 2020a). Additionally, studies have 
reported that Comamonas can degrade terephthalic acid 
(TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG), which are the main prod-
ucts of PET depolymerization (Aksu et al. 2021; Dierkes 
Robert et al. 2022; Hosaka et al. 2013; Ma et al. 2009). The 
objective of this study is to create a whole-cell biocatalyst 
for the degradation of PET microplastics. To achieve this, 
DuraPETase was heterologous expressed and optimized 
in Comamonas testosteroni CNB-1. This strain was iso -
lated from a biological reactor treating wastewater from 
a p-chloronitrobenzene production factory (Liu et  al. 
2007; Wang et  al. 2021). The PET-degrading biocatalyst 
derived from CNB-1 demonstrated significant degrada -
tion activity against  Impranil® DLN and PET nanopar -
ticles. This degradation ability was further confirmed by 
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of PET film 
surfaces after 14  days of degradation. Moreover, in rel -
evance to application scenarios, the capability of CNB-1 
derived PET-degrading biocatalyst to PET microplastics 
was further demonstrated. This study has opened up 
avenues for developing environmentally friendly bio -
catalytic approaches to address microplastic accumula -
tion, and highlights the potential application of CNB-1 
derived PET-degrading biocatalyst in sludge microplastic 
degradation.
Material and methods
Bacterial strains, plasmids, and culture conditions
C. testosteroni CNB-1(CGMCC 1.12282) was cultivated 
and maintained at 30 °C in LB broth or on LB plates with 
1.5% (wt/vol) agar. For PET degradation, a mineral salt 
medium (MSM, pH 7.0) containing  (NH4)2SO4 1  g/L, 
 K2HPO4 6  g/L,  KH2PO4 1  g/L,  MgSO4·7H2O 0.1  g/L, 
NaCl 5  g/L was used by adding PET nanoplastics or 
microplastics. The pET-29a(+) vector served as the back -
bone for expressing enzymes (Is PETase, LCC, and Dura -
PETase) in E. coli BL21(DE3). For the overexpression of 
DuaPETase in CNB-1, the plasmid used was a derivative 
of pBBR1MCS-2 (pBBR1MCS2pfer), with its promoter 
replaced with a strong promoter from C. testosteroni 
CNB-1 (Huang et al. 2019). When necessary, antibiotics 
were added at the following final concentrations: 200 μg/
ml kanamycin for C. testosteroni; 50  μg/ml kanamycin, 
and 100 μg/ml ampicillin for E. coli.
Expression of DuraPETase in C. testosteroni
DuraPETase (Genbank: GAP38373.1), which was 
mutated of 10 amino acid sites (S214H/I168R/W159H/
S188Q/R280A/A180I/G165A/Q119Y/L117F/T140D) in 
the backbone of Is PETase. In this study, the ten mutated 
sites were regenerated in Is PETase and then commer -
cially synthesized with codon optimization for expres -
sion in E. coli cells (GenScript, Nanjing, China). The 
genes were cloned into the pBBR1MCS2pfer vector, a 
pBBR1MCS-2 derivative plasmid whose promoter was 
replaced with a strong promoter from C. testosteroni, and 
contained a gfp  gene (Huang et  al. 2019). DuraPETase 
was inserted before the gfp  gene to help further evaluate 
the expression via GFP intensity. To help the secretion 
of DuraPETase, an endogenic secreted signaling peptide 
OmpC (from CNB-1, gene locus: CtCNB1_1477) was 
tagged before DuraPETase, generating the final plasmid, 
pBBRpfer-OmpC-DuraPETase-GFP .
For plasmids transformation, C. testosteroni was pre -
pared for electrocompetent cells by washing twice with 
ice-cold 10% glycerol, and then concentrated 100-fold. 
Electroporation was performed with prechilled 2  mm 
gap electroporation cuvettes (Bio-Rad) and electropo -
rated at 2.5 kV with a Bio-Rad MicroPulser. 1 mL of LB 
was added to shocked cells and recovered for 2 h, before 
plating on LB agar with appropriate antibiotics. The 
green fluorescent signal was measured using the Syn -
ergy H4 Hybrid Reader (BioTek). To determine the total 
GFP intensity, 200 μL of overnight culture was collected 
in a 96-well plate for recording. The extracellular GFP 
was subsequently measured from the supernatant after 
centrifugation.
Extracellular hydrolase activity measurement 
by p‑nitrophenyl butyrate (p‑NPB) assay
The hydrolase activity of CNB-1/pDuraPETase was eval -
uated using p-NPB (Sigma-Aldrich N9876) as a model 
substrate with certain modifications. CNB-1/pDura -
PETase was incubated in MSM medium containing 5% 
(v/v) LB for 3 days at 30 °C under aerobic conditions, cells 
were harvested by centrifugation at 7000g for 2 min, and 
the supernatant was used for measurement of the extra -
cellular hydrolase activity. Absorbance assays were car -
ried out on the Tecan plate reader, using 200 μL reactions 
composed of 20  μL supernatant and 10  μL 1  M p-NPB 
in Tris buffer (pH 8.0) (Ateşlier and Metin 2006; Qiao 
et al. 2022). The production of p-nitrophenol (p-NP) was 
monitored at 405 nm within 30 min at 30 °C. One unit of 
activity (1 U) was defined as the enzymatic production of 
1 μmol p-NP per min at 30 °C.
HPLC analysis of the degradation product of PET
HPLC was performed on an Agilent 1260 HPLC System 
using a C18 Reversed-phase column (4.6 mm × 250 mm, 
Agilent Technologies). The mobile phase was metha -
nol/18  mM phosphate buffer (pH 2.5) at a flow rate of 
Page 4 of 10Cao et al. Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2023) 10:94 
0.5 mL  min−1, and the effluent was monitored at a wave -
length of 240  nm. The typical elution conditions were 
as follows: 0 to 30  min, 25% (v/v) methanol, and 30 to 
50 min, 25–100% methanol linear gradient. 10 μL of the 
final degradation products was used for detection.
Standard mono(2-hydroxyethyl)-TPA (MHET) was 
obtained from the complete hydrolysis using LCC of 
bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-TPA (BHET). After the complete 
hydrolysis of BHET to MHET was confirmed by HPLC, 
the protein removed from the reaction mixture with 
Amicon Ultra 10  kDa (Merck Millipore). Then, MHET, 
TPA, and BHET of different concentrations were used 
to run HPLC, and the standard curves of the three were 
drawn according to the relationship between peak area 
and sample loading.
Thermogravimetric analysis for PET nanoplastics
PET nanoplastics were produced as previously described 
with slight modifications (Wei et al. 2014). Briefly, 0.1 g of 
PET films with an initial crystallinity of approximately 4% 
was dissolved in 10 mL 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexafluoro-2-propanol 
(HFIP) at room temperature for at least 12 h. This solu -
tion was dropped into 100 mL ultra-filtered water while 
stirring thoroughly at 10,000 rpm using an overhead stir -
rer. Precipitated PET formed small particles, which can 
preserve as stable aqueous suspension whereas the larger 
aggregates were removed with a standard folded filter. 
The organic solvent was then removed from the particle 
suspension using a rotary evaporator. For PET nanoplas -
tics degradation, bacteria were grown in LB overnight 
and then inoculated by 100-times dilution into 50  mL 
fresh MSM media, and 15 mL of the prepared PET nano -
plastics was added for incubation at 30 °C for 10 days.
Thermogravimetric analysis was used to determine the 
degradation of PET nanoplastics by CNB-1 derived PET-
degrading biocatalyst. The experiments were performed 
on HY4520 Instruments under nitrogen with a heating 
rate of 20 °C/min from room temperature up to 800 °C. 
The mass loss with time and temperature is monitored. 
PET nanoplastics with or without CNB-1 derived PET-
degrading biocatalysts were assessed for their PET nano -
plastic degradation.
PET microplastic degradation and weight loss 
measurement
The amorphous Goodfellow film (crystallinity of 4%) 
(Chen et  al. 2021) was cut into 2 × 2  mm fragments. 
These small fragments were then smashed and passed 
through a 40-mesh sieve to obtain PET microplastic par -
ticles with an average size of approximately 425 μm, and a 
crystallinity around 10%. To prepare the microplastics for 
use in the degradation experiment, the PET microplastics 
were washed twice with 75% ethanol, followed by sterile 
water. 100  mg of the prepared microplastics was added 
into 100 mL for the degradation experiment mixture. In 
parallel, bacteria were grown overnight in LB media, and 
then inoculated by 100-times dilution into fresh MSM 
media containing 5% (v/v) LB, and incubated at 30  °C 
for 7 days. Three technical replicates were performed for 
each strain. To facilitate the efficient removal of biologi -
cal tissues from PET microplastics and achieve accurate 
weight loss measurements after degradation, the PET 
microplastics were treated with a 10% KOH solution and 
subsequently incubated at 60  °C for 24  h. This process 
successfully digested and removed all biological tissues 
present on the PET microplastics.
SEM analysis
At the end of the PET film degradation (14  days), the 
reactions were stopped by adding 5 mL of 3 M HCl. The 
PET pieces in the flasks were used for scanning electron 
microscopy (SEM) analysis by SU-8100 (Hitachi, Japan) 
after washing with 1% SDS, ultrapure water, and ethanol, 
respectively. In SEM analysis, samples were coated with 
Au for 180 s at 20 mA and were scanned under a low vac-
uum at 10 kV.
Results and discussion
DuraPETase is suitable for heterologous expression in C. 
testosteroni CNB‑1
For the heterologous expression of PET hydrolyses in C. 
testosteroni CNB-1, we initially compared the activity of 
several previously reported enzymes including Is PETase, 
DuraPETase, and LCC, at a temperature of 30  °C. This 
selection was made because the optimum growth tem -
perature for the CNB-1 strain is 30  °C, and the typi -
cal wastewater treatment process is also conducted at a 
similar temperature. While all three enzymes exhibited 
PET degradation activity, it has been reported that Dura -
PETase and LCC demonstrate to have good activity at 
temperatures above 60 °C (Cui et al. 2021; Tournier et al. 
2020), whereas IsPETase has relatively low catalysis activ-
ity at 30 °C (Knott et al. 2020).
We first purified the three enzymes and tested their 
activities by observing transparent zones on  Impranil® 
DLN plates (Brott et  al. 2022). After dropping with the 
same amount of enzymes and incubating for 2 h, Dura -
PETase showed a clearer zone than IsPETase and LCC 
(Fig.  1A), indicating that DuraPETase exhibited higher 
catalytic activity at 30  °C. To further confirm this, we 
measured the depolymerization efficacy of the three 
enzymes using PET films (Goodfellow) as a substrate. 
After treating the films with an equal amount of enzymes, 
we monitored the weight loss and the total products 
released from the PET films. The total released prod -
ucts (TPA, MHET, and BHET), determined by HPLC 
Page 5 of 10
Cao et al. Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2023) 10:94 
 
indicated that the highest degradation product release 
was observed for DuraPETase (Fig.  1B), which is about 
1.5 folds than that of LCC, and over 10 times higher than 
that of Is PETase (Fig.  1B). These data also supported 
the weight loss of the PET films (without pretreatment) 
after enzymatic degradation. After 72  hours of enzy -
matic treatment, DuraPETase resulted in a weight loss of 
2.2 mg (Fig. 1C), whereas IsPETase and LCC only showed 
weight losses of 0.4 mg and 1.4 mg, respectively (Fig. 1C). 
Overall, these results indicated that DuraPETase exhib -
ited the highest catalytic activity at 30 °C, and is a suitable 
enzyme for subsequent heterologous expression in C. tes-
tosteroni CNB-1.
Functional expression of DuraPETase enabled PET 
degradation by C. testosteroni CNB‑1
To efficiently degrade PET, the secretion of DuraPETase 
is crucial, as PET is a high molecular weight polymer 
that cannot enter cells. To achieve this, we selected a 
native signal peptide from CNB-1, named OmpC (gene 
locus: CtCNB1_1477), to assist the efficient secretion 
of DuraPETase in CNB-1. OmpC is a frequently used 
signal peptide for efficient secretion of heterologous 
proteins (Zhou et  al. 2018). In addition to extracellular 
secretion, a high level of DuraPETase transcription is 
also essential for PET degradation. To accomplish this, a 
strong constitutive promoter from C. testosteroni CNB-1 
to replace the promoter in the pBBR1MCS-2 plasmid, 
resulting in a new plasmid called pBBR1MCS2pfer was 
used  (Huang et  al. 2019). The signal peptide and the 
DuraPETase gene were inserted into the pBBR1MCS2p -
fer. Then this recombinant plasmid was transformed into 
C. testosteroni, generating the CNB-1B strain. Similarly, 
we also constructed a recombinant strain containing the 
DuraPETase gene with GFP , a strain without the signal 
peptide, and a strain with the original empty plasmid 
(Fig. 2A).
We chose CNB-1C (with  SPOmpC) and CNB-1D (with -
out  SPOmpC) to test the secretion efficiency of the recom -
binant strains. Both of these strains are tagged with 
GFP , and the only difference between them is the sig -
nal peptide. As shown in Fig.  2B, OmpC signal peptides 
 (SPOmpC) successfully direct the secretion of DuraPETase 
(Fig. 2B), resulting in a two-fold increase in GFP intensity 
in the supernatants than the recombinant strain CNB-1D 
(Fig. 2B). Interestingly, even when no signal peptide was 
fused, the strain CNB-1D was still able to export extracel-
lular DuraPETase-GFP , although the GFP intensity was 
much lower than in CNB-1C (Fig.  2B). This could be due 
to the phospholipid hydrolase activity of DuraPETase. 
Phospholipid is an important component of the cell 
membrane, and hydrolysis of phospholipids can enhance 
membrane permeability and release of DuraPETase into 
the extracellular milieu (Su et al. 2013). Similar phenom -
ena have been observed in many PET-degrading cuti -
nases expressed in E. coli in previous studies (Su et  al. 
2013).
Also, CNB-1C generates a higher total GFP than CNB-
1D, indicating that the signal peptide may contribute to 
the expression of DuraPETase (Fig. 2B). This is reasonable 
considering that high concentrations of DuraPETase can 
be toxic  to microbial cells, and a secretion system may 
reduce cytotoxicity and facilitate higher-level expression 
of DuraPETase. Furthermore, when using  Impranil® DLN 
Fig. 1 Comparison of hydrolytic activity was conducted among IsPETase, DuraPETase, and LCC at a temperature of 30 °C. A Transparent zones 
were formed through the incubation of purified enzymes with Impranil® DLN as the substrate. B The release of degrading products from PET 
films after 72 h of incubation with IsPETase, LCC, and DuraPETase at 30 °C was analyzed. The total product release was quantified by summing 
the detected released compounds (TPA, MHET, and BHET). C The weight loss of PET films after incubation with purified enzymes for 72 h, 
with 100 mg PET films being utilized for degradation
Page 6 of 10Cao et al. Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2023) 10:94 
as a substrate, all the recombinant strains showed similar 
transparent zones except CNB-1A, which only contains 
an empty vector (Fig.  2C). This is consistent with the 
extracellular GFP intensity data, as DuraPETase can be 
successfully secreted when no signal peptide was fused. 
Taken together, these data suggested that DuraPETase 
was functionally expressed in C. testosteroni CNB-1, and 
the signal peptide  SPOmpC contributed to the secretion.
Hydrolytic activity of secreted DuraPETase on PET
To investigate whether the DuraPETase secreted by C. 
testosteroni CNB-1 is active against PET, we conducted 
enzymatic analysis using model substrates such as p-
NPB. Although the structure of p-NPB is different from 
PET, it has been reported that the conversion rates of 
small-molecule para-nitrophenyl esters are comparable 
to PET oligomers (Wei et  al. 2022). Therefore, we first 
used p-NPB as a substrate to assess the hydrolytic activity 
of DuraPETase when expressed in CNB-1. As expected, 
CNB-1B and CNB-1C exhibited significant kinetic 
hydrolytic activity against p-NPB compared to the blank 
control CNB-1A, and CNB-1D (Fig.  3A), another recom-
binant strain lacking a secretion signal peptide. Among 
them, CNB-1C showed a little higher hydrolytic activ -
ity than CNB-1B, but the difference was not significant 
(Fig.  3A). Moreover, the SEM images further confirmed 
that CNB-1B can induce surface erosion to PET films 
after a two-week incubation period (Fig. 3C), whereas the 
PET films incubated with the control strain (CNB-1A) 
maintained a smooth surface (Fig.  3B). Consequently, 
we selected the recombinant strain CNB-1B for further 
experiments.
We then investigated the hydrolytic activity of CNB-
1B on PET nanoplastics, which were prepared from 
PET films. These nanoplastics possess a high sur -
face-to-volume ratio, making them significantly more 
susceptible to hydrolysis in comparison to the films 
Fig. 2 Heterogeneous expression of DuraPETase was observed in C. testosteroni CNB-1. A DuraPETase was fused with different signal peptide 
and promoters to facilitate extracellular secretion in CNB-1. Different recombinant plasmids were constructed and introduced into CNB-1 
to generate corresponding strains, which were designated as CNB-1A to CNB-1D, respectively. B The secretion efficiency of DuraPETase 
with or without OmpC signal peptide, was determined by measuring the intensity of extracellular GFP , which was fused with DuraPETase. C The 
hydrolytic activity of the recombinant strains was assessed on  Impranil® DLN plates
Fig. 3 Enzymatic activity analysis was conducted on recombinant 
strains derived from CNB-1. A The catalyst activity of the secreted 
DuraPETase was determined using p-NPB as a substrate. The strains 
were incubated with MSM medium at 30 °C for 3 days, and 1 mL 
of the supernatant was collected for incubation with p-NPB 
at 30 °C for 30 min, and the absorbance at 410 nm was measured. 
SEM images revealed surface erosion of PET films after 14 days 
of degradation by CNB-1A (B) and CNB-1B (C), at 30 °C

(Barth et  al. 2015; Walter et  al. 1995). After incubat -
ing CNB-1B with PET nanoplastics as the sole car -
bon source for 10  days, we use thermogravimetric 
analysis to study the nanoplastics degradation. The 
thermogram in Fig.  4A illustrates the degradation 
of nanoplastics by CNB-1 without the heterologous 
expression of DuraPETase, which shows two stages of 
weight loss (Fig.  4A). Previous publications have sug -
gested that the first stage of weight loss (approximately 
5%) between 25 and 100 °C is caused by the presence 
of water trapped in nanoplastics and bacterial cells. 
The second stage of weight loss, occurring between 
100 and 500 °C, is attributed to the removal of organic 
matter from bacterial cells and most of the PET nan -
oplastics (Fig.  4A). It is important to note that PET 
decomposes above 250  °C, as indicated by previous 
reports (Sorolla-Rosario et  al. 2022). In comparison, 
when the nanoplastics are treated with DuraPETase, 
we observed three distinct stages of weight loss 
(Fig.  4B). The first two stages are consistent with the 
findings mentioned above, but the third stage, occur -
ring from 400 to 700 °C (Fig.  4B), is primarily due to 
the repolymerized of BHET during the heating pro -
cess in the thermogravimetric study. This observation 
aligns with a similar thermogram of BHET reported in 
another study (Scé et al. 2019). These results indicate 
that PET nanoplastics are degraded by DuraPETase, 
resulting in the formation of the intermediate com -

DuraPETase enzyme is capable of hydrolyzing PET.
PET microplastic degradation by CNB‑1 derived whole‑cell 
biocatalyst
Wastewater treatment plants play a significant role in 
the entry of microplastics into the environment (Mur -
phy et  al. 2016; Sun et  al. 2019). It is crucial to develop 
technology that specifically targets and treats microplas -
tics. Microplastics are primarily found in sludge, which 
makes separating them difficult and inefficient (Talvitie 
et al. 2017). Therefore, we have proposed an in situ deg -
radation framework in which engineered C. testosteroni 
CNB-1 is introduced to secrete DuraPETase to hydro -
lyze microplastics (PET films with an initial crystallinity 
of approximately 4%). To this end, we first examined the 
degradation of PET microplastics by the CNB-1 derived 
PET-degrading whole-cell biocatalyst. After incubat -
ing the biocatalysts in MSM medium with 5% (v/v) LB 
for 7  days, we found that the whole-cell biocatalysts 
degraded 9.2 mg of the microplastics, which corresponds 
to a 9% degradation of the total microplastics added 
(Fig.  5B). This result suggests that when DuraPETase is 
secreted, the CNB-1 derived whole-cell biocatalyst is 
capable of degrading PET microplastics.
More importantly, we also found that the CNB-1 
derived PET-degrading whole-cell biocatalyst can uti -
lize main intermediates of enzymatic PET degradation, 
including TPA, EG, and BHET, as sole carbon sources for 
growth (Fig. 5A). While Comamonas is commonly recog-
nized as capable of degrading TPA (Dierkes Robert et al. 
2022; Hosaka et al. 2013), the utilization of EG and BHET 
has not been characterized before. This means that CNB-
1-based whole-cell biocatalyst can completely mineralize 
Fig. 4 Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) was conducted to examine the degradation of PET nanoplastics. The differential scanning calorimetry 
(DSC) and TGA curves of glycolysis products by CNB-1A (A) and CNB-1B (B) are displayed, with the red line representing the DSC curve 
and the black line representing the TGA curve. When PET nanoplastics were degraded by the secreted DuraPETase from CNB-1B, the product BHET 
was released from PET, and the TGA curve showed a distinct BHET polymerization stage, which can be considered as evidence of PET nanoplastics 
degradation by CNB-1 derived whole-cell biocatalyst

the PET microplastics, rather than merely degrading it 
into smaller molecules. In another publication, by func -
tionally immobilizing PETase on the self-assembled E. 
coli curli nanofibers (Zhu et al. 2022), this system could 
depolymerize highly crystalline post-consumer PET 
waste materials under ambient conditions with a deg -
radation efficiency of 9.1% in 7  days (Zhu et  al. 2022), 
which is similar to the degradation efficiency observed in 
this study. Moreover, the whole-cell biocatalyst may have 
better performance in the real-world sewage sludge sys -
tem due to the presence of unlimited nutrients (Zhu et al. 
2022). This would result in the consumption of organic 
matter to express depolymerase to hydrolyze micro -
plastics. Our results suggested the potential of CNB-1 
derived PET-degrading whole-cell biocatalyst for the 
removal of PET microplastics in advanced wastewater 
treatment applications.
With the sludge-indigenous strain C. testosteroni 
CNB-1 as the host, we have proposed an insitu frame -
work for the treatment of sludge microplastics. We have 
designed a novel whole-cell biocatalyst that facilitates 
the degradation of PET microplastics by incorporat -
ing DuraPETase as the key enzyme, thereby allowing for 
the efficient depolymerization of PET into TPA and EG. 
These released intermediates can be further utilized by 
CNB-1 as the sole carbon source. Thus, the PET-degrad -
ing whole-cell biocatalyst derived from CNB-1 opens up 
a promising approach that could potentially lead to the 
complete mineralization of PET microplastics present in 
the sewage sludge. It is worth noting that the microplas -
tic degradation carried out in this study was conducted 
under small-scale lab conditions. To facilitate the practi -
cal application of the PET-degrading whole-cell biocata -
lyst derived from CNB-1, further research is necessary 
to evaluate its performance in the degradation of PET 
microplastics in larger-scale systems such as wastewater 
treatment bioreactors.
Conclusion
In this study, we developed a novel whole-cell biocatalyst 
for the potential removal of microplastics in  situ, using 
sludge-derived C. testosteroni CNB-1. We compared 
the catalytic activity of the reported PET hydrolyses 
(IsPETase, LCC, and DuraPETase) at 30  °C and chose 
DuaPETase for heterologous expression in C. testos -
teroni CNB-1. After optimizing the promoter and signal 
peptide, the DuraPETase was successfully secreted into 
the extracellular milieu from C. testosteroni CNB-1. The 
secretion of DuraPETase led to an efficient hydrolytic 
activity towards PET nanoplastics and microplastics.
