Improvement of whole-cell 
transamination with Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
using metabolic engineering and cell 
pre-adaptation

Abstract 
Background: Whole‑cell biocatalysis based on metabolically active baker’s yeast with engineered transamination 
activity can be used to generate molecules carrying a chiral amine moiety. A prerequisite is though to express effi‑
cient ω‑transaminases and to reach sufficient intracellular precursor levels.
Results: Herein, the efficiency of three different ω‑transaminases originating from Capsicum chinense, Chromo-
bacterium violaceum, and Ochrobactrum anthropi was compared for whole‑cell catalyzed kinetic resolution of race-
mic 1‑phenylethylamine to (R)‑1‑phenylethylamine. The gene from the most promising candidate, C. violaceum 
ω‑transaminase (CV‑TA), was expressed in a strain lacking pyruvate decarboxylase activity, which thereby accumulate 
the co‑substrate pyruvate during glucose assimilation. However, the conversion increased only slightly under the 
applied reaction conditions. In parallel, the effect of increasing the intracellular pyridoxal‑5′‑phosphate (PLP) level 
by omission of thiamine during cultivation was investigated. It was found that without thiamine, PLP supplementa‑
tion was redundant to keep high in vivo transamination activity. Furthermore, higher reaction rates were achieved 
using a strain containing several copies of CV‑TA gene, highlighting the necessity to also increase the intracellular 
transaminase level. At last, this strain was also investigated for asymmetric whole‑cell bioconversion of acetophenone 
to (S)‑1‑phenylethylamine using l‑alanine as amine donor. Although functionality could be demonstrated, the activity 
was extremely low indicating that the native co‑product removal system was unable to drive the reaction towards the 
amine under the applied reaction conditions.
Conclusions: Altogether, our results demonstrate that (R)‑1‑phenylethylamine with >99% ee can be obtained via 
kinetic resolution at concentrations above 25 mM racemic substrate with glucose as sole co‑substrate when combin‑
ing appropriate genetic and process engineering approaches. Furthermore, the engineered yeast strain with highest 
transaminase activity was also shown to be operational as whole‑cell catalyst for the production of (S)‑1‑phenylethyl‑
amine via asymmetric transamination of acetophenone, albeit with very low conversion.

Background
Chiral amines are prevalent functional groups in a wide 
range of bioactive compounds, so efficient, sustainable, 
and economically feasible methods for their synthesis 
are highly desirable [1, 2]. In lieu of chemical catalysis, 
the use of ω-transaminase (ω-TA) (E.C. 2.6.1.18) has 
emerged as a competitive alternative for bio-catalysed 
production of chiral amines, either via asymmetric 
transamination of ketones or via kinetic resolution of 
racemic amines. Asymmetric transamination of prochiral 
ketones to chiral amines can be more advantageous than 
kinetic resolution of racemic substrates since in theory 
all substrate can be converted to the product as opposed 
to a maximum yield of 50% for kinetic resolution. Direct 
conversion of ketones to amines by transamination how
-
ever often suffer from an unfavourable thermodynamic 
reaction equilibrium, which makes the reaction reliant on 
a functional co-product removal system [3]. Biocatalytic 
transamination is most often performed with purified 
enzymes or with cell extracts from recombinant bacteria 
over-expressing the required enzymes [3–5]. Processes 
where ω-TAs are used include for instance the synthesis 
of Sitagliptin, (S)-Rivastigmine, and precursors for the 
synthesis of Pregabalin and Brivaracetam [6–8].
From a process perspective, the use of intact whole 
microbial cells that over-express specific recombinant 
ω-TAs may be advantageous, since it offers a more sim
-
ple overall process configuration with a reduced num -
ber of upstream unit operations and less generation of 
waste material [9, 10]. Additionally, cell metabolism can 
be exploited for the (re)-generation of co-factors and co- 
substrates provided that there is an attendant assimila
-
tion of a carbon and energy source during the reaction 
[11]. So far however there are no reported whole-yeast 
cell systems expressing recombinant ω-TAs that are 
operational in the direction from carbonyl to amine. For 
kinetic resolution on the other hand, recombinant yeast 
have previously been shown to be active in an aqueous 
buffer system supplemented with glucose as co-substrate 
[12]. Yet the whole-cell system demonstrated low specific 
activity, resulting in very low productivity and yield in the 
whole-cell biotransformation process. Further improve
-
ments of the whole-cell biocatalyst were achieved 
by coupling the transamination to a KRED (ketone 
reductase)-catalysed reduction to remove the co-product 
and thereby relieve product inhibition [13, 14]. Still, the 
catalytic activity of currently reported engineered yeast 
strains needs to be improved manifold in order to be 
competitive with current state-of-the art for ω-TA cataly
-
sis [3].
A potential limitation for kinetic resolution of racemic 
amines with metabolically active yeast cells is the avail -
ability of amine acceptors provided from glucose. ω-TAs 
of both bacterial [15–17] and plant [18–20] origin are 
able to utilize pyruvate as amine acceptor. Together with 
the central position of pyruvate in the carbon metabo
-
lism makes this a promising potential target to engineer 
for the improvement of whole-cell transamination. Ele
-
vated production of pyruvate in Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
was previously achieved by metabolic engineering of the 
pyruvate node by deletion of the pyruvate decarboxylase 
(PDC) genes PDC1 , PDC5, and PDC6  [21, 22]. The Pdc 
negative strain accumulated pyruvate, but was unable to 
grow on glucose without an external source of C
2 com-
pounds for synthesis of acetyl-CoA. Directed evolution 
of the Pdc negative strain in a long-term continuous cul
-
tivation setup led to the phenotypic trait of growth at 
high glucose concentration and pyruvate accumulation in 
aerobic batch mode without the necessity to add acetate 
[23]. It can be speculated that this strain would be an effi
-
cient platform for resolution of racemic amines by whole-
cell transamination.
Another engineering target that was previously shown 
to influence whole-cell transamination activity is the 
concentration of pyridoxal-5′ -phosphate (PLP) [12, 
24], which is an essential co-factor for all aminotrans
-
ferases. To increase the activity of PLP-dependent 
reactions, PLP is typically supplemented directly to 
the reaction solution thereby relieving potential limi
-
tations in availability [12, 25, 26]. An alternative to 
supplementation is the increase of intracellular levels 
by metabolic engineering of PLP biosynthetic path
-
ways. PLP is synthetized in two pathways: the ribose 
5-phosphate-dependent de novo pathway [27– 31], and 
the PLP-salvage pathway where the pyridoxine, pyri
-
doxal, and pyridoxamine scaffolds are interconverted 
and phosphorylated at the 5′ -hydroxyl group [32, 33]. It 
was recently shown that by introducing PdxS and PdxT  
encoding a PLP synthase complex originating from 
Bacillus subtilis into Escherichia coli, the intracellular 
PLP levels increased 2.4-fold [24]. This resulted in simi
-
lar specific whole-cell activity for biotransformation of 
l-lysine to cadaverine by a PLP-dependent lysine decar
-
boxylase (CadA), with or without the addition of PLP 
in the reaction solution [24]. In yeast, PLP biosynthesis 
has been found to correlate to extracellular concentra
-
tion of thiamine, which is an essential vitamin for cell 
growth and is typically part of defined mineral media 
[34]. Regulation of de novo biosynthesis of PLP and 
thiamine are thus closely intertwined, and the biosyn
-
thetic activity required for their formation is inversely 
correlated with extracellular availability [35, 36]. Based 
on this knowledge, we hypothesize that the omission 
of thiamine in the cultivation medium that lead to an 
increased intracellular PLP concentration will result in 
an improvement in specific whole-cell activity.

In the present study, we investigated different bioen -
gineering strategies to modify the intracellular environ -
ment of S. cerevisiae with the aim to increase specific 
in  vivo transamination activity. As model reaction, we 
used kinetic resolution of racemic 1-phenylethylamine 
(PEA) to (R)-1-PEA with sole addition of glucose to sup

the specific in vivo transaminase activity of three ω-TAs 
with the same substrate and stereo-selectivity, but with 
distinct origin (plant and bacteria), different pH optima, 
and reaction kinetics were compared. Differences in spe

into potential desirable enzyme characteristics for opti

a previously developed Pdc negative pyruvate accumulat

host for whole-cell kinetic resolution. Furthermore, we 
analysed the effect of thiamine omission in the cultivation 
medium with the aim to increase intracellular PLP lev

els and thereby decrease the dependence of adding PLP 
to the reaction solution. We also increased the TA gene 
copy number sixfold, which in combination with culti

vation in thiamine-free medium and with an increased 
biomass concentration during the bioconversion resulted 
in complete kinetic resolution of 25 mM racemic 1-PEA 
to (R)-1-PEA in a reaction configuration with glucose as 
co-substrate. Finally, the most active yeast catalyst was 
investigated for direct asymmetric transamination of ace

tophenone to (S)-1-PEA with l-alanine as amine donor 
(Fig.  1b). We speculated that the endogenous pyruvate

Results
Comparison of three different ω‑transaminases 
for whole‑cell transamination in S. cerevisiae
S. cerevisiae expressing ω -TA gene from the chili pep -
per plant C. chinense (CC-TA) was previously shown to 
be functional as whole-cell biocatalyst for the kinetic 
resolution of racemic 1-phenylethylamine (PEA) to (R )-
1-PEA, but with relatively low specific activity [12]. To 
investigate if there was a more suitable transaminase for 
the yeast bio-catalytic system, two additional S. cerevi
-
siae strains were constructed containing two other TAs: 
the well-characterized ω -TA from the beta-proteobacte -
rium C. violaceum (CV-TA) [15, 37, 38] and the previ -
ously reported ω -TA from the alpha-proteobacterium 
O. anthropi (OA-TA) [17, 42], which has shown neither 
substrate nor product inhibition. The three enzymes all 
possess similar substrate specificity and enantio-selec
-
tivity; however, they have differences in acetophenone 
inhibition kinetics and optimal pHs (Table  1). In the pre

sent study, the codon-optimized synthetic genes were 
cloned into a yeast integrative vector (YIpNW) (Table  2) 
and transformed into the parental strain TMB4150 gen

erating CV-TA strain (TMB4369) and OA-TA strain 
(TMB4371) (Table  3). The three strains were com
-
pared for the kinetic resolution of racemic 1-PEA in a 
reaction configuration where PLP was supplemented 
and glucose was used as co-substrate for the supply of 
amine acceptors. As previously observed [12], CC-TA 
strain converted (S )-1-PEA to acetophenone (ACP) 
during 48  h after which the reaction stopped, reaching 
only 6.1% final conversion (Fig.  2). The reaction rate of 
OA-TA strain was similar to CC-TA strain during the 
first 4  h (0.16  mmol (S )-1-PEA/g dw/h vs. 0.15  mmol

(S)-1-PEA/g dw/h, respectively), however, the OA-TA 
strain continuously resolved racemic 1-PEA until 120 h, 
thereby achieving almost threefold higher conversion 
(17.2%). The best result was obtained with CV-TA strain 
that had a more than fourfold higher initial specific 
activity (0.64 mmol (S )-1-PEA/g dw/h) than the CC-TA 
strain. Although the reaction rate decreased between 4 
and 120  h, 38.5% conversion was achieved after 120  h, 
resulting in the highest ee  (64.4%) of (R)-1-PEA.   
Influence of intracellular pyruvate accumulation 
on whole‑cell transamination
The intracellular pyruvate derived from glucose through 
glycolysis may be limited for transamination due to the 
presence of endogenous pyruvate-catalysing enzymes 
such as the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (Pdh), 
pyruvate decarboxylase (Pdc), and pyruvate carboxylase 
(Pyc) [39]. In order to verify this hypothesis, whole-cell 
transamination was performed using the pyruvate-accu
-
mulating TAM strain [23]. As CV-TA had the best prop -
erties for whole-cell transamination, the TAM strain was 
transformed with plasmid pNW12 resulting in CV-TA 
TAM strain (TMB4374) (Tables  2, 3). To prepare bio
-
mass for the subsequent whole-cell reaction, CV-TA and 
CV-TA TAM strains were grown in a mineral medium 
containing 20  g/l glucose as well as 3  g/l ethanol to 
increase the growth rate of CV-TA TAM strain as pre
-
viously reported [40]. Under these conditions, the latter 
reached a final OD 620 of 5.3  ± 0.2 after 31 h, compared 
to OD 620 7.1  ±  0.1 after 24  h for CV-TA strain (Addi -
tional file 1: Figure S1). Glucose consumption was nearly 
sixfold faster for CV-TA strain with ethanol as primary 
by-product, compared to CV-TA TAM strain that did 
not produce ethanol. Under the evaluated conditions, 
both strains produced pyruvate concentrations below the 
detection limit.
When investigated for whole-cell transamination, 
the CV-TA strain showed 34.6% conversion after 70  h 
(Fig. 3), while the CV-TA TAM strain had slightly higher 
conversion (40.1% conversion after 70  h). The conver
-
sion for the CV-TA strain was the same as for the experi-
ments described above (Fig.  2), thereby demonstrating 
that supplementation of ethanol in the medium during 
the pre-cultivation step did not influence the specific 
activity of the whole-cell biocatalyst. Glucose consump
-
tion and formation of ethanol and glycerol during the 
progress of the reaction were significantly lower for the 
CV-TA TAM strain as compared to the control (Fig.  4a, 
b). Thus, the amount of glucose required to provide suf
-
ficient levels of amine acceptor was lower in the TAM 
strain background. Extracellular pyruvate accumulation 
was not detected for either of the strains, which in the 
case of the TAM strain is most probably due to a com
-
bination of depletion by the transaminase-catalysed 
reaction and an insufficient aeration under the applied 
reaction conditions.

Omission of thiamine in the cultivation medium 
during biocatalyst production improves whole‑cell 
biocatalyst activity
Availability of intracellular PLP contributes to a signifi -
cant degree to the activity of PLP-dependent enzymes 
in living cells, as has been observed previously [12]. We 
therefore investigated whether the omission of thiamine 
in the cultivation medium, which previously was shown 
to result in increased PLP levels, would also result in 
higher specific whole-cell transamination activity in a 
subsequent bioconversion step. When cultivated in a 
medium without thiamine, the CV-TA strain (TMB4369) 
displayed a substantially reduced maximal specific 
growth rate (0.24  ±  0.0/h) as compared to when thia
-
mine was added (0.31  ± 0.0/h), but no substantial effect 
on the by-product distribution (ethanol, glycerol, acetate) 
was observed. Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrom

intracellular PLP , and it could indeed be demonstrated 
that the omission of thiamine led to a 1.5- to 2-fold 
increase in concentration (data not shown).
To see the effect of thiamine on whole-cell bioconver
-
sion, the yeast cells were used for transamination with 
and without further addition of PLP . When thiamine was 
present in the cultivation medium, a substantially higher 
conversion was obtained with PLP added to the reaction 
solution (38.5% as compared to 25.4% without addition of 
thiamine; Fig. 5). In contrast, when thiamine was omitted 
in the culture step, the addition of PLP in the biotrans
-
formation step had a smaller effect on the conversion, 
i.e. 40.5% conversion was obtained compared to 36.7% 
conversion without the addition of PLP . Thus, it can be 
concluded that omission of thiamine during cultivation 
indeed increased the whole-cell activity in the subse
-
quent reaction step.
Influence of TA gene copy number and cell loading 
on whole‑cell transamination
It has previously been shown that an increased transami -
nase gene copy number led to higher specific in  vivo 
transaminase activity [13]. To evaluate if this observa -
tion still held with a ω-TA having higher specific in vivo 
enzyme activity in yeast, a strain with sixfold higher 
number of copies of the CV-TA gene (TMB4375) was 
constructed and used for whole-cell transamination. 
The whole-cell biocatalyst was produced without adding 
thiamine in the medium during the cultivation step, and 
glucose was used as sole co-substrate in the subsequent 
reactions that were performed without addition of PLP 
to the solution. Indeed, when using the same amount 
of cells (5  gdw/l) for the reaction, a considerable higher 
conversion (44.7%) was reached (Fig.  6) compared to 
the strain carrying only onefold copies of CV-TA gene 
(36.7%) (Fig. 5).
To see if it would be possible to reach full conversion by 
increasing the amount of the whole-cell biocatalyst with 
high TA-gene copy-number, kinetic resolution of 25 mM 
racemic 1-PEA was carried out with two cell loadings (5 
and 25 g/l dw). The initial reaction rate for both cell load
-
ings was very similar (0.33 mmol (S)-1-PEA/g dw/h with 
25 g/l dw vs. 0.32 mmol (S)-1-PEA/g dw/h with 5 g/l dw) 
during the first 24 h. However, with 25 g/l dw whole-cell 
biocatalyst, 50% conversion and an ee of (R)-1-PEA > 99% 
was reached within 72 h (Fig. 6).
Whole‑cell transamination of acetophenone 
to (S)‑1‑phenylethylamine
As an alternative to kinetic resolution of a racemic sub -
strate, chiral amines can be produced by direct asymmet-
ric transamination of the ketone. However, the reaction 
equilibrium for ω-transaminations often lies in the direc -
tion towards the ketone which is a major challenge for 
reaching high conversion. In the case for direct synthe

(e.g. l-alanine) as amine donor, the Gibbs free energy was 
calculated using the group contribution method [41] to 
be ΔG 0′  = +4.01  kcal/mol, i.e. the reaction is thus not 
thermodynamically favourable. It can be hypothesised 
that the native pyruvate dissimilating enzymes in yeast, 
e.g. Pdc, pyruvate dehydrogenase (Pdh), and pyruvate 
carboxylase (Pyc), in principle may be used for co-prod
-
uct removal and thereby drive the reaction towards the 
amine. To shed some light into the potential of the native 
pyruvate metabolism to drive asymmetric transamina
-
tion, the conversion of acetophenone to (S)-1-PEA with 
addition of an excess of l-alanine was evaluated with 
the yeast strain expressing six copies of the CV-TA gene 
(TMB4375) and thereby having the highest transaminase 
activity. Indeed, the product was detected after biocon
-
version for 24  h, but at very low titers (0.35  mM (S)-1-
PEA, Additional file  1: Figure S2), demonstrating that 
the reaction indeed is possible but significantly limited 
under the conditions used. In addition to (S)-1-PEA, the 
formation of low amount (S)-1-phenylethanol was also 
detected, demonstrating that endogenous acetophenone 
reductases are also active in the whole-cell system under 
the applied reaction conditions (Additional file  1: Figure 
S2).
Discussion
In this study, major improvements in whole-cell transam-
ination with engineered S. cerevisiae were achieved 
through the identification of relevant parameters, such as 
the type and intracellular level of ω-transaminase. Also, 
the need to increase the intracellular concentration of the 
involved co-substrates and co-factors was investigated. 
The use of a S. cerevisiae strain with elevated pyruvate 
concentration enabled slightly higher conversion than 
the reference strain. Furthermore, cells grown in the 
absence of thiamine gave higher conversion under condi
-
tions where PLP was omitted. Notably, complete kinetic 
resolution of 25  mM racemic 1-phenylethylamine was 
achieved with glucose as co-substrate and using a strain 
containing six copies of CV-TA, high cell density, and 
no added PLP . To the best of our knowledge, the yeast 
catalyst TMB4375 described herein thus has the highest 
ω-TA activity so far reported for a metabolically active 
whole-cell system that exploits cell metabolism to supply 
both PLP and amine acceptor for the reaction.
Enzymes that are optimized for purified systems might 
not be optimal for a whole-cell system due to factors 
such as incompatible pH optima, temperature optima, 
or enzyme kinetics. pH optima of 7–8, 9, and 8.5–9 were 
previously recorded for the ω-TA from C. chinense [18], 
O. anthropi [42] and C. violaceum [37], respectively, 
which should be compared with S. cerevisiae intracel
-
lular cytosolic pH of 7–7.5 (depending on extracellular 
pH, and growth phase) [43, 44]. Therefore, this param
-
eter does not per se explain the highest conversion 
observed with CV-TA. Comparison of in vitro activities 
of the different enzymes does not clarify the better per
-
formance of CV-TA in the whole-cell system either, since 
CV-TA showed more than twofold higher conversion 
than CC-TA but nearly fourfold lower conversion than 
OA-TA in cell extracts (Additional file  1: Figure S3). In 
whole cells however, the intracellular level of substrate,

co-substrates, and co-factors is highly dependent on cell 
metabolism and intermembrane transport, which con -
trasts with isolated enzyme catalysts where the levels 
of the different components can be freely adjusted. This 
leads to the observation that the enzyme and host metab
-
olism need to be compatible and enzyme evaluation 
should be performed in combination with the host. It has 
been claimed that OA-TA has no substrate or product 
inhibition [17], and it indeed displayed minor reduction 
of the reaction rate during the whole-cell process com
-
pared to CV-TA and CC-TA. OA-TA has previously been 
reported to have a greater K
m value compared to other 
ω-TAs [17]. Therefore, we believe that the observed lower 
reaction rates for OA-TA in the whole-cell system was 
due to lower substrate affinity and suboptimal intracellu
-
lar substrate concentration, as the substrate has to diffuse 
through the cell membrane.
In addition to the role of enzyme kinetics, we also 
highlighted the necessity to provide sufficient amount of 
the biocatalyst as full conversion was achieved by both 
increasing the TA gene copy number, i.e. the intracellu
-
lar TA level, and to provide an increased amount of cells. 
It is likely that an even faster process can be achieved by 
introducing a reductase, which will further convert ACP 
to its less inhibitory alcohol product, as efficiently dem
-
onstrated previously by over-expressing a KRED from 
Lactobacillus kefir together with CC-TA in S. cerevisiae 
[13], or by the use of endogenous reductases to releave 
inhibition of recombinant Vibrio fluvialis JS17 ω-TA in 
Pichia pastoris [45].
We previously demonstrated that glucose could repre
-
sent a significantly cheaper co-substrate than pyruvate 
for whole-cell transamination, by providing not only 
intracellular pyruvate through glycolysis, but also giving 
higher cell viability and higher conversion without the 
addition of co-factor PLP [12]. In order to limit pyruvate 
dissimilation through ethanol formation, the deletion 
of Pdc activity [23] was seen as the next step in process 
optimization as more pyruvate should be made available 
inside the cells. Previous trials using the Pdc negative 
strain indeed led to about 20  g/l extracellular pyruvate 
production after 24  h from 100  g/l glucose. During the 
cultivation of CV-TA TAM strain a significantly lower 
amount (1.5–2 g/l) pyruvate was measured. This may be 
explained by the drastic reduction of the pH (2.7 after 
24 h) and limitation in aeration, which is needed for the 
re-oxidation of NADH. Despite of this, slightly higher 
conversion of racemic 1-phenylethylamine was achieved 
compared to the control strain with PDC activity.
Omission of thiamine in the culture medium used for 
production of the whole-cell biocatalyst led to substan
-
tially improved transamination in the absence of added 
PLP co-factor. Thiamine (vitamin B
1) has previously been 
suggested to inhibit PLP (one form of vitamin B 6) syn -
thesis in Saccharomyces carlsbergensis 4228 [35]. Also a 
S. cerevisiae laboratory strain derived from S288C had a 
substantially lower specific growth rate when thiamine 
and no pyridoxine were added to the culture medium 
[46]. This was suspected to be due to a high affinity of 
THI10 encoded thiamine transporter [47], which led 
to increasing intracellular thiamine concentration and 
repression of PLP biosynthesis. There is also a connec
-
tion between thiamine and PLP on a biosynthetic level, 
as PLP , or one of its closely related forms, and histidine 
are building blocks for one of the precursors (4-amino-
5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine monophosphate 
(HMP-P)) of thiamine [48, 49]. It has additionally been 
reported that genes SNO2, SNO3, SNZ2, and SNZ3 are 
up-regulated in the absence of thiamine [36], and that 
overexpression of these genes in a laboratory strain 
leads to nearly the same specific growth rate when thi
-
amine and not pyridoxine were added to the culture 
medium [46]. SNO1 and SNZ1 , which are genes coding 
for enzymes synthesizing PLP in the de novo pathway in 
S. cerevisiae [28, 31, 50], have a very high sequence simi
-
larity to SNO2, SNO3 and SNZ2, SNZ3 respectively. Here 
we demonstrated that thiamine deficiency indeed led to 
higher intracellular PLP concentration. Even if the maxi
-
mal growth rate was reduced by 20%, the final cell density 
was in a similar range after 24 h (OD
620 = 7.0 ± 0.4 with 
thiamine, OD620 = 6.6  ± 0.4 without thiamine). Overall, 
the omission of thiamine led to a higher conversion, and 
improved the process by two factors: first the addition of 
thiamine and PLP was avoided and second, higher con
-
version was achieved.
In conclusion, the best reaction set-up for kinetic res -
olution of racemic 1-phenylethylamine with glucose as 
only co-substrate consists of using the strain with several 
copies of CV-TA with high cell loading, and performing 
cultivation without thiamine. The use of metabolically 
active yeast over-expressing selective transaminases for 
biocatalytic transamination is a promising strategy, since 
it is simple and requires only glucose as co-substrate for 
the supply of both the amine acceptor and the co-factor 
P L P.
We report also the use of S. cerevisiae for asymmetric 
synthesis of (S)-1-PEA, albeit with low conversion. To 
combat the unfavourable reaction equilibrium that lies 
in direction of the ketone, co-product removal has previ
-
ously been shown to improve reaction efficiency. For the 
use of l-alanine as amine donor, a multitude of enzymatic 
in  vitro co-product removal systems have previously 
been developed, e.g. based on the conversion of pyru
-
vate back to l-alanine by alanine dehydrogenase (Aldh) 
[26, 51], or pyruvate to acetaldehyde and CO
2 by Pdc 
[52]. Yeast possess a number of enzymes that catalyse the 
Page 10 of 12Weber et al. Microb Cell Fact  (2017) 16:3 
conversion of pyruvate, e.g. into acetaldehyde by Pdc and 
further to ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase. However, in 
our hands the engineered yeast catalyst was operational 
with only very low activity in the direction towards the 
amine, which indicates that the native pyruvate metabo
-
lism was either not functional efficiently or that it did not 
have the capacity to remove pyruvate under the tested 
conditions. It is likely that engineering of process condi
-
tions in combination with further increase of transami -
nase activity and of pyruvate dissimilatory pathways may 
improve conversion. An alternative strategy may be to 
explore other amine donors that have a more favourable 
thermodynamic equilibrium and/or more efficient co-
product removal.
Methods
Chemicals
Acetophenone (ACP), racemic 1-phenylethylamine 
(1-PEA), (R)-1-PEA and (S)-1-PEA were bought from 
Merck (Hohenbrunn, Germany), pyridoxal-5′-phosphate 
(PLP) from AppliChem (Darmstadt, Germany), and all 
other chemicals from VWR (Leuven, Belgium).
Strains, media, and cell growth
Escherichia coli strain DH5α (Life Technologies, Rock -
ville, MD, USA) was used for subcloning. S. cerevisiae 
strain TMB4150 (M ATa, ura3-52 MAL2-8
C SUC2) was 
kindly provided by Jan Knudsen, Applied Microbiology, 
Lund University, Sweden. TAM strain was kindly pro
-
vided by Antonius van Maris, Department of Biotech -
nology, Delft University of Technology, Netherlands. 
S. cerevisiae strains TMB4367, TMB4369, TMB4371, 
TMB4374, and TMB4375 (see construction below; 
Tables  2, 3) were used for whole-cell transamination. 
Strains were kept as 20% glycerol stocks at −80  °C and 
grown on solid media for 2 days prior to experiments.
Transformation and cell growth was performed as 
described previously [12] except that defined mineral 
medium [53] was used instead of YPG medium. The min
-
eral medium without thiamine contained the same con -
centration as previously described except for thiamine 
[53]. For cultivation of the pyruvate decarboxylase dele
-
tion mutant TAM, 3 g/l ethanol was added to the mineral 
medium.
Nucleic acid manipulation
Plasmid DNA was prepared with the GeneJET Plasmid 
Miniprep Kit (Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA) 
and agarose gel DNA extraction was performed using 
QIAquick
® Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, 
Germany). Primers from MWG-Biotech AG (Ebersberg, 
Germany) and Phusion Hot Start II DNA Polymerase 
and dNTPs from Thermo Scientific (Rockford, IL, USA) 
were used for polymerase chain reactions (PCR) and per
-
formed in a GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosys-
tems, Foster City, CA, USA). PCR products were purified 
with the GeneJET PCR Purification Kit (Thermo Scien
-
tific, Rockford, IL, USA). Sequencing was performed by 
MWG-Biotech AG (Ebersberg, Germany). InFusion
® HD 
Cloning Kit (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA, 
USA) was used for DNA manipulation.
Strain construction
The yeast-codon optimized coding regions of the ω-TA 
genes from C. violaceum (GenBank: WP011135573.1, 
Swiss-Prot: Q7NWG4) and from O. anthropi (Gen
-
Bank: YP001368759.1, Swiss-Prot: A6WVC6) were PCR 
amplified from pUC57-CV and pUC57-OA (Table  2), 
respectively, using the primers listed in Additional file  1: 
Table S1. YIpOB7 was cut with BglII to remove XDH 
gene and self-ligated to create YIpNW, which was cut 
with XbaI and the PCR fragments inserted by InFusion
® 
cloning, thus creating pNW12 and pNW14 (Table  2). 
Correct orientation of the inserts and sequences were 
verified by restriction enzyme analysis and sequencing. 
Integrative vectors pNW12 and pNW14 were cleaved 
with ApaI within the URA3 marker gene and then used 
to transform the haploid laboratory strain TMB4150, 
resulting in CV-TA strain (TMB4369) and OA-TA strain 
(TMB4371), or the TAM strain, which resulted in CV-TA 
TAM strain (TMB4374) (Table  3). The 6× CV-TA strain 
(TMB4375) was constructed by transforming the haploid 
laboratory strain TMB4150 with pNW12 and screening 
a large number of transformants with qPCR for multiple 
single-crossing over integration events. Determination 
of relative gene copy number by qPCR was performed 
as described previously [13] except that qPCR primers 
named AMP were used (Additional file 1: Table S1). TPI1 
qPCR primers were used as internal standard.
Whole‑cell transamination
50  ml sealed serum flasks with magnetic stirring 
(140  rpm) and 5 or 25  g/l cell dry weight (dw) at 30  °C 
were used for whole-cell transamination. The reaction 
solution contained 10  ml 100  mM sodium phosphate 
buffer (pH 7.0), 100 g/l glucose, 25 mM racemic 1-PEA, 
and 0–0.1  mM PLP . For direct asymmetric transamina
-
tion of acetophenone to (S)-1-PEA, the reaction solution 
contained the same buffer, 25 g/l cell dry weight (dw), 500 
mM l-alanine, 0.1 mM PLP , 50 g/L glucose and 10 mM 
acetophenone.
Analyses
Growth was monitored by measuring optical density 
at a wavelength of 620  nm (OD
620) with an Ultrospec 
2100pro spectrophotometer (Amersham Biosciences, 
Page 11 of 12
Weber et al. Microb Cell Fact  (2017) 16:3 
Sweden). Cell dry weight determination was performed 
as previously described, as was the determination by nor-
mal and reverse phase HPLC of (R)-1-phenylethylamine, 
(S)-1-phenylethylamine, (R)-1-phenylethanol, (S)-1-phe
-
nylethanol, acetophenone, glucose, glycerol, acetate, suc -
cinate, and ethanol [12]. Pyruvate was detected by the 
same HPLC method as previously described for glucose 
and its metabolites [12], except that a UV spectrophoto
-
metric detector (Shimadzu SPD-6A) at 214 nm was used 
instead.
