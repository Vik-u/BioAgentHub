Summary
/C15 With over 60 parallel origins representing evolutionary replicates, C 4 photosynthesis is
well-suited for studying complex trait evolution. However, lineages with diverse C 3–C4 inter-
mediate species are scarce, leaving uncertainty in models of C 4 evolution.
/C15 Phenotypic characterization of 28 living species of Blepharis (Acanthaceae) is presented,
including photosynthetic gas exchange, enzyme activity assays, cell ultrastructure, and δ13C
assays, the latter including 92 herbarium specimens from three species with phenotypic diver-
sity. A well-resolved transcriptome-based phylogeny provides evolutionary context.
/C15 C3, proto-Kranz, C 2,C 4-like, and C 4 phenotypes occur in Blepharis sect. Acanthodium. The
phylogeny supports a stepwise progression from C 3 through C2 to C4 states and up to ﬁve dis-
tinct origins of the C 4 cycle. Substantial intraspeciﬁc C 2–C4 variation is demonstrated in Ble-
pharis mitrata, Blepharis furcata, and Blepharis macra. Blepharis gazensis is a monospeciﬁc
C4 lineage exhibiting an NADP malic enzyme C 4 pathway with features of the NAD-ME sub-
type, extending the ways in which the C 4 cycle is known to function.
/C15 Substantial photosynthetic diversity exists in Blepharis that rivals or exceeds the range of
character states present in other C 3 to C 4 transitional lineages. This diversity in Blepharis
represents a robust new model for studying convergent evolution of C 4 photosynthesis and
complex traits in general.
Introduction
Darwin’s ‘endless forms most beautiful’ in the living world are
the result of eons of evolutionary innovation characterized by the
emergence of increasing complexity (Darwin, 1859). Complex
traits create novel ecological opportunities and promote diversiﬁ-
cation (Yoder et al., 2010; Stroud & Losos, 2016). Although it
may seem that complex traits are difﬁcult to evolve and should
arise infrequently, numerous examples of their convergent evolu-
tion exist (Conway Morris, 2003; Losos, 2018). One of the best
is C
4 photosynthesis, a CO 2-concentrating mechanism (CCM)
in terrestrial plants that emerged over 60 times despite requiring
modiﬁcation of hundreds or even thousands of genes (Sage, 2016;
Niklaus & Kelly, 2019). Convergent evolution enables compara-
tive methods, with independent lineages treated as natural repli-
cates (Harmon, 2018) and facilitates investigation of the core
requirements of a complex phenotype as well as the extent to
which the underlying mechanisms also converge (Losos, 2011;
Khoshravesh et al., 2020a). Species exhibiting both phenotypic
and phylogenetic intermediacy are particularly useful, as these
may represent ancestral states which have persisted to the present
(Monson et al., 1984; Sage et al., 2012; Lundgren et al., 2015).
Phenotypically intermediate species occur in about one-quarter
of all C
4 lineages, making C 4 photosynthesis a rich case to study
how evolution builds complexity. In most C 4 lineages in which
intermediates occur, however, there are typically only a few inter-
mediate species, most of which have the same phenotype. An
important exception is Flaveria (Asteraceae), which is considered
a model genus for C
4 evolution due to the presence of numerous
intermediate states (Ku et al., 1983, 1991; McKown et al., 2005;
Schulze et al., 2013; Adachi et al., 2023). The grass Alloteropsis
semialata has also risen to prominence due to the discovery of C 3,
C4, and intermediate genotypes or subspecies (Lundgren
et al., 2016, 2019; Dunning et al., 2019; Pereira et al., 2023).
However, unanswered questions in C 4 evolution require addi-
tional intermediate-rich clades to enable robust comparative ana-
lyses (Stata et al., 2019). The genus Blepharis (Acanthaceae) is
particularly promising, with Fisher et al.( 2015) hypothesizing
the presence of dozens of intermediate species, more than found
in any other C
4 lineage.Present address: Matt Stata, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Michigan

Research
Most C 3–C4 intermediate species exhibit a phenotype now
known as C 2 photosynthesis, although these have historically
been referred to simply as C 3–C4 intermediates (Edwards &
Ku, 1987; Sage et al., 2014). The core modiﬁcation in C 2 photo-
synthesis is the restriction of the photorespiratory enzyme glycine
decarboxylase (GDC) to vascular sheath cells, typically the bun-
dle sheath (BS), which forces photorespiratory glycine produced
in the mesophyll (M) tissue to diffuse into the BS for decarboxy-
lation, facilitating concentration and reﬁxation of CO
2 in the BS
(Sage et al., 2012). C 2 species exhibit photosynthetic CO 2 com-
pensation points ( ᴦ) and O 2 inhibition of net CO 2 assimilation
rates that are intermediate between C 3 and C 4 values (Ku
et al., 1983, 1991; Khoshravesh et al., 2016, 2020b; Adachi
et al., 2023). Although metabolically simpler than C 4 photo-
synthesis, the C 2 CCM enhances photosynthesis at low intercel-
lular CO 2 concentration (C i) and is hypothesized to establish a
biochemical and structural foundation for assembling the C 4
pathway (Rawsthorne, 1992; Sage et al., 2014). Because the C 2
phenotype is considered to be relatively stable and adaptive in its
own right, research addressing C 4 evolution has shifted to con-
sider how C 2 photosynthesis evolved from C 3 and, in turn, how
the C 4 cycle emerges from the C 2 state (Heckmann et al., 2013;
Sage et al., 2014). Addressing these transitions requires the dis-
covery of more C 3–C2 and C2–C4 intermediates.
While close C 2 relatives have been documented in numerous
C4 lineages, until recently there has been a scarcity of intermedi-
ate phenotypes reﬂecting the C 3 to C 2 and C 2 to C 4 transitions.
In the past 20 years, the number of species known to exhibit
intermediate character states has increased, particularly those
spanning the C 3 and C 2 phenotypes, informing models of how
the C2 pathway evolved. A distinctive C 3 to C2 intermediate phe-
notype proposed to be an early stage of C 2 evolution is the
proto-Kranz phenotype, which was ﬁrst recognized in Euploca
(Boraginaceae; Muhaidat et al., 2011) and has since been identi-
ﬁed in the eudicot lineages Flaveria (Asteraceae; Sage et al., 2013;
Adachi et al., 2023), Salsola (Amaranthaceae; Voznesenskaya
et al., 2013), and Tribulus (Zygophyllaceae; Leung et al., 2024),
as well as the grass lineages Steinchisma, Neurachne, and Homole-
pis (Poaceae; Khoshravesh et al ., 2016, 2020b; Alvarenga
et al., 2025). The proto-Kranz condition is characterized by
increased abundance of organelles in the BS and centripetal loca-
lization of BS mitochondria. These patterns are hypothesized to
enhance reﬁxation of photorespired CO
2 in the BS and to facili-
tate the subsequent establishment of the C 2 pathway by creating
selection for reduction of GDC in M cells (Sage et al., 2012).
Concordantly, the discovery of incomplete, sub-C 2 phenotypes
in Flaveria (Sage et al., 2013; Adachi et al., 2023), Neurachne
(Khoshravesh et al., 2020b), Tribulus (Leung et al., 2024), and
Homolepis (Alvarenga et al., 2025), supports a hypothesis that
restriction of GDC to the BS occurs gradually.
In contrast to C 2 photosynthesis, which primarily requires the
loss of GDC from M cells, the transition from C 2 to C 4 photo-
synthesis necessitates cell-speciﬁc upregulation of multiple
enzymes and transporters along with the integration of the C 4
and photosynthetic carbon reduction (PCR) cycles (Monson
et al., 1986; Moore et al., 1988). Two identiﬁed phenotypes
representing stages during the C
2–C4 transition were historically
known as Type II C 2 (or simply Type II C 3-C4) and C 4-like
photosynthesis. Whereas typical (Type I) C 2 species lack signiﬁ-
cant C 4 cycle activity, Type II C 2 species exhibit moderate upre-
gulation of some C 4 cycle enzymes (Edwards & Ku, 1987;
Adachi et al., 2023). However, the nascent, incomplete C 4 cycle
in these species contributes little to net CO 2 assimilation (Mon-
son et al., 1986, 1988; Edwards & Ku, 1987; Alonso-Cantabrana
& von Caemmerer, 2016; Adachi et al., 2023). In contrast,
C4-like species have a strong and well-integrated C 4 cycle yet
retain some Rubisco activity and C 3 photosynthesis in M cells
(Monson et al., 1987; Cheng et al., 1988; Moore et al., 1989;
Monson & Rawsthorne, 2000). The clearest examples of C 2–C4
intermediate phenotypes occur only in Flaveria (F. ramosissima,
Type II C 2,a n d F. brownii,C 4-like; Adachi et al., 2023). The
scarcity of C 2–C4 intermediates in other transitional lineages has
led to the suggestion that the assembly and integration of the C 4
cycle may have occurred in a punctuated manner, leaving much
uncertainty about the key evolutionary steps (Stata et al., 2019).
This deﬁciency is signiﬁcant, since it represents the entire upregu-
lation and integration of C
4 metabolism. There is thus a need to
identify multiple, parallel lineages with a high diversity of inter-
mediate phenotypes, particularly those representing late stages in
C
4 evolution. Blepharis stands out as uniquely promising due to
its large number of putative intermediates, including two possible
C
4-like species (Fisher et al., 2015).
Blepharis is an old-world genus of 128 species inhabiting arid
regions in Africa, Arabia, and southeast Asia and is classiﬁed into
three infrageneric groups (Vollesen, 2000). C 4 photosynthesis,
ﬁrst reported in B. scindica in 1975, has also been characterized
in B. attenuata and B. ciliaris (Sankhla et al., 1975; Muhaidat
et al., 2007; Akhani et al., 2008). Based on δ13C data, Fisher
et al.( 2015) identiﬁed 13 C 4 Blepharis species, all within section
Acanthodium. Based on anatomical observations of herbarium
specimens, they hypothesized many of the remaining 44 sect.
Acanthodium species could be intermediates, including the two
putative C
4-like species; however, the lack of live plants pre-
vented conﬁrmation of intermediate physiology. This study
examines the physiological and anatomical diversity of 28
Blepharis species. We integrate gas exchange measurements, δ
13C
analysis, enzyme assays, ultrastructural observations, and
transcriptome-based phylogenetic inference. We also include a
comprehensive phylogenetic network analysis to investigate evi-
dence of hybridization in Blepharis (Supporting Information
Notes S1). In addition, we present analysis of δ
13C values from
98 herbarium accessions of three Blepharis species in which our
physiological assays detected C 4 and non-C 4 phenotypes.
Our results show that Blepharis is a remarkably dynamic C 3–C4
transitional lineage, with diverse photosynthetic phenotypes
including C 2–C4 intermediacy, multiple origins of C 4 photo-
synthesis, and a previously unknown variant of the C 4 pathway.
Nomenclature of C 3–C4 intermediates

I and II C 2 terms being particularly ambiguous. To resolve these
nomenclatural issues, a simple, logical scheme of trait progression
from the C
3 to C 4 character states has been proposed (Leung
et al., 2024; Alvarenga et al., 2025), where:
C3 ! C3þ ! proto/C0 Kranz ! C2/C0 ! C2 ! C2þ ! C4/C0 ! C4
In this nomenclature, a ‘ +’ represents an augmentation to a
typical C3 or C 2 character state that can facilitate transition to the
next character state, while a ‘ /C0 ’ represents an incomplete expres-
sion of the next character state in the transition. Character states
that appear to mark major stages in the transition are given distinc-
tive descriptors, such as proto-Kranz or C
2. The former Type I C 2
intermediate would be simply C 2, while the Type II intermediate
augmented with a nascent C 4 cycle is a C 2+.C 4-like species such
as F. brownii are now classiﬁed as C 4/C0 (= sub-C4 in Alvarenga
et al.,2025), reﬂecting that they are largely C 4 in function but lack
key features such as complete compartmentalization of Rubisco
and the C 3 pathway into the BS tissue. Similarly, C 2 species with
incomplete GDC localization to the BS are classiﬁed as C 2/C0 (=
sub-C2 in Alvarenga et al.,2025). As new character states are dis-
covered, they can readily be slotted into this scheme, and if sufﬁ-
ciently distinctive, they could be given their own designation. In
this study of Blepharis, we follow this nomenclature.
Materials and Methods
Plant materials and growth conditions
Seeds were collected from ﬁeld sites or herbarium samples as out-
lined in Table S1, which also includes all species authority infor-
mation; Fig. S1 provides images of species in their native
habitats. In general, germination was rapid (about a day), and
seeds did not require special treatments as they are explosively
released from their capsules upon hydration (Gutterman, 1993).
Even in the case of seeds from herbarium specimens or seed
libraries, if the seeds were viable, germination was rapid and easy,
with no age-induced dormancy or recalcitrance. We also found
that seeds could be desiccated and frozen without loss of viability
for longer term storage. Plants were grown in a glasshouse at the
University of Toronto in 12 L pots with 27 –30°C days,
22–25°C nights, and photosynthetic photon ﬂux density (PPFD)
of ≥ 1500 μmol m
/C0 2 s/C0 1 on clear days or ≥ 300 μmol m /C0 2 s/C0 1
on cloudy days supplemented by high-pressure sodium lighting.
Plants were grown in a soil blend comprising equal parts sand,
vermiculite, topsoil, and ProMix (Premier Tech Home and Gar-
den, QC, Canada) formulated to approximate soil of arid regions
with reduced organic content while remaining relatively loose
and well-aerated to minimize root rot. Plants were watered daily
and fertilized weekly with a 50 : 50 mix of 21-7-7 acid fertilizer
and 20-20-20 general-purpose fertilizer, plus a supplement of
30 μM iron Ethylenediamine di(o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid),
1 mM calcium nitrate, and 1 mM magnesium sulfate (Plant Pro-
ducts, ON, Canada). We found the plants easy to maintain
under these conditions, provided they did not experience
excessive watering or severe drought. Samples for enzyme assays,
δ
13C, and RNA-seq were collected in the glasshouse. For gas
exchange and microscopy, plants were transferred to Conviron
PGC20 growth chambers (Conviron Canada, Winnipeg, MB)
with 30 °C day, 25 °C night temperatures, a 13-h photoperiod,
and 1100 –1200 μmol m
/C0 2 PPFD at the top of the leaf canopy
for 2 wk before analysis. Growth chambers were used to prepare
plants for gas exchange analyses because we could maintain con-
stant growth conditions over the lengthy time required to com-
plete the gas exchange measurements (e.g. by maintaining a
constant photoperiod). Because sampling for enzyme assays,
RNA-seq, and starch δ
13C could each be conducted in a single
day but required more space for the complete collection, these
were conducted on glasshouse-grown plants in early-to-mid Sep-
tember, when conditions were similar to the growth chambers.
All analyses used the most recent fully expanded leaves.
Gas exchange measurements
The response of net CO
2 assimilation rate ( A) to intercellular
CO2 concentration (C i) was measured with an LI-6400XT gas
exchange system (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln, NE, USA) at a
PPFD of 1600 μmol photons m /C0 2 s/C0 1 and 30 °C as described in
Table S2. 1600 μmol photons m /C0 2 s/C0 1 PPFD was selected based
on preliminary analyses, which indicated that this intensity was
saturating for photosynthesis in all species. Leaf area was mea-
sured using I
MAGEJ (Schindelin et al., 2015). Linear regressions
were determined using the Python library S CIPY’s stats.linregress
function (Virtanen et al., 2020) through the lowest ﬁve C i values.
The CO 2 compensation point of A (ᴦ) was estimated as the
x-intercept of the linear regression, while carboxylation efﬁciency
(CE) was estimated as the slope of the linear regression. The CE
values were then normalized to A at saturating CO
2 (A1500). The
ratio A1500/A400 was used to determine the relative CO 2 satura-
tion at 400 μmol mol/C0 1.
δ13C analysis
δ13C of leaf starch was measured from living samples collected
on a weekend in early September with a gentle breeze (wind
speed of 10 –20 km h
/C0 1 on the Beaufort wind scale) sufﬁcient to
mix surface air with bulk atmosphere. Samples were collected
between 3 and 6 pm in a well-ventilated glasshouse. These condi-
tions served to maximize leaf starch content, reduce variation in
the source gas isotopic ratios, and minimize fossil fuel CO
2 con-
tributions from local trafﬁc. Glasshouse vents were kept partly
open for 48 h before sampling so that the difference between
indoor and outdoor CO
2 was consistently < 15 μmol mol/C0 1,a s
measured by two LI-6400XT machines. Leaf starch was used
instead of bulk leaf for δ
13C analysis both because accumulated
starch primarily represents a single photoperiod while bulk leaf
material reﬂects the entire development time, and because discri-
mination against
13C by postphotosynthetic processes can skew
δ13C values of bulk leaves by 1 –2‰, complicating interspecies
comparisons (Adachi et al., 2023). Samples were ﬂash-frozen in
liquid nitrogen and stored at /C0 80°C. Starch was extracted

enzymatically (Richter et al., 2009; Adachi et al., 2023), and
150 μl of extract per sample was evaporated in tin capsules
(model D1006; Elemental Microanalysis, Okehampton, UK).
δ
13C was also measured on 2 mg samples of dried leaf from 92
herbarium specimens of B. furcata, B. macra, and B. mitrata
(Table S3). The names for most of these specimens were con-
ﬁrmed by Kai Vollesen, the taxonomic authority for Blepharis
(Vollesen, 2000). All δ13C measurements were conducted by the
Washington State University Stable Isotope Laboratory ( www.
isotopes.wsu.edu). Monthly precipitation means were obtained
for all herbarium specimen collection locations from W ORLDCLIM
v.2 ( worldclim.org) and summed to annual totals from 1970 to
2000 using the R package geodata. Daily maximum and mini-
mum temperatures from 2010 to 2020 were obtained from
NASA POWER ( power.larc.nasa.gov) using the R package nasa-
power and used to calculate growing degree days (GDD) as the
sum of max((( T
max + Tmin)/2) /C0 10°C, 0) over all days.
Enzyme assays
Activity of Rubisco, PEP carboxy lase (PEPC), NADP-dependent
malate dehydrogenase (MDH), NAD malic enzyme (NAD-ME),
NADP malic enzyme (NADP-ME), aspartate aminotransferase
(AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and pyruvate phosphate
dikinase (PPDK) were assayed at 30 °C by coupling the rate of oxi-
dation or reduction of NAD(H) or NADP(H) measured at 340
nm (with a Hewlett–Packard mode 8452A diode array spectrophot-
ometer) to the enzyme activity of interest. Assay protocols followed
Ashton et al.( 1990)a n dK e y s&P a r r y( 1990), with modiﬁcations
b a s e do nt e s t i n ga n do t her literature (Matsuba et al., 1997;V o z n e -
senskaya et al., 2001;U e n o&S e n t o k u ,2006;O a k l e yet al., 2014;
Dever et al., 2015; Friesen & Sage, 2016;A d a c h i et al., 2023)
(Table S4). NAD-ME activity was assayed in C
4 and C 4/C0 species
only to conﬁrm that NADP-ME is the primary decarboxylase. PEP
carboxykinase (PCK) was not assayed because use of this decarboxy-
lase is rare in C
4 eudicots, particularly those in which NADP-ME is
the primary decarboxylase. Transcriptome data also support the
hypothesis that NADP-ME is the primary decarboxylase in
Blepharis,a sn oC 4 Blepharis species exhibited upregulation of
NAD-ME or PCK (Stata, 2023). Leaf samples were collected from
glasshouse-grown plants under bright conditions such that the
PPFD was near 1500 μmol m
/C0 2 s/C0 1, ﬂash-frozen in liquid N 2,a n d
stored at /C0 80°C until assayed. Samples were homogenized using
an electric drill-powered tissue grinder (model 358111; DWK Life
Science, Millville, NJ, USA) wi th 1 ml of extraction buffer per
square centimeter of leaf. All assays were conducted on the same
extract in the following sequence: PPDK, PEPC, NADP-ME,
NAD-ME (if performed), Rubisco, AST, ALT, and NADP-MDH.
Chl was quantiﬁed spectro photometrically (Arnon, 1949). Only
PPDK was found to lose activity over the time from extraction to
ﬁnal assay; hence, it was always run ﬁrst. NADP-MDH was always
run last as it requires incubation at a high concentration of DTT to
obtain maximum activity. All other enzymes showed stable activity.
D u et ol a c ko fd e t e c t a b l eN A D - M Ea c t i v i t yi nBlepharis species,
the NAD-ME assay was validated using leaf samples from the
known NAD-ME C
4 species Gynandropsis gynandra(Cleomaceae)
and Amaranthus retroﬂexus(Amaranthaceae), which were grown in
a glasshouse at the University of Toronto.
Phylotranscriptomic inference
Phylogenetic inferences were based on transcriptome assemblies
of live plants and short-read genomic DNA data for transcrip-
tome specimens and B. dhofarensis(Table S5). Leaf samples were
ﬂash-frozen and stored at /C0 80°C. RNA was extracted using
PureLink kits (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA)
and assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technol-
ogies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). cDNA libraries were constructed
using the NEBNext Ultra II kit (New England Biolabs, Ipswich,
MA, USA) and sequenced using the Illumina Novaseq 6000 plat-
form (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with paired-end 150-bp
reads by Berry Genomics ( berrygenomics.com). RNA-seq data
for ﬁve additional Acanthaceae outgroup species were down-
loaded from the NCBI SRA (Table S5). Reads were trimmed
based on quality using T
RIMMOMATIC (Bolger et al., 2014) with
minimum leading and trailing quality cutoffs of 30, a ﬁve-base
sliding window cutoff of 30, and a minimum length of 70 bp.
Transcriptome assembly, ortholog detection, and single-copy
ortholog processing were conducted as described by Adachi
et al.( 2023). Software tools and version information are provided
in Table S6 (Rice et al ., 2000; Suyama et al ., 2006;
Capella-Guti´errez et al., 2009; Grabherr et al., 2011; Katoh &
Standley, 2013; Zhang et al., 2018; Emms & Kelly, 2019; Kim
et al., 2019; Kozlov et al., 2019; Danecek et al., 2021). The cri-
teria for selecting low-copy orthogroups were a maximum of
eight missing taxa and a maximum of 10% of taxa with multiple
sequences permitted before an entire orthogroup was rejected. A
gap tolerance for alignment trimming of 0.8 was used. Following
this procedure, 5377 low-copy orthogroups were identiﬁed, of
which 3670 remained after fragment assembly and paralog
removal; from these, 2461 with alignment lengths between 500
and 2500 bp were selected for further analysis.
Short-read genomic DNA data were generated for herbarium
specimens, and B. dhofarensis (Table S5) was prepared using the
DNA Nanoball (DNB) protocol as previously described (Liu
et al., 2024) and read-map pileups for reference-based assembly
were generated as described in Adachi et al.( 2023;s o f t w a r ed e t a i l s
in Table S6). A Python script was used to generate reference-based
assemblies as follows: at each site in a pileup, either the most abun-
dant base in the mapped reads was selected, or an N was called if
three or fewer reads mapped to that site, or if the frequency of the
second most abundant base was > 75% of that of the top base,
indicating either heterozygosity or multiple paralogs. If > 1% of
sites were considered heterozygous in this manner, the entire
sequence was rejected due to the likelihood of paralogs.
After ﬁnal ﬁltering to remove orthogroups with more than
eight missing taxa, 2138 orthogroups were selected for phyloge-
netic analysis, representing 2.78 megabases. Phylogenetic analysis
based on concatenated supermatrix and multispecies coalescent
approaches was conducted as described by Adachi et al.( 2023;
software details in Table S6). All taxa and assembly methodolo-
gies are listed in Table S5.

Leaf microscopy
Qualitative features of leaf anatomy and ultrastructural features
of BS cells were assessed from leaf tissue sampled halfway up the
leaf and halfway between the midrib and leaf margin of the most
recently expanded leaf. Tissue samples were taken between
30 min and 2 h from the start of the photoperiod, ﬁxed initially
with 1% glutaraldehyde (v/v), 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde, post-
ﬁxed in osmium tetroxide, and embedded in Araldite as described
previously (Khoshravesh et al., 2017). Light micrographs were
taken using a Ziess Axiophot equipped with a DP71 Olympus
camera and Olympus CellSens image software (Advanced Micro-
scopy Techniques, Woburn MA, USA). A Philips 201 transmis-
sion electron microscope (TEM) equipped with an Advantage
HR camera system (Advanced Microscopy Techniques) was used
to capture TEM micrographs. To ensure selection of representa-
tive images, qualitative observations of leaf anatomy and ultra-
structure were made on leaves from three different plants.
Observations of BS ultrastructure were made on ﬁve BS cells
from one leaf each from three different plants.
Statistical analysis
A principal component analysis (PCA) and k-means clustering
were conducted using all collected physiological data as features
(Tables S7–S9) using the P
YTHON module Scikit-learn (MacQu-
een, 1967; Pedregosa et al., 2011). Because datasets frequently
lacked normal distributions, analysis of variation was conducted
using the Kruskal –Wallis nonparametric test (Kruskal &
Wallis, 1952) followed by Conover post hoc tests for statistical
groupings (Conover & Iman, 1979). Linear regression analyses
and A/C
i curve ﬁtting were conducted in P YTHON using SciPy
(Virtanen et al., 2020). To visually simplify numerous A/Ci
curves, data were ﬁtted to the function y = (P1x)/(x + P2) + P3
using the SciPy.optimize.curve_ﬁt function with P 1,P 2, and P 3
as tunable parameters. Signiﬁcance of linear regressions was
assessed using the Wald test as implemented in the SciPy.stat-
s.linregress function. Regressions are presented with residual
bootstrapping showing uncertainty or variability in the regression
and prediction intervals within which 95% of new observations
are expected to occur. Sample sizes for all analyses are presented
in the associated ﬁgure and table legends.
Results
PCA and phenotypic classiﬁcation
To objectively categorize the unstudied photosynthetic diversity
in Blepharis, we ﬁrst conducted a PCA using our physiological
data (Tables S7–S9). Principal components 1 and 2 explained
79% and 7% of total variation, respectively, and discrete clusters
were identiﬁed corresponding to C
3,C 2,C 4/C0 , and C 4 taxa
(Fig. 1a). The machine learning algorithm k-means (MacQu-
een, 1967) supported six distinct phenotypic categories including
C3,C 2,C 4/C0 , and C 4.
There are also two single-sample clusters: a Blepharis mitrata
accession from Graaff-Reinet, South Africa, which is C 2 but with
a low, C 4-like Γ and elevated C 4 enzyme activity, which we cate-
gorize as C 2+; and Blepharis gazensis,aC 4 species with atypically
high ALT, AST, and NADP-MDH activities (Fig. 1a, dotted
ellipses; Tables S7–S9). Reducing the number of k-means clusters
had the following effects: with ﬁve clusters, B. mitrata Graaff-

Reinet joined the C 2 cluster; with four, B. gazensis joined the C 4
cluster; and with three, the C 4 and C 4/C0 clusters merged (not
shown). PCA variables plotted as vectors (Fig. 1b) show that PC1
is primarily inﬂuenced by C 4 cycle enzyme activities, δ13C, and
Γ, while PC2 is most inﬂuenced by Γ, stomatal conductance ( gs),
and Rubisco activity. The phenotypic classiﬁcations established
here were used for all subsequent statistical analyses (Tables 1–2,
S2, S7–S9).
Photosynthetic gas exchange and leaf starch δ13C analyses
Mean A/Ci curves for representative C 3,C 2,C 4/C0 , and C 4
Blepharis species illustrate the range of photosynthetic responses
to C i (Fig. 2a). For improved visibility, ﬁtted curves, both raw
and normalized, were generated for the full A/Ci dataset (Fig. 2b,
c). C 2 species show responses similar to those of C 3 species but
with lower Γ.C 4 species have Γ values near zero and sharp initial
responses saturating at 200 –300 μmol CO 2 mol/C0 1 air (Fig. 2b).
All three B. furcata (C4/C0 ) accessions have normalized responses
intermediate between the C 4 and non-C 4 curves (Fig. 2c). Nor-
malized CE values for B. furcata are statistically intermediate
between C 4 and non-C 4 species, while higher A1500/A400 indi-
cates CO 2 saturation occurs at higher C i than in C 4 species
(Tables 1, S7;F i g .S2).
Blepharis leaf starch δ13C values from living specimens showed
distinct variation between photosynthetic groups (Tables 2, S7).
C3 and C 4 groups had typical values of /C0 27.7 and 12.9‰,
respectively. The C 2 mean was 0.8‰ more negative than C 3 spe-
cies, while the C 4/C0 mean of /C0 17.5‰ was intermediate between
C3 and C 4 values. Gas exchange metrics were plotted against leaf
starch δ13C to evaluate their relationship with the strength of C 4
metabolism as indicated by less negative δ13C values (Fig. 3;
Table S7). Less negative δ13C values indicate C 4 cycle engage-
ment because PEPC has lower discrimination against 13Ct h a n
Rubisco (Monson et al., 1988; von Caemmerer, 1992). This is
evident in the linear relationship ( R2 = 0.84) between δ13C and
PEPC activity, especially in the intermediate C 4/C0 types (Fig. 3f).
C2 species show a marked reduction in Γ and a small but signiﬁ-
cant shift to more negative δ13C values compared with C 3 plants
(Fig. 3b; Table 1). The C 2+ Graaff-Reinet population of
B. mitratahas a low, C 4-like Γ but a C 3-like δ13C value, in con-
trast to the typically C 4 values in the two Pofadder accessions of
B. mitrata (Table S7). All C 4/C0 B. furcata accessions have C 4 Γ
and intermediate δ13C values (Fig. 3b; Table S7). Blepharis fur-
cata accessions have higher A1500/A400 and C i/Ca values and
lower normalized CE, compared with fully C 4 species (Fig. 3b–d;
Tables 1, S7); these characters do not signiﬁcantly differ between
C2 and C 3 species (Table 1). Stomatal conductance ( gs) was

generally lower in C 4 and C 4/C0 species than in C 3 and C 2 plants
(Fig. 3e; Table 1), resulting in higher intrinsic water use efﬁ-
ciency ( A400/gs; Fig. S2). Blepharis dhofarensis (C3) showed low
Ci/Ca (0.59) and high A400/gs (80 μmol mol/C0 1) driven by very
low gs, which probably explains the more positive δ13C values
observed in this arborescent arid-land species than in the other
C
3 Blepharis species (Table S7).
Leaf biochemistry
All C 4 and C 4/C0 Blepharis species showed high activities of
NADP-ME (Tables 2, S8–S9; Fig. S2). NAD-ME activity was
undetectable in Blepharis, whereas rates for the known NAD-ME
species G. gynandra(Cleomaceae) and A. retroﬂexus (Amarantha-
ceae) were 84.2 /C6 4.3 and 36.9 /C6 5.1 mmol mol chl
/C0 1 s/C0 1, respec-
tively (mean /C6 SE; n = 3), demonstrating the assay worked well.
Negligible NAD-ME activity was also observed for B. ciliaris,
despite this species previously being identiﬁed as NAD-ME by
western blot analysis (Akhani et al., 2008). We suspect that the
NADP-ME antibody used by Akhani et al.( 2008), which was
raised against Zea mays, likely had had low binding afﬁnity for
the Blepharis NADP-ME, resulting in lack of detection. The
activities of examined C
4 cycle enzymes were positively correlated
with PEPC activity, while Rubisco was negatively correlated
(Fig. 4). Among C
3 and C 2 species, all enzyme rates except
PPDK correlate positively with PEPC (Figs 4, S3). C 2 species
also showed higher average PEPC, NADP-ME, AST, and ALT
activities than C 3 species (Table 2; Figs S2–S3). The C 4 species
B. gazensis exhibited ALT, AST, and NADP-MDH rates far
exceeding those in other C 4 Blepharis species (Fig. 4a–c;
Tables S8, S9 ). Notably, we observed the regressions through the
C3 to C 2 activity data for ALT vs PEPC, AST vs PEPC, and
MDH vs PEPC had steeper slopes than the corresponding regres-
sions through all the data, while the regression slopes for Rubisco
vs PEPC had opposite directions in the C
3 to C 2 data relative to
the C 3 to C 4 data (Figs 4, S3). We hypothesize these shifts reﬂect
a change in selection imperatives during C 3 to C 2 evolution, vs
C2 to C4 evolution.

All B. furcata (C4/C0 ) accessions showed C 4 enzyme rates com-
parable to or lower than fully C 4 species and higher Rubisco
activity similar to C 3 and C 2 species (Table 2). C 2 species had
lower activities of C 4 cycle enzymes than C 4/C0 and C 4 species;
however, PEPC, NADP-ME, AST, and ALT were elevated rela-
tive to C 3 species (Table 2). A similar increase was not observed
for PPDK or NADP-MDH, although PEPC and NADP-MDH
rates were correlated in C
3 and C 2 species (Table 2; Figs 4, S3).
In the Graaff-Reinet accession of B. mitrata, activities of PEPC,
NADP-ME, PPDK, and NADP-MDH were elevated relative to
C
3 and C 2 species, supporting its designation as a C 2+ species
but were well below those of C 4+ and C 4 species including the
C4 B. mitrata species from Pofadder, SA (Tables S8, S9). The
Graaff-Reinet accession of B. mitrata exhibited higher rates of
PEPC, NADP-MDH, NADP-ME, and PPDK than any of the
C
3 or C 2 species (Fig. S2; Tables S8, S9). Statistical grouping for
enzyme rates on a Chl basis and a leaf area basis was similar,
except for minor changes in AST and ALT (Tables 2, S8, S9).
Leaf anatomy and bundle sheath cell ultrastructure
Qualitative leaf anatomical patterns in Blepharis follow a similar
pattern to those reported for other C
3, proto-Kranz, C 2,C 4/C0 ,
and C 4 eudicots (Figs 5–7, S4; McKown & Dengler, 2007;
Muhaidat et al., 2011; Sage et al., 2011; Leung et al., 2024).
While Blepharis species may differ in having unifacial or bifacial
leaves, BS cells form a complete sheath around the vascular tissue
in all species examined (Figs 5, S4). The BS cells of B. leendertziae
(C
3; sect. Scorpioidea) and B. spinifex(C3; sect. Acanthodium) are
typical of C 3 plants, with few mitochondria and chloroplasts,
most of which are localized to the BS periphery (Panels a and b
in Figs 5–7). In contrast, BS cells in B. subvolubilis (functionally
C
3) have centripetal aggregates of chloroplasts and mitochondria
(Panel c in Figs 5–7). This characteristic is a key indicator of the
proto-Kranz phenotype identiﬁed as an early stage of C 3-to-C2
evolution (Sage et al., 2012). The BS cells of the C 2 species
B. diversispina and B. macra have pronounced centripetal aggre-
gates of chloroplasts and mitochondria, with some chloroplasts
also positioned along the outer periphery (Panels d and e in
Figs 5–7). Fig. 7(d,e) shows a high magniﬁcation of the close
positioning present between mitochondria and chloroplasts in
the centripetal aggregate of organelles in the BS, which is a char-
acteristic of C
2 species. The BS cells of B. furcata(C4/C0 ) resemble
C2 species but have fewer chloroplasts and no mitochondria in
the outer periphery and a larger centripetal aggregation of orga-
nelles (Panel f in Figs 5–7). The Graaff-Reinet (C 2+) and Pofad-
der (C 4) accessions of B. mitrata differ; in that, the C 4 accession
has fewer mitochondria, and all organelles are centripetally aggre-
gated (Panels g and h in Figs 5–7). In both the C
4 B. mitrata
Pofadder accession and the C 4 species B. linariifolia, the centripe-
tal aggregations of organelles have closely spaced, often enlarged
and/or elongated chloroplasts, in a pattern often observed in
NADP-ME C
4 eudicots (Panels h and i in Figs 5–7; Sage
et al., 2014).
Most C 4 Blepharis exhibit typical NADP-ME C 4 BS ultra-
structure, with few mitochondria and many enlarged chloroplasts
with fewer and smaller thylakoid grana stacks (Fig. 5h,i). In con-
trast to other C 4 Blepharis, BS cells of B. gazensis have abundant
mitochondria and prominent thylakoid grana (Fig. 8). These dif-
ferences, coupled with high AST, ALT, and NADP-MDH activ-
ities (Tables S8, S9), demonstrate functional divergence in B.
gazensis, highlighted by its distinct clustering in the PCA and k-
means plot (Fig. 1a).
δ13C analysis of herbarium samples
Fisher et al.( 2015) reported δ13C values indicative of C 4- pheno-
types for B. furcata and B. macra; however, our live B. macra
plants exhibited a C 2 phenotype with low C 4 cycle activity. Addi-
tionally, we found variation in live accessions of B. mitrata, with
the Pofadder accessions exhibiting full C 4 photosynthesis while
the Graaff-Reinet accession has a C 2+ phenotype. Given this
possibility of photosynthetic variation within these species, we
measured bulk leaf δ
13C from 92 herbarium specimens of B. fur-
cata, B. macra, and B. mitrata collected across their geographic
ranges and compared them with previous Blepharis C3 and C 4
values presented in Fisher et al.( 2015); Fig. 9; Table S3. B.
mitrata δ13C ranged from C 4 (/C0 13‰) to C 3 values ( /C0 28‰),
with a bimodal distribution. δ13C ranged from borderline C 4
(/C0 15‰) to higher C 3 (/C0 24‰) in B. furcata and from border-
line C 4 (/C0 16‰) to typical C 3 (/C0 27‰) in B. macra(Fig. 9). We
found a signiﬁcant difference between climate parameters asso-
ciated with B. mitrata specimens with C
4-like δ13C( < /C0 20‰)
vs non-C 4 δ13C( > /C0 20‰); and specimens with C 4 δ13C values
associated with warmer and drier habitats (as indicated by greater
growing degree days and lower mean annual precipitation,
respectively; Fig. S5).
Phylogenetic analysis
Transcriptome-based phylogenetic inference produced a robust
phylogeny with 100% support at most nodes after removing
three hybrid samples (Fig. 10; Notes S1). Both the genus
Blepharis and sect. Acanthodium were resolved as monophyletic,
except for B. dhofarensis. This arborescent species was previously
resolved outside of Blepharis (McDade et al., 2005) and likely
warrants reclassiﬁcation within Acanthus or as its own genus.
Only minor conﬂicts were observed between the coalescent and
concatenation trees (Figs 10, S6).
Based on our phylogeny, we denote six distinct clades in
Blepharis sect. Acanthodium. The C
3 species B. spinifex and
B. procumbens comprise Acanthodium I, which branches basally
within sect. Acanthodium. Next, Acanthodium II comprises C 3
and C 2 taxa plus the unusual C 4 species B. gazensis. Within this
clade, B. subvolubilis exhibits proto-Kranz anatomy (Fig. 5c),
with similar BS ultrastructure observed in B. stainbankiae and B.
breyeri (Stata, 2023). Analysis of DNA from herbarium samples
also places Blepharis espinosaand B. meyeriin this clade; these are
both inferred to be C 3 or C 2 based on δ13C (Fisher et al., 2015).
The remaining clades, Acanthodium III through VI, lack con-
ﬁrmed C 3 species, spanning a range of phenotypes from C 2 to
C4. Acanthodium III contains the C 2 species B. gigantea ,

B. pruinosa, and B. ferox, and Acanthodium IV represents a C 4
lineage comprised of B. asperaand B. serrulata. Blepharis furcata,
B. macra,a n d B. mitrata together form Acanthodium V; this
clade is particularly noteworthy for its diversity spanning from
C2 to C 4 phenotypes (Fig. 9). Phylogenetic placement and δ13C
(Table S3) indicate that the Werger 325 specimen originally clas-
siﬁed as B. furcata is likely a misidentiﬁed B. mitrata. Acantho-
dium VI comprises all remaining fully C 4 Blepharis species and
corresponds with the Ciliaris group, which has expanded geogra-
phically well beyond the southern African center of diversity for
sect. Acanthodium, into northern Africa, the Middle East, and
northwestern India (Vollesen, 2000; Fisher et al., 2015).
Discussion
Overview of photosynthetic diversity in Blepharis
This study reveals rich photosynthetic diversity spanning a range
of phenotypes from C 3 to C 4 in Blepharis sect. Acanthodium.
Based on anatomical observations of herbarium materials, Fisher
et al .( 2015) suggested that all members of Blepharis sect.
Acanthodium are C 4,C 4/C0 ,o rC 2, with a C 2 common ancestor
and the closest C 3 sisters being more distantly related infrageneric
sections. In our live collection of 42 accessions from 28 species,
we demonstrate C
3–C4 intermediate phenotypes in 12 species or
populations of Blepharis. We also identiﬁed ﬁve functionally C 3
species in section Acanthodium, including three that exhibit
proto-Kranz ultrastructure in the BS. PCA and k-means cluster-
ing delineated six distinct functional groups based on the aggre-
gated physiological data. Two of these are monospeciﬁc: the
B. mitrata Graaff-Reinet accession with a strong C
2+ phenotype
and the atypical C 4 species B. gazensis.
The other clusters represent ﬁve C 3 species, eight C 2 species,
one C 4/C0 species, and 11 C 4 species. Moreover, our δ13C survey
of nearly 100 herbarium specimens of B. furcata, B. macra, and
B. mitrata showed each species includes populations that span
the δ13C range from C 3-like to fully C 4, with numerous acces-
sions in the /C0 22 to /C0 16‰ range corresponding to the C 4/C0 phy-
siology. Blepharis sect. Acanthodium thus spans a wide range of
C3–C4 intermediate phenotypes, with notable diversity in the
underexplored C 2+ and C 4/C0 conditions representing the later
stages of C 4 evolution.
Compared with C 3 species, fully C 4 Blepharis have ᴦ values
near zero, elevated CE, and positively shifted δ13C, driven by
strong C 4 cycle engagement, while C 2 species are character-
ized primarily by lower ᴦ (14.9 /C6 4.7 μmol mol/C0 1) than C 3
species (55.3 /C6 2.9 μmol mol/C0 1). C 2 species lack the elevated
CE and positively shifted δ13C values observed in C 4 and
C4/C0 species, largely because they lack a strong C 4 cycle that
is well-integrated with the PCR cycle in BS tissue (Monson
& Rawsthorne, 2000). δ
13C in most C 2 Blepharis species is
instead shifted negatively compared with C 3 species, reﬂecting

the double discrimination against 13CO2 by BS Rubisco (von
Caemmerer, 1989, 1992). The Graaff-Reinet B. mitrata acces-
sion exhibits a C 2+ phenotype characterized by lower ᴦ and
higher activities of PEPC, NADP-MDH, NADP-ME,
and PPDK than other C 2 or C 3 species, despite having C 3-
like δ13C and CE data indicating little C 4PCR cycle integra-
tion.
Based on intermediate δ13C of herbarium specimens, Fisher
et al.( 2015) hypothesized a C 4/C0 phenotype occurs in B. furcata
and B. macra. The accession of B. macrastudied here exhibited a
C2 phenotype, but broader δ13C analysis of herbarium specimens
indicates intraspeciﬁc C 2–C4 variation exists in this species (will
be discussed later). Conversely, high C 4 cycle enzyme activity,
elevated CE, lower ᴦ, and positively shifted δ13C relative to C 3
and C 2 species demonstrate the presence of a strong, integrated
C4 cycle in all three live accessions of B. furcata. However, com-
pared with C 4 Blepharis, lower CE and PEPC activity, coupled
with higher Rubisco activity and A1500/A400, indicate that C 3
photosynthesis occurs in M cells in B. furcata, similar to what has
been observed in the C 4/C0 species Flaveria brownii (Monson
et al., 1987; Cheng et al., 1988; Adachi et al., 2023). A stepwise
model of C 4 evolution initially developed for Flaveria hypothe-
sizes that restriction of Rubisco to the BS evolves late, after C 4-
PCR cycle integration (Sage et al., 2012). The patterns observed
in the C 2+ and C 4/C0 accessions of Blepharis provide compelling
evidence for the broader relevance of the Flaveria model of C 4
evolution.
While all other C 4 Blepharis species have a typical
NADP-ME C 4 phenotype, B. gazensis exhibits BS ultrastruc-
ture and aminotransferase activities commonly associated
with the NADME C
4 pathway. Despite these observations,
we detected high NADP-ME activity and no NADME
activity in this species. BS cells in B. gazensis have abundant
mitochondria and prominent thylakoid grana. Because

abundant grana indicate elevated levels of photosystem II
and NADP + reduction (Edwards & Walker, 1983), these
results indicate B. gazensis utilizes aspartate over malate as
the main C 4 transport metabolite, as occurs in NAD-ME
C4 species. Unlike malate, aspartate does not carry reducing
power, and C 4 plants that transport aspartate require more
photosystem II activity in BS chloroplasts to meet the redox
needs of the PCR cycle (Edwards & Walker, 1983;F u r -
bank, 2011). The elevated rates of AST and ALT in
B. gazensis are consistent with this interpretation (Drincov-
ich et al., 2011). The abundant BS mitochondria are best
explained by the use of mitochondrial isoforms of AST and
ALT (Stata, 2023). This type of aspartate-dependent
NADP-ME C
4 pathway has been hypo thesized as feasible
but never previously observed and may represent either a
transitional stage during the evolution of a more typical
NADP-ME C
4 pathway or an uncommon yet stable evolu-
tionary endpoint.

from /C0 14.6 to /C0 23.0‰ and /C0 16.4 to /C0 27.1‰ in B. macra.
Together, their values form a gradient from non-C 4 to fully C 4
δ13C values, with the former likely representing C 2 populations
based on phylogenetic distance from C 3 taxa. Most B. macra
populations have δ13C values consistent with minimal C 4 cycle
activity, but C 4/C0 values occur in three populations.
B. mitratawas classiﬁed as C 4 by Fisher et al.( 2015) based on
δ13C in two specimens; however, we found evidence of variability
in this species as well. While two live accessions are C 4, the
Graaff-Reinet accession exhibits a C 2+ phenotype. We therefore
included 66 B. mitrataherbarium specimens in our δ13C survey.
Of these, 28 have non-C 4 δ13C values ( /C0 21 to /C0 30‰), while
35 have C 4 values ( /C0 13 to /C0 16‰), with the latter averaging c.
1‰ more negative than C 4 values from Fisher et al.( 2015).
Eight specimens had intermediate values ( /C0 16 to /C0 22‰), con-
sistent with C 4/C0 physiology. Non-C 4 specimens were predomi-
nantly collected below or along South Africa’s Great Escarpment,
whereas C
4 specimens occurred throughout the range except in
the southeastern extreme (Fig. 9). Together, δ13C data from
B. furcata, B. macra,a n d B. mitrataindicate that C 4 evolution is
active and ongoing in these three species, with a gradient of phe-
notypes spanning the C 2 to C4 transition.
The phylogenetic context of intermediate phenotypes
The evolutionary signiﬁcance of the photosynthetic diversity in
Blepharis is reinforced by our phylogeny, which supports the
interpretation of intermediate phenotypes as extant stages of C 4
evolution. The fully C 3 species in sect. Acanthodium, B. procum-
bens and B. spinifex, form a clade, which we designate Acantho-
dium I. The basal-branching position of this clade is consistent
with the hypothesis of a C
3 ancestral state for sect. Acanthodium,
extending the range of evolutionary steps present compared with
the C
2 ancestral state hypothesized by Fisher et al.( 2015). A dis-
tal clade designated Acanthodium VI comprises most of the fully
C
4 taxa in this study. The known C 4 species absent from this
study, B. glinusand B. scindica, likely belong to this clade as well,
based on the phylogeny of Fisher et al.( 2015). Between these
clades, the Acanthodium II through V clades comprise groups of
intermediates and phylogenetically distinct C
4 and C4/C0 lineages.
The phylogenetic placement of C 3–C4 intermediate pheno-
types in Blepharis highlights their roles as transitional states dur-
ing C 4 evolution. Apart from B. gazensis, the Acanthodium II
and III clades reﬂect the C 3 →proto-Kranz → C2 transitions.
Proto-Kranz Blepharis species occupy phylogenetically intermedi-
ate positions branching sister to C 3 and C 2 species, a pattern also
observed in Flaveria (Sage et al., 2013). This supports a model of
C4 evolution in which proto-Kranz anatomy precedes the C 2
phenotype, which then serves as a necessary intermediate to C 4
photosynthesis. Although C 2 photosynthesis is hypothesized to
be an essential stage during C 4 evolution, the proto-Kranz and
C2 states may also arise from hybridization between C 3 and C 4
species (Kadereit et al., 2017; Tefarikis et al., 2022; Alvarenga
et al., 2025). However, phylogenetic network analysis demon-
strates that C 2 physiology in Blepharis primarily arose through
vertical evolution, supporting the hypothesis that the C 2 state is
essential during C 4 evolution (Notes S1). The unusual biochem-
istry and BS ultrastructure of B. gazensis is reﬂected in its phylo-
genetic distance from other C 4 Blepharis species, nested in the
Acanthodium II clade.
Given the lack of evidence for reversion from a C 4 state (Chris-
tin et al., 2010; Ingram et al., 2011; Oakley et al., 2014), we
identify ﬁve putative evolutionary origins of the C 4 cycle in
Blepharis (Fig. 10). However, given the evidence for a C 4 cycle in
at least some populations of all taxa in the Acanthodium IV, V,
and VI clades, it is possible that the C
4 cycle emerged in the com-
mon ancestor of these clades, with intraspeciﬁc variation persist-
ing within B. furcata, B. macra,a n d B. mitrata. Assuming ﬁve C
4
origins, Blepharis would be the leading genus for C 4 evolution,
exceeding the two to three independent C 4 clades suggested for
Alloteropsis, Flaveria, Neurachne, and Portulaca (Sage, 2016).
Blepharis demonstrates that complex trait evolution can be highly
dynamic within genera.
C4 evolution and complex trait assembly
Blepharis supports and extends the stepwise model of C 4 evolution
developed in Flaveria and other C 3–C4 transitional lineages
(Monson & Rawsthorne, 2000;S a g e et al., 2012). C 3 and proto-
Kranz species in Blepharis sect. Acanthodium inhabit hot, dry, and
weakly monsoonal climates where photorespiration is high during
the growing season (Vollesen, 2000;F i s h e ret al., 2015;S a g eet al.,
2018). Photorespiration is widely regarded as a central driver for
C
4 evolution, although this hypothesis is not ubiquitously sup-
ported (Lundgren & Christin, 2017). High photorespiration cre-
ates challenges for C 3 plants beyond restricting photosynthetic
efﬁciency (Ehleringer et al., 1997; Busch et al., 2013). Cleavage of
photorespiratory glycine produces ammonia and CO 2,b o t hv u l -
nerable to diffusional loss, with ammonia loss being particularly
problematic as it depletes nitrogen, a frequently limiting element.
Localizing the release of these molecules to the BS enables plants
to more effectively recapture them and thus could enable physiolo-
gical and structural modiﬁcations that lead to C
2 and later C 4
photosynthesis (Mallmann et al., 2014).
C4 cycle enzymes are proposed to support C 2 photosynthesis
by facilitating the reﬁxation and shuttling of photorespiratory
nitrogen from BS to M tissues (Mallmann et al., 2014), and their
upregulation for these functions may facilitate the assembly of
the full C
4 cycle. As the C 4 cycle comes together and begins to
supply CO 2 to the PCR cycle in the BS, a positive shift in δ13C
occurs, as has been observed in the C 2+ species Flaveria ramosis-
sima and to a lesser degree in F. ﬂoridana (Monson et al., 1986;
Edwards & Ku, 1987;K u et al., 1991; Alonso-Cantabrana &
von Caemmerer, 2016). In contrast, most C 2 species in Blepharis
do not show signiﬁcant shifts in δ13C from typical C 3 values,
indicating little if any C 4-PCR cycle integration. This is surpris-
ing since in Flaveria and Blepharis intermediates, the activity of a
number of C 4 cycle enzymes increases in concert with increases
in PEPC activity, which might indicate gradual upregulation of a
C4 cycle. If upregulation of C 4 cycle enzymes has little effect on
net carbon gain or δ13C, then what purpose may it serve?
Mallmann et al.( 2014) and Adachi et al.( 2023) hypothesize that

the function of the partial upregulation of the C 4 cycle in C 2 spe-
cies is not to enhance carbon ﬁxation but to promote reﬁxation
of photorespired NH
3 in the BS cell and facilitate rapid return
of photorespiratory N to M cells. High rates of photorespiration
could lead to excessive loss of NH 3 via diffusive efﬂux unless it is
rapidly reﬁxed. The release of photorespiratory NH 3 in the BS
helps trap it for reassimilation. However, the product of NH 3
reassimilation is glutamate, and establishing a high concentration
in BS cells to support rapid diffusion back to M cells may lead to
feedback inhibition of glutamate synthase, slowing N reassimila-
tion and leading to NH
3 loss. This can be avoided by transamina-
tion of glutamate to alanine (via ALT) or aspartate (via AST),
which diffuse to M cells along their own concentration gradients
(Adachi et al., 2023). PEPC could be upregulated to produce car-
bon skeletons for rapid alanine or aspartate production (Mal-
lmann et al., 2014). Mean ALT and AST activities in Blepharis
are 40% greater in C
2 than in C 3 species, and linear regressions
between PEPC and both ALT and AST activities in the C 3 and
C2 species exhibited steeper positive slopes than those between
PEPC and other C 4 cycle enzymes. We interpret this as evidence
of coordinated upregulation of ALT, AST, and PEPC, beginning
in functionally C 3 species. Flaveria exhibits a similar steep rise of
ALT and AST activities correlated with PEPC activity in C 3 and
C2 species, leading to greater ALT and AST activities in C 2 than
in C 3 species (Adachi et al., 2023). C 2 Tribulus species (Zygo-
phyllaceae) also show greater ALT and AST activities than C 3
species (Leung et al., 2024). Together, these ﬁndings support the
hypothesis that photorespiratory nitrogen scavenging is the pri-
mary driver of proto-Kranz and C 2 evolution, and by extension,
C4 evolution, rather than carbon scavenging as hypothesized over
a decade ago (Sage et al., 2012).
At the other end of the C 3–C4 phenotypic spectrum, the
Acanthodium V clade comprising B. furcata, B. macra,a n d
B. mitrataexhibits substantial variation spanning C 2 to C4 pheno-
types. This diversity presents an unparalleled opportunity to
resolve uncertainty surrounding the later steps in C
4 evolution and
their geographic and climatological context. For example, the
Great Escarpment of South Africa is a geological feature that
extends across southernmost Africa and separates coastal regions
from the drier, elevated central plateau in the continental interior
(Fig. 7). B. furcata, B. macra,a n d B. mitrataare distributed across
the central plateau, while B. mitrataextends further south to below
the Great Escarpment (Vollesen, 2000). While C
4 specimens of B.
mitrata were collected across the species’ range, nearly all of the 28
specimens with non-C 4 δ13C values were collected below or along
the Great Escarpment, indicating that C 4 genotypes have expanded
geographic and ecological ranges relative to C 2 genotypes, similar
to patterns observed in Alloteropsis (Lundgren et al., 2015;S o t e l o
et al., 2024). B. mitrataspecimens with more C 4-like δ13Cv a l u e s
were also associated with signiﬁcantly warmer, drier habitats than
those with non-C
4 δ13C values (Fig. S5), indicating ecological
niche separation as often described for C 4 vs C3 species (Ehleringer
et al., 1997). The bimodal δ13C distribution in B. mitrataindicates
that gene ﬂow between C 4 and non-C 4 populations is reduced,
such that C 4 evolution in B. mitratamay be linked to partial allo-
patric speciation; for example, genes with large effects on C 4
physiology could function as barrier loci if interbreeding between
C
4 and non-C 4 individuals reduces ﬁtness (Ravinet et al., 2017).
In contrast, B. furcataand B. macraeach exhibit continuous δ13C
variation from non-C 4 to fully C 4, with no discernible geographic
differences in δ13C values across their ranges in northwestern
South Africa and southwestern Namibia (Vollesen, 2000). Closer
examination of the habitat distribution of phenotypes of Acantho-
dium V species will be needed to determine how climate and geo-
graphy inﬂuence C
4 evolution, a prospect made possible by the
diverse character states in this clade. The photosynthetic pathway
variation in these three species additionally opens the prospect of
within-species genetic crossing and population genomic studies,
which up until now have only been possible in Alloteropsis (Bian-
coni et al., 2022; Alenazi et al., 2024).
Conclusion
Blepharis sect. Acanthodium includes greater photosynthetic
diversity than previously hypothesized, spanning a phenotypic
and phylogenetic gradient from C
3 to C 4 photosynthesis. Inter-
mediate character states include proto-Kranz, numerous C 2 spe-
cies, and a deﬁnitive C 4/C0 phenotype previously only reported in
Flaveria. A novel, predominantly aspartate-shuttling NADP-ME
C4 pathway occurs in B. gazensis, a phylogenetically isolated
monospeciﬁc C 4 lineage.
Intraspeciﬁc diversity spanning the gap from C 2 to C 4 photo-
synthesis is demonstrated in each of B. furcata, B. macra, and
B. mitrata, presenting a remarkable opportunity to address major
questions of late-stage C 4 evolution. Numerous additional inter-
mediates likely exist, as this study examined only half of all sect.
Acanthodium species. Blepharis thus represents a dynamic system
to provide new insights, particularly into how the C 4 pathway
has been assembled from an ancestral C 2 state. Parallel study of
Blepharis and other highly informative C 3-to-C4 transitional
lineages will yield further insight into how a trait as complex as
C
4 photosynthesis can evolve with such remarkable frequency.
