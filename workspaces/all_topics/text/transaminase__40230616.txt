Achillea wilhelmsii (AW), a plant rich in ﬂavonoids, including lutein, apigenin, rutin, and phenolic compounds with antioxidant,
antibacterial, and antifungal properties, is used in traditional medicine. In this study, the impact of AW extract on the growth, immune
response, and biochemical indices of rainbow trout ( Oncorhynchus mykiss) was investigated. Over 8 weeks, ﬁsh were fed diets supple-
mented with varying concentrations of AW extract (0%,0 . 5%,1 %,o r2 %). No signiﬁcant differences were observed in growth performance,
glucose levels, or key enzymes such as lactic acid dehydrogenase, alanine transaminase, or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) between the
AW-supplemented groups and the control group. However,ﬁsh that received AW supplementation showed signiﬁcantly higher levels of
total serum protein, lysozyme activity, superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity, and immunoglobulin M (IgM). Moreover, the AW-fed groups
exhibited lower mortality after exposure to Yersinia ruckeri. In conclusion, AW supplementation could enhance immune function in
rainbow trout and decrease mortality after exposure toY. ruckeri. Therefore, using this plant (1% and 2%) in aquaculture could be justiﬁed
as a means to increase resistance to pathogens and improve the immune system performance of ﬁsh.

1. Introduction
The aquaculture industry has grown signi ﬁcantly in recent
decades due to the increasing global demand for sustainable
protein sources. Rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss)i sh i g h l y
valued in aquaculture due to its impressive growth rate,
resilience to stress, favorable taste, and economic viability, mak-
ing it an ideal candidate for high -density aquaculture systems
[1, 2]. Rainbow trout is one of the most important cold-water
ﬁsh species farmed in Iran. Its adaptability to Iran ’s climatic
conditions and favorable growth rate have contributed to its
success in aquaculture. In addition, its high consumer
Wiley

https://doi.org/10.1155/anu/2360780
acceptance has made it a valuable species for cultivation in
intensive and semi-intensive aquaculture systems. Accord-
ing to statistics from the Iranian Fisheries Organization, its
annual production is reported to be 200,000 tons. Thus,
compliance with food hygiene, welfare conditions, and
safety standards is essential to produce a healthy product
[3]. Moreover, cultivation in crowded conditions can be stress-
ful for ﬁsh. Exposure to stressors can suppress ﬁsh’s immune
systems and increase their susceptibility to infectious agents
and pathogens. Furthermore, disease outbreaks in farmed ﬁsh
remain a signi ﬁcant challenge, leading to signi ﬁcant ﬁnancial
losses and sometimes even bankruptcy for investors in this
ﬁeld [4, 5]. Aquaculture farmers have traditionally relied on
antibiotics and chemical treatments to manage these diseases
and reduce the associated challenges. Although these methods
may be effective in the short term, their overuse raises con-
cerns, including the emergence of drug-resistant pathogens,
disruption of metabolic processes in ﬁsh, antibiotic bioaccu-
mulation, and potential risks to human health [6, 7]. In addi-
tion, drugs and antibiotics used in aquaculture can pose
environmental hazards.
Therefore, the search for alternative bio-based treatments
has gained momentum in recent decades. Studies have shown
that medicinal plants, probiotics, and immune stimulants can
serve as promising solutions to replace antibiotics and che-
micals. The use of these compounds can ensure ﬁsh health,
immunity, and resistance to diseases without the side effects
of conventional drugs [8, 9].
Studies show that herbal medicine has numerous bene ﬁts
in aquaculture and can be a sustainable alternative to anti-
biotics and chemicals. Medicinal plants and their derivatives
can enhance ﬁsh immunity, increase disease resistance, and
reduce in ﬂammation. Some medicinal plants and their phy-
tochemical compounds have antimicrobial properties against
pathogens. Herbal medicines reduce the risk of drug resis-
tance, are environmentally friendly, and improve growth by
enhancing digestion and nutrient absorption. In addition,
they reduce chemical residues in ﬁsh products and ensure
food safety. Affordable and locally available herbal medicine
offers a practical solution to improve ﬁsh health and support
sustainable aquaculture practices [5]. In addition to their
antibacterial and anti-in ﬂammatory properties, medicinal
plants can enhance ﬁsh’s immune systems, promote growth,
and improve survival rates.
Several medicinal plants have been reported to enhance
ﬁsh immunity and disease resistance. Dietary supplementa-
tion with Oliveria decumbens signiﬁcantly improved antiox-
idant and antibacterial defenses against Streptococcus iniae in
Nile tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus [10]. Similarly, Eichhornia
crassipes leaf extract boosted immune parameters in rainbow
trout, O. mykiss [11]. Rhus vernici ﬂua exhibited antibacterial
effects against Edwardsiella tarda in olive ﬂounder, Para-
lichthys olivaceus [12]. Moreover, Mentha longifolia extract
effectively inhibited Yersinia ruckeri in rainbow trout [13].
Additionally,Lavandula angustifolias
 upplementation in com-
mon carp, Cyprinus carpio , enhanced nonspeci ﬁc immune
parameters and reduced in ﬂammation and oxidative stress
[14]. Wang et al. [15] found that a Chinese herbal medicine
mixture (CHMM) signiﬁcantly improved the immune response
!and resistance to infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus
(IHNV) infection in rainbow trout by modulating immune
gene expression and reducing oxidative stress markers [16].
Moreover, Pan et al. [17] reported that the administration of
puriﬁed Astragalus polysaccharide (P-APS) as an adjuvant
increased vaccination efﬁcacy against IHNV in rainbow trout.
Similarly, Yilmaz et al. [18] reported that Valeriana ofﬁcinalis
and Passiﬂora incarnataextracts could modulate hematological
and biochemical parameters following exposure to Lactococcus
garvieae. Pourmand et al. [19] found that dietary supplementa-
tion with garlic, black seed, and black caraway essential oils
enhanced immune parameters in rainbow trout, with garlic
essential oil showing the most pronounced effects, particularly
in boosting lysozyme activity, complement levels, and TNF- α
expression.
Medicinal plants play a crucial role in mitigating oxida-
tive stress, a major challenge in intensive aquaculture sys-
tems. Ghafarifarsani et al. [20] reported that a herbal mixture
of Malva sylvestris, Origanum vulgare, and Allium hirtifolium
improved antioxidant enzyme activity (superoxide dismutase
(SOD), CAT, GR), thereby, reducing oxidative damage in
common carp. Similar effects were observed with Juniperus
communis essential oil (JCEO) in rainbow trout [21], indicat-
ing the broad applicability of plant-based antioxidants.
Medicinal plants contribute to improved ﬁsh growth and
feed ef ﬁciency. Aghili et al. [22] found that dietary supple-
mentation with turmeric, Curcuma longa , and black pepper,
Piper nigrum , enhanced growth, hematological parameters,
and immune function in rainbow trout. K öse, Karabulut, and
Er [23] showed that Taraxacum of ﬁcinale extract improved
protein ef ﬁciency and growth in rainbow trout. Similarly,
Kaya, Karata ş, and Guroy [24] found that pot marigold,
Calendula of ﬁcinalis, enhanced growth indices and feed con-
version ef ﬁciency.
The incorporation of medici nal plants in aquaculture
offers eco-friendly and cost-effective alternatives to synthetic
drugs and antibiotics. Studies have shown that medicinal
plants used as dietary supplem ents can improve aquaculture
outcomes [2, 25–27]. Semwal, Kumar, and Kumar [28] reported
the sustainability of plant-basedtreatments, promoting organic
aquaculture while minimizing environmental impact. Their
widespread availability and low cost make them viable options
for improving ﬁs
h health and production ef ﬁciency.
Among the many medicinal plants being explored for
their potential in aquaculture, Achillea wilhelmsii (AW),
stands out due to its well-documented therapeutic properties.
Wild or overgrown yarrow (AW), a member of the chicory
family, is widely distributed in the northern regions of Iran,
including Mazandaran and Golestan provinces [29], as well as
Azerbaijan, Fars, Sistan and Baluchistan, Hamedan, and Teh-
ran provinces. This small herbaceous plant (15 –40 cm) has a
branched stem and green and hairy leaves.
Over 100 biologically active compounds have been iden-
tiﬁed in yarrow [30]. Yarrow (AW) is a traditional herbal
medicine known for its anti-in ﬂammatory, antimicrobial,
2 Aquaculture Nutrition
and antioxidant properties, primarily due to its ﬂavonoid
compounds, such as lutein, apigenin, rutin, and phenolic
compounds [31]. This plant extract has improved immune
function in various animals, including ﬁsh [32]. Akbar et al.
[33] showed that the ethanolic extract of A. santolinoides
subsp. wilhelmsii (WEEAW) had potent antioxidant, antimi-
crobial, and anti-in ﬂammatory effects, particularly against
Staphylococcus aureus . The essential oil of AW, rich in fra-
granol, fragranyl acetate, and oleic acid, demonstrated nota-
ble antimicrobial activity, particularly against Candida
albicans and S. aureus , as well as effectiveness against gram
negative bacteria like Acinetobacter baumannii and Shigella
dysenteriae [34]. Sirakov et al. [35], Bahabadi et al. [32], and
Koshinski [36] found that yarrow supplementation
improved growth and blood biochemical parameters in
rainbow trout. Alinezhad [37] showed yarrow extract
improved hematological and immune responses in common
carp, enhancing red blood cell (RBC) counts, immunoglobu-
lin (Ig) levels, and lysozyme concentration. Banaee et al. [38]
demonstrated that yarrow extract reduced mortality and
improved enzyme activities in carp infected with Aeromo-
nas hydrophila . Altinterim, Danabas, and Aksu [39] found
that yarrow hydrosol improved hematological and immune
parameters in common carp infected with Y. ruckeri,s u g g e s t -
ing its potential in aquaculture.
Therefore, the use of immune system stimulants such as
plant derivatives may improve ﬁsh’s immune system func-
tion and support their health in intensive culture systems
[40]. In this study, it was hypothesized that the use of yarrow
(AW) extract can improve the immune system function and
physiology of rainbow trout ( O. mykiss). This study aimed to
evaluate biochemical, immune, and oxidative stress indices
in ﬁsh treated with different concentrations of yarrow.
2. Material and Methods
2.1. Fish. Three hundred and seventy-one pieces of rainbow
trout, weighing an average of 14.7 Æ 1.7 g, were purchased
from the Delkhan Fish Breeding Workshop in Sepidan
County (Fars Province, Iran). Experimental protocols were
performed in accordance with the Iranian animal ethics
framework under the supervision of the Iranian Society for
the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals and Shiraz University
Research Council (IACUC no: 9132738). According to stan-
dard protocols, the ﬁsh were transferred to the laboratory in
aerated tanks. Before introducing them to the laboratory, the
halls and storage tanks disinfection was carried out using a
formalin dose of 250 ppm for 60 min, and the 500-L tanks
were dewatered to prevent contamination. The ﬁsh were
distributed into 12 groups at random, with four treatments,
and each treatment included three replicates. Each replicate
consisted of 25 ﬁsh, ensuring suf ﬁcient numbers for statisti-
cal analysis. The water in all 12 tanks was changed by 20%
daily to maintain optimal water quality. Fish were adapted
for 3 weeks to their new environment before any experimen-
tal treatments were applied. The well was used as the water
source. Throughout the test period, water parameters were
closely monitored, and the temperature was maintained at
14.7 Æ 1.9°C, the pH level was 7.4 Æ 0.33, the dissolved oxy-
gen (DO) content was 6.5 Æ 1.09 mg/L, the total suspended
solids (TSSs) was 29 Æ 0.15 mg/L, total dissolved solids
(TDSs) was 450 Æ 50 mg/L, electrical conductivity (EC) was
<200 µS/cm, ammonia (NH
3/NH4
+), nitrite (NO 2
−), and
nitrate (NO3 −) were <0.05, <0.2, and <25 mg/L, hardness
and alkalinity was 150 Æ 25 mg/L as CaCO 3. These conditions
were carefully regulated to promote the health and welfare of
the ﬁsh during the study. Measuring water quality, including
temperature, TSS, TDS, EC, pH, DO, ammonia, nitrite,
nitrate, hardness, and alkalinity, was done with appropriate
meters and test kits, such as a thermometer, pH meter, DO
meter, and colorimetric kits for ammonia and nitrites.
2.2. AW Extract Preparation, Feed Formulation, and
Administration. Wild yarrow (AW) was collected from the
natural habitat of this plant in the Fars Province (Faculty of
Agriculture). The extracti on was prepared according to
Gholamhosseini et al. [41]. Brie ﬂy, 10 kg of wild yarrow leaves
were pulverized in a dry environment, away from sunlight, in
dry air, using a mill [41]. Following the method described by
Gholamhosseini et al. [41], the obtained powder was mixed in
1-L of 80 % methanol in a ratio of 1:5 in ﬂasks. The mixture
was gently agitated on a shaker for 48 h to facilitate extraction.
The resulting mixture was then ﬁltered through a strainer and
Buchner funnel. The solvents were then evaporated from the
primary extracts using a rotary evaporator to yield the con-
centrated yarrow extract [27].
A preliminary study was co nducted to determine the
optimal concentration range for wild yarrow (AW) extract.
The selected concentrations were 0.25% , 0.5 %,1 %,2 %,3 %,
and 4 % of wild yarrow extract mixed with the basal diet.
Based on these ﬁndings, four experimental diets were formu-
lated with 0 % (control group), 0.5 %,1 %,a n d2 % of the
extract. Each supplemented d iet was entirely combined
with water to form a consistent paste, which was then pro-
cessed using a Pars Khazar meat grinder. The paste was
extruded at a mechanical pressure of 200 kPa using an
extruder cylinder, followed by drying in warm air for 24 h.
The dried product was then ground into pellets with an
approximate diameter of 0.3 cm and stored at refrigeration
temperatures. Throughout the 8-week study, the ﬁsh were
fed three times daily, with the feeding amount set at 2 % of
their body weight (Table 1).
2.3. Sampling Time and Method. After 56 days, 15 ﬁsh from
each treatment group ( ﬁve per iteration) were randomly
sampled to evaluate growth and immunochemical responses.
Feeding was stopped for 24 h before sampling to standardize
the ﬁsh’s physiological state and minimize any potential con-
founding effects from recent feeding. After sampling, the
challenge was evaluated.
2.4. Growth Performance. The growth performance of the
ﬁsh was measured using the following formula [41]. More-
over, to assess growth performance, ﬁsh were starved for 24 h
before sampling and weighing to ensure accurate measure-
ments. The growth performance parameters were calculated
based on initial and ﬁnal measurements. Speci ﬁc growth rate
Aquaculture Nutrition 3
(SGR) was determined to measure growth rate as a percentage
per day, using the formula:
SGR ¼ lnWf − lnWi
T × 100;
where Wf is the ﬁnal weight, Wi the initial weight, and T the
duration of the study in days.
Weight gain (WG) was calculated as the difference
between ﬁnal and initial weights:
WG ¼ Wf − Wi:
Feed conversion ratio (FCR) was assessed to determine
feed utilization ef ﬁciency, calculated as:
FCR ¼ Feed consumed gðÞ
Weight gain gðÞ :
Finally, condition factor (CF) was evaluated to relate ﬁsh
weight to length, providing an indicator of body condition,
using the formula:
CF ¼
W
L3 × 100;
where W represents weight in grams and L is the length in
centimeters.
2.5. Blood Collection. Blood sampling was conducted follow-
ing capture and anesthesia using clove powder at a concentra-
tion of 150 ppm. Blood samples were collected from the caudal
vein with a 3-cc syringe, utilizing sterile, nonheparinized tubes
for biochemical and immunological analyses. In contrast, hep-
arinized tubes were used to assess hematology indicators. The
nonheparinized samples were centrifuged at 6000 rpm for
10 min at 4 °C to separate the serum. The serum samples were
promptly stored in a freezer at −80°C, as recommended by
Banaee, Sureda, and Faggio [42].
2.6. White Blood Cell (WBC) and RBC Count. Nat and Her-
rick staining methods were used to count WBC and RBC.
One milliliter of blood was mixed with a staining solution to
achieve a ﬁnal volume of 50 mL. This mixture was incubated
for 30 min at room temperature to allow for effective stain-
ing. After incubation, the cell count was performed using a
calibrated hemocytometer slide. The numbers of WBCs and
RBCs were calculated and expressed as cells per microliter
(cells/µL) [43].
2.7. Serum Biochemical Markers. The assessment of biochem-
ical parameters, including glucose, total protein, triglycerides,
cholesterol, liver enzymatic activities (lactate dehydrogenase
(LDH), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and aspartate ami-
notransferase (AST)), and creatinine, was conducted using
Pars Azmoon commercial kits [27, 44]. Each biochemical
parameter was assessed according to the speci ﬁc instructions
provided with the Pars Azmoon kits, using appropriate
volumes of serum and reagents. All biochemical parameters
were measured by an autoanalyzer (Sanjesh Co. Iran).
2.8. Oxidative Biomarkers. The assessment of SOD activity
was conducted using the SD125 Ransod kit (RANDOX, UK).
The reaction mixture was prepared according to the
manufacturer ’s instructions, combining the serum with
Xanthine Oxidase and 2-(4-iodophenyl)-3-(4-nitrophenol)-
5-phenyl tetrazolium chloride( I . N . T ) .T h i sm i x t u r ew a s
incubated at 37 °C for a speci ﬁed duration. After incubation,
the absorbance of the reaction mixture was measured at
approximately 490 nm using a spectrophotometer. The SOD
activity was calculated based on the level of inhibition of the
reaction, comparing the absorbance of the sample to that of
the control, which contained no sample [45].
2.9. Immunological Parameters. Serum lysozyme activity was
quantiﬁed using the method described by Parry, Chandan,
and shahani [46]. A suspension of Micrococcus lysodeikticus
cells in 0.05 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.2) at a con-
centration of 0.2 mg/mL was prepared as the substrate for
lysozyme. For the assay, 25 μL of serum was added to a
cuvette containing 2.5 mL of the M. lysodeikticus cell sus-
pension and the absorbance was immediately measured at
450 nm using a spectrophotometer. The decrease in absor-
bance at 450 nm, recorded over 1 –3 min at 15-s intervals,
indicated lysozyme activity as the enzyme degrades bacterial
cell walls, reducing turbidity. Lysozyme activity was calcu-
lated as the rate of decrease in absorbance per minute, with
activity typically expressed in units per milliliter (U/mL),
where one unit represents a decrease in absorbance of 0.001
per min. A blank sample, using sodium phosphate buffer
instead of serum, was included to control for nonenzymatic
changes in absorbance [41].

Serum IgM levels were measured using the immunotur-
bidimetry method with a commercial kit (Pars test). This kit
typically includes a sample diluent for serum preparation, a
primary reagent (Solution No. 1) containing speci ﬁc antibo-
dies that bind to IgM and form immune complexes, and a
secondary reagent (Solution No. 2) that enhances sensitivity
by binding to these complexes. In a 96-well microplate, Solu-
tion No. 1 was added to all wells, mixed, and incubated at
37°C for 3 –5 min. The initial absorbance of the serum sam-
ples and standards was measured at 340 nm. Solution No. 2
was then added, mixed, and incubated at 37° C for an addi-
tional 10 min before measuring the absorbance again. The
change in absorbance was calculated by subtracting the ini-
tial from the secondary absorbance, and the IgM concentra-
tion in the serum samples was determined using a standard
curve generated from the provided standards.
2.10. Bacterial Challenge. The method described by Gholam-
hosseini et al. [41] was followed to investigate the survival
rate of rainbow trout (O. mykiss) after a challenge with Y. ruck-
eri (KC291153). Initially, a bacterial culture of Y. ruckeri was
grown in tryptic soy broth (TSB) at 22 °C for 24 h and then,
adjusted to the desired concentration (e.g., 1 × 10
7 CFU/mL)
using sterile phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), with the con-
centration con ﬁrmed by plating on tryptic soy agar (TSA).
Next, ﬁsh in each experimental group were exposed to the
bacterial suspension through either intraperitoneal injection
(0.1 mL of 1 × 10
7 CFU/mL) or immersion, while control ﬁsh
received sterile PBS. After the challenge, the ﬁsh were moni-
tored daily for clinical signs of infection, behavioral changes,
and mortality, with water quality parameters consistently
maintained. Mortality data were recorded for each group
over a speci ﬁed period (e.g., 14 days postchallenge), allowing
for the calculation of survival rates as a percentage of surviv-
ing ﬁsh out of the initial total. Cumulative mortality rates were
also determined to compare responses between groups. Dead
ﬁsh were removed immediately to prevent further disease
spread and the remaining population was closely monitored
for signs of infection. Dead ﬁsh were immersed in lime water
to exterminate.
2.11. Statistical Analysis. Data analysis was performed using
SPSS software version 18. Initially, the Shapiro –Wilk test was
applied to evaluate the normality of the data distribution.
Following this, a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
was conducted to determine the overall differences between
treatment groups. Next, Duncan ’s multiple range test was
employed for post hoc comparisons to identify speci ﬁcg r o u p
differences ( p<0:05). To minimize experimental error, all
measurements were conducted in triplicate.
3. Results
3.1. Fish Growth. In this study, the inclusion of AW in the
diet did not result in signi ﬁcant alterations in WG, SGR, or
FCR when compared to the control group (Table 2).
3.2. Haematological Parameters. The hematological ﬁndings
for ﬁsh that received different concentrations of AW are pre-
sented in Table 3. All treatment groups demonstrated signi ﬁ-
cant increases in RBC, hematocrit (Htc), and hemoglobin
(Hb) relative to the control group. Signi ﬁcant differences in
WBC counts were observed only in the 1 % and 2 % AW
groups compared to the control. Feeding ﬁsh with AW extract
showed signiﬁcant increases in Hb and Htc levels ( p <0:05).
The 1 % AW diet group showed a signi ﬁcant decrease in cir-
culating lymphocytes, while neutrophil counts signi ﬁcantly
increased. No signiﬁcant differences in monocyte percentages
were detected between the groups ( p >0:05; Table 3).
3.3. The Blood Biochemical Parameters. The blood biochem-
ical markers for groups supplemented with AW over 8 weeks
are summarized in Table 4. Glucose levels remained compa-
rable between the supplemented groups and the control
group ( p >0:05). Creatinine concentrations were lower in
the supplemented groups than in the control, with a statisti-
cally signi ﬁcant reduction observed speci ﬁcally in the 1 %
AW group ( p <0:05). No signi ﬁcant differences were found
in the levels of AST, ALT, or LDH among the rainbow trout,
O. mykiss, after 8 weeks of AW supplementation, with the 1 %
AW group showing the lowest values. Furthermore, lipid-
related parameters, including cholesterol and triglycerides,
were reduced following AW administration, especially in
the 0.5 % and 1 % AW groups (Table 4). Serum protein levels
increased in the groups receiving AW extract, with the most
pronounced elevation observed in the 1 % and 2 % AW
groups.
3.4. Immunological Parameters. The 1% AW treatment group
exhibited a signiﬁcant enhancement in lysozyme activity com-
pared to the control group, with a p-value of less than 0.05.
Additionally, AW-supplemented diets led to a notable rise in
se
rum immunoglobulin M (IgM) levels, particularly in the 3 %
AW treatment group (Table 5).

3.5. Oxidative Biomarkers. In this study, the levels of SOD
were found to increase in the groups given different doses of
AW extract, with the 2 % AW group exhibiting signi ﬁcantly
higher enzyme levels than the others (Figure 1). Further-
more, using 1 % and 2 % AW extracts increased humoral
immune parameters, including IgM, with the highest levels
of IgM observed in the 2 % group after 8 weeks.
3.6. Serum Bactericidal Activity. The bactericidal activity of
the serum was tested against S. iniae , Y. ruckeri , L. garviea ,
and A. hydrophila bacteria after the eighth week, and the ﬁsh
fed with 2 % AW extract showed the best performance against
A. hydrophila, and the 1 % and 2 % groups against Y. ruckeri
(Table 6).
3.7. Bacterial Challenge. After the analysis, all treatment
groups were challenged with Y. ruckeri, a pathogen that poses
as i g n iﬁcant threat to aquaculture operations (Figure 2).
Notably, the cumulative mortality rate for all of the AW treat-
ment groups was substantially lower than that of the control
group, and the 1 % AW-supplemented group experienced the
lowest mortality rate.
4. Discussions
4.1. Growth Performance. Studies have shown that medicinal
plant extracts can improve ﬁsh growth and feed ef ﬁciency. In
this research, dietary supplementation with AW did not sig-
niﬁcantly alter WG, SGR, or FCR when contrasted with the
control group (Table 2). Improvement of growth perfor-
mance and reduction of food conversion ratio in ﬁsh can
be due to the favorable effects of medicinal plants on diges-
tion, stimulation of bile secretion, and improvement of pan-
creatic enzyme function [47]; however, these results were not
observed in previous studies. Ghafarifarsani et al. [20] found
increased digestive enzyme activity in carp, indicating
improved nutrient absorption. K öse, Karabulut, and Er
[23] found that dandelion root extract improved growth
and protein ef ﬁciency in rainbow trout. Kaya, Karata ş, and
Guroy [24] reported that pot marigold extract enhanced
growth indices and feed conversion in rainbow trout. Wild
yarrow plants (AW) contain several compounds, including
ﬂavonoids, saponin, and terpenes, which are related to the
antibacterial properties of this plant. In addition, this plant
can make food more palatable because of its attractive
compounds, which provide a sense of smell. Studies have
shown that using plant derivatives with antibiotic properties
could improve carcass quality and growth by changing and
enhancing the ﬂora of the gastrointestinal system. Moreover,
some compounds in medicinal plants, including ﬂavonoids,
increase ﬁsh’s growth performance and health [8]. Increases
in the FW, WG, and SGR of yellow cat ﬁsh, Pelteobagrus
fulvidraco, after feeding with Glycyrrhiza uralensis extract
have been reported [48]. In addition, signi ﬁcant increases
in WG, SGR, and FW have been observed in O. niloticus
fed gotu kola, Centella asiatica powder [49]. In another study,
improvements in SGR and FCR in common carp, C. carpio ,
were observed owing to the use of different doses of polyphe-
nols extracted from chestnut and olive mill wastewater [50];
however, these results are in contrast to those of previous
studies. The 8-week feeding trial demonstrated that garlic
powder supplementation signi ﬁcantly enhances growth per-
formance in juvenile rainbow trout, O. mykiss , with higher
SGR and improved FCR compared to probiotics and mixed
treatments [51]. Ghafarifarsani et al. [20] found that a herbal
mixture of M. sylvestris, O. vulgare, and A. hirtifolium signiﬁ-
cantly enhanced growth and reduced FCR in common carp.
Hajirezaee et al. [21] observed similar growth improvements
in rainbow trout with common juniper, J. communis, essential
oil supplementation.
4.2. Hematology. Hematological markers are crucial indica-
tors for evaluating ﬁshes ’ physiological well-being and
health, as they provide valuable insights into various physio-
logical processes [52, 53]. Nutritional factors and dietary
supplements can affect blood cells, and the impact of these
factors depends on the different types of leukocytes [44].
Feeding ﬁsh with diets containing AW extract resulted in
increased levels of RBCs, Hb content, and Htc. At the same
time
, the total count of WBC displayed signi ﬁcant changes
only in the 1 % and 2 % AW groups compared to the control
group (Table 3). Although there was no signi ﬁcant difference
in the number of blood monocytes, a remarkable increase in
the number of neutrophils was observed in the 1 % AW

treatment group compared to the control group. The increase
in RBC, Hb, and Htc levels suggests that AW extract may
enhance oxygen transport and improve ﬁsh health, poten-
tially due to its antioxidant or immunomodulatory properties.
Signiﬁcant changes in WBC counts were dose-dependent,
indicating an effect on immune activation. A considerable
increase in neutrophils suggested that the 1 % extract may
enhance the ﬁsh’s innate immune response, improving infec-
tion resistance and stress. Similarly, administering tarragon
and mint extracts orally enhanced the RBC count, WBC
count, Hb content, and Htc levels in rainbow trout, O. mykiss,
and Caspian white ﬁsh, Rutilus kutum [41, 44]. G üroy et al.
[51] found that garlic supplementation signiﬁ cantly affected
hematological parameters [51]. Aghili et al. [22] reported
that the inclusion of turmeric, C. longa , and black pepper,
P. nigrum , in the diet enhances growth performance and
improves hematological parameters in rainbow trout. Simi-
larly, Yilmaz et al. [18] found that administering extracts from
V. ofﬁcinalis and P. incarnata adjusts hematological and bio-
chemical parameters in rainbow trout following exposure to
L. garvieae .
4.3. Biochemical Indicators. Blood biochemical parameters
can be relied upon to assess the health status of ﬁsh accu-
rately. These parameters change in response to changes in
nutritional status, making them valuable for determining the
well-being of ﬁsh [54, 55]. In this study, the serum glucose
levels of ﬁsh treated with the AW extract were not signi ﬁcantly
different from those of the control group. Previous studies
have shown that ﬂavonoids in plants can reduce intestinal
glucose absorption by inhibiting the sodium-dependent glu-
cose transport mechanism [56]. However, this has not been
observed in this study. Creatinine is a byproduct of normal
muscle metabolism that is typically produced consistently, ﬁl-
tered by the kidneys, and excreted in the urine. Its level re ﬂects
renal ﬁltration, and creatinine indicates kidney health [57].
Any kidney damage can increase creatinine levels [58]. The
results of this study revealed that the creatinine levels in the
control group were higher than those in the treatment group.
Therefore, the reduction in blood creatinine in ﬁsh treated
with the AW extract indicates an improvement in the ef ﬁ-
ciency of the renal system in creatinine excretion. The activities
of AST, ALT, and LDH did not signi ﬁcantly change in the
serum of rainbow trout after 8 weeks of feeding with different
doses of AW extract compared to the control group and the
lowest values were observed in the 1 % group. SGOT or AST is
a ubiquitous enzyme present throughout the body, particularly
in the heart and liver, and to a lesser extent in the kidneys and
muscles. As an essential enzyme in the liver, AST plays a
crucial role in neutralizing toxic agents and participating in
metabolic activities. On the other hand, ALT, a glycoprotein
enzyme attached to the cell membrane, is involved in various
cellular processes, including growth and migration, protein
phosphorylation, and apoptosis [54, 55]. Additionally, LDH
is an enzyme involved in cellular respiration and is released
into the stream during liver disease, anemia, and muscle dam-
age [59]. Interestingly, Adangale, Ghosh, and Wairkar [60]
found that the thyme-fed group had signi ﬁcantly lower LDH
levels, indicating stable liver and biliary function in response to
Cd during the experiment. The total protein concentration in
plasma compared to the standard range serves as a clinical
index to assess aquatic organisms ’ health, stress, and physio-
logical condition [45]. Plasma proteins, primarily produced in
the liver cells, are essential extracellular proteins that reﬂect the
liver’s
nutritional status and proper functioning [57]. Accord-
ing to Ahmadi et al. [61], there is a direct correlation between
the total plasma protein concentration and the levels of hepatic
protein synthesis. Consequently, the increase in total plasma
protein observed in rainbow trout fed 1 % and 2% AW extract
can be attributed to improved liver protein synthesis. The same
study also revealed that adding plants like mistletoe, Viscum
album,s t i n g i n gn e t t l e ,Urtica dioica,g i n g e r ,Zingiber ofﬁcinale,
silymarin, Silybum marianum, and yarrow extract, A. millefo-
lium [27, 32, 55], to ﬁsh diets increased total plasma protein
levels. A signiﬁcant change in total protein was observed in the

In contrast, triglyceride and cholesterol levels decreased
in ﬁsh fed diets containing AW extract compared to the
control group, especially in the 0.5 % and 1 % treatments.
Triglyceride levels indicate nutritional status and serum total
protein and cholesterol levels [62]. Flavonoids in plants have
been shown to decrease blood cholesterol levels by affecting
the metabolic reactions of different tissues in fat metabolism
[63]. As a result, the hepatoprotective, hypoglycemic, anti-
platelet, and antioxidant p roperties of yarrow make it a
promising candidate for use as a hypolipoproteinemic and
antiatherosclerotic agent [64]. Hajirezaee et al. [21] showed
that feeding rainbow trout with common juniper, JCEO,
increased total protein levels while reducing ALP and ALT
activities.
4.4. Immunological Parameters. Medicinal plants are effec-
tive immunostimulants. Lysozyme plays a critical role in ﬁsh
immune systems, acting as a defense mechanism against
invading microorganisms and bolstering resistance [6, 65].
In this study, serum lysozyme activity signi ﬁcantly increased
in ﬁsh fed diets containing 0.5 % and 1 % AW extract com-
pared to the control group. Serum lysozyme activity increased
signiﬁcantly in the 0.5 % and 1 % AW extract groups, indicat-
ing improved innate immunity. Lysozyme breaks glycosidic
bonds in bacterial walls, disrupting their normal function
[66]. Hajirezaee et al. [21] found that the administration of
common juniper, JCEO, could increase lysozyme activity,
alternative complement activity (ACH50), and total Ig levels
in rainbow trout, as well as improve survival rates after a
challenge with Y. ruckeri . Wang et al. [15] showed that the
CHMM could enhance the immune response and resistance
to IHNV infection in rainbow trout. Pan et al. [17] reported
that P-APS as an adjuvant increases vaccination ef ﬁcacy
against IHNV in rainbow trout. Moreover, Pourmand et al.
[19] showed that dietary supplementation with garlic, black
seed, and black caraway essential oils improves immune
parameters in rainbow trout, with garlic exhibiting the most
potent effects on lysozyme activity, complement levels, and
TNF-α expression.
The results showed that AW extract enhances the ﬁsh’s
immune system. Higher doses enhanced IgM values, partic-
ularly in the 2 % AW group, suggesting a boost in humoral
immune response and pathogen resistance. Research by Adel
et al. [44] has also shown that dietary administration of
medicinal plants can enhance the overall health of rainbow
trout by boosting innate immune responses. Ghafarifarsani
et al. [20] reported increased levels of immune markers like
Ig and lysozyme in common carp.
4.5. Oxidative Biomarkers. Oxidative stress can impair ﬁsh
health, especially in intensive systems. The signi ﬁcant increase
in SOD activity in ﬁsh fed with AW extract showed improved
antioxidant defense. SOD is a critical antioxidant enzyme
that safeguards cells from reactive oxygen species (ROS)
and free radical chain reactions [67]. It catalyzes the conver-
sion of superoxide radicals into less harmful hydrogen perox-
ide [68], thereby, bolstering the cellular defense mechanisms
against ROS [69]. The highest SOD levels in the 2 % AW
group indicated a dose-dependent effect, likely due to the
extract’s bioactive compounds, such as ﬂavonoids and phe-
nolics. These ﬁndings showed that AW may improve ﬁsh
resilience to oxidative stress, potentially enhancing overall
health and stress tolerance. Additionally, antioxidants such
as vitamin E, coenzyme Q, vitamin C, glutathione, and sele-
nium function synergistically to mitigate lipid peroxidation
and cellular damage [70]. Plant polyphenolic compounds act
as electron donors, exerting antioxidant effects through enzy-
matic and nonenzymatic pathways. Yarrow extract demon-
strated antioxidant properties by reducing the accumulation
of malondialdehyde and salicylic acid, indicating its ability to
prevent lipid peroxidation [25]. Hajirezaee et al. [21] demon-
strated that the inclusion of common juniper, JCEO, in the diet
of rainbow trout resulted in elevated CAT and SOD activities.
Wang et al. [15] found that the CHMM could improve the
functions of antioxidant and immune-related enzymes while
reducing oxidative stress markers and modulating immune
gene expression. Ghafarifarsani et al. [20] found that medicinal
plants increased antioxidant enzyme activities (SOD, CAT,
an
d GR) in ﬁsh, reducing oxidative damage and improving
overall health. Flavonoids, natural antioxidants found in plants,
enhance blood circulation, reduce in ﬂammation, and inhibit
cancer cell growth [71].
4.6. Survival After the Challenge. Medicinal plants improve
immunity and disease resistance. Moreover, medicinal plants
offer potential antimicrobial bene ﬁts. Plant extracts rich in
bioactive compounds, such as ﬂavonoids and alkaloids, offer
an eco-friendly alternative to antibiotics. After the challenge
with Y. ruckeri, the 1 % group exhibited the lowest cumulative
frequency of casualties, which was considered a signi ﬁcant
achievement. Waine et al. [72] established that the onset of
susceptibility to Y. ruckeri infection in rainbow trout occurs
at 14 days posthatch (dph). They showed signi ﬁcant varia-
tions in mortality rates exist across different developmental
stages, indicating a critical period for managing ERM in
juvenile salmonids. In exploring the mechanisms of Y. ruckeri
infection in ﬁsh, Yang et al. [73] provided insights into the
inﬂammatory responses and alterations in intestinal micro-
biota composition resulting from the infection. Additionally,
Soto-Dávila et al. [74] reported a signi ﬁcant upregulation of
pro-inﬂammatory cytokines during natural infections with
Y. ruckeri . A study by Harikrishnan et al. [75] showed that
the injection of extracts from three plants— neem, Azadirachta
indica, basil, Ocimum sanctum, and turmeric, C. longa led to a
signiﬁcant increase in ﬁsh resistance and immune response in
goldﬁsh, Carassius auratus. Terzi et al. [76] showed that Pru-
nus domestica extract enhanced immune responses and sur-
vival in rainbow trout infected with Y. ruckeri . Similarly,
Hajirezaee et al. [21] reported increased survival rates in
juniper-supplemented trout challenged with the same patho-
gen, suggesting a natural alternative to antibiotics for disease
prevention. Moreover, Yang et al. [77] highlighted the
potential of dietary interventions in enhancing ﬁsh health,
demonstrating that dietary supplementation with Agaricus
bisporus polysaccharides (ABPs) signi ﬁcantly improved
10 Aquaculture Nutrition
growth, immune response, and antioxidant activity in chan-
nel cat ﬁsh, Ictalurus punctatus , challenged with Y. ruckeri .
Adeli, Shamloofar, and Akrami [78] showed that lemon
verbena, Aloysia triphylla , extract boosted immune param-
eters and reduced stress in trout. K öse, Karabulut, and Er
[23] found dandelion root extract improved survival rates
against L. garvieae infection.
5. Conclusion
The ﬁndings of this study indicated that diets supplemented
with AW may have bene ﬁcial effects on the blood and bio-
chemical parameters, as well as enhancing the immune
response of rainbow trout. Although no signi ﬁcant improve-
ments in growth performance, such as WG, SGR, or FCR,
were observed, the inclusion of AW resulted in bene ﬁcial
effects on blood pro ﬁles, with increased RBC counts and
improved kidney function indicated by lower creatinine
levels. Moreover, the study revealed enhancements in serum
lysozyme activity and SOD levels, emphasizing the immune-
boosting properties of AW. Thus, based on these results,
feeding rainbow trout a diet supplemented with 2 % AW is
recommended. Future studies are encouraged to explore the
effects of AW under intensive culture conditions to validate
these ﬁndings and to understand its potential applications in
aquaculture.
