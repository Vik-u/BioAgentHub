ABSTRACT: Protein engineering of cutinases is a promising strategy for the
biocatalytic degradation of non-natural polyesters. We report a mechanistic study
addressing the hydrolysis of the aliphatic polyester poly(butylene succinate, or
PBS) by the fungal Apergillus oryzae cutinase enzyme. Through atomistic
molecular dynamics simulations and advanced alchemical transformations, we
reveal how three units of a model PBS substrate fit the active site cleft of the
enzyme, interacting with hydrophobic side chains. The substrate ester moiety
approaches the Asp−His−Ser catalytic triad, displaying catalytically competent
conformations. Acylation and deacylation hydrolytic reactions were modeled
according to a canonical esterase mechanism using umbrella sampling simulations
at the quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical DFT(B3LYP)/6−31G**/AMBERff level. The free energy profiles of both steps
show a high-energy tetrahedral intermediate resulting from the nucleophilic attack on the ester’s carboxylic carbon. The free energy
barrier of the acylation step is higher (20.2 ± 0.6 kcal mol
−1
) than that of the deacylation step (13.6 ± 0.6 kcal mol
−1
). This is likely
due to the interaction of the ester’s carboxylic oxygen with the oxyanion hole in the reactive conformation of the deacylation step. In
contrast, these interactions form as the reaction proceeds during the acylation step. The formation of an additional hydrogen bond
interaction with the side chain of Ser48 is crucial to stabilizing the developing charge at the carboxylic oxygen, thus lowering the
activation free energy barrier. These mechanistic insights will inform the design of enzyme variants with improved activity for plastic
degradation.

INTRODUCTION
The management of disposable plastic waste has become a
global environmental challenge.
1
Most waste ends up buried in
landfills or released into the ecosystem.
2
Only a minor part of
such waste is recycled. Further aggravating it, recent studies
report that even the correct implementation of the current
policies for plastic waste management will not be effective in
reverting the accumulation of waste in the environment.
3
This
worrying scenario calls for the immediate development of new,
environmentally friendly technologies for a circular plastic
economy.
4
In this respect, advances have been pursued from
different perspectives. On one side, materials research is
pursuing the development of innovative polymeric materials
that are easier to degrade than commercial plastics. From
another perspective, the research attempts to develop cost-
effective degrading technologies capable of breaking current
polymers into their constituent building blocks, thus enabling a
circular plastic economy.
In this context, biotechnological approaches constitute an
attractive strategy for plastic degradation compared to
chemical and physical treatment.
5
This approach, put forward
more than 50 years ago,
6,7
has gained considerable attention
since discovering the bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis.
8
This
bacterium can live on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET),
used as a carbon source. The activity of I. sakaiensis is due to
the action of two enzymes, named PETase and MEHase, both
belonging to the esterase family of enzymes.
9
Indeed, the ester
bonds that join the building blocks of such polyesters are
amenable to hydrolysis by carboxylic ester hydrolases.
10
Unfortunately, the activity of wild-type PETase and MEHase
enzymes toward polyesters is too low for their practical
applications. This prompted numerous studies to improve
polymer degradation by the protein engineering of more
efficacious hydrolytic enzymes.
11
In particular, efforts focus on
the hydrolysis of PET by modified bacterial cutinases, a

subfamily of α/β hydrolases responsible for the hydrolysis of
cutin, the structural component of higher plant cuticle.
12
Interestingly, protein engineering efforts were often based on a
rational approach, leveraging the available structural data and
aided by molecular modeling and machine learning.
13−19
Moreover, detailed atomistic studies of the reaction mecha-
nism of PET hydrolysis by PETase have been conducted.
20−24
Oddly, less attention has been paid to fungal cutinases and
polyesters other than PET. Fungal cutinases share the α/β
hydrolases fold with their bacterial counterparts, being smaller
and displaying low sequence identity with bacterial cutinases.
25
Previous studies experimentally investigated the biodegrada-
tion activity of the cutinase from Aspergillus oryzea (AoCut,
Figure 1a,b), a filamentous fungus used in the food industry for
fermentation processes.
26
AoCut is ∼200 residues long and
features the classical elements of the α/β hydrolases fold,
27
including a central β-sheet comprising five parallel strands
surrounded by ten α-helices. Here, catalysis is carried out by a
triad of residues, namely, Ser126, Asp181, and His194, with
the nucleophilic hydroxyl of Ser126 activated by the flanking
His194, in turn assisted by Asp181 (Figure 1d). The oxyanion
hole, formed by the backbone amide −NH− groups of Ser48
and Gln127, completes the canonical serine esterase active
site.
28
Furthermore, three disulfide bonds (Cys63-Cys76,
Cys37-Cys115, and Cys177-Cys184) are present along the
chain, contributing to fold stabilization.
AoCut has been reported to hydrolyze poly(butylene
succinate) (PBS) and poly(butylene succinate-co-adipate)
(PBSA) in emulsion preparations and films.
29
Partial
hydrolysis was observed for poly(lactic acid) (PLA). Indeed,
the biodegradability of aliphatic polyesters, such as PBS, PBSA,
and PLA, is higher than that of aromatic polyesters, such as
PET. Nevertheless, cost-effective biodegradable recycling
systems still need to be developed. Given that the substrate
specificity of carboxylic ester hydrolases depends on substrate
recognition at the active site cleft, it is thus of great interest to
gather mechanistic insight into the biodegradation process of
aliphatic polyesters by fungal cutinases, which are characterized
by a different cleft architecture compared to bacterial cutinases
(Figure 1b).
Here, we report in atomic detail the hydrolytic mechanism
of PBS by enzyme AoCut. Specifically, classical molecular
dynamics simulations were used to investigate the recognition
of a PBS-like oligomer at the enzymatic active site cleft,
followed by hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical
(QM/MM) simulations at the B3LYP/6−31G(d,p)//AMBER
level of theory. Importantly, our QM/MM includes full long-
range electrostatics in the simulations (through a QM/MM
PME approach).
30,31
In particular, the inclusion of this term
correctly handles the long-range electrostatics of charge-
separated species resulting from the heterolytic cleavage of
bonds, as in the present case. Finally, we could reconstruct the
free energy profile for the canonical esterase mechanism of

both acylation and deacylation steps, which lead to ester
hydrolysis. Together, these findings provide guiding principles
for designing enzyme variants with improved activity for
polyester degradation.

METHODS
Model Systems. The experimental structure of the apo
AoCut (PDB code 3GBS,
26
1.75 Å resolution) was used to
build models of the apo enzyme and complexes with substrates
1 and 2 (Figure 2a). The experimental structure included
residues 26 to 212. The N- and C-termini were capped with
acetyl and N-methyl groups, respectively. Protonation states
were assigned with PROPKA3, assuming pH 7.
32
His194 was
considered neutral and protonated at the δ nitrogen. The pose
of compound 2 in the active site cleft of AoCut was generated
via docking (described below), while compound 1 was grown
from compound 2 via an alchemical approach (described
below). Systems were solvated in simulation boxes extending at
least 14 Å from the protein surface. Sodium and chloride ions
were added randomly to neutralize the system and reach a final
concentration of ∼150 mM. Final models included ∼45,000
atoms in a 80 × 80 × 70 Å
3
box.
Classical Molecular Dynamics. Molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations were performed with the pmemd module
of Amber22.
33,34
The AMBER-ff14SB force field was used for
the protein,
35
the TIP3P model for water,
36
and Joung−
Chetham parameters for monovalent ions.
37
GAFF2 bonded
and van der Waals parameters were used for compounds 1 and
2.
38
RESP partial charges were developed for compounds 1
and 2 and for the acylated form of Ser126 as described in the
Supporting Information.
39
Simulations were performed using a
cutoff of 10 Å. Long-range electrostatics were treated with the
particle mesh Ewald method.
40
Bonds involving hydrogen
atoms were constrained, allowing a time step of 2 fs.
41
After
solvent equilibration, systems were energy minimized and
gently heated while restraining protein backbone atoms to
maintain the experimental structure. The Andersen-like
temperature-coupling scheme and a Monte Carlo barostat
were used to maintain the temperature and pressure close to
room-temperature conditions (300 K and 1 bar). About 1 μs
MD simulations in the NPT ensemble were performed for the
apo AoCut, the AoCut:2 complex, and the acyl-enzyme
intermediate (with and without the R
1
O
But
H product), while
2.5 μs was accumulated for the AoCut:1 complex.
Alchemical Molecular Dynamics. The alchemical
enhanced sampling (ACES) method was used to “grow”
compound 1 from compound 2.
42
Note that the objective of
the alchemical transformation was to couple compound 1 to
the active cleft of AoCut and not to estimate their affinity. In
ACES, intramolecular torsional and electrostatic interactions of
the alchemical fragments are scaled with the alchemical
parameter λ, thus creating an enhanced sampling decoupled
state, which is propagated through the λ range via exchange
with neighboring replicas according to the replica-exchange
algorithm.
43
By this means, the conformational sampling of
compound 1 is increased, facilitating its coupling with the fully
flexible protein active site cleft. Specifically, 31 λ windows were
employed, each sampled for 5 ns by using a time step of 1 fs,
with the λ values manually adjusted to guarantee a 20−30%
replica-exchange acceptance rate between neighboring win-
dows. A swap of configurations was attempted every 2 ps.
Initial configurations were generated from 1 ns-long alchemical
simulations at each λ value, sequentially increasing λ from 0
(corresponding to compound 2) to 1 (compound 1). Atoms
unique to each compound were treated with smoothstep
softcore potentials.
44
Ten ACES transformations were
performed, starting from different initial configurations. Due
to the low residence time of compound 2 in the active cleft of
AoCut, we applied a soft harmonic restraint on the H-bonding
distances between the carbonyl oxygen of compound 1 and the
protein backbone hydrogens of the oxyanion hole. After each
transformation, 250 ns unbiased MD simulations were
performed for a cumulative simulation time of 2.5 μs.
QM/MM Molecular Dynamics. Hybrid quantum mechan-
ical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) simulations were
performed with the QUICK code interfaced with the MD
engine SANDER available from AmberTools23.
30,45
Simu-
lations were performed for the complex AoCut:1. The QM
region included the side chains of the catalytic triad Ser126,
His194, and Asp181, the peptide units of the oxyanion hole
Ser126-Gln127 and Ala47-Ser48, the side chain of Ser48, and
part of compound 1 (the central hydrolyzable unit),
accounting for about 80 atoms and a total charge of −1.
QM atoms were described by the hybrid B3LYP DFT
functional and basis set 6−31G(d,p).
46−49
The remaining
atoms were treated at the MM level, as described above. The
QM/MM simulations were performed at constant volume and
temperature (300 K) using a time step of 0.5 fs to integrate the
equations of motion. The electrostatic cutoff was set to 10 Å.
The SCF convergence criterion required a maximum RMS of 5
× 10
−7
on the change of the density matrix. QM/MM
simulations were started from equilibrated configurations from
classical MD simulations.
Umbrella Sampling. Umbrella sampling (US) QM/MM
simulations were performed to reconstruct the potential of
mean force of the acylation and deacylation steps (Figure 1d)
of the hydrolysis of substrate 1.
50,51
The progress of the
reaction was controlled by collective variables (CV) defined by
the difference of the distances of the breaking and forming
bonds (CV1 = d

5). The CVs range from about −2 (reactants state) to beyond
the transition state region (∼0.6) was sampled using about 20
windows, with the value of the CVs restrained at a specific
value by a harmonic potential (see Tables S1−S3 for further
details on the restraints reference positions and force
constants). Initial structures were taken from preliminary
steered MD simulations, which employed the same CVs to
move the system from reactant to product states. 8 ps
simulations were simulated for each window, of which the last
6 ps was used for data analysis. The potential of mean force
was reconstructed using umbrella integration.

Docking. Molecular docking was performed using the
Glide program from the Schrodinger suite.
53
Compound 2 was
docked to the active site cleft using a 20 Å side cubic search
box centered on the side chain of Ser126. An ensemble
docking approach was adopted using 1000 structures randomly
extracted from a 1 μs long equilibrium MD simulation of the
apo AoCut. Docking was performed using the Extra Precision
(XP) scoring function.

RESULTS
Formation of the Cutinase/PBS Michaelis Complex.
The first step of the enzymatic reaction is the recognition of
the substrate at the active site cleft of the fungal A. oryzae
cutinase enzyme (AoCut). Here, we used compound 1 as a
model substrate (Figure 2a). We modeled compound 1 in situ,
based on the binding of the smaller dimethyl succinate
(compound 2 in Figure 2a), which comprises the hydrolyzable
unit of PBS. Specifically, we used the alchemical enhanced
sampling (ACES) method to “grow” compound 1 from
compound 2, followed by standard MD for a cumulative
simulation time of 2.5 μs, which were analyzed to reveal the
binding modes of compound 1 in the active cleft of AoCut (see
the Supporting Information for more details).
First, we noted that conformations displaying a distance of
<4 Å between the hydrolyzable carbonyl carbon (C
Suc
in
Scheme 1) of compound 1 and the nucleophilic hydroxyl
group of Ser126 (O
Ser
in Scheme 1) accounted for 64% of the
cumulative trajectory. Clustering of these frames based on the
RMSD of the butanediol−succinate−butanediol moiety of
compound 1 showed that the substrate had a recurrent (16%)
binding mode in the active site cleft of AoCut. In these poses,
O
Suc
was not inserted in the oxyanion hole. The butanediol−

succinate−butanediol moiety was accommodated into a
binding canyon of predominantly hydrophobic side chains
(Figure 2b). However, polar residues, including the catalytic
ones, surrounded the hydrolyzable ester moiety. Indeed, the
side chains of Ser48 and Asn90 H-bonded the carboxylic
oxygen during the simulation (16 and 29%, respectively).
Step 1, the Acylation Reaction Mechanism Is Aided
by Precise H-Bond Interactions. As noted above, the most
recurrent binding mode of substrate 1 in the active site cleft of
AoCut did not show the insertion of the ester into the
oxyanion hole. Yet, nearby residues, such as Ser48 and Asn90,
could establish H-bonds to the carboxylic oxygen. We explored
the reaction mechanism and reconstructed the associated free
energy profile by means of umbrella sampling QM/MM
simulations, starting from two different configurations, named
1_A and 1_B hereafter, belonging to the most recurrent
binding mode of the butanediol−succinate−butanediol moiety
of compound 1 in the active site cleft of AoCut. These two
configurations displayed different H-bonding patterns with the
ester moiety of the substrate. QM/MM simulations of the
reactant states confirmed that both poses were stable, with C
Suc
remaining close to the nucleophilic side chain oxygen of
Ser126. Notably, the free energy profile of 1_A showed a
barrier (20.2 ± 0.6 kcal mol
−1
) that was smaller than that of
1_B (24.5 ± 0.7 kcal mol
−1
). This result can likely be ascribed
to the number of H-bonds formed at the transition state by
O
Suc
. We observed three H-bonds for 1_A, while we observed
only two for 1_B. In the following, we describe the reaction
mechanism of the lower energy profile starting from 1_A (see
Figure 3), while that from 1_B is described in the Supporting
Information (Section 6).
For 1_A, the reaction proceeds with the nucleophilic oxygen
of Ser126 (O
Ser
in Scheme 1) approaching the carboxylic
carbon C
Suc
of the ester moiety (Figure 3c). The free energy
profile displays an intermediate (I1) at CV1 = 0.0 Å, that is,
when the forming and breaking bonds are of equal length
(∼1.5 Å, Figure 3a). This state corresponds to a shallow
minimum on the free energy profile. The first transition state
(TS1) is found at CV1 = ∼−0.5 Å, corresponding to a still
formed C
Suc
−O
But
bond (∼1.4 Å, Figure 3), while O
Ser
is ∼1.8
Å from C
Suc
. At this stage, the transfer of a proton from Ser126
to His194 takes place (Figure 3a,c). The second transition
state (TS2) is located at CV1 = ∼0.3 Å, corresponding to the
breaking of the C
Suc
−O
But
bond (∼1.8 Å). This occurs when
His194, after a change in H-bonding partner, delivers a proton
to the leaving O
But
(Figure 3a,c). Notably, TS1 is higher in free
energy by 2.0 kcal mol
−1
(Figure 3a) than TS2. Also, a pattern
of H-bond interaction at the oxyanion hole was formed as the
reaction proceeded for CV1 > −0.9 Å (Figure 3a). However,
the reactant state did not display such H-bonding interactions.
At both transition states, the backbone −NH− of Ser48 and
Gln127 interacted with O
Suc
and, in addition, the latter H-
bonded the side chain hydroxyl of Ser48 (Figure 3c). Thus, the
O
Suc
of the ester moiety forms three H-bonds at both TS1 and
TS2. At CV1 > 0.55 Å, we verified that the systems were
committed to the product states by releasing the restraints and
observing the evolution of the systems, which indeed formed
the expected acyl-enzyme adduct and the newly created
alcohol molecule still bound to the enzymatic cleft (Figure S8).

Site. The acylation reaction produced an acyl-enzyme adduct,
in which C

created alcohol R

with the alcoholic terminus close to the side chain of Ser126

1 μs equilibrium MD simulations. This revealed two aspects of
how exactly the covalently bound PBS-like fragment sits at the
active site cleft of the enzyme. First, O
Suc
forms H-bond
interactions with the oxyanion hole more easily than does
compound 1 (Figure S14). This seems primarily due to the
spatial proximity imposed by the covalent bond formed by the
substrate with Ser126. Second, the substrate chain adopts
distinct poses in the active site cleft, occupying either the
“upper” side or the “lower” side of the cleft (Figure 4a,b). This
occurrence has relevance to the progress of the reaction, given
that water is excluded from approaching the carboxylic carbon
from the side of His194 when the PBS-like chain occupies the
same side (i.e., the “lower” side) of the cleft as that of His194
(Figure 4c). However, the conformational rearrangement
appears to take place on the hundreds of nanoseconds time
scale, and thus, it is not expected to impact the catalytic rate
(Figure 4d).

energy profile for the release of the product R

H along a
collective variable (CV2) akin to the one used for the acylation
step (Figure 5b). Simulations were started from a configuration
in which the PBS-like chain occupies the “upper” side of the
cleft, which allows a water molecule to consistently hydrogen
bond to His194 (Figure 4c). Such water molecule is in close
proximity to C
Suc
and can perform a nucleophilic attack on
C
Suc
, with His194 relaying a proton from the nucleophilic
water to the side chain oxygen O
Ser
of Ser126. The PBS
fragment is released as a carboxylic acid. The free energy
profile (Figure 5a) presents a similar shape to the acylation
reaction, with two transition states (TS3 at CV2 = − 0.3 and
TS4 at 0.4 Å). These are close in free energy (13.2 ± 0.5 and
13.6 ± 0.6 kcal mol
−1
, respectively), flanking a metastable
intermediate (I2) at CV2 = 0.0 Å corresponding to a
tetrahedral intermediate (Figure 5c), in which the forming
and breaking bonds are of the same length (∼1.5 Å). The
proton relay occurs through His194, and it occurs between the
two transition states. At TS3, the C
Suc
−O
Ser
bond is
maintained (∼1.4 Å), while the C
Suc
−O
Wat
distance is ∼1.7
Å. At this point, a proton is transferred from the nucleophilic
water to His194, and it remains bound to the histidine until
the system reaches TS4. At this point, a shift in the H-bonding
partner allows the delivery of the proton to Ser126, favoring
the lengthening of the C
Suc
−O
Ser
bond (∼1.8 Å). Notably, the
free energy barrier of the deacylation step is lower than that of
the acylation step by ∼6 kcal mol
−1
. This is likely due to the
interactions of the ester group with the oxyanion hole: the
backbone −NH− group of Ser48 and Gln127 interacts with
the carboxylic oxygen throughout the reaction (Figure 5a,c
fourth panel; in section 9 of the Supporting Information, we
report, for comparison, the free energy profile computed from
an alternative acyl-enzyme configuration), while these H-bonds
form as the reaction proceeded during the acylation step.

DISCUSSION
Molecular dynamics simulations, based on both molecular
mechanical (MM) and hybrid quantum mechanical (QM)/
MM potentials, were used to investigate in atomic detail the
mechanism of hydrolysis of a polybutylene succinate (PBS)
oligomer, namely, a butanediol−succinate−butanediol se-
quence capped at the termini with acetyl groups (compound
1 in Figure 2). This reaction is catalyzed by the cutinase
enzyme from A. oryzae (AoCut). To the best of our knowledge,
this is the first mechanistic study addressing the hydrolysis of
an aliphatic polyester by a fungal cutinase.
Enzymatic reactions are characterized by the recognition of
the substrate, which binds at the catalytic site, and the
subsequent chemical reaction, which transforms the substrate
into products.
55
To investigate this catalytic process, we
initially used dynamic docking to explore the binding of the
smaller compound 2 to the active site of AoCut.
56
Then, we
repeatedly (10 times) grew compound 1 from 2 in situ using
the alchemically enhanced sampling (ACES) method. These
computations were followed by equilibrium MD simulations
(each 250 ns long for a cumulative 2.5 μs simulation time) to
relax the ligand-enzyme complex. Conformational analysis of
these trajectories revealed that compound 1 fits the extended
cleft on the surface of the enzyme, laying at a hydrophobic
binding canyon that, however, includes few polar residues,
including the catalytic triad at the bottom of the cleft (Figure
2). Simulations show that the flexible PBS-like oligomer adapts
to the active site cleft (Figure 2), suggesting that other linear
polyesters may fit the cleft. Indeed, AoCut has been reported
to fully hydrolyze PBSA,
29
while PLA, which presents a methyl
group protruding from the backbone chain, is only partially
processed. The hydrolyzable ester moiety of the PBS-like
substrate accommodates at the catalytic triad. Interestingly,
here, the carboxylic oxygen of the ester moiety does not
approach the backbone NH- groups of the oxyanion hole. Yet,
it can form H-bonds to the nearby polar residues, namely,
Ser48 and Asn90. The catalytic triad Ser126-His194-Asp181
maintains the expected alignment necessary for activating the
nucleophilic hydroxyl, in both apo- and substrate-bound states.
In the apo form, AoCut displays limited fluctuations of the
segments comprising residues 87−93 and 186−194, both
flanking the catalytic site and composing the outer part of the
cleft (Figure S3). The two segments face each other and
contact residues Asn90/Ala91 and Leu188, narrowing the cleft
(Figures S17b and S18). Indeed, we observed that the PBS-like
oligomer does not insert into this part of the groove (Figure
S6). Thus, we put forward the idea that the mutant Leu188Ala
could grant access to this part of the groove, possibly resulting
in a more extended binding of the polyester chain and/or
favoring the “upper” configuration of the acyl-enzyme adduct,
in turn enhancing catalytic efficiency.
Such catalytically competent conformations were used to
model the chemical reaction by means of QM/MM MD
simulations at the DFT(B3LYP)/6−31G**/AMBERff level of
theory. Notably, such calculations were performed with the
GPU-enabled electronic structure code QUICK integrated
with the MD engine SANDER from the AmberTools23
package.
45,57
As a result, multiscale QM/MM MD simulations
could be performed by using the popular hybrid B3LYP DFT
functional. Thanks to the performance of the code,
30
here we
could sample and reconstruct the free energy profiles of both
the acylation and deacylation reaction steps and, importantly,
further explore the acylation mechanism starting from two
different conformations. In our hands, with 77 atoms in the
QM region, using the 6−31G(d,p) basis set and the B3LYP
functional, this QM/MM implementation performed with
competitive timing on high end GPUs (24.6 s/MD-step on a
single NVIDIA A100, 39.5 s/MD-step on a NVIDIA V100)
and respectable timing on consumer GPU (115.7 s/MD-step
on a single NVIDIA GeForce RTX2080). This opens to a
broader application of such an efficient code that, notably,
incorporates long-range electrostatic corrections, not available
in other ab initio codes interfaced with SANDER for QM/MM
calculations.
30,31
Furthermore, umbrella sampling simulations
were performed using the PLUMED interface to SANDER.
58
It is worth noting that this procedure enables the application of
any enhanced sampling technique in the PLUMED repertoire
at the DFT/AMBERff level of theory.
Our results indicate that the acylation step is rate-limiting,
with a free energy barrier of 20.2 ± 0.6 kcal mol
−1
, ∼6 kcal
mol
−1
higher than that of the deacylation step (13.6 ± 0.6 kcal
mol
−1
). No experimental kinetic data are available to validate
the computational estimate. Yet, the free energy barrier aligns
with computational studies investigating polyethylene tereph-
thalate hydrolysis by the PETase cutinase at a similar level of
theory.
20
Interestingly, in the most recurrent catalytically
competent binding mode of compound 1, the carboxylic
oxygen of the hydrolyzable moiety does not form hydrogen
bonds to the oxyanion hole backbone −NH− groups. These
interactions are, however, recovered as the reaction proceeds.
In this way, such H-bonds contribute to stabilizing the
tetrahedral species formed by the nucleophilic attack on the
carboxylic carbon. Additional H-bonds are established by the
carboxylic oxygen with nearby Ser48, which further stabilizes
the tetrahedral species. Interestingly, we explored the
energetics of the acylation reaction starting from different
configurations, corroborating that the higher the number of H-
bonds formed by the carbonylic oxygen in the transition state
region, the lower the free energy barrier (Figures 3 and 5 and
Supporting Information Section 6). Given the importance of
stabilizing the developing negative charge on the carboxylic
oxygen at the transition state,
28
we would argue that the
formation of a suboptimal number of H-bonds at the oxyanion
hole (possibly due to steric hindrance at the substrate/enzyme
interface) would likely generate an increase in the activation
barrier. Also, for both the acylation and deacylation steps, the
free energy profile shows a metastable tetrahedral intermediate,
flanked by transition states that coincide with the proton
transfer events (Figures 3 and 5): in TS1 (acylation) and TS3
(deacylation), a proton is abstracted by His194 from the
nucleophile (Ser126 in acylation and a water molecule in
deacylation). In TS2 and TS4, a proton is delivered to the
leaving group (the alcohol R
1
O
But
H in acylation and Ser126 in
deacylation) by protonated His194 after a switch in the H-
bonding partner. Interestingly, during these proton relay
events, the H-bond between His194 and Asp181 becomes
shorter, and at times, the shared proton is transferred to
Asp181 (Figure S10). In the acylation step, TS1 is higher in
energy than TS2 by 2 kcal mol
−1
(20.2 ± 0.6 and 18.2 ± 0.7

4668
kcal mol
−1
, respectively). In the deacylation free energy profile,
TS3 and TS4 are similar in energy (13.2 ± 0.5 and 13.6 ± 0.6
kcal mol
−1
, respectively). It is worth noting that the proton
transfer events were not explicitly included in the reaction
coordinate, which was approximated using the distances of the
nucleophilic and leaving groups from the electrophilic center
(as done in ref 20). These proton transfer events coincide with
the location of the transition states (Figure S19), and their
contribution is projected and accounted for (within the
limitations of the sampled time) in the free energy profiles
along CV1 and CV2. To investigate the explicit inclusion of
the proton transfer events in the reaction coordinate (see refs
59 and 22−24), we adopted the adaptive string method at the
DFTB3 level of theory, closely following Garcia-Meseguer et
al.,
23
who used this method to study the reaction mechanism of
polyester hydrolysis by PETase. These results are described in
section 9 of the Supporting Information.
As noted above, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first
computational mechanistic study addressing the hydrolysis of
an aliphatic polyester by a fungal cutinase. On the contrary, the
hydrolysis of PET, an aromatic polyester, by the PETase
enzyme from the bacterium I. sakaiensis has been the focus of
recent mechanistic studies, which we will briefly recall here for
comparison. Both AoCut and PETase display an α/β fold
(Figure 1), with AoCut having a shorter sequence. A
comparison of the structures reveals that the groove at the
active site of AoCut is more constricted than that in PETase
(Figure S17a). The open and shallower cleft in PETase may be
advantageous to bind the bulkier and more rigid PET chain (to
our knowledge, the activity of AoCut toward PET has not been
reported). Furthermore, the shape of the cleft differs in the two
enzymes, being linear in AoCut while L-shaped in PETase
(Figure S17b). In AoCut, the residues in contact with the PBS-
like oligomer include hydrophobic (Ala47, Leu87, Pro88,
Ala91, Val183, Leu188, Val190, and Phe195) and polar
residues (Ser48, Asn90, Tyr125, Gln127, Thr156, and the
catalytic Ser126 and His194�Figure 2). Compared to
PETase, where Trp 159 and Trp185 were proposed to interact
with the aromatic rings of PET,
24
no Trp residues are present
at the AoCut cleft.
Fernandes and co-workers
20
used DFT(PBE)/MM umbrella
sampling simulations to model the hydrolysis of a PET dimer.
For both acylation and deacylation steps, the tetrahedral
species resulting from the nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl
carbon corresponds to the transition state of the free energy
profile rather than a metastable intermediate as found here. In
a related study,
21
the authors used a similar approach to study
the MHETase enzyme, using the B3LYP DFT functional. In
this case, the tetrahedral species appeared as a high-energy
intermediate. It thus seems that such a tetrahedral species can
be differently located on the free energy surface, also
depending on the DFT functional. Despite this evidence, the
reaction proceeds along the canonical esterase mechanism with
an activation barrier of the rate-determining step similar to the
one found here (20 kcal mol
−1
for PETase and 19 kcal mol
−1
for MHETase). Compared to the present study, for which no
structural information was available on the Michaelis complex,
both these studies benefited from X-ray structures of the
enzymes in complex with substrate 1-(2-hydroxyethyl) 4-
methyl terephthalate (as for mutated PETase lacking the
catalytic Ser, PDB ID: 5HX3) or a nonhydrolyzable substrate
analogue (as for MHETase PDB ID: 6QGA). Therefore, our
case also demonstrates that the ACES approach may
conveniently be used to couple a flexible substrate (such as
compound 1) to the active site cleft of AoCut.
Boneta et al.
22
compared the reactivity PETase and an
engineered leaf compost cutinase (LCC-ICCG)
13
toward a
PET dimer (MHET
2
) using AM1/MM umbrella sampling
further corrected with M06−2X DFT energy evaluations. The
enzymes displayed similar free energy surfaces featuring a
tetrahedral intermediate in both acylation and deacylation
steps, as found in the present study. Acylation turned out to be
rate-limiting, with barriers of 18.9 kcal mol
−1
for PETase and
21.1 kcal mol
−1
for LCC-ICCG. They also modeled the
reactivity of PETase toward MHET
3
, revealing no dependence
of the free energy surface on the length of the polymeric chain.
On the other hand, Garcia-Meseguer et al.
23
compared the
reactivity of PETase and FAST-PETase, an engineered variant
with enhanced hydrolytic activity.
14
Using the adaptive string
method followed by umbrella sampling simulations at the
DFTB3/MM level and a trimer PET substrate model, they
rationalized the enhanced activity of FAST-PETase in terms of
increased basicity of Asp206 (of the catalytic triad), which in
turn modulates the properties of the catalytic His resulting in a
lower activation barrier (12.1 kcal mol
−1
for FAST-PETase
compared to 16.5 kcal mol
−1
for the wild-type PETase in the
rate-limiting acylation step). Notably, the atomic rearrange-
ments along the string are consistent with those observed in
this study of AoCut. Finally, Burgin et al.
24
recently applied
transition path sampling at the DFTB3/MM level to
investigate the reaction mechanism of a PET dimer by wild-
type PETase. The reactive trajectories displayed a moving
histidine mechanism for proton relay, as observed in the
present study, and highlighted the flexibility of an aromatic
tryptophan side chain (Trp185 in IsPETase, corresponding to
Thr156 in AoCut) as a key element of catalysis. The free
energy profiles were reconstructed via umbrella sampling
simulation along a reaction coordinate identified through
likelihood maximization. Deacylation was predicted as rate-
limiting with a barrier of ∼18 kcal mol
−1
. However, the
tetrahedral species correspond to transition states on both
acylation and deacylation profiles rather than to metastable
intermediates as found in our study. Nevertheless, all of these
mechanistic studies align with our results for the overall
canonical esterase mechanism. The reported activation barriers
are in the 12 to 20 kcal mol
−1
range although computed with
different QM methods, ranging from semiempirical approaches
(AM1 and DFTB3) to DFT (PBE). The nature of the
tetrahedral species resulting from the nucleophilic attack was
predicted to be either a metastable intermediate or a transition
state of the acylation or deacylation steps. This discrepancy is
possibly related to the QM level of theory. However, the size of
the QM region and the definition of the reaction coordinate
may play a role in modulating the stability of such a chemical
species. Besides the mechanistic details, which may (slightly)
differ due to, for example, a diverse enzyme/substrate
combination and distinct methodologies, these studies,
together with the present one, provide a consistent picture of
the well-established esterase mechanism used for the hydrolysis
of non-natural polyesters by cutinases. When the ester group
can approach the catalytic triad, the reaction proceeds with
activation barriers that align with those expected for enzymatic
catalysis. This may constitute a guiding principle for future
engineering studies aimed at improving the hydrolysis of
polyesters other than PET and PBS.

Using the popular hybrid B3LYP functional, we thus
obtained barriers consistent with previous works (20.2 ± 0.6
kcal mol
−1
for acylation and 13.6 ± 0.6 kcal mol
−1
for
deacylation), with the tetrahedral species corresponding to a
metastable intermediate for both acylation and deacylation. We
compared the free energy profiles from umbrella sampling
simulations of the acylation and deacylation steps performed at
the B3LYP/AMBER and DFTB3/AMBER levels of theory
(Figure S9). As far as it concerns the hydrolysis of a PBS-like
oligomer by AoCut, both methods predict a tetrahedral
intermediate, albeit the free energy barrier is considerably
lower at the DFTB3 level (11.8 ± 0.5 kcal mol
−1
). Also, in
contrast to earlier studies,
20−24
we found that the PBS-like
oligomer binds to the active cleft without immediately
inserting the carbonylic oxygen into the oxyanion hole.
Nevertheless, precise interactions are established as the
reaction proceeds. These interactions were then further
enriched by an H-bond interaction with Ser48. The additional
H-bond interaction formed by Ser48 lowers the activation
barrier (as demonstrated by computing the free energy profiles
in the presence and absence of this interaction), suggesting
that mutant Ser48Ala may be less efficient than the wild-type
enzyme. It is worth noting that no H-bonding interactions
other than those from the oxyanion hole were reported for the
carbonylic oxygen of the ester moiety in PETase in the
aforementioned studies.
20,22−24
The present study, and similarly the mechanistic studies on
PETase,
20,22−24
used model substrates composed of a small
number of building blocks rather than the actual polyester.
This approach facilitates the modeling and provides insight
into how a segment of the polymer chain would fit the active
site cleft of cutinases. However, we emphasize that the actual
substrate is a solid polymer. Necessarily, a more extended
enzyme−substrate interface forms than the one investigated
with model substrates. Because of this, the kinetics of substrate
binding cannot be inferred from that of model substrates, such
as the one investigated here. Molecular details of how the
cutinase approaches the polymer surface have yet to be
unravelled. Recent studies revealed that the coexpression of
hydrophobins, which adsorb on solid hydrophobic materials,
may be involved in the recruitment of hydrolytic enzymes.
60
Overall, here, we present mechanistic insights for the
hydrolysis of an aliphatic polyester by fungal cutinases.
Aliphatic polyesters are considered more degradable than
aromatic polyesters, such that they are often labeled as
biodegradable. Yet, the time required for their environmental
degradation is substantial and thus demands efficient and cost-
effective degradation approaches. In this regard, carboxylic
ester hydrolases (EC 3.1.1) are enzymes evolved to hydrolyze
ester bonds, an activity that motivated their adoption by the
chemical industry to drive biochemical transformations.
25,61
The use of regioselective enzymes constitutes a route toward a
closed-loop recycling strategy that would help drastically
reduce plastic waste accumulation in the environment. Indeed,
an intense research effort was placed in recent years in
engineering cutinases to improve their catalytic efficiencies and
thermostabilities. Successful studies based on the rational
design of bacterial cutinases have demonstrated the feasibility
of this approach for PET,
13,14
a recalcitrant aromatic polyester
highly used in packaging (e.g., water bottles). Necessarily, this
rational approach to tuning the enzyme activity must be
extended to the hydrolysis of other types of polyesters. Fungi,
in contrast to bacteria, induce essential alteration of the
mechanical properties of the plastic by the growth of the
fungus between the polymer layers, thus weakening the fabric
body.
62,63
This cracking action constitutes an advantage over
bacteria, which adhere only to the plastic surface. A. oryzae is a
common filamentous fungus used in traditional Japanese
fermentation products (sake, shoyu, and miso) and is classified
by the FDA as generally recognized as safe. AoCut has been
reported to hydrolyze aliphatic polyesters PBS and PBSA and
to a lesser extent PLA.
29
In this context, we reveal the
mechanistic details of both the substrate recognition and
chemical transformation of PBS by AoCut. We clarify the
fundamental interactions for catalysis. The same computational
strategy could be employed to explore and define the coupling
and reactivity of AoCut to other polyesters, providing valuable
insights to guide the rational engineering of enzyme variants
for the hydrolysis of polyesters of different compositions.
■
CONCLUSIONS
The hydrolysis of a polybutylene succinate (PBS) oligomer by
a fungal cutinase (AoCut) has been studied in atomic detail by
means of state-of-the-art molecular modeling techniques,
including dynamic docking and advanced alchemical trans-
formations. Also, we run extended QM(B3LYP)/MM
umbrella sampling simulations to sample potential reaction
paths. In this way, we showed that three units of the aliphatic
polyester fit the continuous groove across the active site,
interacting with hydrophobic side chains. The substrate ester
moiety approaches the catalytic residues. Then, it is hydrolyzed
according to a canonical esterase mechanism in which the
nucleophilic Ser126 is assisted by His194 and Asp181 residues.
The free energy barrier of the acylation step is higher (20.2 ±
0.6 kcal mol
−1
) than that of the deacylation step (13.6 ± 0.6
kcal mol
−1
). Alcohol release from the acylezyme intermediate
occurs on a fast (ns) time scale, suggesting that the acylation
step is rate-limiting. These findings align with the exper-
imentally determined biodegradation activity of AoCut toward
PBS and provide guiding principles to aid the rational design of
cutinases with improved activity toward other types of
polyesters.
