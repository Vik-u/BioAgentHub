RESEARCH
Engineering CRISPR interference system 
in Klebsiella pneumoniae for attenuating lactic 
acid synthesis
Jingxuan Wang1, Peng Zhao1, Ying Li2, Lida Xu1 and Pingfang Tian1*
Abstract 
Background: Klebsiella pneumoniae is a promising industrial species for bioproduction of bulk chemicals such as 
1,3-propanediol, 2,3-butanediol and 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP). However, lactic acid is a troublesome by-product 
when optimizing for 3-HP production. Therefore, it is highly desirable to minimize lactic acid.
Results: Here, we show that lactic acid synthesis can be largely blocked by an engineered CRISPR interference 
(CRISPRi) system in K. pneumoniae. EGFP was recruited as a reporter of this CRISPRi system. Fluorescence assay of this 
CRISPRi system showed that enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expression level was repressed by 85–90%. To 
further test this CRISPRi system, guide RNAs were designed to individually or simultaneously target four lactate-pro-
ducing enzyme genes. Results showed that all lactate-producing enzyme genes were significantly repressed. Notably, 
d-lactate dehydrogenase (ldhA) was shown to be the most influential enzyme for lactic acid formation in micro-aero-
bic conditions, as inhibiting ldhA alone led to lactic acid level similar to simultaneously repressing four genes. In shake 
flask cultivation, the strain coexpressing puuC (an aldehyde dehydrogenase catalyzing 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde 
to 3-HP) and dCas9-sgRNA inhibiting ldhA produced 1.37-fold 3-HP relative to the reference strain. Furthermore, in 
bioreactor cultivation, this CRISPRi strain inhibiting ldhA produced 36.7 g/L 3-HP , but only generated 1 g/L lactic acid. 
Clearly, this engineered CRISPRi system largely simplified downstream separation of 3-HP from its isomer lactic acid, 
an extreme challenge for 3-HP bioprocess.
Conclusions: This study offers a deep understanding of lactic acid metabolism in diverse species, and we believe 
that this CRISPRi system will facilitate biomanufacturing and functional genome studies of K. pneumoniae or beyond.

Background
For bioproduction of chemicals, byproducts are prob -
lematic because they not only consume cellular resources 
but also entangle downstream separation. Conventional 
genetic engineering strategies to attenuate byproducts 
formation mainly rely on deletion or repression of their 
biosynthesis genes [ 1–4]. However, these approaches in 
most cases compromise cell growth which in turn ham -
pers the production of desired metabolites [ 5]. In recent 
years, Klebsiella pneumoniae   has attracted much atten -
tion because it can naturally convert glycerol to a range 
of economically important bulk chemicals including 
1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO), 2,3-butanediol (2,3-BDO), 
3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) and d-lactic acid [ 1, 2, 
6–11]. Glycerol metabolism in K. pneumoniae is medi -
ated by the dha and glp regulons in anaerobic or micro-
aerobic conditions [ 6, 9, 12]. The dha regulon involves 
glycerol reduction and oxidation pathways (Fig. 1). In the 
reduction pathways, glycerol is converted to 3-hydroxy -
propionaldehyde (3-HPA) by GDHt (encoded by dhaB 
cluster, GenBank No. U30903). Next, 3-HPA is converted 
to 1,3-PDO by 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase (PDOR, 
encoded by dhaT) [13]. 3-HPA is also converted to 3-HP

by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) with  NAD+ as a 
cofactor [9]. In the glycerol oxidation pathways, a series 
of metabolites such as ATP ,  NAD+, 2,3-BDO and lactic 
acid are generated to sustain cell growth and benefit 1,3-
PDO and 3-HP production [9]. Of various metabolites, 
lactic acid is the major byproduct in the production of 
1,3-PDO, 2,3-BDO and 3-HP [14]. The formation of lactic 
acid not only consumes carbon source but also entangles 
downstream separation [2]. It is extremely challenging to 
separate lactic acid (2-hydroxy propionic acid) from 3-HP 
(3-hydroxy propionic acid) because they are isomers. On 
the other hand, although the formation of lactic acid con
-
sumes carbon flux, it also augments carbon flux toward 
glycerol reduction pathways. Especially, when dissolved 
oxygen is insufficient, lactic acid synthesis leads to  NAD
+ 
regeneration which in return drives 3-HP production 
because  NAD
+ is the cofactor of aldehyde dehydrogenase 
that catalyzes 3-HPA to 3-HP [7, 9]. In other words, 3-HP 
production consumes  NAD+, and the lack of  NAD+ in 
turn necessitates lactic acid synthesis. Clearly, there is

interdependence between lactic acid formation and 3-HP 
production. Hence, knockdown instead of deletion of lac-
tic acid pathways is beneficial for 3-HP production.
CRISPR technology opens avenue for simultaneous 
knockdown or knockout of multiple genes due to an array 
of single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) that direct dCas9 or Cas9 
to interference or edit target genes [15–19]. The dCas9-
sgRNA-based CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) tools 
mainly include CRISPR activation and CRISPR repres
-
sion [20, 21]. The dCas9-sgRNA complex activates gene 
expression when dCas9 is fused with the omega subu -
nit of RNA polymerase, while it represses gene expres -
sion when dCas9 binds a promoter or an open reading 
frame (ORF) [21]. The Cas9-based DNA cleavage largely 
relies on DNA repair mechanisms including homologous 
recombination in prokaryotes and non-homologous end 
joining (NHEJ) in eukaryotes [17]. Unlike Cas9-based 
DNA editing, CRISPRi is independent of DNA repair and 
thus can be easily applied in microbes lacking the NHEJ 
pathway or for which no efficient homologous recom
-
bination approach is available. Furthermore, compared 
with CRISPR editing that may lead to slowed cell growth 
or even cell death, CRISPRi could be more appropriate 
for modulating multiple genes.
In view of above information, we anticipated that CRIS
-
PRi may be ideal for modulating lactic acid metabolism 
which is subjected to multiple factors. To validate this 
prediction, in this study we developed CRISPRi system 
in K. pneumoniae. Detailed analysis of glycerol consump
-
tion, cell growth, metabolites formation and gene tran -
scription was to systematically assess the performance 
of CRISPRi system in K. pneumoniae. Shake-flask and 
bioreactor cultivation of the recombinant K. pneumo
-
niae strain harboring CRISPRi vectors (hereafter refers 
to as CRISPRi strain) were to determine the key enzymes 
affecting lactic acid synthesis. Overall, this study was to 
exploit CRISPRi system for basic research and metabolic 
engineering of K. pneumoniae.
Results
Fluorescence assay of dCas9‑gRNA‑mediated transcription 
repression in K. pneumoniae
The dCas9 was derived from Streptococcus pyogenes, 
and CRISPRi system was developed to dissect lactic acid 
metabolism. To determine whether it functioned in K. 
pneumoniae, EGFP was employed as a reporter under tac 
promoter. To ensure CRISPRi efficiency, two candidate 
guide RNAs  T
1 and  T2 toward the different regions of tac 
promoter were designed and chemically synthesized. The 
CRISPRi vector with non-targeting sgRNA was used as 
a control. The fluorescence intensity of single strain was 
calculated as the total  fluorescence  intensity  divided 
by  OD
600  value. Results showed that EGFP expression 
was significantly down-regulated by CRISPRi system 
(Fig.  2). Compared with the control strain NT with 
non-targeting guide RNA, strains T1 and T2 showed a 
remarkable decrease in the fluorescence intensity even if 
anhydrotetracycline (aTc) was absent. Strains  T
1 and  T2 
respectively exhibited 65 and 23% inhibition on EGFP 
when aTc was absent. Notably,  T
1 and  T2 respectively 
displayed 85 and 90% inhibition on EGFP level when 
aTc was added into medium. Overall these results indi
-
cated that CRISPRi system significantly repressed EGFP 
expression, although tet promoter failed to tightly con
-
trol dCas9 expression in K. pneumoniae. Namely, there 
existed leaky expression of dCas9.
Repression of lactate‑producing enzyme genes by CRISPRi 
system
To further validate the CRISPRi system, it was harnessed 
to repress lactate-producing enzyme genes. In K. pneu -
moniae, many enzymes potentially contribute to lactic 
acid synthesis, including l-lactate dehydrogenase (pmd), 
d-lactate dehydrogenase (ldhA), lactaldehyde dehy
-
drogenase (aldA) and methylglyoxal (mgsA ). To deter -
mine the key enzymes affecting lactic acid formation, an 
array of sgRNAs targeting enzyme genes were designed 
and chemically synthesized. For each lactate-producing 
enzyme gene, two or three candidate sgRNAs were sub
-
jected to screening. The sgRNAs were designed by using 
online software CRISPR direct (http://crispr.dbcls.jp/
doc/) [22]. In principle, sgRNA sequence should tar
-
get transcription initiation site especially that in non-
template strand [23]. In addition, sgRNA sequence 
was used as a query to search against K. pneumoniae

genome to avoid targeting homologous sequence and 
off-target. The secondary structure of sgRNAs were 
predicted by using online Quikfold algorithm from the 
UNAFold package [24]. All engineered vectors were con
-
firmed by sequencing. The CRISPRi vectors targeting 
different lactate-producing enzyme genes were trans
-
formed into the previously engineered 3-HP-produc -
ing strain Kp(ptac-puuC) [2], resulting in recombinant 
strain Kp(ptac-puuC + placiL), Kp(ptac-puuC + placiD), 
Kp(ptac-puuC + placiA) and Kp(ptac-puuC + placiM). 
Next, quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was per
-
formed to examine CRISPRi efficiency toward lactate-
producing enzyme genes. Results showed that guide 
RNAs L1 and L2 failed to significantly inhibit pmd gene 
(Fig.  3a). However, for three CRISPRi strains targeting 
ldhA, aldA and mgsA, at least one sgRNA showed inhibi
-
tion activity (Fig.  3b–d). To simultaneously repress four 
lactate-producing enzyme genes, four well-functioned 
sgRNAs (L3 for pmd, D1 for ldhA, A2 for aldA, M2 for 
mgsA) were joined together to form a new vector named 
placiMALD. To investigate the performance of CRIS
-
PRi system, we engineered a vector named Kp(ptac-
puuC + placiMALD), where vectors dCas9-sgRNA and 
puuC were coexpressed. The qRT-PCR assay showed that 
CRISPRi vector placiMALD significantly repressed all 
lactate-producing enzyme genes (Fig. 3e).
Shake flask cultivation of the CRISPRi strains
To overproduce 3-HP and attenuate lactic acid for -
mation, PuuC was coexpressed with dCas9. To do so, 
we engineered five recombinant strains designated 
Kp(ptac-puuC + placiL), Kp(ptac-puuC + placiD), 
Kp(ptac-puuC + placiA), Kp(ptac-puuC + placiM) and 
Kp(ptac-puuC + placiMALD). These strains were fer
-
mented in micro-aerobic conditions with Kp(ptac-
puuC + pdCas9) as the control. In 15 h cultivation, these 
strains showed retarded growth and postponed log phase 
with exception of the strain Kp(ptac-puuC + placiM), 
where “placiM” indicates CRISPRi vector targeting 
mgsA gene (Fig.  4a). Interestingly, in stationary phase, 
all these strains demonstrated similar  OD
600 value with 
the control Kp(ptac-puuC + pdCas9). However, due to 
harboring of two vectors pSg and ptac-puuC + Cas9, 
glycerol consumption was largely retarded (Fig.  4b). 
For lactic acid formation, the strain harboring CRIS -
PRi vector targeting mgsA had highest lactic acid peak 
(Fig. 4c). In contrast, the strains Kp(ptac-puuC + placiD) 
and Kp(ptac-puuC + placiMALD) produced less lac -
tic acid (Fig.  4c). For other strains, lactic acid accumu -
lated in log phase but declined in stationary phase. In 
addition, strains Kp(ptac-puuC + placiD) and Kp(ptac-
puuC + placiMALD) produced more 3-HP and 1,3-
PDO at 30  h than other strains did. Only the strain 
Kp(ptac-puuC + placiM) produced less 3-HP than the 
control. For acetic acid and 2,3-BDO production, no sig
-
nificant difference was observed in all strains (Fig. 4d).
Fed‑batch cultivation of CRISPRi strains
As mentioned, the strains Kp(ptac-puuC + placiD) and 
Kp(ptac-puuC + placiMALD) produced less lactic acid 
in shake flasks relative to other strains (Fig.  4c). To fur-
ther investigate the performance of CRISPRi system, the 
above two strains were independently cultivated in 5  L 
bioreactor. Results showed that only trace amount of lac
-
tic acid was generated during entire fermentation pro -
cess (Fig. 5b, c). In addition, due to PuuC overexpression, 
the strain Kp(ptac-puuC + placiD) generated 36.7  g/L 
3-HP at 36  h (Fig.  5b), with 41.7% of glycerol conver -
sion ratio (GCR) and 1.02 g/L/h of productivity (Table 1). 
The GCR is calculated as the each metabolite concen -
tration divided by the total glycerol concentration. We 
also found that the strain Kp(ptac-puuC + placiMALD) 
harboring CRISPRi vector targeting all four lactate-pro
-
ducing enzyme genes produced 26.9  g/L 3-HP at 48  h 
(Fig.  5c), with GCR of 34.6% and 0.56  g/L/h of produc
-
tivity (Table 2). Compared with Kp(ptac-puuC + placiD), 
the strain Kp(ptac-puuC + placiMALD) produced more 
acetic acid to compensate cofactor for cell growth. For 
above two strains, the overall conversion ratio from glyc
-
erol to major metabolites was around 60–70%, indicating 
that partial carbon source flowed into other pathways. 
It should be pointed out that CRISPRi system imposed 
a burden on cell growth. This finding is consistent with 
other study [25]. As Fig.  5 shown, the highest  OD
600 was 
only 20–30.
Dissecting interactions of lactate‑producing enzyme genes 
by CRISPRi strains
A number of enzymes potentially contribute to lactic acid 
synthesis (Additional file  1: Fig. S1). To decipher their 
interactions, a total of four CRISPRi strains targeting 
different lactic acid-producing enzyme genes were sub
-
jected to qRT-PCR analysis. Results showed that repress -
ing anyone of lactic acid-producing enzyme genes led to 
up-regulation or down-regulation of other enzyme genes 
(Fig.  6). For example, in strain Kp(ptac-puuC + placiL) 
targeting pmd gene, both ldhA and aldA genes were 
upregulated, while mgsA  gene was less affected (Fig.  6a). 
By contrast, the mgsA  gene was significantly upregu
-
lated in both Kp(ptac-puuC + placiD) and Kp(ptac-
puuC + placiA) (Fig.  6b, c), where ldhA and aldA genes 
were respectively targeted by CRISPRi. In strain Kp(ptac-
puuC + placiM) targeting mgsA, both pmb and aldA 
genes were downregulated (Fig. 6d).

Discussion
In this work, we developed CRISPRi system in K. pneu-
moniae to attenuate lactic acid formation. The dCas9 
was derived from S. pyogenes, and considering the per -
formance of CRISPRi system is largely dependent on 
guide RNA, we designed several candidate guide RNAs 
and screened the best. The qRT-PCR results showed 
that all four lactate-producing enzyme genes were 
transcriptionally repressed (Figs.  3e, 6). In micro-aer
-
obic conditions, the strain Kp(ptac-puuC + placiD) 
coexpressing PuuC and ldhA-targeting dCas9-sgRNA 
complex produced similar level of lactic acid with the 
strain Kp(ptac-puuC + placiMALD) coexpressing puuC 
and dCas9-sgRNA targeting four lactate-producing 
enzyme genes (Figs.  4c, 5b, c), indicating that ldhA is the 
predominant gene for lactic acid synthesis. Importantly,

in fed-batch cultivation, although all CRISPRi strains 
produced similar levels of lactic acid at 24–30 h (Fig.  4c), 
however the strains Kp(ptac-puuC + placiD) and 
Kp(ptac-puuC + placiMALD) generated low levels of 
lactic acid during entire fermentation process. Clearly, 
this offers flexibility for fermentation, because lactic acid 
maintains minimal throughout (Fig.  5b, c). It should be 
pointed out that leaky expression of dCas9 occurred. 
This could be partially ascribed to unknown aTc analogs 
in yeast extract or possible influences of TetR/tetO on 
aTc. This engineered CRISPRi system needs amelioration 
prior to real-world application.
Our previous study reported the high titer of 3-HP 
(83.8  g/L) in K. pneumoniae (2), which is higher than 
CRISPRi strains. The low 3-HP production in CRISPRi 
strains could be partially attributed to the expression of 
dCas9 which imposed a heavy burden on cells. Despite 
low 3-HP production, lactic acid was attenuated by the 
engineered CRISPRi system, which simplified down
-
stream separation. The remaining lactic acid in bioreac -
tor is limited, and can be converted to other metabolites 
by expressing an enzyme. Alternatively, lactic acid can be 
separated using preparative chromatography. Clearly, this 
is uneconomical for large-scale fermentation. If 3-HP is

converted to acrylic acid simply by high temperature, the 
remaining lactic acid may not affect this process. In fact, 
separation of 3-HP from lactic acid is extremely challeng
-
ing because they are isomers. So far, nearly no techniques 
can efficiently separate 3-HP from lactic acid. Lactic acid 
is mainly generated from pyruvate and its synthesis path
-
ways are conserved in nearly all organisms (Additional 
file  1: Fig. S1). Conventional approaches to block lactic 
acid formation rely mainly on the deletion of enzyme 
genes or optimization of fermentation conditions [2, 7]. 
However, these approaches neglect the complexity of lac
-
tic acid pathways and their contribution to the produc -
tion of desired metabolites such as 3-HP and 1,3-PDO 
[9]. From the viewpoint of evolution, the complexity of 
lactic acid pathways enable bacteria to buffer external 
stimuli and adapt harsh environment. Deduced from 
Additional file 1: Fig. S1, deletion of one or two lactic acid 
pathways might not be lethal to K. pneumoniae owing to 
tailored compensation mechanism of lactic acid synthe
-
sis. That is, repression rather than deletion of lactic acid-
synthesizing enzyme genes is appropriate for metabolic 
engineering purposes. As such, CRISPRi was exploited to 
decipher and tune lactic acid metabolism.
In this study, the ldhA gene was shown to be pivotal 
for lactic acid accumulation when glycerol was the sole 
carbon source and micro-aerobic conditions were main
-
tained. As shown in Figs.  4c, 5b, inhibiting ldhA gene 
alone almost completely blocked lactic acid synthesis. 
This may be explained by the following reasons: (i) 3-HP 
production relies on PuuC overexpression which con
-
sumes  NAD+ and ATP [2]. Since lactic acid biosynthe -
sis is accompanied by the generation of  NAD+ and ATP , 
lactic acid was thus synthesized. (ii) Although l-lactate 
dehydrogenase (pmb) and lactaldehyde dehydrogenase 
(aldA) catalyze the formation of l-lactic acid (Fig.  1, 
Additional file  1: Fig. S1), however, the corresponding 
CRISPRi strains produced more lactic acid compared 
with the CRISPRi strain targeting d-lactate-producing 
enzyme gene (Fig.  4c). Presumably, d-lactate dehydro
-
genase contributed largely to lactic acid level. (iii) It 
has been reported that lactaldehyde can be synthesized 
through fucose and rhamnose metabolisms [26] (Addi
-
tional file  1: Fig. S1) and lactaldehyde may serve as an 
intermediate to alleviate the cytotoxicity of methylgly -
oxal. However, CRISPRi-based inactivation of lactalde -
hyde dehydrogenase (aldA) and methylglyoxal synthase 
(mgsA) failed to effectively block lactic acid production 
(Fig. 4c), indicating that lactic acid biosynthesis through 
methylglyoxal and lactaldehyde pathways may be mini
-
mal in current conditions, and methylglyoxal detoxifi -
cation has little impacts on lactate production and cell 
growth. Another finding of this study is carbon flux 
compensation between lactate-producing pathways, as 
repressing one pathway elicited other pathways (Fig. 6).
CRISPRi can simultaneously repress multiple genes 
due to recruitment of guide RNAs ([18, 25, 27], Fig.  4c). 
For enzymes in central pathways, deleting their synthe
-
sis genes may impede cell growth or even elicit cell death 
[5]. CRISPRi is an ideal tool to coordinate cell growth 
and bioproduction of desired metabolites. Furthermore, 
unlike RNA interference which represses gene expression 
at posttranscriptional level, CRISPRi suppresses gene 
expression at transcriptional level and thus consumes less 
cellular resources. More importantly, CRISPRi can be 
easily applied in microbes lacking NHEJ pathway or for 
which no efficient homologous recombination approach 
is available. Hence, we believe that the CRISRPi system 
developed in this study will facilitate functional charac
-
terization of key genes and metabolic engineering of K. 
pneumoniae.
Methods
Strains, medium and chemicals
Strains of K. pneumoniae DSM 2026 and E. coli Top10 
were purchased from DSMZ GmbH, Germany. Strain K. 
pneumoniae DSM 2026 was used as the host for devel
-
opment of CRISPRi system. E. coli Top10 was used 
for gene cloning (Additional file  2: Fig. S2, Additional 
file 3: Table S1). In vector construction experiments, all 
strains were grown in LB medium containing the follow -
ing components per liter: 5  g yeast extract, 10  g NaCl, 
10 g peptone, and 50 mg kanamycin or 34 mg chloram
-
phenicol. In CRISPRi experiments, strains were grown 
in fermentation medium containing the following com
-
ponents per liter:  K2HPO4·3H2O, 3.4  g;  KH2PO4, 1.3  g; 
 (NH4)2SO4, 4 g;  MgSO4·7H2O, 0.5 g;  CaCO3, 0.1 g; yeast 
extract, 3 g; glycerol, 40 g; and 1.25 mL of trace element 
solution. The trace element solution contained the fol -
lowing components per liter:  FeSO4, 32  g;  ZnCl2·6H2O, 
2.72 g;  MnCl2·4H2O, 0.68 g;  CoCl2·6H2O, 1.88 g;  H3BO3, 
0.24 g;  Na2MoO4, 0.02 g;  CuCl2·2H2O, 1.88 g and 40 mL 
concentrated HCl. Restriction enzymes, taq DNA poly -
merase and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from TaKaRa 
(Dalian, China). Primer synthesis and DNA sequencing 
were performed by Biomed Co., Ltd. Other chemicals for 
fluorescence assay, gel electrophoresis, and HPLC analy
-
sis were products of Sigma.
Construction of recombinants
To develop CRISPRi system in K. pneunomiae, enhanced 
green fluorescent protein (EGFP) was used as a reporter. 
Vector ptac-egfp was constructed by insertion of tac-egfp  
expression cassette into pET-28a between BglII and XhoI. 
The CRISPRi vectors targeting egfp  gene or lactate-pro
-
ducing enzyme genes were constructed by replacement 
Page 10 of 12Wang et al. Microb Cell Fact  (2018) 17:56 
of the sgRNA sequence in vector plv-dCas9-sgRNA 
[28] (Additional file  2: Fig. S2, Additional file  3: Table 
S1). Briefly, two complementary single-stranded target 
sequences were chemically synthesized and annealed 
to form a 23 bp double-stranded DNA owning cohesive 
ends matching the BspQI-digested vector. Subsequent 
ligation resulted in desired CRISPRi vectors. Vector 
pdCas9 was achieved by deleting the sgRNA sequence in 
vector plv-dCas9-sgRNA with Xma I/NgoMIV, followed 
by ligation. To ensure efficient inhibition, two candidate 
guide RNAs targeting the different regions of EGFP pro
-
moter were synthesized and the resultant vectors were 
designated  ptaciT
1 and  ptaciT2 (Additional file  3: Table 
S1). For each lactate-producing enzyme gene, two or 
three CRISPRi vectors were constructed and named after 
respective gene (Additional file 4: Table S2). For example, 
‘placiM’ indicates the CRISPRi vector targeting methyl
-
glyoxal synthase gene mgsA ; ‘placiD’ refers to CRISPRi 
vector targeting d-lactate dehydrogenase gene ldhA; 
‘placiL’ indicates CRISPR vector targeting l-lactate dehy
-
drogenase (EC:1.1.1.27) gene pmb; ‘placiA’ represents the 
CRISPR vector targeting lactaldehyde dehydrogenase 
alhA; while ‘placiMALD’ indicates CRISPRi vector simul
-
taneously targeting above four genes (Additional file  3: 
Table S1).
Electro‑transformation and screening
The Eppendorf tube containing competent K. pneuno-
miae cells was embedded in ice for 30 min and then cen -
trifuged to harvest cells. The cells were extensively rinsed 
with cold  ddH
2O to remove ions and subsequently mixed 
with vectors. The mixture was added into a MicroPulser 
Cuvette for electroporation (0.2  cm, 2.5  kV, time dura
-
tion > 0.5 ms) based on manufacturer’s instructions. After 
cultivation in LB medium at 37 °C for 1 h, the cells were 
plated on LB-agar medium containing chlorampheni
-
col (34  µg/mL), kanamycin (50  µg/mL) or both of them 
depending on experimental requirements (Additional 
file 4: Table S2).
Fluorescence assay of CRISPRi strains targeting 
lactate‑producing enzyme genes
To establish CRISPRi system in K. pneunomiae, a panel 
of recombinant K. pneunomiae strains were constructed 
with EGFP as a reporter. Briefly, vectors ptac-egfp , 
 placiT1,  placiT2 (CRISPRi vectors targeting different 
region of the promoter sequence of EGFP) (Fig.  2), and 
the control vector plv-dCas9-sgRNA with non-targeting 
sgRNA, were individually transformed into component 
K. pneunomiae cells, resulting in recombinant strains K. 
pneunomiae(ptac-egfp), K. pneunomiae(ptac-placiT
1), 
K. pneunomiae(ptac-placiT2) and K. pneunomiae(plv-
dCas9-sgRNA), respectively. These recombinant strains 
were grown in LB medium for 15–20 h, and then trans -
ferred to 250  m: flasks containing 100  mL fermentation 
medium, 85 µg/mL chloramphenicol and 50 µg/mL kana
-
mycin. The strains were cultivated in a rotary shaker at 
200 rpm and 37 °C. After 3 h cultivation, IPTG and aTc, 
at final concentrations of 0.5 mM and 2 µM, respectively, 
were added into fermentation broth, and the cultivation 
conditions were adjusted to 30 °C and 150 rpm to induce 
dCas9 expression. At 18  h, fermentation broth was 
diluted tenfold to examine  OD
600 using a visible spectro -
photometer (APL instrument, Shanghai). The fermenta -
tion broth was directly used for fluorescence assay by a 
fluorescence spectrophotometer (HITACHI).
Real‑time PCR analysis of CRISPRi strains targeting 
lactate‑producing enzyme genes
Klebsiella pneumoniae cells were harvested by centrifu -
gation at 12,000  rpm and 4  °C and immediately chilled 
with liquid nitrogen to avoid RNA degradation. The 
cells were used for extracting total RNA. For CRISPRi 
strains Kp(ptac-puuC + placiL), Kp(ptac-puuC + placiD), 
Kp(ptac-puuC + placiA), Kp(ptac-puuC + placiM) and 
Kp(ptac-puuC + placiMALD), total RNA was extracted 
using the RNA prep pure Cell/Bacteria Kit (Tiangen, 
Beijing, China). The cDNA was synthesized using HiFi-
MMLV cDNA Synthesis Kit (CWbio Co. Ltd). The 
chemically synthesized cDNA was mixed and subjected 
to gradient dilution and served as template to deter
-
mine the specificity and efficiency of the primers. qRT-
PCR was carried out using UltraSYBR mixture (with 
ROX) (CWbio. Co. Ltd). The cDNA from each sample 
was diluted to determine the linear range for qRT-PCR 
(Fig. 3). 16S rRNA was recruited as the internal standard 
in qRT-PCR analysis. The statistics was analyzed using 
 2
−∆∆Ct strategy.
Shake‑flask cultivation of CRISPRi strains targeting 
lactate‑producing enzyme genes
The CRISPRi vectors targeting one or four lactate-
producing enzyme genes were transformed into K. 
pneumoniae(ptac-puuC), generating recombinant 
strains Kp(ptac-puuC + placiM), Kp(ptac-puuC + pla
-
ciA), Kp(ptac-puuC + placiL), Kp(ptac-puuC + placiD) 
and Kp(ptac-puuC + placiMALD). The strain harbor -
ing vector plv-dCas9 was used as a control (Additional 
file  3: Table S1). All above recombinant K. pneumoniae 
strains were grown in LB medium for 10  h and subse
-
quently transferred to shake flasks containing fermenta -
tion medium, 85 µg/mL chloramphenicol and 50 µg/mL 
kanamycin. These strains were cultivated at 37  °C and 
150 rpm. After 3 h cultivation, IPTG and aTc at final con
-
centrations of 0.5 mM and 2 µM, respectively, were added 
to induce dCas9 expression. The fermentation broth was 
Page 11 of 12

sampled every 3 h to examine cell growth, glycerol con -
sumption and metabolites formation.
Bioreactor cultivation of CRISPRi strains targeting 
lactate‑producing enzyme genes
Strains Kp(ptac-puuC + placiD) and Kp(ptac-
puuC + placiMALD) were grown in shake-flasks con -
taining LB medium at 37  °C and shaken at 150  rpm. 
After 24  h cultivation, strains were transferred to 5  L 
bioreactor (Baoxing, China) containing antibiotics, IPTG 
and fermentation medium aforementioned. Fermenta
-
tion conditions were similar to previously reported [2]. 
Briefly, agitation speed was 400 rpm, air was supplied at 
1.5 vvm, pH was maintained at 7.0 by titration with 5 M 
NaOH. The initial glycerol concentration was 40 g/L. Dis
-
solved oxygen was monitored with electrode. Fermenta -
tion broth was sampled every 3  h to examine biomass, 
residual glycerol and metabolites. Glycerol was supple
-
mented when its concentration dropped below 10 g/L.
Analytical methods
Cell concentrations were measured by using micro -
plate reader (Multiskan FC, Thermo) at 600  nm with 
200 µL fermentation broth added in a cuvette. To meas
-
ure metabolites, fermentation broth was centrifuged 
at 12,000 rpm for 10 min to remove bacteria. The 3-HP , 
lactic acid and acetic acid in supernatant were analyzed 
by HPLC (Shimazu, Tokyo, Japan) system equipped with 
a  C
18 column and a SPD-20A UV detector at 210  nm. 
The column was maintained at 25 °C. The mobile phase 
was 0.05% phosphoric acid at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min. 
1,3-PDO and 2,3-BDO were analyzed by GC (Persee). 
Briefly, the sample were evaporated at 80 °C for 40 min 
to remove water, and then dissolved in ethanol for GC 
analysis. Analytical pure of 1,3-PDO and 2,3-BDO were 
used as standard for quantification.
