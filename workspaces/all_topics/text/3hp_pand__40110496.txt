Introduction: Reducing endogenous gene expression is key in microbial
metabolic engineering. Traditional methods for gene knockout or suppression
can be slow and complex. RNA interference (RNAi) provides a faster way to
regulate gene expression using plasmids with hairpin RNA. This study examines
single- and double-gene suppression in P. pastoris, a common system for
expressing heterologous proteins. We also use reporter strains displaying
EGFP on the cell surface to identify factors affecting protein secretion.
Methods: We established an RNAi system inP. pastorisby introducing plasmids
containing hairpin RNA targeting speciﬁc genes. Reporter strains expressingEGFP
on the cell surface were used to monitor the impact of gene suppression on
protein secretion. Genes such asYAP1, YPS1, PRB1, andPEP4 were targeted for
RNAi. Additionally, RNAi was applied to inhibit fatty acid synthesis to improve the
conversion of malonyl-CoA to 3-hydroxypropionate (3-HP).
Results: Suppressing YAP1 and YPS1 reduced EGFP display by 83% and 48.8%,
respectively. In contrast, suppressingPRB1 and PEP4 increased EGFP display by
33.8% and 26.5%, respectively. Theseﬁndings show that regulating endogenous
genes can signiﬁcantly impact protein secretion inP. pastoris. Furthermore, RNAi
inhibition of fatty acid synthesis improved 3-HP production.
Discussion: This study demonstrates the successful establishment of an RNAi
system in P. pastoris , enabling ef ﬁcient gene suppression for metabolic
engineering. RNAi offers a faster and more efﬁcient method for regulating
gene expression, improving heterologous protein secretion and 3-HP
production. This system is a valuable tool for optimizing P. pastoris as a
microbial cell factory, with strong potential for industrial applications.

1 Introduction
Pichia pastorisis a methylotrophic yeast widely used for the production of recombinant
proteins due to its robust promoters, post-translational modiﬁcation capabilities, ease of
culture, and potential for high-density fermentation (Ahmad et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2022;
Zha et al., 2023). Recently, P. pastoris has become a leading industrial platform for
producing recombinant proteins, especially in the biopharmaceutical and industrial
enzyme sectors. As a “generally regarded as safe” (GRAS) microorganism, P. pastoris
has proven to be a valuable tool in biotechnology. According to data from the RCT platform

(www.pichia.com), over 5000 distinct proteins have been
successfully expressed in this yeast (Schwarzhans et al., 2017).
Typical strategies to enhance exogenous protein expression inP.
pastoris include promoter engineering (Nong et al., 2020; Lai et al.,
2024; Zhou et al., 2023), signal peptide modiﬁcation (Li et al., 2015),
increasing copy number (Liu et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2021), deletion
of proteases (Ahmad et al., 2019), and the introduction of chaperone
factors (Zheng et al., 2019; Raschmanová et al., 2021). However,
direct gene knockout in the genome can lead to the loss of speciﬁc
functions within P. pastoris ’ metabolic pathways, potentially
disrupting its overall metabolic network. In contrast, leveraging
synthetic biology tools to modulate gene expression may offer a
more ef ﬁcient approach than traditional knockout or
overexpression methods.
Gene expression regulation is fundamental to numerous cellular
processes (de Nadal et al., 2011 ; Nielsen and Keasling, 2016 ).
Currently, the primary tools for gene regulation in
microorganisms are clustered regularly interspaced short
palindromic repeats (CRISPR) systems. However, using CRISPR
for gene activation or suppression often requires protein inactivation
within the CRISPR system, the addition of activation or inhibitory
domains, and careful selection of suitable sgRNA target sites. As a
result, the CRISPR system is relatively complex and time-
consuming. Furthermore, the application of CRISPR is also
inﬂuenced by factors such as host cell acceptance, foreign protein
expression efﬁciency, and target site selection accuracy, which makes
the optimization process more cumbersome. In gene activation,
additional transcriptional activators need to be introduced, while in
gene suppression, inhibitory factors must be efﬁciently designed and
delivered to ensure speci ﬁc regulation. Therefore, despite its
powerful gene regulation capabilities, the CRISPR system has
high operational complexity and time costs (Casas-Mollano et al.,
2020; Chen et al., 2020). In comparison, RNA interference (RNAi)
targets RNA directly, inﬂuencing protein translation and offering a
simpler method for gene regulation. RNAi is a gene silencing
pathway activated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)
(Drinnenberg et al., 2009 ), which is processed by the
ribonuclease III (RNaseIII) enzyme Dicer into small interfering
RNAs (siRNAs). Dicer is an enzyme responsible for cleaving
double-stranded RNA into small siRNA fragments. These siRNAs
then guide the Argonaute protein, which is involved in RNA
cleavage, to target and cleave the transcripts, effectively silencing
gene expression (Wang et al., 2019). The RNAi system, with its
essential components— Dicer, Argonaute, and siRNAs — offers a
more straightforward and ﬂexible approach to gene silencing
through simple plasmid transformation steps. This reduces time
and effort, facilitating the rapid development of gene inhibition
strategies across various strains (Crook et al., 2014).
This report details theﬁrst establishment of an RNAi system in
P. pastoris. The hypothesis that such a system could be created was
based on the observation that introducing the Argonaute protein
and siRNA into P. pastoris could achieve RNAi-like effects. This
suggested the potential presence of genes encoding Dicer-like
proteins in the P. pastoris genome. The study successfully
demonstrated single-gene (enhanced green ﬂuorescent protein
(EGFP)) and double-gene ( EGFP/Histidine ( His)) inhibition
through the RNAi system by introducing hairpin RNAs.
Genetically modiﬁed P. pastoris strains were used to modulate
EGFP surface display, revealing that inhibiting the expression of
endogenous genes Yeast AP-1-like transcription factor (YAP1) and
Yeast Protease A (YPS1) reduced EGFP display levels by 83% and
48.8%, respectively. Conversely, inhibiting the expression of
endogenous genes Proteinase B (PRB1) and Proteinase A (PEP4)
resulted in increases inEGFP display levels by 33.8% and 26.5%,
respectively. Furthermore, the RNAi system was applied to enhance
the synthesis of the natural product 3-HP inP. pastoris.
In conclusion, the establishment of an RNAi system in P.
pastoris and its successful application in enhancing both
exogenous protein secretion and natural product synthesis
demonstrate that RNAi is a powerful tool for gene expression
regulation. This advancement signi ﬁcantly contributes to the
development of P. pastoris cell factories, providing a promising
platform for future biotechnological applications.
2 Materials and methods
2.1 Strains and culture conditions
The Escherichia coli Top10 strain was used for DNA
manipulation. Cells were cultured in low-salt LB medium (1%
tryptone, 0.5% NaCl, and 0.5% yeast extract) and selected with
25 μg/mL zeocin (Invitrogen) to conﬁrm successful transformation
of the bacterial plasmid.P. pastoris GS115 cells were used as host
cells for protein expression. Transformants of P. pastoris were
selected on YPDZ (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% glucose, 2%
agar, and 25 μg/mL zeocin) plates after incubation for 2–3 days
at 30
°C.
For shakeﬂask cultivation, the inoculum was cultured in 10 mL
BMGY medium (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 1.34% YNB, 1%
glycerol, 10% 1 mol/L pH 6.0 phosphate buffer) for 24 h to an initial
OD600 of 0.5. The inoculum was then transferred to 25 mL BMMY
(1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 1.34% YNB, 1% methanol, 10%
1 mol/L pH 6.0 phosphate buffer), 10 mL semi-MM (0.67% YNB, 1%
methanol), or 10 mL semi-MD (0.67% YNB, 1% glucose) culture
medium for 120 h. Add 1% methanol or glucose every 24 h during
cultivation to supplement the carbon source. (Control the initial
OD600 of semi-MM and semi-MD media at 0.02. All cultures were
conducted in BMMY medium unless otherwise speciﬁed.)
2.2 Construction method of hairpin RNA and
dsRNA plasmids
Due to the repetitive sequences in both the hairpin RNA and
dsRNA plasmids, all plasmid constructions required ligation using
the DNA Ligase Kit (Thermo Scienti ﬁc). For example, in the
construction of pPICZA-EGFP-His (300 bp)-rad9-antiEGFP-His
(300 bp), the EGFP-His (300 bp)-rad9 fragment was initially
generated via overlap extension PCR, during which EcoRI and
NotI restriction sites were introduced for the ampliﬁcation of the
EGFP (300 bp) andHis (300 bp) sequences, respectively. TheEGFP-
His (300 bp)-rad9 fragment and the previously prepared plasmid
pPICZA were then digested with EcoRI and NotI, followed by
ligation with DNA ligase to construct the plasmid pPICZA-
EGFP-His (300 bp)-rad9.
Frontiers inBioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org02
Ruan et al. 10.3389/fbioe.2025.1548187
Next, the anti-EGFP-His (300 bp) DNA fragment was ampliﬁed,
incorporating AgeI and NotI restriction sites for the ampliﬁcation of
the anti- EGFP (300 bp) and anti- His (300 bp) sequences,
respectively. The anti- EGFP-His (300 bp) fragment was then
digested with AgeI and NotI, as was the pPICZA- EGFP-His
(300 bp)-rad9 plasmid. The two digested products were ligated
using DNA ligase to generate the hairpin plasmid pPICZA-EGFP-
His (300 bp)-rad9-antiEGFP-His (300 bp).
For the construction of the dsRNA plasmid, the process is
exempli ﬁed through the construc tion of pPICZA-AOX1TT-
PAOX1- YAP1-PAOX1-AOX1TT- His4.U s i n go v e r l a p
extension PCR, the AOX1TT-PAOX1- YAP1 fragment was
ampliﬁed, incorporating EcoRI and BamHI restriction sites.
The plasmid pPICZA-AOX1-AOX1TT- His4 and the AOX1TT-
PAOX1- YAP1 fragment were then di gested with EcoRI and
BamHI, followed by ligation with DNA ligase to construct the
dsRNA plasmid pPICZA-AOX1TT-PAOX1- YAP1-PAOX1-
AOX1TT- His4. (The schematic diagrams of the construction
process of the hairpin RNA plasmid and dsRNA plasmid can
be found in Supplementary Figures 3, 4.)
2.3 Flow cytometry cell sorting
The dsRNA plasmid was electroporated into the GK3EA strain,
and the cells were incubated on YPDZ plates at 30°C for 3 days. The
resulting transformants were thoroughly mixed and co-cultured in
BMGY medium for 36 h. The cells were then harvested, washed
twice with 1.5 mL of PBS buffer, and resuspended in the same buffer.
After dilution to an OD600 of approximately 0.5, theﬂuorescence
intensity of the mixed library was analyzed using an S3eTMﬂow
cytometer (Bio-Rad Laboratory, Inc.) with blue excitation light at
488 nm. Theﬂow cytometry results were processed and analyzed
using FlowJo software (TreeStar, Ashland, OR, United States).
Approximately 100,000 cells were analyzed, and the top 1% of
cells were sorted. The sorted cells were then plated onto YPDZ
plates, incubated for 72 h, and 3–5 transformants were randomly
selected for cultivation.
2.4 Reconstruction of the RNAi mechanism
in P. pastoris
The Ago protein fromSaccharomyces castelli was synthesized
and codon-optimized forP. pastorisexpression under the control of
the constitutive PGAP promoter. The shRNA and dsRNA plasmids
were constructed following the previously described procedure.
Although the Dicer protein is encoded in theP. pastoris genome,
the gene responsible for its expression remains unidenti ﬁed,
constituting the RNAi system in P. pastoris . To assess the
functionality of the RNAi mechanism, we used a reporter system
utilizing green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP). After cultivation and
culturing the strains, 200 µL of the yeast culture was centrifuged
to remove the supernatant, and the cells were resuspended in 1 mL
of PBS (pH 7.4) buffer. The suspension was centrifuged at 6000 rpm
for 5 min and repeated three times. Finally, 1 mL of PBS buffer was
added to resuspend the cells, and 200 µL of the suspension was used
to measure the greenﬂuorescence intensity in the yeast strains using
a spectrophotometer (Biotek/Synergy H1/H1M) with 488 nm
excitation and 520 nm emission.
2.5 qPCR (Quantitative PCR) was used to
measure changes in gene
transcription levels
Total RNA fromP. pastoriswas extracted using the hot phenol
method. The extracted RNA samples were treated to remove
genomic DNA (gDNA) and then reverse-transcribed using the
PrimeScript
™ RT Reagent Kit with gDNA Eraser. The
concentration of the resulting cDNA was measured and diluted
to 70 ng/μL. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was
then performed using the SYBR
® Premix Ex Taq™ II (Tli RNaseH
Plus) kit. TheGAPDH gene in P. pastoris was used as a reference
gene to measure the transcription levels of theEGFP, HIS, PRB1,
PEP4, YAP1, YPS1, andFAS1 genes. The data were analyzed using
the 2^-△△Ct method to quantify the relative changes in gene
expression.
2.6 Detection of 3-hydroxypropionic acid
1.5 mL of the cultured broth is taken, centrifuged at 6000 rpm
for 10 min, and the supernatant is collected. The supernatant is
ﬁltered through a 0.22μm ﬁlter membrane to remove any remaining
yeast. The concentration of 3-HP in the cultured liquid is measured
using a Waters 1525 HPLC system. The treated sample is eluted
through a 300 mm × 7.8 mm BioRad HPX-87H column, with a
mobile phase of 0.5 mmol/L H
2SO4,a ﬂow rate of 0.4 mL/min, and
an elution time of 25 min. UV detection is performed at 210 nm, and
the column temperature is maintained at 60
°C.
2.7 TheEGFP protein is displayed on the
surface ofP. pastoris
The N-terminus of theEGFP gene is fused with theα-factor
signal peptide, which guides the protein to the extracellular space.
The C-terminus is fused with the GCW61 anchoring protein
sequence, which anchors the EGFP protein to the cell wall. The
EGFP expression cassette was constructed into a three-copyEGFP
plasmid, pHKA- EGFP-Gcw61-3copy, using BglII and BamHI
restriction enzymes. The plasmid pHKA-EGFP-Gcw61-3copy was
linearized with the restriction enzyme Eam1105I and electroporated
into GS115. Detailed DNA sequences are provided in the
supplementary materials.
3 Results and discussion
3.1 The dicer protein expressed inP. pastoris
RNA interference (RNAi) is a gene silencing mechanism
activated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). The RNAi pathway
in budding yeast involves three essential components: dsRNA, the
speciﬁc endoribonuclease Dicer, and the binding protein Ago. The
Frontiers inBioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org03
Ruan et al. 10.3389/fbioe.2025.1548187
previous study has reported the loss of RNAi functionality in most
budding yeast species, although some species retain the Ago protein
(Drinnenberg et al., 2009). InSaccharomyces cerevisiae, neither the
Dicer protein, the Ago protein, nor double-stranded RNA has been
detected. Through genome alignment, we identiﬁed an endogenous
protein inP. pastoristhat may function similarly to the Dicer protein
in Saccharomyces castellii, named RNAase III (PAS_chr4_0127).
Additionally, by introducing only the Ago protein intoP. pastoris,
we observed that the RNAi system can function normally inP.
pastoris (Figure 1A). This suggests the presence of a Dicer gene inP.
pastoris, although the speciﬁc gene encoding the Dicer protein has
not yet been identiﬁed in this study.
3.2 RNAi-mediated silencing of single genes
in P. pastoris
Hairpin RNAs, double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), and full-
length antisense RNAs have been shown to serve as substrates for
Dicer in generating small inter fering RNAs (siRNAs). These
siRNA duplexes mediate mRNA degradation in collaboration
with Argonaute proteins, effect ively suppressing the expression
of target genes (Chen et al., 2020). Among these, hairpin RNA is
particularly ef ﬁcient due to its higher recognition af ﬁnity by
Dicer and greater RNA interference (RNAi) activation capability,
making it the preferred precurso r for single-gene suppression
(Liu et al., 2002).
To evaluate the RNAi system inP. pastoris, A plasmid, pPICZA-
EGFP-HIS4300-rad9-antiEGFP-HIS4300, was constructed
containing fragments of theEGFP and HIS genes, each featuring
a 300 bp forward sequence followed by a 300 bp inverted repeat
sequence. A linker sequence was added between the inverted repeat
sequences at both ends to facilitate the folding back of the repeat
sequences after transcription and form the shRNA structure.
Experimental results revealed that the histidine-de ﬁcient
GS115 strain of P. pastoris exhibited partial growth inhibition in
the GKEA and GKEA-EH300 strains, with the highest OD600 value
reaching approximately 20 (Figure 1B). Growth was restored upon

complementation of the HIS gene, conﬁrming the dependency
on histidine.
In ﬂuorescence assays, the GKEA strain (positive control) showed a
signiﬁcantly higher RFU/OD600 of 2198.12. In contrast, the GKEA-
EH300 strain exhibited a dramatic reduction in relativeﬂuorescence
intensity, with an RFU/OD600 of 343. Similarly, after histidine
complementation, the GKEA-9K positive control strain maintained a
high RFU/OD600 value of 2242, whereas the GKEA-EH300-9K strain
demonstrated a substantially reduced RFU/OD600 value of 215,
consistent with prior observations (Figure 1A).
To conﬁrm that the reducedﬂuorescence intensity was attributable
to the RNAi mechanism, transcriptional analysis of theEGFP gene was
performed for the GKEA-EH300 and GKEA-EH300-9K strains. Results
indicated a clear reduction inEGFPtranscription levels (Figures 1C, D).
These ﬁndings collectively demonstrate that the RNAi system is
functional inP. pastoris, effectively mediating gene silencing.
3.3 RNAi-based negative modulation of dual
genes expression inP. pastoris
Figure 1B demonstrates that despite the repression of theHIS
gene, the growth of the GKEA-EH300-9K strain was not
signiﬁcantly impaired, likely due to the abundant carbon sources
in BMMY medium, which supported normal growth. To further
investigate the effect of simultaneous repression of both gene, the
GKEA-EH300-9K strain was cultured under semi-MM and semi-
MD culture conditions. After 96 h of fermentation, growth
conditions and relativeﬂuorescence intensities were evaluated.
The results showed that under semi-MM conditions, the growth of
the GKEA-EH300-9K strain was signiﬁcantly inhibited compared to the
GKEA-9K strain (Figure 2A). However, under semi-MD medium, the
growth of GKEA-9K and GKEA-EH300-9K strains was similar
(Figure 2D). These observations suggest that the RNAi system
effectively suppressed the expression of theHIS gene, leading to
growth limitation of the GKEA-EH300-9K strain in semi-MM medium.
Further evaluation of the relativeﬂuorescence intensity of all strains
under semi-MM and semi-MD conditions at 72 h of cultivation was
conducted. In the 72-hour cultivation, under semi-MM conditions, the
relativeﬂuorescence intensity of the GKEA-EH300-9K strain decreased
by 57% compared to the GKEA-9K strain (Figure 2B). In contrast, under
semi-MD conditions, there was no signiﬁcant difference in relative
ﬂuorescence intensity among the strains (Figure 2E). This result is
attributed to the inhibitory effect of the methanol-induced
AOX1 promoter under glucose-rich conditions, which suppressed the
expression of the EH300 plasmid, thuseliminating the inhibitory effect
under semi-MD conditions. Additionally, transcriptional analysis
provided further insights. Under semi-MM medium, the
transcription levels ofEGFP and HIS g e n e si nt h eG K E A - E H 3 0 0 - 9 K
strain decreased by approximately 20%. In contrast, under semi-MD
conditions, there were no signiﬁcant changes in the transcription levels
of the GKEA-EH300-9K strain (Figures 2C, F).

Ruan et al. 10.3389/fbioe.2025.1548187
These ﬁndings collectively con ﬁrm that under semi-MM
conditions, the RNAi system successfully interfered with the
expression of both target genes in P. pastoris, as evidenced by
growth inhibition and reducedﬂuorescence intensity.
3.4 Reducing the production ofEGFP in P.
pastoris by RNAi
By leveraging RNAi to disrupt the expression of key genes in the
exogenous protein expression pathway ofP. pastoris, it is possible to
regulate exogenous protein expression levels. The transcription
factor YAP1 and the protease YPS1 play critical roles in this
pathway. YAP1 expression mitigates cellular damage caused by
reactive oxygen species (ROS), thereby enhancing protein
expression (Delic et al., 2014). Conversely, studies have shown
that knocking out the YPS1 gene reduces the degradation of
exogenous proteins (Sazonova et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2013).
In this study,EGFP was used as a reporter protein, and double-
stranded RNA (dsRNA) targeting theYAP1 and YPS1 genes was
introduced into the genome of the GK3EA yeast strain to establish
an RNAi system.
The results revealed varying degrees of reduction in EGFP
expression after integratingYAP1 and YPS1 dsRNAs. After 72 h of
fermentation, the ability of yeast cells containing three copies of the
(EGFP)g e n et od i s p l a yEGFPw a sr e d u c e db y8 3 %i ns t r a i n sw i t hYAP1
dsRNA integration. (Figure 3A). Similarly, a 48.8% reduction in this
ability was observed in strains withYPS1dsRNA integration after 72 h of
fermentation (Figure 3B). Flow cytometric analysis of the GK3EA-YAP1
and GK3EA-YPS1 strains conﬁrmed that the mean ﬂuorescence
intensities were lower than those of the GK3EA strain when
100,000 cells were analyzed, indicating successful RNAi-mediated
suppression ofYAP1 and YPS1 expression. This suppression reduced
the ability to displayEGFPon the cell surface (Supplementary Figure 1).
To further conﬁrm that the reduction inﬂuorescence intensity
was due to RNAi action, transcription level assays were conducted
on the GK3EA-YAP1 and GK3EA-YPS1 strains. Compared to the
GK3EA strain, transcription levels of theYAP1 gene in GK3EA-
YAP1 and the YPS1 gene in GK3EA- YPS1 were signiﬁcantly
decreased (Figures 3C, D
).

Frontiers inBioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org06
Ruan et al. 10.3389/fbioe.2025.1548187
These ﬁndings demonstrate that the RNAi system can effectively
interfere with the expression of endogenous genes involved in the
exogenous protein expression pathway ofP. pastoris. This approach
shows promise forﬁne-tuning the expression of exogenous proteins
by modulating the associated endogenous genes.
3.5 Increasing the production ofEGFP in P.
pastoris by RNAi
The genes PRB1 and PEP4 encode vacuolar proteinase B and
vacuolar proteinase A (Moehle et al., 1987; Woolford et al., 1986;
Marsalek et al., 2019), respectively, both of which play signiﬁcant
roles in protein degradation. The previous study has reported that
deleting these genes can enhance exogenous protein expression
(Marsalek et al., 2019). Building on this insight, an RNAi system
was developed to increaseEGFP expression by integrating dsRNAs
targeting PRB1 and PEP4 into GK3EA yeast cells.
The results demonstrated notable increases inEGFP expression
in yeast strains following the integration of dsRNAs targetingPRB1
and PEP4. After 72 h of cultivation, yeast strains withPRB1 dsRNA
integration showed a 33.8% increase in the ability of yeast cells
containing three copies of the gene to displayEGFP (Figure 4A).
Similarly, strains withPEP4 dsRNA integration exhibited a 26.5%
increase in EGFP surface display (Figure 4C). The ﬂow cytometry
histograms of the GK3EA-PRB1 strain were consistent with the
cultivation results, further corroborating these ﬁndings
(Supplementary Figure 2).
Transcriptional analysis rev ealed a measurable decrease in
the transcription levels of the PRB1 gene in the GK3EA-PRB1
strain and thePEP4 gene in the GK3EA-PEP4 strain compared to
the GK3EA strain. These results con ﬁrm the successful
suppression of PRB1 and PEP4 expression by the RNAi system
(Figures 4B, D).
This study highlights the effectiveness of employing an RNAi
system to repress endogenous genes that in ﬂuence protein
degradation pathways. By targeting PRB1 and PEP4, this
approach successfully enhances exogenous protein expression,
providing a powerful strategy for optimizing global protein

3.6 Enhancing 3-hydroxypropionic acid
production inP. pastoris via RNAi
Building on the successful modulation ofEGFP expression inP.
pastoris, the RNAi system was further applied to regulate key
metabolic pathways for 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP)
production, demonstrating the versatility of the RNAi system in
both protein expression and metabolic engineering. By targeting
fatty acid synthesis, we aimed to enhance malonyl-CoA availability,
a crucial precursor for 3-HP biosynthesis, thus expanding the utility
of RNAi technology beyond exogenous protein production to
valuable natural product synthesis.
3-HP is a highly versatile platform chemical, extensively utilized
in the synthesis of acrylic acid, methyl methacrylate, propiolactone,
and malonic acid (Wu et al., 2023; Qin et al., 2024). Recognizing its
substantial industrial value, the U.S. Department of Energy has
identiﬁed 3-HP as one of the most promising platform chemicals
(Qin et al., 2024).
The use of P. pastoris as a microbial cell factory for 3-HP
production offers signi ﬁcant potential due to its favorable
attributes for industrial bioprocessing. In this study, the synthetic
pathway genes for 3-HP production were successfully integrated
into theP. pastorisGS115 strain, resulting in the development of a 3-
HP-producing strain (HP strain). However, achieving optimal yields
of 3-HP remains a formidable challenge, necessitating further
advancements in strain engineering and process optimization to
fully harness its industrial potential.
To enhance the conversion efﬁciency of malonyl-CoA to 3-
hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP), this study utilized RNAi technology
to suppress fatty acid synthesis, thereby increasing malonyl-CoA
availability. The HP strain was further engineered by introducing the
Ago plasmid and a bidirectional promoter plasmid containing an
FAS1 gene fragment, resulting in the development of the HP-FAS1
strain (Figure 5A).
By employing this RNAi strategy, the 3-HP yield in the HP-
FAS1 strain increased signiﬁcantly, rising from 281 mg/L to 322 mg/
L( Figure 5B). Furthermore, transcriptional analysis revealed a 20%
reduction in FAS1 expression in the HP-FAS1 strain (Figure 5C),
underscoring the effective implementation of RNAi technology to
enhance 3-HP biosynthesis in P. pastoris. This study not only
underscores the transformative impact of RNAi on improving 3-
HP production but also serves as a compelling example of employing
RNAi systems in P. pastoris to boost the biosynthesis of other
valuable natural products. Theseﬁndings provide critical insights
into the application of advanced genetic engineering techniques in
industrial microorganisms, paving the way for further innovations
in biomanufacturing.
In summary, RNAi technology enhances the synthesis efﬁciency
of target products (such as 3-HP) by inhibiting speciﬁc metabolic
pathways, reducing resource wastage during the production process,
and thus lowering production costs. Additionally, RNAi technology
does not rely on complex gene editing tools, making it simple to
operate and cost-effective, which is suitable for large-scale
production. By improving the efﬁciency of metabolic ﬂux, it can
signiﬁcantly increase product yield, thereby boosting the economic
beneﬁts of the production process. Furthermore, the high tunability
and ﬂexibility of RNAi technology enable its broad application
across different microbial production platforms, further
enhancing its scalability and adaptability in industrial production.
Therefore, RNAi technology provides an economically efﬁcient and
scalable solution for large-scaleP. pastoris production, with strong
market potential.
4 Conclusion
With the rapid advancement of synthetic biology tools and the
inherent adaptability ofP. pastoris, this yeast has quickly become
one of the most attractive hosts for heterologous protein production.
In microbial production processes, achieving optimal yields of
products or synthetic proteins often necessitates ﬁne-tuning the
expression of key enzymes within speciﬁc metabolic pathways. The
RNAi system, being a simple and efﬁcient tool, is particularly suited
for this task, offering an innovative solution for high-throughput
screening and other metabolic engineering applications, thus
facilitating the development of engineeredP. pastoris strains.
RNAi studies in yeast began with Saccharomyces cerevisiae
model strains. Early work by P. Bartel and colleagues introduced

Dicer and Argonaute proteins from Saccharomyces castellii into
brewing yeast to reconstruct the RNAi system. This was used to
silence endogenous retrotransposons, successfully integrating RNAi
tools into budding yeast research ( Drinnenberg et al., 2009 ).
Subsequently, S. Alper and colleagues outlined design principles
for constructing hairpin RNA expression cassettes in yeast,
leveraging RNA interference to enhance erythromycin production
(Crook et al., 2014). Building on these efforts, Petranovic and
colleagues utilized droplet microﬂuidics screening combined with
experimental validation to identify RNAi targets that enhance
recombinant protein production in S. cerevisiae (Wang et al.,
2019). Inspired by these advancements, we aimed to develop an
RNAi system forP. pastoristo streamline the design-build-test cycle
while reducing costs.
In this study, we successfully established an RNAi system inP.
pastoris capable of silencing single or double genes. Using this
system, we identiﬁed effective genetic targets and implemented
gene inhibition strategies to modulate the surface display levels of
exogenous EGFP, either enhancing or reducing its expression.
Additionally, to demonstrate the versatility of this system, we
applied it to suppress fatty acid synthesis, resulting in increased
malonyl-CoA availability and improved 3-HP production.
The expansion of RNAi systems represents a signi ﬁcant
milestone in the metabolic engineering of P. pastoris . This
technology provides an ef ﬁcient and convenient method for
regulating gene expression, particularly for genes requiring
precise modulation. By integrating RNAi with high-throughput
screening methods, further potential genetic targets inP. pastoris
can be uncovered, signiﬁcantly enhancing its practical applications
as a versatile cell factory. It is important to note that the application
of this method is not limited toP. pastorisbut can also be extended
to other microbial systems, further advancing the use of RNAi
technology in microbial metabolic engineering. Future research
directions could include applying RNAi systems to other types of
microorganisms to optimize their production capacity and further
improving RNAi technology for greater effectiveness and precision.
Although RNAi technology has demonstrated strong potential
in gene suppression, its potential limitations in application also need
to be addressed. First, gene copy number signiﬁcantly affects the
efﬁciency of RNAi suppression. In some cases, a higher gene copy
number may reduce the effectiveness of the RNAi system, especially
when excessive gene copies are expressed in the cell, which may
require more RNAi reagents to achieve effective suppression.
Additionally, RNAi technology may have “off-target effects ”
during the suppression of certain genes, meaning unrelated genes
or regulatory elements may be suppressed, leading to some side
effects. Furthermore, the persistence of RNAi suppression may also
be limited, particularly in long-term cultures or large-scale
production, where the effect of RNAi may gradually weaken.
Therefore, future research should thoroughly explore these
limitations and optimize the RNAi system to improve its
application effectiveness and scalability in different
microbial systems.
In summary, we developed a robust RNAi-based gene
expression regulation toolkit forP. pastoris, enabling both single-
and double-gene suppression. This toolkit was successfully used to
ﬁne-tune endogenous gene expression, optimizing the surface
display of EGFP and improving 3-HP synthesis. Our work
highlights the potential of RNAi as a powerful resource for
advancing the efﬁciency and versatility of P. pastoris as a cell
factory for industrial applications.
