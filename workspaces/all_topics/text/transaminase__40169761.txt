Dimethylguanidino valeric acid (DMGV) is a group of endogenous metabolites derived from arginine-
containing proteins and is associated with several metabolic disorders. Latest studies have identified 
the stereoisomers of DMGV: asymmetric dimethylguanidino valeric acid (ADGV) and symmetric 
dimethylguanidino valeric acid (SDGV), which are derived from asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) 
and symmetric dimethylarginine (SDMA), respectively. However, the lack of commercial standards 
has hampered research into the molecular mechanisms of DMGV and its potential clinical application 
as biomarkers. Reported chemical synthesis methods have low yields and require specialized chemical 
synthesis skills and apparatus. Therefore, we aimed to develop a practical and efficient method to 
synthesize DMGV stereoisomers and determine their precise concentration profile in healthy subjects. 
A novel biocatalytic method for synthesizing DMGV using alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase 2 
(AGXT2) was developed. A metabolite panel including eight DMGV-related metabolites was also 
established for human plasma samples using HPLC-MS/MS, and its performance was comprehensively 
evaluated, especially in terms of quantitative sensitivity, precision and accuracy. Compared with 
the reported chemical synthesis methods, the biocatalytic approach demonstrates superior yield, 
conversion rate, and product purity, while being easy to implement in biological laboratories. The 
established DMGV quantification method has been well validated and successfully applied to measure 
the contents of these metabolites, especially the concentration profile of ADGV in the plasma of 
healthy individuals. To sum up, this study provides an efficient and practical biocatalytic approach 
for DMGV synthesis and determines the levels of DMGV in healthy subjects. These findings will 
undoubtedly promote future mechanistic studies of DMGV and its future clinical applications.

Dimethylguanidino valeric acid (DMGV) has been reported to be a potentially important biomarker associated 
with several metabolic disorders, such as obesity 1, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)2, type 2 diabetes2 
and cardiovascular disease3. O’Sullivan et al. (2017) first discovered the importance of DMGV as a biochemical 
compound in metabolic diseases. In this work, DMGV levels were found to be an independent biomarker of 
CT-defined NAFLD in the Swedish cohort of the Framingham Heart Study, and the baseline levels of DMGV 
independently predicted future diabetes up to 12 years before disease onset in three distinct human cohorts 2. 
Furthermore, elevated DMGV levels in plasma were associated with the incidence of coronary heart disease 
and cardiovascular mortality in three different Swedish cohorts involving 5768 participants 4. A multicenter 
prospective cohort study of patients with suspected coronary artery disease also showed that DMGV was 
associated with the occurrence and severity of coronary artery disease 3. Given that dietary habits and physical 
activity are the primary means of preventing metabolic disorders, studies have also shown that DMGV levels 
in the blood were highly associated with lifestyles 5. Ottosson et al. (2019) revealed that individuals with higher 
plasma DMGV levels tended to consume more sweetened beverages while taking less vegetables4. It was further 
demonstrated that macronutrients affected DMGV-related metabolites in mouse models 5,6. In addition, high 
levels of DMGV were associated with poor metabolic responses to long-term cardiovascular prognosis 7, and 
both long-term exercise training intervention8 and acute exercise9 lowered plasma DMGV levels.
According to the latest published research 10, the endogenous metabolites DMGV has two stereoisomers, 
including asymmetric dimethylguanidino valeric acid (ADGV) and symmetric dimethylguanidino valeric 
acid (SDGV). ADGV and SDGV are produced from asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA) and symmetric 
dimethylarginine (SDMA), respectively, by alanine-glyoxylate aminotransferase 2 (AGXT2)11,12, a mitochondrial 
enzyme mainly expressed in kidney and liver. The published results on DMGV mainly refer to ADGV , and only 
one article reported SDGV and showed that SDGV is also one of the determinants in NAFLD progression13.
Although endogenous DMGV , including ADGV and SDGV , are closely related to metabolic diseases, the 
lack of commercial standards has hindered their mechanistic research and potential clinical application. Strictly 
speaking, both external and internal standards are required for absolute quantitation for setting up a multiple 
reaction monitoring (MRM) method using HPLC-QQQ-MS/MS which is the most sensitive and quantitative 
MS-based approach. However, to the best of our knowledge, only some published articles on DMGV were 
measured using in-house synthesized DMGV standards1,10,14, and some were based on untargeted metabolomics 
without DMGV standards7,15–18. According to the literature, ADGV was first synthesized and detected using a 
derivatization procedure19. Besides, two other articles mentioned the process of chemical synthesis1,10. However, 
after numerous attempts in our own lab, we found that the chemical synthesis of DMGV , especially the process for 
ADMA synthesis, is very time-consuming and has relatively high technical requirements in chemical operation. 
The synthesized DMGV from ADMA had low yield (5.6%) and low purity (78.4%). Therefore, the establishment 
of alternative synthetic approaches is necessary.
Biological catalysis is currently a leading method for small-molecule synthesis, with the advantages of being 
environmentally friendly, efficient, easy to operate, and having low production costs 20,21. Studies22,23 reported 
the biocatalytic production of keto-acid 6-guanidino-2-oxocaproic acid from homoarginine in HepG2 cells with 
the help of the AGXT2 enzyme overexpressed by an adenoviral vector, Therefore, it is promising to investigate 
the biocatalytic process of producing ADGV and SDGV from ADMA and SDMA, respectively, under the action 
of AGXT2 enzyme.
Thus, this study aimed to develop a method for the biosynthesis of DMGV with high yield, purity, and 
efficiency. Moreover, DMGV-related metabolites play a vital role in the occurrence and progression of metabolic 
diseases, especially ADMA and SDMA, which are important biomarkers for predicting cardiovascular 
diseases6,24. Consequently, an HPLC-MS/MS-based method was also established and comprehensively validated 
for the quantification of a panel of metabolites in the DMGV metabolic pathway, including ADGV , ADMA, 
β-aminoisobutyric acid (BAIBA), citrulline, homoarginine, NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (NMMA), SDGV , 
SDMA, and thymine with good analytical performance. The analytical method was further applied to determine 
the concentration profiles of these metabolites in human plasma samples (Fig. 1).
Materials and methods
DMGV synthesis
The chemical synthesis of ADGV mainly consists of two parts: (A) synthesis of ADMA from ornithine 1; (B) 
synthesis of ADGV from ADMA, according to the references 1,10,19. The detailed synthesis process is shown in 
the supplementary.
For biosynthesis, the gene of truncated human AGXT2Δ1-41 with a fused C-terminal His-tag was codon-
optimized and constructed into the expression vector pET28b by Genewiz (Nanjing, China). The pET28b-
AGXT2Δ1-41 plasmids were then transformed into E. Coli BL21 (DE3) competent cells by heat shock. A single 
colony of the AGXT2Δ1-41-His6 expression strain was inoculated into LB broth (100 mL) containing 50 µg/mL

kanamycin and shaken at 37 °C overnight. When the culture reached an OD600 of 0.8, protein expression was 
stimulated by adding 0.4 mM isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside and incubated at 20 °C, 200 g for 18 h.
Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000  g, 4  °C for 25  min and resuspended in phosphate buffer 
A (20 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, and 100 µM pyridoxal phosphate; pH = 7.4) 
supplemented with 1 mM phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride. Then, cells were lysed under sonication (Misonix) 
in an ice bath for 10  min at 50% amplitude with a processing time pulse of 10s and an interval of 30s. The 
lysates were centrifugated at 18,000 g, 4 °C for 1 h. The soluble supernatants were filtered with a 0.45 µM filter 
and loaded onto a pre-equilibrated HisTrap FF column (Cytavia) with the same phosphate buffer. The enzyme 
activities were measured by an ultraviolet spectrophotometer (Agilent, USA). The enzyme product was aliquoted 
and stored at -80 °C before use.
The enzymatic catalysis of ADGV was conducted overnight at room temperature using the above-mentioned 
purified human AGXT2 enzyme (2.04 mg/mL) and a reaction solution containing 30 mM ADMA, 150 mM 
glyoxylate, and 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH = 8). After lyophilization, compounds were extracted 
by protein precipitation using an organic solvent (ACN: MeOH, 9:1, v: v). After centrifugation at 18,000 g, 4 °C 
for 10  min, the supernatant was collected for further product purification and identification. Other DMGV 
standards, including d6-ADGV , SDGV , and d6-SDGV were successfully synthesized using the same protocol.
After chemical and biological synthesis, the synthesized standards were purified using preparative HPLC 
(1260 HPLC, Agilent) and qualified by HPLC-QToF MS/MS (1290II HPLC-6530 MS/MS, Agilent) and 
proton nuclear magnetic resonance  1H NMR; 400 MHz, Avance NEO, Bruker). The details are shown in the 
supplementary.
UPLC-QQQ MS/MS-based quantitative method for DMGV metabolite panel
A measurement method for a set of DMGV-related metabolites was established by using UPLC (Vanquish 
core, Thermo Scientific) coupled to a triple quadrupole (QQQ) MS/MS (TSQ Altis MS, Thermo Scientific), 
with d6-ADGV , d7-ADMA, d7-arginine, d3-BAIBA and d2-citrulline as internal standards. Moreover, method 
performance validation was carried out according to the “Guidance for Industry: M10 Bioanalytical Methods 
Validation and Study Sample Analysis” 25 and published articles 26,27. This section is described in detail in the 
supplementary materials.
Analysis of human plasma samples
Human plasma samples from the hospitals were prepared and analyzed using the same protocol as the standard 
samples in the AB Sciex 6500 QTrap MS/MS. In addition, to determine the levels of SDGV in plasma, another 
10 human plasma samples (n = 5 for each gender) were applied. Wilcoxon-Mann–Whitney test was conducted 
using R (version 4.3.0) to determine the differences in metabolites between sexes. A p-value < 0.05 was considered 
statistically significant. Detailed information can be found in the supplementary materials.
The study involving human samples was ethically approved, and all experiments were performed in 
accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.

Results and discussion
Synthesis of DMGV standards
Generally, the chemical synthesis of ADMA went through a six-step reaction, starting from Boc-Orn(Z)-OH 
(Suppl. Fig. S1A). During this process, silica gel-based purification was required after each reaction step of 
reaction to improve the product purity. Thus, the first step of the chemical synthesis from Boc-Orn(Z)-OH to 
ADMA was very time-consuming and required relatively high chemical experimental operation skills.
The second part of the chemical synthesis was the synthesis of ADGV from ADMA, which was conducted via 
a two-step reaction (Suppl. Fig. S1B). In total, this two-step reaction took about 6 h, whereas based on the ratio 
of the amount of ADMA converted after the two-step reaction to the initial amount of ADMA, the conversion 
rate was about 98.8%. By calculating the ratio of the actual amount of ADGV obtained to the theoretical amount 
of ADGV , the chemical synthesis yield was about 5.6%. After purification using preparative HPLC, the product 
purity reached 78.4% (Fig. 2A).
In contrast, the biocatalytic synthesis of ADGV from ADMA with the help of AGXT2 enzyme took about 
12 h. The AGXT2 enzyme was expressed and purified from engineered E. coli, which is highly efficient and easy 
to operate, making it particularly suitable for biological laboratories. According to the ADMA content before 
and after the reaction, the conversion rate of ADGV was about 99.6%. The product purity easily reached 97.6% 
after purification by preparative HPLC (Fig. 2B). Therefore, our experimental results showed that the established 
biocatalytic process of ADGV had a relatively high yield (~ 16.2%) and purity (~ 97.6%).
For compound structure confirmation, QToF MS/MS (m/z 71.1, 70.1, and 46.2 are the characteristic 
fragments of ADGV with [M + H]+ ion m/z 202.1; Fig.  2C) and 1H NMR (400 MHz, D 2O; δ ppm 3.65 (2H, 
t, CH2CH2CH2), 2.19 (6H, s, N-C H3 × 2), 3.16 (2H, t, CH 2CH2CH2), 1.56 (2H, t, CH 2CH2CH2; Fig.  2D) were 
used. The other DMGV standards, d6-ADGV (conversion rate = 99.7%, purity = 76.2%), SDGV (conversion 
rate = 99.5%, purity = 94.6%), and d6-SDGV (conversion rate = 99.5%, purity = 17.6%), were also catalytically 
synthesized in the study using the same protocol (Suppl. Fig. S2). To our knowledge, this is the first study on the 
biosynthesis of these endogenous compounds.
UPLC-MS/MS-based quantitative method for DMGV metabolite panel
According to published articles5,10, a quantitative method for DMGV-related metabolites was established using 
UPLC-QQQ MS/MS in MRM acquisition mode, while a protein precipitation method using organic solvents, 
which was commonly used for sample preparation was adopted. For each analyte, the product ion with the 
highest response was usually chosen as the quantifier ion, and the next highest product ion as the qualifier 
ion. Representative extracted chromatograms (EIC) and MRM parameters of these DMGV metabolites from a 
human plasma sample are shown in Fig. 3.
The DMGV metabolite panel has three pairs of isomers: ADGV and SDGV , ADMA and SDMA, and 
homoarginine and NMMA. They have the same MRM transitions and the same highest product ions, such as 
ADGV and SDGV sharing 202.1→71.1 and 70.0, ADMA and SDMA sharing 203.1→70.1, and homoarginine 
and NMMA sharing 189.1→144.1. Therefore, unique ion transitions were selected for these isomers to ensure 
quantitative accuracy when creating the panel analysis. Still, the unique product ion intensities were sometimes 
relatively low, largely affecting their detection sensitivity, especially for SDGV . Moreover, arginine was removed 
from the panel due to severe carryover after sample runs (data not shown).
Furthermore, to mimic the matrix effects of plasma, different ratios of BSA (0.1%, 1%, 5%) were tested as 
matrix samples by comparing the intensity of the internal standards in these matrix samples with that in human 
plasma. Finally, 5% BSA was chosen as a surrogate matrix. These results are shown in Suppl. Table S1.
In addition, chromatographic columns commonly used for metabolite analysis were tested. The C18 column 
(100 × 2.1 mm, 2.2 μm, Acclaim RSLC column, Thermo Fisher) had limited ability to retain these water-soluble 
metabolites, which were washed out within the first two minutes with poor selectivity. Therefore, considering 
the analytical performance of RT, selectivity, peak intensity, and peak shape, the HILIC column (150 × 2.1 mm, 
1.7 μm, Atlantis, Waters) was finally selected for analysis (Suppl. Fig. S3).
Validation of HPLC-MS/MS detection method
Linearity, accuracy, precision, and sensitivity of the calibration curves
The calibration curves were established based on eight-point concentrations using three batches of standard 
samples dissolved in 5% BSA. The linear regression models of all analytes and the Limits of Detection (LOD) 
are shown in Table 1. Overall, the standard curves of all analytes satisfied the method requirements in accuracy 
(85 ‒ 115%) and precision (< 15%; Suppl. Table S2).
The linear ranges of ADGV and SDGV calibration curves were 0.006–0.8 µM (R 2 > 0.99). The average 
accuracy of ADGV at all 8-point concentrations was 98.9% (94.8–107.2%), and their average precision was 2.9% 
(0.6–6.3%) (Suppl. Table S2a). The precision and accuracy results of other metabolites were listed in Suppl. Table 
S2. Regarding all analytes, most metabolites passed the acceptance criteria for precision and accuracy, except for 
NMMA at low levels of concentrations (0.003 and 0.006 µM).
Selectivity, specificity, and carryover of the analytes
The selectivity and specificity of the analytes and internal standards were carefully assessed by using 5% BSA as 
the matrix samples (n = 6) and human plasma samples (n = 6), respectively. There were no significant interference 
peaks at adjacent RTs of the analytes in the 5% BSA matrix samples (< 10.6% of the corresponding LLOQ level). 
The peak areas at the RTs adjacent to the internal standards were also negligible in the 5% BSA matrix samples 
(< 3.6% of the corresponding internal standards peak area; Suppl. Table S3) and in the human plasma samples 
(< 4.5% of the corresponding internal standards peak area; Suppl. Table S4).
Scientific Reports |        (2025) 15:11100 4| https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-94932-z
www.nature.com/scientificreports/
Carryover of all analytes was evaluated by running a blank sample (50% ACN) after running the standard 
mixture with the highest concentration in the calibration curve. The carryover amounts in the blank samples 
were < 4.8% of the corresponding LLOQ for all analytes (Suppl. Table S5). Thus, the method was highly selective 
for the analytes, with no significant carryover observed at the highest concentration.
Accuracy and precision of the matrix samples with spiked standards
The standard mixtures at low, medium, and high concentrations were added into the 5% BSA matrix, denoted 
as Low-matrix, Medium-matrix, and High-matrix samples. Intra- and inter-assay precision and accuracy were 
calculated for these samples (n = 6) and shown in Suppl. Table S6. Taking ADGV as an example (Suppl. Table S6a), 
the average inter-assay accuracy of ADGV was 98.6% (94.6–102.7%), and the precision was 4.7% (3.6–6.1%). 
These results are within the acceptance criteria for accuracy (100 ± 15%) and precision (< 15%), demonstrating 
Fig. 2.  HPLC chromatogram of (A) chemical synthesized ADGV and (B) biocatalytic synthesized ADGV 
after purification, (C) QTOF MS/MS spectrum, and (D) 1H NMR spectrum of biocatalytic synthesized ADGV .

the reliability and reproducibility of the assay. For the other analytes, most metabolites had high accuracy and 
precision at all 3 spiking levels, except for low levels of NMMA (Suppl. Table S6f).
Recovery of standards during extraction
The extraction process may result in loss of analytes or internal standards, so recovery was evaluated by 
comparing the peak areas of the analytes between prior-to-extraction plasma samples spiked with standards and 
post-to-extraction plasma samples spiked with standards at different concentrations. They are denoted as Low-
plasma, Medium-plasma, and High-plasma samples. The recovery results for these samples are shown in Table 2

with spiked standards. The metabolites from left to right are: (a) thymine; (b) ADGV; (c) d6-ADGV; (d)

SDMA; (l) ADMA; (m) d7-ADMA, and (B) MRM parameters of DMGV analytes in detail.

and 3. The average recoveries of all analytes ranged from 92.7 to 128.6%, which means the extraction procedure 
had relatively small impacts on the analyte concentration.
Matrix effects of ADGV in plasma samples
The matrix effect was measured by calculating the ratio of the intensity of ADGV or internal standard d6-ADGV 
added in plasma samples to the intensity in 5% BSA matrix samples and the corresponding IS-normalized MF 
(Suppl. Table S7).
The average matrix correction factor (MF) was 42.4% for ADGV and 43.9% for d6-ADGV at low, medium, 
and high spiking concentrations. The internal standard normalized matrix correction factor (IS-normalized 
MF) which is defined as the ratio of MF analyte to MF IS, was further used to evaluate the matrix effect. The IS-
normalized MFs of ADGV was 96.6% with an RSD of 8.7%, which indicates the internal standard compensated 
for the matrix effect of the analyte and eliminated interference with the detection of ADGV . In summary, the 
matrix effect on ADGV was negligible, and potential effects on quantitation were eliminated by using a stable-
isotope internal standard (Suppl. Table S7).

Reinjection reproducibility and Dilution integrity
The reinjection reproducibility of analytes at different concentrations is satisfactory (precision < 10%, 85%< 
accuracy < 115%) based on 5 replicates of standard samples, except for the low concentration of NMMA (0.006 
µM; Suppl. Table S8).
Dilution integrity assesses the effect of sample dilution on the accuracy and precision of the measured analyte 
concentrations. According to our results, the recalculated analyte concentrations were close to the original levels, 
except for NMMA in the 128-time diluted sample (0.66µM; Suppl. Table S9).
The results of reinjection reproducibility and dilution integrity showed that the analytical performance of 
NMMA at a low concentration (0.006 µM) was not good enough.
Stability studies of processed samples
Because large sample preparation should be avoided for long sequence analysis to maintain batch-to-batch 
consistency, cohort samples are typically prepared in batches of 80–120 samples per batch. A single sample 
run time was approximately 17 min. Therefore, we evaluated the stability of the processed samples after 36 h of 
storage at the autosampler temperature of 4ºC, which is equivalent to the run time of one batch of samples. The 
stabilities of the analytes in the processed samples were good after storage, except for high concentrations of 
thymine (RSD > 15%; Suppl. Table S10).
Impact of internal standards and instruments on ADGV quantification
Using stable isotope-labeled internal standards is considered the most effective way to compensate for the matrix 
effect. However, considering the cost and availability of isotope-labeled internal standards, internal standards 
can sometimes be replaced by alternatives, but their impacts on ADGV quantification have not been evaluated. 
In this study, the impacts of different internal standards (d6-ADGV , d7-arginine, d7-ADMA, d3-BAIBA, and 
d2-citrulline) on the ADGV quantification were evaluated by using plasma samples spiked with different levels 
of ADGV (0.045 and 0.650 µM).
The concentrations of ADGV were calculated using the standard curves generated with different internal 
standards. The results showed that d6-ADGV had the highest quantitative accuracy, around 92.2%, compared 
with other isotope-labeled internal standards (Fig.  4). When isotopic ADGV is not available, we would 
recommend choosing d3-BAIBA as the internal standard.
In addition, there were no distinguished differences in ADGV quantification between analytical instruments 
(Suppl. Fig. S4).
Analysis of human plasma samples
The DMGV metabolites in human plasma samples were measured using the above-established quantitative 
method (Table  4). The levels of these analytes from our population were commensurate with previous 
literatures10,13,14. We determined the concentration distribution of ADGV in healthy plasma (n = 488; [2.9–16.1 
nM]) which is within the reported range by measuring the plasma ADGV levels in 240 human subjects from 
outpatient clinics, preadmission clinics and the emergency department [1.8 to 74.2 nM]10. However, SDGV was 
reported to be less than 150 nM in recent research 13, but it was not detected in our study. It is mainly due to 
Fig. 4. ( A) ADGV standard curves using different internal standards (d6-ADGV , d7-arginine, d7-ADMA, d3-
BAIBA, and d2-citrulline) on Vanquish HPLC (Thermo Scientific) coupled to TSQ Altis MS/MS; (B) ADGV 
quantitative accuracy (%) by using different internal standards.

the low intensity of its unique product ion for quantification (m/z 171.1) in the instrument and low content of 
SDGV in healthy human plasma. The levels of the other DMGV-related metabolites in our study agree with the 
reported results from others’ studies28,29. Thus, it is feasible to incorporate these DMGV-related metabolites in 
one analytical panel.
The content of these metabolites was further compared between males and females. Several metabolites 
(ADGV , citrulline, NMMA, homoarginine, SDMA, thymine) were significantly different between genders 
(Table 4, and Suppl. Fig. S5). For instance, ADGV in males (9.4 nM [4.1–16.1]) was much higher than in females 
(6.2 nM [2.9–11.2]; P < 0.001), and SDMA in males (269.2 nM [238.5-299.2]) is also higher than female (236.5 
nM [209.1-266.3]; P < 0.001). However, obvious sexual dimorphism in the distribution of ADMA and BAIBA 
was not found.
Conclusion
The study successfully synthesized the endogenous metabolites DMGV , including ADGV , SDGV , d6-ADGV , and 
d6-SDGV , using a biocatalytic synthetic approach for the first time. Compared to the chemical synthetic method, 
the biocatalytic method is superior from the perspectives of product conversion rate, yield, product purity, and 
ease of operation. Furthermore, a targeted MS/MS-based method with high sensitivity, precision, accuracy, 
selectivity, and high throughput was established to quantify DMGV-related metabolites. The developed method 
has been applied to determine the concentration distribution of these metabolites in human plasma samples by 
measuring samples from 488 healthy participants, especially for DMGV . These findings provide an alternative 
way for DMGV synthesis and MS-based quantification, which will facilitate future mechanisms and biomarker 
studies on DMGV in different scenarios.
