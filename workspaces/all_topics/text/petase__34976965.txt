Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a mass-produced petroleum-based non-
biodegradable plastic that contributes to the global plastic pollution. Recently,
biocatalytic degradation has emerged as a viable recycling approach for PET waste,
especially with thermophilic polyester hydrolases such as a cutinase (LCC) isolated from a
leaf-branch compost metagenome and its variants. To improve the enzymatic PET
hydrolysis performance, we fused a chitin-binding domain (ChBD) from
Chitinolyticbacter meiyuanensis SYBC-H1 to the C-terminus of the previously reported
LCC
ICCG variant, demonstrating higher adsorption to PET substrates and, as a result,
improved degradation performance by up to 19.6% compared to with its precursor
enzyme without the binding module. For compare hydrolysis with different binding module,
the catalytic activity of LCC
ICCG-ChBD, LCCICCG-CBM, LCCICCG-PBM and LCCICCG-
HFB4 were further investigated with PET substrates of various crystallinity and it showed
measurable activity on high crystalline PET with 40% crystallinity. These results indicated
that fusing a polymer-binding module to LCC
ICCG is a promising method stimulating the
enzymatic hydrolysis of PET.

INTRODUCTION
Plastics are being used in an increasing number of applications in our society. As a result, improperly
disposed waste plastics have resulted in environmental pollution, which has garnered increasing
attention in recent decades. According to recent data, global plastics production has reached nearly
368 million tons in 2019 (PlasticsEurope, 2020). However, 70% of plastic waste is landﬁlled or
discarded carelessly, 11% is incinerated, and only 19% is recycled (Kaza et al., 2018). Polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) is a thermoplastic polyester synthesized with the monomers terephthalic acid
(TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG). PET has been widely used in the production of beverage bottles and
synthetic ﬁbers because of its excellent mechanical and thermal properties (Wei and Zimmermann,
2017; Kawai et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2020). Chemical and mechanical recycling of PET involve harsh
chemicals and energy-intensive physicochemical treatments ( Ragaert et al., 2017). Enzymatic
hydrolysis under mild reaction conditions has recently been recognized as an eco-friendly

alternative recycling process for PET (Wei et al., 2020). PET-
hydrolyzing enzymes, which belong to different subclasses of the
alpha-beta hydrolase family, are the most extensively studied
plastic-degrading enzymes (Chen et al., 2020). Theﬁrst reported
PET hydrolase was TfH from Thermobiﬁda fusca which can
degrade pretreated PET waste at 55
°C( Müller et al., 2005). A
synergy between different hydrolase subclasses, for example a
polyester degrading IsPETase and an oligomer degrading
IsMEHTase, has been reported in the bacterium Ideonella
sakaiensis, which is capable of metabolizing amorphous PET
(Yoshida et al., 2016). Tournier et al. recently demonstrated the
use of an engineered PET hydrolase variant in the degradation of
pre-treated post-consumer PET bottles, resulting in a >90%
depolymerization of PET waste in less than 10 h at an
industrially relevant scale. This equates to a mean productivity
of 16.7 g L
−1 h−1 of TPA which was then recovered to synthesize
virgin polymers, thereby closing the recycling loop (Tournier
et al., 2020). This ground-breaking innovation developed by the
French biotech company Carbios used the highly efﬁcient wild-
type the leaf-branch compost cutinase (LCC) (Sulaiman et al.,
2012) for protein engineering, and thermomechanical
pretreatment to reduce the crystallinity of the real-world PET
waste. This procedure successfully showcased a closed-loop bio-
recycling PET that holds great promise as a foundation for future
applications (Wei et al., 2020).
As a surface erosion process, enzymatic PET hydrolysis can be
signiﬁcantly accelerated when more biocatalysts can adsorb to the
hydrophobic polymer surface (Kawai et al., 2019). Hydrophobic
binding modules have been fused to selective PET hydrolyzing
enzymes in order to improve the enzyme sorption at water-solid
interface and thus facilitate the hydrolysis of insoluble polymer
substrates (Din et al., 1991; Ribitsch et al., 2013). Ribitsch et al.
(2015) engineered the PET cutinase Thc_Cut1 by fusing it with
two Trichoderma hydrophobins HFB4 and HFB7, resulting in a
more than 16-fold increase in PET hydrolysis efﬁciency with the
fusion variants. Similarly, they were able to modify the same
enzyme by fusing two other binding domains: the carbohydrate
binding modules (CBM) from Hypocrea jecorina and the
polyhydroxyalkanoate binding modules (PBM) from
Alcaligenes faecalis , resutling in an enhanced hydrolysis
activity on amorphous PET of up to 3.8 times (Ribitsch et al.,
2013).
Plastic polymers and plants (such as cellulose and chitin) share
chemical properties and polymer structures, including partially
crystalline regions, surface hydrophobicity and backbones linked
by hydrolysable bonds (Daly et al., 2021). The carbohydrate
binding modules (CBM), which includes the chitin-binding
domain (ChBD), is a type of noncatalytic domain found
extensively in glycoside hydrolases facilitating their adsorption
to the insoluble substrate (Boraston et al., 2004). CBMs have been
developed as useful afﬁnity tags for protein immobilization due to
their high adsorbing capacity to solid materials. For example,
Zhou et al. (2020)used chitin-binding domain as an afﬁnity tag
and achieved over 95% immobilization efﬁciency with their target
protein. Furthermore, CBMs have a broad range of hydrophobic
binding af ﬁnity with many polymer substrates including
cellulose, chitin, xylan, and starch (Oliveira et al., 2015).
In this study, protein mutants were constructed based on the
PET hydrolase variant LCC
ICCG, which has been shown by
Tournier et al. as the most active PET hydrolase to date, with
C-terminally fused binding modules including a ChBD from
Chitinolyticbacter meiyuanensis SYBC-H1 (Zhang et al., 2018),
the carbohydrate binding modules (CBM) from Hypocrea
jecorina, the polyhydroxyalkanoate binding modules (PBM)
from Alcaligenes faecalis and Trichoderma hydrophobins
HFB4. While the latter three binding modules have been used
to engineer other PET hydrolases, the ChBD was introduced to
PET hydrolases for theﬁrst time due to its similar hydrophobic
nature to CBM, which is mediated by tryptophan residues and
can promote the enzyme adsorption and, as a result, the
hydrolytic activity on PET ( Ribitsch et al., 2013 ). To
investigate the effect of the binding module on the PET-
hydrolyzing cutinase, the degradation efﬁciency with LCC
ICCG
and its fusion variants on various PET materials were evaluated in
terms of the surface adsorption, release of the degradation
products and kinetic analysis (Figure 1).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Reagents and Strains
Amorphous PETﬁlm (GF-PET, crystalline 6.7%) was purchased
from Goodfellow Ltd. (Shanhai, China, thickness of 250 µm).
Post-consumer PET waste (PCW-PET, crystalline 16%) samples
were prepared from PET ﬂakes following the pretreatment
method described previously ( Tournier et al., 2020 ). High-
crystalline PET (Hc-PET, crystalline 40%) was purchased from
Dopont Ltd. (Shanghai, China). All PET samples were cut into
pieces then immersed in liquid nitrogen for 1 min before
micronization. The percentage crystallinity of the sample is
measured by the DSC method and calculated (Tournier et al.,
2020). MHET is synthesized based a previously described method
(Kaabel et al., 2021). All other chemicals and reagents were of
analytical grade and purchased from Sahn chemical technology
Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Restriction enzymes, DNA
polymerase were purchased from TaKaRa Co., Ltd. (Dalian,
China). Escherichia coli strains were routinely cultivated
aerobically in LB medium at 37
°C. All constructs in this study
were generated with the expression vector pET-29a for
recombinant expression in E. coli BL21 (DE3). The gene
encoding LCC
ICCG cutinase, CBM, PBM and HFB4 were
synthesized based on previous studies (Ribitsch et al., 2013;
Ribitsch et al., 2015; Tournier et al., 2020) and that for ChBD
was derived from the genome ofChitinolyticbacter meiyuanensis
SYBCH1 (Zhang et al., 2018). LCCICCG cutinase and ChBD
expression strain E. coli BL21 (pET29a-LCCICCG) and E. coli
BL21 (pET29a-ChBD) were constructed in previous experiments
(Zhou et al., 2020).
Construction of Chimeric Genes and
Recombinant Plasmids
The genes were constructed using the method of splicing-by-
overlap extension (Su et al., 2006). Synthetic oligonucleotides

encoding sequences of peptide linkers was introduced between
the lcc and binding module genes. To express the fusion enzymes,
the cleavage sites for the restriction enzymesNde Iand Xho Iwere
introduce into the 5′ end oflcc and the 3′end of binding module
genes, respectively (Figure 2A). The gene fragments encoding
GFP was then inserted into the multi clone site (MCS) by one step
cloning for further investigations.
Enzyme Expression and Puriﬁcation
E. coli BL21 (DE3) harboring individual plasmids including
pET29a-LCCICCG, pET29a-LCCICCG-ChBD, pET29a-LCCICCG-
CBM, pET29a-LCC ICCG-PBM, pET29a-LCC ICCG-HFB4 and
pET29a-LCCICCG-ChBD-GFP was used to inoculate 5 ml LB
medium containing kanamycin (50 μg/ml) for incubation at
37°C and 200 rpm for 12 h. Then, a 2 ml seed culture solution
was removed to inoculate 200 ml LB medium with kanamycin
(50 μg/ml) for incubation at 37
°C and 200 rpm for 4 h. When the
OD value reached 0.6, IPTG was added at aﬁnal concentration of
1 mM to induce the recombinant protein expression by further
incubating at 18°C for 24 h. The bacterial cells were harvested by
centrifugation at 12,000 rpm at 4°C for 10 min. The obtained cell
pellets were washed twice by phosphoric buffer (50 mM, pH 8.0)
and resuspended with 50 mM phosphoric buffer (pH 8.0). Then,
the cells were disrupted by a scientz-II D ultrasonic generator and
cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 12,000 rpm and 4
°C
for 20 min. The recombinant enzyme with a C-terminal His6-tag
was puriﬁed using Ni2+-NTA resin with a Biomolecular Liquid
Chromatography System (AKTA design, GE Healthcare, US).
The target proteins were eluted with buffer NPI-250 (50 mM
NaH
2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, pH 8.0). The
puriﬁed protein was collected and concentrated by
ultraﬁltration tube to remove imidazole. Esterase activity was
determined using a slightly modiﬁed version of a previously
described method (Alisch et al., 2004). In a cuvette, 980μLo f
50 mM PBS buffer (K2HPO4/NaH2PO4, pH 8.0) was mixed with
10 μL p-nitrophenyl butyrate ( pNPB, 10 mM) dissolved in
isopropanol. The hydrolysis reaction was started by adding
10 μL of appropriately diluted enzyme solution and stopped by

adding 20μL of 1% sodium dodecyl sulfonate, after which the
absorbance was measured at 410 nm.
Kinetic Studies
The kinetic parameters for the enzymatic hydrolysis ofpNPB
were calculated based on the reaction rates determined in the
initial reaction phase during ﬁrst 3 min reaction. The kinetic
parameters for hydrolysis of amorphous PETﬁlm which was cut
into pieces then immersed in liquid nitrogen for 1 min and
micronization. obtained in the initial phase during a reaction
time of 30 min was used to determine the reaction rates. Further,
this amount was subtracted from the sum of the total soluble
hydrolysis products (TPA, MHET and BHET) obtained to
calculate the reaction rates.
Enzyme-PET Binding Assay
The puriﬁed enzyme (LCCICCG-ChBD-GFP) and the pre-treated
PET substrate were mixed thoroughly for 10 min, and centrifuged
at 12,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The adsorption efﬁciency of the
binding module to the plastic substrate was calculated based on
the protein concentrations determined in the supernatant before
and after mixing and incubation. Experiments on this adsorption
efﬁciency were carried out at different incubation temperatures
(4, 20, 40, and 65
°C) to monitor the maximum binding efﬁciency
of different enzyme variants at the temperature where the plastic
degradation was performed.
Protein concentrations were determined by the Bradford
method ( Campion et al., 2017 ). The amount of adsorbed
ChBD-GFP was determined using the ﬂuorescence intensity
detected by Hitachi F7000 ﬂuorescence spectrophotometer
similarly as describe before ( Cha and Kwon, 2018 ). The
adsorption rate was calculated with the formula below:
Adsorption rate/equals (1 −
GFP concentration in supernatant
Initial GFP concentraion )
× 100%
Hydrolysis of the PET Substrates
The enzymatic degradation of PET materials was carried out in a
500 ml reactor. The reaction began with the addition of 0.5μmol
of enzyme to 200 ml buffer (100 mM potassium phosphate buffer
pH 8) containing 120 mg of PET substrate, which was then
incubated at 65
°C under stirring at 100 rpm for 12 h. The
enzymatic depolymerization efﬁciency was calculated using the
sum amount of BHET, MHET and TPA released into the reaction
supernatants as measured by HPLC. For this calculation, the
average molecular weight of one repeating unit of the PET
polymer of 192.2 g/mol was used (Yan et al., 2021).
HPLC Analysis
The samples wereﬁltered through 0.22μm ﬁlters and analyzed by
a Shimadzu CMB-20 A HPLC system coupled with a C18 column
(InerSustain, 4.6× 250 mm, 5μm). The C18 column was eluted
with solvent (18% acetonitrile, 1% formic acid and 81% water, pH
2.5) in 0–25 min. The samples were monitored at 254 nm.
RESULT
Cloning, Expression, and Puriﬁcation of the
Fusion Proteins
The gene encoding LCCICCG-ChBD, LCCICCG-CBM, LCCICCG-
PBM and LCCICCG-HFB4 were cloned into the expression vector
pET29a. The peptide S2 was used as a linker between the PET
hydrolase and the binding module. An additional construct
pET29a-LCC
ICCG-ChBD-GFP with a gene encoding the green
ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) at a 3’downstream position to ChBD
was also created for ﬂuorescent detection of the recombinant
proteins (Figure 2A). SDS-PAGE inFigure 2Brevealed that the
LCCICCG variant, as well as the fusion proteins were obtained as
highly puriﬁed recombinant, respectively.
Kinetic Analyses of the Hydrolysis ofpNPB
and Amorphous PET Film
The kinetic parameters for the enzymatic hydrolysis ofpNPB were
determined for the fusion proteins and compared to those obtained
with LCC
ICCG (Table 1). TheKm values obtained with the fusion
proteins were signiﬁcantly higher, while the correspondingkcat/Km
value was approximatively 20% less than that of LCCICCG.B u t
instead, the kinetic parameters with amorphous PET ﬁlm as
substrate shows that the fusing proteins LCCICCG-ChBD have
low Km values (131.9μM) compared to LCCICCG (171.8μM)
mearing better substrate afﬁnity to amorphous PETﬁlm. At the
same time, LCCICCG-ChBD have about 2 timeskcat/Km than the
cutinase without binding module (Table 2).
Adsorption Rates Monitored by
Fluorescence Detection
Figure 3 showed the time courses of adsorption rates of PET
hydrolases with and without ChBD determinedﬂuorimetrically
(Figure 3B). The GFPﬂuorescence and LCC activity showed a
decent linear relationship within 24 h (Figure 3A). After 80 min
of incubation at 4°C, the maximum adsorption rate of 22.3% was
obtained with LCC ICCG-ChBD. By contrast, the saturated
adsorption rate with LCCICCG was approximately 7% which
has been achieved already after 30 min of incubation

(Figure 3C). As shown inFigure 3D, the adsorption time courses
with LCCICCG-ChBD were investigated at various temperatures.
At 40°C, the maximum adsorption efﬁciency of 30.2% was achieved
after 70 min of incubation. This is the optimal binding temperature
for the chitin binding domain used in this study according to
previous publications ( Zhou et al., 2020 ). With increasing
incubation temperature to 65
°Co r7 2 °C, the maximum
adsorption rate decreased slightly to 27% or 23.5%, which was
achieved after 2 h incubation and considered beneﬁcial for the
enzymatic plastic degradation carried out at this temperature.
Degradation Time Course of GF-PET
Powder by Fusion Enzymes
Figure 4showed the time course study of the GF PET degradation
by the cutinase variant with and without various binding modules
in terms of the release of HPLC detectable hydrolysis products. In
all samples, mono (2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) is the
most abundant product followed by terephthalic acid (TPA), and
bis (2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET). During the total
incubation time up to 12 h, the levels of released TPA and
MHET increased continuously. After 12 h reaction at 65
°C,
LCCICCG yielded 2.12 mM hydrolysis products composed of
0.76 mM TPA, 1.25 mM MHET and 0.11 mM BHET
(Figure 4A). LCC
ICCG-ChBD showed a higher activity against
the GF-PET, releasing 0.92 mM TPA, 1.5 mM MHET and
0.32 mM BHET after 12 h incubation, accounting for 29%
more yield in total product amount than that without binding
module (Figure 4A). In comparison, the highest amount of
degradation products composed of 1.23 mM TPA, 1.56 mM
MHET and 0.25 mM BHET was yielded with LCC
ICCG-CBM,
and is 14% higher than with LCCICCG-ChBD (Figure 4A). The
yield of degradation products with LCCICCG-PBM and LCCICCG-
HFB4 was comparable or slightly lower than that with LCCICCG,
indicating that the fusion of PBM and HFB4 to LCCICCG might
have weakly impaired its catalytic activity. As shown in
FIGURE 3 |Time courses of production(A) and the adsorption of LCCICCG and LCCICCG-ChBD to GF-PETﬁlms monitored byﬂuorescence analysis(B,C) and at
different incubation temperatures(D).

Xue et al. Plastics Wastes Depolymerization
Figure 4B, depolymerization degrees of 87.5 and 98.5% were
achieved with LCCICCG-ChBD and LCCICCG-CBM, respectively,
which are 19.6 and 30.6% higher than that obtained with the
enzyme without binding modules (Figure 4B).
Hydrolysis of PET Substrates With Different
Crystallinity
PET substrates with different crystallinity, such as GF-PET
(6.7%), Pcw-PET (16%) and Hc-PET (40%), were used to
investigate the effect of crystallinity on the degradation
performance catalyzed by various cutinase versions.
Figure 5 indicated that the effectiveness of enzymatic
hydrolysis decreased signi ﬁcantly as polymer crystallinity
increased. LCC
ICCG , in particular, was nearly impossible to
break down Hc-PET exhibiting only 0.029 mM hydrolysis
products released after 12 h. Interestingly, the fusion
enzymes LCC
ICCG -ChBD and LCC ICCG -CBM showed
markedly increased depolymerization performance against
Hc-PET by releasing 0.335 and 0.215 mM hydrolysis

products, respectively, which are 11.6 and 7.1 times higher
than without binding modules. The superior activity of
LCC
ICCG -ChBD and LCC ICCG -CBM was noticeable against
all three PET substrates with different crystallinity.
Furthermore, ChBD outperform other binding modules in
facilitating the breakdown of Hc-PET materials.

DISCUSSION
Carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) including ChBD have a high
adsorption capacity to a variety of insoluble substrates. These
characteristics enable the potential application CBM proteins
function as adhesive in food industry, biomedicine,
environmental protection and molecular biology. In this study,
we employed ChBD to construct a novel fusion enzyme variant
for enhanced hydrolysis of synthetic polyesters. To that purposed, an
engineered cutinase (LCC
ICCG)( Tournier et al., 2020) previously
published for PET hydrolysis was fused with a C-terminal chitin-
binding module from chitinase CmChi1 fromChitinolyticbacter
meiyuanensis SYBCH1 (LCC
ICCG-ChBD). This ChBD belongs to
carbohydrate-binding modules, which have a similar interaction
mechanism with insoluble polymers that involves hydrophobic
interactions through tryptophan residues. The ChBD is fused to
LCC
ICCG via a linker region (S2), which has been described as an
appropriate linker peptide that can be introduced between distinct
enzymes to avoid folding interference from each other allowing the
two moieties of a fusion enzyme to function as independently as
possible (Lu and Feng, 2008).
The hydrolysis of GF-PET, an amorphous PET material
commonly used to study other PET hydrolases, showed
intriguing mechanistic insights based on varied ratios of
hydrolysis products released by the fusion enzyme and its
precursor (Wei et al., 2019; Tiso et al., 2021; Yan et al., 2021).
When compared to LCC
ICCG -ChBD, the one without binding
module produced lower amounts of hydrolysis products.
LCCICCG initially released comparable amounts of all
hydrolysis products, but the levels of increasing release of
MHET and TPA were comparable later in the incubation
stage. The ratios of MHET and TPA were nearly unchanged
following hydrolysis, regardless of whether the fused protein
or its precursor was used. This suggests that the inclusion of
the chitin binding module may aid in the depolymerization of
the oligomeric PET-related molecules. The results of kinetic
characterization further support this view. LCC
ICCG -ChBD
showed a lower Km value for the pNPB hydrolysis than that
with its precursor enzyme, indicating a reduced substrate afﬁnity to
the soluble model compound. As a result, the catalytic efﬁciency
(kcat/Km) of the enzyme carrying ChBD (0.404 s−1/μM) was slightly
lower than that measured for LCCICCG (0.534 s−1/μM). LCCICCG-
ChBD, on the other hand, has a higher catalytic efﬁciency (kcat/Km)
and depolymerization rate on polymers with various crystallinity
than the one without binding module. In general, the addition of
ChBD did not appear to considerably improve the depolymerization
of PET-related oligomers, although the enhanced depolymerization
efﬁciency of PET polymers was more pronounced. This could be
related to the mechanism of the binding module which can
potentially destroy the structures of the polymers like celluloses,
releasing more accessible bonds to the enzymatic degradation (Din
et al., 1991). However, as for PET polymers, more experimental
evidence in this context is still required.
In this study, we also compared the promoting effect of the
ChBD Chitinolyticbacter meiyuanensis with three other binding
domains: cellulose–binding domain (CBM) of cellobiohydrolase
If r o mTrichoderma reesei (TrCBH), polyhydroxyalkanoate
binding modules (PBM) from Alcaligenes faecalis and
hydrophobin HFB4 from T. reesei QM6a, which have been
previously reported to signiﬁcantly improve PET degradation
efﬁciency when fused to another PET hydrolase. By fusing to the
hydrolase variant LCC
ICCG, our results (Figures 4, 5)s h o w e d
that CBM and ChBD can enhance the hydrolysis of PET samples
with different crystallinity. When high-crystalline PET was used
as the substrate, the enzyme with ChBD fusion released
11.6 times more degradation products, indicating its
superiority in promoting the breakdown of Hc-PET
materials. With amorphisi zed PET sample, the increased
degradation performance by 19.6% with the fused ChBD
could be attributed to an increased adsorption capacity to
PET by up to 27%. As a result, more research is needed to
understand why ChBD improves PET hydrolase to different
levels against PET with varying crystallinity. In addition,
mutagenesis of ChBD by protein engineering approaches
may facilitate to gain a better knowledge on its binding
process to PET, similarly as previously reported with other
CBMs (Weber et al., 2019 ). Because ChBD has an optimal
temperature for PET binding at 40
°C, which is signiﬁcantly
lower than the optimal breakdown temperature of PET
catalyzed by LCC variants, enhancing the thermal stability of
ChBD may be another useful strategy for improving the overall
degradation efﬁcacy catalyzed by the fusion protein.
CONCLUSION
We have successfully fused a chitin binding domain to LCCICCG,
a cutinase variant with outstanding PET hydrolytic activity. The
fusion protein was functionally expressed inE. coliand showed an
enhanced adsorption capacity to PET ﬁlms by ﬂuorescence
detection. As a result, the fusion protein with ChBD
demonstrated improved degradation performance on all
investigated PET materials as indicated by the higher release
of degradation products than that obtained with LCC
ICCG. The
improved hydrolytic activity of LCCICCG-ChBD led to detectable
