Using a synthetic machinery to improve
carbon yield with acetylphosphate as
the core

In microbial cell factory, CO2 release during acetyl-CoA production from
pyruvate signiﬁcantly decreases the carbon atom economy. Here, we con-
struct and optimize a synthetic carbon conserving pathway named as Sedo-
heptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase Cyclewith Trifunctional PhosphoKetolase
(SCTPK) inEscherichia coli. This cycle relies on a generalist phosphoketolase
Xfspk and converts glucose into the stoichiometric amounts of acetylpho-
sphate (AcP). Furthermore, genetic circuits responding to AcP positively or
negatively are created. Together with SCTPK, they constitute a gene-metabolic
oscillator that regulates Xfspk and enzymes converting AcP into valuable
chemicals in response to intracellularAcP level autonomously, allocating
metabolic ﬂux rationally and improving the carbon atom economy of bio-
conversion process. Using this synthetic machinery, mevalonate is produced
with a yield higher than its native theoretical yield, and the highest titer and
yield of 3-hydroxypropionate via malonyl-CoA pathway are achieved. This
study provides a strategy for improving the carbon yield of microbial cell
factories.
Recently, bioproduction of desired chemicals and materials is getting
momentum due to their environmental friendliness and practical
feasibility. In microbial cell factories design and construction pro-
cesses, a key issue is to improve theﬂuxes towards the product of
interest and to maximize the carbon atom economy

important especially under the global achievement of carbon peak and
carbon neutrality. The core of any metabolic network in microorgan-
ism is a high-ﬂux backbone, generally referred to as the central
metabolism
2, responsible for the transformation of primary input
substrates into energy and a series of building blocks for the produc-
tion of cellular polymers and considered as the invariable operating
system of the cell
3. Therefore, if we want to build a synthetic machinery
that convert a living organism into a truly productive biofactory, apart
from optimizing the biosynthetic pathway as standalone unit, a suc-
cessful bioengineering approach must also bend the endogenous
metabolic network of the host, especially its central metabolism, to
support the bioproduction process
4. In microorganism, acetyl coen-
zyme A (acetyl-CoA) is not only a fundamental metabolite in central
metabolic pathways, but also a precursor for numerous industrially
relevant products
5–7. So, rewriting the microorganism’s central meta-
bolism to supply plenty acetyl-CoA with high carbon atom economy
will beneﬁt the bioproduction of a wide variety of chemicals and
materials.
To improve the acetyl-CoA yield, a typical strategy is the elim-
ination of carbonﬂux to competing pathways and the overexpression
of important enzyme to ensure sufﬁcient production of acetyl-CoA8,9.
This approach is more straightforward and simpler in design, but does
not actually increase the theoretical carbon yield of the target che-
mical. Natural microorganisms usually convert glucose into acetyl-CoA
through the glycolysis pathway together with decarboxylation of
pyruvate by the pyruvate dehydrogenase, in which 2 mol of acetyl-CoA
and 2 mol of CO
2 are generated from each mol of glucose10.T h i s

this problem, a synthetic non-oxidative glycolysis (NOG) route was
developed (Supplementary Fig. 1), converting glucose into the stoi-
chiometric amounts of acetylphosphate (AcP), which is further cata-

conﬁguration relies on carbon rearrangement and phosphoketolase
which catalyzes the irreversible conversion of fructose-6-phosphate
(F6P) or xylulose-5-phosphate (X5P) into AcP and erythrose-4-
phosphate (E4P) or glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAP), respectively.
Recently, based on mathematical modeling, Andersen et al. pro-
posed a new variant of the NOG pathway with introduction of a novel
phosphoketolase activity towards sedoheptulose-7-phosphate (S7P)
13.
Subsequently, Hellgren et al. constructed the proposed NOG variant in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae14. The phosphoketolase fromBiﬁdobacter-
ium longum, which was shown to act upon S7P, F6P and X5P (Xfspk),
together with an endogenous sedo heptulose-1,7-bisphosphatase
(SBPase), were overexpressed to form a sedoheptulose-1,7-bispho-
sphate (SBP) -dependent cycle pathway (Fig.1 and Supplementary
Fig. 1). Similar with NOG pathway, this route converts each mol glucose
into 3 mol AcP with consumption of 1 mol ATP, and there is no net
production or consumption of reducing power (Supplementary
Data 1). On the other hand, the SBP-dependent cycle is the shortest
carbon conservation pathway, requiring only 6 enzymes while 8
enzymes in NOG. It no longer requires transaldolase and transketolase
for carbon rearrangement as NOG pathway, reducing the number of
involved enzymes and the complexity of this pathway, representing
the carbon atom economy as well as the protein economy. However,
that study was just a proof-of-concept and engineered yeast strains
carrying the SBP-dependent cycle still presented low yield of acetyl-
CoA derived chemicals from glucose
14. Besides S. cerevisiae, Escher-
ichia coliis also a host microorganism of choice for bioproduction. In
this study, this SBP-dependent cycle is named after its characteristic
intermediate and enzyme as SBP Cycle with Trifunctional Phospho-
Ketolase (SCTPK), and will be evaluated and optimized inE. coli.
The output of the SCTPK is AcP, which is not only a key regulatory
node for central metabolism, but also a global signal affecting diverse
cellular processes via protein post-translational modiﬁcation

engineered strain carrying SCTPK. The Ntr system, consisting of the
sensor NRII (glnL product) and the response regulator NRI (glnG pro-
duct), controls a transcriptional response to nitrogen starvation20.
When NRII is absent, NRI itself can sense the AcP level and activate the
glnAp2 promoter accordingly21. As the Ntr system plays a negligible
role under most bioreactor conditions, NRII was knocked out and NRI
was recruited as a dynamic controller to activate the expression of
lycopene biosynthetic genes in response to the glycolyticﬂux indi-
cator AcP in engineeredE. colistrain, resulting in improved lycopene
production
21. This was theﬁrst example of dynamic control based on
sensing of a certain metabolite. Furthermore, AcP-centered oscillators
were designed with the introduction of AcP-induced LacI repressor
that would block the expression of NRI from theglnAp2 promoter
22 or
Pta that converts acetyl-CoA into AcP23. Therefore, NRI-based genetic
circuits with appropriate properties are capable to control expression
of related genes in response to AcP level, and will help to maintain the
intracellular AcP homeostasis. Moreover, dynamic control of meta-
bolic ﬂux relying on biosensor responding to certain metabolite has
shown promise for not only rational allocation of intracellular
resources, but also improvements in yield and titer of target product,
and avoidance of metabolic burden and toxic accumulation
24.
In this study, we construct a synthetic machinery to improve
carbon yield with AcP as the core, usingE. coli as the host (Fig.1).
Firstly, SCTPK is assembled by overexpression of Xfspk and SBPase,
and improved by repressing expression of competing enzymes using
antisense RNA (asRNA) interference. Secondly, a series of genetic cir-
cuits activated or repressed by AcP, the product of SCTPK, are devel-
oped, forming a gene-metabolic oscillator responding to intracellular
AcP level. Thirdly, the synthetic machinery increases the production
and yield of some industrially relevant products including
3-hydroxypropionate (3HP), polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) and mevalo-
nate (MVA) when growing on glucose.
Results
Construction of the carbon conservation pathway SCTPK in
E. coli
The SCTPK employs six enzymes, and all enzymes, except Xfspk and
SBPase, are already present inE. coli(Fig.2a). For SBPase, Shb17 fromS.
cerevisiaewas characterized to catalyze the speciﬁc dephosphorylation
of SBP25, and it was reported that some fructose-1,6-biphosphatases
(FBPases) with highly conserved lithium-binding domains have pro-
miscuous activity as SBPase
26,27. Therefore, genes encoding Shb17 and
FBPases with this feature from diverse bacteria (Supplementary Fig. 2)
were synthesized and expressed inE. coliBL21(DE3) strain, and corre-
sponding proteins fused with an His
6-tag were puriﬁed (Supplementary
Fig. 3). In addition, His6-tagged FbaA fromE. coli, FBP aldolase which
catalyzes the condensation of E4Pand dihydroxyacetone phosphate
(DHAP)28,w a sa l s op u r iﬁed to provide the commercially unavailable
SBP for the in vitro activity assay of SBPase and Xfspk. As shown in
Fig. 2b, GlpX fromSynechocystissp. PCC6803 (SyGlpX) presented the
highest SBPase activity, probably because the SBPase activity is
required for the Calvin-Benson cycle for CO
2 ﬁxation in
cyanobacteria29. When the FBPase assay results (Supplementary Fig. 4)
was also taken into account, SyGlpX was selected as both SBPase and
FBPase activities were required for construction of the SCTPK: SBPase
provides the second irreversible driving force of this cycle, and FBPase
decreases the glycolyticﬂux and pushes the carbonﬂow into the
SCTPK. The Xfspk fromB. longumwas employed to produce AcP from
the aldol cleavage reaction of S7P, F6P and X5P, and this protein was
also puriﬁed and validated by in vitro activity assay (Fig.2c). As Xfspk
activity was lower than that of SBPase, thexfspk gene will be carried by
a high-copy plasmid to increase its expression level, andglpX gene of
Synechocystissp. PCC6803 will be integrated intoE. coligenome under
the control of a constitutive strong promoter P
j23119 (Supplementary
Fig. 5) in the following strain construction.
To assemble the SCTPK in vivo, anE. coliBW25113 mutant Q3952
was developed as the starting strain, in whichtktAB and talAB genes,
responsible for the carbon rearrangement, were knocked out to
exclude the interference of NOG pathway, and genes related with
byproducts acetate, lactate, ethanol and formate (poxB, ldhA, adhE,
pﬂB) were deleted to eliminate carbon loss (Fig.2a). Further, the acetyl-
CoA production from pyruvate decarboxylation was blocked by dele-
tion ofaceE gene, resulting in growth deﬁciency in both modiﬁed M9
medium containing 1 g/L yeast extract and LB medium, which could be
compensated by addition of exogenous potassium acetate (Fig.2da n d
Supplementary Fig. 6). In contrast, the strain Q3964 generated by
introduction of Xfspk and SyGlpX into Q3952ΔaceE recovered from
t h eg r o w t hi n c a p a b i l i t y( F i g .2d, f), demonstrating that the acetyl-CoA
pool was replenished by the constructed SCTPK. Furthermore, thegnd
gene was deleted, that should lead to depletion of ribose-5-phosphate
(R5P), the precursor for nucleotides and histidine synthesis, in a strain
deﬁcient in carbon rearrangement. However, thegnd mutant grew as
well as its parent strain, indicating that R5P could be generated as an
intermediate of the SCTPK, which is conﬁrmed by the fact that agnd
mutant with incomplete SCTPK could not grow even with the presence
of potassium acetate (Fig.2e, f). All these results demonstrated that the
SCTPK functions well in vivo, and can generate acetyl-CoA in a way that
bypass the carbon release process from pyruvate to acetyl-CoA.
The metabolites content in the strain integrating the SCTPK was
subsequently tested and showed that the AcP concentration is 1.79-
fold higher than that in the wild-type strain (Fig.2g), indicating that our
engineering strategy does increase the AcP production. In the strain
Q3952 aceE, the intracellular pyruvate concentration was 2.34-fold
higher than that of the wild-type strain, and it was signiﬁcantly
decreased by the overexpression of Xfspk and SyGlpX, but remaining
higher than the wild strain (Fig.2h), suggesting that further optimi-
zation is required to pull the carbonﬂux into the SCTPK to increase
carbon yield.
Optimization of the SCTPK for higher AcP production
In the strain with the SCTPK, it was noticed that some enzymes may
shunt this pathway and therefore cause carbon loss (Fig.3a). Among
them, PfkA catalyzes the reactions of F6P to FBP, and S7P to SBP, both
of which are inverse reactions of SBPase; GapA enables the production
of glycerate-1,3-bisphosphate (BPG), which enters the glycolysis to
produce pyruvate; GapB converts E4P into 4-phospho-
D-erythronate
(4PE), an inhibitor of R5P isomerase (Rpi)30 involved in the SCTPK. So,
it was planned to knock down expression of these genes using asRNA
interference.
As reported previously
31, a double-strand stem structure, which is
created with inverted repeatsﬂanking the asRNA, could stabilize the
secondary structure of asRNA and enhance gene silencing efﬁciency
and duration (Supplementary Fig. 7a), and our results ulteriorly illu-
strated that the asRNA length and transcription level, which is affected
by its promoter and gene copy number, synergistically determined the
efﬁciency of asRNA silencing (Fig.3b and Supplementary Fig. 7). Then,
the target genespfkA, gapA and gapB were inhibited individually with
100-nt asRNA transcribed by strong promoter P
j23119,a n dt h eA c P
content was detected. As shown in Fig.3c, when expression ofpfkA
gene was suppressed, the AcP concentration was 2.23-time and 1.24-
time higher than the wild-type strain and Q3964, respectively. How-
ever, high-level asRNAs targeting gapA and gapB dramatically
decreased the AcP content as well as theﬁnal cell density and speciﬁc
growth rate (Fig.3c, d). In strains with corresponding asRNAs, the
transcription ofgapA, gapB and pkfA was reduced to 4.9%, 6.7%, and
27.2% of that of the control strain having only double-strand stem but
not asRNA sequence (Fig.3e). These results indicated that strong
repression of expression ofgapA and gapB severely impaired the cell
growth probably due to their irreplaceable role in glycolysis and vita-
min B6 synthesis (Supplementary Fig. 8).

Following, combinationally regulated strains with highly inhibited
pfkA and moderate or weak repression ofgapB (80-nt asRNA with
Pj23119 or Pj23118 promoter respectively) were constructed (Supple-
mentary Figs. 9 and 10), and phenotypic detection showed that weak
repression ofgapB gene increased intracellular AcP concentration to
2.45 times higher than that of the wild-type strain although theﬁnal cell
density and growth rate was slightly decreased (Fig.3f, g). Then,
modules mediating moderate or weak repression ofgapA were intro-
duced, and moderate repression ofgapA gene increased the AcP
concentration to the highest level, which was 2.83 times higher than
that of the wild-type strain, and did not affect the cell growth drama-
tically (Fig.3f, g). This strain with highly repressedpfkA, moderately
repressed gapA and weakly repressedgapB was the best among all
constructed strains, and was named as Q4531. As a comparison, a strain
with all three genes being repressed moderately presented a bit
weaker performance in both AcP production and cell growth, indi-
cating that a hierarchical regulatory system for different genes is
conducive to improve the carbon yield of the SCTPK.
Subsequently, the CO
2 release from wild-typeE. coliBW25113 and
Q4531 strain was determined. The CO2 release rate underwent sig-
niﬁcant changes over cultivation process, and the Q4531 strain pre-
sented a maximum CO2 emission rate of 4.20 mL/h, less than one-third
of that of BW25113 strain (Fig.3h). The total CO2 release of Q4531 strain
decreased to 47.4% compared with wild-typeE. coli(Fig.3i). Moreover,
the strain Q4531 showed a signiﬁcant decrease in pyruvate con-
centration relative to the wild-type strain and Q3964 (Fig.3j), sug-
gesting that the metabolicﬂow more shifted to the SCTPK following
gene silencing with combinational asRNA arrays. Furthermore, the
strain Q4531 showed an acetate accumulation capacity only repre-
senting 11% of the wild-type strain (Fig.3k). So far, combinational
asRNA arrays have further enhanced the effectiveness of the designed
SCTPK, enhanced the production of AcP and repressed the release of
CO
2 and accumulation of byproducts, resulting in improved carbon
atom economy. In addition, it was conformed that the repeat
sequences to form paired termini of asRNAs did not impair the genetic
stability of corresponding plasmids (Supplementary Fig. 10).

Design and characterization of dynamic AcP-activated genetic
circuits
As NRI protein can be directly phosphylated by AcP, it was employed
here to sense AcP and modulate gene expression accordingly. Phos-
phorylated NRI is capable of binding to enhancer sequences upstream
the promoterglnAp2, interacting frequently with theσ54-RNA poly-
merase assembled atglnAp2, and initiating the transcription32 (Fig.4a).
In addition, low-afﬁnity sites for NRI-P that locates between the
enhancer and theglnAp2 promoter constitute a governor, limiting the
maximum promoter activity at high concentrations of NRI-P33.
To make this promoter AcP-inducible, theglnL gene was deleted,
which did not affect the growth ofE. coliobviously (Supplementary
Fig. 11). InE. colichromosome, theglnLG operon locates just down-
stream of theglnA gene, and theglnA terminator (TglnA) is not effective
enough to completely stop the transcription34, resulting in a self-
activating feedforward loop of NRI, which is conﬁrmed by our results
obtained from a strain carrying blue and redﬂuorescent protein genes
ﬂanking TglnA (Fig. 4b). To prevent the interference from NRI level
increasing with time, a strong terminatorrrnB T1 was introduced in
front of the native TglnA, which shut off the expression of redﬂuor-
escent protein and decreased the readthrough coefﬁcient from 0.76 to
0.06 (Fig.4b and Supplementary Fig. 12), suggesting the feedback loop
was eliminated. These provided us a platform strain to construct the
NRI-dependent AcP-responding genetic circuit.
Following, the AND-gate based circuit AI was constructed using
AcP and NRI as dual inputs and greenﬂuorescent protein (GFP) as
reporter (Fig.4c), and the dose-response of AcP was determined. The
ﬂuorescence intensity showed a tendency to increase and then
decrease when AcP concentration was elevated (Fig. 4d). It was
speculated that this nonmonotonic phenomenon was caused by the
governor sequence which sets the upper boundary of expression from
glnAp2 promoter. Therefore, the governor was mutated to generate
circuit AII, which presented a monotonic increasing response curve
(Fig. 4d). To enhance the transcriptional strength fromglnAp2 pro-
moter,glnG gene was overexpressed from a plasmid under the control
of P
j23118 promoter instead of the genomic locus, resulting in the
maximum GFPﬂuorescence 3.82-time higher than that of genetic cir-
cuit AII and a dynamic range of 10.4-fold (Fig.4d, e).
To further improve the dynamic range and obtain a richer
response characteristic to AcP, the interaction of NRI and enhancer
was investigated comprehensively and the enhancer sequence was
mutated accordingly. A helix-turn-helix (HTH) domain in the
C-terminal region ofE. coli NRI was identiﬁed to have functions of
enhancer recognition and DNA binding based on the following facts:
this domain is conserved in NRIs from diverse species (Supplementary
Fig. 13a), it contains three conserved residues (Arg456, Asn457 and
Arg461) playing essential role in afﬁnity for DNA inSalmonellaTyphi-
murium NRI
35,a n dE. coliNRI with a mutated HTH domain no longer
responded to the AcP level (Supplementary Fig. 13b). Subsequently,
the complex structure of DNA andE. coliNRI HTH domain was simu-
lated using the binary structure ofAquifex aeolicusNtrC4 HTH domain
and double-stranded DNA (PDB: 4FTH) as template (Fig.4f), and the
result suggested that a DNA sequence GGTGCA formed the most
stable complex with those three conserved amino acid residues
through hydrogen bond and electrostatic force (Fig.4g). Based on this
structure, three enhancer sequences with different afﬁnity for NRI
were designed to replace the native enhancer sites 1 and 2 ofglnAp2
promoter in genetic circuit AIII (Fig.4g, h), resulting in a small library
containing nine mutatedglnAp2 promoters. All these biosensors still
showed a response to AcP concentration, and it seemed that the
enhancer’sa fﬁnity for NRI corelated positively with the strength of
glnAp2 promoter i.e., theﬂuorescence intensity at a certain AcP con-
centration, but corelated negatively with the dynamic range of corre-
sponding biosensors (Fig.4i). Taken together, the circuit AIIIf was
selected with the highest dynamic range of 30.3-fold, low basal leakage
expression and acceptable expression strength at high AcP
level (Fig.4d).
Next, the expression of NRI was adjusted. When theglnGgene was
overexpressed under control of a weaker promoter P
j23116, the dynamic
range increased to 57.1-fold, however, the maximum output signal was
lower than that of the circuit AIIIf (Fig.4d, e). In the case that theglnG
gene was expressed from its original genomic locus, the maximum
output signal dropped further, and the dynamic range was 27.9-fold
(Fig. 4d, e). Collectively, a series of AcP-activated genetic circuits with
different switching time, regulatory intensities and dynamic ranges
were obtained by adjusting the cis-acting sequences (enhancers and
governors) and trans-acting element NRI expression of the promoter
glnAp2.
Design and characterization of dynamic AcP-inhibited genetic
circuits
The AcP negative-response genetic circuit was constructed based on
the following idea, that is, the genomic promoterglnAp2with mutated
governor sequence is used to modulate the expression of a tran-
scriptional repressor PhlF fromPseudomonasﬂuorescens
36,w h i c hw i l l
repress expression of the reporter genegfp from the protomer PphlF
(Fig. 5a). In the strain carrying an initial construct RI, the PhlF protein
was expressed speciﬁcally in response of AcP addition (Fig. 5b).
Moreover, AcP-dependent repression of GFP ﬂuorescence was
observed, and this repression was undermined by addition of 2,4-
deacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG) which can bind to and release PhlF
protein from P
phlF promoter (Fig.5c), suggesting that the repression
was mediated by the PhlF repressor but not a direct effect of AcP.
However, this strain presented high response threshold of AcP and
quantitative leaky expression at high AcP concentration.
To improve this repression conﬁguration, an extra copy of PhlF
binding sitephlO was inserted into the P
phlF promoter to strengthen
the afﬁnity of PhlF repressor for this promoter. Between the−35 and
−10 regions of the PphlF promoter, a 24-bp sequence containing
inverted repeats was regarded as putativephlO operator, and its
mutation totally abolished the PhlF-mediated repression on the PphlF
promoter (Fig.5c). Following, one and two copies ofphlO operator
were insert downstream of the transcription start site respectively as
shown in Fig.5d. Surprisingly, a stepwise decrease inﬂuorescence was
observed even with the absence of PhlF protein after the insertion of
phlOs, but thegfp mRNA level was not signiﬁcantly changed (Fig.5d). It
was believed that this phenomenon was caused by the secondary
structure of 5′-untranslated region which was stabilized by additional
phlO sequence (Supplementary Fig. 14) and affected the translation
initiation of downstream genes. Then, aphlO operator was inserted
upstream the P
phlF promoter with the distance between the centers of
two phlO sequences of 63-bp. However, this insertion didn’tc h a n g e
the expression pattern of GFP with the presence and absence of PhlF
protein neither (RIII in Fig.5e and Supplementary Fig. 15).
To make these operators acting synergistically, one method is
generation of DNA looping by a protein or protein complex that
simultaneously binds to two detached sites on a DNA molecule
37.A s
PhlF protein usually forms a dimer binding to two inverted repeats in a
phlO operator and cannot form higher-order complex
36, it was fused
with C-terminal domain of theλ repressor cI38 which mediates an
intermolecular interaction resulting in the cooperative binding of two
PhlF dimers to adjacentphlO operators (Fig.5e). As we had expected,
introduction of the oligomerization domain reduced the response
threshold of AcP and leaky expression effectively. Subsequently, sev-
eral peptide linkers were inserted between PhlF and cI domain,
respectively, to increase spatial separation and to avoid the mutual
interference between domains. Among them, the linker (PT)4 P
showed the highest execution of suppression (Fig.5e).
Next, the distance between twophlO operators was adjusted to
explore its effect on DNA looping. As shown in Fig.5f, theﬂuorescence

output increased as thephlOup was gradually moved away, and the
DNA looping-dependent repression mainly functioned in the distance
range of 47–297 bp. Moreover, the spacer was further reﬁned to 48, 50,
52…78, 80 bp, and the output signal showed a distance-related peri-
odic ﬂuctuation with a period of 11-bp, which is exactly the number of
base pairs per helical turn of double-stranded DNA (Fig.5g). These
results suggested that formation of DNA looping is affected by the
relative direction of two operators on DNA molecule. Speciﬁcally,
when the two operators are positionally deﬂected or located on
opposite sides, the DNA looping will be structurally unstable due to the
rigid action of DNA helix, resulting in a decrease in its repression
performance. In addition, it was proved that the space packing formed
between phlO
up and PphlF promoter was neglectable and does not
affect the transcription from PphlF promoter as long as their distance
was over 7 bp (Supplementary Fig. 16). Furthermore, the AcP response

different distance of two phlO operators of 60, 63, and 66 bp,
respectively (Fig.5h) were conﬁrmed. The results showed that all three
genetic circuits presented signiﬁcantly improved repression proﬁle
than the initial construct, and the one with 66-bp spacer betweenphlO
operators has faster signal response, better cooperative ability, and
lower leakage expression than the others.
Finally, the portability of the dynamic AcP-activated and -inhibited
genetic circuits were veriﬁed by replacing the reporter GFP withβ-
galactosidase (β-gal), and appropriate expression proﬁle ofβ-gal was
obtained under conditions with various intracellular AcP concentra-
tions (Supplementary Fig. 17). In summary, a series of AcP responsive
genetic circuits with different properties were constructed, and can be
used to control expression of metabolic enzymes.
Establishment of AcP-centered oscillation system
As dynamic expression of metabolic genes is able to better manage the
trade-offs between growth and production and can enhance the yield
and titer of target products
24, the AcP-responding circuits will be
employed to control the transcription of genes related in AcP produ-
cing and consuming routes. In speciﬁc, the AcP-activated circuits are
used to control the AcP consumption route, that is, the acetyl-CoA
production catalyzed by phosphate acetyltransferase (Pta), and the
AcP-inhibited circuits are used to control the AcP generation catalyzed
by Xfspk in SCTPK. As a consequence, bacterial fate is going to be
divided into two modes of mutual cycling (Fig.6a). The manifestation
and alternation of these two fates will be determined only by the
intracellular concentration of AcP.
To implement this scheme, the constructed activating circuit AI
was used to control transcription of genespta and mcherry,a sw e l la s
circuit RI to control expression ofxfspk and gfp, to generate a proto-
type device I (Supplementary Fig. 18). As expected, theﬂuorescence
expression curves suggested that GFP and mCherry exhibited oscilla-
tory expression in opposite phases. However, a higher amplitude of
GFP than mCherry was observed and the oscillatory expression gra-
dually became blurred after two cycles (Fig.6b). In oscillator II, the
glnAp2 promoter was replaced by its derivative with optimized
enhancer sequence, resulting in a reduced expression leakage of
mCherry, but the oscillatory behavior was still unsustainable (Fig.6c).
Next, in oscillator III, the activator NRI was expressed from a
plasmid under control of P
j23116 promotor instead of its genomic locus
to increase the NRI level, and the deterrent driver of the repression
branch was switched to engineered PhlF-(PT)4P-cIa n dP
phlF promoter
with doublephlO operators to improve the repression efﬁciency. As a
consequence, a sustained oscillatory state with a cycle of about 12 h
was observed, and two modules had similar amplitudes and opposite
phases, demonstrating that this device had a better synchronization
tunability, higher robustness, and stronger resistance to noise
(Fig. 6d). Further increase of NRI level by using a stronger promoter
P
j23118 in oscillator IV accelerated the oscillatory rhythm, resulting in
the switch of two modes in every 9 h (Fig.6e). However, there was a
certain degree of leakage expression ofmCherrygene in the activation
module, and the amplitude of mCherry was also higher than that of
GFP. To lower the background expression of mCherry, thelacI gene
was placed downstream of the P
phlF promotor in the repression
module to produce the repressor LacI negatively correlating with
intracellular AcP level which will block theglnAp2 promotor in the
activation module. Interestingly, this not only reduced the mCherry
expression and prolonged the switchover time compared with Oscil-
lator IV, but also lead to gradually decayed amplitude of mCherry and
GFP to generate a damped oscillation (Fig.6f). Furthermore, color
proﬁles with multiple visual gradients were observed inE. coli cells
carrying the synthetic oscillatory networks (Supplementary Fig. 19),
indicating the effectiveness and diverse responsive features of these
oscillatory circuits.
To directly evaluate the effect of oscillation system, intracellular
AcP concentration and transcriptional level ofpta and xfspk genes
were determined in the strain Q4602 carrying SCTPK and Oscillator
III. As shown in Fig.6g, the AcP levelﬂuctuated around 2 mM/OD,
which was much lower than that in the strain Q4531 carrying SCTPK
alone. Furthermore, decrease of the AcP concentration also brought
the protein acetylation back to the level similar to that of the wild-
type strain (Fig.6h), avoiding possible unfavorable regulatory effects
caused by AcP accumulation. In addition, the genespta and xfspk
were transcribed oscillatory in opposite phases, and the mRNA level
of pta changed synchronously with intracellular AcP concentra-
tion (Fig.6i).
Besides the periodic oscillation over time, our oscillator could
also enable spatial patterning. As shown in Fig.6j, the strain Q4602
carrying SCTPK and Oscillator III was spread homogeneously onto an
agar plate, and a central source of AcP was added to form a radial
gradient. By expressing differentﬂuorescence protein, the isogenic
bacterial population interpreted the AcP gradient into two discrete
color zones: red and green, just like the Bangladeshﬂag. In contrast, a
bacterial population carrying unregulatedgfp and mCherrygenes only
presented a uniform yellow in spite of the AcP gradient.
Overall, ﬁve oscillating devices were constructed through the
integration of transcriptional regulation and engineered metabolism,
which could be classiﬁed into three categories: unsustained, sustained,
and damped oscillation. The constructed oscillatory network is cap-
able of regulating expression of metabolic genes precisely, sponta-
neously, and real-time to maintain the homeostasis of AcP inE.
coli cells.
Application of AcP-centered oscillation system in biosynthesis
The ultimate goal of constructing artiﬁcial network including SCTPK
and oscillators is to improve the carbon atom economy during bio-
synthesis of chemicals and materials. In this network, the SCTPK is the
“AcP generation” part, channeling more carbon atoms to central

type E. coli BW25113, Q3952, and Q4531. The strains with dynamic
switch model expressedxfspkgene constitutively, and transcription of
other genes was activated by AcP sensors AI and AV. In contrast, these
genes were subjected to automatic dynamic activation or repression
using the oscillators I-IV in other strains (Supplementary Fig. 21). In
shaking ﬂask cultivation, the integration of SCTPK and oscillators
slightly slowed down the growth and reduced theﬁnal cell density
(Fig. 7c), whereas signiﬁcantly enhanced the 3HP production and yield
(Fig. 7d). The strain Q4607 (BW25113 carrying 3HP pathway) accumu-
lated 0.93 g/L 3HP with a yield of 0.09 g/g glucose after 72-h cultiva-
tion, deletion of genes in the strain Q4634 (Q3952 carrying 3HP
pathway) slightly enhanced the 3HP production, while integration of
SCTPK increased the 3HP titer and yield to 1.75 g/L and 0.23 g/g glu-
cose, respectively. Following, the AcP-dependent dynamic switch and
oscillators further improved the bioproduction of 3HP. Finally, the
strain Q4617 harboring SCTPK and oscillator IV presented the highest
3HP titer of 7.60 g/L and yield of 0.71 g/g glucose, which were both
more than 8 times higher than those of the original strain Q4607
(Fig. 7d). Meanwhile, the strain Q4607 accumulated a considerable
amount of acetate and lactate, 4.67 g/L and 3.07 g/L respectively, and
only 0.33 g/L acetate was detected in culture of strain Q4617 (Fig.7e)
probably due to the decreased intracellular pyruvate level. This result
suggested that the SCTPK and oscillator improved the carbon atom
economy during 3HP fermentation in two ways, enhancement of
acetyl-CoA yield from glucose and inhibition of by-products synthesis.
Furthermore, fed-batch fermentation was carried out in a 5-L
bioreactor using the strain Q4617. During fermentation, transcription
of pta and xfspk ﬂuctuated periodically in response to the intracellular
AcP concentration (Fig.7g, h), suggesting that our oscillator system
has high robustness even in a larger scale cultivation and is able to
sense AcP and regulate expression of metabolic genes precisely and
persistently. It was also determined that the aeration ratio played an
important role in 3HP production (Supplementary Fig. 22). Under
optimized conditions, our recombinant strain Q4617 produced
73.42 g/L 3HP with a yield of 0.51 g/g glucose after 108-h fermentation
(Fig. 7f). To the best of our knowledge, this is the highest 3HP pro-
duction reported via the malonyl-CoA pathway in engineered
microbes.
MVA is a valuable precursor for terpenoid biosynthesis, and
PHB is a biodegradable and biocompatible thermoplastic. Subse-
quently, the synthetic genes of MVA and PHB were assembled into
E. colirecombinant strains with three different regulation models,
respectively (Supplementary Figs. 23 and 24), and fermentation in
shaking ﬂask and 5-L bioreactor was performed (Fig.7i, j and Sup-
plementary Figs. 25 and 26). Similar with 3HP, reconﬁguration of
central metabolism to the SCTPK increased MVA production from
0.78 g/L to 1.25 g/L and PHB production from 0.42 g/L to 1.00 g/L,
and the yields of MVA and PHB from glucose were increased by
1.29- and 1.06-fold, respectively. When the AcP-dependent dynamic
switch and oscillators were assembled, the bioproduction of MVA
and PHB were further improved. The strain Q4624 presented the
highest MVA titer, 4.67 g/L which was 5.99 times higher than that of
the original strain Q4618, and the MVA yield was 0.61 g/g glucose,
reaching 95% of the theoretical yield of MVA using SCTPK (0.64 g/
g) and exceeding its native theoretical yield (0.54 g/g). The best
strain for PHB production was Q4632 which accumulated 3.31 g/L
PHB, and its conversion efﬁciency of glucose to PHB has attained
0.41 g/g, reaching 85% and 71% of its native theoretical yield
(0.48 g/g) and theoretical yield using SCTPK (0.58 g/g) respec-
tively. In addition, excretion of byproducts acetate and lactate was
suppressed during the fermentation of MVA and PHB (Supple-
mentary Fig. 25c, d). All these results demonstrated that we have
developed a universal E. coli platform to produce acetyl-CoA
derived chemicals and materials with high carbon atom economy.
Discussion
In this study, a universal synthetic machinery with high carbon atom
economy was constructed. Firstly, the carbon conserving pathway
SCTPK, converting glucose into stoichiometric amounts of AcP with-
out carbon loss, was established relying on the introduction of tri-
functional phosphoketolase and SBPase (Fig.1). Secondly, oscillatory
systems were developed using genetic circuits with various responsive
properties to AcP, maintaining intracellular AcP homeostasis and bal-
ancing the cellular resources between cell growth and the synthesis of
target chemicals. Finally, biosynthesis of several chemicals was carried
out using this synthetic machinery, representing much higher pro-
duction and yield of each product when compared with natural central
metabolism ofE. coli or ﬂux regulation modes including commonly
used static control and dynamic switch. Our results demonstrate that
the combination of construction of carbon conserving pathway and
dynamic oscillatory regulation in response to a key metabolite pro-
vides an attractive strategy for improving the performance of micro-
bial cell factories.
For heterotrophic microorganism, carbon yield is one of the most
important parameters for evaluating their industrial biomanufacturing
performance
42. A typical bioproduction system loses more than 30% of
carbon during the production process. There are two main approaches
to raise the upper bound of carbon yield. One is to employ carbox-
ylation reactions toﬁxC O
2, like the succinate biosynthetic pathway in
which succinate was derived from acetyl-CoA with two CO2 ﬁxation
reactions43, but this only works with speciﬁcm e t a b o l i cp a t h w a y s .T h e
other approach is to avoid decarboxylation, as NOG does in bypassing
pyruvate decarboxylation to eventually generate acetyl-CoA

polymers.

strated to be efﬁcient and manipulatable inE. coli.T h i st r i f u n c t i o n a l

holistically using the pull-push-promote strategy. Speciﬁcally, irrever-
sible reactions catalyzed by Xfspk and SBPase provide driving force
and push carbonﬂux into this carbon conserving cycle (Fig.2a). Sec-
ondly, expression of genexfspk encoding rate-limiting enzyme was
strengthened by placing this gene on a high copy number plasmid, to
promote synthesis of AcP from S7P, F6P and X5P. Thirdly, genes
involved in production of acetate, lactate, ethanol and formate were
knocked out to eliminate carbon loss as a way to pull byproduct
carbon into the target pathway, and expression of PfkA, GapA, and
GapB proteins that may shunt the SCTPK was repressed hierarchically
by combinational asRNA arrays to further improve the function of
SCTPK (Figs. 2aa n d3a). This engineering strategy has achieved
excellent results: the resultant strain Q4531 presented an intracellular
AcP concentration of 5.73 mM/OD, 2.83 times higher than that ofE. coli
BW25113 wild-type strain (Fig.3f), and the maximum CO

alternating cellular states presented by AcP-response oscillators. This metabolator
consists of a network with pools of two metabolite AcP and acetyl-CoA produced by
enzymes Xfspk and Pta, whose expressions are negatively and positively regulated
by AcP, respectively. In State A where the AcP is low, Xfspk is expressed alongwith
GFP. The accumulation of AcP represses Xfspk and upregulates Pta and mCherry,
generating acetyl-CoA from AcP. With the decrease of AcP level and increase of

BW25113 strain (Fig.3h). When coupled with MVA biosynthetic path-
way and AcP-responsive oscillator, the MVA yield from glucose
reached 0.61 g/g, exceeding the native MVA theoretical yield of 0.54 g/
g( F i g .7i). All these results demonstrated that SCTPK did enhance the
carbon atom economy during bioconversion process, and it could be
adopted as a new carbon sequestration platform to produce more
critical or value-added chemicals.
However, there is still an issue, that is, the SCTPK alone does not
generate ATP and reducing power (Fig.2a), which are required for cell
growth and production of chemicals such as 3HP, MVA and PHB. In our
strains, E. colinative pathways for glucose catabolism including gly-
colysis, Entner-Doudoroff pahway and residual upper section of
phosphate pentose pathway, are still functional, and can produce
energy and reducing equivalents. Furthermore, cells can generate ATP
and NAD(P)H via the TCA cycle and respiration. Therefore, we believe
that ATP and reducing power required for cell growth and biosynthesis
are supplied byE. colinative pathways, and main role of SCTPK is to
produce AcP from glucose without CO
2 release to improve the pro-
duction and yield of acetyl-CoA-derived chemicals. This situation is
similar to recombinant strain carrying NOG reported previously
44.
Currently, there are several hybrid routes being established by simul-
taneous overexpression of NOG and basal central metabolism
45–47.
These strategies essentially replenish energy with carbon atom, and
this stitching practice results in a theoretical carbon yield of 61.1-
83.3%
48. Now electrical power can be produced in sustainable ways,
and can be used to supply reducing equivalent and energy in microbial
electrosynthesis system
49. Application of electrical driven generation
of ATP and reducing equivalent in carbon conserving platform strains
is believed to be an effective solution.
In this study, we designed and constructed several oscillator
systems that response to AcP spontaneously. They sense the balance
between two inter-converting metabolite pools (AcP and acetyl-CoA)
produced by two enzymes Xfspk and Pta, whose expressions are
negatively and positively regulated by AcP, respectively (Fig. 5).
Compared with the previously constructed NRI-dependent AcP
sensors
22,23, our genetic circuits were optimized by adjusting the afﬁ-
nity of activator NRI or repressor PhlF to corresponding promoters,
resulting in more diverse oscillator systems with longer duration which
have a wide range of applications in biosynthesis of various chemicals
and materials. For example, the highest productions of MVA and PHB
were achieved with the usage of Oscillator III while 3HP with Oscillator
IV (Fig.7d, i, j). In strains carrying the sustained oscillators, periodic
ﬂuctuations of intracellular AcP concentration and gene expression
level were observed in both shakingﬂask cultivation and fed-batch

ness and scalability of these oscillation systems. The metabolic net-
works of microbials are highly regulated and respond to
environmental conditions. This adaptability may beneﬁt cell survival
and growth, while it often causes inconsistent fermentation perfor-

believed that these oscillation systems, which makes biological pro-
cess more predictable and repeatable, have potential to simplify the
optimization and scale up of bioproduction of other valuable
chemicals.
Oscillatory regulation of carbonﬂux signiﬁcantly improved the
production and yield of target chemicals and materials in our study. In
metabolic engineering, there are several strategies to modulate the
metabolic ﬂux. For example, static regulation means are easy to
operate and have short cycle time, such as overexpression and
knockout of genes, modiﬁcations of RBS sites, optimization of plasmid
copy number. Nevertheless, these approaches usually bring issues like
intermediate metabolite accumulation and carbon source waste
9,51.
Dynamic switch alleviates the effect of exogenous pathway introduc-
tion on the uneven distribution of resources within the cell. However,
when there is excessive accumulation or consumption of a key intra-
cellular component or compound, it would affect the global metabo-
lism of the cell
9,51,52. Here oscillatory model based on sophisticated
sensing of key metabolite AcP, the immediate product of the SCTPK
and precursor of acetyl-CoA and biosynthesis, provides an alternative
in the face of the above problem. Our oscillators can balance theﬂux of
AcP producing and consuming routes autonomously, maintain the
intracellular AcP homeostasis (Figs.6ga n d7g), and avoid excessive
protein acetylation (Fig.6h), resulting in incrasing of carbon yield in
bioproduction. Compared withE. coli strains with statically reconﬁ-
gured central metabolism network, utilization of the AcP-centered
oscillators improved the productions of 3HP, MVA, and PHB by 4.3, 3.7,
and 3.3 times, respectively, in shakingﬂask cultivation (Fig.7d, i, j). In
fed-batch fermentation, 3HP was accumulated up to 73.42 g/L with a
yield of 0.51 g/g glucose (Fig.7f), representing the highest 3HP pro-
duction and yield reported via the malonyl-CoA pathway.
Methods
Strains and plasmids
All plasmids and strains used in this study are listed in Supplementary
Data 2 and 3, respectively. The primers and the sequences of genetic
parts used in this study are listed in Supplementary Data 4 and 5,
respectively.E. colistrain DH5α was used for plasmid construction.E.
coli BL21(DE3) and plasmid pET28a were used for overexpression of
FbaA, Xfspk and SBPases from six different strains, which were further
used for protein puriﬁcation. E. coliBW25113 was used as the host for
SCTPK construction, optimization, and application. Two artiﬁcially
constructed plasmids based on pETDuet-1 and pRSFDuet-1 were used
to express related enzymes in the product synthesis pathway. Speci-
ﬁcally, pETD was used for combinatorial expression of Xfspk and
asRNA arrays, while pRSF was used for combinatorial expression of
PTA and enzymes downstream of speciﬁc pathway (MvaE and MvaS for
mevalonate
53; AccADBC, MCR-N and MCR-C for 3HP7; PhaC, PhaA and
PhaB for PHB54; sequences shown in Supplementary Data 6). All con-
structs used for tools development and application were generated
using standard restriction cloning with enzymes from Takara Bio
(Dalian, China) or ClonExpress MultiS One Step Cloning Kit procedure
from Vazyme Biotech (Nanjing, China). PCR puriﬁcation and miniprep
kits (Omega, USA) were used for DNA extraction following the manu-
facturer’s protocols. Competent cells were prepared by Ultra-
Competent Cell Preps Kit (Sangon Biotech, China). Primers were pur-
chased from a commercial synthesis service (Tsingke, China). All
constructed plasmids were con ﬁrmed by DNA sequencing
(Tsingke, China).
For the construction of SCTPK, rock-paper-scissors based
CRISPR/Cas9 strategy was used to edit the chromosome, including
deleting or replacing genetic sequences genes inE. coli
55.G e n e sidhA,
adhE, pﬂB, poxB, aceE, tktAB, talAB were knocked out. The genes for
encoding SBPases from different strains (Bacillus methanolicus, Sac-
charomyces cerevisiaeCEN.PK, Serratia marcescens, SynechocystisPCC
6803, Thermosynechococcus elongatus) and Xfspk fromBiﬁdobacter-
ium longumNCC2705 were synthesized with codon optimization forE.
coli (Supplementary Data 7) by BGI Biotechnology and GenScript
Biotech Corporation. The SBPase fromSynechocystis PCC 6803 was
integrated into the genome with a constitutive promoter Pj23119 and
B0034 RBS via CRISPR/Cas9. All the spacers were designed by
sgRNAcas9 V3.0
56. The following concentrations of antibiotics were
used: spectinomycin 100 µg/mL, apramycin 100 µg/mL, chlor-
amphenicol 33µg/mL and tetracycline 17µg/mL, kanamycin 50µg/mL
and ampicillin 100µg/mL. To silence genespfkA, gapA,a n dgapB,d i f -
ferent promoters (Pj23116,P j23118,P j23119) and target sequence lengths (0,
50, 80, 100, 150, 200 nt) were selected to verify the effect of asRNA
repression. asRNA arrays are assembled through Golden Gate. The
mutated glnAp2 promoter containing different enhancers or gover-
nors were produced by the one-step site-directed plasmid mutagen-
esis. Brieﬂy, mutagenesis was generated by inverse PCR of the plasmid
using the corresponding primers, and the PCR product digested by
DpnI (New England Biolabs, USA) was transformed intoE. coliDH5α.
Colonies with related mutations were veriﬁed by PCR and conﬁrmed
by DNA sequencing. To construct a negative feedback circuit, the PhlF
repressor induced by promoter Pg was introduced into the genome
together with a weak B0031 RBSvia CRISPR/Cas9.
Culture conditions
Luria-Bertani (LB) medium was used for plasmids and strains con-
struction. To test whether SCTPK is functional in vivo, LB medium and
modiﬁed M9 minimal medium were used, which contains 15.11 g/L
Na
2HPO4·12H2O, 3.0 g/L KH2PO4, 1.0 g/L NH4Cl, 0.5 g/L NaCl, 20 g/L
glucose, 1 g/L yeast extract, 0.1 mM CaCl2,1m MM g S O4,0 . 1m MF e C l3,
and 10 mL of trace element solution (0.18 g/L ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.12 g/L
MnSO4·H2O, 0.18 g/L CoCl2·6H2O, 0.12 g/L CuCl2·2H2O).
For production of MVA and PHB, the fermentation medium con-
tains 9.8 g/L K2HPO4·3H2O, 2.1 g/L citrate hydrate, 0.3 g/L ammonium
ferric citrate, 0.25 g/L MgSO4·7H2O, 5 g/L beef extract, 2% glucose and
1 mL of trace element solution (0.29 g/L ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.37 g/L
(NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O, 0.25 g/L CuSO4·5H2O, 1.58 g/L MnCl2·4H2Oa n d
2.47 g/L H3BO4). For production of 3HP, the modiﬁed minimal medium
contains 14 g/L K2HPO4·3H2O, 5.2 g/L KH2PO4, 1 g/L NaCl, 1 g/L NH4Cl,
0.25 g/L MgSO4·7H2O, 5 g/L yeast extract and 2% glucose. Shakingﬂask
experiments were carried out in triplicate in 250 mLﬂasks containing
50 mL medium. To exclude effect of beef extract or yeast extract on
production of target chemicals, control experiments were performed
using above medium without glucose. The production of 3HP, MVA
and PHB was lower than 80 mg/L (Supplementary Fig. 27), indicating
that beef extract or yeast extract only had a growth boosting effect, but
cannot be used to produce target chemicals. So, yield of target che-
mical was calculated as the following equation:
Yield = produced chemicalðgÞ=consumed glucoseðgÞð 1Þ
Fermentation was carried out in a 5-L bioreactor containing 2 L
medium. The culture temperature was controlled at 37 °C, the pH was
maintained at 7.0, the dissolved oxygen (DO) was kept above 40%
saturation via cascade agitation (400–700 rpm), and no chemical
inducer was needed. After the initial carbon sources were nearly
exhausted, fed-batch mode was commenced by feeding a solution
containing 50% (w/v) glucose. Samples were taken as required and
analyzed.

Analytical methods
Cell growth was assayed by measuring optical density (OD) of the
culture at 600 nm using a spectrophotometer (U-2900; Hitachi). The
residual glucose concentration was detected by an SBA-40ES biologi-
cal sensing analyzer (Institute of Biology, Shandong Academy of sci-
ences, China). Pyruvate, acetate, lactate, MVA, 3HP were determined
using an Agilent 1260 Inﬁnity series HPLC system equipped with an
HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA) (300 × 7.8 mm) at 40 °C with
5 mmol/L sulfuric acid as the mobile phase. All culture samples were
centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for 10 min and thenﬁltered through a
0.22μm ﬁlter before analysis.
To determine the AcP content, single colonies harboring the
corresponding plasmids were grown overnight in LB medium at 37 °C.
Then, the cells were washed, resuspended into fresh M9 medium
containing 2% glucose at an initial OD
600 of 0.02, and grown at 37 °C
with shaking. When reaching stationary phase, the cells were washed
twice with phosphate buffered saline (PBS, 10 mM, pH7.2–7.4) and
disrupted using a high-pressure cell disruptor (Constant Systems LTD,
UK). The AcP assay was derived from previous study with minor
modiﬁcations
12,47.S p e c iﬁcally, 500μl of sample was added to 250µLo f
hydroxylamine reagent (4 M hydroxylamine hydrochloride: 3.5 M
sodium hydroxide = 1:1, v/v), and kept at room temperature for 10 min
to form hydroxamate. Then the coloring reagent, 750μL ferric chlor-
ide solution (5% ferric chloride: 12% trichloroacetic acid: 3 M HCl = 1:1:1,
v/v/v), was added and kept at room temperature for 5 min, and the
absorbance at 540 nm was measured using a microplate reader (Spark,
Tecan). PHB was measured using previously reported methods with
slight modiﬁcation
57. Brieﬂy, cells were separated from the fermenta-
tion broth by centrifugation at 12,000 ×g and 4 °C for 10 min. Cell
pellets were washed twice with distilled water and lyophilized, treated
with twenty milliliter of 0.05 M NaOH solution for 3 h and then cen-
trifuged at 15,000 ×g for 20 min. The pellet was washed twice with
icecold ethanol (95%, analytical grade), and subjected to freeze drying
for further analysis.
To detect the release of CO
2, a gas analysis system (BCP- CO2,
BlueSens, Germany) was used to record and analyze in situ the real-time
changes of CO
2 in the shakeﬂask during the incubation. Cultures were

volume every 1 min and transmits the information to a computer.
Protein puriﬁcation, SDS-PAGE and western blotting
The E. coli cells were collected and washed twice with phosphate
buffered saline (PBS, 0.01 M, pH 7.2–7.4) and disrupted using a high-
pressure cell disruptor (Constant Systems LTD, UK). The his6-tagged
recombinant protein was puriﬁed using Ni-NTA His·Bind Column
(Novagen). The protein was quantiﬁed using a Bradford protein assay
kit (Beyotime, China), fractionated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel and visua-
lized by Coomassie blue staining. For western blot, proteins were
transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore) and blocked using quick
block western reagent (Beyotime, China). HRP Anti-6X His tag anti-
body [GT359] (Abcam, catalog No. ab184607, 1:10,000) was used to
detect His
6-tagged proteins, and acetyl lysine mouse monoclonal
antibody (EasyBio, China, catalog No. BE3411, 1:2000) and Goat anti-
mouse IgG (H&L) HRP-conjugated antibody (EasyBio, China, catalog
No. BE0102, 1:10,000) was used for protein acetylation analysis. Then
protein signal was detected using Immobilon Western HRP substrate
(Millipore) and Fusion FX6 Imaging System (Vilber, France).
Enzyme activity assay
The puriﬁed protein was desalted using NAP-10 column (GE Healthcare
Life Sciences, Pittsburgh, USA). SBP/FBPase activity was determined as
following58: the reaction mixture containing 50 mM Tris/HCl, pH 8.0,
15 mM MgCl2,1 0m MD T T ,1 0m ME 4 P ,1 0m MD H A Pa n dp u r iﬁed FbaA
and SBP/FBPase was incubated at 37 °C for 30 min, and the reaction was
stopped by addition of 0.2 M perchloric acid. Then the samples were
centrifuged and the supernatant was subjected to phosphate quantiﬁ-
cation. Aliquots (20μL) of the sample and standards (0-0.5 mM KH
2PO4)
were incubated with 340μL molybdate solution (0.3% ammonium
molybdate in 0.55 M H2SO4) for 10 min at room temperature. Sixty
microliters of malachite green solution (0.035% malachite green, 0.35%
polyvinyl alcohol) was added and the samples were incubated for fur-
ther 45 min. The absorbance at 620 nm was determined using a multi-
mode microplate reader (Spark, Tecan). The reaction catalyzed by
phosphoketolase took place for 30 min in buffer containing 50 mM Tris/
HCl (pH 8.0), 15 mM MgCl
2,1 0m MD T T ,5m MK C l ,2 0m Mp o t a s s i u m
phosphate, 1 mM thiamine pyrophosphate, 0.25μM phosphoketolase
and 10 mM substrate. For the S7P phosphoketolase activity, 10 mM
DHAP and E4P were supplemented with 0.25μMo fF b a Aa n dS B P a s e .
For the F6P and X5P phosphoketolase activity, 10 mM F6P and X5P were
used, respectively. The reaction was stopped by adding 25μLo f
hydroxylamine reagent. Afterwards, AcP concentration was measured.
Fluorescence assay
To assay cell growth andﬂuorescence intensity, the corresponding
data were recorded on a multimode microplate reader (Spark, Tecan)
using 96-well black plates. The mTagBFP2 intensity was measured at an
excitation wavelength (EX) of 402 ± 5 nm and an emission wavelength
(EM) of 457 ± 10 nm, the GFP intensity was measured at an EX of
480 ± 5 nm and an EM of 520 ± 10 nm, and the mCherry intensity was
measured at an EX of 588 ± 10 nm and an EM of 645 ± 10 nm. The
background ﬂuorescence of the strain withoutﬂuorescent protein
expression (FL
bg) and the background OD of the medium (ODbg)w e r e
measured, and the relativeﬂuorescence intensities was calculated as
the following equation:
ðFL=ODÞcorrected = ðFL /C0 FLbg Þ=ðOD /C0 ODbg Þ ð2Þ
For the ﬂuorescence microscopy, Laser Scanning Confocal
Microscope LSM900 (ZEISS, Germany) was used, and Fiji (NIH) was
used to merge the images of the channels. To detect spatial patterning,
strain Q4602 was spread onto LB agar plate, and sterilizedﬁlter paper
disk was placed at the center of the plate and AcP solution was deliv-
ered to the disk. After grown overnight at 37 °C, theﬂuorescence was
visualized using a LED transilluminator (BL-20, LABGIC).
Real-time PCR
Total RNA was isolated using the EASYSpin Plus Bacterial RNA kit
(Aidlab Biotechnologies, China), and measured using a Nanodrop one
C
spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA).
Genomic DNA was removed and cDNA was obtained by using the Evo
M-MLV RT Kit with gDNA Clean for qPRC II (Accurate Biology, China).
Quantitative PCR was performed using SYBR Green Pro Taq HS qPCR
Kit (Accurate Biology, China) with the QuantStudio 1 system (Applied
Biosystems). The constitutively transcribed generpoD was used as a
reference control to normalize total RNA quantity of different samples.
The relative amount of mRNA level was calculated using the 2
−ΔΔCt
method. Three independent biological samples with two technical
repeats for each sample were performed.
Software and statistics
Software for initial data processing was Microsoft Excel 2019, and
subsequent analyses and plotting were carried out using OriginPro
2022 (OriginLab) and Graphpad Prism 9 (Graphpad). The spacers of
gRNA were designed by sgRNAcas9 v3.0. Theﬂuorescence intensities
were determined by using magellan 3.0 (Tecan). The imaging data
were obtained and processed by Zen 3.3 (Zeiss) and Fiji (NIH). The
relevant curves wereﬁtted using OriginPro 2022 (OriginLab). The
logistic model was used to calculate the speciﬁc growth rate. Two-
tailed Student’s t-tests were performed to determine the statistical
signiﬁcance.
