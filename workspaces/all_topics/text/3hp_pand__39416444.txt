ABSTRACT  
To improve the production of 3-HP with glucose as a substrate, the malonyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA pathways 
were coupled to regulate NADP
+
/NADPH regeneration in the recombinant E. coli . The strain Ec -AM that over -
expressed the key enzymes of the malonyl-CoA pathway, acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) from Ustilago maydis and 
malonyl CoA reductase (MCR) from Chloroflexus aurantiacus , produced 0.26 g/L of 3-HP in 25-h shake flask 
cultivation. The strain Ec -P overexpressing the key enzyme of the propionyl-CoA pathway, propionyl-CoA de -
hydrogenase (PACD) from Candida rugosa , produced 0.11 g/L of 3-HP. However, 3-HP titer of the strain Ec -PAM 
overexpressing PACD along with ACC and MCR, via two pathways cooperation, was 1.29 g/L. The addition of 
biotin and bicarbonate improved the 3-HP production of the strain Ec -PAM. 3-HP titer of strain Ec - Δ Y- Δ P-PAM 
with double deletion of ygfH (encoding propionyl-CoA: succinate-CoA transferase) and prpC (encoding methyl -
citrate synthase) genes reached 1.94 g/L, which was 1.5-fold higher than that of the strain Ec -PAM cultured 
under the same conditions.   
1. Introduction 
In recent years, with the growing scarceness of non-renewable re -
sources such as oil, researches around the world had turned their 
attention to production of renewable resources by biological methods. 
At the moment, 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) is one of the most 
promising chemical intermediates
1
; it has both, a hydroxyl and a 
carboxyl functional groups, and is the precursor of many important 
chemicals, such as 1,3-propanediol, special polyester and acrylic mate -
rials. 3-HP can also be used for production of water treatment chemicals, 
coatings, adhesives and personal care products.
2 
3-HP can be found in nature as a metabolic intermediate during the 
process of CO
2 
fixation in some bacteria.
3 
It can also be accumulated as 
an end product from glycerol, glucose, propionic acid, xylose, acrylic 
acid or acetate.
4 – 10 
3-HP exists as an intermediate metabolite in certain 
metabolic pathways, but in general, is not essential for microbial 
growth, so it cannot be highly accumulated by the cell. If there is 
excessive accumulation of 3-HP, it will destroy the metabolic balance of 
microbial cells.
11 
In order to improve the strains for 3-HP accumulation 
it is required to develop specially designed recombinant strains. 
In recent years, different routes for production of 3-HP had been 
proposed.
6 , 12 
Among them, glycerol, malonyl-CoA and beta-alanine 
pathway are widely studied, and glycerol and glucose are the two 
main substrates for the synthesis of 3-HP.
13 , 14 
Mutants of Candida rugosa 
could produce 40.2 g/l of 3-HP from propionate,
9 
which makes it of 
great research value to produce 3-HP through the propionyl-CoA 
pathway in recombinant E. coli .
15 
3-HP production via the 
propionyl-CoA pathway requires few enzymes to produce 3-HP. Among 
them, propionyl-CoA dehydrogenase (PACD, EC:1.3.8.7)
9,16 
is the 
essential enzyme for this pathway , which converts propionyl-CoA into 
acryloyl-CoA and simultaneously consumes one mol of NADP
+
to 
generate one mol of NADPH. Besides, propionate CoA-transferase (PCT, 
EC:2.8.3.1) and 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase (HPCD, 
EC:4.2.1.17) are necessary for the pathway, but E. coli possesses

endogenous genes encoding PrpE (propionyl-CoA synthetase) and 
enoyl-CoA hydratase, which are functionally similar to PCT and HPCD, 
respectively ( Fig. 1 ).
15 
Therefore, introducing PACD alone is enough to 
establish the propionyl-CoA pathway in E. coli . In addition, the deletion 
of ygfH gene (encoding propionyl-CoA: succinate CoA-transferase) and 
prpC gene (encoding methylcitrate synthase) in the competitive path -
ways led in the increase of 3-HP titer.
15 
The malonyl-CoA pathway is one of the most promising methods to 
produce 3-HP from glucose
17 – 22 
( Fig. 1 ). Carboxylation of acetyl-CoA 
into malonyl-CoA occurs in the presence of acetyl-CoA carboxylase 
(ACC), and then malonyl-CoA reductase (MCR) uses malonyl-CoA as a 
substrate to form 3-HP.
22 
In malonyl-CoA pathway, the cofactor NADPH 
is necessary for the reduction of malonyl-CoA and its regeneration may 
be a limiting factor of this pathway.
23 
Interestingly, for the 
propionyl-CoA pathway, NADPH is a byproduct in the oxidation of 
propionyl-CoA to produce acryloyl-CoA.
15 
Thus, the combination of 
these two pathways into a recombinant strain would be promising for 
the increment of 3-HP titer due to the in vivo regeneration of NADPH 
( Fig. 1 ). 
In this work, the genes PACD along with ACC and MCR were ob -
tained from different bacterial species, and the recombinant strains 
containing the single or combining pathways of the propionyl-CoA 
pathway and the malonyl CoA pathway for 3-HP production were con -
structed. The comparisons of these recombinant strains in the produc -
tion of 3-HP were investigated. The effects of biotin and sodium 
bicarbonate on 3-HP accumulation were also discussed. In order to 
further improve 3-HP titer of the recombinant strains, the genes of 
competitive pathways were deleted to increase the propionyl-CoA pool 
in the strain, and 3-HP accumulation of the resultant strains was 
investigated.

3 ’ . The PCR products were digested with Bam H1 and Hin d III and then 
ligated to the pET-28a vector. The obtained plasmid pET-MCR was 
further digested by Xba I and Hin d III, and the mcr gene was then 
subcloned into pBAD18 vector to construct the recombinant plasmid 
pBAD18-MCR. The gene sequences of pacd, acc and mcr could be found 
in Supplementary Information. 
The plasmids pCS11, pBAD18-MCR and pACYCDuet-PACD were 
transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) individually or in combination to 
create the 3 strains used in this study: Ec -AM (pCS11, pBAD18-MCR), Ec - 
P (pACYCDuet-PACD) and Ec -PAM (pACYCDuet-PACD, pCS11, 
pBAD18-MCR), for protein expression and 3-HP production assessment. 
The plasmids pACYCDuet-PACD, pCS11 and pBAD18-MCR were also the 
transformed into three gene-deleted host cells ( Ec- Δ Y , Ec- Δ P and Ec- Δ Y- 
Δ P , which were constructed in our previous work
15
) to construct the 
recombinant strains Ec- Δ Y- PAM, Ec- Δ P -PAM and Ec- Δ Y- Δ P -PAM. 
2.3. Protein expression and gel electrophoresis 
To verify that the process of modification of the strain was successful, 
the strain Ec -PAM was cultivated in LB medium and induced at 25 
◦
C, 
30

C and 37 
◦
C with 100 μ M IPTG at 0.6 OD

. The cells were har -
vested after 12 h induction, and centrifuged at 10,000 g at 4 
◦
C for 15 
min. The cell pellets were washed twice and then re-suspended in 100 
mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The cells were lysed and then 
centrifuged at 10,000 g for 20 min. The supernatants were used for SDS- 
PAGE which examined protein expression.
24 
2.4. Cultivation of recombinant E. coli strains 
Unless indicated otherwise, shake flask cultivation was carried out 
with a 20 mL working volume in 100 ml Erlenmeyer flasks at 37 
◦
C in an 
incubator shaker at 200 rpm. The following medium was used in this 
study: peptone 1%, yeast extract 0.5%, NaCl 1%, pH 7.0. And Cm at 25 
mg/L was added to the strain Ec -P. For E c-AM, Kan and Amp at 50 mg/L, 
were added in the medium. And for Ec- PAM, Kan, Amp and Cm at 50 
mg/L, 50 mg/L, and 25 mg/L, respectively, were added to the medium. 
The recombinant strains were cultured in the above mediums and 
induced at 0.6 OD
600 
with 100 μ M IPTG. For E c-AM and Ec- PAM, in 
addition to 100 μ M IPTG, 6.7 mM arabinose was added. After 12 h in -
duction, 0.1% propionate and 0.4% glucose were added to the culture 
broth of E c-P and Ec- PAM and the culture temperature was raised to 
37 
◦
C. Since the cultivation was carried out in shake flask and the pH was 
not controlled, thus low-concentration carbon sources were added to the 
medium to prevent a drastic drop of pH value during the cultivation. 
Each sample was withdrawn periodically to determine the concentra -
tions of 3-HP during a period of 25 h. For the gene deletion strains Ec- Δ Y- 
PAM, Ec- Δ P -PAM and Ec- Δ Y- Δ P -PAM, the same culture condition as Ec- 
PAM were adopted. The yield (g/g) was calculated by dividing the 
produced 3-HP by the total carbon source (propionic acid and glucose). 
To investigate the impact of biotin or sodium bicarbonate on 3-HP 
production, the recombinant strain Ec -PAM was cultured and induced 
in LB medium containing antibiotics Kan, Amp and Cm at 25 
◦
C for 12 h. 
Then, 0.1% propionate and 0.4% glucose were added to the culture 
broth. At the same time biotin was added at different final concentra -
tions 0 mg/L, 5 mg/L, 10 mg/L, 15 mg/L, 20 mg/L, 25 mg/L, 30 mg/L 
and cultured at 37 
◦
C. While for sodium bicarbonate optimization, after 
the induction of Ec -PAM, sodium bicarbonate was added at the con -
centration of 0 g/L, 0.5 g/L, 1 g/L, 1.5 g/L, 2 g/L, 2.5 g/L. Each sample 
was periodically taken to analyze the final concentration of 3-HP by 
HPLC. 
2.5. Analytical methods 
The concentrations of 3-HP and the by-products were assayed by 
HPLC. Supernatants, obtained by centrifugation of culture samples at 
10,000 g for 10 min, were filtered through 0.22 μ m filter and isocrati -
cally eluted through a Venusil MP C18 column (4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 μ m 
particle size, Agela Technologies Inc.) with methanol-10 mM H

(5:95, v/v) as the mobile phase. The flow rate and the detection wave -
length were selected at 1 ml/min and UV 208 nm, respectively. The 
samples were assayed for three times and the standard deviation of the 
measurements was less than 5% for 3-HP. 
3. Results and discussion 
3.1. Expression of ACC, MCR and PACD in recombinant E. coli 
In order to enhance the production of 3-hydroxypropionic acid, three 
genes (ACC, MCR and PACD) were overexpressed in E. coli . For this 
purpose, three strains with different 3-HP synthetic pathways were 
studied. (i) Strain Ec- P produced 3-HP via the propionyl-CoA pathway 
by overexpressing PACD from C. rugose . (ii) Strain Ec- AM produced 3-HP 
via the malonyl-CoA pathway involving two enzymes: ACC from 
U. maydis and MCR from C. aurantiacus . (iii) To investigate the effect of 
the overexpression of these three genes (PACD, ACC, MCR) on the 
production of 3-HP, a strain Ec- PAM coupling the propionyl-CoA 
pathway and the malonyl-CoA pathway was engineered. 
The expression of the strain Ec -PAM with IPTG induction was carried 
out at 25 
◦
C, 30 
◦
C and 37 
◦
C respectively, and the enzyme expression 
was assessed by SDS-PAGE. Fig. 2 shows the expression profile for the 
recombinant enzymes. The extract of Ec -PAM showed the presence of 
the ACC enzyme with a molecular weight of 225 kDa, MCR with a 
molecular weight of 145 kDa and PACD with a molecular weight of 49 
kDa. The soluble expression level of the enzymes was higher at 25 
◦
C 
under shake flask fermentation conditions, suggesting that culture 
temperature of 25 
◦
C was beneficial to the production of 3-HP. 
3.2. Shake flask fermentation of the strains for production of 3-HP 
With the intention to evaluate the production of 3-HP via the 
propionyl-CoA pathway and the malonyl-CoA pathway, the recombi -
nant strains Ec -AM, Ec -P and Ec -PAM were cultured and induced as 
described above. When ACC and MCR were expressed together, after 25 
h of fermentation, the strain Ec -AM produced a 3-HP titer of 0.26 g/L 
( Fig. 3 A). When PACD was expressed alone, the strain Ec -P produced

0.11 g/L 3-HP ( Fig. 3 B). When the 3 genes were expressed together, 3- 
HP titer of Ec -PAM was 1.29 g/L ( Fig. 3 C), which was 4.9-fold and 
11.7-fold higher than that of Ec -AM and Ec -P, respectively. This shows 
that the introduction of the ACC and MCR genes, along with PACD 
expression significantly improved the accumulation of 3-HP in the 
engineered strain. 
When the malonyl-CoA pathway was introduced alone in E. coli , the 
expression of ACC and MCR did not result in a high production of 3-HP 
(0.26 g/L). However, 3-HP titer of 0.26 g/L was still higher than that of 
the recombinant E . coli expressing MCR of C. aurantiacus and ACC of E . 
coli (1.6 mM) in literature,
23 
which might be due to the higher activity of 
ACC from fungus U. maydis than that of the prokaryotic ACC from E . 
coli .
26 
Since most of the acetyl-CoA is metabolized via the tricarboxylic 
acid (TCA) cycle,
23 
the malonyl-CoA pathway is competing with the TCA 
cycle for acetyl-CoA. Thus, a higher activity of ACC is crucial to improve 
the efficiency of the malonyl-CoA pathway. In addition, the reaction 
requires 2 mol of the reduced cofactor NADPH to convert 1 mol 
malonyl-CoA into 3-HP,
6 , 27 
the low production of 3-HP by this strain can 
also be explained as a result of lack of NADPH. 
Another potential pathway for production of 3-HP is the propionyl- 
CoA pathway.
15 
One of the key enzymes of this pathway is 
propionyl-CoA dehydrogenase (PACD), a heterogeneous protein of 
E. coli , which interacts with the endogenous enzymes, PrpE (propio -
nyl-CoA synthetase)
15 , 28 , 29 
and enoyl-CoA hydratase,
6 
to produce 3-HP 
as an end product. In order to reduce the metabolic stress of the re -
combinant strain, we decided to overexpress PACD to interact with the 
native metabolic fluxes for the metabolism of propionyl-CoA. But as it 
was reported previously,
15 
due to the low specific activity of other en -
zymes regarding the propionyl-CoA pathway, Ec -P had a low titer of 
3-HP (0.11 g/L). 
Therefore, we decided to construct a strain that couples the malonyl- 
CoA pathway and the propionyl-CoA pathway. The coupling expression 
of PACD, ACC and MCR positively affected the production of 3-HP. As it 
was previously explained, the intracellular NADPH pool can be a 
limiting factor for the production of 3-HP via the malonyl-CoA pathway. 
The presence of a membrane-bound transhydrogenase catalyzing the 
reversible redox reaction (NADH + NADP
+
+ H 
+
out 
↔ NAD
+
+ NADPH 
+ H
+
in
) in E. coli has been verified long before.
30 , 31 
In a previously 
reported work, a transhydrogenase was introduced into malonyl-CoA 
pathway to converts NADH to NADPH and the titer of 3-HP increased 
from 1.6 mM to 2.14 mM.
23 
On the other hand, the upregulated meta -
bolic flux of propionyl-CoA pathway and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, 
which might result in generation of NADPH in an excess of cellular 
needs. The excess NADPH could be balanced by the conversion of 
NADPH to NADH by the transhydrogenase. These transhydrogenases 
can catalyze the transfer of hydride from NADPH to NAD
+
, and in the 
case of NADPH overproduction, are important to balance the 
NADPH/NADH pool.
32 – 34 
Obviously, the excess NADPH in the 
propionyl-CoA pathway is an indispensable substrate for the 
malonyl-CoA pathway. Thus, the high production of 3-HP by Ec- PAM 
can be the result of a NADP
+
/NADPH redox balance regulated by the 
combination of malonyl-CoA pathway and propionyl-CoA pathway. 
In a previous work, a recombinant strain with a dual synthetic 
pathway (ALDH pathway and Pdu pathway) was constructed for 3-HP 
production with glycerol as carbon source, and the resultant strain 
exhibited a 70% increase in 3-HP titer compared to one harboring the 
ALDH pathway alone. Though two pathways were involved in that 
work, there was no benefit of redox balance for these two pathways.
35 
3.3. Analysis of by-products in the production of 3-HP 
Production of 3-HP by bacterial fermentation can produce some 
kinds of carboxylic acids, for example, lactic acid and acetic acid. In 
order to analyze the effect of these by-products on the production of 3- 
HP, shake-flask fermentation of the strains was conducted and the 
production of some carboxylic acids was evaluated. 
As shown in Table 2 , the relationship between 3-HP and the other by- 
products is negatively correlated, meaning that the lower is the pro -
duction of by-products, the higher will be the production of 3-HP. Acetic 
acid and lactic acid were two main by-products that have attracted much 
attention, and in some literature the gene deletion of pta-ackA (encoding 
phosphotransacetylase and acetate kinase) and ldhA (encoding lactate

As expected, when their concentrations in the broth 
were high, the production of 3-HP was low. Ec- P presented the highest 
levels of by-products. On the other hand, when combined with the 
malonyl-CoA pathway, the production of these by-products decreased 
significantly in the culture broth of Ec- PAM. The highest titer of 3-HP 
with the lowest by-products concentration for Ec- PAM suggested that 
this two-pathway coupling strain had a higher substrate transformation 
efficiency than the single-pathway strains Ec- P and Ec- AM, exhibiting a 
good prospect for the 3-HP fermentation with glucose as carbon source. 
3.4. Optimization of the cultivation conditions 
In the production of 3-HP by malonyl-CoA pathway, there are some 
factors that may have impact on the ACC-catalyzed carboxylation of 
acetyl-CoA to form malonyl-CoA.
21 
Considering ACC is a 
biotin-dependent enzyme, and bicarbonate is necessary for the synthesis 
of malonyl-CoA, we decided to identify the optimal concentration of 
biotin and bicarbonate to improve the 3-HP production of the engi -
neered strain. 
The strain Ec -PAM was cultured with biotin at different concentra -
tions, and the final concentration of 3-HP of each sample was shown in 
Fig. 4 A. In different concentrations of biotin, the 3-HP production had a 
small increasement. When biotin was added at a concentration of 25 
mg/L, 3-HP increased to a titer of 1.41 g/L, indicating that the optimal 
concentration of biotin is 25 mg/L. 
ACC requires a covalently bound biotin prosthetic group for activity, 
and in a previous study,
25 
addition of biotin to the bacterial culture 
resulted in a 65% increase of the specific activity of ACC. Based on this, 
we can infer that the addition of biotin to the medium could enhance the 
intracellular ACC activity and it is possible to some extent improve the 
3-HP production of the recombinant strain. 
Considering bicarbonate is necessary for the synthesis of malonyl- 
CoA from acetyl-CoA by ACC, the influence of sodium bicarbonate on 
the 3-HP production was also evaluated ( Fig. 4 B). The titer of 3-HP was 
1.29 g/L without adding sodium bicarbonate, and 3-HP production was 
increased to 1.44 g/L when the sodium bicarbonate was added at a 
concentration of 2 g/L. 
Finally, based on these results, 25 mg/L of biotin and 2 g/L sodium 
bicarbonate were added to the medium after induction, the production 
of 3-HP by Ec -PAM increased from 1.29 g/L to 1.69 g/L. The results of 
increasing 3-HP titer by adding biotin and bicarbonate in this work are 
similar to those published by Cheng et al.
21 
3.5. Deletion of the ygfH and prpC genes 
Propionyl-CoA is an important precursor for 3-HP formation via 
propionyl-CoA pathway, however, it can be utilized in different path -
ways, for example the TCA and the MCC cycles.
29 , 38 
In our previous 
study on propionyl-CoA pathway, an increase on the production of 3-HP 
was obtained by deleting two genes, ygfH and prpC .
15 
In this work, the 
recombinant strains with ygfH and prpC genes knocked out were con -
structed, and the resultant strains Ec- Δ Y-PAM, Ec- Δ P-PAM and 
Ec- Δ Y - Δ P-PAM were cultured in shake flask to study the improvement of 
3-HP production. 
3-HP titers of the single-gene deletion strains Ec- Δ Y-PAM and Ec- Δ P- 
PAM were 1.55 g/L and 1.74 g/L, respectively, while in the case of the 
double-gene deletion strain Ec- Δ Y - Δ P-PAM, 3-HP titer was 1.94 g/L, 
which was 1.5-fold higher than that of Ec -PAM cultured under the same 
conditions ( Fig. 5 ). The increased accumulation of 3-HP could be 
attributed to the increased propionyl-CoA pool caused by the deletion of 
ygfH and prpC genes.
39 – 41 
As shown in Table 3 , some pathways for the synthesis of 3-HP in 
E. coli were recently reported. Compared with beta-alanine pathway and 
glycerol pathway, propionyl-CoA pathway and malonyl-CoA pathway 
showed lower yields of 3-HP. While in this work, the coupled-pathway 
strategy could markedly improve the yield of 3-HP to 0.39, a rela -
tively high value. Though the primary result of 3-HP titer and yield in 
shake flask was still low in this work, there are some methods that will 
further improve the production of 3-HP. First, in this work, only one key 
enzyme PACD of propionyl-CoA pathway was overexpressed in the 
engineered strains. Thus, propionyl-CoA pathway could be further 
strengthened by co-expressing other key enzymes, HPCD and PCT,
15 
and 
more NADPH could be provided for the coupled malonyl-CoA pathway. 
The two pathways of propionyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA could be elabo -
rately regulated to generate a redox balance conducive to the synthesis 
of 3-HP. Second, the culture conditions (for example, the substrates 
concentration, pH, temperature, etc.) could be optimized, and the 
fed-batch fermentation will effectively promote 3-HP titer.

4. Conclusion 
In order to synthesize 3-HP from biobased material, some recombi -
nant strains harboring the key enzymes of the malonyl-CoA and 
propionyl-CoA pathways were constructed. By coupling the malonyl- 
CoA and propionyl-CoA pathways we successfully enhanced the pro -
duction of 3-HP in recombinant E. coli , and also managed to improve its 
production by adding biotin and sodium bicarbonate to the medium. On 
the other hand, increasing the propionyl-CoA pool in vivo by deleting the 
competitive pathways also resulted in an improvement of 3-HP pro -
duction. The titer and yield of 3-HP for the dual-pathway strain Ec- Δ Y - 
Δ P-PAM were 1.94 g/L and 0.39, respectively, which were much higher 
than those of single-pathway strains. The production of 3-HP is strongly 
correlated with the regeneration of NADPH in vivo , suggesting that it is 
necessary to precisely regulate the NADP
+
/NADPH redox balance for 
the pathways to work more efficiently. The titer and yield of 3-HP are 
still low, and the challenge of current work is to improve 3-HP pro -
ductivity by optimizing the strain and cultivation conditions.
