ABSTRACT: Biocatalysis is important in the discovery, develop-
ment, and manufacture of pharmaceuticals. However, the
identification of enzymes for target transformations of interest
requires major screening efforts. Here, we report a structure-based
computational workflow to prioritize protein sequences by a score
based on predicted activities on substrates, thereby reducing a
resource-intensive laboratory-based biocatalyst screening. We
selected imine reductases (IREDs) as a class of biocatalysts to
illustrate the application of the computational workflow termed
IREDFisher. Validation by using published data showed that
IREDFisher can retrieve the best enzymes and increase the hit rate
by identifying the top 20 ranked sequences. The power of
IREDFisher is confirmed by computationally screening 1400 sequences for chosen reductive amination reactions with different levels
of complexity. Highly active IREDs were identified by only testing 20 samples in vitro. Our speed test shows that it only takes 90 min
to rank 85 sequences from user input and 30 min for the established IREDFisher database containing 591 IRED sequences.
IREDFisher is available as a user-friendly web interface (https://enzymeevolver.com/IREDFisher). IREDFisher enables the rapid
discovery of IREDs for applications in synthesis and directed evolution studies, with minimal time and resource expenditure. Future
use of the workflow with other enzyme families could be implemented following the modification of the workflow scoring function.

INTRODUCTION
Enzymatic synthesis has gained growing attention in recent
years due to the inherent advantages of benign reaction
conditions along with exquisite chemo-, stereo-, and regio-
selectivity.
1−5
However, finding the optimal biocatalyst to
effect the transformation of a substrate of interest is often
challenging and time consuming. There are two strategies
commonly used in enzyme discovery (Figure 1, left panel).
One is to manually select the enzymes that have been reported
to be active toward similar substrate(s) in the literature.
However, this approach restricts the diversity of accessible
enzymes and may result in potentially active enzymes being
missed. Consequently, the alternative strategy of searching for
homologous enzymes from databases is increasingly applied.
However, this approach typically generates a very large number
of sequences, the majority of which have not been
characterized experimentally.
6,7
Screening all of these sequen-
ces is time consuming, requiring the extensive use of analytical
equipment and other methods for high-throughput screening.
Computational tools have shown great power in the
development and application of biocatalysts including
synthetic pathway design,
8−10
enzyme engineering,
11−14
and
de novo design.
15−18
However, in silico pipelines that prioritize
sequences and thus reduce the necessary screening throughput
in the laboratory are still underdeveloped. The current
structure-based pipelines are either struggling in dealing with
large numbers of sequences and are thus mainly used for
engineering an initially known active enzyme
19,20
or require a
detailed description of the catalytic geometry based on a
known ligand-binding motif.

Sequence-based pipe-
lines

can realize high throughput but they generally
ignore substrate variations (a key consideration in establishing
biocatalytic panels), leading to poor activity predictions of
enzymes in relation to target substrates. Standalone methods
such as homology modeling and molecular docking have been
established over many years but are generally used individually
rather than in automated combination, which limits
throughput in biocatalyst screening programs. Integration of
these approaches into an automated pipeline for biocatalyst

discovery is urgently needed to rapidly model enzyme−
substrate complexes and generate rank ordering of likely active
sequences. Only a few structure-based computational pipe-
lines
38−41
have been published. However, none of these have
been automated to enable easy access to laboratory-based
scientists. An “easy-to-use” in silico web application is required
for experimentalists who need to conduct efficient and rapid
screens to identify active enzymes but are struggling to use
more specialized computational tools. Consequently, an “easy-
to-use” in silico web-based application will streamline
experimental screening and thereby reduce the time and
resources required to identify biocatalysts for use.
Here, we report the development and experimental
validation of an in silico pipeline, available also via a web
interface, termed IREDFisher (available for use at https://
enzymeevolver.com/IREDFisher). IREDFisher is a structure-
based web server that allows computer-aided enzyme screening
with substrate(s) of interest and recommends a small (20
enzyme) panel of IREDs for rapid biocatalytic exploration by
the user (Figure 2). We selected imine reductases (IREDs) as a
model enzyme in view of their recent emergence as an enzyme
class of interest for the synthesis of chiral amines. Chiral
amines are prevalent motifs that feature in about 40% of
pharmaceuticals.
42,43
IREDs catalyze enantioselective imine
reduction and can also perform the reductive amination of
ketones or aldehydes
44−46
and are thus of major interest to the
academic and industrial biocatalysis communities. Since their
discovery in 2010,
47
a vast number of IRED sequences have
been published together with a wealth of activity data for
different substrates.
48−58
Currently, IREDFisher only applies to
IREDs as the scoring function is modified specifically for these
enzymes.

RESULTS
IREDFisher Workflow. Having the initial sequences and a
substrate structure as inputs, the IREDFisher workflow
commences with sequence preprocessing, followed by
structural modeling. Then, the provided substrate is docked
into the modeled enzyme structures, while the protein−
substrate complexes are scored by considering predicted
binding affinity and catalytic geometry in the final step (Figure
2). Specifically, in step (1), each input sequence is aligned to
individual sequences in the protein data bank (PDB). The
input sequence that has the highest sequence identity to
known IREDs in the PDB is considered as a putative IRED and
retained for the next step. In step (2), all three-dimensional
structures of the resulting sequences from step (1) are
generated by MODELLER
59
followed by an optimization by
the default function in MODELLER,
59
which consists of
spatial restraints on distance and dihedral angles obtained from
the target structure and CHARMM energy terms enforcing
proper stereochemistry.
60
All models are evaluated based on
the Ramachandran plot, and only those that have over 90% of
the residues in favorable/coreregions are defined as qualified
models and subsequently used for substrate docking. In step
(3), the substrate is docked into the active site of each qualified
model. Various poses of the substrate in the active site of the
enzymes are generated. In step (4), the distance between
NADPH C4 and N atom of the imine substrate is calculated
for all poses. The pose with ∼4 Å is selected as the best pose to
realize hydride transfer in a catalytic process (see pose
selection in Figure 2 and details in the Methods section). In
step (5), the number of acidic residues N

was used to finally rank all input sequences. The top 20
IRED sequences are then selected for in vitro screening.
IREDFisher Validation Using Published Screening
Data. The screening data from three established IRED panels
were used to test the IREDFisher workflow: Roiban et al.

52
(45 sequences) for substrates 10−17, and Mont-
gomery et al. IRED panel
53
(93 sequences) for 18−24 (Figure
3). Each panel and the corresponding tested substrates were
fed into IREDFisher to obtain the recommended 20
sequences. As control, 20 sequences were randomly selected
from each corresponding panel. Hit rates using a conversion
cutoff of 2% (hit rate of ≥ 2% conversion) and 50% (hit rate of
≥ 50% conversion) were calculated and compared between the
two methods (Figure 4a,b and Table S1). The likelihood of
retrieving the best hit in the 20 selected sequences using the
two methods was also calculated (Figure 4c and Table S2). In

terms of “hit rate of ≥ 2% conversion”, IREDFisher is
comparable to random selection, whereas it outperforms the
latter in finding hits with conversions over 50% (Figure 4b).
This shows the capability of IREDFisher in finding competent
hits for downstream optimization. Furthermore, IREDFisher
retrieved the best hit to the top 20 sequences with a likelihood
of 100%. By contrast, the likelihood of picking the best hit by
random selection is no more than 50%. In summary, the
IREDFisher workflow is not only able to improve the hit rate
but also retrieves the best enzyme(s) from the whole IRED
panel in the top 20 selected sequences. This emphasizes the
effectiveness of IREDFisher in finding IRED hits, reducing
screening efforts by 50−75%.
Experimental Validation of Predictions Made by
IREDFisher. Next, we challenged the IREDFisher workflow
by aiming to select potential IRED hits for subsequent
validation by experimental screening. We chose the following
reductive amination reactions as our targets, namely, 18 and
25−28 (Figure 5a), which represent increasingly demanding
conversions for imine reductases. Reactions corresponding to
products 18 and 25 are common starting points for screening
IREDs, whereas products 26 and 27 are important building
blocks in the pharmaceutical industry and proved to be
challenging targets in a previous IRED study.
48
Synthesis of 28
is particularly challenging due to the negative charge of the
carboxylate group in the substrate. To date, no IREDs have
been reported to accept 4-formylbenzoic acid as a substrate.
Also, we note that 4-formylbenzoic acid 28 is a building block
for drugs such as procarbazine (chemotherapy), imatinib
(chemotherapy), mocetinostat, etinostat, tucidinostat (HDAC
Figure 2. Flow chart of the four-step IREDFisher workflow. The input sequences are preprocessed in step (1) to remove non-IRED-homologs from
the screening list. The three-dimensional structures of the remaining sequences are modeled in step (2). In step (3), the structures obtained from
step (2) are aligned to a cofactor- and ligand-bound IRED crystal structure to locate the active site and cofactor binding site for each modeled
structure. NADPH is placed into individual modeled structures by taking the coordinates from the crystal structure. An intermediate imine
structure formed by amine and ketone substrates is then docked into the active site of each structure. In step (4), the best pose for the substrate
within the enzyme is selected by the distance between two key atoms of the cofactor and substrate. In crystal structures of IREDs, this distance is
around 4 Å. In step (5), the number of acidic residues N

treatment), and fedovapagon (nocturia treatment) (Figure
S1). Inclusion of 28 was used to explore whether the
IREDFisher workflow could identify biocatalysts for novel
reductive amination reactions.
For sequence input, we used 193 well-expressed enzymes
from our in-house panel along with 33 new sequences found
by IREDFisher that are also expressed well. To find new active
enzymes toward selected targets, we collected uncharacterized
IRED homologs from public databases (NCBI and UniProt)
and IREDs from established panels (Robian et al.,

France et
al.,
52

54
and Yao et al.

), generating 1239
sequences in total (Figure 5a, lower panel). Then, the first
round of the IREDFisher ranking was run for the collected
sequences based on the targeted product to prioritize
successful gene synthesis and protein expression. The top 20
enzyme sequences for targets 18 and 25−30 were selected in
silico. Then, 60 sequences were identified after removing
duplicates from which genes were synthesized and expressed in
E. coli. This resulted in 33 enzymes (55% of selected enzymes)
that expressed well in E. coli, while 27 enzymes (45% of
selected enzymes) failed in cloning and/or expression.
We then combined these 33 enzymes with 193 sequences
from our in-house panel and ran a second round of

IREDFisher ranking to prioritize these sequences in activity
screening experiments. The top 20 IREDs obtained by
IREDFisher for each targeted reaction were screened in
vitro, and corresponding conversions to products were
determined by GC or HPLC (Figure 5b). Reaction
optimization was not carried out, as only the relative efficiency
of IREDFisher under standardized conditions was being
evaluated. For target reactions 18 and 25−28, the hit rate
decreases as the difficulty of the IRED reactions increases, with
2−11 hits (over 90% conversion) of corresponding substrates
obtained. In a previous study, the hit rate of 26 (26b in a

screening a panel of 384 IREDs was low (2.6% for 26 and 5.5%
for 27), whereas the hit rate in this study employing
IREDFisher increased substantially to 60 and 40%, respec-
tively. Notably, two hits, with conversion ≥ 90%, were found
for the challenging product 28, demonstrating that IREDFisher
can find enzymes that catalyze reactions of pharmaceutical
importance. Furthermore, by exploiting the resources from
public databases, highly active IREDs that have not been
reported previously were identified and multiple enzymes (e.g.,
yIRED10, yIRED23, yIRED25) were found to have broad
substrate scope. The benefit of IREDFisher in prioritizing
screening is clear, in this case reducing the experimental
screening required from ≥ 1000 samples without IREDFisher
virtual screening to only 20 samples.
IREDFisher Web Interface and Speed Test. Encouraged
by the validation results using established screening data and
our own experiments, our intention was to develop a user-
friendly workflow that can be widely used by the biocatalysis
community. To avoid any requirement for the use of personal
computational/programming skills, we have built an IRED-
Fisher web server (https://enzymeevolver.com/IREDFisher)
(Figure 6). We emphasize that the current methodology only
applies to IREDs. For the input structure, the imine structure
formed by the condensation of aldehyde or ketone and amine
is required. This can be obtained by the free online structure
drawing tool Marvin JS (https://marvinjs-demo.chemaxon.
com/latest/) from ChemAxon (Figure 6a, example in the
square on the right). The index of the N atom in the C�N
bond is also required as an input, which can be generated using
the Marvin interface. A FASTA-formatted sequence file is
required if users intend to rank their own sequences (Figure
6a, example in the square on the left). After the job is
submitted, output files such as three-dimensional structures of
IREDs, substrate-bound complex structures, and scoring files
are generated and added to the web page. By checking the
sorted rescoring file, the user can obtain an optimized small

IRED screening panel with 20 recommended sequences by
IREDFisher (Figure 6b). In addition, IREDFisher also allows
users to rank the sequences from established panels and public
databases (see the Methods section for details). Therefore,
IREDFisher can be employed in ranking: (i) user-defined
sequences; (ii) established IRED panels, e.g., Robian et al.,
56
France et al.,
52
Wetzl et al.,
54
etc.; and (iii) IRED sequences
collected from the public database in this study. The speed test
showed that IREDFisher can perform the calculation of a user-
defined panel with 85 sequences in 90 min. Moreover, it only
takes ca 30 min to complete the ranking of the established
IRED panels and sequences from public databases by using the
structures already deposited in the IREDFisher web server.
Consequently, based on simple data input, nonspecialists in
bioinformatics can have access to workflow outputs using only
a few mouse clicks without human interference, which makes it
applicable for small IRED panel design.
■
DISCUSSION
The computational four-step workflow IREDFisher that aims
to streamline the screening of enzyme panels was produced by
integrating sequence analysis, structure modeling, and
molecular docking. Although large numbers of protein
structures have been released recently by AlphaFold,
62
the
structures obtained are not always applicable for the use of
molecular docking. For many enzymes, the substrate-binding
site is formed by monomers/dimers, but only monomeric
structures were deposited in the database. For example, most
of the new sequences used in this study were only modeled as
monomer in the AlphaFold database. We have shown that the
active site is similar between the dimer models generated by
homology modeling and AlphaFold (Figure S2), while the
former approach saves considerable computation time (3 min
by homology modeling versus 30 min by AlphaFold per
structure). This is also suggested by a previous publication.
63
Therefore, the template-based homology modeling is beneficial
for the rapid building of structures in the IREDFisher
workflow, allowing users to rank large numbers of sequences.
The workflow was applied by using a model enzyme IRED
and subsequently validated using previously published screen-
ing data. IREDFisher demonstrated the power of retrieving the
best hit found simply by screening a small panel of 20
sequences using the IREDFisher workflow. Experimental
validation in which IREDFisher selects 20 enzymes from a
pool of ∼1400 sequences for 5 reactions, and with different
levels of product complexity, further establishes the effective-
ness of IREDFisher. IREDFisher ranks enzymes based on
enzyme−substrate-binding interactions and does not consider
features such as the charge distribution on the protein surface,
which might, for example, be important for successful protein
expression in E. coli. As such, poorly expressed proteins could
rank better than proteins that are expressed well in E. coli. The
workflow was run initially to identify sequences for gene
synthesis and protein expression analysis. We then performed a
second screening experiment to rank new IRED biocatalysts
only with those sequences that expressed well in E. coli. The
prediction of enantioselectivity by IREDFisher is not
investigated in this study because this is challenging. That
said, IREDFisher narrows the search to a small panel of IREDs
such that screening those biocatalysts for enantioselectivity is
no longer an onerous task.
It is noteworthy that most biocatalytic processes for drug
production need to go through extensive reaction optimization
and mutagenesis approaches such as directed evolution to
obtain a biocatalyst that fulfills the desired process require-
ments. Directed evolution relies on the screening of thousands
of enzyme variants and usually involves several rounds of
library generation and screening, resulting in large numbers of
variants that require high-throughput screening (HTS)
methods for their evaluation. As such, screening remains the
major bottleneck in biocatalysis applications, and this places
major burdens on the resources and time required to generate
a suitable biocatalyst. By taking advantage of the IREDFisher
computational workflow, we have shown that it is possible to
identify suitable biocatalysts for simple and challenging
substrates. If needed, these could be evolved further to fulfill
process needs with reduced screening efforts. IREDFisher is
therefore valuable, either as a standalone computational
workflow to aid the rapid identification of biocatalysts or as
a “front-end’ workflow to accelerate directed evolution
programs by selecting the prototype, catalytically competent
enzyme scaffolds for a target reaction. However, we clarify that
IREDFisher takes wild-type sequences as input, which limits its
ability to “design” enzymes with non-natural functions to
catalyze extremely challenging reactions.
IREDFisher is designed as a “fast prescreen method” to rank
input sequences. As such, it has limitations. Protein dynamics
and energy barrier calculations are not incorporated because
this would be too time consuming for a fast prescreening tool
for use by experimentalists. The IREDFisher scoring function
works as a tool to rank input sequences instead of accurately
predicting the conversion/activity of enzymes. We trained the
scoring instead to deliver a maximum hit rate of the top 20
sequences because 20 screening experiments can be carried out
in one batch with overnight incubation for rapid enzyme
screening. That said, the IREDFisher workflow has the power
to find highly active hits in the 20 recommended sequences.
This indicates that a trade-off between speed and accuracy has
been achieved to some extent. Currently, it is applicable to
IREDs as the scoring function is designed specifically for this
enzyme family. We have also tested IREDFisher on haloalkane
dehydrogenases and compared our results with a previous
study.
39,40
Only one enzyme identified by this previous study
was ranked in the top 20 sequences from IREDFisher. Clearly,
generic substrate inputs and associated scoring functions will
need to be explored to expand the utility of our workflow to
different enzyme reactions. Specifically, reactive atoms in the
substrate and catalytic residues in the enzyme should be
provided by the user to help select the best binding pose after
docking. Also, deep learning methods are promising
approaches to train a model, e.g., by taking features from
predicted binding modes such as distances and angles between
key atoms, atom types, and charge distributions in the active
site. This challenge, together with integration into Retro-
Biocat,
8
will be implemented to enable the process from the
biocatalytic pathway design all the way through to the
generation of small screening panels to allow for direct hit
identification.
In summary, the development and use of IREDFisher have
reduced the size of screening panels to only 20 enzymes, with
significant savings in resource and time required to perform the
experimental screening. For challenging substrates, where
conversions with the wild-type enzyme may be low, the hits
obtained could then be used as a parent sequence for
subsequent directed evolution approaches. The workflow
provides a user-friendly free web interface (https://

enzymeevolver.com/IREDFisher), requiring no experience in
computational chemistry or programming, which users can
implement with only a few “mouse clicks”. The expansion of
the web tool to other enzyme classes is envisaged with more
accurate scoring functions, taking advantage of machine
learning and other approaches. This will assist in the
identification of enzymes for transformations of interest from
a plethora of continuously growing sequence data and,
therefore, contribute to the increasing application of
biocatalytic methods in the synthesis.

METHODS
IREDFisher Four-Step Panel Optimization Workflow.
Sequence Preprocessing. A FASTA-formatted sequence file
given by the user was loaded into the workflow. Each
individual sequence was generated by splitting the whole
sequences. For sequence, we searched homologous proteins in
the Protein Data Bank using MODELLER.
59
The one with the
highest sequence identity was considered as the template
protein of the query sequence. For imine reductases, only
sequences with characterized IREDs (PDB codes: 3ZGY,
64
4D3D,
65
4D3S,
65
4OQY,
66
4OQZ,

5OCM,
68
5OJL,
69
6EOD,
44
6JIT, 6JIZ, 6GRL, and 5G6R) as the
template proteins were retained for the next step.
Structure Modeling. IREDs form homodimers with the
active site located at the interface between the monomers, thus
making it more challenging to build a model in an automated
way.
70
The general sequence alignment between the template
protein and query sequence was calculated only for one chain.
To overcome this issue, the single-chain sequence alignment
between each query sequence and the template protein was
repeated once more by an in-house script to generate a double-
chain sequence alignment file. To automate the modeling of
the IRED dimeric form, a template protein needs to be
specified. The imine reductase from Streptosporangium roseum
(PDB code: 5OCM
68
) is selected as the dimer template
protein given its high resolution and the clear substrate and
cofactor NADPH binding site. Then, models are generated and
optimized using MODELLER
59
based on the modified double-
chain sequence alignment. All models are evaluated based on
the Ramachandran plot, and only those that have over 90% of
the residues in the favorable/core region are defined as
qualified models and subsequently are used for substrate
docking.
Molecular Docking. To locate the active site easily, all
three-dimensional structures obtained from the last step are
aligned to the template structure 5OCM by the PyMol python
library. The cofactor NADPH is directly placed into the
cofactor binding site of each modeled structure using the
reference NADPH from the crystal structure prior to substrate
docking. The center of mass of the bound ligand 9RH in
5OCM is used as the center of the docking box. The docking
box size is calculated by using script eBoxSize.pl,
71
considering
the gyration radius of the substrate, which improves the
docking accuracy.
71
Then, all aligned structures with the
bound NADPH are prepared using AutoDockTools.
72
To
input the structure of the imine form of the substrate formed
by the condensation of amine and ketone, the three-
dimensional coordinates are generated by Babel
73
and then
prepared using AutoDockTools.
72
Multiple poses are gen-
erated by Autodock vina
61
with exhaustiveness value 10.
Scoring and ranking. When the IRED reaction occurs,
NADPH transfers a hydride from atom C4 to the imine
substrate.
44,70,74
To obtain the most reliable pose, the distance
between the C4 atom in NADPH and N in imine, the substrate
is used as a criterion (Figure 2). Docking poses with the C4···
N distance shorter than 3.5 Å are removed to avoid clashes.
Poses with the C4···N distance longer than 6.0 Å are also
removed because it is beyond the distance range for hydride
transfer. The remaining poses having the closest C4···N
distance are selected as the best model. To improve the scoring
function, we take the catalytic mechanism, proton transfer, and
hydride transfer
75
into consideration. It has been reported that
acidic residues, basic residues, and a conserved histidine
residue in the active site play important roles in the
stabilization of the key intermediate in the IRED-catalyzed
reaction.
75
Accordingly, we included three terms in the scoring
function: the number of acidic residues N
acidic
, the number of
basic residues N
basic
, and the presence of histidine residues to
represent the effect enzymes have on reactions. The final
scoring function after the optimization of hyperparameters is
refined score = 4.0 × Vina score + 1.0 × N
acidic
− 9.0 × N
His
+
9.0 × N
basic
. In this equation, N
acidic
/N
basic
is the total number
of acidic/basic residues in the active site and N
His
is the
presence (N
His
= 1) or absence of histidine (N
his
= 0) residue
in the active site. The weights for each component of the
scoring function were tuned by running with a range of −10 to
10 using compounds 18−24 screened by Montgomery et al.
IRED panel,
53
and the best weight was decided by the highest
percentage of hits with conversion over 50% in the top 20 list.
The scoring function was tested by Roiban et al. panel
56
for
substrates 1−9 and France et al. panel
52
for substrates 10−17.
Only residues within 8 angstroms of the ligand are taken into
account when we count the number of key residues.
IREDFisher Structure Databases. To help users design
an IRED screening panel from scratch by the IREDFisher
workflow, we collected published IRED panels: GSK panel in
2017,
56
MIB panel in 2018,
52
MIB panel in 2020,
53
MIB
metagenomic panel in 2021,
48
Roche panel in 2016,
55
and
Peiyuan Yao panel
51
in 2018. After sequence preprocessing
step, a total of 451 published sequences were collected
including the characterized IRED sequences.
To make use of the public database, we conducted
homology search in UniProt
6
and NCBI reference protein
76
databases using the characterized IREDs as seed sequences.
Homologous sequences with sequence identity over 30%,
coverage over 80%, and E-value under 10 compared to the
corresponding seed sequence were downloaded. 1028
sequences were collected after removing duplicates, followed
by a clustering with threshold 0.7 by cd-hit.
77
After sequence
preprocessing, a total of 591 sequences were collected from the
public database.
All of the above sequences were modeled and prepared for
docking by the IREDFisher workflow. With the well-prepared
structure database, IREDFisher runs much faster.

ENZYME SCREENING FOR TARGET PRODUCT 28
Previous test reactions were carried on at pH 8 as IREDs
usually exhibit higher activities on slightly basic pH. However,
reaction test 3 was done at pH 6 since the acid is partially
deprotonated and the aim was to use pH values closer to
formylbenzoic acid pKa to make it less negatively charged.
Analytical scale reductive amination biotransformations were
carried out on a 500 μL scale adjusted to pH 6.0 containing 4
mg/mL of lyophilized powder of the supernatant of lysate
IRED, 0.5 mg/mL of GDH (Codexis CDX-901), 0.5 mM of
NADP
