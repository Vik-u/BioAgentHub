Abstract
Previous studies have assessed how supplementing withGarcinia cambogiaaffects glycaemic
control and liver enzyme levels; nevertheless, the results were not consistent. The study aimed to
evaluate the impact ofGarcinia cambogiaon glycaemic control and liver enzymes through a
systematic review and meta-analysis. Searches were conducted from the beginning through
February 2023, using online databases (Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and Cochrane
Library). Trials examining the impact ofGarcinia cambogiaon serum levels of fasting blood
sugar (FBS), serum level of insulin, alanine transaminase (ALT), and aspartate transaminase
(AST) in adults were included. The overall estimates and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs)
were calculated using a random-effects model. This meta-analysis includes nine publications
with 444 participants. The results showed thatGarcinia cambogiahas no significant effect on
FBS (weighted mean difference (WMD): 1.02 mg/dl, 95% CI:−1.29, 3.33), insulin (WMD:
−0.12 mU/L, 95% CI:−1.50, 1.25), AST (Hedges’ g: −0.08, 95% CI:−0.43, 0.26), and ALT
(Hedges’ g: 0.27, 95% CI:−0.20, 0.73). Subgroup analysis showed thatGarcinia cambogia
significantly increased insulin levels in females and also increased insulin and FBS levels in those
with a BMI≥30 kg/m2. Nevertheless, the administration ofGarcinia cambogiafor more than
8 weeks significantly decreased insulin levels. This meta-analysis showed that supplementation
with Garcinia cambogiahas no significant effect on FBS, insulin, ALT, or AST levels compared
with control groups; however, it seems that increasing the duration of the intervention may have
a decreasing effect on insulin levels.
Introduction
In the current world population, some disorders like liver diseases, chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease, cancer, diabetes, and CVDs are the leading causes of mortality. The
prevalence of these disorders is closely correlated with lifestyle choices like physical activity, diet,
smoking, and alcohol use(1– 4). Alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase (AST)
are two important enzymes in diagnosing liver diseases. An increase in the level of these enzymes
indicates liver damage. It has been demonstrated that variations in the amounts of these two
enzymes have negative effects on one’s health(5,6). On the other hand, the importance of
glycaemic management for human health has been demonstrated in earlier research (7,8).
Garcinia cambogia(native to Southeast Asia) is one of the plants that has been shown to play an
important role in human health. This plant has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant
characteristics and is effective in the management of liver abnormalities and glycaemic control.
A bioactive compound called hydroxycitric acid (HCA) is mainly responsible for these
therapeutic effects(9).
Previous studies on the use ofGarcinia cambogia in the adult population have yielded
conflicting results when examining metabolic indicators such as insulin, blood glucose, ALT,
and AST. It seems that age, sex, BMI, and intervention duration were the main potential sources
of heterogeneity. In one study, it was found that orlistat in combination withGarcinia cambogia
or each alone did not have a significant effect on postprandial
glucose and fasting blood glucose in obese men(10). Other studies
have also shown thatGarcinia cambogiaextract supplementation
does not have a considerable effect on glycaemic control and liver
transaminases in healthy individuals
(11– 16). A study conducted on
obese adults in Taiwan showed that the serum AST level in the
group receiving only Garcinia cambogia significantly decreased,
but insulin and glucose levels and serum ALT did not change
significantly
(17). On the contrary,Garcinia cambogiaextract along
with a calorie-restricted diet has led to increased liver enzymes and
failure to control glycaemic parameters
(18).
Therefore, considering the conflicting and heterogeneous
results of previous studies, the objective of this study is to
systematically review and meta-analyse the existing research on the
impact of Garcinia cambogia supplementation on glycaemic
control and liver enzymes in the adult population.
Methods
Search strategy
Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-
Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed when conducting the
current systematic review and meta-analysis
(19) and were registered
at PROSPERO (CRD42023428039). The systematic literature search
of Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed/Medline, Google Scholar, and
Cochrane Library databases was conducted up to 9 February 2023.
In order to conduct our search technique, the following MeSH and
non-MeSH phrases were combined: ( ‘Garcinia cambogia’ OR
‘Hydroxycitric Acid’ OR Hydroxycitrate OR brindleberry OR
‘Malabar tamarind’ OR kudampuli) AND (intervention OR RCT
OR Randomly OR randomised OR random OR Placebo OR trials
OR trial OR randomised). There was no time limit, and we included
only English-language articles. Two independent authors (MRA,
ST) reviewed the titles and abstracts to find related publications.
Additionally, to guarantee that all potentially relevant papers were
found, the reference lists of the included research and pertinent
reviews were carefully searched.
Selection criteria
To determine eligibility, the population, intervention, comparison,
outcome, and study design (PICOS) criteria
(20) were used.
Studies were selected based on the following inclusion criteria:
(1) designed as randomised controlled trials (RCT) (either parallel
or crossover); (2) examined the effects ofGarcinia cambogia in
humans (either healthy or unhealthy subjects); (3) investigated
fasting blood sugar (FBS), insulin, ALT, and AST levels for both
treatment and control groups at baseline and at the end of the study;
(4) involved adult individuals (aged≥ 18 years); and (5) provided
means and SDs of desired outcomes or any other effect sizes being
convertible to means and SDs. We excluded articles with non-
randomised study designs, animal studies, observational studies,
in vitroresearch, papers without a placebo group, studies conducted
on children or adolescents, conference abstracts, and reviews.
Data extraction
Two different researchers (MRA and ST) independently extracted
the pertinent information from each included article using
common data extraction forms, such as the name of the first
author, the year that the work was published, the nation, the study’s
design, the participant’s health status, their gender, the sample size,
their average age and BMI, the duration of the intervention, the
dosage ofGarcinia cambogiasupplementation (and its equivalent
in HCA), the comparison group, and the averages and standard
deviations of their FBS, insulin, ALT, and AST levels both before
and after the intervention for the treatment and control groups.
Our primary outcome was FBS levels. The secondary outcomes
were insulin, ALT, and AST levels. In studies where relevant
information was not provided, the respective authors were emailed
to ask for more details.
Quality assessment
Two reviewers (MRA and ST) independently assessed the
methodological quality of the chosen papers using the Cochrane
risk-of-bias tool for randomised trials (RoB 1),
(21) which rate the
quality of studies based on random sequence generation, allocation
concealment, selective reporting, blinding of participants, and staff,
blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, and
other likely sources of bias. Any disagreements were handled
through conversation. Methodological defects affecting the findings
of the study gave rise to a‘high risk’ score for each domain, while a
‘low risk’ score was given to each defect-free domain. When the
information was not sufficient to evaluate the impact, the domain
was scored‘unclear risk’. According to the Cochrane Handbook’s
guideline, the studies were finally classified as having a low risk of
bias, a high risk of bias, or an uncertain bias
(21) (Table 1).
Statistical analysis
Using the random-effects method (DerSimonian and Laird)(22),
standardised mean differences, estimated by Hedges’ g, with the
95% confidence intervals (CIs) of ALT and AST were used as
opposed to weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% CIs for
glucose and insulin. Also, in studies that only provided SEM
(standard error of the mean), SDs were derived using the following
formula: SD= SEM × pn, where n is the number of participants in
each group. When medians and interquartile ranges were
presented instead of mean and SD values, SDs were obtained
using SD = interquartile range/1.35 (symmetrical data distribu-
tion)
(23). If RCTs did not report the SDs of the change, we
calculated them using the following formula in which the
correlation coefficient (R) was considered 0.8: SD
difference =
Square Root [(SDpre-treatment)2 þ (SDpost-treatment)2 − (2 × R ×
SDpre-treatment × SDpost-treatment)](24). Using the Cochrane’s Q-test
and theI-squared (I2) values, the heterogeneity among studies was
evaluated. If I2 values >50% or P<0.05, between-study hetero-
geneity was regarded as significant(25,26). We conducted a stratified
analysis to determine the cause of the heterogeneity among the
examined studies. Sensitivity analyses were carried out by
excluding each study individually and rerunning the pooled
analysis in order to examine the impact of each study on the overall
effect size. To identify the likely publication bias, Egger’s regression
test was used
(27). All statistical tests were performed using STATA,
version 14 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA). Statistics
were considered significant for P-values under 0.05.

abstract screening approach, which resulted in the exclusion of 440
articles due to no relevant or original data (n= 196), animal studies
(n = 160), and reviews (n= 84). From twenty-four studies that
entered the full-text examination, fifteen studies were excluded
because of the following reasons: irrelevant research (n= 9), no
control group (n= 2), inadequate data of interest (n= 1), the same
participants (n = 2), and combined intervention (n = 1). Nine
RCTs(10– 18) were finally included in the qualitative and quantitative
synthesis (Fig.1).
Study characteristics
The detailed characteristics of selected studies are summarised
in Table2. These trials have involved 444 participants. The range
of publication years of selected articles was between 2001 and
2022. Two studies were carried out in Japan(14,15), one in the
Netherlands(12), one in Korea(13), one in Taiwan(17), one in Brazil(11),
one in Germany(16), one in Iraq(10), and one in Iran(18). All studies
were RCTs that were conducted on adult subjects aged≥ 18 years.
Two studies included only women (11,18), two included only
men(10,12), and the rest of the RCTs were conducted on both
genders(13– 17). The mean BMI varied from 21.8 to 38.1 kg/m2 among
eligible articles. Except for two studies conducted on obese(10) and
non-alcoholic fatty liver disease(18) patients, other studies involved
healthy individuals(11– 17). The sample size of the eligible studies
ranged between ten and eighty-four subjects in both treatment and
control groups. The dose of Garcinia cambogia extract supple-
mentation ranged between 166 and 2800 mg/d. The control group
received a placebo except for two studies in which the control group
received orlistat(10) and a calorie-restricted diet(18).T h er a n g eo f
intervention length was from 11 d to 16 weeks among RCTs.
Risk of bias assessment
A ss h o w ni nT a b l e1, in terms of random sequence generation,
all studies(10– 18) were scored with low risk since they mentioned
random sequence generation methods. Additionally, five studies
were evaluated as low risk for allocation concealment(13– 16,18);
however, four were rated with unclear risk(10– 12,17). Researchers
blinding was performed in no studies and was, thus, identified as
high risk. Except for two studies that were considered as having
a high risk of bias in the participants blinding (10,18),o t h e r s
reported that the participants were blinded and were given a low
risk score. All studies were considered as having a low risk of
bias in selective reporting. Eight RCTs explicitly mentioned
incomplete outcome data receiving a low risk of bias(10– 13,15– 18).
Since all studies were rated as having a high risk of bias in one
domain (blinding of outcome assessment), they were considered
as low quality.
Primary outcomes
Effect of Garcinia cambogia on FBS
As an end measure, the effects ofGarcinia cambogiaadministra-
tion on FBS levels were investigated in seven trials(10,12,14– 18).T h e
random-effects model ’s overall findings showed that taking
Garcinia cambogia supplements did not significantly alter FBS
levels (WMD: 1.02 mg/dl, 95% CI:−1.29, 3.33, P= 0.378) (I2 =
52.4%, P= 0.050) (Fig.2). According to Egger’s regression test, we
did not find any evidence of publication bias for FBS concen-
trations (P= 0.335). To determine the impact of a single study on
the total effect size, the sensitivity analysis was conducted by
excluding each trial one at a time. Sensitivity analysis indicated that
the overall effect ofGarcinia cambogia supplementation on FBS
was not dependent on any single study.
Due to significant heterogeneity among studies, subgroup
analysis was also performed in which we stratified RCTs based on
the intervention duration ( ≤ 8o r > 8 weeks), age ( < 40 or
≥ 40 years), BMI (< 25, 25– 29.9, or≥ 30 kg/m2), and sex (both,
male, or female). The heterogeneity was reduced when subgroup
analysis was performed based on intervention duration (I2 = 0%,
P = 0.779), age (I2 = 0%, P= 0.779), and sex (I2 = 0%, P= 0.948).
When individuals were< 40 years and the duration of intervention
was less than 8 weeks, Garcinia cambogia supplementation
reduced FBS levels; however, it was not statistically significant
(WMD: −0.38 mg/dl, 95% CI: −2.3, 1.54, P = 0.134), and
(WMD: −0.38 mg/dl, 95% CI:−2.3, 1.54, P= 0.134), respectively.
In studies that mean BMI of participants was≥ 30 kg/m2, FBS
increased following Garcinia cambogia consumption (WMD:
3.57 mg/dl, 95% CI: 0.34, 6.80, P = 0.030). Similarly, female
participants experienced increased levels of FBS following
Garcinia cambogia supplementation (WMD: 5.41 mg/dl, 95%
CI: 1.21, 9.61, P= 0.012) (Table3).

Garcinia cambogia on glycaemic control 3
Secondary outcomes
Effect of Garcinia cambogia on insulin
The effect of Garcinia cambogia supplementation on insulin
concentrations was considered in six RCTs (11,12,14,15,17,18).
Combined results using the random-effects model (Fig.3) showed
that there was no significant effect of Garcinia cambogia
consumption on insulin levels (WMD: −0.12 mU/L, 95% CI:
−1.50, 1.25, P = 0.861) with significant between-study hetero-
geneity ( I2 = 64.2%, P = 0.016). There was no evidence of
publication bias (P= 0.719). The results of the sensitivity analysis
showed that none of the individual studies had a significant effect
on the overall effect size of findings.
When the BMI (I
2 = 47.3%, P= 0.150) and sex (I2 = 47.3%,
P = 0.150) subgroups were analysed, the heterogeneity vanished.
Most reduction in insulin was found among participants of
normal range (BMI= 18.5-24.9) when compared to participants
with overweight (BMI = 25– 29.9) following intervention
(WMD: −1.05 mU/L, 95% CI:−2.68, 0.58, P= 0.207 vs. WMD:
−0.64 mU/L, 95% CI: −1.78, 0.51, P = 0.276). Likewise, the
reducing effect of Garcinia cambogia on insulin was greater in
males (WMD: −1.05 mU/L, 95% CI: −2.68, 0.58, P = 0.207
compared by both genders (WMD:−0.64 mU/L, 95% CI:−1.78,
0.51, P = 0.276). These results also demonstrated that insulin
levels significantly increased in trials conducted on females
(WMD: 1.81 mU/L, 95% CI: 0.28, 3.34, P= 0.021) and participants
with mean BMI≥ 30 kg/m
2 (WMD: 1.81 mU/L, 95% CI: 0.28, 3.34,
P = 0.021) (Table3).
Effect of Garcinia cambogia on ALT
A total of six studies(13– 18) provided changes in ALT levels as an
outcome measure. The results of the pooled analysis (Fig. 4)
revealed that Garcinia cambogia supplementation did not alter
ALT concentrations significantly (Hedges’ g: 0.27, 95% CI:−0.20,
0.73, P = 0.264) (I2 = 76.9%, P = 0.001). Egger’s regression test
found no significant publication bias among selected trials
(P = 0.330). The findings were unchanged when any RCT was
eliminated and no significant changes to our results occurred.

Garcinia cambogia on glycaemic control 5
Due to the significant heterogeneity among RCTs, stratified
analysis was also carried out by trial duration ( I2 = 26.1%,
P = 0.258) and age (I2 = 0%, P= 0.492), which decreased hetero-
geneity (Table 3). Non-significant changes in ALT levels were
observed when studies were classified based on trial duration
and age.
Effect of Garcinia cambogia on AST
The pooled mean differences of six trials
(13– 18) illustrated a non-
significant effect on AST levels compared to the control group
following Garcinia cambogiaintervention (Hedges’ g: −0.08, 95%
CI: −0.43, 0.26, P= 0.632) (Fig. 5). We found no evidence of
publication bias for AST levels (P= 0.638). According to the results
of the sensitivity analysis, none of the studies exerted significant
effects on the combined effect size.
Although there was a lot of heterogeneities among the articles, it
was reduced when trials were grouped by age (I
2 = 5.7%, P= 0.303)
and the duration ( I2 = 34.5%, P = 0.217) of the intervention
(Table 3). The non-significant effect of Garcinia cambogia on
AST levels remained after classifying articles by aforementioned
variables with a higher reducing effect among subjects aged
> 40 years (Hedges’ g: −1.01, 95% CI:−0.37, 0.34, P= 0.951).
Discussion
The primary outcome of the current systematic review and meta-
analysis was that there was no significant effect on FBS. The
secondary outcomes indicated consumption ofGarcinia cambogia
has no significant influence on insulin, AST, or ALT. Although
subgroup analysis showed Garcinia cambogia significantly
increased FBS and insulin levels in women with a BMI≥30, it
significantly reduced insulin levels when it was used for more than
8 weeks of administration.
Primary outcomes
Effect of Garcinia cambogia on FBS
Our results are in agreement with previous studies. In animal
studies, Hayamizue et al. demonstrated that the administration of
garcinia daily to mice for a duration of 28 d had no effect on the
serum glucose level of the mice
(28). Moreover, Shetty et al found no
hypoglycaemic effect on diabetic rat models treated withGarcinia
cambogia for 21 d(29). Another study in healthy obese men has
indicated that treatment with 166 mg/dGarcinia cambogia for
3 months did not affect glucose levels(10). According to Chonge
et al.’s study, administeringGarcinia cambogia extract with 50%
HCA (1950 mg) twice daily for a duration of 12 weeks did not
result in any significant alteration in glucose levels in healthy
overweight adults(16). In an animal study, oral administration of
HCA at a dose of 310 mg/kg/bw reduced glucose levels in rats(30).I n
another animal study, Kirana et al. showed the aqueous extract of
Garcinia cambogia rind at 100 and 200 mg/kg/bw decreased
glucose in diabetic rat models
(31). Differences in studies may be
attributed to differences in population, intervention duration,
doses, and formulation ofGarcinia cambogia, which influence the
bioavailability ofGarcinia cambogia. The phytochemical makeup
of a plant extract also influences its biological capabilities. The
phytochemical composition can vary depending on geographical
location, climate, and soil type
(32,33). Moreover, the common
significant effect ofGarcinia cambogiaon the reduction of glucose
levels was seen in subjects with a high baseline range of glucose
levels(34).
Secondary outcomes
Effect of Garcinia cambogia on insulin
Furthermore, according to the results of our study, Vasque et al.
reported that insulin levels did not change after receiving 2.4 g of

Garcinia cambogia on glycaemic control 7
Garcinia cambogiaextract with 50% HCA for 60 d(11). In patients
with type 2 diabetes, small intestinal infusions of 2800 mg HCA did
not affect blood glucose or plasma insulin(35). In contrast, HCA
supplementation in exercised individuals at 500 mg/d for 7 d
enhanced post-meal insulin sensitivity (36). Differences among
studies may be for various populations, intervention duration,
Garcinia cambogiadoses, and formulation ofGarcinia cambogia,
which may influence the bioavailability ofGarcinia cambogia.
One possible mechanism that explains the link between
Garcinia cambogia and glycaemic factors is a competition of
HCA with citric acid for citrate lyase, which leads to reduced
decomposition of citric acid and increased cellular citric acid that
cause inhabitation of glycolysis and facilitated glycogenesis and
resulted in reduction of glucose concentrations(37,38). As a result,
the amount of insulin that should be secreted to regulate blood
glucose is reduced(38). The HCA isomer (2s,3r) also inhibited
intestinal and pancreatic glucosidase, which reduced glucose
absorption and carbohydrate metabolism and ultimately lowered
blood sugar levels(34). Moreover,Garcinia cambogiamay decrease
intestinal uptake of glucose by releasing serotonin(39).
Effect of Garcinia cambogia on ALT and AST
In this study, we systematically reviewed the effect ofGarcinia
cambogia on AST and ALT levels. Consistent with our findings, an
animal study by Clouatre and his colleagues indicated no change in
AST and ALT in rats who received HCA for 16 weeks(40). Besides, a
clinical study showed AST and ALT levels did not change in
overweight adults who received Garcinia cambogia (containing

1000 mg of HCA per day) for 12 weeks(14). However, Stohs et al.
found that in participants who received 4600 mg of HCA for
8 weeks, the AST and ALT levels decreased significantly
(41).
A recent study has reported six cases that had a rise in AST and
ALT levels associated with weight loss with HCA(42). In an animal
study, Sanchez et al. reported that mice supplemented with
Garcinia cambogia showed increased plasma AST and ALT
levels(43). Discrepancies among studies may partly be due to
differences in age, gender, health conditions, sample size, dose, and
duration of interventions.

Garcinia cambogia on glycaemic control 9
Consistent with our results, evidence has shown that Antichol,
which containsGarcinia cambogia(8% w/w), inhibits cholesterol-
induced fatty degeneration of the liver and changes in the liver
enzymes
(44). Another study revealed the antioxidant property of
Garcinia cambogia could keep the AST and ALT at normal
levels(45).
In the sub-group analysis,Garcinia cambogiaincreased glucose
and insulin levels in the females with BMI≥ 30; however, it was still
in the standard range of healthy humans. In fact, the level of
increasing glucose and insulin was statistically significant, but this
was not clinically significant. Furthermore, the sub-group analysis
based on the duration of the study showed that the administration of
Garcinia cambogiafor more than 8 weeks decreased insulin levels.
Strengths and limitations
Our understanding allows us to say that the current meta-analysis
is the first meta-analysis of the effects ofGarcinia cambogia on
glycaemic control and liver enzymes. Moreover, we assessed
publication bias by the results of Egger’s test, and no evidence of
publication bias was indicated which caused more reliability of our
results. However, our results should be explained cautiously
considering some of the limitations in the present meta-analysis.
Most importantly, few studies were eligible, and the majority of
them had small sample sizes. In addition, the significant differences
in methodology, sample sizes, ages of patients, health conditions,
and countries of participants indicated significant heterogeneity
among the studies.
Conclusion
The findings of this meta-analysis demonstrated that Garcinia
cambogia could be effective in reducing insulin levels when
administered for more than 2 months. However, further well-
designed clinical trials with long-term intervention and different
doses ofGarcinia cambogia, especially in pre-diabetic and diabetic
subjects and patients with liver diseases, are advised to confirm our
results.
