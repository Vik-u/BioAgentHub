Abstract 
Plastics like polyethylene terephthalate (PET) have become an integral part of everyday life, yet 
plastic waste management remains a significant challenge. Enzymatic biocatalysis is an eco -
friendly approach for recycling and upcycling of plastic waste. PET-hydrolyzing enzymes (PHEs) 
such as IsPETase, along with its engineered variants like FAST-PETase, demonstrate promising 
PET depolymerization capabilities at ambient temperatures.  Whole-cell biocatalysts, display ing 
PHEs on their cell  surface, offer high efficiency, reusability, and stability  for PET 
depolymerization. However, their efficacy in fully breaking down PET is hindered by the necessity 
of two enzymes - PETase and MHETase. Current whole-cell systems either display only one PHE 
or struggle with performance when displaying larger passenger proteins like the MHETase-PETase 
chimera. In this work, w e developed a Saccharomyces cerevisiae-based whole -cell biocatalyst 
system for complete PET depolymerization.  Leveraging a cellulosome-inspired trifunctional 
protein scaffoldin displayed on the yeast surface, we immobilized FAST-PETase and MHETase, 
forming a multi -enzyme cluster.  Our whole cell biocatalyst achieved complete PET 
depolymerization at 30°C, yielding 4.9 mM TPA in seven days with no intermediate accumulation. 
Furthermore, w e showed improve d PET depolymerization ability by binding FAST -PETase at 
multiple sites on the trifunctional scaffoldin. This breakthrough in complete PET depolymerization 
marks an essential step towards a circular plastic economy.

Introduction 
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic has become ubiquitous in daily life, finding extensive 
applications in the single-use packaging and textile industry. The annual global PET production is 
estimated to be around 82 million tonnes. 1 However, since only a small fraction of this produced 
plastic is recycled (<20%), PET waste management is a daunting challenge.2 PET can be recycled 
via mechanical, chemical, or biological methods.3,4  Enzymatic biocatalysis is rapidly emerging as 
a green route for plastic waste recycling and could also open up new avenues for ‘upcycling’ waste 
into higher-value products.5,6.  
Over the years, many PET-hydrolyzing enzymes (PHEs) have been identified and engineered for 
enzymatic PET recycling. 7,8.  The mesophilic enzyme, IsPETase, secreted by a gram -negative 
bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis, exhibited PET depolymerization ability at ambient temperatures.9 
Engineered IsPETase variants with improved activity and thermostability have  since been 
developed10,11, with FAST -PETase12 exhibiting superior performance than other engineered 
variants. Whole-cell biocatalysis is a possible approach to achieve PET depolymerization using 
enzymatic systems.  By displaying PET-degrading enzymes on the surface of a prokaryotic or 
eukaryotic cell, promising PET depolymerization performance can be obtained.13–18 The benefits 
of these systems include improved activity due to reduced enzyme aggregation14, reusability, and 
better enzyme stability.  
However, to achieve complete PET depolymerization into its constituent monomers- terephthalic 
acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG), an enzymatic partner MHETase is also required. 9 PETase 
and MHETase work synergistically to completely degrade PET, with MHETase -PETase fusion 
enzymes exhibiting even better performance than free enzyme mixtures. 19,20 Additionally, the 
accumulation of intermediate product mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) in the absence 
of MHETase has an inhibitory effect on enzymatic PET hydrolysis. 20–22 A major drawback of 
existing PETase-based whole-cell biocatalyst systems is their ability to display only one enzyme 
efficiently on their surface.13,14,16 Poor performance18 or incomplete conversion23 is observed when 
larger passenger enzymes like the MHETase -PETase chimera are surface displayed . Thus, 
complete PET depolymerization remains challenging in such systems. 
To achieve hydrolysis of recalcitrant polymers like cellulose in nature, certain anaerobic bacteria 
have developed multienzyme complexes called cellulosomes.24 Inspired by these natural systems, 
artificial, designer cellulosomes have been developed to harness the benefits of enzyme proximity, 
substrate channeling, and synergy, which lead to highly efficient substrate degradation.25,26  
In this work, we developed a Saccharomyces cerevisiae -based whole -cell biocatalyst system 
capable of complete PET depolymerization.  Previous research has demonstrated the excellent 
surface display capability of S. cerevisiae-based systems.27,28 Additionally, the scaffold approach 
provides flexibility, eliminating the need for exhaustive experimental screening to surface display 
enzymes, thus rendering it highly direct .29–31 FAST-PETase and MHETase were bound on a 
trifunctional protein scaffoldin displayed on the yeast cell surface through high-affinity dockerin-
cohesin interactions. We confirmed the scaffoldin's display on the yeast cell's surface  and the 
successful binding of each enzyme onto this scaffoldin.  Subsequently, we assessed the PET

depolymerization activity of this whole-cell biocatalyst and showcased its capability to completely 
break down PET into its constituent monomers , TPA and EG. This work is essential to achieve a 
robust and eco-friendly plastic waste management approach. 
 
Materials and Methods 
Yeast culture and display of trifunctional scaffoldin on the yeast cell surface 
S. cerevisiae strain EBY100 [MATa AGA1::GAL1-AGA1::URA3 ura3-52 trp1 leu2-1 
his3-200 pep4::HIS3 prb1-1.6R can1 GAL] transformed with pScaf-ctf32 was used for the surface 
display of the trifunctional scaffoldin.   
The yeast cells harboring the surface display plasmid were precultured in SDC medium  (20g/L 
dextrose, 5g/L Bacto casamino acids, 6.7g/L yeast nitrogen base without amino acids) at 30°C for 
18h. For the surface display of the trifunctional scaffoldin, the precultured cells  were inoculated 
into SGC medium (20g/L galactose, 5g/L Bacto casamino acids, 6.7g/L yeast nitrogen base without 
amino acids) at OD 600 of 0.5.  These were subsequently  allowed to grow at 20°C for 60h.                     
S. cerevisiae EBY100 without the pScaf-ctf plasmid served as a negative control.  
Expression and purification of PET-degrading enzymes 
Sequences of g ene fragments encoding for dockerins from C. cellulolyticum  (Doc Cc) ,                              
C. thermocellum  (Doc Ct) , and R. flavefaciens  (Doc Rf) were obtained from a previous 
publication.32 Dockerin-tagged FAST-PETase and MHETase were constructed by fusing the 
dockerins at the C-terminus of the protein of interest (POI) separated by a flexible GS linker and 
transformed into E. coli NEB 5-alpha. 
The constructed plasmids, pBbE8k-FAST-PETase-Dockerin Rf ( pBB8-FP-Rf), pBbE8k -FAST-
PETase-Dockerin Cc ( pBB8-FP-Cc) and pBbE8k-MHETase-Dockerin Ct ( pBB8-MH-Ct) were  
subsequently transformed into E. coli SHuffle T7 for protein expression.  The cells harboring 
pBB8-FP-Rf and pBB8 -FP-Cc were inoculated into fresh LB medium  containing kanamycin , 
cultured overnight at 37°C, and then scaled up at the same temperature  until OD600 reached 0.9. 
Subsequently, intracellular protein expression was induced with 10 mM L-arabinose at 
20°C/250RPM for 20h. The cells harboring pBB8-MH-Ct were grown in TB medium and protein 
expression was induced with 1 mM L-arabinose.  
Post-protein expression, the cells were lysed and the proteins were purified by His tag purification 
(HisPur Ni-NTA Resin, Thermo Scientific), followed by concentration and buffer exchange into 
Exchange buffer (50mM HEPES, 100mM NaCl, pH 8 ) using a centrifugal filter. All purification 
steps were performed at 4°C. Protein purity was assessed using SDS -PAGE and quantified using 
Bio-Rad Image Lab software.  Protein concentration was determined using Bio -Rad DC Protein 
Assay.

Enzyme assembly on the yeast cell surface 
Yeast cells displaying the  scaffoldin were resuspended in Binding buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, 100 
mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl2, pH 8). Subsequently, purified dockerin-tagged enzymes were added and 
incubated with the yeast cells at 20°C for 1.5h with continuous shaking. After incubation, the yeast 
cells were washed with 1x PBS to remove unbound dockerins, and resuspended in Binding buffer 
for activity assays. 
Enzyme activity assays on PET 
Amorphous PET film (Goodfellow, ES301445) was used as substrate to test the PET hydrolytic 
activity of the whole -cell biocatalyst. PET films were hole -punched into circular films (6 mm 
diameter) and thoroughly washed with 1% SDS, 20% ethanol , and deionized water prior to use.  
The PET films were added to a glass test tube containing 300μL of yeast cells (OD600 10) followed 
by incubation at 30°C and 250 RPM. Samples were collected periodically to quantify the reaction 
products.  
To terminate the enzyme reaction, the reaction mixture was centrifuged at 10000g for 5 minutes 
to remove yeast cells, followed by heat treatment of the reaction supernatant at 85°C for 20 
minutes. This reaction supernatant was subsequently analyzed using HPLC (detection wavelength 
240 nm) to quantify the formation of  MHET and TPA by comparing  against a standard curve 
prepared using commercially available standards.  
Confirmation of scaffoldin surface display  and determination of F AST-PETase s aturation 
concentration 
To confirm the surface display of the scaffoldin, S. cerevisiae cells displaying the scaffoldin (OD600 
1) were harvested by centrifugation and washed with 1x PBS. The cells were resuspended in 100μL 
Blocking buffer (1xPBS containing 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumi n) and left on a rotary nutator 
for 1h for blocking. This was followed by incubation with the primary anti-C-myc antibody (Myc-
Tag (71D10) Rabbit mAb #2278, Cell Signaling Technology, 1:200 dilution) at 4°C overnight. The 
cells were then washed with 1x PBS and resuspended in blocking buffer, followed by the addition 
of the secondary antibody conjugated to Alexa 488 ( Anti-rabbit IgG (H+L), F(ab')2 Fragment 
(Alexa Fluor® 488 Conjugate) #4412 , Cell Signaling Technology, 1:500 dilution) at room 
temperature for 2h in the dark on a rotary nutator. After incubation, the cells were washed with 1x 
PBS and fluorescence was measured  using a microplate reader  (BioTek Synergy H1) at the 
following wavelengths: λex = 488 nm, λem = 530nm. 
To determine saturation concentration of FP-Rf and FP-Cc on the scaffoldin, equimolar amounts 
of both enzymes were bound to the scaffoldin using the enzyme assembly protocol. S. cerevisiae 
cells (OD600 5) containing the bound dockerins were centrifuged and washed, followed by blocking 
for 1h in Blocking buffer . They were then incubated with the anti-C-His antibody conjugated to 
Alexa Fluor 488 (His-Tag (D3I1O) XP® Rabbit mAb (Alexa Fluor® 488 Conjugate) #14930, Cell 
Signaling Technology, 1:100 dilution) for 1h at room temperature in the dark on a rotary nutator.  
After incubation, the cells were washed with 1x PBS and fluorescence was measured ( λex = 488 
nm, λem = 530nm).

Results and discussion 
Functional display of scaffoldin on the surface of the yeast cell 
A trifunctional scaffoldin, comprised of three cohesin domains from C. thermocellum (Coh Ct),                    
C. cellulolyticum (Coh Cc), and R. flavefaciens (Coh Rf) with a cellulose-binding domain (CBD) 
was displayed on the surface of the S. cerevisiae cell using the Aga1-Aga2 anchor system (Figure 
1A).32 To verify the surface display of the scaffoldin, a  c-myc tag on the scaffoldin was u tilized. 
Upon incubating  S. cerevisiae  whole-cells with fluorophore -conjugated anti -c-myc antibody, 
considerably higher fluorescence intensity was observed in cells displaying the scaffoldin  
compared to  wild-type whole -cells (Figure 1B) , confirming the surface localization of the 
scaffoldin.  
Binding of PET-degrading enzymes on the scaffoldin 
Previous studies have shown that PETase and MHETase work synergistically to completely 
degrade PET . It has  been reported that  higher PETase loading leads to high degradation 
performance and even low MHETase concentrations are sufficient to boost product release  and 
completely convert MHET to TPA.19 Based on this understanding, we hypothesized that attaching 
FAST-PETase at two different sites would allow higher FAST-PETase concentrations than single-
site attachment of FAST-PETase, promoting efficient and complete PET depolymerization. In our 
approach, w e utilized FAST PETase-Doc Rf (FP-Rf) and FAST PETase -Doc Cc (FP-Cc) for 
immobilizing FAST-PETase on the surface scaffold in and MHETase -Doc Ct (MH-Ct) for 
MHETase immobilization (Figure 1).  
We determined the saturation concentration of FAST -PETase on the scaffoldin  by incubating 
equimolar concentrations of FP-Rf and FP-Cc with the yeast cells (Figure S1). This concentration 
of the FAST-PETase dockerin enzymes was used for activity assays on the PET film in this work. 
Meanwhile, when wild -type yeast cells (lacking the scaffoldin) were incubated with all three 
enzymes, we observed negligible TPA formation compared with scaffoldin display cells . This 
observation confirmed minimal non-specific enzyme binding on the yeast surface in the absence 
of the scaffoldin (Figure 2). 
Study of PET depolymerization performance of whole-cell biocatalyst 
Following incubation  of S. cerevisiae  whole cells with the PET film, we quantified reaction 
products in the supernatant using HPLC to monitor MHET and TPA formation. When only FAST-
PETase dockerins were present on the scaffoldin , both MHET and TPA were formed (Figure 2 , 
Figure S2).  
When MH-Ct was present on the scaffold in along with FP-Cc and FP-Rf, we observed complete 
PET depolymerization, yielding only TPA as the enzymatic reaction product, with no MHET 
accumulation detected  (Figure 2, Figure S2 ). This demonstrate s that each enzyme , including 
PETase and MHETase, was active after binding to the scaffoldin , and the PETase-MHETase pair 
was able to completely depolymerize PET with no intermediate accumulation. As expected, MH-
Ct alone did not show any activity on the PET film (data not shown).

On Day 4, the scaffoldin-displaying yeast cells bound with FP-Rf and MH-Ct exhibited better 
performance than their FP-Cc and MH-Ct counterpart (Figure 2A). This difference in performance 
could be attributed to variance in enzyme localization and access to plastics. We also explored the 
effect of having FAST-PETase at two sites (with MHETase at one site) on the scaffoldin, aiming 
to further enhance the concentration of FAST-PETase in the depolymerization reaction. The three-
enzyme system exhibited  up to 1.63 times  better depolymerization performance than the two -
enzyme counterparts throughout Day 4, with mean TPA yields of 2013 µM. 
It was observed that the  total product formation was significantly boosted when MH -Ct was co-
immobilized with FP-Rf and FP-Cc on the scaffoldin (Figure 2A, 2B). This could be attributed to 
the inhibitory effect of MHET accumulation in the absence of MHETase, which has been shown 
to have a detrimental impact on PETase activity.20,21 
Throughout Day 7 (Figure 2B), the whole cells remained active, with at least a 2-fold increase in 
TPA production relative to Day 4 . Notably, b inding of  FAST-PETase at multiple sites  (with 
MHETase at one site) on the scaffoldin proved extremely beneficial, resulting in a 1.4-fold increase 
relative to FP-Rf (with MH-Ct) and a 1.8-fold increase relative to FP -Cc (with MH-Ct). A mean 
yield of 4.9 mM TPA was obtained after 7 days of incubation with the PET film when all three 
enzymes were bound to the scaffoldin . With these results, we  successfully demonstrated the 
advantages of immobilizing FAST-PETase at multiple sites on the scaffoldin for efficient and 
complete PET depolymerization. 
 
Conclusion 
We developed an S. cerevisiae based whole-cell biocatalyst capable of fully depolymerizing PET 
into its constituent monomers, TPA and EG.  The PET-degrading enzymes , FAST-PETase and 
MHETase, were immobilized on the surface of the yeast cell by binding to a trifunctional scaffoldin 
displayed on the yeast surface in a highly  site-specific manner. TPA yields of 4.9 mM were 
achieved in 7 days at 30°C, with no observed accumulation of reaction intermediates. The 
attachment of FAST-PETase at two sites on the trifunctional scaffoldin proved advantageous, as 
PETase is required in excess compared to MHETase in the enzymatic PET depolymerization 
process. 
The produced TPA and EG can be reused by both chemical and biological methods.  They can 
facilitate the regeneration of virgin PET, enabling closed-loop PET recycling.12 Additionally, these 
products can be repurposed into various value-added chemicals and bioplastics  using alternative 
biocatalysts.2,33,34 Thus, this PET depolymerization approach could pave the way for a circular 
plastic economy.

Figure S1:   Determination of saturation concentration of yeast scaffoldin (OD 600 5) after 
incubation with equimolar concentrations of FP-Cc and FP-Rf. The x-axis represents total FAST-
PETase concentration. Fluorescence intensity was determined after incubation with anti -C-His 
antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488.  Experiments were conducted in triplicates, data shown 
are mean values (± standard deviation). Error bars smaller than size of symbol are not visible.
