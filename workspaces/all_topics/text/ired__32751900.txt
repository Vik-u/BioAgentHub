Abstract: NADPH-dependent imine reductases (IREDs) are enzymes capable of enantioselectively
reducing imines to chiral secondary amines, which represent important building blocks in the
chemical and pharmaceutical industry. Since their discovery in 2011, many previously unknown
IREDs have been identiﬁed, biochemically and structurally characterized and categorized into families.
However, the catalytic mechanism and guiding principles for substrate speciﬁcity and stereoselectivity
remain disputed. Herein, we describe the crystal structure ofS-IRED-Ms from Mycobacterium smegmatis
together with its cofactor NADPH.S-IRED-Ms belongs to theS-enantioselective superfamily 3 (SFam3)
and is the ﬁrst IRED from SFam3 to be structurally described. The data presented provide further
evidence for the overall high degree of structural conservation between diﬀerent IREDs of various
superfamilies. We discuss the role of Asp170 in catalysis and the importance of hydrophobic
amino acids in the active site for stereospeciﬁcity. Moreover, a separate entrance to the active site,
potentially functioning according to a gatekeeping mechanism regulating access and, therefore,
substrate speciﬁcity is described.

1. Introduction
Ever since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued regulatory guidelines for the
development of stereoisomeric drugs in 1992 [1], the search for a cost-eﬀective (and in recent history
also preferably ecologically sustainable) way to generate enantiomerically pure compounds has
become a primary concern for the pharmaceutical industry. Beginning with (S)-(+)-Ibuprofen in 1994,
many chirally switched or de novo synthesized enantiomerically pure drugs have been introduced
into the market, leading to 44% of FDA-approved small-molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients
(APIs) in 2015 containing one or more chiral centers [2].
Chiral amines are ubiquitously present in nature and among them, secondary amines play an
important role. For example, heterocyclic, sulfur-containing amines, in particular 3-thiazolidines,
are used in a broad spectrum of pharmaceuticals, most notably as intermediates in the synthesis
of β-lactam antibiotics, but also in compounds with anti-inﬂammatory, antiviral or anti-cancerous
eﬀects [3,4]. Consequentially, the asymmetric synthesis of chiral secondary amines has also become
one major focus of the industry and many chemical methods to achieve this goal based on the
reduction of the C =N bond exist, for example the asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral imines
Biomolecules 2020, 10, 1130; doi:10.3390/biom10081130 www.mdpi.com /journal/biomolecules

with transition metal catalysts or stable organic hydrogen donors [5,6]. These methods often su ﬀer
from major drawbacks like high costs due to the need for higher amounts of expensive catalysts
and hazardous reaction conditions. Furthermore, 3-thiazolidines proved to be all but inaccessible by
established reduction technologies as of yet, those failing because of catalyst-poisoning, low reactivity,
undesired ring-opening of the product or low enantioselectivity and yields [7,8].
In search for reliable and more environmentally friendly methods applicable under milder
conditions, biocatalytic approaches have been increasingly pursued after the discovery of enzymes
capable of catalyzing the asymmetric reduction of C=N bonds, most prominently the Candida albicans
dihydrofolate reductase [9]. In the early 2010s, Mitsukura et al. discovered, puriﬁed and characterized
NADPH-dependent imine reductases (IREDs) from Streptomyces strains, a new enzyme class capable
of the conversion of heterocyclic prochiral imines to chiral amines with high enantioselectivity [10,11].
Based on their results, extensive data mining based on sequence similarity revealed hundreds of new,
previously unknown IREDs [ 12]. Crystallographic studies so far indicate a close similarity in the
overall structure of these enzymes. They consist of an N-terminal Rossmann-fold and a C-terminal
helical domain, connected by a long interdomain helix, and constitute a catalytically active dimer by
reciprocal domain sharing [13–19].
In our recent study we examined several IREDs for their capability of reducing sulfur-containing
heterocyclic imines, mainly diﬀerent 3-thiazolines and 2H-1,4-benzothiazines. Out of all the IREDs
we tested, the S-enantioselective IRED from Mycobacterium smegmatis (S-IRED-Ms), a member of the
IRED superfamily 3 (SFam3) ﬁrst characterized by Wetzl et al. in 2015 [20,21], proved to be the only
one capable of reducing both 3-thiazolines and 2H-1,4-benzothiazines with promising activity and
excellent enantioselectivity [22].
With the prospect of using IREDs as a broadly applicable reduction platform for heterocyclic imines
in general, substrate promiscuity with retained enantioselectivity is a desirable property, but for further
optimization of the system a deeper understanding of the underlying structural factors inﬂuencing
substrate speciﬁcity and enantioselectivity is necessary. In order to further elucidate this, we present a
high-resolution crystal structure of S-IRED-Ms together with its cofactor NADPH, the ﬁrst published
structure of an SFam3 IRED.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Expression of S-IRED-Ms
The imine reductase fromMycobacterium smegmatis (S-IRED-Ms) was expressed inE. coli BL21(DE3)
according to a literature-known procedure [ 21,22]. A preculture of E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying the
recombinant plasmid with the gene coding for S-IRED-Ms was cultivated overnight at 37 ◦C in 10 mL
lysogeny broth (LB) medium containing 100 µg/mL carbenicillin. The main culture (6 times 300 mL
autoinduction (AI) medium containing 100 µg/mL carbenicillin) was inoculated with the preculture to
a ﬁnal concentration of 1% and cultures were incubated for 2 h at 37◦C and 180 rpm, and afterwards at
15 ◦C and 180 rpm for 60–70 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000×g and 4 ◦C for 30 min
and then resuspended in 3 mL 50 mM KP i pH 7.0 containing 20 mM imidazole and 300 mM NaCl
per gram of wet cell weight. Cell disruption was performed by homogenisation with the homogenizer
EmulsiFlex-C5 (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada) at a pressure of 1000–1500 bar in 3 cycles and the crude
extract was obtained as supernatant after centrifugation at 20,000×g and 4 ◦C for 30 min.
2.2. Protein Puriﬁcation
Nickel-nitriloacetic acid (Ni-NTA) aﬃnity chromatography was performed as ﬁrst puriﬁcation
step. The gravity ﬂow column was packed with Ni-NTA (6–7 mL), washed with 25 mL of Milli-Q ®
water (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and then equilibrated with 25 mL of washing buﬀer I (50 mM
KPi pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole). Crude cell extract (up to 20 mL) was loaded onto the
column, resuspended with the column material and incubated for 5 min. The column was washed
Biomolecules 2020, 10, 1130 3 of 13
with 25 mL of washing bu ﬀer I and then 50 mL of washing bu ﬀer II (50 mM KP i pH 7.0, 300 mM
NaCl, 40 mM imidazole). The S-IRED-Ms was eluted with 10 mL of elution buﬀer (50 mM KPi pH 7.0,
300 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole). The elution fraction was concentrated to a volume of 2.5 mL using
a Vivaspin ultraﬁltration column with a molecular weight cut-oﬀ of 20 kDa. Desalting was performed
with PD-10 columns (GE Healthcare, Berlin, Germany) equilibrated with 50 mM KPi pH 7.0 according
to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Anion-exchange chromatography using the HiLoad 26/10 Q-Sepharose High Performance column
and the ÄKTA ™ system (GE Healthcare) was performed with 50 mM KPi pH 7.0 and a salt gradient of
0 to 1 M NaCl over 10 column volumes.
Size exclusion chromatography was performed with 10 mM HEPES pH 7.0 using the Superdex
200 Increase 10/300 GL column and the ÄKTA ™ system (GE Healthcare). The S-IRED-Ms fraction was
concentrated using a Vivaspin ultraﬁltration column (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany) with a molecular
weight cut-oﬀ of 20 kDa. The concentration of the puriﬁed enzyme ( ε= 19,480 M−1 cm−1) was
determined spectrophotometrically and the success of the puriﬁcation over the three steps was checked
by SDS-PAGE (Figure S9). The homogeneity of the puriﬁed protein was assessed and veriﬁed by mass
spectrometry, withm/z calculated for S-IRED-Ms to be [M]+: 30,996.81 and found to be 30,996.94.
2.3. Protein Crystallization
Apo-S-IRED-Ms as well as holo-S-IRED-Ms with 5 mM of either NADP+ or NADPH were mixed
with 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM iodoacetamide for protease inhibition, centrifuged for 30 min at 31,500×g
and then subjected to broad crystallization trials using a range of commercially available screens.
No crystals were obtained for apo-S-IRED-Ms. Initial holo-S-IRED-Ms crystals grew with NADPH
at a protein concentration of 10 mg/mL in an optimized crystallization condition A8 of the JCSG+ suite
by QIAGEN (0.2 M sodium formate, 20% (w/v) PEG 3350) in a sitting drop setup with 200 nL protein
and 100 nL reservoir solution at 4 ◦C. Larger crystals for diﬀraction experiments were obtained after
one week at the same protein concentration and temperature in an optimized sitting drop setup with
2 µL protein and 1 µL reservoir solution consisting of 20% (w/v) PEG 3350 and 0.2 M sodium formate.
Crystals were cryoprotected in modiﬁed reservoir solution containing 22 % ( w/v) PEG 3350, 0.2 M
sodium formate and 20% glycerol and ﬂash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.
Co-crystallization of holo- S-IRED-Ms with 5–25 mM of various substrates diluted in DMSO
(end-concentration 5%) (Table S1) yielded crystals in a wide variety of conditions at 4◦C in a sitting
drop setup with 200 nL protein and 100 nL reservoir solution, both with NADP + as well as with
NADPH. While co-crystallization with NADPH tended to produce larger, more regularly shaped
crystals faster, NADP+-containing crystals were generally of equal diﬀraction quality.
Crystals for anomalous data collection were grown at a protein concentration of 10 mg/mL with
5 mM NADP+ and either 5 mM 3-TZ in crystallization condition F5 of the high molecular weight
mix PEG smear screen (as described in [23]) or 5 mM BT in crystallization condition H8 of the JCSG+
suite (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) (0.2 M sodium chloride, 0.1 M Bis-Tris pH 5.5, 25 % ( w/v) PEG
3350). Crystals were cryoprotected in reservoir solution containing 10 % (v/v) PEG and ﬂash-frozen in
liquid nitrogen.
2.4. Data Collection, Processing and Structure Determination
The native synchrotron MX data for holo-S-IRED-Ms with NADPH were collected at beamline
P13 operated by EMBL Hamburg at the PETRA III storage ring (DESY, Hamburg, Germany) [ 24].
The data were indexed and integrated with the XDS package and scaled to a cut-oﬀ resolution of 1.55 Å
with AIMLESS from the CCP4 package [25–27]. The structure was solved by molecular replacement
with Phaser and improved with Phenix Autobuild [28,29]. First, based on solvent content analysis,
ﬁve copies of an ensemble of the Rossmann fold containing domain of three homologous IREDs
(Protein Data Bank (PDB) IDs: 5G6R [17], 3ZGY [13], 4D3S [15]) were placed. Then, two copies of an
ensemble of theα-helical domain of three homologous IREDS (PDB IDs: 5G6R, 3ZGY, 4OQY [14]) could
Biomolecules 2020, 10, 1130 4 of 13
be placed sequentially. The three remaining copies of the α-helical domain were placed manually by
superposition onto symmetry mates. After rigid body and restrained reﬁnement with phenix.reﬁne [30],
the electron density was deﬁned well enough for rebuilding the model in place with the correct amino
acid sequence with Phenix AutoBuild [29], greatly improving the free R-factor by 15 % in the process.
Subsequently, ﬁve copies of NADPH could be placed in the resulting Fo-Fc diﬀerence density with
Phenix LigandFit [ 31]. Several rounds of rebuilding and structure validation were performed in
Coot [32], followed by rigid body-, coordinate-, TLS-, occupancy- and individual B-factor-reﬁnements
in phenix.reﬁne and Refmac5 [33].
Anomalous diﬀraction data for holo-S-IRED-Ms with NADPH and either 3-TZ or BT were collected
at an energy of roughly 6 keV (wavelengths of 1.9074 Å to 2.0664 Å) on beamline BL14.2 at the BESSY II
electron storage ring operated by the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin [34], indexed and integrated with the
XDS package and scaled with AIMLESS to a cut-oﬀ resolution of 2.14 Å for the 3-TZ dataset and 2.40 Å
with for the BT dataset. The structures were solved by molecular replacement with Phaser, using one
monomer from the previously solved S-IRED-Ms but without the cofactor NADPH as the initial search
model (PDB ID: 6SMT). Cofactor placement, model completion, validation and reﬁnement were per
performed analogously to the native dataset. Data collection and reﬁnement statistics are reported in
Table 1. Figures were generated with PyMOL (Schrödinger, New York, NY, USA).

3.1. Overall Structure of S-IRED-Ms and Dimer Formation
Initially, we tried to crystallize the S-IRED-Ms (Protein identiﬁer: WP_011731218.1) in the absence
of the cofactor NADPH, but these attempts failed to produce di ﬀracting crystals regardless of the
presence of substrates. Diﬀraction-quality crystals were obtained from co-crystallization with NADPH
or NADP+ alone or with cofactor and one of the various substrates that we had available (Table S1).
The S-IRED-Ms structure presented here (PDB ID: 6SMT) at 1.55 Å resolution was crystallized
with NADPH and featured the canonical homodimeric assembly with ﬁve monomers (A–E) in the
asymmetric unit, arranged as two pairs of dimers (A–B and C–D) and the ﬁfth monomer (E) forming a
dimer with its symmetry mate (Figure 1).

Figure 1. Overall structure of S-IRED-Ms. S-IRED-Ms, depicted in cartoon representation, shows the 
canonical dimeric domain-swapped structure. Helices of monomer A of the dimer are colored and 
labeled in blue, β-sheets in red, loops and turns in light pink. Monomer B is colored in light orange. 
The cofactor NADPH is depicted as stick model in gray.

labeled in blue, β-sheets in red, loops and turns in light pink. Monomer B is colored in light orange.
The cofactor NADPH is depicted as stick model in gray.
The model is of high quality (Table 1) and is mostly complete with the only poor density regions
not modeled being the N-terminal methionine, hexahistidine-tag and one (A, B, E) or two (C, D)
threonines and the last one (B) to four (A, C-E) amino acids of the C-terminus.
The S-IRED-Ms monomer, represented by subunit A, consists of an N-terminal Rossmann-fold
domain of 160 amino acids (9–169) and a C-terminal helical domain (201–294) connected by a long
interdomain helix (170–200). The N-terminal domain consists of a mixed eight-stranded β-sheet
interspersed in sequence and encapsulated by six α-helices. The C-terminal domain is comprised of
the end of the interconnecting helix and a further four helices (Figure 1 and Figure S1). The dimers are
Biomolecules 2020, 10, 1130 6 of 13
generated by reciprocal domain swapping, where the end of N-terminal domain A, the interdomain
helix α7 protrudes and inserts through a hydrophobic channel in the C-terminal domain of chain B
(Figure S2) to then emerge and continue as the C-terminal helical domain of A, which contacts the
N-terminal domain of subunit B.
Surface-exposed reciprocal salt bridges between R165 (chain A, helix α7) and E200 (chain B,
helix α8) at the N-terminal side and between D96 (chain A, loop connecting strand β5 and helix α5)
and H244 (chain B, helix α9) as well as a buried salt bridge between D175 (chain A, helix α7) and H186
(chain B, helix α7) at the C-terminal side of the interdomain helix further stabilize the dimer (Figure S3),
resulting in a large contact area of 4076 Å 2 on average per monomer, calculated with the ‘protein
interfaces, surfaces and assemblies’ service PISA (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/prot_int/pistart.html) [35].
3.2. NADPH-Binding Site
The cleft formed between the Rossmann-fold domain of subunit A and the helical domain of
subunit B constitutes the active site of S-IRED-Ms and is a large channel at the dimer interface with
two separate openings, presumably for individual binding of NADPH and a substrate, respectively.
The electron density obtained after molecular replacement allowed for unequivocal placement of ﬁve
NADPH molecules in the asymmetric unit, one in each S-IRED-Ms monomer active site. Albeit not
strictly planar, angles in the nicotinamide rings indicate a mixture of NADPH and NADP + in the
crystal heavily favoring the reduced form of the cofactor.
The NADPH entrance is situated next to the loop connecting helix α1 to β-strand β1.
Apart from hydrogen bonds to S232 and S237, NADPH only interacts with the N-terminal domain.
The ribose-2′-phosphate of the adenosine moiety contacts N34, R35, the side-chain and the peptidic
NH of T36 and K39, the 3′-ribose hydroxyl interacts with N34 and the peptidic NH of L12 and the
ether-oxygen contacts the peptidic NH of V69. The 3′-ribose hydroxyl of the nicotinamide nucleotide
interacts with the backbone of S95, V68 and V69, while its 5′-phosphate contacts the peptidic NH of
M15 (Figure 2a). The nicotinamide ring is held in place by interactions with S232 and stacks against M15
with its si-face presented to the presumed substrate-binding area of the active site. The characteristic
GXGXXG consensus sequence for NADPH binding is present as G(11)LGPMG(16) [36].
Calculation of the electrostatic surface potential with the APBS [37] Tool 2.1 plugin in PyMOL
revealed that while some of the residues that bind the adenosine moiety of NADPH and its
2′-phosphorylated ribose are positively charged and the cofactor binding site displays a positive
electrostatic surface potential, an overwhelmingly negative potential can be observed in the rest of the
channel after the diphosphates leading to the substrate binding site and in the site (Figure 2b).
3.3. Substrate-Binding Site
The second entrance to the active site in S-IRED-Ms, situated between the loop connecting the
β-strands β6 and β7 of one S-IRED-Ms monomer and the loop connecting α-helices α8 and α9 as well
as helix α8 itself of the other monomer is characterized by a strongly negative electrostatic surface
potential, largely due to D125, E218 and possibly to a lesser extent P214 and S232 outlining the entrance
(Figure 3a).
Interestingly, diﬀraction quality crystals could only be obtained with cofactor present in the
crystallization cocktail. We observed positive di ﬀerence electron density inside the active site of
the enzyme at a position equivalent to that of substrate molecules in other IRED structures in the
literature [16–19], which was of a similar shape in all the crystal structures we obtained, independent
of whether we used NADPH or NADP+, which substrate or cryoprotectants we used or if we utilized
soaking or co-crystallization methods (Figure S4).

of chain B (Figure S2) to then emerge and continue as the C-terminal helical domain of A, which 
contacts the N-terminal domain of subunit B. 
Surface-exposed reciprocal salt bridges between R165 (chain A, helix α7) and E200 (chain B, helix 
α8) at the N-terminal side and between D96 (chain A, loop connecting strand β5 and helix α5) and 
H244 (chain B, helix α9) as well as a buried salt bridge between D175 (chain A, helix α7) and H186 
(chain B, helix α7) at the C-terminal side of the interdomain helix further stabilize the dimer (Figure 
S3), resulting in a large contact area of 4076 Å² on average per monomer, calculated with the ‘protein 
interfaces, surfaces and assemblies’ service PISA  (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/prot_int/pistart.html) 
[35].

subunit B constitutes the active site of S-IRED-Ms and is a large channel at the dimer interface with 
two separate openings, presumably for individual binding of NADPH and a substrate, respectively. 
The electron density obtained after molecular replacement allowed for unequivocal placement of five 
NADPH molecules in the asymmetric unit, one in each S-IRED-Ms monomer active site. Albeit not

The NADPH entrance is situated next to the loop connecting helix α1 to β-strand β1. Apart from 
hydrogen bonds to S232 and S237, NADPH only in teracts with the N-terminal domain. The ribose-
2′-phosphate of the adenosine moiety contacts N34, R35, the side-chain and the peptidic NH of T36 
and K39, the 3′-ribose hydroxyl interacts with N34 and the peptidic NH of L12 and the ether-oxygen 
contacts the peptidic NH of V69. The 3′-ribose hydroxyl of the nicotinamide nucleotide interacts with 
the backbone of S95, V68 and V69, while its 5 ′-phosphate contacts the pe ptidic NH of M15 (Figure 
2a). The nicotinamide ring is held in place by interactions with S232 and stacks against M15 with its

Figure 2. NADPH-binding site of S-IRED-Ms. NADPH, shown as stick model, resides in a highly
conserved binding site. Carbon atoms are depicted in gray, oxygen in red, nitrogen in dark blue
and phosphorus in orange. (a) Apart from hydrogen bonds to two serines in the C-terminal domain
(light blue) NADPH mainly interacts with adjacent residues of the N-terminal Rossmann-fold domain
(light orange) and interactions are indicated by dotted yellow lines. (b) Visualization of the electrostatic
surface potential of the NADPH-binding site displays a positive potential (blue surface) around the
adenine moiety of NADPH and its 2 ′-phosphorylated ribose, while a strongly negative potential
(red surface) can be observed in the rest of the channel leading to the substrate binding site. The surface
of the C-terminal domain, normally partially covering the NADPH binding site, was omitted from the
depiction in order to provide a better view.
Neither the substrate molecules we screened for, nor any of the other substances contained in
the mother liquor could be placed inside this density with conﬁdence. The best ﬁt was achieved with
placement of a 2-ethylhexanol (2-EH) molecule, but we do not imply this to be an actual substrate of
the enzyme. The origin of this component is unclear, but it is known to be a precursor for the synthesis
and also degradation product of the wide-spread plasticizer DEHP [38]. Most known IREDs contain
either a tyrosine or an aspartic acid in a conserved position at the top of the site that is demonstrated to
play an essential role in catalysis [17,19,20]. The corresponding D170 in S-IRED-Ms is located 6–7 Å
away from the apparent substrate position and this distance is bridged via two water molecules at
distances of roughly 2.7 Å and 4.9 Å in between. In addition, subfamily-speciﬁc, highly conserved
residues presumably mediating stereopreference have been identiﬁed in the past [20]. In S-IRED-Ms,
the corresponding residues M121, P123, L174 and F177 are all present within 5 Å of the active site
substrate surrogate 2-EH and oriented towards it. Other residues also within 5 Å of the presumed
substrate position include I120, T122, W178, I208, I211, I215, A233, GE278 and I279 (Figure 3b).

Figure 2. NADPH-binding site of S-IRED-Ms. NADPH, shown as stick model, resides in a highly 
conserved binding site. Carbon atoms are depicted in gray, oxygen in red, nitrogen in dark blue and 
phosphorus in orange. (a) Apart from hydrogen bonds to two serines in the C-terminal domain (light 
blue) NADPH mainly interacts with adjacent residues of the N-terminal Rossmann-fold domain (light 
orange) and interactions are indicated by dotted yellow lines. ( b) Visualization of the electrostatic 
surface potential of the NADPH-binding site displays a positive potential (blue surface) around the 
adenine moiety of NADPH and its 2′-phosphorylated ribose, while a strongly negative potential (red 
surface) can be observed in the rest of the channel leading to the substrate binding site. The surface of 
the C-terminal domain, normally partially coveri ng the NADPH binding site , was omitted from the 
depiction in order to provide a better view. 
Calculation of the electrostatic surface potential with the APBS [37] Tool 2.1 plugin in PyMOL 
revealed that while some of the residues that bind the adenosine moiety of NADPH and its 2 ′-
phosphorylated ribose are positively charged and the cofactor binding site displays a positive 
electrostatic surface potential, an overwhelmingly ne gative potential can be observed in the rest of 
the channel after the diphosphates leading to the substrate binding site and in the site (Figure 2b). 
3.3. Substrate-Binding Site 
The second entrance to the active site in S-IRED-Ms, situated between the loop connecting the 
β-strands β6 and β7 of one S-IRED-Ms monomer and the loop connecting α-helices α8 and α9 as well 
as helix α8 itself of the other monomer is characterized by a strongly negative electrostatic surface 
potential, largely due to D125, E218 and possibly to a lesser extent P214 and S232 outlining the 
entrance (Figure 3a). 
 
Figure 3. Second entrance and active site of S-IRED-Ms. ( a) The opening to the active site cavity
shows a negative electrostatic potential. This is largely due to D125, E218 and possibly P214 and
S232 outlining the entrance. ( b) 2-ethylhexanol (2-EH) was modelled into the active site. 2-EH is
sandwiched by hydrophobic residues like P123, L174, F177, and W178 and also forms two hydrogen
bonds to nearby waters which are part of a wider network inside the active site, further holding 2-EH
in place. Amino acids within 5 Å of 2-EH as well as D170 in the proposed protic position are depicted
as sticks, with the two chains forming the dimer colored in light orange and marine blue. NADPH is
colored in light gray. The 2Fo-Fc electron density of NADPH, contoured at 1 σ, is shown in dark gray.
The hydrogen bonds of the 2-EH hydroxyl to nearby water molecules (red spheres) are indicated as
pink dashed lines.
In some of the datasets we collected from crystals with substrate present in the crystallization
cocktails, 2-EH did not seem to fully explain the density observed in the active site. We therefore
generated polder maps and composite omit maps to reduce the inﬂuence of bulk solvent in phenix,
but no substantial improvement of the density could be achieved (Figures S5 and S6) [ 30,39,40].
We then collected anomalous data of these 2,2,3-trimethyl-1-thia-4-azaspiro[4.4]non-3-ene (3-TZ)-
and 2,2,3-trimethyl-2H-1,4-benzothiazine (BT)-crystals at an energy of roughly 6 keV to visualize
phosphorus and sulfur atoms in order to verify whether the sulfur-containing ligands could be
present with partial occupancy or in diﬀerent orientations due to the size of the active site. While the
Biomolecules 2020, 10, 1130 9 of 13
methionine-sulfurs and NADPH-phosphates were clearly visible, no clear sulfur-signal could be
detected in the active site cavity itself, thereby conﬁrming the absence of the sulfur-containing
substrates (Supplementary Figure S7).
Other groups in the ﬁeld previously described the related enzymes AoIRED, BcIRED and
AspRedAm switching to a closed conformation upon cofactor binding, characterized by a relative
angle-closure between the N-terminal Rossmann- and the C-terminal helical domain and by a loop
restricting access to the NADPH-binding site in their respective crystal structures [15–17], while others
did not observe such movements [13]. Since we did not obtain crystals of apo-S-IRED-Ms, no direct
comparison between the former and the cofactor-bound holo-S-IRED-Ms can be drawn. The state that
holo-S-IRED-Ms was crystallized in could be best described a closed state, resembling the closed state
found in AspRedAm (PDB ID: 5G6S), the reductive aminase most similar toS-IRED-Ms according to the
DALI-Server (http://ekhidna2.biocenter.helsinki.ﬁ/dali) [41], which has a root mean square deviation
(r.m.s.d.) to S-IRED-Ms of 1.3 Å in its closed form and 1.6–1.9 Å in its open form (Figure S8 and
Table S2).
4. Discussion
In the last ten years, IREDs have become a promising target for the development of a
biocatalytic approach to the enantioselective generation of chiral amines via asymmetric reduction of
prochiral imines.
IREDs are structurally closely related to the family of β-hydroxy acid dehydrogenases (β-HADs)
and with NADPH also being the essential cofactor for both [ 20], it was assumed they also share a
similar reaction mechanism where NADPH acts as a hydride donor while a protic amino acid, in most
IREDs either tyrosine or aspartic acid, would act as a proton donor [13].
Hence, two mechanisms have been discussed in the past di ﬀering in the sequence of events.
In Irp3, a thiazolinyl imine reductase from Yersinia enterocolitica, the hydride transfer occurs ﬁrst,
followed by protonation via a general acid residue [42]. However, it has to be taken into account that
the C=N double bond of such substrates is embedded into a imido thioester subunit, which means
that this C=N double bond is more strongly activated compared to the C=N bond of “typical” imines
(Schiﬀ bases) such as the one in the 3-thiazoline considered in this study.
However, the necessity of a proton donor amino acid in IREDs has remained ambiguous to this day.
Mutational studies revealed that substitution for a non-protic residue like alanine in this position can in
some IREDs lead to retained albeit lower enzymatic activity [12,43]. In addition, a wild-type IRED from
Pseudomonas putida with alanine in this position has been described [44], suggesting either the existence
of additional contributing factors in the protonation process or an altogether diﬀerent mechanism.
The second proposed mechanism is based on dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Here, the substrate
is protonated by water and the hydride transfer occurs afterwards, completing the reduction [ 45].
It has thus been speculated that IREDs do not use this position for proton donation but rather for
anchoring and positioning substrate in an optimal orientation and distance to the cofactor NADPH,
since they might operate at a pH value where the substrate is already presented as a protonated
iminium species [ 19]. This ﬁts well with our observations, that in most IREDs in general and in
S-IRED-Ms in particular the electrostatic potential of the active site as well as of the second entrance
to it is negative, which could therefore act in a gatekeeping manner favoring the entry of positively
charged molecules.
Previous ﬁndings indicated that several conserved hydrophobic residues on the sides of the active
site and not the one in the general acid position are responsible for the enzymes’ enantioselectivity.
This is supported by the fact that the S-enantioselective S-IRED-Ms, an SFam3 IRED, shares the
aspartic acid in the general acid position with IREDs from SFam1, which are R-selective, while the
aforementioned conserved hydrophobic residues are shared with SFam2 IREDs, which are also
S-selective like S-IRED-Ms but diﬀer in their general acid residue [20].
Biomolecules 2020, 10, 1130 10 of 13
However, the high substrate promiscuity of these enzymes paired with di ﬀerent substrate
speciﬁcities of IREDs within the same subfamily remains enigmatic. In our previous study, we tested
four other SFam3 IREDs in addition to S-IRED-Ms, and while sequence alignments reveal that residues
around 5 Å of the substrate in the active site seem to be conserved (Figure S1), these IREDs demonstrated
next to no activity on the substrates thatS-IRED-Ms converted readily [22], again indicating the presence
of a potential gatekeeping mechanism limiting access to the active site.
However, only a few of the hundreds of known IREDs have been structurally described, and it
is possible that interactions not yet observed or considered are responsible for IRED reduction
characteristics. To fully understand the catalytic mechanism and its underlying principles, it will
thus be imperative to obtain more structural data with substrates in place, preferably of other SFam3
IREDs. The apparently complex interactions controlling the processes in the active site, the substrate
promiscuity and lack of knowledge with regard to endogenous substrates of IREDs complicate this
endeavor. Therefore, it might be necessary to stabilize the transitional state in which the substrate
is bound to the enzyme in a protonated state and to inhibit the enzyme’s capability to complete the
reduction mechanism in order to limit dissolution of the S-IRED-Ms-substrate complex and stabilize it
for crystallization. This could potentially be achieved by utilizing positively charged iminium ions
which have been demonstrated to be valid substrates before and redox-inactive cofactor analogues
like NADPH 4 which has been used to crystallize the closely related AtRedAm with a synthetic
substrate [18,43]. Another, albeit more complex strategy to understand the role and mechanism of
IREDs could involve identifying their respective endogenous substrates via untargeted and combination
metabolomics approaches [46,47].
