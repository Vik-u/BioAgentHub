ABSTRACT Microbial degradation can provide an avenue for the remediation of plastic 
pollution, contributing to the urgent environmental problem of global plastic waste. 
We demonstrate the degradation of polycaprolactone (PCL) by Clonostachys rosea  and 
elucidate its underlying molecular mechanisms. We constructed the genome of this 
fungal strain and monitored changes in gene expression when exposed to PCL. Twelve 
genes linked to PCL degradation were found in the genome of C. rosea , and some 
of them were upregulated in the presence of the plastic, including genes coding for 
two cutinases. We heterologously expressed the enzymes coded by both genes and 
confirmed their activity against PCL polymers. We also demonstrate that one of the 
enzymes was active against polyethylene terephthalate polymers. Glucose inhibited 
the expression of both genes, completely halting the plastic biodegradation process, 
possibly serving as a preferred and readily metabolizable carbon source compared with 
PCL. We confirm the presence of key metabolic pathways linked to PCL degradation in 
C. rosea, including fatty acid degradation, providing further evidence of the mechanisms 
central to plastic biodegradation.
IMPORTANCE Plastic pollution is one of our most pressing environmental challenges, 
with billions of tons of plastic waste accumulating in our ecosystems. While recycling 
helps, it cannot fully address this crisis, making it crucial to find new solutions. Our study 
reveals how a common soil fungus, Clonostachys rosea, can break down certain plastics, 
specifically polycaprolactone and polyethylene terephthalate. We identified the exact 
genes and enzymes responsible for this ability and showed how different environmental 
conditions affect the fungus's plastic-degrading capabilities. Notably, we discovered that 
adding glucose completely stops the fungus from breaking down plastic, suggesting 
that careful control of growth conditions is essential for effective plastic degradation. 
These findings are significant because they provide a detailed blueprint for optimizing
plastic biodegradation using fungi, potentially leading to more effective ways to tackle 
plastic pollution. This research represents a crucial step toward developing practical, 
environmentally friendly solutions for plastic waste management.

lastic pollution is an urgent global environmental problem due to the extensive 
use and mismanagement of synthetic plastics and their persistence in the environ­
ment. Fish, seabirds, turtles, and marine mammals often mistake plastic debris for food, 
leading to ingestion ( 1–3), which causes gastrointestinal blockages or damages organs, 
for example, by plastic-induced fibrosis ( 4), in some cases resulting in starvation and 
death. Meanwhile, entanglement in plastic debris can cause strangulation, injuries, and 
hamper mobility, reducing survival rates ( 5, 6). Plastic pollution also poses significant

risks to human health. Plastics can release toxic chemical additives, such as phthalates, 
bisphenol A, and polychlorinated biphenyls, which, if ingested, can cause endocrine 
disruption, reproductive problems, and have carcinogenic effects (7, 8).
Conventional management, such as recycling, remains insufficient to address the 
global plastic waste problem ( 9, 10). Consequently, there is a growing interest in 
alternative plastic treatment methods, including biodegradation. Fungi have emerged 
as potential candidates for plastic degradation due to their diverse enzymatic capabil­
ities, including the enzymatic degradation of recalcitrant organic substances ( 11–14). 
Fungal enzyme classes, including laccases, peroxidases, esterases, lipases, proteases , and 
ureases, have shown remarkable efficacy in degrading various plastics under laboratory 
conditions (13, 14), predominantly associated with members of the Basidiomycetes ( 15, 
16) and Ascomycetes (17–19).
Fungal laccases ( 20, 21) and peroxidases ( 22) have shown some potential in 
degrading polyethylene (PE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), two of the most commonly 
used plastics, whereas esterases, such as cutinases and lipases, are effective in degrading 
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) ( 23), polycaprolactone (PCL) (24, 25), and polyurethane 
(PUR) (26). Additionally, fungal proteases have shown potential for polylactic acid (PLA) 
degradation (27). The diverse fungal enzymes involved in plastic degradation highlight 
fungi’s versatility and ability to target different types of plastics.
Despite the progress in understanding fungal enzymatic systems related to plastic 
degradation, identifying new microorganisms capable of efficiently degrading plastics, 
as well as the genetic machinery by which degradation is mediated, is of great inter­
est. Clonostachys rosea  (phylum Ascomycota), a saprophytic filamentous fungus, has 
emerged as a potential candidate for plastic degradation ( 28, 29). Bainier ( 30) was the 
first to characterize C. rosea, previously known as Gliocladium roseum. Schroers et al. ( 31) 
discovered that the morphology, ecology, teleomorph, and DNA sequences from the 
28S rRNA gene of G. roseum  were very distinct from other Gliocladium species, so they 
reclassified G. roseum  as C. rosea . It has been isolated from soil, plants (such as barley, 
onion, strawberry, rose , and cocoa), insects, nematodes, and even wine ( 32–34). This 
wide distribution and ability to colonise different environments highlight the ecological 
flexibility of C. rosea (35).
Understanding the biological characteristics of C. rosea  is crucial for harnessing 
its potential applications, such as for biocontrol and biodegradation. Genomic stud­
ies provide insights into the biology of C. rosea . Its genome contains more than 
14,000 annotated protein-coding genes ( 36, 37), including cell wall-degrading enzymes, 
polyketide synthases, ABC transporters, and monooxygenases ( 38). Two studies have 
isolated and characterized C. rosea strains that can degrade PCL and polyurethane (PUR). 
Barratt et al. (28) found that C. rosea was one of the key fungal strains responsible for the 
degradation of soil‐buried polyester PUR. Urbanek et al. (29) isolated C. rosea strain 16G 
from the Arctic, which exhibited the capacity to degrade 53% of PCL film within 30 days 
at 28°C; a remarkable degradation efficiency even observed at lower temperatures (20°C 
and 21°C). These findings highlight the potential of C. rosea to be an effective degrader 
of plastic waste. Yet, the biological attributes of C. rosea that enable it to degrade plastic 
remain unclear.
We investigated the plastic-degrading capabilities of a strain of C. rosea . This isolate 
is hereafter referred to as C. rosea PCL, in reference to its plastic-degrading capabilities. 
First, we explored the capacity of this strain to degrade an extended range of plas­
tics. After confirming the strain’s ability to degrade PCL, we explored the genetic and 
enzymatic systems that contribute to the PCL-degrading capabilities of C. rosea  under 
various environmental conditions. The findings from this study provide insights into 
the genetic mechanisms, metabolic pathways, and enzymes used for fungi to degrade 
plastics, as well as the environmental variables that influence the plastic degradation 
process.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plastic polymers
PCL and polystyrene (PS) were acquired from Sigma Aldrich (USA; products 440752 and 
331651, respectively). Both PCL and PS were in pellet form and had average molecular 
weights of 14,000 and 35,000 g/mol, respectively. PLA pellets (Ingeo Biopolymer 3052D 
grade PLA) had an average molecular weight of 116,000 g/mol and were purchased 
from NatureWorks LLC, USA. Amorphous PET film (250 µM thick) was obtained from 
Goodfellow Cambridge Ltd (Huntingdon, UK) and cut into 2 mm × 5 mm pieces. PET 
microparticles were prepared from this film by milling under liquid nitrogen in a SPEX 
Sample Prep 6970 EFM Freezer Mill at 10 cycles/s for a total grinding time of 25 min. 
The microparticles were fractionated using an Octagon 200CL Sieve Shaker (Endecotts 
Ltd, UK) through a series of sieves of descending size pores of 500, 355, 125, and 63 µm 
(Endecotts Ltd). Microparticles sized between 125 and 355 µm were used for assays.
Preparation of polymer emulsions
PE liquid emulsions (Aquacer 1063) were a kind donation from ResChem (New Zealand). 
To prepare PCL, PS, and PLA polymer emulsions, 6 g of the respective polymer was 
dissolved in 100 mL dichloromethane (DCM) (Merck, Germany) at room temperature for 
48 h. The solution was mixed with 300 mL of ddH 2O and 1.2 mL of dishwashing liquid 
(Ecostore, New Zealand) and sonicated for 5 min at 50% amplitude, with 1-s ON and 
OFF pulses, using a Q700 sonicator with a 1/2 in. diameter probe (Qsonica, Newtown, CT, 
USA). DCM was then evaporated by stirring at 50°C in a fume hood for 1 h. After DCM 
evaporation, the solution was cooled to room temperature.
Fungal strain and genome characterization
The strain of C. rosea  utilized in our study was isolated in Rotorua, New Zealand, and 
provided by the Scion Research Institute in Rotorua, New Zealand. To isolate DNA from 
C. rosea, we used a PowerSoil DNA Isolation Kit (MoBio Laboratories, Carlsbad, CA, USA). 
First, the fungal strain was grown on potato dextrose agar plates at 25°C for 5 days, and 
then approximately 200 mg of mycelium was scraped off the plate using a sterile loop 
and transferred to a 2 mL PowerBead tube. We followed the manufacturer’s instructions 
for DNA extraction, except for the mechanical lysis step, which was performed using a 
TissueLyzer II (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) for 2 min at 30 Hz.
After extraction, the genomic DNA was cleaned and concentrated using a DNA Clean 
& Concentrator-5 Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA, USA), following the manufacturer’s 
instructions, and the pellet was re-suspended in UltraPure DNase/Rnase-Free Distilled 
Water (20 µL; Cat No. 10977015; Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). 
The quality and quantity of the extracted genomic DNA were initially assessed using a 
Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and agarose gel electrophoresis to 
ensure the DNA was of high integrity and of sufficient concentration for DNA sequenc­
ing. Genomic DNA was stored for downstream applications at −80°C.
Whole-genome sequencing was performed by Auckland Genomics Ltd. (University 
of Auckland, NZ). Auckland Genomics performed library preparation and sequenced the 
sample DNA on an Illumina MiSeq platform using a 500-cycle MiSeq Nano 2 × 250 bp kit, 
as per the manufacturer’s protocols.
Biodegradation assays on plastic-emulsion agar plates
M9 minimal agar was prepared by adding 11.28 g of M9, Minimal Salts, 5× concentrate 
(Merck, New Zealand; product M6030) to 1 L of distilled water and autoclaving for 20 
min at 121°C. Following preparation, the medium was cooled to approximately 50°C. 
At this temperature, the previously prepared polymer emulsion was incorporated into 
the M9 medium at 50 mL of emulsion per litre of medium. The mixture was stirred 
thoroughly to ensure a uniform distribution of the polymer emulsion within the agar

medium. Approximately 20 mL of this medium was dispensed into sterile 9 cm plastic 
petri dishes under aseptic conditions and allowed to solidify at room temperature.
C. rosea was inoculated onto the prepared agar plates' surface by transferring a fungal 
mycelium plug using a sterile cork borer. The plates were incubated at room temperature 
(18–24°C) and monitored daily, visually inspecting for microbial growth and any clear 
“halos” in the plastic emulsion, indicative of plastic degradation. We did not test PET 
degradation using emulsions because PET was insoluble in all the solvents we evaluated.
PCL biodegradation assays incorporating varying carbon substrates
As other studies have found that adding supplementary carbon sources could improve 
the plastic degradation performance of some fungal species ( 39, 40), we tested the PCL 
degradation rates by C. rosea  using different carbon sources. M9 minimal agar plates 
containing emulsified PCL were supplemented with either 1% (wt/vol) glucose, tryptic 
soya agar (Merck, Germany), citrate (Merck, Germany), potato starch (Merck, Germany), 
gelatine (Fisher Scientific, UK), fumarate (Merck, Germany), or cellulose (Sigma-Aldrich) to 
assess their potential influence on PCL biodegradation. Triplicate plates were inoculated 
with agar plugs of C. rosea,  incubated at 25°C for 20 days, and monitored daily for 
signs of microbial growth and PCL degradation. Where observed, clearance zones were 
photographed to quantify the extent of biodegradation under the influence of each 
substrate. Images were processed using ImageJ software (NIH, USA), and the “measure” 
function was used to determine the diameter of the clear zones.
RNA-Seq experiment
To identify the gene expression patterns associated with PCL degradation, we aimed 
to compare treatments in which the PCL degradation phenotype is either present or 
absent. Therefore, noting the inhibitory effect of glucose for PCL degradation by C. 
rosea, we cultured the organism under three media conditions: (i) PCL—M9 minimal 
agar supplemented with emulsified PCL; (ii) GLU—M9 minimal agar supplemented only 
with 1% (wt/vol) glucose (i.e., no PCL); (iii) GLUPCL—M9 minimal agar supplemented 
with both 1% (wt/vol) glucose and emulsified PCL. For each treatment (PCL, GLU, and 
GLUPCL), a plug of C. rosea , previously incubated under the same conditions, was 
transferred to Petri dishes to initiate the culture and incubated at 25°C for 6 days. 
Each of the three treatments was replicated five times, yielding 15 samples. Six days 
post-inoculation, the fungus was collected from each Petri dish using a sterile scalpel and 
transferred into separate micro-centrifuge tubes. These were immediately flash-frozen in 
liquid nitrogen to preserve the integrity of the cellular RNA.
RNA extraction
The preserved C. rosea  RNA was extracted using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, 
Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, with some modifications. Before 
starting, β-mercaptoethanol (β-ME) was added to Buffer RLT at a ratio of 10 µL β-ME per 
1 mL Buffer RLT. Buffer RPE was prepared by adding four volumes of ethanol (96–100%) 
to obtain a working solution.
To extract RNA, 60 mg of flash-frozen fungal biomass was weighed in 2 mL microfuge 
tubes and then subjected to cell lysis. The cell lysis process involved using a pre-chilled 
stainless steel adapter block, 2.8 mm stainless steel grinding balls, and a Geno/Grinder 
tissue homogenizer (SPEX SamplePrep, Metuchen, NJ, USA). Cell lysis was performed at 
1,050 strokes/min for 1 min, followed by the addition of 700 µL Buffer RLT. The samples 
were ground twice at the same rate for 1 min each time and then ground once more 
for 2 min. After grinding, the samples were allowed to thaw at room temperature for 
5 min. The RNA extraction process continued using a Qiagen RNeasy Mini Kit, following 
the manufacturer’s instructions, and eluting in RNAse-free water.

RNA sequencing
Transcriptome sequencing was performed at Auckland Genomics, the University of 
Auckland, NZ. Before sequencing, the concentration and purity of the RNA were 
determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and the 
integrity of the RNA was assessed with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technolo­
gies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Library preparation for sequencing was conducted using the 
Illumina Stranded mRNA Prep Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, 
Inc., San Diego, CA, USA).
Quality control checks were performed on the prepared library using a Bioanalyzer 
2100 to confirm appropriate fragment size distribution, and the library was quantified 
using a Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Normalization and pooling 
of the libraries for simultaneous sequencing were done as required by the sequencing 
facility, and the final pool underwent another round of quality control. The RNA library 
was then sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq platform utilizing a 2 × 150 bp paired-end 
sequencing strategy.
Film weight loss measurements
To confirm that the ability of C. rosea  to degrade PCL is not limited to PCL emulsions, 
we fabricated PCL films by melting the polymer in a 70°C water bath and compressing 
it with glass, resulting in rectangular films measuring approximately 10 × 20 mm and 
weighing close to 0.1 g. Films were sterilized by exposure to 70% ethanol for 30 min. A 
biodegradation experiment was conducted to measure the weight loss of the polymer 
after incubation with C. rosea, using three distinct liquid media conditions: (i) 11.28 g/L of 
M9; (ii) 11.28 g/L of M9 and 4 g/L of yeast extract (yeast extract can frequently improve 
biodegradation rates [ 41]); (iii) 11.28 g/L of M9 and 4 g/L of inhibitory glucose (and no 
yeast extract). For each treatment, four replicates and two control flasks were prepared 
(i.e., containing only the media, with no fungal inoculation). In each 600 mL Erlenmeyer 
flask, 100 mL of the specific medium was introduced. An actively growing plug of C. rosea 
mycelium was added to each flask (except for the control samples), incubated for 180 
days at 28°C, and agitated at 150 RPM.
Fungal mycelia were removed from the plastic films using sterile tweezers. The plastic 
films were then sterilized using a 70% ethanol solution for 10 min, followed by three 
rinses in sterile distilled water to remove residual ethanol and air-drying under a sterile 
laminar flow hood.
For scanning electron microscopy (SEM) imaging, sections of the plastic films were 
cut and attached to aluminum stubs using adhesive carbon tabs  and sputter coated with 
12 nm of chromium before examination using a JEOL 6700F field emission SEM at an 
accelerating voltage of 3 kV before examination at 1,000× magnification.
Heterologous expression and protein purification
Two genes encoding the putative cutinases g9562 and g16887, upregulated in the 
presence of PCL, were synthesised and cloned into pET-28a(+)-TEV plasmids by 
GenScript Biotech PTE Ltd. (Singapore). The cutinase genes were cloned in the NdeI/
EcoRI restriction enzyme sites of the plasmid, with the expressed protein containing 
an N-terminal hexa-histidine affinity tag and recombinant tobacco etch virus protease 
recognition site (rTEV). The plasmids (3 µL) were inserted via transformation into SHuffle 
T7 chemically competent Escherichia coli cells (New England Biolabs, Auckland, NZ) using 
a standard heat shock protocol. The transformed cells were plated on LB kanamycin 
plates and incubated for 24 h at 30°C. A single colony was cultured overnight in 10 mL 
of LB broth supplemented with kanamycin at 30°C and then transferred to 2 L baffled 
culture flasks containing 1 L of LB broth medium supplemented with kanamycin. The 
cultures were grown at 30°C with shaking to an OD 600nm of ~0.8 before induction with 
0.3 mM isopropyl- β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). The cultures were transferred to 
18°C and incubated for 16 h before harvesting by centrifugation (15 min, 4,000 g). The

cell pellet was re-suspended in 30 mL lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 
10 mM imidazole, and 0.5 mM TCEP) supplemented with complete protease inhibitor 
cocktail mini tablets (EDTA-free; Roche), transferred to 50 mL falcon tubes and stored at 
−20°C.
Cell pellets were lysed using a cell disruptor (Constant Cell Disruption Systems) at 
124 kPa, and the lysate was clarified by centrifugation at 30,000 × g for 20 min at 4°C. 
The soluble portion was passed through a 5 mL IMAC column (HiTrap) pre-equilibrated 
with lysis buffer and bound protein washed with wash buffer (50 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 
300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole). The recombinant protein was eluted in a linear gradient 
with elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, and 500 mM imidazole) and 
analysed by SDS-PAGE to estimate purity.
The pure recombinant protein was pooled, and the buffer was exchanged into PBS. 
Briefly, the protein sample was concentrated to 1 mL in a 10-kDa-molecular-weight-
cutoff protein concentrator (VivaScience), re-suspended with PBS buffer and reconcen­
trated. This was repeated twice to replace the elution buffer with PBS. Final protein 
concentrations were determined by measuring the absorbance of the samples at a 
wavelength of 280 nm using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Enzyme kinetics
An enzyme kinetics experiment was conducted using the absorbance method published 
by Zhong-Johnson et al. ( 42). Briefly, 5 mg of PET powder and films were incubated in 
2.5 mL of PBS buffer with varying enzyme concentrations: 50, 100, 150, and 200 nM. The 
samples were incubated for 5 days on a shaking rack at 100 rpm and a temperature 
of 30°C. Afterward, 1.5 µL from each sample was assessed using a NanoDrop at a 
wavelength of 245 nm. This specific wavelength was chosen based on the absorption 
characteristics of mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid and terephthalic acid. Control 
samples, incubated with PBS buffer and PET but without enzyme, served as blanks for 
the NanoDrop readings. All measurements were taken in triplicate.
Genome analysis
Before assembly, raw read quality was assessed using FastQC/0.11.7 ( 43). Adapters were 
removed using Trimmomatic /0.39 (44) with the options “PE” and “-baseout trimmomatic 
ILLUMINACLIP:1_trimmomatic/adapt.fa:2:30:10. ” A fasta file, “adapt.fa, ” containing two 
sequences, was supplied as input to Trimmomatic to remove sequences from the TruSeq 
Universal adapter ( AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTT
CCGATCT) and TruSeq Adapter Index 1 (GATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCTGAACTCCAGTCACA
TCACGATCTCGTATGCCGTCTTCTGCTTG). Low-quality bases were trimmed using “Sickle” 
(45) with the options “pe --qual-type sanger -l 70. ”
The high-quality reads were assembled using SPAdes/3.13.1 ( 46) with a k-mer range 
of 21–127. To assess assembly completeness, we used BUSCO/3.0.2 ( 47) with the 
Pezizomycotina data set as a reference. The resulting assembly was further evaluated 
using QUAST/5.0.2 (48) to determine N50, L50, and genome size metrics.
To improve the accuracy of the assembly, we used BWA/0.7.17 ( 49) to align the 
raw reads to the assembly, followed by Pilon/1.23 ( 50) to perform error correction. The 
haplotigs in the assembly were identified and removed using “Purge Haplotigs” ( 51). 
Repetitive sequences in the genome were masked using “dustmasker” ( 52) to reduce 
their impact on gene prediction. Finally, we performed gene prediction using AUGUS­
TUS/3.3.2 with default parameters ( 53). The resulting genome assembly was used for 
further studies on this fungus.
The genome was annotated against several databases using BLAST ( 54) and HMMER3 
(55), including KEGG ( 56), UniProt ( 57), Pfam ( 58), and TIGRfam ( 59). Signal peptides 
were annotated using SignalP 5.0 software (60). Additionally, all genome sequences were 
annotated using the InterProScan ( 61) tool with the -goterms flag, retrieving GO terms 
for each predicted protein sequence to investigate the biological significance of proteins 
of interest.

RNA-seq analysis
The quality of the raw RNA-seq reads was checked using FastQC/0.11.9 (43) and MultiQC/
1.13 ( 62). The raw reads were trimmed and filtered using fastp/0.23.2 ( 63) to remove 
low-quality bases and adapters. All parameters were set to their default value, but the 
following: “--trim_front1 9 --trim_front2 9. ”
The trimmed reads were aligned to the reference genome using Bowtie 2/2.4.5 
(64). The alignment file was sorted and indexed using SAMtools/1.10 ( 65). The feature­
Counts program (Subread/1.5.3) (66) was used to count the number of reads mapped to 
each gene. The count table generated by featureCounts was imported into the R/4.2.1 
(67) environment for statistical and differential gene expression analysis. The DESeq2 
package ( 68) was used to identify differentially expressed genes. The R-based topGO 
package was used to perform gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis (69).
Transcripts with putative activity against PCL were identified by submitting the whole 
transcriptome to the webserver of the PlasticDB database ( 70), accessed on December 
2024. The default values were used for the similarity search using the DIAMOND software 
version v2.0.6.144 ( 71) with an e value cutoff of 1e −6 and 30% identity on the amino 
acid level. AlphaFold2 (72) was used to predict protein structures through the ColabFold 
(73) platform with default values. Predicted structures were annotated based on their 
structure similarity against all the data deposited in the PDB database ( 74) using the web 
service PDBeFold (75).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using R Statistical Software version 4.3.1 ( 67) and 
Python version 3.10.12 ( 76). A multivariate analysis assessed the impact of different 
experimental conditions on overall gene expression patterns. Principal component 
analysis (PCA) was conducted using the “prcomp” function in R, focusing on the top 
500 most variable genes to retain maximum variance. Subsequently, we employed 
the “adonis2” function from the vegan version 2.6-4 ( 77) package in R to conduct a 
permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA). The analysis utilized a 
distance matrix based on PCA scores with the default Euclidean distance metric. A total 
of 999 permutations were executed to evaluate the significance of observed differences.
Statistical analyses were performed on two distinct data sets. The first data set 
assessed differences in gene expression values among the three treatment groups: 
GLU, PCL, and GLUPCL. The second data set investigated differences in clear zone areas 
among media types with various substrates. Initially, a one-way analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) was performed to assess overall differences among the treatment groups. 
Subsequently, Tukey’s honestly significant difference (HSD) test was applied as a post 
hoc analysis to identify specific treatment pairs exhibiting statistically significant mean 
differences. The ANOVA and Tukey’s HSD test were conducted using Python with the 
scipy.stats (version 1.10.1; Virtanen et al. [ 78]) and statsmodels (version 0.14.0; Seabold 
and Perktold [ 79]) libraries, respectively. The chosen significance level was α = 0.05 for 
both tests.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Plastic degradation screening
The plastic-degrading abilities of the strain C. rosea  PCL were investigated for four 
different plastic types: PCL, PLA, PS, and PE, emulsified in M9 minimal solid media. PET 
was not used due to its insolubility in all evaluated solvents. After 2 days of incubation, 
C. rosea exhibited a clear degradation halo on PCL-emulsified agar plates, indicating its 
ability to degrade PCL. However, there was no visible evidence of degradation on PLA, 
PS, and PE-emulsified agar plates after 21 days. No microorganism has yet been reported 
capable of degrading all four plastic types tested here. However, by searching the 
PlasticDB database, it is possible to find 36 microorganisms out of 633 in the database 
that can degrade both PCL and PLA (70).

Following the identification of the PCL-degrading abilities of C. rosea , we investiga­
ted whether glucose supplementation affected PCL degradation. In biodegradation 
assays conducted over 18 days ( Fig. 1 ), the M9 + PCL medium alone had a mean 
degradation area of 1,048 mm² (±53 StDev), demonstrating that C. rosea  could grow 
using PCL as a sole carbon source. C. rosea  did not grow on an agar-only medium, 
indicating it cannot use agar as a carbon source. Notably, PCL biodegradation was 
completely inhibited when glucose was added to the growth medium, with no evidence 
of biodegradation observed over 18 days. Additional substrate screening experiments 
examining the effects of various carbon sources on PCL degradation indicated that C. 
rosea with PCL-only medium may be carbon starved (Fig. S1).
The inhibition of PCL degradation in the presence of glucose may be attributed 
to glucose being a preferred and readily metabolizable carbon source compared with 
PCL. When glucose is available, the fungus may not produce the necessary enzymes for 
PCL degradation, leading to the complete inhibition of PCL degradation. This carbon 
catabolite repression is a common phenomenon and has also been reported in the 
literature for other carbon sources besides glucose (80–82).
It is not uncommon to find examples in the literature where the plastic biodegra­
dation of microorganisms is overstated ( 83), with microbes only degrading a small 
percentage of the plastic or degrading synthetically aged plastics. Therefore, we 
confirmed the degradation of solid PCL material, rather than emulsions by C. rosea,  by 
conducting experiments using PCL films. Further, we confirmed the impact of glucose 
on PCL film degradation by C. rosea,  using three distinct liquid media: M9, M9 with 
yeast extract (as a standard growth supplement), and M9 with glucose. Yeast extract 
was chosen as a more conventional growth medium supplement to ensure consistent 
microbial development, as it is frequently shown to improve biodegradation rates ( 41). 
After 180 days incubation at 28°C, C. rosea completely degraded (100%) PCL films in the 
M9 with yeast extract medium. In the M9 medium alone, 59.25% (SD: 7.10%) of the PCL 
films were degraded. In contrast, exposure to the medium supplemented with glucose 
resulted in only a 1.89% (SD: 0.58%) weight loss of the PCL film (Fig. 2).
Whether incubated or not, SEM images confirmed that control samples (samples not 
incubated or incubated without C. rosea ) had a smooth smooth surface morphology. 
In the case of samples subjected to C. rosea  incubation in the M9 glucose medium, no 
discernible differences were observed compared with the control samples, and signs of 
biodegradation were notably absent. In contrast, samples incubated with C. rosea on the 
M9 medium alone showcased a roughened surface characterized by cracks and voids. 
Samples incubated with C. rosea on the M9 yeast extract medium underwent complete 
degradation, precluding their inclusion in the SEM analysis.
Genome analysis
To understand the genetic mechanisms involved in the ability of C. rosea to degrade PCL, 
we sequenced the fungus’ genome. The sequencing of the C. rosea genome resulted in 
8,524,227 paired reads (Table S1). After quality control steps to remove low-quality reads, 
98.75% of reads were retained. This retention rate suggests that reads used in consecu­
tive analyses were of high quality. The size of C. rosea’s assembled genome is 56.8 Mbp, 
with 351 contigs and an average coverage of 31× ( Table S2; Fig. S2 ). This estimation 
aligns well with previous reports of the C. rosea  genome size, which ranges from 55.4 
to 58.3 Mbp ( 36, 84). The N50 metric of 378.5 Kbp compares broadly with previously 
published values for C. rosea genomes of 569 Kbp ( 36) and 790 Kbp ( 37), and indicates a 
highly contiguous assembly. Furthermore, we analyzed the assembled genome to assess 
its content with respect to universal single-copy orthologs from the Pezizomycotina 
subphylum. This analysis verified that the assembled genome encompassed a significant 
portion of the anticipated universal single-copy orthologs. Specifically, 3,116 out of 3,156 
orthologs were identified as present and complete ( Fig. 3A). DNA extraction from fungal 
mycelia targeted the haploid life stage of C. rosea  (85). This was evident in the BUSCO 
results, which showed abundant single-copy genes (3,092 genes) and few duplicates 
Research Article mBio

(24 genes). The BUSCO and QUAST analysis results indicated that the genome assembly 
did not contain any contamination, which was also confirmed by the NCBI FCS (Foreign 
Contamination Screen) pipeline (86).
A total of 17,089 genes were predicted in the genome of C. rosea . Overall, 2,214 
genes (13%) were unannotated, with 14,875 genes (87%) annotated across all annotation 
sources ( Fig. 3B ). The annotation revealed 5,338 signal peptides involved in directing 
proteins to the correct location in the cell through translocation ( 87). Annotation with 
the UniProt and UniRef100 databases gave the highest number of annotations (13,893 
each). The GO annotation of the C. rosea  genome, which provides insights into the 
biological processes, molecular functions, and cellular components, suggests that, as 
most genomes (88), a significant portion of genes encode fundamental cellular activities 
like metabolic and cellular processes, as well as the spatial arrangement within the cell 
(Fig. 3D).
To compare the genome of the C. rosea  strain described here (referred to as C. 
rosea PCL) to other published C. rosea  genomes, that is, strains IK726 and CLO192961 
(NCBI Genome Assembly accession numbers GCA_902827195.2 and GCA_902085965.1, 
respectively), we used the OrthoVenn3 tool ( Fig. 3C ). Out of the total clusters of 
orthologues identified in each strain, there were 14,480 in strain PCL, 15,532 in IK726, 
and 13,934 in CLO192961. In addition, 12,719 clusters were shared among all three 
strains, emphasizing these as core genomic elements underlying the biology of these 
strains. Interstrain comparative analysis revealed varying levels of shared orthologs

deviation values. The ability of C. rosea to degrade PCL in the presence of cellulose, fumarate, gelatine, potato starch, citrate , and tryptic soy agar is shown in Fig.

between pairs of strains. There were 1,583 shared clusters between PCL and IK726, 156 
between PCL and CLO192961, and 1,008 between CLO192961 and IK726. These pair-wise 
shared clusters indicate that strain PCL is more similar to strain IK726, making strain 
CLO192961 the most distinct among the analyzed genomes. Each strain also had unique 
ortholog clusters: PCL had 22 unique clusters, IK726 had 222, and CLO192961 had 51, 
illustrating genetic diversity among the strains. However, it is crucial to note that if 
the genomes are incomplete, then this observed diversity could be influenced by the 
incompleteness of the genomes.
FIG 2 Biodegradation assay of PCL films by Clonostachys rosea . The fungus degraded PCL completely in the medium with yeast extract (YE), partially in the 
medium with M9 only, and did not degrade any PCL in the medium with glucose. The assay was conducted over a 180-day incubation period at 28°C on M9 
liquid media supplemented with different substrates: M9, M9 + YE (4 g/L), and M9 + glucose (4 g/L), with all conditions replicated four times. The film weights 
were weighed before and after incubation to determine degradation percentages. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was performed on control and incubated 
samples at 1,000× magnification.

Gene expression profiling
Next, we conducted an RNA-Seq experiment to identify putative genes and pathways for 
PCL degradation in C. rosea and the mechanisms for glucose-mediated inhibition of this 
process (Fig. 4A). We cultivated C. rosea for six days on the following solid media: M9 with 
PCL, M9 with glucose, and M9 with PCL and glucose. Next, RNA was extracted (mean RIN

values of 7.04, SD: 1.46), and expression analysis was conducted. A total of 16,807 genes 
had mapped reads. No genes were notably downregulated in the GLUPCL medium (M9 
medium with both glucose and emulsified PCL) compared with GLU medium control 
(M9 medium and glucose), while two genes were upregulated. Thus, adding emulsified 
PCL to the glucose medium did not significantly affect the gene expression profile of 
the fungus. In contrast, there were 1,835 significantly downregulated genes and 2,184
upregulated genes in the PCL medium (M9 medium with emulsified PCL) compared with 
the GLUPCL medium. Similarly, the comparison between PCL and GLU media showed 
1783 significantly downregulated genes and 2228 upregulated genes in the PCL media 
(Fig. 4B), showing that the two treatments with glucose generated a very different gene 
expression profile compared to the PCL-only treatment.
A PCA Biplot showed that samples from the three treatments had compositionally 
distinct gene expression profiles (Fig. 4C). Samples with and without glucose separated

principally across the x-axis, which accounts for a substantial 97.1% of the total data 
variance, further illustrating the influence of glucose on C. rosea gene expression. While 
GLU and GLUPCL samples clustered together on the x-axis, they separated along the 
y-axis. However, the y-axis explained only 0.8% of the total data variance, implying that 
the difference caused by PCL presence was small compared to the effect of glucose 
addition.
As discussed earlier, C. rosea  degradation of PCL was inhibited in the presence of 
glucose. Thus, biological processes upregulated in the PCL treatment compared with 
the GLU treatment may better elucidate the potential degradation pathways of PCL ( Fig. 
5A). Therefore, we performed a GO enrichment analysis and found the upregulation of 
several biological processes, including carbohydrate metabolic process, fucose metabolic 
process, and xylan catabolic process in the presence of PCL and absence of glucose. The 
observed upregulation of carbohydrate and fucose metabolic processes under PCL-only 
conditions might reflect a complex metabolic response, though its precise role remains 
speculative. One possibility is that, in the absence of preferred carbon sources like 
glucose, C. rosea could be activating these pathways to: (i) scavenge alternative carbon 
sources, (ii) support potential cell wall remodeling that might aid in enzyme secretion, 
or (iii) produce precursors that could feed into beta-oxidation pathways involved in 
processing PCL degradation products. These hypotheses suggest that C. rosea  may 
possess metabolic flexibility that potentially allows it to cope with and possibly utilize 
PCL when more favorable substrates are absent.
We also found upregulation of genes involved in aromatic amino acid metabolism, 
such as L-phenylalanine and tyrosine, and catechol-containing compound metabolic 
process. Those upregulated biological processes may indicate that C. rosea may mobilize 
pathways to metabolise the aromatic components produced by the breakdown of the 
PCL polymer, such as ε-caprolactone. We also found several downregulated biologi­
cal processes during PCL degradation, including polysaccharide and inositol catabolic 
processes, proteolysis, and fatty acid biosynthetic processes (Fig. 5B).
The annotation of PCL-upregulated genes using the KEGG database reinforces 
insights gleaned from the GO analysis, identifying numerous genes involved in the fatty 
acid degradation pathway ( Fig. 6 ). Fatty acid degradation, or beta-oxidation, involves 
breaking down long-chain fatty acids into acetyl-CoA ( 89). This versatile metabolite 
feeds into the tricarboxylic acid cycle, generating ATP and reducing equivalents ( 90). 
The upregulation of genes within this pathway in the PCL treatment suggests that C. 
rosea may exploit similar enzymatic machinery to metabolise the products generated 
during PCL degradation. This pathway has also been suggested to play a role in 
plastic degradation by other fungi ( 91). Simultaneously, the presence of genes from 
the fatty acid degradation pathway could indicate a metabolic adaptation for energy 
production under the PCL conditions. In the previous GO enrichment analysis, fatty 
acid biosynthetic processes were downregulated, suggesting that the degraded fatty 
acids likely originate from PCL degradation rather than produced by C. rosea . Fungi 
typically accumulate substantial quantities of lipids within both their hyphae and spores. 
These lipids are crucial as carbon and energy reservoirs, particularly during periods 
of starvation and spore germination ( 92–94). Therefore, with the potentially reduced 
availability of traditional energy sources such as polysaccharides, as suggested by the 
downregulation of polysaccharide catabolic processes in the GO analysis, C. rosea might 
try to compensate by upregulating fatty acid degradation of internal resources or PCL 
degradation products.
Heterologous expression and enzyme kinetics
We identified 12 C. rosea genes as putatively coding for PCL-degrading enzymes by 
annotating all transcribed genes against PlasticDB, a database for genes reported 
to be involved in plastic biodegradation ( 70). Two transcribed genes, g16887.t1 and 
g9562.t1, stood out for being significantly differentially expressed and having high 
expression levels in the presence of PCL, while having an absence of expression in 
Research Article mBio
August 2025  Volume 16  Issue 8 10.1128/mbio.00335-25 13
glucose treatments ( Fig. 7 ; g16887.t1 log 2FoldChange = 13.14; g9562 log 2FoldChange 
= 11.96). These genes were, therefore, considered key candidates for PCL degradation. 
We also searched for these genes within the genomes of the C. rosea strains IK726 and 
CLO192961 using BLAST ( 54) with a cutoff e value of 1e −6 and a minimum  percent
identity of 30% at the amino acid level. Strain IK726 contained all 12 genes in its genome, 
while strain CLO192961 possessed 10.
The expressed g9562.t1 gene was identified by InterProScan as an alpha/beta-hydro­
lase. Based on PlasticDB, it was 66.8% identical to a cutinase from Humicola insolens 
(PlasticDB code: PLDB00121), demonstrated to degrade PET ( 95). Similarly, the expressed 
gene g16887.t1 was annotated by InterProScan as an alpha/beta-hydrolase. Based on 
PlasticDB, it was 68.3% identical to a cutinase from Thermobifida fusca  (PlasticDB code: 
PLDB00073), another fungus reported to degrade PET ( 96). The action of cutinases, 
esterases, and hydrolases in plastic degradation is well documented, particularly due to 
their ability to hydrolyze ester bonds, a key structural feature of many plastics, including 
PCL (97, 98).
To confirm the ability of the enzymes coded by these two expressed genes to 
degrade PCL, we expressed the genes for these proteins in Shuffle T7 Competent E. coli 
cells and purified the resultant recombinant proteins via affinity chromatography. The 
molecular weight (Mw) for recombinant g9562.t1 was 20.0 and 34.1 kDa for g16887.t1. 
An aliquot (1 µL at a concentration of 2 µg/µL) of the purified enzymes was applied 
onto PCL-emulsified agar for 24 h at room temperature (18–24°C) , and clear zones 
were observed for both enzymes, confirming their activity against PCL. The control with 
ddH2O showed no signs of degradation (Fig. S7).
Various studies report that some enzymes capable of degrading PCL also possess 
the ability to degrade PET ( 23, 99, 100). The ability of these enzymes to degrade PET 
was therefore tested by an absorbance method ( 42). Only the enzyme expressed by the

transcribed gene g9562.t1 exhibited concentration-dependent catalytic activity against 
PET, with higher enzyme concentrations leading to increased substrate degradation, 
effectively breaking down PET film and powder substrates over 5 days of incubation 
period ( Fig. 8C). The enzymes coded by the transcribed genes g9562.t1 and g16887.t1 
were deposited in the PlasticDB database as cutinases. g9562.t1 (accession: PLDB00229) 
was deposited with PCL and PET degradation activity, while g16887.t1 (accession: 
PLDB00230) was deposited with PCL degradation activity only.
We used the algorithm AlphaFold2 to predict the structure of enzymes PLDB00229 
(g9562.t1) and PLDB00230 (g16887.t1). Using the predicted structure, we annotated 
both proteins using the PDBeFold web tool. PLDB00229 matched a cutinase from H. 
insolens (PDB: 4oyy; 65% sequence identity). Enzyme PLDB00229 active site is at residues 
SER 131, with HIS 199 and ASP 186 associated residues ( Fig. 8A ). It is in a long cleft 
and likely to accommodate longer polymer substrates. A putative mobile loop near the 
cleft may further expand the space available for substrate binding. Numerous similar 
structures of different cutinases share a similar substrate binding groove, indicating
highly conserved functionality across species.

Enzyme PLDB00230 matched a polyhydroxybutyrate depolymerase from Penicillium 
funiculosum (PDB: 2d81; 69.2% identical) that was shown to degrade PHB and a trimer 
of R3HB ( 101). The enzyme PLDB00230 active site is predicted to be at residues SER 
39, with HIS 155 and ASP 121 as associated residues ( Fig. 8B ). It is situated in a more 
constrained pocket when compared to the other enzymes. This smaller pocket may 
explain why PLDB00230 was only active against PCL, not PET. Furthermore, PLDB00230 
and its P . funiculosum homolog (PDB: 2d81) share nearly identical residues lining the 
substrate binding pocket/groove. This structural similarity suggests that both enzymes 
likely exhibit comparable catalytic activity against polyesters.
Conclusion
Our study demonstrates the plastic-degrading ability of C. rosea , particularly for PCL, 
while also highlighting the significant impact of glucose on this process. The fungus 
could use PCL as a sole carbon source, leading to substantial degradation in both 
emulsified and film forms. However, when glucose was added to the medium, PCL 
degradation was completely inhibited. This suggests that C. rosea  prioritizes metabo­
lizing glucose over producing enzymes required for PCL breakdown, a phenomenon 
consistent with carbon catabolite repression. In addition to PCL, we also demonstrate C. 
rosea’s ability to biodegrade PET, highlighting the influence of substrate composition on 
the biodegradation process. The biodegradation assays revealed that the carbon sources 
present significantly impact the degradation process, with potato starch providing the 
most favorable conditions out of those tested.
We demonstrated that the fungus underwent a significant shift in metabolic activity 
in the presence of PCL. Gene expression experiments highlighted the possible impor­
tance of the fatty-acid biodegradation pathway for plastic biodegradation. The analysis 
of upregulated transcripts against the PlasticDB database revealed two transcripts highly

indicated overall differences. Tukey’s HSD test for overall treatment effects revealed significant differences between [GLU and PCL], and [GLUPCL and PCL] 
treatments, but not between [GLU and GLUPCL] when considering all transcripts collectively. The box represents the range between the 25th percentile and the 
75th percentile of the data. The line inside the box represents the median. The whiskers indicate the range of the data that are not considered outliers. Individual 
data points that fall outside the whiskers are outliers.

expressed under PCL conditions, suggesting their possible role in C. rosea  PCL degra­
dation phenotype. Both transcripts were heterologously expressed, and the produced 
enzymes exhibited activity against PCL, while one of the enzymes also demonstra­
ted activity against PET polymers. The knowledge generated in this study can aid 
in developing more efficient microbiological strategies for plastic degradation and 
recycling by optimizing carbon sources, metabolic pathways, and enzyme activity on 
plastic substrates. Our findings emphasize the promising role of fungi in bioremediation 
and open doors to further research into enhancing the ability of fungi to degrade 
different types of plastics.
