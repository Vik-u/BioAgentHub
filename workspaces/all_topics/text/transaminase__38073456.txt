ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND: Many studies have been done in the literature on perforations due to substance abuse, and there are limited 
publications on perforations related to inhaled methamphetamine. Recently, in our clinic, we observed an increase in the number of 
patients with perforated peptic ulcer, which we think is secondary to a significant increase in the consumption of this drug. The main 
purpose of this study is to determine whether the use of inhaled methamphetamine known as “fire and ice” is a factor directly related 
to peptic perforation and its complications and also to determine the demographic variables of patients with peptic ulcer perforation 
due to this substance use, in the context of the literature. 
METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted by examining the medical records of 29 gastric perforation patients who under -
went surgical treatment in our clinic in 2021. Data were transferred to SPSS.23 (IBM Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) program and evaluated 
with statistical analysis. Normality assumptions of continuous variables were examined with Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, and variance 
homogeneity was examined with Levene’s test. Bi-level comparisons, t-test if the data are normally distributed and Mann–Whitney U-
test for bi-level comparisons where the data are not normally distributed were used. Relationships between categorical variables were 
examined by Chi-square test analysis. P<0.05 was accepted as the level of significance in all analyzes.
RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients were divided into two groups as methamphetamine users (n=13) and non-users (n=16). There was 
a statistically significant difference according to the lower age in the group using methamphetamine (31.69−48.8-P=0.025). The pres-
ence of PU history differed significantly between the groups (P=0.009). Interestingly, aspartate transaminase alanine aminotransferase 
values were lower in substance dependents (P=0.020). Furthermore, there was a significant difference in localization between groups 
(P<0.001). There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in terms of gender, clinical presentation, and other 
laboratory values.
CONCLUSION: Methamphetamine consumption, known as fire and ice, is an important risk factor for ulcer development and sub-
sequent perforation, especially in young patients and long-term consumption of this narcotic substance. It has been determined that 
this risk factor, which is currently considered rare, has been seen in a very large number in a short time in our clinic. The use of this 
substance, which is considered a major social threat, is becoming more and more widespread, and this study is only a small part of the 
iceberg reflected in the general surgery clinic of a hospital.

INTRODUCTION
Peptic ulcer perforation is not exclusive to modern times, 
as its occurrence has been mitigated by the use of common 
preventive drugs such as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). At 
present, there are reports in the literature demonstrating a 
reduction in the incidence of peptic ulcer disease (PUD) in 
first-world countries. Nevertheless, the occurrence of the 
disease and subsequent perforations persist. [1] PUD remains 
the primary cause of stomach perforation. It is estimated

that the incidence of PUD is approximately 1.5–3%, with a 
lifetime prevalence of perforation estimated at around 5%. 
Mortality rates associated with PUD vary, ranging from 1.3% 
to 25%.[2] The development of peptic ulcers is believed to 
result from an imbalance between protective factors, such as 
gastric motility, mucus secretion, and neuronal secretion of 
protective-inducing factors, and aggressive factors such as ex-
cessive secretion, heavy smoking, alcoholism, and prolonged 
acid exposure to the mucosa. However, a systemic cause or 
the mechanism of a local ulcer perforation has not yet been 
determined.[1]
While the use of PPIs and H2 antagonists decreases the in-
cidence of perforated ulcers, it is important to note that the 
effects of tobacco, alcohol, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory 
(NSAIDs), and corticosteroid drugs are the cause of ulcer 
perforation. The two primary factors contributing to its eti-
ology are NSAIDS and Helicobacter pylori.[2] Additional con-
tributing factors include smoking, chronic liver disease and 
chronic kidney failure, and hyperparathyroidism, especially 
during dialysis and transplantation. [2] Apart from the previ-
ously mentioned factors, new factors have arisen due to so-
cial, economic, and demographic changes. Notably, the use of 
illicit substances, particularly cocaine, heroin, and chronic use 
of inhaler methamphetamine, is considered a risk factor.[1,3]
Methamphetamine possesses a chemical structure similar to 
amphetamine, but it has more pronounced effects on the cen-
tral nervous system level. Methamphetamine impacts the cen-
tral nervous system by increasing the release of monoamine 
neurotransmitters, including serotonin, dopamine, and nor -
epinephrine.[3] Individuals who use methamphetamine experi-
ence an acute, strong, and short attack of lasting roughly 5–30 
min, with variations depending on the method of use. This 
substance also causes an increased energy level, suppresses 
appetite, and induces euphoria that can last for 6–12 h.[4]
Methamphetamine is among the most potent central ner -
vous stimulants. “Crystal meth,” the most widely abused il-
legal drug worldwide, is a highly purified form of D-meth-
amphetamine that occurs in crystalline structure. The final 
phase of methamphetamine misuse manifests as paranoia and 
irritability due to severe insomnia, which may persist for a 
duration of 3–15 days. Typically, individuals at this stage es-
calate their methamphetamine intake in a bid to recapture 
the initial euphoric effect. However, since achieving this effect 
becomes increasingly challenging, it often leads to frustration, 
irritability, and indecisive behavior. Importantly, individuals 
at this stage of methamphetamine use become unpredict-
able, potentially engaging in violent acts, instigating family 
disputes, committing impulsive crimes, and posing risks to 
themselves and others. Consequently, caution should be ex-
ercised by individuals in proximity to such users due to their 
unpredictable behavior. Methamphetamine use has been as-
sociated with an increased pain threshold, leading patients 
to disregard symptoms. Abdominal complications resulting 
from methamphetamine use are infrequent and can be easily 
overlooked by clinicians.[4-10]
Recently, we have seen an increase in the number of patients 
with perforated peptic ulcer, which we think is secondary to 
a significant increase in the consumption of this substance, 
in our clinic. The main purpose of this study is to determine 
whether the use of inhaled methamphetamine known as “fire 
and ice” is a factor directly related to peptic perforation and 
its complications, and also to determine the demographic 
variables of patients with peptic ulcer perforation due to this 
substance use, by the guidance of the literature.
MA TERIALS AND METHODS
Data Source and Patient Selection
We retrospectively collected information regarding the age, 
causes, and surgical-clinical management of patients who 
underwent surgery for perforated peptic ulcers at our hos-
pital’s general surgery clinic over the past year (January 1, 
2021–December 31, 2021). Data were obtained through the 
hospital information system and patient interviews. Patients 
with incomplete clinical records or those who did not have 
a complete clinical record and declined to provide necessary 
data in blank format were excluded from the study. In addi-
tion, patients who stated that they used substances other 
than fire and ice (cannabis, heroin, cocaine, bonsai, etc.) as 
anamnesis were also excluded from the study. The evaluated 
patients were divided into two groups: Group A: Consisted 
of patients using methamphetamine, and Group B: Included 
patients who did not using methamphetamine.
Statistical Analysis
Data were transferred to SPSS.23 (IBM Inc., Chicago, IL, 
USA) program and evaluated with statistical analysis. Before 
proceeding to the statistical analysis, controls were made re-
garding the absence of data entry errors and whether the 
parameters were within the expected range. Normality as-
sumptions of continuous variables were examined with Kol-
mogorov–Smirnov test, and variance homogeneity was exam-
ined with Levene’s test. Mean and standard deviation values 
were given for continuous variables, and frequency (n) and 
percentage (%) values were given for categorical variables. 
Bi-level comparisons, t-test if the data are normally distrib-
uted, and Mann–Whitney U-test for bi-level comparisons 
where the data are not normally distributed were used. Re-
lationships between categorical variables were examined by 
Chi-square test analysis. P<0.05 was accepted as the level of 
significance in all analyzes.
Our study received ethical approval from the Ethics Commit-
tee of Gaziantep Islamic Sciences and Technology University 
Clinical Research.
R E SULTS
In the past year, a total of 29 patients underwent surgery with 
a diagnosis of gastric perforation. Among them, 13 (44.8%) 
cases were attributed to the use of “fire and ice” (inhalant 
methamphetamine), while 16 (55.2%) cases were caused by

reasons unrelated to substance use. 10 out of the 13 (76.9%) 
individuals using fire and ice had no prior history of peptic ul-
cer or stomach symptoms, while 3 (23.1%) did have peptic ul-
cer. While no stomach complaints/symptoms were reported 
in these patients, three cases were classified as peptic ulcer 
patients because they had previously undergone surgery for 
the same reason. Conversely, among those people who did 
not use fever ice material, 4 (25.0%) had not peptic ulcer, 
while 12 (75.0%) had peptic ulcer. A statistically significant 
difference was found between peptic ulcer and fever and ice 
substance use (P=0.009). The effect size of this difference 
was calculated as 0.517 (Table 1).
Except for peptic ulcer and gastritis histories, 13 (36.11%) of 
all patients were found to have a history of fire and ice mate-
rial use. One patient (2.78%) had an alcohol addiction and 20 
(68.9%) of them were smokers. Notably, eight of 20 smok-
ers were belonged to the non-substance-using group (50%). 
Among the 13 substance-using patients, 12 were smokers, 
and only one patient reported not smoking (92.3%). NSAID 
use was present in 7 (24.13%) of all patients (all of whom 
were in the group not using METH). Furthermore, 5 (17.24%) 
had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 1 (3.44%) had 
a diagnosis of cerebrovascular disease. One (3.44%) patient 
underwent surgery under the diagnosis of COVID-19. In one 
of the patients who did not use METH, no etiology was found 
except a history of peptic ulcer (Table 2).
The mean age of individuals using fire and ice was 31.69±10.82, 
while the mean age of those who did not use this substance 
was 48.81±20.81. A statistically significant correlation be-
tween substance use and age was observed (P=0.025). It was 
determined that the average age of those who used fire ice 
substance was younger (Table 3).
No statistically significant differences were found in the 
mean day of symptom onset, mean length of hospital stay, 
mean white blood cell, hemoglobulin, neutrophil, C-reactive 
protein, and aspartate aminotransferase values between 
two groups (P=0.948, P=0.531, P=0.471, P=0.410, P=0.449, 
P=0.914, P=0.249) (Table 3). Interestingly, the mean ALT 
(alanine aminotransferase) value was 12.08±3,55 for patients 
used fire and ice, compared to 20.06±11.77 for those not 
using this substance. There was a statistically significant ef-
fect of fire and ice use on the ALT values (P=0.020), with 
higher ALT values observed in those who did not use “fire 
and ice”. (Table 3). No statistically significant differences were 
found between the two groups in terms of the evaluation of

the clinical picture, especially at the time of admission, acute 
abdomen data at the time of admission, and the presence of 
free air in the radiological examination.
All patients using fire and ice were male (100.0%), and there 
was no female patient using this substance. The number of 
male patients who did not use fire and ice was 12 (75.0%), 
and the number of female patients was 4 (25.0%). There was 
no statistically significant effect of substance use on gender 
groups (P=0.107) (Table 4).
In patients using “fire and ice,” peptic ulcers were found in 
various sections of the gastrointestinal tract, with 2 cases 
(15.4%) in the first section of the duodenum, 1 case (7.7%) in 
the second section of the duodenum, 3 cases (23.1%) in the 
pyloric recurrence area, and 7 cases (53.8%) in the pre-pyloric 
region. Conversely, among those who did not use “fire and 
ice, 14 cases (87.5%) had peptic ulcers in the first section of 
the duodenum and 2 cases (12.5%) had them in the pre-pylor-
ic region. In this group, ulcers were not found in the secons 
section of the duodenum. A statistically significant correla-
tion was identified between location ulcers and the use of 
fire and ice (P<0.001) with an effect size of 0.734. In addition, 
peptic ulcers occurred in the pre-pyloric region in those who 
used “fire and ice,” while they predominantly occurred in the 
first section of the duodenum in those who did not use this 
substance (Table 5).
When evaluating additional substance addictions, it was iden-
tified that some of the 13 patients in Group A had a history 
of multiple substance use. However, during the period of this 
study, they solely used “fire and ice” due to its accessibility 
and affordability. Cases of perforation attributed to the use 
of additional substances were excluded from the study, as the 
study exclusively focused on assessing the impact of “fire and 
ice” use.
Regarding surgical procedures, the majority of cases under -
went graham omentoplasty or primary repair + combined 
with omentoplasty. Roux-en-Y gastroenterostomy was only 
performed in the case of duodenal second section perfora-
tion in the first group, which due to pyloric stenosis.
Biopsy was taken intraoperatively in six cases from the first 
group, revealing active inflamed fibrotic tissue as the pathol-
ogy result. In contrast, intraoperative biopsy was not con-
ducted in any case in Group 2. Five of these cases (out of 16) 
in Group 2 attended the follow-up endoscopy appointment 
postoperatively. Strikingly, none of the patients in the first 
group availed themselves of control endoscopy (out of the 13 
cases). In terms of complications, five wound infections were 
observed in the first group, compared to one wound infection 
in the second group.
Regarding mortality, no deaths occurred in Group A, and 
while 2 patients (12.5%) (6.89% compared to the total case) 
died in Group B. One of these patients died due to post-
operative respiratory problems after being operated under 
the diagnosis of COVID 19, and the other patient died due 
to sepsis and post-operative multiorgan failure syndrome in 
the initial presentation.
DISCUSSION
Methamphetamine, commonly known as crystal, “fire and 
ice” or meth among the public, is a colorless and odorless 
substance with a potent strong addictive effect. Despite its 
chemical similarities to amphetamines, methamphetamine 
has stronger effects on the central nervous system. It can be 
consumed through various methods, including snorting, oral 
ingestion, and intravenous administration. Short/long-term 
use of methamphetamine causes circulatory, respiratory, and 
neurological problems, as well as many mental health prob-
lems such as anxiety, aggression, and depression.
The precise prevalence of methamphetamine users in Türkiye 
remains unknown. However, available data suggest that meth-
amphetamine abuse is linked to factors such as age, low edu-

cation level, and use of other psychoactive substances. When 
the published researches and the reports are examined, it has 
been seen that approximately 185 million people in the world 
use illegal substances, and 33.4 million of these people are 
amphetamine users.[11] In this study our clinic, not only treats 
cases of gastric perforation but also attends to numerous pa-
tients injured by a substance user in a family dispute or any 
fight were followed up with surgical treatment.
Based on the findings in this study group, we show that meth-
amphetamine consumption, known as “fire and ice”, is an 
important risk factor for the development of a perforation 
event in an earlier age group than in non-users. Although our 
findings were similar to other reports on the effects of sub-
stance use on peptic ulcer and related perforation, we had a 
lower mean age in terms of age.[1,12]
There was no history of peptic ulcer or stomach symptoms in 
10 individuals (76.9%) who used fire and ice, while 3 (23.1%) 
individuals had PU+. Although these patients did not report 
any stomach complaints/symptoms, pu(+) was confirmed be-
cause they had previously undergone surgery for the same 
reason. In contrast, among patients who did not use fire and 
ice 4 (25.0%) patients were PU- while 12 (75.0%) were PU+. 
A statistically significant difference was found between PU 
and fire-ice substance use. (P=0.009). In other words, there 
was a history of PU in 15 cases in total (51.7%). PUD is the 
leading cause of gastric perforation. With the advancement 
of medical management, the incidence of gastric perforation 
has decreased to <10% of peptic ulcer disease. It is most 
commonly seen in elderly patients who use NSAIDs and in 
patients who extensively consume alcohol.[13]
The effect of methamphetamine on gastric perforation is con-
troversial, and there are very few studies on this extremely 
rare condition.[1,5] Thirteen (44.8%) of 29 cases in our study 
were related to substance use. In addition, we subjectively 
state that our cases used the substance in higher doses than 
other societies. Pathophysiologically, the common point is 
ischemia. It has been suggested that the effects of metham-
phetamine on the gastric mucosa may induce focal ischemia 
and inhibit gastric motility.[1,14] Other associated pathophysi-
ological mechanisms may be increased air intake with in-
crease in intragastric and intra-abdominal pressure caused by 
inhalation of the substance, platelet aggregation and vascular 
thrombosis, vasoconstriction, and vasospasm.[1,15]
In our study, gastric perforation developed in one patient 
who was followed up with COVID-19 pneumonia, and clini-
cal mortality was observed due to post-operative pneumonia 
and lung failure. The occurrence of COVID-19 with gastro-
intestinal perforation is rarely reported. Hence far, only 16 
gastrointestinal perforations associated with COVID-19 have 
been reported in the literature.[16]
However, it has not been possible to clearly determine 
whether these events individually or collectively pre-dispose 
to peptic ulcer perforation. Despite our findings, and based 
on this study design, we cannot fully confirm that this is a 
causal factor. These conclusions were reached on the basis 
of history alone and excluding any other possible etiologies.
While peptic ulcer perforation occurred in the pre-pyloric 
region in 7 (53.8%) of those who used fire ice, 14 (87.5%) 
of those who did not use fire ice material were seen in the 
first section of the duodenum. A statistically significant cor -
relation was found between localization and the use of fire 
and ice (P<0.001). The effect size of this relationship was 
calculated as 0.734. Typically, peptic ulcers were usually ob-
served in the pre-pyloric region in those who used fire-ice 
substance, while they predominantly occurred in the first 
section of the duodenum in those who did not use this sub-
stance (Table 4).
When reviewing the existing literature, it is evident that pep-
tic ulcer perforation associated with methamphetamine use 
is concentrated in the post-pyloric region. [1] In this regard, 
our study differs from the findings in the literature. However, 
in a study of gastric perforation due to heroin-cocaine use, it 
was observed that perforation was intense in the pre-pyloric 
area.[12]
When we evaluated additional substance addictions, we found 
that some of the 13 patients had a history of using multiple 
substances but had only used “fire and ice” during this par -
ticular period due to its accessibility and affordability. Cases 
of perforation resulting from the use of additional substances 
were excluded from the study since we specifically focused 
on the effects of “fire and ice.”
In terms of the surgical procedures performed, it was observed 
that graham omentoplasty or primary repair+omentoplasty 
was generally employed. Roux-en-Y gastroenterostomy was 
only performed in the case with duodenal second section 
perforation in the first group, attributed to pyloric stenosis.
While intraoperative biopsies were taken in six of the cases in 
the first group, the pathology results indicated active inflamed 
fibrotic tissue. In contrast, intraoperative biopsies were not 
performed in any case in Group 2. However, it was noted that 
five of these cases (out of a total of 16 cases) attended their 
post-operative follow-up appointments for control endosco-
py. Interestingly, none of the patients in the first group sought 
control endoscopy (out of 13 cases). This may be attributed 
to the fact that these patients were generally experiencing 
depression, agitation, and maladaptive behaviors.
In complications, five wound infections were seen in the first 
group, while one wound infection was observed in the sec-
ond group. No statistically significant difference was found. It 
is known that smoking is one of the factors related to the pa-
tient in the development of wound infection.[17] It is thought 
that wound infection is more common in substance use with 
a similar pathophysiology.
In terms of mortality, no mortality was observed in Group 
A, and 2 patients (12.5%) (6.89% compared to the total case)

died in Group B. One of these patients died due to post-
operative respiratory problems after being operated under 
the diagnosis of COVID-19, and the other patient died due 
to first-admission sepsis and post-operative multiorgan failure 
syndrome. Statistically, there was no significant difference in 
morbidity and mortality in both groups.
The clinical presentation, radiological findings, length of hos-
pital stay, procedure, and drainage used were similar to those 
reported in the literature.
CONCLUSION
Long-term consumption of methamphetamine, known as fire 
and ice, is a significant risk factor for the development of 
ulcer and subsequent perforation, especially among young 
patients. It has been observed that this risk factor, which is 
currently considered rare, has been increasingly prevalent in a 
short period in our clinic.
According to unofficial data, it is estimated that six out of 
10 young people in our province can easily access and use 
this substance. The age of use has decreased to 10–11 years. 
We follow-up with surgical treatment in our clinic not only 
gastric perforation but also many patients who are injured by 
a sharp object, firearm, or beating due to substance abuse, by 
a relative living in the same house or by a stranger. The use 
of this substance, which is considered a major social threat, 
is becoming more and more widespread, and this study rep-
resents is only a small part of the iceberg reflected in the 
general surgery clinic of a hospital.

AMAÇ: Madde bağımlılığına bağlı perforasyonlar ile ilgili literatüre birçok çalışma yapılmış olup, inhaler metamfetaminle ilgili perforasyonlar hakkında 
sınırlı sayıda yayın mevcuttur. Son zamanlarda, kliniğimizde bu ilacın tüketiminde belirgin bir artışa sekonder olduğunu düşündüğümüz, özellikle 
perfore peptik ülseri olan hastaların sayısında artış olduğunu gördük. Bu çalışmanın temel amacı, “ateş&buz” olarak bilinen inhale metamfetamin 
kullanımının peptik perforasyonu ve komplikasyonları, özellikle perforasyon ile doğrudan ilişkili bir faktör olup olmadığını belirlemek ve ayrıca bu 
madde kullanımına bağlı peptik ülser perforasyonu olan hastaların demografik değişkenlerini literatür eşliğinde belirlemektir.
GEREÇ VE YÖNTEM: 2021 yılında kliniğimizde cerrahi tedavi uygulanan 29 mide perforasyonu hastalarının tıbbi kayıtları incelenerek retrospektif 
bir çalışma yapıldı. Veriler, SPSS.23 (IBM Inc., Chicago, IL, ABD) programına aktarılarak istatistiksel analizlerle değerlendirildi. Sürekli değişkenlerin 
normallik varsayımları Kolmogorov-Smirnov testi, varyans homojenlikleri ise Levene testi ile incelendi. İki düzeyli karşılaştırmalar, veriler normal 
dağılıyor ise T testi, verilerin normal dağılmadığı iki düzeyli karşılaştırmalar için Mann-Whitney U-testi kullanıldı. Kategorik değişkenler arasındaki 
ilişkiler ki-kare test analizi ile incelendi. Bütün analizlerde anlamlılık düzeyi olarak p<0.05 değeri kabul edildi.
BULGULAR: Yirmi dokuz hasta, metamfetamin kullananlar (n=13) ve kullanmayanlar (n=16) olmak üzere iki gruba ayrıldı. Metamfetamin kullanan 
grupta daha düşük olan yaşa göre istatistiksel olarak anlamlı bir fark vardı (31.69 - 48.8- p=0.025). Gruplar arasında PU öyküsü varlığı anlamlı 
derecede farklılık göstermekteydi (p=0.009). İlginç bir şekilde, madde bağımlarlında AST-ALT değerleri daha düşüktü (p=0.020). Ayrıca, gruplar 
arasında lokalizasyonda önemli farklılık mevcuttu (p<0.001). Cinsiyet, klinik durum, diğer laboratuvar değerleri, açısından iki grup arasında istatis-
tiksel olarak anlamlı fark yoktu. Madde kullanmayan grupta nadir olarak 1 hasta Kovid tedavisi altında iken mide perforasyonu ile ameliyata alındı.
SONUÇ: Ateş&buz olarak bilinen metamfetamin tüketimi, özellikle genç hastalarda ve bu narkotik maddenin uzun süreli tüketiminde ülser gelişimi 
ve ardından perforasyon olayı için önemli bir risk faktörüdür. Halihazırda nadir olarak kabul edilen bu risk faktörünün kliniğimizde az sürede oldukça 
fazla sayıda görüldüğü tespit edilmiştir. Resmi olmayan verilere göre, ilimizde her 10 gençten 6’sının bu maddeye kolayca ulaşabildiği ve kullandığı tah-
min edilmektedir. Kullanım yaşı 10-11 yaşına kadar düşmüştür. Sadece mide perforasyonu olarak değil, madde kullanımına bağlı, aynı evde yaşayan 
yakını veya bir yabancı tarafından kesici delici alet, ateşli silah veya darp ile yaralanan birçok hastayı da kliniğimizde cerrahi tedavi ile takip etmekteyiz. 
Toplumsal büyük bir tehdit olarak kabul edilen bu maddenin kullanımı gittikçe yaygınlaşmakta, bu çalışma ise sadece bir hastanenin genel cerrahi 
kliniğine yansıyan buzdağının görünen kısmının oldukça küçük bir parçasıdır.
