Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is a highly useful synthetic polyester plastic that
is widely used in daily life. However, the increase in postconsumer PET as plastic
waste that is recalcitrant to biodegradation in landﬁlls and the natural environment
has raised worldwide concern. Currently, traditional PET recycling processes with
thermomechanical or chemical methods also result in the deterioration of the
mechanical properties of PET. Therefore, it is urgent to develop more efﬁcient and
green strategies to address this problem. Recently, a novel mesophilic PET-
degrading enzyme ( IsPETase) from Ideonella sakaiensis was found to
streamline PET biodegradation at 30
°C, albeit with a lower PET-degrading
activity than chitinase or chitinase-like PET-degrading enzymes. Consequently,
the molecular engineering of more efﬁcient PETases is still required for further
industrial applications. This review details current knowledge on IsPETase,
MHETase, and IsPETase-like hydrolases, including the structures, ligand ‒
protein interactions, and rational protein engineering for improved PET-
degrading performance. In particular, applications of the engineered catalysts
are highlighted, including metabolic engineering of the cell factories, enzyme
immobilization or cell surface display. The information is expected to provide
novel insights for the biodegradation of complex polymers.

1 Introduction
Plastics are highly useful synthetic materials and nearly omnipresent in our daily life,
which have also revolutionized modern life in various sectors, such as clothing, automotive,
medical, and electronic industries. Among them, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is the
most widely used synthetic polyester plastic, especially in the packaging industry. However,
with the increasing consumption, a remarkable part of plastics is accumulated in landﬁlls and
the natural environment as plastic waste (García-Martínez and Collar, 2023; Kwon, 2023).
Only 9% of all plastics ever produced were estimated to be recycled and 12% were incinerated
(Tiso et al., 2021). Caused by the strong physical durability and chemical stability, PET is
usually recalcitrant to biodegradation. As a result, the white crisis has raised a globally
burgeoning concern (Sohn et al., 2020).
To deal with the increasingly serious problem of plastic waste, on the one hand
researchers have been searching for alternatives to petroleum-derived plastics to replace

the conventional plastics. Bioplastics ( Venâncio, Lopes, and
Oliveira, 2022 ; Jayakumar et al., 2023 ), as the novel
biodegradable materials made of renewable sources (e.g., plants)
or biological material (e.g., starch), have drawn great attentions
globally. They are usually renewable, biodegradable, compostable,
and environment friendly, such as polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs)
(Khatami et al., 2021), Mater-bi
®(Magni et al., 2020). Deﬁnition of
bioplastic is not consensual, however based on the sources,
bioplastics could be classi ﬁed into: the bio-based and
biodegradable polymers; the bio-based but bio-nondegradable,
and the biodegradable polymers synthesized chemically ( Arif
et al., 2023). Though (compostable) bioplastics still represent less
than 0.5% of global plastics production (Bioplastics, 2023), the
global demand for the bioplastics is growing rapidly. Even so,
there are still many challenges to deal with associated with the
bioplastics (Dolci, Rigamonti, and Grosso, 2023). Firstly, efﬁcient
degradation of bioplastics usually combined with the traditional
plastic are often time-consuming, laborious, and costly. In addition,
limited and slow degradability of different bioplastics would be
caused by different biological processes such as the aerobic or
anaerobic conditions and thermophilic or mesophilic treatment.
The main purpose of this review is to provide an overview for
efﬁcient management of petroleum-based plastics waste (especially
PET material) catalysed by the PETase especially theIsPETase or the
mutants. Therefore, details on the bioplastics were not discussed,
which could be found in other excellent studies (Ali et al., 2022;
Ghasemlou et al., 2022; Jayakumar et al., 2023; Park et al., 2023;
Pascoe Ortiz, 2023; Rajeshkumar et al., 2023).
On the other hand, recently the concept of circular carbon
economy based on biotechnological plastic recycling has become a
thriving research area in recent years (Ru, Huo, and Yang, 2020; Ellis
et al., 2021a; Kakadellis and Rosetto, 2021; Simon et al., 2021). In
addition to the traditional mechanical recycling and chemical
recycling ( Mederake, 2022 ), biocatalytic depolymerization
catalyzed by PET-degrading enzymes (e.g., PETase) has emerged
as a promising and sustainable alternative for PET upcycling and
enable circularity (Magalhães, Cunha, and Sousa, 2021; Cao et al.,
2022; Lai et al., 2022; Ambrose-Dempster et al., 2023). A variety of
naturally occurring plastic degrading enzymes have been discovered
and characterized from microbial sources (Kawai, 2021; Erickson
et al., 2022; Khairul Anuar et al., 2022; Wei et al., 2022; Zhu, Wang,
and Wei, 2022). These PET-hydrolysing enzymes breaking the PET
polymer into diverse water-soluble products, such as terephthalic
acid (TPA), ethylene glycol (EG), and (mono-(2-hydroxyehyl)
terephthalic acid (MHET). Generally, PET-degrading enzymes
can be classi ﬁed into thermophilic enzymes and mesophilic
enzymes according to the optimal reaction temperature. In 2005,
a hydrolase was identiﬁed that could hydrolyse two kinds of PET
ﬁlms at 55
°C and is believed to be theﬁrst reported PET-degrading
enzyme (RJ et al., 2005).
To date, around 89 different enzymes (PAZy database (Buchholz
et al., 2022), https://pazy.eu/doku.php) with PET-degrading ability
have been discovered and characterized (Magalhães, Cunha, and
Sousa, 2021), and most of them can be classiﬁed in the subfamily of
carboxylic ester hydrolases ( Table 1 , EC 3.1.1.x), such as
carboxylesterase (EC 3.1.1.1) (von Haugwitz et al., 2022), lipases
(Moyses et al., 2021 ), cutinases (EC 3.1.1.74) ( Wei and
Zimmermann, 2017), and arylesterase (EC 3.1.1.2) (Austin et al.,
2018). Great progress has been made involving cutinases or
cutinase-like PET-degrading enzymes (Sulaiman et al., 2012; Xue
et al., 2021; Brandenberg, Schubert, and Kruglyak, 2022; Jia et al.,
2022; Lu et al., 2022), and there are several excellent reviews of
cutinases relevant to PET hydrolysis (Zumstein et al., 2017; Tamoor
et al., 2021; Urbanek, Kosiorowska, and Mirończuk, 2021; Kumar
et al., 2022).
In 2016, two novel enzymes [ISF6_4831 ( IsPETase) and
ISF6_0224 ( IsMHETase)] were identi ﬁed and determined to
be capable of hydrolysing lo w-crystallinity (1.9%) PET ﬁlm
from Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6 at 30 °C( Yoshida et al.,
2016 ). IsPETase shows great potential for industrially
relevant PET degradation because of its relatively high
degradation activities and low catalytic temperatures ( Maity
et al., 2021 ). The increasing numbers of known IsPETase
variants ( Table 2), such as DuraPETase (Y. Cui, Chen, et al.,
2021b ), Fast-PETase (Lu et al., 2022) and TS-PETase (Zhong-
Johnson, Voigt, and Sinskey, 2021), have further increased their
application potential. In particular, the engineered
thermostable PETase mutant (HotPETase) shows more
efﬁcient cry-PET hydrolysing activity at 40
°Ct h a nL C CICCG
at 65 °C( Bell, Smithson, and Kilbride, 2022 ). All these
advantages highlight the promise of enzymatic industrial
PET depolymerization with mini mal additional pretreatment.
This review presents a brief overview of the recent advances in
IsPETase, IsMHETase and special cutinases with PET-degrading
activities, including their structures, catalytic mechanisms, and
applications. In particular, rational protein engineering based on
macromolecular structures is highlighted. Finally, further
perspectives on the industrial applications of enzyme-catalysed
PET degradation are discussed.
2 Promising mesophilic enzymes for
PET degradation
2.1 PET hydrolase fromIdeonella sakaiensis
2.1.1 IsPETase
In 2016, a PET-degrading bacterium,Ideonella sakaiensis 201-
F6, was identiﬁed and found to grow on low-crystallinity (1.9%) PET
ﬁlm at 30°C, degrading the PETﬁlm almost completely after 6 weeks
(Yoshida et al., 2016). To more PET-degrading enzymes (ISF6_
4831 and ISF6_0224) fromI. sakaiensis201-F6 were determined to
be capable of degrading PET into MHET (ISF6_4831, also named
IsPETase) and MHET into TPA (ISF6_0224, also named
MHETase). In addition,IsPETase is currently known as the most
efﬁcient PET-degrading cutinase operating at room temperature
(Kan et al., 2021), although it also suffers from the common problem
of low thermostability at the glass transition temperature (T
g)o f
PET. Crystal structures ofIsPETase have been reported to illustrate
the structure-activity relationship, catalytic mechanism, and rational
site-directed mutagenesis.
Based on the structures (Figure 1A)( Han et al., 2017; Joo et al.,
2018), IsPETase belongs to the α/β hydrolase superfamily with
highly conserved structures, including the central twistedβ-sheet
(α3) formed by 9 mixedβ-strands and surrounded by 7α-helices
and the Gly-X-Ser-X-Gly motif. Ser160, Asp206 and His237 form

the catalytic triad, and two disulﬁde bonds (C203-C239 and C237-
C289) were also identiﬁed. Site-directed mutation analysis showed
that DS1, W156, S185 and Y58 might play critical roles in PET
degradation ( Han et al., 2017 ). Moreover, the residues
W156 adjacent to the active site displayed variable
conformations, including the “A”, “B” and “C” conformers,
which are important for substrate binding and product release.
Interestingly, the enzyme-substrate interactions of IsPETase are
highly identical to those of ICCG, and the most notable variation
is that the aromatic moiety of two bound ligands deviated by
~30
°(Zeng et al., 2022).
The substrate binding site (HEMT) is located in a shallow cleft
surrounded by the hydrophobic residues A131, H208, W156, I179,
W130, Y58, and M132 on the protein surface (Figure 1B). It was also
revealed that IsPETase exhibits a more open active-site cleft than
homologous cutinases (Austin et al., 2018). In addition, theﬂexible
β1-β2 connecting loop far from the active site was suggested to be
responsible for the increased stability and activity of IsPETase, and
the β7-α5 connecting loop might be associated with substrate
binding (da Costa et al., 2021).
Based on special features and phylogenic analysis,IsPETase-like
(PL) enzymes and canonical cutinases are divided into type I
enzymes, type IIa enzymes, and type IIb enzymes ( Joo et al.,
2018). Type I enzymes lack the extensiveβ8-α6 loop and have an
extra disulﬁde bond that is not conserved in the other homologous
enzymes. Type IIa and IIb enzymes are characterized by different
putative secondary substrate-binding subsites: Ser/Thr is conserved
in type IIb enzymes and Phe/Tyr is conserved in IIa enzymes.
Further study showed thatIsPETase was also capable of efﬁciently
degrading p-hexanoate (p-NH) esters (k
cat = 1,345.46 s−1,K m =
0.0528 mM, and kcat/Km = 25,487). Structure analysis showed that
the crystal structure ofIsPETase is quite similar to that of cut190,
particularly in the similar fold of the Ca2+-binding sites (Figures 2A,
C–E). Although the promotion effects of Ca2+ and + were revealed in
this study, to date, no crystal structure has displayed the binding of
Ca2+ to IsPETase. IsPETase displayed the highest enzymatic activity at
35°C; however, at 55°C, it showed almost no enzymatic activity (C. Liu
et al., 2019 ). To improve the thermostability of IsPETase,
immobilization by ammonium sulfate precipitation and
glutaraldehyde cross-linking was performed: consequently, the
optimal reaction temperature was increased from 35
°Ct o4 5°C,
and the enzyme retained ~60% of the maximum activity at 65°C.
Given that hydrophobic and steric effects might be associated with the
different substrate speciﬁcities, critical residues around the catalytic
centre were engineered for altered substrate speciﬁcity. The results
showed that the mutations S93M, W159F, and IN241F could all
change the substrate speciﬁcity of wild IsPETase with improved
enzymatic activities for 1-naphthyl acetate. In particular, the
W159F mutant displayed the highest catalytic activity for 1-
naphthyl acetate, which might be caused by the mutated Phe
contributing to the entrance of the bulky substrate naphthyl to the
catalytic cleft, alleviating the steric effect (Figure 2B).
2.1.2 Promising mutants ofIsPETase
2.1.2.1 IsPETaseS121D/D186H
To date, great efforts have been made to improve the
thermostability and PET-degrading activity of IsPETase. Stefan
Brott et al. applied random mutagenesis with error-prone PCR
for the screening of potential mutants with enhanced
performance ( Brott et al., 2022 ). The obtained mutant
IsPETaseTM
K95N/F201I showed a 5.0°C higher Tm value than the
wild type but also had slightly lower activity on PET. Recently, a
web-based mutation design tool (Premuse,http://www.elabcaas.cn/
pird/premuse.html) was developed to predict preferred mutations
(Meng et al., 2021). As a semirational design strategy based on
natural sequence evolution, the main feature of Premuse was the

pairwise alignment process and the calculated position-speci ﬁc
amino acid probabilities (PSAPs). The former was used to
process alignment, avoiding the calculations necessary for
multiple sequence alignment, and the latter was used to
quantitatively select the preferred mutations. The results showed
that the best mutant, W159H/F229Y, was identiﬁed from only ten
variants, and the Tm, kcat/km and half-life were increased by 10.4
°C,
2-fold and 3-fold compared with those of wildIsPETase. The mean
decomposition rate reached 23.4 mg PET/h/mg enzyme for the PET
bottle after 3 days. This study is important for the rational design of
promising PET-degrading catalysts; however, no crystal structures
have been published highlighting the detailed contributions caused
by site-directed mutations.
As shown by the crystal structures ofIsPETase (Son et al., 2019),
the centralβ sheet is interrupted by the Pro181 residue located in the
abnormal conformation of the β6 strand (Figure 3A), which is
believed to play an important role in the thermal stability.
Therefore, the P181A mutant was constructed to recover the
continuity of the centralβ sheet. In addition, the B factors show
that the β6-β7 connecting loop (Asp186-Phe191) located at the
protein surface is one of the most ﬂexible regions in IsPETase
without any interactions with neighbouring regions. This was
considered to be another important factor in ﬂuencing its
thermostability. The mutant S121D/D186H was generated to
increase the thermostability of theβ6-β7 connecting loop by the
formation of an additional H-bond. The results showed that the T
m
values of IsPETaseP181A and IsPETaseS121D/D186H were 49.25°C and
54.85°C, respectively, reﬂecting increases of approximately 0.5°C and
6°C. The decreased catalytic activity of the P181A, P181G, and
P181S mutations indicates that P181 might play an essential role in
thermostability and PET degradation ability. This hypothesis must
be further tested. However, theIsPETase
S121D/D186H mutant displayed
increased thermostability and PET-degrading activity
simultaneously, and at 40 °C, the PET-degrading activity of
IsPETaseS121D/D186H was increased by 6.0-fold after 72 h of
incubation.
2.1.2.2 ThermoPETase
Based on previous ﬁndings (Joo et al., 2018), the synergistic
effect of the R280A mutation was integrated intoIsPETaseS121D/D186H

and IsPETaseS121E/D186H, further improving the Tm values by ~7.6°C
and 8.81°C, respectively, compared with that of IsPETaseWT.
Moreover, the PET-degrading activity of IsPETaseS121E/D186H/R280A
was further increased by 13.9-fold compared to that of wild-type
IsPETase after 72 h of incubation at 40°C. Structural analysis of
IsPETaseS121E/D186H/R280A (ThermoPETase, Figure 3) showed that the
R280A and D186H mutations contribute to the formation of 1 and
2 additional H-bonds with the free water molecule, respectively, and
the S121E mutation helps form 2 additional intramolecular H-bonds
and 2 extramolecular H-bonds with free water molecules. Although
the catalytic performance of IsPETase
S121E/D186H/R280A was
signiﬁcantly improved, including the thermostability and PET-
degrading activity, the detailed mechanisms were not clearly
elucidated. In this study, the improvements were mainly caused
by the increased thermostability and durability.
2.1.2.3 IsPETase
S121E/D186H/N246D/S242T
In a subsequent study, a structural bioinformatics-based strategy
was used for the rational design ofIsPETase (Son et al., 2020). The
study mainly focused on the engineering of the substrate binding
site, and based on multiple structure alignment, 27 residues
constituting the substrate binding site of IsPETase were
identiﬁed. In addition, 9 residues were further selected for site-
directed mutagenesis, and the resulting mutantsIsPETase
S242T and
IsPETaseN246D displayed signi ﬁcantly increased activities. After
incubation at 37 °C for 72 h, the catalytic activities of
IsPETaseS242T and IsPETaseN246D were increased by 1.5- and 2.4-
fold, respectively, compared with those of wild-type IsPETase.
However, when the N246D mutation was added to
IsPETase
S121E/D186H/R280A, the results showed that the obtained
IsPETaseS121E/D186H/N246D/R280A displayed signi ﬁcantly decreased
activity and thermostability. Additionally, from the crystal
structures ( Figure 3D ), salt bridges between D246 and
Arg280 and the additional formed H-bonds were identi ﬁed,
which might be factors in the increased catalytic performance.
This indicates that the N246D mutation might be more
important for enzyme activity. Based on these ﬁndings, the
S242T mutation was integrated intoIsPETase
S121E/D186H/N246D; the
results showed that the Tm value was increased by 1°C, and the PET-
degrading activity was increased by 58- and 1.5-fold compared with
that of wild-typeIsPETase and theIsPETaseS121E/D186H/R280A mutant
at 37°C.
2.1.2.4 DuraPETase
In a recent study, a computational strategy, greedy accumulated
strategy for protein engineering (GRAPE), was developed to

Liu et al. 10.3389/fbioe.2023.1263996
improve the robustness ofIsPETase (Y. Cui, Chen, et al., 2021b). The
GRAPE strategy included three main steps: 1) The generation of
stabilizing mutations with multiple algorithms (e.g., ABACUS,
FoldX, Consensus analysis) led to the identi ﬁcation of
253 unique predicted mutations. 2) The characterization of
beneﬁcial mutations based on biophysical pitfalls led to a
sublibrary of 85 candidates. Among them, 21-well-expressed
mutants were determined to show increased stability. Based on
the K-means algorithm, these 21 identi ﬁed hits were further
clustered into three groups for the subsequent accumulation
process. 3) Accumulation of the mutations in each cluster
according to the greedy algorithm based on the stability-
mediated physical features led to a total of 65 combined variants,
among which IsPETase-M10 (named DuraPETase, S214H-I168R-
W159H-S188Q-R280A-A180I-G165A-Q119Y-L117F-T140D)
from the third cluster was identiﬁed as the most thermostable
variant, displaying dramatically increased thermostability. The T
m
value of DuraPETase was increased to 77°C, which was enhanced by
~3 1°C compared with wildIsPETase.
When applied for the digestion of semicrystalline PET ﬁlm
(30%) after 10 days at 37°C, the released soluble products reached up
to 3.1 mM, and the conversion was determined to be ~15 ± 1%,

Liu et al. 10.3389/fbioe.2023.1263996
which was ~300-fold higher than that released by IsPETase.
Compared with LCC, TfH, Tfcut2, Cut190, and Cut190Q138A/D250C-
E296C/Q123H/N202H, the catalytic performance of DuraPETase against
the same PETﬁlm was increased by 1.7-, 13-, 55-, 10-, and 8-fold
after 3 days of incubation at 37°C. Importantly, at 37°C, complete
degradation of nanoplastics (⌀ =5 0–100 nm) was catalysed by
IsPETase and DuraPETase within 1 h. Structure analysis and
molecular simulation showed that the mutations introduced new
electrostatic interactions (I168R, shown as orange linesFigure 4C),
improved hydrophobic packing [L117F, Q119Y, A180I, S214H, and
R280A, shown as pink lines ( Figures 4C, E ), reduced the
conformational entropy (G165A, Figure 15D), and led to the
formation of additional H-bonds (shown as green lines).
In particular, the W159H mutation located near the catalytic
triad probably reconstructed the binding site of DuraPETase (shown
in grey surface,Figure 4B), which is also true for the functions of the
L117F and Q119Y mutations viaπ-π interactions with Tyr87. S214H
was concluded to be capable of preventing the wobbling of
Trp185 by an offset parallel π-π stacking interaction. Mutations
S214H, Trp185, Tyr87, L117F, and Q119Yﬁnely regulate the active-
site cleft suitable for PET binding, which was named the“aromatic
tunnel” ﬂanker. Tyr87, Q119Y, and Trp185 could enhance PET
binding through π-π interactions with the aromatic motif. The
incorporation of these mutations might contribute to the
increased catalytic performance, which further illustrates the
improved ability to lower the likelihood of combining mutations
with adverse effects and a lack of target protein structures in enzyme
engineering.
2.1.2.5 DuraPETase
N233C/S282C/H214S/S245R
Based on DuraPETase, another mutant named DuraPETase-4
M (DuraPETaseN233C/S282C/H214S/S245R) was designed to increase the
overall rigidity (N233C/S282C), regulate the ﬂexibility of the
W185 region (H214S), and optimize the protein surface
FIGURE 6

electrostatic charge (S245R) (Y. Liu, Liu, et al., 2022a). It should be
noted that the H214S substitution led to decreased stability at 60°C,
and the degradation performance against the amorphous PET
powder was signiﬁcantly improved. This also reﬂects the activity-
stability trade-offs. When maintained at 60°C for 96 h, DuraPETase-
4Me fﬁciently hydrolysed the PETﬁlm (crystallinity 10.2%) with a
degradation percentage of 69.8%, which is a 5.4-fold improvement
over DuraPETase.
Similarly, an electrostatic interaction-based method was
developed for the rational design of IsPETase and investigating
the roles of electrostatic interactions in thermostability (Yin et al.,
2022). Residues S92 (on theα3 helix), I139 (on theα4 helix) and
D157 (on the loop connectingβ6 andβ7) on the protein surface were
rationally selected and mutated to the positively charged residues.
The I139R mutation led to the highest increase inΔT
m of 8.71°C
(Tm = 56.37°C), the R251A mutation caused a Tm value increase of
4.68°C( Tm = 52.34°C), and the S92R/D157E mutation resulted in an
increase of 2.18°C( Tm = 51.48°C). Introduction of the R251A
mutation into the above obtained mutants further improved their
T
m values, which were 53.08°C( ΔTm = 5.42°C) and 54.80°C( ΔTm =
7.14°C) for theIsPETaseS92K/R251A variant andIsPETaseS92R/D157E/R251A,
respectively. With improved thermostability, IsPETaseI139R also
displayed a 3.6-fold improvement in degradation activity.
Interestingly, using the MHET substrate at 30°C, the kcat of the
IsPETaseS92K/D157E/R251A variant was shown to be increased by 1.74-
fold. In particular, the IsPETaseS92K/D157E/R251A variant could fully
degrade PET into TPA alone without MHET, which might be caused
by a narrower substrate binding cleft. Thus, only the smaller, EG
moiety was capable of entering the active site for further hydrolysis.
This is an unusual and importantﬁnding, especially for promoting
the PET circular economy in the future.
2.1.2.6 FAST-PETase (PETase
S121E/D186H/R224Q/N233K/R280A)
In a similar study, rational protein engineering based on a
structure-based machine learning algorithm was applied for the
design of robust and efﬁcient PET hydrolase (Lu et al., 2022).
MutCompute (https://mutcompute.com), a web-based tool based
on deep learning-guided predictions for protein mutagenesis, was
used for the discovery of thermostable mutants (Figure 5). From all
29 possible combinations with the four obtained mutations (S121E,
T140D, R224Q and N233K) across the three promising PETase

Liu et al. 10.3389/fbioe.2023.1263996
scaffolds (IsPETase, ThermoPETase and DuraPETase), 23 mutants
displayed increased Tm compared with their respective scaffolds. In
particular, FAST-PETase (PETase
S121E/D186H/R224Q/N233K/R280A) showed
a 38-fold increase in PET hydrolytic activity at 50°C compared with
that of ThermoPETase, with 33.8 mM PET monomers released after
96 h. Even compared with LCC and LCC
ICCM, FAST-PETase also
demonstrated better performance at mild temperatures and
moderate pH conditions. In particular, at 50 °C, FAST-PETase
displayed the highest overall depolymerization rate of the highly
crystalline substrates compared with the thermophilic enzymes
(LCC and ICCM), IsPETase and ThermoPETase and
DuraPETase. Moreover, FAST-PETase is capable of
depolymerizing the pretreated ﬁlms (~2% crystallinity) by quick
temperature quenching, releasing 32.8 mM PET monomers at 50
°C
after 24 h. It could even degrade highly crystalline (23.6%)ﬁlms by
releasing 23.8 mM PET monomers.
Structure analysis ( Figure 6 ) revealed several additional
intramolecular salt bridges (shown in the orange line formed
between the K233 mutation and E204), Figure 6B), hydrogen
bonds (Figure 6B–D, shown in green lines) and hydrophobic
interactions (shown in pink lines formed between the
H186 mutation, P120 and F191, Figure 6C). Importantly, the
portability and effectiveness of these machine learning-based
predictions were further validated by the introduction of the
corresponding N233K mutation to LCC, ICCM and Cut190. The
results showed that theΔT
m values of LCCD238K and Cut190D250K

were increased by 7°C, although the ΔTm of ICCMC238K/C283S was
decreased by 3.7°C on amorphous gf-PET.
Raghav Shroff et al. developed a structure-based deep learning
model, a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), which could be
trained to deduce amino acid-structure relationships by connecting
amino acids with the local chemical microenvironments (Shroff
et al., 2020). This would be helpful for the discovery of novel gain-of-
function mutations that might be missed by energetics-based
strategies. It empirically identiﬁes native residues discordant with
their structural and chemical expectations or the local environment
as ideal targets for rational protein engineering. The results indicate
that this strategy performs better in combination with the widely
used protein design tools based on energetics simulations and
generates potential gain-of-function mutants with high-frequency
and state-of-the-art accuracy. Ultimately, the obtained mutants with
improved function in vivo were determined to be increased by
approximately 6- and 30-fold across three diverse proteins.
2.1.2.7 HotPETase
Robust PETases satisfying the demands of industrial processes
are key to realizing industrial plastic biodegradation. To further
improve the thermostability of IsPETase, an automated, high-
throughput directed evolution protocol was reported for the
screening and identi ﬁcation of promising PET-degrading
biocatalysts (Bell, Smithson, and Kilbride, 2022 ). The reaction
temperature and the extended reaction time were used for
selection pressure. After six rounds of evolution, the most
thermostable IsPETase variant, HotPETase
(IsPETase
S121E/D186H/R280A/P181V/S207R/S214Y/Q119K/S213E/N233C/S282C/R90T/Q182M/
N212K/R224L/S58A/S61V/K95N/M154G/N241C/K252M/T270Q, Figure 7 , PDB ID:
7QVH), was identi ﬁed. It contains 21 amino acid mutations
compared to the wild IsPETase, and the Tm (82.5°C) was
increased by 25.7°C compared with the starting IsPETaseTS.A t
65°C, after 1 h, each mole of HotPETase releases more monomers
than LCCICCG does, revealing its superior catalytic performance. In
particular, under the optimal conditions, 0.5μM HotPETase could
degrade cryPET (0.4% crystallinity, 4 g/L), releasing 6.07 mM soluble
monomer within 5 h at 60°C with a degree of depolymerization of
31%. This is the most promising IsPETase mutant for PET
biodegradation.
Crystal structure analysis showed that the P181V mutation
created an additional hydrogen bond, altered surface charge
distributions, especially in the substrate binding cleft, and
substantially decreased ﬂexibility around the regions formed by
the residues from Ala183 to Asn190 and Cys203 to Leu216. The
mentioned mutations would further improve the packing of the
central β-sheet region; moreover, the well-deﬁned conformation of
Trp185 was shown to be unnecessary for ef ﬁcient PET
deconstruction. This ﬁnding illustrates the obscure functions of
P181 (Son et al., 2019).
2.1.2.8 GrAnc8
In a recent study ( Joho et al., 2023 ), ancestral protein
reconstruction (ASR) was used to understand the evolutionary
history of IsPETase from ancient serine hydrolases. First, the
phylogenetic trees and ancestral sequences were reconstructed
with the ASR1 dataset (82 sequences, constructed by GRASP)
and ASR2 data (147 sequences, constructed by CodeML). Then,
the Rosetta-based algorithm protein repair one-stop shop (PROSS)
was used for the identiﬁcation of evolutionarily conserved mutations
responsible for stability and catalytic activity. This resulted in a
library of 15 PETase mutants containing 9 to>50 mutations, among
which 5 mutants (GrAnc9, GrAnc8, CoAnc3, PROSS4, PROSS5)
exhibited signiﬁcantly increased thermostability with T
m values
approximately 20°C higher than that of the wildIsPETaes.
In particular, the mutant GrAnc8 was determined to be the best
performing ancestor in terms of stability and activity. Through
structure analysis, signi ﬁcant variation in surface-exposed
residues was identi ﬁed, especially those lining the substrate
binding site. It was believed that the more cationic trend might
cause the improved stability; however, this (the altered surface
charge) was determined to be unrelated to any functional

adaptation of IsPETase. In addition, the deletion of a surface-
exposed loop (ADLK) between S278 and T279 was expected to
result in a clear increase in thermostability. Moreover, it was shown
that a segment around the active site (R171A, N186D, F218I, S214H,
D186S) played critical roles in regulating the degradation activity
and thermostability by accommodating the conformations of W185.
The structural basis for the evolution of the improved activity
revealed that it is mainly caused by remote mutations through
the increased level of sampling of catalytically productive
conformations of the existing functional residues. In this study,
the activity-stability trade-offs were also conﬁrmed, as in the case of
S214H, D186S and D186N, which increased stability but decreased
activity.
2.1.3 MHETase
Attention has been attracted again by the MHETase for PET
degradation, accompanied by the rapid development ofIsPETase for
the efﬁcient conversion of mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate
(MHET) to terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG)
with kcat = 31 ± 0.8 s−1 and Km = 7.3 ± 0.6 mM. Compared with
IsPETase, there are far fewer reported studies on the structures,
functions and engineering of the MHETase enzyme.
In the hostI. sakaiensis201-F6, the MHETase gene (ISF6_0224)
is located adjacent to the TPA-degrading gene cluster (Yoshida et al.,
2016), and the protein sequence shows sequence similarity to those
of the tannase family with highly conserved catalytic triad residues.
However, MHETase is determined to be nonhomologous to the
6 determined MHET-hydrolytic enzymes (TfH, FsC, Thc_Cut1,
Thc_Cut2, Thf42_Cut1, BsEstB), which was also con ﬁrmed by
the fact that MHETase was unable to degrade PET, BHET or
pNP aliphatic esters catalysed by the tannase.
Weber et al. reported the crystal structure of the active ligand-
free MHETase from I. sakaiensis bound to a nonhydrolyzable
MHET analogue (Palm et al., 2019). The overall architecture of
MHETase is more similar to that of feruloyl esterases (Figure 8B),
and it possesses the classic α/β-hydrolase domain, the highly

modes (D). (The light blue and white surface indicates the substrate-binding site; the free red residues indicate the water molecules; and the green

Liu et al. 10.3389/fbioe.2023.1263996
conserved catalytic triad S225-H528-D492, one highly conserved
disulﬁde bond (C224-C529) among ﬁve internal disulﬁde bonds
(C51-C92, C224-C529, C303-C320, C340-C348, C577-C599), and
the presence of a Ca
2+-binding site with the critical residue G132 in
the oxyanion hole and the lid domain. The disulﬁde bond can
stabilize the catalytic residues Ser and His, and the lid domain
associated with substrate speciﬁcity might be further maintained by
the bound Ca
2+ (Suzuki et al. 2014).
The binding mode of the MHETase-MHETA complex (Figures
9A, C) revealed that the substrate speciﬁcity is almost entirely
conferred by the lid domain. In the substrate binding site, the
substrate MHETA is stabilized by the hydrophobic interaction
between the phenyl ring of MHETA and the residues F495,
G132 and A494 (Figure 9B). Furthermore, the free carboxylate is
tightly bound by the lid domain residues R411 and S416 and two
water molecules through H-bond interactions. In addition, the
peptide bond maintains a hydrogen bond network with H528,
G132 and E226. In particular, F415 functions as a“gatekeeper”
that is positioned away from the active site when the enzyme is ready
for substrate binding; once the substrate is bound, the side chain of
F415 is triggered to rotate by nearly 180
°, closing the gate. This
probably leads to much tighter interactions between MHETase and
the substrate with a K
m of 7.3 μM. The functions of R411 were
further investigated by site-directed mutagenesis, and the results
showed that R411A and R411Q almost completely lost their MHET
hydrolysing activity. This is also true of S416 or S419 for regulating
substrate binding. Moreover, R411A, R411Q and F424N, with
altered positive charges, displayed signiﬁcantly higher hydrolysing
activity against BHET, indicating altered substrate speciﬁcity.
Recently, a 1.6 Å resolution MHETase structure was reported
(Figure 16) (Knott et al., 2020), which also highlights the MHETase
core domain, the lid domain and a Ca
2+ binding site, similar to the
overall structure in Figure 10A . As discussed above, distinct
structural conservation is also revealed between the MHET-
hydrolysing domain of MHETase and IsPETase. Except for the
observed F415 adopting a“closed” orientation on substrate binding,
the side chain of G410 would also trigger the active site with ligand
binding (Figure 10B).
In addition, molecular simulation indicated that the lid could be
further stabilized upon Ca
2+ binding, and the two-step reaction
(acylation and deacylation) mechanism was also investigated. First,
catalytic S225 is activated and deprotonated by H528, making it
ready for nucleophilic attack upon the carbonyl C of MHET, which
will lead to the formation of released, EG and the acyl-enzyme
intermediate. It is worth noting that the deacylation reaction
proceeds without, EG in the active site, and the nucleophilic
attack on the AEI by a water molecule liberates TPA. This
process was also assisted by H528, which could deprotonate the
FIGURE 12

catalytic water and transfer the proton to the catalytic S225 for
another catalytic cycle. Biochemical studies showed that MHETase
also displayed concentration-dependent substrate inhibition with a
K
m value of 23.17 ± 1.65μM and aKk value of 307.30 ± 20.65μM.
Although MHETaseS131G showed little concentration-dependent
substrate inhibition, it displayed an 8-fold higherKm value and
an ~3% reduction in catalytic activity, indicating a poor afﬁnity
for MHET.
The catalytic performance of the lidless MHETase was also
explored, which led to a signi ﬁcantly decreased catalytic rate
(~1,000-fold lower, kcat = 0.05 ± 0.03 s−1). This demonstrates the
important role of the lid domain in MHET-hydrolysing activity. The
inability of MHETase to act on MHE-isophthalate (MHEI) and
MHE-furanoate (MHEF) was also detected. Considering the
synergistic effect on PET depolymerization, chimeric enzymes
were constructed withﬂexible glycine-serine linkers (8–20 glycine
and serine residues) connecting the C-terminus of MHETase to the
N-terminus of PETase. The results showed that the chimeric
proteins all exhibit markedly improved PET and MHET turnover
compared with the single free enzyme or the mixed two free
enzymes. In my opinion, this ﬁnding is quite important for the
design of promising and effective multienzyme systems for the
efﬁcient degradation of PET waste.
The secretory expression of MHETase in an active form with
proper folding was achieved by Kim et al. inEscherichia coli with
the SP
LamB system (Hye Young Sagong et al., 2020). It was found
that MHETase might exist as a monomer, in contrast to the
structural homology of the dimer feruloyl esterase from
Aspergillus oryzae . This was believed to be caused by the
different conformation of its lid domain, which could inhibit
subsequent dimerization. The overall structure of the secreted
MHETase is almost identical to the released structure and
functions in an enzyme concentration-dependent manner.
Crystal structure analysis showed that the binding modes of
MHET and BHET in the active site of MHETase are quite
similar to each other ( Figures 11A, B ); in addition, the TPA
moiety was found to form an es ter bond with the catalytic
S225 residue. This indicates that BHET could also be
hydrolysed by MHETase, which was further con ﬁrmed to
function in a concentration-dependent manner although with
as i g n iﬁcantly lower hydrolysing activity. The BHET was bound
to the active site lined by R411, S416, G258, W420, A494, L254,
D492, H528, and S225. The, EG moiety was further stabilized by
R411, S416, G258 and L254 through H-bonds, and the TPA
moiety was also regulated by hydrophobic interactions with
A294 and L254. The special conformation of the, EG moiety
indicates that MHETase might also display exo-PETase activity
capable of hydrolysing the terminus of PET, which was conﬁrmed
by the successful hydrolysis of PET
5 to TPA.
Given these, rational engineering of the MHETase for improved
BHET-hydrolysing activity was achieved. First, MHETaseR411K was
designed to add a salt bridge with the carboxyl group of MHET to
stabilize the ester bond. The protein was obtained and determined to
show a 1.7-fold increase in activity compared with that of wild-type
MHETase. Second, to remove the steric hindrance effect caused by
F424 located in the inner substrate-binding site and to provide
effective space and potential hydrogen bonding partners for BHET
binding, MHETase
F424N, MHETaseF424V, and MHETaseF424I were
constructed, and the BHET-hydrolysing activities were increased
by ~3.9-, 3.0-, and 3.4-fold, respectively. Combined with the R411K
mutation, the obtained double mutants (MHETase
R411K/F424N,
MHETaseR411K/F424V, and MHETase R411K/F424I) all displayed
improved catalytic activity, especially the MHETaseR411K/S416A/F424I
variant, which exhibited a 15.3-fold increase in BHET hydrolysis
activity. At the same time, MHETase
R411K/F424V, MHETaseR411K/F424I,
and MHETase R411K/S416A/F424I exhibited signi ﬁcantly enhanced
degradation activity against the PET5 oligomer compared with
wild-type MHETase. Although the obtained mutants displayed
no hydrolysing activity against the amorphous PETﬁlm without
a terminus, wild-type MHETase showed degradation activity against
the PETase
S121A/D186H/R280A-treated PET ﬁlm, and

activity. The BHETase activity and the exo-PETase activity of
MHETase were further conﬁrmed by these results.
2.2 Other novel PET hydrolases
2.2.1 PHL7
A novel PET hydrolase (PHL7, ENA accession number:
LT571446, PDB ID: 7NEI) was isolated from plant compost and
is capable of degrading amorphous PETﬁlms and postconsumer
PET with high efﬁciency (Sonnendecker et al., 2022). The overall
structure of PHL7 is almost the same as that of LCC
S165A (PDB ID:
6THS, Figure 12), displaying the typical features of the α/β-
hydrolase fold superfamily with a highly conserved Ser-Asp-His
catalytic triad. It is believed that the similar overall crystal structure
and substrate-binding cavity would lead to similar catalytic
mechanisms. Importantly, the active site pocket of PHL7 is more
open than that of LCC, mainly because of the different
corresponding residues F63, L93, Q95 and I179. This difference
might be helpful for the binding of larger PET substrates and could
be a key to more tolerant recognition and effective processing of PET
at elevated temperatures concomitant with increased polymer chain
mobility.
2.2.2 BgP
Dobson et al. screened 51 marine bacterial isolates for the
discovery of potential ester/polyester hydrolytic catalysts, in
which Brachybacterium ginsengisoli B129SM11 was identi ﬁed
from the deep-sea sponge Pheronema sp .a sap o t e n t i a lP E T -
degrading polyesterase producer ( Carr et al., 2022). Sequence
analysis combined with a genome “mining ” strategy (Almeida
et al., 2019) revealed a putative PET hydrolase (named BgP) that
shares high sequence simi larity with TfCut2 (62%).
Bioinformatics analysis show ed that 54% of the residues in
BgP are identical to Cut190; moreover, 83% of the amino acid
residues displayed similar biochemical properties to those of
Cut190, such as highly conserved features (e.g., α/β fold). A

terminal end by structural analysis, similar to type I PETase. In
addition, Tyr62, a hydrophobic residue, plays a critical role in the
stabilization of the intermediate, and two Ca
2+ binding sites were
identi ﬁed at positions 31 and 37 (site 1 in Cut190) and positions
158 and 160 (site 3 in Cut190).
2.2.3 RgPETase
A novel PET hydrolase from Rhizobacter gummiphilus
(RgPETase) was identiﬁed (Tm, 48.5°C), which displays almost
the same degrading activity against microcrystalline PET but a
signiﬁcantly lower activity compared to that ofIsPETase at 30
°C
(H. Y. Sagong et al., 2021). Crystal structure analysis indicated that
RgPETase shares the key structural features ofIsPETase, such as the
catalytic triad, substrate binding cleft, extendedβ8-α6 connecting
loop, and two disulﬁde bonds (Figure 13A), which might lead to
high PET hydrolysis activity. However, RgPETase also displays
substantial structural differences ( Figures 13B –D), including
variable region 1 (VR1, Q26-S51), the wobbling tryptophan-
containing loop (WW-loop, W183-S187), variable region 2 (VR2,
P207-V228) and the C-terminal region (G271-Y292). These special
structures might contribute to the different behaviours ofRgPETase
toward low-crystalline PET. In particular, the increased activity of
RgPETase
K169A and the decreased activity of RgPETaseE186A and
RgPETaseK169A/E186A showed that the electrostatic charge of the
WW-loop surface or the whole protein surface of RgPETase
might greatly affect its PET-hydrolysing activity.
2.2.4 SM14est
Recently, an in silico -based screening (sequence similarity
search) approach using BLASTP was reported for the screening
of PETase-like enzymes from the genusStreptomyces (Almeida et al.,
2019). From a total of 52 genomes analysed, 3 potential PETase-like
enzymes from marine sponge-associatedStreptomyces isolates were
successfully identi ﬁed, including SM14est from Streptomyces
sp. SM14. Sequence analysis revealed that the serine hydrolase
motif (G-X1-S-X2-G) and the catalytic triad (Ser-Asp-His) are
also conserved in SM14est. Heterologous expression of SM14est
was achieved inE. coliwith the nativeStreptomyces signal peptide,
which was also conﬁrmed to show polyesterase activity by the
polycaprolactone (PCL) plate clearing assay. With a similar
method, a cascade of BLAST searches was applied to identify
potential PETases in the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) terrestrial
metagenome datasets (7,375 samples) (Karunatillaka, Jaroszewski,
and Godzik, 2022).
2.2.5 BbPETase
In recent studies, a novel PET hydrolase fromBurkholderiales
bacterium RIFCSPLOWO2_02_FULL_57_36 ( BbPETase) was
identiﬁed and characterized with an additional N-terminal
domain (BbPETaseAND)( H. Y. Sagong et al., 2022 ; C.C. Chen
Xsy et al., 2021). The Tm values of BbPETaseFull (the full-length
form) andBbPETaseCD (the N-terminal truncated form) were 54°C
and 51°C, respectively. These changes might be responsible the
improved PET hydrolysis activity of BbPETaseFull, and after
3 days, this mutant still displayed 3.5-fold (1.9-fold for
BbPETase
CD) higher activity than that of wild-type IsPETase at
40°C. However, it should be noted that although BbPETaseAND
might play a role in the improved thermostability ofBbPETase,
this domain also showed a detrimental effect on PET hydrolysis.
Especially for the low-crystallinity PET ﬁlm, BbPETaseFull and
BbPETaseCD both exhibited lower activities than IsPETase at
30°C. This might be caused by BbPETaseAND inhibiting the
adhesion of PETase binding to the PET surface. Based on these
ﬁndings, the increased thermostability might be caused by the
additional N-terminal domain, which led to the improved
catalytic activities.
To date, the crystal structure of BbPETase
Full has not been
released, but the detailed structure of BbPETaseCD was obtained
recently (PDB ID: 7CWQ,Figure 14)( C.C. Chen et al., 2021). It is
almost identical to that ofIsPETase and shares most of the key
structural features ofIsPETase, such as the canonicalα/β-hydrolase
fold and the substrate-binding site. Although the substrate-binding
cleft was similar, the different residues on the surface led to slightly
different conformations and surface charge distributions. The L218,
S220, and T338 residues causedBbPETase
CD to form aﬂatter and
more hydrophobic site, and the S335, M363, and N365 residues
resulted in a deeper and narrower substrate-binding cleft. The single
mutants S335N, T338I, M363I, and N365G and the multipoint
Frontiers inBioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org17
Liu et al. 10.3389/fbioe.2023.1263996
mutant BbPETaseS335N/T338I/M363I/N365G (BbPETaseNIIG) were
constructed, and the results showed that the Tm ofBbPETaseNIIG
was increased by 9°C and the PET-degrading activity was increased
by 2.8-fold at 40°C.
However, the crystal structures ofBbPETaseAND or BbPETaseFull
have not been obtained; therefore, the detailed interactions between
BbPETaseAND and BbPETaseCD might be inaccessible. However, it is
certain that the two domains could directly interact with each other.
Moreover, it was shown that S214 and I218 inIsPETase exert a
major inﬂuence on its higher PET-degrading activity at ambient
temperature and substrate speciﬁcity, which are associated with
W185 wobbling andβ6-β7 loopﬂexibility (C.C. Chen et al., 2021).
Sequence analysis revealed that S214 and I218 of IsPETase are
consistently replaced by His and Phe, respectively, in the other
homologues. This special role was further con ﬁrmed by the
improved PET-degrading activities of several IsPETase-like
enzymes with site-directed mutations of His/Phe residues to Ser/Ile.
Although BbPETase shows similar PET-degrading activity
against microcrystalline PET, it displays higher thermostability
than wild IsPETase. Based on detailed structural comparisons
between BbPETase and IsPETase, we generated the
BbPETase
S335N/T338I/M363I/N365G variant with enhanced PET-
degrading activity and thermal stability. We further revealed that
BbPETaseAND contributes to the thermal stability of the enzyme
through close contact with the core domain, but the domain might
hinder the adhesion of the enzyme to the PET substrate.
2.2.6 PE-H
A novel polyester hydrolase (PE-H) from the marine bacterium
Pseudomonas aestusnigriwas identiﬁed as belonging to the type IIa
family of PET hydrolytic enzymes determined by sequence
alignment (Bollinger et al., 2020). Similar to the overall structures
of wild IsPETase, PE-H (Figure 15) is also characterized by a
canonical α/β-fold containing a central twistedβ-sheet composed
of 9β-strands ﬂanked by 7α-helices. In addition, 2 disulﬁde bonds
were identiﬁed in C214-C251 and C285-C302. The main differences
lie in the following four domains (shown inFigure 15, in dark blue):
the loop connecting β3-α2 (DM1), the loop connecting β4-α3
(DM2) positioned parallel to it, the loop connecting β1-β2
(DM3), and the loop connecting β6-β7 (DM4). The positioning
of DM1 and DM2 away from the active site cleft might create more
space for substrate binding.
Considering the effect of Y250 on stabilizing the active site cleft,
a Y250S mutant was constructed that has a much deeper substrate
binding cleft. The results showed a signiﬁcant improvement in the
PET-degrading activity of PE-HY250S even against the PET bottle,
which led to a 45-fold reduction in the amount of MHET released
with the PET bottle as the substrate. Although the crystal structures
of PE-H and PE-H
Y250S (PDB ID:6SCD) are theﬁrst reported type IIa
PET hydrolytic enzymes, it would be dif ﬁcult to illustrate the
detailed catalytic mechanisms without structures of the ligand‒
protein complex.
2.2.7 Mle046
Additionally, in the bacteriumI. sakaiensis, a novel homologue
of the MHETase, Mle046, was recently identiﬁed (Meyer-Cifuentes
and Öztürk, 2021). Mle046 is also a mesophilic enzyme that is able to
rapidly degrade MHET to TPA and, EG at 20°C–40°C. At 30°C, the
Km and kcat values were determined to be 2,638 ± 797 mM [higher
than that of IsMHETase, (7.3 ± 0.6 mM)] and 80.9 ± 15.8 s−1,
respectively. This indicates that it has a lower afﬁnity to MHET.
In addition to MHET, it could also degrade
4-(4-hydroxybutoxycarbonyl) benzoic acid (Bte), which displayed
similar catalytic activity (degradation rate, 0.82 mM s
−1) to that of
MHET (degradation rate, 0.78 mM s−1). Moreover, Mle046 showed
signiﬁcant stability over a broad range of temperatures (10°C–60°C)
and pH values (6.5–9).
3 Strategy for improved PET-
biodegradation
3.1 Cell surface display forIsPETase
In an interesting study, IsPETase and the corresponding
anchoring hydrophobin (HFBI, GenBank KU173825) were
simultaneously displayed on the yeast cell surface for the efﬁcient
biodegradation of highly crystallized PET (hcPET) (Z. Chen, Duan,
et al. 2022b). The hydrophobicity of the yeast cells could be greatly
increased by the displayed HFBI, which would then result in the
obvious attachment of the engineered cells withIsPETase onto the
PET surface (~2-fold increase in the binding numbers of the
engineered cells to PET). The results showed that the catalytic
performance of the engineered whole-cell biocatalyst was
profoundly improved, and hcPET (crystallinity of 45%) was
dramatically increased by ~328.8-fold compared with wild
IsPETase at 30
°C, with a corresponding conversion level for
hcPET of ~10.9% at 30°C within 10 days.
The special catalytic mechanism makes MHETase much more
operational in the biodegradation of PET waste. In a study,
engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae expressing the MHETase
enzyme was used to develop a whole-cell catalyst for ef ﬁcient
bioconversion of MHET into TPA and, EG ( Loll-Krippleber
et al., 2022). Efﬁcient MHETase expression with different display
partners on the yeast cell surface was achieved, and MHETase-Aga2
and MHETase-Sed1 showed the highest displayed fraction protein
and MHETase-Aga2 displayed the protein abundance (4.8 nM for
10
8 cell/mL suspensions). The MHETase whole-cell biocatalysts
showed clearly different catalytic activities, and MHETase-Tip1
displayed the highest reaction rate against MpNPT. MHETase-
Tip1 could also efﬁciently hydrolyse MHET, releasing TPA, and
after 24 h, all MHET (400 nM) was converted to TPA. However, no
TPA was catalysed by the intracellular MHETase chimaera even
after 24 h, which indicates that MHET was hydrolysed
extracellularly. However, lower substrate af ﬁnity and catalytic
efﬁciency (with a 15.7-fold greater k
m and a 0.68-fold lower kcat)
were also observed and concluded to be caused by ectopic
glycosylation, the special environment of the yeast cell surface, or
large protein fusion. In contrast, the constructed whole-cell catalysts
were conﬁrmed to be active for more than 12 days and stay active up
to 45
°C.
Recently, a hydrophobic cell surface display (HCSD) system in
E. coliwas developed for the construction of an efﬁcient whole-cell
PET-degrading catalyst (Jia et al., 2022). In this method, the FadL
protein was used for the display of PETase; moreover, the
hydrophobic protein HFBII was displayed on the surface of
Frontiers inBioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org18
Liu et al. 10.3389/fbioe.2023.1263996
Escherichia colifor increased PET accessibility. The results revealed
that the HCSD showed a clear degrading effect on PET, leading to
much rougher surfaces with greater hydrophilicity and a water
contact angle of 68.4 ± 1
°, which was signiﬁcantly lower than
that of untreated PET (106.1 ± 2 °). In addition, the HCSD
system displayed satisfactory thermostability and processing
stability, with 73% activity retained at 40°C for 7 days and 70%
activity maintained after 7 cycles. Compared with whole-cell
immobilization, the HCSD system exhibits more advantages for
efﬁcient PET degradation.
In addition to the widely used model hostE. coli, Pichia pastoris
(P. pastoris) has long been considered one of the most versatile
platforms for the production of various heterologous proteins,
including industrial enzymes. Recently, a whole-cell biocatalyst
was developed by displaying PETase on the surface ofP. pastoris
to improve the PET-degrading efﬁciency (Z. Chen, Wang, et al.,
2020b). The results showed that compared with free PETase, the
obtained whole-cell biocatalyst had enhanced pH and
thermostability. Moreover, the turnover rate of the whole-cell
biocatalyst against hc-PET was signi ﬁcantly improved by ~36-
fold compared with that of free PETase. In particular, the
catalytic performance remained stable after 7 repeated uses, even
against commercial hc-PET bottles.
3.2 Engineering ofIsPETase through
different secretory expression systems
Given the appearance of abundant N- and O-linked
glycosylation sites in IsPETase, it is interesting to investigate
whether posttranslational glycosylation participates in the
catalytic activity and thermostability ofIsPETase. In one study, it
was shown that IsPETase could be successfully deglycosylated by
endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo H, EC3.2.1.96), and the
thermostability of the recombinant protein (IsPETase-Pp) could be
further elevated. The optimal temperature was increased to 50°C
higher than that of wildIsPETase; moreover, it retained ~90% of its
initial activity after a 2-h incubation at 50°C( Deng et al., 2023). The
partially deglycosylated IsPETase-Pp (further deglycosylated by
Endo H after Ni-NTA afﬁnity chromatography puriﬁcation) was
determined to be stable at 40°C with no activity lost after heat
treatment for 12 h, and it retained more than 40% of its initial
activity at 50
°C after heat treatment for 6 h. These results
demonstrated the higher thermostability of IsPETase-Pp
compared to the wild-type IsPETase expressed by E. coli
(IsPETase-Ec). In addition, the catalytic activity of IsPETase-Pp
was further increased by ~3-fold (from 20.6 U/mg to 62.4 U/mg)
after deglycosylation, which was also much higher than that of
IsPETase-Ec (~1.8 U/mg). Structure analysis showed that N-linked
modiﬁcation sites were mainly detected at N114, N138, N212,
N264 and N288 on the loops of the protein surface. After Endo
H cleavage, the long polysaccharide chains were removed from
IsPETase-Pp, leaving a GlcNAc residue, which might play critical
roles in the increased thermostability.
Although it is widely accepted that the covalent binding of glycans
to the protein surface could further improve the thermostability and
catalytic stability of the target protein, the mechanism of the enhanced
activity of glycosylated and partially deglycosylatedIsPETase-Pp has not
been clearly elucidated (Shental-Bechor and Levy, 2008). It should be
noted that the substrate-binding sites of PET-degrading enzymes are
usually located on the protein surface, and bulky N-linked glycans
probably inhibit the interactions between the substrate and the
enzymes.
In another study (Kosiorowska et al., 2022), it was shown thatY.
lipolytica could also be used for the efﬁcient heterologous expression
of IsPETase, and the engineered host was able to degrade PETﬁlm
directly with the release of ~23 mg L
−1 MHET after 96 h in culture.
Moreover, the results showed that 1% olive oil addition could greatly
improve the PET hydrolysis ef ﬁciency, and the highest
concentration of released TPA reached 124 mg L
−1. It was also
found that the addition of 2.5 mM MnSO 4 alone or 1 mM
CuSO4 alone could signiﬁcantly improve the hydrolysis of PET;
however, no positive effects on the degradation process were
conﬁrmed when the cultures contained 1 mM and 2.5 mM
MnSO4, 1 mM CuSO4, and 1% olive oil. Furthermore, it was
highlighted that Yarrowia lipolytica was capable of assimilating
ethylene glycol and accumulating TPA with PET powder as the
substrate.
The secretion of IsPETase from E. coli has been achieved by
using sec-dependent signal peptides (SP), such as the maltose/
maltodextrin binding periplasmic protein (SP
MalE), maltoporin
(SPLamB)( Seo et al. 2019), and SPPelB (Shi et al. 2021). With
SPLamB, 6.2 mg of IsPETase per 1 L of culture medium was
produced, and ~1.7-fold more secretion ofIsPETase was achieved
by engineered SPPelB via random mutagenesis. In another study,
E. coli BL21 (DE3) was also selected for increased secretion of
IsPETase by SP engineering (L. Cui, Qiu, et al., 2021a). Three SP
enhancers, B1 (MERACVAV), B2 (MDKACVAV) and B3
(MAERACVAV), were rationally designed and fused to the
N-terminus of the widely used SP (PelB, MalE, LamB, and
OmpA) to mediate the excretion of IsPETase. The results
revealed that B1, B2 and B3 could all dramatically promote the
secretion ofIsPETase inE. coli, among which SP
B1PelB displayed the
strongest potential. Compared with that of PelB, the excreted
IsPETase was increased by 62-fold, and the highest concentration
was ~650 mg/L when induced by IPTG and L-arabinose. The
hydrolysis of PET ﬁlm by crude and puriﬁed IsPETase was also
enhanced after treatment for 42 h, and the released water-soluble
products were 58.3 mg/L and 41.5 mg/L, respectively. Moreover, the
release of water-soluble products ofIsPETase catalysis increased by
2.7-fold when the PETﬁlm was preincubated with the hydrophobin
HFBII. This study provided an easy and convenient method for the
biodegradation of PET with the widely used hostE. coli.
In a similar study, a higher-throughput PETase engineering
platform was developed (Zurier and Goddard, 2023), which includes
secretory expression andﬂuorescent product detection. First, YebF-
mediated PETase secretion (N-terminal YebF fusion) enables near-
parallel expression in microplates, and then, ferric iron oxidation
(50 mM FeSO
4 +500 mM EDTA, pH 8.5) of PET-degrading
products results in ﬂuorophores (BHET-OH, MHET-OH, and
TPA-OH) that enable rapid activity quantiﬁcation. Therefore, it
could not only eliminate the lysis and puriﬁcation steps but also
permit high-throughput screening of potential PETases. With this
method, a library of 54 single point mutations with predicted effects
was constructed and screened for positive mutants, which led to a
sublibrary of 12 single-point mutants displaying signi ﬁcantly
Frontiers inBioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org19
Liu et al. 10.3389/fbioe.2023.1263996
improved PET-degrading activity. It was estimated that the
increased activities might be caused by the increased overall
stability through the additional intramolecular interactions. Then,
the 12 identiﬁed positive mutants were combined into 57 double
mutants for the screening of higher PETase activity in the next
round. This led to the discovery of 9 double mutants showing
synergistic effects with signiﬁcantly higher T
m values. Finally, a
combinatorial approach was used to optimize PETase activity with
the obtained multimutants for 10 days.
The results revealed that SR-PETase
(IsPETase
A47S/T51A/A74P/V134T/G139N/R280L/N288R) showed the highest
thermostability, released 1.9-fold more degradation products, and
had ~7.4-fold higher activity than wild-typeIsPETase at 40
°C after
10 days. This clearly demonstrates the practicability of applying this
high-throughput platform for efﬁcient PETase engineering. In a
similar study byK. Liu et al. (2023), a dualﬂuorescence assay was
developed for high-throughput screening for potential PETases. In
this method, mutants areﬁrst expressed in deep 96-well plates as
fusion proteins with a deep redﬂuorescent protein (mCarmine),
which is bene ﬁcial to the rapid quantitative assay of enzyme
concentrations in a 96-well plate (Plate 1). Second, a speciﬁc 96-
well plate (Plate 2) was prepared by coating mixed PETﬂuorogenic
probes (FPs) on the bottoms of each well. Finally, transferring an
appropriate amount of crude cell lysate from Plate 1 to Plate
2 facilitated the degradation of PET along with rapid
cohydrolysis of freed FP to green ﬂuorescein as an indicator of
PET hydrolysis, which could then be quantiﬁed and determined.
With this method, a library of 2,850 mutants with an average of 1-
7 amino acid substitutions constructed by error-prone PCR was
screened, and the results revealed that through two-round screening,
6 improved variants with 1.3–4.9-fold improved activities were
successfully identi ﬁed. Although slightly complicated, this
screening strategy provides another practical alternative for the
discovery of potential PETases.
To further improve the soluble expression levels for the
efﬁcient production of IsPETase, cytoplasmic overexpression in
E. coli was also investigated ( Son et al., 2019 ). In addition,
strategies of coexpression with chaperones GroEL/ES and
N-terminal NusA-tag fused expression were also explored in
E. coli (Aer et al., 2022 ). The results showed that GroEL/ES
could signi ﬁcantly facilitate the overexpression of soluble
IsPETase
Mut at 25°Ca n d3 0°C, with the highest improvement
of ~12.5-fold observed at 25°C. This is also true for the superior
soluble expression ability of NusA at 25 °C, with the highest
increase in soluble expression reaching ~4.6-fold. Although
NusA- IsPETase
Mut and IsPETase Mut (GroEL/ES) displayed
little improvement in thermostability, NusA- IsPETase Mut
showed an ~ 1.5-fold improvement in enzyme activity at
pH 9.0. After 2 weeks, a 1.4-fold higher release of soluble
TPA, MHET, and BHET (with a much higher amount of
MHET) catalysed by NusA- IsPETase
Mut w a so b t a i n e di nt h e
biodegradation of PET.
As mentioned above, it has been shown that electrostatic
interactions play an important role in the protein thermostability
of PETase. Recently, an electrostatic interaction-based strategy was
developed for the rational design of IsPETase with improved
catalytic performance, especially thermostability. Based on
structural analysis, the domains with high B-factor and RMSF
(with higher ﬂexibility) were selected for site-directed mutations,
including the positions lined with W156-N161 and E245-R251. The
strategy consists of three main steps, including the introduction of a
positive charge (S92R and S92K), the substitution of a negative
charge (S92R/K + D157E, I139R/K + D157E), and the introduction
of the R251A mutation. The results showed that IsPETase
I139R
displayed the highest thermostability with a Tm value of 56.37°C,
which was suggested to be caused by reasonable electrostatic
interaction with a favourable N-O distance (~2.7 Å).
When applied for the biodegradation of high-crystallinity PET
(hcPET) at 30
°C, IsPETaseS92R and IsPETaseS92K/R251A displayed
better catalytic performance, and the PET-degrading activities
were improved by 1.4-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively. The
hydrolytic activity of IsPETase
S92K/R251A was further improved by
3.6-fold at 40°C. In particular, it was found that the only PET
hydrolysis product catalysed by IsPETaseS92K/D157E/R251A was TPA,
and after 72 h, the TPA yield was increased by 3.02-fold compared
with that of the wild type. Additionally, IsPETase
S92K/R251A and
IsPETaseI139R displayed distinctly improved thermostability and
retained over 60% relative activity for 24 h of inactivation at
40
°C. Molecular simulations con ﬁrmed that the added
electrostatic interaction could ef ﬁciently stabilize the target
ﬂexible region and lead to global structural stabilization.
Especially at higher temperatures, this effect becomes more
signiﬁcant (Schwaminger et al., 2021).
3.3 Immobilization of PETase enzymes
Recently, an interesting bienzymatic cascade system (DuP-
M@CaP, 1.5 μm) was constructed for the coimmobilization of
DuraPETase and MHETase throu gh the SpyTag/SpyCatcher
system (K. Chen, Dong, and Sun, 2022c). SpyTag/SpyCatcher
(Spy) chemistry shows great po tential in multienzymatic
cascade reactions with improv ed catalytic performance, in
which SpyTag can spontaneously form stable iso-peptide
bonds with SpyCatcher. In this study, MHETase-SpyCatcher
was ﬁrst embedded in calcium phosphate nanocrystals (CaP)
via biomimetic mineralization, and then DuraPETase-SpyTag
was conjugated on the surf ace. DuP-M@CaP displayed
signi ﬁcantly improved thermostability and pH stability; at
50
°C, the residual enzyme activity of DuP-M@CaP wase
maintained at 87.7% after incubation for 4 h. After 6 days for
PET degradation, the degrading ef ﬁciencies of DuP-M@CaP
were increased by 9.7-fold and 5.2-fold at 40
°Ca n d5 0°C,
respectively, and in a 10-day degradation of PET ﬁlm, 50.3%
weight losses were achieved at 50°C. As expected, the improved
stabilities and the speci ﬁc spatial distribution of the
immobilized enzymes contribu ted to the superior catalytic
performance of DuP-M@CaP.
3.4 Enhancing PET hydrolytic activity with
fused functional domains
The increased accessibility of PET-degrading enzymes towards
the highly hydrophobic surface of PET is also important for rapid
and efﬁcient PET hydrolysis (C.C. Chen, Dai, et al., 2020a). In

Liu et al. 10.3389/fbioe.2023.1263996
addition to modulating protein evolution, the strategy of
constructing fusion proteins has also been proven to be effective
in enhancing the binding afﬁnity of enzymes and substrates with
hydrophobic surface binding modules (D. Ribitsch et al., 2013; D.
Ribitsch et al., 2015; Várnai et al., 2014).
3.4.1 Carbohydrate-binding module (CBM)-fused
PETase
Carbohydrate-binding modules (CBMs) are small noncatalytic
protein domains that usually function as a part of modular enzymes
(e.g., carbohydrate-active enzymes, CAZymes) and are capable of
enhancing the binding afﬁnity between enzymes and substrates
(Armenta et al., 2017; Weber et al., 2019). Consequently, CBMs
have been used as efﬁcient afﬁnity tags for protein immobilization
owing to their high adsorption capacity for solid substrates (Oliveira
et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2020). Based on the topology of the ligand-
binding site, CBMs can be classiﬁed into types A, B (endo-type), or C
(exo-type) (Gilbert, Knox, and Boraston, 2013). Type A CBMs
display a high binding capacity to crystalline polysaccharides
(e.g., cellulose and chitin) through hydrophobic interactions
regulated by conserved aromatic triplets and are therefore
considered potential candidates for PET-binding peptides (Zhang
et al., 2013; Y. Liu, Wang, et al., 2022b).
Joanna et al. reported the identiﬁcation of a novel PET-binding
CBM, and the CBM-PET interactions were explored (Weber et al.,
2019). First, a semiquantitative PET surface af ﬁnity assay was
developed to detect CBMs bound to PET ﬁlms. Then, eight
CBMs from the carbohydrate active enzymes database ( http://
www.cazy.org/, CAZy database) ( Drula et al., 2022 ) were
screened for PET binding, and the results showed thatBaCBM2
(GenBank accession numbers: ACQ50287/MK349005) possessed
the strongest afﬁnity towards PET. Molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations were used investigate the CBM-PET interactions and
identiﬁed an aromatic triad (Trp9/Trp44/Trp63) on the peptide
surface that was also stabilized by π-stacking interactions and
hydrogen bonds. This was further veri ﬁed by tryptophan
quenching experiments and alanine point mutations; moreover,
the strength of PET binding of CBMs was found to be largely
determined by the ratio of hydrophobic to polar contacts at the
interface.
Andrew et al. investigated the binding ofBaCBM2 for PET in
detail and showed that the binding afﬁnity is highly associated with
the temperature and crystallinity (Rennison, Westh, and Møller,
2023). With increasing in tested temperatures, the general trend of
K
d increased ﬁrst and then declined. At ~40°C, a maximumKd of
408 nM forBaCBM2 was detected, showing an obviously lower
afﬁnity for this PET substrate. At low temperatures, the increased
binding afﬁnity might be caused by a gain in entropy caused by
dehydration of the binding surface; nevertheless, at higher
temperatures, it might result from the increase in crystalline
regions on the PET surface. At 20
°C, there is a clear trend of
higher afﬁnity at higher crystallinity, and a signiﬁcant increase in
afﬁnity was seen as ~ 20% bulk crystallinity. This indicated that
BaCBM2 might bind preferentially to crystalline areas on the PET
surface. MD studies indicated that the binding is mainly driven by
the critical residues W9, W44 and W63 through a gain in entropy
caused by the dehydration of the binding surface. In my opinion,
fusing a polymer-binding module to the PET hydrolase is a
promising strategy to streamline the enzymatic hydrolysis of
PET, however the binding capacity, afﬁnity, and thermostability
should be improved to satisfy the needs of industrial operation.
To improve the PET-degrading capacity ofIsPETase, different
polymer-binding domains (CBM of cellobiohydrolase I from
Trichoderma reesei, PBM, and HFB4) were selected and fused to
the C-terminus of the IsPETase
S121E/D186H/R280A (IsPETaseEHA)
mutant (Dai, Qu, Huang, et al., 2021b). The results demonstrated
that CBM fused to IsPETaseEHA showed the most signi ﬁcant
stimulatory effect on the enzymatic hydrolysis of PET with
30.7 μM soluble products (TPA and MHET) released, which was
increased by ~71.5% at 30
°C. In contrast, the catalytic activity was
found to be strongly inhibited by the fused PBM (poly (3-
hydroxybutyrate)–binding domain of PHB depolymerase fromR.
pickettii). However, at 40
°C, only IsPETaseEHA_CBM showed
improved catalytic efﬁciency with a total amount of 251.5 μM
released products (increased by ~44.5%). This positive effect was
reduced by the N-terminus fused protein, which indicates that the
orientation of the substrate binding domain plays a critical role in
the catalytic activity of the fused protein.
3.4.2 Hydrophobin-fused PETase
In addition to the CBM, hydrophobins are also believed to
improve the catalytic performance of PETase. They are highly
surface-active proteins capable of spontaneously self-assembling
at hydrophilic-hydrophobic interfaces, which are proven to be
important for interface engineering (Berger and Sallada, 2019).
Puspitasari et al. investigated the effects of the class I
hydrophobin RolA from Aspergillus oryzae and HGFI from
Grifola frondose on PETase-catalysed PET hydrolysis (Puspitasari,
Tsai, and Lee, 2021a). The results showed that PET pretreatment
with RolA or HGFI could all accelerate PETase hydrolysis against
PET with more soluble monomers released. After pretreatment, the
weight loss of hydrolysed PET increased from ~18% to 34%;
moreover, for the HGFI-modiﬁed PET ﬁbre (crystallinity, 38.8%),
the weight loss reached 34.56% after 5 days. However, no signiﬁcant
enhancement was detected when the simultaneous addition of
hydrophobins with PETase was used for PET degradation. This
ﬁnding was contrary to that obtained with class II hydrophobins
(Espino-Rammer et al., 2013); therefore, this stimulation effect
caused by hydrophobins should be further examined in detail. In
the subsequent study, RolA was found to be able to enhance the PET
hydrolysis of a PET bottle, and the highest weight loss was
determined to be ~26% after 4 days (Puspitasari, Tsai, and Lee,
2021b).
In a recent study, a zwitterionic polypeptide (5 –30 kDa)
consisting of alternating-charged glutamic acid (E) and lysine (K)
residues was fused to the C-terminus of PETase (X. Chen, 2021). The
results highlighted that the lengths of the fusion peptide play a clear
role in the PET-degrading performance, and PETase-EK30 (T
m =
45.4°C ± 0.21°C) was found to display the highest catalytic activity
(increased by 11-fold compared with the wild-type PETase) against
the highly crystallized PETﬁlms (crystallinity, 45.2%). After 5 days,
the concentration of products released by PETase-EK30 at 40
°C
against AGf-PET was further increased to 303.2μM, 9.4-fold higher
than that released by wild-type PETase. Molecular modelling
revealed a strengthened structural stability and a more open
substrate-binding pocket of the EKylated PETases. MD
Frontiers inBioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org21
Liu et al. 10.3389/fbioe.2023.1263996
simulations indicate that the improved catalytic activity might result
from the exposure of hydrophobic amino acids (W185, I208, and
W159, a more open substrate-binding site), rotation of the benzene
ring of Y87, and a shortened catalytic distance between the labile
carbonyl carbon atom of 2PET and the hydroxy oxygen of the
catalytic S160 caused by the EKylation. All these are believed to be
associated with the enhanced catalytic activity for PET degradation.
In addition, the noncatalytic polysaccharide monooxygenase
was shown to be capable of binding to relatively ﬂat
polysaccharide surfaces similar to CBMs ( Hangasky, Detomasi,
and Marletta, 2019), which might contribute to binding to the
PET surface. In one study, it was reported that the lytic
polysaccharide monooxygenase from Pycnoporus coccineus
(PcAA14A) could also facilitate IsPETase-catalysed PET
degradation (Dai, Qu, Hu, et al., 2021a). The results showed that
PcAA14A alone was unable to degrade PET; however, the PET
degradation products were increased to 534 ± 24.3μM when treated
with PcAA14A andIsPETase simultaneously, which was increased
by 59.2% compared with that catalysed byIsPETase alone. Even in
the absence of ascorbate and H
2O2 (necessary for the catalytic
functions of PcAA14A) or with the inactive mutant
PcAA14A
H100A, similar ﬁndings could also be obtained with
588 ± 13.5μM, 490 ± 13.5μM, 490 ± 26.5μM products detected.
This reveals the synergistic effects of PcAA14A andIsPETase in PET
hydrolysis, which might be unrelated to the catalytic activity of
PcAA14. After 5 days, under the optimal conditions, PET was
degraded, releasing 1,097 μM products, which was increased by
27.7% compared with that produced by IsPETase alone. These
interesting ﬁndings provide novel insights into the design of
promising enzymatic machineries for PET biodegradation.
4 Discussion and conclusion
The plastic crisis is a global challenge that requires urgent
intervention and a concerted eff o r tt h a tl i n k sp a r t n e r sa c r o s s
industrial, academic,ﬁnancial, and government sectors. Enzymatic
hydrolysis of PET, as a green and sustainable alternative, has
captured great importance and interest worldwide. This strategy is
considered as an environmentally friendly strategy for the recycling of
post-consumer PET wastes. While progress on the PET-biodegradation
has been made, there are still challenges to overcome in developing
effective and scalable methods for biodegrading PET. Currently, it is the
main challenge to discover and identify potential polymer-active
enzymes acting on speciﬁc or different fossil-fuel-based plastics in
nature or by molecular engineeringof the existing enzymes. It is still
imperative to further improve the thermostability of the used PETases
(or PETase-like enzymes), which usually function poorly at glassy
transition temperature. Though several promising PETase mutants
have been reported (e.g., HotPETase, ThermoPETase and
DuraPETase), molecular engineering of PETases for improved
stability and PET-degrading activity simultaneously still remains a
challenge but a promising strategy.
Besides, currently the mixed plastic fractions are usually difﬁcult
to recycle, however the microbial metabolism might open novel
grounds with the rapid development of synthetic biology and
metabolic engineering. Highly ef ﬁcient microbial cell factories
with modi ﬁed genetic circuits would not only provide a
promising strategy for PET degradation, but enable the polymer
upcycling. For the upcycling strategy, the hydrolysed fragments or
depolymerized monomers (e.g., as, EG, TPA) could then be used as
substrates or carbon sources to produce value-added compounds
such as isoprene and caprolactam. Though promising, it requires a
systems-based and multidisciplinary strategy to achieve this
purpose. In addition, it is necessary to determine, and cope with
the factors contributing to the costs of PET-biodegradation, such as
the biore ﬁnery processes of the plastic wastes, industrialized
fermentation and puri ﬁcation of the PET-degrading catalysts,
protein engineering for improved catalytic performance and so on.
As emphasized in this review, it is believed that effective
enzymes with enhanced thermostability and degradation
performance combined with the rapidly developing synthetic
biology and metabolic engineering tools would further streamline
PET upcycling processes.
