Abstract
Rapid biocatalytic process development and intensification continues to be challenging
with currently available methods. Chiral amino-alcohols are of particular interest as
they represent key industrial synthons for the production of complex molecules and
optically pure pharmaceuticals. (2S,3R)-2-amino-1,3,4-butanetriol (ABT), a building
block for the synthesis of protease inhibitors and detoxifying agents, can be
synthesized from simple, non-chiral starting materials, by coupling a transketolase-
and a transaminase-catalyzed reaction. However, until today, full conversion has not
been shown and, typically, long reaction times are reported, making process
modifications and improvement challenging. In this contribution, we present a novel
microreactor-based approach based on free enzymes, and we report for the first time
full conversion of ABT in a coupled enzyme cascade for both batch and continuous-
flow systems. Using the compartmentalization of the reactions afforded by the
microreactor cascade, we overcame inhibitory effects, increased the activity per unit
volume, and optimized individual reaction conditions. The transketolase-catalyzed
reaction was completed in under 10 min with a volumetric activity of 3.25 U ml
−1.
Following optimization of the transaminase-catalyzed reaction, a volumetric activity of
10.8 U ml−1 was attained which led to full conversion of the coupled reaction in 2 hr.
The presented approach illustrates how continuous-flow microreactors can be applied
for the design and optimization of biocatalytic processes.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Expeditious and stereoselective synthetic methodologies for chiral
amino-alcohols from simple starting materials are of significant interest
(Shi, Wong, & Buchwald, 2016; Weinstein, Schuman, Tan, & Stahl,
2013). Chiral amino-alcohol moieties occur naturally in a large number
of biologically active compounds and are synthesized for various
applications such as new-to-nature pharmaceuticals, key industrial
synthons for the production of complex molecules and optically pure
pharmaceuticals, that is, HIV protease inhibitors (Kaldor et al., 1997;
Kwon & Ko, 2002) or ephedrine-type structures produced via multi-
step reactions as recently described by Sehl, Maugeri, and Rother
(2015a).
Chiral amino-triols in particular represent important structural
elements in sphingosine-like metabolites such as myriocin, which
inhibits serine palmitoyl transferase and thereby ceramide and
sphingolipid biosynthesis (Miyake, Kozutsumi, Nakamura, Fujita, &
Kawasaki, 1995). Myriocin was discovered to have antifungal
activity (Kluepfel et al., 1972), strong immunosuppressant activity
and provided a scaffold for the development of the synthetic
analogue FTY720, leading to fingolimod as the first orally
applicable treatment of multiple sclerosis (Chun & Brinkmann,
2011). It has been estimated that up to 50% of all pharmaceuticals
contain a chiral amine in their structure (Ghislieri & Turner, 2014;
Zhu & Hua, 2009). In addition, chiral amino-alcohols represent
useful building blocks for the pr eparation of chiral catalysts,
ligands, and auxiliaries in asymmetric synthesis (Birrell & Jacobsen,
2013).
Chemical routes for the production of these compounds
typically require the use of protecting groups, expensive transition
metal catalysts and multiple steps for intermediate and final
product recovery and purification (Ghislieri & Turner, 2014;
Tamura, Tamura, Takeda, Nakagawa, & Tomishige, 2014). In
contrast, biocatalytic routes for the synthesis of chiral amino-
alcohols offer an attractive and robust alternative due to their
environmentally benign nature and high selectivity (Höhne &
Bornscheuer, 2009; Ward & Wohlgemuth, 2010; Wohlgemuth,
2010). Enzymes for the synthesis of chiral amino-alcohols include
imine reductases (Leipold, Hussain, Ghislieri, & Turner, 2013),
amino acid dehydrogenases (Zh u & Hua, 2009), transaminases,
lyases, and monoamine oxidases (Ghislieri & Turner, 2014; Höhne
& Bornscheuer, 2009). Although transaminases with high substrate
regio- and stereoselectivity have been found, their application is
often constrained by unfavorable reaction equilibria and substrate
and/or product inhibition (Rios-Solis et al., 2015; Stewart, 2001;
T a y l o r ,P a n t a l e o n e ,S e n k p e i l ,&F o t h e r i n g h a m ,1 9 9 8 ;V i l l e g a s -
Torres et al., 2015). These constraints require careful consideration
in biocatalytic process development. This becomes an even more
demanding task where more than one enzymatic reaction step is
required in the synthesis of the chiral amino-alcohols.
Performing organic synthesis in structured microreactors offers a
number of advantages, including increased control over the reaction
conditions (i.e., reaction time, flow rate, and reagent addition), reduced
use of resources, faster mass and heat transport due to the high
surface-to-volume ratios and shortened diffusion path lengths. In the
specific case of multi-enzyme reactions, microreactors offer straight-
forward and efficient compartmentalization of the reactions (Gruber,
Marques, O'Sullivan et al., 2017). Furthermore, reaction and separation
steps can be combined (O'Sullivan et al., 2012) and throughput can be
increased via parallelization of the microreactors (Bolivar, Wiesbauer,
& Nidetzky, 2011; Krühne et al., 2014; Wohlgemuth, Plazl,Žnidaršič-
Plazl, Gernaey, & Woodley, 2015). These advantages may lead to faster
biocatalytic process development or the creation of novel synthetic
routes, while at the same time reducing cost and environmental
impact.
In this contribution, we investigate a novel approach for the 2-
step-enzymatic synthesis of the chiral amino-triol (2S,3R)-2-amino-
1,3,4-butanetriol (ABT) based on coupled microreactors. ABT is used
as a building block for statins employed in the synthesis of the HIV-
protease inhibitor Nelfinavir (Kaldor et al., 1997; Kwon & Ko, 2002)
and as an intermediate in the synthesis of detoxinine, a detoxifying
agent for reducing the toxicity of the antibiotic treatment for rice
blast disease (Delle Monache et al., 1999; Ingram et al., 2007). In this
work, ABT is obtained by coupling a transketolase (TK)-catalyzed
asymmetric carbon-carbon bond formation with a transaminase
(TAm)-catalyzed conversion of the keto-group into a chiral amino
group (Scheme 1) (Ingram et al., 2007; Rios-Solis et al., 2011;
Villegas-Torres et al., 2015). We show, for the first time, a
microreactor-based reaction cascade with free enzymes and we
obtained for the first time full conversion of this reaction sequence
in both continuous-flow microreactors and in batch. Halim, Rios-
Solis, Micheletti, Ward, and Lye (2014) also achieved full conversion
in microtiter plates for the TAm-catalyzed reaction, however,
needed a secondary reaction to drive the reaction equilibrium, and
used purified erythrulose (ERY) as a starting material, thus did not
perform a coupled reaction. Furthermore, the compartmentalization
afforded by our microreactor cascade led to the discovery that a
cofactor of the TK reaction inhibits the TAm, which was not
previously reported. These advances reinforce the potential of
coupled microreactors for biocatalytic process development (Gruber,
Marques, O'Sullivan et al., 2017; Marques & Szita, 2017).

Unless otherwise stated, all chemicals and reagents were purchased
from Sigma–Aldrich (Gillingham, UK) and were used without further
purification.
2.1 | Analytical methods
2.1.1 | Protein quantification

2.1.2 | Enzyme activity
Transketolase activity measurement
Quantification was carried out in 96-well microtiter plates by adding
150 μl of transketolase (TK) lysate solution (15μl of TK lysate, 2.4 mM
thiamine diphosphate, ThDP, and 9.8 mM MgCl2) to 150 μlo fa
solution of 100 mM hydroxypyruvate (HPA) and 100 mM glycolalde-
hyde (GA). Both solutions were prepared in 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.0
and incubated at 20°C for 30 min. Using a sacrificial well approach,
samples of 50μl were removed each minute for 5 min and quenched
with 450 μl 0.1% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), centrifuged
(5,000 rpm, 5 min) and analyzed by HPLC. One transketolase unit
(U) was defined as the amount of transketolase which catalyzed the
conversion of 1μmol of substrate per minute at pH 7.0 and 20°C.
Transaminase activity measurement
Quantification was carried out in 96-well microtiter plates by adding
20 μl of transaminase (TAm) (1:10 diluted) solution containing 1 mM
pyridoxal-5′-phosphate (PLP) to a 180μl solution of 10 mM (S)-α-
methylbenzylamine (MBA) and 10 mM sodium pyruvate (PYR). Both
solutions were prepared in 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.4 and incubated at
20°C for 30 min. Acetophenone (AP) formation was recorded for 2 min
in 20 s interval using a plate reader (FLUOstar OPTIMA, BMG Labtech,
Ortenberg, Germany) at 280 nm. For activity determination of TAm
extracted into pH 9 Tris–HCl buffer, all solutions were prepared at pH
9 accordingly. One transaminase unit (U) was defined as the amount of
transaminase that catalyzed the formation of 1μmol of product (AP)
per minute at pH 7.4 and pH 9, respectively, and 20°C.
2.1.3 | Reagent analysis by HPLC
HPA and ERY were analyzed directly using an Aminex HPX-87H
column (300 mm × 7.8 mm; Bio-Rad, Hemel Hempstead, UK) with
0.6 ml min
−1 isocratic elution of 0.1% (v/v) TFA at 60°C and detection
at 210 nm. MBA and AP were quantified with an ACE 5 C18 RP column
(150 mm × 4.6 mm, 5μm particle size, Advance Chromatography
Technologies, Aberdeen, UK). The mobile phase was comprised of
0.1% (v/v) TFA at 1.0 ml min
−1 with a gradient of acetonitrile from 15%
to 72% over 9 min, followed by a 2 min equilibration and detection
at 254 nm. 2-Amino-1,3,4-butanetriol (ABT) was derivatized by
diluting the samples with 0.2 M borate buffer pH 8.8 and adding an
excess of 6-aminoquinolyl-N-hydroxysuccinimidyl carbamate. ABT
was quantified using an ACE 5 C18 RP column (150 mm × 4.6 mm,
5 μm, Advanced Chromatography Technologies) with a mobile phase
comprised of 140 mM sodium acetate buffer (adjusted to pH 5 using
acetic acid) at 0.5 ml min
−1 with a gradient of acetonitrile from 85%
to 100% over 10 min, followed by a column wash phase and
re-equilibrium step at 1 ml min−1 and detection at 254 nm. ABT
for calibration purposes was synthesized according to Ingram et al.
(2007).
2.2 | Fabrication of microreactor and micromixer
All components were designed using Solidworks® (Dassault Systems,
Velizy-Villacoublay Cedex, France). The microreactor and the micro-
mixer were comprised of two rigid poly(methylmethacrylate) (PMMA)
layers; 1.5 mm thick for the microreactor layers, and 2 mm thick for the
micromixer layers. The channels and cut-outs were fabricated using a
CO
2 laser marking head (Epilog Laser, Clevedon, UK) and the layers
were thermally bonded by clamping together at 400 cNm2 for 45 min
at 110°C. Standard connection fittings (P-221, Upchurch Scientific,
Oak Harbour, WA) were used to attach polytetrafluoroethylene tubing
(PTFE, ID 0.75 mm, VWR International Ltd, Lutterworth, UK).
2.3 | Biocatalyst preparation
2.3.1 | Strains and plasmids
Transketolase (WT-TK fromEscherichia coliBL21gold DE3 containing
the plasmid pQR791) (Martinez-Torres, Aucamp, George, & Dalby,
2007) and ω-transaminase producing strains (CV2025 from E. coli
BL21gold DE3 containing the plasmid pQR801) (Kaulmann, Smithies,
Smith, Hailes, & Ward, 2007) were produced in-house and stored at
-80°C in LB broth containing 50% (v/v) glycerol.
2.3.2 | Culture conditions and enzyme expression
Transketolase
Overnight cultures were prepared in 10 g L−1 LB broth supplemented with
150 µg ml−1 ampicillin and 10 g L−1 glycerol. Cells were sub-cultured using
1% (v/v) inoculum in 2 L shake flasks containing 500 ml of the same
supplemented LB broth at 37°C and 250 rpm until the bacterial growth
reached stationary phase. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at
8,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C.

Transaminase
Overnight cultures were prepared in 10 g L−1 LB broth supplemented
with 30 µg ml−1 kanamycin and 10 g L−1 glycerol. Cells were sub-
cultured using 1% (v/v) inoculum in 2 L shake flasks containing 500 ml
of the same supplemented LB broth at 37°C and 250 rpm. Transami-
nase expression was induced with 1 mM of isopropyl β-D-1-
thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, Calbiochem, San Diego, CA) when
growing in early exponential phase, and temperature was reduced
to 30°C. PLP was added to a final concentration of 400 µM at least
15 min before harvesting. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at
8,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C, 5 hr after induction.
For experiments performed at pH 9, the cells were grown in
Terrific Broth 46.7 g L
−1, induced at OD 0.3 with 0.1 mM IPTG and
shaken overnight at 200 rpm. No PLP was added before harvesting.
Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8,000 rpm for 20 min at 4°C.
Lysate preparation
The cell pellets were resuspended in either 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.0 or pH
9, according to the different pH experiments, and sonicated on ice
(Soniprep 150, MSE Sanyo, London, UK). The suspension was centrifuged
at 13,000 rpm at 4°C for 20 min and the supernatant removed from the cell
debris. The clarified cell lysates were stored at−20°C until use.
2.4 | Biotransformations
2.4.1 | Transketolase batch reactions
Reactions were performed in 10 ml vials filled with 7 ml of reaction
media and mixed by magnetic stirring. Substrate concentrations were
50 mM HPA and 50 mM GA in the vial, and TK concentrations ranged
from 0.63 to 2.85 U ml
−1. The concentrations of ThDP and MgCl2 were
2.4 and 9.8 mM for the lowest enzyme concentration. The cofactor
concentrations were increased by a factor 1.25 for each increase in
enzyme concentration, so that the cofactor concentrations were
9.395 mM ThDP and 38.28 mM MgCl
2 for the highest enzyme
concentration. All solutions were prepared in 50 mM Tris–HCl pH
7.0. Prior to reaction, TK was incubated with the cofactors for 30 min.
Aliquots of 50μl were taken at various time intervals and quenched
with 450μl 0.1% (v/v) aqueous TFA, centrifuged (5,000 rpm, 5 min)
and the supernatant analyzed by HPLC as described above.
2.4.2 | Transketolase flow reactions
Two syringes, one containing transketolase (TK ranging from 2.00 to
8.07 U ml
−1, with cofactors ThDP 4.8 mM and MgCl2 19.6 mM), the
other containing the substrate solutions (100 mM HPA and GA), were
connected to the microreactor. Both solutions were pumped (KDS210,
KD Scientific, Holliston, MA) at the same flow rate, which varied
between 1 and 60μl min
−1 (i.e., 2 and 120μl min−1 total flow rate in the
reaction channel), depending on the desired residence time. To ensure
the measurements were performed when the microreactor was in
steady state, samples were taken after three (mean) residence times.
Samples were quenched with 0.1% (v/v) TFA.
2.4.3 | Transaminase batch reactions
Reactions were performed in 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes containing
25 mM ERY, purchased from Sigma–Aldrich, UK, 10 mM MBA, 1 mM
PLP, and TAm in the range of 1.90 and 5.24 U ml
−1. Solutions were
thoroughly mixed with a pipette and allowed to react at room
temperature (20°C). Samples were removed at the required time
intervals, quenched with 0.1% (v/v) TFA, centrifuged (5,000 rpm,
5 min) and the supernatant analyzed by HPLC.
2.4.4 | Transketolase-transaminase cascade flow
reactions
A fluidic path was created by connecting the transketolase micro-
reactor, a micromixer and a transaminase coil reactor (PTFE coil, ID
0.75 mm and 6.43 m long), with Upchurch® connectors and fittings (P-
221, Upchurch Scientific). Syringe pumps (KDS210, KD Scientific,
Holliston) which were connected to the reactors at different points in
the fluidic path (Figure 1). Transketolase reactions were carried out
under identical conditions as previously described (section 2.6.2) with
an activity of 3.25 U ml
−1. For the transaminase reaction, one syringe
containing 40 mM MBA (pH 10, initial pH), and a second containing
27.0 U ml−1 TAm lysate and 2 mM and PLP respectively at pH 9, were
connected to the micromixer as shown in Figure 1 (final concentrations
of 10 mM MBA and 10.8 U ml
−1 TAm were thus obtained). The flow
rate for the TAm syringe was varied from 2 to 40μl min−1. All other
inlet flows were set at half the TAm flow rate. Samples were taken after
three (mean) residence times, quenched with 0.1% (v/v) TFA and
analyzed by HPLC as described above. To compare batch and
continuous reactions the residence times were normalized according
to Marques, Fernandes, Cabral,Žnidaršič-Plazl, and Plazl (2012).
3 | RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 | Reactors for the transketolase-transaminase
cascade
The transketolase (TK) reaction was performed in a microreactor
with a serpentine reaction channel (500 µm wide, 500 µm deep) and
a working volume of 240 µl. The TK enzyme and the two substrates
were brought together in the reaction channel with a T-junction
(Figure 2a). Downstream of the outlet of the TK microreactor, the
co-substrate for the transaminase reaction, and the transaminase
(TAm) were added to the product stream of the TK microreactor
using a micromixer. The device contained a Y-junction followed by a
meandering channel (500 µm wide, 450 µm deep, and internal
volume of 200 µl) to enhance the mixing (Figure 2b). At the point of
confluence of the Y-junction, the co-substrate was mixed with the
product from the TK reaction. The TAm was introduced in a second
inlet further downstream of the Y-junction to ensure that the co-
substrate of the TAm reaction had mixed with the product from the
TK reaction before the TAm enzyme was added. The devices were
connected as described in section 2.4.4 to form a microfluidic flow

path for the transketolase-transaminase reaction cascade using the
transaminase coil reactor to provide sufficiently long residence
times. The fluidic connector bars were fabricated according to
previously reported designs (Gruber, Marques, Sulzer et al., 2017;
Lawrence, O'Sullivan, Lye, Wohlgemuth, & Szita, 2013).
3.2 | Optimization of the transketolase reaction in
the microreactor
In a previous study of the production of L-erythrulose (ERY) from
hydroxypyruvate (HPA) and glycolaldehyde (GA), full conversion of
50 mM of HPA and GA was achieved in approximately 2 hr using
2.28 mg ml−1 of total lysate protein (O'Sullivan et al., 2012). In the
present work, transketolase concentrations were varied between 1.95
and 7.66 mg ml−1 (corresponding to 1–4Um l−1, respectively) while
substrate concentrations were maintained at 50 mM, in order to
explore the maximal volumetric productivity achievable with the
reactor. The time to achieve full conversion was expected to reduce as
the TK concentration increased. The conversion time would decrease
either until eventually a plateau would be reached where the enzyme is
in excess and the reaction becomes mass transfer limited; or where an
upper limit of the enzyme concentration would be reached, imposed by
the solubility of TK in the reaction medium.
The enzyme concentrations and the corresponding observed
reaction rates for this optimization study were summarized in
Table 1. A maximum initial rate of 1.19 × 10
−2 mmol ml−1 min−1 was

butanetriol (ABT). Hydroxypyruvate and glycolaldehyde were brought together in a serpentine microreactor with the transketolase (TK) lysate.
The product of the reaction, L-erythrulose, was fed into a micromixer where it was mixed with (S)-α-methylbenzyl-amine and the second
enzyme lysate, containing transaminase (TAm). The TAm reaction took place in a coil reactor where (2S,3R)-2-amino-1,3,4-butanetriol was
produced

achieved for a TK activity of 0.77 U per reactor volume; a higher
activity per reactor volume did not further increase the reaction rate.
Therefore, this set a practical upper limit to the enzyme concentra-
tion in the optimization studies, indicating that the maximum
volumetric productivity was attained. The complete reaction profiles
for the six conditions used are presented in Figure S1, Supporting
Information.
Full conversions were achieved for all conditions, but the
residence times required were significantly reduced by the increased
enzyme concentrations (Figure 3). For an increase in TK activity from
0.24 U to 0.77 U (and 0.97 U) the conversion time reduced from 45 min
to just 8 min. Thus we achieved a >5-fold decrease of the conversion
time between the conditions applied in this reactor, and a 15-fold
decrease compared to our previous results (O'Sullivan et al., 2012). The
quantification of ERY was performed using calibration curves derived
from standard solutions of purified ERY, which explained conversions
seemingly higher than 100%.
The experimental results obtained in the microreactor were
compared with reactions in magnetically stirred vessels for identical
substrate and enzyme concentrations. As in the case of the flow
reactions, the initial reaction rate increased with higher concentrations
of transketolase (data not shown).
3.3 | Optimization of the transaminase reaction
The transaminase-catalyzed reaction of ERY with MBA to (2S,3R)-2-
amino-1,3,4-butanetriol (ABT) and acetophenone (AP) has a much
lower reaction rate constant than the TK-catalyzed reaction of GA with
HPA to ERY and CO2. According to (Matosevic, Lye, & Baganz, 2011),
the initial rate of TK is fourfold higher than that of the initial rate of
TAm, thus more than three orders of magnitude lower than the
reported reaction rate for transketolase. To find the maximal
productivity, batch reactions using 25 mM ERY and 10 mM MBA
were performed with increasing concentrations of biocatalyst. The
excess of ERY, used throughout this present work, was chosen to
overcome the unfavorable reaction equilibrium (Villegas-Torres et al.,
2015); though we chose a much lower excess of ERY than previously
reported in order to avoid a large excess of ERY which would render
potential downstream purification steps more challenging. The
concentration of the amine donor (MBA) was fixed at 10 mM due to
the inhibitory effects on the enzyme for higher concentrations (Halim
et al., 2014). The highest transaminase concentration tested in batch
was 5.24 U ml
−1 (data not shown).
Increasing the transaminase concentration led to higher conver-
sion yields within shorter residence times (Figure 4). Full conversion
was achieved after 20 hr with the two highest TAm concentrations, 4.2
and 5.24 U ml−1. After 10 hr, with a TAm concentration of 5.24 U ml−1
the conversion was approximately 90%. Unlike in the transketolase
optimization study, for this enzyme, we did not observe a plateau of
initial reaction rate when comparing the reaction rates for enzyme
concentrations between 1.91 and 5.24 U ml
−1.
3.4 | Transketolase cofactor optimization for coupled
TK-TAm reaction
Initially, when we performed the TK-catalyzed and TAm-catalyzed
reactions in sequence, we did not detect any ABT or AP formation
(data not shown). As a result, we tested all compounds of the TK
reaction for any inhibitory effects on the transaminase, and we
discovered that the activity of transaminase was significantly affected
by the concentration of the thiamine pyrophosphate (ThDP) cofactor,
while the concentration of the magnesium chloride had no effect
(Figure 5). Indeed, the transaminase activity decreased by approxi-
mately 25% when adding 2.4 mM of ThDP (compared with 0 mM
ThDP). For higher concentrations of ThDP, the activity decreased only
marginally. We therefore tested a value of ThDP smaller than 2.4 mM
for the TK reaction and we found that the reaction proceeded at similar
rates (as found during the TK optimization study, section 3.2) with a
ThDP concentration of 1.2 mM. For this concentration of ThDP, which
was half the concentration used in the TK optimization study for the
smallest enzyme concentration (section 3.2), we still obtained
conversion times of approximately 10 min for the TK reaction.
3.5 | Transketolase-transaminase cascade reactions
Having optimized the co-factor concentrations, we then evaluated the
performance of the microfluidic reaction cascade (Figure 1). Based on
the results obtained in section 3.4, we chose to investigate the TAm
reaction with (mean) residence times between 30 min and 10 hr. For a
coil reactor with a volume of 3 ml, flow rates between 5 and
100 μl min
−1 were required. Higher flow rates would have required a
longer coil reactor to achieve sufficiently long residence times, and

lower flow rates would be less reliable to execute (for example, a flow
rate of 5μl min−1 for the TAm reaction step meant a flow rate of only
1 μl min−1 for the co-substrate MBA). As a result of this choice of flow
rates for the TAm reaction step, the TK reactions were therefore
performed with flow rates between 2 and 40 μl min−1, that is,
residence times between 120 and 6 min, respectively. Additionally,
we used the compartmentalization afforded by the two microfluidic
reactors to perform each reaction at a different individual pH. The
results of section 3.4 had shown that performing the TAm reaction
at pH 7 led to long reaction times. Therefore, the TK reaction was
performed at pH 7, and then the solution entering the coil reactor was
adjusted to a pH 9 for the TAm reaction step (Schell et al., 2009).
As can be seen from Figure 6, 10 mM of ABT were obtained after
2 hr both in the continuous microfluidic system and in the batch
system. Also, within the same time, we observed a full conversion of
MBA to AP. Achieving full conversion in 2 hr meant a 10-fold reduction
of the reaction time from the 20 hr in Figure 4. This dramatic
improvement in space-time yield was primarily due to the optimization
of the reaction conditions, such as the pH for the TAm reaction, a
higher activity of the enzyme and the reduced concentration of the co-
factors for the TK reaction. Furthermore, the ERY used in the batch
experiments (Figure 4) was from a different origin and produced by a
fermentation process. It was a hygroscopic solution with a water
content of 14.2% and showed small amounts of impurities (data not
shown). These impurities were not present in the ERY produced in situ
biocatalytically (with the TK), which shows the advantage of producing
an intermediate in a biocatalytic reaction sequence.
The ABT concentration obtained in our microfluidic reactor
cascade is comparable with or higher than other transaminase-
catalyzed reaction steps in flow systems. A final 5 mM ABT
concentration was achieved in a capillary packed bed reactor with
purified immobilized enzymes (1.1 ± 0.15 and 0.15 ± 0.006 mg ml
−1 of

duplicate (n = 2) and the resulting standard error was below 5% (not plotted)

TAm and TK used, respectively) (Abdul Halim et al., 2013). Using an
initial substrate concentration of 60 mM HPA and GA, and 6 mM MBA
(i.e., a 10:1 ratio of ERY:MBA), the final concentration of ABT (83%
conversion) was reached in 20 min. In contrast, in our system we only
required a 2:1 ratio, which significantly facilitates recovery of the final
compound. Matosevic et al. (2011) immobilized both the TK and TAm
onto AB-NTA derivatized microcapillaries in order to produce 0.3 mM
of ABT in 40 min using 10 mM MBA, HPA, and GA (i.e., an equimolar
ratio of ERY:MBA), though ABT was not directly measured. Full
conversion was not shown, but could be estimated to be achievable
after 45 hr, which is more than an order of magnitude larger than the
2 hr to full conversion reported here.
ABT has traditionally been produced in one-pot batch systems
using the TK-TAm enzymatic reactions, yet full conversion was not
demonstrated. Ingram et al. (2007) obtained a final concentration of
5 mM ABT (corresponding to a 21% mol/mol yield conversion of L-
erythrulose to ABT) over 100 hr of reaction time. However, the
corresponding conversion of MBA to AP and the depletion of ERY
were each clearly below 100%. More recently, Villegas-Torres et al.
(2015) showed a conversion limitation of ABT at 2.5 mM after 50 hr
using L-serine instead of MBA as a co-substrate for the TAm reaction.
Side reactions limited the attainable conversion, which illustrates a
disadvantage of one-pot systems: the difficulty of achieving optimal
reaction conditions for both enzymes. To successfully achieve full
conversion of the coupled TK-TAm reaction, it is mandatory to obtain
full conversion of the substrates of the first enzymatic step; GA and
HPA are preferable substrates for the reaction catalyzed by the
CV2025 transaminase. The transamination of HPA can for example
lead to the formation of serine (Rios-Solis et al., 2011; Villegas-Torres
et al., 2015). Full conversion in the TAm reaction step was achieved by
Halim et al. (2014). However, they used purified ERY instead of
forming this substrate with a coupled TK-catalyzed reaction step
upstream. And additionally, the TAm reaction step either required a
secondary reaction to shift the reaction equilibrium, or the implemen-
tation of in situ product removal strategies (ISPR).
A number of routes could be pursued to further improve ABT
production; by using purified enzyme the volumetric activity per unit
volume could be increased; by using time-controlled additions of MBA
using a microfluidic side-entry reactor (Gruber, Marques, Sulzer et al.,
2017; Lawrence et al., 2013) the space-time yield could be increased;
by adding optical sensors and control strategies to maintain optimal

pyrophosphate (ThDP) and MgCl2, on the transaminase activity.
Activity was determined through photometric detection of
acetophenone formation at 280 nm and given in mM
AP min−1. The
reactions were performed at 20°C with initial concentrations of
10 mM sodium pyruvate and 10 mM (S)-α-methylbenzylamine
(MBA). Experiments were performed in quadruplicates (n = 4) and
error bars represented ± 1 standard deviation about the mean
FIGURE 6 Reaction profiles for the coupled transketolase-transaminase reaction a sequentially added batch (left) and in a microfluidic
reaction cascade (right) for residence times up to 2 hr. The reactions were performed at 20°C with an initial concentration of 50 mM of GA
and HPA for the TK reaction, and with an initial substrate concentrations in flow of 20 mM L-erythrulose (ERY), 10 mM (S)-α-
methylbenzylamine (MBA) with transketolase and transaminase enzyme activity of 3.25 U ml
−1 and 10.8 U ml−1, respectively. The TK reaction
was performed at a starting pH of pH 7, while the TAm reaction was performed at pH 9. The TK reaction was not the rate-limiting step in the
cascade system and therefore neglected. Reactions were performed in triplicates (n = 3), error bars representing one standard deviation. To
compare batch and continuous reactions the residence times were normalized according to Marques et al. (2012)

reaction conditions (Gruber, Marques, Szita, & Mayr, 2017); by
increasing the ERY to MBA ratio the equilibrium could be shifted
further toward the product side (Scheme 1) (though at the expense of
recovery efforts); or finally by implementing ISPR strategies (Gruber,
Marques, O'Sullivan et al., 2017). For the latter, the use of a
chromatography or a liquid-liquid extraction unit operation could be
envisaged as an ISPR step. As an example of such a system (Figure 7), a
filtration step between the TK reactor and the micromixer could be
added to remove and recycle the TK. A similar filtration step could also
be added after the TAm coil reactor to recycle this enzyme. The
permeate from this filtration step could be fed into a liquid-liquid
extraction unit to facilitate recovery of the final compound. A fully
assembled synthesis and purification system as shown in Figure 7
could then become a first step toward an automated continuous-flow
production of ABT.
4 | CONCLUSIONS
Using continuous-flow microreactors, we have optimized the two-step
enzymatic synthesis of the chiral amino-triol (2S,3R)-2-amino-1,3,4-
butanetriol (ABT), an important building block for statins and
intermediate in the synthesis of detoxinine. Our results have shown
the use of cascading free enzymes in microfluidic devices for the first
time, with significant improvement in conversion yields over free
enzymes in one-pot systems (Ingram et al., 2007) and over immobilized
enzymes in microfluidic systems (Abdul Halim et al., 2013; Matosevic
et al., 2011) The transketolase (TK)-transaminase (TAm) reaction
cascade was optimized according to Gruber, Marques, O'Sullivan et al.
(2017) to overcome key issues, such as substrate and cofactor
inhibition, and we have obtained for the first time full conversion in
both continuous-flow microreactors and batch systems.
We have successfully reduced the conversion time of the first
reaction step, the hydroxypyruvate (HPA) and glycolaldehyde (GA)
conversion into L-erythrulose (ERY), from 2 hr (O'Sullivan et al., 2012)
to less than 10 min using a TK enzyme activity of 3.25 U ml
−1. When
coupled with the TAm reaction, using (S)-α-methylbenzylamine (MBA)
as a co-substrate and increasing the volumetric activity of the TAm up
to 10.8 U ml−1, a final yield of 100% ABT and a full conversion of MBA
in 2 hr was achieved. Furthermore, the spatial confinement of the two
enzymatic reactions enabled us to detect a previously unreported
inhibition effect of thiamine diphosphate (ThDP), the cofactor of TK
(the first enzyme in the cascade), on the rate of the second enzyme,
TAm. This discovery could in principle have been obtained with a
suitable configuration of (mini)batch reactors, though at the expense of
not arriving at a continuous synthesis of ABT.
The modular microfluidic system offers flexibility for further
engineering adaptations and improvements to increase the produc-
tivity of biocatalytic systems (Marques & Szita, 2017). These
improvements can either relate to reactor engineering, for example
by redesigning reactors to allow the additions of substrates at
different points in the reaction in order to avoid enzyme deactivation
due to substrate inhibition (Gruber, Marques, Sulzer et al., 2017;
Lawrence et al., 2013), or relate to process monitoring and control
strategies (Gruber, Marques, Szita et al., 2017), or relate to the
implementation of in situ product removal strategies to drive the
reaction equilibrium toward the formation of ABT (Gruber, Marques,
O'Sullivan et al., 2017; Halim et al., 2014).
Multi-step enzymatic syntheses are of increasing interest as
straightforward and sustainable routes from simple starting materials
to chiral amino-alcohols (Lorillière et al., 2017; Sehl, Maugeri, & Rother,
2015b; Villegas-Torres et al., 2015). This work has established modular
microfluidic devices as a versatile and powerful tool for biocatalytic
process optimization and intensification and as a platform for the
investigation of such cascade reactions using enzymes in their free
form without the need for immobilization.
