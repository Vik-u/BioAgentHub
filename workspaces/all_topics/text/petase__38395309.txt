Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is a major plastic poly-
mer utilized in the single-use and textile industries. The dis-
covery of PET-degrading enzymes (PETases) has led to an
increased interest in the biological recycling of PET in addition
to mechanical recycling.IsPETase fromIdeonella sakaiensis is
a candidate catalyst, but little is understood about its structure-
function relationships with regards to PET degradation. To
understand the effects of mutations onIsPETase productivity,
we develop a directed evolution assay to identify mutations
beneﬁcial to PET ﬁlm degradation at 30
/C14 C. IsPETase also
displays enzyme concentration-dependent inhibition effects,
and surface crowding has been proposed as a causal phenom-
enon. Based on total internal reﬂectance ﬂuorescence micro-
scopy and adsorption experiments, IsPETase is likely
experiencing crowded conditions on PET ﬁlms. Molecular
dynamics simulations ofIsPETase variants reveal a decrease in
active siteﬂexibility in free enzymes and reduced probability of
productive active site formation in substrate-bound enzymes
under crowding. Hence, we develop a surface crowding model
to analyze the biochemical effects of three hit mutations
(T116P, S238N, S290P) that enhanced ambient temperature
activity and/or thermostability. Weﬁnd that T116P decreases
susceptibility to crowding, resulting in higher PET degradation
product accumulation despite no change in intrinsic catalytic
rate. In conclusion, we show that a macromolecular crowding-
based biochemical model can be used to analyze the effects of
mutations on properties of PETases and that crowding
behavior is a major property to be targeted for enzyme engi-
neering for improved PET degradation.
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is a major plastic poly-
mer composed of terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol,
which are joined by ester linkages. Due to the presence of the
ester bonds in PET, it is more amenable to biodegradation and
has become the most studied synthetic polymer for enzymatic
depolymerization. Ideonella sakaiensis is a bacterium discov-
ered in 2016 that consumes PET as a carbon source (1). It
harbors the PET-degrading enzyme IsPETase, which is a
member of the cutinase family and one of the fastest known
enzymes for depolymerization of PET at room temperature (1).
The enzyme releases soluble PET degradation products such
as ethylene glycol, TPA, mono-2-hydroxyethyl terephthalate
(MHET), bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), and
potentially oligomers (2). Many rational engineering efforts
have been aimed at enhancingIsPETase thermostability and
high temperature activity, and many directed evolution
screening methods have been developed to identify variants
with prolonged activity and/or better activity at elevated
temperatures (3– 7). The thermostability ofIsPETase has thus
been improved drastically to be on par with known thermo-
stable PETases (also belonging mostly to the cutinase family)
(3– 5). However, little is known about the biochemical impact
of these mutations, other than improvements in stability and
increased product yield over a given period of time at higher
temperatures. Biochemical analyses of IsPETase kinetics are
particularly difﬁcult due to a lack of kinetic models that can
interpret the nonideal kinetic behaviors ofIsPETase and also
account for variables that stem from the solid nature of the
substrate. Thus, the effects of most of the activity mutations
that have been identiﬁed remain largely unknown.
Kinetic analysis is the standard method to study effects of
mutations on catalytic activity. The kinetic models tradition-
ally used for this purpose are the conventional Michaelis–
Menten (
convMM) model, in conditions of substrate-site
excess, and the inverse Michaelis– Menten (invMM) model, in
conditions of enzyme excess (8). However,IsPETase displays a
concentration-dependent inhibition behavior where increasing
enzyme concentrations eventually lead to decreased depoly-
merization rates of solid PET, particularly at its optimal re-
action pH of 9 (1, 2, 9, 10). This phenomenon, which herein
will be referred to as the inhibition effect, has also been
observed in cellulases and poly(hydroxyalkanoate) (PHA)

depolymerases, suggesting that it is a general behavior
observed in enzymatic degradation of solid substrates. The
inhibition effect makes it complicated to interpret biochemical
properties using the MM kinetic models, which assume ideal
saturation behaviors. To adapt the
invMM model toIsPETase,
studies haveﬁt exclusively the increasing portion of the kinetic
data with the invMM model (10). This approach cannot be
used to explain the inhibition behavior exhibited byIsPETase
nor predict the optimal enzyme concentration given a sub-
strate concentration. Furthermore, it is unknown whether the
ﬁtted parameters represent true biochemical properties of the
considered enzymes (11, 12).
The only known macroscopic kinetic model that captures
the inhibition effect was proposed by Mukaiet al. (1993) to
describe the kinetic pro ﬁles of poly(hydroxybutyrate) ﬁlm
degradation by PHA depolymerases (13). According to the
Mukai model, the degradation reaction requires the interac-
tion between the catalytic domain of a surface-bound enzyme
and an adjacent free substrate site, due to the multidomain
nature of PHA depolymerases. As a result, in systems
described by the Mukai model, the degradation rate eventually
decreases as the site coverage increases, and the degradation
reaction is completely halted at full site coverage. The model
proposed by Mukaiet al.for multidomain PHA depolymerases
cannot be directly applied to explain the inhibition effect of
single-domain depolymerases, such asIsPETase, which do not
require two adjacent binding sites to form an active complex
(9, 13). Furthermore, the model was incomplete in that it did
not take into account the effect of substrate concentration on
reaction rate (13). Finally, the model makes the assumption
that enzyme concentrations are in excess of substrate sites,
which is not always true for a given system.
The inhibition dynamics of the Mukai model can be loosely
interpreted as a form of macromolecular crowding, where an
enzyme requires enough physical space, in this case an adjacent
binding site, to perform catalysis. Similarly, the coarse-grained
simulation model developed by Ezakiet al. (2019) successfully
described the inhibition effect for cellulase by accounting for the
competition between the binding and catalytic domains for
space on the substrate surface (11). Though the Ezaki model
captures the inhibition effect, it requires as input single-
molecule experimental rate constants, and it is not intended
for ﬁtting macroscopic kinetic data. Crowding phenomena have
also been observed in protein adsorption experiments, where
increasing protein adsorption on a surface results in transition
(such as reorientation) to more compact states due to crowding
effects (14, 15). Interestingly, Avilanet al. (2023) reported that
the inhibition effect ofIsPETase can be modulated by increasing
the substrate surface area, which increases the enzyme con-
centration at which the inhibition effect is observed; the authors
proposed that these observations are likely due to a surface
crowding (SC) phenomenon (9).
More broadly, macromolecular crowding is a phenomenon
where increasing concentrations of macromolecules decrease
accessible volume and thus favor protein conformations that
best compact into the available space (16– 18). The phenom-
enon has been extensively investigated using molecular
dynamics and coarse-grained simulations, which have shown
that crowding causes larger reductions in enzyme activity for
enzymes with larger conformational changes during catalysis
(16, 18). Similarly, the intramolecular distances between resi-
dues of a mesophilic protein was reduced upon addition of
crowding agents, suggesting a more compact conformation,
whereas the thermophilic counterpart was invariant in the
presence of crowding agents (19). Macromolecular crowding
effects have been observed experimentally using inert crowd-
ing agents such as 100 g/L Ficoll 70 and 50 g/L bovine serum
albumin (BSA), which suggests that a separation distance of
/C24 10 nm between molecule centers results in crowding (20).
In this study, WTIsPETase and the previously developed
thermostable TS-PETase variant (S121E, D186H, N233C,
R280A, S282C) were evolved using random- and semi-
rational– directed evolution for improved activity at 30
/C14 Ct o
obtain a set of mutations for biochemical analysis (2, 7). To
investigate how and if the isolated mutations enhancedIsPE-
Tase catalytic activity, we develop a novel biochemical model
based on macromolecular crowding for depolymerases that
display inhibition effects. To support the SC hypothesis,
IsPETase density on the PET surface is probed with total in-
ternal reﬂectance ﬂuorescence microscopy and adsorption
experiments. Furthermore, molecular dynamics simulations
are performed to investigateIsPETase behavior under crowded
and uncrowded conditions. Finally, using the SC model, we
determine the catalytic rate and binding parameters of the
evolved variants to gain mechanistic insights into the effects of
the mutations on PET degradation and enzyme properties to
be targeted for engineering.
Results
Directed evolution ofIsPETase identiﬁes mutations that
enhance ambient temperature productivity and
thermostability
An in vitro– directed evolution screen was developed for the
evolution of PET-degrading enzymes on PETﬁlms. Variants of
IsPETase with a C-terminal His8-tagged were expressed in
Escherichia coli, lysed, and screened for activity on BHET-agar
plates. All wells displaying activity were semi-puriﬁed using
Ni-NTA resin, yielding sufﬁciently pure protein that can be
quantiﬁed using MicroBCA and normalized to 100 nM for the
ﬁnal PET ﬁlm activity assay (A260/A280 ratios of elutions sug-
gested nucleic acid contamination but had minimal impact on
A
260 readings after normalization) (Fig. S1B). The reaction
supernatants are then transferred to a UV-transparent 384-
well plate and product levels are measured in a plate reader
using A260 (Fig. 1A). The activity assay allows all abiotic con-
ditions such as buffer composition, pH, temperature, and
substrate type to be varied (see detailed methods in SI).
Using the described directed evolution assay, two random
libraries and onein silico library were screened (total of 5400
variants). The selection conditions were 30
/C14 C and 50 mM
glycine-NaOH pH 9, 50 mM NaCl, and 10% v/v DMSO
(herein referred to as reaction buffer) with 0.25"-diameter
amorphous PET ﬁlms as substrate (Goodfellow). WT

IsPETase (WT) served as the template for theﬁrst random
mutagenesis library, and several hit mutations were identiﬁed
for known residues of interest such as R280S/H, Q119H, and
N246D; these ultimately did not pass validation screens
(Fig. S2, A and B)( 7, 21, 22). A novel mutation, T116P, was
found to increase PET degradation product accumulation and
the amount of eluted protein in the validation screens (Fig. 1,
B and C). Interestingly, this mutation had been previously
considered in computational design and was not selected (5).
T116P also increased the amount of eluted protein in vali-
dation screens when introduced into the thermostable variant
TS-PETase (Fig. 1, B and C). The T116P mutation did not
impact PET degradation in the TS-PETase background based
on the screens, but kinetic assays of >99% puriﬁed TS-
T116P-PETase (TSP-PETase) revealed a 30% improvement
in maximum product accumulation rate compared to puriﬁed
TS-PETase on 0.25”-diameter PET ﬁlms at 30
/C14 C( Figs. 1, C
and D; S2C and S3). TSP-PETase was used as the template for
the second round of random directed evolution, and S238N
was shown to further increase eluted protein in the screens
and potentially enhanced activity (Fig. 1, B and C). Many
mutations have been identi ﬁed at the S238 position with
varying effects on product accumulation, substrate speciﬁcity,
and thermostability (23– 26). Puriﬁed TSP-S238N-PETase had
a cumulative 1.5
/C14 C increase in thermostability compared to
TS-PETase, though inclusion of S238N resulted in a small

reduction in maximum productivity compared to TSP-PETase
(Figs. 1D and S2C).
An in silicolibrary consisting of 95 TS-PETase variants was
also selected with the overarching objective of enhancing
enzyme activity and thermostability ( Fig. S2 D). Mutation
S290P was found to increase elution yield in screens with no
effects on product accumulation (Fig. 1, B and C). This mu-
tation has also been recently identiﬁed by Shi et al. (2023),
further validating the screen (22). S290P was introduced into
TSP-S238N-PETase (TSP-S238N-S290P-PETase or TSPNP-
PETase) and puriﬁed enzyme displayed another 1.5
/C14 C in-
crease in thermostability relative to TSP-S238N-PETase with
slight reduction in maximum productivity on 0.25”-diameter
PET ﬁlms (Figs. 1D and S3); the mutation was carried forward
for further study due to the beneﬁts to thermostability and
puriﬁcation. The locations of the three identiﬁed mutations are
shown on the crystal structure ofIsPETase in Figure 1E (24).
To determine the kinetic impacts of the isolated mutations, the
inhibition effect was further investigated to develop a
comprehensive biochemical model for mutation analysis.
IsPETase likely experienced crowded conditions on the surface
of PET
Surface crowding has been previously proposed as the cause
of the inhibition effect, where crowded environments led to
decreased enzyme activity similar to effects of macromolecular
crowding (9, 11, 17). To explore enzyme density on PETﬁlms
during catalysis, puriﬁed IsPETase variants were incubated
with 0.25”-diameter PET ﬁlms for 1.5 h at 30
/C14 C and the
concentration of residual IsPETase in solution was used to
infer adsorption (Fig. S4, A– D)( 8). Intrinsic protein ﬂuores-
cence allowed detection down to 10 nM of enzyme, but
degradation products were found to artiﬁcially reduce ﬂuo-
rescence signal (Fig. S4, E– G). Thus, sample measurements
were corrected according to its estimated MHET concentra-
tion, which is the major product (Fig. S4H). To avoid product
interference and cross-validate the MHET-corrected mea-
surements, twoﬂuorescently-tagged (Atto647N and SulfoCy5)
TSP-PETase variants and inactive TSP-S160A-PETase were
also assayed. However, the addition ofﬂuorescent tags may
alter adsorption behavior, and the inactive variant cannot
productively bind PET and may have reduced adsorption.
With these caveats, average adsorption levels between 4 to 11
pmol at 40 nM of total enzyme and 5 to 16 pmol at 80 nM of
total enzyme were measured for all variants ( Fig. 2 A).
Considering 4 pmol of adsorbed enzyme on a completely
smooth PET surface, it equated to 5 nm separation distance
between evenly distributed particle centers or 2.5 nm mean
minimum distance between randomly distributed particle
centers based on Monte Carlo simulations. However, the
surface of PET is not completely smooth on the nanometer
scale, and therefore the separation distances between mole-
cules were likely larger (27). Intermolecular interactions be-
tween enzymes as well as varying PET substrate accessibility
across the surface can cause nonrandom distribution of mol-
ecules, which will also affect separation distance.
The enzyme density and distribution on the surface of PET
were further explored using total internal reﬂection ﬂuores-
cence microscopy (TIRF) with TSP-Atto647N. Though TSP-
Atto647N showed the lowest adsorption in solution deple-
tion experiments, Atto647N was chosen due to higher

resistance to photobleaching and to obtain a lower-bound
density estimate (molecules within 214 nm also could not be
distinguished) (28). TSP-Atto647N (/C24 98% tagged) at concen-
trations of 0 to 500 pM were added to a PET-coated glass slide
([PET] = 5000 cm
2/L) and imaged under a TIRF microscope
(Fig. S5). Individual molecules were indistinguishable by 500
pM, while the mean minimum separation distance between
enzyme centers was measured to be 400 nm at 200 pM
(Figs. 2B and S5B). The distribution of enzyme particles on the
spun-coated PET surface appeared to be random across all
enzyme concentrations assayed ( Fig. S5 B). The onset of
observable inhibition effects is reported to occur around 80 to
120 nM of totalIsPETase with 630 cm
2/L PETﬁlms, which is
delayed to higher enzyme concentrations with increasing
substrate concentrations (2, 9). If a linear increase in surface
density (consistent with adsorption proﬁle in Fig. S4C) was
assumed to estimate separation distance at 75 nM enzyme and
5000 cm
2/L PET, the simulated mean minimum separation
distance of randomly distributed particle centers was found to
be /C24 20 nm (Fig. S6). Compared to a separation distance of
10 nm for crowding conditions induced by BSA and Ficoll 70
solutions in literature, the solution depletion and TIRF ex-
periments together supported thatIsPETase was likely expe-
riencing crowded surface conditions over the enzyme-
substrate concentration combinations where inhibition ef-
fects were observed. Finally, the adsorption experiments sug-
gested that the amount of free enzyme in the reaction was
<90% of the total enzyme concentration and enzyme excess
cannot be assumed in kinetic analyses at the lower enzyme
concentrations.
Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that crowding
reduces frequency of productive catalytic site conformations
To gain insights into macromolecular crowding effects on
enzyme conformation and activity, we performed all-atom MD
simulations of both free and PET-pentamer– bound WT and
TS-PETase. The simulations were performed at an enzyme
crowding concentration of 2 mM in solution (/C24 10 nm sepa-
ration distance) to be representative of higher enzyme con-
centrations expected on a crowded PET surface. We compared
our results against respective control simulations of a single
uncrowded IsPETase variant in both the free and pentamer-
bound state (Fig. 3, A– C). All MD analyses were performed
over the last 50 ns of the converged simulation trajectory for
both crowding and control simulations, at which time we
observed that each system had achieved equilibrium. This was
indicated by convergence of the RMSD in enzyme conforma-
tion and by complete monomer aggregation in crowding
simulations. For uncrowded control simulations, results and
error bars were reported as averages across three independent
replica MD simulations. For crowding simulations, results and
error bars were reported as averages across each of the eight
enzymes in the simulation. The simulations demonstrated that
crowding led to reduced overall enzymeﬂexibility and active
site residue ﬂexibility in free enzymes, while hindering the
formation of productive conformations in substrate-bound
enzymes (Fig. 3, D and F).
Under crowding conditions, it was observed that both WT
and TS-PETase underwent aggregation through nonspeciﬁc
attractive interactions, rendering them less mobile (Fig. 3C).
Thus, the averageﬂexibility of all eight enzymes in the system
was reduced when compared to that of a single enzyme from
the control simulation, which can be attributed to enhanced
protein– protein surface interactions stabilizing enzyme con-
formations. The formation of protein-protein interfaces was
stochastically driven and not related to speciﬁc residue in-
teractions. An increase in the overall stability of individual
enzymes can also be rationalized alongside inhibition behavior
and longer enzyme life-times under the crowding hypothesis.
The IsPETase active site is composed of the S160, D206, and
H237 catalytic triad, which is responsible for the hydrolysis of
the ester linkages in PET. No signiﬁcant change to the overall
active site ﬂexibility based on active site residue backbone
RMSD was observed between control and crowding conditions
for both WT (0.41 Åversus 0.52 Å) and TS (0.39 Åversus
0.33 Å) variants (Figs. 3D and S7C). To more comprehensively
capture active site dynamics in the free enzyme, theﬂexibility
of each catalytic triad residue was quantiﬁed using RMSF. The
average RMSF of the three active site residues and their in-
dividual side chains across all free enzyme MD systems were
drastically reduced under crowding conditions for both vari-
ants (Fig. 3,
D and E). Notably, the changes in RMSF from
control to crowding simulations of the isolated catalytic triad
side chains were larger than for the entire residues (Figs. 3E
and S7D), indicating that side chain mobility was the primary
contributor to overall active siteﬂexibility in the free enzymes.
The importance of side chain dynamics was further explored
in simulations of substrate-boundIsPETase variants.
We examined the effect of crowding on the frequency of
productive active site formation in substrate-bound enzyme
systems. Upon substrate binding, the catalytic triad residues
were responsible for forming productive active site conforma-
tions through hydrogen bond coupling between S160-H237 and
D206-H237 (29). Hydrogen bonding of S160 OH with Ne2-H of
H237 can be coupled to H237 Nδ1-H with either Oδ1o rOδ2o f
D206 (Fig. 3A), promoting D206-H237 charge stabilization and
S160 deprotonation to carry out nucleophilic attacks against
PET ester linkages for hydrolysis (Fig. 3B)( 30). Thus, the
probability of productive active site formation was quantiﬁed
based on the frequency of simultaneous coupling of both
hydrogen bond types in our MD simulations (3.5 Å donor-
acceptor distance and 30
/C14 angle cutoffs). Under crowding
conditions, we found that the probabilities of the substrate-
bound enzyme in forming productive active sites were greatly
reduced for both WT (60.2% to 15.0%) and TS-PETase (39.1% to
26.3%) (Figs. 3F and S7, E– G). Additionally, considerably lower
probabilities of productive conformations were observed for
uncrowded free enzyme compared to uncrowded substrate-
bound enzyme for WT (18.7%versus 60.2%) and TS-PETase
(22.2% versus 39.1%), while similar comparisons under crowd-
ing conditions indicated no signiﬁcant differences between free
and substrate-bound enzymes (Fig. 3, D and F).

Analysis of IsPETase kinetics using a surface crowding model
6 J. Biol. Chem. (2024) 300(3) 105783

To experimentally evaluate the MD simulation results,
crowding conditions were simulated in vitro with 100 to
400 mg/ml of Ficoll 70, and the rate of hydrolysis of BHET into
MHET by 40 nM of WT and TS-PETase were assayed. Ficoll
70 is a polar sugar polymer that has been shown to minimally
interact with proteins and often adopts a spherical shape of
approximately 5 nm in diameter, which is similar in size to
IsPETase (20, 31). WT and TS-PETase activity was unchanged
up to 200 mg/ml Ficoll 70, which suggested that the enzyme
was not inhibited by Ficoll 70 through protein– polymer in-
teractions (Fig. 3G). Both variants displayed similar decrease in
activity between 200 to 400 mg/ml Ficoll 70 (Fig. 3G). The
decreased BHET conversion observed in Ficoll 70 crowding
experiments agree with the MD simulations, both suggesting
that crowding will lead to decreased activity ofIsPETase.
An SC model for the analysis ofIsPETase activity
Based on the adsorption data and molecular dynamics
simulations, we propose a catalytic model that describes,
through macromolecular crowding, the inhibition effect
registered at highIsPETase concentrations. Since adsorption is
likely much faster than catalysis, which is consistent with
surface dynamics studies of PHL7 and LCC PETases, the two
steps were modeled here as separate subsequent processes
(32). Free enzymes E adsorb onto free substrate sitesN and
form adsorbed enzymesEN:
E þ N
!
ka
kd
EN (1)
where ka is the adsorption kinetic constant and kd is the
desorption kinetic constant.
The total concentration in the system of enzymeET and of
substrate sites NT are, respectively, given by:
½ET /C138¼½ E/C138þ½ EN/C138 (2)
½NT /C138¼½ N/C138þ½ EN/C138 : (3)
Since NT cannot be directly measured, we introduced the
parameter Γ, representing the number of sites per unit surface
of the substrate:
½NT /C138 ¼ Γ½N0/C138 (4)
where N0 is the substrate surface concentration in the system
(8). The parameter Γ depends on the enzyme variant and
substrate type, as different mutants will have different
abilities to access the substrate sites on the surface and
different substrates types have different substrate sites ( 8).
For example, PET chains are preferentially arranged in
gauche conformation on the surface of amorphous
Goodfellow PET ﬁlms at 30
/C14 C and very few are in trans
conformation, but a mutation to IsPETase will cause the
active site to prefer trans conformation chains, thus
decreasing the number of available substrate sites (lowered
Γ) on that PET substrate (30, 33). Under the assumption that
adsorption is much faster than catalysis, a quasi-steady-state
assumption was postulated forEN (32):

Adsorbed enzymesEN are present on the substrate surface
in either an uncrowded con ﬁguration ENuc, performing
catalysis with kinetic constantkcat,uc or in a crowded conﬁg-
uration ENc, with lower catalytic rate constantkcat,c:

½EN/C138¼½ ENuc/C138þ½ ENc/C138 (9)
where Cn is a polymer (ex: PET) chain of lengthn, Cn−1 is a
polymer chain of lengthn– 1, and P is a soluble degradation
product. In practice, the adsorbed enzymes would have a
distribution of catalytic kinetic constants based on the local
crowding conditions. However, since it was not possible to
measure the distribution of the catalytic rate across the
adsorbed enzyme population, we here lumped all enzymes that
were affected by crowding intoEN
c, which performed catalysis
with kinetic constant kcat,c. The Supplementary Information
further discusses this approximation.
From Eqs. 7 and 8, the overall polymer degradation rate is
d½P/C138
dt ¼ kcat;uc½ENuc/C138þ kcat;c½ENc/C138 : (10)
Assuming that the transition from uncrowded to crowded
conﬁgurations (and vice versa) is much faster than catalysis, an
equilibrium is quickly established betweenENuc and ENc:

where kc (kuc) is the kinetic constant for the transition from
uncrowded (crowded) to crowded (uncrowded) conﬁguration
and rc (ruc) is the rate of transition from uncrowded

(crowded) to crowded (uncrowded) enzyme con ﬁguration.
The crowding and uncrowding reactions reported in Eq.11
summarize a set of reactions that can lead to the transition
from an uncrowded to a crowded con ﬁguration (and vice
versa), as detailed in the Supplementary Information. Rates
r
c and ruc were computed, respectively, as (derivation in the

rc ¼ kc½EN uc/C138½ EN/C138 (13)
ruc ¼ kuc½ENc/C138ð½ NT /C138 −½EN/C138Þ (14)
Solving the system of Eqs.9, 12 to 14 for [ENc] and [ENuc]:
½ENuc/C138¼½ EN/C138 1 − θ
Kcθ þ 1−θ (15)
½ENc/C138¼½ EN/C138 Kcθ
Kcθ þ 1 − θ (16)
where Kc = kc/kuc is the crowding equilibrium parameter, and
the site coverageθ is
θ ¼ ½EN/C138
½NT /C138 ¼ ½EN/C138
Γ½N0/C138 : (17)
The polymer degradation rate (Equation10) becomes
d½P/C138

1− θ þ cKcθ
Kc θ þ 1 − θ ½EN/C138 (18)
where c = kcat,c/kcat,uc represents the ratio between the catalytic
rate constants of crowded and uncrowded enzyme conﬁgura-
tions. Equation 18 can be reformulated as
d½P/C138
dt ¼ kapp½EN/C138 (19)
where the apparent catalytic kinetic constantkapp represents
the average catalytic rate per adsorbed enzyme (i.e. produc-
tivity), which varies as a function ofθ due to crowding ac-
cording to
kapp ¼ kcat;uc
1−θ þ cKcθ
Kcθ þ 1−θ : (20)
In the extreme scenarios ofθ = {0, 1},kapp becomes:
kapp ¼
/C26kcat;uc; for θ ¼ 0;
kcat;c; for θ ¼ 1; (21)
showing thatkcat,uc represents the maximum catalytic rate per
adsorbed enzyme, corresponding to a site coverageθ = 0, while
kcat,c represents the minimum catalytic rate per enzyme, which
is achieved atθ = 1 where the detrimental effect of crowding
on the catalytic rate per enzyme reaches its maximum. Equa-
tion 20 clariﬁes the physical meaning ofK
c, which represents
how quickly the decay of the catalytic rate per enzyme from
kcat,uc to kcat,c occurs with increasing site coverageθ due to
crowding.
The biochemical model of Equations6, 17 and 18, together
with the ﬁtting parameters Ka, Kc, Γ, kcat,uc, and kcat,c repre-
sents a closed form solution that, given the inputsET and N0,
can predict the catalytic rate for a given mutant. We herein
refer to this model as the SC model.
Kinetic analysis of variants with the SC model
We next used the SC model established by Equations6,
17 and 18 to study the adsorption and catalytic behaviors of
WT, TS-PETase, and the two evolved TS-PETase variants
(TSP and TSPNP). The details of the parameter estimation
approach are provided in theExperimental Methods section.
Herein, we will refer to catalytic rate as the rate per enzyme
molecule, while productivity is used to refer to the observed
macroscopic product formation rate. The kinetic model
appropriately captured the steady-state productivity of the
IsPETases over a range of enzyme (10– 600 nM) and PET
(200– 1900 cm
2/L) loadings (Fig. 4) as measured using the
bulk absorbance method (the relative rates were validated
with HPLC upon reaction completion) (Figs. S8 and S9)( 2).
Notably all four IsPETases displayed crowding behavior at
30
/C14 C. At low enzyme concentrations, productivity increased
with increasing enzyme loading as more enzymes bound to
PET. However, as the enzyme loading increased further,
productivity slowed as the enzymes became crowded on the
PET surface. The kinetic model also captured the steady-
state adsorbed PETase concentrations (Equation 6), which
began to plateau at higher enzyme loadings (Fig. S10). The
estimated parameter values at 30
/C14 C are summarized in
Table 1.
TSP- and TSPNP-PETase achieved the highest produc-
tivity, followed by TS-PETase and WT, on both a total
enzyme loading ( Fig. 4) and predicted adsorbed enzyme
basis ( Fig. 5 , A and B). All TS-PETase – based variants
demonstrated higher catalytic rates in uncrowded condi-
tions k
cat,uc and a larger Γ than the WT enzyme, which
contributed to their higher productivity ( Table 1). Inter-
estingly, TS-PETase had lower productivity than the TSP
and TSPNP mutants despite having comparable k
cat,uc and
al a r g e rΓ (Table 1 ). This phenomenon suggested that
introduction of T116P decreased TS-PETase susceptibility
to crowding at 30
/C14 C, in both kinetics of transition to
crowded con ﬁgurations and kcat,c (TSP-PETase presented
smaller Kc and larger kcat,c , respectively) ( Table 1 ). The
S238N and S290P mutations had minimal impact on all
kinetic parameters, thus their main contribution is to the
thermostability of the enzyme. The model predictions of
the speci ﬁc catalytic rate per enzyme as a function of
bound enzyme (Fig. 5B) and the concentration of enzymes
in crowded con ﬁgurations with respect to site coverage
(Fig. 5 C) further supported that adsorbed WT and TS-
PETase were the least and the most affected by crowd-
ing, respectively. This was mainly due to WT having the

lowest Γ and TS-PETase having the highest Γ based on
model ﬁts to adsorption data, which dictated the extent of
SC conditions experienced by each variant ( Table 1 ,
Fig. S10).
To further characterize the changes in the kinetic parame-
ters and the associated mutations that could improve enzyme
productivity, we computed s

the 30 /C14 C conditions, TSP- and T SPNP-PETase achieved
higher productivity than TS-PETase. That said, the overall
productivity for all conditions and enzymes increased by
roughly an order of magnitude compared to 30
/C14 C( Fig. 4),
driven by a combination of more enzyme binding sites (Γ)
and faster uncrowded and crowded catalytic rate constants
(kcat,uc , kcat,c ; Table 2). In contrast to 30 /C14 C, however, no
enzymes displayed the characteristic inhibition effect
attributable to enzyme crowding. As a result, TSP-PETase

Discussion
Macromolecular crowding is a known phenomenon that
impacts protein dynamics in many ways from protein stability
and conformation to catalytic activity (16, 35). The effects of
crowding vary dramatically between crowding agents and the
biochemistry of the protein itself. Here, we propose a model
where a dilute enzyme solution phase can result in a crowded
surface environment upon protein adsorption, leading to
macromolecular crowding that can affect enzyme activity.
Based on our MD simulations, one possible explanation is that

sufﬁcient space for the necessary active site conformational
changes during hydrolysis is required for optimal enzyme
performance, which is consistent with reduced catalytic efﬁ-
ciency under crowding. For free enzymes, active siteﬂexibility
would allow easier transition to conformations that can readily
bind to the substrate (36). Interestingly, active siteﬂexibility
was inherently reduced upon substrate binding, resulting in
minimal differences in active siteﬂexibility between crowded
and uncrowded states (Fig. 3F). However, the frequency of
productive conformations sampled by substrate-bound en-
zymes was greatly reduced under crowding. Per residue side
chain RMSF differences (Fig. 3E) and atomic separation dis-
tance shifts between S160 OH and H237 N e2-H groups
(Fig. S7 E) suggested that S160 mobility drove hydrogen
bonding between S160 and H237 and limited productive site
formation (Fig. S7, F and G). Thus, we can attribute the
decreased frequency of productive enzyme con ﬁgurations
under crowding to sterically induced stabilization of unfavor-
able S160 positions. Notably, substrate-bound enzymes
sampled more productive active site conﬁgurations compared
to free enzymes, suggesting that substrate binding to the active
site itself had an effect in stabilizing favorable S160 positions.
The overall stability of substrate-bound enzyme was also
affected by macromolecular crowding as evident from the
reduced protein backbone RMSD (Fig. 3F). It was previously
observed that increased enzyme concentrations led to
decreased productivity, but the enzyme concentrations dis-
playing inhibition behavior also sustained the reaction over
longer periods of time (2). This observation is consistent with
the crowding hypothesis, which can result in more compact
conformations of IsPETase that may have led to increased
enzyme stability, resulting in longer life times ofIsPETase at
higher concentrations.
Using enzyme crowding as the basis for the inhibition effect,
we developed a two-state kinetic model of enzymatic catalysis
of solid PET, which is referred to as the SC model. The model
captured the expected shift in optimal enzyme concentration
with increasing substrate concentration as previously observed
by Avilan et al. (2023) (Fig. 4)( 9). Prior knowledge of a vari-
ant’s adsorption to PET is required to estimate an upper bound
for Γ and ﬁt K
a. Direct measurement of substrate site density
would result in an even more robust analysis, but it is
extremely difﬁcult to determine and cannot be reliablyﬁtted
using
invMM andconvMM as previously done for other systems
due to the inhibition effect (8). Therefore, the adsorption ca-
pacity was used as the upper bound forﬁtting the number of
substrate sites for each variant and the distinction between
adsorption (Γads) and substrate site density ( Γkin) was not
made. However, an enzyme may be able to adsorb to
nonspeciﬁc sites, resulting in higher adsorption capacity than
substrate site density, which may obscure analysis if the pro-
portions are very different between variants for relative com-
parisons (8, 37).
Interestingly, the current SC model Equation 20 reduces
down to the Mukai 1993 rate equation ifK
c =1 ,kcat,c = 0, along
with the inclusion of a substrate term, which shows that the
models are related ( 13). The SC model is a more
comprehensive model that removes several assumptions made
in the Mukai model, such as enzyme excess, zero activity at full
site coverage (likely true for two-domain but not necessarily
for single-domain depolymerases), and that mutations had no
effect on enzyme susceptibility to crowding (13). Thus, the
proposed SC model provides more detailed insights into ef-
fects of mutations and is likely more broadly applicable to all
solid-substrate depolymerases. Formally assessing the SC
model’s applicability to multidomain enzymes would require
collecting analogous datasets to those presented inFigures 4
and 6 and can be the focus of a future study.
The SC model showed that the true catalytic capacity will
never be experimentally observed in macroscopic experiments
due to crowding, which may also explain the discrepancy be-
tween single-molecule (uncrowded) and macroscopic rate
measurements for cellulases (11). Furthermore, it suggested
that ﬁtting with MM models will underestimate intrinsic cat-
alytic rate (
convMM, invMM, and general MMﬁts of increasing
portion of data can be found inFigs. S15 and S16, Tables S4
and S5). The SC model also revealed that WTkcat,c was the
least impacted by crowding, partly due to its lowered
adsorption capacity compared to the TS variants (fewer en-
zymes on the surface to induce similar levels of crowded
conformations) (Fig. 5, B and C). This result could appear
counter intuitive to observations from kinetic data where WT
displayed a 28% productivity inhibition at 400 nM total
enzyme while TS-PETase only had 12% inhibition at 400 nM,
highlighting the importance of coupling adsorption equilib-
rium experiments to kinetic analysis for complete data inter-
pretation. Adsorption experiments showed that WT
approached full site coverage faster due to its lowΓ and high
K
a; thus the model predicted a more pronounced macroscopic
effect of crowding as loss of uncrowded complexes were not
compensated by an increase in total adsorbed enzyme, while
the opposite was predicted for TS-PETase (Fig. 7). Therefore,
at a given enzyme loading, WT productivity was the most
sensitive to crowding at a macroscopic scale, despite individual
enzymes maintaining the highest catalytic activity in crowded
conﬁgurations. On the contrary, TS-PETase productivity was
most resistant to crowding, as the high crowding effects were
compensated with a higher adsorption capacity (Fig. 5C).
The SC model predicts that the most desirable mutations for
improving enzymatic PET degradation will (i) increaseΓ and (ii)
the k
cat,uc, while (iii) decreasingKc. This is consistent with re-
ports where fusion of a polymer-binding module to PET-
hydrolases increased enzyme productivity (increased Γ)
(38– 43). However, it was also found that a few hydrophobic
modules, which greatly increased the productivity of some
thermostable PET-hydrolases, sometimes resulted in lowered
IsPETase productivity (38, 41, 42). This could be due to a large
increase inΓ that resulted in a large population of crowded WT-
fusion enzymes, which led to lower productivity due to sus-
ceptibility of the WT-fusion to crowding effects (reducedk
cat,c
and likely increasedKc). On the contrary, inhibition effects are
less commonly observed in thermostable PET-hydrolases,
suggesting that increasing their binding capacity is more likely
to lead to an increase in observed productivity (9).
Analysis of IsPETase kinetics using a surface crowding model
12 J. Biol. Chem. (2024) 300(3) 105783

In conclusion, we present a kinetic model based on the
hypothesis of macromolecular crowding on the solid substrate
surface during enzymatic depolymerization. The phenomenon
is applicable to many ambient-temperature solid-substrate
depolymerases and may also be relevant for high-temperature
reactions, which are very important for future bio-economies
such as biorecycling and biovalorization of food wastes
(9, 11, 13). The implications of the model will likely have large
impacts on enzyme engineering for improved yields, as
decreasing crowding tendency alone can boost productivity of
the enzymes. Analysis of kinetic data using the model will
allow identiﬁcation of the types of mutations that provide
resistance to crowding, which can then be probed using pro-
tein dynamics methods such as NMR to better understand the
structure-function relationships of crowding behavior. Finally,
fundamental knowledge of structure-crowding relationships
will allow predictions of beneﬁcial mutations and improve the
efﬁciency of a large number of critical bioprocesses.
Experimental methods
Cloning and plasmid constructs
All plasmids used in this study were generated using the
pET21a+ backbone (2). Brieﬂy, IsPETase (residues 28– 290) was
codon optimized for expression in E. coli and cloned into
pET21a+ with a C-terminal His-tag using PCR with Phusion
polymerase (New England BioLabs) and primers listed in
Table S6. The PCR fragments were joined together using NEB-
uilder HiFi DNA Assembly Mix (New England BioLabs). All
constructs contained a His
6-tag except for plasmids used for
directed evolution, which had a C-terminal His8-tag. The C-ter-
minal His8-tag was introduced into the pET21a- IsPETase
plasmid using pET21a His8 F/R primers. Plasmids were propa-
gated using E. coli TOP10F0 (New England BioLabs) in
LB+100 μg/ml carbenicillen medium (herein referred to as
LB+Carb). Site-directed mutagenesis was performed as previ-
ously described to introduce T116P, S238N, and S290P into the
TS-PETase background (Table S6)( 2). The LPETGG Sortase
recognition tag was introduced in front of the C-terminal His
6-tag
for Sortase-tagging ofﬂuorescent peptides onto the C-terminus
of TSP-PETase (primers: pET21a Srt F andIsPETase Srt R,
Table S6).
Cloning of directed evolution libraries
In silicomutant libraries of TS-PETase were synthesized by
Twist Biosciences and cloned into the pET21a+ plasmid.
Round one– directed evolution library was generated using
WT IsPETase as template and the following PCR conditions
for aﬁnal reaction of 50μl: 2μl of 10 mM dGTP/dATP, 10μl
of 10 mM dCTP/dTTP, 10 μl 55 mM MgCl
2,5 μl1m M
MnCl2,3 μlo f1 0 μM IsPETase mut F/R, 2 fmol template
DNA, 1μl GoTaq Polymerase, and 33.6μl water (44). The PCR
was ampliﬁed 20 cycles. Round two– directed evolution library
was generated using TSP-PETase as template and the
following PCR conditions: 5 μl 10× GeneMorph II buffer,
100 ng template DNA, 2.5 ng/μl IsPETase mut F/R, 1μlo f
40 mM dNTP, 1μl GeneMorph II polymerase (Agilent), and
37.5 μl water. The PCR was ampliﬁed 23 cycles to aim for 0 to
4.5 mutations/fragment. The pET21a+His
8 backbone was
ampliﬁed with Phusion polymerase and pET21a F/R. The PCR
products were DpnI-digested for 6 h at 37/C14 C and gel puriﬁed
(Zymo DNA Gel Puriﬁcation Kit). Ligation was performed
using NEBuilder HiFi DNA assembly mix at a 1:1 M ratio of
insert to backbone (New England BioLabs) at 50
/C14 C for 6 h. All
primer sequences are listed inTable S6.
In silico–directed evolution
A disulﬁde bridge at N233C-S282C was introduced into the
crystal structure ofIsPETaseS121E/D186H/R280A (PDB: 6IJ6) (7).
The ﬁnal structure was minimized to account for the effect of
the additional mutations and protonated accordingly at pH 9
using Yasara software (http://www.yasara.org) and H++ web-
server (http://newbiophysics.cs.vt.edu/H++/) to generate the
TS-PETase structure for in silico evolution (45, 46). Several
computational methodologies were employed to computa-
tionally evolve TS-PETase, each targeting distinct parts of the
enzyme’s structure, namely distal positions and the active site
(see Supplementary Information for detailed methods).

overnight starter was inoculated 1:100 into 1L Terri ﬁc
Broth+100 μg/ml carbenicillen (TB+Carb) and grown at 37/C14 C
and 200 rpm for 3.5 h; then protein expression was induced
with 1 mM isopropylβ-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside and grown
overnight at 16
/C14 C and 200 rpm. The culture was centrifuged
at 5000 rpm for 10 min at 4/C14 C and medium removed. The cell
pellet was resuspended to aﬁnal volume of 50 ml in 50 mM
Hepes pH 7.2, 50 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole (resuspension
buffer). 0.5 mg of DNaseI was added to the suspension and the
cells were sonicated at 4
/C14 C. The lysate was centrifuged for
30 min at 10 k rpm and 4/C14 C, and the supernatant wasﬁltered
through a 0.22μm ﬁlter. The supernatant was incubated with
1 ml of Ni-NTA agarose resin (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) for
2 h (overnight for WT) at 4/C14 C with shaking in a 50 ml falcon
tube. The lysate wasﬂowed through a gravity column, and the
resin was washedﬁve times with 10 ml of resuspension buffer.
The elution buffer (50 mM Hepes pH 7.2, 50 mM NaCl,
300 mM imidazole) was ﬂowed through the column until
minimal signal was detected at A
280. The elutions were incu-
bated at room temperature for 2 h to precipitate contaminants
(for TS-PETase variants only) and then pooled for size-
exclusion chromatography. Five milliliters of pooled elution
(maximum 50 mg of protein based on A
280) was ﬂowed
through a PrepGrade S75 Hi-Load column (Cytiva) (running
buffer: 25 mM Hepes pH 7.2, 50 mM NaCl) and fractions were
collected in 2.5 ml intervals. All fraction peaks were collected
and ran on SDS-PAGE gels, which were stained with Coo-
massie blue R250 (10% acetic acid, 40% methanol, 50% water);
percent purity was assessed using the Fiji densitometry tool
(47). The fractions with IsPETase that corresponded to the
monomeric size of the protein were pooled and dialyzed into
50 mM glycine-NaOH pH 9, 50 mM NaCl overnight at 4
/C14 C.
S75 puriﬁcation results in removal of all residual protein and
nucleic acid contaminants. The amount of protein was
determined using DC protein assay (Bio-Rad) in a 96-well
microplate according to manufacturer directions.
Differential scanning ﬂuorimetry
Thermostabilities of puriﬁed enzymes were measured using
differential scanning ﬂuorimetry. Enzyme concentrations be-
tween 15 to 25 μM were mixed with SyproOrange (1:1000
dilution from stock) to aﬁnal volume of 10 μl in a 96-well
qPCR plate. Theﬂuorescence intensity was measured using a
Bio-Rad CFX96 Real-Time PCR machine (FRET channel)
from 10 to 95
/C14 C with 5 s incubation steps for every 0.5/C14 C
increment.
Enzyme kinetic experiments
All bulk absorbance kinetic experiments were performed as
previously described in 1.5 ml microfuge tubes (GeneMate)
(2). Amorphous PETﬁlm substrates (Goodfellow USA, ES30-
FM-000145) were cut to their respective surface areas:
2 × 5 mm, 5 × 5 mm, 10 × 5 mm, 15 × 5 mm, 19 × 5 mm. The
0.25”-diameter amorphous PET ﬁlms were custom cut by
Goodfellow (ES30-FM-000145). All PET ﬁlms were washed
once in 100% isopropanol, followed by three washes in 70%
ethanol and air dried. Triplicate reactions were run for each
substrate size and enzyme concentration with shaking at
200 rpm. All reactions were performed with the following
reaction buffer: 50 mM glycine-NaOH pH 9, 50 mM NaCl,
10% v/v dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO); the buffer was warmed to
the reaction temperature prior to the experiment. A total
volume of 1 ml of enzyme in reaction buffer was incubated
with PET, and 1.25μl of reaction supernatant was taken for
measurement on the NanoDrop1000 (Thermo Fisher Scienti-
ﬁc) at each time point (every 30 min for 30
/C14 C, 15 min for
55 /C14 C).
Sortase A-tagging of TSP-PETase
TSP-PETase containing a C-terminal LPETGG-His 6-tag
was expressed inE. coli T7 Express and puriﬁed as described
above. The following procedure was performed in the dark.
GGGYK-C(Atto647N)-T(amide) peptide (Millipore Sigma) or
GGGYK-K(SulfoCy5)-T(amide) peptide (21st Century Bio-
chemicals) were used in the tagging reactions. Forty micro-
grams of Sortase A (SrtA) was incubated with 200μl of Ni-
NTA agarose slurry (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc) in 150 mM
Hepes pH 7.2, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl
2 and loaded onto a
2 ml gravity column. Peptide (28μM) and enzyme (20μM) (or
7 and 5 μM for TIRF experiments, respectively) were mixed
together to aﬁnal volume of 3 ml andﬂowed over the gravity
column containing SrtA andﬂow-through was collected. The
ﬂow-through wasﬂowed over the columnﬁve more times. The
column was washed with 3 ml of 7μM peptide and fraction
collected. The ﬂow-through was dialyzed into 500 ml of
50 mM glycine-NaOH pH 9, 50 mM NaCl three times at 4/C14 C
using 10 kDa-cutoff dialysis tubing (ThermoFisher Scientiﬁc).
The dialyzed sample was analyzed using ﬂuorescence SDS-
PAGE (Alexa 647 or Cy5 setting, Bio-Rad ChemiDoc MP) to
ensure proper tagging and removal of peptide. Tagging per-
centage was calculated using A
646 to determine concentration
of ﬂuorescent molecules and DC protein assay to measure
total enzyme concentration.
IsPETase adsorption to PETﬁlms
IsPETase at various concentrations was incubated with or
without 0.25”-diameter amorphous PET ﬁlms (Goodfellow
USA, ES30-FM-000145) in 1 ml of reaction buffer in 1.5 ml
microfuge tubes (GeneMate). The tubes were placed in a 30
/C14 C
incubator and shaken at 200 rpm for 1.5 h (45 min for 55/C14 C).
Fluorescence was measured in three technical replicates for
each sample: 250 μl/well of reaction supernatant was trans-
ferred to a UV-transparent ﬂat-bottom black plate (Greiner
Bio-One) and intrinsic protein ﬂuorescence was measured
(280/345 nm). Fluorescently tagged TSP-PETase was
measured at 646/672 nm (SulfoCy5) and 646/675 nm
(Atto647N). A
260 was also measured to determine relative
product concentrations in the supernatant. For intrinsicﬂuo-
rescence measurements, MHET concentration was calculated
based on the A
260 value and the expected reduction inﬂuo-
rescence was determined based on the MHET 280/345 nm
ﬂuorescence standard curve ( Fig. S4 G). The expected

ﬂuorescence loss was added onto the 280/345 nmﬂuorescence
signal of the corresponding sample, and the corrected value
was used to interpolate enzyme concentration using the pro-
tein ﬂuorescence standard curve (10 – 1000 nM) for each
variant. The rawﬂuorescence intensity of the reaction without
PET was used to interpolate enzyme concentration using the
same standard curves. The difference in enzyme concentration
between the reaction with PET and without PET was used to
calculate the amount of adsorbed enzyme onto the PETﬁlm.
Spin-coating of PET thinﬁlms onto glass slides
Amorphous PET ﬁlm (Goodfellow, ES30-FM-000145) was
dissolved in 85% triﬂuoroacetic acid at 2% w/v and immedi-
ately used for spin-coating. 1”-diameter circular glass slides
(170 μm thick, #1.5H) were cleaned with 70% ethanol and
placed in the center of the spin-coater stage. Dynamic spin-
coating was performed at 3 k rpm with 100μl of PET solu-
tion for each glass slide for 60 s. A thinﬁlm of PET was found
to form over the glass slide that can be peeled off. TSP-
Atto647N was also spotted onto the spun-coated glass slides
and product formation (A
260) was detected, showing successful
coating.
TIRF microscopy
0 to 500 pM solution of TSP-Atto647N in 50 mM glycine-
NaOH pH 9, 50 mM NaCl, 10% v/v DMSO was applied to a
PET-coated glass slide. A sealed chamber using 0.5”-diameter
O-ring and vacuum grease was constructed with 2 glass slides
(one PET-coated and one uncoated) to prevent evaporation
during sample imaging; each chamber contained 250 μlo f
sample. The sample was imaged in a single-molecule TIRF
microscope with 638 nm excitation. The laser power was
reduced to 0.9 to 1.0 mW at the objective to reduce PET
background auto-ﬂuorescence (32). See Supplementary Infor-
mation for microscope details.
TIRF data processing and analysis
Identiﬁcation and extraction of individual ﬂuorescence
traces from camera images, as well as sorting of molecules
were achieved using single-molecule platform for automated
analysis (SPARTAN), a data analysis software tool created for
sCMOS data sets (48). The SPARTAN software has been
modiﬁed to disable automated background corrections.
Molecule detection parameters were set to auto-detection
sensitivity between 6 to 15 depending on image, and mini-
mum distance between overlapping molecules was set to zero
to detect all molecules on the surface; sensitivity was lowered
to ensure sufﬁcient molecule detection or increased to avoid
background noise detection. SPARTAN produces a list of x-y
coordinates for all detected molecules, which were used to
count the number of molecules in each quadrant of theﬁeld of
view (56 μm-diameter). This was done for each enzyme con-
centration at two different locations on the surface. Number of
molecules detected in buffer controls were subtracted from
total number of detected molecules in enzyme samples by
randomly removing coordinates (total number of coordinates
removed equaled number of molecules detected in blank) from
the lists prior to separation distance determination. Using
Fortran code, the distance between each coordinate and all
other coordinates were calculated and the minimum separa-
tion distance was determined for each enzyme concentration
and quadrant in theﬁeld of view. The result is a distribution of
minimum distances for all of the points. The mean of the
distribution is recorded as the mean minimum distance be-
tween points. The mean minimum distance from each of the
eight quadrants for each enzyme concentration was used to
determine SD.
Molecular dynamics simulations ofIsPETase variants with PET
substrate and macromolecular crowding
The initial conﬁguration for control enzyme monomer MD
simulations was generated by centering the free or substrate-
bound IsPETase variant in an orthorhombic box. A minimum
distance of 3 nm was set between the enzyme and the edge of
the box to prevent self-interaction across the periodic boundary
conditions. Enzyme crowding simulations were set up by
placing eight identical freeIsPETase or substrate-boundIsPE-
Tase conﬁgurations in a 188 × 188 × 188 Å
3 box spaced evenly
apart. This results in approximately 94 Å between every enzyme
pair’s center-of-masses corresponding to a 2 mM concentration.
All systems were solvated with the TIP3P water model (49)a n d
the total system charge was neutralized using chlorine ions. TS-
PETase model was attained by performingin silicomutagenesis
of the WTIsPETase crystal structure (24) (PDB ID: 6EQE) in
PyMOL (50) and parametrized with the AMBER14SB forceﬁeld
(51). PET pentamer substrate model used in docking and MD
simulations was parametrized using the General Amber Force
Field 2 (GAFF2) (52). Molecular docking of the PET substrate
to theIsPETase variants was performed in AutoDock Vina (53),
with a chosen PET conﬁguration that is consistent with previ-
ously reported docking experiments (6, 24). MD simulations
were performed in GROMACS (54). Following energy mini-
mization and equilibration steps, MD production simulations
for all systems were performed for 250 ns in the NPT ensemble
at 300K and 1 bar. Constant temperature and pressure were
maintained by a velocity rescale thermostat ( 55)a n da
Parrinello-Rahman barostat (56), respectively. All simulations
utilized a 2 fs time step with the LINCS (57) algorithm to
constrain bonding between hydrogen and heavy atoms. Long-
range electrostatic interactions were calculated using Particle
Mesh Ewald summation with a 1.2 nm cutoff (58). From 250 ns
MD simulations of the free and substrate-bound IsPETase
variants under crowding and control conditions, protein
structure equilibrium was observed in all systems after 200 ns so
all analysis was performed over theﬁnal 50 ns of simulation
trajectories. Simulation trajectories were post-processed in
GROMACS and visualized with Visual Molecular Dynamics
(59). RMSD and RMSF were performed with their respective
built-in GROMACS functions. Hydrogen bonding calculation
among enzyme catalytic triad residues (29) (S160, D206, and
H237) was performed with 3.5 Å donor-acceptor distance and
30
/C14 angle cutoffs using the HBonds plugin tool in VMD. The

with Nδ1-H of H237. Quantiﬁcation of sampled productive
active site conformations from hydrogen bonding analysis of
catalytic triad residues was carried out similarly as outlined in
the work of Guoet al.on IsPETase mutants (30).
Macromolecular crowding with Ficoll 70
Ficoll 70 was dissolved in 50 mM glycine-NaOH pH 9,
50 mM NaCl, 10% v/v DMSO (reaction buffer) at a concen-
tration of 400 mg/ml and subsequently diluted to 100, 200, and
300 mg/ml using reaction buffer. All buffers were centrifuged
at 5000 rpm for 1 min to remove air bubbles. BHET, at aﬁnal
concentration of 500μM, was added to all buffer conditions
and incubated with 40 nM of IsPETase (or no enzyme for
blank controls) in 500μl reactions for 1 h at 30
/C14 C. Reactions
were stopped 1:1 with 200 mM phosphate pH 2.5 buffer and
ﬁltered for HPLC analysis (SeeSupplementary Informationfor
HPLC methods).
Parameter estimation for kinetic model
The biochemical kinetic model established by Equations6,
17 and 18 contains ﬁve ﬁtting parameters (Ka, Kc, Γ, kcat,uc, and
kcat,c). Parameters wereﬁt in two steps for each of the studied
enzymes. In the ﬁrst step, adsorption parameters (Ka and Γ)
were ﬁt using maximum-likelihood estimation in the log space
of the parameters (60).
bθ ¼ argθ min ðy−~yðθÞÞT V−1
e ðy−~yðθÞÞ (23)
where bθ is a vector of the estimated parameters,y is a vector
containing the experimental observations, ~y (θ) is a vector
containing model predictions with parameter setθ, andVe
−1 is
the measurement uncertainty covariance matrix. These
adsorption parameters then served as priors for the second
step ofﬁtting, in which allﬁve parameters (Ka, Kc, Γ, kcat,uc, and
kcat,c) were ﬁt using maximum a posteriori estimation in the
log space of the parameters
bθ ¼ argθ min ðy−~yðθÞÞT V −1

(24)
where μ is a vector of the parameter values predicted in the
prior step andVμ is a matrix of the covariance of the param-
eters ﬁt in the prior step. This formulation instills a penalty for
adjusting the parametersﬁt in previous steps. The values forμ
and Vμ are set such that the parameters beingﬁt for theﬁrst
time in the second or third steps do not instill any cost.
Optimization and simulation were performed using Math-
Works MATLAB software. Optimization was performed using
a multi-start approach with an interior point algorithm and
2000 random initialization points for each enzyme. All pa-
rameters were scaled by log(θ) during optimization to improve
the speed of searching the parameter space and to constrain
parameter values to positive values.
