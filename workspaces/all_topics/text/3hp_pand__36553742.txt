Abstract: The reuterin system is a complex multi-component antimicrobial system produced by
Limosilactobacillus reuteriby metabolizing glycerol. The system mainly includes 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde
(3-HPA, reuterin), 3-HPA dimer, 3-HPA hydrate, acrolein and 3-hydroxypropionic acid, and has
great potential to be applied in the food and medical industries due to its functional versatility. It
has been reported that the reuterin system possesses regulation of intestinal ﬂora and anti-infection,
anti-inﬂammatory and anti-cancer activities. Typically, the reuterin system exerts strong broad-
spectrum antimicrobial properties. However, the antimicrobial mechanism of the reuterin system
remains unclear, and its toxicity is still controversial. This paper presents an updated review on the
biosynthesis, composition, biological production, antimicrobial mechanisms, stability, toxicity and
potential applications of the reuterin system. Challenges and opportunities of the use of the reuterin
system as a food preservative or health-promoting agent are also discussed. The present work will
allow researchers to accelerate their studies toward solving critical challenges obstructing industrial
applications of the reuterin system.

1. Introduction
In recent years, negative public perception of chemical preservatives prompts an
increasing preference of consumers for “natural” agents from biological systems as alter-
natives [1,2]. To meet the consumers’ demand for “natural preservatives”, essential oils
extracted from plants [3,4], bacteriocins from lactic acid bacteria such as nisin or pediocin
P Aß1-AcH and bacteriocin-producing protective cultures such asCarnobacterium maltaromaticum
UAL307 (Micocin® [5,6]) are used commercially as food preservatives. However, high
production cost, narrow antimicrobial spectrum and limited antimicrobial activity chal-
lenge the application of these “natural preservatives” [2]. Further improvement in food
safety and quality still necessitates the development of novel antimicrobial agents from
natural origins.
The reuterin system is a multi-component antimicrobial complex produced by Limosi-
lactobacillus reuteri by metabolizing glycerol. Reuterin was ﬁrst discovered in the 1980s
by Axelsso et al. [7], who observed that resting cells of L. reuteri converted glycerol into a
low-molecular-weight, non-protein, antimicrobial substance, which was later referred as
reuterin. Further research veriﬁed that reuterin is a dynamic multi-compound equilibrated
system consisting mainly of 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde(3-HPA), its dimer, its hydrate and
acrolein in aqueous solution [8,9]. Reuterin generally refers to 3-HPA, because 3-HPA is
not only the precursor of other reuterin compounds but also considered to be the main
antimicrobial component in the system. Among the reuterin-producing bacteria, including
Bacillus, Klebsiella, Citrobacter, Enterobacter, Clostridium and Lactobacillus [10], the food-grade
L. reuteri strains are the most suitable for reuterin production at industrial scale due to

their high availability, probiotic properties, safety and high yield. Reuterin is generally
produced by a two-step process using resting L. reuteri cultured with a glycerol–water
solution, in which the yield is more than 3 times greater than that of the one-step pro-
cess [11]. Quantiﬁcation of 3-HPA can be achieved by colorimetric methods, HPLC, LC–MS,
IC-PAD, etc., while lack of commercialized 3-HPA may affect the accuracy of measure-
ment. The antimicrobial mechanism of the reuterin system remains unclear due to the
complexity and dynamic nature of the system. Nevertheless, the reuterin system exhibits a
broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against pathogens and spoilage organisms, including
Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, yeasts, fungi, protozoa, viruses [12] and even
antibiotic-resistant bacteria [13,14]. Gram-negative bacteria are usually more sensitive to
the reuterin system than Gram-positive bacteria [15–17]. Remarkably, most Lactobacillus
species are less sensitive to reuterin, especially L. reuteri [18]. Antimicrobial activities of the
reuterin system in vitro have been well-reviewed by Stevens et al. [12]. For example, the
minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of 3-HPA on genera ofEnterococcus, Eubacterium
and Bacteroides is as low as 7.5 mM.
The reuterin system exhibits antimicrobial activities in different food matrices in-
cluding dairy products and meat [19,20]. Moreover, the system also has some potential
health-promoting effects, such as conjugating heterocyclic amines, regulating the gut mi-
crobiota and anti-infection [21–23]. However, many factors still limit the application of
the reuterin system at industrial scales. This paper aims to provide a critical review of the
reuterin system including its biosynthesis, composition, biological production, antimicro-
bial mechanism, potential applications as a food preservative or health-promoting agent as
well as challenges in industrial production of the reuterin system for commercial purposes,
which may stimulate new ideas and suggestions toward its practical use.
2. Biosynthesis and Composition of the Reuterin System
L. reuteri converts glycerol, as the electron acceptor, into an intermediate compound
3-HPA by the coenzyme B12-dependent glycerol dehydratase (GDH) in cells under anaero-
bic conditions. GDH exists as a dimer of subunits α2, β2 and γ2. The nucleotide and amino
acid sequences of GDH are highly conserved in L. reuteri [24,25]. After being excreted out-
side the cell, 3-HPA forms a multi-compound dynamic reuterin system in aqueous solution,
which includes 3-HPA, 3-HPA hydrate, 3-HPA dimer and acrolein. Moreover, 3-HPA in
the cell is further reduced to 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PD) by the 1,3-PD oxidoreductase (an
NADH-linked dehydrogenase) and spontaneously transformed into a structural isomer of
lactic acid, 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP), in three stages. First, 3-HPA is converted to
3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA (3-HP CoA) by the propionaldehyde dehydrogenase. Second,
3-HP CoA is phosphorylated to 3-hydroxypropionyl phosphate (3-HP-P) by the phosphate
propanoyltransferase. Finally, dephosphorylation of 3-HP-P leads to the formation of 3HP
catalyzed by the propionate kinase [26]. Notably, 1,3-PD and 3-HP can also be secreted [12].
A detailed metabolic pathway of reuterin and the components of the reuterin system are
shown in Figure 1.
Gene islands are clusters of genes that are likely to be associated with the horizontal
gene transfer events in bacteria. The genomic island in L. reuteri is believed to be related to
the evolution of its probiotic properties in the human gut. The complicated biosynthesis of
reuterin is determined by a genomic island containing a 1,2-propanediol utilization (pdu)
cluster together with a vitamin B12 cluster (namely the pdu-cbi-cob-hem gene cluster) [27],
which is proposed to be transcriptionally arranged as seen in Figure 2. The island harbors
the pocR gene (lreu_1750)-encoding protein PocR that participates in both glycerol utiliza-
tion and B12 biosynthesis [28]. The ability of L. reuteri to produce vitamin B12 is generally
considered to be associated with 3-HPA production. Biosynthesis of 3-HPA from glycerol
by vitamin B12-dependent glycerol dehydratase is encoded by gupCDE (pduCDE) in the
pdu operon [27]. The pduF gene encodes a hydrophobic protein that facilitates the diffusion
of glycerol [29]. The pduL, pduP and pduW confer the transformation of 3-HPA to 3-HP [30].

3. Biotechnological Production of Reuterin
Reuterin (3-HPA) is the precursor of the reuterin system’s components. Although
3-HPA can be produced by chemical synthesis with acrolein dehydration, the reaction has
to be completed at high temperature, high pressure and relatively high cost [10]. Biological
production of 3-HPA has the advantage of mild reaction conditions, high yield and low
cost compared with chemical synthesis [ 10]. Production of 3-HPA by fermentation is
carried out by the in situ process or the two-step process. The former is usually achieved
by metabolizing glycerol by L. reuteri in MRS medium, but low yield and a complicated
puriﬁcation process limit its application. The latter involves preparing a crude 3-HPA
solution by a simple two-step process followed by puriﬁcation [ 11]. Speciﬁcally, a large
number of whole cells of L. reuteri are ﬁrstly collected from the MRS medium. Secondly,
washed cells are incubated in a glycerol–water solution to produce 3-HPA. Finally, 3-HPA
is puriﬁed by ion exchange resin, chromatography or reactive distillation methods [32–35].
There are some factors that affect the production of 3-HPA in the two-step process,
such as glycerol concentration, biomass, incubation time, incubation temperature, etc.
Bauer et al. [ 36] studied the effect of glycerol concentration (100~400 mM) on 3-HPA
production and found that 300mM glycerol had the highest 3-HPA yield (27 mM) at
a resting cell concentration of 1 ×109 CFU/mL after 120 min of incubation at 20 ◦C,
indicating that high concentrations of glycerol possibly inhibited the glycerol dehydratase
activity of resting cells. L. reuteri was immobilized in spherical calcium alginate beads
to increase 3-HPA productivity [37]. Moreover, the production of 3-HPA was expedited
at pH 6, while no signiﬁcant difference was found at incubation temperatures of 15 ◦C
and 37 ◦C. Addition of lactate in the glycerol–water solution had a positive impact on
the accumulation of 3-HPA while glucose showed the opposite result [ 38]. However,
Doleyres et al. [11] reported that the maximum 3-HPA level (235 mM) was obtained using
400 mM glycerol, 1.6 ×1010 CFU/mL resting cells, incubation temperatures of 30 ◦C and
an incubation time of 45 min in the glycerol–water solution. These parameters of optimal
3-HPA production are inconsistent and likely strain-dependent.
The challenge of 3-HPA production with glycerol is the toxicity of 3-HPA accumulated
to L. reuteri. To solve this problem, bisulﬁte can be used to entrap 3-HPA to form a non-toxic
3-HPA–bisulﬁte complex that can markedly increase glycerol conversion by the resting
cells. The produced 3-HPA can then be released from the complex by an ion exchange
resin [39].
4. Antimicrobial Mechanisms
Even though the antimicrobial mechanism of the reuterin system remains unclear
and controversial, the structures of some antimicrobial compounds in the system have
been analyzed and their antimicrobial mechanisms are initially proposed (Figure 3). The
3-HPA dimer may exhibit antimicrobial activity through acting as a competitive inhibitor
of the ribonucleotide reductase that is responsible for DNA synthesis of cells [ 33]. The
antimicrobial activity of 3-HPA may be attributed to the aldehyde groups of 3-HPA, which
can induce oxidative damages to bacteria by depletion of free sulfhydryl groups in small
proteins and other molecules such as reduced glutathione and enzymes [ 9,40]. Further-
more, 3-HPA at concentrations of more than 10µM can downregulate the virulence gene
expression in Helicobacter pylori including vacA, ﬂaA and luxS [41]. Notably, acrolein may
deplete the free sulfhydryl groups of reduced glutathione and other enzymes through
a Michael addition reaction and, thus, may induce oxidative damages to bacteria and
contribute to the antimicrobial activity of the reuterin system [42]. In addition, 3-HP acts
synergistically with acrolein in inhibiting microbial growth [30,43]. Overall, the applica-
tion of the reuterin system as a food preservative still necessitates more insights into its
antimicrobial mechanisms.

5. Stability 
The stability of the reuterin system is affected by temperature, media, pH, etc. Addi-
tionally, 3-HPA is highly soluble in water, resistant to proteases, lipases, nucleases and 
liable to heat (100 °C for 10 min) [12,44]. The 3-HPA content in the supernatant produced 
by the two-step process was stable at −20 °C for at least 35 days, and then it slowly de-
creased. Moreover, repeated freeze–thaw cycles ( −20/4 °C) caused a slow decrease in 3-
HPA with every cycle [23]. In addition, the deg radation of 3-HPA to acrolein in aqueous 
solution was greater at high temperatures (3 7 °C and 40 °C), while there was very little 
degradation at 4 °C for 4 weeks [45]. Similarly, IC-PAD analysis suggested that 3-
HPA/acrolein did not interconvert at low temperature and acidic pH [42]. 
3-HPA is much more stable in aqueous solution than that in milk or MRS media [46]. 
After 1 h of treatment at 100 °C, the level of 3-HPA in MRS produced by the one-step 
fermentation process significantly reduced, but was not notably affected in the glycerol–
water solution produced by the two-step ferm entation process [47]. After stirred yogurt 
was made from raw milk containing purified 3-HPA, 3-HPA level decreased by more than 
90% during 15 days of storage at 21 °C, but the reduction was slower at 4 °C. This is likely 
due to the fact that 3-HPA can form Schiff bases with the proteins in milk [48]. Some ex-
amples concerning stability of the reuterin system are summarized in Table 1.

6. Toxicity of the Reuterin System
The impact of the reuterin system on human health is critical to its application in the
food and medical industries. In the cytotoxicity assay using the human hepatoma cell
line HepG2, the puriﬁed 3-HPA was much less toxic than acrolein and only four times
more toxic than the generally recognized as safe (GRAS) ﬂavoring diacetyl, implying a
low possibility of reuterin to cause in vivo disturbance [ 50]. In the assay using in vitro
models of the gastrointestinal tract, the 3-HPA did not affect the viability or the membrane
integrity of Caco-2 cells at less than 1080 mM. Furthermore, 3-HPA had no hemolytic effect
on blood cells at 270 mM [51]. In addition, the puriﬁed 3-HPA at bactericidal concentrations
of 40 mg/L did not exert any skin toxicity [52].
Acrolein (2-propenal) is the main toxicant in the reuterin system, and is easily con-
verted from 3-HPA at moderate temperature. Acrolein is commonly found in foods, and
also found in the human body from endogenous production and/or dietary routes [ 53].
The toxicity of acrolein alone has been well-studied. The World Health Organization has
classiﬁed acrolein as a class 2A carcinogen, and established a provisional tolerable oral
acrolein intake of 7.5 µg kg−1 bw day−1 for non-neoplastic effects [54]. Acrolein produced
by GDH-competent intestinal bacteria by metabolizing glycerol can lead to the formation
of the acrolein-DNA adduct, which may induce mutations in a model system containing
resting cells of L. reuteri in combination with calf thymus DNA or bovine serum albumin.
However, the concentration of glycerol needed to cause the acrolein-DNA adduct-mediated
mutation was much higher than the physiological concentration [ 55]. Nevertheless, the
association between the carcinogenicity of acrolein observed in cytotoxicity assays and
human health remains hypothetical, and has not been veriﬁed in clinic trials yet [56]. Al-
though the reuterin system appears to be safe based on the results from short-term toxicity
tests, the dynamic nature and complexity of the system are worthy of more attention.
Therefore, studies on the dynamic changes of the reuterin system and long-term toxicity
evaluation are necessary for the safety use of reuterin.
7. Potential Applications of the Reuterin System
7.1. Food Preservative
The reuterin system has great potential as a food preservative due to its strong antimi-
crobial activity in various types of foods and high stability under different food-processing
conditions. Reuterin can be used as a food preservative to extend the shelf life using the fol-
lowing approaches: (i) addition of 3-HPA-producing Lactobacillus and food-grade glycerol
to the food to achieve in situ production of reuterin compounds, which does not require
regulatory approval or label declarations [57], (ii) addition of puriﬁed, semi-puriﬁed or
other forms of 3-HPA to the food, (iii) addition of 3-HPA to the food, followed by treatment
with other antimicrobial hurdles.
7.1.1. Dairy Products
The antimicrobial activity of the reuterin system has been validated in milk, yogurt
and cheese (Table 2). Addition of L. reuteri and glycerol (50 mM) in milk, cheese and yogurt
can produce sufﬁcient 3-HPA to exert antimicrobial activity during manufacturing and
storage [58]. Remarkably, addition of high concentrations of glycerol at more than 200 mM
increased the redness of cheese, which may be attributed to the reaction of the excess
glycerol with cheese components [ 59]. In situ production of 3-HPA prevented the late
blowing defect caused by Clostridium tyrobutyricum in semi-hard ewe milk cheese [60,61].
Either in situ-produced or puriﬁed 3-HPA can exert antimicrobial effects in yogurt. In-
creased yellowish color was observed in the yogurt with 3-HPA at concentrations over
69 mM [17,62]. Nisin, lacticin 481 and enterocin AS-48 acted synergistically with 3-HPA in
inactivating Staphylococcus aureus in milk, but this synergistic effect was not observed for
Escherichia coli O157:H7, Salmonella enterica, Yersinia enterocolitica, Aeromonas hydrophila and
Campylobacter jejuni [19]. These studies suggest that the reuterin system can be applied as a
preservative in dairy products.

to humans through contaminated meat products, especially raw or undercooked meat [71].
The use of the reuterin system can inactivate various foodborne pathogens in meat and
meat products (Table 3). The reuterin system produced by L. reuteri completely killed
E. coli O157:H7 by at least 3.0 log CFU/g in ground beef at 4 ◦C at day 20 [72]. The use of
L. reuteri and glycerol as meat starter cultures reduced the cell counts of E. coli O157:H7
by at least 1.0 log CFU/g during fermentation [20]. In situ-produced 3-HPA also reduced
Campylobacter isolated from chicken meat [31].

Puriﬁed 3-HPA inhibited the growth of L. monocytogenes on the surface of cooked pork
and sausages at refrigerated conditions without any alteration in meat quality [78,79]. Single
or combined use of puriﬁed 3-HPA and high hydrostatic pressure (HHP) at 450 MPa for
5 min inhibited the growth ofL. monocytogenes in cold-smoked salmon [80,81]. These studies
suggest that the reuterin system is able to improve the quality of meat and ﬁsh products.
7.1.3. Other Products
Incorporation of 3-HPA in pectin-based edible coatings signiﬁcantly reduced viable
Penicillium spp. on strawberries by 2.0 log CFU/g without quality deterioration over
31 days of cold storage [ 82]. Washing fresh-cut lettuce with the reuterin solution con-
taining 7.2–21.9 mM acrolein at 4 ◦C reduced Enterobacteriaceae, yeasts and molds by
2.1–2.8 log CFU/g and 1.3–2.0 log CFU/g, respectively. It needs to be noted that this treat-
ment resulted in the discoloration of lettuce [83]. The undesirable discoloring effect of the
reuterin system on vegetables is dose-dependent and limits the use of the reuterin system
in fresh produce. The reuterin system is also not suitable as a preservative in bakery foods
such as bread, because the baking process may eliminate its antimicrobial activity [47].
7.2. Health-Promoting Effects
Despite a lack of clinical trails, several in vitro and in vivo studies demonstrate that
the reuterin system exhibits certain health-promoting effects including anti-infection, anti-
inﬂammation and anti-cancer activities, presumably through interacting with host micro-
biota and through alterations in metabolome.
7.2.1. Anti-Infective and Anti-Inﬂammatory Effect
Co-delivery of L. reuteri with glycerol was effective against C. difﬁcile colonization in
complex human fecal microbial communities, whereas the single use of glycerol orL. reuteri
Foods 2022, 11, 4000 9 of 16
was ineffective. A global unbiased microbiome and metabolomics analysis conﬁrmed
that glycerol precursor delivery with L. reuteri altered the composition and function of
the human microbial community that preferentially targeted C. difﬁcile outgrowth and
toxicity [84]. In a novel in vitro colonic fermentation model where adult immobilized fecal
microbiota were treated with reuterin, the addition of glycerol alone or in combination with
L. reuteri increased numbers of the Lactobacillus–Enterococcus group and decreased E. coli
without affecting other bacterial populations. The selective decrease in E. coli populations
may be due to in situ reuterin production. These ﬁndings indicate that the reuterin system
can prevent intestinal infection [85]. Moreover, the effectiveness of 3-HPA produced by
L. reuteri in protection against intestinal Salmonella infections was also validated using a
three-dimensional organotypic model of human colonic epithelium [86].
The frequent emergence of antibiotic-resistant pathogens has become a major threat
to public health worldwide. Presently, there is no report on the resistance of pathogenic
microorganisms to the reuterin system. Reuterin was considered to have a bactericidal
effect on methicillin-resistant S. aureus [13]. Bennett et al. [14] reported that reuterin was
the most effective against multidrug-resistant bacteria causing bovine mastitis, compared
with nisin, bactofein and pediocin. The reuterin system may be a new alternative to reduce
the emergence of resistant organisms and treat infections caused by resistant organisms.
7.2.2. Cancer Chemopreventive and Anticancer Effect
Heterocyclic aromatic amines (HAAs), such as 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo
[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP), are potentially highly mutagenic and/or carcinogenic food-derived
contaminants formed in processed meat products. 3-HPA is produced by speciﬁc gut
microorganisms from glycerol including L. reuteri, and then forms the reuterin system
consisting of acrolein. Vanhaecke et al. [ 87] found that human intestinal bacteria were
capable of transforming the dietary carcinogen PhIP into 7-hydroxy-5-methyl-3-phenyl-
6,7,8,9-tetrahydropyrido [3′,2′:4,5]imidazo [1,2 a]pyrimidin-5-ium chloride (PhIP-M1) by
the glycerol metabolite 3-HPA. Fekry et al. [88] suggested that the transformation of PhIP
into PhIP-M1 is a detoxiﬁcation process. Beer et al. [22] reported that acrolein in the reuterin
system likely reacted with HAAs to form conjugates that blocked the exocyclic amino group
of HAAs, thereby diminishing their ability to form DNA adducts that cause mutagenicity.
Recently, Bell et al. [89] reported that 3-HPA produced byL. reuteri in the healthy in-
testinal microbiome inhibited colon tumorigenesis, decreased tumor growth and prolonged
survival in mice by inducing protein oxidation and inhibiting ribosomal biogenesis in vivo
and in vitro.
7.2.3. Fixation and Sanitization of Biological Tissues
3-HPA is more bactericidal but less cytotoxic than the most commonly used sterilant
and crosslinker glutaraldehyde for biological tissues [90,91]. Although the rate of tissue
ﬁxation by 3-HPA is slower than that by glutaraldehyde, 3-HPA-ﬁxed tissue has a reduced
inﬂammatory reaction and comparable tensile strengths, calciﬁcation and resistance against
degradation and free-amino group content [ 92,93]. Additionally, reuterin–polymerized
pyridoxylated hemoglobin (RR-PLP-Hb) solution is a new option in the development of
blood substitutes, because the solution has a lower oxygen afﬁnity and longer vascular
retention time than the unmodiﬁed Hb solution [94].
7.2.4. Other Bioactivities
Ingestion of reuterin may also exhibit other health promoting effects. Oral adminis-
tration of the reuterin supernatant altered the fecal microbiome, decreased heptane and
increased 3-methylbutanal in the feces of mice, suggesting the high potential of the reuterin
system to relieve some diseases caused by the dysbiosis of intestinal ﬂora [ 23]. Oral
treatment of broilers with water supplemented with a combination of 5 mM 3-HPA and
0.08 mM microcin J25 promoted growth performance and improved health, presumably
through alterations in the cecal microbiome and metabolome, indicating the potential of
Foods 2022, 11, 4000 10 of 16
3-HPA as a growth promoter instead of as an antibiotic in animals [ 95]. Das et al. [ 96]
found that 3-HPA effectively ameliorated iron overload diseases via suppressing hypoxia-
inducible factor 2α (HIF-2α), a master transcription factor of intestinal iron absorption,
using a high-throughput screen of gut microbial metabolites. More examples concerning
health-promoting effects of the reuterin system are given in Table 4.

8. Conclusions and Future Perspectives
The reuterin system produced by L. reuteri is a multi-component dynamic equilibrium
system that was discovered nearly forty years ago. The system has powerful broad-
spectrum anti-microbial actions. Many factors can affect the composition of the system,
such as temperature, pH and other chemical compositions. Due to the dynamic nature
and lack of a fast, effective real-time assay, the contributions of speciﬁc substances in the
system to the antimicrobial activity and modes of action have not been fully clariﬁed.
Thus, it is non-scientiﬁc to use only 3-HPA to represent the effective concentration of the
system in most research. If the above problems are not solved, it will be difﬁcult to achieve
standardized production of commercial products of the reuterin system.
Numerous studies have shown the great potential of the reuterin system as a food
preservative. However, most studies have only focused on the antibacterial effect and
neglected its interaction with food components. For instance, there is a need to further
investigate the reasons why the reuterin system tends to cause color changes in dairy
products. Moreover, there are few research reports on the application of the system for
vegetables, fruits and agriculture-based food products. Although the reuterin system has
shown many health-promoting effects, in vivo and clinical studies are still lacking.
Conclusive toxicological data are the key to practical applications of the reuterin system
in food and medicinal fields. The fate of the reuterin system from different sources should be
fully evaluated, such as in situ-produced and purified 3-HPA. It is necessary to understand
the metabolism and biotransformation pathways of the system in the body, including the
skin, oral cavity, gastrointestinal tract, etc. Acute, subacute and long-term exposures of the
system should be performed to obtain the safe dose range for various applications.
This review presents several insights into the dynamic nature of the reuterin system
and provides critical examination on the use of the reuterin system as a food preservative
or health promoting agent. Further research of the reuterin system should be carried out
regarding production, antimicrobial mechanism, toxicity, bioactivities and its interactions
with other food components. In addition, the efﬁcacy of the reuterin system as a food
preservative or health-boosting agent still needs to be validated in large-scale industries.
