ABSTRACT
Background: Paracetamol is one of the most popular drugs; it is used daily by many people especially the elderly, 
without a limitation on the length of the period allowed for continuous use. Harms from long-term use are less clear, 
particularly in extrahepatic regions.
Aim: This study aimed to investigate whether using paracetamol at a non-observable adverse effect level dose, known 
not to cause toxic effects, for a long period can induce toxicity in aged male albino rats. 
Methods: A daily dose of 500 mg per kg body weight of paracetamol was given to adult male albino rats for 12 
weeks. During this period, rats were sacrificed at 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks to evaluate the toxic changes at several time 
intervals.
Results: Chemical analysis revealed elevated serum alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, 
urea, creatinine, and declined level of total protein in N-acetyl-p-aminophenol (APAP)-treated group; it also caused 
oxidative stress, as shown by decreased glutathione, superoxide dismutase, and elevated malondialdehyde in the liver, 
kidney, and brain. Histopathological examination demonstrated cytoplasmic vacuolation and sinusoidal congestion 
with the development of single-cell necrosis in the liver. Renal tubular necrosis, glomerular atrophy, and ischemic 
neuronal injury, especially in the hippocampus were observed. the deleterious effects of APAP were increased in 
severity with increasing the period of treatment. 
Conclusion: Our results suggest that acetaminophen in a subtoxic dose for a long period could result in mild toxic 
effects on the liver but more serious lesions in the kidney and brain. 
Keywords: Drug side effects, Paracetamol toxicity, Prolonged drug use, Analgesics.
Introduction
One of the most used medications in the world is 
acetaminophen, N-acetyl-p-aminophenol (APAP), which 
is also called paracetamol. It is easily accessible without 
prescription in the majority of countries (Brune et al., 
2015) and is included on the WHO’s list of essential 
medications (World Health Organization, 2021). However, 
paracetamol poisoning is among the most frequent causes 
of hepatic dysfunction worldwide and in the USA. In 
the US, it causes 56,000 admissions to the emergency 
department, 2,600 cases are getting hospitalized, and 500 
fatalities per year. Unintentional overdoses account for 
50% of these cases(Caparrotta et al., 2018).
Acetaminophen use by the elderly is an area of concern; 
however, it is used by approximately 90% of older 
adults at an average dose of 3–4 g per day (Blieden 
et al., 2014).
It is important to assess the impact of prolonged 
APAP use. This enables public officials to approve 
its availability in over-the-counter medications and 
aids doctors in evaluating patient benefits and risks. 
The toxic outcomes of acute APAP overdosing have 
been extensively explored (Ferner et al., 2011). More 
attention must be paid to the deleterious consequences 
of prolonged usage at nontoxic levels.
Our objective of this study is to investigate the 
consequences of treating aged rats with a no observed 
adverse effect level dose of APAP (500 mg per kilogram 
body weight) (Venkatesan et al., 2014) daily for a long 
period (up to 12 weeks) on many organs and if the toxic 
effect of acetaminophen would increase with increasing 
period of treatment through assessment of toxicity at 
several time intervals (after 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 weeks of 
APAP administration). 
Materials and Methods
Animals 
Fifty male Wistar rats, 24 months old, with a median 
body weight of 380 g, obtained from “Vacsera Farm,”

Helwan, were randomly distributed in cages (5 rats 
per cage) in an adequately ventilated house that had a 
12:12 hours light/dark cycle and unlimited accessibility 
to ration and water. Rats were left to adapt to their 
environment for 2 weeks. 
Experimental design 
Rats have been separated into an APAP-treated group 
(25 rats) and a control group (25 rats). APAP was 
obtained from Amon Pharmaceutical Co., (Egypt). 
The APAP–treated group received 500 mg per kg b.w.t 
(Venkatesan et al., 2014) daily. After 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12 
weeks of administration, 10 rats (5 APAP-treated and 5 
control rats) were sacrificed each time. 
Blood and tissue sampling
Before sacrifice, animals were anesthetized using 
ketamine 125 mg/kg and xylazine 10 mg/kg b.w.t 
injected intraperitoneally (Veilleux-Lemieux et al., 
2013). Blood samples were collected from the retro-
orbital plexus and allowed to clot. After that, the 
blood was centrifugated at 3,500 rounds/minute for 10 
minutes to separate serum which was kept at −20°C until 
analyzed. Hepatic, renal, and brain tissue specimens 
were fixed in a 10% buffered formalin for histological 
analysis. In addition, liver, kidney, and brain tissue 
specimens were immediately placed in liquid nitrogen 
then samples were kept at −80°C. The body weights of 
all rats were recorded before each sacrifice. 
Blood serum biochemical analysis
Kits for the enzymes aspartate transaminase (AST), 
alanine transaminase (ALT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), 
creatinine, and urea were purchased from Biodiagnostic 
Co., Egypt. The transaminase activities were determined 
calorimetrically as a change in absorbance/minute at 
the wavelength 505 nm, as described by Reitman and 
Frankel (1957). Serum ALP activity was detected 
colorimetrically at the wavelength 510 nm according to 
Belfield and Goldberg (1971). Creatinine was detected 
according to Bartels et al. (1972) and urea levels were 
measured using the method of Fawcett and Scott 
(1960). Serum total protein kits were obtained from 
Spectrum Diagnostics., Al-Obour city, Cairo, Egypt, 
and determined by the colorimetric method at 546 nm 
wavelength according to Sapan et al. (1999).
Antioxidants
Liver, kidney, and brain tissue that were preserved 
at −80°C were used to estimate levels of reduced 
glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and 
malondialdehyde (MDA) using commercial kits. GSH 
kits were purchased (CAT No. GR 2511, Biodiagnostic 
Co., Egypt) and activities were determined by 
colorimetric method at 405-nanometer wavelength 
according to Beutler et al. (1963), SOD kits were obtained 
as (CAT No. SD 2521, Biodiagnostic Co., Egypt) and 
were determined colorimetrically at the wavelength of 
560 nm according to Nishikimi et al. (1972), MDA kits 
were also obtained (CAT No. MD 2529, Biodiagnostic 
Co., Egypt) and levels were detected by colorimetry at 
534 nm wavelength according to Kei (1978). 
Histopathological examination 
Samples were fixed in formalin for at least 24 hours and 
dehydrated in graded concentrations of ethanol, followed 
by xylene clearing, impregnation in soft paraffin, and 
embedded in hard paraffin wax. Blocks were sectioned 
at 5 μm and mounted on slides, then slides were prepared 
and stained routinely with hematoxylin and eosin stain 
(Bancroft and Gamble, 2008) for histopathological 
examination. Histopathological lesions in the liver, 
kidney, and brain of each group were graded and scored 
according to a three-point score depending on vascular 
changes (0–4), degeneration (0–4), and necrosis (0–4).
Statistical analysis 
GraphPad Prism 5 was used to calculate the means and 
SD of the means of each group for all generated data. 
One-way analysis of variance and Tukey’s multiple 
comparison tests were applied to determine the 
significant difference between the treated groups and 
the control group and between all treated groups at the 
five points of sacrifice. p-values <0.05 were regarded as 
a significant difference. A two-way analysis of variance 
was used to analyze data on body weights.
Ethical approval
All procedures were ethically approved by the 
institutional animal care and use committee (IACUC), 
Kafrelsheikh University, approval number: KFS-
IACUC/147/2023.
Results
No mortalities or abnormal clinical signs were noticed 
during the study. The mean body weights of treated rats 
were not significantly different from the control group at 
any of the sacrifice points, according to statistics (Fig. 1).
Biochemical findings
An elevated levels of transaminases, ALP, urea, and 
creatinine, and declined levels of total protein were 
observed in the APAP-treated group, with an increasing 
of their significance levels. The difference from the 
control was statistically significant starting from 10 
weeks of APAP treatment in ALT and 6 weeks in the 
case of AST and ALP (Table 1). Urea, creatinine, and

total protein were significantly higher than the control 
group after APAP treatment throughout the experiment. 
Activities of hepatic, renal, and brain GSH and 
SOD were decreased, whereas MDA levels were 
increased with increasing periods of APAP treatment. 
A statistically significant difference in hepatic GSH, 
SOD, and MDA started in the 10th week after APAP 
administration; however, they started in the sixth week 
in the kidney and brain tissues (Figs. 2–4).
Histopathological finding
liver
The livers of APAP-treated rats in comparison with 
controls revealed only mild congestion after 4 weeks 
and mild cytoplasmic vacuolation after 6 weeks. 
Single-cell necrosis was found after 8 weeks. The 
degree of vacuolar degeneration, single-cell necrosis, 
and sinusoidal congestion increased in the following 
sacrifices, but the picture of pericentral hepatocytic 
necrosis, known to occur with high doses, was not 
found (Fig. 5). Statistical analysis of the hepatic lesion 
scoring in each group indicated that only the last three-
point sacrifices are significantly different from the 
control group.
Kidney
Lesions in the kidney started with congested capillaries 
and cloudy swelling in the epithelium of renal tubules 
after 4 weeks. Tubular epithelial degeneration and 
nuclear pyknosis after 6 weeks. The severity of lesions 
increased with time with the development of glomerular 
atrophy, widening of Bowman’s space with obvious 
degeneration, and sloughing of the lining epithelium of 
tubules, ending up with severe renal tubular necrosis, 
especially in the papillary region after the last sacrifice 
(Fig. 6). Histopathological lesion scoring of all the 
points of sacrifice were significantly different from the 
control group.
Brain
Ischemic neuronal injury, neuronophagia, gliosis, 
and capillary congestion were found in brain tissue, 
especially in the hippocampus region. Lesions begin 
mild in the first sacrifice but as the length of treatment 
increases, the severity of the lesions increases, ending 
with focal malacia after 12 weeks (Fig.7). Lesion 
scoring in all APAP-groups showed statistically 
significant difference from the control group values 
(Fig. 8).

Discussion
When acetaminophen is taken in therapeutic doses, 
80%–90% of it is conjugated with glucuronic acid or 
sulfate and eliminated via the kidneys (McGill and 
Jaeschke, 2013). The cytochrome P450 enzymes react 
with a small amount of the drug, generating the toxic 
metabolite N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) 
(Mazaleuskaya et al., 2015). The resulting metabolite is 
rarely harmful at therapeutic doses since it binds to GSH 
and is eliminated via bile. However, APAP overdosing 
leads to saturation of the other metabolic pathways 
(McGill and Jaeschke, 2013), and NAPQI synthesis 
rises significantly (Xie et al., 2015). NAPQI produced 
in excessive amounts results in a vigorous reaction with 
hepatic GSH reserves and a rapid depletion of GSH. 
This results in free reactive NAPQI that can combine 
with protein sulfhydryl groups to generate APAP 
protein adducts, especially the mitochondrial protein 
(McGill and Jaeschke, 2013). Causing oxidative stress, 
formation of peroxynitrite, mitochondrial membrane 
permeability transition pores, and cellular death 
(Jaeschke et al., 2021). This also explains our results of 
elevated MDA, a sign of oxidative stress, and decreased 
SOD and GSH levels, which are antioxidants, in the 
hepatic, renal, and brain tissues.
APAP has a low (25%) affinity for plasma protein, 
allowing easy distribution of the drug throughout 
the body (Prescott, 1980). Thus, lesions appeared in 
various organs being mild in the liver but increasing in 
severity in the brain, and kidney. 
The toxic effect of the used APAP dose on the liver was 
mild, according to our results. This confirmed the result 
of Venkatesan et al. (2014) using the same dose for 28 
days. This could be explained by one of the following 
hypotheses: prolonged APAP use causes induction of its 
metabolism in the liver by glucuronidation and sulfation

pathways, which are considered defense mechanisms 
(Poulsen and Thomsen, 1988). In addition,  enhanced 
APAP clearance and diminished transport within hepatic 
tissue due to decreased fenestration of endothelial cells 
lining hepatic sinusoids in aged rats (Mitchell et al., 
2011). Another explanation is that mitochondrial protein 
adducts occurring in the liver due to acetaminophen 
toxicity are much fewer in rats than in mice. Therefore, 
rats exhibited lower oxidative damage (McGill et 
al., 2012). However, necrotic changes were found in 
livers of female rats using the same dose for full-term 
pregnancy (20 days) (Neto et al., 2004). This could be 
explained by the faster and more prominent depletion of 
liver GSH during pregnancy (Larrey et al., 1986).
Histopathological examination of the kidneys of 
the APAP group revealed necrotic changes, parallel 
with rising seral urea and creatinine. Renal biopsy is 
rarely done for diagnostic purposes in cases of APAP-
induced nephropathy. However, a moderate overdose 
of paracetamol could result in acute renal dysfunction, 
even without serious hepatic damage (Björck et al., 
1988). Other studies also reported acute renal damage 
(Mazer and Perrone, 2008). The mechanism of renal 
toxicity of paracetamol involves the production of 
NAPQI in the kidney in high amounts, causing GSH 
depletion, and covalently binding to tissue nucleophiles 
(Mudge et al., 1978). However, administration of 
N-acetylcysteine did not affect the peak creatinine level, 
indicating that kidney damage is not just caused by the 
depletion of GSH (Eguia and Materson, 1997). GSH 
conjugates produced by the liver may contribute to the 
renal damage caused by APAP (Trumper et al., 1996). 
APAP can pass through the blood–brain barrier (Mallet 
et al., 2010) resulting in ischemic neuronal injury and

oxidative stress, found in our study, this result agrees 
with a previous finding (Lalert et al., 2020). Lesions 
were very clear and more prominent in the hippocampus 
region of the brain, which is responsible for forming 
new memories, learning, and emotions (Tyng et al., 
2017). The damage to this area of the brain supports the 
results of prior investigations showing that long-term 
paracetamol use has a negative impact on cognition as 
well as memory (Brandlistuen et al., 2013; Blecharz-
Klin et al., 2014) and also decreased empathy (Kandis 
et al., 2018). APAP is known to be a selective COX-
2 inhibitor preventing the formation of prostaglandin 
from arachidonic acid (Hinz et al., 2008), COX-2 is 
mainly concentrated in the hippocampus (Tocco et 
al., 1997). Arachidonic acid metabolites generated by 
COX-2 play an important function in the regulation of 
blood circulation in the brain (Stefanovic et al., 2006). 
Therefore, we can explain the greater harmful effect

of paracetamol in the hippocampus by the increased 
COX-2 level there.
Conclusion
In this study, acetaminophen treatment, even in a 
dose known to be nontoxic, for a long period resulted 
in hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, and brain toxicity. 
Toxicity level increased with Increasing the period of 
treatment. Present results also declare that the liver is 
not the primary organ in APAP toxicity as a mild toxic 
effect was found in the liver but more serious lesions 
and changes in biochemical parameters were found in 
the kidney and brain. 
Conflict of interest
The authors declare that there is no conflict of interest.
