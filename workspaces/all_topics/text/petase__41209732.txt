Enzymatic degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) has dramatically advanced 
through protein engineering of PETase, accelerating the biocatalytic depolymerization 
process. However, the subsequent microbial valorization of PET-derived intermediates, 
such as bis (2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) and terephthalic acid (TPA), remains 
limited because of restricted availability and suboptimal activity of specific biocatalytic 
enzymes. In this study, eight microbial species were isolated from the enriched cultures 
of marine plastic waste, using 1% PET, BHET and TPA as the sole carbon source. 
Stenotrophomonas was the only species detected in all the cultures. Strain WED208 
was isolated from a BHET-enriched culture and selected for its potential role in plastic 
degradation. Phylogenetic analysis based on the 16S rRNA gene revealed 99.4% similarity 
to Stenotrophomonas riyadhensis LMG 33162T; however, it exhibited distinct physiological 
and genomic features. Strain WED208 degraded approximately 30% of BHET into mono 
(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) over 30 days but did not catalyze further conversion 
to TPA. Comparative analysis identified a putative BHETase (WED208_02958) containing 
conserved catalytic residues (Ser90, Asp217, and His245). Structural modeling and protein-
ligand docking analysis confirmed a key interaction between Ser90 and the ester bond 
of BHET, supporting the microbial hydrolytic function. Although strain WED208 could 
degrade neither PET nor TPA, its genome harbored two putative PETase genes and key 
enzymes potentially involved in TPA degradation, including diol dehydrogenase (tphB), 
MFS transporter (pcaK), and LysR-type transcriptional regulator (lysR). These findings 
suggest that WED208 is a promising microbial resource for enzyme engineering and 
has potential use in microbial consortia to enhance PET biodegradation and upcycling.

1 Introduction
Plastics have become essential in modern society owing to their versatility, cost-
effectiveness, and durability. Global production is projected to reach 800 million and 1.6 
billion tons by 2035 and 2050, respectively (Ali et al., 2021). This rapid growth has resulted in 
serious environmental problems, particularly plastic waste accumulation, which threatens 
public health and ecological stability ( Kumar et al., 2021 ; Salinas et al., 2025 ). Therefore, 
innovative and sustainable solutions are urgently required to mitigate the effects of plastic 
pollution. PET is extensively used in automobile tire reinforcement, food packaging, and 
building materials (Kotova et al., 2021). Despite its widespread use, improper disposal and

incineration of PET pose serious environmental and health hazards 
(Baek et al., 2022; Hussain et al., 2023). The growing dependence on 
PET-based products, combined with inappropriate waste management 
systems, has made PET pollution a global concern. Therefore, 
developing sustainable methods for PET degradation or recycling is 
essential to minimize environmental and health impact.
Biodegradation is a promising approach for reducing PET 
pollution. Several microorganisms, including Ideonella sakaiensis, 
Saccharomonospora viridis , Pseudomonas putida,  and 
Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, showed significant PET degradation 
capabilities (Miyakawa et al., 2015; Y oshida et al., 2016; Vague et al., 
2019; Din et al., 2023). These microbes produce enzymes including 
lipases, cutinase, and esterases (Eberl et al., 2009), which catalyze the 
hydrolysis of PET into intermediate compounds such as bis 
(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), mono (2-hydroxyethyl) 
terephthalate (MHET), terephthalic acid (TPA), and ethylene glycol 
(EG) (Kim et al., 2022). Among these, BHET is particularly notable 
because of its structural similarity to PET and its potential role in 
microbial degradation pathways ( Joo et  al., 2018 ). BHET 
biodegradation mechanism study could provide crucial insights into 
understanding its toxicity to humans and environmental impacts. 
Moreover, the use of BHET-degrading microorganisms as whole-cell 
biocatalysts offers several advantages, including the reduction of the 
inhibitory effects on PET hydrolases and minimization of the toxicity 
of degradation byproducts such as TPA ( Qiu et  al., 2020). While 
extensive research has focused on the microbial degradation of PET 
products, such as TPA and EG, few studies have explored 
microorganisms capable of utilizing BHET as the sole carbon source, 
which could contribute to the improvement of 
bioremediation strategies.
Plastispheres have been extensively investigated as novel 
bioresources for the biodegradation of plastic. Over extended periods, 
microbial consortia naturally attach to plastic debris in the 
environment and in adhesion, biodeterioration, biofragmentation, 
assimilation, and mineralization. NGS technology allows us to 
understand the distinct dominant taxa between the plastisphere and 
normal microbial habitats (Li et al., 2024). Based on these findings, 
co-cultures of plastic-degrading or associated microbes have been 
used to enhance plastic biodegradation and upcycling. For instance, 
Schaerer et al. identified Hydrogenophaga as an aromatic compound 
degrader and Paracoccus as a specialist in terephthalamide degradation 
using metagenomic and metatranscriptomic approaches (Schaerer 
et al., 2023). Furthermore, integrating mixed microbial consortia with 
pretreatment processes improves the biodegradation efficiency of 
polyolefin plastics (Lomwongsopon et al., 2025).
In this study, we aimed to isolate plastic-associated bacteria 
from the marine plastisphere (specifically from waste plastics 
collected from the coast) and investigate their potential roles in 
plastic degradation through substrate assimilation experiments. 
We  further explored the taxonomic position of the selected 
isolate based on its physiological and genomic characteristics 
and identified key enzymes involved in plastic biodegradation 
using comprehensive genomic analysis, structural modeling, 
and protein-ligand docking analysis. Eight distinct bacterial 
species were isolated from marine plastic waste, and 
Stenotrophomonas  sp. WED208 was selected for its potential role 
in the degradation of PET and its intermediates, BHET and 
TPA, respectively. This study proposes strain WED208 as a 
promising microbial resource for sustainable plastic waste 
management, with potential applications in enhancing 
enzymatic efficiency through protein engineering and 
elucidating the regulatory mechanisms underlying plastic 
degradation pathways.
2 Materials and methods
2.1 Strains and culturing conditions
To explore the microorganisms that decompose marine 
microplastics, 63 pieces of plastic waste (plastic bottles, caps, straws, 
and plastic films) that were either discarded or partially buried in 
sediment or among rocks were collected from eight shoreline locations 
around Jeju Island. The collected samples were stored at 4 °C and 
transferred to the laboratory for analysis. For plastic waste-associated 
bacterial isolation, plastic samples were initially enriched in R2A 
broth medium for 1 week. The enriched cultures were subsequently 
inoculated into a modified R2A medium (lacking glucose and starch) 
supplemented with 1% (w/v) plastic powder (PET, BHET, or TPA) and 
incubated for 4 weeks. PET powder (100–200 um) was prepared by 
Dr. Jeong (KRIBB, Korea) and BHET and TPA were purchased from 
Sigma-Aldrich (United States). Finally, the cultures were spread onto 
R2A agar plates to isolate individual bacterial colonies 
(Supplementary Figure S1). The isolates were stored in a 20% v/v 
glycerol solution at −80 °C.
2.2 16S rRNA gene sequencing and 
phylogenetic analysis
A partial 16S rRNA sequence of the strain was amplified 
using the universal primers 27F and 1492R for phylogenetic 
analysis ( Jin et al., 2022 ). The 16S rRNA sequences of closely 
related microbes were retrieved from the EzBioCloud database. 1 
A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbor-joining 
method with the Kimura 2-parameter model ( Tamura et al., 
2021 ) in MEGA 11.
2.3 Phenotypic and physiological 
characterization
R2A medium was used to assess the morphological, 
physiological, and biochemical characteristics of the strain. 
Growth was evaluated at different temperatures (4–45 °C), salt 
concentration [0–12% (w/v) NaCl], and pH values (4–12) for 
3–5 days under aerobic conditions. Antibiotic susceptibility 
assays were performed using filter paper disks containing 14 
different antibiotics ( Table  1 ). Additional physiological 
characteristics were determined using API 20NE and API ZYM 
(bioMérieux) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

2.4 Whole-genome sequencing and 
assembly
A genome sequencing library was prepared using the TruSeq 
Nano DNA Kit, generating paired-end reads of 2 × 151 bp and was 
sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Raw sequence 
data were quality-checked using FastQC v. 0.11.5, 2 and adapter 
sequences and low-quality reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic 
v0.36 (Bolger et al., 2014). Quality-filtered reads were assembled de 
novo using SPAdes v3.15.0 (Bankevich et al., 2012). Assembly quality 
was evaluated using BUSCO v5.1.3 ( Simão et  al., 2015). Genome 
coverage and size were estimated using Jellyfish v2.2.10 (Marçais and 
Kingsford, 2011) and GenomeScope (Vurture et al., 2017). Predicted 
coding sequences (CDS) were identified using Prodigal, and 
functional annotation was perfomred using Prokka (Seemann, 2014). 
BLAST3 was used for genome sequence comparisons.
2.5 Genome annotation and comparative 
study
Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology (RAST) and the 
evolutionary genealogy of genes (EggNOG) were used for gene 
prediction (Brettin et al., 2015). PlasticDB (V7.0) was used to identify 
the proteins associated with plastic biodegradation (Blin et al., 2023). 
A phylogenomic tree was constructed using the Genome BLAST 
Distance Phylogeny method on the TYGS platform (Meier-Kolthoff  
and Göker, 2019) and visualized using the web-based software iTOL 
v7.4 The Bacterial and Viral Bioinformatics Resource Centers 
(BV-BRC) were analyzed using the default settings. Antibiotic-
resistance genes were identified using the Comprehensive Antibiotic 
Resistance Database.5 Circular genome maps were generated using 
Proksee6 (Grant et al., 2023).
Genomic data were obtained from the National Center for 
Biotechnology Information (NCBI), and the accession numbers are 
listed in Supplementary Table S1. For the pan-genome analysis, eight 
strains closely related to strain WED208 were selected using the Anvi’ o 
8 pan-genomic workflow (Delmont and Eren, 2018; Eren et al., 2020). 
Genes were clustered in Anvi’ o using BLASTP from NCBI with the 
default settings.
2.6 BHET degradation assay
The culture medium was R2A broth supplemented with 1% (w/v) 
BHET powder. After thorough mixing, the culture medium was 
inoculated with a 1% (v/v) bacterial solution (A 600 = 0.4). All 
experimental samples were prepared in triplicates, along with three 
negative controls that did not contain bacteria. The cultures were 
incubated at 28 °C for 30 days, and bacterial growth (A600) and pH 
were measured every day. The culture solution was collected every 5 
days, and the supernatant was concentrated. Methanol was added to 
prepare a 1 mg/mL solution, and the degradation activity was analyzed 
by HPLC after filtration through 0.20 μm.
HPLC analysis was performed using an Agilent Technologies 
1260 Series system equipped with an AccucoreTM XL C18 
(4.6 × 250 mm 4 μm) column (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA,

United States). The mobile phase consisted of 50 mM PBS (solvent A) 
and methanol (solvent B) at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min and a column 
temperature of 40 °C. The gradient was set as follows (all percentages 
were v/v): starting with 80% solvent A and changing to 60% solvent A 
at 12 min. The injection volume was 10 μL. Pure BHET, MHET, and 
TPA solutions (dissolved in methanol) were used as references.
2.7 Homology alignment and docking
Potential homologous hydrolases of LCC, TfCut2, PET40, 
IsPETase, TfH, and ScLipA were identified by performing BLASTp 
search of the strain WED208 genome using the default settings. The 
hits were ranked based on the BLAST score, query cover, percent 
identity, and the presence of the catalytic triad and substrate-binding 
site. The similarity of the protease genes between strain WED208 and 
the other strains was compared with the gene sequences in the 
NCBI database.
The 3D structure of WED208_MEX5405504.1 was predicted 
using AlphaFold 3, supported by the AlphaFold Server (Abramson 
et  al., 2024). Molecular docking was performed with SwissDock 
(Eberhardt et al., 2021; Bugnon et al., 2024), and model visualization 
and editing were conducted using ChimeraX 1.8 (Meng et al., 2023).
2.8 TPA transporter proteins
To predict the distribution of TPA transporters in the strain 
WED208, we  constructed a database of homologous proteins from 
public sources and aligned the WED208 coding sequence (CDS) with it 
to identify candidate transporters. For efficient and accurate sequence 
alignment, we used the command-line version of Diamond, which is 
known for its speed and precision (Buchfink et al., 2021). The following 
parameters were set during the alignment: the expected cutoff value (E 
value) was 10−5 to ensure significant results, a minimum alignment 
length of 30 amino acids to ensure reliability, and a minimum similarity 
percentage of 50% to ensure sufficient homology among aligned proteins.
3 Results
3.1 Phylogenetic and physiological 
characterization
More than 25 distinct colonies were selected based on their 
morphological characteristics and identified by 16 s rRNA sequencing. 
These isolates belonged to four genus, Stenotrophomonas, Bacillus, 
Pseudomonas, and Raoultella, with S. riyadhensis being consistently 
enriched across all substrates. Among the identified species, 
Stenotrophomonas was the only genus found in all enrichment cultures, 
suggesting its potential as a unique candidate for further studies on the 
biodegradation of PET and its intermediates. Although nine strains 
belonged to the genus Stenotrophomonas, they shared identical 16 s 
rRNA sequences. Consequently, strain WED208, isolated from the 
BHET enrichment culture, was selected for further analysis.
The 16S rRNA gene sequence of strain WED208 was uploaded to 
the EzBioCloud database for comparison. It exhibited the highest 
identity to S. riyadhensis LMG 33162 T (99.82%), S. pavanii DSM 
25135T (99.36%), and S. geniculata ATCC 19374T (99.36%), followed 
by S. maltophilia KACC 11358T (99.29%) and S. hibiscicola ATCC 
19867T (99.15%) ( Figure  1A ). Despite its close phylogenetic 
relationship with Stenotrophomonas species, strain WED208 displayed 
distinct genotypic characteristics, including genome size, variation in 
the number of annotated genes, and the number and distribution of 
accessory and singleton genes.
Cells of strain WED208 were non-spore-forming, rod-shaped, 
Gram-negative, and measured 1.3 × 0.6 μm (Figure 1B). After 3 days of 
cultivation at 28 °C, the strain formed pale yellow, smooth, glossy, and 
spherical colonies on the medium. The phenotypic and physiological 
characteristics of strain WED208 are summarized in Table 1.
3.2 Genomic features
Strain WED208 possessed a 4,637,711 bp circular chromosome 
with a GC content of 66.5%. Genes were identified through genome 
annotation using Prokka, including 4,176 protein-coding genes 
(CDSs), 73 tRNA genes, 3 rRNA genes, and 1 tmRNA gene 
(Supplementary Table S1). A circular genome map was generated 
using the Proksee Server to illustrate the distribution of these genome 
annotations (Figure 1C). Functional annotation of strain WED208 
was performed using RAST and EggNOG, and the results showed that 
the strain contained 305 subsystems across 24 functional categories 
(1,479 genes) and 22 functional clusters (2,998 genes; 
Supplementary Figure S2). Notably, WED208 contained 23 and 146 
genes associated with aromatic compound metabolism and membrane 
transport, respectively. Several candidate enzymes with potential 
plastic degradation activity were identified, including 32 esterases, 6 
lipases, and 13 α/β-hydrolases involved in ester bond hydrolysis.
The taxonomic position of strain WED208 within the genus 
Stenotrophomonas was also confirmed through phylogenomic analysis 
with other 31 Stenotrophomonas species. Figure 2A summarizes the 
genome size, gene count, and GC content of Stenotrophomonas 
species. A comprehensive pan-genomic analysis of nine strains within 
the clade revealed 7,385 gene clusters (37,855 genes), including 2,676 
core gene clusters, 2,339 accessory gene clusters, and 2,370 singleton 
gene clusters (Supplementary Figure S3). Although strain WED208 
shares the conserved functional backbone of the genus, its unique 
accessory and singleton genes may provide adaptive advantages and 
novel metabolic pathways, making it a promising candidate for further 
investigation into biodegradation and environmental biotechnology 
applications. Analysis of antibiotic resistance genes in strain WED208 
was summarized in Supplementary Tables S1, S2  that revealed 
multiple resistance-related genes and their respective mechanisms 
(Garneau-Tsodikova and Labby, 2016).
3.3 Biodegradation of BHET and TPA
Biodegradation activity was assessed by analyzing the degraded 
intermediates. Although Stenotrophomonas was initially isolated from 
enrichment cultures containing PET, BHET, or TPA, strain WED208 only 
degraded BHET. No intermediates (BHET, MHET, and TPA) were detected 
in the PET culture, and no reduction in TPA was observed in the TPA 
culture. In contrast, in the BHET culture, BHET levels decreased, whereas 
MHET levels increased (Supplementary Figure S4).
Zhuo et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2025.1680692
Frontiers in Microbiology 05 frontiersin.org
Growth was monitored for 30 days by measuring OD and pH daily. 
BHET degradation was analyzed using HPLC on days 5, 10, 15, and 30. 
Although the initial growth rate was low, it progressively increased over 
time, with BHET conversion closely correlated with cell growth 
(Supplementary Figure S5). In the strain WED208 cultures, BHET 
degradation primarily led to MHET accumulation rather than

TPA. The BHET reduction increased gradually, reaching approximately 
30% by day 30 (Figure 3). Some BHET degradation was also observed 
in the control, likely due to the instability caused by UV sterilization 
before cultivation. However, the BHET reduction in the strain 
WED208 culture was significantly higher than that in the control. No 
TPA accumulation was detected, indicating that the strain WED208 
hydrolyzed BHET to MHET but did not further degrade MHET to TPA.
3.4 Identification of potential BHETase and 
TPAase
Plastic degradation genes in the whole-genome sequence of strain 
WED208 were investigated using PlasticDB. The strain WED208 
harbors several enzymes potentially involved in degrading various 
plastics, including PET, PBAT, PHBV , PHA, PLA, PEG, and PHB 
(Figure  2B). These enzymes include PETases, esterases, lipases, 
proteases, carboxylesterases, dehydrogenases, and depolymerases. 
During PET degradation, these enzymes typically catalyze the 
hydrolysis of ester bonds, breaking PET into smaller molecules, such 
as BHET and TPA, which are more readily assimilated by 
microorganisms (Lu et  al., 2022). Although WED208_00500 and 
WED208_02014 were annotated as esterase and PETase and linked to 
PET degradation, no degradation products were observed in cultures 
containing 1% PET powder, suggesting that these enzymes may 
require specific conditions or cofactors for activation.
To explore the potential role of the strain WED208  in BHET 
metabolism, a Protein BLAST search was conducted using several 
BHETases/PETase enzymes, such as LCC, TfCut2, TfH, PET40, 
IsPETase, and ScLipA. WED208_MEX5405504.1 retains conserved 
functional domains essential for BHET hydrolysis. Sequence 
alignment ( Figure  4A) revealed a low overall similarity between 
WED208_MEX5405504.1 and the six BHETase/PETase enzymes, 
attributed to insertions (positions 109–177) and deletions (positions 
1–29). These structural differences may explain the variations in the 
sequence profiles. Despite these variations, WED208_MEX5405504.1 
retained the key residues essential for BHETase activity. The catalytic 
triad, consisting of serine (Ser90), aspartate (Asp217), and histidine 
(His245), is crucial for hydrolyzing the ester bond in 
BHET. Tryptophan (Trp184), a binding-site residue involved in 
substrate recognition, is also conserved. These findings suggest that 
WED208_MEX5405504.1 possesses BHETase activity and may 
contribute to the BHET metabolism.
To further investigate the functional conservation of WED208_
MEX5405504.1, a protein docking analysis (Figure 4B) was performed 
using BHET as the ligand. The analysis revealed that BHET binds to the 
active site of WED208_MEX5405504.1, where ten amino acid residues 
interact with it. Notably, Ser90 interacted with one of the ester bonds of 
BHET, thereby facilitating its hydrolysis. This supports the known 
catalytic mechanism of BHETase, in which the active-site serine acts as 
a nucleophile to cleave the ester bond, leading to BHET degradation.
4 Discussion
The genus Stenotrophomonas is widely recognized for its role in 
bioremediation, particularly in the degradation of various pollutants, 
including xenobiotics, oils, dyes, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons 
(Coleman et al., 2002; Arulazhagan et al., 2017; Alvarado-Gutiérrez 
et  al., 2020 ). Recently, the plastic-degrading potential of 
Stenotrophomonas species has garnered increasing attention. These 
bacteria secrete enzymes, such as esterases and lipases, which break 
down plastic polymers into smaller, more biodegradable molecules 
(Table 1). S. maltophilia reportedly degrades PET plastics down to 
TPA, BHET, and MHET using cutinase-like enzymes ( Din et  al., 
2023). Furthermore, Stenotrophomonas strains can degrade 
polyethylene and polystyrene using multiple enzymes (Peixoto et al., 
2017; Xiang et  al., 2023 ). This study demonstrated the ability of 
Stenotrophomonas to degrade BHET, providing complementary 
information on its known degradation capabilities.

Zhuo et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2025.1680692
Frontiers in Microbiology 07 frontiersin.org
Strain WED208, isolated from waste plastics collected from 
the seashore, could utilize BHET as the sole carbon source and 
convert it into MHET. Genomic analysis revealed the presence of 
a potential BHET-degrading enzyme, WED208_MEX5405504.1, 
a putative BHETase. Sequence conservation analysis and protein-
ligand docking identified conserved catalytic residues (Ser90, 
Asp216, and His245), and Ser90 was found to interact with the 
ester bond of BHET. This is consistent with the typical serine 
hydrolase mechanism, in which serine acts as a nucleophile and 
histidine functions as a general acid/base, supported by aspartate. 
Despite sequence variations compared to several BHETase/
PETase enzymes, WED208_MEX5405504.1 retained the essential 
active site residues. However, its binding affinity for BHET 
(−5.771 kcal/mol) is weaker than those of proteins with higher 
affinities ( −6 to −8 kcal/mol), suggesting a reduced catalytic 
efficiency ( Hong et  al., 2024 ; Longarini and Matić, 2024 ). A 
stronger binding affinity typically correlates with a higher 
catalytic activity ( Hong et al., 2024 ). These findings suggest that 
the lower binding affinity of the enzyme may limit its efficiency 
in BHET degradation. Recent advances in mechanism-guided 
enzyme engineering, such as modifications to the barrier regions 
of two BHETases, ChryBHETase and BsEst, have enhanced BHET 
accessibility and catalytic efficiency by optimizing key structural 
parameters using docking analysis ( Li et al., 2023 ). The optimized 
variants, ΔBsEst and ΔChryBHETase, in which the barrier 
regions were removed and the top-scoring modifications were 
selected, exhibited a 3.5-fold increase in their catalytic efficiency. 
Applying similar engineering strategies to WED208_
MEX5405504.1 may improve its catalytic activity by enhancing 
its interaction with BHET.
TPA, an aromatic compound derived from PET, must 
be completely degraded to achieve effective PET depolymerization and 
valorization. TPA is converted to protocatechuate (PCA) via DCD, 
catalyzed by tphA1A2A3 and tphB, and subsequently funneled into 
central metabolism for the production of value-added compounds, 
such as muconic acid, vanillic acid and pyrogallol (Kim et al., 2019). To 
explore this pathway in strain WED208, a comparative genomic 
analysis with related Stenotrophomonas species was conducted 
(Figure 5). tphB was conserved across all strains except S. koreensis 
KCTC 12211, whereas tphA was present only in S. humi DSM 18929. 
The lysR gene, a LysR-type regulator frequently associated with TPA 
clusters, was identified in all strains except S. terrae DSM 18941. 
Notably, only 10 strains, including strain WED208, carried tphK, a 
homolog of pcaK that encodes a p-hydroxybenzoic acid transporter 
involved in the uptake of aromatic compounds (Nichols and Harwood, 
1997). In WED208, tphK is located within the predicted TPA cluster 
and encodes a major facilitator superfamily (MFS) transporter, 
consistent with MFS-type TPA transporters in Rhodococcus sp. and 
Paraburkholderia xenovorans. In contrast, Comamonas sp. employs a 
tripartite tricarboxylate transporter (TTT; tphC–tpiAB) that is 
positioned separately from the TPA operon ( Hosaka et  al., 2013; 
Y oshida et al., 2016; Gautom et al., 2021). These observations suggest 
that tphK in WED208 may function as a transporter of TPA and 
related aromatics.
Although strain WED208 lacks tphA and cannot complete TPA 
degradation, its accessory genes (tphB, tphK, and lysR) remain valuable 
for PET upcycling strategies. For instance, Werner et  al. (2021)  
engineered Pseudomonas putida to convert TPA to β-ketoadipic acid 
by introducing tphAB from Comamonas camanonas and tphK from 
Rhodococcus jostii, while deleting pcaiJ, which encodes 3-oxoadipate

CoA-transferase. Furthermore, identifying new TPA transporters or 
mechanisms is crucial for advancing microbial engineering in PET 
upcycling. The muconate transporter MucK in Acinetobacter baylyi 
ADP1 has been proposed to facilitate TPA import, potentially 
functioning similarly to TphK (Pardo et al., 2020). Further functional 
studies of tphK in the strain WED208 could expand its application in 
engineering microbes for PET bioconversion. Based on genomic 
predictions, the proposed BHET/PET degradation pathway for the 
strain WED208 is illustrated in Figure 6.
This study provides valuable insights into the molecular mechanisms 
underlying BHET degradation by Stenotrophomonas sp. WED208, 
providing a foundation for future research on its application in plastic 
biodegradation and upcycling. Although BHET biodegradation by the 
strain WED208 was slow and incomplete, these limitations could

be improved through microbial consortia, which synergistically degrade 
plastics. Notably, eight other species were isolated from the enriched 
cultures derived from the same marine plastic waste samples. These isolates 
highlight the potential for developing microbial consortia for PET 
degradation. Recent research has focused on constructing plastisphere 
microbial communities to enhance the natural degradation of banned 
microplastics for bioremediation. Even if individual microbes lack enzymes 
associated with PET degradation, microbial consortia can compensate for 
these deficiencies by supporting the metabolic functions of each other, 
leading to enhanced degradation through synergistic interactions. Further 
studies are required to explore the relationship between the isolated strains 
and their collective potential for PET biodegradation. In parallel, enhancing 
the enzymatic activity of key-degrading enzymes through protein 
engineering and exploring the regulatory mechanisms controlling these 
metabolic pathways are crucial. Integrating these insights with synthetic 
biology strategies may contribute to a sustainable approach to plastic 
waste management.
