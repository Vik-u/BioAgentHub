Abstract
Zieve’s syndrome is an underdiagnosed condition characterized by the triad of jaundice, hemolytic anemia,
and hyperlipidemia in the setting of chronic alcohol use. It may be accompanied by acute alcoholic hepatitis.
The distinction between the coexistence of acute alcoholic hepatitis with Zieve’s syndrome and Zieve's
syndrome in isolation is crucial, given the different treatments and prognoses in these situations.
A 35-year-old woman presented with complaints of abdominal discomfort, nausea, and vomiting in the
previous week. She was a heavy drinker with resultant cirrhosis, splenomegaly, and esophageal varices. An
ancillary test showed hemolytic anemia, moderately elevated transaminases, hyperbilirubinemia, and
coagulopathy. A negative direct Coombs test established the anemia as non-immune, supporting the
diagnosis of Zieve’s syndrome despite the absence of hyperlipidemia. Maddrey’s discriminant function score
was 92 points, so she was treated with supportive measures, as well as corticosteroids in the setting of acute
alcoholic hepatitis. The patient showed a favorable clinical and analytical evolution and was discharged
home one month following admission with her hemoglobin levels stabilized.
Previous literature focused on the distinction between Zieve's syndrome and acute alcoholic hepatitis but
they may coexist.

Introduction
First described in 1958 by Dr. Leslie Zieve, Zieve’s syndrome presents as a triad of hemolytic anemia,
jaundice, and transient hyperlipidemia that develops secondary to alcohol-induced liver injury 
[1]
. It is
underdiagnosed probably due to the lack of awareness within the medical community. Therefore, its true
prevalence is unknown 
[2]
.
Probably due to its transient nature, hyperlipidemia is not apparent at the time of diagnosis in some patients
[1]
.
Anemia is a common finding in alcoholic liver disease and can be explained by nutritional deficits, medullary
alcohol toxicity, chronic inflammation, hypersplenism, or hemolysis in the context of Zieve’s syndrome 
[2]
.
The pathogenesis of Zieve’s syndrome remains poorly understood 
[2]
. Abstention from alcohol and
supportive management are the basis of its treatment 
[2]
.
Jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia are common findings in both Zieve's syndrome and acute alcoholic
hepatitis 
[2]
. Previous literature focused on the distinction between these two entities 
[2]
 but they may
coexist.
Case Presentation
A 35-year-old Caucasian woman with a history of chronic alcohol abuse with resultant cirrhosis and portal
hypertension manifestations (small esophageal varices and splenomegaly) sought medical attention at the
emergency service with complaints of an increased abdominal perimeter with diffuse abdominal pain,
nausea, and vomiting for one week prior to admission. She denied fever, diaphoresis, and gastrointestinal
blood loss and was medicated with propranolol, spironolactone, and lactulose. The patient had been
evaluated three months earlier in the outpatient clinic, and ascites was not present. Bilirubin levels were
3.79 mg/dL, with hemoglobin of 10.5 g/dL and platelet count of 102 per uL.
She admitted to drinking alcohol in the days before coming to the hospital. Physical examination revealed
blood pressure of 118/68 mmHg, tympanic pressure of 37ºC, generalized jaundice, moderate volume ascites,
mild edema of the lower limbs, and signs of minimal encephalopathy with an abnormal retain test. A digital
rectal exam was not suggestive of digestive blood loss. The chest radiograph and electrocardiogram were
unremarkable. The abdominal ultrasound with Doppler excluded portal vein thrombosis, dilation of the intra

and extrahepatic bile ducts, and focal lesions. Cytological and microbiological evaluation of ascitic fluid
ruled out spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.
A complete blood count revealed severe anemia with a hemoglobin value of 6 g/dL. Lactate dehydrogenase
was increased, and the haptoglobin level was untraceable. The peripheral blood smear showed schistocytes
and acanthocytes (Figure 
1
), and the direct Combs test was negative. The lipid panel and pancreatic enzymes
were normal. Prolonged prothrombin time was also detected. Other notable laboratory studies on admission
are summarized in Table

 1: Laboratory studies on admission.
An initial concern about the possibility of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura was raised based on the
fact that this patient was a young woman with hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neurological
abnormalities but the patient had a low PLASMIC score (three points), and later ADAMTS13 activity testing
ruled out the diagnosis. She was diagnosed with Zieve’s syndrome in the setting of an acute-on-chronic liver
failure triggered by acute alcoholic hepatitis (Maddrey discriminant function score of 92 points and Model
for End-Stage Liver Disease-Na score of 32 points). She started supportive treatment (blood transfusion,
vitamin supplements, diuretics, and prevention of alcohol withdrawal) and a four-week course of
prednisolone targeting alcoholic hepatitis. The patient’s symptoms improved slowly. Her hemoglobin levels
remained stable with a subsequent decrease in bilirubin levels and normalization of renal function. She was
discharged home one month after admission with subsequent follow-up as an out-patient.
Discussion
Zieve’s syndrome’s essential clinical features are jaundice, hyperlipidemia, and hemolytic anemia. This
illness follows excessive drinking and improves once the drinking stops 
[1]
. Although it is a rare disease,
some studies estimate its frequency in a general medical ward to be one in 1600 admissions 
[3]
.
The pathogenesis of this syndrome has yet to be fully understood. It is hypothesized that hyperlipidemia
results from a massive fat mobilization to or from the liver 
[1]
 and that high levels of lysolecithin and
lysocephalin could trigger erythrocyte destruction 
[4]
. It was also shown that alcohol-induced vitamin E
deficiency of erythrocytes leads to a decrease in membrane-bound polyunsaturated fatty acid, which may

destabilize pyruvate kinase and increase the susceptibility to hemolysis 
[5]
. Jaundice and hyperbilirubinemia
seem to result from hemolysis and mostly from alcohol-induced intrahepatic cholestasis.
There are few reports referring to the coexistence of Zieve’s syndrome and acute alcoholic hepatitis 
[6,7]
.
This difference is critical to notice since the two illnesses have different prognoses: most patients with
Zieve’s syndrome will recover four to six weeks after alcohol withdrawal, while a significant percentage of
patients with acute alcoholic hepatitis may progress to liver failure and death and may benefit from
treatment with corticosteroids. The distinction is not always easy, since both diseases can lead to high
bilirubin levels (mainly direct bilirubin). Hyperbilirubinemia secondary to hemolysis may misguide clinicians
to overtreat with steroids based on a high Maddrey’s discriminant function score leading to an increased risk
of infection. Thus, it is important to weigh the impact of this score's parameters (hyperbilirubinemia and
coagulopathy) on the final value. In the present case, the patient had severe coagulopathy that justified
treatment with steroids.
This patient presented with moderately elevated transaminases, an aspartate aminotransferase/alanine
aminotransferase ratio of more than 2, direct bilirubin higher than 6 mg/dL, and coagulopathy in the
presence of a long history of heavy alcohol use and a very high value of Maddrey score, so it was assumed
she had acute alcoholic hepatitis. The finding of anemia associated with low haptoglobin levels, high lactate
dehydrogenase levels, and schistocytes in the peripheral blood smear led to the diagnosis of hemolytic
anemia. A negative direct Coombs test and the latter ADAMTS13 activity test raised suspicion of Zieve’s
syndrome. The patient presented with normal cholesterol and triglycerides serum levels. As stated before,
hyperlipidemia is one of the features of this syndrome. However, half of the patients with Zieve’s syndrome
have been found to have no lipemia 
[1]
. This may be because the rise in serum lipids is transient and often
precedes the onset of hemolysis 
[6]
. Additionally, this rise appears less extensive in patients with more
advanced cirrhosis 
[1]
, as with this patient. There have been other recent cases reported with normal lipid
profiles 
[8]
.
Despite the absence of hyperlipidemia and the presence of a concomitant cause of hyperbilirubinemia, the
patient was diagnosed with Zieve’s syndrome in the setting of non-immune hemolytic anemia and recent
alcohol abuse.
There is no specific treatment for Zieve’s syndrome. Supportive care remains the standard therapy, and
recovery within four to six weeks following alcohol cessation is documented in case reports 
[7]
.
Conclusions
The presence of hemolysis in patients with alcohol-induced liver injury should raise suspicion for Zieve’s
syndrome. Hyperlipidemia is one of the typical features of this syndrome but it may be transient and not
apparent at the time of diagnosis. Its absence should not exclude the diagnosis in the right clinical setting.
Previous literature focused on the distinction between Zieve's syndrome and acute alcoholic hepatitis but
they may coexist. This case report exemplifies that occurrence.
