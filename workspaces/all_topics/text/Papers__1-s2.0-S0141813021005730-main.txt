Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) biodegra-
dation
IsPETase (PETase fromIdeonella Sakaiensis)
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is used widely by human beings, but is very difﬁcult to degrade. Up to now,
the PET degradation effect of PETase fromIdeonella sakaiensis201-F6 (IsPETase) variants with low stability and
activity was not ideal. In this study, a mutation design tool, Premuse, was developed to integrate the sequence
alignment and quantitative selection of the preferred mutations based on natural sequence evolution. Ten single
point mutants were selected from 1486 homologous sequences using Premuse, and then two mutations (W159H
and F229Y) with improved stability were screened from them. The derived double point mutant, W159H/F229Y,
exhibited a strikingly enhanced enzymatic performance. ItsT
m and catalytic efﬁciency values (kcat/Km)r e s p e c -
tively increased by 10.4 °C and 2.0-fold using p-NPP as the substrate compared with wild type. The degradation
activity for amorphous PET was increased by almost 40-fold in comparison with wild type at 40 °C in 24 h. Addi-
tionally, the variant could catalyze biodegradation of PET bottle preform at a mean rate of 23.4 mgPET/h/mgenzyme.
This study allowed us to design the mutation more efﬁciently, and provides a tool for achieving biodegradation of
PET pollution under mild natural environments.

1. Introduction
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is one of the most widely
distributed synthetic plastic pollutants worldwide, due to its desirable
properties of durability, low-cost, massive yield and heavy usage [1].
Human-made PET has been present in the ecosystem for over
100 years [2], and is a burgeoning threat because of accelerated produc-
tion [3–6]. Micro- and nanoplastics have been reported as present in an-
imals and food products, meaning they are part of human food chains
[7,8], and potentially threaten human health [9]. The presence of PET
in ecosystems has provided a long time for decomposers in the bio-
sphere to evolve to access PET as a novel carbon source. PET can also
be depolymerized by several other cutinase enzymes. However, PET
biodegradation catalyzed by these natural enzymes is inefﬁcient and
time-consuming [6,10–13]. Therefore, engineering of these PETases is
an important issue.
Not content with the evolutionary speed of natural enzymes, several
groups have worked on engineering PETases. One potential solution for
this problem is the enhancement of operational temperatures of
thermophilic PETases close to the PET glass transition temperature
(~76 °C) [14,15]. Tournier et al. succeeded in creating an ICCG variant
of LCC by saturation mutagenesis, by increasing the operational temper-
atures from 65 °C to 72 °C, so that it could break down PET bottle pre-
forms [16]. Although this kind of approach provides a solution for
industrialized PET recycling, it is of limited help for environmental engi-
neering bacteria construction under mild environmental temperatures.
However, the PETase produced by a strain of Ideonella sakaiensis
(IsPETase) identiﬁed by Yoshida et al. [17] can degrade PET at ambient
conditions. The engineering ofIsPETase can address this problem, and
several groups have reported research advances. For example, Kim's
group introduced S121E/D186H/R280A intoIsPETase, increasing the op-
erational temperature of the variant by 10 °C and resulting in 14-fold
higher PET degradation at 40 °C than the wild type [18]. IsPETase, how-
ever, exhibits poor durability, and most of its variants can only catalyze
amorphous PET biodegradation with slightly higher enzyme activity
[18–21].
Consensus protein design is a popular semi-rational design strategy
for protein stability. It is based on the hypothesis that the respective
consensus amino acids contribute more than the non-conserved
amino acids at a speciﬁc position to the stability of the protein. The con-
sensus design approach has been widely successful in improving the
stabilities of proteins, resulting in melting temperatures increased by

10–32 °C in some proteins [22]. However, the key step of the method,
creating a good multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of the sequences,
is a major computational challenge especially in large, diverse sequence
datasets. In addition, the numerous columns in the MSA make it difﬁcult
to select the potential mutations, and mutation design using the method
is generally considered more art than science [22–24].
With the arrival of big-data and expanded sample size, large num-
bers of genes have been sequenced from diverse environments and de-
posited in public databases. Multiple homologs (>1000) of most
proteins can thus be easily acquired. Sequences from big-data provide
us a new way to analyze residue evolution and its effect on protein
structure and function. A standardized method is needed to deal with
such big-data and mine the useful mutants from this naturally evolved
sequence pool.
In this study, a web tool (Premuse,http://www.elabcaas.cn/pird/
premuse.html) was developed to predict mutations based on natural
sequence evolution. Pairwise alignment was employed to construct
the ideal alignment and avoid the calculations required for MSA. The
calculated position-speciﬁc amino acid probabilities (PSAP) were used
to quantitatively select the preferred mutations. A series of evaluation
criteria was introduced to establish a procedure and applied to the en-
zyme IsPETase. The W159H/F229Y derived from Premuse exhibited ex-
cellent enzymatic properties. Its melting temperature increased by
10.4 °C, and its value ofkcat/Km and half-life were respectively twice
and three times as much as that of wild type. As a result, the variant
could catalyze biodegradation of PET bottle preform in 24 to 72 h, at a
mean rate of 23.4 mgPET/h/mgenzyme, and it outperformed most of the
other variants ofIsPETase reported so far, which could only depolymer-
ize amorphous or low-crystalline PET.
W159H/F229Y was screened from only ten alternative variants. The
excellent success rate was because the strategy took full advantage of
evolutionary information contained in homologous protein sequences
[22]. Premuse could be an exquisite and efﬁcient option for protein en-
gineering with a high success rate but a low workload.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Computational design of IsPETase by Premuse
The sequence information of poly(ethylene terephthalate) hydro-
lases (PETase)IsPETase (Accession NO: 6EQD_A) and its 1486 homologs
(identity >45%, coverage >50%) were acquired from databases of NCBI.
The pairwise alignment tool, needle in EMBoss [25], was used to carry
out the sequence alignment between the target sequence and each of
the similar proteins. All of the homologs were trimmed to the same
length as and aligned to the target sequence. Then the aligned homologs
were weighted and the position-speciﬁc amino acid probabilities
(PSAP) of the target sequence were calculated [26]. If the evolutionary
selection probability of the mutation was greater than 65% of the prob-
ability of the wild type, the amino acids were selected for the variant's
construction. The above mutation selection protocol was integrated as
a web tool, Premuse (Premuse,http://www.elabcaas.cn/pird/premuse.
html), to design the potential mutations.
2.2. Plasmids construction
The nucleotide sequences encoding signal peptides predicted with
SignalP [27]( http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/SignalP/) were removed.
Then the gene encodingIsPETase was commercially synthesized with
codon optimization by GenScript Co. Ltd. (Nanjing, China) and cloned
into theHindIII andNcoIs i t e so fp E T - 2 7 b .
2.3. Variant construction
The single point mutations were cloned intoIsPETase by amplifying
full-length plasmid using Phanta Max Super-Fidelity DNA Polymerase
(Vazyme, Nanjing, China) with partially overlapping oligonucleotides.
The product of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was circularized by ho-
mologous recombination using ClonExpress II One Step Cloning Kit
(Vazyme, Nanjing, China) and transformed inE. coliBL21 (DE3). The
DNA sequencing of variants was carried out by TSINGKE Co. Ltd. (Bei-
jing, China). The sequences ofIsPETase andIsPETase
W159H/F229Y were
also cloned into theHindIII andNcoI sites of pET-30a for large scale pro-
tein production. The primers used for cloning and site-directed muta-
genesis are listed in Table S1.
2.4. Protein expression and puriﬁcation
As i n g l ec l o n eo fE. coliBL21 (DE3) cells containing the gene of a var-
iant was inoculated in 5 mL LB medium with 50μg/mL kanamycin at
37 °C, 220 rpm. Then the overnight culture was grown in LB medium
with 50μg/mL kanamycin at 37 °C for 2 h to OD600 0.8–1.0, and then in-
duced by 0.4 mM isopropylβ-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 16 °C,
180 rpm for a further 20 h. TheE. coliBL21 (DE3) cells were harvested
by centrifugation (7000 ×g, 5 min, 4 °C), and washed twice and
suspended by binding buffer (50 mM Tris-HCL, 0.5 M NaCl, 5 mM imid-
azole, pH 9.5). Then the cells were disrupted by ultrasonication. The cell
precipitates were removed by centrifugation (12,000 ×g, 30 min, 4 °C)
and ﬁltration (0.45-μm ﬁlter, Φ25mm, JINTENG). The supernatant was
applied to a Ni-NTA afﬁnity column (Solarbio, Beijing) at 4 °C, then
washed with binding buffer followed by wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl,
0.5 M NaCl, 50 mM imidazole, pH 9.5). The target protein was eluted
with elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 0.5 M NaCl, 500 mM imidazole,
pH 9.5). The eluted fraction was applied to a dialysis membrane to
wash out the imidazole in dialysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCL, 0.5 M
NaCl, pH 9.5) at 4 °C. After concentration with PEG 8000, the puriﬁed
enzyme was stored in storage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCL, 0.5 M NaCl,
20%(v/v) glycerol, pH 9.5) at−80 °C. Protein concentration was mea-
sured by using a BCA Protein Assay Kit (CWBIO, Beijing).
2.5. Variants screen and evaluation by p-nitrophenyl palmitate (p-NPP)
colorimetric assay
The PETase catalyzed ester bond hydrolysis resulted in PET depoly-
merization, so that the ester bond ofp-nitrophenyl palmitate hydrolysis
could be used for fast screening of variants. The puriﬁed protein solution
(0.05 mg/mL, 2.5μL) was incubated at 50 °C for 30 min, then added into
187.5 μL of 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 9.5) with 10μL of p-NPP solution
(8 mM). After incubation for 10 min, 50μL of 10% (m/v) TCA was
added to stop the reaction, and 50μL of 10% (m/v) Na2CO3 was added
as a chromogenic agent. A total of 200μL of supernatant separated by
centrifugation was injected in a thin-walled 96-well PCR plate. The pro-
duction of p-nitrophenol (p-NP) was detected from the absorption at
410 nm in a multiscan spectrophotometer (SpectraMax M2, Molecular
Devices, US).
2.6. Analytical assessment of melting temperature
Thermal stability ofIsPETase and variants was determined by tem-
perature melting curves in differential scanning calorimetry (MicroCal
VP-Capillary DSC System, UN). Protein in storage buffer (~0.5 mg/mL,
400 μL) was monitored by increasing temperature from 25 to 90 °C at
a scanning rate of 200 °C/h. Melting temperature was determined
from theﬁrst thermal shift curve.
2.7. Analysis for thermostability of variants
The variant proteins in storage solution (0.05 mg/mL) were incu-
bated at 50 °C for 0, 5, 15, 30 and 60 min, and the residual activity was
measured byp-nitrophenyl palmitate (p-NPP) colorimetric assay as
stated above. The activity of enzyme without heat treatment was de-
ﬁned as 100%.

2.8. Analysis for the effects of temperature and pH on enzyme activity
The optimum temperatures of variants were determined at temper-
atures ranging from 25 °C to 60 °C in 50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 9.5). The op-
timum pH of variants was measured in 50 mM glycine-NaOH with pH
ranging from 8.5 to 10.5. The activity was determined by using ap-
nitrophenyl palmitate (p-NPP) colorimetric assay.
2.9. Kinetic analysis of variants for p-NPP
Variant proteins (1.09 μM) were incubated in 50 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 9.5) with 0.08, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, and 1.2μM at 40 °C. The p-
NP produced was detected by a multiscan spectrophotometer as men-
tioned above. Initial rates were plotted against p-NPP concentrations
and the kinetic parameters were determined by using the Michaelis–
Menten equation in Graph Pad Prism version 6 (GraphPad Software,
San Diego, CA).
2.10. Enzyme assays for BHET
The puriﬁed protein solution (14 mg/mL, 0.1μL) was added into
190 μL of 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 9.5) with 10μL of BHET solution
(9 mM). After incubation for 5 min at 40 °C, the reaction was terminated
by adding 100μL methyl alcohol. The reaction mixture was then ana-
lyzed by HPLC, after centrifugation (10,000 ×g,5m i n )a n dﬁltering
(0.22 μm).
2.11. Enzyme assays for amorphous PETﬂoccule
A Coca Cola bottle was cut into PET tablets (⌀6 mm, 10 mg), then dis-
solved in 0.5 mL of 1,1,1,3,3,3-hexaﬂuoro-2-propanol. A total of 20μLo f
this solution was added to 165μL reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-HCL, 20%
(v/v) glycerol, pH 9.5), to generate amorphous PETﬂoccule. Variant pro-
teins (15μL, 14 mg/mL) were added for PET degradation. After incuba-
tion at 40 °C for 24 h, the reaction was terminated by adding 100μL
methyl alcohol. After centrifugation (10,000 ×g,5m i n )a n dﬁltering
(0.22 μm), the reaction mixture was analyzed by HPLC.
2.12. HPLC analysis
HPLC analysis was performed on a 1200 series HPLC system (Agilent
Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a SunFire™ C18 col-
umn (5μm, 44.6 × 250 mm, Waters, Massachusetts, USA). The column
was developed with solvent A (ddH2O with 0.1% (v/v) triﬂuoroacetic
acid) and methyl alcohol at aﬂow rate of 0.8 mL/min. The percentage
of methyl alcohol was changed using a linear gradient from 1% to 5%
over 0–5 min, and from 5% to 100% over 5–15 min. The detection wave-
length was 240 nm.
2.13. Enzyme assays for bottle grade PET preform
A Coca Cola bottle was cut into PET tablets (⌀6 mm, 10 mg), then
melted using an alcohol lamp and cooled down to make PET preform.
A piece of preform was soaked in 200μL reaction buffer (50 mM Tris-
HCL, 20% (v/v) glycerol, pH 9.5) with 15 μL of variant proteins
(14 mg/mL). After 24 h, the weight of PET preform was measured, and
the change of shape was photographed.
2.14. LC-MS analyses
HR-ESI-MS was performed on an Agilent 1260 HPLC/6520 QTOF-MS
instrument (Santa Clara, CA, USA), equipped with an electrospray ioni-
zation source and a Poroshell 120 SB-C18 column (2.7 μm,
3.0 × 150 mm, Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The column was devel-
oped with solvent A (ddH2O with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid) and methyl al-
cohol at aﬂow rate of 0.55 mL/min. The percentage of methyl alcohol
was changed using a linear gradient from 5% to 40% over 1–3m i n ,a n d
from 40% to 50% over 3–7m i n .
2.15. Molecular docking and molecular-dynamics (MD) simulations
The wild-typeIsPETase three-dimensional structure was retrieved
from the PDB database (PDB ID: 6EQD). The three-dimensional
structures of the variants were constructed with Modeler 9.22 [27].
The molecular docking consisting ofIsPETase and 2-hydroxyethyl-
(monohydroxyethyl terephthalate)
4 (2-HE(MHET)4) was performed
by AutoDock vina 1.1.2 [28]and PyMOL 1.3 [29]. The substrate confor-
mation in the complex structures was based on previous reports
[30–32].
MD simulations were carried out on wild-type and W159H/F229Y
enzymes, in the free state, using the NAMD 2.12 [33] with CHARMM22
[34] forceﬁeld. The procedure has been reported previously [35]. The
protein structure was prepared for removing non-protein and hydrogen
atoms using Discovery Studio 2.5 (https://discover.3ds.com/discovery-
studio-visualizer-download). Protein molecules were placed in cubic
boxes at a minimum of 12 Å distance from the edge and were solvated
using TIP3P explicit water. To keep all systems neutral, 0.15 M NaCl was
added. Simulations were carried out using periodic boundary conditions
and a 12 Å cut-off for non-bonded interactions as well as a Particle Mesh
Ewald for long-range electrostatics. A time step of 2 fs was used, and
snapshots were saved every 1 ps. The protein was fully constrained,
and the solvent minimized for 2000 steps using a conjugate gradient al-
gorithm. The solvent was equilibrated for 100 ps under constant-
temperature, constant-pressure NPT conditions. The solvent was then
fully constrained, and the protein minimized for 2000 steps. The entire
system was then minimized for another 2000 steps and equilibrated for
100 ps under the same NPT conditions. Finally, a 20-ns MD simulation
was performed at 400 K in constant-energy, constant-volume ensemble
NVE conditions.
2.16. Phylogenetic analysis of IsPETase mutational sites
In total, 14 full-length protein sequences of known PETases
reviewed by Taniguchi et al. [36] were aligned by ClustalW. The phylo-
genetic analysis was performed with MEGA-X [37], and the guide tree
was obtained on the basis of the neighbor-joining method using the
p-distance model.
2.17. Crystallinity analyses by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC)
The crystallinity of bottle grade PET and preform were analyzed by
the DSC (NETZSCH DSC 214) with the previously described method
[38] at the ZHONG KE BAI CE Technology Service Company (Beijing,
China). A sample of 3 mg was heated from 0 to 280 °C at 10 °C min
−1.
The heat of PET meltingΔHm and heat of PET cold crystallizationΔHc
were determined by integrating areas (J g−1) under peaks. The heat of
melting (100% crystalline PET)ΔHm

3. Results
3.1. Protein engineering for improving the stability of IsPETase using
Premuse
To design potential mutations from the large number of homologs, a
protocol (Fig. 1) was proposed to integrate pairwise alignment [39], se-
quence weighting [40], position-speciﬁc amino acid probabilities
(PSAP) calculation [26], and preferred mutation selection. The sequence
alignment between the target sequence and each of the similar proteins
X. Meng, L. Yang, H. Liu et al. International Journal of Biological Macromolecules 180 (2021) 667–676
669
was calculated based on the Needleman-Wunsch alignment algorithm.
The PSAP of the target sequence were calculated based on the Dirichlet
mixture and sequence weighted methods. The mutations were quanti-
tatively selected from the PSAP matrix, which has a higher probability
of the mutation than the wild type. All of the calculations were inte-
grated into a web tool (Fig. 1) to predict the mutations based on se-
quence evolution (Premuse, http://www.elabcaas.cn/pird/premuse.
html).
To design the mutations ofIsPETase, 1486 sequences similar to
IsPETase with more than 40% identity and 50% coverage were obtained
from NCBI [41] with the tool BLASTP suite [42]. Ten mutations with
large differences in the PSAP matrix between the mutation and wild
type were selected based on the calculation of Premuse and are
shown inTable 1. For instance, the wild-type amino acid at position
159 was tryptophan (W), and the frequency of occurrence in the
sequence alignments (Table 1) was 14.8%; however, the most highly
conserved residue in the same site of homologs was histidine, at a
frequency of 82.6%. It can be speculated that the function of mutation
W159H could be more advantageous than wild type for maintaining
structural or conformational stability of the protein.
3.2. Characterization of variants improved thermal stability
To evaluate the effect of the mutation on thermal stability, the genes
of ten mutants and wild type were constructed in the expression plas-
mid pET-30a(+). The protein expression was induced overnight at
16 °C inE. colistrain BL21(DE3). As biodegradation of PET was time-
consuming, the p-NPP colorimetric assay was carried out for prelimi-
nary variant screening and enzymatic characterization. After incubation
at 50 °C for half an hour, the remaining p-NPP hydrolysis activity of var-
iants was determined. The wild type remained at 16.5%, while the resid-
ual activities of G139S, W159H and F229Y were dramatically enhanced,
at 59.2%, 78.4% and 51.5% respectively (Fig. 2A).
To further conﬁrm the stability improvement, theTm values of vari-
ants were also measured. TheTm value of G139S, 50.5 °C, was similar to
that of wild type. In contrast, theTm values of W159H and F229Y were
57.6 °C and 54.4 °C, which were 6.8 °C and 3.6 °C higher than the
50.8 °C of wild type (Fig. 2B).
The Tm value and residual enzyme activity of W159H and F229Y var-
iants were higher than those of wild type, which indicated that the
structure and activity of both variants were improved. Therefore, the
two variants were selected to construct the combined variant W159H/
F229Y. Its remaining activity was 96.0% andTm value was 61.2 °C, indi-
cating further substantial improvement over wild type.
In order to verify the stability improvement of W159H/F229Y, the
thermo- stability and optimal temperature of variants were character-
ized. The residual enzyme activity of mutant W159H/F229Y was basi-
cally unchanged in the course of one hour of heat treatment at 50 °C.
The mutant W159H and F229Y lost partial activity, with 78.4% and

51.5% residual enzyme activity. However, the residual enzyme activity
of wild type was only 16.5%, which meant it lost most of its enzyme ac-
tivity (Fig. 3A).
3.3. Temperature and pH dependency of wild type and variants
The optimal temperature of variant F229Y was the same as wild
type, at 40 °C. The optimal temperature of variant W159H was 45 °C,
and the optimal temperature of combined variant W159H/F229Y was
50 °C (Fig. 3B). This sharp rise in optimal temperature indicated that
W159H/F229Y had good stability, which was in good agreement with
the above results.
To investigate changes in physical and chemical properties caused
by variants, an assay for optimal pH value was carried out. All variants
had optimal enzyme activity between pH 9.0 and 9.5, and there was
no visible difference among them in terms of pH (Fig. S1). The consis-
tency in optimal pH value indicated that the change in variants was
mainly higher thermal stability.
3.4. Catalytic efﬁciency of wild type and mutants
The catalytic efﬁciency of variants was also determined at 40 °C.
Compared with the wild type, the kinetic parameter (kcat/Km)o f
W159H/F229Y for p-NPP hydrolysis was increased by 100% (Table 2),
and the hydrolytic activity for bis (2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid
(BHET) of W159H/F229Y was 2.6 times as much as that of wild type
(Fig. S2). These results showed that the catalytic efﬁciency of W159H/
F229Y was improved.
3.5. Increased thermal stability and catalytic efﬁciency resulted in enhanced
PET degradation activity
Long term stability measurements of wild type and W159H/F229Y
were performed at 40 °C for 24 h, to ensure that the enzyme could func-
tion for a long time in the process of PET degradation. As expected,
W159H/F229Y lost less enzyme activity at a slower rate than the wild
type (Fig. S3). While the half-life of W159H/F229Y was 26.6 h, the
half-life of wild type was only 9.7 h.
With the signiﬁcantly improved performance of W159H/F229Y,
the anticipated amorphous PET digestion was explored. After
incubation for 24 h at 40 °C, the total concentration of released com-
pound by W159H/F229Y had a 40-fold increase over that released by

( M H E T ) ,a n dB H E T ,w e r ei d e n t iﬁed by HPLC-HR-MS analysis
(Figs. 4B and S4). This result was consistent with that reported by
Yoshida et al[17].
The high performance of W159H/F229Y suggested that its potential
applications could be extended to biodegradation for PET waste (29.2 ±
0.8% crystallinity), which causes ubiquitous pollution. The use of
W159H/F229Y for decomposition of PET bottle preform (10.7 ± 0.6%
crystallinity) was examined. The PET bottle preform treated by wild
type displayed slight changes in shape or weight, due to the poor stabil-
ity ofIsPETase. However, the PET bottle preform lost 1.8 mg after it was
treated by W159H/F229Y for 3 days, and the mean decomposition rate
reached 23.4 mgPET/h/mgenzyme. Additionally, some particles clearly fell
off from the main body and then disappeared due to decomposition by
W159H/F229Y (Fig. 4C and D). These results therefore further inspired
the enzymatic processing of PET waste.
3.6. Molecular-dynamics simulations revealed the mechanism underlying
W159H/F229Y Improvement
To gain better insight into the structural effects of the mutations,
molecular-dynamics simulations of the enzymes were carried out. The
root mean square deviation (RMSD) of W159H/F229Y was signiﬁcantly
lower than that of wild type (Fig. 5A), and the number of hydrogen
bonds of W159H/F229Y was signiﬁcantly higher than that of wild type
(Fig. 5B). A substantial difference in root mean squareﬂuctuations
(RMSF) was observed in the area of amino acid 205 to 235 (Fig. 5C),
where most of the extra hydrogen bonds derived from F229Y were con-
centrated (Figs. 5D, S5 and S6A). As this area was near the active site,
change may greatly increase protein stability. The number of salt
bonds (Fig. S6B) and structural electrostatic energies (Fig. S7) were
also determined by molecular dynamics simulation, but there was no
obvious change between F229Y and wild type.
The substitution of histidine for tryptophan in the W159H mutation
reduced the distance between residues Asp118 and Arg123 from 5.5 Å
in wild type to 2.7 Å in W159H. In addition, a new salt bridge formed,
which was not present in F229Y but was retained in W159H/F229Y
(Fig. 6A). This was consistent with theTm value of W159H being
2.5 °C higher than F229Y (Fig. 2B), and suggested the key molecular
mechanism to improve the variant stability. However, the substitution
of histidine for tryptophan in W159H mutation conferred a new salt
bridge interaction between residue H159 and 2-HE(MHET)4. Residue
Trp185 was observed to formπ-π interactions with the aromatic motif
of the PET polymer (Fig. S8), which was also suggested by Cui et al.
[38]. This result signiﬁcantly enhanced the binding afﬁnity for PET poly-
mer, and could explain the lowerKm value of W159H (Table 2). All of
these results indicated that W159H contributed more than F229Y to in-
crease enzyme properties.
4. Discussion
Traditional consensus design strategies rely on manual selection of
protein sequences for MSA, which limits their utilization. Premuse, the
alternative to manual MSA construction is standardized for sequence
alignment and quantitative selection of the preferred mutations. In the
sequence alignment, Premuse only considers the alignment between
the target sequence and homologs from the database, rather than the
entire MSA. Therefore, the method could exponentially reduce the com-
putation quantity, allowing it to easily deal with large datasets, and
mine information from big-data. Consequently, the expanded size ho-
mologs based on big-data (1486 protein sequences) could not only re-
ﬂect the results of natural evolution, but also allow for the advantages
of this design strategy. As a result, this strategy could avoid the huge
amount of work from saturation mutagenesis [16], and randomness of
rational protein engineering [18,20], due to widespread epistatic effects
and dependence on a speciﬁc structure [43–45]. Austin et al. [32]

produced a double mutant S238F/W159H to makeIsPETase more
cutinase-like and narrow the binding cleft, improved PET degradation
was observed. Premuse also designed W159H, it indicated that the ar-
ithmetic could act as a professional designer for the protein engineering.
The p-NPP colorimetric assay used in this study avoided slow prog-
ress in decomposition of PET, which was rapid and effective for screen-
ing and characterizingIsPETase variants. The successful application of
W159H/F229Y in PET bottle biodegradation also manifested its rational-
ity. The MD simulations suggested the effect of mutations on stability
and activity enhancement, which explained the improvementvia a
structural view.
To date, a series of enzymes have been identiﬁed as PETases bio-
chemically, which were able to hydrolyze natural polyester and retain
broad substrate speciﬁcity [36]. The stability of these PETases varied,

and the PETases with higher optimal temperature could be more stable,
so that the MSA and phylogenetic trees could be constructed to illus-
trate the changes in stability over evolutionary time (Fig. 7). These
PETases could be clustered into three groups with different optimal
temperatures: low-temperature PETases (≤40 °C) [14,17,46], medium-
temperature PETases (50 –60 °C) [47–49], and high-temperature
PETases (≥60 °C) [50–53]. In low-temperature PETases, the amino acid
at site 159 was tryptophan (W), isoleucine (I), or tyrosine (Y) rather
than histidine (H), and the amino acid at site 229 was phenylalanine
(F) instead of tyrosine (Y). However, in almost all sequences from
medium-temperature and high-temperature groups, the amino acid
was H at site 159, and Y at site 229. Interestingly, PET5, whose optimal
temperature was 50 °C, was an exception, although its amino acid at
site 229 was Y, the amino acid at site 159 was W rather than H. On
one hand, PET5 andIsPETase had a very close genetic relationship. On
the other hand, PET5 was in the medium-temperature PETases group,
while the optimal temperature ofIsPETase was 40 °C. This indicated
that PET5 could function transitionally in the process of evolving stabil-
ity. In brief, the phylogenetic analysis also demonstrated the importance
of W159H and F229Y for stability of PETases. First, the hypothesis at the
basis of this strategy was accurate. Second, it meant that this strategy
utilized evolutionary history and identi ﬁed stabilizing features

encapsulated in homologous protein sequences. In the phylogenetic
analysis, the amino acids in almost all PETases in medium-temperature
and high-temperature groups were the same as W159H/F229Y, which
proved the accuracy of the theory from consensus design in reverse.
In summary, using improved consensus protein engineering,
W159H/F229Y-catalyzed PET bottle waste biodegradation was im-
proved, with a mean decomposition rate of 23.4 mgPET/h/mgenzyme.
The I. sakaiensisbacterium secretesIsPETase that catalyzes the degrada-
tion of PET to monomers as a carbon source for catabolization. W159H/
F229Y performed well for efﬁcient PET bottle preform degradation at a
mild temperature, and provided concepts and solutions for construction
of engineered bacteria in this area. Moreover, this study has demon-
strated that the Premuse strategy can be very effectively utilized in pro-
tein engineering to enhance stability.
