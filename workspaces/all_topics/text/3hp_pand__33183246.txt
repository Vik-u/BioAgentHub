Abstract
Background: Propionic acidemia (PA) is a severe monogenic disorder characterized by a deficiency of the
mitochondrial protein propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) enzyme, which is caused by mutations in the PCCA or PCCB
gene. Preconception carrier screening could provide couples with meaningful information for their reproductive
options; however, it is not widely performed in China.
Case presentation: This report describes a case of dizygotic twin siblings conceived by in vitro fertilization (IVF)
and diagnosed with propionic acidemia (PA). Their parents had no history of PA. Tandem mass spectrometry and
urine gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) of the twin siblings revealed markedly elevated propionyl
carnitine (C3), C3/C2, and 3-hydroxypropionate in the plasma and urine. Whole-exome sequencing was performed
for the twin siblings. A homozygous missense mutation, c.2002G > A (p.Gly668Arg) in PCCA, was identified in the
twin siblings. Sanger sequencing confirmed the homozygous mutation in the twin siblings and identified their
parents as heterozygous carriers of the c.2002G > A mutation in PCCA. Both neonates in this case died. This is an
emotionally and financially devastating outcome that could have been avoided with genetic carrier screening
before conception. If couples are screened before IVF and found to be silent carriers, then reproductive options
(such as preimplantation genetic diagnosis or prenatal diagnosis) can be offered to achieve a healthy newborn.
Conclusion: This case is a reminder to infertile couples seeking IVF that it is beneficial to clarify whether they are
silent carriers before undergoing IVF.

Background
Propionic acidemia (PA) is a rare, life-threatening meta-
bolic disorder caused by a deficiency of the mitochon-
drial propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC) enzyme. PA has
an estimated incidence of 1 per 100,000 to 150,000 [ 1].
The PCC enzyme catalyzes carboxylation of propionyl-
CoA to D-methylmalonyl-CoA; therefore, PA is charac-
terized by toxic accumulation of propionyl-CoA and me-
tabolites of branched chain amino acid catabolism, such
as 3-hydroxypropionic acid and propionyl carnitine (C3)
in plasma and urine [ 1]. Most patients present with
ketoacidosis, difficulty feeding, lethargy, seizures, en-
cephalopathy, and failure to thrive during the neonatal
period. Patients who live beyond the neonatal period

ease, cardiomyopathies, and pancreatitis [ 2, 3].
PCC is a heterododecamer composed of six propionyl-
CoA carboxylase alpha subunits and six propionyl-CoA
carboxylase beta subunits. The alpha and beta subunits
of the PCC enzyme are encoded by the PCCA and PCCB
genes, which map to chromosome 13q32.3 and chromo-
some 3q22.3, respectively. Mutations in PCCA or PCCB
result in defects of the PCC enzyme, leading to PA. To
date, more than 200 variants of the PCCA or PCCB
genes have been identified [ 4, 5]. PA is inherited in an
autosomal recessive manner. Missense mutations ac-
count for approximately 50% of the variations and are
the most frequent defects in PCCA and PCCB [6].
Assisted reproductive technologies (ART), including
in vitro fertilization (IVF), are used to overcome infertil-
ity in many families. The goal of IVF is not only to
achieve pregnancy but also to take home a healthy baby.
Mendelian diseases are individually rare; however, col-
lectively, they account for approximately 20% of infant
mortality cases and approximately 10% of pediatric hos-
pitalizations [ 7, 8]. Preconception carrier screening has
gained more recognition; however, it is not widely per-
formed for ART patients in China. We report a case of
dizygotic twin siblings conceived by in vitro fertilization
(IVF) who died of PA. The homozygous missense muta-
tion c.2002G > A (p.Gly668Arg) in PCCA was identified
in the twin siblings using whole-exome sequencing. The
parents had no history of PA but were unknown carriers
of the c.2002G > A mutation in PCCA.
Case presentation
Two newborn dizygotic twin siblings were born to unre-
lated nonconsanguineous parents with normal karyo-
types. The pregnancy was achieved by IVF because of
the mother ’s fertility problems. The father had normal
documented semen parameters. The mother initially
presented to our institution at age 28 years with a 1-year
history of secondary infertility. She had two previous
pregnancies that resulted in one spontaneous abortion
and one abortive ectopic pregnancy. Her menstrual cycles
were irregular, with intervals of 28 – 45 days. She was diag-
nosed with polycystic ovary syndrome and hypothyroidism
at our reproductive center. Her hysterosalpingogram
showed no abnormalities, but she experienced a second ec-
topic pregnancy after ovulation induction treatment in our
reproductive center. Unilateral salpingectomy was con-
ducted through laparoscopy. The couple decided to try
IVF. GnRH antagonist protocols were performed, 21 oo-
cytes were retrieved, 16 oocytes were fertilized, and 12 em-
bryos were formed; however, only four good-quality day 3
embryos were frozen. No pregnancies resulted from the
first frozen embryo transfer (FET) cycle during which 2 day
3 embryos were thawed. The second FET cycle involved
transferring 2 day 3 embryos, which resulted in the birth of
dizygotic twin siblings. The mother was 31 years old and
the father was 36 years old at the time of delivery.
The patients were dizygotic twin siblings born at 38
weeks of gestation. The birth weight of the girl was
2630 g and the birth weight of the boy was 2130 g. The
girl was 1 week old when she presented with difficulty
feeding, coma, seizures, acidosis, respiratory failure, neo-
natal septicemia, and hyperammonemia. A urinary organic
acid analysis revealed elevation of 3-hydroxypropionic
acid. Tandem mass spectrometry showed that she had ele-
vated C3 and C3/C2 (Table 1), indicating she had PA. Her
twin brother presented with difficulty feeding, lethargy,
acidosis, neonatal septicemia, and hyperammonemia at
the age of 1 week. Elevated 3-hydroxypropionic acid in
urine and elevated C3 and C3/C2 in plasma suggested that
he had PA (Table 1).
To identify the cause, whole-exome sequencing was
performed for the twins by Guangzhou Kingmed Diag-
nostics Group Co., Ltd. Blood samples were collected
from the patients, and genomic DNA was extracted
using the QIAamp DNA Blood Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany). The DNA libraries after enrichment and
purification were sequenced on the NextSeq500 sequencer
according to the manufacturer ’s instructions (Illumina,
San Diego, CA, USA). All reads were aligned to the refer-
ence human genome (UCSC hg19) using Burrows-
Wheeler Aligner software (version 0.5.9-r16). The homo-
zygous missense mutation c.2002G > A (p.Gly668Arg) in
PCCA was identified in both twins; c.2002G > A is a
known pathogenic mutation leading to PA. Furthermore,
bioinformatic tools including PolyPhen 2, Sift, Mutation
Taster, and MutPred score all classified this variation as
pathogenic (Table S 1). Sanger sequencing was performed
for the two patients and their parents (Fig. 1). The parents
had no history of PA; however, they were both identified
as carriers of mutation c.2002G > A in PCCA. The girl
died 24 h after hospitalization. Her twin brother died at
age 1 month.
Discussion and conclusions
We report dizygotic twin siblings conceived by IVF who
both died of PA soon after birth. Genetic testing showed
that the twins had a pathogenetic mutation in the PCCA
gene and that their parents were unknown carriers of
that PCCA mutation, thus confirming the diagnosis of
PA. This type of event is mentally, emotionally, and fi-
nancially devasting for families.
Variation c.2002G > A is located in exon 22 and causes
an amino acid substitution at the 668 site of the PCCA
protein. Gupta et al. screened PCCA and PCCB genes of
25 children in India with PA and identified that the
c.2002G > A variation was associated with PA [ 9]. Bio-
informatic tools classified this variation as pathogenic.

This missense mutation c.2002G > A is in the biotinyl-
ation domain at the C-terminus. Campeau et al. exam-
ined this mutation (as Gly643Arg) in vitro to determine
its capacity to support biotinylation and found that it de-
creased biotinylation by 95% of its initial value [ 10]. In
this case report, the infertile couple was heterozygous
for the missense mutation c.2002G > A; however, their
genetic compositions were unknown before the delivery
of their twins with PA.
Preconception carrier screening revealed that the aver-
age genomic carrier burden for severe pediatric recessive
mutations was 2.8 [ 11]. Currently, because of techno-
logical advances like next-generation sequencing (NGS),
preconception screening has become more feasible re-
gardless of family history. According to recommenda-
tions (American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology
Committee on Genetics), the disorders included in
expanded carrier screening panels should: have a carrier
frequency of 1 in 100 or greater, have a well-defined
phenotype, have a detrimental effect on quality of life,
cause cognitive or physical impairment, require surgical or
medical intervention, or have an onset early in life [ 12].
The overall outcome of PA remains poor despite the exist-
ence of effective therapy such as a low-protein diet [ 1]. PA
could be predicted through the usage of preconception
genetic carrier screening and genetic counseling about re-
productive options (such as preimplantation genetic diag-
nosis or prenatal diagnosis).
In the present study, twins with PA were conceived by
an infertile couple through ART. Expanded preconcep-
tion genetic carrier screening using NGS found that 5%
of couples undergoing ART using their own gametes
had pathogenic variants [ 13]. Researchers have estimated
that preconception genetic carrier screening before ART

for couples and patients requiring gamete donation re-
sults in prevention of 1.25% of newborns from being af-
fected [ 13]. Franasiak et al. conducted expanded carrier
screening for 3738 infertile couples and identified eight
couples at risk of having an affected child, which indi-
cated that expanded carrier screening affected the clin-
ical decisions in 0.21% of cases associated with the
infertile population [ 14]. Preconception carrier testing,
ideally before pregnancy, is recommended by various
professional societies [ 12, 15]. It is important to perform
genetic screening of couples before ART to determine
any genetic mutations so that steps (such as PGD) can
be taken so that newborns conceived with ART are not
affected. However, preconception carrier screening is
not widely performed for ART patients in China. This
case should be a reminder to infertile couples that it is
critical to be aware of whether they are silent carriers
before undergoing ART to reduce the risk of having an
affected newborn. If two silent carriers are screened be-
fore IVF, a PGD procedure will be offered to achieve a
genetically healthy newborn [ 16]. Further large-scale
studies were needed to evaluate the benefits and the ne-
cessity of preconception carrier screening for infertile
couples seeking ART.
