Abstract
Melatonin (MT) can improve plant resistance and fruit quality. The mechanism by which MT affects soluble sugar 
and organic acids accumulation in drupe fruits is not clear. In this study, 100 µmol/L MT was sprayed on the leaves 
of plum trees at the second stage of rapid fruit expansion (90 and 97 d after flowering), and the effects of MT on 
plum fruit quality and its effects on the soluble sugar-organic acid metabolism were investigated. At 28 d after 
MT treatment (at maturity), the longitudinal diameter, fruit weight, and vitamin C content of plum fruits were 
increased by 5.05%, 12.93%, and 56.09%, respectively, compared to the control. MT caused significant increase 
in the total soluble solids content and decreased the titratable acid content. MT increased the contents of total 
soluble sugar, sucrose, sorbitol, and citric acid after 21 and 28 days of treatment, while decreasing the contents 
of fructose, malic acid, quinic acid, and tartaric acid after 28 days of treatment. Additionally, MT increased the 
activities of sucrose synthase (catabolism direction), sucrose phosphate synthase, glucokinase, fructokinase, sorbitol 
oxidase, and NADP +-malic enzyme, and decreased the activities of soluble acid converting enzyme, cell wall 
insoluble converting enzyme, NAD +-sorbitol dehydrogenase, and NAD +-malic dehydrogenase after 21 or 28 days of 
treatment. Moreover, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) after 21 and 28 days of treatment were accelerated 
starch and sucrose metabolism, galactose metabolism, fructose and mannose metabolism, as well as glycolysis, 
gluconeogenesis, and pentose phosphate metabolism pathways. In conclusion, exogenous MT increases soluble 
sugar content and decreases organic acid content in plum fruits by regulating various soluble sugar-organic acid 
metabolic pathways, thereby improving the fruit quality.

Introduction
Soluble sugars and organic acids are crucial in influenc -
ing the sensory characteristics of horticultural fruit prod-
ucts and are essential for developing fruit flavor [ 1]. The 
types, concentrations, and ratios of these compounds 
have a significant impact on the taste and texture of 
fruits, and soluble sugars typically include glucose, fruc -
tose, sucrose, and sorbitol while organic acids commonly 
found in fruits are malic, citric, oxalic, tartaric, quinic, 
succinic, and pyruvic acids [ 2–5]. The composition and 
levels of soluble sugars and organic acids can vary among 
different fruit species and varieties, as well as change 
throughout different stages of fruit development within 
the same species [ 6]. However, excessive use of chemical 
fertilizers in the pursuit of larger fruits and higher yields 
can result in a decline in fruit quality [7]. Therefore, there 
is a need to adopt tactics that will improve the quality of 
fruits.
Melatonin (MT), a safe indole derivative of tryptophan, 
is widely found in living organisms [ 8, 9]. Studies have 
shown that MT treatment at appropriate concentrations 
can improve plant resistance, maintain the freshness of 
fruit and vegetable products, and improve fruit quality 
[10–12]. The reason is the fact that MT exerts its influ -
ence on instigating the defense mechanisms within fruits 
via the generation of polyphenolic substances, thereby 
playing a crucial role in enhancing the fruits’ natural 
resistance and safeguarding their quality and vitality 
[13–15]. Depending on the concentration of MT used 
or the time of application, different fruit species produce 
different effects [ 16–18]. For example, application of 100 
µmol/L MT on pear trees revealed an increase in the sol -
uble solids content of fruits during the ripening period, 
decreased the expression level of sucrose converting 
enzyme gene Pbinvertase1/2 and its enzyme activity, 
and increased the expression level of sucrose phospho -
ribosyl synthase gene PbSPS1/2/3 and its enzyme activ -
ity, resulting in an increase in starch and soluble sugar 
content in fruits [ 19]. Exogenous MT increased the yield 
of sweet cherries under poor climatic conditions, and a 
concentration of 300 µmol/L increased the quality, color, 
hardness, titratable acid content, and soluble solids con -
tent of fruits at the ripening stage [ 20]. In pomegranates, 
exogenous MT increased fruit size, fruit number, and 
yield, with a concentration of 100 µmol/L MT increas -
ing the contents of total soluble solids and titratable acid 
[21]. In strawberries, a concentration of 100 µmol/L MT 
increased the total phenol content, free radical scaveng -
ing activity, glucose, and fructose content [ 22]. Addition-
ally, higher concentrations of MT inhibited the growth 
of wild-type apple plants, induced the accumulation of 
fructose, glucose, and sucrose in leaves, down-regulated 
the expression level of fructose kinase gene MdFRK2 and 
fructokinase activity, and increased the activity of sucrose 
phosphosynthase (SPS) [ 23]. The ripening of grape ber -
ries, SPS activity, and accumulation of soluble sugars 
were promoted with the application of 100 µmol/L MT 
[24]. Other studies also showed that 100–150 µmol/L 
MT improved the quality of fruits, increased their soluble 
sugar content, and decreased their organic acid content 
[18, 24, 25]. Therefore, MT can increase the accumula -
tion of soluble sugar and decrease the accumulation of 
organic acid, though its mechanism is not clear.
Plum ( Prunus salicina ) is a deciduous fruit tree bear -
ing drupe fruits that are rich in nutrients, soluble sugars, 
organic acids, amino acids, minerals, and antioxidants, 
and possess a strong flavor [26]. However, due to the mis-
use of chemical fertilizers and other unscientific cultiva -
tion techniques, the quality and taste of plum fruits have 
deteriorated [ 27]. Previous studies have indicated that 
the application of 100 µmol/L MT can enhance the con -
tent of soluble sugar and reduce the level of organic acids 
in drupe fruits [ 18, 25]. Nevertheless, the exact mecha -
nism behind this effect remains unclear. In this study, 
we sprayed 100 µmol/L of MT onto the leaves of plum 
trees during the second phase of rapid fruit expansion 
to examine the impact of exogenous MT on the quality 
of plum fruits and the underlying mechanism of soluble 
sugar-organic acid metabolism. The findings of this study 
could serve as a cornerstone for enhancing the quality of 
plum fruits.
Materials and methods
Materials
The plum variety used in this study was ‘Qiangcuidali’ , 
grafted onto wild peach (rootstock). The four-year-old 
plum trees were planted in the orchard of Sichuan Hui -
jia Seven Colorful Fields Agricultural Technology Co., 
located in Chengdu, China (30°38 ′N, 104°13 ′E). The 
planting density was four meters between plants and 
three meters between rows.
MT was obtained from Beijing Solarbio Science & 
Technology Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China).
Experimental design
In May 2022, the plum fruits reached the second rapid 
expansion period, which occurred 90 days after flower -
ing, we selected 18 uniform growth plum trees for the 
experimental treatment. There were two treatments 
in this experiment: (1) control (CK), where nine plum 
trees were foliar sprayed with tap water; (2) MT treat -
ment, where nine plum trees were foliar sprayed with 
100 µmol/L of MT solution [ 18, 25]. Each plum tree 
was sprayed with approximately 3 L of tap water or MT 
solution until the leaves started dripping. Three repli -
cations were conducted for each treatment, with three 
trees included in each replication. The MT and tap water 
treatments were reapplied after a 7-day interval. Fruits

Xiao et al. BMC Plant Biology          (2024) 24:1208 
were collected at 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days following the 
initial treatment for maturity evaluation. Samples were 
collected randomly in the east, south, west, and north 
directions to obtain medium-sized fruits, approximately 
10 fruits per direction. Following each sampling, fruits 
were promptly transferred to an icebox and taken to the 
laboratory. Upon arrival, basic quality parameters were 
immediately assessed, after which the pulp was chopped 
and mixed, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 ℃ 
for later parameter determination.
Determination of parameters
Determination of fruit quality
An electronic balance was used to measure the single 
fruit weight. A digital vernier caliper was used to measure 
both the transverse and longitudinal diameters of the 
fruits. The total soluble solids content was determined 
with a PAL-1 handheld refractometer, the titratable 
acid content was determined by titration with a sodium 
hydroxide solution, and the vitamin C content was deter-
mined using the 2,6-dichloroindophenol method [28].
Determination of soluble sugar components and starch 
contents
The sulfuric acid-anthrone colorimetric method was uti -
lized to measure the total soluble sugar content [ 29]. The 
extraction methods for soluble sugar components (glu -
cose, fructose, sucrose, and sorbitol) followed the pro -
tocol established by Li et al. (2014) [ 30]. The individual 
contents of soluble sugar components were analyzed 
using a high-performance liquid chromatography sys -
tem (Agilent 1260 HPLC, Agilent Technologies) with an 
Anthena NH2 C18 column (250  mm × 4.6  mm, 5  μm) 
and a mobile phase of acetonitrile and ultrapure water at 
a ratio of 80:20. The analysis was conducted with a flow 
rate of 1 mL/min, a column temperature set to 40 ℃, and 
an injection volume of 10 µL.
The starch content was determined using a starch kit 
(Suzhou Grace Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Suzhou, China), 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Determination of soluble sugar and starch metabolism 
enzymes activities
The activities of sucrose synthetase (synthetic direc -
tion, SS-s), sucrose synthetase (catabolism direction, 
SS-c), SPS, soluble acid invertase (S-AI), cell wall inver -
tase (CWINV), neutral invertase (NI), NAD +-sorbitol 
dehydrogenase (NAD +-SDH), sorbitol oxidase (SOX), 
hexokinase (HK), glucokinase (GK), fructokinase (FK), 
ATP-phosphate fructose kinase (PFK), α-amylase, and 
β-amylase were determined using the correspond kit 
(Suzhou Grace Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Suzhou, China), 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Determination of organic acid components contents
The organic acid components (malic acid, quinic acid, cit-
ric acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, and α-ketoglutaric acid) 
were extracted using the method described by Bao (2022) 
[31]. The contents of organic acid components were ana -
lyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography 
(Thermo Scientific UltiMate 3000, Thermo Fisher Scien -
tific Inc.). The chromatographic column used was Inertsil 
AQ-C18 (250 mm × 4.6 mm, 5 μm), with a mobile phase 
of potassium phosphate buffer (0.04  mol/L): metha -
nol = 99:1 (pH 2.6). The analysis was conducted with a 
flow rate of 0.8 mL/min, the column temperature set at 
30 ℃, and an injection volume of 10 µL.
Determination of organic acid metabolism enzymes activities
The activities of NADP +-malate dehydrogenase (NAD +-
MDH), NADP +-malate synthase (NADP +-ME), and 
phosphoenolpyruvic acid carboxylase (PEPC) were 
determined using the correspond kit (Suzhou Grace Bio -
technology Co., Ltd., Suzhou, China), according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions.
Transcriptome sequencing analysis
The transcriptome data of plum pulps at 21 and 28 d after 
treatment [32] were utilized in this study. Transcriptome 
sequencing yielded a total of 79.83 Gb of clean data, with 
a Q30% exceeding 94.20% and a GC content greater than 
45.94%. The clean reads were aligned with the reference 
gene ( Prunus_salicina.v1.0.genome.fa), and the align -
ment of clean reads from each sample with the reference 
genome ranged from 93.29 to 94.61%. A total of 3,194 
new genes were identified, 2,018 of which were function -
ally annotated. In this study, a fold change of ≥ 1.5 and a 
P value of < 0.01 were used as criteria for screening differ-
entially expressed genes (DEGs). At 21 d after treatment, 
the DEGs annotated to the GO, KEGG, and NR data -
bases were 350, 302, and 436, respectively. At 28 d after 
treatment, the DEGs annotated to the GO, KEGG, and 
NR databases were 306, 260, and 367, respectively.
Candidate DEGs expression analysis by quantitative RT-PCR 
(qRT-PCR)
The M5 Super Plus qPCR RT kit with gDNA remover 
from Mei5 Biotechnology Co., Ltd, Beijing, China was 
used to perform the first strand cDNA synthesis of the 
chosen DEGs, following the manufacturer’s guidelines. 
Primers were designed with Primer premier 5.0 software 
using the reference gene sequences in plum (Table  1), 
with the lattice protein articulator complex medium sub -
unit family protein gene ( CAC) utilized as an internal 
reference gene [ 33]. qRT-PCR of the DEGs was carried 
out using the 2X M5 HiPer SYBR Premix EsTaq (with Tli 
RNaseH) kit from Mei5 Biotechnology Co., Ltd., follow -
ing the manufacturer’s instructions.

Results
Fruit quality of plum
Longer period after treatment, there was a rise in the 
single fruit weight, transverse and longitudinal diam -
eter, total soluble solids contents, and vitamin C content 
of plum fruits, while the titratable acid content declined 
(Fig. 1). Compared with CK, MT treatment increased the 
single fruit weight by 18.56% and 12.93%, longitudinal 
diameter by 5.37% and 5.05%, soluble solids contents by 
1.36 and 1.13% points, and vitamin C content by 115.66% 
and 56.09%, respectively, at 21 and 28 d after treatment, 
while did not affect these parameters at other treatment 
times. Further, MT treatment did not affect the trans -
verse diameter at different treatment times. In compari -
son to CK, MT decreased the titratable acid content by 
0.18 and 0.10% points, respectively, at 7 and 28 d after 
treatment, while did not affect this parameter at other 
treatment times.
Soluble sugar and starch metabolisms of plum fruits
Contents of total soluble sugar and its components
Longer period after treatment, the contents of total sol -
uble sugar, sucrose and sorbitol in plum fruits exhibited 
a gradual increase, whereas the levels of glucose and 
fructose showed a pattern of initially increasing and then 
decreasing (Fig.  2). Compared with CK, MT increased 
the content of soluble sugar by 19.96%, 14.52%, 7.78%, 
and 9.74%, respectively, at 7, 14, 21, and 28 d after treat -
ment. It only increased the content of glucose at 7 d after 
treatment and decreased the content of fructose at 28 
d after treatment. The sucrose content in MT-treated 
fruits increased by 45.66%%, 50.72%, 47.81%, and 20.07%, 
respectively, at 7, 14, 21, and 28 d after treatment, com -
pared with CK. The sorbitol content in MT-treated fruits 
was higher than in CK at 14, 21, and 28 d after treatment, 
with increases of 31.80%, 19.95%, and 8.67% over CK, 
respectively. There was no significant difference for sor -
bitol content in MT-treated fruits at 7 d after treatment.
Activities of soluble sugar metabolism enzymes
The treatment of MT did not have a significant effect on 
the activities of SS-s, NI, and HK in plum fruits at differ -
ent treatment times (Fig.  3). In comparison to CK, MT 
treatment led to a decrease in the activities of SS-c and 
FK at 21 d after treatment, an increase at 28 d after treat -
ment, and no significant impact at other treatment times. 
For the activities of SPS and GK, MT treatment increased 
their activities at 7, 14, and 28 d after treatment, with the 
increases of 16.55%, 33.84%, and 23.89% for SPS activ -
ity, and the increases of 8.55%, 7.91%, and 12.33% for GK 
activity, respectively, compared with CK. There were no 
significant differences for the activities of SPS and GK 
between MT treatment and CK at 14 d after treatment. 
Additionally, the activities of S-AI and CWINV were 
enhanced by MT treatment at 7 and 21 d post-treatment 
but reduced at 14 and 28 d post-treatment. Furthermore, 
MT treatment boosted the activity of NAD +-SDH at 14 
days post-treatment but decreased it at 21 and 28 d post-
treatment. It also increased the activity of SOX at 7 and 
28 d post-treatment but lowered it at 14 days post-treat -
ment. The activity of PFK decreased at 7 days post-treat -
ment and increased at 14 and 28 d post-treatment with 
MT treatment, while remaining unaffected at other time 
points.
Content of starch and its activities of metabolic enzymes
In comparison to CK, MT treatment resulted in a 14.73% 
increase in starch content in plum fruits at 7 d after treat-
ment, while no significant effect was observed at other 
time points (Fig.  4). Furthermore, at 7 d after treatment, 
MT treatment led to a 22.95% increase in α-amylase 
activity and a 20.93% increase in β-amylase activity com -
pared to CK. Conversely, at 14 d after treatment, MT

treatment caused a decrease of 13.22% and 11.65% in 
α-amylase and β-amylase activities, respectively, com -
pared to CK, with no impact on these parameters at 
other time points.
Organic acid metabolism of plum fruits
Contents of organic acid components
In comparison to CK, MT treatment decreased the con -
tent of malic acid in plum fruits by 6.45% at 28 d after 
treatment, while did not affect this parameter at other 
treatment times (Fig.  5). Additionally, the application of 
MT resulted in higher levels of quinic acid after 7 and 
21 d, lower levels after 28 d, and no significant change 
after 14 d. Moreover, when compared to the CK treat -
ment, MT treatment led to a 59.76%, 25.79%, 25.60%, and 
14.71% increase in citric acid content after 7, 14, 21, and 
28 d of treatment. MT treatment did not affect the con -
tents of oxalic acid and α-ketoglutaric acid. Furthermore, 
at 21 and 28 d after treatment, the content of tartaric 
acid increased by 36.14% and 24.42% with MT treatment 
compared to CK, respectively, but there was no effect on 
this parameter at 7 and 14 days after treatment.
Activities of organic acid metabolism enzymes
In comparison to CK, MT treatment resulted in a 58.50% 
increase in the activity of NAD +-MDH at 7 d after treat -
ment, a 7.42% decrease at 28 d after treatment, and no 
significant effect at 14 and 21 d after treatment (Fig.  6). 
Additionally, MT treatment led to a 72.28% and 35.43% 
increase in the activity of NADP +-ME at 7 and 28 d after 
treatment, a 21.98% decrease at 14 d after treatment, and 
no change at 21 d after treatment compared to CK. In 
terms of the activity of PEPC, MT treatment only showed 
a decrease at 7 d after treatment and had no impact at 14, 
21, and 28 d after treatment.
Transcriptome sequencing analysis
Analysis of soluble sugar and organic acid metabolisms 
genes
The metabolism of soluble sugars and organic acids in 
plum fruits showed more noticeable differences at 21 and 
28 d after treatment. These specific time points were cho-
sen for transcriptome sequencing. The report by Li et al. 
(2023) [32] provides the details regarding the number of 
DEGs in MT vs. CK at 21 and 28 d after treatment.

Xiao et al. BMC Plant Biology          (2024) 24:1208 
At 21 d after treatment, there were 13 DEGs in MT 
vs. CK associated with soluble sugar metabolism. These 
genes were enriched for starch and sucrose metabolism, 
galactose metabolism, fructose and mannose metabo -
lism, and glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, and pentose phos -
phate metabolism (Table  2; Fig.  7). In the starch and 
sucrose metabolic pathway, the expression levels of three 
β-1,3-glucan endonuclease  genes were up-regulated, 
along with the expression level of hexokinase 3  ( HK3). 
Within the glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathway, the 
expression levels of 6-phosphofructokinase 3  ( PFK3) 
and glucokinase ( GK) were up-regulated. Notably, HK3 
and PFK3 were also involved in the fructose and man -
nose metabolism pathway. Additionally, the expression 
level of glycosyltransferase (UGT73C2) was up-regulated, 
while the expression levels of two glycosyltransferase 
(UGT86A1 and UGT74G1) genes were down-regulated. 
Furthermore, three DEGs related to soluble sugar and 
organic acid transports were identified. The expression 
level of soluble sugar transporter protein (SWEET17) was 
down-regulated and the expression level of aluminum-
activated malate transporter protein 2  (ALMT2) was up-
regulated, while the expression level of polyol transporter 
protein (PLT5) was down-regulated. In the ascorbate and 
acetaldehyde metabolic pathway, the expression level of 
ascorbic acid oxidase (AAO) was up-regulated.
At 28 d after treatment, 20 DGEs in MT vs. CK were 
associated with soluble sugar metabolism. These DGEs 
were enriched for pathways including starch and sucrose 
metabolism, galactose metabolism, fructose and man -
nose metabolism, as well as glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, 
and pentose phosphate metabolism (Table 3; Fig. 7). Spe-
cifically, in the starch and sucrose metabolic pathway, 
the expression levels of four β-glucosidase genes and one 
β-furanofructosidase gene were up-regulated. In the fruc-
tose and mannose metabolism, as well as glycolysis and 
gluconeogenesis pathways, the expression level of fruc-
tose bisphosphate aldolas e ( FBA) was up-regulated, and 
the expression level of pyruvate decarboxylase  ( PDC) 
was down-regulated. In the pentose phosphate pathway, 
the expression level of GK was down-regulated, while 
the expression level of SWEET2a was up-regulated. The 
expression levels of sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) and 
phosphofructokinase (PFK) treated with MT were higher 
than CK. In addition, there were four DEGs related to 
malate metabolism in MT vs. CK. The expression levels 
of two malate dehydrogenase (MDH) genes and ALMT2 
were down-regulated, while the expression level of

vesicular membrane dicarboxylic acid transporter protein 
(TDT) was up-regulated. In the ascorbate and acetalde -
hyde metabolic pathway, the expression levels of three 
AAO genes were down-regulated.
DEGs expression levels of qRT-PCR and RNA-Seq
Four DEGs in MT vs. CK were screened for qRT-PCR 
validation at 21 and 28 d after treatment, respectively 
(Fig. 8). The expression levels of these DEGs in qRT-PCR 
were consistent with the RNA-Seq results in MT vs. CK. 
At 21 d after treatment, the expression levels of HK3, GK,

Discussion
Effects of MT on fruit quality
MT can enhance the transcription of genes involved in 
chlorophyll synthesis, PSI and PSII, and antioxidant 
enzymes, while reducing the expression of genes associ -
ated with chlorophyll breakdown, resulting in improved 
photosynthesis in plants [ 34]. The application of MT has 
been demonstrated to elevate the net photosynthetic 
rate, transpiration rate, and stomatal conductance in

strawberry leaves, leading to enhanced photosynthesis 
and increased individual fruit weight in strawberries [35]. 
In this experiment, MT treatment increased the trans -
verse diameter and single fruit weight of plum fruits. 
These results align with the results of previous stud -
ies [ 17, 18], indicating that MT treatment may improve 
photosynthesis in the leaves of plum trees and promote 
the accumulation of nutrients to be transferred to fruits. 
Total soluble solids, soluble sugars, and titratable acid 
are important indicators for fruit quality [ 1]. Previous 
studies have shown that MT treatment can increase the 
contents of total soluble solids and soluble sugar and 
decrease the content of organic acid in fruits [ 19–22]. In 
this study, MT treatment increased the contents of total 
soluble solids and soluble sugars and decreased the con -
tent of titratable acid in plum fruits at the mature stage. 
This outcome was in line with prior research [ 25], indi-
cating that MT treatment can enhance soluble sugar 
accumulation and reduce organic acid accumulation in 
plum fruits, thus improving the quality of fruits. Addi -
tionally, at later treatment stages, The levels of sucrose 
and sorbitol in plum fruits were found to increase with 
MT treatment, mirroring the findings in a study on pear 
fruits [ 19], but not consistent with the study of pome -
granate fruits [ 21]. This discrepancy may be due to the 
different major soluble sugar components in fruits of var-
ious species. Furthermore, malic acid was found to be the 
main organic acid component in plum fruits, followed by 
quinic acid, citric acid, and tartaric acid. At later treat -
ment stages, MT treatment decreased the contents of 
malic acid, quinic acid, and tartaric acid, and increased 
the contents of citric acid and vitamin C in plum fruits, 
resulting in a decrease in the titratable acid content, sim -
ilar to the results observed in grapes and tomatoes [ 36, 
37]. Therefore, MT treatment can improve the quality of 
plum fruits.

Effects of MT on soluble sugar metabolism and related 
genes in fruits
Soluble sugar accumulation in fruits is primarily affected 
by ‘bank’ strength, with the key indicator being the sugar 
metabolism enzymes activities [ 38]. MT treatment 
resulted in an increase in SPS activity in plum fruits at 
later stages in this study, with no noticeable impact on NI 
activity, similar to the results seen in tomatoes [39]. Addi-
tionally, MT treatment increased the SS-c enzyme activ -
ity of plum fruits at later stages after treatment, with no 
significant effect on the SS-s activity. However, the SS-s 
activity was notably higher than SS-c, indicating that the 
synthetic direction enzyme activity of SS played a signifi -
cant role. Further, MT treatment decreased the activities 
of S-AI and CWINV, resulting in a lower rate of sucrose 
conversion, while increasing the SPS activity led to a 
higher rate of sucrose synthesis. The combined effects of 
SPS, S-AI, and CWINV led to a decrease in fruit sucrose 
content consumption and an increase in accumulation. 
Transcriptome analysis revealed an up-regulation of the 
sucrose synthase gene SPS1 at a later stage after treat -
ment, aligning with the trend of increased SPS activity. 
This finding is consistent with results seen in pear fruits 
[19]. In contrast to findings in grapes [ 40], MT treatment 
increased the activities of AI, NI, and SS-c in plums, pro -
moting the conversion of sucrose to glucose and fructose. 
This difference may be attributed to plums and pears 
being sucrose-accumulating fruits, while grapes are hex -
ose-accumulating fruits [41].

Research has indicated that fructose phosphate kinase 
is the enzyme that limits the rate of the glycolytic path -
way [ 42]. In lychee pulp, phosphofructokinase activity 
was reduced and PFK expression was down-regulated, 
leading to inhibition of the glycolytic pathway and the 
accumulation of fructose and glucose in the pulp [ 43]. In 
this experiment, at 21 d after treatment, MT treatment 
increased PFK activity and up-regulated the expression 
level of PFK3 in plum fruit. This promoted the entry of 
hexose into the glycolysis and pentose phosphate path -
way. MT treatment also increased GK activity in plum 
fruit, facilitating the decomposition of glucose and fruc -
tose. At 28 d after treatment, MT treatment resulted in 
an increase of FK activity and decrease of NAD +-SDH, 
S-AI, and CWINV activities in plum fruits. This pro -
moted the catabolic conversion of fructose, reduced the 
rate of fructose production, and decreased the accumula -
tion of fructose in fruits, consistent with previous studies 
[44]. In addition, MT treatment resulted in an increase of 
GK and SOX activities in plum fruits at 28 d after treat -
ment, promoting both glucose catabolism and gluconeo -
genesis and keeping glucose levels relatively stable in the 
fruits. This may explain the non-significant difference 
in glucose content between MT-treated fruits and the 
control.
The SWEET family is a group of protein genes primar -
ily responsible for sugar transport within cells, which can 
transport sucrose or hexose down concentration gra -
dients, and these sugar transport proteins play a crucial 
role in fruit sugar accumulation [ 45]. Previous studies 
have shown that SWEET17 acts as a fructose transporter 
in citrus fruits [ 46], while SlSWEET17, found in the 
vesicle membrane of tomato fruits, functions as a bidi -
rectional fructose transporter [ 45]. In this experiment, 
the expression level of SWEET17 was down-regulated in 
plum fruits 21 d after treatment, with no significant dif -
ference in fructose content between the treatment and 
control groups. At 28 d after treatment, MT treatment 
increased the activity of FK in plum fruits, facilitating the 
conversion of fructose to fructose 6-phosphate, resulting 
in a significant decrease in fructose content. Meanwhile, 
MT treatment up-regulated the expression of SWEET2a 
and increased the sucrose content in plum fruits, in 
line with previous studies in grapes [ 47]. Therefore, it is 
hypothesized that SWEET2a and SWEET17 play a role 
in the transmembrane transport process of fructose and 
sucrose within plum fruit cells, ultimately impacting 
sugar content within the fruit vesicles.
Effects of MT on organic acid metabolism and related 
genes in fruits
In this experiment, the NAD +-MDH activity was found 
to be higher than the PEPC activity in plum fruits at dif -
ferent treatment times, indicating that NAD +-MDH 
played a dominant role in the synthesis of malic acid. 
During the early stages of treatment, the NAD +-MDH 
activity gradually increased, contributing to the synthe -
sis of malic acid to support the tricarboxylic acid cycle

and provide energy for fruit development [ 48]. How -
ever, at 28 d after treatment, the MT treatment resulted 
in a decrease in NAD +-MDH activity and an increase in 
NADP+-ME activity. This shift led to the decomposition 
of malic acid in the fruits, consequently reducing the 
malic acid content [ 49]. Transcriptome analysis revealed 
that the expression level of MDH was down-regulated at 
28 d after treatment, aligning with the decrease in malate 
dehydrogenase activity. This discovery aligns with earlier 
studies conducted on apples [ 49], suggesting that MDH 
plays a regulatory role in malate synthesis in plum fruits.

ALMT2 belongs to the ALMT family of homologous 
genes, and the ALMT family is involved in the trans -
port of various organic acids [ 50]. In this experiment, 
MT treatment down-regulated the expression levels of 
ALMT2 at 28 d after treatment, was consistent with the 
trend of the decrease in malic acid content, indicating 
that ALMT2 may be involved in the transport of malic 
acid in fruit cells. Meanwhile, MT treatment up-regu -
lated the expression levels of malate transport related 
gene TDT. The previous study showed the high expres -
sion level of TDT1 in pear fruits promoted its accumula -
tion of malic acid content [ 51], and the expression levels 
of tDT-like (a TDT homologous gene) had a positive asso-
ciation with malic acid content in plum fruits [ 52]. The 
expression level of PstDT had a positive correlation 
with the content of citric acid in plum fruits [ 53]. In this 
experiment, MT treatment up-regulated the expression 
level of TDT and increased the citric acid content, while 
decreased the malic acid content at 28 d after treatment. 
This may be due to the fact that the amount of malic acid 
accumulated in plum fruits depended on the effects of 
the integrated regulation of several genes such as malic 
acid synthesis and degradation related genes, as well as 
malic acid transport related transporter proteins, ion 
channel genes, etc., and the changes in the malic acid 
content could not be explained by the changes in one or 
two genes only [52].
Conclusion
MT treatment improves fruit quality, increases the sol -
uble sugar content, and decreases the organic acid con -
tent of plum fruits. At 21 d after treatment, a total of 13 
DEGs are related to sugar metabolism, along with one 
DEG related to malic acid transport. Among these DEGs, 
the expression levels of HK3, PFK3, GK, and ALMT2 are 
up-regulated. At 28 d after treatment, total of 20 DEGs 
are associated with sugar metabolism, and four DEGs 
are linked to malate metabolism and transport. In MT 
treated plum fruits, the expression levels of SWEET2a, 
FBA, and TDT are up-regulated, while the expression lev-
els of GK, ALMT2, and MDH are down-regulated. Future 
study should focus on verifying the functions of these 
genes and elucidating their molecular mechanisms and 
regulatory networks.
