3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3HP), an important three carbon (C3) chemical, is designated as
one of the top platform chemicals with an urgent need for improved industrial production.
Halomonas bluephagenesis shows the potential as a chassis for competitive bioproduction of
various chemicals due to its ability to grow under an open, unsterile and continuous process.
Here, we report the strategy for producing 3HP and its copolymer poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-
co-3-hydroxypropionate) (P3HB3HP) by the development of H. bluephagenesis. The tran-
scriptome analysis reveals its 3HP degradation and synthesis pathways involving endogenous
synthetic enzymes from 1,3-propanediol. Combing the optimized expression of aldehyde
dehydrogenase (AldD
Hb), an engineeredH. bluephagenesis strain of whose 3HP degradation
pathway is deleted and that overexpresses alcohol dehydrogenases (AdhP) on its genome
under a balanced redox state, is constructed with an enhanced 1.3-propanediol-dependent
3HP biosynthetic pathway to produce 154 g L
−1 of 3HP with a yield and productivity of
0.93 g g−1 1,3-propanediol and 2.4 g L−1 h−1, respectively. Moreover, the strain could also
accumulate 60% poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-32– 45% 3-hydroxypropionate) in the dry cell
mass, demonstrating to be a suitable chassis for hyperproduction of 3HP and P3HB3HP.

-Hydroxypropionic acid (3HP) is a platform chemical for
the synthesis of C3-based chemicals, including acrylic
acid, malonic acid, acrylamide, acrylonitrile (ACN), and
poly(3-hydroxypropionate) (P3HP) based polymers 1–4.T h e
chemical synthesis of 3HP is not suitable for industrial pro-
duction owing to the high cost of the precursors and processes,
and environmental incompatibility 5. Since biosynthesis is sus-
tainable and environmental friendly, it is considered a better
choice for improved 3HP industrial production. Synthetic
pathways were designed for producing 3HP from bio-renewable
sources such as glucose, glycerol, or CO 26–9. However, its
biosynthesis has been reported to have poor productivity 6.
Glucose utilizing pathways based on malonyl-CoA orβ-alanine
has been constructed for 3HP production 10–12,b u tt h ec o m -
plexity of manipulating and regulating multiple genes has
proven to be a challenge for enhanced 3HP production 13.
Instead, glycerol, a byproduct of biodiesel, is more favorable.
The glycerol to 3HP pathway involves glycerol dehydratase
(GDHt) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), converting
glycerol to 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde and then 3HP,
respectively 14,15.
Traditional microbial chassis such asEscherichia coli or Cor-
ynebacterium glutamicum were reported to have the ﬁnal 3HP
concentration of approximately 70 g L−1 16,17. Klebsiella pneumo-
niae, which naturally produces vitamin B12 as a cofactor of GDHt,
showed the highest production of 82 g L−1 3HP18–20. However, a
larger-scale production usingK. pneumoniaewas impossible because
it is been known as an opportunity pathogen13. Therefore, to
enhance the production of 3HP, we need to develop a more suitable
producer as the chassis. Another issue occurs during the production
of 3HP: under an aerobic condition, GDHt is deactivated combined
with a downregulated expression of vitamin B1221, while under
anaerobic condition, cells were grown poorly, and NAD +,a
n e c e s s a r yc o f a c t o ro fA L D H ,h a sd i fﬁculty to regenerate21–24.T h e
trade-off between vitamin B12 synthesis and NAD+ regeneration
controls 3HP production and the key is the balance of dissolved
oxygen in the cultures23. Pure 1,3-propanediol (PDO), obtainable
from microbial process (1$ kg−1 on www.alibaba.com, unpuriﬁed
1,3-propanediol should have a much lower price), is a monomer
of a high-performed textile material, poly(1,3-trimethylene ter-
ephthalate) (PTT)25. Using 1.3-propanediol as the substrate may be
a possible solution26–28, as 1,3-propanediol can also be converted
into 3HP using 1,3-propanediol oxidoreductase (PDOR) and
ALDH27.T h et w oN A D+-dependent enzymes PDOR and ALDH
function well under aerobic conditions without vitamin B1221.A sa n
example, Gluconobacter oxydanswas reported to produce 45 g L−1
3HP using these two enzymes27. These results paved the way by
using 1,3-propanediol as the carbon source to produce 3HP.
Halophilic Halomonas spp. have attracted attentions from
industrial biotechnology researchers29. They are capable of grow-
ing at high concentrations of NaCl and alkaline pH, thus, avoiding
possible contamination by other microorganisms even under open
unsterile conditions30. As a result, Halomonas spp.-based fer-
mentations have reduced cost and complexity31,32. Pilot-scale fer-
mentations using seawater-based artiﬁcial media under open and
continuous conditions were conducted without contamination
over a long period of two months32. Moreover, several synthetic
biology and chromosome engineering methods such as CRISPR/
Cas9 have been successfully applied inHalomonas spp., turning
them into a more suitable chassis for future metabolic engineering
and genome editing 33,34. Next generation of industrial bio-
technology (NGIB) has been developed based on extremophile
Halomonas spp., allowing the production to be conducted under
open, unsterile, and continuous process conditions with reduced
fresh water and energy consumption, aiming for increasing eco-
nomic competitiveness of current industrial biotechnology29,35,36.
Halomonas bluephagenesis TD (once termed Halomonas sp.
TD01) is a halophile isolated from Aydingol Lake in Xinjiang
Province/China, has been used as a chassis for the production
of several bioplastic polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), including
poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB ), poly(3-hydroxybutyrate- co-4-
hydroxybutyrate) (P3HB4HB) and poly(3-hydroxybutyrate- co-
3 - h y d r o x y v a l e r a t e )( P H B V )using various engineering
approaches 37–40. H. bluephagenesis is capable of growing at
NaCl concentrations of 20 –150 g L−1 with an optimal con-
centration of 40 –60 g L−1. The strain can be grown at a pH
ranging 5.0–11.0, the optimum of which is 8.5–9.0. However, as
a promising biosynthetic chassis, H. bluephagenesis should
further expand its product diversity to create more industrial
value41. The unique growth condition of high osmotic pressure
for H. bluephagenesis is beneﬁcial for producing organic acid at
a high concentration35. The organic acids produced are in the
form of sodium salt under alkal ine culture conditions, pre-
venting the formation of toxic undissociated organic acids
during production42,43. It is therefore reasonable to expect that
H. bluephagenesis can be a suitable organic acid producer such
as 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3HP).
Here, we show that a coherent bioprocess based on halophilic
H. bluephagenesis for production of 3HP and its copolymer poly
(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxypropionate) (P3HB3HP) by
identifying and deleting 3HP degradation pathway, screening and
optimizing endogenous biosynthetic enzymes, engineering
genomic expression of 3HP synthesis pathway and balancing
redox states. The engineeredH. bluephagenesis strain produces a
higher titer of 3HP with 1,3-propanediol as a carbon source under
open and unsterile fed-batch fermentation.
Results
Identiﬁcation of 3HP degradation pathway inH. bluephagenesis.
Due to the high osmotic pressure tolerance,H. bluephagenesisis an
ideal chassis for the extracellular production of small molecules
with a high concentration in the cultures. The extracellular 3HP
tolerance has been demonstrated by H. bluephagenesis,f u r t h e r
proving its potential as a microbial industrial chassis for 3HP
(Supplementary Fig. 1). To verify the feasibility of 3HP production
by H. bluephagenesis,g e n e sdhaTPp and aldDPp from Pseudomonas
putida KT2440 encoding 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase and
aldehyde dehydrogenase, were constructed in plasmid p30 and
overexpressed inE. coli S17-1 and H. bluephagenesis, respectively
(Fig. 1a). The recombinantE. coliS17-1 (p30) produced 1.5 g L−1
and H. bluephagenesis(p30) produced 0.2 g L−1 3HP when grown
in conical ﬂasks. The former strain was cultured in LB medium
supplemented with 30 g L−1 glucose and 10 g L−1 1,3-propanediol,
and the latter was grown in the deﬁned minimal medium sup-
plemented with 30 g L−1 glucose and 10 g L−1 1,3-propanediol
(Fig. 1b). Recombinant H. bluephagenesis (p30) accumulated
0.5 g L−1 PHB when 5 g L−1 3HP was added as the sole carbon
source (Fig.1c). The 3HP may be degraded to acetyl-coA for cell
growth and PHB accumulation, indicating thatH. bluephagenesisis
able to utilize 3HP as a carbon source (Fig.1a). This result suggests
that H. bluephagenesiscontains a 3HP degradation pathway.
To investigate the key genes in the 3HP degradation pathway,
transcriptome analysis ofH. bluephagenesiswas performed using
the cells grown under culture conditions with and without 3HP as
the carbon source, respectively. A volcano plot illustrates the
distribution of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) (Fig. 1d).
Overall, when 3HP was used as the sole carbon source for growth,
384 genes in the cells were upregulated while 210 were
downregulated compared with glucose utilized as a sole carbon
source (Fig. 1d and Supplementary Data 2). Possibly similar to
the catabolic operons, the addition of 3HP could activate its

degradation pathway. Several putative upregulated dehydro-
genases were thus selected for qRT-PCR veri ﬁcation. Among
them, GME_RS01260 encoding choline dehydrogenase (RefSeq.
Accession: WP_009721523) and GME_RS01255 encoding CoA-
acylating methylmalonate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (RefSeq.
Accession WP_009721522), were upregulated by 119-folds and
116-folds, respectively (Fig.1d). Choline dehydrogenase is named
DddA due to its high homology with the DddA ofHalomonas sp.
HTNK144 (Fig. 1a). Deletions of putative 3-hydroxypropionate
dehydrogenase (HpdH) and putative 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehy-
drogenase (HbdH-4) in Pseudomonas denitriﬁcans eliminate its
ability to degrade 3HP 45–47. Cell growth was found to be
unaffected while 3HP could no longer be utilized as the sole
carbon source after thedddA deletion (Supplementary Figs. 2 and
3). The dddA gene deletion in recombinant H. bluephagenesis
TDΔdddA (p30) could increase the production with 2.7 g L−1
3HP and 0.7 g L−1 PHB when grown in conicalﬂasks (Fig. 1e).
The toxicity of 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3HPA), an inter-
mediate for 3HP biosynthesis, negatively affects cell growth and
3HP production. Expression modules were designed to prevent
the possible intracellular accumulation of 3HPA using optimized
promoter, ribosome binding site (RBS) sequence ofaldDPp, and
shifting the order ofaldDPp and dhaTPp operon (Supplementary
Fig. 4a). Plasmid p31 was constructed replacing the original RBS
with a stronger one; p32 contains changing order ofaldDPp and
dhaTPp operon; p33 and p34 based on p32 were constructed with
a stronger RBS and promoter, respectively.
qRT-PCR was performed to further con ﬁrm the enhanced
expression level of aldDPp gene under the PPorin promoter48.
Recombinant strains were cultured in conicalﬂasks and grown
for 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h, respectively. The results showed that
the expression level of aldDPp in H. bluephagenesis TDΔdddA
harboring p34 was higher compared to that ofH. bluephagenesis
TDΔdddA (p32) during the early growth phase, whereas an
opposite trend was revealed at the late growth period (Supple-
mentary Fig. 4b). However, the enzyme activity of AldDPp was
observed to decrease over time, while the activity of DhaTPp has
shown an increase up to 24 hours (Supplementary Fig. 5).
Additionally, we compared the enzyme activity of AldDPp in
recombinant H. bluephagenesis TDΔdddA harboring p32-p34
deleted with dhaTPp gene. The activity of AldDPp was increased
using the optimized promoter or ribosome binding site (RBS)
sequence ofaldDPp, even though the yield of 3HP did not increase
signiﬁcantly (Supplementary Fig. 6a, b). In general, manipulation

of aldDPp expression level showed no enhancement on 3HP
production (Supplementary Fig. 6a). This may be due to the low
activity of DhaTPp, which leads to the weak production of toxic
3HPA intermediate. Hence, even though the poor expression of
aldD
Pp, it was enough for consuming the produced 3HPA and
avoiding its accumulation. It was also shown that the speciﬁc
activity of DhaT Pp was lower than that of 1,3-propanediol
oxidoreductase (DhaTKp)i nKlebsiella pneumoniaeDSM 2026 as
reported49 (Supplementary Fig. 6c), indicating an insuf ﬁcient
supply of 3HPA, which limits 3HP biosynthesis. To develop
microbial cell factories for ef ﬁcient 3HP production, efﬁcient
enzyme systems must be constructed50.
Analysis of endogenous enzymes converting 1,3-propanediol to
3HP. A trace amount of 3HP was detected in the H. blue-
phagenesis TDΔdddA harboring the empty plasmid as a control,
indicating the existence of endogenous activity of native 3HP
synthetic enzymes inH. bluephagenesis (Fig. 1e). To analyze the
endogenous synthesis pathway of 3HP, a protein homologous to
the aldehyde dehydrogenase AldD Pp was found via in silico
analysis of the genome sequence ofH. bluephagenesis, namely,
GME_RS00360, which was annotated as the putativealdDHb gene
encoding a 506-amino-acid polypeptide. An overall 80% amino
acid identity was shown between AldDHb (RefSeq. Accession:
WP_009721344) and the AldDPp from P. putida KT2440 after
BLAST analysis.
Subsequently, an transcriptome analysis ofH. bluephagenesis
was performed using cells grown with or without 1,3-propanediol
in culture media containing 30 g L−1 glucose to investigate
alcohol dehydrogenases in H. bluephagenesis. The volcano plot
illustrates the distribution of differentially expressed genes
(DEGs) (Fig. 2a). Overall, 292 genes were upregulated while
285 were downregulated in the presence of 1,3-propanediol in
the cultures (Fig.2a and Supplementary Data 3). Several putative
upregulated alcohol dehydrogenases were examined, including
GME_RS01345, GME_05160, GME_RS01585and GME_RS00365
encoding NAD(P)-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase (RefSeq.
Accession: WP_009721539.1), zinc-binding alcohol dehydrogen-
ase (GenBank Accession: EGP20677.1), zinc-binding dehydro-
genase (RefSeq. Accession: WP_009721587.1), and alcohol
dehydrogenase AdhP (RefSeq. Accession: WP_039868491.1),
respectively (Fig. 2b).
In order to overexpress the mentioned genes encoding
putative alcohol dehydrogenase s, four related plasmids were
constructed combined with the genealdDHb encoding aldehyde
dehydrogenase, and H. bluephagenesis TDΔdddA was trans-
formed using the resulting plasmids, respectively (Fig.2b). The
result showed only one strain harboring GME_RS00365 gene
adhP was able to produce 3.3 g L−1 3HP (Fig. 2b). Thus, the
gene adhP was identi ﬁed to encode the 1,3-propanediol
dehydrogenase with relatively high activity to convert 1,3-
propanediol to 3HP.
An expression module, which does not hamper the cell growth
during the 3HP production, was designed by optimizing the
expression levels of aldDHb encoding aldehyde dehydrogenase
(Fig. 2c). The H. bluephagenesis TDΔdddA harboring p59
equipped with a stronger RBS and p60 with a stronger promoter,
respectively, achieved a higher yield of ~7 g L−1 3HP, compared
to the control H. bluephagenesis TDΔdddA harboring p58
without a stronger promoter or RBS (Fig. 2c). Moreover,
polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) contents produced by H. blue-
phagenesis TDΔdddA (p58), H. bluephagenesis TDΔdddA (p59)
and H. bluephagenesis TDΔdddA (p60) were similar (Fig. 2d).
The above results demonstrated that the aldDHb upregulated
expression level could enhance 3HP production. In addition, we
compared the enzyme activity of AldDHb in the recombinantH.
bluephagenesis TDΔdddA harboring p58, p59 or p60 deleted with
the adhP gene (Fig.2e). Consistent with the signiﬁcant increase of
3HP yield, the enzyme activity of AldD Hb was signiﬁcantly
increased by optimizing the promoter or ribosome binding site
(RBS) sequence of aldDPp (Fig. 2e). Since 1,3-propanediol was
almost completely consumed while glucose was still available at
48 h of cultivation when 30 g L−1 glucose and 10 g L−1 1,3-
propanediol were added to cultures, a higherﬁnal 3HP titer is
expected when there are more 1,3-propanediol and less glucose
(Supplementary Fig. 7).
Selection of efﬁcient enzymes for biosynthesis of 3HP inH.
bluephagenesis. With the successful establishment of 3HP pro-
duction platform based on H. bluephagenesis, 3HP production
needed further improvement. The 3HP biosynthetic pathway
from 1,3-propanediol comprises two parts, including the forma-
tion of 3HPA and subsequent conversion of 3HPA to 3HP
(Fig. 1a). To select the efﬁcient enzyme combinations for the 3HP
production via 1,3-propanediol oxidoreductase and aldehyde
dehydrogenase, different plasmids were constructed to express
variants of different pathway components. Speciﬁcally, aldehyde
dehydrogenase AldH (RefSeq. Accession: WP_001009090.1) ofE.
coli MG1655, 1,3-propanediol oxidoreductase DhaTKp (GenBank
AAP97875.1) and aldehyde dehydrogenase PuuC (RefSeq.
Accession: WP_004224052.1) of K. pneumoniae were selected
(Fig. 3a)49,51,52. In the enzyme-screening process, weﬁrst com-
pared the ef ﬁciency of the selected 1,3-propanediol oxidor-
eductase encoding genes in combination withaldDHb (plasmids
p90 and p95). With the co-overexpression ofadhP, the resultant
strain H. bluephagenesis TDΔdddA (p90) was shown to have the
highest 3HP production (Fig. 3b). Subsequently, the selected
aldehyde dehydrogenases encoding genes were evaluated based
on adhP (plasmids p91, p99, and p100). ThealdDHb still out-
performed its counterparts, producing 3HP at a titer of 7.8 g L−1
(H. bluephagenesis TDΔdddA (p91), Fig. 3c). However, H. blue-
phagenesis TDΔdddA (p105) containing theK. pneumoniaePuuC
combination withK. pneumoniaeDhaTKp only generated 3HP at
a titer of 2 g L−1 (Supplementary Fig. 8a).
Enzyme activities in the recombinant H. bluephagenesis
TDΔdddA overexpressing the three different alcohol dehydro-
genases (AdhP, DhaT Pp, and DhaT Kp) and four different
aldehyde dehydrogenases (AldDHb, AldDPp, AldH, and PuuC)
were analyzed using their corresponding puri ﬁed enzymes,
respectively (Fig. 3a). The His-tagged enzymes were puriﬁed to
electrophoretic homogeneity (Supplementary Fig. 9). For the
oxidative activity, the speciﬁc activity of AdhP was found to be
~7.0 U mg−1, higher than the alcohol dehydrogenase ofP. putida
DhaTPp and K. pneumoniae DhaTKp (Fig. 3d). The aldehyde
dehydrogenase enzyme is in general presented as a tetramer. Its C
terminus has been known to play an important role in the
assembly, and thus a His-tag was introduced to the N terminus.
However, the production of 3HP was signiﬁcantly reduced when
the His-tag was introduced to the N terminus of AldD Hb
(Supplementary Fig. 8b). Thus, we introduced the His-tag to
the C terminus of AldD
Hb. The speciﬁc activity of AldDHb was
~3.7 U mg−1, the highest among all the aldehyde dehydrogenases
(Fig. 3e). The AdhP and AldDHb enzymes kinetic properties of
Kcat and Km were characterized (Table 1). The half-saturation
constant (Km) of AldDHb was low at 0.05 mM, indicating that the
AldDHb has a very high afﬁnity for the substrate 3HPA, and the
catalytic efﬁciency (kcat/Km) of the AldDHb was 100 times higher
than that of PuuC at the same condition (Supplementary Table 3).
Thus, AldDHb and AdhP were considered as the efﬁcient enzymes
for biosynthesis of 3HP byH. bluephagenesis.

Combinatorial optimization for increasing the production of
3HP. To stabilize microbial production, it is critical to obtain
stable gene expressions inH. bluephagenesis. This is commonly
accomplished via genomic integration of genes of interest. To
efﬁciently manipulate relevant genes, a marker-free CRISPR/Cas9
genome-editing technology was employed33, allowing the con-
struction of a 3HP biosynthetic pathway for genome integration
(Fig. 4a). The best-performing gene combination, aldDHb with
adhP containing promoter of phaCAB operon from Ralstonia
eutropha H16 and a stronger RBS, were integrated into the
chromosome of H. bluephagenesis for evaluation on 3HP pro-
duction (Fig. 4a). The genomic integration of the 3HP biosyn-
thetic pathway does not negatively impact cell growth
(Supplementary Fig. 10). As a result, a signiﬁcant increase of 3HP
production was observed in recombinantH. bluephagenesisTD22
and H. bluephagenesis TD27 containing intact PHB production
pathway when compared with its PHB synthesis operonphaCAB
deleted strains H. bluephagenesis TD17 and H. bluephagenesis
TD25, respectively, indicating that the PHB accumulation could
promote 3HP synthesis. Moreover, H. bluephagenesis TD27
harboring genome-expressing 3HP endogenous synthetic path-
way produced ~9 g L−1 3HP, slightly higher than that synthesized
by the plasmid-expressing H. bluephagenesis TDΔdddA (p59).
Therefore, H. bluephagenesisTD27 was taken as the platform for
further enhanced 3HP production from 1,3-propanediol (Fig.4b).
1 M 3HP can be generated from 1 M 1,3-propanediol, accom-
panied by the generation of 2 M NADH (Fig.1a). However, an
abnormal increase of NADH could lead to cell injury, reduced
glycolysis, and TCA cycle53. It has been reported that surplus
NADH can be used for the reductive metabolism of acetic acid to
ethanol in someClostridium species54. Acetate is a cost-effective
carbon source, which can be obtained from carbon dioxide and
hydrolysis or pyrolysis of lignocellulosic biomass like corn stover.

−1)w e r ec o -
fed to the culture medium ofH. bluephagenesisTD27 with 20 g L−1
glucose and 20 g L−1 1,3-propanediol, respectively (Fig. 4c).
The addition of 3 g L−1 acetic acid enhanced 3HP production to
8.6 g L−1 in shake-ﬂask studies, representing a 35% increase
compared to cultures in the absence of acetic acid. As a result,

(PHB/DCM) increased 108 and 455%, respectively. The addition of
6gL −1 acetic acid resulted in the highest 3HP, dry cell weight
(DCM), and PHB content, reaching approximately 9.3 g L−1 3HP,
8gL −1 DCM, and 40% PHB/DCM (Fig. 4c). The addition of
6gL −1 acetic acid also resulted in a 1.5-fold increase in a
total amount of NAD+ and NADH and twofold increase in
NAD+/NADH ratio compared with the result of 0 g L−1 acetic acid
(Supplementary Fig. 11). Since PhaB of H. bluephagenesis is
dependent on NADH for PHB synthesis, the synthesis of PHB
consumes NADH55. The supply of acetic acid can increase acetyl-
CoA pool. The excess NADH resulted from 3HP formation via 1,3-
propanediol oxidation can be balanced by accelerating PHB
synthesis via a larger acetyl-CoA pool, this improves not only the
PHB synthesis but also glycolysis, TCA cycle, and 3HP synthesis
(Supplementary Fig. 12). Therefore,L-aspartate as the precursor
for the de novo biosynthesis of NAD+ was possibly improved. As
a result, both the total amount of NAD+, NADH, and the NAD+/
NADH ratio were increased.
The pH in the cultures decreased from 9 to 5–6 after 24 h
cultivation as the increase of 3HP in shake-ﬂask inhibits cell
growth and 3HP production. To stabilize pH above 7 after 24 h
cultivation via improving the buffer capacity in the medium, the
phosphate buffer was changed to 1.4% K2HPO4·3H2O and 0.52%
KH2PO4 in a modiﬁed minimal medium. This generated 12 g L−1
3HP, 7 g L−1 DCM and 50% PHB/DCM fromH. bluephagenesis
TD27 grown in shake ﬂasks, this was comparable to that of
plasmid-expressing H. bluephagenesis TDΔdddA (p59) (Fig. 4d),
along with an over 90% conversion ratio of 1,3-propanediol to
3HP (Supplementary Fig. 13).
The glucose level should be reduced to allow the minimum
amount of glucose for ef ﬁcient production of 3HP. Gradient
concentrations of glucose (5, 10, 15, and 20 g L−1) were co-fed
with 20 or 30 g L−1 1,3-propanediol, respectively, to cultures ofH.
bluephagenesis TD27 (Fig.4e). The addition of 5 g L−1 glucose and
20 g L−1 1,3-propanediol resulted in ~18.9 g L−1 3HP, 7.8 g L−1
DCM, and 47% PHB/DCM (Fig.4e). In the presence of 5 g L−1
glucose and 20 g L−1 1,3-propanediol, 3.5 g L−1 residual 1,3-
propanediol together with 0.2 g L−1 acetic acid were found in the
culture together with less than 0.1 g L−1 residual glucose in the
cultures ofH. bluephagenesisTD27, indicating that the reduction
of glucose enhanced 3HP production (Supplementary Fig. 14). An
excess amount of NADH is formed during glycolysis and

glucose. The excessive NADH condition associated with 3HP
formation and glycolysis can in turn inhibit glycolysis and 3HP
synthesis (Supplementary Fig. 12). Thus, a reduced amount of
glucose may reduce the NADH produced by glycolysis during
3HP synthesis, resulting in more conversion of 1,3-propanediol
to 3HP.
E. coliand H. bluephagenesiswere transformed using plasmids
p30 and p59 expressing AldD Pp and DhaT Pp cloned from
P. putida KT2440, AldDHb and AdhP from H. bluephagenesis,
respectively. E. coli was cultured in a modiﬁed minimal medium
containing 1% NaCl, andH. bluephagenesis in another modiﬁed
minimal medium containing 6% NaCl. Recombinant E. coli
harboring alcohol dehydrogenase (AdhP) and aldehyde dehy-
drogenase (AldDHb) cloned from H. bluephagenesis produced
only 0.7 g L−1 3HP. In contrast, theH. bluephagenesisTDΔdddA
(p59) generated 11 g L−1 3HP compared to only 5 g L−1 3HP
secreted by H. bluephagenesis TDΔdddA (p30) harboring the
DhaTPp and AldDPp from P. putida KT2440 (Supplementary
Fig. 15).
To further enhance 3HP production, the fed-batch fermenta-
tion process was optimized employing various feeding strategies,
including continuous or intermittent feeding strategy during the
late period of growth. During the continuous feeding process, cell
growth was inhibited when 1,3-propanediol and glucose were fed
at 8 h. 60 g L−1 3HP with <30 g L−1 DCM were obtained from
cultures ofH. bluephagenesisTD27 (Supplementary Fig. 16). The
production of 3HP will convert a large amount of NAD+ into
NADH during the logarithmic growth phase, which changes the
redox balance. Excessive NADH generates feedback inhibition to
glycolysis, negatively affecting cellular catabolism and growth. In
addition, the enzyme activity of AldDHb was observed to decrease
over time, and the activity of AdhP was observed to increase up to
24 h (Supplementary Fig. 17). When 60 g L−1 1,3-propanediol
was added at 24, 28, and 32 h during fed-batch fermentation
process to separate cell growth and 3HP production, the
engineered H. bluephagenesis TD27 produced 154 g L−1 3HP
with a yield and productivity of 0.93 g g−1 1,3-propanediol and
2.4 g L−1 h−1, respectively (Fig.4f).
EngineeringH. bluephagenesisTD27 for productions of 3HP and
its copolymers. Polyhydroxybutyrate or poly-3-hydroxybutyrate
(PHB), is very brittle due to its high crystallinity that limits its
application. In contrast, poly-3-hydroxypropionate (P3HP) shows
good combined mechanical properties including an elongation at
break of more than 600% and Young′s modulus of 300 MPa–3
GPa56. The low melting temperatureTm of P3HP is <100 °C, which
limits its stability in a higher temperature environment. On the other
hand, theTm of PHB is high which can reach 176 °C. Thus, copo-
lymerization of 3HB and 3HP compensate for the weak properties

of each homopolymers57. Since recombinant H. bluephagenesis
produced 3HP efﬁciently, 3HP-related copolymers are expected to
be produced appropriately. It was reasonable to assume that ade-
quate 3HP-CoA and appropriate PhaC polymerase are essential for
the accumulation of copolyme r P3HB3HP consisting of 3-
hydroxybutyrate (3HB) and 3HP, given the PHB is natively syn-
thesized by H. bluephagenesis (Fig. 5a). To produce P3HB3HP,
coenzyme A ligase domain (Pcs) fromChloroﬂexus aurantiacus,
propionyl-CoA synthase (PrpE) fromE. coli, acetyl-CoA synthase
(AcoE) from Ralstonia entropha, and propionaldehyde dehy-
drogenase (PduP) fromSalmonella typhimurium, were selected to
generate 3HP-CoA from 3-hydroxypropionic acid and from 3-
hydroxypropionaldehyde, respectively. PhaC polymerase fromR.
entrophawas chosen for its strong 3HP polymerization ability when
expressed in other bacteria includingE. coli(Fig. 5a)58.
The strong 3HP producer H. bluephagenesis TD27 was then
transformed with the four constructs, and P3HB3HP was
successfully produced in 7 g L−1 DCM containing approximately
60% copolymer (Fig.5b). H. bluephagenesisTD27 overexpressing
Pcs and PhaC reached 45% 3HP molar ratio in the P3HB3HP
content. The extracellular 3HP yield increased gradually with the
increase of 1,3-propanediol concentration in the cell cultures. The
P3HB3HP content and P3HP monomer composition increased to
a maximum of 54 and 45%, respectively, when 12 g L−1 1,3-
propanediol was added to the cultures (Supplementary Fig. 18).
The glucose and 1,3-propanediol concentrations were optimized
to ﬁnd the minimum amount of glucose and 1,3-propanediol for
efﬁcient production of P3HB3HP. The P3HP molar ratios in
P3HB3HP were found to be between 32 and 40% when different
concentrations of 1,3-propanediol (2, 4, and 8 g L−1) were added,
respectively. The DCM and P3HB3HP content increased with
the increase of glucose concentration (Supplementary Fig. 19).
The fed-batch production of P3HB3HP allowed a 60% polymer
accumulation with the P3HP ratio reaching 40% in the
copolymers (Supplementary Fig. 20).
The composition of a P3HB3HP was studied using NMR
(Fig. 5c). Two characteristic peaks of P3HP atδ = 2.59–2.70 and
δ = 4.31–4.39 ppm (peaks 6 and 7) were identiﬁed, together with
three peaks of P3HB at δ = 1.24–1.33, δ = 2.47–2.56 and δ =
5.23–5.35 ppm (peaks 4, 2, and 3). The molar ratio of P3HP in
this copolymer has been shown can achieve approximately 40%
when calculated by integrating the areas of speciﬁc related signals.
Discussion
H. bluephagenesis and its recombinants have been demonstrated
to be economic chassis for reducing cost for bulk chemicals37.A
systematic metabolic engineering approach was taken to achieve
efﬁcient production by deleting the 3HP degradation pathway
combined with overexpression of DhaTPp and AldDPp proteins
from P. putidaKT2440 for 3HP production inH. bluephagenesis
grown in the presence of 1,3-propanediol (Fig. 1a). Moreover,
based on the RNA-seq data, theadhP and aldDHb genes were
chosen and overexpressed for enhanced catalytic activities toward

3HP during the fed-batch growth (Fig.4f).
Since 3HP based polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) polyesters
provide improved mechanical strengths for PHA59, it has become
an attractive idea to make 3HP based PHA. In this study,
P3HP3HB copolymer was produced based on the established
3HP synthesis pathway combined with overexpression ofpcs and
phaC, two heterologous genes (Fig.5a). The resulting P3HP3HB
copolymer contained a 45% P3HP molar ratio when fed with 1,3-
propanediol. The P3HP ratio also can be tuned from 32 to 40% by
varying the co-feeding concentrations of 1,3-propanediol and
glucose. For the ﬁrst time, engineered Halomonas sp. has been
employed to produce P3HB3HP.
The selected substrate 1,3-propanediol contributed to the high
3HP titer (Fig.1a). As mentioned above, 3HP production via
metabolic engineering started from 1,3-propanediol could avoid
the paradox between glycerol dehydratase and aldehyde dehy-
drogenase activities, which generate from the imbalance of vita-
min B12 synthesis and NAD+ regeneration. Under the aerobic
catalysis of 1,3-propanediol oxidoreductase and aldehyde dehy-
drogenase, 3HP was formed via the two-step bio-catalysis
(Fig. 1a)23. This study proposed to use 1,3-propanediol as a
substrate for 3HP production. As 1,3-propanediol can be pro-
duced efﬁciently from glycerol, a biodiesel production byproduct
under an anaerobic bioprocess, it is cost-effective60,61. Under the
1,3-propanediol production conditions, 3HP was outcompeted
with relatively low titer due to the low aldehyde dehydrogenase
enzyme activity under anaerobic conditions6. In this study, 1, 3-
propanediol was converted into 3HP, thus bridging low-cost
glycerol to high-valued 3HP efﬁciently. Also, fewer secondary by-
products were generated in the traditional processes under
aerobic fed-batch condition, especially lactic acid, which is difﬁ-
cult to be separated from 3HP in the culture6.
In this study, glucose was added to support cell growth and
PHB synthesis. The synthesis of 3HP is derived from 1,3-propa-
nediol (Supplementary Fig. 12). Since crude 1,3-propanediol (not
the puriﬁed one for making polymer PTT) produced from the
microbial conversion of crude glycerol (from biodiesel produc-
tion) is sold on Chinese local market with a price of $600/ton,
conversion of 1,3-propanediol to 3HP is almost 100%, the material
cost of 3HP should be around $600/ton excluding other minimal
substrate costs. Since 3HP has not been available in large scale on
the market, its price is offered based on grams. This is not much
value as references for bulk chemicals. However, P3HP3HB with
an improved material property over the existing PHBV sold at a
price of $7000/ton, should have a much high market value even
though 1,3-propanediol is used as a co-substrate.
When PHB production came from consumption of glucose,
3HP yield was increased from 4.2 to 6.4 g L−1, and ~0.21 g L−1
PHB was produced from 5.8 g L −1 glucose (Supplementary
Table 4). Theoretically, the conversion of 1 M glucose to acetyl-
CoA can produce 4 M NADH, and 1 M 3HB-CoA is generated
from 2 M acetyl-CoA, diverting acetyl-CoA away from the TCA
cycle where much of the NADH is generated, reducing the for-
mation of 3 M NADH. Therefore, 0.21 g L−1 PHB (approximately
2.44 mM 3HB-CoA) can reduce 7.32 mM NADH formation. The
3HP yield was improved by the regeneration of NAD + (via
consuming NADH). The excess NADH resulted from 3HP for-
mation via the 1,3-propanediol oxidation feedback inhibits the
glycolysis and 3HP production. On the other hand, PHB pro-
duction from glucose diverts acetyl-CoA away from the TCA
cycle. The decrease in anabolism resulting from a weakened TCA
leads to the accumulation of NADPH. The increased NADPH
inhibits glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity, resulting in
the accumulation of glucose 6-phosphate, thus causing a lower
glucose uptake rate. Therefore, the total amount of glucose used
reduced 3 g L
−1 (16.67 mM) compared with no PHB production
(Supplementary Table 4), further reducing the formation of 66.68
mM NADH. In conclusion, 74 mM (66.68 plus 7.32) NAD+ is
saved for 3HP production. Compared with no PHB production,
the yield of 3HP should be increased by 3.3 g L−1. In fact, 3HP
yield increased by 2.2 g L−1. This may be due to the excess
NADH via the 1,3-propanediol oxidation that also feedback
inhibits the 3HP production.
When PHB production from both glucose and acetic acid, 3HP
yield was increased from 6.4 to 9.3 g L−1, and ~3.2 g L−1 PHB was
produced from 10.5 g L−1 glucose and 4 g L−1 acetic acid (Sup-
plementary Table 4). Theoretically, 1 M NADH is needed to
produce 1 M 3HB-coA from 2 M acetic acid regardless of the ATP
consumption during the conversion of acetate to acetyl-CoA.
Therefore, 4 g L−1 acetic acid (66.67 mM) can consume 33.33
mM NADH and produce 33.33 mM 3HB-CoA (~2.9 g L−1 PHB).
Compared with PHB production from glucose, the yield of 3HP
should be increased by 1.5 g L−1. In fact, 3HP yield increased by
2.9 g L−1. This may be attributed to the utilization of ATP that
can also promote the consumption of NADH by the respiratory
chain. When acetate is added, the consumption of NADH
improves 3HP synthesis and glycolysis by accelerating PHB
synthesis from a bigger acetyl-CoA pool, the true cell mass
increased from 3.5 to 4.8 g L−1. As a result, 3HP be produced at
9.3 g L−1 with the yield of 1.8 mol mol−1 glucose fromﬂask scale
studies (Supplementary Table 4). When the amount of glucose
used was 5 g L−1, 3HP was produced at 18.9 g L−1 with the yield
of 7.6 mol mol−1 glucose onﬂask scales (Supplementary Fig. 14).
Since H. bluephagenesis is able to grow under an unsterilized
conditions with a high tolerance to a high concentration of salt, in
this case, it is salt of 3HP, the chassis is promising for industrial
production of high titer extracellular small molecules including
threonine, succinate, and itaconate
62,63. In contrast, the most
commonly used bacterium,E. coli, demonstrated to have a growth
inhibition at 10 g L−1 3HP in its culture64. H. bluephagenesishas
been used to produce several PHA including PHB, PHBV, and
P3HB4HB. It could be further extended for more PHA synthesis
since many PDORs and ALDHs possess broad substrate speciﬁ-
cities with the potentials for synthesizing other monomers65,66.
Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-5-hydroxyvderate) (P3HB5HV) and
Poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-6-hydroxyhexanoate) (P3HB6HHX)
could also be produced by supplementing corresponding diols to
cultures of H. bluephagenesis based on the polymer biosynthetic
methods mentioned above as some broad speciﬁcity CoA trans-
ferase and PhaC have been reported 67. Moreover, it can be
assumed that pure P3HP can be produced by deleting PHB
synthesis pathway. Since PhaB ofH. bluephagenesisis dependent
on NADH as a cofactor for PHB synthesis, the PHB accumulation
can further consume NADH, thus facilitating further synthesis of
3HP. The 3HP monomer synthesis decreased once the deletion of
PHB synthesis pathway is completed. In order to produce pure
P3HP, the introduction of other metabolic pathways to regenerate
NAD+ can promote 3HP synthesis after the loss of PHB synthesis
pathways. Further investigations could generate more unusual
PHA from this chassis.
In conclusion, this study established an effective 3HP pro-
duction strategy using 1,3-propanediol as a substrate by halo-
philic chassis H. bluephagenesis, demonstrating this strain to be
an excellent chassis. The 3HP has also been found to be able to
become a monomer of the PHA copolymer P3HP3HB.H. blue-
phagenesis, as a platform for the next generation industrial

the China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center (CGMCC) under the
collection number 4353.Escherichia coli S17-1 was used as the host for plasmid
construction and the conjugation donor. The plasmids were constructed using
Gibson Assembly. Plasmid extraction kits were purchased from Tiangen Biotech
Co., Ltd. (Beijing, China). Plasmids for expression were electroporated intoE. coli
S17-1. DNA fragments were ampliﬁed using Q5® High-Fidelity DNA polymerase

Biochemical Co., Ltd. and Abmole (Shanghai, China). Unless indicated otherwise,
1,3-propanediol and all other chemicals were obtained from Shanghai Sangon
Biotech Co., Ltd.
Genome editing using CRISPR/Cas9. Gene insertions and deletions on the
chromosome of H. bluephagenesis were conducted using CRISPR/Cas9 based on
homologous recombination
33,68. After PCR veriﬁcation and DNA sequencing, the
engineered H. bluephagenesis TD with dddA gene deleted was designated as

phagenesis TD27, respectively.
Conjugation. Conjugation was performed as an efﬁcient way to transform plas-
mids intoH. bluephagenesis37. E. coliS17-1, with plasmids electro-transformed in,
were used as donors. The donors andH. bluephagenesis recipient cells were cul-
tured at 37 °C for 4 h till the optical density (OD600) reached 0.3–0.5. After col-
lecting 1 mL of cells ofE. coli S17-1 and H. bluephagenesis by centrifugation
respectively, the pellet cells were washed twice using a 20-LB medium. Then the
cells were re-suspended and mixed at a ratio 1:1, followed by incubation on 20-LB
plates at 37 °C for 12 h. The mixed bacteria were spread on plates containing
corresponding antibiotics and incubated at 37 °C for 24–48 h for single colonies,
which were veriﬁed by PCR for future use.H. bluephagenesis wild-type and
recombinant strains were stored in autoclaved 25% (v/v) glycerol at−80 °C if
needed.
Shake-ﬂask studies. For shake-ﬂask PHA production, a deﬁned minimal medium
containing 6% NaCl, 0.05% urea, 0.02% MgSO
4, 1.0% Na2HPO4·12H2O, 0.15%
KH2PO4, 1.0% trace element solution I, 0.1% trace element solution II and 0.1%
yeast extract, was used. Phosphate buffer was changed to 1.4% K2HPO4·3H2O and
0.52% KH2PO4 in a modiﬁed minimal medium. The pH of the solution was
adjusted to 8.5–9.0 using 5 M NaOH. Trace element solution I comprises 0.5% Fe
(III)-NH4-citrate and 0.2% CaCl2 dissolved in 1 M HCl; Trace element solution II
contains 0.01% ZnSO4·7H2O, 0.003% MnCl2·4H2O, 0.03% H3BO3, 0.02% mg L−1
CoCl2·6H2O, 0.003% NaMoO4·2H2O, 0.002% NiCl2·6H2O, and 0.001%
CuSO4·5H2O dissolved in 1 M HCl. Glucose was added at aﬁnal concentration of
3% at the beginning of the experiment. While 1,3-propanediol (Analytical reagent,
Tianjin Guangfu Chemicals Co., China) was added at 0.5% or other concentrations
as indicated.
For all shake-ﬂask studies, the microbial glycerol stocks were resuscitated by
streaking on fresh 60-LB plates. Single colonies from streaked or newly-conjugated
plates were picked and inoculated in the 60-LB medium for 24 h at 200 rpm to
acquire the ﬁrst seed culture, which was further grown on a fresh 60-LB liquid
medium at a volume ratio of 1%. The second seed culture was inoculated for 10 h at
200 rpm until its OD600 reached 1.0. Afterward, it was inoculated into 500-mL
conical ﬂasks containing 50 mL of the deﬁned minimal medium at a volume ratio
of 5% and cultivated for 48 h at 200 rpm. Antibiotics were added if needed. The
temperature for all cultivations was 37 °C. All data were analyzed and graphed by
GraphPad Prism 8.
RNA sequencing and quantitative RT-PCR. The bacteria were sampled from
shake-ﬂask experiments after 12 h cultivation. Then, the samples were centrifuged
at 4000 ×g and 4 °C for 10 min followed by quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen. For
RNA sequencing and analysis, they were transported immediately to the testing
company in dry ice (solid carbon dioxide). RNA extraction, sequencing, and
analysis were performed by Hangzhou Lianchuan Bio Technologies Co. Ltd.
Brieﬂy, RNA was extracted by TRIzol® Reagent (Invitrogen, U.S.A). The RNA
library was constructed using Illumina Truseq
TM RNA sample prep Kit (Illumina,
U.S.A). Sequencing was performed using the Illumina Hiseq platform after the
processing of libraries via Truseq SBS Kit v3-HS (Illumina, U.S.A). The expression
differences were analyzed using edgeR.
For quantitative RT-PCR, total RNA was isolated from bacterial culture using
TRIzol® Reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration
was determined via spectrophotometry at 260 nm. Removal of genomic DNA and
synthesis of cDNA were carried out using PrimeScript RT reagent Kit with gDNA
Eraser (Takara). qRT-PCR was conducted using 2× RealStar Green Power Mixture
with ROX II (Genstar, China) with the 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems). Constitutively transcribed 16s rRNA was used as a reference control
to normalize the total RNA quantity of different samples. The relative difference of
mRNA level was calculated using theΔΔCt method
69. Two independent biological
samples with three technical repeats for each sample were performed for each qRT-
PCR analysis.
Protein expression and enzyme activities. Plasmids p90, p91, p92, and p98 were
constructed encoding genesadhP, aldD
Hb, dhaTPp with a His-tag on C-terminal
and aldDPp with a His-tag on N-terminal, respectively. ThealdH gene, with a His-
tag on N-terminal, was ampliﬁed by PCR usingE. coliMG1655 genomic DNA as a
template and cloned into the p59 plasmid by replacing thealdDHb gene. This
plasmid was labeled as p99. ThedhaTKp gene with a His-tag on C-terminal orpuuC
gene with a His-tag on N-terminal was ampliﬁed by PCR usingK. pneumoniae
DSMZ 2026 genomic DNA as a template and cloned into the p59 plasmid by
replacing theadhP or aldDHb gene. These plasmids were labeled as p95 and p100.
All the recombinant plasmids were conjugated intoH. bluephagenesis TDΔdddA
and cultivated in a deﬁned minimal medium containing 20 g L−1 glucose, 20 g L−1
1,3-propanediol, and 3 g L−1 acetic acid. The recombinant strains were cultured in
conical ﬂasks and grown for 24 h. Subsequently, they were harvested by cen-
trifugation under 4000 ×g and 4 °C for 20 min. Proteins were puriﬁed by a His-tag
Protein Puriﬁcation Kit (Beyotime, China) and stored at−80 °C for further usage.
The enzyme activity was assayed by a VarioskanFlash plate reader (Version 4.00.53,
Thermo Scientiﬁc, USA).
The reductive activity (forward reaction) of AdhP, DhaTPp, and DhaTKp were
assayed as follows, respectively: First, the reaction mixture containing 50 mM Tris-
HCl buffer (pH 7.0) and 10 nM enzyme was incubated for 2 min at 37 °C. The
reaction was initiated by the addition of 0.1 mM of NADH and 5 mM 3HPA. The
enzyme activity was determined by measuring the NADH oxidation using the
molar extinction coefﬁcient (Δε
340) of 6.22 × 103 M−1 cm−1. The oxidative activity
(reverse reaction) of AdhP, DhaTPp, and DhaTKp were measured as follows: The
reaction mixture containing 100 mM potassium carbonate buffer (pH 9.0), 30 mM
ammonium sulfate, and 100 nM enzyme was incubated for 2 min at 37 °C. The
reaction was initiated by the addition of 2 mM of NAD+ and 150 mM 1,3-
propanediol51. The activity of the aldehyde dehydrogenase was determined by
measuring the level of NAD+ reduction to NADH at 340 nm. The reaction mixture
containing 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), 1 mM DTT, and 100 nM
enzyme was incubated at 37 °C for 5 min. The reaction was initiated by adding
2.0 mM 3HPA and 2.0 mM NAD
+. The amount of NADH formed was studied
using a molar extinction coefﬁcient (Δε340) of 6.22 × 103 M−1 cm−1. One unit of
aldehyde dehydrogenase activity was deﬁned as the amount of enzyme needed to
reduce 1 μmol of NAD+ to NADH in 1 min49.
NADH assays. All cells were harvested after fermentation via centrifugation under
2500 ×g at 4 °C for 10 min. 200μL cells were collected from each sample, followed
by washing using ice-cold PBS at pH 7.4. The obtained pellet was disrupted by a
chemical lysis method using 400μL BugBuster® Master Mix (ThermoFisher Sci-
entiﬁc Inc., USA). All operations were strictly conducted based on instructions of
NAD/NADH Assay Kit S0175 (Beyotime, China).
3HP and PHB production in a 7 L fermenter. Fed-batch studies were performed
in a 7 LBioFlo fermenter (New Brunswick Scientiﬁc, U.S.A) with a 3 L working
volume without sterilization. The growth temperature was 37 °C, maintained via a
cooling circulation pump (Henan Jinghua Instrument, China). The pH was
maintained at 8.5 using an automatic pump added 5 M NaOH into the culture
system when needed. The fermentation agitation speed was set at 200 rpm at the

beginning, coupled with dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration, and gradually
increased to 800 rpm to maintain the DO level above 30% compared with the one
in a cell-free fermenter (set as 100%). The agitation speed was maintained at 800
rpm to the end of fermentation. The inlet airﬂow rate was maintained at 3 L min−1
during the entire fermentation process.
The seed culture has the same medium as that in shakeﬂasks. A 300 mL seed
culture (10% of the total volume) was prepared for inoculation into the fermenter.
The OD600 of the seeds was adjusted to 3. For fermentor studies, low-cost substrates
were used and the deﬁned minimal medium was modiﬁed by utilizing 16 g L−1 corn
steep (Baisheng, Shandong Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China) instead of the expensive
yeast extract, the NaCl concentration was reduced to 40 from 60 g L−1.
For 3HP production, a two-stage and intermittent feeding strategy were
adopted using different feeding solutions. 400 mL feeding solution I containing
800 g L
−1 glucose and 30 g L−1 urea was used to increase cell mass accumulation
and PHB formation during theﬁrst 16 h. 200 mL feeding Solution II containing
800 g L−1 glucose and 15 g L−1 urea was added after feeding Solution I exhausted.
The ﬂow rates of the feeding solutions depended on the residual glucose
concentrations that should be controlled between 5 and 10 g L−1 measured using
the GA-3 blood glucose meter and GA-3 blood glucose test strip (Sinocare, China).
60 g L
−1 1,3-propanediol and 6 g L−1 acetic acid were added three times separately
at 24, 32, and 38 h after the beginning of the fermentations. OD600 of the cultured
bacteria was measured by a V-5600 visible light spectrophotometer (Shanghai
Yuanxi Instrument, China).
For P3HB3HP production, a two-stage feeding strategy was used with different
feeding solutions. 400 mL feeding solution I containing 800 g L−1 glucose, 30 g L−1
urea, and 75 g L−1 1,3-propanediol was used to increase cell mass and P3HB3HP
formation during theﬁrst 20 h. 200 mL feeding solution II containing 800 g L−1
glucose, 15 g L−1 urea, and 75 g L−1 1,3-propanediol was added after feeding
solution I exhausted.
PHA puriﬁcation and analysis. After shake-ﬂask growth, cells were harvested by
centrifugation (CR21 GIII, Hitachi, Japan) at 8000 ×g for 10 min, washed twice
with distilled water, and placed in−80 °C for 4 h. After cells lyophilizing for 12 h,
their intracellular PHA was extracted using a Soxtec 2050 Soxhlet extractor (Foss,
Denmark). PHA polymers were puriﬁed by re-dissolving the extracted materials in
chloroform, then precipitated using absolute ethanol, centrifuged at 12,000 ×g for
10 min to harvest the puriﬁed PHA materials, followed by lyophilization again to
remove residual ethanol.
The dry cell mass was determined by weighing 30 mL lyophilized centrifuged
bacterial cells. For the esteriﬁcation reaction, 40–60 mg lyophilized cells were
placed into a 2 mL esteriﬁcation reagent containing 3% sulfuric acid and 0.1%
benzoic acid, both dissolved in absolute methanol. After adding 2 mL chloroform,
the whole reaction was performed at 100 °C for 4 h. PHA contents were determined
by GC-2014 gas chromatography (Shimadzu, Japan). P3HB (99.9%, Sigma-Aldrich,
Germany) was used as standards, respectively. The peak of benzoic acid was
regarded as the internal standard.
Chemical quantiﬁcation using high-performance liquid chromatography.
Concentrations of 3HP, glucose, acetic acid, and 1,3-propanediol were determined
via high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). An LC-20 instrument
(Shimadzu, Japan) with an Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad, U.S.A) and a
RID-10A refractive index detector (Shimadzu) was employed. The mobile phase
was a 5 mM degassed H
2SO4 with a ﬂow rate of 0.5 mL min−1. The column
temperature was maintained at 55 °C70. The culture media were centrifuged at
12,000 × g and 4 °C for 2 min to obtain the supernatant, which was thenﬁltered
through a 0.22μm polyethersulfone membrane syringeﬁlter (Jinglong, China) and
used as the samples with a loading volume of 30μL. Standards of the above
chemicals were prepared byﬁve different concentrations to draw the standard
curves, from which the concentrations of the sample were calculated.
Nuclear magnetic resonance. PHA samples (2–5 mg) were dissolved in deuter-
ated chloroform for1H NMR with a JNM-ECA600 nuclear magnetic resonance
instrument (JEOL, Japan). Chemical shifts were given in ppm while 0.03% v/v
tetramethylsilane (TMS) served as an internal standard to calibrate against the
signal of samples.
