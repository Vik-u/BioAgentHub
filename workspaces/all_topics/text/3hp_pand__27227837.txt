Abstract
Our study aimed to produce the commercially promising platform chemical 3-hydroxypro-
pionic acid (3-HP) via the propionyl-CoA pathway in genetically engineeredEscherichia
coli. RecombinantE. coli Ec-P overexpressing propionyl-CoA dehydrogenase (PACD,
encoded by thepacd gene fromCandida rugosa) under the T7 promoter produced 1.33 mM
of 3-HP in a shake flask culture supplemented with 0.5% propionate. When propionate
CoA-transferase (PCT, encoded by thepct gene fromMegasphaera elsdenii) and 3-hydro-
xypropionyl-CoA dehydratase (HPCD, encoded by thehpcd gene fromChloroflexus auran-
tiacus) were expressed along with PACD, the 3-HP titer of the resultingE. coli Ec-PPH
strain was improved by 6-fold. The effect of the cultivation conditions on the 3-HP yield from
propionate in theEc-PPH strain was also investigated. When cultured at 30°C with 1% glu-
cose in addition to propionate, 3-HP production byEc-PPH increased 2-fold and 12-fold
compared to the cultivation at 37°C (4.23 mM) or without glucose (0.68 mM). Deletion of the
ygfH gene encoding propionyl-CoA: succinate CoA-transferase fromEc-PPH (resulting in
the strainEc-ΔY-PPH) led to increase of 3-HP production in shake flask experiments (15.04
mM), whereas the strainEc-ΔY-PPH with deletion of theprpC gene (encoding methylcitrate
synthase in the methylcitrate cycle) produced 17.76 mM of 3-HP. The strainEc-ΔY-ΔP-PPH
with bothygfH and prpC genes deleted produced 24.14 mM of 3-HP, thus showing an 18-
fold increase in the 3-HP titer in compare to the strainEc-P.
Introduction
3-Hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP; C3H6O3; MW 90.08) is one of the most valuable platform
chemicals due to its great potential in the synthesis of novel polymer materials and other deriv-
atives, such as 1,3-propanediol, malonic acid, acrylonitrile, and acrylamide, all of which are
used in large quantities in industry [1– 3]. Compared to the present costly multi-step chemical

processes, the biosynthesis of 3-HP by microorganisms is considerded to be an effective alter-
native for its mild operation conditions and reduced environmental loads [4, 5].
It was reported that 3-HP could be accumulated as an end product from glycerol, glucose or
acrylic acid in a variety of microorganisms [6– 8]. Several distinct enzymatic routes have been
proposed for microbial 3-HP production [9– 14], among them, the modifiedβ-oxidation path-
way (also known as the propionyl-CoA pathway: propionic acid! propionyl-CoA ! acry-
loyl-CoA ! 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA ! 3-HP) that likely exists in some microorganisms
that naturally produce 3-HP [15]. InE. coli grown on glucose propionyl-CoA can be derived
from succinyl-CoA [16], and aCandida rugosamutant is able to produce 40.2 g/l of 3-HP, pre-
sumably via the propionyl-CoA pathway. This is the highest titer obtained from non-engi-
neered microorganisms in the literature. This route is therefore proposed to have great
potential for the bioengineering ofE. coli to produce 3-HP from propionyl-CoA pathway [15].
However, the biological production of 3-HP via the propionyl-CoA pathway inE. coli has not
been studied.
Only a few key enzymes need to be introduced to establish 3-HP production via the propio-
nyl-CoA pathway inE. coli (Fig 1). These enzymes are propionate CoA-transferase (PCT,
EC:2.8.3.1) [17– 19], catalyzing the CoA transfer from acetyl-CoA to propionate, propionyl-
CoA dehydrogenase (PACD, EC:1.3.8.7) [15, 20, 21], which subsequently converts propionyl-
CoA to acryloyl-CoA, and 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase (HPCD, EC:4.2.1.17) [22,
23], converting acryloyl-CoA to 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA. Finally, 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA
(3-HP-CoA) can be converted to 3-HP by the action of either PCT or 3-hydroxypropionyl-
CoA hydrolase [17, 18]. In this schematic biosynthesis of 3-HP, competitive pathways such as
the methylcitrate cycle (MC cycle) and tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA cycle) are also indicated
(Fig 1).
Propionate and its derivative propionyl-CoA can be metabolized byE. coli (propionyl-CoA
metabolism pathway in KEGG Database: pathway ID ko00640) [24]. To increase the yield of

3-HP on propionate, these competing propionate metabolic pathways should be down-regu-
lated or even disrupted. Enzymes such as propionyl-CoA: succinate CoA-transferase (YgfH)
[25, 26] and methylcitrate synthase (PrpC) [24, 27, 28] are responsible for the propionate
metabolism inE. coli, and deleting them could result in an increased yield of 3-HP [26, 28, 29].
In this work, the genes of PCT, HPCD and PACD were obtained from different bacterial
species, and a recombinantE. coli containing the propionyl-CoA pathway for 3-HP production
was constructed. The effects of the culture conditions (e.g., temperature and carbon source) on
3-HP accumulation were also tested. To improve the 3-HP yield on propionate by preventing
the degradation of propionyl-CoA in the cells, theygfH and prpC genes in the host strain were
deleted, and the 3-HP productivity of the engineered strains was evaluated.

Cloning ofpct, pacd and hpcd genes
The bacterial strains and the plasmids used in this study are summarized inTable 1. Lysogeny
broth (LB) medium was used for the routine genetic engineering, protein expression and cul-
ture maintenance. A final concentration of 50 mg/l kanamycin and 25 mg/l chloramphenicol
were added to the medium before inoculation. Gene manipulations were carried out using
standard methods [30].To expresspacd, the pACYCDuet-1 vector with the T7 promoter was
adopted. Thepct and hpcd genes were cloned into the pET-28a vector. Details on the construc-
tion of the plasmids are shown inFig 2.
To construct a recombinant expression vector pACYCDuet-PACD, the full-length cDNA
encoding the PACD ofCandida rugosawas cloned by RT-PCR using the Aidlab Biotechnologies
kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and the coding region of PACD (GenBank
number GU338397) was amplified by PCR with the primers listed inS1 Table.T h eNde I, Xho I-
digested PCR product was finally incorporated into the MCS-II of the pACYCDuet-1 vector.
The pct gene (GenBank: HE576794.1) was obtained from the isolated genomic DNA of
Megasphaera elsdeniiby PCR. The 1554 bp PCR fragment was first ligated in the pBS-T vector
by means of TA cloning, and its sequence was confirmed by Sunbiotech Co., Ltd (Beijing). The
pct gene was then released by the flankingNdeI andBamHI sites and sub-cloned into the pET-
28a vector to generate pET-PCT.
To obtain the HPCD-overexpressing plasmid pET-HPCD, thehpcd gene (encoding HPCD)
was amplified from the genomic DNA ofChloroflexus aurantiacusand successively con-
structed in the pBS-T and pET-28a vectors using the same method as forpct. The T7-HPCD
fragment was then digested viaBglII andEcoRI sites from pET-HPCD, and the pET-PCT frag-
ment missing the sequence between theBamHI (the isocaudomer ofBglII) andEcoRI sites was
incorporated with it, thereby obtaining pET-PH.
The plasmid pACYCDuet-PACD was transformed intoE. coli BL21(DE3) individually and
combined with pET-PH, and the recombinant strainsEc-P andEc-PPH were obtained for pro-
tein expression and 3-HP production, respectively.

Gene deletion of YgfH and PrpC
The ygfH and prpC gene deletions ofEc-PPH were performed by directly disrupting the target
gene via kanamycin marker insertion using Red recombination, followed by the kanamycin
resistance cassette excision mediated through the flippase recombination enzyme harbored by
pCP20 [31]. The primers used for inserting the kanamycin cassette into theygfH and prpC
genes are listed inS1 Table. TheygfH, prpC, and bothygfH and prpC gene deletion mutants are
referred to asEc-ΔY-PPH, Ec-ΔP-PPH, andEc-ΔY-ΔP -PPH, respectively.
Protein expression and gel electrophoresis
To verify that the recombinant strains had been properly constructed, the parent strainE. coli
BL21(DE3) and two recombinant strains (Ec-P andEc-PPH) were cultured in LB medium and
induced at 25°C with 50μM IPTG at OD600 of 0.8. The cells were harvested after 6 h induction
and centrifuged at 10,000 g at 4°C for 15 min. The cell pellets were washed twice and then

resuspended in 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0). The cells were lysed by sonica-
tion and then centrifuged at 10,000 g for 20 min. The supernatants were subjected to
SDS-PAGE to examine protein expression [30]. Coomassie Brilliant Blue R250 was used for
protein staining.
Cultivation of recombinantE. coli strains
Unless indicated otherwise, shake flask cultivation was carried out with a 20 mL working vol-
ume in 100-ml Erlenmeyer flasks at 30°C in an incubator shaker at 200 rpm. The media used
in this study were MI medium, containing glucose 1%, peptone 1%, yeast extract 0.5%, NaCl
1% and MgSO
4/C17H2O 0.025%, pH 7.0, and MII medium, which is MI medium without the glu-
cose. Kanamycin (Kan) at 50 mg/l was added to the strainEc-P. ForEc-PPH, kanamycin and
chloramphenicol (Cm) were added at 50 mg/l and 25 mg/l, respectively. The recombinant
strains were cultured in the above mediums and induced at OD600 of 0.8 with 50μM IPTG.
After 6 h induction, 0.5% propionate was added. Samples were withdrawn periodically to
determine the concentrations of 3-HP and residual propionate.
Analytical methods
The propionate and 3-HP concentrations were assayed by high performance liquid chromatog-
raphy (HPLC). The supernatants obtained by the centrifugation of the culture samples at
10,000 g for 10 min were filtered through a 0.22μm filter and isocratically eluted through a
Venusil MP C18 column (4.6 mm×250 mm, 5μm particle size, Agela Technologies, Inc.) with
methanol-10 mM H3PO4 (5:95, v/v) as the mobile phase. The flow rate and the detection wave-
length were set to 0.8 ml/min and UV 208 nm, respectively. Pure 3-HP and propionate were
assayed by HPLC independently to determine their retention time to be able to identify them
later in the chromatogram of each sample. The samples of three independent cultures were
assayed, and the standard deviation of the measurements was less than 5% for propionate and
3-HP.

Results
Expression of PCT, HPCD and PACD in recombinantE. coli
To construct a pathway as shown inFig 1, three enzymes corresponding to the formation of
the intermediates propionyl-CoA, acryloyl-CoA and 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA are required.
E. coli possesses genes encoding PrpE (propionyl-CoA synthetase) [32, 33] and enoyl-CoA
hydratase [34, 35], which are functionally similar to PCT and HPCD, respectively. It does,
however, lack a gene encoding PACD. Therefore, introducing PACD alone may already be
enough to establish the pathway inE. coli.
It was reported that the overexpression of propionyl-CoA synthetase (PrpE) inE. coli could
increase the formation of propionyl-CoA [28]. However, the activation of propionate to its
CoA ester by PrpE requires two ATPs [35]. Thus, employing a CoA transferase could be prefer-
able for the production of propionyl-CoA, as no additional ATP would be required (Fig 1).
Enoyl-CoA hydratase catalyzes the hydration ofα,β-unsaturated CoA thioesters during ß-
oxidation of fatty acids [36]. There might be low substrate specificity for the enoyl-CoA hydra-
tase ofE. coli for acryloyl-CoA, which is not a native metabolite in the host cell. Hence, the
gene hpcd from Chloroflexus aurantiacus[22], encoding an enoyl-CoA hydratase specific for
acryloyl-CoA, was cloned and expressed in the recombinantE. coli.
Therefore, to produce 3-HP via the propionyl-CoA pathway, the recombinantE. coli strains
Ec-PPH (expressing PACD, PCT and HPCD) andEc-P (expressing PACD alone) were con-
structed, and the protein expressions of these strains were assayed.Fig 3shows the expression
profile of the desired recombinant proteins. The heterologous genes of PCT, PACD and HPCD
could be expressed in a soluble form in the recombinantE. coli. PACD (with a molecular
weight of 49 kDa) was found to be the most abundant protein in the cell lysate ofEc-P. When

PACD was co-expressed with PCT and HPCD inEc-PPH, its expression level decreased to
some extent (Fig 3).
Cultivation of the recombinantE. coli strains for 3-HP production
To evaluate the potential of the recombinant strains for the production of 3-HP through the
propionyl-CoA pathway, the cultivation ofEC-P andEc-PPH was conducted in MI medium
with 0.5% propionic acid at 30°C (Fig 4A). When PACD is expressed alone (Ec-P), the final
3-HP titer at 25 h was 1.33 mM. In comparison, when heterologous PCT and HPCD were co-
expressed with PACD (Ec-PPH), the yield of 3-HP was increased 6-fold to 8.11 mM.
As mentioned, propionyl-CoA utilizing metabolic pathways exist inE. coli [24, 26, 37],
which lead to a reduced amount of propionyl-CoA being converted to acryloyl-CoA. Further-
more, in contrast to the lowKm value of someE.coli enzymes to propionyl-CoA (for example,
the Km value of PrpC to propionyl-CoA is 17μM) [24], theKm value of PACD to propionyl-

CoA was reported to be as high as 40.86μM[ 21]. Therefore, improvement of the PACD activ-
ity is necessary for efficient functioning of the modifiedβ-oxidation pathway. On the other
hand, inactivation of theprpC gene of the host should be helpful to increase the pool of intra-
cellular propionyl-CoA, and the result of this experiment will be stated later in this work.
The production of 3-HP byEC-P overexpressing PACD alone indicates the presence of the
propionyl-CoA synthetase and 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase activities. In the past
decades, distinctive types of CoA transferase have been reported in many bacterial strains. Some
of these enzymes have been purified fromEscherichia coli[38], Peptostreptococcus elsdenii[18],
Ralstonia eutropha[39], Clostridium propionicum[40]a n dClostridium sp. strain SB4 [41]a n d
some of them show catalytic activity for the conversion of propionate to propionyl-CoA. In addi-
tion, the 3-hydroxypropionyl-CoA dehydratase activities of various hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydra-
tases have been demonstrated to be present inEscherichia coli[42] and several other species such
as Metallosphaera sedula[43] Sulfolobus tokodaii[44]a n dNitrosopumilus maritimus[45].
Compared toEc-P, Ec-PPH showed a much higher 3-HP yield, which might be due to the
high catalytic efficiencies of the co-expressed enzymes, PCT and HPCD. The overexpression of
PCT inEc-PPH was expected to increase the intracellular level of propionyl-CoA, which is an
immediate substrate for PACD. The synthesis of propionyl-CoA by PCT does not need ATP,
while the production of propionyl-CoA from propionate inEc-P requires the function of its
endogenous PrpE, which requires additional ATP [35]. The overexpression of HPCD inEc-
PPH could accelerate the consumption of the PACD product, namely acryloyl-CoA, leading to
the increasd 3-HP yield.
The co-expression of heterologous PCT and HPCD helps to strengthen the desired pathway
and reduce the generation of by-products. The results inFig 4Asuggest that to promote 3-HP
production via the propionyl-CoA pathway, the PACD activity as well as the propionyl-CoA
concentration and acryloyl-CoA conversion in the recombinant cells should be increased.
Glucose, a low-cost and highly efficient substrate, was considered in this work as an addi-
tional carbon source that may accelerate the 3-HP synthesis byEc-PPH (Fig 4B).
In the absence of glucose, the production of 3-HP was only 0.67 mM, which is presumably
owing to the insufficient ATP supply. As reported in Ref. 46, the synthesis of plasmid-encoded
proteins is energetically demanding and leads to a redirection of metabolic fluxes in the cell,
e.g. to an increased flow through the TCA cycle [46]. Without the glucose supplementation,
propionic acid tends to be used for energy production, thus decreasing the flow through the
propionyl-CoA pathway. However, propionic acid is not a preferable energy source as glucose
is forE. coli, and ATP generated from propionate is far from being enough for the synthesis of
growth-related and heterologous proteins, further weakening the 3-HP production.
The addition of glucose fulfilled the rising energy demands and resulted in a 12-fold
increase in the 3-HP yield. As demonstrated here, the presence of glucose or another carbon
source is required for the highly efficient production of 3-HP.
Ap r e v i o u ss t u d y[21] reported that the PACD activity was the highest at 30°C. Nevertheless, it
decreased to 30% of its original activity when incubated for 2 h at 37°C. At contrast, two other
enzymes of the pathway (PCT, HPCD) had higheractivity at 37°C, and this temperature is also
optimal forE. coli [18]. Therefore, We compared the 3-HP production byEc-PPH at 30 and 37°C.
As shown inFig 4C, Ec-PPH produced only 4.23 mM 3-HP at 37°C (with the 3-HP yield
from propionate of 8.2%), whereas 8.11mM 3-HP synthesized at 30°C (with the 14.5% yield).
It suggests a crucial role of heterologous PACD in the process, thus revealing propionyl-CoA
conversion to acryloyl-CoA as a rate-limiting step of the constructed pathway. In contrast, an
increase of the temperature to 37°C (which is optimal forE. coli metabolism) results in
increased by-products formation, weakening desirable 3-HP accumulation.

Effect ofygfH and prpC deletion on 3-HP production
E. coli is known to be capable to metabolize propionyl-CoA [24, 26, 37]. For example, in the
presence of succinate, propionyl-CoA can be converted by CoA-transferase into propionate
and succinyl-CoA, and the succinyl-CoA is then utilized in the TCA cycle [26]. Propionyl-CoA
could also be converted via the MC cycle to pyruvate, a key intermediate in cellular metabolism
[24]. Thus, nativeE. coli metabolism of propionyl-CoA would result in a reduced amount of
propionyl-CoA being converted to acryloyl-CoA.
As propionyl-CoA is a key precursor for 3-HP formation, theE. coli strain was further
engineered to supply more propionyl-CoA into the 3-HP biosynthesis pathway by disrupting
the competing metabolic pathways. 3-HP production from propionic acid was examined on a
flask scale using four engineeredE. coli host strains (wild typeE. coli, Ec-ΔygfH, Ec-ΔprpC,
and Ec-ΔygfH ΔprpC) containingpacd, pct and hpcd (Fig 5); they were tested three times
independently.

As shown inFig 5, the growth of all these strains was very similar, whereas the deletion of
the ygfH and/or prpC genes significantly increased the 3-HP accumulation in the engineered
strains (Ec-ΔY-PPH, Ec-ΔP-PPH andEc-ΔY-ΔP-PPH). Indeed,Ec-ΔY-PPH andEc-ΔP-PPH
strains produced 15.04 and 17.76 mM of 3-HP, respectively, whereas deletion of bothygfH and
prpC genes in theEc-ΔY-ΔP-PPH strain increased the 3-HP production from 9.23 to 24.14
mM, i.e. 2.6-fold. This underscores the importance of redirecting the metabolic fluxes through
the designed pathway by disrupting processes that compete for propionyl-CoA.
Discussion
In this work, recombinantE. coli strains were engineered to express the key enzymes (PACD,
PCT and HPCD) of the propionyl-CoA pathway for 3-HP production. RecombinantE. coli
could produce 3-HP when cultured in a propionate-containing medium. Considering that pro-
pionyl-CoA is the key intermediate in this pathway and that propionate could be produced by
some types of microorganisms [47], including the popular engineering hostE. coli [16], to pro-
duce 3-HP, the propionyl-CoA pathway is a promising alternative route to the commonly
reported pathways that use glucose or glycerol as the carbon source [6, 12].
If no propionate was fed in the medium, 3-HP could not be detected in the broth of the
recombinant strains during the whole period of cultivation (0– 25 h). This result suggests that
the propionyl-CoA pool of the host strain was not sufficient to produce a detectable amount of
3-HP. In contrast to glucose or glycerol, propionate is not a usual and economical carbon
source for bio-based product synthesis. As propionate itself is a biological product and its bio-
synthesis pathways inPropionibacterium [47] andE. coli [16] have been well established, fur-
ther efforts are required to improve the intracellular propionyl-CoA pool by introducing a
propionate/propionyl-CoA synthesis pathway into the recombinant strains mentioned above.
The intracellular propionyl-CoA pool might also be enhanced by inhibiting the endogenous
propionyl-CoA catabolism, so we disrupted the metabolic pathways diverted to the MC cycle
and/or the TCA cycle (Fig 1). Based on previous reports that the conversion of propionyl-CoA
to target products could be improved by the deletion of theygfH gene encoding propionyl-
CoA:succinate CoA-transferase [26, 48]o ro ft h eprpC gene encoding 2-methylcitrate synthase
[29, 48], the effect of deleting these genes on the 3-HP production was examined (Fig 5).
The results indicate that the effect ofygfH gene deletion on the 3-HP titer was similar to
that ofprpC gene deletion, and the combination of theygfH and prpC gene deletions increased
the 3-HP titer, exhibiting an efficiency higher than that of either single gene deletion. However,
in a previously reported work on the accumulation of a propionyl-CoA derived product, poly
(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate), inE. coli [48], deletion of theprpC gene did not
significantly increase the 3-HV (3-hydroxyvalerate) fraction, while deletion of theygfH gene
significantly increased the 3-HV fraction in the copolymer. By comparing our work to that of
Chen et al [48], there were differences in the effects ofygfH and prpC gene deletion on the
product accumulations, suggesting that the metabolic flux from propionyl-CoA to the MC or
TCA cycle inE.
coli was product-dependent.
By culturing these recombinant strains in propionate-containing medium, the conversion
yields of propionate to 3-HP were typically in the range of 3% to 15%, implying that the native
metabolism of propionate detracts propionyl-CoA from the desired 3-HP biosynthesis. By dis-
rupting the genes for key enzymes of the competing metabolic pathways,ygfH and prpC, the
3-HP yield on propionate forEc-ΔY-ΔP-PPH increased to 35.4%, not a very high value yet,
suggesting that there are other unidentified propionyl-CoA metabolic pathway(s) in theE. coli
host. Propionyl-CoA carboxylase (PCC), an enzyme that can effectively convert propionyl-
CoA to (2S)-methylmalonyl-CoA, has been reported in many species [43, 49], although not in

E. coli. Considering that the carboxylations of acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA are often shown
to be catalyzed by a single ATP-dependent enzyme [43, 50], the function of propionyl-CoA
carboxylation inE. coli might be applied by acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC). However, ACC is
essential for the central metabolism of the host cell and can not be deleted. In addition, the ace-
tyl-CoA:short-chain fatty acid CoA-transferase inE. coli might act as the isoenzyme of YgfH
because of the broad substrate specificity of bacterial CoA transferases for short-chain acyl-
CoA thioesters [18, 38], and the intracellular propionyl-CoA concentration would be reduced
by the reaction of CoA transferase even in theΔygfH strain. Thus, further down-regulating the
propionyl-CoA catabolic flux and increasing the intracellular propionyl-CoA pool by, e.g.,
introducing genes for the synthesis of propionyl-CoA in the host might contribute to the future
improvement of the 3-HP yield.
In conclusion, a PACD gene fromCandida rugosawas heterologously expressed inE. coli
and its effect on 3-HP production was demonstrated. By overexpressing PCT and HPCD along
with PACD, 3-HP production improved six-fold due to the strengthened metabolic flux to
3-HP. The presence of glucose in the medium and the use of an appropriate temperature
ensured that there was a sufficient energy source and optimal enzyme thermostability, which
contributed to higher 3-HP titers. Furthermore, disruption of the competing propionyl-CoA
metabolic pathways by deleting theygfH and prpC genes resulted in a 2.6-fold improvement in
the 3-HP titer. It is expected that the 3-HP yield of the recombinant strains could be increased
by further minimizing the carbon flux to the other metabolites and balancing the activities
among the targeted enzymes. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the bio-
synthesis of 3-HP in a recombinant strain via the propionyl-CoA pathway.
