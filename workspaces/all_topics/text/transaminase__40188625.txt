ABSTRACT
This experiment examined the potential of olive leaf powder (OLP) as a natural growth enhancer in broiler feed 
and its influences on growth performance, carcass characteristics, blood parameters, and intestinal bacterial 
count. A total of 210 one-day-old Arbor Acres chicks were randomly allocated into three groups. The control 
group was given a basal diet only, the 2
nd 
and 3
rd 
groups were given basal diet supplemented with 1 g OLP and 2 
g OLP/kg diet, respectively. Each group consisted of seven replicates with 10 unsexed chicks each. The exper -
imental trial lasted for thirty-one days. Results showed that, the OLP2 group exhibited a significant increase in 
live body weight (LBW) at days 14 and 21 of age, whereas the OLP1 group experienced a considerable rise in 
body weight gain (BWG) between days 29 and 31 of age. Average daily feed intake (ADFI) considerably 
decreased during the first 8 – 14 days of the trial, but increased during the next 29 – 31 days throughout the entire 
duration (1 – 31 days). While, Feed conversion ratio (FCR) was improved in OLP groups during the 15-31 days of 
trial. Carcass and breast yields improved significantly with OLP supplementation, while abdominal fat content 
was reduced. Blood analysis revealed considerable enhances in total protein, albumin, and globulin levels in both 
OLP groups, while alanine transaminase (ALT) , creatinine, total cholesterol (TC) , triglycerides (TG) , and very 
low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) levels were considerably reduced. Notably, immunity and antioxidant markers 
showed significant improvement with 2 g OLP supplementation. Due to OLP supplementation, the number of 
beneficial bacteria such as Lactobacillus rose while the number of all harmful bacteria ( E. coli and Clostridium ) in 
caecal samples declined. In conclusion, OLP supplementation at 1 g and 2 g per kg of feed demonstrated a 
significant positive impact on broiler growth performance, carcass quality, lipid profile, immunity, antioxidant 
status, and raised the number of beneficial bacteria in the caecal contents of the broiler chickens, making it a 
promising natural growth promoter in poultry production.

Introduction
Recently, it has become illegal worldwide to utilize antibiotics as 
feed additives in the production of chickens ( Youssef et al., 2024a ; Abd 
El-Hack et al., 2024 ). Consequently, scientists have been searching far 
and wide for substitutes that exhibit comparable mechanisms of action 
to antibiotic growth promoters (AGP) in an effort to enhance chicken 
health, poultry product safety, and production competence. Artificial 
growth stimulants and antibiotics have recently been replaced with 
organic feed and supplements including medicinal plants ( El-Abasy 
et al., 2025 ; Deeb et al., 2024 ). Youssef et al. (2024b) and Dosoky et al. 
(2024) assert that these supplements enhance immunity and boost 
productivity. In order to prevent and treat infections from viruses, 
bacteria, parasites, and immunopotentiators, a great deal of research has 
been done on alternatives to antibiotic supplements for chicken pro -
duction ( Youssef et al., 2023a , b , c ; D ’ Alessandro et al., 2024 ).
According to Sola-ojo et al. (2019) , antioxidants play a critical role in 
mitigating these harmful effects. While artificial antioxidants such as 
propyl gallate, butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) , and butylated 
hydroxyanisole (BHA) used in animal breeding may be effective, their 
safety for both humans and animals is questionable given the higher 
incidence of malignant tumors in animals. Conversely, natural antioxi -
dants that employed in birds are secure, beneficial, trustworthy and 
known to be wide-sourced. In order to lessen oxidative stress and 
enhance the quality of meat and chicken, look for naturally occurring, 
safe antioxidants from agriculture residues ( Felter et al., 2021 ).
Olive leaves (OL) ( Olea Europea L.) are obtained by beating the olive 
trees (agricultural leftovers) for fruit harvest. Oleuropein, tyrosol, and 
hydroxytyrosol are among the many useful compounds located in OL 
( Silva et al., 2006 ; Batçıo ˘glu et al., 2023 ). Between 8 % and 14 % of the 
olive leaf was made up of oleeuropein ( Erragued et al., 2024 ). Olive 
leaves also include particular phenols (vanillin, caffeic acid, tyrosol, 
hydroxytyrosol, etc.) and flavonoids (luteolin, apigenin, and rutin, etc.) 
( Blasi et al., 2024 ).
Numerous studies on the safe and efficient addition of natural plant 
(extracts) to poultry feed to improve meat quality have increased ( Kon ´e 
et al., 2019 ; de Paiva et al., 2021 ). Dried OL is a powerful supplement 
that can be utilized to improve chicken in vivo industry growth and 
antioxidant capacity. Additionally, by-products of olives like olive cake 
were also widely used in poultry for a variety of phenolic components to 
enhance growth, quality of meat, and overall health ( Selim et al., 2021 ; 
Saleh and Alzawqari, 2021 ). According to Elhrech et al. (2024) , olive 
leaves include carbohydrates, trans fats, vitamins, minerals, and anti -
oxidants compounds that the body needs the most of. When combined, 
OL is a rich and moderate supplier of phenolic components that are now 
utilized in functional foods and animal husbandry. Therefore, this 
research aims to study the effect of adding olive leaf powder to broiler 
chicken feed on growth, carcass characteristics, blood characteristics, 
and intestinal bacterial count, in order to provide nutritious food.
Materials and methods
Design, birds and diets
This search was carried out at the Poultry Research Farm, Depart -
ment of Poultry, College of Agriculture, Zagazig University, Zagazig, 
Egypt. All experimental protocols were authorized by the Institutional 
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC) (ZU-IACUC/2/F/313/2023) 
and the Ethics of the Institutional Agency of the Poultry Department, 
Faculty of Agriculture, Zagazig University, Zagazig, Egypt.
In a completely randomized design experiment, 210 one-day-old 
broiler chicks (Arbor Acres) with about similar initial body weights 
(44.66 ± 0.17), were divided into three groups. Each was divided into 
seven replicates, each containing ten chicks. The trial lasted for thirty- 
one days. To meet the dietary requirements, the diets were created by 
guidelines for Arbor Acres broiler chicks, and amino acid (AA) 
management guidelines were taken into consideration when formu -
lating the diet. As indicated by Table 1 , all birds were given pellets for 
the first thirty-one days of their lives. There were two feeding stages: 
starter (one to 21 days) and finisher (22 to 31 days). Every bird was 
raised in the same environment. These were the treatments that were 
administered: control group (basal diet) not including additive. OLP1 
and OLP2 are the basal diet plus 1 and 2 g of olive leaf powder per kg of 
diet, respectively. The chicks were housed in semi-closed house and 
were kept in standard cages measuring 100 × 100 × 50 cm. The birds 
had ad libitum supply of water and feed. The water temperature for 
broiler chickens was maintained between 20
◦
C to 25
◦
C. The experi -
ment ’ s ambient temperature was maintained at 33
◦
C for the first week, 
30
◦
C for the second, and 26
◦
C till the end of the experiment. The 
experimental room ’ s relative humidity was maintained at 55 – 65 %. 
Throughout the experiment period, the chicks were also kept alive for 23 
hours under light and 1 hour without. Using LED lights with white light, 
with 20 – 40 lux during day 1 – 7, and 5 – 20 lux after day 7.
Plant materials
The olive leaves were supplied by a commercial enterprise. Quer -
cetin, gallic acid, methanol, ethanol, aluminum chloride, folin, and 
Ciocalteu ’ s phenol reagent (DPPH) 2, 2-Diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl and 
Merck were procured for chemical analysis (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, 
Germany).
Sample preparation
Ten grams of powdered olive leaves were combined with 200 mil -
liliters of 70 % methanol, stirred for three hours, and then filtered 
through Whatman No. 2 filter paper. After extracting methanol from an

◦
C, 
the extract was lyophilized using a Thermoelectron Corporation Heto 
power dry LL 300 freeze drier. The resulting extract was kept at 20
◦
C 
until it was used for the subsequent analyses (Abd El-Hack et al., 2017 ; 
Ashour et al., 2020 ). The methanolic extract (1000 mg/mL) extracted 
from each sample was used as the standard phenolic compound at 
different concentrations (10 – 1000 mg/mL) in order to estimate total 
phenolic compounds (TPCs) using the Folin – Ciocalteu method 
( S ´anchez-Rangel et al., 2013 ). Consequently, a standard curve was 
created, which is shown by the equation [y ¼ 0.001x þ 0.0563 (R2 ¼ 
0.9792)], where y and x stand for gallic acid absorbance and conden -
sation in milligrams per milliliter, respectively. Following the milli -
literation of each sample or standard gallic acid, two milliliters of 7.5 % 
sodium carbonate and three milliliters of diluted Folin-Ciocalteu were 
mixed. After that, the mixture was kept at 25
◦
C in the dark for 0.5 hours. 
A spectrophotometer (JENWAY, 6405 UV/Vis, U.K.) was used to 
quantify the blend absorbance at 760 nm ( Abdel-Shafi et al., 2019 ).
Total flavonoids (TFs) estimation
To determine the TFs content, the Ordonez et al. (2006) process was 
used. The normal curve for quercetin (10-1000 mg/mL), y = 0.0012x +
0.008 (R2 = 0.944), was used. One milliliter of extract or solution 
quercetin was combined with one milliliter of 20 g/L AlCl ₃ ethanol. The 
color intensity at 420 nm was measured using a spectrophotometer.
Antioxidant activity assessment
The antioxidant efficacy of the olive leaves methanolic extractor was 
assessed by its ability to scavenge the DPPH-assay ( Osman et al., 2014 ). 
One milliliter of each sample was mixed with three milliliters of 
methanolic-DPPH solution using a spectrophotometer. After 30 minutes 
of incubation, the absorbance at 520 nm (DPPH-assay) was determined. 
The extract condensation that scavenges 50 % of the DPPH and ABTS 
radicals (SC
50
) was determined.
Data collection
Each bird was weighed using an electronic scale once a week to 
determine its live body weight (LBW) and body weight gain (BWG) . 
Also, average daily feed intake (ADFI) , and feed conversion ratio (FCR) 
were computed cumulatively and by time. Every day, feed loss was 
noted, and feed intake was calculated using this information. When the 
experiment is over, seven chickens were taken at random from sepa -
rately group (1 bird / replicate), weighed (total 21 birds), and manually 
slaughtered, following Islamic tradition, which calls for cutting the ju -
gular vein with a sharp knife and allowing it to bleed for three to five 
minutes in accordance with ethical committee guidelines, when they 
were 31 days old in order to evaluate the carcasses. We calculated the 
weight of the carcass and the total amount of edible portions (breast, 
thigh, liver, heart, and gizzard). Carcass ( %) = (Weight of edible carcass 
/ Total weight of carcass) * 100. Dressing ( %) = (Weight of carcass / 
Live weight of bird) * 100.
Blood biochemical analysis
Following an overnight fast, seven birds in each group had their 
blood samples drawn at random and put into tubes devoid of heparin. 
Serum was extracted from the samples by centrifuging them for 15 mi -
nutes at 4
◦
C at 5000 rpm. It was then kept at -20
◦
C until biochemical 
analysis. The levels of total protein (TP) , albumin (ALB) , globulin 
(Glob) , alanine transaminase (ALT) , and aspartate transaminase (AST) , 
and total cholesterol (TC) , triglycerides (TG) , low-density lipoprotein 
(LDL) , high-density lipoprotein (HDL) , and very low-density lipoprotein 
(VLDL) . In addition, creatinine and immunological response (IgG, IgM) 
were measured concurring to the commercial kits ’ manufacturer ’ s 
guidelines ( Youssef et al., 2023a ). According to the previous work (Abd 
El-Hack et al., 2017 ), the activities of oxidative status parameters such as 
malondialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were 
ascertained.
Microbiological analysis
Following the removal of the cecum from seven birds in each group, 
ten grams of the cecum sample were homogenized in ninety milliliters of 
sterile peptone water and agitated for thirty minutes. Serial dilutions 
(10 ⁻ ¹ to 10 ⁻⁷ ) of the supernatant were made ( Youssef et al., 2024b ). 
According to Oxoid (2006), the total bacterial count (TBC) , Coliform, 
Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp., Clostridium, Lactobacilli, Lactococci , and 
Bacillus spp., and were counted on certain medium. Log CFU/g was used 
to convert the bacterial counts.
Statistical analysis
GLM procedure of SAS was utilized to apply an ANOVA approach 
with a complete randomized design on the data ( SAS Institute Inc., 
2001 ). The post-hoc Tukey ’ s assay was utilized to ascertain the variation 
amongst means. Unless otherwise indicated, claims of statistical signif -
icance were predicated on P < 0.05. The statistical model utilized was as 
follows: 
Y
ij
= μ + T
i

where Ti is the treatment effect, Yij is the value that was observed of the 
treatment under consideration, μ is the observed mean for the treatment 
under consideration, and eij is the error associated with a single 
observation.

of feeding diet supplemented with 1 g and 2 g of OLP at 29 – 31 day and 
1 – 31 days of age respectively comparing to untreated group. FCR was 
significantly reduced by using 1 g and 2 g OLP at 15 – 21 days of age 
comparable to the untreated treatment. Further, FCR was significantly 
increasing when feeding on 2 g OLP at 29 – 31 days and 1 – 31 days of 
age compared to the other level and control group.
Carcass features
Table 7 inferred a significant increasing on dressing percentage and 
breast percentage due to feeding 2 g OLP compared to other level of OLP 
and control group. Carcass percentage was significantly increment due 
to feeding 1 g and 2 g of OLP comparing with untreated group. On the 
other hand, abdominal fat was reduced significantly when birds feeding 
of OLP concentrations in comparison with untreated group, but no 
considerable effects on thigh, liver, heart, gizzard and giblets percent -
ages by OLP supplement.
Blood parameters
Table 8 illustrated the serum TP, ALB, Glob, A/G ratio, ALT, AST, 
creatinine, TC, LDL, TG and VLDL of broilers in the different experi -
mental categories. Serum TP, ALB and Glob were significantly increased 
when birds feeding of 2 g OLP and (1 g and 2 g OLP), respectively 
compared to the control group. On contrary, ALT, Creat, TC, TG and 
VLDL were significantly reduced due to OLP levels comparing with the 
control group. However, no considerable effects were observed on A/G 
ratio, AST, HDL and LDL due to OLP supplementation.
Immunity and antioxidant parameters
Outcomes in Table 9 exhibit that IgG, IgM and SOD were improved 
significantly ( P < 0.05) because of feeding of 2 g OLP comparison to 1 g 
group and control group. Nevertheless, MDA was significantly reduced 
by all levels of OLP supplementation comparing to control group.
Microbial analysis of the broiler cecum
The cecal microbial count in response to various OLP treatments is 
shown in Fig. 1 . Variations in the total bacterial count (TBC) were sig -
nificant ( P < 0.05). The OLP groups showed the maximum TBC levels. 
The higher levels of Lactobacilli, Lactococci , and Bacillus spp. were seen in 
the OLP groups supplemented with 1 or 2 g of OLP, suggesting positive 
effects on gut health. Interestingly, in comparison with other treatments, 
the control group exhibited the highest levels of E. coli, Salmonella, 
Clostridium , and Coliform .
Discussion
Low scavenging capacity 50 % (SC50) values are indicative of high 
antioxidant activity ( Osman et al., 2019 ). The antioxidant potential of a 
variety of meals is supported by polyphenol aggregation ( Acidri et al., 
2020 ). Oleuropein, hydroxytyrosol, and flavonoids are the main bioac -
tive substances found in olive leaves; they prevent food from oxidizing 
on its own ( Adel et al., 2024 ). All of the derivatives of the olive tree ( Olea 
europaea L.) are rich in polyphenols. Compared to olive fruit and olive 
oil, the quantities of total phenols in olive leaves and leaf extract are 
even higher ( Finicelli et al., 2021 ). Furthermore, the olive leaf has long 
been utilized as a basic material in phytotherapy. Numerous experi -
mental, clinical, and epidemiological studies have identified poly -
phenols from virgin olive oil, olive leaves, and leaf extract, as well as 
other polyphenols derived from the olive tree, as substances that can 
have a variety of positive effects on the body, particularly when 
consumed over an extended period of time ( Bucciantini et al., 2021 ). 
Oleuropein, oleocanthal, oleacein, hydroxytyrosol, and tyrosol are the 
polyphenols that have been studied the most.
Numerous studies have demonstrated the antioxidant qualities of 
OLP polyphenols and their potential to combat oxidative stress in brain 
tissues via a variety of methods. For instance, hydroxytyrosol and 
oleocanthal are strong cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitors, but oleuropein

and hydroxytyrosol scavenge free radicals. Furthermore, oleuropein 
prevents LDL from oxidizing ( Beauchamp et al., 2005 ). Due to its ability 
to donate electrons, oleuropein primarily scavenges free radicals to 
demonstrate its strong antioxidant activity. Actually, the hydroxyl 
groups in oleuropein ’ s molecular structure work as hydrogen donors, 
preventing oxidation. Its benefits include limiting neuroinflammation 
by lowering the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines 
and boosting the brain ’ s antioxidant capacity ( Butt et al., 2021 ).
Olive leaves are an excellent way to boost the growth of livestock and 
poultry ( Adel et al., 2024 ). Our outcomes were likeness with Almu -
hayawi et al (2023) who found that final body weight (FBW) had a 
significant influence in all groups fed diverse additives of OLP 
comparing to untreated group. Amini et al (2019) noticed that birds 
feeding the diet provided of 0.25 % OL had the best BWG than the 
control birds in the starter period, but dietary supplemented levels 0.25, 
0.50 and 0.75 % of OL lead to a significant increment in BWG through 
22-42 days and 1-42 days. Also, Agah et al (2019) indicated that birds 
having OL dietary supplementation at 200 mg/kg diet had the higher 
BW comparison to other groups. Further, Nassar et al (2019) recorded 
the best body weight gain in the treats that feeding on diet contain of 2.0 
% olive leaves powder, but the control group had the lowest values. 
Similar to this, studies by Bahs ¸ i et al. (2016) , Ait-Kaki et al. (2018) , and 
Nafea and Hussein (2018) showed that adding OLP to broiler feed at a 
rate of 20 or 25 g/kg diet greatly boosted the amount of BWG.
The powdered olive leaves include phenolic components that func -
tion similarly to steroid hormones. Hormone steroids and phenolic 
compounds increase basal metabolic rate and improve feed absorption, 
which increases diet nutrient consumption ( Esenbuga and Ekinci, 2023 ). 
Olive leaf powder has demonstrated encouraging benefits on broiler 
body weight. It is rich in bioactive components including as oleuropein, 
hydroxytyrosol, and flavonoids. Compounds found in olive leaves can 
aid in reducing inflammation, which has a detrimental effect on feed 
efficiency and growth. Furthermore, olive leaf powder can help main -
tain a healthy intestinal environment, which is necessary for nutrient 
absorption, by lowering inflammation ( Adel et al., 2024 ).
Also, parallel findings were noticed by Nassar et al. (2019) who 
pointed that the best FCR was found in the group that having diet sup -
plemented with 2.0 % OLP, while fewer values were noticed in the 
control birds. Also, Nafea and Hussein (2018) notified that, the OLP 
supplementation at level 20 or 25 g/kg diet to broiler diets was 
enhanced FCR. Also, Erener et al. (2020) recorded that birds that feeding 
of 600 mg/ kg of OLE had the highest FI comparing to the control group. 
Furthermore, there was a considerably improving in FCR by 300 and 
600 mg OLE of broilers in comparison with control, OLE 75 mg, and 
OLE150 mg group.
The primary chemicals in dietary olive leaves are oleuropein and 
polyphenols, which may provide certain health benefits ( Ronca et al., 
2024 ). There are numerous phenolic components found in olive leaves 
( Agah et al., 2019 ). The primary phenolic component in olive oils is 
oleeuropein ( Debbou-Iouknane et al., 2021 ). Oke et al. (2017) demon -
strated that the biological effects of the phenolic components found in 
olive leaves in previous studies include analgesic, anti-inflammatory, 
antioxidant, antibacterial, antitumor, and anticancer characteristics.
Moreover, our outcomes were similarity with Erener et al. (2020)
who found that carcass and dressing percentage of chickens feeding of 
600 mg olive leaf extract (OLE) was higher than those in the other 
groups, and control birds. While, the abdominal fat was lower in the 
control birds than in all OLE birds. Also, no significant influenced were 
noticed in weight of liver, spleen, and heart in all treatment categories 
feeding of 50, 75, 100, 125, and 150 mg/g of OLP comparing with 
control birds, while the significant difference on carcass weight showed 
in 100 mg/g OLP in contrast with control. But the abdominal fat was 
significantly lowered in 75, 100, 125 and 150 mg /g OLP in comparison 
to control group ( Almuhayawi et al., 2023 ). On contrary, El-Damarawy 
et al. (2013) showed that, birds having 2 % dietary olive leaves reduced 
significantly weight of liver comparing to the untreated birds. 
Conversely, Shafey et al. (2013) notified that eviscerated carcass weight 
and its compounds of birds that slaughtered at 21 and 36 days of age did 
not affect significantly when feeding of diet supplemented with OLE. 
Additionally, Jabri et al. (2017) found that the supplementation of two 
doses of OLE (10ml/L and 20ml/L) to the water didn ’ t impact on most of 
carcass attributes.
Furthermore, our finding was parallel with Nassar et al. (2019) who 
recorded that TP and Glob were increased significantly, whereas A/G 
ratio were reduced significantly in birds that fed diet with 2 % OLP in 
comparison to control birds. These findings are aligned with Nafea and 
Hussein (2018) who found a significantly increasing in serum TP and 
Glob levels of birds fed 2 % olive leaves supplementation. While, serum 
TC and TG levels of chicks were significantly reduced when consumed a 
diet complemented with OLP when compared to untreated birds. Also, 
Ait-Kaki et al. (2018) declared that no considerable influence on TG 
levels by adding several of olive leaves levels to broiler feed. Also, Xie 
et al. (2022) reported that, olive leaf extract didn ’ t make any consid -
erable influence on serum concentrations of TC, LDL, HDL, and creati -
nine in the broilers. However, Sarica and Toptas (2014) noticed that 
decreasing on serum TC and LDL concentrations by dietary supple -
mentation with 200 mg kg   1 oleuropein in quail. Almuhayawi, et al. 
(2023) indicated that lipid profiles and ALT or AST levels were improved 
by feeding of OLP compared to untreated group. Further, Agah et al. 
(2019) found that reduction of TC, TG, ALT, and AST of birds that 
feeding diets include of OLP. Also, Parsaei et al (2014) obtained that a 
significantly decreased in blood cholesterol, HDL, LDL and VLDL by 
dietary supplementation of olive leaf at level 0.5 and 0.75 % comparable 
to control group.
Compounds found in olive leaves have the capability to prevent the 
release of inflammatory moderators and cytokines, which lessens 
inflammation in the kidneys and liver ( Sahnoun et al., 2024 ). Also, the 
antioxidants in olive leaf powder can shield these organs from oxidative 
stress-related harm. Additionally, the normal function of kidney and 
liver cells can be preserved by using olive leaf powder, which reduces 
oxidative stress and inflammation. Furthermore, chemicals found in 
olive leaves may improve the liver ’ s capacity to metabolize harmful 
compounds, lessening the load on the kidneys ( de Oliveira et al., 2024 ). 
Among of the polyphenols in OL is oleeuropein, is a powerful

antioxidant. As lipid peroxidation destroys cell membranes and can 
result in raised cholesterol levels, they can counteract dangerous free 
radicals that contribute to this process ( Gonçalves et al., 2024 ). Also, 
olive leaf chemicals could inhibit with the assimilation of dietary 
cholesterol in the guts. This could be achieved through processes like 
attaching to cholesterol or affecting bile acid metabolism. According to 
Shahidi and Danielski (2024) , some polyphenols found in olive leaves 
may encourage the liver to create more bile acids, which may aid in the 
body ’ s removal of cholesterol. Hepatic cholesterol production is

decreased by oleeuropein’s inhibition of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl- -
CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase, the enzyme that limits the rate of choles -
terol biosynthesis ( Gnoni et al., 2021 ). Additionally, polyphenols inhibit 
the synthesis of fatty acids and triglycerides by suppressing the expres -
sion of genes such as fatty acid synthase (FAS) and sterol regulatory 
element-binding protein 1c (SREBP-1c) ( Qin et al., 2023 ). According to 
Tahri-Joutey et al. (2021) , OLP increases lipid breakdown for energy by 
activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha (PPAR- α ), 
a nuclear receptor that stimulates fatty acid β-oxidation in mitochondria 
and peroxisomes. Furthermore, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) 
is triggered by hydroxytyrosol, which causes metabolism to shift from 
lipid storage to fatty acid oxidation ( Munteanu et al., 2025 ).
Additionally, our results were similarity with Oke et al. (2017) and 
Ahmed et al. (2017) who noticed a significantly decreased of MDA 
concentration because of adding various levels of OLP to broiler diets. 
Hayes et al. (2011) suggested that the antioxidant advantages of OL 
correspond to phenolic compounds which constitute free radical scav -
enger by preventing the free radical chain reaction. Furthermore, a 
number of chemicals found in OL and OLE have been reported by Silva 
et al. (2006) and Jemai et al. (2008) to potentially function as sources of 
antioxidants. Additionally, hens fed OLE exhibited a considerable rise in 
SOD plasma levels and a significant drop in MDA concentrations ( Oke 
et al., 2017 ).
Agah et al. (2019) noticed that OLE can provide antioxidant pro -
tection and reduced lipid peroxidation and this can enhance broilers’ 
health and redox status. Furthermore, El-Damarawy et al. (2013) real -
ized that an improvement of most of immunity and biochemical traits of 
Mandarah chick when feeding of OLP at the level of 2.0 %. Christaki 
et al. (2004) observed that olive leaf contains flavonoids, these com -
ponents are able improve the immunity status of chicken. The body’s 
natural defense against oxidative stress may be strengthened by the 
utilization of OLP, which might increase the synthesis of antioxidant 
enzymes like SOD. OLP may also assist in stabilizing cell membranes, 
which would lessen the likelihood of lipid peroxidation and, in turn, 
lower MDA levels ( Al-Shammari and Zamil, 2024 ). In order to avoid 
oxidative damage to lipids, proteins, and DNA, oleeuropein and 
hydroxytyrosol give electrons to neutralize reactive oxygen species 
(ROS), such as hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂), hydroxyl radicals (OH⁻), and 
superoxide anions (O₂⁻) ( Gonçalves et al., 2024 ). Furthermore, poly -
phenols suppress Fenton processes that produce dangerous free radicals 
by binding to iron (Fe²⁺) and copper (Cu²⁺) ( Ohiagu et al., 2024 ).
In the present study, OLP drastically reduced the quantity of caeca 
pathogens and raised the number of beneficial bacteria. These outcomes 
were consistent with those of Abdel-Kader et al. (2024) , who discovered 
that the most effective activity against intestinal pathogenic bacteria 
was exhibited by an OLP at a concentration of 300, and 600 ppm /kg diet 
for growing Japanese quail. Additionally, it greatly accelerates Lacto -
bacilli growth. Bioactive substances with potent antibacterial qualities, 
including as hydroxytyrosol, flavonoids, and oleuropein, are found in 
OLP. These substances have the ability to damage bacterial cell mem -
branes, which can result in bacterial mortality and the leaking of cellular 
contents ( Alowaiesh et al., 2023 ). Certain phenolic substances inhibit 
bacterial growth and metabolism by interfering with their enzymatic 
systems ( Nemzer et al., 2025 ). Furthermore, several bioactive sub -
stances found in olive leaves have the ability to prevent bacterial 
communication, or quorum sensing, which lessens the capacity of 
pathogens to create biofilms and spread illnesses ( Arrigoni et al., 2024 ). 
As prebiotics, the fiber and polyphenols in OLP promote the growth of 
good bacteria, such as Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium ( Plamada and 
Vodnar, 2021 ). Additionally, probiotic-induced improved fermentation 
raises short-chain fatty acids (SCFA), such as butyrate, which support 
intestinal cells and prevent the formation of pathogens ( Al-Smadi et al., 
2023 ).
Conclusions
Based on the findings of this study, supplementing broiler chicken 
diets with OLP at concentrations of 1 g and 2 g per kilogram of feed 
significantly enhanced overall growth performance, involving LBW and 
FCR. Furthermore, the addition of OLP positively influenced the birds’ 
lipid profiles, evidenced by a decrease in TC, TG, and VLDL concentra -
tions, contributing to improved cardiovascular health. The supplemen -
tation also bolstered immune function and increased antioxidant 
capacity, suggesting enhanced disease resistance and better protection 
against oxidative stress. Also, the OLP supplementation improved the 
number of beneficial bacteria and reduced the number of pathogens 
bacteria, suggesting boosted disease resistance and improved the overall 
health of birds. These results strongly support the potential of OLP as a 
natural, effective alternative to antibiotics, promoting both growth and 
health in broiler production systems. The use of OLP could serve as a 
sustainable strategy in poultry nutrition, fostering healthier birds while 
addressing consumer demand for antibiotic-free meat products.
