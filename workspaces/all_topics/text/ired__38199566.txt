Imine reductases (IREDs) and reductive aminases have been
used in the synthesis of chiral amine products for drug
manufacturing; however, little is known about their biological
contexts. Here we employ structural studies and site-directed
mutagenesis to interrogate the mechanism of the IRED RedE
from the biosynthetic pathway to the indolocarbazole natural
product reductasporine. Cocrystal structures with the
substrate-mimic arcyriaﬂavin A reveal an extended active site
cleft capable of binding two indolocarbazole molecules. Site-
directed mutagenesis of a conserved aspartate in the primary
binding site reveals a new role for this residue in anchoring the
substrate above the NADPH cofactor. Variants targeting the
secondary binding site greatly reduce catalytic efﬁciency, while
accumulating oxidized side-products. As indolocarbazole
biosynthetic intermediates are susceptible to spontaneous
oxidation, we propose the secondary site acts to protect against
autooxidation, and the primary site drives catalysis through
precise substrate orientation and desolvation effects. The
structure of RedE with its extended active site can be the
starting point as a new scaffold for engineering IREDs and
reductive aminases to intercept large substrates relevant to
industrial applications.
Imine reductases (IREDs) (1, 2) have drawn considerable
interest for their application as biocatalysts in the synthesis of
pharmaceuticals (3– 6). IREDs can be used in chiral amine
syntheses starting from imines (7, 8) or amine-ketone pairs (9).
They are valued for their ability to create secondary and ter-
tiary chiral amines, as well as catalyzing reductive amination
(6, 10). Recently, two reductive aminases (RedAms) have been
engineered to produce industrially useful amounts of drug
candidates (11, 12). However, with the focus on industrial
applications and engineering of IREDs, the study of these en-
zymes in their natural context has been neglected.
RedE, an IRED, serves as a biosynthetic enzyme in the for-
mation of the indolocarbazole natural product reductasporine
(13). Indolocarbazoles have been a rich source of potential
chemotherapeutics with many entering clinical trials for ac-
tivity against cancers (14), and the semisynthetic staurosporine
derivative, midostaurin, was approved in 2017 as an anticancer
treatment (15). In theﬁeld of biosynthesis, a number of studies
have highlighted the shared features of indolocarbazole as-
sembly, with initial steps catalyzed by a core set of oxidative
enzymes, followed by the action of diverse tailoring enzymes
(16). Each indolocarbazole gene cluster preserves three genes
coding for an FAD-dependent tryptophan oxidase (redO, rebO,
and staO), a heme-containing chromopyrrolic acid (CPA)
synthase (redD, rebD, and staD) and a cytochrome P450
indolocarbazole synthase (redP, rebP, and staP)( Fig. S1). The
tryptophan oxidase ﬁrst converts two
L-tryptophan molecules
to the corresponding imines before CPA synthase couples the
two imines at the Cβ position (17). The indole-3-pyruvate
imine dimer spontaneously cyclizes into CPA (18, 19). The
indolocarbazole synthase oxidatively bridges the indole C2
positions yielding a proposed dicarboxy indolocarbazole in-
termediate (4) ( 20, 21). This indolocarbazole is prone to
decarboxylation and oxidation and has not yet been directly
detected. Several indolocarbazole biosynthetic gene clusters
encode unique enzymes that capture and stabilize an indolo-
carbazole decomposition product before promoting the for-
mation of a more stable compound for further tailoring
(22– 26). For example, the rebeccamycin biosynthetic enzyme
RebC and the homologous staurosporine biosynthetic enzyme
StaC capture reactive intermediates and funnel them toward
the 8- and 4-electron oxidation products, respectively
(Fig. S1B). The trapping of distinct tautomers of 7-carboxy-
K252c in crystals of RebC and in RebC-10x, an enzyme with
StaC-like activity, suggest that careful control of the hybridi-
zation at the C7 position can enable simple decarboxylation in
the keto tautomer to staurosporine aglycone K252c (in the
case of StaC) or decarboxylation after hydroxylation of the
enol tautomer to arcyriaﬂavin A (AFA) (in the case of RebC)
(23, 25).
The reductasporine gene cluster was discovered while
screening the metagenomes of soil samples for CPA synthase-
like genes (13). Chang et al. reconstituted this pathway in
Escherichia coli and proposed RedE reduces the 5,7-
didehydro-N,N-didemethylreductasporine ( 3) to dideme-
thylreductasporine (2)( Fig. 1). This proposal is based on the
propensity of the dicarboxyindolocarbazole intermediate4 to
spontaneously decarboxylate at physiological conditions,
although 3 was not detected directly (13, 20). Recently, our
group reconstituted reductasporine biosynthesisin vitro (27),
reproducing the RedE-dependent formation of2 from indo-
locarbazole synthase products and subsequent methylationvia

RedM to reductasporine (1). In analogy to the role of the StaC/
RebC enzymes, RedE captures a reactive intermediate from the
indolocarbazole biosynthetic pathway; however, it catalyzes a
reduction rather than an oxidation. Based on these biochem-
ical data, RedE would have to intercept an intermediate while
not allowing for oxidation, indicating a novel mechanism.
Here, we present crystal structures of RedE, including apo,
NADP
+-bound and two ternary complexes with AFA and
NADP(H). These crystal structures reveal an unexpected
secondary indolocarbazole binding site adjoined to the primary
active site, and site-directed mutagenesis shows both are
critical for catalysis. Our biochemical characterization of StaP
reaction products reveals the accumulation and decomposition
of 3, and we propose that RedE intercepts and reduces3 from
solution. The secondary active site may protect the indolo-
carbazole from oxidation and select for the catalytically
compatible isoindole tautomer before direct transfer to the
primary site for reduction. Close inspection of the secondary
indolocarbazole binding site and comparison to other struc-
turally characterized IREDs suggest potential sequence de-
terminants that would favor the formation of this cleft,
indicating wider implications on the malleability of IRED
active sites.
Results
RedE crystal diffraction dataset phasing, twinning, and initial
model building
We solved the apo, binary complex and two ternary com-
plex structures of RedE with NADP
+ and AFA to resolutions
of 1.60 to 1.63 Å (Table 1, Fig. 2). The diffraction dataset
phases for these models were solvedvia molecular replace-
ment using a selenomethionine-substituted RedE model
(SeMet-RedE), which was itself phasedvia single anomalous
dispersion of selenium atoms. Twinning was detected in
SeMet-RedE and apo-RedE crystal datasets. The second
moment of intensity (CI
2D/CID2) reaches 1.78 (untwinned: 2.0,
perfect twin: 1.5) and average local intensity differences,C|L|D,
0.43 (untwinned: 0.5, perfect twin: 0.375). The L-test for
twinning identiﬁes a twin fraction as high as 23%. When a
monoclinic unit cell fulﬁlls any condition β ≈ 90/C14,a ≈ c, or
2c⋅cos β ≈− a it is possible to form a pseudomerohedral twin
(28– 30). The cell dimensions of the P 21 space group crystals
of SeMet-RedE and apo-RedE meet the third condition, and a
model can be solved for using the appropriate twin law
(h, −k, −h−l). The resulting SeMet-RedE model arranges as a
pair of dimers in the asymmetric unit. In several chains,α11
(residues 256– 278) has too poor electron density to model
completely, and another 16 residues in several loop regions are
also missing (Fig. S2). Nonetheless, this model is sufﬁcient to
solve for phases via molecular replacement in other RedE
diffraction datasets. RedE cocrystals with NADP
+ and AFA
were not affected by twinning.
Structure of RedE
RedE resembles the canonical IRED fold with an N-terminal
NADPH-binding Rossmann domain and a C-terminal helical
bundle mediating homodimerization (8– 10, 31). The N-ter-
minal Rossmann domain (residues 2– 161) consists of an eight-
stranded β-sheet with the ﬁrst six strands ( β1-6) running
parallel and the following two strands (β7-8) antiparallel. Each
parallel strand is bounded by anα helix (α1-7) forming βαβ
motifs and a 3
10-helix forms in the loop between the anti-
parallel β6 and β7 strands (Fig. 2A). The common Rossmann
domain GxGxxG nucleotide binding motif is preserved at
residues 9 to 14 (GLGPMG) (32). The C-terminal domain
(residues 193– 288) is a ﬁve-membered helical bundle where
the latter fourα-helices (α9-12) wrap around the interdomain
helix of its dimer partner (αʹ8) forming an extensive 4020 Å
2
interface (27% of total monomer surface area) between both
N- and C-terminal domains as calculated by PISA software
(33). A total of 22 and 79 residues are involved in polar and
hydrophobic contacts, respectively (Fig. 2B). The majority of
these interactions are within the dimerization domains with
only 17 residues interfacing between N- and C-terminal do-
mains. Hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions occur
between E153 to Rʹ209, D160 to Gʹ195, and T121 and S123 to
Eʹ234. The N-terminal end ofα6 is associated with an iodide
ion which is in turn stabilized by Rʹ254. The majority of the
hydrophobic contacts between the two domains are found

indolocarbazole synthase catalyzes the bridging of the C2 positions from each indole in CPA. The simplest substrate for RedE is 5,7-didehydro-N,N-
didemethylreductasporine (3), which is proposed to be reduced to didemethylreductasporine (2) before methylation to1 via SAM-dependent methyl-
transferase, RedM. The indolocarbazole synthase requires coenzymes ferredoxin (FDX) and ferredoxin reductase (FDR) powered by NAD(P)H for activity.

between β6-8 and αʹ9 where M119, Y130, L131, L133, M155,
and L157 interlock with V ʹ206, Rʹ209, Wʹ210, and Tʹ213.
Lastly, residues at the N-terminal ends ofα6 and the inter-
domain helix (P96, V97, A162, and M163) stack against the
loop between the C-terminal end of the dimer partner ’s
interdomain helix andαʹ9, speciﬁcally Pʹ195 and Gʹ196.
Datasets from crystals of RedE grown with 10 mM NADP
+
produce F o– Fc electron density omit maps that can be
unambiguously modelled as NADP+ (Fig. S3A). The cofactor
binds a broad cleft formed from the conﬂuence ofα1, α2, and
β1-5 with the characteristic GxGxxG NADPH binding
sequence found at the center betweenβ1 andα1 (9-GLGPMG-
14) with hydrogen bonds forming between the C5ʹ-phosphate
and M13 amide N-H and an ordered water held between the
amide nitrogen atoms of G11 and G14 and C65 amide
carbonyl (Fig. 3A). The adenosine C2ʹ-phosphate is held in
place by a salt bridge with R33 alongside hydrogen bonds with
Q32, T34, and K37. The adenine ring rests against the A71 side
chain and is parallel stacked with the R33 guanidino group.
E74 hydrogen bonds to the adenine C6-amine. The backbone
N-H of A67 hydrogen bonds with the adenosine furan oxygen,
while the S83 side chain and L66 backbone carbonyl and
interact with the C2ʹ- and C3ʹ-hydroxyl of the nicotinamide
riboside, respectively. The re-face of the nicotinamide C4 is
positioned overtop the side chain of M13 with the si-face
facing into a deep pocket formed at the dimer interface of
the C-terminal helical bundle. Comparison of the apo and
binary structures show that R33 moves out of the adenine
binding area in order to stack against the purine ring while
forming a salt bridge to the nearby 2ʹ-phosphate.
As the substrate and products of RedE are transiently stable,
we elected to use AFA as a mimic, because it shares the planar
indolocarbazole core of3. Processing diffraction data of RedE
crystallized from solutions with 1.2 mM AFA and 10 mM
NADP
+ show electron density consistent with both AFA and
NADP+ in each protomer (Fig. S3, A and B). In this structure,
the positioning of NADP+ is similar to that observed in the
binary complex. AFA sits above thesi-face of the nicotinamide
C4 with the maleimide carbonyl situated 3 Å away in a ge-
ometry ideal for hydride transfer. AFA is enveloped by a highly
hydrophobic pocket lined with M119, T121, L172, M175,
W210ʹ, F217ʹ, F235ʹ, L239ʹ, T243,ʹ and I246ʹ, and anchored
within it via interactions to D168 with each indole nitrogen
(Fig. 3C). Lastly, the guanidine group of R242 hydrogen bonds
to the maleimide carbonyl.
In structures solved from RedE crystals formed in a solution
with only 1.2 mM AFA, we observe electron density consistent
with AFA binding the cleft adjoined to the hydrophobic active
site pocket (Fig. S3C). This secondary binding cleft forms be-
tween β5, α6, andα8 of the Rossmann domain andαʹ10 from
the C-terminal helical bundle. AFA forms hydrogen bonds
from each indole N-H to T169 and a water molecule held
between the S165 carbonyl and the D168 sidechain (Fig. 3B).
In one protomer, H249 may form a weak hydrogen bond to the

nearby maleimide carbonyl (3.5 Å). AFA makes hydrophobic
contacts with G94, S95, P96, I246, A250, and L253, and the
G94 peptide carbonyl is held in place with a hydrogen bond to
the S165 side chain. An iodide ion bounded by the positive
dipole N-terminal end of α4 and R254 completes the outer
boundary of the cleft. Despite not including NADP
+ in the
preparation of these crystals, electron density is consistent
with the presence of NADP(H) cofactor retained during pu-
riﬁcation. The electron density has poorer deﬁnition than that
of the RedE-NADP
+ or RedE-NADP+-AFA structures and can
be modeled by partial occupancy of an NADP + cofactor
(Fig. S3A). Additionally, there is sparse electron density above
the nicotinamide moiety resembling partial occupancy of AFA
in the same pose as characterized in the RedE-NADP+-AFA
ternary structure (Fig. S3B). The density is a poor ﬁt, and
modeling either AFA or water in this area produces similar
R
free values. Furthermore, placing an AFA molecule in the
active site clashes with the clearly deﬁned position of the AFA
molecule in the secondary binding cleft. Placing both indolo-
carbazoles in the active site simultaneously forces a contact
between indole rings of less than 2 Å, which is too small to
represent simultaneous binding. Modeling this relation as
alternate conformations results in occupancy of 55 to 60% in
the distal cleft. This feature may result from heterogeneity in
binding conﬁgurations throughout the crystal.
Resemblance to other NAD(P)H-dependent reductases
Secondary structure searching via PDBeFOLD (34) shows
RedE’s closest structural matches are other IREDs and
RedAms (Fig. S4). These are deﬁned by the reciprocal domain
swapping of each monomer ’s C-terminal helical bundle.
However, compared to all other IREDs and RedAms RedE has
a pronounced crescent shape imparted by the secondary
indolocarbazole binding cleft formed between αʹ10 of the
dimerization domain and α6 of the Rossmann domain. In
other IREDs this is a tighter binding interface between pro-
tomers, yet buried surface area calculations indicate similar
contact areas between 3900 and 4600 Å
2 (4020 Å2 in RedE).
The loss of close contacts betweenαʹ10 and α6 in RedE are
supplemented with dimer interactions found at the loop be-
tween α8 andα9 set against the N-terminal ends ofαʹ6 andαʹ8
of its dimer partner in addition to closer interactions between
the β-sheet in the Rossmann domain andαʹ9 in the dimer-
ization domain. This extra surface area may provide support to
maintain the separation between the domains.

The next closest structural matches are from theβ-hydroxy
acid dehydrogenase ( βHAD) family, which include 3-
hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase (35), L-serine dehydroge-
nase (36) among several other characterized enzymes (Fig. S4)
(37, 38). These share an N-terminal Rossmann NAD(P)H
binding domain and a C-terminal helical bundle mediating
dimerization; however, a sharp turn in the helix following the
interdomain helix (α9 in RedE) redirects the chain back toward
the Rossmann domain resulting in no reciprocal domain
swapping (35). Despite this large deviation, the backbone
traces of the overall quaternary structure of the dimer is
maintained between IREDs and βHADs. The related 6-
phosphogluconate dehydrogenases shares a similar fold to
βHADs, where the helical bundle of a 6-phosphogluconate
dehydrogenases protomer has a circa 130 amino acid C-ter-
minal extension which replicates the fold of an interacting
βHAD dimer (39).
RedE has sparing, but notable, structural similarity with
pyrroline-5-carboxylate reductases (40) and prephenate de-
hydrogenases (Fig. S4)( 41). These enzymes share a similar
layout to IREDs and βHADs with an N-terminal Rossmann
binding domain and C-terminal helical bundle mediating
dimerization. They even share a similar presence or lack of
reciprocal domain swapping resulting from a sharp turn in an
α-helix in the dimerization domain. However, the organization
of the helical dimerization bundle is substantially different
with several helices following the long axis of the enzyme
rather than being arranged perpendicular to it.
Domain contacts among IRED and RedAm enzymes
Of the 16 unique IRED and RedAm hits from secondary
structure matching using the RedE protomer, the median
RMSD of C
α atoms is 2.76 Å covering 93% of residues in RedE
(Table S1). Among these enzymes RedE is the only one to have
an extended loop betweenα8 andα9 which interacts with the
Rossmann domain of its partner monomer (Fig. 4A). Searching
the Protein Data Bank (PDB) for all IREDs and RedAms shows
that this is an unique feature to RedE and is an apparent
insertion of four residues (194-PGGN-197).AtRedAm has a
two residue insertion in this loop; however, the area does not
interact with the neighbouring Rossmann domain ( 42).
Extending the search to primary sequence matches in the
UniProt database shows that this“PGGN” loop is found in ten
other IRED-like enzymes, though the insertion may be more
accurately described as residues 193-GPGG-196 (Fig. 4B). This
loop interacts closely with P96, V97, D160, A162, and M163 in
the Rossmann domain where P96 and D160 are conserved
positions among structurally characterized IREDs (Fig. S5).
Among more closely related sequences to RedE, the V97

position is found as a hydrophobic residue when the“GPGG”
insertion is present and as a glutamate when it is not.
AlphaFold predicts these loops adopt a similar conformation
to RedE and each predicted assembly possess a cleft between
α6 and αʹ10 (43).
The sequence alignment of helixα10 indicates no residues are
strongly conserved among all IREDs, while the loop spanningβ5
and α6 is often conserved as [ST][ST] x [ST]P (Fig. S5). Among
structurally characterized IREDs and RedAms a histidine or
asparagine is often found at I246 in RedE and is involved in
cross-domain contacts (Fig. 4B). This position is exclusively
found as a hydrophobic residue in other IRED-like sequences
with a“GPGG” insertion betweenα8 andα9.
Detection of new StaP indolocarbazole products
Previous characterization of StaP reaction products assayed
mixtures after 3 h (22), and given the known propensity for these
compounds to decompose quickly, we surmised we mayﬁnd
new compounds produced closer to the start of the reaction. We
used an one-pot reaction where the RedE substrate is createdin
situ from CPA by the indolocarbazole synthase StaP withSyn-
echococcus elongatuselectron transport coenzymes ferredoxin
(FDX) and ferredoxin reductase (FDR) (22, 44). Production of
reductasporine and StaP products, K252c (5, staurosporine
aglycone), 7-hydroxy-K252c (6), and AFA are veriﬁed via high-
resolution mass and UV-visual absorbance spectra (Table S2).
Each indolocarbazole has a diagnostic UV-visual absorbance
spectrum with λ
max ≈ 290 to 300 nm ( 13, 45, 46). After
quenching these reactions with acetonitrile at 0, 4, 8, 15, 30, and
160 min we see the accumulation and depletion of a new com-
pound with mass consistent with3 ([M + H]

nonspeciﬁc oxidation due to hydrogen peroxide released during
incomplete turnover of the StaP cofactor system does not alter
the compound’s accumulation or lifespan (Fig. S6B). This new
compound is accompanied by the detection of two additional,
low abundance indolocarbazole compounds with molecular
formulas attributable to 6,7-didehydro-K252c ([M + H]
+ =
310.09755 m/z, 0.19 ppm) and 7-carboxy-6,7-didehydro-K252c
([M + H]
+ = 354.08724 m/z, 0.25 ppm) (Fig. S7). Including active
RedE and RedM under these reaction conditions shows the
additional accumulation of a compound consistent with methyl-
3 ([M + H]
+ = 310.13397 m/z, 0.32 ppm). Mixtures without
active RedE do not accumulate this compound, though accu-
mulation of3 is increased (Fig. S7).
Single residue mutations in RedE
Based on the ternary cocrystal structures of RedE and
sequence alignments, nine single residue variants were
generated to investigate the potential role of each binding site
for catalytic activity in tandem reactions including StaP,
S. elongatusFDX, FDR and RedM (Fig. 5). RedM is included to
methylate the RedE product (2), as it has a short lifespan in

solution. In the primary site, the D168A variant targets the
position often found to be sensitive to mutation in many
IREDs andβHADs (31). The role of the residue at this position
is not fully understood, and mutation can eliminate or reduce
catalytic activity or alter stereoselectivity. The D168A variant
does not accumulate methyl-3 or reductasporine, suggesting a
critical role for this residue. Next, we sought to make mutants
that would perturb the hydrophobic lining of the primary site.
L239 presses directly on the maleimide ring of AFA forcing it
to pack closely to the nicotinamide ring of the cofactor, while
the more distant M175 packs with L172, Wʹ210, Fʹ217, and
Fʹ235 and together form half of the active site pocket. Assays of
the L239A variant result in reduced reductasporine formation,
whereas M175A has activity similar to the WT RedE. Lastly,
residue R242 hovers above the active site near the maleimide
ring of AFA and may participate in substrate recognition. It is
also a rare large residue toﬁnd in this position (Fig. 4B) and
may act to prevent a closeﬁt between domains. However, the
R242A variant has identical activity to WT RedE.
In the secondary site, H249 is positioned to hydrogen bond
with indolocarbazole substrates and may stabilize3 via its pyr-
rolic nitrogen or may interact with a carboxy group of a
carboxylated precursor (such as 4). The H249A variant has
markedly reduced reductasporine accumulation, and no
methyl-3 is observed. The A250L variant has normal reduc-
tasporine production; however, the production of methyl-3 is
eliminated. Observing these variants on short time scales in the
absence of RedM shows the pronounced accumulation of [M +
H]
+ ions attributable to 6,7-didehydro-K252c and 7-carboxy-
6,7-didehydro-K252c (Fig. S8). Together these indicate that the
secondary binding site plays a role in theﬂux of indolocarbazole
compounds through the biosynthetic pathway. Sequence anal-
ysis of IREDs found in the PDB and enzymes most similar to
RedE suggest there are several residues involved in domain-
domain contacts that are not preserved in RedE. For example,
IREDs will often have a glutamate or aspartate in place of L253 in
RedE and a histidine or asparagine in place of I246, which
interact with residues of the nearbyα6 helix and loop of the
Rossmann domain. However, replacing these residues in RedE,
as in variants L253E and I246H, results in no change from WT
activity. Lastly, R254 forms the back wall of the secondary
binding cleft and interacts with the unique PGGN loop. We
hypothesized that changes to this residue could destabilize the
loop and widen the secondary site, but RedE-R254A mutants
behave similarly to the WT enzyme.
Discussion
Structures of RedE bound with the substrate mimic AFA
unambiguously show two indolocarbazole binding sites. The
primary binding site positions the C5 atom immediately above
the nicotinamide ring of the NADPH cofactor for hydride
transfer, and the secondary binding site places the indolo-
carbazole in an adjoining cleft formed between the dimeriza-
tion domain and Rossmann domain. No secondary binding site
has been described among other IREDs and RedAms; however,
a Pseudomonas putida putative oxidoreductase with structure
coordinates deposited in the PDB (PDB: 3L6D, 24% identity)
features a similar cleft separating these domains. Given that
this unique structural feature is important to catalysis in RedE
as determined by mutations, we sought out structural and
sequence features distinguishing RedE from other IREDs and
RedAms which may be involved in the creation of this cleft.
With the increased publication of IRED structures over the
past ten years, it has become well-established that the Ross-
mann domain rotates relative to the dimerization domain into
distinct open and closed conformations with at least seven
IRED and RedAm enzymes captured in either state ( 42,
47– 52). These domain movements are often seen when
comparing apo structures to binary or ternary complexes.

NADPH, 1μM StaP, 5μM FDR, 20μM FDX, 20μM RedM and 20μM RedE
variant held at pH 8 with 20 mM Hepes.The removal of aspartate from
the primary active site via D168A eliminates any reductasporine (1) pro-
duction and shifts its metabolite proﬁle to look more like inactivated RedE.
L239A in the primary site and H249A in the secondary site both reduce
reductasporine accumulation and shifts the metabolite proﬁle to appear like
boiled RedE (bRedE). A250L does not greatly affect1 production, but no
longer accrues methyl-3 eluting at 13.8 min. Peaks marked with anasterisk
(*) are associated with StaP activity and have no UV-visual absorbance

Superposing open and closed conformation protomers onto
RedE shows that RedE resembles an exaggerated open
conformation, with all atom RMSD values on average 0.3 Å
lower for open conformations as to closed conformations.
RedE shows no conformational changes upon cofactor or
ligand binding, aside from the reorganization of the loop after
β2 upon NADP
+ binding positioning R33 to interact with the
adenine ring and 2 ʹ-phosphate of the cofactor. Given the
ternary complexes of RedE have little to no room for the
Rossmann domain to move toward the dimerization domain
due to the tightly packed AFA in each binding site, the
structure of RedE may represent a maximally closed confor-
mation despite resemblance to other IRED open conforma-
tions. The open to closed transition in these other IREDs hinge
at the N-terminal end of the interdomain helix (RedE:α8) just
below the contact point betweenα6 and αʹ10. A prominent
domain-domain bridging interaction is often found here as a
glutamate residue at position 250 or 253 (RedE numbering)
whose side chain associates with the N-terminal dipole
moment ofα6 while hydrogen bonding (8, 10, 47– 50, 53– 57),
or as a salt bridge between an arginine fromαʹ8 to an aspartate
or glutamate on helix α6( 51, 52). RedE does not preserve
either contact point, instead P194 and G195 from the“PGGN”
insertion loop connecting αʹ8t o αʹ9( Fig. 4) extends out to
residues P96, V97, and R100 ofα6, and D160, A162, M163,
and V166 of the N-terminal ofα8. This is the only interdomain
contact to α6 aside from Rʹ254 in αʹ10 via an iodide ion
associated with the helix’s N-terminal positive dipole moment.
Removing this interaction in the R254A variant leaves RedE
with WT activity levels and likely does not play a signiﬁcant
role in stabilizing the enzyme’s structure. The second series of
contacts between domains of IRED and RedAm enzymes occur
between αʹ9 and β6-8, which are largely hydrophobic. Many
enzymes have a series of large and medium sized residues
arranged at this interface, such as tryptophan, phenylalanine,
tyrosine, and histidine (8, 9, 47– 49, 51– 53, 55, 57). Other IRED
and RedAm enzymes which do not have large residues at these
sites do not have intimate interdomain contacts betweenαʹ9
and theβ-sheet of the Rossmann domain, and the majority of
domain-domain interactions occur atαʹ10 (10, 42, 50, 56, 58,
59). RedE has a series of small residues inαʹ9 (A202, V206, and
T213) which interlock with β-sheet residues (L131, L133,
M155, and L157), resulting in a tight interdomain interface.
The combination of loose interactions betweenαʹ10 and α6
alongside a tight interface betweenαʹ9 andβ6-8 results in the
Rossmann domain being pulled down towardαʹ9 and away
from αʹ10 relative to other IREDs, creating the exaggerated
open conformation and secondary indolocarbazole binding
cleft.
The IRED-like enzyme fromP. putidaKT2440 (PDB: 3L6D)
has a similar interdomain cleft between helicesαʹ10 and α6.
We ﬁnd a similar domain-domain contact pattern as RedE
with loose to no direct connections betweenαʹ10 andα6, and a
tight interface betweenαʹ9 and β6-8 with mainly small inter-
locking residues. Notably, the N-terminal of the interdomain
helix tucks W169 underneathα6, imparting a large rotation to
the Rossmann domain away from the interdomain helix
relative to RedE. Also,αʹ9 adopts a kink not seen in other IRED
structures between residues 214 to 218 allowing the relatively
large F217 to pack parallel to the Rossmann domain B-sheet
rather than push against it.
In IRED and RedAm enzymes an active site aspartate or
tyrosine is typically found to be essential for catalysis (31).
βHAD enzymes are found to use lysine residues at this posi-
tion in order to catalyze ketone reductions. RedE maintains
this active site aspartate (D168); however, it is solely used to
anchor the indolocarbazole substrate in the primary active site
via hydrogen bonding to the two indole N-H moieties. In-
spection of the active site reveals there are no candidates for a
catalytic base in RedE, with the only protic residue within a 5 Å
sphere of the AFA maleimide group being R242, an unlikely
proton donor. Furthermore, the R242A mutant has no impact
on enzymatic reaction products. Additionally, StaP is capable
of producing an unstable product consistent with3, the pro-
posed isoindole substrate for RedE. Isoindole readily tauto-
merizes in solution despite its 10π electron aromatic ring
system (60). The planar, aromatic 2H-isoindole tautomer
dominates in polar aprotic solvents, whereas the imine 1H-
isoindole tautomer dominates in nonpolar or protic solvents
(60, 61). Therefore, if the 26π electron system of3 acts anal-
ogously to isoindole, the imine form should dominate in the
primary active site either due to water exposed isoindole ni-
trogen or preequilibration to the imine form from solution or
secondary binding site. Without a dedicated catalytic base and
with the reactive imine form of the substrate potentially
favored in solution the subsequent reduction via NADPH
appears to be catalyzed in RedE by simple substrate orientation
and desolvation effects. When the close packing of the primary
site around the isoindole nitrogen is disturbed, as in L239A,
the overall production of products is greatly reduced. This may
be due to the increased mobility of the indolocarbazole and
consequent loss in precision alignment of the substrate for
efﬁcient hydride transfer.
The unexpected distal secondary indolocarbazole binding
site formed at the gap between the C-terminal helical dimer-
ization domain and N-terminal Rossmann domain implies a
mechanism for unstable substrate management. Compound3
is found to be unstable, mostly disappearing after 2 hin vitro
(Fig. S6). This is consistent with other isoindole compounds
that are known to oxidize readily when exposed to aerated
solutions (61) and form compounds analogous to known StaP
oxidation products ( 20). The secondary binding site may
sequester indolocarbazole substrate from solution, protecting
it from autooxidation and enabling subsequent reduction.
Disruption of the secondary site asserts that the site is essential
to efﬁcient catalysis with mutants H249A and A250L resulting
in losses in activity and accumulation of off-pathway indolo-
carbazole products. By the structure, A250L sterically excludes
indolocarbazoles from binding, whereas the effect of the
H249A mutation is less trivial to explain. H249 could play a
role in substrate recognition where it would hydrogen bond to
the isoindole nitrogen locking the substrate into place within
the secondary site. This hydrogen bond may act as a pseudo N-
substitution lessening the nucleophilic character at C5 and C7
Structure of reductasporine biosynthetic enzyme RedE

as seen in the more stable N-substituted isoindole molecules,
which tend to favor the planar, aromatic tautomer (60, 61).
Alternatively, H249 may play an active role in selecting for the
particular imine tautomer that lines up with the NADPH
cofactor for reduction (Fig. S9). This implies a direct transfer
of the imine substrate from the secondary site to the primary
site. Such a transfer could be guided by D168, as an indole
nitrogen is available for hydrogen bonding from the secondary
site to D168 if the side chain rotates and displaces the nearby
water molecule (Fig. 3B). With this hydrogen bond in place the
side chain can swing back down and guide the indolocarbazole
from the secondary site to the primary site. These ideas of
substrate protection and tautomer selection determining the
ﬂux of indolocarbazole products down a productive biosyn-
thetic route mirrors the proposed mechanisms distinguishing
RebC and StaC activity in the generation of the aglycone cores
of rebeccamycin and staurosporine, respectively (22, 23, 25).
RebC and the StaC-like RebC mutant, RebC-10x, were each
crystallized with 7-carboxy-K252c in their active sites, but in
alternate tautomeric forms (23, 25). RebC traps the enol form
requiring decarboxylation-oxidation in order to form AFA
(23), whereas RebC-10x traps the keto form, making the
carboxylate group available for decarboxylation directly to
K252c, the staurosporine aglycone (Fig. S1B)( 25). The sec-
ondary active site we report here for RedE represents a novel
approach to the similar issue of handling short-lived substrates
in indolocarbazole biosynthesis.
Over the past ten years IREDs and RedAms have drawn
increased attention over their potential application to the
synthesis of chiral amine products for use in drug
manufacturing (3– 6). RedAm substrate scopes have previously
been limited to combinations of small ketone/amine mole-
cules, with recent efforts directed at identifying and engi-
neering enzymes capable of accommodating larger molecules
(50, 51, 57, 62, 63). Tantalizingly, the RedE structure shows
that the combined indolocarbazole binding cleft is some 24 Å
wide providing ample space for engineering efforts toward
effecting arbitrary reductive aminations. Alternatively, RedE
may be used to identify the sequence determinants of an
extended binding cleft in order to create them in proven
RedAms for expanded substrate scope.
In summary, we report the structure of the reductasporine
biosynthetic IRED RedE cocrystallized with AFA revealing an
unprecedented extended active site cleft capable of binding
two indolocarbazole molecules. The structure of and site-
directed mutagenesis in the primary binding site suggests
reduction is catalyzed via precise substrate orientation and
desolvation effects, and the secondary binding site may serve
to capture and protect indolocarbazole substrates from spon-
taneous oxidation. This secondary site may even select for the
imine tautomer readily reduced in the primary site when
transferring directly from secondary to primary active site.
Approaching IREDs from their context in biosynthesis can
serve us unique insight into the familyvia unique structural
variations and natural substrate scope, and RedE provides a
promising new protein scaffold for reference in iterative
engineering.
Experimental procedures
General methods
Primers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies.
Q5 DNA polymerase, T4 DNA ligase, and restriction endo-
nucleases were purchased from New England Biolabs. DNA
sequencing was carried out by either Nucleic Acids Protein
Service Unit DNA Sequencing Facility or CMMT/BCCHR
DNA Sequencing Core Facility (University the British
Columbia). Nickel sepharose protein puriﬁcation resin and
HiLoad 26/60 Superdex 200pg size exclusion column was
purchased from GE HealthCare. Other general reagents were
purchased from Anatrace, Bio Basic Inc, Hampton Research,
Sigma-Aldrich, Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, and VWR Interna-
tional as necessary. Liquid chromatography was carried out on
either an Agilent 1260 Inﬁnity or Inﬁnity II HPLC system with
diode array. Low-resolution mass spectrometry data were
recorded on an Agilent 6120 Quadruple LC/MS, and high-
resolution LC-MS data was recorded on an Agilent 6546
LC/quadrupole time-of-ﬂight machine. Indolocarbazoles were
separated on C18 columns sourced from Phenomenex and
Agilent (250 × 4.6 mm, 5μm particle size).
Cloning, expression, and puriﬁcation of redE and redM
Genes redE and redM, codon optimized for expression in
E. coli, were cloned into pET28a at the NdeI and XhoI re-
striction sites with a stop codon was included before the XhoI
cut site, leaving an N-terminal 6xHis tag in the gene product.
Plasmids pET28a-redE or pET28a-redM were transformed
into calcium-competent E. coli BL21(DE3) by heat-shock and
grown in lysogen broth (LB; 10 g/L NaCl, 10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/
L yeast extract) (37
/C14C, 180 rpm) with kanamycin (50μg/ml) to
an A600 of 0.6 before cooling to 16/C14C. Expression was induced
by addition of IPTG (to 100μM) and incubated at 16/C14C for a
further 18 h. Cells were pelleted by centrifugation (4 /C14C,
10 min, 3000g), and resuspended in 50 mM Tris (pH 8),
500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole supplemented with either
1.5 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) or 5 mM 5 mM
β-mercaptoethanol (BME) reducing agent. Cell suspensions
were lysed by sonication (25% amplitude, 4 s on/8 s off cycles,
6 min), and cell debris removedvia centrifugation (45 min,
15,000g). The supernatant was loaded onto Ni-IDA afﬁnity
resin and eluted with a 20 to 500 mM imidazole step gradient
in 50 mM Tris (pH 8), 500 mM NaCl, and either 1.5 mM
TCEP or 5 mM BME. Elution fractions with recombinant
protein were passed through a 0.22μm syringe ﬁlter and pu-
riﬁed via size-exclusion chromatography (20 mM Tris (pH 8),
50 mM NaCl with corresponding reducing agent. SDS-PAGE
was used to track the purity of resulting fractions for further
use in crystallography screens.
Selenomethionine incorporation into RedE
E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with pET28a- redE were
grown in LB medium with kanamycin (50μg/ml) overnight.
From this culture, a 30μl aliquot was inoculated into 30 ml of
antibiotic supplemented M9 medium for growth overnight.

J. Biol. Chem. (2024) 300(2) 105642 9
Starter cultures (10 ml) were each added to 1 L of M9 medium
with kanamycin and grown at 37/C14C (180 rpm) for 4 h to an
A600 of 0.7 before cooling to 16 /C14C over 30 min. Lysine,
threonine, and phenylalanine (100 mg each) followed by
leucine, isoleucine, valine, and selenomethionine (50 mg each)
were added to 1 L of medium (64). Cultures were then induced
with 100 μM IPTG and grown for 18 h. Selenomethionine-
substituted RedE was puriﬁed as described previously with
buffers supplemented with 5 mM BME.
RedE crystallization
Puriﬁed protein was screened on a variety of commer-
cially available screens (Hampton, Index, Top96, MCSG) in
a 96-well sitting drop format with 2 μl drops (1:1 ratio of
protein to precipitant solution). Preliminary hits were opti-
mized in a hanging-drop format with drops mixed in a 1:1
ratio of well to protein solution. Diffraction quality RedE
crystals were grown over wells containing 0.33 M NaI,
0.1 M Tris pH 8.5, 21 to 23% PEG 3350 and 1.5 mM TCEP
or 5 mM BME using up to 42 mg ml
−1 of protein. Under
these conditions RedE cocrystallized with NADP+ (100 mM
in water) and/or AFA (100 mM in dimethyl sulfoxide) when
10 mM and 1.2 mM of each, respectively, were included in
the protein solution. Crystals of apo-RedE grew at 0.35 M
NaI, 0.1 M bicine pH 9, 25% PEG 3350 and 5 mM BME.
Selenomethionine-substituted RedE crystals were prepared
similarly with mother liquor at 0.3 M NaI, 0.1 M Tris pH 8,
25% PEG 3350 and 10 mg ml
−1 protein. All crystals were
soaked for 1 to 10 min in mother liquor prepared to 10 to
15% ethylene glycol before ﬂash-freezing in liquid nitrogen.
Crystals were tested for diffraction using a Rigaku
MicroMax-007HF (1.54 A, rotating copper anode) with
Saturn 944+ charge-coupled device detector, and those dif-
fracting to at least 3 Å were retained for data collection at a
synchrotron.
Data collection, structure determination, and reﬁnement
Datasets for the selenomethionine-substituted RedE were
collected on beamline 08ID-1 at the Canadian Light Source
using MX300-HE and Pilatus 6 M detectors. Datasets for RedE
cocrystals were collected on beamline BL9-2 at the Stanford
Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource. Data sets were integrated
using iMOSFLM ( https://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/mosﬂm/
mosﬂm/)( 65) or XDS ( https://xds.mr.mpg.de/)( 66) and
merged in AIMLESS (67). Selenomethionine structures were
phased via single anomalous dispersion of selenium and iodine
atoms via the Autosol tool in the Phenix (68) software package
(https://phenix-online.org/). The single-wavelength anoma-
lous diffraction phasing results were then input into Autobuild
(69) for initial model building followed by several rounds of
manual inspection and building in COOT (https://www2.mrc-
lmb.cam.ac.uk/personal/pemsley/coot/)( 70) and re ﬁnement
via phenix.reﬁne (71). Native protein datasets were processed
similarly with phases solved for via molecular replacement
using the SeMet-RedE model through PHASER-MR (https://
www.phaser.cimr.cam.ac.uk/)( 72). Ligand restraints for AFA
were generated using eLBOW (73).
Site-directed mutagenesis of RedE
Primers were designed so that the overlap region con-
taining the mutation had a T
m /C2455 /C14C and the nonover-
lapping region had a T m about 7 /C14C higher (calculated
against the complementary DNA strand) ( 74). Where
possible mutations were included that removed or added
restriction sites for preliminary screening via digests. Stan-
dard PCR was carried out using an annealing step set to the
higher T
m and ended with a 10 min elongation step. The
PCR product mixture was incubated with DpnI before
transforming the digest solution as described previously into
E. coli DH5α. Puriﬁed plasmids were screened for restriction
fragment polymorphism and mutations con ﬁrmed by
sequencing.
Cloning and expression of rebO and rebD, and production of
CPA
Genes rebO and rebD were ampliﬁed from genomic DNA
(Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes DSM 44217), and ligated into
pET28a and pET22b, respectively. These plasmids were
transformed into chemically competent E. coli BL21 (DE3)
cells and used to prepare CPA according to the previously
published procedure (17).
Expression and puriﬁcation of StaP, FDX, and FDR
Plasmid pET28a-staP was kindly provided by Catherine
Drennan (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), and plas-
mids pET28a-fdr and pET28a-fdx coding for S. elongatus
PCC 7942 ferredoxin-NADP oxidoreductase (FDR) and FDX
I, respectively, were received from Dr Hai-Yan He (Institute
of Medicinal Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Medical
Sciences).
E. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with pET28a-staP, pET28a-
fdr or pET28a-fdx were grown in LB medium with kanamycin
(50 μg/ml) to an A
600 of 0.5 before cooling to 16 /C14C over
30 min. Each culture was then supplemented with 100μM
IPTG and cells with plasmids coding for heme proteins (StaP
and FDX) were further supplemented with 1 mMδ-amino-
levulinic acid before incubating for 18 h.
Media were removed by centrifugation (4
/C14C, 10 min,
3000g), and cells resuspended in 50 mM Tris (pH 8), 500 mM
NaCl, and 5 mM imidazole. The bacterial suspension was lysed
via sonication (25% amplitude, cycles of 4 s on and 8 s off for
6 min), and cell debris cleared via centrifugation (45 min,
15,000g). Supernatant was passed through a Ni-afﬁnity column
and enzyme harvested over an imidazole step gradient
(5– 300 mM). Fractions containing recombinant enzyme were
dialyzed to remove excess imidazole and salt before screening
for activity against CPA followed by adding glycerol to 10%
(v/v) and storing at−70
/C14C.

Analysis of RedE variants
A typical reaction includes 500 μM CPA incubated with
1 μM StaP, 20 μM RedM, and 20 μM RedE variant in the
presence of 1 mM NADPH, 5μM FDR and 20μM FDX co-
factors held at pH 8 with 20 mM Hepes. Reactions are
quenched with the addition of an equal volume of acetonitrile
(ACN) and analyzed on a reverse phase C18 HPLC column
(1 ml min
−1, 98% H2O to 98% ACN gradient over 30 min, each
solvent supplemented with 0.1% formic acid). Elution was
monitored using a diode array from 220 to 500 nm or by mass.
Time-course analysis of StaP reaction products
StaP reactions include 500μM CPA, 1 mM NADPH, 1μM
StaP, 5 μM FDR, and 20μM FDX held at pH 8 with 20 mM
Hepes at room temperature. Reactions were quenched with
equal volumes of ACN and analyzed on a reverse phase C18
HPLC column (1 ml min
−1, 98% H2O to 98% ACN gradient
over 18 min, each solvent supplemented with 0.1% formic
acid). Elution was monitored at 280 nm and by mass.
Visualization and analysis software
Pymol was used for secondary structure matching and
creating protein visualizations (75). Surface areas and dimer
interaction surfaces were calculated via PISA (33). Protein
sequence alignments were generated using Clustal Omega (34)
or COBALT (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/cobalt/)( 76)
and visualized with Jalview (https://www.jalview.org/)( 77).
Data availability
Crystal structure model coordinates and diffraction data for
apo-RedE, RedE bound with NADP+, and complexes of RedE
with NADP+ and arcyriaﬂavin A in either primary or sec-
ondary site can be found at the Protein Data Bank under
accession codes 8U04, 8U05, 8U06, and 8U07, respectively.
