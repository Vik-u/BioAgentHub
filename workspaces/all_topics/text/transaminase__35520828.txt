Furfurylamine and furfuryl alcohol are known as important furfural-upgrading derivatives in the production
of pharmaceuticals, ﬁbers, additives, polymers, etc. In a one-pot manner, the catalysis of biomass into
furan-based chemicals was established in a tandem reaction with sulfonated Sn–graphite catalysts and
biocatalysts. Using a raw bamboo shoot shell (75.0 g L/C0 1) as the feedstock, a high furfural yield of 41.1%
(based on xylan) was obtained using the heterogeneous Sn–graphite catalyst (3.6 wt% dosage) in water
(pH 1.0) for 30 min at 180/C14 C. Under the optimum bioreaction conditions, the biomass-derived furfural
could be transformed into furfuryl alcohol (0.310 g furfuryl alcohol per g xylan in biomass) by
a reductase biocatalyst or furfurylamine (0.305 g furfurylamine per g xylan in biomass) using an u-
transaminase biocatalyst. Such one-pot chemoenzymatic processes combined the merits of both
heterogeneous catalysts and biocatalysts, and sustainable processes were successfully constructed for
synthesizing key bio-based furans.
1. Introduction
The global trend is aimed at developing numerous environ-
mentally friendly technologies for utilizing sustainable and
abundant lignocellulosic biomass to manufacture numerous
functional materials, biofuels, and chemicals as substitutes to
the current petroleum-based economy.
1–4 A bamboo shoot shell
(BSS) is mainly composed of carbohydrate (hemicellulose plus
cellulose) and lignin. It is an abundant renewable bioresource
of energy, food, feed and chemicals, which has an annual
output of about 20 million tons in China.
5 However, most of
BSSs are burned or directly discarded and are not yet eﬀectively
utilized, which cause waste of resources and environmental
pollution.
Furfural (FF) is known as one of the top twelve value-added
platform bio-chemicals that can be synthesized from renew-
able biomass.
3 It has been widely utilized in the industrial
production of additives, solvents, biofuels, plastics, resins, and
polymers.
6–9 FF is also used as a building block for the synthesis
of high-value-added furan-based chemicals such as furfuryl
alcohol (FFA) and furfurylamine (FAM). FFA is an important FF
derivative,10,11 which can be utilized in manufacturing adhe-
sives, vitamin C, plastics, dispersing agents, lubricants, poly-
mers, resins and biofuels. Cu/MgO gave 98% yield of FFA at
180
/C14 C under high-pressured H2.12 A nickel–tin-based catalyst
converted FF to FFA (99% selectivity) at 100/C14 C in the presence of
high-pressured H2 (2.0 MPa) in a biphasic system.13 UiO-66
converted FF to FFA (71% yield) for 10 h at 170/C14 C.14 Another
FF-upgrading product FAM is a useful compound in the
production of drugs, additives,bers and pesticides, which can
be prepared by the amination of FF and the reduction of CN- or
NO
3-based compounds over chemical catalysts.15–17 Ru/HZSM-5
catalyzed FF into FAM at 76% yield at 100 /C14 C under high-
pressurized H2 (3.0 MPa).18
Recently, it has gained an increase in interest to synthesize
furan-based chemicals via biocatalysis approaches. To e ﬃ-
ciently catalyze BSS into furans (FFA and FAM), a tandem
catalysis of BSS was established via the chemoenzymatic
approach using a heterogeneous catalyst and biocatalyst
(reductase or u-transaminase) (Fig. 1). Heterogeneous Sn –
graphite wasrst prepared and further characterizedvia SEM,
XRD, FTIR and BET, and then, the eﬀects of catalytic system's
pH, catalytic temperature, catalytic time and catalyst Sn –
graphite dosage on the FF production were investigated.
Moreover, biotransformation conditions for converting FF to
high-value-added furan (FFA or FAM) by recombinant reductase
or u-transaminase were optimized. Finally, one-pot catalytic
processes for catalyzing BSS into furan-based chemicals (FAM
and FOL) were established in the tandem catalytic reaction with
sulfonated Sn–graphite catalysts and biocatalysts.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
A bamboo shoot shell (BSS) was collected from a village
(Changzhou, China). Graphite was purchased from Jinglong
Graphite Factory (Beijing, China). SnCl4$5H2O, ammonia, iso-
propylamine (IPA), furfural (FF) and other chemicals were
purchased from Changzhou Runyou Reagent Co., Ltd. (Jiangsu,
China) and other commercial sources.
2.2. Synthesis of the Sn–graphite catalyst
50.0 g of raw graphite was immersed in 150 mL of 4.0 M H
2SO4
at 60 /C14 C for 3.5 h. Subsequently, the pH of this mixture was
regulated to neutrality, and the acid-treated graphite was iso-
lated by ltration and washed by deionized water to remove
residues. 19.4 g of SnCl
4$5H2O, 42.0 g of acid-treated graphite,
and 700 g of ethanol were added to a 2 L container and thor-
oughly blended by stirring. Aqueous ammonia NH
3$H2O
(25.0 wt%) was slowly dropped into the emulsion, and its pH
was regulated to reach 6.0. This pH-adjusted solution was dried
in a 70
/C14 C oven for 12 h and further oven-dried for another 12 h
at 90/C14 C. 150 mL of 0.50 M H2SO4 immersed dried solid powder
for 3 h, and then, this sulfonated solid was isolated byltration
and washed by deionized water to neutrality. Wet solid was
dried in a 110
/C14 C oven for 3 h and further dried in a 500/C14 C
muﬄe furnace for another 3 h. Sn–graphite was obtained for
further use.
2.3. Sn –graphite-mediated catalysis of BSS to FF
Dry-milled BSS (3.75 g, 40–60 mesh), Sn–graphite (0–6.0 wt%
dosage) and 50 mL water were blended in a 100 mL high-
temperature and high-pressure (HTHP) stainless-steel reactor
(Zhengjiang Jingkou Dantu Huanqiu Electrical Instrument, P.
R. China). Aer BSS were catalyzed for 5–60 min at a certain
temperature (160–180
/C14 C) and pH (0.6–1.2) under 500 rpm
agitation, this reactor was placed in an iced water-bath. The
formed FF was measured by HPLC. FF yield from xylan in BSS
was calculated using the following equation:

2.4. Biosynthesis of FFA and FAM from FF
The bioreduction of FF was conducted by recombinantE. coli
CCZU-A13 expressing an NADH-dependent reductase. 19 The
bioamination of FF was carried out by recombinant E. coli
AT2018 cells harboring u-transaminase.2 In a 100 mL Luria–
Bertani (LB) broth containing 50.0 mgm L/C0 1 kanamycin, the
cells were grown to optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 0.60 at
37 /C14 C and induced with the addition of IPTG (50.0mmol). Aer
incubation at 37/C14 C for another 5 h, the cells were harvested in
a centrifuge at 4/C14 C and 9000/C2 g for 6 min, and then washed
with 0.85 wt% normal saline three times.
In this study, the catalytic conversions of FF were pH and
temperature that aﬀecting FF biotransformation were opti-
mized using commercial FF (60.0 mM) as the substrate. FF-
reducing reactions were carried out in various pH values of
buﬀers (100 mM, pH 6.5–8.0) with CCZU-A13 cells (50.0 g L
/C0 1)i n
the presence of cosubstrate glucose (0.5 –3.0 mol glucose
per mol FF) at 20–45 /C14 C. Bioamination reactions were con-
ducted in various pH values of buﬀers (100 mM, pH 6.5–9.0)
with AT2018 cells (50.0 g L/C0 1) in the presence of amine donor
isopropylamine (IPA) (0.50–5.0 mol IPA per mol FF) at 25–50 /C14 C.
FF, FFA and FAM were assayedvia HPLC.
Dry-milled BSS (3.75 g, 40–60 mesh), Sn–graphite (3.6 wt%)
and 50 mL water were blended in a 100 mL HTHP reactor. Aer
BSS were catalyzed in this media (pH 1.0) for 30 min at 180/C14 C
and 500 rpm, the pH of the FF liquor was regulated to suitable
pH for biotransformation. The bioreduction of FF into FFA with
E. coliCCZU-A13 wet cells (50.0 g L/C0 1) was conducted at pH 6.5
and 30/C14 C in the presence of cosubstrate glucose (1 mol glucose
per mol FF). The bioamination of FF into FAM withE. coli

2.5. Analytical methods
Graphite or Sn–graphite was observed via Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy using Nicolet PROT ´EG´E FT-IR (JSM-
6360LA, JEOL, Japan), X-ray di ﬀraction (XRD) on a Rigaku
XRD-6000 di ﬀractometer (Rigaku Corporation, Japan) with
a CuKa radiation and JCPDS reference number (no. 85-0712),
and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (JSM-6360LA, JEOL,
Japan). In an ASAP2020M system (Micromeritics Instrument
Co., USA), nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms at 77 K
were used to measure the Brunauer –Emmett–Teller (BET)-
specic surface area. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy
(XPS) analysis was performed on a physical electronics ESCA-
LAB 250 spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientic Co. Ltd, USA).
FF, FFA, and FAM were quantied via HPLC.
20,21 FF (furfural),
FAM (furfurylamine), and FFA (furfuryl alcohol) were deter-
mined by HPLC equipped with a Waters Nova-Pak C18 column
(3.9 /C2 150 mm, 4mM), which were eluted by mobile phase (20
v% methanol and 80 v% water containing 0.1 wt% triuoro-
acetic acid) at aow rate of 0.8 mL min
/C0 1. FFA and FAM were
detected at 210 nm, and FF was detected at 254 nm. The
components of BSS were determined as reported NREL
(National Renewable Energy Laboratory) method (http://
www.nrel.gov/biomass/analytical_procedures.html).
3. Results and discussion
3.1. Characterization of solid acid Sn–graphite
Graphite, one highly promising carrier, has currently been used
for the preparation of functional materials, adsorbents, cata-
lysts, etc.
22–25 In this case, tin-loaded sulfonated acid-treated
graphite (Sn–graphite) was used to convert BSS into FF. The
surface changes of Sn –graphite were observed by nitrogen
adsorption–desorption isotherms, XRD, SEM and FT-IR.
Nitrogen adsorption–desorption isotherms were used to
examine the changes of the Sn–graphite surface area, and the
results are given in Table 1. Sn–graphite had a smaller pore size
(5.1 nm), larger BET specic surface area (30.4 m2 g/C0 1) and
bigger pore volume (0.04 cm 3 g/C0 1) compared to graphite.
Probably, solvent treatment, sulfonation and oven-dry perfor-
mance could change the pore and surface of graphite. SEM
revealed that graphite and Sn–graphite had diverse distribu-
tions of particle size (Fig. 2). Chemical groups of graphite and
Sn–graphite were observed via FT-IR (Fig. 3). The peaks at

1401 cm/C0 1 (C–C stretching vibration), and 1021 cm/C0 1 (stretch-
ing vibration of sulfur–oxygen double bonds of SO4
2/C0 )27 were
observed. The FT-IR measurement was performed to under-
stand the structure of Sn–graphite. This catalyst was sulfonated
graphite. XRD was used to detect the crystal structures of solid
samples (Fig. 4). Signicant diﬀraction peaks at 2q values of
26.4
/C14 , 44.5/C14 , and 54.6 /C14 are observed in graphite and Sn –
graphite. 2q ¼ 26.4/C14 corresponds to the diﬀraction peak of
graphite, which is also the characteristic peak of graphite. The
peak intensities of Sn–graphite are lower than those of graphite.
The Sn–graphite preparation process could inuence the main
structure of graphite. XPS was used for assaying Sn–graphite
(Fig. S1, in ESI†). It was found that Sn had three valences (0, +2,
and +4). The fractions of Sn
0 3d5/2,S n0 3d5/2, and Sn0 3d5/2 were
5.2%, 32.3%, and 63.5%, respectively. Graphite and tin exhibit
very good biocompatibility and do not arise any serious toxicity.
Using graphite, a heterogeneous tin-based graphite catalyst has
the advantage over homogeneous catalysts due the potential
biocompatible, easy to separate and high thermo-stability.
3.2. Optimization of catalyzing BSS into FF with Sn–graphite
Lignocellulosic biomass is a sustainable feedstock for
manufacturing FF,
28,29 which involves the hydrolysis of xylan in
biomass to D-xylose, followed by the dehydration of biomass-
derived D-xylose to FF.9 On an industrial scale, homogeneous
mineral acids are widely used for converting D-xylose to FF;
however, it encounters equipment corrosion, waste disposal
and high operational cost.
30–32 To address these issues,
numerous heterogeneous solid acids (Amberlyst 70, SBA-15-
HSO
3, sulfonated attapulgite, functional resin, modied zeolite,
etc.) exhibit superior catalytic characteristics for convertingD-
xylose into FF under environmentally friendly conditions.33–38
To eﬀectively catalyze biomass into FF, it was necessary to
obtain the optimal solid acid-mediated conversion conditions.
In this study, four catalytic reaction parameters including the
catalytic system's acidity, catalytic temperature, catalytic time
and catalyst Sn –graphite dosage were investigated for FF
production.
It is known that the degree of acidity in the catalytic reaction
system may facilitate the FF formation.

system's pH (acidity) were tested on the FF yields within 30 min
at 180/C14 C (Fig. 5). When the pH values were raised from 0.6 to
1.0, FF yields (based on xylan in BSS) increased from 29.9% to
41.1%. By raising the pH value from 1.0 to 1.2, FF yields
decreased clearly. Too low pH of the catalytic system might
result in FF degradation. Aer BSS samples were catalyzed
with Sn –graphite in the HTHP reactor, the pH values of
reaction media increased. Probably, the hydrolysis of xylan in
BSS to pentose (mainly
D-xylose) was required to consume H+,
and the dehydration of the formed D-xylose to FF produced
H2O. Therefore, the pH of the catalytic system was chosen as
1.0 for assisting the Sn–graphite-mediated conversion of BSS
into FF.
In a catalytic reaction system, catalyst loading, catalytic
temperature and catalytic time can inuence the FF forma-
tion.39–41 The catalytic process of BSS into FF was established in
water (pH 1.0) containing Sn–graphite (0–6.0 wt% dose) at 160–
180 /C14 C for 5–60 min. It was found that Sn–graphite dosages had
signicance on the FF production (Fig. 6a). The yield of FF
increased with the rise in the Sn–graphite dosage from 0 to
3.6 wt%, and the maximum (41.1% yield) at the dosage of
3.6 wt%. Further increasing the Sn–graphite dosage from 3.6 to
6.0 wt%, the FF yield dropped slowly. The eﬀects of the catalytic
temperature and time on the FF yields are illustrated in Fig. 6b.
A high FF yield was achieved when BSS was converted for 30 min
at 180
/C14 C. Therefore, dry-milled BSS (75.0 g L/C0 1) was catalyzed
with Sn–graphite (3.6 wt% dosage) in 50 mL water (pH 1.0)
within 30 min at 180/C14 C. The obtained FF liquor was composed
of 58.3 mM glucose, 50.0 mM xylose, 66.0 mM FF, 1.8 mM HMF,
and 10.3 mM levulinic acid.
The results of the recycling test are shown in Fig. S2 (in ESI).†
The FF yields decreased gradually aer each recycle for 30 min at
180
/C14 C. From 1st to 5th run, the yield of FF decreased from 41.1%
to 36.1% in the sealed reactor, indicating a comparable stable
recycle capacity. Sn–graphite had good stability to be reused for
catalyzing BSS into FF. To further evaluate the stability of Sn–
graphite, the determination of the Sn content was carried out
before and aer the repeated use of Sn–graphite (Table S1, in
ESI†). The Sn content on Sn–graphite decreased slightly from
8.1% to 7.7% aer the 1
st recycle. However, the content of Sn ions
on Sn–graphite dropped signicantly to 2.9% aer the 5th recycle.
The loss of Sn on Sn–graphite resulted in a decrease in the FF
yield aer the recovery and reuse of Sn–graphite.
3.3. Biotransformation of FF into FFA and FAM
To eﬃciently synthesize FFA or FAM, the optimization of bio-
logically transforming FF was conducted using 60.0 mM
commercial FF as the substrate. Using CCZU-A13 cells as
reductase biocatalysts, the optimum cosubstrate glucose, cata-
lytic temperature and catalytic pH for catalyzing the bio-
reduction of FF were 1.0 mol glucose per mol FF, 30
/C14 C and 6.5,
respectively (Fig. S3 and S4, in ESI†). Using AT2018 cells as
amination biocatalysts, the optimum amine donor IPA dose, the
biocatalytic temperature and biocatalytic pH for the bio-
amination of FF were 3.0 mol IPA per mol FF, 35
/C14 C and 7.5,
respectively (Fig. S5 and S6, in ESI†).
In the HTHP reactor (500 rpm), dry-milled BSS (3.75 g), Sn–
graphite (3.6 wt% dosage) and 50 mL water were blended and
incubated for 30 min at 180/C14 C and pH 1.0. Subsequently, the
pH of BSS-slurry containing 66.0 mM FF was regulated with 3 M
NaOH. The bioreduction of BSS-derived FF was initiated by
adding CCZU-A13 wet cells (50.0 g L
/C0 1), which was conducted at
pH 6.5 and 30 /C14 C by the supplementary of glucose (1.0 mol
glucose per mol FF). Without the removal of Sn–graphite, BSS-
derived FF was completely catalyzed into FFA by CCZU-A13
whole cells within 2 h (Fig. 7a).M. guilliermondii catalyzed the
bioreduction of 50.0 mM FF to FFA in the yield of 83%.42 B.
coagulans converted /C24 200.0 mM FF to FFA at 86% yield in
a dioctyl phthalate –water biphasic system. 21 Signicantly,
CCZU-A13 whole-cells harbor high reductase activity towards FF
in aqueous media. u-Transaminase can synthesize organic
amines via biotransamination. Aldehyde or ketone (amine
acceptor) can accept the amino group (–NH
2) from an amine
donor in the presence of coenzyme pyridoxal-5 0-phosphate
(PLP).42–45 The bioamination of FF by AT2018 wet cells (50.0 g
L/C0 1) was performed at pH 7.5 and 35/C14 C by the supplementary of
amine donor IPA (3.0 mol IPA per mol FF). In the presence of
Sn–graphite, BSS-derived FF was wholly catalyzed into FAM by
AT2018 whole cells within 1.5 h (Fig. 7b). The yield of FAM
reached 83% from 20.0 mM FF withC. violaceumwithin 24 h.

90.3 mM FF was biologically aminated into FAM at 74% yield by
the u-transaminase biocatalyst using a high dose of amine
donor D-alanine (1.44 M).20 Excessive D-alanine was used for FF
bioamination, and a large amount of unwanted byproduct
pyruvate might produce, which was not easy to be isolated from
the bioamination system. IPA was used as an amine donor;
however, acetone was formed as a co-product a er bio-
amination, which could be easily separated under a low pres-
sure or slight heating. Clearly, a relatively low dose of the amine
donor IPA was used, and high bioamination eﬃciency was
achieved in this study.
To sum up, the whole cells of CCZU-A13 and AT2018 could
be used to eﬃciently catalyze FF into furan chemicals under the
mild performance conditions. Using the BSS-derived FF liquor
as the feedstock, no inhibition was found when bioreduction
with CCZU-A13 whole cells and bioamination with AT2018
whole cells. The combination of the heterogeneous Sn–graphite
catalysis and biocatalysis in a cascade fashion without the
isolation of intermediates and Sn –graphite catalysts could
shorten the operating time, operation cost, and waste genera-
tion. Sustainable bioconversion of BSS-derived FF into high-
value-added bio-furan chemicals was successfully veried in
this study.
3.4. Mass balance from BSS to FFA and FAM
Mass balance was calculated using data from the BSS compo-
nents, Sn–graphite-mediated catalysis of BSS to FF and whole-
cell biocatalysis of FF (Fig. 8). The dry solid BSS (75.0 g) was
composed of 28.9 g glucan, 10.6 g arabinan, and 21.2 g xylan. In
a 5 L reactor containing 1 L deionized water, 75.0 g BSS, and
36.0 g Sn–graphite, the Sn–graphite-mediated catalysis of BSS
was carried out for 30 min 500 rpm and 180
/C14 C, and the ob-
tained 1.0 L FF liquor was composed of 10.5 g glucose (58.3
mM), 7.5 g xylose (50.0 mM), 6.3 g FF (66.0 mM), 0.23 g HMF (1.8
mM) and 1.2 g levulinic acid (10.3 mM). BSS-derived FF (6.3 g)
was bioconverted into 6.1 g FFA with the CCZU-A13 wet cells
(50.0 g) within 2 h in the presence of 11.9 g glucose at 30
/C14 C and
pH 6.5. The yield was obtained at 0.142 g FFA per g BSS (0.310 g
FFA per g xylan in BSS). Moreover, the 1.0 L BSS-derived FF
liquor containing 6.3 g FF was biotransformed into 6.0 g FAM
with the AT2018 wet cells (50.0 g) within 1.5 h by supplementary
of 11.7 g IPA at 35
/C14 C and pH 7.5. The yield was obtained at
0.140 g FAM per g BSS (0.305 g FAM per g xylan in BSS).
Lignocellulosic materials are regarded as sustainable feed-
stocks for manufacturing biobased chemicals. 46–50 Recently,
these materials have gained a considerable interest to synthe-
size organonitrogen and hydroxy compounds from biomass
feedstocks.
51–55 Organonitrogen chemical FAM and hydroxy
compound FFA, two kinds of important furan molecules,51–53
could be manufactured from the abundant, renewable and
inexpensive BSS. First, BSS was eﬀectively catalyzed to FF with
Sn–graphite (3.6 wt% dosage) within 30 min at 180/C14 C. Subse-
quently, the bioreduction and bioamination of BSS-derived FF
were conducted under mild reaction conditions. In a one-pot
manner, the established chemoenzymatic approaches could
be used for tandemly converting BSS into furan-based chem-
icals (furfuryl alcohol and furfurylamine) via a sequential
catalysis with heterogeneous Sn–graphite catalysts and bio-
catalysts. This strategy might provide an economic way for high-
value utilization lignocellulosic biomass, and a techno-
economic analysis of the chemoenzymatic conversion of
biomass into furan-based chemicals will be carried out in future
research.
4. Conclusion
Using BSS as a feedstock, a high FF yield of 41.1% (based on the
xylan in BSS) was obtained using the heterogeneous Sn –
graphite catalyst (3.6 wt% dosage) in water (pH 1.0) at 180
/C14 C for
30 min. BSS (75 g L/C0 1) could eﬀectively convert xylan in BSS into
66.0 mM FF. Using glucose as a co-substrate, this BSS-derived
FF could be catalyzed into FFA in the yield of 0.310 g FFA
per g xylan in BSS by CCZU-A13 whole cells within 2 h at pH 6.5
and 30
