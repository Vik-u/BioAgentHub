This work reports cascade reactions using a pyranose 2-oxidase and transaminases for synthesizing the rare
amino sugars mannosamine, glucosamine, and galactosamine. Transaminases were engineered to accept
unnatural 2-keto-sugars, providing up to 68% galactosamine yield. The mechanisms of C2-amination by
these transaminases were also investigated. These transaminase variants have potential applications in
high-value amino sugar synthesis.
1 Introduction
C2 chiral amino sugars are important synthons in variouselds.
For instance, glucosamine is used as a commercial supplement
for treating bone and joint disorders.
1 Amino sugars can also be
used as building blocks for synthesizing medically relevant
carbohydrate materials.
2–4 Galactosamine, allosamine and
glucosamine are also useful for the synthesis of chiral ligands
valuable for many asymmetric catalytic reactions.
5,6 The use of
classical organic synthesis approaches to synthesize amino
sugars is cumbersome due to the inherent stereochemistry of
carbohydrates and the need for protecting group chemistry.7 In
addition, chemical methods for synthesizing glucosamine,
galactosamine and mannosamine involve protecting and
deprotecting anomeric and other groups in sugars.
8,9 Some of
the methods involve up to four steps including C2 protection by
an azide, and require a rare sugar and thiomannoside as
starting materials. The process involves displacing triates at
the C2 position with azide, yielding glucosamine building
blocks in 70% yields aer two days.
10 Although the biosynthesis
of amino sugars can be carried out in microorganisms, it
requires the use of expensive starting materials such as sugar
phosphates or sugar nucleotides.
11 Therefore, a new, alternative
method is needed to establish environmentally friendly indus-
trial processes that can produce amino sugars without compli-
cated protection and deprotection steps and using inexpensive
starting precursors.
Asymmetric synthesis using transaminases (TA) is attractive
as a biocatalytic tool for chiral amine synthesis
12,13 as these
pyridoxal-50 -phosphate-(PLP) dependent enzymes catalyze
stereoselective amino group transfer using widely available
amino donors such as alanine or isopropylamine. Two trans-
aminases fromMycobacterium vanbaaleniiTA (Mv-TA) and from
Rhodobacter sphaeroides TA (Rh-TA) can accept a variety of
sugars derived from biomass to produce aminopolyols, which
are ingredients in cosmetic applications.
14 The direct amination
of aldoses at C1 of various monosaccharides catalyzed by the
transaminase ATA256-TA could create valuable chiralu-amino
alcohols.15 A two-step cascade reaction of galactose oxidase with
Cvi-TA was used to add an amino group at C6 of galactose to
generate a novel amino sugar.16 Currently, there are no reports
of eﬀective biocatalytic processes for C2 amino sugar produc-
tion because this wouldrst require highly specic oxidation at
the C2 hydroxy group position of a monosaccharide.
The pyranose 2-oxidase (P2O) from Trametes multicolor is
a avoenzyme which can catalyze the regio-specic oxidation of
common sugars at the C2-position to generate 2-keto sugars.17
Its reaction mechanism and applications have been extensively
investigated.
18–24 Sugar oxidation by P2O is a green process
because the by-product of the reaction (H2O2) can be easily
removed by adding catalase to generate oxygen and water.
Therefore, we proposed to use an engineered P2O in combina-
tion with a TA to produce chiral amino sugars in this enzymatic
cascade (Fig. 1).
Herein, we report a cascade reaction utilizing a P2O and TAs
to synthesize the valuable C2 chiral amino sugars

sugars, D-glucose andD-galactose. As these 2-keto-sugars are not
native transaminase substrates, enzyme engineering was
needed to create highly active (S)- and (R)-selective TAs. We used
molecular docking of keto-sugars and tunnel analysis of
transaminases to create enzymes with the desired equatorial/
axial-selectivity.
2 Results and discussion
2.1 Screening ( R)- and (S)-selective transaminases for
mannosamine and galactosamine synthesis
In this study, C170A and T169G variants of P2O were chosen as
biocatalysts to generate 2-keto-sugars because they have shown
potential in generating 2-keto-glucose and 2-keto-galactose.22
For the transaminase-catalyzed reaction, we used the (R)-selec-
tive TA fromAspergillus fumigatus Af293(Asp) and the (S)-selec-
tive TA from Chromobacterium violaceum (Cvi) as starting
enzymes to investigate their ability for stereoselective C2 amino
sugar synthesis.
25,26 It is important to note that a broad pH
screening of both engineered P2O and transaminase was con-
ducted to identify the best condition to drive the overall reaction
forward. Reactions of the puried TAs were screened using the
o-xylylene diamine assay27 at diﬀerent pH values. Dark-colored
precipitates of isoindoles indicate the desired transaminase

HEPES buﬀer (pH 7) at 30 °C for 12 hours.

activity. Asp-TA showed this dark precipitation at pH 8, 9, 9.5,
and 10, whereasCvi-TA was active from pH 7–10 (Fig. 2A). We
also performed screening with other (S)-selective transaminases
(3HMU from Ruegeria pomeroyi28 and TA10 fromBurkholderia
multivorans).29 However, the negative control reaction of the
diamine assay using 3HMU and TA10 containing sugar
substrate and transaminase (without P2O) showed more dark
precipitate when compared to the negative control reaction of
Cvi-TA (Fig. S2, ESI). We assumed that 3HMU and TA10 might
react with the sugar substrate in its open ring form at the C1
aldehyde position, resulting in the formation of an amino
alcohol. This agrees with the previous ndings reported by
Cairns et al.
15 regarding the direct amination of aldose sugars by
3HMU. Thus, we selectedCvi-TA for galactosamine synthesis as
it had the lowest background activity.
We further conrmed the abilities ofAsp-TA and Cvi-TA in
mannosamine and galactosamine synthesis using one-pot
reactions together with P2O. LC-MS/MS analysis showed that
both transaminases converted 2-keto-glucose and 2-keto-
galactose to yield mannosamine (10% conversion) and galac-
tosamine (15% conversion), respectively (Fig. 2B).
2.2 Elucidating stereospeci city ofCvi-TA andAsp-TA to
keto-sugar by molecular docking
To increase the yields of the mannosamine and galactosamine
syntheses, we engineeredAsp-TA andCvi-TA using semi-rational
methods. Werst identied residues important for binding 2-
keto-sugars and then analyzed the formation of the interme-
diate 2-keto-sugars-PMP complex (the planar quinonoid) using
molecular docking and mechanistic analyses. Based on the
established TA mechanism,
30 we assumed that the second half-
reaction (Fig. 3A) in which the amino group is transferred from
the enzyme-bound PMP to the 2-keto-sugar (step 1) leads to the
formation of a planar quinonoid (step 6). Subsequently, the
catalytic lysine protonates this quinonoid to yield a chiral
amino sugar and this step is crucial for controlling the stereo-
selectivity of the transamination. We thus used CAVER analyst
and molecular docking to identify tunnels and to study the
binding mode of 2-keto-glucose in step 1 to propose the struc-
ture of the planar quinonoid for step 6 (Fig. 3B).
31
We identied thatCvi-TA andAsp-TA have diﬀerent geome-
tries in the formation of the planar quinonoid (step 6), which
leads to diﬀerent orientations for transamination (equatorial or
axial). Analysis of tunnels and molecular docking in Asp-TA
showed that the catalytic lysine (K179) can only donate a proton
to the top face of the pro-chiral imine of the planar quinonoid
(4.0 Å). This proton is then donated to the equatorial position,
resulting in formation of the axial amino sugar inAsp-TA. In
contrast, in Cvi-TA, the catalytic lysine (K288) can only donate
a proton to the bottom face (axial position) of the prochiral
imine (2.6 Å), resulting in formation of the equatorial amino
sugar inCvi-TA (Fig. S3 and S4, ESI).
2.3 Enzyme engineering by site-directed mutagenesis for
enhancing mannosamine and galactosamine synthesis
To further enhance the eﬃciency of the amino sugar synthesis,
we engineered residues located around the binding site of the 2-
keto sugar and the planar quinonoid (Tables S1 and S2, ESI).
Briey, we selected the following residues based on their prox-
imity to specic groups of the 2-keto sugar substrate and the
planar quinonoid intermediate: (i) residues located near the C1
and C2 hydroxyl groups of the 2-keto sugar substrate and the
phosphate group of the planar quinonoid including Y58 and
T273, (ii) residues located near the C3, C4, and C6 hydroxyl
groups of the 2-keto sugar substrate and the hydroxyl group of
the planar quinonoid including R126 and R416, (iii) residues
located near the tunnel of the 2-keto sugar substrate and the
planar quinonoid including F113, W183, and F88. The results
showed that the Asp-TA T273A variant gave the highest man-
nosamine production, with a 2.1-fold increased yield compared

phosphate (PMP) attacks the keto-sugar (step 1). TS2: PMP eliminates water from the keto-sugar (step 4). TS3: Lys abstracts a proton from PMP
forming the planar quinonoid (step 5). TS4: Lys donates a proton to the keto-sugar (step 6). (B) Tunnel analysis and molecular docking of the
keto-sugar to the PMP-bound enzyme and the planar quinonoid intermediate to the apo enzyme were used to identify target residues in enzyme
engineering.

to the wild-type Asp-TA (Fig. 4A). The optimal conditions for
bioconversion were at pH 8 (Fig. 4B), and the ratio of glucose :
(R)-PEA at 1 : 4 (Fig. S5, ESI). For galactosamine synthesis, the
F88Y variant ofCvi-TA gave the highest galactosamine forma-
tion with a 1.5-fold increase compared to the wild-type enzyme
(Fig. 4C). Optimization of the ratio of galactose : (S)-PEA at 1 : 1
and pH 7 gave the highest galactosamine formation (Fig. 4D).
However, when the concentration of (S)-PEA exceeded 5 mM,
galactosamine production decreased greatly possibly due to
substrate inhibition. In contrast, mannosamine synthesis
catalyzed by Asp-TAs showed no substrate inhibition (Fig. S6,
ESI).
2.4 Mannosamine and galactosamine synthesis through
a one-pot reaction using engineered P2O and transaminase
T273A, the best variant from the screening reaction, was used to
synthesize mannosamine and to explore intermediate forma-
tion during multiple turnover reactions of P2O (C170A) andAsp-
TA (T273A). This cascade reaction resulted in 28% conversion to
mannosamine (Table 1). The intermediate 2-keto-glucose
showed a peak early in the process and then decreased as it
was further converted into mannosamine (Fig. S7 and S8, ESI).
We found a peak area at 193m/z which increased during the
reaction progress (Fig. S9, ESI). This peak was likely due to the
second oxidation by P2O followed by the hydrolysis in the last
step to generate 2-keto gluconic acid (193m/z). These results
agree with our previous ndings that sugar acids can be
generated from P2O reactions.
24
The synthesis of galactosamine, utilizing the best variant
F88Y of Cvi-TA and T169G (P2O), achieved 34% conversion
(Table 1). ForD-galactosamine synthesis, we detected formation
of 2-keto galactose as an intermediate and 2-keto galactonic
acid as an alternative product (Fig. S7 and S8, ESI), similar to
those observed during the synthesis of mannosamine. When we
performed glucosamine synthesis to observe patterns of amino
sugar and sugar acid formation using cascade biocatalysis using
the F88Y and C170A variants, we found that glucosamine was
formed (25% conversion) (Table 1) as well as 2-ketogluconic
acid (Fig. S9, ESI). This demonstrates that a one-pot conversion
of common sugars to amino sugars employing P2O and TA is
possible with 25–34% analytical yield; however, formation of
the alternative sugar acid product was also possible.
Docking analysis showed that the T273A variant would allow
an appropriate keto-sugar and planar quinonoid binding
because of a decreased steric eﬀect as this residue is located
near the C2–OH of the keto-sugar (3.5 Å) and the phosphate
group of the planar quinonoid (2.9 Å) inAsp-TA (Table S1). The
F88Y variant may alter sugar binding because the F88 residue is
part of tunnels for keto-sugar access to the active site, possibly
assisting the planar quinonoid formation (Fig. S4, ESI).
According to our in silico model, the hydroxyl group of the
tyrosine 88 side chain can indeed form hydrogen bonds with
sugar molecules. This interaction is crucial for high-aﬃnity
binding as the hydrogen bonds would facilitate precise sugar
binding within the binding tunnel.
For improving amino sugar synthesis, a two-step reaction
setup and the addition of DMSO co-solvent to increase substrate
solubility
32 was utilized to decrease sugar acid formation. The
formation of 2-keto galactose (an intermediate) and sugar acid
(a by-product) was monitored using LC-MS/MS (Fig. S7). These
data allowed us to determine that adding the transaminase aer
4 hours was the optimal time to initiate the second reaction
step. We chose this time point because it yielded the highest
production of 2-keto galactose and the lowest production of
sugar acid. Galactosamine yield could be improved in the two-
step reaction using 10% DMSO, achieving 68% product
formation (Table 2). This condition also reduced the sugar acid
by-product formation to 23% (Table 2). However, one-pot reac-
tions could not be used to improve the yield, possibly due to
enzyme denaturation in the presence of DMSO.

The high polarity and hydrophilicity of sugars make it
challenging to separate amino sugar products using conven-
tional extraction methods. To overcome this, we added the
protecting group uorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) to galac-
tosamine, creating 9-uorenylmethoxycarbonyl-galactosamine
(Fmoc-galactosamine). This product was then puried using
a preparative HPLC (Fig. S10). The purity of Fmoc-
galactosamine was con rmed using high resolution mass
spectrometry (MS) (Fig. S11). Galactosamine was selected for
characterization because it could be obtained with the highest
conversion.
3 Conclusions
In conclusion, P2O and TA variants were used in combination
as valuable biocatalysts for the synthesis of C2 chiral amino
sugars. Our work here presents a novel strategy for the synthesis
of mannosamine and galactosamine using a cascade reaction.
The T273A variant of Asp-TA prefers axial amination and is
suitable for mannosamine production whereas the F88Y variant
of Cvi-TA prefers equatorial amination and can be used for
galactosamine synthesis. Molecular docking explained the
diﬀerences in stereoselectivity ofCvi-TA and Asp-TA. The two-
step sequential reaction catalyzed by the transaminase vari-
ants T169G and F88Y could be used to enhance galactosamine
synthesis and to reduce sugar acid formation. This study
provides a platform for further investigations into the scalable
biosynthesis of structurally diverse amino sugars, which are
valuable for glycoscience and medicinal chemistry. Our study
only presents a foundational enzymatic route for amino sugar
synthesis. To achieve industrial feasibility, future eﬀorts must
focus on optimizing the biocatalytic process and developing
advanced downstream processing technologies to overcome
current challenges.
4 Experimental procedures
4.1 Preparation and purication of enzymes
For P2O preparation, the plasmids containing genes encoding
the P2O variants from (UniProtKB accession: Q7ZA32)33 (C170A
for glucose as a substrate and T169G for galactose as
a substrate) were transformed intoE. coliBL21 (DE3) using the
heat-shock transformation protocol. A single colony corre-
sponding to each variant was selected from an LB agar plate
(supplemented with 50mg per mL ampicillin), inoculated, and
grown in auto-induction medium (100 mL ZYM-5052 auto-
induction medium, 50mg per mL ampicillin). The culture was
incubated overnight in an orbital shaker at 37 °C, 200 rpm. An
overnight culture (5 mL) was inoculated into 6 (Erlenmeyer
ask) × 650 mL of ZYP-5052 auto-induction medium contain-
ing 50 mg per mL ampicillin. The large-scale cell culture was
incubated in an orbital shaker at 37 °C until the absorbance at
600 nm reached 1 (∼3 h). The culture was allowed to grow at 16 °
C overnight and then harvested by centrifugation at 7670× g for
10 min at 4 °C. Cells were stored at−80 °C until used. The yield
of the cell paste was∼50 g per L culture. The cell pellet was lysed
by ultrasonication. P2O variants from crude lysate were puried
using ammonium sulphate precipitation and ion-exchange
DEAE chromatography.

including (i) pET28a-Cvi-TA26 (UniProtKB accession: Q7NWG4),
pET22b-3HMU-TA28 (UniProtKB accession: Q5LMU1), pET28a-
TA10 (ref. 29) (GenBank accession: MT828903) for (S)-selective
transaminases and (ii) pET22b-Asp-TA25 (UniProtKB accession:

plate at 37 °C containing 100mg per mL ampicillin forAsp-TA
and 3HMU-TA, 50mg per mL kanamycin forCvi-TA and TA-10. A
fresh single colony of transformant was inoculated in LB
medium with antibiotic at 37 °C, 150 rpm for 16 h. Terric
Broth medium (TB) and isopropylb-
D-1-thiogalactopyranoside

600 reached 0.8. TA-10 was
induced using 1 mM of IPTG aer the OD600 reached 1.2. The
cultures were shaken (160 rpm) for an additional 16 h. The cell
paste of each transaminase was harvested by centrifugation
(7670 × g, 10 min, 4 °C). The cell pellet of each transaminase
was suspended in lysis buﬀer containing 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5,
300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, and 0.1 mM PLP. Cells were
disrupted by ultrasonication while controlling the temperature
at 15 °C on ice-bath. Cell debris was removed from the super-
natant by centrifugation at 16 128× g at 4 °C for 1 hour. The
immobilized metal aﬃnity chromatography (IMAC) containing
nickel or cobalt was used to purify his-tagged-transaminases.

20 mM imidazole, and 0.1 mM PLP were passed through the
column to remove other proteins. Elution of protein was done
using the wash buﬀer with increasing imidazole to 300 mM. The
yellow transaminase was collected and exchanged into 50 mM
HEPES and 0.1 mM PLP pH 7.5 using PD10 column or Sepha-
dexTM G-25 (GE healthcare) column. The puri ed trans-
aminases were stored at −20 °C containing 20% glycerol.
Transaminases purities were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and the
concentrations were determined by the bicinchoninic acid
assay (BCA assay).
4.2 Screening of (R) and (S)-selective transaminases
A high-throughput screening (HTS) to identify the desired
transaminase activities was performed using the o-xylylene-
diamine assay.
26 The enzyme reactions contained 10 mM sugars
(glucose/galactose), 2mM P2O variants (C170A for glucose and
T169G for galactose), 10mM transaminase, 10 mMo-xylylene-
diamine dihydrochloride with the volume adjusted to 200mLb y
adding diﬀerent buﬀer solutions (50 mM HEPES for pH 7.0–8.0
and 50 mM CHES for pH 8.5–10.0). The plates were incubated at
30 °C in a shaker incubator at 220 rpm overnight. When an
amine group ino-xylylenediamine is converted to an aldehyde,
the resulting aldehyde undergoes intramolecular cyclization
with a second amine group to form an isoindole. This isoindole
is highly reactive, leading to formation of a colored polymeric
product as a dark precipitate. Formation of intensely colored
solutions and signicant quantities of dark precipitation thus
indicate the candidate activities. For a positive control, 10 mM
pyruvate was added instead of sugar. The enzyme reaction
without adding any transaminase or P2O was used as a negative
control.
To conrm formation of mannosamine and galactosamine
in the reactions catalyzed by the (R)- and (S)-selective trans-
aminases, reactions of each transaminase and P2O were carried
out and then analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Reaction mixtures typi-
cally contained 5 mM sugar substrates, 10mM P2O variant, 50
mM transaminase, 2% w/v catalase, 10 mM (R,S)-PEA (as amino
donor) in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5 containing 0.1 mM PLP. A clear
solution aer removing denatured protein by centrifugation
and microcon ultraltration was analyzed using an Agilent 6490
triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with an electrospray
ionization source (ESI) equipped with an ultra-performance
liquid chromatography system (LC-MS/MS) (Agilent tech-
nology, USA). An Asahipak NH2P-50 2D column (150 mm, 5mm,
Shodex) was used for detection of amino sugars. A mobile phase
with 20% v/v 10 mM ammonium acetate and 80% v/v acetoni-
trile at aow rate of 0.3 mL min
−1 was used as an eluent. MS
conditions in LC-MS/MS were set to MRM mode to detect
mannosamine and galactosamine.
4.3 Tunnel analysis and computational molecular docking
4.3.1. Tunnel analysis by CAVER analyst.CAVER analyst 2.0
(ref. 31) was used tond tunnels inCvi-TA andAsp-TA. ForCvi-
TA, the crystal structure of the enzyme in complex with PLP
(PDB: 4a6t) was used.
25 The position of NZ of LYS-288, a catalytic
residue, of Chain A was chosen as a starting point. A minimum
probe radius used was 0.9 Å. ForAsp-TA, the enzyme crystal
structure in complex with PLP (PDB: 4chi) was used.24 The
position of NZ of LYS-179, a catalytic residue, of Chain A was
chosen as a starting point. A minimum probe radius was 0.9 Å.
4.3.2. Molecular docking of 2-keto-glucose.The purpose of
this step is to identify the binding mode of 2-keto-glucose in
step 1 (Fig. 3A) and model the structure of 2-keto-sugars-PMP
complex (the planar quinonoid) for step 6. The structure of 2-
keto-glucose was modied from 3-deoxy-3-uoro-beta-
D-glucose
(3FG) from the crystal structure of H167A P2O in complex with
3FG, PDB 3PL8.34 First, the molecular structure in the gas phase
was optimized to obtain a reasonable starting point. This
process helps understand the geometry and electronic structure
of the molecules without the inuence of solvent or charge. The
gas-phase optimization of 2-keto-glucose was done using
B3LYP
35–37/6-31G(d)38–40 equipped in Gaussian16 program. 41
Then, the PDBles of 4A6T and 4CHI were used asCvi-TA and
Asp-TA structures for calculations, respectively. Ligand and
protein were prepared by AutoDockTools. 42,43 PLP was not
modied to PMP to maintain the original structure as the status
of cofactor should not a ﬀect the binding mode of 2-keto-
glucose. The center of the docking box was the red point on
the tunnel. The docking box size was 25× 25 × 25 Å. Arg-416 in
Chain A ofCvi-TA and Arg-126 in Chain B ofAsp-TA were chosen
as exible residues (its side chain can rotate during docking
calculation) in docking because it has a high dynamic. To assign
protonation states and optimize the hydrogen bond network of
amino acids in proteins, we used PROPKA which is a fast
empirical method that predicts the pK
a values of ionizable
groups in proteins based on their 3D structure.44 The proton-
ation states of amino acids were selected based on PROPKA45
and optimal hydrogen bond network. Crystallographic water
molecules were removed prior to docking. Flexible docking was
performed by AutoDock Vina.

4.3.3. Molecular docking of the planar quinonoid. The
purpose of this step was to identify the binding mode of the
planar quinonoid (2-keto-sugars-PMP complex) in step 6 with
the desired product stereochemistry (Fig. 3A). The structure of
the planar quinonoid was modied based on the structure
derived from pyridoxal-5
0 -phosphate (PLP) and 2-keto-glucose.
The planar quinonoid was subjected to geometry optimization
using the same method described in the previous section. In the
ligand preparation step, the C–N bond of planar quinonoid was
xed to be non-rotatable due to its partial double bond char-
acter. The center of the docking box was C4a of PLP. PLP was
removed from the crystal structure before planar quinonoid
docking. Arg-416 in Chain A ofCvi-TA and Arg-126 in Chain B
and Phe-113 in Chain A ofAsp-TA were chosen as theexible
residues (its side chain can rotate) in docking because it has
a high dynamic. Other parameters of docking are the same as
described in the previous section.
4.4 Enzyme engineering by site-directed mutagenesis
Based on the tunnel analysis and computational molecular
docking of the Cvi-TA and Asp-TA with 2-keto-glucose and
planar quinonoid bound, residues surrounding the binding site

were identied (Tables S1 and S2). Variants of candidate resi-
dues were created using PCR with specic primers (Table S3).
The PCR (50mL) contained plasmids of TAs (2–10 ng), primers
(0.5 mM), dNTPs (200mM), and Phusion™ High–Fidelity DNA
polymerase (0.02 UmL−1). The resulting PCR products were di-
gested by restriction endonucleaseDpn I for 30 minutes at 37 °C
and heat inactivated at 80 °C for 20 minutes. The PCR products
were transformed into competent cellE. coli XL1blue. Desired
mutations were validated by DNA sequencing. Variants were
expressed and puried with the same method described in
Section 4.1.
4.5 Mannosamine and galactosamine synthesis through
bioconversion using transaminase and P2O
To screen variants of transaminase and to optimize the reac-
tions, a solution of P2O and each transaminase variant was
mixed with diﬀerent buﬀer solutions containing 0.1 mM PLP
and 1 mg per mL catalase (50 mM HEPES for pH 7.0–8.0 and
50 mM CHES for pH 8.5–10.0) and diﬀerent ratios of sugar : EA
concentrations. The enzyme reactions contained 5 mM sugars
(glucose/galactose), 1 mM of P2O variants (C170A for glucose
and T169G for galactose), 7 mg per mL transaminase variants
and adjusted volume to 200 mL. This one-pot reaction was
allowed to proceed at 37 °C and shaken at 220 rpm for 12 h. To
follow reaction progress and to observe side product formation,
the reaction volume was adjusted to 10 mL. Samples were
collected and quenched by adding acetonitrile at a ratio of 1.5 :
1 (v/v).
For the two-step sequential reaction, the oxidation of P2O
was set up and 2-keto sugar formation was detected by LC-MS/
MS. The P2O variant was removed using a membraneltration
process using a Microcon ultraltration unit (10 kDa cutoﬀ).
Then, the transaminase reaction was initiated by adding PEA,
DMSO and transaminase variant for 12 h.
4.6 Analysis of production formation by LC-MS/MS mass
spectrometry
All samples were analyzed by LC-MS/MS using an Agilent 6490
triple quadrupole mass spectrometer with an electrospray
ionization source (ESI) equipped with an ultraperformance
liquid chromatography system. The MS conditions in LC-MS/
MS (Table S4) were set to MRM mode to monitor sugar
substrates, amino sugar products and intermediate species. A
preparative column Asahipak NH2P-50 10E (10.0× 250 mm,
5mm) was used for separating sugar substrates, amino sugar
products and intermediates. A mobile phase used was 20% of
10 mM ammonium acetate and 80% acetonitrile at aow rate of
1 mL min
−1 and the column temperature was set at 15 °C.
Multiple turnover reactions of candidate transaminase variants
described above for synthesizing mannosamine and galactos-
amine were analyzed for peak areas of substrate, product and
intermediate at various time points during multiple turnover
reactions. MS/MS data collection were done using qualitative/
quantitative analysis by the MassHunter soware (Agilent).
4.7 Synthesis of 9-uorenylmethoxycarbonyl-galactosamine
The derivatization reaction was conducted in a 0.2 M borate
buﬀer (pH 7.0) containing 129.35 mg L
−1 of Fmoc-Cl and the
reaction sample with 60–150 nmol of galactosamine hydro-
chloride (standard or from the biocatalytic reaction). The
mixture was incubated at 25 °C for 30 minutes. Aer incuba-
tion, the reaction mixture was evaporated and freeze-dried. The
freeze-dried sample was redissolved in a 50 : 50 solution of 2-
propanol and acetonitrile, and thenltered through a 0.22mm
microporous membrane lter for HPLC-DAD analysis and
purication.HPLC analysis was performed using a Fortis C18
column (5 mm, 150 mm × 4.6 mm). The HPLC-diode array
detector (DAD) was set to a wavelength of 254 nm at 30 °C. The
mobile phase consisted of water (A) and acetonitrile (B). A linear
gradient was applied, increasing from 30 to 100% of mobile
phase B over 12 min, followed by a 2-minute hold at 100% of the
mobile phase B. Theow rate was set at 1.0 mL min
−1, with
a 1000mL loop injection. The HPLC-DAD detector was used to
monitor the individual constituents, and fractions of (Fmoc-
galactosamine) were collected based on targeted peak detec-
tion. Thenal product's purity and identity were conrmed by
mass spectrometry (MS).
