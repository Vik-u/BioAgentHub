Abstract
Background Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a prevalent pregnancy-specific complication that 
presents with maternal itching and elevated serum bile acid levels. ICP is associated with unfavorable pregnancy 
outcomes, severely decreasing the pregnant woman’s quality of life. Timely identification of ICP is crucial for effective 
management and improved outcomes.
Methods We collected urine samples from 8 patients with ICP and 8 healthy individuals. We used Liquid 
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) to detect metabolite expression levels, then conducted a series of 
bioinformatic analyses to explore the potential biological meanings of differentially expressed metabolites, and 
preliminarily discovered several candidate biomarkers. To validate these candidate biomarkers, we performed Gas 
Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) detection and analyzed their diagnostic values using receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve.
Results Untargeted metabolomics data showed that 6129 positive peaks and 6218 negative peaks were extracted 
from each specimen. OPLS-DA analysis and the heat map for cluster analysis showed satisfactory capability in 
discriminating ICP specimens from controls. Subsequent analysis extracted 64 significantly differentially expressed 
metabolites, which could be potential biomarkers for diagnosis of ICP . Based on the KEGG enrichment analyses, six 
candidate biomarkers were preliminarily identified. Two most promising biomarkers (3-hydroxypropionic acid and 
uracil) were validated by targeted metabolomics analyses with the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.920 and 0.850 
respectively.

Background
Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is the most 
common pregnancy-specific liver disease character -
ized by generalized pruritus that commonly includes the 
palms and soles, elevated serum total bile acids (TBA), 
and increased liver transaminases [ 1–4]. The symptoms 
occur mostly in the third trimester, but can be earlier in 
pregnancy [ 5]. ICP is associated with multiple adverse 
pregnancy outcomes, including spontaneous and iatro -
genic preterm birth, fetal distress, meconium staining of 
the amniotic fluid, and still birth [ 1–3]. The risk of com -
plications increases with the level of maternal serum 
bile acids, so women with more severe cholestasis are 
at higher risk [ 6–9]. The incidence rate of ICP gener -
ally ranges between 0.2% and 2%, but varies widely with 
ethnicity and geographic location [ 1]. The incidence was 
once reported to be as high as 15.6% among the Arauca -
nos Indians in Chile [10]. On the contrary, a study involv-
ing 1 million women in Sweden estimated the incidence 
to be between 0.32% and 0.58% [ 8]. In the United States, 
the reported incidence rate ranges from 0.32% in Con -
necticut to 5.6% in Los Angeles [11].
The diagnosis of ICP is currently based on pruritus and 
elevated total serum bile acids, with other hepatobiliary 
disease excluded [ 3, 5]. Total serum bile acids concen -
tration has been the most often used biomarkers for the 
diagnosis of ICP in clinical practice [12]. Most studies use 
a cutoff value for ICP ranging from 10 to 14 µmol/L, but 
the diagnostic accuracy is unsatisfactory [ 1, 3, 12]. The 
liver transaminases, mainly aspartate aminotransferase 
(AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), are also com-
monly increased in ICP , but similarly, their sensitivity and 
specificity are not satisfying [ 1, 3]. Alkaline phosphatase 
(ALP) is usually increased as well, but it is a nonspe -
cific indicator of ICP [ 1, 3]. Moreover, serum bilirubin 
is raised in only about 10% of patients [ 1, 3]. Due to dis -
comforting symptoms and severe complications of ICP , 
pharmacologic treatment is required to improve pru -
ritus and prevent fetal complications [ 13]. In recent 20 
years, ursodeoxycholic acid (UCDA) is a commonly-used 
drug that can efficiently alleviate pruritus, improve liver 
function tests, and prevent poor pregnancy outcomes in 
women suffering from ICP [3, 4, 13].
As the pathogenesis of ICP is related to abnormal 
metabolism caused by multiple factors of which genetic 
susceptibility and reproductive hormones are predomi -
nant, serum and urine levels of relevant metabolites 
alter in ICP patients in contrast with normal people [ 3, 
14, 15]. Thereby, discovery of those differential metabo -
lites is beneficial to establishing diagnostic biomarkers 
for ICP . Nonetheless, at present, the commonly used 
diagnostic indicators are several routine inflammatory 
markers with certain limitations, failing to achieve a high 
level of accuracy. As a consequence, novel effective bio -
markers or combined application of several biomark -
ers are urgently demanded. Among diverse approaches 
assessing the metabolites (including mass spectrometry, 
untargeted metabolomics, targeted metabolomics, and 
imaging metabolomics), untargeted metabolomics strat -
egy is prioritized for its rapidity, high throughput and 
sensitivity [ 16, 17]. Fortunately, several metabolic bio -
markers for ICP diagnosis have been reported in previ -
ous studies. For instance, Ma et al. discovered a maternal 
urinary metabolite panel as a non-invasive biomarker for 
ICP diagnosis and suggested several primary causative 
factors in ICP pathogenesis [ 18]. Yurtcu et al. reported 
that four serum adipokine metabolites had predictive and 
diagnostic value in identifying ICP patients [ 19]. Feng et 
al. uncovered that ICP resulted in remarkable alteration 
in serum metabolites of neuropeptide Y [20].
In our current research, we analyzed the differentially 
expressed metabolites in the urine specimens from ICP 
patients via untargeted metabolomics and preliminar -
ily identified several significantly differentially expressed 
serum metabolites as promising biomarkers for diagnosis 
of ICP . Moreover, we conducted targeted metabolomics 
analyses to validate the diagnostic performances of two 
metabolites. Finally, we combined the results of both tar -
geted and untargeted metabolomics and identified two 
underlying diagnostic biomarkers for ICP .
Materials and methods
This project comprised two successive rounds of experi -
mentation. The initial round centered on untargeted 
metabolomics research employing Liquid Chromatogra -
phy-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) technology. The exper -
imental procedures encompassed sample metabolite 
extraction, LC-MS/MS detection, and subsequent data 
analysis. The data analysis encompassed fundamental 
analysis and differential expression analysis. The former 
encompassed data pre-processing, Student’s t-test, prin -
cipal component analysis (PCA), partial least squares-
discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), orthogonal partial least 
squares-discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA), as well as 
Conclusion Based on preliminary screening from untargeted metabolomics and subsequent validation through 
targeted metabolomics, 3-hydroxypropionic acid and uracil were identified as promising diagnostic biomarkers for 
ICP .

screening and identification of differentially expressed 
compounds. The latter encompassed hierarchical clus -
tering analysis, Z-score graphs, correlation heat map 
analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes 
(KEGG) annotation analysis, and metabolomics pathway 
analysis of the differentially expressed metabolites. The 
subsequent round relied on Gas Chromatography-Mass 
Spectrometry (GC-MS) technology for targeted metabo -
lomics research. The experimental procedures primarily 
entailed sample metabolite extraction, enrichment, and 
derivation, GC-MS/MS detection, and subsequent data 
analysis.
Urine sample collection
All urine specimens were collected from Wuxi Mater -
nal and Child Health Care Hospital (Jiangsu, China) and 
preserved in the room with a condition of appropriate 
temperature and humidity. All experimental procedures 
were approved by the Ethics Committee of Wuxi Mater -
nal and Child Health Care Hospital (protocol code: 2020-
01-0310-08). The overview of the patient characteristics 
is presented in Table  1. Urine specimens collected dur -
ing delivery from pregnant women were divided into 2 
groups, the ICP group (T2) and normal group (N2), each 
corresponding to 8 biological replicates, for a total of 16 
specimens. The ICP specimens were collected from the 
patients diagnosed with ICP according to the following 
diagnostic bases——maternal pruritus, abnormal liver 
function (elevated serum AST and ALT levels), increased 
TBA concentrations, and exclusionary diagnosis, while 
the control specimens were acquired from healthy preg -
nant women. Subsequently, in order to enhance the 
robustness of our diagnostic validation for potential bio -
markers, an additional 4 urine specimens, comprising 
two ICP and two control specimens, were incorporated 
into the subsequent targeted metabolomics experiments. 
In short, 16 and 20 urine specimens were collected for 
untargeted metabolomics and targeted metabolomics, 
respectively.
Procedures for untargeted metabolomics
Urine sample preparation
First, 100 µL of each urine specimen was extracted into 
centrifuge tubes. Then, 300 µL of methanol ( Merck, 
Darmstadt Germany) was added to the specimens, mixed 
thoroughly by vortex oscillation, and ultrasonicated at 4 
℃ for 30  min. The specimens were stored at -20 ℃ for 
1  h and then centrifuged at 4 ℃ (15  min, 12,000  rpm). 
After the centrifugation, take 200 µL of supernatant 
and add 5 µL of internal standard (1  mg/mL 2-chloro-
1-phenylalanine, GL Biochem , Shanghai China). Finally, 
the mixture was transferred to LC vials [ 21]. And quality 
control (QC) samples are prepared by mixing equal vol -
umes of extracts from all samples.
UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS analysis
Metabolic profiling of urine specimens was analyzed via 
an analysis platform, LC-MS (Waters, UPLC; Thermo, Q 
Exactive). The column (Waters, ACQUITY UPLC HSS 
T3 1.8 µm, 2.1 mm×100 mm) was employed. Urine speci-
mens were separated by chromatography with the col -
umn temperature at 40 ℃ and the flow rate of 0.3 mL/
min. The mobile phase A consisted of water and 0.05% 
formic acid ( CNW, Shanghai China) while the mobile 
phase B consisted of acetonitrile ( Merck, Darmstadt Ger-
many). The elution gradient was started initially with 
95% A for 1 min, linearly decreased to 5% A at 12 min, 
maintained for 1.6 min, and then returned to 95% A for 
2.4 min of equilibrium. The automatic injector tempera -
ture was 4 ℃, and 5 µL of aliquot of each specimen was 
injected into the column. Time of flight (TOF)/MS was 
conducted on both positive ion mode and negative ion 
mode [21].
Electrospray ionization (ESI) source conditions were 
set as follows: (1) ESI + : heater temperature, 300 ℃; 
sheath gas flow rate, 45 arb; aux gas flow rate, 15 arb; 
sweep gas flow rate, 1 arb; spray voltage, 3.0 KV; capil -
lary temperature, 350 ℃; S-Lens RF level, 30%; (2) ESI- : 
heater temperature, 300 ℃; sheath gas flow rate, 45 arb; 
aux gas flow rate, 15 arb; sweep gas flow rate, 1 arb; spray 
voltage, 3.2 KV; capillary temperature, 350 ℃; S-Lens RF 
level, 60%. The parameters of scan mode were set as fol -
lows: full scan (m/z 70 ~ 1050); data-dependent second -
ary mass spectrometry (dd-MS2, TopN = 10); resolution, 
70,000 (primary mass spectrometry) & 17,500 (secondary 
mass spectrometry). And collision mode was set as high-
energy collisional dissociation (HCD) [21].
Original data pre-processing
After acquiring raw UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS data, we made 
a series of preparation and collation of the raw data for 
more effective analysis. We only retained peak area data 
with no more than 50% null value in one group or in all 
groups. Then we performed missing value recoding on 
the original data by means of the minimum value one-
half method for filling. Finally, to achieve data normaliza-
tion, we implemented a normalization procedure based 
on the total ion current (TIC) of each specimen. [21].
Metabolomics data analysis
The pre-processed data were converted to the Statis -
tics Analysis files and then processed using SIMCA 
software (V14.1, Sartorius Stedim Data Analytics AB, 
Umea, Sweden). Principle component analysis (PCA) 
was preformed and a heat map of hierarchical clustering 
analysis was generated as the unsupervised multivariate 
statistical analysis. Orthogonal partial least squares-dis -
criminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was conducted as a super-
vised method to identify the significant variables with 
Page 4 of 16
Liu et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth           (2023) 23:828 
discriminatory capability, and validity of the OPLS-DA 
model was corroborated by a permutation test with a 
200-time repetition. The variable importance in the pro -
jection (VIP) value of each variable from the OPLS-DA 
model was computed to demonstrate its contribution to 
the classification. Metabolites with the VIP value > 1 were 
further analyzed in Student’s t-test at univariate level to 
evaluate the significance of each metabolite. Metabolites 
with P value < 0.05 were regarded to have statistical sig -
nificance [21].
To assess the differentially expressed metabolites, 
the volcano plot was made for the two groups. Then we 
performed hierarchical clustering analysis to compare 
the difference of metabolite expression mode and con -
ducted a Z-score graph to measure the relative contents 
of metabolites at the same level. What’s more, Pear -
son correlation coefficient was calculated to analyze the

more, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes

Procedures for targeted metabolomics
Urine pretreatment
The standards were weighed precisely with an analytical 
balance and dissolved in water-acetonitrile (V:V = 98:2, 
containing 0.1% formic acid) to obtain the standard stock 
solution, the concentration of which was 1 mg/mL. The 
stock solution was diluted by gradient at concentrations 
of 100 µg/mL (working solution 1), 10 µg/mL, 1 µg/mL, 
and 0.1 µg/mL (working solution 2), respectively. Work -
ing solution 1 was used to prepare the mixed standard 
solution and working solution 2 was used to optimize the 
mass spectrometry conditions. The mixed standard solu -
tion concentrations were 50,000 ng/mL, 20,000 ng/mL, 
10,000 ng/mL, 5000 ng/mL, 2000 ng/mL, 1000 ng/mL, 
500 ng/mL, 200 ng/mL, 100 ng/mL, 50 ng/mL, 20 ng/
mL, 10 ng/mL, 5 ng/mL, respectively. The mixed stan -
dard solutions were filled into 1.5 mL EP tubes, and 100 
µL of the mixed standard and blank solvent of the above 
gradient concentration were respectively absorbed into 
GC derived vials and dried in a rapid centrifugal dryer for 
derivative treatment [22].
Metabolite extraction
Samples stored at -80 ℃ were thawed at room temper -
ature. 100 µL of each sample was added to 1.5 mL EP 
tubes. 300 µL of ice-cold mixture of methanol-acetoni -
trile (V:V = 2:1, containing 7 isotopes internal standard) 
was added, and the mixtures were vortexed for 30 s. The 
whole samples were extracted by ultrasonic for 10  min 
in ice-water bath and then stored at -20 ℃ for 30  min. 
The extract was centrifuged at at 4  °C (12,000  rpm) for 
10  min and 100 uL of supernatant was transferred into 
the wide-lined tubes for evaporation drying. QC samples 
are prepared by mixing equal volumes of extracts from 
all samples. The 15  mg/ mL of methoxylamine hydro -
chloride in anhydrous pyridine (80 µL) was placed into 
the glass derivatization vial containing the residue, vor -
tex agitation was performed for 2  min, and the mix -
ture was incubated in the incubator at 37 °C for 60 min. 
Subsequently, 80 µL of BSTFA with 1% TMCS and 20 
µL n-hexane were added into the mixture, vortex agita -
tion was conducted for 2 min, and then the mixture was 
incubated at 70 °C for 60 min. The samples were placed 
at ambient temperature for 30  min before GC-MS/MS 
analysis [22].
GC-MS/MS analysis
The derivative samples were analyzed on a Trace1310 
gas chromatography system coupled to a TSQ9000 
mass spectrometer with an electron ionization (EI) 
source (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). The specific 
analysis conditions and methods of gas chromatogra -
phy experiment are as follows. A DB-5MS fused-silica 
capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm, Agilent 
J&W Scientific, Folsom, CA, USA) was utilized to sep -
arate the derivatives. The high purity helium (purity 
not less than 99.999%) was used as the carrier gas at a 
constant flow rate of 1.2 mL/min through the column. 
The injector temperature was maintained at 280  °C. 
Injection volume was 1 µL by splitless mode, and the 
solvent delay time was set to 4  min. The initial tem -
perature program of the column incubator was set at 
50 °C for 0.5 min, and then it was increased at a rate of 
15 °C/min to 125 °C for 2 min, 4 °C/min to 210 °C for 
3 min, and finally 15 °C/min to 305 °C for 3 min. The 
specific analysis conditions and methods of mass spec -
trometry (MS) experiment are as follows. The temper -
atures of MS quadrupole and EI source were set to 280 
and 300 °C, respectively. MS data were acquired using 
the selective reaction monitoring (SRM) scan mode 
with a mass scanning range of m/z 40–600. The QC 
samples were injected and detected at regular inter -
vals (every 10 samples) throughout the analytical run 
to provide a set of data from which repeatability can be 
assessed [ 22].
Statistical analysis
After the raw GC-MS/MS data were acquired, the Stu -
dent’ s t-test was used to perform comparisons between 
two groups. A P-value < 0.01 was set as the threshold to 
determine statistical significance. Boxplots showing con -
centrations of candidate biomarkers in 10 ICP specimens 
and 10 control specimens were drawn and the receiver 
operating characteristic (ROC) curves were subsequently 
designed to display diagnostic performances. R 4.0.4 
software (Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, 
Austria) was used to perform data analyses.
Results
Dimension reduction of untargeted metabolomics analysis
We utilized Pareto scaling and 7-fold cross-validation to 
realize the establishment of the PCA model according to 
the molecular characteristics of all the groups from this 
research, including QC samples. The distribution sta -
tus of urine metabolites for the test samples as well as 
QC samples in PCA model was demonstrated in Fig.  1. 
The QC injections were all clustered intensively in PCA 
space. The concordance of the iterative QC injections 
and credible data quality throughout all the specimens

Liu et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth           (2023) 23:828 
unveiled the validity of the metabolic profiling approach 
during the test . Ultimately, we extracted 6129 posi -
tive peaks and 6218 negative peaks in total by means of 
SIMCA software.
We also confirmed the validity of the algorith -
mic model applied in this research by OPLS-DA. As 
reflected in the score plots of OPLS-DA model, appar -
ent division between ICP groups and control groups 
was shown in Fig.  2A and B. Concretely, the explana -
tion rates for Y variable (R²Y) and predictive capability 
(Q²) were 0.97 and 0.718 in positive ion mode, and 0.971 
and 0.609 in negative ion mode, respectively, which cor -
roborated that the OPLS-DA model was stable and reli -
able. In addition, the cross-validation via permutation 
and superposition tests (200 times) certified that no 
models had overfitting performance, supported by spe -
cific intercepts of R 2Y = 0.87, Q 2 = − 0.6 and R 2Y = 0.92, 
Q2 = − 0.46 for positive and negative ion mode, respec -
tively (Fig. 2C and D).
Identification of differently expressed urine metabolites
Metabolites with the variable importance in the proj -
ect (VIP) value > 1 were analyzed by Student’s t-test at 
univariate to examine the differential expression lev -
els. Eventually, 64 differentially expressed metabolites 
(VIP > 1, P < 0.05) were identified altogether as poten -
tial biomarkers for ICP diagnosis. The volcano plot of 
the differentially expressed metabolites were displayed 
in Fig.  3. In ICP samples, we discovered that 8 metabo -
lites increased and 28 metabolites declined in positive 
ion mode (Table  2, Supplemental table). Similarly, 5 
metabolites increased and 23 metabolites decreased in 
negative ion mode (Table  3, Supplemental table). Of all 
the differentially expressed metabolites, the expression 
level of sulfochenodeoxycholic acid increased by 242.58 
times, exhibiting the most significant alteration in nega -
tive ion mode, followed by cholic acid with an increase by 
55.97 times.
Then, we utilized the heat map of hierarchical cluster -
ing analysis as another effective strategy to assess the 
relationship between ICP samples and normal samples 
and uncover the expression differences of metabolic 
profiles distinctly. In Fig.  4, we can observe the similar -
ity between the metabolite abundance profiles, display -
ing a desirable discerning ability between the two groups. 
Additionally, in order to measure the relative abun -
dance of metabolites at the same level, we computed the 
Z-scores of the metabolites and draw a graph to display 
the results (Supplemental Figure S1). To examine the 
consistency of the trend between two metabolites, we 
calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient and ana -
lyzed the correlation between all metabolites as shown in 
Fig. 5. In this figure, p-Coumaric acid and androsterone 
had a strongly positive correlation between their chang -
ing trends, indicating a related biological behavior, while 
adenine and acetylproline had a remarkably negative 
correlation.

analysis and topological analysis), 29 pathways associated

with differentially expressed metabolites were observed. 
Among all pathways, remarkably enriched terms incor -
porated D-Glutamine and D-glutamate metabolism, his -
tidine metabolism, beta-Alanine metabolism, primary 
bile acid biosynthesis, steroid hormone biosynthesis, etc. 
(Fig. 6). Notably, steroid hormone biosynthesis possessed 
the largest number of overlapped compounds, which 
could play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of ICP . The 
differentially expressed metabolites (also named as hit 
compounds in KEGG pathway analysis) in five remark -
ably enriched pathways were shown in Table  4, and 
through the intersection of KEGG analysis results and 64 
different metabolites previously screened, six candidate 
biomarkers were preliminarily identified——3-hydroxy -
propionic acid, L-histidine, L-glutamic acid, D-gluta -
mine, uracil, and 5,6-dihydrouracil. Taking into account 
the data in Tables  2 and 3, two differentially expressed 
metabolites (3-hydroxypropionic acid and uracil) were 
finally identified as promising diagnostic biomarkers for 
I C P.
Validation of diagnostic performances of two candidate 
biomarkers
The quality control analysis result showed the high 
degree of curve overlap in total ion current diagram, 
indicating the consistency of retention time and peak 
intensity of technical duplicate samples collected in 
different time periods, as well as good signal stability 
of mass spectrometry and liquid phase system (Supple -
mental Figure S2). Based on the GC-MS/MS analysis, 
we obtained the concentrations of 3-hydroxypropi -
onic acid and uracil in all urine specimens, discovering 
that the average concentration of 3-hydroxypropionic 
acid in the ICP group was significantly lower than that 
in the control group with fold change of 0.332 and 
P-value < 0.01 (Fig.  7A; Table  5). Comparable findings

were presented in uracil with fold change of 0.454 and 
P-value < 0.01 (Fig.  7B; Table 5). The receiver operating 
characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was subsequently 
conducted to display the diagnostic performances of 
3-hydroxypropionic acid and uracil. In Fig.  7C and D, 
the area under the curve (AUC) of 3-hydroxypropionic 
acid and uracil was 0.920 and 0.850 respectively, show -
ing relatively ideal diagnostic performances. The spe -
cific cutoff value, sensitivity, specificity, and Youden 
index were given in Table  6. Actually, we conducted the 
GC-MS/MS experiment to analyze a metabolite panel 
consisting of 100 acid metabolites, with 3-hydroxy -
propionic acid and uracil included. Several remark -
ably downregulated acid metabolites were screened 
as candidate biomarkers with fold change < 0.5 and 
P-value < 0.05 (Table 5).
Discussion
With the progression in high-throughput sequencing 
technologies (e.g. gene chips) and high-performance 
liquid chromatography, it is easier for investigators 
to study diagnostic biomarkers [ 23, 24]. In the mean -
time, technological breakthroughs accelerate the con -
cept of multi-omics to come into researchers’ minds, 
and multi-faceted research of the transcriptome, pro -
teome, and metabolome may motivate us to more pro -
foundly explore the functions and mechanisms of these 
biomarkers [25]. Good news is that an increasing num -
ber of novel biomarkers are preliminarily discovered 
to have a relatively idea performance in diagnosing 
ICP , supported by trials of clinical diagnostic accuracy. 
Three lncRNAs (ASO3480, ENST00000505175.1, and 
ENST00000449605) were identified by Zou et al. from 
Fig. 3 Volcano plot of the differentially expressed metabolites (merged mode). The Y coordinate was -log10 (P value) and the X coordinate was log2 (fold 
change). Each dot represented a metabolite. Red dots were the upregulated metabolites of significant expression levels. Blue dots were downregulated 
metabolites of significant expression levels. Black dots were metabolites of non-significant difference. The cutoff standard was set to P value<0.05

Liu et al. BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth           (2023) 23:828 
143 differentially expressed lncRNAs, remarkably down -
regulated in the ICP group [ 26]. The combined use of 
these three lncRNAs is a more credible tool to diagnose 
ICP and may be a complement for TBA diagnosis [ 26]. 
Dong et al. reported that peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase 
1 (ACOX1), L-palmitoylcarnitine, glycocholic acid, and 
their combination were promising biomarkers for the 
diagnosis and prediction of ICP during the first-, sec -
ond- and third-trimester by means of metabolomics 
and proteomics [ 4]. In a pseudo-targeted metabolomics 
study conducted by Cui et al., a promising combination 
biomarker consisting of α-MCA, TCA, and Gtri-8 was 
uncovered to possess an idea diagnostic performance 
(AUC = 0.996, YI = 0.940) and to be superior to serum 
TBA for ICP diagnosis [27].
Metabolomics is the scientific study of the complete 
set of small molecules, or metabolites, present in an 
organism’s cells, tissues, or biofluids. These metabolites 
encompass a wide range of compounds including lip -
ids, amino acids, sugars, nucleotides, and others [ 16]. 
Metabolomics aims to comprehensively analyze and 
understand the dynamic changes in these metabolites 
in response to various biological processes, environ -
mental factors, and diseases [ 28]. There are two main 
approaches in metabolomics: targeted metabolomics 
and non-targeted metabolomics. Targeted metabolomics

involves the quantification of a predefined set of specific 
metabolites or metabolic pathways. Researchers select 
a subset of metabolites relevant to their research ques -
tion and use high-sensitivity analytical techniques, such 
as mass spectrometry, to precisely measure the concen -
trations of these selected metabolites. This approach is 
often employed when the focus is on known pathways or 
biomarkers, allowing for accurate and specific quantifica-
tion. It provides precise quantification of selected metab -
olites and is suitable for detecting low concentrations of 
metabolites [29]. Untargeted metabolomics aims to com-
prehensively profile the entire metabolome without prior 
selection of specific metabolites [ 30, 31]. This approach 
utilizes high-resolution analytical techniques, such as 
mass spectrometry coupled with chromatography, to 
detect and identify a wide range of metabolites, includ -
ing both known and unknown compounds. So it enables 
the detection of known and unknown metabolites, pro -
viding a holistic view. At the same time, it generates large 
amounts of data requiring complex analysis and may not 
offer the same level of accurate quantification as targeted 
approaches. Targeted and Untargeted metabolomics 
approaches can complement each other. Targeted metab-
olomics can offer precise quantitative information about 
specific metabolites, while untargeted metabolomics pro-
vides a broader overview and the potential to discover 
novel metabolites. Additionally, targeted metabolomics 
can be used to validate findings from untargeted metabo-
lomics, confirming changes in specific metabolites or 
pathways.
In our untargeted metabolomics analysis, the most 
significant pathways are beta-alanine metabolism, his -
tidine metabolism and D-Glutamine and D-glutamate 
metabolism according to the P-value of the KEGG 
pathway analysis. Being the only naturally occurring 
non-essential beta amino acid, beta-Alanine is metabo -
lized by carnosine and acts as a buffer in the cell [ 32]. 
Beta-Alanine metabolism starts with a product of aspar -
tate metabolism and then undergoes phosphorylation 
through an ATP-driven pantothenate kinase [ 33]. Pan -
tothenate, vitamin B5, is a precursor for synthesis of 
4’-phosphopantetheine moiety of coenzyme A and acyl 
carrier protein [ 34, 35]. Histidine biosynthesis is inher -
ently linked to the pathways of nucleotide formation.

Histamine arises in many tissues by the decarboxylation 
of histidine, which in excess causes constriction or dila -
tion of various blood vessels, which may be related to 
postpartum hemorrhage in some ICP patients. Histidine 
is also a precursor for carnosine biosynthesis (via car -
nosine synthase), with beta-alanine being the rate limit -
ing precursor [ 36]. It is a very important amino acid in 
keeping a moderate pH in the body, as it acts as a shut -
tle for protons to maintain a balance of acids and bases 
in the blood and different tissues [ 36, 37]. D-glutamic 
acid is naturally found primarily in the cell wall of cer -
tain bacteria [ 37]. Glutamine is the most abundant free 
amino acid in circulating and intracellular library [ 38]. It 
works in many biology syntheses: substrate for protein 
synthesis, anabolic precursor for muscle growth, sub -
strate for hepatic and renal gluconeogenesis, precursor 
for glutathione production, etc. [ 39]. Glutamine plays a 
central role in fetal carbon and nitrogen metabolism and 
act as a substrate to meet the growing demand for ATP , 
biosynthetic precursors and reducing agents in divid -
ing cells [ 38, 40]. Specific amino acid transporters allow 
glutamine to enter the cell, which is then converted into 
glutamate in the mitochondria, which is a precursor to 
the TCA cycle intermediate alpha ketoglutaric acid [ 41]. 
The increase of glutamate metabolites may indicate the 
increase of energy expenditure requirement during the 
development of ICP .
In our targeted metabolomics analysis, 3-hydroxypro -
pionic acid and uracil were validated as promising bio -
markers, implying that some urine metabolites which 
might reflect the metabolic characteristics are gradually 
being recognized. 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP), a 
three-carbon organic acid with a hydroxyl group on the 
second carbon, is an intermediate metabolite during pro -
pionate metabolism in the human body. 3-HP has been 
investigated for its potential as a biomarker for meta -
bolic disorders, such as nocturia [ 42] and its diagnostic 
and prognostic values in disease management deserve 
further exploration. However, no study has reported a 
clear relationship between 3-HP and ICP . Uracil belongs 
to the family of nucleotide bases, which are the building 
blocks of DNA and RNA. In humans, uracil is primarily 
found in RNA, where it pairs with adenine to form the 
base pairs that make up the RNA molecule. Uracil can be 
used as a biomarker in many diseases, including cancers, 
infections, and metabolic disorders. Specifically, the pres-
ence of uracil in urine or plasma can indicate DNA dam -
age and abnormal cell growth and some researchers have 
proposed that uracil can be utilized in prostate cancer 
diagnosis [ 43]. Similarly, the detection of uracil in urine 
or blood can help to diagnose and monitor the progres -
sion of infection such as the clinical diagnosis of multiple 
traumas complicated with sepsis [ 44]. Also, the level of

uracil in urine or blood can function as an indicator to 
diagnose and monitor the treatment of hereditary orotic 
aciduria [ 45]. Although our research revealed 3-HP and 
uracil had relatively ideal diagnostic performances, this 
still requires further validation from larger sample-size 
trials. The combined examination of novel biomark -
ers and traditional inflammatory biomarkers has been 
demonstrated to enhance diagnostic performance [ 46], 
so the level of 3-HP (or uracil) should be combined with 
levels of TBA, AST, ALT, or ALP for further validation 
in future work. What’s more, our targeted metabolomics 
experiment suggested several extra underlying biomark -
ers (Table 5) that demand further verification due to their 
insignificant changes in the untargeted metabolomics 
experiment.
This study has three limitations. First, our experi -
ment was designed as a controlled study with a small 
patient number of only 10 ICP specimens and 10 
control specimens. On condition that more speci -
mens are acquired, our experiment will end up with 
more satisfactory results. Second, we only analyzed 
the urine specimens. The metabolites in the urine 
can be affected more or less by the renal processing. 
If serum specimens can be obtained, the results of our 
study may be more precise and meaningful. Last, our 
research is lacking in profound analysis of ICP patho -
genesis from a metabolic perspective. Mechanistic 
studies are still in infancy, deserving deeper explora -
tion in future work.

between all metabolites were calculated to analyze the correlation between each metabolite. When the linear relationship between the two metabolites 
is enhanced, the positive correlation tends to 1 (blue dots), and the negative correlation tends to -1 (red dots). Statistical significance test was conducted 
for metabolite correlation analysis, and the threshold of significant correlation was selected with significance level P-value < 0.05

Conclusion
Through preliminary screening from untargeted metab -
olomics and validation from targeted metabolomics, 
3-hydroxypropionic acid and uracil were identified as 
promising diagnostic biomarkers for ICP with AUC of 
0.920 and 0.850 respectively. Nonetheless, this experi -
ment was performed as a controlled study with a small 
sample size. The diagnostic performances of 3-hydroxy -
propionic acid and uracil still demand more convincing 
validation from multicenter clinical trials with large sam -
ple sizes in future research.
