INTRODUCTION
Plastics are versatile materials that are lightweight, 
strong and chemically resistant. These desirable prop -
erties have made them an integral part of daily activi -
ties, infrastructure and economies since their invention 
in the 20th century (Andrady & Neal, 2009 ). Although 
plastics have been an economic boon, particularly in 
packaging and construction applications, their use has 
produced unsustainable levels of waste. From 1950 to 
2015, about 4900 megatons, accounting for 59% of all 
plastics ever produced, have been discarded into land-
fills and the environment (Geyer et al., 2017 ). Ninety 
percent of plastics produced—consisting of polyeth -
ylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride 
(PVC), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyurethane 
(PU) and polystyrene (PS) (Geyer et al., 2017 )—are 
projected to persist for hundreds of years; they are not 
biodegradable on timescales relative to their end of use 
(Chamas et al., 2020). Consequently, their bioaccumu-
lation poses threats to ecosystems and, potentially, 
to human health (Wang et al., 2019 ; Xu et al., 2020 ; 
Yuan et al., 2022 ). Annual plastic waste generation 
is projected to almost triple by 2060 compared to 
2019 levels if trends in current plastic usage continue 
(OECD, 2022). Even with immediate implementation of 
ambitious strategies for waste management, environ -
mental recovery and reduction of plastic production, 
conservative estimates suggest that plastic waste en -
tering terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems will exceed or 
remain close to 2016 levels between 2030 and 2040 
(Borrelle et al., 2020; Lau et al., 2020).
Although PE, PP, PVC, PET, PU and PS are re -
ferred to as non-  biodegradable, some microbes and 
insects have ways to metabolise these plastics into 
their constituent molecules, which can then be used

Abstract
Wastewater treatment plants are one of the major pathways for microplastics 
to enter the environment. In general, microplastics are contaminants of 
global concern that pose risks to ecosystems and human health. Here, we 
present a proof-  of- concept for reduction of microplastic pollution emitted 
from wastewater treatment plants: delivery of recombinant DNA to bacteria 
in wastewater to enable degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET). 
Using a broad- host- range conjugative plasmid, we enabled various bacterial 
species from a municipal wastewater sample to express FAST-  PETase, 
which was released into the extracellular environment. We found that FAST- 
PETase purified from some transconjugant isolates could degrade about 
40% of a 0.25 mm thick commercial PET film within 4 days at 50°C. We then 
demonstrated partial degradation of a post-  consumer PET product over 
5–7 days by exposure to conditioned media from isolates. These results 
have broad implications for addressing the global plastic pollution problem by 
enabling environmental bacteria to degrade PET.

as carbon and energy sources (Brandon et al., 2018 ; 
Chattopadhyay, 2022; Jeon & Kim, 2016; Maheswaran 
et al., 2023; Yoshida et al., 2016 ). These natural pro -
cesses are relatively slow, taking weeks to months for 
significant biodegradation to occur (Gao & Sun, 2021; 
Kumar et al., 2023 ; Maheswaran et al., 2023 ; Sekhar 
et al., 2016; Shah et al., 2008 ; Yoshida et al., 2016 ). 
Among the most produced plastics, PET is a hydro -
lysable polymer that is widely used in the packaging 
and textile industries. Compared to other common plas-
tics, PET is more amenable to biodegradation due to 
the presence of hydrolysable ester bonds. Substantial 
progress has been made in enzymatic PET depo -
lymerisation for resource recovery (Liu et al., 2023). 
For example, PET hydrolase (PETase) from Ideonella 
sakaiensis has been subject to numerous protein en -
gineering efforts that have resulted in PETase variants 
with depolymerisation rates orders of magnitude higher 
than the wild-  type enzyme, and with greater thermo-  
and chemostability (Bell et al., 2022; Cui et al., 2021; Lu 
et al., 2022; Son et al., 2019; Zurier & Goddard, 2023). 
Efforts have also been made to optimise expression 
and secretion of PET- degrading enzymes in some bac-
terial species other than Escherichia coli (Li et al., 2023; 
Wang et al., 2020; Yan et al., 2021), and developments 
are ongoing for employing naturally occurring and de -
signer microbial communities to degrade PET (Gao & 
Sun, 2021; Maheswaran et al., 2023 ; Qi et al., 2021 ; 
Roberts et al., 2020).
Effluent and sludge from wastewater treatment 
plants are major pathways by which microplastics enter 
the environment (Liu et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2019; Zurier 
& Goddard, 2021 ). Notably, a recent study reported 
that 6% of plastic processed at a recycling facility was 
found as microplastics in the facility's wash water post- 
filtration (Brown et al., 2023). Secondary treatment pro-
cesses and digestion of sludge offer opportunities for 
the removal of microplastics through bioaugmentation. 
As reviewed by Zurier and Goddard ( 2021), microbial 
communities could be supplemented with engineered 
bacteria that secrete plastic-  degrading enzymes (i.e., 
cell bioaugmentation); this can be more cost-  effective 
than continuously supplementing a cocktail of purified 
enzymes into a secondary treatment unit.
A major challenge with the cell bioaugmentation 
approach is persistence of the introduced microorgan -
isms, which are often not adapted to the environment 
at hand and are therefore likely to be quickly eliminated 
(Albright et al., 2022; Ma et al., 2022). As an alternative 
strategy that would bypass these barriers to establish -
ment, we propose genetically engineering microbes na-
tive to the environment to express metabolic pathways 
for biodegradation of plastic waste. This approach, 
known as genetic bioaugmentation, can be achieved 
through in situ delivery of broad- host- range conjugative 
plasmids. Genetic bioaugmentation has been shown 
to improve persistence of the introduced functionality 
when using donor strains native to their environment 
(Ronda et al., 2019). Genetic bioaugmentation has not 
yet been applied for bioremediation of plastic waste, 
but this technique has been used to introduce catabolic 
genes into microbial communities for bioremediation 
of non-  plastic- based pollutants in laboratory and pilot 
scale settings (Bathe et al., 2004; Chettri et al., 2023; 
French et al., 2020; Garbisu et al., 2017; Ke et al., 2022; 
Ren et al., 2018 ; Top et al., 2002 ; Venkata Mohan 
et al., 2009).
In this proof-  of- concept study, we lay a foundation 
for the use of genetic bioaugmentation for bioremedi -
ation of PET. We genetically engineered bacteria in a 
municipal wastewater sample to degrade PET plastics 
by delivering a broad-  host- range, conjugating plasmid 
carrying the FAST- PETase gene (Lu et al., 2022), which 
codes for an engineered PET hydrolase that is more 
robust to pH and temperature ranges and is orders of 
magnitude more efficient than the wild-  type enzyme 
(Lu et al., 2022). We assessed degradation of commer-
cial PET film using purified FAST- PETase from several 
engineered isolates. We then measured degradation 
of post-  consumer PET using conditioned media from 
some of the engineered isolates. This report provides 
a foundation to support the next steps in assessing the 
performance and efficacy of such a genetic bioaug -
mentation approach.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Bacterial strains
Escherichia coli  DH5α (Matthew Scott Lab, University 
of Waterloo) and NEB10-  β (New England Biolabs 
(NEB), Whitby, Ontario, Canada) were used for cloning 
steps. E. coli K- 12 (ΔilvD::FRT, ΔgalK::cfp- bla, pSAS31, 
pTGD, pFAST- PETase- cis) was used as a conjugative 
donor strain for matings with wastewater samples. 
Engineered wastewater isolates (see “ Experimental 
Procedures” section) were used for protein expression 
as indicated.
Plasmid construction
All polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification 
steps were performed using Phusion DNA polymerase 
(NEB, Whitby, Ontario, Canada). Primers used for 
PCR amplification were ordered from Integrated 
DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, Iowa, United 
States) and are listed in Data S3 . PCR products were 
assembled using NEB Hifi DNA Assembly Master Mix 
(NEB) according to the manufacturer instructions. 
pNuc- trans- mCherry was constructed by replacing 
mRFP under the P bs promoter on pNuc-  trans- mRFP 
(Hamilton et al., 2019 ) (a gift from Thomas Hamilton 
   | 3 of 14
ENGINEERED WASTEWATER BACTERIA DEGRADE PET
and David Edgell, Western University) with mCherry . 
The backbone of pNuc-  trans- mRFP was amplified 
using primers AY- 9 and AY- 10, and mCherry from pBT1- 
proD- mCherry (Addgene plasmid #65823, gift from 
Xiaoxia Lin, University of Michigan) using primers AY- 7 
and AY- 8, followed by heat shock transformation into E. 
coli DH5α. pFAST- PETase- trans was assembled using 
PCR- amplified fragments from pNuc-  trans- mCherry 
(primers OM- 5 and OM- 6), pFA6a- link- yoEGFP- SpHis5 
(primers OM-  8 and OM-  9) (Addgene plasmid #44836) 
and pBTK522::FAST-  PETase (Lu et al., 2022 ) (gift 
from Hal Alper, University of Texas at Austin) (primers 
OM- 1 and OM-  2), and was subsequently transformed 
into E. coli DH5 α by heat shock. pFAST-  PETase- cis 
was constructed by amplifying pFAST-  PETase- trans 
(primers DE- 3124 and DE- 3125) (Hamilton et al., 2019) 
with 60- bp homologous overlaps to the AvrII cut site in 
pTA- Mob (Strand et al., 2014 ). The pTA-  Mob plasmid 
(gift from Thomas Hamilton and David Edgell, Western 
University) was linearised using AvrII (NEB) and 
combined with the amplified fragment from pFAST- 
PETase- cis using a modified NEB Hifi Assembly 
protocol with a 2 h assembly step at 50°C, followed by 
electroporation into electrocompetent E. coli NEB10-  β.
Filter- mating conjugation and selection of 
engineered isolates
An auxotrophic donor strain was constructed by filter- 
mating E. coli NEB10-  β (pFAST-  PETase- cis) with E. 
coli K- 12 (ΔilvD::FRT, ΔgalK::cfp- bla, pSAS31, pTGD) 
(gift from Xiaoxia Lin, University of Michigan) using 
a procedure similar to that described in Malwade 
et al. (2017). Transconjugants were selected on Luria- 
Bertani (LB) plates (10 g/L tryptone, 10 g/L NaCl, 5 g/L 
yeast extract, 15 g/L agar) supplemented with ampicillin 
(100 μg/mL), gentamycin (50 μg/mL) and kanamycin 
(50 μg/mL) and were used as donors in filter-  mating 
procedures with wastewater samples.
Untreated wastewater samples were collected from 
the City of Waterloo wastewater system access point 
(Wayne Parker lab, University of Waterloo, Ontario, 
Canada) and were processed the same day. About 50 
mL of wastewater were filtered through a sterile 0.40 μm- 
pore polycarbonate filter (Sigma-  Aldrich, Oakville, 
Ontario, Canada) under vacuum. The filter and its 
contents were then vortexed in 1 mL of 1× phosphate- 
buffered saline (PBS; 2.56 g/L Na 2HPO4·7H2O, 8 g/L 
NaCl, 0.2 g/L KCl, 0.2 g/L KH 2PO4) for 1 min. Three 
washes, consisting of centrifuging for 5 min at 4000 × g 
followed by resuspension in 1× PBS, were then com -
pleted. The solution was resuspended to an OD 600 of 
0.5. The donor strain, which was grown overnight from 
a single colony in LB medium (10 g/L tryptone, 10 g/L 
NaCl and 5 g/L yeast extract) supplemented with appro-
priate antibiotics, was diluted 1:50 in LB with appropriate 
antibiotics and was grown at 37°C with shaking until 
exponential phase (OD 600 of ~0.5). The donor culture 
was then pelleted by centrifugation and resuspended to 
an OD of 0.5 in 1× PBS. Filter- mating of the donor cul -
ture and collected solids from the wastewater sample 
was completed by adding 100 μL of each onto a sterile 
0.4 μm- pore polycarbonate filter placed on R2A agar 
(0.5 g/L yeast extract, 0.5 g/L proteose peptone no. 3, 
0.5 g/L casamino acids, 0.5 g/L glucose, 0.5 g/L solu -
ble starch, 0.3 g/L sodium pyruvate, 2.2 mM KH 2PO4, 
0.2 mM MgSO4 and 15 g/L agar). Mating was allowed to 
occur for ~24 h before the filters were vortexed in 1 mL 
of 1× PBS for 1 min, and serial dilutions were plated on 
M9 glucose agar (2 g/L glucose, 2 mM MgSO4, 0.1 mM 
CaCl2, 64 g/L Na 2HPO4·7H2O, 15 g/L KH 2PO4, 2.5 g/L 
NaCl, 5.0 g/L NH 4Cl and 15 g/L agar) supplemented 
with 50 μg/mL gentamycin and 100 μg/mL ampicillin. 
Plates were incubated at 30°C until transconjugants 
appeared, which were observed after 1–2 days as red/
pink colonies. Colonies that were identified as express-
ing mCherry based on fluorescence at 670 nm (Cy5 
channel) using a Chemidoc MP Imaging System (Bio- 
Rad, Mississauga, Ontario, Canada) were streaked 
onto M9 glucose plates supplemented with 50 μg/mL 
gentamycin and 100 μg/mL ampicillin until pure cultures 
were obtained.
Conjugation efficiency in wastewater 
conditions
Untreated wastewater samples were collected from 
the City of Waterloo wastewater system access point 
(Wayne Parker lab, University of Waterloo) and were 
processed the same day. The donor strain E. coli K- 12 
(ΔilvD::FRT, ΔgalK::cfp- bla, pSAS31, pTGD, pFAST- 
PETase- cis) was grown from a single colony overnight 
in LB supplemented with 0.2% glucose and appropriate 
antibiotics, then diluted 1:50 into fresh LB with glucose 
and antibiotics. Once the donor strain reached an 
OD600 = 0.4–0.6, 50 mL of donor culture was washed 
twice in sterile 1× PBS and resuspended in 50 mL of 
sterile 1× PBS. Then, 5 mL of donor culture were added 
to either 20 mL of wastewater or 20 mL of wastewater 
with 10× concentrated solids (prepared by centrifuging 
200 mL of wastewater at 2550 × g for 15 min and 
decanting 180 mL of supernatant) in a 50 mL falcon 
tube, then incubated for 24 h at 30°C with 60 rpm 
shaking. After 24 h, 1 mL of culture was washed twice 
in sterile 1× PBS. Serial dilutions of this mixture were 
then plated on selective M9 glucose plates containing 
gentamycin and ampicillin and on non-  selective M9 
glucose plates. The plates were incubated at 30°C for 
5 days. Transconjugants were enumerated by counting 
colonies identified as expressing mCherry  by visual 
inspection and by imaging under the Cy5 channel on 
a Chemidoc MP Imaging System. Total recipients were

YIP  et al.
enumerated by counting colonies on non-  selective 
plates. Conjugation efficiency was determined as the 
ratio of transconjugants to the total of recipients plus 
transconjugants.
Plasmid stability
A single colony was inoculated into 3 mL of LB media 
and grown at 30°C with shaking. The culture was 
diluted 1:1000 into 3 mL of fresh growth medium once 
per day. At selected time points (Days 1, 3, 7, 10 and 
14), the culture was serially diluted in sterile 1× PBS 
and plated on selective (gentamycin at 50 μg/mL and 
ampicillin at 100 μg/mL) and non-  selective LB plates. 
Plates were incubated at 30°C for 16–24 h, and colony 
forming units were counted manually on each plate to 
quantify the cell density.
Protein expression and purification
A single colony was inoculated into LB supplemented 
with ampicillin (100 μg/mL) and gentamycin (50 μg/
mL) and grown overnight at 30°C with shaking. The 
overnight culture was then diluted 1:50 into 50 mL of LB 
supplemented with ampicillin and gentamycin. Protein 
expression was induced with 0.2% arabinose when 
the OD600 of the culture reached 0.6–0.8, after which 
the cells were cultured for ~20 h at 30°C with shaking. 
For purification of FAST-  PETase from cell extracts, 
50 mL of induced culture was centrifuged at 2550 × g 
for 15 min at 4°C and resuspended in 10 mL of cold 
lysis buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 
10 mM imidazole, pH 7.4). The cells were incubated on 
ice with 0.1 mg/mL lysozyme for 30 min. The cells were 
further lysed by sonication in three 1 min intervals each 
followed by 1 min cool- down (Qsonica XL- 2000, 3.2 mm, 
8 W). Cell debris was pelleted at 2550 × g for 30 min, 
and the 6× His- tagged FAST- PETase was purified from 
the supernatant by Ni- NTA affinity chromatography. To 
perform this purification, 1 mL of 50% Ni-  NTA agarose 
(Qiagen, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) was equilibrated 
using 10 bed volumes of wash buffer (same formulation 
as lysis buffer). The cell lysate was passed through the 
column, followed by washing twice with 10 bed volumes 
of wash buffer twice. The bound proteins were eluted 
using an imidazole step gradient of 50, 75, 100 and 
250 mM in five elution steps using two bed volumes of 
elution buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 300 mM NaCl, 
pH 7.4. Imidazole concentrations in each elution step 
were 50, 75, 100, 250 and 250 mM, respectively). For 
purification of FAST- PETase from culture supernatant, 
50 mL of induced culture were centrifuged at 2550 × g 
and 4°C for 30 min, and FAST-  PETase was purified 
from the supernatant using the same chromatography 
procedure described above.
Protein purity for each elution was checked by SDS- 
PAGE using stain-  free imaging on a Chemidoc MP 
Imaging System. The purified protein from elutions 
containing the fewest contaminating proteins (typi -
cally elution steps 3–5) was concentrated in 1× PBS 
using a 5 kDa cut- off Vivaspin Centrifugal Concentrator 
(Sartorius, Oakville, Ontario, Canada). Protein con -
centrations were determined using the micro-  BCA 
assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Mississauga, Ontario, 
Canada), where protein concentrations were correlated 
to bovine serum albumin standards at an absorbance 
of 562 nm in a plate reader.
PET sample preparation
Amorphous PET (aPET) film from GoodFellow 
(Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, United States; product 
ES301445; specification: 0.25 mm thick, 1.300–
1.400 g cm−3 density, 1.580–1.640 refractive index, 10
0 × 10−13 cm3·cm cm−2 s−1 Pa−1 permeability to water at 
25°C) and post-  consumer PET (pcPET) (coffee cup 
lid No. A626P, Amhil North America, Mississauga, 
Ontario, Canada) were prepared in circular form (aPET: 
7 mm diameter, pcPET: 6 mm diameter) using office 
hole punchers. The PET discs were washed for 30 min 
with 1% SDS, 20% ethanol and distilled water, and dried 
overnight at 50°C. Prior to degradation experiments, 
individual PET discs were weighed on an analytical 
balance with an accuracy of ±0.1 mg.
PET degradation assay with purified 
FAST- PETase
A single, pre- weighed aPET disc was placed in a 2 mL 
polypropylene microcentrifuge tube with 600 μL of 0.1 M 
KH2PO4- NaOH buffer (pH 8.0) with 3.6 μg of purified 
protein concentrate (corresponding to 200 nM FAST- 
PETase). The tube was capped to prevent volatilisation. 
The sample was incubated at 50°C for 96 h, replenishing 
with fresh buffer and enzyme solution every 24 h to 
maximise the degradation rate. The PET samples were 
subsequently washed with 1% SDS, 20% ethanol and 
distilled water, dried for 24 h at 50°C and then weighed 
on an analytical balance to determine weight loss.
PET degradation with culture supernatant
A single colony was inoculated into 10 mL of M9 
glycerol (4 g/L glycerol, 2 mM MgSO 4, 0.1 mM CaCl 2, 
64 g/L Na 2HPO4·7H2O, 15 g/L KH 2PO4, 2.5 g/L NaCl 
and 5.0 g/L NH 4Cl) supplemented with ampicillin 
(100 μg/mL) and gentamycin (100 μg/mL) and grown 
until saturation at 30°C with shaking. The saturated 
culture was then diluted 1:50 into 50 mL of M9 glycerol 
   | 5 of 14
ENGINEERED WASTEWATER BACTERIA DEGRADE PET
supplemented with ampicillin and gentamycin. Protein 
expression was induced with 0.2% arabinose, not 
induced, or repressed with 0.2% glucose when the 
OD600 of the culture reached 0.3–0.5, after which the 
cells were cultured for 12–14 h at 30°C with shaking 
(220 rpm). The supernatant for each culture was 
collected by centrifuging 50 mL of culture at 2550 × g 
for 60 min at 4°C and stored for the duration of the 
experiment at 4°C. A single pcPET disc was placed in 
a 2 mL polypropylene microcentrifuge tube with 2 mL 
of supernatant. A replicate tube was prepared without 
PET for comparison to account for any change in 
absorbance from other compounds. All samples were 
incubated at 50°C for 120 h. After incubation, samples 
were centrifuged at 14,000 × g for 3 min. The supernatant 
was transferred to a quartz cuvette, and absorbance 
at 240 nm was measured using UV-  spectrophotometry 
(Pirillo et al., 2021; Zhong- Johnson et al., 2021), where 
the spectrophotometer was blanked to 0.1 M KH2PO4- 
NaOH buffer (pH 8). The mean absorbance of samples 
without PET was subtracted from the absorbance 
reading of samples that contained PET.
For degradation of whole coffee cup lids, the lids 
were washed, dried and pre-  weighed using the same 
procedure described in the “ PET sample preparation ” 
section. The lids were submerged in individual sealed 
containers with 150 mL of 0.1 M KH2PO4- NaOH buffer 
(pH 8) containing 1:80 culture supernatant from isolate 
WW2. The reaction was carried out for 168 h at 50°C. 
The final mass of the lids was measured after washing 
and drying using the same procedure described in the 
“PET sample preparation” section.
Scanning electron microscopy
PET samples were washed with 1% SDS, 20% ethanol 
and distilled water, then dried overnight at 50°C. The 
samples were attached to an aluminium stub using 
double- sided carbon tape, followed by sputter-  coating 
(Polaron Instruments SEM Coating Unit E5100) with 
gold particles for 2 min at 20 mA in an argon atmosphere 
(layer thickness ~30 nm). The samples were then 
imaged by scanning electron microscopy (Tescan 
VEGA TS- 5130) at 20 kV and 1000× magnification.
Differential scanning calorimetry
PET film crystallinity was determined using differential 
scanning calorimetry. PET film samples (9–11 mg) were 
loaded into aluminum Tzero pans (TA Instruments, 
Grimsby, Ontario, Canada; product 901683.901) with a 
Tzero lid (TA Instruments; product 901671.901) for solid 
samples. Samples were heated from 40 to 300°C at 
10°C min−1, held at 300°C for 1 min, cooled from 300 
to 30°C at 10°C min−1 and held at 30°C for 1 min in a 
Q2000 calorimeter (TA Instruments) with an RCS90 
refrigerated cooling system. Percentage crystallinity 
was calculated as:
where ΔHf is the enthalpy of fusion at the melting point, 
ΔHc is the enthalpy of crystallisation and ΔHo
f  is the en-
thalpy of fusion for a completely crystalline sample at 
its equilibrium melting temperature, which is 140 J g−1 
(Mehta et al., 1978 ). TA Universal Analysis software 
was used to calculate ΔHf and ΔHc. ΔHf and ΔHc were 
measured by integrating from 110–120 to 150°C and 
210 to 260°C, respectively, with a linear baseline. 
Crystallinity was measured in triplicate for each source 
of PET.
Statistical analysis
Experiments were performed in biological and technical 
replicates where mentioned in figure captions. All 
statistical analyses were performed in Python 3.9 using 
the SciPy (Virtanen et al., 2020) library (v1.7.3). Welch's 
one- sided t- test was used to compare the means of 
two groups. p < 0.05 was considered as statistically 
significant.
RESULTS
pFAST- PETase- cis conjugates to bacteria 
from wastewater
We constructed an IncP RK2- based (Strand et al., 2014) 
conjugative plasmid, pFAST-  PETase- cis ( Figure 1A; 
Figure S1; Data S4 ), which carries the FAST-  PETase 
gene (Lu et al., 2022 ) under control of an arabinose- 
inducible promoter (P BAD) (details in “ Experimental 
Procedures” section). Our design of pFAST-  PETase- 
cis retains the signal peptide SP pstu and 6× His-  tag 
from the backbone pBTK522::FAST-  PETase (Lu 
et al., 2022 ; Figure 1B). These facilitate the secretion 
and purification of FAST-  PETase. We chose to drive 
FAST- PETase expression from the P BAD promoter 
to achieve tuneable gene expression for testing 
purposes. Moreover, this promoter has been shown to 
drive expression in a diverse range of gram-  negative 
bacteria (Prior et al., 2010). The plasmid carries a 
fluorescent marker ( mCherry) and two antibiotic 
resistance markers (Amp R, GmR) to facilitate selection 
and plasmid maintenance.
We used E. coli K- 12 ( ΔilvD::FRT, ΔgalK::cfp- bla, 
pSAS31, pTGD, pFAST-  PETase- cis) as conjugative 
donor. This strain is auxotrophic to isoleucine, leu -

minimal media (to facilitate isolation of transconju -
gants). Untreated wastewater influent was sourced 
from the City of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. This water 
source was chosen because wastewater influent is 
often a major source of microplastics that enter the 
environment through wastewater treatment plants (Liu 
et al., 2021; Sun et al., 2019 ). In addition, wastewater 
influent is representative of bacterial diversity inside 
wastewater treatment plants (Ye & Zhang, 2013 ). We 
filter- mated the donor strain with the wastewater sam -
ple and picked 32 transconjugant colonies expressing 
mCherry on M9 glucose agar plates supplemented 
with ampicillin and gentamycin ( Figure 1C, details in 
“Experimental Procedures ” section). No mCherry  ex-
pression was detected in a wastewater sample incu -
bated without donors ( Figure S2). Based on bacterial 
internal transcribed spacer (bITS) sequencing (Milani 
et al., 2020) on all 32 colonies in a pooled sample 
(performed by Metagenom Bio Life Science, details 
in Methods S1), we observed that most isolates were 
Gammaproteobacteria from the Enterobacteriaceae 
family (Data S1), with one exception: Pusillimonas ssp., 
a gram- negative bacterium from the Burkholderiaceae 
family. From these picked colonies, we selected seven 
isolates with distinct colony morphologies to iden -
tify using bITS sequencing on each individual colony 
(Table 1; Data S2) and to investigate for PET degrada-
tion activity.

ENGINEERED WASTEWATER BACTERIA DEGRADE PET
To confirm in situ delivery in wastewater conditions, 
we performed a liquid-  mating assay where donors 
were mixed directly into municipal wastewater influent 
samples (1× or 10× solids) and allowed to mate for 24 h 
(Figure 1D). After washing the mating mixture twice in 
1× PBS, the mixture was serially diluted and plated onto 
selective (ampicillin and gentamycin) and non- selective 
M9 glucose plates, which were incubated for 5 days at 
30°C. After counting colonies showing mCherry  activ-
ity, we found that the conjugation efficiency (defined as 
the ratio of transconjugants to transconjugants plus re -
cipients) was on the order of 1% (1.2% with 10× solids, 
1.9% with 1× solids). To confirm that observed colonies 
were not the donor strain, an exponentially growing 
donor culture was washed twice in 1× PBS and incu -
bated at 30°C for up to 7 days on selective M9 glucose 
plates; no growth was observed (Figure S3).
pFAST- PETase- cis is lost in absence of 
selection
To assess the stability of pFAST-  PETase- cis, we 
serially passaged four different transconjugant species 
once daily in LB media over the course of 14 days. The 
number of cells expressing ampicillin-  and gentamycin- 
resistance (which are carried on pFAST-  PETase- cis) 
decreased by 4–6 logs for WW2 ( Pusillimonas ssp.) 
and WW7 (Escherichia ssp.), whereas it decreased by 
about one log for WW17 (Enterobacter ssp.) and WW23 
(Citrobacter ssp.) (Figure 2). These results demonstrate 
that the plasmid is lost in the absence of selection, 
which highlights the need for additional measures to 
maintain the FAST- PETase gene in transconjugants.
Purified FAST- PETase expressed from 
transconjugant isolates degrades PET
Before beginning our activity assays, we used SDS- 
PAGE to characterise intracellular expression of 
FAST- PETase (Figure 3A). We then incubated com -
mercial, amorphous PET (aPET) film (crystallinity 
8.8 ± 1.0% determined by differential scanning calorim -
etry, “Experimental Procedures” section) with 3.6 μg of 
purified protein in 0.1 M KH 2PO4- NaOH (correspond-
ing to 200 nM FAST- PETase) from cell extracts. As a 
negative control, we incubated aPET film with the same 
buffer without FAST- PETase. Significant mass loss oc-
curred for several isolates (Figure 3C) in comparison to 
the negative control. We then characterised the pres -
ence of FAST- PETase in the supernatant by SDS- PAGE 
(Figure 3D) and incubated an aPET film with 3.6 μg of 
purified protein from culture supernatant. Again, sig -
nificant mass loss occurred ( Figure 3D) compared to 
the negative control. Inspection of aPET film samples 
with scanning electron microscopy (SEM) showed that 
samples treated with FAST-  PETase (Figure 3F) had a 
pitted surface, which is characteristic of enzymatic deg-
radation (Lu et al., 2022 ; Yoshida et al., 2016). In con -
trast, an untreated aPET sample had a smooth surface 
(Figure 3E).
Culture supernatant containing 
FAST- PETase degrades post- consumer 
PET without enzymatic purification
After confirming the effectiveness of FAST-  PETase 
isolated from transconjugants against commercial PET 
film, we next sought to confirm whether transconju -
gants could degrade PET without the need for enzy -
matic purification. FAST-  PETase has been previously 
demonstrated to be effective against numerous post- 
consumer PET (pcPET) products (Lu et al., 2022 ), so 
we switched to using post- consumer PET to simulate a 
source of PET that is more representative of PET waste 
encountered in the field. To test whether FAST- PETase 
produced from the isolates would degrade pcPET with-
out enzymatic purification, we incubated 6 mm hole 
punches of pcPET from a coffee cup lid (crystallin -
ity 11.4 ± 0.2% determined from differential scanning

calorimetry, “ Experimental Procedures ” section) with 
culture supernatant (M9 glycerol medium) from WW2 
(Pusillimonas ssp.), WW5 (Enterobacter ssp.) and WW7 
(Escherichia ssp.) that was diluted in 0.1 M KH 2PO4- 
NaOH buffer. We were unable to measure substantial 
mass loss within the accuracy of an analytical balance 
(accuracy of 0.1 mg; data not shown), so we measured 
degradation using a spectrophotometric technique 
(“Experimental Procedures ” section) instead, which is 
more sensitive than gravimetric measurements. The 
PET degradation byproducts, terephthalic acid (TPA) 
and mono- (2- hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (MHET), have 
both been shown to have an absorbance peak around 
240 nm (A240) (Zhong- Johnson et al., 2021).
In comparison to samples where FAST-  PETase ex-
pression was either repressed or not induced, a sig -
nificant increase in A 240 occurred in samples exposed 
to supernatant from cultures where FAST-  PETase 
expression was induced ( Figure 4A), indicating en -
zymatic degradation of the PET sample. Samples 
showing a significant increase in A 240 also showed 
signs of degradation observable with the naked eye 
(Figure 4B). Further inspection by SEM showed 
roughening of the plastic surface of PET samples 
incubated with cultures induced to express FAST-  
PETase (Figure 4B), which is characteristic of enzy -
matic degradation of PET (Lu et al., 2022 ; Yoshida 
et al., 2016).
We hypothesised that higher enzyme concentration 
in undiluted culture supernatant would improve the PET 
degradation rate. We thus followed the same protocol 
with culture supernatant that had not been diluted in 
KH2PO4- NaOH buffer. Contrary to our hypothesis, 
we observed minimal activity: there was little to no

increase in A240 relative to media where FAST- PETase 
expression was suppressed (Figure S4). We observed 
the same negative result when we repeated this exper-
iment with an additional pH adjustment step (addition 
of 1 M NaOH) to modify the pH of the supernatant from 
6.5 to 8.0, which is optimal for FAST-  PETase activity 
(Lu et al., 2022) (Figure S4).
We tested scaling of pcPET degradation by in -
creasing the total reaction volume, allowing an en -
tire coffee cup lid (same pcPET product used in 
Figure 4A) to incubate in diluted supernatant from 
WW2 (Pusillimonas  ssp.) for 168 h at 50°C. A lid that 
was incubated in supernatant where FAST-  PETase 
expression was induced showed signs of degradation 
visible to the naked eye ( Figure 4C) and significant 
mass loss (38 ± 9 mg, corresponding to 1.3 ± 0.3% of 
the initial mass of the lid; Figure  4D). In comparison, 
a lid incubated in supernatant where FAST-  PETase 
expression was suppressed did not show any visi -
ble signs of degradation ( Figure 4C) nor appreciable 
mass loss ( Figure 4D).
DISCUSSION
Engineering microbiomes to enable in situ degrada -
tion of plastics in diverse ecological niches remains 
a key milestone for deploying biological solutions for 
plastic waste at scale (Engineering Biology Research 
Consortium, 2022). Biotechnological plastic degrada -
tion and upcycling can offer a means to achieve a cir -
cular life cycle for plastic waste in a sustainable and 
cost- effective manner, facilitating a broader move to -
wards a circular economy. Developments in biotech -
nological approaches to plastic waste management 
will ideally complement related strategies for reduc -
tion of single-  use plastics and innovations in biode -
gradable plastics.
In this work, we demonstrated a proof of concept 
for genetically engineering bacteria from municipal 
wastewater in situ to degrade PET. We achieved this 
by using a broad-  host- range conjugative plasmid 
carrying the FAST-  PETase gene. Compared to cell 
bioaugmentation efforts, genetic bioaugmentation 
bypasses the adaptation barrier of introducing ex -
ogenous microbes into a new environment and thus 
could be used to achieve long-  term bioremediation 
solutions. In particular, an approach focused on deg -
radation of specific plastic compounds could be use -
ful for removing microplastics from the waste streams 
of plastic manufacturing and recycling facilities, which 
are a notable source of microplastic output into waste -
water (Brown et al., 2023 ).
The approach demonstrated here may generalise 
to a variety of ecological niches: several studies have

utilised the RK2/RP4 conjugation machinery cou -
pled with a broad-  host- range origin of replication (or 
a library of such origins) to engineer microbes from 
diverse environments: soil (Klümper et al., 2015 ), 
mammalian guts (Ronda et al., 2019 ) and marine eco -
systems (Goodman et al., 1993 ). A broad-  host- range 
genetic engineering platform could facilitate the con -
struction of microbial consortia for degradation of 
individual types of plastic polymers that have known 
biodegradation pathways (e.g. PET). Such libraries 
of consortia could eventually be further expanded for 
degradation of other common plastic polymers, po -
tentially resulting in modular tools for degradation of 
mixed- waste plastics.
Our results demonstrate that active FAST-  PETase 
released by the engineered isolates can degrade PET 
without the need for enzymatic purification ( Figure 4). 
The assays using purified enzyme ( Figure 3) illustrate 
the plastic-  degrading potential of the engineered iso -
lates, which can guide future optimisation efforts. 
However, we found that the solution conditions had a 
substantial effect on FAST-  PETase activity. Our pre -
liminary attempts to degrade commercial PET film in 
LB medium using a purified enzyme solution showed 
no activity (purified from WW5; data not shown). 
Furthermore, our attempts at degrading PET using 
untreated and pH-  adjusted supernatant also proved 
unsuccessful ( Figure S4), highlighting that further de -
velopments are necessary for effective in situ deg -
radation. It was necessary to dilute the supernatant 
to achieve significant PET degradation, consistent 
with previous observations that FAST-  PETase activ -
ity is inhibited at high enzyme concentrations (Avilan 
et al., 2023) and acidic conditions (Lu et al., 2022). 
We found that the secreted enzyme fraction per -
formed better than the intracellular enzyme fraction at 
similar dosages (e.g. WW5 and WW7 in Figure 3B,D), 
with a lower abundance of contaminating proteins in 
the purified secreted fraction compared to the intra -
cellular fraction ( Figure 3A,C), suggesting that the 
presence of other proteins in the medium may hin -
der FAST-  PETase activity. Improved activity could 
be achieved by a design in which expressed FAST-  
PETase is anchored to the cell surface; immobilising 
PETase enzymes has been shown to improve the sta -
bility and activity of the enzyme (Chen et al., 2020 ), 
including under simulated wastewater conditions 
(Zhu et al., 2022 ; Zurier & Goddard, 2022 ). Further 
optimisation of enzyme activity could be achieved by 
addressing environmental factors such as pH, tem -
perature and biotic factors such as other secreted en -
zymes and metabolic waste products.
Alongside improving operating conditions, PET 
degradation efficiency could be enhanced by improv -
ing the genetic vector design. In pFAST-  PETase- cis, 
FAST- PETase expression was regulated by the induc -
ible P BAD promoter for testing purposes. Regulating 
expression using a constitutive promoter could enable 
autonomous plastic degradation. Alternatively, expres -
sion induced by specific environmental conditions could 
be employed to minimise metabolic load and avoid un -
intended plastic degradation in, for example, products 
in use and infrastructure. Optimisation of ribosome- 
binding sites, transcriptional terminators and screening 
of signal peptides in members of the microbiome of in -
terest could likewise prove beneficial (Low et al., 2013; 
Xu et al., 2019).
To achieve complete conversion of PET to its con -
stituents, TPA and ethylene glycol (EG), the PETase 
activity investigated here could be complemented by a 
MHETase enzyme, which would enable conversion of 
the depolymerisation product, MHET, into TPA and EG; 
alternatively, MHETase might be present in the environ-
ment (produced by, e.g. I. sakaiensis  (Yoshida 
et al., 2016)). The turnover rate of wild-  type MHETase 
from I. sakaiensis  ( kcat ~ 25 s−1 at 30°C) (Knott 
et al., 2020) is much higher than that of FAST-  PETase 
(kcat ~ 0.016 s−1 at 50°C), 1 so depolymerisation by 
PETase will likely be the rate-  limiting step for the con -
version of PET into TPA and EG. Moreover, MHETase 
has been observed to improve PETase activity by re -
lieving product inhibition caused by MHET monomers 
(Erickson et al., 2022 ; Knott et al., 2020 ). Recently, a 
MHETase that is thermostable at the optimum operat -
ing temperature for FAST-  PETase has been designed 
(Zhang et al., 2023), offering an attractive dual- enzyme 
system for applications in PET biodegradation and up -
cycling. If production of large quantities of TPA and EG 
poses ecological or environmental concerns, bioaug -
mentation of additional consortia could be considered, 
using, for example the consortium designed by Bao 
et al. (2023) for efficient conversion of TPA and EG into 
biomass.
Using E. coli as a donor strain, we found that 
pFAST- PETase- cis could conjugate on a filter-  mating 
setup and in native wastewater conditions at effi -
ciencies high enough to allow isolation of transcon -
jugants by plating. Improvements in conjugation 
efficiency could be achieved by exploring alternative 
donor strains, conjugation systems and plasmid in -
compatibility classes; working towards applications, 
such efforts would need to account for environmental 
conditions (e.g. pH, temperature, seasonal variabil -
ity). Moreover, the concentration of suspended solids 
(not measured) could affect conjugation efficiency 
by increasing the total surface area available for at -
tachment, promoting spatial proximity between donor 
and recipient bacteria (Hamilton et al., 2019 ). We ob -
served low taxonomic diversity among the transcon -
jugant isolates, likely in part due to our reliance on 
mCherry  expression, driven by the P bs promoter 
 1Converted from the specific activity of 348 μmolTPAeq h−1 mgenzyme
−1 (Arnal 
et al., 2023).

whose activity has only been previously reported in 
Escherichia coli , Bacillus subtilis and Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae  (Yang et al., 2018). Moreover, it is possible 
that conjugation efficiency from E. coli is higher to -
wards closely related species (Stewart & Levin, 1977 ). 
Finally, the laboratory growth conditions likely had an 
impact on the results; reduced diversity of transconju -
gants has been reported in mating conditions that are 
less conducive to growth of diverse species (Ronda 
et al., 2019). Additional improvements for selection of 
the plasmid could be made by using a promoter li -
brary for selection markers and origins of replication 
(e.g. Ronda et al., 2019 ). Such efforts could target 
specific hosts that might be best suited to application 
(e.g. non- pathogenic strains known to be abundant in 
the conditions of interest).
We observed that pFAST-  PETase- cis was lost in 
the absence of selection to varying extents based on 
the host species ( Figure 2). This could be attributed to 
copy number variance arising from differences in host-  
encoded replication and regulatory proteins, plasmid 
oligomer formation in recombination-  proficient hosts, 
and differences in metabolic load (Summers, 1991 ). 
Nonetheless, our observations highlight that long-  term 
bioremediation applications will require efforts towards 
improving genetic stability. Improved maintenance of 
the function of interest could be achieved by incorpo -
rating plasmid maintenance systems such as toxin-  
antitoxin systems (Kroll et al., 2010 ; Lin et al., 2023 ), 
gene entanglement (Blazejewski et al., 2019 ; Chlebek 
et al., 2023) and plasmid partitioning systems (Danino 
et al., 2015) into the plasmid design, or by integrating the 
gene of interest into the chromosome of the host (Ronda 
et al., 2019). Chromosomal integration of the genetic 
cargo could be further constrained to non-  pathogenic 
species by using species-  and site- specific gene- editing 
tools (Rubin et al., 2022). Complementary selection ef-
forts may be required to ensure long- term in situ mainte-
nance of engineered strains (Raper et al., 2018).
Deployment of genetically engineered microorgan -
isms for degrading plastics will require careful consid -
eration of environmental and public safety and adhere 
to regional regulatory policies. To date, there have 
been few pilot-  scale or field studies utilising genetic 
bioaugmentation for bioremediation purposes (Ripp 
et al.,  2000 ; Sayler & Ripp, 2000; Venkata Mohan 
et al., 2009). One notable case was a field release in 
Estonia in 1989 of Pseudomonas putida cultures car -
rying a gene for metabolising phenol into a watershed 
contaminated from a phenol release caused by a subter-
ranean oil shale mine fire (Peters et al., 1997). Six years 
after the release, the introduced operon was still found 
to be present in native microbiota (Peters et al., 1997 ). 
This study suggests that an introduced functionality 
could persist long-  term in the environment if under se -
lection for metabolism of an abundant pollutant. It will 
be prudent to test the use of engineered microbes for 
plastic degradation in contained systems while simul -
taneously assessing ecological risk, including: char -
acterising the modified microorganisms and nature 
of the genetic modification, tracking the fate of these 
microorganisms and the introduced genes of interest, 
assessing the environmental impact of the release, and 
monitoring the effects of the release on non-  target mi-
croorganisms (Gustafsson & Jansson, 1993). Genetic 
biocontainment of the genetic vector using conditional 
lethality, conditional genetic regulation, and conditional 
fitness control could help prevent unintended escape 
of the modified microorganisms (Lee et al., 2018). In 
wastewater treatment plants, disinfection through ter -
tiary treatment operations could also offer an additional 
means of biocontainment. Moreover, the controlled 
environments in wastewater treatment units offer op -
portunities to assess ecological risks and explore the 
performance of in situ microplastic degradation at 
scale.
