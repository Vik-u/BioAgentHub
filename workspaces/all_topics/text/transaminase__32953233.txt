ABSTRACT: Transaminases are attractive catalysts for the production
of enantiopure amines. However, the poor stability of these enzymes
often limits their application in biocatalysis. Here, we used a framework
for enzyme stability engineering by computational library design
(FRESCO) to stabilize the homodimeric PLP fold type Iω-transaminase
from Pseudomonas jessenii . A large number of surface-located point
mutations and mutations predicted to stabilize the subunit interface were
examined. Experimental screening revealed that 10 surface mutations out
of 172 tested were indeed stabilizing (6% success), whereas testing 34
interface mutations gave 19 hits (56% success). Both the extent of
stabilization and the spatial distribution of stabilizing mutations showed
that the subunit interface was critical for stability. After mutations were
combined, 2 very stable variants with 4 and 6 mutations were obtained,
which in comparison to wild type (T
m
app =6 2°C) displayedTm
app values
of 80 and 85°C, respectively. These two variants were also 5-fold more active at their optimum temperatures and tolerated high
concentrations of isopropylamine and cosolvents. This allowed conversion of 100 mM acetophenone to (S)-1-phenylethylamine
(>99% enantiomeric excess) with high yield (92%, in comparison to 24% with the wild-type transaminase). Crystal structures mostly
conﬁrmed the expected structural changes and revealed that the most stabilizing mutation, I154V, featured a rarely described
stabilization mechanism: namely, removal of steric strain. The results show that computational interface redesign can be a rapid and
powerful strategy for transaminase stabilization.

■ INTRODUCTION
ω-Transaminases (ω-TAs) and amine transaminases (ATAs)
are highly attractive biocatalysts to synthesize optically pure
chiral amines, which are important intermediates in the
synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other ﬁne chemicals.1−3 In
the transaminase (TA) reaction, the pyridoxal 5′-phosphate
(PLP) cofactor of the enzyme serves as a molecular shuttle to
transfer an amino group from a donor (usually an amine or
amino acid) to an acceptor (a ketone, aldehyde, or keto acid)
(Scheme 1). The overall reaction consists of two parts, each
involving several chemical steps.4 In the ﬁrst half-reaction the
conserved lysine that forms a Schiﬀ base with the PLP cofactor
in the native protein (internal aldimine, E-PLP) is displaced by
the amino donor. This gives an external aldimine, and via
subsequent quinonoid and ketimine intermediates the amino
group of the donor is transferred to the PLP, yielding the
aminated pyridoxamine 5′-phosphate (PMP)−enzyme inter-
mediate (E:PMP). The deaminated donor is released as a
ketone, aldehyde, or keto acid. After this, in the second half-
reaction, the amino acceptor binds and reacts with the E:PMP
intermediate to form a ketimine, which subsequently

decomposes via a quinonoid and an external aldimine. Finally,
the enzyme’s lysine replaces the aminated acceptor, which is
released, and the E:PLP enzyme is re-formed.
TAs can also convert prochiral ketones or keto acids to the
corresponding amines with the nitrogen on a chiral carbon
atom. This enables the production of enantiopure compounds
by asymmetric catalysis if the reaction proceeds fast enough
with high product enantioselectivity. This requires not only
high enzyme activity but also enzyme robustness. Bioprocess
conditions that should be tolerated include high reactant
concentrations, the presence of cosolvents to increase reactant
solubility, high temperature to accelerate reaction rates, and
general stability to enable enzyme reuse.
5 Thus, to make TAs
more suitable for application, improving enzyme stability is of
key importance.
6
Many of the TAs with attractive activities for synthetic
applications are grouped as class III TAs in the PLP fold-type I
family of enzymes.
7 These mostly dimeric enzymes are
composed of identical subunits, and residues from both
subunits contribute to the identical active sites. The stability of
an enzyme of this class was recently improved by engineering
cofactor binding,
8 on the basis of the notion that the aminated
form of the cofactor PMP may be lost from the enzyme active
site, followed by irreversible denaturation.
9,10 As in other
enzymes, subunit dissociation may occur during inactivation.11
It likely triggers local unfolding and exposure of hydrophobic
patches which can aggregate, causing irreversible loss of
activity. Furthermore, subunit dissociation could expose the
hydrophilic PMP intermediate to solvent, causing cofactor loss.
This suggests that strengthening intersubunit interactions may
be used as a way to obtain more stable TAs. In agreement with
these observations, we were not very successful with initial
attempts to stabilize the TA used in this report by substituting
surface-located residues in ﬂexible regions identi ﬁed by
molecular dynamics simulations.
To test the hypothesis that interface mutations might
stabilize TA, we investigated the recently described class IIIω-
TA from Pseudomonas jessenii (PjTA), which exhibits low
stability even during storage at room temperature, and we
compared the eﬀect of surface-located mutations to mutations
at the subunits interface.PjTA is a homodimeric PLP fold-type
I enzyme with subunits of 456 amino acids.
12 The enzyme
catalyzes the deamination of 6-aminohexanoate, which is the
ﬁrst intermediate in the bacterial degradation of the industrial
nylon precursor caprolactam. The structures of the apoenzyme,
external aldimine with 6-aminohexanoate, and PMP-bound
enzyme were solved by protein crystallography.
12
In recent years, the power of structure-based enzyme
engineering has grown signiﬁcantly due to the development
of computer algorithms that can quantitatively predict the
stability eﬀects of mutations and designed sequences.
13−16
Using appropriate scoring functions, amino acid rotamer
libraries, and search algorithms toﬁnd low-energy solutions,
computational tools can search for potentially stabilizing
mutations within the vast sequence space accessible by random
mutagenesis.
17 For example, energy calculations with the
RosettaDesign program were used to identify three variants of
yeast cytosine deaminase, the apparent melting temperature
(T
m
app) of which was increased by 10°C.18 Another approach
focused on computational optimization of charge −charge
interactions on the protein surface, and this method was
successfully applied to increase theT
m
app of acylphosphatase
and of Cdc42 GTPase by 10 °C.19,20 Lee et al. increased
stability of β-glucosidase A by 16 °Ci n Tm
app by the
computational design of salt bridges.21 Positions for a disulﬁde
bond were identi ﬁed by MD simulation to improve the
stability of haloalkane dehalogenase. 22 A combination of
phylogenetic analysis for enzyme stabilization, usually called
the consensus approach,
23−25 and computational methods was
reported by Bednar et al. (FireProt)26 and Goldenzweig et al.
(PROSS).27 In this way, the thermostability of a dehalogenase
was increased by 24°C.26 Stabilization of tetrameric glucose
dehydrogenases by toward-consensus mutations at subunit
interfaces was reported by Vázquez-Figueroa et al.,
28 in one
case enhancingTm
app by up to 35°C, although most mutations
had a small eﬀect. Interface optimization through sequential
rounds of rational design was described by Bosshart et al.,29
increasing unfolding temperature of a homodimericD-tagatose
3-epimerase by 23°C.
Our group has explored a computational workﬂow called
FRESCO (framework for rapid enzyme stabilization by
computational libraries).
30 Brieﬂy, a large number of
potentially stabilizing mutations is predicted by folding energy
calculations and then all possible point mutations areﬁltered
by high-throughput molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and
visual inspection to construct a small library. Veri ﬁed
mutations are combined, giving large increases in stability.
This strategy has been applied to several enzymes:
30−37 e.g.,
the Tm
app of a monomeric haloalkane dehalogenase and a
peptide amidase was increased by 23°C with a 10% success
rate among the tested mutations.31,32
In this report, we examined the use of the FRESCO
workﬂow to improve the stability of PjTA. In view of the
dimeric structure and role of the PLP cofactor, we paid special
attention to mutations at the subunit interface, as stabilization
of multimeric enzymes may be achieved by preventing
dissociation.
11,28,29 In combination with phylogenetic data,
we predicted and experimentally conﬁrmed multiple stabilizing
mutations, mostly at the interface, which were combined to
obtain two robust variants. The stabilized PjTAs showed
higher activity at their new higher temperature optima,
enhanced cosolvent compatibility, and better isopropylamine
(IPA)-driven conversion of acetophenone to ( S)-1-phenyl-
ethylamine ((S)-1-PEA). The structural basis of the enhanced
stability was revealed by protein crystallography.
■ MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials. The chemicals sodium pyruvate, (S)-1-PEA, and
IPA were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. Acetophenone was
obtained from Acros Organics. PLP was purchased from Fisher
Scientiﬁc. The stain SYPRO Orange was purchased from Life
Technologies. Other chemicals were of analytical grade purity.
Computational Design of Stabilizing Mutations. To
design potentially stabilizing mutations inPjTA, we followed
the FRESCO protocol.
30,37 First, we calculated the eﬀects on
free energy of folding (ΔΔGfold) for point mutations at all
positions in the protein, substituting with all proteinogenic
amino acids except cysteine. The X-ray structures used were
PjTA-apo, the apoenzyme with phosphate bound (6G4C, 1.87
Å resolution with an R
free of 0.184); PjTA-as, the apoenzyme
with succinate bound (6G4B, resolution 1.80 Å,Rfree = 0.203),
and PjTA-plp, the PLP-bound enzyme (6G4D, 2.15 Å
resolution, Rfree = 0.261). For each point mutation, the
ΔΔGfold value was calculated using Rosetta38 with the Row 3
protocol (options: -ddg::local_opt_only true−ddg::opt_radius
8.0−ddg::weight_ ﬁle soft_rep_design -ddg::iterations 50-

ddg::min_cst false-ddg::mean true-ddg::min false-ddg::sc_mi-
n_only false-ddg::ramp_repulsive false). The same calculations
were performed with FoldX
39 using its standard settings. All
FoldX calculations were repeated ﬁve times to obtain better
averaging (Table S4). For both the FoldX and the Rosetta
protocol, the results over the three dimeric TA structures were
averaged.
To eliminate mutations that are unlikely to be stabilizing, we
used visual inspection of MD trajectories, which is a standard
part of the FRESCO procedure and described in detail
elsewhere.
37 For each mutant, a 3D structure was predicted by
FoldX using the crystal structure of the wild-typePjTA-plp as
the template. The modeled structure of each mutant was the
starting point forﬁve independent YASARA MD simulations40
of each 100 ps. The visual inspections, which were also
recently described in detail, result in the dismissal of mutations
causing solvent exposure of hydrophobic side chains,
introduction of unsatis ﬁed H-bond donors and acceptors,
increased ﬂexibility, and other structural problems. Scripts and
detailed protocols for the FRESCO procedure are available via
https://groups.google.com/forum/ #!forum/fresco-
stabilization-of-proteins. Using this procedure, a computation-
ally designed library of 226 variants was obtained for
experimental veriﬁcation.
For the consensus approach, homologues of PjTA were
searched using Blast and the nonredundant protein database at
the NCBI. In total 179 homologous protein sequences were
retrieved and used for multiple sequence alignment (MSA),
using ConSurf to calculate a consensus sequence.
41 For each
position in the sequence, the most abundant amino acid was
identiﬁed as the consensus amino acid. ThePjTA sequence
diﬀered at 91 positions from the consensus sequence. The
structures of all the individual back-to-consensus point
mutations were visually inspected as described above to
discard mutations with structural defects. This way, a small
library with 10 potentially stabilizing point mutations was
selected.
Several computational analyses were done independently
from the selection process of mutants for experimental
characterization. We examined the use of more stringent
energetic criteria for mutant selection, similar to the protocol
published by Bednar et al. under the acronym FireProt.
26 It
uses the same FoldX settings as FRESCO (see above) with the
Row 16 protocol of Rosetta. The prediction accuracy of the
computationally more expensive Row 16 protocol is
comparable to that of the Row 3 protocol used for FRESCO
(for a large benchmark set of mutations with knownΔΔG
fold
values the correlation coeﬃcient R was 0.68 for the Row 3
protocol and 0.69 for the Row 16 protocol).38 The settings for
this protocol were -ddg::weight_ﬁle soft_rep_design -ddg::it-
erations 20-ddg::local_opt_o nly false-ddg::min_cst true
-ddg::mean false -ddg::min tru e-ddg::sc_min_only false-
ddg::ramp_repulsive true. These settings diﬀer from the Row
3 protocol (shown above); the Row 16 protocol uses energy
minimization of the entire protein, while the Row 3 protocol
performs energy minimization only on amino acid side chains
that are within 8 Å of the mutated residue.
B-ﬁtter rankings of potential target positions inPjTA were
generated according to the manual provided by the Reetz
group ( http://www.kofo.mp g.de/en/research/
biocatalysis).
42,43 The B factors of all non-hydrogen atoms of
each residue were averaged for each position using the three
aforementioned X-ray structures. Positions with the highest
average B factor obtained the highest ranks.
To evaluate the existence of strain in the wild-typePjTA at
position Ile154, YASARA-St ructure molecular modeling
software was used.44 The highest resolution X-ray structure
of wild-type PjTA (6G4B) was taken. For both subunits,ﬁrst
the dihedral angle of interest (of Ile154 the following atoms: C,
Cα,C β, and Cγ1) was measured as well as the total van der
Waals (Lennard−Jones) energy and dihedral energy of the
protein. Subsequently, this dihedral was set to the nearest ideal
value (−60°), after which those energies were measured again.
The diﬀerence between both energies before and after setting
the dihedral was reported. The employed force- ﬁeld was
Amber14.
45 For the detection of strain eﬀects, the advantage of
the use of this forceﬁeld is that it has simple separate terms for
van der Waals (Lennard−Jones) and dihedral energies.
Genetic Engineering, Enzyme Expression, and Puri-
ﬁcation. The vector pET-20b (+)-His-PjTA, containing an in-
frame fusion of thePjTA gene with the ATG start codon, was
described in our previous work.12 Mutations of PjTA were
created by QuikChange site-directed mutagenesis. Primers
were designed by the QuikChange Primer Design Program of
Agilent Technologies. The mutations were veriﬁed by DNA
sequencing (Euroﬁns Genomics). For library screening, we
used small-scale enzyme production. Con ﬁrmed mutated
plasmids were transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) for
expression. Single colonies were picked and grown overnight
in 96-deep-well plates. Next, the cultures were transferred to
24-deep-well plates containing Terriﬁc Broth (TB) medium
with 100μg/mL ampicillin and growth was continued at 37°C
until the OD
600 value reached 0.6. Then the cultures were
cooled to 24°C and IPTG was added to a concentration of 1
mM. After further growth at 24°C for 16 h, the cells were
harvested by centrifugation at 3000g for 30 min and the pellets
were washed and suspended with lysozyme solution (1 mg/mL
lysozyme, 0.5 mg/mL DNase, 10 mM MgCl
2, 20 mM Tris-
HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 20μM PLP, pH 7.5). The suspensions
were kept at−80 °C for 45 min and thawed under tap water to
disrupt the cells. The plates were centrifuged at 3000g for 45
min at 4 °C, and some of the supernatant was used to
determine enzyme production by SDS-PAGE. The remainder
of the supernatants was loaded on AcroWell 96-well ﬁlter
plates (Pall, USA) containing TALON metal a ﬃnity
chromatography resin (Clontech, USA). Elution was con-
ducted with buﬀer containing 20 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM
NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, and 20 μM PLP, pH 7.5. The
desalting step was done with a multiwell gravity column PD
MultiTrap G-25 (GE, U.K.) to remove imidazole. Enzymes
were stored in buﬀer (50 mM potassium phosphate, pH 8.0) at
−20 °C until use.
Selected promising variants were expressed and puriﬁed on a
larger scale. After inoculation and overnight growth of
precultures, the cells were transferred to 500 mL of TB
medium (100 μg/mL ampicillin) and cultures were shaken at
37 °C. When the OD
600 value reached 0.6, the temperature was
lowered to 24°C, and induction was started by addition of 1
mM of IPTG. After 16 h of growth the cells were collected at
7000g for 30 min and the pellets were washed and suspended
in buﬀer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 20μM PLP, pH
7.5). After sonication (15 min, 5 s intervals), the lysate was
centrifuged at 36000g for 45 min at 4°C. The supernatant was
loaded onto a 5 mL HisTrap column (GE Healthcare,
Sweden) and the enzyme was isolated with an AKTA puriﬁer

using a linear gradient of 0 to 500 mM imidazole in buﬀer.
Fractions containing the enzyme as judged by SDS-PAGE were
pooled and desalted in phosphate buﬀer (50 mM potassium
phosphate, pH 8.0) with Econo-Pac 10DG columns (Bio-Rad,
USA). The purity was checked by SDS-PAGE, and the protein
was quantiﬁed with the Bradford assay. Puriﬁed enzymes were
stored in aliquots at−80 °C in 50 mM potassium phosphate,
pH 8.0.
Thermal Shift Assays. T

app values were determined by
the ﬂuorescence-based Thermoﬂuor assay.46 Speciﬁcally, 5 μL
of 50-fold diluted SYPRO orange and 20μL of 0.5 mg/mL
enzyme solution were placed in an IQ 96-well PCR plate (Bio-
Rad, USA) and mixed thoroughly in the wells. The plates were
sealed with Microseal B adhesive sealer (Bio-Rad, USA) and
heated from 20 to 99°C in a MyiQ real-time PCR machine
(Bio-Rad, USA) with a linear gradient of increasing temper-
ature (1 °C/min). The temperature at the maximum rate of
ﬂuorescence change (dRFU/dT) was taken asT

Activity Assays and (S)-1-PEA Synthesis. TA activities
were measured by following the formation of acetophenone
from (S)-1-PEA at 37°C in 96-well MTP format. The reaction
mixtures contained the substrates (S)-1-PEA and pyruvate at
varying concentrations, 0.05 mM PLP, and 0.02 mg/mL of
puriﬁed enzyme in 50 mM potassium phosphate buﬀer, pH
8.0. The formation of acetophenone was detected at 245 nm
(extinction coeﬃcient 12 mM
−1 cm−1).48
The synthesis of ( S)-1-PEA from acetophenone was
conducted at a concentration of 1 M IPA as amino donor
and 20 or 100 mM acetophenone in 50 mM potassium
phosphate, pH 8.0, containing 20% DMSO, 0.5 mM PLP, and
1 mg/mL of enzyme. Reactions were done at the enzyme’s
temperature optimum. The formation of ( S)-1-PEA was
measured by HPLC. Samples from reaction mixtures with
enzymes were quenched by adding half a volume of 10%
perchloric acid to samples taken at diﬀerent reaction times, and
precipitates were removed by centrifugation. Next, 200μLo f
the supernatant of each sample was transferred to an HPLC
vial for analysis. The formation of (S)-1-PEA was analyzed
using a Crownpack CR (+) column (Daicel, Japan) with 0.6
mL/min perchloric acid (pH 1.5) for elution and detection at
210 nm.
49 Under these conditions, (S)-1-PEA eluted at 21 min
with clear separation from (R)-1-PEA (27 min).
Crystal Structures.PjTA variants R4 and R6 were further
puriﬁed by size exclusion chromatography using a Super-
dex200 10/300 column (GE Healthcare, Sweden), equilibrated
with 20 mM HEPES, pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 20μM PLP.
The puriﬁed enzymes were concentrated to∼10 mg/mL using
a Vivaspin Turbo 4 10Kﬁlter unit (Sartorius). Hanging drop
vapor diﬀusion experiments were set up in 24-well LINBRO
plates (Molecular Dimensions Ltd.) by mixing 1 μL of the
protein solution with 1μL of the reservoir solution containing
0.7−1.0 M sodium succinate, pH 7.6, similarly as used
previously for crystallizing the wild-typePjTA.
12 Single PjTA
R4 crystals appeared after 2 days and grew to an average size of
0.3 × 0.3 × 0.2 mm
3. Their yellow color indicated that PLP
was bound. Large single yellow crystals were also obtained for
R6 (average size 0.5× 0.4 × 0.2 mm
3) but required a lower
protein concentration of 5 mg/mL. Prior to data collection,
crystals were soaked in a cryoprotectant solution containing
1.2 M succinate, pH 7.6, 0.1 mM PLP, and 30% glycerol. X-ray
diﬀraction data for R4 were collected in house using Cu Kα
radiation from a Bruker Microstar rotating-anode generator
equipped with Helios MX mirrors. For R6, X-ray diﬀraction
data were collected at beamline ID30A-3 at the European
Synchrotron Radiation Facility (Grenoble, France). The
diﬀraction data for R4 and R6 were indexed and integrated
using iMOSFLM
50 and XDS,51 respectively, and then scaled
and merged using Aimless52 from the CCP4 software suite.53
The crystals of R4 and R6 belonged to the same space group as
for wild-type PjTA, with nearly identical unit cell dimensions,
allowing the wild-type crystal structure (PDB entry 6G4B) to
be directly used for initial reﬁnement and electron-density map
calculations. Subsequently, the structures were adjusted by
model building to replace the side chains of the mutated
residues. A few cycles of re ﬁnement using RefMac5,
54
alternated with model building and water placement using
Coot,55 were suﬃcient to complete the structures. A summary
of data collection and model reﬁnement statistics is provided in
Table S1. Figures were produced with PyMol.56
■ RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Computational Library Design.In view of the instability
of dimeric class III TAs 9 and the importance of enzyme
robustness for biocatalytic applications, we investigated the
possibility to enhance the stability of the homodimericPjTA
by protein engineering. For this we chose the FRESCO
workﬂow, which was used earlier by us and others to increase
the thermostability of dimeric limonene epoxide hydrolase
(ΔT
m
app =3 5 °C),30 monomeric haloalkane dehalogenase
(ΔTm
app =2 3 °C),31 monomeric peptide amidase (ΔTm
app =
23 °C),32 monomeric xylanase ( ΔTm
app =1 4 °C),33
monomeric HMF oxidase (ΔTm
app =1 1 °C),34 monomeric
cyclohexanone monooxygenase (ΔTm
app =1 3 °C),35 and a
tetrameric halohydrin dehalogenase (ΔTm
app =2 8°C).36 First,
all possible point mutations were subjected to folding energy
calculations. FoldX and Rosetta predicted 385 and 883
potentially stabilizing point mutations (ΔΔG
fold < −2.5 kJ/
(mol subunit)), respectively, with some overlap. To further
computationally enrich this virtual library, all 1028 diﬀerent
mutants substituted at 222 diﬀerent positions were subjected
to MD simulations and brief on-screen inspection. Discarding
mutants with structural defects or increased local ﬂexibility
yielded a reduced virtual library of 226 point mutations at 114
diﬀerent positions which qualiﬁed for experimental testing.
This set included 20 buried mutations, 172 surface mutations,
32 interface mutations, and 2 mutations located at both the
surface and the interface (Table S2).
After multiwell plate format QuikChange mutagenesis and
transformation to E. coli BL21(DE3), 204 of the 226
sequenced mutants gave expression of enzyme in soluble
form as shown by SDS-PAGE. For the 22 other sequence-
veriﬁed variants, the gels showed that no target protein was
produced and also no signal was found in Thermoﬂuor assays
after His-tag puri ﬁcation in multiwell format. We initially
tested a set of surface-located mutations, hoping toﬁnd useful
variants, but the stabilizing eﬀect was small. When all 204
expressed mutants were tested, 29 signiﬁcantly stabilizing point
mutations were discovered in Thermoﬂuor assays (ΔT
m
app ≥
+1 °C, from triplicate assays) and these were distributed over
16 diﬀerent positions (Table 1). Of the conﬁrmed stabilizing
mutations, 17 were located at the subunit interface and 10
mutations were located at the surface; 2 additional mutations
(E74I and N78K) were located at the border of the surface and
the interface. These numbers show that of the 172 predicted
surface mutations that were not at the interface, only 6% were
stabilizing, whereas of the selected 34 interface mutations, 56%

improved thermostability. Moreover, the degree of stabilization
by surface mutations was modest (+1°C ≤ ΔTm
app <+ 3°C),
except for mutation E74I (+5.5°C), which is partially at the
interface. The interface mutations caused a much larger
increase in stability, with 74% of the interface-located
stabilizing mutations giving ΔT
m
app ≥ +3 °C( Figure 1).
Thus, interface point mutations stabilizedPjTA much better
than surface mutations, which conﬁrms the hypothesis that
subunit interactions are crucial to TA stability.
These results indicate that mutations stabilizing the interface
can be rapidly discovered by computational design. The high
abundance (56%) of experimentally con ﬁrmed stabilizing
mutations in a small set of only 34 interface mutants suggests
that, for proteins where stability is due to subunit dissociation,
it is possible to strongly reduce the library size for experimental
testing in comparison to usual random directed evolution
protocols. The high success rate also compares favorably to
that of FRESCO mutations which are selected without
focusing on suspected sensitive regions (success percentages
of ca. 10−20% for 8 diﬀerent proteins including the current
target (Table S3)). This suggests that focusing on sensitive
regions in computational thermostability engineering can
strongly reduce laboratory screening.
For PjTA it transpires that the interface is far more relevant
for stabilization than other areas and the most stabilizing
mutation G98M (+4°C) ofω-TA fromVariovorax paradoxus
was also at the interface.
57 However, this is not a general
phenomenon for multimeric enzymes. For example, for a
tetrameric halohydrin dehalogenase two critical regions were
observed.
36 One of these critical regions was indeed at a
subunit interface, but the other equally important region was at
the surface. In a dimeric limonene epoxide hydrolase that was
also targeted by FRESCO, several of the most stabilizing
mutations were also not at the interface.
30 Focusing exclusively
on the subunit interfaces in those enzymes would have missed
many strongly stabilizing mutations.
With other methods, it also remains challenging to predict
the region that is critical for thermostability. A well-known
approach is theB-ﬁtter method, which predicts critical residues
on the basis of high B factors.
42,43 However, in the case of
PjTA, only 1 out of the 16 positions where stabilizing
mutations were observed showed a signiﬁcantly high B factor
in the wild-type crystal structures (Table S2). Thus, most of
these mutations would escape discovery by the B-ﬁtter
approach for stability engineering. After averaging and ranking
of B factors in the wild-type crystal structures, only E38K/Q
(T
m
app = 1.5/2.0 °C) had a high ranking according to itsB
factor (rank 25). All other stabilizing residues with the highest
B factor appeared after the 30th rank, which is outside the
proposed threshold.
43 Nevertheless, focusing on highB factor
regions did yield mutations that improve the stability of
Chromobacterium violaceumTA (CvTA).
58 For the one enzyme
that has been improved both by FRESCO and by theB-ﬁtter
approach (halohydrin dehalogenase), the two approaches
found diﬀerent stabilizing mutations,
36,59 indicating that they
may be complementary.
Unlike in earlier work with FRESCO, we averaged the
results of the FoldX and Rosetta calculations obtained with
three diﬀerent X-ray structures instead of taking results from a

single structure. A retrospective analysis showed that 3 out of
the 31 stabilizing mutations could have been missed if only a
single input structure were used: I154D with 6G4B and P9A
and P139K with 6G4C. These substitutions just fail the chosen
threshold of−2.5 kJ/(mol subunit) for experimental character-
ization (Table S4). Template selection and averaging can
inﬂuence calculated ΔΔGfold values and mutant selection,
although the eﬀect was small in this case.
Another approach to reduce the number of computationally
designed mutations that need to be screened experimentally is
the use of stricter criteria for predictedΔΔGfold values, as in
the Fireprot protocol.26 Our standard protocol usesΔΔGfold ≤
−2.5 kJ mol−1 per subunit for both FoldX and Rosetta. When
only mutations were accepted withΔΔGfold ≤− 4.184 kJ mol−1
for FoldX and ΔΔGfold ≤− 8.368 kJ mol −1 for Rosetta
(FireProt criteria), only 28 instead of 226 mutations would
qualify for experimental testing. Of those 28, 5 were indeed
stabilizing (Table S2). The stricter energy criteria only slightly
improved the fraction of successful mutations (from 14 to
17%), and the smaller set of 28 still included mutations that
decrease thermostability. It should be noted that FoldX and
Rosetta predict ΔΔG
fold at ambient temperature and not
ΔTm
app, which is far more diﬃcult to model and is not strongly
correlated to ΔΔGfold.
We also explored the use of consensus mutations to stabilize
PjTA. First, we used Blast searches to ﬁnd homologues of
PjTA in the nonredundant protein database of the NCBI, and
179 diﬀerent sequences were chosen. A consensus sequence,
obtained by ConSurf,41 diﬀered from PjTA at 91 positions.
After point mutants with structural defects were discarded by
visual inspection, a small library containing 10 potentially
stabilized mutants was constructed and their stabilities were
measured in the laboratory (Table S5). This yielded three
conﬁrmed stabilizing mutations (all withΔT
m
app ≥ +1 °C; see
Table 1), one of which was at the surface and two were at the
interface. The interface mutation I154V is one of only two
mutations shared between the FRESCO library and the
consensus set, and with +9°C it gave the largestΔTm
app value.
Other stabilizing mutations are not shared, and about half of
the mutations found by FRESCO are neither at positions that
are strongly conserved among a set of 226 homologous TAs
nor at positions wherePjTA deviates from strongly conserved
residues in the consensus sequence, as indicated by ConSurf
calculations (Figure S5). The results of comparing diﬀerent
strategies for enzyme stabilization will be strongly dependent
on the way strategies are implemented and on the particular
system under investigation. In the case of TAs we expect that
the structure-based design of small libraries focusing on

app values and catalytic activities ofPjTA variants containing interface-stabilizing mutations. Activities were determined by measuring
acetophenone formation from (S)-1-PEA with pyruvate as the amino acceptor (seeMaterials and Methods). WT had an activity of 13 U/mg (1 U

mutations that stabilize the interface will be particularly
eﬀective.
Since most of the eﬀective mutations are at the subunit
interface and are close to the active site, there was a risk that
they reduce activity or show antagonistic eﬀects. When the
eﬀect of the individual stabilizing interface mutations on
catalytic activity at 37°C was examined, it appeared that most
of them indeed gave somewhat lower activity in comparison to
wild-type PjTA ( Figure 2 ). Gratifyingly, we also found
interface mutations that strongly enhanced catalytic activity:
i.e., K89F, S87N, M128F, L319F and I154V (Figure 2). I154V
was especially eﬀective, as it increased the activity by a factor of
3.5 and had a large positive eﬀect on T
m
app. Stabilizing the
subunit interface not only increased stability but could also
improve activity.
Combining Stabilizing Mutations.In order to engineer
a highly stable PjTA, we rationally combined con ﬁrmed
stabilizing mutations. Some interface mutations that enhanced
stability but lowered activity were included, since it was
considered that the activity could be recovered when
mutations were combined. In the case of diﬀerent stabilizing
mutations at the same position, the mutation giving the most
favorable eﬀect onΔT
m
app was selected. For example, mutation
I154V, which gave +9 °C and 3.5-fold greater activity, was
prioritized over I154N and I154D ( Figure 2). The I154V
mutation was included in all combination mutants. For
position Ser87, variant S87D gave the bestΔT
m
app value (+7
°C) and S87N was the best for activity (1.2-fold increase);
therefore, both were examined in combinations. Finally, nine
interface stabilizing mutations, eight surface mutations, and
two mutations that were partially at the interface were selected
for combination.
On examination ofPjTA variants carrying diﬀerent pairs of
stabilizing mutations, it a ppeared that most mutations
combined well with I154V, yielding several double mutants
with ΔT
m
app value of +9 to +17 °C, with the exception of
I154V + S110Q, which only displayed a 2°C increase (Figure
3). In addition, activities improved by up to 5.4-fold over wild-
type PjTA. The only less active double mutant was I154V +F
86W (Figure 3). After it was shown that this combination
strategy is feasible, 8 double mutants with decent activity and
improved stability (I154V + E38Q, I154V + S87N, I154V +
A60V, I154V + P9A, I154V + K89F, I154V + S87D, I154V +
M128F and I154V + F86W) were selected as templates for
introducing further mutations, resulting in triple mutants, 4-
fold mutants, 5-fold mutants, and 6-fold mutants (Figures S1−
S4). This yielded 27 diﬀerent mutants with improved activity
and stability.
From the set of combination mutants, six variants each with
four to six mutations were selected for temperature−activity
proﬁling, since it was considered possible that activity in some
variants would be lower at the standard assay temperature of
37 °C but would improve at higher temperatures. For all six
variants, the optimum temperature was increased, reaching
values of 60−70 °C for some mutants, about 20−30 °C higher
than the wild-type PjTA optimum temperature (37 °C)
(Figure 4). The activities at the new optimal temperatures of
the robust mutants R4 (P9A + E38Q + S87D + I154V), R5
(P9A + E38Q + A60V + S87D + I154V) and R6 (P9A + E38Q
+ A60V + S87N + M128F + I154V) were up to 5-fold higher
than the wild-type activity at 37°C( Table 2). There was a 6.8-
fold diﬀerence in activity at 37°C between mutants R4 and
R6, while their activities were almost the same at their
respective optimum temperatures, pointing to quite diﬀerent
temperature dependences. Furthermore, the individual muta-
tions of these two variants clearly showed additive eﬀects on
ΔT
m
app when they were combined. Therefore, these two robust
PjTA variants R4 and R6 were selected for further study
(Table 2).
The Tm
app values of R4 and R6 (80 and 85°C measured by
thermal shift assays) are in the range of values (Tm
app >8 0°C)
observed for enzymes from thermophilic organisms. 60 The
impressive thermostability of the combination mutants and
prominence of stabilizing interface mutations suggest that
subunit dissociation is an important step in the irreversible
inactivation pathway.
29 It has been proposed by Börner et al.9
for three diﬀerent TAs that dissociation from the enzyme of
the aminated cofactor PMP formed in theﬁrst half reaction
(Scheme 1) is a key step in activity loss, and strengthening of
cofactor binding indeed enhanced stability.8 In PjTA, loss of
the PLP or PMP cofactor will require dissociation of the dimer
or partial protein unfolding, since the cofactor is buried
between the two monomers and the phosphate group of each
cofactor is bound by both subunits (Figure S6). Enhanced
cofactor binding and increasing dimer stability are compatible
mechanisms.
Stabilized PjTAs Have Higher Activity, Thermo-
stability, and Cosolvent Resistance.The catalytic proper-
ties of R4 and R6 were determined by initial rate assays in
which (S)-1-PEA was used as the amino donor and pyruvate as
the amino acceptor (Table 3). With these substrates, both
stabilized variants showed a 4−5-fold higher k
cat value than
wild-type PjTA at their optimum temperatures, while theKM
values for ( S)-1-PEA and pyruvate were both slightly
increased. The kcat/KM values at their optimum temperatures
were improved in comparison to wild-typePjTA, for both the
amino donor and acceptor. With a higherkcat and lower KM,
variant R6 was slightly better for (S)-1-PEA conversion than
R4.
To further examine the robustness of the selected mutants,
the stabilities at high temperature were measured. The
enzymes were incubated at di ﬀerent temperatures (30 −80
°C) for 2 h. After they were cooled for 5 min at 4°C, samples
were withdrawn for activity assays at their optimum temper-
atures. From 30 to 40°C, no diﬀerence in stability was found
between wild-typePjTA and mutants (Figure 5). Interestingly,
during incubation at 30 °C for 2 h, the activities of both
mutants increased, which may be due to enzyme refolding.
Above 40 °C both the R4 and R6 variants were more stable
than wild-type PjTA, and the activities of the mutants only
dropped slightly until 70 °C. For the wild-type PjTA, no

activity was found with enzyme incubated at 60°C or higher.
Mutant R6 was always slightly more stable than R4. The
increased stability observed in these thermal shock assays for
R4 and R6 correlated with the enhancedTm
app values obtained
from thermal shift assays (Table 3).
Another important aspect of enzyme robustness is stability
in the presence of organic solvents. Two often-used organic
solvents were examined, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and
methanol. The variants R4 and R6 were incubated with 20%
cosolvent at 30°C. After 2 h, samples were withdrawn to assay
for ( S)-1-PEA deamination at the respective optimum
temperatures in buﬀer without additional solvent. We found
almost no activity loss with the stable variants (Figure 6A). In
contrast, the wild-typePjTA activity dropped by approximately
48% and 20% after 2 h incubation with 20% DMSO and 20%
methanol, respectively.
In view of the robustness of R4 and R6 in DMSO and
methanol, deamination reactions were also conducted in the
presence of 20% cosolvent. Both R4 and R6 were much more
active than wild-typePjTA, the highest activity being observed
for R6 (Figure 6B). We also found that methanol is a more
suitable cosolvent for deamination reactions in comparison to
DMSO, for both variants as well as for wild-typePjTA.

The stability increases makePjTA a highly robust enzyme,
also in comparison with the well-studied dimericω-TAs from
C. violaceum (CvTA) and Vibrio ﬂuvialis (Vf TA). Whereas
wild-type PjTA seems more unstable than some of its
homologues, the R4 and R6 mutants ofPjTA have surpassed
other ω-TAs in stability. Engineered homotetramericPseudo-
monas sp. ω-TA, investigated by Börner et al.,9 still had lost
activity after a 2 h incubation at 62°C, while R4 and R6 were
still active (Figure 5). Similarly, no activity loss was found for
R4 and R6 upon incubation for 2 h in 20% DMSO or 20%
methanol ( Figure 6 A), whereas thermostable ω-TA from
Thermomicrobium roseum (ω-TATR) retained only about 50%
or 75% activity, respectively.60
Increased IPA Tolerance in Amine Synthesis.In view
of the stability of R4 and R6, we also examined the tolerance to
a high concentration of IPA, a preferred cheap amino donor for
ω-TA-catalyzed reactions.61,62 Tolerance is important because
IPA needs to be used in excess over the acceptor for the
eﬃcient production of amines, especially in case of unfavorable
reaction equilibria. To determine the tolerance of the R4 and
R6 variants, reactions were done with an IPA concentration of
1 M, which is 50-fold higher than the concentration of the
amino acceptor acetophenone. After 20 h of incubation at each
optimum temperature, the conversions of acetophenone to
(S)-1-PEA were 84% and 93% for R4 and R6, respectively, in
comparison to 35% conversion with the wild-type PjTA
(Figure 7A). The initial rates were higher for the mutants, in
the case of both R4 (60μM/min) and R6 (63μM/min), in
comparison to wild-type PjTA (20 μM/min). Thus, the two
robust mutants accepted IPA better as an amino donor and
gave a 2.5-fold increase in yield. The enantioselectivities were
not changed (ee >99%, for both wild-typePjTA and the two
variants). Mutants of a TA fromRuegeria sp. TM1040 (PDB:
3FCR) that show very good conversion of acetophenone and
2-bromoacetophenone were reported by Dawood et al.
63 In
that case, three to four mutations were introduced in the active
site to enhance activity in reactions with IPA as the amino
donor. The improvement may be related to better acceptance
of the ketone substrate, reducing the lifetime of the vulnerable
PMP-enzyme intermediate in the catalytic cycle. Reduced
dissociation of the PMP-enzyme was also proposed for the
transaminase mutants engineered by Börner et al.
8,9 Thus,
three ways of improving TAs for better ketone or aldehyde to
amine conversion with IPA as amine donor emerge: reducing
dissociation of the native enzyme assembly into subunits,
enhancing binding of the PLP cofactor, and improving the
binding and reaction of the ketone or aldehyde amine acceptor.
To further verify the robustness of R4 and R6, the amination
reaction was also conducted with cosolvents. In the reaction,
the amino donor IPA was kept at 1 M and 100 mM
acetophenone substrate was dissolved with 20% DMSO. After
a 20 h reaction time, the conversions of acetophenone to (S)-
1-PEA were 75% and 92% for R4 and R6, respectively, in
comparison to 24% conversion with the wild-type PjTA
(Figure 7B). Thus, the performance of two robust variants was
indeed better with cosolvents. Especially for R6, the fraction of
conversion remained the same even though the substrate
concentration was 5-fold higher.
Crystal Structures of Robust PjTA Variants. To
understand the structural basis of the enhanced thermostability
and to assess the reliability of the computational prediction
methods, structures were determined for the R4 and R6
variants. The crystal structures were re ﬁned to 1.95 Å
resolution with an R factor of 0.139 (R
free = 0.172) for R4
and to 1.85 Å resolution with anR factor of 0.144 (Rfree =
0.173) for R6. Both crystal structures contain the PLP cofactor
as an internal aldimine, covalently linked to Lys287. They have
good stereochemistry, and no signi ﬁcant di ﬀerences were
observed in overall backbone conformation between the wild-
type and mutant PjTA structures. All mutated residues
displayed well-deﬁned electron density, allowing unambiguous
assignment of their side-chain conformations and a clear
analysis of interactions with neighboring residues.
Mutation P9A, present in both variants, is located at the N-
terminus of a shortα-helix (Figure 8A,B). The experimental
and predicted structures for this mutation are in excellent
agreement, revealing no signiﬁcant diﬀerences in local protein
structure. The mutation occurs at the second residue
composing the α-helix (α1), located at the N-terminus of
the protein. The hydrophobic side chain of Pro9 is fully
exposed to solvent, and its substitution with a small methyl
group is expected to improve protein surface solvation.
Furthermore, unlike the amide group of Pro9, the backbone
amide group of Ala9 is able to form a hydrogen bond with
water, as is evident from the crystal structures of R4 and R6.
Thus, the improvement in stability of the P9A mutation is
explained by a combination of reduced exposed hydrophobic
surface and improved protein−water interactions.
Mutation E38Q also occurs at the protein surface. In the
crystal structures of the mutants, residue Gln38 adopts a side
chain rotamer diﬀerent from that predicted (Figure 8C,D), but
Figure 7. Conversion of acetophenone to (S)-1-PEA by WT and the two robust variants R4 and R6. In all cases, the concentration of the IPA
amino donor was 1 M, the PLP concentration was 0.5 mM, and enzymes were added at 1 mg/mL. The reactions were measured at the optimum
temperature of each individual variant. (A) Initial concentration of acetophenone 20 mM. (B) Initial concentration of acetophenone 100 mM with

in both conformations the side chain forms a hydrogen bond
with the hydroxyl group of Tyr43. In the wild-type crystal
structure, residue Glu38 due to a salt bridge with Arg36 does
not form hydrogen bonds with neighboring residues, so that
the enhancement in stability can partially be explained by
improved hydrogen-bonding interactions on the surface. In
addition, the removal of the negative charge by the E38Q
mutation reduces unfavorable electrostatic interactions on the
protein surface (Figure 8E), which may also contribute to
better protein stability.

Mutation A60V was obtained by the consensus approach. In
comparison to the alanine residue in the wild-type structure,
Val60 in the R6 crystal structure forms additional apolar van
der Waals contacts with the side chains of Phe64 and Phe82′;
the latter are not present in the wild type. The stabilizing eﬀect
of the mutation can thus be attributed to improved
hydrophobic packing interactions of side chains at or near
the dimer interface.
For mutation M128F, occurring only in R6, the experimental
and predicted structures are in excellent agreement. The
improvement in stability is clearly related to the new T-shaped
π−π interaction between Phe128 and Phe113 (Figure 9A).
The contribution to stability of the Ser87 mutants (S87D in
R4, S87N in R6) is related to improved contacts at the dimer
interface. In the R4 crystal structure, the side chain of Asp87
shows alternate conformations. In one of the conformations
the carboxylate forms a salt bridge with Arg417′, similar to the
salt bridge in the predicted structure of the S87D mutant
(Figure 9B). The formation of a salt bridge at the dimer
interface is consistent with the signiﬁcant increase inT
m
app for
this mutation. Also, Asn87 in the R6 crystal structure interacts
with Arg417′, but via a hydrogen bond (Figure 9C), which is
normally a weaker interaction, consistent with the smaller
increase inT
m
app for mutation S87N. In the predicted structure
containing the S87N mutation, the side chain of Arg417 ′
points away from Asn87 toward the active site. In this
conﬁguration the Arg417′ guanidinium group is exposed to
solvent. This indicates that the small improvement in stability
for S87N could also be due to improved solvation of the
Arg417′ side chain. Diﬀerences in interactions of Arg417′ may
also explain the opposite eﬀects on activity observed for the

two mutations. The arginine is strictly conserved inω-TAs and
plays an important role in catalysis by a conformational change
called an arginine switch, which enables dual substrate
recognition.
64 During conversion of ( S)-1-PEA in PjTA,
Arg417′ needs to move out of the active site tunnel to allow
binding of the substrate’s phenyl group. However, during the
second half-reaction it moves in to interact with the
carboxylate group of pyruvate, facilitating its conversion toL-
Ala. Thus, the lower activity caused by the S87D mutation is
consistent with the formation of a salt bridge with Arg417′,a s
it deprives the active site of a residue involved in the catalysis,
while the increase in activity for the S87N mutation may be
related to an increase inﬂexibility of the Arg417′ side chain.
Finally, for mutation I154V the crystal structures reveal
conformations agreeing with the predicted structure (Figure
10A,B). This strongest stabilizing mutation simply shortened
the side chain by a methyl group, suggesting that the original
methyl group made unfavorable interactions. It indeed appears
that in the wild type Ile154 is under strain; the dihedral angle
among its C, Cα,C β, and Cγ1 atoms is an unfavorable−90.4°.
The e ﬀect of the dihedral angle was modeled using an
Amber14 force ﬁeld (which has clear and separate terms for
van der Waals interactions and dihedral energies). Setting said
dihedral angle to an ideal −61°, identical with the dihedral
angle in the structure of R4 and R6, indeed lowered the
dihedral energies (ΔE
dihedral = −2 kJ/(mol subunit)), while the
steric clashes increased tremendously (ΔEvan der Waals=7 × 102
kJ/(mol subunit)). Inspection shows that Ile154 has to adopt
the strained dihedral angle to diminish steric clashes with
His321′ and Phe323′ (Figure 10C). Thus, a relief of steric
strain at the interface can explain the strong stabilizing eﬀect of
this subtle mutation. The 3.5-fold increase in catalytic activity
by I154V could be due to eﬀects on the tunnel leading to the
active site. The I154V mutation causes a shift of 0.6 Å of
residue Tyr151 toward Tyr20, decreasing the shape of the
active-site entrance tunnel ( Figure 10 D) with no major
backbone changes. These small changes caused by the I154V
mutation remodeling the tunnel shape might inﬂuence the
access of cosolvent or substrates to the active site and inﬂuence
catalytic activity. Enhanced resistance of a dehalogenase
toward cosolvents was also attributed to tunnel mutations by
Koudelakova et al.
65
Because mutation I154V was also found by the consensus
approach, it is less likely that the same substitution can be
applied to closely related proteins. Indeed, a valine is already
present in the homologousOchrobactrum anthropi TA (PDB
5GHF, 63% sequence identity, Val154),
66 Vf TA (4E3Q, 40%
identity, Val153), whereas inCvTA (4AH3, 40% identity),58,67
Ser154 is present at the corresponding position; in all cases the
local bond angles do not suggest strain. Furthermore, the
subunit interfacial areas of these three TAs are similar, as is
apparent from an analysis using PISA
68 (5250, 5300, and 4800
Å2 for PjTA, CvTA, and Vf TA, respectively), whereas it is
smaller for OaAT (∼4000 Å2).
The crystal structures thus reveal that the biophysical nature
of the stabilizing eﬀects of the designed mutations is diverse.
Most of the observed eﬀects are in agreement with known
biophysical interactions that contribute to the stability of
folded proteins, including mutations stabilizing subunit
interfaces.
11 Surprisingly, the largest contribution to enhanced
stability is made by substitution I154V, which eliminates strain
that is present in the wild-type protein. Enhanced stability by
reduced strain is rarely reported, and its discovery by energy
calculations and molecular dynamics illustrates the power of
computational tools.
■ CONCLUSIONS
In this work, we used computational design, bioinformatics,
and laboratory screening to discover mutations that enhanced
the thermostability, cosolvent resistance, IPA compatibility,
and catalytic activity of the recently discovered dimeric class III
transaminase (TA) fromP. jessenii (PjTA). The mainﬁndings
are (1) mutations that stabilize the interface had a much larger
positive eﬀect on PjTA stability in comparison to buried or
surface mutations and (2) stabilizing mutations at the interface
could be predicted with a high success rate with the
computational design tools used in the FRESCO workﬂow.
The conﬁrmed individual mutations could be combined and
showed cooperative eﬀects, and the ﬁnal enzymes can be
considered thermophilic in view of their optimum temperature.

the I154V mutation. (C) Comparison of Ile154 (green) from the wild
type against a simulated Ile rotamer (blue) with its ideal dihedral
angle, showing how the wild type adopts a strained conformation to
reduce steric clashes with His321′ and Phe323′. (D) Comparison of
residues forming the active-site entrance tunnel in the wild-type and
R4 crystal structures, showing how the I154V mutation causes a slight
shift in the position of the Tyr151 side chain. The shift aﬀects the
shape of the tunnel leading to the cofactor binding site. Distances are
in Å.

The importance of improving interface interactions for
better ω-TA stability agrees with observations that inactivation
is accompanied by subunit dissociation. Crystal structures of
the stabilizedPjTA enzymes showed that the mutations can be
explained by improved biophysical interactions: additional
hydrogen bonding or salt-bridge interactions (S87D/N,
E38Q), increased hydrophobic interactions (A60V), introduc-
tion ofπ-stacking (M128F), reduced exposure of hydrophobic
surface (P9A), redistribution of electrostatic surface charge
(E38Q), and relief of steric strain (I154V).
The stabilizing mutations replace residues that show no high
B factors in the crystal structures and were mostly not
discovered by testing a set of consensus mutations. In general,
structures predicted and used by the FoldX and Rosetta energy
calculations agreed with the crystal structures, with the
exception of Arg417′ in the R6 variant. The use of more
stringent energy criteria for selecting mutations did not give a
signiﬁcant increase in the percentage of stabilizing mutations
among the selected variants.
The two most robust variants showed increased perform-
ance in acetophenone amination reactions, better tolerance to
cosolvents, compatibility with high levels of the amino donor
(IPA), and improved product yield, while the enantioselectivity
was fully retained. The results suggest that the use of this
computational workﬂow to discover stabilizing mutations and
optimize subunit interfaces in multimeric enzymes will help to
create stable biocatalysts for use in green chemistry.
