Abstract 
Background: 3‑Hydroxypropionic acid (3‑HP) is an important platform chemical which can be produced biologically 
from glycerol. Klebsiella pneumoniae is an ideal biocatalyst for 3‑HP because it can grow well on glycerol and natu‑
rally synthesize the essential coenzyme  B12. On the other hand, if higher yields and titers of 3‑HP are to be achieved, 
the sustained regeneration of  NAD+ under anaerobic conditions, where coenzyme  B12 is synthesized sustainably, is 
required.
Results: In this study, recombinant K. pneumoniae L17 overexpressing aldehyde dehydrogenase (AldH) was devel‑
oped and cultured in a bioelectrochemical system (BES) with the application of an electrical potential to the anode 
using a chronoamperometric method (+0.5 V vs. Ag/AgCl). The BES operation resulted in 1.7‑fold enhancement of 
3‑HP production compared to the control without the applied potential. The intracellular NADH/NAD+ ratio was 
significantly lower when the L17 cells were grown under an electric potential. The interaction between the electrode 
and overexpressed AldH was enhanced by electron shuttling mediated by HNQ (2‑hydroxy‑1,4‑naphthoquinone).
Conclusions: Enhanced 3‑HP production by the BES was achieved using recombinant K. pneumoniae L17. The 
quinone‑based electron transference between the electrode and L17 was investigated by respiratory uncoupler 
experiments. This study provides a novel strategy to control the intracellular redox states to enhance the yield and 
titer of 3‑HP production as well as other bioconversion processes.

Background
3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP;  C3H6O3) has attracted 
interest because of its wide applications in the synthe -
sis of various value-added chemicals, such as acrylic 
acid, acrylamide, and propiolactone [ 1, 2]. According to 
a report by the U.S. Department of Energy, 3-HP is one 
of the top 12 value-added platform chemicals that can 
be produced biologically but the process requires urgent 
development [ 3]. To date, many studies including the 
development of genetically and metabolically engineered 
microbial strains have been conducted to improve the 
yield and titer for the commercial production of 3-HP 
[4–7]. 3-HP can be produced from glucose and glycerol 
as the carbon sources, both of which are renewable and 
abundant.
3-HP can be synthesized from glucose as the carbon 
source via phosphoenolpyruvate or pyruvate. On the 
other hand, various problems of these pathways, such 
as the excessive accumulation of toxic byproducts, inap -
propriate redox balance, insufficient expression of active 
enzyme(s), and/or negative net ATP generation, have

been reported [8 ]. With glycerol is used as the carbon 
source, 3-HP is produced by a two-step reaction: glycerol 
to 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA) by glycerol dehy -
dratase (GDHt) and then to 3-HP by aldehyde dehydroge-
nase (AldH) (Fig. 1). GDHt essentially requires coenzyme 
 B12 or S-adenosyl methionine (SAM) as a cofactor, and 
AldH requires NAD(P) + as a cofactor for 3-HP produc -
tion. The pathway for glycerol to 3-HP is simpler than that 
starting from glucose. Furthermore, glycerol is cheaper 
than glucose because the former is generated abundantly 
as a major byproduct in the biodiesel industry.
Klebsiella pneumoniae is a natural 3-HP producer with 
several advantages in 3-HP production over other strains. 
The strain can grow well on glycerol to a high cell density 
at a fast rate even under anaerobic condition. In addition, 
it expresses a coenzyme  B
12-dependent GDHt (called 
DhaB) that is less sensitive to oxygen than the SAM-
dependent GDHt. Furthermore, it can produce sufficient 
amounts of coenzyme  B
12 for the catalysis of DhaB under 
anaerobic conditions [9]. In comparison, most well-
known fermentative hosts, such as E. coli do not grow 
well on glycerol under anaerobic conditions and cannot 
produce coenzyme  B
12. Coenzyme  B12 is very expensive 
($531/g), making it unsuitable for addition directly to the 
culture medium. On the other hand, K. pneumoniae was 
reported to produce up to 83.8 g/L of 3-HP without the 
external supplementation of coenzyme  B
12, which pro -
vides a great advantage of mass production of 3-HP [5]. 
For the successful production of 3-HP by K. pneumoniae, 
the overexpression and/or heterologous expression of 
highly active AldH is essential due to the low innate AldH 
activity in the wild-type strains [10].

The reaction by AldH generates NADH from  NAD+ 
by the oxidation of 3-HPA to 3-HP; consequently, the 
continuous regeneration of  NAD+ is crucial, as shown 
in Fig.  1. If  NAD+ is not regenerated properly, this reac -
tion would stop immediately. Furthermore, a high cellu -
lar NADH level due to its improper oxidation to  NAD+ 
causes the accumulation of undesired byproducts, such 
as lactate and ethanol. The simplest and most inexpensive 
way for  NAD
+ regeneration is to accelerate the electron 
transport chain (ETC). However,  NAD+ regeneration 
via aerobic respiration is not preferred when using K. 
pneumoniae as a host for 3-HP production from glyc -
erol. Under aerobic conditions, expression of the DHA 
regulon, which includes dhaB, and the coenzyme  B
12 syn-
thetic pathway are significantly suppressed. In addition, 
the DhaB enzyme and its cofactor, coenzyme  B
12, are 
unstable under aerobic conditions [11, 12]. To solve this 
problem, anaerobic respiration using a chemical elec -
tron acceptor, such as nitrate, has been attempted, but 
it is expensive and the reduction of nitrate yields nitrite, 
which is toxic and seriously inhibits the cellular metabo
-
lism [9, 13].
Some microorganisms, called exoelectrogens, can 
deliver respiratory electrons to solid electrodes under 
anaerobic conditions. The microbe–electrode interac
-
tion via extracellular electron transfer to an electrode 
is intriguing because it offers an alternative way to con
-
trol the cellular redox states, and does not rely on ETC 
or fermentation (e.g., production of reduced metabo
-
lites) [14]. The use of a bioelectrochemical system ena -
bles thermodynamically unfeasible metabolisms, i.e., 
unbalanced fermentation, to proceed. Proof-of-concept 
experimental results have already been presented for 
electrochemically active microbes, such as Geobacter 
sulfurreducens [15, 16], Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 [17, 
18], and K. pneumoniae L17 [19]. The production of bio
-
chemicals and biofuels with the bioelectrochemical sys -
tem has also been investigated, e.g., butyrate production 
with Clostridium tyrobutyricum by instigating a cathodic 
reduction reaction [20] and the production of electron-
dense metabolites (such as butanol and 1,3-propanediol) 
by C. pasteurianum [21]. Nevertheless, most of these 
studies focused on cathode-based electro-fermentation 
rather than an anode-based process. For anode-based 
studies, the production of ethanol and acetate by engi
-
neered E. coli and the production of ethanol by a co-cul -
ture of G. sulfurreducens and C. cellobioparum have been 
attempted; however, the metabolite titers were neither 
reported nor enhanced significantly compared to those 
in the conventional, non-bioelectrochemical system [22, 
23].
In this study, anodic electro-fermentation by recom
-
binant K. pneumoniae L17 was investigated for the 
production of 3-HP from glycerol (see the Additional 
file 1: Figure S1). This paper reports that the conventional 
limitation of the redox imbalance in fermentation can be 
overcome using bioelectrochemical system approaches. 
The results show that overexpressed AldH and the use of 
an electrode is well coordinated via a microbial anaerobic 
respiratory module. To the best of the authors’ knowl
-
edge, this is the first report of the successful application 
of the anodic electro-fermentation, and an improvement 
of 3-HP production.
Methods
Bacterial strains and media composition
To develop efficient 3-HP producer strains, K. pneu -
moniae L17 (herein after L17W) and E. coli DH5ɑ were 
purchased from CCTCC (China Center for Type Cul
-
ture Collection) and KCCM (Korean Culture Center of 
Microorganisms), respectively. The recombinant K. pneu
-
moniae strain was prepared using the pUC19/KGSADH 
vector, which is well-developed for high rates of expres
-
sion of aldehyde dehydrogenase (AldH), with KGSADH 
(ɑ-ketoglutaric semialdehyde dehydrogenase) [10]. The 
transformation of pUC19/KGSADH to K. pneumoniae 
L17 (herein after L17K) was conducted using the method 
reported elsewhere [24]. Additional file  1: Table S1 lists 
the bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study 
(Additional file  1: Table S1). For strain maintenance, all 
strains used in this study were grown in LB medium and 
stored at −80  °C. The modified M9 medium was used 
for the 3-HP fermentation experiments using the follow
-
ing composition (per liter): 1 g NaCl, 1 g  NH4Cl, 0.25 g 
 MgSO4·7H2O, 13.53  g  K2HPO4, 3.03  g  KH2PO4, 1  g 
yeast extract, 2 g glucose, 11.05 g glycerol, 12.5 ml vita -
min solution [25], and 12.5  ml trace element solution 
[25]. The medium was adjusted to pH 7.2 using 10% HCl 
and 5  N NaOH solutions. A 0.1  mM solution of filter-
sterilized HNQ (2-hydroxy-1,4-naphthoquinone, neutral 
orange 6) was added to the anode chamber as an electron 
shuttle between the bacteria and electrode.
Bioelectrochemical system (BES) configuration
H-type BES reactors were constructed from two glass 
bottles (310 ml capacity each, Duran, USA) with a glass 
tube bridge (inner diameter: 1.25 cm) containing a pro
-
ton exchange membrane (PEM, Nafion 117, Dupont, 
Del. USA). A 20 wt% wet-proof carbon cloth (Nara Cell-
Tech Co., Korea) was used for both the anode and cath
-
ode electrodes (2 cm  × 5 cm). A Ag/AgCl electrode was 
installed in the anode chamber as the reference electrode. 
The anode chamber was filled with 250 mL of modified 
M9 medium. A 100  mM potassium ferricyanide solu
-
tion dissolved in a 100  mM potassium phosphate solu -
tion (pH  =  7.5) was added to the cathode chamber. All 
Page 4 of 11Kim et al. Biotechnol Biofuels  (2017) 10:199 
the components were pre-washed with 10% of HCl and 
5 N NaOH solutions. The medium and BES reactors were 
sterilized at 121  °C for 15  min by autoclaving. Before 
starting the experiments, all strains tested were pre-cul
-
tured overnight in LB medium, and incubated for 12 h in 
M9 medium for activation. The pre-cultivated cells were 
inoculated in the anode chamber to an initial cell concen
-
tration of  OD600 = 0.05. A 100 μM solution of ampicillin 
(L17W) or 50 μM of kanamycin (L17K) was added to the 
anode and cathode chamber to prevent contamination 
and plasmid stabilization.
BES operation
Both the anode and cathode electrodes were connected 
via a 1 kΩ external resistance or a potentiostat for closed 
circuit operation (BES operating condition), whereas 
in non-BES operation, the anode was not connected to 
the resistance and cathode electrode (i.e., open circuit). 
Hence, the anode electrode in non-BES reactors does 
not accept the respiratory electrons produced from the 
metabolic pathway. Both BES and non-BES reactors were 
placed in a shaking incubator at 37 °C at 100 rpm. Before 
starting the BES experiments, both the anode and cath
-
ode chambers were purged with 99.9% of nitrogen gas to 
remove the dissolved oxygen. In the recombinant strain 
experiments, 0.2 mM of IPTG was added to induce AldH 
expression. The poised potential was applied to the anode 
using chronoamperometry (+0.5  V vs. Ag/AgCl) and a 
potentiostat (VersaSTAT 3, AMETEK, USA). The average 
current was monitored at 1 min intervals during the BES 
operation for glycerol fermentation.
Inhibitor experiments
To determine the electron transfer mechanism between 
the anode electrode and bacterial anaerobic respiration 
for 3-HP production, the BES reactors were operated 
under spontaneous electron discharge to the anode with 
a fixed resistance (1 kΩ), instead of using a potentiostat. 
All the operating conditions were the same as those of 
the BES reactors described previously. The effect of the 
respiratory inhibitors such as rotenone (1  mM in final), 
antimycin A (0.5 μM), sodium azide (1 mM) were inves
-
tigated in the BES reactor. The control BES reactor con -
tained the same amount of ethanol and DI water, and was 
connected to a fixed resistance (1 kΩ). The current gen
-
eration and 3-HP production with the different inhibitors 
were monitored.
Analyses
Cell growth, pH change, NADH/NAD+ ratio, and metab-
olites production were determined by sampling the fer -
mentation broth from the anode chamber at 0, 3, 6, 8, 
12, 24, and 32  h. Planktonic cell growth and pH were 
determined by measuring the optical density (600  nm 
wavelength) and using a pH meter, respectively. The liq
-
uid samples were centrifuged at 5000  rpm for 10  min. 
The NADH/NAD
+ ratio of the pellets was analyzed 
by colorimetric kit quantification (Biovision, USA), as 
described previously [9]. The supernatants were filtered 
using a syringe filter (0.22 μm, Nylon membrane, What
-
man, UK). The filtered samples were analyzed to iden -
tify the metabolite concentrations by high performance 
liquid chromatography (HPLC, HP 1160 series, Agi
-
lent Technologies, USA) equipped with a 300  × 7.8 mm 
Aminex HPX-87H (Bio-Rad, USA) column at 65  °C 
and a refractive index (RI) and photodiode array (PDA) 
detector, using 2.5 mM  H
2SO4 as the mobile phase (flow 
rate = 0.5 mL/s). The currents generated were analyzed 
by a computer-based data acquisition (DAQ) system (NI-
USB6218; National Instruments, USA) with LabVIEW
™ 
(National Instruments, USA).
Results and discussion
Electron transfer to the anode electrode by L17W and L17K
The anode electrode in the BES captures the respiratory 
electrons discharged from glycerol degradation, and the 
current (i.e., coulomb per sec, C/s) can be used as an 
indicator of the rate of extracellular electron transport 
from the strains. Figure  2 shows the current generation 
observed from the wild-type (L17W) and recombinant 
K. pneumoniae (L17K) in the BES reactors. Compared 
to L17W, L17K produced a significantly higher current 
under BES conditions. One hour after inoculation, the 
current generated increased exponentially and was cor
-
related with cell growth (Additional file  1: Figure S2). 
Approximately 25.2 and 134.3  mmol of electrons were 
estimated to have been transferred to the electrode

in the BES reactors by L17W and L17K, respectively, 
based on the estimation with Faraday’s constant (96,485  
C/mole of  e−). These results suggest that approximately 
5 times more respiratory electrons were transferred from 
the L17K cell metabolism than that from L17W. The 
enhanced extracellular electron transfer to the electrode 
is expected to alter the metabolite production profile, 
along with the cellular redox rebalance.
Glycerol consumption and production of metabolites 
in BES
The L17W and L17K strains were grown on glycerol in 
BES and non-BES, and cell growth and metabolite pro -
duction were compared (Fig.  3 and Additional file  1: 
Figure S2). Under both conditions, L17W grew slightly 
better than L17K (Additional file  1: Figure S2). Nev
-
ertheless, the effects of electron flow to the electrode 
did not affect cell growth significantly under BES and 
non-BES circumstances. Figure  3 presents the concen
-
tration profiles of glycerol, 3-HP , and 1,3-propanediol 
(1,3-PDO) during fermentation. Most of the glycerol was 
consumed within 24  h when L17W was used, whereas 
21 and 38% of the residual glycerol still remained with 
L17K fermentation: BES (25.0  ±  3.8  mM) and non-BES 
(44.3 ± 1.3 mM), respectively. The synthesis of 3-HP by 
L17W between BES and non-BES was similar (14.1  ± 2.1 
and 12.0  ±  1.1  mM, respectively). Consequently, 
L17W produced a similar amount of 3-HP in both BES 
(14.1 ± 2.1 mM) and non-BES (12.0  ± 1.1 mM). In com
-
parison, L17K produced 1.7 times more 3-HP in BES 
(21.5 ± 2.2 mM) than in non-BES (12.9 ± 3.2 mM).
The overexpression of AldH is essential to shift the 
metabolic flux of 3-hydroxypropanal (3-HPA) toward 
3-HP from 1,3-PDO (Table  1). In recombinant L17K, 
anodic electro-fermentation appeared to have enhanced 
the directional selectivity to 3-HP between the two 
metabolic pathways (see Fig.  1). With L17W, the final 
1,3-PDO production in BES and non-BES were simi
-
lar: 27.4  ±  4.7 and 26.9  ±  1.7  mM, respectively. On 
the other hand, AldH-overexpressing L17K produced 
a lower 1,3-PDO in BES (9.46  ± 3.6 mM) than in non-
BES (15.4 ± 4.6 mM). The increased 2,3-butanediol (2,3-
BDO) production of L17K was observed only in BES 
(19.9  ±  0.3  mM), but not under the other conditions: 
6.8 ± 0.1 and 6.7  ± 0.4 mM by L17W in BES and non-
BES, respectively, 10.5  ±  2.0  mM by L17K in non-BES 
(Additional file  1: Figure S3). The production of other 
metabolites was similar in BES and non-BES (Additional 
file  1: Figure S3). To identify the cellular redox states, 
the NADH/NAD
+ ratios were also determined (Fig.  4). 
BES with L17W showed a slightly lower ratio than that 
with non-BES (Fig.  4a). On the other hand, L17K exhib
-
ited a significantly lower NADH in BES than in non-BES 
(Fig.  4b), indicating that anodic electron transfer was 
quite high under the BES as shown in Fig. 2 .
Shift of the cellular redox balance under BES conditions
The addition of HNQ to the culture medium can enhance 
the quinone shuttle-based electron transfer to the elec
-
trode, and activate the anaerobic respiratory pathways 
of K. pneumoniae L17 [19]. The metabolic flux under 
anaerobic conditions proceeds in a similar manner to 
that under (micro) aerobic conditions. Similar results 
were obtained in Shewanella sp. under MFC conditions, 
as reported by Matsuda et  al. [26]. The introduction of 
AldH to K. pneumoniae increases electron transfer to 
the electrode significantly, as shown in Fig.  2. In a pre
-
vious report, the K. pneumoniae DSMZ overexpressing 
AldH reduced more nitrate than the wild-type counter
-
part [9]. The improvement of anaerobic respiration (via 
nitrate reduction) was attributed to the coordination of 
 NAD
+-dependent oxidase (i.e., AldH) and NADH oxi -
doreductase (i.e., NADH:Ubiquinone reductase).
The glycerol metabolism and its carbon distribution 
in K. pneumoniae was determined by two regulons, glp 
and dha (see Fig.  1). The glp regulon includes glycerol 
kinase (GlpK) and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase 
(GlpD), both of which are expressed under aerobic con
-
ditions and play a major role in the oxidative assimila -
tion of glycerol. The glp regulon can also be activated 
under anaerobic respiratory conditions, particularly with 
an extracellular electron acceptor. The GlpD enzyme is 
located in the cytoplasmic membrane and catalyzes the 
following reaction:
In the other glycerol assimilation pathways, the dha 
modules consist of two reaction pathways involved in 
two associated enzymes, glycerol dehydrogenase (DhaD) 
with dihydroxyacetone kinase (DhaK), and glycerol dehy
-
dratase (DhaB) with propanediol oxidoreductase (DhaT). 
In the glycerol-reductive pathway catalyzed by DhaB, 
3-HPA can be converted to either 3-HP or 1,3-PDO. The 
production of these two metabolites is conducted by 
controversial reactions, 3-HPA reduction for 1,3-PDO 
production (NADH-dependent propanediol dehydro
-
genase, dhaT) or 3-HPA oxidation for 3-HP production 
 (NAD
+-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase, puuC). 
Therefore, the 1,3-PDO: 3-HP ratio was governed by the 
cellular redox states. The glycerol-reductive pathways are 
more highly activated under anaerobic conditions (i.e., 
high NADH/NAD
+ ratio conditions); therefore, most of 
the 3-HPA would be transformed to 1,3-PDO in wild-type 
K. pneumoniae. In balanced fermentation (i.e., conven
-
tional fermentation), predominant 3-HP production from

glycerol is practically difficult; therefore, co-production 
with 1,3-PDO was examined to simultaneously improve 
the titer and/or yield of 3-HP production by maintain
-
ing the cellular redox potential [27–30]. In this study, the 
electrode-based control of the cellular redox potential 
was applied to promote unbalanced fermentation with a

but also for the production of various biochemicals, which 
are required to overcome the thermodynamic barriers by

+ level.
Effects of the respiratory inhibitors on current generation 
and 3‑HP production
The coordination mechanism for the overexpressed AldH 
and anode electrode, was examined using various uncou -
plers of the membrane-bound electron transport protein. 
Spontaneous current generation was monitored in the 
presence of several respiratory inhibitors, such as rote
-
none (inhibitor of NADH dehydrogenase I), antimycin A 
(cytochrome c oxidoreductase), and azide (cytochrome 
oxidase). No significant decrease in current generation 
and 3-HP production were observed with the addition 
of rotenone and antimycin A (Fig.  5), while a relatively 
larger decrease in current was obtained with azide. Azide 
blocks electron flow between the cytochrome oxidase 
complex and terminal electron acceptors, such as oxygen 
and ferric compounds [31]. As a consequence, azide has 
been used to decrease the direct electron transport from 
the cell to the electrode in BES.
On the other hand, significantly less current and con
-
currently lower 3-HP production were obtained without 
HNQ, a quinone analogue (Fig.  5). This suggests that the 
electron shuttle (HNQ) pumps out the respiratory elec
-
tron from putative quinone reductase on the cytoplas -
mic membrane, so that a lower NADH/NAD + ratio can 
be maintained within the cell. These results suggest that

BES‑based electron transport chain for 3‑HP production
To implement a BES-based cellular redox control strat -
egy into a bioprocess, an understanding of the electron 
transfer mechanisms and the effects of an externally 
poised potential on the production rate (3-HP in this 
study) are needed. Although previous studies revealed 
various spontaneous electron transfer modules in exo
-
electrogens, the mechanisms of quinone-based electron 
transfer have not been examined extensively. In the pre
-
sent study, it was hypothesized that the externally added 
quinone derivative mediator (HNQ) might interact with 
the respiratory enzymes, e.g., NADH dehydrogenase 
complex I and quinone:cytochrome c oxidoreductase. 
Interestingly, no significant difference in current gen
-
eration and 3-HP production rate were observed in the 
presence of rotenone and antimycin A, which are inhibi
-
tors used widely for NADH dehydrogenase complex I 
and quinone:cytochrome c oxidoreductase, respectively 
(Fig. 5).
Rothery et  al. reported that naphthoquinone can be 
reduced easily by various anaerobic quinone reduc
-
tases, such as menaquinol–nitrate oxidoreductase 
and menaquinol–fumarate oxidoreductase [32]. The 
present results with ETC inhibitors suggest that a 
NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (probably NADH dehy
-
drogenase complex II) and quinone reductase might be 
activated during the anaerobic respiration of K. pneumo
-
niae in BES. Electron flow during glycerol conversion to 
3-HP with K. pneumoniae in BES can be hypothesized 
as follows: (1) NADH formed by KGSADH is oxidized 
by a putative NADH:quinone oxidoreductase (or NADH 
dehydrogenase complex II), (2) reduced menaquinones 
(in the quinone pool) deliver their electrons to anaerobic 
quinone reductase(s), (3) HNQ reduction occurs by the 
action of the putative anaerobic quinone reductase(s), 
and (4) reduced HNQ transfers electrons to the elec
-
trode (Fig.  6). Interestingly, the AldH overexpressed 
K. pneumoniae (L17K) produced higher 3-HP levels in 
BES, while the wild-type strain (L17W) both in BES and 
non-BES, and L17K in non-BES, showed similar levels of 
3-HP production (Fig. 3). These results suggest that AldH 
interacts indirectly with the electrode via HNQ to deliver 
a respiratory electron. Further study for a synergistic 
pathway for combined metabolic engineering and BES 
will provide a platform technology to regulate the cellu
-
lar redox potential, and improve the yield and titer of the 
target value-added chemicals.
The substitution of a petroleum-based chemical refin
-
ery with a sustainable biorefinery has been highlighted 
as one of the future goals of green technology. With the 
help of the recent advances in multi-OMICS and inno
-
vative bioprocesses, the biological production of various 
platform chemicals and an improvement of their yield/
titer have become easier. Nevertheless, regulation and 
control of the cellular redox potential to improve the 
yield/selectivity and reduce the production cost, remains 
a challenge. Electro-fermentation is a promising alterna
-
tive to traditional redox control methods, such as oxygen 
sparging, and the addition of co-substrates and chemi
-
cal reagents [33]. Furthermore, electro-fermentation can 
provide a tool to break the theoretical maximum pro
-
ductivity of conventional fermentation, which is set by 
the innate cellular metabolism. The strategy suggested in 
the present study can be also used as an energy storage 
and efficient utilization method for electrical energy from 
diverse electricity-based renewable energy and a carbon-
neutral power plant with the simultaneous production of 
high value-added chemicals [34].
This paper is the first report on the enhancement 
of 3-HP bioproduction using electro-fermentation.

The BES-based cellular redox control strategy dem -
onstrated proof-of-principle, even though the 3-HP 
titer and volumetric productivity so far lack the levels 
for industrial relevance. To achieve industrial-scale 
application, further study will be needed to develop a 
large-scale and cost-effective BES reactor for electro-
fermentation, by implementing electrode-based anodic 
and cathodic reactors. The membrane-based BES pro
-
cesses (e.g., electrodialysis) which proceed the produc -
tion and separation of products simultaneously, have

been extensively investigated, and are highly applica -
ble to electro-fermentation [35– 38]. The finely tunable 
electrochemical control strategy as well as genetic and 
metabolic engineering to redirect the metabolic fluxes 
and remove the byproduct production pathways, are 
also anticipated.
Conclusions
The application of a bioelectrochemical system facilitated 
the enhanced production of 3-HP via the activation of 
anaerobic respiration to regulate the NADH/NAD
+ ratio. 
The overexpressed AldH and electrode-based respiration 
mediated by an electron shuttle resulted in higher 3-HP 
production under BES conditions. This study provides a 
novel strategy to control the cellular redox states to over
-
come the yield and titer limited in conventional fermen -
tation, which can be applied not only to 3-HP production, 
but also to other bioconversion processes through altered 
cell redox states.
