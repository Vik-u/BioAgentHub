The genome of Streptomyces scabies, the predominant causal agent of potato common scab, encodes a potential cutinase,
the protein Sub1, which was previously shown to be specifically induced in the presence of suberin. The sub1 gene was
expressed in Escherichia coli and the recombinant protein Sub1 was purified and characterized. The enzyme was shown to
be versatile because it hydrolyzes a number of natural and synthetic substrates. Sub1 hydrolyzed p-nitrophenyl esters, with
the hydrolysis of those harboring short carbon chains being the most effective. The Vmax and Km values of Sub1 for p-
nitrophenyl butyrate were 2.36 mol g –1 min–1 and 5.7 10–4 M, respectively. Sub1 hydrolyzed the recalcitrant polymers cutin
and suberin because the release of fatty acids from these substrates was observed following the incubation of the enzyme
with these polymers. Furthermore, the hydrolyzing activity of the esterase Sub1 on the synthetic polymer polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) was demonstrated by the release of terephthalic acid (TA). Sub1 activity on PET was markedly
enhanced by the addition of Triton and was shown to be stable at 37°C for at least 20 d.

Streptomycetes are Gram-positive bacteria that are known
for their ability to produce a wide range of secondary
metabolites and for the complexity of their morphological
development. Although most streptomycetes species are
saprophytic soil inhabitants, some are plant pathogens.
Among them, Streptomyces scabies is the predominant
causal agent of potato common scab and causes important
economic losses in Canada (Hill and Lazarovits, 2005), as
well as in most potato growing areas. Common scab is char‐
acterized by corky lesions on the surface of potato tubers.
Similar to other soil-inhabiting streptomycetes, S. scabies
produces a large variety of extracellular enzymes, including
various glycosyl hydrolases and esterases (Komeil et al.,
2013; Beaulieu et al., 2016). These enzymes may participate
in pathogenesis because the penetration of S. scabies into
host plants is considered to be facilitated by the secretion of
extracellular cell wall-degrading enzymes (Beauséjour et
al., 1999).
The potato tuber is covered by a periderm that is com‐
posed of three types of tissues: phellem, phellogen, and
phelloderm (Tyner et al., 1997). The wall of phellem cells
impregnated with suberin, a plant polymer recalcitrant to
bio-degradation, is composed of a polyaromatic domain
covalently linked to a polyaliphatic moiety (Bernards,
2002). The polyaromatic domain, a lignin-like structure,
consists of a hydroxycinnamic acid-derived polymeric
matrix (Bernards and Lewis, 1998). The polyaliphatic
domain shares structural and chemical similarities with
cutin, another polyester component of plant cuticles. Cutin
and suberin both act as physical barriers against plant patho‐

gens (Khatri et al., 2011). Cutin and suberin are polymers of
fatty acid derivatives linked by ester bonds. Cutin is mostly
composed of C16 and C18 ω-hydroxyacids, polyhydroxya‐
cids, epoxyacids, and α,ω-dicarboxylic acids. Suberin may
be distinguished from cutin by higher contents of hydroxy‐
cinnamic acids, fatty alcohols, and saturated aliphatics with
long chains (Beisson et al., 2012).
Cutinases hydrolyze the plant leaf cuticle by cleaving the
ester bounds of cutin (Dutta et al. , 2009). Therefore, cuti‐
nases belong to the esterase group, and more specifically to
a class of serine esterases that contain the catalytic triad
(serine, histidine and aspartate) with the active serine in the
consensus sequence Gly-His/Tyr-Ser-X-Gly (Martinez et al.,
1994). Some fungal cutinases, such as the cutinase CcCUT1
of the fungus Coprinopsis cinerea, also exhibit the ability to
degrade suberin (Kontkanen et al. , 2009). As lipolytic
enzymes, cutinases have interesting properties for applica‐
tions in various industrial processes (Carvalho et al., 1999).
For example, some cutinases exhibit the ability to degrade
synthetic polyesters, such as polycaprolactone (Murphy et
al., 1996) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
(Vertommen et al., 2005; Eberl et al., 2009; Ribitsch et al.,
2015).
Previous studies suggested that the bacterium S. scabies
possesses the ability to degrade suberin. This pathogenic
bacterium exhibits strong esterase activity in the presence of
suberized tissues (Beauséjour et al. , 1999). Furthermore, a
secretome analysis of S. scabies cultures grown in the pres‐
ence of suberin revealed the presence of esterases, which are
predicted to play a role in lipid metabolism (Komeil et al.,
2014; Beaulieu et al., 2016). Among them, the Sub1 protein
exhibits 33% identity with the cutinase CcCUT1 of the fun‐
gus C. cinerea (Komeil et al. , 2013). Interestingly, sub1

gene expression was previously reported to be specifically
induced in the presence of suberin (Komeil et al., 2013).
The cutinase from Aspergillus oryzae (PDB ID: 3GBS) is
hallmarked by a central β-sheet of five parallel strands sur‐
rounded by ten α-helices (Liu et al., 2009), as found for the
predicted three-dimensional structure of the protein Sub1
(Supplemental Fig. S1). The model of the Sub1 protein also
predicts the formation of two disulfide bonds (Cys31–Cys103;
Cys178–Cys185) and a catalytic triad including residues Ser
114, Asp 182, and His 195 (Komeil et al., 2013).
The main objectives of the present study were to produce
the Sub1 protein, purify and characterize its enzymatic prop‐
erties, and demonstrate that it functions as a polyesterase
with the ability to degrade biopolymers, such as cutin and
suberin, as well as the synthetic polyester PET.
Materials and Methods
Bacterial strains and culture conditions
An inoculum of S. scabies EF-35 (HER1481) was prepared in
tryptic soy broth (10 8 spores in 25 mL), as described previously
(Komeil et al., 2013). Cultures of S. scabies EF-35 were incubated
with shaking (250 rpm) at 30°C. Escherichia coli strains DH5α
(Invitrogen) and SHuffle T7 (New England Biolabs) were grown
in LB medium supplemented where necessary with kanamycin
(30 μg mL –1) and were then incubated with shaking (250 rpm) at
37°C.
Suberin and cutin preparation
A suberin-enriched potato periderm was obtained as previously
described (Kolattukudy and Agrawal, 1974). The extracted mate‐
rial was dried under a hood, ground using a coffee mill, and stored
at room temperature. To further remove residual polysaccharides in
the potato periderm, this material was exposed to microbial degra‐
dation in the presence of S. scabies EF-35, as described by
Beaulieu et al. (2016). The S. scabies inoculum (1 mL) was added
to 50 mL of minimal medium consisting of a mineral solution
(0.5 g L–1 [NH4]2SO4, 0.5 g L –1 K2HPO4, 0.2 g L –1 MgSO4-7H2O,
and 10 mg L –1 FeSO4-7H2O) and 1 g L –1 of the suberin-enriched
potato periderm. After a 30-d incubation, 10 mL of fresh mineral
solution and 200 μL of the S. scabies inoculum were both added to
the culture and the incubation was extended for an additional 30 d.
The culture was centrifuged at 3,450×g for 20 min, and the pellet
was resuspended in 100 mL of sterile water and then autoclaved
for 15 min. The suspension was washed with sterile water to
remove bacterial cell debris. The resulting material (purified potato
suberin) was dried at 50°C for 24 h. Cutin was isolated from apples
following the protocol of Walton and Kolattukudy (1972).
DNA extraction
Genomic DNA was isolated from 48-h bacterial cultures of S.
scabies EF-35 using the GenElute Bacterial Genomic DNA Kit
(Sigma-Aldrich) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Plasmid DNA was isolated from 12-h E. coli cultures using the
GenEluteTM Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Sigma-Aldrich) following the
manufacturer’s instructions.
Cloning of sub1 in E. coli
The sub1 coding sequence, deprived of its signal peptide (Gen‐
Bank accession number MK689853), was amplified by PCR from
the genomic DNA of S. scabies EF-35 using the primers F-pET
(5′-ATATCCATGGCCGCCTGCACGGACATCG-3′) and R-pET
(5′-ATATCTCGAGTTAGATCTTGGTCGCGGCGAAGG-3′). The
PCR mix contained 20 ng of DNA, 2.5 μL of Taq polymerase buf‐
fer, 0.5 μL of dNTPs (10 mM), 0.5 μL (each) of forward and
reverse primers (10 μM), and 0.125 μL of DNA Taq polymerase
(New England Biolabs), in a total volume of 25 μL. PCR condi‐
tions consisted of 2 min at 95°C followed by 30 cycles at 95°C for
30 s, at 64°C for 1 min, and at 68°C for 1 min, with a final exten‐
sion at 68°C for 5 min. PCR was performed using the thermocycler
T100 (Bio-Rad). Amplification products were migrated on a 1%
agarose gel (Sambrook and Russell, 2001), purified from gels
using the MinElute Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen), and cloned into
the pET-30a(+) vector (Novagen). The amplification product and
cloning vector pET-30a(+) were both digested using the restriction
enzymes NcoI and XhoI. Enzyme T4 DNA ligase (New England
Biolabs) was used to ligate plasmid ends to amplicons following
the manufacturer’s instructions. Ligation products were heat
shock-transformed into competent cells of E. coli DH5α as per the
manufacturer’s instructions (New England Biolabs). Bacteria were
then incubated overnight on LB agar medium supplemented with
kanamycin (30 μg mL
–1). The plasmid insert was sequenced at a
sequencing and genome genotyping platform (CHUL, University
Laval, Quebec City, Canada). The plasmid pET-30a(+), with or
without the sub1 insert, was transformed into the expression host
E. coli SHuffle T7, as previously described.
Protein extraction
Cultures of E. coli SHuffle T7 carrying pET without or with the
sub1 gene insert ( E. coli SHuffle T7-pET and E. coli SHuffle T7-
pET-sub1) were incubated on LB agar medium supplemented with
kanamycin. When OD
600 reached 0.6–0.8, isopropyl β-D-1-
thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to the culture (0 to
1.0 mM, final concentration) and bacteria were incubated at 25°C
for an additional 24 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation
(3,450×g) for 10 min, pellets were washed twice with saline (NaCl
0.9%) and then resuspended in a buffer solution (50 mM NaH 2PO4
and 300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0) supplemented with EDTA (2.5 mM).
The suspensions were sonicated on ice four times for 10 s and cen‐
trifuged (3,450× g) at 4°C for 30 min to remove cell debris. The
supernatant was collected and successively passed through filters
with pore sizes of 0.45 and 0.2 μm. The resulting protein solution
was stored at 4°C.
Purification of the protein Sub1
An affinity column Ni-NT cOmplete His-Tag purification col‐
umn (Roche) was used to purify the protein Sub1 from the cyto‐
plasmic fraction of E. coli SHuffle T7-pET-sub1, following the
manufacturer’s instructions. Elution buffer A (50 mM NaH 2PO4,
300 mM NaCl, pH 8.0), supplemented with different concentra‐
tions of imidazole (5 to 250 mM), was used for column washing
and His6-tagged protein elution. Protein fractions were subjected
to sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(SDS-PAGE) migration along with the marker PageRuler™ Pre‐
stained Protein Ladder (Thermo Scientific), as described by
Komeil et al. (2014). Proteins were stained with Coomassie bril‐
liant blue R-250 (Bio-Rad; Lauzier et al., 2008) and fractions con‐
taining purified Sub1 were pooled. This mixture was dialyzed in
phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) to remove imidazole. Protein
concentrations were measured according to Bradford (Bradford,
1976).
Esterase activity of Sub1 on p-nitrophenyl esters
Esterase activity was assessed by spectrophotometrically meas‐
uring the absorbance of p-nitrophenol using the substrates p-
nitrophenyl butyrate (C4), p-nitrophenyl octanoate (C8), p-
nitrophenyl decanoate (C10), and p-nitrophenyl dodecanoate (C12)
(Sigma-Aldrich). The molar extinction coefficient of p-nitrophenol
in Tris-HCl (20 mM, pH 7.5) at room temperature is
12,000 M–1 cm–1 at 420 nm. This enzymatic assay was performed
as described previously (Komeil et al., 2013) with slight modifica‐
tions. In a 1.5-mL plastic cuvette, 20 μL of 100×-diluted Sub1
(60 ng) was added to 970 μL of Tris-HCl (20 mM, pH 7.5), with or
without Triton X-100 (0.5%), and 10 μL of a 20 mM p-nitrophenyl
ester substrate (0.2 mM final concentration). The absorbance at
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
    
Sub1, a suberinase from Streptomyces scabies 3 / 7
420 nm of this reaction mix was measured at room temperature
every 10 s for 1 min. The increase in absorbance of each sample
was read against a blank without purified protein. One unit (U) was
the amount of enzyme liberating 1 μmol of p-nitrophenol min –1
under the assay conditions. The Vmax and Km values of the enzyme
Sub1 were assessed using the software GraphPad Prism7,
according to the Michaelis-Menten equation, with different con‐
centrations of the C4 substrate.
Esterase activity of Sub1 on natural and synthetic polymers
Suberin and cutin were exposed to the enzyme Sub1 as follows.
Suberin or cutin (10 mg) was added to 350 μL of Tris-HCl
(20 mM, pH 7.5) supplemented with 50 μL of the purified enzyme
Sub1 (15 μg). Control assays (blanks) were made of suberin and
cutin without the addition of the enzyme Sub1. The mixture was
incubated at room temperature for 20 d. Colorimetric assays of free
fatty acids released from the biopolymer were performed every 5 d
using a Free Fatty Acid Quantification Colorimetric/Fluorometric
Kit (BioVision) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A
standard curve was prepared with palmitic acid to convert absorb‐
ance at 570 nm into fatty acid concentrations.
The hydrolyzing activity of Sub1 was also estimated on poly‐
ethylene terephthalate (PET) by measuring the amount of tereph‐
thalic acid (TA) released from PET according to Nimchua et al.
(2008) with slight modifications. Assays were conducted in 2-mL
tubes containing 10 mg of PET (ground granules, Sigma-Aldrich),
1 mL of Tris-HCl (20 mM, pH 7.5), and 3 μg of the enzyme Sub1.
In the first experiment, the effects of Triton on Sub1 performance
were tested. Tubes, with or without Triton X-100 (0.5%), were
incubated at 37°C and the concentrations of TA released in the
incubation media were recorded after 10 and 15 d. Blank assays, in
which the enzyme Sub1 was omitted, were used as controls. Tubes
were then centrifuged (1 min) and 50 μL of the collected superna‐
tant was added to 350 μL of Tris-HCl (20 mM, pH 7.5) into quartz
cuvettes. Absorbance at 240 nm was measured to assess TA con‐
centrations (using a standard curve). In another experiment, the
stability of Sub1, using PET as a substrate, was assessed at 37 and
50°C over a 20-d period. The incubation medium contained Triton
X-100 (0.5%) and the concentration of TA released in the reaction
mix was measured every 5 d, as described above.
Results
Heterologous production of Sub1
The S. scabies sub1 gene was cloned into a pET expres‐
sion vector (data not shown) and expressed in E. coli strain
SHuffle T7. The cytoplasmic extract of E. coli SHuffle T7-
pET-sub1 was characterized by a thick and dense band of
approximatively 25 kDa, which was absent from the protein
profile of E. coli SHuffle T7-pET (Fig. 1). In E. coli SHuffle
T7-pET-sub1, Sub1 was produced even in the absence of
IPTG, while thicker protein bands were observed when sub1
gene expression was induced by this compound (Fig. 1).
The cytoplasmic fraction from cultures of E. coli Shuffle
T7-pET-sub1 showed, in the absence of the induction with
IPTG, that esterase activity on the C4 substrate (58.8 μmo l
mL–1) was significantly higher than that in control E. coli
SHuffle T7-pET (1.6 μmol mL–1) after 30 min of the incuba‐
tion (Fig. 2). The esterase activity of E. coli SHuffle T7-
pET-sub1 was inducible with IPTG and was quickly
observable in the reaction mix. After 5 min of the incuba‐
tion, the highest activity reached 32.2 μmol mL –1 when

0.8 mM IPTG was added to the culture, while activity was
6.3 μmol mL–1 in the absence of IPTG (Fig. 2).
Purification of the recombinant protein His-Sub1
An affinity column Ni-NT (cOmplete His-Tag) was used
to purify the recombinant protein Sub1 from the cytoplas‐
mic fraction of E. coli SHuffle T7-pET-sub1. By comparing
the migration profile of the cytoplasmic fraction and the
flow-through (Fig. 3, lanes 2 and 3, respectively), the band
corresponding to the recombinant protein His-Sub1
(25 kDa) was present in the cytoplasmic fraction, while no
band was present in the flow-through fraction, indicating
that the Sub1 protein bound the column. The presence of
imidazole in the elution buffer allows the elution of His-tag
proteins from the column. At imidazole concentrations
ranging between 4 and 10 mM, the elution buffer released
the majority of the contaminant proteins, while a low quan‐
tity of Sub1 was released with 10 mM imidazole (lane 7,
Fig. 3). A detectable quantity of Sub1 was eluted with no
contaminant proteins when 50 mM imidazole buffer was
used (lane 8, Fig. 3). However, at 200 mM imidazole, no
recombinant protein was detected (lane 9, Fig. 3). A mass
spectrometry analysis confirmed that the purified protein
was Sub1 (data not shown). Purification efficacy was esti‐
mated by comparing the esterase activities (with 0.4 mM p-
nitrophenol butyrate as the substrate) of the cytoplasmic
fraction and the purified protein. The esterase activity of
Sub1 was 52-fold higher in the purified extract
(23.0 U mL –1) than in the cytoplasmic crude extract
(0.4 U mL–1).
Esterase activity of the Sub1 protein on p-nitrophenyl esters
The esterase activity of Sub1 on the p-nitrophenyl esters
of varying carbon chain lengths was assessed in the presence
and absence of Triton X-100. Independent of the presence of
Triton X-100, Sub1 was more active on p-nitrophenyl buty‐
rate (C4) and p-nitrophenyl octanoate (C8) than on p-
nitrophenyl esters with longer carbon chains (C10 and C12,
Fig. 4). The presence of Triton X-100 increased the esterase
activity of the enzyme on all of these substrates (Fig. 4). The
highest esterase activity (14.6 U nmol
–1 or 616 U mg –1
Sub1) was obtained on the C4 substrate in the presence of
Triton X-100. Thus, Vmax and Km values for esterase Sub1
were calculated using the latter substrate. As shown in Fig.
5, the initial velocity (V 0) of the hydrolysis reaction
increased when higher concentrations of the substrate p-
nitrophenol butyrate ( p-NPB) were used. According to the
Michaelis-Menten equation, Vmax was 55.8±2.0 U nmol –1
Sub1 (2,361±84.5 U mg–1 Sub1) and Km was 0.57±0.04 mM
p-NPB.
Effects of the Sub1 esterase on polymers
Sub1 was shown to hydrolyze suberin and cutin, releasing
1.22±0.06 and 2.65±0.18 nmol of fatty acids (palmitic acid
equivalent) μg –1 Sub1 from these polymers, respectively ,
after 20 d of the incubation. The ability of Sub1 to degrade
cutin and suberin appeared to be stable over the experimen‐
tal time course at room temperature because the amounts of
fatty acids released in the incubation medium correlated
with time (P<0.0001; Fig. 6).

and C12) in the absence or presence of Triton X-100 (0.5%). Data
shown are the mean±SD of three replicates. Bar values accompanied
by the same letter are not significantly different.
On the other hand, the release of TA showed that the
Sub1 esterase also had the ability to hydrolyze the synthetic
substrate PET. The addition of Triton X-100 to the reaction
mix enhanced the hydrolysis of PET by ca. 2.6-fold
(P<0.0001, t-test; Fig. 7A) after 10 and 15 d of the incuba‐
tion. The esterase activity of Sub1 on PET, in the presence
of Triton X-100, increased over the incubation time because
the amount of TA released during the degradation of PET
correlated with the incubation time ( P<0.0001; Fig. 7B).
The enzyme Sub1 showed high stability at 37°C over the
test period (20 d) because the concentration of TA released
in the incubation medium linearly correlated with time
(r2=0.9874). However, the stability of Sub1 at 50°C fit a
non-linear curve (r2=0.9667).

Discussion
S. scabies may colonize potato tuber surfaces and is able
to directly penetrate potato cells (Loria et al., 2003). Previ‐
ous studies proposed that its entry into potato tuber tissues
may be facilitated by the production of esterases that

acids in the incubation medium. Data are the means±SD of four

degrade suberin present in the potato periderm (McQueen
and Schottel, 1987; Beauséjour et al., 1999; Komeil et al.,
2013). Although suberin degradation has not yet been exam‐
ined in detail, some fungal cutinases exhibit activity towards
suberin (Kontkanen et al., 2009). The protein Sub1 is part of
the S. scabies secretome when this bacterium is grown in the
presence of suberin (Beaulieu et al. , 2016) and the sub1
gene is induced in the presence of suberin (Komeil et al. ,
2013). This study predicted that Sub1 was a cutinase due to
its high sequence homology with other cutinases of fungal
origin. The present results confirm this prediction because
Sub1 exhibited the ability to hydrolyze both cutin and suberin.
In the present study, the heterologous production of the S.
scabies Sub1 protein was successfully achieved in E. coli .
Other studies also reported the heterologous expression of
bacterial esterases in E. coli (Chen et al. , 2008; Su et al.,
2013; Ribitsch et al., 2015). The molecular weight of His-
tagged Sub1 was estimated herein to be 25 kDa, which is
consistent with the predicted molecular weight of mature
Sub1 (18.7 kDa) plus the His-tag (4.9 kDa). Therefore, the
molecular weight of Sub1 appears to be less than that of
most bacterial cutinases, such as Tfu-0882 and Tfu-0883

from Thermobifida fusca (29 kDa; Chen et al., 2008), but is
closer to those of fungal plant pathogen cutinases, such as
CcCUT1 from C. cinerea (18.8 kDa; Kontkanen et al. ,
2009) and CutA from Botrytis cinerea (18 kDa; van der
Vlugt-Bergmans et al., 1997).
As reported with other cutinases, purified Sub1 also has
the ability to hydrolyze p-nitrophenyl esters. Sub1 was more
active on p-nitrophenyl esters with short carbon chains, i.e.
p-nitrophenyl butyrate (p-NPB, C4) and p-nitrophenyl octa‐
noate (C8), than on those with longer carbon chains (C10
and C12). Other microbial cutinases have also been reported
to be more active on p-nitrophenyl esters harboring short
fatty acid chains (Purdy and Kolattukudy, 1973; Kontkanen
et al., 2009). Using p-nitrophenyl butyrate as a substrate, the
activity of Sub1 followed a typical Michaelis-Menten curve.
The Sub1 enzyme showed affinity towards this substrate
(Km=5.7 10 –4 M), similar to two cutinases of Fusarium
solani pv. pisi with Km of 3.5 10 –4 M and of 7.5 10 –4 M,
respectively (Kolattukudy et al., 1981). Although strepto‐
mycetes such as S. scabies and filamentous fungi belong to
different kingdoms, they exhibit similar lifestyles and often
share the same ecological niches (Wösten and Willey ,
2000). Their mycelia colonize various organic polymers and
produce large amounts of extracellular enzymes to retrieve
nutrients from these substrates. Therefore, similarities
between Sub1 and fungal cutinases may reflect an adapta‐
tion to a similar lifestyle. Other Streptomyces extracellular
enzymes, e.g. chitosanases from the GH75 family, are
encoded by genes that are also mainly represented in fungal
and actinobacterial genomes (Lacombe-Harvey et al., 2018).
Sub1 has high similarity, at the amino acid level, to the
cutinase CUT1 from F . solani, which is able to degrade sub‐
erin. Similar to CUT1, the present results indicated that
Sub1 exhibits hydrolysis activity on suberin. However, Sub1
and CUT1 showed higher activity on cutin than on suberin,
even though S. scabies and F . solaniboth infect and colo‐
nize potato tubers and are, thus, frequently in contact with
potato suberin (Fiers et al., 2012). This finding indicates
that the presence of aromatic compounds in suberin also
contributes to its recalcitrant nature (Faber, 1979). However,
difficulties are associated with comparing the efficacy of
Sub1 with fungal cutinases because the methods used to
monitor cutinase activity differ between studies (van der
Vlugt-Bergmans et al., 1997; Kontkanen et al., 2009; Chen
et al., 2013; the present results). To the best of our knowl‐
edge, Sub1 represents the first bacterial cutinase for which
activity towards suberin has been demonstrated. Based on
the ecological niche of this pathogen, in which potato
tubers, but not the aerial part of the plant, are infected, sub ‐
erin most likely represents an important substrate for Sub1
in the environment and, consequently, Sub1 may be desig‐
nated as a suberinase. While the ability to degrade cutin has
been shown to be important for the pathogenicity of various
fungal plant pathogens (Feng et al. , 2011; Wang et al. ,
2017), there is no evidence to show that the ability to
degrade suberin represents an asset in the infection process
of plant pathogens. The Sub1 protein does not appear to be
an essential pathogenicity factor for S. scabies because the
sub1 gene has not been detected in other common scab-
inducing Streptomyces species, such as S. acidiscabies
(Komeil et al., 2013), and its primary benefit may involve
the degradation of refractory polymers. However, Sub1 may
confer an advantage to S. scabies over other common scab-
inducing species by facilitating direct penetration, tuber col‐
onization, and persistence in potato tuber debris.
While Sub1 is conserved in only a few streptomycetes, it
presents high homology not only with some fungal cuti‐
nases, but also with cutinase-like enzymes from animal
pathogenic mycobacteria (Komeil et al., 2013). These bacte‐
ria do not encounter cutin or suberin in their environment;
however, cutinases were identified as multifunctional
enzymes that act on phospholipids, polysorbates, triacylgly‐
cerols, and triolein (Schué et al. , 2010; Monu and Meena,
2016). As multifunctional enzymes, cutinases have a num‐
ber of applications in industry (Carvalho et al., 1998). In the
present study, the effects of Sub1 on PET, a synthetic poly‐
ester that is widely used in the production of textiles, were
tested. Sub1 was shown to degrade PET because the quan‐
tity of terephthalic acid released from the synthetic polymer
depended on the enzyme concentration and increased over
the incubation time. The enzyme Sub1 maintained its activ‐
ity at 37°C for at least 20 d, showing that it is stable, as has
been demonstrated for other cutinases (Dutta et al., 2009).
Due to their functional properties, cutinases are considered
to be a link between esterases and lipases (Chahinian et al.,
2002). The addition of a non-ionic surfactant, such as Tri‐
ton, into a reaction mix generally promotes the activity of
lipases, but does not affect the activity of most cutinases.
For example, the presence of Triton in the reaction mix
increased the hydrolysis of polyester bis-(benzoyloxyethyl)
terephthalate (3PET) by a lipase secreted by Thermomyces
lanuginosus, whereas it did not exert any effect when the
same substrate was exposed to cutinases secreted by T. fusca
and F . solani(Eberl et al., 2009). Triton increases the activ‐
ity of lipases by promoting the opening of a peptide lid
located over the active site of the enzyme; such a lid is not
present in cutinases (Eberl et al. , 2009). As observed with
most cutinases, the addition of Triton X-100 did not affect
cutin hydrolysis by Sub1 (data not shown). Nevertheless,
the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl esters and of PET by Sub1
was enhanced in the presence of Triton.
The present study established that the sub1 gene of S.
scabies encodes a protein acting as a suberinase. The versa‐
tility of Sub1 may also be considered for adoption in indus‐
trial applications. A cutinase-like enzyme has recently
attracted global public attention. This enzyme, originally
characterized in the bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6,
is able to degrade PET and has been reclassified as a PETase
(Yoshida et al., 2016). Thereafter, Austin et al. (2018) intro‐
duced modifications to the binding cleft of this enzyme and
produced an engineered PETase with better plastic-
degrading properties than the native enzyme. The current
need for enzymes with the ability to degrade refractory pol‐
ymers of anthropic origin makes further studies on the capa‐
bilities of Sub1 very relevant.
