Abstract High-throughput screeni ng detected transami-
nases (TAs) and monoamine oxidases (MAOs) in fungi
by applying a fluorogenic probe. Strains F026, F037,
F041, F053, and F057 showed the highest enzymatic con-
versions (31, 60, 30, 40, and 32%, respectively) and
where evaluated for their ability to transform piperidines.
Strain F053 ( Neopestalotiopsis sp. CBMAI 2030) re-
vealed unusual enzymatic activity to deracemize 2-meth-
yl-6-alkylpiperidines. Neopestalotiopsis sp. CBMAI 2030
was capable to convert 2-methyl-6-propylpiperidine, 2-
methyl-6-butylpiperidine, and 2-methyl-6-
pentylpiperidine in piperideine with 11, 14, and 24% con-
version, respectively. The activity was enhanced by culti-
vating the fungus with 2-methyl-6-pentylpiperidine (38%
conversion and 73% ee).

Introduction
Chiral amines are often biologically active and synthetically
demanding chiral intermediates with applications in pharma-
ceutical and agrochemical industries (Koszelewski et al. 2010;
Carr et al. 2003). Chiral 2-methyl-6-alkylpiperidine moieties
are present in solenopsin alkaloids, which are the main com-
ponents in Solenopsis ant venom. These compounds usually
d i s p l a ya n( 2R,6S) absolute configuration (Pianaro et al.
2012), and their proposed biosynthetic pathway suggests the
participation of transaminases (TAs) and imino reductases
(IREDs) in the definition of the chiral centers (Leclercq et al.
1996). Nowadays, these stereo-controlled processes can be
reproduced in lab by using the same enzyme families (TA-
IRED cascade) and diketones as substrates (France et al.
2016). Additionally, a similar cascade can also be performed
by monoamine oxidases from Aspergillus niger (MAO-N)
and ω-transaminases (TA) (Reilly et al.2014). These enzymes
are cofactor-dependent; TAs depend on pyridoxal 5 ′-phos-
phate (PLP) and MAO-N on flavin mononucleotide (FMN).
TAs catalyze transamination, transferring amino groups
from amines or amino acids to amine acceptors, ketones,
or α-ketoacids, and are relevant to amino acid production
in microorganisms and animals (Koszelewski et al. 2010;
Hwang and Kim 2004). MAOs have been detected in
many organisms (Atkin et al. 2008a, b) and are responsi-
ble for the oxidative deamination of monoamines,
resulting in hydrogen peroxide and imine formation to
produce ketones or aldehydes (Atkin et al. 2008a, b).
In microorganisms, these enzymatic activities can be de-
tected by applying high-throughput screening (HTS) assays.
Most HTS methodologies detect signals from a fluorogenic or
chromogenic probe in 96-well microplates, which reveal that

the enzymatic reaction occurred (Reymond 2008). Assays de-
tecting fluorescent signals are more sensitive and provide a
linear response to the reaction progress without interference of
colored products (Reymond 2006).
Here, we used HTS and a fluorogenic probe recently
suggested by Lu et al. ( 2008) to monitor MAO and/or TA
enzymes in fungi available from LaBioChem in house culture
collection, UNICAMP. The enzymatic activity of the best
strain was validated in th e deracemization of 2,6-
dialkylpiperidines.
Material and methods
General methods
Commercially available reagents and solvents were acquired
from Sigma-Aldrich, Acros, or Synth, and purified following
standard procedures (Perrin et al.1980) when necessary. Merck
silica gel 60 (230–4 0 0m e s hA S T M )w a su s e df o rBflash^ col-
umn chromatography, and thin-layer chromatography was per-
formed using Merck silica gel 60 F
254 on aluminum foils, re-
vealed by UV 254 nm lamp irradiation. Visualization spray re-
agents for TLC were either 10% w/v phosphomolybdic acid
in ethanol or p-anisaldehyde, H2SO4, acetic acid in ethanol
(1:2:1:100 v/v), or Dragendorff ’s solution containing
bismuth(III)nitrate (0.85 g), tartaric acid (10 g), and potassium
iodide (16 g) in distilled water (80 mL). 1HN M R
(600.17 MHz) and13C NMR (150.91 MHz) were acquired with
a Bruker Avance III 600 (B 0 = 14.1 T), and 1HN M R
(400.13 MHz) and13C NMR (100.63 MHz) were acquired with
a Bruker Avance III 400 ( B0 = 9.4 T). Deuterated chloroform
(CDCl3; 7.23 ppm), deuterated methanol (CD 3OD; 3.35 and
4.78 ppm), and tetramethylsilane (TMS; 0.0 ppm) were used
as a solvent and internal reference. Chemical shifts were
expressed in δ (ppm) and the coupling constants ( J)i nH e r t z
(Hz). The GC-MS analyses were performed in an Agilent 6890
Series chromatograph coupled to a Hewlett-Packard 5973 mass
spectrometer with an electron ionization source (EI) operating
at 70 eV , and equipped with a fused silica capillary column HP
5-MS (30 m × 0.25 mm × 0.25 μm) with 5%
phenylmethylsiloxane. Helium was used as carrier gas
(1 mL min
−1), and the injector temperature was set to 250 °C,
detector temperature to 230 °C, and an injection volume of
1.0 μL in splitless mode was used. The initial oven temperature
was 50 °C, increasing at 20 °C min −1 to 290 °C. The diastereo-
meric discrimination of compound 11 was achieved using an
Agilent 6850 chromatograph equipped with a flame ionization
detector and a fused silica capillary column Chrompack® with
chiral phase Chirasil- β -cyclodextrin
( 2 5m×0 . 2 5m m×0 . 2 5 μm), H
2 carrier gas (2 mL min −1),
injector at 180 °C, detector at 150 °C, and splitless mode injec-
tions of 1.0 μL. Mass spectrometry with electrospray ionization
(ESI-MS) was performed using a Waters Quattro Micro TM
API spectrometer. Samples of compounds 1 and 1d (10 μg/
mL in methanol) were applied by direct infusion using a
50 μLm i n−1,a n da0 . 1m Lm i n−1 flux of 0.1% v/v formic acid
in methanol was used. Nitrogen was the nebulizing gas, the
analyses were performed in the positive mode, and the param-
eters were as follow: capillary voltage 3 kV, cone voltage 25 V,
extractor voltage 3 V, RF lens voltage 0.5 V, source temperature
150 °C, desolvation temperature 200 °C, desolving gas flux
800 L/h, and gas flux at the cone 50 L/h. Hydrogenations were
performed using a Parr 3926 shaker hydrogenation apparatus.
Microorganisms
Microorganisms (MOs) from our private collection were used
in HTS stage, and the hit F053 was identified as
Neopestalotiopsis sp. and deposited at CBMAI (Brazilian
Collection of Microorganisms from the Environment and
Industry) under the code name CBMAI 2030. For the HTS
assays, the MOs were inoculated on Petri dishes containing
malt extract agar (MEA) culture medium and incubated for
72 h at 30 °C. The cells were suspended in 20 mM borate
buffer pH 7.4 to a final concentration of 1 mg mL
−1.
For the biotransformations, MOs were transferred to an
Erlenmeyer flask (500 mL) containing 200 mL of malt extract
(ME) culture medium and incubated at 30 °C and 200 rpm for
48 h. The cells were harvested by filtration under vacuum and
used direct in the assays.
HTS assays
Screening with whole cells were performed using 7-(3-
aminopropoxy)coumarin (probe 1) as fluorogenic substrate
and following a previously optimized protocol described by
Bicalho et al. ( 2004). The HTS assays were developed in 96-
well polypropylene microtiter plates in quadruplicate, and re-
action controls in duplicate.
Assay (A): 10 μL of 2 mM probe 1 solution in
water:acetonitrile (1:1 v/v), 80 μL of 5.0 mg mL
−1 BSA
in 20 mM borate buffer pH 7.4, 10 μLo f2 0m Mb o r a t e
buffer pH 7.4, and 100 μL of 1.0 mg mL −1 cell suspen-
sion in 20 mM borate buffer pH 7.4.
Negative control (NC): 10 μL of 2 mM probe 1 solution
in water:acetonitrile (1:1 v/v), 80 μL of 5.0 mg mL −1
BSA solution in 20 mM borate buffer pH 7.4, and
110 μL of 20 mM borate buffer pH 7.4.
Positive control (PC): 10 μL of 2 mM umbelliferone
solution in water:acetonitrile (1:1 v/v), 80 μLo f
5.0 mg mL
−1 BSA solution in 20 mM borate buffer
pH 7.4, 10 μL of 20 mM borate buffer pH 7.4, and
100 μL of 1.0 mg mL −1 cell suspension in 20 mM
borate buffer pH 7.4.

The microtiter plates were incubated at 30 °C and 200 rpm.
The fluorescent signal was monitored using a PerkinElmer
EnSpire microtiter plate reader at 0, 24, 48, 72, and 96 h (ex-
citation wavelength λ
ex = 360 nm and emission wavelength
λem = 460 nm).
The results were expressed as percentage of conversion (%)
applying Eq. 1. All results were averaged and conversion
values are estimated, taking the positive control as 100%.

glacial acetic acid (40 mL) with Pt/C 10% (100 mg) were
hydrogenated at 60 bar H
2 and 500 rpm for 48 h using a
Parr 3926 shaker hydrogenator. The reaction mixture was fil-
tered over a Celite 545 pad (2 g) and eluted with methanol
(50 mL). Solvent evaporation yielded the crude product,
which was purified by silica gel column chromatography, elut-
ed with methanol, to yield 0.5, 0.48, and 0.5 g of 6, 7,a n d8 ,
respectively, as yellow oils in 99, 98, and 99% yield,
respectively.

Fungal identification
Molecular analysis
DNA extraction was performed following the protocol de-
scribed by Raeder and Broda ( 1985). The isolate was screened
for ITS loci using the ITS1 and ITS4 primers (White et al.
1990). Amplification reactions were performed using PCR
with genomic DNA as a template, and the conditions were
set as follows: an initial denaturation temperature of 94 °C
for 2 min, 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 1 min, primer
annealing at 55 °C for 1 min, primer extension at 72 °C for
3 min, and a final extension step at 72 °C for 3 min and 4 °C.
Amplicons were purified using GFX PCR DNA and a Gel
Band Purification Kit (GE Healthcare) and sequenced with
BigDye Terminator (Life Technologies, USA) and an
ABI3500XL Series Sequencer (Applied Biosystems) accord-
ing to the manufacturer ’s instructions. The BioEdit Sequence
Alignment Editor v. 7.0.5.3 (Hall 1999) was used to generate
the consensus sequence, which was compared against the
GenBank nucleotide database ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)
and CBS ( http://www.cbs.knaw.nl /). The most similar
sequences were selected, combined with the sequence from
the isolate. After alignment using the CLUSTAL X software
(Thompson et al. 1994), a phylogenetic tree was generated
with MEGA software version 4.0 (Tamura et al. 2007).
Neighbor-joining criteria (Saitou and Nei 1987)w e r eu s e di n
the analysis, and bootstrap values were calculated for under
1000 pseudoreplicates.
Morphological analysis
A single-cell preparation was used to ensure the purity of the
fungal culture as follows: after a strongly diluted spore sus-
pension was prepared in distilled water, 100 μL was trans-
ferred to a Neubauer chamber to count the number of colony

forming units (CFUs). Further dilutions were performed until
no more than 5 CFU was found. Then, 100 μL of the final
diluted suspension was streaked onto a potato dextrose agar
(PDA) layer on Petri dishes using a Drigalski spatula. The
plates were incubated at 25 °C until isolated growing colonies
were observed. Later, microscopic examination was based on
slide preparation by adding a drop of Lactophenol Cotton
Blue to a microscope slide and subsequently transferring the
fungal material from the culture (Crous et al. 2009).
The ITS sequence of Neopestalotiopsissp. CBMAI 2030
was deposited at GenBank with accession number KY696576.
Results
MAO/TA high-throughput screening
The fluorogenic probe 7-(3-aminopropoxy)coumarin ( 1)w a s
synthesized in 83% yield and was successfully applied to the
high-throughput screening of 39 fungi in order to quickly
select the best strain for TA and/or MAO enzymatic activities
(Fig. 1).
The MAO/TA HTS results revealed that 25 fungi catalyzed
the oxidative deamination or transamination of probe 1 at a
relatively low conversion (Table 1). On the other hand, the
fluorogenic probe was converted into umbelliferone with
30–60% conversion by five fungi (Table 1): F026, F037,
F041, F053, and F057. These microorganisms were selected
for further investigation regarding the biotransformation of
2,6-dialkylpiperidines.
Synthesis and biotransformation
of 2-methyl-6-alkylpiperidines
2-Methyl-6-propylpiperidine (6), 2-methyl-6-butylpiperidine
(7), and 2-methyl-6-pentylpiperidine ( 8) were synthesized,
as depicted in Fig. 2, aiming at confirming possible MAO
activities observed in the HTS experiments.
The synthetic route for 6, 7,a n d8 (Fig. 3) was based on the
synthesis of racemic solenopsins (Pianaro et al. 2012). The

2,6-lutidin carbanion ( 10) was obtained by treating lutidine
with butyl lithium, which promptly reacted with the appropri-
ate alkyl halide to produce 2-methyl-6-alkylpiridines 6b, 7b,
and 8b. In the second step, the pyridines were hydrogenated in
the presence of 10% Pt/C to produce piperidines 6, 7,a n d 8.
All products and intermediates were fully characterized.
Among the five fungi selected, only F053 showed good
M A Oa c t i v i t yw h e nt e s t e dw i t h6, 7,a n d8 . The remaining
microorganisms showed no activity with these piperidines
(Table 2).
The piperideines 6a, 7a,a n d8a were detected in the reac-
tion media after 7 days with 11, 14, and 24% conversion,
respectively. Using mass spectrometry, 6a, 7a,a n d8a were
confirmed, by a characteristic fragment at m/z 111 that is
rationalized by hydrogen rearrangement through a six-
membered ring intermediate, as in the McLafferty rear-
rangement (McLafferty and Turecek 1993)( F i g . 4).
Additionally, elongation of the 2-alkyl chain length seems
to increase the conversion efficiency of the piperidine into
piperideine. Therefore, piperideine 8a formation probably re-
lies on a better acceptance of 8 by fungus F053, and this
substrate was well suited for the investigation of evolutionary
strategies in a laboratory setting, which is usually applied to
bacteria with a short generation time. The experimental evo-
lution of Escherichia coli for 40,000 generations in a glucose-
limited medium is one of the best-known examples in the field
(Bachmann et al. 2012). The present example is the evolution
of the F053 fungus toward piperidine 8, and each evolution
cycle involved 7 to 15 days. The adaptation lasted three gen-
erations to reach a 38% of 8a. The third generation produced
8a in higher conversion (38%) and in shorter time (7 days). No
further increase was obtained in future generations.
Determination of enantiomeric excess of either 8 or 8a was
not an easy task as pure 8 or 8a was not commercially avail-
able. The strategy was to use the methodology previously
applied by Pianaro et al. ( 2012) to reveal the absolute config-
uration of the solenopsins. Racemic cis and trans 8 were
tr
ifluoroacetylated (11) and the mixture was analyzed using
chiral GC-FID with a β-cyclodextrin column revealing that 8
was mainly composed of cis isomers. This was confirmed by
1H NMR analyses, with hydrogen H-2 and H-6 chemical
shifts as diagnostic (H-6 2.88 ppm and H-2 3.05 ppm) com-
pared to those of the solenopsins (2-methyl-6-
undecylpiperidines,cis H-6 2.85 ppm and H-2 3.03 ppm, trans
H-6 3.27 ppm and H-2 3.51 ppm) (Pianaro et al. 2012). The
cis-2-methyl-6-pentylpiperidine isomers 2R,6S (6.93 min) and
2S,6R (7.10 min) were eluted after small amounts of trans
isomers 2 R,6R (6.53 min) and 2 S,6S (6.68 min). The chro-
matographic separation of the trifluoroacetyl derivatives of
the 2-methyl-6-pentylpiperidines ( 11) on the chiral column
was similar to Pianaro ’s et al. ( 2012) (Fig. 5a). Therefore,
analysis of the biotransformation of 8 by fungus F053 re-
vealed an enantiomeric excess of 73% for the cis (2S,6R)-2-
methyl-6-pentylpiperidine (Fig. 5ba n dT a b l e3).
Fungal analysis—identification
Molecular analysis of the consensus sequence of the F053
strain indicated that the isolate belongs to the genus
Neopestalotiopsis. However, no data enabled identifica-
tion at the species level. Mic roscopic observations on
PDA culture medium revealed the presence of globose-
subglobose pycnidial conidiomatas and discrete
conidiogenous cells. Conidia are straight to slightly
curved, 4-septate, thin-walled, versicolorous median cells.
Hyaline cylindrical apical cel ls with tubular appendages
(branched or not) and basal single, tubular, unbranched
appendages were also present. Based on molecular and
morphological aspects, the F053 strain was identified as
Neopestalotiopsis sp. (Maharachchikumbura et al. 2014).
Neopestalotiopsis commonly occurs as a plant pathogen
and together with Pestalotiopsis represents a fungal group
known to produce a wide range of chemically novel metabo-
lites (Maharachchikumbura et al. 2014). These species have
been recovered from soil, polluted stream water, wood, paper,
fabric, and wool (Guba 1961) and are associated with human
and animal infections (Sutton 1999).
Discussion
HTS methods are quick to conduct millions of chemical
or pharmacological tests. The results of these experi-
ments provide starting points for the understanding of bio-
chemical processes in biology and for the detection of enzy-
matic activities (Reetz2002). Among the available HTS meth-
odologies, those carried out in 96-well microplates with mod-
ified substrates (fluorogenic probes) to reveal the enzymatic

reaction by signals of the fluorophore products are the most
common (Reymond 2006). These assays provide quantitative
results and can be automated by the use of microplate readers
for data acquisition.
Due to its successful application to human MAO-A and
MAO-B enzymatic activities (Lu et al. 2008 ), 7-(3-
aminopropoxy)coumarin ( 1) was selected as a fluorogenic
probe for MAO enzymatic screening in microorganisms,
based on our previous experience with whole-cell HTS exper-
iments and analogous probes (Gonçalves and Marsaioli 2014;
Lima et al. 2015; Mantovani et al. 2010). In this work, probe 1
was effective on selecting five fungi with possible MAO ac-
tivity. However, by using this fluorogenic assay, it is not pos-
sible to differentiate between MAO and TA activities. As
shown in Fig. 1,p r o b e1 produces, either by enzymatic oxi-
dative deamination (MAO) or transamination (TA), the same
aldehyde product ( 3), which undergoes spontaneous β-
elimination releasing the fluorescent umbelliferyl anion ( 4).
Consequently, in order to overcome this issue, we per-
formed biotransformation experiments using 2-methyl-6-
alkylpiperidines as substrates to confirm the MAO activities
observed in the five fungi selected by HTS. Biotransformation
of these compounds must take place only by MAOs, produc-
ing the respective piperideines, as TAs do not catalyze reac-
tions involving secondary and tertiary amines.
Using this approach, a monoamine oxidase was confirmed
in Neopestalotiopsis sp. CBMAI 2030 (isolate F053), which
transformed all evaluated piperidines and, on its best,
deracemized 2-methyl-6-pentylpiperidine into (2 R,6S)-2-
methyl-6-pentylpiperidine in 38% conversion and 73% ee
within 7 days. The piperideine enantiomeric excess was not
accessed due to a lack of standards and enantiomeric discrim-
ination methods. These results also attested the efficiency of
probe 1 and the HTS technique in detecting new MAOs.
For years, 2-methyl-6-alkylpiperidines are the subject
of research in our group. These alkaloids are also known
as solenopsins because they are the main constituents of
Solenopsis ant venom. The two stereocenters of the
solenopsins allow the existe nce of four stereoisomers:
trans( 2R,6R or 2S,6S)a n d cis (2R,6S or 2S,6R), and the
ratio of these diastereoisomers in the venom composition
varies between Solenopsis worker ants and queens
(Pianaro et al. 2012).
Concerning biocatalytic synthesis, Reilly et al. ( 2014)d e -
veloped a chemo-enzymatic process for the production of chi-
ral 2,5-disubstituted pyrrolid ines using transaminase and
monoamine oxidase from A. niger (MAO-N), obtaining ex-
cellent enantioselectivity and diastereoselectivity. With the ac-
tivity showed by Neopestalotiopsis sp. CBMAI 2030, this
chemo-enzymatic process could be applied to give access to
enantiomerically pure 2,6-disubstituted piperidines
(solenopsins), shading light into the role of the absolute con-
figuration and the ant communication inside the nests.
Fu
ngal monoamine oxidase from A. niger and its variants
are the main monoamine oxidases used as biocatalyst for the
deracemization of secondary and tertiary amines (Carr et al.
2005;D u n s m o r ee ta l .2006). The wild-type MAO-N is most
active on simple straight-chain amines and shows poor activ-
ity with cyclic amines, which demanded several rounds of
direct evolution to enhance its substrate acceptance (Carr
et al. 2003). This characteristic creates the opportunity to
search for new wild-type MAOs with distinct activity scope.
Therefore, this report adds a new enzyme to the known MAO
panel and the gene and heterologous expression of this novel
MAO is under investigation.
