The crystal structures of the tri-functional
Chloroflexus aurantiacus and bi-functional
Rhodobacter sphaeroides malyl-CoA lyases and
comparison with CitE-like superfamily enzymes
and malate synthases
Jan Zarzycki1 and Cheryl A Kerfeld1,2,3,4*
Abstract
Background: Malyl-CoA lyase (MCL) is a promiscuous carbon-carbon bond lyase that catalyzes the reversible cleav-
age of structurally related Coenzyme A (CoA) thioesters. This enzyme plays a crucial, multifunctional role in the 3-
hydroxypropionate bi-cycle for autotrophic CO
2 fixation in Chloroflexus aurantiacus. A second, phylogenetically dis-
tinct MCL fromRhodobacter sphaeroides is involved in the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway for acetate assimilation. Both
MCLs belong to the large superfamily of CitE-like enzymes, which includes the name-givingβ-subunit of citrate
lyase (CitE), malyl-CoA thioesterases and other enzymes of unknown physiological function. The CitE-like enzyme
superfamily also bears sequence and structural resemblance to the malate synthases. All of these different enzymes
share highly conserved catalytic residues, although they catalyze distinctly different reactions: C-C bond formation
and cleavage, thioester hydrolysis, or both (the malate synthases).
Results: Here we report the first crystal structures of MCLs from two different phylogenetic subgroups in apo- and
substrate-bound forms. Both theC. aurantiacus and the R. sphaeroides MCL contain elaborations on the canonical
β
8/α8 TIM barrel fold and form hexameric assemblies. Upon ligand binding, changes in the C-terminal domains of
the MCLs result in closing of the active site, with the C-terminal domain of one monomer forming a lid over and
contributing side chains to the active site of the adjacent monomer. The distinctive features of the two MCL
subgroups were compared to known structures of other CitE-like superfamily enzymes and to malate synthases,
providing insight into the structural subtleties that underlie the functional versatility of these enzymes.
Conclusions: Although the C. aurantiacus and the R. sphaeroides MCLs have divergent primary structures (~37%
identical), their tertiary and quaternary structures are very similar. It can be assumed that the C-C bond formation
catalyzed by the MCLs occurs as proposed for malate synthases. However, a comparison of the two MCL structures
with known malate synthases raised the question why the MCLs are not also able to hydrolyze CoA thioester bonds.
Our results suggest the previously proposed reaction mechanism for malate synthases may be incomplete or not
entirely correct. Further studies involving site-directed mutagenesis based on these structures may be required to
solve this puzzling question.

Background
Enzymes of the CitE-like superfamily are widely distrib-
uted among Bacteria, but can also be found in Archaea
and Eukaryota. However, only very few of these enzymes
have been biochemically characterized. The true CitE is
the β-subunit of the ATP-independent citrate lyase,
which consists of three different subunits [1,2] and the
corresponding genes are part of the citCDEF(X)G op-
eron [3,4]. The ATP-independent citrate lyase is only
found in prokaryotes and is important for the anaerobic
fermentation of citrate [1]. Itsγ-subunit (CitD) functions
as an acyl-carrier-protein (ACP) and contains a CoA
derivative as prosthetic group [4-6]. The α-subunit
(CitF) functions as an acyl-transferase and is responsible
for the formation of a citryl-ACP intermediate [2]. CitE,
the β-subunit, cleaves the citryl-moiety into oxaloacetate
and acetyl-ACP (Figure 1) [2]. Other CitE-like enzymes
are encoded by “stand alone” genes or genes that are
part of clusters unrelated to the citrate lyase operon [7].
Examples of CitE-like enzymes that have been biochem-
ically characterized use free acyl-CoA thioesters instead
of ACPs as substrates, including the malyl-CoA lyases
[8-12], a malyl-CoA thioesterase [11], and haloarchaeal
forms of a malate synthases [13-15]. All of these
enzymes require divalent metal ions, Mg2+ or Mn2+, for
catalysis.
Malyl-CoA lyases are promiscuous enzymes that
accept a variety of substrates and can catalyze the
reversible aldol condensation of CoA thioesters like
acetyl-CoA or propionyl-CoA with 2-oxoacids like glyox-
ylate or pyruvate [9-11]. MCLs are known to function in
different pathways of central carbon metabolism in

Bacteria and Haloarchaea. The very first MCLs were de-
scribed in Methylobacterium extorquens AM1 (formerly
Pseudomonas sp. AM1) [12,16] andAminobacter amino-
vorans (formerly Pseudomonas sp. MA) [17]. InMethylo-
bacterium an MCL takes part in the serine cycle, which
allows the assimilation of C1 compounds such as metha-
nol, formate, and formaldehyde into biomass [18]. In this
case, MCL is responsible for the cleavage of (S)-malyl-
CoA into glyoxylate and acetyl-CoA [16].
Subsequently it was discovered that inC. aurantiacus
an MCL (MCLC) catalyzes three different steps in the 3-
hydroxypropionate bi-cycle for autotrophic CO2 fixation
[9,10,19]. This tri-functional enzyme cleaves (S)-malyl-
CoA into acetyl-CoA and glyoxylate, combines glyoxy-
late with propionyl-CoA to β-methylmalyl-CoA, and
finally also cleaves (S)-citramalyl-CoA into acetyl-CoA
and pyruvate (Figure 1). This pathway is garnering
considerable attention for biotechnological applications
[20,21] because it is unique among the known CO
2
fixing pathways in that the constituent enzymes are in-
sensitive to oxygen [10]. Moreover, the whole bi-cyclic
CO
2 fixation strategy is metabolically streamlined; it
comprises 19 chemical reaction steps but involves only
13 enzymes because several multifunctional enzymes are
employed [10]. The tri-functionality of the MCLC un-
derscores its key role for this pathway.
An MCL was also functionally characterized inRhodo-
bacter capsulatus and R. sphaeroides [8,11], which be-
long to a group of organisms that lack isocitrate lyase.
Therefore, they are unable to use the glyoxylate bypass
to assimilate acetyl-CoA or other substrates that enter
central carbon metabolism at the level of acetyl-CoA.
Instead, they use the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway [22] for
the assimilation of acetyl-CoA. In the ethylmalonyl-CoA
pathway, characterized in the R. sphaeroides, the MCL
(MCLR) is bifunctional; it catalyzes the cleavage of β-
methylmalyl-CoA and the s ynthesis of malyl-CoA
[11]. Interestingly, both MCLR and MCLC essentially
catalyze the same reactions, but function in opposite
directions in the ethylma lonyl-CoA pathway and the
3-hydroxypropionate bi-cycl e, respectively (Figure 1).
Furthermore, MCL-like enzymes were found in
Haloarchaea like Haloarcula marismortui, which lacks
isocitrate lyase as well as enzymes that are required to
establish the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway. Nevertheless, it
is still able to grow on acetate as the sole carbon source.
It was recently demonstrated that these organisms em-
ploy yet another unique pathway for acetyl-CoA assimi-
lation, the so called methylaspartate cycle [15]. This
cyclic pathway makes use of two MCL-like enzymes, one
of which seems to be optimized for the cleavage ofβ-
methylmalyl-CoA into propionyl-CoA and glyoxylate
(HaloMCL), whereas the other one acts like a malate
synthase. The crystal structure of the homologous
haloarchaeal malate synthase (HaloMS) fromHaloferax
volcanii was solved recently [23]. Although HaloMS
shows only very low amino acid sequence identity (10 to
23%) to other malate synthases [23], all key catalytic
residues in the active site are conserved.
While several different members of the CitE-like
superfamily of enzymes and the related malate synthases
have been structurally characterized (Table 1, Figure 2),
until now, no structures were available for enzymes of
the phylogenetic subgroups that harbor malyl-CoA ly-
ases. We determined the crystal structures of the phylo-
genetically distinct MCLs (Figure 2) of C. aurantiacus
and R. sphaeroides, with and without bound substrates/
ligands. The two MCLs share the common fold of a cen-
tral TIM-barrel with small elaborations, as well as an
additional C-terminal domain. In both cases the oligo-
meric state constitutes a dimer of trimers. The MCLC,
however, is more compact than the MCLR, with a larger
buried surface area between the two trimers. The tri-
meric assembly itself is a prerequisite for the catalytic
activity of the MCLs as well as other CitE-like enzymes.
This is due to a domain swap of the C-terminal domain
that functions as a lid over the active site of the respect-
ive neighboring subunit. We observed different con-
formational states of this lid domain for both MCLs
concomitant with substrate binding. Structural compari-
son of the MCLs with malate synthases provides hints as
to what governs their substrate specificities and whether
previously postulated reaction mechanisms for malate
synthases also apply to MCLs.
Results
Structure determination of MCLC
The recombinant MCLC was purified from E. coli cell
extracts. During gel filtration MCLC eluted at a molecu-
lar weight of 228 ± 15 kDa. This is consistent with a
previously reported hexameric oligomerization state [9],
because one monomer of the recombinant enzyme has a
calculated molecular weight of 38.4 kDa. Activity of the
purified enzyme was routinely confirmed by a spectro-
photometric assay monitoring the formation of β-
methylmalyl-CoA from propionyl-CoA and glyoxylate
(see Methods).
In the absence of substrates recombinant MCLC crys-
tallized in the orthorhombic space groupP 22
1 21 with
one hexamer per asymmetric unit (AU). The crystals dif-
fracted to a resolution of 2.5 Å and the structure was
solved using the molecular replacement method. The
resulting model (PDB 4L7Z) comprised nearly the full
length of all six polypeptide chains, starting at Arg2 and
ending with Leu348 (native C-terminal). Only 4 to 6
residues were not built in a loop region (residues 210–
215) of each chain due to the lack of sufficient electron
density. As with other members of the CitE-like

All types of known malyl-CoA lyases belong to phylogenitically distinct clusters, respectively. The malyl-CoA thioesterase ofR. sphaeroidesis also member of a

lyase (HaloMCL). The scale bar corresponds to the number of amino acid substitutions per site.

superfamily [7,24] and malate synthases [23,25-29], the
core of the MCLC monomer constitutes aβ8/α8 TIM-
barrel (Figure 3). In addition to the central TIM-barrel
there is a C-terminal domain (starting at Phe287) that
comprises three α-helices of which two are connected
by a β-hairpin (residues 310–317) (Figure 3). This C-
terminal domain extends to the neighboring subunit
(Figure 4).
Soaking attempts with the MCLC substrate propionyl-
CoA resulted in rapid dissolution of the crystals. There-
fore, attempts were made to crystallize MCLC in the
presence of substrates. Using different crystallization
buffers (see Methods) we were able to obtain crystals in
the tetragonal space groupP43,w h e np r o p i o n y l - C o A ,o x -
alate and magnesium ions were present. Oxalate was
chosen instead of glyoxylate because of the structural simi-
larity between the two compounds, and because oxalate
also acts as an inhibitor of malyl-CoA lyase. The crystals
contained one hexamer per AU and diffracted to 2.0 Å.
The resulting structure ( PDB 4L80) comprised the
complete peptide chains for all six subunits with the excep-
tion of residues 211–213 in two of the six chains, as well as
the two C-terminal residues (Gly347 and Leu348) from a
third chain. Interestingly, the C-terminal domain in this
structure was shifted about 16 Å at its extremity (α-carbon
of Gly314) resulting in the closure of the putative active site
of the neighboring subunit (Figure 4). Therefore the C-
terminal domain appears to serve as a flexible lid. More-
over, in all 6 of these putative active sites electron density
was observed that allowed modeling of propionyl-CoA,
oxalate and Mg2+. Notably, the conformational change
of the C-terminal lid domain may explain why the na-
tive crystals dissolved upon soaking with substrate.

Structure determination of MCLR
The recombinant MCLR was also initially crystallized
in the absence of substrates. The crystals grew in space
group P 12 1 1 with one hexamer per AU. During gel
filtration the His 10- t a g g e dM C L Re l u t e dw i t ham o -
lecular weight of 220 ± 15 kDa, consistent with a
hexameric assembly (36.8 kDa per monomer), as was
previously reported [11]. Activity of the purified MCLR
was also routinely confirmed using the spectrophoto-
metric assay. We also verified MCLR ’s ability to
catalyze the reversible formation of citramalyl-CoA
from acetyl-CoA and pyruvate, because that has not
been tested before [11]. MCLR was incubated with
acetyl-CoA in the presence of (200-fold excess) pyru-
vate. The formation of citramalyl-CoA was confirmed
by reversed phase HPLC analysis of the reaction mix-
ture;the reaction reached an equilibrium of about 1 :
2.5 (citramalyl-CoA: acetyl -CoA). For comparison, it
was reported for MCLC that this reaction reaches an
equilibrium of about 150 when pyruvate was used in
only 10-fold excess over acetyl-CoA [10].

MCLR (PDB 4L9Y) is colored in orange. The rmsd between 267 Cα pairs is 0.96 Å. Secondary and tertiary structures are well conserved in both
isoenzymes. The only major difference is in the orientation and lengths of the N-termini. Moreover, one of the helices that form the C-terminal lid
domain is slightly shorter in MCLC compared to MCLR, whereas there is an additional small helix in the C-terminus of MCLC.

Diffraction of the crystals reached a resolution of
2.1 Å and the structure was solved by molecular replace-
ment. In the final model (4L9Y) each chain begins at
Ser2, whereas varying numbers of residues had to be ex-
cluded from the C-termini. Three of the six chains
lacked electron density for the entire C-terminal lid do-
mains and were modeled only to Pro265 or Ser266. For
the other 3 chains it was possible to model the lid
domains with the exception of only the terminal 1, 3,
or 8 residues.
Despite repeated attempts, we were not able to obtain
crystals of an apo-enzyme with electron density simul-
taneously present for all 6 of the C-terminal lid domains.
Notably, of the three lid domains that could be modeled
only two were in the closed conformation. In the other
one the β-hairpin structure that is depicted in Figure 3
was not developed, and the domain was shifted about
8Åa ti t se x t r e m i t y(α-carbon of Gly295). The shift of
the C-terminal lid domain is similar to what was ob-
served for the MCLC structures with and without
bound substrates. Interestingly, in the two subunits
where the lid domains were in the closed conform-
ation, the active sites cont ained electron density that
allowed modeling of glyox ylate molecules together
with magnesium ions. Nevertheless, Mg 2+ could also
be fitted into the 4 open active sites, whereas glyoxy-
late was replaced by water molecules in these subunits.
Although glyoxylate was not intentionally present, it
was likely carried over fromE. coli cell extracts during
enzyme purification.

C-terminal lid domains are completely covered by the lid domain in the open conformation. Therefore, the N-termini seem to limit the vertical
movement of the lid domain. The different orientation and reduced size of the N-termini in MCLR are responsible for an opening in the hexame-
ric assembly that allows access to a central cavity. A similar cavity is also present in MCLC, but the access is obstructed.

Soaking of these crystals with propionyl-CoA resulted
in the additional occupancy of one of the two closed ac-
tive sites with the CoA thioester. Additional soaking at-
tempts resulted either in dissolving crystals or only very
weak electron density for the ligands. Hence, crystals
were grown in the presence of propionyl-CoA, oxalate
and magnesium ions. The new buffer conditions typic-
ally resulted in crystals of the rhombohedral space group
R 3 2 with one monomer per AU. These crystals dif-
fracted to a resolution of 2.2 Å. Although the C-terminal
lid domain could be completely resolved and was in the
closed conformation, the electron density for bound sub-
strates was scant. However, the same crystallization con-
ditions occasionally yielded a second type of crystals in
the hexagonal space groupP 6
1, with one hexamer per
AU. These crystals diffracted to a resolution of 2.0 Å. All
six C-terminal lid domains were resolved and all of the
active sites were in the closed conformation. Each active
site was occupied by Mg
2+, oxalate, and free CoA instead
of propionyl-CoA. The polypeptide chains in the result-
ing model (PDB 4L9Z) comprised all residues from Ser2
or Phe3 through Met315 with only the C-terminal three
residues missing. Electron density for the N-terminal
His
10-tags was also missing for each chain. The statistics
for the two different MCLR crystal structures are given
in Table 3.
Primary and tertiary structure comparison between the
monomers of MCLR and MCLC
Although the amino acid sequence identity between
MCLC and MCLR is relatively low (~ 37%), their tertiary
structures are strongly conserved (Figure 3). The sub-
units of both enzymes comprise a central β
8/α8 TIM-
barrel with some insertions of small secondary structure
elements. Both MCLs have mostly unordered N-termini
(residues 2–29 in MCLC and 2–15 in MCLR), leading to
the first β-strand of the TIM-barrel (Figure 3). However,
the orientation and length of the N-termini differs be-
tween MCLC and MCLR. MCLR has N-terminal His
10-
tag, which could not be modeled due to the lack of
electron density. We cannot discount the possibility that
the His-tags may have had an influence on the orienta-
tion of the N-termini in MCLR.
Another elaboration of the TIM-barrel core common
to both MCL structures is found after the sixthβ-strand
(Figure 4B). This insertion (residues 182–220 in MCLC

leading into an unordered loop that connects to a β-
hairpin loop structure. The corresponding β-strands in
MCLC are connected by a larger hairpin loop that con-
sists of 11 residues (Ala207-Pro217), whereas the corre-
sponding turn in MCLR only comprises Asp192 and
Gly193. These insertion domains appear to be present in
all of the enzymes that cluster together with MCLC or
MCLR in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 2), respectively
(compare HMM-logos in Additional file 1: Figure S1 and
Additional file 2: Figure S2).
In addition to the core TIM-barrel structure there is a
C-terminal lid domain in both MCLs. These lid domains
differ slightly in MCLC (residues 287–348) and MCLR
(residues 264–318), but both comprise two α-helices
that are connected by aβ-hairpin (Figures 3 and 4). In
MCLR the first of the two helices is slightly longer in
comparison to MCLC, whereas MCLC possesses one
additional short helix at the very end of the lid domain.
MCLR and MCLC oligomeric state
Both types of MCLs are hexameric, composed of
dimers of trimers (Figure 4). The average interface areas
between adjacent subunits in the trimers of MCLC and
MCLR (closed conformations) are similar, 2037 Å
2 and
2154 Å2, respectively. The MCLC hexamer appears to be
more compact than the MCLR (Figure 4C) with a calcu-
lated buried surface area at the dimer interface between
two trimers of 4594 Å
2 in MCLC but only 3173 Å2 in
MCLR. The dimer interface between the trimers is ex-
panded in MCLC mostly due its longer N-termini, which
are in a different orientation than in the MCLR struc-
tures. The shorter N-termini in the MCLR hexamer also
allow access to a central cavity between the trimers. A
similar cavity is present in MCLC as well, but it is only
accessible through very narrow pores that seem just
wide enough to allow diffusion of water molecules. It is
not clear if the central cavities in either enzyme serve a
particular function.
The N-terminal amino acid sequence is highly con-
served among the enzymes that cluster together with
MCLC in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 2). In contrast,
the N-terminus is not well conserved among enzymes of
the MCLR cluster. However, the N-termini of both en-
zymes seem to limit the movement of the C-terminal lid
domains in the hexameric assemblies (Figure 4C).

A second distinctive structural feature of the closed
form of both MCLs is that theβ-hairpin (Figures 3 and
4B) of the C-terminal lid domain provides a number of
residues to close the active site. One of these residues
(Asp318 in MCLC and Asp299 in MCLR) is presumed
to take part in the first step of catalysis as proposed for
the reaction mechanism of malate synthases [27,30],
discussed below.
Ligand binding
By crystallizing both types of MCLs in the presence of
propionyl-CoA, oxalate, and Mg2+, we obtained struc-
tures in which all six active sites were closed off by the
C-terminal lid domains of the respective neighboring
subunits. Moreover, the electron density was sufficient
to fit ligands into each active site. The Mg2+ ion was co-
ordinated by glutamate and aspartate residues (MCLC:
Glu157 & Asp184, MCLR: Glu141 & Asp168), as well as
two oxygen atoms from oxalate and the oxygen atoms of
two water molecules (Figure 5). The resulting octahedral
shell around the bound magnesium ion resembles the
ion binding observed in other CitE-like enzymes and dif-
ferent malate synthases [7,23,25,27,28]. The binding of
the CoA-moiety is also very similar for MCLC, MCLR
and the malate synthases. The adenosine moiety of CoA
is fixed in a largely hydrophobic pocket on the surface of
the TIM-barrel with only one or two hydrogen bonds
formed between the adenine ring and carbonyl oxygen
atoms of the protein backbone. In MCLC there is an
additional hydrogen bond formed with the side chain of
His32, a residue conserved only among MCLC related
enzymes. Due to the bent J-like conformation of the
CoA-moiety (Figure 6) an intramolecular hydrogen bond
between the adenosine ring and the hydroxyl-group of
the pantheteine is formed in both MCLs that is also re-
ported for malate synthases [23,25,26]. The phosphate
groups are coordinated by arginine, lysine, or histidine
residues and the pantheteine tail is inserted (threaded) into
the quite narrow and deep active site cavity (Figure 7)
formed in the closed conformation.
In the MCLR crystal structure with all six C-terminal
lid domains modeled, only free CoA (Figure 6C) was
found instead of propionyl-CoA. It is known that CoA
thioesters are more stable under acidic conditions and
become hydrolyzed over time under alkaline conditions.
The pH of the crystallization condition was 7.5, in
contrast to pH 5.5 used to grow the MCLC crystals.
Although we have also grown crystals in the presence of

propionyl-CoA in different, slightly acidic conditions, we
were not able to obtain other structures with bound
propionyl-CoA. However, propionyl-CoA soaking attempts
with the first type of MCLR crystals, which only allowed
the modeling of three of the six C-terminal domains, were
partly successful. These crystals already had magnesium
and glyoxylate present in the two active sites that were in
the closed conformation. After the additional soaking
step, one of these closed active sites was also occupied by
propionyl-CoA (Figures 5B & 8B).
In both MCLC structures (with and without bound
substrates) additional electron density was observed at
the 3-fold rotation axis in each trimer and was modeled
as Tris molecules. These form hydrogen bonds with the
side chain amide oxygens of Gln221 in each subunit of
the trimer, as well as with backbone oxygen atoms of
Asp222. The Tris molecules are buried within the pro-
tein and do not appear to be solvent accessible, which
may indicate that the additional insertion domain (resi-
dues 182–220) found after the sixth β-strand of the
TIM-barrel is able to undergo a conformational change.
Discussion
The structures of MCLC and MCLR and comparison to
structures of malate synthases and CitE-like family
enzymes
The malyl-CoA lyase structures reported here provide
the first structures of two subgroups of the CitE-like
superfamily of enzymes (Figure 2). Both MCLC and
MCLR constitute dimers of trimers as their oligomeric
state. The structures suggest that monomers of MCLC
and MCLR cannot be catalytically active, because the

like conformations in the structures of MCLC and MCLR. Intramolecular hydrogen bonds between the adenosine rings and the pantetheine tails

C-terminal lid domain of each subunit in the trimer
stretches out to the neighboring one and contributes ac-
tive site residues. This is in contrast to the malate
synthases of type A and G, which are structurally and
functionally monomeric. Interestingly, the HaloMS was
reported to have a trimeric or hexameric (dimer of tri-
mers) assembly [23] as well. Therefore the HaloMS may
be evolutionarily more closely related to the malyl-CoA ly-
ases and other enzymes of the CitE-like superfamily, which
have also been reported to be trimers [7,24], including the
malyl-CoA thioesterase ofR. sphaeroides[11].
Although the TIM-barrel is conserved in malate
synthases, MCLs (Figure 8A), and other CitE-like en-
zymes, both malate synthase A (MSA) and malate syn-
thase G (MSG) also possess an additional N-terminal
domain [23,28] of about 90 and 115 residues, respect-
ively, that folds around the TIM-barrel. Furthermore
MSG has a rather large (~ 200 residues) domain inser-
tion between TIM-barrel secondary structure elements.
In contrast, MCLC and MCLR both have a smaller in-
sertion of ~40 and ~30 residues after the sixthβ-strand
of the TIM-barrel, which appears to be specific to the
MCLs, judging from structure and sequence compari-
sons with malate synthases and CitE-like enzymes. These
additional domains are arranged around the three-fold
axes on top of the trimers and are in contact with one
another. However, there are also differences in the C-
terminal domains of the MCLs in comparison to MSA,
MSG, and HaloMS [23]. In MSA and MSG the domain
consists of 5α-helices and theβ-hairpin. The β-hairpin
is structurally conserved in all of the aforementioned
enzymes, whereas the number of α-helices differs
(Figure 8B). In contrast to the canonical malate
synthases, this lid domain in the MCLs closes off the
active site of the neighboring subunit in the trimers
and not of its own TIM-barrel. This is probably also
the case in the HaloMS, because a region of more than
40 residues is missing from its crystal structures (PDB
3PUG, 3OYX, 3OYZ) that would connect the TIM-
barrel with the C-termina l domain. Although this
domain was modeled as if it were covering the active
s i t eo ft h es a m es u b u n i t ,i ti sp o s s i b l et h a ti ta c t u a l l y
extends to the neighboring subunit as explained by
Bracken et al. [23].
Movement of the C-terminal lid domain
Rotations of the C-terminal lid domains of ~30° in
MCLC (Figure 4B) and ~18° in MCLR relative to their
TIM-barrel cores were observed. In both structures the
bending region is located in a short linker that connects
the last helix of the TIM-barrel with the first helix of the
lid domain. In both cases the linkers start with a phenyl-
alanine residue (Phe286 and Phe263, respectively). The
bending of the chains progresses through residues
Ser287 and Pro288 in MCLC and through Thr264 and
Pro265 in MCLR (in Additional file 1: Figure S1 and
Additional file 2: Figure S2). The phenylalanine and pro-
line in these linkers appear to be well conserved within
the CitE-like superfamily of enzymes. It is therefore
likely that a similar conformational change can occur in
these enzymes as well.
Interestingly, there is much less interaction of each
TIM-barrel with the neighboring C-terminal domains in
the open conformation assembly; the reduction in sur-
face area is ~500 Å
2 in both MCLC and MCLR. The re-
duced interaction of the lid domain with the TIM-barrel
in the open conformation probably leads to increased
flexibility and multiple conformations. This may be the
reason why the electron density for the lid domain be-
yond the bending region was weak or non-existent for
three of the subunits in the MCLR structure that was
soaked with propionyl-CoA. Furthermore, the average
temperature factors of residues in the lid domains are
about two times higher than those of the TIM-barrel
residues in both MCLs, underscoring their flexibility.
This is also consistent with the previously reported
structures of RipC ofY. pestis (PDB 3QLL) and another
CitE-like enzyme of M. tuberculosis (PDB 1U5H). Both
of these enzymes belong to the type 1 subgroup in the
phylogentic tree of the CitE-like superfamily (Figure 2).
In both these cases the lid domains could not be mod-
eled due to the lack of electron density [7,24].
The mobility of the C-terminal domain may have an
effect on substrate binding. As mentioned above, for
MCLR crystals grown in the absence of added sub-
strates, electron density (modeled as glyoxylate) was
only observed in the two subunits with completely
closed active sites. After an additional soaking step with
propionyl-CoA, electron density for the CoA thioester
was found in one of these two sites.
The only other observed conformational changes in
the MCLC and MCLR structures upon substrate binding
are associated with the movement of the C-terminal
domains. The changes occur in a loop consisting of resi-
dues 192–203 in MCLC and residues 174–187 in MCLR.
This loop belongs to the additional MCL-specific small
insertions mentioned earlier. The loop interacts, pre-
dominantly through hydrogen bonds and bridging
waters, with the C-terminal domains of the neighboring
subunits in the closed conformation. In enzymes that
cluster together with MCLC in the phylogenetic tree
(Figure 2) the corresponding loop region is extremely
well conserved. However, the same loop region in the
MCLR is only conserved in more closely related en-
zymes and not throughout the whole cluster of MCLR-
like lyases. However, this cluster comprises enzymes that
share less than 40% amino acid sequence identity with
MCLR. In contrast, enzymes that cluster together with
Zarzycki and KerfeldBMC Structural Biology2013, 13:28 Page 12 of 19
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/13/28
the MCL ofC. aurantiacus are much more closely related
to one another, with amino acid identities of at least 57% in
pairwise alignments.
Mobility of the C-terminal lid domain was also pro-
posed for malate synthases (MSA and MSG) [27], but
not observed in crystal structures. The C-terminal
domain is much larger in MSA and MSG than in CitE-
like enzymes, which include the haloarchaeal malate
synthase (HaloMS). However, small angle X-ray scat-
tering and circular dichroism experiments with malate
synthases from baker ’s yeast and maize [31-33]
suggested a conformational change within the enzymes
upon substrate binding.
Active sites and substrate binding
The C-terminal lid domains seem to play crucial roles in
the interaction with the substrates. Most of the active
site residues contributed by the lid domains appear to be
involved in the binding of the pantetheine moiety of the
CoA thioester substrate. Moreover, an aspartate residue
(Asp318 in MCLC and Asp299 in MCLR) located in the
C-terminal domain structurally aligns with a putative
catalytic aspartate in the structures of HaloMS, MSA
and MSG (Figure 8C). Despite the low amino acid se-
quence identity between both MCLC and MCLR, most
of the residues involved in the formation of the active
site and substrate binding are conserved, including all of
the putative catalytic residues (Figures 5 and 8C). The
residues Arg92 and Asp318 in MCLC correspond to
Arg76 and Asp299 in MCLR; they are conserved in the
entire CitE-like superfamily as well as in the malate
synthases. The only exception was found in the enzymes
that cluster together with the malyl-CoA thioesterase of
R. sphaeroidesin the phylogenetic tree (Figure 2). A con-
served glutamate residue is present instead of aspartate
in these enzymes. The glutamate and aspartate residues
that coordinate the Mg
2+ ion (Glu157 & Asp184 in
MCLC, Glu141 & Asp168 in MCLR) are also absolutely
conserved among CitE-like superfamily enzymes and the
malate synthases. The same is true for the residues
Glu60 and Asp61 in MCLC (corresponding to Glu44
and Asp45 in MCLR), which form hydrogen bonds with
the two water molecules that also coordinate the Mg
2+
ion. The remaining two sites of the octahedral Mg2+ co-
ordination sphere are occupied by oxygen atoms of the
respective bound carbonic acid, which is oxalate or
glyoxylate in the structures of the MCLs. This Mg
2+ co-
ordination is consistent with available structures of
malate synthases (compare Figure 8C).
Only a minor difference can be observed between the
active sites of MCLC and MCLR. The conserved argin-
ine residue in MCLC (Arg92) forms a hydrogen bond
with a neighboring asparagine (Asn58). This asparagine
residue is 100% conserved among the lyases that cluster
together with MCLC in the phylogenetic tree (Figure 2).
In MCLR this residue is replaced by an aspartate
(Asp42), which also forms hydrogen bonds with the cor-
responding Arg76 (Figure 5). The aspartate residue, how-
ever, is absolutely conserved for the CitE-like superfamily
enzymes, as well as among malate synthases. The posi-
tioning of the arginine residue, however, does not seem to
be affected by the Asp/Asn substitution in the MCLC.
However, it appears that the hydrogen bonding is gener-
ally important for the correct orientation of the arginine
and therefore the binding of the substrates. This is also
evident from mutational studies on the MSG fromE. coil,
where the positionally conserved arginine residue was re-
placed by lysine; this resulted in a substantially reduced
catalytic activity (6.6% of wild type level) as well as in a
10-fold increase of theK
m value for acetyl-CoA [25].
Comparison of reaction mechanisms and substrate
specificities of MCLR, MCLC and malate synthases
A reaction mechanism for malate synthase (Figure 9)
was proposed by Howard et al. [27] for theE. coli MSG
(MSGE). Asp631 acts as a base and abstracts a proton
from the α-carbon of acetyl-CoA [34,35]. The import-
ance of this aspartate residue was demonstrated by mu-
tation to asparagine, which led to the complete loss of
enzymatic activity [25]. The negative charge of the eno-
late that is created upon proton abstraction from acetyl-
CoA is stabilized by Arg338, which also interacts with
the carbonyl oxygen of glyoxylate. After rotation of the
enolate intermediate, a nucleophilic attack on the car-
bonyl carbon of glyoxylate leads to the formation of a
new carbon-carbon bond and an oxyanion (Figure 9).
The oxyanion is stabilized by the positive charges of
Mg
2+ and Arg338. Unfortunately, it is not quite clear
how the CoA thioester hydrolysis proceeds. It was pro-
posed that one of the two water molecules coordinating
the Mg
2+ ion may be responsible [30]. However, the re-
moval of this water from the octahedral coordination
sphere of the magnesium ion is energetically unfavorable
[36]. Furthermore, these two water molecules are also
present in the structures of the malyl-CoA lyases, which
do not exhibit any detectable thioester hydrolysis activ-
ity. Therefore, another water molecule may be respon-
sible for the CoA thioester hydrolysis step. Although the
active sites of malate synthases and MCLs appear to be
highly conserved, their respective reaction and substrate
specificities differ (see Figure 1 for comparison). Both
types of enzymes catalyze aldol reactions, which is com-
pletely reversible in the MCLs, but not in the malate
synthases due to the additional CoA thioester hydrolysis
step. However, the aldol reaction and the thioester hy-
drolysis have to occur independently of one another if a
product like malyl-CoA is to be released from the active
site. It is safe to assume that the aldol reaction in the
Zarzycki and KerfeldBMC Structural Biology2013, 13:28 Page 13 of 19
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/13/28
MCLs also proceeds via the formation of an enolate
intermediate (Figure 9), as was proposed for malate
synthases. However, in order for this reaction to be re-
versible, as it is in the MCLs (Figure 1), a proton has to
be abstracted from the hydroxyl group of the respective
CoA thioester substrates like malyl-CoA,β-methylmalyl-
CoA, or ( 3S)-citramalyl-CoA. Because this hydroxyl
group is coordinating the Mg2+ ion its pKa value would
be considerably lowered. The hydrogen of the hydroxyl
group would point away from the magnesium ion to-
wards the conserved arginine residue (Arg92 in MCLC,
Arg76 in MCLR), which seems to form a hydrogen bond
with this hydroxyl group. This makes the arginine resi-
due a likely candidate for the proton abstraction from
the hydroxyl group of malyl-CoA and similar substrates,
despite its usually high pKa value. Although it is fairly
rare that an arginine residue acts as a base in proton ab-
straction reactions, examples are known [37]. After the
carbon-carbon bond cleavage, the enolate intermediate
has to be neutralized by proton donation from the con-
served aspartate residue (Asp318 in MCLC, Asp299 in
MCLR). Therefore, both the Arg and Asp residues must
be available in deprotonated and protonated forms to
allow the aldol reaction to proceed in either direction.
Unfortunately, it is not clear from the MCL crystal
structures and comparisons to malate synthases (includ-
ing HaloMS) why MCLs do not also act as thioesterases.
As mentioned above, the CoA thioester hydrolysis may
depend on another solvent water molecule, which
could be present at the malyl-CoA intermediate step
(see Figure 9, intermediate 4) during catalysis in malate
synthases, but not in malyl-CoA lyases. Unfortunately,
there are no structures available that have captured the
malyl-CoA intermediate or a bound analog; there are
only structures containi ng either acetyl-CoA or free
CoA.
Nevertheless, within the two MCL clusters in the
phylogenetic tree (Figure 2) an alanine residue (Ala183
in MCLC and Ala167 in MCLR) is 100% conserved (in
Additional file 1: Figure S1 and Additional file 2: Figure
S2), whereas it is replaced by Leu454 in MSGE
(Figure 8C) and Trp277 in MSA ofE. coli. These larger
side chains likely prevent the efficient binding of
propionyl-CoA or β-methylmalyl-CoA by the malate
synthases. In the overlay of the active sites (Figure 8C)
the distances between Leu454 of MSGE and the terminal
carbons of the propionyl-CoA molecules in MCLC and
MCLR are 2.1 Å and 2.3 Å, respectively. Interestingly,
these residues correspond to a Val191 in the HaloMS,
which is conserved among haloarchaeal malate synthases
Figure 9Previously proposed reaction mechanism for malate synthase (adapted from Howardet al., 2000).Residue numbers correspond
to malate synthase G ofE. coli. Asp631 abstracts a proton from theα-carbon of acetyl-CoA(1). The enolate intermediate(2) performs a nucleo-
philic attack on the carbonyl carbon of glyoxylate(3). The oxyanion in the newly formed malyl-CoA intermediate(4) is stabilized by the positive
charges of Mg2+ and Arg338 [27]. The exact course of the following CoA thioester hydrolysis is not known. One of the water molecules coordinat-
ing the magnesium ion may be responsible for the protonation of the oxyanion resulting in the formation of a hydroxyl-anion(5), which subse-
quently attacks the CoA thioester bond [30] and facilitates the formation of malate and free CoA(6). The dashed arrows represent reversed
reactions that have to be catalyzed by malyl-CoA lyases if this proposed reaction mechanism is correct.
Zarzycki and KerfeldBMC Structural Biology2013, 13:28 Page 14 of 19

and haloarchaeal MCLs. Valine is just small enough to
allow propionyl-CoA binding, which may explain why
HaloMS is still able to catalyze the formation of β-
methylmalyl-CoA [15]. Why the CoA thioester bond in
β-methylmalyl-CoA is not hydrolyzed by HaloMS cannot
be explained at this point.
Furthermore, MCLC is known to efficiently catalyze
the cleavage of (S)-citramalyl-CoA into acetyl-CoA and
pyruvate, whereas the reverse reaction of citramalyl-CoA
synthesis was only reported in high excess concentra-
tions of pyruvate [10]. Malate synthases are obviously
able to bind pyruvate together with acetyl-CoA, as ob-
served in the crystal structures of MSGE (PDB 1P7T)
and HaloMS (PDB 3OYZ). However, in the HaloMS
structure the methyl group of pyruvate forms close con-
tacts with Pro231 and Trp257 [23]. An expansion of the
active site was observed in the HaloMS structure with
bound pyruvate and acetyl-CoA [23], compared to the
structure that only had glyoxylate bound (PDB 3OYX).
This may be the reason why addition of pyruvate to
acetyl-CoA is unfavorable in HaloMS as well as in the
MCLs, where both the proline and the tryptophan resi-
dues are conserved (Figure 5 & 8C). On the other hand,
the geometry at the carbonyl-carbon of pyruvate is pla-
nar, whereas the geometry at the corresponding carbon
in citramalyl-CoA is tetrahedral. Therefore, the methyl
group of citramalyl-CoA would assume a different pos-
ition further away from the proline and tryptophan resi-
dues, which may favor binding of citramalyl-CoA over
binding of pyruvate and acetyl-CoA. Interestingly, a
close contact (2.4 Å) between the α-carbon of acetyl-
CoA and the keto-carbon of pyruvate was reported for
HaloMS [23]. Pyruvate and acetyl-CoA are actually
substrates for the homologous malate synthase of H.
marismortui (81% identity to the H. volcanii enzyme);
the enzyme is able to catalyze the formation of (S)-citra-
malyl-CoA, but not the hydrolysis of its CoA thioester
bond [15]. Although theK
m-value for pyruvate was high
(30 mM) for the H. marismotui malate synthase, the
pyruvate concentration during soaking of theH. volcanii
crystals was even higher, 70 mM [23]. We used the
deposited structure factors for the HaloMS structure
with bound pyruvate and acetyl-CoA (PDB 3OYZ) to re-
examine the electron density. Interestingly, in the
original maps there was still some additional positive
density (F
O-FC) between pyruvate and acetyl-CoA [23],
indicating that there may be a connection of the carbon
backbones of both substrates. Hence, we tried modeling
in ( S)-citramalyl-CoA. Superposition of the refined
(S)-citramalyl-CoA (Additional file 3: Figure S3) shows that
it fits slightly better into a simulated annealing omit map.
This suggests that the carbon-carbon bond formation can
still be catalyzed in these crystals and that there was prob-
ably a mixture of different reaction states present.
It should also be noted that both HaloMS as well as
HaloMCL can act as malyl-CoA thioesterases, meaning
that they are able to use malyl-CoA as substrate, in
contrast to the canonical malate synthases [35,38].
Moreover, both haloarchaeal enzymes also release malyl-
CoA as the product of acetyl-CoA and glyoxylate con-
densation during catalysis [15]. This is not the case
with conventional malate synthases; they do not release
malyl-CoA as an intermediate. Both the HaloMS and
HaloMCL represent interesting chimeric enzymes com-
bining MCL and malate synthase functions. Both are
able to catalyze the same reactions as other MCLs, namely
the formation and cleavage of malyl-CoA,β-methylmalyl-
CoA, and ( S)-citramalyl-CoA. However, they can also
catalyze the hydrolysis of the malyl-CoA thioester bond like
the other malate synthases, but they do not hydrolyze the
CoA thioester bonds ofβ-methylmalyl-CoA or (S)-citrama-
lyl-CoA. Although, HaloMS and HaloMCL have very
similar substrate spectra andreaction specificities, theK
m
values for the respective subs trates differ significantly,
defining their distinct functions in the methylaspartate
cycle [15] as malate synthase orβ-methylmalyl-CoA lyase,
respectively.
Similarly, genome analysis revealed that there are two
different types of MCLs present in M. extorquens that
are regulated differentially, depending on the mode of
growth [39]. One of the MCLs is phylogenetically related
to the enzyme of R. sphaeroides, the other to the C.
auranticus enzyme (Figure 2). It was found that M.
extorquens also uses the ethylmalonly-CoA pathway to
assimilate the acetyl-CoA that derives from its serine
cycle [40,41] and it is also able to grow on acetate as the
sole carbon source instead of C
1 substrates by using the
ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway. It is tempting to speculate
that one of the MCLs in M. extorquens is specifically
used for the cleavage of malyl-CoA in the serine cycle,
whereas the primary functions of the second MCL
are the cleavage ofβ-methylmalyl-CoA and the synthe-
sis of malyl-CoA in the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway.
Both these enzymes may be optimized to work in one
or the other direction under physiological substrate
concentrations.
Two other distinct groups of the CitE-like superfam-
ily of enzymes (type I and type II in Figure 2) may be
carbon-carbon bond lyases as well. It was suggested
that the CitE-like enzymes of Mycobacterium tubercu-
losis and Yersinia pestis , which belongs to the type I
enzymes in Figure 2, also use free CoA thioesters as
substrates [7,24]. Several more crystal structures of
CitE-like superfamily enzymes are available although
their physiological functions are unknown. Some of
these structures were claimed to be the CitE subunit of
citrate lyase, but that may not be correct, judging by
amino acid sequence and phylogenetic analysis.

Conclusions
Despite the relatively low amino acid sequence identity
between MCLC and MCLR, their tertiary and quater-
nary structures are almost identical. The only prominent
differences were found in the N-termini, which differ
in size and orientation. These N-termini influence the
strength of the interaction at the dimer interface be-
tween trimers in the hexameric assemblies. Furthermore,
the comparison of the two MCL structures to the
structures of HaloMS, MSG, and MSA does not explain
why the MCLs are not able to hydrolyze CoA thioester
bonds. Very few differences were observed between the
active sites. Nevertheless, some hints emerge to explain
the different substrate specificities of the MCLs com-
pared to the different kinds of malate synthases. The
structures and the previously proposed reaction mech-
anism for malate synthases suggest that malyl-CoA ly-
ases should be able to hydrolyze CoA thioester bonds
too. This however, has not been observed.
Collectively, these structures and the comparative ana-
lyses of the catalytic mechanism proposed for malate
synthases lay the foundation for further studies including
site directed mutagenesis to gain insights into the spe-
cific determinants of the different reaction specificities.
Expanding the biochemical and structural knowledge
about other CitE-like enzymes may also help to under-
stand why MCLs are not hydrolyzing CoA-thioester
bonds, especially since the structures of several CitE-like
enzymes have been solved already but without know-
ledge of their respective functions, substrate spectra, and
catalyzed reactions.
Methods
Cloning and protein expression
The gene coding for MCLC from C. aurantiacus OK-
70-fl was amplified using chromosomal DNA as
template. Two oligonucleotid es (introduced restriction
sites are italic) were designed upstream (5 ′-g g g a -
gaagca tatgcgcaag ctagctc -3′; NdeI) and downstream
(5′- gcgctcatcc ctctaagctt gctgcac -3′; HindIII) of the
gene coding for MCLC. PCR was performed with Pfu
polymerase for 32 cycles, including denaturation
for 60 s at 94°C, annealing for 60 s at 58°C, and
polymerization for 140 s at 72°C. The PCR product
was cloned into the pT7-7 vector [42] for expression in
Escherichia coli resulting in plasmid pT7-MCL_Ca.
The cloning of the MCLR fromR. sphaeroides2.4.1 was
described by Erbet al. [11]. The plasmid pMCL1_RS_JZ_03
for overexpression inE. coli was kindly provided by Prof.
Birgit Alber.
Competent E. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed
with the respective plasmids and 1 liter cultures were
grown at 27°C in of LB medium with 100μg ampicillin
ml
-1. Due to the leaky expression of the plasmids, the
cultures were not induced with IPTG. The cells were
harvested after 24 h of growth and stored at −80°C
until use.
The cloning and expression of the helper enzyme
mesaconyl-C1-CoA hydratase was described previously [43].
Purification of recombinant enzymes
All purification steps were performed at 4°C. Protein con-
centrations were determined using the Bradford method
[44]. E. coli cells containing the recombinant MCLC were
resuspended in a two-fold volume of 50 mM Tris(hydroxy-
methyl)aminomethane (Tris)/HCl buffer (pH 7.5) contain-
ing 2 mM of MgCl
2. Cells were lysed by sonication (model
W-220 F, Branson) and the lysate was heat precipitated
for 15 min at 65°C followed by 40 min centrifugation
(40,000 ×g)a t4 ° C .A7 . 5m lD E A Ef a s tf l o wS e p h a r o s e
(Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) column was equili-
brated with 20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5 containing 2 mM
MgCl
2 (buffer A). The supernatant of the heat precipitation
was applied to the column at a flow rate of 1 ml min-1.T h e
column was extensively washed with buffer A. The concen-
tration of NaCl in buffer A was increased in 50 mM steps

centrated using centrifugal ultra-filtration devices with a
molecular weight cut-off of 30 kDa (Amicon Ultra-15,
Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). A 24 ml gel filtration col-
umn (Superdex 200 10/30 GL, GE Healthcare, Waukesha,
WI, USA) was equilibrated with 20 mM Tris/HCl pH 7.5
buffer containing 2 mM MgCl
2 and 100 mM NaCl (buffer
B). Concentrated MCLC was then applied to the column at
af l o wr a t eo f0 . 4m lm i n-1.
E. coli cells containing N-terminal His10-tagged MCLR
were suspended in a two-fold volume of 50 mM Tris/
HCl pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl and 5 mM MgCl2 (buffer C).
Cells were lysed by sonication and the lysate was
centrifuged for 40 min (40,000 ×g)a t4 ° C .A1m lN i -
Sepharose column (HisTrap HP; GE Healthcare,
Waukesha, WI, USA) was equilibrated with buffer C.
The cell extracts (40,000 × g supernatants) were ap-
plied to the column at a flow rate of 1 ml min
-1.T h e
column was washed with buffer C containing 100 mM
imidazole to remove unspecifically bound proteins.
Recombinant His-tagged MCLR was eluted at 500 mM
imidazole in buffer C. The enzyme was concentrated as
described above and then applied to a 24 ml gel filtra-
tion column equilibrated with buffer B at a flow rate of
0.4 ml min
-1.
The purification of the helper enzyme mesaconyl-C1-
CoA hydratase was described previously [43].
Purified enzymes were concentrated and stored at 4°C
for 2 weeks at most or at−80°C for several months be-
fore use. Protein standards used during gel filtration
were thyroglobulin (670 kDa), γ-globulin (158 kDa),

ovalbumin (44 kDa), myoglobin (17 kDa), and vitamin
B12 (1.35 kDa).
Enzyme activity assays
One unit (U) corresponds to an enzyme activity of
1 μmol min-1 mg(protein)
-1 . The activity of purified MCLC
and MCLR was routinely confirmed in a previously de-
scribed [10] coupled spectrophotometric assay that was
slightly modified. In this assay the formation of β-
methylmalyl-CoA from propionyl-CoA and glyoxylate is
monitored. β-Methylmalyl-CoA is dehydrated by the
coupling enzyme mesaconyl-C1-CoA hydratase, which
can be followed at 290 nm. An estimated absorption co-
efficient of 3,400 M
-1 cm-1 at 290 nm for the product
mesaconyl-C1-CoA was used. This estimation is based
on the assumption that the molar absorption coefficients
at 260 nm (ε
260 nm )o f α,β-unsaturated CoA esters is
22,600 M -1 cm-1 [45]. The assay mixture (0.4 ml)
contained 200 mM MOPS/KOH buffer (pH 7.5), 5 mM
MgCl2, 0.3 mM propionyl-CoA, 3 mM glyoxylate, 10 U of
mesaconyl-C1-CoA hydratase, and recombinant MCLC or
MCLR. The reaction was carried out at 30°C and was
started by addition of either glyoxylate or MCL.
The condensation of pyruvate and acetyl-CoA to (S)-
citramalyl-CoA by MCLR was observed in an HPLC
based assay. The reaction mixture (0.5 ml) contained
200 mM MOPS/KOH (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl
2, 0.5 mM
acetyl-CoA, excess (100 mM) of pyruvate, and 0.25 U
(referring to the formation ofβ-methylmalyl-CoA) of re-
combinant MCLR. After 0, 5 and 10 min of incubation a
sample of 100 μl was withdrawn and the reaction was
stopped on ice by addition of 10μl of 90% formic acid.
Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation, and
the supernatants analyzed for CoA thioesters by reversed
phase HPLC.
Analytical high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)
HPLC was performed using a Waters Alliance e2695
system (Waters, Milford, MA). Reaction products and
standard compounds were detected by UV absorbance
with a Waters 998 photodiode array detector at 260 nm.
CoA thioesters were identified by retention times and
their respective UV spectra (220– 340 nm) as described
elsewhere [10]. A reversed phase C
18 column (Waters
SymmetryShield, 4 μm, 250 × 4 mm) was used. A flow
rate of 0.6 ml min-1 and a gradient of 28 min from 4 to
28% acetonitrile in 40 mM K 2HPO4/HCOOH buffer
(pH 4.2) were applied.
Crystallization and structure determination
Crystals were grown at 22°C using either the sitting- or
hanging-drop vapor diffusion methods. Two different
approaches were used to grow crystals of MCLC: (i)
Purified enzyme (3.5 mg ml
-1) was mixed with 60 mM
bis-Tris propane/citric acid pH 6.6, 20% (w/v) polyethy-
leneglycol (PEG) 3350, 20 mM MgCl2 in a ratio of 1:1
(enzyme:crystallization buffer). Crystals were briefly
soaked with crystallization buffer supplemented with
25% (v/v) glycerol before the crystals were plunged into
liquid nitrogen for freezing. (ii) Purified enzyme
(7.5 mg ml
-1) was mixed with 0.1 M Na-cacodylate
pH 5.5, 20% (w/v) PEG 4 K and with buffer B contain-
ing 20 mM propionyl-CoA and 25 mM sodium-oxalate
(buffer B-PO) in a ratio of 1:2:1 (enzyme:crystallization
buffer:buffer B-PO). Crystal drops were supplemented
with 20% (v/v) PEG 400 shortly before the crystals
were cryo-cooled in liquid nitrogen.
Likewise, two different conditions were used to grow
crystals of MCLR: (i) Purified enzyme (3 mg ml
-1)w a s
mixed with 0.1 M Tris/HCl pH 8.5, 20% (w/v) PEG 3350,
20 mM MgCl2 in a ratio of 2:3 (enzyme:crystallization buf-
fer). Crystals were soaked for varying time periods in
crystallization drop mixture supplemented with 8 mM
propionyl-CoA and 25% (v/v) glycerol before the crystals
were plunged into liquid nitrogen for freezing.(ii) Purified
enzyme (2.5 mg ml
-1) was mixed with 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-
1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid (HEPES)/NaOH pH 7.5,
0.1 M MgCl2, 10% (w/v) PEG 4000 and with buffer B-PO in
a ratio of 1:2:1 (enzyme:crystallization buffer:buffer B-PO).
Crystal drops were supplemented with 20% (v/v) PEG 400
shortly before the crystals were cryo-cooled in liquid
nitrogen.
X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Lawrence
Berkeley Laboratory Advanced Light Source (beamlines
5.0.1, 5.0.2, 5.0.3). The data was processed with XDS
[46] and the CCP4 software package [47]. All structures
were solved by molecular replacement using AutoMR-,
Phaser-MR-, and AutoBuild-programs of the Phenix
software package [48]. The MCLR structure was solved
first using the structure of a CitE-like enzyme from
Mycobacterium tuberculosis (PDB 1U5H) [7] as the
search model. The structure of MCLR was refined with
Phenix.refine and subsequently used as a search model
to solve the structure of MCLC. Additional manual
modeling and ligand fitting was done with COOT [49].
Further refinements, as well as water-picking for all
structures were performed by Phenix.refine. The atomic
coordinates and structure factors (PDB IDs: 4L7Z, 4L80,
4L9Y, 4L9Z) have been deposited in the Protein Data
Bank [http://wwpdb.org/].
Phylogenetic tree construction
Amino acid sequence searches within the domains of
Bacteria and Archaea were performed using BLAST
[http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/]. Accession numbers for
reference sequences are provided in Table 1. A cut-off E
value of 1e
-60 was applied for all BLAST searches except
for those using theβ-subunit of citrate lyase ofKlebsiella
Zarzycki and KerfeldBMC Structural Biology2013, 13:28 Page 17 of 19
http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6807/13/28
pneumonia as query in which the cut-off was 1e-80. All
sequences that appeared to be truncated were removed
from the data set. All sequences that were more than
90% identical to another one were removed with
CD-HIT [50] to further reduce the amount of data. The
sequences of the E. coli malate synthases A and G
(Accession AAC76984 and AAC76012, respectively)
were added and alignment was performed with the BioE-
dit program [http://www.mbio.ncsu.edu/bioedit/bioedit.
html] using the similarity matrix PAM250. The phylo-
genetic tree was constructed from a total of 675 amino
acid sequences using MEGA5 [51] and the Neighbor-
Joining method [52]. A bootstrap consensus tree [53]
was inferred from 1000 replicates. The distances were
calculated using the Poisson method. Positions in the
alignment with less than 95% coverage were eliminated.
Other methods
Chimera [54] was used to analyze and align crystal struc-
tures and to make figures. Protein interfaces were analyzed
using the PISA webserver [55] [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-
srv/prot_int/pistart.html]. Protein-protein interactions were
also analyzed by use the PIC-webserver tool [56]
[http://pic.mbu.iisc.ernet.in]. Hidden Markov models
(HMM) and HMM logos were created using HMMER
Version 3.0 [57] and LogoMat-M [58], respectively.
