Abstract 
Sphaerobacter thermophilus synthesizes an ω‑transaminase (ω‑TA) that allows the production of enantiomerically 
pure β‑amino acids. To obtain ω‑TA variants with a higher activity and more favorable properties for industrial use, we 
modified critical amino acid residues either in the catalytic center or in a previously proposed signature motif criti‑
cal for aromatic β‑amino acid ω‑TAs. Seventeen different variants of this enzyme were generated and their activity 
was examined with four β‑amino acids and one γ‑amino acid, and compared with the wildtype’s activity. Among 
all variants, seven showed up to ninefold higher activity with at least one of the tested substrates. For most of these 
seven variants, the temperature optimum was even lower as in the wild type enzyme, with keeping a high tempera‑
ture stability, making them more valuable for industrial purposes. Our results indicate that for the production of enan‑
tiomerically pure β‑amino acids replacement of critical amino acid residues in the proposed signature motif of ω‑TAs 
is a more effective strategy than modifying their catalytic center. Another finding was, that the proposed motif 
is not only suitable for aromatic amino acid ω‑TAs, because some of the variants have a higher activity with β‑alanine 
or β‑leucine than with aromatic β‑amino acids.
Key Points 
• An ω‑transaminase was modified to enhance its velocity in kinetic resolution.
• 17 variants were created and their properties were compared with the wildtype.
• 7 of them have a higher reaction speed with different β‑amino acids as the wildtype.

Graphical Abstract
Introduction
In all organisms, amino acids play a central role as build -
ing blocks of proteins and occur as intermediates in 
nitrogen (N) metabolism. Next to the proteinogenic 
α-amino acids, there also exist β- and γ-amino acids in 
which the amino group is shifted from the α-carbon to 
the adjacent β- or γ-carbon. They are not used in riboso -
mal protein synthesis, but take over specialized functions 
as secondary metabolites. For instance, certain rice cul -
tivars secrete β-tyrosine in their root exudates to inhibit 
the growth of competing dicots or microbes (Yan et  al. 
2015). Other β- and γ-amino acids are components of 
secondary metabolites, such as β-alanine that is the most 
abundant β-amino acid and part of Coenzyme A (Juaristi 
and Soloshonok 2005). Others are part of complex sec -
ondary metabolites, like paclitaxel and lidamycin, which 
are used as therapeutics against several kinds of cancer 
(Wani et  al. 1971; Hu et  al. 1988) or to treat neurologi -
cal dysfunctions (Crawford et  al. 1987; Goa and Sorkin 
1993; Field et  al. 2001; Jääskeläinen 2005; Hamandi and 
Sander 2006). Another function of β- and γ-amino acids 
is found in the synthesis of peptidomimetics (Cabrele 
et al. 2014; Fujino et al. 2016), which are peptides consist-
ing of β- and γ-amino acids whose secondary structures 
are similar to those of peptides made of their α-amino 
acid analogues (Iverson 1997; Koert 1997; Seebach et al. 
1996; Seebach and Matthews 1997; Szefczyk 2021). The 
fact that these peptidomimetics are often less degradable 
by proteolytic enzymes (Hintermann and Seebach 1997; 
Frackenpohl et  al. 2001; Gopi et  al. 2003; Hook et  al. 
2004), increases their half-life as therapeutics.
The chemical synthesis of β- and γ-amino acids is 
mainly hampered by the poor stereo selectivity, which 
requires a cost-intensive separation of enantiomers 
(Weiner et  al. 2010). On the other hand, a direct enan -
tiopure synthesis of β- and γ-amino acids depends on 
expensive, and sometimes toxic, catalyzing agents and 
chiral-specific auxiliary materials (Liu and Sibi 2002). A 
promising alternative to chemical pathways is the enzy -
matic synthesis by transaminases (TAs).
In general, two reaction modes are suitable for the use 
of TAs: the kinetic resolution and the asymmetric syn -
thesis (Shon et  al. 2014). During the kinetic resolution, 
a racemic mixture is purified by stereo-selective deg -
radation of one of the enantiomers. While making an 
expensive purification or the use of chiral-specific agents 
dispensable the drawback is a yield reduction by 50%. The 
asymmetric synthesis starts from a prochiral compound, 
e.g. a β-keto acid. This approach can lead to higher yields, 
but substrates as β-keto acids are not stable. In aqueous 
solutions, they tend to lose their carboxylic group (Bach 
and Canepa 1996; Xue et al. 2018). A valid alternative is

Wegner et al. AMB Express          (2023) 13:117 
 
the use of β-keto esters. By hydrolyzing the ester imme -
diately before the transamination, it has been possible 
to produce β-phenylalanine from ethyl benzoylacetate 
(Buß et  al. 2018). Another problem for the asymmetric 
syntheses is the unfavorable reaction equilibrium, laying 
on the side of the reactants (Fuchs et al. 2015). In princi -
ple, both enantiomers can be produced by using an ω-TA 
with high enantioselectivity. One enantiomer is produced 
by the kinetic resolution and the other by using the same 
enzyme for the asymmetric synthesis. Figure  1 presents 
the two reaction modes exemplary for the production of 
a β-amino acid, which work in the same way for γ-amino 
acids, aldehydes or ketones.
Recently, a thermostable ω-TA from Sphaerobacter 
thermophilus has been described, which is able to use 
a broad range of substrates (Mathew et al. 2016) (RCSB 
(Berman et  al. 2000) accession: 6K8H; NCBI accession: 
WP_012871332.1), hereinafter called StoTA (Sphaerobac-
ter thermophilus ω-transaminase). A preliminary enzyme 
activity assay confirmed that this enzyme is able to turn 
over a wide range of different substrates (Fig.  2). Among 
these were several aromatic, a branched-chain and an 
aliphatic β-amino acid as well as an aliphatic γ-amino 
acid. Though StoTA was able to transform all substrates, 
the reaction velocity was rather low (Table  1). We subse-
quently tried to improve the enzyme’s turnover rate by a 
number of genetic modifications to increase its applica -
tion for industrial use. For this purpose, we employed two 
approaches to generate StoTA variants with improved 
enzymatic properties, either by substituting critical 
residues in its catalytic center or by modifying critical 
residues in a motif that has been proposed to be critical 
for aromatic ω-TAs. In total, we generated 17 variants 
of StoTA and determined their specific activity with five 
substrates, as well as their pH, temperature optima and 
temperature stability. The aim of this study was to obtain 
StoTA variants with a higher activity and more favorable 
properties for industrial use.
Material and methods
To illustrate the protein structure of the StoTA wild type 
and its variants for the motif adaption, ChimeraX was 
employed (Goddard et al. 2018). The crystal structure of 
StoTA is available at the protein data bank (Berman et al. 
2000), accession 6K8H (Kwon et  al. 2019). Conforma -
tional changes in the active center as depicted in Addi -
tional file 1: Figure S1 were illustrated by employing Mol* 
(Sehnal et al. 2021), using the same structure, 6K8H.
The coding sequence of StoTA was purchased as gene 
fragments from Eurofins (Eurofins, Luxemburg), together 
with all primers used in this work. Prior to ordering, 
the sequence was adapted to E. coli’s codon usage, by 
an in-house script provided by Eurofins (https:// eurof 
insge nomics. com/ en/ order pages/ genes ynthe sis/ order 
genes/). A blast search (Altschul et al. 1997, 2005) of the 
putative motif (Crismaru et  al. 2013) against the StoTA 
sequence (Fig. 3) was performed to select the residues to 
be substituted.
Primers were designed with an 18-base overlap (see 
Additional file  1: Table  S1), to allow an isothermal

assembly (Stemmer et  al. 1995; Gibson 2011) after 
PCR. Each primer contained a single triplet, which dif -
fered from the template. PCR reactions were carried in 
a thermo cycler (Eppendorf Epgradient S Mastercycler), 
with an initial denaturation step at 98 °C for 3 min, fol -
lowed by 35 cycles, each starts with a 10 s step at 98 °C. 
This was followed by a 30 s annealing step. The annealing 
temperatures can be found in Additional file  1: Table S2. 
At the end of each cycle, an elongation step at 72 °C for 
1.5 min was performed. After the last cycle a final elon -
gation at 72 °C for 10 min was done. After this step the 
temperature was hold at 4 °C.
PCR amplicons were cleaned by agarose gel electro -
phoresis and used for isothermal assembly. For assem -
bly NEBuilder ® HiFi DNA Assembly Cloning Kit (New 
England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA USA) was used, follow -
ing the manufacturers protocol. The assembled genes 
were brought into pET 21 b (+) vector (Novagen, Merck, 
Darmstadt, Germany), using XhoI and Nde I (Thermo 
Scientific, Bremen, Germany). PET 21 b (+) provides a 
His-tag, directly behind the XhoI cleavage site, which was 
needed for subsequent purification of the ω-TAs.
The following substitutions were created: Sin -
gle mutants: S17P , T38V, Y47T, and N70E; dou -
ble mutants: S17P|T38V, S17P|Y47T, S17P|N70E, 
T38V|Y47T, T38V|N70E, Y47T|N70E; triple mutants: 
S17P|T38V|Y47T, 17P|Y47T|N70E, S17P|T38V|N70E, 
T38V|Y47T|N70E; and the quadruple mutant 
S17P|T38V|Y47T|N70E.
After plasmid assembly, the individual StoTA con -
structs were amplified in E. coli XL1 blue (Stratagene 
CA, USA). Transformation and selection were performed 
according to manufacturer’s protocol. The plasmids were 
isolated and transferred into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells 
(Stratagene CA, USA). Positive transformants were iden -
tified in the same way as in XL1 blue. 50 ml of LB-Amp 
medium were inoculated to obtain an  OD600 nm of 0.075. 
The cultures were shaken (37  °C, 180  rpm) for 2  h. For 
each construct, two samples were made, one which was 
induced with 0.5 mM IPTG, another as negative control 
without IPTG. Thereafter, cultures were shaken at 37 °C 
and 180  rpm for another 2  h. After this step, cells were 
harvested and lysed in bugbuster ® (Merck, Darmstadt, 
Germany) following the manufacturer’s protocol and 
centrifuged for 5 min at 4 °C and 16,000g. The superna -
tant containing the soluble protein fraction was sepa -
rated from the pellet. The latter, containing insoluble 
protein fraction and cell debris was resuspended in 250 µl 
of TE-buffer pH 7.4. 20 µl of all fractions were used for 
one-dimensional SDS-PAGE (Laemmli 1970). After 
electrophoresis, Western blots were performed using 
a PVDF membrane (Towbin et  al. 1979). To figure out 
which samples contained the modified variants of StoTA, 
membranes were stained by antibodies selective for the 
His-tags. The rest of the supernatant was used for the 
extraction of the StoTA variants via Ni–NTA (Abcam, 
Cambridge, UK), again following the manufacturer’s 
protocol. The protein concentration of the extracts was 
determined with Roti Nanoquant® (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, 
Germany) following the manufacturers protocol for 
micro titer plates.
Activity assay
Activity assays were performed to compare the activity of 
the wild type StoTA enzyme with the mutated variants. 
To measure enzyme activities 10  µl of purified enzyme 
solution was added to 90 µl of reaction medium contain -
ing 10  mM amino donor (all from TCI, Tokyo, Japan), 
4  mM pyruvate (Boehringer-Mannheim, Mannheim, 
Germany), 0.1  mM PLP (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) 
and 0.1  M potassium-phosphate buffer pH 8.0. After 
incubation for 30 min at 40 °C, 17.5 µl of the sample was 
diluted with 52.5 µl water and 70 µl of 1 mM 2,4-dinitro -
phenylhydrazine (1  mmol   l−1, Fluka, Buchs, St. Gallen) 
dissolved in 1  M HCl (Carl Roth, Karlsruhe, Germany), 
followed by incubation for 20  min at room tempera -
ture. Following the addition of 70  µl of 4  M NaOH the 
absorption was measured at 570  nm (TECAN infinite ® 
200 plate reader) to quantify the remaining pyruvate. As 
amino donors β-homophenylalanine, β-phenylalanine, 
β-homoalanine, β-leucine and 4-aminopentanoic acid 
(all purchased from TCI, Tokyo, Japan) were used. Since 
pyruvate and the amino donor react in a 1:1 stoichiom -
etry, the amount of deaminated amino donor was deter -
mined. The specific activity of StoTA was calculated from 
the amount of deaminated amino donor, referred to the 
reaction time and expressed in µmol *  min−1 * µg−1.

Mutant enzymes with higher activity than that of the 
wild type were used for further tests to determine the 
optimal pH value and the temperature stability. The 
determination of pH optimum and temperature stabil -
ity was similar to the activity assay. For the pH optimum, 
different buffers between pH 2 and pH 10 (Additional 
file 1: Table S3) were used instead of the standard buffer, 
while β-homophenylalanine was used as amino donor. 
To determine temperature stability, aliquots of the puri -
fied enzymes were stored for 60 min at 30–90 °C, in 10 °C 
steps before performing the activity assay. To determine 
the temperature optimum, the activity was measured for 
30 min at 30–80 °C, again in 10 °C steps. Tests for pH and 
temperature optimum and temperature stability were 
performed with β-homophenylalanine as amino donor.
In silico structure prediction
The structures of the mutant enzymes were predicted by 
using AlphaFold (Jumper et al. 2021) on a colab (Mirdita 
et al. 2021) notebook (https:// colab. resea rch. google. com/ 
github/  sokry  pton/  Colab  Fold/ blob/  v1.2.  0/ Alpha  Fold2. 
ipynb). For the wild type and each mutant, the number of 
calculated models was reduced to four, all other settings 
were used at default values. The ‘use template’ function 
was not used. For the illustrations (Additional file  1: Fig-
ure S2), the models with the best rank were used.
Results
In silico modelling
Comparing the in silico modelled structure of the wild 
type enzyme with the crystal structure, we found both 
structures to be very similar (Fig.  4). This indicates the 
high reliability of the in silico modelling procedure which 
showed that all mutant enzyme had the same structure, 
no differences in folding could be observed (see Addi -
tional file 1).
Modification of the active center of StoTA
The substitution of I283 and I284 in the catalytic domain 
by glutamine resulted in a decrease of activity by approxi-
mately 54% with β-homoalanine, a loss of approximately 
49% with β- phenylalanine and an almost complete loss 
of activity with 4-aminopentanoic acid and β-leucine. 
The remaining activity against β-homophenylalanine was 
only 76.4% compared to the wild type enzyme. Exchang -
ing T317 with valine led to a loss of activity. T317V was 
not active with β-homophenylalanine, β-homoalanine 
and β-leucine. With β- phenylalanine the remaining 
activity was only 26.3%, compared to the wild type. Only 
with 4-amino-pentanoic acid T317V showed a similar 
activity as the wild type. Consequently, the approach to 
modify the active center was not continued.
Modification of the proposed signature sequence motif 
in StoTA
The replacement of 4 amino acids was necessary to adapt 
StoTA to a proposed motif (Crismaru et al. 2013) (Fig. 3). At 
all 15 different variants of StoTA were generated, the vari-
ants were: S17P , T38V, Y47T, N70E, S27P|T38V, S17P|Y47T, 
S17P|N70E, T38V|Y47T, T38V|N70E, Y47T|N70E, 
S17P|T38V|Y47T, S17P|T38V|N70E, S17P|Y47T|N70E, 
T38V|Y47T|N70E and S17P|T38V|Y47T|N70E. Pre-tests 
with crude extracts from all variants were performed with 
β-homo-phenylalanine. Seven variants (marked with an 
asterisk in Fig. 5) which had a higher activity were used for 
further characterization. In the ongoing experiments puri-
fied enzymes were used. The specific activities, as well as sev-
eral biochemical properties are given in Tables 1 and 2.
Temperature stability, temperature optimum 
and pH-optimum
The modified versions of StoTA retained their activities 
also at higher temperatures. Like the wild type enzyme, 
the N70E variant was stable for 60 min at up to 60 °C, 
while the remaining mutants were stable for 60 min at 
up to 50  °C. In most mutants, the optimum tempera -
ture was lower than for the wild type, i.e. 60 °C. For the 
mutants S17P , N70E, S17P|T38V and S17P|T38V|Y47T 
this optimum was only 40  °C, for mutant T38V|Y47T 
46  °C and for mutant Y47T 48  °C. Only T38V had a 
similar temperature optimum as the wild type.
Amino acid substitutions in StoTA had no notewor -
thy effect on the pH optimum. Both wild type enzyme 
and the variants Y47T, N70E, S17P|T38V, T38V|Y47T 
and S17P|T38V|Y47T worked best at a pH value of 8. 
Only T38V and S17P showed a shift of their pH opti -
mum to pH 7.

Discussion
Modification of the active center of StoTA
In general, StoTA was modified in two ways. We first 
focused on the active center, in which a lysine residue at 
position 282 (K282) is part of the catalytic domain that 
performs a nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl group of 
PLP to form a Schiff’s base (Crismaru et al. 2013). Under 
physiological conditions, the amino group of the side -
chain of lysine is protonated, which makes it a weaker 
nucleophile. To prevent this protonation, the environ -
ment of K282 was made more alkaline. For this purpose, 
two amino acids in the vicinity of the catalytic lysine 
(I283 and I284) were replaced by glutamine. The second 
modification concerned the replacement of an interacting 
threonine residue (T317), which by forming a hydro -
gen bond to K282, might pull the latter away from PLP 
(Fig. 6). To confirm this, T317 was substituted by valine 
and the resulting conformational changes predicted by 
structural modelling (Additional file 1: Figure S2).
In general, StoTA variants with substitutions in the 
active center showed a similar or lower activity as the 
wild type enzyme (Fig.  5). T317V was not active at 
all with β-homophenylalanine, β-homoalanine and 
β-leucine. Compared to the unmodified enzyme, the 
activity with β-phenylalanine also decreased to 26.3%. 
Only with 4-amino-pentanoic acid T317V showed a sim -
ilar activity as the wild type. This confirms that residue 
T317 should be part of the suggested motif (Crismaru 
et  al. 2013), or even the active center. T317 of chain A 
is proposed to interact with K282 of chain B, and vice 
versa (Fig.  6). Assuming that T317 is important for the 
dimerization of the enzyme, a loss of T317 will lead to a 
more unstable and less active protein complex. Amongst 
at least five other residues, T317 is also involved in PLP 
binding (Kwon et  al. 2019). This could be another rea -
son for the loss of activity, if the missing hydrogen bond 
between T317 and the phosphate group of PLP leads 
to an incorrect binding of the co-factor. Another pos -
sibility is that T317 is not drawing K282 away from the 
active center but is bending or stabilizing K282 in a posi -
tion where it can bind the keto group of PLP or another 
substrate.
Modification of the proposed signature sequence motif 
in StoTA
In the second approach, StoTA was modified to match 
the proposed signature sequence motif that allows ami -
notransferases converting aromatic β-amino acids 
(Crismaru et  al. 2013). A blast search (Altschul et  al. 
1997) of the putative motif sequence against the StoTA 
sequence revealed that only four substitutions are

required to fit StoTA to the proposed motif (Fig. 3). These 
were S17P , T38V, Y47T and N70E. We generated fifteen 
different variants for this type of modification. Four of 
those carried a single amino acid substitution, six car -
ried two substitutions, four carried three substitutions, 
and one variant carried all four substitutions. Some of 
the modifications of StoTA led to an increased activity, 
emphasizing the importance of some of the amino acids 
in the proposed motif. Several mutants, which were made 
to adapt StoTA to the motif, had comparable activities to 
the wild type, others showed different activity levels.
The double substitution mutant T38V|N70E led to a 
loss of activity, showing approximately 75% activity with 
4-aminopentanoic acid and β-phenylalanine and only 
35% with β-leucine, while β-homophenylalanine and 
β-homoalanine were deaminated at almost the same 
velocity as with the wild type. In contrast, the double 
mutant, S17P|T38V showed a strong increase in activ -
ity. Depending on the amino donor, S17P|T38V displayed 
a 5.4 to 9.2-fold higher activity compared to the wild 
type. Also, T38V|Y47T was 3.8–10.5 times more active 
than the wild type. A strongly enhanced activity with 
all tested substrates was also found in the single mutant 
Y47T. Depending on the amino donor, the specific activ -
ity increased by 5.0–7.0 times compared to the wild type. 
This might be due to the fact that threonine has a less 
bulky side chain than tyrosine making it easier for a sub -
strate molecule to enter the active center.
Overall, the double mutant S17P|T38V had the high -
est activity of all StoTA variants with all substrates, 
except for β-leucine. With β-leucine the double mutant 
T38V|Y47T fared best with a 10.5 times enhanced activ -
ity compared to the wild type. Interestingly, as single 
replacement T38V had a lower activity than the wild type 
for all substrates except β-leucine, while S17P had lower 
or similar activities with all substrates. Together, how -
ever, these substitutions exerted a strong influence on the 
enzyme activity. This is somewhat surprising consider -
ing that T38 seems too far away from either S17 or Y47 
to provoke an interaction. The increase of activity must 
have other reasons, a difference in protein folding can be 
excluded based on in silico folding.
Mutant StoTA in which N70 was replaced by gluta -
mate had a 9.1% loss of activity with 4-aminopenta -
noic acid thus revealing the importance of asparagine 
at position 70 for transforming γ-amino acids. Regard -
ing β-amino acids, a different influence was observed. 
All β-amino acids were converted faster in com -
parison to the wild type (β-homoalanine + 29.3%, 
β-leucin + 191.5%, β-phenylalanine +  94.6% and 
β-homophenylalanine + 33.7%). The motif proposed 
by (Crismaru et  al. 2013) was originally suggested 
only for aromatic amino acids. However, as observed

here, fitting StoTA to the motif had a high impact on 
the activity with a branched chained amino acid and 
a minor impact on the activity with aromatic amino 
acids. This shows that the motif can be used for non-
aromatic ω-Tas too. N70 is located close to the phos -
phate group of bound PLP , where it may interact with 
the phosphate of the bound PLP (Fig.  7). In the vicinity 
of N70, R36 might be the residue, which binds the car -
boxyl group of the substrate to hold it in the p-pocket. 
Exchanging N70 by glutamate obviously alters the 
interactions between this residue and PLP or R36. The 
altered interaction appears to be beneficial for some 
substrates, but disadvantageous for others.
Depending on the amino donor the quadruple mutant, 
S17P|T38V|Y47T|N70E, showed only 8.6–81.4% residual 
activity, suggesting that not all residues in the proposed 
motif are equally important. The highest gains of activ -
ity were achieved in the mutants Y47T, S17P|T38V and 
T38V|Y47T. Additionally, these mutants have a lower 
temperature optimum, ranging between 40 and 50  °C 
instead of 60 °C. This is relevant for industrial use, since 
a lower temperature optimum requires less energy thus 
reducing production costs.
Previously, the activity with β-phenylalanine was 
improved by site-directed mutagenesis of an ω-TA from 
Caulobacter crescentus (Hwang et al. 2008). Two variants 
of this enzyme, N285A and V227G showed a three and 
twofold activity increase, respectively, compared to the 
wild type. On the other hand, these variants had a four 
and twofold lower activity with β-homoalanine (Hwang 
et  al. 2008). By introducing two mutations, (Cho et  al. 
2008) optimized the activity of an ω-TA from Vibrio fluvi-
alis against aromatic and aliphatic amines. Depending on 
the amino donor, W57G had a 2- to 40-fold higher activ -
ity with aromatic amines and a 5- to 19-fold higher activ -
ity with aliphatic amines. In the second variant, W147G 
the activity with aromatic amines ranged between 
0.8-fold to 14-fold relative to the wild type, while the 
activity with aliphatic amines ranged between 0.9- and 
6-fold (Cho et al. 2008). These results are comparable to 
those of the best variants obtained in the present study. 
Although none of our variants reached a 40-fold activ -
ity gain as obtained for the V. fluvialis enzyme for one 
substrate (Cho et al. 2008), the best variants produced in 
this work showed a consistent activity rate across all sub -
strates tested.
Specific activity with different substrates
All variants of StoTA catalyzed the deamination of all 
tested substrates. The activities were measured with 
β-homophenylalanine, β-homoalanine, 4-aminopenta -
noic acid, β-leucine and β-phenylalanine. The highest 
specific activity with β-homophenylalanine was observed 
with the S17P|T38V variant in which 1  µg protein was 
able to convert 3.211 ± 0.009 µmol β-homo-phenylalanine 
in 1  min, which is defined as U  µg −1. Y47T has a quite 
similar activity, 3.007 ± 0.017  U  µg −1, and T38V|Y47T 
was able to deaminate 2.305 ± 0.026  µmol β-homo-
phenylalanine per minute.
For β-homoalanine, S17P|T38V achieved the highest 
specific activity, namely 2.226 ± 0.208  U  µg−1, followed 
by Y47T, 1.981 ± 0.043  U  µg−1 and T38V|Y47T with a 
specific activity of 1.591 ± 0.112  U  µg−1. With 4-amin -
opentanoic acid, S17P|T38V was the only variant with a 
specific activity above 1  U  µg −1 (1.146 ± 0.037  U  mg−1). 
With an activity of 1.369 ± 0.080  U  µg−1, T38V|Y47T 
had the highest specific activity of all variants with 
β-leucine followed by S17P|T38V with a specific activity 
of 1.056 ± 0.008 U µg−1. Also, in case of β-phenylalanine, 
S17P|T38V had the highest specific activity, followed by 
T38V|Y47T.
Taken together, the present study shows that several 
biochemical properties of StoTA could be successfully 
improved by a rational design based on a previously pro -
posed signature sequence motif for aminotransferases 
converting aromatic β-amino acids. Not all modifications 
lead to a higher enzyme activity, but 7 out of 17 variants 
(S17P , T38V, Y47T, N70E, S17P|T38V, T38V|Y47T and 
S17P|T38V|Y47T) showed a higher specific activity with 
at least one substrate. Among all variants, three modifi -
cations, Y47T, S17P|T38V and T38V|Y47T not only had, 
depending on the amino donor, an approx. 4–10.5 times 
higher activity than the wild type, the same mutants also 
had a lower optimal temperature of 40–50  °C. These 
properties make these three variants valuable candi -
dates for industrial processes. Especially, S17P|T38V is 
a very promising modification, it has the highest specific 
activities with β-homophenylalanine, β-homoalanine, 
4-aminopentanoic acid and β-phenylalanine of all tested 
variants and can be used to produce these amino acids.

are shown and named
Page 10 of 11Wegner et al. AMB Express          (2023) 13:117 
Additionally, S17P|T38V has a temperature optimum of 
only 40 °C, which is 20 °C lower than for the wild type, 
which makes this variant even more suitable for indus -
trial processes. Only for the production of β-leucine, 
T38V|Y47T would be better because of the roughly 30% 
higher specific activity compared to S17P|T38V.
Besides the improvement of the catalytic activity, 
T317 could be identified as an essential residue. With -
out this residue, the enzyme loses most of its activity. 
The assumption that T317 is important for PLP binding 
is strengthened by the fact that PLP is not added to the 
model if the T317V variant is folded in silico by swiss-
model (https:// swiss model. expasy. org/ inter active) 
(Waterhouse et al. 2018), even if the unmodified struc -
ture, which includes PLP , is used as template.
