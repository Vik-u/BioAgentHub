Abstract
Chiral amines are important building blocks for the synthesis of pharmaceutical products, fine chemicals, and
agrochemicals. v-Transaminases are able to directly synthesize enantiopure chiral amines by catalysing the transfer of an
amino group from a primary amino donor to a carbonyl acceptor with pyridoxal 59-phosphate (PLP) as cofactor. In nature,
(S)-selective amine transaminases are more abundant than the (R)-selective enzymes, and therefore more information
concerning their structures is available. Here, we present the crystal structure of an (R)-v-transaminase from Aspergillus
terreus determined by X-ray crystallography at a resolution of 1.6 A˚. The structure of the protein is a homodimer that
displays the typical class IV fold of PLP-dependent aminotransferases. The PLP-cofactor observed in the structure is present
in two states (i) covalently bound to the active site lysine (the internal aldimine form) and (ii) as substrate/product adduct
(the external aldimine form) and free lysine. Docking studies revealed that (R)-transaminases follow a dual binding mode, in
which the large binding pocket can harbour the bulky substituent of the amine or ketone substrate and thea-carboxylate
of pyruvate or amino acids, and the small binding pocket accommodates the smaller substituent.

Introduction
Chiral amines are important building blocks for the synthesis of
pharmaceutical products, fine chemicals and agrochemicals [1–3].
Although there are several biocatalytic methods available for the
production of enantiopure chiral amines via kinetic resolution
using hydrolases, monoamine oxidases and v-transaminases [4–6],
and very recently two amino acid dehydrogenases were engineered
to amine dehydrogenases [7,8], to date v-transaminases are the
only natural enzymes that can directly synthesize enantiopure
chiral amines by asymmetric amination of prochiral ketones [9–
11].
v-Transaminases catalyse the transfer of an amino group from a
primary amino donor to a carbonyl acceptor with pyridoxal 5 9-
phosphate (PLP) as cofactor. The reaction can be divided into two
half reactions, where the amino group is first transferred to PLP to
form PMP (pyridoxamine phosphate) and then from PMP onto
the carbonyl group (Figure 1) [12]. In more detail, in the resting
state the aldehyde group of PLP forms a Schiff base with the side
chain amino group of an active site lysine of the protein (internal
aldimine). The amino group of the amino donor should be
oriented towards this aldimine to enable a transaldimination
reaction between the aldimine and the amine donor resulting in
the formation of a Schiff base between PLP and the amino donor.
This external aldimine is further converted to a ketimine by a 1,3-
prototropic shift. The released lysine acts as catalytic base in the
hydrolysis of the ketimine to a ketone, which then leaves the active
site. The formed PMP then reacts with a newly bound amine
acceptor (ketone) and undergoes reductive amination by reversing
the reaction described above. Thereby a new amine product is
formed and the internal aldimine is regenerated for another
reaction cycle.
For a long time mainly ( S)-selective v-transaminases were
known and extensively investigated [3,13–17]. Thus, ( R)-amines
were mainly prepared by kinetic resolution of racemic amines by
(S)-transaminases [18]. However, with this method ( R)-amines are
obtained only with a maximum yield of 50%. Recently, several
(R)-selective enzymes have been described and are under
investigation regarding their substrate scope [19–22]. Moreover,
successful engineering approaches have been described to broaden
the substrate scope of ( R)-transaminases towards bulky substrates
such as Sitagliptin [23]. The ( R)-v-transaminase from Aspergillus
terreus (AT-vTA) has been shown to preferably convert aliphatic
substrates (chain length up to at least six carbons) with high yield
and high enantioselectivity. However, the yields are significantly
lower with aromatic substrates, especially if the ketone is located
next to the aromatic ring, e.g. acetophenone, and decreases further
when the methyl is exchanged by larger groups [21,24].
Several structures of amino acid transaminases have been
determined to date. Only recently the first structures of ( S)-

selective amine transaminases from Vibrio fluvialis JS17 (PDB ID:
3NUI, 4E3Q and 4E3R, [13,25]), Paracoccus denitrificans (PDB ID:
4GRX, [26]), Pseudomonas putida (PDB ID: 3A8U, unpublished),
Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PDB ID: 4BQ0, 4B9B, 4B98, [27]), and
Chromobacterium violaceum (PDB ID: 4A6R, 4A6T, 4A6U, 4A72,
4AH3, 4BA4, 4BA5, [27,28]) have been determined or annotated
as ( S)-selective amine transaminases by analysing structures
deposited in the protein database (PDB ID: 3HMU, 3FCR,
3GJU, 3I5T, [29]). During the time of the submission of this
manuscript a paper describing the crystallization and preliminary
X-ray diffraction of the ( R)-selective amine transaminase from
Aspergillus fumigatus has been published [30] and its unreleased
structure has been deposited in the PDB (PDB ID: 4CHI).
In this paper we describe the structure of an ( R)-amine
aminotransferase (AT-vTA) from Aspergillus terreus.
Materials and Methods
Plasmid Construction
The gene (gene ID: 115385557) encoding the v-(R)-transam-
inase (XP_001209325, Uniprot: Q0C8G1, [19]) from Aspergillus
terreus, which was codon-optimized for E. coli, was ordered from
GeneArt (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The gene was
recloned into the pET28a( +) expression vector (Novagen/Merck,
Darmstadt, Germany) via the restriction sites NcoI and XhoIt o
introduce a C-terminal His-Tag. The pET28a-AT- vTA-CHis
construct was confirmed by sequencing (LGC Genomics, Berlin,
Germany) and transformed into the expression host E. coli BL21-
Gold(DE3) (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). Mutations were
introduced by overlap-extension PCR, and the PCR products
were ligated into the vector pMS470 D8 [31], using NdeI and
HindIII restriction sites (primer sequences see Table S1 in File S1).
The constructs were confirmed by sequencing. E. coli TOP10F’
cells (Life Technologies) were used as expression host.
Expression and Purification
E. coli BL21-Gold(DE3) cells harbouring pET28a-AT- vTA-
CHis and E. coli TOP10F’ cells containing the pMS470-AT-vTA
wild-type [24] and mutants thereof were grown in LB medium
(lysogeny broth) supplemented with kanamycin (50
mg/mL) or
ampicillin (100 mg/mL), respectively, at 37 uC. Expression of
recombinant protein was initiated by addition of 0.1 mM IPTG
to OD600 ,0.8 cultures, and cultivation was continued at 25 uC
for 20 h. Protein expression and localization was monitored by
SDS-PAGE. The cells were harvested, resuspended in cold buffer
A (20 mM sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 0.1 mM
PLP, 0.5 M NaCl and 10 mM imidazole) and disrupted by
sonication (Branson Sonifier S-250; 6 min, 80% duty cycle, 70%
output). The cell lysate was centrifuged for 1 h at 50,000 g to
remove unbroken cells and insoluble material. The cell free lysate
was filtered through a 0.45
mm syringe filter and incubated with Ni
SepharoseTM 6 Fast Flow resin (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden)
for 20 min. The Ni Sepharose TM resin was then filled into an
empty PD-10 column. Impurities were removed by washing with
buffer A containing 30 mM imidazole, followed by elution of the
bound protein with 300 mM imidazole in buffer A. Fractions were
analysed by SDS-PAGE, pooled and concentrated using Vivaspin
20 Centrifugal Filter Units (10,000 Da molecular-weight cut-off;
Sartorius) and desalted on PD-10 desalting columns (GE
Healthcare) into 20 mM Tris/HCl, 200 mM NaCl, pH 7. The
samples were concentrated and frozen until further use.
Crystallization
The samples were purified by size-exclusion chromatography
(SEC) on a Superdex 200 GL 10/300 column (GE Healthcare)
equilibrated with a multi-component buffer system (L-malic acid/
MES/Tris pH 6.5, [32]) at 0.16buffer concentration immediately
before crystallization. Peak fractions were pooled, a part of it was
set aside and the rest was concentrated to 10 mg/mL using
0.5 mL Amicon Ultra 10K centrifugal filters (Millipore) and used
for crystallization trials. Two drops with a total volume of 600 nL
(1:1 ratio of protein solution to screen solution) were dispensed
using an Oryx8 protein crystallization robot (Douglas Instruments
Ltd) at room temperature (20 uC) into a SWISSCi three-well
crystallization plate in a sitting-drop vapour-diffusion experiment.
The drops consisted of (i) concentrated AT- vTA sample at
10 mg/mL or (ii) AT- vTA sample (pooled fractions after SEC) at
3.2 mg/mL and the Morpheus crystallization screen (Molecular
Dimensions, [33]). After the initial setup, the crystallization plate

was stored at 18 uC and visually inspected at time intervals.
Crystals began to appear within days and were harvested within a
week after the experiment set-up. Two conditions produced
crystals of sufficient size for structure determination: B02 with
10% w/v PEG 8000, 20% v/v ethylene glycol, 0.03 M of each
halide (sodium fluoride, sodium bromide, sodium iodide) in 0.1 M
MES/imidazole, pH 6.5, and H02 with 10% w/v PEG 8000,
20% v/v ethylene glycol, 0.2 M each amino acid (sodium L-
glutamate, DL-alanine, glycine, DL-lysine HCl, DL-serine) in
0.1 M MES/imidazole, pH 6.5. Data for structure determination
were collected from crystals harvested from condition H02 without
cryoprotection.
Data Collection, Processing and Structure Determination
A data set sufficient for structure determination was collected at
beam line PXIII (X06DA) of a third-generation synchrotron light
source, the Swiss Light Source (SLS) at the Paul Scherrer Institute.
The crystal diffracted to 1.63 A˚ as determined by the automated
data reduction software xia2 used for image processing (3d mode
with XDS and XSCALE used for direct image processing and
Scala for merging [34,35]). The initial molecular replacement
(MR) solution was obtained with PHASER (version 1.7.2_869,
[36]) using a multiple template ensemble. The ensemble was
constructed using phenix.ensembler [36] in automated mode from
related structures available from the PDB data bank, which were
identified by sequence similarity. The initial solution was
automatically rebuild with the AutoBuild Wizard from the Phenix
suite and further refined with phenix.refine [36], and manual
building cycles with Coot [37]. The final refinement round was
performed with phenix.refine version 1.8.3–1479. Atomic coordi-
nates and structure factors have been deposited in the Protein
Data Bank (PDB ID: 4CE5).
Docking
Ligand docking calculations were performed using Glide from
the Schro¨dinger 2012 software package (Glide version 5.8,
Schro¨dinger, LLC, New York, [38]) in extra precision mode with
extended sampling. The AT- vTA crystal structure was prepared
using the protein preparation wizard by removing bound ligands
and alternate amino acid conformations, adding and optimizing
hydrogens and modelling of missing side chains. Pro-( R) and -( S)
conformations of the acetophenone-aldimine structure were
sketched in Maestro and parameterized for the OPLS/aa force
field. The resulting ligand structures were minimized using a
steepest descent method before a conformational search was
performed yielding the lowest energy conformers that were further
used for the subsequent docking protocols. Visualization was done
using Maestro (version 9.3, Schro ¨dinger, LLC) and PyMOL
(version 1.5.0.5, www.pymol.org).
Structure Analysis
The refined AT- vTA structure along with the template
structures used for molecular replacement identified using the
Swiss-Model Template Identification module (Figure S1 in File S1,
[39]) supplemented by a manual selection of other relevant
structures were aligned in the program Strap [40] using the
Superimpose_CE module (3D structure based alignment). The
alignment was then transferred to the program Jalview [41] for
further analysis. The phylogenetic tree was generated using the
program Archaeopteryx (Ver. 09813, [42]).
In order to identify the conserved regions of the AT- vTA
structure as well as to facilitate the amino acid conservation
analysis, the previously described structures were processed using
the phenix.ensembler module (ver. 1.8.3–1479, [36]). The
templates were separated into single polypeptide chains and
aligned according to the module’s standard settings. The
conserved portion of the structures was calculated with a standard
similarity threshold value of 3.0 A ˚. In order to reconstruct a
functional dimer in a consistent way for all proteins in the
alignment, chain A was duplicated and aligned to chain B of AT-
vTA for all analysed structures.
Activity Assay
The activities of AT- vTA wild-type and its variants were
determined using a standard photometric assay at 25 uC [43]
containing 0.25 mg/mL of total lysate protein, 0.1 mM PLP,
5m M (R)-a-methylbenzylamine and 5 mM pyruvate or 5 mM
butanal in 50 mM KPi, pH 7.5. The increase of acetophenone
was measured at 300 nm (extinction coeffi-
cient = 0.28 mM
21 cm21). As all tested variants expressed at the
same expression level as AT- vTA wild-type, it was feasible to
compare the activities of the cleared lysate without purifying the
different variants.
Results and Discussion
Transaminases belong to the fold classes I and IV of (PLP)–
dependent enzymes, which are classified into five different protein
folds [44,45]. Fold class I can be further divided into five
aminotransferase classes (I-V), which mainly contain L-amino acid
aminotransferases. In contrast to a-amino acid aminotransferases
(EC 2.6.1), which are ubiquitous enzymes, the small group of
amine transaminases also converts substrates lacking an a-
carboxylic acid moiety. Within fold class I the ( S)-selective v-
aminotransferases belong to class III. Fold class IV (PLP)–
dependent enzymes comprise D-amino acid aminotransferases
(D-ATA, EC 2.6.1.21), branched chain amino acid aminotrans-
ferases (BCAT, EC 2.6.1.42) and aminodeoxychorismate lyases
(ADCL). Based on homology models [23,46] of ( R)-selective v-
aminotransferases, which have been published recently, and due to
sequence similarities these enzymes are predicted to belong to fold
class IV as well.
The Overall Structure of AT-vTA
The crystal structure of AT- vTA was determined by X-ray
crystallography at a resolution of 1.6 A ˚. Crystallographic data
processing and structure refinement statistics are presented in
Table 1. The asymmetric unit contains two polypeptide chains
which form a stable dimer with a contact surface of 2198 A ˚
2
spanning 40 interface residues, which corresponds to 14.6% of the
total surface area (PDBSum, [47]). The interface contacts are
mostly van der Waals interactions (256 contacts) and hydrogen
bonds (18 contacts). All 325 residues are visible in the electron
density maps although the three N- and C-terminal residues of
both chains were refined with lower occupancy due to their
weaker defined electron density. No electron density was observed
for the C-terminal His-tag. The electron density in the active
centre was well defined where the PLP was expected to bind.
Furthermore, extra density was observed at the entrance to the
binding site suggesting the presence of a PLP adduct.
Compared to the closest homologous structures identified based
on sequence similarity using Swiss-Model Template Identification
(PDB ID: 2EIY, a putative branched chain amino acid amino-
transferase from Thermus thermophilus HB8, sequence identity: 26%,
unpublished) and direct 3D-structure comparison using the DALI
server (PDB ID: 1IYE, branched-chain amino acid aminotrans-
ferase from E. coli, [48]) AT-vTA exhibits the typical aminotrans-
ferase class IV fold (InterPro: IPR001544, Pfam: Pf01063)

consisting of alpha-beta elements including 2-layer sandwiches and
alpha-beta barrels. The above-mentioned structures align with the
AT-vTA structure with a Calpha RMSD of 1.58 A ˚ and 1.26 A˚,
respectively. The most significant difference between AT- vTA
and its related proteins is the N-terminal alpha-helix spanning the
initial 20 amino acids.
A phylogenetic analysis based on structure alignments of
selected related proteins suggests a closer relationship of the AT-
vTA to D-ATA represented by the structure of D-amino acid
aminotransferase of Bacillus sp. (PDB ID: 1A0G) (Figure S2 in File
S1).
Active Site
The electron density in the active site pocket is well defined and
interpreted as two distinct states: (i) free Lys180 and Lys180
covalently bound to the pyridoxal-5 9-phosphate (PLP) and (ii) N-
({3-hydroxy-2-methyl-5-[(phosphonooxy)methyl]pyridin-4-yl}-
methyl)-D-glutamic acid (ligand code: PGD). Both conformations
can be observed in each of the polypeptide chains with minor
differences in the occupancy. It has to be noted that the PLP-
amino acid adduct could also be interpreted as a combination of
any of the amino acids present in the used crystallisation condition
(sodium L-glutamate, DL-alanine, glycine, DL-lysine HCl, DL-
serine) as the observed density was clearly present, but rather
weakly defined. We have selected the glutamic acid adduct, as it
best illustrated the length of the observed density without
complicating the final structure interpretation.
The active site of each polypeptide chain is located on the
opposite side of the dimer with the entrance situated at the end of
the dimer interface. The entrance cavity is capped by a flexible
beta hairpin spanning 15 residues (121–136) thereby limiting the
access to the active site. However, none of the hairpin residues
belongs to the direct cofactor coordination sphere. There are a
total of 125 amino acids within a 12 A ˚ range from the cofactor,
117 belonging to chain A and 8 to chain B. Thereof, 20 amino
acids (aa) are located within 0–4 A ˚. 14 aa are found within a
distance of 4–6 A˚, 24 aa are 6–8 A˚ (including His55 from chain B)
away, and 67 aa are within a 8–12 A ˚ range, with Gln51, Phe53,
Met54, Ser56 and Arg128 (from chain B), as well as Gln183 and
Gly185 (from chain A) located along with His55 in the beta
hairpin region mentioned above (for a complete list see Table S2
in File S1). Roughly 50% out of those residues are located in the
conserved core region of AT- vTA (Figure 2A, compare Table S2
in File S1). Most of the residues located within a 4 A˚ range create
the lining of the cofactor binding site, with Lys180 directly
involved in the activation of the cofactor. Residues located
between 6–8 A˚ are responsible for creating the ‘bottom’ part of the
binding pocket while the top layer is created by the residues
located between 8–12 A˚ apart from the cofactor.
Amino acids of both subunits contribute to the formation of the
active site of the ( R)-transaminase from A. terreus, which is located
at the dimer interface of the two subunits (Figure 2B). These amino
acids are building two binding pockets as postulated to represent a
general feature of transaminases [9]. The small binding pocket is
lined by the amino acids Val62, Phe115, Thr274, Thr275 and
Ala276, which interact with the substrate (Figure 2C). The large
binding pocket is surrounded by the residues His55*, Tyr60,
Phe115, Glu117, Arg128*, Leu182 and Trp184, (*indicates that
the residues belongs to the other chain) (Figure 2D); thus,
hydrophobic residues and an arginine residue as described for
(S)-transaminases are present. The arginine residue points towards
the carboxylate group of the L-glutamate residue, which is bound
to the PMP in the active site.
PLP binding site. The electron density for the PLP cofactor
is well defined and the covalent imino bond to the active site
Lys180 residue is clearly visible.
The phosphate group is interacting through a network of
hydrogen bonds to the side chains of Arg79, Thr239 and Thr275,
the backbone amides of Val238, Thr239 and Thr275, and two
water molecules (Figure 2E). Similar hydrogen networks, which
were described as a general feature of the phosphate binding cup
of PLP-dependent enzymes [49] have also been observed for other
transaminases of both fold classes, in fold class IV, e.g. a D-amino
acid transaminase from Bacillus sp. YM-1 [50], a branched chain
amino acid transaminase from E. coli [48], and in fold class I, ( S)-
transaminases e.g. from P. denitrificans [26] or P. aeruginosa [27], or
the aromatic amino acid TA from P. denitrificans [51].
An interesting difference between the bindings of the phosphate
groups in the two fold classes is the involvement of a highly

interaction of the pyridinium nitrogen with a conserved aspartate
(fold I) or glutamate residue (fold IV), which helps to maintain the
pyridine ring in the protonated form providing resonance
stabilization of the carbanionic intermediate [52]. In AT- vTA,
Glu213 takes this role by forming a hydrogen bond between its
side chain carboxyl group and the nitrogen atom of the pyridine
ring. Glu213 in turn is stabilized by interaction with Arg169 as has
also been described for the D-ATA of Bacillus sp. [53] and
hydrogen bonding of the respective aspartate by a His residues is
also observed in fold class I transaminases [27,49]. The
importance of this glutamate residue has also been shown in the
D-ATAs by site-directed mutagenesis [54].
Flexible Loop
As mentioned above, the interdomain loop Thr121-Val136 of
chain B is located close to the active site of chain A and vice versa
and might function as a flexible lid at the entrance of the active
site. Indeed this loop contains several subsequent residues with
high B-factors (Arg128-Asp134) indicating a certain degree of
flexibility. Interestingly, this loop is not conserved among members
of fold class IV transaminases, (Figure S3 in File S1). Moreover,
the B-factors of the amino acids in the respective loop of BCATs
are much lower. Structural alignments showed that the loops are
shorter in many other structures of fold class IV proteins and have
different conformations (Figure 3). On the other hand, for the
BCAT from E. coli a flexible interdomain loop (Pro125-Glu136
corresponding to aa Pro145-Val157 in AT- vTA), which rear-
ranges upon substrate binding, was reported [48]. The B-factors of
this loop are not elevated in AT- vTA. Structural rearrangements
have also been described for the ( S)-selective transaminase from
Chromobacterium violaceum [28].
Docking
Docking of the pro-( R)- and ( S)-ligand conformations of the
planar acetophenone pyridoxal phosphate intermediate revealed
that only the pro-( R) conformer is able to bind to the active site of
AT-vTA in a productive binding mode allowing the attack of
Lys180 yielding the (R)-enantiomer of the final product (Figure 4A).
The hydrophobic aromatic substituent of acetophenone is located
in the large binding pocket defined by the mainly hydrophobic
residues His55, Tyr60, Phe115 and Trp184, and the methyl group
is located in the small binding pocket lined by Val62, Phe115,
Thr274, Thr275 and Ala276. To enable the fitting of the
acetophenone moiety of the pro-( S)-conformation into the large
and the small binding pockets without clashing, the PLP moiety
gets distorted moving it further away from Lys180. Moreover,
especially the phosphate group is displaced (Figure 4A).
Molecular docking of acetophenone-, propiophenone- and
butyrophenone-aldimine intermediates confirmed the experimen-
tal findings that the size of the small binding pocket influences the
binding of larger substrates [21,24], as butyrophenone can only fit
in the active site in a distorted conformation (Figure 4B).
The large binding pocket is open in one direction. This opening
leads to a short tunnel, through which the substrates can enter the
active site. As it is rather narrow it might influence the entry of
larger substrates (Figure S4 in File S1).
Enantioselectivity
In a recent review, enantiocomplementary enzymes were
classified into four different groups based on the position or
exchange of active site amino acids in relation to the protein fold
or a cofactor as reference [55]. For transaminases two of the
groups apply (see below). In group two the protein folds differ, but
a cofactor serves as reference point. The positions of the substrates’
substituents are exchanged. Group three comprises enzymes with
the same protein fold, but the binding sites of the substrates’
substituents are exchanged as in group two.
Binding mode. Lysine 180 in AT-vTA is located at the same
position as in the other fold class IV transaminases, BCATs and D-
ATAs (e.g. [48,50]) enabling proton transfer on the re-face of PLP
(Figure 5A). Moreover, the glutamate residue interacting with the
pyridoxal nitrogen and valine/isoleucine, arginine and threonine
residues interacting with the phosphate are conserved as well,
resulting in an almost identical position of PLP in these three
enzymes (Figure S5 in File S1). In contrast, the lysine is positioned
on the other side (si-face) of the PLP in fold class I proteins like ( S)-
TAs and L-aspartate aminotransferases resulting in a relation of
fold I and fold IV enzymes according to group two of
enantiocomplementary enzymes (Figure 5B) [55]. The situation
that in fold class IV the cofactor is bound in a site that is a mirror
image of the fold class I binding sites, so that the re rather than the
si-face is solvent exposed, has already been observed for amino
acid transferases almost 20 years ago [53].
In all fold class IV enzymes, the substrates bind at the same face
of PLP. Reversed enantioselectivity is achieved by the exchanged
localisation of the small and the large binding site and thus the
reversed position of the a-carboxylate and side chain of the
substrates in D-ATAs and BCATs resulting in either a D-( R)-
amino acid (D-ATAs), or an L-(S)-amino acid (BCAT). Whereas in
D-ATAs the small binding pocket accommodating the a-
carboxylate is located above the O3’ of PLP, in the BCATs the
respective small binding pocket is located above the phosphate
group of PLP (Table 2, Figure 5A, compare L-Ile-aldimine bound
in BCAT in blue and D-Ala-aldimine bound in D-ATA in brown)
[51]. This is in correspondence with group three of enantiocom-
plementary enzymes [55].
For BCATs, a dual substrate recognition for the binding of the
c-carboxylate of glutamate or hydrophobic substrates in the large
binding pocket without side-chain rearrangements of active site
amino acids has been postulated [19,48]. The large hydrophobic
binding pocket contains hydrophilic sites (e.g. the guanidino group
of Arg97, the hydroxy groups of Tyr31* and Tyr129, and the
main-chain NH group of Val109* in the BCAT of E. coli) close to
the solvent region, which interact with the c-carboxylate of L-
glutamate, but do not disturb the binding of hydrophobic
substrates e.g. of L-isoleucine, as the inner side of the pocket is
mainly hydrophobic. In contrast, in fold class I transaminases, e.g.
aspartate (AspTA) and aromatic amino acid transaminases
(AroAATA) [56,57], where the large binding pocket can also
harbour either an aromatic or an v-carboxylate substituent, a
different dual binding mode has been described. In the AspTA
from E. coli, Arg292 in the large binding pocket takes different
conformations depending on whether an aromatic or an acidic
amino acid binds. It undergoes a movement to a position where it
hydrogen-bonds with Asn142, if an aromatic substrate binds [56].
A similar rearrangement is observed in AroTAs [57].
Recently, Bornscheuer’s group used an in silico approach to
predict key features of a desired ( R)-v-transaminase by comparing
known crystal structures of BCATs and D-ATAs and identifying
conserved amino acids responsible for enantioselective substrate
binding, to postulate necessary differences in protein sequences to
switch the substrate specificity from a-amino acids to amines [19].
They identified a set of amino acids, which are conserved in a
group of highly similar proteins, which indeed displayed the
desired (R)-selectivity for amines [22].
In accordance with the proposal of Bornscheuer’s group that the
plausible ancestor of the (R)-specific amine transaminase should be
an L-(S)-selective BCAT, as, according to the CIP (Cahn-Ingold-
Crystal Structure of an (R)-v-Transaminase

Prelog) rule, the substitution of the carboxyl group of an L-amino
acid by a methyl group yields an ( R)-amine, the docking of the
acetophenone-aldimine into AT- vTA placed the methyl group in
the small binding pocket and the aromatic ring of the acetophe-
none in the large binding pocket (Figure 4A). Moreover, as in
BCATs the small binding pocket is located above the phosphate
group and the large binding pocket above the O3’ (Table 2,
Figure 6). Interestingly, L-glutamate is bound in the AT- vTA
structure in exactly the same position as in the BCAT from E. coli,
1IYE ([48], Figure 5A), with the c-carboxylate in the large binding
pocket and the a-carboxylate in the small binding pocket. Also
several other BCATs with bound substrate show the same
geometry (e.g. isoleucine in 1KT8, [58], Figure 5A). However,
as expected for an ( R)-selective enzyme, AT- vTA is able to use
and synthesize several D-amino acids such as D-alanine, D-serine,
D-homoalanine, D-threonine as substrates [24,46], instead of L-
amino acids like BCATs. Thus, the methyl group of ( R)-amines or
ketones and the a-carboxylate of amino or keto acids, cannot bind
to the same binding pocket, considering the general reaction
mechanism for transaminases and taking the priority rule of CIP
into account. The a-carboxylate in BCATs is coordinated by the
hydroxyl group of a highly conserved tyrosine residue (Y95 in E.
coli BCAT), which is activated by an adjacent arginine residue
(R97 in E. coli BCAT, Figure S6A in File S1). These two amino
acids are not present in AT- vTA (F115 and E117, respectively).
The other carboxylate oxygen can interact with the backbone
amide nitrogen atoms of two residues (e.g. T262 and A263 in E.
coli BCAT), which are also present in AT- vTA (T275 and A276).
However, an arginine or lysine residue in the second shell of
BCATs (R40 in E. coli BCAT), which is proposed to activate the
backbone amides via coordination with the adjacent carbonyl
groups, is missing in AT- vTA (S64). In summary, the small
binding pocket of AT- vTA and BCAT indeed differ significantly
as it was predicted by the group of Bornscheuer to enable the
binding of a methyl group instead of the a-carboxylate [19]. In
accordance with the complementary enantioselectivity of D-ATAs,
the a-carboxylate is bound in the binding pocket above the O3’ of
PLP interacting with conserved arginine, histidine and tyrosine
residues (Y31, R98, and His100 in the D-ATA from Bacillus sp.,
Figure S6B in File S1). A tyrosine residue is found at exactly the
same position in AT- vTA (Y60) and with His55 and Arg128
positive charged amino acids are present as well (for further
analysis see below).
The binding of L-glutamate in the active site of AT- vTA, with
its a-carboxylate located in the small binding pocket and the c-
carboxylate in the large binding pocket, might be an artefact of the
crystallization conditions (see above), which contain a mixture of
DL-amino acids. L-Glu does not serve as substrate for AT-vTA; it
would not be converted to the respective keto acid and remained

in the active site, whereas D-amino acids might have been
converted and thus could not be detected.
A different mode of binding than for BCATs must apply to
explain the ( R)-amine and D-amino acid selectivity of AT- vTA.
For (S)-omega-transaminases a different dual recognition mode
than for amino acid aminotransferases has been postulated, in
which the bulky substituent of the amine or ketone substrate and
the a-carboxylate of pyruvate or amino acids bind in the same
(large) binding pocket. In addition, there is a small binding pocket,
which prohibits the binding of substituents larger than an ethyl
group [16]. With detailed kinetic analysis and calculations of free
energies the same group could show that in the ( S)-transaminase
from P. denitrificans differences in kcat/Km values of different
substrates arise mainly from their different binding affinity than
from the catalytic turnover rate [59]. This binding mode was
recently also confirmed by analysing solved structures [26,29].
Docking of a-methylbenzylamine into the structure of an v-amino
acid:pyruvate aminotransferase (PDB ID: 3A8U) from Pseudomonas
putida indicated that several aromatic amino acids (Tyr 23, Phe88*,
Tyr152) in the large binding pocket establish a hydrophobic
environment enabling the binding of hydrophobic substituents. In
addition, an arginine, R414, is present, which is proposed to
interact with carboxylate groups of keto acid substrates [60].
These four residues of the large binding pocket are conserved in
other (S)-transaminase structures from P. denitrificans, V. fluvialisand
C. violaceum as well as in four recently annotated structures
(3HMU, 3IST, 3FCR and 3GJU, [29]). Interestingly, Arg417 in
3HMU adopts two different conformations in the two monomers.
In subunit A it is oriented away from the PLP and enlarges the
binding pocket [60]. Molecular modelling of carboxylic substrates
and aromatic substrates revealed that the flexibility of this arginine
residue is most likely responsible for the substrate promiscuity. In
the crystal structure of P. denitrificans the Arg415 residues is found
in two orientations dependent on the presence (Arg points
outwards) or absence (Arg points in the active site) of the substrate
[26].
In AT- vTA, Arg128 is part of the flexible loop with high B-
factors as outlined above. Interestingly, the side chain is slightly
kinked out of the active site to create room for the binding of the
L-glutamate or alternatively acetophenone, as shown in the
docking. Thus, it is probable that Arg128 can move closer to
the active site and facilitate the binding of the a-carbonyl of
pyruvate in the active site either by changing its conformation or
by movement of the flexible loop (Figure S7 in File S1).
The AT- vTA mutant R128A showed only reduced activity
with pyruvate and ( R)-a-methylbenzylamine ( ,37% of wild-type
activity (0.8 U/mg), Figure 7) and with butanal the activity was
reduced as well (67% of wild-type activity (0.1 U/mg) Figure 7).
This is in contrast to the observation in several ( S)-TAs, where
mutations of the above-mentioned arginines resulted in signifi-
cantly decreased activity towards pyruvate, whereas butanal served
still as substrate [61]. The remaining activity of these Arg mutants
in ( S)-TAs was explained with the additional interaction of the
carboxylate group with a Trp and Phe residue. In AT- vTA,
Tyr60 and Trp184 may play this role. The mutation of these
residues resulted in diminished (Y60A) or completely abolished
activity (Y60A, W184A and W184F) with both substrates,
pyruvate and butanal (data not shown). Thus, it can well be the
case that the hydrophobic aromatic residues in fact interact with
the aromatic ring of the methylbenzylamine and the mutations
result in inefficient binding of methylbenzylamine.

Conclusion
After a detailed analysis of the structure of the ( R)-selective v-
transaminase from Aspergillus terreus including a comparison to
other members of the fold class IV family and considering the dual
binding mode reported for ( S)-transaminases [16,61], we propose,
that ( R)-transaminases follow a similar dual binding mode, in
which the large binding pocket can harbour the bulky substituent
of the amine or ketone substrate and the a-carboxylate of pyruvate
or amino acids, and the small binding pocket accommodates the
smaller substituent. Co-crystallization experiments with various
substrates are currently on-going to obtain a deeper insight into
the substrate binding mode.
