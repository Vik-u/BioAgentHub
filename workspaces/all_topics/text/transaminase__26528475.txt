and their industrial applications

This article will discuss the importance of specific extremophilic enzymes for applications 
in industrial biotechnology. It will specifically address those enzymes that have applica-
tions in the area of biocatalysis. Such enzymes now play an important role in catalyzing a 
variety of chemical conversions that were previously carried out by traditional chemistry. 
The biocatalytic process is carried out under mild conditions and with greater specificity. 
The enzyme process does not result in the toxic waste that is usually produced in a 
chemical process that would require careful disposal. In this sense, the biocatalytic 
process is referred to as carrying out “green chemistry” which is considered to be envi-
ronmentally friendly. Some of the extremophilic enzymes to be discussed have already 
been developed for industrial processes such as an 
l-aminoacylase and a γ-lactamase. 
The industrial applications of other extremophilic enzymes, including transaminases, 
carbonic anhydrases, dehalogenases, specific esterases, and epoxide hydrolases, are 
currently being assessed. Specific examples of these industrially important enzymes that 
have been studied in the authors group will be presented in this review.

iNTRODUCTiON
A problem with using enzymes for industrial biotransformation reactions is often their inherent 
stability to the conditions employed. During industrial processes, the enzymes are often exposed to a 
different environment to their natural conditions within the cell such as non-natural substrates, high 
substrate concentrations, non-aqueous conditions, and extremes of pH. When using non-natural 
substrates, enzymes from different classes can be found to accept the same substrate such as the case 
with racemic γ-lactam described below. Enzymes can also carry out “side reactions” when used at a 
different pH than that found inside the cell.
The availability of new genome sequences makes the search for new industrial enzymes a rela -
tively easy process. Also the isolation of metagenomes from extremophilic sources provides DNA 
from potentially uncultivatable organisms. However, the identification of specific enzymes from 
this resource is only as good as the current bioinformatic analyses and many novel or unknown 
activities can be missed. It is therefore important to also screen genomic libraries against substrates of 
commercial interest for specific biocatalytic activities especially if turnover of a non-natural substrate 
is required.
The diversity which “nature” provides for extremophilic environments of temperature, pH, 
acidity, alkalinity, pressure, and salinity can be exploited to discover new novel and potentially 
robust enzymes that are better suited for use in industrial applications. The increased number

of extremophilic genomes and metagenomes that can now 
be sequenced by next-generation sequencing technologies 
provides an ever expanding resource for identification of new 
enzymes.
The mechanism of protein stabilization under extreme condi-
tions varies depending on the microbial species and level of adap-
tion required for survival in the host organism. For the acidophiles 
and alkalophiles, it is only the proteins exported from the cell that 
have to be stable under the extreme pHs of the growth environ -
ment, since the proteins inside the cell do not have to withstand 
these extreme conditions as the intracellular pH is maintained 
around pH 5.0–6.0. Some general features of enzyme stability 
have been observed from the analysis of the three-dimensional 
structures of enzymes isolated from extreme environments of 
high temperatures have been reviewed by Littlechild et al. (2013).
Many archaeal and bacterial enzymes isolated from extre-
mophiles have general applications in molecular biology such 
as the hyperthermophilic Pyrococcus polymerase enzyme which 
has improved fidelity in PCR reactions when compared to 
thermophilic bacterial polymerase enzymes. Other thermophilic 
enzymes are of great importance to the breakdown of biomass 
and other materials such as waste plastics in order to contribute 
to a circular economy where nothing is wasted.
This review will concentrate on several specific examples of 
interest to the author where extremophilic enzymes are currently 
playing an important role as biocatalysts for the pharmaceutical 
and fine chemical industries.
SPeCiFiC eXAMPLeS
The Sulfolobus solfataricus γ-Lactamase 
enzyme
An enzyme from the thermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfatari-
cus MT4 can use the bicyclic synthon (rac)- γ-lactam (2-azabi-
cyclo[2.2.1]hept-5-en-3-one) as a substrate to obtain a single 
enantiomer of the γ-bicyclic lactam product which is an impor -
tant building block for the anti-HIV compound, Abacavir (Taylor 
et al., 1993). This (+)-γ-lactamase was identified in the Sulfolobus 
strain by screening colonies from an expression library for their 
ability to produce the amino acid product when supplied with 
the racemic γ-lactam. Screening was carried out using genomic 
libraries using a filter paper overlay. The colonies on the plate that 
were active showed a brown coloration of the filter paper when the 
amino acid was produced which had been soaked in ninhydrin 
stain. Another non-thermophilic bacterial (+)-γ-lactamase that 
can also carry out this reaction has been identified within the bac-
terial Delftia species (PDB code 2WKN, Gonsalvez et al., 2001 ). 
This enzyme is of a different class, structure, and mechanism from 
the archaeal enzyme but both can use the non-natural γ-lactam as 
a substrate. It is related to the bi-zinc containing metalloprotease 
formamidase by analysis using the SCOP2 database ( Andreeva 
et al., 2014). A third (−)-γ-lactamase of opposite stereoselectivity 
is related to a α/β hydrolase fold esterase enzyme which can also 
carry out the side reaction of bromination at pH 4.0 and was 
referred to as a non-cofactor containing bromoperoxidase (Line 
et al., 2004).
The Sulfolobus (+)-γ-lactamase has been cloned and overex -
pressed in Escherichia coli and purified to homogeneity (Toogood 
et al., 2004). The molecular mass of the monomer was estimated 
to be 55 kDa by SDS-PAGE, which is consistent with the calcu -
lated molecular mass of 55.7 kDa. The native molecular weight 
was 110  kDa as determined by gel filtration chromatography, 
indicating that the enzyme exists as a dimer in solution. The puri-
fied enzyme has been crystallized with a view to determining its 
three-dimensional structure.
This thermostable archaeal ( +)-γ-lactamase has a high 
sequence homology to the signature amidase family of enzymes. 
It shows similar inhibition to the amidase enzymes with benzo -
nitrile, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, and heavy metals such 
as mercury, and it is activated by thiol reagents. Alignment 
of the amino acid sequences of the ( +)-γ-lactamase from S. 
solfataricus with four amidases from Pseudomonas chlororaphis 
B23, Rhodococcus sp. N-771, Rhodococcus erythropolis  N-774, 
and Rhodococcus rhodochrous J shows it has a 41–44% sequence 
identity to these enzymes. The amidases belong to the signature 
amidase family as they all contain the consensus sequence 
GGSS(S/G)GS. The amino acid sequence of the γ-lactamase 
contains the highly conserved putative catalytic residues aspartic 
acid and serine but not the highly conserved cysteine residue 
(Kobayashi et al., 1997).
The purified ( +)-γ-lactamase enzyme has been immobilized 
as a cross-linked, polymerized enzyme preparation and packed 
into microreactors (Hickey et  al., 2009
). The thermophilic 
(+)-γ-lactamase retained 100% of its initial activity at the assay 
temperature, 80°C, for 6 h and retained 52% activity after 10 h, 
indicating the advantage of the immobilization. The free enzyme 
began to display a reduction in activity after 1 h at 80°C. The higher 
stability of the immobilized enzyme provided the advantage that 
it could be used to screen many compounds in a microreactor 
system without denaturation.
l-Aminoacylase and Pyroglutamyl 
Carboxyl Peptidase from the Thermophilic 
Archaeon Thermococcus litoralis
Many pharmaceutically active compounds contain nitrogen 
and can be derived from amino acids (Drauz, 1997). These 
compounds need to be optically pure, which can be achieved 
by the use of specific l or d aminoacylase enzymes. There is a 
large growth in the use of unnatural amino acids, for example, 
l-tert-leucine is a precursor to many pharmaceutically active 
compounds such as the antitumor compounds ( Bommarius 
et al., 1998). A thermophilic archaeal l-aminoacylase has been 
cloned and overexpressed from the archaeon Thermococcus 
litoralis (Toogood et al., 2002a). The enzyme was identified from 
a Thermococcus DNA expression library which gave a positive 
hit for esterase activity. This esterase gene was later found to 
code for a pyroglutamyl carboxyl peptidase, which is a novel 
cysteine protease that cleaves the pyroglutamyl group from the 
N-terminus of biologically important peptides. The enzyme 
has been characterized both biochemically and structurally and 
demonstrated to be a new class of cysteine protease ( Singleton 
et al., 1999). The commercial use of this enzyme is to cleave the

pyroglutamyl group from “blocked” peptides allowing them to 
be N-terminally sequenced. The Thermococcus  protease forms 
a tetrameric structure held together by disulfide bonds between 
the dimer subunit interface and is stabilized by an unusual 
hydrophobic core at the center of the tetrameric structure. This 
unusual feature is formed from four two-stranded antiparallel 
β-sheets, one from each subunit. The sheets are built from the 
hydrophobic amino acid residues Phe–Phe–Leu–Leu (Figure 1). 
This hydrophobic insertion is unique to the T. litoralis enzyme, 
with no equivalent structure seen in other bacterial or archaeal 
pyroglutamyl carboxyl peptidase enzymes (Singleton et al., 1999).
The Thermococcus l-aminoacylase enzyme which was 
identified next to the novel cysteine protease and has an 82% 
sequence identity to an l-aminoacylase from Pyrococcus furiosus 
(Tanimoto et al., 2008) and 45% sequence identity to a carboxy-
peptidase from another thermophilic archaeon S. solfataricus . 
The Thermococcus enzyme is not inhibited by conventional 
aminoacylase inhibitors such as mono-tert -butyl malonate 
so appears to be novel. It is thermostable, with a half-life of 
25  h at 70°C and has an optimal activity at 85°C in Tris-HCl, 
pH 8.0. This T. litoralis l-aminoacylase has a broad substrate 
specificity preferring the amino acids: Phe  ≫ Met > Cys > Ala 
~ Val >  Tyr > Propargylglycine  >  Trp > Pro > Arg. A column 
bioreactor containing the recombinant Thermococcus  enzyme 
has been constructed by immobilization onto Sepharose beads. 
This bioreactor showed no loss of activity towards the substrate 
N-acetyl-dl-Trp after 5 days and 32% of the activity remained 
after 40 days at 60°C (Toogood et al., 2002b ). The enzyme has 
more recently been immobilized by covalent attachment to an 
epoxy resin formed in channels of a microreactor allowing a 
“flow-through” procedure to be used (Ngamsom et al., 2010). This

structural elements are shown in a different color for each subunit. The

can be used for rapid substrate screening of the l-aminoacylase 
and eliminates potential substrate and product inhibition. It has 
been shown in pilot-scale biotransformation reactions using the 
substrate N-acetyl-dl-propargylglycine that this enzyme does 
show substrate inhibition (Toogood et al., 2002a).
The Thermococcus l-aminoacylase enzyme is now being 
used for multiton commercial production of l-amino acids and 
their analogs by Chirotech/Dow Pharma and more recently by 
Chirotech/Dr Reddys (Holt, 2004). A racemase enzyme has been 
developed in order to convert the isomer not used by the enzyme 
to the form that is used which can enable a more efficient process 
resulting in a 100% conversion of the racemic substrate (Baxter 
et al., 2012).
There are differences in substrate specificity between the 
Thermococcus l-aminoacylase and another thermophilic 
archaeal enzyme from Pyrococcus  species. The substrate 
N-acetyl-l-phenylalanine is the most favorable substrate for the 
Thermococcus enzyme; however, this substrate is not used by the 
Pyrococcus l-aminoacylase (Tanimoto et al., 2008).
Carboxyl esterase from a Thermophilic 
Bacterium Thermogutta terrifontis
Esterases are a class of commonly used enzymes in industrial appli-
cations. This is partially due to their inherent stability in organic 
solvents and the ability to freely reverse the enzyme reaction from 
hydrolysis to synthesis by the elimination of the water that is used 
during the hydrolysis mechanism. The carboxyl esterases catalyze 
the hydrolysis of the ester bond of relatively small water-soluble 
substrates. A new carboxyl esterase (TtEst) has been identified in a 
recently identified thermophilic bacterium Thermogutta terrifontis 
from the phylum Planctomycetes. This enzyme has been cloned and 
overexpressed in E. coli (Sayer et al., 2015). The enzyme has been 
characterized biochemically and shown to have activity towards 
small p-nitrophenyl (pNP) carboxylic esters with optimal activity 
for pNP-propionate. The TtEst enzyme is very thermostable and 
retained 95% of its activity after incubation for 1 h at 80°C. The 
enzyme has been crystallized and its structure determined without 
ligands bound in the active site and in complex with a substrate 
analog d-malate and the product acetate. The bound ligands in the 
structure have allowed the identification of the carboxyl and alco-
hol binding pockets in the enzyme active site (Figure 2). It has also 
allowed a detailed comparison with structurally related enzymes 
that has given insight into how differences in the catalytic activity 
can be rationalized based on the properties of the amino acid 
residues in different active site pockets. An overall comparison 
of the alcohol binding pocket in TtEst with the equivalent pocket 
in the 3-oxoadipate-enol lactonase from Burkholderia xenovorans 
(PcaD) with 29% sequence identity (PDB code 2XUA) ( Bains 
et  al., 2011) and Aureobacterium species (− ) γ-lactamase (Agl) 
with 30% sequence identity (PDB code 1HKH) (Line et al., 2004) 
has been carried out. The catalytic triad residues and the posi -
tion of the oxyanion hole are conserved between these enzymes. 
The PcaD and Agl show that the TtEst pocket has a much more 
polar and charged environment in the active site, which allows 
the binding of organic acids such as d-malate where the distant 
carboxyl is coordinated by Arg139 and Tyr105. The PcaD and Agl

enzymes have more hydrophobic substrate binding pockets, with 
the residues Arg139 and Tyr105 in TtEst replaced by Trp135 and 
Ile129 in PcaD and Trp204 and Leu125 in Agl. In both PcaD and 
Agl, the active site is better suited for the binding of structures 
such as lactone and γ-lactam rings. Similarly, the Pseudomonas 
fluorescens esterase with 30% sequence identity (PDB code 3HEA) 
(Yin et al., 2010) has an alcohol pocket where the structure is lined 
with several hydrophobic phenylalanine side chains that should 
have affinity for the lactone ring. This would explain its lactonase 
activity towards caprolactone (Cheeseman et al., 2004) in addition 
to the esterase activity.
Mutant enzymes have been constructed to extend the substrate 
range of T. terrifontis esterase to accept the larger butyrate and 
valerate pNP esters. These mutant enzymes have also shown a sig-
nificant increase in activity towards acetate and propionate pNP 
esters. A crystal structure of the Leu37Ala mutant has been deter-
mined with the butyrate product bound in the carboxyl pocket of 
the active site. The mutant structure shows an expansion of the 
pocket that binds the substrate carboxyl group, which is consistent 
with the observed increase in activity towards pNP-butyrate.
A α-Carbonic Anhydrase from the 
Thermophilic Bacterium Thermovibrio 
ammonificans
Carbonic anhydrase enzymes catalyze the reversible hydration 
of carbon dioxide to bicarbonate. A stable robust α-carbonic 
anhydrase has been identified in the thermophilic bacterium 
Thermovibrio ammonificans. The enzyme has been cloned and 
overexpressed in E. coli. This protein has been characterized both 
biochemically and structurally ( James et  al., 2014). The crystal 
structure of this enzyme has been determined in its native form 
and in two complexes with bound inhibitors. It is unusual since 
it forms a tetrameric structure rather than the dimer reported 
for some previously studied related enzymes. The Thermovibrio  
enzyme is stabilized by a unique core in the center of the molecule 
formed by two intersubunit disulfide bonds and a single lysine 
residue from each monomer ( Figures  3 and 4). The structure 
of this central core region protects the intersubunit disulfide 
bonds from reduction. The enzyme is located in the endoplasmic 
reticulum of Thermovibrio as evidenced by the presence of an 
N-terminal signal peptide. When the recombinant protein is 
oxidized to mimic the natural environment of the periplasmic 
space, it shows an increase in thermostability and retains 90% 
of its activity after incubation at 70°C for 1 h. These properties 
make it a good candidate for commercial carbon dioxide cap -
ture. Another thermophilic bacterial α-carbonic anhydrase has 
been described from Sulfurihydrogenibium yellowstonense. This 
carbonic anhydrase is also thermostable and is a dimer stabilized 
by ionic networks (Di Fiore et al., 2013).
The thermophilic bacteria appear to contain the high-activity 
α-carbonic anhydrase enzymes that have a similar structure to 
the well-studied bovine carbonic anhydrase enzyme, whereas the 
archaea have carbonic anhydrases that have different structures 
and mechanisms. There are six distinct families of CAs ( α, β, γ, 
δ, ζ, and η) (Smith et  al., 1999 ; Guler et  al., 2015). The amino 
acid sequences are conserved between each family; however, 
there is no sequence or structural similarity between the different 
families. The carbonic anhydrase activity requires the presence 
of a catalytic zinc ion which is coordinated to either histidine 
or cysteine amino acids depending on the class of the enzyme 
(Silverman and Lindskog, 1988).

A Thermophilic Transaminase enzyme 
from Sulfolobus solfataricus
The transaminase enzymes are important biocatalysts for the 
pharmaceutical industries since they produce chiral amines 
which are components of a range of different drug molecules. 
The archaeon S. solfataricus has been found to be an interesting 
source of a thermostable transaminase enzyme of the group 
IV Pfam group ( Sayer et  al., 2012 ). This pyridoxal phosphate 
(PLP)-containing enzyme is involved in the non-phosphorylated 
pathway for serine synthesis which is not found in bacteria but is 
found in animals and plants. The Sulfolobus transaminase carries 
out the conversion of l-serine and pyruvate to 3-hydroxypyruvate 
and alanine. It also has activity towards methionine, asparagine, 
glutamine, phenylalanine, histidine, and tryptophan and can be 
used in a cascade reaction with a C–C bond making enzyme, 
transketolase, for the synthesis of optically pure drug intermedi-
ates (Chen et al., 2006).
The dimeric thermophilic archaeal transaminase enzyme 
structure has been solved in the holo form of the enzyme and in 
complex with an inhibitor gabaculine and in a substrate complex 
with phenolpyruvate, the keto product of phenylalanine (Sayer 
et al., 2012). Figure 5 shows a cartoon diagram of the dimeric S. 
solfataricus transaminase with an inhibitor bound to the cofactor 
PLP in the two active sites. The structural studies of this enzyme 
have given some insight into the conformational changes around 
the active site occurring during catalysis and have helped to 
understand the enzyme’s substrate specificity (Sayer et al., 2012). 
How different members of the PLP enzyme family are able to 
accept a variety of substrates is vitally important to understand 
for the use of these enzymes in commercial applications.
The Sulfolobus transaminase is relatively thermostable for 
10 min at 70°C and at pH 6.5. Features of the archaeal enzyme that 
relate to its increased stability when compared with a mesophilic 
related yeast enzyme show that the Sulfolobus enzyme has 21 
salt bridges compared to 10 in the mesophilic enzyme including 
several three to four amino acid networks which offer increased 
stability. There is a C-terminal extension in the Sulfolobus enzyme 
and shorter surface loops which are all general features that are 
found in thermophilic enzymes. The Sulfolobus transaminase 
dimer interface is unusual being hydrophobic in nature with few 
ionic interactions which are generally associated with more ther-
mophilic archaeal enzymes. This Sulfolobus serine transaminase 
is the first example of a thermophilic archaeal serine transami -
nase to be studied structurally and is shown to have properties 
that meet the requirements for the commercial application of the 
enzyme in biocatalysis.
New epoxide Hydrolases from 
extremophilic Metagenomes
An important enzyme activity of interest to the pharmaceutical 
industry is the ability to catalyze the hydrolysis of an oxirane 
(epoxide) ring by addition of a molecule of water to form a vici -
nal diol as a product ( Widersten et al., 2010; Kotik et al., 2012). 
The enzymes that can carry out this reaction are ubiquitously 
expressed in all living organisms and they play an important 
physiological role in the detoxification of reactive xenobiotics 
or endogenous metabolites and in the formation of biologically 
active mediators. The epoxide hydrolases are already used for the 
production of optically pure epoxides and diols which are impor-
tant synthons for the preparation of fine chemicals and drugs, for 
example, the chiral precursors of β-blockers (Kong et al., 2014 ; 
Nestl et al., 2014). The epoxide hydrolase enzymes fall into two 
classes with completely different 3D structures, the α/β hydrolase

fold class and the limonene class (LEH) of which only few have 
been fully characterized. The LEH enzyme active site contains 
three residues (Asp, Arg, and Asp) that have been proposed to act 
in a concerted fashion to activate a water molecule which is able 
to open the epoxide ring without the formation of a covalently 
bound alkyl-enzyme intermediate (Arand et al., 2003; Hopmann 
et al., 2005).
Recently, as part of a thermophilic metagenomic project, two 
new thermostable epoxide hydrolases of the limonene class have 
been discovered. The metagenomes were isolated in Russia and 
China from hot terrestrial environments growing at 46°C and 
55°C and at neutral pH. A bioinformatic approach was used to 
identify the genes coding for these industrially important enzymes 
which have been cloned and overexpressed in E. coli. The resultant 
proteins have been fully characterized as far as their biochemi-
cal properties, specificity, stereoselectivity, and crystal structure 
(Ferrandi et al., 2015a). The structure of the LEH from the Russian 
metagenome is shown in Figure 6. The new LEH enzymes have 
also been further evaluated and used in pilot-scale biotransforma-
tions for industrial applications (Ferrandi et al., 2015b).
DeHALOGeNASe eNZYMeS FROM 
eXTReMOPHiLiC BACTeRiA AND 
ARCHAeA
l-Haloacid Dehalogenase from the 
Thermophilic Archaeon Sulfolobus tokadii
A thermophilic dehalogenase enzyme of industrial interest 
is found in the archaeon Sulfolobus tokadaii.  This l-haloacid 
dehalogenase enzyme has been cloned and overexpressed in E. 
coli and has been characterized biochemically and structurally 
(Rye et al., 2007, 2009). This enzyme has applications for chiral 
halo-carboxylic acid production and bioremediation. Chiral halo-
carboxylic acids are important intermediates in the fine chemical/
pharmaceutical industries. The Sulfolobus dehalogenase enzyme 
has the potential to resolve racemic mixtures of bromocarboxylic 
acids and is able to catalyze the conversion of 2-halo-carboxylic 
acids to the corresponding hydroxyalkanoic acids. It has been 
shown to display activity towards longer chain substrates than 
the bacterial Xanthomonas autotrophicus dehalogenase (Van der 
Ploeg et al., 1991) with activity seen towards 2-chlorobutyric acid 
due to a more accessible active site (Rye et al., 2009). The enzyme 
has a maximum activity at 60°C and a half-life of over an hour at 
70°C. It is stabilized by a salt bridge and hydrophobic interactions 
on the subunit interface, helix capping, a more compact subdo -
main than related enzymes, and shortening of surface loops. 
A related hyperthermophilic Pyrococcus  dehalogenase (29% 
sequence identity) whose structure is available from a structural 
genomics project is a monomeric enzyme stabilized by a disulfide 
bond (Arai et al., 2006).
Dehalogenases from the Marine 
environment
The marine environment has been recognized as a potential 
source of novel enzymes (Trincone, 2011). A novel l-haloalkane 
dehalogenase has been biochemically and structurally character-
ized from the psychrophilic bacterium Psychromonas ingrahamii 
(Novak et  al., 2013a). This organism was originally isolated in 
1991 from Elson Lagoon, Point Barrow Alaska. Original samples 
were collected from the sea ice interface, where temperatures can 
reach −10°C (Breezee et al., 2004 ). The P . ingrahamii is a non-
motile, large, rod-shaped bacterium that can utilize glycerol as 
a sole carbon source. The P . ingrahamii genome has been shown 
to encode numerous genes that synthesize polysaccharides and 
betaine choline. These compounds are thought to aid survival 
of the organism at low temperatures ( Riley et al., 2008). Studies 
into the structural properties of proteins from psychrophilic 
organisms have shown they have enhanced structural flexibility 
at low temperatures (Feller, 2003; Feller and Gerday, 2003). The 
fine balance between activity, stability, and flexibility of proteins 
which control enzyme kinetics has been reviewed by Georlette 
et  al. (2004). When proteins from psychrophiles are compared 
with the equivalent proteins from mesophiles, they show a 
decrease in the number of ionic interactions, decreased number 
of hydrogen bonds, and fewer hydrophobic amino acid residues. 
The l-haloacid dehalogenase from P . ingrahamii has been cloned 
and overexpressed in E. coli. The recombinant protein has been 
biochemically and structurally characterized and compared with 
mesophilic and thermophilic l-haloacid dehalogenases. It shows 
activity towards monobromoacetic (100%), monochloroacetic 
acid (62%), S -chloropropionic acid (42%), S -bromopropionic 
acid (31%), dichloroacetic acid (28%), and 2-chlorobutyric acid 
(10%). The l-haloacid dehalogenase has highest activity towards 
substrates with shorter carbon chain lengths (≤C3), without pref-
erence towards a chlorine or bromine at the α-carbon position.

Extremophilic enzymes and industrial applications
Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www.frontiersin.org
The enzyme has an optimal temperature for activity at 45°C 
and retains 70% of its activity after being incubated at 65°C for 
90 min. The enzyme is relatively stable in organic solvents and 
therefore shows mesophilic properties despite being isolated from 
a psychrophilic bacterium. The relatively high thermal stability 
and optimal temperature for activity is surprising for an enzyme 
isolated from a psychrophilic bacterium. The thermal stability 
results show that the enzyme is stable beyond its catalytic tem -
perature optimum. The “equilibrium model” has previously been 
described to explain the difference between apparent temperature 
optimum and higher thermostability for a range of psychrophilic, 
mesophilic, and thermophilic enzymes ( Lee et  al., 2007 ). This 
model includes an inactivated state of the enzyme at temperatures 
above the optimally active form, which are in reversible equilib -
rium. At sufficiently higher temperatures, the folded but inactive 
form of the enzyme can undergo irreversible thermal inactivation 
to the denatured state (Daniel and Danson, 2010).
Many reported psychrophilic enzymes have highest catalytic 
efficiency at low temperatures and have low thermal stability. 
However, some psychrophilic enzymes have been shown to 
denature at higher temperatures than that they appear to be 
inactive. For example, the Pseudoalteromonas haloplanktis DNA 
ligase is optimally active below 20°C, inactive above 25°C, but is 
not fully denatured until 35°C (Georlette et al., 2003). Also the 
citrate synthase from an Antarctic bacterium has been shown to 
decrease in enzyme activity at temperatures above its temperature 
optimum; however, this is not due to thermal denaturation of the 
enzyme since the activity loss can be reversed as the temperature 
decreases (Gerike et al., 1997, 2001). Further studies on psychro-
philic enzymes will help to understand how these enzymes are 
adapted to function at low temperatures.
An homology model of the marine l-haloacid dehalogenase 
has been built based on the crystal structure of related enzymes. 
The active site pocket of the P . ingrahamii model and the S. tokodaii 
and Burkholderia cepacia enzymes are highly similar, with almost 
all residues in similar conformations. The observed thermostabil-
ity of the enzyme is consistent with the conclusions drawn from 
homology modeling where no obvious psychrophilic adaptations 
were observed. At the in vitro optimal growth temperature of P.  
ingrahamii, l-haloacid dehalogenase would not be active. This 
could indicate that the enzyme has been acquired by horizontal 
gene transfer. This solvent-resistant and stable l-haloacid dehalo-
genase from P . ingrahamii has potential to be used as a biocatalyst 
in industrial processes.
Another novel marine dehalogenase from the 
Rhodobacteraceae family has been isolated from a polychaeta 
worm collected from Tralee beach, Argyll, UK. The enzyme 
tested positive for l-haloacid dehalogenase activity towards 
l-monochloropropionic acid (Novak et  al., 2013b). A diagram 
of the overall two-domain structure is shown in Figure 7 with 
the active site aspartic acid highlighted in the cleft between the 
domains. The active site of this dehalogenase shows significant 
differences from previously studied l-haloacid dehalogenases. 
The asparagine and arginine residues shown to be essential 
for catalytic activity in other l-haloacid dehalogenases are not 
present in this enzyme. The histidine residue that replaces the 
asparagine residue as shown in the structure was coordinated 
by a conformationally strained glutamate residue that replaces 
a conserved glycine residue. The His/Glu dyad is positioned for 
deprotonation of the catalytic water which attacks the ester bond 
in the reaction intermediate. The catalytic water in this novel 
enzyme is shifted by from its position in other l-haloacid dehalo-
genases. A similar His/Glu or Asp dyad is known to activate the 
catalytic water in haloalkane dehalogenases. The novel enzyme 
represents a new member within the l-haloacid dehalogenase 
family and appears to have evolved with properties of a mixture 
of a haloalkane dehalogenase and a haloacid dehalogenase, and 
it has the potential to be used as a commercial biocatalyst. It 
is not unusual to find such novel enzymes in extremophilic 
microorganisms.
The use of psychrophilic enzymes in industrial processes 
allows instability issues with reactants and products to be avoided 
and results in a reduction in cost because of the lower energy 
consumption. High catalytic efficiency at low temperatures makes 
psychrophilic enzymes attractive for use in biocatalytic processes 
(Gomes and Steiner, 2004; Novak and Littlechild, 2013).
CONCLUSiON
Extremophilic enzymes are becoming an important source of new 
industrially robust biocatalysts. The use of nature’s biodiversity 
provides an ever increasing resource of new genomes and metage-
nomes to identify useful activities which can carry out a variety of

chemical biotransformations of commercial interest. The activity 
of the enzymes can be identified by both bioinformatic techniques 
and screening of expression libraries. The enzymes can be cloned 
and overexpressed in easily grown hosts such as E. coli allowing 
access to sufficient quantities of the purified enzymes for detailed 
biochemical and structural characterization. The scale-up of the 
enzyme production required for commercial applications can be 
carried out by using a fungal host system that allows export of the 
proteins into the growth medium for easy downstream process -
ing, if appropriate. The cost of the enzyme biocatalyst must be 
matched to the value of the end product. Higher value optically 
pure pharmaceutical intermediates which are used as building 
blocks for drug intermediates will allow a higher enzyme price 
than enzymes used for the production of bulk chemicals, additives 
for domestic products, food production, or biomass degradation 
processes. The stability of the biocatalyst is also an economic issue 
since if the enzyme is sufficiently robust under the industrial 
conditions it can be used for repeated cycles of the biocatalytic 
process thereby saving money. The use of enzymes isolated from 
extremophilic microorganisms offers the opportunity to access 
enzymes that are stable in a variety of different conditions such 
as high temperatures, low temperatures, high salt concentrations, 
high pressure, extremes of pH, and often a combination of these 
properties, which can make them more suited to the industrial 
environments.
The use of enzymes in “white biotechnology” is expected to 
grow with biobased materials and chemicals from emerging tech-
nologies predicted to rise globally to over 7.4 million metric tons 
in 2018 (Lux Research Analysis, www.luxresearchinc.com). Each 
industrial process is different and the correct biocatalyst needs to 
be identified and optimized for the industrial application. Many 
enzyme families have not realized their potential in this area and 
remain to be discovered. Enzymes that can catalyze reactions with 
non-natural substrates and under non-physiological conditions, 
which are often used in industry, can be found in the extremo-
phile environment. Although the techniques available for enzyme 
engineering have improved recently, the enzyme discovery and 
optimization process is still a limiting factor for the adoption of 
new biobased industrial processes.
