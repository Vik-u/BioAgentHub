Abstract
Background: D-3-aminoisobutyrate, an intermediary product of thymine, is converted to 2-methyl-3-oxopropanoate
using pyruvate as an amino acceptor by D-3-aminoisobutyrate-pyruvate aminotransferase (D-AIB AT; EC 2.6.1.40). A
large amount of D-AIB AT is distributed in the kidney and liver; however, small amounts are found in the brain.
Recently, D-AIB AT was reported to metabolize asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA)in vivo and was suggested
to be an important enzyme for nitric oxide metabolism because ADMA is a competitive inhibitor for nitric oxide
synthase. In this study, we examined the distribution of D-AIB AT in the rat brain further to understand its role.
We measured D-AIB AT mRNA and protein expression using quantitative RT-PCR and Western blotting, and
monitored its distribution using i mmunohistochemical staining.
Results: D-AIB AT was distributed throughout the brain, with high expression in the cortex and hippocampus.
Immunohistochemical staining revealed that D-AIB AT was highly expressed in the retrosplenial cortex and in
hippocampal neurons.
Conclusion: Our results suggest that D-AIB AT is distributed in the examined- just the regions and may play
an important role there.

Background
D-3-aminoisobutyrate-pyruvate aminotransferase (D-AIB
AT, R-3-amino-2-methylpropionate-pyruvate aminotrans-
ferase, EC 2.6.1.40, alanine: glyoxylate aminotransferase 2,
EC 2.6.1.44) is a unique aminotransferase that metabolizes
not L- but the D-isomer of 3-aminoisobutyrate (AIB) as
an amino donor and pyruvate as an amino acceptor to
generate 2-methyl-3-oxopropanoate and alanine. We, as
well as others, have previously purified and characterized
D-AIB AT in the rat liver [1,2], and its gene structure was
determined by Matsui-Lee et al. [3]. The condition result-
ing in high amounts of D-AIB excretion in the urine is
inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion [4], and indi-
viduals with this condition have been reported to lack
D-AIB AT activity [5]. D-AIB is an intermediate product
of thymine, and D-AIB AT is the only enzyme that me-
tabolizes D-AIB (Kakimoto et al. [5,6]). High amounts
of D-AIB AT are distributed in the kidney and liver,
and small amounts have been identified in the brain.
However, no functional reason for D-AIB AT expression
in the central nervous system has been identified [7]. D-
AIB AT is also known to be a dimethylarginine-pyruvate
aminotransferase ([8], see Figure 1), which metabolizes
asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA)in vivo [9]. There-
fore, it appears that D-AIB AT is also an important en-
zyme for nitric oxide metabolism because ADMA is a
competitive inhibitor of the nitric oxide synthase (NOS)
enzyme family [10]. Endothelial (eNOS) and neuronal
(nNOS) play an obligatory role in the regulation of cere-
bral blood flow and cell viability, and in the protection of
nerve cells or fibers against pathogenic factors associated
with Alzheimer’s disease, Huntington’s disease, seizures,
and migraines [11]. Therefore, in this study, we monitored
the mRNA and protein expression of D-AIB AT in the rat
brain.

Methods
Experimental animals
Male Wistar rats (CLEA Japan, Tokyo, Japan), 6– 8 weeks
old, were housed in air-conditioned rooms (temperature,
22 ± 2°C) with a 12-h light– dark cycle. After rats were
anaesthetized with 30 ml of diethyl ether and decapitated,
the brain was removed and tissues used for examination
(frontal cortex, temporal cortex, cerebellum striatum, thal-
amus, hippocampus, midbrain, pons, and olfactory bulb)
were dissected. All experiments were approved by the
Ethics Review Committee for Animal Experimentation of
Ehime University.
RNA extraction and quantitation of D-AIB AT mRNA
expression
We examined ten rat (the ages of rat breakdown was
that 6 weeks old is six, 7 weeks old is two and 8 weeks
old is two) for RT-PCR. RNA was extracted from each
brain region isolated according to the RNeasy Lipid
Tissue Mini kit instructions (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA),
which included DNase treatment (Qiagen). Following as-
sessment of RNA quality and quantity with the NanoDrop
(NanoDrop Technologies, DE, USA), 1μgo ft o t a lR N A
was used for cDNA synthesis with random hexamers
using Moloney murine leukemia virus reverse transcript-
ase (Applied Biosystems, Austin, TX, USA). The expres-
sion of the D-AIB AT gene transcript was quantified by
real-time PCR with the TaqMan Gene Expression Assay
(Applied Biosystems). TaqMan primer-probe sets for D-
AIB AT (agxt2, Rn00582928_m1) and glyceraldehyde-
3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH, Ss03375435_u1),
used as an endogenous control, were purchased from
Applied Biosystems. Quantitative RT-PCR was performed
using the StepOnePlus System (Applied Biosystems).
Changes in D-AIB AT mRNA expression were calculated
after normalization with GAPDH expression. The cDNA
from an arbitrarily selected control rat were used as a
calibrator sample. TheΔΔCT method provided a relative
quantification ratio according to the calibrator, which
allowed statistical comparisons of gene expression among
samples. Values of fold changes in the sample versus the
frontal cortex samples represented averages from tripli-
cate measurements. Statistical calculations were carried
out using the SPSS Statistical Software Package 11.5
(SPSS, Tokyo, Japan). The mRNA expression differences
among brain tissues were analyzed by analysis of variance
with repeated measures followed by the Bonferroni post
hoc test. AP value less than 0.05 was considered statisti-
cally significant.
Western blotting
We examined four rat (all ages of rat is 6 weeks old)
for Western blotting. Brain tissue was homogenized in
lysis buffer containing 8.1 mM Na
2HPO4,2 . 6 8m M

KCl, 1.47 mM KH2PO4, 137 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA,
and 2 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. Homogenates were cen-
trifuged at 16,000 g for 20 min at 4°C. The supernatant
was decanted into a new centrifuge tube. Protein con-
centrations for each brain region were determined
using the BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific K.K., Yokohama, Japan). Protein samples (10μg)
were suspended in Laemmli sample buffer, and sodium
dodecyl sulfate (SDS) polyacrylamide gel electrophor-
esis was performed accordingt os t a n d a r dp r o c e d u r e s .
Total lysates were separated on 1% SDS-polyacrylamide
gels, and were blotted onto polyvinylidene difluoride
membranes (Millipore, Bedford, MA, USA). After block-
ing with Blocking One (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan),
the membranes were incubated with either anti-D-AIB
AT rabbit polyclonal primary antibody (specificity of
antibody show Additional files 1 and 2) generated using
the D-AIB-AT peptide‘SPYTLGLTNVGIYKMEL’ (Japan
Bioserum, Hiroshima, Japan), or anti-GAPDH rabbit pri-
mary antibody (internal control; Abcam, Cambridge, UK)
diluted in 1% (v/v) Tween 20 at room temperature for
3 h. Membranes were treated with anti-rabbit goat
IgG horseradish peroxidase-linked Whole Antibody (GE
Healthcare, Buckinghamshire, UK) diluted in 1% (v/v)
Tween 20 at room temperature for 1 h. Visualization
using ChemiDoc MP (Bio Rad) was used for detection.
Image J (http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/index.html) was used
for Western blot analysis following digitization.
D-AIB AT immunohistochemistry
Wistar rat brains on postnatal day 7, 14, 28, and 56 were
used in this study. Animals were anesthetized by intra-
peritoneal injection of chloral hydrate (10 mg/kg) and
then perfused transcardially with physiological saline,
followed by 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in 100 mM
phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Brains were removed and
post-fixed in the same solution for 12 h at 4°C and em-
bedded in paraffin wax. Frontal sections of rat brains
were cut at 5 μm, dewaxed in xylene, and rehydrated
with a graded series of ethanol solutions. Histochemistry
was performed using the anti-D-AIB AT antibody (this
antibody same as Western) in combination with the
avidin-biotin peroxidase complex (ABC) method using
the VECTASTAIN ABC kit (Vector Labs, Burlingame,
CA, USA). Endogenous peroxidase was blocked in meth-
anolic hydrogen peroxidase at 36°C for 30 min, and non-
specific protein binding was suppressed by incubation
with 1% (w/v) bovine serum albumin at 36°C for 30 min,
followed by rinsing with 0.02 M phosphate-buffered sa-
line (PBS; pH 7.4). Sections were incubated with the anti
D-AIB AT antibody at 4°C overnight. After rinsing with
PBS, the sections were further incubated with the VEC-
TASTAIN ABC reagent at room temperature for 30 min.
Finally, the sections were colorized with PBS containing
0.006% (w/v) 3-3-diaminobenzidine tetrahydrochloride
and 0.003% (v/v) H
2O2 at room temperature for 30 min,
and lightly counterstained with hematoxylin.
Results
D-AIB AT mRNA expression in the rat brain compared
with GAPDH mRNA expression, used as an internal
standard, is shown in Figure 2. D-AIB AT mRNA was
ubiquitously distributed in rat brain tissues. The mRNA
expression in the brain cort ices, striatum and hippo-
campus were relatively high when compared with other
brain regions but there were no significant differences in
expression levels.
D-AIB AT protein levels were measured by Western
blotting (Figure 3). Protein levels of D-AIB AT in various
brain regions were compared with GAPDH. Expression
levels in parts of the midbrain (about five fold), hippo-
campus and olfactory bulb (about three fold) were high
when compared with frontal cortex.
Immunohistochemical studies revealed that hippocam-
pus is clearly stained with rabbit anti D-AIB AT antibody
(Figure 4b, compared with Figure 4a; pre-immune rabbit
serum). In the hippocampus, neurons in the CA1, CA3,
CA4, and dentate gyrus were strongly stained, particu-
larly the cytosolic region. The expression in the cerebral
cortex was weaker in the outer layer (Figure 4c) than
that in deep layers (Figure 4d). Neurons of the brainstem
were also strongly stained (Figure 4e). Compared with
other cortical regions, the retrosplenial cortex was
strongly stained (Figure 4f). The rat which we examined
about each brain tissues is 8 weeks old. During develop-
ment (Figure 5; day 7 to 56 post partum), D-AIB AT
protein was highly expressed in the hippocampus, cortex,
and choroid plexus at all ages.
Discussion
To our knowledge, this is the first report to examine the
distribution of D-AIB AT in the rat brain. D-AIB AT
was distributed in examined- just the regions, with ex-
pression being greatest in deep layers of the cortex,
hippocampus, and brain stem. Immunohistochemistry
revealed that D-AIB AT expression was highest in the
retrosplenial cortex, hippocampus, brain stem, and chor-
oid plexus.
High amounts of D-AIB AT are distributed in the kid-
ney and liver [5], and small amounts are observed in
various regions of the brain [7]. Although the only known
role of D-AIB AT relates to the metabolism of D-AIB, its
precise function in the central nervous system remains
unclear. Recently, D-AIB AT was identified as an enzyme
that not only catalyzes the metabolism of D-AIB but also
catalyzes the degradation of ADMA, which is a competi-
tive inhibitor of NOS [12]. ADMA is present in the central
nervous system [13] and is reported to be ubiquitously

distributed in various regions of the brain [14]. D-AIB AT
inhibits NO productionin vitro [10] and actively degrades
ADMA in vivo [9]; however, ADMA is also degraded by
dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) 1, a
member of the DDAH enzyme family [15]. We hypothesize
that D-AIB AT in the brain effectively metabolizes ADMA
as an ADMA: pyruvate aminotransferase, an amino-
transferase that catalyzes ADMA with pyruvate to form
α-keto- δ-(N
G,NG- dimethyl-guanidino) valeric acid and
alanine in vivo(Figure 1), resulting in a decrease to ADMA
brain levels, which helps NOS improve endothelial NO
production in the brain.

In this study, we report that D-AIB AT is distributed
in the examined- just the regions. Several studies sup-
port the idea that ADMA may be important regulator of
the NO system, where elevated ADMA concentrations
are associated with hypertension [16], congestive heart
failure [17], progression of chronic kidney disease [18]
and atherosclerosis [19]. D-AIB AT may be related to
the vulnerability for cerebro-vascular disease.
Our immunohistochemical studies revealed that D-
AIB AT is widely expressed in the retrosplenial cortex
and hippocampus. The rat retrosplenial cortex is similar
to Brodmann areas 29 and 30 in primates, which has
abundant reciprocal projections with the hippocampus
directly and indirectly [20]. Inactivation of the retrosple-
nial cortex is reported to impair active navigation in
dark testing conditions in a rat model with tetracaine
anesthetization of the retrosplenial cortex, suggesting that
this region is important for spatial memory [21]. Hippo-
campal atrophy is known to be one of the main symptoms
of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), and disruption of fronto-
hippocampal connections, not only directly but indirectly
through damage of the retrosplenial posterior cingulate
cortex, is observed in AD [22]. Metabolic decline in the
retrosplenial cortex is also reported in AD following posi-
tron emission tomography [23,24]. Pathological changes
in this region can also occur in schizophrenia, bipolar
disorder, and post-traumatic stress disorder review [25].
Therefore the expression of D-AIB AT in brain lesions
formed following neurological disease progression.
Conclusion
In conclusion, D-AIB AT is widely distributed in the brain
and may work as an aminotransferase not only related to
degradation of D-AIB from thymine. Further studies will
be needed to clarify the role of D-AIB in the central ner-
vous system.
