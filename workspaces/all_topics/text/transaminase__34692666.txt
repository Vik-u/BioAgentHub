Herein, we report the development of a multi-enzyme cascade using transaminase (TA),
esterase, aldehyde reductase (AHR), and formate dehydrogenase (FDH), using
benzylamine as an amino donor to synthesize the industrially important compound
sitagliptin intermediate. A panel of 16 TAs was screened using ethyl 3-oxo-4-(2,4,5-
triﬂuorophenyl) butanoate as a substrate ( 1). Amongst these enzymes, TA from
Roseomonas deserti (TARO) was found to be the most suitable, showing the highest
activity towards benzylamine (∼70%). The inhibitory effect of benzaldehyde was resolved
by using AHR fromSynechocystis sp. and FDH fromPseudomonas sp., which catalyzed
the conversion of benzaldehyde to benzyl alcohol at the expense of NAD(P)H. Reaction
parameters, such as pH, buffer system, and concentration of amino donor, were
optimized. A single whole-cell system was developed for co-expressing TARO and
esterase, and the promoter engineering strategy was adopted to control the
expression level of each biocatalyst. The whole-cell reactions were performed with
varying substrate concentrations (10 –100 mM), resulting in excellent conversions
(ranging from 72 to 91%) into the desired product. Finally, the applicability of this
cascade was highlighted on Gram scale, indicating production of 70% of the sitagliptin
intermediate with 61% isolated yield. The protocol reported herein may be considered an
alternative to existing methods with respect to the use of cheaper amine donors as well as
improved synthesis of (R) and (S) enantiomers with the use of non-chiral amino donors.

INTRODUCTION
Biocatalysts continue to be explored for consideration as green alternatives to alleviate the
environmental issues encountered with the use of methods pertaining to traditional organic
chemistry (Patil et al., 2018; Pagar et al., 2021). Thus, multi-enzyme cascade reactions have
garnered attention owing to their elegance ( Sperl and Sieber, 2018 ; Hwang and Lee, 2019 ;
Martínez-Montero et al., 2019 ), comprehensiveness, and involvement in the synthesis of a
considerable variety of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and other industrially important
chemicals (Sung et al., 2018; Patil et al., 2019; Yoon et al., 2019).
Sitagliptin is a well-reported example of a drug containing aβ-amino acid moiety as a key
component. Sitagliptin, an inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase-4, is used as an oral antidiabetic drug to

treat type 2 diabetes (Yun et al., 2004; Aschner et al., 2006; Desai,
2011; Villegas-Torres et al., 2015). Merck has described the
industrial manufacturing method of sitagliptin phosphate. In
the ﬁrst-generation process (chemistry route), the chirality of
achiral β-keto ester was introduced in the form of a hydroxy
group in β-hydroxy acid through ruthenium-catalyzed
asymmetric hydrogenation. The hydroxyl group was then
transformed into protected amino acid through several steps,
followed by direct coupling to triazolopiperazine to afford
sitagliptin. The complete process involves eight steps to enable
the production of sitagliptin phosphate with an overall yield of
52% (Hansen et al., 2005; Hansen et al., 2009). In comparison, the
second-generation process comprised a three-step one-pot
synthesis of dehydro-sitagliptin. The synthesis was initiated
with tri ﬂuoro phenylacetic acid, followed by serial and
controlled addition of other reactants and reagents, resulting
in the formation of sitagliptin phosphate. In the last step, the
product was crystallized and separated via simpleﬁltration and
resulted in the obtainment of 82% overall yield (Hsiao et al., 2004;
Xu et al., 2004; Clausen et al., 2006).
The abovementioned chemical process involves the use of
hazardous chemicals and other toxic substances. Biocatalysts are
environmentally friendly and can be used as an alternative for the
chemical process. TA is reportedly a useful and versatile biocatalyst
for the selective and sustainable synthesis of amines, including
ketones and aldehydes (Mathew and Yun, 2012; Park and Shin,
2013; Guo and Berglund, 2017; Slabu et al., 2017; Hauer, 2020). For
the enzymatic synthesis of sitagliptin, theR-selective TA derived
from Arthrobacter sp. was recently engineered using
computational modeling and iterative directed evolution tools.
The evolved enzyme harbors 27 mutations, highlighting it as a
highly active variant, thus enabling its use in the production of the
desired sitagliptin at 92% yield (Savile et al., 2010). Another
enzymatic route considered for the synthesis of a sitagliptin
intermediate using TA (ATA117-rd11 from Arthrobacter sp.)
was reportedly adopted to produce the desired sitagliptin
intermediate at a yield of 82% (Hou et al., 2016). Recently,
Zheng and co-workers have reported the asymmetric synthesis
of sitagliptin intermediate using TA engineered fromArthrobacter
cumminsiiZJUT212 (M1+M122H), which helped obtain the target
product at∼92% yield (Cheng et al., 2020). Recently, we reported
two enzymatic strategies for the synthesis of sitagliptin
intermediate using TA from Ilumatobacter coccineus (TAIC)
and commercialCandida rugosalipase (CRL) in one cascade, as
well as using TAIC and esterase fromPseudomonas stutzeri(Est
PS) in another cascade. In both cascades, (S)-α-methylbenzylamine
((S)-α-MBA) was used as an amine donor, resulting in∼82%
conversion to the desired product (Kim et al., 2019; Khobragade
et al., 2021).
Although these TAs are routinely used for the production of
various industrially important compounds, including sitagliptin,
they present with various inherent problems for large-scale
production, such as inhibition of the biocatalyst by co-products
and unfavorable thermodynamic equilibrium. (Koszelewski et al.,
2010; Park et al., 2013; Voges et al., 2016). Therefore, selection of a
suitable amine donor is a crucial step for efﬁcient TA reactions. As
such, L-alanine (Ala) has been considered as the most widely
utilized amine donor ever since its deaminated product
(i.e., pyruvate) was identiﬁed with the ability of being recycled.
Several enzymes that demonstrate the ability to degrade pyruvate
or to convert pyruvate into Ala have been studied, including lactate
dehydrogenase, pyruvate decarboxylase, acetolactate synthase, and
alanine dehydrogenase, complemented by cofactor recycling using
FDH or glucose dehydrogenase (Shin and Kim, 2001; Hoehne
et al., 2008; Koszelewski et al., 2008; Koszelewski et al., 2008;
Truppo et al., 2009; Truppo et al., 2009; Koszelewski et al., 2010;
Mutti et al., 2011; Schätzle et al., 2011; Mutti et al., 2012; Pressnitz
et al., 2013; Sayer et al., 2014). Moreover, to shift the reaction
equilibrium, a higher amount of Ala was used, and additional
enzymes (auxiliary enzymes) were introduced to remove by-
products and to recycle the cofactor. However, owing to the
high overall cost, this approach is not appealing for industrial
applications. Isopropyl amine (IPA) is considered a promising
amino donor, as many TAs demonstrate the ability to accept IPA
as an efﬁcient amino donor, including A. citreus TA mutant,
ATA117 mutant, and TAs fromP. aeruginosa, P. denitriﬁcans,
and A. terreus(Cassimjee et al., 2010; Savile et al., 2010; Fesko et al.,
2013; Park et al., 2013; Simon et al., 2014; Dawood et al., 2018). The
advantages of IPA include its achiral nature, which enable its
application with either (S)- or (R)-selective TAs, and the easy
elimination of acetone via implementation of physical or chemical
approaches (Keleﬁotis-Stratidakis et al., 2019). However, IPA also
presents with a few limitations, such as the disruption of reactions
for ﬁnal product isolation and puriﬁcation in the presence of excess
amounts of IPA, and the additional assembly required to remove
the deaminated product. Recently,‘smart’a m i n ed o n o r ss u c ha s3 -
amino-cyclohexa-1,5-dienecarboxylic acid, o-xylylene diamine,
cis-but-2-ene-1,4-diol, cis-but-2-ene-1,4-diamine, and cadaverine
have been reported as effective amine donors because they can be
used at equimolar quantities (Wang et al., 2013; Green et al., 2014;
Gomm et al., 2016; Martínez-Montero et al., 2016; Payer et al.,
2017). One of the advantages of these amino donors is the auto-
degrading properties of their co-products. However, the separation
of product and substrate upon reaction completion can be
challenging owing to the similar molecular properties of the
amino donors. Moreover, they are costly compared to Ala and
IPA. Currently, (S)-α-MBA is the most commonly used amine
donor for the synthesis ofβ-amino acids, and the majority of TAs
display high activity towards (S)-α-MBA, but (S)-α-MBA is a
relatively expensive co-substrate for transamination reaction;
furthermore, the deaminated co-product, acetophenone, is
known to inhibit TA (Shon et al., 2014; Mathew et al., 2016).
Nevertheless, in a study investigating the amino donor speciﬁcity of
TA derived fromVibrio ﬂuvialis JS17, the biocatalyst exhibited 3.6
and 30% speciﬁcity for IPA and Ala, respectively, compared with
(S)-α-MBA (100%), and benzylamine showed 1.15-fold higher
activity than (S)-α-MBA (Shin and Kim, 2002)).
However, studies conducted for screening and designing
efﬁcient amine donors for the synthesis of β-amino acids
compared to chiral amines remains limited. Therefore,
exploration of a suitable and cheaper amine donor to shift the
reaction equilibrium towards product formation has emerged as a
key step in the establishment of multi-enzyme cascade reactions.
Benzylamine is considered the cheapest donor among the

abovementioned amino donors. Furthermore, it can be used to
perform screening of both (S)- and (R)-selective TAs. Therefore,
as a continuation to our previously published work (Kim et al.,
2019; Khobragade et al., 2021), the present study was conducted
to investigate the effectiveness of benzylamine as an amino donor
for the synthesis of sitagliptin intermediate by using1 as the
substrate (Figure 1). First, we selected a panel of 16 in-house TAs
and assessed their speci ﬁcity for benzylamine. To shift the
reaction equilibrium towards product formation and to
minimize enzyme inhibition by the action of the deaminated
co-products, the AHR/FDH system was used. In this system,
AHR has been considered to catalyze the conversion of
benzaldehyde into benzyl alcohol at the expense of NAD(P)H
cofactor, and FDH has been considered to supply the depleted
NAD(P)H by recycling the corresponding NAD(P)+ cofactor.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals and Enzymes
Candida rugosa lipase (Catalog No. L1754), Benzylamine (S)-
α-methylbenzylamine [(S)-α-MBA], 2,3,4,6-Tetra-O-acetyl-β-D-
glucopyranosyl isothiocyanate (IPTG), pyridoxal 5′-phosphate
hydrate (PLP), perchloric acid (PCA), dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Sigma-Aldrich
Korea, Seoul, South Korea). Ethyl 3-oxo-4-(2,4,5-triﬂuorophenyl)
butanoate was obtained from CKD BiO Corp, Korea.
Expression of the Enzymes
The genes encoding various TAs, AHR, and FDH were synthesized
by Bionics (Seoul, Korea). Then gene was inserted into IPTG-
inducible pET 24ma vectors (TAs). The AHR and FDH were cloned
pET duet vectors (AHR in MCS I site whereas FDH in MCS II site).
The plasmids were transformed toEscherichia coli(BL21) cells, and
the transformants were grown in 0.5 L LB-containing kanamycin or
ampicillin (50 or 100μg/ml) at 37
°C. The cells were induced with
0.1 mM IPTG when OD600 reached 0.6–0.8 (Kim et al., 2019; Shon
et al., 2014; Mathew et al., 2016.). After the overnight induction at
20°C, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (5,000 rpm, 10 min)
and washed twice with 200 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0).
Determination of Speciﬁc Activity of Est PS
Using Whole Cells
To examine the speciﬁc activity of Est PS, cells were grown in
0.2 L of LB media containing ampicillin (100μg/ml) at 37°C.
When the cell OD600 reached 0.6–0.8, 0.1 mM IPTG was added
(Kim et al., 2019.), followed by overnight incubation at 20°C.
Thereafter, the cells were harvested by centrifugation (4,400× g,
10 min) and were subjected to washing steps two times using
200 mM Tris/HCl buffer (pH 8.0). For the reaction, Est PS
(0.15 mg
DCW/ml) was incubated at 37 °C for 20 min with
DMSO 15% and 500 µl Tris-HCl buffer (200 mM, pH 7.0)
containing ethyl 3-oxo-4-(2,4,5-tri ﬂuorophenyl) butanoate
(10 mM) as a substrate. The reaction was terminated by
adding 1% perchloric acid at a ratio of 1:1 (v/v). Next, the
reaction mixture was centrifuged at 17,000× g for 30 min, and
the clear supernatant was analyzed via high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) using a C 18 symmetry column.
Whole-Cell Biotransformation Reactions of
the Substrate at Different Concentrations
Whole-cell biotransformation reactions were conducted in a
reaction volume (5 ml) containing 1 (10 or 50 mM),
benzylamine (20 or 150 mM), DMSO (5% (v/v), PLP

(0.5 mM), CRL (10 or 50 mg/ml), Tris-HCl buffer (200 mM, pH
8.0), and whole cells expressing TA only or co-expressing TARO-
Est PS. During the reaction, pH was reduced owing to the
hydrolysis of an ester substrate. Therefore, the pH of the
reaction mixture was adjusted manually by adding 5 M NaOH
solution at speci ﬁc intervals during the 5-h reaction.
Subsequently, the sample was collected, and the presence of3
was detected using HPLC.
Construction of Different Variant of T7
Promoter
The promotor engineering strategy is applied to achieve the
optimum expression level of Est PS as described in our
previous study (Khobragade et al., 2021). In brief, the gene
(Est PS) was cloned in the different strengths of T7 promotors
in the pET15b plasmid ( Chizzolini et al., 2014). The newly
constructed different variant of pET15b plasmid and TARO
was co-expressed to develop a single-cell biocatalyst. The
speciﬁc activity and enzymatic reaction of newly developed co-
expressed whole cell was mentioned above.
Whole-Cell Biotransformation Reaction of
the Substrate at Different Concentrations
Using a pH-Stat System
Whole-cell biotransformation reactions were performed in a
reaction volume (30 ml) comprising 1 (100–400 mM),
benzylamine (150–300 mM), DMSO (5% (v/v), PLP (0.5 mM),
Tris-HCl buffer (200 mM, pH 8.0), and cells co-expressing
TARO-Est PS. Similar to the above-mentioned reaction, the
hydrolysis of an ester substrate to its corresponding acid
caused a decrease in pH in this reaction. Therefore, an 877
Titrino Plus pH-stat system (Metrohm AG, Herisau,
Switzerland) for automatic titration with 5 M NaOH was used
to ensure a stable pH. Samples were collected at speciﬁc intervals
for the identiﬁcation of 3 using HPLC.
Analytical Method
The quantitative analysis ofβ-amino acid was performed using
HPLC with a Crownpak CR column (Daicel Co., Japan) at
210 nm, with an elution of perchloric acid solution (pH 1.5;
0.6 ml/min) as previously reported (Kim et al., 2019; Shon et al.,
2014). Theβ-keto ester (1) were analyzed using HPLC with C-18
Column. Mobile phase: 40% water and 60% methanol containing
0.1 TFA. Flowrate: 1.0 ml/min, wavelength: 254 nm.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Screening of TAs for the Synthesis of
Sitagliptin Intermediate fromβ-keto Acid
Generally, (S)-selective TAs with speciﬁcity for Ala as an amine
donor belong to fold-type l (th e aspartate aminotransferase
superfamily). Among these enzymes ( S)-β-TAs reportedly
possess high activity towards β-a n d γ-keto acids as a
substrate, resulting in the corresponding β-a n d γ-amino
acids. These amine compounds are extensively used for the
synthesis of many industrially relevant chiral compounds.
Earlier studies have proven that TA exhibits good reactivity
towards (S)-α-MBA as an amine donor for the transamination
step (Mathew et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2019). For screening of
suitable TA biocatalysts with high speciﬁcity for benzylamine,
we selected a panel of our in-house TAs as described previously
(Kim et al., 2019 ). According to previous studies, TAs
demonstrating speci ﬁcity for β-keto acids also possess good
reactivity to γ-keto acids, enabling the establishment of
improved assay conditions for analysis of γ-amino acids.
Therefore, for the initial s creening of TAs, 4-oxo-4-
phenylbutanoic acid was selected as a substrate, and
benzylamine was used as an amine donor. For convenience,
whole-cell biocatalysts were used in this assay. Brieﬂy, codon-
optimized genes encoding the suitable TAs from 16 desired
sources (Table 1) were synthesized and cloned into pET24ma
vectors and were then expressed usingE. coli BL21 (DE3) host
cells (Table 1). Whole-cell biotransformation was performed
using 10 mM 4-oxo-4-phenylbutanoic acid substrate, 20 mM
benzylamine, 0.5 mM PLP, and 9 mg
CDW/ml cells of each TA
biocatalyst (Figure 2). Among the sixteen enzymes investigated,
TAOI and TAIC exhibited the highest conversion 13 –15%,
whereas eight other TA biocatalysts (TABL, TABU, TARO,
TASM, TAHP, TARB, TAAF, and TAPI) led to the
achievement of modest conversion of 2–7% into the desired
product. On the contrary, the remaining six TAs (TALAB,
TAKK3, TAPC, TABV, TAKI, and TASS) resulted in the
obtainment of a negligible amount of the desired product
(<0.5%). Although few TAs showed comparable activity, the
considerably lower conversion could be attributable to enzyme
inhibition by benzaldehyde, which was generated as a
deaminated co-product of benz ylamine during the reaction.
However, we examined the enzyme inhibition of
benzaldehyde with highly active TAs like TAIC, TARO, and
TAOI. As expected, we observed the inhibition of benzaldehyde
on the enzyme ( Supplementary Figure S1 ). Therefore, we
established an aldehyde removal system to minimize the
inhibition of TA biocatalyst and to shift the reaction
equilibrium towards product formation. Literature reports
have evidenced that AHR demonstrates good activity towards
benzaldehyde and can efﬁciently catalyze its conversion into
benzyl alcohol at the expense of NAD(P)H; thus, we selected
AHR and FDH for recycling of the depleted NAD(P)H cofactor.
With the adoption of such a removal system, the reactions were
performed using 10 mM 4-oxo-4-phenylbutanoic acid, 20 mM
benzylamine, 0.5 mM PLP, and 9 mg
CDW/ml of each TA
biocatalyst and AHR/FDH cells ( Figure 2 ). As expected,
utilization of the benzaldehyde removal system improved
product formation under conditions of TAOI ( ∼30%)
catalysis by 2-fold. Interestingly, product formation via
catalysis by TARO and TAHP was signiﬁcantly enhanced by
∼3- and 6-fold, respectively. In contrast, all other TAs did not
signiﬁcantly elevate product formation, resulting in the
achievement of only <14% yield of the desired product.
These results suggested that benzaldehyde exerted inhibitory
effects against the TAs and should be removed to efﬁciently

benzaldehyde removal succe ssfully improved the overall

optimization of the cascade reaction. Finally, the best six TAs
(TAHP, TARO, TAOI, TAIC, TABL, and TABV) from the panel
were selected for subsequent optimization using coupled
enzyme reaction.
Design and Optimization of Coupled
Enzyme Reaction (Transaminase/Lipase)
for the Synthesis of Sitagliptin Intermediate
From the Correspondingβ-keto Ester
For the synthesis of sitagliptin intermediate using coupled
enzyme reaction, lipase is necessary for hydrolysis of the
ester substrate. Previous studies have reported the efﬁcacy of
CRL for hydrolysis of an ester substrate. Additionally, to
overcome the low intrinsic stability of β-keto acids due to
rapid decarboxylation (Rudat et al., 2012), many biocatalytic
approaches have been developed by designing the
corresponding ester or nitriles as a substrate. Notably, rapid
hydrolysis of an ester substrate will cause pH decrease during
the reaction, which will affect the optimal conditions of the
biocatalysts in the cascade. Therefore, the decreased pH value
should be compensated by adding a suitable concentration of
base (5 M NaOH) at various time intervals. Considering this,
coupled reactions consisting of CRL and six TAs were
performed using 10 mM 1 as a substrate. In these reactions,
TARO was found to be the best TA, presenting with a
conversion of 91%. The other three enzymes exhibited the
achievement of 75–82% conversion into the desired product
(Figure 3A). These results suggested that all selected enzymes
except TABU demonstrated a higher speciﬁcity for β-keto acid
than that for γ-keto acid, and they were therefore selected for
further optimization. Next, the reaction parameters, such as pH

and buffer system, were optimized for reaction with the four
selected TAs (TARO, TAHP, TAOI, and TAIC)
(Supplementary Figure S2). To determine the optimum pH
and suitable buffer species for reaction, three different buffer
systems were inspected, namely acetate (pH 4.0–6.0), phosphate
(pH 6.0–8.0), and Tris-HCl (pH 7.0–10.0). All four TAs showed
the highest activity at pH 8.0 (Tris-HCl buffer); however, for TA
from Vibrio ﬂuvialis JS17, slightly alkaline pH conditions were
necessary, possibly owing to an increase in the effective
concentration of deprotonated amine donor, which enhanced
the external aldimine formation (Guo and Berglund, 2017).
After optimization of the reaction, we compared the speciﬁcity
of these TAs for (S)-α-MBA. For reactions using benzylamine as
an amine donor, the AHR/FDH system was used to remove the
benzaldehyde. However, the system was not adopted in reactions
with (S)-α-MBA used as an amine donor because the removal of
acetophenone did not reportedly improve product formation
(Khobragade et al., 2021). The reactions consisted of 10 mM1,
20 mM benzylamine, 10 mg/ml CRL, 0.5 mM PLP, and 9 mg
CDW/
ml of each biocatalyst. In reactions using benzylamine as an
amine donor, all four TAs led to the obtainment of>80% yield,
with TARO showing the highest conversion of 90%. In contrast,
reactions using (S)-α-MBA led to the achievement of the target
product at only∼70% yield, with TARO exhibiting the highest
conversion of 77% (Figure 3B). The observed 10–15% higher
conversion with benzylamine as an amine donor indicated that
the four selected TAs possessed higher speciﬁcity for benzylamine
than that for ( S)-α-MBA. Encouraged by these results, we
performed further reactions with increased substrate
concentration (50 mM 1) and varying CRL concentrations
(30–60 mg/ml). Among the four enzymes, TAHP
demonstrated the highest conversion of 36% with 40 mg/ml
CRL, whereas the other three enzymes resulted in the
achievement of <26% yield, with TARO displaying the second-
highest conversion (26% at 40 mg/ml of CRL). Therefore, TAOI
and TAIC were eliminated, and TAHP and TARO were selected
for subsequent studies.
In general, the amount of amine donor plays a vital role in
transamination reaction. Increasing the amount of amine donor
in the reaction is a commonly used strategy for shifting reaction
equilibrium towards product formation. However, such a high
amount of amine donor can adversely affect the activity of other
enzyme biocatalysts or TA itself in the cascade (Kim et al., 2019).
Hence, to determine the optimal concentration of amine donor,
reactions were conducted using varying concentrations of
benzylamine with 50 mM 1 and 27 mg
CDW/mL biocatalyst
(Table 2). Benzylamine at a concentration of 150 mM (3-fold
increase in concentration) was found to be optimal for the
reaction, resulting in 38 and 34% conversion into the desired
product (3) by TARO and TAHP, respectively (Table 2, entry 3).
On the contrary, further increases in the amount of benzylamine
(200–300 mM) led to lower product formation ( <30%),
indicating that a concentration of more than 150 mM
benzylamine inhibited the activity of the enzyme biocatalyst in
the cascade. Furthermore, to conﬁrm benzylamine consumption
during the reaction, we determined the amount of benzyl alcohol
produced. The results suggested that equal amount of the product
was formed and amine donor was consumed in the reaction
(Supplementary Figure S3). Ourﬁnding also indicated that the
AHR/FDH system could be used to successfully convert the
benzaldehyde into benzyl alcohol, thereby shifting the reaction
equilibrium towards product formation. Additionally, we
examined the effect of different amino donor systems
(benzylamine, D-alanine, and IPA) on an ( R)-selective TA
from Neosartorya ﬁscheri. The benzylamine amino donor
system provided the highest conversion (18%), whereas the
D-alanine and IPA amino donor systems resulted in negligible
conversion (<0.1%) (Supplementary Table S1). Therefore, the
benzylamine donor system presented with applicability for both
of (R)- and (S)-selective TAs.

Khobragade et al. Multi-Enzymatic Synthesis of Sitagliptin Intermediate
Application of Promoter Engineering
Strategy for the Synthesis of Sitagliptin
Intermediate
Single whole-cell biocatalysts co-expressing multiple enzymes are
advantageous in terms of convenient handling and enhanced mass
transfer efﬁciency (Tufvesson et al., 2014; Iglesias et al., 2017;
Telzerow et al., 2019). In a previous study, we reported that ratio of
esterase to TA should be balanced forﬁne-tuning of the activity
(TAIC-Est PS). Therefore, promotor engineering strategy was
developed and applied to control the expression levels of each
enzyme (Chizzolini et al., 2014; Yoo et al., 2019). The Est PS used in
the study had a speciﬁca c t i v i t yo f3 . 9 6U / m g ,w h i c hw a s>12-fold
higher than that of CRL. In this experiment, we used a similar
strategy by replacing CRL with a biocatalyst co-expressing TARO
and Est PS.
Therefore, genes encoding TARO and Est PS were designed
and cloned to pET24ma and pET15b vectors, respectively.
Whole-cell E. coli strains co-expressing variants of Est PS with
different promoter strengths and TARO were also developed

(Figure 4A). The speciﬁc activity of the cells expressing TARO
and Est PS alone was estimated to be 0.014 U/mg and 3.56 U/mg,
respectively. Similarly, the speciﬁc activity of whole cells co-
expressing TARO-Est PS was measured ( Table 3), and the
results showed that the speci ﬁc activity decreased with
decreasing order of Est PS promotor strength, indicating
reduced expression level of the enzyme; in contrast, the
speciﬁc activity of TARO was enhanced, suggesting that
TARO expression was higher than that of Est PS in the single-
cell system. For Est PS, the highest speciﬁc activity (1.69 U/mg)
was achieved with the A1 system, and the lowest activity (0.44
U/mg) was obtained with the A7 system. On the contrary, for
TARO, the A7 system exhibited the highest activity of 0.034
U/mg and A1 demonstrated the lowest activity of 0.017 U/mg
(Table 3, entry 1–7).
Considering the ﬁndings obtained herein, subsequent
whole-cell reactions were performed to determine the
optimum single-cell system for the synthesis of sitagliptin
intermediate. The reactions were conducted using 50 mM of
1, 150 mM of benzylamine, and 27 mg
CDW/ml of each cell
system (A1-A7) (Figure 4B). The highest yield of 46% of the
desired product 3) was obtained by using the A4 system,
whereas use of the A2, A3, A5, and A7 systems led to the
achievement of moderate conversion of∼27–34%. Conversely,
the A1 system exhibited extremely low product formation
(11%). Therefore, the A4 system was selected for further
optimization.
Furthermore, to improve the reaction productivity, other
reaction parameters, such as co-solvents and the loading
amount of the whole-cell biocatalyst, were optimized
(Supplementary Figure S4 ). Our results suggested that 5%
(v/v) of DMSO and 27 mg
CDW/mL of whole cells were
optimum, resulting in the achievement of ∼44% yield of the
sitagliptin intermediate. In comparison, the same reaction in
the absence of AHR/FDH system led to the achievement of a
signi ﬁcantly lower conversion rate of 10% into the desired
product ( 3)( Figure 5A ), further con ﬁrming that
benzaldehyde inhibited the action of the enzyme
biocatalyst. Next, as a key factor affecting the productivity
of the reaction, pH was optimized by performing the reactions
at a pH range of 7.0 –10 with 200 mM of Tris-HCl buffer,
50 mM of1, and 27 mg
CDW/ml of the biocatalyst. A pH value
of 8.0 was found to be suitable, leading to the highest
conversion rate of 42%, whereas alkaline pH values of 9.0
and 10 resulted in the achievement of only 38 and 34%
conversion rates, respectively.

Khobragade et al. Multi-Enzymatic Synthesis of Sitagliptin Intermediate
Synthesis of Sitagliptin Intermediate Using
the pH-Stat System
As mentioned above, pH plays a crucial role in the reaction, and
the value consistently decreases owing the hydrolysis of ester into
a carboxylic acid group. The pH values of the reactions in earlier
experiments were controlled using 5 M NaOH via manual
addition at an interval of 30 min for 5 h. However, the
hydrolysis reaction catalyzed by esterase occurs more rapidly,
resulting in a rapid decline in pH during the reaction. Therefore,
manual pH adjustment is inefﬁcient. Hence, to minimize pH
ﬂuctuation and to maintain the optimal pH value (8.0), we used a
pH-stat system in the subsequent experiments. The reactions
were performed using three systems (A1, A4, and A6) with
50 mM of 1 in 30 ml of the total reaction volume
(Supplemenatry Figure S5). Sample analysis at various time
points revealed almost complete consumption of the substrate
within 18 h, resulting in the achievement of∼80% yield of the
desired product. The use of such a pH-stat system enhanced
production by almost 50%, indicating that aﬁne-tuned control of
pH is necessary for optimum product formation. The
concentration of benzyl alcohol formed was comparable to the
amount of product obtained (79%), indicating that an equal
amount of amine donor was consumed during the reaction.
On the contrary, A1 and A6 exhibited 36 and 56% yield of the
sitagliptin intermediate, respectively, suggesting that the
promoter engineering strategy enabled ﬁne-tuned control of
the expression level of each biocatalyst, which was beneﬁcial
for improving the reaction productivity (Supplemenatry Figure
S6). Encouraged by these results, we selected the A4 system for
conducting further reactions with elevated substrate
concentrations of 100–200 mM of1. Our ﬁndings showed that
the reaction with 100 mM substrate provided 72% yield of the
sitagliptin intermediate and led to the achievement of nearly
equal amount of benzyl alcohol (∼71%) (Figure 6), whereas
reaction with 200 mM substrate rection produced only 37%
yield of the desired product (Supplementary Figure S7).
Finally, the applicability of this coupled enzyme reaction was
investigated on Gram scale via utilization of the A4 system using
100 mM (1.0 g) of substrate in 40 ml of the reaction volume. This
preparative scale reaction led to the achievement of∼70% yield of
the sitagliptin intermediate (70 mM; 0.7 g) without major
accumulation of reaction intermediates. After successful
completion of the reaction, the sitagliptin intermediate was
isolated and puri ﬁed. First, the reaction mixture containing
∼0.7 g of the desired product was acidiﬁed using 5
°N HCl (pH
2.0) to terminate the reaction, and the enzyme biocatalysts were
precipitated. The reaction mixture was then centrifuged for
15 min to remove the cell mass, and the supernatant was
subsequently neutralized by using 5 M NaOH and was then
extracted with ethyl acetate (2 times) to remove the unreacted
amine donor and other reaction intermediates that are soluble in
organic solvents. Next, the separated aqueous layer was
evaporated to dryness to obtain the crude product mixture,
which was then solubilized into methanol to separate the
buffer salts and other aqueous impurities. Finally, this
methanol solution was concentrated to obtain the desired
product, which was further puriﬁed by recrystallization using
an ethanol:water system, yielding a pure white solid. The solid
was then characterized by using
1H NMR and HPLC (61%
isolated yield).
CONCLUSION
In conclusion, we report benzylamine as an efﬁcient alternative
amine donor for transamination in the synthesis of sitagliptin
intermediate. We performed screening of TAs with high
speciﬁcity for benzylamine and optimized the reaction
parameters such as pH, buffer system, and amine donor
concentration. The inhibition of TAs or lipase by
benzaldehyde was resolved by the application of an AHR/FDH
system, which ef ﬁciently improved product formation. The
promotor engineering strategy was designed and established
for improved control of the expression levels of each
biocatalyst, and a single whole-cell system for TA and esterase
was developed. Whole-cell biotransformation using various
substrate concentrations (10 –100 mM 1) led to the
achievement of excellent conversion rates (72 –91%) to yield
the sitagliptin intermediate. Fine-tuned pH control during the
reaction by using a pH-stat system improved the yield by∼50% at
a substrate concentration of 100 mM. The optimized cascade with
100 mM substrate resulted in the achievement of 61% yield, as
determined by spectroscopic and chromatographic methods. The
protocol developed in this study can be considered an alternative
to existing methods, with the advantages of obtainment of a cheap
amine donor and simultaneous synthesis of ( R) and ( S)
enantiomers with the use of a non-chiral amino donor. This
novel method can be used to synthesize industrially valuable
compounds, such as substitutedβ- andγ-amino acids, from the
