Abstract 
Background While representing a model bacterium and one of the most used chassis in biomanufacturing, perfor-
mance of Escherichia coli is often limited by severe stresses. A super-robust E. coli chassis that could efficiently tolerant 
multiple severe stresses is thus highly desirable. Sterols represent a featured composition that distinguishes eukary-
otes from bacteria and all archaea, and play a critical role in maintaining the membrane integrity of eukaryotes. All 
sterols found in nature are directly synthesized from (S)-2,3-oxidosqualene. However, in E. coli, (S)-2,3-oxidosqualene 
is not present.
Results In this study, we sought to introduce (S)-2,3-oxidosqualene into E. coli. By mining and recruiting heter-
ologous enzymes and activation of endogenous pathway, the ability of E. coli to synthesize (S)-2,3-oxidosqualene 
was demonstrated. Further analysis revealed that this non-native chemical confers E. coli with a robust and stable cell 
membrane, consistent with a figurative analogy of wearing an “Iron Man’s armor”-like suit. The obtained Iron Man E. 
coli (IME) exhibited improved tolerance to multiple severe stresses, including high temperature, low pH, high salt, 
high sugar and reactive oxygen species (ROS). In particular, the IME strain shifted its optimal growth temperature 
from 37 °C to 42–45 °C, which represents the most heat-resistant E. coli to the best of our knowledge. Intriguingly, 
this non-native chemical also improved E. coli tolerance to a variety of toxic feedstocks, inhibitory products, as well 
as elevated synthetic capacities of inhibitory chemicals (e.g., 3-hydroxypropionate and fatty acids) due to improved 
products tolerance. More importantly, the IME strain was effectively inhibited by the most commonly used antibiotics 
and showed no undesirable drug resistance.
Conclusions Introduction of the non-native (S)-2,3-oxidosqualene membrane lipid enabled E. coli to improve toler-
ance to various stresses. This study demonstrated the effectiveness of introducing eukaryotes-featured compound 
into bacteria for enhancing overall tolerance and chemical production.

Introduction
Developing microbial cell factories for the efficient syn -
thesis of chemicals and fuels provides a green, safe and 
renewable alternative route to traditional petroleum-
based techniques. Various microbes have been geneti -
cally manufactured for synthesis of a variety of bulk 
chemicals, fine chemicals, nature products, biofuels and 
polymers [1]. Among these microbes, Escherichia coli has 
become one of the most used chassis cells in biomanu -
facturing field owing to its specific advantages, including 
fast growth, genetic tractability, easy culture, well charac-
terized metabolic background and availability of genetic 
engineering tools [2]. As such, E. coli has been success -
fully engineered for production of a series of industri -
ally relevant chemicals, including 1,3-propanediol [3],1,4 
butandiol [4], isobutanol [5], L-alanine [6], succinate [7] 
and so on.
However, performances of E. coli strains are often lim -
ited by severe stresses [8–12]. For instance, cultivation of 
E. coli with high growth rate frequently generates a large 
amount of biological heat, which makes the growth of E. 
coli ceased at a high temperature (e.g., 45 °C) [13]. Using 
E. coli to produce organic acids often causes the products 
accumulation with reducing the pH, and E. coli cells were 
rapidly killed under a moderate acidic condition (e.g., pH 
4.2) [11]. For maintaining the optimal pH for continued 
product formation, a base often has to be added, which 
causes the accumulation of cations (e.g.,  Na+ or  K+) [14]. 
While even though low concentration of cations (e.g., 
400  mM  Na+) decreased the specific growth rate of E. 
coli by more than 45% [14]. Cultivation with a high ini -
tial sugar concentration is highly desired in batch fer -
mentation for minimizing sugar feeding. However, high 
sugar concentration often leads to high osmotic pres -
sure, which impairs both the growth and product synthe-
sis of E. coli. When cultivated in a high glucose medium 
(120 g/L), the cell mass and succinate titer of E. coli Suc-
T110 strain decreased by 37% and 30%, respectively [15]. 
In addition, E. coli often encounters reactive oxygen 
species (ROS) sourced from either endogenous metabo -
lisms or environments, thus causing oxidative stress and 
severely inhibiting growth [16].
Therefore, developing robust E. coli strains to resist 
these severe stresses becomes indispensable. However, 
current engineering strategies heavily rely on exploitation 
of the potential of E. coli alone [17–19]. Not surprisingly, 
few successes have been achieved from such engineer -
ing strategies, as it is unreasonable to deal with different 
stress factors by exploiting E. coli alone. Furthermore, 
these engineering strategies frequently take effect to only 
one certain stress rather than multiple stresses encoun -
tered by E. coli during the real production process 
[20–22].
Fortunately, over the course of evolution, organisms 
with distinct advantageous structures have survived in 
environments [23, 24], which provide us gold mine for 
mining robust cellular structures and applying them to E. 
coli for constructing a super-robust E. coli chassis, which 
is expected to outcompete the strategy that solely patches 
its structures. Among the four basic compositions of 
cells including carbohydrates, nucleic acids, proteins and 
lipids, lipids are often the easily ignored molecules of the 
microbial sciences [25]. Actually, lipids have great poten -
tials for serving as robust cellular structures as it is lipids 
(e.g., phospholipids, glycolipid and cholesterol) that con -
sist of the fundamental structure of cells [26].
Sterols are the third lipid class, and also represent a 
featured lipids that distinguishes eukaryotes from bac -
teria and archaea [27, 28]. Sterols play a critical role in 
maintaining the membrane integrity of eukaryotes, 
and have been deemed as membrane reinforcers [29]. 
In particular, cholesterol is the major sterol of animals, 
ergosterol plays a key role in yeast and fungi, and plants 
usually possess more complex sterol compositions such 
as stigmasterol and sitosterol [29] (Fig.  1). Sterols found 
in nature are all directly synthesized from (S)-2,3-oxidos -
qualene [28] (Fig.  1). However, in E. coli, the key chemi -
cal (S)-2,3-oxidosqualene is not present. In this study, we 
sought to introduce this non-native chemical into the 
E. coli. We show that this lipid conferred E. coli with a 
robust and stable cell membrane. Given the role of the 
plasma membrane in defining cellular border, maintain -
ing cellular shape, and protecting cellular integrity [30], 
this remodeling strategy can be compared to wearing an 
“Iron Man’s armor-like” suit for E. coli chassis. Consistent 
with this analogy, the engineered strain showed an effec -
tive increase in the tolerance to multiple adverse stresses, 
and improved tolerance to a variety of toxic feedstocks, 
inhibitory products, as well as elevated synthetic capaci -
ties of numerous valuable chemicals.
Results
Introduction and optimization of (S)‑2,3‑oxidosqualene 
biosynthesis pathway in E. coli
We first sought to design the (S)-2,3-oxidosqualene bio -
synthetic pathway in E. coli. In this design, the native 
methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway converts car-
bon sources into dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) 
and isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP). Then, farnesyl 
diphosphate synthase (IspA) catalyzes the condensa -
tion reaction between DMAPP and IPP to form farnesyl 
pyrophosphate (FPP , C15). Two FPPs will be subse -
quently condensed by squalene synthase (SQS) to form 
squalene (C30), and then catalyzed by squalene monoox -
ygenase (SMO) to yield (S)-2,3-oxidosqualene. However, 
in E. coli, key enzymes SQS and SMO are absent.

Sun et al. Biotechnology for Biofuels and Bioproducts          (2023) 16:191 
 
We then mined SQS and SMO enzymes, and candi -
dates from the representative eukaryote Saccharomy -
ces cerevisiae were first considered. In S. cerevisiae, the 
genes erg9 and erg1 encode SQS and SMO enzymes, 
respectively. ERG9 has been reported to anchor its 
C-terminal domain to plasma membrane and exposes 
its catalytic domain to the cytoplasm [31]. To further 
improve its solubility in E. coli, we decided to remove 
the membrane-anchored domain of ERG9, and this 
truncation enabled the truncated ERG9 (tERG9) exhib -
its a relatively high solubility in E. coli BL21 (DE3) 
(Additional file 1 : Figure S1).
For SMO, although many canonical protein solubil -
ity optimization efforts have been made here, includ -
ing lowering induction temperature and varying IPTG 
inducer concentrations [32], the solubility of ERG1 in 
E. coli still remains a challenge. We thus have to turn 
to mine other SMO candidates. Of numerous enzymes 
identified from Metacyc and Brenda databases, we 
selected the SMO from Methylococcus capsulatus as it 
was the first reported prokaryotic squalene monooxy -
genase [33], sharing a 22% primary sequence identity 
with ERG1 (Additional file  1: Figure S2). Distinct from 
ERG1, here we observed that  SMOMc displayed a better 
solubility in E. coli (Additional file  1: Figure S1), which 
might be owing to the similar intracellular environment 
shared by E. coli and M. capsulatus for protein folding.
After mining enzyme candidates for (S)-2,3-oxidos -
qualene synthesis, we next sought to introduce the two 
key genes into E. coli K-12 MG1655 (Fig.  2a). As plas -
mid overexpression often causes obvious burdens to 
host cells, as well as additional and expensive inducers 
(e.g., IPTG, cumate) have to be added for turning on 
gene’s expression [34], we thus sought to integrate these 
required genes into the chromosome DNA of E. coli, 
to express these genes in a plasmid- and inducer-free 
manner. To do this, a previously developed constitutive 
M1–93 promoter [35] was placed in front of terg9, and 
the constructed M1–93-terg9 expression cassette was 
inserted into the genome of MG1655 at mgsA  site, fol -
lowed by insertion of M1–93-smo Mc expression cassette 
at pta site (Fig. 2b).
However, the presence of (S )-2,3-oxidosqualene and 
other sterols were not detected from the extracted 
membrane fraction of the engineered SOS1 strain 
(MG1655 mgsA::M1–93-terg9, pta::M1–93-smo Mc). 
The MEP pathway converts various carbon sources 
into DMAPP and IPP precursors, while this pathway 
is tightly regulated in E. coli [ 36]. We speculated that 
further activation of MEP pathway will contribute to 
Fig. 1 (S)-2,3-oxidosqualene serves as the common precursor of synthesis of all types of sterols. Multiple arrows represent more than one reaction 
step; squalene hopene cyclase: SHC; tetrahymanol synthase: THS. lanosterol synthases: LSS; cyloartenol synthases: CAS; cucurbitadienol synthases:

the (S )-2,3-oxidosqualene biosynthesis. To do this, we 
up-regulated the expression level of the key isopentenyl 
diphosphate isomerase (Idi) as it has been reported to 
be the rate-limiting step of MEP pathway. In particular, 
the native promoter of idi  was replaced with a strong-
strength constitutive promoter M1–46 [36]. Finally, 
we obtained the engineered E. coli strain (MG1655 
mgsA::M1–93-terg9, pta::M1–93-smo Mc, M1–46-idi ). 
Analogous manipulations were performed to yield 
the control strain (MG1655 ΔmgsA , Δpta, M1–46-idi ) 
(Fig.  2b). Presence of (S )-2,3-oxidosqualene was suc -
cessfully detected from the extracted membrane frac -
tion of the engineered strain but not the control strain 
through gas chromatography analysis (Fig.  2c). The 
identity of formed (S )-2,3-oxidosqualene was further 
confirmed using the mass spectrometry (m/z = 426) 
(Additional file  1: Figure S3). Further quantitative 
analysis revealed the content of the (S )-2,3-oxidos -
qualene in the engineered E. coli strain was ~ 149 μg/g 
dry cell weight (DCW). Presence of other sterols, e.g.,

lanosterol, cholesterol and ergosterol, was not detected 
from the engineered strain.
Non‑native (S)‑2,3‑oxidosqualene greatly alters membrane 
properties of E. coli
As (S)-2,3-oxidosqualene can intercalate into phospho -
lipid bilayers and modulate cell membrane properties of 
eukaryotic cells, we wondered whether (S)-2,3-oxidos -
qualene can also alter the cell membrane properties of 
the engineered strain. Prior studies revealed that mem -
brane leakage was a primary damage issue when micro -
organisms were challenged with stresses [37–39]. We 
thus first evaluated the membrane leakage in the control 
and engineered strains under stresses. To do this, a rep -
resentative membrane-damaging chemical  H2O2 [40] was 
employed and added. Besides, the SYTOX Green nucleic 
acid stain [37] was also added to identify cells with leaked 
cell membrane [37].
Our results showed that in the absence of  H2O2, the 
control and engineered strains showed no difference 
in membrane leakage, with SYTOX permeability val -
ues being approximately 2.60 ×  105 (Fig.  2d). During 
challenge with 5  mM  H2O2, the SYTOX permeability 
value for the control strain greatly increased by 70% to 
4.45 ± 0.19 ×  105. However, under the same condition, 
the SYTOX permeability value for the engineered strain 
only slightly increased by 30% to 3.42 ± 0.06 ×  105. There 
results demonstrated that, (S)-2,3-oxidosqualene did 
lead to a significant decrease in cell membrane leakage of 
engineered E. coli strain when challenged with stresses.
Besides cell membrane, we also investigated the intra -
cellular ATP content after introducing (S)-2,3-oxi -
dosqualene into E. coli, as ATP is the versatile energy 
compound that provides power to drive many fitness 
maintaining processes in living cells [41]. During chal -
lenge with 5  mM  H2O2, we observed that the average 
ATP content of the engineered strain was 32.1 ± 2.0 μmol/
mg DCW, which was 70% higher than that (P = 0.001) of 
the control (18.9 ± 3.8 μmol/mg DCW) (Fig.  2e). In sum-
mary, we believe that both the decrease in cell membrane 
leakage and the increase in intracellular ATP content 
could contribute to the improved robustness of engi -
neered strain, consistent with a figurative analogy of 
wearing an “Iron Man’s armor”-like suit for E. coli strain. 
We thus termed the engineered strain Iron Man E. coli 
(IME) (Fig. 2f).
The IME strain significantly increased tolerance to adverse 
environmental stresses
We next assessed phenotypes of the IME strain with 
(S)-2,3-oxidosqualene. Under cultivation at 37  °C 
in MOPS + 2% (wt/v) glucose minimal medium, the 
IME strain showed a slight growth decline compared 
with the control strain, with its specific growth rate 
(μ, 0.333   h−1) being comparable to the control strain 
(0.341  h−1, P > 0.05) (Fig. 3a). The similar trend was also 
observed when the strains were cultivated at a lower tem-
perature 30  °C (Fig.  3b). We speculated that this slight 
growth decline might be due to the higher protein bur -
den for overexpression of Idi of MEP pathway and het -
erologous SMO and SQS enzymes (Additional file  1: 
Figure S4). Intriguingly, upon cultivation at 42  °C, IME 
strain showed a threefold increase in its μ (0.376   h−1) 
as compared to the control strain (0.091   h−1, P = 0.01) 
(Fig.  3c). Under cultivation at a much higher tempera -
ture of 45  °C, the control strain cannot grow up, which 
is consistent with the lethal temperature levels of E. coli 
reported in previous studies [42] (Fig.  3d). Intriguingly, 
the IME strain grew rapidly under 45 °C, with its μ reach-
ing 0.378   h−1 (Fig.  3d). It seems that the introduction of 
(S)-2,3-oxidosqualene enables the IME strain to shift its 
optimal growth temperature from 37 °C to 42–45 °C. We 
further assessed the survival capacities of E. coli strains 
after heat shock under an extreme high temperature con-
dition (e.g., 55  °C). In particular, the control strain can -
not survive under 55 °C treatment for as short as 30 min, 
while the IME strain can still survive under 55 °C treat -
ment even for 60 min (Fig.  3e). To the best of our knowl-
edge, this represents the most heat-resistant E. coli strain 
[13, 43, 44].
We next assessed acid-resistant phenotype of the IME 
strain. Under cultivation pH at 5.5 in MOPS + 2% (wt/v) 
glucose minimal medium, IME strain showed a slight 
growth decline compared with the control strain (Fig. 3f). 
We deemed this might result from the fact that pH at 5.5 
merely represents a moderate acidic condition and will 
not greatly impair the fitness of E. coli. Therefore, we 
further decreased the cultivation pH to 4.5, to create an 
extreme acidic condition. Intriguingly, the engineered 
strain showed a better growth under this condition, with 
its cell mass (OD 550 ~ 1.0) improving by 67% as compared 
to the control strain (OD 550 ~ 0.6, P = 0.01) (Fig. 3g). We 
further assessed the survival capacities of E. coli strains 
after extreme acidic shock. In particular, under treatment 
at pH 2.0 for 1 h, the survival capacity of IME strain dis -
played at least tenfold higher than that of control strain 
(Fig.  3h), which further confirmed the increased acid-
resistant phenotype of the IME strain.
We further evaluated the tolerance of IME strain to 
other adverse cultivation stresses, including high salt, 
high sugar and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Fig.  3j-
–l). Specifically, under a high salt condition with 600 mM 
NaCl (~ 34.8 g/L), growth of the control strain was greatly 
inhibited and its biomass only reached  OD550 ~ 0.36 in 
16  h, while  OD550 of IME strain reached by 2.3-fold to 
0.82 in the same time (Fig.  3j). Moreover, under a high 
Page 6 of 14Sun et al. Biotechnology for Biofuels and Bioproducts          (2023) 16:191 
sugar condition with 556 mM glucose (~ 100 g/L), the μ 
of IME strain reached up to 0.303   h−1, which increases 
by 19% than that of the control strain (0.254  h−1, P < 0.05) 
(Fig. 3k). For ROS, in the presence of 5 mM  H2O2, the μ 
of the IME strain (0.312   h−1) increased by 60% over the 
control strain (0.194  h−1) (P = 0.03) (Fig. 3l). These results 
demonstrated that the IME strain did improve tolerance 
to multiple adverse environmental conditions.
The IME strain improves tolerance to inhibitors 
in lignocellulose‑derived feedstocks
Lignocellulose-derived feedstocks are a class of impor -
tant renewable resource for biomanufacturing [45]. 
However, inhibitors existing in hydrolysate of lignocel -
lulose impair fitness of microbes [46]. There are three 
main classes of inhibitors in dilute acid-treated ligno -
cellulose feedstock: furans, weak carboxylic acids and 
phenolic monomers [47]. For cost-effective utilization 
of lignocellulosic biomass, construction of these inhib -
itors-resistant strains is needed. Here, we observed that 
IME strain improved tolerance to most of these inhibi -
tors (Fig.  4). Most dramatically, IME strain had a 92% 
increase in its specific growth rate (0.255   h−1) relative to 
the control strain (0.133   h−1) in the presence of 24 mM 
hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) (~ 3  g/L) (Fig.  4a). For 
weak carboxylic acids, IME strain displayed a 25% higher 
specific growth rate (0.331   h−1) relative to the control 
strain (0.264  h−1) during challenge with 24 mM levulinic 
acid (7.5  g/L) (Fig.  4b). For phenolic monomers, IME 
strain showed a 50.4% increase in specific growth rate 
(0.108  h−1) relative to the control strain (0.163   h−1) when 
challenged with 24 mM vanillic acid (2.5 g/L) (Fig. 4c).
Considering that IME improved tolerance to toxic 
feedstocks, we thus wondered whether it can be applied 
for utilization of toxic feedstocks. To this end, we 
selected utilization of lignocellulose hydrolysate as a 
Fig. 3 Synthesis of (S)-2,3-oxidosqualene in E. coli strain and resistance to adverse environmental stresses. a–d IME strain had improved 
thermotolerance, shifted its optimal growth temperature from 37 °C to 42–45 °C. e IME strain had improved tolerance to heat shock. f–h IME strain 
showed acid-resistant phenotype. i, no challenge. j–l IME strain showed improved tolerance to other adverse environmental stresses such as high 
salt condition, high sugar condition and ROS  (H2O2). Error bars indicate standard deviation of at least three biological replicates

demonstration. Specifically, we simulated the exist -
ence of main classes of inhibitors and added three rep -
resentative inhibitors, namely, HMF, levulinic acid, and 
vanillic acid to MOPS + 2% (wt/v) glucose minimal salts 
medium at final concentrations of 16 mM (2 g/L), 43 mM 
(5 g/L) and 6 mM (0.5 g/L), respectively. When cultured 
in this mimic of lignocellulose hydrolysate, the control 
strain cannot grow up any more, with zero glucose uti -
lization. In contrast, IME strain showed a rapid growth, 
with biomass reaching  OD550 at ~ 3.0 and consuming up 
to ~ 10 g/L of glucose in only 24 h (Fig.  4d). To the best 
of our knowledge, this represents the fastest growth rate 
and highest glucose consumption among all E. coli strains 
under representative inhibitors in hydrolysate of lignocel-
lulose in minimal medium [48–51].
The IME strain improves tolerance and production 
of inhibitory products
Among a variety of interesting products, organic acids 
have received increasing attentions due to not only their 
growing utilization in food, lubricant, preservative and 
fuel industries, but also great potential as platform chem-
icals for synthesis of various biodegradable polymers 
[52]. However, as with other biorenewable chemicals, 
high amount of organic acids compromises both the 
growth and performance of microbial factories [53]. 
Here, we continued to evaluate performance of IME 
strain to resisting organic acids.
Lactic acid is a representative organic acid which con -
tains both carboxylic acid group and hydroxyl group, and 
can serve as an important food additive in food industry, 
as well as precursor for manufacturing biodegradable 
and eco-friendly polylactic acid (PLA) polymers [54]. 
During challenge with 500  mM lactic acid (~ 45  g/L), μ 
of IME strain (0.213   h−1) increased by 33% over the con -
trol strain (0.161   h−1, P = 0.0075) (Fig.  5a). Adipic acid 
has been used as a food ingredient as a flavorant and gel -
ling aid, as well as monomer for production of nylon by a 
polycondensation reaction with hexamethylene diamine 
[37]. In the presence of 200 mM adipic acid (~ 29.2 g/L), 
μ of IME strain (0.247   h−1) increased by more than 50% 
over the control strain (0.164  h−1, P = 0.008) (Fig. 5a). Cit-
ric acid is a tricarboxylic acid and used in flavor foods, 
beverages, insecticides and disinfectants. IME showed 
a roughly 15% increase (P = 0.003) in μ relative to the 
control strain when challenged with 200 mM citric acid 
Fig. 4 IME improved tolerance to inhibitors in lignocellulose-derived feedstocks. a–c IME had improved tolerance to inhibitors existing 
in the hydrolysate of lignocellulose (HMF, levulinic acid and vanillic acid). Growth curves were recorded in MOPS + 2% glucose medium 
with different inhibitors in a clear bottom 96-well plate at 37 °C, pH 7.0. d IME showed increased cell mass and glucose consumption with addition 
of representative inhibitors existing in the hydrolysate of lignocellulose. Both control and IME strains were cultivated in MOPS + 2% (w/v) 
glucose mineral salt medium containing 16 mM HMF (2 g/L), 43 mM levulinic acid (5 g/L), and 6 mM vanillic acid (0.5 g/L) in shake flasks at 37 °C 
and an initial pH of 7.0. Error bars indicate standard deviation of at least three biological replicates. HMF, hydroxymethylfurfural

(~ 38.4 g/L) (Fig.  5a). 3-Hydroxypropionate (3-HP) is an 
important platform chemical, ranked in the list of top 12 
value added chemicals from biomass by US Department 
of Energy (DOE) [55]. During challenge with 110  mM 
3-HP (~ 10 g/L), μ of IME strain (0.242   h−1) increased by 
19% over the control strain (0.203  h−1, P = 0.001) (Fig. 5b). 
Moreover, fatty acids are attractive biorenewable chemi -
cals and serve as precursors for synthesis of numerous 
molecules such as alkanes, methyl ketones and fatty alco -
hols. However, fatty acids are inhibitory to the biocatalyst 
[56]. Here, we found that IME effectively enhanced toler -
ance to fatty acids: in the presence of 15 mM (~ 2.2 g/L) 
octanoic acid, μ of IME strain (0.233   h−1) increased 
by ~ 150% over the control strain (0.094   h−1, P < 0.001) 
(Fig. 5c).
Next, we continued to evaluate whether IME improves 
synthesis of organic acids due to improved tolerance, and 
first applied it to 3-HP bioproduction. For construction 
of 3-HP biosynthetic pathway, the glycerol dehydratase 
gene dhaB from Klebsiella pneumoniae [57] and alde -
hyde dehydrogenase gene aldH from Ralstonia eutropha 
[57] were recruited and cloned into pTrc99a empty plas -
mid (Fig.  5b). The resulting plasmid pTrc99a-dhaB-aldH 
was subsequently transformed into both control and 
IME strains. When cultured in MOPS medium with 
2% (wt/v) glycerol under shake-flasks, IME strain with 
Fig. 5 IME improved tolerance to inhibitory organic acids and production of organic acids. a IME had improved tolerance to organic acids. Growth 
curves were recorded in MOPS + 2% glucose medium with different inhibitors in a clear bottom 96-well plate at 37 °C with an initial pH 7.0. Error 
bars indicate standard deviation of at least three biological replicates. b IME had improved tolerance to 3-HP and increased 3-HP production. Both 
control and IME strains with pTrc99a-dhaB-aldH plasmid were cultivated in MOPS + 2% (w/v) glycerol medium in shake flasks at 37 °C, initial pH 
7.0 for 48 h. c IME showed improved tolerance to octanoic acid and increased fatty acids production. Both strains with pXZ18Z plasmid harboring 
the genes encoding RcTE and E. coli 3-hydroxy-acyl-ACP dehydratase (FabZ) were cultivated in MOPS + 2% (w/v) glucose medium in shake flasks 
at 30 °C, initial pH 7.0 for 48 h. Error bars indicate standard deviation of at least three biological replicates. 3-HPA, 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde; 3-HP ,

pTrc99a-dhaB-aldH produced 1057 ± 26  mg/L of 3-HP 
in 48  h, which is ~ twofold higher than the titer from 
the control strain with the same plasmid (362 ± 3 mg/L) 
(P = 0.007) (Fig.  5b). Besides 3-HP , we also applied IME 
strain to bioproduction of fatty acids. Specifically, a plas -
mid pXZ18Z harboring Ricinus communis  thioesterase 
was employed [58, 59]. When characterized in MOPS 
medium supplemented with 2% (wt/v) glucose, IME 
strain with pXZ18Z plasmid produced approximately 
884 ± 278  mg/L of fatty acids in 48  h (Fig.  5c), which is 
128% higher than the corresponding control strain 
(387 ± 61 mg/L) (P < 0.001).
The IME strain can be efficiently inhibited by the commonly 
used antibiotics
Although the IME strain exhibits improved tolerance 
to adverse environmental conditions and industrially 
relevant chemicals, its uncontrolled use may pose the 
potential risk of developing undesirable drug resistance. 
Antibiotics are the most powerful weapons for killing 
bacteria, and can be classified into distinct types accord -
ing to their inhibition mechanisms [60] (Additional file 1: 
Figure S5). The IME strain showed no growth difference 
as compared with the control strain in the absence of 
antibiotics (Fig. 6a).
We first tested the sensitivity of the IME strain to ribo -
some inhibitors, as protein synthesis represents one of 
the major inhibition targets for antibiotics. Chloram -
phenicol is a broad-spectrum antibiotic that binds to 
the 50S subunit of bacterial ribosomes and, thus, inter -
feres with the bacterial protein synthesis [61]. In the 
presence of 5  mg/L chloramphenicol, the control strain 
showed the highest  OD550 value of 1.0 in 16  h. How -
ever, the IME strain grew extremely slow and its  OD550 
value reached only 0.2 in 16 h (Fig.  6b). Erythromycin is 
another 50S ribosome inhibitor. When cultivated in the 
presence of 50  mg/L erythromycin, the μ of IME strain 
(0.156  h−1) decreased by 67% as compared to that of the 
control strain (0.261   h−1, P < 0.01) (Fig. 6c). Besides 50S 
ribosome inhibitors, we further evaluated the sensitivity 
of IME strain to 30S ribosome inhibitors. When exposed 
to spectinomycin (10  mg/L), tetracycline (1  mg/L), and 
streptomycin (0.4  mg/L), the IME strain showed a 62%, 
30%, and 64% lower μ than the control strain, respectively 
Fig. 6 Sensitivity of the IME strain to various antibiotics. a IME and control strains showed no growth differences in the absence of antibiotics. 
The IME strain had increased sensitivity to b chloramphenicol; c erythromycin; d spectinomycin; e tetracycline; f streptomycin; g rifamycin; h 
sulfadiazine; i combination of sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) and trimethoprim (TMP); j polymyxin B; k carbenicillin; l meropenem. Growth curves were 
recorded in MOPS + 2% glucose medium with different antibiotics in a clear bottom 96-well plate at 37 °C, initial pH 7.0. Error bars indicate standard 
deviation of at least three biological replicates
Page 10 of 14Sun et al. Biotechnology for Biofuels and Bioproducts          (2023) 16:191 
(Fig.  6d-–f). These results demonstrate that the IME 
strain showed an obvious increase in its sensitivity to 
protein synthesis inhibitors.
We also assessed sensitivity of the IME strain to other 
types of antibiotics. Rifamycin is the most clinically 
important and extensively studied class of antibiotics that 
inhibits bacterial RNA polymerases [62]. After cultivation 
with 75 mg/L rifamycin, the μ of IME strain (0.090   h−1) 
decreased by 68% as compared to that of the control 
strain (0.280   h−1, P = 0.006) (Fig.  6g). Sulfonamides rep -
resent a class of antimicrobial drugs that inhibit bacterial 
folic acid synthesis [63]. We challenged the strains with 
10 mg/L sulfadiazine, and found that the growth of IME 
strain terminated much earlier (11 h vs. 20 h) than that of 
the control strain; the maximum cell mass  (OD550 ~ 0.7) 
achieved for the IME strain was 36% lower than that for 
the control strain  (OD550 ~ 1.1) (Fig. 6h). A similar phe -
nomenon was observed in the presence of sulfameth -
oxazole and trimethoprim combination (SMZ–TMP) 
(Fig.  6i). Polymyxins bind to lipopolysaccharide and 
disrupt the outer membrane of gram-negative bacteria 
[64]. Although the IME strain strengthened cell mem -
brane, polymyxins still efficiently inhibited the growth 
of IME strain. In the presence of 0.9 mg/L of polymyxin 
B, the control strain exhibited a lag phase that lasted for 
4 h. However, the lag phase doubled to 8 h for the IME 
strain (Fig.  6j). We speculated that this might be caused 
by that (S)-2,3-oxidosqualene mainly locates in the inner 
membrane of the IME strain. Beta-lactam antibiotics can 
destroy bacteria by interfering with cell wall synthesis 
[65]. We challenged the strains with 3 mg/L carbenicillin 
or 0.02 mg/L meropenem, and found that the IME strain 
had no tolerance (Fig. 6k, l). All these results demonstrate 
that IME strain can be effectively inhibited by the most 
commonly used antibiotics, showing no undesirable drug 
resistance.
Discussion
Traditional tolerance engineering efforts of E. coli heavily 
rely on exploitation of the potential of itself alone [17–
19], here we sought to introduce a heterologous lipid, 
(S)-2,3-oxidosqualene, into E. coli. For the first time, 
this non-native and eukaryotes-featured chemical was 
found to greatly alter the membrane properties, includ -
ing decreasing the cell membrane leakage and increasing 
intracellular ATP content of E. coli, and finally improve E. 
coli robustness.
Here we introduced the heterologous SQS and SMO 
enzymes and further activated the native MEP pathway 
for enhancing (S)-2,3-oxidosqualene synthesis. As MEP 
pathway is often tightly regulated in E. coli [36] and (S)-
2,3-oxidosqualene represents a eukaryotic molecule, 
replacement of the MEP pathway with MVA pathway 
in E. coli [66] can be performed to further increase the 
synthesis of (S)-2,3-oxidosqualene [67, 68]. In addition, 
adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) can serve as another 
strategy to further improve biosynthesis of (S)-2,3-oxi -
dosqualene through beneficial mutations [69], given that 
Reyes et  al. had employed the ALE to improve carot -
enoids production in S. cerevisiae by exploiting the anti -
oxidant properties of carotenoids [70].
In this study, the IME strain showed an increase in 
intracellular ATP content when challenged with stresses 
such as  H2O2. We speculated that this phenomenon is 
associated with the decrease in cell membrane leakage 
due to integration of (S)-2,3-oxidosqualene. Specifically, 
in E. coli, the electrochemical concentration gradient of 
protons across inner membrane is employed to generate 
ATP through ATP synthase [71]. In the control strain, the 
presence of membrane-damaging chemical  H2O2 would 
greatly disrupt this gradient of protons, thus compro -
mising the ATP synthesis. In contrast, under the same 
condition, integration of (S)-2,3-oxidosqualene led to 
a significant decrease in cell membrane leakage, which 
contributes to maintaining the gradient of protons and 
ATP synthesis.
Prior studies have been performed before to improve 
the robustness of E. coli membranes by introducing non-
native membrane compounds. In particular, Caforio et al. 
introduced the archaeal ether lipid biosynthesis genes in 
E. coli, constructed a stable hybrid heterochiral mem -
brane and revealed that it exhibited a higher tolerance 
to l-butanol [72]. Santoscoy and Jarboe exploited the 
promiscuity of squalene hopene cyclase, and introduced 
it into E. coli to produce cholesterol-like molecules, 
which efficiently improves E. coli robustness and produc -
tion capacity [73]. However, these strategies frequently 
take effect to only one certain stress [20–22, 74], our 
study showed that integration of the heterologous (S)-
2,3-oxidosqualene enabled E. coli improved tolerance to 
multiple adverse stresses (Figs.  3–5), which is not easily 
accessible through current engineering methods. These 
adverse stresses include a variety of adverse environ -
mental conditions of industrial relevance and can impact 
the process cost. Specifically, the increased thermotoler -
ance could be useful in industrial applications by reduc -
ing cooling water usage and decreasing the probability 
of contamination. Increased tolerance to low pH can be 
applied to reducing base addition for maintaining the 
optimal pH. In addition, the increased osmotic pressures 
tolerance can be applied to the conditions with high-salt 
and high-sugar challenges, i.e., increased tolerance to 
high sugar can be applied to cultivation E. coli with a high 
initial sugar concentration for minimizing sugar feeding. 
In addition to adverse conditions, IME improved toler -
ances to inhibitors in feedstocks, including lignocellulose 
Page 11 of 14
Sun et al. Biotechnology for Biofuels and Bioproducts          (2023) 16:191 
 
hydrolysate, suggesting its potential for using cheap and 
renewable feedstocks. In addition, IME increased toler -
ance and production of inhibitory bioproducts such as 
organic acids, which provides a better alternative chassis 
to naturally existing E. coli for metabolic engineers and 
synthetic biologists.
Here we also observed that the IME strain showed 
increased sensitivity to most of antibiotics. We specu -
lated that this would be due to that integration of het -
erologous (S)-2,3-oxidosqualene into the cell membrane 
might affect the numbers and activities of antibiotics 
transporters [75]. In particular, up-regulation of antibi -
otics importers and/or down-regulation of antibiotics 
efflux pumps would contribute to the increased intracel -
lular concentration of antibiotics in IME strain [76], and 
thus enabled IME strain to increase sensitivity to these 
antibiotics.
In summary, consistent with our initial plan to con -
struct a super-robust E. coli chassis, like Iron Man, the 
IME not only has super strength and durability (increas -
ing membrane integrity) to withstand damage (resisting 
to heat, high pressure, ROS, toxic feedstocks and inhibi -
tory products), but also has super power (higher ATP 
energy) and abilities (production of a variety of inhibitory 
chemicals). More importantly, IME can be easily con -
trolled by human beings.

online supporting material.
Strains and plasmids
All plasmids and strains used in this study are listed in 
Table  S1. All strains are derivatives of E. coli MG1655. 
One-step recombination (FLP–FRT) [77] and CRISPR–
Cas9 method [78] were used for chromosomal edit -
ing. Gene screening was performed by protein soluble 
expression in E. coli. Candidate genes were cloned into 
the P1 site of pCDF-duet1 vector, and introduced to E. 
coli strain BL21(DE3), under 0.1  mM IPTG induction 
to test their solubility. Gene of tErg9, smo was inserted, 
respectively, at mgsA, pta site and controlled by consti -
tutive promoter M1–93 [79]. The native promoter of idi  
gene was replaced with M1–46 promoter.
Growth conditions and characterization
All tolerance experiments were performed in 200μL 
MOPS + 2% (wt/v) glucose medium [80] in clear-bottom 
96-well plate at 37 °C with an initial pH of 7.0. High tem -
perature tolerance was assessed at 42  °C, all other tol -
erance experiments were performed at 37  °C. Specific 
growth rate μ  (h−1) was calculated by fitting the equation 
 OD550,t =  OD550,0  eμt to the exponential growth phase. All 
estimated μ values had an  R2 of at least 0.95.
Protein expression and gel electrophoresis
The recombinant strains BL21(DE3)::tErg9, 
BL21(DE3)::SMOMc were grown in LB medium, Antibi -
otics were added with respect to the plasmid(s) present 
in the strain(s). The cultures were induced with 0.1 mM 
IPTG at ~ 0.6  OD600. The cells were harvested at 4  h 
after induction, and centrifuged at 10,000 g and 4 °C for 
5 min. The cell pellets were washed twice with 100 mM 
potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0) and resuspended 
in the same buffer. The cells were disrupted using a 
French Pressure Cell (FA-078A, Thermo Electron Corp.; 
Waltham, MA) at1,250 psi. The cell lysates were centri -
fuged at 25,000 g for 30 min and the supernatants were 
used for SDS–PAGE. Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250 was 
used to stain the proteins. The recombinant protein band 
intensities on SDS–PAGE were determined using Scion 
image analyzing software (Scion Corp., Frederick, MD).
Extraction and detection of (S)‑2,3‑oxidosqualene
(S)-2,3-oxidosqualene were extracted by a modified 
Christoph Müller method [81]. Briefly, 10  mg of mid-
log phase E. coli cells were collected, washed twice with 
1 × phosphate-buffered saline, and mixed with 1 mL 2 M 
sodium hydroxide (NaOH). Flood the mixture with nitro-
gen and vortex vigorously for 1  min, this mixture was 
subsequently placed at 70  °C for 1  h for saponification. 
Then allow the suspension cool to room temperature and 
transferred to a fresh tube, 650 µL methyl-tert-butylether 
(MtBE) and 100  µL of internal standard (5α-cholestane 
in MtBE, 10 µg/mL) were added. Next, this mixture was 
vigorously hand vortexed and centrifuged, and the upper 
organic layer was transferred to a fresh tube. The lysed 
cell suspension was extracted once more with another 
750 µL of MtBE. The initial and the second organic lay -
ers were combined and dried under nitrogen. Then, 850 
µL of MtBE was added to redissolve the dried powder. 
Subsequently, 100 µL of cholesterol standard (10 µg/mL) 
and 50  µL of MSTFA/TSIM (9:1) (i.e. a combination of 
N-methyl-N-trimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (MSTFA) 
with 10% (vol/vol) N-trimethylsilylimidazole (TSIM)) 
were added to the sample, which was then placed at 22 °C 
for at least 0.5 h before being analyzed by GC–MS [82].
Membrane Characterization
Membrane integrity was analyzed by SYTOX green (Inv -
itrogen) staining [37], membrane fluidity was analyzed by 
1,6-diphenyl-1,3,5-hexatriene (DPH) (Invitrogen) [38].

Intracellular ATP content characterization
The intracellular ATP content was measured using an 
ATP assay kit (Beyotime) according to the manufacture’s 
introductions.
Production of 3‑HP or fatty acid using the IME strain
For 3-HP production, the overnight culture was inoc -
ulated into fresh M9 + 2.0% (wt/v) glycerol medium 
with an initial  OD550 = 0.1. The inducer isopropyl-β-D-
thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and the coenzyme vita -
min  B12 were added at a final concentration of 0.1  mM 
and 4 μM, respectively. Cultures were grown at 37  ℃ and 
220  rpm for 72  h, and the concentration of 3-HP was 
determined by HPLC as described following. For fatty 
acid production, the overnight culture was inoculated 
into fresh MOPS + 2.0% (wt/v) glucose medium with an 
initial  OD550 = 0.1. As the  OD550 reached ~ 0.6, 0.1  mM 
IPTG was added. Cultures were grown at 30 ℃ and 
220 rpm for 72 h. SCFA was extracted and analyzed using 
GC–MS [83]. LCFA was extracted and analyzed using 
GC–MS [58].
Analytical methods of cells and for the fermentation 
products
The cell concentrations were measured in a 10-mm 
path-length cuvette using a double-beam spectropho -
tometer (Lambda 20, Perkin-Elmer; Norwalk, CT). One 
unit of absorbance at 600  nm corresponded to 0.333  g 
dried cell mass per liter. The concentration of 3-HP was 
determined by HPLC using refractive index (RI) detec -
tor (HPLC, Agilent 1100 series, USA). Supernatants, 
obtained by centrifugation of culture samples at 10,000 g 
for 5  min, were filtered through 0.2  mM Tuffryn-mem -
branes (Acrodisc, Pall Life Sciences) and eluted through a 
300 mm 7.8 mm Aminex HPX-87H (Bio-Rad, USA) col -
umn at 35 °C using 5 mM  H2SO4. The flow rate and the 
flow cell temperature were set at 0.5 ml   min−1 and 60 °C, 
respectively. The injection volume was 20 µl.
Statistical analysis
The two-tailed t test method was employed to analyze 
the statistical significance of all the data in this study.
