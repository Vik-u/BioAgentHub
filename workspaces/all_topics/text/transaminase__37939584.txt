ABSTRACT The experiment was implemented to
assess the inﬂuence of dietary supplementation of laying
quails with creatine monohydrate (CrM), L-carnitine
(CAR) and their mixture (CrMCAR) as antioxidants
against oxidative stress (OS) induced by 2.5 ppm lead
acetate (LA) in drinking water on productive, physio-
logical and microbial aspects. In total, 400 laying quail
females at 10 wk of age were divided into a randomized
design with 5 groups and 4 replicates of 20 birds each.
Birds were fedad libitumwith a balanced diet for 8 wk.
The control group was kept under no-stress conditions
and was given fresh water without any additives (G1).
While birds in other groups were exposed to OS induced
experimentally by 2.5 ppm LA in drinking water with
no feed additive (G2) or supplemented with 500 mg/kg
CrM (G3) or 500 mg/kg CAR (G4) or combination of
250 mg/kg each of CrM and CAR (CrMCAR, G5) to
feed mixture.
Compared to G2, G5 demonstrated the reduction (P ≤
0.05) of feed conversion ratio, feed intake, mortality and
ileal total coliform, as well as serum and egg
malondialdehyde and serum lipid hydroperoxide, uric
acid, glucose, cholesterol, enzymatic activities (alanine
aminotransferase, aspartate transaminase, alkaline
phosphatase, creatine phosphokinase, g-glutamyl
transferase), and heterophils/lymphocytes ratio. In the
meanwhile, there was an increase (P ≤ 0.05) in egg pro-
duction, egg mass, and weight with the improvement of
egg quality, serum sex hormones level and ileal lactic
acid bacteria for G5 followed by G4 and G3. Moreover,
G5 enhanced (P ≤ 0.05), the total antioxidant capacity
of egg and serum glutathione, superoxide dismutase,
catalase, glutathione peroxidase, protein and calcium
levels. Therefore, dietary CrMCAR, CAR and CrM
have analogous inﬂuence to control by improving the
antioxidant and physiological parameters which
resulted in better productive performance and egg
characteristics of stressed quails. These antioxidants,
especially in their equal combination, are beneﬁcial to
alleviate oxidative stress incidence and can be recom-
mended for poultry feeding under various aspects of
environmental stresses.

INTRODUCTION
Many external stressors in avian species play a unique
role in the passive modiﬁcation of metabolic and physio-
logical phenomena which is due to the overproduction
the reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and their harm-
ful free radicalsin vivo (Est/C19evez, 2015; Al-Shammari et
al., 2019a). Oxidative stress (OS) gives a basic indicator
during exposure to climatic, nutritional, chemical, physi-
cal, behavioral, and psychological stressors. The OS
causes prolonged oxidative damage to essential parts of
cells and living tissues through the endogenous imbal-
ance of antioxidant and prooxidants pathways ( Al-
Shammari and Batkowska, 2021). Thus, a cooperatively
complex network of internally and externally powerful
antioxidants preserves the efﬁcient redox system in the
body and this could impact positively for activation of
gene expression, homeostasis maintenance, regulation of
cell signaling and nuclear transcription factors (Surai et
al., 2019; Surai and Earle-Payne, 2022). The OS is char-
acterized by its detrimental inﬂuence on various physio-
logical characteristics of domestic poultry by decreased
antioxidant proﬁle and increased oxidative injury for
cellular lipids, proteins, carbohydrates and genetic mate-
rial (Al-Shammari et al., 2019a; Surai et al., 2019). To
reduce the OS incidence and optimize antioxidant

defense, many researchers attempted toﬁnd out various
antioxidant materials incorporated in diet either from
natural or artiﬁcial sources as optimal procedures to
meet and maintain the physiological needs of poultry
under stressful conditions.
Creatine is a nitrogenous constituent produced by
cooperative metabolism in hepatic, renal and pancreatic
tissues, which is composed of methionine, arginine, and
glycine or from its precursor, guanidine acetic acid
(GAA)( Wu, 2020). Phosphocreatine is a natural com-
pound of creatine in muscle which exerts a pivotal
importance during anaerobic stress as the source of
energy essential for muscleﬁbers contraction, maintain-
ing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels and reducing
accumulation of lactic acid in muscle (Wyss and Kad-
durah-Daouk, 2000; Zhang et al., 2014). Generally, in
animal cells, adenosine diphosphate ( ADP) accepts
phosphate groups from phosphocreatine and, therefore,
ADP is converted into ATP which has in turn ergogenic
effects (Wang et al., 2015; Ibrahim et al., 2019). It was
found that creatine or its derivative form, creatine
monohydrate (CrM) used as a powerful feed additive
by exhibiting its palliative and antioxidant properties
against transport stress (Zhang et al., 2014, 2017) and
thermal stress (Al-Tamimi et al., 2019) in broiler chick-
ens, and more recently, to counteract the overall OS in
Japanese quails (Al-Shammari, 2023).
L-carnitine (CAR) is a water-soluble product and
free radicals scavenger with a multifunctional antioxida-
tive mechanism where found in microorganisms and ani-
mal and plant cells. In animals, CAR is endogenously
biosynthesized in the liver from precursor amino acids
(methionine and lysine) with the existence of many vita-
mins as cofactors such as vitamins (C, B3, B6, and B9)
and iron (Arslan, 2006; Surai, 2015). Higher demand for
CAR from exogenous sources is increasingly required
during enhanced metabolic efﬁciency and stressful envi-
ronment to modify lipid and glucose metabolism in poul-
try (Arslan, 2006; Rehman et al., 2017). CAR is an
indispensable molecule, biochemically linked with the
transfer of long-chain fatty acids to oxidize them for
energy generation in the mitochondrial matrix through
the functional property of acyltransferases (Adabi et al.,
2011). Also, CAR plays role in energy generation from
glucose because of the regulatory inﬂuence of CAR on
the mechanism of pyruvate dehydrogenase that controls
energy pathways connected with the citric acid cycle,
and glycolysis ( Ringseis et al., 2018 ). It was well
reported that dietary supplementation of CAR could
promote growth performance and improve the hemato-
biochemical status, redox reaction, immune system as
well as the semen characteristics for broilers and layers
under different speciﬁed doses and feeding durations
(Adabi et al., 2011; Rehman et al., 2017; ¸Cetin and
G€u¸cl€u, 2020).
Based on our previously published data (Al-Sham-
mari, 2023), we tested the single effect of CrM and CAR
or their synergistic effect in the diet of meat-type Japa-
nese quails under oxidative stress conditions. However,
the same doses of these additives and the potential
impacts as antioxidants have not been hypothesized on
laying performance under similar conditions. Therefore,
in the current experiment, several variables of the inﬂu-
ences of dietary supplementation of CrM, CAR and their
combination (CrMCAR) on productivity, eggs quality,
ileal microﬂora, antioxidative status, and physiology of
laying type Japanese quails exposed to induced oxida-
tive stress were investigated.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
This research was performed at the poultry house and
labs of the Al-Musaib Technical College following the
recommendations on the ethics of working on animals of
the Scientiﬁc Committee in the Department of Animal
Production Techniques, Al-Musaib Technical College,
Al-Furat Al-Awsat Technical University, Babylon, Iraq.
In total, 400 healthy Japanese quail females at 10 wk
of age with similar body weights (171§ 0.4 g) were cho-
sen and reared for 8 wk. Birds were randomly assigned
into 5 groups and 4 replicates with 20 birds in each. The
birds in each replicate were individually identiﬁed with
wing marks and kept in 90£ 80 £ 30 cm wire cages
equipped with feeders and drinkers. The environmental
conditions were automatically controlled with the provi-
sion of a comfortable temperature (24 °C), optimal ven-
tilation, and humidity and with lighting program of 16 h
of light:8 h of darkness/d. Birds were fedad libitumwith
a balanced diet prepared in accordance with NRC
(1994) to meet their nutritional requirements (Table 1).
Birds in the control group were kept under no-stress
conditions and were given fresh drinking water without
any additives (G1). While birds in other groups were
exposed to OS induced experimentally by 2.5 ppm of
lead acetate (LA) in drinking water with no feed addi-
tive (G2) or supplemented with 500 mg/kg CrM (G3) or
500 mg/kg CAR (G4) or combination of 250 mg/kg
each of CrM and CAR (CrMCAR, G5) to feed mixture.
LA (99% purity) was obtained from a commercial pro-
ducer (Lab Tech Chemicals, Ginsheim-Gustavsburg,

Germany) in powdery form (Al-Shammari and Batkow-
ska, 2021; Al-Shammari, 2023). It was dissolved and pre-
pared into pure drinking water and served to birds daily.
The creatine monohydrate ( CrM) and L-carnitine
(CAR) (Shandong Longchang Animal Health Product
Co., Jinan, China) were added singly or in combination
to the diet daily. These dietary additives were in pow-
dery form, mixed into diet thoroughly and homo-
geneously and then packaged in sealed polypropylene
woven sacks to keep their antioxidant activity from
probable noxious impacts of the external environment.
The productive traits such as feed intake (FI), water
intake (WI), and mortality (MORT) were registered
daily and their values are presented periodically every 4
wk (10−14 and 15−18 wk of birds age) for each replica-
tion in group. Eggs were collected, counted, and weighed
daily in each cage and by multiplying egg weight (EW)
with egg production, the egg mass (EM) per hen was
calculated. The feed conversion ratio (FCR) was calcu-
lated by dividing the grams of FI by grams of egg mass
or number of eggs. The average percentage values of
hen-day egg production (HD) and HD as egg per hen in
particular experimental periods were calculated ( Al-
Shammari et al., 2019b). The protein efﬁciency ratio
(PER) was estimated as EM per crude protein intake,
and the energy efﬁciency ratio (EER) was estimated as
EM per 100 kcal of metabolizable energy intake. More-
over, average body weight (BW) was individually mea-
sured for each bird in replicate at 14th at 18th wk.
Internal and external egg quality were measured
twice, after 4 and 8 wk of experiment by taking 40 fresh
eggs from each group (n = 10/replicate). The following
quality traits of egg were evaluated:
1. Whole egg

/C15 egg shape index (EI) as a ratio of the equatorial
axis to the longitudinal one using a digital vernier
caliper;

per;
/C15 eggshell volume (SV) was obtained by multiplying
the ESA (cm2) with ST (cm) as it was mentioned
by Shafey (2002).
3. Albumen
/C15 albumen weight (AW) using a digital scale with
an accuracy of 0.01 g;
/C15 albumen height (AH) using a digital vernier caliper;
/C15 Haugh unit (HU) was calculated based onEisen et
al. (1962);
4. Yolk
/C15 yolk weight (YW) using a digital scale with an
accuracy of 0.01 g;
/C15 yolk index (YI) as a ratio of the yolk height to its
diameter;
/C15 yolk color (YC) using the 16-point scale (DSM
YolkFan, Basel, Switzerland).
Samples of yolk and albumen were homogenized sepa-
rately well using a blender and cooled to 4 °C in 50 mM
phosphate buffer and then centrifuged (Muchacka et al.,
2018). The collected supernatants were stored at/C0 20 °C
and used for redox markers determination. Lipid peroxi-
dation in the egg was estimated by measuring the level of
malondialdehyde (MDA) in both egg albumen and yolk
using thiobarbituric acid following the method ofDraper
and Hadeley (1990). The ferric-reducing ability of plasma
(FRAP) assay was used for the determination of total
antioxidant activity (TAC) expressed as mg gallic acid
equivalents (GAE) per g of aqueous solutions of egg yolk
and albumen based on a slightly modiﬁed procedure of
Benzie and Strain (1996).
At the end of the experiment 4 birds from each replica-
tion were randomly selected and, after 10 h of starvation,
blood samples were collected twice from the same bird.
The ﬁrst sample was taken by puncture of a brachial vein,
the second one was collected immediately after slaughter
from the jugular vein. One part of harvested blood was put
in anticoagulant tubes containing K3EDTA to enumerate
the heterophil to lymphocyte ratio (H/L)( Burton and
Guion, 1968) and to investigate FRAP value in plasma,
following the spectrophotometric methodology (Benzie
and Strain, 1996). The other part of the collected blood
was placed into a gel separator tube to separate serum by
centrifugation at 3,000 RPM for 15 min. and thereafter all
serum samples were preserved at/C0 25°C until the execu-
tion time of other analyses.
The serum redox indicators involving MDA and lipid
hydroperoxide (LOOH) were estimated according to
Salih et al. (1987)and S€odergren et al. (1998), respec-
tively. The analytical procedures ofMisra and Fridovich
(1972) and Aebi (1984) were followed to determine the
antioxidative enzyme sets such as superoxide dismutase
(SOD), catalase (CAT), and glutathione peroxidase
(GPx). The commercial kits (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis,
MO) were used to implement all redox analyses using a
spectrophotometer (Shenzhen, China). Also, the quantita-
tive colorimetric method based on guidelines of diagnostic
bioassay kit (Bioxytech GSH-420, OXIS Research, Port-
land, OR) was used to measure glutathione (GSH) level.
ANTIOXIDANTS: CREATINE & CARNITINE IN LAYERS 3
Moreover, a spectrophotometric method was carried
out by using respective commercial kits (Biolabo, Maizy,
France) to determine the serum biochemical indices as
follow: total protein (TP), calcium (Ca), phosphorus
(P)( Young, 2000), creatinine (CREA), uric acid (UA),
total cholesterol (CHOL), and alkaline phosphatase
(ALP)( Burtis and Ashwood, 1999). A commercial kit
(Cromatest, Barcelona, Spain) was also used for glucose
value detection (Young, 2000). The standard protocol of
Reitman and Frankel (1957)stated in the Randox enzy-
matic test kit (VirtualExpo Group, Marseille, France)
was implemented to determine the activity of alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate transaminase
(AST). Concerning the calculation of the activity of cre-
atine phosphokinase (CPK) and gamma-glutamyl trans-
ferase (GGT), the spectrophotometric method proposed
by Tietz (1986) was followed by a commercial kit
(Ortho-Clinical Diagnostics, Raritan, NJ).
For hormonal analyses in serum, the enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) microplate reader (BK-
EL10C, Biobase, Shandong, China) was run to register
the absorbance according to the strict steps stated in
commercially speci ﬁc enzyme-radioimmunoassay kit
(IDS, Boldon, UK) to quantify of corticosterone (COR)
level. Also, respective kits of ELISA (Baolai Biotechnol-
ogy Co., Ltd., Shandong, China) were used to determine
sex hormones including estradiol ( E2), progesterone
(P4), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing
hormone (LH) following the methodology reported by
the manufacturer.
In total, 40 birds were slaughtered according to eutha-
nasia protocol. After slaughtering and dissection of the
gut, 40 samples of ileum content (n = 2/replicate) were
gently collected. Ileum contents were placed into sterile
tubes and immediately used to examine the microbial
population. After all microbial samples were subjected
to anaerobic diluents of serial dilution (10
/C0 4−10/C0 6) and
inoculated with sterile agar, the procedure ofBryant
and Burkey (1953) was followed to perform microbial
analysis. For each selective culture, a speciﬁc agar was
used to grow and account for the total aerobic bacteria
and speciﬁc colony type of coliforms, lactic acid bacteria,
Escherichia coli, Salmonella spp. (Manaﬁ et al., 2016)
and total fungal counts (Speak, 1984) under various
times and temperatures of microbial plate incubation
and inoculation. After enumeration, the microbial data
per 1 g of ileum were converted and expressed as log10
colony-forming units (log10 CFU/g of wet weight).
Also, the digest ( n = 2/replicate) were collected
gently from gizzard, small intestine and large intestine
segments separately and preserved at/C0 20°C in Eppen-
dorf-type tubes until pH determination. Brieﬂy, by tak-
ing 1 g of content then mixing and shaking it with 2 g of
distilled water and afterward recording 3 readings per
content using a pH meter (PHS-550, Lohand Biological
Co., Zhejiang, China) according to the procedure of
Chaveerach et al. (2004).
The statistical analysis of the data obtained was per-
formed SAS software ( SAS, 2012). The differences
among the experimental groups were veriﬁed using a
general linear model and 1-way ANOVA with Duncan’s
multiple range test (Duncan, 1955) to compare the par-
ticular means. The signiﬁcance level of P < 0.05 was
applied using the following model: Yij =m +Ti +eij,
where Yij is the observation value;m is the overall mean;
Ti is the treatment group effect (G1−G5), andeij is the
random error.
RESULTS
In Table 2 the traits characterizing Japanese quails’
productivity were shown. The best effect on the body
weight at the end of particular experimental periods was
achieved in birds from group G1 but also G5, treated
with a combination of CAR and CrM against induced
oxidative stress. Signiﬁcantly the lowest feed intake (P
≤ 0.05) was found in the G2 group (positive control)
with the highest in the case of FI in G1 (kept without
any additives) and G3 (with CrM additive). Very similar
relationships between groups were demonstrated by the
water intake, the highest was estimated for G1 and G3
followed by G4, G5, and G2 exclusively inﬂuenced by
oxidative stress. The FCR both calculated per g of egg
as well as per egg, had the lowest values in group G5,
given the combination of CAR and CrM against oxida-
tive stress. The lowest PER characterized G2 with the
highest in the G5 group irrespective of the analyzing
period. Similar relationships between groups were stated
in energy efﬁciency. The biggest EM (P ≤ 0.05) was pro-
duced by birds in the control group (G1), regardless of
the experimental period, followed by groups with antiox-
idant factors (G5, G3, and G4) with the smallest in the
OS group (G2). The highest egg production (HD) was
achieved by quails in the negative control group (G1)
and then in G5 (CrMCAR), G3 (CrM), G4 (CAR), and
G2. In between 15 and 18 wk of age birds in all groups
had lower HD values than in theﬁrst period (10−14 wk)
probably resulting from the fact that birds were after
the peak production. The best liveability (lowest
MORT) was stated in G1 with the worst in the G2
group, all groups supplemented with antioxidant factors
did not differ according to the substance used.
In Table 3traits of the whole eggs as well as the egg-
shell were presented. The egg weight increased with the
age of birds in all groups except G2, as well as all groups
achieved a higher value of this trait than G2 at 15 to 18
wk (P ≤ 0.05). Birds in groups G1 and G4 laid consider-
ably more rounded eggs (EI) than in other groups
regardless of the analysis term. Eggs from G1, G4, and
G5 were characterized by the highest eggshell weight
and thickness compared to G2 and G3. The calculated
eggshell parameters (ESA, SV) demonstrated the high-
est values in G1 and G5 groups, however, the lowest
SWUSA was found in G3 concerning higher levels in all
other groups.
The egg content traits were presented in Table 4.
Considerably worse (P ≤ 0.05) quality of albumen, mea-
sured by its height (AH) and Haugh units, was demon-
strated by eggs derived from G2 and G3 groups, stayed

under oxidative stress induced and without supplemen-
tation or supplemented with CrM. The best quality of
this egg element characterized eggs from negative con-
trol (G1) and G5. At the same time, signiﬁcantly the
biggest yolks (YW, YI) and more intensively colored
yolk (YC) were found in G1, G4, and G5 concerning
other groups.
Based on results of blood and serum analysis shown in
Table 5the decrease (P ≤ 0.05) in H/L was only present
in G5 and G1 compared to G2. In comparison to G2,
there was a lowering in LOOH and MDA levels with an
increase of FRAP and CAT in serum of the G4, G5, and
G1 groups. Also, GSH was enhanced by all experimental
groups compared to positive control (G2), which stayed
under oxidative stress, whereas elevated values of SOD
and GPx were achieved by G1, G3, and G5. The
lowering (P ≤ 0.05) of MDA in egg albumen was regis-
tered in G1 and G5 without any differences in this vari-
able in egg yolk. Decreased level (P ≤ 0.05) of TAC in
egg albumen was for G2 and G4 and in G2 and G3 in
yolk.
Table 6indicates that the signiﬁcant increase of TP in
serum was in favor of all treated groups (G3, G4, G5)
and negative control (G1) compared to positive one.
Low values of glucose, uric acid and AST were for G4,
G5, and G1. The G3 and G5 obtained a lowering (P ≤
0.05) in CHOL and CPK with high Ca values, their lev-
els were similar to those in G1. Besides, a lower ALT,
ALP and GGT activity (P ≤ 0.05) was only reported in
G5 and G1 (negative control). LA (oxidative stress fac-
tor) caused a signiﬁcant decrease in P level in G2 com-
pared to G1, opposite trends were shown by CREA.

As it was shown inTable 7, the higher (P ≤ 0.05)
average level of serum hormones (E2, FSH, and LH) in
the G4 and G5 groups was stated. The progesterone
(P4) level was also signiﬁcantly higher but only in G4.
In mentioned groups, these indices had similar values as
in G1 in comparison to G2.
According to data presented inTable 8, a signiﬁcantly
lower count ofE. coli in groups in which the oxidative
stress was induced (G3−G5) was found as well as in G1
in comparison to G2 positive control. Elevated count (P
≤ 0.05) of lactic acid bacteria was presented by G3, G5,
and G1 compared to G2. In addition, the lowest counts
(P ≤ 0.05) of total coliform and total aerobic bacteria
were indicated by G5 and G1 than G2. Similar relation-
ships between groups were stated in the case of total
fungi. No signi ﬁcant differences were documented
among groups regarding Salmonella spp. count. The
change of pH was only found in gizzard, the decrease (P
≤ 0.05) of this parameter was registered for G4 and G1
compared to G2. Moreover, no change among groups
was in small and large intestines pH.
DISCUSSION
The ameliorative effects of CrMCAR followed by
CAR and CrM in G5, G4, and G3, respectively, were
obvious to counteract the OS incidence by optimizing
the overall productive performance in birds during all
experimental periods. This might be due to the active
interplay between CrM and CAR. It was found that rap-
idly absorbed creatine (Cr) and its chemical forms bio-
logically support the growth by different mechanisms
such as stimulating the digestive enzymes and preserv-
ing the metabolic activity of necessary energy (Wyss
and Kaddurah-Daouk, 2000). Due to the Cr antioxidant
action, it could protect the growing muscles from vulner-
ability and modulates glycolytic pathways in sarcoplasm
(Lawler et al., 2002 ). These phenomena probably
reﬂected the increases in BW, reduced FI and improved
FCRs for G5. Moreover, the marked superiority in HDs
and EM parameters in groups with antioxidant factors
could be reﬂected by enhanced levels of serum gonadal
steroid sex hormones especially in G5 and G4 (Table 7)
affecting directly the eggs production. These alterations
might result from the myoblast differentiation through
myostatin downregulating and myogenin upregulating
with upregulated genes levels of growth hormone and
insulin-like growth factor-1 in hepatic or pectoral tissues
during feeding Cr as it was indicated for broilers (Chen
et al., 2011) and Mulard ducks (Ibrahim et al., 2019).
The important molecular action of CrM in stressed birds
is probably to preserve metabolic energy by reduced
rapid glycolysis and enhanced ATP production in mus-
cle which is governed by down regulated genes of adeno-
sine 5
0-monophosphate-activated protein kinasea2 and
liver kinase B1 in hepatic tissue (Zhang et al., 2017).
Therefore, the modulation of the reproductive system

ANTIOXIDANTS: CREATINE & CARNITINE IN LAYERS 7
and synthetic genes for egg proteins and lipids are prob-
ably indirectly inﬂuenced by these molecular events in
ovarian and oviductal muscles.
The possible reason for bigger feed consumption (FI)
in CAR group might be connected to the considerable
improvement of villus height in the small intestine and
thus increase nutrient absorption ( Eskandani et al.,
2022). Besides, it was found that dietary CAR had a
stimulatory impact on intestinal enzymes secretion
which is responsible for nutrient digestibility and reduc-
tion of lipogenesis (Ringseis et al., 2018), although, in
our date a numerical superiority in FCRs for G4 com-
pared to G2 was found. Also, it is possible that Cr in
CrMCAR is characterized by its fast distribution in
plasma and growing tissues, participates in protein syn-
thesis and then causes to increase PER (Ibrahim et al.,
2019). Due to the stressful condition during laying peri-
ods in G3, G4, and G5, there was a motivating effect on
birds which fed these antioxidative supplements to con-
sume escalated amounts of water as a defensive way to
mitigate the toxic impacts of LA and decrease the high
accumulation of this pollutant in renal and hepatic tis-
sues (Al-Shammari and Batkowska, 2021; Al-Shammari,
2023).
Dietary CrMCAR, CrM, and CAR proved their efﬁ-
cacy to lower MORT. This might be depended upon the
activation of CrM for the immune system and defensive
immune cells which protect body organisms from carci-
nogenicity, microbial invasion, and overall inﬂammatory
cases (Lawler et al., 2002; Wu, 2020). In addition, it was
shown that increased antibody titers against injurious
viral diseases, elevated levels of immunoglobulins
toward pathogens and alleviated inﬂammatory reactions
are major positive inﬂuences of CAR. This is because of
immune-modulating properties of CAR which lead to
inhibit apoptosis and improve survivability of birds
(Adabi et al., 2011; Rehman et al., 2017; Azizi-Chekosari
et al., 2021).
Undoubtedly, the number of available reports is very
limited to compare with our data regarding inﬂuence of
CrM on overall performance or physiological aspects of
laying poultry, especially under stressful environments.
Nevertheless, in a rare study (Halle et al., 2006), was
found that adding 0.5, 1, and 2 g Cr/kg of diet for laying
hen hybrids for 13 wk increased FI but with no alter-
ation in laying rate and daily EM. A similar result was
obtained byYal¸cin et al. (2005)who conveyed that the
diet containing CAR at 100 mg/kg alone or in a mixture
with 1.5 g humate/kg had no effect in FCR, HD per hen,
BW in laying quails, however, the best EW was achieved
in the group fed with CAR for 16 wk. Also, in accor-
dance, Mousa et al. (2022)observed that feeding ther-
mally stressed laying hens with 100 mg CAR alone or
with 250 mg vitamin C per kg of feed from 29 to 40 wk
increased the eggs production, EM and EW by improved
FCR with no changed FI.
The improvements in measurements of egg quality in
G3, G4, and G5 (Table 3) could result from the fact that
additives used exerted their presumably antioxidative
roles to modulate the ovarian and oviductal function
and stimulate efﬁcient absorption of nutrients trans-
ported into the egg. The Cr has advantageously been
proposed to metabolize energy after its recycling to pro-
duce ATP through CPK in muscular tissues. Also, it
might protect against oxidative, apoptotic, and toxic
reactions in most the vital tissues such as the ovary
(Wu, 2020). Most data focused on the supplementation
of GAA in the diet as precursor and substrate for Cr
endogenous biosynthesis in poultry due to its relatively
low cost. For instance,Raei et al. (2020)noticed that
various levels of GAA (0.6, 1.2, and 1.8 g/kg) from 56 to
154 d of age incorporated in quails diet potentiated
serum and liver antioxidant capacity which reﬂects on
increased EW and YW with no effect on ST, HU, EI and
SW depending on used dose. In ISA Brown laying hens,
Salah et al. (2020)suggested that was a linear increase
in the egg quality involving SW, ST, YW, YI and HU
affected by feeding 0.5, 1.0, and 1.5 g of GAA/kg diet
for 6 wk due to improved antioxidant and energy metab-
olism in the liver. Optimal metabolic rate in the mag-
num by synthesis and secretion of b-ovomucin is
responsible for the gelatinous structure of the thick egg
albumen could be controlled by CAR received in diet
(Ghods-Alavi et al., 2010) and that was visible to opti-
mize HU and AH in current data. Increased YW, YI and
YC might be attributed to the stimulatory inﬂuence of
CAR in the formation of yolk precursors in the hepatic
tissue and then activation of their transport to growing

follicles and mature oocytes from the synthesis sites in
the liver (Ringseis et al., 2018). Additionally, CAR per-
forms its crucial role in the active metabolism of uterine
shell glands (Rouhanipour et al., 2022) and stimulates
higher absorption of vitamin D3 and circulating Ca that
are both indispensable in the integrity of eggshells and
reduces evaporation level of CO
2 from eggshell pores
(Ghods-Alavi et al., 2010). Therefore, these changings
resulted in an improvement of SW in our data. Similarly,
in part,Celik et al. (2004)established that adding 50 mg
CAR/L of drinking water played an indispensable role
in the albumen quality improvement (AW and AH)
with stable ST, although no changes were recorded in
EW, YW, SW, YI, EI, YC, and YW in heat-stressed lay-
ing hens. In other data,Parizadian et al. (2011)observed
that supplementation with CAR (125, 250, and 500 mg/
kg) in a diet of quails for 35 to 70 d did not change EW,
YW, AH, YI, HU, SW.
The stimulatory effects of supplements applied in G3,
G4, and G5 groups on serum redox status through low-
ering lipid peroxidation indicators (LOOH, MDA),
increasing antioxidant enzymes (SOD, CAT, GPx),
FRAP and GSH with decreased H/L were obvious. The
same effect of antioxidant activity was visible in these
groups in the increase of albumen and yolk TAC and
decrease albumen MDA in comparison to G2. The
impaired antioxidant proﬁle in G2 was probably related
to the adverse role of lead by enhanced levels of gene
expression for apoptotic proteins such as caspase-3 and
caspase-9 proteins in laying quail liver, these proteins
induce apoptosis and damage of cellular proteins (Arslan
et al., 2022). It was proved by many results that contin-
uous induction of OS by LA (Al-Shammari and Batkow-
ska, 2021)o rH
2O2 (Al-Shammari et al., 2019a)a s
oxidative stress factors has resulted in a weakening of
the antioxidant protective system by an increase of lipid
peroxidation and inhibition of antioxidant enzymes in
poultry blood. Some injurious free radicals including per-
oxide anions, peroxynitrite and others, that are synthe-
sized in skeletal muscles and brain tissue, could be
deactivated or quenched through an antioxidive mecha-
nism attributed to Cr property. These free radicals
mostly participate in detrimental events of mitochon-
drial impairment such as shortage of cellular ATP and
dysfunction in buffering capacity of body energy that
leads to neurological disorders and congestive heart fail-
ure (Wyss and Kaddurah-Daouk, 2000, Wu, 2020). Con-
trary, Wang et al. (2015) reported that were no
alterations in GPx and SOD activity in muscles of 3 h of
transport-stressed male broilers during summer which
were fed with 600 or 1,200 mg CrM per kg in diet. Our
results corresponded to Zhang et al. (2014)who indi-
cated no effect of 600 or 1,200 mg/kg CrM added to the
diet on plasma COR in 3 h transport induced stress of
male broilers at 42 d of age. The H/L constitutes an
active indicator to show stress response in birds, its
higher value refers to exposure to stress conditions. The
lowering value of H/L in G5 might partially be due to
inﬂuential CrM in this mixture.Al-Tamimi et al. (2019)
found that H/L was inhibited by adding 1.2 g CrM /kg
singly or in combination with 1 g betaine/kg of diet at 5
wk of age of acute thermal-stressed chickens. However,
in current data, the individual CrM tend to have a
numerical decrease only in this value. Improved redox
status in G4 might belong to the antioxidative power of
CAR. Many authors (Adabi et al., 2011; Surai, 2015;
Rehman et al., 2017) suggested that the antioxidant sys-
tem of CAR in the human or avian bodies is strictly
based on various routes including immediate suppres-
sion or damaging of free radicals, metals chelating which
generates the reactive species, deactivating the special
prooxidant enzymes, production of multiple antioxidant
enzymes, regulation of heat shock proteins, modulating
of vitagenes as well as activation of redox-signaling
(Nrf2 and PPARa) which could preserve mitochondrial
integrity. In accordance,¸Cetin and G€u¸cl€u (2020)proved
that 200 mg/kg CAR alone or with different energy lev-
els, applied in layer hens diet mitigated the OS induced
by high stocking density through the increased antioxi-
dant activity of erythrocyte GPx, SOD and CAT with
inhibited plasma MDA value compared to control. In
Hy-Line layers, it was reported that feeding with 100 mg
CAR per kg reduced MDA content with no effect on
total SOD and GPx in serum and unchangeable total
antioxidant capacity at 50 wk of age (Eskandani et al.,
2022). The highest values of TAC content in egg yolk
and albumen in G5 give evidence that egg represents a
potential pathway for redox reaction by active transport
of feed supplements from the diet to main egg compo-
nents (Surai and Earle-Payne, 2022). Thus, CrMCAR
decreased the oxidative susceptibility of the eggs and
improved oxidative stability. Correspondingly,Rouha-
nipour et al. (2022)proved that the total effect of CAR
(100, 200 mg/kg) added to a diet enriched with 2 levels
of n-3 fatty acids did not alter MDA value in the eggs
yolk at 44th wk of Lohmann hens age. This was also in
line with Wang et al. (2021), who found that offering
dietary 1, 10, and 100 mg Pb nitrate as a stressor per kg
BW of ISA Brown layers led to its fast accumulation in
eggshell and yolk which may negatively affect antioxi-
dant egg proﬁle and laying rate.
Amelioration in values of biochemical metabolites
(TP, GLU, CHOL, Ca, CREA, and UA) and enzymatic
values (ALT, AST, ALP, CPK, and GGT) in the serum
of G3 to G5 groups might be driven by the upgrading of
antioxidative markers in blood serum which investigated
during the experiment. It could be suggested that CrM,
CAR and their mixture played key roles by maintaining
TP content with hyperglycemia in ﬂuence in serum
through their possible mechanism as antioxidants in the
blood. Synergistically, CAR in CrMCAR might also
inhibit the expression of the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
coenzyme A reductase activity with increased expression
of cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase which are considered
as regulatory enzymes for cholesterol metabolism in liver
and serum (Rehman et al., 2017; Eskandani et al., 2022).
The decrease in measured enzymes especially in G5
might belong to CrM inﬂuencing the protection from
free radicals production and providing suitable energy
demands during oxidative muscle metabolism (Wyss
ANTIOXIDANTS: CREATINE & CARNITINE IN LAYERS 9
and Kaddurah-Daouk, 2000). Thus, it is clear that the
overproduction of hepatic enzymes in the blood occurs
during damage in hepatocytes and hepatotoxicity
(Est/C19evez, 2015) induced by increasing the electron leak-
age from mitochondria which generate free radicals.
Also, enhanced serum TP and reduced CHOL in G3
could be related to fat-burning properties and acceler-
ated nitrogen metabolism of CrM. Consistent results
proved that there was no effect of 3% Cr offered to the
broiler diet at 42 d of age in changing serum CREA and
ALT content in the liver (Chen et al., 2011). It was
shown that CAR maximized liver and kidney functions
in poultry by mitochondrial protection from inﬂamma-
tion associated with harmful products (Arslan, 2006;
Adabi et al., 2011). This could explain the lower value of
CREA and UA in G4. Identical data, in stressed poultry,
reported increased values of blood ALT, CREA and UA
due to an inappropriate antioxidant defense network
(Al-Shammari et al., 2019b ; Arslan et al., 2022 ).
Decreased Ca level for G2 was in conjunction with low
eggshell quality (Table 3) and this could typically attri-
bute to the inﬂuence of LA on osteoporosis function via
osteoclast activation and osteoblast deactivation which
makes layer hen bones more prone to fractures risk
(Wang et al., 2021). Our data were in line withYal¸cin et
al. (2005) who suggested that was no effect of dietary
CAR in serum ALT, ALP and CPK and CHOL in laying
quails. Differently,Parizadian et al. (2011)indicated low
CHOL and unaltered glucose in the serum of laying quail
fed with CAR supplementation.
Increased levels of reproductive hormones in stressed
groups (G4, G5) are probably linked to activation of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis (HPO) in response
to feeding by CrMCAR and CAR. The metabolic activ-
ity of ovary and oviduct function is modulated by a
molecular mechanism of steroid (E2 and P4) and pitui-
tary gland (FSH and LH) hormones in laying hens
(Zhao et al., 2023). Thus, the enhancement in values of
these sex hormones is probably correlated with promot-
ing more intensive egg production and their high quality
in our study. It is reasonable to postulate that dietary
CAR, individually or in combination with other feed
supplements, protects oocytes membranes from injuri-
ous attacks of free radicals and provides energy supply
to growing oocytes and boosting the sex hormone secre-
tions through HPO (Agarwal et al., 2018). Differently as
indicated by Kazemi-Fard et al. (2015), the level of
plasma E2 was unaffected in Hy-Line W-36 layers by
feeding 50, 100, and 150 mg CAR/kg of diet for 6 wk
except for plasma P4 level which reduced its biosynthe-
sis by 100 mg CAR/kg of diet.
The improved growth of lactic acid bacteria and
impaired growth of total coliform as well as total aerobic
bacteria in the ileum section of G5 was proved inTable 8,
however, no effect in gut pH was induced by G5. This
was probably related to the positive effect of this mix-
ture on the eubiosis of gut microbiota and thus enhanced
PER and EER which give an indicator for the powerful
apparent digestibility of digestible nutrients (Al-Sham-
mari, 2023 ). It is known that metabolic aspects,
secretion of digestive juices, resistance to multiple stres-
sors and toxic substances and expulsion of harmful
pathogens are strictly correlated with beneﬁcial micro-
ﬂora population in the gut of avian species (Shang et al.,
2018). Besides, the dangerous reactive species are natu-
rally suppressed by antioxidant and anti-inﬂammatory
defense mechanism of commensal gut microbiota inhab-
ited in epithelial mucosa through increasing many enzy-
matic and nonenzymatic antioxidants. Thus,
homeostasis and complexity of microbiota affects gut
integrity and health potentially in poultry (Wickrama-
suriya et al., 2022). Azizi-Chekosari et al. (2021)con-
ﬁrmed that a level of 400 CAR mg/kg of diet improved
the numeration of lactobacilli and inhibitedE. coliand
coliforms generally in broilers cecum at 42 d of birds’ age
which is inconsistent with our results.
CONCLUSIONS
It was worth to notice that synergistic level of
CrMCAR (250 mg of CrM + 250 mg of CAR per kg of
diet) followed by using 500 mg of CAR or CrM per kg of
diet separately had an alleviative effect on serum and
egg antioxidant properties of laying quails exposed to
oxidative stress induced by 2.5 ppm LA in drinking
water. Furthermore, the biochemical metabolites as well
as the liver enzymatic activity, sex hormones levels and
ileal microﬂora were improved by these feed additives.
In general, these collectively pivotal changes led toﬁnal
improvement in productive performance and egg quality
during 8 wk of application.
