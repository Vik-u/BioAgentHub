The enzymatic degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) occurs at
mild reaction conditions and may ﬁnd applications in environmentally
friendly plastic waste recycling processes. The hydrolytic activity of the
homologous polyester hydrolases LC cutinase (LCC) from a compost
metagenome and TfCut2 fromThermobiﬁda fusca KW3 against PET ﬁlms
was strongly inﬂuenced by the reaction medium buffers tris(hydrox-
ymethyl)aminomethane (Tris), 3-( N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid
(MOPS), and sodium phosphate. LCC showed the highest initial hydrolysis
rate of PET ﬁlms in 0.2
M Tris, while the rate of TfCut2 was 2.1-fold lower
at this buffer concentration. At a Tris concentration of 1M, the hydrolysis
rate of LCC decreased by more than 90% and of TfCut2 by about 80%.
In 0.2
M MOPS or sodium phosphate buffer, no signiﬁcant differences in
the maximum initial hydrolysis rates of PET ﬁlms by both enzymes were
detected. When the concentration of MOPS was increased to 1
M, the
hydrolysis rate of LCC decreased by about 90%. The activity of TfCut2
remained low compared to the increasing hydrolysis rates observed at
higher concentrations of sodium phosphate buffer. In contrast, the activity
of LCC did not change at different concentrations of this buffer. An inhi-
bition study suggested a competitive inhibition of TfCut2 and LCC by Tris
and MOPS. Molecular docking showed that Tris and MOPS interfered
with the binding of the polymeric substrate in a groove located at the
protein surface. A comparison of the K
i values and the average binding
energies indicated MOPS as the stronger inhibitor of the both enzymes.
Polyethylene terephthalate is a synthetic aromatic
polyester composed of ethylene glycol and terephthalic
acid (TPA) [1]. Because of its versatile properties PET
is used in many products such as textile ﬁbers or bev-
erage bottles. The high strength, low weight, low per-
meability of gases, and its resistance to many
chemicals make PET an excellent packaging material
for a wide range of products [2]. In 2013, about 13%
of all packaging materials were made of PET [3]. The
widespread use of synthetic polyesters such as PET
contributes to growing amounts of postconsumer plas-
tic wastes. The related environmental pollution prob-
lems require efﬁcient recycling processes. The
biocatalytic degradation of PET offers a less energy-
consuming and environmentally friendly method than
conventional recycling processes [4,5]. Hydrolytic activ-
ity against PET has been shown for lipases [1,5–7],
carboxylesterases [ 6–9], and cutinases [ 1,6,7,10].

Several polyester hydrolases from fungi [ 1], actino-
mycetes [5,11–19], and from a compost metagenome
[10,20] have been reported.
The type and ionic strength of buffers can inﬂuence
the enzymatic activity in aqueous reaction systems.
The effect of ions and inorganic salts on the solubility
of proteins has been reported more than 120 years
ago, when Hofmeister proposed a series of cations and
anions according to their ability to precipitate hen egg
white [21]. It has been shown that Hofmeister effects
can also inﬂuence the catalytic activity of enzymes.
The ionic strength as well as the pH of a buffer system
affect the activity and structural features of enzymes.
The activity of immobilizedCandida rugosaand Rhizopus
oryzae lipases was inﬂuenced by the ionic strength of
the buffer and was highest in a mixture of 0.25
M
MOPS and sodium phosphate [22]. In another study,
both buffers as well as salt ions showed speciﬁc
Hofmeister effects on the enzymatic activity of the
C. rugosa lipase [23]. Weak and strong electrolytes
strongly inﬂuenced the enzymatic activity of the lipase.
While sulfate ions increased the activity, chloride
behaved neutrally and thiocyanate strongly decreased
it. The inﬂuence of inorganic salts and ions on the sta-
bility and activity of alkaline phosphatase from calf
intestine has also been shown [24]. The activating and
stabilizing effect of different inorganic salts correlated
well with their kosmotropic and chaotropic properties
proposed in the Hofmeister series. An inﬂuence of the
ionic strength of the buffer system on the hydrolysis of
PET ﬁlms in a membrane reactor by the polyester
hydrolase TfCut2 has also been reported [ 25]. The
highest initial hydrolysis rates were obtained in
Na
2HPO4 buffer at a concentration of 0.7M.
An inhibition of the activity of aminopeptidases and
aminotransferases [26–28], cholinesterases [29], and dif-
ferent carbohydrate hydrolases [ 30–35] by Tris has
been reported. Most of these studies indicated a com-
petitive inhibition of the enzymes by this buffer.
MOPS has been shown to inhibit the activity of bovine
adrenal tyrosine hydroxylase [36]. The related sulfonic
acid buffer 4-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (MES)
also inhibited the metallo- b-lactamase from
Bacteroides fragilis [37].
Previously, we have examined the effect of the ionic
strength of HEPES, MOPS, PIPES, Tris, and sodium
phosphate buffers on the enzymatic hydrolysis of PET
ﬁlms in a membrane reactor [25]. In this study, we
investigate the effect of these buffer types on the
hydrolysis of PET by two polyester hydrolases in fur-
ther detail. The degradation of amorphous PET ﬁlms
by TfCut2 and LCC at different buffer concentrations
was monitored by measuring the released products by
RP-HPLC. An inhibitory effect of Tris and MOPS
buffer on the two hydrolases was investigated experi-
mentally as well as by docking experiments.
Materials and methods
Genes, enzymes and chemicals
The synthetic LCC gene construct with adapted codon
usage for Escherichia coli was obtained from GeneArt
Gene Synthesis (Life Technologies GmbH, Darmstadt,
Germany). Amorphous PET ﬁlms (250lm thickness) were
purchased from Goodfellow GmbH (Bad Nauheim, Ger-
many, product number 029-198-54). FastDigest restriction
enzymes were purchased from Life Technologies GmbH.
All other chemicals were obtained from Carl Roth GmbH
+ Co. KG (Karlsruhe, Germany) and Gruessing GmbH
Analytica (Filsum, Germany) at the highest purity
available.
Cloning and expression of the polyester
hydrolase genes
The synthetic LCC gene construct without the secretion sig-
nal peptide (ENA: LN879395) was ampliﬁed using the pri-
mers LCC-FW (50-TTTTGGATCCGTCTAACCCGTACC
AGCGTG-30) and LCC-RV (50-TTTTGAATTCCCCTGG
CAGTGACGGTTGTT G-30). The gene for TfCut2 (ENA:
FR727681) without signal peptide was ampliﬁed from
T. fusca KW3 genomic DNA using the primers TfCut2-
FW (5
0-TTTTTTGGATCCGGCCAACCCCTACGAGCGC
-30) and TfCut2-RV (50-TTTTTGAATTCGGGTAGAACG
GGCAGGTGG AGC-30) (the restriction sites for BamHI
or EcoRI are underlined for each primer). The ampliﬁed
genes were digested with FastDigest BamHI and EcoRI
and ligated into theBamHI and EcoRI restriction sites of
the vector pET-20b( +). The ﬁnal pET-20b( +) construct
containing the ligated genes, pelB leader sequence, and
His6 tag was cloned intoE. coli BL21 (DE3). The expres-
sion and puriﬁcation of the recombinant hydrolases was
carried out as described previously [38]. After puriﬁcation,
the enzymes were concentrated and the buffer was changed
to 10 m
M Tris–HCl (pH 8.0 at 60°C) using Amicon Ultra
Centrifugal Filter Units (Merck KGaA, Darmstadt,
Germany).
Hydrolysis of PET ﬁlms by LCC and TfCut2
Polyethylene terephthalate ﬁlms of 9 cm2 (about 150 mg)
were added to reaction vials containing 0.1–2.8 lg/C1cm/C02 of
puriﬁed LCC or TfCut2 and 0.1–1 M Tris, sodium phos-
phate or MOPS buffer (pH 8.0) in a total volume of
1.8 mL. The pH of the buffers was adjusted at 60°C using
HCl for Tris and NaOH for MOPS buffer. The reaction
vials were incubated at 60 °C on a thermo shaker

(1000 rpm) for 1 h. Released hydrolysis products were
quantiﬁed by RP-HPLC [39]. The sum of the released sol-
uble products—TPA, mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate
(MHET), and bis-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET)
was used to determine the initial hydrolysis rate. All initial
rates were determined at least in triplicate.
Inhibition of LCC and TfCut2 by Tris and MOPS
Polyethylene terephthalate ﬁlms of 1 –9c m2 (about
20–150 mg) were added to reaction vials containing puriﬁed
LCC (1 lg) or TfCut2 (5lg) and 0.2M sodium phosphate
buffer (pH 8.0) in a total volume of 1.8 mL. Tris (0.2–
0.4 M, pH 8.0) and MOPS (0.05–0.3 M, pH 8.0) were added
to the reaction mixture. The vials were incubated at 60°C
on a thermo shaker (1000 rpm) for 1 h. Released hydroly-
sis products were quantiﬁed by RP-HPLC [39].
Molecular docking of Tris and MOPS to LCC and
TfCut2
The crystal structures of TfCut2 (PDB: 4CG1)[ 40] and
LCC (PDB: 4EB0)[ 20] were used for the docking experi-
ments with AutoDock Vina [41]. The 3D conformer struc-
tures of neutral Tris (CID 6503) [ 42] and protonated
MOPS (CID 2723950) [43] were obtained from the Open
Chemistry Database [44]. The ligand structure of a PET
model substrate (2PET) consisting of two units of the
monomer ethylene terephthalate was built with MOE
(Chemical Computing Group, Montreal, Canada). Auto-
DockTools (v1.5.6) (Molecular Graphics Laboratory,
Department of Molecular Biology, The Scripps Research
Institute, La Jolla, CA, USA) was used to prepare the ﬁles
and select the search space. PyMOL 1.1r1 [45] was used for
the visualization of the results. The main binding sites were
selected and the average binding energy was calculated.
Results
Effect of enzyme concentration and buffer
composition on the hydrolysis of PET ﬁlms by
TfCut2 and LCC
When the hydrolysis of PET ﬁlms was performed at
different concentrations of TfCut2 and LCC in Tris–
HCl, MOPS, and sodium phosphate buffers (0.2
M,
pH 8.0), the initial hydrolysis rates increased with
increasing enzyme concentrations until a maximum
was reached and then leveled off or decreased at
higher enzyme concentrations (Fig.1). The maximum
initial hydrolysis rates were reached with lower LCC
concentrations (0.1–0.3 lg/C1cm
/C02) compared to TfCut2
(0.6 lg/C1cm/C02) in all three buffers. LCC showed the
highest activity in Tris–HCl buffer (146.6lM/C1h/C01) with
a 2.1-fold higher rate than TfCut2 (Fig.1A). In 0.2M
MOPS and sodium phosphate, both enzymes did not
signiﬁcantly differ in their maximum hydrolysis rates
(40–60 l
M/C1h/C01) (Fig.1B,C).
Effect of buffer concentrations on the hydrolysis
of PET ﬁlms by TfCut2 and LCC
The effect of the buffer concentration on the hydroly-
sis rate of LCC and TfCut2 against PET ﬁlms is
shown in Fig. 2. LCC and TfCut2 were employed in
concentrations corresponding to their maximum initial
hydrolysis rates (see Fig. 1). The activity of TfCut2
and LCC depended on the concentration of the buf-
fers. The activity of TfCut2 in MOPS buffer was low
in the range from 0.1 to 1

J. Schmidt et al. Effect of buffers on polyester hydrolases
activity decreased by 80% compared to 0.1M Tris buf-
fer. In contrast, the hydrolysis rate was about 10-fold
higher at 1 M sodium phosphate compared to 0.1 M.
LCC showed a different response to changing buffer
concentrations. While the hydrolysis rates were unaf-
fected within 0.1–1
M of the phosphate buffer, in 1M
Tris and MOPS buffers its activity decreased by more
than 90% compared to 0.1M.
Inhibition of the hydrolysis of PET by LCC and
TfCut2 in the presence of Tris and MOPS
The low hydrolysis rates detected with Tris and MOPS
buffers suggested an inhibitory effect on the hydrolysis
of PET by LCC and TfCut2. The inhibitory effect of
the buffers was investigated by performing the hydrol-
ysis reaction in 0.2
M sodium phosphate buffer (pH
8.0) containing 0.2 and 0.4M of Tris for both enzymes
or 0.1 and 0.3M of MOPS for LCC. Since the hydrol-
ysis rates of PET by TfCut2 at MOPS concentrations
of 0.1–1
M were very low, buffer concentrations in the
range from 0.05–0.075 M were used. LCC and TfCut2
were employed in concentrations corresponding to
their maximum initial hydrolysis rates (see Fig.1).
The Lineweaver–Burk plots indicated an inhibition
of both enzymes by Tris and MOPS (Figs3 and 4).
All curves showed common intercepts located mainly
in the ﬁrst square of the plots suggesting a competitive
type of inhibition of LCC and TfCut2 by Tris and
MOPS. A similar result has been reported previously
indicating a competitive inhibition of TfCut2 by the
PET hydrolysis products MHET and BHET [39].
The corresponding K
i values (Table1) for both buf-
fers were determined by replotting the slopes calculated
from the Lineweaver–Burk plots against the concentra-
tion of Tris and MOPS [46,47]. The results showed that
MOPS is the stronger inhibitor of both enzymes with
signiﬁcantly lowerK
i values compared to Tris.
Molecular docking of Tris and MOPS
The molecular docking experiments performed for
LCC and TfCut2 with the two inhibitors, Tris and
MOPS, revealed several binding sites on the surface of
the two enzymes. An interaction of the inhibitors with
speciﬁc amino acid residues could not be conﬁrmed

(Fig. 5). The main binding site of Tris and MOPS was
detected near the catalytic triad inside the substrate-
binding groove at the surface of LCC and TfCut2 [48].
A second minor binding site of Tris was located next
to the substrate-binding pocket of LCC (Fig.5A). This
site is assumed to be inside an extended region of the
substrate-binding pocket of LCC when compared to
the substrate-binding regions of the polyester hydro-
lases from Thermobiﬁda cellulosilytica DSM44535 [16].
A similar minor binding site of MOPS was observed
in TfCut2 (Fig. 5D). The docking experiments with
Tris were carried out in its protonated and neutral
state since both are present at pH 8.0. The same bind-
ing areas were obtained for both states and only the
results of neutral Tris are shown in Fig.5.
A determination of the average binding energies
showed for MOPS /C03.7 kcal/C1mol
/C01 bound to LCC
and /C03.5 kcal/C1mol/C01 bound to TfCut2. For Tris,
/C03.1 kcal/C1mol/C01 were obtained bound to LCC and
/C02.8 kcal/C1mol/C01 bound to TfCut2. The average bind-
ing energies indicated a higher afﬁnity of MOPS for
both enzymes and conﬁrmed the lower Ki values of
MOPS (Table1).
Discussion
In this study, the effect of MOPS, Tris and sodium
phosphate buffers on the enzymatic activity of the
polyester hydrolases LCC and TfCut2 was investi-
gated. The determination of the initial hydrolysis rates
showed that maximum values were obtained at lower
concentrations of LCC than of TfCut2 indicating a
higher activity of LCC against the PET ﬁlm. In 0.2
M
Tris LCC showed a 2.1-fold higher maximum initial
hydrolysis rate than TfCut2. In contrast, both enzymes
revealed no signiﬁcant difference in their maximum
hydrolysis rates in 0.2
M MOPS or sodium phosphate
buffer. At increasing concentrations of Tris and MOPS
buffer, the initial PET hydrolysis rates decreased or
were constantly low for LCC and TfCut2. An inverse
effect was observed with sodium phosphate buffer.
TfCut2 showed an increased initial hydrolysis rate with
increasing sodium phosphate concentrations while
LCC showed constantly high initial hydrolysis rates at
all tested concentrations. The kosmotropic phosphate
anions possibly stabilized LCC and TfCut2 resulting
in higher hydrolysis rates of the PET ﬁlms. The precip-
itating (salting out) and solubilizing (salting in) proper-
ties of anions have been explained by different water
adsorbing effects of salts [21]. Ions are thereby classi-
ﬁed according to their ability to form or break water
structures. Kosmotropic (precipitating) ions stabilize
proteins and support the formation of polar water
structures, whereas chaotropic (solubilizing) ions break
the water structures and destabilize proteins [49–52].
Such a stabilizing effect has been reported previously
for a tetrameric maize leaf phosphoenolpyruvate car-
boyxlase [53]. The authors suggested that kosmotropic
anions such as HPO
2/C0
4 stabilized the enzyme most
effectively by their water-structuring effects and by
increasing the surface tension. The observed stabilizing
effect also depended on the concentration of the kos-
motropic salts. HPO
2/C0
4 signiﬁcantly improved the sta-
bility and activity of an endoxylanase fromBacillus sp.
[54]. By increasing the concentration of K2HPO4,a n
increased Tm value and an increase in xylanase activity
was observed. The authors suggested that the activity
increase and the stabilization of the enzyme by
K
2HPO4 was due to a conformational change caused
by the phosphate anion. Supporting these ﬁndings, an
activating effect of sodium phosphate buffer was also
observed for LCC and TfCut2 (Fig.2C).

J. Schmidt et al. Effect of buffers on polyester hydrolases
While TfCut2 showed the highest initial hydrolysis
rate in sodium phosphate buffer at a concentration of
> 0.7
M, the hydrolysis rate of LCC was independent
from the concentration of the sodium phosphate buffer
in a range from 0.1 to 1
M. Since TPA is released dur-
ing the hydrolysis of PET, a buffer of high molarity or
strength is required to maintain the pH of the reaction
medium [55]. The ionic strength of the buffer has been
shown previously to inﬂuence the hydrolysis of PET
ﬁlms by TfCut2 in an ultraﬁltration membrane reactor
[25]. The enzyme showed a 3.8-fold higher initial
hydrolysis rate in 0.5
M Na2HPO4 than in 0.5 M Tris
buffer. Conﬁrming our results, the highest hydrolysis
rate was also obtained at a sodium phosphate concen-
tration of 0.7
M. The effect of the Na2HPO4 buffer on
the hydrolytic activity of TfCut2 was attributed to the
high ionic strength of the buffer [25]. At 0.5
M, the
Na2HPO4 buffer has an ionic strength of 3M, while
the ionic strength of Tris buffer with this concentra-
tion is 0.07
M. When the ionic strength of Tris buffer
was increased to 2M, a 2.4-fold higher hydrolysis rate
of TfCut2 was observed.
In contrast to sodium phosphate buffer, higher con-
centrations of Tris and MOPS resulted in a reduction
of the hydrolytic activity of LCC and TfCu2 against
PET suggesting an inhibitory effect of the buffers
(Fig. 2A,B). The double reciprocal plots suggested a
competitive inhibition. A comparison of theK
i values
indicated MOPS as a stronger inhibitor for both
enzymes (Table 1). When comparing the initial hydrol-
ysis rates of PET ﬁlms by TfCut2 and LCC in 0.1–1 M
Tris and MOPS buffers, MOPS also caused a decrease
in the hydrolysis rates at lower concentrations than
Tris (Fig. 2). An inhibition of cholinesterases by Tris
has been already reported in the 1960s [ 29]. The
authors showed a competitive inhibition by Tris with
inhibition constants of 13–14 m
M. A competitive inhi-
bition of an a-amylase from Bacillus licheniformis by
Tris with a Ki of 13.12 mM has also been reported
[46]. Accompanying docking studies indicated a high
binding potential of Tris at the active site of the
enzyme. The catalytic residues Asp 174 and Glu 200
of a psychrophilic a-amylase from Alteromonas halo-
planctis also showed a strong interaction with the
amino group of Tris [56]. In addition, the hydroxyl
groups of Tris were found to form hydrogen bonds
with the three catalytic amino acids of the enzyme.
The K
i values obtained in this study for the inhibition
of LCC and TfCut2 by Tris (Table1) are higher than
those described in other reports before, suggesting a
weaker inhibiting effect than for other enzymes.
Only few reports are available about an inhibitory
effect of MOPS on enzyme activity. MOPS has been
shown to reduce the activity of bovine adrenal tyrosine
hydroxylase by 40% [36]. A metallo-b-lactamase from
Bacteroides fragilis was inhibited by MES which is
similar to MOPS a sulfonic acid buffer [37]. The crys-
tal structure of a complex of the enzyme with MES

suggested an interaction of MES with the active site of
the enzyme and a competitive inhibition by MES with
a Ki of 23/C65m M was observed.
The molecular docking experiments performed in
this study indicated that both Tris and MOPS did not
bind speciﬁcally to TfCut2 and LCC. The main bind-
ing sites of Tris and MOPS were located near the cat-
alytic triad inside the substrate-binding groove at the
surface of the two enzymes. A second minor binding
site of Tris inside an extended region of the substrate-
binding pocket was present in LCC. TfCut2 showed a
similar second minor binding area for MOPS. Both
areas were located in a long groove at the surface of
the enzymes. This groove has been proposed to play a
crucial role in the recognition and accommodation of
polymeric substrates by the highly homologous polye-
ster hydrolase Est119 from Thermobibiﬁda alba
AHK119 [48]. The interaction of Tris and MOPS with
this groove in LCC and TfCut2 could prevent the
binding of the polymeric PET substrate resulting in an
inhibition of their hydrolytic activity against PET in
an apparently competitive manner. A speciﬁc interac-
tion with amino acids of the groove could, however,
not be detected, conﬁrming the weak inhibition indi-
cated by highK
i values for Tris and MOPS. With both
enzymes, the average binding energy was 2- and 0.5-
fold lower for Tris and MOPS, respectively, compared
to the average binding energy for the PET model com-
pound 2PET [40], suggesting a more favorable interac-
tion with the model substrate (data not shown).
In conclusion, the activity of the polyester hydro-
lases LCC and TfCut2 against PET ﬁlms was shown
to strongly depend on the type and concentration of
the buffer. A buffer of high molarity and strength was
required to stabilize the pH during the reaction. High
initial hydrolysis rates were obtained using sodium
phosphate buffer at concentrations > 0.7
M. In con-
trast, the hydrolytic activity of both enzymes was
inhibited at higher concentrations of MOPS and Tris.
