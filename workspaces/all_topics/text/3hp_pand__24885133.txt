Abstract
Background: 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3HP) is an important chemical precursor for the production of bioplastics.
Microbial production of 3HP from glycerol has previously been developed through the optimization of culture
conditions and the 3HP biosynthesis pathway. In this study, a novel strategy for improving 3HP production in
Escherichia coli was investigated by the modification of central metabolism based on a genome-scale metabolic
model and experimental validation.
Results: Metabolic simulation identified the double knockout oftpiA and zwf as a candidate for improving 3HP
production. A 3HP-producing strain was constructed by the expression of glycerol dehydratase and aldehyde
dehydrogenase. The double knockout oftpiA and zwf increased the percentage carbon-molar yield (C-mol%) of
3HP on consumed glycerol 4.4-fold (20.1 ± 9.2 C-mol%), compared to the parental strain. Increased extracellular
methylglyoxal concentrations in theΔtpiA Δzwf strain indicated that glycerol catabolism was occurring through the
methylglyoxal pathway, which converts dihydroxyacetone phosphate to pyruvate, as predicted by the metabolic
model. Since theΔtpiA Δzwf strain produced abundant 1,3-propanediol as a major byproduct (37.7 ± 13.2 C-mol%),
yqhD, which encodes an enzyme involved in the production of 1,3-propanediol, was disrupted in theΔtpiA Δzwf
strain. The 3HP yield of theΔtpiA Δzwf ΔyqhD strain (33.9 ± 1.2 C-mol%) was increased 1.7-fold further compared to
the ΔtpiA Δzwf strain and by 7.4-fold compared to the parental strain.
Conclusion: This study successfully increased 3HP production by 7.4-fold in theΔtpiA Δzwf ΔyqhD E. colistrain by
the modification of the central metabolism, based on metabolic simulation and experimental validation of
engineered strains.

Background
3-hydroxypropionic acid (3HP) has recently attracted
attention due to its availability as a precursor of valuable
chemicals such as acrylic acid, β-propiolactone, and
malonic acid [1,2]. Its polymerized form, poly(3HP), is a
promising alternative to petrochemical-derived plastic
[3,4]. Because of this superior industrial availability, 3HP
was designated as one of the top value-added chemicals
produced by biomass, by the U.S. Department of Energy
[5,6]. In the commercial bioproduction process, the
substrate has a significant impact on production cost.
Glycerol is a potential substrate for bioproduction
considering that the recent expansion of biodiesel
production has caused a surplus of glycerol as its
byproduct, and a subsequent decrease in the price of
glycerol [7-9].
The microbial production of 3HP from glycerol has
been developed using a natural 3HP producer,Klebsiella
pneumoniae [10-13]. Expression of the heterologous
glycerol dehydratase and aldehyde dehydrogenase enabled
3HP to be produced in the non-natural 3HP producers
Pseudomonas denitrificans [14,15] and Escherichia coli

[16-19]. To date, various studies have reported increased
3HP production [10-19]. For example, Rathnasingh et al.
optimized the expression level of each enzyme in this
pathway in E. coli [17]. Ashok et al. deleted dhaT and
yqhD to reduce the production of byproducts in K.
pneumoniae [12]. Kim et al. modified glycerol metabolism
in 3HP-producing E. coli and developed fed-batch
cultivation with simultaneous feeding of glycerol and
glucose [19]. As described above, most previous studies
focused on the optimization of metabolic reactions from
glycerol to 3HP and culture conditions. Considering the
whole metabolic network, modification of other pathways,
as well as the biosynthetic pathway of the target product,
is also a key strategy for increasing the metabolic flux,
leading to enhanced target production. For example,
target production can be enhanced by improving the
redox balance and reducing byproduct formation via gene
knockout and overexpression [12,20].
Recently, in silico metabolic simulation has been
developed to consider whole metabolic networks. A
genome-scale metabolic model, which includes most of
the metabolic reactions of the cell [21-23], can estimate
the flux distribution of the whole metabolic network
using flux balance analysis (FBA) [24,25] by assuming
the steady states of metabolic reactions and maximizing
objective functions such as cell growth [26,27]. This
method can be used to simulate the effects of gene
modifications on target production and identify candidate
genes for metabolic engineering [28-30]. Successful
improvements in target production have been reported in
many such simulations [31-33].
The introduction of heterologous genes and gene
manipulations does not always produce the expected
growth behavior and target production in engineered
strains. Experimental validation of engineered strains
provides useful information about the actual metabolic
state of a cell such as bottleneck reactions, growth
inhibition factors, and redox imbalance [34-36]. A
strain engineered on the basis of metabolic simulation
should be evaluated experimentally to develop the
next strategy for improving target production.
The current study aimed to enhance 3HP production
from glycerol in E. coli by focusing on the whole
metabolic network. Metabolic pathway modification
was designed by integrating in silico gene-knockout
simulation with the experimental validation of engineered
strains. The genome-scale metabolic model ofE. coli was
used to design a metabolic network for increased 3HP
production. Metabolic simulation identified two candidate
genes to be deleted,tpiA and zwf, which are involved in
central metabolism. Based on the simulation, knockout
strains were constructed and 3HP production was
successfully increased, as predicted. In addition, a gene,
yqhD, related to the biosynthesis pathway of a major
byproduct, 1,3-propanediol (1,3-PDO), was deleted to
further increase 3HP production.
Results and discussion
Construction of a 3HP-producing strain in E. coli
The 3HP biosynthetic pathway from glycerol consists
of two reactions: the dehydration of glycerol to 3-
hydroxypropionaldehyde (3 HPA), catalyzed by glycerol
dehydratase, and the oxidation of 3HPA to 3HP , catalyzed
by aldehyde dehydrogenase [16]. Since E. coli does not
possess the 3HP biosynthetic pathway, the 3HP-producing
strain (TK52) was constructed by the overexpression of
dhaB and gdrAB, which encode for glycerol dehydratase
and glycerol dehydratase reactivase (fromK. pneumoniae),
respectively, and aldH, which encodes for aldehyde de-
hydrogenase (from E. coli), as described in a previous
study [17]. TK52 was cultivated in M9 medium in a
Sakaguchi flask and 3HP was produced at 4.6 ± 0.8%
carbon-molar yield of 3HP on consumed glycerol (C-mol%)
(Figure 1A–B and Table 1). Acetate was produced as a
major byproduct (9.9 ± 1.8 C-mol%) and small yields of
1,3-PDO (0.8 ± 0.4 C-mol%) and succinate (0.9 ± 0.1
C-mol%) were also produced. Ethanol and formate
were not detected in this strain and other strains that were
constructed. Although E. coli does not possess 1,3-PDO
biosynthetic pathways, the introduction ofdhaB for 3HP
production enabled production of 1,3-PDO as follows:
glycerol dehydratase converts glycerol to 3HPA, and an
endogenous alcohol dehydrogenase (encoded for byyqhD)
further converts 3HPA to 1,3-PDO [13,32].
Gene knockout simulation for 3HP production
Metabolic simulation was carried out to improve 3HP
production by considering the whole metabolic network.
A genome-scale metabolic model of E. coli, iAF1260,
which includes 2,077 metabolic and transport reactions
and 1,038 unique metabolites [21], was employed with
FBA [24,25] to simulate 3HP production inE. coli.S i n c e
the 3HP biosynthesis pathway does not exist inE. coli,
seven reactions involved in the 3HP biosynthetic pathway
were added to the iAF1260 model (Table 2), which was
subsequently referred to as the iAF1260-3HP model.
Using the iAF1260-3HP model, multiple gene knockout
simulations were performed to identify candidate genes
that could enhance 3HP production when deleted. For
simulation parameters, glycerol was used as the sole
carbon source, and its uptake rate (GUR) was set to
15 mmol/(g dry cell (DC)●h). The oxygen uptake rate
(OUR) was set to 10 mmol/(g DC●h), which corresponds
to a microaerobic condition.
In single-gene knockout simulations, solutions in
which the metabolic flux of 3HP production was higher
than zero were not obtained. Double-gene knockout
simulations identified some candidate genes that when

deleted together could enhance 3HP production (Table 3).
Among these, ΔtpiA Δpgi, ΔtpiA Δzwf,a n dΔtpiA Δedd
models displayed the highest carbon-mol yield of 3HP on
glycerol (70.5 C-mol%). In this study, we focused on the
double knockout oftpiA and zwf for further analysis.tpiA
encodes for triosephosphate isomerase, which converts
dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) to glyceraldehyde-
3-phosphate (GAP).zwf codes for glucose-6-phosphate-1-
dehydrogenase, which converts glucose-6-phosphate to
6-phospho-glucono-1,5-lactone.
The simulated flux distributions of the iAF1260-3HP ,
ΔtpiA, Δzwf, and ΔtpiA Δzwf models are shown in
Figure 2. In the iAF1260-3HP model, a high flux of
glycolysis was predicted and ATP required for cell growth
was mainly produced by glycolysis and the respiratory
chain (Figure 2A). The Δzwf model exhibited the
same flux distribution as the iAF1260-3HP model
(Figure 2B) because the flux of the glucose-6-phosphate-
1-dehydrogenase reaction was zero in the iAF1260-3HP
model (Figure 2A). In the ΔtpiA model, glycerol was
mainly catabolized through the Entner-Doudoroff pathway
via dihydroxyacetone (DHA) and entered into gluconeogen-
esis and the TCA cycle. The flux into glycolysis was blocked
by the inability to generate GAP from DHAP because the
amount of GAP consumed by the fructose 6-phosphate
aldolase reaction, which converts DHA and GAP to
fructose 6-phosphate, was equal to the amount of GAP
produced by the Entner-Doudoroff pathway (Figure 2C).
In the ΔtpiA Δzwf model, the zwf knockout blocked
flux into the Entner-Doudoroff pathway, which was
active in the ΔtpiA model. This resulted in glycerol
catabolism through the glycerol kinase reaction, which
converts glycerol to glycerol-3-phosphate, and the
methylglyoxal pathway, in which DHAP is converted to
pyruvate via methylglyoxal. 3HP was produced instead
of acetate in theΔtpiA Δzwf model. In theΔtpiA model,
acetate production was preferred since ATP was also
generated. However, in theΔtpiA Δzwf model, ATP was
consumed by the glycerol kinase reaction, which is why
total ATP was not generated by acetate production from
glycerol. When the OUR was limited, 3HP production
was increased, instead of acetate production, to balance
the reduced capacity of the respiratory chain due to the
reduction in NADH generation by 3HP production from
glycerol (Figure 2D).
3HP production based on the metabolic simulation
Based on the results from the metabolic simulation, both
tpiA and zwf were disrupted in the TK52 strain, generating
strain TK52tz. The 3HP yield of TK52tz was successfully
increased 4.4-fold relative to TK52 (20.1 ± 9.2 C-mol%)
(Figure 1G-H and Table 1). TK52tz exhibited a two-step
growth phase that was not observed in TK52, with specific
growth rates of 0.54 1/h in the first growth phase (0–6h )
and 0.03 1/h in the second growth phase (48–72 h). 3HP
was mainly produced in the second growth phase with the
consumption of acetate and lactate that was produced
prior to the second growth phase. The growth rate of
TK52tz was decreased compared to TK52 (0.73 1/h), and
glycerol was not completely consumed in TK52tz. Acetate
and 1,3-PDO were produced as byproducts. Although
1,3-PDO production was not predicted by metabolic
simulation, the experimental results of TK52tz were
consistent with the simulation results, including the
improvement in 3HP yield, the decrease in growth rate,
and the lack of succinate production. This indicated that
metabolic modeling is an effective strategy for the
improvement of target production.
Based on the metabolic simulation, glycerol was predicted
to be catabolized in TK52tz through the methylglyoxal
pathway, which converts DHAP to pyruvate. This pathway
is not usually active inE. colidue to allosteric inhibition by

inorganic pyrophosphate and the low activity of enzymes
involved in this pathway [37,38]. The extracellular concen-
tration of methylglyoxal, an intermediate of the pathway,
was increased significantly in TK52tz (0.22 mM at
maximum) compared with TK52 (0.03 mM at maximum).
This suggested that flux into the methylglyoxal pathway
was increased as predicted, and this pathway might be a
bottleneck for glycerol catabolism. This could result in
decreased growth and incomplete glycerol consumption
because methylglyoxal is a toxic cellular electrophile that
reacts with the nucleophilic centers of macromolecules
such as DNA, RNA, and protein [39].
Abundant production of 1,3-PDO was observed as a
primary byproduct (37.7 ± 13.2 C-mol%) in TK52tz.
Increased 3HP production might lead to the accumulation
of intracellular 3HPA, a precursor of 3HP as well as
1,3-PDO, and result in the overflow of flux toward
1,3-PDO production. We speculated that changing the
aldehyde dehydrogenase to the superior enzyme [17],
or disruption ofyqhD, whose product converts 3HPA to
1,3-PDO, would increase 3HP production and decrease
1,3-PDO production.

effects of the knockout of each gene. Metabolic simula-
tion predicted that the zwf knockout would not affect
metabolism, but the tpiA knockout would alter
metabolic flux into the Entner-Doudoroff pathway
and decrease the growth rate. Similar culture results
between TK52z and TK52 (Figure 1A –1D, Table 1)
suggest that the flux into the oxidative pentose
phosphate pathway was small, and the deletion of
zwf had a small impact on metabolism in this condition,
as predicted by the simulation. The culture results of
TK52t and TK52tz were similar (Figure 1E-1H, Table 1).
The 3HP yield of TK52t was increased by 3.2-fold relative
to TK52 (14.7 ± 7.0 C-mol%) and slightly reduced
when compared to TK52tz. TK52t produced 1,3-PDO
(22.9 ± 5.2 C-mol%) as a byproduct, as predicted by
metabolic simulation. Acetate production by the tpiA
knockout was also predicted, however measurements
of acetate production (8.2 ± 9.9 C-mol%) in TK52t
contained significant variation, thus it was difficult to
compare the experimental results with the results
from the metabolic simulation.
The increased 3HP yield in thetpiA knockout, which
was not predicted by metabolic simulation, might be due
to the conversion of glycerol to glycerol 3-phosphate by
glycerol kinase, which may have had a higher activity
than the glycerol dehydrogenase that converts glycerol
to DHA [40]. This would lead to increased flux into
the methylglyoxal pathway, as indicated by elevated
methylglyoxal levels (Figure 1F), resulting in similar
culture results for TK52tz (Figure 1H), such as 3HP
production.
Further increase in 3HP production by yqhD deletion,
based on measurement of 1,3-PDO production
3HP production was successfully increased in TK52tz,
however a high yield of 1,3-PDO was also produced
(37.7 ± 13.2 C-mol%).yqhD, which is involved in 1,3-PDO
biosynthesis, was deleted in TK52tz, generating the strain
TK52tzy, in order to decrease1,3-PDO production and fur-
ther increase 3HP production. As a result, the 3HP yield of
TK52tzy was increased 1.7-fold (33.9 ± 1.2 C-mol%) and the
1,3-PDO yield was drastically reduced (5.9 ± 0.5 C-mol%)
relative to TK52tz (Figure 1I-J, Table 1). Compared to the
parental strain, a 7.4-fold increase in 3HP yield was
achieved in TK52tzy. Despite the deletion of yqhD,
1,3-PDO was still produced in TK52tzy (5.9 ± 0.5 C-mol%),
likely due to the presence of other alcohol dehydrogenases
that might convert 3HPA to 1,3-PDO. The deletion of
yqhD increased the maximum concentration of extracellu-
lar methylglyoxal in TK52tzy (0.60 mM at maximum)
relative to TK52tz (0.22 mM at maximum), since YqhD
also utilizes methylglyoxal as a substrate [41]. The other
culture results of TK52tzy, such as consumed glycerol and
biomass yield, were similar to those of TK52tz (Table 1).
The culture results of TK52t and TK52tz revealed large
variations in the production of 3HP , 1,3-PDO, and acetate
and the consumption of glycerol (Figure 1E-H). On
the other hand, the results from TK52tzy displayed
smaller variations in these measurements (Figure 1I-J).
Furthermore, TK52t and TK52tz produced a large amount
of 1,3-PDO, which accompanies NADPH oxidation. The
deletion of yqhD in TK52tz decreased the magnitude of
the error, suggesting that the high production of 1,3-PDO
in TK52t and TK52tz might cause redox imbalance,
resulting in the large variations in the measurements.
The 3HP yield of TK52tzy (33.9 ± 1.2 C-mol%) was
comparable to previous studies producing 3HP from
glycerol via flask cultivation. Mohan et al. achieved 3HP
yield of 39.0 ± 0.01 C-mol% by the optimization of
culture conditions such as the initial culture medium
pH [18]. Rathnasingh et al. achieved a yield of 40 C-mol%
by the expression of α-ketoglutaric semialdehyde
dehydrogenase instead of aldehyde dehydrogenase, and
periodic supplementation with vitamin B
12, a coenzyme
for glycerol dehydratase [17]. Jung et al. constructed an
engineered E. coli strain by knocking outackA, pta,a n d
yqhD to reduce byproduct generation and knocking out
glpR and overexpressing glpF to enhance glycerol
metabolism [42]. They achieved high 3HP production
(42 g/L) by fed-batch cultivation using a jar fermenter, but
the 3HP yield was lower (26.2 C-mol%) than that achieved
in this study. In previous studies [17,18], acetate was a
major byproduct, as it was in this study, and higher yields
of succinate, lactate, and ethanol were also produced.
Succinate, lactate, and ethanol production might serve
to oxidize the excess NADH that accompanies 3HP
production and glycerol catabolism via glycolysis,
since production of these metabolites requires NADH as a
reducing agent. Conversely, the yields of these metabolites
were small in TK52tzy. This might be because the deletion
of tpiA and zwf prevented flux into glycolysis, reducing
excess NADH production, as predicted by metabolic
simulation.
In this study, metabolic simulation was performed under
the conditions of OUR/GUR = 0.67 (OUR = 10 mmol/
(g DC●h) and GUR = 15 mmol/(g DC●h)), and additional
simulations were also performed under other various
OUR/GUR conditions (data not shown). Given the 3HP
yield of TK52tzy (33.9 ± 1.2 C-mol%), the metabolic
state of the cell in this study was estimated under the
condition of OUR/GUR≈ 1, by the metabolic simulation.
Although the adjustment of oxygen supply to the
simulation result was difficult using flask cultivation
(oxygen transfer coefficient, k
La, of a shaking flask is
10–100 1/h), the metabolic simulation was used effectively
for improving 3HP production. Further increases in 3HP
production can be expected by the optimization of
aeration conditions using a bioreactor.

Metabolic simulation is a powerful tool for the design
of metabolic engineering strategies to improve target
production and has been used successfully in many
studies. Metabolic simulation using FBA is simply
based on the assumption of steady state metabolism
without considering the complex cellular mechanisms
such as enzyme activity and regulation. This can cause
discrepancies between the simulation and experimental
results, i.e., the unpredicted production of 1,3-PDO in the
present study. Thus, examination of the differences
between experimental and simulation results, and
conformation of the constructed strains to the simulated
metabolic state, is important for further improvement of
target production.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the production of 3HP from glycerol
in E. coli was improved by the modification of central
metabolism, based on metabolic simulation and
experimental validation of the engineered strains. Gene
knockout simulations using the genome-scale metabolic
model identifiedtpiA and zwf as candidates to be modified
and in this double knockout strain, TK52tz, 3HP yield was
increased 4.4-fold relative to the TK52 parent strain, as
predicted. Increased extracellular methylglyoxal in
TK52tz suggested that glycerol catabolism through
the methylglyoxal pathway was consistent with metabolic
simulation. Since TK52tz produced 1,3-PDO as an
abundant byproduct, yqhD, which encodes an enzyme
involved in 1,3-PDO production, was deleted in TK52tz.
The resulting strain, TK52tzy, exhibited a 1.7-fold increase
in 3HP yield relative to TK52tz and a 7.4-fold increase
(33.9 ± 1.2 C-mol%) relative to TK52. The double knockout
of tpiA and zwf contributed to the reduced production of
byproducts such as succinate and lactate that are associated
with NADH oxidation, likely due to reduced NADH
production by the inhibition of glycolysis. The successful
increase in 3HP production, based on metabolic simulation,
demonstrated the effectiveness of metabolic modeling in
designing a metabolic engineering strategy. Moreover,
experimental validation of the engineered strains and
comparison with the simulation results provided additional
modifications to the engineering strategy to increase target
production.

Medium and culture methods
Pre-cultures were grown aerobically at 37°C overnight in
Lennox medium (10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast extract,
5 g/L NaCl, 1 g/L glucose) containing 0.05 g/L ampicillin
and 0.05 g/L streptomycin. Pre-cultures were transferred
to the main culture with an initial optical density at
600 nm (OD
600) of 0.02. For the main culture, M9
medium (17.1 g/L Na2HPO4･12H2O, 3.0 g/L KH2PO4,
2.0 g/L NH4Cl, 0.5 g/L NaCl, 0.123 g/L MgSO4･7H2O,
0.00278 g/L FeSO 4･7H2O, 0.0147 g/L CaCl 2･2H2O,
0.01 g/L thiamine HCl) supplemented with 2 g/L yeast
extract, 0.02 mM cyanocobalamin, 0.1 mM IPTG, 0.05 g/L
ampicillin, and 0.05 g/L streptomycin was used. Cells were
cultured in 500 mL Sakaguchi flasks containing 50 mL of
the M9 medium at 37°C in a shaking incubator at 120 rpm
(MM-10, Taitec, Saitama, Japan).
Analytical methods
Cell growth was monitored by the measurement of
OD
600 using UV-mini 1240 (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan).
Concentrations of glycerol, 3HP , 1,3-PDO, succinate,
lactate, acetate, formate, and ethanol present in the
supernatant of the culture broth were determined by an
HPLC system (HPLC Prominence, Shimadzu) equipped
with an Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA, U.S.A.), a UV/vis detector (SPD-20A), and a refractive
index detector (RID-10A). The column temperature was
set to 65°C, and 2 mM H
2SO4 was used as the mobile
phase with a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min. The flow cell
temperature of the refractive index detector was set
to 35°C. The supernatant of the culture broth was obtained
by centrifugation at 21,500 ×g for 5 min at 4°C, and then
filtered through a Millex HV 0.45-μmf i l t e r( M e r c kK G a A ) .
Methylglyoxal in the supernatant was quantified colori-
metrically with 2,4-dinitrop henylhydrazine (2,4-DNPH)
[47]. The reaction mixture containing 67μLo fs a m p l ea n d
22 μL of 2,4-DNPH solution (0.1% 2,4-DNPH in 2 M HCl)
was incubated for 15 min at 30°C in a 96-well microtiter
plate, and then 111μL of 10% NaOH was added. After a
15-min incubation at room temperature, the absorbance
at 544 nm was measured with a microplate reader (1420
ARVO, PerkinElmer Inc., Waltham, MA, U.S.A.).
In silico metabolic simulation
The genome-scale metabolic model ofE. coliK-12, named
iAF1260 [21], was used. iAF1260 contains 1,260 ORFs,
2,077 metabolic and transport reactions, and 1,038 unique
metabolites. To simulate 3HP production byE. coli, seven
reactions required for 3HP biosynthesis from glycerol
were added to the iAF1260 model (Table 2), because
neither the iAF1260 model nor the wildtypeE. coli con-
tained the 3HP biosynthesis pathway. The 3HP transport
reaction was also added to the metabolic model as a pro-
ton symporter because the transport of a similar metabol-
ite, D-lactate (2-hydroxypropionic acid), occurs through a
proton symporter in the iAF1260 model. In the same
manner, the 1,3-PDO transport reaction was added as
a diffusion reaction, which is considered to utilize the
1,2-propandiol transporter in the iAF1260 model.
FBA was used to simulate the metabolic flux distribu-
tion in the genome-scale metabolic model [24,25].
Briefly, a pseudo-steady state of the metabolite profile
was assumed, and the maximum and minimum ranges
of the flux for each reaction were defined. These con-
straints provided a feasible space for the flux distribution
in the metabolic model. To obtain an optimal flux distri-
bution in the feasible space, an objective function was
introduced and a linear programming technique was
applied. This problem is represented by the following
equation:
maximize : c
T ⋅v
subject to: ⋅S⋅v ¼ 0
vmin≤v≤vmax
where S represents the stoichiometric matrix of metabolites
in metabolic reactions, andv indicates a vector of flux for
each metabolic reaction. The valuesvmin and vmax represent
Tokuyama et al. Microbial Cell Factories2014, 13:64 Page 9 of 11
http://www.microbialcellfactories.com/content/13/1/64
the minimum and maximum constraints of flux for each
reaction, and c is a vector that represents the objective
function to be maximized or minimized. In this study,
biomass production was used as the objective function
to be maximized, with the assumption that cellular
metabolism is self-organized to maximize growth rate.
After the maximal biomass production flux was obtained,
the 3HP production flux was maximized under the fixed
biomass production flux, on the maximal value, to avoid
undetermined 3HP production flux [29].
For metabolic simulation, glycerol was used as the
sole carbon source, and the uptake rate was set to
15 mmol/(g DC ●h). The oxygen uptake rate was set
to 10 mmol/(g DC●h). Other external metabolites such as
CO
2 and NH3 were allowed to transport freely through
the cell membrane. For gene knockout simulations,
minimum and maximum fluxes of the corresponding
reactions were set to zero. All simulations were performed
using Matlab (MathWorks Inc., Natick, MA, U.S.A.) with
a solver for linear programming, GLPK (GNU Linear
Programming Kit, http://glpkmex.sourceforge.net/).
