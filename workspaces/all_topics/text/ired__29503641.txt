Argimycins P are a recently identiﬁed family of polyketide alkaloids encoded by the
cryptic gene cluster arp of Streptomyces argillaceus. These compounds contain either
a piperideine ring, or a piperidine ring which may be fused to a ﬁve membered ring, and
a polyene side chain, which is bound in some cases to an N-acetylcysteine moiety. The
arp cluster consists of 11 genes coding for structural proteins, two for regulatory proteins
and one for a hypothetical protein. Herein, we have characterized the post-piperideine
ring biosynthesis steps of argimycins P through the generation of mutants inarp genes,
the identiﬁcation and characterization of compounds accumulated by those mutants,
and cross-feeding experiments between mutants. Based in these results, a biosynthesis
pathway is proposed assigning roles to every arp gene product. The regulation of the
arp cluster is also addressed by inactivating/overexpressing the positive SARP-likearpRI
and the negative TetR-likearpRII transcriptional regulators and determining the effect on
argimycins P production, and through gene expression analyses (reverse transcription
PCR and quantitative real-time PCR) of arp genes in regulatory mutants in comparison
to the wild type strain. These ﬁndings will contribute to deepen the knowledge on the
biosynthesis of piperidine-containing polyketides and provide tools that can be used to
generate new analogs by genetic engineering and/or biocatalysis.

INTRODUCTION
Alkaloids are a group of natural products synthesized by plants, animals, and microorganisms that
show a broad structural diversity and the presence of a basic nitrogen atom as a common feature
(Cushnie et al., 2014; Sigrist et al., 2015). This family of compounds shows signiﬁcant bioactivity,
in some cases beneﬁcial (antimalarial, antitumor, antiasthma, antihypertensive, anti-arrhythmic,
analgesic), but in others harmful for humans and animals (Cushnie et al., 2014; Sigrist et al., 2015).
In addition, they seem to play diﬀerent roles in producer organisms. In microorganisms, alkaloids
have been involved in growth and colony development, self-defense or as autoinducers (Heeb et al.,
2011; Cushnie et al., 2014; Ye et al., 2017). Attending to the chemical structure there are two classes

Ye et al. Biosynthesis of Argimycins P
of alkaloids: heterocyclic or typical alkaloids and
non-heterocyclic/atypical/protoalkaloids bearing nitrogen
atoms in a side chain (Cushnie et al., 2014). Some of the most
important alkaloids contain a piperidine ring, and in the so
called true alkaloids these rings derive from amino acids.
However, some piperidine-containing alkaloids or piperidine
pseudoalkaloids from polyketide origin acquire their nitrogen
atoms via transamination reactions (Sigrist et al., 2015).
Actinomycetes are a group of bacteria that have attracted the
attention of academic and industrial researchers, because they
produce a plethora of natural products displaying antibiotic,
antitumor, immunosuppressant or anthelmintic activities (Bérdy,
2012; Newman and Cragg, 2016). Most of these compounds are
peptides (ribosomal and non-ribosomal synthesized), polyketides
or terpenes. Particularly, several piperidine-containing alkaloids
of polyketide origin have been isolated from actinomycetes,
such as coelimycin P (Gómez-Escribano et al., 2012), cyclizidine
(Freer et al., 1982), iromycins (Surup et al., 2007), latumcidin
(also known as abikoviromycin; Seto et al., 1973), piericidins
(Zhou and Fenical, 2016), strepchazolins (Y ang et al., 2017),
streptazolins (Mayer and Thiericke, 1993; Puder et al., 2001),
streptazones AñD (Puder et al., 2000), streptazone E (Liu et al.,
2013), or streptopyridines (Groenhagen et al., 2014). These
compounds show a range of activities such as antimicrobial,
antiviral, cytotoxic, decreasing blood pressure and cholesterol
biosynthesis, or analgesic (Umezawa et al., 1951; Terashima
et al., 1970; Grabley et al., 1991; Puder et al., 2001). However,
information about their biosynthesis pathways is quite scarce.
Thus, only the biosynthesis gene clusters for coelimycin P ,
cyclizidine and streptazone E have been identiﬁed so far (Gómez-
Escribano et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2015; Ohno et al., 2015).
Biosynthesis of these compounds involves a Type I or modular
polyketide synthase (PKS). These are macroenzyme complexes
typically organized into modules, which are responsible for
a single elongation cycle and contains a β-ketoacyl synthase
(KS), an acyltransferase (AT) and an acyl carrier protein
(ACP) domain. In addition, these modules can contain optional
domains such as ketoreductase (KR), dehydratase (DH) or enoyl
reductase (ER) that modify the β-keto group after an elongation
event (Weissman, 2015).
Argimycins P ( Figure 1A ) comprise a group of polyketide
alkaloid compounds produced by Streptomyces argillaceusATCC
12956 that show either a piperideine ring, or a piperidine ring
fused or not with a ﬁve-membered ring, and a polyene side chain.
In addition, some argimycins P contain an N-acetylcysteine
moiety. Very recently, we have reported the isolation and
chemical characterization of these compounds that seem to
play some role in both growth and colony development in the
producer strain (Ye et al., 2017). In addition, we also reported
the identiﬁcation of the argimycins P biosynthesis gene cluster
arp and showed that biosynthesis of nigrifactin, a putative
intermediate containing a piperideine ring, requires the ArpP
PKS and the ArpN aminotransferase (Ye et al., 2017). Herein we
describe new insights into the argimycin P biosynthesis pathway
through the inactivation of arp genes putatively involved in post-
piperideine ring formation biosynthesis steps, the identiﬁcation
and characterization of the compounds produced by each
mutant, and cross-feeding experiments between mutants. In
addition, we also address the regulation of argimycins P
biosynthesis by studying the expression pattern of the arp genes
in mutants in speciﬁc regulatory genes in comparison with the
wild type strain.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Strains, Culture Conditions, Plasmids
and DNA Manipulations
Streptomyces argillaceus ATCC 12956 was used as source of
DNA to generate mutants and for argimycins P production
experiments. The argimycin P-non producers S. argillaceus
MARPPIII (PKS-minus mutant), S. argillaceus MARPN
(aminotransferase-minus mutant), S. argillaceus DARPO-HII
(mutant with a deletion from arpO to arpHII), S. argillaceus
MARPRI (positive regulatory arpRI-minus mutant) and
S. argillaceus MARPRII (negative regulatory arpRII-minus
mutant) ( Table 1) (Ye et al., 2017) were used in co-synthesis
and/or bioconversion experiments, and to quantify argimycins
P production. Escherichia coli DH10B (Invitrogen) and
E. coli ET12567/pUB307 (Kieser et al., 2000) were used as
cloning hosts for plasmid propagation and for conjugation
experiments, respectively. MA and SM10 media (Fernández
et al., 1998; Ye et al., 2017) were used for sporulation and
argimycins P production by S. argillaceus, respectively. When
required, antibiotics were added to media at the following
ﬁnal concentrations: ampicillin (100 µg/mL), kanamycin
(50 µg/mL), nalidixic acid (25 µg/mL), apramycin (25 µg/mL),
and thiostrepton (50 µg/mL). Plasmids pCRBlunt (Invitrogen)
and pUO9090 (M. C. Martín, unpublished results) were used
for subcloning. Plasmid pHZ1358 (Sun et al., 2002) was
used for generating mutants by gene replacement. pIAGO
(Aguirrezabalaga et al., 2000), pSETE (I. García, personal
communication), pSETec and pSETeTc (Cano-Prieto et al.,
2015) were used for complementing mutants and overexpressing
arp genes. DNA manipulations, intergeneric conjugations
and transformations were carried out according to standard
procedures for Streptomyces (Kieser et al., 2000) and for
E. coli (Sambrook and Russell, 2001). PCR ampliﬁcations were
done using Herculase (Stratagene) and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO). Puriﬁed amplicons were sequenced and compared to
others in databases. Sequence analyses were carried out using
BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997).
Generation of Mutants
Mutants in speciﬁc arp genes were generated by replacing
most of the corresponding genes by an apramycin resistance
cassette that was inserted in the same direction of transcription
(Table 1 ). Accordingly, several plasmids were constructed in
pHZ1358 by PCR amplifying DNA regions ﬂanked the target
gene using oligonucleotides described in Supplementary Table
S1, and by inserting an apramycin resistance cassette between
those fragments (see Supplementary Material). Ampliﬁed DNA
fragments were checked by DNA sequencing. The resultant

constructs were introduced in S. argillaceus and apramycin-
resistant, thiostrepton-sensitive transconjugants were selected
to identify mutants in which the wild type copy of the target
gene was replaced by the mutated one. These mutants were
conﬁrmed by PCR ampliﬁcation of the mutated region using
oligonucleotides from Supplementary Table S1, followed by
sequencing of the ampliﬁed DNA fragments.
Plasmids for Expressing arp Genes
Several plasmids were constructed to complement diﬀerent
S. argillaceus arpmutants (Table 1). To this aim, single arp genes
were ampliﬁed using the corresponding oligonucleotides from
Supplementary Table S2, and subcloned under the control of
the erythromycin resistance promoter. arpHI, arpHII, arpO, and
arpK were ampliﬁed as SpeI-XbaI DNA fragments and subcloned
into the XbaI site of pIAGO; arpDHII was also ampliﬁed as a
SpeI-XbaI DNA fragment but subcloned into the XbaI site of
pSETeTc; arpDHI was ampliﬁed as a NheI-XbaI DNA fragment
and subcloned into the XbaI site of pIAGO.
Plasmids pSETEcRI and pSETERII were constructed
to independently overexpress regulatory genes arpRI and
arpRII, respectively, in the wild type strain ( Table 1 ). To

construct pSETEcRI, arpRI was ampliﬁed using oligonucleotides
SARP_ATG_Abisbis/378SARP_B (Supplementary Table S2),
subcloned into pCR-Blunt, and the fragment released as an EcoRI
fragment (using these sites from the vector) to be subcloned
into the same site of pSETec, downstream of the erythromycin
resistance promoter. To construct pSETERII, arpRII was
ampliﬁed as a BamHI DNA fragment using oligonucleotides
SA1701orf4A/SA1701orf4B (Supplementary Table S2) and
subcloned into the BamHI site of pSETE, downstream of the
erythromycin resistance promoter.
UPLC Analysis and Puriﬁcation of
Argimycins P
Argimycins P were extracted with n-butanol and analyzed by
reversed-phase chromatography as previously reported (Ye et al.,
2017). Chromatograms were recorded at 400, 272, and 230 nm.
For puriﬁcation purposes, S. argillaceus mutant strains were
grown by a two-step culture method as previously described
(Fernández et al., 1998), using forty 250-mL Erlenmeyer ﬂasks
in the production step. Puriﬁcation of new argimycins P
was carried out as previously described (Ye et al., 2017),
using isocratic chromatography conditions optimized for each
compound. Structures of new compounds were characterized by
LC/MS (liquid chromatography mass spectrometry) and Nuclear

Magnetic Resonance (NMR) analyses. A combination of 1D ( 1H
and 13C), and 2D ( 1H-1H COSY , TOCSY , HSQC and HMBC)
analyses were carried for structural elucidation by NMR.
Co-synthesis and Bioconversion
Experiments
For co-synthesis analyses, 100 µl of seed cultures from each
strain were used to inoculate 3 ml of SM10 medium contained
into a well of a 24-square deep-well plate. After 24 h of growth,
co-synthesis cultures were prepared by combining cultures from
two individual cultures (1.5 ml from each) into a well. Samples
were harvested after 0, 24, and 48 h of incubation.
For bioconversion experiments with nigrifactin, cultures of
the diﬀerent mutant strains in SM10 medium were fed with
nigrifactin (0.1 mM ﬁnal concentration). Samples were harvested
after 24 h of incubation.
Transcription Analyses
Total RNA was obtained from S. argillaceus wild type and
S. argillaceus mutants MARPRI and MARPRII as previously
described (Flórez et al., 2015). This RNA was used as template for
gene expression analysis by reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR)
and real time PCR (qPCR). Qualitative gene expression was
studied using the SuperScript
R⃝IIITM One-Step RT-PCR system
with Platinum
R⃝ Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). cDNA
synthesis was performed using 50 ng or 100 ng of total RNA as
template at 50 ◦C for 30 min, followed by heating at 94 ◦C for
2 min. Sample mixtures included 32.2 U of RNA-guard RNase
inhibitor (Amersham Biosciences). Ampliﬁcation conditions
were as follows: 33 cycles of 98 ◦C for 15 s; 62 ◦C for 45 s;
72◦C for 1 min; and a ﬁnal extension step at 72 ◦C for 10 min.
Oligonucleotides (Supplementary Table S3) were designed within
every arp gene to produce cDNAs of approximately 350ñ550 bp.
Primers for arpRI and arpRII were designed to amplify an
internal DNA region located upstream of the inserted apramycin
resistance cassette. In the case of arpRII the cDNA product was
of approximately 150 bp. The identity of these fragments was
veriﬁed by direct sequencing. Negative controls for each pair of
primers were carried out with Platinum Taq DNA polymerase
(Invitrogen) in the absence of reverse transcriptase. hrdB gene
expression levels were used to normalize RNA concentration of
the tested strains. The RT-PCR products were resolved by 1.4%
agarose gel electrophoresis stained with ethidium bromide and
visualized using a Gel Doc analyzer (Bio-Rad).
qPCR was used to quantify gene expression of selected genes
in mutants MARPRI and MARPRII, in relation to the wild
type strain. A total amount of 0.6 µg of RNA was used to
synthesize cDNA using the AﬃnityScript QPCR cDNA synthesis
kit (Bio-Rad). qPCRs were carried out on an Stratagene Mx3000P
(Agilent Technologies), with a Brilliant II SYBR
R⃝ green QPCR
master mix (Agilent Technologies). Triplicate PCR reactions
were carried out for each sample analyzed. hrdB was used as
housekeeping gene in each sample in order to standardize the
results by eliminating variation in RNA and cDNA quantity
and quality. Absence of chromosomal DNA contamination was
checked by qPCR. Primers (Supplementary Table S3) were

designed using the algorithms provided by Primer Express
software 2.0 (Applied Biosystems), and their eﬃciency was
calculated based on the slope of a standard curve. To determine
ampliﬁcation speciﬁcity an additional dissociation curve analysis
was performed after the last cycle, showing in all cases one single
peak. PCR results were given as the increase in the ﬂuorescence
signal of the reporter dye detected and visualized by the MxPro
Software provided with the version 4.1 (Agilent Technologies).
Changes in gene expression are represented with respect to the

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Generation and Characterization of
S. argillaceusMutants in arp Genes
The arp gene cluster contains 14 genes: 11 for structural proteins
(arpDHI, arpDHII, arpHI, arpHII, arpK, arpN, arpO, arpPI,
arpPII, arpPIII, and arpT), two coding for regulatory proteins
(arpRI and arpRII), and one for a hypothetical protein ( arpX).
We have previously shown that formation of the piperideine
ring of argimycins P is achieved by expressing the arpPI, arpPII,
and arpPIII genes that encode a hexamodular PKS and the
arpN aminotransferase gene (Ye et al., 2017). In order to obtain
further insights into argimycin P biosynthesis and to assign
functions to other arp coding genes, a set of gene-knockout
experiments were carried out, followed by metabolic proﬁle
analyses. Mutants were obtained by replacing the wild type copy
of the gene in the S. argillaceus chromosome by an in vitro
mutated one. Several constructs in the unstable plasmid pHZ1358
were generated, in which most of the target arp gene was
replaced by an apramycin resistance cassette inserted in the
direction of transcription of the targeted gene. The resultant
constructs were introduced into S. argillaceus, and apramycin-
resistant thiostrepton-sensitive transconjugants were selected.
One mutant for each inactivated gene was selected for further
characterization. The occurrence of a double recombination
event in each mutant strain was genetically veriﬁed by PCR
analyses using proper oligoprimers (Supplementary Table S1).
In order to determine that no other gene except the target
gene was aﬀected, in trans complementation of each mutant
was carried out using plasmids expressing the corresponding
gene and by conﬁrming the recovery of argimycins P production
(Table 1 and Supplementary Figure S1). The mutants were
further characterized for production of argimycins P (or analogs)
by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) and
HPLC-MS analyses, and the new compounds accumulated by the
mutants puriﬁed and characterized.
Mutants inarpDHI and arpDHII Genes
The arp gene cluster contains two contiguous genes transcribed
in the same direction ( arpDHI and arpDHII) that code for
dehydrogenases: ArpDHI is similar to acyl-CoA dehydrogenases,
and it has been hypothesized to be involved in the hydroxylation
of the piperidine ring and/or in the reduction of the
C7ñC8 double bond of the polyene chain during argimycins
P biosynthesis (Ye et al., 2017). ArpDHII is similar to
6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenases, and it has been proposed to
be an imine reductase catalyzing the reduction of the imine group
(Ye et al., 2017). Using pHZMutorf6 and pHZMutorf7long, the
wild type copy of arpDHI and arpDHII were replaced by an
apramycin resistance cassette, generating mutants MARPDHI
and MARPDHII, respectively ( Table 1 and Supplementary
Figures S2, S3). Analysis of cultures of mutant MARPDHI
(Figure 2) revealed production of compounds containing a single
piperideine or a piperidine ring (nigrifactin and argimycin PIX;
Figure 1A) and the disappearance of argimycins P compounds
containing the ﬁve-membered ring (Figure 1A). Further analysis
of this mutant showed that it also produced argimycins PVII
and PVIII (peak 3 ∗ in Figure 2 ; see below). These results
indicated that ArpDHI is involved in an early biosynthesis step
of argimycins P prior to the ﬁve-membered ring formation. Since
argimycin PVIII and PIX are produced by mutant MARPDHI,
this ruled out ArpDHI from the reduction of the C7ñC8 double
bond of the polyene side chain and in the reduction of the imine.
Cultures of MARPDHII contained traces of unidentiﬁed
argimycin P-like compounds and a small amount of nigrifactin
(Figure 2B ). This result reinforced the hypothesis of ArpDHII
acting in an early biosynthesis step as an imine reductase,
most likely before ArpDHI. Based on this result, bioconversions
experiments were designed to conﬁrm this activity. Accordingly,
nigrifactin which contains an imine group was fed to cultures of
the argimycin P non-producer S. argillaceus MARPPIII (PKS-
minus mutant) to determine if nigrifactin could be converted
to other argimycins P. After 24 h of incubation, a new peak
was detected (peak VII in Figure 3 ) that showed the same
retention time, mass and absorption spectrum as argimycin
PVII (Figure 1B; see below). This bioconversion indicated that
the imine group in nigrifactin is reduced to the amino group
in argimycin PVII. Since none of the argimycins P bearing
the ﬁve-membered ring was detected, this result also suggested
that neither nigrifactin nor argimycin PVII were biosynthetic
intermediates for the formation of the ﬁve-membered ring
compounds. To determine if the imine reductase coding gene
was an arp gene, nigrifactin was fed to S. argillaceus DARPO-
HII (a mutant with a deletion from arpO to arpHII; Table 1).
Argimycin PVII could not be detected ( Figure 3 ), indicating
that one of the arp deleted genes in this mutant was responsible
for reduction of the imine. Finally, to identify this arp gene,
nigrifactin was fed to S. argillaceus DARPO-HII expressing
arpDHII (S. argillaceus DARPO-HII-pSETETorf7; Table 1). In
this case, argimycin PVII was detected ( Figure 3). These results
conﬁrmed the function of ArpDHII as the imine reductase
involved in argimycins P biosynthesis.
Mutants inarpHI and arpHII Genes
arpHI and arpHII are two small genes convergently transcribed
that code for proteins belonging to the NTF2_like superfamily,
which have been proposed to be cyclases (Ye et al., 2017). Using
pHZMutorf9a and pHZMutorf9b, each gene was individually
mutated by replacing the corresponding wild type copies by
apramycin resistance cassettes, generating mutants MARPHI
and MARPHII, respectively ( Table 1 and Supplementary
Figures S4, S5). The metabolite proﬁles from both mutants

were similar ( Figure 2 ): they only produced nigrifactin and
argimycin PIX. In addition, two new peaks, absent in the wild
type strain, were detected at 272 nm (peak 1; Figure 2B ) and
230 nm (peaks 1 and 2; Figure 2C ), with retention times of
3.04 and 3.13 min, respectively. Peak 2 contained a compound
displaying a maximum at ca. 228 nm in the UV (DAD) spectrum
that was identical to the previously characterized argimycin
PIX (Ye et al., 2017). After puriﬁcation of this compound
its molecular formula was established as C 12H19NO based on
the pseudomolecular ion peak [M +H]+ observed at 194.1541
(calcd. for C 12H20NO+ =194.1539). NMR analysis revealed
the presence of an epoxide, which accounted for the extra
oxygen and degree of unsaturation (Supplementary Figures S6,
S7, S10, and Supplementary Table S4). This new compound was
named argimycin PXI ( Figure 1B ). On the other hand, peak
1 contained two compounds with diﬀerent masses (m/z values
of 192 [M +H]+and 194 [M +H]+). Importantly, levels of the
lower-mass compound greatly decreased when cultures were
incubated in the dark, which enabled the puriﬁcation of the
higher-mass compound by cultivating MARPHII in darkness.
NMR analysis conﬁrmed it as having a structure equal to
argimycin PXI but with Z stereochemistry in the middle double
bond of the side chain (Supplementary Figures S8ñS10 and Table
S5). This new compound was named argimycin PX ( Figure 1B).
In addition, cultures of MARPHI and MARPHII revealed
another peak eluting around 3.5 min (peak 3; Figures 2B,C ).
Analysis of peak 3 by HPLC-MS showed three compounds
with diﬀerent masses (178 [M +H]+, 180 [M +H]+ and 230
[M+H]+). The lowest-mass compound (178 [M +H]+) diﬀered
only in two units from nigrifactin (176 [M +H]+), and it was

hypothesized that this compound (named argimycin PVII) could
be an analog of nigrifactin bearing an amino rather than an
imine group. To prove this, nigrifactin was subjected to chemical
reduction with sodium borohydride (NaBH 4). Thus, after 1 h
of reaction nigrifactin was completely consumed and a new
compound appeared with the same retention time and mass
(178 [M +H]+) as argimycin PVII ( Figure 4 ). NMR analyses
(Supplementary Figures S11, S12 and Supplementary Table S6)
conﬁrmed the structure of argimycin PVII ( Figure 1B ). This
compound was previously reported by Ohno et al. (2015). To
enable isolation of the other two compounds from peak 3,
MARPHII was cultivated on darkness since the production
of argimycin PVII greatly decreased under these conditions.
Accordingly, a sample enriched in the two other compounds
was puriﬁed. The compound with the highest mass, the most
abundant, showed a molecular formula of C 12H20ClNO based
on the pseudomolecular ion peak [M+H]+observed at 230.1307
(calcd. for C 12H21ClNO+ = 230.1306). NMR elucidation
revealed a chlorohydrin structurally related to the epoxide found
in argimycin PXI (Supplementary Figures S10, S13, S14 and
Supplementary Table S8). This new compound was named
argimycin PXII ( Figure 1B ). Regarding the minor compound,
the molecular formula was established as C 12H21N based on the
pseudomolecular ion peak [M+H]+observed at 180.1748 (calcd.
for C12H22N+=180.1747) that was identical to argimycin PIX
(Ye et al., 2017), and NMR analyses (Supplementary Figures S13,
S14 and Supplementary Table S7) conﬁrmed that this compound,
which was named argimycin PVIII ( Figure 1B), is a geometric
isomer of argimycin PIX. On the other hand, careful analysis
of cultures from the wild type strain and from some other
arp mutants showed that argimycin PVII and PVIII but not
argimycin PXII, were identiﬁed in the metabolite proﬁles of these
strains (peak 3 ∗, Figures 2B,C). All these results conﬁrmed that
MARPHI and MARPHII are blocked before the cyclization event
that leads to the formation of the ﬁve-membered ring.
Mutant inarpO
arpO is divergently transcribed from arpDHI and arpDHII.
It shows high similarity to several putative oxidases including
amino oxidases, and contains domains present in dehydrogenases
proteins. Using pHZMutorf5 most of the wild type copy of arpO
was replaced by an apramycin resistance cassette, generating
mutant MARPO ( Table 1 and Supplementary Figure S15).
Analysis of the metabolite proﬁle produced by MARPO revealed
that it produced all argimycins P except argimycins PI and PII
(Figure 2 ). These compounds diﬀer from other argimycins P
with two rings by containing a pyridine instead of a piperidine
ring and by the presence of an N-acetylcysteine residue attached
to the polyene chain ( Figure 1A ). Moreover, two new peaks
were detected in cultures of MARPO at 276 nm ( Figure 2B ),
which eluted at 2.75 and 3.15 min, respectively. The early
peak contained a single compound that was too unstable to be
puriﬁed. The late peak (peak 4 in Figure 2B) was puriﬁed and
showed a maximum at 288 nm in the UV/vis spectrum. The
HRMS information rendered a molecular formula of C 12H17N
based on the observed ion [M +H]+ at 176.1433 (calcd. for
C12H18N+ =176.1434). Such formula was identical to that

of argimycin PVI. Elucidation of the structure was assisted
by comparing its NMR data (Supplementary Figures S16ñS18,
and Supplementary Table S9) to those from argimycins PIV ,
PV and PVI (Ye et al., 2017). The proposed structure for
this new compound, named argimycin PXIV ( Figure 1B ), was
similar to that of argimycin PVI ( Figure 1A ) but diﬀering in
the position of the double bond, which was between C4ñC4a
in the former and between C6ñC7 in the latter. These results
suggest that ArpO could be a dehydrogenase involved in
the oxidation of the piperidine ring leading to the pyridine
ring.
Mutants inarpK and arpX Genes
ArpK is highly similar to ﬂavin reductases and its coding gene is
located upstream of arpHI. A mutant by gene replacement was
generated in this gene (MARPK) using pHZMutorf9 ( Table 1
and Supplementary Figure S19). This mutant showed a similar
metabolite proﬁle as the wild type strain, but argimycins PI/PII
and argimycin PIV were not detected (Figures 2A,B). This result
supports the function of ArpK as regenerating ﬂavin nucleotides
that could be used by ArpO.
Downstream of arpRII is located arpX that codes for a
protein of unknown function. A mutant by gene replacement
was generated using pHZMutorf14 ( Table 1 and Supplementary
Figure S20). Analysis of the metabolite proﬁle of the resultant
mutant MARPX showed that it produced diminished amounts
of all argimycins P (Figure 2).

Ye et al. Biosynthesis of Argimycins P
Co-synthesis between Mutant Strains
In order to elucidate the order of the biosynthesis steps in
argimycin P pathway, co-synthesis experiments were carried out
between every mutant in arp structural gene and MARPPIII
(PKS-minus mutant). No argimycin P containing two rings
were detected when MARPN, MARPDHI, or MARPDHII were
co-cultivated with MARPPIII (data not shown). These results
indicated that either compounds accumulated by these mutants
were not diﬀusible or unable to enter in the cell, or they were
not real biosynthesis intermediates. However, when MARPHI
or MARPHII were co-cultivated with MARPPIII, formation
of argimycin PV and argimycin PVI was detected, while
none of these compounds were produced by any of these
mutants when grown individually ( Figure 5A ). This indicated
that these mutants accumulated biosynthesis intermediates
that were modiﬁed by MARPPIII leading to the formation
of ﬁve-membered ring compounds. However, co-cultivation
between MARPHI and MARPHII did not aﬀect argimycin P
production proﬁles (data not shown). These results conﬁrm
that ArpN, ArpDHI, and ArpDHII were involved in earlier
biosynthesis steps, before formation of the ﬁve-membered ring,
and strongly support that ArpHI and ArpHII would cooperate
in the cyclization reaction leading to the formation of the ﬁve-
membered ring. On the other hand, by co-cultivating MARPO
with MARPPIII production of argimycin PI/PII was recovered,
indicating that MARPO accumulated biosynthesis intermediates
that can be modiﬁed by an arpO expressing strain resulting in the
formation of these two argimycins P (Figure 5B).
Based on all these results, we propose a model for the
biosynthesis of argimycins P that can be divided into several
stages (Figure 6). In the initial steps the piperideine ring would
be synthesized. The ArpPI, ArpPII, and ArpPIII PKS would
render the thioester hexaketide 1 according to the speciﬁcities
of the PKS catalytic domains (Supplementary Figure S21).
This polyketide, similar to cyclizidine (Peng et al., 2016) and
coelimycin P (Awodi et al., 2017) biosynthesis pathways, would
be reductively released by the thioester reductase domain present
in the PKS subunit ArpPIII to render the putative aldehyde 2.
Then, transamination by aminotransferase ArpN of the aldehyde
group of the released polyketide chain would occur rendering the
hypothetical product 3, followed by its non-enzymatic cyclization
to generate the putative biosynthesis intermediate 4 with a
piperideine ring. Spontaneous dehydration and reduction of 4
would occur to provide nigrifactin.
The next step would be the formation of the piperidine ring.
This is supported by the fact that all mutants in arp genes
except MARPDHII accumulate compounds with a piperidine
ring, which suggests the reduction of the imine group should be
an early biosynthesis step. Most probably, this reaction would
occur following the transamination reaction as it has been
recently reported in the cyclizidine biosynthesis pathway (Peng
et al., 2016). ArpDHII is proposed as a candidate to carry out
this imine reduction step. Unlike the proposed streptazone E
biosynthesis pathway (Ohno et al., 2015), neither nigrifactin nor
argimycin PVII, PVIII, and PIX seem to be intermediates in
the biosynthesis of argimycins P containing two rings, since
recovery of its production was not achieved either in co-synthesis
experiments between mutants (e.g., MARPDHI or MARPDHII
vs. MARPPIII), or in bioconversion experiments with nigrifactin
by mutant MARPPIII. Therefore, formation of nigrifactin and
its reduction to argimycin PVII would rather form part of
a biosynthesis side pathway leading to argimycin PVIII and
PIX, while a diﬀerent intermediate should be used in the main
pathway leading to the formation of two rings-argimycins P. That
intermediate could be the putative biosynthesis intermediate 4,
that after reduction by ArpDHII would generate the putative
intermediate 5. This compound has not been identiﬁed so
far in cultures of S. argillaceus wild type or any arp mutant,
however, structurally related compounds have been identiﬁed
in other Streptomyces strains that also produce piperidine
polyketide compounds (Puder et al., 2000; Groenhagen et al.,
2014).

argimycin PVI.
Five-membered ring cyclization would be preceded by
formation of biosynthesis intermediates containing epoxy
groups. This type of compounds (argimycin PX and PXI) is
only produced by mutants MARPHI and MARPHII. Since these
two mutants co-synthesize with mutant MARPPIII, it is deduced
that compounds accumulated by these mutants are intermediates
for the biosynthesis of argimycins P containing two rings. It
is proposed that ArpDHI would be involved in the formation
of these epoxide containing compounds by oxidizing a putative
intermediate with a double bond generated by spontaneous
dehydration of compound 5. The next stage would be the ﬁve-
membered ring formation. According to our results and similarly
to the streptazone E biosynthesis pathway (Ohno et al., 2015),
this cyclization event could be coupled to ring-opening of the
epoxide, and would be carried out in a cooperative manner by
ArpHI and ArpHII.
The ﬁnal biosynthesis step would be formation of argimycins
PI/PII that contain a pyridine ring and an N-acetylcysteine
moiety. It is proposed a role of ArpO (and ArpK) in formation
of these compounds by oxidizing a biosynthesis intermediate
accumulated by MARPO, including oxidation of the amino
group to render the imine. This type of oxidation has already
been reported in the biosynthesis of the alkaloid polyketide
abikoviromycin by Tsuruoka et al. (1973), which puriﬁed an
oxidoreductase from its producer that carries out the oxidation
of the amino group into the imine group of this compound.
Further attachment of N-acetylcysteine to the oxidized product
synthesized by ArpO would generate argimycins PI/PII. Most
probably, this would be a non-enzymatic event as it has
been reported for the biosynthesis of other N-acetylcysteine-
containing compounds (Suzuki et al., 2006; Gómez-Escribano
et al., 2012; Maier et al., 2014).
Regulation of arp Gene Cluster
The arp gene cluster contains two cluster situated regulators
(CSR; Huang et al., 2005): arpRI codes for a SARP-like
activator and its inactivation completely blocks argimycins P
production; arpRII codes for a TetR-like repressor and its
inactivation increases argimycins P production (Ye et al., 2017).
To conﬁrm their regulatory role, both genes were independently
overexpressed into S. argillaceus and production of nigrifactin,
argimycin PI/II, PV , and PVI was quantiﬁed in the resultant
recombinant strains and in regulatory mutant strains MARPRI
and MARPRII as well (Supplementary Figure S22). S. argillaceus
containing the empty vector and S. argillaceus wild type strains
were used as controls. Production of argimycins P was completely

blocked in MARPRI, while it increased in MARPRII between 56
and 259%, depending of the argimycin P analyzed. On the other
hand, overexpression of arpRI (pSETEcRI) led to an increase
(between 23 and 94%), and that of arpRII (pSETERII) to a
decrease (between 48 and 87%) in argimycins P production,
depending of the argimycin P quantiﬁed. These results conﬁrmed
the role of ArpRI and ArpRII as activator and repressor in
argimycin P biosynthesis, respectively. In order to delve deeper
into their role in transcriptional regulation of arp cluster,
expression analysis of arp genes in these mutants was evaluated
by RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from cultures ofS. argillaceus
wild type strains and mutants MARPRI and MARPRII, after 24 h
of growth. As shown inFigure 7A, all genes were expressed in the
wild type strain including both regulatory genes. On the contrary,
in MARPRI no transcripts were detected forarpO, arpDHI, arpN,
arpPI, arpPIII, and arpT. Noticeable, arpDHII, arpK, arpHI,
arpHII, arpPII, and arpX were still transcribed but at lower
extent. This was conﬁrmed by qRT-PCR analyses that showed the
expression levels of these genes were lower in MARPRI in relation
to the wild type strain (Figure 7B). This could be explained by the
existence of alternative promoters ArpRI-independent upstream
of those genes. These results were consistent with the idea that
ArpRI was an essential regulator of argimycins P biosynthesis.
In MARPRII mutant, all arp genes were transcribed apparently
at higher levels than in the wild type strain. One exception
was arpRII, since it was not transcribed ( Figure 7A). To better
understand the relationship between both regulatory genes, qRT-
PCR analyses of them were carried out in each regulatory mutant.
As observed in Figure 7C, expression of arpRI and arpRII was
slightly lower in MARPRI, and expression of arpRI was higher

and that of arpRII was much lower in MARPRII, in comparison
to the wild type strain. Based on these results, we propose a model
for the regulation of argimycins P biosynthesis ( Figure 7D ),
in which ArpRII positively controls expression of its coding
gene and negatively controls expression of arpRI whose gene
product in turn positively controls expression of all arp
genes.
CONCLUSION
We have characterized the post-piperideine ring biosynthesis
steps of argimycins P , a group of piperidine-containing
polyketides, signiﬁcantly broadening the knowledge about the
biosynthesis steps of this type of compounds and of its regulation.
Moreover, we have pointed out important diﬀerences between the
biosynthesis pathway of argimycins P and that of the structurally
related streptazone E. Thus, the arp cluster shows high synteny
to other clusters in Streptomyces, such as the streptazone E gene
cluster (stz) from Streptomyces sp. MSC090213JE08 (Ohno et al.,
2015) (Supplementary Figure S23). Interestingly, Streptomyces
sp. MSC090213JE08 does not produce the two ring-containing
argimycins P but Streptazone E and in addition, S. argillaceus
produce a number of argimycins P (PVII to PXII) bearing a single
piperidine ring, which have not been identiﬁed in cultures of
Streptomyces sp. MSC090213JE08. These facts suggest diﬀerences
between both pathways at diﬀerent levels. Thus, the hexaketides
synthesized by the Arp and the Stz PKS should be diﬀerent,
since module 5 from ArpPIII contains an inactive dehydratase
domain (Supplementary Figure S21), while the corresponding
module from StzB contains an active one. Another diﬀerence
could be at the regulatory level. Transcriptional analyses of the
arp cluster have shown that some genes could be expressed from
two diﬀerent promoters, an ArpRI-dependent and an ArpRI-
independent, which could account for higher expression of those
genes and consequently of the corresponding gene products.
The imine reductase arpDHII is one such gene and this could
partially explain why most one ring-containing argimycins P
so far identiﬁed in S. argillaceus contain a piperidine ring,
while in the case of Streptomyces sp. MSC090213JE08 these
compounds contain a piperideine ring. In addition, diﬀerences
could exist at the enzymatic level. Thus, ArpO shows high
similarity (80% identical aminoacids) to the FAD-dependent
monooxygenase StzK identiﬁed in the streptazone E gene cluster
(Ohno et al., 2015). However, StzK has been involved in the
formation of the epoxide ring which is later opened in the
cyclization step to form the ﬁve-membered ring, while ArpO
would act after the ﬁve-membered ring was formed, oxidizing
the amino group. All these diﬀerences indicate that similar gene
clusters can direct the biosynthesis of structurally similar but
diﬀerent compounds.
On the other hand, we have identiﬁed ﬁve new compounds
(argimycins PVIII, PX, PXI, PXII, and PXIV) that can be
expanded to produce other analogs, and generated several mutant
strains that can be used as hosts to express genes from other
biosynthesis gene clusters (e.g., from other polyketide alkaloid
gene clusters) and vice versa, the characterized arp coding genes
can be expressed in other producers to generate new potentially
bioactive compounds (Méndez and Salas, 2003; Olano et al.,
2014). Moreover,arp coding enzymes such as the ArpDHII imine
reductase could contribute to extend the biocatalysis toolbox with
new enzymes with potential application to make pharmaceuticals
and agrochemicals (Schrittwieser et al., 2015; Sigrist et al., 2015).
