Abstract 
Background: The physiological characterization of microorganisms provides valuable information for bioprocess 
development. Chemostat cultivations are a powerful tool for this purpose, as they allow defined changes to one 
single parameter at a time, which is most commonly the growth rate. The subsequent establishment of a steady state 
then permits constant variables enabling the acquisition of reproducible data sets for comparing microbial perfor-
mance under different conditions. We performed physiological characterizations of a 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) 
producing Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain in a miniaturized and parallelized chemostat cultivation system. The physi-
ological conditions under investigation were various growth rates controlled by different nutrient limitations (C, N, P). 
Based on the cultivation parameters obtained subsequent fed-batch cultivations were designed.
Results: We report technical advancements of a small-scale chemostat cultivation system and its applicability for 
reliable strain screening under different physiological conditions, i.e. varying dilution rates and different substrate limi-
tations (C, N, P). Exploring the performance of an engineered 3-HP producing S. cerevisiae strain under carbon-limiting 
conditions revealed the highest 3-HP yields per substrate and biomass of 16.6 %C-mol and 0.43 g gCDW
−1, respec-
tively, at the lowest set dilution rate of 0.04 h−1. 3-HP production was further optimized by applying N- and P-limiting 
conditions, which resulted in a further increase in 3-HP yields revealing values of 21.1 %C-mol and 0.50 g gCDW−1 
under phosphate-limiting conditions. The corresponding parameters favoring an increased 3-HP production, i.e. dilu-
tion rate as well as C- and P-limiting conditions, were transferred from the small-scale chemostat cultivation system to 
1-L bench-top fermenters operating in fed-batch conditions, revealing 3-HP yields of 15.9 %C-mol and 0.45 g gCDW
−1 
under C-limiting, as well as 25.6 %C-mol and 0.50 g gCDW−1 under phosphate-limiting conditions.
Conclusions: Small-scale chemostat cultures are well suited for the physiological characterization of microorganisms, 
particularly for investigating the effect of changing cultivation parameters on microbial performance. In our study, 
optimal conditions for 3-HP production comprised (i) a low dilution rate of 0.04 h
−1 under carbon-limiting condi-
tions and (ii) the use of phosphate-limiting conditions. Similar 3-HP yields were achieved in chemostat and fed-batch 
cultures under both C- and P-limiting conditions proving the growth rate as robust parameter for process transfer and 
thus the small-scale chemostat system as powerful tool for process optimization.

Introduction
Besides strain engineering, the establishment of a com -
mercially viable bioprocess requires multiple screening 
procedures, process development, and optimizations 
as well as process validation and scale-up trials. Fully 
equipped stirred tank reactors are considered to be the 
gold standard for quantitative strain characterizations, 
allowing versatile cultivation modes, such as batch and 
fed-batch, and the precise on-line measurement and con
-
trol of various cultivation parameters, such as dissolved 
oxygen and pH levels. Novel microbioreactor (MBR) 
systems, ranging from down-scaled stirred tank reactors 
to advanced shaken microtiter plate cultivation devices, 
have been developed to meet the increasing need for high 
throughput strain screening and testing of relevant cul
-
tivation conditions [1]. Efforts towards designing MBR 
systems are reflected in robust cultivation devices, such 
as the parallelized small-scale chemostat bioreactor sys
-
tem based on Hungate tubes [2] and the microtiter plate 
based system for high-throughput temperature optimiza
-
tion for microbial and enzymatic systems [3]. A few MBR 
systems have been further developed, and even reached 
commercialization, such as the ambr system (Sartorius) 
or the BioLector (m2p-labs). Certain MBR systems allow 
various cultivation modes with the possibility to moni
-
tor and control process parameters selectively, whereas 
other systems only support one mode of cultivation, i.e. 
continuous or fed-batch mode. Chemostat cultivations 
provide defined and constant cultivation conditions, 
where single parameters such as temperature, pH, nutri
-
ent composition or concentration can be investigated 
in relation to the growth rate applied [4]. Industrial bio
-
processes usually favor cultivations in fed-batch mode, as 
this cultivation mode has been found effective in circum
-
venting undesired phenomena, such as substrate inhibi -
tion, catabolite repression or the Crabtree effect [5, 6]. 
Fed-batch cultivations are characterized by feeding nutri-
ents intermittently or continuously for microbial growth. 
The specific growth rate in fed-batch cultivations can be 
controlled by feeding a single growth-limiting nutrient 
at a desired rate. As both chemostat and fed-batch cul
-
tivations are capable of tightly maintaining the specific 
growth rate at a set value without the accumulation of 
residual substrate, key cultivation parameters obtained 
in chemostat and fed-batch cultivations can be compared 
[7].
In this study, chemostat and fed-batch cultivations were 
performed with a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain that 
has been genetically modified to express the biosynthetic 
pathway for 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP ,  C
3H6O3) 
via the intermediate β-alanine [8]. We used an improved 
small-scale parallelized continuous cultivation system 
to evaluate microbial performance for 3-HP production 
at different growth rates under carbon-limiting condi
-
tions. The best growth rate was subsequently applied to 
elucidate the effect of nitrogen- and phosphate-limiting 
conditions on product yield. The parameters assessed in 
small-scale chemostats were transferred to bench-top 
fed-batch cultivations and the microbial performance 
regarding 3-HP production was compared.
Materials and methods
Strains and maintenance
All cultivation experiments were performed with the 
genetically engineered S. cerevisiae strain ST938, previ
-
ously described for 3-HP production by Borodina et  al. 
[8]. The genes encoding the following enzymes were 
overexpressed in this strain to enable 3-HP produc
-
tion from aspartate via β-alanine: pyruvate carboxy -
lase (PYC1 , PYC2), aspartate aminotransferase (AAT2 ), 
aspartate decarboxylase (TcPAND ), β-alanine-pyruvate 
aminotransferase (BcBAPAT), and 3-hydroxypropanoate 
dehydrogenase (EcYDFG). Biomass from the S. cerevisiae 
ST938 glycerol stock was distributed on a YPD agar plate 
and incubated for 3 days at 30 °C. For pre-culture prepa
-
rations, a single colony from plate was used to inoculate 
25  mL of synthetic medium in a 250-mL baffled shake 
flask. The culture was incubated in an orbital shaker at 
30 °C degree and 250 rpm with a 2.5 cm orbit for approx
-
imately 24 h.
Media
Synthetic medium consisted of 7.5  g  L −1  (NH4)2SO4, 
14.4 g L −1  KH2PO4, 0.5 g L −1  MgSO4·7H2O and 2% glu -
cose with the addition of 2  mL trace metal and 1  mL 
vitamin solution. The trace metal solution (pH 6.0) com

3 g L−1  FeSO4·7H2O, 1 g L−1  H3BO3, 1 g L−1  MnCl2·4H2O, 
0.4  g  L −1  Na2MoO4·2H2O, 0.3  g  L −1  CoCl2·6H2O, 
0.1 g L−1  CuSO4·5H2O, 0.1 g L−1 KI and 15 g L −1 EDTA. 
The vitamin solution (pH 6.5) consisted of 50 mg L−1 bio-
tin, 200  mg  L−1 p-aminobenzoic acid, 1  g  L−1 nicotinic 
acid, 1  g  L−1 Ca-pantothenate, 1  g  L−1 pyridoxine-HCl, 
1  g  L−1 thiamine-HCl and 25  g  L −1 myo-inositol. All 
chemicals were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich. The pH of 
the medium was adjusted to 5.0 and the medium after
-
wards sterile filtrated.
Cultivations in small‑scale continuous bioreactors
The custom-made small-scale continuous cultivation sys-
tem consisted of 24 glass reactors built of 10-mL stand -
ard screw cap sample vials (VWR, Radnor, Pennsylvania, 
United States) that were placed in an aluminum block 
connected to a water bath (Julabo, Seelbach, Germany) 
for temperature control (Fig.  1). Stirring at the bottom 
of the bioreactors was carried out at 1000 rpm by using

Pennsylvania, United States) and a microplate stirrer

tion. Besides the four ports for sampling, the lid housed 
ports for aeration, feed and broth removal, and an inte

grated glass tube with an immobilized fluorescence dye 
for dissolved oxygen (DO) measurements. DO was meas
-
ured through polymer optical fibers (Presens, Regens -
burg, Germany), transferring excitation light to the 
sensor and the sensor response back to the multi-channel 
fiber optic oxygen meter (OXY-10 mini, Presens, Regens
-
burg, Germany). A 24-channel peristaltic pump was used 
to supply fresh medium to the reactors (205U multichan
-
nel cassette pump with CA8 pump head, Watson-Marlow 
Pumps Group, Rommerskirchen, Germany). In order to 
achieve different dilution rates at fixed pump rates, tubes 
with different inner diameters were incorporated into 
the system (Marprene tubing: 0.25, 0.38, 0.50, 0.63 mm; 
Watson-Marlow, Rommerskirchen, Germany). A sec

connected to the medium outlet-port of the lid, operat

vation system. For C-limited cultivation in the small-scale 
continuous bioreactors, the medium composition was 
as follows: 2  g  L
−1  (NH4)2SO4, 7.5  g  L−1 glucose mono -
hydrate, 3  g  L −1  KH2PO4, 20  g  L −1 2-(N-morpholino)
ethanesulfonic acid (MES), 0.5 g L −1  MgSO4·7H2O, with 
the addition of 2 mL trace metal and 1 mL vitamin solu -
tion, as described above. For N-limited cultivations the 
same medium composition was used with the exception 
that the glucose monohydrate concentration was 10 g L
−1 
and the ammonium sulfate ((NH 4)2SO4) concentration 
was 0.51  g  L −1. Correspondingly, P-limited conditions 
were achieved by applying 10  g  L −1 glucose monohy -
drate and a potassium dihydrogen phosphate  (KH2PO4) 
concentration of 0.08  g  L −1. The pH of each medium 
was adjusted to 6.0 via addition of 2 M sodium hydrox -
ide (NaOH), whereafter the medium was sterile filtrated. 
Each medium further contained 100  μL  L −1 Antifoam 
204 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, United States). 
Inoculation of the continuous cultures through the sam
-
ple port were performed with a syringe. The inoculum 
was 1  mL of a freshly grown S. cerevisiae strain ST938 
culture adjusted to a cell density of 1  (OD
600nm).
Cultivations in 1‑L bench‑top bioreactors
Fed-batch fermentation were carried out in 1-L  Biostat® 
Qplus bench-top reactors (Sartorius, Goettingen, Ger -
many). The cultivation regime comprised an initial batch 
phase, using 400  mL medium, followed by a second 
C- or P-limited feeding phase, adding another 400  mL 
of medium. The composition of the batch medium for 
C-limiting conditions was prepared as described above 
under section ‘medium’ . For P-limiting conditions the 
amount of potassium dihydrogen phosphate  (KH
2PO4) 
was reduced to 0.04  g  L −1. The reactors were equipped 
with pH, temperature and DO probes. The tempera -
ture was set to 30 °C and the pH was maintained at 5.5 
by means of base addition (2 N NaOH). Oxygen limita
-
tion during the cultivation was prevented by keeping dis -
solved oxygen levels above 20% air saturation, which was 
assured by increasing the agitation speed up to a maxi
-
mum of 1000 rpm and then by mixing the inlet air with 
pure oxygen if needed. The percentage of oxygen added 
to the air mix was automatically controlled by the process 
control software as response to the DO measurements.

The feed was started 1  h after carbon or phosphorus 
source depletion, indicated by decreasing  CO2 levels 
in the off-gas and an increase in pH. The growth rate of 
the exponential feed profile was set to 0.05 h −1. We used 
an exponential feed profile according to the following 
equation:
with F = feed rate (g  h
−1), a = initial feed rate (g  h −1), 
µ = specific growth rate of 0.05 h −1, and t = process time 
(h) from feed onset. The process was controlled by a 
commercial SCADA software (Lucullus PIMS, Secure -
cell AG, Switzerland). The supply of the feed was con -
trolled by means of gravimetric flow controllers. The feed 
for C-limiting conditions consisted of 400 g L
−1 glucose 
monohydrate, 10 g L −1  MgSO4·7H2O, 30 g L −1  KH2PO4 
as well as 6 mL trace element and 3 mL vitamin solution. 
The feed for P-limiting conditions was prepared  analo
-
gously to the feed for C-limiting conditions with the 
exception of 3.2  g  L
−1  KH2PO4. Each feed solution fur -
ther contained 100 μL L−1 Antifoam 204 (Sigma-Aldrich, 
St. Louis, Missouri, United States). All cultivations were 
carried out in triplicates.
Determination of cell concentration and biomass dry 
weight
The optical density  (OD600nm) of culture samples was 
measured in duplicate using a spectrophotometer (UV-
1600PC Spectrophotometer, VWR, Radnor, Pennsyl -
vania, United States) at a wavelength of 600  nm. Exact 
sample dilutions in water were determined gravimetri
-
cally. Biomass dry weight measurements were performed 
in duplicates by preparing different dilutions of a grown 
batch-culture in 15  mL-glass tubes. The respective cul
-
tures are measured for  OD600nm, then washed and after -
wards placed in an incubator at 60  °C for drying. The 
weight of the dried cell mass was determined. The calcu -
lated conversion factor for strain S. cerevisiae ST938 was 
0.423 g L
−1 per OD-unit at 660 nm.
Analysis of extracellular metabolites
The extracellular concentrations of glucose, 3-HP , glyc -
erol and ethanol were quantified by HPLC as previously 
described [8]. All compounds used as standards for cali
-
bration were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, except 3-HP 
which was purchased from Tokyo Chemicals Industry 
Co.
Sample preparation for HPLC analysis involved the sep

centrifugation of the samples for 5 min at 13,000 rpm and 
4 °C, followed by filtration (0.2 µm single-use syringe fil

Results and discussion
Improved small‑scale continuous cultivation system
In this study, we show further advancements and appli -
cation possibilities of a small-scale continuous cultiva -
tion system, previously developed by Klein et al. [2 ], for 
an increased degree of parallelization and improved 
handling as well as monitoring of the individual reac
-
tors. The key aspects of the changes made to the sys -
tem comprise an increase in the set of parallel culture 
vessels from 8 to 24 reactors and a decrease in work
-
ing volume from 10 to 6.5 mL. The present system fur -
ther consists of custom-made lids housing four fixed 
ports used for aeration, media supply, broth removal 
as well as inoculation or sampling (Fig.  1). Besides the 
four ports, an optical rod-shaped DO probe is inserted 
through the lid for DO monitoring without disturbing 
the cultivation process, and in this way replacing the 
oxygen fluorescent sensor spot of the previous set-up 
[2]. The water bath, which in the previous set-up main
-
tained a constant cultivation temperature, was replaced 
by a custom-made aluminum heating block, which is 
fused to a microplate stirrer unit. As the previous ver
-
sion of the small-scale bioreactor system was validated 
using the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe [ 2], 
we here present the improved cultivation set-up for S. 
cerevisiae cultivations.
Basic operational steps, as well as adjustments of 
dilution rates by selecting the appropriate tube diam
-
eter and pump rate of the media influx pump, were per -
formed as previously described [2 ]. Here, the weight of 
the liquid content of each bioreactor was determined 
gravimetrically at the end of the cultivation, allow
-
ing the precise calculation of the respective dilution 
rate with a 5.1% deviation. Culture broth and the reac
-
tor gas phase were both removed through the same 
port of the reactor lid using the efflux pump (Fig.  1). 
Efflux pump rates of 7.5  mL  min
−1 were used for all 
cultivation experiments. The efflux pump rate was far 
in excess of the feeding pump rate, generating a slight 
negative pressure inside the culture vessel. This pres
-
sure difference resulted in the inflow of air through the 
aeration port. The average oxygen mass transfer coef
-
ficient  kLa achieved was 110  h −1, which allowed DO 
levels well above 30% saturation throughout the culti -
vation process. The pH was not monitored online nor 
controlled during the cultivation, as the medium was a 
priori adjusted to a pH of 6.0, which resulted in a final 
pH of 5.5 in the cultivation broth. The pH was meas
-
ured at-line on a daily basis from the outflow of the 
reactors and after harvest. The pH remained constant 
as soon as steady-state was achieved and the reactor 
effluent showed a minor deviation of 0.1 pH units (data 
not shown).

Exploring 3‑HP production in small‑scale chemostats 
at different dilution rates under C‑limiting conditions
To determine the maximum specific growth rate (μ max), 
S. cerevisiae ST938 was cultivated in batch conditions 
applying excess nutrient availability. Using glucose as 
carbon source, the μ
max was 0.265 h−1, the biomass yield 
was 24.9 g mol −1, and the 3-HP carbon yield on glucose 
was 0.6 %C-mol (Table  1). In this cultivation mode, 
most of the carbon was metabolized to ethanol and  CO2 
[9], as high glycolytic fluxes in wild-type S. cerevisiae  
are strongly linked to alcoholic fermentation [10, 11]. 
Chemostat cultivations are controlled by the supply of 
a growth-limiting substrate. At steady state, wild-type 
S. cerevisiae does not produce significant quantities 
of overflow metabolites below a certain growth rate, 
marking the critical dilution rate  (D
crit  (h−1)) due to the 
lack of accumulation of carbon source. At or above this 
critical dilution rate carbon source accumulates in the 
reactor and overflow metabolism is triggered, result
-
ing in the production of various by-products, such as 
ethanol, acetate and minor quantities of organic acids 
[9, 11, 12]. Accordingly, continuous cultures were used 
to investigate the relationship between the growth rate 
and biomass-specific 3-HP product formation in S. cer
-
evisiae  ST938. The four different dilutions rates D  (h−1): 
0.04, 0.09, 0.17 and 0.21 were chosen to be below the 
μ
max of S. cerevisiae strain ST938 determined in batch 
cultivation. The biomass yield on glucose as well as the 
3-HP yield, specific 3-HP production rate, and the spe
-
cific substrate uptake rate were investigated (Fig.  2a–d, 
Table 1). All relevant cultivation parameters, i.e. yields 
and rates with the respective standard deviations, are 
summarized in Table 1 . 
The cultivation of S. cerevisiae ST938 under C-limiting 
conditions showed a switch from predominantly fer
-
mentative metabolism observed in batch mode to a res -
piratory metabolism in chemostats, which is reflected in 
higher biomass yields as well as in negligible ethanol and 
glycerol formation (Table 1). Furthermore, minor quanti
-
ties of residual glucose below 0.1  mM were detected in 
the samples taken from the efflux of the different reac
-
tors, verifying the cultures to be glucose-limited. Car -
bon-limited conditions found in steady-state chemostat 
cultures seemed to promote the formation of 3-HP , as 
the yields of this product were 20- to 25-fold higher than 
the yield determined in batch culture (Table  1). This is 
most likely due to the more efficient conversion of carbon 
into energy in form of ATP during respiration in com
-
parison to fermentation in batch cultures. Interestingly, 
the cultivations of S. cerevisiae ST938 under C-limiting 
conditions revealed that with declining specific growth 
rates a constant increase in 3-HP carbon yields could be 
observed, with the highest 3-HP yield of 16.6 %C-mol 
observed at a dilution rate of 0.04 h
−1 (Fig. 2a). The 3-HP 
yield on biomass is tenfold higher than the yield in batch 
cultures and increased more than twofold from 0.19 to 
0.43 g gCDW
−1 by lowering the dilution rate from 0.21 to 
0.04 h−1 (Table 1). The maximum specific productivity for 
3-HP of approximately 0.50 mmol gCDW−1 h−1 was seen 
at dilution rates of 0.17 and 0.21  h −1, which is roughly 
fourfold higher than measured in batch cultivations 
(Fig. 2c, Table 1). As expected, the specific glucose uptake 
rate  (q
S) increased with higher dilution rates from 0.51 to

2.1 mmol gCDW −1 h−1 (Fig.  2d). These values are up to 
20-fold below the maximum specific glucose uptake rate 
of 10.7 mmol gCDW −1 h−1 observed at µ max under glu -
cose-limited growth conditions in batch mode (Table  1). 
Values obtained for the specific substrate uptake rate and 
biomass yield at a dilution rate of 0.09 h
−1 (Table 1) were 
in agreement with data from chemostat cultivations with 
wild-type S. cerevisiae at a dilution rate of 0.10 h
−1, stat-
ing 1.1 and 1.25 mmol gCDW −1 h−1 as well as 0.49 g g −1, 
respectively [13, 14]. It has been found that the biomass 
yield per substrate increases with increasing dilution 
rates, for wild-type S. cerevisiae, however, this param
-
eter is generally constant below  Dcrit as long as mainte -
nance metabolism does constitute a considerable carbon 
sink reducing the biomass yield at low dilution rates [11, 
12, 15]. In case of S. cerevisiae strain ST938, however, it 
seemed that carbon, which was not directed towards bio

formation of both 3-HP and by-products.
To conclude, differences experienced in continuous cul

tures at different dilution rates as well as in comparison 
to similar set-ups with S. cerevisiae wild-type suggest that 
the integrated biosynthetic pathway to produce 3-HP has 
a tremendous impact on yeast physiology, which is pre

sumably amplified by adaptive stress responses. Finally, 
C-limited chemostat cultivation at the lowest dilution

previously been proven to be favorable for the production 
of various native and non-native metabolites in different 
organisms [16–21]. Here, the corresponding cultivations 
under nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) limitation were 
investigated in the small-scale continuous cultivation sys
-
tem (Fig. 1) with a set dilution rate of 0.04 h−1, which had 
previously resulted in the highest carbon yields of 3-HP 
under C-limited conditions (Table  1). The parameters 
and respective standard deviations from N- and P-lim
-
ited cultivations of yeast strain ST938 are summarized in 
Table 2.
For N- and P-limited cultivation conditions, no resid
-
ual ammonium or phosphate were detected in the sam -
ples taken from the efflux of the different reactors, 
verifying the cultures to be limited with respect to the 
corresponding substrate limitation (Table  2). However, 
minor quantities of residual glucose in the range of 0.63 
and 0.19  mM were detected under N- and P-limitation 
(Table 2). During C-limitation the residual glucose levels 
were well below 0.1  mM (Table  2). Cultivations apply
-
ing  N- and P-limitations revealed a 3-HP yield of 17.7 
and 21.1 %C-mol, respectively, displaying a significantly 
higher value under P-limited conditions compared to 
the 3-HP carbon yield of 16.6 %C-mol calculated for 
C-limited cultivation conditions (Tables  1, 2). Simi
-
larly, the specific productivity for 3-HP was significantly 
increased for N- and P-limited cultivations revealing 
values of 0.22 and 0.23 mmol gCDW
−1 h−1 in compari -
son to 0.17  mmol  gCDW −1 h −1 reached in C-limited 
cultures. Moreover, the 3-HP yields on biomass showed 
comparable values of 0.43 and 0.44 g gCDW
−1 for C- and 
N-limiting conditions, however, in case of P-limitation, 
an increased yield of 0.50  g  gCDW
−1 was observed. 
Due to the overall low concentrations of by-products 
quantified, these are negligible (Table  2). The values for 
the specific substrate uptake rate  (q
S) for C- and P-lim -
itation were comparable and a slightly elevated value of 
0.61  mmol  gCDW
−1 h −1 was obtained under N-limited 
conditions. Biomass yields per substrate revealed for 
N- and P-limited conditions similar values of 72.4 and 
75.2  g  mol
−1, respectively. Compared to the biomass 
yield of 78.4  g  mol −1 achieved under C-limited condi -
tions, these values are similar. Our study supports the 
rationale that higher product yields per substrate were 
achieved under N- and P-limiting conditions. Conse
-
quently, it appears that a higher specific substrate uptake 
rate in case of N-limitation combined with the minimal 
formation of by-products ultimately favored product for
-
mation. Under P-limiting conditions the least amounts 
of by-products were formed, which could favor product 
synthesis. It can further be speculated that some meta
-
bolic changes possibly lead to a lowered amount of car -
bon being released as  CO2.
In summary, chemostat cultivations under N- and 
P-limitation revealed increased 3-HP yields and specific 
production rates compared to C-limited conditions, with 
P-limitation enabling the highest product yields.
Transferability of the physiological parameters measured 
in small‑scale chemostats to fed‑batch cultures in 1‑L 
bench‑top bioreactors under C‑ and P‑limiting conditions
Since this study further aimed at assessing transfer -
ability and comparability of the physiological parameters 
measured under different cultivation conditions, the 
cultivation parameters obtained from the C- and P-lim
-
iting conditions determined in chemostat cultures were 
transferred to 1-L stirred bench-top reactors running in 
fed-batch mode. The concept of this approach was there
-
fore to keep key conditions and parameters constant for 
chemostat and fed-batch cultures to assure comparabil
-
ity. These conditions comprised (i) the same C:P ratio 
as applied in P-limiting chemostat cultivations, (ii) the 
identical process conditions like pH and temperature, 
and (iii) the same specific growth rates as applied in che
-
mostats, achieved through an exponential feed profile. 
To optimize the product titer, the parameters with the 
maximal product yield per substrate from the chemostat 
experiments (D = 0.04  h
−1) under C- and P-limitation 
were chosen for the transfer to the fed-batch system.

Due to technical restrictions in the set-up, fed-batch cul -
tivations were carried out at a growth rate of 0.05  h −1, 
which is slightly higher compared to the set dilution 
rate of 0.04 h −1 in chemostat cultivations. The fed-batch 
cultivation consisted of an initial batch phase to gener -
ate biomass followed by an exponential, nutrient limited 
feeding phase to control the growth rate. Only the feed
-
ing phase was considered relevant for the transferability 
assessment of the parameters obtained from the continu
-
ous cultivation system, since solely during this phase the 
substrate concentration was controlling and thus limiting 
microbial growth. The fed-batch cultivation profiles of S. 
cerevisiae ST938 applying C- and P-limiting conditions 
are shown in Fig.  3, and the corresponding cultivation 
parameters with their respective standard deviation are 
summarized in Table 3. 
The biomass yield observed in the fed-batch cul
-
tures was 77.9 and 67.7 g mol −1 for C- and P-limitation, 
respectively. The biomass yield for C-limited cultiva -
tions was comparable among chemostat and fed-batch 
operation, whereas for P-limitation, a slightly decreased 
biomass yield was observed during fed-batch operation 
(Tables  2, 3), which is within the standard deviations 
observed for both biomass yields. The carbon yield per 
substrate for 3-HP was 15.9% for C-limitation, which is 
almost identical compared to the value calculated in the 
chemostat system (Fig.  4a). The 3-HP yields determined 
in this study are further in close agreement to a carbon 
yield per substrate of 14% obtained in previous C-limited 
fed-batch studies at pH  5.0 with a S. cerevisiae strain 
engineered to use the β-alanine pathway [8] and of 13% 
with a S. cerevisiae utilizing the malonyl-CoA reductase-
dependent pathway [22]. Higher 3-HP carbon yields per 
substrate via the β-alanine pathway were determined in 
studies with Escherichia coli stating a value of 42% in fed-
batch cultivations on glucose [23].
For P-limiting conditions, however, our study revealed 
a considerable increase in 3-HP carbon yield of 25.6% 
(Fig. 4a). The observed 3-HP yields on biomass were 0.38 
and 0.65  g  gCDW
−1 for C- and P-limiting conditions, 
respectively. For C-limitation this confirmed the values 
observed in the chemostat set-up (Fig.  4b). Due to the 
increase in yield of 3-HP per substrate under P-limiting 
conditions and the slight decrease in biomass yield per

substrate at the same time, the yield of 3-HP per biomass 
was significantly increased compared to the chemostat 
experiment. In contrast to the cultivations carried out 
in chemostats, no significant accumulation of ethanol or 
glycerol was detected in fed-batch cultivations. A closed 
carbon balance for C- and P-limiting conditions indicated 
that no relevant amounts of other (by-)products were 
formed (Table 3). This difference in by-product spectrum 
might explain the increase in 3-HP yield per glucose.
In comparison to the cultivations conducted in chemo
-
stats, the specific glucose uptake rates determined in fed-
batch cultures show considerably higher values of 0.75 
and 0.77 mmol gCDW
−1 h−1 for C- and P-limiting con -
ditions, respectively. As mentioned above, the set point 
for the exponential factor of the feed profile was set to 
0.05 h
−1 and varied up to 0.059 h−1, resulting in a 30–45% 
higher specific growth rate in fed-batch cultivations 
compared to the chemostat experiments with 0.04  h
−1 
(Table 3), causing increased specific glucose uptake rates. 
Nonetheless, for C-limited fermentations, the biomass 
yield on glucose was comparable between chemostat and 
fed-batch cultivation. Similarly, the specific 3-HP produc
-
tion rates were elevated in fed-batch cultivations, with 
0.24  mmol  gCDW
−1 h −1 and 0.38  mmol  gCDW −1 h −1, 
respectively. 3-HP yields per substrate were comparable 
between chemostat and fed-batch cultivation, suggesting 
yields to be a robust cultivation parameter that is resist
-
ant to perturbations induced by smaller fluctuations in 
the cultivation set-up. No residual phosphate, as well as 
glucose, was detected in the samples taken from the dif
-
ferent reactors for P-limiting conditions, confirming the 
cultures to be limited with respect to the corresponding 
limitation. Similarly, for C-limitation no residual glucose 
was detected in the samples.
The here presented improvements of a small-scale che
-
mostat system, previously developed by Klein et  al. [2], 
comprised among others an increase in the number of 
reactors to 24 and a reduction in cultivation volume to 
6.5 mL. This increased degree of parallelization makes the 
system a suitable high-throughput screening tool, as vari
-
ous comparable small-scale chemostat systems operate 
with higher working volumes and with a lower number of 
reactors: The continuous parallel shaken bioreactor (Cos
-
Bios) system uses six [24] respectively eight parallel cul -
ture vessels with a culture volume of 20–25 mL [25]. The 
for continuous cultivations modified single-use stirred-
tank bioreactor system (bioREACTOR, 2mag AG) oper
-
ates with eight parallel reactors at a working volume of 
10 mL [26]. The mini-chemostat (MC) system developed 
by Bergenholm et al. [27] comprises 16 parallel reactors 
and requires a working volume of 40 mL. Our system is 
therefore well applicable for the simple and cost-effective 
screening of microbial performance in continuous mode. 
It could be of relevance, however, to further extent the 
system by monitoring additional parameters, such as 
exhaust gas, to allow a detailed analysis of the carbon 
distribution, which is of particular importance for physi
-
ological strain characterizations.
As our study suggested N- and P-limitation to be 
favorable for 3-HP formation in S. cerevisiae, future 
experiments could involve further screening of growth 
rates with N- and P-limitation applied in order to find 
the optimum 3-HP production with each respective limi
-
tation. Our study further showed the transferability of

cultivations. This deems only be feasible if no toxic or 
inhibiting compounds accumulate during the fed-batch 
cultivation, since physiological parameters would change 
over time and deviate from the acquired parameters in 
chemostats. As a general approach, chemostat experi
-
ments can serve as a tool for investigating the influence 
of a potential toxic or inhibiting compound by adding 
the substance to the feed itself. Since all other parame
-
ters are constant, the influence of the compound and its 
concentration can directly be assessed and evaluated. In 
our study, there was no by-product formation detected 
in fed-batch cultivations and a presumably similar stress 
response was induced due to weak acids, which allowed 
physiological conditions in small-scale chemostats to 
resemble to those in fed-batch conditions.
In summary, this study showed that the concept of C- 
and P-limiting conditions for the production of 3-HP 
was investigated in a novel parallelized chemostat cul
-
tivation system and could successfully be transferred to 
1-L bench-top bioreactors operating in fed-batch mode. 
Therefore, physiological parameters acquired in che
-
mostats can be used for the design and performance 
assessment of fed-batch cultivations using yield-based 
parameters for the process set-up.
Conclusion
This study demonstrates the concept of transferring rel -
evant cultivation parameters from a parallelized small-
scale chemostat system to a bench-top fed-batch process 
to produce 3-hydroxypropionic acid (3-HP) in engi
-
neered S. cerevisiae, where a suitable growth rate clearly 
functions as a robust key parameter for process transfer 
allowing comparable product yields in both systems. The 
observed physiological performance of engineered S. 
cerevisiae ST938 in chemostats under substrate limiting 
conditions revealed the highest 3-HP yield from glucose 
with 21.6% under P-limitation at the lowest growth rate 
(0.04 h
−1) tested. To our best knowledge, this is so far the 
highest yield from carbon achieved with S. cerevisiae for 
3-HP production as well as the first study that shows that 
P-limitation has a beneficial effect on 3-HP yield.
Furthermore, it was shown that these parameters can 
be used for process development in industrially relevant 
fed-batch applications, as demonstrated in the reproduc
-
ible production performance of S. cerevisiae in fed-batch 
conditions under C- and P-limitation.
