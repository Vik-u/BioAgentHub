Abstract: Malic enzyme (ME), a key enzyme involved in various metabolic pathways,
catalyzes the oxidative decarboxylation of malate to generate pyruvate, CO2, and NADPH.
This enzyme plays essential roles in plant growth, development, and stress responses. In
this study, 13 maize ME genes were identified by performing homologous sequence align-
ment using the sequences of the Arabidopsis ME gene family as references. Chromosomal
localization analysis demonstrated that ME genes were not detected on chromosomes 9 and
10, whereas the remaining eight chromosomes exhibited an uneven distribution of these
genes. Phylogenetic analysis indicated a high degree of conservation between maize ME
genes and their orthologs in teosinte (Zea luxurians L.) throughout the evolutionary history
of Poaceae crops. Furthermore, cis-acting element analysis of promoters demonstrated that
members of the maize ME gene family harbor regulatory elements associated with stress
responses, phytohormones signaling, and light responsiveness, which suggests their poten-
tial role in abiotic stress adaptation. Expression profiling under stress conditions revealed
differential expression levels of maize ME genes, with ZmME13 emerging as a promising
candidate gene for enhancing stress resistance. These results lay a solid foundation for
further investigation into the biological functions of the maize ME gene family.

1. Introduction
Maize (Zea mays L.) is the most widely cultivated food crop worldwide, and it is also
an important source of animal feed and raw materials for industrial processing [1]. During
the growth of maize, high temperatures, droughts, and salty soils can significantly impact
its yields [2]. Drought, considered the most significant abiotic stress factor, would hinder
maize’s normal growth and development by disrupting its normal physiological processes,
ultimately resulting in severe yield losses [3]. The global decrease in maize yield due to
drought is about 15% each year [ 4]. Prolonged drought directly interferes with various
physiological indicators of maize, forcing the acceleration of various physiological and
biochemical reactions in the maize reproductive process, shortening the maize growth
cycle, resulting in significantly smaller cobs and reduced dry matter accumulation, and
ultimately leading to a significant decline in maize quality and yield. In extreme cases, it
can even lead to a significant reduction in maize yields as well as crop failure [ 5,6]. At
present, countries around the world seek solutions to their dilemmas through research

on dry farming, water-saving agriculture, drought-resistant breeding, and the traditional
genetic breeding technology of maize. Although drought-resistant maize improvement
has played a role, the cultivation of new drought-resistant maize varieties, is needed
to realize an effective solution to the problem. For high and stable yields of maize, it
is necessary to select and breed drought-resistant and high-temperature-resistant maize
materials. Research on drought and heat tolerant maize varieties should aim to understand
the molecular mechanisms of its drought and heat tolerance, particularly focusing on the
synergistic regulation of stress-responsive genes and epigenetic adaptations during the
entire maize reproductive period. The flowering, pollen dispersal, and grouting periods are
the most vulnerable to drought and high temperatures [7], during which high temperatures
can lead to decreased pollen viability or abortion, shriveling of filaments, and reduced
kernel fullness and quality. Under high temperatures and drought stress, stress response
phenomena occur in plants, and there are many genes whose expression is repressed or
stimulated, i.e., up-regulated or down-regulated [ 8,9]. Given the significant impact of
drought on maize, understanding the underlying physiological and molecular mechanisms
is crucial. Malic acid and its related enzymes, such as malic enzyme, have been shown to
be involved in plant stress responses [10,11] which provides a potential research direction
for exploring maize drought tolerance.
Malic acid (MA) plays an important function in plant growth and development [12,13]. In
plant cells, malic acid is a substance that links multiple metabolisms in different organelles and
is involved in the regulation of a variety of metabolic reactions. Through malate synthesis and
oxidation reactions, cells function as reducing power carriers and carbon carriers. The enzymes
that catalyze the synthesis and oxidation of malic acid are malate synthase, malic enzyme and
malate dehydrogenase [14]. Based on the coenzyme factors, plant malic enzymes can be di-
vided into NAD-dependent malic enzymes and NADP-ME [15]. Malic enzyme is an important
precursor for producing ketone bodies [16]. Studies have shown that plant malic enzymes not
only play a significant role in key metabolic pathways such as photosynthesis and respiration,
but also regulate plantgrowth and development [17], potentially related to plant defense
mechanisms [11,18]. Ice plum contains the NADP-ME gene [19], which is induced under
NaCl stressed conditions. The activities of both NAD-ME and NADP-ME in the plant also
increase under stress [20]. Rice (Oryza sativa L.) has two NADP-ME genes that are induced
under NaCl, NaHCO3, and Na2CO3 stressed conditions, with their activities accordingly
increasing. Overexpression of these genes in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana increases the
plant’s salt tolerance [ 21,22]. Under drought conditions, the expression of NADP-ME
genes is also affected by drought stress, but their response patterns differ [23–25]. Plants
are exposed to seasonal temperature variations that significantly affect their biochemical
processes. Elevated temperatures can cause the thermal deactivation of enzymes, resulting
in the structural disassembly of enzymatic systems and cellular dehydration. In contrast,
suboptimal low temperatures decrease root vitality, protoplasmic fluidity, and NADP-ME
activity, while concurrently inducing chlorophyll degradation via photooxidative mecha-
nisms. These temperature-induced disturbances collectively disrupt metabolic homeostasis
in plants [26]. NADP-ME in wheat leaf increases gradually under 4 in 24 h. However, the
index of photosynthesis does not show the same trend. This means that the activity of
NADP-ME seriously affected by low temperatures. The enzyme responds to stress at the
protein level. Through RT-PCR study,TaNADP-ME1 and TaNADP-ME2 showed the same
variation trend, which increased after 3 h of declining under low-temperature stress. This
evidence indicates that cold stress can induce the expression of the NADP-ME gene, which
has a close relationship with the cold resistance of plants [27].
In this study, the maize inbred line B73 was selected as the research subject. Bioinfor-
matics approaches were employed to systematically analyze the physicochemical prop-
Plants 2025, 14, 1603 3 of 19
erties, phylogenetic relationships, chromosomal localization and collinearity of the ME
gene family. These extensive data resources establish a robust theoretical foundation and
provide critical support for further exploration of the functional roles of drought tolerance-
associated genes within theME gene family in maize. Through this integrated methodology,
the research aims to deepen the understanding of plant drought resistance mechanisms,
identify novel molecular targets for stress adaptation, and ultimately drive revolutionary
advancements in crop improvement and agricultural productivity.
2. Results
2.1. Identification of the Maize ME Gene Family
Based on sequence information from Uniport for six MEs (NADP-ME and NAD-ME)
in Arabidopsis thaliana, a bioinformatics analysis was performed to study their protein
sequence characteristics. BLAST searches were conducted to identify ZmME gene family
members in the protein sequences of maize, teosinte (Zea spp.), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.),
rice (Oryza sativa L.), barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), millet (Seteria italica L.), and proso millet
(Panicum meliaceous L.). Using the local BLASTP v.2.6.0 tool (E < 1 × 10−10, identify > 50%),
13 ZmME gene family members were identified and analyzed as ZmME1~ZmME13 from
the maize genome (Table 1). The sequence properties of these members indicate a range of
lengths from 1034 to 54,178 bp for the genes and 414 to 1932 codons for the coding regions,
corresponding to protein molecular weights ranging from 15,622.11 kDa to 70,694.85 kDa
and amino acid counts of 178 to 644. ZmME5 contains only 178 amino acids (the shortest),
while ZmME10 is the longest at 644 amino acids. The theoretical isoelectric point (pI)
ranges from 5.22 to 9.2, with ZmME1, ZmME5, ZmME7, and ZmME8 having pI values
above 7 (basic proteins), while the remaining members are acidic proteins. The overall
hydrophobicity coefficient spans a range of −0.361~0.291, the average hydrophilicity
coefficient values are consistently less than zero, indicating kinetically favorable properties
for these proteins to bind water.

2.2. Chromosomal Localization and Collinearity Analysis
The collinearity analysis results demonstrated that ME genes were not detected on
chromosomes 9 and 10, whereas the remaining eight chromosomes exhibited an uneven dis-
tribution of these genes (Figure 1A). Among these chromosomes, chromosome 3 contained
four ZmME genes, while the others carried one to two ZmME genes each (Figure 1B). This
suggests that ZmME gene family members are unevenly dispersed across chromosomes.
Additionally, 16 collinear relationships were identified between the 13ZmME genes and
Plants 2025, 14, 1603 4 of 19
12 ZxME genes (Figure 1A). Comparative analysis indicated that ZmME genes and ZxME
genes exhibited minimal accumulated variations, sharing numerous conserved features
and demonstrating high evolutionary conservation.

2.3. Phylogenetic Analysis of Gene Families
The results revealed that the 82 ME proteins were classified into eight subfamilies,
with an uneven distribution of ZmME genes across these subfamilies (Figure 2). Subfamily
I, the smallest group comprising only eight members, harbored the highest number of
ZmME genes (three). In contrast, subfamilies II, III, IV , and VI each contained a single
ZmME gene, whereas subfamilies V , VII, and VIII exhibited twoZmME genes per subfamily.
Notably, phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that maize ME proteins exhibited the closest
evolutionary relationship to and highest homology with those of teosinte ME suggesting
functional conservation between maize and teosinte.

2.4. Conserved Motifs, Structural Domains and Gene Structure Analysis of Gene Family Members
An analysis of the systematics of ZmME gene family members revealed (Figure 3) that
13 ZmME genes exhibited 1–10 conserved motifs, and these 13 ZmME genes were divided
into three major branches. In the first branch, ZmME5 contained only one conserved motif
Motif6, while ZmME1 contained only one conserved motif Motif10. The second branch
included ZmME7 with two conserved motifs Motif2 and Motif1 and ZmME4 with two con-
served motifs Motif8 and Motif3. In the third branch, ZmME2 had three conserved motif
Motif2, Motif1, and Motif8, while the other developmental groups exhibited high similarity
in their conserved motif. Conserved motifs are typically associated with protein functions.
These motifs’ sequence information was submitted to the PFAM database for functional
queries. The results demonstrated that the majority of genes were associated with oxidore-
ductase activity (GO:0016616) and exhibited malic enzyme activity (GO:0004470), indicating
that these motifs play a pivotal role in the catalytic process of malic enzyme generation. The
results indicate that the predicted conserved motif within the same developmental group
Plants 2025, 14, 1603 6 of 19
of the ZmME gene family exhibit a high degree of identity and share relatively similar
genetic structures.

2.5. Analysis of Promoter Cis-Acting Elements of Maize ME Family Members
The bioinformatic analysis of cis-regulatory elements in the 13 ZmME genes identified
29 functionally significant elements within this gene family. (Figure 4). In maize, the
promoters of these 13 ZmME genes contain varying numbers of functional elements such
as growth hormone response elements TGA-box, GARE, and GCC-box, TGA-box regulates
the expression of antioxidant enzyme genes (e.g., glutathione transferase) to mitigate
oxidative damage. GARE controls stem elongation-related genes (e.g., GA20ox), promoting
internode growth and flowering. GCC-box enhances stress resilience by enabling EIN3
binding under hypoxia or salt stress to activate stress-responsive genes. Integration of
Plants 2025, 14, 1603 7 of 19
TGA-box and GCC-box coordinates plant adaptation to multiple stressors, abscisic acid
trans-acting elements, and light response elements. Additionally, apart from the basic
promoter elements such as CAAT boxes and TAAT boxes, they also possess multiple
stress-related responsive elements, including ABA response elements, defense and stress
response elements, heat response elements, cold response elements, and motifs associated
with abiotic stress-induced responses. Furthermore, these promoters exhibit binding sites
specifically related to drought-induction processes. These findings suggest that the ZmME
gene family may play significant roles in developmental processes, such as regulating seed
maturation and storage reserve accumulation, root elongation and morphogenesis, and
reproductive growth, further indicating the critical regulatory functions of ME genes under
adverse environmental conditions.

2.6. Expression Analysis of Maize Malic Enzyme Gene Under Abiotic Stresses
To investigate the expression patterns of the ZmME gene family under various abiotic
stress conditions, this study examined the expression levels of different ZmME genes in
seedlings at 42 ◦C high-temperature stress, 4 ◦C low-temperature stress, 250 mmol NaCl
salinity stress, 20% PEG polyethylene glycol stress, and drought treatments at time points of
0 h (CK), 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h. Table 2 Primer information used in the transcriptional
expression level detection of ZmMEgenes. The results showed that all five types of abiotic
stress induced distinct differential effects on the expression of ZmME genes.

2.6.1. Drought Stress Treatments
To investigate the drought responsiveness of the ZmME gene family, we evaluated
the expression profiles of ZmME genes in maize leaf tissue under drought stress (Figure 5,
Table S1). Thirteen ZmME genes displayed distinct temporal induction patterns, with
fold-change increases ranging from 9.14 to 50.90 relative to the control. ZmME13 showed
the highest level of expression at 50.90-fold induction. There was no significant difference in
expression after stress at the 1 h time point. However, at the 3 h time point, the expression
levels significantly deviated from those observed at the 0 h condition (p < 0.05), and this
deviation became highly significant by the 6 h to 24 h time points compared to the control
(p < 0.01). These results indicate that ZmME genes are strongly induced in response to
drought stress.

2.6.2. High-Temperature Stress at 42 ◦C
Under 42 ◦C elevated temperature stress, the expression levels of ZmME1-13 genes
increased from 7.07- to 57.49-fold compared to the control (Figure 6, Table S2). ZmME13
exhibited the highest level of expression at a 57.49-fold induction. There was no significant
difference in expression after stress at the 1 h time point. However, at the 3 h time point, the
expression levels significantly deviated from those observed at the 0 h condition (p < 0.05),
and this deviation became highly significant by the 6 h–24 h time points compared to the
control (p < 0.01). These results suggest that ZmME genes are strongly induced in response
to elevated temperature stress.

2.6.3. 4 ◦C Low-Temperature Stress Treatment
Under 4 ◦C cold stress treatment, the expression levels of ZmME1-13 increased from
7.98-fold to 45.19-fold compared to the control (Figure 7, Table S3). The highest fold increase
was observed in ZmME7, reaching up to 45.19-fold relative to the control. No significant
changes were observed after stress at the 1 h time point. However, there were significant
differences between expression levels at 3 h and 12 h and those at 0 h ( p < 0.05). At 6 h
and 24 h, highly significant differences were observed in expression levels compared to the
control (p < 0.01). Based on these findings, it can be inferred that ZmME genes are involved
in the cold response of seedling maize plants.

2.6.4. 20% PEG Stress Treatment
Under the 20% PEG treatment, the significant induction of ZmME genes was observed.
The expression levels of ZmME1-13 were, respectively, increased to 5.93-fold and up to
47.75-fold compared to the control (Figure 8, Table S4). Among these, ZmME13 exhibited
the highest level of expression, reaching 47.75-fold relative to the control. No significant
changes were observed after treatment at the 1 h time point. However, a significant differ-
ence was detected between expression levels at 3 h and those at 0 h (p < 0.05). Furthermore,
highly significant differences were observed in expression levels between the 6 h to 24 h
treatments and the control (p < 0.01). These findings suggest that ZmME is also induced by
PEG stress and shows a time-dependent pattern of expression.

2.6.5. 250 mmol·L−1 NaCl Stress Treatments
After treatment with 250 mmol·L−1 NaCl, the expression levels of ZmME ranged from
5.29-fold to 47.20-fold compared to the control (Figure 9, Table S5). Among these, ZmME13
exhibited the highest expression level at various time points: up to 47.20-fold relative to
the control after treatment. For all other members in this group, their expression levels
progressively declined over time, with significant differences observed between expression
values at different time points and those measured at 0 h ( p < 0.01). Notably, ZmME12
exhibited the highest level of expression among these genes across the entire stress period.
After exposure to high salt stress for 24 h, its expression level significantly decreased back to
baseline levels comparable to the untreated samples (p < 0.01). These findings suggest that
ZmME is also induced by high salt stress and undergoes a dynamic pattern of expression
over different time periods under such treatment conditions.

3. Discussion
ME is widely distributed in animals, plants, and microorganisms [ 28,29]. As a key
enzyme participating in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, it plays essential roles in organ-
ismal metabolism. In plants, the malic enzyme is involved in multiple critical metabolic
pathways, including photosynthesis, respiration, and lipid biosynthesis [30]. It contributes
significantly to maintaining cellular osmotic potential, stabilizing cytoplasmic pH, and reg-
ulating ion uptake balance in plant roots, making it one of the most vital enzymes in plant
life activities. Therefore, investigating the identification of the ZmME gene family and its
gene expression under stress conditions is crucial for providing important genetic resources
for drought-resistant maize breeding. In this study, we successfully identified 13ZmME
gene family members using bioinformatics approaches based on known protein sequences
of six Arabidopsis ME genes. Beyond maize, the ME gene family has been characterized
in other species. According to the latest reports from NCBI’s Genome Data Viewer, rice
contains 28 ME genes, whereas wheat harbors 39 ME genes, and they can have the same
or different responses to different stresses. This may be related to the physicochemical
properties of ME genes and the fact that each member assumes a different function in
metabolism [31,32]. Chromosomal localization and covariance studies revealed that most
of the genes were located on chromosomes, and the distribution of the chromosomes was
shown to be uneven. The ZmME gene was present on only eight chromosomes and was
unevenly distributed, but no significant correlation was obtained between the chromosome
Plants 2025, 14, 1603 13 of 19
length and the number, while some of the genes were concentrated at either top or bottom
of the chromosome. In the ME gene family, distinct chromosomal localization patterns were
observed across species. Four NADP-ME isoforms designated MeNADP-ME1 to MeNADP-
ME4 were identified in cassava Manihot esculenta, with MeNADP-ME1 and MeNADP-ME2
mapped to chromosome 16, while MeNADP-ME3 and MeNADP-ME4 were localized to
chromosomes 11 and 4, respectively [ 33]. Similarly, pepper Capsicum annuum harbors
five NADP-ME genes, CaNADP-ME1 to CaNADP-ME5, distributed across chromosomes 3,
5, 8, 9, and 12 [34]. This differential chromosomal distribution of ME family members in
both species suggests potential functional diversification through sub functionalization or
neofunctionalization, possibly reflecting distinct regulatory mechanisms and synergistic
roles in plant metabolic processes.
Phylogenetic analysis of the ZmME gene family revealed eight sub-families. While
the first subfamily contained three ZmME genes, the remaining subfamilies each harbored
one to two ZmME genes. Notably, phylogenetic analysis revealed that malic enzyme genes
from maize exhibit the closest evolutionary relationship with their orthologs in teosinte,
suggesting conserved functional roles in these closely related species. Thirty-five plant
NADP-MEs were classed into four distinct groups, forming the resulting phylogenetic
tree: Group I consists of dicot cytosolic proteins, Group II consists of monocots, Group
III encompasses dicot plastidic NADP-MEs, and Group IV includes dicot and monocot
cytosolic proteins. (Fu, Zhen-Yan et al.). ZmcytME, C4(3)-NADP-ME and OscytME3 are
classified as Group IV . The discrepancy with the other monocotsNADP-ME indicates there
are two independent evolution branches of NADP-ME in monocots. One branch represents
the evolution of C4 cytosolic isoforms and the other represents the evolution of plastidic
isoforms [35].
Through comprehensive analysis of conserved motifs, structural domains, and gene
architectures of ZmME family members, we ultimately classified the 13 ZmME gene mem-
bers into four subfamilies. The investigation of the conserved motifs revealed that ME
proteins from identical subfamilies share most identical motifs while certain motifs exhib-
ited specific spatial distributions restricted to identical motifs. In Arabidopsis, AtNAD-ME1
and AtNAD-ME2 were found to have 19 exons, and AtNAD-ME3 and AtNAD-ME4 have
18 exons [36]. The presence and distribution of exons and introns also play key roles in the
evolution of gene families [37]. In this study, among the 13 ZmME gene, ZmME5 has only
one motif, while the remaining genes contain multiple motifs, possibly due to mutations or
duplication of conserved domains during evolution, which may enhance its binding affinity
to downstream genes. We inferred that member within the same subfamily consistently
shared identical conserved motif compositions, suggesting potential functional overlap
and complementarity.
Cis-acting elements are critical regulatory components governing gene expression,
modulating responses to developmental processes and environmental stimuli [38]. Pro-
moter regions of ZmME family genes harbor diverse functional elements, including core
promoter motifs (e.g., CAAT-box and TATA-box), as well as hormone- and stress-responsive
elements such as ABA-responsive elements, defense/stress-responsive elements, heat- and
cold-responsive elements. Similarly, hormone-responsive elements and ABA-responsive
elements were found in bell peppers. Nevertheless, ABRE (ACGT-containing abscisic acid
response element), which is involved in abscisic acid (ABA) responsiveness, was the cis-
regulatory element that exerted the most remarkable positive effect on CaNADP-ME4 [34].
Additionally, abiotic stress- and light-responsive elements are widely distributed in ZmME
promoters. Previous studies have demonstrated a significant positive correlation between
upstream promoter regions and their associated cis-acting elements [ 39–41], indicating
that ZmME gene family members likely participate in light signaling, stress adaptation,
Plants 2025, 14, 1603 14 of 19
and hormonal regulation. Notably, as Poaceae members, both maize and rice exhibit en-
riched light-responsive elements in ZmME promoter regions, suggesting these elements
play pivotal roles in maize growth and non-stress physiological processes. Intriguingly,
distinct combinatorial patterns of cis-acting elements among genes—such as ZmME5 and
ZmME13—may reflect functional specialization. For instance, genes containing “anaerobic
induction elements” might be activated under hypoxic conditions (e.g., waterlogging),
while those with “endosperm expression elements” could regulate seed development or
storage compound biosynthesis. ZmME13 harbors drought-inducible MYB-binding sites in
its promoter, which likely drives its highly induced expression under drought stress. These
findings collectively underscore the functional importance of ZmME genes in plant growth
and environmental adaptation.
Expression pattern analysis provides a crucial foundation for determining gene func-
tions [42] in the ZmME gene under different conditions of stress treatment. Plants possess a
sophisticated stress signal transduction system that activates their intrinsic defense mecha-
nisms through hierarchical signaling cascades when subjected to external stresses. Most
stress signals can induce the expression of defense-related genes [ 43]. For instance, ex-
pression profiling of the WRKY gene family in maize has revealed its expression patterns
under abiotic stresses, offering new insights into the signaling pathways involved in maize
responses to abiotic stress [ 44]. Overexpression of NADP-ME in rice enhances the salt
tolerance of transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings. Moreover, the NADP-ME activity in leaves
and roots also increases with the increase in the NaCl concentration. Similarly, the activity
of NAD-ME and NADP-ME in the leaves of eucalyptus increased under salt stress, which
provided a reducing power for the cells to resist salt stress. We speculate that ME is mainly
used in three ways after being induced by salt stress. The enhanced activity of NADP-ME
confers salt stress tolerance through three distinct mechanisms: First, it elevates NADPH
production, which scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) to mitigate oxidative damage,
second, the generated NADP serves as a cofactor for osmo-protectant biosynthesis, while
the concomitant accumulation of malate the enzymatic product of NADP-ME paradoxically
exacerbates osmotic stress under saline conditions. Finally, this malate synthesis pathway
contributes to cytosolic pH homeostasis by counteracting the alkalinization induced by salt
stress [17]. Northern and Western blot data indicated that in aloe, the NADP-ME gene was
strongly induced by high salt. The increases in transcript levels and translation levels of
NADP-ME in leaf tissue during salt stress suggest that this gene is responsible in part for
salt tolerance in aloe [45]. Studies have shown that long-term low temperature induces
an increase in the malate content or NADP-ME activity in rye ( Secale cereale L.). When
the low-temperature stress is removed, both the malic acid content and enzyme activity
decrease. The above results indicate that rye not only regulates the malic acid content
as a good osmotic adjustment substance but also responds to the osmotic stress caused
by low temperature by regulating the NADP-ME activity. NADP-ME can not only be a
good osmotic adjustment substance by participating in some enzymatic reactions but also
balance the higher solute concentration in cells caused by low temperature [46]. ME is not
only related to low-temperature stress, but also plays an important role in high-temperature
stress. The NAD-ME activity in C3 plant rice increased with increasing temperature within
a certain temperature range. Under drought stress, a new ~122 kDa NAD-ME subtype
was formed in the mitochondria of the bundled sheath (BS) cells of the amaranth. After
watering was resumed, the isomer (~122 kDa) disappeared again. Due to the emergence
of new isomers, the activity of NAD-ME in the mitochondria of BS cells increased, which
seems to indicate that the new NAD-ME subtype is related to plant drought resistance [47].
However, its specific mechanism of action requires further research. Similarly, using quanti-
tative RT-PCR and immunochemical methods, the specific activity of NADP-ME in tobacco
Plants 2025, 14, 1603 15 of 19
leaves was determined to significantly increase under drought stress, and the de novo
synthesis of NADP-ME was enhanced. During the recovery period, the activity of the test
enzyme recovered to near its basal level [ 16]. Changes in enzyme activity and content
provide indirect evidence for the involvement of NADP-ME in the response to drought
stress. The above results were consistent with the findings of this work, in which ME genes
were expressed and played different roles to different degrees under stress treatments such
as drought, low temperature, high temperature, and salt.
4. Materials and Methods
4.1. Experimental Methods
4.1.1. Identification of ZmME Gene Family Members
For the protein sequence information of six MEs (NADP-ME and NAD-ME) reported
by the uniport database, https://www.uniprot.org/, for maize, teosinte, sorghum, rice,
barley, millet, and proso millet, we downloaded their genome and annotation files. We used
the local BLASTP v.2.6.0 (E < 1 × 10−10, identify > 50%) to perform sequence comparison
analysis, with the results being the candidate members of the ME gene family in maize.
We, reassigned the names of the members of this gene family based on their locations on
the chromosomes. We used online software ExPASy, http://web.expasy.org/protparam/
(accessed on 18 December 2024) to predict and analyze the basic physicochemical properties
of the ME proteins formally, including the molecular weight, amino acid number, and
isoelectric point.
4.1.2. Chromosomal Localization and Collinearity Analysis
Maize and sorghum genome-wide co-linearity analysis was conducted using McScan
X with a minimum module gene number of 5. ME genes from maize and sorghum were
aligned, and orthologous genes (>90% identity) were identified as originating from the same
source. A co-linearity map was generated for maize and sorghum, with red highlighting
applied to ME genes on different chromosomes that belonged to the same source.
4.1.3. Phylogenetic Analysis of Gene Families
The amino acid sequences of the identified gene family members were aligned using
Clustal W for multiple sequence alignment. Phylogenetic trees were subsequently con-
structed with MEGA11 software, employing the Neighbor-Joining method with 1000 boot-
strap replicates and default parameters. This approach refined the tree topology, allowing
clear visualization of distinct clades and their branching characteristics [48].
4.1.4. Conserved Motifs, Structural Domains and Gene Structure Analysis of Gene
Family Members
Structural information of the ZmME family genes was obtained from the genome
data of maize. The conservative base prediction of the ZmME protein sequences was
performed using the online analysis software MEME (http://meme-suite.org/tools/meme
(accessed on 18 December 2024)) with parameter settings as follows: maximum number
of motifs as 10, occurrences of a single motif, set to zero or one per sequence [ 40]. The
remaining parameters were set to default. Gene structure information was extracted from
the genome annotation files. TBtools v0.665 were utilized to integrate and visualize the
motif, conservative protein structure, and gene structural results of the ZmME family [41].
4.1.5. Gene Family Promoter Cis-Acting Element Analysis
We used seqkit to extract the upstream 2000 bp sequences of the transcription start
sites (TSSs) for the ZmME family genes. These sequences were then submitted to the Plant
CARE website http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/html/ (accessed
Plants 2025, 14, 1603 16 of 19
on 18 December 2024) for functional prediction, aiming to identify potential upstream
cis elements involved in gene regulation [42]. The prediction results were classified and
organized before being integrated into a comprehensive visualization using TBtools based
on motif conservation analysis and genomic structural data of the ZmME family genes.
4.1.6. ZmME Gene Family Expression Analysis
We selected size-equivalent B73 maize inbreeding lines as the experimental material.
The seeds were soaked in a 0.5% hypochlorite sodium solution, stirred and soaked again,
and then washed repeatedly with sterile water to ensure cleanliness. The planting was
carried out in a controlled environment with an ambient temperature of 25 ◦C and relative
humidity of 60%. After germination for seven days, the seedlings were transplanted into
plastic pots. At the stage of three leaves and one stem, different stress treatments were
applied: simulated drought stressed conditions (with air filters set at 50% relative humidity),
high-temperature stressed conditions (42 ◦C), low-temperature stressed conditions (−4 ◦C),
high NaCl stressed conditions (250 mmol/L), and PEG6000 polyethylene glycol stressed
conditions. Sampling was performed at different time points: 0 h, 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, and
24 h after the stress treatments. The samples were collected with liquid nitrogen, divided
into sealed bags with labels, and stored in a −80 ◦C freezer for future RNA extraction and
cDNA synthesis.
4.1.7. Maize ZmME Gene qRT-PCR Validation
qRT-PCR using ZmActin-1 as the reference gene was performed for the analysis of the
relative expression levels of the ZmME gene family. The reaction mixture contained 10 µL
of TB Green Premix Ex Taq II (Tli RNaseH Plus), 0.8µL each of PCR forward primer and
PCR reverse primer, 2µL DNA template, and 6.4 µL of sterile water, totaling a final volume
of 20 µL. The relative expression levels were calculated based on the experimental results
obtained using the TB Green Premix Ex Taq II (Tli RNaseH Plus) qPCR mix kit (Takara) in
the Light Cycler 96 fluorescent quantitative PCR instrument (Roche).
4.1.8. Data Processing
Data processing was performed using SPSS 20.0 software for statistical analysis and
analysis of variance (ANOVA), with the mean values and standard deviations calculated
(significant differences were defined at p < 0.05, and highly significant differences at
p < 0.01).
5. Conclusions
This study identified 13 members of the ZmME gene family in maize, and conducted a
comprehensive analysis of their physicochemical properties, evolutionary relationships,
and collinearity relationship. The ZmME gene family exhibits high stability during long-
term evolution and high conservation among crop legumes. Through the analysis of
promoter-sequential elements, it was discovered that the ZmME family contains stress-
responsive motifs and drought-induction binding sites. Under drought stress, these genes
may play a regulatory role. Notably, based on the highly induced expression of ZmME13
under various stress treatments, we conclude that ZmME13 is a promising candidate gene
with significant potential for stress resistance. Currently, ME gene families from many
other species remain understudied, and the functional roles of their members and their
involvement in stress response expression patterns are still unclear. Therefore, this study
provides a theoretical foundation for subsequent investigations into the molecular biology
functions of ZmME gene family members in maize.
