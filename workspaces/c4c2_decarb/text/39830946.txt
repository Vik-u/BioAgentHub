Dihydroporphyrin iron (DH-Fe) is a novel plant growth regulator that plays
signi ﬁcant roles in plant stress resistance. We found that Andrographis
paniculata is extremely sensitive to low temperature (LT) with a threshold of
25°C. To evaluate whether and how DH-Fe alleviates LT stress inA. paniculata,
different DH-Fe concentrations (0, 10, 20, and 40 mg·L-1) were applied to
estimate its effects on C and N metabolism and antioxidative capacity inA.
paniculata grown under 20°C. Pre-treatment of DH-Fe alleviated LT-induced
anthocyanin accumulation. Additionally, it relieved LT-induced oxidative stress
by increasing the activity of catalase (CAT). DH-Fe reduced the contents of
sucrose, soluble sugar and starch and the activities of sucrose synthase (SS) and
hexokinase (HXK), but stimulated the activities of sucrose phosphate synthase
(SPS), glucose-6-phosphate dehydro genase (G6PDH), glyceraldehyde 3-
phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC),
isocitrate dehydrogenase (ICDH), and malic enzyme (ME). Soluble protein and
proline contents were decreased by DH-Fe, while total N and free amino acids
contents were increased, accompanying by the enhancement of the activities of
glutamine synthase (GS), glutamic-o xaloacetic transaminase (GOT) and
glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GTP). Simultaneously, the content of
andrographolide, the bioactive ingredient of A. paniculata , was remarkably
declined. These results indicated that DH-Fe alleviates LT-induced oxidation by
increasing sugar catabolism and allocating C metabolicﬂow to N assimilation. A

1 Introduction
Temperature is a key environmental factor that determines plant
growth and distribution. The frequent occurrence of extreme weather
due to climate change and the introduction of plants in higher
latitude areas have resulted in short-term low temperature (LT)
stress on plants. LT stress is divided into chilling stress (< 20°C)
and freezing stress (< 0°C) according to the environmental
temperature. The underlying mechanisms by which LT constrains
plant growth and productivity are complex (Ding et al., 2019). The
most common impact of LT stress on plants is disruption of the
integrity of plant cell membranes, thereby increasing oxidative stress
and inhibiting plant growth (Manasa et al., 2022).
Since plants are sessile, the y adapt to environmental
ﬂuctuations through metabolism. There are many physiological
protective mechanisms for plants to cope with LT stress. Plants can
enhance osmotic regulation ability through accumulation of
osmotic substances such as soluble sugars and proline (Raza et al.,
2023a), and increase reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging
capacity through enzymatic and non-enzymatic pathways to
maintain cell redox homeostasis (Kocsy et al., 2001).
Carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) metabolisms are of great
importance in plant adaptation to abiotic stresses ( Cui et al.,
2019). Exposure to LT stress usually causes a decline in growth
and N assimilation, but increases carbohydrate accumulation.
Sucrose catabolism plays import ant roles in alleviating plant
stress (Zhang et al., 2024). C partitioning and the generation of
reductants (NADPH) catalyzed by dehydrogenases protect plants
from LT stress (Airaki et al., 2012; Kitashova et al., 2023). It has also
been widely reported that enhanced N metabolism increases plant
ﬁtness under the stresses such as drought (Zhong et al., 2019),
salinity (Shao et al., 2015), heavy metal (Hussain et al., 2020), and
high and low temperature (Luo et al., 2023; Soualiou et al., 2023).
Therefore, modulating carbon and nitrogen metabolism could
ameliorate plant stress tolerance.
Exogenous application of plant growth regulator plays an
important role in alleviating plant LT stress and restoring plant
productivity (Zhou et al., 2003; Ritonga and Chen, 2020). For
examples, exogenous 5-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) protects plants
against cold-triggered oxidative stress by interacting with GABA,
NO, H
2O2, and JA (Liu et al., 2018, 2019, 2020); melatonin alleviates
plants cold stress by regulating redox homeostasis (Li et al., 2018a).
Some plant hormones and analogue such as abscisic acid, salicylic
acid, and trinexapac-ethyl also act as growth regulators which can
enhance plant osmotic regulation and antioxidant capacity (Guan
et al., 2018; Raza et al., 2023b). Cao et al. (2017) reported that
exogenous glycine alleviates cold stress of rice plant by mediating N
uptake, photosynthesis, and antioxidant defense ability.
Dihydroporphyrin iron (DH-Fe) is a novel plant growth regulator
derived from silkworm excrement. Due to its characteristics of
safety and green and pollution-free, it has been extensively used in
enhancing crop stress resistance and improving the yield of cereal
and economic crops (Cao et al., 2016, 2018; Chu et al., 2023; Yang
et al., 2023). It is consistently revealed that DH-Fe ameliorates plant
photosynthesis and antioxidant capacity. However, the effects of
DH-Fe on plant LT stress resistance and the physiological
mechanism have not been well understood.
Andrographis paniculata is a medicinal plant originating from
tropical regions that could be sensitive to LT stress. It has been

introduced to and mainly cultivated in the south China since the
early 20th century. With the growing demand of pharmaceutical
industry for the herb, it has been recently introduced northward to
the area north of the Yangtze River, where the temperature could be
the key factor restricting the growth and the completion of its life
cycle. Given the excellent performance of DH-Fe in ameliorating
plant stress resistance, this st udy intended to investigate the
protective effect of DH-Fe onA. paniculata under LT stress. We
aimed to reveal the physiological mechanism by which DH-Fe
rescues A. paniculata plants from LT stress. It could provide new
ideas for relieving plant cold damage.
2 Materials and methods
2.1 Plant materials and treatments
Andrographis paniculata(Burm. f.) Ness from the Acanthaceae
was used as experimental material. The seeds were provided by the
seed bank of Guangxi Botanical Garden of Medicinal Plants.
Genetic stable and consistent lines were obtained by single plant
selection and cultivation for three generations. The seeds were sown
on seedbed ﬁlled with wet perlite-vermiculite (V: V = 4: 1) and
incubated in a growth chamber for germination. The photoperiod
was 14 h and light intensity was 100mmol·m-2·s-1 provided by LED
with a constant temperature of 28°C. Two weeks after germination,
the seedlings were transplanted to a seedling-raising plate and
continued to grow for a month in the light and temperature
conditions described above. The mixture of perlite, vermiculite
and organic fertilizer (V: V: V = 4: 1: 2) was used as growth
substratum. When the seedlings were 6-leaf age, they were
transplanted to pots and grown in the mixture of perlite,
vermiculite and organic fertilizer (V: V: V = 4: 1: 2) with the light
and temperature conditions above. The seedlings at 12-leaf age were
used for temperature treatments. The plants were put in light
incubator at constant temperature of 10°C, 15°C, 20°C, 25°C, or
30°C with a photoperiod of 14/10 h light/dark. The intensity of light
in the incubator was 100mmol·m
-2·s-1. The plants were watered
once a week with the nutrition solution as reported previously
(Huang et al., 2023), to avoid water stress.
DH-Fe was provided by Nanjing Bostec Biological Engineering
Co., Ltd. (Nanjing, China), and the content of active ingredient of
the product is 0.02%. The concentration of DH-Fe applied in this
s t u d yw a s0 ,1 0 ,2 0 ,a n d4 0mg·L-1.P l a n t sg r e wi no p t i m a l
temperature (30°C) were foliar sprayed with DH-Fe 3 days before
LT stress (20°C) treatment. Then the plants were exposed to 20°C
and grown in incubator with the light intensity of 100mmol·m-2·s-1
and the photoperiod of 14/10 h light/dark. After treatment for 7
days, the plants were sampled for evaluating the effects of DH-Fe on
plant LT stress tolerance.
2.2 Measurements of total N
Aboveground of the plants were harvested and oven-dried at
70°C to a constant weight. Then the samples wereﬁne pulverized,
and about 50 mg powder was used for total nitrogen measurement.
The samples were digested with H 2SO4-H2O2 at 260°C. The
contents of NH 4
+ and NO 3
- in the digestion solution were
measured using the indophenol blue colorimetry method at 625
nm (Novamsky et al., 1974) and ultraviolet spectrophotometry at
210 nm (Norman and Stucki, 1981) with (NH4)2SO4 and KNO3 as
standard, respectively. Total N content is the sum of NH4
+ and
NO3
- contents.
2.3 Anthocyanin measurements
Anthocyanin in fresh leaves was extracted by immersing the
samples in acid ethanol solution (0.1 mol·L-1 HCl in 95% ethanol)
and incubating at 60°C water bath for 1 h. The absorbance of the
extract was measured at 530 nm, 620 nm, and 650 nm, respectively.
Anthocyanin content based on fresh weight was calculated using the
molar extinction coefﬁcient of 4.62 × 104 mM-1·cm-1 (Sun et al., 2018).
2.4 Measurement of hydrogen peroxide
and lipid peroxidation
H2O2 was measured by colorimetry with titanium (Brennan
and Frenkel, 1977). Frozen leaf samples (0.1 g) were homogenized
with 10 mmol·L-1 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole and centrifuged at 4°C and
9400 g for 10 min. The supernatant was reacted with 0.1% titanium
sulphate in 20% H2SO4. Removing precipitant, the supernatant was
measured colorimetrically at 410 nm. H2O2 was used as standard.
Malondialdehyde (MDA) content represents lipid peroxidation.
MDA in leaf samples was prepared as soluble protein described
latter. The supernatant was reacted with 0.6% thiobarbituric acid in
5% trichloroacetic acid in boiling water bath for 15 min. After
centrifuging at 9400 g for 10 min, the supernatant was measured
spectrophotometrically at 450 nm, 532 nm, and 600 nm,
respectively. The MDA content was calculated as inKramer et al
(1991) using the coefﬁcient of 0.155 mM
-1·cm-1.
2.5 Soluble protein and antioxidant indexes
Soluble protein was extracted by 100 mmol·L -1 sodium
phosphate buffer (pH7.5) by homogenizing frozen samples in
pre-cooled mortar and pestle. The homogenates were centrifuged
at 4°C and 9400 g for 10 min, and soluble protein content in the
supernatant was measured spectrophotometrically at 562 nm using
the BCA-protein assay (Smith et al., 1985).
Catalase (CAT) activity was measured by monitoring the decline
rate of absorbance at 240 nm (A240) after adding 0.1 mL enzymes
extract in 1 mL reaction system containing 50 mmol·L-1 sodium
phosphate buffer (pH7.8) and 20 mmol·L-1 H2O2. The activity of
CAT was represented as mmol H2O2·mg-1 protein·min -1.T h e
extinction coefﬁcient of H2O2 is 36 mM-1·cm-1 (Havir and Mchale,
1987). Superoxide dismutase (SOD) activity was measured by
monitoring the inhibition of photochemical reduction of nitro-blue
tetazolium (NBT) (Jalali-e-Emam et al., 2011).

2.6 Amino acids and proline
Total free amino acids were measured by ninhydrin method
(Sun et al., 2006) with some modiﬁcations. Frozen leaf samples
(0.1 g) were homogenized with 10% acetic acid, and then
centrifuged at 4°C and 9400 g for 10 min. The supernatant was
incubated in boiling water bath for 15 min, and then reacted with
0.5% ninhydrin reagent in the mixture of N-propyl alcohol, N-
butanol, ethylene glycol, and sodium acetate buffer (pH5.4) (V: V:
V: V = 1: 2: 4: 0.6) in boiling water bath for 15 min. The absorbance
at 580 nm was detected and the content of amino acid N was
calculated with leucine as standard.
Proline in frozen leaf samples (0.1 g) was extracted with 3%
sulfosalicylic acid in boiling water bath for 10 min. After cooling, 2
mL extract was reacted with 3 mL 2.5% ninhydrin in the mixture of
acetic acid and 6 mol·L
-1 orthophosphoric acid (H3PO4) (V: V = 3:
2) in boiling water bath for 40 min. Cooling again, the proline in the
solution was extracted with 2 mL methylbenzene, and then
measured spectrophotometrically at 520 nm (Bates et al., 1973).
The proline concentration was calculated by the standard curve.
2.7 Nitrogen metabolism enzymes
Frozen leaf samples (0.1 g) were homogenized with 3 ml 50
mmol·L-1 Tris-HCl (pH8.0, containing 2 mmol·L-1 Mg2+, 2 mmol·L-1
DTT and 0.4 mol·L-1 sucrose) and centrifuged at 4°C and 9400 g for
10 min. The supernatant was used for measurement of glutamine
synthase (GS), glutamate synthase (GOGAT), glutamate
dehydrogenase (GDH), glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT),
and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase (GPT) activities as reported
previously (Zhong et al., 2017). Soluble protein in enzyme extract
was measured using the BCA-protein assay.
2.8 Sugars and starch
Sucrose and soluble sugar were extracted by deionized water at
80°C water bath for 30 min and 3 times. The extracts were collected.
Starch in the residues was extracted using perchloric acid after
starch was gelatinized at boiling water bath. Sucrose was quantiﬁed
colorimetrically at 500 nm by the dioxybenzene method (Li et al.,
2012), and soluble sugar and starch were measured using the
sulfuric acid-anthrone method (Wang et al., 2002). Sucrose and
glucose were used as standard.
2.9 Quantiﬁcation of carbohydrate
metabolic enzymes activities
Enzymes were extracted by homogenizing frozen leaf samples
(~ 0.1 g) with HEPES-KOH (pH7.5) containing 50 mmol·L -1
MgCl2, 10 mmol·L-1 b-mercaptoethanol, 2 mmol·L-1 EDTA, and
2% (W/V) PVP. The homogenates were centrifuged at 4°C and
9400 g for 10 min. The supernatant was used for enzyme activity
measurements. Sucrose synthase (SS) and sucrose phosphate
synthase (SPS) activities were assayed by the kits (Suzhou Michy
Biomedical Technology Co., Ltd).
The assay mixture of hexokinase (HXK) contained 100 mmol·L-1
Tris-HCl (pH7.5), 2 mmol·L-1 MgCl2,1 0m m o l · L-1 KCl, 1 mmol·L-1

assayed in a system containing, in a total volume of 1 mL, 100
mmol·L-1 Tris-HCl (pH8.0), 10 mmol·L -1 MgCl2, 25 mmol·L-1
NaHCO3, 1 mmol·L-1 DTT, 0.2 mmol·L-1 NADH, 24 units ofL-
malate dehydrogenase, 8 mmol·L-1 PEP, and 0.1 mL enzyme extract
(Petersen et al., 2001).
The assay mixture of malic enzyme (ME) contained 100
mmol·L -1 HEPES-KOH (pH 7.5), 5 mmol·L -1 MgSO 4,0 . 5
mmol·L-1 NADP+, 5 mmol·L-1 L(+)-malate, and 0.1 mL of enzyme

Enzyme activities were calculated by the average rate of NAD
(P)+ reduction or NAD(P)H oxidation during theﬁrst 2 min after
the start of the reaction. Soluble protein in enzyme extract was
measured using the BCA-protein assay.

2.11 Statistical analysis
All the tests were carried out in triplicate or quadruplicate, and
the results were presented as mean value ± standard deviation.
Analysis of signiﬁcant differences and correlation was performed in
SPSS Statistics 19 software (IBM Inc., Chicago, IL, USA), using the
one-way ANOVA and Duncan ’s multiple range method and
Pearson correlation coef ﬁcient method, respectively. Statistical
signiﬁcance was considered whenP < 0.05.
3 Results
3.1 Low temperature inhibitsA. paniculata
growth and promote oxidation stress
As shown inFigure 1A, A. paniculata is extremely sensitive to
low temperature (LT).A. paniculatagrown vigorously at 30°C, but
its growth was inhibited and its development was accelerated when
the temperature was 20°C and 25°C, in which conditions plants
showed earlyﬂower branch differentiation and even earlyﬂowering.
Plants cannot survive at 10°C, and the growth was arrested at 15°C.
Anthocyanin was remarkably accumulated when temperature
was lower than 25°C ( Figure 1B ), while soluble protein was
decreased gradually with the increase of temperature (Figure 1C).
Additionally, LT remarkably increased the contents of H2O2 and
MDA, as well as the activity of SOD (Figures 1D– F), while the CAT
activity was dramatically reduced when the temperature was lower
than 20°C (Figure 1G). These results suggested thatA. paniculatais
a LT-sensitive plant, which is damaged from LT lower than 25°C.
Leaf N content showed an upward tendency with the increase of
temperature, but there was no signiﬁcant difference among 20°C,
25°C, and 30°C (Figure 1H). Sucrose, soluble sugar and starch
contents were reduced with the increase of temperature, but they
were not different between 25°C and 30°C (Figures 1I– K). The
results indicated that LT suppressed C and N metabolism ofA.

LT stress.
3.2 DH-Fe pretreatment alleviated LT stress
induced oxidation stress
Plants were pretreated with different DH-Fe concentrations and
grown at 20°C. It was clear that application of DH-Fe reduced the
accumulation of anthocyanin in leaves under LT stress (Figure 2A).
The H2O2 and malondialdehyde (MDA) contents were remarkably
reduced by DH-Fe, with the lowest contents at 20mg·L-1 DH-Fe
(Figures 2B, C). The SOD activity was signiﬁcantly repressed when
the DH-Fe concentration was 40mg·L-1 (Figure 2D). In contrast, the
CAT activity was triggered by DH-Fe application, with a signiﬁcant
increase at 20 and 40mg·L-1 (Figure 2E). Apparently, DH-Fe is an
effective protectant for plants under LT stress.
3.3 DH-Fe pretreatment reduced LT stress
induced sugar accumulation
DH-Fe remarkably reduced the accumulation of sucrose, with
the lowest content at 20mg·L-1 (Figure 3A). Both total soluble sugar
and starch contents were not different from the control at 10mg·L-1
DH-Fe, but they were remarkably lower at 20 and 40mg·L-1 DH-Fe
(Figures 3B, C).
The activity of SPS was remarkably higher at 20mg·L-1 DH-Fe
than that in the control (Figure 4A). In contrast, DH-Fe treatments
signiﬁcantly suppressed SS and HXK activities (Figures 4B, C). The
GAPDH, PEPC and ICDH activities were remarkably increased by
all DH-Fe concentrations (Figures 4D, E, H), while the G6PDH and
ME activities were signi ﬁcantly higher at 20 mg·L-1 DH-Fe
(Figures 4F, G). The results revealed that DH-Fe stimulated sugar
catabolism inA. paniculata under LT stress.
3.4 DH-Fe pretreatment increased N
metabolism under LT stress
DH-Fe application raised the content of leaf total N, which was
signiﬁcantly higher at 20 and 40 mg·L-1 DH-Fe (Figure 5A ).
However, DH-Fe remarkably declined the accumulation of
soluble protein, and the lowest soluble protein content was
observed at 20 mg·L-1 DH-Fe (Figure 5B). In line with total N,
free amino acids content was markedly enhanced by DH-Fe, with
the greatest at 20mg·L-1 DH-Fe (Figure 5C). Conversely, the proline
content was descended in DH-Fe treatments (Figure 5D).
DH-Fe application considerably enhanced the GS activity
(Figure 6A), but reduced the GOGAT activity (Figure 6B). Both
GOT and GPT activities were remarkably increased at 20 and 40
mg·L-1 DH-Fe (Figures 6C, D). These results indicated that DH-Fe
promoted N uptake and assimilation in A. paniculata under
LT stress.

3.5 DH-Fe pretreatment decreased
andrographolide accumulation under
LT stress
DH-Fe pretreatment mainly affected andrographolide (AG) of
diterpene lactones in A. paniculata. With the growing DH-Fe
concentration, AG content was decreased gradually and signiﬁcantly
(Figure 7A). However, the contents of neoandrographolide (NAG)
and 14-deoxyandrographolide (DOAG) were not signiﬁcantly affected
by DH-Fe (Figures 7B, C). In contrast, 20mg·L-1 DH-Fe remarkably
increased the content of 14-deoxy-11, 12-didehydroandrographolide
(DHAG) (Figure 7D). The AG content was negatively correlated with
N content (P < 0.05) but positively correlated with sugars contents
(P > 0.05) (Table 1).

Low temperature is the main obstacle it faces during its northward
introduction. In this study, by treating with temperature gradients,
we found thatA. paniculata is very sensitive to low temperature.
Temperature at 20°C-25°C not only inhibited its growth but also
accelerated its development, and temperature lower than 15°C
retarded its growth or even lethal for the plant. Thus, 15°C and
25°C could be the temperature thresholds for the survival and
vigorous growth of this plant species, respectively. To reveal the
physiological mechanism by whichA. paniculatain response to LT
is of great signiﬁcance for enhancing its LT tolerance via application
of exogenous regulators and breeding.
LT stress dysregulates many physiological processes in plant
such as reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism, photosynthesis,
respiration, and N metabolism (Airaki et al., 2012). LT evokes the
production of ROS in plants, predisposing them to oxidative bursts
and stress within plant cells. The production and scavenging of ROS
are pivotal for plants to adapt to LT stress. LT conditions (e.g. 15°C,
20°C, and 25°C) elevated oxidative stress of plants as indicated by
increased H2O2 and MDA contents, as well as enhanced SOD
activity. Under LT conditions, limitation of CO2 ﬁxation coupled
with over-reduction of the electron transport chain is the main
cause of ROS production ( Suzuki and Mittler, 2006 ).
Dihydroporphyrin is a type of reduced porphyrin, a speci ﬁc
chlorophyll derivative; Fe is an important factor mediating
chlorophyll biosynthesis. Foliar DH-Fe application restores leaf
chlorophyll content, enhances the activities of antioxidant
enzymes, and decreases the generation rate of H2O2 (Cao et al.,
2016). Here, DH-Fe at 20 and 40mg·L-1 considerably dropped the
accumulation of H2O2 and MDA, but remarkably increased the
CAT activity under LT stress, suggesting that appropriate
concentration of DH-Fe alleviates LT-induced oxidative stress by
enhancing CAT activity inA. paniculata plants.
Sugars function as osmoprotectants, whose accumulation has
been considered to be an adaptive mechanism of plants to stresses
(Ahmad et al., 2020). However, high accumulation of sugars leads to
plant growth retardation and even is toxic to plants (Huang et al.,
FIGURE 5

Frontiers inPlant Science frontiersin.org08
2022). Excessive accumulation of sugars triggers the synthesis of
anthocyanin (Murakami et al., 2008). Here, we found that LT stress
induced a great accumulation of anthocyanin in leaves, which was
associated with the build-up of sugars. It was suggested that sugar
could inhibit plant growth via the synthesis of anthocyanin. An
extensive accumulation of anthocyanin coupled with the increases
in SOD activity and MDA content lead to plant senescence (Jakhar
and Mukherjee, 2014). The increased anthocyanin content and
oxidative stress under LT stress could contribute to LT-induced
early ﬂowering in A. paniculata. Thus, the catabolism of sugars
(carbohydrates) could be beneﬁcial for plants to acclimate LT stress.
DH-Fe alleviates plant senescence under stress condition (Chu
et al., 2023). The results in this study showed that high DH-Fe
concentration eliminated the phenotype of anthocyanin
accumulation, accompanying with reduced sugar accumulation.
Simultaneously, the SOD act ivity and MDA content were
decreased. The results indicated that DH-Fe delayed senescence
of A. paniculata plants under LT stress by accelerating
sugar catabolism.
C partitioning between biosynthetic and dissimilatory pathways
is essential in plant LT acclimation (Kitashova et al., 2023). Several
enzymes such as sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) and
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) play important roles in
mediating C metabolic ﬂow into downstream TCA cycle and N
assimilation (Champigny and Foyer, 1992; Yu et al., 2017; Li et al.,
2018b). The pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) is important to
produce precursors for nucleotide and amino acid biosynthesis, to
provide reductant for anabolism, and to defeat oxidative stress
(Stincone et al., 2014). In this study, the activities of SPS, PEPC,
G6PDH and GAPDH were elevated by pretreatment of DH-Fe
under LT stress, whereas the HXK and SS activities were
downregulated. It was implied that DH-Fe pretreatment activated
the PPP and downstream glycolysis under LT stress.
NADPH oxidase contributes to the production of ROS in LT
conditions (Suzuki and Mittler, 2006). It has been proposed that the
NADPH-generating dehydrogenases function in plant cold stress
acclimation through their effect on the redox state of plant cells
(Airaki et al., 2012 ). The PPP is a critical process producing

NADPH, which functions in maintaining redox balance under
stress situations. The key enzyme in PPP, NDAP-dependent
G6PDH, together with other NADPH-generating enzymes such
as ICDH and ME could provide NADPH for ATP synthesis (Lawlor
and Tezara, 2009), N assimilation (Thormählen et al., 2015), and
reduction of oxidized glutathione (Lascano et al., 1999). In the
current study, the activities of G6PDH, ICDH and ME were
remarkably increased by DH-Fe, implying that DH-Fe enhanced
LT stress tolerance of A. paniculata plants by promoting the
production of reductants.
Increase in sugar catabolism not only maintains cell redox
homeostasis but also provides C skeletons for N metabolism. The
increased ICDH activity could provide more C skeletons ( a-
ketoglutarate) for N assimilation. In this study, DH-Fe reversed
the inhibition of LT stress on N metabolism, which was
corroborated by the increases in the activities of GS, GOT and
GTP and the content of N. It was suggested that DH-Fe promotes N
uptake and assimilation to enhance the resistance ofA. paniculata
to LT stress. N metabolism has been demonstrated to be essential
for plantﬁtness (Wang and Lü, 2020), although it itself is one of the
main processes that are susceptible to adversities in plants. There
are several mechanisms that N metabolism involves in plant

resistance to adverse circumstances, including dissipating excessive
energy by assimilation of inorganic N (Yi et al., 2014), stabilizing
protein and maintaining photosynthesis ( Zhong et al., 2019 ),
providing osmolytes such as soluble protein, free amino acids and
proline (Ashraf and Foolad, 2007 ), and improving cell redox
homeostasis (Soualiou et al., 2023). We found that soluble protein
and proline contents were reduced by DH-Fe application under LT
stress, which was similar to the results those under optimal
temperature (30°C). Theﬁndings illustrated that the enhanced N
metabolism resulted from DH-Fe application is less likely to
alleviate the damage of LT stress toA. paniculata by enhancing
osmotic regulation. Alternatively, it could involve in dissipating
excessive energy and maintaining cell redox homeostasis.
Fundamentally, energy excess and redox imbalance are the main
issues that plants face under LT stress.
Secondary metabolites are important bioactive ingredients in
medicinal plants. They also act as defensive substances enhancing
plant stress resistance. Under well growth conditions, in which N
metabolism activity is vigorous and sugar accumulation is relatively
low, the accumulation of second ary metabolites is depressed
(Rühmann et al., 2002). It has been proposed that the synthesis of
protein and amino acids required for plant growth could attenuate
the allocation of C metabolicﬂow to the synthesis of secondary
metabolites (Larbat et al., 2016). Diterpene lactones are the major
bioactive secondary metabolites in A. paniculata .T h e i r
accumulation is induced by several adversities such as drought
(Chen et al., 2020), salt stress (Talei et al., 2015), and ultraviolet
radiation (Sun et al., 2022). Andrographolide content was decreased
with the increase of DH-Fe concentration, which was in line with
the decrease of sugar contents but opposite to the increase of N
content. The results reﬂected that DH-Fe ameliorated plant growth
under LT stress and therefore, diminished the allocation of
carbohydrates to andrographolide biosynthesis inA. paniculata.
5 Conclusion
A. paniculata is a low temperature sensitive plant with a
threshold of 25°C. Application of DH-Fe alleviated LT-induced
oxidative stress in A. paniculata plants by increasing antioxidant
capacity, with the most effective concentration at 20mg·L-1. The role
of DH-Fe in inducing osmotic regulation was excluded due to
reduced soluble protein, proli ne and sugars contents. DH-Fe
promoted sugar catabolism via the enzymes of G6PDH, GAPDH,
PEPC, ME, and ICDH, which provided reductant for redox
homeostasis and C skeletons for downstream N assimilation
(Figure 8). Thus, C and N metabolisms play the center role in
DH-Fe attenuating LT stress induced oxidative stress. The results
indicated that application of DH-Fe is an effective strategy forA.
paniculata plants overcoming LT stress. However, a long-term
experiment is needed to evaluate the effect of DH-Fe on
improving the growth ofA. paniculata under LT conditions.
FIGURE 8
Schematic diagram of the mechanism of DH-Fe enhancing the LT adaptability ofA. paniculata. The brown box represents enhanced, and green box
represents decreased by DH-Fe. The thickness of the arrows indicates the relative magnitude of metabolicﬂux. Under LT conditions, DH-Fe reduced
the accumulation of sugars and anthocyanin, but increased the catabolism of sugars. The activities of G6PDH, GAPDH, PEPC, ME, and ICDH were
enhanced by DH-Fe, resulting in increased allocation of C metabolicﬂow towards to N assimilation and amino acids synthesis. Simultaneously,
andrographolide content was decreased. G6PDH, ME, and ICDH are NADPH-generating enzymes. The increase of their activities could lead to high
production of NADPH, which can prevent excessive accumulation of H
2O2 and alleviate lipid peroxidation.
