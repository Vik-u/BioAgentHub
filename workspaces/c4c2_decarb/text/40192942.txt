1 Introduction
Cancer cells exhibit metabolic reprogramming, a cancer 
hallmark phenomenon known as the Warburg effect, char -
acterized by a preference for aerobic glycolysis over oxi -
dative phosphorylation even in the presence of oxygen [ 1]. 
This metabolic reprogramming supports rapid cell prolif -
eration and survival in the tumor microenvironment [ 2, 3]. 
Understanding the molecular mechanisms driving tumor 
metabolism changes is essential for developing effective 
therapeutic strategies against cancer [4–6].

Abstract
Purpose Post-translational modifications, such as lactylation, are emerging as critical regulators of metabolic enzymes in 
cancer progression. Mitochondrial malic enzyme 2 (ME2), a key enzyme in the TCA cycle, plays a pivotal role in maintain-
ing redox homeostasis and supporting tumor metabolism. However, the functional significance of ME2 lactylation and its 
regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. This study investigates the role of ME2 K352 lactylation in modulating enzymatic 
activity, redox balance, and tumor progression.
Methods Immunoprecipitation and western blotting were used to assess ME2 lactylation and its interaction with Sirtuin 3 
(SIRT3). Mass spectrometry identified the lactylation site on ME2. Enzymatic activity was measured using NADH produc-
tion assays. The functional effects of ME2 K352 lactylation were analyzed by measuring ROS levels, NADP⁺/NADPH 
ratios, metabolic intermediates, and mitochondrial respiration parameters. Cell proliferation was evaluated via CCK-8 and 
colony formation assays. Xenograft tumor models and Ki-67 immunohistochemical staining were used to assess tumor 
growth and proliferation in vivo.
Results Mass spectrometry identified K352 as the primary lactylation site on ME2. Sodium lactate treatment enhanced ME2 
lactylation and enzymatic activity, while SIRT3-mediated delactylation at K352 reduced ME2 activity, disrupting redox 
homeostasis. Cells expressing the K352R mutant exhibited elevated ROS levels, higher NADP⁺/NADPH ratios, and altered 
levels of metabolic intermediates, including increased malate and lactate with reduced pyruvate. Additionally, re-expression 
of ME2 K352R in HCT116 cells significantly impaired proliferation and colony formation. In vivo, xenograft models dem-
onstrated that ME2 K352R expression suppressed tumor growth, as evidenced by reduced tumor volume, weight, and Ki-67 
staining.
Conclusions This study reveals that ME2 K352 lactylation is a critical regulatory mechanism that modulates enzymatic 
activity, mitochondrial function, and tumor progression. SIRT3-mediated delactylation of ME2 K352 disrupts redox homeo-
stasis and inhibits tumor growth. These findings highlight the potential of targeting ME2 lactylation as a therapeutic strategy 
in cancer treatment.

Malic enzymes (MEs) catalyze the oxidative decarbox -
ylation of malate to pyruvate, generating either NADPH or 
NADH in the process [ 7, 8]. In mammals, three isoforms 
of MEs have been identified: ME1, a cytosolic NADP⁺-
dependent enzyme; ME2, a mitochondrial isoform capable 
of utilizing both NAD⁺ and NADP⁺; and ME3, a mitochon-
drial NADP⁺-specific enzyme. Among these, ME1 and ME2 
are the predominant forms [ 9]. ME2 plays a central role in 
regulating TCA cycle flux, aligning metabolic activity with 
cellular demands for energy, biosynthetic precursors, and 
redox balance [ 8, 10]. It is particularly important in gluta -
mine and lipid metabolism, which are critical for meeting 
the heightened metabolic needs of cancer cells [ 10]. Dys-
regulated ME2 expression has been implicated in various 
cancers, where it promotes tumor progression through mul-
tiple mechanisms. For example, 2-hydroxyglutarate (2-HG) 
produced by ME2 stabilizes mutant p53 and drives colorec-
tal cancer (CRC) growth [ 11]. In addition, a recent study 
revealed that ME2 regulates CD8 + T cell activation and 
antitumor immunity by modulating TCA cycle flux [ 12]. 
Despite its importance in cancer metabolism, the mecha -
nisms controlling ME2 activity remain poorly undefined 
[13].
Post-translational modifications (PTMs) are critical regu-
lators of protein function, influencing their activity, stabil -
ity, and subcellular localization [ 14]. Recent studies have 
demonstrated that ME2 activity is intricately regulated by 
various PTMs. For example, we previously showed that 
succinylation can inhibit ME2 activity, subsequently sup -
pressing mitochondrial respiration and cell proliferation in 
CRC [13]. In addition, PRMT1-mediated methylation at the 
R67 site activates ME2, enhancing redox homeostasis and 
driving the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
[15]. However, the full spectrum of regulatory mechanisms 
controlling ME2 activity remains to be fully elucidated.
In this study, we uncover lactylation as a novel PTM of 
ME2, specifically at the K352 residue. This modification 
markedly enhances ME2 enzymatic activity, linking it to 
increased NADPH production and mitochondrial respira -
tion. We also identify Sirtuin 3 (SIRT3), a mitochondrial 
deacetylase, as a delactylase for ME2. By removing lacty -
lation, SIRT3 inhibits ME2 activity, disrupting redox bal -
ance and suppressing CRC cell growth. Our findings reveal 
a previously uncharacterized mechanism regulating ME2 
activity, highlighting the dynamic interplay between lacty -
lation and SIRT3-mediated delactylation. These insights not 
only enhance our understanding of tumor metabolism but 
also suggest that targeting ME2 lactylation could represent 
a promising therapeutic strategy for cancer.
2 Materials and methods
2.1 Cell lines and culture conditions
Human embryonic kidney 293T (HEK293T) and HCT116 
cells were obtained from the American Type Culture Col -
lection (ATCC) and maintained in Dulbecco’s Modified 
Eagle Medium (DMEM) (Eallbio), supplemented with 10% 
fetal bovine serum (VivaCell) and penicillin/streptomycin 
(Beyotime). Cells were cultured in a humidified incubator at 
37 °C with 5% CO 2. Cell line authenticity was verified via 
short tandem repeat (STR) profiling, and all cultures were 
confirmed to be free of mycoplasma contamination.
2.2 Reagents and antibodies
Anti-Flag M2 magnetic beads (A2220, Sigma), nicotin -
amide (NAM, 72345, Sigma), and 3×Flag peptide (Beyo -
time). Antibodies used included β-actin (81115-1-RR, 
Proteintech), HA (51064-2-AP, Proteintech), ME2 (24944-
1-AP, Proteintech), SIRT3 (15122-1-AP, Proteintech), Flag 
(M185-3, MBL), Pan-lactylation (PTM-1401, PTM), and 
Tom20 (sc-17764, Santa Cruz).
2.3 Plasmid construction
The cDNA encoding full-length human ME2 was cloned 
into Flag-tagged vectors (pRK7-Flag). Site-directed muta -
genesis to generate point mutations in the ME2 constructs 
was performed using the Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit 
(C215-01, Vazyme).
2.4 Co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) and Western 
blotting
Cells were lysed in NP40 lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 
pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1-0.5% NP40, 1 mM PMSF, and 
protease inhibitors). For Co-IP, cell lysates were incubated 
with anti-Flag M2 magnetic beads at 4 °C for 4 h. The beads 
were washed three times with ice-cold NP40 buffer, and 
bound proteins were eluted by heating in 1× loading buffer 
at 100 °C for 10 min. The protein samples were resolved by 
SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and blocked 
with 5% skim milk. Membranes were incubated with pri -
mary antibodies at 4 °C overnight. Protein bands were visu-
alized using an ECL Kit (E412-02, Vazyme).
2.5 Immunofluorescence (IF) analysis
Cells were fixed, permeabilized, and incubated with pri -
mary antibodies (1:100 dilution) at 4 °C overnight, fol -
lowed by fluorescence-conjugated secondary antibodies and

counterstained with DAPI to visualize nuclei. Images were 
captured using a confocal microscope.
2.6 Measurement of intracellular NADP+/NADPH 
ratios
To evaluate intracellular NADP+/NADPH ratios, cells were 
seeded into 6-well plates and incubated for 24 h prior to 
harvesting. The NADP +/NADPH ratios were determined 
spectrophotometrically using the NADP +/NADPH Assay 
Kit (S0179, Beyotime) following the protocols provided by 
the manufacturer.
2.7 Measurement of intracellular metabolite and 
ATP levels
Intracellular levels of pyruvate, malate, lactate and ATP 
were measured spectrophotometrically as we previously 
described [13]. Briefly, cells were plated in 96-well plates 
and incubated for 24 h before analysis. Specific assay kits 
were used for each metabolite: Pyruvate Content Assay 
Kit (BC2205, Solarbio), Malic Acid Content Assay Kit 
(BC5495, Solarbio), L-Lactic Acid Colorimetric Assay 
Kit (E-BC-K044-M, Eton), and ATP Content Assay Kit 
(BC0305, Solarbio). All measurements were conducted 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
2.8 Cell proliferation
Cell proliferation assay was performed as we previously 
described [13].
2.9 Generation of ME2 reconstituted cell lines
To generate stable ME2 mutant cell lines, endogenous ME2 
was depleted using a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) targeting 
sequence inserted into the lentiviral vector. For reconstitu -
tion, shRNA-resistant Flag-tagged wild-type (WT) ME2 
and its K352R mutants were cloned into another lentiviral 
vector. Recombinant lentiviruses were packaged by Shang-
hai GenePharma Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China) and used to 
infect HCT116 cells in the presence of 10 µg/mL poly -
brene to enhance viral transduction efficiency. Cells stably 
expressing shME2 were selected with 250 µg/mL hygro-
mycin for 2 weeks. To establish reconstituted cell lines, 
shRNA-resistant Flag-tagged WT ME2 or K352R mutants 
were introduced into shME2-expressing cells, followed by 
2 µg/mL puromycin selection for another 2 weeks. The effi-
ciency of ME2 knockdown and re-expression was validated 
by western blot.
2.10 Tumor formation assays in nude mice
HCT116 cells stably expressing ME2 (WT and K352R) 
were subcutaneously injected into the same flank of athy -
mic male BALB/c nude mice obtained from CavensBiogle 
(Changzhou, China) at 5 weeks of age (n = 5 for each group). 
The mice were sacrificed 3 weeks after injection, and tumor 
growth was measured.
2.11 Measurement of ME2 enzyme activity
Purified ME2 or mutant protein samples were added to 
reaction mixtures containing 50 mM MES (pH 6.5), 10 mM 
MgCl2, 24 mM L-malate, and 1 mM NAD +. ME2 activity 
was measured by monitoring the increase in absorbance at 
340 nm, indicative of NADH production. Absorbance was 
measured using an EPOCH2 microplate reader (BioTek).
2.12 Statistical analyses
Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation (SD). Sta -
tistical comparisons were performed using a two-tailed 
Student’s t-test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOV A) 
using GraphPad Prism 8.
3 Results
3.1 ME2 can be lactylated
Lactate is a critical substrate for lactylation and plays a 
pivotal role in promoting this PTM. To investigate whether 
ME2 can be lactylated, we first evaluated the effect of lactate 
on the ME2 lactylation. Using HEK293T cells expressing 
Flag-tagged ME2, we observed a significant increase in lac-
tylation levels following treatment with sodium lactate, as 
confirmed by IP and immunoblotting assays (Fig. 1A). Also, 
endogenous IP results confirmed the presence of ME2 lac -
tylation under physiological conditions (Fig. 1B). Further-
more, the lactylation of ME2 exhibited a dose-dependent 
response, with increasing sodium lactate concentrations 
correlating with higher lactylation levels (Fig. 1C). To 
investigate how lactate levels regulate ME2 lactylation, we 
employed pharmacological agents to modulate lactate pro -
duction. Rotenone, an inhibitor of mitochondrial oxidative 
phosphorylation, was used to increase lactate production, 
while oxamate (OXA), an inhibitor of lactate dehydroge -
nase (LDH), was utilized to reduce lactate levels [16]. These 
agents were applied to enhance and suppress protein lacty -
lation, respectively. Consistent with our hypothesis, treat -
ment with oxamate significantly decreased ME2 lactylation, 
whereas rotenone enhanced lactylation levels of ME2

results showed that the lactylation levels of both K352R 
and K352Q mutants were significantly reduced compared 
to WT ME2, indicating that K352 is a critical lactylation 
site on ME2 (Fig. 2B). Furthermore, sequence alignment 
analyses revealed that K352 is a highly conserved residue 
across various species, underscoring its potential functional 
importance (Fig. 2C). To further confirm K352 as the main 
lactylated site of ME2, we transfected HEK293T cells with 
Flag-tagged WT ME2 or K352R mutant, followed by treat-
ment with sodium lactate. The results demonstrated that 
sodium lactate treatment significantly enhanced the lac -
tylation level of WT ME2, whereas no obvious changes 
were observed in the lactylation levels of K352R mutants 
(Fig. 2D). These findings confirm that K352 is the primary 
lactylation site on ME2.
(Fig. 1D-E). In addition, IF analysis further confirmed the 
colocalization of lactylation and ME2 in CRC cells, further 
supporting the existence of lactylated ME2 in cancer cells 
(Fig. 1F). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that ME2 
can be lactylated.
3.2 ME2 is lactylated at K352
To identify potential lactylation sites on ME2, we purified 
lactylated ME2 protein from HEK293T cells and performed 
mass spectrometry analyses. The results revealed a poten -
tial lactylation site at lysine 352 (K352) on ME2 (Fig. 2A). 
To further confirm the specificity of lactylation at K352, 
we generated site-directed mutants by substituting lysine 
with either arginine (K352R, mimicking the delactylated 
state) or glutamine (K352Q, mimicking negatively charged 
lactylated lysine). Flag-tagged wild-type (WT) ME2 and 
mutant constructs were expressed in HEK293T cells. The

delactylation, we co-transfected HA-tagged SIRT3 with 
either WT ME2-Flag or its K352R mutant into HEK293T 
cells. The results showed that SIRT3 overexpression signifi-
cantly reduced the lactylation level of WT ME2, but had no 
significant effect on the K352R mutant (Fig. 3F). Similarly, 
knockdown of SIRT3 using small interfering RNA (siRNA) 
increased the lactylation level of WT ME2, whereas no sig-
nificant change was observed in the lactylation level of the 
K352R mutant, underscoring the importance of K352 in 
SIRT3-regulated delactylation of ME2 (Fig. 3G-H). These 
results demonstrate that SIRT3 interacts with ME2 and cata-
lyzes its delactylation at K352.
3.4 Delactylation at K352 by SIRT3 inhibits ME2 
activity
Given that ME2 is a metabolic enzyme with catalytic activ-
ity, we investigated whether ME2 lactylation regulates 
its enzymatic activity. Sodium lactate treatment signifi -
cantly increased ME2 activity in a dose-dependent manner 
(Fig. 4A). However, the K352R mutant exhibited markedly 
reduced enzymatic activity compared to WT ME2, while the 
K352Q mutant showed no significant difference (Fig. 4B). 
SIRT3 knockdown enhanced the enzymatic activity of WT 
ME2 but had no effect on the K352R mutant (Fig. 4C-D). 
Conversely, overexpression of SIRT3 reduced ME2 activity, 
3.3 SIRT3 interacts with and delactylates ME2
The currently identified delactylation enzymes mainly 
include Class I histone deacetylases 1–3 (HDAC1–3) in the 
nucleus and Sirtuin 1–3 (SIRT1–3) in the cytoplasm [ 17]. 
Considering that ME2 is predominantly localized in the mito-
chondria, we first examined whether NAM (nicotinamide), 
a pan-inhibitor of Sirtuin family proteins, affects the lacty -
lation of ME2. The results showed that NAM treatment sig-
nificantly increased ME2 lactylation, suggesting that ME2 
lactylation is regulated by members of the Sirtuin family 
(Fig. 3A). To identify the specific Sirtuin responsible for this 
regulation, we transfected HEK293T cells with expression 
plasmids of SIRT1–7 and investigated their effects on ME2 
lactylation. Among them, only SIRT3 significantly reduced 
the lactylation level of ME2 (Fig. 3B). Using endogenous 
co-IP, we further confirmed a direct interaction between 
ME2 and SIRT3 in HCT116 cells (Fig. 3C). IF analysis also 
demonstrated clear colocalization of ME2 and SIRT3 in the 
mitochondria (Fig. 3D). In addition, SIRT3 overexpression 
significantly decreased ME2 lactylation, whereas its enzy -
matically inactive mutant (H248Y) had no effect (Fig. 3E). 
SIRT3-mediated delactylation was observed in WT ME2 
but not in the K352R mutant, underscoring the importance 
of K352 in this regulation process (Fig. 3F–H). To further 
validate the critical role of the K352 site in SIRT3-mediated

3.5 ME2 K352 lactylation modulates mitochondrial 
respiration and redox homeostasis
To investigate the metabolic impact of ME2 K352 lacty -
lation, we depleted endogenous ME2 in HCT116 cells and 
reconstituted them with shRNA-resistant Flag-tagged WT 
ME2 or ME2 K352R (Fig. 5A). Cells expressing the K352R 
mutant exhibited significantly elevated reactive oxygen spe-
cies (ROS) levels compared to those expressing WT ME2 
(Fig. 5B). The K352R mutant also showed an increased 
NADP⁺/NADPH ratio, indicating disrupted redox balance 
(Fig. 5C). Furthermore, due to the reduced catalytic activity 
while SIRT3 H248Y mutant had no such effect (Fig. 4E). 
Importantly, SIRT3 did not alter the activity of the K352R 
mutant, further confirming the critical role of K352 in 
regulating ME2 activity through delactylation (Fig. 4F). 
These findings highlight that SIRT3-mediated delactylation 
at K352 plays a key role in modulating ME2 enzymatic 
activity.

levels significantly increase upon treatment with nicotinamide (NAM),

3.6 ME2 K352 delactylation suppresses tomor 
growth
We next evaluated the role of ME2 K352 lactylation in 
tumor progression. In vitro, HCT116 cells expressing the 
K352R mutant exhibited significantly reduced prolifera -
tion and colony formation activities compared to WT ME2 
(Fig. 5A-B). In vivo, xenograft tumor models showed that 
re-expression of ME2 K352R significantly suppressed 
of the K352R mutant, cells reconstituted with this mutant 
displayed higher malate levels and correspondingly lower 
pyruvate levels (Fig. 5D-E). Given the central role of ME2 
in mitochondrial metabolism, we further investigated the 
impact of ME2 K352 delactylation on the balance between 
glycolysis and mitochondrial respiration by measuring lac -
tate production, oxygen consumption rate (OCR), and ATP 
levels. Compared to WT ME2, re-expression of the K352R 
mutant resulted in increased lactate levels, alongside signifi-
cantly reduced OCR and ATP production (Fig. 5F–H). Col-
lectively, these findings highlight the critical role of ME2

Sirtuin 3-mediated delactylation of malic enzyme 2 disrupts redox balance and inhibits colorectal cancer…
characterized by increased lactate production in cancer 
cells, provides the substrate for lactylation, establishing a 
direct link between metabolism and epigenetic regulation. 
In this study, we revealed for the first time ME2 is lactylated 
at K352, which enhances ME2 enzymatic activity, leading 
to increased NADPH production and mitochondrial respira-
tion in CRC cells. Furthermore, we identified that SIRT3 
interacts with and delactylates ME2 at K352, thereby inhib-
iting ME2 activity, disrupting redox balance and suppress -
ing CRC growth.
Previous studies on lactylation have predominantly 
focused on histone lactylation and its impact on gene 
expression. For instance, Yu et al. uncovered a novel 
mechanism in ocular melanoma, demonstrating that his -
tone lactylation upregulates YTHDF2 expression, which 
promotes m6A-mediated degradation of tumor suppressor 
genes PER1 and TP53, thereby driving tumor progression 
[23]. In addition, H3K18 lactylation (H3K18la) and H3K9 
lactylation (H3K9la) have been shown to affect the effector 
functions of CD8 + T cells through metabolic and epigen -
etic pathways [ 24]. In 2023, proteomic analyses of HCC 
revealed that lactylation also occurs extensively on non-
histone proteins [ 25]. However, research investigating the 
lactylation of non-histone proteins, particularly metabolic 
enzymes, remains limited [ 26]. Our study builds upon this 
foundation by demonstrating that lactylation also regulates 
mitochondrial proteins, specifically ME2. The lactylation of 
ME2 at K352 enhances its enzymatic function, linking this 
PTM to increased NADPH production and redox balance—
processes critical for sustaining cancer cell proliferation 
and survival. These findings provide a novel perspective on 
how lactylation influences cellular metabolism and tumor 
progression. In addition, we previously reported that ME2 
activity is increased in CRC cells, and succinylation could 
regulate ME2 activity and inhibit its activity, thereby sup -
pressing cancer cell survival and proliferation [ 13]. These 
data highlight the pivotal regulatory role of PTMs on the 
activity of metabolic enzymes such as ME2.
Studies on non-histone protein lactylation have dem -
onstrated that this modification can either enhance or 
inhibit the functions of these proteins. For example, Ju et 
al. showed that AARS1 detects lactate and lactylates YAP, 
thereby maintaining its nuclear localization and promoting 
YAP activation [27]. In contrast, Yang et al. found that lac-
tylation at K28 of adenylate kinase 2 suppresses its activ -
ity, thereby promoting the proliferation and metastasis of 
HCC cells [ 28]. These findings highlight the diverse roles 
of lactylation in regulating protein functions and underscore 
the complexity of its impact on cellular processes. In our 
study, the enhancement of ME2 activity by lactylation sug-
gests that this modification plays a critical role in metabolic 
adaptation in tumor cells. Increased NADPH production 
tumor growth, as evidenced by reduced tumor volume and 
weight compared to WT ME2 (Fig. 5C–E). IHC staining 
for Ki-67, a marker of cell proliferation, further confirmed 
decreased proliferative activity in tumors expressing the 
K352R mutant compared to the WT ME2 group (Fig. 5F). 
Collectively, these findings underscore the tumor-suppres -
sive role of ME2 K352 delactylation and highlight its criti -
cal function in regulating tumor metabolism.
4 Discussion
ME2 is a key regulator of cellular metabolism, catalyz -
ing the conversion of malate to pyruvate while contribut -
ing to NADPH production and redox homeostasis. Its role 
in linking the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle to metabolic 
processes such as glutamine metabolism and lipid syn -
thesis underscores its importance in maintaining cellular 
metabolic flexibility, particularly under stress conditions [8, 
10]. Beyond its functions in cancer cells, ME2 also plays 
a crucial role in immune regulation, particularly in CD8 + 
T cell activation and anti-tumor immune defense. Loss of 
ME2 impairs CD8+ T cell activation and weakens the anti-
tumor immune response, highlighting its importance in 
immune metabolism [ 12]. We and others have highlighted 
the involvement of ME2 in tumorigenesis, where its dys -
regulation contributes to enhanced cancer cell survival and 
proliferation [11–13, 15, 18, 19]. However, the regulatory 
mechanisms governing ME2 activity remain incompletely 
understood.
The identification of lactylation as a PTM has expanded 
our understanding of protein regulation in various physi -
ological and pathological contexts, including cancer 
metabolism [20]. Initially discovered using peptide immu -
noprecipitation combined with high-sensitivity HPLC-MS/
MS, lactylation has been linked to epigenetic modulation 
and gene transcription regulation, particularly in can -
cer cells and macrophages [ 21, 22]. The Warburg effect,

deacetylase and metabolic regulator. By removing lacty -
lation from ME2, SIRT3 suppresses its enzymatic activity, 
disrupting NADPH production and redox homeostasis. This 
mechanism positions SIRT3 as a potential tumor suppres -
sor in CRC. Previous studies have highlighted the tumor-
suppressive functions of SIRT3 through its regulation of 
mitochondrial metabolism and oxidative stress [ 31–34]. 
Our findings further corroborate its critical role in counter -
acting oncogenic metabolic reprogramming. Interestingly, 
our previous study revealed that SIRT5 interacts with and 
desuccinylates ME2 at K346, increasing ME2 activity in 
CRC cells and promoting tumor growth [13]. These findings 
and mitochondrial respiration, mediated by lactylated ME2, 
likely support cancer cell proliferation by maintaining redox 
balance and fueling biosynthetic pathways. This aligns with 
previous studies implicating ME2 in tumorigenesis, where 
its upregulation promotes metabolic flexibility and sur -
vival in the tumor microenvironment [ 11, 12, 18, 19, 29, 
30]. However, the identification of lactylation as a regula -
tory mechanism expands the scope of ME2’s functional 
modulation and offers novel insights into its role in cancer 
progression.
SIRT3’s role as a delactylase of ME2 adds another 
dimension to its established function as a mitochondrial

demonstrated complex regulation between SIRTs and meta-
bolic enzymes like ME2.
In conclusion, our study highlights lactylation as a critical 
PTM regulating ME2 activity and establishes its interplay 
with SIRT3-mediated delactylation as a key mechanism in 
CRC metabolism. These findings provide new insights into 
the regulatory networks of tumor metabolism and suggest 
potential therapeutic avenues targeting ME2 lactylation.
