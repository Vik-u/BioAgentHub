Abstract: Metronidazole is the preferred drug for treating amoebiasis caused by Entamoeba
histolytica. Its antiamoebic activity is primarily attributed to activation by various reductases.
This study reports an alternative activation pathway in E. histolytica mediated by the
decarboxylating malic enzyme. Functional characterization of this NADPH-dependent
enzyme reveals that it is secreted into the extracellular milieu and may play a role in
E. histolytica adhesion to human enteric cells. Structural analysis of the E. histolytica malic
enzyme (EhME) demonstrates that the protein forms a strict dimer, with the protomers
interlocked by a unique knot structure formed by two polypeptide chains. This distinctive
structural feature closely aligns EhME with its prokaryotic counterparts. In conclusion, our
findings reveal that E. histolytica harbors a deeply entangled dimeric malic enzyme that
contributes to metronidazole susceptibility, sharing structural similarities with bacterial
malic enzymes.

1. Introduction
Entamoeba histolytica (Eh), the causative agent of amoebiasis, is a leading protozoan
parasite responsible for significant mortality in developing countries [1]. Metronidazole
(Mtz) remains the most widely used therapeutic agent against amoebiasis. As a pro-
drug, Mtz is reported to be activated in Entamoeba by pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase
(PFOR), ferredoxin, thioredoxin reductase, and nitroreductases [ 2,3]. Interestingly, in
Trichomonas vaginalis (Tv), a closely related protozoan, studies have shown that even after
complete loss of PFOR, cells remain susceptible to higher concentrations of Mtz [4]. How-
ever, the development of Mtz-resistant Tv strains was observed after the complete loss of
malic enzyme (ME) expression [5]. This finding led to the proposal of an alternative path-
way, where a malic enzyme (ME) was proposed to provide electrons for Mtz activation in
the absence of PFOR. In this alternative pathway, the oxidative decarboxylation of malate to

pyruvate via the hydrogenosomal malic enzyme, coupled with NADH-ferredoxin oxidore-
ductase (which reoxidizes NADH to NAD+), transfers reducing equivalents to ferredoxin.
Ferredoxin, in turn, reduces the nitro group of Mtz, producing Mtz radicals [ 4]. These
cytotoxic radicals bind to DNA [6] and protozoan proteins [2], causing DNA breakage and
protein adducts that ultimately lead to cell death [7].
Malic enzyme (ME) catalyzes the conversion of malate to pyruvate through a two-step
reaction. In the first step, malate is oxidized to oxaloacetate, which is subsequently decar-
boxylated to pyruvate and CO2 [8]. The sequence, structure, and oligomerization of malic
enzyme (ME) exhibit significant variability across living systems [9,10]. Three isoforms of
ME are commonly found. The NADP+-dependent malic enzyme (NADP-ME; EC 1.1.1.40)
exhibits a preference for NADP+ over NAD+ and has the unique ability to decarboxylate
oxaloacetate to pyruvate directly [11,12]. The NAD+-dependent malic enzyme (NAD-ME;
EC 1.1.1.39) is specialized for decarboxylating malate to pyruvate [ 13]. A third isoform,
another NAD+-dependent enzyme (EC 1.1.1.38), can decarboxylate oxaloacetate and uti-
lize both NADP+ and NAD+, though it preferentially uses NAD + [14]. ME can also be
categorized based on subcellular localization or oligomerization. For instance, plant NAD+-
dependent mitochondrial ME is phylogenetically distinct from the NADP +-dependent
cytosolic and plastidial forms found in plants [10]. The functional roles of ME vary widely
across organisms. In humans, ME plays a critical role in providing energy to neurons
and supporting proliferating cells [15,16]. In E. histolytica (Eh), this pathway plays a role
in fermentation, contributing to energy generation [17], as in many other eukaryotes. A
close homolog of E. histolytica malic enzyme (EhME) is AP65 (TvAP65), a hydrogenosomal
NADP+-dependent ME found in T. vaginalis (Tv). Beyond its housekeeping role in pyruvate
metabolism, TvAP65 has developed an additional function as an adhesive protein. It is
secreted into the extracellular environment, where it facilitates T. vaginalis adhesion to host
cells [18,19]. Whether EhME performs a similar function remains an open question. In
this study, we have biochemically and structurally characterized the NADP+-dependent
EhME, identifying its role in metronidazole (Mtz) activation. Furthermore, we have un-
covered evidence suggesting that EhME may play a potential role in host–cell interactions.
A structural analysis of EhME reveals a unique physical knot distinct among eukaryotic
MEs. The evolution of this structural feature may support its involvement in cell adhesion,
potentially contributing to the initiation of E. histolytica pathogenesis.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Cloning, Over-Expression, and Purification
The E. histolytica malic enzyme gene (GenBank accession no. AF234166) was PCR-
amplified from genomic DNA using gene-specific primers: forward primer 5′-GGA TCC
ATG GCA CAA TTA AAA GCA GAT CT-3′ and reverse primer 5′-CTC GAG TCA TTT
TCC AGT GAC TTT GTT AAT AG-3 ′. The resulting amplicon was initially cloned into
the pTZ57R/T vector (Fermentas, Waltham, MA, USA) and subsequently recloned into
the pQE30 expression vector (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), which contained an N-terminal
hexahistidine tag. This recloning process utilized BamHI and SalI restriction sites incorpo-
rated into the forward and reverse primers, respectively. The recombinant plasmid was
expressed in E. coli strain M15. For protein purification, the cells were resuspended in a
lysis buffer (RB) containing 20 mM of Tris-Cl, 300 mM of NaCl, and 20 mM of imidazole at a
pH of 8.0. The cells were lysed by sonication, and the lysate was centrifuged at 14,000 rpm
for 30 min. The resulting supernatant was loaded onto a pre-packed Ni-NTA column
prewashed with the same RB. The column was then washed with five column volumes of
RB supplemented with 50 mM of imidazole, and the bound protein was eluted using RB
containing 150 mM of imidazole. The eluted protein was further purified by Superdex 200 gel
Pathogens 2025, 14, 277 3 of 20
exclusion chromatography , which had been pre-equilibrated with a buffer containing 10 mM
of Tris, 150 mM of NaCl, and 10 mM of dithiothreitol (DTT) at a pH of 8.0. The purity of the
protein was assessed using SDS–PAGE, and the final purified protein was concentrated to
50 mg/mL using an Amicon concentrator (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA).The concen-
tration was estimated using the Bradford method, and absorbance was measured at
280 nm (A280).
2.2. Biochemical Characterization
The ME activity was performed using recombinant EhME involving the NADP+
dependent oxidation of L-malate. The assay was performed in a Varian Cary50 UV/Vis
spectrophotometer using a quartz cuvette with a 1 cm path length (Varian Medical Systems,
Palo Alto, CA, USA). The standard reaction mixture consisted of 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.4),
5 mM MnCl2, 10 mM L-malate, 0.3 mM NADP+, and 1 µg of protein in a final volume of
750 µL. After the enzyme was added to the reaction mixture at 30 ◦C, the increase in
absorbance was continuously monitored at a wavelength of 340 nm. A molar extinction
coefficient of 6.22 mM−1 cm−1 for NADPH was used to calculate enzyme activity. One
unit of enzyme activity was defined as the amount of enzyme required to catalyze the
production of 1 µmol of NADPH per minute. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constants
(Km) for the substrates L-malate and NADP+ were determined by varying the concentration
of either L-malate (5–15 mM) or NADP+ (0.1–0.5 mM) while keeping other components
at their saturation levels. To determine the binding mechanism of NADP+ and L-malate,
Lineweaver-Burk (LB) plots were generated at different concentrations of NADP+ (0.2, 0.5,
and 0.8 mM) with variable concentrations of L-malate (5–15 mM). The ATP inhibition of
the malic enzyme was also evaluated using varying concentrations of ATP (0.1–1.0 mM) in
the presence of different concentrations of L-malate (5–20 mM) and NADP+ (0.1–1.0 mM).
All kinetic assays were performed at least three times and in triplicate, and the reported
values represent the averages of these replicates. Finally, the inhibition constants (Ki) were
determined. All results were analyzed using OriginLab software, (Origin 8.5).
2.3. Metronidazole Susceptibility Assay
The involvement of EhME in metronidazole activation was assessed using two differ-
ent methods: broth dilution assay and E-test.
2.4. A. Broth Dilution
Overnight cultures of metronidazole-sensitive E. coli strain JM109 containing the
plasmid pQE30, with and without EhME inserts, were inoculated and subsequently induced
with 0.5 mM IPTG for 5 h. Approximately 50 µL of the induced cultures were transferred
into prewarmed 3 mL LB media supplemented with 100 µg mL−1 ampicillin and grown at
37 ◦C for 1 h. The cultures were then exposed to varying concentrations of metronidazole,
ranging from 0 to 320 µg mL−1, and incubated for an additional 12 h. The optical density
(OD) for bacterial growth in the overnight-grown culture was measured using a UV-visible
spectrophotometer (DU 500, Beckman, Brea, CA, USA) at 600 nm. E. coli without any EhME
expression was used as a control. At least three independent experiments were performed
in triplicate. A graph was plotted, and the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was
calculated using GraphPad Prism software (Version 5.0).
2.5. B. E-Test Assay
The EhME-induced bacterial inoculum was prepared in the same manner as the broth
dilution assay. Six milliliters of sterilized top agar at 42◦C, supplemented with 100µg mL−1
ampicillin, was mixed with 200µL of log-phase grown EhME-induced bacteria and overlaid
on LB agar plates. E. coli without any EhME expression was used as a control. After the
Pathogens 2025, 14, 277 4 of 20
plates had dried, Mtz E-strips were aseptically placed at the center of the plates. The plates
were incubated at 37 ◦C for 12 to 16 h in an upright position. The minimum inhibitory
concentration (MIC) was determined from the intersection point of the inhibitory zone and
the E-strip. Each set of experiments was conducted for three independent experiments and
in at least triplicate.
2.6. Cell Culture and Drug Treatment
The human colon cancer cell lines [Caco-2] obtained from ATCC (ATCC HTB-37) and
HT29 (ATCC HTB-38) were cultured in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (HiMedia,
India) and RPMI (HiMedia, Mumbai, India), respectively, supplemented with 10% FBS
(HyClone, Logan, UT, USA) and 1% antibiotics (Ampicillin and Streptomycin, HiMedia,
Mumbai, India) at 37 ◦C in a 5% CO2 incubator. E. histolytica trophozoites (HM1:IMSS iso-
late) were cultured axenically in TYI-S-33 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated
bovine serum. Metronidazole was added to a final concentration of 5 µM and 12 µM to
mid-logarithmic phase trophozoites, and trophozoites without drug treatment were used
as controls.
2.7. Semi-Quantitative RT-PCR
For transcriptional analysis, E. histolytica cells (146 strain) were treated with 5 and
12 µM metronidazole for 6 h, and untreated cells were used as controls. Total RNA was
isolated from metronidazole-treated and untreated cells using TRI reagent (Ambion, Austin,
TX, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. First-strand cDNA was synthesized
from isolated RNA using the RETROscript kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA), following the
manufacturer’s instructions. The synthesized cDNAs were amplified by PCR using Taq
polymerase (NEB, Ipswich, MA, USA), with the PCR conditions and primers the same as
those used for EhME amplification from genomic DNA. The PCR amplification was verified
by quantifying the cDNA-PCR products obtained after 25 cycles, ensuring amplification was
within the linear range of the corresponding mRNA species. The products were analyzed
using agarose gel electrophoresis, and densitometric quantification was performed using
UVP Launch Doc ITLS software (UVP , Jena, Germany). All amplified RT-PCR products
were normalized with respect to actin RT-PCR products.
2.8. Western Blot Assay
Proteins were separated on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel, which was then transferred to
a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with an anti-His monoclonal
antibody (1:2000; Sigma, Cream Ridge, MA, USA) and an in-house generated antibody
against EhME (1:100), followed by HRP-conjugated anti-mouse (1:5000) and anti-rabbit
secondary antibodies (1:5000; Sigma, Cream Ridge, MA, USA). Detection was carried out
using ECL (Millipore, Burlington, MA, USA). Actin was used as a loading control.
2.9. Labeling of Recombinant Malic Enzyme
Purified EhME (2 mg mL−1) was incubated with 1 mg mL−1 FITC in 0.5 M carbonate
buffer (pH 9.5) at room temperature for 1 h with gentle mixing. The mixture was dialyzed
overnight against 1X PBS at 4 ◦C, with three buffer changes. The labeled protein was then
stored at −20 ◦C for future use.
2.10. Preparation of Cell-Free Filtrate
Exponentially growing Eh cells were harvested and resuspended to a density of
5 × 106 cells mL−1 in PBS + 10 mM glucose (PBS-M) at pH 5.5, 6.0, and 6.8 and incu-
bated at 37 ◦C for 2 h to allow secretion. Trypan blue exclusion assays were performed
at the end of incubation to check cell viability, and batches with >99% viability were
Pathogens 2025, 14, 277 5 of 20
selected for further study. Supernatants from these batches were collected and filtered
through a 0.45 µm syringe filter. The cell-free supernatant was concentrated using a
10 kDa cut-off Centricon unit (Millipore, USA), and the concentrated protein was analyzed
by Western blotting.
2.11. Detection of Extracellular Released EhME Protein
Trophozoites (107 cells mL−1) at the mid-log phase of growth were washed in TYI-S-33
medium, resuspended in the same medium, and incubated for an additional 12 or 18 h at
37 ◦C. Parasite viability was monitored using a trypan blue exclusion assay, and cell lysis
was confirmed by microscopic observation. Supernatants were collected by centrifugation
at 1400 rpm at 4 ◦C. The resulting supernatant was filtered through a 0.22 µm filter to
remove insoluble debris, then precipitated with 10% TCA (w/v) and incubated overnight
at 4 ◦C. The precipitate was centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 rpm, washed twice with 4 mL
acetone, and dried in air. The dried proteins were resuspended in 1X PBS and analyzed by
Western blot.
2.12. Localization of Malic Enzyme in Eh
Cells were washed three times with 1X PBS and fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde
for 10 min on ice. After fixation, the cells were washed again three times with 1X PBS
and permeabilized with 0.01% Triton X-100. The cells were then incubated with a specific
anti-EhME antibody raised in rabbit (1:100 dilution) for 1 h at room temperature, followed
by incubation with an anti-rabbit IgG TRITC-conjugated secondary antibody (1:500). The
cells were subsequently stained with DAPI (1µg m−1) for nuclear staining, washed with 1X
PBS, and visualized by confocal microscopy (FV 1000, Olympus, Japan). Images obtained
were analyzed and processed using FluoView1000 software.
2.13. Autoligand Assay
An auto-ligand assay was performed to test the binding ability of recombinant EhME
with its own membrane. Approximately 2 × 104 Eh cells per well were grown in a 24-well
plate for 4 h. One set of cells was treated with trypsin (10 mg mL−1) for 15 min at 37 ◦C,
while the other was untreated. The cells were then fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde for
10 min. The FITC-labeled recombinant enzyme was added to the cell monolayer and
incubated at 37 ◦C for 1 h. In another experiment, cells were grown at pH 6.0 for
1 h and then stained with anti-EhME antibody, followed by TRITC-labeled secondary
anti-IgG rabbit antibody as described above. The samples were visualized under a
confocal microscope.
2.14. Adherence Assay
For the adherence assay, human colon cancer cell lines HT-29 and Caco-2 were grown
as monolayers. Caco-2 cells were cultured for 4 days, while HT-29 cells were cultured
for 12–18 h. Prior to adding the labeled protein, the cells were washed with 1X PBS, and
20 µg mL−1 labeled protein was added to each well and allowed to bind for 1 h at room
temperature. In one set of experiments, HT-29 cells were incubated with spent media
separated from Eh cell cultures grown at pH 6.0 for 2 h. Non-specifically bound EhME was
washed away with 1X PBS, and the cells were fixed with 2% paraformaldehyde. The cells
were then observed under a confocal microscope.
2.15. Crystallization
Concentrated EhME (50 mg mL−1) was subjected to preliminary crystallization trials
with Crystal Screen and Crystal Screen 2 (Hampton Research, Aliso Viejo, CA, USA),
where 2 µL of protein was mixed with 2 µL of reservoir solution in the sitting drop vapor
Pathogens 2025, 14, 277 6 of 20
diffusion method at 298 K. Tiny crystals appeared in 2.0 M (NH4)2SO4. An attempt was
made to improve the quality of the crystals by introducing acetate buffer. Fine screening
with pH ranges from 5.0 to 5.5 and varied concentrations of (NH 4)2SO4 in the hanging
drop vapor diffusion method were carried out. Good quality crystals appeared from the
condition consisting of 1.5 M (NH 4)2SO4 and 0.1 M CH 3COONa at pH 5.0 after 7 days
at 298 K. A platinum heavy atom derivative of the crystal was prepared by soaking in
2 mM Na[Pt(CN)4].
2.16. Data Collection and Processing
EhME crystals were quickly soaked in a crystal solution containing 1.5 M (NH4)2SO4,
0.1 M CH 3COONa at pH 5.0, and 12% ( v/v) glycerol and mounted. X-ray diffraction
data were collected on an in-house Rigaku RaxisIV ++ image plate detector using CuKα
X-rays generated by the Rigaku Micromax HF007 rotating anode generator in a nitro-
gen stream at 100K (Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan). The crystal-to-detector distance was kept at
180 mm and rotated a total of 360 ◦, with 0.5 ◦ oscillation per frame. The native crystal
diffracted up to a resolution of 2.2 Å. A total of 720 frames were collected and processed
with d*TREK [20] with space group P4 3212. Heavy atom data were collected using the
same in-house diffractometer. Data processing statistics are summarized in Table 1.

2.17. Phasing, Model Building, Refinement, and Validation
Attempts to obtain the phase from homologous structures using molecular replace-
ment failed. The phases were obtained using the SIRAS method using the platinum
derivative. The heavy atom substructure was determined by SHELXD [21]. AutoSHARP
automatically interpreted initial sites and calculated residual maps [22]. Density modifica-
tion was performed using SOLOMON [23], followed by automatic model building using
ARP/wARP . The resulting model, which contained 80% of the total residues in the asym-
metric unit, was further subjected to manual model building in COOT [24] and refined to
Rwork and Rfree values of 17.9% and 24.4%, respectively, in REFMAC [25]. Detailed phasing
and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1. The final model was validated using
PROCHECK [26] and SFCHECK in the CCP4. The atomic coordinates and experimental
structural factor amplitudes for EhME have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB),
with accession number 3NV9.
2.18. Computational Docking Analysis
Computational docking of ATP to EhME was performed independently using
Autodock [27] and the Swissdock server [28]. Ligand (ATP) and receptor (EhME; PDB ID
3NV9) coordinates were retrieved from the PDB and used for blind docking after energy
minimization. To employ the EhME dimer in the docking process, the entire EhME dimer
was selected as the receptor. Docking clusters were selected based on the lowest free energy
of the complex.
3. Results
3.1. Malic Enzyme Is an NADP+ Dependent Enzyme
For biochemical characterization, EhME was heterologously overexpressed in bac-
terial cells. The purified EhME exhibited an apparent molecular mass of 53 kDa on 12%
SDS–PAGE, and its identity was further confirmed through Western blot analysis using
an anti-His antibody (Figure 1A). The purified enzyme catalyzed the oxidative decarboxy-
lation of L-malate to pyruvate, utilizing NADP + as a coenzyme. The Michaelis-Menten
constants (Km) for L-malate and NADP + were determined to be 0.57 ± 0.08 mM and
46.67 ± 6.0 µM, respectively. The catalytic turnover rates (k cat) were 41.7 s −1 for
L-malate and 14.57 s −1 for NADP+ (Figure 1B). The k cat values are determined by di-
viding maximum reaction velocity (Vm) with the total enzyme concentration [Et] where
the Vm for the L-malate and NADP + were determined to be 7.84 ± 0.26 mM s −1 and
2.75 ± 0.12 mM s−1, respectively. Lineweaver-Burk plots generated at varying concentra-
tions of L-malate and fixed NADP+ concentrations (0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 mM) showed changes
in both slope and intercept (Figure 1C), indicating that EhME catalyzes the oxidative de-
carboxylation of L-malate via a sequential bi-bi (ternary complex) reaction mechanism.
These findings confirm that the recombinant EhME was purified in an active form. The
kinetic parameters are within similar ranges of the other malic enzymes studied [ 29,30].
Pathogens 2025, 14, 277 8 of 20
Since ATP is known to inhibit malic enzymes (e.g., human ME), ATP-mediated inhibition
of EhMEwas assessed. The inhibition pattern of EhME by ATP was non-competitive with
respect to NADP+ and uncompetitive with respect to L-malate. The inhibition dissociation
constants (Ki) for ATP were 1.63 mM for NADP+ and 0.65 mM for L-malate (Figure 1C).
These results suggest that ATP binds to an allosteric site distinct from the NADP+ binding
site, with the inhibitory effect being influenced by L-malate binding to EhME.

3.2. Malic Enzyme Is an Alternative Enzyme That Activates Metronidazole 
Various oxidoreductases have traditionall y been considered the primary enzymes 
responsible for activating metronidazole (Mtz). However, their loss did not render E. 
histolytica (Eh) or T. vaginalis (Tv) cells resistant to higher doses of Mtz, suggesting the 
existence of an alternative pathway potentially involving malic enzyme (ME). The ability 
of EhME to reduce Mtz was tested using two complementary methods: (i) broth dilution 
assay and (ii) E-test. An Mtz-sensitive E. coli JM109 strain was transformed to ectopically 
express EhME. The JM109 cells transformed with the empty pQE30 vector showed an 
IC₅₀ value of 32 µg ml
−1. In contrast, cells expressing EhME displayed a significantly re-
duced IC₅₀ o f  6 . 2 5  µ g  m l−1 (Figure 2A). These results were further validated using the 
Epsilometer test (E-test; AB Biodisc, Sweden). When an Mtz E-strip containing a gradient 
of drug concentrations (0.156–256 µg ml−1) was applied, a distinct zone of inhibition was 
observed in plates with JM109 cells expressing EhME, whereas the control plates with 
cells transformed with the empty vector showed no comparable effect (Figure 2B). To 
investigate whether sustained Mtz activation in Eh is linked to the drug influencing

These findings confirm that the recombinant EhME was purified in an active form. The 
kinetic parameters are within similar ranges of the other malic enzymes studied [29,30]. 
Since ATP is known to inhibit malic enzymes (e.g., human ME), ATP-mediated inhibition 
of EhMEwas assessed. The inhibition pattern of EhME by ATP was non-competitive with 
respect to NADP ⁺ and uncompetitive with respec t to L-malate. The inhibition 
dissociation constants (Kᵢ) for ATP were 1.63 mM for NADP ⁺ and 0.65 mM for L-malate 
(Figure 1C). These results suggest that ATP bind s to an allosteric site distinct from the 
NADP⁺ binding site, with the inhibitory effect being influenced by L-malate binding to 
EhME.

the existence of an alternative pathway potentially involving malic enzyme (ME). The
ability of EhME to reduce Mtz was tested using two complementary methods: (i) broth

topically express EhME. The JM109 cells transformed with the empty pQE30 vector showed
an IC50 value of 32 µg mL−1. In contrast, cells expressing EhME displayed a significantly

whether sustained Mtz activation in Eh is linked to the drug influencing EhME expression,

gel. Black arrows indicate the corresponding base pair positions. 
In cells treated with 12.0 mM Mtz, EhME expression increased by 1.7-fold, likely due 
to cell death caused by the higher drug concentration (Figure 2C). A similar trend was 
observed in Western blot analysis (Figure S1). These findings suggest that Mtz activation 
in Eh is a self-driven process where Mtz itse lf induces the expression of EhME, enabling 
its metabolism. The reduction in metronidazole in the presence of malate, NADH dehy-
drogenase, and ferredoxin could be confirmed by EPR analysis. 
3.3. Malic Enzyme Helps Attach Eh to the Enteric Cell Surface 
In recent studies, a hydrogenosomal NADP ⁺-dependent decarboxylating malic en-
zyme from the protozoan T. vaginalis, known as AP65, has been implicated in adhesion to 
host cells [19]. A pairwise alignment revealed  that TvAP65 exhibits significant sequence 
similarity to EhME (Figure S2), which is the single malic enzyme isoform encoded by the 
Eh genome. To determine if EhME plays a sim ilar role, we investigated its intracellular 
distribution through immunolocalization. Conf ocal microscopy revealed that EhME is 
predominantly localized in th e cytosol as distinct puncta  (Figure 3A). Many adhe-
sion-associated proteins are secreted in response to environmental triggers, such as a de-
crease in pH [31]. The release of EhME into the extracellular environment was assessed via 
Western blot analysis at different ambient pH levels, with maximum secretion detected at 
pH 6.0 (Figure 3B).

To explore whether the released EhME could attach to a host and Eh cells, we per-
formed an autoligand assay in which non-pe rmeabilized Eh cells were incubated with 
FITC-tagged recombinant EhME (rEhME). Co nfocal microscopy co nfirmed that rEhME 
firmly bound to the surface of Eh cells but failed to bind to the surface of trypsin-treated 
cells (Figure 3C). Additionally, similar experiments were conducted on human enteric 
colon cells, including HT29 and Caco-2 cell s. Immunolocalization demonstrated that 
rEhME was firmly bound to the surface of thes e colon cells (Figure 3D). In contrast, no 
binding was observed on MCF cells, which se rved as a negative control. To confirm 
whether low pH-induced secretion of EhME by Eh cells could bind human enteric cell 
surfaces, Eh cells were grown at pH 6.0, and the spent media were collected and incu-
bated with HT29 cells for 1 h. Immunolocalization showed that the secreted EhME suc-
cessfully attached to the surface of HT29 ce lls (Figure 3E). These findings suggest that 
EhME plays a dual role in maintaining the attachment by binding to both host and 
pathogen cells, highlighting its potential role as a key participant in adhesion processes. 
3.4. Overall Structure of EhME 
The crystal structure of EhME was determined at a resolution of 2.2 Å using the 
platinum single isomorphous replacement with anomalous scattering (SIRAS) method. 
The crystal belongs to space group P4
3212, with two nearly identical monomers in the 
asymmetric unit, exhibiting an RMSD of 0.35 Å across 3581 atoms (Figure 4A). The di-
meric nature of EhME was further validated through gel filtration chromatography. The 
monomer structure is organized into five distinct domains (Figure 4B). The shaft-like 
domain A comprises two N-terminal helices, α1 (residues 10–15) and α2 (residues 20–44), 
along with one C-terminal helix, α21 (residues 470–485). Dimer interface domain B in-
cludes helices α3 (residues 58–64), α4 (residues 67–78), and α5 (residues 82–90). These

firmly bound to the surface of Eh cells but failed to bind to the surface of trypsin-treated
cells (Figure 3C). Additionally, similar experiments were conducted on human enteric colon
cells, including HT29 and Caco-2 cells. Immunolocalization demonstrated that rEhME
was firmly bound to the surface of these colon cells (Figure 3D). In contrast, no binding
was observed on MCF cells, which served as a negative control. To confirm whether low
pH-induced secretion of EhME by Eh cells could bind human enteric cell surfaces, Eh cells
were grown at pH 6.0, and the spent media were collected and incubated with HT29 cells
for 1 h. Immunolocalization showed that the secreted EhME successfully attached to the
surface of HT29 cells (Figure 3E). These findings suggest that EhME plays a dual role in
maintaining the attachment by binding to both host and pathogen cells, highlighting its
potential role as a key participant in adhesion processes.

(residues 58–64), α4 (residues 67–78), andα5 (residues 82–90). These helices intertwine with
the second monomer, forming a knot that stabilizes the active site through inter-monomer

parallel β-strands (β5, β4, β2, and β3) flanked by helices α6–α8. The NADPH binding

It contains five central parallel β-strands (β11, β10, β9, β6, and β7) surrounded by helices
α9–α16. Finally, the helix bundle domain E, an all-helical domain (residues 360–469),
consists of helices α17–α20, forming a three-helix bundle. The extended α20 helix (residues
438–467) aligns with the dimer interface and connects to α21.

3.5. The Entangled Dimer Interface of EhME Is Distinctive from the Metazoan ME 
Unlike the tetrameric configuration observed in many eukaryotic malic enzymes, 
EhME exists strictly as a dimer, as confir med by gel filtration chromatography (Figure 
5A). Prokaryotic malic enzymes with sequence identities of 43–47% to EhME also form 
dimers or tetramers; however, the dimeric fo rms uniquely exhibit an inter-protomer en-
tangled polypeptide at their interface. This entangled conformation appears to be an in-
herent structural feature of prokaryotic MEs, including EhME and is independent of 
crystallization conditions or space groups (Figures 5B and S3). The dimer is stabilized by 
a two-fold symmetry axis perpendicular to the inter-dimer β1-β1′ sheet. The entangled 
region begins at th e EhME-specific motif 
46GK46, where the polypeptide chain of one 
monomer enters the other protomer, forming the β1-β1′ interaction. Helices α3, α4, and 
α5 from one monomer pass through the domain A and the core structure of the other 
monomer before re-entering their respective structures near the N-terminus of β2 (se-
quence 90GNF92). This creates a 48-residue entangled region. The axes of helices α3, α4, and 
α5 are oriented perpendicularly to their counterparts in the opposing monomer (α3′, α4′, 
and α5′). Sequence alignments between eukaryotic and prokaryotic MEs reveal significant 
structural differences in the region spanning from the N-terminus of β1 to the C-terminus 
of α7 in EhME (Figure 6). Notably, the 45GK46 motif in EhME is replaced by NEK in eukar-
yotic MEs.

to their counterparts in the opposing monomer (α3′, α4′, and α5′). Sequence alignments
between eukaryotic and prokaryotic MEs reveal significant structural differences in the
region spanning from the N-terminus of β1 to the C-terminus of α7 in EhME (Figure 6).
Notably, the 45GK46 motif in EhME is replaced by NEK in eukaryotic MEs.
Additionally, eukaryotic MEs contain two insertions—termed the “tyrosine insertion”
and “lysine-insertion”—absent in EhME. These insertions likely evolved to avoid the
formation of the entanglement in eukaryotic enzymes. In EhME, the absence of these
insertions results in altered interaction patterns, converting intra-monomer interactions
seen in eukaryotic MEs into inter-monomer interactions. For example, the inter-monomer
spanning helices (α3, α4, and α5) of one protomer interact with the 44KGKI47 region of the
opposing protomer (Figure 5B). The swapping of secondary structure positions across the
termini of α3–α4–α5 facilitates the β1-β1′ interaction. Detailed residues involved in the
knot region are summarized in Table 2.

3.6. The Composite Active Site of EhME
The catalytic triad of EhME is composed of Tyr65, Lys120, and Asp193. Tyr65 and Lys120
are part of the Tyr and Lys motifs, respectively. Due to the knotted structure of EhME,
two monomers engage in inter-monomer swapping of these motifs, contributing to the for-
mation of each other’s active site (Figure 5B). The Tyr motif (65YTPGV69), located between
α3′ and α4′, is positioned near Lys 120 as a result of the knotted structure (Figure 7). In
contrast, metazoan malic enzymes (MEs) lack this inter-monomer knot and each monomer
possesses its own distinct active site. The Tyr motif in metazoan MEs is typically “YTPTV”,
with a key difference at the fifth position where Gly is replaced by Thr. This alteration
may be essential for ensuring the correct orientation of helices α6 and α7 in metazoan MEs.
The EhME Lys motif ( 116VMEGKA121), located within helix α6, includes Glu118, which
forms hydrogen bonds with the 45GK46 motif and the Cα backbone of α5. A comparison
of the structures of metazoan MEs with EhME reveals that the inter-monomer spanning
region (α3, α4, and α5) in EhME is replaced by the α5–α6–α7 intra-monomer region in
metazoan MEs.

(α3, α4, and α5) in EhME is replaced by the α5–α6–α7 intra-monomer region in metazoan 
MEs. 
 
Figure 7. The composite active site and metal binding site of EhME. (A). Monomers are designated 
by different colors. Catalytic Tyr 65′ is located on the intermonomer spanning α3′–α4′ region. Cata-
lytic Lys120 is situated on α6, and Asp193 is a part of the metal binding motif 2 ( β5–α9 loop). A glyc-
erol molecule, GOL1, at the overlapping position of  the substrate binding region, is fitted in the 
Fo-Fc difference density contoured at 2.8 σ cut-offs. ( B). EhME (green) metal binding site is com-
pared with PglME (magenta). The substrate mimi cs OXA (oxaloacetate) and occupies the PglME 
active site. The Mn2+ of PglME is shown. 
This structural divergence suggests that the shortening of the N-terminal sequence 
in EhME might be responsible for its more rigid, compact structure and proper orienta-
tion of the catalytic residues, which is essential for knot formation. The reason for main-
taining a composite active site in EhME remains unclear, but one possibility is that it 
serves to preserve structural compactness. Confocal imaging indicates that the enzyme is 
secreted into the intercellular milieu, an environment subject to mechanical stress and 
fluctuating conditions. Unlike metazoan MEs, EhME does not have long loop insertions 
and has more structured N- and C-terminal regions. In fact, these regions in EhME are 
even more structured and elongated compar ed to the N- and C-terminal regions ob-
served in prokaryotic MEs (as seen in PDB st ructures). The structured nature of these 
regions cannot be attributed to crystal contacts, further suggesting that they play an im-
portant role in the enzyme’s stability. Th e knotted-dimer structure further strengthens 
this compactness by stabilizing the enzyme through dimer interactions. Thus, the mutual 
sharing of the active sites in EhME likely helps retain the proper conformation of the ac-
tive site, contributing to the overall structural integrity and functional efficiency of the 
enzyme. 
3.7. Metal-Binding Residues in EhME 
Mn
2+ or Mg 2+ ions are essential for the catalysis of malic enzymes, not only for 
structural stability but also for the proper positioning of malate and oxaloacetate sub-
strates [32]. In EhME, two key metal-bi nding motifs have been identified: 
165Xh(Q/N)XhEDXh170 and 191(W/F)(H/N)DDX195 (Figure 6). The metal ion is octahedrally 
coordinated by Glu168, Asp169, Asp194, two carboxylate groups from the substrates, and a 
water molecule (Figure 7B) [33]. Among these acidic residues, Asp194 plays a particularly 
crucial role in metal binding [34]. In the EhME structure (Figure 7B), a water molecule 
occupies the putative metal-binding site, br idging hydrogen bonding interactions be-
Figure 7. The composite active site and metal binding site of EhME. (A). Monomers are designated by

is located on the intermonomer spanning α3′–α4′ region. Catalytic
Lys120 is situated on α6, and Asp193 is a part of the metal binding motif 2 (β5–α9 loop). A glycerol
molecule, GOL1, at the overlapping position of the substrate binding region, is fitted in the Fo-Fc

PglME (magenta). The substrate mimics OXA (oxaloacetate) and occupies the PglME active site. The

This structural divergence suggests that the shortening of the N-terminal sequence in
EhME might be responsible for its more rigid, compact structure and proper orientation of
the catalytic residues, which is essential for knot formation. The reason for maintaining
a composite active site in EhME remains unclear, but one possibility is that it serves to
preserve structural compactness. Confocal imaging indicates that the enzyme is secreted
into the intercellular milieu, an environment subject to mechanical stress and fluctuating
conditions. Unlike metazoan MEs, EhME does not have long loop insertions and has
more structured N- and C-terminal regions. In fact, these regions in EhME are even
more structured and elongated compared to the N- and C-terminal regions observed in
prokaryotic MEs (as seen in PDB structures). The structured nature of these regions cannot
be attributed to crystal contacts, further suggesting that they play an important role in the
Pathogens 2025, 14, 277 15 of 20
enzyme’s stability. The knotted-dimer structure further strengthens this compactness by
stabilizing the enzyme through dimer interactions. Thus, the mutual sharing of the active
sites in EhME likely helps retain the proper conformation of the active site, contributing to
the overall structural integrity and functional efficiency of the enzyme.
3.7. Metal-Binding Residues in EhME
Mn2+ or Mg2+ ions are essential for the catalysis of malic enzymes, not only for struc-
tural stability but also for the proper positioning of malate and oxaloacetate substrates [32].
In EhME, two key metal-binding motifs have been identified: 165Xh(Q/N)XhEDXh170
and 191(W/F)(H/N)DDX195 (Figure 6). The metal ion is octahedrally coordinated by
Glu168, Asp169, Asp194, two carboxylate groups from the substrates, and a water molecule
(Figure 7B) [ 33]. Among these acidic residues, Asp 194 plays a particularly crucial role
in metal binding [34]. In the EhME structure (Figure 7B), a water molecule occupies the
putative metal-binding site, bridging hydrogen bonding interactions between the protein
and a glycerol molecule. Notably, Gln195, a residue in the second metal-binding motif, is
replaced by Ile in metazoan MEs. This substitution may alter the charge density around
Asp194, potentially affecting the metal-binding affinity. Additionally, Asp193 is predicted
to influence the protonation state of Lys120, facilitating the role of Lys120 as the catalytic
base [34].
3.8. Coenzyme Specificity of EhME
The coenzyme binding region in malic enzymes is highly conserved, although the prefer-
ence for either NADP+ or NAD+ is determined by specific amino acid sequences [35]. Kinetic
analysis of EhME reveals its preference for NADP+, with a Km value of 0.57± 0.08 mM.
The NADP+ binding site was identified by comparing the EhME structure with that
of NADP+-bound eukaryotic ME (PDB: 1GQ2) and the bacterial PhoME-NAD complex
(PDB: 2DVM) (Figure 8A). This comparison suggests that the loop connecting β9 and α15
undergoes a reorientation to accommodate NADP+ binding in EhME. The adenosine moiety
of NADP+ interacts with a cleft formed by the C-terminal ends of β6 and β7, primarily
through hydrophobic interactions. The adenosine 2′ ribose phosphate is positioned through
interactions with the 252DX2-3G255 motif in the β7-β8 loop and the 226GAG228 motif in the
β6-α11 loop. This placement is further supported by the presence of a sulfate ion near these
motifs (Figure 8B). The sulfate is in hydrogen bonding proximity to Ser253 (from the 252DX2-
3G255 motif) and Ala227 (from the 226GAG228 motif), as well as Lys273. Both Ser253 and Lys273
are crucial for the specificity of NADP+ binding in malic enzymes [36]. The pyrophosphate
group of NADP+ interacts with Arg101 from the β2-α6 loop. Additionally, the β10-α16 loop,
containing the 327ANP329 sequence, is located near the nicotinamide ribose group, helping
orient the nicotinamide ring properly [37]. The loop 348TGRXDXPNQ356, linking β11 and
α17 in EhME, is responsible for positioning the nicotinamide moiety. In contrast, the
corresponding loop in eukaryotic MEs forms a β-turn, which is absent in EhME (Figure 6).
The flexibility of this region in EhME may allow the nicotinamide ring of NADP+ to adopt
two different conformations, as observed in AsmME [38]. A recent molecular dynamics
simulation study found that the cofactor can also take collapsed conformation while binding
to ME, as observed in NADP(H) phosphatase [30,39].

tween the protein and a glycerol molecule. Notably, Gln 195, a residue in the second met-
al-binding motif, is replaced by Ile in metazoan MEs. This substitution may alter the 
charge density around Asp 194, potentially affecting the metal-binding affinity. Addition-
ally, Asp193 is predicted to influence the protonation state of Lys 120, facilitating the role of 
Lys120 as the catalytic base [34]. 
3.8. Coenzyme Specificity of EhME 
The coenzyme binding region in malic enzy mes is highly conserved, although the 
preference for either NADP⁺ or NAD⁺ is determined by speciﬁc amino acid sequences [35]. 
Kinetic analysis of EhME reveals its preference for NADP⁺, with a Km value of 0.57 ± 0.08 
mM. 
The NADP⁺ binding site was identiﬁed by comparing the EhME structure with that 
of NADP⁺-bound eukaryotic ME (PDB: 1GQ2) and the bacterial PhoME-NAD complex 
(PDB: 2DVM) (Figure 8A). This comparison suggests that the loop connecting β9 and α15 
undergoes a reorientation to accommodate NADP ⁺ binding in EhME. The adenosine 
moiety of NADP⁺ interacts with a cleft formed by the C-terminal ends of β6 and β7, pri-
marily through hydrophobic in teractions. The adenosine 2 ′ ribose phosphate is posi-
tioned through interactions with the 252DX2-3G255 motif in the β7-β8 loop and the 226GAG228 
motif in the β6-α11 loop. This placement is further supported by the presence of a sulfate 
ion near these motifs (Figure 8B). The sulfate is in hydrogen bonding proximity to Ser 253 
(from the 252DX2-3G255 motif) and Ala227 (from the 226GAG228 motif), as well as Lys 273. Both 
Ser253 and Lys 273 are crucial for the speci ﬁcity of NADP ⁺ binding in malic enzymes [36]. 
The pyrophosphate group of NADP ⁺ interacts with Arg 101 from the β2-α6 loop. Addi-
tionally, the β10-α16 loop, containing the 327ANP329 sequence, is located near the nico-
tinamide ribose group, helping orient the nicotinamide ring properly [37]. The loop 
348TGRXDXPNQ356, linking β11 and α17 in EhME, is responsible for positioning the nico-
tinamide moiety. In contrast, the corresponding loop in eukaryotic MEs forms a β-turn, 
which is absent in EhME (Figure 6). The flexibility of this region in EhME may allow the 
nicotinamide ring of NADP ⁺ to adopt two di ﬀerent conformations, as observed in As-
mME [38]. A recent molecular dynamics simulation study found that the cofactor can 
also take collapsed conformation while binding to ME, as observed in NADP(H) phos-
phatase [30,39].

4. Discussion
The malic enzyme (ME) from parasitic protozoa E. histolytica is suggested to be associ-
ated with the prodrug Metronidazole (Mtz). The closely related T. vaginalis Mtz-resistant
strain has also been reported to alter its ME expression pattern, which is a secretory
protein [40,41]. Upon characterization, EhME was found to be NADP+-specific and ATP-
inhibited during oxidative decarboxylation. ATP is known to act as a competitive inhibitor
in both human mitochondrial malic enzyme (HumME) and T. vaginalis (Tv) hydrogenoso-
mal malic enzyme (TvME) with respect to both NADP+ and L-malate [42–44]. However,
kinetic analysis of recombinant EhME (rEhME) indicates that ATP exhibits non-competitive
inhibition with NADP + and uncompetitive inhibition with L-malate. Docking studies
support that ATP binds at the dimer interface and affects the active site via the α2-β1 loop
(Figures S4 and S5). The ATP-mediated inhibition of the malic enzyme suggests a feedback
regulation mechanism in the metabolic pathway [17]. Interestingly, while malic enzyme
activation is not entirely negated by the deficiency of PFOR, a malic enzyme-dependent
activation of Mtz has been reported in Tv [5]. A similar Mtz activation by EhME via this
alternative pathway is also expected in E. histolytica (Eh). Complementation assays and
E-tests (Figure 2A,B) demonstrate that overexpression of EhME in bacterial cells increases
their susceptibility to Mtz.
Furthermore, EhME expression in Eh cells increases in a dose-dependent manner
upon exposure to Mtz, as demonstrated by sqRT-PCR and Western blot analyses (Figure 2C
and Figure S1). A similar trend was observed in Tv, where malic enzyme expression was
markedly higher compared to other enzymes involved in Mtz activation. However, this
expression declines once the cells develop resistance to Mtz [4]. From these findings, we
conclude that EhME, along with enzymes like nitroreductase and PFOR, plays a crucial
role in Mtz activation in Eh. The elevated expression of malic enzyme is likely a result of
feed-forward regulation, continuing until the available Mtz is metabolized, albeit at the
parasite’s own peril. In response to a lowering pH, EhME is secreted to the extracellular
space, where it would typically reside in cytosolic vesicles (Figure 3A). Similarly to some
Pathogens 2025, 14, 277 17 of 20
bacterial metabolic enzymes involved in pathogenesis [45], EhME lacks a signal peptide,
making its secretion process unique. A hydrogenosomal homolog of EhME, AP65 from
Tv, exhibits similar properties [46]. As EhME is the only malic enzyme found in Eh, we
aimed to determine if it shares functionality with its counterparts. Confocal microscopy
confirmed the cell adhesion properties of rEhME. Upon incubation of rEhME with Eh cells
or human enteric cells (Caco-2 and HT29), it was evident that EhME binds efficiently to
both. This property is vital for Eh as it likely aids in the parasite’s ability to attach to host
cells, complementing other attachment proteins such as Gal/GalNAc lectins [47].
To investigate the functional characteristics of EhME further, we determined its struc-
ture. Unlike most metazoan malic enzymes, which are typically homotetramers [36], EhME
exists strictly as a dimer, with the two protomers deeply entangled. The N- and C-terminal
regions of each protomer come into close proximity, forming a loop-like structure that
secures a portion of the second protomer, resulting in a knot-like arrangement. This
polypeptide chain entanglement is classified as type II entanglement [48]. Such unique en-
tangled morphology has not been observed in eukaryotic malic enzyme structures reported
thus far. However, a similar entangled structure has been identified in the malic enzyme
from Candidatus, a prokaryotic organism [9].
While knotted folds within a single polypeptide chain have been known for over
a decade [49], inter-monomer knotted structures are much rarer. Recent studies [ 50,51]
classify EhME among a select group of proteins exhibiting this unique structural feature.
Notably, most knotted proteins identified so far are enzymes [52], and these knots are far
from evolutionary anomalies–instead, they often confer significant functional advantages.
For instance, in ubiquitin hydrolase, a knotted structure helps the enzyme evade the pro-
teasome, simultaneously releasing its cargo for degradation [52]. In alkaline phosphatase,
a slip knot enhances thermostability [53]. Similarly, in carbonic anhydrase [54] and phy-
tochrome [55], knotted regions contribute to greater mechanical strength and stability. In
EhME, the knotted structure appears to enhance structural resilience, allowing the enzyme
to withstand mechanical and environmental stresses associated with its secretion. While
the precise functional role of this knot remains unclear, it is evident that it helps maintain
catalytic efficiency while ensuring a compact architecture. It is plausible that EhME cat-
alyzes the conversion of malate to pyruvate at the Host–Pathogen interface, where the
resulting pyruvate (pKa ≈ 2.5) may contribute to local pH reduction. This acidification
could, in turn, trigger the release of pathogenic cytolytic proteins [31].
Unlike eukaryotic malic enzymes, EhME lacks the β1-β1′ interaction at its dimeric
interface. Instead, the corresponding slot between the domain A shaft and the core structure
is occupied by theα5, α6, and α7 helices of the same polypeptide chain. Additionally, the N-
and C-terminal regions of eukaryotic MEs are less compact compared to EhME. The NADP+-
specific conserved motifs are located within domain C, and structural superimposing the
holo-EhME with the apo-structure of pigeon liver ME confirms that the NADP+ binding
region is conserved (Figure 8A). Notably, a sulfate molecule in the crystal structure mimics
the 2′-ribose phosphate of NADP+ at its binding site (Figure 8B). The metal binding site of
EhME is highly conserved, as demonstrated by multiple sequence alignment (Figure 6).
The enzyme’s active site, located within the protein’s core, is surrounded by helices from
both monomers. Key catalytic residues within the active site are conserved, and a glycerol
molecule was observed bound at this site. The evolution of EhME’s unique knotted
structure grants it remarkable functional versatility. However, further structure-centric
functional studies are needed to fully elucidate the implications of this feature.
