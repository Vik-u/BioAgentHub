Wild-type C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 is known to possess two enzymes
with anaplerotic (C4-directed) carboxylation activity, n amely phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxylase (PEPCx) and pyruvate carboxylase (PCx). On the other hand, C3-directed
decarboxylation can be catalyzed by the three enzymes phosp hoenolpyruvate
carboxykinase (PEPCk), oxaloacetate decarboxylase (ODx) , and malic enzyme (ME). The
resulting high metabolic ﬂexibility at the anaplerotic nod e compromises the unambigous
determination of its carbon and energy ﬂux in C. glutamicum wild type. To circumvent
this problem we performed a comprehensive analysis of selec ted single or double
deletion mutants in the anaplerosis of wild-type C. glutamicum under deﬁned D-glucose
conditions. By applying well-controlled lab-scale biorea ctor experiments in combination
with untargeted proteomics, quantitative metabolomics an d whole-genome sequencing
hitherto unknown, and sometimes counter-intuitive, genot ype-phenotype relationships
in these mutants could be unraveled. In comparison to the wil d type the four mutants
C. glutamiucm )Delta1pyc, C. glutamiucm )Delta1pyc )Delta1odx, C. glutamiucm )Delta1ppc )Delta1pyc, and
C. glutamiucm )Delta1pck showed lowered speciﬁc growth rates and D-glucose uptake
rates, underlining the importance of PCx and PEPCk activity for a balanced carbon
and energy ﬂux at the anaplerotic node. Most interestingly, the strain C. glutamiucm
)Delta1ppc )Delta1pyc could be evolved to grow on D-glucose as the only source of carbon
and energy, whereas this combination was previously consid ered lethal. The prevented
anaplerotic carboxylation activity of PEPCx and PCx was fou nd in the evolved strain to
be compensated by an up-regulation of the glyoxylate shunt, potentially in combination
with the 2-methylcitrate cycle.

INTRODUCTION
C. glutamicum is one of the most important organisms for
industrial biotechnology and the current product spectrum th at is
accessible with this host comprises proteinogenic as well as n on-
proteinogenic amino acids, organic acids, diamines, vitami ns,
aromates, and alcohols (
Becker et al., 2018; Kogure and Inui,
2018). Most production strains have been generated by classical
mutagenesis and selection, as well as by targeted and evolut ionary
metabolic engineering approaches ( Lee and Wendisch, 2017;
Stella et al., 2019 ). With the aim to enhance predictability of
cellular functions and to reduce interference with heterol ogous
pathways new chassis strains were introduced ( Baumgart et al.,
2013, 2018; Unthan et al., 2015 ). Several targeted and untargeted
proteomics methods were developed, enabling relative, and
absolute quantiﬁcation of cytosolic as well as membrane-bo und
proteins (
Fränzel et al., 2009; Voges and Noack, 2012; Trötschel
et al., 2013; Küberl et al., 2014; Voges et al., 2015; Noack et al.,
2017).
At the phosphoenolpyruvate-pyruvate-oxaloacetate node
C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 (wild type) is known to possess
two enzymes with anaplerotic (C4-directed) carboxylation
activity, namely phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPCx)
and pyruvate carboxylase (PCx). On the other hand, C3-
directed decarboxylation can be catalyzed by the three enzy mes
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCk), oxaloacetate
decarboxylase (ODx), and malic enzyme (ME). While all
enzymes show in vitro activity in cells grown in deﬁned
D-glucose media (
Cocaign-Bousquet et al., 1996; Uy et al.,
1999; Klaﬄ and Eikmanns, 2010; Blombach et al., 2013 ), only
PEPCx and PCx are currently considered as dependent essentia l
anaplerotic enzymes under these conditions ( Figure 1).
Recently, the anaplerotic node of C. glutamicum, which
represents a very ﬂexible knot for diverting the carbon and
energy ﬂux introduced by diﬀerent potential substrates, has
again attracted our attention. Following detailed mathema tical
modeling and computational analyses, we could prove that only
certain anaplerotic deletion mutants allow to uniquely deter mine
the anaplerotic ﬂuxes (
Kappelmann et al., 2016 ).
Following shake ﬂask experiments, it was shown that a
single inactivation of either PEPCx, PCx, ODx or ME in wild-
type C. glutamicum has no eﬀect on biomass growth (
Peters-
Wendisch et al., 1993, 1998; Gourdon et al., 2000; Klaﬄ and
Eikmanns, 2010
). The only exception was found for PEPCk,
whose inactivation resulted in a lower growth rate ( Riedel et al.,
2001). In contrast, the combined removal of PEPCx and PCx
is thought to be lethal for C. glutamicum when grown under
glycolytic conditions as no other carboxylation reaction e nables
replenishment of tricarboxylic acid intermediates ( Peters-
Wendisch et al., 1998 ). Recently, Schwentner et al. were able to
evolve C. glutamicum )Delta1ppc )Delta1pyc to grow on CGXII medium
with 20 g L −1 D-glucose and 1 g L −1 yeast extract (or alternatively
1 mM L-glutamate) ( Schwentner et al., 2018 ). Comparative
whole-genome sequencing revealed isocitrate dehydrogena se
(ICD) as consistent target and the identiﬁed mutations coul d be
linked to diminished ICD activities as well as increased act ivities
of the glyoxylate shunt enzymes isocitrate lyase (ICL) and m alate
synthase (MS). Operation of the glyoxylate shunt can substitut e
for the missing carboxylation reactions to replenish oxaloac etate
required for growth. Interestingly, on pure D-glucose media this
evolution failed in the study reported ( Schwentner et al., 2018 ).
In our study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of
selected single or double deletion mutants in the anaplerosis
of wild-type C. glutamicumunder deﬁned D-glucose conditions
without other carbon supplements. By applying well-controlled
lab-scale bioreactor experiments in combination with untar geted
proteomics, quantitative metabolomics and whole-genome
sequencing hitherto unknown genotype-phenotype relationshi ps
in these mutants could be unraveled and these are discussed i n
detail with regard to published data.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial Strains
All strains, plasmids and oligonucleotids used in this study
are listed in Table 1. The C. glutamicum WT as well as the
single deletion mutants )Delta1pyc, )Delta1malE, )Delta1pck are from
Blombach
et al. (2013) . The double deletion mutant )Delta1ppc )Delta1pyc is
described in Schwentner et al. (2018) . The three remaining
double deletion mutants )Delta1pyc )Delta1odx, )Delta1ppc )Delta1malE and )Delta1pck
)Delta1malE were constructed by chromosomal inactivation of the
ODx gene odx in C. glutamicum )Delta1pyc, as well as the ME gene
malE in C. glutamicum )Delta1pck and C. glutamicum )Delta1ppc using
the plasmids pK19mobsacB- )Delta1odx and pK19mobsacB- )Delta1malE.
Isolation of plasmids from Escherichia coli was performed as
described elsewhere ( Eikmanns et al., 1994 ). Plasmid DNA
transfer into C. glutamicum was carried out by electroporation
and recombinant strains were selected on Luria–Bertani Bra in
Heart Infusion agar plates containing appropriate concentrati ons
of kanamycin (50 µ g mL −1) ( Van Der Rest et al., 1999 ).
The replacement at the chromosomal locus was veriﬁed by
colony-PCR using primers odxfow/odxrev and Co-malE1/Co-
malE1, respectively (
Klaﬄ and Eikmanns, 2010; Blombach et al.,
2011). Subsequently, shaking ﬂasks with CGXII preculture
medium containing 1% D-glucose (w v −1) were inoculated
with the corresponding strains ( Unthan et al., 2014 ). Each
culture was harvested during the late exponential phase follo wing
centrifugation at 4,500 rpm for 10 min, resuspension in sterile
saline and ﬁnally in 20% (v v −1) glycerol solution in sterile 0.9%
(w v −1) NaCl in distilled water. From this solution cryo stocks
were prepared and immediately stored at −80◦C. The )Delta1ppc )Delta1pyc
mutant was able to grow on acetate, from which a corresponding
cryo-culture was produced.

C. glutamicum )Delta1ppc )Delta1pyc was grown in microtiter plates in
a BioLector parallel cultivation system (m2p-labs). Flowerpl ates
with optodes for optical pH and dissolved oxygen (DO)
measurements were employed. A cryo-culture for inoculation
was washed once with sterile saline and resuspended in D-
glucose-free CGXII medium. From this inoculum 50 µ L were
transferred into each well containing 950 µ L 1% D-glucose

medium. The plates were sterilely sealed and incubated at 30 ◦C
at 1,300 rpm.
For whole-genome sequencing, 200 µ L of a well-inoculated at
ODinit = 1 (see Supplementary Figure 1 ) and after growth has
ceased was used to inoculate a subsequent shaking ﬂask cultu re,
from which a cryo-culture was produced. From this cryo-cultu re
a sample was generated for whole-genome sequencing using the
Illumina platform followed by sequence analysis as described
elsewhere (
Kranz et al., 2017 ).
Bioreactor Cultivations
C. glutamicum deletion strains were cultivated in a
DASGIP parallel fermentation system (Eppendorf).
Bioreactor cultivations of C. glutamicum strains were
carried out with deﬁned CGXII medium containing 1%
D-glucose and 0.1% undiluted Antifoam 204 but no 3-(N-
Morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) buﬀer (
Unthan
et al., 2014 ). Bioreactors were inoculated from a preculture in
CGXII medium buﬀered with 42 g L −1 MOPS at pH 7 which
was inoculated directly from a cryo-culture of each strain in
80% 0.9% NaCl/20% glycerol (v v −1) stored at −80◦C. During
bioreactor cultivations DO levels were maintained above 30 %
by adjusting stirrer speed and oxygen content of the inlet air .
The gassing rate was set to 1 vvm and the pH was maintained at
pH 7 by feeding either 4 M NaOH or 4 M HCl. The cultivation
temperature was 30 ◦C.
For quantitative metabolomics, samples from bioreactor
cultivations were drawn into a syringe in technical duplicate
at two time points yielding a total of four technical replicate s
per strain. These time points correspond to target BV

concentrations of 5 µ L mL −1 (OD600 = 6.3) and 10 µ L mL −1
(OD600 = 12.5), covering the mid-exponential phase (cmp.
Supplementary Figure 2 ). The actual BV concentration in each
sample was measured after sampling and used to calculate the
extraction volume.
For untargeted proteomics, sampling was performed directly
after all quenching samples for the metabolome analysis had
been taken. From each reactor samples were drawn in technical
quintuplicate by centrifuging 10 mL of culture broth for each
replicate (10 min, 4500 rpm, GS-15R Centrifuge, Beckman
Coulter). After the supernatant was decanted, the biomass pel lets
were immediately placed in aluminum racks at −20◦C.
For biovolume (BV) measurements, cultivation samples were
diluted 1:200 or 1:2,000 depending on the biomass concentrat ion
in 10 mL CASYton buﬀer (OMNI Life Science GmbH). The size
distribution of the sample was determined by the MultiSizer3
Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter) and the biovolume was
computed by calculating the ﬁrst moment of the distribution,
assuming a spherical shape of the measured cells. Cell dry weigh t
(CDW) was determined by centrifuging 2 mL of a bioreactor
sample in a pre-dried and pre-weighted Eppendorf tube at 13,000
rpm for 7 min. The cells were washed in 1 mL 0.9% (w v −1) NaCl
by resuspension and renewed centrifugation. After decantin g the
supernatant, the pellets were dried for at least 2 days at 80 ◦C.
A correlation between BV in µ L mL −1 and CDW in g L −1
was derived for the )Delta1pyc )Delta1odx, )Delta1ppc )Delta1malE and WT strain (see
Supplementary Figure 3 ) and then applied to calculate the CDW
for all cultivations assuming a standard deviation of 5%.
Estimation of Extracellular Rates
Speciﬁc rates for biomass growth ( µ ) and D-glucose uptake
(πGLC) were estimated using a model-based approach and
process data from the exponential phases of corresponding batch
cultivations. In short, the remaining D-glucose concentration
cGLC(t) at any given time point t is the integral over the
volumetric uptake rate πGLC,vol(t) given in mmol L −1 h−1:
cGLC (t) = cGLC,0 −
∫ t

πGLC,vol (t)dt (1)
Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www.front iersin.org 4 January 2021 | Volume 8 | Article 602936
Kappelmann et al. Analysis of C. glutamicum Anaplerotic Deletion Mutants
Assuming a constant D-glucose uptake from exponentially
growing cells, it holds:
πGLC,vol (t) = πGLC ·X(t) (2)
where X (t) = X0 ·eµ ·t denotes the biomass concentration in µ L
mL−1 or g L −1, depending on whether the biomass signal is BV
or CDW. Inserting Equations (2) into (1) and carrying out the
integration yields:
cGLC (t) = C − πGLC
µ ·X0 ·eµ ·t (3)
with model parameters X0, µ , πGLC, and C, where the latter
absorbs the integration constant and the initial substrate
concentration. Equations (2) and (3) were jointly ﬁtted to t he
experimentally observed time courses of biomass and substra te
concentration, respectively. The end of the exponential phase was
judged by the peak in CO 2 volume fraction in the exhaust gas
stream (see Supplementary Figure 2 ).
The ﬁtting procedure was carried out using a sequential
quadratic programming optimization routine from MATLAB
(Mathworks Inc., R2019b). The estimation of conﬁdence
intervals was based on a parametric Monte Carlo bootstrapping
approach from literature (
Dalman et al., 2013 ). In short, every
available measurement was perturbed independently within th e
normal distribution described by the measurement value and
its standard deviation of the respective measurement. The
perturbation operation consisted in sampling from the normal
distribution of each measurement point and inserting the sam ple
as measurements. The above-described variance-weighted l east-
square ﬁt was then re-performed. The sample was generated as
a Latin-Hypercube sample using the lhs-function of MATLAB
and comprised 1,000 samples if not otherwise stated. The upper
and lower conﬁdence bounds were then derived as the α-th and
(1-α)-th percentile of the parameter sample obtained from 1000
least-squared ﬁts. If not otherwise stated α is set to 0.25, the
conﬁdence interval being the Interquartile Range (IQR).
The total CO 2 formation rate πCO2,tot(t) given in mol h −1 was
calculated from balancing the gas phase of the bioreactor as:

where )Phi1denotes the volume fraction of the gas species in
question in vol% and the superscripts α and ω denote the inlet

ﬂow in m 3 h−1. The biomass-speciﬁc carbon dioxide formation
rate πCO2 (t) given in mmol g −1

respectively, was obtained by dividing πCO2,tot(t) by X(t) at time

The complete set of extracellular rate estimates for all
independent bioreactor cultivation experiments can be found in
Supplementary Table 1.
Quantitative Metabolomics
The metabolome samples of all strains were spiked with identica l
internal standard and were measured in one acquisition batc h
on the LC-ESI-QqQ MS system. Organic acids and unstable
sugar phosphates were measured within 24 h from the extraction
of samples. Quenching, cell separation, cell extraction, isotope
dilution mass spectrometry and metabolite leakage correctio n
were performed according to previous protocols (
Paczia et al.,
2012; Tillack et al., 2012 ).
For quantiﬁcation of organic acids, samples were separated
using a synergy hydro C18 reversed phase column (Phenomenex)
on an Agilent 1200 chromatography system (Agilent
Technologies). The HPLC column outlet was coupled to
a QqQ MS device (API 4000, AB Sciex) equipped with a
TurboSpray ion source in negative ionization mode. The eluti on
was isocratic at 84% buﬀer A and 16% buﬀer B at a ﬂowrate
of 0.45 mL min −1 at 20 ◦C. The eluents were as follows: Buﬀer
A: 10 mM tributylamine, 15 mM acetic acid, pH 4.95; Buﬀer
B: methanol. MS parameters were as follows: CAD (collision
gas pressure): 5, CUR (curtain gas ﬂow): 30, GS1 (nebulizer
gas ﬂow): 70, GS2 (turbo heater gas ﬂow): 70, IS (electrospray
voltage): −4,500 V , TEM (heater gas temperature): 650 ◦C,
entrance potential: −10 eV. Injection volume was 10 µ L.
For quantiﬁcation of amino acids, samples were separated
using Luna SCX cation exchange column at 60 ◦C on a JASCO
HPLC system. The following buﬀers were employed: Buﬀer A:
5% acetic acid, B: 15 mM ammonium acetate. The applied elution
gradient can be found in Supplementary Table 2. Injection
volume was 10 µ L.
For quantiﬁcation of sugar and nucleoside phosphates,
samples were separated on a synergy hydro C18 reversed phase
column at 40 ◦C. Eluent were Buﬀer A: 10 mM tributylamine,
15 mM acetic acid, pH 4.95 and Buﬀer B: methanol. The HPLC
system, the QqQ MS device and its MS parameter settings
were the same as for the LC-MS/MS method for organic acids.
For quantiﬁcation the gradient of Supplementary Table 3 was
applied. Injection volume was 10 µ L.
Generation of Ion Libraries for Proteomics
To populate our C. glutamicum ion library, separate IDA
acquisitions of samples of C. glutamicum WT cultivated
as described above but with diﬀerent carbon sources were
performed. In each cultivation the carbon source was either
55 mM D-glucose, 111 mM sodium pyruvate, 83 mM disodium-
L-malate, 55 mM sodium citrate or 48 mM sodium benzoate.
Each sample was lysed and 100 µ g protein thereof digested and
processed as described elsewhere (
Voges and Noack, 2012 ).
These samples were separated on a Agilent 1260 Inﬁnity
HPLC system (Agilent Technologies) equipped with a 150 ∗
2.1 mm Ascentis Express Peptide ES-C18 column with 2.7 µ m
particle size and an appropriate 5 ∗ 0.3 mm Acclaim PepMap
Trap Cartridge (Thermo Scientiﬁc) which were both maintain ed
at 25 ◦C and a ﬂow rate of 200 µ L min −1. For LC separation
0.1% formic acid in LC-MS grade water (v v −1) was used as
buﬀer A, whereas buﬀer B was 0.1% formic acid in LC-MS
grade acetonitrile (v v −1). Before each injection, the column was
equilibrated for 12 min at 97% A. After 20 µ L were injected, the

Kappelmann et al. Analysis of C. glutamicum Anaplerotic Deletion Mutants
gradient of Supplementary Table 4 was applied. The LC-eluent
was coupled to an ESI-QqTOF MS (TripleTOF 6600, AB Sciex)
equipped with an DuoSpray ion source. The data acquisition was
performed using Analyst TF 1.8 (AB Sciex). An information-
dependent acquisition was performed on each injection during
which all ions with m/z >300, charge state 2–4 and above
intensity of 150 were selected for fragmentation.
The acquired MS2 spectra of the C. glutamicum digests
were searched against a FASTA database of C. glutamicum
ATCC 13032 (GenBank assembly accession: GCA_000196335.1)
using ProteinPilot software 5.0 (AB Sciex) employing defaul t
probabilities for biological modiﬁcations. The conﬁdently
identiﬁed peptides of each injection were assembled into a
library covering 1727 ORFs. This library incorporates the pepti de
conﬁdence after identiﬁcation, peptide (precursor) intensit y in
the MS1 scan from the IDA acquisition, fragment ion intensiti es
and the observed peptide retention time.
SWATH Acquisition
Starting from an IDA acquisition of each organism variable
SWATH windows were calculated using the SWATH Variable
Window Calculator 1.0 (AB Sciex). Using these windows, a
SWATH acquisition method was set up, which employed the
same chromatographic gradient and ion source setting as the I DA
acquisition. The window width and CE ramp parameters can
be found in Supplementary Table 5. For SWATH acquisition a
digest of each sample was prepared according to the protocol of
Voges and Noack, which involves mixing 50 µ g unlabeled sample
protein and 50 µ g internal standard from a separate cultivation
of C. glutamicum with ( 15NH4)2SO4 (
Voges and Noack, 2012 ).
Ten microliter of each sample was injected.
SWATH MS Data Processing
SWATH data processing was performed using the MS/MS all
SWATH Acquisition MicroApp in PeakView 2.2 (AB Sciex). The
ion library from above was imported from ProteinPilot into
this app by excluding shared peptides but not modiﬁed ones.
From the imported ion library the ten most intense peptides
were selected for quantiﬁcation provided they had a peptide
conﬁdence of >96%. The intensity selection is based on the MS1
survey scan intensity of each peptide in the IDA runs used to
build the ion library. If <10 peptides fulﬁlled the above criterion
for a protein, only the available peptides were quantiﬁed.
For each peptide group the 12 most intense fragment ion
traces were chosen by the SWATH processing algorithm. This
algorithm favors the most intense fragment ion traces from t he
library spectrum whose m/z value lies above the Q1 window
of their precursor ion. For each fragment ion, within 5 min
around the expected retention time, an unlabeled mass trace
was extracted from the SWATH spectra within ±15 ppm of
its monoisotopic mass, whereas the labeled mass trace was
extracted within ±15 ppm of its fully 15N-labeled isotopologue.
All transitions of one peptide were assembled into a so called
peak group which was scored for congruency with the ion librar y.
The false discovery rate was set to 0.1%. The ﬁnished processin g

Elemental Analysis of Biomass
The concentration of carbon, nitrogen and sulfur in biomass
were determined at the central Analytical core facility of
Forschungszentrum Jülich (ZEA-3). Biomass samples from the
early stationary phase were processed following the same
procedure as for CDW content determination. The dried biomas s
pellet was ground to a ﬁne powder in a pre-dried mortar using a
pre-dried pestle and sent in a sealed container to ZEA-3.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Growth Phenotyping of Anaplerotic
Deletions Mutants Under Deﬁned
D-Glucose Conditions
In our previous ﬂux identiﬁability analysis focusing on the
anaplerotic node in C. glutamicum those metabolic network
structures were identiﬁed that are structurally identiﬁab le under
deﬁned D-glucose conditions (
Kappelmann et al., 2016 ). These
structures are based on deletions of speciﬁc genes encoding fo r
anaplerotic reactions. In this study, we comprehensively analy zed
a set of mutant strains for which a unique solution using 13C-
MFA theoretically exists as well as mutants that are non-ﬂux-
identiﬁable strains.
All selected deletion mutants were able to grow on deﬁned
CGXII medium with D-glucose as sole carbon and energy
source, except for strain C. glutamicum )Delta1ppc )Delta1pyc that is
deﬁcient in PEPCx and PCx activity ( Table 1). While this
mutant was able to grow on acetate without lag-phase no
biomass formation could be monitored within 48 h cultivatio n
on D-glucose and this observation is concordant with
Peters-
Wendisch et al. (1998) . However, prolonged incubation of
C. glutamicum )Delta1ppc )Delta1pyc under deﬁned D-glucose conditions
in a microbioreactor setup and at diﬀerent inoculum sizes alw ays
resulted in the onset of growth after 75 h or later, mainly aft er
100 h ( Supplementary Figure 1 ).
The whole mutant library was then cultivated under
controlled bioreactor conditions on deﬁned CGXII medium
with 1% D-glucose. Speciﬁc growth and substrate uptake rates
were estimated using a model-based approach (see Materials
and Methods section). The D-glucose uptake rate of 4.82
mmol g −1
CDWh−1 and the speciﬁc growth rate of 0.45 h −1 for
C. glutamicum WT agree well with literature (
Buchholz et al.,
2014). Based on the determined conﬁdence intervals discernible
growth phenotypes can be identiﬁed among the set of deletion
mutants (Figure 2A and Table 2).
First, the C. glutamicum)Delta1pck mutant showed a lower growth
rate although PEPCk catalyzes a gluconeogenetic reaction, n ot
needed under glycolytic conditions to supply biomass precurso rs.
However, the observed growth defect clearly indicates its ac tivity
under glycolytic conditions. This result was also obtained i n the
study of Riedel et al. with the comparable genotype ( Table 2) and
in the study of
Petersen et al. (2001) , who inferred PEPCk activity
in a C. glutamicum L-lysine producer from 13C-labeling data.

uptake rates. Mean values of rate estimates are from biologi cal duplicate or
triplicate cultivations. Error estimates are given as the m inimum of the lower
bound and the maximum of the upper bound of each parameter ove r all
replicate cultivations of the mutant in question (see Supplementary Table 1 ).
(B) Carbon equivalents of the speciﬁc growth rate (blue), CO 2-formation rate
(gray) and the substrate uptake rate (orange). The error bar on the stacked
bars is the error on the sum of both rates, which was estimated according to
Gaussian error propagation.
Since the carbon ﬂow catalyzed by PEPCk is of opposite directio n
compared to the overall carbon ﬂow under glycolytic conditio ns,
its catalytic eﬀect must be of indirect nature. Strangely, the double
deletion mutant C. glutamicum)Delta1pck )Delta1malE showed a restored
growth phenotype, with a growth rate equivalent to the WT.
Deletion mutants comprising a deletion in PEPCx do not
show a signiﬁcantly altered growth phenotype as long as PCx
is still active ( Figure 2A and Table 2). The stoichiometry of
the reaction catalyzed by PEPCx is identical to the reaction
sequence of pyruvate kinase (PK) and PCx, which apparently
fully compensates for the missing carboxylation activity of
PEPCx. On the other hand, mutant strains C. glutamicum)Delta1pyc
and C. glutamicum)Delta1pyc )Delta1odx do exhibit a growth phenotype.
This ﬁnding underscores the role of PCx as most important
anaplerotic reaction under aerobic conditions and suggests that
its catalyzed ﬂux is most likely greater than that of PEPCx in
the WT under standard D-glucose conditions. Noteworthy, a
C. glutamicummutant with single deletion of the odx gene was
shown to grow equally well as the wild type (
Klaﬄ and Eikmanns,
2010).
The evolved C. glutamicum )Delta1ppc )Delta1pyc strain, missing both
carboxylation activities shows a greatly reduced growth rat e of
0.27 h−1 (Figure 2A and Table 2). In the absence of both PEPCx
and PCx, three other and diﬀerent anaplerotic activities can
possibly substitute the anaplerotic activity of PEPCx and PCx:
First, ME may catalyze the carboxylation of pyruvate to malate
in an NADPH-dependent manner. This appears plausible since
ME was found to catalyze this reaction sequence in in vitroassays
(
Cocaign-Bousquet et al., 1996; Gourdon et al., 2000 ). Moreover,
it could be experimentally shown that a NADPH-dependent ME
from E. colican act as sole anaplerotic enzyme in Saccharomyces
cerevisiae sustaining a growth rate of 0.06 h −1 (
Zelle et al.,
2011). Second, PEPCk may act in reverse direction from
phosphoenolpyruvate to oxaloacetate. This hypothesis is rathe r
unlikely as this reaction directionality would couple anapler otic
carboxylation to the substrate level phosphorylation, generat ing
one GTP molecule. Since the reaction from oxaloacetate to
phosphoenolpyruvate is coupled to the hydrolysis of one GTP
molecule, it can be expected to be favored. A third alternativ e
represents the glyoxylate shunt, which exclusively fulﬁlls th e
anaplerotic function in C. glutamicumunder growth on acetate
(
Wendisch et al., 1997 ).
A Closer Look Into Carbon Balancing
Interestingly, the C. glutamicum)Delta1ppc )Delta1pyc mutant also showed
an altered ratio of speciﬁc glucose uptake and growth rate
in comparison to other mutants and the WT ( Figure 2A).
The observation that less biomass was formed per unit uptake
rate raised the question as to where the excess carbon atoms
end up. To answer this question, a carbon balance was
performed. Contrary to the conventional carbon balancing
approach, consisting in the quantiﬁcation of the total carbon
recovery in biomass and exhaust gas by the time all substrate
has been consumed (
Buchholz et al., 2014 ), we calculated the
instantaneous carbon balance )Theta1as:

Comparison of own data with available literature data for cultivation ex periments with the speciﬁed strains on deﬁned CGXII media and D-glucose as sole carbon and energy source.
Data from C. glutamicum ATCC 13032 (WT) was only included from studi es with corresponding deletion mutants. In case no quantitative data was avail able a qualitative comparison
was made.
aAeration was limited to 0.1 vvm and the media contained no initial protocate chuic acid.
bEvolved strain after prolonged cultivation in CGXII media with D-glucose as sole carbon and energy source.
CO2 formation are the only considered carbon sinks (any other
by-product formation could be excluded for all strains under
investigation). The quantity ωC has been reported several times
in the literature:
Marx et al. (1996) reported 0.408 g C g−1
CDW
for C. glutamicum MH20-22B, a L-lysine producer strain,
determined in freeze-dried biomass with a CHNS elemental
analyzer. More recently,
Buchholz et al. (2014) reported a
value of 0.514 g C g−1
CDW for C. glutamicumATCC 13032, which
was determined by separately quantifying the total carbon
in liquid bioreactor samples (supernatant and biomass) and
the total inorganic carbon (total dissolved carbon) in the
supernatant. In this work, we experimentally quantiﬁed ωC
for wild-type C. glutamicum to be around 0.4–0.42 g C g−1
CDW.
The uncertainty of this parameter notwithstanding, its valu e
was assumed to be 0.45 g C g−1
CDW for all following calculations.
In face of the apparent uncertainty, its standard error was
assumed to be 0.05 g C g−1
CDW. The arising interval covers all
available literature information on this quantity. The unc ertainty
in derived quantities thereof can be computed by Gaussian
error propagation.
From Figure 2B it becomes apparent that the evolved
)Delta1ppc )Delta1pyc strain grows with a higher relative CO 2-formation
rate with respect to the uptake rate. At the same time,
the sum of the speciﬁc rates at which carbon ﬂows into
sinks amounts to the same relative value with respect to
the carbon uptake rate as in other strains. Therefore, it
seems plausible that a higher decarboxylation activity expla ins
the lower relative growth rate in the C. glutamicum )Delta1ppc
)Delta1pyc mutant. This higher relative CO 2-formation rate further
substantiates the hypothesis that an altered ratio of ICL
and ICD activity involves the glyoxylate shunt as anaplerotic
reaction sequence in this mutant. Exclusive anaplerotic acti vity
through the glyoxylate shunt would release two equivalents
CO2 per C4-body of oxaloacetate formed, instead of ﬁxing
one CO 2 as in the case of alternative ME or reversible
PEPCk activities.

Kappelmann et al. Analysis of C. glutamicum Anaplerotic Deletion Mutants
One result holds true irrespective of the genetic background :
The recovery of carbon at any given time in the reactions that
act as carbon sinks amounts to 80% of the carbon equivalent
of the uptake rate ( Figure 2B and Table 2). The non-closed
instantaneous carbon balance may hint to extensive by-produ ct
formation or indicate systematically biased extracellular rates.
The former is unlikely since C. glutamicum WT is known
to produce only minor by-products under aerobic conditions
(the DO was maintained at 30%). Notwithstanding, the genetic
alterations may induce a more extensive overﬂow metabolism
in some deletion mutants. However, all organic acids, sugar
phosphates and amino acids in the culture supernatant measured
by targeted LC-MS/MS account for a total of 274–786 µ molC
g−1
CDW, depending on the strain. Therefore, the exometabolome
can be neglected as carbon sink since the gap in the balance of
speciﬁc rates amounts to several mmol C g−1
CDW h−1 (Figure 2B).
Remarkably, the value of 80% for the instantaneous carbon
balance matches the determined carbon balance closure in th e
study of
Buchholz et al. (2014) . This study convincingly showed
that the gap in carbon balance can be traced back to the fact
that part of the CO 2-production at any given time dissolves
as HCO −
3 in the culture broth. This share is not recovered as
gaseous CO2 at the detector, leading to an underestimation of the
CO2-production rate.
Proteomic and Metabolomic Responses to
Gene Deletions in Anaplerotic Reactions
To gain further insight into the metabolism of each mutant,
untargeted proteome and targeted metabolome analyses were
performed. To ensure comparability, eight strains were culti vated
in parallel and subjected to identical and isochronous sample
processing in subsequent steps (see section Materials and
Methods for detailed descriptions). In total, we analyzed 1199
cytosolic proteins and 48 metabolites of central metabolism .
Since the )Delta1ppc mutant showed no altered phenotype and has
been thoroughly characterized before, it was omitted from t he
set of strains to be analyzed. The evolved strain C. glutamicum
)Delta1ppc )Delta1pyc showed signiﬁcant changes in speciﬁc proteins
and metabolites, which will be discussed separately in the
next section.
Further diﬀerentially expressed proteins were found in
C. glutamicum)Delta1pck and C. glutamicum)Delta1pyc (Figure 3). In none
of the other tested deletion mutants signiﬁcantly changed pr otein
abundances [ p< 0.05, |Log2(fold change)| ≥ 0.5] were found
(data not shown).
Only one protein encoded by cybD (cg0282) and which might
be involved in stress response was found to be up-regulated in
the C. glutamicum )Delta1pck mutant ( Table 3). In C. glutamicum
)Delta1pyc the enzyme quinolinate synthase A encoded by the
nadA gene (cg1216) was up-regulated. This enzyme catalyzes
the condensation of iminoaspartate with dihydroxyacetone
phosphate to form quinolinate, and represents the second step
of the de novo synthesis of NAD +. The latter starts from L-
aspartate and up-regulation of this enzyme could be a cellular
response to the limited availability of this amino acid follow ing
the inactivation of PCx and to ensure suﬃcient NAD + supply. In
addition, the putative transcriptional regulator (cg0787) a nd the
50S ribosomal protein L36 encoded by the rpmJ gene (cg2791)
were found to be down-regulated in C. glutamicum)Delta1pyc.
Figure 4 shows intracellular and extracellular concentrations
of selected metabolites. The L-aspartate pool is most closely
correlated with the growth rate, i.e., the lowest concentra tions
were observed for all mutants with reduced growth rate.
Apparently, its supply appears to be limiting the growth as the
restored growth rate of the )Delta1pck )Delta1malE mutant in comparison
to the single deletion strain )Delta1pck goes hand in hand with
increased L-aspartate supply. The concentration pattern of L-
aspartate seems to reﬂect itself in the L-homoserine pool,
which is derived from the former through three intermediate
reaction steps, consuming two NAD(P)H molecules and one
ATP molecule. In contradistinction to L-aspartate, however, L-
homoserine is clearly higher concentrated in the )Delta1pck mutant.
Since the reaction sequence between both intermediates is r edox-
dependent, one may be tempted to attribute this observation
to redox balancing. The biosynthesis of L-glutamate from
α -ketoglutarate and of L-proline from L-glutamate are also
redox-dependent. Conspicuously, both pools are also higher
concentrated in this strain ( Figure 4).
Moreover, we analyzed intracellular levels of NADPH and
NADH alongside their oxidized analogs. No signiﬁcant diﬀere nce
was detected in the reduced forms of these co-factors (data n ot
shown). However, the mean of relative standard deviation ov er
all mutants for NADH and NADPH concentrations amounts to
46% and 48%, respectively. This high technical error, impeding
a precise quantiﬁcation, cannot be traced back to inaccuraci es in
pipetting or BV concentration measurements since these facto rs
also apply to all other metabolite quantiﬁcations in the same
sample. Since the mean relative standard deviation for other
metabolite pools was below 10% these factors appear to have been
controlled quite well. The most likely reason for the observe d
coeﬃcients of variation is metabolite instability. The redo x
equivalents are known to be quite sensitive to oxidation and
degradation (
Siegel et al., 2014 ). Slightly diﬀerent temperature
time courses, residual enzymatic activity in metabolite ext racts
and oxidation most likely account for the observed diﬀerence s.
Therefore, no accurate conclusion about the redox state in e ach
mutant could be drawn. Nonetheless, the fact that the remova l
of a redox-dependent enzyme like ME restores the growth rate
of the C. glutamicum )Delta1pck mutant suggests an involvement of
the redox balance mediating some of the observed changes in
metabolite pools.
Glyoxylate Shunt Enables Growth of

Two insertions and some SNPs (see Supplementary Table 6)
were detected in the coding region for ICD. Moreover, ICL
(cg2560), MS (cg2559), and cis-aconitase (ACN, cg1737) are
highly up-regulated in C. glutamicum)Delta1ppc )Delta1pyc (Figure 3 and

Table 3) and only in this mutant intracellular and extracellular
accumulation of glyoxylate was detected ( Figure 4).
These ﬁndings are in agreement with the study of Schwentner
et al. and point to a redirection of carbon ﬂux in our evolved
strain from the oxidative decarboxylation branch of the TCA
cycle into the glyoxylate shunt (
Schwentner et al., 2018 ). In the
absence of C3-carboxylation activity at the anaplerotic nod e,
accumulation of the substrate pools phosphoenolpyruvate and
pyruvate can be expected. Indeed, phosphoenolpyruvate was
signiﬁcantly higher concentrated in the evolved )Delta1ppc )Delta1pyc
strain, while the intracellular pyruvate pool remained unaﬀect ed
(Figure 4). However, metabolite levels of L-alanine and L-
valine, which are directly derived from pyruvate, were stron gly
increased and this ﬁnding is also consistent with previous data
(
Schwentner et al., 2018 ). The lack of statistical signiﬁcance of
strain diﬀerences in the pyruvate pool is most likely due to
higher technical errors during metabolite quantiﬁcation. I t is
well-established that the accurate quantiﬁcation of organ ic acids
in cell extracts represents a veritable challenge (
Zimmermann
et al., 2014 ).

Moreover, the metabolite pool of L-glycine shows one of the
most signiﬁcant concentration changes, clearly distinguis hing the
evolved )Delta1ppc )Delta1pyc strain. L-glycine, in turn, is derived from L-
serine, which also showed an increased concentration ( Figure 4).
It appears that the missing carboxylation rate cannot be match ed
by the pyruvate dehydrogenase activity in the )Delta1ppc )Delta1pyc mutant
for substrate pools like phosphoenolpyruvate as well as amino
acids derived from the lower glycolytic intermediates appear
to accumulate intracellularly. This would also explain why
the phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase encoded by serA (cg1451)
was found to be signiﬁcantly down-regulated in this mutant
(Table 3). The enzyme catalyzes the ﬁrst step in the biosynthesis
of L-glycine, L-serine and L-cysteine and its down-regulation
could be the cellular response to the higher availability of 3 -
phosphoglycerate.
In terms of glyoxylate shunt regulation, Wendisch et al.
suggested that the carbon-source dependent regulation of th is
pathway is mediated by intracellular acetyl-CoA concentrati ons
(
Wendisch et al., 1997 ). However, intracellular acetyl-CoA
concentrations did not vary signiﬁcantly with respect to str ain
background ( Figure 4), and therefore this hypothesis could
not be validated with the made intracellular measurements.
Unfortunately, acetyl-CoA measurements are notoriously er ror-
prone due to the high instability of thioesthers. Though taki ng
strenuous eﬀorts to keep the sample below −20◦C and immediate
analysis after extraction, we still obtained a highly varia ble signal
within each treatment group.
The corresponding genes aceA and aceB of ICL and MS,
respectively, are thought to be repressed by the regulator prot ein
RamB (cg0444) under glycolytic conditions (
Auchter et al., 2011 ).
Moreover, it has been established that RamA (cg2831) acts as
transcriptional activator of both genes when acetate is the c arbon
source. However, no signiﬁcant change in the abundances of
RamA and RamB were found in )Delta1ppc )Delta1pyc mutant compared
to the wild type. The fact that a )Delta1ramA mutant is not able
to grow on acetate suggests that RamA is strictly required as
transcriptional activator for increased expression of at lea st one
of the essential enzymes of acetate assimilation, which are acetate
kinase (AK) encoded by ackA (cg3047), phosphotransacetylase
(PTA) encoded by pta (cg3048), ICL and MS (
Cramer and
Eikmanns, 2007 ). Indeed, AK and PTA are also signiﬁcantly
up-regulated in the )Delta1ppc )Delta1pyc mutant (Table 3).
Most interestingly, this strain also shows an up-regulation of
the three enzymes of the methylcitrate cycle in C. glutamicum
(Claes et al., 2002 ), namely 2-methylcitrate synthase (PrpC2)
encoded by prpC2 (cg0762), 2-methylcitrate dehydratase
(PrpD2) encoded by prpD2 (cg0759) and 2-methylcitrate lyase
(PrpB2) encoded by prpB2 (cg0760) ( Table 3). Together with
the activities of AK and PTA this cycle is known to be the
predominant route for the degradation of propionate into
pyruvate and succinate ( Figure 1). In the presence of propionate
all three genes are transcriptionally activated by the regul ator
PrpR (
Plassmeier et al., 2012 ). Under the applied D-glucose
conditions, however, no change in the PrpR abundance was
detected. Moreover, it was found that the prpDBC2 operon
is transcriptionally activated by RamA, but not aﬀected by
RamB (
Auchter et al., 2011 ). This makes the conclusion
compelling that the concentration of at least one, still unkno wn,
metabolite eﬀector binding to RamA was altered, leading to th e
activation of the aforementioned genes. Following the stron g
up-regulation of the prpDBC2 cluster in combination with
the glyoxylate shunt it might be speculated that the surplus of
pyruvate (from PEPCx and PCx inactivation) and succinate
(from ICL activity) is channeled into the methylcitrate cycl e,

operating in the reverse direction. This route would represen t
a by-pass of the TCA cycle reactions succinate: quinone
oxidoreductase (SQO), fumarase (FUM) and malate: quinone
oxidoreductase (MQO) to provide oxaloacetate as biomass
precursor ( Figure 1). From a thermodynamic point of view,
the PrpB2 reaction in direction of 2-methylisocitrate is fav ored
()Delta1rG
′0 = − 9.3 kJ/mol) in comparison to the SQO reaction
leading to fumarate ( )Delta1rG
′0 = 14.5 kJ/mol). However, the
potentially last step of the methylcitrate cycle catalyzed b y PrpC2
is thermodynamically very unfavorable ( )Delta1rG
′0 = 39.2 kJ/mol),
but might still work under in vivo conditions due to very low
concentrations of oxaloacetate ( <100 nM of lower detection
limit of applied LC-QqQ MS). Indeed, Plassmeier et al. showed
that the prpDBC2 operon is also expressed under normal cell
growth conditions in wild-type C. glutamicum, independent
of the application of propionate as carbon source (
Plassmeier
et al., 2007 ). Moreover, a high up-regulation of the prpDBC2
operon was found in a C. glutamicum strain engineered for
overproduction of L-isoleucine ( Ma et al., 2018 ). Here it was
speculated that this up-regulation was due to a high intracell ular
formation of propionyl-CoA, which was derived from the
intermediate 2-ketobutyrate of the L-isoleucine biosynthesis.
The resulting propionyl-CoA was then further converted into
a polyhydroxyalkanoate by heterologous expression of the
phaCAB gene cluster. In our case, however, we can exclude
propionyl-CoA formation from 2-ketobutyrate because L-
aspartate is limiting. Additionally, it remains open what happen s
with propionyl-CoA as the second product of the PrpC2 reaction
when running in reverse direction ( Figure 1). Therefore, further
investigations on the interplay between the diﬀerent pathways
are required to substantiate our hypothesis.
Moreover, we found a SNP in the intergenic region between
cg3314 and cg3315, four nucleotides upstream from the
translation start of MalR ( malR, cg3315). This protein has been
originally identiﬁed as repressor of the malE gene in the study of
Krause et al. (2012) and was recently reported to bind to several
other loci ( Hünnefeld et al., 2019 ). Since the mutation occurred
outside the coding sequence of this regulator, only expressi on
changes of the gene are able to aﬀect metabolism. Unfortunately,
the speciﬁc protein data for MalR was not very accurate ( p > 0.5)
to enable any conclusion, but ME appeared to be down-regulated

as sole carbon and energy source (0.54-fold, p < 4.73e-10).
Since puriﬁed ME of C. glutamicum was shown to carboxylate
pyruvate in in vitro assays with an apparent Km constant of
13.8 mM (
Gourdon et al., 2000 ) it was speculated that ME serves
as anaplerotic enzyme under circumstances when PEPCx and
PCx activities are absent and pyruvate availability is still ensured
through running glycolysis. In our case, however, the amoun t of
ME was signiﬁcantly reduced with respect to the wild type and its
intracellular substrate pool of pyruvate is not signiﬁcantly altered
and well below the Km value ( Figure 4A). Therefore, it can be
excluded that ME catalyzes a ﬂux compensating for the missing
PCx and PEPCx activity in the evolved )Delta1ppc )Delta1pyc strain.
Finally, a deletion was detected in the mctC gene (cg0953),
which has been shown to be essential in C. glutamicum for the
uptake of pyruvate (
Jolkver et al., 2009 ). Based on this, it can
be hypothesized that the genetic alteration in this transport er
may lead to a decreased uptake of pyruvate from the medium,
which would explain the extracellular accumulation of pyruva te
exclusively found in the )Delta1ppc )Delta1pyc mutant (Figure 4B).
CONCLUSIONS
We characterized eight diﬀerent mutant strains of C. glutamicum
carrying single or double deletions in ﬁve anaplerotic enzym es.
The metabolism and adaptation of each mutant during growth
under deﬁned D-glucose conditions in lab-scale bioreactors was
investigated by quantiﬁcation of its extracellular rates, c entral
metabolic intermediates by LC-QqQ MS and proteome by
SWATH acquisition using a LC-QqTOF MS platform.
In comparison to the wild type the four deletion mutants
C. glutamiucm)Delta1pyc, C. glutamiucm)Delta1pyc )Delta1odx, C. glutamiucm
)Delta1ppc )Delta1pyc, and C. glutamiucm )Delta1pck showed lowered speciﬁc
growth rates and D-glucose uptake rates, underlining the
importance of PCx and PEPCk activity for a balanced carbon and
energy ﬂux at the anaplerotic node.
Detailed analyses of the C. glutamicum )Delta1ppc )Delta1pyc mutant
evolved to grow on D-glucose revealed the strong up-regulation
of a few genes that are under control of the transcriptional
regulator RamA. Higher protein abundances were found for the
enzymes of the glyxoylate shunt as well as the methylcitrate cy cle
under solely glycolytic conditions, under which condition t he
corresponding genes were thought to be repressed. It is inferr ed
that this adaptation must be due to a changed concentration of
a metabolite aﬀecting the activity of regulator protein RamA,
brought about by a concentration change of the former. This
metabolite pool, however, could not be identiﬁed from the set
of metabolites from glycolysis, TCA cycle and amino acids
that was targeted in this study. Since the encoding genes
of the altered proteins represent just a small subset of the
RamA regulon, it can be concluded that the binding aﬃnities

of RamA to all target genes may be regulated by various
eﬀector metabolites and not a single one. Further research,
especially based on untargeted metabolomics, will be needed
to identify the metabolite regulator(s) active on RamA unde r
D-glucose conditions.
In conjunction with the intracellular metabolomics
data we generally conclude that C. glutamicum is able to
compensate missing carboxylation activities of PEPCx and
PCx by activation of the glyoxylate shunt, potentially in
combination with the methylcitrate cycle to channel the hig her
levels of PEP/ pyruvate as well as succinate and thereby also
contributing to replenish oxaloacetate. To further substan tiate
the hypothesis on the reverse operation of the methylcitrate
cycle isotope-based metabolic ﬂux analyses with the evolved
C. glutamicum )Delta1ppc )Delta1pyc strain could be conducted in
further studies.
Finally, the reproducible eﬀect of bicarbonate formation
under excess D-glucose conditions and its consequences for
carbon balancing also requires further investigations. Fo r
example, a combination of batch experiments under variation o f
pH and gassing rate as well as thorough modeling of the resultin g
CO2-dynamics in the gas and liquid phase could be an approach
for a more accurate determination of CO 2-formation rates.
