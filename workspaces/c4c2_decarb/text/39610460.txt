Abstract
Background: Progress in improving risk stratification methods for patients with 
cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukaemia (CN-AML) remains limited. This study 
investigates the prognostic significance and potential functional mechanism of malic enzyme 1 
(ME1) in CN-AML.
Methods: Gene expression and clinical data of patients with CN-AML were obtained from 
the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets, which were 
subjected to analysis. The prognostic significance of ME1 was assessed through Kaplan–Meier 
survival analysis, as well as univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. A novel risk 
model based on ME1 expression levels was developed using TCGA data for predicting CN-
AML prognosis. Furthermore, the impact of ME1 silencing on AML cell lines was investigated 
using the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and flow cytometry. Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) 
analysis and Western blotting were performed to explore the mechanism of ME1 in CN-AML.
Results: CN-AML patients expressing higher ME1 levels exhibited shorter event-free survival 
(EFS) and overall survival (OS) compared to those with lower ME1 expression in the TCGA 
and multiple GEO datasets (all p < 0.05). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses 
indicated that ME1 expression served as an independent prognostic factor for the EFS 
(p = 0.024 in TCGA, p = 0.035 in GSE6891) and OS (p = 0.039 in TCGA, p = 0.008 in GSE6891) in 
patients with CN-AML. The developed risk model demonstrated that patients with CN-AML 
in the high-risk group had worse survival than those in the low-risk group (hazard ratio: 2.67, 
95% confidence interval: 1.54–4.65, p < 0.001) and exhibited strong predictive accuracy for 
1-, 3- and 5-year OS (area under the curve = 0.69, 0.75, 0.79, respectively). ME1 knockdown 
significantly inhibited proliferation and increased apoptosis in AML cells (all p < 0.05). GSEA 
and Western blotting demonstrated that ME1 regulates the IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 pathway in CN-
AML.
Conclusion: Elevated ME1 expression serves as an indicator of poorer prognosis in patients 
with CN-AML, potentially facilitating leukaemogenesis through the IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 pathway. 
This suggests that ME1 could be a promising prognostic biomarker and therapeutic target for 
CN-AML.

Plain language summary 
High levels of malic enzyme 1 (ME1) predict worse outcomes in normal chromosome 
acute myeloid leukemia and drive cancer growth via a key pathway
Background: Normal chromosome acute myeloid leukaemia (CN-AML) is a type of blood 
cancer where current methods to predict patient outcomes are not very effective. This 
study looks at the role of a protein called malic enzyme 1 (ME1) in predicting patient 
outcomes and how it might contribute to cancer progression.
Methods: We used data from large cancer databases to analyze the gene expression and 
clinical outcomes of CN-AML patients. We evaluated the importance of ME1 levels for 
predicting survival using statistical methods. Additionally, we created a new risk model 
based on ME1 expression to forecast patient outcomes. We also studied how reducing ME1 
levels affects cancer cells in the lab, and explored the pathways ME1 might influence using 
gene analysis and protein tests.
Results: Patients with higher ME1 levels had shorter times without cancer events and 
overall survival compared to those with lower levels. Statistical analysis showed that ME1 
is an independent factor for poor prognosis. Our risk model revealed that patients in the 
high-risk group had worse survival rates. Reducing ME1 in cancer cells decreased their 
growth and increased cell death. Further analysis indicated that ME1 influences a key 
pathway involved in cancer development.
Conclusion: High ME1 levels are linked to worse outcomes in CN-AML patients and may 
promote cancer growth through a specific pathway. ME1 could be a useful marker for 
prognosis and a potential target for treatment in CN-AML.

Introduction
Patients with acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) 
exhibit heterogeneity and are categorised into 
favourable-, intermediate- and adverse-risk 
groups based on cytogenetical and molecular 
abnormalities.
1 Cytogenetically normal AML 
(CN-AML) constitutes nearly half of all AML 
cases, and their prognosis varies significantly. 
Previously identified genes with dysregulated 
expression, such as PDE7B, STAB1, NCALD, 
ACTL10, HSPA8 and CPT1B, have been linked 
to the prognosis of CN-AML.
2–7 The exploration 
of novel molecular biomarkers holds potential 
benefits for advancing risk stratification and ther-
apeutic interventions for these patients.
Malic enzyme 1 (ME1) encodes a cytosolic pro-
tein with nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 
phosphate-dependent enzyme activity and 
participates in various biological processes.
8 
Recently, ME1 has been implicated in the pro-
gression of various cancer types, including 
breast cancer and gastric cancer.
9–11 Additionally, 
it has been associated with mediating chemo-
therapy resistance in AML,
12 and high ME1 
expression has been identified as a molecular 
predictor of post-transplant survival in  
patients with AML.
13 However, the precise role 
of ME1 in CN-AML remains incompletely 
elucidated.
This study delves into the prognostic significance 
of ME1 in CN-AML patients using multiple pub-
lic datasets. Furthermore, the potential functional 
mechanism of ME1 was explored, providing evi-
dence supporting its role as a prognostic bio-
marker and therapeutic target in patients with 
CN-AML.

Methods
Expression data and clinical information of 
patients with CN-AML
Data were retrieved from 79 patients with 
CN-AML, encompassing gene expression and 
complete clinical information, from the Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TGCA; https://portal.gdc.cancer.
gov/) for analysis. Three CN-AML microarray 
datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus 
(GEO) database were acquired and examined: 
GSE6891 (n  = 187), GSE71014 (n  = 104), 
GSE12417 (n = 162). Expression and clinical data 
were downloaded from the GEO database (http://
www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), and the survival 
data for GSE6891 were provided by Prof. Peter J. 
M. Valk. Additionally, BeatAML2.0 dataset
14 
(http://vizome.org/aml2/) was screened and ana-
lysed as the validation cohort for the risk model.
Clinical characteristics and survival analysis
Patients with CN-AML within the TCGA and 
GEO datasets were divided into low- and high 
ME1 expression groups based on the median ME1 
expression. Specifically, 79 and 187 patients with 
CN-AML from TCGA and GSE6891, respec-
tively, were included in the analysis to investigate 
the association between the ME1 expression and 
various clinicopathological factors, such as French-
American-British (FAB) subtypes and gene muta-
tion. Univariate and multivariate analyses were 
conducted on event-free survival (EFS) and overall 
survival (OS) in both CN-AML cohorts to deter-
mine the independent prognostic significance for 
survival. EFS was defined as the time from diagno-
sis to the first event, encompassing death (any 
cause), disease progression, relapse and the last 
follow-up. OS was defined as the time from diagno-
sis to death (any cause) or the last follow-up.
Construction of a risk model for the OS of 
patients with CN-AML
After multivariate Cox regression analysis was 
performed to investigate independent prognostic 
factors for the OS in patients with CN-AML 
within the TCGA database, age, the DNMT3A 
mutation status and ME1 expression were incor-
porated into the development of a prognostically 
relevant risk model. Subsequently, a nomogram 
for OS prediction, integrating these factors, was 
constructed using the ‘rms’ R package developed 
by Frank E. Harrell Jr.
Cells culture, antibodies and reagents
THP-1, NB4, Kasumi-1, HL-60 and MOLM-13 
cell lines were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium, 
while MV4-11 cells were maintained in IMDM 
medium. All media were supplemented with 10% 
foetal bovine serum (FBS) and 1% penicillin/
streptomycin. The cells were incubated in 5% 
CO
2 at 37°C.
The antibodies used in this study included 
mouse anti-PARP/Cleaved PARP (Proteintech, 
Chicago, USA, 66520), rabbit anti-caspase 3 
p17/p19 (Proteintech, Chicago, USA, 19677), 
mouse anti-ME1 (Proteintech, Chicago, USA, 
68117), rabbit anti-IL6 (Affinity Biosciences,  
Changzhou, China, 6087), rabbit anti-JAK2 
(Affinity Biosciences, Changzhou, China, 
AF6022), rabbit anti-p-JAK2 (Tyr1007, 
Affinity Biosciences, Changzhou, China, 
AF3002), rabbit anti-STAT3 (Affinity 
Biosciences, Changzhou, China, AF6294), rab-
bit anti-p-STAT3 (Ser727, Changzhou, China, 
Affinity Biosciences, AF3294) and mouse anti-
β-actin (Proteintech, Chicago, USA, 20526).
Knocking down and overexpressing ME1 gene
Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) targeting ME1, 
along with a negative control (si-NC) were syn-
thesized and purchased from GenePharma 
(Shanghai, China), while plasmids for overex-
pressing ME1 (OE) and the negative control 
(NC) were obtained from WZ Bioscience 
(Shandong, China). The transfection reagent 
Lipofectamine™ RNAiMAX (Thermo, Waltham, 
USA, 13778150) and Lipofectamine™ 3000 
(Thermo, Waltham, USA, L3000001) were used 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions to 
knocking down or overexpressing ME1, respec-
tively. The efficacy of knockdown or overexpres-
sion for ME1 gene was assessed after cells with 
transfection for 48 h.
Cell Counting Kit-8 assay and cell apoptosis 
analysis
After cells were incubated in a medium contain-
ing 10% FBS for 24, 48 and 72 h, 10 μl of Cell 
Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) reagent (EnoGene, 
Nanjing, China, E1CK-000208) was added to 
each well and incubated for an additional 4 h. 
The optical density value was then measured at 
450 nm absorbance using a Spectromax reader 
(BIOTEK 800TS, Winooski, USA).

TherapeuTic advances in 
hematology
After 48 h of transfection, cells were collected at 
2000 rpm, washed once with PBS and stained 
with Annexin V-PE and 7-AAD solution (Vazyme, 
Nanjing, China, A213) at room temperature for 
10 min, avoiding exposure to light. The percent-
age of apoptotic cells was assessed using the BD 
Accuri C6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San 
Jose, CA, USA).
Real-time quantitative polymerase chain 
reaction assay
Total RNA was isolated from AML cell lines, and 
cDNA synthesis was performed according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions (Thermo, K1622). 
Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-qPCR) was performed using Bimake™ 
2 × SYBR Green qPCR Master Mix (Bimake, 
B21203). The RT-qPCR primers used in this 
study were as follows: ME1 forward primers: 
GGGAGACCTTGGCTGTAATGG, ME1 
reverse primers: TTCGGTTCCCACATCC 
AGAAT; GAPDH forward primers: AATGAA 
GGGGTCATTGATGG; GAPDH reverse prim-
ers: AAGGTGAAGGTCGGAGTCAA. The 
RT-qPCR experiments were performed with trip-
licates, and the relative ME1 expression was 
determined using the 2
−ΔΔct method.
Western blotting
Cells were collected and lysed on ice for 30 min 
with RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime, Shanghai, 
China, P0013B) supplemented with protease 
inhibitors (CWBIO, Beijing, China, CW2200). 
Phosphorylated proteins were detected with the 
addition of phosphorylase inhibitors (CWBIO, 
Beijing, China, CW383). The protein concen-
tration was determined using the BCA protein 
quantification assay (Beyotime, Shanghai, 
China, P0012). Subsequently, 40 μg of protein 
were separated into the SDS-PAGE gels and 
transferred onto the PVDF membrane, which 
were then blocked with 5% non-fat milk. The 
membranes were incubated with the corre-
sponding primary and secondary antibodies. 
Protein expression was examined using the 
chemiluminescence method with the Super 
ECL Plus kit (Abbkine, Wuhan, China, 
BMU102), and images were captured using the 
image analysis system (VILBER FUSION-
SOLO.6S, Marne-la-Vallée, France).
Gene set enrichment analysis
Functional enrichment analysis comparing the low- 
and high ME1 expression groups was conducted 
using the GSEA 4.2.2 software (Broad Institute of 
MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 
USA). Significance in enrichment was established 
with a normal p  value (NOR) < 0.05 and a false 
discovery rate (FDR) q value of <2.5.
Statistics
The R software (v4.1.3) (R Core Team, Vienna, 
Austria) was employed to establish a risk model, 
while statistical analysis was performed using 
SPSS 24.0 software (IBM Corporation, Armonk, 
New York, USA). For comparing clinicopatho-
logical factors between groups, nonparametric 
tests or chi-square tests were applied based on the 
data types. Survival analysis for OS and EFS used 
Kaplan–Meier and univariate and multivariate 
Cox analyses. Statistical significance was set at 
p < 0.05.
Results
Clinicopathological characteristics of patients 
with CN-AML in the TCGA and GEO datasets
The 79 patients with CN-AML from the TCGA 
database were divided into two groups based on 
ME1 expression levels, and various clinicopatho-
logical characteristics were analysed. In parallel, 
we conducted similar analyses for 187 CN-AML 
patients from the GSE6891 dataset. In TCGA 
database, parameters such as sex, age, race, white 
blood cell count, bone marrow blasts, FAB sub-
type and several recurrent gene mutations in 
AML did not show significant differences between 
the two groups (Supplemental Table S1). 
Meanwhile, in GSE6891 dataset, patients in the 
high ME1 group exhibited a higher prevalence of 
FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 internal tandem dupli-
cation (FLT3-ITD) gene mutation and a lower 
incidence of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein 
alpha (CEBPα) gene with double mutation 
(Supplemental Table S2). We summarized the 
significant clinical characteristics derived from 
the TCGA database and the GSE6891 dataset in 
Table 1. In the TCGA cohort, a higher propor-
tion of patients with EFS exceeding 2 and 3 years, 
as well as OS exceeding 2 and 3 years, were 
observed in the low ME1 expression group. 
C Zhang, W Li et al.

Similarly, in the GSE6891 dataset, patients with 
EFS and OS greater than 1, 2 and 3 years were 
more prevalent in the low ME1 expression group. 
Kaplan–Meier survival analyses were conducted 
based on ME1 expression levels in these datasets. 
Patients in the TCGA cohort with low ME1 
expression demonstrated significantly improved 
EFS (Figure 1(a)) and OS (Figure 1(c)), with 
similar trends observed in the GSE6891 dataset 
(Figure 1(b) and (d)). Additionally, CN-AML 
patients with high ME1 expression in the 
GSE71014 and GSE12417 datasets also exhib-
ited a shorter OS (Figure 1(e) and (f)). In sum-
mary, the above results suggest an association 
between ME1 expression and the prognosis of 
patients with CN-AML.
ME1 is an independent predictor for the EFS 
and OS in patients with CN-AML
To assess the effect of various factors on EFS and 
OS in patients with CN-AML, univariate Cox 
regression analysis was performed based on the 
clinicopathological factors and ME1 expression 
data from the TCGA database (Supplemental 
Table S3). In the TCGA database, patients with 
high ME1 expression (hazard ratio (HR): 2.390, 
95% confidence interval (CI): 1.329–4.295, 
p = 0.004), DNMT3A mutation (HR: 2.186, 95% 
CI: 1.216–3.929, p = 0.009) and FLT3-ITD muta-
tion (HR: 2.040, 95% CI: 1.119–3.721, p = 0.020) 
exhibited worse EFS. Meanwhile, patients aged 
⩾60 years (HR: 1.989, 95% CI: 1.143–3.462, 
p = 0.015) and those with high ME1 expression 
(HR: 1.972, 95% CI: 1.143–3.401, p  = 0.015) 
exhibited notably poorer OS. Subsequently, mul-
tivariate Cox regression analysis was conducted in 
the TCGA database, including age, the DNMT3A 
mutation status and ME1 expression (Table 2). 
The results indicated that CN-AML patients with 
DNMT3A mutation and high ME1 expression 
had a significantly worse EFS (HR: 2.509, 95% 
CI: 1.280–4.919, p = 0.007; HR: 2.010, 95% CI: 
1.095–3.691, p = 0.024). Moreover, patients aged

⩾60 years, those with DNMT3A mutation, and 
those with high ME1 expression had unfavoura-
ble OS outcomes (HR: 2.169, 95% CI: 1.163–
4.043, p = 0.015; HR: 1.945, 95% CI: 
1.073–3.525, p = 0.028; HR: 1.823, 95% CI: 
1.030–3.228, p = 0.039). Although patients with 
CN-AML in GSE6891 dataset are all younger 
than 60 years old, results of multivariate Cox 
regression analysis also revealed the indepen-
dently prognostic role of ME1.These findings 
underscore the independent predictive signifi-
cance of ME1 for EFS and OS in patients with 
CN-AML.
A novel risk model based on the ME1 
expression exhibits good predictive power for 
OS in patients with CN-AML
Based on the outcomes of multivariate Cox 
regression analysis, a novel risk model for pre-
dicting OS in CN-AML patients using data from 
the TCGA database was developed. The risk 
model incorporated age (< 60 years old or not), 
the DNMT3A status (yes or no) and ME1 expres-
sion (low or high), along with OS time and sur-
vival status. The resulting concordance index 
(C-index) of our model was 0.680 with a 95% CI 
of 0.610–0.751 (p  < 0.001). A nomogram

illustrating 1-, 3- and 5-year OS was constructed 
(Figure 2(a)). Employing this novel risk model, 
the 79 patients with CN-AML in the TCGA 
database were divided into low- and high-risk 
groups, revealing a significantly worse outcome 
in the high-risk group (HR: 2.670, 95% CI: 
1.54–4.65, p < 0.001; Figure 2(b)). Additionally, 
the 1-, 3- and 5-year receiver operating charac-
teristic (ROC) curves and area under the curve 
(AUC) values were used to assess the sensitivity 
and specificity of the model (Figure 2(c)). To 
validate the risk model, we utilized the 
BeatAML2.0 dataset (OHSU, Portland, Oregon, 
USA) as the validation cohort. A total of 70 
newly diagnosed CN-AML patients were finally 
included in the analysis. The results of Kaplan–
Meier survival analysis (Supplemental Figure 
S2A) and the ROC analysis (Supplemental 
Figure S2B) suggest that our risk model performs 
well.
ME1 knockdown inhibits proliferation and 
induces apoptosis in AML cell lines
To explore the functional role of ME1 in AML, 
ME1 expression in several AML cell lines was ini-
tially examined. The RT-qPCR results indicated 
a relatively higher expression of ME1 in NB4 and

THP-1 cells. In contrast, MV4-11 cells exhibited 
the lowest ME1 expression (Supplemental Figure 
S1). Therefore, siRNAs were used to knock down 
the ME1 gene in NB4 and THP-1 cells, while 
MV4-11 cell line was utilized to overexpress ME1 
gene. The knockdown efficiency confirmed by 
RT-qPCR (Figure 3(a)) and Western blotting 
(Figure 3(b)). Notably, for subsequent experi-
ments, siRNA2 (Si2) and siRNA3 (Si3) targeting 
ME1 were selected.
Cell viability, assessed by the CCK-8 assay, 
revealed that ME1 knockdown significantly 
inhibited the proliferation of THP-1 and NB4 
cells, while overexpression of ME1 significantly 
promoted the proliferation of MV4-11 cells 
(Figure 3(c)). Flow cytometry analysis of apopto-
sis demonstrated a substantial induction of apop-
tosis in THP-1 and NB4 cells (Figure 4(a) and 
(b)). Apoptosis-related proteins were assessed by 
Western blotting after transfection of AML cells

with siRNAs targeting ME1 for 48 h (Figure 
4(c)). Notably, MV4-11 cells transfected with a 
negative control plasmid (NC) did not exhibit 
significant apoptosis, and overexpression of ME1 
only resulted in a slight decrease in apoptosis 
(Figure 4(a) and (b)). Accordingly, the levels of 
apoptosis-related proteins in MV4-11 cells did 
not show significant changes (Figure 4(c)). 
Overall, these results confirm the role of ME1 in 
regulating proliferation and apoptosis in AML 
cells.

and GSE6891 datasets were categorised into two 
groups based on the ME1 expression, respec-
tively. Subsequently, several hallmark gene sets 
were identified in the ME1 high-expression 
group, with the top 10 from the TCGA and 
GSE6891 datasets shown in Figure 5(a). Notably, 
the IL-6_JAK_STAT3_SIGNALLING gene set 
was significantly enriched both in the TCGA 
database (normalised enrichment score 
(NES) = 1.848, p = 0.002, FDR = 0.074) and the 
GSE6891 dataset (NES = 1.585, p = 0.004, 
FDR = 0.043; Figure 5(b)).
To validate the gene set enrichment analysis 
(GSEA), we first analysed the correlation between 
ME1 and IL6 expression in 151 AML patients 
from the TCGA database and found a moderate 
correlation (R = 0.347, p < 0.05). Further analysis 
of the CN-AML subgroup showed that ME1 and 
IL6 maintained a moderate correlation (R = 0.464, 
p < 0.05; Supplemental Figure S4). Next, 
RT-qPCR and Western blotting assays were per-
formed in THP-1, NB4 and MV4-11 cells. 
RT-qPCR showed that reducing ME1 expression 
decreases IL6 mRNA levels, while increasing 
ME1 expression raises IL6 mRNA levels 
(Supplemental Figure S5). The result of Western 
blotting revealed that ME1 knockdown signifi-
cantly decreased IL-6, p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 lev-
els. In contrast, overexpressing ME1 led to an 
increase in these proteins (Figure 5(c)). 
Furthermore, exogenous IL-6 into THP-1 cells 
with or without ME1 knockdown were intro-
duced to confirm the regulatory relationship 
between ME1 and the IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 path-
way (Figure 5(d)). In brief, in the negative con-
trol groups (NC), adding exogenous IL-6 
activated the IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 pathway, while 
ME1 expression remained largely unchanged, 
suggesting that IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 pathway does 
not regulate ME1 expression. In the ME1 knock-
down groups (siRNA-ME1), silencing ME1 sig-
nificantly reduced the activity of the IL-6/JAK2/
STAT3 pathway. When IL-6 was added to the 
ME1 knockdown cells (siRNA-ME1 + IL-6), the 
pathway activity was partially restored, but ME1 
expression remained unchanged. These findings 
indicate that ME1 serves as an upstream regula-
tor in the IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 pathway. 
Meanwhile, we knocked down ME1 and added 
IL-6 in THP-1 cells and observed that the addi-
tion of IL-6 could rescue the effects of ME1 
knockdown, further validating that ME1 regu-
lates proliferation (Supplemental Figure S3A) 
and apoptosis (Supplemental Figure S3B) 
through the IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 pathway.
Discussion
Research on CN-AML has gained considerable 
attention due to the heterogeneity of these 
patients. By using public databases, several poten-
tial genes with prognostic or therapeutic signifi-
cance in CN-AML have been identified. In this 
study, univariate and multivariate Cox regression 
analyses were conducted to demonstrate the 
independent prognostic role of the ME1 gene in 
patients with CN-AML across the TCGA data-
base and three independent GEO datasets. 
Notably, while the GSE71014 dataset primarily 
comprises Asians,
15 the three other cohorts 
(TCGA and two GEO datasets) predominantly 
comprise Europeans, suggesting the universal 
applicability of ME1 as a prognostic marker in 
patients with CN-AML.
Furthermore, prognostic models incorporating 
gene signatures have been developed to enhance 
risk stratification in patients with CN-AML.
16–20 
Herein, a novel prognostic risk model for OS in 
patients with CN-AML was constructed based on 
ME1 gene expression. The prognosis-related risk 
model incorporated age, the DNMT3A mutation 
status and ME1 expression. In this study, we used 
the C-index to assess the difference between the 
predicted and actual values of the COX model in 
survival analysis. This metric is commonly 
employed to evaluate the predictive accuracy of 
patient prognosis models. Generally, a C-index 
value between 0.5 and 0.7 reflects lower accu-
racy, whereas a value exceeding 0.9 signifies 
higher accuracy, thereby providing a clearer con-
text for our findings.
21,22 Our C-index result was 
0.680, with a 95% CI of 0.610–0.751 (p < 0.001), 
suggesting that the model has a reasonable accu-
racy for predicting OS in patients with CN-AML. 
Additionally, validation through the construction 
of the AUC-ROC survival model further con-
firmed the significance of ME1 expression as a 
crucial variable in predicting the survival progno-
sis of CN-AML, establishing its role as a robust 
predictor of OS in patients with CN-AML.
Several studies have documented ME1 as a pro-
oncogenic gene across various cancer types.

while promoting oxidative stress and apoptosis in 
tumour cells.10,23,24 Inhibitors targeting ME1 have 
been designed, demonstrating the ability to 
inhibit the growth of human colorectal cancer 
cells in vitro.
25,26 Notably, a recent discovery 
identified a highly selective small-molecule inhib-
itor of ME1, AS1134900, providing compelling 
evidence for the potential of drug targeting ME1 
in cancer.
27 Despite previous studies highlighting 
novel potential markers in CN-AML, few have 
delved into the underlying molecular mechanisms 
of these prognostic genes.
3 In this study, ME1 
knockdown induced the inhibition of prolifera-
tion and apoptosis in AML cell lines. Additionally, 
GSEA based on ME1 expression in TCGA and 
GSE6891 revealed a significant enrichment of the 
IL-6/JAK/STAT3 signature. The IL-6/JAK/
STAT3 pathway plays a crucial role in the growth 
and development of various human cancers, 
including AML, with its activation leading to 
downstream target genes such as cyclin D1 and 
B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (BCL-xL), promot-
ing tumour proliferation and survival.
28,29 
Consistent with GSEA results, downregulation of 
IL-6, p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 after ME1 silencing 
was observed, whereas overexpressing ME1 
increased the levels of these proteins. Notably, 
the use of exogenous IL-6 rescued the effects of 
ME1 silencing, confirming the regulatory role of 
ME1 on the IL-6/JAK2/STAT3 pathway.
While this study revealed important discoveries, 
it has some limitations. First, analyses for 
patients with CN-AML in the datasets were 
grouped based on the median expression of the 
ME1 gene without absolute cut points. Second, 
due to the challenges in tracking patients with 
CN-AML and the limited sample size, the ME1 
expression was not examined and long-term fol-
low-up for patients with CN-AML in the real-
world setting was not conducted. Further, larger 
studies are warranted to establish a standardised 
method for quantifying ME1 expression and val-
idating its prognostic role in patients with 
CN-AML.
Conclusion
The prognostic significance and functional mech-
anism of the ME1 gene in patients with CN-AML 
was first explored, offering evidence that ME1 
could serve as a potential therapeutic target for 
individuals with CN-AML.
