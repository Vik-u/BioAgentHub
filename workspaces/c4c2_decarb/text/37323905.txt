Cyanobacteria are an excellent microbial photosynthetic plat form for sustainable
carbon dioxide ﬁxation. One bottleneck to limit its application is that the
natural carbon ﬂow pathway almost transfers CO /two.tnumto glycogen/biomass
other than designed biofuels such as ethanol. Here, we used eng ineered
Synechocystis sp. PCC /six.tnum/eight.tnum/zero.tnum/three.tnum to explore CO/two.tnum-to-ethanol potential under
atmospheric environment. First, we investigated the eﬀects o f two heterologous
genes (pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase) on e thanol
biosynthesis and optimized their promoter. Furthermore, t he main carbon
ﬂow of the ethanol pathway was strengthened by blocking glycogen storage
and pyruvate-to-phosphoenolpyruvate backﬂow. To recycle carbo n atoms that
escaped from the tricarboxylic acid cycle, malate was artiﬁcially guide d back
into pyruvate, which also created NADPH balance and promoted acetald ehyde
conversion into ethanol. Impressively, we achieved high-rate e thanol production
(/two.tnum/four.tnum/eight.tnum mg/L/day at early /four.tnum days) by ﬁxing atmospheric CO/two.tnum. Thus, this study
exhibits the proof-of-concept that rewiring carbon ﬂow strateg ies could provide
an eﬃcient cyanobacterial platform for sustainable biofuel pro duction from
atmospheric CO /two.tnum.

/one.tnum. Introduction
The increased level of atmospheric greenhouse gas arises the concern of seeking
environmentally friendly technologies to ﬁx and even reuse CO 2 as an energy chemical
(Fang et al., 2021 ). Microbial CO 2 ﬁxation has received much attention because of its highly
renewable reaction under mild conductions ( Gassler et al., 2020 ; Satanowski and Bar-Even,
2020; Chen et al., 2023a ,b). Among those biotechnologies, photo-driven CO 2 bioconversion
represents one of the sustainable strategies to generate carbon-neutral biofuels, such as
ethanol and butanol (
Liu et al., 2019 ; Velmurugan and Incharoensakdi, 2020 ; Fang et al.,
2022). Thus, it is urgent to develop a photo-driven biosynthesis platform for CO 2-to-
biofuel production.

Graphical Abstract
Carbon ﬂux rewiring enables high rate of CO /two.tnum-to-ethanol in photosynthetic microorganism.
Cyanobacterium owns high photosynthesis eﬃciency
(theoretical maximum is 8–10%) and has the potential to convert
CO2 into biofuels through the Calvin–Benson–Bassham (CBB)
cycle (
Santos-Merino et al., 2021 ). Notably, it has successfully
engineered cyanobacteria to assimilate CO 2 and produce value-
added chemicals, such as ethylene ( Li et al., 2021 ), isoprene
(Lindberg et al., 2010 ), ethanol ( Gao et al., 2012 ), isobutanol
(Miao et al., 2017 ), acetone ( Lee et al., 2020 ), and p-coumaric
acid ( Gao et al., 2021 ). Ethanol as a simple but major renewable
biofuel can be easily produced by introducing two heterologous
enzymes (pyruvate decarboxylase and alcohol dehydrogenase)
in cyanobacteria (
Gao et al., 2012 ). The model cyanobacterium
of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter Synechocystis) shows
double ethanol yield compared to other cyanobacteria such
as Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 (
Dexter and Fu, 2009 ).
Furthermore, Synechocystis owns clear genetic background to
assemble and engineer heterologous pathways, indicating the
promising future of CO 2-to-ethanol production (
Zhang and
Bryant, 2011).
Recently, many eﬀorts have been explored to promote ethanol
production in Synechocystis. Optimization of abiotic and biotic
factors showed positive eﬀects on cell growth and ethanol synthesis
(
Heidorn et al., 2011 ; Gao et al., 2012 ). Overexpressing the
ethanol-producing steps or blocking the production of storage
polymers (glycogen and polyhydroxybutyrate) was able to increase
ethanol production (
Namakoshi et al., 2016 ; Velmurugan and
Incharoensakdi, 2020 ). The enhancement of carbon ﬁxation in
the CBB cycle also signiﬁcantly improved the ethanol yield as
well as cell growth (
Liang et al., 2018 ; Roussou et al., 2021 ). In
addition, co-culture engineering and modular engineering were
systematic strategies to achieve high-level ethanol production in
photosynthetic microorganisms (
Liu et al., 2019 ; Velmurugan and
Incharoensakdi, 2020 ). However, it is diﬃcult to channel the ﬁxed
carbon atoms into the target product because of the imbalance
of cell growth rate and ethanol byproduct accumulation (
Luan
et al., 2020 ). The above strategies are still challenging to adjust
the ethanol pathway in one system and are rarely explored in
systematic investigations on promoter optimization, byproduct
blocking, and cofactor regeneration on ethanol accumulation.
In addition, eﬃciently ﬁxing atmospheric CO 2 into ethanol via
Synechocystis is still due to a lack of study.
Herein, to investigate the ethanol-producing potential of
optimizing metabolic pathways, the engineered Synechocystis cells
were genetically modiﬁed in a stepwise approach via inhibiting the
phosphoenolpyruvate pathway from pyruvate, removing glycogen
storage, and shunting carbon metabolic ﬂux of the tricarboxylic
acid cycle. This approach leads to proof-of-concept with high-
eﬃcient ethanol production directly from solar energy and
atmospheric CO2 and signiﬁcantly contributes to the sustainability
of CO2-to-biofuel conversion.

photons m −2 s−1 and 30 ◦C). Unless otherwise noted, appropriate
antibiotics were added to the BG11 medium.
/two.tnum./two.tnum. Plasmid construction for gene
knockout
The pMD18-T vector (TaKaRa, Dalian) is used as a backbone
to construct cyanobacterial plasmids, which are presented in
Supplementary Table S1. Using PCR to amplify the fragments, the
fragment and the vector were double-digested by recombinase
(NEW ENGLAND BioLabs Beijing, China). Corresponding
primers (
SupplementaryTable S2) were used to clone up/down-
fragments of the Synechocystis genome, and T4 ligase (NEB,
Beijing) was used for ligation. The recombinant pBE406
plasmid (containing 600 bp upstream/downstream slr0168
and spectinomycin resistance gene) for gene knockout is shown
in
Supplementary Figure S2 . Similarly, pMD-slr0301- Ω and
pMD-slr1176-Ω were constructed. Otherwise, to construct
a recombinant ethanol pathway, the synthesized pdc and
yqhD genes (Sangon Biotech Co Ltd., Shanghai) coupled with
promoters ( PpetE or PpsbA2s) and TrbcL terminator were
designed in pBE02/pBE03 (see the target genes including other
resistance genes in
Supplementary Table S1). Plasmid pBE09 was
constructed by inserting the PpsbA2s-maeB expression cassette
(maeB gene cloned from E. coli) and TrbcL terminator into the
pMD-slr1176-Ω vector.
/two.tnum./three.tnum. Engineered cyanobacteria construction
Synechocystis cells collected at the exponential phase ( ∼1
OD730) were washed with a fresh BG11 medium three times,
and then mixed with plasmids (100 ng DNA to 100 µ l
cyanobacteria) for 5 h and illuminated incubation at 30 ◦C.
The above mixture was streaked on a sterile ﬁlter membrane
for another 24 h of illuminated incubation on the BG11 solid
medium. To select the corrected mutant, the ﬁlter membrane was
further transferred to a solid BG11 medium with corresponding
antibiotics. After 2 weeks, single clones sub-cultured on solid
plates were isolated in a liquid BG11 medium for analysis.
All the strains referred to in this study are presented in
Table 1.
The slr0301 gene is a gene encoding phosphoenolpyruvate
synthase (PpsA) in the genome of Synechocystis sp.
PCC6803, which catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate to
phosphoenolpyruvate. The absence of this gene increases the
accumulation of the intermediate pyruvate. The slr1176 gene
is a gene encoding glucose-1-phosphate adenylate transferase
in the genome of PCC6803, which catalyzes the conversion of
glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) to ADP-glucose. It is a major rate-
limiting enzyme in glycogen synthesis, and its absence can lead to
complete inhibition of glycogen synthesis. The slr0168is a neutral
gene in PCC6803 algae cells, and knocking out this gene has no
eﬀect on the growth of algae cells, making it a commonly used
expression platform.

/two.tnum./four.tnum. Ethanol production and analytical
methods
For ethanol production, all the mutants were cultured in a
fresh BG11 medium with an initial 0.1 OD 730 and cultivated
photoautotrophically in a ﬂask (50 µ mol photons m −2 s−1
without additional CO 2 injection). Notably, the BG11 medium of
SYN001 contains 500 nM copper ions to induce the expression of
ethanol-producing genes (
Ghassemian et al., 1994 ; Choi and Park,
2016). After centrifugation and ﬁltration, supernatant with ethanol
was submitted for high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) analysis using an Aminex HPX-87H column (Bio-Rad,
United States) (
Seo et al., 2017 ).
/two.tnum./five.tnum. Transcription level analysis
Synechocystis wild-type culture and mutants at 0.6 OD 730
were collected after centrifugation (3,500 ×g, 15 min, 4 ◦C). RNA
extraction and quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR)
analysis were performed according to the previous methods
(
Gao et al., 2012 ). The relative transcription levels of targeted
genes were estimated using the calculation method of 2 −/Delta1/Delta1CT,
in which a higher /Delta1CT value means low transcription ( Livak
and Schmittgen, 2001 ). The endogenous 16S rRNA was set as a
reference gene. All experimental groups were carried out with three
biological replicates.
/two.tnum./six.tnum. Statistical analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism
(version 8.01, United States). The diﬀerence in this study was
compared by unpaired t-test and statistical signiﬁcance was set at
p < 0.05. ∗∗ represents p < 0.01 and ∗∗∗ represents p < 0.001.

/three.tnum./one.tnum. Synthetic ethanol pathway
optimization
Generally, there are two precursors (pyruvate and acetyl-
CoA) that are involved in ethanol synthesis (
Gao et al.,
2012). To determine the optimal ethanol pathway in engineered
Synechocystis, the concentrations of those two metabolites were
investigated ( Supplementary Figure S1 ). Interestingly, pyruvate
linking to the CBB cycle and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
exhibited higher concentration (1.05 µ mol/gDW, approximately
three times that of acetyl-CoA), indicating that pyruvate was more
suitable to serve as the ethanol precursor. Therefore, we attempted
to optimize the carbon ﬂow network by selecting a strong pyruvate-
acetaldehyde-ethanol pathway.
The synthetic ethanol pathway contained pyruvate
decarboxylase (PDC) from Zymomonas mobilis and
alcohol dehydrogenase (YqhD) from Escherichia coli
(
Supplementary Figure S2 ). Those two enzymes exhibited high
activities to convert pyruvate into acetaldehyde and subsequently
reduce acetaldehyde into ethanol in other microorganisms
(
Atsumi et al., 2009 ; Gao et al., 2012 ). The slr0168 gene
not aﬀecting cell growth or photosynthesis was primarily
chosen as an exchange site according to previous reports
(
Dexter and Fu, 2009 ; Gao et al., 2012 ). Vectors containing
upstream/downstream slr0168 gene, antibiotic resistance gene
(spectinomycin, Sp R), various promoters, target genes ( pdc-yqhD),
and terminator TrbcL were constructed and integrated into
the Synechocystis genome to obtain stable ethanol-producing
recombinants ( Supplementary Figure S3 ). Those two strains
(SYN001 and SYN002) showed similar growth rates to wild-type
Synechocystis (
Figure 1A).
Subsequently, promoter optimization to adjust the
transcription level of pdc and yqhD was conducted. The RT-
qPCR results showed that strong promoter PpsbA2s in recombinant
SYN002 obviously improved pdc-yqhD transcription levels,
∼2-fold compared to medium-level promoter PpetE in SYN001
(Figure 1B and Supplementary Figure S4 ). As expected, both
recombinants achieved obvious accumulation of ethanol (rarely
detected in wild-type Synechocystis), and SYN002 yielded the
highest titer (474 mg/L) at 7 days (
Figure 1C). Thus, a basic
cyanobacterium with photosynthetic CO 2-to-ethanol ability
was obtained.

/three.tnum./two.tnum. Eﬀect of phosphoenolpyruvate
synthase and glycogen synthesis knockout
Blocking carbon loss (phosphoenolpyruvate backﬂow and
glycogen synthesis) was conducted to learn their eﬀects on CO 2-to-
ethanol production (
Figure 2A). From metabolic network analysis
(Supplementary Figures S1, S2 ) and literature investigation
(Angermayr et al., 2014 ; Dienst et al., 2014 ), we learned that
native Synechocystis could remarkably turn pyruvate back into
the upstream module via highly active phosphoenolpyruvate
synthase (PpsA, referred to slr0301 gene). To abolish competitive
consumption of pyruvate, we constructed a new cassette (pMD-
PpsbA2s-pdc-yqhD) to exchange the slr0301 gene on the genome
(
Figure 2B). The newly obtained recombinant SYN003 ( /Delta1slr0301)
exhibited 600 mg/L ethanol yield after 7 days of photosynthetic CO 2
conversion ( Figure 2C) and approximately 1.3-fold improvement
compared to PpsA-existed SYN002. Furthermore, to enhance
photosynthetic carbon ﬂux toward the CO 2-to-ethanol pathway,
a key gene slr1176 related to glycogen synthesis was knocked
out via gene exchange cassette (pMD- slr1176-Ω ) (
Figure 2B).
Impressively, the ethanol yield was further improved via double-
knockout recombinant SYN007 ( /Delta1slr0301 /Delta1slr1176) and obtained
more than 700 mg/L titer (
Figure 2C). Pyruvate was deduced as a
carbon sink in the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas pathway according
to the previous study of glycogen synthesis abolishment (
Van Der
Woude et al., 2014 ). The increased carbon ﬂux of CO 2-to-pyruvate
probably supported the pyruvate-utilizing reaction of ethanol
accumulation. Interestingly, it slightly inhibited cell growth when
blocking glycogen synthesis at the slr1176 site (
Figure 2C). We
deduced that the shift of excessive carbon from the glycolytic
pathway and pentose phosphate pathway to ethanol pathway
resulted in carbon deﬁciency of biomass synthesis (
Young et al.,
2011).
/three.tnum./three.tnum. Eﬀect of malic enzyme overexpression
on ethanol production
The engineered strains in cell proliferation stage should use
the TCA cycle to support biomass synthesis, however, resulting in
carbon atom loss (

glyoxylate ﬂux to reduce the carbon loss between isocitrate

and succinate ( Supplementary Figure S2 ). Malate close to the
end of the TCA cycle was selected as the key metabolite for
carbon recycling through an NADP +-dependent malic enzyme
from E. coli (
Yoshikawa et al., 2015 ), which not only converted
malate into pyruvate but also increased pyruvate and NADPH
pool (
Figure 3A). The maeB gene was introduced into the
slr1176 site of SYN003, establishing the recombinant SYN009
(Figure 3B). Intriguingly, the cell growth of Synechocystis was
rescued, and the SYN009 showed a little fast proliferation after
3 days of photoautotrophic growth (
Supplementary Figure S6 ).
Under simulated sunlight source, SYN009 used CO 2 as a sole
carbon source to produce 1.09 g/L ethanol ( Figure 3C and
Supplementary Figure S5 ). Impressively, the time curve showed
that before 4 days, SYN009 achieved 248 mg/L/day productivity,
the fastest accumulation rate compared to other literature
studies (
Table 2).
The metabolic ﬂux imbalance between metabolism and
synthesis is a big challenge limiting target product yield in microbial
cell factories (
Oliver et al., 2013 ). Choosing suitable promoters to
overexpress PDC/YqhD has been usually considered to enhance the
carbon ﬂux toward ethanol (
Dexter and Fu, 2009 ; Gao et al., 2012 ),
which also exhibited positive results of ethanol production in this
study (
Supplementary Figure S5 ). In addition, the overexpression
of key enzymes in the CBB cycle was another important strategy
to supply suﬃcient carbon ﬂux in the form of 3-phosphoglycerate
(
Liang et al., 2018 ; Roussou et al., 2021 ). Compared to previous
reports ( Table 2), the carbon ﬂow optimization strategy in our
study consumed the minimum number of days to achieve the
highest ethanol productivity of ∼248 mg/L/day (
Table 1). It
indicated that a comprehensive and precise adjustment of carbon
ﬂow is promising to improve CO 2-to-ethanol production in
cyanobacteria. Notably, this photosynthetic cell factory still faces
the challenge of cell density (
Supplementary Figure S6 ), such as
only ∼0.6 OD 730 increase after 7 days of cultivation under light
and atmospheric CO 2. New strategies, such as co-cultivation and
batch culture with high density, can probably yield outstanding
ethanol production (
Namakoshi et al., 2016 ; Velmurugan and
Incharoensakdi, 2020).
