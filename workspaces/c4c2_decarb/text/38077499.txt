Abstract
Central metabolism produces carbohydrates and amino acids that are tightly correlated to plant growth and thereby crop productivity.
Malate is reported to link mitochondrial respiratory metabolism with cytosolic biosynthetic pathways. Although the function of malate
metabolism-related enzymes in providing carbon has been characterized in some plants, evidence for this role in the fleshy fruit
of cucumber is lacking. Here, radiolabeled bicarbonate fed into the xylem stream from the cucumber roots was incorporated into
amino acids, soluble sugars, and organic acids in the exocarp and vasculature of fruits. The activities of decarboxylases, especially
decarboxylation from NADP-dependent malic enzyme (NADP-ME), were higher in cucumber fruit than in the leaf lamina. Histochemical
localization revealed that CsNADP-ME2 was mainly located in the exocarp and vascular bundle system of fruit. Radiotracer and gas-
exchange analysis indicated that overexpression ofCsNADP-ME2 could promote carbon flux into soluble sugars and starch in fruits.
Further studies combined with metabolic profiling revealed that the downregulation ofCsNADP-ME2 in RNA interference (RNAi) lines
caused the accumulation of its substrate, malate, in the exocarp. In addition to inhibition of glycolysis-related gene expression and
reduction of the activities of the corresponding enzymes, increased amino acid synthesis and decreased sugar abundance were also
observed in these lines. The opposite effect was found inCsNADP-ME2-overexpressing lines, suggesting that there may be a continuous
bottom-up feedback regulation of glycolysis in cucumber fruits. Overall, our studies indicate thatCsNADP-ME2 may play potential roles
in both central carbon reactions and amino acid metabolism in cucumber fruits.
Introduction
Carbon and nitrogen are the most vital elements in all living
things, including plants, animals, and microbes. Plant develop-
ment and the production of crops are closely associated with the
regulation of carbon and nitrogen metabolism [1]. Carboxylate
metabolism-related enzymes are proposed to contribute to
carbon and nitrogen metabolic pathways in several plant species
[2, 3]. For example, increased malic enzyme flux and lipid
abundance along with altered amino acid and fatty acid levels
were observed in the seeds of homozygous transgenic soybean
plants that expressed Arabidopsis malic enzyme alleles [4]. In
transgenic tomato plants, the activity of mitochondrial malate
dehydrogenase is suppressed, which enhances aerial growth and
carbon absorption [5]. When the NAD-dependent malic enzyme
(NAD-ME) is deficient inArabidopsis, excess malate is significantly
diverted to amino acid production at night-time [ 6]. A basic
metabolic pathway that is irreversible in plants is catalyzed by
the enzyme phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC). Reduced
PEPC activity in the Arabidopsis ppc1/ppc2 double mutant was
shown to result in repressed ammonium absorption, impaired
synthesis of malate and citrate, and higher starch and sucrose
buildup, proving the critical function of PEPC in controlling the
balance of carbon and nitrogen metabolism [
7]. Similarly , the 2-
oxoglutarate/malate translocator plays two roles in the malate
valve and carbon/nitrogen metabolism inArabidopsis, mediating
the biosynthesis of amino acid and storage proteins in pea embryo
[
2, 3]. These works collectively indicate that strategies to control
enzymes involved in organic acid metabolism would likely be
effective means of regulating plant carbon/nitrogen metabolism.
Malate is a prominent metabolite that occupies a crucial node
in the regulation of the metabolism of carbon in plants. It relates
mitochondrial respiratory metabolism to cytosolic biosynthetic
pathways [
8]. Malate has been shown to exert important functions
in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and metabolite signaling
[9, 10]. The oxidative decarboxylation of malate to create
pyruvate, CO2, and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide
phosphate (NADPH) is catalyzed by the NADP-dependent malic
enzyme (NADP-ME), which has also been linked to normal plant
growth and stress responses [ 11–13]. In plants, NADP-ME is
encoded by multiple genes with different expression patterns and

biochemical properties, whose gene products are localized in
either the cytosol or the plastid [ 14–16]. In Arabidopsis,t h r e e
cytosolic informs (AtNADP-ME1–3) and a plastidic isoform
(AtNADP-ME4) were identified [15]. Following phylogenetic analy-
sis, AtNADP-ME1 clusters in the same group with maize (Zea mays)
cytosolic NADP-ME (ZmCytNADP-ME) [ 17], which has similar
expression patterns and kinetic properties [ 18]. AtNADP-ME2
shares 90% identity with AtNADP-ME3 at the protein level, and
both group with cytosolic dicot sequences in a phylogenetic tree
[15]. The plastidic isoform AtNADP-ME4 resembles maize plastidic
isoforms (ZmC4-NADP-ME and Zm-nonC4-NADP-ME) in kinetic
characterization and groups with plastidic dicot sequences in a
phylogenetic tree [
17], suggesting that a C3 plastidic isoform may
be an ancestor of the photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic
plastidic isoforms found in C4 plants [18]. Although Arabidopsis
isoforms are highly homologous, they differ in expression trends
and function [14, 15]. AtNADP-ME1 is confined to maturing seeds
and secondary roots, and is necessary in the abscisic acid response
and seed germination during dry storage [
19, 20]. AtNADP-ME2 is
responsible for the major enzymatic activity in all mature organs.
This protein is implicated in sugar metabolism in veins [21], in the
production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [22], and in maintain-
ing redox and carbon cellular balances in plants [23]. AtNADP-
ME3 is exclusively expressed in trichomes and pollens [ 15].
AtNADP-ME4 is expressed constitutively in reproductive or vege-
tative organs and plays a critical role in lipid metabolism [14, 15].
In plants, NADP-ME is reported to be regulated by several
processes, according to extensive research. Some plants possess
regulatory components that affect the expression of theNADP-
ME gene in a cell-specific manner [24]. For example, in trans-
genic tobacco plants it has been discovered that the promoter
of the common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) NADP-ME gene strongly
regulates expression in tissues such as those surrounding the
vascular, floral, and reproductive systems [
25]. Another example
is the promoters of AtNADP-ME2 and AtNADP-ME4 from Ara-
bidopsis, which were verified to direct pronounced expression
to the middle vein and, to variable degrees, to the minor veins
[21]. Likewise, an ancestral G-box recognized by basic helix–loop–
helix transcription factors in theNADP-ME promoter of the C4
crop maize is also present in C3 species [26]. RPM1-INDUCED
PROTEIN KINASE (RIPK), a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, may
directly phosphorylate and activate AtNADP-ME2 to sustain ROS
production inArabidopsis [27].
The rapid development and growth of fleshy cucumber
(Cucumis sativus ) fruit require significant sources of carbon
and nitrogen. Researchers have reported that monosaccharides
like glucose and fructose are the primary carbohydrates that
accumulate in mature cucumber fruit [
28, 29]. We previously
reported the coincidentally rapid accumulation of organic acids
and increased PEPC activity during cucumber fruit development
[
30]. Our results also indicated that cucumber fruits displayed
complicated vascular anatomy [31] and complex photosynthetic
characteristics [30]. Peripheral (PeVB), main (MVB), carpel (CVB),
and placental vascular bundles (PlVB) are among the four
sets of functionally differentiated vascular bundles from the
outside to the inside of the fruits of cucumber plants, which are
distinguished from the vascular networks in the leaves, petiole,
stems, and peduncle [
31, 32]. However, so far, thein vivofunctions
of CsNADP-ME in the metabolism of nitrogen and carbon in
cucumber fruits are not clear. Here, we used a combination of
transgenesis,
14C feeding, and cellular localization experiments
as well as metabolic profiling to illustrate the pivotal role of
the malate decarboxylase-encoding geneCsNADP-ME2 in carbon
reaction and amino acid metabolism of cucumber fruit. Taken
together, our study reveals a potential mechanism by which
malate decarboxylase may act in the network integration of
carbohydrate synthesis and primary metabolism in this non-
foliar organ. Our study also offers a promising approach for
enhancing the yield and quality of fleshy fruit in cucumber.
Results
Cucumber fruit contained considerable
proportions of radiolabel generated from root-fed
14C-bicarbonate
According to several studies, organic acids from the transpiration
stream may supply carbon to cells associated with the veins of
plants including rice, tobacco, andArabidopsis, and those cells
with high C4 acid decarboxylase activity may rapidly release CO2
[21, 24, 33, 34]. Cucumber fruits contain four sets of vascular bun-
dles with intricate structural connections [31]. Here, we speculate
whether these types of vascular cells in cucumber fruits could
play a synergistic role in the reuse of carbon from substrates
supplied to the stream of transpiration. To test this, first we
supplied
14C-labelled bicarbonate ([14C]NaHCO3)t ot h ex y l e m
stream via the root of cucumber plants (Fig. 1A). The radionu-
clides were accordingly detected in the exocarp, PeVB, MVB, and
placenta tissues of cucumber fruits (Fig. 1B and C). Secondly , thin-
layer chromatography (TLC) followed by scintillation counting
was employed to isolate and quantify radiolabel in soluble sub-
stances to further determine the fate of14C. High concentrations
of radiolabel derived from [14C]NaHCO3 were identified in amino
acids such as alanine (∼20.0% of total soluble material) and
organic acids such as malate (∼15.4% of total soluble material).
However, the majority was present as soluble sugars, particularly
hexoses (Fig. 1D). Specifically , fructose represented∼34.5% of the
total soluble material, followed by glucose (∼26.7%) and sucrose
(∼3.4%) (Fig. 1D). It seems likely that the cells surrounding the
vascular tissues of cucumber fruits could be supplied with carbon
from C4 acid via xylem transpiration.
Spatiotemporal expression and enzyme activity
of decarboxylases in cucumber fruits
In cucumber, our data from laser capture microdissection-derived
RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) revealed that the genes encoding C4
acid decarboxylases, such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
(PEPCK), NAD-dependent malic enzyme (NAD-ME), and NADP-
ME [31, 32], were exclusively expressed in the vasculature in the
stem, petiole, and fruit (
Supplementary Data Fig. S1), and the
mRNA level ofCsNADP-ME2 was significantly higher than that of
other C4 acid decarboxylase genes (Supplementary Data Fig. S1).
Four candidate CsNADP-ME genes were identified in cucumber
(Supplementary Data Fig. S2A) and named according to their
homologs in Arabidopsis [15]. Multiple sequence alignment of
Arabidopsis AtNADP-ME1–4 with cucumber orthologs indicated
76.60% homology (Supplementary Data Fig. S2A), and showed
strong conservation of residues involved in the active site
binding of malate or pyruvate (Supplementary Data Fig. S2A)
[4, 35]. NADP-MEs in plants can be classified into four groups
[15]: groups I and II comprise cytosolic and plastidic isoforms
from dicots, respectively; group III contains isoforms from
monocots; and group IV is composed of isoforms from both
monocots and dicots, e.g. CsNADP-ME2 and AtNADP-ME1
(
Supplementary Data Fig. S2B). Phylogenetic analysis revealed
high similarity between cucumber and Arabidopsis orthologs
(Supplementary Data Fig. S2B).

We next investigated gene expression and enzyme activity of
these three decarboxylases (CsNADP-ME,Fig. 2A and B; CsPEPCK,
Fig. 2C and D;a n dC s N A D - M E ,Fig. 2E and F) in cucumber fruits
and leaf lamina as control. Among theCsNADP-ME genes, both
CsNADP-ME2 and CsNADP-ME4 were expressed at high levels,
while CsNADP-ME1 and CsNADP-ME3 were barely detectable in
leaves and fruits (Fig. 2A), which is consistent with the RNA-
s e qd a t a(Supplementary Data Fig. S1). Beyond this,CsNADP-ME2
transcripts (Fig. 2A) and total NADP-ME activity (Fig. 2B) displayed
higher levels in cucumber fruits. In fruits at 9 days after anthesis
(DAA), both transcript levels and enzymatic activity of NADP-
ME were higher in exocarp tissue, followed by MVB and placenta
tissues (
Fig. 2A and B). In addition, fruits expressedCsPEPCK1 at
a lower level than leaves, butCsPEPCK2 transcripts were barely
present in either tissue (Fig. 2C). In contrast to the transcriptional
pattern, the PEPCK enzyme activity was 4- to 12-fold higher in
fruits than leaves, with MVB tissue from 9-DAA fruits exhibiting
the highest activity level ( Fig. 2D). Transcripts of CsNAD-ME
family genes were similar in leaves and fruits of different
developmental stages (Fig. 2E); however, NAD-ME activity was
2- to 7-fold higher in fruits than in leaves, with the highest level
again recorded in MVB tissue (Fig. 2F). Similar to the changes
in transcript expression patterns and enzymatic activities of
the three decarboxylases, CsNADP-MDH (NADP-dependent malate
dehydrogenase)(
Supplementary Data Fig. S3A and B )a n dt h e
previously reported PPC family gene encoding PEPC [phospho-
enolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylase] [30], as well asCsPPDK (pyruvate
orthophosphate dikinase)( Supplementary Data Fig. S3C and D ),
showed lower transcripts but higher enzymatic activities in
fruits when compared with leaf lamina. Overall, in cucumber
fruits, CsNADP-ME2 was the most highly expressed member
of the genes encoding the C
4 acid decarboxylases (Fig. 2A–F;
Supplementary Data Fig. S1 ). Therefore, we next focused on
the potential function of the CsNADP-ME2 gene in cucumber
fruits.
CsNADP-ME2 is highly expressed in the exocarp,
vasculature, and placenta of cucumber fruit
Considering the enhanced expression ofCsNADP-ME2 in the exo-
carp, vasculature, and placenta tissues of cucumber fruit (Fig. 2A),
the spatial and tissue-specific localization ofCsNADP-ME2 and its
protein in cucumber leaf and ovary/fruit was further examined
using in situhybridization and immunohistochemical localization
methods, respectively (Fig. 3). In situ hybridization results indi-
cated that CsNADP-ME2 transcripts were mainly located in the
cells within and/or around the vein and palisade tissues of leaves
(Fig. 3A, B, E, and F), as well as in the exocarp, ovule, and four
sets of vascular bundle systems of fruits, namely PeVB, MVB, CVB
and PlVB (Fig. 3C, D, G, and H). Western blotting was conducted to
assess the antisera’s potency , and the findings revealed that the
anti-CsNADP-ME2 antiserum was specifically bound toCsNADP-
ME2 (
Supplementary Data Fig. S4). Localization patterns of the
CsNADP-ME2 protein, by using a secondary antibody conjugated
to either alkaline phosphatase (AP) (
Fig. 3I–P) or fluorescein isoth-
iocyanate (FITC) (Supplementary Data Fig. S5), matched those in
their respective transcripts (Fig. 3A–H).
Manipulating expression ofCsNADP-ME2
influences metabolic fluxes and respiratory gas
exchange in transgenic cucumber fruits
To further analyze the role ofCsNADP-ME2 in cucumber fruits,
overexpression (OE) and RNA interference (RNAi) constructs
of CsNADP-ME2 (Supplementary Data Fig. S6A and B )w e r e
generated and subsequently independently transformed into
cucumber cotyledon. Four OE lines and five RNAi lines were
selected from more than 20 independent T0 transgenic plants
(Supplementary Data Fig. S6C). Then, two independent OET2 lines
(OE-14 and OE-19) and three RNAiT2 lines (RNAi-2, RNAi-13, and
RNAi16) were selected based on their CsNADP-ME2 expression
levels for further study . Real-time quantitative PCR (RT–qPCR)
analysis illustrated that∼3-, 5-, 0.30-, 0.15-, and 0.20-fold tran-
script levels were detected in OE-14, OE-19, RNAi-2, RNAi-13, and
RNAi-16 lines, respectively , in contrast to wild-type (WT) plants
(
Fig. 4A), whereas the expression of the other three members
comprising CsNADP-ME1, 3,a n d4 barely changed (Fig. 4B–D).
Meanwhile, the total NADP-ME activity obviously increased in
line OE-19 but significantly decreased in all three RNAi lines
when compared with WT (Fig. 4E), suggesting thatCsNADP-ME2
is most likely the main gene responsible for NADP-ME activity
in the oxidative decarboxylation of malate. In addition, when
compared with WT, the OE lines had higher expression levels of
CsNADP-MDH while the RNAi-2 and RNAi-13 lines had lower

expression levels ( Fig. 4F). Taking these results together, the
expression of genes involved in the metabolism of malate may
be significantly impacted by alterations inCsNADP-ME2. Based on
the transcripts ofCsNADP-ME2 and other related genes, as well
as total NADP-ME activity , we selected lines OE-19, RNAi-2, and
RNAi-13 for further analysis.
We next assessed the metabolic fluxes of carbohydrates by
incubating excised pericarp discs, MVB, and placenta and seed tis-
sues from nine DAA fruits in a buffered medium containing 10 mM
[U14C] malate. After incubation, the discs were rinsed and frozen
before the labeled material was fractionated to ascertain the label
redistribution. The percentage of [U14C] malate derivatives was
higher in the OE line, but lower in the RNAi lines (Fig. 4G). Specifi-
cally , [14C] sucrose (Fig. 4H), [14C] starch (Fig. 4I), and [14C] glucose
(Fig. 4J) were significantly accumulated in the exocarp tissues of
the OE line compared with WT, while [14C] fructose abundance
rose in MVB of the OE line and one out of two RNAi lines (Fig. 4K).
Moreover, overexpression ofCsNADP-ME2 significantly increased
the sucrose-to-starch ratio in cucumber fruits compared with the
WT, whereas inCsNADP-ME2-RNAi lines obvious decreases were
observed in the sucrose/starch ratio (Fig. 4L), indicating that the
changes of CsNADP-ME2 gene expression (Fig. 4A)a n de n z y m e
activity (Fig. 4E) had larger effects on sucrose levels than on
the starch content in the transgenic cucumber plants. In gen-
eral, these results suggest that manipulating the expression of
CsNADP-ME2 may influence carbon metabolism by regulating
carbon flux into starch and soluble sugars.
Given the change of transcript and metabolite levels, gas
exchange analysis in the fruits of transgenic cucumber was
conducted according to Sui et al.[
30]. These results revealed
that a large amount of CO2 was released from peels, internal
tissues, and intact fruits in both WT plants and transgenic

lines in the dark condition (Fig. 5A). By contrast, in the light,
although net photosynthesis could not be detected in fruit
tissues, CO2 evolution decreased significantly compared with
that in the dark, especially in the intact fruits and peel tissues
rich in photosynthetic pigments, suggesting the occurrence of
CO2 absorption by the fruits under the light condition (Fig. 5A).
Furthermore, re-fixation of respiratory CO2 by the fruits was
analyzed in the light and dark conditions according to methods
described in a previous report [ 30], and was found to be
significantly improved in the OE line in the light condition when
compared with the WT (Fig. 5B). Accordingly , in contrast to WT
cucumber, fruit weight rose by 2–16% in the OE line and dropped
by 2–10% in the RNAi lines (
Fig. 5C and D), indicating the potential
contribution ofCsNADP-ME2 to the carbon acquisition of the fruit.
Altered CsNADP-ME2 mediates amino acid
metabolism in cucumber fruits
To further comprehend the roles played by CsNADP-ME2,
we additionally determined the intermediate metabolite
content in the exocarp (
Fig. 6A), MVB, and placenta tissues
(Supplementary Data Fig. S7)f r o mCsNADP-ME2 transgenic lines
and WT. In plants, the carbon skeleton required for amino
acid biosynthesis can be produced through the TCA cycle and
glycolysis (
Fig. 6A). It has been demonstrated that the level of
fructose-6-phosphate (F-6-P) phosphorylation [catalyzed by 6-
phosphofructokinase (PFK)] and PEP turnover regulate in vivo
glycolysis [36]. PEP can be converted into either pyruvate or
malate catalyzed by pyruvate kinase (PK) or PEPC (and subsequent
action of NADP-MDH), respectively . Malate and pyruvate may
both enter the TCA cycle, hence these intermediates and
their products, including malate, citrate, 2-oxoglutarate, and
glutamate, feedback-limit the enzymatic activities of PK and
PEPC. Therefore, in plants, the control of glycolysis comes
from the bottom up, with primary regulation at the level of
PEP metabolism by PK and PEPC and secondary regulation
being exerted by PEP at the conversion of F-6-P to fructose-
1,6-bisphosphate (F-1,6-BP) catalyzed by the ATP-dependent PFK
[
37].
Based on the above considerations, we next analyzed PEPC,
PK, and PFK enzyme activity and gene expression in exocarp

RNAi plants characterized by the downregulation of CsNADP-
ME2 expression and enzyme activity (Fig. 4A and E), the substrate
malate accumulated significantly (Fig. 6A). Accumulated malate
could feedback-inhibit the gene expressions and activities of PEPC
and PK (Fig. 6B–E), resulting in excess of substrate PEP . The gene
expression and activity of PFK (Fig. 6F and G) were subsequently
feedback-inhibited by accumulated PEP , which eventually sup-
pressed glycolysis. By contrast, due to the decrease in malate
content inCsNADP-ME2-OE lines (Fig. 6A), the increased transcript
levels and maintained enzyme activities of PEPC, PK, and PFK
(Fig. 6B–G) resulted in a continuous bottom-up feedback promo-
tion of glycolysis. These results indicated thatCsNADP-ME2 most
likely mediates the feedback regulation of the glycolytic pathway
in cucumber fruit.
In addition, the downregulation of CsNADP-ME2 in the fruit
of RNAi lines might slow down the rate of TCA cycle activity
as a result of the buildup of the TCA cycle substrate malate

(Figs 6A and 7). Some intermediates in the TCA cycle, such as
oxaloacetate (OAA) and 2-oxoglutarate (2OG), can be more effec-
tively employed as a precursor for the production of other deriva-
tives/amino acids, such as aspartic acid (Asp),γ-aminobutyric
acid (GABA) and proline (Pro) (Fig. 6A), thus promoting nitrogen
assimilation in the exocarp. However, inCsNADP-ME2-OE plants,
the intermediate products of the TCA cycle were probably used
mainly to produce energy and to maintain equilibrium reaction,
so the availability of carbon skeleton for amino acid metabolism
was limited in CsNADP-ME2-OE lines (
Fig. 7). Indeed, Asp, Pro,
glutamine (Gln), glutamic acid (Glu), and arginine (Arg) were
among the (derived) amino acids whose synthesis was remark-
ably reduced in the CsNADP-ME2-OE lines as contrasted with
WT (Fig. 6A). Overall, these results illustrate that manipulating
the expression of CsNADP-ME2 would most likely result in the
metabolic integration of the glycolytic pathway with the TCA cycle
as well as amino acid synthesis within the complex network of
primary metabolism in cucumber fruit (
Figs 6and 7).
Discussion
Cucumber fruits accumulate high activities of
decarboxylases
Cells surrounding the xylem of dicots like tobacco, celery , and
Arabidopsis [21, 24], as well as woody species [38] and monocots
such as rice [34], may take up and fix inorganic carbon sur-
rounding roots. For example, organic acids in the transpiration
stream might serve as a source of carbon, and release CO2 via
highly active decarboxylase [21, 24, 34, 38]. In the present study ,
considerable redistribution of radioactive carbon was detected
in sugars, amino acids, and organic acids in both green exocarp
and placenta tissues of cucumber fruits following the supply
of
14C-sodium bicarbonate to the root (Fig. 1A). Consistent with
these results, data on laser capture microdissection-derived RNA-
seq and RT–qPCR combined with enzyme assays revealed that
transcripts and activities of decarboxylases, including NADP-ME,
NAD-ME, and PEPCK, were also present in the vasculature of the
petiole, stem, and fruit of cucumber (
Supplementary Data Fig. S1;
Fig. 2)[ 32, 39]. Spatial positioning analysis further showed that
CsNADP-ME2 transcripts and proteins are highly expressed in
exocarp and vasculature in cucumber fruits (Fig. 3).
It has been reported thatcis-elements such as an ancient G-
box in the promoter, or those in untranslated regions (UTRs)
of decarboxylase genes, NADP-ME and NAD-ME, are sufficient
for bundle sheath (BS)-specific expression in either C4 plants
such as maize or mid-vein expression in C3 species such asAra-
bidopsis. These observations suggested a possible transcriptional
and/or post-transcriptional regulation of NADP-ME and NAD-
ME [21, 26, 40]. Similarly , prediction of theNADP-MDH promoter
region in sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) leaves indicated that there is

Figure 7.Putative model ofCsNADP-ME2 function in cucumber fruit.
Based on gene expression, tissue-specific localization, activity assay of
enzymes, and related physiological speculations, the role and active
sites of NADP-ME (one of the decarboxylases), the TCA cycle and
glycolysis in cucumber fruit are marked. Solid black arrows indicate
metabolic flux. Dotted black arrows indicate that the process consists of
multiple catalytic reactions. InCsNADP-ME2-OE plants (left) with
upregulation ofCsNADP-ME2 expression and enzyme activity (up arrow)
when compared with WT plants, the content of substrate malate
decreased (down arrows), then the increased transcript levels and
maintained enzyme activities of PK (the primary regulation) and PFK
(the secondary regulation) (up arrows) could result in a continuous
bottom-up feedback-promotion of glycolysis. On the other hand, as the
more intermediate products of the TCA cycle were likely used to
produce energy by its own reaction, the availability of carbon skeleton
for amino acid metabolism was suppressed. Compared with wild-type
plants, in RNAi plants (right) characterized by the downregulation of
CsNADP-ME2 expression and enzyme activity (down arrow), the
substrate malate accumulated significantly (up arrows). Accumulated
malate could feedback-inhibit the expressions and activities of PK and
PFK (down arrows). In addition, downregulation ofCsNADP-ME2 in the
fruit of RNAi lines might slow down the rate of TCA cycle activity due to
the accumulation of the substrate malate. Some intermediates in the
TCA cycle can be more effectively used as a precursor for the production
of other derivatives/amino acids, thus promoting nitrogen assimilation,
such as amino acid synthesis, in the exocarp. F-1,6-BP ,

transcriptional regulation related to mesophyll cell-specific
expression of NADP-MDH [41]. Upstream open reading frames
(uORFs) act as translational or post-transcriptional control
elements to regulate gene expression by modulating main open
reading frame (mORF) translation in the plant [42]. By affecting
translation initiation of the mORF and/or inducing nonsense-
mediated decay in a cis-acting manner [43], uORF-based gene
regulation has been demonstrated to play an important role in
plant metabolism [
43–46], such as conditioning the metabolism
of spermidine [ 44], phosphocholine [45], phosphate [43], and
ascorbate [ 46]. In Arabidopsis, a mitochondrial dicarboxylate
carrier (DIC1) is predicted to belong to the plant conserved
peptide uORF family , and functions as a malate/oxaloacetate
shuttle to provide other cellular compartments with reducing
equivalents [
47, 48]. In cucumber, we previously revealed that an
uORF in the 5′-UTR of CsHT1 mRNA, which encodes a pollen-
specific hexose transporter, may modulate the translation of
CsHT1 [49]. In the present study , we found that there was
indeed a certain number of uORFs in the predicted transcripts
of those family genes, e.g. one uORF in CsNADP-ME2, CsNAD-
ME2,a n dCsPEPCK1, two uORFs inCsNADP-ME1, and six uORFs
in CsPPDK (
Supplementary Data Table S1). uORFs are selected
during evolution and their regulatory activities are modulated by
varying environments and tissues to accelerate local adaptation,
domestication, and improvement in plants [42]. In this study , the
trend of both spatiotemporal expression and enzyme activity
seemed to be inconsistent between cucumber fruits and leaves
(
Fig. 2; Supplementary Data Fig. S3 ), indicating that these
enzymes in cucumber, especially decarboxylases, are most likely
under some certain degree of post-transcriptional or translational
regulation caused by uORF variations.
At the post-translational level, modifications of maize ZmC4-
NADP-ME at Ser419 (S419) altered enzymatic activity during
the day , which might coordinate the carbon concentration
mechanism with the rate of CO2 fixation [50]. Additionally , the
phosphorylation state of PEPCK in many plants modulates its
enzyme activities [
51–54]. Likewise, light intensity , the light/dark
transition, and high temperature can regulate pyruvate phos-
phate dikinase (PPDK) activity by modulating reversible phospho-
rylation [
55–57]. However, whether there is most likely extensive
(post-)transcriptional and/or (post-)translational regulation of
these enzymes, including three decarboxylases and PPDK in
cucumber fruits and leaves, remains to be further explored.
CsNADP-ME2 may play roles in balancing carbon
and nitrogen metabolism via continuous
bottom-up feedback regulation of glycolysis in
cucumber fruits
Plant NADP-ME is a key enzyme in malate metabolism [11]. Malate
partitioning is closely related to starch accumulation. In many
cases, malate and starch levels have a remarkable negative asso-
ciation [
13]. By manipulating the genes of malate metabolism
enzymes, for example, transgenic tomato green fruits with knock-
down of mitochondrial MDH with RNA interference technology
[
13] and transgenic potato plants with constitutive upregulation
of a physiologically active engineered PEPC [58] both saw a con-
siderable rise in the levels of malate but a remarkable drop in
soluble sugar and starch contents. Moreover, the downregulation
of either plastidic NADP-ME or cytosolic PEPCK resulted in a
decrease of starch content in tomato fruit at breaker stage [
59]. In
the present study , the malate content significantly decreased in
CsNADP-ME2-OE fruits, especially in the exocarp (Fig. 6A), while
the starch content dramatically increased (Fig. 4I). By contrast,
there was little change in starch following the increase of malate
content in CsNADP-ME2-RNAi fruit (Figs 4Iand 6A). Accordingly ,
similar to what happened in tomato fruit [59], we postulate that
the lower variation in starch metabolism caused by downregu-
lation of CsNADP-ME2 in cucumber fruit may not be related to
altered malate levels per se but potentially to altered redox status.
However, future research should be conducted to corroborate this
hypothesis.
In plants, the metabolism of carbon and nitrogen are inti-
mately intertwined [60]. In C4 plants, there is ample evidence of
an interaction between C4 pathways and the levels of nitrogen
[61, 62]. The mid-vein concentration of sugar and its deriva-

NADP-ME activity , with severe impacts on glycolytic intermedi-
ates, including glucose-6-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate,
10 | Horticulture Research, 2023, 10: uhad216
whereas abolishing the activity of NAD-ME, another biochemi-
cal subtype of decarboxylase, primarily influenced the levels of
glucosamine and amino acids in the mid-veins [21]. According to
metabolic profiling analysis of tomato fruits at the breaker stage,
inhibiting plastidic NADP-ME would increase some amino acids
in the pericarp tissues, such as aspartate, serine, and valine, as
well as sugars and their derivatives, likemyo-inositol and fructose
[
59]. In addition, amino acids were observed to be accumulated in
mutant NADP-ME1 loss-of-function embryos developed from aged
seeds inArabidopsis [20]. Hence, the effect of malate decarboxylase
on carbon and nitrogen metabolism probably depends on the
biological subtype of decarboxylase, the plant tissue, and the
developmental stage.
In cucumber, manipulating the expression ofCsNADP-ME2 had
significant effects on both sugar levels (Fig. 4) and amino acid
contents in fruits (Fig. 6), in general manifesting opposite trends
between the metabolism of nitrogen and C, in either OE plants or
RNAi lines (Fig. 6). These data illustrate that cucumberCsNADP-
ME2 is likely involved in the balance between the metabolism of
nitrogen and carbon by modulating the direction of carbon flow
in fruits, since malate provides a continuous bottom-up feed-
back regulation of PK- and PFK-mediated glycolysis, i.e. positive
feedback in CsNADP-ME2-OE plants and negative feedback in
CsNADP-ME2-RNAi lines (
Fig. 6). Therefore, based on gene expres-
sion analysis, tissue-specific localization and the metabolic and
molecular genetic tests presented in this report, we propose a
putative model ofCsNADP-ME2 function in cucumber fruit (Fig. 7).
We also hypothesize the potential role ofCsNADP-ME2 in the bal-
ance between the metabolism of nitrogen and carbon in cucum-
ber fruit, which involves coordination of several physiological
processes including glycolysis, amino acid metabolism, CO
2 fix-
ation, the TCA cycle, and photorespiration (Figs 6and 7).
Taken together, our data confirmed that CsNADP-ME2 cat-
alyzed malate decarboxylation to generate pyruvate and CO2
in the exocarp, main vascular bundle, and placental tissues of
cucumber fruit. In addition, the results provide new insight into
the role of a malate decarboxylase CsNADP-ME2 in regulating
the carbon flux into sugars/starch and amino acids in fruits of
cucumber. Complex processes may be implicated in reactions of
higher plants to the nitrogen–carbon balance, but the knowledge
gathered from this work offers novel insights into the molecular
genetics and metabolic alterations in nitrogen–carbon balance in
various plants.
Materials and methods
Plant materials, growth conditions, and
treatments
A phytotron under conditions that included a 10-h photoperiod
and a 25◦C/18◦C (day/night) temperature cycle was used to pre-
culture cucumber (C. sativus cv. ‘Xintaimici’) seedlings. Subse-
quently , 500μmol m−2 s−1 of photon flux density was used as
the light intensity . Three replicates of a randomized design were
used to position the seedlings in a solar greenhouse. Greenhouse
management followed the same schedule as that used by local
growers. Fruits from cucumbers were harvested at 2 days before
anthesis and 0, 3, 6, and 9 DAA. Cucumber leaves were collected
1 and 9 days after unfolding (DAU).
Extracting RNA and analysis with real-time
quantitative PCR
The Quick RNA isolation kit standard protocol (Huayueyang
Biotechnology Co. Ltd, Beijing, China) was followed for extracting
RNA. DNase was subsequently employed to eliminate any
remaining residue DNA from the isolated RNA. PowerScript™
Reverse Transcriptase (Tiangen Biotechnology Co. Ltd, Beijing,
China) was employed to create cDNA. The RT–PCR system (20μL)
contained 1μL of dNTP mixture (10 mM), 1μL of oligo dT primer
(2.5 μM), 2 μg of total RNA, and RNase-free ddH2Ot oav o l u m e
of 10μL. After denaturation at 65◦C for 5 min, 4μLo f5× reverse
transcriptase buffer, 0.5μL of RNase inhibitor (40 U/μL), 0.5μLo f
reverse transcriptase, and 5μL of RNase-Free ddH2O were added
in sequence. The reverse transcription program was as follows:
42◦C for 15 min, followed by 95◦C for 5 min.
RT–qPCR was conducted in an optical 96-well plate with a

reagent (TaKaRa, Beijing, China), 1μL cDNA, and 125 nM of each
gene-specific primer were used in the reactions, which had a
final volume of 20μL. Each set of cDNA samples and primer pairs
underwent three biological and three technical repetitions. The
data from the various tissues were then normalized depending
on the expression level of the constitutive β-tubulin (TUB)
genes.
Phylogenetic analysis
NADP-ME protein sequences used for phylogenetic trees were
downloaded from the TAIR database (
https://www.arabidopsis.
org/) and the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) (Supplementary Data Table
S3). By using the neighbor-joining method with 1000 replicates in
MEGA X [63], the full-length sequences of NADP-ME proteins were
compared to construct a phylogenetic tree. The photosynthetic
isoforms were named C
4(1)-NADP-ME and CAM1-NADP-ME, the
plastidic non-photosynthetic NADP-ME isoforms were named
C4(2)-NADP-ME and C3(2)-NADP-ME, while the non-photosynthetic
cytosolic isoforms were named C4(3)-NADP-ME, CAM2-NADP-ME,
and C3(1)-NADP-ME [15].
CsNADP-ME gene cloning and cucumber
transformation
A complete CsNADP-ME2 coding sequence was retrieved from
the Cucurbit Genomics Database (Cucumber Chinese Long
Genome v2, http://cucurbitgenomics.org/organism/2), followed
by the use of specific primers for the amplification of the
complementary DNA (cDNA) from the cucumber fruit (Supple-
mentary Data Table S2), and subsequent cloning into pGEM-
T Easy (TaKaRa, Beijing, China) vector. uORF prediction was
performed using the sequence structure (ATG-3n-TAG|TAA|TGA)
from 5′-UTRs of syntenic genes, which had lengths ranging from
30 to 1000 bases [49]. The uORF analysis of other genes related to
malate metabolism was similar.
For overexpression, the CsNADP-ME2 ORF was inserted into
the expression vector pBI121. Fragments of CsNADP-ME2 were
amplified with specific primers (Supplementary DataTable S2).
Using pFGC-1008, an RNA interference vector was created by con-
ventional techniques. Using the cotyledon transformation medi-
ated by Agrobacterium tumefaciens (LBA4404), these recombined
vectors were individually transformed into the cucumber cultivar
‘Xintaimici’ [
49]. The selection medium was used to screen trans-
genic lines, and their DNA and RNA contents were assessed via
PCR and RT–qPCR techniques.T2 transgenic lines were used for
further study .

Feeding of14C, imaging, and thin-layer
chromatography
Radiolabeling with 14C and autoradiography studies were car-
ried out according to previously reported methods [21, 24, 33].
The roots of hydroponically grown cucumbers were fed with
3.7 × 106 Bq NaH14CO3 solution for 2 h under light and left for 1 h
before sampling. Fruit for autoradiography was sectioned before
being flash-frozen at−80◦C and allowed 3 days of freeze-drying.
Once the tissue had dried, it was pressed flat and autoradio-
graphed for 14 days with Kodak BioMax MR-1 film (Rochester,
NY , USA).
The [U14C] malate feeding experiment was conducted as
described by Centeno,et al.[ 13] with minor modifications. A fresh
incubation medium (10 mM MES-KOH, pH 6.5) was used to wash
the cucumber exocarp, MVB, and placenta tissue three times
before being allowed to incubate [eight discs in 5 mL of incubation
medium containing [U
14C] malate (1.4 MBq mmol−1)] in malate
to a 10 mM final concentration. Following a 2-h incubation
period, samples were washed three times again in an unlabeled
incubation medium before being frozen in liquid nitrogen until
subsequent examination. A 100-mL sealed flask was used for
each incubation, which was conducted at 25
◦C under light with a
150-rpm shaker.
Extraction of soluble products was conducted as described
previously [21]. The samples were successively isolated in 80%
ethanol (v/v) at 70◦C for half an hour, 100% (v/v) acetone at 40◦C
for half an hour, and 80% (v/v) ethanol at 70◦C for half an hour in
sequence. A vacuum oven was used to dry down the supernatant,
followed by rehydration in ddH2O. Thereafter, using 20-cm long
silica plates (250μm, Silica Gel 60 A; Merck, Germany), TLC was
used to evaluate these samples. Organic acids were separated in
tert-butanol:acetone:ammonia:water (7:5:3:2 by volume) three
times as described by Brown et al.[ 21] . Carbohydrates were
separated in acetic acid:chloroform:water (7:6:1 by volume) three
times [64]. The plate with radiolabeled spots was exposed to
autoradiography film (Kodak Biome MR film, Rochester, NY , USA,
https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/catalog/product/sigma/z350400?
lang=zh&region=CN), and after scraping away the spots from the
plates, Ecoscint scintillation solution (National Diagnostics) was
used to count them. To identify the labeled compounds, parallel
plates containing standards of organic acids, amino acids, and
carbohydrates were run. Amino acids, carbohydrates, and organic
acids were observed with bromocresol green (NaOH adjusted),
50% (v/v) sulfuric acid, and ninhydrin solution, respectively [
21].
The percentages of radiolabeled amino acids, sugars, and organic
acids were expressed as the proportion of total material.
Enzymatic assays
The tissue of frozen leaves or fruits was extensively crushed under
liquid nitrogen. For NADP-ME extraction, the cucumber sample
was suspended thoroughly in an extraction buffer [10 mM 2-
mercaptoethanol, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 2 mM EDTA, 5 mM MgCl
2,a n d
100 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0)] [59]. The supernatants were obtained
after spinning at 13 000 g for 10 min to determine NADP-ME
activity in the reaction mix containing 10 mM malate, 0.5 nM
NADP, 10 mM MgCl2, and 50 mM Tris–HCl. The reaction was
initiated by adding malate [22]. Using a spectrophotometer (Unico
UV-2802PC, USA), activity was determined by tracking the rise in
NADPH absorbance at 340 nm.
Extraction and enzyme activity of PEPC, NAD-ME, and PPDK
were examined as indicated [65]. Monitoring NADH oxidation at
340 nm at room temperature allowed the measurement of PEPCK
activity in the carboxylation direction [
39]. NADP-malate dehydro-
genase (NADP-MDH) was extracted and the activity was measured
as described previously [66]. Spectrophotometric analysis was
used to assess the activities of PFK and PK as indicated in Liuet al.
[67]. The treated samples were incubated at 25◦Cf o r1 0m i na n d
the increase in absorbance at 340 nm was recorded for 10 min.
In situhybridization, western blot, and
immunolocalization localization
In situ hybridization (ISH) and immunolocalization localization
were conducted as outlined by Suiet al.[ 30] with minor changes.
To mount cross-sections on ProbeOn Plus Slides (Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Runcorn, UK) for ISH, they were cut to a thickness of
10 μm. The DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche, USA) was used to create
sense and antisense riboprobes for ISH byin vitro transcription
using the SP6 or T7 promoter from PCR products.
Supplemen-
tary Data Table S2gives a summary of the primer sequences. A
dot-blot test was used to determine the AgMaT1 probe’s selectiv-
ity . ISH was conducted as outlined by Jackson [
68]. Images were
captured with an Olympus BX53 microscope.
Rabbits were immunized by MBL Beijing Biotech Co. Ltd
(Beijing, China) using a specific peptide fragment (MESTLKEIGDG-
GSVLDLD) produced from the CsNADP-ME2 protein sequence.
Separation of samples was done by SDS–PAGE before blotting
them onto nitrocellulose and then treating them with an
anti-CsNADP-ME2 antibody for the western blot assay . After
washing several times, the membranes were incubated with
goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody–horseradish peroxidase conjugate
(Abmart, Shanghai, China). Proteins were visualized using
electrochemiluminescence (ECL) reagents (Millipore, USA). To
conduct immunolocalization, we blocked the cross-sections and
allowed them to incubate in the primary CsNADP-ME2 antibody
(diluted 1:500), followed by incubation with a 1:200 dilution of
secondary antibody (goat anti-rabbit AP or IgG–FITC labeling).
An Olympus BX53 microscope (AP labeling) or Olympus Fluoview
FV1000 confocal laser scanning microscope (FITC labeling) was
employed to capture the images with an excitation wavelength of
488 nm, and observations of chloroplast fluorescence were made
at a 546 nm wavelength.
Gas exchange
Gas exchange was performed according to a previous study [30].
With the aid of a plexiglass fruit chamber that was equipped
with a fan and a CO
2 gas sensor system (GXH-3052 L, Jun-Fang-
Li-Hua Technology Research Institute, Beijing, China), the rates
of CO2 evolution for whole fruits, peels, and slices without peels
were assessed in both the dark and light condition. To avoid
CO2 exchange at the tape–tissue interface, peels and slices were
applied to the wet plastic tape. Wound respiration of slices caused
by cutting was determined and corrected [
30]. Net photosynthesis
rate, and proportion of recaptured CO2 were analyzed according
to Suiet al.[ 30].
Metabolite profiling
Samples were ground to a fine powder, and 50 mg of ground
tissue from each independent pool was used for further
extraction. To conduct chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–
MS), metabolite extraction, derivatization, standard addition, and
sample injection were carried out as indicated by Schaueret al.
[
69]. TagFinder was utilized to assess chromatograms and mass
spectra [70].
Statistical analysis
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted to statistically
examine experimental data using SPSS software version 14.0.
