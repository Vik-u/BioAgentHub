Abstract 
Background: Malate is a C4‑dicarboxylic acid widely used as an acidulant in the food and beverage industry. Rational 
engineering has been performed in the past for the development of microbial strains capable of efficient production 
of this metabolite. However, as malate can be a precursor for specialty chemicals, such as 2,4‑dihydroxybutyric acid, 
that require additional cofactors NADP(H) and ATP , we set out to reengineer Escherichia coli for Krebs cycle‑dependent 
production of malic acid that can satisfy these requirements.
Results: We found that significant malate production required at least simultaneous deletion of all malic enzymes 
and dehydrogenases, and concomitant expression of a malate‑insensitive PEP carboxylase. Metabolic flux analysis 
using 13C‑labeled glucose indicated that malate‑producing strains had a very high flux over the glyoxylate shunt with 
almost no flux passing through the isocitrate dehydrogenase reaction. The highest malate yield of 0.82 mol/mol was 
obtained with E. coli Δmdh Δmqo ΔmaeAB ΔiclR ΔarcA which expressed malate‑insensitive PEP carboxylase  PpcK620S 
and NADH‑insensitive citrate synthase  GltAR164L. We also showed that inactivation of the dicarboxylic acid transporter 
DcuA strongly reduced malate production arguing for a pivotal role of this permease in malate export.
Conclusions: Since more NAD(P)H and ATP cofactors are generated in the Krebs cycle‑dependent malate produc‑
tion when compared to pathways which depend on the function of anaplerotic PEP carboxylase or PEP carboxykinase 
enzymes, the engineered strain developed in this study can serve as a platform to increase biosynthesis of malate‑
derived metabolites such as 2,4‑dihydroxybutyric acid.

Background
The four-carbon dicarboxylic acid malate is a Krebs cycle 
intermediate and a compound of considerable economic 
interest. It is mainly used as an acidulant in the food and 
beverage industry, or as a precursor for specialty chemi -
cals [1, 2].
Currently, d/l-malic acid is chemically produced by 
hydration of maleic anhydride and has an estimated 
annual market volume of ~ 10 kt/year. However, due to its 
potential to replace maleic acid as a major building block 
in the chemical industry, its annual production could 
rise to ~ 200 kt if a cost-efficient biochemical production 
process could be developed [ 2]. Therefore, malic acid has 
been ranked as one of the 12 top target molecules of bio -
chemical production processes [ 3], and much research 
effort has been invested in recent years to optimize the 
metabolic network and cultivation conditions of malate-
producing organisms.
The filamentous fungus Aspergillus flavus  was the first 
identified natural malate-producing organism [ 4]. After 
optimization of cultivation conditions, it accumulated 
113 g/l malate with a yield and productivity of 1.26 mol/
mol and 0.59  g/(lh), respectively [ 5]. However, since A. 
flavus produces toxic aflatoxin, this organism was never 
employed in industrial production processes. Dur -

organisms, the yeast Zygosaccharomyces rouxii  and the 
filamentous fungi Aspergillus oryzae  and Penicillium

sclerotiorum were shown to accumulate malate to high 
levels, reaching 92 g/l at a yield of 1.2 mol/mol for the lat-
ter organism [6–8].
In complementary studies carried out in yeast, bac -
teria, and fungi, it was tried to further increase malate 
production by rational optimization of the metabolic 
network. The oxaloacetate (OAA)-yielding carboxyla
-
tion of either phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) or pyruvate, 
followed by direct reduction of OAA to produce malate 
represents the most efficient metabolic pathway, which 
has a theoretical yield of 2  mol malate per mol glucose 
[9]. Therefore, all metabolic engineering endeavors to 
increase malate production focused on the optimiza
-
tion of this pathway. The overexpression of pyruvate car -
boxylase, malate dehydrogenase, and malate permease 
activities in a pyruvate-overproducing Saccharomyces 
cerevisiae platform strain enabled the accumulation of 
59 g/l malate at a yield of 0.42 mol/mol [9–11]. Using a 
similar strategy, malate production by an A. oryzae strain 
could be increased to 154  g/l and a yield of 1.38  mol/
mol after overexpressing pyruvate carboxylase, and a 
malate permease [6]. While the optimal function of the 
processes employing yeast and fungi required aerobic 
cultivation conditions, anaerobic malate production 
was demonstrated with Escherichia coli. A strain devoid 
of all alternative fermentative pathways and evolved for 
the production of succinate [12, 13] was converted into a 
malate producer by additionally deleting the genes cod
-
ing for malic enzyme, fumarate reductase and fumarase 
activities. The strain accumulated 34  g/l malate with a 
yield and productivity of 1.42  mol/mol and 0.47  g/(l  h), 
respectively [14]. Malate and succinate production in 
the evolved strain relied on mutations that conferred 
increased expression of PEP carboxykinase (Pck) and 
inactivation of the PTS sugar uptake system [15, 16]. 
Together, these modifications enabled an ATP-producing 
carboxylation of PEP and thus increases the energy out
-
put of the pathway. The microbial production of malic 
acid by the use of additional microorganisms and alter
-
native substrates was discussed in detail in two recent 
reviews [17, 18].
The biosynthesis of malate from glucose via direct 
reduction of oxaloacetate is redox neutral and produces a 
maximum of two mole ATP per glucose molecule if PEP 
is converted into oxaloacetate via the ATP-forming Pck. 
Thus, in biosyntheses that employ additional reduction 
steps for the conversion of malate into other target mol
-
ecules, cofactor supply may become limiting. We recently 
proposed a synthetic pathway which converts malate 
into DHB requiring one mol of ATP and two moles of 
NAD(P)H [19]. These additional cofactors cannot be pro
-
duced by employing the above-cited conventional path -
ways for malate biosynthesis. Therefore, we set out to 
investigate metabolic engineering requirements to enable 
aerobic malate production via Krebs cycle and glyoxylate 
shunt, which increases ATP and NADH production at 
the expense of a decreased maximum malate yield which 
drops to 1.33 mol/mol [9].
We show that significant malate production through 
the Krebs cycle could not be achieved by solely deleting 
all malate dehydrogenases and malic enzymes, but addi
-
tionally required the over-expression of a malate-insen -
sitive PEP carboxylase mutant. Malate production was 
further increased by the inactivation of the acetate path
-
ways, or by the overexpression of a NADH-insensitive 
citrate synthase mutant. Inactivation of the dicarboxylic 
acid transporter DcuA strongly reduced malate produc
-
tion arguing for a pivotal role of this permease in malate 
export. The best strain produced malate from glucose at a 
yield of 0.82 mol/mol.

was adjusted to pH 7 and filter-sterilized. Pre-cultures 
were inoculated at OD of ~ 0.5 from starter cultures that 
were grown overnight in LB. Growth cultures were inoc

ulated at OD of ~ 0.2 from exponentially growing pre-
cultures. When OD of the growth cultures reached 0.6, 
1 mM isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was 
added. Strains were incubated in 250  ml flasks contain

single deletions were recovered from the Keio collec -
tion [51]. Phage lysates of single deletion mutants were 
prepared by inoculating 10 ml of LB medium containing 
50 µg/ml kanamycin, 2 g/l glucose, and 5 mM  CaCl
2 with 
100 µl of overnight precultures. Following an incubation 
of 1 h at 37 °C, 200 µl of phage lysate prepared from the 
wild-type E. coli K-12 MG1655 strain were added, and 
cultures were incubated for another 2–3 h until cell lysis 
had completed. After addition of 200 µl chloroform, cell 
preparations were first vigorously vortexed and then cen

trifuged for 10 min at 4500×g. The clear lysate was recov-
ered and stored at 4 °C. The receptor strain was prepared 
for phage transduction by an overnight cultivation at 
37 °C in LB medium. A volume of 1.5 ml of the precul

ture was centrifuged at 1500×g for 10 min. The superna -
tant was discarded and the cell pellet was resuspended in 
600 µl of a solution containing 10 mM  MgSO
4 and 5 mM 
 CaCl2. The transduction was carried out by mixing 100 µl 
of the solution containing the receptor strain with 100 µl 
of lysate and incubating this mixture at 30 °C for 30 min. 
Thereafter, 100 µl of a 1 M sodium citrate solution were 
added followed by vigorous vortexing. After addition of 
1  ml LB medium, the cell suspension was incubated at 
37 °C for 1 h before spreading the cells on LB agar dishes 
containing 50  µg/ml kanamycin. Clones able to grow in 
presence of the antibiotic were confirmed by colony PCR 
to contain the desired deletion using the primers listed 
in Table 3. The resistance gene (FRT-kan-FRT) was sub

sequently excised from the chromosome using the FLP 
recombinase-harbouring plasmid pCP20 [52] leaving a 
scar region containing one FRT site. Kanamycin resistant 
mutants were transformed with pCP20, and ampicillin-
resistant transformants were selected at 30  °C. Trans

formants were then grown on solid LB medium at 37 °C 
and tested for loss of all antibiotic resistances. Excision of 
the FRT-kanamycin cassette was analyzed by colony PCR 
using crimson taq polymerase and the flanking locus-
specific primers (Table  1). All strains used in this study 
are listed in Table 2.

Analytical techniques
Glucose and extracellular metabolites were quantified 
on a Dionex Ultimate 3000 HPLC system equipped 
with a UV and an RI (Shimadzu RID 10A) detector, an 
Aminex HPX-87H column thermostated at 32 °C, and 
a “Micro-Guard cation H Refill Cartridge” pre-column. 
Dilute sulfuric acid (1.25 mM) was used as the mobile 
phase at an isocratic flow rate of 0.5 ml/min.

bioreactors off-gas were measured on-line using a Mass 
Gas Analyzer.
Quantification of extracellular metabolites
Culture broth was separated from cells by centrifuga -
tion over 0.45  µm pore size membranes (Minisart, Sar -
torius) and stored at − 20  °C until analysis. To quantify 
secreted metabolites, clear supernatant was subject to 
1H 1D-NMR analysis (Avance 800  MHz spectrometer, 
Bruker, Germany) carried out at 292 °K, using a 30° pulse 
and a relaxation delay of 20 s. Trimethylsilyl propionate 
was used as internal standard.
Quantification of mass isotopologues in intracellular 
metabolites
Approximately 0.8 ml samples (cells + culture medium) 
with a cell concentration of 0.4 g/l were manually with -
drawn from the bioreactor and directly quenched and 
extracted by mixing with 3  ml of a mixture of ace -
tonitrile, methanol, and formic acid (0.1  M) (40:40:20 
v/v), and incubation at − 20 °C for 1 h. Next, the tubes 
were moved to −  80  °C until further treatment. Sam

ple evaporation was performed in a rotavapor (Büchi, 
Switzerland) during approximately 15 h until complete 
dryness. Afterwards, the samples were dissolved in a

ysis. IC-MS/MS analysis was carried out as described 
by [34] to quantify the isotopic enrichment of selected 
metabolites. The analyzed metabolites were PEP , R5P , 
S7P , 6PG, G6P , FBP , F6P , 23 PG, Cit, Fum, Mal and Suc. 
Raw peak areas were corrected for the contribution of 
all naturally abundant isotopes using the IsoCor soft

ware [53]. In addition, label incorporation into secreted 
acetate and malate was measured using 1H 1D-NMR as 
described above.
Calculation of fluxes
Intracellular carbon fluxes were calculated from data 
on mass isotopologue enrichments and production/
consumption rates of extracellular metabolites using 
the Influx_s software [21].
Results
Efficient malate production requires inactivation of malic 
enzymes and dehydrogenases, and appropriate expression 
of malate‑insensitive PEP carboxylase
To investigate the Krebs cycle-dependent malate produc-
tion, we step-wise introduced deletions in competing 
metabolic pathways (Fig.  1) and analyzed the behavior 
of the mutants in shake flask cultures using M9 min -
eral medium which contained 10  g/l glucose as a car -
bon source. To trigger malate secretion under aerobic 
conditions we first interrupted the Krebs cycle by delet
-
ing the soluble and membrane associated malate dehy -
drogenases, encoded by mdh  and mqo, respectively [20, 
21]. However, no significant malate accumulation in the 
culture medium was observed in the single and dou
-
ble mutants but acetate production strongly increased 
(Table 1). We therefore additionally deleted the acetate-
forming pathway, encoded by ackA-pta [22], and the two 
malic enzymes, encoded by maeA and maeB. The result

ing quintuple mutant Sy162 produced malate at a molar 
yield of 0.12 (Table 3).
It was previously demonstrated that the aerobic pro

duction of the Krebs cycle intermediates succinate and 
fumarate could be improved by increasing expression 
of the anaplerotic enzymes phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) 
carboxylase (Ppc) [23, 24], or pyruvate carboxylase [25]. 
However, overexpression of the natural Ppc from E. 
coli did not increase malate production (Table  1). We 
therefore hypothesized that intracellular accumulation

of malate inhibits Ppc [26], thereby preventing produc -
tion of oxaloacetate and thus synthesis of the first Krebs 
cycle intermediate citrate. We alleviated malate feed -
back inhibition by introducing mutation Lys620Ser into 
the Ppc enzyme [27] and varied the expression level of 
the resulting mutant using the high and medium copy 
plasmids, pEXT20 and pACT3 [28], respectively, and 
strong and weak ribosome binging sites (RBS). Indeed, 
we found that the expression of the  Ppc
K620S mutant 
strongly improved malate production, and that malate 
yield varied by more than threefold depending on the 
choice of the expression vector and strength of the RBS. 
Our data does not provide a clear explanation for the 
observed differences in the production of malate and 
other metabolic by-products, since they can be due to 
changes in the activity of the  Ppc
K620S enzyme or due to 
the altered metabolic burden imposed by different plas -
mid copy numbers. However, it was previously dem -
onstrated by Lee et al. [29] that efficient production of 
threonine required moderate over-expression of Ppc 
and that an excessively high Ppc activity was deleteri
-
ous for the production of this amino acid. In line with 
these results, we found that the medium-copy plasmid 
pACT3w-ppc
K620S, which contained a weak RBS and 
which can therefore be considered the weakest expres -
sion system of the four tested vectors, produced the 
highest malate yield of 0.48  mol/mol (Table  1). Plas
-
mid pACT3w-ppc K620S was therefore used in all further 
experiments (Table 4 ).
We then tested the impact of expressing the malate-
insensitive  PpcK620S mutant in strains that were still 
wild-type for at least one malic enzyme, or that still 
contained the functional AckA-Pta-dependent acetate 
pathway. We found that malate yields strongly decreased 
in strains expressing at least one malic enzyme and did 
not exceed 0.15  mol/mol (Additional file  1: Table  S1), 
whereas the presence of the AckA-Pta pathway only had 
a minor impact on the malate yield which was estimated 
at 0.4  mol/mol (Table  2). Taken together these results 
show that inactivation of all malate dehydrogenases and 
malic enzymes together with appropriate expression of 
a malate insensitive Ppc mutant are necessary and suffi
-
cient to enable significant malate production.
Characterization of carbon flux distribution 
in a malate‑producing strain and further genotype 
optimization
After having identified the major requirements for aero -
bic malate production in E. coli, we carried out a detailed 
analysis on the impact of additional genetic modifica -
tions on malate production by this organism. Starting 
from strain Sy502, which carried deletions in both malate 
dehydrogenases and malic enzymes (Δmdh Δmqo ΔmaeA 
ΔmaeB) and which had a malate yield of 0.4 mol/mol, we 
sequentially deleted the transcriptional repressor of the 
glyoxylate shunt genes (aceA, aceB), encoded by iclR [30, 
31], and the enzymes acetate kinase and pyruvate oxi
-
dase, encoded by ackA [32] and poxB [33], respectively. 
We observed that the transcriptional derepression of the 
glyoxylate pathway upon deletion of iclR in strain Sy502 
giving rise to strain Sy504 did not result in an increased 
malate yield. In addition, acetate production remained 
unchanged when compared to strain Sy502 (Table  2), 
which is at variance to the behavior of an ΔiclR single 
mutant that is known to have reduced acetate formation 
[34]. Nevertheless, we continued to work with strains 
that carried an iclR deletion to assure complete derepres
-
sion of the glyoxylate shunt. Deletion of ackA (Sy510) 
increased malate production by 24% and decreased ace
-
tate (Table  2). Deleting poxB alone (Sy508) or together 
with ackA (Sy512) strongly reduced acetate production, 
but also resulted in an up to 50% drop of malate produc -
tion compared to strain Sy510, which was mainly due to 
an augmented production of pyruvate (Table  2). These 
results showed that the major metabolic by-product 
acetate could not be channeled into the Krebs cycle by 
simply deleting the ackA and poxB-dependent acetate 
pathways. In addition, the strains that carried the ackA

deletion alone or in combination with a deletion of poxB 
(Sy510, Sy512) exhibited strongly extended lag phases 
(not shown) which was in agreement with previous stud
-
ies [35, 36]. The strategy of increasing malate production 
by directly engineering the acetate pathways was there -
fore dismissed.
To identify alternative metabolic targets to increase 
malate production without deleting the acetate pathways 
we carried out a carbon flux analysis on strain Sy504. The 
strain was cultivated on 
13C-labelled glucose in a biore -
actor where glucose consumption and the formation of 
the metabolic end-products biomass, carbon dioxide, 
and organic acids were monitored. Samples for the quan
-
tification of 13C-label enrichment in individual metabo -
lite pools were withdrawn manually during exponential 
phase and quantified by IC-MS/MS analysis [37]. In addi
-
tion, the label incorporation into acetate and malate was 
measured using 
1H 1D-NMR.
The carbon flux distribution in strain Sy504 was calcu -
lated from these data and is depicted in Fig.  2. In qualita-
tive agreement to the shake flask experiments we found 
that malate and fumarate were co-secreted into the 
supernatant and that acetate was the major metabolic 
by-product in addition to the two C4 compounds. Unex
-
pectedly, we calculated a direct flux from oxaloacetate 
towards malate of ~ 8 mol%. This result is hard to explain 
considering that (i) under aerobic conditions this flux 
normally occurs in the opposite direction, and (ii) malate 
dehydrogenase was deleted in the analysed strain. A pos
-
sible explanation for this putative flux is that carbon flux 
actually passed from oxaloacetate to fumarate and fur
-
ther to malate through aspartate transaminase, aspartase, 
and fumarase, respectively.
As expected, strong differences in carbon flux repar
-
titioning between wild-type strains [34, 38, 39] and the 
malate-producing strain Sy504 have been observed 
regarding the metabolic fate of PEP and the solicitation 
of the Krebs cycle and glyoxylate shunt reactions. Since 
oxaloacetate cannot be regenerated from malate in strain 
Sy504, the net-flux from PEP to oxaloacetate, that is, the 
flux over PEP carboxylase minus the flux over PEP car
-
boxykinase, is on average 60% higher in this mutant than 
in the corresponding E. coli MG1655 wild-type strains 
(Additional file 1: Table S2).
While the flux from pyruvate to acetyl-CoA remained 
largely the same in all strains, acetyl-CoA was utilized 
very differently in our strain when compared to wild-type 
cells. Sy504 produced nearly 50% less acetate, and con
-
densed a particularly large fraction of 30  mol% acetyl-
CoA with glyoxylate to yield malate. Even in an ΔiclR 
single mutant, which has a derepressed glyoxylate shunt 
[34], nearly two-times less acetyl-CoA is directly con
-
verted into malate which indicates a particularly strong 
solicitation of the glyoxylate shunt in the malate-produc
-
ing strain. The split ratio of fluxes at the isocitrate lyase 
(Icl)–isocitrate dehydrogenase (Icd) bifurcation was 5 in 
strain Sy504 (Additional file  1: Table S2), whereas it was 
only 0.5 in the ΔiclR mutant [34] during growth on glu
-
cose, and 0.4 during growth of wild type cells on acetate 
[40]. Even more strikingly, no carbon flux was observed 
between 2-oxoglutarate and succinate in our malate-
producing strain (Fig.  2). Our study did not identify the 
actual physiological reason for this unexpected behav
-
iour. However, since high flux across the glyoxylate shunt 
is required to attain the maximum theoretical malate 
yield of 1.33  mol/mol with the this pathway [9], this 
result of the flux analysis made clear that malate produc
-
tion could not be significantly increased by engineering 
the Icl/Icd node.
Instead, our attention was attracted by the observa
-
tion that strain Sy504 produced 50% less acetate and 20% 
more malate in the bioreactor when compared to shake 
flask cultivations (Table  1, Fig.  2). We hypothesized that 
better aeration of the fermenter cultures could explain 
increased malate production in the bioreactor. Oxygen 
limitation is known to cause both ArcA-mediated repres
-
sion of genes implicated in respiratory metabolism and 
accumulation of NADH [41]. We therefore tested the 
effect of deleting the transcriptional repressor ArcA, 
and of overexpressing the NADH-insensitive citrate 
synthase mutant  GltA
R164L [42]. We found that the dele -
tion of arcA in strain Sy729 which bears the iclR dele -
tion increased the malate yield to 0.53 mol/mol (Table 2). 
The additional overexpression of  GltAR164L in strain 
Sy731 resulted in a further improved malate yield which 
amounted to 0.82 mol/mol. It is of note that this increase 
of malate yield with strain Sy731 was accompanied by a 
strongly reduced acetate production which dropped to 
only 0.28 mol/mol without requiring the deletion of any 
of the acetate-producing pathways. The additional dele
-
tion of aspartase, encoded by aspA, did not increase 
malate production (not shown).

The dicarboxylic acid transporter DcuA is the major 
malate‑exporting permease in the engineered strain
Previous studies have shown that malate production 
could be strongly increased by overexpressing malate-
exporting permeases [6, 9]. Alternatively, the deletion 
of malate permease(s) increases intracellular availability 
of malate which can be expected to be beneficial for the 
conversion of malate into other value-added products, 
such as 2,4-dihydroxybutyric acid [19]. We therefore 
set out to identify the malate transporter in the malate-
producing strain E. coli Δmdh Δmqo ΔackA-pta ΔmaeA 
ΔmaeB pACT3w-ppc
K620S (Sy280) by deleting the per -
mease DctA, which is required for the uptake of dicarbo -
xylic acids aerobic conditions [43, 44], and the permeases 
DcuA and DcuB which are responsible for the uptake of 
dicarboxylic acids under anaerobic conditions [45]. In 
addition, we tested the impact of deleting two putative 
transporter proteins, YeeE and YqhC [46], which were 
found transcriptionally up-regulated in our malate-pro
-
ducing strain (data not shown). We observed that malate 
and fumarate secretion decreased by ~ 80% upon deletion 
of the constitutively expressed dicarboxylic acid trans
-
porter, DcuA [47], whereas the deletion of the other per -
meases did not cause any decrease of malate secretion. 
Thus, DcuA was identified as the major malate-exporting 
permease under aerobic conditions (Fig.  3). However, 
plasmid-born overexpression of this transporter did not 
increase malate production (data not shown).
Discussion
In the present study we investigated the metabolic 
requirements for Krebs cycle-dependent production of 
malic acid in E. coli. We found that significant malate 
production under these conditions required deletion of 
all malic enzymes and dehydrogenases, and concomi
-
tant expression of a malate-insensitive PEP carboxylase. 
Interestingly, there was almost no gradual increase of 
malate production upon step-wise introduction of these 
metabolic modifications, but all genetic modifications 
had to be present simultaneously to trigger malate pro
-
duction. These results appear to be at variance with data 
of [48] who reported aerobic production of malate at a 
yield of 0.56 mol/mol upon expression of a PEP carbox
-
ykinase (Pck) from Mannheimia succiniciproducens in 
an E. coli pta mutant. It is not clear to us how aerobic 
malate production could be achieved in this metabolic 
set-up given that (i) reduction of oxaloacetate (OAA) to 
malate requires high NADH/NAD ratios which are com
-
monly only achieved under oxygen-limited or anaerobic 
conditions in E. coli, (ii) Pck-dependent synthesis of OAA 
from PEP requires high carbon dioxide and PEP concen
-
trations [11], which are commonly achieved by imposing 
either anaerobic conditions or sparging with carbon diox-
ide [11, 15] and by deleting the PEP-consuming phospho-
transferase system or inactivating pyruvate kinase [11, 15, 
16]. In addition, (iii) our own results show in agreement 
with the observations made by Zhang et  al. [14] that 
activity of the malic enzymes prevents significant malate 
accumulation (Additional file  1: Table  S2). The actual 
reason for these apparent discrepancies remains unclear 
which may indicate our still incomplete understanding 
of the metabolic regulation that occurs at the PEP/OAA/
malate/pyruvate node in E. coli.
The major metabolic by-product in our aerobic meta
-
bolic setup was acetate. Our attempts to reduce acetate 
secretion by deleting the AckA and/or PoxB-dependent 
pathways came at the cost of extended lag-phases or even 
reduced malate production. We therefore set out to engi
-
neer strains that produced less acetate despite having 
functional acetate pathways. Acetate production is mainly 
regulated by citrate synthase activity. Citrate synthase 
is allosterically inhibited by high intracellular NADH 
concentrations, and excess acetyl-CoA is converted to 
acetate instead of being condensed with oxaloacetate to 
enter the Krebs cycle in the form of citrate [42, 49, 50]. 
In agreement with this notion, the deletion of the tran
-
scriptional repressor of respiratory enzymes, ArcA, and 
the overexpression of NADH-insensitive citrate synthase 
reduced acetate formation by 50% and increased malate 
production by ~ 90% (when comparing strains Sy504 and 
Sy731). Together, these results indicated that reducing 
acetate production via engineering NADH metabolism 
and citrate synthase was an effective means to improve 
the performance of malate-producing strains.

We found that malate production by our strains coin -
cided with the accumulation of significant amounts of 
fumarate. Both compounds accumulated in the super -
natant at a molar ratio of approximately 8, which is very 
similar to the ratio of their intracellular concentrations 
that was estimated with approximately 12 [51]. Thus, 
because the malate/fumarate ratio is imposed by the 
thermodynamic equilibrium of the reversible fumarase 
reaction, Krebs cycle-dependent malate production will 
almost inevitably coincide with the formation of fuma
-
rate as a co-product. In line with these arguments, we 
found that the dicarboxylic acid transporter DcuA, which 
accepts both malate and fumarate as substrates [45], was 
responsible for malate secretion. Only replacement of 
this rather unspecific permease by a highly malate-spe
-
cific transporter could reduce fumarate secretion during 
Krebs cycle-dependent malate production.
In summary, Krebs-cycle dependent malate produc
-
tion can be achieved at the cost of lower maximum 
product yields and significant accumulation of fuma
-
rate as a metabolic by-product. These results make 
this metabolic engineering strategy unattractive when 
compared to Ppc or Pck-dependent pathways if malate 
is the actual target molecule. However, if malate is an 
intermediate product which is further processed to 
yield derivatives such as DHB [19], fumarate will not 
accumulate and the additional cofactors NAD(P)H and 
ATP which are generated in the Krebs cycle and res
-
piratory chain can be used to increase product yields. 
Our study has laid the foundation for these microbial 
product syntheses.
Our study was carried out in aerobic shake flasks on 
mineral M9 medium. These cultivation conditions are 
clearly not representative for a fermentation process 
which enables cost efficient production of malate which 
would require to carry out the fermentations in biore
-
actors using low-cost mineral salt medium [52]. Under 
such conditions, product titers and yields obtained with 
the strains described in this work may significantly 
change. However, at the present stage of our analyses 
we focused on the fundamental genetic requirements 
for Krebs cycle-dependent malate production, which 
represents an intermediate stage on the way to the 
construction of production strains for biosynthesis of 
malate-derived value-added chemicals such as DHB.
