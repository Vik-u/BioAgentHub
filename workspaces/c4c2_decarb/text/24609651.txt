Abstract
C4 photosynthesis has higher light-use, nitrogen-use, and water-use efficiencies than C3 photosynthesis. Historically, 
most of C4 plants were classified into three subtypes (NADP-malic enzyme (ME), NAD-ME, or phosphoenolpyruvate 
carboxykinase (PEPCK) subtypes) according to their major decarboxylation enzyme. However, a wealth of historic 
and recent data indicates that flexibility exists between different decarboxylation pathways in many C 4 species, and 
this flexibility might be controlled by developmental and environmental cues. This work used systems modelling to 
theoretically explore the significance of flexibility in decarboxylation mechanisms and transfer acids utilization. The 
results indicate that employing mixed C
4 pathways, either the NADP-ME type with the PEPCK type or the NAD-ME type 
with the PEPCK type, effectively decreases the need to maintain high concentrations and concentration gradients of 
transport metabolites. Further, maintaining a mixture of C4 pathways robustly affords high photosynthetic efficiency 
under a broad range of light regimes. A pure PEPCK-type C 4 photosynthesis is not beneficial because the energy 
requirements in bundle sheath cells cannot be fulfilled due to them being shaded by mesophyll cells. Therefore, only 
two C
4 subtypes should be considered as distinct subtypes, the NADP-ME type and NAD-ME types, which both inher-
ently involve a supplementary PEPCK cycle.
Key words: Efficiency, flexibility, mixture, NADP-ME, NAD-ME, PEPCK.
Introduction
Plants using C 4 photosynthesis have higher potential 
energy-conversion efficiency than C 3 plants because of a 
CO2-concentrating mechanism that largely reduces pho-
torespiration (Zhu et  al., 2008; Amthor, 2010). In most 
cases, with the exception of single-cell C 4 photosynthesis 
(Edwards et al., 2004), this CO 2-concentrating mechanism 
usually requires compartmentalized photosynthetic reac-
tions into two distinct cell types: bundle sheath cells (BSCs) 
and mesophyll cells (MCs) (Hatch, 1987). In C
4 plants, CO2 
is fixed by phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylase (PEPC) 
in the MC cytosol, and the resulting C
4 acid is subsequently 
converted to either malate or aspartate. Then, the C 4 acid 
is transported to the BSCs where it is decarboxylated to 
release CO
2 around Rubisco. Decarboxylation in BSCs, 
together with the CO 2 diffusion barrier between BSCs 
and MCs, elevates the CO 2 concentration around Rubisco, 
thereby minimizing photorespiration (von Caemmerer and 
Furbank, 2003).

Traditionally, C4 photosynthesis is classified into three bio-
chemical subtypes, according to their different decarboxyla-
tion mechanisms. The first enzyme of the C 4 cycle, PEPC, is 
common to all three subtypes. The product of PEPC, oxaloac-
etate (OAA), can be either reduced to malate by malate 
dehydrogenase (MDH) or converted to aspartate (Asp) by 
aspartate aminotransferase (Hatch and Slack, 1966; Hatch 
et al., 1975; Pick et al., 2011). Malate is then transported to 
BSCs in NADP-malic enzyme (ME) subtype plants while 
Asp is transported in NAD-ME and PEPCK types (Hatch 
et al., 1975; Kanai and Edwards, 1999; Furbank, 2011). In the 
NADP-ME type, malate is used to generate pyruvate and CO
2, 
with the formation of NADPH catalysed by NADP-ME. In 
the other two decarboxylation types, aspartate is converted 
back to OAA in BS cytosol or mitochondria (Taniguchi et al., 
1995). In the NAD-ME type, OAA is reduced to malate by 
MDH, and the NAD-ME then catalyses splitting of malate 
to release CO
2 and pyruvate in mitochondria. In the PEP-
carboxykinase (PEPCK) type, most of the OAA is converted 
to PEP and CO
2 in BSC cytosol by PEPCK. NAD-ME is 
used to provide NADH for generation of ATP, which can be 
used to fuel PEPCK (Kanai and Edwards, 1999). NAD-ME 
can also balance the amino groups between MCs and BSCs 
via the return of alanine to MCs (Furbank, 2011). Since Asp 
brings an amino group from MCs to BSCs, OAA generated 
from Asp can be utilized in two ways. One is that PEPCK 
generates PEP, which directly returns to MCs without an 
amino group; the other is that OAA is converted to malate, 
which is then decarboxylated to pyruvate by NAD-ME. The 
resulting pyruvate can be converted to alanine and returned 
to MCs, thereby transporting the amino group.
Although C
4 photosynthesis has long been classified into 
three distinct subtypes, multiple lines of evidence suggest 
that some flexibility in C
4 photosynthetic pathways exists in 
the same leaf: specifically that NADP-ME and PEPCK sub-
types might coexist; similarly, NAD-ME type and PEPCK 
subtypes can also coexist. Early 
14C-labelling experiments in 
maize indicated that radioactively labelled carbon provided 
as CO
2 is mostly incorporated into malate, but also to a sub-
stantial degree into aspartate, a compound normally consid-
ered as not present in the classical NADP-ME-type model 
(Hatch, 1971). Later, Chapman and Hatch (1981) showed 
that isolated BSCs of maize can use aspartate and oxoglutar-
ate to produce CO
2 and Pick et al. (2011) showed that maize 
leaves contain sufficient activities of the aminotransferases to 
carry the required flux. Furthermore, a similar phenomenon 
has also been found in Flaveria bidentis, an NADP-ME dicot 
species (Meister et al., 1996). Key C
4 enzyme activities also 
indicate that the ratio of asparate to malate transferred var -
ies in NADP-ME type species (Kanai and Edwards, 1999). 
The flexibility of C
4 subtypes has also been shown through 
coexistence of key enzymes. For example, in maize, PEPCK 
is present, active, and capable of supporting high rates of 
aspartate-dependent photosynthesis in isolated BSCs (Walker 
et al., 1997; Wingler et al., 1999; Majeran et al., 2010; Pick 
et al., 2011). The PEPCK transcript is expressed at high lev-
els in maize BSCs (Furumoto et al., 1999, 2000). Also in the 
NAD-ME species Cleome gynandra, high PEPCK activity 
was detected (Sommer et  al., 2012) and different C
4 dicots 
also contain PEPCK in addition to the major decarboxyla-
tion enzyme (Muhaidat et al., 2007; Muhaidat and McKown, 
2013).
The flexibility or coexistence of different C
4 subtypes, 
i.e. between NADP-ME and PEPCK subtypes, or between 
NAD-ME and PEPCK subtypes, is also reflected in the 
theoretical quantum yield and observed energy-conversion 
efficiencies between plants considered having different sub-
types. Theoretical considerations on quantum yield and 
leakiness of CO
2 from BSCs suggested that the efficiency of 
C4 subtypes should be different and that the PEPCK subtype 
has the highest energy-conversion efficiency (Hatch, 1995; 
von Caemmerer and Furbank, 1999; von Caemmerer and 
Furbank, 2003). However, experimental evidence for this is 
still insufficient (Ghannoum et al., 2001; Furbank, 2011).
Considering these facts, it is highly likely that the so-
called C
4 subtypes actually coexist in C 4 plants. So far, the 
physiological significance of this potential coexistence of C 4 
subtypes is inadequately studied. This study uses a systems 
modelling approach to theoretically evaluate the potential 
physiological consequences of having different mixtures of 
C
4 subtypes and further discusses whether the PEPCK path-
way should indeed be considered as an independent or as a 
supplementary pathway.
Materials and methods
Model development
The models developed here are depicted diagrammatically in Fig. 1. 
The individual models were developed following the basic procedure 
as in Zhu et al. (2007). Essentially, after the reaction diagrams were 
established, differential equations, rate equations, and algebraic 
equations representing conserved quantities were developed. The 
models were implemented in MATLAB and solved using ode15s.
With the models, this work computed changes in the metabolite 
concentrations (dM/dt) by the differences between rates of fluxes 
generating and consuming this metabolite:
 
dM
dt vvin out=−  (1)
where vin and v out represent the rate of fluxes generating and 
consuming metabolite (M), respectively. This work developed one 
differential equation as equation 1 for each metabolite used in the 
model. The equations and parameters used in the model were listed 
in Table 1 and the Supplementary Data (available at JXB online). 
The C
4 NADP-ME type model (Wang et al., 2014) was used as a 
basis of the kinetic models of mixed C4 pathways, upon which addi-
tional pathways were added to form various mixed-pathway models 
(Supplementary Fig. S1 available at JXB online).
Combinations of C
4 pathways
Experimental evidence has suggested that the so-called three C 4 
subtypes can coexist with each other (Hatch, 1971; Chapman and 
Hatch, 1981; Meister et al., 1996; Pick et al., 2011). For example, in 
Zea mays, about 25% of the initial carbon label partitions to aspar-
tate and about 75% to malate (MAL), which shows that Z.  mays 
uses both as transfer acids (Hatch, 1971). This mixture of C 4 sub-
types were also clearly demonstrated in a recent transcriptomics and 
enzyme activity study (Pick et  al., 2011). The use of amino acids 
in addition to malate and pyruvate does not necessarily require the

presence of PEPCK as the decarboxylation enzyme, as demonstrated 
in Sorghum bicolor, which does not have PEPCK but transcriptome 
data shows high level of Asp transaminase and Ala transaminase 
expression which suggest amino acids are also used as transfer acids 
(Gutierrez et al., 1974). Based on the knowledge above, the current 
work developed different systems models representing various com-
binations of C
4 subtypes. Those pathways with combinations of C4 
subtypes were termed as mixed C4 pathways, and models represent-
ing these mixed pathways were termed as mixed-pathway models. 
The models were named after the transfer C
4 acid and the decar -
boxylase used: Asp+MAL and PEPCK model, Asp+MAL and ME 
model, and Asp+MAL and PEPCK+ME model. In the Asp+MAL 
and PEPCK model, the transferred aspartate is decarboxylated in 
BSC cytosol by PEPCK, while in the Asp+MAL and ME model, 
the transferred aspartate is decarboxylated in BSC chloroplasts by 
NADP-ME. The Asp+MAL and ME model requires existence of 
MDH in BSCs. The Asp+MAL and PEPCK+ME model can be 
regard as an integration of the other two models. In the hypothetical 
Asp and PEPCK-only model, aspartate is the only transfer C
4 acid 
and PEPCK is the only decarboxylase in C4 cycle.
Light reactions
The electron transport rate (J) is used to calculate the rates of ATP 
and NADPH synthesis in the models. The maximum rate of ATP 
and NADPH synthesis reactions were described as:
 VV VEJmaxm ax maxmin( ,)=  (2)
where VmaxE is the maximum rate of ATP and NADPH synthesis 
determined by the properties of ATP synthase and NADP + reduc-
tase, and VmaxJ is calculated by the electron transport rate:
 V JJmax =⋅ε  (3)

von Caemmerer, 2000).
J of MC (J
m) and BSC (J b) were calculated separately (Wang 
et al., 2014; Supplementary Data available at JXB online), In this 
model, the proportion of linear electron transport (LET) in BSCs, 
as reflected in the PSII content in BSCs, was assumed to be variable:

u=v=LETBSC. If u and v are 0, there is no LET in BSCs; if u and v 
are 1, all light and Jmax take part in LET in BSCs. Ib represents light

During the simulation, it was assumed that the model reached a 
steady state when the predicted metabolite concentrations did not 
change with time any more. The steady-state metabolite levels and 
flux rates were extracted from model output after the model reached 
a steady state. The CO
2 assimilation rate (A) was calculated as 
(Farquhar et al., 1980):
 A vv Rco d=− −05.  (10)
where vc and vo are the rates of RuBP carboxylation and oxygena-
tion, respectively, and R d is the rate of mitochondrial respiration. 
The default value for Rd is 1 μmol m–2 s–1, with the rate of respiration 
in both BSCs (Rb) and MCs (Rm) being equal as 0.5 μmol m–2 s–1.
Results
Model structures and predicted photosynthetic rates 
under different light and CO2 levels
The four mixed-pathway models were analysed together with a 
standard NADP-ME model (Fig. 1). First, the models were used 
to predict responses of CO
2 assimilation rate (A) to the photo-
synthetic photon flux density (PPFD) (Fig. 2). The standard 
NADP-ME model had the highest predicted assimilation rate 
at photon flux densities below a threshold of 1000  μmol m
–2 
s–1. Above this threshold, a mixed model assuming transfer of 
Asp and malate but only decarboxylation through NADP-ME 
(Asp+MAL and ME) showed the highest assimilation rate. 
Compared to the standard NADP-ME model, all the mixed 
models assuming PEPCK activity had lower assimilation rates 
at photon flux densities below 2000 μmol m
–2 s–1. Apart from 
the PEPCK-only model, which has no photosynthesis rate, 
photosynthetic responses predicted by all other models were 
comparable to experimental data from maize (Fig. 2; Leegood 
and von Caemmerer, 1989).

New classification of C4 photosynthesis | 3571
The predicted leakiness was increased in all mixed-path-
way models compared to the standard NADP-ME model 
(Fig. 3A). The modelled leakiness under different light levels 
was generally consistent with measured leakiness for maize 
(Fig.  3A) and Flaveria, two typical NADP-ME subtype C
4 
plants. The predicted photorespiratory rate was highest in the 
standard NADP-ME model and lower in all mixed models 
(Fig. 3B). The photorespiratory rate is a function of the CO
2 
and O2 concentration around Rubisco. In this simulation, O2 
concentration was constant, because no LET generated O 2 
in BSCs, while there were additional pathways that increased 
CO
2 concentration in BSCs (Supplementary Fig. S3 available 
at JXB online). Therefore, the simulations showed that the 
photorespiratory rate was suppressed in all mixed models; 
furthermore, compared to models including PEPCK activ-
ity, the standard NADP-ME model had a higher assimilation 
rate and lower leakiness while the Asp+MAL+ME model 
had a lower photorespiratory rate.
Transfer metabolite gradients and concentration 
changes
The mixed model presented for maize (Pick et  al., 2011) 
includes five transfer acids (Asp, malate, Ala, pyruvate, and 
PEP) and two decarboxylation enzymes. Y et the model pre-
dictions for assimilation rate, leakiness, and photorespiration 
dismissed a mixed model, because a mixed model showed 
lower energy-use efficiency and higher leakiness, although it 
suppressed photorespiration rate (Figs 2 and 3). Hence, this 
work tested whether a mixed model altered other parameters 
which may explain why the mixed pathway was realized dur-
ing evolution. In theory, the concurrent use of several species 
of transfer acids will reduce the necessary concentration gra-
dients for each of them (Fig. 4A and B). Movement of these 
metabolites between MCs and BSCs was assumed to follow a 
diffusional process through plasmodesmata, as has been sug-
gested earlier (Stitt and Heldt, 1985). The transport rates are 
dependent on the concentration gradient and the diffusion 
coefficient of each individual metabolite.
The model simulation indicated that the malate gradient 
between MCs and BSCs was only slightly lower in all mixed 
models as compared to the standard NADP-ME model. 
The pyruvate gradient was also only slightly lower in the 
Asp+MAL and ME model, but it was approximately halved 
in the mixed model, which allowed for PEPCK activity. The 
reduction in pyruvate transport was compensated by con-
current transport of PEP and alanine, indicating that the 
model predictions confirmed the theoretical estimations 
with regard to the C
3 but only marginally so for the C4 acids 
(Fig. 4C).
Fig. 2. Curves for models predicting CO2 assimilation vs. photosynthetic 
photon flux density (PPFD). The models were named after the transfer C4 
acid and the decarboxylase used. In the Asp+MAL and PEPCK model, the 
transferred aspartate is decarboxylated in BSC cytosol by PEPCK; in the 
Asp+MAL and ME model, the transfer acid aspartate is decarboxylated in 
BSC chloroplasts by NADP-ME. The Asp+MAL and PEPCK+ME model 
can be regarded as an integration of these two models. In the NADP-ME 
model, malate is the only transfer C
4 acid and the decarboxylase is 
NADP-ME. The Asp and PEPCK-only model describes a hypothetical 
condition that the transferred aspartate can only be decarboxylated by 
PEPCK. Black dots indicate experimental data from maize (Leegood and

The concentrations of transfer acids were also different 
between the models. The highest amount of transfer acids 
was present in the standard NADP-ME model, closely fol-
lowed by the Asp+MAL and ME model. The models using 
PEPCK activity had lower total transfer acid contents 
(Fig. 5A). For malate, the standard NADP-ME model pre-
dicted the highest content, followed by the Asp+MAL and 
ME model; the models using PEPCK had lower malate con-
tents (Fig. 5B). For all other transfer acids, the Asp+MAL 
and ME model predicted the highest contents (Fig. 5C– F), 
for pyruvate up to 3-times higher compared to the mixed 
models (Fig. 5D). It is notable that the malate contents were 
an order of magnitude higher compared to the other transfer 
acids (Fig. 5B).
In summary, the models including PEPCK activity had lower 
transfer acids contents and lower gradients, which matched the 
aforementioned theoretical considerations (Fig. 5).
Mixed pathways shift the optimal energy allocation 
between BSCs and MCs and show that linear electron 
transport in BSCs is permissible
Theoretically, using different transfer acids should also affect 
the optimum of light energy allocation between MCs and

BSCs, assuming that LET is present and no reducing equiva-
lents are shuttled by metabolites. However, the model predicted 
very similar optimal light allocations for four different assump-
tions of LET (Fig. 6); hence, reducing equivalents could not 
exclusively result from LET but must be shuttled also by metab-
olites. All LET-BSC assumptions predicted that 60–70% of 
light is allocated to the MCs for optimal photosynthetic assim-
ilation rates. Compared to a standalone NADP-ME type C
4 
photosynthesis, the Asp+MAL and ME model was predicted 
to have a higher photosynthesis rate if MCs absorbed more 
than 70% of incident light, while the Asp+MAL and PEPCK 
model was predicted to have a higher photosynthesis rate if 
MCs absorbed less than 50% of light (Fig. 6). The highest rates 
achieved mirror those of Fig. 2, with the standard model reach-
ing the highest assimilation rate followed by the Asp+MAL 
and ME model, followed by the models using PEPCK.
The curves for all models except for the Asp+PEPCK 
model were essentially invariant in various LET ratios in 
BSCs. All curves peaked at similar assimilation values, indi-
cating that different assumptions of BSC LET permitted 
similarly optimal photosynthetic rates.
Photosystem II in BSCs is essential for a pathway 
where only aspartate and PEPCK are used
When no LET was assumed in BSCs, the model which assumed 
only aspartate as the transfer acid and only PEPCK as the 
decarboxylase, predicted a zero photosynthetic CO
2 uptake 
rate, no matter how high the PEPCK and AspAT activities 
were set (Fig. 7). Aspartate does not transfer reducing equiva-
lents to BSCs and the latter cannot generate NADPH through 
light reactions in the absence of LET, therefore no NADPH 
to support the CO
2 assimilation by the Calvin–Benson cycle 
in BSCs is available in this scenario. In a system with LET in 
the BSCs, the rate of photosynthetic CO
2 uptake was propor-
tional to the rate of LET in the BSCs. As shown in Fig. 6, the 
optimal energy allocation was in MCs and BSCs was 20 and 
80%, respectively, of total incident light energy.
Discussion
This work first discusses the potential physiological signifi-
cance of having mixed C
4 pathways on the basis of theo-
retical analyses using a systems modelling approach. Then 
it discusses whether the current classification of C
4 subtypes 
should be reconsidered.
This work tested different models of C 4 photosynthesis 
with regard to transfer acids and decarboxylation enzymes. 
The models indicated that a standard NADP-ME model was 
favoured with regard to total photosynthetic rate at low PPFD, 
because higher leakiness of mixed models decreases energy-use 
efficiency at low PPFD. Under high light, models with ME as 
the decarboxylation enzyme were superior over models that 
assumed PEPCK as the sole or partial decarboxylation enzyme 
(Fig. 2). A higher CO
2 concentration in the BSC chloroplasts 
will increase photosynthetic efficiency of Rubisco. However,

PEPCK releases CO2 in BSC cytosol, while NADP-ME releases 
CO2 in BSC chloroplasts, which hence shows superiority under 
high-light conditions (Supplementary Fig. S3 available at JXB 
online). Leakiness was also lowest for the classical NADP-ME 
model. Having a mixed pathway increased the overall C4 path-
way activity since it reduced limitations on acid generation 
and transport in the C
4 cycle, while the Calvin–Benson cycle 
activity stayed the same. The faster C 4 cycle released more 
CO2 in BSCs (enhanced overcycling), which increased the 
CO2 concentration in BSCs (Supplementary Fig. S3 available 
at JXB online). As a result, leakiness increased in all mixed 
models (Fig. 3A). Additional pathways should increase leaki-
ness, but the model might somewhat overestimate the increase 
in leakiness. Because of the limitation of ordinary differential 
equation models, the current models could not include the 
positioning of the organelles and therefore neglected cytosolic 
resistance, which is also a part of the total bundle sheath resist-
ance, especially important for the PEPCK and NAD-ME sub-
type (von Caemmerer and Furbank RT, 2003). This is the most 
likely reason for the overestimation of leakiness in the current 
models, especially for leakiness of CO
2 released by PEPCK in 
BS cytosol (Fig. 3A). Y et, for many C4 species, PEPCK activity 
in addition to NADP-ME or NAD-ME activity, is well docu-
mented (Meister et al., 1996; Wingler et al., 1999; Muhaidat 
et al., 2007; Pick et al., 2011; Sommer et al., 2012; Muhaidat 
and McKown, 2013). Hence, this work interrogated the models 
to identify factors that might explain why mixed models were 
favoured in evolution.
Physiological significance of having mixed C4 pathways
In a mixed pathway, in addition to malate and pyruvate, also 
aspartate, PEP, and alanine are used as transfer acids between 
MCs and BSCs. Utilizing two C
4 acids and three C3 acids can 
reduce the diffusion requirements for any one acid between 
MCs and BSCs (Pick et al., 2011), because the total flux of 
the C
4 and C 3 acids is shared between two or three metabo-
lites. The simulations indicated that a mixed pathway reduced 
the metabolite concentrations and gradients required to sus-
tain the C
4 cycle (Fig. 4A and B).
In the model, since the flux through Asp was set to around 
25%, according to the carbon label partition experiment by 
Hatch (1971), the gradient necessary for malate was reduced 
but not halved, while the gradients for pyruvate, especially 
for the mixed models which include PEPCK activity, were 
substantially reduced for each transfer acid (Fig. 4C). This is 
because the flux through the C
3 acid can be shared by pyru-
vate, PEP, and alanine in a mixed pathway. This might at least 
partially explain the phenomenon that no concentration gra-
dient was measured for pyruvate between BSCs and MCs in 
maize (Stitt and Heldt, 1985). Until now, no C
4 species has 
been reported in which only one C4 and one C3 transfer acid 
is in use; hence, evolution has implemented multiple transfer 
acids in all C
4 plants studied so far.
Concomitant with the decreased concentration gradients, 
mixed C4 pathways also lead to decreased concentrations of 
transfer acids, except the Asp+MAL and ME type under high 
light (Fig. 5). The finding that the Asp+MAL and ME type 
had higher acid concentrations has two possible explana-
tions. One is that this model displayed a higher photosynthe-
sis rate and higher leakiness (Figs 2 and 3), which indicates 
that C
4 cycle flux in the Asp+MAL and ME type was much 
higher than other models: higher fluxes demand relatively 
higher metabolite concentrations. The other reason is that 
the simulated pyruvate concentration was much higher than 
other models’ predictions. In the Asp+MAL and ME model,

New classification of C4 photosynthesis | 3575
although both alanine and pyruvate moved back to MCs, 
all of the alanine was needed to form pyruvate again before 
transport into MC chloroplasts to generate PEP by pyruvate 
phosphate dikinase. Therefore, in the Asp+MAL and ME 
model, more pyruvate accumulated in MCs, and the con-
centration of pyruvate in BSCs was also higher, to maintain 
the concentration gradient for diffusion. Having a decreased 
concentration of transfer acids might also prevent excessive 
accumulation of acidic substances, and decreasing the con-
centration of pyruvate can be beneficial because pyruvate is 
highly diffusible and thus its fluxes are difficult to control.
The recruitment of amino transferases to the C
4 cycle might 
have been facilitated by the ubiquitous presence of relatively 
high activities of Asp aminotransferase and Ala aminotrans-
ferase activities in many C
3 plants (compare with Bräutigam 
et al., 2011; Gowik et al., 2011; Sommer et al., 2012). Possibly, 
C4 plants early in evolution may have initially utilized Asp 
as the predominant transfer acid, exploiting the fact that the 
presence of high amounts of glutamate as an amino donor 
and high amounts of OAA produced by increased PEPC 
activity would drive Asp aminotransferase to transaminate 
OAA to Asp.
In addition to reducing the concentration gradients 
required to run the C
4 cycle, having a mixed pathway would 
increase the robustness of C4 metabolism by maintaining the 
energy balance between MCs and BSCs in response to rap-
idly changing light conditions. Energy balances, including 
both NADPH and ATP balance, in both BSCs and MCs are 
required for maintaining a high efficiency of C
4 photosynthe-
sis. This theoretical study suggested that mixed C4 pathways, 
compared to a pathway with NADP-ME subtype C 4 pho-
tosynthesis, inherently have extra mechanisms to maintain 
energy balances.
First, changing the proportion of transferred C
4 acid (i.e. 
the ratio of transported malate to aspartate) modulates the 
NADPH balance between MCs and BSCs (Evans et  al., 
2007). If malate is used as the transfer acid, it will move 
NADPH to the BSCs simultaneously; while, if aspartate is 
used, no NADPH is moved to the BSCs. Secondly, the utiliza-
tion of PEPCK, which uses ATP in BSCs, as decarboxylase, 
can increase the ATP requirement in BSCs. Thirdly, the PSII 
levels in BSCs chloroplasts control the NADPH production 
in BSCs, which correspondingly influences the NADPH bal-
ance. Consistent with this hypothesis, the PSII contents of 
BSCs in a number of species conducting NADP-ME type 
photosynthesis have been shown to be proportional to the 
amount of aspartate produced as the translocated C
4 acid 
(Chapman and Hatch, 1981; Meister et al., 1996). Since LET 
in the bundle sheath leads to the liberation of oxygen at the 
site of Rubisco, one may ask whether the absence of LET 
improves C
4 photosynthetic efficiency. The modelling study 
suggests that the peak assimilation rate is independent of 
the amount of LET in BSCs as long as the LET ratio is half 
or less (Fig. 6). This may be related to why a range of BSC 
chloroplast morphologies, representing different amounts of 
LET, can be identified in C
4 plants (Y oshimura et al., 2004)
The ability to utilize multiple decarboxylases and transfer 
acids can potentially enable C 4 photosynthesis to maintain 
higher photosynthetic efficiency under a wider range of light 
regimes, where allocations of light into MCs and BSCs dif-
fer. Under conditions where BSCs absorb more light, PEPCK 
can use the extra energy in BSCs to operate the CO
2 pump 
and decrease the energy demand of pyruvate phosphate 
dikinase in MCs. The simulation results indicated that the 
Asp+MAL and PEPCK type could obtain higher photosyn-
thesis rate if MCs absorbed less than 50% of light as com-
pared to the NADP-ME type (Fig.  6). Under conditions 
where MCs absorbed more light, the usage of aspartate as 
the transfer acid reduced NADPH transferred from MCs to 
BSCs, more PGA will be moved to MCs to use the NADPH 
and ATP in MCs. The Asp+MAL and ME type can obtain a 
higher photosynthetic rate than the NADP-ME type if MC 
absorbs more than 70% of light (Fig. 6). Therefore, a mixed 
C
4 pathway provides robustness to the pathway under fluctu-
ating environmental conditions.
Despite having all these aforementioned benefits of mixed 
pathways, a mixed pathway can lead to increased leakiness, 
which reduces photosynthetic efficiency. However, C
4 plants 
have evolved mechanisms to cope with this inevitable con-
sequence. Modelling analysis showed that reduced PEPC 
activity could decrease leakiness without significantly affect-
ing the photosynthetic rate (Supplementary Fig. S2 avail-
able at JXB online). If PEPC activity was decreased by 15%, 
leakiness was reduced by about 7% in high-light conditions. 
Coincidently, enzyme activity data of a leaf developmental 
gradient in Z.  mays show that in the tip of the leaf PEPC 
activity decreased when PEPCK activity was significantly 
elevated (Pick et al., 2011). A similar negative correlation of 
PEPCK and PEPC activity was also found in C.  gynandra 
(Sommer et  al., 2012). PEPC protein amounts also slightly 
decreased in the tip of maize; however, the RNA expression 
increased in the tip (Majeran et al., 2010; Pick et al., 2011). 
The experimental evidence indicated that C
4 plants may have 
evolved post-transcriptional regulatory mechanisms to limit 
leakiness and maintain high photosynthetic efficiency
Even with all these mechanisms to regain energy balances 
in BSCs and MCs, C
4 leaves can still suffer energy imbalances 
between BSCs and MCs under a few artificial conditions, 
which correspondingly decrease photosynthetic efficiency. 
As an example, under blue light the photosynthetic efficiency 
of a C
4 plant decreases more than that of a C 3 plant (Evans 
et al., 2007; Sun et al., 2012). This is possibly because blue 
light is strongly absorbed by surface MCs (Vogelmann and 
Han, 2000; Vogelmann and Evans, 2002), which leaves little 
energy available for BSCs to gain an energy balance required 
to maintain a higher photosynthetic efficiency.
C4 plants can be effectively classified into either 
NADP-ME or NAD-ME type C4 photosynthesis
Given these physiological significance of having mixtures 
of C
4 decarboxylases and transfer acids, are there three 
subtypes of C 4 photosynthesis? The standard NADP-ME 
model has not been realized in any C 4 plant studied to date. 
S. bicolor might represent the Asp+MAL and ME type since 
no PEPCK activity has been reported. The C
4 genus Flaveria 
3576 | Wang et al.
also has very limited PEPCK activity (Gowik et  al., 2011) 
and thus is closer to the Asp+MAL and ME type of C 4 pho-
tosynthesis than to the Asp+MAL and ME+PEPCK type. 
The Asp+MAL and ME+PEPCK model is represented by 
maize with NADP-ME as the ME (Pick et  al., 2011), by 
C.  gynandra with NAD-ME as the ME (Bräutigam et  al., 
2011; Sommer et al., 2012) and by multiple other dicot species 
of the order Caryophyllales (Muhaidat and McKown, 2013). 
Similarly, plants that realize a PEPCK-only model have not 
been identified so far. The metabolic process of the PEPCK 
pathway usually also includes the reactions involved in the 
NAD-ME type C
4 photosynthesis (Burnell and Hatch, 1988). 
On this aspect, plants that use PEPCK as the dominating 
decarboxylase but not as the only decarboxylase do exist in 
monocotyledons (Gutierrez et al., 1974). For example, Zoysia 
japonica Steud in Eragrostoideae and Urochloa panicoides 
Beauv in Panicoideae have 3–5 times higher PEPCK activ-
ity than those of the NADP-ME and NAD-ME (Gutierrez 
et al., 1974; Muhaidat et al., 2007).
Recent genome-scale transcriptomic analyses in com-
bination with enzyme activity assays have further shown 
that maize (Pick et  al., 2011) and C.  gynandra ( Sommer 
et  al., 2012) have PEPCK activity in the C
4 cycle. Based 
on literature research and the modelling effort, the pre-
sent work sorted these species, in addition to Megathyrsus 
maximus, a C
4 plant classified as PEPCK type (Gutierrez 
et al., 1974), and S. bicolor, a species with a relatively ‘pure’ 
NADP-ME type decarboxylation chemistry (Gutierrez 
et al., 1974), according to the proportion of PEPCK in total 
decarboxylase activity in both NADP-ME and NAD-ME 
type C
4 photosynthesis (Fig. 8E). Apparently, PEPCK plays 
a bigger role than previously assumed. Not only classical 
PEPCK plants but also NADP-ME and NAD-ME plants 
use substantial amounts of decarboxylation by PEPCK 
(see also Muhaidat et al., 2007; Furbank, 2011; Pick et al., 
2011; Sommer et al., 2012; Muhaidat and McKown, 2013). 
It might therefore be useful to consider C
4 plants as either 
NAD-ME or NADP-ME plants, as there is a clear demar -
cation line based on the type of decarboxylase, with vari-
able contributions of PEPCK (Fig. 8A– D). In other words, 
PEPCK might be considered as a supplementary activity to 
the malate-decarboxylating enzymes, not as an independent 
C
4 decarboxylation activity, with the benefits of providing 
additional mechanisms to balance energy between BSCs 
and MCs and helping to decrease the metabolite concentra-
tions of the transported acids.

indicate where it is not clear whether the circles are also connected at this point by Asp aminotransferase and MDH, The C4 cycles have to be rewritten 
as branched cycles that split at the position of C4 transfer acid into aspartate and malate and at the position of C3 transfer acid into pyruvate, alanine, and 
(for PEPCK-using species) PEP . The proportions of different transfer acids probably vary with changing environmental conditions: for example, light for 
malate reduction or nitrogen availability for amino acids as transfer acids. (E) Contribution of PEPCK to malic enzyme activity in five different C4 species.

New classification of C4 photosynthesis | 3577
However, many C 4 dicots and monocots (e.g. sorghum; 
Fig.  8E), do not show high activities of PEPCK in some 
measurements (Gutierrez et al., 1974; Muhaidat et al., 2007), 
which possibly indicates that these species do not use PEPCK 
as a supplemental decarboxylation enzyme. This model anal-
ysis showed that standalone NADP-ME pathway also has 
good photosynthetic performance in many cases (Figs 2, 3, 
and 6). Even within the same plant, PEPCK activity can be 
flexible (e.g. high PEPCK activity is only detected in the tip 
of a maize leaf and in old leaves of cleome; Pick et al., 2011; 
Sommer et al., 2012). Therefore, the current analysis shows 
that the single NADP-ME pathway and the mixed pathways 
each have their own advantages (Figs 2–6): if the flux alloca-
tion in different pathways is flexible in C
4 plants, these plants 
can have better adaptability under changing environmental 
conditions.
Can the PEPCK pathway exists in isolation: i.e. is there a C
4 
photosynthetic subtype where no NAD-ME or NADP-ME 
exists at all? Analysis from this study showed that photosys-
tem II in BSCs is essential for a pure PEPCK C
4 photosyn-
thetic pathway that uses only PEPCK as the decarboxylase 
and only aspartate as the C
4 transfer acid from MCs to BSCs 
(Fig.  7). This is because NADPH, which is required for 
3-PGA reduction in the Calvin Benson Cycle, cannot be gen-
erated in such a C
4 pathway unless there is LET in BSCs (i.e. 
only if there is PSII in BSCs). A higher LET rate in BSCs is 
needed for a high photosynthesis rate (Fig. 7) in such a path-
way. In this case, PEPCK releases CO
2 in BSCs cytosol and 
uses ATP in BSCs. Thus a PEPCK-only type prefers more 
energy allocated to BSCs. The current theoretical analysis 
suggests that the optimal energy allocation was 20% in MCs 
and 80% in BSCs. This, however, is next to impossible to real-
ize because of the structure of the Kranz anatomy, where 
BSCs are surrounded by MCs and correspondingly light will 
be inevitably preferentially absorbed by MCs before reaching 
the BSCs. This unbalanced energy supply and usage in BSCs 
and MCs might have prevented evolution of C
4 plants with 
PEPCK as the only decarboxylase and aspartate as the only 
transfer acid.
Another possibility that may limit the existence of the 
PEPCK-only pathway is the inability to maintain a proper 
amino group balance between BSCs and MCs. In the PEPCK 
pathway, aspartate is transported from MCs to BSCs, and 
PEP was transported from BSCs back to MCs, which cre-
ates an imbalance of amino groups between two cell types 
(Weber and Bräutigam, 2013). This problem can be solved in 
the PEPCK-only type model if amino groups are transported 
back to MCs in the form of alanine, and a reversed pyruvate 
transport together with alanine keeps both amino group and 
carbon transport balanced in both MCs and BSCs.
Conclusion
In summary, this modelling analysis and literature survey 
shows that a mixed mode of C
4 photosynthesis provides met-
abolic robustness through reduced metabolite gradients and 
metabolite concentrations. Operation of a mixed mode of C
4 
photosynthesis can confer higher ecological robustness due 
to increased tolerance to fluctuating light conditions. A pure 
PEPCK-type C
4 photosynthesis is not beneficial because 
the energy requirements in BSCs cannot be fulfilled due to 
them being shaded by MCs. Hence, only the NAD-ME and 
NADP-ME subtypes should be considered as distinct sub-
types, with the PEPCK pathway as a supplement to these.
