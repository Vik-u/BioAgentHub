Simple Summary: In this study, we investigated the effects of adding soybean oligosaccharides
(SBOS) to growing–ﬁnishing pig diets on growth performance, carcass traits, meat quality, and fat
deposition. SBOS are considered to be one of the causes of diarrhea in piglets. However, their impact
on growing and fattening pigs has not been reported. The results of this study showed that adding
0.8% SBOS to the diet of growing–ﬁnishing pigs can increase the average daily weight gain. Hindgut
fermentation of SBOS, which alters the composition of short-chain fatty acids, was the mechanism
behind the reduction in fat deposition in growing–ﬁnishing pigs.
Abstract: One hundred and twenty-eight boars and gilts of the Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire
variety with an initial body weight (BW) of 52.49 ± 0.48 kg were used in a randomized complete
block design for a 63-day experiment. The four treatment groups were: control diet (CON), CON
+ 0.2% soybean oligosaccharides (SBOS), CON + 0.4% SBOS, and CON + 0.8% SBOS. The results
showed that the average daily weight gain (ADG) was signiﬁcantly higher in the 0.8% SBOS group
than in the CON group on days 0–63 (p < 0.05). Compared with the CON group, adding 0.8% SBOS to
the diet signiﬁcantly increased the carcass weight, dressing percentage, and carcass lean percentage,
but decreased the average backfat depth of growing–ﬁnishing pigs ( p < 0.05). Adding different
concentrations (0.2%, 0.4%, and 0.8%) of SBOS to the diet can signiﬁcantly increase the concentrations
of acetate, propionate, and butyrate in feces ( p < 0.05). The activities of malic enzyme and fatty
acid synthase in the 0.8% group were signiﬁcantly lower than those in the 0.2% and CON groups
(p < 0.05). In summary, 0.8% SBOS supplementation to growing–ﬁnishing pigs’ diets can reduce lipid
deposition and increase ADG.

1. Introduction
Soybean oligosaccharides (SBOS) are the major carbohydrates contained in soybean
meal. A previous study has shown that SBOS had prebiotic properties due to their ability
to regulate intestinal microbial structure and metabolism and were considered safe and
reliable materials [1]. However, monogastric animals lack endogenous enzymes to digest
SBOS, so SBOS are difﬁcult to utilize for monogastric animals. Research on SBOS in pigs is
very limited. Previous studies on piglets showed that a high concentration of SBOS (1%)
could cause intestinal disorders and diarrhea in piglets [ 2]. The digestibility of organic

matter and crude protein (CP) decreased by 25% in piglets fed high concentrations of
SBOS soybean hulls [ 3]. The addition of SBOS to the diet of growing pigs reduced the
digestibility of nitrogen and amino acids [ 4]. The above studies have shown that SBOS
play the role of anti-nutritional factors in the diet of pigs. An in vitro fermentation test
using Huanjiang mini-pigs’ colon digesta showed that SBOS can improve the balance and
metabolism of colonic ﬂora [5]. A study conducted on mice demonstrated that the intake
of soybean oligosaccharides led to an increase in the count of advantageous gut microbes,
which consequently enhanced the immune system of the mice [6]. In addition, studies have
shown that short-chain oligosaccharides that cannot be digested by upper gastrointestinal
digestive enzymes can be selectively fermented by certain bacteria in the large intestine [7,8].
We speculate that pigs can utilize SBOS through hindgut microbial fermentation. Diarrhea
caused by SBOS in piglets may be due to the limited fermentation capacity of the hindgut.
However, the effect of SBOS on growth performance and other indicators of ﬁnishing pigs
has not yet been reported. We hypothesized that growing–ﬁnishing pigs can efﬁciently
utilize SBOS. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of dietary SBOS
supplementation at different concentrations on growth performance, carcass characteristics,
meat quality, and fat deposition in growing–ﬁnishing pigs.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Experiment Design, Animals, and Environment
One hundred and twenty-eight boars and gilts of the Duroc × Landrace × Yorkshire
variety with an initial body weight (BW) of 52.49± 0.48 kg were employed in a randomized
complete block design for a 63-day experiment. Pigs were randomly divided into four
treatment groups based on BW and sex before the experiment. Each dietary treatment
had eight replicates with four pigs per replicate (two boars and two gilts). The four
treatment groups were: control diet (CON), CON + 0.2% SBOS, CON + 0.4% SBOS, and
CON + 0.8% SBOS. All of the pigs utilized in the experiment originated from New Hope
Beichuan New Changle Agricultural Husbandry Co. SBOS were purchased from Mianyang
Heben Bioengineering Co., Ltd. (Mianyang, China). The basic diet was divided into
two phases according to National Research Council (2012) recommendations [9]. The basal
diets for the two different phases are shown in Table 1. The form of feed was powder. On
day 21, the pigs were moved from the growing house to the ﬁnishing house, and the diet
was changed. For the duration of the experiment, all the pigs were housed in plastic ﬂoor
pens and had free access to food and water. Each pen in the growing and ﬁnishing pig
houses was equipped with a semi-automatic feed trough and a nipple drinker. The size of
the growing pig pen was 1.1 m× 2.1 m. The size of the ﬁnishing pig pen was 1.5 m × 3.1 m.
The temperature and humidity of the growing house throughout the experiment were
20–22 ◦C and 60%, respectively. The temperature and humidity of the ﬁnishing house
throughout the experiment were 19–21 ◦C and 60%, respectively.

2.2. Growth Performance and Sample Collection
The BW for each pig was measured to determine average daily gain (ADG) at 8 a.m. on
days 0, 21, 42, and 63. Daily amounts of feed and residual feed in each pen were recorded
to determine the average daily feed intake (ADFI) and feed-to-gain ratio. Chrome trioxide
(0.5%) was added as an endogenous indicator during the last week (days 57 to 63) of the
experiment. Fecal samples were obtained via rectal massage of pigs in each pen from 6 a.m.
on day 62 to 6 a.m. on day 63 to determine digestibility values of dry matter (DM), CP , ether
extract (EE), and gross energy (GE). At 7 a.m. on day 63, jugular venous blood was collected
from one pig per pen to assess blood components, with a male-to-female ratio of 1:1 in each
treatment group. After weighing, the blood-collected pigs were slaughtered via jugular
exsanguination after electronarcosis. After slaughter, the carcass weight and length were
measured. From the carcass weight and the slaughter weight, the dressing percentage was
calculated. The average backfat thickness of all pigs was calculated by measuring at three
different sites (shoulder, mid-back, and loin) 5 cm to the right of the midline, just above the
point of the elbow, last rib, and last lumbar vertebra. A small amount of backfat sample was
collected to measure fat cell diameter and lipid metabolism-related enzyme activity. The
lean meat percentage was calculated by dividing the left carcass after slaughtering into lean
meat, fat, skin, and bones. A portion of the longissimus dorsi muscle (LDM) was harvested
to determine meat quality. Colonic contents were collected to determine short-chain fatty
acid (SCFA) concentration.
2.3. Nutrient Digestibility and Blood Proﬁle Analysis
Collected feces and feed samples were dried in a ventilated oven at 65 ◦C for 2 days.
The dried samples were crushed and passed through a 1 mm sieve. The method used herein
was adapted from Liu et al. to determine the concentration of calcium and phosphorus
in the diet [10]. The content of DM was determined by drying the sample at 105 ◦C for
2 h. CP concentration was determined using the Leco CHNS-932 analyzer combustion
method (Leco Corp., St. Joseph, MI, USA). EE was determined using the Soxhlet extraction
method. GE in dietary and fecal samples was analyzed using a fully automated calorimeter
(BYLRY-3000W, Beijing Grand Boyu Technology. Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). Fecal and feed
samples were treated with concentrated nitric acid and perchloric acid, and the absorbance
of the digestion solution at 450 nm was measured to determine the concentration of
Cr2O3 [11]. The components in the blood were measured using a hematology analyzer
(BK-600, biobased, Jinan, China).
2.4. Meat Quality Analysis
The LDM muscle pH at 45 min and 24 h was determined using a pH meter (pH-STAR;
SFK-Technology, Herlev, Denmark). Determination of L*, a*, and b* values of LDM was
accomplished using a colorimeter CR-300 (Minolta, Osaka, Japan). Dripping loss was
assessed after the suspension of LDM at 4 ◦C for 24 h. The LDM was vacuum-packed and
then placed in a 70 ◦C water bath to measure the cooking loss. The shear force of LDM was
measured using a texture analyzer (TA.XT. plus; Stable Microsystems, Surrey, UK) [12].
Animals 2023, 13, 3648 4 of 10
2.5. SCFAs Analysis
Initially, 15 g of colon contents was weighed; they were then mixed with 15 mL of
distilled water and centrifuged at 4000 × g and 18 ◦C for 5 min. From the supernatant,
5 mL was extracted. Then, an equal proportion of HCl was added and the solution was
mixed. Then, the solution was submitted to centrifugation at 14,000 × g and 17 ◦C for
10 min. Afterward, the supernatant was extracted and injected into a gas chromatograph
coupled to a ﬂame ionization detector. The column contained 10% SP 1200, 1% H3PO4 and
acid-washed 80/100 Chromosorb W (length 1.8 m) with stationary phase SP 1200 (Supelco,
PA, USA). Nitrogen was used as the carrier gas.
2.6. Lipid Metabolism Analysis
Backfat was extracted using methanol–chloroform to determine lipid content. Back
fat was stained with hematoxylin and eosin to measure the diameter of adipocytes. The
adipose tissue was embedded in parafﬁn and sectioned. After dehydration to remove
parafﬁn and water, the tissue was stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Subsequently, the
tissue samples were microscopically photographed and the diameter of adipose cells was
measured [13]
Lipogenic enzyme activity method: ﬁrst, a mixed solution of 0.25 mol/L frozen sucrose,
1 mmol/L EDTA, and 1 mmol/L dithiothreitol was prepared. Then, 500 mg of backfat was
placed into the mixed solution and homogenized. Then, the mixture was centrifuged at
10,000× g and 4 ◦C for 1 h. The supernatant was taken to measure the activities of malic
enzyme (ME) and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G-6-PDH) at 340 nm absorbance at
25 ◦C, and the activity of fatty acid synthase (FAS) at 340 nm absorbance at 28 ◦C [14,15].
2.7. Statistical Analysis
The soy oligosaccharide level added to the diet was evaluated through ANOVA
analysis using SAS’s GLM procedure (SAS Inst. Inc., Cary, NC, USA) with a randomized
complete block design. Growth performance and nutrient digestibility were analyzed using
the pen as the experimental unit. Blood proﬁle, carcass quality, meat quality, SCFA, and
lipid metabolism were analyzed using the individual pig as the experimental unit. Results
with p < 0.05 were considered statistically signiﬁcant.
3. Results
3.1. Growth Performance, Nutrient Digestibility, and Blood Proﬁle
The average BW on day 63 and the ADG from days 0–63 of the group receiving 0.8%
SBOS were signiﬁcantly greater than those of the CON group (Table 2, p < 0.05). However,
we did not observe signiﬁcant differences in ADFI, feed-to-gain ratio (Table 2, p > 0.05),
and nutrient digestibility (Table 3, p > 0.05) among treatments. Compared with the CON
group, the concentration of HDL-C in the blood in the 0.8% SBOS group was signiﬁcantly
increased (Table 4, p < 0.05). There were no signiﬁcant changes in blood LDL-C, GLU,
T-CHO, and TG concentrations among treatment groups (Table 4,p > 0.05).

3.2. Carcass Traits and Meat Quality
Compared with the CON group, adding 0.8% SBOS to the diet signiﬁcantly increased
the carcass weight, dressing percentage, and carcass lean percentage, but decreased the
average backfat depth of growing–ﬁnishing pigs (Table 5, p < 0.05). Feeding 0.4% SBOS
increased the carcass weight of growing–ﬁnishing pigs compared with the CON group
(Table 5, p < 0.05). In addition, there was no signiﬁcant effect on the meat quality of
growing–ﬁnishing pigs when feeding them different concentrations of SBOS (Table 6,
p > 0.05).

Adding different concentrations (0.2%, 0.4%, and 0.8%) of SBOS to the diet can signiﬁ-
cantly increase the concentrations of acetate, propionate, and butyrate in feces compared
with the CON group (Table 7, p < 0.05). The concentrations of acetate, propionate, and
butyrate in the feces were higher in the 0.8% SBOS group than in the 0.2% SBOS group
and the 0.4% SBOS group (Table 7, p < 0.05). The concentrations of SBOS had no effects on
adipose tissue lipid content, fat cell diameter, and G-6-PDH activity (Table 8,p > 0.05). The
activities of ME and FAS in the 0.8% group were signiﬁcantly reduced compared with the
0.2% SBOS and CON groups (Table 8, p < 0.05).

4. Discussion
4.1. Growth Performance, and Nutrient Digestibility
More economical growth performance is the ﬁrst goal pursued by agricultural and an-
imal husbandry farmers. Growth performance denotes comprehensive performance under
the combined effect of multiple factors, such as variety, feed nutritional levels, minerals
such as calcium and phosphorus, functional additives, and feeding and management lev-
els [16–23]. Previous studies in piglets have shown that dietary supplementation with soy
oligosaccharides reduced growth performance and induced diarrhea [2,24]. Zhang et al.
found that adding 1% (weight gain 0.25 vs. 0.21) and 2% (weight gain 0.25 vs. 0.17)
stachyose to piglet diets slowed the growth rate [2]. Another study showed that reducing
the addition of SBOS in piglet diets reduced diarrhea (the duration of diarrhea was 6 and
2.4 days for soybean meal and soy protein concentrate based diets, respectively) and im-
proved growth performance (the growth rate for a diet based on soy protein concentrate
and soybean meal was 244 and 224 g/day, respectively) [ 24]. Adding soybean extract
containing stachyose and rafﬁnose to piglet diets reduced the digestibility of organic matter,
nitrogen free extract, and CP by 20% [3]. In addition, supplementation of SBOS such as
stachyose and rafﬁnose was shown to reduce nitrogen (81.4 vs. 75.9) and amino acid (83.8
vs. 79.0) digestibility in studies related to growing pigs [4]. The above results were due to
the digestion of SBOS changing the penetration difference between the mucosa and plasma,
causing digestive tract disorders and increasing the risk of diarrhea in weaned piglets.
The study results demonstrated that the inclusion of SBOS in feed had no impact on the
digestibility of nutrients (DM, CP , EE, and GE). The difference between this and previous
studies may be because the fermentation capacity of intestinal microorganisms increased
after growing and fattening pigs, and the intestinal microorganisms fermented SBOS and
then changed their anti-nutritional properties, which did not affect intestinal function and
led to a decrease in nutrient digestibility. Adding 0.8% SBOS could increase the average
BW on day 63 and the average daily weight gain from days 0 to 63. This suggested that
differences in growth performance between the CON group and the 0.8% SBOS group may
be caused by changes in how nutrients were metabolized in the body.
4.2. Carcass Traits and Meat Quality
The results of this study showed that compared with the CON group, adding 0.8%
SBOS to the diet signiﬁcantly increased the carcass weight, dressing percentage, and
carcass lean percentage of growing–ﬁnishing pigs, but decreased the average backfat depth.
Therefore, we ﬁnd that pigs with added 0.8% SBOS tend to be leaner. The main reason
for the increase in carcass weight and dressing percentage may be that adding 0.8% SBOS
reduces fat deposition capacity and increases lean meat deposition. The density of lean
meat per unit volume is greater and the mass is greater. Although the addition of SBOS

changed carcass traits, we found no signiﬁcant effect on meat quality. No studies have been
found on the impact of directly adding SBOS on the quality of meat in growing fattening
pigs. However, a study has shown that adding white lupin (contains SBOS) to the diets of
growing fattening pigs does not have any negative impacts on meat nutritional quality or
carcass characteristics [25]. In short, the above results further indicate that the main reason
why adding 0.8% SBOS to the diet increased the ADG and carcass traits may be due to
the reduction in fat deposition. Besides, the outcomes indicated that the main reason why
adding 0.8% SBOS to the diet improves ADG and carcass traits may be that the metabolic
pathway changes after energy enters the body. The body uses more energy to synthesize
muscle and reduces fat synthesis.
4.3. SCFAs, Fat Deposits, and Blood Proﬁle
SCFAs are the intermediate and ﬁnal products produced by the microbial fermentation
of indigestible residues, such as polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, proteins, and peptides,
in the mammalian gastrointestinal tract [26]. The fermentation process of carbohydrates
provides the colon with metabolic end products and energy for the growth or maintenance
of intestinal ﬂora. Acetate primarily enters the portal system and serves as a peripheral
energy source; propionate is partially metabolized by colonocytes and mainly by the liver;
and butyrate is the most important fuel for colonocytes in humans and pigs. Rapid entry
of fermentable substrates into the hindgut results in the production of lactic and succinic
acids [27]. The results of this study showed that adding SBOS can signiﬁcantly increase
the content of acetate, propionate, and butyrate in feces. In addition, adding 0.8% SBOS
to the diet was more effective in increasing the concentrations of acetate, propionate, and
butyrate than in the 0.2% and 0.4% SBOS groups. This was consistent with the previous
results of in vitro fermentation using SBOS as the substrate and colonic digesta as the
inoculum, and we found that the production of acetic acid, propionic acid, and butyric
acid increased [5]. We also measured blood components. Compared with the CON group,
the results showed that the concentration of HDL-C in the blood of the 0.8% SBOS group
signiﬁcantly increased. This was consistent with the results indicating that adding SBOS
to high-fat diets in mice can signiﬁcantly increase HDL-C concentration and signiﬁcantly
improve dyslipidemia [28]. However, we did not ﬁnd that the addition of SBOS improved
the concentrations of T-CHO and TG as described in the above studies. Therefore, we can
assume that adding 0.8% SBOS to the diet can increase lipid metabolism to a certain extent.
Our study also found that adding 0.8% SBOS to the diet signiﬁcantly reduced the enzyme
activities of ME and FAS, but had no signiﬁcant effect on the lipid content of adipose tissue
and adipocyte diameter. FAS is a key multifunctional enzyme in fatty acid synthesis [29].
ME can decarboxylate malic acid to pyruvate and form NADPH, and plays a key role
in the biosynthesis of fatty acids [30,31]. It was found that adding 0.8% SBOS to the diet
can signiﬁcantly reduce fat anabolism and lipid deposition. This also explained why pigs
treated with 0.8% SBOS tend to be leaner in terms of carcass traits. In summary, adding
0.8% SBOS to the diet can increase the composition of fecal SCFAs, change the energy
supply, increase lipid catabolism, and reduce fat anabolism, thereby affecting ADG.
5. Conclusions
The growth performance of growing–ﬁnishing pigs was not signiﬁcantly affected by
dietary supplementation with 0.2% and 0.4% SBOS. The addition of 0.8% SBOS to the
diet altered SCFAs’ content, reduced fat deposition, and improved carcass traits, ADFI,
and ADG.
