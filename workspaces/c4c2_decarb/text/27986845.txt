Abstract
Portulacaceae is a family that has considerable diversity in photosynthetic phenotypes. It is one of 19 families of ter-
restrial plants where species having C4 photosynthesis have been found. Most species in Portulaca are in the alternate-
leaved (AL) lineage, which includes one clade (Cryptopetala) with taxa lacking C 4 photosynthesis and three clades 
having C4 species (Oleracea, Umbraticola and Pilosa). All three species in the Cryptopetala clade lack Kranz anatomy, 
the leaves have C 3-like carbon isotope composition and they have low levels of C 4 cycle enzymes. Anatomical, bio -
chemical and physiological analyses show they are all C3-C4 intermediates. They have intermediate CO2 compensation 
points, enrichment of organelles in the centripetal position in bundle sheath (BS) cells, with selective localization of gly-
cine decarboxylase in BS mitochondria. In the three C4 clades there are differences in Kranz anatomy types and form of 
malic enzyme (ME) reported to function in C4 (NAD-ME versus NADP-ME): Oleracea (Atriplicoid, NAD-ME), Umbraticola 
(Atriplicoid, NADP-ME) and Pilosa (Pilosoid, NADP-ME). Structural and biochemical analyses were performed on Pilosa 
clade representatives having Pilosoid-type leaf anatomy with Kranz tissue enclosing individual peripheral vascular 
bundles and water storage in the center of the leaf. In this clade, all species except P . elatior are NADP-ME-type C4 
species with grana-deficient BS chloroplasts and grana-enriched M chloroplasts. Surprisingly, P . elatior has BS chlo-
roplasts enriched in grana and NAD-ME-type photosynthesis. The results suggest photosynthetic phenotypes were 
probably derived from an ancestor with NADP-ME-type C4, with two independent switches to NAD-ME type.
Key words: C3 plants, C3-C4 intermediate, C4 plants, chloroplast ultrastructure, immunolocalization, NAD-ME type, NADP-ME 
type, photosynthetic enzymes, Portulaca, Portulacaceae.
Introduction
Most terrestrial plants have C 3-type photosynthesis, in 
which there is direct fixation of atmospheric CO 2 via ribu -
lose bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (Rubisco) in all 
chloroplast-containing leaf mesophyll (M) tissues. Only ~3% 
of terrestrial plant species are C 4, in which atmospheric CO2 
is fixed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) located

in M cells, with the production of initial compounds con -
taining four carbon atoms. Through the CO 2 concentrating 
mechanism and repression of photorespiration, C4 plants are 
recognized as having an increased capacity for carbon assimi-
lation and higher efficiency in nitrogen and water use in warm 
climates. For this reason, there is interest in genetically modi-
fying major C3 crops with C4 traits to reduce photorespiration 
(Brown, 1999; Sheehy et al., 2007). The main structural dif -
ference associated with this pathway in most C4 species is the 
specialized leaf anatomy (called Kranz type) with close coor-
dination of function between two types of cells surrounding 
vascular bundles (VB), the enlarged chlorenchymatous bundle 
sheath (BS) cells and the radially arranged M cells ( Edwards 
and Walker, 1983; Hatch, 1987; Kanai and Edwards, 1999 , 
Edwards and Voznesenskaya, 2011 ). C 4 photosynthesis has 
been found in 19 families of angiosperm plants, 16 of which 
correspond to dicot lineages (Sage, 2004).
In the order Caryophyllales there are 23 families ( Thorne 
and Reveal, 2007), eight of which have species with C 4 pho-
tosynthesis: Aizoaceae, Amaranthaceae, Caryophyllaceae, 
Gisekiaceae, Molluginaceae, Nyctaginaceae, Polygonaceae 
and Portulacaceae (Sage, 2004). Portulacaceae has 29 genera 
as traditionally circumscribed (Eggli, 2002), although it is cur-
rently considered as a family with only one genus, Portulaca 
(Nyffeler and Eggli, 2010; Hernández-Ledesma et al., 2015), 
which is known to have C4 species. Previous suggestions that 
some species of Anacampseros and Grahamia (once consid -
ered as members of Portulacaceae but now circumscribed in 
Anacampserotaceae) may be C4 are not supported by a recent 
study (Guralnick et al., 2008), which indicates the occurrence 
of Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) rather than C4 pho-
tosynthesis in these genera.
For many years it was accepted that the genus Portulaca 
includes only species having Kranz-type anatomy and C 4 
photosynthesis with two clear groups. One group was defined 
as having species with NAD-malic enzyme (NAD-ME)-type 
C4 cycle and well-developed grana in BS cell chloroplasts, as 
in P . oleracea L. (Laetsch, 1971, 1974; Gutierrez et al., 1974; 
Carolin et al., 1978; Sprey and Laetsch, 1978). Another group 
was described as having NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME) 
subtype species with agranal BS chloroplasts, with P . gran-
diflora Hook. being a well-known representative species 
(Gutierrez et al. , 1974 ; Carolin et al. , 1978 ). This diversity 
was a stimulus for more complex studies of representative 
species in the genus. A structural and functional analysis 
showed the existence of four clearly distinct C 4 types of leaf 
anatomy, which differ in the way Kranz anatomy is formed 
with respect to the position of the VB ( Voznesenskaya et 
al., 2010). Phylogenetic analyses of the suborder Cactineae, 
which included genus Portulaca, showed the existence of two 
clearly defined clades; the opposite-leaved clade (OL), and 
the alternate-leaved clade (AL), mostly corresponding to two 
previously recognized subgenera, Portulacella and Portulaca 
(Ocampo and Columbus, 2010 , 2012). There are two well-
defined clades within the OL clade representing Australian 
and African-Asian species ( Ocampo and Columbus, 2012 ). 
All representatives which have been studied in the OL clade 
have NADP-ME-type biochemistry, and a unique form of 
leaf anatomy (Portulacelloid type) where Kranz is formed 
around individual VB, which are located towards the adax -
ial side of the leaf, with several layers of water storage (WS) 
cells located towards the abaxial side ( Voznesenskaya et al., 
2010; Ocampo et al. , 2013 ). In the AL clade, from studies 
of representative species, there are four clades with differ -
ences in anatomy and forms of photosynthesis: Oleracea, 
Umbraticola, Pilosa and Cryptopetala. The Umbraticola 
clade is reported to have NADP-ME species with Atriplicoid-
type anatomy where Kranz forms around individual veins in 
planar leaves. The Oleracea clade has NAD-ME-type C4 spe-
cies with a specific variant of Atriplicoid-type leaf anatomy 
(Voznesenskaya et al., 2010). The Pilosa clade is reported to 
have NADP-ME-type C4 species with Pilosoid-type anatomy 
in which Kranz tissue encloses individual peripheral VB with 
WS tissue located in the center of the leaf. In the Cryptopetala 
clade, which is sister to the Oleracea clade, one species, P.  
cryptopetala, was shown to be a C 3-C4 intermediate species 
(Voznesenskaya et al., 2010); P . hirsutissima and P . mucronata 
are two other species in this clade which have C3-type carbon 
isotope composition, and from examination of leaf lamina 
of herbarium specimens, an apparent lack of Kranz anatomy 
(Ocampo et al. , 2013 ). Since evolution of C 4 from C 3 spe -
cies is considered a stepwise process with intermediate states 
(Sage et al., 2012), the goal of the present work was to fully 
characterize photosynthesis in species in clade Cryptopetala, 
and to analyze forms of photosynthesis in representative spe-
cies in the under-studied Pilosa clade, which has a form of 
Kranz only found in Portulacaceae ( Voznesenskaya et al. , 
2010) and Aizoaceae (Bohley et al., 2015).
Materials and methods
Plant material
The sources of seeds and plants of species in this study are pro -
vided in Table 1. All seeds were stored at 3–5 ºC prior to use and 
were germinated on the surface of potting soil (Sunshine LC-1 from 
SUNGRO Horticulture, Bellevue, W A, USA) at 25 ºC and a photo-
synthetic photon flux density (PPFD) of 100  µmol quanta m -2 s-1. 
The seedlings were then transplanted to soil in 10 cm diameter pots 
(one seedling per pot). After ~ 1 week established plants were trans-
ferred to a greenhouse with day/night temperatures 26/18  °C and 
a maximum mid-day PPFD of 1000  µmol photosynthetic quanta 
m−2s−1. Plants were fertilized once per week with Peter’s Professional 
(20:20:20; Scotts Miracle-Gro). For microscopy and biochemical 
analyses, samples of mature leaves were taken from ~2-month-old 
plants. Cotyledons were fixed ~2 weeks after germination when the 
first leaves were already established.
Light and electron microscopy
Hand cross sections of fresh leaves were placed in water and stud -
ied under UV light (with DAPI filter) on a Leica Fluorescence 
Microscope Leica DMFSA (Leica Microsystems Wetzlar GmbH, 
Germany).
For structural studies, two to three samples were taken from three 
plants for each species from cotyledons and the middle part of the 
leaf. They were fixed at 4 oC in 2% (v/v) paraformaldehyde and 2% 
(v/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2), postfixed 
in 2% (w/v) OsO 4 and then, after a standard acetone dehydration 
procedure, embedded in Spurr’s epoxy resin. Cross sections were 
made on a Reichert Ultracut R ultramicrotome (Reichert-Jung 
C4 and C3–C4 intermediate photosynthesis in genus Portulaca | 227
GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany). For light microscopy, semi-thin 
sections were stained with 1% (w/v) Toluidine blue O in 1% (w/v) 
Na2B4O7 and studied under the Olympus BH-2 (Olympus Optical 
Co., Ltd.) light microscope equipped with LM Digital Camera & 
Software (Jenoptik ProgRes Camera, C12plus, Jena, Germany). 
Ultra-thin sections were stained for transmission electron micros -
copy with 4% (w/v) uranyl acetate followed by 2% (w/v) lead citrate. 
FEI Tecnai G2 (Field Emission Instruments Company, Hillsboro, 
OR, USA) equipped with Eagle FP 5271/82 4K HR200KV digital 
camera and Hitachi H-600 (Hitachi Scientific Instruments, Tokyo, 
Japan) transmission electron microscopes were used for observation 
and photography.
Observations of vascular pattern were obtained from fully 
expanded leaves. The samples were cleared in 70% ethanol (v/v) 
until chlorophyll was removed, treated with 5% (w/v) NaOH over -
night and then rinsed three times in water. At least five leaves from 
two or three different plants were used. The leaves were mounted 
in water and examined under UV light (with DAPI filter) on a 
Fluorescence Microscope Leica DMFSA (Leica Microsystems 
Wetzlar GmbH, Germany) using autofluorescence of lignified tra -
cheary elements of the xylem. The density of the venation (mm per 
mm2 of the leaf surface area) was determined as the length of minor 
or peripheral veins per leaf area which were measured using the 
image analysis program ImageJ 1.37v (Wayne Rasband, National 
Institutes of Health, USA). Standard errors were determined and 
analysis of variance (ANOV A) was performed with Statistica 7.0 
software (StatSoft, Inc.). Tukey’s HSD (honest significant differ -
ence) test was used to analyze differences between vein density val -
ues in Portulaca species. All analyses were performed at the 95% 
significance level.
In situ immunolocalization
Leaf samples (two to three samples from three plants for each spe -
cies) were fixed at 4 oC in 2% (v/v) paraformaldehyde and 1.25% 
(v/v) glutaraldehyde in 0.05 M PIPES buffer, pH 7.2. The samples 
were dehydrated with a graded ethanol series and embedded in 
London Resin White (LR White, Electron Microscopy Sciences, 
Fort Washington, PA, USA) acrylic resin. The antibody used (raised 
in rabbit) was against the P subunit of mitochondrial glycine decar-
boxylase (GDC) IgG from Pisum sativum L. (courtesy of Dr David 
Oliver). Preimmune serum was used as a control.
For transmission electron microscopy immunolabeling, thin sec -
tions (~70–90 nm) on Formvar-coated nickel grids were incubated 
for 1 h in TBST+BSA to block non-specific protein binding on the 
sections. They were then incubated for 3 h with either the preim -
mune serum diluted in TBST+BSA or anti-GDC (1:10) antibodies. 
After washing with TBST+BSA, the sections were incubated for 1 
h with Protein A-gold (15 nm) diluted 1:100 with TBST+BSA. The 
sections were washed sequentially with TBST+BSA, and TBST and 
distilled water, and then post-stained with a 1:3 dilution of 0.5% 
(w/v) potassium permanganate and 2% (w/v) uranyl acetate. Images 
were collected using a FEI Tecnai G2 transmission electron micro -
scope. The density of labeling was determined by counting the gold 
particles on electron micrographs and calculating the number per 
unit area (µm 2) in the mitochondria, versus background labeling 
density in the rest of the cell. For each cell type, replicate measure -
ments were made on parts of cell sections ( n=10–60 images from at 
least two different experiments).
Western blot analysis
Total proteins were extracted from leaves by homogenizing 0.2 g of tis-
sue in 0.2 ml of extraction buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM 
(w/v) MgCl2, 1 mM (w/v) EDTA, 15mM (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol, 
20% (v/v) glycerol and 1mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride). 
Extraction was continued by adding 0.3 ml 60 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 
4% (w/v) SDS, 20% (v/v) glycerol, 0.5% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol and 
0.1% (w/v) bromphenol blue. After boiling for 5 min for SDS-PAGE 
the supernatant was collected after centrifugation at 14  000  ×g for 
5  min and protein concentration was determined with an RCDC 
protein quantification kit (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA), which

lium and 75 mM 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in detection 
buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2). The 
intensities of bands in western blots were quantified with an image 
analysis program (ImageJ 1.37v) and expressed relative to mean level 
in seven C4 species, which was set at 100%.
Measurements of rates of photosynthesis
Gas exchange was measured using the LI-6400XT portable photo -
synthesis system equipped with broadleaf chamber (LI-6400-02B) 
in response to varying CO2 at 1000 µmol quanta m−2 s−1 PPFD and  
25 ○C and in response to varying light intensity at 400 µbar CO2 and 
25 ○C. Measurements were performed in greenhouse with enclosing 
of one leaf or leaf portion inside of chamber. For each experiment 
the leaves were illuminated with 1000 PPFD under 400 µbar CO2 and 
25 ○C until a steady state rate of CO2 fixation was obtained (generally 
30 min). For varying CO2 experiments the CO2 level was decreased, 
and then increased up to 2000  µbar at 5 min intervals. For varying 
light experiments, measurements were made beginning at 2000 PPFD, 
with decreasing levels at 4 min intervals. The CO2 compensation point 
(Г) was determined by extrapolating the initial slope of CO2 response 
curve through the x-axis and taking the zero intercept. The leaf area 
was calculated from digital image of the leaf portion enclosed in the 
chamber, using an image analysis program (ImageJ 1.37v).
δ13C values
δ13C values, a measure of the carbon isotope composition, were 
determined at Washington State University on leaf samples taken 
from plants using a standard procedure relative to PDB (Pee Dee 
Belemnite) limestone as the carbon isotope standard ( Bender et al., 
1973). Plant samples were dried at 80 °C for 24 h, milled to a fine 
powder and then 1–2 mg were placed into a tin capsule and com -
busted in a Eurovector elemental analyzer. The resulting N 2 and 
CO2 gases were separated by gas chromatography and admitted into 
the inlet of a Micromass Isoprime isotope ratio mass spectrometer 
(IRMS) for determination of 13C/12C ratios. δ13C values were calcu-
lated where δ13C=1000×(Rsample/Rstandard)–1, where R=13C/12C.
C4 biochemical-type evolution
A combined data matrix of chloroplast and nuclear DNA sequences 
was prepared from the data used by Ocampo and Columbus (2010, 
2012) and Ocampo et al. (2013) to obtain an evolutionary framework 
to estimate C4 variant diversification within Portulacaceae. Sampling 
included species of Portulaca with known C 4 biochemical types. 
Sequences were aligned using MUSCLE version 3.7 ( Edgar, 2004), 
followed by manual alignment in MEGA version 7.0.14 ( Kumar 
et  al., 2016 ). The combined data matrix was partitioned by locus 
and analyzed under maximum likelihood (ML; Felsenstein, 1973) in 
RA×ML version 7.2.6 (Stamatakis, 2006) under the GTRGAMMA 
model. Clade support was calculated by nonparametric bootstrap -
ping (Felsenstein, 1985) from 10 000 replicates performed simultane-
ously with the ML search using the ‘-f a’ option. The phylogenetic 
analysis was executed using the High Performance Computing 
Cluster at the California Academy of Sciences. Evolution of C 4 
biochemical types was estimated by ML over the ML tree using 
Mesquite version 3.04 ( Maddison and Maddison, 2016 ) under the 
Markov k-state 1 parameter model (Lewis, 2001).
Results
Carbon isotope composition of leaves
The carbon isotope values of leaves of the three Portulaca spe-
cies in the Crytopetala clade, P . cryptopetala, P . hirsutissima 
and P . mucronata, were all C 3-like (δ13C −26.6 to −28.6 o/oo). 
In all species in the Pilosa clade that were analyzed the values 
were in the range of C4 plants (−12.1 to −17.4o/oo) (Table 1).
General view of plants and leaf structure
Figure 1 shows the general view of representative Portulaca 
species that were analyzed in the most detail in this study. 
Two of the species, P . cryptopetala (Fig. 1A) and P . mucronata 
(Fig. 1D) have flattened leaves, while P . hirsutissima (Fig. 1G) 
has thicker and more succulent terete (terete means succu -
lent circular or distorted circle shape) leaves. All three spe -
cies clearly have C 3-like dorsoventral type of anatomy with 
vascular bundles (VB) situated under the palisade layers, in 
the medium part of leaf lamina between palisade and spongy 
parenchyma (Fig. 1B, C, E, F, H, I). In two species, P . cryp-
topetala and P .  mucronata there are two layers of palisade 
parenchyma on the adaxial side and three to four layers of 
spongy parenchyma cells on the abaxial side; the VB are sur-
rounded by BS cells ( Fig. 1C, F). The general leaf anatomy 
in P . hirsutissima (Fig. 1I) is similar except for the intensive 
development of spongy water storage (WS) parenchyma in 
the middle part of the leaf ( Fig. 1I). In all three species the 
BS cells around lateral VB are rather large; but, their size is 
similar to the surrounding M cells (Fig. 1C, F, I).
In P . cryptopetala and P . mucronata, the main vein is located 
in the same plane as all lateral VBs (not shown); however; in 
P .  hirsutissima the main vein is well below the lateral veins 
and it is surrounded by spongy WS parenchyma (Fig. 1H).
Representative species from the Pilosa clade ( P .  biloba, P . 
cf. gilliesii, P . elatior, P . halimoides, P . smallii and P . suffrute-
scens) have lanceolate semi-terete or cylindrical fleshy leaves 
with Kranz anatomy of Pilosoid type. As illustrated with 
P . elatior (Fig. 1K, L), in this type of anatomy the VB are dis-
tributed around the leaf periphery with each individual vein 
surrounded by two specialized chlorenchyma layers character-
istic of Kranz-type anatomy. The main vein is located more or 
less in the center of the leaf and is surrounded by WS tissue.
Transmission electron microscopy
In three species, P . cryptopetala, P . hirsutissima and P . mucro-
nata, the BS cells contain a significant number of organelles 
in the centripetal position, adjacent to VB and along the 
radial cell walls (Fig. 2A, D, G). M and BS chloroplasts in all 
three species have a similar level of grana development with 
medium-sized grana ( Fig.  2B, C, E, F, H, I). BS cells con -
tain numerous centripetally arranged enlarged mitochondria 
(Fig. 2A, D, G).
C4 and C3–C4 intermediate photosynthesis in genus Portulaca | 229
In all six species with Pilosoid Kranz-type leaf anatomy, 
the BS cells surrounding the minor veins contain numerous 
organelles in a centripetal position (illustrated in P . smallii and 
P .  elatior, Fig.  2J, M). A  more detailed study of M and BS 
ultrastructure revealed significant differences. In five species 
(P . biloba, P . cf. gilliesii, P . halimoides, P . smallii and P . suffrute-
scens), the BS cells contain nearly agranal chloroplasts while 
M chloroplasts have rather well-developed grana as shown for 
P . smallii in Fig. 2K, L. However, one species, P . elatior, has a 
reverse type of chloroplast ultrastructure; the chloroplasts in 
the BS cells have numerous mid-sized grana ( Fig. 2N) while 
the M chloroplasts have a more extensive single thylakoid sys-
tem (Fig. 2O). This species also has numerous large mitochon-
dria with specific tubular cristae in BS cells (Fig. 2N).
Vein density
The vein density in the three species in the Cryptopetala clade 
(P . cryptopetala, P . hirsutissima and P . mucronata) which lack 
Kranz anatomy was analyzed in comparison to Kranz-type 
species including P . umbraticola with Atriplicoid leaf anatomy 
from Umbraticola clade, two species in the Oleracea clade with 
modified Atriplicoid-type anatomy (P . molokiniensis and two 
varieties of P . oleracea) and three species in the Pilosa clade with 
Pilosoid-type anatomy (P . amilis, P . biloba and P . grandiflora) 
(Fig. 3). Among these, in general species in the Cryptopetala 
clade had the lowest vein density while the highest vein densi-
ties were in the two species in the Oleracea clade (vein density 
~1.8-fold higher than the Cryptopetala species). In the species 
in the Pilosa clade, the vein densities on the adaxial side of 
leaves were on average ~1.3-fold higher than the Cryptopetala 
species. Portulaca umbraticola had high vein density, appear -
ing to be intermediate between Pilosa and Oleracea clades. The 
three species with Pilosoid Kranz-type leaf anatomy showed 
similar vein densities on the adaxial leaf side while the densities 
in the two species with flattened leaves (P . amilis and P . biloba) 
were 1.2 and 1.7 times lower on the abaxial leaf side.
Cotyledon anatomy
The species in the Cryptopetala clade, P . cryptopetala, P . hir-
sutissima and P .  mucronata, have cotyledons with C 3-like 
Fig. 1. General view of Portulaca species (left panels, A, D, G, J), distribution of chlorenchyma under the fluorescent microscope (middle panels, B, E, H, 
K), and light microscopy of leaf cross sections (right panels, C, F, I, L). P . cryptopetala (B, C), P . mucronata (E, F) and P . hirsutissima (H, I), all have C3 like 
dorsoventral type leaf anatomy. In P . cryptopetala and P . mucronata (B, C, E, F), all vascular bundles (VB), including the main vein, are distributed in the 
median paradermal plane; red fluorescence from chlorophyll is distributed more or less evenly through the leaf mesophyll (B, E). In P . hirsutissima (H, I), 
VB are positioned close to the adaxial side while the main vein is in the center of the leaf below lateral veins; red chlorophyll fluorescence is concentrated 
in the adaxial palisade mesophyll layers with water storage (WS) spongy mesophyll cells in the middle of the leaf (H). P . elatior has Pilosoid type of 
anatomy (K, L) with peripheral distribution of VB with each vein surrounded by two Kranz chlorenchyma layers; WS tissue is around the main vein. VB, 
vascular bundles; WS, water storage tissue. Scale bars: 1 mm for B; 200 µm for C, F, I, L; 0.5 mm for E, H, K.

dorsoventral anatomy, with one to two layers of palisade-like 
M cells on the adaxial side and several layers of spongy M 
cells towards the abaxial side ( Fig.  4A–C). The number of 
spongy parenchyma layers varies between species: from one 
or two layers in P . cryptopetala and P . mucronata to mostly 
three in semi-terete cotyledons of P . hirsutissima with a little 
thicker mid-section. VB are distributed in a lateral plane in 
the central part of the lamina in P . cryptopetala and P . mucro-
nata (Fig. 4A, C) and they are located closer to the adaxial 
side of the lamina under the palisade parenchyma in P . hir-
sutissima (Fig. 4B). In all three species the VB are surrounded 
by rather large BS cells with a higher density of organelles

(chloroplasts and mitochondria) in the centripetal position or 
along the radial cell walls, similar to that described for leaves 
(structural analysis by TEM is not shown).
The cotyledons in five studied species in the Pilosa clade 
with Kranz-type anatomy in leaves (P . biloba, P . elatior, P . hal-
imoides, P . smallii and P . suffrutescens) all have Atriplicoid-
like Kranz anatomy with VB distributed in one lateral plane 
(illustrated only for P . elatior and P . smallii, Fig. 4D, E). The 
VB surrounded by two layers of Kranz chlorenchyma are 
located under the adaxial epidermis, with variable number 
of spongy parenchyma layers towards the abaxial epidermis, 
from one layer in P . elatior to mostly two layers in P . biloba, 
P . halimoides and P . suffrutescens. In P . smallii the VB are 
located closer to the adaxial side of the lamina with three/
four layers of spongy parenchyma cells on the adaxial side of 
the cotyledon (Fig. 4E).
Immunolabeling for GDC
In situ immunolabeling for GDC was performed for P . cryp-
topetala, P . hirsutissima and P . mucronata in the Cryptopetala 
clade in comparison to the C 4 species P .  oleracea ( Fig.  5; 
Supplementary Fig. S1 at JXB online). Analysis of the den -
sity of immunogold particles for anti-GDC antibody shows 
strong selective localization in BS mitochondria (~10-fold 
higher than in M mitochondria) in P . oleracea. Similarly, in 
all three species, P . cryptopetala, P . hirsutissima and P . mucro-
nata, there is clear selective labeling for GDC in BS mito -
chondria ( Fig.  5). Supplementary Fig. S1 shows electron 
microscopy images of the immunolabeling for anti-GDC 
antibody, where it is selectively localized in BS mitochondria 
in P .  oleracea and the C 3-C4 intermediates, while in the C 3 
species Sesuvium portulacastrum  there is similar density of 
labeling in mitochondria in M and BS cells (Fig. 5).
Western blot analysis
Immunoblots are shown for photosynthetic enzymes of the C4 
cycle, PEPC, PPDK, NAD-ME and NADP-ME, from total 
proteins extracted from leaves of Portulaca species ( Fig. 6). 
In the three species in the Cryptopetala clade, ( P .  crypto-
petala, P . hirsutissima and P . mucronata) the labeling for C 4 
cycle enzymes PEPC and PPDK was much lower than in the 
other species all of which have Kranz anatomy. Analyses of 
the relative band densities (measured by Image J) showed the 
density of labeling in the intermediates for PEPC was 7–15% 
and for PPDK was 14–20% compared to the mean value for 
the seven C4 species. The three species from the Cryptopetala 
clade had lower labeling for NAD-ME-type enzyme com -
pared to the NAD-ME species P .  elatior and P .  oleracea, 
and no detectable labeling for NADP-ME ( Fig. 6). Among 
the other species, five are in the Pilosa clade ( P . biloba, P . cf. 
gilliesii, P .  elatior, P .  halimoides, P .  smallii and P .  suffrutes-
cens), while the other, P .  oleracea, is in the Oleracea clade. 
With respect to C4 decarboxylases, all species from the Pilosa 
clade have high labeling for NADP-ME with the exception of 
Fig. 3. Graph showing the density of venation in representative Portulaca 
species. For two species, P . amilis and P . biloba, vein density is shown 
for both sides of the leaf, adaxial and abaxial (ada and aba on graph). For 
P . oleracea, two accessions were studied: *, seeds from Pullman, WA, 
USA; and **, seeds from USDA PI 0121921. n≥10. Different letters indicate 
significant differences between species and leaf sides, P≤0.05.

Gas exchange analysis
Gas exchange analyses were made to compare photosynthetic 
features of species in the Cryptopetala clade with a represent-
ative C4 species, P . oleracea. The response of photosynthesis 
to varying intercellular levels of CO 2 were measured under 
1000 PPFD, 25 ºC and atmospheric O 2 (21%). With increas-
ing levels of CO2, there was a rapid increase in photosynthesis 
in P . oleracea with near saturation at ~200 μbar CO2, whereas 
P . cryptopetala, P . hirsutissima and P . mucronata show strong 
a continual increase in photosynthesis up to 800–1000 µbar 
CO2 with very similar rates under high CO2 (Fig. 7A). When 
photosynthesis was measured under near current atmos -
pheric levels of CO 2, 400 μbar (with resulting C i values 
~200–250 µbar), the rate of photosynthesis was higher in P.  
oleracea than in the other three species. The CO 2 compensa-
tion points ( Γ) determined from extrapolation of the initial 
slopes of the response curve, was 2.6 μbar for P . oleracea, 
while values in the Cryptopetala species P . cryptopetala and 
P . hirsutissima were ~ 30 μbar, and in P . mucronata Γ was 20 
μbar (Fig. 7B). In light response curves, at 400 µbar CO2 and 
25 ºC, the response of photosynthesis was similar among the 
species (Fig. 7C). In the Cryptopetala species photosynthesis 
reaches saturated rates at ~1100 PPFD while there was some 
marginal increase in rates in P . oleracea up to 2000 PPFD. 
The maximum rates at 2000 PPFD in P . hirsutissima and P.  
mucronata were similar, and significantly (P<0.05) lower than 
in P . cryptopetala and P . oleracea (Fig. 7C).
Evolution of C4 biochemical types
The sampling for the phylogenetic analysis included 16 
Portulaca species with known C 4 biochemical types (see 
Voznesenskaya et al., 2010; Ocampo et al., 2013; this study) 
and three representatives of close-related taxa as outgroup 
(Table  2 ). Relationships within Portulaca follow those 
obtained by Ocampo and Columbus (2012), where the genus 
and the relations among major clades are well supported 
(Fig.  8). The analysis shows the NADP-ME biochemical 
variant is the ancestral C 4 type for Portulaca. It predicts 
that there were two independent switches to the NAD-ME 
type, one in the ancestor of the Oleracea clade and one in 
P . elatior (earliest divergent lineage of the Pilosa clade). The 
C3-C4 condition originated only once in the ancestor of the 
Cryptopetala clade.
Discussion
In this study on species which belong to the AL clade of 
Portulaca, the focus was on clades Pilosa and Cryptopetala. 
Portulaca biloba, P . cf. gilliesii, P . elatior, P . halimoides, P . smal-
lii and P . suffrutescens are from the Pilosa clade, and they all 
have C4-type carbon isotope ratios (this study; Ocampo et al., 
2013). The discovery that this clade has not only NADP-ME 
species, but also an NAD-ME type C 4 ( P .  elatior, which is 
widely distributed from the Caribbean to Venezuela and 
Brazil) provides insight into diversity in evolution of forms 
of C 4 in the genus. The Cryptopetala clade, which is com -
posed of P . cryptopetala, P . hirsutissima and P . mucronata, is 
the only lineage that has species with C3-type carbon isotope 
ratios (Table 1, Ocampo et al., 2013); in this study all three 
species are shown to be C3-C4 intermediates.
Evolutionary trends in anatomy
Leaf anatomy
Among the three intermediate Portulaca species in the 
Cryptopetala clade, P .  cryptopetala and P .  mucronata are 
sister species, while P . hirsutissima is an early-divergent (see 
Fig. 8). The former two species have rather succulent, flattened 
leaves, while P .  hirsutissima has terete leaves with a thicker 
central part. This is consistent with differences in structure: 
P . cryptopetala and P . mucronata have broad leaves with VB

Numbers at the right indicate molecular mass in kilodaltons. The originals 
were modified to group species according to the presentation (vertical 
lines); there were no selective changes in positions or densities of bands 
on the membrane. The reason for labeling of two bands in some species 
with the antibody for NAD-ME (prepared against A. hypochondriacus 
α-NAD-ME) is not known. It may represent the expression of two isoforms 
of the α-NAD-ME, or the antibody may have low reactivity with the smaller 
subunit β-NAD-ME in some species (see Murata et al., 1989; Tronconi 
et al., 2008; Maier et al., 2011).

distributed in one plane, while P . hirsutissima differs in having 
semi-terete leaves with all lateral VBs distributed under the 
adaxial epidermis and the main vein underneath, surrounded 
by WS. In P . cryptopetala and P . mucronata the distribution 
of VB is similar to the C 4 species in the Umbraticola clade 
having Atriplicoid Kranz-anatomy, while in P .  hirsutissima 
the leaf anatomy resembles the Portulacelloid-type Kranz-
anatomy found in the Australian clade C4 species (see Fig. 8 
for anatomical types).
Most of the C 3-C4 intermediate species found in differ -
ent dicot lineages have a general leaf structural pattern that 
resembles closely related C 4 species. Most of them have 
flattened dorsoventral or isopalisade leaves with enlarged 
BS cells. This type of anatomy in flattened leaves is charac -
teristic for C 3-C4 intermediates in genera Flaveria (Holaday 
et al., 1984b) and Parthenium  (Moore et al., 1987) in family 
Asteraceae, in Euphorbia  in family Euphorbiaceae ( Sage et 
al., 2011), Heliotropium  in family Boraginaceae ( Muhaidat 
et al. , 2011 ), and Alternantera  in family Amaranthaceae 
(Rajendrudu et al., 1986). They have Kranz-like Atriplicoid-
type anatomy as the most advanced stage of evolution from 
intermediates towards C 4. This includes several species with 
C4-like photosynthesis ( Flaveria brownii, Cheng et al., 1988) 
and two intermediate Heliotropium  species with Kranz-like

by low to high levels of CO2). In panel C, the results represent the average of 2–4 replications from measurements made on different leaves (averages 
were taken from results obtained with changes from high to low light intensity).

(Apel and Ohle, 1979 ; Holaday and Chollet, 1984 a) and 
Diplotaxis  (Ueno et al., 2003) also have intermediate species 
with similar type of anatomy in flattened leaves; but there 
are no known C 4 relatives in family Brassicaceae. In fam -
ily Cleomaceae, the С3-С4 intermediate Cleome paradoxa  
has flattened leaves with isopalisade anatomy with all VB 
distributed in one plane, Atriplicoid-like ( Voznesenskaya 
et al., 2007). It was suggested to be closer phylogenetically 
to C 4 C. angustifolia  which has Glossocardioid Kranz-
type leaf anatomy; nevertheless, the phylogenetic position 
of this species is not far from C 4 Cleome ( Gynandropsis ) 
gynandra with Atriplicoid-type leaf anatomy ( Feodorova et 
al., 2010).
In considering intermediates and forms of Kranz in 
families Chenopodiaceae and Portulacaceae, there is large

C4 and C3–C4 intermediate photosynthesis in genus Portulaca | 235
diversity in C 4 from Atriplicoid type to forms of Kranz 
with VB distributed around WS tissue in succulent leaves. In 
Chenopodiaceae, the type of leaf anatomy in the C3-C4 inter-
mediate Sedobassia sedoides  resembles the Kranz Kochioid 
type in C 4 Bassia in the positioning of veins with respect 
to WS tissue and the positioning of BS cells with respect 
to VB where they are distributed only on the outer side of 
the lateral VB ( Freitag and Kadereit, 2014 ). Also, Kranz-
like Sympegmoid and Kranz-like Salsoloid are C 3-C4 inter-
mediate types of leaf anatomy found in Salsola s.l. species, 
which resemble Kranz Salsoloid-type in peripheral distribu -
tion of M and positioning of minor veins in a circular pat -
tern around WS tissue in succulent leaves ( Voznesenskaya et 
al., 2013; Schüßler et al., in press ). In the present study, the 
leaf anatomy in C 3-C4 intermediate Portulaca species follow 
this trend in showing Atriplicoid-like and Portulacelloid-like 
types of anatomy with related C 4 species having these forms 
of Kranz anatomy.
Cotyledon anatomy
The three Cryptopetala species, which are shown to have 
C3-C4 intermediate type of anatomy in leaves, all have a 
similar dorsoventral type of anatomy in cotyledons with 
centripetally arranged organelles in BS cells. In one species, 
P .  hirsutissima, the VB are distributed close to the adaxial 
epidermis, with greater number of WS spongy parenchyma 
layers towards the abaxial side, compared to other species 
with VB distributed in the central lateral plane of the lamina. 
In closely related families Cleomaceae and Brassicaceae, the 
C3-C4 intermediates Cleome paradoxa and Moricandia arven-
sis also have cotyledons with C 3-C4 intermediate anatomy 
(Rylott et  al., 1998 ; Koteyeva et  al., 2011 ). In other inter -
mediate species (e.g. Salsola and Sedobassia sedoides , fam -
ily Chenopodiaceae), the cotyledons have C 3-type anatomy 
(Voznesenskaya, Koteyeva, unpublished data). In species 
where the cotyledons also have intermediate phenotype, this 
could be advantageous in climates where seedlings are more 
prone to losses due to photorespiration (warmer climates). 
In general, intermediate species having C3- versus C3-C4-type 
photosynthesis in cotyledons may be an example of het -
erobathmy (Takhtajan, 1959), a phenomenon which results 
in unequal levels of specialization of different parts of one 
organism or taxon, achieved during the process of biological 
evolution.
In five species analyzed in the Pilosa clade, which have 
Pilosoid Kranz-type in leaves, the cotyledons all have 
Atriplicoid-like Kranz anatomy with some differences in 
shape and number of WS spongy layers on the abaxial side. 
Thus cotyledons in P .  elatior, P .  biloba, P .  halimoides and 
P . suffrutescens have classical Atriplicoid-type anatomy with 
all Kranz-units (VB surrounded by two layers of chloren -
chyma, characteristic for C 4 species, see Peter and Katinas, 
2003) distributed in a central plane and one or two layers of 
spongy parenchyma on the adaxial side. However, in coty -
ledons of P .  smallii, all Kranz-units are distributed under 
the adaxial epidermis with several layers of WS spongy 
parenchyma underneath. It is easy to imagine that this type 
of structure could represent a transitional step between 
flat-leaved cotyledons with Atriplicoid anatomy to the 
Pilosoid anatomy characteristic of that in leaves of P . smallii. 
In a previous study, P . amilis and P . grandiflora in the Pilosa 
clade, P . umbraticola in the Umbraticola clade and P . olera-
cea in the Oleracea clade were shown to have Atriplicoid-
like anatomy in cotyledons; however, P. cf. bicolor in the 
OL clade, has, as in leaves, Portulacelloid type anatomy in 
the cotyledons ( Voznesenskaya et  al., 2010 ). In general, all 
Portulaca species examined having Kranz-type anatomy in 
leaves, also have Kranz anatomy in the cotyledons. As noted 
by Voznesenskaya et al. (2010), in C 4 dicots that have been 
analyzed in other families, the anatomy and type of photo -
synthesis in cotyledons has often been found to be similar to 
leaves. However, there is diversity with some Kochia species 
having Kochioid-type anatomy in leaves and Atriplicoid-type 
anatomy in cotyledons and with some Salsola species having 
Salsoloid-type anatomy in leaves with Atriplicoid-type anat-
omy in cotyledons ( Pyankov et al., 1999a, 2000); and some 
chenopods having Kranz anatomy and C 4 photosynthesis 
in leaves, with cotyledons having C 3-type anatomy and bio -
chemistry (Pyankov et al., 1999b, 2000; Voznesenskaya et al., 
1999; Lauterbach et al., 2016). These variations are of inter -
est in considering genetic factors that control differences in 
forms of anatomy and biochemistry that develop in C 4 dicot 
leaves versus cotyledons.
Trends in venation density in leaves
Adaptation of plants to arid environments is often accom -
panied by an increase in vein density; at the same time it 
was shown that in most cases vein density decreased with 
increasing succulence, which is the second structural and/or 
functional way of plant adaptation to aridity ( Ogburn and 
Edwards, 2013). Both forms of adaptation likely occurred in 
evolution of types of Kranz anatomy in C 4 species of fami -
lies Chenopodiaceae and Portulacaceae. Together with the 
tendency to decrease leaf surface area to volume ratio, most 
succulents have subterete to terete leaves (more or less round-
ish in cross section). This leaf shape is often accompanied 
by development of a 3D type of venation. This pattern helps 
to maintain the most balanced hydraulic pathway to sup -
port photosynthesis by a closer position of veins to chlor -
enchyma, with a decrease in the path from the vein to leaf 
surface in thick succulent leaves (Ogburn and Edwards, 2009, 
2013). Increased vein density is considered to be one of the 
crucial factors in the evolution of C4 photosynthesis in many 
dicot and grass lineages ( Sage et  al., 2012). However, stud-
ies of venation in representative Salsola species with different 
types of photosynthesis showed there is no significant differ -
ence between C3, C3-C4 intermediates and C 4 species in vein 
density, while there is a clear increase in volume of WS tissue 
(Voznesenskaya et al., 2013).
All Portulaca species have succulent leaves that differ in 
thickness, shape and type of anatomy. In C 4 Portulaca lin -
eages there are differences in vein density along with varia -
tion in the pattern of vein distribution in different anatomical 
types, with the highest density in species having Atriplicoid 
anatomy.
236 | Voznesenskaya et al.
In intermediate Portulaca species, the vein density is about 
2–2.3 times lower than in some other intermediate species 
including Cleome paradoxa ( Marshall et  al., 2007 ), several 
Flaveria intermediates ( McKown and Dengler, 2007 ) and 
Salsola divaricata (Voznesenskaya et al., 2013). This may be 
explained by the Portulaca intermediates having much larger 
cells in succulent leaves.
In this study, most of the C 4 Portulaca species have higher 
vein density compared to three intermediate species. The 
species with Atriplicoid type of anatomy from both clades 
Umbraticola and Oleracea, have the highest vein density 
among all studied Portulaca types (see Fig.  3). Thus in the 
С4 Oleracea species, which have modified zig-zag Atriplicoid 
pattern of venation, the vein densities are ~1.8-fold higher 
than in the Cryptopetala intermediates ( Fig. 3) and are very 
close to that published for flat-leaved C 4 Cleome gynandra  
(Marshall et al., 2007); however, the densities in the Oleracea 
species is ~1.5 times lower than in C4 Flaveria (McKown and 
Dengler, 2007). In C 4 Pilosa species, which have peripheral 
vein distribution around terete or slightly flattened leaves 
with WS tissue in the middle, the vein densities were lowest 
among the C 4 types analyzed. Compared to the intermedi -
ates, the vein densities on the adaxial side of the Pilosa species 
were ~1.3-fold higher than in the Cryptopetala intermediates, 
while the vein densities on the abaxial side of Pilosa species 
was similar to that in Cryptopetala intermediates. The Pilosa 
species may have a lower vein density than the Oleracea spe-
cies, by having a higher volume of WS tissue and decrease in 
chlorenchyma tissue.
In contrast to the absence of clear correlation between vein 
density and the type of photosynthesis in succulent Salsola 
species ( Voznesenskaya et al. , 2013 ), in most C 4 Portulaca 
lineages the vein density is higher than in the intermediates. 
However, among C4 lineages the vein density depends on the 
leaf anatomical type, with different patterns of minor veins 
distribution and/or forms of leaf succulence. In addition, in 
family Anacampserotaceae, which is closely related to the 
Portulacaceae, there is a C3 species Anacampseros (Grahamia) 
coahuilensis (with weak Crasulacean acid metabolism, 
Guralnik et al., 2008) that has the same degree of succulence 
as P . cryptopetala, while its vein density is similar to that 
of C 4 species in the Umbraticola and Pilosa (adaxial side) 
clades (5.0 ± 0.1 mm mm −2; Voznesenskaya and Koteyeva, 
unpublished data). This further supports the understand -
ing that vein density in succulent lineages is more related 
to species-specific adaptations than to a progression change 
from C3 to C4 (Voznesenskaya et al., 2013). Further analyses 
of leaf structure of different photosynthetic phenotypes in 
Portulaca, including vein density, volume of WS tissue and 
chlorenchyma tissue is needed to consider anatomical adap -
tations to arid environments.
Evolutionary trends in types of photosynthesis
In the study of species in clade Cryptopetala, a variety of 
P .  cryptopetala from Uruguay was analyzed ( Table  1) in 
comparison to a variety from Argentina that was previously 
shown to be a C 3-C4 intermediate species ( Voznesenskaya 
et al., 2010). While there are differences in plant morphology 
(the size of the plant, thickness and size of the stems and 
leaves, the size of flowers), the variety used in the current study 
also has a similar dorsoventral leaf anatomy. Analysis of the 
other species in the Cryptopetala clade, P .  hirsutissima and 
P . mucronata, showed they also have C3-C4 anatomy with dor-
soventral distribution of chlorenchyma. Microscopy studies 
show that BS cells in all three species have a substantial num-
ber of organelles with chloroplasts and enlarged mitochon -
dria located mainly in a centripetal position. Measurements 
by gas exchange showed the values of Г in these three 
Cryptopetala species (20–32  μbar CO 2) indicate function -
ally they are intermediates compared to the representative C4 
species P . oleracea, which has a C 4-type Γ value (2.6  μbar). 
Also, P . cryptopetala (variety from Argentina) has a Γ, which 
is intermediate to C 3 (outgroup species Sesuvium portulacas-
trum) and C4 Portulaca (Voznesenskaya et al., 2010). C4 spe-
cies typically have Г values of 0–5  μbar, C3 species ~60 μbar, 
and C3-C4 intermediates of 9–35  µbar depending on the spe-
cies, e.g. Ku et al. (1991), Vogan et al. (2007).
The model for evolution of C4 plants developed from stud-
ies of species having reduced photorespiration consists of a 
stepwise progression of structural, biochemical and func -
tional changes from C 3 through stages of development of 
intermediates having a C 2 cycle, followed by intermediates 
having increased acquisition of the C 4 cycle, to fully func -
tional C 4 photosynthesis ( Sage et al. , 2012 ; Voznesenskaya 
et al., 2013; Schulze et al., 2016). In the C 2 cycle photores -
piratory glycine produced in M cells is shuttled to BS cells 
for decarboxylation by GDC where photorespired CO 2 is 
concentrated, enhancing its capture by BS Rubisco. In all 
three Cryptopetala species, GDC is selectively localized in 
mitochondria of BS cells, which is a distinguishing bio -
chemical feature of intermediate species, while in C 3 spe -
cies the labeling is distributed about equally between M and 
BS mitochondria ( Rawsthorne et  al., 1988 ). Analyses by 
western blots of C 4 pathway enzymes showed that PEPC, 
PPDK and NAD-ME were detectable in all three interme -
diate species in the Cryptopetala clade, but in much lower 
levels compared to the C 4 species. Also, Voznesenskaya 
et al. (2010) found the levels of these C 4 enzymes in P . cryp-
topetala (variety from Argentina) were low, similar to the 
C3 species S. portulacastrum.  The results suggest the capac -
ity for C4 cycle activity in intermediates in this clade is low, 
which is consistent with leaf biomass having C 3-like car -
bon isotope values. Thus, when CO 2 is limiting they may 
have an increase in their efficiency of photosynthesis pri -
marily by refixing photorespired CO 2 in BS cells by the C 2 
cycle, with restricted contribution by a C 4 cycle ( Edwards 
and Ku, 1987 ; Ku et  al., 1991 ; Rawsthorne and Bauwe, 
1998). Whether there is any C4 cycle activity in these species 
could be more directly analysed by the method of Alonso-
Cantabrana and von Caemmerer (2016)  via online measure-
ments of photosynthesis and carbon isotope discrimination. 
The lack of identification of C 3 and other species that could 
represent the proposed progression in C 4 evolution in the 
genus Portulaca could suggest they have become extinct or 
have not yet been discovered.
C4 and C3–C4 intermediate photosynthesis in genus Portulaca | 237
All the Portulaca species in the study from the Pilosa clade 
were shown to have Kranz-type Pilosoid anatomy. One of 
them, P . biloba, has flattened subterete leaves while P. cf. 
gilliesii, P . elatior, P . halimoides and P . smallii have cylindri-
cal terete leaves. In these species, the lateral VB with Kranz 
anatomy are distributed around the leaf periphery; while the 
main vein, which lacks a chlorenchyma sheath, is enclosed by 
WS tissue located in the central part of the leaf. That type of 
structure was classified as having multiple simple Kranz units 
(with many separate VB surrounded by two layers of Kranz 
tissue) according to classification by Peter and Katinas (2003). 
A similar leaf anatomy was shown for other representatives of 
this clade (Voznesenskaya et al., 2010; Ocampo et al., 2013). 
Some species in this clade were previously shown to have 
NADP-ME type of C 4 biochemistry ( Voznesenskaya et al. , 
2010); in the present study additional species were shown to 
be NADP-ME type with one exception. Portulaca elatior, with 
Pilosoid leaf anatomy, was shown to have NAD-ME type of 
biochemistry, and it represents the earliest-divergent lineage 
of the Pilosa clade. This was surprising, since NAD-ME sub-
type was previously associated only with the Oleracea clade 
while all other C 4 Portulaca were considered NADP-ME 
subtype ( Voznesenskaya et al. , 2010 ). The results suggest 
NAD-ME type of C 4 biochemistry evolved twice within 
Portulaca, once in the Oleracea clade and once in P . elatior 
(Pilosa clade). It suggests evolution of different forms of C 4 
is more complex than previously thought. This discovery is 
consistent with the hypothesis that all photosynthetic modifi-
cations within Portulaca, including C3-C4 intermediates, were 
probably derived from C4 NADP-ME type based on phyloge-
netic analyses (Fig. 8 and Ocampo et al., 2013). Previously it 
was shown the dominant form of photosynthesis in Portulaca 
is C4, which was possibly lost in species in the Cryptopetala 
clade. Similar cases, where intermediates are nested within C4 
species, were shown for some clades in Aizoaceae ( Bohley et 
al., 2015) and Salsoleae (Schüßler et al., in press); which might 
be other cases where reversions from C4 to intermediates or C3 
occurred. This is in contrast to studies in some families, which 
support evolution from C3-C4 intermediates to C4 photosyn-
thesis (see Leaf anatomy in evolutionary trends section, this 
paper, and Sage et al., 2012, 2014). Other studies suggest that 
a C3-C4 ancestor may have given rise to different C4 biochemi-
cal forms independently in separate lineages (e.g. Christin et 
al., 2011). This may have been in response to specific envi -
ronmental conditions, although the adaptive advantages of 
the different C4 variations are not well known. Careful large-
scale analyses of the distribution of C3-C4 species and closely 
related C3 and C 4 lineages showed it is impossible to define 
a universal ecological C 3-C4 niche, nevertheless between dif -
ferent ecological factors temperature is one of the most 
important driving forces ( Lundgren and Christin, in press ). 
Likewise, the diversity within Portulaca could be facilitated 
by development of different photosynthesis strategies in sepa-
rate lineages from unknown C 3-C4 intermediate ancestors; 
although there is no evidence to support this. Gas exchange 
analyses indicate the C3-C4 intermediates (which have the CO2 
concentrating C2 cycle) would be less capable of maintain -
ing their photosynthesis under CO 2 limited conditions than 
C4 species, which have the CO 2 concentrating C4 cycle. Both 
intermediates and different Kranz forms of C4 Portulaca have 
been found to grow together in some locations ( Ocampo et 
al., 2013). Further studies may help to clarify photosynthetic 
diversification in the different lineages of Portulaca, including 
the potential adaptive advantage of each phenotype based on 
habitat and seasonal growth cycles.
