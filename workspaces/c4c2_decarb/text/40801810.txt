Abstract
Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) is involved in the conversion 
of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to oxaloacetate (OAA). In addition to playing a 
role in gluconeogenesis in various organisms, PEPCK also functions in the C4 
cycle to concentrate CO2 for photosynthesis in some C 4 plants. Brown algae 
harbor genes related to the C4 cycle, including the PEPCK gene, and are pro-
posed to employ a C4 cycle- like pathway. However, little is known about the CO2- 
concentrating mechanisms and the properties of the enzymes involved in brown 
algae. Here, we obtained soluble recombinant PEPCKs of five brown algae and 
carried out biochemical analyses. The five PEPCKs were ATP- dependent and 
displayed similar or higher specific activities compared with their counterparts 
from other organisms. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase from Ishige oka-
murae (Io- PEPCK) exhibited the highest specific activity in both carboxylation 
and decarboxylation directions, with values of 48.4 and 63.3 μmol · min−1 · mg−1, 
respectively. Additionally, Io- PEPCK displayed a kcat/KmHCO3 value of 9.2 × 103 · 
M−1 · s−1, much higher than those of previously characterized PEPCKs. The re-
sponse of PEPCK activity to various metabolites showed that citrate and malate 
inhibited the carboxylation but promoted the decarboxylation activity of Io - 
PEPCK. Various ATP concentrations resulted in different degrees of inhibition on 
the carboxylation activity of PEPCK, suggesting that ATP concentration poten-
tially regulates PEPCK activity in brown algae. The analysis of cell extracts from 
I. okamurae suggested that PEPCK rather than PEPC dominates the carboxyla-
tion in this brown alga. Based on previous knowledge and the results presented 
here, a model for a C4 cycle- like pathway in brown algae has been proposed.

INTRODUCTION
The carbon sequestered by coastal vegetated ecosys -
tems is known as “blue carbon” and is increasingly being 
positioned as a practical climate change mitigation 
measure (Duarte et al.,  2013; Nellemann et al.,  2009). 
Macroalgae in these ecosystems have particularly high 
carbon sequestration capacities, so marine coastal 
ecosystems with macroalgae as primary producers, 
which are called “macroalgal forests,” have recently 
1322 |   
JIN et al.
been identified as one of the largest contributors to car-
bon sequestration on Earth (Duarte et al., 2013; Duarte 
et  al., 2022; Griscom et  al.,  2017; Krause-  Jensen & 
Duarte, 2016; Pessarrodona et al.,  2023). It has been 
estimated that 61 to 268 Tg (1012 g) of carbon per year 
is sequestered in deep sea and coastal soil (Krause- 
Jensen & Duarte,  2016). Efforts have been made to 
model the pathways of carbon sequestered by macroal-
gal ecosystems and to develop methods to accurately 
assess their fluxes in order to incorporate this blue car-
bon into an international carbon trading framework.
Carbon dioxide fixation in organisms, includ -
ing plants, algae, and cyanobacteria, is carried out 
through the function of ribulose-  1,5- bisphosphate 
carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) and the Calvin–
Benson–Bassham (CBB) cycle. In many organisms, 
CO2- concentrating mechanisms (CCMs) are also pres-
ent, providing a high concentration of CO2 to RuBisCO 
(Koch et al.,  2013; Maberly & Gontero,  2017; Meyer & 
Griffiths,  2013; Raven & Giordano,  2017). The CCMs 
are broadly classified into biophysical CCMs and bio -
chemical CCMs (Maberly & Gontero,  2017; Raven & 
Giordano,  2017). Biophysical CCMs consist of active 
transport and interconversion of CO 2 and HCO 3
− by 
transporters and carbonic anhydrase activities and 
condensation of enzymes such as RuBisCO by the for-
mation of carboxysomes and pyrenoids. Biochemical 
CCMs contain metabolic pathways, such as those 
found in C 4 photosynthesis and crassulacean acid 
metabolism (CAM). In C4 plants, initial fixation of atmo-
spheric CO 2 occurs in mesophyll cells by phosphoe -
nolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), converting CO 2 and 
phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to oxaloacetate (OAA) in 
an irreversible manner. Oxaloacetate is then converted 
to malate (Figure S1a) or aspartate ( Figure S1b,c) and 
transported to bundle-  sheath cells, in which they are 
converted so that CO 2 is released and can be pro -
vided to RuBisCO. C 4 cycles are classified into three 
subtypes based on the different decarboxylation 
modes or enzymes used to release CO 2: NADP- malic 
enzyme type ( Figure  S1a), NAD-  malic enzyme type 
(Figure  S1b), and PEP carboxykinase (PEPCK) type 
(Figure S1c; Furbank,  2011, 2016; Rao & Dixon,  2016; 
Wang et al., 2014). The NADP- malic enzyme type me -
tabolism stores the C4 compounds as malate, whereas 
the other two types store the C 4 compounds as aspar -
tate (Figure S1). Regardless of the enzyme that carries 
out decarboxylation, PEPC is the enzyme responsible 
for the initial carboxylation in the CCM of C 4 plants.
Carbon concentration mechanisms are also pre -
sumed to function in macroalgae, particularly in brown 
algae (Phaeophyceae; Koch et  al.,  2013; Maberly 
& Gontero,  2017; Meyer & Griffiths,  2013; Raven & 
Giordano, 2017). The apparent function of CCMs has 
been observed in a wide range of brown algae, but 
this is not necessarily the case in red algae (Stepien 
et  al.,  2016). Although CCMs require energy, active 
CO2 uptake by the underwater algae is important for 
their RuBisCOs to reach full potential. The average 
dissolved CO 2 concentration in seawater (15 μM) is 
thought to be insufficient to inhibit the oxygenase ac -
tivity of RuBisCO in brown algae, and the gas diffu -
sion rate of CO 2 in water is very slow (1/10,000 of that 
in the atmosphere, 2 × 10−9 m2 · s−1 1 atm 25°C; Koch 
et al., 2013; Maberly & Gontero, 2017; Oh et al., 2023). 
Indeed, an inverse correlation has been observed be -
tween the efficiency of CCMs and the CO 2 fixation 
efficiency of RuBisCO among algae, suggesting that 
CCMs influence the kinetic evolution of their RuBisCOs 
(Capó- Bauçà et  al., 2023; Capó-  Bauçà et  al.,  2024; 
Iñiguez et al., 2020; Maberly & Gontero, 2017).
Although PEPCK is involved in the release of 
CO2 in plants that utilize the PEPCK-  type C 4 cycle 
(Figure  S1c,d), the PEPCK reaction is reversible 
(Figure  1), and thus in principle, PEPCK can also 
function as a carbon-  fixing enzyme. Carboxylation 
activity of PEPCK has been detected in the ex -
tracts of multiple species of brown algae (Akagawa 
et al.,  1972a; Busch & Schmid,  2001; Cabello-  Pasini 
et al.,  2000; Cabello-  Pasini & Alberte,  2001b; Gravot 
et al., 2010; Johnston & Raven,  1989; Kremer, 1981b; 
Kremer & Kuppers,  1977). In the 1960s–1980s, high 
carbon-  fixation activities by PEPCK under dark 
conditions were detected in macroalgae and con -
sidered to be involved in “light-  independent CO 2- 
fixation” or “dark fixation,” independent of RuBisCO 
and the CBB cycle (Akagawa et  al.,  1972a, 1972b; 
Akagawa, Nisizawa, & Ikawa,  1972; Cabello-  Pasini 
& Alberte,  1997; Craigie,  1963; Holbrook et al.,  1988; 
Johnston & Raven,  1989; Joshi et  al.,  1962;

BIOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF BROWN ALGAE PEPCKS
Kremer,  1981a, 1981b; Kremer & Kuppers,  1977; 
Willenbrink et  al.,  1975). PEPCK carboxylating ac -
tivities were at comparable levels in both light and 
dark conditions (Akagawa, Nisizawa, & Ikawa,  1972; 
Kremer,  1981a, 1981b; Kremer & Kuppers,  1977), 
which was distinct to the behavior of PEPC car -
boxylation and PEPCK decarboxylation in the C 4 
pathway. It has also been reported that the ratio of 
PEPCK carboxylase activity to RuBisCO activity var -
ied with the distance of the blades from the meristem 
(growing zone of the thallus), with PEPCK carboxyl -
ating activity being highest at the meristem (Cabello-  
Pasini & Alberte,  2001a, 2001b; Gómez et al.,  2007; 
Kremer, 1981b; Willenbrink et al.,  1975). PEPCK con -
tributed up to 10% of the total carboxylation capacity 
of brown algae but accounted for nearly half of the car-
boxylation capacity in the growing zone of the thallus 
(Gómez & Huovinen,  2012; Kremer,  1981b; Kremer & 
Kuppers,  1977). It was reported that the CO 2- fixation 
rate of PEPCK under dark conditions accounted for 
merely 50% of the carbon loss rate due to dark res -
piration (O 2 consumption), much lower than the case 
of PEPC in CAM plants (Gómez & Huovinen,  2012; 
Kremer,  1981b). Therefore, light-  independent CO 2- 
fixation by PEPCK in brown algae is not expected to 
have as high a flux as those observed in the PEPC-  
dependent C 4 and CAM pathways (Koch et al.,  2013; 
Raven & Giordano, 2017 ).
Concerning PEPC, a gene annotated as PEPC is 
present in the genome of Ectocarpus siliculosus (Cock 
et  al., 2010; Gravot et  al.,  2010), and quantitative re -
verse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT- 
PCR) analysis has confirmed the presence of PEPC 
transcripts in Saccharina japonica (Shao et al.,  2019), 
suggesting that these brown algae harbor PEPC. In the 
brown algae Eisenia bicyclis, Dictyota dichotoma, and 
Spatoglossum pacificum, fixed carbon is initially stored 
in the form of aspartate with no immediate generation 
of malate (Akagawa, Ikawa, & Nisizawa,  1972b), re -
sembling the metabolism of the NAD-  malic enzyme 
type (Figure S1b) and the PEPCK type (Figure S1c) C4- 
pathways. However, interestingly, in previous studies 
on biochemical CCMs in brown algae, PEPC activity, 
which is usually the enzyme responsible for carboxyl -
ation in the C 4 pathway (Figure S1), was not detected 
in the extracts, except in that of Dictyota guineensis 
(Holbrook et al., 1988). Furthermore, predictions of the 
subcellular localization of PEPC and PEPCK based on 
primary structure have contradicted the classical C 4 
and CAM pathways in plants (Chi et  al.,  2014; Shao 
et  al.,  2019). Although the observations described 
above raise the possibility that PEPCKs in brown algae 
play roles that differ from those proposed in classical 
C4- pathways, such as the carboxylation of PEP rather 
than the decarboxylation of OAA, the actual physiolog -
ical role of PEPCK and its contributions to CO2- fixation 
remain unclear.
Three types of PEPCK are known, and these 
types utilize ATP, GTP, or pyrophosphate (PPi) as 
the energy source. From a kinetic standpoint, ATP/
GTP- dependent PEPCKs prefer the decarboxylation 
reaction, while PPi- dependent PEPCK prefers the car -
boxylation reaction (McLeod & Holyoak, 2021; McLeod 
& Holyoak, 2023). PEPCK activity measurement in the 
ammonium sulfate precipitation fraction of extracts of 
the brown algae Ectocarpus siliculosus  showed 10- 
fold higher activity of ATP-  dependent carboxylation 
than that of decarboxylation (Busch & Schmid,  2001). 
Although these reports add support to the possibility 
that PEPCK in brown algae functions as a carbon- fixing 
enzyme, there are only examples of enzymatic analy -
sis of proteins partially purified from the brown algae 
Ascophyllum nodosum  and Ec. siliculosus (Busch & 
Schmid,  2001; Johnston & Raven,  1989). Recently, a 
PEPCK gene from Saccharina japonica was expressed 
in Escherichia coli but was obtained in the form of inclu-
sion bodies (Lin et al., 2025). Although PEPCK activity 
could be detected after a refolding process, the carbox-
ylation activity of the refolded protein was low compared 
to the activity of the partially purified enzyme from A. 
nodosum. To gain insight on the biochemical proper -
ties of PEPCK in brown algae, in this study, PEPCK 
genes from five brown algae, including Ec. siliculosus , 
Sargassum horneri, Saccharina japonica, Scytosiphon 
lomentaria, and Ishige okamurae , were successfully 
expressed in Escherichia coli . Recombinant proteins 
were obtained in soluble form and were purified with -
out denaturation. The biochemical properties of these 
enzymes were examined and compared with PEPCKs 
from other organisms. We further carried out anal -
ysis on PEPCK from I. okamurae ( Io- PEPCK), which 
exhibited the highest specific activity among the five 
brown algae PEPCKs. Combined with the examination 
of carbon- fixing activity in cell extracts of I. okamurae , 
a PEPCK- based C4 cycle- like pathway in brown algae 
has been proposed.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Chemicals, strains, algal material, 
media, and culture conditions
Unless mentioned otherwise, chemical reagents were 
purchased from Nacalai Tesque (Kyoto, Japan) or Fujifilm 
Wako Pure Chemicals (Osaka, Japan). Escherichia coli 
DH5α (Takara Bio, Kusatsu, Japan) was used for plas-
mid construction, and E. coli BL21-  CodonPlus(DE3)- 
RIL (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United 
States) was used for gene expression. These were 
cultivated in Luria-  Bertani medium (10 g · L−1 tryptone, 
5 g · L−1 yeast extract, and 5 g · L−1 NaCl) containing 
ampicillin (100  mg · L −1). Chloramphenicol (30 mg · 
L−1) was also added in the LB medium to cultivate the  
1324 |   
JIN et al.
E. coli BL21-  CodonPlus(DE3)- RIL cells. The brown 
alga Ishige okamurae was collected at a time between 
2:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. at low tide on July 21, 2024 (a 
spring tide day) along the coast (33°68´ N, 130°29 ′ E) 
of Shikanoshima Island in Fukuoka prefecture, Japan. 
The collected algal thallus was washed and then stored 
at −80°C until use.
Construction of gene expression plasmids
PEPCKs from five macroalgae Ectocarpus siliculosus , 
Sargassum horneri, Saccharina japonica, Scytosiphon 
lomentaria, and Ishige okamurae were selected to be 
analyzed in this study. The coding regions of these 
five PEPCK genes were commercially synthesized and 
provided in the cloning vector Twist (plasmids Twist- 
PEPCK(sp)- Es, - Sh, - Sj, - Sl, and - Io; Twist Bioscience, 
San Francisco, CA, United States). Codons were 
optimized for expression in Escherichia coli , and se -
quences that encode N- terminal 6× His- tags and NdeI- 
EcoRI restriction sites were included ( Figures S2 and 
S3a). Since several algal PEPCKs have been observed 
to be localized in the mitochondrion or chloroplast, as 
mentioned above, the potential targeting peptide se -
quences of these macroalgal PEPCKs were predicted 
by TargetP- 2.0 and DeepLoc 2.0. The expression plas-
mids were constructed as follows ( Figure  S3a). The 
predicted targeting peptide sequences were removed 
by inverse PCR using Twist- PEPCK(sp) plasmids as the 
templates and the primers listed in Table S1. After treat-
ment with DpnI to remove the templates, the amplified 
PCR products were phosphorylated and self-  ligated 
and then introduced into E. coli DH5a competent cells 
by heat shock treatment at 42°C for 45 s. After con -
firming the absence of unintended mutations by DNA 
sequencing analysis, the resulting plasmids (Twist-  
PEPCK) were digested with the restriction enzymes 
NdeI and EcoRI. The target PEPCK genes with regions 
encoding the His- tag and sticky ends were inserted into 
the expression vector pET21a(+) at the corresponding 
sites, resulting in the formation of the expression plas -
mids (pET21a- PEPCK). The T7 promoter and termina-
tor sequences were used as the primer set to select 
positive transformants and confirm the presence of 
PEPCK genes in the constructed expression plasmids 
(Figure S3b). DNA sequencing analysis was also car -
ried out to confirm the absence of unintended muta -
tions in the expression plasmids.
Gene expression and purification of 
PEPCK recombinant proteins
The expression plasmids were individually introduced 
into Escherichia coli BL21- CodonPlus(DE3)- RIL by heat 
shock treatment at 42°C for 45 s. Transformants were 
cultivated at 37°C until OD660 reached 0.4–0.6, and gene 
expression was induced by the addition of IPTG at a final 
concentration of 0.05 mM. Cells were further cultivated 
at 16°C for 20 h, and collected (4°C, 5500 × g, 15 min). 
Cells were resuspended in 20 mM sodium phosphate 
buffer (pH 7.4) containing 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imida-
zole, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) to 
prevent proteolysis. Mixtures were kept on ice, and cells 
were disrupted by sonication. After centrifugation (4°C, 
13,000 × g, 15 min), the supernatant was loaded onto a 
His GraviTrap column (Cytiva, Marlborough, MA, United 
States). Proteins were eluted with elution buffer contain-
ing 20 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 500 mM NaCl, 
and 500 mM imidazole. After exchanging the buffer of 
the relevant fractions to 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5) using 
Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter unit (MWCO 10 K; EMD 
Millipore, Billerica, MA, United States), samples were 
individually applied to an anion-  exchange column, 
Resource Q (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, United 
Kingdom). Proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 
NaCl (0–1.0 M) in 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5) at a flow rate 
of 2.0 mL · min−1. Fractions with PEPCK protein were col-
lected and concentrated using Amicon Ultra centrifugal 
filter unit (MWCO 10 K). Proteins were then applied to a 
gel filtration column, Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL 
(GE Healthcare), with a mobile phase of 50 mM Tris–HCl 
(pH 7.5) with 0.15 M NaCl and 10% glycerol (v/v) at a flow 
rate of 0.5 mL · min−1. Relevant fractions were concen-
trated using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter unit (MWCO 
10 K). Protein concentrations were determined with the 
Protein Assay System (Bio-  Rad, Hercules, CA, United 
States) using bovine serum albumin (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific, Waltham, MA, United States) as a standard. 
The homogeneity of PEPCK recombinant proteins was 
analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate- polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis (SDS- PAGE). Gels were stained with 
Coomassie Brilliant Blue.
Oligomerization analyses of the recombinant 
PEPCK proteins after purification were performed by 
gel filtration chromatography using the same column 
(Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 GL) and elution buf -
fer as described above. The absorbance derived from 
protein was monitored at 280 nm. Blue Dextran 2000 
was used to determine the void volume ( V0), while 
standard proteins (ribonuclease A: 13.7 kDa, carbonic 
anhydrase: 29  kDa, ovalbumin: 43  kDa, conalbumin: 
75 kDa, aldolase: 158 kDa, and ferritin: 440 kDa) of 
Gel Filtration Calibration Kits (GE Healthcare) were 
utilized to prepare a calibration curve ( Figure  S4a). 
The calibration curve of partition coefficient ( Kav) 
versus log molecular weight (Log Mr) was plotted 
(Figure  S4b). The K av values were calculated using 
Equation 1, where V0 is column void volume, Ve is pro-
tein elution volume, and V c is the geometric column 
volume (24 mL).

BIOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF BROWN ALGAE PEPCKS
Enzyme assays
Unless mentioned otherwise, PEPCK activities were as-
sayed by measuring the oxidation of NADH at 340 nm. 
In the direction of carboxylation, the generated OAA 
was quantified by coupling with malate dehydrogenase 
(MDH; Sigma, Darmstadt, Germany). The carboxyla -
tion mixture (250 μL) contained 50 mM MES (pH 5.5 for 
Es- PEPCK) or HEPES (pH 6.0 for Sl- PEPCK; pH 6.5 for 
Sj- , Sh- , and Io- PEPCK) buffer, 50 mM NaHCO3, 16 mM 
PEP, 2 mM ADP, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 1 mM dithi-
othreitol (DTT), 0.15 mM NADH, 10 U MDH, and PEPCK 
recombinant protein. In the direction of decarboxylation, 
PEP generation was quantified by coupling with pyru -
vate kinase (PK; Sigma) and lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH). The decarboxylation mixture (250 μL) contained 
50 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 4 mM OAA, 2 mM ATP, 
2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl 2, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM ADP, 
0.2 mM NADH, 5 U LDH, 4 U PK, and PEPCK recombi-
nant protein. An OAA solution was prepared just before 
use. Reaction mixtures without PEPCK protein were 
set as the controls. After a preincubation for 2 min, the 
reactions were started by adding ADP (for carboxyla -
tion) or OAA (for decarboxylation). The reactions were 
carried out at 25°C. Absorbance at 340 nm (0–3 min) 
was continuously monitored using a UV-  1600 spec -
trophotometer (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). The assays 
were performed in triplicate.
To examine the preference toward ADP and GDP, 
the reaction mixture (250 μL) contained 50 mM HEPES 
buffer (pH 6.5), 50 mM NaHCO3, 8 mM PEP, 2 mM ADP 
or GDP, 2 mM MgCl 2, 2 mM MnCl 2, 0.15 mM NADH, 
10 U MDH, and PEPCK recombinant protein.
To examine the preference toward different divalent 
cations, the reaction mixture (250 μL) contained 50 mM 
HEPES buffer (pH 6.5), 50 mM NaHCO 3, 8 mM PEP, 
2 mM ADP, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM divalent cation (MnCl 2, 
CoCl2, NiCl2, CaCl2, ZnSO4, CuCl2, and SrCl2) with or 
without 2 mM MgCl 2, 0.15 mM NADH, 10 U MDH, and 
PEPCK recombinant protein.
Determination of optimum pH for PEPCK 
recombinant proteins
The effects of pH on the decarboxylation and carboxy -
lation reactions were examined using various buff -
ers: sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.5–5.5), MES buffer 
(pH 5.5–6.5), HEPES buffer (pH 6.5–7.5), and Tris–HCl 
buffer (pH 7.5–9.0). We considered that the activities 
of MDH (for the carboxylation measurement), as well 
as LDH and PK (for the decarboxylation measure -
ment), could be affected by differences in pH, resulting 
in inaccuracies of the data obtained via the spectro -
photometric method. We thus directly quantified the 
production of ATP (carboxylation) and ADP (decarbox-
ylation) with high-  performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC; LC- 2050C 3D, Shimadzu) to measure PEPCK 
activities. The reaction mixture for carboxylation (50 μL) 
contained 50 mM buffer (pH 4.5–8.5), 50 mM NaHCO3, 
2 mM PEP, 1 mM ADP, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM MnCl2, 1 mM 
DTT, and 0.8 μg · mL−1 PEPCK protein. The reaction 
mixture for decarboxylation (50 μL) contained 50 mM 
buffer (pH 5.5–9.0), 2 mM OAA, 1 mM ATP, 2 mM 
MgCl2, 1 mM MnCl2, and 0.8 μg · mL−1 PEPCK protein. 
Mixtures without PEPCK protein were set as controls. 
After preincubation at 25°C for 2 min, reactions were 
started by adding OAA (decarboxylation) or PEP (car -
boxylation). After a 3-  min incubation, reactions were 
stopped by rapid cooling on ice and the addition of 1 M 
HCl or NaOH for 5 min. After neutralization, proteins 
in the reaction mixtures were removed by ultrafiltra -
tion using Amicon Ultra centrifugal filter units (MWCO 
3 K). Assays were performed in triplicate. The gener -
ated ADP (decarboxylation) or ATP (carboxylation) was 
quantified by HPLC.
The analysis of HPLC was carried out with a 
COSMOSIL 5C18- PAQ column (4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 μm 
particle size). The generated ADP (decarboxylation) or 
ATP (carboxylation) was quantified as follows. The mo-
bile phase consisted of solvent A (20 mM potassium 
phosphate buffer with 5 mM tetrabutylammonium hydro-
gen sulfate, pH 6.4) and solvent B (acetonitrile). A gradi-
ent of 0%–45% solvent B was applied from 0 to 15 min, 
followed by a 1- min maintenance period, then the propor-
tion was returned back to 0% solvent B, and the column 
was re- equilibrated for 4 min. A flow rate of 0.7 mL · min−1 
was maintained throughout the procedure. Absorbance 
at 259 nm was monitored by a UV detector.
Kinetic analysis
Kinetic analyses of the PEPCK reactions were car -
ried out as follows. For the carboxylation reaction, re -
action mixtures consisted of 50 mM MES (pH 5.5 for 
Es- PEPCK) or HEPES (pH 6.0 for Sl- PEPCK; pH 6.5 
for Sj- , Sh- , and Io- PEPCK) buffer, 50 mM NaHCO 3, 
16 mM PEP, 2 mM ADP, 2 mM MgCl 2, 2 mM MnCl 2, 
1 mM DTT, 0.15 mM NADH, 10 U MDH, and 0.4–0.8 μg 
· mL−1 PEPCK recombinant protein. When varying the 
concentration of a given substrate, the concentrations 
of other substrates were fixed at the concentrations 
given above. The concentration range of the evalu -
ated substrates was ADP (0.025 mM to 5 mM) and 
PEP (0.05 mM to 8 or 12 mM). For the kinetic analysis 
of PEPCK toward bicarbonate, Io - PEPCK protein was 
used. The reaction mixture was composed of 50 mM 
HEPES (pH 6.5) buffer, 16 mM PEP, 2 mM ADP, 2 mM 
MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl 2, 1 mM DTT, 0.15 mM NADH, 10 U 
MDH, 0.4 μg · mL−1 Io- PEPCK, and various concen -
trations of NaHCO 3 (0.5 mM to 50 mM) added from a 
stock solution (5, 50, or 500 mM) prepared immediately 
prior to the experiments. The presence of bicarbonate 
1326 |   
JIN et al.
from atmospheric carbon dioxide was negligible, with 
activity less than 0.1 μmol · min −1 · mg −1. The kinetic 
parameters of the decarboxylation reaction cata -
lyzed by Io - PEPCK toward OAA and ATP were meas -
ured. Activities with varying concentrations of OAA 
(0.025 mM to 5 mM) were measured by coupling with 
PK/LDH. Activities with varying concentrations of ATP 
(0.01 mM to 2 mM) were measured by determining the 
generated ADP via HPLC, as PK would regenerate 
ATP from ADP produced by PEPCK and thus affect 
the determination, particularly at low concentrations of 
ATP. The decarboxylation mixture (250 μL) for kinetic 
examination of OAA was composed of 50 mM Tris–HCl 
buffer (pH 7.5), 2 mM ATP, 2 mM MgCl 2, 2 mM MnCl 2, 
1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM ADP, 0.2 mM NADH, 5 U LDH, 4 
U PK, 0.4 μg · mL−1 Io- PEPCK recombinant protein, 
and various concentrations of OAA. The decarboxy -
lation mixture (50 μL) for kinetic examination of ATP 
was composed of 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 
4 mM OAA, 2 mM MgCl 2, 2 mM MnCl 2, 1 mM DTT, 
0.2 μg · mL−1 Io- PEPCK recombinant protein, and vari -
ous concentrations of ATP. All assays were performed 
in triplicate. The Michaelis–Menten equation was fit 
to the data using software Igor Pro, version 6.03AJ 
(WaveMetrics, Portland, OR, United States).
Effect of various metabolites on Io- PEPCK 
activity
To avoid any unexpected effects of the examined metab-
olites, such as pyruvate or malate, on LDH/PK or MDH, 
the effects of various metabolites on Io - PEPCK were 
analyzed by measuring the generation of ATP (carboxy-
lation) or ADP (decarboxylation) via HPLC. The following 
metabolites were examined: amino acids alanine, argi -
nine, aspartate, glutamate, glycine, and phenylalanine; 
TCA cycle intermediates citrate, succinate, and malate; 
glycolysis intermediates pyruvate, glucose 6- phosphate, 
fructose 1,6-  bisphosphate, and 3-  phosphoglycerate; 
and acetate. The carboxylation mixture (50 μL) con -
tained 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 6.5), 50 mM NaHCO3, 
16 mM PEP, 2 mM ADP, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 1 mM 
DTT, 0.2 μg · mL−1 Io- PEPCK recombinant protein, and 
5 mM metabolite. The decarboxylation mixture (50 μL) 
contained 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 4 mM OAA, 
2 mM ATP, 2 mM MgCl2, 2 mM MnCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 μg · 
mL−1 Io- PEPCK recombinant protein, and 5 mM metabo-
lite. All assays were performed in triplicate.
To study the effects of ATP on the carboxylation ac-
tivity of Io- PEPCK, the concentration of ADP was fixed 
at 2 mM, while the concentrations of ATP ranged from 
0 to 4 mM. To analyze inhibition by ATP, carboxylation 
activities of Io - PEPCK toward various ADP concentra -
tions (0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, and 4 mM) with 1, 2, 
3, or 4 mM ATP were examined by coupling with MDH. 
The carboxylation activity with ADP but without ATP 
was set as the control. The carboxylation activity was 
measured by measuring the oxidation of NADH. All as-
says were performed in triplicate.
Preparation of cell- free extract and activity 
measurement
Extraction of total soluble proteins from the plants of 
brown alga Ishige okamurae was carried out based on the 
method previously reported (Capó- Bauçà et  al., 2023). 
Pieces of I. okamurae (~4 g fresh weight) were frozen and 
ground to a fine powder with liquid nitrogen and alpha-  
alumina powder in a prechilled mortar. The powder was 
homogenized with 12 mL of ice- cold extraction buffer con-
sisting of 100 mM Bicine (pH 8.0), 1 mM ethylenediamine-
tetraacetic acid, 10 mM DTT, 100 mM β- mercaptoethanol, 
2% plant protease inhibitor cocktail (Merck, Burlington, 
MA, United States), 4 mM PMSF, and 0.5% Triton X- 100. 
Polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (0.6 g) was added to the mixture 
to reduce viscosity, followed by stirring with an ice- cold 
spatula. After centrifugation (4°C, 15000 x g, 2 min), the 
supernatant was concentrated using an Amicon Ultra 
centrifugal filter unit (MWCO 10 K) and then loaded onto 
a PD- 10 column (GE Healthcare) to remove the metab-
olites from the cell extract using a buffer consisting of 
50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 0.15 M NaCl, 1% plant protease 
inhibitor cocktail, 4 mM PMSF, and 10% glycerol (v/v). 
The total soluble protein content was determined using 
the method described above.
The specific PEPCK (carboxylation and decarboxyl -
ation) and PEPC activities of total soluble proteins were 
examined by measuring the oxidation of NADH. The 
mixture (250 μL) to measure PEPCK carboxylation ac -
tivity contained 50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 6.5), 50 mM 
NaHCO3, 16 mM PEP, 2 mM ADP, 2 mM MgCl 2, 2 mM 
MnCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.15 mM NADH, 10 U MDH, and  
4 μg · mL−1 total protein. The mixture (250 μL) to mea -
sure decarboxylation activity contained 50 mM Tris–
HCl buffer (pH 7.5), 1 mM OAA, 2 mM ATP, 2 mM MgCl2, 
2 mM MnCl2, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM ADP, 0.2 mM NADH, 
5 U LDH, 4 U PK, and 4 μg · mL−1 total protein. The 
concentration of OAA for the decarboxylation mea -
surement was lowered to 1 mM to limit the effects of 
nonenzymatic degradation of OAA. The PEPC activity 
of total soluble proteins was measured using a reac -
tion mixture containing 50 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.0), 
50 mM NaHCO3, 16 mM PEP, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 mM DTT, 
0.15 mM NADH, 10 U MDH, and 8 μg · mL −1 total pro -
tein. All assays were performed in triplicate.

RESULTS
Primary structure analysis of five PEPCKs 
from brown macroalgae
We used the PEPCK ( Sj- PEPCK) sequence from 
Saccharina japonica as the query to perform a Blast 
search with the NCBI database. At the time of this study, 
the number of available genome sequences or tran -
scriptome data of brown algae was still limited (<20). An 
alignment of the sequences retrieved from the search 
is shown in Figure   S5a. The result of a phylogenetic 
analysis showed that the PEPCKs from brown algae 
were separated into several subgroups (Figure S5b). As 
we wanted to obtain a broad picture of the properties 
of PEPCK from brown algae, we selected multiple pro -
teins for analyses. We selected the putative PEPCKs 
from Ectocarpus siliculosus  ( Es- PEPCK), Ishige oka -
murae ( Io- PEPCK), Sargassum horneri ( Sh- PEPCK), 
and Scytosiphon lomentaria (Sl- PEPCK) in addition to 
Sj- PEPCK. Although the five putative PEPCKs were 
77%–87% identical to one another, the proteins repre -
sented different subgroups of the PEPCKs in the phy -
logenetic tree ( Figure  S5b). The proteins from brown 
algae shared 46%–49% identities with their counterpart 
from Escherichia coli (Eco- PEPCK). Each species har-
bored only a single sequence with homology to previ -
ously reported PEPCKs.
The ATP and GTP-  dependent PEPCKs harbored 
several essential motifs, including the PEPCK-  
specific domain, kinase-  1a (P-  loop) and kinase-  2 
domains, and an adenine or a guanine binding site, 
which are responsible for the association with PEP/
OAA, phosphate-  binding, Mg 2+ binding, and adenine 
or guanine binding, respectively (Dunten et al.,  2002; 
Matte et al., 1996 ; Matte et al.,  1997; Tari et al., 1996; 
Tari et  al.,  1997). We aligned the sequences of the 
five algal PEPCKs with other experimentally exam -
ined ATP-  dependent PEPCKs from various organ -
isms, including bacteria, yeast, plants, and green 
alga (Figure S6). All five putative brown algal PEPCKs 
possessed the conserved binding motifs. In addition, 
the five proteins harbored the motifs for ribose and 
adenine binding, suggesting that they were ATP-  
dependent PEPCKs. All five algal proteins harbored 
the key residues that constitute the active site in Eco - 
PEPCK (Delbaere et  al.,  2004; Sudom et  al.,  2001; 
Sudom et al., 2003 ).
Predictions using TargetP and DeepLoc (Almagro 
et al., 2019; Thumuluri et al., 2022) on the five PEPCKs 
suggested that they localized in the mitochondrion or 
chloroplast (Table S2). Their signal peptides (30–47 aa 
length, from the initial Met) and the predicted cleavage 
sites are shown in Table S2.
Expression and purification of the 
recombinant PEPCK proteins
The five putative PEPCK genes were synthesized and 
individually modified to introduce a 6 x His tag se -
quence at their N-  termini. Sequences corresponding 
to their predicted signal peptides (about 90–141 bps) 
were removed, and the resulting truncated genes were 
expressed in Escherichia coli BL21-  CodonPlus(DE3)- 
RIL ( Figure  S3). After adding isopropyl β - d- 1- 
thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), cells were cultivated at 
16°C to reduce the formation of inclusion bodies. The 
His- tagged recombinant proteins were purified using 
a nickel chelate affinity column, followed by anion- 
exchange and gel-  filtration chromatography. The ap -
parent homogeneities of the recombinant proteins 
were examined by SDS-  PAGE. The obtained bands 
displayed molecular masses that corresponded well to 
their theoretical molecular masses ( Es- : 59.2 kDa, Io- : 
59.7 kDa, Sh- : 63.3 kDa, Sj- : 59.3 kDa, and Sl - PEPCK: 
59.3 kDa; Figure S7).
Oligomerization analysis of the putative PEPCK 
recombinant proteins was performed by gel-  filtration 
chromatography (Figure S4c). Es- , Io- , Sh- , Sj- , and Sl- 
PEPCK were individually eluted at 14.21, 14.26, 13.77, 
14.24, and 14.11 mL, corresponding to calculated mo -
lecular masses of 59.2, 57.9, 72.0, 58.4, and 61.9 kDa, 
respectively. These values were comparable to the the-
oretical molecular masses of the monomers, suggest -
ing that the putative PEPCKs are monomeric proteins.
Substrates recognized by the PEPCKs 
from brown algae
The PEPCKs from brown algae were predicted to 
be ATP-  dependent based on their amino acid se -
quences. To confirm this, the carboxylation activity of 
the five PEPCKs was examined using ADP or GDP 
(Figure  S8). The activity levels of Es - , Io- , Sh- , Sj- , 
and Sl- PEPCK with ADP were significantly higher 
(23- , 40-  , 47-  , 30-  , and 42-  fold, respectively) than 
those with GDP, confirming that these proteins are 
ATP- dependent PEPCKs.
1328 |   
JIN et al.
Previously known PEPCKs are metal-  dependent 
enzymes, which often utilize Mg 2+ and a second metal 
ion such as Mn2+. We first examined the effect of add -
ing various divalent metal cations on the five PEPCKs 
in the presence of 2 mM Mg2+ (Figure S9). In the pres-
ence of Mg 2+, the addition of Mn 2+ resulted in the 
highest carboxylation activity of the PEPCK proteins, 
with activities reaching more than 48-  fold over that ob-
served in the presence of Mg 2+ alone ( Io- PEPCK). A 
dramatic increase in activity was also observed with 
Co2+ in the presence of Mg2+. The addition of Ni2+ had 
little effect on activity, while Ca 2+, Zn2+, Cu2+, and Sr2+ 
resulted in a decrease in activity. When only a single 
divalent cation was available, in all five PEPCKs, Mn 2+ 
alone supported carboxylation activities as high as or 
even higher than those observed with Mg 2+ and Mn2+. 
Co2+ alone also supported high activity, although lev -
els were lower than those observed with Mn 2+ alone. 
It has been reported that the concentration of Mn 2+ 
in algae cells is low, much lower than that of Mg 2+. 
Concentrations of Mg 2+ have been reported to be 
280-  to 1900-  fold higher than those of Mn 2+ (Wahbeh 
et al., 1985). Therefore, the possibilities of the PEPCK 
enzymes in algal cells using Mn 2+ alone were consid -
ered extremely low, and further enzyme analyses were 
carried out in the presence of both Mg 2+ and Mn2+.
Specific activity measurement and kinetic 
analysis of PEPCK recombinant proteins
The effect of pH on PEPCK activity was examined in 
both the carboxylation (pH 4.5–8.5) and decarboxylation 
(5 to 9) directions. Es -  and Sl- PEPCK displayed their 
highest carboxylation activity at pH 5.5 and 6.0, respec-
tively, while Io - , Sh- , and Sj- PEPCK preferred pH 6.5 
(Figure S10a). All five enzymes showed maximum de -
carboxylation activity at pH 7.5 (Figure S10b).
The specific carboxylation and decarboxylation ac -
tivities of the five PEPCKs were measured under op -
timal reaction conditions. Although the five PEPCKs 
shared high identities, they displayed differences in 
activity (Figure 2). Io- PEPCK displayed the highest ac-
tivities in both the carboxylation and decarboxylation 
directions, with specific activities of 48.4 ± 1.6 and 
63.3 ± 3.2 μmol · min−1 · mg−1, respectively. In contrast, 
Es- PEPCK showed the lowest activities (16.4 ± 1.1 and 
12.2 ± 0.4 μmol · min−1 · mg−1 in carboxylation and de -
carboxylation, respectively).
We next carried out a kinetic examination of the five 
proteins in the direction of carboxylation. Io - PEPCK 
displayed the highest kcat/Km values for PEP and ADP, 
and there was an approximate threefold difference in 
corresponding kcat/Km values among the five enzymes 
(Table 1, Figures 3 and S11), mainly due to differences in 
kcat values. For further analysis, we selected Io- PEPCK, 
which displayed the highest kcat/Km values for PEP and 
ADP among the five enzymes. When activity was mea-
sured with varying concentrations of bicarbonate, the 
activity followed Michaelis–Menten kinetics, and a Vmax 
value comparable with those observed with varying 
concentrations of ADP and PEP was obtained. We also 
carried out a kinetic examination in the direction of de -
carboxylation using Io- PEPCK. The kcat/Km values were 
slightly higher for the decarboxylation reaction compared 
to the carboxylation reaction ( Table 1), consistent with 
previous studies on ATP- dependent PEPCKs.
Effect of metabolites on Io- PEPCK activity
To explore the potential modulation of PEPCK in brown 
algae, we examined the response of Io- PEPCK to vari-
ous metabolites, including those related to C3/C4 conver-
sion (pyruvate, malate, succinate, alanine, aspartate) and 
those that have been examined on PEPCK activity in other 
organisms (acetate, arginine, glycine, phenylalanine, 
glucose 6- phosphate [G6P], fructose 1,6- bisphosphate 
[FBP], 3- phosphoglycerate [3- PGA], citrate, glutamate; 
Figure 4). We did not observe dramatic effects of these 
compounds in either the carboxylation or decarboxyla -
tion activities. We did observe a slight tendency suggest-
ing that the presence of citrate and malate might induce 
decarboxylation, as they enhanced the decarboxylation 
activity (citrate by 25%, malate by 16%) while inhibiting 
the carboxylation activity by 20% (Figure 4).

BIOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF BROWN ALGAE PEPCKS
We also examined the inhibition of the carboxyl -
ation activity of Io - PEPCK by ATP, which has been 
reported in the PEPCKs from several organisms. In 
the presence of 2 mM ADP, 16 mM PEP, and 50 mM 
NaHCO3, 0.2–4 mM of ATP were added to the car -
boxylation reaction mixture ( Figure  5a). A decrease 
in activity was observed at ATP concentrations above 
1 mM. When ATP was present at 4 mM, the decrease 
in carboxylation activity was nearly 90%. We thus 
carried out carboxylating activity measurements 
with various ADP concentrations (0.1–4 mM) in the 
presence of 1, 2, 3, or 4 mM ATP (as an inhibitor; 
Figure  5b). We considered that contributions of the 
reverse reaction to our results were limited, as accu -
mulation of the product OAA was prevented by the 
coupling enzyme malate dehydrogenase, which was 
present in excess. We observed that the data fit well 
to a mixed-  type inhibition model ( Figure S12) whose 
equation is indicated in Equation  2.
Concentrations of the substrate ADP and the in -
hibitor ATP are designated [S] and [P], respectively. 
Ks and K p are the dissociation constants for the sub -
strate ADP and the product inhibitor ATP, respec -
tively. The change of dissociation constant between 
enzyme-  ADP complex and ATP compared to that be -
tween enzyme and ATP was designated as a factor 
of α. We assigned V max and K s values of 51.9 μmol · 
min−1 · mg −1 and 0.11 mM, respectively, which were 
calculated from the analysis of the reaction in the 
absence of ATP. Equation  2 fit well to our data with 
various concentrations of ATP, and the constants 
Kp and α  were calculated as 0.095 ± 0.021 mM and 
28.0 ± 7.7, respectively. As α was greater than 1, the 
binding of ATP occurred more toward the vacant en -
zyme than toward the enzyme-  ADP complex. Our 
result suggests that allosteric binding of ATP to Io - 
PEPCK causes a mixed-  type inhibition against the 
carboxylation reaction.
Measurement of PEPCK and PEPC 
activities from cell extract of Ishige 
okamurae
In order to explore the function(s) of PEPCK in brown 
algae, we extracted the total soluble proteins from 
the brown alga Ishige okamurae , and measured 
PEPCK and PEPC activities. The PEPCK specific 
activity of total soluble proteins was 1.04 ± 0.10 μmol 
· min −1 · mg −1 in the direction of carboxylation and 
1.11 ± 0.07 μmol · min −1 · mg −1 in that of decarboxy -
lation. The level of PEPCK carboxylation activity 
was 3.5-  fold higher than that observed in cell ex -
tracts of Ascophyllum nodosum  (0.3  μmol · min −1 · 
mg−1), a species of brown algae also considered to 
utilize PEPCK instead of PEPC in C 4- like metabo -
lism (Johnston & Raven,  1989). In terms of PEPC 
activity, the activity in cell extracts of I. okamurae  
was 0.09 ± 0.00 μmol · min−1 · mg−1, corresponding to 
only 9% of PEPCK carboxylating activity ( Figure  6). 
This result suggests that PEPCK rather than PEPC 
dominates the carboxylation in I. okamurae , which 
is consistent with previous studies on other brown 
algae.

DISCUSSION
Brown algae are presumed to employ a C 4- like path-
way to concentrate CO2 for carbon fixation by RuBisCO 
(Shao et al., 2019). However, the enzymes, metabolites, 
and pathways involved in CCMs in brown algae are still 
poorly understood. The biochemical properties of the 
enzymes involved and their subcellular localization 
must be elucidated to better understand the CO2- fixing 
mechanism in brown algae. This study presented the 
enzymatic properties of purified PEPCKs from multiple 
brown macroalgae. The results provided enzymatic 
properties that can be presumed to be widely shared 
among PEPCKs from brown algae.
Although the identities among the five enzymes 
were higher than 77%, we observed differences in 
their carboxylation activities, most prominently in 
turnover numbers ( kcat). There was an approximate 
threefold difference between the highest ( Io- PEPCK) 
and the lowest ( Es- PEPCK) activities. Intriguingly, 
Io- , Sh- , and Sj- PEPCKs displayed higher decarbox -
ylation activity than carboxylation activity, whereas 
Es-  and Sl- PEPCKs displayed higher carboxylation 
activities (Figure 2). The mechanistic reason for this is

on the decarboxylation activity were examined. When varying the concentration of a given substrate, the other substrates were fixed at the 
following concentrations: 2 mM ADP, 16 mM PEP, and 50 mM NaHCO3 in carboxylation; 2 mM ATP and 4 mM OAA in decarboxylation.

unknown, but Es -  and Sl- PEPCKs are structurally re -
lated to one another ( Figure S5). In addition, this may 
be related to the optimal pH and the reaction condi -
tions applied for the enzymes. In the decarboxylation 
reaction, all five enzymes displayed an optimal pH of 
7.5, and activities were measured at this pH. In the 
carboxylation direction, Io- , Sh- , and Sj- PEPCKs dis-
played an optimal pH of 6.5, while those for Es -  and 
Sl- PEPCKs were 5.5 and 6.0, respectively. Whereas 
PEPC utilized bicarbonate as a substrate, it has been 
shown that the true substrate of PEPCK in the carbox -
ylation direction is CO 2 (Cooper et al.,  1968; Miller & 
Lane,  1968). The concentration of CO 2, compared to 
that of bicarbonate, displayed dramatic increases when 
the pH decreased from 6.5 ([CO 2]/[HCO3
−] = ~0.71) to 
5.5 ([CO 2]/[HCO3
−] = ~7.1), and this may have had an 
effect on the measured specific activity, favoring car -
boxylation. Overall, the activity levels of PEPCKs from 
brown algae were comparable to or higher than those 
of their counterparts from terrestrial plants and micro -
organisms. These included enzymes from the C4 grass

Megathyrsus maximus, the C3 plants Cucumis sativus 
and Arabidopsis thaliana, the CAM plant Ananas co -
mosus, and the bacteria Anaerobiospirillum succinicip-
roducens and Escherichia coli (Table S3). The number 
of enzymes for which Vmax ∕Km /bracketleft.s1HCO −
3
/bracketright.s1 values have 
been determined is still limited, but that of Io - PEPCK 
was higher than those of previously studied enzymes, 
including that from the CAM plant Ananas comosus 
(pineapple; Aco- PEPCK) (Table 2).
In previously characterized ATP- dependent PEPCKs, 
activity in the presence of both Mg 2+ and Mn 2+ was 
higher than that in the presence of Mn 2+ alone. It has 
been reported that the presence of Mg2+ enhances the 
affinity of the enzyme for Mn 2+ (Fukuda et  al.,  2004; 
Lee et  al.,  1981; Tari et  al.,  1997). The crystal struc -
ture of the ATP-  dependent PEPCK from Escherichia 
coli revealed the binding sites for Mg 2+ and Mn2+ (Tari 
et al., 1997). Possibly correlating to the fact that Mg 2+ 
is a hard Lewis acid, Mg 2+ seems to be coordinated 
into an all- oxygen ligand environment, and its position 
is consistent with its role as a cosubstrate with ATP. In 
contrast, the slightly larger and softer Lewis acid Mn 2+ 
is bound to a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen ligands 
and acts to reduce the electrostatic repulsions between 
the enolate of pyruvate and the γ - phosphate of ATP in 
the crystals (Tari et al., 1997). Intriguingly, we observed 
that the carboxylase activities of the PEPCKs from the 
five brown algae in the presence of Mn 2+ alone were 
higher (13%–25%) than those with both Mg2+ and Mn2+. 
As the Mg 2+-  and Mn 2+- binding residues in PEPCK 
from E. coli were completely conserved in the PEPCKs 
from brown algae (Figure S6), the position and roles of 
the Mn2+ that replaced the Mg 2+ in the E. coli enzyme 
are of interest.
We observed that the five PEPCKs from brown algae 
existed as monomers, as is the case for enzymes in 
Escherichia coli ( Eco- PEPCK; Sudom et  al.,  2003) 
and Anaerobiospirillum succiniciproducens

BIOCHEMICAL PROPERTIES OF BROWN ALGAE PEPCKS
(Asu- PEPCK; Podkovyrov & Zeikus,  1993). PEPCKs 
with other quaternary structures are known, including 
enzymes from the plants Megathyrsus maximus  (hex-
amer; Burnell,  1986), Arabidopsis thaliana (hexamer; 
Rojas et  al.,  2019), and Cucumis sativus (tetramer; 
Walker et  al.,  1995); from Saccharomyces cerevi -
siae (tetramer; Andrade et al.,  2010); from the para -
site Trypanosoma cruzi  (dimer; Trapani et al.,  2001); 
and from the diatom Skeletonema costatum (dimer; 
Cabello-  Pasini et al.,  2000). Structural analysis of T. 
cruzi PEPCK ( Tcr- PEPCK) suggested that residues 
in the N-  terminal region (in the domain of Leu10-  
Gly31) played roles in the oligomerization of the pro -
tein ( Figure  S6; Trapani et  al.,  2001). However, this 
alone may not explain the tendency for subunit as -
sembly, as the five PEPCKs from brown algae, as well 
as Eco- PEPCK and Asu- PEPCK, possessed several 
of the conserved residues in the corresponding re -
gions while existing as monomers. We do note that 
the recombinant PEPCKs examined here were pro -
teins truncated at their N-  termini to remove the pre -
dicted transport peptides (30–47 aa length), which 
were close to regions corresponding to the oligo -
merization domain in Tcr - PEPCK. We thus cannot 
rule out the possibility that the truncations affected 
the quaternary structure of the proteins. Indeed, the 
green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii  only harbors a 
single gene encoding PEPCK, but produces two iso -
forms, a hexameric Cre - PEPCK1 and a monomeric 
Cre- PEPCK2; it has been postulated that these two 
isoforms are generated through alternative splicing 
of the gene transcript or regulated proteolysis of the 
enzyme (Torresi et al.,  2023). Alternative splicing of 
gene transcripts has also been observed in brown 
algae (Cormier et al.,  2017; Franco et al.,  2008; Teng 
et al., 2024; Wu et al., 2013). Therefore, there is a pos-
sibility that the PEPCKs from brown algae also form 
isoforms in vivo through alternative splicing.
PEPCK is present in all three domains of life and 
plays important roles in metabolism beyond in the C 4 
cycle in C4 and CAM plants (Leegood & Walker,  2003; 
Walker et  al.,  1997; Walker et  al.,  2021; Yang 
et al.,  2009), including in gluconeogenesis. PEPCK is 
thus regulated by a variety of metabolites (Leegood 
& Walker,  2003). The carboxylation activity of Io - 
PEPCK was moderately inhibited by intermediates of 
the TCA cycle (citrate, succinate, and malate), whereas 
the same intermediates slightly enhanced the decar -
boxylation activity ( Figure 4). Similar responses were 
also observed in the PEPCKs from pineapple (Martin 
et al.,  2011), Arabidopsis thaliana (Rojas et al.,  2019), 
and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Torresi et al.,  2023), 
suggesting that accumulation of TCA-  cycle interme -
diates promotes decarboxylation and gluconeogene -
sis. This regulation may be particularly relevant if the 
PEPCK proteins from brown algae are localized in 
the mitochondrion, as suggested by their N-  terminal 
sequences ( Table  S2). In contrast, the responses 
of PEPCKs from various organisms to amino acids 
and intermediates of glycolysis (G6P, FBP, 3-  PGA, 
FIGURE 7 Proposed model of C 4 cycle in brown alga Ishige okamurae . The proposed C 4 pathway in brown algae based on this

and pyruvate) vary. For instance, glutamate inhibited 
Arabidopsis thaliana PEPCK (Rojas et  al.,  2019) but 
had little effect on Io- PEPCK and PEPCKs from pine -
apple (Martin et  al.,  2011) and the C 4 plant Urochloa 
panicoides (Burnell,  1986). Phenylalanine enhanced 
the decarboxylation activity of C. reinhardtii  PEPCK 
(Torresi et al., 2023) but not Io- PEPCK. The glycolysis- 
intermediates FBP and 3- PGA both inhibited the decar-
boxylation activity of PEPCKs from Ar. thaliana  (Rojas 
et al., 2019), pineapple (Martin et al., 2011), and U. pan-
icoides (Burnell, 1986), but did not affect C. reinhardtii  
PEPCK (Cre- PEPCK1 and 2; Torresi et al.,  2023). By 
contrast, Io- PEPCK decarboxylation was promoted by 
3- PGA, whereas FBP had little effect.
In many plants, including C 3, C4, and CAM plants, 
PEPCK activity is also regulated by phosphorylation: 
PEPCK is phosphorylated in the dark and reversed 
by light (Leegood & Walker,  2003; Walker et al.,  1997; 
Walker et  al.,  2021). PEPCKs that are subject to 
phosphorylation, such as the PEPCKs from Ananas 
comosus (Aco- PEPCK), Megathyrsus maximus (Mma- 
PEPCK), Zea mays (Zma- PEPCK), Arabidopsis thali -
ana (Ath- PEPCK), and Cucumis sativus (Csa- PEPCK; 
Chao et  al.,  2014; Leegood & Walker,  2003; Rojas 
et  al.,  2019; Shen et  al.,  2017; Walker et  al.,  1997; 
Walker et  al., 2002; Walker & Leegood,  1995, 1996), 
possess an N-  terminal extension containing a con -
served phosphorylation site ( Figure S6). However, the 
PEPCKs from brown algae did not possess N-  terminal 
extensions and lacked the conserved phosphorylation 
site motif (Figure S6). Our knowledge at present does 
not suggest a phosphorylation-  mediated regulation of 
PEPCKs in brown algae.
The concentration of ATP seems to be another factor 
for the regulation of PEPCK. Our analyses showed that 
the carboxylation activity of Io- PEPCK was subject to a 
mixed- type inhibition by ATP . Inhibition of PEPCK car-
boxylation activity with increases in ATP concentration 
has also been reported in enzymes from other organ -
isms, such as the brown alga Laminaria hyperborea 
(Weidner & Kuppers,  1982), the C4 plant Megathyrsus 
maximus (Walker et al., 1997; Walker et al., 2002), and 
the parasite Trypanosoma cruzi  (Urbina,  1987). The 
ATP/ADP ratio has also been observed to modulate the 
affinity of PEPCK for the substrates: Higher ATP/ADP 
ratios increased the affinity for OAA while decreasing 
the affinity for PEP (Leegood & Walker,  2003; Walker 
et al., 2002; Walker & Chen, 2002). These findings sug-
gest that the ATP concentration and/or ATP/ADP ratio 
may act as signals to regulate PEPCK in vivo and may 
be important in organisms, including brown algae, that 
do not utilize phosphorylation as a means to regulate 
PEPCK activity.
PEPC is responsible for the CO 2 fixation and pro -
duction of OAA from PEP in the C 4 cycle in C 4 plants 
(Figure S1). However, many studies have shown that 
PEPC activity could not be detected in the cell extracts 
of brown algae, while relatively high levels of PEPCK 
carboxylation activity were observed (Akagawa, 
Ikawa, & Nisizawa,  1972a; Busch & Schmid,  2001; 
Cabello- Pasini et al., 2000; Kremer & Kuppers,  1977). 
Our analysis of the cell extracts from Ishige okamu -
rae also indicated that PEPC activity was very low, 
only 9% of the observed PEPCK carboxylation activ -
ity ( Figure 6). The carboxylation activities of purified 
PEPCKs from brown algae were similar to those of 
purified PEPCs from C 4 plants, such as maize. The 
carboxylation activity deriving from PEPCK observed 
in cell extracts of I. okamurae was also comparable 
to the activity deriving from PEPC in maize extracts 
(Uedan & Sugiyama, 1976; Willeford et al., 1990). This 
raises the possibility that PEPCK could play a role in 
fixing CO2, similar to the role of PEPC in the C 4 path-
way, which has been proposed in the past (Akagawa, 
Ikawa, & Nisizawa,  1972a). In this case, the simplest 
scenario would be that PEPCK functions as a carbox -
ylase in the cytosol of I. okamurae and possibly other 
species, replacing the cytosolic PEPC ( Figure 7). The 
generated OAA could be converted to either malate 
by malate dehydrogenase or to aspartate by amino -
transferase in the cytosol, followed by transport to the 
cells where the CBB cycle and RuBisCO are active. 
Release of CO 2 can be carried out by either PEPCK 
or malic enzyme, both capable of mitochondrial local -
ization based on their primary structures with putative 
signal sequences (Figure 7). In this scenario, however, 
it would be necessary that PEPCK be present in the 
cytosol in addition to the mitochondrion. As only a sin -
gle PEPCK gene has been observed in brown algae 
(Chi et  al.,  2014), alternative splicing of the PEPCK 
gene may occur in I. okamurae , resulting in the pro -
duction of two isoforms of PEPCK (cytosolic and mi -
tochondrial) responsible for the fixation and release of 
CO2 in the C4 cycle- like pathway. Further experimental 
evidence on alternative splicing and subcellular local -
ization(s) of PEPCKs, along with the activities, and in 
particular, the localization of other potentially import -
ant enzymes such as PEPC and malic enzyme, will 
be necessary to better understand the mechanisms of 
CCMs in brown algae.
