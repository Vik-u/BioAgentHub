Introduction of a C 4 photosynthetic pathway into C 3 rice ( Oryza sativa ) requires
installation of a biochemical pump that concentrates CO 2 at the site of carboxylation
in modiﬁed bundle sheath cells. To investigate the feasibility of this, we generated a
quadruple line that simultaneously accumulates four of the core C 4 photosynthetic
enzymes from the NADP-malic enzyme subtype, phospho enolpyruvate carboxylase
(ZmPEPC), NADP-malate dehydrogenase ( ZmNADP-MDH), NADP-malic enzyme
(ZmNADP-ME), and pyruvate phosphate dikinase ( ZmPPDK). This led to enhanced
enzyme activity and mild phenotypic perturbations but was largely neutral in its effects
on photosynthetic rate. Measurements of the ﬂux of 13CO2 through photosynthetic
metabolism revealed a signiﬁcant increase in the incorporation of 13C into malate,
consistent with increased ﬁxation of 13CO2 via PEP carboxylase in lines expressing
the maize PEPC enzyme. However, there was no signiﬁcant differences in labeling of
3-phosphoglycerate (3PGA) indicating that there was no carbon ﬂux through NADP-
ME into the Calvin-Benson cycle. There was also no signiﬁcant difference in labeling
of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) indicating that there was no carbon ﬂux through PPDK.
Crossing the quadruple line with a line with reduced glycine decarboxylase H-protein
(OsGDCH) abundance led to a photosynthetic phenotype characteristic of the reduced
OsGDCH line and higher labeling of malate, aspartate and citrate than in the quintuple
line. There was evidence of 13C labeling of aspartate indicating 13CO2 ﬁxation into
oxaloacetate by PEPC and conversion to aspartate by the endogenous aspartate
aminotransferase activity. While Kranz anatomy or other anatomical modiﬁcations have
not yet been installed in these plants to enable a fully functional C 4 cycle, these results
demonstrate for the ﬁrst-time a partial ﬂux through the carboxylation phase of NADP-
ME C4 metabolism in transgenic rice containing two of the key metabolic steps in the
C4 pathway.

Lin et al. C4 Biochemical Pathway in Rice
INTRODUCTION
A major recent research objective has been the engineering of
a C 4 photosynthetic pathway into rice 1(Kajala et al., 2011;
von Caemmerer et al., 2012; Ermakova et al., 2019), potentially
leading to an increase in radiation use eﬃciency and yield of up to
50% (Hibberd et al., 2008). The C4 pathway represents a complex
combination of both biochemical and anatomical adaptations
that suppresses photorespiration by eﬀectively saturating ribulose
bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) with CO 2. In the
majority of C 4 plants, this is achieved by compartmentalization
of photosynthetic reactions between two morphologically distinct
cell types: the mesophyll cells (MCs) and the bundle sheath cells
(BSCs). Operating across these cells is a biochemical CO 2 pump
elevating the CO 2 concentration in the BSCs where Rubisco is
located (Hatch, 1987).
There are three primary variants of this pump characterized by
the main decarboxylase reaction (Hatch et al., 1975). The NADP-
ME subtype was chosen for engineering C 4 photosynthesis into
rice as it is well-characterized in the C 4 model crop species
maize (Zea mays) and potentially requires the fewest biochemical
enzymes among all C 4 subtypes (Weber and von Caemmerer,
2010; Kajala et al., 2011; Ermakova et al., 2019). Each molecule
of CO 2 entering the cytosol of the MCs is ﬁrst converted to
bicarbonate (HCO 3−) by the activity of carbonic anhydrase
(CA) and then incorporated into phospho enolpyruvate (PEP)
by PEP carboxylase (PEPC), yielding the C 4 acid oxaloacetate
(OAA). OAA is taken up into the chloroplast of the MCs
where it is reduced to malate by the NADP-dependent malate
dehydrogenase (NADP-MDH). Malate is exported back to the
cytosol and then diﬀuses into BSCs through plasmodesmata
along a steep concentration gradient. In the BSCs, malate is
transported into the chloroplast by an unknown transporter and
oxidatively decarboxylated by NADP-dependent malic enzyme
(NADP-ME), yielding CO 2, NADPH, and pyruvate. CO 2 is
assimilated by Rubisco, yielding two molecules of 3PGA, about
half of which is reduced to triose-phosphate (TPs) using the
NADPH provided by NADP-ME in the BSC chloroplast to
regenerate RuBP in the Calvin-Benson cycle. The other half
of the 3PGA moves to the MCs for reduction to TP in the
MC chloroplast and then returns to the BSCs to enter the
Calvin-Benson cycle. Pyruvate moves from the BSCs into the
chloroplasts of the MCs where it is converted to PEP by
pyruvate:phosphate dikinase (PPDK).
Previous attempts to introduce a single-cell C 4 pathway into
rice led to increased photoinhibition of photosynthesis, leaf
chlorophyll bleaching and serious stunting with no evidence
of CO 2 concentration in chloroplasts (Taniguchi et al., 2008;
Miyao et al., 2011). This work highlighted the need to achieve
the correct activity, regulation, kinetic properties, and location
of the enzymes. To address this, in this study, we report on
the introduction of part of two-celled biochemical pathway
into rice. It has previously been shown that genomic sequences
encoding C 4 proteins give stronger expression in rice than
cDNAs (Matsuoka et al., 1994). Therefore, we decided to express
1https://C4rice.com
individual full-length genes of ZmPEPC, ZmPPDK, ZmNADP-
MDH, and ZmNADP-ME (including promoters, untranslated
regions, exons, and introns) from maize (Kajala et al., 2011; Karki
et al., 2020) in a bid to achieve a C 4-like pattern of C 4 gene
expression, enzyme localization, enzyme activity, and enzyme
kinetic properties (Matsuoka et al., 1994; Miyao, 2003; Hibberd
and Covshoﬀ, 2010; Miyao et al., 2011). Individual lines were
then crossed to generate a plant overexpressing all four of these
core C4 cycle enzymes to investigate the feasibility of installing
a functional C 4 biochemical pathway into rice. This quadruple
transgenic line was also crossed with a line with decreased
OsGDCH protein (Lin et al., 2016). We investigated the eﬀect on
plant growth and photosynthesis.
To evaluate photosynthetic functionality, we used 13CO2
labeling experiments (Arrivault et al., 2017), similar in concept
to the radiolabeling experiments originally performed to
characterize ﬂux in C4 photosynthesis (Hatch et al., 1967; Hatch,
1971). Flux of 13CO2 through photosynthetic metabolism, in
particular into C 4 acids, was determined for the quadruple and
quintuple lines, compared to untransformed controls. We show
that there was increased labeling of C4 acids in both sets of plants
compared to wild type, consistent with partial low-level function
of a portion of the C4 pathway.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plant Materials
Individual transgenic lines were generated overexpressing four
of the core C 4 cycle enzymes required for a functional NADP-
ME C 4 cycle (Kajala et al., 2011; Supplementary Figure 1 ),
ZmPEPC (GRMZM2G083841), ZmPPDK (GRMZM2G306345),
ZmNADP-MDH (GRMZM2G129513), and ZmNADP-
ME (GRMZM2G085019. Generations of pSC0/ ZmPEPC,
pSC0/ZmPPDK, pSC0/ZmNADP-MDH, and pSC0/NADP-ME
vectors were previously described (Giuliani et al., 2019b; Karki
et al., 2020). In almost all cases, three independent single
insertion homozygous transgenic lines with high transgene
expression were selected for molecular and biochemical
evaluation. However, for ZmNADP-ME, protein expression
was only detected in a single transgenic line containing >6
copies of the overexpression construct and so this was the
only line that could be taken forward (Karki et al., 2020).
The overexpression constructs were stacked into single lines
through conventional crossing to create two triple cross line
(PEPC-28/PPDK-11/MDH-40 and PEPC-62/PPDK-2/MDH-22)
each with an independent transgenic event for each gene. The
crossing strategy was presented in Supplementary Figure 2 .
The ZmPEPC (PEPC-28 and PEPC-62) and ZmNADP-MDH
(MDH-40 and MDH-22) single transgenic lines were initially
crossed to create two double transgene lines (PEPC-28/MDH-
40 and PEPC-62/MDH-22) that were then crossed with the
ZmPPDK (PPDK-11 and PPDK-2) single transgenic lines.
These two triple lines (PEPC-28/PPDK-11/MDH-40 and
PEPC-62/PPDK-2/MDH-22) were then crossed with the
single ZmNADP-ME (ME-116) transgenic line to produce two
quadruple lines (PEPC-28/PPDK-11/MDH-40/ME-116 and

PEPC-62/PPDK-2/MDH-22/ME-116). Progeny of the PEPC-
28/PPDK-11/MDH-40 showed that detectable ZmPEPC localizes
to MCs, but progeny of the PEPC-62/PPDK-2/MDH-22 showed
that ZmPEPC localizes to both MCs and BSCs ( Supplementary
Figure 3 ). The PEPC-28/PPDK-11/MDH-40/ME-116 line
was selected for analysis in the present study since its parent
PEPC-28/PPDK-11/MDH-40 showed that correct ZmPEPC
MCs expression and its progenitor PEPC-28 had been detail
characterized in Giuliani et al. (2019b). Two quintuple crosses
(PEPC-28/PPDK-11/MDH-40/ME-116/gdch-31) and (PEPC-
28/PPDK-11/MDH-40/ME-116/gdch-38) were then generated
by crossing the quadruple F 2 line (PEPC-28/PPDK-11/MDH-
40/ME-116) with single Osgdch knockdown lines ( gdch-31 and
gdch-38) described by Lin et al. (2016). The PEPC-28/PPDK-
11/MDH-40/ME-116/gdch-38 line was chosen for analysis in
present study since its progenitor gdch-38 had shown a more
consistent photorespiratory-deﬁcient phenotype under diﬀerent
O2:CO2 growing and measuring conditions compared with
gdch-31 line, and had been detail characterized in Giuliani et al.
(2019a). The presence of transgenes was determined by genomic
PCR and protein accumulation by immunoblotting in each
crossed line (Supplementary Figures 4–6).
Plant Growth
Plants were grown under natural light conditions in a
screenhouse with a day/night temperature of 35/28 ±3◦C at
the International Rice Research Institute (Los Baños, Philippines:
14◦ 10019.900N, 121 ◦ 15022.300E). Maximum irradiance was
2000 µmol photons m−2 s−1 on a sunny day. Plants were grown
in 7-liter pots ﬁlled with soil from the IRRI upland farm.
Immunoblotting
Leaf samples for soluble protein extraction were harvested
from the youngest fully expanded leaf at the mid-tillering
stage between 09:00 h and 11:00 h, and stored on ice
immediately. Leaves were homogenized to a ﬁne powder
using a nitrogen-cooled mortar and pestle. Proteins were
extracted and fractionated by SDS-PAGE as described previously
(Lin et al., 2016). Samples were loaded based on equal leaf
area (0.2364 mm 2 for ZmPEPC and ZmPPDK, and 2.364
mm2 for ZmNADP-MDH, ZmNADP-ME and OsGDCH).
After electrophoresis, proteins were electroblotted onto a
polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membrane and probed with rabbit
antisera against ZmPEPC, ZmNADP-MDH, ZmNADP-ME
(all provided by Richard Leegood, University of Sheﬃeld,
United Kingdom), ZmPPDK (provided by Chris Chastain,
Minnesota State University, United States), and OsGDCH
protein (provided by Asaph Cousins, Washington State
University, United States). The dilutions of ZmPEPC, ZmPPDK,
ZmNADP-MDH, ZmNADP-ME, and OsGDCH antisera were
1:20,000, 1:20,000, 1:5,000, 1:2,000, and 1:100, respectively.
A peroxidase-conjugated goat anti-rabbit IgG secondary
antibody (Sigma-Aldrich, United States) 2 was used at a dilution
of 1:5,000 and immunoreactive bands were visualized with
2https://www.sigmaaldrich.com/
ECL Western Blotting Detection Reagents (GE Healthcare,
United Kingdom)3.
Immunolocalization
The middle portion of the youngest fully expanded leaf at the
mid-tillering stage was sampled between 09:00 h and 11:00 h
and processed as described previously by Lin et al. (2016). After
ﬁxation and cutting, the thin leaf sections were probed with the
antisera against ZmNADP-MDH, ZmNADP-ME, ZmPPDK, and
ZmPEPC at dilutions of 1:500, 1:25, 1:10, and 1:200, respectively.
The secondary Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rabbit IgG (Invitrogen,
United States) 4 antibody was used at a dilution of 1:200. The
sections were visualized on a BX61 microscope ﬁtted with a Disk
Scanning Unit attachment microscope (Olympus, United States)5
with ﬂuorescence function under DAPI, RFP , and GFP ﬁlters.
Enzyme Activity Measurement
Leaf samples were harvested between 09:00 h and 11:00 h from
the youngest fully expanded leaf of plants at the mid-tillering
stage, and frozen immediately. Leaves were homogenized to a ﬁne
powder using a nitrogen-cooled mortar and pestle and extracted
in 250 µL of buﬀer containing: 50 mM HEPES-KOH, pH 7.4,
5 mM MgCl 2, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM Dithiothreitol, 1% (v/v)
glycerol. After centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 2 min at 4 ◦C,
the supernatant was collected for enzyme activity measurements.
PEPC enzyme activity was assayed using a method modiﬁed
from Meyer et al. (1988) and Ueno et al. (1997). The PEPC
reaction mixture contained: 100 mM HEPES-NaOH, pH 7.5,
10 mM MgCl 2, 1 mM NaHCO 3, 5 mM G6P , 0.2 mM NADH,
12 unit/mL MDH (from pig heart; Roche Diagnostics, Basel,
Switzerland)6, and the reaction was started by adding PEP to a
ﬁnal concentration of 4 mM. PPDK enzyme activity was assayed
as described by Fukayama et al. (2001). NADP-MDH activity was
determined by a method modiﬁed from Tsuchida et al. (2001).
NADP-MDH reaction mixture contained: 50 mM HEPES-KOH,
pH 8, 70 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 0.2 mM
NADPH, and the reaction was started by adding OAA to a ﬁnal
concentration of 1 mM. NADP-ME activity was measured by a
method modiﬁed from Tsuchida et al. (2001; protocol 1). The
activities of PEPC, PPDK, NADP-MDH, and NADP-ME were
measured spectrophotometrically at 340 nm at 25◦C, 30◦C, 25◦C,
and 25◦C, respectively.
Gas Exchange Measurements
Leaf gas-exchange measurements were made using a Li-6400XT
infrared gas analyzer (LI-COR Biosciences, United States) 7 ﬁtted
with a standard 2 ×3 cm leaf chamber and a 6400-02B light
source. Measurements were made at a constant airﬂow rate
of 400 µmol s −1, leaf temperature of 25 ◦C, leaf-to-air vapor
pressure deﬁcit between 1.0 and 1.5 kPa and relative humidity
of 60ñ65%. Data were acquired between 08:00 h and 13:00 h.

Lin et al. C4 Biochemical Pathway in Rice
Measurements were made from the two youngest fully expanded
leaves for each plant during the tillering stage. The mid-portions
of leaves were acclimated in the cuvette for approximately 30 min
before measurements were made. The response curves of the
net CO 2 assimilation rate ( A, µmol m −2 s−1) to changing
intercellular pCO2 concentration (Ci, µmol CO2 mol air−1) were
acquired by decreasing Ca (pCO2 concentration in the cuvette)
from 2000 down to 20 µmol CO2 mol air−1 at a photosynthetic
photon ﬂux density (PPFD) of 1500 or 2000 µmol photon
m−2 s−1. The CO 2 compensation point ( 0) and maximum
carboxylation eﬃciency ( CE) were calculated from the intercept
(Vogan et al., 2007) and slope (Wang et al., 2006) of the
CO2 response curves. Light response curves were acquired by
increasing the PPFD from 0 to 2000 µmol photon m −2 s−1
at Ca 400 µbar. The quantum eﬃciency for CO 2 assimilation
(ϕ) and respiration rates ( Rd) were calculated from the slope
and intercept of the light-response curves (PPFD < 100 µmol
photons m−2 s−1).
13CO2 Pulse-Labeling and Quenching
Procedure
Carbon ﬂux analysis was performed with a custom-built gas
exchange freeze clamp apparatus ( Supplementary Figure 7 ).
Measurements were made from two youngest fully expanded
leaves for each plant during the tillering stage. Two leaves
of up to 22 cm in length were placed inside a gas exchange
chamber (23.5 cm ×4.5 cm ×0.4 cm), the top was constructed
from a piece of clear ﬂexible plastic to allow light penetration
and the bottom from a sheet of aluminum foil to accelerate
cooling when freeze clamping. The foil and plastic were attached
with foil tape to a three-sided aluminum frame to provide
rigidity. Two holes were drilled through the side of the frame
to accommodate the air inlet and outlet tubes. A third hole
on the end enabled thermocouples to be threaded through the
frame to measure leaf and air temperature inside the labeling
chamber. The chamber was then placed in a mounting frame
allowing the leaf to be inserted prior to sealing the chamber with
a foam gasket secured with bulldog clips. The mounting frame
was positioned horizontally between two LED banks capable
of providing illumination to the upper leaf surface of up to
1,000 µmol photons m2 s−1.
Air was drawn from outside the laboratory through a
compressor. The air stream passed through an oil water
separator and ﬂow control valve into a copper coil placed
in an ice bath for cooling. The air stream could be directed
into the leaf chamber or by-passed into a CO 2 conditioning
unit. In the latter, CO 2 could be removed from the air
with soda lime and then optionally enriched with 13CO2 gas
(300 ppm) prepared by mixing NaH 13CO3 (Sigma-Aldrich,
United States; see text footnote 2) with 2-hydroxypropanoic
acid (lactic acid). The ﬂow of air passing over the leaf
(3 ml/min) was adjusted with a ﬂow controller, and the
CO2 concentration of the incoming and outgoing air streams
measured with two CO 2 analyzers (WMA-5, PP-Systems,
United States) 8. The humidity of the air inside the chamber
8https://ppsystems.com/
was maintained at ∼60% with the addition of water to the
soda lime chamber or reduced by passing air through a
chamber of silica gel.
The leaf chamber was mounted on the stand in such a
way that the plane of the leaf was halfway between two
pneumatically operated aluminum bars. These were cooled with
liquid nitrogen, and when released they clamped together ﬁtting
inside the aluminum chamber frame, very rapidly freezing the
leaf. A fan was mounted horizontally to the bars to blow
the fog from the liquid nitrogen away from the chamber
to ensure there was minimal disruption to the environment
before freezing occurred. The lower bar was positioned in
such a way as to push the chamber up on closure. The cold
temperatures and force of the bars closing meant the chamber
disintegrated enabling the leaf to be removed with tweezers and
placed in a liquid nitrogen bath for 10 s before subsequent
storage at −80◦C. To perform 13CO2 pulse-labeling, leaves
were acclimated at steady-state conditions prior to scrubbing
CO2 from the incoming air stream, then subjected to 13CO2
enriched air for a duration of 0 and 60 s and metabolic
activity was quenched at these time points by freeze clamping
the leaves as above. Freeze-quenched tissue was ground into
a ﬁne powder by mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen. Finely
ground leaf tissues were freeze-dried for 3 days and placed
into sealed tubes. The sealed tubes containing ﬁnely ground
lyophilized leaf tissue samples were shipped to Max Planck
Institute of Molecular Plant Physiology, Germany for the
metabolite analyses.
Metabolite Analyses and Calculation of
Total Pool Size, Enrichment and
Isotopomer Distribution
Aliquots (3 or 5 mg) of ﬁnely ground lyophilized rice leaf
tissue were extracted with chloroform-methanol as described
in Arrivault et al. (2017), and the lyophilized extracts were
resuspended in 300 µL or 600 µL puriﬁed (Millipore,
United States) water, respectively. Isotopomers were measured
by reverse-phase LC-MS/MS (malate, aspartate, 3PGA, PEP ,
citrate + isocitrate; Arrivault et al., 2017; n.b. citrate and
isocitrate were not resolved using this method) and anion-
exchange LC-MS/MS (malate, PEP , citrate; Lunn et al., 2006
with modiﬁcations as described in Figueroa et al., 2016).
Total amounts of malate, aspartate, citrate +isocitrate, and
citrate were calculated by summing isotopomers. The total
amounts of 3PGA and PEP were determined enzymatically
in trichloroacetic acid extracts using a Sigma-22 dual-
wavelength photometer (Merlo et al., 1993), with PEP
being measured in freshly prepared extracts. 13C enrichment
and relative isotopomer distribution were calculated as in
Szecowka et al. (2013).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis for all experiments was performed in R
version 3.0.0 (The R Foundation for Statistical Computing,
Vienna, Austria) using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOV A)

and a Tukey post hoc test or a Student’s t-test with a
p-value of <0.05.
RESULTS
Overexpression of C4 Cycle Genes in
Oryza sativa
Immunoblotting of F 2 generation transgenic plants showed
that the protein of the correct size for ZmPEPC, ZmNADP-
MDH, ZmNADP-ME, and ZmPPDK was stably expressed
in both the quadruple and quintuple cross rice lines, with
OsGDCH protein almost undetectable in the quintuple cross
(Figure 1 ). In all lines, protein abundance was lower than
that of wild-type maize plants. We next sought to determine
whether these proteins were localized to the correct cell
type and subcellular compartment. Immunolocalization analysis
of the quadruple cross line revealed that ZmPEPC was
localized to the cytosol of MCs similar to the single ZmPEPC
transgenic line (Giuliani et al., 2019b) and the triple cross
line ( Supplementary Figure 3 ). ZmPPDK, was localized to
the chloroplast in both BSCs and MCs ( Supplementary
Figure 8 ). The ZmNADP-MDH and ZmNADP-ME antisera
cross-reacted with native protein in wild-type rice and so
it was not possible to distinguish protein encoded by the
endogenous rice gene from that encoded by the maize transgene.
Overexpression of these enzymes conferred enhanced enzyme
activity ( Supplementary Table 1 ). In the quadruple cross line,
PEPC activity was 18.4-fold higher compared to wild-type rice
plants, PPDK 5.8-fold higher, NADP-MDH 9.9-fold, and NADP-
ME 4.1-fold (Table 1).
Phenotypic and Photosynthetic
Perturbations Associated With
Overexpression of C4 Cycle Genes
Given that protein levels and activities of all four introduced
C4 enzymes were enhanced compared to wild-type plants, we
investigated whether this aﬀected growth and photosynthesis.
None of the crossed lines consistently showed altered chlorophyll
content (Figure 2A). Tiller number in the quintuple cross lines
(Figure 2B) and plant height in both quadruple and quintuple
crosses ( Figure 2C ) were signiﬁcantly reduced. Phenotypic
perturbations were most marked in the quintuple cross lines
(Supplementary Figure 9 ), although the plants still developed
and ﬂowered at the same time with wild-type plants. These
growth perturbations were not observed in the single C 4 gene
transgenic lines of ZmPEPC, ZmPPDK, ZmNADP-MDH, and
ZmNADP-ME (Giuliani et al., 2019b) but were observed in the
single Osgdch knockdown line (Lin et al., 2016).
To investigate whether overexpression of C 4 genes impacted
photosynthesis, the response of net CO 2 assimilation rate ( A)
to CO 2 concentration under photorespiratory conditions (21%
O2) was measured. In the quadruple cross line there were no
diﬀerences in CO 2 assimilation (Figures 3A,C), 0, CE, Rd or 8
compared to wild-type plants ( Table 2). These results suggested
FIGURE 1 |Soluble leaf protein. Immunoblots for (A) Quadruple and (B) Quintuple crosses. Maize (Zm), wild-type rice (WT), and plants of F2 crosses (numbers).
Protein was extracted from the youngest fully expanded leaf at mid-tillering stage. Samples were loaded on an equal leaf area basis (0.2364 mm2 for ZmPEPC and

that accumulation of active maize C 4 cycle enzymes in rice does
not signiﬁcantly aﬀect leaf level photosynthetic gas-exchange and
that the phenotypic perturbations are not associated with reduced
CO2 assimilation.
For the quintuple cross, the CO2 assimilation rate in response
to increasing intercellular CO2 concentrations (Ci) was reduced,
most notably at lower CO 2 concentrations ( <700 µmol CO 2
mol−1, Figure 3B ). Under non-photorespiratory conditions
(2% O 2, Figure 3B ) CO 2 assimilation rates were similar to
wild-type plants. Consistent with this, the quintuple cross
had a signiﬁcantly higher 0 under high photorespiratory
conditions but not under low photorespiratory conditions
(Table 2 ). In response to changes in photon ﬂux density,
photosynthesis was saturated at lower light levels than
in wild-type plants (400 µmol photons m −2 s−1 versus
1750 µmol photons m −2 s−1, respectively, Figure 3D )
with signiﬁcantly lower 8 and higher Rd than wild-type
plants (Table 2).
To investigate these photosynthetic responses for the
quintuple cross line in more detail, CO 2 responses were
measured under conditions conducive to low and high
rates of photorespiration. Under low light (400 µmol
photons m −2 s−1) and high CO 2 (2000 µmol CO 2 mol
air−1), conditions conducive to low photorespiration,
CO2 responses of the quintuple cross line were similar to
wild-type plants ( Supplementary Figures 10A,D ). Under
high light (1500 µmol photons m −2 s−1) and low CO 2
(400 µmol CO 2 mol air −1), conditions conducive to high
photorespiration, CO 2 assimilation was lower in the quintuple
cross ( Supplementary Figures 10B,C ). Correspondingly, 0
was higher, and carboxylation eﬃciency ( CE) lower under
conditions conductive to high rates of photorespiration but
not under non-photorespiratory conditions ( Supplementary
Table 1). This is consistent with the photorespiratory-deﬁcient
phenotype observed in the single Osgdch knockdown lines
(Lin et al., 2016).

the quadruple and quintuple cross lines than in wild-type
plants ( Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 11 ), with the m1
isotopomer being more abundant than the other 13C-labeled
isotopomers ( Table 3 ), consistent with increased ﬁxation of
13CO2 via PEPC in the transgenic lines expressing the maize
PEPC enzyme. Labeling of aspartate was also signiﬁcantly
higher than wild-type in the quintuple line ( Figure 4 and
Supplementary Figure 11 ), with the m1 isotopomer being
more abundant that m2-m4 isotopomers ( Table 3), indicating
13CO2 ﬁxation into oxaloacetate by maize PEPC and conversion
to aspartate by endogenous rice aspartate aminotransferase
activity. There was no evidence of signiﬁcant diﬀerence in
labeling of aspartate in the quadruple line. There was almost
complete labeling of the 3PGA pool in wild-type plants
after a 60 s pulse, and similarly high levels of labeling
of 3PGA were observed in the quadruple and quintuple
lines ( Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 11 ). There was
also substantial labeling of PEP after a 60 s pulse, with
no signiﬁcant diﬀerences between the transgenic lines and
wild-type plants ( Figure 4 and Supplementary Figure 11 ).
There was almost no labeling of citrate and isocitrate in
wild-type plants and the quadruple line ( Figure 4 ). In
contrast, the enrichment of 13C in citrate and isocitrate
in the quintuple line was 10-fold higher than in wild-
type plants.
DISCUSSION
We have previously shown that overproduction of individual C 4
enzymes in rice has no consistent eﬀect on CO 2 assimilation
or plant growth (Giuliani et al., 2019b; Karki et al., 2020).

The exception to this was the transgenic line overexpressing
ZmNADP-ME which exhibited a small decrease in plant height
and reduced maximal photosynthetic rate at high CO 2. Previous
attempts to overproduce ZmNADP-ME in rice have led to
increased photoinhibition of photosynthesis, leaf chlorophyll
bleaching and serious stunting attributed to an increase in
the NADPH/NADP + ratio in the chloroplast stroma due to
the exchange with 2-oxoglutarate involved in photorespiration
(Tsuchida et al., 2001). Severe phenotypic eﬀects were not
observed in our ZmNADP-ME line; however, we were only able
to advance a single line containing 6 copies of the construct
in which protein accumulation was higher than in our rice
control, but still only around 10% of the activity found in
maize. In contrast, the experiments of Tsuchida et al. (2001)
used a rice chlorophyll a/b binging protein ( cab) promoter
allowed for high level but not cell speciﬁc expression, and
activities of up to 60% of maize levels were achieved, leading
to a much more severe phenotype. Overproduction of all four
targeted C 4 enzymes in a single plant led to a slight decrease
in tiller number and plant height but otherwise growth and
photosynthesis were unaﬀected. These results are consistent with
previous reports of engineering a single-cell C 4 pathway in rice
(Taniguchi et al., 2008). A quintuple cross that combined over-
expression of the four C 4 enzymes, ZmPEPC, ZmNADP-MDH,
ZmNADP-ME, and ZmPPDK with knockdown of the native rice
OsGDCH, thereby compromising the photorespiratory pathway,
led to further reductions in tiller number and plant height.
A strong negative eﬀect on photosynthesis was also observed in
the quintuple cross consistent with the photorespiratory-deﬁcient
phenotype of the single Osgdch knockdown line (Lin et al., 2016).
Our results show that ZmPEPC is catalytically active in vivo
when expressed in combination with other C 4 enzymes in rice,
and substantially increases the ﬁxation of CO2 into C4 acids. This
is in contrast to published radiolabeling studies of rice expressing
ZmPEPC alone (Fukayama et al., 2003; Miyao et al., 2011) in
which there was no increase in incorporation of labeled carbon
into C 4 acids, despite the extractable activity of PEPC in these
plants approaching or exceeding maize levels. Despite strong
evidence for operation of a partial C 4 pathway in our transgenic
lines up to the point of malate production, there was no evidence
for the regeneration of PEP via the rest of the C 4 cycle. The
labeling of PEP at a similar level in all three genotypes, wild-type,
quadruple and quintuple crosses, suggests that rather than being
produced by a functional C 4 cycle, PEP is being produced from
3PGA via 2PGA catalyzed by phosphoglyceromutase and enolase
(Furbank and Leegood, 1984), consistent with the majority of
CO2 still being ﬁxed via Rubisco in C3 photosynthesis rather than
through the operation of a complete C4 cycle.
The very low incorporation of 13C into citrate and isocitrate
in wild-type rice plants is consistent with previous studies
(Tcherkez et al., 2009; Szecowka et al., 2013) indicating
little ﬂux of carbon into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle
via mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (mPDH) in the
light, due to deactivation of the mPDH by phosphorylation
(Randall et al., 1996; Tovar-Méndez et al., 2003). The increased
labeling of citrate in the quintuple cross line suggests that
the mPDH is more active in the light in this line, potentially
leading to respiration of C 4 acids via the TCA cycle, which
would be deleterious for C 4 photosynthetic ﬂux. This might
be due to lower rates of photorespiration leading to less
photophosphorylation of PDH (Tovar-Méndez et al., 2003).
Further, increased levels of pyruvate in the mitochondria (from
decarboxylation of malate by NAD-malic enzyme), can inhibit
the mPDK kinase (Schuller and Randall, 1990). We propose
that there is a modiﬁed regulation of the TCA cycle to avoid
wasteful respiration of C 4 acids, and that such modiﬁcation
might have been needed for the evolution of an eﬃcient C 4
photosynthetic pathway.
Evidence that ZmPEPC can be localized to the cytosol of
MCs (Giuliani et al., 2019b) and is catalytically active, leading to
the ﬁxation of CO 2 into C 4 acids provides important evidence
in support of installing a fully functional C 4 photosynthetic
pathway into rice. However, absolute quantiﬁcation of ﬂux into
and through C4 acids would require further pulse-chase labeling
studies and may prove diﬃcult with the low rates of labeling
relative to C 3 photosynthetic ﬁxation obtained in the current
transgenic lines.
Achieving the correct cellular localization of the C 4 enzymes
introduced into the rice lines shown here remains an important
and unresolved issue. We introduced intact maize C 4-speciﬁc
genes containing the promoter into rice (Karki et al., 2020)
based on the strategy by Miyao et al. (2011). This approach
was originally adopted because it had been reported that the
5′- ﬂanking region of the maize C 4 speciﬁc genes drove high-
level MC-speciﬁc expression of a reporterβ-glucuronidase (GUS)
gene in rice leaves (Matsuoka et al., 1993, 1994). However, we
knew at the time that this approach might not lead to cell
speciﬁc expression of the enzymes (Sheen and Bogorad, 1987;
Frontiers in Plant Science | www.frontiersin.org 9 October 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 564463

Lin et al. C4 Biochemical Pathway in Rice
Nomura et al., 2005). Miyao et al. (2011) had reported that
expression of the native promoter and full-length maize PPDK
gene in rice led to the accumulation of protein in both the MCs
and BSCs. At the same time they also raised the possibility that
maize PEPC might also accumulate in both cell types, Therefore,
it was not unexpected that in the lines reported here, or the
single transgenic lines used as parents for the crosses in this study
(Karki et al., 2020), PPDK and PEPC accumulated in both cell
types, It remains unclear why in selected events, maize PEPC
appears to conﬁned the BS (Giuliani et al., 2019b). Owing to
the absence antibodies speciﬁc for ZmNADP-ME and ZmNADP-
MDH, we have been unable to establish the cell localization of
these enzymes. However, given that the promoters used, cell-
speciﬁc expression seems unlikely (Nomura et al., 2005).
To mitigate the risk associated with this approach we also
generated constructs where each coding sequence (CDS) was
fused to either the M promoter ZmPEPC (Matsuoka et al., 1993)
or the BS promoter OsPCK1 (Nomura et al., 2005) with the
nopaline synthase (nos) terminator at the 3′end. These lines were
not used as neither approach led to the cell speciﬁc expression
(unpublished, W. P. Quick, personal communication). As no
alternative strategy for achieving cell-speciﬁc expression was
available at the time, lines containing the full length genes and
native promoters were used as these lead to an enrichment
of maize PEPC and PDDK in the correct cell type. Incorrect
or partial localization of enzymes would potentially limit the
operation of a C4 cycle (Miyao et al., 2011), with the potential to
lead to deleterious phenotypes, i.e., (Tsuchida et al., 2001). Thus,
the cell-speciﬁc expression of enzymes remains an active area
of research for the consortium. It has been suggested that gene
speciﬁcity may be generated by elements that are not present in
the promoter (Hibberd and Covshoﬀ, 2010).
In addition to high level, cell speciﬁc expression of C 4 cycle
enzymes in rice, fully functional C4 photosynthetic biochemistry
requires appropriate enzyme regulation in the environment of a
rice leaf cell (Burnell and Hatch, 1985; Chastain et al., 1997). For
example, the activity of C4 speciﬁc PPDK is regulated in the light
through protein phosphorylation by the PPDK regulatory protein
(Burnell and Hatch, 1985). Similarly, NADP-MDH is regulated
by light through the thioredoxin cascade (Miginiac-Maslow et al.,
2000). Both enzymes are regulated in the same manner even when
expressed within C 3 leaves (Fukayama et al., 2001; Taniguchi
et al., 2008). A recent study has shown that C 4 NADP-ME
is also regulated in the light by reversible phosphorylation at
Ser419 which is involved in the binding of NADP at the active
site (Bovdilova et al., 2019). In contrast, PEPC is regulated by
both metabolite eﬀectors and reversible phosphorylation, but the
mechanisms of regulation in C3 and C4 leaves are diﬀerent (Vidal
and Chollet, 1997). Indeed, Fukayama et al. (2003) observed
inappropriate phosphorylation of PEPC in their transgenic rice
lines and proposed this as a reason for lack of labeling of C 4
acids in the light. The regulatory mechanisms for other enzymes
are less well understood. It is unclear at present whether enzyme
levels per se or enzyme regulation in our rice transgenic lines, or
both, is limiting C4 ﬂux.
In NADP-ME C4 plants assimilation of a single CO2 molecule
requires at least 10 transport steps between cells and within
subcellular compartments of the MC and BSC. The identity
of most of the transporter proteins supporting is now known,
although there remains some uncertainty about malate import to
the BS chloroplast and the export of pyruvate following malate
decarboxylation (Weber and von Caemmerer, 2010; Ermakova
et al., 2019). The next logical step is to introduce these into the
current prototype. This was initially planned and the started as
part of a 6-year strategy to develop a prototype expressing all
known genes required to support the C 4 biochemical pathway.
Since then the emergence of Golden Gate cloning has enabled
the consortium to reduce that strategy to 6-months by creating
a large multigene overexpression construct (Ermakova et al.,
2019). This makes the prototype development strategy adopted
in this study obsolete.
A plethora of other changes are required to support a fully
functional C4 pathway in rice. This includes, but is not limited
to, engineering the correct leaf anatomy (Hattersley and Watson,
1975; Dengler et al., 1994; Dengler and Taylor, 2000; Muhaidat
et al., 2007) and morphological specializations such as increased
vein density (Sedelnikova et al., 2018). In addition, thought
must be given to the photosynthetic functionalization of the
BSCs of rice, which contain a large central vacuole, with very
few mitochondria, peroxisomes or chloroplasts (Sage and Sage,
2009; Ermakova et al., 2019). Where chloroplasts do occur,
they are smaller than those in MCs. Increasing chloroplast
number and volume in the BSCs will no doubt be important
for achieving C 4 photosynthesis in rice (Chonan, 1970, 1978;
Dengler et al., 1994; Ueno et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2017).
Insuﬃcient chloroplast volume in the BSCs of rice may have
led to limitations in C 4 acid decarboxylation in the transgenic
lines described here. In addition, MCs of rice are highly lobed
to assist with photorespiratory CO 2 scavenging (Sage and Sage,
2009); whereas the MCs of C 4 species are not. It is possible that
these features may hinder the transport of metabolites between
cells (Sage and Sage, 2009). Other modiﬁcations such as cross-
sectional area of the BSCs, modifying the cell wall properties
for diﬀusion of CO 2 (von Caemmerer and Furbank, 2003) and
increasing plasmodesmatal frequency at the BSC/MC interface
to support metabolite diﬀusion may be necessary (Ermakova
et al., 2019). The genetic regulators of many of these changes
are not known, and so future goals include identiﬁcation and
incorporation of necessary genes for anatomical modiﬁcations
into a version of the current biochemical prototype, with the
ultimate goal of engineering an eﬃcient C 4 pathway in rice. The
research presented here represents a small step toward this goal.
