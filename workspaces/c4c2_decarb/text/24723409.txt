Abstract
Most physiology comparisons of C3 and C4 plants are made under current or elevated concentrations of atmospheric 
CO2 which do not reflect the low CO 2 environment under which C 4 photosynthesis has evolved. Accordingly, pho-
tosynthetic nitrogen (PNUE) and water (PWUE) use efficiency, and the activity of the photosynthetic carboxylases 
[Rubisco and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC)] and decarboxylases [NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME) and 
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEP-CK)] were compared in eight C4 grasses with NAD-ME, PCK, and NADP-ME 
subtypes, one C3 grass, and one C3–C4 grass grown under ambient (400 μl l–1) and glacial (180 μl l–1) CO2. Glacial CO2 
caused a smaller reduction of photosynthesis and a greater increase of stomatal conductance in C 4 relative to C 3 
and C3–C4 species. Panicum bisulcatum (C 3) acclimated to glacial [CO 2] by doubling Rubisco activity, while Rubisco 
was unchanged in Panicum milioides (C 3–C4), possibly due to its high leaf N and Rubisco contents. Glacial CO 2 up-
regulated Rubisco and PEPC activities in concert for several C4 grasses, while NADP-ME and PEP-CK activities were 
unchanged, reflecting the high control exerted by the carboxylases relative to the decarboxylases on the efficiency of 
C4 metabolism. Despite having larger stomatal conductance at glacial CO2, C4 species maintained greater PWUE and 
PNUE relative to C3–C4 and C3 species due to higher photosynthetic rates. Relative to other C4 subtypes, NAD-ME and 
PEP-CK grasses had the highest PWUE and PNUE, respectively; relative to C3, the C3–C4 grass had higher PWUE and 
similar PNUE at glacial CO2. Biomass accumulation was reduced by glacial CO 2 in the C3 grass relative to the C3–C4 
grass, while biomass was less reduced in NAD-ME grasses compared with NADP-ME and PCK grasses. Under glacial 
CO
2, high resource use efficiency offers a key evolutionary advantage for the transition from C3 to C4 photosynthesis 
in water- and nutrient-limited environments.
Key words: C 3, C3–C4, and C4 photosynthesis, glacial CO2, NAD-ME, NADP-ME, PEPC, PEP-CK, Rubisco, water and nitrogen 
use efficiency.
Introduction
The decline in atmospheric CO2 concentration ([CO2]) in the 
late Oligocene (30 million years ago) is considered to be the 
primary driver for the evolution of the C 4 photosynthetic 
pathway (Christin et al., 2008; Ehleringer et al., 1997; Sage 
et  al., 2012). Geological fluctuations in atmospheric [CO 2] 
have shaped the Earth’s vegetation, yet relatively little is 
known about the responses of C
4 plants to the low [CO2] levels 
that dominated during their evolution, and that are close to 
the atmospheric [CO
2] of the recent glaciation (Pagani et al., 
2005). Low [CO 2] promotes high rates of photorespiration 
and reduces the carboxylation efficiency of C 3 photosynthe-
sis. The key feature of C 4 photosynthesis is the operation of 
a CO 2-concentrating mechanism (CCM) which suppresses 
photorespiration by raising [CO2] around Rubisco (ribulose-
1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase). During C4 photo-
synthesis, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) catalyses 
the initial carboxylation of CO
2 into organic C 4 acids in the 
mesophyll. Decarboxylation of C4 acids in the bundle sheath 
releases CO2 for refixation by Rubisco (Hatch, 1987). The C4 
photosynthetic pathway is classified into three biochemical

subtypes based on the primary C 4 decarboxylase enzyme. 
These enzymes are NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME), 
NAD-malic enzyme (NAD-ME), and phosphoenolpyruvate 
carboxykinase (PEP-CK, also known as PCK) (Gutierrez 
et  al., 1974; Kanai and Edwards, 1999). There are strong 
anatomical and biochemical variations associated with these 
biochemical subtypes (Prendergast et al., 1987; Dengler et al., 
1994; Edwards and Voznesenskaya, 2011).
The operation of a CCM enhances the efficiency of C
4 
relative to C3 photosynthesis (Osmond, 1982). In particular, 
C4 species attain higher photosynthetic water use efficiency 
(PWUE) because lower stomatal conductance (gs) and inter-
cellular [CO2] (Ci) are needed to saturate Rubisco carboxy-
lation. C4 plants achieve higher photosynthetic nitrogen use 
efficiency (PNUE) due to their lower leaf N requirement as a 
result of a higher Rubisco catalytic turnover rate (k
cat) (Long, 
1999; Taylor et al., 2010; Ghannoum et al., 2011). Variations 
in resource use efficiency also occur among the C 4 subtypes 
(Ghannoum et al., 2011). For example, NADP-ME grasses 
tend to have lower leaf N content than their NAD-ME coun-
terparts (Bowman, 1991; Knapp and Medina, 1999; Taub and 
Lerdau, 2000), as a result of faster Rubisco k
cat in NADP-ME 
species (Ghannoum et  al., 2005). Furthermore, Ghannoum 
et  al. (2002) showed that under water stress, NAD-ME 
grasses increased their whole-plant WUE to a greater extent 
than NADP-ME counterparts. These aforementioned stud-
ies were undertaken under current ambient [CO
2] which does 
not reflect the low CO 2 environment under which C4 grasses 
have evolved. Hence, the main aim of the current study was to 
investigate whether previously reported physiological differ -
ences among the C
4 subtypes at ambient [CO 2] are similarly 
observed at glacial [CO2].
Growth at low [CO 2] reduces growth and photosynthesis 
of C3 plants. C3 plants respond to low [CO2] by increasing gs 
to improve CO2 supply and by up-regulating photosynthetic 
enzymes to improve CO2 capture (Polley et al., 1992; Dippery 
et al., 1995; Tissue et al., 1995; Gesch et al., 2000; Anderson 
et al., 2001). The occurrence of a CCM in C 4 leaves makes 
the C4 pathway less limited by CO 2 supply and, hence, less 
likely to respond and acclimate to growth at low [CO 2] rela-
tive to C 3 photosynthesis (Hatch, 1987; Gerhart and Ward, 
2010). Nevertheless, increased leaf N content and gs have 
been observed under low [CO2] in some C4 species (Anderson 
et al., 2001; Maherali et al., 2002). To the authors’ knowledge 
there are no published studies comparing the impact of low 
[CO
2] on the photosynthetic gas exchange or biochemistry of 
C4 grasses with different biochemical subtypes. The current 
study aims at addressing this knowledge gap.
A hypothezised intermediate stage during C 4 evolution, 
known as C3–C4 intermediate, restricts the activity of glycine 
decarboxylase to the bundle sheath (Sage et al., 2012), thus 
improving Rubisco efficiency by facilitating the recapture 
of photorespired CO
2 (Monson and Moore, 1989; Monson 
and Rawsthorne, 2000). The operation of a photorespira-
tory pump in C 3–C4 photosynthesis is expected to elicit a 
response to [CO 2] that is intermediate between C 3 and C 4 
photosynthesis (Monson and Rawsthorne, 2000; Sage et al., 
2012). Under low [CO2], C3–C4 plants have been reported to 
maintain greater photosynthetic rates, PWUE, and PNUE 
relative to C
3 species (Ku and Edwards, 1978; Bolton and 
Brown, 1980; Ku et  al., 1991; Monson and Rawsthorne, 
2000; Vogan et al., 2007; Pinto et al., 2011; Vogan and Sage, 
2012). The current study seeks to determine how C 3–C4 
species perform relative to the various C 4 subtypes at low 
[CO2].
Comparing the sensitivity to glacial [CO 2] of the different 
pathways of photosynthesis and subtypes of C 4 photosyn-
thesis among closely related grass species may provide criti-
cal insight into the physiology of C
4 plants under conditions 
that led to their evolution. Consequently, this study com-
pared the photosynthetic physiology (PWUE and PNUE) 
and biochemistry (activity of the photosynthetic carboxylase 
and decarboxylase enzymes) in C
4 grasses with different bio-
chemical subtypes grown under ambient (400 μl l–1) or glacial 
(180 μl l–1) [CO2]. Closely related C3 and C3–C4 grass species 
were included for comparison.
Materials and methods
Plant culture
Two matched growth chambers (1.8 m 3 each; BioChambers, 
Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada) were used in this study. The cham-
bers were maintained at either glacial (180 μl l–1) or ambient (400 μl 
l–1) [CO 2]. Low [CO 2] was achieved by passing incoming air over 
a CO 2 absorbent (Grace SodaSorb, WR Grace and Co.-Conn., 
Chicago, USA) and controlled by CO 2 gas analysers (LI-820, 
LI-COR, Lincoln, NE, USA). The average growth conditions dur -
ing the experiment are shown in Table 1.
Locally collected soil (Ghannoum et  al., 2010) was air-dried, 
coarsely sieved, and added (3.7 kg) to 3.5 l cylindrical pots, which 
were watered to 100% capacity, then transferred to the two growth 
chambers. Seeds for the grass species used in this study (Table 2) were 
obtained from the Australian Plant Genetic Resources Information 
System (ACT, Australia) and Queensland Agricultural Seeds Pty. 
Ltd (Toowoomba, Australia). Seeds were sown in trays containing 
a common germination mix. Three to four weeks after germination, 
three seedlings were transplanted into each of the soil-filled pots. 
Within a week of transplanting, one healthy seedling was left in the 
pot while the other seedlings were removed; there were four pots per 
species and CO
2 treatment. Two environmentally controlled growth 
chambers were used to generate the CO2 treatments. In order to min-
imize the impact of having a single growth chamber per CO 2 treat-
ment, pots and CO2 treatments were switched between chambers on 
two occasions. In addition, pots were randomly rotated within each 
chamber on a weekly basis throughout the experiment. Plants were

watered daily and a commercial fertilizer (General Purpose, Thrive 
Professional, Yates, Australia) was applied weekly (0.2 g N l–1).
Leaf gas exchange measurements
Gas exchange measurements were made using a portable open gas 
exchange system (LI-6400XT, LI-COR). At 7–8 weeks after trans-
planting, gas exchange measurements were made at a photosynthetic 
photon flux density of 1800 μmol m
–2 s–1 between 10:00 h and 14:00 h 
on attached, last fully expanded leaves (LFELs) of the main stems. 
Spot measurements of the light-saturated photosynthetic rate (A
sat) 
and gs were made at target growth [CO2] (180 μl l–1 or 400 μl l–1) and 
leaf temperature of 27 ºC. Leaf-to-air vapour pressure deficit ranged 
between 1.7 kPa and 2.4 kPa during the measurements. Before each 
measurement, the leaf was allowed to stabilize for 10–20 min until it 
reached a steady state of CO
2 uptake.
The responses of CO 2 assimilation rates (A) to step increases of 
Ci were measured under conditions similar to spot measurements by 
raising the cuvette [CO 2] in 10 steps between 50  μl l–1 and 1500  μl 
l–1. There were 3–4 replicates per treatment. The A–C i curves were 
fitted using the C4 photosynthesis model (von Caemmerer, 2000) to 
estimate maximal PEPC (in vivo V pmax) and Rubisco (in vivo V cmax) 
activities. The biochemical model of C 3 photosynthesis was used 
to estimate V cmax (apparent, maximal RuBP-carboxylation limited 
rate) for the C 3 grass (Farquhar et al., 1980), using Rubisco cata-
lytic parameters obtained for Panicum bisulcatum (RE Sharwood, O 
Ghannoum, and SM Whitney, unpublished).
Growth and nitrogen analyses
Plants were harvested 12–13 weeks after transplanting. At harvest, 
the area of the LFELs and total leaf area were measured using a 
leaf area meter (LI-3100A, LI-COR). Shoots were separated into 
stems and leaves. Roots were washed free of soil. Plant materials 
were oven-dried at 80  ºC for 48 h before dry mass was measured. 
Leaf mass per area (LMA, g m
–2) was calculated as total leaf dry 
mass/total leaf area. For each treatment, three dried LFELs of each 
species were milled to a fine powder. Tissue N was determined on 
the ground samples using a CHN analyser (LECO TruSpec, LECO 
Corporation, MI, USA).
Activity of Rubisco, PEPC, NADP-ME, and PEP-CK
Following gas exchange measurements made at growth [CO
2], repli-
cate leaf discs (1–2 cm2) were cut under high light and rapidly frozen 
in liquid nitrogen then stored at –80  °C for biochemical analysis. 
Each leaf disc was extracted in 1 ml of ice-cold extraction buffer 
[50 mM EPPS-NaOH pH 8.0, 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 15 mM 
NaHCO3, 20 mM MgCl2, 2 mM EDTA, 4% (v/v) protease inhibitor 
cocktail (Sigma), and 1% (w/v) polyvinylpolypyrrolidone (PVPP)] 
using a 2 ml Potter–Elvehjem glass homogenizer kept on ice. 
Subsamples (75 μl) were taken from the total extract for SDS–PAGE 
analysis of total leaf protein. The remaining extract was centrifuged 
at 16 100 g for 1 min and the supernatant used for enzyme activity, 
Rubisco content, and soluble protein assays. Rubisco content was 
estimated by the irreversible binding of [
14C]carboxyarabinitol bis-
phosphate (CABP) to the fully carbamylated enzyme (Ruuska et al., 
1998). Rubisco activity (in vitro Vcmax) was estimated by multiplying 
the concentration of active sites determined using the [ 14C]CABP 
assay by the in vitro turnover rate (k cat at 25 °C) of the various C 4 
grasses (Supplementary Table S1 available at JXB online). Activities 
of PEPC and NADP-ME enzymes were determined at 25 °C using 
a UV-VIS spectrophotometer (model 8453, Agilent Technologies 
Australia, Mulgrave, Victoria) as previously described by Pengelly 
et al. (2012) and Ashton et al. (1990). Soluble proteins were meas-
ured using the Pierce Coomassie Plus (Bradford) protein assay kit 
(Thermo Scientific, Rockford, IL, USA).
PEP-CK activity was assayed at 25 °C in the carboxylase direction 
(Walker et al., 2002). Each leaf disc was extracted in 1 ml of ice-cold 
extraction buffer [50 mM HEPES pH 7.2, 5 mM DTT, 2 mM EDTA, 
2 mM MnCl
2, 0.05% Triton, 4% (v/v) protease inhibitor cocktail 
(Sigma), and 1% (w/v) PVPP] using a 2 ml Potter–Elvehjem glass 
homogenizer kept on ice. The extract was centrifuged at 16 100 g for 
1 min and the supernatant was used. PEP-CK activity was measured 
in assay buffer containing 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.0, 4% mercaptoe-
thanol (w/v), 100 mM KCl, 90 mM NaHCO
3, 1 mM ADP, 2 mM 
MnCl2, 0.14 mM NADH, and malate dehydrogenase after the addi-
tion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to 5 mM. It was not possible to 
assay reliably for NAD-ME activity in this study.
Immunoblot analysis
To confirm the presence or absence of assayed enzyme activities, 
especially the decarboxylases in the C4 species and PEPC in C 3 and 
C3–C4 species, immunoblot analysis of the proteins in question was 
carried out. Subsamples of total leaf extracts (used for enzyme 
assays) were mixed with 0.25 vol of 4× LDS buffer (Invitrogen) 
containing 100 mM DTT, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and 
stored at –20 °C until analysed. Protein samples were separated by 
SDS–PAGE at 200 V using TGX Any kD (Bio-Rad Laboratories, 
Hercules, CA, USA) pre-cast polyacrylamide gels in the Mini-
Protean apparatus buffered with TRIS-glycine SDS buffer (Bio-
Rad). Separated proteins were transferred at 4 °C to nitrocellulose 
membranes (0.45  μm; Bio-Rad) using the Xcell Surelock western 
transfer module (Invitrogen) buffered with 1× Transfer buffer [20×; 
25 mM Bicine, 25 mM Bis-Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 20% (v/v) methanol]. 
After 1 h of transfer at 30 V , the membrane was placed in blocking 
solution [3% (w/v) skim milk powder in TRIS-buffered saline (TBS); 
50 mM TRIS-HCl pH 8, 150 mM NaCl] for 1 h at room temperature 
with gentle agitation.
For immunoblot analysis, primary antisera raised in rabbit 
against tobacco Rubisco (prepared by SM Whitney) were diluted 
1:4000 in TBS before incubation at 1 h with membranes at room 
temperature with gentle agitation. Antiserum raised against PEPC 
(Cat. AS09 458) was obtained from Agrisera (Agrisera AB, Vännäs, 
Sweden) and diluted 1:2000 with TBS. For immunoblot analysis of 
NADP-ME and PEP-CK, synthetic peptides based on monocot 
amino acid sequences for each were synthesized by GL Biochem 
[GL Biochem (Shanghai) Ltd., Shanghai, China] and antiserum was 
raised to each peptide in rabbits. The reactive antisera were antigen 
purified and used for immunoblots (GL Biochem). The NADP-ME 
(Product ID A-003198) and PEP-CK (Product ID A-003200) anti-
sera were diluted in TBS 1:1000 and 1:500, respectively. All primary 
antisera were incubated with membranes at room temperature 
for 1 h with gentle agitation before washing three times with TBS. 
Secondary goat anti-rabbit antisera conjugated to horseradish per -
oxidase (HRP; Cat. NEF 812001EA, Perkin Elmer) were diluted 
1:3000 in TBS and incubated with the membranes for 1 h at room 
temperature followed by three washes with TBS. Immunoreactive 
peptides were detected using the Immun-Star Western C kit (Cat.

(Bio-Rad).
Statistical and data analysis
PWUE was calculated as Asat (μmol m–2 s–1)/gs (mol m–2 s–1). PNUE 
was calculated as A sat (μmol m –2 s –1)/leaf [N] area (mmol m –2). The 
proportion of leaf N invested in Rubisco (Rubisco-N) was calcu-
lated by assuming that Rubisco contained 16% N on a mass basis 
(Evans and Seemann, 1989).
There were four replicates per treatment for growth, gas 
exchange, and enzyme assay measurements. There were three rep-
licate measurements for the leaf N analysis and the A –C
i curves. 
The relationship between the various response variables and the 
main effects (species, photosynthetic type, and CO
2 treatment) and 
their interactions were fitted using a linear model in R (V . 3.0.2; 
R Foundation for statistical computing, Vienna, Austria). Analysis 
of variance (ANOV A; summarized in Table 2) was conducted for 
each fitted model. Multiple comparisons (shown in Table  4 and 
Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online) of species means were 
made using the Tukey test.
Results
Photosynthetic rates and WUE
Under both [CO2] treatments, photosynthetic rates measured 
at high light and growth [CO2] (Asat) were higher in the C4 spe-
cies relative to the C3–C4 and C3 species. Amongst the C4 spe-
cies, variation in Asat was unrelated to their subtype. Relative 
to ambient [CO 2], glacial [CO 2] decreased A sat to a greater 
extent in the C3–C4 (65%) and C3 (60%) species relative to the 
C4 species (26%) (Figs 1A, 2A; Table 3; Supplementary Table 
S1 at JXB online).

Photosynthesis of C3, C3–C4, and C4 grasses at glacial CO2 | 3673
At ambient [CO2], variation in gs was unrelated to the pho-
tosynthetic type or subtype of the grasses. At glacial [CO 2], 
the C 4 species had higher g s relative to the C 3 and C 3–C4 
counterparts. Glacial [CO2] increased gs to a greater extent in 
the C4 relative to the C 3 (1.1-fold) and C 3–C4 (1.3-fold) spe-
cies, with NADP-ME (1.5-fold) grasses showing the greatest 
increase in gs relative to the other C4 species (1.35-fold) (Figs 
1B, 2B; Table 3; Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online).
At ambient [CO 2], PWUE was higher in the C 4 relative 
to the two C 3–C4 and C 3 species. At glacial [CO 2], PWUE 
was highest in NAD-ME and PCK species, intermediate in 
NADP-ME and C
3–C4, and lowest in C 3 species. Amongst 
the C4 species, the two NAD-ME grasses had higher PWUE 
relative to their PCK and NADP-ME counterparts. Glacial 
[CO
2] decreased PWUE in all species by an average of 55% 
(Figs 1C, 2C; Table 3; Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online).
Leaf N use efficiency and plant dry mass
Under both [CO2] treatments, leaf [N]mass was highest in P . mil-
ioides (C 3–C4) and lowest in Heteropogon contortus (PCK). 
Glacial [CO2] enhanced leaf [N] mass in all grasses except for 
Panicum monticola and Chloris gayana (PCK). The largest 
enhancement was observed in the C
3 (51%) and NADP-ME 
(29%) species (Figs 1D, 2D; Table 3; Supplementary Table S1 
at JXB online).

At ambient [CO2], PNUE varied 3-fold amongst the species 
in a manner unrelated to their photosynthetic type. Glacial 
[CO2] reduced PNUE to a lesser extent in the C 4 (30%) rela-
tive to the C 3 (58%) and C 3–C4 (79%) species. At glacial 
[CO2], PNUE was highest in C 4 plants (PCK >NADP-ME 
and NAD-ME) and lowest in C3 and C3–C4 plants (Figs 1E, 
2E; Table 3; Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online).
At ambient [CO2], plant dry mass (PDM) was lower in the 
C3–C4 and NAD-ME species relative to the C 3 and other C 4 
species. At glacial [CO2], the C4 species accumulated more bio-
mass than their C3 and C3–C4 counterparts, which had similar 
PDM. Glacial [CO2] reduced PDM to a greater extent in the 
C3 (70%) and C 3–C4 (42%) species relative to the C 4 (25%) 
species. Amongst the C 4 species, PDM was least and most 
inhibited by glacial [CO 2] in the NAD-ME and NADP-ME 
grasses, respectively (Figs 1F , 2H; Table  3; Supplementary 
Table S1 at JXB online).
Rubisco and soluble protein content
Under both [CO 2] treatments, leaf Rubisco content was 
higher in Panicum milioides (C3–C4) relative to the other spe-
cies, and in the two NAD-ME species relative to the other C4 
grasses. At ambient [CO2], P . bisulcatum (C3) and NAD-ME 
grasses had similar Rubisco contents. Glacial [CO2] increased 
Rubisco content in P .  bisulcatum (2.3-fold) and in three 
(Astrebla lappacea, Panicum coloratum, and H. contortus; 1.2- 
to 1.7-fold) of the eight C4 species (Tables 3, 4).
The ratio of Rubisco to soluble proteins and the propor -
tion of leaf N invested in Rubisco (Rubisco-N) were higher in 
the C3 and C3–C4 species relative to the C4 species. Amongst 
the C4 species, the NADP-ME grasses tended to have the low-
est leaf N or soluble protein investment in Rubisco. Glacial 
[CO
2] increased Rubisco-N in the C3 species, reduced it in the 
C3–C4 species, and had little effect in the C 4 species (Tables 
3, 4).
The C3, C3–C4, and NAD-ME species had similar Rubisco 
activities, which were higher relative to the PCK and 
NADP-ME species. Glacial [CO
2] significantly up-regulated 
Rubisco activity in the C 3 and NAD-ME grasses only (Figs 
2F, 3A, Table 3; Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online).
Activity of C4 cycle enzymes in C4 grasses
At ambient [CO2], PEPC activity was highest in A. lappacea  
(NAD-ME) and C.  gayana (PCK), and lowest in P .  maxi-
mum (PCK). At glacial [CO
2], PEPC activity was highest in 
A. lappacea and lowest in P . monticola (PCK). Glacial [CO2] 
stimulated PEPC activity in five out of the eight C 4 species 
(Figs 2H, 3B; Table 3; Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online). 
Variations in the ratio of PEPC to Rubisco activity reflected 
changes in PEPC activity (Fig. 3H; Table 3; Supplementary 
Table S1).
In this study, only the activities of the decarboxylases 
NADP-ME and PEP-CK were measured. Significant activity 
of NADP-ME was measured in the two NADP-ME species, 
while marginal NADP-ME activity was detected in the two 
NAD-ME species and in one of the PCK species (Fig. 3C). 
In contrast, PEP-CK activity was ubiquitous among the C
4 
species used, with C.  gayana showing the highest PEP-CK

activity. Overall, growth [CO 2] had no significant effect on 
the activity of either decarboxylase (Fig.  3C–D , Table  3; 
Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online).
The detectability of the activity of both carboxylases and 
decarboxylases was corroborated by immunodetection of the 
corresponding protein (Fig.  6). PEPC activity and protein 
were lacking from the C
3 and C 3–C4 species and present in 
all C4 grasses. NADP-ME activity and protein were found in 
two C4 species only. PEP-CK activity was measured in all C4 
grasses, and the protein was readily detected in six grasses, 
with A. lappacea and H. contortus exhibiting weak immuno-
reaction with the available antibody, possibly due to divergent 
amino acid sequences of PEP-CK in these two species (Fig. 6).
In vivo estimates of maximal Rubisco (Vcmax) and PEPC 
activity (Vpmax) in C4 grasses
In vivo estimates of V cmax and V pmax were calculated using 
the C 4 photosynthesis model (von Caemmerer, 2000) from 
A–Ci curves measured at high light and 27 °C (Fig. 5). The 
variation of gas exchange-derived V cmax between the C 4 spe-
cies was unrelated to their biochemical subtype. In contrast 
to its effect on in vitro V
cmax (Rubisco activity), glacial [CO2] 
reduced gas exchange Vcmax in two out of the eight C4 species 
(Fig.  3E; Table  3; Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online). 
Consequently, in vivo and in vitro estimates of V cmax were 
unrelated among the C4 grasses (Fig. 6B). In contrast, PEPC 
activity was positively correlated with that of Rubisco across 
the C
4 species and [CO2] treatments (Fig. 6A).
On average, NAD-ME species tended to have higher 
Vpmax and V pmax/Vcmax relative to the other C 4 grasses, espe-
cially at glacial [CO2]. Glacial [CO2] increased Vpmax and the 
Vpmax/Vcmax ratio in all C4 species, except for C. gayana, by an 
average of 25% and 19%, respectively (Fig. 3F , G; Table 3; 
Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online). Within the C 4 spe-
cies, Vpmax showed significant positive correlations with in 
vitro PEPC and Rubisco activities (Fig. 6C, D).
Discussion
Photosynthetic efficiency under glacial CO2: C3, C3–C4, 
and C4 pathways
In accordance with theoretical understanding, the current 
study revealed that photosynthetic rates (A
sat) were most 
responsive to decreased [CO 2] from ambient to glacial levels 
in C3 followed by C3–C4 and then C4 species. In addition, the 
C4 grasses had higher photosynthesis under ambient and gla-
cial [CO2] relative to their C 3 and C 3–C4 counterparts (Figs 
1A, 2A). Similar responses were observed for other C3, C3–C4, 
and C4 species exposed to 180  μl CO2 l–1 and 380  μl CO2 l–1  
(Ward et  al., 1999; Cunniff et  al., 2010; Pinto et  al., 2011; 
Vogan and Sage, 2012).
Stomatal conductance was greater at glacial [CO 2] com-
pared with ambient [CO 2] in all species, but in particular 
was higher in C4 species relative to the C 3 and C3–C4 species 
(Figs 1B, 2B). Huxman and Monson (2003) found that gs was 
more sensitive to changing C i in C4 relative to C3 and C3–C4

Flaveria species. Recently, Vogan and Sage (2011) presented 
evidence of changed C i sensitivity for g s in Flaveria species 
during their evolutionary transition from C 3 to C 4 photo-
synthesis. In contrast, Morison and Gifford (1983) observed 
little difference in stomatal sensitivity to short-term changes 
of [CO
2] or vapour pressure deficit between two C 3 and two 
C4 grasses. Growth at low [CO 2] may cause acclimation of 
the stomatal response that is not necessarily captured during 
short-term gas exchange measurements. However, a number 
of studies found no evidence of differential stomatal acclima-
tion between C
3 and C 4 plants (Cunniff et al., 2010; Vogan 
and Sage, 2012). Hence, there does not seem to be a consen-
sus regarding the relative stomatal sensitivity to short- or 
long-term changes in [CO
2] between C3 and C4 plants, which 
remains an area worthy of further investigation.
Despite having larger gs at glacial [CO 2], C4 species main-
tained greater PWUE than C 3–C4 and C 3 species as a result 
of higher photosynthetic rates in C4 plants (Fig. 1). Improved

Photosynthesis of C3, C3–C4, and C4 grasses at glacial CO2 | 3677
PWUE is one of the most consistently reported advantages of 
C4 species (Long, 1999; Taylor et al., 2010). Higher PWUE in 
the C3–C4 species relative to the C3 species under both growth 
[CO2] confirmed that the photorespiratory pump of the inter-
mediate pathway confers greater water use efficiency relative 
to the C
3 pathway (Pinto et al., 2011; Vogan and Sage, 2011), 
thereby achieving PWUE similar to the C4, NADP-ME path-
way under glacial [CO2] (Fig. 1C).
Higher PNUE in C 4 relative to C 3 plants under ambient 
[CO2] is well established (Brown, 1978; Long, 1999; Taylor 
et al., 2010). In this study, these differences were maintained 
under glacial [CO
2] as a result of higher photosynthetic rates 
and lower leaf [N] in the C4 relative to the C3 and C3–C4 spe-
cies (Fig.  1). The C 3–C4 species had no PNUE advantage 
over the C 3 species, mainly due to the higher leaf [N] and 
Rubisco-N of the intermediate species (Table 4). In contrast, 
intermediate Flaveria species maintained higher photosyn-
thesis and PNUE relative to C
3 congeners at ambient and 
glacial [CO2] (Vogan and Sage, 2012).
Growth of P .  bisulcatum (C 3) at glacial [CO 2] increased 
Rubisco activity and gs to improve photosynthetic capacity and 
CO2 supply, respectively (Tissue et al., 1995; Gesch et al., 2000; 
Anderson et  al., 2001). These commonly reported responses 
represent significant N and water costs for C3 plants at glacial 
[CO2], thus reducing their PWUE and PNUE. The additional 
resource requirements at low [CO2] may have contributed to 
the more pronounced reduction in plant biomass in C 3 rela-
tive to C4 plants observed in this study (Fig. 2F) as in others 
(Ward et  al., 1999; Cunniff et  al., 2010; Ripley et  al., 2013). 
Consequently, low WUE and NUE of C3 photosynthesis at low 
[CO2] may have favoured the evolution of C4 phototosynthesis.
Photosynthetic efficiency under glacial CO2: the C4 
subtypes
Results obtained in this study at glacial [CO 2] largely con-
firmed previously reported differences in photosynthetic 
efficiency among the C 4 subtypes at ambient [CO 2], and 
revealed a number of insights into the physiology of C 4 sub-
types, as discussed below.
First, there were no subtype differences in photosynthetic 
rates or their sensitivity to decreased growth [CO 2]. These 
results constitute new evidence that there are no discernible 
differences in the efficiency of the CCM operating in the 
three C
4 subtypes, despite their diverse leaf biochemistry 
and anatomy. This conclusion is supported by the findings 
that CO
2 leakiness out of the bundle sheath (a surrogate 
measure of CCM efficiency) is similar among C 4 grasses 
with different subtypes (Henderson et  al., 1992; Cousins 
et al., 2008).
Secondly, NAD-ME species had lower g s and higher 
PWUE relative to NADP-ME and PCK counterparts at 
glacial [CO
2]. Moreover, gs was less affected by glacial [CO 2] 
in NAD-ME than in NADP-ME and PCK grasses (Fig. 2). 
Previous studies demonstrated that photosynthetic activity 
was less sensitive to water deficit, and leaf traits were bet-
ter suited for arid habitats in an NAD-ME relative to an 
NADP-ME and a PCK grass (Carmo-Silva et  al., 2007, 
2009). In another study, Ghannoum et  al. (2002) showed 
that NAD-ME grasses increased their whole-plant WUE to 
a greater extent than their NADP-ME counterparts under 
water stress. Taken together, these findings are consistent 
with the observation that grasses with the NAD-ME subtype 
predominate in more arid regions relative to the other two C
4 
subtypes (Hattersley, 1992; Taub, 2000).
Thirdly, NADP-ME grasses showed the greatest increase 
of leaf [N]mass, which may be linked to their stomatal response 
in that the correlation between N uptake (proxy leaf [N]) and 
mass flow of soil water through the transpiration stream 
(proxy g
s) is commonly reported in plants grown under dif-
ferent atmospheric [CO 2] (Conroy and Hocking, 1993; 
McDonald et al., 2002; Sherwin et al., 2013).
Fourthly, NAD-ME grasses showed the lowest biomass 
reduction in response to decreased growth [CO 2] relative

NADP-ME (C), and PEP-CK (D) extracted from leaves of selected grass species grown at glacial (180 μl l–1, G) or ambient (400 μl l–1, A) [CO2].

to the PCK and NADP-ME species. NAD-ME grasses 
also had lower plant biomass relative to the other C 4 spe-
cies at both growth [CO 2]. Studies conducted at elevated 
[CO2] have shown that growth response to high [CO 2] 
decreases with decreasing growth potential (Poorter, 
1993; Ziska and Bunce, 1997). Extrapolating these find-
ings to low [CO
2] suggests that the lower growth response 
to glacial [CO 2] in NAD-ME plants may be related to 
their smaller biomass accumulation relative to the other, 
larger C
4 species.
Photosynthetic enzymes under glacial CO2
Generally, growth at low [CO 2] leads to increased photo-
synthetic capacity, g s, and leaf [N] in C 3 plants (Dippery 
et  al., 1995; Ward et  al., 1999; Anderson et  al., 2001; 
Cunniff et al., 2010; Gerhart and Ward, 2010; Ripley et al., 
2013). Accordingly, P . bisulcatum (C 3) exhibited increased 
leaf proteins, including Rubisco at glacial [CO 2] (Fig.  2; 
Table  4). Panicum milioides (C 3–C4) did not up-regulate 
Rubisco content at glacial [CO 2], possibly due to the high 
leaf [N] and Rubisco-N in this species; a consequence of 
the high N costs of operating two Calvin cycles in the mes-
ophyll and bundle sheath cells (Monson, 1989; Monson 
and Rawsthorne, 2000).
The operation of Rubisco under elevated [CO
2] in the 
bundle sheath, the multiplicity of metabolic cycles and cells 
involved in C
4 photosynthesis, and the complexity of its reg-
ulation thwart the task of predicting how C 4 photosynthe-
sis will acclimate to growth at low [CO 2]. Measurements of 
photosynthetic rates under growth [CO2] (Asat) indicated that 
photosynthesis in the C 4 grasses was CO 2 limited at glacial 
[CO2], albeit to a lesser extent than C 3 and C 3–C4 counter-
parts (Fig. 2A). This may explain the significant up-regula-
tion of the two carboxylases, Rubisco and PEPC, which was 
observed in a number of the C
4 grasses (Figs 3–6). Generally, 
the activities of Rubisco and PEPC changed in concert, a 
reflection of the fine balance operating between these two 
enzymes which modulate the pace of the C
3 and C 4 cycles 
during C4 photosynthesis, respectively (von Caemmerer and 
Furbank, 2003). There is strong evidence showing that CO 2 
delivery into the bundle sheath and fixation in the meso-
phyll are tightly regulated, as indicated by the constancy of 
leakiness (a measure of CO
2 fixed by PEPC but not Rubisco, 
subsequently leaking back from the bundle sheath) under a 
wide range of environmental conditions (Henderson et  al., 
1992; Cousins et al., 2008). Nevertheless, the PEPC/Rubisco 
ratio increased at glacial [CO
2] in two C 4 species (Fig. 3H). 
Increasing PEPC/Rubisco via transgenic transformation in 
Flaveria bidentis led to increased leakiness, an indication of 
reduced efficiency of the C
4 mechanism (von Caemmerer 
et  al., 1997b). In the current study, V pmax and PEPC activ-
ity were linearly correlated, while Vcmax and Rubisco activity 
showed no correlation (Fig.  5). Reconciling the in vivo and 
in vitro estimates of Rubisco and PEPC activity will require 
greater knowledge about bundle sheath cell wall conductance 
and [CO
2] than is currently available (von Caemmerer et al., 
1997a; von Caemmerer and Furbank, 2003).
The activities of the two measured decarboxylases were not 
affected by growth [CO2], possibly reflecting the low control 
that decarboxylases exert on the photosynthetic flux. Pengelly 
et al. (2012) reported that NADP-ME activity in transgenic 
F.  bidentis can be halved without affecting photosynthetic 
rates or growth. Accordingly, the rate of the decarboxylases 
measured at ambient [CO
2] may be sufficient under glacial 
[CO2], where Rubisco and PEPC activities were up-regulated 
in a number of C 4 species. Although PEPC and NADP-ME 
have significant effects on the efficiency of the C 4 pathway 
as evidenced by changes in leakiness, Rubisco retains a high

control of metabolic flux in C 4 leaves (Furbank et al., 1997; 
von Caemmerer et al., 1997b; Pengelly et al., 2012).
It is worth noting that PEP-CK activity and, to a lesser 
extent, PEP-CK protein were ubiquitously detected in the 
C4 species used in this study. Significant PEP-CK activ-
ity in C 4 grasses and eudicots of the NADP-ME and 
NAD-ME subtypes has been previously reported (Walker 
et al., 1997; Wingler et al., 1999; Carmo-Silva et al., 2008; 
Muhaidat and McKown, 2013). These findings challenge 
the classical view of the C
4 subtypes, where a single decar -
boxylase dominates (Hatch, 1987; Furbank, 2011). Recent 
studies have postulated a role for PEP-CK as a second 
decarboxylase in maize that serves to match ATP and 
NADPH demand in bundle sheath and mesophyll cells 
under different light environments (Bellasio and Griffiths, 
2013). The full physiological significance of PEP-CK in 
a wider range of C
4 grasses and environments is yet to be 
elucidated.
Conclusions
Various photosynthetic responses, including increased 
leaf Rubisco, nitrogen, and g
s, were observed in response 
to growth at glacial [CO 2]. Nevertheless, the operation of 
a CCM ensured that PWUE and PNUE remained higher 
in C
4 species relative to C 3 and C 3–C4 species, while the 
photorespiration pump ensured higher PWUE in the C 3–
C4 relative to the C 3 species. Greater resource use efficiency 
promotes cheaper biomass construction costs, and hence 
reduces productivity losses at low [CO
2]. Accordingly, high 
resource use efficiency may have constituted a key evolu-
tionary advantage for the transition from C
3 to C 4 photo-
synthesis under low [CO 2] (Cerling et al., 1998; Sage, 2004). 
Results obtained in this study support the notion that 
Rubisco and PEPC, rather than the decarboxylases, modu-
late the response to glacial [CO
2] for C4 grasses with differ -
ent biochemical subtypes.
