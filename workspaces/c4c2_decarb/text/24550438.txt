Abstract
In family Cleomaceae there are NAD-malic enzyme-type C 4 species having different forms of leaf anatomy. Leaves 
of Cleome angustifolia have Glossocardioid-type anatomy with a single complex Kranz unit which surrounds all the 
veins, while C.  gynandra has Atriplicoid anatomy with multiple Kranz units, each surrounding an individual vein. 
Biochemical and ultrastructural differentiation of mesophyll (M) and bundle sheath (BS) cells were studied along a 
developmental gradient, from the leaf base (youngest) to the tip (mature). Initially, there is cell-specific expression 
of certain photosynthetic enzymes, which subsequently increase along with structural differentiation. At the base of 
the leaf, following division of ground tissue to form M and BS cells which are structurally similar, there is selective 
localization of Rubisco and glycine decarboxylase to BS cells. Thus, a biochemical C
3 default stage, with Rubisco 
expression in both cell types, does not occur. Additionally, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) is selectively 
expressed in M cells near the base. Surprisingly, in both species, an additional layer of spongy M cells on the abaxial 
side of the leaf has the same differentiation with PEPC, even though it is not in contact with BS cells. During devel-
opment along the longitudinal gradient there is structural differentiation of the cells, chloroplasts, and mitochondria, 
resulting in complete formation of Kranz anatomy. In both species, development of the C
4 system occurs similarly, 
irrespective of having very different types of Kranz anatomy, different ontogenetic origins of BS and M, and independ-
ent evolutionary origins of C
4 photosynthesis.
Key words: C 4 anatomy, C4 development, Cleome angustifolia, Cleome gynandra, C4 photosynthesis, C4 plants, 
immunolocalization, ultrastructure.
Introduction
In most C 4 plants, the dual-cell system (so-called Kranz 
anatomy) operates to concentrate CO 2 around ribulose 
1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase (Rubisco). Primary 
fixation of CO 2 into C 4 acids occurs in the outer layer of 
mesophyll (M) cells using phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 
(PEPC), while decarboxylation of C
4 acids and refixation 
of CO 2 by Rubisco in the C 3 pathway occur in the inner 
layer of bundle sheath (BS) cells (Hatch, 1987). This CO 2-
concentrating mechanism restricts the competing ribulose 
bisphosphate (RuBP) oxygenase reaction and synthesis of 
glycolate, and the loss of CO
2 by photorespiration. Glycine 
decarboxylase (GDC), which is essential for photorespiratory

CO2 release in the glycolate pathway, is confined exclusively 
to BS mitochondria (Edwards and Walker, 1983; Edwards 
and Voznesenskaya, 2011; Sage et al., 2012).
C4 species are classified according to their biochemical 
subtype based on the predominant type of C4 decarboxylase, 
NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME), NAD-malic enzyme 
(NAD-ME), or phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, used to 
release and concentrate CO
2 around Rubisco (Hatch, 1987). 
The two main types of C 4 cycles in eudicots function either 
through NADP-ME, which is located in the chloroplasts, or 
through NAD-ME, which is located in the mitochondria of 
BS cells. There are structural differences in grana develop-
ment between M and BS chloroplasts in NADP-ME- ver -
sus NAD-ME-type C
4 species associated with differences in 
photochemistry. For C4 to function, NADPH is required to 
reduce 3-phosphoglycerate, the product of CO 2 fixation by 
Rubisco, to triose-phosphates. In NADP-ME-type C4 species, 
the primary shuttle of malate from M cells to BS chloroplasts 
provides both CO
2 and NADPH, which reduces the require-
ment for photosystem II (PSII) activity, and the associated 
development of grana, in BS chloroplasts. In NAD-ME-
type species, BS chloroplasts have increased grana develop-
ment and PSII activity, since the primary shuttle of aspartate 
from the M to BS cells delivers CO
2, but not reductive power 
(Edwards and Walker, 1983; Edwards and Voznesenskaya, 
2011).
C4 photosynthesis is considered to have evolved inde-
pendently >60 times (Sage et  al., 2011), resulting in much 
structural diversity in the forms of C 4 which evolved from 
C3 ancestors (Dengler and Nelson, 1999; Peter and Katinas, 
2003; Muhaidat et  al., 2007; Edwards and Voznesenskaya, 
2011). Among the forms identified, 16 develop Kranz around 
individual veins, while eight develop a compound Kranz 
unit near the periphery of the leaf, which surrounds all 
veins (Edwards and Voznesenskaya, 2011). The diversity in 
forms occurs by special positioning of the M and BS layers 
in relation to the distribution of veins and other tissues, by 
the occurrence of different types of tissues in the leaf (e.g. 
mestome sheath in monocots, hypodermal, or water storage 
cells in dicots), by the way organelles (chloroplast and mito-
chondria) are arranged in BS cells and their differentiation 
between M and BS cells, and by structural diversity in devel-
oping gas diffusion barriers to support the CO
2-concentrating 
mechanism (Edwards and Voznesenskaya, 2011).
The ontogeny of the complex C 4 system requires a highly 
coordinated selective expression of many genes during devel-
opment, concurrent with establishment of Kranz anatomy. 
Genes controlling development of M and BS specialization 
for function of the C
4 system, and the degree of redundancy 
which has occurred during the multiple times C4 has evolved 
is unknown. Among monocot and eudicot C 4 species which 
are being used as genetic models, concerted efforts are needed 
to identify regulatory factors along leaf developmental 
gradients which control the expression of specific C
4 traits 
(Covshoff et al., 2013).
There have been a number of studies on structural and 
biochemical development of forms of C 4 having Kranz 
anatomy around individual veins. This includes extensive 
analysis of leaf development in Zea mays which has classi-
cal NADP-ME-type anatomy (Sheen and Bogorad, 1985; 
Langdale et  al., 1988b; Dengler and Nelson, 1999; Sheen, 
1999). In the interest of identifying transcription factors con-
trolling expression of specific traits which are required for 
C
4 function, there have been recent studies on the develop-
mental gradient along the leaf of maize, including analyses 
of transcriptome, proteome, and structural changes (see Li 
et al., 2010; Majeran et al., 2010; Covshoff et al., 2013; Wang 
et al., 2013). Developmental studies have also been conducted 
on some other forms of Kranz anatomy in grasses (Dengler 
et al., 1985, 1986, 1996; Wakayama et al., 2003) and on dif-
ferent structural forms of Kranz in family Cyperaceae (Soros 
and Dengler, 2001). Among eudicots, significant developmen-
tal studies have been conducted on two NAD-ME-type spe-
cies having Atriplicoid-type anatomy, namely Atriplex rosea 
(Liu and Dengler, 1994; Dengler et  al., 1995; Dengler and 
Nelson, 1999) and Amaranthus hypochondriacus (Ramsperger 
et al., 1996; Patel and Berry, 2008). There has been less atten-
tion to development of types of Kranz anatomy which sur -
round all veins in the leaves. There are reports on NADP-ME 
Salsoloid type with Salsola richteri (Voznesenskaya et  al., 
2003b), NAD-ME Salsinoid type with Suaeda taxifolia, and 
NAD-ME Schoberioid type with Suaeda eltonica (Koteyeva 
et al., 2011a).
These studies on different forms of C
4 show a progression 
in structural and biochemical differentiation during devel-
opment, with dimorphic M and BS cells originating from 
monomorphic cells. Characterization of the development of 
Kranz anatomy includes identification of the origins of M 
and BS cells during leaf initiation, which is different depend-
ing on Kranz anatomical type or plant lineages (Dengler 
et al., 1985; Dengler and Nelson, 1999; Soros and Dengler, 
2001; Koteyeva et al., 2011a). This characterization includes 
structural differentiation of M and BS chloroplasts and 
their function in photochemistry to provide energy coop-
eratively for CO
2 assimilation (Brown, 1975; Dengler et al., 
1985; Langdale et al., 1988a, b; Dengler and Nelson, 1999; 
Sheen, 1999; von Caemmerer and Furbank, 2003; Patel and 
Berry, 2008; Li et  al., 2010; Majeran et  al., 2010; Edwards 
and Voznesenskaya, 2011; Koteyeva et  al., 2011a; Wang 
et  al., 2013). It also consists of analysis of the differences 
among forms of C
4 in the development of barriers to diffu-
sion of CO 2 from sites of decarboxylation in BS cells, which 
enables CO2 to be concentrated around Rubisco (e.g. BS cell 
wall thickness, location of the C 4 acid decarboxylase, and 
the position of organelles) (von Caemmerer and Furbank, 
2003). Determining when selective expression of enzymes 
in M and BS cells for C
4 function occurs during develop-
ment among different forms of C4 is also important (Dengler 
et al., 1985; Soros and Dengler, 2001; Koteyeva et al., 2011a; 
Langdale, 2012). Analyses show that there are differences in 
the sequence and the timing of biochemical and structural 
changes, with respect to establishment of the vascular sys-
tem, and whether expression of traits is regulated by environ-
mental (light) or developmental cues (Langdale et al., 1988a; 
Wang et  al., 1992; Dengler et  al., 1995; Ramsperger et  al., 
1996; Dengler and Nelson, 1999; Sheen, 1999; Voznesenskaya

et al., 2003a; Wakayama et al., 2003; Koteyeva et al., 2011a; 
Langdale, 2012).
There is recent interest in the occurrence of C 4 photosyn-
thesis in Cleomaceae, one of 19 families in which C 4 species 
have been found (Sage et al., 2011). The genus Cleome sensu 
lato consists of >200 species. Most species have the C 3 type 
of photosynthesis; but, it has been shown that three spe-
cies, Cleome angustifolia, C. gynandra, and C. oxalidea, have 
NAD-ME-type C4 photosynthesis in leaves and cotyledons 
(Marshall et al., 2007; Voznesenskaya et al., 2007; Feodorova 
et al., 2010; Koteyeva et al., 2011b). Two of them, C. gynan-
dra and C. oxalidea, have flat leaves with an Atriplicoid type 
of anatomy consisting of multiple Kranz units around indi-
vidual veins, while C. angustifolia with Glossocardioid-type 
anatomy, has a single compound Kranz unit with a dou-
ble layer of concentric chlorenchyma surrounding all the 
veins and water storage cells (Koteyeva et al., 2011b). They 
belong to separate lineages in the genus and they have differ-
ent distribution, pantropical for C. gynandra, Australian for 
C. oxalidea, and African for C. angustifolia (Feodorova et al., 
2010). Cleome gynandra was originally proposed as a model 
NAD-ME eudicot C
4 species for identifying factors control-
ling development and function of C 4 photosynthesis (Brown 
et al., 2005). The attractive features of this species are that it 
can be transformed, grown under a short life cycle, has C
3 and 
C3–C4 intermediate Cleome relatives for comparative stud-
ies, and, phylogenetically, among C 4 genera it has the clos-
est position to the well-established model species Arabidopsis 
thaliana (a C
3 dicot) (Feodorova et al., 2010; Covshoff et al., 
2013). Progress towards development of C.  gynandra has 
been made, including identifying transcripts associated with 
C
4 biochemistry and metabolite transporters (Kajala et  al., 
2012), in comparative RNaseq profiling (Bräutigam et  al., 
2011), and in the ability to transform it (Newell et al., 2010).
The purpose of the current study was to examine devel-
opment of C 4 in two NAD-ME-type C 4 Cleome species, 
C. gynandra and C. angustifolia, which have major differences 
in leaf morphology, vascular pattern, and forms of Kranz 
anatomy. This included analysis of M and BS cell formation 
from leaf primordia, and structural and biochemical transi-
tions during leaf ontogeny, to determine whether there is con-
vergence in development and expression of C
4 traits.
Materials and methods
Plant material
Seeds of Cleome angustifolia Forssk. (from herbarium material 
kindly provided by Drs A. Oskolskii and O. Maurin) and C. gynan-
dra L.  (kindly provided by Dr A.S. Raghavendra) were stored at 
3–5  ºC prior to use and were germinated on moist paper in Petri 
dishes at room temperature and a photosynthetic photon flux den-
sity ~20 μmol quanta m
–2 s–1. The seedlings were then transplanted 
to 15 cm diameter pots with commercial potting soil and grown 
in the greenhouse during the mid-winter/spring months, with an 
approximate 26  ºC day/18  ºC night temperatures. Maximum mid-
day photosynthetic photon flux density was 500  μmol quanta m
–2 
s–1 on clear days. Plants were fertilized once a week with Peter’s 
Professional (20:20:20; Scotts Miracle-Gro Co., Marysville, OH, 
USA). For microscopy and biochemical analyses, leaves of different 
lengths were taken from plants of ~3–6 weeks old. Voucher speci-
mens are available at the Marion Ownbey Herbarium, Washington 
State University under # WS 375818 for C.  angustifolia and WS 
369765 for C. gynandra.
Light and electron microscopy
Study of the structural basis of leaf development was carried out 
on expanding leaves with lengths of leaflets from 0.5 mm to 7 mm. 
Vegetative shoot tips were used to study the earliest events of leaf 
initiation and development. Three samples of each leaflet length 
(using the terminal leaflet in the palmate leaf) were harvested from 
three independent plants of each species (a total of nine samples 
from each species for each leaf length). Vegetative shoot apices with 
several of the youngest leaf primordia, and leaves of intermediate 
size (6–7 mm in length), were sectioned longitudinally. Additionally, 
cross-sections were made in 0.5 mm steps from the tip to base of 
3–5 mm long leaves.
Sample preparation for light microscopy (LM) and trans-
mission electron microscopy (TEM) was carried out following 
Koteyeva et  al. (2011a ). An Olympus BH-2 (Olympus Optical 
Co. Ltd) light microscope equipped with an LM Digital Camera 
and Software (Jenoptik ProgRes Camera, C12plus, Jena, 
Germany) was used for observation and collection of images at 
the LM level. A Hitachi H-600 (Hitachi Scientific Instruments, 
Tokyo, Japan) and FEI Tecnai G2 (Field Emission Instruments 
Company, Hillsboro, OR, USA) equipped with Eagle FP 5271/82 
4K HR200KV digital camera transmission electron microscopes 
were used for TEM studies.
The cell size, length of the chloroplasts, and the thickness of 
cell walls were measured for the adaxial M and BS on micrographs 
from leaf longitudinal and cross-sections at different distances 
from the leaf base using an image analysis program (UTHSCSA, 
Image Tool for Windows, version 3.00). For both types of cells, 
the measurements of cell wall thickness were made on cell walls 
facing intercellular airspaces between M and BS. From images of 
the cell walls, plasmodesmata between M and BS cells (which were 
radially but not longitudinally oriented in the wall sections) were 
counted. The plasmodesmata frequency was referred to as the 
number of plasmodesmata per 1  μm of cell–cell contact interface 
length.
Images of the shoot apices with the youngest leaf primordia and 
surface of young leaves for analysis of stomata were captured under 
the low vacuum mode with an FEI Scanning Electron Microscope 
Quanta 200F (Feild Emission Instruments Company) without addi-
tional treatments.
To observe the leaf vascular pattern, leaves of different ages, 
from youngest primordia to fully expanded leaves, were cleared in 
70% ethanol (v/v) until chlorophyll was removed, bleached with 
5% (w/v) NaOH overnight, and then rinsed three times in water. 
At least five leaves of different ages were studied from two to three 
different plants. The leaves were mounted in water on slides and 
examined under a UV light [with a 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole 
(DAPI) filter] on a Fluorescence Microscope Leica DMFSA (Leica 
Microsystems Wetzlar GmbH, Germany) using autofluorescence of 
lignified tracheary elements of the xylem.
In situ immunolocalization
Sample preparation and immunolocalization by LM and TEM 
were carried out on longitudinal sections of leaves, 6–7 mm long, 
following the procedure in Koteyeva et  al. (2011a). Antibodies 
used were anti-spinach Rubisco [large subunit (LSU)] IgG (cour -
tesy of B. McFadden) commercially available anti-maize PEPC IgG 
(Chemicon, Temecula, CA, USA), and the P-subunit of GDC, all 
raised in rabbits. The density of labelling was determined by count-
ing the gold particles on digital electron micrographs using the 
UTHSCSA image analysis program and calculating the number per 
unit area (μm
2). Standard errors were determined.

Western blot analysis
For the study of accumulation of the main photosynthetic 
enzymes during development, individual leaflets of different ages, 
with lengths of 1–3, 3–6, 6–10, 10–15 mm, and 30–35 mm (totally 
expanded mature leaflet), were used. Soluble proteins were extracted 
from leaves and prepared for SDS–PAGE following Koteyeva et al. 
(2011b). Protein concentration was determined with an RCDC pro-
tein quantification kit (Bio-Rad), which tolerates detergents and 
reducing agents. A 10 μg aliquot of soluble protein was applied per 
lane, with separation by 12% (w/v) SDS–PAGE, and transferred to 
a nitrocellulose membrane for analysis of the several photosynthetic 
enzymes and GDC. Primary antibodies used were anti-Amaranthus 
hypochondriacus NAD-ME IgG against the 65 kDa α-subunit (Long 
and Berry, 1996) (dilution 1:5000), anti-Zea mays PEPC IgG (1:100 
000), anti-Zea mays pyruvate,Pi dikinase (PPDK) IgG (courtesy of 
T. Sugiyama) (1:5000), anti-Pisum sativum L. GDC P-subunit (cour-
tesy of Dr D. Oliver) (1:10 000), and anti-Spinacia oleracea Rubisco 
LSU IgG (courtesy of B. McFadden) (1:10 000). Goat anti-rabbit 
IgG–alkaline phosphatase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma) 
were used at a dilution of 1:10 000 for detection. Bound antibodies 
were visualized by developing the blots with 20 mM nitroblue tetra-
zolium and 75 mM 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate in detec-
tion buffer (100 mM TRIS-HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl, and 5 mM 
MgCl
2). Two separate blots from two separate extractions were 
made for each enzyme. The intensities of bands in western blots 
were quantified with an image analysis program (ImageJ 1.37, NIH, 
USA) and expressed relative to the level in the fully expanded leaves.
Mass spectrometric measurements of Γ, R
d, and leaf carbon 
isotope composition
A membrane inlet mass spectrometer (DELTA V Plus; Thermo 
Scientific) connected to a closed leaf chamber via a membrane inlet 
was used to measure rates of CO
2 exchange and the CO2 compensa-
tion point (Γ) in C. gynandra young and mature leaves, as described 
previously (Maxwell et al., 1998; Ruuska et al., 2000). Cuttings from 
mature leaves ~1.5 cm2 or 5–7 young (~7 mm) leaves of C.  gynan-
dra harvested from several branches were placed in the chamber 
and, once CO 2 and O 2 concentrations were balanced with ambient 
concentrations, the leaf chamber was sealed and after 5 min sitting 
in the dark was submitted to an irradiance of 1000  μmol m–2 s–1. 
The temperature was controlled at 25 °C using a water bath circu-
lating around the chamber. Net CO
2 assimilation was followed in 
the sealed chamber by measuring the changes in 12CO2 concentra-
tion over time until reaching Γ; that is, when the amount of CO 2 
assimilated by photosynthesis was balanced with the amount of 
CO
2 released by respiration and photorespiration. The rate of dark 
respiration (Rd) was calculated from the rate of CO 2 released after 
a minimum of 5 min in the dark. The system was zeroed before and 
after each measurement by flushing the chamber with a mixture of 
nitrogen and oxygen.
Leaf carbon isotope composition was determined in C.  gynan-
dra from sections taken at the base, middle, and tip of young 0.7 cm 
leaves, and from mature leaves (n=3–6). As previously described 
(Voznesenskaya et  al., 2013), samples (1–2 mg) were placed in a 
tin capsule and combusted in a Eurovector elemental analyser; the 
resulting N
2 and CO2 gases were separated by gas chromatography 
and admitted into the inlet of a Micromass, Isoprime isotope ratio 
mass spectrometer (IRMS) for determination of 
13C/12C ratios (R). 
δ13C values were determined where 1000×R sample/Rstandard)–1, using 
PDB (Pee Dee Belemnite) as the standard.
Statistical analysis
Where indicated, standard errors were determined, and analysis 
of variance (ANOV A) was performed with Statistica 7.0 software 
(StatSoft, Inc.). Tukey’s HSD (honest significant difference) tests 
were used to analyse differences in cell and chloroplast sizes, cell 
wall thickness, plasmodesmata frequency, amounts of gold parti-
cles, intensities of bands in western blots, and Г and R
d values at 
different stages of leaf development. All analyses were performed at 
the 95% significance level.
Results
Early events in primary leaf morphogenesis
Cleome angustifolia and C. gynandra have palmate compound 
leaves with up to five flat, broad leaflets in C. gynandra and 
5–8 narrow leaflets in C.  angustifolia. Figure  1 shows the 
morphology and anatomy of a vegetative shoot apical meris-
tem of C. angustifolia and C. gynandra at the stage of active 
organogenesis, together with the early stages of morpho-
genesis of compound leaves (Fig. 1A–D). Leaf primordia in 
both species are initiated alternately. When the primordium 
reaches ~100 μm, the proliferation of marginal and submar -
ginal initials appears at the distal adaxial flank (Fig.  1B), 
giving rise to the terminal followed by the lateral primordial 
leaflets (Fig. 1A, C). Leaflets of C. angustifolia grow by meris-
tem initials at the base generating files of cells with restricted 
marginal growth resulting in narrow leaflets. Laminar growth 
in the leaflets of C. gynandra is initiated when they reach 0.4–
0.5 mm long, forming a flat blade (Fig. 1D).
In both species, the processes of tissue differentiation in 
terminal and lateral leaflets are similar; but they differ in 
growth dynamics, resulting in different sizes (Fig.  1A, C). 
Procambial strands of the future major veins are initiated 
acropetally (developing from the base towards the tip) in leaf-
lets. From analysis of cleared young leaves of different ages, 
the visualization of lignified elements of xylem confirms an 
acropetal pattern of differentiation of major veins, and shows 
a basipetal pattern of peripheral/minor vasculature develop-
ment. In C. angustifolia, the lateral veins develop from the tip 
(Fig. 1E). In general, C. gynandra also has a basipetal pattern 
of secondary vascular system development from the tip of 
the leaf and the leaf margins to the base; however, veins of 
different orders have different time courses of initiation, with 
later development of the higher order veins (not shown).
Leaflet development in compound leaves does not dif-
fer from that in simple leaves, as shown earlier for different 
species (Esau, 1965). The leaflet of Cleome species will be 
referred to later as ‘leaf’ for simplicity in presentation.
Ontogenetic origin of mesophyll and bundle 
sheath cells
The origin of M and BS cells was observed in cross- and lon-
gitudinal sections at the base of young leaves (leaf length of 
0.5–5 mm for C.  angustifolia and 3–7 mm for C.  gynandra). 
In C. angustifolia, M and BS cell precursors originate during 
the initiation of leaf primordium from the ground meristem, 
with subsequent division of abaxial M progenitors which give 
rise to the M layer adjacent to BS cells and an additional layer 
of abaxial chlorenchyma [precursors of the spongy meso-
phyll (SM) cell layer]. The middle layers of ground meristem 
generate water storage tissue and procambial strands. Y oung 
C4 leaf development in Cleome | 3529
leaf primordia (up to 0.5 mm) consist of 6–7 layers of ground 
meristem and the forming central procambial strand (exclud-
ing epidermis, Fig.  1F). During the subsequent leaf blade 
development, the M and BS cells divide only anticlinally, and 
the developing leaf consists of 7–8 cell layers between epi-
dermises depending on the number of progenitors of water 
storage cells (Fig. 1H).
In C. gynandra, the youngest leaves (up to 3 mm long) and 
the base of young leaves (7 mm long) consist of four layers of 
ground meristem between the adaxial and abaxial epidermis 
(not shown), with the abaxial subepidermal cells undergoing 
periclinal divisions very early in development and forming an 
additional abaxial layer which will later become SM (Fig. 1K, 
L). Periclinal division of the ground meristem cells in the sec-
ond layer leads to initiation of the procambial strand from the 
abaxial derivative (Fig. 1K, arrows show the different stages 
of procambial strand formation). The adaxial derivative is the 
progenitor of the upper BS cell (or 2–4 upper BS cells in the 
case of subsequent anticlinal divisions; Fig. 1K, arrowheads 
show the upper BS progenitors). All other BS cells originate 
from the second and third layers of ground meristem which 
surround the forming vascular tissues (Fig.  1L). The M is

differentiated from the first, second, third, or fourth layer of 
the ground meristem cells depending on the position of M 
cells around the ring (on the cross-section) of BS cells.
Development of Kranz anatomy
The formation of Kranz anatomy was studied at the LM and 
TEM levels using longitudinal sections of intermediate size 
young leaves. Clear gradual progression in distinct develop-
mental events can be observed along the leaf from the base 
to the tip. In both species, the meristematic activity is evident 
near the base of the leaf, followed by BS cell expansion with 
M cell intensive divisions, resulting in 2–3 M cells per BS cell 
as viewed on the leaf section. In both species the additional 
abaxial layer of SM cells has not undergone anticlinal divi-
sions, in contrast to their sister abaxial M (M
ab) cells which 
are adjacent to the BS (Fig.  1H, L). After transition of M 
cells to expansion, the structural differentiation of M and BS 
cells begins, and close to the leaf tip complete Kranz anat-
omy is established. Following the initial formation of M and 
BS cells from progenitor cells, four stages of chlorenchyma 
development were characterized in the progression towards 
the formation of the Kranz syndrome.
Stages of chlorenchyma development in C. angustifolia
Development was visualized using files of cells which were 
continuous from the base to the tip of the 6 mm long leaf. 
In Stage 1 at the meristematic zone of the base of the leaf 
(0–1 mm from the base), M and BS cells are similar in shape, 
size, and structure (Fig. 1G; Table 1). They can be identified 
by their position, from the adaxial side of the leaf subepider-
mal layer for M, and BS for the next layer, with an additional 
subepidermal layer of SM cells on the abaxial side. At this 
time M and BS cells undergo anticlinal divisions.
Following the completion of division of M cells, the expan-
sion of M and BS cells is evident (~2–3 mm from the base) 
(Table  1), and this was designated as Stage 2.  At this time 
M and BS cells have a central vacuole, and chloroplasts are 
distributed around the cell periphery. In M cells, the nucleus 
often has a central position (Fig.  2A). Chloroplasts have a 
relatively well-developed thylakoid system with numerous 
small grana which are structurally similar in both M and BS 
cells (Fig.  2D, E). Mitochondria in the chlorenchyma cells 
are few in number, small, and they have crescent-like cristae 
(Fig.  2J). The cells of all tissues are tightly packed; minor 
intercellular air spaces (IAS) exist between M and epidermal 
cells (Fig. 2A). Xylem and phloem elements are not differen-
tiated in veins.
Stage 3 (~3–5.5 mm from the base) of chlorenchyma devel-
opment is characterized by structural differentiation of M 
and BS. M cells have developed a palisade shape with a well-
developed central vacuole and organelles distributed around 
the cell periphery (Figs 1I, 2B). The characteristic centripetal 
positioning of organelles in BS cells is established (Fig.  1I, 
Fig. 2B). BS and M chloroplasts are structurally similar; but, 
compared with Stage 2, they have become enlarged (Table 1) 
and have a more developed thylakoid system (Fig. 2F, G). BS 
mitochondria are co-localized with chloroplasts, and they 
are also slightly enlarged (Fig.  2K). Intercellular air spaces 
throughout the M cell layer are more prominent (Figs 1I, 2B). 
The numbers of plasmodesmata connecting M and BS cells 
have increased (Fig. 2M; Table 1). At this stage, there are the 
first signs of vascular tissue differentiation in the minor veins. 
In most vascular bundles, 1–2 tracheary elements are well 
developed, while the sieve elements of the phloem are still not 
completely differentiated as they contain a cytoplasmic layer 
with organelles delimited by the tonoplast. Mature xylem ves-
sels can be identified by the prominent secondary wall thick-
ening and the lack of cytoplasm. Mature sieve tubes contain 
only a peripheral layer of cytosol without nuclei, ribosomes, 
and tonoplasts, with rare occurrence of mitochondria, plas-
tids, and smooth endoplasmic reticulum (not shown).

C4 leaf development in Cleome | 3531
In Stage 4, observed in the leaf tip (~5.5–6 mm from the 
base), differentiation of chloroplasts and mitochondria is com-
pleted and there is full formation of Glossocardioid-type Kranz 
anatomy. Chloroplasts of BS cells have numerous grana with 
5–15 thylakoids in stacks, while M chloroplasts have poorly 
developed grana usually with 2–3 thylakoids in stacks (Fig. 2H, 
I). BS mitochondria are larger and more numerous compared 
with Stage 3, with cristae showing a distinct tubular structure 
(Fig. 2L). BS organelles maintain their characteristic position-
ing in the cell. Also, multiple plasmodesmata connect BS cells 
with M, as was noted in Stage 3 (Fig. 2N; Table 1). Between 
Stages 2 and 4, there is not a significant difference in the thick-
ness of the BS cell wall towards the IAS; however, the BS cell 
walls are about twice as thick as those in M cells (Table 1).
Stages of chlorenchyma development in C. gynandra
Compared with C.  angustifolia, in C.  gynandra the basal 
meristematic zone is extended, with delimitation of BS cells 
occurring after 1 mm. Development of Kranz anatomy was 
followed in cross-sections of veins of the highest orders (4 
and 5, minor veins) along the longitudinal section from the 
base, where cell proliferation occurs, to the tip where BS and 
M cells are differentiated. While in general the veins differ -
entiate basipetally, the differentiation of neighbouring veins 
alternates according to their order and timing of initiation, 
with corresponding changes in development of BS cells. On 
the other hand, M cells have a clear longitudinal developmen-
tal gradient from the base to the tip of the leaf, which is inde-
pendent of the level of vein and BS differentiation.
At the earliest stages near the base of the leaf, the BS cells 
are identified by their position adjacent to developing vein 
tissues, and subsequently by their size and roundish shape 
(Fig.  1K–N). In Stage 1 (~1–3 mm from the base), anticli-
nal and radial cell divisions occur in M and BS cells; the two 
types of cells have nearly the same appearance, with the BS 
cells being a little wider (Fig. 1L; Table 1). Vascular bundles 
are not differentiated and they appear as multiplying procam-
bium cells (Fig. 1L).
Recognition of Stage 2 in C. gynandra is associated struc-
turally with transition of M cells from division to expansion 
(~4–5.5 mm from the base). BS cells of the highest order veins 
are characterized by the vacuoles which are asymmetrically

forming at the centrifugal pole (Figs 1M, 3A) which ulti-
mately results in the shift of organelles to the centripetal 
position in Stage 3.  As in C.  angustifolia, at this stage of 
development BS and M chloroplasts are enlarged compared 
with Stage 1 (Table 1) and they have a similar thylakoid sys-
tem with numerous small grana (Fig. 3D, E). The mitochon-
dria are small with crescent-like cristae (Fig. 3J for BS cell). 
Most leaf tissues are tightly packed. The BS cell wall is about 
twice as thick as the M cell wall, and there are multiple plas-
modesmata connecting BS and M cells (Table  1). In veins, 
there is the beginning of differentiation of xylem and phloem 
elements.
At Stage 3 of development (~5.5–6.5 mm from the base), 
M and BS cell structural specialization becomes clearer, with 
well-developed central vacuoles in the M cells and distinc-
tive centripetal organelle positioning in BS cells (Figs 1N , 
3B). Chloroplasts of both cell types have increased in size 
(Table 1) and they have a similar level of grana development 
(Fig.  3F, G). Bundle sheath mitochondria have increased 
in number and are localized towards the inner cell wall 
(Fig. 3L). At this stage, the BS cell walls have continued to 
thicken and there is no change in plasmodesmata number 
per unit of cell wall length between the M and BS (Fig. 3M; 
Table  1). Also, differentiation of 2–3 xylem tracheary ele-
ments and first phloem sieve elements has occurred at this 
stage of development.
In Stage 4, at the leaf tip (~6.5–7 mm from the base), the 
Atriplicoid type of Kranz anatomy is fully developed. The size 
of M and BS cells and chloroplasts increased (Table 1). The 
ultrastructural dimorphism of the chloroplast and mitochon-
dria has formed. Chloroplasts of M cells usually have 2–3 thy-
lakoids in grana stacks, while BS chloroplasts have numerous 
grana with 4–10 thylakoids in stacks (Fig. 2H, I). BS cells have 
abundant, large mitochondria with distinct tubular cristae 
(Fig. 3N). The BS cell wall facing the IAS is four times thicker 
than in M; the numbers of plasmodesmata between the M and 
BS are similar to those in Stage 3 (Fig. 3O; Table 1).
Stomatal initiation from epidermal cells occurred along 
the longitudinal leaf gradient, with a clear progression in the 
portion of fully differentiated stomata from the base to mid-
region to the tip which was similar for the two species (8, 26, 
and 72%, respectively, in C. angustifolia and 5, 33, and 69%, 
respectively in C.  gynandra) (Supplementary Fig. S1 avail-
able at JXB online). Supplementary Fig. S1 shows images of 
the abaxial surface of the leaves (results were similar for the 
adaxial surface, not shown).

C4 leaf development in Cleome | 3533
Immunolabelling along the developmental gradient
The pattern of PEPC, Rubisco LSU, and GDC expression 
was studied on longitudinal sections of intermediate size 
leaves (~6–7 mm) using the reflected/scanning mode of confo-
cal microscopy. The more precise immunogold technique by 
TEM was used to analyse the base, mid-region, and tip of 
the same leaf to evaluate the density of labelling in cellular 
compartments.
In both Cleome species, Rubisco is strongly associated with 
BS chloroplasts from Stage 1 when M and BS cells become 
distinguishable (Figs 4A, C, 5). Rubisco is suppressed not 
only in chloroplasts in M cells adjacent to BS (M
ad and Mab), 
but also in the SM cells which are not in contact with the BS 
cells (Figs 4G , H, 5). Rubisco accumulation per BS chloro-
plast area reaches a maximum level in Stage 3 (Figs 4B , H, 
5), and maintains a high level in Stage 4 at the tip of leaves 
(Figs 4C, I, 5).
In both species there is selective labelling of GDC in BS 
mitochondria in Stage 1. In C. angustifolia GDC expression 
increases and reaches a maximum at Stage 2 of development, 
which is well before BS cell differentiation and mitochondrial 
structural specialization. In C. gynandra a steady increase of 
GDC was shown in parallel with an increase in BS Rubisco 
levels (Fig. 5) and cell structural maturation.
PEPC was not detected by immunolocalization in Stage 
1 (not shown). In Stage 2, at the confocal microscopy level, 
there is very low M-specific labelling for PEPC in both Cleome 
species (Fig. 4D, J). The TEM level shows a low and compa-
rable amount of PEPC selectively localized in M
ad cells and 
in both Mab and SM cells (Fig. 5). Both methods show steady 
accumulation of PEPC preferentially in M cells, with levels 
reaching a maximum at the tip of the leaf (Stage 4) with little 
or no difference in particle density between M
ab cells adjacent 
to BS and the SM layers (Figs 4E, F, K, L, 5). Compared 
with the M ad cells, the expression of PEPC begins earlier in 
the Mab and SM cells, and usually the density of labelling is 
higher in these cells at all stages of leaf development (Fig. 5). 
For C.  gynandra, comparative counting of the number of 
particles in the M cells located around the neighbouring veins 
of different order (with a different level of BS differentiation) 
shows no difference (not shown).
Western blot analysis
Western blots were performed on extractions of total sol-
uble proteins from individual leaves (young leaves of dif-
ferent lengths, 1–3, 3–6, 6–10, and 10–15 mm, and mature 
leaves, 30–35 mm) (Fig.  6). Proteins for the C
3 pathway 
(Rubisco), C 4 cycle (PEPC, PPDK, and NAD-ME), and 
photorespiratory pathway (GDC) were analysed and rep-
resented quantitatively (on a soluble protein basis). The 
youngest leaves (1–3 mm) of both Cleome species contain 
22–26% of Rubisco (LSU) compared with the mature stage, 
with a slow increase in leaves up to 6–10 mm long and a 
large increase thereafter. The youngest leaves (1–3 mm) of 
C. gynandra contain a low amount of C
4 enzymes; only 12% 
of PEPC, 6% of PPDK, and 8% of NAD-ME compared 
with mature leaves on a soluble protein basis; there was a 
slow rise in levels in leaves up to 10 mm long, and a large 
increase thereafter. In contrast, the youngest leaves of 
C.  angustifolia have a high amount of C
4 enzymes which 
on average is 40% of that in the mature stage, with increas-
ing levels as leaf age progressed. The level of GDC shows 
a steady increase from the youngest up to mature leaves, 
with higher expression in C. gynandra than in C. angustifo-
lia (Fig. 6).
CO2 compensation point, dark respiration, and carbon 
isotope composition in C. gynandra
Г and R d were measured at 10, 20, and 40% O 2 in young 
(~7 mm) and mature leaves of C.  gynandra ( Fig.  7). Г was 
insensitive to increases in O 2 in both; however, the mean 
value of Г  across all O 2 levels was higher in the young 
(13.7 ± 1.7  μbar) than in mature leaves (2.6 ± 0.8  μbar). 
Rates of Rd were higher in young than in mature leaves, with 
mean values across O 2 levels of 2.91 ± 0.33 in young versus 
0.91 ± 0.08 μmol m–2 s–1 in mature leaves. Excised leaves of 
C. angustifolia were unstable in the leaf chamber, so it was 
not possible to obtain steady-state readings with the mass 
spectrometer. Values of carbon isotope composition (δ
13C) 
measured from leaf sections of C. gynandra at the base, tip, 
and middle of young leaves were –14.1 (±0.03), –14.1 (±0.02), 
and –14.7 (±0.08), respectively, compared with –14.6 (±0.12) 
in mature leaves.
Discussion
Origin of M and BS cells in C4 Cleome
Cleome angustifolia and C. gynandra have compound leaves 
with a similar pattern of initiation, but with distinct differ -
ences in the patterns of minor veins and Kranz anatomy 
spatial development. In C.  angustifolia, which has a form 
of Kranz (called Glossocardioid) that consists of a single 
complex unit, M and BS cells originate from subepidermal 
layers of ground meristem during leaflet initiation. The 
pattern of origins of M and BS cells is very close to that 
in S.  taxifolia which has Schoberioid-type anatomy with a 
similar positioning of two chlorenchyma layers at the leaf 
periphery (Koteyeva et  al., 2011a). In C.  gynandra, which 
has Atriplicoid-type anatomy with Kranz units around indi-
vidual veins, the BS cells towards the adaxial side are sister 
to procambium cells arising from the adaxial derivative of 
the first periclinal division of the ground meristem cell (the 
abaxial derivative gives rise to the procambium initial). The 
rest of the BS cells ontogenetically originate from the ground 
meristem cells of the second, third, and fourth layers adjacent 
to the vein. M cells are also derived from the ground meristem 
having different ontogeny, namely subepidermal and central 
cells, which is similar to that of A. rosea with Atriplicoid-type 
anatomy (Liu and Dengler, 1994). In both C. angustifolia and 
C. gynandra it is difficult to reveal the progenitor cells of the 
shoot apical meristem due to initiation of leaflets from the 
primary primordium which is the future petiole. As shown

three developmental stages. Reflected/transmitted confocal imaging of longitudinal leaf sections shows Rubisco LSU selectively localized to BS cells 
beginning from developmental Stage 2 (A, G); note labelling in the few chloroplasts in the epidermis and water storage cells (A). The weak labelling for 
PEPC is M specific from the earliest stages (D, J), with increased labelling beginning from Stage 3 (E, K). At Stage 4, high labelling for Rubisco and 
PEPC is partitioned to BS and M, respectively. BS, bundle sheath; E, epidermis; M

in previous studies, the ontogenetic origin of M and BS cells 
has no effect on the structural, biochemical, and functional 
peculiarities of C
4 tissues which shows a clear convergent evo-
lution of a highly coordinated functioning of the two-cell sys-
tem (Dengler et al., 1985, 1986, 1996; Koteyeva et al., 2011a).
Longitudinal patterns of development in C4 Cleome
The form of Kranz in leaves of C. angustifolia allows all stages 
of the developmental progression to be studied along one file 
of chlorenchyma cells from the base to the tip of an intermedi-
ate size leaf. A similar basipetal pattern of development along 
a single lineage of cells has also been observed in two other 
forms having a single compound Kranz unit (Schoberioid 
and Salsinoid type in family Chenopodiaceae, Koteyeva et al., 
2011a), and in several C
4 monocots with parallel venation 
(Langdale et al., 1988a; Soros and Dengler, 2001; Wakayama 
et al., 2003; Li et al., 2010; Majeran et al., 2010; Nelson, 2011).
In contrast to C. angustifolia, development of Kranz anat-
omy in leaves of C. gynandra is closely associated with vein 
differentiation. Having in general a longitudinal basipetal 
pattern, the initiation of minor veins is sequential in time. 
Veins at different stages of differentiation in C.  gynandra, 
which are alternate in the longitudinal section, can be easily 
recognized by size, anatomy, chloroplast ultrastructure, and 
accumulation of Rubisco in the BS cells. The pattern of vas-
cular development in C. gynandra, and associated progression 
in specialization of BS cells, resembles that described for C
4 
A. rosea (Dengler et al., 1995), C4 A. hypochondriacus (Wang 
et al., 1993), and C4 Flaveria trinervia (McKown and Dengler, 
2009).
Stages of C4 development along the leaf
Irrespective of having vastly different Kranz anatomi-
cal types, C. angustifolia and C. gynandra have a similar

with the BS cells; and SM (spongy mesophyll), an additional M layer on the abaxial side of the leaf which does not have contact with BS. In both graphs,

sequence of events during C 4 leaf development. However, 
the lengths of the zones along the leaves where transi-
tions occur are different between the two species, which 
may be related to differences in anatomy or growth rates. 
Four notable stages in C
4 development were recognized 
from base to tip of young leaves of both species based 
on anatomical and ultrastructural features (illustrated in 
Fig. 8).
Structural development
Stage 1, the beginning of Kranz, is distinguished by M and 
BS cells which are positionally delimited from meristem pre-
cursors, performing anticlinal/radial divisions and having 
similar shape and structure with ultrastructurally uniform 
organelles. In Stage 2 there is expansion of M and BS cells, 
vacuoles are developing, and chloroplasts and mitochondria 
are replicating and enlarging. The plasmodesmata frequency

between M and BS cells is also high at this time. In Stage 
3, structural specialization of M and BS begins. The M cells 
develop a palisade-like shape with a large central vacuole 
and organelles around the cell periphery. Organelles in BS 
cells become localized in a centripetal position towards the 
inner cell wall characteristic of mature Kranz anatomy in 
C
4 Cleome species. The chloroplasts, and the mitochondria, 
between M and BS cells are structurally similar, indicating an 
immature stage of development. In Stage 4, full Kranz anat-
omy has developed, with structurally specialized dimorphic 
chloroplasts and mitochondria in M and BS cells.
There were some structural parameters which show a con-
tinuous change along the leaf gradient. In both species there 
was an increase in the sizes of M and BS cells, chloroplasts, 
and mitochondria, and in stomatal development and density 
(illustrated on the left side of Fig. 8). There was an increase 
in the length of the M cells with no change in width, while 
there was an ~2-fold increase in both the length and width of 
the BS cells. During development there is continual enlarge-
ment of M and BS chloroplasts, with an increase in length 
by ~3-fold in both species. The density of plasmodesmata at 
the interphase between M and BS cells increases or remains 
constant (see Table 1) despite the increase in size of M and 
BS cells (and contact between the two) due to the formation 
of secondary plasmodesmata during development. This indi-
cates establishment of symplastic connections between M 
and BS from the earliest stages of development which enables 
intercellular movement of metabolites for C
4 photosynthesis. 
In both species, BS cell wall thickening, which starts soon 
after the BS cell become positionally delimited, is considered

to contribute to diffusive resistance and limit CO 2 leakage 
from the BS during C 4 photosynthesis (von Caemmerer and 
Furbank, 2003).
Biochemical development
In both species there is a very early cell-specific C 4-like pat-
tern of enzyme accumulation. BS cells complete divisions, 
and initiate cell expansion with multiplication of chloroplasts 
and mitochondria earlier than M cells which continue to have 
active anticlinal divisions up to Stage 2. However, biochemi-
cal specialization in M and BS begins simultaneously from 
the meristematic zone in Stage 1. Rubisco and GDC are selec-
tively expressed in chloroplasts and mitochondria, respec-
tively, in BS cells, and at the same time they are suppressed in 
chloroplasts and mitochondria of the M cells, characteristic 
of the C
4 system. So, while organelles, chloroplasts and mito-
chondria, do not become ultrastructurally differentiated in BS 
and M until full maturation of Kranz, biochemical speciali-
zation of organelles in the two chlorenchyma cells is occur -
ring already in the meristematic stages right after the layers 
become positionally delimited. This shows that Rubisco and 
GDC expression in these two Cleome species is not directly 
associated with structural differentiation of M and BS cells.
Early cell-specific Rubisco expression during leaf develop-
ment has also been observed in several other C
4 species, includ-
ing Arundinella hirta (Wakayama et al., 2003), A. rosea (Dengler 
et al., 1995), S. eltonica, and S. taxifolia (Koteyeva et al., 2011a). 
In contrast, a C3 default state with Rubisco appearing initially 
in both M and BS chloroplasts has been observed in other C4 
species, with selective expression of Rubisco in BS depending 
on light or developmental cues in maize (Sheen and Bogorad, 
1985; Langdale et al., 1988b; Sheen, 1999), in A. hypochondria-
cus (Patel and Berry, 2008), in three structural forms of C
4 in 
family Cyperaceae (Soros and Dengler, 2001), and in Salsola 
richteri (Voznesenskaya et al., 2003b). Clearly these differences 
in transitions to C
4 suggest evolution of alternative cues for ini-
tiation of C4 development; although there may be convergence 
in factors (transcriptional or transacting) controlling synthesis 
of components of the C
4 system.
PEPC levels were too low to detect in Stage 1.  From its 
earliest detection in Stage 2, it was M specific and the level 
increased in parallel with M differentiation. In a number 
of other developmental studies, PEPC gene expression also 
appears to be initially M specific and increased depending on 
M differentiation (Langdale et al., 1988a; Dengler et al., 1995; 
Stockhaus et al., 1997; Soros and Dengler, 2001; Wakayama 
et al., 2003; Koteyeva et al., 2011a).
The results in both C
4 Cleome species indicate that intercel-
lular compartmentation for C 4 photosynthesis is established 
early without a C3 default state, that enzyme levels to support 
the C4 system continue to rise during the four stages of leaf 
development, and that structural positioning of organelles 
and differentiation of chloroplasts and mitochondria occur 
later (Fig. 8). This suggests that development of C
4 biochem-
istry may be a driver for organelle differentiation, namely for 
M and BS chloroplasts to provide the balance in ATP and 
NADPH from photochemistry to support the NAD-ME-
type C
4 cycle (see Edwards and Voznesenskaya, 2011), and 
for mitochondria to provide the capacity for transport and 
metabolism to support decarboxylation via NAD-ME. The 
same pattern of development in these two C
4 Cleome spe-
cies which have very different types of Kranz anatomy and 
independent evolutionary lineages is consistent with the con-
cept that genes to support the C
4 cycle were already primed 
for recruitment and selective expression in M and BS cells 
(Brown et al., 2011; Kajala et al., 2012).
A functional analysis of young versus mature leaves of 
C. gynandra was made by analysing the effect of O
2 on Г to 
determine if the response is indicative of C 4, intermediate, 
or C3 photosynthesis. C 4 plants have very low Г (1–5  μbar) 
while C3 plants have high values of Г (~40–50  μbar at 25 ○C 
and 20% O2). Additionally, Г in C4 plants has little or no sen-
sitivity to O2, while values in C3 plants approximately double 
with a 2-fold increases in O2. C3–C4 species have intermediate 
Г values, which increase with the level of O 2 (Krenzer et al., 
1975; Brooks and Farquhar, 1985; von Caemmerer, 1989, 
2000; Ku et al., 1991; Vogan et al., 2007; Voznesenskaya et al., 
2007). Mature leaves of C.  gynandra show a clear C 4-type 
response, with values of Г of ~2.5  μbar with insensitivity to 
O2. In young leaves, the lack of sensitivity of Г to O2, between 
10% and 40%, is characteristic of C4 plants. The higher Г val-
ues in young leaves (~14 μbar) are probably due to the higher 
Rd and lower Vcmax for Rubisco (see western blots), due to the 
dependence of Г on the Rd/Vcmax ratio (von Caemmerer, 2000), 
in addition to its dependence on Rubisco kinetic properties 
and the level of photorespiration. In plant leaves, R
d saturates 
at relatively low levels of O 2 (~2–3% O 2), whereas the reac-
tion of O 2 with RuBP oxygenase, in competition with CO 2, 
results in an increase in Г in response to higher levels of O 2. 
Thus, in the absence of Rd, extrapolated plots of Г versus O2 
would intercept at zero, whereas contribution from Rd results 
in the intercept on the y-axis (Brooks and Farquhar, 1985). 
Thus, the results suggest that young leaves of C. gynandra are 
functionally C
4. A factor which may minimize the occurrence 
of photorespiration and maintain a lower Г in young leaves 
is the selective localization of photosynthetic enzymes to M 
and BS cells for function of C
4 early in development. Also, 
the selective localization of GDC to the BS indicates the pres-
ence of conditions favourable for refixation of photorespired 
CO
2 around Rubisco from the very early stages of devel-
opment. As leaves develop, there is an increase in the level 
of GDC in the two Cleome species; this may be associated 
with multiplication and increase in size of BS mitochondria 
(where GDC is localized), which was observed during devel-
opment along a longitudinal gradient in young leaves (Stage 
3). There is the possibility that sensitivity of photosynthesis 
to O
2 occurs at the base of young leaves, but its contribution 
to carbon assimilation is expected to be very low (due to low 
Rubisco, and undeveloped stomata).
Expression of C4 enzymes in M cells which do not 
have contact with the BS
Both Cleome species have an additional layer of chlorenchyma 
cells on the abaxial side of leaves (SM) which is ontogeneti-
cally related to the abaxial M layer which is adjacent to the 
C4 leaf development in Cleome | 3539
BS. They are not associated with BS, and structurally resem-
ble M cells with well-developed chloroplasts. It was shown 
by confocal immunohistochemistry and TEM immunogold 
labelling that their cytosol contains PEPC at a similar level 
to that of adaxial and abaxial M cells which are in contact 
with BS. The expression of Rubisco and GDC in these distal 
M cells is suppressed, and structural and biochemical differ -
entiation of these cells occurs in parallel with the M cells in 
contact with BS.
There are not many cases where C
4 plants have more than 
two M cells between neighbouring BS cells; analysis of 119 C4 
grasses (Hattersley and Watson, 1975) showed that no M cell 
is separated from the nearest BS cell by more than one other 
M cell (the maximum cell distant count). Based on studies 
with maize, it has long been considered that M cells differen-
tiate to form a C
4-type cell only when they are in contact with 
BS; and that M cells distant from BS are deprived of PEPC 
expression and contain Rubisco in chloroplasts (Langdale 
et  al., 1988b). In maize husk having >20 additional cells 
between BS cells, the structural and biochemical speciali-
zation for C
4 was shown only in M cells which are in con-
tact with BS cells, which supports this hypothesis (Langdale 
et al., 1988b; Pengelly et al., 2011). Also, in A. rosea there is 
an extra layer of abaxial and adaxial cells which are not in 
contact with the BS cells; Dengler et  al. (1995) found that 
PEPC expression was restricted to the M cells adjacent to 
BS cells along the whole maturation gradient. However, the 
authors noted that those cells contain few organelles and are 
non-photosynthetic (hypodermal cells, probably functioning 
in water storage). Thus, the results with the two C
4 Cleome 
species, which clearly shows formation of C 4-type M cells 
which are not adjacent to the BS, is an interesting variation 
on regulation of C
4 development.
Signalling for tissue-specific development of BS and 
M cells
Veins in C4 plants have been considered to play an organizing 
role in the differentiation of Kranz anatomy as a source of the 
positional signal which controls the coordinated development 
of at least two cells in a radius around individual veins, as in 
C. gynandra, generating the pattern of Vein–BS–M–M–BS–
Vein units (Langdale et al., 1988a, b; Nelson and Langdale, 
1992; Langdale, 2012) and candidate genes which may be 
associated with differentiation of Kranz anatomy have been 
proposed (Wang et al., 2013). This is a logical hypothesis for 
the leaf structures where the anatomy consists of multiple 
simple Kranz units around individual veins which occur in 
many C
4 lineages coupled with increased leaf venation during 
evolution from C3 to C4 species (McKown and Dengler, 2007; 
Griffiths et al., 2013). However, the pattern of development 
of Kranz anatomy in the Cleome species in the current study 
is not compatible with this hypothesis. In C. gynandra, which 
has Atriplicoid-type anatomy, the structural development of 
M specialization is not correlated with BS cell development. 
Rather BS cell development is correlated with stages of dif-
ferentiation of alternate veins, but not the M cells which have 
only a basipetal gradient of maturation. Also, the hypothesis 
of signalling from vascular tissue to control differentiation 
of the M cells adjacent to BS cells is not consistent with the 
same expression pattern of C
4 in the cells of the abaxial SM 
layer not adjacent to BS. These two abaxial M layers rep-
resent sister cells which originated from the division of the 
abaxial subepidermal ground meristem; but, their segregation 
occurs before, or simultaneously with, the start of procambial 
strand initiation. One could imagine that the ‘M’ signal may 
come to the progenitor cell before its division, which could 
explain the existence of PEPC in both M layers; but, in this 
case, the signal cannot come from the undifferentiated vein. 
Also, the selective expression of PEPC in the M cells occurs 
later, during Stage 2, while the selective expression of Rubisco 
and GDC occurs during Stage 1, which suggests temporal dif-
ferences in signalling.
With respect to C. angustifolia, recently it was shown that 
evolution of C
4 species having a single compound Kranz unit 
in C4 Salsola occurs not with increasing vein density, but by 
increased succulence and development of a layer of BS cells 
around veins and water storage tissue (Voznesenskaya et al., 
2013). For differentiation of tissue for this type of anatomy, 
veins could not be the centre for a positional signal since they 
are not evenly distributed relative to the position of Kranz 
anatomy, and their contact with BS is not essential (Koteyeva 
et al., 2011a). The spatial positioning of M and BS cells rela-
tive to each other, unlike the positioning of Kranz around 
individual veins, is essential to the mechanism controlling 
their differentiation.
Concluding remarks
The results indicate that two C 4 Cleome species, which have 
different Kranz anatomy and evolved independently in fam-
ily Cleomaceae, have a similar developmental pathway for C
4 
during structural and biochemical maturation. The ontoge-
netic programme for this development involves control of 
cell-specific patterns of mitosis (rates and plane) and cell 
expansion, division of chloroplasts and mitochondria, struc-
tural differentiation and spatial distribution, cell wall modi-
fication, and plasmodesmata formation, with all of these 
characteristics occurring in close coordination with vascular 
system differentiation. The early partitioning of Rubisco, 
GDC, and PEPC expression between M and BS in both spe-
cies shows that factors controlling their cell specificity must 
be activated as soon as the tissue become delimited. Further 
regulation occurs during development, with increased levels 
of expression of photosynthetic enzymes, and structural dif-
ferentiation of M and BS cells and organelles. The results 
provide insight into stages to consider for transcriptome and 
proteomic studies to search for candidate genes which control 
structural and biochemical transitions in C
4 development.
