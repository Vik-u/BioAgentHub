Significance
 Physical binding of metabolites 
to proteins is crucial for virtually 
every biological process; 
however, functional relevance is 
known for only very few of these 
interactions. Here, we develop a 
mass spectrometry–based 
approach to elucidate functional 
relevance of metabolite binding 
to enzymes. By testing 1,600 
metabolite-enzyme combinations 
within central metabolism of the 
bacterium Escherichia coli , we 
present a systematically 
identified functional protein–
metabolite interaction network. 
Despite central metabolism being 
one of the best-characterized 
molecular networks, we doubled 
the known regulatory 
interactions and provide 
evidence that many existing 
database entries lack 
physiological relevance. Several 
of these newly identified 
allosteric interactions reveal 
novel regulatory logic of some of 
the most fundamental metabolic 
pathways.

Recent physical binding screens suggest that protein–metabolite interactions are 
more extensive than previously recognized. T o elucidate the functional relevance of 
these interactions, we developed a mass spectrometry–based screening method for 
higher throughput in vitro enzyme assays. By systematically quantifying the effects 
of 79 metabolites on the activity of 20 central Escherichia coli enzymes, we not only 
assess functional relevance but also gauge the depth of the current understanding 
of regulatory interactions within one of the best- characterized networks. Our iden-
tification of 50 inhibitors and 14 activators not only expands the range of known 
input signals but also uncovers novel regulatory logic. For instance, we observed that 
AMP inhibits malic enzyme to safeguard the cyclic operation of the tricarboxylic acid 
cycle, and erythrose- 4- phosphate inhibits 6- phosphogluconate dehydrogenase to redi -
rect flux from the pentose phosphate pathway into the Entner–Doudoroff pathway. 
Discrepancies between our standardized assays and existing database entries suggest 
that many previously reported interactions might occur only under specific, often 
nonphysiological conditions. Our dataset represents a systematically determined func -
tional protein–metabolite interaction network, establishing a baseline for allosteric 
regulation in central metabolism. These results enhance our understanding of the 
regulatory logic governing metabolic processes and underscore its significance in cel-
lular adaptation and growth.

 Cells modulate their metabolic activity by adjusting enzyme levels through transcriptional 
or translational regulation, as well as rapidly altering enzymatic activity through posttrans-
lational modifications or noncovalent binding of metabolites ( 1 ,  2 ). Direct translation of 
intracellular metabolite concentrations into metabolic responses enables swift adaptation 
to environmental changes and maintenance of homeostasis by interfering with binding of 
substrates to enzymes or allosteric modulation. The best-understood metabolite regulation 
is allosteric feedback inhibition in amino acid and nucleotide biosynthesis ( 3 ) and rapid 
reversal of pathway fluxes such as changing from glycolysis to gluconeogenesis ( 3 ,  4 ). 
Currently, databases contain approximately 1500 regulatory enzyme–metabolite interactions 
for Escherichia coli  ( 5   – 7 ), the vast majority of which are not well understood in terms of 
their role in coordinating metabolism.
 For decades, research on regulatory enzyme–metabolite interactions relied primarily 
on in vitro enzymology, totaling the equivalent of an estimated 9,000 person years of 
experimental work ( 8 ), but recent systematic physical interaction studies suggest that this 
interaction space might be much larger ( 9     – 12 ). Chemoproteomic mapping of ten glyc-
olytic metabolites revealed almost 2,500 interactions with more than 900 target proteins 
in human cells ( 13 ). T wo recent investigations of physical protein–metabolite interactions 
more than doubled the number of known interactions in E. coli’s  central metabolism ( 14 , 
 15 ), underscoring that the extent of allosteric regulation in even this well-studied network 
is still far from complete. A trivial explanation may be that in vitro studies typically report 
only a small set of regulators that were intuitively selected ( 1 ). With negative results rarely 
being reported, it is impossible to know how much of the possible interaction space has 
been probed so far. Moreover, assay conditions such as temperature, pH, and buffer 
composition usually optimize enzymatic activity rather than mimic physiological condi-
tions ( 16 ), contesting whether all reported interactions matter in vivo. Conversely, sys-
tematic physical interaction studies lack functional context and display low overlap 
between studies ( 14 ,  15 ), leaving the true scope of regulatory enzyme–metabolite inter-
actions uncertain. Comprehensive inquiries into their functional implications are ham-
pered by the inability of present methods to simultaneously investigate a wide array of

interactions with both appropriate throughput and physiological 
relevance ( 17 ).
 T o gauge the depth of our current knowledge, we systematically 
mapped out functional enzyme regulation through metabolite bind-
ing in E. coli’s  central metabolism, presumably one of the best-  
characterized systems. Our approach involved devising a screening 
pipeline for in vitro enzyme assays based on high- throughput 
mass-spectrometry (MS). This approach enabled systematic exami-
nation of potential regulatory interactions between 79 metabolites 
and 20 purified enzymes in standardized assays. At a 5% false-positive 
rate, we recovered most well-characterized interactions, questioned 
the in vivo relevance of several previously reported interactions, and 
newly identified 50 inhibitors and 14 activators. The outcome rep-
resents a systematically inferred network of functional enzyme regu-
lation via metabolite binding in any organism. 
Results
High- Throughput In  Vitro Enzyme Assays in Standardized 
Conditions. We systematically investigated enzyme regulation via 
noncovalent metabolite- binding in E. coli’s central metabolism, 
focusing on major isoforms of monomeric and homomultimeric 
enzymes with commercially available substrates and cofactors. 
Excluding isomerases because identical reactant masses preclude 
MS analysis by flow injection (18), we selected 25 enzymes meeting 
these criteria and purified them via His- tag affinity purification 
from the ASKA strain library (19). However, five enzymes (FbaA, 
GapA, Mdh, Pgk, and Pps) could not be adequately purified 
using higher- throughput methods or were catalytically inactive 
(Dataset S1).
 We systematically tested 79 endogenous metabolites, including 
central metabolites, cofactors, nucleotides, and global regulators 
(Dataset S2 ). This set included 57 previously reported enzyme–
metabolite interactions affecting enzyme activity. Our method 
involved measuring enzymatic progress curves in the presence and 
absence of these potential effector molecules. T o efficiently manage 
the time-resolved combinations of 20 enzymes with 79 metabo-
lites in two biological and two technical replicates, we took advan-
tage of high-throughput flow injection analysis (FIA) MS ( 18 ), a 
nontargeted metabolomics method. This allows direct detection 
of substrate depletion and product accumulation in reactions 
without the need for a second reaction generating optically detect-
able molecules, which potentially confounds interpretation.
 T o standardize single enzyme reaction monitoring, we used 
MS-compatible buffer conditions and metabolite concentrations 
suitable for detecting activators and inhibitors, mimicking in vivo 
conditions without introducing potentially confounding factors. 
All enzyme assays were conducted at 37 °C and pH 7.5 in 10 mM 
HEPES buffer. Metal cofactors were provided in excess to mitigate 
the risk of false positives due to metabolite–cofactors interactions. 
All substrates were supplied at 1 mM, exceeding most reported 
KM  values in central metabolism (SI Appendix, Fig. S1 ), mimick-
ing typical cellular substrate concentrations that are usually about 
10-fold higher than enzyme K M -values ( 20 ). Monitoring entire 
progress curves instead of just initial velocities captured enzymatic 
velocity across a wide range of substrate and product concentra-
tions in each assay. Each potential effector was tested at 5 mM, a 
concentration surpassing reported in vivo steady-state concentra-
tions for nearly all tested metabolites ( 20   – 22 ) (SI Appendix, 
Fig. S2 ). In each 96-well microtiter plate assay, we tested the 79 
potential effector metabolites and controls without effector or to 
exclude effects of salts or metal ions that are often part of com-
mercially acquired metabolites (e.g. sodium or potassium salt 
hydrates; Dataset S2 ). Aliquots were collected and quenched with 
−20 °C methanol at eight exponentially spaced timepoints (default: 
0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 min), aiming to cover a wide range 
of turnovers and enable detection of early activator effects while 
allowing reactions to approach equilibrium. Each assay was per-
formed in at least two replicates that were measured twice in tech-
nical replicates using FIA-MS ( Fig. 1A  ).        
 An automated custom-built analysis pipeline was set up to ana-
lyze MS time-course data for 1,580 enzyme–metabolite combi-
nations and controls. Beyond published processing of FIA data 
( 18 ), this included normalizing ion counts to the total ion count 
to correct for variations in injection volumes and filtering faulty 
injections or highly variable assays. For each enzyme, we extracted 
timeseries of two to four substrate and product ions (deproto-
nated, [M-H− ]). The pipeline identified the most reliable reactants 
for each enzyme based on the SD of replicates for reactants with 
redundant information and fitting enzymatic progress curves, 
ensuring high-quality data for analysis.  Fig. 1 B –D   illustrates 
resulting timeseries for the reactants of 6-phosphogluconate dehy-
drogenase (Gnd) assays, visually displaying the impact of added 
effectors on the reaction velocity. Based on chemical properties 
that cause different degrees of ion suppression, raw progress curves 
expectedly exhibited various degrees of signal suppression upon 
addition of potential effectors because they compete for ionization 
with the reactants ( Fig. 1B  ).
 Our method bypasses the need for time-consuming calibration 
curves or liquid chromatography to avoid ion suppression by 
scaling ion counts within each assay from start to end points. Due 
to the constancy of reaction equilibrium despite changes in 
enzyme velocity, we can scale least-squares fits based on an ana-
lytical solution to the reactant concentration over time for enzy-
matic reactions with Haldane kinetics (also known as reversible 
Michaelis–Menten; see Materials and Methods  section titled 
“Functions Used for Fitting Enzymatic Progress Curves ”). Instead of 
solely focusing on best-fit areas under the curve (AUC), we broad-
ened our analysis by resampling mean and SD of each of the eight 
timepoints 200 times for each eligible ion, individually fitting and 
scaling them, thus encompassing the entire potential AUC range 
( Fig. 1C  ). When comparing scaled and fitted progress curves 
obtained via FIA-MS with classical photometer assay results from 
a similar setup, such as inhibition of Gnd by erythrose-4-phosphate 
(E4P) or 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-phosphogluconate (kgpd), we found 
qualitative agreement ( Fig. 1E  ). This method not only streamlines 
measurements but also showcases qualitative consistency between 
our FIA-MS approach and established photometric assays.
 T o systematically assess effector function and gauge their impact 
on the activity of enzymes with varying progress curve shapes, we 
related observed AUC differences to estimated activity changes. 
Our curve-fitting model not only facilitated precise quantification 
of AUC but also was founded in enzyme kinetics, allowing us to 
simulate how changes in kinetic parameters would alter progress 
curves. For each enzyme, we applied our curve- fitting model to 
the overlaid progress curves from all control assays (i.e., those con-
ducted without effectors) to obtain the best-fit parameters. With 
all other parameters fixed, we varied the kcat  parameter (via the β  
parameter, as described in the Methods section) to simulate new 
progress curves. While effectors can influence kcat , KM , or both—
depending on their mechanism of action—we relied on changes 
in kcat  as a conceptual proxy. The relationship between changes in 
kcat  and the AUC of simulated progress curves allowed us to trans-
late progress curve areas in all other assays to estimated fold-changes 
in these parameters and, thereby, enzymatic activity ( Fig. 1D  ). The 
final score for each enzyme–effector combination was calculated 
as the log2 -fold activity change at the first quartile across fits from 
eligible reactants, indicating that 75% of the datapoints had equal

or higher changes. Notably, varying scoring metrics had minimal 
impact on results (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 ). This scoring system pro-
vided a quantifiable ranking for inhibitors and activators, enabling 
systematic comparison across all assays (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 ). Out 
of the 1,580 enzyme–effector combinations tested, 1,381 were 
deemed reliable based on technical criteria, which included meet-
ing quality standards for ion traces, ensuring that tested metabolites 
were not the main reactants of the enzyme, confirming no precip-
itation events, and ruling out any influence of salts in the metab-
olite mix on enzymatic activity.  
MS–Based Screening of Regulatory Enzyme–Metabolite Inter­
actions and Photometric Validation Experiments.  T o identify 
regulatory events among the 1,381 reliably tested enzyme–
effector pairs, we matched our ranked table (Dataset S3) against 
57 previously reported regulatory combinations in the Ecocyc 
and BRENDA databases. Using receiver operating characteristic 
analysis, we determined a scoring threshold for our ranked table 
by assessing the database overlap with the percentage of assays 
identified as hit at various scoring thresholds. The analysis revealed 
an AUC of 0.79 for Ecocyc and 0.71 for BRENDA (Fig. 2A). 
At a false- positive rate below 5% (scoring threshold: 1.131), the 
overlap with reported interactions was 40% for Ecocyc and 28% 
for BRENDA (Fig. 2B).
 At a false-positive rate of 4.2% for Ecocyc and 4.8% for Brenda, 
we found 50 new inhibiting and 14 activating interactions, 25% 
of which exhibited strong effects, i.e., 12 inhibitors and five acti-
vators changed enzyme activity more than fourfold ( Fig. 2 E  and 
 F  ). This effectively doubled the number of known functional 
interactions in our tested combinations. Surprisingly, around 60% 
of previously reported interactions in Ecocyc and 69% including 
BRENDA could not be recovered. Even with a much lower thresh-
old that would threefold increase false-positives, still 53% of lit-
erature entries from the databases would be missed ( Fig. 2 C  and 
 D  ). While some reported interactions were only slightly below 
the threshold, the vast majority were assigned a low score that 
cannot be explained by the chosen threshold. This discrepancy 
suggests either a large fraction of false-negatives, and potentially

Fig. 1.   High- throughput in vitro screening for enzyme activity effectors. (A) Experimental setup. His- tagged enzymes purified from an overexpression library were 
screened in microtiter plate assays under standardized conditions with 1 mM reactants and 5 mM potential effectors. In each assay, aliquots were quenched 
at eight timepoints (dashed lines) and metabolite ions detected with untargeted high- throughput flow- Injection time- of- flight (FIA- TOF) MS. (B–D) Data analysis, 
exemplarily shown for the substrates (NADP+ [M- H]−) and products (D- ribulose- 5- phosphate [M- H]−; NADPH [M- H]−) of 6- phosphogluconate dehydrogenase 
(Gnd). The acquired progress curves depicting product accumulation or substrate depletion with and without potential effectors including 2- dehydro- 3- deoxy- 
phosphogluconate (kdpg) and erythrose- 4- phosphate (e4p) (B) were rescaled to a range of 0 (start) and 1 (equilibrium). These scaled curves were then fitted 
based on an analytical solution to enzymatic progress curves with Haldane kinetics in a bootstrapping approach involving resampling the mean and SD of each 
timepoint, then fitting and scaling the curves for each resample (C). Error bars depict SD of acquired ion counts at each timepoint, and shaded areas represent 
the 95% CI derived from the bootstrapped population of fits. By fitting control assays and simulating progress curves with changes in the k cat parameter, the 
relationship between the area of progress curves and kcat was determined and then used as a proxy to quantify the impact of each tested effector on enzyme 
activity (D). Error bars correspond to 95% CI of fits in the MS- based assays and red lines show the 1st quartile; i.e., 75% of datapoints show an activity change 
larger than this value. (E) Comparison of scaled progress curves obtained in the MS- based screen versus those obtained via an NADPH- based photometric

entries are based on weak evidence or are not reproducible in our 
conditions.
 T o benchmark the capability of our MS approach to identify 
regulatory interactions, we performed classical photometric assays 
based on NAD(P)H absorption spectra with all 79 tested metab-
olites on a subset of four selected enzymes—Gnd, isocitrate dehy-
drogenase (Icd), and the NAD- and NADP-dependent MaeA and 
MaeB. These redox enzymes were chosen because their products 
NADH and NADPH can be directly quantified photometrically 
without coupled enzyme reactions and also covered varying con-
fidence levels and hit counts in our MS screen. Conditions and 
analysis of progress curves were identical to the MS screen, except 
increasing the buffer to 100 mM HEPES to rule out pH or ionic 
strength effects. We considered both strong (log 2 -fold change > 
1.131, identical to cutoff at 5% FPR in MS approach) and weak

(log2 -fold change > 0.566, corresponding to 14% FPR in MS 
approach) effects on enzymatic activity to avoid bias toward 
stronger effectors.
 All ten inhibitors and activators with high MS-based scores were 
also confirmed in the photometric assays ( Fig. 3A   and SI Appendix, 
Fig. S5 ). Among these, seven displayed strong effects in either 
approach, while the three MaeB activators succinate, UTP , and 
citrate activated only weakly in photometric assays ( Fig. 3B  ). 
Notably, these MaeB MS hits were among the low confidence 
assays, involving only one informing reactant. Thus, both methods 
yielded highly comparable qualitative conclusions, providing evi-
dence that the substantial number of newly identified hits truly 
modulate enzymatic activity and are not false positives.        
 After confirming that all newly predicted interactions affected 
enzyme activity, we investigated why many database interactions 
were not detected in the MS screen, i.e., were classified as false 
negatives. Among the twelve regulatory interactions listed for Gnd, 
Icd, MaeA, and MaeB, ten were not found in the MS screen. Of 
the two cases identified using photometry but not MS, the aspar-
tate–MaeB interaction had a slightly below threshold MS- based 
score (score: 0.84), while showing an effect slightly above threshold 
in photometric assays (score: 1.21) ( Fig. 3B  ), and the missed inter-
action between fructose-bisphosphate and Gnd was confirmed to 
result in weak inhibition photometrically (score: 0.96). The remain-
ing eight reported cases, however, were neither confirmed by MS 
nor photometric assays. Therefore, in the case of this specific subset 
of redox enzymes, the inability to detect reported regulatory inter-
actions was not a result of the measurement technique; rather, enzy-
matic activity remained unaffected under the tested conditions.
 The literature evidence behind the eight unconfirmed cases 
varies. Conflicting evidence was reported for MaeA’s inhibition 
by acetyl-CoA ( 23 ,  24 ). For some cases, like MaeA’s inhibition by 
succinate, only weak effects (15% change in activity) were reported 
( 25 ). Additionally, several regulatory effects with MaeA, such as 
inhibition by ATP and activation by aspartate, were reported in 
the absence of the metal cofactors Mg 2+  or Mn2+  ( 26 ), while we 
used saturating concentrations. Similar conditions applied to 
MaeB’s interactions with fumarate and glucose-6-phosphate, 
where effects were solely seen in the absence of Mn2+  ( 23 ). When 
repeating our malic enzyme experiments using buffers without 
Mn2+  and low Mg 2+  concentrations, we found nonspecific 
responses to most tested metabolites (SI Appendix, Fig. S6 ), most 
pronounced was inhibition through negatively charged metabo-
lites such as triphosphates or citrate that presumably chelate lim-
iting metal cofactors. Likewise, the reported Icd inhibition by 
phosphoenolpyruvate resulted presumably from low cofactor 
concentrations ( 27 ), since we observed chelation-based effects at 
1 mM but not at 10 mM Mg2+  (SI Appendix, Fig. S7 ). This sug-
gests that previously reported effects under cofactor-limiting con-
ditions might not reflect specific regulation of an enzyme, but 
rather were the result of unspecific interactions between metabolite 
and metal cofactor.
 Beyond weak effects and limiting cofactors, the large number 
of discrepancies between our standardized assays and original 
experiments that accumulated over decades could be due to side 
effects from coupled enzyme assays or test conditions that maxi-
mized enzyme activity rather than reflect intracellular physiology. 
For instance, activation of 6- phosphofructokinase 1 (PfkA) 
through GDP is strong at low pH but weak at physiological pH 
( 28 ). Consequently, the low recovery of previously reported reg-
ulatory interactions does not seem to be attributed to our 
MS-based approach. Instead, many of these missed interactions 
might only occur under very specific, sometimes nonphysiological 
conditions. Orthogonal testing with classical photometric meth-
ods thus validated two main outcomes from our systematic 
MS-based screen: A large fraction of reported database interac-
tions might not be relevant under standardized physiological 
conditions and the space of functional enzyme–metabolite inter-
actions exceeds previous knowledge. The many newly identified 
interactions might simply not have been tested in the past because

most assays involved only few commonly tested cofactors and 
metabolites.  
Landscape of Systematically Inferred Regulatory Enzyme–
Metabolite Interactions in E. coli’s Central Metabolism.  After 
confirming the validity of our results with the subset of four redox 
enzymes, we examined the entire landscape of systematically 
identified regulatory interactions. Inhibitors of enzymatic activity 
can either bind to an allosteric site, a regulatory site distinct 
from the active site, or compete with substrates for the active 
site due to their chemical similarity Using Simcomp2 (29), we 
assessed the maximum chemical similarity between our newly 
identified inhibitors and the target enzyme’s reactants. Around 
70% of inhibitors had maximum similarities below 0.5, with 
a third even lower than 0.25 (Fig. 4A). This absence of strong 
chemical similarity between the effectors and reactants precludes 
competitive binding and thus suggests that the identified 
regulatory interactions primarily involve allosteric mechanisms.
 Among the tested metabolites, 30 did not affect any enzyme, 
while the remaining 49 metabolites affected one to three and GTP 
four enzymes (SI Appendix, Fig. S8 ). Central, redox, and nucleo-
tide metabolites affected on average 1.2, 1.25, and 1.1 enzymes, 
respectively, whereas amino acids affected about 0.5 enzymes 
( Fig. 4B  ). This suggests that regulation of central metabolism 
mainly involves central and redox metabolites, alongside nucleo-
tides and various cofactors. Rather than few metabolites controlling 
many enzymes, our findings show that most tested metabolites 
regulate few enzymes. Mapping regulatory interactions onto

central metabolism revealed little allosteric regulation in the pen-
tose phosphate (PP) pathway and TCA cycle ( Fig. 4C  ), consistent 
with previous observations ( 5   – 7 ,  14 ). Regulation hotspots with 
more than 10 effectors were the NADP+-dependent malic enzyme 
MaeB, the glycolytic pyruvate kinase (PykF), the gluconeogenic 
fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase (Fbp), the anaplerotic PEP carboxy-
lase (Ppc), and isocitrate lyase (AceA) in the glyoxylate shunt. 
Expectedly, many effectors affected enzymes catalyzing irreversible 
reactions that determine flux direction (e.g., Fbp and PfkA) and 
anaplerotic reactions (e.g., Ppc and malic enzymes) ( Fig. 4D  ). In 
contrast, intermediate reactions were generally targeted by few or 
no regulators. Apart from AceA, enzymes at split nodes were 
affected by few metabolites, such as Zwf catalyzing the first reaction 
of the PP pathway or GltA in the TCA cycle.
 Several newly identified regulatory events echo established reg-
ulatory patterns. For instance, the irreversible glycolytic enzymes 
PfkA and PykF are active during glycolysis but must be inactivated 
during gluconeogenesis to avoid futile cycling and ATP waste 
( 30 ). T o achieve such a response, PfkA is inhibited by the lower 
glycolysis metabolite phosphoenolpyruvate and activated by ADP , 
a signal for low energy availability ( 3 ). Our findings show that 
also the lower glycolysis intermediates bisphosphoglycerate and 
3-phosphoglycerate inhibit PfkA, while NAD+  strongly activates 
it, representing another signal of energy depletion ( Fig. 5A  ). 
Similarly, in lower glycolysis, PykF is strongly activated by the 
upper glycolysis metabolite fructose-bisphosphate ( 31 ) and inhib-
ited by succinyl-CoA and the nucleotide GTP that is intrinsically 
linked to cellular energy availability. Correspondingly, we found 
that the upstream glycolysis metabolite 2- phosphoglycerate 
strongly activates PykF . Moreover, the TCA cycle metabolite aco-
nitate and the nucleotide (d)TTP were identified as strong inhib-
itors ( Fig. 5A  ).        
 Other identified regulatory events revealed novel regulatory logic. 
For instance, the discovered feedback inhibition of Gnd by the PP 
pathway intermediate erythrose-4-phosphate ( Fig. 5B  ). Presumably, 
the mechanism is through competitive inhibition given the moderate 
chemical similarity (0.5) of the effector to the reaction substrate 
6-phosphogluconate and high chemical similarity (0.8) to its product 
ribulose-5-phosphate. While NADPH product inhibition was 
known to regulate the PP pathway at the initial enzyme Zwf ( 32 ), 
this finding adds a second control point further down the pathway. 
Gnd plays a crucial role at the split node between the PP pathway 
and the Entner–Doudoroff pathway. This feedback inhibition of Gnd 
by erythrose-4-phosphate could redirect flux toward the Entner–
Doudoroff pathway during high PP pathway flux when PP pathway 
intermediate levels are elevated. Previously thought to be mostly 
inactive in E. coli , the Entner–Doudoroff pathway was recently found 
to provide a selective advantage during rapid nutrient upshifts ( 33 ). 
The feedback inhibition of Gnd could be an underlying mechanism 
for this phenomenon.
 Another case with novel regulatory logic is the NADP+ -dependent 
malic enzyme MaeB that catalyzes the decarboxylation of malate 
to form pyruvate, thereby redirecting flux from the TCA cycle. It 
has important redox balancing functions and sits at a crucial met-
abolic crossroad, the PEP-pyruvate-oxaloacetate node that acts as 
a switch point for flux distribution ( 34 ). Beyond the known inhi-
bition of MaeB by acetyl-CoA and oxaloacetate that initiate the 
TCA cycle ( 35 ,  36 ), we showed that not only rising levels of 
fumarate but also of citrate and succinate activate MaeB ( Fig. 5C  ), 
suggesting that imbalanced or at capacity TCA cycle fluxes 
allosterically redirect flux from the cyclic operation to pyruvate. 
Conversely, we found AMP as a signal for low energy to be a 
potent inhibitor of MaeB ( Fig. 5C  ), safeguarding energy produc-
tion via the TCA cycle by preventing this flux diversion when 
energy is sparse. As an exception to the above MaeB activation 
through TCA cycle intermediates, both MaeB ( Fig. 5C  ) and its 
isozyme MaeA ( Fig. 4C  ) where strongly inhibited by another cycle 
intermediate: alpha-ketoglutarate. This metabolite is intricately 
related to nitrogen metabolism where the inhibition of MaeB may 
contribute to sustained TCA cycle fluxes under nitrogen limita-
tion, where it accumulates up to 10 mM ( 37 ).
 The three enzymes with the highest number of regulators were 
Fbp, AceA, and acetate kinase (AckA). In the case of Fbp, only 
one ion trace was informative ( Fig. 2F  ) and the effects were com-
paratively small (SI Appendix, Fig. S4 ). As the first enzyme of the 
glyoxylate shunt, AceA was inhibited strongly by pyruvate and 
oxaloacetate ( Fig. 5C  ) and more mildly by further intermediates 
of glycolysis and TCA cycle ( Fig. 4C  ). High oxaloacetate levels 
indicate sufficient availability of carbon backbones in the TCA 
cycle and thus prevent further anaplerotic flux through the glyox-
ylate shunt to generate four carbon molecules during growth on 
acetate. The acetate-producing AckA was inhibited by AMP , GMP ,

and IMP . Given that overflow secretion of acetate generates less 
ATP than respiration, this newly identified inhibition constitutes 
a plausible mechanism to redirect flux toward respiration when 
the cellular energy state is low.   
Discussion
 The vast repository of meticulously conducted in vitro experi-
ments ( 8 ) has been collected in databases ( 6 ,  7 ) and provides broad 
molecular knowledge on metabolism and its regulation. Yet, recent 
physical interaction screens suggested the spectrum of regulatory 
enzyme–metabolite interactions may be far more extensive than 
previously recognized ( 9           – 15 ). T o assess the comprehensiveness of 
our knowledge of E. coli ’s central metabolism, a screening method 
was employed to systematically map functional enzyme regulation. 
This approach yielded the identification of 50 inhibitors and 14 
activators, more than doubling the previously documented regu-
latory effects of metabolites in this well-characterized network. In 
many cases, discovered regulatory interactions broaden the range 
of input signals that convey similar information. For instance, the 
activation of the NADP+ -dependent enzyme MaeB through var-
ious TCA cycle intermediates. Similarly, the two irreversible 
enzymes in glycolysis are subject to feedback from several pathway 
intermediates and multiple metabolites that reflect the cellular 
energy status. This expanded information pool enables more 
adaptable and finely tuned metabolic responses.
 A noteworthy example of previously unknown regulatory logic 
is the inhibition of MaeB through the low energy signal AMP , 
presumably safeguarding cyclic operation of the TCA cycle for 
efficient energy generation. At points where metabolic pathways 
diverge, known as flux split nodes, it is common for the first 
enzyme to be inhibited by the end products of that pathway. For 
instance, the enzyme Zwf in the PP pathway is inhibited by 
NADPH ( 38 ), while GltA in the TCA cycle is inhibited by NADH 
( 39 ). However, little was known about negative feedback regula-
tion at the split node between the PP and Entner–Doudoroff 
pathways. The here-described inhibition of Gnd through the PP 
pathway intermediate erythrose-4-phosphate provides such neg-
ative feedback. This regulation allows for the redirection of flux 
into the Entner–Doudoroff pathway, which exhibits a faster 
response time than glycolysis. This regulatory mechanism may be 
important for the recently reported rapid growth acceleration 
during carbon or nitrogen upshifts, which necessitates an expe-
dited metabolic response ( 33 ). The regulatory effect may be ame-
liorated through phosphorylation of Gnd that is required for 
in vivo activity of the enzyme, potentially by promoting its inter-
action with metabolites or other proteins ( 40 ). Another case of 
end product inhibition was the effect of oxaloacetate on AceA that 
would reduce anaplerotic glyoxylate shunt flux, but may also play 
a role, jointly with pyruvate inhibition, for the PEP-glyoxylate 
cycle that is active under glucose limitation ( 41 ).
 The disparities between our standardized assays and original 
experiments conducted over decades were rather surprising. 
Although the possibility of false negatives in our experiments can-
not be ruled out, the extensive scope of these discrepancies, cou-
pled with the successful validation of our findings using classical 
photometric assays for four redox enzymes, strongly indicates 
systematic issues. Examination of original experiments for the 
tested redox enzymes revealed that many effectors reported in 
present databases exhibit weak effects, were obtained under con-
ditions of limiting cofactor concentrations, or employed test con-
ditions that maximized enzyme activity rather than mimicking 
intracellular physiology. Additionally, confounding factors such 
as unintended side effects from coupled enzyme assays in classical 
enzymology further contribute to the complexity of the situation. 
Nonetheless, it is reassuring to note that our screening process has 
successfully identified the most well-known and robust allosteric 
interactions. Notably, this includes the feedforward activation of 
PykF by fructose-bisphosphate ( 31 ) and the feedback inhibition 
of PfkA by phosphoenolpyruvate ( 42 ), both of which are crucial 
for regulating the switch between glycolysis and gluconeogenesis. 
Another prominent example is the ultrasensitive activation of Ppc 
by fructose-bisphosphate and acetyl-CoA which prevents futile 
cycling during gluconeogenesis and facilitates fast glucose import 
after periods of starvation ( 43 ).
 Mass spectrometric approaches similar to the one presented 
here are broadly applicable to other enzymes and organisms. 
However, one limitation of FIA-MS is its inability to differentiate 
between reactants with identical masses, which excludes isomerases 
from the analysis. While we did not prioritize isomerases as key 
targets of metabolic regulation, incorporating chromatographic 
separation through LC-MS would enable discrimination of iso-
meric reactants ( 44 ,  45 ). This enhancement, however, would sub-
stantially reduce throughput. Likewise, we prioritized enzymes 
that are amenable to high-throughput purification. While special-
ized purification and assay protocols could enable the study of 
membrane-bound enzymes and complexes, this too would come 
at the cost of throughput.
 Other limitations pertain to our analysis and fitting approach. 
Our primary objective was to determine whether an effect was 
occurring and to approximate its magnitude. This was achieved by 
comparing AUC values from progress curves of enzyme–metabolite 
pairs to simulations of how control assay AUCs change with alter-
ations in kcat . This process required scaling progress curves between 
the start and equilibrium points and assumed that effectors primar-
ily impacted kcat , regardless of their exact mechanisms. Moreover, 
bimolecular reactions were modeled under the assumption of reac-
tion irreversibility, idealizing binding mechanisms, and identical 
substrate concentrations, among other factors (SI Appendix, T ext 
S1 ). These simplifications facilitated the high-throughput nature of 
the study, but they may have limited the precision of the estimated 
changes. For instance, scaling progress curves between start and end 
points may have led to an underestimation of inhibitory potency 
in certain cases. Addressing these limitations would necessitate sig-
nificantly more experiments for each enzyme–metabolite combina-
tion to achieve higher timepoint resolution and a broader range of 
tested conditions. Realistically, this would only be feasible for a very 
small subset of promising cases.
 This systematic investigation of regulatory interactions in E. 
coli  provides a baseline for allosteric regulation of central metab-
olism. It reveals regulation hotspots in central metabolism that 
are primarily controlled through central and redox metabolites. 
Rather than few metabolites controlling many enzymes, most 
tested metabolites regulated only few enzymes. Collectively, these 
findings enhance our understanding of the regulatory logic gov-
erning metabolic processes and highlight their importance in 
cellular adaptation and growth.  
Materials and Methods
Enzyme Expression and Purification. All E. coli strains used in this study were 
obtained from the ASKA collection (19), an overexpression library with each strain 
containing an open reading frame of a gene from E. coli K- 12 W3110. Cells were 
inoculated in a 1:100 dilution from 5 mL LB medium precultures to shake flasks 
with 200 mL LB medium (5 g/L yeast extract, 10 g/L tryptone, 10 g/L NaCl) sup-
plemented with 100 μg/mL chloramphenicol (Sigma- Aldrich). Expression of the 
target protein was induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl β‐ D‐ 1‐ thiogalactopyranoside 
and the cultures were grown for 16 h at 37 °C with shaking (300 rpm). Cells were

harvested by centrifugation (5,000 g and 4 °C for 20 min) and pellets were resus-
pended in lysis buffer containing bacterial protein extraction reagent (B- PERTM, 
Thermo Scientific) supplemented with 500 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 1 mM 
MgCl2, 0.2 mg/mL DNase I (Roche), 2 mg/mL lysozyme (Fluka), 4 mM phen-
ylmethanesulfonyl fluoride and 10% glycerol. The suspension was shaken for  
10 min at room temperature and then cell debris was pelleted via centrifugation 
(21,000 g at 4 °C for 45 min). The supernatant containing his- tagged soluble 
proteins was collected. His- tagged proteins were purified using His GraviTrap 
TALON gravity flow columns (GE Healthcare). After loading the supernatant to the 
column, it was washed twice with 10 mL buffer containing 20 mM NaPO 4, 0.5 
M NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, and 10% (v/v) glycerol at pH 7.5. The bound protein 
was then eluted with 3 mL of a similar buffer containing 500 mM imidazole. The 
elution buffer containing the purified protein was exchanged with 5× enzyme 
buffer (50 mM HEPES, 25 mM MgCl2, 5 mM additional metal cofactors if required, 
pH 7.5) using Zeba spin desalting columns with a 7 kDa cutoff. Protein purity was 
assessed by sodium dodecyl sulfate- polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Purified 
proteins were flash- frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80 °C.
Effector Library Preparation. All metabolites, including substrates, cofactors, salt 
controls, and potential enzymatic effectors, were purchased with the highest purity 
available from Merck (Sigma- Aldrich) except for guanosine- 3′,5′- bispyrophosphate 
(ppGpp) and fructose- 1- phosphate, obtained from Jena Bioscience and Santa Cruz 
Biotechnology, respectively. To maintain consistent pH during addition of potential 
effectors and avoid potential biases due to pH shifts when adding metabolites, 
as described in literature (46), all stock solutions of potential enzymatic effectors 
and all controls were prepared in 10 mM HEPES buffer and preadjusted to pH 7.5 
using NaOH and HCl. The library included 79 potential effector metabolites, and 
every 12th sample served as a control without an effector. Additionally, controls 
containing salt and metal ions were included to account for potential effects of salts 
or metal ions, which are commonly present in commercially acquired metabolites 
(Dataset S2). Aliquots of this library were stored in 96- well plates at −80 °C.
Primary Screen: MS–Based Enzyme Activity Assays. Activity assays were con-
ducted in a 96- well format within a heating chamber maintained at 37 °C. Assay 
buffers for each enzyme were freshly prepared and adjusted to pH 7.5. They con-
tained 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM MgCl2, and substrates and cofactors specific to each 
enzyme. Substrates and organic cofactors (e.g., NADH, NADPH) were each supplied 
at a final concentration of 1 mM. If required for enzymatic activity, an additional 5 
mM of inorganic cofactors, such as MgCl2 or MnCl2, were included (Dataset S1). Each 
well of the 96- well plate received 88 µL of assay buffer and 11 µL of an effector or 
control solution from the previously prepared effector library. A pipetting robot was 
employed to ensure simultaneous initiation and sampling of all 96 assays. Before 
starting the reaction, a timepoint zero measurement was taken by withdrawing 9 
µL of the reaction mixture from each well and mixing with 1 µL of 10 mM HEPES in 
90 µL methanol precooled to −20 °C. The enzyme, previously stored in 5× enzyme 
buffer at −80 °C, was centrifuged at 20,000 g for 2 min at room temperature to 
remove precipitates, and then diluted to reach 1× enzyme buffer (10 mM HEPES, 
5 mM MgCl2, 5 mM additional metal cofactors if required, pH 7.5). A 10 µL aliquot 
of the enzyme at a concentration previously determined in preliminary tests (see 
below) was added to each well to start the reaction. At exponentially spaced time 
intervals (default: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 min), 10 µL samples were withdrawn 
and immediately mixed with 90 µL of precooled methanol provided in another 96- 
well plate, thereby denaturing the protein and quenching the enzymatic reaction. 
Plates containing methanol were precooled to −20 °C before sampling, kept on a 
cold metal rack during sampling, and subsequently stored at −80 °C. Each assay 
was performed in two experimental replicates.
Preliminary Tests: MS–Based Enzyme Activity Assays.  Before conducting 
the main activity assays as described above, a preliminary experiment was car -
ried out to determine an enzyme concentration that would achieve equilibrium 
within the experimental timeframe while the progress curve is effectively cap-
tured (SI Appendix, Fig. S10). To accomplish this, a twofold serial dilution of each 
enzyme was tested in the absence of effectors. These diluted enzyme samples 
were added to a 96- well plate in the same manner as the main assays, with 88 µL 
of assay buffer and 11 µL of assay buffer instead of an effector solution. Reactions 
were monitored at exponentially spaced time intervals (0, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, and 
128 min) identical to the approach in the main activity assays. The samples were 
measured on a mass spectrometer as outlined below and the data from these 
preliminary assays were analyzed to identify a suitable enzyme concentration for 
subsequent activity assays with effectors.
FIA- TOF MS. Enzyme assay samples were further diluted 1:1 in methanol before 
they were analyzed using a previously described untargeted metabolomics 
approach (18) utilizing a Gerstel MPS2 autosampler and an Agilent 6520 Q- TOF 
mass spectrometer. The flow rate was set to 150 µL/min with a mobile phase com-
posed of isopropanol:water (60:40, v/v) and 5 mM ammonium fluoride at pH 9.0. 
Taurocholic acid and hexakis- phosphazine were supplemented for online mass 
axis correction. Measurements were conducted in negative ionization mode, with 
spectra recorded over a mass- to- charge ratio (m/z) range of 50 to 1,000, at a rate 
of 1.4 spectra/s in extended dynamic range mode (2 GHz EDR). For each sample, 
two technical replicates were measured. To minimize potential biases and temporal 
drifts associated with extended mass spectrometer operation, the assays for each 
enzyme were measured in two sequential batches. The units 1 to 4 of effectors 
and controls were measured, followed by a cleaning and recalibration of the mass 
spectrometer before measuring units 5 to 8 of effectors and controls (Dataset S2).
Processing Spectral Data of Enzymatic Progress Curves. Spectral raw data 
(47) were preprocessed and annotated using an in- house developed pipeline in 
Matlab (The MathWorks) as described previously (18). Annotation was performed 
using reference values from the KEGG database for E. coli, assuming simple depro-
tonation ([M−H]−) and applying a mass tolerance of 0.005 Da. For each enzyme, 
timeseries data were extracted for its two to four substrate and product ions. To 
minimize artifacts, timeseries in which the ion count did not exceed a threshold 
of 5,000 were excluded. Faulty injections were identified by comparing the total 
ion count (TIC) of each sample to the median TIC of all samples that were part 
of the same effector or control condition tested on a given enzyme. Samples 
were excluded if their TIC deviated by more than 50% from the median TIC. To 
correct for variations in signal intensity and injection volumes, all ion counts were 
normalized to the median TIC across all samples measured for a given enzyme. 
Assays in which an effector was tested whose mass matches the ion of interest 
were excluded from further analysis. Following the application of these quality 
criteria, only assays with at least six out of eight time points remaining and includ-
ing values for timepoints zero were retained for further analysis. Assays that did 
not meet these criteria were classified as inconclusive.
Analysis of Enzymatic Progress Curves. From the two to four reactants of each 
enzyme, each in theory holding the same information on enzymatic activity but with 
expected variance in data quality based on their chemical properties, we selected the 
reactants with the best- quality ion traces. To this end, a least- squares fit based on a 
time- course ODE solution based on Haldane kinetics (see below) was performed on 
each timeseries from control assays (i.e., assays without effector) and we selected the 
reactants that yielded the best R- squared values as well as those within 0.1 range of 
the best R- squared value. Borderline cases were resolved through visual inspection. 
For all ion traces of the remaining reactants, data from the two experimental and 
two technical replicates were lumped together, and mean and SD were calculated 
for each timepoint. Then bootstrapping was performed by resampling the mean of 
each timepoint 200 times based on their calculated SD assuming standard normal 
distribution. After each resampling, a least- squares fit with our fitting model based 
on Haldane kinetics (see below) was performed on the resampled timepoints, the 
resulting fit was scaled between 0 (start) and 1 (equilibrium), and its area under the 
curve (AUC) was calculated. Fits with an R- squared value below 0.7 were omitted 
from further analysis, and if 50% or more of the fits for a given assay were of poor 
quality, the assay was considered inconclusive. Remaining AUCs were translated 
to estimated changes in enzymatic activity by performing a least- squares fit with 
our fitting model based on Haldane kinetics to the overlaid progress curves of all 
control assays of an enzyme, i.e. all assays without added effectors. The resulting 
set of optimal parameters was fixed while varying the kcat parameter to simulate 
new progress curves. These simulated progress curves functioned similarly to a 
calibration curve, establishing a relationship between changes in k cat and their 
corresponding AUCs. This relationship was used to translate the progress curve 
areas in assays with effectors into estimates of enzymatic activity changes. For each 
enzyme–effector combination, the translated AUCs from all eligible reactants were 
pooled together to form a population. The final score was derived as the log2- fold 
activity change at the first quartile of this population. This ensured that 75% of the 
data points showed equal or greater activity changes, providing a relatively robust 
summary of effector influence that minimizes the impact of outliers or extreme 
10 of 11   https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2423767122 pnas.org
values. Other metrics based on population percentages were obtained in a similar 
manner, e.g. 95% CI used for scoring (SI Appendix, Fig. S3) correspond to 97.5% of 
data points showing equal or greater activity changes. Accordingly, 95% CI for visual 
representation of the bootstrapping approach (Figs. 1C and 3B) were calculated by 
sorting the AUCs from each bootstrapping fit and selecting the interval between 
the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles. Note that the fitting of controls and translation of 
effector AUCs were performed separately for each measurement batch of an enzyme, 
with controls from units 1 to 4 used to translate effectors in those units, and controls 
from units 5 to 8 used similarly.
Validation Experiments: Spectrophotometric Enzyme Activity Assays.  
Spectrophotometric assays were performed on four dehydrogenases (Gnd, Icd, 
MaeA, MaeB) measuring NADH or NADPH production via changes in absorbance 
at 340 nm. The experimental design and analysis followed the mass spectrometry 
approach with modifications to accommodate the photometric method. Assays 
were conducted in a 96- well format at 37 °C. Instead of a discontinuous sampling 
and quenching approach, photometric assays were performed continuously in 
three experimental replicates. 100 mM instead of 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.5) were 
used in the buffer. Absorbance at timepoint zero was measured by adding 180 
µL of enzyme buffer to each well, followed by an absorption measurement. Then, 
20 μL of enzyme were added and the plate was immediately transferred to the 
photometer preheated to 37 °C, while recording the time between the initiation 
of the reaction and the start of measurement. A least- squares fit with our fitting 
model based on Haldane kinetics was performed on each of the three replicates. 
The fit was scaled between 0 and 1, and AUC was calculated. Estimated activity 
changes were derived from the AUCs by fitting control assays and simulating 
changes in kcat, similar to the MS method. For each enzyme–effector combination, 
the first quartile was calculated as μ − 0.675σ, where μ represents the mean and 
σ the SD of the three replicates.
Functions Used for Fitting Enzymatic Progress Curves.  The function used 
to fit the time- dependent trajectory of accumulation of reaction products, P(t), 
is based on the analytical solution to the ordinary differential equation system 
where the rate of the reaction is described by Haldane’s rate law, sometimes 
referred to as reversible Michaelis–Menten rate law. The solution for a reaction 
with one substrate and one product is
P(t) = P(∞)⋅
/bracketleft.s4
1 −
W 0
/parenleft.s1/u1D714e/u1D714e−/u1D6FDt/parenright.s1
W 0 (/u1D714e/u1D714)
/bracketright.s4
,
where W0 is the zeroth branch of the Lambert W function (i.e. the inverse func-
tion of ωeω) and P(∞) corresponds to the final equilibrium concentration of the 
product. We replaced physical parameters with effective ones used for fitting the 
function, namely ω ← P(∞)/K*M and β ← Ek*cat /K*M.
In the case of reactions with two substrates, in order to get an analytical solu-
tion, we assume that both substrates start with the same initial concentration, 
and that their binding to the enzyme follow an idealized binding mechanism, 
where there is no enzyme–substrate complex with a single substrate but instead 
both substrates simultaneously bind to the enzyme. In this case, the solution 
will be
P (t) = P (∞) ⋅

,
As in the case of one substrate, P(∞) corresponds to the final equilibrium 
concentration of the product. ω and β are the fitting parameters.
