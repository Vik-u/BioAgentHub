ABSTRACT
Plant organisms assimilate CO
2 
through the photosynthetic pathway, which facilitates in the synthesis of 
sugar for plant development. As environmental elements including water level, CO
2 
concentration, 
temperature and soil characteristics change, the plants may recruit series of genes to help adapt the 
hostile environments and challenges. C4 photosynthesis plants are an excellent example of plant evolu -
tionary adaptation to diverse condition. Compared with C3 photosynthesis plants, C4 photosynthesis 
plants have altered leaf anatomy and new metabolism for CO
2 
capture, with multiple related enzymes 
such as phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPCase), pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK), NAD(P)- 
malic enzyme (NAD(P)-ME), NAD(P) – malate dehydrogenase (NAD(P)-MDH) and carbonic anhydrases (CA), 
identified to participate in the carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM) pathway. Recently, great achieve -
ments about C4 CCM-related genes have been made in the dissection of C3 plant development processes 
involving various stresses. In this review, we describe the functions of C4 CCM-related homologous genes 
in carbon and nitrogen metabolism in C3 plants. We further summarize C4 CCM-related homologous 
genes’ functions in response to stresses in C3 plants. The understanding of C4 CCM-related genes’ 
function in response to abiotic stress in plant is important to modify the crop plants for climate 
diversification.

Background
In C3 photosynthesis, the C3 cycle occurs mainly in mesophyll 
cells, where carbon dioxide is fixed by Rubisco and then enters 
into the Calvin cycle. Subsequently, carbohydrates are pro -
duced by going through a series of enzymatic chemical 
reactions.
1 
In contrast to C3 photosynthesis, C4 photosynthesis 
takes place in mesophyll (M) and bundle sheath (BS) cells in 
various steps.
2 , 3 
The distinctions between the biochemical C3 
and C4 cycles are associated with (1) the location of photo -
synthesis occurrence and (2) the mechanism of CO
2 
concentration.
4–6
The majority of plants performed C3 photosynthesis to 
synthesize carbon-hydration for life activities, and this process 
relies on the passive diffusion of CO
2 
from the atmosphere to 
sites of carboxylation by ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxy -
lase/oxygenase (Rubisco) in chloroplasts.
6 
Compared to C3 
photosynthesis reaction, C4 pathway acts carbon concentrating 
mechanism (CCM) by three key steps: (1) the initial fixation of 
CO
2 
by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) to form a C4 
acid, (2) decarboxylation of a C4 acid to release CO
2 
near the 
site of the Calvin cycle, and (3) regeneration of the primary 
CO
2 
acceptor phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) by pyruvate, ortho -
phosphate dikinase (PPDK), which results C4 plant achieve 
high photosynthetic capacity and higher water and nitrogen 
use efficiencies.
2 , 5
In recent years, there has been widespread interest in the 
evolutionary diversification of C4 plants. As a convergent phe -
nomenon, C4 photosynthesis is an excellent model for complex 
trait evolution in response to environmental change. 
Compared to C3 leaf anatomy, the C4 plants have two impor -
tant characteristics, Kranz anatomy and less cell number 
between vascular bundle/tissue.
6 , 7 
In most C4 plants, Kranz 
anatomy, which is composed of developed vascular bundle 
sheath cells and mesophyll cells arranged concentrically 
around the veins, is rich in chloroplast and proceeds 
photosynthesis.
8 
C4 plants have higher vein densities which 
cause the M:BS ratio to be reduced. This allows for greater 
M-BS contact which facilitates metabolites moving between 
cells.
7 
In another word, the M/BS (mesophyll cells/bundle 
sheath cells) ratio of all C4 species is generally low, which 
reduces the path length and ensures rapid cell-to-cell diffusion 
of C4 metabolites.
9 
As a consequence, C4 plants are more 
efficient than C3 plants in photosynthetic product transport 
and water distribution.
10–12
In the Oligocene, it was found that the concentration of 
carbon dioxide gradually decreased, and then reached to mod -
ern level by the late Oligocene.
13 
As the CO
2 
concentration 
reduced, concentration of O
2 
increased, temperatures rise and 
other environmental elements changed that led plants to 
recruit series of genes, which enhanced their ability to resist 
hostile environments by forming some specific mechanisms 
and structures for survival. Under low CO
2 
concentration, 
photorespiration enhanced. This likely promoted C4 photo -
synthesis to evolve.
14 
It is reported that over millions of years, 
there have been over 60 independent origin events of C4 
photosynthesis to enhance their ability to resist hostile envir -
onments by forming some specific mechanisms and structures 
for increasing in energy-costly photorespiration.

adaptive evolution, C4 plants leaves form a special Kranz 
structure that reduces the distance between the veins, C4 
photosynthesis concentrates CO
2 
around the carboxylating 
enzyme Rubisco by means of PEPCase or other enzymes,
7 , 17
Earlier research on tissue structure difference between C3 
and C4 plants and the fixing of carbon dioxide during the 
process of photosynthesis has aroused great interest. Various 
researches indicate that such factors are key points for studying 
the evolution of C4 plants to improve the photosynthetic 
product accumulation rate.
4 , 6 , 7 , 17 , 18 
It is well known that 
Rubisco does not only catalyze CO
2 
fixation but also partici -
pates in an oxygenase reaction called photorespiration, leading 
to a reduction in the efficiency of photosynthetic CO
2 
assimilation.
19 
The current research found that the main key 
enzymes of the C4 pathway include phosphoenolpyruvate car -
boxylase (PEPCase), pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase 
(PPDK), which depends on NAD(P) malic enzyme (NAD(P)- 
ME), dependent on NAD(P) malate dehydrogenase (NAD(P)- 
MDH) and carbonic anhydrase (CA).
20 , 21 
Thus, the structure 
and enzymatic activities of evolved C4 plants enhance their 
photosynthesis ability and improve photosynthetic substance 
transport. Compared to C3 plants, C4 photosynthetic enzymes 
were identified to be important in the resistance of a variety of 
stresses.
Function of C4 photosynthetic key genes under 
abiotic stresses
Carbonic anhydrases (CAs)
Carbonic anhydrases (CAs), a type of zinc metal enzymes, play 
essential roles in the conversion of HCO
3
− 
to CO
2 
in all 
photosynthetic organisms.
20 
In C4 plant mesophyll, the 
enzyme converts atmospheric CO
2 
to bicarbonate, which is 
then used to carboxylate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) by the 
primary carboxylase of C4 plants, PEP carboxylase (PEPC). 
This reaction initiates the C4 acid transfer cycle that is integral 
to the carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM) of C4 plants, 
and leads to CO
2 
concentrations.
22 
Plants have three types of 
CA: α-, β-, and γ-types involved in CO
2 
uptake, fixation or 
recycling.
23 
The α-type CA is first found in erythrocytes,
24 , 25 
whereas the β-type and the γ-type CA were first discovered in 
plant and archaea, respectively.
26 , 27 
Some studies have sug -
gested that the main function of carbonic anhydrase may not 
be to catalyze the mutual conversion of CO
2 
and HCO
3
−
, but to 
use this transformation to maintain the required pH level in 
each compartment of the cell in an animal system.
28 
Then, it 
can maintain the stability of the intracellular metabolic system. 
There is a study demonstrating that CAs play a role in the CO
2 
signaling pathway in C3 plants, which regulated the gas- 
exchange between plants and the atmosphere. In the process 
of studying Arabidopsis mutant plants in the β-carbonic anhy -
drases, Hu et al. discovered β-CA functioned in guard cells and 
mediates CO
2 
regulation of stomatal movements.
29 
In leaf 
mesophyll cells of C4 plants, a cytosolic β-CA catalyzes the 
first step in C4 photosynthesis. β-CAs are involved in CO
2 
sensing pathway within guard cells and are important in sto -
matal development. A reaserch of carbonic anhydrase mutants 
in Zea mays displays that CA is connected with stomatal 
movement in response to CO
2 
and light.
30 
In addition, studies 
have demonstrated a number of roles attributed to β-CAs 
found in leaf mesophyll cells, including involvement in refixa -
tion of respiratory CO
2
, stress responses, amino acid and lipid 
biosynthesis, photosystem II activity, and seedling 
establishment.
20 
Salinity induces an increase in bCA transcript 
abundance in a maize C4 plant.
31 
It has similar roles in C3 
plant as compared with C4 plant. The CAs in Arabidopsis and 
tobacco have been identified as binding proteins of salicylic 
acid, which function in an antioxidant role during viral 
infections.
32 , 33 
Carbonic anhydrases CA1 and CA4 function 
in atmospheric CO
2
-modulated disease resistance.
34 
AtCA1 
contributes to a negative feedback loop that modulates the 
plant defense response, which involves in vivo interaction 
between Turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) HCPro and the 
Arabidopsis homologue of SABP3.
35 
Cytoplasmic CA2 plays 
an important role in amino acid biosynthesis and plant growth 
at low CO
2 
in Arabidopsis.
36 
CA2 over-expressing transgenic 
plants function in ROS inhibits H
2
O
2 
dependent lignin poly -
merization, and then caused male sterility.
37 
Under the resis -
tance to the Plutella xylostella , AtbCA1 and AtbCA4 protein 
contents are increased at least a twofold in recombinant lines of 
Arabidopsis.
38 
Heterologous expression of the rice CA in 
Arabidopsis leads to enhanced growth on salt medium.
39 
Both salinity and an osmotic stress treatment using polyethy -
lene glycol resulted in an increase in rice seedling total CA 
enzyme activity, and the level of mRNA coding for a predicted 
chloroplastic CA isoform.
39
Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPCase)
Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase is a crucial enzyme that 
functions in catalyzing phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) and bicar -
bonate to form oxaloacetic acid (OAA).
6 
PEPC is found in all 
plants, green algae, and cyanobacteria, and in most archaea and 
nonphotosynthetic bacteria, but not in animals or fungi.
40 , 41 
There are four types of PEPC genes in C4 plants: C4 type (green 
leaf type), root (stem) type, yellow leaf type or C3 type, and 
bacterial isoform.
42 
Unexpectedly, there are two classes of 
PEPC in castor oil seeds: class-1 is composed of 107-kDa plant- 
type PEPC subunits, the other one is formed by the combina -
tion of class-1 PEPC and 118-kDa bacterial-type PEPC 
subunits.
43 , 44 
Moreover, early studies also have mentioned 
that PEPCase is probably the most important supplementary 
product of the citric acid cycle, in addition to the well-known 
function of fixing CO
2 
in the C4 cycle.
45 
In the C4 photosyn -
thetic pathway, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase is one of the 
rate-limiting enzymes. It is mainly located in the cytoplasm of 
C4 plant mesophyll cells. The mutants PEPC targeted the 
cytosolic photosynthetic in Setaria viridis , which keep very 
low PEPC activities, g row more slowly than the wild type. 
Furthermore, the result reveals that the cell wall thickness of 
mutant leaf reduces and plasmodesmata (PD) density increases 
at the mesophyll-bundle sheath (M-BS) cell interface.
46 
Other 
reports also indicate that this enzyme also acts on the regula -
tion of stomatal function, assimilation of nitrogen, stability of 
pH value and refixation of CO
2
.
47 
In addition to participating 
in photosynthesis, PEPC also has a variety of physiological 
functions, including promoting seed germination and

formation, regulating guard cells, promoting malate synthesis, 
providing a respiratory substrate for nitrogen-fixing rhizobia, 
and playing an important role in plant resistance to abiotic 
stress.
41 , 48–50 
PEPC genes have been cloned from plants such as 
Flaveria, Zea mays, Glycine max (Linn.) Merr., Solanum tuber -
osum L., Oryza sativa, Sorghum bicolor , etc. PEPC plays 
a crucial role in modulating the balance of carbon and nitrogen 
metabolism in Arabidopsis leaves.
51 
Bacterial-type PEPC gene 
fragment concluded that PEPC may function as a metabolic 
pivot in the regulation of protein and lipid accumulation in 
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.
52
Under drought stress, the photosynthetic rate of transgenic 
rice with PEPC gene is significantly higher. As a result, the 
malic acid content increased and stomatal conductance 
increased, implicating a strong photosynthetic capacity.
53 
C4 
PEPC genes in C4 plant has stronger adaptability under high 
temperatures, particularly at low concentration of CO
2
.
54 , 55 
Transgenic rice plants over-expressing maize C4- pepc gene 
encoding phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase had higher survi -
val and net photosynthetic rates after 16 d of drought treat -
ment, with higher relative water content in leaves after 2 h of 
drought treatment.
56 
ZmPEPC gene can enhance photochemi -
cal and antioxidant enzyme activity, up-regulate the expression 
of photosynthesis-related genes, delay degradation of chloro -
phyll, change contents of proline and other metabolites in 
wheat, and ultimately improve its heat tolerance.
57 
OsPEPC4 
expression reduced line inhibits the assimilation of ammo -
nium, subsequent amino acid synthesis and reduces the level 
of organic acids. The results show that PEPC plays a key role in 
the process of ammonium assimilation, which contributes to 
the growth of rice under NH
4 
+ 
stress.
58 
Many studies have 
shown that C4 type pepc genes can improve photosynthetic 
efficiency and yield potential, when transfered into C3 crops. 
Heterologous expression of the maize C4-PEPC in rice 
enhance photorespiratory under low-N levels,
59 
and high 
maize C4-PEPC transcript levels and activity promote drought 
tolerance in rice by inducing proline accumulation, enhance 
photosynthesis, and increase dry weight.
56
Pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase, PPDK
PPDK mainly occurs in two sub-chambers, chloroplastic 
(ChlPPDK) and cytosolic PPDKK (cyPPDKZm1 and 
cyPPDKZm2), which catalyzes the Pi and ATP-dependent 
regeneration of PEP from pyruvate and promotes CO
2 
fixation 
in the C4 pathway.
60 
The chlPPDK is expressed at high levels in 
the mesophyll cells,
61 
and plays a vital role in C4 photosynth -
esis, also called C4 PPDK.
62 
Interestingly, ChlPPDK and 
cyPPDKZm1 in maize are encoded by the same gene controlled 
by dual promoters with different size of mRNA. At present, the 
PPDK gene has been cloned from some common plants, such 
as Zea mays, Oryza sativa, Arabidopsis thaliana, Echinochloa 
crusgalli , etc. Same case also exists in C3 Arabidopsis and rice 
suggesting the gene for chloroplast targeting of PPDK origi -
nated before the divergence of C4 plants from their C3 ances -
tors, as well as between monocots and dicots.
63 , 64 
cyPPDKZm1 
and cyPPDKZm2 genes expression level are low in most maize 
tissues including the root, stem and leaf, but greatly induced in 
developing seeds.
65–67 
PPDK plays a critical role in the balance 
between carbon and nitrogen through inorganic pyropho -
sphate-dependent restriction of ADP-glucose synthesis during 
endosperm development.
66–68 
The study of a ppdk mutant of 
maize established that the loss of function of this gene caused 
plant seedlings to die. Also, the sugar signal and nitrogen 
metabolism of the mutants experienced serious changes, with -
out changes in the anatomical structure of the Kranz.
21 
Arabidopsis PPDK mediates nitrogen remobilization and pro -
motes seed size and seed nitrogen content.
69 
In addition, there 
are other research results indicating that PPDK enzyme has the 
ability to mediate the transport of nitrogen from leaves to seeds 
during the aging process of Arabidopsis, which in turn affects 
the growth and nitrogen content of seeds.
64 
Rice cytoplasmic 
PPDK is essential for grain filling, with reduced starch, but 
increased fat content in the grains.
63 
PPDK also plays an 
important role when plants face abiotic stresses such as low 
temperature, drought, and salt stress. PPDK mediated excep -
tional cold tolerance of carbon assimilation in Miscanthus × 
giganteus .
35 
Transgenic rice can significantly reduce the 
damage caused by drought stress to plant cells, when trans -
genic PEPC + PPDK double-gene rice was drought treated. 
Whilst at the same time, the photosynthetic rate and water use 
efficiency are increased. During this process, the leaf PPDK 
enzyme activity value and the rate of increase are significantly 
different from the wild type.
70
NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME) and NAD-malic enzyme 
(NAD-ME)
NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME) and NAD-malic enzyme 
are other key enzymes of malate metabolism. The primary 
function of NADP-ME and NAD-ME is to release CO
2 
from 
malate, where the CO
2 
released can be refixed by ribulose-1, 
5-diphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). This process 
is regulated by light and therefore closely related to 
photosynthesis.
71 
NADP-ME and NAD-ME are two different 
biochemical subtypes. In NAD-ME plants, aspartate is used as 
the transport metabolite and malate produced after deamina -
tion and reduction, is decarboxylated by NAD-ME in the 
bundle sheath mitochondria. Whereas in NADP-ME plants, 
malate is the dominant transport metabolite.
5 
NADP-ME is 
more efficient under low light conditions, while NAD-ME 
species have a better photo-adaptive ability. This is seen 
through the uses of three biochemical subtypes (NADP malic 
enzyme (NADP-ME), NAD malic enzyme (NAD-ME) and 
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEP-CK)) of C4 plants 
as materials, and comparing these plants photosynthetic char -
acteristics under low and high light. In an environment with 
insufficient light, NADP-ME can better help plant growth.
72 
At 
present, cDNAs of C4 type NADP-ME genes have been cloned 
in maize, sorghum, and Flaveria . NADP-ME is present in the 
chloroplasts and mitochondria of C4 plant cells. Besides photo -
synthesis, it participates in a variety of biological processes, 
including fatty acid synthesis, cytoplasmic pH regulation, and 
plant defense. The pyruvate produced by the NADP-ME reac -
tion is involved in the synthesis of defensive compounds such 
as lignin and flavones. Furthermore, NADPH is essential for 
the stability of the reactive oxygen metabolism system. 
Therefore, NADP-ME acts on the response of various plants 
PLANT SIGNALING & BEHAVIOR
 e2115634-3
to stress, such as biological stress, drought stress, salt stress, 
heavy metals, etc.
73 
Some experiments have found that the level 
of expression of malic enzyme gene ( OsNAD-ME1 , Gene ID: 
4343294) in rice changes under salt, alkali, drought, oxidation 
and other stresses, which indicates that malic enzyme can 
respond to abiotic stress.
53 
When Hasan et al. studied the 
NAD-malic enzyme in mesophyll (M) and bundle sheath 
(BS) cells of Amaranthus cruentus L, they demonstrated that 
a new subtype of NAD-ME (~121 kDa) was formed in the 
mitochondria of BS cell types, whereas the NAD-ME enzyme 
activity was noticed to enhance, the subtype disappears after 
resuming watering under drought conditions. This enzyme 
contributes to the adaptability of plants in extreme environ -
mental factors.
14 
Additionally, NAD(P)-ME participates in 
photosynthetic pathway of C4 plants. The carbon dioxide 
generated by its catalytic decarboxylation reaction, is refixed 
by Rubisco enzyme and enters the Calvin cycle. There is thus, 
the potential of breeding high-yield C3 plants with improve 
photosynthetic rate via cloning and transferring the C4 plant 
NAD ( NADP ) -ME gene into C3 crops.
NAD(P) – malate dehydrogenase
Malate dehydrogenase (MDH) is divided into two types, NAD- 
dependent and NADP-dependent, whose basic function is to 
catalyze the biochemical reaction of malic acid and oxaloace -
tate conversion. MDH is widely distributed in organs including 
glyoxylates, mitochondria, peroxides, chloroplasts, and 
cytoplasm.
74 
In plants, it participates in metabolic processes 
such as C4 cycle, TCA cycle and photosynthesis. Plant MDH is 
mainly involved in the synthesis and degradation of malic acid, 
and plays an important role in the cytoplasm and organelle 
shuttle system: the malate shuttle system closely links different 
organelle MDHs.
75 
In addition, MDH has also been demon -
strated to play an important role in plant response to abiotic 
stress. Under heavy metal stress conditions, malate dehydro -
genase (MDH) in plants catalyzes the conversion of a large 
amount of oxaloacetate to malate, increasing the malate con -
tent. Studies have shown that organic acids such as malic acid 
can be combined with heavy metals and converted into 
a nontoxic or less toxic binding state, thereby reducing the 
toxic effects of heavy metals on plants.
76 , 77 
Studies have sug -
gested that overexpression of MDH gene enhances salt toler -
ance in plants: malate content increases when plasmid 
ZmNADP-MDH gene is overexpressed in Arabidopsis thaliana . 
And malate salt, which undergoes a series of reactions in the 
chloroplast and generates through TCA cycle, could promote 
the increasing of proline synthesis. Consequently, high levels of 
proline are able to protect plants from salt stress.
78 
The 
mMDH2 gene negatively regulates cadmium (Cd) tolerance 
by modulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels and the 
ROS-mediated signaling, thus, affecting the expression of 
PDR8.
79 
Loss function of OsMDH mutant exhibits a salt stress 
tolerance phenotype by regulating vitamin B6 content.

Conclusion
C4 plants that evolve from C3 plants are more resistant to unfa -
vorable factors, such as drought, salinity, high temperature, strong 
light, and so on, among which C4 genes play an important role 
( Figure 1 ). Therefore, research on the C4 genes is of great sig -
nificance as humans are faced with challenges that threaten food 
security such as the increase in global population, decrease in the 
area of arable land, global warming, frequent extreme weather, 
and land desertification. In recent years, someone proposed the 
C4 rice project,
18 
which is to introduce C4 photosynthetic path -
ways into C3 plant rice, although the results show that based on 
the existing veins, the introduction of a small amount of C4 
photosynthesis may already be beneficial to the photosynthesis 
of C4 rice, there are still many problems to be solved. In order to 
explore the key enzyme functions of the C4 pathway in depth, 
researchers transferred it into C3 plants for research. 
81
,transferred 
the maize NADP-ME gene into rice. The research results found 
that the expression of NADP-ME gene increased in transgenic 
rice under drought conditions. And the plant’s stomatal conduc -
tance decreases, so it has the ability to retain water and drought 
resistance.
81 
Under drought stress, the photosynthetic rate advan -
tage of PEPC gene transgenic rice is significant, and it is found 
that its malic acid content rises, the stomatal conductance is 
higher, and it has a strong photosynthetic capacity.
53
Current studies have shown that the role of C4 key enzyme 
gene in plant response to adversity is a complex process in 
many aspects, especially in drought stress and salt stress. 
However, some studies have found that it has a significant 
role in plant response to heavy metal stress, such as cadmium 
and aluminum. It is not clear. Soil heavy metal pollution has 
been caused to different degrees, causing plant toxicity, which 
is caused by the use of organic fertilizers, chemical fertilizers, 
pesticides, and the discharge of various industrial sewage. An 
in-depth study of the function of C4 key enzyme gene in 
response to abiotic stress and its mechanism of action may 
provide new insights for the study of plant stress tolerance.
