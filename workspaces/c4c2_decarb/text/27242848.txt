Photosynthesis

Organic acids are involved in numerous metabolic pathways in all plants. The ﬁnding
that some plants, known as C 4 plants, have four-carbon dicarboxylic acids as the
ﬁrst product of carbon ﬁxation showed these organic acids play essential roles as
photosynthetic intermediates. Oxaloacetate (OAA), malate, and aspartate (Asp) are
substrates for the C 4 acid cycle that underpins the CO 2 concentrating mechanism of
C4 photosynthesis. In this cycle, OAA is the immediate, short-lived, product of the initial
CO2 ﬁxation step in C4 leaf mesophyll cells. The malate and Asp, resulting from the rapid
conversion of OAA, are the organic acids delivered to the sites of carbon reduction in
the bundle-sheath cells of the leaf, where they are decarboxylated, with the released
CO2 used to make carbohydrates. The three-carbon organic acids resulting from the
decarboxylation reactions are returned to the mesophyll cells where they are used
to regenerate the CO 2 acceptor pool. NADP-malic enzyme-type, NAD-malic enzyme-
type, and phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase-type C 4 plants were identiﬁed, based
on the most abundant decarboxylating enzyme in the leaf tissue. The genes encoding
these C4 pathway-associated decarboxylases were co-opted from ancestral C 3 plant
genes during the evolution of C 4 photosynthesis. Malate was recognized as the major
organic acid transferred in NADP-malic enzyme-type C 4 species, while Asp ﬁlls this
role in NAD-malic enzyme-type and phosphoenol pyruvate carboxykinase-type plants.
However, accumulating evidence indicates that many C 4 plants use a combination of
organic acids and decarboxylases during CO 2 ﬁxation, and the C 4-type categories
are not rigid. The ability to transfer multiple organic acid species and utilize different
decarboxylases has been suggested to give C 4 plants advantages in changing and
stressful environments, as well as during development, by facilitating the balance of
energy between the two cell types involved in the C4 pathway of CO2 assimilation. The
results of recent empirical and modeling studies support this suggestion and indicate
that a combination of transferred organic acids and decarboxylases is beneﬁcial to C 4
plants in different light environments.

INTRODUCTION
Organic acids are of fundamental importance in all plant species. They are involved in many and
diverse metabolic pathways, including energy production, carbon storage, stomatal conductance,
the biosynthesis of amino acids, plant–microbe interactions, and mechanisms allowing plants to
deal with excess cations, changing osmotic conditions, and soils low in nutrients as well as those

with high metal content (reviewed in López-Bucio et al., 2000).
In addition to these varied roles, organic acids play a major
part in the C 4 photosynthetic pathway as the intermediates
connecting CO2 uptake and ﬁxation, and this is the focus of this
review.
Work on sugarcane published in the 1960s (Burr, 1962;
Kortschak et al., 1965; Hatch and Slack, 1966; Hatch et al., 1967)
showed that this plant performed a diﬀerent type of CO2 ﬁxation
biochemistry compared to the photosynthetic carbon reduction
(PCR) cycle determined in the Calvin laboratory (Bassham and
Calvin, 1957). 14CO2 labeling studies indicated the ﬁrst major
products of CO 2 assimilation in sugarcane were the 4-carbon
(C) organic acids malate and aspartate (Asp) rather than 3-
phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) or other intermediates of the PCR
cycle (Burr, 1962; Kortschak et al., 1965; Hatch and Slack, 1966;
Hatch et al., 1967). Hatch and Slack (1966) described a model
of the pathway, which encompassed and extended the earlier
work. The pathway is now known as the C 4 pathway because
of the initial ﬁxation products, and plants using the pathway
are known as C 4 plants. This seminal work (Hatch and Slack,
1966) also resolved that the fourth C of oxaloacetate (OAA) was
labeled along with those of malate and Asp. However, OAA was
short-lived, and immediately converted to malate or Asp. The
label in these dicarboxylic acids was transferred to the ﬁrst C
of 3-PGA, which then was used for carbohydrate synthesis via
the PCR cycle. Their model also included a 3-C organic acid as
the acceptor molecule for atmospheric CO 2 (Hatch and Slack,
1966).
A generalized scheme of the reactions making up the C 4
photosynthetic pathway is shown in Figure 1. Unlike C 3 plants,
most C 4 species use two cell types in CO 2 assimilation: the
mesophyll (M) and bundle-sheath (BS) cells. The BS cells
surround the vascular tissue, and are in turn surrounded by
M cells, giving the characteristic wreath-like or Kranz anatomy
that was ﬁrst describe in the late 19th century (Haberlandt,
1896). In C 4 leaves, no M cell is more than two cells away
from a BS cell, which facilitates rapid metabolite exchange
between the two cell types. Atmospheric CO 2 entering a
C4 leaf is hydrated to bicarbonate in the M cytosol by
carbonic anhydrase (CA). The primary carboxylase of C 4 plants,
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), uses the bicarbonate
to ﬁx a CO 2 group to the 3-C compound phospho enolpyruvate
(PEP), producing OAA, which is rapidly converted to malate
and/or Asp. These dicarboxylic acids move into the neighboring
BS where they are decarboxylated, with the released CO 2
being used for carbohydrate production by the PCR cycle,
located in BS cell chloroplasts. The 3-C organic acids released
in the decarboxylation reactions return to a neighboring M
cell, where they can be used as the CO 2 acceptor by PEPC
(Figure 1).
An important outcome of the C 4 acid cycle is the
concentration of CO 2 around ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate
carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) in the BS to levels at least
10-times higher than those of the surrounding atmosphere
(Jenkins et al., 1989). This results in C 4 plants requiring less
Rubisco for carbohydrate production than C 3 species, which
translates into increased nitrogen-use eﬃciency (Ghannoum
FIGURE 1 | A diagram outlining a generalized C4 photosynthetic
pathway. Atmospheric CO2 enters a mesophyll (M) cell of a leaf and is
converted to bicarbonate (HCO3−) by carbonic anhydrase (CA). The
bicarbonate is then used to carboxylate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) by PEP
carboxylase (PEPC), producing oxaloacetate (OAA), which is immediately
converted into another four-carbon (C) organic acid that is transferred to
bundle-sheath (BS) cells. Decarboxylation of the 4-C acid occurs in BS cells,
releasing CO2, which is ﬁxed into carbohydrates by the photosynthetic carbon
reduction (PCR) cycle in the chloroplast (green oval). The 3-C organic acid
released at the decarboxylation step, is transferred to M cells, where it
contributes to the CO2 acceptor pool. Note the 3-C and 4-C organic acids
formed, and the intracellular location of the decarboxylation reactions vary,
depending on the C4 subtype (see Figures 2–4).
et al., 2011). In contrast to Rubisco, which can ﬁx oxygen in
addition to CO 2, leading to photorespiration and the loss of
ﬁxed CO2 and consumption of ATP , PEPC has only carboxylase
activity. Consequently C 4 plants have little photorespiratory
activity, and through a combination of PEPC kinetics and leaf
anatomy, also show increased water-use eﬃciency compared to
C3 plants (Ghannoum et al., 2011).
As more C 4 plants were examined, it became clear that
while the ﬁrst two steps in the pathway, those catalyzed by

Ludwig Organic Acids in C4 Photosynthesis
CA and PEPC, are the same in all species (Hatch, 1987;
Kanai and Edwards, 1999), diﬀerences exist in the 4-C organic
acid transferred to the BS; the decarboxylating enzymes and
their activities and intracellular locations; the 3-C organic acid
returned to the M cells; and regeneration of the CO 2 acceptor.
As a result, three subtypes of C 4 photosynthesis were recognized
(Gutierrez et al., 1974; Hatch et al., 1975; Hatch, 1987; Kanai and
Edwards, 1999), based on the decarboxylating enzyme with the
greatest activity in the leaf tissue, and C4 species were categorized
into one of these subtypes: NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME),
NAD-malic enzyme (NAD-ME), or PEP carboxykinase (PCK).
This review will summarize the three C 4 subtypes, focusing
on the organic acids utilized in the course of CO 2 ﬁxation,
and the enzymes responsible for their metabolism. The roles
of the 4-C organic acid decarboxylases in C 3 plants will be
presented along with the current understanding of their co-
option into C 4 biochemistry. Consideration will then be given
to evidence suggesting that C 4 plants are more ﬂexible with
respect to the types of organic acids and decarboxylases used
than previously thought, and the apparent advantages this
plasticity gives the plants in ﬂuctuating environments will be
discussed.
C4 PHOTOSYNTHETIC SUBTYPES
NADP-ME-Subtype
Malate is the major 4-C organic acid transferred to the BS in
C4 species designated as belonging to the NADP-ME subtype
(Figure 2 ). The OAA synthesized from PEPC activity in the
cytoplasm of M cells is transferred to the chloroplast and reduced
to malate by NADP-malate dehydrogenase (NADP-MDH). The
malate is then transported out of the M chloroplasts, diﬀuses into
the BS, and in the BS chloroplasts is decarboxylated by NADP-
ME in a reaction producing NADPH, CO 2, and pyruvate. The
released CO 2 is ﬁxed by Rubisco in the BS chloroplasts, while
the pyruvate is transported out of the BS chloroplasts, and into
the chloroplasts of M cells, where it is used to regenerate PEP by
pyruvate Pi dikinase (PPDK).
The NADP-ME subtype is the most prevalent C 4 subtype,
and is found in both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous
species (Gutierrez et al., 1974; Sage et al., 2011). Agronomically
important monocots such as maize, sorghum, and sugarcane
are categorized as NADP-ME species. C 4 species of Flaveria,
a dicotyledonous genus that has been used to examine the
evolution of C4 photosynthesis for more than 25 years, also show
high levels of malate production during CO 2 ﬁxation, as well as
high activity of NADP-ME in leaf tissue.
NAD-ME-Subtype
C4 plants using NAD-ME as their primary decarboxylase include
Atriplex, and C 4 species of Cleome and Amaranthus (Gutierrez
et al., 1974; Sage et al., 2011). Some C 4 species of Panicum also
have high NAD-ME activity in BS mitochondria.
Aspartate is the ﬁrst stable organic acid of this C 4 subtype,
and results from the transamination of OAA by an Asp
aminotransferase (AST) located in the cytosol of M cells
FIGURE 2 | Schematic of the C4 NADP-malic enzyme-subtype
pathway. In mesophyll (M) cells of this C4 subtype, the bicarbonate (HCO3−)
produced from atmospheric CO2 by CA is used to carboxylate
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEP) by PEPC. The OAA formed is
reduced to malate in M chloroplasts (green oval), by NADP-malate
dehydrogenase (NADP-MDH), and then diffuses into BS cells, where it is
decarboxylated in the chloroplast by NADP-malic enzyme (NADP-ME). The
CO2 released is used to make carbohydrates by the PCR cycle, while the
pyruvate diffuses to the M where it is converted to PEP by pyruvate Pi
dikinase (PPDK).
(Figure 3). The Asp enters the mitochondria of BS cells where
it is converted back to OAA by a mitochondrial isoform
of AST, and through the activity of a mitochondrial NAD-
malate dehydrogenase (NAD-MDH), the OAA is reduced to
malate. NAD-ME is also active in the BS mitochondria, and
catalyzes the release of CO 2 from malate, along with the
reduction of NAD +. The CO 2 diﬀuses into the chloroplasts
of the BS, and is ﬁxed by Rubisco. The pyruvate, resulting
from the decarboxylation reaction, is transported out of the
mitochondria, and transaminated to Ala by a cytosolic Ala
aminotransferase (ALT). The Ala diﬀuses into a neighboring

Ludwig Organic Acids in C4 Photosynthesis
FIGURE 3 | A diagram showing the steps in the C4 NAD-malic
enzyme-subtype pathway. In mesophyll (M) cells, PEP is carboxylated by
PEPC using the CO2 group from bicarbonate (HCO3−), which was produced
from the hydration of atmospheric CO2 by CA. The resulting OAA is
transaminated to Asp by Asp aminotransferase (AST). In the mitochondria
(blue oval) of BS cells, OAA is generated from Asp by a mitochondrial AST,
and then reduced to malate by NAD-malate dehydrogenase (NAD-MDH).
Malate is decarboxylated by NAD-malic enzyme (NAD-ME), and the released
CO2 diffuses into the BS chloroplast (green oval), where it is ﬁxed by the PCR
cycle. The pyruvate resulting from the decarboxylation reaction is converted to
alanine (Ala) by Ala aminotransferase (ALT) in the BS cytosol. The Ala is
transaminated back to pyruvate by ALT activity in the M cytosol. PPDK activity
in M chloroplasts converts pyruvate to PEP .
M cell, and is converted back to pyruvate in the reverse
reaction catalyzed by an ALT active in the M cell cytosol. The
pyruvate is then used by PPDK to regenerate PEP in M cell
chloroplasts.
PCK-Subtype
As for the NAD-ME-subtype, multiple transamination reactions
characterize the C 4-PCK-subtype pathway. In plants using this
enzyme as their primary decarboxylase, both malate and Asp
are formed from OAA ( Figure 4 ). A cytosolic AST in M
cells produces Asp, while OAA is also transported into M cell
chloroplasts and converted to malate by NADP-MDH. The Asp
diﬀuses into the BS, and there a cytosolic AST converts it back
to OAA, which is then decarboxylated by PCK in a reaction
requiring ATP. The released CO 2 enters the PCR cycle in the
BS chloroplasts. The PEP generated from PCK activity diﬀuses
back into the M to be used by PEPC. The malate formed
in M cell chloroplasts is transported out of these organelles,
and into the mitochondria of the BS. As for the NAD-ME-
subtype, a mitochondrial NAD-ME isoform decarboxylates the
malate, the released CO 2 enters BS chloroplasts and the PCR
cycle. The pyruvate formed is ultimately used to regenerate PEP
in the M cell chloroplasts, following the same transamination
reactions as those of the NAD-ME-subtype pathway. The NADH
produced from NAD-ME activity is used in mitochondrial
respiration to make ATP , supporting PCK activity in the BS
cytosol.
PCK-type grasses includeUrochloa panicoides, Chloris gayana,
and some C 4 species of Panicum (Gutierrez et al., 1974; Sage
et al., 2011). It was thought PCK did not play a role in CO 2
assimilation in C 4 dicots; however, signiﬁcant PCK activity has
been reported in several C 4 dicot lineages, including members
of the Sesuvioideae and Cleome (Meister et al., 1996; Muhaidat
et al., 2007; Sommer et al., 2012; Muhaidat and McKown,
2013). In contrast, a more recent study examining C 4 species
in the Cleomaceae, Aizoaceae, and Chenopodiaceae detected
only low levels of PCK in these dicot groups (Koteyeva et al.,
2015).
EVOLUTION OF C4 ACID
DECARBOXYLASES
All the C 4 cycle enzymes involved in the production and
utilization of malate, OAA, Asp, Ala, PEP , and pyruvate have
counterparts in C 3 species, as these organic acids are involved
in a myriad of roles in all plants, as noted above (López-
Bucio et al., 2000). Many of the genes encoding the C 4 proteins
appear to have resulted from duplication events, which allowed
ancestral function to be maintained, while also permitting
neofunctionalization of the other copy, leading to the C4-speciﬁc
roles and expression patterns (Ludwig, 2013). Interestingly, a
number of the genes encoding the enzymes involved in the
metabolism of the organic acids appear to have been co-opted
from the same gene lineage in numerous independent C4 lineages
(Christin et al., 2013, 2015). Changes in regulatory mechanisms
of the ancestral genes, which may involve sequences in the
promoter, untranslated and/or coding regions, and trans-acting
factors led to the distinctive C 4 expression levels and cell-
speciﬁc patterns, while modiﬁcations to the coding regions were
responsible for diﬀerences in the kinetic properties seen between
the C 3 and C 4 enzymes (Williams et al., 2012; Ludwig, 2013).
The evolution of the decarboxylases catalyzing the release of
CO2 from either malate or OAA in the three C 4 subtypes has
been studied to varying levels, and our current knowledge is
summarized below.

Ludwig Organic Acids in C4 Photosynthesis
FIGURE 4 | A representation of the C4 phosphoenolpyruvate
carboxykinase-subtype pathway. Atmospheric CO2 is converted to
bicarbonate (HCO3−) by CA in the mesophyll (M) cytosol. PEP is
carboxylated, producing OAA, by PEPC. The OAA is either transaminated to
Asp by AST in the cytosol, or is reduced to malate in the chloroplast (green
oval) by NADP-MDH. The Asp diffuses into the BS cell cytosol, where it is
transaminated back to OAA, which is then decarboxylated by PEP
carboxykinase (PCK). The resulting PEP diffuses into the M, while the CO2 is
used to make carbohydrates by the PCR cycle. The malate formed in M
chloroplasts is transferred to BS mitochondria (blue oval), where it is
decarboxylated by NAD-ME, with the released CO2 diffusing into BS
chloroplasts for ﬁxation, and the pyruvate being transaminated to Ala in the BS
cytosol by ALT. The Ala is transferred to the M, where another ALT converts it
back to pyruvate, which is then converted to PEP in the chloroplast by PPDK.
NADP-Malic Enzyme
Cytosolic and chloroplastic forms of NADP-ME exist in both
C3 and C 4 plants. The cytosolic proteins play roles in defense,
development, and stress responses by coordinating the levels
of malate, pyruvate, and reducing power needed by a plant
during these processes ( Table 1) (Drincovich et al., 2011; Maier
et al., 2011; Badia et al., 2015). These cytosolic enzymes are
thought to represent the ancestral form of the protein. It has been
suggested for maize that the gene encoding a cytosolic NADP-
ME was duplicated, with one of the resulting copies acquiring
a sequence encoding a chloroplast transit peptide (Tausta et al.,
2002). A duplication of this gene led to the C 4 isoform with
its ability to decarboxylate malate in BS chloroplasts, and
its characteristic properties of tetramerization and regulation,
including inhibition by high malate concentrations at pH 7 and
redox modulation (Detarsio et al., 2007; Alvarez et al., 2012; Saigo
et al., 2013).
A similar duplication of the gene encoding a chloroplastic,
non-C4-associated enzyme has been proposed for the evolution
of the C4 NADP-ME inFlaveria (Marshall et al., 1996). Potentially
interacting regulatory elements found in the 5 ′- and 3 ′-ends
of the F. bidentis gene encoding the C 4-associated NADP-ME
control the level of gene activity, while other sequences in the 5 ′-
end were found to determine BS speciﬁcity ( Table 1) (Marshall
et al., 1997; Ali and Taylor, 2001). In the closely related C 4
species F. trinervia , the high levels of BS-speciﬁc expression
of the C 4-associated NADP-ME are apparently controlled only
by elements in the 5 ′-region of the gene ( Table 1) (Lai et al.,
2002).
Non-C4-associated NADP-ME isoforms targeted to the
chloroplast in C 3 and C 4 plants also appear to be involved in
defense responses, as well as providing pyruvate and NADPH
for lipid and amino acid biosynthesis, and nitrogen assimilation
(Table 1) (Maurino et al., 2001; Drincovich et al., 2011; Maier
et al., 2011; Saigo et al., 2013). Phylogenetic and genomic analyses
have shown that in independent C 4 grass lineages, the same
ancestral ortholog was used as the template for evolution of
the C4-associated NADP-ME isoform, and that positive selection
acted on particular codons, which resulted in adaptive parallel
changes in the cognate proteins (Christin et al., 2009). These
observations support the idea that the number of paths leading
to the evolution of a C 4-associated enzyme is constrained by the
subcellular compartment and milieu in which it must function,
and that, more generally, if suitable evolutionary enablers
were not present in the C 3 ancestor, then the C 4 syndrome
could not evolve (Christin and Osborne, 2013; Christin et al.,
2013).
NAD-Malic Enzyme
Although malate is the substrate of NAD-ME, in C 4 species
using this enzyme as the primary decarboxylase, Asp is actually
the ﬁrst stable organic acid formed. The C 4-associated NAD-
ME is a heterodimer made up of α and β subunits, and as
described above, is highly active in the mitochondria of BS cells.
However, NAD-ME isoforms are found in all plant mitochondria,
where they play a key role in the respiration of malate in
the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle ( Table 1) (Drincovich et al.,
2011; Maier et al., 2011). Given the ubiquitous nature of
this decarboxylase, it is interesting that not more is known
of the evolutionary history of the C 4-associated enzyme in
any C 4 species. The number of active NAD-ME isoforms is
also not clear for many C 3 and C 4 species that have been
examined.

Regulatory sequences directing BS-speciﬁc expression have

gynandra (previously Cleome gynandra; Table 1) (Brown et al.,

genes of Arabidopsis thaliana also drive expression in the
BS of G. gynandra , it appears that the speciﬁc NAD-ME
expression pattern of C 4 species likely resulted from changes
aﬀecting the activity of a trans-acting factor (Brown et al.,
2011).
PEP Carboxykinase
ATP-dependent PCK isoforms are found in all plants. They
are cytosolic enzymes and in C 3 species, have been found to
play signiﬁcant roles in numerous metabolic processes that
require or utilize PEP or OAA ( Table 1 ). These include the
mobilization of carbon from lipids and amino acids in seeds
during gluconeogenesis and seedling development (Leegood
and ap Rees, 1978), the control of stomatal aperture (Penﬁeld
et al., 2012), replenishment of TCA intermediates (Walker et al.,
1999), pH regulation (Walker et al., 1999, 2001; Chen et al.,
2004), synthesis of amino acids, and metabolism of nitrogenous
assimilates during transport to storage tissues (Walker et al., 1999;
Delgado-Alvarado et al., 2007).
In some PCK-type species, gene families have been identiﬁed
(Finnegan et al., 1999; Christin et al., 2008) although overall,
there is limited information regarding the size of the PCK
gene family in both C 3 and C 4 plants, the evolutionary
origin of the C 4-associated PCK isoforms, and the regulatory
mechanism(s) responsible for BS expression. Some of this
lack of knowledge can be explained by the few species
that have been identiﬁed as utilizing PCK as their primary
decarboxylase, and the lack of information on the closest
C3 relative of the C 4 species that have been classiﬁed
as PCK-subtype. A phylogenetic and genomic study has
indicated that in the monocots, gene duplication events gave
rise to diﬀerent PCK gene lineages, and as for NADP-ME,
convergence is seen, with parallel adaptive amino acid changes
in the C 4 isoforms in distinct C 4 lineages, suggesting a
predisposition of these orthologs for “C 4-ness” (Christin et al.,
2009).
FLEXIBILITY IN ORGANIC ACID
PRODUCTION AND UTILIZATION IN C4
PLANTS
The observation that in each C 4 species, the activity of one 4-
C organic acid decarboxylating enzyme predominates in leaf
tissue oﬀered a simple criterion by which to categorize C4 plants,
and stimulated comparative analyses between and within C 4
subtypes at the leaf anatomical, biochemical, physiological, and
molecular biological levels. For example, correlations have been
made between leaf anatomy and primary C 4 decarboxylases
(Gutierrez et al., 1974; Hatch et al., 1975; Kanai and Edwards,
1999; Edwards and Voznesenskaya, 2011). However, work with
a number of C 4 species has also shown that in addition to the
primary decarboxylase, there is increased activity of another of
the C 4 decarboxylases (Gutierrez et al., 1974; Meister et al.,
1996; Kanai and Edwards, 1999; Wingler et al., 1999; Muhaidat
et al., 2007; Pick et al., 2011; Sommer et al., 2012; Muhaidat
and McKown, 2013; Bräutigam et al., 2014; Koteyeva et al.,

recognized early on for C4 species that use Asp as the transferred
organic acid and PCK as the primary decarboxylase, where
malate levels and NAD-ME activity are also appreciable (Edwards
et al., 1971). However, even in species such as sugarcane and
maize, clear NADP-ME subtypes based on the above criteria,
signiﬁcant Asp formation and PCK activity were detected in
the early 14CO2 labeling studies (Kortschak et al., 1965; Hatch
and Slack, 1966). Both empirical and modeling studies now
argue that nearly all C 4 plants transfer more than one 4-C
and 3-C organic acid during CO 2 assimilation, and alternative
decarboxylation pathways function in most C4 species (Pick et al.,
2011; Sommer et al., 2012; Bellasio and Griﬃths, 2014; Kromdijk
et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014). Insights into the consequences
of C ﬂux through the alternative pathways on plant metabolism
suggest they extend beyond the obvious provision of CO 2 for
carbohydrate production, and likely impact on the ability of
C4 plants to cope with diverse and ﬂuctuating environments
(Furbank, 2011; Bellasio and Griﬃths, 2014; Kromdijk et al.,
2014; Sharwood et al., 2014; Stitt and Zhu, 2014; Wang et al.,
2014), and potentially play a role in development (Sommer et al.,
2012).
MAIZE – A CASE STUDY IN FLEXIBILITY
OF C4 ACID PRODUCTION AND
UTILIZATION
Early studies using 14CO2 to label actively photosynthesizing
maize leaves showed that about 75% the label was quickly
incorporated into malate, and 25% into Asp at a slower rate
(Kortschak et al., 1965; Hatch and Slack, 1966; Hatch et al., 1967;
Hatch, 1971). Signiﬁcant PCK activity was subsequently found in
maize leaves (Walker et al., 1997) and isolated BS cells (Wingler
et al., 1999). The scheme of decarboxylase activities in maize
leaves proposed by Wingler et al. (1999) included the “classical”
NADP-ME pathway with the decarboxylation of malate in BS
chloroplasts by NADP-ME, but also the transamination of Asp
to OAA in BS mitochondria, followed by the release of CO 2
in the BS cytosol by PCK, using ATP , the origin of which was
unresolved. Later proposals have suggested that both malate and
Asp are produced from OAA either in the M chloroplasts via
NADP-MDH or through cytosolic AST activity (Pick et al., 2011),
and OAA resulting from Asp transamination in the BS may be
either decarboxylated directly by PCK in the BS cytosol, using
ATP generated from chloroplast activities (Furbank, 2011), or
transported into BS chloroplasts, reduced to malate by NADP-
MDH, with the malate then decarboxylated by chloroplastic
NADP-ME (Figure 5 ) (Furbank, 2011; Pick et al., 2011; Wang
et al., 2014).
The transfer of malate and Asp result in diﬀerent energy
scenarios in the M and BS cells of maize. NADP-ME-type species,
like maize, are typically described as having fewer grana in BS
chloroplasts than in chloroplasts of M cells (Gutierrez et al.,
1974; Hatch et al., 1975; Kanai and Edwards, 1999; Edwards
and Voznesenskaya, 2011), indicating limited capacity for PSII
activity and NADPH production via linear electron transport
in the BS (Leegood et al., 1983; Hatch, 1987; Meierhoﬀ and
FIGURE 5 | Schematic of the proposed carbon ﬂow in maize leaves
when both malate and Asp are the transferred 4-carbon organic acids.
The initial steps of carbon ﬂow are identical, with CA activity converting
atmospheric CO2 to bicarbonate (HCO3−), and PEP being carboxylated by
PEPC to produce OAA in M cells. Purple arrows: When Asp is transferred to
BS cells, there is no net movement of reducing equivalents to the BS. ATP is
required for PCK activity in the BS cytosol; however, there is reduced ATP
demand in the M for PEP regeneration. This is the scenario predicted when
the absorbed irradiance is relatively high in BS cells (Kromdijk et al., 2014;
Wang et al., 2014). Blue arrows: When light striking a leaf is preferentially
absorbed by the M, the ﬂux through PCK decreases. Malate and reducing
equivalents are transferred to the BS. Demand for ATP is lowered in BS cells
due to reduced PCK activity. However, ATP requirements increase in M cells

by Rubisco in BS chloroplasts is transported to the M for
phosphorylation and reduction to triose phosphate (triose-P;

BS for regeneration of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate and starch
production, while the rest is used in carbohydrate synthesis
in M chloroplasts. When malate is decarboxylated by NADP-
ME, reducing equivalents are moved from the M to the BS,
contributing to the NADPH requirements of triose-P generation
in the BS ( Figure 5). The pyruvate returned to the M following
NADP-ME decarboxylation is used by PPDK to generate PEP in
a reaction that uses ATP. This adds to the ATP demand in the
M over that needed for triose-P production. In the case of Asp
being transferred to the BS, no reducing equivalents are moved,
and ATP is required by PCK in the BS for the decarboxylation of
OAA; however, the need for ATP is lessened in the M as PEP is
returned to these cells following PCK activity (Figure 5).
Clearly, for eﬃcient functioning of the maize C 4 pathway
overall, coordination of ATP and reducing equivalent supply and
use must occur between the M and BS. In this regard, it has been
proposed that the ability to move carbon through both malate
and Asp decarboxylation pathways plays a role in adjusting
M and BS energy balance to facilitate eﬃcient functioning of
maize C4 photosynthesis in diverse and changing environments,
and during development (Furbank, 2011; Pick et al., 2011;
Bellasio and Griﬃths, 2014; Kromdijk et al., 2014; Stitt and Zhu,
2014; Wang et al., 2014). It has also been postulated that the
large pools of 3-C and 4-C organic acids, which support their
diﬀusion between M and BS cells in C 4 species (Leegood, 1985;
Stitt and Heldt, 1985), act as reserves of ATP and NADPH to
buﬀer against rapid changes in light availability over longer time
scales than is possible for C 3 plants (Stitt and Zhu, 2014). Being
able to switch between the species of 4-C and 3-C organic acids
that are transferred, with their diﬀering contributions to M and
BS energy balance, strengthens this buﬀering capacity, and the
ability to maintain eﬃcient CO 2 assimilation. The sharing of C
ﬂux between multiple metabolites is also seen as a beneﬁt as it
allows the concentration and diﬀusion gradient of individual 3-C
and 4-C organic acids to be lower without compromising overall
C4 cycle activity (Pick et al., 2011; Kromdijk et al., 2014; Wang
et al., 2014).
So are the suggested advantages of operating a combination
system of transferred organic acids and decarboxylating enzymes
in maize realized? Experimental and modeling studies have
begun to address this question with respect to diﬀering light
environments. Sharwood et al. (2014) looked at the eﬀects of
shading on maize NADP-ME and PCK activities along with
other photosynthetic characteristics. As expected, relative to
control plants, overall biomass and photosynthetic rates of the
shade plants were signiﬁcantly lower, and in addition, both
NADP-ME and PCK amount and activities were reduced in the
shade-grown individuals. Interestingly however, PCK activity was
decreased to a greater extent, with a 75% reduction versus a 60%
drop for NADP-ME (Sharwood et al., 2014). Although energy
partitioning between M and BS cells, BS PSII activity, and/or
grana stacking in the chloroplasts of the two cell types were
not investigated, the results do indicate that light availability
diﬀerentially aﬀects the 4-C organic acid produced, and C ﬂux
through the two decarboxylation pathways utilized by maize
leaves, and consequently the balance of energy in M and BS
cells.
Two recent modeling studies examined the eﬀects of
diﬀering light regimes on M and BS energy partitioning
while considering combination transfer organic acids and
decarboxylating pathways ( Figure 5 ) (Bellasio and Griﬃths,
2014; Wang et al., 2014). A novel metabolic model along with
experimentally measured inputs (Bellasio and Griﬃths, 2014)
showed that ATP and NADPH production were complementary
in maize M and BS cells such that changes in light quality
leading to increases in ATP or reducing power production
in one cell type were oﬀset by decreases in the other. This
work supported the idea that the presence of alternative
decarboxylation pathways, with their diﬀering contributions to
M and BS cell energy demands, are important in maintaining
cell-type energy balance and high leaf CO 2 assimilation rates in
diﬀerent light conditions (Figure 5) (Bellasio and Griﬃths, 2014).
A systems modeling approach taken by Wang et al. (2014) looked
at CO 2 assimilation rate for combination systems of transfer
acids and decarboxylases relative to the standard NADP-ME
pathway when diﬀering amounts of light were allocated to the M
and BS. This analysis also showed that ﬂexibility in the organic
acids transferred between M and BS cells, and the associated
decarboxylase activities, as now recognized as operational in
maize, would ensure high photosynthetic eﬃciency in diﬀering
light environments.
The proposal that a combination of transfer acids and
decarboxylase pathways might contribute to the ability of C 4
leaf organic acid pools to act as capacitors of ATP and reducing
power equivalents in ﬂuctuating light environments (Stitt and
Zhu, 2014) has not been directly tested. However, the systems
modeling approach described above (Wang et al., 2014) did
support the suggestion that the concurrent transfer of multiple
organic acids reduced the concentration gradient of individual
species needed for C 4 pathway function. The concentration
gradients between M and BS cells for the standard NADP-
ME pathway, and the combination pathway now recognized
in maize leaves were simulated. A slight decrease in the
malate gradient was predicted for the combination pathway
compared to the standard NADP-ME pathway, while the
pyruvate gradient was reduced by about 20%. Concentration
gradients for Asp, PEP and Ala were predicted to compensate for
these reductions and ensure eﬃcient C 4 photosynthesis (Wang
et al., 2014).
CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVES
The identiﬁcation of dicarboxylic acids as the initial stable
products of photosynthesis in some plant species was the ﬁrst
recognition of photosynthetic diversity in the terrestrial plant
world. This discovery opened up not only the ﬁeld of C 4
biochemistry, but also all aspects of C 4 plant biology, including
a multitude of comparative studies in the areas of anatomy,
physiology, ecology, evolution, biogeography, and recently,
omics. Much of present day C4 photosynthesis research is focused
on understanding the steps in the evolution of the pathway with
an aim of transferring it into C 3 crop plants to increase yield
and/or mitigate eﬀects of climate change.

Ludwig Organic Acids in C4 Photosynthesis
Four- and 3-C organic acids are the substrates and products
of the C 4 acid transfer cycle that links CO 2 uptake with CO 2
ﬁxation into carbohydrates. In most C 4 plants, these reactions
take place over two cell types and function to concentrate CO2 in
internal cells of a C4 leaf. The genes encoding the decarboxylases
that catalyze the release of CO 2 from the 4-C organic acids
near the sites of ﬁxation and carbohydrate production have
been co-opted for the C 4 pathway from ancestral C 3 genes.
Historically, three subtypes of C 4 plants have been recognized,
based on the transferred 4-C acid and the decarboxylase with
the highest activity in leaf tissue; however, recent work suggests
that the majority of C 4 plants transfer more than one type of 4-
C acid, as well as multiple 3-C acids, during CO 2 ﬁxation, and
have signiﬁcant activity of the required secondary decarboxylase.
Modeling studies indicate that the evolutionary routes to the C 4
syndrome favored combination pathways.
The realization that multiple organic acids are transferred
and combination decarboxylation pathways exist in C 4 species
has expanded our conception of C 4 plant metabolism. However,
we have only begun to comprehend the consequences of this
more complex biochemistry on the overall biology of a C 4 plant.
Increasing evidence indicates that combination pathways allow
ﬂexibility in diﬀering light regimes to meet the energy demands
of the M and BS cells for CO2 ﬁxation, thereby ensuring eﬃcient
functioning of the C 4 CO2 concentrating mechanism. However,
little to no information is available on how combination pathways
may enable C 4 plants to mitigate the eﬀects of other ﬂuctuating
environmental factors or stresses, or how they may play a role
during development.
Future work with C 4 plants should consider the eﬀects
of diﬀering light environments, nutrient availabilities, salinity,
and leaf development on the levels of organic acids and
other metabolites, enzyme and photosystem activities, CO 2
assimilation rates, leaf anatomy, chloroplast ultrastructure, and
M and BS energy status. The inter- and intracellular location
of AST and ALT isoforms, and the identiﬁcation of additional
transporters on organelle membranes would contribute to the
clariﬁcation of actual paths of C ﬂux. Future studies should
also consider the evolutionary history of C 4-associated NAD-
ME and PCK isoforms and identify the molecular changes
responsible for their expression, location and activity. With C 4
species, along with groups containing closely related C 3, C3–C4
intermediate, and C 4-like species, increasingly being examined
in genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and ﬂux
studies, the resolution of the components and mechanisms
of combination pathways will be a focus for future research.
All of the above multifaceted approaches will allow a more
comprehensive understanding of the costs and/or beneﬁts of
operating combination pathways on C 4 plant metabolism,
growth and productivity. In turn, the knowledge will give insights
into the signiﬁcance of these systems on C 4 plant physiology
and ecology, and contribute to attempts to increase C 4 crop
yield and ensure global food security, predict the eﬀects of
diﬀerent climate change scenarios on natural and agricultural C4
species-rich environments, and inform future strategies in plant
biotechnology.
