Abstract
Trehalose 6-phosphate (Tre6P) is a signal metabolite that links carbon metabolism with plant development. Our cur-
rent understanding of Tre6P metabolism and signalling is predominantly based on studies in Arabidopsis thaliana. 
Some 
features could be adapted to the specific physiology, anatomy, and life cycle of this C3 eudicot model species, 
and thus might not be representative of other angiosperms. To better understand Tre6P metabolism in monocot C 4 
species, we used Setaria viridis, which has been widely adopted as a model for the major C4 NADP-malic enzyme sub-
type crop species, such as maize (Zea 
mays), sorghum (Sorghum bicolor), and sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum). In 
this work, we analysed the levels of transcripts encoding Tre6P-related enzymes in different tissues and cell types from 
S. viridis. The TREHALOSE-6-PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE1 transcript, its encoded protein (TPS1, the enzyme responsible 
for Tre6P synthesis), and Tre6P were mainly located in bundle sheath cells of S. viridis. Our results show that Tre6P is 
predominately synthesized and located in bundle sheath and associated cells.

Introduction
Trehalose is a non-reducing disaccharide widely distributed in 
nature (Figueroa and Lunn, 2016 ). In plants, the pathway of 
trehalose synthesis occurs through the phosphorylated 
intermediate trehalose 6-phosphate (Tre6P), which is synthe-
sized from UDP-glucose (UDPGlc) and glucose 6-phosphate 
(Glc6P) by Tre6P synthase (TPS; EC 2.4.1.15) and 
dephosphorylated to trehalose by Tre6P phosphatase (TPP; EC 
3.1.3.12; Cabib and Leloir, 1958 ; Avonce et al., 2006 ). 
Trehalose is then hydrolysed to glucose by trehalase (TRE; 
EC 3.2.1.28). Gene families coding for TPS and TPP are pre -
sent in species from all of the main taxonomic groups of green 
plants ( Avonce et al., 2006 ; Lunn, 2007 ; Lunn et al., 2014 ; 
Figueroa and Lunn, 2016 ). Plant TPSs are divided into two dis -
tinct clades: class I and class II. Class I TPSs are responsible for 
Tre6P synthesis, while class II TPSs (which lack some of the 
glycosyltransferase active site residues involved in substrate 
binding and catalysis) are putatively involved in Tre6P percep -
tion and/or signalling ( Avonce et al., 2006 ; Lunn, 2007 ; 
Vandesteene et al., 2010 ; Lunn et al., 2014 ; Delorge et al., 
2015 ; Figueroa and Lunn, 2016 ; Van Leene et al., 2022 ). In 
the last two decades, studies performed with mutant and trans -
genic lines demonstrated the importance of Tre6P for all stages 
of plant development ( Eastmond et al., 2002 ; van Dijken et al., 
2004 ; Gomez et al., 2006 , 2010 ; Wahl et al., 2013 ; Fichtner 
et al., 2020 ; Ponnu et al., 2020 ; reviewed in Fichtner and 
Lunn, 2021 ).
In Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, Tre6P is synthesized primarily 
in phloem parenchyma (bundle sheath) cells and in the com -
panion cell–sieve element complex of the phloem ( Fichtner 
et al., 2020 ). The phloem parenchyma cells are symplastically 
connected with mesophyll cells (MCs) via plasmodesmata, al -
lowing Tre6P to diffuse into the MCs to regulate sucrose pro -
duction ( Fichtner and Lunn, 2021 ). Tre6P regulates the 
synthesis and transport of sucrose by influencing photoassimi -
late partitioning between sucrose or organic and amino acids 
during the day ( Figueroa et al., 2016 ), transitory starch degrad -
ation during the night and towards the end of the light period 
( Martins et al., 2013 ; dos Anjos et al., 2018 ; Ishihara et al., 2022 ), 
and expression of SWEET (SUGARS WILL EVENTUALLY 
BE EXPORTED TRANSPORTER) genes, which encode 
transporters involved in sucrose phloem loading ( Oszvald 
et al., 2018 ; Fichtner et al., 2021 ). Therefore, Tre6P coordi -
nates the synthesis and transport of sucrose and amino acids 
from source leaves with the demand from growing and sink tis -
sues ( Martins et al., 2013 ; Figueroa et al., 2016 ; dos Anjos et al., 
2018 ). In addition, Tre6P exerts widespread transcriptional re -
pression of photosynthesis, gluconeogenesis, and carbon star -
vation responses, induces amino acid synthesis, nucleotide 
synthesis, and ribosome formation, and interacts with light sig -
nalling and many phytohormone signalling pathways ( Avidan 
et al., 2024 ).
Our current understanding of Tre6P metabolism and signal -
ling in plants is mainly based on studies in A. thaliana ( Fichtner 
and Lunn, 2021 ; Rojas et al., 2023 ). This model eudicot is a 
rosette-forming, annual weed species that performs C
3 
photo -
synthesis and grows predominantly in temperate zones. Some 
features of Tre6P metabolism and signalling in A. thaliana might 
be adapted to its specific physiology, anatomy, and life cycle, and 
so might differ from other species. Tre6P metabolism and 
signalling have also been investigated in maize (Zea mays), a 
domesticated monocot species that performs C
4 
photosynthesis 
and originated in subtropical regions. These studies have re -
vealed the importance of Tre6P metabolism and signalling in 
the coordination of metabolism in source and sink zones, inflor -
escence and shoot branching, floral identity, tillering, seed de -
velopment, and tolerance to water deficit ( Satoh-Nagasawa 
et al., 2006 ; Henry et al., 2014 , 2015 ; Nuccio et al., 2015 ; 
Czedik-Eysenberg et al., 2016 ; Bledsoe et al., 2017 ; Oszvald 
et al., 2018 ; Claeys et al., 2019 ; Dong et al., 2019 ; Klein et al., 
2022 ). However, how far Tre6P metabolism and signalling are 
adapted to the specialized C
4 
photosynthetic metabolism and 
leaf anatomy of this species is poorly understood.
Tre6P regulates photoassimilate partitioning between su -
crose and organic acids and amino acids in A. thaliana via coor -
dinated changes in the activities of nitrate reductase, 
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), and, by inference, 
the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase ( Figueroa et al., 
2016 ). Artificially increased levels of Tre6P reduced the mono- 
ubiquitination and increased the phosphorylation status of 
PEPC, thus activating the enzyme. These changes increased 
carbon flux into organic acids and the tricarboxylic acid cycle 
to provide carbon skeletons for amino acid synthesis. Given 
that PEPC is responsible for primary carbon fixation in the 
C
4 
pathway, Tre6P might therefore play a direct role in regu -
lating photosynthetic carbon fixation in C
4 
plants. This raises 
the question of whether Tre6P is also involved in the regula -
tion of photoassimilate partitioning to amino acids in C
4 
plants 
and, if so, how flux into metabolites in the C
4 
cycle and flux 
into the tricarboxylic acid cycle and amino acid synthesis are 
reconciled. Tre6P also regulates the mobilization of transitory 
starch reserves in A. thaliana leaves and provision of sucrose at 
night ( Martins et al., 2013 ; dos Anjos et al., 2018 ; Ishihara et al., 
2022 ). In contrast to C
3 
plants, where sucrose and starch syn -
thesis both occur within MCs, in C
4 
plants starch synthesis is 
restricted to the bundle sheath cells (BSCs), while sucrose is 
made predominantly in MCs ( Lunn and Furbank, 1997 , 
1999 ). If Tre6P also regulates photoassimilate partitioning 
and transitory starch turnover in C
4 
plants, this cellular com -
partmentation of sucrose and starch metabolism would add a 
further layer of complexity. It has been proposed that expres -
sion of the genes encoding the SWEET and SUT/SUC (su -
crose–H
+ 
symporter) transporters had to be adapted to the 
specialized Kranz anatomy in C
4 
species, and was potentially 
a critical element in the evolution of C
4 
plants ( Furbank and 
Kelly, 2021 ). Mutation of the three maize ZmSWEET13 genes 
produced plants with impaired sugar phloem loading and dras -
tic effects on growth ( Bezrutczyk et al., 2018 ). As Tre6P has 
been implicated in the transcriptional regulation of SWEET 
genes ( Oszvald et al., 2018 ; Fichtner et al., 2021 ), it is possible 
that Tre6P also plays a key role in modulating phloem loading 
during the establishment of Kranz anatomy in developing 
leaves of C
4 
species.
Currently, we have little knowledge about Tre6P signalling 
in the leaves of C
4 
plants ( Rojas et al., 2023 ). By extrapolation 
Compartmentation of Tre6P metabolism in Setaria viridis | 5947
from its known functions in leaves of C
3 
plants, we hypothesize 
that Tre6P plays a role in the regulation of carbon fixation, 
photoassimilate partitioning, and phloem loading in the leaves 
of C
4 
plants. If so, Tre6P signalling in these species may have 
unique features, reflecting their specialized metabolism and 
anatomy. For instance, the TREHALOSE-6-PHOSPHATE 
SYNTHASE1 transcript was mainly found in BSCs of several 
C
4 
species ( Benning et al., 2023 ). To better understand how 
Tre6P signalling operates in C
4 
crops, we investigated the 
compartmentation of Tre6P in leaves of Setaria viridis (wild fox -
tail millet), a model species for translational research in plants 
performing NADP-dependent malic enzyme (NADP-ME) 
C
4 
photosynthesis ( Brutnell et al., 2010 ; Doust et al., 2019 ). 
Our results show that the TPS1 transcript, its encoded protein 
(TPS1), and Tre6P are mainly located in BSCs.
Materials and methods
Plant growth and harvest conditions
Seeds of S. viridis (L.) P. Beauv. accession A10.1 were obtained from the 
Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN; http:/ /www.ars- 
grin.gov/ ), United States Department of Agriculture (PI 669942). To in -
crease the germination rate, the seed coat was abraded with sandpaper 
( Van Eck and Swartwood, 2015 ). Seeds were surface-sterilized with 
0.55 g l
−1 
sodium hypochlorite containing 0.1% (v/v) Tween-20 for 
5 min, followed by three washes with sterile deionized water. The seeds 
were then sown on plates with half-strength Murashige and Skoog me -
dium (PhytoTech Labs; https:/ /phytotechlab.com/ ) supplemented with 
0.8% (w/v) agar. Plates were placed in a growth chamber at 28 °C 
with an irradiance of 120 µmol m
−2 
s
−1
, provided by white fluorescent 
tubes, under a long-day photoperiod regime (16 h light/8 h dark). 
After 5 d, seedlings were transferred to individual 8 cm diameter pots con -
taining Klasmann TS1 substrate and irrigated with 1× Hoagland solution. 
For the analysis of transcripts and proteins, plants were grown in a 
Conviron Adaptis A1000 controlled-environment chamber ( https:/ / 
www.conviron.com/ ) with an irradiance of 350 µmol m
−2 
s
−1
, provided by 
white fluorescent tubes, with a long-day photoperiod regime, at 28/22 °C 
(day/night), and 50% relative humidity for 2 weeks. For metabolite 
fractionation experiments, plants were grown in a walk-in phytotron with 
an irradiance of 550 µmol m
−2 
s
−1
, provided by LEDs, at 28/22 °C 
(day/night) and 65% relative humidity. Harvested plants had eight fully 
developed leaves, and inflorescences were not macroscopically visible. 
The blades from the fifth and sixth true leaves (counting from the bottom 
of the plant) were harvested in the middle of the photoperiod. The leaf 
material used for isolation of MCs and BSCs was immediately processed 
and then stored at −80 °C. For enzymatic and metabolite analyses, leaf 
samples were rapidly quenched in liquid nitrogen and stored at –80 °C 
until use. Samples for the analysis of transcripts and proteins (seedlings, in -
florescences, the fourth internode, and the flag leaf) were frozen in liquid 
nitrogen and stored at −80 °C until use.
Phylogenetic analysis
TPS, TPP, and TRE protein sequences from S. viridis (genome version 
2.1) were identified using the keyword ‘trehalose’ at the Phytozome 13 
server ( https:/ /phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/ ). We followed the same ap -
proach to retrieve TPS and TPP protein sequences from Ananas comosus 
(genome version 3) and Musa acuminata (genome version 1). Sequences 
were manually curated to remove incomplete and duplicated entries. 
TPS and TPP protein sequences from A. thaliana, Brachypodium distachyon, 
Oryza sativa, Phaseolus vulgaris, Populus trichocarpa, Triticum aestivum, and 
Z. mays were obtained from previous publications ( Yang et al., 2012 ; 
Henry et al., 2014 ; Barraza et al., 2016 ; de Haro et al., 2019 ; Wang 
et al., 2019 ; Du et al., 2022 ; Griffiths et al., 2025 ). Sequences were aligned 
with the CLUSTALW tool available at the GenomeNet server ( https:/ / 
www.genome.jp/tools-bin/clustalw ). Distance-based phylogenetic trees 
were reconstructed with the SeaView software version 4.3.0 ( Gouy et al., 
2010 ) using the BioNJ algorithm ( Gascuel, 1997 ) and 1000 replicates. 
Figures were prepared with the FigTree program version 1.3.1 ( http:/ / 
tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/ ). Sequences used to reconstruct the 
trees were labelled as shown in Supplementary Table S1 .
Separation of mesophyll and bundle sheath cells
Fractions highly enriched in MC or BSC strands were obtained from fresh 
leaves following the methods described by John et al. (2014) , with the 
modifications introduced by Calace et al. (2021) . In both cases, each rep -
licate consisted of the material obtained from 20 plants. These samples 
were used for the analysis of transcripts and proteins. To assess the suitabil -
ity of the fractionation procedure, we performed western blots using 
commercial antibodies raised against the large subunit of Rubisco 
(RbcL; Agrisera AS03 037; https:/ /www.agrisera.com/ ) and PEPC 
(Agrisera AS09 458), as described below for the immunoblotting of 
SvTPS1. In Supplementary Fig. S1 it is shown that Rubisco and PEPC 
were exclusively detected in BSC and MC fractions, respectively.
To determine the distribution of metabolites, frozen leaf tissue was 
finely ground in liquid nitrogen and the frozen tissue powder was passed 
through a series of nylon meshes of different pore sizes (200, 80, and 
41 µm). The material that was retained on each filter and the one that 
passed through the 41 µm filter were collected to obtain the samples 
named F200, F80, F40, and FT, respectively. The F200 fraction, depend -
ing on the grinding, often has larger whole-leaf bits but tends to be en -
riched in BSCs; the F80 fraction is especially enriched in BSCs; the 
F40 fraction is usually a mix of BSCs and MCs; and the FT fraction is es -
pecially enriched in MCs ( Stitt and Heldt, 1985 ). This method is suitable 
for the quantification of metabolites with short half-lives ( Arrivault et al., 
2009 , 2017 ). Metabolites and enzymes, including cell-specific marker en -
zymes, were measured in each fraction, and their distribution between 
MCs and BSCs was calculated by linear regression, as described by Stitt 
and Heldt (1985) . Two C
4 
photosynthetic enzymes were used as markers 
for each cell type: PEPC and NADP-dependent malate dehydrogenase 
(NADP-MDH) for MCs and NADP-ME and phosphoribulokinase 
(PRK) for BSCs. Each biological replicate consisted of the material ob -
tained from 20 plants.
Total RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis
Total RNA was extracted from 50 mg FW of finely ground tissue 
with the TransZol reagent (TransGen Biotech; https:/ /www. 
transgenbiotech.com/ ), following the manufacturer’s instructions. After 
RNA extraction, samples were treated with DNase (Promega; https:/ / 
www.promega.com ) and the RNA concentration was quantified using 
a NanoDrop 2000 (Thermo Scientific; https:/ /www.thermofisher. 
com ). cDNA was synthesized with the MultiScribe Reverse 
Transcriptase (Applied Biosystems; https:/ /www.thermofisher.com ), ac -
cording to the manufacturer’s instructions.
Determination of transcript levels
Quantitative real-time reverse transcription–PCRs (RT–qPCRs) were 
performed in a final volume of 8 µl in 96-well microplates (Applied 
Biosystems) with the iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad; https:/ / 
www.bio-rad.com ), 0.2 µM of each primer, and an appropriate dilution 
of the sample. Transcript abundance was calculated with the comparative 
C
t 
method ( Schmittgen and Livak, 2008 ) and normalization was performed 
with the SvKIN transcript (Sevir.4G252700; Martins et al., 2016 ), which 
5948 | Tonetti et al.
showed similar C
t 
values across all the analysed samples ( Supplementary 
Fig. S2 ). All the primers used in this work are listed in Supplementary 
Table S2 .
Production of a polyclonal antiserum against SvTPS1
The protein-coding region of the class I TPS gene (SvTPS1; Uniprot ID 
A0A4U6VAG9) was codon-optimized and de novo synthesized (BioBasic; 
https:/ /www.biobasic.com/ ) for expression in Escherichia coli 
( Supplementary Table S3 ) and cloned into the pET28b expression vector 
(Novagen; https:/ /www.merckmillipore.com ) between the NdeI and 
SacI restriction sites, in-frame with a His
6
-tag at the N-terminus. The re -
sulting vector was used to transform E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells (Invitrogen; 
https:/ /www.thermofisher.com ). Transformed cells were grown in 
Lysogeny Broth medium, supplemented with 50 µg ml
−1 
kanamycin at 
37 °C, with shaking at 200 rpm until the optical density at 600 nm 
reached ∼0.6. Synthesis of the recombinant protein was induced by add -
ition of isopropyl-β- D -thiogalactopyranoside to a final concentration of 
1 mM and cells were incubated for 16 h at 25 °C and 200 rpm after induc -
tion. The recombinant SvTPS1 protein was mainly present in the insol -
uble fraction; thus, it was purified from inclusion bodies ( Jenö and Horst, 
2002 ). This protein was used to raise a polyclonal antiserum in rabbits at 
ICIVET Litoral (UNL-CONICET, Argentina). Antibodies were 
affinity-purified using a nitrocellulose membrane strip containing the re -
combinant SvTPS1, as described by Fang (2012) .
Protein extraction
Plant material was homogenized in a pre-cooled mortar with liquid nitro -
gen. For denaturing protein extraction, 20 mg FW of frozen tissue were 
extracted with 200 µl of 125 mM Tris–HCl pH 6.8, 2% (w/v) SDS, 20% 
(v/v) glycerol, 1.4 M 2-mercaptoethanol, and 0.05% (w/v) 
Bromophenol Blue. After adding the buffer, samples were vortex-mixed 
and heated for 5 min at 95 °C with agitation. Samples were then cooled to 
room temperature and centrifuged at 20 000 g for 10 min to separate the 
protein extract from insoluble tissue debris. Alternatively, 50 mg FW of 
frozen tissue were resuspended in 500 µl of 10 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 
10% (v/v) trichloroacetic acid (TCA), 25 mM ammonium acetate, and 
1 mM EDTA ( Rojas et al., 2021 ). Samples were incubated at 4 °C for 
30 min and centrifuged at 20 000 g for 15 min. The supernatant was dis -
carded and the pellet was washed with 500 µl of 5% (w/v) TCA and then 
with 500 µl of 90% (v/v) acetone, then allowed to dry before the protein 
pellet was dissolved in 50 µl of Laemmli buffer for analysis by SDS– 
PAGE.
Protein extraction for enzymatic assays was performed as described by 
Gibon et al. (2004) , with minor modifications. Samples (20 mg FW of 
frozen tissue) were supplemented with 10 mg of polyvinylpolypyrroli -
done and then resuspended in 500 µl of 50 mM HEPES-KOH pH 7.5, 
10 mM MgCl
2
, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1 mM benzamidine, 
1 mM ɛ-aminocaproic acid, 0.02 mM leupeptin, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM 
phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 0.1% (v/v) Triton X-100, and 
20% (v/v) glycerol. Samples were incubated on ice for 10 min and then 
centrifuged at 20 000 g and 4 °C for 10 min to separate soluble proteins 
from tissue debris.
Protein concentration was determined with the Bradford reagent 
( Bradford, 1976 ), using a standard curve constructed with BSA.
Immunoblotting
Protein extracts were subjected to 10% SDS–PAGE and electrotrans -
ferred to a 0.45 µm nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham; https:/ / 
www.cytivalifesciences.com/ ). To check lane loadings, membranes 
were stained with 0.01% (w/v) Ponceau S in 1% (v/v) acetic acid. 
After washing with TBST1 solution [50 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0; 
150 mM NaCl; 0.2% (v/v) Tween-20], membranes were blocked for 
1 h with TBST1 supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) fat-free dried milk pow -
der. Membranes were incubated overnight at 4 °C with purified 
anti-SvTPS1 in TBST1 supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) fat-free dried 
milk powder. After washing, the membranes were incubated for 
30 min at room temperature with goat anti-rabbit IgG (H&L) conjugated 
to horseradish peroxidase (Agrisera AS09 602). Proteins were detected us -
ing the ECL Bright reagent (Agrisera AS16 ECL-N) and exposed to 
X-ray films (AGFA; https:/ /www.agfa.com/corporate/ ) for 1 min. The 
sizes of the immunoreactive bands were estimated from the relative mo -
bility (Rf) versus logarithm of molecular weight (logMM) plot con -
structed with protein standards, using data from three independent 
experiments.
Immunoprecipitation of SvTPS1
Proteins were extracted from 100 mg FW of BSCs with 400 μl of a buffer 
containing 100 mM Bicine pH 9.0, 10% (v/v) glycerol, 0.1% (v/v) Triton 
X-100, 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 2 mM 
PMSF, and 1× Protease Inhibitor Cocktail III (Calbiochem; https:/ / 
www.sigmaaldrich.com/ ). Immunoprecipitation was performed as de -
scribed by Hartman et al. (2023) , with minor modifications. Briefly, anti -
body–bead conjugates were prepared by adding 5 μl of polyclonal 
anti-SvTPS1 antibody to a microcentrifuge tube containing 200 µl of 
TBST2 [50 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0; 150 mM NaCl; 0.05% (v/v) 
Tween-20] and 75μl of protein A–Sepharose beads (Sigma). 
Conjugates were incubated for 90 min at room temperature with gentle 
mixing and then washed with TBST2 to remove unbound antibodies. 
The protein extract (150 μl) was incubated with the antibody–bead con -
jugate for 16 h at 4 °C with gently mixing. After washing with TBST2, 
the pellet was resuspended with Laemmli buffer and heated at 95 °C 
for 10 min. The sample was then centrifuged at room temperature and 
10 000 g for 5 min, and the resulting supernatant was separated by 
SDS–PAGE. The gel was stained using colloidal Coomassie Blue 
G-250. Controls were processed in parallel without either antibodies or 
the protein extract.
Mass spectrometry analysis
Tryptic peptides from the gel fragment were obtained using the protocol 
of Link and LaBaer (2009) and analysed by MS at the Mass Spectrometry 
Unit of the Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology of Rosario 
(UNR-CONICET), Argentina. The sample (3 µl) was injected on a 
nanoHPLC Ultimate3000 (Thermo Scientific) and peptides were sepa -
rated using a nano column EASY-Spray ES901 (15 cm×50 μm ID, 
PepMap RSLC C18). The mobile phase flow rate was 300 nl min
–1 
using 
0.1% formic acid in water (solvent A) and 0.1% formic acid and 100% 
acetonitrile (solvent B). The gradient profile was set as follows: 4–30% 
solvent B for 10 min, 30–80% solvent B for 2 min, and 90% solvent B 
for 1 min. MS analysis was performed using a Q-Exactive HF mass spec -
trometer (Thermo Scientific). For ionization, 1.9 kV of liquid junction 
voltage and 250 °C of capillary temperature were used. The full scan 
method employed an m/z 375–2000 mass selection, an Orbitrap reso -
lution of 120 000 (at m/z 200), a target automatic gain control (AGC) val -
ue of 1e6, and a maximum injection time of 100 ms. After the survey 
scan, the five most intense precursor ions were selected for MS/MS 
fragmentation.
Fragmentation was performed with a normalized collision energy of 
27 eV and MS/MS scans were acquired with a dynamic first mass, 
AGC target of 5e5, resolution of 30 000 (at m/z 200), isolation window 
of 1.4 m/z units, and maximum IT of 55 ms. Charge state screening was 
enabled to reject unassigned, singly charged, and ≥6 protonated ions. A 
dynamic exclusion time of 10 s was used to discriminate against previous -
ly selected ions.
MS data were analysed with Proteome Discoverer 2.4.1.15, using 
standardized workflows. The mass spectra raw file was searched against

the S. viridis deduced proteome (UniProt ID UP000298652). Precursor 
and fragment mass tolerance were set to 10 ppm and 0.02 Da, respective -
ly, allowing two missed cleavages, with Cys carbamidomethylation 
(+57.021 Da) as the fixed modification, and the following dynamic mod -
ifications: Met oxidation (+15.995 Da), N-term acetylation 
(+42.011 Da), Met loss (−131.040 Da), and Met loss plus acetylation 
(−89.030 Da).
The raw proteomics data were deposited in the PRIDE repository 
( https:/ /www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/ ) with the dataset identifier PXD057139.
Immunohistochemistry
Tissue fixation, dehydration, assembly of the paraffin block, and micro -
tome cutting were performed as described by Cabello and Chan 
(2019) , with minor modifications. Sections of 0.5–1.0 cm in length from 
the sixth leaf of 3-week-old plants (without the midrib) were fixed at 
25 °C for 1 h in a solution containing 3.7% (v/v) formaldehyde, 5% (v/v) 
acetic acid, and 47.5% (v/v) ethanol. To further fix and discolour the 
tissue, sections were incubated in 70% (v/v) ethanol for 2 weeks. Sections 
were dehydrated through a series of ethanol solutions (80, 90, 96, and 
100%; 30 min each), followed by incubation in ethanol–xylene solutions 
(3:1; 1:1, and 1:3; 1 h each), and finally stored overnight in 100% xylene 
at room temperature. To obtain the paraffin blocks, sections were incu -
bated through a series of xylene–paraffin solutions (3:1, 1:1, and 1:3; 1 h 
each). The samples were placed into plastic casts and finally embedded in 
Histoplast (Biopack; https:/ /www.biopack.com.ar/ ). Each block was in -
cubated overnight at room temperature to ensure solidification. 
Cross-sections (10 μm thick) were obtained using a Microtome 
RM2125 (Leica Microsystems; https:/ /www.leica-microsystems.com/ ) 
and mounted on slides coated with 50 mg/ml poly- D -lysine (Sigma) in 
10 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0 and dried for 16 h at 37 °C. Paraffin was re -
moved with 100% xylene for 15 min at room temperature and sections 
were rehydrated using a series of ethanol (100, 96, 90, 80, 70, and 50%; 
1 min each) to finish in distilled water.
Immunolocalization of proteins in S. viridis leaves was performed as de -
scribed by Sauer and Friml (2010) , with minor modifications. Mounted 
cross-sections were rinsed three times in phosphate-buffered saline 
(PBS; 10 mM sodium phosphate, 130 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) and blocked 
with PBS with the addition of 1% (w/v) BSA and 0.1% (v/v) 
Tween-20 (blocking solution) at room temperature for 1 h in a humid 
chamber. The blocking solution was removed and sections were incu -
bated for 2 h at room temperature with the anti-RbcL (Agrisera AS03 
037; dilution 1:1000) or the purified anti-SvTPS1 (see above; dilution 
1:100) in blocking solution. Tissue sections were washed three times 
with blocking solution and then incubated with Cy2-conjugated goat 
anti-rabbit IgG (Jackson ImmunoResearch 111-225-144; https:/ /www. 
jacksonimmuno.com/ ; dilution 1:200). Samples were incubated at 
room temperature for 1 h, washed three times with blocking solution, 
and air-dried. Sections incubated only with the secondary antibody 
were used as a negative control. Finally, samples were mounted with 
85% (v/v) glycerol and a coverslip. Micrographs were taken with an 
SP8 LIGHTNING confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems) using 
the ×20 objective and the Cy2 bis NHS ester fluorophore channel (exci -
tation 492 nm, emission 510 nm). Images were processed using the LAS 
X Office 1.4.7.28982 software (Leica Microsystems), and figures were 
prepared with Inkscape 0.92.2 ( https:/ /inkscape.org/ ).
Metabolite extraction and measurement
Phosphorylated intermediates and organic acids were extracted with a mix -
ture of chloroform:methanol (3:7) and then measured by anion-exchange 
LC-MS/MS, as described by Lunn et al. (2006) , with the modifications in -
troduced by Figueroa et al. (2016) . Calvin–Benson cycle intermediates and 
aspartate were measured in chloroform–methanol extracts by ion-pair re -
verse phase LC-MS/MS, as described by Arrivault et al. (2009) . Pyruvate, 
phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), and 
3-phosphoglycerate (3PGA) were enzymatically measured in TCA extracts 
( Arrivault et al., 2017 ). The content of sucrose, glucose, and fructose in 
ethanolic extracts was determined following the method of Stitt et al. 
(1989) , while the amount of starch was measured using the insoluble resi -
due from the ethanolic extraction, as described by Hendriks et al. (2003) . 
The datasets containing metabolite levels and the associated calculations 
are available in Supplementary Tables S4–S6 .
Enzyme activity assays
PRK activity was measured spectrophotometrically using a continuous 
assay ( Leegood, 1990 ), with minor modifications. The assay mixture con -
tained: 50 mM Tricine-KOH pH 8.0, 1 mM ATP, 50 mM KCl, 0.3 mM 
NADH, 10 mM MgCl
2
, 2 mM PEP, 2 U of pyruvate kinase, and 2 U of 
lactate dehydrogenase, and the reaction was started by adding 0.5 mM 
ribulose 5-phosphate. PEPC, NADP-MDH, and NADP-ME activities 
were measured as described by Ashton et al. (1990) , with minor modifi -
cations. The PEPC assay mixture contained: 50 mM Tricine-KOH pH 
8.0, 5 mM MgCl
2
, 2 mM DTT, 1 mM KHCO
3
, 5 mM Glc6P, 
0.3 mM NADH, and 0.4 U of MDH, and the reaction was started with 
2 mM PEP. The NADP-MDH assay mixture contained: 50 mM 
Tricine-KOH pH 8.0, 70 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, and 
0.3 mM NADPH, and the reaction was started with 1 mM oxaloacetate 
(freshly prepared). The NADP-ME assay mixture contained: 50 mM 
Tricine-KOH pH 8.0, 0.5 mM NADP
+
, 0.1 mM EDTA, and 2 mM 
MgCl
2
, and the reaction was started with 5 mM malate. All reactions 
were performed in a final volume of 200 µl at 25 °C in 96-well micro -
plates. The reduction/oxidation of NAD(P)
+
/NAD(P)H was followed 
by measuring the absorbance at 340 nm in a Biotek ELx808 microplate 
reader. The amount of crude extract added to the reaction was chosen 
to ensure a linear response of the signal. One unit (U) of enzyme activity 
is defined as the amount of extract producing 1 µmol of product in 1 min 
under the specified assay conditions.
Results
Phylogenetic analysis of trehalose 6-phosphate-related 
enzymes
To identify the proteins involved in Tre6P metabolism in S. 
viridis, we performed keyword searches against its deduced 
proteome. We found 21 putative Tre6P-related enzymes: 10 
TPSs, 10 TPPs, and one TRE ( Supplementary Table S1 ), as 
previously observed for Setaria italica ( Henry et al., 2020 ), a do -
mesticated relative of S. viridis. After removing duplicated se -
quences or splicing variants (for SvTPP1, SvTPP8, and 
SvTPP10), phylogenetic trees were reconstructed for TPS 
and TPP proteins ( Fig. 1 ; Supplementary Fig. S3 , respectively). 
The S. viridis TPS sequences were split into two major clades 
containing class I and class II TPSs, as previously described 
for TPSs from A. thaliana, poplar, rice, pea, wheat, and maize 
( Leyman et al., 2001 ; Avonce et al., 2006 ; Lunn, 2007 ; Yang 
et al., 2012 ; Henry et al., 2014 ; Barraza et al., 2016 ; Paul 
et al., 2018 ; de Haro et al., 2019 ). Setaria viridis has only one class 
I TPS (SvTPS1), which diverges from the other nine class II 
TPS proteins (SvTPS2–SvTPS10; Fig. 1 ). All S. viridis TPS se -
quences displayed the glycosyltransferase family 20 domain 
(InterPro ID IPR001830) and the TPP domain (InterPro ID 
IPR003337) that are typical of plant TPS proteins.

Fig. 1. Phylogenetic relationships of Setaria viridis TPS proteins. TPS protein sequences were collated from Setaria viridis (Sv) and other selected species: 
Ac, Ananas comosus; At, Arabidopsis thaliana; Bd, Brachypodium distachyon; Mc, Musa acuminata; Os, Oryza sativa; Pt, Populus trichocarpa; Pv, 
Phaseolus vulgaris; Ta, Triticum aestivum; Zm, Zea mays (see Supplementary Table S1 for gene/protein identifiers). A distance-based tree was reconstructed 
using the BioNJ algorithm. Numbers in nodes represent the bootstrap obtained for 1000 replicates. The tree is rooted on the E. coli TPS (otsA). Subclades in 
the tree are coloured according to the position of A. thaliana TPS sequences, with the exception of the monocot-specific subclade. S. viridis sequences are 
highlighted.
Compartmentation of Tre6P metabolism in Setaria viridis | 5951
Inspection of the primary sequence of S. viridis TPSs in detail 
showed that only SvTPS1 had the characteristic residues in -
volved in UDPGlc and Glc6P binding ( Supplementary Fig. 
S4 ). The class II TPS sequences from S. viridis (SvTPS2– 
SvTPS10) were distributed into several branches, most of 
which contained proteins from eudicot and monocot species. 
The exceptions were the monocot-specific subclade contain -
ing SvTPS2/3/9 and that containing M. acuminata TPS8 and 
TPS16, which branched at the base of the class II TPS tree 
( Fig. 1 ), an observation initially made by Lunn (2007) . A de -
tailed inspection of S. viridis class II TPS sequences showed 
substitutions in the substrate-binding residues of the glucosyl -
transferase domain that might explain their apparent lack of 
catalytic activity ( Supplementary Fig. S4 ; Gibson et al., 2002 ; 
Vandesteene et al., 2010 ). The phylogenetic and sequence ana -
lyses indicate that SvTPS1 is the enzyme solely responsible for 
Tre6P synthesis in S. viridis.
The S. viridis TPP family was separated into two major 
clades: three members in clade A and the other seven in clade 
B ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). All TPP sequences from S. viridis 
had the TPP domain (InterPro ID IPR003337) and the three 
conserved active site motifs previously described for these pro -
teins ( Avonce et al., 2006 ; Lunn, 2007 ; Vandesteene et al., 
2012 ; Henry et al., 2014 ; Kerbler et al., 2023 ); thus, all 10 S. 
viridis TPP proteins are likely to be catalytically active 
( Supplementary Fig. S5 ). Among these, we found SvTPP10 
and SvTPP2, the orthologues of RAMOSA3 (ZmTPP10) 
and ZmTPP4, respectively ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ), which 
modify inflorescence branching, sex determination, and tiller -
ing in maize ( Satoh-Nagasawa et al., 2006 ; Claeys et al., 2019 ; 
Klein et al., 2022 ), independently of their catalytic activity.
Differential expression and compartmentation of trehalose 
6-phosphate-related transcripts
To analyse the expression pattern of the identified S. viridis 
TPS, TPP, and TRE genes, we performed real-time RT– 
qPCR analysis of mRNA extracted from the aerial part of 
5-day-old seedlings, whole leaves (pool of leaves 5 and 6), 
the flag leaf, whole inflorescences, and the fourth internode 
of the stem (all samples harvested in the middle of the day). 
In addition, we measured the levels of transcripts encoding en -
zymes involved in the C
4 
cycle with differential expression in 
MCs (SvNADP-MDH and SvPEPC) and BSCs (SvNADP-ME 
and SvRbcS, which codes for the small subunit of Rubisco) 
from S. viridis and maize leaves ( Li et al., 2010 ; Chang et al., 
2012 ; John et al., 2014 ). We also analysed the transcripts encod -
ing the sucrose transporters SvSWEET13a and SvSWEET13b, 
which have been detected in BSCs from S. viridis leaves ( Chen 
et al., 2022 ) and are putatively regulated by Tre6P ( Oszvald 
et al., 2018 ; Fichtner et al., 2021 ). These transcripts were de -
tected in all samples, with the highest expression in fully devel -
oped leaves and seedlings ( Supplementary Fig. S6 ).
SvTPS1 was mainly detected in whole leaves and the inter -
node and, to a lesser extent, in seedlings, the flag leaf, and the 
inflorescence. Class II TPS transcripts were differentially ex -
pressed among the analysed tissues; most of these transcripts 
were highly expressed in whole leaves and seedlings but only 
marginally in the internode and the inflorescence. The 
SvTPS3 transcript showed the highest level in seedlings and 
whole leaves; the levels of SvTPS6 and SvTPS9 were similar 
to those observed for SvTPS1 in whole leaves; the SvTPS7 
transcript displayed the highest level in the flag leaf; whereas 
the levels of SvTPS7 and SvTPS6 were comparable but lower 
than for SvTPS1 in the internode ( Supplementary Fig. S6 ).
SvTPP transcripts also showed a differential spatial distribu -
tion, being higher in whole leaves and internode samples. 
Among clade A TPP transcripts, SvTPP1 showed the highest 
levels in whole leaves, the inflorescence, and the internode, 
with a maximum in the latter, while SvTPP8 displayed the 
highest levels in seedlings, the flag leaf, and the fourth inter -
node. Regarding clade B TPP transcripts, SvTPP2 was consist -
ently the one with the highest level in all the samples, showing 
a maximum in the fourth internode. The highest level of the 
SvTPP10 transcript (the orthologue of RAMOSA3) was ob -
served in the fourth internode. SvTRE was detected in all 
the samples, and its abundance was maximal in the internode 
( Supplementary Fig. S6 ).
To determine the compartmentation of these transcripts in ma -
ture leaves, we applied fractionation protocols ( John et al., 2014 ; 
Calace et al., 2021 ) to enrich samples in BSCs and MCs, followed 
by RNA extraction and analysis by RT–qPCR ( Fig. 2 ). The 
marker transcripts SvNADP-MDH and SvPEPC were highly en -
riched in the MC fraction, while SvNADP-ME and SvRbcS were 
mainly detected in the BSC fraction ( Fig. 2A ). The SvTPS1 tran -
script was almost exclusively found in the BSC fraction ( Fig. 2B ). 
It should be noted that BSC strands, while enriched in BSCs, also 
contain phloem (companion cells and sieve elements) and xylem 
tissue. In A. thaliana leaves, the AtTPS1 protein is localized pri -
marily in phloem parenchyma (bundle sheath) cells and in the 
companion cell–sieve element complex of the phloem 
( Fichtner et al., 2020 ). Thus, some of the SvTPS1 transcript we 
attribute to the BSCs might be in the phloem complex. The 
SvTPS3 and SvTPS10 transcripts were also preferentially located 
in the BSC fraction, while SvTPS6 and SvTPS8 also showed 
higher levels in BSCs than in MCs, although with a lower enrich -
ment ( Fig. 2B ). Conversely, SvTPS4 and SvTPS7 transcripts 
were more abundant in the MC fraction; indeed, SvTPS7 was 
not even detected in BSCs ( Fig. 2B ). Among the TPP transcripts, 
SvTPP1 displayed similar levels in both fractions; SvTPP2, 
SvTPP3, SvTPP7, and SvTPP9 showed a significant enrichment 
in the BSC fraction; and SvTPP4 was only detected in the BSC 
fraction ( Fig. 2C ). The SvTRE transcript was equally distributed 
in both cell types, whereas the SvSWEET13a and SvSWEET13b 
transcripts were highly enriched in BSCs ( Fig. 2D ). It is important 
to note that Fig. 2 does not include transcripts that were not de -
tected in either the BSC or MC fractions.

Tissue- and cell-specific distribution of the SvTPS1 protein
We recently performed a proteomic analysis with samples en-
riched in MCs and BSCs from S. viridis leaves (Calace et al
., 
2021). In our dataset, which contains 1334 proteins from 
MCs and 1268 proteins from BSCs, we observed that 
SvTPS1 was detected in two out of four biological replicates 
from the BSC fraction and was absent from the MC fraction 
(Fig. 3A ). To further investigate the distribution of the 
SvTPS1 protein in different cells, we used an antiserum raised 
against recombinant SvTPS1 and proteins extracted from MC- 
and BSC-enriched samples with TCA and Laemmli buffers. 
The antiserum recognized two protein bands in the BSC frac
-
tion of ∼
112 kDa and 118 kDa (Fig. 3B, C), in agreement with 
the predicted molecular mass of SvTPS1 (108.4 kDa). 
Extraction with TCA is expected to rapidly denature any pro
-
teases in the samples ( Rojas et al
., 2021), indicating that the 
double band does not result from proteolytic cleavage of the 
SvTPS1 protein during the extraction procedure. We then an-
alysed the distribution of SvTPS1 in different tissues. The pro-
tein was detected in all the analysed samples, with maximal 
signals in whole leaves and the internode (Fig. 3D), which re-
sembles the distribution observed for the SvTPS1 transcript 
(Supplementary Fig. S6). The loading controls and full-size im-
ages that support Fig. 3B
–D are presented in Supplementary 
Fig. S7, which also shows that the purified anti-TPS1 
antiserum cross-reacted with a protein of ∼50 kDa in samples 
extracted with Laemmli buffer.
To confirm the identity of the protein recognized by the 
polyclonal antibody, we immunoprecipitated SvTPS1 from 
samples enriched in BSCs. A protein band corresponding to 
∼115 kDa was sliced from the gel and analysed by LC-MS 
(Supplementary Fig. S8). Supplementary Table S7 shows that 
the most abundant protein from S. viridis present in the sample 
was TPS1 (UniProt ID A0A4U6VAG9), with a coverage of 
36%, 28 unique peptides, and 51 spectra. We analysed in detail 
the MS data for immunoprecipitated SvTPS1 but we did not 
detect any post-translationally modified peptide that could ex-
plain the existence of two immunoreactive bands, probably 
due to the extraction and/or immunoprecipitation procedures 
employed in this work.
To confirm the location of SvTPS1 on S. viridis leaves, we 
performed an immunohistochemical assay. Cross-sections of 
S. viridis leaves were incubated with purified anti-SvTPS1, 
anti-RbcL (positive control for BSCs), or without primary 
antibody (negative control), and then with goat anti-rabbit 
IgG conjugated with Cy2. As shown in Fig. 4 and 
Supplementary Fig. S9, SvTPS1 was preferentially detected 
in BSCs, although we also observed fluorescence in some 
MCs. This result was consistent with the signal observed for 
the large subunit of Rubisco, which was mainly detected in 
BSCs and, to a lesser extent, in MCs (Fig. 4; Supplementary

nal (Fig. 4; Supplementary Fig. S9). Overall, these results indi-
cated that the TPS1 protein is mainly located in BSCs of S. 
viridis leaves.
Intercellular distribution of trehalose 6-phosphate
To determine the intercellular distribution of Tre6P, we 
prepared fractions enriched in MCs or BSCs from S. viridis 
leaves by sequential filtering of frozen leaf tissue powder 
through a series of nylon meshes with different pore 
sizes, according to Stitt and Heldt (1985). We performed 
two independent experiments (Experiments 1 and 2, 
Supplementary Tables S4 and S5, respectively), each one 
consisting of four biological replicates. Supplementary Fig. 
S10 shows the results obtained for marker enzymes from 
Experiment 1. The recovery of marker enzymes in 
Experiments 1 and 2 varied between 57% and 87%, depend
-
ing on the enzyme and the experiment ( Supplementary 
Table S8). The relative distribution of these enzymatic

activities indicated that the fractionation method was suc -
cessfully adapted to S. viridis leaves, as the results resemble 
those obtained for maize leaves ( Stitt and Heldt, 1985; 
Arrivault et al
., 2017; Denton et al., 2017 ). We then meas -
ured ∼
30 metabolites (including Tre6P) by LC-MS/MS, 
whereas pyruvate, PEP, 3PGA, DHAP, soluble sugars, and 
starch were determined by enzymatic assays. With these 
data, we calculated the proportion of each metabolite in 
BSCs and MCs ( Supplementary Tables S4
–S6).
For Experiment 2, we estimated that ∼83% of Tre6P was in 
the BSC fraction (Fig. 5; Supplementary Table S5). As already 
noted, some of this Tre6P might be in the phloem complex it-
self, rather than in BSCs. Other metabolites that were predom-
inantly in the BSC fraction included pyruvate, 3PGA, sucrose, 
and starch; conversely, DHAP was mainly found in the 
MC fraction, while PEP was almost equally distributed be -
tween BSCs and MCs ( Fig. 5; Supplementary Table S5). It 
should be noted that we estimated similar proportions for

Tre6P, DHAP, and starch in Experiment 1 (Supplementary 
Tables S4, S6).
The levels of Tre6P and sucrose are tightly correlated across 
many treatments and conditions in A. thaliana leaves (Yadav 
et al., 2014). To test whether soluble sugars were correlated 
with Tre6P in S. viridis leaves, we measured these metabolites 
in whole leaves harvested every 4 h during the light 
period, from Zeitgeber time (ZT) 0 to 16 h (Supplementary 
Fig. S11; Supplementary Table S9). At the whole-leaf level, 
Tre6P was not significantly correlated with glucose, fructose, 
or sucrose (Fig. 6). As previously mentioned, the leaves of C4 
plants have an additional complexity compared with those 
from C3 plants, due to the arrangement of MCs and BSCs in 
the characteristic Kranz anatomy. Thus, we performed the 
same analysis using data from the second fractionation experi
-
ment (Supplementary Fig. S11; Supplementary Table S5). As 
shown in Fig. 6, across cell type-enriched fractions, Tre6P 
was significantly correlated with sucrose and fructose and, to 
a lesser extent, with glucose.
Discussion
Tre6P metabolism is critical for plant growth and development 
(Fichtner and Lunn, 2021), and recent reports indicate that it 
might be an important metabolic target to engineer crops 
with improved agronomic traits (Kretzschmar et al., 2015; 
Nuccio et al., 2015; Griffiths et al., 2016; Gabriel et al., 
2021). However, most of our knowledge on this signal mol -
ecule is based on studies carried out with the model plant 
A. thaliana
, a eudicot that performs C3 photosynthesis (Rojas 
et al
., 2023). Here, we studied the compartmentation of 
Tre6P metabolism in S. viridis, a model system for studying 
C4 photosynthesis and associated traits (Brutnell et al., 2010; 
Doust et al., 2019).
To gain an overview of Tre6P and trehalose metabolism in 
S. viridis
, we searched the genome sequence to identify all rec-
ognizable TPS
, TPP, and TRE genes, and then performed a 
phylogenetic analysis of the corresponding protein sequences.

and 1 TRE) is the same as in its domesticated relative S. italica

phylogenetic trees in this work ( Fig. 1 ; Supplementary Fig. 
S3 ) were in good agreement with those published by Henry 
et al. (2014) for Tre6P-related enzymes from maize, reinforcing 
the suitability of S. viridis species as a model system for photo -
synthesis research in crops.
The expression of transcripts encoding enzymes involved in 
Tre6P metabolism in S. viridis showed a differential pattern 
among the tissues analysed in this work. Analysis of 
Tre6P-related transcripts in different tissues of S. viridis was 
not previously reported, although other works showed their 
response in leaves subjected to different treatments, including 
light ( Henry et al., 2014 , 2020 ), salt ( Henry et al., 2015 ), and 
high light and temperature ( Anderson et al., 2021 ). The 
SvTPS1 transcript and SvTPS1 protein abundance were high -
est in internode samples ( Supplementary Fig. S6 ; Fig. 3D ), 
which are rich in vascular tissue. This is in good agreement 
with data from A. thaliana, where the TPS1 protein was mainly 
detected in the vasculature of leaves, roots, and reproductive 
tissues ( Fichtner et al., 2020 ). We could not find 
Tre6P-related transcripts in the RNA-seq analysis performed 
by Martin et al. (2016) using developing internodes from S. vir -
idis, probably due to differences in the sampling procedures and 
analysis between both works. Other authors have reported that 
A. thaliana TPS1 transcripts are relatively abundant in the pro -
tovasculature of developing leaves and the shoot apical meri -
stem ( Wahl et al., 2013 ), and in differentiated phloem cells 
from the inflorescence stem ( Shi et al., 2021 ).
The transcripts encoding class II TPS proteins in S. viridis 
showed different levels according to the analysed tissue, which 
resembles data reported for class II TPS transcripts from A. 
thaliana ( Ramon et al., 2009 ). As previously mentioned, our 
analyses were performed with samples harvested in the middle 
of the light period, and thus did not capture the diurnal fluctu -
ations previously observed in A. thaliana ( Usadel et al., 2008 ) 
and maize ( Henry et al., 2014 ; Borba et al., 2023 ). The 
SvTPS3 transcript displayed high levels in seedlings and whole 
leaves ( Supplementary Fig. S6 ). The protein encoded by this 
transcript was located in a subclade exclusively containing class 
II TPS proteins from monocots, well separated from all other 
class II TPS sequences from eudicots ( Fig. 1 ). This particular 
branch contains sequences from PACMAD (S. viridis and 
maize) and BOP/BEP (wheat, rice, and B. distachyon) species, 
as well as from monocots outside the Poaceae that were included 
in our analysis (A. comosus and M. acuminata). This suggests that 
the monocot-specific class II TPS subclade arose before the di -
vergence of the orders Poales (including the Poaceae and 
Bromeliaceae) and Zingeberales (including the Musaceae). The 
SvTPS6 transcript was mainly detected in whole leaves and 
the fourth internode, while abundance of the SvTPS7 tran -
script was highest in the flag leaf and the fourth internode 
( Supplementary Fig. S6 ). The proteins encoded by these 
transcripts were located in the same subclade as A. thaliana 
TPS7 ( Fig. 1 ), whose expression was mainly detected in leaf 
primordia, cotyledons, roots (concentrated in the vasculature 
of the mature root and evenly distributed in the meristematic 
zone), and flowers (in ovules and pollen; Ramon et al., 2009 ). 
Recently, Van Leene et al. (2022) showed that all class II 
TPS proteins from A. thaliana, including TPS7, interact with 
and potentially act as regulators of the SUCROSE- 
NON-FERMENTING1-RELATED PROTEIN KINASE1 
(SnRK1). Whether these proteins play the same role in S. viridis 
and other C
4 
grasses has to be further investigated.
Transcripts encoding TPP proteins from S. viridis also 
showed a particular distribution pattern, according to the tissue 
and cell type under analysis, as previously reported for A. thali -
ana ( Vandesteene et al., 2012 ). The SvTPP2 transcript was 
mainly detected in the fourth internode, with lower but signifi -
cant levels in seedlings, whole leaves, and the inflorescence 
( Supplementary Fig. S6 ). The protein encoded by this tran -
script is the orthologue of ZmTPP4; both were located in clade 
B, which also contains RAMOSA3 (ZmTPP10; 
Supplementary Fig. S3 ). The levels of SvTPP1 were higher 
in whole leaves, the inflorescence, and the fourth internode, 
compared with other tissues, while levels of SvTPP8 were 
higher in seedlings, the flag leaf, and the fourth internode 
( Supplementary Fig. S6 ). The SvTPP1 and SvTPP8 protein se -
quences were located in clade A, which contains A. thaliana 
TPPA, TPPF, and TPPG ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). There is 
evidence of recent duplication of genes encoding A. thaliana 
clade A TPPs, associated with whole-genome duplications 
within the Brassicaceae, with a high degree of paralogue reten -
tion and evidence of neofunctionalization ( Vandesteene et al., 
2012 ). Thus, it seems feasible that the duplication and diversi -
fication of clade A S. viridis TPPs observed in Supplementary 
Fig. S3 occurred independently of those in A. thaliana 
( Kerbler et al., 2023 ).
We found that several Tre6P-related transcripts were prefer -
entially located in BSCs of S. viridis leaves ( Fig. 2 ). To compare 
our results with previously published datasets, we retrieved 
RNA-seq data from studies performed with enriched MC 
and BSC fractions from S. viridis and maize ( John et al., 
2014 ; Denton et al., 2017 ; Supplementary Table S10 ). Our 
analysis showed that the TPS1 transcript was enriched in 
BSCs from S. viridis and maize leaves ( Fig. 2B ; 
Supplementary Fig. S12 ), as previously shown for the A. thali -
ana TPS1 transcript ( Aubry et al., 2014 ). A similar analysis was 
performed by Benning et al. (2023) , who used publicly avail -
able RNA deep-sequencing data to map the distribution of 
sugar-sensing genes in leaves of C
3 
and C
4 
species; among 
these, they found that TPS1 transcripts from C
4 
species were 
mainly located in BSCs. It is important to recall that our experi -
mental data originate from samples harvested in the middle of 
the day (ZT 8 h), as TPS and TPP transcripts fluctuate during 
the diel cycle ( Usadel et al., 2008 ; Borba et al., 2023 ); in particu -
lar, the maize TPS1 transcript displayed the highest level at ZT 
Compartmentation of Tre6P metabolism in Setaria viridis | 5957
8 h ( Borba et al., 2023 ), indicating that this time of day is opti -
mal for analysing the cellular distribution of TPS1 transcripts. 
Regarding the class II TPS transcripts, the levels of SvTPS3 
and SvTPS10 were significantly higher in BSCs than in MCs 
when analysed by RT–qPCR ( Fig. 2B ); however, these pat -
terns were not the same in RNA-seq data from S. viridis and 
maize. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S12 , SvTPS9 and 
SvTPS10 displayed the highest enrichment in S. viridis BSCs, 
whereas ZmTPS11 (which clustered together with SvTPS7; 
Fig. 1 ) showed high enrichment in BSCs from almost all leaf 
segments of maize leaves. The abundance of SvTPP1 (the or -
thologue of ZmTPP6) was similar in MCs and BSCs 
( Fig. 2C ), which agrees with RNA-seq data from S. viridis 
and maize ( Supplementary Fig. S12 ). Our RT–qPCR results 
showed greater abundance of SvTPP2, SvTPP3, SvTPP7, 
and SvTPP9 in BSCs than in MCs ( Fig. 2C ), and the same 
trend was observed in the RNA-seq data from S. viridis 
( Supplementary Fig. S12 ). Similarly, ZmTPP1, ZmTPP2, 
ZmTPP7, and ZmTPP8 (the orthologues of SvTPP7, 
SvTPP3, SvTPP2, and SvTPP3, respectively; Supplementary 
Fig. S3 ) were enriched in BSCs across all fractions of the maize 
leaf, while ZmTPP4 and ZmTPP9 (the orthologues of SvTPP2 
and SvTPP5, respectively; Supplementary Fig. S3 ) were en -
riched in BSCs from the middle and the tip of the maize leaf 
(fractions 1–3, Supplementary Fig. S12 ). The levels of the 
SvTRE transcript were similar in MCs and BSCs, as reported 
in RNA-seq studies of S. viridis and maize leaves ( Fig. 2D ; 
Supplementary Fig. S12 ).
Cell-specific expression of transcripts in MCs and BSCs is 
regulated by transcriptional and post-transcriptional mecha -
nisms ( Reeves et al., 2017 ). Furthermore, due to translational 
and post-translational regulation, transcript abundance is not 
necessarily a reliable indicator of protein abundance ( Gibon 
et al., 2004 ; Wang et al., 2011 ; Reeves et al., 2017 ). Thus, we 
investigated the distribution of the SvTPS1 polypeptide in dif -
ferent tissues and cell types. Immunoblotting assays detected 
the SvTPS1 protein in whole leaves and the fourth internode 
( Fig. 3D ), as previously observed in the transcript abundance 
analysis ( Supplementary Fig. S6 ). The localization of SvTPS1 
in the BSC fraction of S. viridis leaves by immunoblotting 
( Fig. 3B, C ) is consistent with the proteomic data from 
Calace et al. (2021) , presented in Fig. 3A .
The antiserum raised against SvTPS1 consistently recog -
nized two immunoreactive protein bands, particularly in 
BSCs ( Fig. 3B, C ). The identity of the protein detected by 
the anti-SvTPS1 was confirmed by immunoprecipitation and 
MS ( Supplementary Fig. S8 ). Based on our results, we hy -
pothesized that these proteoforms of SvTPS1 may result 
from two splicing variants or a post-translational modification. 
The S. viridis genome sequence has only one annotated gene 
model for TPS1 (Sevir.3G180900.1), whereas S. italica has 
two gene models for TPS1 (Seita.3G176900.1 and 
Seita.3G176900.2), in which the alternative combination of 
the first two exons could produce proteins with different 
N-termini, with predicted molecular masses of 108.4 kDa 
and 94.9 kDa, respectively ( Supplementary Fig. S13 ). The 
Seita.3G176900.1 and Seita.3G176900.2 transcripts displayed 
a differential response to light ( Henry et al., 2020 ), suggesting 
that their encoded polypeptides could have particular biologic -
al functions. A detailed comparison of the Sevir.3G180900 and 
Seita.3G176900 DNA sequences showed eight differences, 
but only from the fifth intron towards the 3ʹ end 
( Supplementary Fig. S13 ). Therefore, an alternative transcript 
could also be produced from the Sevir.3G180900 gene. 
Regarding the existence of a putative post-translational modi -
fication, it is important to note that A. thaliana TPS1 is phos -
phorylated and potentially sumoylated ( Fichtner et al., 2020 ; 
Fichtner and Lunn, 2021 ). The phosphorylation sites found 
on the A. thaliana TPS1 are not conserved in SvTPS1, but 
the putative sumoylation site (Lys902 in A. thaliana TPS1, 
Lys919 in SvTPS1) is well conserved ( Supplementary Fig. 
S4 ; Fichtner et al., 2020 ; Fichtner and Lunn, 2021 ). 
Considering the theoretical molecular mass of SvTPS1 
(108.4 kDa) and the estimated sizes of the immunoreactive 
bands (112 kDa and 118 kDa, Fig. 3B, C ), the occurrence of 
a post-translational modification seems more plausible, as the 
two putative splicing variants of SvTPS1 should have masses 
of 108.4 kDa and 94.9 kDa, respectively ( Supplementary 
Fig. S13 ).
To confirm the immunoblotting results obtained with en -
riched fractions, we performed immunohistochemistry on 
cross-sections of S. viridis leaves. SvTPS1 was preferentially de -
tected in BSCs ( Fig. 4 ; Supplementary Fig. S9 ). We did not de -
tect any significant signal in the vascular bundle, suggesting that 
SvTPS1 is not present in this compartment. This finding rep -
resents a major difference from the observation made for A. 
thaliana TPS1, which was primarily detected in the companion 
cell–sieve element complex and, to a lesser extent, in the 
phloem parenchyma (BSC) and xylem parenchyma cells 
( Fichtner et al., 2020 ). Overall, our results show that the only 
class I TPS from S. viridis is predominantly located in BSCs, 
suggesting that this is the major location for Tre6P synthesis 
in S. viridis leaves.
We adapted a method, originally developed for maize, that 
allows metabolite analysis in MC- and BSC-enriched fractions 
( Stitt and Heldt, 1985 ). We found that the proportion of Tre6P 
was higher in BSCs than in MCs. Similar results were observed 
for pyruvate, 3PGA, and starch, as expected for an NADP-ME 
C
4 
species ( Fig. 5 ; Supplementary Tables S4–S6 ). Similarly, 
ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate and other intermediates of the 
Calvin–Benson cycle were almost exclusively located in 
BSCs ( Supplementary Table S6 ). The amount of malate was 
also higher in BSCs than in MCs. This result is counter -
intuitive, as the concentration gradient of malate is expected 
to be the opposite—a higher concentration in MCs than 
BSCs—to drive diffusion of malate from the MCs to the 
BSCs. However, it is important to consider that maize leaves 
have a large pool of malate (up to 60% of the total malate) 
5958 | Tonetti et al.
that is not actively involved in the C
4 
cycle, including a poten -
tially large pool in the vacuole ( Arrivault et al., 2017 ). Thus, 
there still might be a concentration gradient which could 
move malate from the cytosol of MCs to the cytosol of BSCs 
in S. viridis leaves, although this has to be proven, for instance 
by a combination of 
13
CO
2 
labelling and leaf fractionation, as 
previously done with maize leaves ( Arrivault et al., 2017 ). 
Two intermediates of the Calvin–Benson cycle showed con -
trasting distributions: 3PGA was predominantly located in 
BSCs, while DHAP was found mainly in MCs ( Fig. 5 ). This 
is similar to the intercellular distributions of 3PGA and 
DHAP reported for maize leaves ( Leegood, 1985 ; Stitt and 
Heldt, 1985 ; Lunn and Furbank, 1997 ; Arrivault et al., 2017 ), 
where there is intercellular shuttling of these metabolites. 
Pyruvate was also predominantly located in the BSCs, consist -
ent with its production from malate decarboxylation, via 
NADP-ME, in the BSCs, and diffusion into the MCs for con -
version to PEP via PPDK. PEP was evenly distributed between 
MCs and BSCs ( Fig. 5 ; Supplementary Table S6 ). These distri -
butions differ from those reported for maize, where PEP 
showed a preferential increase in the BSCs and pyruvate was 
located mainly in the MCs ( Arrivault et al., 2017 ). Such differ -
ences could be explained by (i) the existence of metabolic gra -
dients along the leaf, or (ii) the presence of metabolite pools 
that are not actively involved in C
4 
photosynthesis, for ex -
ample, if located in the vacuole, which could mask metabolite 
gradients between the cytosol of MCs and that of BSCs 
( Szecowka et al., 2013 ; Arrivault et al., 2017 ; Denton et al., 
2017 ).
A limitation of our study is that samples for metabolite ana -
lysis were collected from the middle section of the leaf blade at 
one defined time point in the middle of the light period, so we 
could not capture metabolic dynamics. It would be interesting 
to perform labelling studies followed by cellular enrichment to 
obtain a detailed scenario of the metabolic fluctuations that oc -
cur in S. viridis leaves. Furthermore, overall gradients between 
the MCs and BSCs might not reflect the gradients between the 
cytosol of these two cell types, if there were active transport of 
metabolites across the plastid envelope or if the pH gradient 
across the envelope membrane influences their distribution be -
tween the chloroplast stroma and the cytosol, as is known to be 
the case for 3PGA ( Fliege et al., 1978 ; Stitt et al., 1980 ). The 
relationship between the overall intercellular metabolite gradi -
ent and the gradient between the cytosols of the BSCs and MCs 
will also be affected by the relative contribution of chloroplasts 
and cytosol to cytoplasmic volume. Overall, our study indicates 
that the metabolite gradients reported in maize may not be 
generalizable and underlines the need for studies of metabolite 
gradients in other C
4 
species. Just as different biochemical sol -
utions have arisen in different species to concentrate CO
2 
into 
the BSCs ( Furbank and Kelly, 2021 ), different strategies may 
also have been followed to generate the intercellular gradients 
in the cytosol that are needed to drive metabolite movement 
between the BSCs and MCs. Overall, our fractionation data 
provide the first insights into the distributions of key photosyn -
thetic intermediates in S. viridis. These are consistent with the 
photosynthetic fluxes and intercellular metabolite movements 
that we would expect to see in an NADP-ME-type C
4 
species, 
demonstrating the reliability of this experimental approach.
The main aim of the cell fractionation experiments in our 
study was to determine the cellular localization of Tre6P. 
Our transcript and protein analyses showed that the SvTPS1 
enzyme is predominantly located in the BSCs and associated 
vascular tissues, and essentially absent from MCs ( Figs 2 – 4 ), in -
dicating that Tre6P is synthesized in BSCs but not in MCs. We 
found that ∼83% of Tre6P was present in the BSC fraction 
( Fig. 5 ) and, considering the previously mentioned limitations, 
this value could be even higher. It is worth noting that some of 
the Tre6P in the BSC fraction may be in the phloem complex 
because, although the cell separation method allows the sample 
to be enriched with BSC strands, this enrichment is partial and 
may bring with it remnants from other cell types. This would 
make sense considering that, in A. thaliana, Tre6P metabolism 
has been reported to take place in both phloem parenchyma 
(equivalent to the BSC) and in the companion cell–sieve elem -
ent complex of the phloem ( Fichtner et al., 2020 ). As previous -
ly mentioned, sucrose synthesis seems to occur in MCs of S. 
viridis leaves; however, the amount of sucrose was higher in 
the BSC fraction than in the MC fraction ( Supplementary 
Table S6 ). This result is puzzling, as sucrose levels are expected 
to be higher in the MCs than the BSCs, to drive its diffusion to 
the BSCs. We thus speculate that (i) sucrose is sequestered ei -
ther in some compartment other than the cytosol in the BSCs 
or in other cell types that are enriched in the BSC fractions; or 
(ii) that a large part of the sucrose in the leaf is in the phloem.
Lunn et al. (2006) showed there is a significant positive cor -
relation between Tre6P and sucrose levels in samples from A. 
thaliana seedlings and rosettes. The correlation between Tre6P 
and sucrose persisted even in transgenic lines expressing the E. 
coli TPS (otsA) and TPP (otsB) proteins under the control of 
the 35S promoter, although sucrose levels were markedly low -
er or higher, respectively, which led to the development of the 
Tre6P–sucrose nexus model ( Yadav et al., 2014 ). Tre6P and 
sucrose levels fluctuated during the light period in S. viridis 
leaves ( Supplementary Fig. S11 ) but, unlike A. thaliana, we 
did not observe a significant correlation at the whole-leaf level 
( Fig. 6 ). Conversely, we found a significant correlation be -
tween Tre6P and sucrose across leaf fractions containing differ -
ent proportions of MCs and BSCs ( Fig. 6 ). The Tre6P–sucrose 
nexus model postulates that Tre6P is a signal and a negative 
regulator of sucrose levels ( Yadav et al., 2014 ). According to 
this model, if sucrose levels rise too high, Tre6P rises in parallel 
and triggers mechanisms to lower the level of sucrose, either by 
reducing sucrose synthesis or by increasing its degradation or 
transport. Regarding the first alternative, research performed 
with ethanol-inducible A. thaliana transgenic lines showed 
that artificially increased Tre6P levels decreased the amount 
of sucrose by diverting newly fixed carbon to organic and 
Compartmentation of Tre6P metabolism in Setaria viridis | 5959
amino acids during the day, through the post-translational ac -
tivation of PEPC and nitrate reductase ( Figueroa et al., 2016 ). 
As previously mentioned, the initial CO
2 
fixation step in C
4 
plants is catalysed by PEPC, which is located in MCs. Our re -
sults strongly suggest that Tre6P is mainly produced and accu -
mulated in BSCs of S. viridis leaves. Thus, if the Tre6P–PEPC 
connection is operational in C
4 
species, this would imply that 
Tre6P has to diffuse from BSCs to MCs; indeed, a small 
amount of Tre6P was actually found in MCs ( Fig. 5 ). The 
asymmetrical distribution of Tre6P suggests that it could be 
sensing sucrose levels in BSCs and then acting as a signal that 
moves into the MCs to potentially modulate PEPC activity 
and/or sucrose synthesis, which is also located in MCs. The 
molecular mechanism underlying the putative transport of 
Tre6P from BSCs to MCs deserves to be further studied, but 
is beyond the scope of this work.
Another possibility is that Tre6P regulates sucrose levels by 
controlling phloem loading. TPS1 has been found in the vas -
culature of A. thaliana leaves, especially in the phloem paren -
chyma and the companion cell–sieve element complex 
( Fichtner et al., 2020 ). Tre6P has been shown to modulate 
the levels of ZmSWEET13a–c and AtSWEET11-14 transcripts 
in maize and A. thaliana, respectively, which encode sucrose 
transporters involved in phloem loading ( Oszvald et al., 2018 ; 
Fichtner et al., 2021 ). Single-cell transcriptomics in A. thaliana, 
rice, and maize showed that SWEET transcripts were preferen -
tially detected in BSCs ( Bezrutczyk et al., 2021 ; Hua et al., 
2021 ; Shi et al., 2021 ; Tao et al., 2022 ). Moreover, the 
ZmSWEET13a–c transcripts and the SWEET13a protein 
were specifically detected in the abaxial BSCs of major and 
intermediate veins from maize leaves ( Bezrutczyk et al., 
2021 ), while both SWEET13a and SWEET13b proteins 
were detected in the abaxial BSCs of intermediate veins from 
S. viridis leaves ( Chen et al., 2022 ). Based on these data, it has 
been proposed that sucrose moves from adaxial to abaxial cells 
via plasmodesmata and is then exported by SWEET13 to the 
apoplast, from where it is taken up by transporters from the 
SUT/SUC (sucrose–H
+ 
symporter) family located in the com -
panion cells ( Bezrutczyk et al., 2021 ; Chen et al., 2022 ). The 
maize zmsweet13a–c triple mutant is impaired in sugar phloem 
loading, thus producing drastic effects on growth ( Bezrutczyk 
et al., 2018 ). In S. viridis, such mutants have not yet been iden -
tified, but there is compelling evidence that it could be an apo -
plastic phloem-loading species, and thus SvSWEET13a–b might 
function in phloem loading ( Chen et al., 2022 ). Based on this 
evidence, and the fact that Tre6P metabolism is mostly located 
in BSCs, we speculate that Tre6P modulates sucrose export in 
leaves of C
4 
plants by controlling the expression, and thereby 
maximal activity, of the SWEET13 transporters, although this 
hypothesis remains to be tested. If confirmed, this would impli -
cate Tre6P in the reconfiguring of phloem loading that is a com -
mon feature of C
4 
monocots, and potentially an essential 
element in the evolution of Kranz anatomy and C
4 
photosyn -
thesis ( Furbank and Kelly, 2021 ; Rojas et al., 2023 ).
To conclude, our results indicate that Tre6P is synthesized 
and mainly located in the BSCs of S. viridis, which play a central 
role in phloem loading in C
4 
species and represent a strategic 
site at the interface between source and sink tissues. This local -
ization would allow Tre6P to monitor the levels of sucrose in 
BSCs and, via diffusion into the MCs, potentially regulate CO
2 
fixation and sucrose biosynthesis as well as sucrose export from 
the leaves ( Rojas et al., 2023 ).
