Abstract 
Rhodotorula toruloides is an oleaginous yeast recognized for its robustness and the production of high content of neutral 
lipids. Early biochemical studies have linked ATP citrate lyase (ACL), phosphoketolase (PK), and cytosolic malic enzyme 
(cMAE) with de novo lipid synthesis. In this study, we discovered that upon a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated knockout of the ACL 
gene, lipid content in R. toruloides IFO0880 decreased from 50 to 9% of its dry cell weight (DCW) in glucose medium and 
caused severe growth defects (reduced specific growth rate, changes in cell morphology). In xylose medium, the lipid content 
decreased from 43 to 38% of DCW. However, when grown on acetate as the sole carbon source, the lipid content decreased 
from 45 to 20% of DCW. Significant growth defects as a result of ACL knockout were observed on all substrates. In contrast, 
PK knockout resulted in no change in growth or lipid synthesis. Knocking out cMAE gene resulted in lipid increase of 2.9% 
of DCW and 23% increase in specific growth rate on glucose. In xylose or acetate medium, no change in lipid production as 
a result of cMAE gene knockout was observed. These results demonstrated that ACL plays a crucial role in lipid synthesis 
in R. toruloides IFO0880, as opposed to PK pathway or cMAE, whose presence in some conditions even disfavors lipid 
production. These results provided valuable information for future metabolic engineering of R. toruloides.
Key points
• ACL is crucial for the fatty acid synthesis and growth in R. toruloides IFO0880.
• Lipid production and cell growth is are unchanged as a result of PK knockout.
• Cytosolic malic enzyme does not play a significant role in lipogenesis.

Introduction
Oleaginous microorganisms are attractive for the produc-
tion of biofuels and bio-based oleochemicals from cheap 
raw materials (Probst et al. 2016; Dourou et al. 2018; Saini 
et al. 2020; Chawla et al. 2022). Red oleaginous yeast Rho-
dotorula toruloides  ( R. toruloides) is a Basidiomycota 
fungi that stands out for high lipid content, cell densities, 
and robustness in consuming hemicellulosic hydrolyzates 
(Ageitos et al. 2011; Monteiro de Oliveira et al. 2021; Oso-
rio-González et al. 2022b, 2022a); moreover, it is relatively 
mature in genetic engineering tools compared to other red 
yeasts (Chattopadhyay et al. 2021). Biotechnological appli-
cations and prospects of R. toruloides as a cell factory are 
highly promising (Zhao et al. 2022; Yu and Shi 2023; Wu 
et al. 2023; Sunder et al. 2024). Genomic, transcriptomic, 
proteomics, and flux balance analyses have established a 
basic understanding of metabolic pathways and gene func-
tions in R. toruloides (Zhu et al. 2012; Coradetti et al. 2018; 
Dinh et al. 2019 ; Tiukova et al. 2019a, 2019b; Pinheiro 
et al. 2020; Kim et al. 2021; Reķēna et al. 2023). Advanced 
genetic engineering tools have been developed in R. toru-
loides and are being constantly improved. IFO0880 is the 
best characterized haploid (mating type A2) strain natively 
producing high titers of neutral lipids up to 8 g/L, reaching 
lipid content up to 36% of the dry cell weight (DCW) (Zhang 
et al. 2016b). It is genomically different from another hap-
loid strain NP11 (mating type A1), capable of accumulating 
similar lipid titers, but significantly higher lipid content (up 
to 54% of DCW) (Zhu et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2016b, 2022).

Successful targeted gene deletion with CRISPR has been 
demonstrated in both IFO0880 and NP11 strains (Otoupal 
et al. 2019; Jiao et al. 2019; Schultz et al. 2019). The 
CRISPR/Cas9 offers a simplistic design for targeted (and 
multiplexed) genome editing (Chattopadhyay et al. 2021). 
The Cas9 enzyme introduces a double-stranded break in the 
targeted loci. Precise targeting of the Cas9 endonuclease 
can be achieved by changing a 20 nucleotide guide RNA 
(gRNA) sequence (Jinek et al. 2012). Due to lack of plasmid 
capable of replicating in R. toruloides to express CRISPR 
constructs, existing CRISPR tools in the specie are based on 
a chromosomal integration strategy—stable genome integra-
tion of Cas9 and gRNA expression cassette in the chromo-
some (Otoupal 2019). Several integration plasmids using 
a selectable drug marker cassette that encodes antibiotic 
resistance are available (Gong et al. 2024).
One of the most used strategies to enhance lipid produc-
tion in oleaginous microorganisms is by cultivating cells in 
secondary nutrient limitation (Wang et al. 2018). An effec-
tive way to achieve it is by manipulating nitrogen availability 
in the culture medium (high C/N ratio) (Papanikolaou and 
Aggelis 2011; Lopes et al. 2020), but can also be done with 
manipulating phosphate (Wu et al. 2010) or sulfur concen-
tration (Wu et al. 2011). The main reaction in biosynthesis 
of fatty acids is carried out by the multi-enzymatic complex 
of fatty acid synthetase (FAS) in the cytosol. FAS enzyme 
complex assembles acetyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA into coen-
zyme A activated fatty acids, such as palmitic acid, using 
the reducing power from NADPH (Eq. 1) (Tehlivets et al. 
2007; Papanikolaou and Aggelis 2011). This is either fol-
lowed by elongation and desaturation by dedicated enzymes 
in the endoplasmic reticulum or subsequently used for the 
acylation of glycerol backbone to synthesize neutral lipids 
(triacylglycerols, TAGs) (Tehlivets et al. 2007). Accordingly, 
FAS requires constant supply of acetyl-CoA, malonyl-CoA, 
and NADPH in cytosol (Beopoulos 2011).
Phosphoketolase (PK) (EC 4.1.2.9) is an enzyme pre-
sumed to be one of the candidates to increase acetyl-
CoA supply for de novo lipid synthesis. PK is a cytosolic 
enzyme that cleaves xylulose 5-phosphate or fructose 
6-phosphate of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) to 
two-carbon compound acetyl-phosphate and glyceralde-
hyde 3-phosphate or erythrose 4-phosphate, respectively 
(Eq. 2 and Eq. 3) (Evans and Ratledge 1984). While acetyl-
phosphate will be converted into acetate or acetyl-CoA, 
the latter two compounds can be recycled via glycolysis 
and the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), respectively. On 
glucose, the involvement of PK in the lipid synthesis was 
(1)

generally not supported by early biochemical studies with 
the wild type yeasts (Botham and Ratledge 1979; Boulton 
and Ratledge 1981). On xylose, there was a strong correla-
tion between PK activity and higher biomass yields dem-
onstrated in wild type R. toruloides CBS14 and 14 other 
yeasts (Evans and Ratledge 1984). Later, it was shown 
that with overexpression, the native or heterologous PK 
can enhance lipid production in various yeasts on hemi-
cellulosic carbon sources (Xu et al. 2016; Niehus et al. 
2018; Donzella et al. 2019; Kamineni et al. 2021). Based 
on stoichiometric genome-scale modeling, PPP has been 
demonstrated as the main glycolytic pathway in R. toru-
loides, while PK playing a crucial role in converting xylu-
lose 5-phosphate into acetyl-phosphate and glyceralde-
hyde 3-phosphate (Lopes et al. 2020; Reķēna et al. 2023). 
Omics data show that PK is abundant on glucose, xylose, 
or acetate in mineral medium (Kim et al. 2021); further -
more, it was significantly upregulated on glucose during 
lipid accumulation ( p value 0.043) (Reķēna et al. 2023). 
From the available genomic data, R. toruloides IFO0880 
possesses a single PK gene, but is not clear whether the 
conversion of acetyl-phosphate is catalyzed by phosphate 
transacetylase, also known as phosphate acetyltransferase 
(PTA) (EC 2.3.1.8) or acetate kinase (EC 2.7.2.1) (both 
reversible) (Eq. 4 and Eq. 5) (Dinh et al. 2019; Tiukova 
et al. 2019b). However, recently engineered NP11 strains 
overexpressing non-native PTA from bacterial B. subtilis  
demonstrated increased lipid production by up to 15%, 
increased glucose consumption, and cell mass (Yang et al. 
2018).
In contrast, ATP citrate lyase (ACL) (EC 2.3.3.8) was 
associated with lipid synthesis from the early biochemical 
studies, as its presence correlated to high lipid content in 
wild type yeasts (Boulton and Ratledge 1981). ACL is a 
cytosolic enzyme that cleaves cytosolic citrate to acetyl-CoA 
and oxaloacetate (OAA) (Eq. 6). According to the accepted 
mechanism for lipid synthesis, ACL activity is associated 
with the onset of nitrogen limitation that causes excess cit-
rate being exported from the mitochondria to cytosol and 
used for lipid synthesis under nitrogen limitation (Botham 
and Ratledge 1979; Boulton and Ratledge 1981). Omics data 
show that ACL is abundant on glucose, xylose, and acetate 
in various R. toruloides strains, in most of the cases reported 
as upregulated on proteome level during lipid synthesis and

being more abundant compared to PK (Tiukova et al. 2019a, 
b; Kim et al. 2021; Reķēna et al. 2023). Also the metabolic 
engineering studies have shown that ACL plays an impor -
tant role in lipid biosynthesis in Ascomycota yeasts (Liu 
et al. 2013; Zhang et al. 2014; Sato et al. 2021). In R. toru-
loides, ACL is encoded by a single gene (Zhu et al. 2012), 
while in ascomycetous yeasts and plants, it has two subu-
nits (Nowrousian et al. 2000; Fatland et al. 2002). Recently, 
engineered IFO0880 strains overexpressing the ACL gene 
demonstrated increased fatty alcohol titers (Schultz 2022, 
Cao et al. 2022). Another possible route to cytosolic acetyl-
CoA synthesis from pyruvate is via pyruvate decarboxylase 
(PDC)—acetaldehyde dehydrogenase—acetyl-CoA syn-
thetase (ACS) path. Previous proteomics studies showed 
that the abundance of PDC and ACS was low compared 
to PK and ACL (Reķēna et al. 2023) and downregulated 
twofold during lipid accumulation (Tiukova et al. 2019a, 
b); therefore, this pathway was not investigated in this study.
In line with the lipid synthesis mechanism, it was sug-
gested that ACL, FAS, and malic enzyme (MAE) (EC 
1.1.1.40) could work together by forming a complex to 
facilitate fatty acid synthesis (Ratledge 2004; Beopoulos 
et al. 2011). Because ACL catalyzes the conversion of cit-
rate into acetyl-CoA and OAA, the latter can be transformed 
into malate and further converted into pyruvate by MAE, 
simultaneously reducing NADP( +) into NADPH (Eq. 7); 
thus, MAE may also play an important role to supply of the 
reducing power for fatty acid synthesis. Several metabolic 
engineering studies confirmed the hypothesis of the role 
of MAE in filamentous fungi, like Mucor circinelloides  
(Wynn et al. 1997; Zhang et al. 2007), Mortierella alpina  
(Wynn et al. 2001), and Aspergillus nidulans (Wynn and 
Ratledge 1997), suggesting that malic enzyme was one of 
the rate-limiting steps for fatty acid synthesis. However 
in similar studies with the oleaginous ascomycetous yeast 
Yarrowia lipolytica and basidiomycetous yeast Rhodoto-
rula glutinis, it did not perform the same way (Yoon et al. 
1984; Zhang et al. 2013; Blazeck et al. 2014; Wasylenko 
et al. 2015; Dulermo et al. 2015; Qiao et al. 2017; Zhu 
et al. 2023). Namely, it resulted in a current understand-
ing that oleaginous yeasts are different from filamentous 
fungi, and the primary sources of cytosolic NADPH are 
glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD, also known 
as ZWF) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase of the 
PPP, and isocitrate dehydrogenase (Chawla et al. 2022; 
Sreeharsha and Mohan 2020; Yang et al. 2012; this study), 
an alternative route being via cytosolic malic enzyme only 
while growing on substrates that are not catabolized via 
glycolytic pathways. Both ZWF and MAE are abundant 
in R. toruloides in mineral medium on glucose, xylose, 
or acetate, but the results of their differential expression 
(6)Citrate+ CoA + ATP → AcetylCoA + Oxaloacetate+ ADP + Pi
during lipid synthesis are inconclusive among the studies 
(Tiukova et al. 2019a , b; Kim et al. 2021; Reķēna et al. 
2023). The observed higher abundance of oxPPP enzymes 
suggests their primary role in NADPH regeneration, but it 
was not investigated further due to report on gene essenti-
ality from a previous study (Coradetti et al. 2018). Moreo-
ver, the deletion of MAE would tell if the other pathway 
prevailed, as these are the two main candidate pathways 
for the regeneration of NADPH in R. toruloides. It should 
be noted that Y. lipolytica  possesses only a mitochondrial 
MAE (mMAE), while R. toruloides holds both cytosolic 
and mitochondrial forms of MAE (Zhu et al. 2012; Cora-
detti et al. 2018). Engineered IFO0880 strains overexpress-
ing native cytosolic MAE (cMAE) enzyme demonstrated a 
minor increase in lipid synthesis on glucose (Zhang et al. 
2016a). A heterologous overexpression of MAE from Y. 
lipolytica did not increase the expression of fatty alcohols 
in R. toruloides IFO0880 (Schultz et al. 2022). The role and 
cofactor dependency of the R. toruloides mMAE form still 
remains unclear. mMAE was not investigated in this study.
Taken altogether, to clarify whether PK, ACL, and 
cMAE contributes to the lipid biosynthesis in R. toruloides, 
the latest CRISPR/Cas9 tool was used for a targeted sin-
gle gene knockout of PK, ACL, and cMAE in a wild type 
IFO0880. Cell growth and lipid production in the knock -
out strains were examined. To understand the substrate-
dependent differences, the knockouts were characterized in 
a chemically defined medium at nitrogen limitation (C/N 
80) on glucose, xylose, and acetic acid as a sole carbon 
sources. The study revealed very different physiological 
responses between these genes and lipid synthesis, provid-
ing valuable insights in R. toruloides metabolism, building 
understanding relevant for the future metabolic engineering. 
ACL knockout strain demonstrated the most severe effect 
on the growth and lipid production on all the characterized 
substrates while ΔPK and ΔcMAE strains demonstrated 
less severe physiology differences in comparison to the wild 
type strain. This is the first study of these gene knockouts 
in R. toruloides.

Lipid content was measured in cells grown in a low-
nitrogen mineral medium. Basal medium contained 3.0 g/L 
 KH2PO4, 0.5 g/L  MgSO4·7H2O, 15 mg/L EDTA, 4.5 mg/L 
 ZnSO4⋅7H2O, 0.3 mg/L  CoCl2⋅6H2O, 1 mg/L  MnCl2⋅4H2O, 
0.3 mg/L  CuSO4⋅5H2O, 4.5 mg/L  CaCl2⋅2H2O, 3 mg/L 
 FeSO4⋅7H2O, 0.4 mg/L  Na2MoO4⋅2H2O, 1 mg/L  H3BO3, 
0.1 mg/L KI, 0.05 mg/L biotin, 1 mg/L calcium panto-
thenate, 1 mg/L nicotinic acid, 25 mg/L inositol, 1 mg/L 
thiamine HCl, 1 mg/L pyridoxine HCl, and 0.2 mg/L para-
aminobenzoic acid (Verduyn et al. 1992). Basal medium was 
supplemented with 20 g/L glucose (Roth), or 20 g/L xylose, 
or 10 g/L acetate (Chempur) as a sole carbon source. Ammo-
nium sulfate  (NH4)2SO4 was used as a nitrogen source to 
obtain a C/N ratio of 80 (mol/mol); 0.55 g/L of  (NH4)2SO4 
(Fisher Bioreagents) was added to the medium containing 
glucose or xylose, and 0.275 g/L  (NH4)2SO4 was added to 
the medium containing acetate. For adjusting the media 
containing glucose or xylose, 5.2 g/L  K2HPO4 (Roth) was 
added (pH 5.8 to 8.0). The potassium phosphate buffer did 
not sustain the pH with 10 g/L of acetate in the medium; 
therefore, instead, it was adjusted to a starting pH 6 with 
2 M KOH (Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Escherichia coli strain TOP10 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 
was used for plasmid assembly and routine cloning. The 
strain and its derivatives were grown in Luria Broth (LB) 
medium at 37 ℃ and 200 rpm with 50 µg/mL kanamycin.
Unless differently stated, all other reagents were pur -
chased from Sigma-Aldrich Co., St Louis, MO, USA.
DNA sequences
DNA sequences of R. toruloides IFO0880 strain were 
obtained from MycoCosm database (R. toruloides v4.0) 
(JGI) (Coradetti et al. 2018). Genes with accession num -
bers 9725 (ATP citrate lyase, ACL) and 13,382 (phospho-
ketolase, PK) were retrieved and used to design the guide 
RNAs, as there were no other alternative genes with a simi-
lar sequence. Based on the annotation found from the two 
existing genome-scale models, gene with accession number 
12761 was retrieved and used to design gRNAs to target the 
cytosolic, NADP-dependent malic enzyme (cMAE) (Tiuk -
ova et al. 2019b; Kim et al. 2021). The single gRNAs target-
ing the first exon 1 of ORF of the target gene (exon 5 in case 
of the ACL gene) were designed with the CCTop online tool 
using Ganoderma lucidum as the reference genome (Stem-
mer et al. 2015). 23-nucleotide target sequence ending with 
NGG (Streptococcus pyogenes ) and set custom overhangs 
(forward strand 5′ CGCA and reverse strand 5′ AAAC) was 
selected based on the CRISPRater efficacy score (Labuhn 
et al. 2018) above 74 (high efficacy).
Oligonucleotides without the NGG 3-mer (20-nucleotide 
target sequence + overhangs) were synthesized by IDT (Inte-
grated DNA Technologies, Leuven, the Netherlands).
Guide RNA cloning
The plasmid pPBO.202 for CRISPR/Cas9-mediated genome 
editing of R. toruloides IFO0880 was obtained from the JBEI 
Registry   https:// regis try. jbei. org/ (part ID JBEI223791). 
pPBO.202 contained constructs for a functional expres-
sion of the CRISPR/Cas9 system in R. toruloides. They 
were optimized by Otoupal and colleagues (Otoupal et al. 
2019) to be as follows: (i) E. coli elements of ColE1 (KanR 
promoter, kanamycin resistance), (ii) a gRNA expression 
cassette with R. toruloides fusion 5S rRNA-tRNA Phe pro-
moter, 2 BsaI sites, the S. cerevisiae SUP4 terminator, (iii) a 
codon optimized SpCas9 expression cassette with IFO0880 
GPD1 promoter and NOS terminator, and (iv) R. toruloides 
G418 resistance cassette pTUB2-G418-tTUB2. Two oli-
gos with a forward strand 5′  CGCA and reverse strand 5′ 
AAAC overhang were annealed and subsequently cloned 
by digesting plasmid pPBO.202 with BsaI (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) and ligating in T4 Ligase buffer (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) in a single pot reaction. Plasmid cloning was per-
formed in Escherichia coli strain TOP10 (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and 
bacterial plasmid DNA was purified using FavorPrep Mini 
Plasmid Kit (FAVORGEN, Ping Tung, Taiwan). Resulting 
plasmids pPBO.202–13382(3), pPBO.202–9725(1), and 
pPBO.202–12761(1) were checked by Sanger sequenc-
ing. Several different gRNAs per target gene were tested in 
sequential order if the previous gRNA candidate failed to 
result in the target site disruption (the number in the brack -
ets next to each construct indicates the number of different 
gRNA test candidates that resulted in a functional CRISPR/
Cas9 mediated target site disruption).
Yeast transformation
Yeast transformation was performed using lithium acetate/
PEG-mediated chemical transformation method as pre-
viously described (Tsai et al. 2017; Bonturi et al. 2022). 
Briefly, cells from an overnight YPD culture were inoculated 
at  OD600 0.2 in a shake flask containing 50 mL of YPD 
(for up to 10 transformations). At  OD600 0.8, cells were 
harvested, washed in  dH2O, and eventually mixed with 240 
μL PEG 4000 (Fisher Scientific), 36 μL 1 M LiAc pH 7.5 
(Alfa Aesar), 24 μL  dH2O, 10 μL pre-boiled Salmon Sperm 
(10 mg/mL), and 0.1–10 μg purified circular plasmid DNA 
dissolved in 50 μL of water. The mixture was incubated at 
30 ℃ shaking for 30 min, added with 34 μL of DMSO and 
heat shocked at 42 ℃ for 15 min. After removing the super-
natant, collected cells were resuspended in 2 mL of YPD 
and incubated at 30 ℃ overnight for the recovery. Then, cells 
were collected, spread on YPD agar plates (agar 20 g/L) the 
selective antibiotic 200 µg/mL G418, and incubated at 30 ℃ 
for 2–4 days until the colonies appeared.

Isolation of gene knockouts
Multi-step verification was used to confirm target gene 
inactivation: (i) antibiotic selection, (ii) genomic DNA iso-
lation using lithium acetate/SDS/heat lysis (Lõoke et al. 
2011) and Cas9-specific PCR on the genomic DNA, (iii) 
target gene PCR amplification and sequencing. PCR ampli-
fication at the target locus of PK was performed with prim-
ers 5′ CCT CCC TCT CAC TCT TGC AC ′3 (forward) and 5′ 
CAC GCT GTC CAG TCA AAG AA ′3 (reverse); ACL—with 
primers 5′  AGC TCC TCA AGC ACG TCA CT ′3 (forward) 
and 5′ GTA GAC GAC CGA AGC ACC AC ′3 (reverse), and 
MAE—with primers 5′  ACT CGC TCT CCC TCT CTC TC 
′3 (forward) and 5′  ACT  CGG AAA ACC ACG GCT TC ′3 
(reverse). It was performed using high-fidelity Platinum 
SuperFi II DNA Polymerase Green PCR Master Mix (2X) 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Vilnius, Lithuania) accord-
ing to manufacturer’s instructions for a high GC content 
template. PCR amplification of the Cas9 coding sequence 
with primers 5′  GGA GTC GCG GGA CGC CAA C ′3 (for -
ward) and 5′  ACA CGT TGG CGT CCC GCG A ′3 (reverse) 
was performed using DreamTaq Polymerase Green PCR 
Master Mix (2x) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Vilnius, Lithu-
ania). PCR DNA was purified using FavorPrep Mini Gel/
PCR Kit (FAVORGEN, Ping Tung, Taiwan).
Physiological characterization
The seed culture from a fresh YPD agar plate was inocu -
lated to a sterile 250-mL baffled Erlenmeyer flask filled with 
25 mL of YPD. After 19 h at 30 ℃ and 200 rpm, sufficient 
amount of broth was transferred to a sterile 50 mL Falcon 
tube and pelleted (5000 g, 5′). After discard of supernatant, 
cell pellet was washed twice with a sterile dH2O and used to 
inoculate 10 mL of low-nitrogen mineral medium at  OD600 
of 0.5 in aerobic 50 mL Biosan RTS-8 Multi-channel falcon 
tube bioreactors (Biosan, Riga, Latvia). Calibration curves 
for OD quantification were prepared in a range between 
 OD600 0 and 55 with 8 calibration points using R. toru-
loides shake flask culture in a chemically defined medium. 
Calibration curves for pH and dO measurement were set 
up according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Real-time 
logging was set to every 30 min with RTS-8 proprietary 
software. Agitation speed was set to 2500 rpm, temperature 
30 ℃. Every 12 h after the cells had reached the exponential 
growth phase, except for the first sample after time point 
zero, samples to measure offline  OD600 and extracellular 
metabolites were withdrawn from the bioreactor tube in the 
laminar flow cabinet, transferred to a 2-mL Eppendorf tubes 
and centrifuged for 5 ′ at 11,000  × g. The supernatant was 
collected and stored at − 20 ℃ for further analysis. The first 
sample was collected 6 h after inoculation. All cultivations 
were carried out in a batch regime; no feed was added 
throughout the process. All samples were collected from 
three independent replicates for each experimental condi -
tion, i.e., combination of strain and carbon source. Specific 
growth rate was calculated by fitting an exponential trend

Lipid analysis
At the end of the cultivation experiment, cell broth contain-
ing at least 12 mg of DCW was transferred from the falcon 
tube bioreactor to a 15 mL tube and separated by centrifuga-
tion (5000 g, 10′, 4 ℃). Cell pellets were frozen at − 80 ℃, 
lyophilized, and stored at − 20 ℃ until further analysis. To 
quantify lipids, fatty acids were extracted and derivatized by 
using one-step method as described by Sukhija and Palmquist 
(Sukhija and Palmquist 1988), with internal standard hepta-
decanoic acid (17:0) solution in toluene (5 mg/mL). Fatty 
acids were analyzed using Agilent (Santa Clara, CA, USA) 
6890 A gas chromatograph equipped with a flame ioniza-
tion detector (GC-FID). The column was a quartz capillary 
column (100 m × 0.25 mm) with liquid phase CP-Sil 88, 
temperature programmed from 70 to 180 ℃  at 13 ℃/min, 
held for 40 min, 180 to 225 ℃ at 5 ℃/min, held for 15 min. 
Hydrogen was used as the carrier gas for GC and FID (FID 
flow rate 30 mL/min), air flow rate 300 mL/min. Fatty acids 
were identified by comparison of their retention times with 
the retention time of mixtures with known fatty acid methyl 
ester composition and concentration: Supelco 37 Component 
FAME Mix (Sigma-Aldrich Co., St Louis, MO, USA), Nu-
Chek Prep CLC 603, and Nu-Chek Prep CLC 428 (Nu-Chek 
Prep Inc., Elysian, MN, USA). Fatty acid composition was 
presented as a gram of individual fatty acids per 100 g of 
total fatty acids (the same as relative %). Lipid content was 
calculated as the weight sum of individual fatty acids in 100 g 
of sample, divided by 0.9 to provide TAG equivalent known 
from earlier biochemical studies, as described by Sukhija and 
Palmquist (1988), and expressed as gram lipids per gram dry 
cell weight (DCW). Non-lipid cell mass was calculated after 
subtraction of intracellular lipids from cell mass.
Analytical methods
Extracellular metabolites in cultivation broth were measured 
using HPLC (LC-2050C, Shimazu, Kyoto, Japan) equipped 
with a refractive index detector and a variable wavelength 
(8)OD (t)= OD 0 × e/u1D707t

detector. Prior analysis, all samples were thawed, filtered 
(0.22 μm), and diluted in an appropriate diluent as indicated 
below. Metabolites were analyzed using the Aminex HPX-
87H 300 × 7.8 mm column (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) 
at 45 ℃, with 5 mM  H2SO4 as the mobile phase with iso-
cratic elution at 0.6 mL/min. The concentrations of acetate, 
glucose, glycerol, xylose, citrate, xylitol, and D-arabitol 
were quantified by refractive index detector based on the 
calibration curves prepared in the range between 0.625 and 
20 g/L. No unknown peaks by variable wavelength detector 
set at 210 nm were detected. It should be noted that with 
the HPX-87H, it is not possible to determine the chirality 
of arabitol, but we have determined it in our previous pub-
lication (Reķēna et al. 2023). To adjust the sample volume, 
samples containing glucose or xylose were diluted to 5X 
in ultrapure  H2O (Milli-Q Ultrapure Water System, Merck, 
Darmstadt, Germany). To adjust the pH and the volume, 
samples containing acetate were diluted to 5X in 10 mM 
mobile phase to reduce the pH below 8, the maximum range 
of the column. Biomass optical density data were calibrated 
by gravimetric dry cellular mass measurements. The lin-
early fitted calibration coefficient was 0.3 for cells under 
the exponential growth and 0.26 for cells under nitrogen 
limitation. At the end of cultivation, 3 uL of culture were 
transferred to a glass slide for microscopy. Cells from an 
undiluted culture were visualized by a bright-field micro-
scope under 100 × magnification CX21 (Olympus, Tokyo, 
Japan). All images were acquired using Apple iPhone 13 
mini (Apple Inc., Cupertino, CA, USA).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analysis of physiological parameters evaluation 
was performed using GraphPad Prism 9.5.1 (GraphPad Soft-
ware Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Statistical significance was 
calculated using one-way ANOVA (Analysis of variance) at 
0.05 significance level. p -values were adjusted (apval) for 
multiplicity following Dunnett multiple comparison testing 
against the wild type IFO0880.
Results
Sequencing of the genomic DNA confirmed gene 
knockouts introduced by CRISPR/Cas9
Gene knockouts were introduced into the R. toruloides  
IFO0880 genome by using a one-step CRISPR/Cas9 strat-
egy. The coding sequence of the Cas9 and appropriate 
gRNAs were randomly integrated into the genome through 
use of a single plasmid vector pPBO.202 (JBEI Registry 
part ID JBEI223791) with the G418 selection marker using 
lithium acetate/PEG-mediated chemical transformation (see 
“Materials and Methods”). A set of single guide RNAs tar -
geting PK, ACL, or cMAE were designed to separately tar-
get and disrupt the first exon of the targeted genes (Table 1). 
Gene knockouts by CRISPR/Cas9 were confirmed by 
sequencing of the genomic DNA around the gRNA-targeted 
cut site. Mutations at the site targeted by the gRNAs were 
identified by aligning sequences against the wild type R. 
toruloides IFO0880 reference genome (Fig.  1a). In case of 
ACL knockout, there was a visible phenotypic difference 
(Fig. 1b). Other knockouts did not display a phenotypic dif-
ference. The gene knockouts by CRISPR/Cas9 were presum-
ably generated by sequence of Cas9 endonuclease and error 
prone NHEJ DNA repair resulting in frameshift mutation in 
wild type R. toruloides strain. It has been reported that the 
frequency of HR in R. toruloides  is low (Koh et al. 2014). 
List of strains used in this study is provided in Table  2; 
number of clones screened is reported in Supplementary 
Table S1.
During the strain characterization step, growth curves 
(in the next section) of wild type cells and cells harboring 
gene editing vector did not show difference in growth rates. 
No significant differences in growth rates were observed 
between different mutation variants of cMAE and PK dur -
ing initial screening. This shows that cassette did not cause 
detrimental fitness effects, similarly as reported by Otoupal 
and colleagues (Otoupal et al. 2019). These results demon-
strated that it is possible to achieve the disruption of central 
carbon metabolism genes with a method that relies on a sta-
ble genome integration of CRISPR constructs in the genome 
using a selectable drug marker.
ACL knockout decreases lipid synthesis on glucose
To understand the role of PK, ACL, and cMAE in the lipid 
synthesis of R. toruloides IFO0880 strain, we compared the 
lipid content produced by the knockout strains versus the 
wild type IFO0880. Cells were induced for lipid produc-
tion using low-nitrogen mineral medium containing glucose, 
xylose, or acetate as a solo carbon source. R. toruloides is 
an obligate aerobe. For the best mixing and aeration sup-
port, high-throughput falcon tube bioreactors equipped with 
a reverse-SpinⓇ technology RTS-8 (Biosan, Riga, Latvia) 
instead of shaker flasks or traditional stirred tank bioreactors

were used for strain characterization. This system was not 
equipped with the option to maintain desired pH and dis-
solved oxygen settings, but provided for a real time non-
invasive tracking of OD, pH, and dissolved oxygen data. 
We used real-time dissolved oxygen monitoring to precisely 
track the end of the experiment. To account for the pH drop 
happening with R. toruloides in an uncontrolled pH environ-
ment (Tingajeva 2024),  K2HPO4 was added in the starting 
media at pH 6.5 to an amount sufficient to buffer significant 
pH changes (see “Materials and Methods”).
On glucose, online  OD600 data showed no difference 
among the strains in the lag phase prior to the exponential 
growth phase (Fig.  2a), but the maximum specific growth 
rate of the ACL knockout was significantly decreased by 
41% as compared to the wild type strain (Fig.  2b, Supple-
mentary Table S2, apval < 0.002). The growth of the ACL 
mutant continued until 18 h, but then the growth stopped and 
final DCW did not reach that of the wild type strain (Fig. 2c). 
Sugar analysis confirmed that the ΔACL stopped consuming 
glucose after 18 h (Fig.  2d). The pH remained within the 
optimal range throughout the cultivation (Supplementary 
Fig. S1). The dissolved oxygen curves showing when the 
end of the experiment was declared are available from Sup-
plementary Fig. S2.
For lipid quantification, we used gas chromatographic 
(GC) determination (see “Materials and Methods”). In the 
wild type strain, lipid content reached 50.18 ± 0.37% (g lipid 
per g of DCW) after 54 h of growth on low-nitrogen mineral 
media (Table  3). The ACL knockout strain showed a sig -
nificant decrease in lipid content by 81% compared to the 
wild type strain, reaching only 9.43  ± 0.039% (glipid/gDCW) 
(Fig. 2e, apval < 0.0001). In case of the ACL knockout, the 
difference in non-lipid DCW (g/L) compared to the wild 
type strain was 58% (apval < 0.0001) (Supplementary 
Fig. S3a). These results indicated that ACL was not only 
essentially involved in R. toruloides  fatty acid synthesis, 
similarly as previously studied in Y. lipolytica and L. star -
keyi (Dulermo et al. 2015; Liu et al. 2013; Sato et al. 2021), 
but also involved in some other essential processes that had 
a complementary effect on cellular physiology, whereas 
knocking out the PK gene showed no change in specific 
growth rate or lipid content, suggesting PK had no major

effect on growth or lipid synthesis under the studied envi-
ronmental conditions (Fig.  2a–f). In contrast, the specific 
growth rate of ΔcMAE was increased by 23% compared to 
the wild type strain, reaching 0.39 ± 0.030  h−1 (Fig. 2b, apval 
0.04). Lipid content of ΔcMAE increased by 2.9% of DCW 
compared to the wild type strain (apval 0.03), but no signifi-
cant changes in the fatty acid profile were observed (Fig. 2e). 
These results indicated that cMAE in R. toruloides is not 
essential in lipid biosynthesis under the studied environmen-
tal conditions. Previously, it was reported in oleaginous Y. 
lipolytica that the deletion of mMAE in the wild type strain 
has no effect on lipid content or fatty acid profiles (Blazeck 
et al. 2014; Dulermo et al. 2015; Zhu et al. 2023). However, 
only the deletion of cMAE was studied in the present work.
The fatty acid composition of the wild type R. toru-
loides  IFO0880 was C16:0 22.67% and C18:1 45.62% 
 (gFA/gtotalFA ) (Table  3), closely similar to as previously 
reported (Ratledge and Wynn 2002). In fact, our results 
were closely similar to the R. glutinis strain, which has 
more recently been designated as R. toruloides, and 
according to Zhang et al. may even be IFO0880 (Zhang 
et al. 2016b). The knockout of the ACL caused changes in 
the fatty acid composition. We observed a relative increase 
in polyunsaturated fatty acids (C18:2 and C18:3) of 34% 
of total fatty acids when compared to the wild type strain 
(gFA/gtotalFA ) (Fig.  2f). In the ACL knockout, the frac -
tion of oleic acid (C18:1) decreased significantly com-
pared to the wild type strain and constituted only 19.47% 
(pval < 0.0001), while linoleic acid (C18:2) increased 
significantly compared to the wild type and became the 
largest fraction with 29.46% (pval < 0.0001), followed 
by 17.78% of alpha-linoleic acid (C18:3) (Table  3, 
pval < 0.0001). Similar observations were reported in Y. 
lipolytica (Dulermo et al. 2015). It should be noted, how -
ever, that when calculated per DCW, the total quantities 
of all measured fractions decreased compared to the wild 
type strain (Supplementary Table S3).
Yeasts and filamentous fungi undergo morphological dif-
ferentiations when triggered by extracellular stimuli such as 
nutrient limitation. Therefore, we examined cells harvested 
at the end of the experiment under the microscope. We 
observed that the majority of strains, including the wild type, 
had adopted linear chain morphology (Fig. 2g), notably dif-
ferent from their typical oval-shaped unicellular form (Sup-
plementary Fig. S4). Similar morphological appearance, 
also known as pseudohyphae formation, has been observed 
at slow growth rates below 0.1   h−1 in glucose-limited che-
mostats of the non-conventional yeast Komagataella phaffii 
(Rebnegger et al. 2014) and S. cerevisiae under the nitro-
gen limitation (Gimeno et al. 1992). However, as a result

of the knockout of the ACL gene, cells did not form these 
filament-like structures (Fig. 2g), instead their morphology 
looked very similar to that during the exponential growth 
phase (Supplementary Fig. S4), in a good agreement with 
the above analysis that the loss of ACL indeed deprived cells 
from consuming carbon under nitrogen limitation.
Xylose as a carbon source modifies the cellular 
response to ACL loss
R. toruloides can consume xylose as a sole carbon source 
(Pinheiro et al. 2020). DCW of 18 (g/L) on xylose as a car -
bon source was comparable to the one grown on glucose, 22 
(g/L), but the DCW yield on substrate (g DCW/gsubstrate) even 

Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology          (2025) 109:77

outperformed glucose (Pinheiro et al. 2020). Xylose is a rel-
evant substrate of R. toruloides that has been less explored; 
therefore, we cultivated ΔPK, ΔACL, and ΔcMAE strains 
in the low-nitrogen pH-adjusted chemically defined medium, 
but this time containing xylose as a sole carbon source. All 
strains demonstrated slightly different lag phases, but the 
ACL knockout exhibited the shortest lag phase and the low-
est specific growth rate compared to the wild type strain 
(Fig. 3a, Supplementary Table S2). The specific growth rate 
(μ) was 45% of the wild type strain (Fig. 3b, apval < 0.001). 
Nevertheless, ACL knockout reached even a significantly 
higher final DCW titer as compared to the wild type strain 
(Fig. 3c, Supplementary Fig. S3, b, apval < 0.01) and con-
sumed xylose until depletion (Fig. 3d). The non-lipid DCW 
titers of the ACL knockout were higher compared to the wild 
type strain (apval < 0.01), suggesting that ACL was involved 
in other cellular processes apart from lipid synthesis (Sup-
plementary Fig. S3b). Lipid content of the wild type strain 
was 42.61 ± 0.84% (glipid/gDCW) after 90 h of growth on low-
nitrogen mineral medium (Table  4), but the ACL knockout 
gave significantly lower, 37.71 ± 3.01% (glipid/gDCW) (Fig. 3e, 
apval 0.02), with no major changes in the fatty acid profiles 
(Fig. 3f, Table 4). Linear chain pseudohyphal growth was 
unchanged compared to the glucose medium. Chain-like 
pseudohyphal growth was observed for all strains, except 
for the ACL knockout (Fig. 3g). The knockout of the cMAE 
gene did not have an effect on growth or lipid synthesis on 
medium containing xylose as a carbon source (Fig.  3a–f).
Altogether, these results indicated that R. toruloides  
IFO0880 is less reliant on ACL than assumed, which sug -
gests an alternative source of cytosolic acetyl-CoA on 
xylose as sole carbon source. It cannot be ruled out that 
the PK replaced ACL for the supply of acetyl-CoA upon 
the ACL knockout, but on the other hand, the knockout of 
the PK gene alone did not give any change in the specific 
growth rate or lipid content (Fig.  3a–f). We speculate that 
one of the options for the cytosolic acetyl-CoA synthesis 
could be the pyruvate-acetaldehyde-acetate pathway, also 
known as “pyruvate dehydrogenase bypass.” Despite low 
protein expression levels of ACS on glucose and xylose, it 
was previously reported higher abundant on xylose during 
the exponential growth (p value 0.038) and lipid accumula-
tion phase (p value 0.49) compared to glucose-grown cells 
(Reķēna et al. 2023).

basidiomycetous yeast C. neoformans, the knockout of 
the ACL1 gene caused growth defects on glucose, but no 
effect during growth on acetate (Griffiths et al. 2012). In 
oleaginous ascomycetous yeast L. starkeyi, a knockout of 
both ACL1 and ACL2 gene resulted in restored growth on 
acetate, but TAG productivity was lower than that of the 
control using acetate with glucose (Sato et al. 2021). In 
accordance with these reports, we cultivated ΔPK, ΔACL, 
ΔcMAE strains, and IFO0880 in low-nitrogen chemically

initial medium pH was adjusted to 6 by adding KOH and 
was not maintained. During the cultivation, the pH in all 
cultures rose equally, as the cells started growing, and 
reached pH 9 at the end of cultivation (Supplementary

Fig. S1). The growth of ΔACL was extremely delayed as 
compared to the other strains (Fig.  4a), and the maximum 
specific growth rate was reduced by 40% in compari-
son to wild type strain (Fig.  4b, apval 0.009), falling to 
0.10 ± 0.0047   h−1 (Supplementary Table S2). The ACL 
knockout started growing only at 60 h and 6 h after that 
started to produce slight amounts of citrate, a substrate 
for ACL (Fig.  4c). Although the analysis showed a con-
sistent, slow consumption of acetate after 66 h, ΔACL 
cells stopped respiring before all the acetate was depleted 
around 126 h (Fig.  4d, Supplementary Fig. S1). Other 
strains consumed the substrate completely with no vis -
ible disturbance to the growth rates. These results dem-
onstrated that R. toruloides responded similarly to ACL 
loss compared to glucose medium, and acetate did not 
restore the growth defects caused by ACL loss. It was in 
contrast to findings by Hynes and Murray, in which the 
authors concluded that external sources of cytoplasmic 
acetyl-CoA result in repression of ACL (Hynes and Mur -
ray 2010). The loss of ACL caused 56% reduction in lipids 
(glipid /gDCW) (Fig.  4e, apval < 0.0001) and alterations in 
fatty acid profiles (Fig.  4f). On acetate, ACL loss did not 
result in significant changes to non-lipid DCW (Supple-
mentary Fig. S3c), indicating that the effect was directly 
on lipid synthesis and not beyond as in case of the glu-
cose-grown cells. The majority fatty acid fraction, C18:1, 
decreased relatively from 46 to 33% (g FA/gtotalFA ), while 
C18:2 and C18:3 increased relatively to 20% and 8%, 
respectively, 20% of C18:2 and 8% of C18:3 (g FA/gtotalFA) 
(Table  5). These results were similar to the L. starkeyi  
study, in which the TAG productivity of the ACL knockout 
strain was significantly lower compared to the reference 
strain on medium containing glucose and acetate (Sato 
et al. 2021). It also indicated that acetate must be con-
verted into citrate for its assimilation, which is possible if 
mitochondrial malate-oxoglutarate and oxoglutarate/citrate 
shuttling takes place.
cMAE knockout gave a 19% decrease in the specific 
growth rate, falling to 0.14 ± 0.0091  h−1 (apval 0.009), even 
though it did not affect the lipid content (Table  5). These 
results suggested that cMAE is not involved in lipogenesis 
on acetate. Consistent with the above results, the knockout 
of the PK gene caused no change in growth or lipid synthesis 
(Fig. 4a–f).
Growth on acetate induced differences in cell morphology 
in this experiment. Cells formed less chain-like structures 
compared to glucose or xylose-grown cells, even though 
they were under nutrient starvation (Fig. 4g).
Discussion
R. toruloides is an emerging oleaginous cell factory for the 
production of fats, oils, and oleochemicals. The metabolic 
mechanisms of lipid production in R. toruloides are less 
understood compared to other oleaginous fungi M. circinel-
loides or M. alpina, oleaginous yeast Y. lipolytica, or model 
yeast S. cerevisiae. Due to the development of gene editing 
tools (Otoupal et al. 2019; Liu et al. 2019; Jiao et al. 2019; 
Schultz et al. 2019), the possibilities for functional genomics 
studies are significantly improved. In this study, we applied 
CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system to elucidate the role 
of PK pathway, ACL, and cMAE in lipid biosynthesis of R. 
toruloides IFO0880 by creating gene knockouts and charac-
terizing them on alternative carbon sources.
The results of this study demonstrated that ACL is crucial 
for not only the fatty acid synthesis but also for growth in 
R. toruloides. Loss of ACL reduced lipid content by 81% 
of DCW compared to the wild type strain on glucose, 11% 
on xylose and 56% on acetate (Figs.  2, 3, and 4 ). It also 
significantly reduced the specific growth rate on all carbon 
sources. Although previous studies have reported growth 
defects as a result of ACL inactivation in A. niger, A. nidu-
lans, S. macrospora, and Y. lipolytica (Nowrousian et al. 
1999; Hynes and Murray 2010; Chen et al. 2014; Dulermo 
et al. 2015), the present study revealed a difference to Y. lipo-
lytica. ACL knockout resulted in a growth arrest on glucose 
and on acetate once nitrogen is depleted, as demonstrated 
by a significantly lower cell density compared to the refer -
ence strain by the end of experiment (see Figs. 2 and 4). On 
glucose, it could not have been caused by the pH changes, 
because it remained within the optimal range (pH 5.5–7.0) 
throughout cultivation (Supplementary Fig. S1). Currently, 
there is not enough evidence to provide a single explanation

to our observations. Lowered acetyl-CoA in cytoplasm 
impairs the synthesis of signaling molecules and second -
ary metabolites leading to developmental effects (Hynes 
and Murray 2010). In yeast, acetyl-CoA is localized in four 
different compartments, and nuclear acetyl-CoA is required 
for histone acetylation (Takahashi et al. 2006; Pietrocola 
et al. 2015). Recently, the role of ACL in supplying acetyl-
CoA for histone acetylation to promote proliferation was 
demonstrated in myeloid cells (Rhee et al. 2019). Another 
consequence of the ACL knockout is likely impaired citrate 
conversion to cytosolic acetyl CoA that probably leads to cit-
rate oxidation in mitochondria and an increased flux through 
the TCA cycle increasing the production of substrates for the 
electron transport chain, which was confirmed by proving 
elevated mitochondrial membrane potential between control 
and ACL knockdown cells in hematopoietic murine cells 
(Board and Newsholme 1996; Bauer et al. 2005). It is in line 
with the detected extracellular citrate on acetate (Fig.  4c). 
In this study, we also observed an effect on cell morphol-
ogy during nitrogen limitation. In S. cerevisiae, it has been 
investigated that pseudohyphal growth is regulated by two 
different signaling pathways, the MAP kinase cascade and 
cAMP-dependent pathway (Gancedo 2001). In mamma-
lian cells, ACL is hierarchically regulated through cAMP-
dependent phosphorylation (Pierce et al. 1981; Pant et al. 
2023). The observed morphological changes, growth arrest 
during nitrogen starvation, and the drop in lipid production 
that were all associated with the ACL loss suggest a complex 
regulatory network regulation of ACL in R. toruloides. The 
comparison of lipid content to ACL loss in glucose, xylose, 
and acetate media indicated very interesting carbon-source 
dependent differences in metabolic regulation and the exist-
ence of alternative routes to cytosolic acetyl-CoA. To our 
best knowledge, this is the first report characterizing ACL 
knockout in yeast in the xylose medium. While these results 
are more in agreement with what was reported earlier in Y. 
lipolytica on glucose, further studies are required to under -
stand why in R. toruloides the knockout responses on xylose 
and glucose were different. On a preliminary level, we spec-
ulated that upon knockout of ACL on xylose, the acetyl-CoA 
synthetase (ACS) could be used for the synthesis of cyto-
solic acetyl-CoA resulting in higher lipid content, while in 
glucose and acetate media the main role was staying with 
the ACL. It is known that ACS is transcriptionally regulated 
(Chen et al. 2012) and the only source of cytosolic acetyl-
CoA (Pronk et al. 1996) in S. cerevisiae. Large differences 
in signaling pathways under the consumption of xylose have 
already been reported, but mainly in S. cerevisiae. Assimila-
tion of xylose is weakly sensed by the intracellular branch of 
the cAMP/PKA pathway in yeast (Brink et al. 2021).
In this study, we showed that the lipid production was not 
changed as a result of the PK knockout (Figs.  2, 3, and 4). 
Unintuitively, our result also did not support the evidence 
from early biochemical studies on xylose as a carbon source. 
Compared to the alternative biosynthetic pathways for cyto-
solic acetyl-CoA production, the PK route bypasses the 
decarboxylation step of pyruvate into  CO2 and acetaldehyde 
(catalyzed by pyruvate decarboxylase) and the ATP expendi-
ture for the activation of acetate by ACS or citrate by ACL, 
thus potentially increasing the acetyl-CoA yield. We thought 
it was the reason why previously stoichiometric genome-
scale modeling predicted the PK route for the utilization of 
glucose or xylose in R. toruloides (Lopes et al. 2020; Reķēna 
et al. 2023) being in the agreement with previous enzyme 
abundance studies (Kim et al. 2021; Reķēna et al. 2023). But 
our results did not support this hypothesis on either of the 
substrates. Based on existing genetic engineering studies, we 
speculated that the metabolic flux can be rerouted through 
PK in a combination with silencing the expression of other 
enzymes in a close proximity. In Y. lipolytica, expression 
of PK worked to improve lipid production in phosphofruc-
tokinase (PFK) deletion background (Kamineni et al. 2021). 
Introduction of PK pathway was demonstrated in TKT and 
TAL deletion background to produce 3HP in S. cerevisiae  
(Hellgren et al. 2020). On the other hand, R. toruloides PK 
Km value would potentially explain why the PK is not critical

for lipid synthesis in the wild type strain. Alternatively, the 
bottleneck could be PTA or acetate kinase (ACK). Over -
expression of non-native PTA improved lipid titers in R. 
toruloides NP11 by 15.1% (Yang et al. 2018), but the role 
of ACK in R. toruloides still needs to be studied. In non-
oleaginous A. niger, which has a native PK pathway, het-
erologous PK pathway expression increased target product 
synthesis, while the deletion of ACK decreased it (Liu et al. 
2023). Also, it is worth noting that in the enzyme database 
BRENDA, the PTA reaction equation denotes acetyl-CoA 
as a substrate and acetyl-phosphate as a product. The ther -
modynamic feasibility of the pathway is unclear.
Finally, the results of this study suggested that cMAE 
plays no significant role in lipogenesis in R. toruloides  
IFO0880 and its presence has an adverse effect when grow-
ing on glucose. It was in good agreement with the early 
biochemical studies with R. glutinis (Yoon et al. 1984). 
Compared to the catabolic pathways of glucose or xylose, 
acetate assimilation requires less enzymatic conversions 
to synthesize the substrate of malic enzyme and, perhaps, 
the reason why stoichiometric genome-scale models have 
predicted the use of cMAE for NADPH regeneration upon 
assimilation of acetate (Lopes et al. 2020; Reķēna et al. 
2023). Our results confirmed that cytosolic malic enzyme 
is not critical for lipogenesis, suggesting that alterna-
tive routes for NADPH regeneration can be used, likely 
enzymes from the oxidative pentose phosphate pathway. 
Recent genetic engineering studies are available only 
on glucose. Lipogenesis induction upon a knockout was 
reported by Dulermo et al., when a mMAE in Y. lipolytica  
was deleted (Dulermo et al. 2015); although Y. lipolytica  
does not have a cMAE. Nevertheless, there is a slight dif-
ference that in wild type background, such an effect was 
not observed, but in an engineered strain for lipid produc-
tion (“Obese”), the adverse effect was observed. Perhaps 
we can say that according to our evidence, a wild type 
background is an even stronger argument for the cMAE 
non-essentiality in lipogenesis. But it is worth noting that 
overexpression of native cMAE in R. toruloides IFO0880 
(same strain) increased lipid titers by 28% (Zhang et al. 
2016a). Authors noted that this was a relatively minor 
increase compared to other enzymes that were introduced, 
but it shows that cMAE can play a role in lipogenesis of R. 
toruloides under certain conditions (e.g., overexpression).
In conclusion, we showed that ACL is essential for lipid 
synthesis and cell growth in R. toruloides. The cellular 
response to ACL loss was affected by the carbon source 
present in cultivation media. The results also demonstrated 
that cytosolic malic enzyme is not critically involved in lipid 
synthesis in R. toruloides and in some conditions is even 
disfavorable. The characterization of the PK knockout sug-
gested that it is not critical for the lipid synthesis. This work 
is useful for future metabolic engineering strategies of R. 
toruloides.
