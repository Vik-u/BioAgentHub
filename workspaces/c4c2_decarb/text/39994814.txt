Abstract 
Background Intestinal oxidative stress serves as an endogenous host defense against the gut microbiota by increas-
ing energy expenditure and therefore decreasing feed efficiency (FE). Several systems coordinately regulate redox bal-
ance, including the mitochondrial respiratory chain, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, 
and different antioxidants. However, it remains unclear which redox balance compartments in the intestine are crucial 
for determining FE.
Results In this study, we first screened the key targets of different metabolites and redox balance-related gene 
expression in broiler ceca. We then constructed a mouse colitis model to explore malic acid (MA) ability to allevi-
ate intestinal inflammation. We further used controlled release technology to coat MA and investigated its effects 
on the intestinal redox status and FE in vivo. Finally, we examined the underlying mechanism by which MA modulated 
redox status using a porcine intestinal epithelial cell jejunum 2 (IPEC-J2) cell model in vitro. Our results demonstrated 
that the MA/malic enzyme 3 (ME3) pathway may play an important role in reducing oxidative stress in the broiler 
cecum. In addition, colon infusion of MA attenuated inflammatory phenotypes in the dextran sulfate sodium salt 
(DSS) induced mouse colitis model. Then, dietary supplementation with controlled-release MA pellet (MAP) reduced 
the feed to gain (F/G) ratio and promoted chicken growth, with reduced oxidative stress and increased bacterial diver-
sity. Finally, the in vitro IPEC-J2 cell model revealed that ME3 mediated the effect of MA on cellular oxidative stress.
Conclusion In summary, our study firstly revealed the important role of the MA/ME3 system in the hindgut of broiler 
chickens for improving intestinal health and FE, which may also be crucial for the implications of colon inflammation 
associated diseases.

Introduction
In large-scale breeding, feed costs constitute approxi -
mately 60% of the total cost of livestock and poultry 
breeding [1]. Therefore, improving feed efficiency (FE) is 
crucial for increasing the efficiency of animal husbandry. 
Oxidative stress emerges as the primary factor reduc -
ing FE in broilers, manifesting in decreased feed intake, 
impaired growth performance, and immunosuppression. 
This stress is indicative of diminished activity within the

mitochondrial respiratory chain complex [2–4]. Reac -
tive oxygen species (ROS) disrupt redox homeostasis and 
cause severe damage to the host. There are effective pro -
tective systems against the potential deleterious effects 
of oxidative damage, including enzymatic and non-enzy -
matic antioxidants [5]. Enzymatic antioxidants include 
mainly glutathione redox and the thioredoxin/peroxire -
doxin system, and non-enzymatic antioxidants include 
vitamin C, vitamin E, and so on [6].
The gastrointestinal tract serves not only as the site 
for feed digestion and absorption, but also the primary 
source of ROS generation [7]. Researches have dem -
onstrated that hydrogen peroxide  (H2O2) is produced 
through various mechanisms, including nicotinamide 
adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, the 
mitochondrial electron transport chain, and D-amino 
acid oxidase etc., which are important for maintaining 
the intestinal microbiota balance and preventing micro -
biota disorders [8–10]. However, excess  H2O2 can also 
cause oxidative damage to the mucosa, leading to reduced 
growth performance and increased inflammation [11, 
12]. In our previous study, we found that oxidative stress 
was more pronounced in the hindgut compared to the 
foregut [13], which was consistent with the findings from 
other publications [14]. Therefore, delineating the ori -
gin of ROS and mitigating oxidative stress in the hind -
gut might be important strategies for enhancing animal 
growth performance and intestinal health.
In this study, we first screened the key targets of differ -
ent metabolites and redox balance-related gene expres -
sion in the cecum of broilers. The mouse model of colitis 
was subsequently used to explore the role of malic acid 
(MA) in alleviating intestinal inflammation. We further 
used controlled-release technology to coat MA pellets 
and investigated their effects on the intestinal redox sta -
tus and FE in vivo. Subsequently, the underlying mecha -
nism of MA regulation of redox status was investigated 
in  vitro by the porcine intestinal epithelial cell jejunum 
2 (IPEC-J2) cell model. This study establishes a vital role 
for developing new nutritional strategies to improve the 
chicken FE and offers insights into the treatment of colon 
inflammation-associated diseases.
Materials and methods
All procedures for animal care were approved by the 
South China Agricultural University Animal Care and 
Use Committee (Guangzhou, China;  Project number 
SYXK 20220136).
Animals, housing, experimental design and diets
To find key regulatory targets in chickens with different 
growth performance, in trial 1, 30 21-day-old Arbor Acre 
(AA) male × Ross female cross broilers (Qingnong Tech -
nology Co., Ltd., Guangdong, China, initial body weight 
377 ± 8.87 g) were housed at the Zengcheng Teaching 
and Research Base (South China Agricultural Univer -
sity, Guangdong, China) and allowed to drink (automatic 
device) and feed (daily manual addition) freely. The 
birds were not divided into groups and received only 
basal diets. Each bird was housed in a separate cage  
(25 cm × 30 cm × 30 cm) to avoid fecal disturbances, 
with controlled temperature/humidity controlled at  
(26 ± 1 °C/60% ± 10%) and 24 h light. The experiment lasted 
24 d (3 d pre-feeding period and a 21-d formal period). 
All birds were slaughtered without fasting. The entire 
cecum on the same side of each chicken was sampled, 
including cecal contents and mucosa, and stored at −80 °C 
until analysis. Body weight was measured at 24 and 45 d, 
and feed intake was recorded weekly. Body weight gain 
(BWG), cumulative feed intake (FI) and feed-to-gain ratio 
(F/G) were calculated. In order to better understand the 
correlation between production performance and various 
indicators, we divided 30 chickens into 2 groups based on 
the 3 indicators of F/G, BWG, and FI. In particular, the 
average F/G of the 30 chickens was calculated to be 2.3, 
and we designated 15 chickens with a value higher than 
2.3 as the high F/G group and 15 chickens with a value 
lower than 2.3 as the low F/G group. Similarly, the mean 
BWG of the 30 chickens was calculated to be 650 g. We 
designated the 15 chickens with values higher than 650 g 
as the high BWG group and the 15 chickens with values 
lower than 650 g as the low BWG group; the mean FI of 
the 30 chickens was calculated to be 1,700 g. We desig -
nated the 15 chickens with values higher than 1,700 g as 
the high FI group and the 15 chickens with values lower 
than 1,700 g as the low FI group.
We wondered if MA could alleviate hindgut inflam -
mation and offers insights into the treatment of colon 
inflammation-associated diseases. In trial 2, 32 male 
8-week-old C56BL/6 mice (acclimated for 1 week and 
initial body weight 19.03 ± 0.09 g, Zhuhai Baishitong 
Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Zhuhai, China,) were housed 
in a temperature/humidity-controlled facility (23 ± 3 
°C/70% ± 10%) under a 12 h light–dark cycle. Unless oth -
erwise stated, the mice were fed regular mouse chow 
(18.0% protein, 4.5% fat and 58% carbohydrate; Guang -
dong Medical Science Experiment Center, Guangdong, 
China) and water throughout the experiment. For colon 
perfusion, a 1-mL syringe barrel fitted with a flexible gav-
age needle (50 mm) was used. The mouse was grasped 
from the back with the abdomen facing upward and the 
head tilted downward at 45°. The abdomen of the mouse 
was gently rubbed so that the feces could be discharged, 
after which the tube was inserted through the anus, and 
after reaching the colon the liquid was instilled according 
Page 3 of 18
Jiang et al. Journal of Animal Science and Biotechnology           (2025) 16:28 
 
to the body weight, and then the tube was withdrawn. 
Keep this position for 30 s to allow all the fluid instilled 
into the intestinal tract. The 32 mice were divided into 4 
groups, with 8 replicates per group (in the same 2 cages). 
The trial lasted 21 d. Perfusions were administered every 
3 d  as follows: 1) Control group: Perfused with saline 
(0.9% sodium chloride solution, pH = 7) and given free 
access to water for 21 d. 2) MA group: Perfused with 
malic acid (MA) (10 μg/g, pH =  7; Sangon Biotech, 
Shanghai, China) and given free access to water for 21 d. 
3) DSS group: Perfused with saline for 21 d, with 3% dex -
tran sulfate sodium salt (DSS) added to drinking water 
for the last 6 d. 4) DSS + MA group: Perfused with MA 
for 21 d, with 3% DSS added to drinking water for the 
last 6 d. All the mice were culled at the end of the trial. 
Colons and livers from all mice were collected and colons 
stored at −80 °C until analysis.
In order to be applied in production practice and target 
the hindgut, we further used controlled-release technol -
ogy to coat MA pellets and investigated their effects on 
the intestinal redox status and FE in vivo. In trial 3, 120 
19-day-old Arbor Acre male × Ross female cross broilers 
(Qingnong Technology Co., Ltd., Guangdong, China, ini-
tial body weight 283.12 ± 2.46 g) were housed as the same 
with trial 1. Birds were randomly assigned to 4 groups, 
each group had 30 replicates with 1 bird per replicate. 
The groups were as follows: control group (Con), blank 
pellet group (containing 1‰ blank pellets, negative con -
trol, NC), MA group (containing 1‰ MA, pH = 7, MA), 
and the coated MA pellet group (containing 1‰ MA, 
MAP). Pellets detailed in the following paragraphs. 
Growth performance was recorded and calculated as in 
trial 1. This trial lasted 3 weeks. At the end of this experi -
ment, 15 chickens were randomly selected from each 
group for sampling. In trial 3, slaughter weight, liver 
weight, colon length, breast muscle weight, thigh muscle 
weight, and abdominal fat weight were recorded. Serum, 
cecal contents and mucosa (one side) were collected and 
stored at −80 °C until analysis.
The composition and nutrient levels of the basal diets 
are shown in the supplementary materials (Tables S1). 
Huayang Feedstuff Co., Ltd. (Foshan, China) provided the 
diet for broilers.
Cell culture and treatment
IPEC-J2 cells were donated by Academician Yin Yulong 
from the College of Animal Science, South China Agri -
cultural University. The cells were cultured in Dulbecco’s 
modified Eagle medium (DMEM) supplemented with 
10% fetal bovine serum, 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 μg/mL  
streptomycin in a 5%  CO2 incubator at 37 °C. When 
IPEC-J2 cells reached 50% confluency, we replaced fresh 
DMEM containing 0 mmol/L, 0.1 mmol/L, or 1 mmol/L 
MA (dissolved in PBS, pH = 7) and cultured them for 24 
h. Afterward, the cells were washed 3 times with pre-
cooled PBS, and the cell plates were stored at −80 °C for 
subsequent experiments.
Pellet preparation
The pellets were prepared by College of Pharmacy, 
Anhui University of Chinese Medicine using an extru -
sion and spheronization technique [15]. Briefly, 500 g 
of MA was dissolved in 700 mL water and adjusted to 
pH = 7 using NaOH. Microcrystalline cellulose (Henan 
Wanbang Chemical Technology Co., Ltd., 50% mass of 
the total pellets) was added as an excipient for shaping. 
Blank pellets contained only microcrystalline cellulose. 
The pellets were rounded in a granulator (LBLX-360, 
Jiujiang Dongsheng Machinery Manufacturing Co., Ltd., 
China). The prepared pellets were then dried at a con -
stant temperature of 55 °C for 12 h to ensure an opti -
mum and uniform humidity level. Based on the material 
the chicken feeds [16], we collected 30–40 mesh pellets, 
and each pellet weighed approximately 0.03 mg. Acrylic 
resin (Youcare Pharmaceutical Group, Anhui, China) was 
coated on the pellets using a fluidized bed coater (LDP-
1.5, Changzhou Jingtian Drying Granulation Equipment 
Co., Ltd., China).
Release test in vitro
Release test was conducted to determine the profiles of 
pellet release. Gastrointestinal fluid included simulated 
gastric fluid (SGF) (R30386, Shanghai yuanye Biotechnol-
ogy Co., Ltd., pH = 2, containing sodium chloride, dilute 
acid, pepsin, and so on), artificial small intestine fluid 
(SIF) (R30384, Shanghai yuanye Biotechnology Co., Ltd., 
pH = 6.8, including phosphates, pancreatic enzymes, and 
so on), and large intestine fluid (LIF) (pH = 7.5, adjusted 
pH with NaOH in SIF). The pellets and gastric fluid mix -
ture were mixed at 33% (w/v) ratio. Release test lasted 
for 12 h at different pH values. For pellet releases, we 
optimized using a shaker (THZ-98AB, Bluepard) with 
reference to dissolution apparatus (708-DS, Agilent). All 
pellets were sequentially added to SGF (2 h), SIF (4 h) and 
LIF (4 h) in turn. Samples were taken periodically, centri-
fuged at 10,000 × g for 5 min in an Eppendorf centrifuge 
(Eppendorf 5810R, Germany), and the supernatant was 
collected. Spectrophotometry (BIOTEK, Vermont, USA) 
was performed at a wavelength of 600 nm [17, 18].
HPLC for organic acid analysis
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC, 
Model 1260,  Agilent Technologies, Inc., USA) was used 
to analyze organic acid. The methods were performed as 
described previously [19]. Briefly, the contents/mucous 
Page 4 of 18Jiang et al. Journal of Animal Science and Biotechnology           (2025) 16:28 
were homogenized with methanol at a 1:9 ratio based 
on weight and centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 15 min at 4 
°C. The supernatant was collected and filtered through a 
0.22-μm syringe filter. Mixed standards (0, 7, 70, 135, 350, 
and 700 µg/mL) and a single standard (1 mg/mL) for each 
organic acid were used for chromatogram comparison. A 
Zorbax SB-Aq column (4.6 mm × 250 mm, 5 μm, Agilent) 
was used. The mobile phase for organic acids consisted 
of 25 mmol/L  KH2PO4 (pH = 2.5) to separate acetic acid, 
MA, lactic acid, citrate, oxaloacetic acid, α-ketoglutarate 
(AKG) and succinic acid. Chromatograms were collected 
at 254 nm. A flow rate of 1 mL/min was used for the iso -
cratic mode above. Aliquots of 20 µL were injected into 
the column, and determinations were performed at 25 °C.
Histological staining and analysis
The mouse colon was dissected without squeezing, cut 
into approximately 1 cm pieces, and fixed in a 2-mL cen -
trifuge tube containing 4% paraformaldehyde. The sam -
ples were then sent to Service Biotechnology Co. Ltd. 
(Wuhan, China) for paraformaldehyde fixation and par -
affin embedding. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining 
was used for histological staining. The severity of colitis 
was assessed based on pathological and histological fea -
ture, as previously described [20]. Briefly, the scoring 
system was as follows: 0: No or mild inflammation with 
depletion of goblet cells in histological tissue sections 
(observed under an H600L microscope, Nikon, Japan). 1: 
Acute focal inflammation and crypt abscess formation. 
2: Widespread inflammation with indications of thicken -
ing smooth muscle. 3: Ulcerations and cellular inflamma-
tion in tissue sections. 4: Signs of gangrene, necrosis, and 
mucosal tissue loss.
Colon length and disease activity index
In trial 2, colon length was measured using a ruler. Clini -
cal colitis severity was assessed by measuring body weight 
change, diarrhea, and bleeding as previously described 
[21]. Briefly, for diarrhea scores, 0 represented a firm and 
formed stool; 2 represented a soft and unformed stool; 
and 4 represented a liquid stool. We modified the bleed -
ing scores: 0 represented normal stool; 2 represented 
bloody stool; and 4 represented bloody stool throughout 
the entire anus. Weight loss was scored as follows [22]: 
0 for no significant weight loss, 1 for 1%–5% loss, 2 for 
5%–10% loss, 3 for 10%–20% loss, and 4 for greater than 
20% loss. The disease activity index (DAI) was the sum 
of weight loss score, diarrhea score, and bleeding score 
divided by 3.
Immunofluorescence staining
Dihydroethidium (DHE) (D1008, UElandy) was used at 
a 1:1,000 dilution to stain frozen cecum sections  (8 μm 
thick) [23]. TUNEL (C1086, Beyotime), Ki67(27309-
1-AP , Proteintech), F4/80 (29414-AP , Proteintech), 
MUC2 (A14659, ABclonal), and LYZ (A0641, ABclonal) 
staining were performed on 5 μm paraffin slices. All the 
paraffin sections were dewaxed in water and underwent 
antigen retrieval using sodium citrate. Staining proce -
dures were carried out according to the manufacturers’ 
instructions.
Apoptotic cells were detected using a TUNEL Apopto -
sis Kit [24]. Paraffin sections were treated with proteinase 
K and labeled with terminal deoxynucleotide transferase 
(TdT)  enzyme added along with a nucleotide mix con -
taining fluorescein-dUTP conjugate, then washed with 
PBS. Proliferating cells were stained with Ki67, and mac -
rophages with F4/80. Sections were blocked with 0.1% 
Tween in phosphate-buffered saline (PBST) containing 
5% goat serum. Primary antibodies were diluted 1:1,000 
in 5% goat serum PBST and incubated at 4 °C overnight. 
Secondary antibodies (goat anti-rabbit IgG H + L Cy3: 
JAC 111-165-045, 1:1,000, Jackson) were added to PBST 
and then incubated at room temperature for 1 h. Paneth 
cells were stained with LYZ and goblet cells with MUC2. 
Sections were blocked with Tris-buffered saline (TBS) 
containing 5% goat serum, washed with 0.1% Tween in 
TBS (TBST) and TBS, then incubated with primary anti -
bodies (1:1,000 in TBS) at 4 °C overnight. Secondary anti-
bodies (goat anti-rabbit IgG H + L Cy3: JAC 111-165-045, 
1:1,000, Jackson) incubation was performed as described 
above, using TBS as the diluent. DAPI was used to stain 
nucleus. Finally, a fluorescence microscope (Nikon 
Instruments, Tokyo, Japan) was used for observation and 
imaging.
To assess cell proliferation, we used the Cell-Light EdU 
Apollo488 In  Vitro Kit (C10310, RiboBio, Guangzhou, 
China). Cells were labeled with EdU and incubated for 
12 h, then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. Apollo stain -
ing and Hoechst 33342 nuclear staining followed. An 
Annexin V-FITC/PI Apoptosis Assay Kit (40302ES50, 
Yeasen, Shanghai, China) was used for cell apoptosis 
evaluation. Annexin-V identifies early apoptotic cells, 
while PI marks late apoptotic and necrotic cells. We 
washed the cells with cooled PBS, then added binding 
buffer, Annexin V-FITC, and PI staining solution, after 
a 10-min incubation at room temperature in darkness. 
Hoechst 33342 was used to stain the cell nuclei.
RNA interference
RNA interference was performed as previously described 
[25]. Malic enzyme 3 (ME3) siRNA and negative control

Jiang et al. Journal of Animal Science and Biotechnology           (2025) 16:28 
 
(NC) siRNA were purchased from RiboBio (Guang -
zhou, China) and transfected into IPEC-J2 cells using 
Lipofectamine reagents (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, 
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The 
sequences of the siRNA targeting ME3 were siME3-1 
((5′-CUC AAC AAA UAC CGC AAC ATT-3′ (sense) and 
5′ - TGT  TGC GGT ATT TGT TGA GTT-3′ (antisense)), 
siME3-2 ((5′-CCA  AGA UUA CGA CGA CCU UTT-3′ 
(sense) and 5′ - AAG  GTC GTC GTA ATC TTG GTT-3′ 
(antisense)), and siME3-3((5′-GUG ACC  UGG ACA AGU 
ACA UTT-3′ (sense) and 5′ - ATG TAC  TTG TCC AGG 
TCA CTT-3′ (antisense)). IPEC-J2 cells were transfected 
with either the NC siRNA or ME3 siRNA for 6 h. An 
aliquot of the transfected cells was collected to measure 
ME3 gene expression, while another aliquot was treated 
with 0 mmol/L, 0.1 mmol/L, or 1 mmol/L MA for subse -
quent experiments.
Real‑time PCR
The absolute PCR experiment was conducted accord -
ing to previously described methods [26]. DNA was 
extracted from the cecal contents using a commercial kit 
(D3141-03, Magen, Guangzhou, China). Briefly, 100 mg 
of contents was added to glass beads along with buffer 
ATL/PVP-10 and buffer PCI, then vortexed for 10 min 
to disrupt the samples. After heating and centrifugation, 
supernatant was incubated with RNase A, proteinase K, 
and AL buffer, then heated again. Anhydrous ethanol 
was added, and the mixture was passed through a HiPure 
DNA Mini Column II and centrifuged. The DNA was 
washed with Buffer GW1 and Buffer GW2, and finally 
the DNA was dissolved in nucleic acid-free water and 
stored at −80 °C.
To establish a standard curve, DNA was amplified via 
polymerase chain reaction (PCR, Biosystems QuantStu -
dio 3, Takara, Japan). The reaction protocol consisted of 
an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 60 s, followed by 40 
cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 15 s, annealing at 60 
°C for 60 s, and extension at 72 °C for 30 s. A final cycle 
of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 60 s, and 95 °C for 30 s was 
performed to obtain a melting curve. The PCR products 
were then recovered using a HiPure Gel Pure DNA Mini 
Kit (D2111-02, Magen). After separating the products in 
1% agarose gel, the gel was excised and placed in a cen -
trifuge tube. GDP buffer was added, and the mixture was 
heated at 55 °C for 15 min. The resulting mixture was 
transferred to a HiPure DNA Mini Column, centrifuged 
at 12,000 × g for 60 s, and cleaned with DW2 buffer. The 
purified DNA was dissolved in nuclease-free water and 
stored at −80 °C. To generate the standard curve, serial 
dilutions of DNA (10-, 100-, 1,000-, 10,000-, 100,000-, 
1,000,000-, 10,000,000-fold dilutions) were prepared. 
The PCR reaction mixture (20 μL) contained 0.5 μL each 
of forward and reverse primers (10 μmol/L), 10 μL TB 
Green® Premix Ex Taq ™ II (Tli RNaseH Plus) (Takara, 
Japan), 2 μL template DNA, and 7 μL  ddH2O. Bacterial 
copy numbers were calculated using the corresponding 
standard curve, as described previously [27]. Briefly, the 
gene copy numbers were determined using the follow -
ing equation: (DNA concentration (μg/μL) × 6.0233 ×  1023 
copies/mol)/(DNA size (bp) × 660 ×  106).
A real-time PCR assay was conducted as described 
previously [28]. Total RNA from cecal mucosa was 
extracted using the HiPure RNA Kit (R4130, Magen). 
Samples were treated with MagZol reagent and chloro -
form to obtain a nucleic acid supernatant. Ethanol was 
added to create suitable binding conditions, after which 
the mixture was transferred to the purification column 
and centrifuged. The RNA, bound to the membrane, was 
washed and then eluted with RNase-free water. One μg 
total RNA was reverse-transcribed into complemen -
tary DNA (cDNA, A0010CGQ, EZB). Briefly, the reac -
tion system was: 1 μg total RNA, 5 μL 4 × RT Master 
mix, and nuclease-free  ddH2O2 to a final volume of 20 
μL. The reaction protocol was 42 °C for 15 min, followed 
by 95 °C for 30 s. SYBR Green relative quantitative real-
time PCR was performed according to published pro -
tocols [29]. The reaction mixture (20 μL) contained 0.5 
μL each of forward and reverse primers (10 μmol/L), 10 
μL 2 × SYBR Green Master Mix (ROX2 Plus) (A0001-R2, 
EZB), 2 μL template DNA, and 7 μL  ddH2O. The reac -
tion protocol consisted of initial denaturation at 95 °C 
for 60 s, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95°C 
for 15 s and annealing/extension at 60 °C for 60 s. A final 
cycle of 95 °C for 15 s, 60 °C for 60 s, and 95 °C for 30 s 
was performed to generate a melting curve. Results were 
calculated using the  2−ΔΔCT method [26] and normalized 
to the expression of the housekeeping gene: β-actin for  
Gallus using, and GAPDH for Sus. The primer sequences 
are shown in Table 1.
Biochemical analysis
Serum, cecal contents, and mucosa were collected. 
Serum was used for testing without special handling. 
The following enzyme activities and contents were 
detected using commercial kits: superoxide dismutase 
(SOD) (BC0170, Solarbio), oxidized thioredoxin reduc -
tase (TRX) (BC1155, Solarbio), glutamate dehydroge -
nase (GDH) (BC1460, Solarbio), glutathione peroxidase 
(GPx) (S0057S, Beyotime), ROS (BB470515, Bestbio),

indicated, all assays were corrected using either Bicin -
choninic Acid Assay (BCA) (23227, Thermo) or sample 
weight. All procedures were performed according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions.
16S rRNA
Cecal contents were used for 16S rRNA. Library construc-
tion was carried out following the protocol of the ALFA-
SEQ DNA Library Prep Kit (NDI001E-01, Findrop), and 
the size of the library fragments was evaluated on the 
Qsep400 High-Throughput Nucleic Acid & Protein Anal-
ysis System (Hangzhou Houze Biotechnology Co., Ltd., 
China). The concentration of the library was measured 
using a Qubit 4.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, 
USA). The primer sequences were 338F: 5′-ACT CCT ACG 
GGA GGC AGC A-3′ and 806R: 5′ -GGA CTA CHVGGG 
TWT CTAAT-3′, targeting V3–V4 region. The constructed 
amplicon libraries were subjected to PE250 sequencing on 
either the Illumina or MGI platform (Guangdong Magi -
gene Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Guangzhou, China).
A similarity of 97% was clustered into operational taxo-
nomic units (OTUs). In addition, we excluded the influ -
ence of low-abundance species and retained OTUs with 
relative abundance > 0.01%. For bioinformatics analy -
sis, the bacterial diversity index (Simpson and Shan -
non), richness (ACE and Chao1), bacterial community 
structure of principal coordinates (PCoAs), and linear 
discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) analysis were 
performed. LEfSe analysis was used to calculate signifi -
cance based on linear discriminant analysis (LDA) effect 
size ≥ 4.5 and P < 0.05. In addition, we also analyzed the 
proportions of Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes of each 
group at the phylum level, and Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes 
at the phylum level was made.
Statistics and data analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism 
8.0 software (Chicago, IL, USA). Differences between 
the two groups were assessed using the t -test. One-way 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for compari -
sons between multiple groups. Duncan’s multiple range 
test was used to compare the differences among groups. 
T-test and Wilcox Rank-Sum test were used for α diversity 
analysis. R (version 3.2.0) software was used for β diver -
sity analysis. All fluorescent images were calculated using 
the Image J. The data were presented as the mean ± SEM. 
P ≤ 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.
Results
Cecal redox and energy metabolites in the growth 
performance of broilers
To explore the differences in redox and energy metabo -
lites in the cecum tract, in trial 1, we analyzed mRNA 
expression in the cecal mucosa and metabolites in 
both cecal mucosa and contents. We compared values 
between two groups with different feed efficiency. The 
results demonstrated that the cecal mucosal GSH, ME3 
mRNA (approximately 1.5-fold) expression, and MA in 
content (approximately 3-fold) with a low F/G ratio were 
higher than those with a high F/G ratio. (Fig.  1A–C). 
GSH/GSSG (approximately 1.7-fold) and IDH1 mRNA 
(approximately 1.5-fold) were increased in high BWG 
(Fig. 1D–F). Moreover, H6PD and IDH1 mRNA (approxi-
mately 1.5-fold) were higher in high FI (Fig.  1G–I). 
Finally, our analysis focused on indicators of F/G. The 
redox capacity with low F/G was enhanced in broilers.
Colonic perfusion of MA alleviates colitis in mice
To investigate the effects of MA on intestinal oxidative 
stress and ulcerative colitis, we employed a dextran sul -
fate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis mouse model with 
colon perfusion of MA. The results showed that MA 
administration mitigated several symptoms in DSS-
induced colitis mice, including body weight loss, weight 
loss score, diarrhea score, and DAI in DSS-induced colitis 
mice, but had no significant impact on fecal occult blood 
(Fig.  2B–F). MA administration counteracted the detri -
mental effects of DSS on the liver index, colon length and 
weight (Fig.  2G–I), as well as the inflammatory cell infil -
tration in the colon (Fig. 2J and K).
Colonic perfusion MA reduces oxidative stress and 
inflammation and increases the intestinal barrier in mice
To assess oxidative stress and the intestinal barrier function, 
we performed ROS, F4/80, MUC2, and LYZ staining on the 
colon. MA administration significantly reduced DSS-induced 
oxidative stress and macrophages infiltration (Fig. 3A–D), 
while enhancing the intestinal barrier of the colon (Fig. 3E–
H). In addition, colitis typically leads to abnormal prolif -
eration and apoptosis of intestinal cells. Here, we found that 
colonic infusion of MA reduced cell proliferation, but did not 
affect on apoptosis caused by colitis (Fig. 3I and L).
Effects of dietary supplementation with MA and MAP 
on the growth performance of broilers
To achieve spatial-specific release in the hindgut of broil-
ers, we developed a coated pellet for controlled release. 
The release curve showed that the pellet release rate was 
less than 10% in both simulated gastric fluid (SGF) and 
artificial small intestine fluid (SIF), but achieved com -
plete release in large intestine fluid (LIF) (Fig.  4A and 
B). We then supplemented diets with MA and MAP to 
investigate broiler growth performance. We observed 
that the MA and MAP increased average daily feed 
intake by approximately 5 g/d compared to the Con. 
Moreover, MA and MAP increased average daily body 
Page 8 of 18Jiang et al. Journal of Animal Science and Biotechnology           (2025) 16:28 
gain more than Con, with MAP outperforming MA by 2 
g/d. In addition, MA and MAP reduced F/G compared 
to the Con, with MA showing a lower F/G than Con, and 
MAP demonstrating an even lower F/G than MA by 0.1. 
Thus, MAP exhibited a better effect than MA on broiler 
growth performance (Fig. 4C–F).
Effects of dietary MAP supplementation on the slaughter 
performance and colon length in broilers
We further investigated the effects of MAP on broiler 
slaughter performance and organ indices. While no dif -
ferences were observed in liver weight, MAP significantly 
increased the slaughter weight, eviscerated carcass weight, 
abdominal fat weight, breast and thigh muscle weight, and 
colon length (Table 2). MAP and MA groups had slaugh -
ter weight over 100 g heavier than Con, with MAP out -
weighing MA by more than 40 g. For eviscerated carcass 
weight, both MAP and MA groups were over 100 g heavier 
than Con, with MAP exceeding MA by more than 20 g. 
Abdominal fat weight in MAP and MA groups was more 
than 2 g heavier than the Con, with MAP surpassing MA 
by an additional 2 g. Breast muscle weight in MAP and MA 
groups was more than 14 g heavier than Con. The thigh 
muscle weight in the MAP group was 18 g higher than Con 
and 5 g higher than the MA group. Additionally, the colon 
length in the MAP group was 0.9 cm longer than Con.

Dietary supplementation of MAP improved the cecal redox 
capacity and the TCA cycle of broilers
We further investigated the effect of MAP on the redox 
status of the cecum in broilers. The results showed that 
MAP significantly increased the  H2O2 in cecal content 
(Fig. 5A). Moreover, MAP lowered serum MDA level but 
had no effect on the serum ROS level or total antioxi -
dant capacity (T-AOC) (Fig.  5B–D). While MAP had no 
impact on mucosal MDA,  H2O2, NADPH, or intestinal 
ROS contents (Fig.  5E–I), it markedly elevated the GSH/
GSSG ratio and GPx1 mRNA expression were mark -
edly elevated (Fig.  5J and K). In the cecal mucosa, MAP 
decreased AKG and succinic acid level while raising MA 
and lactate level (Fig. 5L–O).
Dietary MAP supplementation changes the intestinal 
microbiota of broilers
To determine the effects of MAP on intestinal micro -
biota, the metabolites in cecum contents was measured. 
We found that MAP had no significance on lactic acid

level, but reduced total LPS in the contents (Fig.  6A and 
B). Moreover, the total number of bacteria was not dif -
ferent between the groups (Fig.  6C). 16S rRNA sequenc -
ing analysis revealed that in MAP group Shannon index 
decreased and Simpson index increased, while Chao1 
index and ACE index had no significance (Fig.  6D–G). 
Thus, the α diversity of the content microbiota showed 
a slightly significant difference between the two groups. 
Moreover, β diversity of PCoA revealed that the bacterial 
composition of MAP was distinct from NC (Fig.  6I). At 
the phylum level, NC had a higher relative abundance of 
Firmicutes and a lower relative abundance of Bacteroi -
detes compared to MAP . Consequently, the Firmicutes/
Bacteroidetes ratio was decreased in MAP (Fig.  6H  and 
J). Meanwhile, we noticed that Bacteroides and Bacte -
roidaceae had an important role in MPA, while Lach -
nospiraceae had a pivotal role in NC (Fig.  6K). LDA 
score also confirmed this point. Moreover, Clostridiales, 
Clostridia, Firmicutes and Lachnospiraceae in NC signif -
icantly different compared with MAP (Fig.  6L). Correla-
tion analysis showed that Bacteroides in MAP group had 
positive correlation with DFI (Fig. 6M).

ME3 is essential for MA to enhance the redox capacity 
of intestinal epithelial cells
To explore the role of MA in redox capacity, we treated 
IPEC-J2 cells with various concentrations of MA. Ini -
tially, we first found that MA had no effect on intracel -
lular  H2O2 or MDA levels. (Fig.  7A and B). However, 
MA significantly reduced intracellular ROS level and 
 NADP+/NADPH ratio, while increasing the GSH/GSSG 
ratio (Fig.  7C–E). Similarly, MA had no effect on GPx 
enzyme activity, GPx4  or DUOX2 mRNA expression, 
but significantly increased NOX4  mRNA expression 
(Fig.  7F and G). Based on our observation of higher 
ME3 mRNA levels in low F/G groups in trial 1, we 
investigated the function of ME3 in redox capacity. We 
interfered with ME3 and co-treated cells with MA. The 
result demonstrated that co-treatment decreased the 
intracellular GSH/GSSG ratio after two different siME3 
knockout (Fig. 7 H–J).

Discussion
Numerous studies have shown that oxidative stress nega-
tively affects feed efficiency [30– 32]. It is the main cause 
of reduced FE in broilers, disrupting the redox system 
and energy metabolism. Birds adapt to oxidative stress by 
increasing the levels of endogenous antioxidants [33]. In 
trial 1, we screened the main metabolite indicators, includ-
ing energy metabolism and redox, in the cecum of broilers. 
We found that broilers with lower F/G had higher GSH, 
GSH/GSSG, and MA contents in the cecal chyme. ME3 
and H6PD mRNA expression were higher in the low F/G 
and high FI groups. IDH1 mRNA expression was higher 
in the high BWG and high FI groups. These findings indi-
cated that enhanced redox capacity in low F/G broilers.
In the redox balance system, both ME3, H6PD, and 
IDH1 are required for NADPH production [34, 35].

NADPH serves two major functions: generating superox-
ide  (O2−) by NADPH oxidases (NOXs) and the scaveng -
ing of  H2O2 by regenerating GSH and the TRX [36]. MA, 
a C4 dicarboxylic acid, is primarily produced through 
microbial fermentation and enzymatic synthesis [37]. It 
has been reported that MA has pivotal role of maintain -
ing high level of GSH, thereby reducing oxidative stress 
and inflammation [38, 39]. Interestingly, we also noticed 
that SOD and GPx had no significance between high 
and low growth performance. The redox system exhibits 
tissue specificity and age-related differences, respond -
ing variably to diverse stress challenges. For example, 
SOD and GPx are crucial in the livers of aged rats and 
the hypothalamus of stressed rats, but not in the heart 
[40, 41]. Under heat stress, 21 d broilers demonstrated 
greater antioxidant capacity than 45 d broilers [42]. These 
evidences suggest that the MA/ME3 pathway, but not 
SOD or GPx, might be specifically important for hind -
gut redox homeostasis. However, MA originates from the 
citrate pyruvate cycle and oxaloacetate, and is influenced

by various enzymes. An increase in MA elevates ME3 
expression, while elevated ME3 expression leads to a 
decrease in MA. Consequently, changes in MA and ME3 
levels may not occur synchronously.
Oxidative stress is considered a major cause of intesti -
nal inflammation. Its destructive effects may contribute 
to the initiation and/or propagation of the inflammatory 
bowel diseases [43]. Interestingly, several studies have 
reported increased levels of MA during colitis treat -
ment [44, 45]. To reveal the effect of MA on intestinal 
inflammation, a DSS-induced colitis mouse model was 
adopted with colon-perfused of MA. We found that MA 
significantly reduced weight loss, diarrhea score, and 
DAI. However, after DSS induction, the liver index, colon 
length, and weight were significantly increased. We also 
noticed that the colon length was longer in the MAP 
group. Additionally, MA significantly reduced the colonic 
histopathological score. Colitis typically presents with 
goblet cell reduction, a thinner mucus layer, immune cell 
infiltration, abnormal and persistent crypt cell hyperpro -
liferation, and increased apoptosis [46–48]. We found 
that MA significantly decreased the colonic ROS, mac -
rophage infiltration, Panzer cell number, and abnormal 
colonic proliferation, while increasing goblet cell number. 
Recent research has showed that organoids produce MA 
during transplantation, which becomes enriched in cecal 
contents. MA regulates macrophage polarization and 
promotes intestinal recovery from ischemia–reperfusion 
(I/R) injury through a suppressor of cytokine signaling 
2-dependent mechanism, positively impacting intestinal 
injury repair [38]. In addition, we observed that blood in 
the stool did not improve at the later stages. We hypoth -
esized that as the duration of DSS induction increased, 
bleeding also occurred in the foregut, an area that MA 
did not reach. Therefore, these results indicate that MA 
could reduce colonic oxidative stress and inflammation, 
increase the intestinal barrier in mice, and consequently 
relieve colitis.
Intestinal inflammation leads to decreased feed intake, 
compromised intestinal health, and ultimately dimin -
ished growth performance in livestock [49]. Our pre -
vious research indicated that oxidative stress is more 
pronounced in the hindgut compared to the foregut [13]. 
Therefore, we used a controlled-release technique to 
deliver MA, which relieves intestinal inflammation in the 
hindgut. Here, we found that the MAP group exhibited 
a better daily feed intake, daily body weight gain and a 
lower F/G ratio than the MA group. It has been reported 
that the supplementation of 0.4% or 0.8% of MA to the 
diets of AA broilers at 2,242 d increased the BWG and 
decreased the F/G ratio [50]. However, supplementation 
of 0, 0.5%, 1% and 2% MA to the basal diet were found 
to had no effect on growth performance of fattening pig 
or Landrace × Yorkshire sows [51, 52]. By using an encap-
sulation technique, our lower dose of MA (1‰) achieved 
effects comparable to 0.4% MA supplementation. In addi-
tion, the MAP group demonstrated smaller within-group 
error and coefficient of variation compared to the other 
three groups. These findings suggest that individual dif -
ferences in chicken farming may significantly contribute 
to hindgut oxidative stress. The encapsulation technique 
has gained widespread use in recent years [53], indicating 
its great potential in livestock and poultry breeding.
MA plays an important role in energy metabolism, 
redox balance and lipid metabolism. It serves as both 
an intermediate in the TCA cycle, catalyzed by malate 
dehydrogenase to produce oxaloacetate, and a substrate 
for MEs. MEs generate NADPH, which is vital for the 
scavenging free radicals in the redox system or pro -
ducing ROS via NADPH oxidases [54, 55]. Here, MAP 
reduced serum MDA concentration and increased the 
mucosal GSH/GSSG ratio. Similarly, MA increased the 
GSH/GSSG ratio and decreased the  NADP+/NADPH 
ratio in vitro. GSH/GSSG is the major redox pair in cells, 
with glutathione reductase catalyzing GSSG reduction to 
GSH using NADPH as an electron donor to regenerate 
GSH [56, 57]. These findings are consistent with previ -
ous reports that MA reduces the MDA level in rat liver 
and heart, increases the GSH content, and accelerates 
the elimination of the damage caused by ROS [40]. MA 
has multiple metabolic pathways in the cell. For exam -
ple, in the mitochondrial matrix, malic acid can be cata -
lyzed by malate dehydrogenase to produce oxaloacetate 
and NADH. It can also be metabolized by ME1 or ME3 
to generate pyruvate and NADPH. Pyruvate can then 
be further converted to lactate or enter the TCA cycle 
[36]. Here, we speculate that the oxygen content in the 
hindgut is too low for MA to enter the TCA cycle and 
undergo oxidative phosphorylation. Thus, MA likely gen-
erates pyruvate, which is eventually converted to lactate. 
Notably, MAP increased  H2O2 in the cecum content, 
whereas MA treatment failed to alter  H2O2 levels in the 
cell medium. We speculate the divergence might be due 
to the intestinal microbiota. Moreover, NADPH oxidases 
(NOXs) are also a pathway for ROS production [8]. We 
also found that in IPEC-J2 cells, MA treatment of cells 
resulted in elevated mRNA expression of NOX4.
In trial 3, we discovered that MAP decreased the 
amount of LPS, so we made 16S rRNA. We found that 
MAP reduced bacterial α diversity, and the contribution 
of gut microbiota to the beneficial effects of MA was Bac-
teroides. Bacteroides are anaerobic and Gram-negative 
rods, which consume polysaccharides in the hindgut 
and produce short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) [58]. Previ -
ous research has revealed that fecal bacterial genera, 
such as Bacteroides, were more abundant in high feed

conversion ratio chickens [59]. This is consistent with 
our findings. Therefore, we hypothesized that differences 
in the amount of SCFA in the cecum may contribute to 
FE variability. Moreover, previous studies in germ-free 
mice have shown that during hindgut development, Bac -
teroides thetaiotaomicron stimulates angiogenesis, which 
is associated with the formation of a capillary network 
that efficiently distributes absorbed nutrients [60]. The 
normal gut microbiota has also been shown to impart a 
healthy metabolome in the serum by increasing the con -
centrations of pyruvic acid, citric acid, fumaric acid and 
malic acid, all of which are indicators of higher energy 
metabolism [61]. However, the precise mechanisms by 
which MA regulates the interaction between bacteria and 
intestinal epithelial cells require further investigation.
Malic enzymes (MEs) play crucial roles in cellular 
energy production, redox homeostasis, and cancer devel -
opment by converting MA to pyruvate and NADPH. 
Three ME isoforms have been identified: cytoplasmic 
NADP-dependent malic enzyme 1 (ME1), mitochon -
drial NAD(P)-dependent malic enzyme 2 (ME2) and 
mitochondrial NADP-dependent malic enzyme 3 (ME3) 
[35]. It has been well studied that knockdown of ME1 
and ME2 can cause oxidative stress. Moreover, there is 
a compensatory relationship among MEs [62–64]. How -
ever, the role of ME3 had rarely been investigated. In this 
study, we found the positive relationship between ME3 
and a low F/G ratio, but not ME1. To reduce the off-tar -
get effect, we used two independent siRNA sequences for 
interference. It was found that both of them could effec -
tively block the effect of MA on GSH/GSSG, suggesting 
that ME3 is essential for MA.
Conclusion
The MA/ME3 pathway-mediated redox capacity was 
closely related to the F/G ratio of broilers; targeted deliv -
ery of MA to the hindgut or colonic perfusion improved 
intestinal redox capacity, reduced inflammation, and 
enhanced feed efficiency.
