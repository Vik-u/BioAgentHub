Abstract
We crossed the C 3 species Atriplex prostrata with the C 4 species Atriplex rosea to produce F 1 and F 2 hybrids. All 
hybrids exhibited C 3-like δ13C values, and had reduced rates of net CO 2 assimilation compared with A. prostrata. 
The activities of the major C 4 cycle enzymes PEP carboxylase, NAD-malic enzyme, and pyruvate-P i dikinase in the 
hybrids were at most 36% of the C 4 values. These results demonstrate the C 4 metabolic cycle was disrupted in the 
hybrids. Photosynthetic CO 2 compensation points (Г) of the hybrids were generally midway between the C 3 and C 4 
values, and in most hybrids were accompanied by low, C3-like activities in one or more of the major C4 cycle enzymes. 
This supports the possibility that most hybrids use a photorespiratory glycine shuttle to concentrate CO 2 into the 
bundle sheath cells. One hybrid exhibited a C4-like Г of 4 µmol mol–1, indicating engagement of a C4 metabolic cycle. 
Consistently, this hybrid had elevated activities of all measured C 4 cycle enzymes relative to the C3 parent; however, 
C3-like carbon isotope ratios indicate the low Г is mainly due to a photorespiratory glycine shuttle. The anatomy of 
the hybrids resembled that of C 3-C4 intermediate species using a glycine shuttle to concentrate CO 2 in the bundle 
sheath, and is further evidence that this physiology is the predominant, default condition of the F 2 hybrids. Progeny 
of these hybrids should further segregate C 3 and C4 traits and in doing so assist in the discovery of C 4 genes using 
high-throughput methods of the genomics era.
Key words: C 4 engineering, C4 photosynthesis, CO2 concentrating mechanism, photosynthetic hybrids, Rubisco.
Introduction
C4 photosynthesis is a carbon-concentrating mechanism that 
evolved from C 3 progenitors at least 65 times (Sage et  al., 
2012). During C 4 evolution, a coordinated series of ana-
tomical and biochemical adjustments established the com-
partmentation and enzyme activities required to efficiently 
concentrate CO
2 around Rubisco (Monson and Rawsthorne, 
2000). In the process, dozens to hundreds of genes have 
been altered (Bräutigam et al., 2011a, b; Gowik et al., 2011). 
A number of the modifications to key biochemical enzymes 
such as PEP carboxylase have been identified, although most 
remain unknown, particularly the genes controlling the ana-
tomical modifications (Kajala et  al., 2011; Ludwig, 2013). 
Identification of these elements is essential in the effort to 
improve C
4 photosynthesis and potentially engineer the C 4 
pathway into C3 crops, as is now being attempted with rice 
(von Caemmerer et al., 2012; http://c4rice.irri.org/).
Gene discovery is most efficient when researchers can apply 
forward and reverse genetic approaches using genetic model 
organisms (Meinke et al., 1998). Unfortunately, in the case of 
the C
4 pathway, ideal model organisms have not been devel-
oped, although Setaria viridis is a potential candidate (Li and 
Brutnell, 2011; Covshoff et al., 2014). The lack of tractable 
genetic models for C
4 photosynthesis requires that alternative 
means of gene discovery be considered. One option is to gen-
erate hybrids between closely related C
3 and C 4 species, and 
then use a genetic mapping strategy to associate genes with 
segregating traits. A  number of congeneric pairs of C
3 and 
C4 species have been hybridized since the discovery of the C4

pathway. The first C3 × C4 hybrids were produced by Malcolm 
Nobs and Olle Björkman (Fig. 1) between Atriplex rosea (C4) 
and Atriplex prostrata (C 3, formerly termed A.  patula ssp. 
hastata and A. triangularis; Kadereit et al., 2010), and A. rosea 
and A. glabriuscula (C3) (Björkman et al., 1969; Osmond et al., 
1980). Subsequent efforts created hybrids between C3 and C4-
like Flaveria species (Apel et al., 1988), and C3-C4 intermedi-
ate and C 4 Flaveria species (Brown et  al., 1986; Brown and 
Bouton, 1993). Hybrids have also been generated between 
C3 and C 3-C4 intermediate Panicum species (Bouton et  al., 
1986). In many of the Flaveria crosses, the F 1 hybrids were 
sterile (Brown and Bouton, 1993). In cases where F 2 hybrids 
were generated and segregation of traits observed, problems 
associated with chromosome abnormalities and pairing were 
evident, such that mapping populations could not be formed 
(Osmond et al., 1980; Covshoff et al., 2014). All hybrid studies 
were abandoned, and the hybrids eventually perished.
With the advent of high-throughput sequencing and bioin-
formatics, the ability to evaluate genetic differences between 
hybrid offspring has dramatically improved, such that the 
requirement for a mapping population can be relaxed. Of par-
ticular promise is sequencing of transcriptomes (RNA-Seq), 
which can quantify gene expression over a large dynamic 
range and does not require prior knowledge of the genome 
sequence (Bräutigam and Gowik, 2010). Comparative tran-
scriptomics has already been used to identify genes that are 
differentially expressed in leaves of closely related C
3 and C4 
plants (Bräutigam et  al., 2011a, b; Gowik et  al., 2011). By 
using a comparative transcriptomics approach with segregat-
ing F
2 hybrids, the C4 genes controlling the segregating traits 
may be identified.
C3 × C4 hybrids can also provide novel insights for under-
standing C4 structure, function, and evolution. With advances 
in photosynthetic methodology, the development of theoreti-
cal models of C
3 and C 4 photosynthesis, and an improved 
appreciation of how structural adaptations enhance C4 func-
tion, we are now in a much better position to interpret pat-
terns observed in C
3 × C 4 hybrid lines then was the case a 
generation ago (Dengler and Nelson, 1999; von Caemmerer, 
2000; Sage et al., 2013). Predictions from theoretical models 
of C4 photosynthesis developed since the hybrid era can also 
provide valuable insights that will aid the interpretation of 
C
3 × C4 hybrid studies (von Caemmerer, 2000; Ubierna et al., 
2013). In addition, models describing the function of C 3-C4 
intermediate species (Rawsthorne et al., 1988; von Caemmerer, 
1989 and 1992) appeared near the end of the hybrid studies 
(Brown and Bouton, 1993). With the modern understand-
ing of C
3-C4 intermediacy, it is now possible to address the 
degree to which C 3 × C 4 hybrids express the physiology of 
C3, C4, or C 3-C4 intermediate species (Sage et al., 2012). In 
C3-C4 intermediates, the major physiological trait is a CO 2-
concentrating mechanism (CCM) that shuttles photorespira-
tory glycine from mesophyll (M) to bundle sheath (BS) tissues 
where the photorespiratory enzyme glycine decarboxylase is

localized (Monson and Rawsthorne, 2000). This CCM is now 
termed C2 photosynthesis (Sage et al., 2012).
In reviewing the literature on C 3 × C 4 hybrids, the most 
attractive system seems to be the cross between A. rosea and 
A.  prostrata (Björkman et  al., 1969). An appealing aspect 
of this system is that the axile inflorescences of A. rosea are 
entirely composed of female flowers. This facilitates cross-
pollination with A.  rosea as the maternal parent because 
the bisexual inflorescences at the branch tips can be eas-
ily removed (Osmond et al., 1980). The F
1 offspring of the 
A. rosea × A. prostrata cross are fertile, although with reduced 
pollen fertility and seed set. The F
2 offspring exhibit a grada-
tion in many C4 traits, with independent assortment (Boynton 
et al., 1970). For example, no correlation is apparent between 
leaf anatomy and expression of C
4 enzymes (Boynton et al., 
1970). These findings were the first to demonstrate that 
multiple genes are involved in the expression of C
4 photo-
synthesis, and show that the loss of any one C 4 trait leads to 
breakdown of the C4 CCM (Björkman, 1976; Osmond et al., 
1980). However, chromosomal abnormalities were observed, 
with only four out of nine chromosomes regularly pairing 
at meiosis (Nobs, 1976). This precluded traditional genetic 
analysis, as forming a linkage map was impossible. The use 
of high-throughput genomics can potentially overcome this 
constraint (Bräutigam and Gowik, 2010).
To exploit the potential of C
3 × C4 hybrids in the genom-
ics era, it is necessary to produce new hybrid lines to replace 
those lost decades ago. We therefore regenerated hybrids 
between A. rosea and A. prostrata through to the F
2 genera-
tion. Here, we describe the physiology and leaf anatomy of 
these hybrids using gas exchange and biochemical assays, and 
interpret the results in light of current theory for the function 
of C
3-C4 intermediate and C4 systems.
Materials and methods
Generation of F1 and F2 hybrids
With the assistance of Olle Björkman (Fig. 1B), seeds of A. pros-
trata were collected from a salt marsh along San Francisco Bay 
in Baylands Park, Palo Alto, California USA (37°27’38.65”N × 
122°06’19.63”W). This is the same collection site for this species 
in the first hybrid trials (Björkman et al., 1969). Seeds of A. rosea 
were collected in a corral along Ball’s Canyon road, 30 km north-
west of Reno, Nevada, USA by Chris Root (39°39’20.68”N × 
120°03’19.89”W). All plants used for crosses were grown from these 
collections in a rooftop greenhouse located at the University of 
Toronto. Plants were grown in a mixture of sand, Pro-Mix (Premier 
Tech Ltd., Rivière-du-Loup, Québec, Canada), and sterilized topsoil 
(2:2:1 by volume) in either 7.6 l or 3.8 l pots. Plants were watered as 
necessary to avoid drought and fertilized weekly with a mixture con-
taining 1.8 g l
–1 of 24-8-16 Miracle-Gro All Purpose fertilizer, 1.2 g 
l–1 30-10-10 Miracle-Gro Evergreen Tree and Shrub fertilizer (Scotts 
Miracle-Gro Co., Marysville, Ohio, USA), 4.0 mM Ca(NO3)2, and 
1.0 mM MgSO4. The daytime temperature during growth was 26– 
32 ºC depending on outdoor temperature and solar insolation, and 
night temperature was approximately 23 ºC.
In A.  rosea, bisexual inflorescences are produced at the branch 
tips, whereas only female inflorescences are produced in the leaf 
axils of mature stems (Osmond et  al., 1980). A.  prostrata has 
only bisexual inflorescences. By removing the bisexual inflores-
cences from A. rosea, we were able to protect the axile flowers from 
self-pollination and ensure they would receive only pollen produced 
by A. prostrata. Flowers of A. rosea were pollinated using an extra-
fine paintbrush from August to October, 2011. F
1 hybrid seed was 
mature when plants senesced in mid-to-late November, 2011. F 1 
hybrids were grown in identical environments as the parents, using 
high-pressure sodium lamps to maintain photoperiod at 14 h. These 
plants flowered beginning in mid-August and were allowed to self-
pollinate, with seeds maturing by late October.
The F
2 hybrids, along with F 1, A. rosea and A. prostrata plants 
were grown in a plant growth chamber (Conviron PGC-20, Conviron 
Ltd., Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada) at 27 ºC day/22 ºC night using 
the same soil, watering, and fertilizer regime as described above. 
Photoperiod was 18 h with a light intensity near 700  µmol m
–2 s–1 
during the central 8-h portion of the photoperiod, and 200 µmol m–2 
s–1 for 4 h on each side of the high light period. One hour of incan-
descent light provided 20 µmol m–2 s–1 during the first and last hour 
of the photoperiod. We selected this photoperiod after preliminary 
trials showed plants flowered in a 14 h photoperiod.
Gas exchange, leaf nitrogen, and enzyme assays
Gas exchange measurements were conducted on 6–10-week-old 
plants, using a recently expanded leaf for all measurements. Leaf 
disks for enzyme and nitrogen assays were sampled from the leaves 
used for gas exchange. Carbon isotope ratios of leaf disks from 
adjacent leaves were determined by the University of Washington 
Isotope Facility (http://depts.washington.edu/isolab/). Whole-leaf 
gas exchange parameters were measured using a LI-6400 portable 
photosynthesis system (Li-Cor, Inc., Lincoln, Nebraska, USA) at 
a leaf temperature of 30 ºC (Vogan et al., 2007). For determination 
of the response of net CO
2 assimilation rate (A ) to intercellular 
CO2 content (C i), a saturating light intensity of 1500  µmol m–2 s–1 
was used for A. prostrata and 1800 µmol m–2 s–1 for A. rosea. In the 
measurement of the A /Ci response, leaves were first equilibrated to 
saturating light (1500  µmol m–2 s–1 for A. prostrata and 1800  µmol 
m–2 s –1 for A.  rosea) and then measurements were recorded. 
Subsequently, ambient CO 2 concentration was raised to almost 
1000 µmol mol–1 to determine the maximum assimilation rate and 
then reduced in steps to 35  µmol mol –1 for A. prostrata, 10  µmol 
mol–1 for A. rosea and 20  µmol mol –1 for the F 1 and F 2 hybrids. 
The CO2 compensation point was calculated using the x-intercept 
of a linear regression through the lowest 4–6 CO 2 concentrations 
that fell on a linear response of A  versus C i. This regression was 
also used to calculate the initial slope of the A /Ci curve, which is 
an estimate of carboxylation efficiency (CE). Leaf nitrogen was 
assayed using a Costech ESC 4010 C:N analyzer by the University 
of Nebraska Ecosystem Analysis lab, Lincoln, Nebraska (biosci.
unl.edu/facilities).
Enzyme assays were conducted at 30 ºC for Rubisco and three 
C
4 cycle enzymes: phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPCase), 
NAD malic enzyme (NAD-ME), and pyruvate phosphate diki-
nase (PPDK) (Sage et al., 2011). Leaf samples were extracted into 
50 mM HEPES buffer (pH 7.8) containing 10 mM MgCl
2, 2 mM 
MnCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 2% PVPP (w/v), 1% PVP, 1% BSA, 10 mM 
DTT, 0.5% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mM 6-aminocaproic acid, and 
2 mM benzamide. Enzyme activities were assayed with a diode 
array spectrophotometer by measuring at 340 nm the reduction of 
NAD+ (for NAD-ME), or the oxidation of NADH in a coupled 
enzyme assay (Rubisco, PEPCase, PPDK). NAD-malic enzyme 
and PEP carboxylase were assayed according to Sage et al., (2011). 
Rubisco was assayed according to Ashton et al. (1990), with the 
extract being incubated in the reaction mixture for 10 min before 
the assay to ensure full activation of the enzyme. The PPDK assay 
was modified from Ashton et  al. (1990), with 10 mM KHCO
3 
replacing NaHCO 3 and the concentration of PEPCase being 
increased to 3 units ml –1. All chemicals for enzymes assays with 
the exception of PEPCase were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich, St. 
Louis, USA. PEPCase was obtained from Bio-Research Products, 
North Liberty, Iowa, USA.

Leaf anatomy
For light and transmission microscopy, 2 mm2 samples were cut 
from the middle region of recently expanded leaves and prepared for 
microscopy as described by Sage and Williams (1995). Briefly, sec-
tions were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde and 0.5 M sodium cacodylate 
buffer solution (pH 6.9) and post-fixed with a 2% osmium tetroxide 
solution. Samples were then dehydrated in ethanol increments and 
embedded in Spurr’s resin. The microscopy samples were obtained 
from leaves adjacent to those used for gas exchange analyses, and 
were harvested in the middle of the four-week period when gas 
exchange data were acquired.
Results
Generation and growth of the F1 and F2 hybrids
Approximately 80% of A. rosea flowers that were hand-
pollinated with A. prostrata pollen yielded seed. By con-
trast, Nobs et  al., (1970) reported seed set near 10%. 
Seedlings of F
1 plants were easy to identify as they lacked 
the red colour present on the bottom of A. rosea leaves. 
The F
1 hybrids produced 50–100 F 2 seeds each, similar to 
the results of Nobs et al., (1970). The germination rate for 
F1 seeds was over 80%. The growth habit and leaf shape 
of the F 1 hybrids was intermediate between that of the 
parents and uniform compared with each other, whereas 
the F
2 hybrids were also intermediate in growth habit, but 
exhibited variable leaf shape (Supplementary Fig. S1). 
Notably, all F
1 and F 2 hybrids retained female-only inflo-
rescences in the leaf axils, as seen in the maternal parent 
A. rosea.
Gas exchange results
The F1 hybrids exhibited a CO2 compensation point (Γ) near 
30 µmol mol–1, in contrast to nearly 0 µmol mol–1 in A. rosea and 
50 µmol mol–1 in A. prostrata, at 30 °C (Fig. 2). Representative 
A/Ci responses for the parents and all hybrids are presented 
in Supplementary Fig. S2. In Fig.  2A, we show normalized 
A/Ci responses of the C3 and C4 parents, three hybrids, and for 
comparison, the C3-C4 intermediate species Flaveria floridana. 
The normalized curves demonstrate the F1 and F2 hybrids had 
a similar qualitative response as A. prostrata and F. floridana, 
with the major exception being that the hybrids had a lower 
carboxylation efficiency (CE) and CO
2 compensation point 
(Γ) than A. prostrata ( Fig. 2B; Fig 3A). The Γ  values of the 
F2 hybrids ranged from a C4-like value of 4 µmol mol–1 in F2-
114 to 45 µmol mol–1 in F2-123; Γ in most F2 hybrids clustered 
between 25–35 µmol mol–1 (Table 1; Fig. 3). At current air lev-
els of CO 2 (about 400 µmol mol–1 in Toronto), A400 values in 
the F2 hybrids ranged between 48% and 67% (average 57%) of 
the A. prostrata value (Table 1). At CO2 saturation, the differ-
ence between the mean A  value (Amax) of the F 2 hybrid lines 
and A. prostrata was less: Amax in the hybrids ranged between 
68% and 89% (mean 77%) of the C3 values (Table 1). The dif-
ference in the A400 values between the hybrids and A. prostrata 
was largely due to reduced carboxylation efficiency in the 
hybrids. The CE values ranged from 32–53% (average 44%) of 
the C
3 value in the F1 and F2 hybrids (Table 1), and exhibited 
no relationship with variation in Γ (Fig 3A). The δ13C of the 
F1 and F2 hybrids ranged from –29.3 to –27.6‰, and were con-
sistently more positive than the C3 mean of –32.2‰ (Fig. 3B).

Characterization of C3 × C4 Atriplex hybrids | 3641
These values were shifted more negative by approximately 2‰ 
units owing to an enriched fossil fuel signature in downtown 
Toronto, where the growth facilities are located. No relation-
ship was apparent between δ
13C and either Γ , A400, or A max, 
and the CE value (not shown).
Leaf nitrogen content and nitrogen-use 
efficiency
Although the C4 parent and all hybrids lines exhibited lower 
leaf nitrogen content than the C3 parent, none of their means 
were significantly different (Table 1). Differences in leaf nitro-
gen-use efficiency (NUE) between the C3 and C4 species could 
not be statistically resolved, whereas each hybrid line except F2-
109 has a significantly lower NUE than the C4 parent (Table 1). 
On average, the mean NUE of all the F2-hybrids was 31% less 
than the C3 mean and 43% less than the C4 value.
Enzyme activity
The Rubisco activity of the F 1 and F 2 hybrids was 30–50% 
of the C 3 value (Table 2). When the CE of each hybrid was

3 species (Fig.  4). The activities of 
the three major C 4 cycle enzymes — PEPC, NAD-ME, and 
PPDK — were generally low in the hybrids and in many cases 
approached the activity of the C
3 parent (Table  2). The F 1 
hybrid had significantly higher NAD-ME, PEPC, and PPDK 
activity than the C
3 parent. Five of the nine F 2 hybrids had 
significantly higher NAD-ME activities than the C 3 parent, 
whereas just three had significantly higher PPDK activi-
ties than A.  prostrata. Differences in PEPC between the F
2 
hybrids and the C3 parent could not be resolved using a one-
way ANOV A at P<0.05; however, low statistical power in the 
test weakened our ability to resolve differences in PEPC activ-
ity. Four hybrids exhibited mean PEPC activities that were 
over twice the C
3 value, and one of these, the F2-114 with the 
low, C4-like Г value, also had elevated activities of NAD-ME 
and PPDK (Table 2).
Leaf anatomy
The leaf anatomy (Fig. 5A, B) and ultrastructure (Fig. 6A, 
B) of A.  prostrata and A.  rosea were typical for C 3 and C 4 
members of the genus (Downton et al., 1969; Dengler et al., 
1995). Atriplex rosea has well-developed BS cells that are 
discontinuous on the abaxial side of the vein (see also Liu 
and Dengler, 1994). In cross-section, BS cells are triangular 
in shape, which allows them to be tightly packed against the 
vein. Enlarged chloroplasts occupy the centripetal half of 
the BS cells in A. rosea, whereas no chloroplasts occur in the 
outer-most region of the cells (Figs. 5B, 6B). This is typical for 
the Atriplicoid-type of Kranz anatomy (Dengler and Nelson, 
2000). In A. prostrata, BS chloroplasts are smaller than in the 
C
4 plants and the chloroplasts are generally positioned along 
the outer periphery of the BS cell opposite intercellular air 
spaces. In cross section, chloroplasts were infrequent along 
the inner, centripetal wall of the BS cells of A. prostrata, and 
the individual BS cells were generally circular in outline. The 
BS cells of the F
1 and F 2 hybrids were variable in size and 
shape yet typically intermediate in structure between the C 3 
and C4 condition (Figs 5, 6, and Supplementary Fig. 3). Many 
of the BS cells of both F 1 and F2 hybrids were oval in cross 
section, in contrast to the circular BS cells of A. prostrata and 
the triangular BS cells of A. rosea. This pattern resembles that 
observed in an immature leaf in A. rosea (see Fig. 4 in Liu and 
Dengler, 1994). In all hybrids, BS chloroplasts were numerous 
and arrayed all around the BS cell periphery (Figs 5 and 6). 
Chloroplast size and shape in the BS of the F
2 hybrids was 
similar to what was observed in the BS of A. prostrata (Figs 5 
and 6). In the BS cells of the hybrids, mitochondria occurred 
between chloroplasts, but did not form distinct ranks between 
elongated chloroplasts as observed in A. rosea (Fig. 6).
Discussion
Results from this study and previous research with C 3 × C 4 
hybrids demonstrate that C4 photosynthesis is disrupted in the 
hybrids, as shown by a general increase in the Γ, a reduction in 
CE and NUE, and the expression of a C3-like δ13C (Björkman

et  al., 1971b, Björkman, 1976; Osmond et  al., 1980; Brown 
and Bouton, 1993). In the hybrids generated here, we observed 
that the F1 and most F2 hybrids exhibited Γ values in the mid-
range between C3 and C4 species. However, one F2 line (#114) 
exhibited Γ values that overlap with those of C 4-like species 
such as Flaveria brownii that have a fully functional C4 cycle 
(Ku et al., 1991). A second F 2 (#123) had Γ approaching the 
C3 range. In previous studies, F1 hybrids exhibit intermediate 
Γ values; these were interpreted to reflect a mix of C 3 and C4 
biochemistry in the F1 leaf (Pearcy and Björkman, 1971). The 
F
1 hybrids are diploid with one set of chromosomes from each 
parent, and therefore have one C 3 copy and one C 4 copy of 
each gene, resulting in the mixed physiology (Osmond et al., 
1980). In F 2 lines, trait segregation is apparent, and hybrids 
probably lose one or more of the genes essential for C 4 func-
tion (Osmond et al., 1980; Brown and Bouton, 1993). In F 3 
lines, further segregation leads to most hybrids exhibiting C3-
like photosynthetic characteristics (Björkman et  al., 1971a, 
b). Occasionally, however, F3 hybrids exhibit Γ  values close 
to the C 4 value (Björkman, 1976), which is consistent with 
results from F2-114. Previous hybrid studies indicate that all 
parts of the C4 biochemical cycle and Kranz anatomy must be 
present for efficient C4 function (Björkman, 1976; Brown and 
Bouton, 1993). As these traits independently segregate (Brown 
and Bouton, 1993), the probability of an F2 hybrid acquiring 
all of the C 4 traits is low, and hence, it is unlikely that full 
C4 photosynthesis can occur. However, Γ values in the mid-
range between C3 and C4 plants demonstrate the existence of a

CCM in the F2 lines. This could result from either a modest C4 
metabolic pump or a C 2-type CCM where photorespiratory 
glycine is shuttled into the BS cells (Brown and Bouton, 1993). 
With new hybrids, we are now in a position to evaluate these 
possibilities and develop working hypotheses to guide future 
hybrid studies. In our discussion of the F
2 hybrids, we mainly 
focus on F2-114, whose C4-like Γ value indicates greater CCM 
activity.
In F2-114, the low, C4-like Γ is indicative of significant C 4 
cycle activity and/or a highly effective C 2 CCM. F2-114 had 
activities of PEPC, PPDK and NAD-ME that were 12–30% 
of the C
4 values, indicating the potential for a modest C 4 
cycle that could contribute to a reduction in Γ  by supplying 
some CO2 to the BS. All other F 2 hybrids in this study had 
C3-like activities in at least one of these enzymes, indicat-
ing low potential for more than minor C 4 cycle activity. As 
shown by Type II C3-C4 intermediates (those with significant 
C2 photosynthesis and C 4 metabolism; Edwards and Ku, 
1987), modest C 4 cycle activity combined with a C 2-type of 
glycine shuttle is sufficient to reduce Γ  below 10 µmol mol–1. 
In the Type II C 3-C4 intermediate F. ramosissima, for exam-
ple, a Γ of 7 µmol mol–1 was associated with C4 enzyme activ-
ities between 12% and 18% of C 4 values (Ku et al., 1983). 
A 3.5‰ increase in δ 13C in F2-114 relative to A. prostrata is 
also evidence for modest C 4 cycle activity, and is consistent 
with observed δ 13C values of Type II intermediates such as 
F. ramossissima, and with modelled increases in δ13C assum-
ing a 20–30% contribution by PEPC to the BS CO2 pool and 
moderate CO2 leakage (Monson et al., 1988; von Caemmerer, 
1992; Sudderth et al., 2007). However, C4 metabolism could 
not contribute a large amount of carbon to the final pool of 
photosynthate in F
2-114, because the δ13C values would shift 
more towards the C4 values than observed (von Caemmerer, 
1992). We therefore hypothesize that the low Γ  in F 2-114 
reflects a large contribution of a glycine shuttle to the CO 2 
pool of its BS cells.

Characterization of C3 × C4 Atriplex hybrids | 3645
Because C2 species with no C4-cycle activity (the type I C3-C4 
intermediates; Edwards and Ku, 1987) exhibit Г values above 
15 µmol mol–1 (Edwards and Ku, 1987; Ku et al., 1991; Vogan 
et al., 2007) it seems unlikely that a C2-type of glycine shuttle 
could reduce Γ to 4 µmol mol–1 by itself. However, according 
to von Caemmerer’s model of C 3-C4 intermediate photosyn-
thesis (von Caemmerer, 1989), a C 4-like Γ could occur in a 
pure C2 species if there is an elevated (20%) fraction of leaf 
Rubisco in the BS cells, the conductance to CO2 leakage in the 
BS is low, and nearly all of the photorespired CO2 is released 
into the BS cells. Given the segregation of traits in the F2 lines 
(Osmond et al., 1980), it is probable that these criteria could 
be met in a few hybrids. All of the F 2 hybrids here exhibited 
Rubisco activities that are a third to a half that of the A. pros-
trata parent, indicating some C 4-type control over Rubisco 
expression is present in the hybrid lines. C 4 species produce 
25–35% as much Rubisco as C3 species (Sage et al., 1987), as 
is demonstrated by lower Rubisco activity in A. rosea relative 
to A. prostrata. Although we do not know where the Rubisco 
is distributed in our hybrids, previous work demonstrates F
1 
and F3 hybrids of A. rosea × A. prostrata express Rubisco in 
all chlorenchymatous cells (Hattersley et al., 1977). The high 
number of plastids in the BS of the F 2 hybrids also indicates 
significant amounts of Rubisco are present in their BS chlo-
roplasts. With respect to BS conductance, we hypothesize that 
some hybrids, perhaps including F
2-114, have inherited traits 
contributing to low, C 4-like conductance in the BS, such as 
thick BS cell walls (von Caemmerer and Furbank, 2003). It 
is also likely that there is a high fraction of photorespiratory 
CO
2 released in the BS of most hybrids. In C4 plants, photores-
piratory glycine decarboxylase (GDC) is localized to BS cells, 
whereas in C
3 plants, GDC and the photorespiratory cycle is 
expressed in both BS and M tissues (Muhaidat et  al. 2011; 
Sage et al. 2011; Schulze et al. 2013). In an F2 hybrid, there is a 
good chance that one or more of the GDC subunits exhibit a 
C
4 pattern and are not expressed in the M cells, whereas their 
expression in the BS cells would occur if either the C 4 or C 3 
pattern were inherited. Hence, it is probable that GDC activity 
is low in the M tissues of the F
2 hybrids and high in the BS, 
so that much of the photorespiratory glycine would have to 
migrate into the BS for decarboxylation. This would explain 
why most of the F
2 lines have C2-like Γ values. Certain lines, 
such as F2-123 with a more C3-like Γ may have a leakier BS or 
relatively less Rubisco in the BS, whereas other lines with low 
Γ such as F
2-114 may have proportionally more BS Rubisco 
or less BS leakiness, plus some contribution from a C 4 cycle. 
These possibilities point to a need for enzyme localization and 
leakage assessments in future hybrid studies.
In most hybrids, it is apparent that the BS Rubisco is ade-
quately supplied with CO
2. When carboxylation efficiency is 
plotted as a function of Rubisco activity, the hybrid values 
clustered around the theoretical relationship between Rubisco 
activity and carboxylation efficiency of a C
3 Atriplex-like plant 
(Fig. 4). This demonstrates that in most hybrids, Rubisco is on 
average operating with the same efficiency as in a C3 leaf. The 
CE of F 2-109 sits well above the CE versus Rubisco activity 
plot, which would occur if much of its Rubisco is in a CO 2-
enriched environment. The low PEPC and PPDK activity in 
F2-109 indicates the reduction of Γ below C3 values is predom-
inately due to CO 2 influx into the BS via C 2 photosynthesis. 
Hybrid F2-114 exhibits the lowest CE relative to the theoreti-
cal CE versus Rubisco plot, demonstrating that at least some 
of its Rubisco is operating with reduced efficiency. Low CO
2 
levels in the BS would reduce CE, but this would not result in 
the low Γ value of F
2-114 because Rubisco oxygenase activity 
would increase at low CO2 and raise Γ. Alternatively, Rubisco 
may be limited by low RuBP regeneration capacity, or a low 
activation state owing to a lack of Rubisco activase. Low RuBP 
regeneration might result if a C
4 pattern of thylakoid pro-
tein expression corresponded to a C3 pattern of Calvin cycle 
expression, in which case one of the C 3 compartments could 
be energy limited. The potential lack of activase expression is 
an intriguing possibility that could not be considered in the 
first era of Atriplex hybrid studies, as activase was unknown at 
the time. In C
4 plants, activase expression is four times higher 
in the BS than M tissue (Majeran et al., 2005). In the hybrids, 
a C4-like pattern of activase expression could leave Rubisco in 
the M cells in a partially deactivated state. This would explain 
the low CE in F
2-114, as the M Rubisco could be deactivated 
and unable to contribute to the CE values.
Anatomical patterns
Anatomically, all of the hybrid lines failed to express the 
well-developed Atriplicoid-type of Kranz anatomy, as has 
been noted before (Boynton et al., 1970). Atriplicoid Kranz 
anatomy consists of enlarged BS cells with a surround-
ing layer of M cells (Liu and Dengler, 1994; Dengler and 
Nelson, 1999). Chloroplasts in the BS cells of A. rosea are 
elongated and fill the inner two-thirds of the BS, and have 
many mitochondria distributed along the sides of the chlo-
roplasts (Fig.  6). No chloroplasts or mitochondria occur 
along the outer BS wall of C
4 Atriplex species. This arrange-
ment allows for rapid re-assimilation of CO 2 released by 
NAD-ME in the mitochondria, with the vacuole of the 
outer BS providing significant resistance to CO
2 efflux 
(von Caemmerer and Furbank, 2003). By contrast, the C 3 
A. prostrata produces small BS chloroplasts that are simi-
lar to M cell chloroplasts; these occur along the outer wall 
of the BS cell against the intercellular air spaces (Boynton 
et al., 1970). In all the hybrids, the BS chloroplasts are simi-
lar in size and shape to those of the C
3 parent, yet their 
positioning resembles a pattern that is often observed in C 2-
type species, where chloroplasts can occur in both a centrip-
etal and centrifugal position (Muhaidat et  al., 2011; Sage 
et al., 2013). Mitochondria still occur between chloroplasts, 
but to less of a degree than seen in A. rosea. Many of the 
mitochondria in the hybrids also appear between the inner 
BS wall and the chloroplasts, resembling a pattern appar -
ent in C
3-C4 intermediate plants using the C 2-type of CCM 
(Monson and Rawsthorne, 2000; Sage et  al., 2011; 2013). 
These observations further indicate that the BS cells of the 
F
2 hybrids use the C2 mode of photosynthesis, although this 
will depend upon whether enough GDC is present in the BS 
mitochondria to create a strong sink for glycine produced in 
the M tissue.

Stomatal control
Previous work with C 3 × C 4 hybrids did not emphasize 
stomatal control, due in part to incomplete understand-
ing at the time of stomatal regulation in C 3 and C 4 spe-
cies. It is now known that non-stressed C 3 species regulate 
Ci/Ca to generally be between 0.7–0.8 under humid condi-
tions, whereas in C 4 plants, C i/Ca is maintained between 
0.4–0.6 (Wong et al., 1979; Taylor et al. 2011; Vogan and 
Sage, 2011). The lower Ci/Ca in C 4 species reflects tighter 
stomatal control and increased carboxylation efficiency of 
the C
4 pathway relative to C 3 photosynthesis; this explains 
the greater water-use efficiency of C 4 plants (Huxman and 
Monson, 2003; Vogan and Sage, 2011). Under the relatively 
low vapour pressure difference between leaf and air in this 
study, we observed C
i/Ca to be 0.57 in A. rosea and 0.80 in 
A. prostrata. In the hybrids, the C i/Ca values have largely 
reverted to the C3 value (Ci/Ca of 0.71–0.81), indicating that 
a full complement of C 4 machinery is required for a C 4 pat-
tern of stomatal control.
Conclusions
With the new C 3 × C4 hybrids in Atriplex, we have re-estab-
lished an important system for investigating the genetic 
control and physiological function of C
4 photosynthesis. In 
the F2 lines, we demonstrate a loss of efficient C 4 function, 
further supporting the hypothesis that all of the compo-
nents of the C
4 pathway must be in place for C 4 photosyn-
thesis to occur. Although impairment of C 4 photosynthesis 
in the F 2 hybrids is no surprise, an intriguing observation 
is that improper assembly of the C 3 pathway is also appar -
ent in most F 2 hybrids. This may reflect incomplete expres-
sion of the photorespiratory pathway in the M cells of the 
hybrids, or mismatched compartmentalization of C
3 pho-
tosynthetic components. Ironically, with the incomplete 
assembly of the C
3 and C 4 conditions in the F 2 lines, the 
default state seems to be C 2 photosynthesis, for what may 
be a rather simple reason. Because both C 3 and C 4 plants 
express GDC in the BS (Schulze et al., 2013), the probabil-
ity is high that GDC of the F 2 hybrids is abundant in the BS 
cells, whereas GDC levels in the M cells may be low owing 
to inheritance of C
4 expression patterns for at least one of 
the four GDC subunits. Hence, glycine would have to flow 
to the BS for decarboxylation, to the benefit of Rubisco in 
the BS chloroplasts.
We have now successfully generated the F
3 hybrids and will 
be producing F4 lines and beyond to further segregate traits 
and possibly create near isogenic lines. With the analytical 
capabilities provided by modern tools and theory, we are bet-
ter positioned to evaluate genetic, biochemical, and structural 
limitations affecting photosynthesis in the hybrids and hence 
provide critical information that can be utilized to engineer 
C
4 photosynthesis into C 3 crops as well as understand the 
evolution of C 4 photosynthesis. These were the initial goals 
of Olle Björkman, John Boynton, Malcolm Nobs, and Bob 
Pearcy in the late 1960s when the initial hybrids were created. 
In the near future, these goals may be realized.
