Abstract: This study compared the growth, carcass properties, fatty acid profile, lipid-producing
enzyme activity, and expression pattern of genes involved in fat metabolism in Nanyang and Landrace
pigs. In the study, 32 Nanyang (22.16 ± 0.59 kg) and 32 Landrace barrows (21.37 ± 0.57 kg) were
selected and divided into two groups, each with eight pens and four pigs per pen. The trial period
lasted 90 days. The findings showed that the Nanyang pigs had lower average daily weight gain and
lean percentage and higher average backfat thickness and lipogenic enzyme activities, including for
acetyl-CoA carboxylase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, malic enzyme, and fatty acid synthase,
than the Landrace pigs. A total of 14 long-chain fatty acids were detected using HPLC-MS, in which
it was found that the levels of C14:0, C18:1n-9, C20:1n-9, C20:4n-6, and MUFA were up-regulated
and C18:2n-6, C18:3n-3, PUFA n6, n3/n6, and total PUFA were down-regulated in the Nanyang pigs.
Moreover, the mRNA levels for genes involved in fat metabolism, ME1, FAS, and LPL, were higher
and the expression of SREBP1 mRNA was lower in the Nanyang pigs. Our results suggest genetic
differences between the pig breeds in terms of growth, carcass traits, lipogenic enzyme activities,
fatty acid profile, and the mRNA expression of genes involved in fat metabolism in subcutaneous fat
tissue, which may provide a basis for high-quality pork production. Further studies are needed to
investigate the regulation of lipid metabolism.
Keywords: pigs; lipogenic enzyme; fatty acid profile; fat deposition; subcutaneous fat tissue; gene expression
1. Introduction
In China, with the increase in living standards, high-quality pork is highly favored by
the consumer market. However, the current market supply of high-quality pork cannot
meet the needs of consumers. Fat deposition is a vital factor affecting pork quality and is
related to meat appearance, flavor, juiciness, tenderness, and processing characteristics, as
well as human health [1]. It is well known that cardiovascular disease is closely related to
dietary fat intake and fatty acid composition [2]. Animal body fat, including subcutaneous,
abdominal, intermuscular, and intramuscular fat, is distributed in different parts of the
body. Therefore, exploring the molecular mechanism of fat deposition has great significance
for high-quality pork production. In addition to nutritional levels, age, weight, gender, and
environment, fat deposition is influenced by the breeds of the pigs [ 3–5]. Local pigs are
known to produce high-quality pork due to having a higher capacity for fat deposition than
modern commercial breeds [6]. Zhao et al. [7] found that the terminal body weight (BW) and
the hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL) activity in longissimus dorsi muscles were lower, and
the backfat thickness, lean fat weight, and fatty acid synthase (FAS) activity in longissimus
dorsi muscles were greater in Mashen pigs than in Large White pigs. The mRNA expression

Genes 2024, 15, 186 2 of 10
of CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein α (C/EBPα), C/EBPβ, and peroxisome proliferator-
activated receptor γ (PP ARγ) in longissimus dorsi muscles was increased in Mashen pigs
compared to Large White pigs. There was no difference in the sterol regulatory element-
binding protein 1 (SREBP1) mRNA levels in longissimus lumborum muscles between these
two breeds. Another study evaluated the effects of genetics on the fat amount and fatty acid
composition in Iberian and Landrace × Large White pigs and found that the swine genetic
type had an important influence on the fatty acid profile of the outer and inner backfat
layers. The monounsaturated fatty acid (MUFA) level in Iberian pigs at 115 kg in the two
layers was greater than that in Landrace × Large White pigs [8]. Zhang et al. [ 9] found
that Bamei pigs had a greater capacity for fat deposition than Landrace pigs, owing to
the function of pre-adipocytes; the adipogenesis induced by glucose was greater in Bamei
pigs than in Landrace pigs. Although there have been several studies on fat deposition in
different varieties of pigs, a deeper understanding of the underlying hereditary effects of
fat deposition in pigs can be achieved through further in-depth study.
The Nanyang pig is an ancient breed distributed in the Nanyang area of Henan
Province in China. It is early maturing, fattens easily, and is a medium-sized meat fat dual-
use-type breed. It is a Chinese local pig breed famous for its stable genetic characteristics,
strong and robust physique, strong adaptability, disease resistance, and delicious meat. A
previous study carried out proteome analyses on longissimus dorsi and backfat tissues
from two groups of Nanyang pigs with different fat deposition efficiencies and identified
15 candidate genes determining lipid deposition, in which FASN, CAT, and SLC25A20 were
the most prominent; the findings indicated that the Nanyang pig is an optimal animal
model to investigate high meat quality and fast fat deposition mechanisms in pigs [ 10].
The Landrace pig is a common commercial variety known for its high growth speed and
lean carcass. In this study, we posit that a better understanding of these two breeds’
differences would be helpful to clarify the distinction in fat deposition mechanisms in pigs
of different genetic backgrounds and provide a basis for high-quality pork production.
Therefore, we investigate the differences in the growth performance, carcass properties,
fatty acid profile, lipid-producing enzyme activity, and expression of genes involved in fat
metabolism between Nanyang and Landrace pigs.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Animals, Experimental Design, Diets, and Management
The pig-rearing procedure was approved by the Animal Protection and Utilization Com-
mittee of Henan Institute of Science and Technology (No. 2020HIST004, 02/04/2020, Xinxiang,
China). A total of 64 barrows (32 Nanyang pigs, average body weight: 22.16± 0.59 kg,and
32 Landrace pigs, average body weight: 21.37 ± 0.57 kg) were selected from Xinda Hus-
bandry Development Co., Ltd. (Luoyang, Henan Province, China). Each variety had
8 pens, with 4 pigs per pen. The pigs in the 16 pens were reared in a hog house and fed
with the same commodity feed; the ingredients and nutrient contents are presented in
Table 1. During the experiment, the pigs were free to feed and drink water ad libitum.
Daily management was carried out in accordance with the company’s procedures. After
5 days of pre-testing, the trial period lasted 90 days. In the whole experiment, the feed
consumed and the residual feed were measured daily, and then the initial BW, final BW,
average daily weight gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed/gain ratio
(F/G) of the pigs were determined.
2.2. Sample Collection
At the end of the experiment, 16 pigs (2 pigs per pen, close to the average weight of
their breed group) in each breed were selected; after weighing, the animals were fasted for
twelve hours, given free access to water, and then slaughtered after electrical stunning at a
commercial abattoir according to Chinese standard industry procedures. After slaughter,
each carcass was weighed, and then the average backfat depth at the 1st rib, 1st lumbar,
and last lumbar vertebrae was calculated using a sliding caliper in the midline at the right
Genes 2024, 15, 186 3 of 10
carcass sides [11]. The loin muscle area was measured at the transversal surface of the
longissimus lumborum between the last thoracic vertebra and first lumbar vertebra using
a sliding caliper (width × thickness × 0.7, cm2). The lean meat percent was calculated
according to the formula (lean weight ÷ carcass weight × 100%). Approximately 100 g
of subcutaneous fat from the outer backfat layer at the 13th rib on the right side of the
carcass was obtained immediately post mortem and kept at −80 ◦C for further testing of
the fatty acid profile, lipid-producing enzyme activity, and expression of genes involved in
fat metabolism [12].

2.3. Assay of Lipid-Producing Enzyme Activities in Subcutaneous Fat Tissue
The activities of acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC, EC6.4.1.2), malic enzyme (ME, EC
1.1.1.40), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH, EC 1.1.1.49), and FAS (EC 2.3.1.85)
in the subcutaneous fat tissue were determined according to Gerfault et al. [ 13]. All of
the enzyme assays were determined in triplicate. Then, 1 g of frozen subsample from the
collected subcutaneous fat tissue was immediately homogenized in 0.25 M sucrose solution
on ice, and then centrifuged for 30 min at 30,000× g and 4 ◦C. Next, the supernatants were
collected to detect the lipogenic enzyme activities using the colorimetric method according
to the producer’s manual (Nanjing Jiancheng Bioengineering Institute, Nanjing, China).
One unit of G6PDH and ME activity was determined as the enzymes production of 1 nmol
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) min −1·g sample−1, resulting
from the reduction in NADP +. ACC reacts with acetyl-CoA and ATP: the products are
malonyl-CoA, ADP , and inorganic phosphorus, and its activity was defined as the enzyme
generating 1 nmol of PO43−·g sample−1 per hour as one unit. The FAS activity was defined
as 1 nmol of NADPH oxidized to NADP+ min−1·g sample−1 as one unit.
2.4. Assay of Fatty Acid Profile in Subcutaneous Fat Tissue
Fatty acid samples from the subcutaneous fat tissue (0.05 g) were prepared according to
Folch et al. [14], put into 10 mL centrifuge tubes, and obtained by mixing a solution of 5 mL
chloroform/methanol (2:1 v/v) for two hours after homogenizing. Next, 5 mL of distilled
Genes 2024, 15, 186 4 of 10
water was added and mixed well, and the mixed solution was centrifuged for 5 min at
3000× g and 25 ◦C. Finally, the supernatants were discarded, and the lower solutions were
dried with negative pressure. The methylation of fatty acids followed this procedure: 1 mL
of n-hexane was added and swung for 25 min at 40 ◦C, and then 1 mL KOH-methanol
solution (0.4 mol/L) was added; after standing for 25 min, the mixtures were shaken
for 2 h. Then, 2 mL of deionized water was added and blended, and centrifugation for
5 min at 3000 × g was carried out. The supernatant was collected and detected using
high-performance liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) for the analysis
of the fatty acid profile. The HPLC-MS was performed on a SCIEX QTRAP 4500 mass
spectrometer (Applied Biosystems, Framingham, MA, USA) coupled with an Agilent
1260 Infinity HPLC system (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). The mobile
phases consisted of acetonitrile (A) and isopropanol (B). The procedure of gradient elution
(0–10 min, 100% B; 11–30 min, 70% B; 31–120 min, 50% B) was performed at a flow rate
of 0.2 mL/min; 10 µL of the sample was injected into the chromatographic system. Mass
spectrometry was carried out under atmospheric pressure chemical ionization in positive
ion mode (APCI+); spray voltage, 1.5 kV; capillary temperature, 300 ◦C; MS scanning range,
50−1200 amu; scanning rate, 50 amu/s. The result of the fatty acid analysis was described
by g fatty acids/100 g of detected fatty acid methyl esters. All of the fatty acid assays were
conducted in triplicate.
2.5. Assay of Quantitative Real-Time PCR
The isolation of total RNA from the subcutaneous fat tissues was performed with
TRIzol (Invitrogen, Waltham, MA, USA) according to the producer’s manual. The quantity
and quality of the obtained RNA were evaluated with a NanoPhotometer ® spectropho-
tometer (Implen, Westlake Village, CA, USA; 1.8 < OD260/OD280 < 2.0). The cDNA
synthesis was performed with AMV reverse transcriptase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).
The mRNAs of adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), SREBP1, leptin (LEP), malic enzyme
1 (ME1), FAS, hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL), and lipoprotein lipase (LPL) were selected
for the detection of the expression profiles of genes involved in fat metabolism. The primer
pairs were designed for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), as presented in Table 2. The
qRT-PCRs were performed with the QuantiFast SYBR® Green RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Hilden,
Germany) according to the producer’s manual. The mRNA expression level of these genes
was determined using the 2–△△Ct method [15], with β-actin as a housekeeping gene. The
assays of the genes involved in fat metabolism were carried out in triplicate.

4. Discussion 
We found that the Nanyang pigs had lower ﬁnal BW, ADG, carcass weight, loin mus-
cle area, and lean percentage compared with the Landrace pigs, but had greater F/G and 
average backfat thickness. These ﬁndings are consistent with those in previous research 
[9,16–19] in which native pig breeds (Iberian, Creole, Bamei, Iberian, Meishan) displayed 
a lower tendency for growth and better capacity for fat deposition than modern pig breeds 
(Landrace, Large White, Duroc). Miao et al. [20] studied Jinhua and Landrace pigs and 
found a lower carcass lean percentage and gr eater carcass fat frequency in Jinhua pigs 
than in Landrace pigs. Gispert et al. [21] studied ﬁve breeds of pigs (Large White, Land-
race, Duroc, Pietrain, and Meishan) and discovered that pigs from the Chinese local breed, 
Meishan, had lower growth potential and carcass lean meat. Similar results were found 
for the growth and carcass trai ts of pigs with breed-speci ﬁc patterns when Iberian [17], 
Creole [16], Alentejana [22], and Bamei [9] pigs were compared with modern pig breeds. 
Lipogenesis is principally carried out in th e fat tissue of pigs and depends on the 
activities of enzymes [1,23,24]. In this research, we identi ﬁed that the Nanyang pigs had 
higher lipogenic enzyme activities, such as ACC, G6PDH, ME, and FAS activity, than

4. Discussion
We found that the Nanyang pigs had lower final BW, ADG, carcass weight, loin muscle
area, and lean percentage compared with the Landrace pigs, but had greater F/G and average
backfat thickness. These findings are consistent with those in previous research [9,16–19]
in which native pig breeds (Iberian, Creole, Bamei, Iberian, Meishan) displayed a lower
tendency for growth and better capacity for fat deposition than modern pig breeds (Lan-
drace, Large White, Duroc). Miao et al. [20] studied Jinhua and Landrace pigs and found
a lower carcass lean percentage and greater carcass fat frequency in Jinhua pigs than in
Landrace pigs. Gispert et al. [21] studied five breeds of pigs (Large White, Landrace, Duroc,
Pietrain, and Meishan) and discovered that pigs from the Chinese local breed, Meishan,
had lower growth potential and carcass lean meat. Similar results were found for the
growth and carcass traits of pigs with breed-specific patterns when Iberian [17], Creole [16],
Alentejana [22], and Bamei [9] pigs were compared with modern pig breeds.
Lipogenesis is principally carried out in the fat tissue of pigs and depends on the
activities of enzymes [1,23,24]. In this research, we identified that the Nanyang pigs had
higher lipogenic enzyme activities, such as ACC, G6PDH, ME, and FAS activity, than those
of the Landrace pigs. ACC is an important rate-limiting enzyme for malonyl coenzyme
A synthesis, which is the first phase of adipose biosynthesis, and is also an enzyme that
effectively inhibits mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation through the regulation of carnitine
palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1) [25]. FAS is the core enzyme needed for the transformation
of carbohydrates into fatty acids, and it catalyzes the transformation of acetyl coenzyme A
and malonyl coenzyme A into fatty acids in the presence of NADPH [26]. ME and G6PDH
are important enzymes required to provide NADPH for the reductive biosynthesis of fatty
acids [27,28]. Freire et al. found that the ACC (three- and nine-fold), ME (six- and five-fold),
and G6PDH (four- and five-fold) increased significantly more in the dorsal subcutaneous
and perirenal fat of Alentejano piglets than in Large White piglets [ 29]. Another study
showed that the function of lipid-producing enzymes (FAS, ME, and G6PDH) was greater
in the subcutaneous backfat tissue of Iberian pigs than that in Landrace × Large White
pigs [30]. The breed-specific differences in the key lipogenic enzymes in this study are
similar to those found in previous studies [26–30].
Our study revealed significant differences between the Nanyang and Landrace pigs in
terms of MUFAs and PUFAs. There were significantly more MUFAs in the Nanyang pigs
Genes 2024, 15, 186 8 of 10
than in the Landrace pigs, mainly because of the addition of oleic acid (C18:1 n-9). The
Nanyang pigs had significantly lower PUFA levels compared to the Landrace pigs, mainly
due to the variations in linoleic acid (C18:2 n-6). These findings are in agreement with those
in Barea’s research, which reported that Iberian barrows had higher MUFA levels and lower
SFA levels than Landrace × Large White barrows in the subcutaneous outer fat both at 50
and 115 kg of body weight [8]. The MUFA content was greater in Iberian pigs at 115 kg
body weight in both the outer and inner backfat, and PUFAs and C18:2 n-6 were higher
in both layers (along with body weight) in Landrace × Large White barrows [8]. Another
study found a higher content of MUFAs and lower PUFA levels in Pulawska pigs than
those in Polish Landrace pigs, demonstrating that the genetic type had a vital function in
the fatty acid profile [31]. The PUFA n-6/n-3 ratio is a valuable indicator for evaluating the
nutritional quality of meat. A previous study showed that a low PUFA n-6/n-3 ratio (4:1)
diet increased piglets’ weaning survival rate and weight gain, and improved the piglets’
health [32]. In this paper, interestingly, we found that the Nanyang pigs had a lower PUFA
n-6/n-3 ratio (6.90:1) in subcutaneous backfat tissue than the Landrace pigs (9.72:1), which
may mean that the former has higher nutritive value. However, no significant differences in
the PUFA n-3 or SFAs between the Nanyang and Landrace pigs were detected in this study.
We found that the contents of LEP, ME1, FAS, and LPL mRNA were significantly
up-regulated and the SREBP1 mRNA contents were significantly down-regulated in the
Nanyang pigs compared to the Landrace pigs, with no significant difference in the content
of ATGL and HSL mRNA being observed between them. Benítez et al. found that LEP, ME1,
and FAS had higher expression and ATGL lower expression in the subcutaneous adipose
tissue from Iberian pigs compared to Duroc pigs, showing that the Iberian pigs had a more
stable expression of lipogenic genes [19]. Xing et al. identified the differential expression
of genes in backfat tissue between Songliao and Landrace pigs using high-throughput
sequencing, and found that the ACC increased significantly and LEP decreased significantly
in Songliao pigs compared to Landrace pigs [33]. In another study, the SREBP-1c, FAS, and
ACC1 (on d 10) mRNA expression levels were increased in the subcutaneous fat of Bamei
pigs compared to in Landrace pigs [9]. In this paper, genes involved in fat metabolism were
identified, and they may explain the phenotypic differences observed between Nanyang
and Landrace pigs.
5. Conclusions
In the present paper, we demonstrated the phenotypic differences between Nanyang
and Landrace pigs in terms of growth, carcass traits, fatty acid profile, lipogenic enzyme
activities, and expression of mRNAs involved in fat metabolism in subcutaneous fat tissue,
which might explain the differences in fat deposition linked to different breeds of pigs. This
paper provides references for the future breeding of native breeds and for high-quality pork
production. Further studies to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of lipid metabolism, so
as to reduce the fatness of Nanyang pigs, have practical implications.
