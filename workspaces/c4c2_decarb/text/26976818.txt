Abstract
One of the hallmarks of C4 plants is the division of labor between two different photosynthetic cell types, the mesophyll 
and the bundle sheath cells. C 4 plants are of polyphyletic origin and, during the evolution of C 4 photosynthesis, the 
expression of thousands of genes was altered and many genes acquired a cell type-specific or preferential expression 
pattern. Several lines of evidence, including computational modeling and physiological and phylogenetic analyses, 
indicate that alterations in the expression of a key photorespiration-related gene, encoding the glycine decarboxylase 
P subunit, was an early and important step during C4 evolution. Restricting the expression of this gene to the bundle 
sheath led to the establishment of a photorespiratory CO 2 pump. We were interested in whether the expression of 
genes related to photorespiration remains bundle sheath specific in a fully optimized C 4 species. Therefore we ana-
lyzed the expression of photorespiratory and C4 cycle genes using RNA in situ hybridization and transcriptome analy-
sis of isolated mesophyll and bundle sheath cells in the C4 grass Sorghum bicolor. It turns out that the C4 metabolism 
of Sorghum is based solely on the NADP-dependent malic enzyme pathway. The majority of photorespiratory gene 
expression, with some important exceptions, is restricted to the bundle sheath.
Key words:  C4 photosynthesis, CO2 fixation, differential gene expression, evolution, photorespiration, Sorghum bicolor.
Introduction
C4 plants evolved multiple times from C 3 ancestors. The 
C4 photosynthetic pathway leads to concentration of CO 2 
around the main carboxylating enzyme ribulose-1,5-bispho -
sphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RubisCO). This is achieved 
by a set of anatomical and biochemical modifications to the 
original C3 pathway ( Hatch, 1987). In the presence of high 
CO2 concentrations, the oxygenase activity of RubisCO, 
which always competes with the carboxylation reaction, is 
effectively suppressed and hence photorespiration is strongly 
reduced in C4 plants (Hatch, 1987). Photorespiration occurs 
when O2 is used by RubisCO, which leads to the production 
of 2-phosphoglycolate (2-PG), a compound which is toxic for 
the plant cell and which needs to be detoxified ( Anderson, 
1971). Photorespiration takes place in chloroplasts, peroxi -
somes, and mitochondria. Throughout the regeneration of 
phosphoglycerate from phosphoglycolate, previously fixed

CO2 is lost and additional energy and reduction equivalents 
are needed. Hence photorespiration can reduce the effi -
ciency of photosynthesis in C 3 species by up to 30% ( Ogren, 
1984; Bauwe et al., 2010; Raines, 2011; Fernie et al., 2013). 
Therefore, C4 photosynthesis can be of great advantage in 
conditions that promote photorespiration, such as hot, arid, 
and saline environments, in which plants have to close their 
stomata in order to avoid water loss through transpiration 
but which in consequence hinders the uptake of CO 2 (Sage, 
2004). C4 plants can keep their stomata closed for a longer 
time, because the CO 2 pump facilitates high rates of photo -
synthesis even under low CO2 concentrations in the intercel -
lular air space of the leaf and therefore minimizes water loss.
Leaves of C4 plants show anatomical differences compared 
with those of C3 plants. The vascular bundles are surrounded 
by organelle-rich bundle sheath cells, which, in turn, are sur-
rounded by mostly one layer of mesophyll cells. This leads 
to a wreath-like appearance, which is termed Kranz anat -
omy ( Haberlandt, 1904; Laetsch, 1974 ). In C 4 leaves, bun -
dle sheath cells are enlarged and the interveinal distance is 
reduced (Dengler and Nelson, 1999 ). To allow the efficient 
interchange of metabolites between mesophyll and bundle 
sheath cells, both cell types are connected through numerous 
plasmodesmata (Botha, 1992).
In most species, C4 photosynthesis largely depends on the 
division of labor between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells, 
in which the CO 2 assimilatory enzymes are compartmental -
ized. The C 4 pathway begins with the conversion of CO 2 to 
bicarbonate by carbonic anhydrase (CA) in the cytosol of 
mesophyll cells and the subsequent fixation into the C 4 acid 
oxaloacetate by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) 
with the 3-carbon compound phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as 
CO2 acceptor. Afterwards, oxaloacetate is either reduced to 
malate or transaminated to aspartate, which is transported to 
the bundle sheath cells. There, CO2 is released by decarboxyla-
tion of the C4 compounds through a decarboxylating enzyme, 
either an NADP-dependent malic enzyme (NADP-ME), 
an NAD-dependent malic enzyme (NAD-ME), a PEP-
carboxykinase (PEP-CK), or, as shown recently, a combi -
nation of these ( Furbank, 2011; Y . Wang et al., 2014). The 
released CO2 is immediately refixed by RubisCO and enters 
the Calvin–Benson cycle. Less RubisCO is needed compared 
with C3 plants as it works more efficiently under these condi-
tions (Long, 1999). This results in a better nitrogen use effi -
ciency of C4 plants, since RubisCO is by far the most abundant 
protein in the leaves of higher plants (Long, 1999). Pyruvate, 
the other product of the decarboxylation, is transferred to the 
mesophyll cells where PEP is regenerated by pyruvate phos -
phate dikinase (PPDK).
C4 photosynthesis has evolved at least 66 times indepen -
dently from the original C3 pathway (Sage et al., 2011, 2012). 
To better understand the changes underlying the evolution of 
C4 on the gene level, in recent years several studies aimed at 
creating transcriptome atlases of total leaf RNA of various 
pairs of closely related C 4 and C 3 species ( Bräutigam et al., 
2011, 2014; Gowik et al., 2011; Mallmann et al., 2014). The 
development of C 3 and C 4 leaves was studied by analyzing 
the gene expression in different developmental stages of dicot 
leaves and the developmental gradients found in the leaves of 
C3 and C4 grasses (Li et al., 2010; Pick et al., 2011; Kulahoglu 
et al., 2014; L. Wang et al., 2014; Ding et al., 2015). The co-
ordination of the two different cell types was analyzed using 
mesophyll and bundle sheath transcriptomes of the C4 grasses 
maize and Setaria viridis (Li et al., 2010; Chang et al., 2012; 
John et al., 2014; Tausta et al., 2014). It turned out that C 4 
photosynthesis is a complex trait and its evolution involved 
changes in the expression of thousands of genes. Genes 
encoding the enzymes and transporters of the C4 pathway had 
to be up-regulated and acquired tissue-specific expression. In 
addition, several other metabolic pathways must also have 
been regulated differentially in mesophyll and bundle sheath 
cells to enable this efficient type of photosynthesis including 
high nitrogen and water use efficiency attributed to C4 plants.
It is widely accepted that the development of a photores -
piratory CO2 pump, often termed C 2 photosynthesis, was an 
important intermediate step during the evolution of the C 4 
pathway (Bauwe, 2011; Sage et  al., 2012; Heckmann et  al., 
2013; Williams et  al., 2013 ). The photorespiratory pump 
is based on the restriction of one of the key photorespira -
tory enzyme complexes, the glycine decarboxylase complex 
(GDC), to the bundle sheath cells (Rawsthorne et al., 1988a). 
Photorespiratory glycine has to move to the bundle sheath for 
decarboxylation, and CO2 is released mainly in this compart-
ment, leading to increased CO 2 concentrations and allowing 
RubisCO to work more efficiently (Bauwe, 2011; Heckmann 
et al., 2013). The photorespiratory pump can lead to a 3-fold 
enrichment of CO2 in the bundle sheath cells (Keerberg et al., 
2014). The analysis of C 3–C4 intermediate Flaveria species 
implied that the effect of the photorespiratory pump on C 4 
evolution might be quite direct and provided a mechanis -
tic explanation for how the photorespiratory pump and C 4 
photosynthesis interact (Mallmann et al., 2014). The glycine 
shuttle induces a nitrogen imbalance between mesophyll and 
bundle sheath cells, and the introduction of important com -
ponents of the C4 pathway, as well as the C4 pathway itself, are 
highly efficient ways to correct this imbalance. This implies 
that C4 evolution is a metabolic exaptation as the C 4 path-
way developed in the first place to transport nitrogen and was 
not directly related to improving photosynthetic efficiency 
(Mallmann et  al., 2014 ). Hence, photorespiration and the 
cell-specific expression of photorespiratory genes in the mes-
ophyll and bundle sheath cells of C3–C4 intermediates were of 
key importance for the evolution of C4 photosynthesis.
In the present study, we examined how the expression of 
photorespiratory genes changed after the transition to true 
C4 photosynthesis. Therefore we analyzed the expression of 
photosynthetic and photorespiratory genes in the C 4 grass 
Sorghum bicolor by RNA in situ hybridization and transcrip-
tome analysis of isolated mesophyll and bundle sheath frac -
tions. Sorghum bicolor  is a highly optimized plant species 
with regard to the C 4 pathway. Methods for the isolation of 
mesophyll and bundle sheath cells are available (Wyrich et al., 
1998) and its genome is fully sequenced (Paterson et al., 2009), 
allowing transcriptome analysis with plain high-throughput 
sequencing as well as with a serial analysis of gene expression 
(SAGE) approach since the short sequence reads could be

directly mapped to the genome or the derived transcriptome 
sequence (Bräutigam and Gowik, 2010). We determined tran-
script abundances within our mesophyll and bundle sheath 
RNA preparations by Illumina sequencing and additionally 
by SuperSage ( Matsumura et  al., 2003 ), a combination of 
SAGE with next-generation sequencing methods.
We hypothesized that the distribution of photorespiratory 
gene expression is similar to the enzyme distributions deter -
mined previously ( Ohnishi and Kanai, 1983 ; Gardeström 
et  al., 1985; Ohnishi et  al., 1985) and that it is comparable 
in specificity with the distribution of genes related to the C 4 
pathway.
Materials and methods
Plant material, RNA isolation, and cDNA synthesis
Sorghum bicolor L.  Tx430 (Pioneer Hi-Bred, Plainview, TX, USA) 
was grown on soil (Floraton 1, Floragard, Oldenburg, Germany) 
in the greenhouse of the Heinrich-Heine University (Düsseldorf, 
Germany) with supplementary light for 14 h per day (~300 μmol m−2 
s−1). For the in situ analysis, we harvested the middle thirds of the 
second leaf from 3-week-old plants and took 2 × 5 mm sections from 
it. For isolation of mesophyll and bundle sheath RNA, we harvested 
the upper two-thirds of the second leaf from 10-day-old seedlings. 
For generation of the cell-specific mRNAs, we separated the bundle 
sheath and vascular bundles enzymatically from the mesophyll and 
epidermal cells as described in Wyrich et al. (1998). We isolated 15 
independent mesophyll and 19 independent bundle sheath samples. 
Cross-contaminations of the RNA preparations were controlled 
by dot blot analysis following standard procedures. Five independ -
ent mesophyll and bundle sheath preparations were pooled for the 
SuperSage analysis. For cDNA synthesis and Illumina sequencing, 
we pooled five other preparations for each tissue. Total RNA from 
intact Sorghum leaves was isolated according to Westhoff et al. (1991). 
Poly(A)+ RNA was enriched by two consecutive rounds of oligo(dT) 
purification with the Oligotex mRNA Midi Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, 
Germany). cDNA libraries for Illumina sequencing were prepared 
with the SMARTer PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit (Clontech-Takara 
Bio Company, Otsu, Japan), with 300 ng of poly(A)+ RNA as start-
ing material. The purity and integrity of total RNA, poly(A)+ 
RNA, and cDNA were verified spectroscopically with a NanoDrop 
ND-1000, with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and by agarose gel 
electrophoresis.
SuperSage/Illumina sequencing
The SuperSage analysis was performed by GenXPro Inc. (Frankfurt, 
Germany) (Matsumura et al., 2003). The mesophyll, bundle sheath, 
and total cDNA libraries were sequenced each in one lane of an 
Illumina flow cell with an Illumina Genome Analyser II by GATC 
Biotech AG (Konstanz, Germany) following standard protocols. 
The read length was 40 bp. The cDNAs were prepared from pooled 
total RNAs.
Mapping/statistics
The SuperSage tags as well as the Illumina reads were mapped on 
the S.  bicolor transcriptome [version 1.4 (Sbicolor_79_transcript_
primaryTranscriptOnly.fa) in the case of the SuperSage tags, and 
version 3.1 (Sbicolor_313_v3.1.transcript_primaryTranscriptOnly.
fa) in the case of the Illumina reads (http://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov)]. 
The SuperSage tags were mapped with BLAST ( Altschul et  al., 
1990) by GenXPro Inc. Two mismatches were allowed and only tags 
that were found at least twice were counted. Tag counts were trans-
formed to tags per million (tpm). For the mapping of the Illumina 
reads, we used BOWTIE ( Langmead et al., 2009). The best hit for 
each Illumina read was retained, and hit counts were then trans -
formed to reads per kilobase and million (RPKM) to normalize for 
the number of reads available for each cDNA library.
Log2 ratios were calculated and differentially expressed tran -
scripts were called using the R package DEGseq (Wang et al., 2010) 
on the non-normalized read counts followed by a Bonferroni cor -
rection to account for the accumulation of alpha-type errors when 
conducting multiple pairwise comparisons.
qRT-PCR
Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) followed standard proce -
dures and was performed with an ABI7500 fast Real Time PCR 
system. The primers were designed to target photorespiratory genes 
of S. bicolor and to generate amplicons of 170 bp. The specificity of 
PCRs was verified by melting curve analysis and agarose gel electro-
phoresis. To estimate the efficiency of the PCRs, four consecutive 
5-fold dilutions of the cDNAs were tested with each primer pair. 
Only reactions with efficiencies >90% were considered for further 
analysis. As template we used total RNAs pooled from five inde -
pendent mesophyll and bundle sheath preparations each, not used 
for SuperSAGE or Illumina sequencing.
RNA in situ hybridization
The tissue was fixed for 16  h in a mixture of 3.7% formaldehyde, 
50% ethanol, and 5% acetic acid at 4 °C. Dehydration and embed -
ding was done in the Tissue Processor Leica ASP300S using the fol-
lowing program: 1 h in 50% ethanol, 1  h in 70% ethanol, 1  h in 95% 
ethanol, 3 × 1 h in 100% ethanol, 2 × 1 h in 100% xylene, 1 h in 100% 
xylene (37 °C), 2  × 10 min in histowax (62 °C), and 20  min in histo-
wax (62 °C). Subsequently the samples were embedded in paraffin 
and cut into 12 µm sections with a microtome.
Probe labeling: for the generation of hybridization probes, the 
respective cDNAs were amplified by PCR and cloned into pJET1.2/
blunt plasmid (Thermo Scientific, St. Leon-Rot, Germany). After 
linearization of the vector with appropriate restriction enzymes, T7 
RNA polymerase was used to generate both sense and antisense 
probes, which were labeled with digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled UTP 
using the DIG RNA Labeling kit (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). 
Subsequently the probes were hydrolyzed to a size of ~150–200 bases.
Pre-hybridization, hybridization, and post-hybridization steps 
were based on the protocol described by Simon (2002) . Only 
deviations from this protocol are mentioned below. First the sec -
tions were dewaxed in Roti ®-Histol for 10  min and rehydrated in a 
decreasing ethanol concentration series: 2  × 1 min in 100% ethanol, 
1 min in 95% ethanol, 1  min in 85% ethanol, 1  min in 50% ethanol, 
1 min in 30% ethanol, and 1  min in ddH 2O. Afterwards the sec -
tions were treated with 10 µg ml–1 proteinase K for 30 min at 37 °C, 
post-fixed and acetylated as described by Simon (2002), and finally 
dehydrated in a reverse order of the ethanol concentration series 
used before. For the hybridization, 150  ng of probe was used for 
each slide. The sections were incubated for 16 h at 50 °C in a humid 
chamber.
After hybridization, the sections were washed three times in wash-
ing buffer (2× SSC, 50% formamide) for 30 min at 50 °C and twice in 
NTE buffer (500 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) for 
5 min at 37 °C. After RNase A treatment, the sections were washed 
again twice in NTE at room temperature for 5  min and in washing 
buffer for 1 h at 50 °C.
For immunological detection, all steps were performed on 
a shaking platform. First the sections were washed in buffer 1 
(100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150  mM NaCl) for 5  min, before they 
were incubated in buffer 2 (buffer 1 containing 0.5% blocking 
reagent; Roche) for 40  min. Subsequently they were incubated 
in buffer 3 (buffer 1 containing 0.3% Triton X-100, 1% normal 
sheep serum, and sheep anti-DIG–alkaline phosphatase at a dilu -
tion of 1:2000) for 2  h, after which they were washed four times 
3056 | Döring et al.
in buffer 1 containing 0.3% Triton X-100 for 15  min. Then the 
sections were washed in buffer 1 for 5  min, incubated in buffer 
4 (0.1  M Tris-HCl pH 9.5, 0.1  M NaCl, and 50  mM MgCl 2) for 
5 min, and finally stained in buffer 5 [buffer 4 containing 10% 
polyvinyl alcohol, 0.16  mM nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT), and 
0.15 mM BZIP] in a humid chamber for 12–16  h. The reaction 
was stopped by washing the sections twice in distilled water, 
after which they were mounted with Entellan ® (Merck Millipore, 
Darmstadt, Germany).
Results
Mesophyll and bundle sheath RNAs
Mesophyll and bundle sheath cells of S. bicolor  for RNA 
preparations were separated by enzymatic digestion of 
leaf cell walls as described in Wyrich et al.  (1998) . It has 
to be considered that the mesophyll fraction also con -
tains epidermis cells whereas the bundle sheath fraction 
contains all vascular tissues. The cross-contamination of 
mesophyll and bundle sheath preparations was analyzed 
by dot blot analysis using a PEPC and an NADP-ME 
cDNA as hybridization probes ( Fig. 1 ). PEPC is thought 
to be mesophyll specific in Sorghum  whereas NADP-ME 
was shown to be exclusively expressed in bundle sheath 
cells ( Wyrich et  al. , 1998 ). Since no signals indicating 
cross-contamination were visible, it can be assumed that 
the RNA preparations are pure and that the cross-con -
tamination of mesophyll and bundle sheath RNAs is <5% 
(Fig. 1 ).
Transcriptome analysis via SuperSage and RNA-Seq
To create transcriptome atlases of Sorghum bundle sheath and 
mesophyll tissue, we performed plain Illumina sequencing and 
a SuperSage analysis. With the SuperSage method, we obtained 
>6.8 × 106 tags (total leaf, 1 098 800; mesophyll, 3 349 814; 
bundle sheath, 2 421 27) that could be assigned to >12 000 (12 
937) of the 34 211 predicted Sorghum genes, whereas 2327 genes 
exhibited a significantly different expression between mesophyll 
and bundle sheath cells (P<0.01) (Table 1). With plain Illumina 
sequencing we produced >36 × 106 reads (total leaf, 17 704 772; 
mesophyll, 10 420 446; bundle sheath, 8 695 328) which could be 
mapped to 23 244 Sorghum genes. With this method, we iden-
tified 1705 genes as being expressed significantly differentially 
between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells (P<0.01) (Table 1; 
Supplementary Table S1 at JXB online). With the SuperSage 
approach, we detected far fewer transcripts compared with the 
plain Illumina sequencing. This is most probably due to limita-
tions of the SuperSage method. A  transcript will not be rec -
ognized if the cleavage site of the anchoring enzyme, which is 
needed to produce the DNA fragments used as tags, is not pre-
sent in the transcript (Matsumura et al., 2003).
In total, we were able to detect 12 154 transcripts expressed 
within the Sorghum leaf with at least one read in both experi-
ments, which corresponds to 35% of the total number of 
transcripts predicted from the Sorghum genome sequence 
(Paterson et al., 2009). A total of 455 (3.7%) of them were 
more abundant in mesophyll cells and 401 (3.2%) in the bun-
dle sheath in both experiments.

rRNA were used as probes.
Expression of photorespiratory genes in Sorghum bicolor | 3057
The enzymatic separation of mesophyll and bundle 
sheath cells influences gene expression
During the separation of mesophyll and bundle sheath cells by 
enzymatic digest, the tissue is incubated for up to 2.5 h at 25 °C. 
It is known that this treatment stresses the plant cells and leads 
to the expression of stress-related genes (Sawers et  al., 2007). 
To account for this problem, we isolated RNA from complete, 
unstressed Sorghum leaves. We assumed that mesophyll and 
bundle sheath RNA accounts for a comparable fraction of 
the whole leaf RNA. Based on this premise, we identified 3697 
genes within the SuperSage experiment and 3724 genes within 
the RNA-Seq experiment that were up-regulated >3-fold appar-
ently due to the enzymatic treatment. To test this assumption, 
we analyzed the representation of Gene Ontology (GO) terms 
for the up-regulated genes. Indeed, we found an over-representa-
tion of GO terms related to stress response among these 3-fold 
up-regulated genes in the SuperSage as well as in the RNA-Seq 
experiment (Tables 2, 3). The genes found to be >3-fold up- or 
down-regulated after enzyme treatment were tagged.
The photorespiratory cycle mainly takes place in the 
bundle sheath in S. bicolor
It was assumed earlier that in C4 plants the photorespiratory path-
way is mainly located in the bundle sheath cells since in C4 plants, 
RubisCO, the entry enzyme of photorespiration, is restricted to 
this cell type (Bauwe, 2011). One exception is glycerate kinase 
(GL YK), which catalyzes the regeneration of 3-phosphoglycer-
ate (3-PG) and was found to be restricted to the mesophyll cells 
(Usuda and Edwards, 1980). The present transcriptome analy-
sis largely supports these expectations (Fig.  2; Supplementary 
Table S2), as do the in situ hybridizations (Fig. 2; Supplementary 
Fig. S1). We detected a strong signal in the bundle sheath for 
most transcripts of the core photorespiratory pathway with 
genes that show virtually no expression in the mesophyll and 
can be seen as bundle sheath specific, such as phosphoglycolate 
phosphatase (PGLP), glycolate oxidase (GOX), serine hydroxy-
methyl transferase (SHM), and the H, P, and T subunit of the 
GDC (Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. S1). However, there are also 
genes such as glycine 2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase (GGT) 
and the GDC L subunit that, although preferentially expressed 
in the bundle sheath, still seem to be expressed to a certain 
extent in the mesophyll (Fig. 2; Supplementary Fig. S1). Taken 
together, this implies that all genes of the core photorespiratory 
pathway are at least preferentially if not specifically expressed 
in the bundle sheath, except for GL YK that is expressed to a 
much higher level in the mesophyll than in the bundle sheath 
(Fig. 2; Supplementary Table S2). We did not obtain any in situ 
hybridization signal for GL YK. This may be caused by the low 
absolute expression of the gene observed even in the mesophyll 
(Supplementary Table S2).
The transcriptome analysis reveals detailed insight into 
the C4 pathway of S. bicolor
Sorghum bicolor  belongs to the NADP-ME type of C 4 
plants. The genes encoding PEPC, malate dehydrogenase 
(MDH), or PPDK are expected to be expressed specifically 
or at least strongly preferentially in the mesophyll in these 
plants, whereas the genes encoding NADP-ME or RubisCO 
are bundle sheath specific. The results of our transcrip -
tome analyses are essentially in line with these expecta -
tions ( Fig.  3; Supplementary Table S3 ). Although PEPC

was found to be expressed preferentially in the mesophyll, 
as expected, the absolute transcript levels as estimated by 
the Illumina sequencing appear to be quite low compared 
with NADP-ME or PPDK. In contrast, PEPC transcript 
levels turned out to be quite high when determined by the 
SuperSage method ( Supplementary Table S3 ). If and how 
we selected against detecting high levels of the PEPC dur -
ing the Illumina analysis is unclear. We detected virtually 
no expression of bundle sheath genes such as NADP-ME 
or RubisCO in the mesophyll, indicating that our mesophyll 
RNA preparations were not cross-contaminated with bundle 
sheath RNA (Supplementary Tables S2, S3). The fact that we 
detected some expression of typical mesophyll genes such as 
PEPC in the bundle sheath indicates some contamination of 
our bundle sheath RNA preparation with mesophyll RNA in 
the range of ~5% (Supplementary Table S3).
Recent results indicate that the classification of the differ -
ent types of the C 4 pathway is not as clear-cut as previously

thought ( Furbank, 2011 ; Pick et  al., 2011 ; Y . Wang et  al., 
2014). Maize, which was assumed to be an archetypal NADP-
ME-type C4 plant, uses in parallel the PEP-CK type pathway 
to a considerable extent (Wingler et al., 1999; Pick et al., 2011). 
Interestingly this does not apply for Sorghum, although maize 
and Sorghum possess a common C 4 origin. We did not find 
a highly expressed PEP-CK gene in bundle sheath cells and 
no abundantly expressed NAD-ME genes could be detected 
(Supplementary Table S3). It follows that Sorghum instead of 
maize should be considered as the NADP-ME C 4 archetype. 
It was shown earlier that, in contrast to the common text -
book models of this pathway, some NADP-ME species use 
alanine and aspartate as transport metabolites in parallel to 
malate and pyruvate (Meister et al., 1996; Gowik et al., 2011). 
We were interested in whether the same is true for Sorghum, 
but the results are inconclusive. While we could identify a 
highly expressed aspartate aminotransferase (AspAT) gene 
in mesophyll as well as in bundle sheath cells, we have not 
found an alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT) that is highly 
expressed in both cell types. The most highly abundant 
AlaAT transcript, which belongs to the most abundant tran-
scripts identified in this study, is clearly mesophyll specific. 
The function of this highly abundant AlaAT in the mesophyll 
remains unknown. We found another AlaAT gene which 
was significantly more highly expressed in the bundle sheath 
compared with the mesophyll (Supplementary Table S3) but, 
since its overall abundance is much lower, it is unclear if the 
overall AlaAT transcript abundance in the bundle sheath

allows the considerable usage of alanine and aspartate as 
transport metabolites. The up-regulated AspAT, on the other 
hand, is predicted to be localized in the chloroplast (TargetP 
score: 0.968). This in line with other NADP-ME species that 
synthesize and decarboxylate aspartate in the chloroplasts 
of mesophyll and bundle sheath cells ( Meister et  al., 1996 ; 
Gowik et al., 2011).
Transcripts related to most of the known transporters thought 
to be directly involved in the NADP-ME C4 pathway, such as the 
triosephosphate phosphate translocator (TPT), the PEP phos-
phate translocator (PPT), the dicarboxylate transporter (DIT/
DCT/OMT), or the inner chloroplast envelope transporter MEP 
(Weber and von Caemmerer, 2010) could be identified, and most 
of them showed high abundance in agreement with their prob-
able role in the C4 pathway (Fig. 3; Supplementary Table S3). 
However, it has to be considered that they did not always show 
the expected distribution in the two cell types (e.g. the PPT 
was expected to be mesophyll specific but we also found high 
amounts of PPT transcripts in the bundle sheath). We could not 
detect high expression for the BASS2 and the NHD transporter 
that were shown to catalyze pyruvate transport across the chlo-
roplast membrane in the C4 Flaveria species (Furumoto et al., 
2011). This is in line with earlier results indicating that Sorghum 
uses a proton-dependent pyruvate transporter (Aoki et al., 1992) 
instead of BASS, which was shown to be a pyruvate–sodium 
symporter (Furumoto et al., 2011).
While most of the core C4 genes are expressed either meso-
phyll or bundle sheath specifically, as expected, we found that 
PPDK transcripts are not only highly abundant in the meso-
phyll, but were also present in respectable amounts in the bun-
dle sheath, with a mesophyll to bundle sheath ratio of only ~1 
to 2 (Fig. 3). Along with that, we also found that transcripts 
related to the PPDK reaction such as pyrophosphatases, 
AMP kinase, or the PPT exhibit high levels in the bundle 
sheath cells and are partly even preferentially expressed in the 
bundle sheath (Supplementary Table S3).
To verify the tissue distribution of selected transcripts, we 
performed in situ  hybridizations for typical C 4 genes such 
as PEPC, NADP-ME, PPDK, and RBCS (RubisCO small 
subunit). The obtained results largely support the outcome 
of the transcriptome analysis using SuperSage or RNA-Seq 
(compare Fig.  3A and B). In situ  hybridization confirmed 
bundle sheath-specific expression for RBCS and NADP-ME, 
mesophyll-specific expression for the PEPC gene, and the 
preferential expression in the mesophyll cells of PPDK, with 
high PPDK transcript levels also in the bundle sheath.
Expression patterns of genes associated with 
photorespiration are variable
During photorespiration not only CO 2, but also nitrogen 
is released in the mitochondria in the form of NH 3 that 
becomes reassimilated in the chloroplasts. In contrast to the 
core photorespiratory pathway, the genes for nitrogen assimi-
lation and the dedicated transporters do not show a tissue-
specific expression pattern. Glutamine synthetase as well as 
glutamate synthase genes are expressed in mesophyll and 
bundle sheath cells, but glutamine synthetase is more highly 
expressed in the bundle sheath, and a ferredoxin-dependent 
glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase (Fd-GOGAT) 
shows higher transcript abundance in the mesophyll ( Fig. 2; 
Supplementary Table D2).
Only a few transporters involved in the intracellular trans-
port of photorespiratory metabolites are known to date. We 
could identify two transcripts corresponding to the plastid 
glycolate glycerate transporter (Pick et al., 2013). Whereas one 
of the genes appears not to be expressed at all in the Sorghum 
leaf, the other one exhibits high amounts of transcripts in both 
cell types, but the expression in the bundle sheath is higher 
than in the mesophyll (Fig. 2; Supplementary Table S2). The 
mitochondrial transporter BOU, known to be needed for 
functional photorespiration in Arabidopsis thaliana (Eisenhut 
et al., 2013), appears to be expressed only at a low level in the 
leaves of the C 4 plant Sorghum and does not show a strong 
tissue preference (Supplementary Table S2). Sorghum contains 
five genes encoding dicarboxylate transporters (DITs); four of 
these transporters are classified as DIT2 and one is classified 
as a DIT1 gene. The DIT1 gene is expressed to moderate levels 
and clearly is expressed preferentially in the mesophyll. One 
of the DIT2 genes is highly expressed in the bundle sheath 
(Fig.  2; Supplementary Table S2). The two transporters are 
thought to interact in the glutamate–oxoglutarate exchange 
across the chloroplast membrane during NH 3 reassimilation 
(Renne et al., 2003; Bauwe et al., 2010). Additionally the DIT 
proteins might be involved in the C 4 cycle of NADP-ME C 4 
species and facilitate the exchange of malate and/or aspar -
tate across the chloroplast membrane ( Gowik et  al., 2011 ; 
Kinoshita et al., 2011), which may explain the highly tissue-
preferential expression of these genes in Sorghum.
Discussion
C4 photosynthesis mainly evolved to enhance photosynthetic 
efficiency by avoiding photorespiration. It is widely accepted 
that an important initial step towards the evolution of C4 was the 
establishment of a photorespiratory CO2 pump (Bauwe, 2011; 
Sage et al., 2012). This was achieved by restricting the activity 
of a central photorespiratory protein complex, the GDC, to the 
bundle sheath cells, allowing the release of photorespiratory 
CO2 exclusively in this cell type (Hylton et al., 1988; Rawsthorne 
et al., 1988b). Finally that was realized by restricting the expres-
sion of either single GDC subunit genes or all GDC and SHM 
genes to the bundle sheath (Morgan et al., 1993). Nevertheless, 
photorespiration is still essential in C4 plants (Zelitch et al., 2008) 
and we were interested in the tissue-specific expression of pho-
torespiratory genes in the mesophyll and bundle sheath cells of a 
widely optimized C4 species. Therefore we analyzed gene expres-
sion in leaves of S. bicolor using RNA-Seq on isolated mesophyll 
and bundle sheath transcripts and RNA in situ hybridization.
Photorespiration is largely confined to the bundle 
sheath cells in Sorghum
In C4 plants, photorespiration is reduced to low levels com -
pared with C3 plants as a result of concentrating CO2 around 
RubisCO ( Hatch, 1987 ). Using RNA-Seq and SuperSage, 
Expression of photorespiratory genes in Sorghum bicolor | 3061
we were able to detect the transcripts of all core photores -
piratory genes as well as of the genes encoding transporters 
known to be involved in photorespiration. The vast major -
ity of the core photorespiratory genes are expressed prefer -
entially in the bundle sheath. The only noticeable exceptions 
are GL YK, which is expressed preferentially in the mesophyll, 
and the two genes encoding the L subunit of the GDC com -
plex (GDCL), which are nearly equally expressed in both cell 
types. This largely reflects earlier results from the analysis of 
mesophyll and bundle sheath transcriptomes and proteomes 
of the C 4 grass maize ( Li et al., 2010; Majeran et al., 2010; 
Chang et  al., 2012 ) and studies on the enzyme activities in 
different C4 species (Usuda and Edwards, 1980; Ohnishi and 
Kanai, 1983; Ohnishi et al., 1985). Since in C4 plants RubisCO 
is missing from the mesophyll cells, no 2-PG can be produced 
there and 2-PG detoxification in this cell type is no longer 
necessary. Consequently, the expression of photorespiratory 
genes was switched off in the mesophyll during C4 evolution. 
The photorespiratory enzymes belong to the most highly 
abundant proteins in the leaves of C 3 species ( Osborne and 
Freckleton, 2009; Bauwe, 2011). Accordingly, the decrease in 
these proteins adds to the reduction of RubisCO in C4 plants 
and contributes to the better nitrogen use efficiency found for 
C4 species (Oaks, 1994; Osborne and Freckleton, 2009).
 GDCL is not only part of the GDC but is also connected 
to other multienzyme complexes such as the pyruvate dehy -
drogenase complex, the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase com -
plex, and the branched-chained 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase 
that are not involved in photorespiration and have impor -
tant functions in general cell metabolism (Millar et al., 1999; 
Marrott et al., 2014). This explains why the genes encoding 
GDCL have to stay active in the mesophyll of C 4 plants. An 
explanation for the preferential expression of GL YK in the 
mesophyll is less obvious. In advanced C 4 species using the 
NADP-ME pathway, such as maize or Sorghum, the activ -
ity of photosystem II is greatly reduced in the bundle sheath 
(Woo et  al., 1970 ; Oswald et  al., 1990 ). This requires the 
reductive phase of the Calvin–Benson cycle to take place in 
the mesophyll cells, due to a lack of reducing equivalents in 
the bundle sheath, and is achieved by a phosphoglycerate–tri-
ose phosphate shuttle ( Weber and von Caemmerer, 2010). It 
appears to be more efficient to transfer the photorespiratory 
glycerate directly to the mesophyll chloroplasts to regenerate 
3-PG instead of importing it into the bundle sheath chloro -
plast for regeneration.
The genes involved in photorespiratory ammonia refixa -
tion, glutamine synthetase and glutamate synthase, show 
different expression patterns in mesophyll and bundle sheath 
cells. While two glutamine synthetase genes are expressed in 
both cell types with a bundle sheath preference, Fd-GOGAT 
is preferentially expressed in the mesophyll. This makes sense 
in the light of lacking reducing equivalents in the bundle 
sheath and one can assume that the released ammonia is fixed 
by glutamine synthetase and the resulting glutamine is par -
tially transferred to the mesophyll to generate glutamate.
The plastidic glycolate glycerate transporter PLGG1 (Pick 
et  al., 2013 ) is expressed in both cell types. This might be 
due to the fact that glycolate has to be exported from bundle 
sheath chloroplasts and glycerate must be imported into the 
chloroplasts in the mesophyll. It is known that the mito -
chondrial transporter BOU is essential for photorespiration 
in A.  thaliana ( Eisenhut et  al., 2013 ). Like PLGG, BOU is 
expressed in both cell types, but the overall transcript abun -
dance is much lower. Since the specific substrate for the BOU 
transporter is not known (Eisenhut et al., 2013), one can only 
speculate about possible functions beside photorespiration.
Specificity of photorespiratory genes is as variable as 
that of C4 genes
With the transcriptome analysis, we confirmed that S. bicolor 
belongs to the NADP-ME type of C 4 plants since all par -
ticipating C 4 genes ( Wang et  al., 2009 ) are expressed in a 
tissue-preferential manner as expected for the NADP-ME 
archetype. Recent studies in maize revealed that not only the 
NADP-ME pathway is operating, but a respectable level of 
PEP-CK activity, up to 25% of the NADP-ME activity, was 
also found ( Pick et  al., 2011 ). In the leaf transcriptome of 
S. bicolor we could find neither any highly expressed PEP-CK 
gene nor any significantly expressed NAD-ME gene in the 
bundle sheath. Taken together, these results indicate that 
Sorghum relies solely on the NADP-ME pathway.
As expected, we found PPDK to be one of the most highly 
expressed genes in the Sorghum leaf. Surprisingly, the tran -
scriptome analysis indicated that PPDK transcripts are not 
restricted to the mesophyll but are also found in high amounts 
in the bundle sheath, with a mesophyll to bundle sheath 
ratio of only ~1 to 2 ( Fig. 3). We confirmed that the analy -
sis detects only the gene encoding the chloroplast-targeted 
PPDK isoform and indeed the gene encoding the cytosolic 
isoform showed quite low expression in Sorghum leaves. Also 
the RNA in situ analysis indicates high amounts of PPDK 
transcripts in the bundle sheath cells ( Fig.  3B). Since this 
analysis is strictly independent of the transcriptome analy -
sis, it must be considered that Sorghum contains considerable 
amounts of PPDK in its bundle sheath cells. This is in con -
trast to the analysis of mesophyll and bundle sheath cells of 
maize or S. viridis where PPDK transcripts were found to be 
five and 20 times more abundant in the mesophyll than in the 
bundle sheath, respectively ( Chang et al., 2012; John et al., 
2014). Very similar patterns were also found for the tran -
scripts of genes that functionally interact with PPDK such 
as the PPDK regulatory proteins, plastid-localized pyroph -
osphatases, an AMP kinase, and the plastid PEP translocator 
PPT (Fig.  3; Supplementary Table S3). For all these genes, 
we found considerable amounts of transcripts in the bun -
dle sheath preparations that were often even higher than in 
the mesophyll. The most parsimonious explanation is that 
Sorghum is capable of regenerating substantial amounts of 
PEP in the bundle sheath cells. The existence of plants using 
extensively the PEP-CK type of the C 4 pathway shows that 
PEP can serve as a transport metabolite in the C 4 cycle. Due 
to up-regulation of photosystem I and cyclic electron trans -
port in the bundle sheath chloroplasts (Supplementary Table 
S1; Kubicki et al., 1994, 1996), Sorghum potentially produces 
high amounts of ATP in this compartment that can be used 
3062 | Döring et al.
for PEP regeneration. By regenerating PEP in the bundle 
sheath chloroplasts, the number of transport processes would 
be reduced since PEP can be exported by PPT and diffuse 
into the mesophyll where it could be carboxylated by PEPC 
in the cytosol.
All in all, it appears that the degree of cell specificity is 
quite comparable for photorespiratory and C 4 cycle genes. 
While most of the genes encoding core pathway enzymes are 
expressed in a highly cell type-specific manner, exceptions are 
the PPDK in the case of the C 4 cycle and GDCL in the case 
of photorespiration. This is notable since tissue specificity 
for C4 enzymes such as PEPC or NADP-ME is necessary to 
avoid futile cycles and ensure the efficiency of the pathway, 
whereas tissue-specific expression of most photorespiratory 
genes has to be seen as optimization that saves nitrogen. The 
expression of auxiliary genes of both pathways was found to 
be not very tissue specific. This might be due to additional 
roles of the encoded protein in other important pathways as 
can be envisaged for the genes involved in primary nitrogen 
and amino acid metabolism.
Evolutionary aspects of restricting photorespiration to 
the bundle sheath
As discussed above, photorespiration was important for 
the evolution of C 4 photosynthesis in different ways. The 
avoidance of photorespiration was one of the driving forces 
towards C4 photosynthesis, and the establishment of a pho -
torespiratory pump was an important intermediate step 
during C 4 evolution ( Bauwe, 2011 ; Sage et al. , 2012 ). The 
reduction and exclusion of the majority of photorespiratory 
reactions from the mesophyll represents an optimization 
and enhances the nitrogen use efficiency. This optimiza -
tion could only happen after the implementation of a fully 
functional C4 pathway and the complete down-regulation of 
RubisCO in the mesophyll since the oxygenase reaction of 
RubisCO would be fatal without PGLP and GOX activity 
present in the same compartment. This has a further impli -
cation for C4 evolution: once PGLP and GOX are switched 
off in the mesophyll, the reintroduction of RubisCO into 
this compartment would be detrimental. Once these pho -
torespiratory reactions are gone from the mesophyll due 
to optimization, a reversal from C 4 to C 3 photosynthesis 
becomes impossible.
