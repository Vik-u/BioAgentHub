Abstract: Transcriptomes from stem-inoculated Scots pine saplings were analyzed to identify unique
and enriched H. annosum transcripts in the early stages of infection. Comparing different time points
since inoculation identiﬁed 131 differentially expressed H. annosum genes with p-values of ≤0.01.
Our research supports the results of previous studies on the Norway spruce–Heterobasidion annosum
s.l. pathosystem, indicating the role of carbohydrate and lignin degradation genes in pathogenesis
at different time points post-inoculation and the role of lipid metabolism genes (including but not
limited to the delta-12 fatty acid desaturase gene previously reported to be an important factor). The
results of this study indicate that the malic enzyme could be a potential gene of interest in the context
of H. annosum virulence. During this study, difﬁculties related to incomplete reference material of the
host plant species and a low proportion of H. annosum transcripts in the RNA pool were encountered.
In addition, H. annosum transcripts are currently not well annotated. Improvements in sequencing
technologies (including sequencing depth) or bioinformatics focusing on small subpopulations of
RNA would be welcome.

1. Introduction
Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) is the most widely distributed pine species and is found
throughout Eurasia [1]. It is a species of major economic importance, widely used in timber,
pulp, and paper production [2]. It is also a keystone species providing stability for large
ecosystems [3,4] and has been a dominant species for millennia [5].
One of the main causes of pine mortality, excluding bark beetles (genera Ips and
Tomicus [6,7]), are Heterobasidion complex fungi, in particular, the basidiomycete Heteroba-
sidion annosum (Fr.) Bref., which causes root rot [ 8]. In the European forest sector, the
Heterobasidion complex causes combined economic losses of hundreds of millions of euros
annually [9]. While the exact proportion of the losses speciﬁcally related to Scots pine is
not known, given the widespread distribution of Scots pine in European forests and the
high economic value of Scots pine, the economic impact of this pathosystem on Scots pine
is signiﬁcant.
Currently, mitigation ofHeterobasidion root rot includes forest management activities
(monitoring, creation of sustainable forests, sanitary felling, etc.) [ 10–13]. One of the
strategies for the protection of renewed pine stands is the use of biological control agents
based on the fungus Phlebiopsis gigantea (Fr.) Jülich [ 14–16]. Breeding for resistance or
tolerance is promising, as the genetic components for H. annosum resistance have been
determined [17], Scots pine clones with varying resistance against H. annosum have been
described [18], and the heritability and genetic gain values for breeding for resistance
against root rot have been calculated [19].
To increase the efﬁciency of breeding programs, genetic mechanisms and candidate
genes for resistance need to be identiﬁed; thus, studies on gene expression changes in
the host in response to inoculation and related genetic testing have been performed for

Scots pine reacting to H. annosum, and also for related pathosystems [ 20–24]. Genetic
virulence factors of H. annosum have also been studied [25,26]. A study combining genomic
and transcriptome approaches identiﬁed genes linked with secreted proteins as potential
virulence factors (besides genes involved in oxidation–reduction processes and genes
encoding domains relevant to transcription factors) [ 27]. In the same study, secretome
annotation and analysis in the pathogen–host interactions database [28] showed that the
most virulent Heterobasidion parviporum isolate was found to contain many carbohydrate-
active enzyme genes for cell wall degradation and an increased amount of secreted proteins
for lignin degradation. Proteins of the reactive oxygen species-scavenging system and
proteases were identiﬁed as an important part of the secretome. This study also identiﬁed
cytochrome P450 proteins as signiﬁcant for pathogenesis, which could be explained by the
involvement of cytochrome P450 gene family members in the detoxiﬁcation of substances
from the environment and the synthesis of fungal toxins [ 29]. However, the study by
Zeng et al. [27] did not identify a speciﬁc gene as the sole determinant for variations in
virulence between different H. parviporum isolates.
Recently, dual transcriptome studies have provided information on host and pathogen
transcriptomes simultaneously [30–33]. However, not all of these studies focused on the
host–pathogen interactions [31]. Dual transcriptome studies are also possible only if a high
number of reads can be obtained from samples to provide a sufﬁcient number of pathogen
transcriptome reads, as the proportion of transcripts from the pathogen can be below
1% [32]. No dual transcriptome studies on the H. annosum–P . sylvestrispathosystem have
been published and, to the best of our knowledge, there are no investigations providing
data on the H. annosum (sensu stricto) transcriptome during infection of Scots pine. However,
in a study by Lunden et al. (2015) about the inoculation of Norway spruce with H. annosum
s.s., delta-12 fatty acid desaturase and clavaminate synthase were indicated as potential
virulence factors [33]. Polysaccharide-degrading enzymes and lignin-degrading enzymes
have long been regarded as important for pathogenesis [ 34]. Expression of these genes
was also detected in a dual transcriptome experiment by Kovalchuk et al. (2019) [ 30].
The same study also mentioned that seven Heterobasidion genes classiﬁed as lipases were
expressed, but no further details were provided in that study. The expression of lipid
metabolism genes (encoding lipases and the malic enzyme) was detected in Fusarium
circinatum Nirenberg & O’Donnell while infecting Pinus species [32]. In addition to the
expression of polysaccharide- and lignin-degrading enzyme genes, the accumulation of
toxins and oxalate has been reported in host tissues colonized by Heterobasidion [34].
Previous research has shown that analysis of fungal transcriptomes enables the un-
derstanding of adaptations by pathogens to different host species [ 32]. Therefore, the
accumulation of in planta gene expression data for H. annosum can enable the analysis of
the variation in defense strategies within the host species by inoculation experiments with
genetically characterized fungal isolates. This could be used as a basis for the identiﬁcation
of molecular markers for resistance-oriented forest tree breeding. In addition, a comparison
of fungal gene expression between isolates could provide insights into differences in ag-
gressiveness or virulence, providing a better understanding of the role of genetic variation
of pathogens in the development of plant diseases. This investigation provides an initial
assessment of time post-inoculation-dependent differentially expressed pathogen genes
from one to four weeks post-inoculation. This assessment is based on mapping a large
number of reads to the H. annosum transcriptome (>11 million). This provides information
about genes and pathways important in early pathogenesis and demonstrates the feasibility
of the utilized sequencing technology.

1 First symbol in the name represents weeks after inoculation.
From material taken one week post-inoculation, 3.84 million H. annosum reads were
obtained. Material taken at two to four weeks post-inoculation produced, respectively, 2.54,
3.05, and 1.82 million H. annosum reads. This shows that a sufﬁcient number of reads for
statistical analysis was obtained, regardless of the low RIN values of the samples. Mapping
against the transcriptome of P . sylvestrisproduced hits for, on average, 42.51% of the reads,
depending on the library.
The high proportion of reads not mapping onto P . sylvestriscan be explained by the
limited nature of the reference transcriptome. A Scots pine reference genome is currently
not available, and this inﬂuences the annotation and quality control of any Scots pine
transcriptome generated before the availability of a high-quality reference genome.
2.2. Most Transcribed Genes at Each Time Point
Based on the number of reads mapping onto the H. annosum reference transcripts, we
determined the 100 most transcribed genes at each time point (Supplementary File S1).
The frequency of level 7 biological process gene ontology (GO) terms was similar
between all time points. The unique GO terms for each time point are summarized in

Fifty of the most highly expressed genes were shared between all time points, and
each time point had ﬁfty unique genes.
2.3. Differential Gene Expression
All time points were compared against all other time points, resulting in six statistical
comparisons for differential gene expression (DGE). The main focus of this study was the
analysis of early-stage infection transcripts; therefore, for visualizations, the transcriptome
one week after inoculation was compared with the other time points (Figure 1). A Venn di-
agram of the comparison between all time points is provided in Supplementary Figure S1.

RT-qPCR validation was not performed on the differentially expressed H. annosum
genes, as recent research [35,36] indicates that RNA-seq and RT-qPCR results are concordant
when gene expression fold changes exceed 2. In this study, the differentially expressed
genes listed in Tables 3–5 all had fold changes between 8 and 182.

3. Discussion
Differences between the libraries in the proportion of H. annosum reads might indicate
biologically relevant information, such as the proportion of the living pathogen in the tissue
from which RNA was extracted, and other explanations like sampling effects, host genotype
effects, unequal rRNA depletion or induced host rRNA production at some time points
could inﬂuence the results. This could also be an indication of a varying positive effect
from the inoculum plug still providing resources to the pathogen, but this hypothesis was
not explicitly analyzed in this study. If one outlier (the library with the largest difference
from the average percentage of H. annosum reads per group) was removed per time point,
a strong correlation (R 2 = 0.8116) between a longer time since inoculation and a lower
proportion of H. annosum reads was observed. Yet, given the many factors inﬂuencing the
proportion of H. annosum reads, we refrained from conclusions.
Most of the differentially expressed genes lacked detailed annotations; however, some
of the genes showing the highest upregulation during infection might have a role in dis-
turbing host cell integrity (e.g., the carotenoid ester lipase precursor, which is secreted
and can cross the cell wall [37], and erylysin B [38]), can affect lipid metabolism (e.g., the
carotenoid ester lipase precursor, fatty acid desaturase domain-containing protein, delta-12
fatty acid desaturase [33], elongase of fatty acids ELO, and malic enzyme [ 39]), terpene
metabolism (terpenoid cyclases/protein prenyltransferase alpha-alpha toroid), or are in-
volved in oxidation–reduction processes (aldo/keto reductase [40]), cellular growth (GPI
mannosyltransferase 3 [41]), cell development and metabolism control (methionine adeno-
syltransferase (synonym for S-adenosylmethionine synthetase) [42]), and stress tolerance
(heat shock protein 70). The increased expression of delta-12 fatty acid desaturases and
related protein genes was especially pronounced comparing 1 WPI with 4 WPI. This could
be related to lignin degradation [ 43], especially in the context of elevated transcription
of polysaccharide lyase [44]. The initial stage of infection requires the fungal hyphae to
penetrate host cell walls to colonize the tissue. As the structural integrity of conifer tissue is
mainly ensured by cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin, polysaccharide-degrading enzymes
are needed to penetrate the tissue and access nutrition sources away from potential competi-
tors on the tissue surface. Several microorganisms on soil and tissue surfaces can negatively
affect the growth of H. annosum; therefore, the ability to quickly penetrate cell walls and
colonize tissues is important for the survival of the fungus and successful infection of the
host [34].
At one week post-inoculation, a terpenoid cyclase gene was more highly expressed
than at two or three weeks post-inoculation. However, as terpenoids represent the most
diverse and abundant class of natural products and have high functional diversity [45,46],
any suggestions about the possible role in the infection process would be highly speculative.
Genes downregulated during early-stage infection have roles in transcription and
translation (transcription regulator, 40S ribosomal protein S26, and RS27A protein), polyamine
regulation (ornithine decarboxylase antizyme domain-containing protein [ 47]), protein
folding as chaperones (the groes-like protein and HSP20-like chaperone), and cell devel-
opment/signaling (cell division control/GTP-binding protein). Decreased activity of the
negative regulator of differentiation 1 gene one week after inoculation could result in the
positive regulation of differentiation.
Clearly, improved characterization of the proteins encoded by the differentially ex-
pressed genes is needed to obtain a better understanding of the molecular processes affect-
ing H. annosum’s pathogenicity. However, the results obtained about the annotated genes
suggest that delta-12 fatty acid desaturases could be a virulence factor. Delta-12 fatty acid
desaturase gene expression in theH. annosum–Norway spruce pathosystem was detected by
Lundén et al. (2015) [33]. These authors suggest a central role of this enzyme in sustaining
fungal growth. Considering the extremely small amount of H. annosum transcripts in the
work of Lund én et al. and the small proportion of H. annosum reads in our work, the
identiﬁcation of the delta-12 fatty acid desaturase gene as important for the pathogen indi-
cates that this gene plays an important role during infection. An increase in the expression

of other transcripts inﬂuencing lipid metabolism was also observed (the malic enzyme,
elongase of fatty acids, and an unspeciﬁed type of fatty acid desaturase domain-containing
protein). The gene for the malic enzyme was the only differentially upregulated gene
comparing the one-week post-inoculation time point against all other time points. This
concurs with ﬁndings showing the role of fungal lipids and lipid biosynthesis proteins
in plant–pathogen interactions as potential virulence factors [48,49]. The malic enzyme is
potentially highly interesting in this context. As reviewed by Voreapreeda et al. (2013) [50],
there are different types of malic enzymes (EC 1.1.1.38–EC 1.1.1.40), but the malic enzyme
gene identiﬁed in our study (sequence ID: CCPC2187.b1 [ 51]) was not categorized into
a speciﬁc group. However, the activity of the malic enzyme can drastically change the
lipid content of oleaginous fungi [52]. Furthermore, a study investigating the H. annosum
transcriptome during saprotrophic growth on Scots pine bark, sapwood, and heartwood
detected the downregulation of the malic enzyme during growth on bark and heartwood
chips [53]. This may suggest that malic enzyme activity is needed speciﬁcally when invad-
ing a living host; however, further research is needed, as in the previous study, the time
post-treatment was 3 months, in contrast with one week in our study.
The observed downregulation of glycoside and glycosyl hydrolase genes at 1 WPI
compared with 4 WPI might seem counterintuitive, as enzymes of these groups and
carbohydrate-active enzymes, in general, have been recognized as one of the main compo-
nents facilitating fungal invasion [54,55]. Glycoside and glycosyl hydrolases have a role in
the degradation of plant cell wall components; thus, it could be expected to see increased
activity of these genes at earlier stages of infection. However, this class of proteins is vast
and complex [ 56], and, therefore, these could be family members with other functions.
Members of these groups could be involved in fungal cell wall remodeling, putting it in
context with increased fungal growth at later stages of infection.
The upregulation of speciﬁc transcription factors sensitive to fungal or plant hormones
was not observed, except for one transcription regulator at 1 WPI with limited information
about this protein. In general, the biological functions of most highly expressed genes
speciﬁc to 1 WPI indicate attempts to mitigate oxidative stress and other elements involved
in plant defenses. The response to oxidative stress could be linked to protection from
reactive oxygen species involved in host defense responses [ 57]. Alternatively, it could
also be associated with the pathogen’s own development-related cell signaling [ 58] or
both. Other biological processes of 1WPI-speciﬁc transcripts are related to metabolism,
gene expression, and the response to heat, osmotic, and oxidative stress. In addition, the
glyoxylate cycle can also facilitate a reduction in oxidative stress [ 59]. In a broad sense,
these transcriptome changes suggest that the pathogen is employing protective measures
against plant defenses.
Considering the high proportion of differentially expressed genes lacking detailed
annotations, there are still many unknown factors and genes that are involved in the
pathogenicity mechanism. More research on the molecular biology of H. annosum is needed
to gain a better understanding of virulence factors. Further research using genetically
identical host plants to obtain a high-quality dual transcriptome of H. annosum–P . sylvestris
interactions at different time points post-inoculation can provide additional information
about the interactions between the pathogen and host during the infection process.
4. Materials and Methods
One-year-old Scots pine saplings were inoculated with a Latvian isolate (ID HA2)
of H. annosum s.s . The saplings were obtained from the Latvian State Forests seedling
nursery in Kalsnava, Latvia, and were grown from mixed-origin improved seed material.
For inoculation, a wooden plug grown with the H. annosum isolate was placed on an area of
the stem with the bark surface removed. Samples for RNA extraction were collected at one,
two, three, and four weeks post-inoculation and stored at −80 ◦C until RNA extraction.
Four biological replicate samples were collected for each time point. RNA extraction
was performed following a CTAB-based protocol [ 60]. The sampling site included the
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2024, 25, 11375 9 of 13
inoculation site. These time points were chosen, ﬁrstly, to allow time for the pathogen to
grow into the host tissue and form biomass to increase the number of obtainable reads and,
secondly, to allow partial comparison with previous studies (Lundén et al., 2015 [33] and
Zamora-Ballesteros et al., 2021 [32]), which used 5 and 4 days post-inoculation as their only
time points, respectively. In the context of infection progression, in the relatedPicea abies (L.)
H. Karst.–H. parviporum Niemelä & Korhonen pathosystem, germ tubes form in roots within
24 h after spore adhesion, colonization of cortical tissue happens 24–48 post-inoculation,
and the endodermis is reached at 72 h [61]. By 12 to 15 days post-inoculation, stelar cells
have deteriorated, but plant responses involving papillae formation and ligniﬁcation in the
cortical and endodermis tissue in the roots can be observed [61]. Thus, the selected time
points represent early infection and later stages.
RNA extraction was followed by quality control of the RNA samples using the
Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and RNA 6000 nano kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA, USA, Cat.
No. 5067–1511) for RNA integrity determination and quantitation using the Qubit spec-
troﬂuorometer and Qubit RNA BR Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, MA, USA,
Cat. No. Q10210). The obtained material was quite degraded. The RIN values ranged from
1.9 to 4.7 (average: 2.6), and three samples did not produce a RIN value but were included
as good results and were obtained using qPCR to detect the presence of H. annosum RNA
in the total RNA samples. Considering that short-read (100 bp) sequencing was used,
thus reducing the inﬂuence of degraded RNA, sequencing libraries were prepared with all
samples. The RNA quality control data are provided in Supplementary Table S1.
To conﬁrm the presence of H. annosum RNA in the extracted RNA samples, one-step
RT-qPCR with H. annosum-speciﬁc primers targeting the laccase gene was performed. The
GoTaq® 1-Step RT-qPCR system (Promega, Madison, WI, USA, Cat. No. A6021) was
used with the forward primer 5′-CCAGAAAGTAGACAATTATTGGATTCG-3′and reverse
primer 5′-GAGTTGCGGCCATTATCGA-3′ [62]. The reaction mixture per sample was
10 µL of GoTaq qPCR Master Mix (2X); 0.4 µL of GoScript RT Mix for 1-Step RT-qPCR
(50X); 0.33 µL of CXR reference dye; a ﬁnal concentration of each primer of 200 nM; and
nuclease-free water to a volume of 20 µL. The thermal cycling proﬁle was as follows: 37 ◦C
for 15 min and 95 ◦C for 10 min, followed by 40 cycles at 95 ◦C for 10 s, 60 ◦C for 30 s, 72 ◦C
for 30 s, followed by a melting curve stage, during which the temperature was increased
from 60 ◦C to 95 ◦C in 0.3 ◦C intervals. One-step RT-qPCR was performed in an Applied
Biosystems StepOnePlus qPCR machine. To avoid the inﬂuence of primer dimers on the
results, the melting curve peak height for the speciﬁc qPCR product was used instead of
the Ct value. This approach was possible because none of the reactions reached the plateau
phase. The peak height of the speciﬁc product was divided by the RNA concentration to
obtain a ratio characterizing the proportion of H. annosum RNA in the RNA sample.
Transcriptome sequencing libraries were created using the MGIEasy RNA Directional
Library Prep Set (MGI Tech Co., Shenzhen, China, Cat. No. 1000006385) following the
manufacturer’s protocol. An amount of 500 ng of total RNA was used for each library.
Ribosomal RNA was depleted using the Qiagen QIAseq FastSelect–rRNA Plant Kit (Cat.
No. 334315). Incubation was performed as described in Table 4 of the QIAseq® FastSelect™
Handbook (according to the treatment of a RIN of <3 samples). The reaction mixture
for this step was as follows: 10 µL of the RNA sample containing 500 ng of RNA, 4 µL
of fragmentation buffer (MGI), 4 µL of directional RT Buffer 1 (MGI), 1 µL of diluted
directional RT buffer 2 (MGI), and 1 µL of QIAseq FastSelect −rRNA plant reagent. RT
enzyme mix (MGI) was only added after this incubation, before the reverse transcription
step. The rest of the library preparation protocol was not modiﬁed from the manufacturer’s
protocol. The DNBSEQ-G400RS High-Throughput Sequencing Set (MGI Tech Co., Cat. No.
1000016950) was used for sequencing. Sequencing was performed on a DNBSEQ G400
sequencer (MGI Tech Co.) by the Latvian Biomedical Research and Study Centre (Riga,
Latvia) on May 20, 2023. The manufacturer’s standard protocol was used for sequencing.
The CLC Genomics Workbench v.23 was used for data import, and the CLC Genomics
Workbench v.21.0.5 (including the Blast2GO commercial plugin v.1.21.14 (BioBam Bioinfor-
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2024, 25, 11375 10 of 13
matics S.L., Valencia, Spain)) was used for data analysis and annotation. The data analysis
workﬂow was as follows: demultiplexing (automatically performed by the sequencer), trim-
ming (settings: quality limit—0.05; max. number of ambiguous nucleotides—2; no adapter
trimming; trim homopolymers; no terminal nucleotide removal; and max. length—150 ),
RNA-seq analysis (settings: no spike-in controls; mismatch cost—2; insertion cost—3;
deletion cost—3; length fraction—0.8; similarity fraction—0.8; no global alignment; strand-
speciﬁc—both; library type—bulk; max. number of hits for a read—10; count paired reads
as two—no; expression value—total counts; and create reads track—yes), differential gene
expression analysis (settings: technology—whole-transcriptome RNA-Seq; ﬁlter on average
expression for FDR correction—no; metadata table—yes; test differential expression due to
WPI (weeks post-inoculation); controlling for—not set; and comparisons—all group pairs),
and the selection of the differentially expressed genes to perform annotation using the
Blast2GO plugin (settings: blast program—blastx-fast; Blast DB = nr; and mapping using
Goa version 2022_08). The mapping of reads to a reference transcriptome of H. annosum
was performed [51,63] (settings: masking mode—no masking; update contigs—no; match
score—1; mismatch cost—2; cost of insertions and deletions—linear gap cost; insertion
cost—3; deletion cost—3; length fraction—0.5; similarity fraction—0.8; no global alignment;
auto-detect paired distances; and non-speciﬁc match handling—map randomly) to be able
to calculate the percentage of H. annosum reads. The reads were also mapped against the
transcriptome of P . sylvestrisfrom Wachowiak et al., 2015 [64] using the same settings.
A gene (transcript) was considered differentially expressed if the comparison between
time points produced a statistically signiﬁcantly different count of reads mapped onto
the transcript in question with a p-value below 0.01. The results are expressed as fold
changes comparing different time points (with four biological replicates for each time
point). Calculations of the differential gene expression-related parameters were performed
using the differential gene expression analysis tool in the CLC Genomics Workbench
software, (see paragraphs 31.6 and 31.6.4 in the manual [65] for more details). Differential
gene expression analysis was performed only for H. annosum genes.
For the visualization of the differential expression, the online tool for up to 6-group
Venn diagram creation InteractiVenn was used [66]. The visualization of the other data
was performed using the tools in the CLC Genomics Workbench software v.21.0.5 and the
Blast2GO plugin v.1.12.14.
5. Conclusions
This study indicates that carbohydrate and lignin degradation gene transcription is
essential for the pathogenicity of H. annosum s.s. against P . sylvestris, similar to the results
reported by Kovalchuk et al. [ 30] in a study on the interaction between Norway spruce
and H. annosum s.l. In addition, the results from this study suggest that lipid metabolism
has a signiﬁcant role starting from week two post-inoculation. Our data suggest that a
number of lipid metabolism pathway genes, in addition to the delta-12 fatty acid desaturase
gene, are involved in pathogenicity. Many of the differentially expressed genes were not
annotated, and improved annotation of a reference transcriptome of H. annosum would
provide additional insights into processes occurring during the early stage infection in the
H. annosum–P . sylvestrispathosystem.
