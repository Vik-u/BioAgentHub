Abstract
In C4 plants, the enzymatic machinery underpinning photosynthesis can vary, with,
for example, three distinct C4 acid decarboxylases being used to release CO2 in the
vicinity of RuBisCO. For decades, these decarboxylases have been used to classify
C4 species into three biochemical sub-types. However, more recently, the notion that
C4 species mix and match C4 acid decarboxylases has increased in popularity, and as
a consequence, the validity of specific biochemical sub-types has been questioned.
Using five species from the grass tribe Paniceae, we show that, although in some
species transcripts and enzymes involved in multiple C4 acid decarboxylases accumu-
late, in others, transcript abundance and enzyme activity is almost entirely from one
decarboxylase. In addition, the development of a bundle sheath isolation procedure
for a close C3 species in the Paniceae enables the preliminary exploration of C4 sub-
type evolution.

1 | INTRODUCTION
C4 photosynthesis is often considered the most productive mecha-
nism by which plants convert sunlight into chemical energy (Kopriva &
Weber, 2021; Niklaus & Kelly, 2019; Sage, 2004; Wang et al., 2012).
The C4 pathway leads to increased photosynthetic efficiency because
high concentrations of CO2 are supplied to RuBisCO. Since its discov-
ery in the 1960s (Hatch & Slack, 1966), a unified understanding of the
biochemistry underpinning C4 photosynthesis has emerged. This basic
system comprises a biochemical pump that initially fixes HCO3
/C0 into
C4 acids in mesophyll (M) cells. Subsequently, diffusion of these C4
acids into a separate compartment, followed by their decarboxylation,
generates high concentrations of CO2 around RuBisCO. In many C4
plants, the release of CO 2 occurs in bundle sheath (BS) cells
(Furbank, 2016; Hatch, 1992; von Caemmerer et al., 2017). Although
this pump demands additional ATP inputs, in warm environments
where RuBisCO catalyzes high rates of oxygenation (and therefore
photorespiration), the C
4 pathway increases photosynthetic efficiency
compared with the ancestral C3 state.
Elucidation of the C4 pathway was initially based on analysis of
sugarcane (Saccharum spp. L.) and maize (corn,Zea mays L.), which
both use the chloroplastic NADP-DEPENDENT MALIC ENZYME
(NADP-ME) to release CO
2 in BS cells. However, it became apparent
that not all species used this chloroplastic enzyme. For example,

Megathyrsus maximus (formerly Panicum maximum), Urochloa texanum
(formerly Panicum texanum), andSporobolus poirettiused the cytosolic
enzyme PHOSPHONENOLPYRUVATE CARBOXYKINASE (PEPCK)
(Edwards et al., 1971) to release CO
2 in the BS, whereas Atriplex
spongiosa and Panicum miliaceum showed high activities of the mito-
chondrial NAD-DEPENDENT MALIC ENZYME (NAD-ME) (Hatch &
Kagawa, 1974). These findings led to the consensus that different C
4
species made preferential use of one C 4 acid decarboxylase and
resulted in the classification of C4 plants into one of three distinct bio-
chemical pathways (Edwards et al., 1971; Hatch et al., 1975; Hatch &
Kagawa, 1976). According to Furbank (2016), there was some early
discussion about whether the sub-types were mutually exclusive or if
one species might employ two or more sub-types together, but in
general, the sub-types were described as distinct (Hatch, 1987).
For several decades, this description of three sub-types has been
standard practice (Hibberd & Covshoff, 2010; Sheen, 1999) and even
used in taxonomic classification (Brown, 1977). However, more recent
work has provided evidence that some C
4 species use multiple C4 acid
decarboxylases. Maize, for example, was traditionally classified as
using NADP-ME, but evidence has mounted that it and sugarcane
both have high activities of PEPCK (Bellasio & Griffiths, 2013; Cacefo
et al., 2019; Furbank, 2011; Koteyeva et al., 2015; Majeran
et al., 2010; Pick et al., 2011; Sharwood et al., 2014; Walker
et al., 1997; Wang et al., 2014; Weissmann et al., 2016; Wingler
et al., 1999). This blurring of the NADP-ME C
4 sub-type coincided
with observations that many plants with high amounts of PEPCK also
contained either NADP-ME or NAD-ME (Furbank, 2011). Further-
more, computational models of the C
4 pathways suggested that BS
energy requirements could not be met in a system with only PEPCK
decarboxylation (Wang et al., 2014). It has therefore been suggested
that PEPCK may never function on its own as a distinct sub-type
(Bräutigam et al., 2014; Furbank, 2011; Wang et al., 2014).
Alternatives to the three sub-type classification have since been
proposed and used in a number of recent publications. These include
a two-sub-type system (based on the use of NADP-ME or NAD-ME),
as well as a four-sub-type classification placing species into NADP-
ME, NAD-ME, NADP-ME + PEPCK, and NAD-ME + PEPCK sub-
types (Rao & Dixon, 2016; Wang et al., 2014; Washburn et al., 2015).
At present, none of these classification schemes have been widely
adopted by the community. Moreover, convincing experimental evi-
dence (i.e., transcriptomic or proteomic data) that species traditionally
defined as belonging to the PEPCK sub-type actually use another C
4
acid decarboxylation enzyme at a higher level than PEPCK is lacking,
whereas enzyme activity measurements in the older literature indicate
strong PEPCK predominance for several species (Gutierrez
et al., 1974; Lin et al., 1993; Prendergast et al., 1987).
Only one group of species, the tribe Paniceae (Poaceae) has been
documented to contain all three classical biochemical sub-types of C
4
photosynthesis together in a pattern consistent with a single C4 origin
(Sage et al., 2011). The subtribe Cenchrinae consists of species using
the classical NADP-ME C4 sub-type, the subtribe Melinidinae the
PEPCK sub-type, and the Panicinae the NAD-ME sub-type (Gutierrez
et al., 1974; Lin et al., 1993; Prendergast et al., 1987). The subtribes
Cenchrinae, Melinidinae, and Panicineae (CMP) form a well-supported
phylogenetic clade of C
4 species with many C3 species sister to the
clade (Grass Phylogeny Working Group II, 2012; Vicentini et al., 2008;
Washburn et al., 2015). Studies based solely or predominantly on
nuclear genes have confirmed this CMP clade, but nuclear gene phy-
logenies show a slightly different relationship between the CMP clade
and other species in the Paniceae by placing the subtribe
Anthephorineae as sister to the CMP clade and the C
3 relatives then
sister to this combined clade. These phylogenies support a CMPA
clade of C
4 species potentially sharing a single C3 ancestor (Vicentini
et al., 2008; Washburn et al., 2017). This clade is here referred to as
the CMP(A) clade in order to indicate the incongruence found
between nuclear and chloroplast phylogenies (Figure 1). The analyses
here performed are equally valid regardless of the inclusion of
Anthephorineae.
How and why C
4 photosynthesis and its sub-types evolved has
been investigated for many years (Langdale, 2011;
Raghavendra, 1980; Rawsthorne, 1992; Sage, 2001, 2004; Sage
et al., 2012; Schluter & Weber, 2020). Current hypotheses suggest an
intermediate C
3–C4 stage in which a photorespiratory pump operated
(Blätke & Bräutigam, 2019; Bräutigam & Gowik, 2016; Heckmann
et al., 2013; Mallmann et al., 2014; Sage, 2004; Sage et al., 2012).
Each C
4 sub-type would require at least some distinct evolutionary
innovations, and the question of how or why multiple sub-types
would evolve from the same C 3 ancestor remains unanswered,
although some evidence suggests it could be related to light quality
and/or nutrient availability (Arp et al., 2021; Blätke &
Bräutigam, 2019; Pinto et al., 2016; Sonawane et al., 2018).
To better determine whether the PEPCK pathway represents a
true biochemical sub-type and investigate the extent to which C
4 spe-
cies make use of mixtures of C4 acid decarboxylases, global patterns
of mRNA abundance were assessed from BS- and M-enriched sam-
ples across phylogenetically spaced C
4 plants that were traditionally
defined as exclusively using one of each of the C4 sub-types. These
species belong to each subtribe of the CMP(A) described above. The
C3 species Sacciolepis indica, another member of the Paniceae and sis-
ter to the CMP(A) clade (sister to CMP in chloroplast phylogeny and
sister to CMPA in nuclear phylogeny), was included in the analysis to
provide insight into the ancestral state and evolutionary transition
from C
3 to different C4 sub-types (Washburn et al., 2015, 2017). A
simple method was developed for isolating BS cells from the C3 spe-
cies S. indica.
2 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 | Plant materials
Accessions from five plant species were used in this study:Setaria
italica yugu1, Urochloa fusca LBJWC-52, Panicum hallii FIL2, Digitaria
californica PI 364670, and S. indica PI 338609. More details on the
accessions can be found in Washburn et al. (2015) with exception of
P. hallii FIL2, obtained from Thomas Juenger of the University of
2o f1 4 WASHBURN ET AL.

phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/.
Plant materials for RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) were grown in
controlled growth chambers at the University of Missouri in Columbia.
Plants were grown under 16 h of light (from 6:00 a.m. to 8:00 p.m.)
and 8 h of darkness with temperatures of 23
/C14C during the day and
20/C14C at night. Lights were placed between 86 and 88 cm above the
plants providing approximately 250μmol of light at plant level. Plant-
ings were grown in four replicates in a completely randomized design
with 32 plants per replicate (except forS. indica where plants were
smaller and grown with 64 plants per replicate). The third leaf was
sampled between 11:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. using established leaf
rolling and mechanical BS isolation methods with some modifications
(see the supporting information) (Chang et al., 2012; Covshoff
et al., 2013; John et al., 2014; Sheen & Bogorad, 1985). Due to time
and cost constraints, only three of the four replicates (each based on a
pool of 32 or 64 plants respectively) were processed for sequencing.
The protocol used for obtaining BS strands inS. indica was the
same as that used for the C
4 species. Variations on the amount of
time for each blending step were investigated, but only resulted in
higher levels of contamination as viewed under a microscope. That
said, even when microscopic examination indicated higher contamina-
tion levels in someS. indica BS samples, transcript abundance levels
were qualitatively similar to samples with less apparent contamina-
tion. One step that may have been key to the isolation of C
3 BS
strands was the use of leaf rolling on the sampled leaves just prior to
the BS strand isolation procedure (Furbank et al., 1985; John
et al., 2014). This enables the removal of at least some M sap prior to
BS isolation.
M-enriched samples where not successfully obtained forS. indica
in this study because of the sensitivity of the C
3 leaves to rolling. Very
small amounts of leaf rolling pressure resulted in the leaves becoming
damaged to the point that the purity of M sap obtained from them
was called into question. Leaves that were rolled gently enough not to
damage the BS strands and contaminate the M sap resulted in sap
with insufficient quantities of RNA for sequencing. It is our opinion
that M sap could be sampled using (1) low-input mRNA extraction and
sequencing procedures, (2) a more precise instrument for leaf rolling
such as that described by Leegood (1985), and/or (3) further experi-
mentation with the developmental stage at which M sap is extracted.
This resulted in a total of 30 samples used for RNA extraction,
sequencing, and analysis, consisting of three replicates of BS and M
(or whole-leaf [WL] tissue for the C
3) respectively for each of the five
species.
2.2 | Sequencing
RNA was extracted using the PureLink® RNA Mini Kit (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA), and mRNA-Seq libraries were constructed and
sequenced by the University of Missouri DNA Core Facility using the
TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, Inc., San Diego,
CA, USA) and the Illumina HiSeq and NextSeq platforms.
2.3 | Analysis
Each mRNA sample was quality trimmed and mapped to theSorghum
bicolor genome Version 3.1.1 (DOE-JGI, 2017; Paterson et al., 2009).
All species were mapped toS. bicolor because reference genomes do
not exist for some of the species in this study and the reference
genomes that do exist are of variable quality leading to bias. Mapping
all species toS. bicolor, which is equally related to all, also allows for
orthology assignment during the mapping step as opposed to later in

the process. This resulted in mapping rates of around 50% for all spe-
cies. Although this is a low mapping rate compared with typical within
species mapping experiments, it is sufficient for comparing the
expression of most genes, particularly those that are well conserved
across species, such as the photosynthesis-related genes here exam-
ined. Raw sequence was processed using Trimmomatic and Trinity
v2.8.4 following the workflows outlined on the Trinity website (Bolger
et al., 2014; Grabherr et al., 2011; Haas et al., 2013). This processing
included the use of eXpress and Bowtie2 for read mapping and cou-
nting as well as edgeR and DESeq2 for differential expression analysis
(Langmead & Salzberg, 2012; Li & Dewey, 2011; Love et al., 2014;
McCarthy et al., 2012; Robinson et al., 2010). A list of known C
4 pho-
tosynthesis genes was compiled on the basis of the literature; a cus-
tom script and BLAST were then used to find the appropriate
homologous genes and to compare their relative abundance levels
(Bräutigam et al., 2014; Camacho et al., 2009; Chang et al., 2012;
Covshoff et al., 2013; John et al., 2014; Rao et al., 2016; Tausta
et al., 2014). For comparisons across all cell types and species within
this study, the trimmed mean of M-values (TMM) method described
by Robinson and Oshlack (2010) as implemented in DESeq2 was used.
Adjusted p values were calculated by the software and represent an
adjustment to the standardp value to account for multiple testing. All
scripts and workflows used in the analysis can be found in a Bitbucket
repository at https://bitbucket.org/washjake/paniceae_c4_m_bs_
mrna/.
2.4 | Enzyme assays
Enzyme activity assays were performed on the basis of methods
described in (Ashton et al., 1990; Marshall et al., 2007). Samples were
grown in growth chambers at the University of Cambridge, UK, and
growth conditions were matched as closely as possible to those
above. The temperature was a constant 20
/C14C, 60% humidity,
300-μmol light at plant level, and 16 h of light. Plants were sampled at
a similar age, growth stage, and leaf to the RNA-Seq samples. Samples
were prepared by grinding leaf tissue with a pestle and mortar in
extraction buffer and then centrifuged at 13,000g, and supernatant
was taken.
Preliminary experiments were carried out to ensure that all
enzyme assays performed linearly across different concentrations. For
PEPCK assays, we used the Walker and Leegood method that was
developed to reduce proteolysis and which has been used extensively
(Häusler et al., 2001; Marshall et al., 2007; Sharwood et al., 2016;
Sommer et al., 2012; Walker et al., 1995). PEPCK extraction buffer
consisted of 200-mM bicine–KOH, pH 9.0, 20-mM MgCl
2, and 5-mM
DTT. NAD-ME extraction buffer consisted of 50-mM HEPES–NaOH
pH 7.2, 50-mM tricine, 2-mM MnCl2, 5-mM DTT, 0.25% w/v PVP
40000, and 0.5% Triton X-100. NADP-ME extraction buffer consisted
of 50-mM HEPES–KOH pH 8.3, 50-mM tricine, 5-mM DTT, and
0.1-mM EDTA.
For PEPCK activity, assay buffer contained of 80-mM MES –
NaOH pH 6.7, 0.35-mM NADH, 5-mM DTT, 2-mM MnCl
2, 2-mM
ADP, and 50-mM KHCO 3. Background rates were measured for
5 min, then 1.2 U of malate dehydrogenase was added, and rates
were measured for a further 5 min. Assays were initiated with the
addition of 2-mM phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP). For NAD-ME activity,
assay buffer contained 25-mM HEPES–NaOH pH 7.2, 5-mM
L-malic
acid, 2-mM NAD, 5-mM DTT, and 0.2-mM EDTA. Background rates
were measured for 5 min, and then 24-mM MnCl
2 and 0.1-mM coen-
zyme A were used to initiate the reaction. For NADP-ME activity,
assay buffer contained 25-mM tricine–KOH pH 8.3, 5-mM L-malic
acid, 0.5-mM NADP, and 0.1-mM EDTA. Background rates were mea-
sured for 5 min, and the assays were initiated with 2-mM MgCl
2.
All assays were performed in 96-well plates at 25/C14C in a CLARI-
Ostar Plus plate reader (BMG Labtech) in 200-μl reactions with absor-
bance at 340 nm measured every 60 s until steady states were
reached. Rates were calculated as the rate of reaction from the initial
slope of the reaction minus any observed background rate. Rates
were normalized to both protein concentration, measured using the
Qubit Protein Assay (Life Technologies), and chlorophyll concentra-
tion, extracted using 80% acetone and calculated as in Porra
et al. (1989).
It should be noted that assaying PEPCK activity is known to be
challenging with several potential sources of error. It has been previ-
ously reported that the forward (decarboxylation) reaction is about
2.6 times faster than the reverse (carboxylation) reaction (Ashton
et al., 1990), but this amount could be greater or less in our species of
interest and depending on conditions. Additionally, N-terminal cleav-
age and rapid loss of activity have been reported in the assay,
although we tried to address this using published methods to reduce
proteolysis and loss of activity by extracting with high pH and DTT
(Walker et al., 1995, 1997). PEPC activity could potentially contribute
to higher than expected levels of PEPCK, but we controlled for this
using a high pH buffer (Ashton et al., 1990). Flexibility in the amount
of PEPCK produced under different conditions, particularly nitrogen,
has also been documented (Arp et al., 2021; Delgado-Alvarado
et al., 2007; Walker et al., 1999). Although care was taken to grow the
RNA and enzyme activity samples in similar conditions, they were
grown at different institutions and may have experienced some slight
differences in environment.
2.5 | RNA in situ hybridization
Each of the genotypes was grown in a climate-controlled growth
chamber at 50% relative humidity in 16:8 light-to-dark cycles at
29.4/C14C and 23.9/C14C day and night temperature, respectively. These
conditions were different from the original mRNA samples due to the
logistics of growth chamber availability. However, because the results
appear to support those from the RNA-Seq at a lower temperature, it
does not appear that this temperature difference had a strong impact.
Replicates of fully expanded leaf three were harvested from each
genotype when plants were at vegetative stage 4 (V4) when the
fourth leaf collar was visible. Along the longitudinal length of the leaf
blade, midsections of blade tissue were dissected in 3.7% FAA at 4
/C14C.
4o f1 4 WASHBURN ET AL.

Samples were vacuum infiltrated and fixed overnight at 4/C14C in 3.7%
FAA. Leaf samples were dehydrated through a graded ethanol series
(50%, 70%, 85%, 95%, and 100%) with three changes in 100% etha-
nol; all changes were 1 h each at 4
/C14C except for the last 100% etha-
nol, which was overnight at 4/C14C. Samples were then passed through a
graded HistoChoice® (Sigma-Aldrich) series (3:1, 1:1, and 1:3 ethanol:
HistoChoice) with three changes in 100% HistoChoice; all changes
were 1 h each at room temperature. Samples were then embedded in
Paraplast Plus® (McCormick Scientific), sectioned to 10 μm, and
hybridized as described previously (Strable & Satterlee, 2021). Two
fragments for PEPCK consisted of 450 bp of the CDS (synthesized
from JSC4-6 and JSC4-7 primers) and 456 bp of the 3
0 end that
included UTR (JSC4-4 and JSC4-5). Two fragments forNADP-ME con-
sisted of 790 bp of the CDS (JSC4-8 and JSC4-9) and 286 bp of the
30 end that included UTR (JSC4-10 and JSC4-11). Fragments were
subcloned into pCR 4-TOPO (Invitrogen) and confirmed by Sanger
sequencing. Antisense or sense strand digoxygenin-UTP labeled RNA
was generated forPEPCK and NADP-ME using a DIG RNA labeling kit
(Roche). For PEPCK hybridizations, equal amounts of the two probes
for PEPCK were mixed prior to hybridization. Similarly, forNADP-ME
hybridizations, equal amounts of the two probes forNADP-ME were
mixed prior to hybridization. Primer sequences for RNA in situ probes
are provided in Table S4.
3 | RESULTS
3.1 | M and BS extraction and distribution of
transcripts encoding components of the C4 cycle
Four C4 species from the Paniceae tribe were chosen to represent
the CMP(A) subtribes in the Paniceae (Figure 1).S. italica for Cen-
chrinae (NADP-ME), U. fusca for Melinidinae (PEPCK), P. hallii for
Panicinae (NAD-ME), and D. californica for Anthephorineae (NADP-
ME). S. indica was chosen to represent the closest C3 relative to the
group.
Microscopic examination of leaves ofS. italica, U. fusca, P. hallii,
and D. californica, from which M-cell contents had been extracted,
showed bands of cells containing low chlorophyll content
(Figure 2a–d) a phenotype consistent with efficient removal of M con-
tent (Covshoff et al., 2013; John et al., 2014). In addition, after
mechanical isolation of leaves, BS preparations of high purity for all C
4
species were generated (Figure 2a–d). Separation of BS strands was
also successful for the C3 species S. indica, something that to our
knowledge has not been successful in any other C 3 species
(Figure 2e). Analysis of transcripts derived from important C4 genes
showed clear differences in abundance between M and BS samples
from the C4 species. For example, transcripts derived fromCARBONIC
ANHYDRASE (CA), PHOSPHOENOLPYRUVATE CARBOXYLASE (PEPC),
and PYRUVATE, ORTHOPHOSPHATE DIKINASE (PPDK) genes prefer-
entially accumulated in M cells (Figure 3a and Table S1). In contrast,
transcripts derived from the RUBISCO SMALL SUBUNIT (RBCS) and
RUBISCO ACTIVASE (RCA) as well as either NADP-ME, NAD-ME,o r
PEPCK were more abundant in BS strands (Figure 3b). The abundance
of transcripts relating to C4 photosynthesis in the C3 species S. indica
was also consistent with current knowledge of metabolism in the BS
of C
3 species. For example, RBCS and RCA were more abundant in
WL samples than in the BS.
3.2 | Some Paniceae lineages use classical sub-
types, and others mix C4 acid decarboxylases
S. italica , classically considered an NADP-ME sub-type species,
showed high transcript levels for NADP-ME and NADP-MDH in BS
and M cells, respectively (Figure 4a). In addition, consistent with the
NADP-ME sub-type, in BS strands ofS. italica, transcripts encoding
PEPCK, NAD-ME, NAD-MDH, ASP-AT, and ALA-AT were detected at
low levels. Enzyme activity assays also indicated high levels of
NADP-ME in S. italica (Figures 5 and 6). Surprisingly, high levels of
PEPCK enzyme activity were also found inS. italica, but this was not
the case forPEPCK transcripts. This may be explainable by the differ-
ences in growth chamber conditions between RNA samples and
enzyme activity samples, differences in cellular locations between the
samples (RNA based on BS isolations and enzyme based on WL tis-
sue), contributions of PEPC or other unknown proteins, or well-
established potential sources of error in the PEPCK assay (see
Section 2). Previous studies onS. italica and many of its close rela-
tives have indicated very low levels of PEPCK consistent with the
RNA data here presented (Gutierrez et al., 1974; Lin et al., 1993;
Prendergast et al., 1987).
U. fuscais classically thought to exclusively usePEPCK to release
CO
2 in the BS. The patterns of transcript accumulation in M and BS
strands ofU. fuscaare consistent withPEPCK functioning in this spe-
cies with very little to no supplemental decarboxylation from either
NADP-ME or NAD-ME (Figure 4b). BS strands contained barely detect-
able levels of transcripts encodingNADP-ME, low levels forNAD-ME,
and very high levels forPEPCK. Enzyme activity inU. fuscawas consis-
tent with transcript abundances, but showed even smaller percent-
ages of NADP-ME and NAD-ME relative to PEPCK than the
transcriptomes (Figures 5 and 6). In addition, consistent with the
cycling of aspartate and alanine between the two cell types, tran-
scripts derived from genes encoding bothASP-AT and ALA-AT were
detectable in the two cell types (Figure 4b).
P. halliihas been classically considered to use NAD-ME as its pri-
mary decarboxylation enzyme. This assertion is supported by high
levels of transcripts encodingNAD-ME, NAD-MDH, ASP-AT, andALA-
AT (Figure 4c). In addition, unexpectedly high levels of transcripts
encoding NADP-ME were detected in both the transcripts and enzyme
activities of theP. halliiBS (Figure 4c).NAD-ME transcript levels were
still more than twice those ofNADP-ME, and the enzyme assays found
much higher relative levels of NAD-ME than NADP-ME, indicating a
primary use of NAD-ME (Figures 5 and 6).
In the case ofD. californica, which is thought to belong to the
NADP-ME sub-type, although transcripts encoding NADP-ME and
NADP-MDH were abundant in BS and M samples respectively,PEPCK
WASHBURN ET AL. 5o f1 4

levels were more than double those of NADP-ME in the BS
(or perhaps the levels are similar if one considers the possibility that
both NADP-ME genes here mapped are resulting in similar functional
products). Enzyme assay results showed high levels of NADP-ME and
much lower levels of PEPCK consistent with the traditional sub-type
classification of this species (Figures 5 and 6).
To further confirm or refute these findings, RNA in situ hybridiza-
tions were undertaken. Transcript accumulation by in situ hybridiza-
tion experiments were consistent in signal strength with the RNA-Seq
results from above and indicated that the signals clearly localized to
the expected anatomical locations (Figure S1). Previous enzyme assay
results for species closely related to the ones sampled here are also
extremely consistent with the RNA-Seq results (Figure S2). It should
be noted that the conditions for mRNA, in situ, and enzyme assay
sample collection were not identical (see Sections 2 and 4).
3.3 | C4 pathway transporters
Although the decarboxylation enzymes described above have long
been used to classify C4 sub-types, transporters are also important
to each of the sub-type pathways (see Figure 4). The transcript
abundance of various transporters related to C4 photosynthesis was
examined. Some transporters had low or undetectable levels such as

had variable levels of transcript abundance across the species and
showed no obvious correlation with different C 4 sub-types
(Figure 4).
3.4 | C4 transcript abundance levels in the closest
C3 relative to the MPC(A) clade
Transcript abundance levels fromS. indica(C3) were generally consis-
tent with expectations for a C3 species (Figures 3 and 7). RBCS and
RCA were more highly expressed in WL tissue than in BS extracts.
Transcripts related to C4 photosynthesis were also expressed at a low
level in both WL and BS.
Comparisons between the S. indica (C3) BS-enriched and WL
samples showed significant (adjusted p value <.001) BS
overabundance for 912 gene models and WL overabundance for
746 gene models (Table S2). Of these overabundant genes, signifi-
cant Gene Ontology (GO) enrichment (adjusted p value <.05) was
found for 16 different GO terms for the BS and 14 GO terms for the
M (Table S2). The different GO terms enriched in BS cells related to
diverse processes including cellular transport, molecular binding, and
cell wall and membrane components. The WL GO terms related to
photosystems I and II, photosynthesis, and other processes
(Table S2).
3.5 | Gene expression in C3 versus C4 BS cells

expression from a C3 species against BS expression in four closely

related C4 species. A total of 357 gene models displayed significantly
(padj < .001, log2 fold change >2) higher transcript abundance levels
over the C3 BS in all four C4 species in the analysis (Table S3). Many
of these genes are expected, such as photosystem I and II subunits,
cytochrome b6f, cyclic electron chain proteins, Calvin cycle proteins,
cellulose synthase, Pectinacetylesterase, starch synthase, and others.
The remaining genes are potential candidates involved in C4 photo-
synthesis that deserve further molecular and biochemical investiga-
tion (Table S3).
4 | DISCUSSION
4.1 | The PEPCK sub-type
The dominance ofPEPCK transcript and enzyme activity overNADP-
ME and NAD-ME in U. fuscaprovides evidence for the biological rele-
vance of the classical PEPCK sub-type (Figures 4–6 and S2). These
data contrast with proposals that PEPCK cannot function on its own
but rather is always ancillary to one of the other two C

decarboxylases (Bräutigam et al., 2014; Furbank, 2011; Wang
et al., 2014). Although this notion may be true in some cases, the cur-
rent results suggest that it is not the case forU. fusca. Furthermore,
our findings are supported by earlier measurements of enzyme activ-
ity made within the subtribe Melinidinae, where PEPCK was also
shown to be highly dominant over the other sub-types (Gutierrez
et al., 1974; Lin et al., 1993; Prendergast et al., 1987), and also indi-
cate that these differences in activity are due to differences in steady-
state transcript abundance rather than posttranscriptional modifica-
tions that act to suppress accumulation of NADP-ME and NAD-ME.
4.2 | C4 sub-type mixing
Of the four C4 species examined, P. hallii and D. californica show the
most evidence of sub-type mixing. The potential for mixing has previ-
ously been considered inPanicum virgatum, a close relative ofP. hallii
(Meyer et al., 2014; Rao et al., 2016; Rao & Dixon, 2016; Zhang
et al., 2013). Rao et al. (2016) suggested that the high abundance of
NADP-ME transcripts may be accounted for by posttranscriptional or
translational modifications, but experimental evidence for testing that
hypothesis is lacking.

WASHBURN ET AL. 9o f1 4

D. californica also showed some evidence of sub-type mixing. In
this case, NADP-ME and PEPCK transcripts were both reasonably
abundant. Although this species is classically considered to belong to
the NADP-ME sub-type, transcripts encodingPEPCK were more than
double the abundance of those ofNADP-ME. ASP-AT transcript levels,
which are also associated with thePEPCK sub-type, were high as well.
However, enzyme activity data do not support this idea with NADP-
ME having much higher levels than PEPCK. Some of these differences
between transcript and enzyme levels could be due the enzyme activ-
ity assays being carried out on samples from a different growth cham-
ber with somewhat different conditions than the RNA-Seq samples
(see Section 2).
4.3 | S. indicaand the C3 BS
Analysis of transcript abundance in M and BS cells from C3 species
that are closely related to C4 species is critical to understanding how
C4 photosynthesis evolved and how it can be engineered for
enhanced crop production. Although transcripts loaded onto ribo-
somes in the BS of C
3 Arabidopsis thaliana have been assessed, and
this analysis provided insight into the role of the BS in eudicot plants
(Aubry et al., 2014), to our knowledge, there are no equivalent data
from a monocotyledonous lineage in which both C
3 and C4 species
are found. The ability to mechanically isolate intact BS cells indicates
that S. indica has very strong BS cell walls, similar to those found in
C4 species. However, all other currently available data including phy-
logenetic placement and RNA-Seq from this study are consistent
with S. indica being a C3 species. The relatively high levels of C4
related transcripts in the BS ofS. indica are consistent with previous
work on cells around the veins of C3 plants (Brown et al., 2010;
Hibberd & Quick, 2002; Shen et al., 2016). Together, these data sup-
port the concept that some C3 species are preadapted to adopt the
C4 mechanism (Brown et al., 2011; Burgess et al., 2019; Christin
et al., 2009, 2015; Gould, 1989; Reyna-Llorens et al., 2018;
Washburn et al., 2016; Williams et al., 2016). Another potential inter-
pretation of these data is that perhapsS. indica represents a step on
the pathway to becoming a C
3–C4 intermediate, or a reversion to C3
photosynthesis from an ancestral C3–C4 intermediate (Bräutigam &
Gowik, 2016; Sage, 2004).
4.4 | The S. indicaC3 BS shows marked similarities
and differences to the BS in other species
Aubry et al. (2014) investigated the functions ofA. thalianaBS cells by
labeling ribosomes within the cell type and sequencing the mRNA res-
ident in the ribosomes. In general, ourS. indicaBS cells displayed simi-
lar patterns to those seen in Arabidopsis. Of the 912 significantly
overabundant gene models in theS. indica BS, 50 of them haveAra-
bidopsis homologs that were significantly overabundant in BS cells
within the Aubry study (Aubry et al., 2014). These genes have anno-
tated functions relating to transport (nucleotide, peptide, amino acid,
sulfate, metals, and ABS transporters), metal handling, transcription
regulation, protein degradation, cell wall modification, amino acid
metabolism, hormone metabolism, and ATP synthesis. Other func-
tional annotations present in both the Arabidopsis- and S. indica-
upregulated BS gene sets (but not necessarily from homologous
genes) included nitrogen metabolism, glutamine synthetase, trypto-
phan, ethylene-induced signaling and regulation, lipid metabolism, tre-
halose metabolism, phenylpropanoid metabolism, and sulfur
regulation (Table S2).

10 of 14 WASHBURN ET AL.

Similarly to Arabidopsis and maize, several trehalose metabolism
genes were found to be overexpressed within the S. indica BS,
supporting the hypothesis that metabolism of trehalose is an ances-
tral BS function (Aubry et al., 2014; Chang et al., 2012). The data
are also consistent with the hypothesis that BS cells play an impor-
tant role in sulfur transport and metabolism and in nitrogen metab-
olism (Aubry et al., 2014). We do note, however, that some sulfur
metabolism-related genes shown to be enriched in Arabidopsis BS
were actually found to be depleted in theS. indica BS. Overall, the
S. indica BS samples are highly consistent with previous studies on
Arabidopsis and rice BS, indicating both the validity of the mechani-
cal C
3 BS isolation done here and the conservation of C 3
functions across these divergent species (Aubry et al., 2014; Hua
et al., 2021).
4.5 | The evolution of three C4 sub-types in the
MPC(A)
For the majority of C4 genes examined, all five species appear to
use orthologous genes, or at least their transcripts mapped to the
same S. bicolor gene (Figures 4 and 7). This is based on the com-
mon assumption that the highest expressed gene in each species/
tissue is the one being used. For CA, PEPC, PPDK, PPT, NHD,
ALA-AT, NAD-MDH, PEPCK, and NAD-ME, the highest expressed
gene in all species was clearly the same, although in some species,
the gene expression was so low that it is likely nonfunctional.
NADP-MDH, NADP-ME, and ASP-AT are less clear with the
highest gene being different between some species but also often
having high abundance levels for both genes, making it hard to
conclude that the lower gene is not relevant. The lack of good
genomic resources for all species involved makes it difficult to con-
clude if the same genes are in fact being used by all species, and
therefore potentially the result of a single recruitment, or if the
genes are simply close homologs and recruited to C
4 separately in
different lineages.
Ancestral state reconstructions were also performed on the basis
of the transcript abundance and enzyme activity data; however, these
analyses were inconclusive and have been excluded due to the low
phylogenetic sampling of the clade within this study.
5 | CONCLUSIONS
We found that at least one species in the tribe Paniceae appears to
use PEPCK decarboxylation exclusively or nearly so, whereas the
other species examined appear to be of mix sub-type. Analysis of the
C
3 species S. indica, based on the BS isolation method here developed,
showed low levels of C4 transcripts and an amenability to mechanical
BS separation procedures not previously seen in C3 species. These
observations lead us to hypothesize thatS. indicamay lie somewhere
on the spectrum of C3–C4 intermediates or represent a reversion from
an ancestral C3–C4 intermediate.
