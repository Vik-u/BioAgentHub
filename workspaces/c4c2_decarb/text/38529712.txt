INTRODUCTION
The increasing energy demand and concerns over 
the environmental impacts of fossil-  based fuels have 
given biofuels from renewable resources a rising inter -
est. Bio-  based production of renewable alternatives, 
such as ethanol and isobutanol, has been developed 
by adopting biotechnological approaches (Gehrmann & 
Tenhumberg, 2020; Su et al., 2020). Compared to eth-
anol, higher alcohols such as isobutanol have a greater 
energy density, as well as lower hygroscopicity, vola -
tility and corrosivity, which increases their attractive -
ness as advanced biofuels. Furthermore, isobutanol is 
a versatile solvent necessary for various applications, 
such as the production of specialty chemicals, surface 
coatings and adhesives (Fu et al., 2021).
Isobutanol is a four-  carbon, branched chain ali -
phatic alcohol that is not produced naturally in sig -
nificant quantities, although some microbes such as 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae can produce negligible 
amounts of this alcohol (Dickinson et al., 1997, 1998). 
Therefore, a metabolic engineering approach is re -
quired to achieve in vivo production of isobutanol. This 
can be realized by introducing the last two steps of the 
Ehrlich pathway: decarboxylation of branched-  chain 2- 
keto acids to aldehydes by 2-  keto acid decarboxylase

Abstract
Paenibacillus polymyxa is a non-  pathogenic, Gram-  positive bacterium en -
dowed with a rich and versatile metabolism. However interesting, this bac -
terium has been seldom used for bioproduction thus far. In this study, we 
engineered P. polymyxa for isobutanol production, a relevant bulk chemical 
and next- generation biofuel. A CRISPR- Cas9- based genome editing tool fa-
cilitated the chromosomal integration of a synthetic operon to establish isob -
utanol production. The 2,3-  butanediol biosynthesis pathway, leading to the 
main fermentation product of P.  polymyxa, was eliminated. A mutant strain 
harbouring the synthetic isobutanol operon ( kdcA from Lactococcus lactis , 
and the native ilvC , ilvD and adh  genes) produced 1 g L−1 isobutanol under 
microaerobic conditions. Improving NADPH regeneration by overexpres -
sion of the malic enzyme subsequently increased the product titre by 50%. 
Network- wide proteomics provided insights into responses of P.  polymyxa 
to isobutanol and revealed a significant metabolic shift caused by alcohol 
production. Glucose-  6- phosphate 1- dehydrogenase, the key enzyme in the 
pentose phosphate pathway, was identified as a bottleneck that hindered effi-
cient NADPH regeneration through this pathway. Furthermore, we conducted 
culture optimization towards cultivating P.  polymyxa in a synthetic minimal 
medium. We identified biotin (B7), pantothenate (B5) and folate (B9) to be mu-
tual essential vitamins for P. polymyxa. Our rational metabolic engineering of 
P. polymyxa for the production of a heterologous chemical sheds light on the 
metabolism of this bacterium towards further biotechnological exploitation.

(KDC; the kdcA or kivD gene products), and subsequent 
reduction of aldehydes to alcohols by alcohol dehydro -
genase (ADH; the adh gene product). While ADHs are 
widespread among bacteria, KDCs are scarce and only 
a few bacteria possessing KDCs have been identified 
(De La Plaza et al., 2004 ; Wei et al., 2013 ; Werther 
et al., 2008). Among all of these enzymes, KDCs from 
Lactococcus lactis are the best characterized and have 
been extensively used for the production of higher alco-
hols (Atsumi et al., 2010; Tai et al., 2016).
Isobutanol formation involves a series of reactions 
that starts with the condensation of two molecules 
of pyruvate to acetolactate, catalysed by acetolac -
tate synthase (ALS; the alsS gene product; Figure 1). 
Acetolactate is converted to 2,3-  dihydroxyisovalerate 
by ketol-  acid reductoisomerase (KARI; the ilvC  gene 
product), which is further dehydrated by dihydroxy- 
acid dehydratase (DHAD; the ilvD  gene product) to 
2- ketoisovalerate, the penultimate precursor for L- 
valine biosynthesis. Subsequent decarboxylation by 
KDC forms isobutyraldehyde, which is finally reduced 
to isobutanol by the action of ADH. Overexpression 
of kdcA from L. lactis in combination with the native 
alsS, ilvC, ilvD and adh  is a commonly used strategy 
to achieve heterologous production of isobutanol (Gu 
et al., 2021). Furthermore, the elimination of competing 
pathways and process optimization have been exten -
sively investigated to further increase the product titre. 
Microbial production of isobutanol has been studied 
in different microorganisms, such as Escherichia coli  
(Smith & Liao, 2011), Pseudomonas putida (Ankenbauer 
et al.,  2021), Zymomonas mobilis  (Qiu et al., 2020 ), 
Bacillus licheniformis (Zhan et al., 2021), Bacillus subti-
lis (Li et al., 2012), Corynebacterium glutamicum (Zhan 
et al.,  2021 ), Geobacillus thermoglucosidasius (Lin 
et al., 2014), Pichia pastoris (Siripong et al., 2018) and 
Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Park et al., 2014). Notably, 
high titre isobutanol production (>20 g L−1) has been 
reported for engineered E. coli (Atsumi et  al., 2008). 
Implementation of in situ product removal alleviated 
the isobutanol toxicity and thus realized a titre of about 
50 g L−1 by engineered E. coli and C. glutamicum (Baez 
et al., 2011; Yamamoto et al., 2013 ). For many other 
strains, the reported titres are still relatively low to be 
considered relevant at an industrial scale.
The soil bacterium P.  polymyxa is a facultative an -
aerobe known to naturally produce 2,3-  butanediol 
(2,3- BDO) at high (up to 110 g L−1) titres (Häßler 
et al., 2012). Despite its versatile metabolism and 
biochemical capability, research on P.  polymyxa has 
been circumscribed to its isolation from natural hab -
itats and characterization of antimicrobial activities

METABOLIC ENGINEERING OF P. POLYMYXA
(Blombach et al., 2021 ). Only limited knowledge is 
available in regard to its metabolism, although sev -
eral studies have investigated its 2,3-  BDO and exo -
polysaccharide biosynthesis (Okonkwo et al., 2020 ; 
Schilling et al., 2022 ). For a long time, the lack of 
genetic tools hindered the study of P.  polymyxa and 
development for biotechnological applications. We 
developed a CRISPR-  Cas9-  based genome editing 
tool specifically tailored for this bacterium (Rütering 
et al.,  2017 ). Adopting this toolset in this study, we 
provide a first-  case example of implementing a syn -
thetic pathway for the production of a non-  natural 
compound in P.  polymyxa. In particular, engineering 
of P. polymyxa for isobutanol production is a prom -
ising strategy, as this pathway uses acetolactate as 
one of the main intermediates, similar to 2,3-  BDO 
biosynthesis, which is the main fermentative pathway 
of P. polymyxa (Figure 1). In contrast to acetolactate 
conversion to 2,3-  dihydroxyisovalerate in the isobu -
tanol pathway, this intermediate is decarboxylated 
to acetoin and finally reduced to 2,3-  BDO in the bu -
tanediol biosynthesis. In addition, small amounts of 
lactate, ethanol, formate and acetate are produced 
from the mixed acid fermentative pathway (Schilling 
et al., 2020). Therefore, metabolic engineering strate -
gies to eliminate the formation of 2,3-  BDO and other 
by- products, as well as redirection of the metabolic 
flux towards isobutanol formation, are essential.
In this study, we demonstrated the rational meta -
bolic engineering of P.  polymyxa towards isobutanol 
production. We combined in vitro enzyme assays 
with proteomic analysis to investigate potential bot -
tlenecks, and these findings were used to further 
optimize the pathways towards improving product ti -
tres. Additionally, we developed a synthetic minimal 
medium for P.  polymyxa to reduce production costs. 
Previous works on P.  polymyxa relied on the cultiva -
tion in rich complex media, which often contain a high 
amount of yeast extract and peptone, rather expen -
sive components for bulk chemicals production. Here, 
we provide insights into the complex metabolism of 
P. polymyxa and describe a first-  case example of en -
gineering the bacterium for production of a heterolo -
gous compound.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Bacterial strains
Paenibacillus polymyxa DSM 365 was obtained from 
the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell 
Culture (DSMZ), Braunschweig, Germany. E. coli 
Turbo™ (New England Biolabs) was used for plasmid 
cloning and E. coli S17- 1 (ATCC 47055) was used for 
the DNA transfer to P.  polymyxa via conjugation. The 
strains were cultivated in LB medium (10 g L−1 peptone, 
5 g L−1 yeast extract and 5 g L−1 NaCl) unless stated oth-
erwise. The medium was supplemented with 50 μg mL−1 
of neomycin and 40 μg mL−1 of polymyxin when neces -
sary. P. polymyxa was routinely cultivated at 30°C and 
E. coli strains at 37°C unless stated otherwise. The 
strains were stored in 24% (v/v) glycerol at −80°C for 
long- term storage. All strains used in this study are 
listed in Table S1.
Strain engineering
All plasmids generated in this study were constructed 
by the isothermal assembly and transferred to P.  pol-
ymyxa via conjugation, as previously described 
(Meliawati et al., 2022 ). The genome modifications 
were facilitated by the CRISPR-  Cas9-  based system 
developed for P.  polymyxa (Rütering et al., 2017 ). In 
brief, the guide RNA (gRNA) for targeted genome ed -
iting was designed by using the Benchling CRISPR 
Design Tool. Approximately, 1 kb up-  and down -
stream homologous flanks were used as the repair 
template. For genome integration, the genes of inter -
est were placed in between the homologous repair 
template. For initial screening of the mutants, colony 
PCR (cPCR) was performed using primers which 
bind outside of the homologous repair template. 
Subsequently, the genomic DNA (gDNA) of the mu -
tant strain was isolated and the targeted region was 
amplified via PCR and the genotype was verified via 
sequencing.
The kdcA gene, which is essential for isobutanol pro-
duction, was obtained from the gDNA of L. lactis (Smit 
et al., 2005). Other genes such as ilvC , ilvD and adh  
were amplified from gDNA obtained from P.  polymyxa 
DSM 365. The synthetic operon was constructed by 
combining the native ribosome binding site (RBS) se -
quences and the open reading frames (ORFs) of ilvC , 
ilvD and adh, as well as the ORF of kdcA in one operon. 
No additional RBS was added for kdcA, as the RBS of 
the gene that it replaced ( alsD or bdh) was used. All 
primers and plasmids used in this study are listed in 
Tables S1 and S2.
Microtiter plate cultivations
Growth analysis for evaluation of the isobutanol 
toxicity and optimization of cultivation media were 
performed in 96-  well microtiter plates (Greiner-  
CELLSTAR). To test the isobutanol toxicity, a single 
colony was used to inoculate a 13 mL tube contain -
ing 3 mL of isobutanol fermentation medium. The 
culture was grown overnight at 37°C and 250 rpm. 
Subsequently, 2 μL of the overnight culture was in -
oculated into 200 μL fermentation medium supple -
mented with different concentrations of isobutanol, 
4 of 15 |   
MELIAWATI  et al.
ranging from 0 to 20 g L−1. The plate was sealed with 
a Breathe-  Easy sealing membrane (Sigma-  Aldrich). 
The cultures were cultivated at 37°C with medium 
continuous shaking for 48 h (ELX808; BioTek), and 
the OD 600 was recorded every 15 min. Growth pro -
files and kinetic parameters were analysed using the 
QurvE software (Wirth et al., 2023 ).
For the media optimization, the precultures were 
prepared in their respective media. The isobutanol 
fermentation medium was utilized as the rich me -
dium; de Bont medium was used as the base for the 
minimal medium (Hartmans et al., 1989 ). de Bont 
medium consisted, per litre, the following compo -
nents: 1.55 g K 2HPO4, 0.85 g NaH 2PO4.2H2O, 2.0 g 
(NH4)2SO4, 0.1 g MgCl 2.6H2O, 10 mg EDTA, 2 mg 
ZnSO4.7H2O, 1 mg CaCl 2.2H2O, 5 mg FeSO 4.7H2O, 
0.2 mg Na2MoO4.2H2O, 0.2 mg CuSO 4.5H2O, 0.4 mg 
CoCl2.6H2O and 1 mg MnCl2.2H2O. The medium was 
supplemented with 20  g L−1 glucose, with the addi -
tion of either 0.05 g L−1 yeast extract, 0.05 g L−1 pep -
tone, 0.1 g L−1 amino acid mix (Teknova) or 1:10,000 
Wolfe's vitamin solution, as indicated. Furthermore, 
for the evaluation of single component of the vitamin 
mix, the minimal medium was instead supplemented 
with vitamin B1 (5 μg L−1), B2 (5 μg L−1), B3 (5 μg L−1), 
B5 (5 μg L−1), B6 (10 μg L−1), B7 (2 μg L−1), B9 (2 μg L−1) 
or B12 (0.1 μg L−1).
Isobutanol production and analysis
The fermentation medium composition was adapted 
from previous studies (Okonkwo et al., 2017 ; Schilling 
et al., 2020). The medium consisted of 60 g L−1 glu -
cose, 5 g L−1 yeast extract, 5 g L−1 peptone, 0.2 g L −1 
MgSO4.7H2O, 3.5 g L−1 KH2PO4 and 2.5 g L−1 K2HPO4. 
All medium components were obtained from Carl Roth 
GmbH (Germany) unless indicated differently. P. poly-
myxa strains were streaked on LB agar plates and in -
cubated overnight at 30°C. A single colony was used to 
inoculate a 13-  mL tube containing 3 mL fermentation 
medium, and cultivated overnight at 37°C and 250 rpm. 
Subsequently, 30 μL of this preculture was transferred 
into a fresh 3 mL fermentation medium in a 10- mL glass 
tube and cultivated at 37°C, 250 rpm for 48 h. For shake 
flask cultivation, 50 μL preculture was used to inocu -
late 50 mL medium in a 250 mL shake flask. Following 
the fermentation, 1 mL of the culture was centrifuged 
at 19,000 g for 5 min and the supernatant was filtered 
through a 0.2-  μm PTFE filter. The concentration of 
glucose and fermentative products were measured 
with HPLC-  UV- RID (Dionex, USA) equipped with a 
Rezex ROA- H+ organic acid column (300 mm × 7.8 mm, 
Phenomenex, USA). The column temperature was set 
to 70°C, and 2.5 mM H 2SO4 was used as the mobile 
phase with a flow rate of 0.5 mL min−1 and 55 min run 
time.
In vitro analysis
The strains were cultivated in the isobutanol fermen -
tation medium as described above. The cells were 
harvested at different time points which represented dif-
ferent growth phases: exponential (6 h), late exponential 
(10 h) and stationary phase (24 h). First, the cells were 
centrifuged at 4000 g at 4°C for 10 min. Subsequently, 
the cells were washed with PBS buffer, centrifuged 
again under the same condition and then the pellet was 
resuspended in 0.5 mL PBS buffer. Disruption of cells 
was performed with a bead beater at 6000 rpm for 20 s 
(PRECELLYS 24, Bertin Technologies), followed by 
centrifugation at 17,000 g at 4°C for 2 min. Protein con-
centration in the supernatant was determined using the 
Bradford assay (Bradford, 1976 ), and the supernatant 
was used for further experiments with the cell extract. 
For the investigation of the upper isobutanol pathway, 
5 μg protein was added into a reaction mixture contain-
ing 30 mM pyruvate, 0.5 mM NAD(P)H, 5 mM MgSO 4, 
0.2 mM thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) and PBS buffer, 
with a total reaction volume of 200 μL. For the lower 
isobutanol pathway, 30 mM 2- ketoisovalerate was used 
instead of pyruvate. The assay was performed in a mi -
crotiter plate and the absorption at 340 nm at 37°C was 
recorded every 30 s (ELX808; BioTek).
Proteomics
Paenibacillus polymyxa strains were cultivated in the 
fermentation medium as described above, and har -
vested at desired time points. Two millilitres of culture 
was centrifuged at 17,000 g for 5 min and the pellet was 
stored at −20°C until further use. For the cell lysis, two 
pieces of 3-  mm zirconium oxide beads and 100 μL of 
lysis buffer (6.0 M guanidinium hydrochloride, 5 mM 
tris(2- carboxyethyl)phosphine, 10 mM ClCH2CONH2 and 
100 mM Tris- HCl pH 8.0) were added to the cell pellet and 
the cells were lysed with TissueLyser (Qiagen) at 25 Hz 
for 5 min. The mixture was incubated in a heating block 
at 99°C and 2000 rpm for 10 min and then centrifuged 
at 15,000 g for 10 min. Subsequently, 50 μL of superna-
tant was added with 50 μL of 50 mM NH4HCO3. Protein 
concentration was measured using micro BCA Protein 
Assay Kit (Thermo Scientific) following the standard pro-
tocol. Protein digestion was done with 20 μL of 0.1 μg μL−1 
Trypsin/Lys- C protease mix (Promega) at 37°C for 12 h. 
The reaction was stopped by adding 10 μL of 10% (v/v) 
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) followed by centrifugation at 
15,000 g for 15 min. The peptides were then purified by 
StageTips purification steps (Rappsilber et al., 2007). 
The C18 filter was placed onto a 200 μL C18 StageTips 
and then sequentially washed with 20 μL MeOH, 20 μL 
buffer B (80% (v/v) acetonitrile, 0.1% (v/v) formic acid) 
and 20 μL buffer A (3% (v/v) acetonitrile, 1% (v/v) TFA) 
by centrifugation at 1000 g for 1 min. The peptides were 
   | 5 of 15

loaded through the C18 column at 1500 g for 2 min and 
washed two times with 20 μL of buffer A at 1500 g for 
1 min. The elution was done with 2 × 20 μL of buffer B at 
1000 g for 1 min. The samples were concentrated until a 
volume of ~5 μL in an Eppendorf concentrator, then 0.1% 
(v/v) formic acid was added until a final volume of 20 μL.
Subsequently, the peptides were loaded onto a 2 cm 
C18 trap column (ThermoFisher 164946), connected 
in- line to a 15 cm C18 reverse- phase analytical column 
(Thermo EasySpray ES904) using 0.1% (v/v) formic 
acid at 750 bar, in a Thermo EasyLC 1200 HPLC sys -
tem with a column oven operating at 30°C. The peptides 
were eluted over a 70- min gradient ranging from 10% to 
60% (v/v) of Buffer B at 250 nL min−1, and the Orbitrap 
Exploris instrument (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was run in 
DIA mode with FAIMS ProTM Interface (ThermoFisher 
Scientific) with CV of −45 V. Full MS spectra were col -
lected at a resolution of 120,000, with an AGC target of 
300% or maximum injection time set to ‘auto’ and a scan 
range of 400–1000 m/z. The MS2 spectra were obtained 
in DIA mode in the orbitrap operating at a resolution of 
60,000, with an AGC target of 1000% or maximum injec-
tion time set to ‘auto’, a normalized HCD collision energy 
of 32. The isolation window was set to 6 m/z with a 1 m/z 
overlap and window placement on. Each DIA experiment 
covered a range of 200 m/z resulting in three DIA experi-
ments (400–600, 600–800 and 800–1000 m/z). Between 
the DIA experiments, a full MS scan was performed. MS 
performance was verified for consistency by running com-
plex cell lysate quality control standards, and chromatog-
raphy was monitored to check for reproducibility. The 
raw files were analysed using SpectronautTM (version 
16.2) spectra were matched against the Ppiso- 5 protein 
database. Dynamic modifications were set as Oxidation 
(M) and Acetyl on protein N-  termini. Cysteine carbami-
domethyl was set as a static modification. All results were 
filtered to a 1% FDR, and protein quantitation was done 
on the MS1 level. The data was normalized by RT depen-
dent local regression model (Callister et al., 2006) and 
protein groups were inferred by IDPicker. Statistical anal-
ysis of the proteomics data was performed with the two- 
tailed student's t- test for unequal variances and only the 
data with a p < 0.05 was considered for further data inter-
pretation. The mass spectrometry proteomics data have 
been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via 
the PRIDE (Perez- Riverol et al., 2022) partner repository 
with the dataset identifier PXD048679.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Integration of a synthetic operon to 
establish isobutanol production
By employing the pCasPP system, we integrated kdcA  
from L. lactis into the locus of alsD in the chromosome 
of P. polymyxa (Rütering et al., 2017). Thereby, the open 
reading frame of alsD, which encodes the acetolactate 
decarboxylase, was directly replaced by the one of kdcA, 
thus eliminating the 2,3-  BDO production, which is the 
main fermentative product of P.  polymyxa. In addition, 
the integration circumvents the use of plasmids-  based 
expression and alleviates the need for selection pressure 
for plasmid maintenance. Here, kdcA is placed under 
the transcriptional control of the native promoter of alsD, 
which is induced in the late exponential phase and under 
anaerobic conditions. Hence, this construct allows for a 
period of cell growth before entering the isobutanol pro-
duction phase, thus decoupling growth and production. 
Under micro-  aerobic conditions, the kdcA - harbouring 
strain (Ppiso- 1) produced 0.15 g L−1 of isobutanol.
Paenibacillus polymyxa has four copies of putative 
lactate dehydrogenases (ldh) that might contribute to lac-
tate production. As deletion of one of the ldh was shown 
to improve growth and 2,3-  BDO production (Schilling 
et al., 2020), we deleted this particular gene and gener-
ated the Ppiso- 2 strain. Deletion of the ldh reduced the 
lactate formation and increased the titre to 0.19 g L−1. 
Subsequent insertion of an additional copy of kdcA in 
the locus of bdh  (Ppiso- 3) only resulted in a negligible 
increase of isobutanol titres, which suggests that pre -
cursors supply might in fact be the limiting factor. Next, 
we integrated a synthetic operon consisting of kdcA of 
L. lactis, as well as ilvC, ilvD and adh from P. polymyxa. 
Thus, two copies of the native genes (ilvC, ilvD and adh) 
were present in the P. polymyxa genome. Two different 
ADHs were investigated since previous studies have 
reported different affinity of ADHs towards isobutyralde-
hyde, which subsequently influences its conversion rate 
to isobutanol. Besides yugJ, encoding an iron- containing 
alcohol dehydrogenase, whose orthologue in Bacillus li-
cheniformis was reported to have the highest substrate 
affinity (Zhan et al., 2021), we chose adhA, an orthologue 
of the ADH commonly used for isobutanol production in 
engineered E. coli (Smith & Liao, 2011). Cultivation of the 
strains carrying the operon with yugJ (Ppiso- 4) or adhA 
(Ppiso- 5) resulted in 0.68 and 1.1 g L−1 isobutanol produc-
tion respectively (Figure 2A).
Besides isobutanol, the engineered strains also 
produced other byproducts such as ethanol, lactate, 
acetate and interestingly meso-  BDO. P. polymyxa 
is known for its ability to produce stereoisomer-  pure 
R,R- BDO, but not meso- BDO, as its genome does not 
encode an acetoin racemase or diacetyl reductase, 
which are thought to be essential for its production 
(Petrov & Petrova,  2021). As meso-  BDO is produced 
under micro-  aerobic conditions in the absence of the 
R,R- BDO pathway, this hints at its importance for 
NAD+ regeneration. Consequently, shake flask culti -
vation of the Ppiso-  5 strain, which imposes less oxy -
gen limitation than the tube cultivation, resulted in an 
11- fold decrease of meso-  BDO while maintaining the 
isobutanol titre ( Figure 2A). Although ethanol pro -
duction is theoretically a more efficient way for NAD + 
6 of 15 |   
MELIAWATI  et al.
regeneration, P. polymyxa seems to favour BDO pro -
duction ( Figure S1), as observed in a previous study 
(Schilling et al., 2020). This behaviour might indicate 
the high activity of ALS. Many Bacilli, such as B. subtilis 
and B. licheniformis, are known to have highly active 
ALS enzymes (Atsumi et al., 2009; Huo et al., 2018). 
Hence, it is plausible that the meso-  BDO originated 
from the spontaneous reaction of acetolactate into dia -
cetyl, which was then converted to acetoin and further 
to meso- BDO (Dorau et al., 2019).
Evaluation of potential metabolic 
bottlenecks and competing pathways
The production profile of the fermentative compounds 
revealed that isobutanol synthesis occurred in a very 
narrow window from 8 to 12 h ( Figure 2B). About 
0.33 g L−1 isobutanol was detected after 10 h of cultiva-
tion and the amount tripled at 12 h. However, the pro -
duction stalled afterwards and no significant increase 
in isobutanol titre was observed. In contrast, other fer -
mentation products, such as, meso-  BDO and lactate, 
continued to increase until around 32 h of cultivation. By 
the end of the cultivation, a high amount of glucose was 
still present and thus the stop in isobutanol production 
was not caused by carbon source limitation (Table S3).
Previous studies have reported isobutanol toxic -
ity and microbial strains showed varying tolerance to 
isobutanol (Gupta et al., 2020; Wilbanks & Trinh, 2017). 
To evaluate whether the stop of isobutanol production 
was due to toxicity, we cultivated the wild-  type strain 
with different concentrations of isobutanol, ranging 
from 0 to 20 g L−1 (Figure 2C). The strain was passed 
directly into the isobutanol- supplemented medium with-
out prior exposure to isobutanol. Higher concentrations 
than 8 g L−1 isobutanol led to an extended lag phase, 
most likely because the strain needs time to adapt to the 
isobutanol- containing media by altering the expression 
of several genes. However, this was not the case for 
concentrations below 8  g L−1 and the maximum growth 
rates (μmax) remained stable at 0.6–0.8 h−1 (Figure 2D, 
Table S4). Altogether, this result shows that the toxicity 
was not responsible for the abrupt interruption of isobu-
tanol production, since the Ppiso-  5 strain reached only 
a concentration of ~1 g L−1 isobutanol.
As toxicity was ruled out to cause the limited isobu -
tanol production, we turned our attention to gene ex -
pression and enzyme activity as the limiting factors. 
To obtain insight about which enzymes are produced 
and are active at different growth phases, we deter -
mined the specific activity of the enzymes of the isobu-
tanol pathway at different growth phases. To this end, 
we prepared cell lysates from P.  polymyxa at different 
time points during cultivation. Furthermore, we divided 
the pathway into an upper and a lower part for anal -
ysis (Figure 3A). As KARI and ADH are NADPH and 
NADH- dependent, respectively, the enzyme activity 
of each part was quantified by following the consump -
tion of these cofactors. For the upper part, pyruvate

and NADPH were added to the reaction, while for the 
lower part 2-  ketoisovalerate and NADH were supple -
mented. The activity of all enzymes was measured 
under substrate saturation conditions. Interestingly, 
the activity of ALS and KARI, in the upper pathway, 
was already detected at 6 h with a specific activity of 
37 ± 2 nmol min−1 mg−1, and the rate increased to 57 ± 2 
and 49 ± 1 nmol min−1 mg−1 at 10 and 24 h respectively 
(Figure 3B; Figure S2). The activity of enzymes of the 
lower pathway part, KDC and ADH, was relatively low 
at 6 h (31 ± 3 nmol min−1 mg−1) but reached 160 ± 6 and 
111 ± 3 nmol min−1 mg−1 at 10 and 24 h respectively 
(Figure 3C, Figure S3). Thus, this observation helps 
explaining why isobutanol concentration strongly in -
creases around 10 h. These findings suggested that op-
timization of the expression pattern of the last two steps 
of the pathway, starting from 2-  ketoisovalerate, might 
enable early isobutanol production, and thus extending 
the production phase.
Given that the specific activity of the lower path -
way is greater than 160 ± 6 nmol min −1 mg−1 at the 
early stationary phase, a productivity of 4.71 g L−1 h−1 
could theoretically be realized at the final biomass 
concentration (OD 600 = 3), if precursor supply was not 
limited. In contrast, the measured productivity was 
only 0.35 g L−1 h−1 ( Figure S4). As the theoretical pro -
ductivity far exceeds the measured productivity, we 
suspected that inadequate precursors supply, that is, 
pyruvate, NADH or NADPH was limiting the formation 
of isobutanol.
Engineering redox balance to boost 
isobutanol biosynthesis
The growth and production profile over time showed 
an interesting correlation between growth and isobu -
tanol production. It was observed that the cells actively 
produced isobutanol only during the late exponential 
growth phase and early stationary phase. While the 
onset of production is limited by the expression of the 
genes in the lower part of the isobutanol pathway, as 
seen before, the abrupt stop of production when en -
tering the stationary phase, while other NADH and 
FIGURE 3  Assaying the isobutanol pathway enzymes in Paenibacillus polymyxa  cell lysate. (A) For the analysis, the pathway was 
divided into two parts: an upper, NADPH-  dependent part (in blue) and a lower NADH-  dependent part (in yellow). The combined activity 
of the enzymes of the upper part was measured with the substrates pyruvate and NADPH (B), while the lower part was probed with 
2- ketoisovalerate and NADH (C). The cell lysates were obtained from the Ppiso-  5 strain harvested at early exponential (6 h), late exponential 
(10 h) and stationary growth phases (24 h); n.d., not detected. The bar graphs represent mean values, and the error bars indicate the 
standard deviation obtained from three biological replicates. A p < 0.05 was considered in determining the significant differences between 
the samples (**p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 and ****p < 0.0001).

pyruvate- dependent fermentation products are still 
formed, hints at a limited NADPH supply. This could be 
caused by reduced flux during the late stationary phase 
through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, which is one 
of the main generators of cellular NADPH (Spaans 
et al., 2015). NADPH limitation has been known as a 
general challenge for isobutanol production, as glyco -
lysis yields two molecules of NADH while isobutanol 
formation from pyruvate requires one NADPH and one 
NADH molecule. Previous studies have reported dif -
ferent approaches to overcome this bottleneck, such 
as overexpression of transhydrogenase, malic enzyme 
or NAD kinase (Blombach & Eikmanns, 2011 ; Shi 
et al., 2013). However, these approaches have met with 
varying degrees of success, depending on the micro -
bial strain. Therefore, we manipulated the redox bal -
ance of P. polymyxa for isobutanol production through 
different approaches.
The conversion of acetolactate to 
2,3- dihydoxyisovalerate via the NADPH-  dependent 
KARI is the main reason for the redox imbalance of 
the isobutanol pathway. Therefore, changing the co -
factor specificity of KARI from NADPH to NADH might 
alleviate this problem. A previous study demonstrated 
the successful protein engineering of KARI from E. coli 
into an NADH-  dependent variant which resulted in 
improved isobutanol production (Bastian et  al., 2011). 
Similarly, the cofactor specificity of KARI from L. lac -
tis was changed (Brinkmann- Chen et al., 2013). As the 
orthologous form from L. lactis is closely related to the 
one from P. polymyxa, both contain a six-  residue β2αB 
loop which determines cofactor specificity, the muta -
tions from L. lactis were mimicked (Figure S5). To this 
end, the amino acid sequences were aligned and the 
R49P, K52L and S53D mutations were applied to the 
KARI of P.  polymyxa. These changes in KARI yielded 
the strain Ppiso- 6. Unfortunately, the engineered KARI 
was detrimental to isobutanol production and reduced 
the titre (0.32 g L−1) by 70% compared to the Ppiso-  5 
strain ( Table S3). This shows that the beneficial mu -
tations are not readily transferable from one ortholo -
gous form to another. By that, random mutagenesis 
might be necessary to increase the catalytic activity of 
cofactor- swapped variants to a level close to the wild 
type (Brinkmann- Chen et al., 2013).
As the approach to switch the redox cofactor depen-
dency of the isobutanol pathway was not successful, 
we explored other approaches to boost the NADPH 
generation to ensure sufficient cofactor supply for 
isobutanol production ( Figure 4A). Consequently, we 
deleted the glucose-  6- phosphate isomerase ( pgi), 
which is a glycolytic gene responsible for the conver -
sion of glucose-  6- phosphate to fructose- 6- phosphate 
in the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas (EMP) pathway. 
As P. polymyxa does not encode an active Entner–
Doudoroff (ED) pathway, the carbon flux is redirected 
through the pentose phosphate (PP) pathway. The PP 
pathway utilizes NADP, whereas the EMP pathway 
uses NAD. However, the pgi  deletion in the Ppiso-  7 
strain did not improve the isobutanol titre compared 
to the Ppiso-  5. Although the by-  products were signifi -
cantly reduced as the titre of meso-  BDO, lactate and 
ethanol decreased by more than 85%. As most Bacilli 
mainly utilize the EMP pathway for glucose metabolism 
(Wushensky et al., 2018), Ppiso- 7 consumed less glu -
cose than the other strains ( Table S3). However, the 
strain seems to have reached fine-  tuned activity of the 
isobutanol pathway, rendering this alcohol as the main 
fermentation product. Likewise, by- product formation is 
minimized at the expense of overall lower productivity.
Aiming to pursue higher product titers, we further 
explored another approach to improve NADPH regen -
eration by incorporating an NADP-  dependent malic 
enzyme (maeB) in the synthetic operon. The malic en -
zyme is responsible for the decarboxylation of malate 
to pyruvate and CO 2, which concomitantly produces 
NADPH. In addition to improved NADPH regenera -
tion, overexpression of the malic enzyme might also 
increase the supply of pyruvate, which subsequently 
could be utilized for the isobutanol formation. This strat-
egy resulted in a 43% increase of isobutanol compared 
to the Ppiso-  5 strain, reaching a final titre of 1.5 g L−1 
(Figure 4B). Interestingly, the newly designed strain 
(Ppiso- 8) also produced less by- products, in particular, 
meso- BDO, lactate and ethanol (Table S3).
Proteomics analysis for evaluation of 
synthetic isobutanol operon
As isobutanol production is not solely dependent on 
the rationally introduced enzymes, but also relies on 
glycolysis for precursor supply and different native 
alcohol dehydrogenases might be involved in the re -
duction of isobutyraldehyde to isobutanol, we set out 
to investigate the protein expression pattern in P.  poly-
myxa at different growth stages. Proteome analysis of 
the Ppiso-  5 in comparison to the parental strain ∆ ldh 
showed that besides KARI, the NADPH-  consuming 
proteins were downregulated, allowing KARI to pull 
the available cellular NADPH towards the isobutanol 
pathway. However, the strong upregulation of KARI 
was not accompanied by the upregulation of NADPH- 
generating enzymes, which might result in NADPH 
exhaustion in the cells. The two major NADPH- 
regenerating enzymes, isocitrate dehydrogenase and 
glucose- 6- phosphate 1- dehydrogenase (G6PD), were 
only upregulated about to 10% (Table S5).
Looking at the enzymes of the isobutanol pathway, 
expression of KDC, KARI and ADH are induced after 
10 h, which explains the effective isobutanol pro -
duction starting around this time point ( Figure 5A). 
The significant increase of KDC and KARI corre -
sponds to the activation of the alsD  promoter, which 
   | 9 of 15
METABOLIC ENGINEERING OF P. POLYMYXA
is activated in the post-  exponential growth phase 
(Renna et al., 1993 ). While KARI has an eightfold 
higher abundance compared to the ∆ ldh, DHAD and 
ADH expression is only upregulated around three -
fold respectively ( Figure 5B; Table S6). This is plau -
sible since in the operon the genes were placed in 
the order of KDC-  KARI-  DHAD-  ADH ( Figure 5C). 
Consequently, the expression levels of genes encod -
ing DHAD and ADH might be lower due to their distal 
position (Lim et al., 2011). While the level of ADH in -
creased over the course of cultivation, the amount of 
DHAD remained relatively constant. Hence, the max -
imum flux that can be sustained by the DHAD activity 
is 10 times less than the preceding reaction catalysed 
by KARI, suggesting that DHAD might be a poten -
tial bottleneck of the pathway ( Figure 5D; Table S7). 
In contrast to ADH, which is part of the fermentative 
pathways, DHAD is part of the branched-  chain amino

metabolism and synthetic isobutanol pathway in Paenibacillus polymyxa . Deletion of glucose-  6- phosphate isomerase ( pgi) would redirect

extract (Bayaraa et al., 2022 ; Brinkmann-  Chen et al., 2013; Gocke et al., 2007; Liu et al., 2013). The flux values were then normalized to the 
lowest relative maximum theoretical flux (DHAD).

induction of adh in the early stationary phase and the 
constitutive expression of dhad .
Effects of the presence and production of 
isobutanol on the proteome of P. polymyxa
To transform P. polymyxa into a bacterial cell factory for 
the production of isobutanol, it is imperative that the 
product of the process is well tolerated by the strain. 
However, in the presence of already low concentration 
(<10 g L−1), isobutanol results in extended lag phases 
and lower final biomass concentrations ( Figure 2D). 
Therefore, we set out to analyse the proteomic re -
sponse of P. polymyxa to isobutanol in order to identify 
the toxicity mechanism and possible engineering strat -
egies to increase the resistance. This study covered 
about 48% of the theoretical proteome (2674 proteins), 
including the heterologous KDC. In addition to the wild 
type, the Δldh strain was also evaluated as this deletion 
was incorporated into most of the isobutanol- producing 
strains generated in this study. Only proteins with sig -
nificant differences ( p < 0.05) between the sample and 
control groups were considered for data interpretation 
and analysis.
The supplementation of isobutanol at low concen -
trations (2 g L−1) resulted in only a few genes that were 
differentially expressed by more than fivefold change 
(Figure 6A,B; Tables S8 and S9). In the wild type, the 
flagella biosynthesis protein (FliP) was among the most 
upregulated genes. Increased flagella formation is as -
sociated with increased motility and in turn chemotaxis, 
which is a general toxicity response of bacteria (Colin 
et al., 2021). A dramatic increase was observed for the 
mannose- specific PTS system component with nearly 
15- fold increase. A recent study identified manY , en -
coding a mannose-  specific importer, among the most 
commonly mutated genes in E. coli grown in the pres -
ence of n - butanol, suggesting a role in general stress 
tolerance (Lennen et al., 2023). Meanwhile, the formate 
efflux transporter ( focA) was upregulated to 17-  fold in 
the Δldh strain in the presence of isobutanol. The efflux 
pump is known to play an important role in bacterial tol-
erance, as it facilitates the removal of toxic substances 
from the cytoplasm (Basler et al., 2018). Although E. coli 
FocA was reported to have a strong preference for for -
mate (Beyer et al., 2013 ), no information is available 
for FocA from P.  polymyxa. Therefore, further investi -
gations are necessary to verify whether it could act on 
short- chain alcohols such as isobutanol.
The implementation of the synthetic operon and 
isobutanol production resulted in a strong metabolic im-
pact, as shown by the proteome comparison of Ppiso- 5 
and the parental strain Δ ldh after 48 h of cultivation. In 
total, 402 proteins were found to be downregulated and 
280 proteins were upregulated in Ppiso-  5 compared 
to the Δ ldh (Figure 6C; Table S10). The enzymes re -
lated to ethanol and formate fermentation, such as 
alcohol dehydrogenases and pyruvate-  formate lyase 
were less expressed, which explains the reduced by- 
product formation of the isobutanol-  producing strain. 
Besides KDC and KARI, proteins related to biofilm 
formation and extracellular matrix substances were 
strongly upregulated. In particular, the Veg protein and 
GDP- L- fucose synthetase were 11-  fold upregulated, 
as well as the UDP-  glucose 6-  dehydrogenase which 
was fivefold more abundant. Biofilm serves multiple 
functions in the microbial community, including pro -
tection against environmental and chemical stressors 
(Balcázar et al., 2015). Hence, the stimulation of biofilm 
formation could be a cellular response to cope with the 
isobutanol presence. Just recently, a fucose-  rich exo-
polysaccharide was reported for P. polymyxa, which un-
derpins increased polysaccharide production (Schilling 
et al., 2022). Furthermore, increased biofilm formation 
in the presence of alcohol was previously reported for 
Bacillus cereus (Yan et al., 2017).
The proteome analysis of the Ppiso- 5 strain showed 
that the metabolism shifted over the different growth 
phases (Figure 6D; Table S11). In the early exponen -
tial phase, proteins affiliated with the glycolysis, TCA 
cycle and PP pathway accounted for 3%, 1% and 0.6% 
of the total proteins respectively. In addition, proteins 
involved in the production of fermentative metabolites 
such as acetate, formate, lactate, ethanol, 2,3-  BDO 
and isobutanol, represented 2.5% of the total protein 
content. During this phase, the cells underwent rapid 
growth and efficient aerobic respiration, as observed 
from the highly upregulated TCA cycle compared to 
the other growth phases. Many enzymes in the TCA 
cycle were downregulated at the end of the exponential 
phase, which indicates a slower cycle rate, as the cells 
shifted from aerobic to microaerobic condition and thus 
to production of fermentation products. Interestingly, 
despite the general decrease of the enzymes in the 
TCA cycle, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) and suc -
cinate dehydrogenase (SDH) were upregulated in the 
later growth phases. These two enzymes catalyse 
redox reactions and generate NADPH and FADH 2 re-
spectively. Accordingly, the quantity of the ribosomal 
proteins decreased when growth slowed down while 
the level of the glycolytic and fermentative enzymes in-
creased (Figure S6).
Furthermore, despite the general increase of the PP 
pathway by two times at the stationary phase compared 
to exponential phase, the amount of G6PD remained 
constant throughout the cultivation. G6PD catalyses 
the first reaction of the PP pathway by the oxidation 
of glucose-  6- phosphate to 6- phosphogluconolactone, 
which generates NADPH. This reaction has been re -
ported to be the rate-  limiting step that directly controls 
the PP pathway flux (Stincone et al., 2015). Moreover, 
the profile of proteins related to the central carbon 
   | 11 of 15

metabolism was highly similar in the late exponential 
and stationary phases. Although we observed that the 
PP pathway was even upregulated by 17% between 
early and late stationary phases, which once again em-
phasized the importance of this pathway for NADPH 
regeneration.
Design of a minimal medium for 
P. polymyxa cultivation
So far P.  polymyxa has been cultivated solely on rich 
media, which is economically costly and thus is unfa -
vourable for large-  scale applications. In this study, we 
systematically performed media optimization towards a 
minimal synthetic medium for P.  polymyxa cultivation. 
First, we evaluated the growth of the Ppiso- 5 strain in rich 
medium (RM), or de Bont minimal medium (Hartmans 
et al., 1989) supplemented with either 0.05 g L−1 yeast 
extract (MM-  YE) or 0.05 g L−1 peptone (MM-  P). The 
strain was passaged directly from MM supplemented 
with 0.05 g L−1 YE and 0.1 g L−1 peptone into the indi -
cated medium without prior adaption in order to also 
inspect possible adaption or lag phases. As expected, 
the best growth was obtained from the RM. However, 
despite a longer lag phase, the strain could also grow 
in MM- YE (biphasic), but not in MM-  P. Since yeast ex-
tract contains a multitude of different compounds, such 
as amino acids and vitamins (Tomé, 2021), we decided 
to further investigate which of these compounds is

essential for P.  polymyxa by supplementing more re -
fined ingredients. No growth was observed from cul -
tivation in minimal medium with the addition of a pure 
amino acid mix (MM-  AA). Interestingly, the strain grew 
particularly well with the supplementation of vitamin B 
mix (MM- VIT) and maintained similar level of isobutanol 
production compared to the RM (Figure S7). Moreover, 
the strain showed a higher growth rate and shorter lag 
phase compared to MM-  YE, and finally even reached 
a similar biomass concentration as in RM ( Figure 7A; 
Table S12). This suggests that one or more compo -
nents of the vitamin B mix promote growth of P. poly-
myxa. Subsequently, we cultivated the strain in MM 
supplemented with each component of vitamin B mix: 
B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B9, B10 or B12 ( Figure 7B). It 
turned out that only pantothenate (B5), biotin (B7) and 
folate (B9) are essential for P. polymyxa to grow in MM. 
Genomic analysis of P. polymyxa revealed that many 
biotin biosynthetic genes are missing from its genome, 
which explains its auxotrophy for this vitamin. On the 
other hand, it was observed that supplementation of 
pantothenate or folate compensated growth even in 
the absence of biotin. It is plausible that these vitamins 
are linked through coenzyme A (CoA) and fatty acid 
biosynthesis, considering that pantothenate is the main 
precursor for CoA synthesis and biotin is the cofactor 
for several fatty acid biosynthetic enzymes (Leonardi 
& Jackowski, 2007; Sirithanakorn & Cronan,  2021). 
Furthermore, pantothenate generation requires 5,10- m
ethylene- tetrahydrofolate, which is a derivative of folate 
(Chassagnole et al., 2003). Finally, the utilization of 
minimal medium would significantly reduce the cost of 
media for P. polymyxa cultivations (Table S13).
CONCLUSION
Paenibacillus polymyxa is a metabolically versatile or -
ganism which renders it a promising unconventional 
prokaryotic host. In this study, we performed the first 
genome engineering for the implementation of a syn -
thetic isobutanol pathway. Different mutants were 
generated by simultaneous integration of the isobu -
tanol pathway and elimination of the native 2,3- BDO in 
P. polymyxa. A combinatorial approach of quantifying 
enzyme activity and proteomic analysis suggested that 
ilvD, which encodes for DHAD, was a main potential 
bottleneck of the synthetic pathway. Furthermore, en -
gineering of the NADPH regeneration through overex -
pression of the malic enzyme improved the product titre 
to 1.5 g L−1 isobutanol.
Proteomic analysis revealed a strong metabolic shift 
of P. polymyxa in response to isobutanol production. 
More than 600 proteins were found to be differentially 
expressed in the isobutanol- producing strain compared 
to the non-  producing strain. Investigation of different 
growth phases of P. polymyxa identified a highly active 
TCA cycle in the early exponential phase, which subse-
quently shifted to upregulated glycolysis, PP pathway 
and fermentative pathways in the late exponential and 
stationary phases. However, an efficient NADPH re -
generation via the PP pathway appeared to be limited 
by the low amount of G6PD enzymes.
Genomic analysis of P. polymyxa revealed that it 
lacks several biotin biosynthetic genes, which causes 
biotin auxotrophy. Through a series of media optimiza -
tion rounds, we found out that supplementation of biotin 
restored the growth of P. polymyxa in minimal medium. 
Interestingly, the addition of pantothenate or folate re -
sulted in a similar effect as biotin. We hypothesized 
that the three vitamins are interconnected through the 
CoA and fatty acid biosynthesis routes, and therefore, 
one component could compensate for the lack of the 
others. Finally, supplementation of vitamin B mix in the 
minimal medium improved the growth and shortened 
the lag phase compared to the addition of biotin, pan -
tothenate and folate individually. The use of a minimal 
medium significantly reduced the media cost and thus
