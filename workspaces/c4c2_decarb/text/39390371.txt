Abstract
Background Cormus domestica (L.) is a monophyletic wild fruit tree belonging to the Rosaceae family, with 
well-documented use in the Mediterranean region. Traditionally, these fruits are harvested and stored for at least 
2 weeks before consumption. During this period, the fruit reaches its well-known and peculiar organoleptic 
and texture characteristics. However, the spread of more profitable fruit tree species, resulted in its progressive 
erosion. In this work we performed proteomic and metabolomic fruit analyses at three times after harvesting, to 
characterise postharvest physiological and molecular changes, it related to nutritional and organoleptic properties at 
consumption.
Results Proteomics and metabolomics analysis were performed on fruits harvested at different time points: freshly 
harvested fruit (T0), fruit two weeks after harvest (T1) and fruit four weeks after harvest (T2). Proteomic analysis 
(Shotgun Proteomic in LC-MS/MS) resulted in 643 proteins identified. Most of the differentially abundant proteins 
between the three phases observed were involved in the softening process, carbohydrate metabolism and stress 
responses. Enzymes, such as xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase, pectin acetylesterase, beta-galactosidase 
and pectinesterase, accumulated during fruit ripening and could explain the pulp breakdown observed in C. 
domestica. At the same time, enzymes abundant in the early stages (T0), such as sucrose synthase and malic enzyme, 
explain the accumulation of sugars and the lowering of acidity during the process. The metabolites extraction from 
C. domestica fruits enabled the identification of 606 statistically significant differentially abundant metabolites. Some 
compounds such as piptamine and resorcinol, well-known for their antimicrobial and antifungal properties, and 
several bioactive compounds such as endocannabinoids, usually described in the leaves, accumulate in C. domestica 
fruit during the post-harvest process.
Conclusions The metabolomic and proteomic profiling of the C. domestica fruit during the postharvest process, 
evaluated in the study, provides a considerable contribution to filling the existing information gap, enabling the

Background
The valorisation of niche plant species linked to terri -
torial cultural heritage strictly depends on the charac -
terisation of their properties to avoid the risk of cultural 
erosion. In fact, these plant species represent essential 
genetic resources for the maintenance of biodiversity 
and ecosystem services they provide. However, entropic 
activities and economically more remunerative intensive 
monocultural agricultural production systems have led to 
the progressive erosion of these resources [1, 2].
The taxonomy of Sorbus historically has been contro -
versial, but molecular phylogenetic analyses have indi -
cated that Sorbus sensu lato  is polyphyletic, but Sorbus 
sensu stricto  and the other five segregated genera, Aria, 
Chamaemespilus, Cormus, Micromeles and Torminalis 
are monophyletic [ 3]. The Service Tree, Cormus domes -
tica ( = Sorbus domestica L.)  (Rosaceae), is a rare and 
uncommon species of wild fruit tree with a fragmented 
low-density population found mainly in southern and 
central Europe. This fruit tree has been known and cul -
tivated since Roman times due to its good resilience and 
ability to grow on several soil types, even those poor in 
nutrients. It needs good sun exposure and a mild temper-
ate climate but tolerates water stress, so it is well adapted 
to the Mediterranean climate. Considered as a forest fruit 
tree, it provides several ecosystem services for biodiver -
sity maintenance and is also used as an ornamental tree 
in urban areas [ 4]. Unfortunately, the natural spread of 
this species has progressively eroded, and cultivation for 
fruit production is now even more limited [ 5]. C. domes-
tica fruits can be distinguished according to whether they 
are pear- or apple-shaped. These fruits with distinctive 
flavours can be used for various culinary and medicinal 
purposes [ 6]. Ripe C. domestica  fruits suitable for con -
sumption are brown or yellowish coloured and ripen in 
September-October. The average weight of a C. domes -
tica fruit is 25 g and its diameter can reach a maximum 
of 4.5 cm [7–9].
The Rosaceae family contains several fruits of great eco-
nomic value, such as apple, pear, cherry, peach and many 
others, and for these fruits, it is possible to find various 
multi-omics analyses (metabolomics, transcriptomics 
and proteomics) which characterise them from a physio -
logical, nutritional and organoleptic point of view during 
the ripening and post-harvest phases [ 10–14]. The physi-
ological process of ripening involves drastic changes like 
alteration in colour, alteration in composition and quan -
tity of sugars, organic and volatile acids that modify fla -
vour and aroma, and alteration to the cell walls that make 
the fruit softer [ 15, 16]. Although the ripening process 
generally makes fruits more palatable, the C. domestica  
fruit flesh remains astringent and tough when harvested. 
In fact, the fruits are only consumed several weeks after 
harvest in a state of incipient decay, when the flesh finally 
reaches a very soft texture and the flavour becomes sweet 
and pleasant [ 17]. At this stage, the fruit can be eaten as 
it is or used to make jam, juice, fruit wine, or cider [ 18]. 
Although the C. domestica  fruits are rich in nutrients 
and suitable for processing, they are currently underval -
ued or even unknown by consumers and will need to be 
enhanced to compete with the wide range of fruits on the 
market [8, 19]. To date, there are few manuscripts in the 
scientific literature analysing the phytochemical changes 
of this peculiar fruit during the post-harvest phases. 
Multi-omics data collection and integration to follow a 
physiological process is an approach that provides a high 
degree of insight, especially when applied to species that 
have so far been little studied and need to be enhanced 
[10, 20–22]. Therefore, given the physiological process 
that precedes the consumption of this fruit, and the lack 
of information regarding its proteome and metabolome, 
the aim of this work is to fill these gaps to characterise 
and valorise this ancient fruit.
Results
Cormus Domestica (L.) post-harvest proteomic profiles
As shown in Fig.  1A and B, proteomic analysis allowed 
us to identify 643 protein species (Supplementary File1), 
of which 12% were present exclusively at the time of har -
vest (T0), 14% shared exclusively between T0 and T1, 
and most (71.6%) were common to the three maturation 
stages observed (T0, T1, T2). Interestingly, the extraction 
yield, and the number of identified proteins decreased at 
later stages, from T0 to T2 (Table 1).
Statistical analysis, performed by means of Dunn test 
(p < 0.05), allowed us to filter the original data set to 
160 differentially abundant proteins between the three 
maturation stages, i.e. between the freshly harvested C. 
domestica fruit (T0), after 2 weeks (T1) and 4 weeks (T2) 
of post-harvest ripening (Table  1, Supplementary File 
2). To obtain an overview of the functional classes they 
belong, proteins were sorted according to GO classes 
for Molecular Function (Supplementary Fig. 1), Biologi -
cal Process (Supplementary Fig. 2) and Cellular Compo -
nent (Supplementary Fig. 3) via Mercator4 V2.0 ( https://
mapman.gabipd.org/app/mercator) [23] and are depicted 
in Fig.  1B. Most proteins were involved in carbohy -
drates, amino acids, protein and lipid metabolism, cell 
molecular and phytochemical characterisation of this erosion-endangered fruit. Data show biochemical changes that 
transform the harvested fruit into palatable consumable product.

corresponding to enzymes involved in cell wall modi -

(A0A0B5W3U1, A0A0M3TB64, A0A5N5FU34) were 
most abundant in T1 stage. The enzyme malate dehy -
drogenase (A0A498I601, A0A498I8M1, A0A540KIX2) 
was consistently abundant in the three observed stages, 
whereas fructose-bisphosphate aldolase (A0A5N5HXN8,

A0A540KUY8) was more abundant ( p < 0.05) in T2 and 
showed the opposite trend to glucose-1-phosphate ade -
nylyltransferase (A0A498HC29) and glucose-6-phos -
phate 1-dehydrogenase (A0A5N5GTK5). Regarding 
the decrease in acidity, several malate dehydrogenases 
(A0A498I601, A0A498I8M1, A0A540KIX2) were iden -
tified with a constant or significantly increasing trend 
during the ripening process. In addition, citrate synthase 
(A0A165FX72) was more abundant in the early stages 
of post-harvest process T1 > T0, being non-detected 
in T2 (Supplementary File1). Furthermore, proteins 
with enzymatic activity represented the most abundant 
class, comprising 181 accessions. The intense enzymatic 
activity, evident when observing the ripening process 
of C. domestica , involved all the enzyme macroclasses 
(Fig.  1C) with the following abundances: 26% oxidore -
ductases, 22% transferases, 19% hydrolases, 13% lyases, 
9% isomers, 5% ligases, and 2% translocases. In addi -
tion to several enzymes involved in scavenging reactive 
oxygen species (ROS), proteomic analysis revealed the 
abundance of several Heat Shock Proteins. Also, some 
peculiar proteins related to the physiological stress 
induced by the ripening process in the fruit have been 
identified. It was the case of abscisic stress ripening pro -
tein (A0A498JY74), that accumulated in T2, remorin 
(A0A498JK49) that showed a peak in abundance in T1, 
and spermidine synthase (A0A5N5HGV6) that did not 
change in abundance among the three stages.
The PCA analysis (Fig.  2) clearly showed the degree of 
homogeneity of the biological replicates and the good 
separation of the samples at their maturation stages. It 
also showed that the main multivariate difference was 
observed between T0 and T2, in agreement with the uni -
variate test (Dunn test). The top fifty proteins that con -
tribute most to the variability among stages bases on 
cos2, (Supplementary Fig.  4) were identified, showing 
how certain proteins of significant relevance to the physi-
ological process of ripening were characteristic variables 
across different phases. For example, beta-galactosidase 
(A0A498KCW4) and citrate synthase (A0A498HN15) 
were characteristic of T0, pectinesterase (A0A5N5FU34) 
of T1, and lipoxygenase (S4ULE0) and mandelonitrile 
lyase (A0A498KFV8) of T2.

Cormus Domestica (L.) metabolomic profiles at post-
harvest ripening
Initial analyses carried out on the fruit samples under 
analysis (T0, T1 and T2) showed a marked reduction in 
starch content from an average of 267 mg/g in the freshly 
harvested fruit (T0) to 48 mg/g in the fruit at the end of 
the ripening process (T2), and an increase in sugar levels 
from an average of 50  mg/g to 248  mg/g during ripen -
ing. In contrast, no significant change in chlorophyll and 
carotenoid content was observed (Supplementary File 3, 
Fig. 3).
Metabolomic analysis resulted in 4377 features 
resolved in positive ionisation mode, of which 2334 had 
putative annotation (Supplementary File 4). A statisti -
cal analysis was performed on the 1752 variables thus 
selected (consistency 0.25), obtaining 606 statistically 
significant differentially abundant metabolites. All the 
metabolites were classified using ClassyFire ( http://
classyfire.wishartlab.com/). As shown in Fig.  3C, the 
metabolic profile of the three ripening stages underwent 
consistent alterations, and the profile of the intermedi -
ate stage (T1), had more Alkaloids and Organoheterocy -
clic compounds and less Benzenoids than the under and 
over-ripened stages (Supplementary File 4). Figure  3D 
shows a Venn diagram where it can be seen that of the 
metabolites identified, 675 were common to the three 
ripening stages (T0, T1, T2), 94 shared between T0 and 
T1, 141 between T1 and T2 and 119 between T2 and T1. 
It is also possible to observe a focus on the metabolites 
unique to only one of the three post-harvest phases, and 
which classes were the most represented. T1 has a higher 
percentage of metabolites belonging to the Organohet -
erocyclic compounds and Organic acids class than the 
T0 and T2 phases. As far as molecules of a lipidic nature 
are concerned, including terpenoids, although these were 
unique compounds peculiar to each class, the trend in 
class abundance remained almost constant at T0 and T1 
and then decreased at T2 (Supplementary File 4).
A principal component analysis (PCA) showed a good 
clustering of the replicates and separation of the stages 
(Fig. 3B). Table 2 shows the main metabolites character -
ising the T1 stage. The main metabolites at T0 and T2 
stages, in which the fruit is not routinely consumed, are 
presented in Supplementary Tables 1, and prominent 
among them were Chlorogenic acid, 4-Coumarylalco -
hol, Caffeic acid, Citric acid and Pipecolic acid. These 
were filtered maintaining a variable consistency of 0.25. 
Furthermore, a PCA with the 50 top-score variables 
(based on cos2) is shown in Supplementary Fig. 5.
As the results showed, the class of organoheterocyclic 
compounds was the most represented in the T1 stage. 
To this superclass belonged certain metabolites pres -
ent exclusively at one of the three post-harvests ripening 
stages under analysis. For example, freshly harvested (T0) 
fruit had compounds such as patulin and nicotinamide 
that were not found in the other stages. The usual eating 
stage, the richest in these metabolites, had exclusive com-
pounds such as furanone, aspilactonol C, pantolactone, 
kinetin and carbazoles. The last observed stage (T2) had 
unique compounds such as piperidine and agnestin B. In 
the case of metabolites belonging to the class of carbohy -
drates and carbohydrate conjugates, an increased abun -
dance was also observed at the T1 stage. In fact, while for 
some compounds, such as glucose and maltose, an accu -
mulation trend was observed during the process, others 
had a Gaussian trend, or were present exclusively at the 
consumption stage (T1) such as apiitol or biflorin. The 
accumulation of these sugars was consistent with respect 
to starch splitting, as confirmed by the results shown 
above. Among the metabolites belonging to the class 
of lipids and lipid-like molecules, the most abundant in 
our samples were oleamide and hexadecanamide. To the 
same class of metabolites belonged several terpenoids 
found in all post-harvest ripening phases analysed (T2) 
such as maslinic acid and p-cymene. In addition, several 
compounds that contribute to the fruit’s aromatic notes, 
such as citral, limonene, pulegone and camphor, although 
present at all three ripening stages analysed, reached a 
peak in abundance at the T1 stage, in which the aromatic 
bouquet was enriched with compounds such as borneol 
and capsidiol. An interesting result was the presence of 
endocannabinoids (2-Arachidonoyl glycerol) most abun -
dant at the fruit harvest stage (T0). The class of lysergic 
acids and derivatives belonged several compounds that 
exhibited different abundance trends. Among these, the 
metabolites most representative of the T0 stage were 
chlorogenic acid and caffeic acid, whose values then 
decreased with ripening. The T1 stage was character -
ized by the abundance of citric acid, pipecolic acid, sorbic 
acid, and adipic acid and the exclusive presence of com -
pounds such as almecillin and mirubactin. In contrast, 
some of the metabolites present in all stages of ripen -
ing of the C. domestica  fruit, but most abundant in T2, 
were acetoacetic acid, asperterreusine A, salicylic acid 
(See figure on previous page.)

and palmitic acid. Another class of particular interest in 
the delineation of the metabolomic profile of the fruit is 
that of the phenolics and polyketides, to which belonged 
several well-known phytocompounds such as couma -
rin, fustin, and taxifolin, whose concentration decreased 
appreciably in the observed phases (T0 > T1 > T2), and 
others with peaks of abundance at T1 such as Quercetin-
3β-D-glucoside and trifolin.
Discussion
Although much information is available for other fruits 
belonging to the Rosaceae family regarding physiological 
and biochemical changes along the ripening process [ 13], 
little is known about postharvest changes in Cormus 
domestica (L) fruit. This small, ancient fruit, widespread 
in the Mediterranean, and closely connected to tradi -
tional and rural culture, is unfortunately at serious risk of 
cultural erosion due to the wider spread of intensive cul -
tivation of fruits with wider economic value such as the 
apple or pear [ 24]. The ripening process is a genetically 
programmed, irreversible and highly regulated process 
involving changes in the fruit structure, organoleptic 
properties and chemical composition. Generally, the 
combination of physiological changes makes the fruit 
more palatable for consumption. The main alterations of 
a ripening fruit involve its colour, texture, flavour and 
aroma. The colour change is mainly due to the chloro -
plasts turning into chromoplasts and the accumulation of 
neo-synthesised pigments. The pulp softening is due to 
the alteration of the cell walls, the sweetening to the 
accumulation of sugars and the reduction of sour compo-
nents, and the production of various metabolites contrib-
ute to the attainment of aroma and flavour [ 15, 25–27]. 
Traditionally, C. domestica  fruits are harvested fully 
developed, and eaten after a ripening period in a cool, 
dry and airy room in the dark for about a month until 
they reach a soft consistency. Only then will the fruit 
have lost its acrid, woody flavour and become very sweet 
and juicy. At this stage it is consumed as it is or used for 
the production of jams, jellies or spirits [ 5, 28]. In this 
work, we collected proteomics and metabolomics data at 
different stages of post-harvest ripening in order to delin-
eate the major physiological changes in the fruit of C. 
domestica, for which few data were available in the litera-
ture. The pronounced colour change, usually observed 
during the fruit ripening [ 29] was not observed in C. 
domestica fruit, which, as shown by analyses of photo -
synthetic pigment content and in the sample photos 
shown, did not accumulate carotenoids during ripening, 
but rather took on a brownish colour mainly due to the 
natural oxidative processes involving the fruit in post-
harvest ripening [ 30]. The phenomenon of pulp brown -
ing was due, as evidenced by metabolomic analysis, to 
the accumulation of chlorogenic acid and its subsequent 
oxidation by polyphenol oxidase (PPO). This enzyme, 
which was found to be constant by proteomics analysis in 
the post-harvest ripening stages, catalyses the oxidation 
of phenols to quinones and the reduction of oxygen to 
water, with concomitant protein complexation and the 
formation of melanin pigments that give this ripe fruit its

characteristic colour [ 31]. In addition to colour change, 
ripening includes an essential softening process due to 
hydrolytic processes resulting in the breakdown of cell 
wall polymers (cellulose, hemicelluloses and pectins) by 
wall enzymes that are essential for softening the fruit and 
improving its chewability [16, 32]. One of the most abun-
dant functional classes revealed by our proteomic analy -
sis is that involved in cell wall changes. In fact, the results 
highlighted that the abundance of enzymes such as 
b-galactosidase and pectinesterase acting on the pectic 
component of the cell wall, which is mainly responsible 
for the hardness of unripe fruits. Specifically, the role of 
β-galactosidase (β-Gal) in the apple ripening process has 
been studied and its involvement in modulating the firm-
ness and the pectin content has been confirmed and 
appears to be induced by ethylene [ 33, 34]. These 
enzymes, like others that act on hemicelluloses (XET) 
and non-enzymatic proteins such as expansin, accumu -
lated abundantly in the fruit of C. domestica  already in 
the early stages of post-harvest ripening. The enzymatic 
activity of the cell wall in the fruit of C. domestica made it 
particularly soft in consistency, but this, together with 
the accumulation of sugars and oxidative processes, sig -
nificantly reduced its shelf life [ 16]. Reactive oxygen spe -
cies (ROS) are inevitably produced by metabolic 
pathways activated during the fruit ripening process. The 
ROS accumulation causes oxidative damage by reacting 
with nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. Simultaneously 
with their production and accumulation in plant tissue, 
plants activate the recovery system and produce enzy -
matic and non-enzymatic antioxidants such as superox -
ide dismutase (SOD), glutathione reductase (GR), 
peroxidase (POX), catalase (CAT), ascorbate peroxidase 
(APX), monodehydroascorbate reductase (MDHAR), 
dehydroascorbate reductase (DHAR), and antioxidant 
compounds such as ascorbate, glutathione, flavonoids, 
and tocopherols, which were found to accumulate in the 
C. domestica  fruits under analysis and as in other fruits 
belonging to the Rosaceae family [ 13, 35]. The accumula-
tion of antioxidant enzymes and soluble antioxidant 
compounds such as flavonoids has also been observed in 
our samples. In particular, the accumulation of quercetin-
3β-D-glucoside, taxifolin, fustin and coumarin increased 
the nutraceutical power of this ancient fruit [ 36, 37], 
which has a general anti-inflammatory effect and can 
modulate the lipid peroxidation involved in several dis -
eases such as atherogenesis, thrombosis, and carcinogen -
esis, especially at the habitual stage of fruit consumption 
to decay then 4 weeks after harvest. Ripening is a physio -
logical process, highly regulated with pathways that are 
still not clearly defined and understood, and which inter -
connects at several levels with abiotic stress response 
pathways [ 25, 38]. The post-harvest ripening process 
induced in C. domestica  fruit the accumulation of 
Abscisic stress ripening protein (ASR), a protein induced 
by ABA, stress and ripening. Several studies have shown 
that ASR gene expression varies between species, organs 
and conditions, and appears to be involved in fruit ripen -
ing, although its mechanism of action is not yet well 
understood [ 39, 40]. Similarly, Remorin, a protein 
involved in the regulation of several physiological pro -
cesses, showed a peak in abundance two weeks after C. 
domestica fruit harvest, and its contribution in ripening 
process regulation is known from the literature [ 41]. 
Other proteins involved in stress and energy metabolism 
such as Small Heat Shock Proteins (sHSPs) were found to 
be abundant in the ripening of C. domestica  fruit. These 
chaperones have been found in several proteomics stud -
ies related to abiotic and developmental stress response 
that have been characterised in ripening fruits [ 34, 42]. 
During ripening, a complex regulatory mechanism shifts 
metabolism from starch synthesis to starch degradation 
and the accumulation of soluble sugars, mainly sucrose. 
This conversion is responsible not only for fruit sweet -
ness, but also for providing energy for the metabolic pro -
cesses taking place during ripening [ 43, 44]. As expected 
and evidenced by both metabolomic and proteomic anal -
yses, also in the post-harvest ripening process of the C. 
domestica fruit followed in this experiment, a marked 
conversion of starch to soluble sugars was observed and 
the levels of the enzyme sucrose synthase remained high 
until the end of the ripening process. The main soluble 
sugars in fruits such as apples or pears are sucrose, fruc -
tose and glucose, which were also particularly abundant 
in the C. domestica  stage of consumption; as were some 
sugar alcohols such as sorbitol [ 11]. Furthermore, meta -
bolic analysis confirmed the gradual but significant accu -
mulation of maltose and glucose as ripening progressed. 
In addition to sweetness, another important parameter 
that determines the organoleptic characteristics of the 
fruit is acidity, mainly due to the presence of organic 
acids accumulated in the vacuole [ 45]. In apples and 
pears, the main ones are malic acid and citric acid, and 
the lowering of the degree of acidity is mainly due to the 
investment of these organic acids in the respiration pro -
cess and the production of secondary metabolites [ 32]. 
Citrate synthase and Malic enzyme accumulated in the C. 
domestica fruit during ripening, causing a reduction in 
malate and contributing to the decline in fruit acidity. 
Several peculiar metabolites were found to be particu -
larly abundant in our samples, especially in the abiutal 
consumption stage. Among these piptamine and resor -
cinol, are well-knownfor their antimicrobial and antifun -
gal properties [16]. In addition to firmness and sweetness, 
another important parameter characterising a ripe fruit 
is its olfactory characteristics. These depend on hundreds 
of volatile compounds that are produced differentially 
during the various stages of ripening and are responsible 
Page 9 of 14
Tartaglia et al. BMC Plant Biology           (2024) 24:945 
for aroma production. Volatile compounds vary widely in 
different fruits and are generally aldehydes, alcohols, 
ketones, lactones, esters and terpenoids [ 46]. Because 
aroma is closely associated with phytochemicals that 
make fruit healthy, the health benefits for the consumer 
are not limited to the satisfying experience for the senses 
(taste and smell). Metabolomic analysis has allowed us to 
identify several compounds particularly abundant in the 
preferential eating stage of the C. domestica  fruit that 
together provided the fruit with a peculiar aroma. Citral 
and limonene, in addition to inducing the jasmonic acid 
pathway to endow fruit with resistance to biotic stresses, 
confered fresh and citrus notes [ 47]. The abundance of 
camphor, pulegone and borneol added intense minty 
notes, while benzophenone soft, fresh notes with touches 
of fruit and flowers. Typically these compounds not only 
impart the final aroma to the fruit but also have antimi -
crobial and anti-inflammatory properties [15, 48, 49].
Conclusions
Cormus domestica  is an ancient fruit tree, widespread 
in the Mediterranean area, closely linked to traditional 
culture and at serious risk of cultural erosion. This work 
analysed the post-harvest ripening process of the Cor-
mus domestica  fruit through a multi-omics approach, 
integrating the proteomic and metabolomic approaches 
to characterise both the biological process and the pecu -
liarities of this ancient fruit and fills an information gap. 
The multiomics approach used revealed the involvement 
of several enzymes in C. domestica fruit that partici -
pate in cell wall softening such as xyloglucan endotrans -
glucosylase/hydrolase, expansin, pectin acetylesterase, 
beta-galactosidase and pectinesterase. In response to 
reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during ripen -
ing, C. domestica  activates a robust antioxidant defense 
system. Enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), 
glutathione reductase (GR), and peroxidase (POX) work 
alongside non-enzymatic antioxidants like flavonoids 
(quercetin-3β-D-glucoside, taxifolin, fustin, and couma -
rin) to mitigate oxidative damage. These antioxidants not 
only protect the fruit but also enhance its nutraceutical 
value. However, especially in the final stage, close to the 
fruit’s decay, a marked browning of the pulp appears to 
be associated with the accumulation of chlorogenic acid 
and its subsequent oxidation by polyphenol oxidase. 
While the particularly sweet taste of this ancient fruit is 
mainly due to the rapid conversion of starch into simple 
sugars and the reduction of the acid component due to 
the accumulation of citrate synthase and malic enzyme 
during ripening and the reduction of malate. The aroma, 
appreciated and recognised by consumers, seems to 
depend on a broad spectrum of compounds such as cit -
ral, limonene, camphor, pulegone and borneol, which 
in addition have antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory 
properties. The latter were of particular interest because, 
in addition to characterising the aromatic bouquet of 
the fruit under analysis, they also lay the foundations to 
establish the nutraceutical properties already known and 
inherited from in rural popular culture.
Methods
Plant material
The fruits of Cormus domestica  (L.) were collected in 
Campania, Italy in September 2021 from three differ -
ent trees located in the same area with slightly alkaline, 
sandy and well drained soils (Fig.  4). The voucher speci -
mens (PAL-22824) were deposited at the Herbarium 
Mediterraneum Panormitanum of the botanical garden 
of the University of Palermo. Samples were identified 
by Professor Carmine Guarino using the dichotomous 
key found in Flora d’Italia [ 50] and performed, after the 
species identification, nomenclatural correction of syn -
onyms through the digital resources of the Kew Botani -
cal Garden ( http://www.plantsoftheworldonline.org/). 
The climate in this area is typically Mediterranean, with 
average minimum winter temperatures of 8 °C and 24 °C 
in summer and average annual rainfall of around 900 mm 
[51]. The harvested fruits (stage T0) were transported to 
the laboratory where the traditional post-harvest ripen -
ing procedure for these fruits was applied, which involves 
staying in a ventilated, cool and dry place in the dark for 
a period of about 2 weeks (stage T1). Ripening contin -
ued for a further 2 weeks until the fruit had completely 
turned brown (stage T2).
Proteomics analysis
Protein extraction and digestion
Three fruits for each stage considered (T0-T1-T2) were 
washed in deionised water, freeze-dried, and pulverised 
in liquid nitrogen to extract proteins separately from 
three independent biological replicates. For each sample 
0.2 gram of pulverised material was used for total pro -
tein extraction with a modified protocol of the classical 
TCA/Acetone-Phenol extraction [ 52]. After precipita -
tion in 5 volumes of ammonium acetate in methanol 
and three washes with cold acetone (3  ml), the pellet 
was dried under vacuum and solubilised in 100  µl of 
a solution containing 7 M urea, 2 M thiourea, 4% (w/v) 
3-[(3-cholamidopropyl)dimethylammonio]-1-propane -
sulfonate (CHAPS), 0.5% (w/v) Triton X-100, and 100 
mM DTT) and centrifuged to remove insoluble mate -
rial (12,000  g 3min 4  °C). Using the Bradford method 
and bovine serum albumin as a standard, the pro -
tein concentration obtained was then estimated [ 53]. 
The protein extract (80  µg) was subjected to sodium 
dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 
(SDS-PAGE) in a Mini-PROTEAN cell (8.6 × 6.7  cm; 
Bio-Rad) using 12% polyacrylamide gel and voltage of

80  V. The electrophoresis was stopped when the bro -
mophenol blue had advanced 0.5  cm into the resolving 
gel. The gel was then stained with Coomassie Brilliant 
Blue R-250 and bleached overnight in 30% methanol 
and 10% acetic acid in water. The unique band obtained 
from each sample was cut out with a scalpel into por -
tions of size < 1 mm 3 and transferred individually into 
1.5 ml tubes for digestion with 12.5 ng µL -1 sequential 
grade trypsin from Promega (Madison, WI, USA), fol -
lowing the detailed parameters described by Castillejo et 
al. [54].The gel bands were destained by incubating them 
twice for 30 min in a solution containing 200 mM ammo-
nium bicarbonate in 40% acetonitrile at 37 °C. Afterward, 
they underwent three cycles of dehydration/rehydration 
using pure acetonitrile and 25 mM ammonium bicar -
bonate in 40% acetonitrile, respectively, followed by air-
drying at room temperature for 10  min. Subsequently, 
20 µL of trypsin, at a concentration of 12.5 ng µL − 1 in 
25 mM ammonium bicarbonate, was added to the dried 
gel pieces, and digestion proceeded at 37 °C for 12 h. The 
digestion process was terminated, and peptides were 
extracted from the gel plugs by adding 10 µL of 1% (v/v) 
trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and incubating for 15 min. The 
eluent produced after the digestion is purified using C18, 
this process of desalting peptides involves elution with 
70% acetonitrile.
Shotgun proteomic analysis
Samples were acidified with 0.5% Trifluoroacetic acid. 
Desalting and concentration step was performed with 
ZipTip C18 (Millipore) and the digested samples were 
finally Speedvac dried (200 ng per sample). LC-TIMS-
MS/MS was carried out using a nanoElute nanoflow 
ultrahigh-pressure LC system (Bruker Daltonics, Bre -
men, Germany) coupled to a timsTOF Pro 2 mass spec -
trometer, equipped with a CaptiveSpray nanoelectrospray 
ion source (Bruker Daltonics). 200 ng of peptide digest 
was loaded onto a Bruker FIFTEEN C18 capillary col -
umn (15 cm length, 75 μm ID, 1.9 μm particle size, 120 Å 
pore size; Bruker Daltonics). Peptides were separated at 
30 °C using a 20 min gradient at a flow rate of 300 nL/min 
(mobile phase A (MPA): 0.1% FA; mobile phase B (MPB): 
0.1% FA in acetonitrile). A step gradient from 0 to 35% 
MPB was applied over 13  min, followed by a 35 to 90% 
MPB step of 13 to 15 min, and finished with a 90% MPB 
wash for an additional 5 min for a further time. The total 
run time was of 20 min per analysis, timsTOF Pro 2 was 
run in DIA-PASEF mode. Mass spectra for MS and MS/
MS scans were recorded between 100 and 1700 m/z. Ion 
mobility resolution was set to 0.85–1.30 V s/cm2 over a 
ramp time of 100 ms. Data-dependent acquisition was 
performed using 4 PASEF MS/MS scans per cycle with 
a duty cycle close to 100%. A polygonal filter was applied 
on the m/z space and ion mobility, to exclude low m/z, 
mainly single-charged ions from the selection of PASEF 
precursors. An active exclusion time of 0.4  min was 
applied to precursors that reached 20,000 intensity units. 
The collision energy was increased stepwise as a function 
of the ion mobility ramp, from 27 to 45 eV.
Protein identification and quantitation
The parameters applied were set as follows: precursor 
mass tolerance 10 ppm, fragment ion mass tolerance 
0.1 Da, charge state > + 2, false discovery rate (FDR) 1%. 
Proteins were classified according to the law of parsi -
mony. The degree of confidence in protein identification 
was obtained by setting at least 2 matching peptides, a 
minimum score of 2 and a sequence coverage mostly 
above 9.5% [ 55]. Raw data was analyzed in Spectro -
naut (see 15.1.210713.50606 – Rubin) (Biognosys). The 
reference library is acquired from UniProt (uniprot-
maleae_29-2022.11.08-12.51.25.04–157351 entries). The 
directDIA algorithm was used for raw data analysis and 
library generation was created with the Pulsar search 
algorithm using the database itself. All settings were set 
to default (BGS factory settings). To account for post-
translational modifications and chemical labelling, the 
following adjustments were used: carbamidomethylation 
of cysteine residues was set as fixed modification, methi -
onine oxidation and acetylation (N-terminal protein) 
were set as variable modification.
Metabolomics analysis
Metabolites extraction
For metabolite extraction, three replicates were taken for 
each ripening stage considered (T0-T1-T2). Fruits were 
washed in deionised water, freeze-dried and pulverised 
in liquid nitrogen. Metabolites were then extracted from 
30  mg of sample using 600 uL of cold ethanol: water 
(4:1) extraction solution while stirring for 10 s. The mix -
ture was sonicated (40 kHZ for 10 min) and centrifuged 
(20,000 g, 4 °C, 4 min), the supernatant thus obtained was 
transferred to a new tube and the extraction was repeated 
on the pellet with a further 600 uL of ethanol: water (4:1).
Total sugar, phenolic compounds, free amino acids, 
flavonoids and photosynthetic pigments content analysis
Extracts obtained from the samples (in three biological 
replicates) were used to assess the content of total sug -
ars, phenolic compounds, free amino acids, flavonoids 
and photosynthetic pigments, according to classic pro -
tocols [ 56]. The 3,5-dinitrosalicylic acid (DNS), Folin-
Ciocalteu and ninhydrin methods were used to quantify 
the total sugar, phenolics and amino acid content, respec-
tively; and glucose, chlorogenic acid and glycine as refer -
ence standards. Absorbance was measured at 570 nm for 
sugars and amino acids and at 765 nm for phenols. The 
photosynthetic pigments, (chlorophylls and carotenoids) 
Page 12 of 14
Tartaglia et al. BMC Plant Biology           (2024) 24:945 
were evaluated by diluting the extract 1:2 in 80% ethanol 
and reading the absorbances at 663, 647, 537 and 470 nm. 
All readings were taken with a Thermo Scientific Evolu -
tion 201 UV-Visible spectrophotometer.
Metabolite identification and quantification using LC–
Orbitrap MS analysis
The extract obtained from each sample was dried under 
vacuum at 30  °C (Speedvac, Eppendorf Vacuum Con -
centrator Plus/5301, Eppendorf, Leicestershire, UK). 
The extracts thus obtained were reconstituted in 0.5 mL 
of 50% methanol containing 0.1% of formic acid, centri -
fuged (20,000  g, 10  min, RT), filtered through 0.22  μm 
PTPE membranes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Courta -
boeuf, France) and then filtered through 0.22  μm PTPE 
membranes (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Courtaboeuf, 
France). The filtrate was collected in 1.5 mL LC/MS certi-
fied sample vials.
All analysis were performed using a Thermo Sci -
entific liquid chromatography system consisting of a 
binary UHPLC Dionex Ultimate 3000 RS, connected to 
a quadrupole-orbitrap Q Exactive hybrid mass spec -
trometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany), 
which was equipped with a heated-electrospray ioniza -
tion probe (HESI-II). Chromatographic separations were 
performed using an Acquity UPLC BEH C18 column 
(2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 μm) (Waters). The column was main -
tained at 40  °C and eluted under the following condi -
tions: 5% B for 1 min, linear gradient from 5 to 100% in 
solvent B for 9  min, isocratic at 100% B for 2  min, and 
return to initial conditions, 5% B for 3 min. A flow rate 
of 0.5 mL/min was used. Eluent A was 0.1% formic acid 
in water and eluent B was 0.1% formic acid in methanol. 
Injection volume was 5  µl.MS detection was performed 
using a quadrupole hybrid mass spectrometer Orbitrap 
Q Exactive (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany) 
equipped with a heated electrospray ionisation source 
(HESI). HESI source parameters in positive mode were 
spray voltage, 3.5  kV; S-lens RF level, 50; capillary tem -
perature, 320 °C; sheath and auxiliary gas flow, 60 and 25, 
respectively (arbitrary units); and probe heater tempera -
ture, 400 ºC. Instrument control and data acquisition was 
carried out using Xcalibur v.4.3 software. Spectral data 
were acquired in full scan (FS) at a resolution of 70,000 
(full-width half-maximum, FWHM at m/z 200) for MS1 
and a data dependent acquisition MS2 method was 
acquired at resolution 70,000 and 17,500 (FWHM at m/z 
200) for Full Scan and Product Ion Scan, respectively, 
fragmenting the five most abundant precursor ions per 
MS scan (Top5). Full Scan MS and data dependent acqui-
sition MS2 methods were acquired in positive mode and 
mass range used for both experiments was 70–1,050 m/z. 
Three biological replicates of each ripening stage and 
three of the quality control (QC) mixture were analysed. 
QC samples were prepared using equal volumes of all 
samples and injected after every third sample to ensure 
continuous quality and promote data confidence. In addi-
tion, the QC samples were analysed in a data-dependent 
manner (dd-MS2/dd-SIM).
The acquired data were exported from Xcalibur soft -
ware and were deposited in https://doi.org/10.21228/
M83F09. Data treatment, alignment (with a maximum 
shift of 0.1  min and a mass tolerance of 5 ppm), peak 
selection, deconvolution, normalization and annota -
tion were performed using Compound Discoverer v3.1 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific, Bremen, Germany). A rela -
tive comparison among the areas of the chromatographic 
peaks of the MS1 precursor was employed in the com -
pound quantification step. The hypothetical chemical 
formula for each feature was predicted, and the metab -
olite annotation was developed using a ddMS2 simi -
larity search preferably (and formula or exact mass) in 
mzCloud and ChemSpider. Finally, using InChIKey codes 
for each putatively annoted compound, we classified 
them into chemical families (Superclass, class and sub -
class) using ClassyFire ( https://cfb.fiehnlab.ucdavis.edu/ 
) [57].
Data processing and statistical analysis
To deal with missing values (which can affect multivari -
ate statistics) only the ‘‘consistent spots’’ (which were 
those present in the three sample type) were considered, 
according to [58, 59]. For the statistical analysis of the 
proteomics data, first the normal distribution of data was 
checked by the Shapiro-Wilk test. Some variables vio -
late normality, so a Kruskal-Wallis non-parametric test 
was used to verify if there were differences among the 
groups (ripening stages). In order to determine which 
groups were different from others, post-hoc Dunn test 
was conducted. In the R environment (R Core Team, 
2018; https://www.R-project.org/), a principal compo -
nent analysis (PCA) two-dimensional biplot illustrating 
relationships between experimental samples and protein 
spots was created to illustrate the protein pattern. When 
working with multivariate data sets, the biplot graphi -
cal representation is useful to show and explain the rela -
tionships between variables and observations, which are 
represented as dots and rays, respectively. The variables 
(proteins) are represented by rays, and the lengths of 
the rays are directly proportional to the variance of the 
matching protein present in the two components that are 
being shown [ 58]. The link between two vectors repre -
sents the distance from each other.
For the metabolites, three biological replicates were 
used for all processing and statistical procedures in the 
environment RStudio 2023.09.1 + 494 running under R 
v4.3.1. Firstly, neutral masses were evaluated to avoid 
duplicities while retaining the most intense peaks, 
Page 13 of 14
Tartaglia et al. BMC Plant Biology           (2024) 24:945 
quantification data matrix was abundance balanced by 
AvgIntensity method, then processed using Random 
Forest algorithm (with a threshold of 0.35) and filtered 
based on consistency with a threshold of 0.5 using pRo -
cessomics package (available on web direction: https://
github.com/Valledor/pRocessomics.wiki.git). Principal 
Component Analysis with all samples and annotated 
matrix was performed. To determine which metabolites 
were characteristic of each maturation stage, we per -
formed (1) Venn diagram, (2) Kruskal-Wallis non-para -
metric test and (3) calculation of fold-changes between 
stages with respect to T0. Regarding starch, sugars, phe -
nolic compounds, free amino acids, flavonoids and pho -
tosynthetic pigments the Shapiro-Wilk test did not show 
a significant departure from normality, hence a para -
metric test (ANOVA with Tukey post-hoc comparison, 
p < 0.05) was used to verify whether they significantly 
change during ripening.
