Abstract 
Efficient regeneration of NADPH can be a limiting factor for anabolic processes  
in engineered microbial cells. We tested the ability of four distinct Pyruvate- 
Oxaloacetate-Malate “POM” cycles composed of Saccharomyces cerevisiae pyruvate 
carboxylase (PYC1 or PYC2), malate dehydrogenase (‘MDH1 or ‘MDH2), and malic 
enzyme (sMAE1) to improve NADPH regeneration. Only the PYC1, ‘MDH2, sMAE1 
combination increased the titer of fatty alcohols produced by engineered S. cerevi-
siae indicating that not all combinations of POM cycle enzymes could drive this path-
way. Metabolomic analysis revealed that introduction of the POM cycle altered the 
concentration of intermediates in amino acid biosynthetic pathways and the trichlo-
roacetic acid cycle suggesting that the POM cycle had wider effects than previously 
anticipated. Overexpression of the endogenous NAD+ kinases UTR1, YEF1, and 
a cytosolic version of POS5 were also tested. Only expression of POS5c resulted 
a significant increase in fatty alcohol titer. In these minimally engineered strains, 
combined overexpression of the PYC1, ‘MDH2, sMAE1 POM cycle and POS5c did 
not further increase titers. These findings indicate that more extensive metabolomic 
and proteomic investigations are required to identify combinations of enzymes that 
will yield an optimal increase in NADPH to meet anabolic demands without imposing 
excessive metabolic burden or disrupting pathways that might compromise bioprod-
uct synthesis.
Introduction
Metabolic engineering of microbial strains can perturb metabolite abundance and 
redox-cofactor availability creating bottlenecks that hinder growth and negatively 
influence the titers, rates and yields (TRY) of desired products [1–3]. In particular, 
upregulation of biosynthetic processes can increase demand for the reduced form

of Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide Phosphate (NADPH), which plays a vital role 
in driving many anabolic reactions [4]. Therefore, achieving high titers of products 
through metabolic engineering relies on a steady supply of NADPH. This can be 
provided: (i) from NADP+ by NADP+-dependent enzymes (ii) from NAD+ or NADH 
kinases and (iii) by catalyzing the reaction NADH + NADP+ ⇄ NAD+ + NADPH through 
the activity of transhydrogenases [5].
An increased demand for NADPH is particularly salient in the production of fatty 
acid-based chemicals. Fatty acid synthesis requires 14 molecules of NADPH for the 
production of one C16 acyl chain. Additionally, the terminal enzymes employed in 
many conversion processes such as the production of fatty alcohols by fatty acyl-
CoA reductases (FAR) also rely on NADPH as cofactors. Approaches to improving 
NADPH generation by microbial cells have clustered around three themes: (i) elim-
ination or knockdown of competitive pathways, (ii) altering cofactor preference of 
overexpressed enzymes, (iii) and the transformation of NAD+ to its analog NADP+ 
[5]. The first two approaches can be uniquely targeted to specific production path-
ways. However, efficiently transforming NAD+ to NADP+, through the overexpression 
of transhydrogenases, transhydrogenase-like shunts or NAD+ kinases is a general 
mechanism to improve NADPH availability that can be applied to a wide variety of 
bioengineering projects without altering the net carbon flux.
In many organisms, NAD(P)+-dependent transhydrogenases play an important 
role in maintaining cellular redox poise and regenerating NAD+ and NADPH by 
catalyzing the reaction: NADH + NADP+ ⇄ NAD+ + NADPH [6]. Yeasts do not encode 
NAD(P)+-dependent transhydrogenases and rely on other routes to regenerate 
NADPH [7]. Heterologous expression of membrane-bound and soluble transhydro-
genases from Azotobacter vinelandii and Escherichia coli in Saccharomyces cerevi-
siae have been unsuccessful in generating NADPH [8–10]. Therefore, expression of 
bacterial transhydrogenases is thought not to be a viable route for NADPH production 
in S. cerevisiae.
Some oleaginous yeasts encode a cytosolic malic enzyme and can utilize a 
three-enzyme transhydrogenase-like cycle referred to as the pyruvate-oxaloacetate- 
malate or “POM” cycle [11]. In the POM cycle, pyruvate is converted to oxaloace-
tate by pyruvate carboxylase (Pyc), oxaloacetate is then converted to malate, by 
malate dehydrogenase (Mdh), and malate is converted back to pyruvate by the 
malic enzyme (Mae) (Fig 1A). The net stoichiometry of these enzymatic reactions, 
ATP + NADH + NADP+ → +ADP + Pi + NAD+ + NADPH, is essentially identical to that of 
the bacterial transhydrogenase except that ATP is also utilized [6]. The presence of 
a cytosolic malic enzyme is important as NADPH cannot freely cross the mitochon-
drial membrane. Also salient is that the cycle regenerates pyruvate, a key intermedi-
ate in many cellular processes and does not alter the net carbon flux. The lack of a 
cytosolic malic enzyme in S. cerevisiae means that a fully cytosolic POM cycle does 
not naturally exist in these yeasts. Instead, much of the cytosolic reducing power is 
provided through the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Zwf1) and 6- 
phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (Gnd1) steps of the pentose phosphate 
pathway, the cytosolic NADP+-specific isocitrate dehydrogenase (Idp2) and the

NADP+-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase (Ald6) [12]. Mitochondrial NADPH is generated through the mitochondrial 
NAD+ kinase (Pos5), through the activity of aldehyde dehydrogenases (Ald4/5) and through the activity of mitochondrial 
NADP+-dependant malic enzyme (Mae1) [13].

and to increase the pools of NADPH in different cellular compartments [12,14–16]. These POM cycles have employed the 
endogenous protein isoforms Pyc2 and Mdh2 and either the endogenous malic enzyme (Mae1) or a truncated cytosolic 
version (sMae1). More recently, a POM cycle was established utilizing Pyc1, Mdh3 and a heterologous malic enzyme from 
Rhodosporidium toruloides (RtME) to reprogram S. cerevisiae from alcoholic fermentation to lipogenesis [17]. However, a 
comparison of the efficacy of the various shunts has not been reported.
We elected to generate and test POM cycles composed of endogenous isoforms of pyruvate carboxylase encoded 
by PYC1 or PYC2, malate dehydrogenase encoded by MDH1 or MDH2 and the sole malic enzyme encoded by MAE1. 
Endogenous enzymes were selected based on the high likelihood that they would be successfully expressed in S. cerevi-
siae. MAE1 was included in all combinations but was modified by removal of the mitochondrial signal sequence to ensure 
it would be localized to the cytosol [18]. S. cerevisiae encodes three isoforms of malate dehydrogenase each with distinct 
cellular functions. Mdh1 is a mitochondrial enzyme operating in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and the malate/aspar-
tate shuttle primarily to synthesize oxaloacetate from malate [19,20]. Mdh2 is cytosolic, functions primarily in gluconeo-
genesis to make malate from oxaloacetate, and is targeted for proteolysis in glucose containing media [21–24]. Mdh3 is 
peroxisomal and functions in the glyoxylate cycle [25]. MDH1 and MDH2 were included in our POM cycle combinations as 
they have been reported to have high catalytic activity and to accumulate in the cytosol [26]. S. cerevisiae also encodes 
two isoforms of pyruvate carboxylase encoded by PYC1 and PYC2. The distinct roles of Pyc1 and Pyc2 in S. cerevisiae 
are less clear, however they are differentially regulated in response to carbon and nitrogen sources [27–29]. The effective-
ness of different combinations of Mdh and Pyc isoforms when combined with Mae1 in the cytosol as part of synthetic POM 
cycles has not been reported.
Transformation of NAD+ to NADP+ by S. cerevisiae, is naturally accomplished through the activity of NAD+ kinases 
Yef1, Utr1 and Pos5 [30,31]. POS5 encodes a mitochondrial kinase that preferentially phosphorylates NADH [13]. Both 
the endogenous Pos5 and a modified isoform lacking the mitochondrial signal sequence have been used successfully to 
counter redox imbalance in metabolic engineering studies [32–34]. YEF1 and UTR1 encode cytosolic paralogs that dis-
play activity towards both NAD+ and NADH. Overexpression of UTR1 improved ethanol production in an engineered strain 
of S. cerevisiae [35], however, to the best of our knowledge overexpression of YEF1 has not been investigated for its 
effects on biosynthetic processes and a general comparison of the effectiveness of overexpression of these NAD+ kinases 
on biosynthetic processes is lacking.
The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of these general methods for using the more abundant (NAD+ and 
NADH) cofactors to generate NADPH for fatty acid-based chemical production in S. cerevisiae. We established and 
tested four synthetic POM cycles composed of distinct combinations of malic enzyme, pyruvate carboxylase and malate 
dehydrogenase isoforms for their effects on fatty alcohol production. In addition, we investigated the effects of cytosolic 
overexpression of the three endogenous NAD+ kinases on fatty alcohol production. Finally, we investigated whether the 
best performing POM cycle could have additive effects when combined with the overexpression of NAD+ kinases on fatty 
alcohol production in S. cerevisiae.
Methods
Strains, media and cultivations
E. coli DH5αwas used for the construction and propagation of all plasmid constructs. E. coli strains were cultured at 37°C 
in lysogeny broth (LB) supplemented with ampicillin (100 µg/mL). S. cerevisiae strains W303 MATa ade2−201 his3−11,15 
leu2−3,112 trp1−1 ura3−1 can1 and BY4741 MATa his3Δ1 leu2Δ0 met15Δ0 ura3Δ0 were cultured in either YEPD medium 
(Yeast extract 10 g/L, peptone 20 g/L, D-glucose 20 g/L) or synthetic defined media (SD) lacking leucine (-leu), uracil (-ura), 
or both leucine and uracil (-leu -ura) as appropriate (20 g/L glucose, 5 g/L ammonium sulfate, 1.7 g/L yeast nitrogenous 
base (YNB) without amino acids and 2 g/L of amino acid drop out mix). SD-KAc medium is SD medium with 2% potassium 
acetate replacing glucose. SD-Asp medium is SD with 0.5% aspartic acid replacing the ammonium sulfate.

Plasmid and strain construction
Plasmids and strains used in this study are listed in Table 1; oligonucleotides utilized for plasmid and strain construction 
are listed in S1 Table. The PYC1, PYC2, MDH1, and MDH2 open reading frames and transcriptional terminators, the 
open reading frame of MAE1, the TEF1, HXT7 and FBA1 promoters and CDC28 3’UTR were amplified from S. cerevisiae 
W303 genomic DNA using the appropriate oligonucleotide primers (S1 Table). The oligonucleotides were designed to 
delete amino-terminal coding sequence implicated in protein instability (MDH2) or targeting the enzyme to the mitochon-
dria (MDH1, MAE1) and to introduce necessary homologies and restriction sites for assembling the genes into distinct 
combinations for POM cycle expression (Fig 1B). All gene fragments were assembled into the yeast/E. coli shuttle vector, 
YEplac181 [36] via Gibson isothermal assembly [37] thus creating four distinct POM cycle expressing cassettes (Table 
1). The gene cassettes were then excised and transferred to the centromere containing plasmid YCplac111. Single gene 
control vectors were generated both with and without a carboxyl-terminal MYC epitope tag via Gibson assembly utilizing 
oligonucleotides listed in S1 Table. The YEplac195bb-PPGK1-ScFAR plasmids were constructed by inserting a codon 
optimized Mus musculus FAR1 (ScFAR) into YEplac195-PPGK1 [38]. Genes encoding S. cerevisiae NAD+ kinases UTR1, 
YEF1, and POS5c under the regulation of a PYK1 promoter were subsequently assembled into this vector to yield a vec-
tor over expressing each of the NAD+ kinases and ScFAR1.
For overexpression of FAS1 a 3430 bp DNA fragment encompassing the 5’ coding sequence of FAS1 was ligated 
behind a PGK1 promoter fragment (PPGK1) in integrating vector pRS303. The vector was digested with PacI to target 
integration to FAS1 thus placing the chromosomal FAS1 coding sequence under control of the PGK1 promoter. The PYC2 
coding sequence in DSY 1724 was replaced with a NatMX6 cassette using PCR mediated homologous recombination 
[39] with oligonucleotides PYC2D5 and PYC2D3 (S1 Table). All plasmids were verified by sequencing. Constructs were 
introduced into S. cerevisiae by lithium acetate mediated transformation [40] selecting for transformants on the appropri-
ate synthetic medium. All resulting strains were verified by PCR amplification of diagnostic fragments from total chromo-
somal DNA.
Protein extraction and western blotting
Control strain BMY01 and strains BMY07-BMY10 expressing MYC tagged proteins were cultured overnight in SD -leu 
medium, diluted 1:25 in fresh YEPD and incubated at 30°C until an OD600 of 0.5 was achieved. Total protein was extracted 
from 10 mL of culture via a trichloroacetic acid extraction [41]. Protein concentrations were determined by BCA assay [42]. 
Protein samples (20 µg) were separated by electrophoresis using 8% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to a poly-
vinylidene difluoride membrane (Immobilon-P, Millipore). The membrane was probed with anti-MYC mouse monoclonal 
antibody 9E10 (MMS-150R, Covance Laboratories) diluted 1:10,000 in TBST (3.0 g/L Tris-base, 8.0 g/L NaCl, 0.2 g/L KCl, 
pH 7.5, 0.2% Tween 20) supplemented with 5% skim milk powder, followed by washing with TBST and incubation with 
HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1706516 Biorad Labs) diluted 1:5000 prior to visualization with enhanced chemilu-
minescence. The membrane was stripped and re-probed with mouse monoclonal anti-PSTAIRE (P7962, Sigma-Aldrich) 
also diluted 1:10,000 in TBST + 5% skim milk powder to detect Cdc28 as a loading control. Primary antibody was detected 
with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (1706516 Biorad Labs) diluted 1:5000 prior to visualization with enhanced 
chemiluminescence.
RNA extraction and RT-qPCR analysis
RNA was prepared as described [43]. 5 µL of each RNA sample was separated on a 1% bleach gel [44] for assessment of 
RNA quality. Purity and concentration of RNA samples were determined spectrophotometrically. Nucleic acid preparations 
were digested with RNase-free DNase I and cDNA synthesis was performed using 1 µg of total RNA and iScript reverse 
transcriptase supermix according to manufacturer’s protocol. No-RT controls were performed with the omission of the RT. 
qPCR reactions were in a total volume of 10 µL containing 10 pmol of forward and reverse primers (listed in S1 Table), 5.0

µL 2X iQ SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) and 1.25 µL of the RT reaction as template. A three-cycle amplification was 
performed (95°C for 10 s, 54°C for 15 s, 72°C for 20 s) with melt curve (ramping from 72°C to 95°C) using the Rotor-Gene 
Q, real-time PCR cycler (Qiagen). No-RT and no-template controls were included and all unknowns were tested in techni-
cal triplicates. Actin-specific primers were used to normalize the data. Amplification efficiency of all primer pairs was tested 
prior to use in RT-qPCR and were found to be between 90–105% efficiency.
Fatty alcohol extraction and analysis
Cell cultures (25 mL) were overlaid with dodecane (2.5 mL) spiked with a pentadecanol internal standard. Following the 
72-hour growth period, the culture was pelleted by centrifugation (2800 x g, 5 min, 4oC). The dodecane layer was isolated 
and then either used directly or 100 µL of the upper dodecane phase was diluted in 900 µL ethyl acetate. A 1 μL aliquot 
was analyzed via GC-FID using an Agilent 6890 series GC System equipped with a CP-Wax 58 FFAP CB column (25m x 
320 μm x 0.2 μm, Agilent, USA). Helium was used as a carrier gas, with a constant flow of 1 mL/min. The temperature of 
the inlet was 240°C. The following program was applied: 50°C for 1 minute, increase 25°C/minute to 170°C followed by 
10°C/min to 240°C, hold at 240°C for 7 minutes. The internal standards were used to determine product yields, in con-
junction with calibration curves and known relative response factors. Mean values were determined from three indepen-
dent biological replicates unless otherwise stated.
NADPH/NADP+ analysis
S. cerevisiae cultures harboring an empty vector or POM cycle encoding plasmid were adjusted to 1 x 107 cells/mL, 
cooled on ice, collected by centrifugation (3000 x g, 5 min), washed in ice cold water, resuspended in 500 µL extraction 
buffer and stored at -80oC overnight. Subsequently, cell pellets were thawed on ice, NADP+ and NADPH concentrations 
were determined by colorimetric assay (MAK479, Millipore-Sigma, Canada) following the manufacturer directions. Statis-
tical analysis was performed by application of a 1-way ANOVA test and Tukey HSD was applied as a post-hoc test using 
Prism graphpad (Dotmatics).

Metabolomic analysis
Triplicate samples of S. cerevisiae cultured in SD -leu medium (15 mL) at 30oC with agitation at 200 rpm, harboring either 
the empty vector plasmid YCplac111 or YCpNC2 at OD600 = 0.8 were cooled on ice and harvested by centrifugation for 
3 min at 3000 x g. The cell pellets were washed in ice cold water, frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80oC prior to anal-
ysis. 200 µL of 1:1 (v/v) methanol: water was added into each of the individual sample tubes. The samples were lysed by 
5 cycles of vortexing with glass beads for 1 min, and cooling on ice between bursts of vortexing. 800 µL of 1:1 (v/v) metha-
nol: water was added into each of the tubes. The tubes were vortexed for another 10 min and centrifuged at 15,000 x g for 
10 min at 4°C. All the supernatants were transferred into new vials and dried down. The samples were re-dissolved in 41 
µL of water. The total concentrations of samples were determined by NovaMT Sample Normalization kit. All the samples 
were diluted to 2 mM before labeling. The samples were split into four aliquots for different labeling methods, backup and 
preparation of pooled sample. The aliquot for preparing pooled sample from each individual sample was combined and 
mixed thoroughly to generate the pooled sample, which was used as the reference.
For each aliquot of sample for amine-/phenol- labeling LC-MS grade water was added to dilute the sample and 25 µL of 
sample was used for labeling. The dansyl (DnsCl) and dimethylaminophenacyl (DmPA), labeling protocol was performed 
largely as described [45,46]. Briefly, 12.5 µL of 0.5 M NaHCO3/Na2CO3 buffer and 37.5 µL of 12C2-DnsCl (for the individual 
samples and the pooled sample) or 13C2-DnsCl (for the pooled sample) was added into samples. The samples were then 
vortexed and collected by centrifugation. The mixtures were incubated at 40°C for 45 minutes. labelling reactions were 
quenched by addition of 7.5 µL of 250 mM NaOH. The mixtures were incubated at 40°C for another 10 minutes. Finally, 30 
µL of 425 mM formic acid was added.
The aliquot of sample for carboxyl labeling was dried and re-dissolved in 25 µL of 3:1 (v/v) acetonitrile: water. Briefly, 
10 µL triethanolamine and 25 µL of 12C2-DmPA (for the individual samples and the pooled sample) or 13C2-DmPA (for the 
pooled sample) was added into samples. The mixtures were incubated at 80°C for 60 minutes. Reactions were quenched 
by addition of 40 µL of triphenylacetic acid. The mixtures were incubated at 80°C for another 30 minutes and the chemi-
cal isotope labeling procedure was complete. The 12C2-labeled individual sample was mixed with 13C2-labeled reference 
sample in equal amount. Prior to LC-MS analysis of the entire sample set, quality control (QC) sample was prepared by 
equal volume mix of a 12C-labeled and a 13C-labeled pooled sample. Metabolite analysis was performed using LC-MS with 
an Agilent 1290 HPLC instrument linked to Bruker Impact II QTOF Mass Spectrometer. The HPLC column was an Agilent 
Eclipse plus revered-phase C18 column (150 x 2.1 mm, 1.8 µm particle size). Separation was performed with buffers MPA 
0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water, MPB 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in acetonitrile using a gradient t = 0 min, 25% B; t = 10 min, 99% 
B; t = 15 min, 99% B; t = 15.1 min, 25% B; t = 18 min, 25% B, Flow rate 400 µL/min, column Oven temp 40oC, MS data in the 
Mass range m/z 220–1000 were collected with an acquisition rate 1 Hz.
A total of 18 LC-MS data from 2-channel analysis (9 LC-MS data, including 3 QC in each channel) were first exported 
to.csv file with Bruker DataAnalysis 4.4. The exported data were uploaded to IsoMS Pro 1.2.15 for Data Quality Check 
and Data Processing. Statistical analysis and volcano plots were performed using MetaboAnalyst 6.0 (www.metaboana-

Results
Construction of synthetic POM cycles
The proposed mechanism of carbon shuttling and generation of NADPH by a POM cycle is shown in Fig 1A. Key to effec-
tively engaging this cycle is over production of enzymes that have pyruvate carboxylase activity (Pyc), NADH dependent 
malate dehydrogenase activity (Mdh) and NADP+ dependent malate decarboxylase activity (Mae). The enzymes must 
be compartmentalized in the cytosol to have ready access to the same pool of intermediates and be able to regenerate 
NADPH making it available for cytosolic anabolic processes (Fig 1A).

Gene cassettes encoding four distinct sets of POM cycle enzymes were constructed in the Yeast/E.coli shuttle vector 
YCplac111 (YCpNC1–4; Table 1). Each cassette contains a truncated version of the S. cerevisiae malic enzyme gene 
(sMAE1), lacking the first 90 nucleotides encoding amino acids that form a mitochondrial targeting signal [18]. This variant 
of Mae1 localizes to the cytosol [18]. The truncated MAE1 coding sequence was placed under the regulation of an FBA1 
promoter and a 3’ UTR sequence derived from CDC28. The cassettes also contain the gene sequences for either of the S.

cerevisiae isoforms of pyruvate carboxylase (PYC1 or PYC2) and an isoform of malate dehydrogenase (‘MDH1 or ‘MDH2) 
resulting in four combinatorial arrangements (Fig 1B).
Differing from most other eukaryotic cells, S. cerevisiae encodes two isoenzymes of pyruvate carboxylase that are 
localized to the cytosol rather than a single mitochondrial enzyme. Expression of the isoforms is differentially regulated 
at the level of transcription depending on factors such as growth phase, carbon source and nitrogen source [27–29]. The 
PYC1 and PYC2 coding sequences were placed under the regulation of an HXT7 promoter to limit differential transcrip-
tional regulation but retained their native 3’ UTR regions (Fig 1B). Each protein isoform displays different allosteric prop-
erties with respect to acetyl-CoA activation and aspartate inhibition with Pyc1 displaying a higher degree of cooperativity 
[47]. In addition, Pyc2 reportedly displays lower abundance and reduced activity in glucose [27]. Therefore, it is reason-
able to predict that despite providing the same promoter for PYC1 and PYC2 that the encoded isoforms may display 
differences in activity when incorporated into the synthetic POM cycles.
For the expression of malate dehydrogenase, we aimed to utilize versions that would be both cytosolic and stable in 
medium containing glucose as the carbon source. To achieve this, a nucleotide sequence encoding the 17 amino acid 
mitochondrial signal sequence was deleted from MDH1 [20]. Mdh2 is subject to both transcriptional repression and degra-
dation in the presence of glucose [22]; therefore, to stabilize Mdh2, the nucleotide sequence encoding 12 amino acids at 
the amino-terminus was deleted in the constructs used in this study. The coding sequences for both Mdh1 and Mdh2 were 
placed under the regulation of an TEF1 promoter and both retained their native 3’ UTR sequences (Fig 1A). Each of the 
combinations of genes were assembled and inserted into a centromeric vector YCplac111 to form YCpNC1 (PYC1, ‘MDH2 
sMAE1), YCpNC2 (PYC1 MDH1 sMAE1), YCpNC3 (PYC2 MDH2 sMAE1), YCpNC4 (PYC2 MDH1 sMAE1) (Fig 1B).
Verification of protein isoform expression
To confirm expression of the individual variants of pyruvate carboxylase and malate dehydrogenase, S. cerevisiae strains 
harboring centromeric vectors encoding the individual PYC1, PYC2, ‘MDH1 and ‘MDH2 variants that had been modified 
by the addition of a carboxyl-terminal MYC epitope were assayed by western blot. A control strain, BMY01 harboring an 
empty vector displayed no signal consistent with anti-MYC reactive proteins but the loading control Cdc28 can clearly be 
detected (Fig 2A, lane 1). In contrast, sample lanes loaded with extract from BMY07 and BMY08 displayed specific bands 
reacting with the anti-MYC antibodies migrating at 35 kDa and 40 kDa consistent with the predicted molecular weight 
of Mdh1 and Mdh2 (Fig 2A, lanes 2, 3). Extract from strains BMY09 and BMY10 displayed bands migrating at 130 kDa 
consistent with the predicted molecular weights of Pyc1 and Pyc2 (Fig 2A lanes 2, 3). Pyc1-MYC repeatably accumulated 
to a greater abundance than Pyc2. These results suggest that either Pyc1 is translated more efficiently or is more stable 
than Pyc2 under the culture conditions consistent with the previously observed higher abundance and activity of Pyc2 
when cells are cultured in glucose supplemented medium [27]. The ‘Mdh1-MYC and ‘Mdh2-MYC variants tested displayed 
similar abundance to one another.
Having confirmed that the individual components of the synthetic POM cycles were being expressed we introduced 
plasmids encoding the POM cycle variations into S. cerevisiae XDY1. The open reading frames of PYC1 and PYC2 were 
both under the regulation of an HXT7 promoter, which was expected to limit the differences in transcriptional regulation 
between the two but qPCR analysis demonstrated that the mRNA for PYC2 (grey bars) accumulated to higher levels than 
the mRNA for PYC1 (brown bars) (Fig 2B compare BMY13 - BMY15, BMY14 – BMY 16).
Interestingly, we observed that strains overexpressing ‘MDH1 (BMY14, BMY16) displayed a concurrent 3–4-fold 
increase in mRNA from the endogenous MDH2 while this did not appear to be true for cells overexpressing ‘MDH2 
(BMY13, BMY15) (Fig 2B). There is no published report of Mdh1 influencing the expression of MDH2 but it is unlikely that 
this would be detrimental to the functioning of the synthetic POM cycle. The sMAE1 mRNA (green bars) was constant 
among the four POM cycles.

The function of the PYC1 and PYC2 genes encoded on the POM cycle plasmids was tested by complementation of a 
pyc1::KanMX4 pyc2::NatMX6 strain. The double mutant displays auxotrophy for aspartic acid and is viable and competent 
for growth on SD – leu medium supplemented with 0.5% aspartate as a nitrogen source independent of whether it carries 
an empty vector (Fig 2C, upper section, lane 1), or any of the plasmids encoding a POM cycle or individual enzymes of the 
POM cycle (Fig 2C upper section, lanes 2–10). In contrast, when aspartate is replaced with ammonium sulphate as the 
nitrogen source, cells carrying empty vector or any plasmid not encoding PYC1 or PYC2 failed to form colonies (Fig 2A, 
lower panel, lanes 1–3, 6). Cells that carried plasmids YCNC1 - YCNC4, encoding either PYC1 or PYC2 all displayed the 
ability to complement the pyc1 pyc2 mutant consistent with the PYC gene on each POM cycle plasmid being functional.
The function of the ‘MDH1 and ‘MDH2 genes encoded by the POM cycle plasmids were tested by complementation of 
an mdh2::KanMX4 strains growth defect on medium supplemented with acetate as the carbon source. The mdh2::KanMX4 
strain is viable and able to form colonies on SD – leu medium that has glucose as a carbon source independent of whether 
the strain carries an empty vector or a plasmid encoding the POM cycle genes individually or in combination (Fig 2D, upper 
panel lanes 1–10). In contrast, when glucose is replaced with 2% potassium acetate (KAc) as a carbon source only cells 
carrying a plasmid encoding ‘MDH2 or ‘MDH1 displayed colony formation (Fig 2D, lower panel, lanes). Complementation of 
mdh2::KanMX4 growth on SD-KAc medium by ‘MDH1 yielded slow growth as has been previously reported [26].
Effect of synthetic POM cycles on fatty alcohol production
As NADPH availability is extremely salient for the production of oleochemicals in microbial systems, we investigated the 
effects of the four synthetic POM cycles in an S. cerevisiae strain minimally engineered to produce fatty alcohol. These 
strains (BMY12 - BMY16; Table 1) overexpress Fatty acyl synthetase subunit FAS1 under regulation of the strong con-
stitutive PGK1 promoter and express a codon-optimized version of the Mus musculus fatty acyl-CoA reductase (ScFAR). 
Increased expression of FAS1 results in a coinciding increase in the levels of FAS2 yielding an overall increase in the 
expression of the FAS complex responsible for fatty acyl-CoA synthesis [48]. This increases fatty acid biosynthesis activ-
ity, ultimately creating an increased demand for NADPH in the cells. As the reactions catalyzed by both the FAS complex 
and ScFAR1 enzyme are NADPH-dependent (Fig 1) we hypothesized the availability of NADPH may become limiting in 
this synthetic pathway and that the synthetic POM cycles would increase availability of NADPH and drive increased flux 
through the pathway resulting in an increased titer of fatty alcohols.
Seven independent colonies from each transformation (BMY12 – BMY17) were tested for fatty alcohol production in 
shake flask culture. There was a high degree of variability in the titer of fatty alcohols produced among individual trans-
formants carrying the same plasmid (Figure A and B in S1 File). The production characteristic of a transformant was 
clonal. When a high producing colony was streaked to isolate independent colonies all of those plasmid-bearing colonies 
consistently maintain high levels of production. Three single colonies were isolated from each of the highest producing 
candidates from the strains (BMY12 - BMY17) and tested for fatty alcohol production (Fig 3A). The BMY13 strain (PYC1, 
‘MDH2, sMAE1) significantly increased fatty alcohol production by 40% over the control strain BMY12 (10.2 ± 0.5 mg/L/
OD vs 6.1 ± 0.4 mg/L/OD, p = 0.002) (Fig 3A). Interestingly, an ~ 20% decrease in fatty alcohol production was observed for 
the PYC2 overexpressing strains BMY15 and BMY16 (Fig C in S1 File). However, when normalized for biomass density 
BMY15 (PYC2, ‘MDH2, sMAE1) and BMY16 (PYC2, ‘MDH1, sMAE1) produced fatty alcohol similar to the vector control 
strain BMY12, 6.1 ± 0.4 mg/L/OD (Fig 3A). Overexpression of the individual genes sMAE1, ‘MDH1, ‘MDH2, PYC1, PYC2 
showed no increase in fatty alcohol over the control strain. (Figure S3 File).
POM cycle expression has limited effects on steady state NADPH/NADP+ ratios
The engineered POM cycles were designed with the expectation that they could increase the regeneration of NADPH 
making more available for biosynthetic processes. To further investigate the metabolic effect of POM cycle expression 
an enzymatic assay was performed on whole cell extracts to determine the concentrations of NADP+ and NADPH. A

comparison of the relative NADPH/NADP+ assayed in extracts prepared from the strains harboring an empty vector or 
each of the independent POM cycle plasmids indicated that no statistically significant increase in NADPH/NADP+ could be 
detected, NC1 p = 0.378, NC2 p = 0.981, NC3 p = 0.703, NC4 p = 1.000. It is likely that the considerable variation among the 
replicates (n = 9) contributed to this finding (Fig 3B). Measurable changes in NADPH in the system may be challenging to 
assay biochemically as elevating the NADPH is expected to promote NADPH driven anabolic pathways and the cells will 
seek homeostasis in the abundance of the redox cofactors.
POM cycle influences amino acid biosynthetic pathways
The synthetic POM cycles are envisioned to take advantage of the relatively abundant NADH and ATP available in 
cells actively proliferating under aerobic fermentative conditions and generate elevated NADPH that could be used 
to drive anabolic pathways. While the enzymatic reactions can function cyclically starting with and regenerating 
pyruvate they do not act in isolation and the metabolites: pyruvate, malate and oxaloacetate are important interme -
diates in other pathways that could potentially be disrupted by their sequestration within a POM cycle. To determine 
whether the POM cycles tested in this study influenced the abundance of other intermediates in central metabolism 
we performed a limited metabolomic analysis on independent biological replicates (n = 3) that carried either the 
empty vector or the POM cycle cassette, NC1, that yielded the most significant increase in fatty alcohol production in 
our test strain.
Metabolite analysis identified 512 metabolites with high confidence that were used for further pathway analysis (S2 
Table). Multi-variate analysis using unsupervised principal components analysis (PCA) indicated that significant differ-
ences were displayed between the NC1 expressing cultures and those with the empty vector control (Fig 4A). PC1 and 
PC2 give an explanation rate of 63.2% with PC1 accounting for 37% of the variation. Supervised orthogonal projections to 
latent structures discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was used to distinguish differentially abundant metabolites between the

thesis and degradation pathways for aspartic acid, alanine, arginine, and lysine (Fig 4C). The data were further summa-

NC1 POM cycle producing strain (red) and the empty vector containing strain (green) were clustered together indicating 
relative homogeneity and reproducibility in the change among the top 50 metabolites in the analysis (Fig 4D).
Differential analysis was employed to further examine differences among identified metabolites that display statisti -
cally significant changes in abundance between strains. As indicated by the volcano plot there were significant differ -
ences displayed among a subset of the positively identified metabolites. When using a fold change threshold FC > 1.5, 
p < 0.05 a significant increase in abundance was displayed by 13 metabolites in the NC1 POM cycle expressing strains 
(Fig 5A, red scatter plot points). There were 21 metabolites displaying a significant decrease in the NC1 POM cycle 
expressing strain ( Fig 5A, blue scatter plot points). Although OAA was not unambiguously detected, pyruvate and

malate were clearly identified in the analysis and no significant difference between the strains in the concentration of 
either metabolite was detected ( S2 Table). An increase in arginine biosynthesis intermediate citrulline (fold change 
2.33 p = 0.00094) was detected along with, lysine biosynthetic pathway intermediates saccharopine (fold change 2.55 
p = 0.040), and lysopine (fold change 1.85 p = 0.0014). Additionally, an increase in 5-hydroxyectoine (fold change 1.88 
p = 0.007) which could be derived from aspartic acid catabolism was also detected ( Fig 5A). Conversely, significant 
decreases in the abundance of aspartic acid (fold change 0.43 p = 0.00038), fumarate (fold change 0.53 p = 0.006) 
and citrate (fold change 0.49 p = 0.04) were detected ( Fig 5, S2 Table). Hence, elevating the concentration of Pyc1 
and Mdh2 and introducing malic enzyme to the cytosol may have unplanned consequences to off target metabolic 
pathways.
The metabolite set identified as high-confidence results were subsequently subjected to metabolic pathway analysis 
using Global Test as enrichment analysis and Relative-betweenness Centrality as topology analysis in MetaboAnalyst. 
The data, graphed as scatter-plot of the metabolites p-value against pathway impact, suggests perturbation of several 
metabolic pathways, most notably amino acid synthesis and metabolism pathways (Fig 5C). Other pathways including 
pyruvate and glutathione metabolism are summarized in S3 Table.
Effect of NAD+ kinase expression on fatty alcohol production
An alternative to the use of synthetic POM cycles to increase NADPH, is to express enzymes with NAD + kinase 
activity. To determine whether overexpression of NAD + kinase activity could improve fatty alcohol biosynthesis, 
YEF1, UTR1 and a cytosolic version of POS5, denoted POS5c, were introduced into a high-copy plasmid also har -
boring ScFAR1 and these constructs were installed in S. cerevisiae . Overexpression of UTR1 (BMY27) or YEF1 
(BMY31) resulted in no significant increase in fatty alcohol production over the control strain BMY12, increasing 
from 7.23 ± 0.65 mg/L/OD to 8.13 ± 0.77 mg/L/OD (p = 0.057) and 6.48 ± 1.34 mg/L/OD (p = 0.25) (Fig 6). Overexpres -
sion of cytosolic POS5c (BMY29) resulted in a significant increase in fatty alcohol titers from 7.23 ± 0.66 mg/L/OD 
to 11.95 ± 0.82 mg/L/OD p = 0.003 (Fig 6). On their own we found that only POS5c was effective at increasing fatty 
alcohol production and that the increase in production was comparable to expressing the best POM cycle composed 
of PYC1, ‘MDH2, sMAE1  on plasmid YCpNC1. In this independent trial, we found that expressing the POM cycle 
enzymes encoded by YCpNC1 yielded fatty alcohol production of 11.87 ± 0.52 mg/L/OD while expressing Pos5c 
resulted in 11.95 ± 0.82 mg/L/OD fatty alcohols.
We next sought to investigate whether expression of the NAD + kinases and our synthetic POM cycle could 
be combined to further increase fatty alcohol production. When combined with YCpNC1 encoding POM cycle 
enzymes PYC1, ‘MDH2, and sMAE1 , the overexpression of YEF1 and UTR1 had similar effects as they did when 
expressed with the empty vector control YCplac111 ( Fig 6). UTR1 overexpression combined with YCpNC1 (BMY30) 
resulted in a trend toward increased fatty alcohol production compared to the control expressing YCpNC1 (BMY13) 
12.6 ± 2.23 mg/L/OD vs 11.87 ± 0.52 mg/L/OD p = 0.41. The YEF1 overexpressing strain BMY31 resulted in a slight 
decrease in fatty alcohol production compared to BMY13. These strains BMY30, BMY31 also displayed the same 
reduction in final cell density associated with the YCpNC1 carrying control strain (BMY13). The decrease in growth 
associated with these strains may be due to the fact that both NAD + kinases and the Pyc1 in the POM cycle are 
ATP-dependent, and therefore effective generation of NADPH to drive fatty alcohol production will occur at the 
expense of ATP driven processes. Interestingly, combining the overexpression of POS5c and YCpNC1 into strain 
BMY32 did not result in synergistic or even additive effects on fatty alcohol production. Fatty alcohol production 
in BMY32 (9.58 ± 0.05 mg/L/OD) was less than in the cells expressing either Pos5c alone (11.95 ± 0.82 mg/L/OD, 
p < 0.0001) or the Pyc1, ‘Mdh2, sMae1 POM cycle (BMY13) (11.87 ± 0.05 mg/L/OD, p < 0.0001). The decrease in fatty 
alcohol production in this strain is also associated with a reduced cell density suggesting extensive metabolic burden 
or a negative effect caused by the combination of overexpressed gene products.

Discussion
Re-wiring metabolic pathways in microbial cells to generate cell factories capable of efficient production of desirable 
bioproducts is a major goal of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering. This is a challenging goal as the endogenous 
metabolism of cells is optimized for the purpose of biomass accumulation within the organism’s native environment. Alter-
ing the flux of carbon and intermediates toward the desired bioproducts typically introduces some degree of metabolic 
burden and disrupts the flow of intermediates in ways that are not simple to predict.
Many anabolic pathways depend on the availability of NADPH, which can become limiting. In the yeast S. cerevisiae 
two strategies for increasing available NADPH in the cytosol have been investigated. One is expression of enzymatic 
POM cycles with transhydrogenase-like activity to drive NADPH recycling at the expense of ATP. Alternatively, NAD+ 
kinases can be employed to exploit the more abundant NADH at the expense of ATP. We found that a POM cycle consist-
ing of Pyc1, truncated Mdh2 and cytosolically localized Mae1 (YCpNC1) increased fatty alcohol product titers significantly 
in S. cerevisiae. Although all combinations of the POM cycle enzymes should be capable of increasing NADPH avail-
ability, we determined that the other combinations of enzymes tested were unable to increase fatty alcohol production in 
the context of our experimental strain. Some combinations of POM cycle enzymes lead to unexpected metabolic conse-
quences or increased metabolic burden with little commensurate benefit to redox cofactor biosynthesis. This appears to 
be especially true of strains overexpressing PYC2, where both reduced cell growth and decreased fatty alcohol produc-
tion were observed. Why Pyc1 out performs Pyc2 in these cycles is not clear. It may simply be that Pyc1 accumulates 
to higher levels than Pyc2 or that the relative abundance of Pyc1 and the Mdh expressed results in more stoichiometric 
expression. However, we cannot discount the possibility that the functional differences between the isoforms in this con-
text is due to allosteric regulation by cellular metabolites or other inherent differences between the protein isoforms.
In the context of utilizing a synthetic POM cycle to generate NADPH, the stoichiometry of the enzymes is likely to be 
as important as the total activity for optimal function. High pyruvate carboxylase activity may not be optimal for operation 
of the POM cycle unless it can be matched by the activity of the malate dehydrogenase and malic enzyme. The POM 
cycle employing Pyc1 ‘Mdh2 sMae1 yielded higher fatty alcohol production than did the Pyc1 ‘Mdh1, sMae1 cycle. This

is consistent with the notion that Mdh2 is more effective in the context of this cycle. The coding sequences for the two 
malate dehydrogenase isoforms were modified to provide stable cytosolic expression in glucose and showed comparable 
protein abundance in actively proliferating cells; however, Mdh2 is native to the cytosol whereas Mdh1 normally functions 
in the mitochondria with a different redox environment. It may also be significant that Mdh2 displays a higher affinity for 
NADH than does Mdh1, which may make it more effective in driving the oxaloacetate to malate reaction [25]. Another iso-
form of malate dehydrogenase, the peroxisome associated Mdh3 has also been employed in a POM cycle [17]. However, 
Mdh3 has a significantly lower affinity for oxaloacetate than does Mdh2 suggesting it might not be the best enzyme to 
drive a POM cycle for NADPH synthesis. Additionally other factors may influence the accumulation and activity of Mdh iso-
forms in the cytosol as over production of a cytosolically targeted Mdh3 yields a 2-fold increase in MDH activity compared 
to ‘Mdh2 that gave a 6–8 fold increase [26].
Previous reports on application of synthetic POM cycles for metabolic engineering in S. cerevisiae all employ the 
endogenous Pyc2 with Mdh2 and Mae1. They have been reported to counter the redox imbalance of a heterologous 
xylose fermentation pathway [16] and for the production of isobutanol [15]. However, while the expression of the cycle in 
xylose fermenting conditions was reported to increase the rate of xylose consumption, ultimately it resulted in decreased 
ethanol production [16]. When implemented in isobutanol producing strains, a version of the cycle expressing a truncated 
Mae1 (sMae1p) increased isobutanol production in a strain overexpressing the Ehrlich pathway and ILV2 but had no effect 
on isobutanol titers in other strains [15]. While the efficacy of these POM cycles is not immediately clear [12,14–16], it is 
possible that they may be improved by overexpressing Pyc1 rather than Pyc2 as we have shown that enzyme combina-
tions including Pyc1, when combined with Mdh2, outperform those containing Pyc2. Adding support to this argument, a 
recent report converting S. cerevisiae to lipogenic metabolism utilized a Pyc1 containing POM cycle with success, how-
ever alternate combinations were not reported [17].
Several of the POM cycle enzyme combinations failed to increase fatty alcohol products and reduced cellular growth. 
Even the POM cycle (Pyc1, ‘Mdh2, sMAE1) that did increase fatty alcohol production lead to a perturbation of several 
metabolic intermediates that we could detect. Fumarate and aspartate were significantly reduced while several inter-
mediates in amino acid metabolic pathways were increased. Aspartic acid has a close relationship with central carbon 
metabolism, it can be produced from OAA by transamination and can similarly act as a precursor for OAA production 
[49]. In S. cerevisiae, aspartate is primarily produced by transamination of OAA. The reduction in aspartate in the POM 
cycle expressing strain may reflect a diversion of aspartate to OAA to meet the elevated requirement for OAA required to 
maintain the TCA cycle activity in addition to the increased cytosolic POM cycle activity. Aspartate also acts as a precursor 
in the synthesis of arginine, methionine, isoleucine, asparagine and threonine [4]. It may be significant that we observed 
a reduction in methionine, asparagine and threonine in the POM cycle strain. The reduction in abundance of these amino 
acids did not reach statistical significance but this may have been influenced by the presence of exogenous amino acids 
present in the culture medium. Analysis of strains cultured in fully minimal medium, lacking amino acids would more fully 
elucidate the effects of the POM cycle on amino acid metabolic pathways.
Fumarate is an intermediate in the TCA cycle produced by the oxidation of succinate. It can also be produced from 
arginino-succinate by Arg4 in the urea cycle and synthesis of arginine [50]. The reduction in fumarate observed in POM 
cycle expressing strains could indicate that the POM cycle is drawing pyruvate and intermediates from the tricarboxylic 
acid cycle (TCA), possibly owing to disparity in reaction rates of the POM cycle enzymes. This may be tolerable under 
the ideal laboratory culture conditions but is likely not optimal. This idea is consistent with the increase in citrulline, and 
decreased aspartic acid we observed as the cells may be using these intermediates to synthesize arginino-succinate in 
the urea cycle as a way to replenish fumarate. Several intermediates that were elevated in the POM cycle expression 
strain can be generated by amino acids degradation processes. Citrulline is an intermediate in arginine synthesis but can 
also be produced from arginine in an NADPH dependent reaction [51]. Our metabolomic analysis also identified increases 
in 5-hydroxyectoine, which can be derived from aspartic acid in an NADPH dependent reaction and saccharopine, a

lysine synthesis and degradation intermediate that can be derived from lysine in an NADPH dependent reaction [52]. It is 
currently unclear whether the changes in metabolite abundance in the POM cycle expressing strain are driven directly by 
over expression of one or more of the POM cycle enzymes or are part of the cellular response to alterations in the redox 
cofactor balance induced by the POM cycle.
Central carbon metabolism and the balance of NADPH/NADP+ redox cofactors are tightly linked with amino acid 
metabolism. NADPH is a driver of the lysine, proline and threonine biosynthetic pathways and amino acids can be used 
as precursors for intermediates in TCA cycle, in turn the TCA cycle can provide precursors for amino acid biosynthesis. 
This allows flexibility to replenish intermediates in the TCA and to provide amino acids if needed. This relationship can 
potentially influence the entire metabolic network since NADPH influences flux through most anabolic pathways. Either 
an excess or a deficiency in NADPH has negative effects on cell growth rate and carbon utilization in E. coli highlighting 
the need to balance NADPH availability with cellular needs [53]. Elevating NADPH availability is effective in driving flux 
through engineered anabolic pathways including lipid and fatty alcohol production but excess NAPDH, beyond what can 
be utilized to meet existing cellular needs, has the potential to yield reductive stress [54]. This effect is not well studied in 
yeast but excess NADPH can inhibit Zwf1 and Gnd1 reducing flux through the pentose phosphate pathway with a com-
mensurate increase in flux of carbon through glycolysis [55,56]. This alteration in pathway flux has the potential to change 
the cellular concentrations of a wide range of intermediates. Another potential effect of altering NADPH/NADP+ balance is 
that excess NADPH could drive reactions including amino acid biosynthesis leading to an increase in amino acid synthe-
sis and degradation intermediates [57].
The catalytic activity and abundance of the POM cycle enzymes are not the only factors influencing their effectiveness 
in the context of NADPH regeneration. The cellular localization, spatial organization and native protein-protein interactions 
of the enzymes may have substantial influence on which isoforms will work most effectively together. Physical interactions 
have been demonstrated between Pyc1 - Pyc2, Pyc1 - Mdh1 and Pyc2 - Mdh1 as well as between Mdh1 - Mdh2 and Mdh1 
- Mdh3 [58,59]. It is unclear whether these interactions are all biologically relevant in the endogenous context but they do 
suggest that Mdh1 might be capable of functioning effectively with Pyc1 or Pyc2 in some contexts. Mdh2 has been demon-
strated to self-interact and this may have implications for the ability generate high local concentration of product [60]. Mdh2 
is most active in cells growing on nonfermentable 2-carbon compounds and takes part in the glyoxylate cycle and glucone-
ogenesis. Our study made use of a truncated variant of Mdh2 demonstrated to have increased stability and catalytic activity 
in cells cultured in glucose containing medium [61]. In addition to stabilizing the enzyme the amino-terminal truncation also 
disrupts its physical interactions with partners Pck1 and Fbp1, enzymes that it functions with in gluconeogenesis [62]. Dis-
ruption of those interactions may free the cytosolic Mdh2 to work more effectively with Pyc1 in the context of the POM cycle 
tested in our strains. In this regard installing a POM cycle composed of fully orthogonal enzymes might be more effective 
without the need to overcome endogenous physical interactions with the native enzymes. Synthetic biology approaches 
that could offer alternative strategies to increase the effectiveness of the POM cycle enzymes would be to create a scaffold 
to sequester the POM cycle enzymes together in a cytosolic location or test the potential of expressing enzyme fusions 
separated by flexible linkers to maintain the enzymes in close proximity to one another.
The ability of the cytosolically localized NAD+ kinase Pos5 to improve fatty alcohol synthesis is consistent with the 
effectiveness of this enzyme in yielding improved performance of other engineered metabolic pathways [32,34]. Pos5c 
was the only NAD+ kinase to show a significant increase in fatty alcohol production possibly reflecting that Pos5 phosphor-
ylates NADH preferentially while Yef1 and Utr1 display activity towards both NAD+ and NADH. It is less clear why combin-
ing the POM cycle and Pos5c fails to achieve any additive improvement considering that they draw on different substrates 
to yield NADPH. This may reflect an excess metabolic burden imposed on the cells or the combined activities of these 
pathways may be disruptive toward functions of each other in ways we have failed to predict.
One POM cycle tested in this study was effective in increasing the production of fatty alcohol. The POM cycle also influ-
enced the abundance of intermediates in central carbon metabolism and amino acid metabolism. Thus, from a metabolic 

PLOS One | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0333299 September 29, 2025 19 / 22
engineering perspective, effective design and implementation of a POM cycle to increase NADPH availability will need 
to consider the effects of that cycle on the entire cellular metabolic network. A more comprehensive metabolomic analy-
sis covering a higher fraction of the intermediates in amino acid, purine and pyrimidine synthesis and degradation path-
ways will be required to gain a firmer understanding of the consequence of this POM cycle to cellular metabolism. Those 
data would allow for an improved estimation of the abundance of allosteric regulators of POM cycle enzyme activity to 
guide enzyme selection. This study employed constitutive expression of the POM cycle enzymes. While this is a prac-
tical strategy from the bioproduction perspective it makes direct effects on difficult to separate from secondary effects. 
Further investigations into the effects of POM cycle expression could be performed using inducible POM cycle enzymes 
to allow observations to be made immediately following induction and monitor metabolites to determine how the cells 
metabolic network adapts to the acute increased in NADPH availability. Proteomic analysis of strains expressing POM 
cycle enzymes would also be useful to provide data on enzyme stoichiometry and identify changes in the abundance of 
enzymes in other metabolic pathways affected by the POM cycle. Future attempts to optimize NADPH production in the 
cytoplasm will need to work toward balancing catalytic rates of the enzymes and maintaining local proximity to minimize 
side reactions.
This investigation has revealed that not all POM cycles will be suitable for promoting NADPH regeneration to drive 
anabolic pathways. We have identified one set of POM cycle enzymes proven beneficial for production of fatty alcohols 
and while we can speculate on why the other combinations are less successful it is clear that more extensive testing is 
required to determine what parameters need to be optimized. More extensive metabolomic analysis and potentially meta-
bolic model simulations will benefit our ability to apply this manipulation to achieve predictable improvements in bioproduct 
synthesis.
