Abstract
C4 photosynthesis involves a close collaboration of the C3 and C4 metabolic cycles across the mesophyll and bundle-
sheath cells. This study investigated the coordination of C4 photosynthesis in maize plants subjected to two salinity (50 
and 100 mM NaCl) treatments and one shade (20% of full sunlight) treatment. Photosynthetic efficiency was probed by 
combining leaf gas-exchange measurements with carbon isotope discrimination and assaying the key carboxylases 
[ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC)] and 
decarboxylases [nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate malic enzyme (NADP-ME) and phosphoenolpyruvate 
carboxykinase (PEP-CK)] operating in maize leaves. Generally, salinity inhibited plant growth and photosynthesis to a 
lesser extent than shade. Salinity reduced photosynthesis primarily by reducing stomatal conductance and secondar-
ily by equally reducing Rubisco and PEPC activities; the decarboxylases were inhibited more than the carboxylases. 
Salinity increased photosynthetic carbon isotope discrimination (Δ
p) and reduced leaf dry-matter carbon isotope com-
position (13δ) due to changes in pi/pa (intercellular to ambient CO2 partial pressure), while CO2 leakiness out of the bun-
dle sheath (ϕ) was similar to that in control plants. Acclimation to shade was underpinned by a greater downregulation 
of PEPC relative to Rubisco activity, and a lesser inhibition of NADP-ME (primary decarboxylase) relative to PEP-CK 
(secondary decarboxylase). Shade reduced Δp and ɸ without significantly affecting leaf 13δ or pi/pa relative to control 
plants. Accordingly, shade perturbed the balance between the C3 and C4 cycles during photosynthesis in maize, and 
demonstrated the flexible partitioning of C4 acid decarboxylation activity between NADP-ME and PEP-CK in response 
to the environment. This study highlights the need to improve our understanding of the links between leaf 13δ and 
photosynthetic Δp, and the role of the secondary decarboxylase PEP-CK in NADP-ME plants such as maize.
Key words: C 4 photosynthesis, carbon isotope discrimination, leakiness, NADP-ME, PEP-CK, PEPC, Rubisco.
Introduction
C4 photosynthesis evolved as a spatial and biochemical adap-
tation to remedy the inefficiency of C 3 photosynthesis under 
conditions of high temperature, low CO 2, and water stress, 
all of which exacerbate photorespiration (Ludwig, 2013). The 
propensity of photorespiration is determined by the extent 
of oxygenation carried out by ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate 
carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) (Andrews et  al., 1973; 
Cleland et al., 1998). For C
3 plants, the current O 2 concen-
tration in the atmosphere (210 mmol mol –1) severely inhibits 
the carboxylation of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate by Rubisco. 
Together, these environmental conditions are hypothesized to 
be the drivers for the independent evolution of plants oper -
ating a CO
2 concentration mechanism (CCM; Sage et  al., 
2012). The distinguishing features of the CCM in most C 4

plants include the operation of two metabolic cycles (C 3 
and C4) across two photosynthetic cell types, mesophyll cells 
(MCs) and bundle-sheath cells (BSCs), which compartmen-
talize the initial carboxylation and decarboxylation reactions 
(Hatch, 1987; Langdale, 2011). The primary step of HCO
3
– 
fixation to phosphoenolpyruvate is catalysed by phospho-
enolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) to produce oxaloacetate, 
which is subsequently converted into C
4 acids within the 
MCs (Jenkins et al., 1987). These organic acids then diffuse 
into neighbouring BSCs where decarboxylation of C 4 acids 
releases CO2. A high CO2 concentration within the semi-gas-
tight BSCs suppresses photorespiration and enhances the 
capacity for CO
2 fixation by Rubisco. C4 photosynthesis has 
three biochemical subtypes depending on the C 4 decarboxy-
lase enzyme: nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate 
malic enzyme (NADP-ME), NAD malic enzyme, and phos-
phoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEP-CK) (Gutierrez et al., 
1974; Kanai and Edwards, 1999). C
4 plants have been clas-
sified into one of the three subtypes based on the dominant 
C
4 acid decarboxylation enzyme. Specialized leaf anatomy, 
biochemistry, and physiology are associated with each of the 
C
4 subtypes (Ghannoum et al., 2005, 2011).
Nevertheless, there is evidence emerging that PEP-CK 
activity is more widespread among the biochemical subtypes, 
suggesting that a degree of flexibility within the C
4 cycle 
may exist depending on species or environmental conditions 
(Leegood and Walker, 2003; Furbank, 2011). In maize, an 
NADP-ME C
4 grass, 25% of the oxaloacetate produced is 
cycled through an alternative pathway involving the aspar -
tate aminotransferase shuttle and the subsequent decarboxy-
lation of oxaloacetate within the cytosol of BSCs catalysed 
by PEP-CK (Wingler et al., 1999; Furbank, 2011). This has 
been shown to exist for maize and other C
4 grasses (Gutierrez 
et al., 1974). Therefore, the presence of alternative decarbox-
ylase pathways within maize provides the possibility for flexi-
bility in the use of the decarboxylation pathways of the CCM 
under certain growth conditions (Leegood and Walker, 2003).
For C
4 plants, there is an additional energetic cost associated 
with the operation and overcycling of the CCM. Minimally, 
an extra two ATP molecules per CO
2 fixed are required for 
the regeneration of PEP from pyruvate. During C4 photosyn-
thesis, the C4 cycle operates faster than the C 3 (Calvin) cycle 
in order to raise the BSC CO2 concentration and saturate the 
carboxylation reaction of Rubisco. Inevitably, a fraction of 
this CO
2 is not fixed by Rubisco and ultimately leaks back 
from the BSCs to the MCs. This fraction is termed leaki-
ness (ɸ) and entails additional energy costs associated with 
the overcycling of the C
4 cycle (Farquhar, 1983; Furbank 
et al., 1990). Consequently, the efficiency of C4 photosynthe-
sis requires the tight regulation of CO 2 supply with Rubisco 
activity within the BSCs in order to minimize leakiness and 
associated energy costs. This is often the case, given that leak-
iness varies within a narrow range and averages about 20% 
for a wide range of C
4 plants and environments (Henderson 
et al., 1992; von Caemmerer et al., 1997a; Cousins et al., 2008). 
Bundle-sheath leakiness can be estimated by concurrently 
measuring leaf gas exchange with carbon isotope discrimina-
tion (Evans et al., 1986). A number of studies have examined 
the effects of short-term and long-term changes in environ-
mental parameters, such as light, water stress, and salinity, 
yielding mixed results. A few studies have estimated leakiness 
from measurements of dry-matter carbon isotope, and found 
that leakiness was impacted by light, salinity, or water stress 
(Buchmann et al., 1996; Saliendra et al., 1996; Fravolinil et al., 
2002). When leakiness was estimated from carbon isotope 
discrimination measured during gas exchange, small changes 
in leakiness have been reported in some studies but not others 
in response to short- or long-term changes in the environment 
(Bowman et  al., 1989; Kubasek et  al., 2007). In particular, 
Bowman et al. (1989) found that leakiness changed diurnally 
in salt-stressed Zea mays and Andropogon glomeratus, two 
C
4, NADP-ME grasses, while Kubasek et al. (2007) reported 
that leakiness increased with low light and low temperature. 
Lowering light intensity during gas-exchange measurements 
had no effect on bundle-sheath leakiness in a number of C
4 
plants (Henderson et al., 1992), and leakiness was unchanged 
under long-term exposure to low light (Bellasio and Griffiths, 
2013a). Ubierna et al. (2013) found that the increase in leaki-
ness commonly reported at low light (Henderson et al., 1992) 
was only marginally present when using the full model for 
carbon isotope discrimination in C
4 leaves (Farquhar and 
Cernusak, 2012). Leakiness depends on a number of anatom-
ical (e.g. CO
2 diffusion path length, chloroplast position in the 
BSC, BSC wall conductance) and biochemical (e.g. activities 
of the carboxylases and decarboxylases during C
4 photosyn-
thesis) factors (Henderson et al., 1992; von Caemmerer and 
Furbank, 2003). In contrast to manipulations using trans-
genic C
4 plants (von Caemmerer et al., 1997b; Cousins et al., 
2006; Pengelly et al., 2012), few studies have investigated the 
effects of environmental variables on leakiness together with 
possible underlying biochemical mechanisms.
Consequently, the current study was aimed at investigat-
ing the efficiency of C
4 photosynthesis in maize exposed 
to long-term shade and salinity, by combining measure-
ments of leakiness with assays of the two carboxylases and 
decarboxylases known to operate in maize leaves. A second 
aim of this study was to probe the plasticity of the C
4 acid 
decarboxylases in response to these environmental vari-
ables. Salinity and shade were chosen because they impact 
on photosynthesis through contrasting effects on leaf CO
2 
diffusion and fixation. Mild to moderate salinity inhibits 
root water uptake, thus indirectly reducing the plant water 
status, as detected by increased leaf water potential and 
reduced stomatal conductance, both of which reduce pho-
tosynthesis (Munns and Tester, 2008; Omoto et al., 2012; 
Shabala and Munns, 2012). Low light reduces photosynthe-
sis mainly by reducing activity and activation of photosyn-
thetic enzymes (Edwards et al., 1985).
Materials and methods
Plant culture
Maize seeds (Sweet Corn, Kelvedon Glory 5713) were germinated in 
5 l pots (shaded plants were raised in 2 l pots) containing standard 
potting mix in a sunlit glasshouse during summer (December–March 
2012). Nutrients were supplied through the addition of Osmocote 
Maize photosynthesis under salinity and shade | 3717
and periodic watering with soluble Aquasol supplemented with 
magnesium sulfate. Maize plants destined for the salinity treatments 
were initially watered with tap water. Once seedlings were well estab-
lished (2 weeks after germination), NaCl was added at increasing 
concentrations to the watering solution over a period of 2 weeks 
until the endpoint concentrations of 50 and 100 mM NaCl were 
reached. To minimize NaCl accumulation, pots were flushed with 
water once a week, and then irrigated with the desired NaCl concen-
tration. Plants destined for shading were germinated as above in full 
sunlight and then placed under a shade cloth, which limited light to 
20% of the ambient sunlight. At midday, the photosynthetic active 
radiation of full sunlight ranged between 1000 and 1800  µmol m
–2 
s–1 when measured at pot level during the experiment. Air tempera-
ture inside the glasshouse compartment was regulated by a tempera-
ture-control system, and day/night temperatures averaged 26/18 °C. 
Relative humidity was monitored and ranged between 60 and 80% 
during the day. There were five pots per treatments. Plants were har-
vested 12 weeks after germination.
Measuring leaf gas exchange
Leaf gas-exchange measurements were carried out 1–2 weeks before 
harvest using a portable open photosynthesis system (LI-6400XT; 
LI-COR, Lincoln, USA). Measurements of light-saturated pho-
tosynthetic rate (A
sat) and stomatal conductance (g s) were taken 
between 10:00 and 14:00 at ambient CO2 (400 µl l–1), a leaf tempera-
ture of 26 °C, and a photosynthetic photon flux density of 1800 µmol 
m–2 s–1. Each leaf was allowed to reach a steady state of CO2 uptake 
in the LI-6400XT leaf chamber before measurements were taken.
Photosynthetic responses to intercellular CO2 concentration (A/Ci 
curves) were measured at 10 CO 2 steps using similar conditions as 
described above. The A/Ci curves were fitted using a C4 photosynthe-
sis model (von Caemmerer, 2000) to estimate maximal PEPC (in vivo 
V
pmax) and Rubisco (in vivo V cmax) activities. Vcmax and Vpmax were 
varied simultaneously until the best fit with the gas-exchange data 
was obtained.
Photosynthetic carbon isotope discrimination
Bundle-sheath leakiness was determined by measuring real-time 
13CO2/12CO2 carbon isotope discrimination using a gas exchange sys-
tem (LI-6400XT: LI-COR) attached to a tunable diode-laser (model 
TGA100; Campbell Scientific, Logan, UT, USA), under similar 
conditions to the spot gas exchange measurements. Photosynthetic 
discrimination against 
13C (Δp) was calculated using the following

ured with the tunable diode-laser. In this study, ξ ranged between 5 
and 11. Leakiness (ɸ) was calculated using the model of Farquhar 
(1983) as modified by Pengelly et al. (2010, 2012). The formulae used 
are described briefly below.

Rubisco content and soluble protein determination
Following gas-exchange measurements, replicate leaf discs (0.74 cm2) 
were rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at –80 °C until 
analysed. Each leaf disc was extracted in 1 ml of ice-cold extraction 
buffer [50 mM EPPS/NaOH (pH 8.0), 5 mM dithiothreitol, 20 mM 
NaHCO3, 20 mM MgCl2, 1 mM EDTA, 4% (v/v) Protease Inhibitor 
Cocktail (Sigma), and 1% (w/v) polyvinyl polypyrrolidone] using a 
2 ml Potter–Elvehjem glass homogenizer kept on ice. Subsamples 
were taken from the total extract for SDS-PAGE analysis (see below) 
of total leaf protein. The remaining extract was centrifuged at 16, 
100g for 1 min and the supernatant used for Rubisco and soluble 
protein assays. Rubisco content was estimated by the irreversible 
binding of [
14C]carboxyarabinitol bisphosphate (CABP) to the fully 
carbamylated enzyme (Sharwood et al., 2008). Extractable soluble 
proteins were measured using a Coomassie Plus kit (Pierce).
Activity of carboxylase and decarboxylase enzymes
Activity of Rubisco in maize extracts was determined by multiplying 
the number of Rubisco active sites determined using the [14C]CABP 
binding assay by the Rubisco in vitro kcat (5.5 s–1) determined using a 
14CO2 fixation assay (Sharwood et al., 2008). The activity of the PEPC 
3718 | Sharwood et al.
and NADP-ME enzymes were determined spectrophotometrically as 
described previously (Ashton et al., 1990; Pengelly et al., 2012).
The activity of PEP-CK in maize extracts was measured in the 
carboxylase direction using the method outlined by Walker et  al. 
(2002). For each assay, a separate leaf disc was homogenized in 
extraction buffer containing 50 mM HEPES (pH 7.2), 5 mM dithio-
threitol, 1% polyvinyl polypyrrolidone, 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM MnCl2, 
and 0.05% Triton X-100. MgCl 2 was not added to the extraction 
or assay buffer to remove the possibility of interference from other 
enzymes. PEP-CK activity was measured in assay buffer [100 mM 
HEPES (pH 7.0), 4% mercaptoethanol (w/v), 100 mM KCl, 90 mM 
NaHCO3, 1 mM ADP, 2 mM MnCl2, 0.14 mM NADH, and malate 
dehydrogenase (6 U)] after the addition of PEP to 5mM. The final 
concentration of 4 mM MnCl2 has been shown to be sufficient for 
PEP-CK activity (Chen et al., 2002; Walker et al., 2002).
SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis of Rubisco and CCM 
proteins
Subsamples of total protein fractions were mixed with 0.25 vols of 
4× LDS buffer (Invitrogen) containing 100 mM dithiothreitol and 
placed on ice until analysed within 2 h. For confirmatory visualiza-
tion, protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE in TGX Any 
kD (BioRad) pre-cast polyacrylamide gels buffered with 1× Tris/
glycine SDS buffer (BioRad) at 200 V using a Mini-Protean appa-
ratus at 4  °C. Proteins were visualized by staining with Bio-Safe 
Coomassie G-250 (BioRad) and imaged using a VersaDoc imaging 
system (BioRad).
For immunoblot analyses of total leaf protein, samples were 
separated by SDS-PAGE as outlined above and then transferred at 
4 °C to nitrocellulose membranes (0.45  µm; BioRad) using a Xcell 
Surelock western transfer module (Invitrogen) buffered with 1× 
transfer buffer [20×: 25 mM Bicine, 25 mM Bis/Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 
20% (v/v) methanol]. After 1 h transfer at 30 V , the membrane was 
placed in blocking solution [3% (w/v) skimmed milk powder in TBS, 
50 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8), 150 mM NaCl)] for 1 h at room temperature 
with gentle agitation.
Primary antisera raised in rabbit against tobacco Rubisco (pre-
pared by S. M. Whitney, Australian National University, Canberra, 
Australia) was diluted 1:4000 in TBS before incubation at 1 h with 
membranes at room temperature with gentle agitation. Antisera 
raised against PEPC was obtained from AgriSera and diluted 1:2000 
with TBS. For NADP-ME and PEP-CK, synthetic peptides based 
on monocot amino acid sequences for each protein were synthesized 
by GL Biochem and antisera were raised against each peptide in 
rabbits. The reactive antisera were the antigen purified for use in 
immunoblot analysis (GL Biochem). The NADP-ME and PEP-CK 
antisera were diluted in TBS at 1:1000 and 1:500, respectively.
All primary antisera were incubated with membranes at room 
temperature for 1 h with gentle agitation before washing three times 
with TBS. Secondary goat anti-rabbit antiserum conjugated to 
horseradish peroxidase (Perkin Elmer) was diluted 1:3000 in TBS 
and incubated with the membranes for 1 h at room temperature fol-
lowed by three washes with TBS. Immunoreactive peptides were 
detected using an Immun-Star WesternC kit (BioRad) and imaged 
using VersaDoc.
Plant biomass, leaf water potential, and nitrogen and carbon 
isotope composition
Before harvest, leaf water potential (Ψ
L) was measured on a cut, 
matching gas-exchange leaf using a Scholander-style pressure 
chamber (PMS Instrument Company, Corvallis, OR, USA). At 
harvest, leaves were sampled and their area determined using a leaf 
area meter (LI-3100A; LI-COR) and roots were washed free of 
soil. Plant tissues were oven dried at 80 °C for 48 h, weighed, and 
ground to a homogenous powder in a ball mill (MM-400; Retsch).
Leaf N content was determined on the ground tissue using a CN 
analyser (LECO TruSpec; LECO Corp., MI, USA). For carbon 
isotope composition (
13δ), ground leaf samples were combusted in a 
Carlo Erba elemental analyser (Model 1108) and the CO 2 was ana-
lysed by mass spectrometry. Isotopic composition (δ) was calculated 
as [(Rsample – R standard)/Rstandard]×1000, where Rsample and R standard are 
the 13C/12C ratios of the sample and standard (Pee Dee Belemnite), 
respectively.
Statistical analysis
Statistical significance tests were conducted using one-way analysis 
of variance computed in a general linear model. Treatment means 
were ranked using a post-hoc Tukey test.
Results
Plant growth and leaf nitrogen
Plant leaf area was reduced by 18 and 22% for plants exposed 
to 50 and 100 mM NaCl, respectively, whereas plant biomass 
was decreased by 34 and 50% for the same treatments when 
compared with the control (Fig. 1A, B, Table 1). Leaf mass 
per area was not significantly affected by salinity (Table 1).
The impact of 80% shading (shaded plants received 20% 
of ambient sunlight) on the maize plants was profound. 
Leaf area and total plant biomass were reduced to 18 and 
3% of that of the control plants, respectively, while leaf mass 
per area was reduced to 37% of that of the control plants 
(Fig. 1A, B, Table 1).
Leaf N content per unit mass decreased in the high-salt-
treated plants only relative to the control. When expressed on 
an areas basis, leaf N concentration tended to be lower in the 
shaded plants relative to the control (Table 1).
Leaf photosynthesis
Leaf water potential (Ψ L) decreased in plants exposed to 
moderate (100 mM NaCl) but not mild (50 mM NaCl) lev-
els of soil salinity (Table  1). Consequently, photosynthetic 
rates measured at ambient CO
2 (A sat) decreased in maize 
plants exposed to the higher salinity treatment only (Fig. 1C, 
Table 1), whereas gs decreased in plants exposed to both salin-
ity levels (Fig. 1D , Table 1). Plants exposed to shade under -
went larger decreases in photosynthesis and gs (Fig. 1C , D, 
Table  1). A  common linear relationship related A sat to g s 
(r2=0.73) in all the maize plants regardless of the treatment 
(Fig. 2C).
A/Ci curves were fitted using the C 4 photosynthesis model 
(von Caemmerer, 2000) to estimate in vivo V cmax and V pmax. 
Both parameters decreased in the shaded plants relative to the 
control, while there was a small but non-significant reduction 
in V
cmax in the higher salinity treatment. The ratio Vpmax/Vcmax 
(2.3–2.8) was similar for all the maize plants, regardless of the 
treatment (Fig. 3, Table 1).
Photosynthetic and dry-matter carbon isotope 
discrimination
Concurrent measurements of 13CO2/12CO2 discrimination and 
leaf gas exchange showed that photosynthetic discrimination 
(Δp) varied linearly with p i/pa for plants in the control and 
Maize photosynthesis under salinity and shade | 3719
salinity treatments, yielding a common bundle-sheath ɸ value 
of 0.25 according to the carbon discrimination model for C 4 
plants (Farquhar, 1983). Thus, salinity changed pi/pa without 
affecting ɸ. In contrast, shaded plants had lower Δp, pi/pa, and 
ɸ relative to both control and salt-stressed plants (Fig. 2A).
Leaf dry-matter carbon isotope composition ( 13δ) 
decreased (more negative) significantly in the salt-treated 
plants only, while shade plants had similar leaf 13δ to the con-
trol plants (Table 1). Photosynthetic Δp and leaf dry-matter 
13δ changed proportionately for the control and salt-treated

the common relationship because their photosynthetic Δ p 
decreased but not their leaf 13δ relative to the control plants 
(Fig. 2B).
Activity of photosynthetic enzymes
Leaf Rubisco content and Rubisco activity calculated from 
k
cat and the irreversible binding of the transition state ana-
logue [14C]CABP decreased by 25 and 50% in the salt-treated 
and shaded plants, respectively. As expected for C 4 leaves, 
Rubisco activity was equivalent to A sat for the control and 
shade leaves; this was not the case for the salt-treated leaves 
(Fig.  4A, Table  1). Leaf soluble proteins changed together 
with Rubisco such that Rubisco constituted a constant frac-
tion of soluble proteins under all treatments (Table 1). PEPC 
activity measured in leaf extracts was reduced by 80% in the 
shaded plants and by 30–50% in the salt-treated plants rela-
tive to the control treatment (Fig.  4B , Table  1). Generally, 
changes in Rubisco and PEPC activities were reflected by the 
immunoblots probed with antibodies raised against each of 
the carboxylase enzymes (Fig.  5). Shading reduced PEPC 
activity to a greater extent than Rubisco activity, and con-
sequently halved the PEPC/Rubisco activity ratio relative to 
the control treatment. The PEPC/Rubisco ratio was not sig-
nificantly affected by salinity in the maize plants (Table 1). It 
is worth noting that in vivo and in vitro estimates of Rubisco 
(V
cmax) and PEPC (V pmax) activities did not closely correlate 
in this study. Reconciling these parameters requires more 
detailed parameterization of C
4 photosynthesis model (von 
Caemmerer, 2000).
The activity of the primary decarboxylase NADP-ME 
and its relative content determined by immunoblot analy-
sis showed 35% reductions across both salinity treatments. 
NADP-ME activity declined by 60% in the shaded relative 
to the control plants (Figs 4C and 5, Table 1). Activity and 
protein expression of the secondary decarboxylase, PEP-CK, 
was detected in the leaf extracts of all maize plants (Figs 4D

and 5). In the control treatment, PEP-CK accounted for 20% 
of the total C 4 acid decarboxylation activity measured in 
maize leaves. This proportion increased to 30% in salt-treated 
plants and declined to 10% in the shaded plants (Table 1). In 
absolute terms, PEP-CK activity decreased by 40% in salt-
treated plants and by 75% in shaded plants (Figs 4D and 5, 
Table 1).
Discussion
Contrasting impacts of salinity and shade on maize
The main objective of this study was to investigate the reg-
ulation of C
4 photosynthesis subjected to environmental 
manipulations that are known to have contrasting impacts on 
the processes of CO
2 assimilation and diffusion. One of the 
main acclimation responses to shade is the downregulation of 
leaf photosynthetic capacity (Boardman, 1977). In contrast, 
mild to moderate salinity will primarily reduce stomatal con-
ductance by negatively impacting on soil, and hence on leaf 
water potential. Compared with water stress, salinity has the 
added advantage of providing a steady stress while avoiding 
the complications associated with controlling soil water sup-
ply (Neumann et al., 1988; Chaves et al., 2009). To this end, 
both treatments used in this study achieved their goals. While 
shade markedly reduced plant growth and photosynthetic 
capacity, salinity reduced stomatal conductance with small 
effects on photosynthetic rates of the maize plants. Salinity 
inhibited plant growth to a lesser extent than shade (Table 1).
The evolution of a CCM in higher plants represents a 
key step to improving photosynthesis under environmental 
conditions favouring photorespiration by circumventing the 
inefficiency of Rubisco. The efficient operation of C
4 photo-
synthesis requires close coordination between the C 4 and C3 
cycles, which is achieved through the distinct cellular com-
partmentalization of the initial and final carboxylases PEPC 
(in MCs) and Rubisco (in BSCs), respectively, as well as the 
localization of the decarboxylases (NADP-ME and PEP-CK 
for maize) within the BSC. In addition, the maintenance of a 
high PEPC/Rubisco activity ratio is critical for the build-up 
of CO
2 within the BSCs. Importantly, regulating the balance 
between Rubisco, PEPC, NADP-ME, and other enzymes 
of the C
3 and C4 cycles allows the dynamic regulation of C 4 
efficiency that other features such as BSC wall conductance 
or CO
2 diffusion path length cannot offer in the short to 
medium term (Hatch, 1987; von Caemmerer and Furbank, 
2003). Perturbation of the PEPC/Rubisco ratio by geneti-
cally suppressing PEPC results in C
4 plants unable to grow 
effectively in air (Dever et  al., 1997; Cousins et  al., 2007). 
Leakiness of CO 2 from the BSCs as determined from meas-
urements of 13C/12C carbon isotope discrimination represents 
a key surrogate indicator of the coordination between the C3 
and C4 cycles (Farquhar, 1983). Combining measurements of 
leakiness with activities of the key enzymes in the C 3 and C4 
cycles can elucidate the regulation and efficiency of C 4 pho-
tosynthesis under different environments (Evans et al., 1986; 
Henderson et al., 1992). Below, we demonstrate that shade, 
but not salinity, can perturb CCM efficiency as evidenced by 
changed leakiness.
Mild to moderate salinity impacts on carbon isotope 
discrimination through stomatal conductance without 
affecting leakiness
In maize, mild salinity (50 mM NaCl) reduced leaf g s but 
not Asat, while moderate salinity (100 mM NaCl) reduced 
both gs and A sat. Hence, reduced photosynthetic rates were 
largely caused by increased resistance to CO 2 diffusion 
under both salinity treatments, and this was born out in the 
lower pi/pa ratio and more negative dry-matter 13δ observed 
in the leaves of salt-treated maize plants (Fig. 2). Reduced 
stomatal conductance and leaf 
13δ in response to salinity 
is commonly reported in C 3 (Seemann and Critchley, 1985; 
Brugnoli and Lauteri, 1991) and C 4 (Bowman et al., 1989; 
Meinzer et  al., 1994; Meinzer and Zhu, 1999) plants. In 
maize, reduced photosynthetic rates, especially at the high-
est salinity treatment was also caused by the lower Rubisco 
and PEPC activities. This reduction was observed in the 
spectrophotometric assays and the immunodetection of the 
expressed proteins. Reduced expression of Rubisco under 
salinity was part of a general reduction in soluble proteins 
and leaf N. Leaf N is known to decline under salinity due 
to Cl
– interference with nitrate uptake by roots (Munns and 
Termaat, 1986).

100), or grown in 20% sunlight (shade).

The activity of both carboxylases declined to the same 
extent under salinity conditions such that the PEPC/Rubisco 
ratio was indistinguishable from that of the control leaves. 
This may explain why leakiness was unaffected by salinity 
in maize leaves despite the changes in photosynthetic Δ
p and 
leaf 13δ, which were caused by reduced p i/pa (Fig. 2). In line 
with these results, when the C 4 shrub Atriplex lentiformis 
was exposed for 4 weeks to salinity levels equivalent to those 
used in the current study, photosynthesis and stomatal con-
ductance decreased, while the PEPC/Rubisco ratio remained 
unchanged until the salinity increased above 120 mM. The 
same study also reported that leakiness, estimated from leaf 
13δ rather than from photosynthetic Δp, correlated positively 
with the PEPC/Rubisco ratio (Meinzer and Zhu, 1999). 
Similarly to Atriplex, salinity reduced photosynthesis and 
increased p
i/pa and ɸ values in sugarcane genotypes. Changes 
in ɸ derived from leaf 13δ were also related to the PEPC/
Rubisco ratio in sugarcane (Meinzer et al., 1994).
The discrepancy between the studies using Atriplex and 
sugarcane with the current study using maize may be related 
to a number of factors, the main ones being the salinity level 
and the basis for leakiness calculation. Meinzer and Zhu 
(1999) found that mild salinity mainly affected g
s and had little 
impacts on ɸ (a similar scenario to the current maize study), 
and that ɸ and the PEPC/Rubisco ratio were affected at high 
salinity, indicating profound damage of the photosynthetic 
apparatus by the accumulating salt, unlike the treatments 
used in the current maize study. In addition, the difference 
between leaf 
13δ and photosynthetic Δ p have not been rec-
onciled yet for C 4 plants. Post-photosynthetic fractionation 
of 13C/12C may be important in C4 leaves, thus representing a 
source of uncertainty in leakiness calculations based on leaf 
13δ (Henderson et al., 1992).
In maize, both salinity treatments reduced the activ-
ity of the primary (NADP-ME) and secondary (PEP-CK) 
decarboxylases. These observations, together with reduced 
PEPC activity, suggest that the CCM was down regulated in 
response to salinity. Results obtained with enzyme activity 
and immunoblot analysis indicated that the decarboxylases 
were inhibited more than the carboxylases under salin-
ity. Evidence from transgenic Flaveria plants with reduced 
amounts of NADP-ME have indicated that this decar -
boxylase is in excess, as photosynthesis was not impacted 
until activity was reduced to less than 40% of that of wild 
type (Pengelly et al., 2012). In summary, salinity treatments 
reduced photosynthesis primarily by reducing g
s and second-
arily by reducing Rubisco and PEPC activities. The balance 
between the C
3 and C4 cycles was unaffected, as indicated by 
a similar leakiness between the salt-treated and control maize 
plants.
Shade profoundly reduces photosynthetic capacity 
and leakiness, thus perturbing the coordination 
between the C3 and C4 cycles
The shade treatment used in this study had profound impacts 
on the growth and photosynthesis of the maize plants 
(Table  1). In particular, shade reduced the photosynthetic 
capacity measured in terms of in vivo V
cmax and V pmax esti-
mated from the A/C i curves and in terms of enzyme activ-
ity of the carboxylases and decarboxylases. In contrast to 
salinity, shade had two significantly distinct effects on leaf 
photosynthesis. Firstly, decreased photosynthetic capacity 
was mediated by a general downregulation of the activity and 
protein expression of all measured photosynthetic enzymes. 
Secondly, the PEPC/Rubisco ratio, photosynthetic Δ
p, and its 
derived leakiness decreased relative to those of the control 
plants, while leaf 
13δ was not significantly affected (Fig. 2).
The responses of C 4 photosynthesis to low light vary 
depending on whether the condition is transient or a short-
term acclimation. Under low light (<200  µmol quanta m
–2 
s–1), ɸ may increase, possibly as a result of decreased Rubisco 
activation or increased Rubisco oxygenation due to the low 
BSC CO
2 concentration. These factors decrease CO2 fixation 
by Rubisco more than by PEPC, thus maintaining a higher 
supply of CO
2 to the BSCs than Rubisco can fix (Henderson 
et al., 1992; Kromdijk et al., 2008, 2010; Tazoe et al., 2008). 
However, ɸ in maize leaves was unaffected under conditions

antisera raised against the four photosynthetic enzymes Rubisco large subunit, PEPC, NADP-ME, and PEP-CK, as described in Materials and methods. 
The analysis was undertaken separately for the salinity-treated (A) and shade-treated (B) maize plants. Changes in immunoblot densitometry were 
calculated relative to the control treatment (C).

of short-term acclimation to low light (Bellasio and Griffiths, 
2013a, b).
In contrast to these studies, leakiness decreased in our 
study as a result of reduced Δ p with little impact on p i/pa, 
suggesting two main conclusions. Firstly, reduced leakiness 
in our maize study was accompanied by a reduced PEPC/
Rubisco ratio, highlighting the role of this ratio in particular, 
and the balance between the activity of the C
3 and C 4 cycle 
enzymes in general, for optimizing the efficiency of C4 photo-
synthesis. Our results in maize make it clear that acclimation 
to low light reduced PEPC activity and protein expression to 
a greater extent than those of Rubisco. High light depend-
ence of PEPC gene expression is well documented in C
4 
plants (Chollet et  al., 1996). Secondly, leaf 13δ and pho-
tosynthetic Δp in our maize study did not change together 
under low light, mainly because the former decreased while 
the latter was only marginally and not significantly affected 
by shade (Fig. 2). This is in contrast to a large survey of C
4 
grasses, showing that leaf 13δ decreased under shade condi-
tions (Buchmann et al., 1996). On the one hand, our results 
highlight the problems of using leaf 13δ as a proxy for pho-
tosynthetic Δp, especially when inferring leakiness and C 4 
regulation. On the other hand, our results point to a stronger 
dependence of leaf 
13δ on the diffusive components (salinity 
effects) within the Δ p equation as opposed to the metabolic 
factors for which light can have complex effects (Farquhar, 
1983; Henderson et al., 1992; von Caemmerer et al., 1997a; 
Ubierna et al., 2011). Solving the link between leaf 
13δ and 
photosynthetic Δp remains a key challenge for elucidating the 
underpinnings of carbon isotope discrimination in C4 leaves.
In another contrast with the salinity treatments, shade 
reduced the activity of the primary decarboxylase NADP-ME 
less, while strongly suppressing the activity of the secondary 
decarboxylase PEP-CK. Taken together, these results con-
stitute rare evidence for decarboxylase flexibility in response 
to environmental conditions, with salinity and shade hav-
ing opposite effects on the ratio of PEP-CK to NADP-ME 
activity in maize. It is unlikely that the observed changes in 
NADP-ME and PEP-CK were due to anaplerotic activities 
due to their low contribution relative to that of the photo-
synthetic isoforms (Drincovich et al., 2001). The differential 
engagement of the decarboxylation pathways enables C
4 
plants to acclimate to varying conditions of light (Furbank, 
2011). For example, it has been shown that the flexible opera-
tion of NADP-ME and PEP-CK decarboxylases in maize 
allows the bundle sheath to regulate NADPH supply under 
variable light conditions (Bellasio and Griffiths, 2013b). In 
the current study, we demonstrated the differential engage-
ment of the primary and secondary decarboxylases under 
long-term acclimation to low light through the significant 
reductions of PEP-CK activity and protein content (Figs 4 
and 5).
In summary, we demonstrated that long-term acclimation 
to low light in maize causes a reduction in BSC leakiness. This 
reduction was underpinned by a greater downregulation of 
PEPC activity and content relative to those of Rubisco, and 
by a flexible partitioning of C
4 acid decarboxylation activity 
between NADP-ME and PEP-CK.
