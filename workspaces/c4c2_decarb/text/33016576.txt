Summary
Introduction of a C4 photosynthetic mechanism into C3 crops offers an opportunity to improve
photosynthetic efﬁciency, biomass and yield in addition to potentially improving nitrogen and
water use efﬁciency. To create a two-cell metabolic prototype for an NADP-malic enzyme type
C4 rice, we transformedOryza sativa spp. japonica cultivar Kitaake with a single construct
containing the coding regions of carbonic anhydrase, phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) carboxylase,
NADP-malate dehydrogenase, pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase and NADP-malic enzyme from
Zea mays, driven by cell-preferential promoters. Gene expression, protein accumulation and
enzyme activity were conﬁrmed for all ﬁve transgenes, and intercellular localization of proteins
was analysed. 13CO2 labelling demonstrated a 10-fold increase in ﬂux though PEP carboxylase,
exceeding the increase in measuredin vitro enzyme activity, and estimated to be about 2% of
the maize photosynthetic ﬂux. Flux from malate via pyruvate to PEP remained low,
commensurate with the low NADP-malic enzyme activity observed in the transgenic lines.
Physiological perturbations were minor and RNA sequencing revealed no substantive effects of
transgene expression on other endogenous rice transcripts associated with photosynthesis. These
results provide promise that, with enhanced levels of the C4 proteins introduced thus far, a
functional C4 pathway is achievable in rice.
Introduction
Installation of a C4 photosynthetic pathway in rice has been
predicted to increase rice yields by up to 50% (Hibberdet al.,
2008) and has been the focus of a large international consortium
for more than a decade (https://c4rice.com/; von Caemmerer
et al., 2012; Ermakovaet al., 2020). Whereas a full compendium
of genes required to engineer anatomical specialization for a full
two-cell C4 pathway in rice is still a way off, the genes and
promoter sequences required for a metabolic prototype are
currently available (Ermakovaet al., 2020). An obstacle thus far in
developing a metabolic prototype has been the difﬁculty of
genotype engineering wherein multiple genes originating from
distinct single gene transgenics are crossed to assemble a
complete metabolic pathway (Karki et al ., 2020). This has
required screening of thousands of individuals across the initial
transgenic generation stage and through multiple rounds of
crosses to track the presence of all transgenes and conﬁrm their
expression in the appropriate cell-type in segregating material
(Karki et al., 2020; Linet al., 2020). Modular cloning technologies
such as Golden Gate (Engleret al., 2014) offer the opportunity to
introduce a full suite of C4 enzymes into rice on a single construct,
simplifying generation of lines and minimizing the potential for
deleterious effects arising from transgene insertion.
Introduction of full C4 biochemistry into a C3 plant will require
signiﬁcant changes to chloroplast proteomes of mesophyll (M)
and bundle sheath (BS) cells (Hern /C19andez-Prieto et al., 2019;
Majeran and van Wijk, 2009), but a minimal C4 cycle could be
built by introducing just ﬁve enzymes fromZea mays(maize) into
speciﬁc cells and compartments of the rice leaf (Ermakovaet al.,
2020; Karki et al., 2020). In this scenario, carbonic anhydrase
(CA) and PEP carboxylase (PEPC) in the cytosol of M cells convert
CO2 into bicarbonate and ﬁx it into oxaloacetate. NADP-malate
dehydrogenase (MDH) inside the mesophyll chloroplasts then
converts oxaloacetate into malate using NADPH produced by
photosynthetic electron transport. After malate diffuses into BS
cells, it is decarboxylated inside the chloroplast by NADP-
dependent malic enzyme (NADP-ME). The released CO2 is reﬁxed
by ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase oxygenase (Rubisco)
and the residual pyruvate diffuses back to M cells to be
regenerated into PEP by pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK)
inside the chloroplast. Individually, expression of these enzymes

does not affect plant ﬁtness or photosynthetic function (Karki
et al., 2020). However, collectively this minimal cycle would
contribute to establishing higher CO2 partial pressure around
Rubisco in BS cells and could be beneﬁcial even in plants with C3
leaf anatomy (Ermakovaet al., 2020).
Previous attempts to introduce C4 metabolism into C3 species
were focused primarily on using maize enzymes to replicate the
single cell type C4 pathway that is found in species such as
Hydrilla verticillata (Miyao et al., 2011). Stacking of four maize
genes was achieved by crossing individual rice lines transformed
with single genes of interest or by multiple re-transformation of
transgenic lines with additional gene constructs (Taniguchiet al.,
2008). Although extractable activity of C4 cycle enzymes was
unambiguously demonstrated in vitro for both single and
multigene rice transgenics (Fukayama et al., 2001; Karki et al.,
2020; Ku et al., 1999; Taniguchi et al., 2008; Tsuchida et al.,
2001), expression of maize PEPC did not result in any 14C
incorporation into C4 acids in vivo (Fukayama et al., 2003) and
reports conﬁrming C4 metabolic function using isotopic labelling
(Arrivault et al., 2016; Hatch and Slack, 1966) have so far been
missing.
Here we express ﬁve enzymes required to form a minimal
NADP-ME C4 cycle in appropriate cell types with the correct
subcellular compartment in rice using a single construct.13CO2
labelling and metabolomics revealedin vivoincorporation of CO2
into C4 acids (C4-carboxylation) but no evidence of subsequent
decarboxylation, indicating that the C4 cycle is partially func-
tional. We show that physiological consequences of C4-carboxy-
lation in rice are minor with limited perturbation to
photosynthetic light induction and no substantive effects on the
global leaf transcriptome. Our results demonstrate that expres-
sion of a multigene construct is feasible in rice and provides a
basis for the establishment of a C
4 cycle in C3 species.
Results
A single construct for expression of ﬁve C4 enzyme
transgenes
The coding sequences of ﬁve Z. mays genes encoding core
enzymes of the C4 cycle were assembled in a single construct
using the Golden Gate cloning system (see Materials and
Methods; Engleret al., 2014).PEPC promoters from four different
C4 grass species were used to drive M-preferential gene expres-
sion, and the glycine decarboxylase P-protein (GLDP) promoter
from Flaveria trinervia was used for BS-preferential expression
(Engelmann et al., 2008; Gupta et al., 2020). The nucleotide
sequence of the baculovirus envelope gp64 protein (AcV5 tag;
Lawrence et al., 2003) was added as a tag to the N-terminal end
of ZmCA to aid in its detection in planta. Constructs were
transformed into O. sativa spp. japonica cultivar Kitaake using
stable agrobacterium-mediated transformation and either hygro-
mycin or bialaphos as selective agents. Two hygromycin-resistant
T
0 plants (lines 1 and 29) and one bialaphos-resistant T0 plant (line
B6) were selected for further analysis based on the presence of
transcripts from all ﬁveZ. mays transgenes. Homozygous plants
of the three selected lines were identiﬁed in the T1 progeny, and
seeds originating from those plants were used in all further
experiments.
Expression, activity and localization of the C4 enzymes
Transgene transcript abundance was analysed by RNA sequenc-
ing. Figure 1a reveals some variation in transgene expression
between the lines with line 1 having the highest levels ofZmCA
transcripts but about two-fold lower levels ofZmMDH transcripts
in comparison with lines 29 and B6. Across all three transgenic
lines, ZmCA transcript abundance was highest, followed by
ZmMDH, ZmPPDK, ZmPEPC and ZmNADP-ME, withZmNADP-ME
transcripts detectable above background only in lines 29 and B6.
Transcript abundance of the endogenous rice orthologs of theZ.
mays transgenes did not change in response to transgene
expression in the three transgenic lines.
Accumulation of C
4 enzymes was conﬁrmed by immunoblot-
ting of leaf protein extracts (Figure 1b). When compared to wild-
type (WT) plants, all transgenic lines accumulated higher levels of
PEPC, MDH and PPDK. These abundances correspond to 20-60%
of levels inZ. mays (per leaf area) for MDH and 3-5% for PEPC
and PPDK. Consistent with the transcript abundance data, CA
protein abundance was also highest in line 1. NADP-ME protein
was only just detectable in lines B6 and 29 and not detectable in
line 1. In accordance with protein abundance, enzyme assays
demonstrated signiﬁcantly increased activities of PEPC, MDH and
PPDK compared to WT in all three transgenic lines whereas
NADP-ME activity was only higher in lines B6 and 29 (Table 1).
PEPC, MDH, NADP-ME and PPDK activities were increased by up
to three-fold, 13-fold, 15-fold and seven-fold compared to WT,
reaching values that were up to 2%, 47%, 2% and 10% of those
reported in maize, respectively. No increase in CA activity was
detected in transgenic lines, likely due to the high-activity levels of
the endogenous chloroplast-targeted CA isoform present in WT
rice. Rubisco activity, chlorophyll content and leaf dry weight
were all unaltered compared to WT (Table 1) and no growth
phenotype was observed in the transgenic plants.
To determine whether the C
4 enzymes accumulated in the
correct cellular compartment, immunolocalization was performed
with speciﬁc antibodies against theZ. mays enzymes or, in the
case of CA, the AcV5 tag, using thin leaf cross-sections and laser
confocal microscopy (Figure 1c, Figure S1, Table S1). PEPC was
correctly compartmentalized in the cytosol of M cells in lines 29
and B6 but was also present in BS cells in line 1; MDH was present
in both cell-types in all three lines rather than being M cell-
speciﬁc, as it would in a C
4 plant; CA-AcV5 was correctly
localized to M cells in line 29 but was in both cell-types in the
other two lines; and NADP-ME could not be detected in any of
the lines. PPDK accumulated in both cell-types in all three
transgenic lines, as it does in maize (Majeranet al., 2005). Given
these accumulation patterns, we predicted that carboxylation by
PEPC would be possible in M cells of all three lines, as would
conversion of oxaloacetate to malate by MDH. Metabolic
consequences beyond those steps could not be predicted, but
the inability to detect NADP-ME in BS cells of the transgenic lines
suggested that decarboxylation of malate was unlikely to occur.
Detection of C4-carboxylation
13CO2 labelling experiments were performed to assess whether
there was any C4 pathway ﬂux in transgenic lines. Leaves from
WT and transgenic plants were supplied with 13CO2 under
ambient growth conditions using a custom-designed labelling
chamber (Figure S2; see Method S2). Isotopomers of C
4 pathway
intermediates and Calvin–Benson cycle (CBC) intermediates were
quantiﬁed by reverse-phase liquid chromatography, coupled to
tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), after both
13CO2-pulse
and 13CO2-pulse/12CO2 chase labelling experiments.
When WT plants were pulse-labelled with13CO2, 13C enrich-
ment rose rapidly in 3-phosphoglycerate (3PGA) and other CBC

intermediates - dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and ribu-
lose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) - (up to 90%13C enrichment after
600 s), and almost as rapidly in the photorespiratory intermediate
2-phosphoglycolate (2PG), but there was little
13C enrichment in
C4 acids, malate and aspartate (Figure 2; Figure S3). These
labelling patterns are typical for C3 species, as shown previously in
Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum)
and cassava (Manihot esculenta) (Arrivault et al., 2019; Hasu-
numa et al., 2009; Maet al., 2014; Szecowkaet al., 2013). By
contrast, 13C enrichment of malate rose faster in the three
transgenic rice lines than in WT (Figure 2), with the m1
isotopomer as well as them2 and m3 isotopomers being more
abundant than in WT (Figure 3). Line 29 had the highest13C
enrichment in malate (Figure 2, Figure 3). Similar results were
observed for aspartate where line B6 had the highest enrichment
(Figure 2, Figure 3). Calculation of 13C enrichment half times
conﬁrmed the faster rise in 13C enrichment of malate and
aspartate in all three transgenic lines (Table S2).

net 13C accumulation plotted against 13C-pulse labelling time,

Partial C4 cycle in rice using a single construct577
provided a proxy for minimum13C ﬂuxes (Figure S4; Data S1).13C
accumulation rates were similar in the three transgenic lines and
approximatively 10-fold higher than in WT for malate and three-
fold higher for aspartate (Table S3). The summed rates of
13C
accumulation in malate and aspartate in the transgenic lines were
equivalent to up to 330 nmol13C equivalents g-1 FW h-1, which is
about 1.7% of a typical photosynthesis rate in maize under
similar conditions (~190 µmol CO2 g-1 FW h-1) (Arrivault et al.,
2016). Moreover, total measured metabolite pool sizes indicated
that all three transgenic lines had signiﬁcantly more malate (up to
50%) and less aspartate than the WT (Figure S5; Table S4).
The kinetics of
13C enrichment in PEP and 3PGA differs
between C3 and C4 plants (Arrivaultet al., 2019; Arrivaultet al.,
2016) and the ratio of [13C enrichment in PEP]: [13C enrichment in
3PGA], termed hereafter the PEP:3PGA enrichment ratio, can
provide evidence for the operation of C
4 cycle (Figure S6). In WT
rice the enrichment rose more slowly in PEP than 3PGA, similar to
cassava (Arrivaultet al., 2019). In maize, enrichment rose slower
in PEP than 3PGA (data from (Arrivaultet al., 2016) is replotted in
Figure S6) reﬂecting a large ﬂux of unlabelled C from C4 cycle
intermediates into PEP (see legend of Figure S6). The kinetics of
the PEP:3PGA enrichment ratio in the three transgenic rice lines
broadly resembled that of WT rice, suggesting that PEP was
mostly labelled from 3PGA via the reversible reactions catalysed
by phosphoglyceromutase and enolase (Furbank and Leegood,
1984). However, the enrichment ratio was slightly lower at the
ﬁrst time points suggesting the operation of C
4 cycle at a low
level (Figure S6, signiﬁcant for lines B6 and 29). Calculation of13C
enrichment half times conﬁrmed the slightly slower rise in
enrichment in PEP in lines B6 and 29 compared to WT rice
(Table S2).
No consistent evidence of loss of label from malate or aspartate
in the transgenic lines and no increase in
13C labelling of 3PGA or
other CBC intermediates were found during the pulse/chase
labelling (Figures S7 and S8). These results were corroborated by
the pulse labelling kinetics and the rates of
13C accumulation in
RuBP, DHAP, pyruvate and 2PG that were broadly similar
between the transgenic and WT plants (Figure 2, Figure S9).
The transgenic lines had more PEP and RuBP than the WT plants,
but there were no signiﬁcant differences in 3PGA, DHAP,
pyruvate and 2PG content (Figure S5, Table S4). Movement of
the
13C label to the citric acid cycle in mitochondria was evident
from the 13C labelling of citrate being readily detectable in the
three transgenic lines but not in WT rice (Figure 2, Figure S9).
Calculation of half times conﬁrmed the faster rise in 13C
enrichment of citrate in all three transgenic lines (Table S2). This
enrichment was low in percentage terms and no signiﬁcant
differences in total citrate amount were detected (Figure S5,
Table S4).
Effects of enhanced C4-carboxylation on C3
photosynthesis
To determine whether the altered metabolism observed in
transgenic lines had a ﬁtness cost, we carried out comprehensive
gas-exchange and ﬂuorescence analysis. At steady-state, when
leaves were adapted to photosynthetic photon ﬂux density (PPFD)
of 1500 µmol m
-2 s-1, no signiﬁcant differences in net CO 2
assimilation rate, stomatal conductance to H 2O or the ratio
between intercellular and ambientpCO2 were detected between
the transgenic lines and WT (Table 2). The response of CO 2
assimilation rate, stomatal conductance and Photosystem II (PSII)
electron transport rate (ETR) to varying intercellularpCO2 for the
three transgenic lines were similarly not signiﬁcantly different
from WT (Figure 4a), nor were the maximum carboxylation rate
of Rubisco or the rate of photosynthetic electron transport
(Table 2). The rate of respiration in the dark was not affected in
the transgenic rice lines (Table 2).
Since engagement of the C
4 cycle in transgenic rice was
predicted to inﬂuence the CO2 compensation point (Ermakova
et al ., 2020), this parameter was determined at different
atmospheric O2 levels (Figure 4b). At pO2 between 1.9 and
20 kPa, the CO2 compensation points of transgenic lines did not
differ from WT. However, atpO2 of 28.6 kPa, above the ambient
level, lines B6 and 29 had a signiﬁcantly higher CO2 compensa-
tion point compared to WT rice and line 1 (Figure 4b). In addition,
the maximal dark-adapted quantum efﬁciency of PSII, which is
often decreased in plants subjected to various stresses (Murchie
and Lawson, 2013), was signiﬁcantly lower in line B6 (Table 2).

These results pointed to a potentially lower resilience of the
transgenic plants to stress conditions.
To further explore these effects, we studied the induction of
photosynthesis over the ﬁrst 20 min of illumination on plants
grown under normal (400 µmol photons m /C02 s/C01) and low
irradiance (200 µmol photons m/C02 s/C01). No signiﬁcant differ-
ences in CO2 assimilation rate, stomatal conductance,ΦPSII (the
effective quantum yield of PSII) and non-photochemical quench-
ing (NPQ, a measure of the absorbed light energy that is actively
dissipated as heat in the PSII antennae) were found between the
plants grown under normal light (Figure S10). However, when
grown at a lower irradiance, all three transgenic lines had a
slower induction of CO
2 assimilation rate and stomatal conduc-
tance during the ﬁrst 5 min of illumination (Figure 5). After
10 min of illumination, lines B6 and 29 still showed reduced CO2
assimilation rates whereas after 15 min neither of the transgenic
lines differed from WT. Stomatal conductance in plants of line 29
was still lower than in WT after 15 min of illumination but after
20 min this difference was greatly diminished (Figure 5). Impor-
tantly, the ratio of intercellular and ambientpCO
2 did not differ
between the lines and WT indicating that stomatal conductance
did not impose direct limitations to the assimilation rate.
Although differences in ΦPSII were not signiﬁcant, NPQ was
signiﬁcantly higher in all three transgenic lines after 5 min of
illumination and in line B6 NPQ remained signiﬁcantly higher also
after 20 min of induction (Figure 5).
Differentially regulated genes
Given that overexpression of functional C4 enzymes, and the
concomitant establishment of C4-carboxylation, produced mini-
mal effects on the physiological response of the C 3 leaf we
sought to determine whether the lack of phenotypic response
was attributable to compensatory mechanisms arising through
altered gene expression. In addition, we investigated whether

intercellular and ambient pCO2 (Ci/Ca), net CO2 assimilation rates (A) and stomatal conductance to H2O( gs_H2O) were determined in steady-state conditions at
1500 µmol m-2 s-1 PPFD and Ca = 37 Pa. Maximum carboxylation rate allowed by Rubisco (Vcmax), rate of photosynthetic electron transport based on NADPH
requirement (J), and triose phosphate use (TPU) were determined by ﬁtting the A-Ci response curves (Figure 4a). Mean/C6SE, n = 5 biological replicates for WT,n = 4
otherwise. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey’spost hoctest, letters indicate signiﬁcant differences between the groups (a > 0.05).

alteration of the expression of genes encoding enzymes or
transporters in related biochemical pathways might help to
explain the lack of a phenotypic perturbation or provide insight
into why a fully operational C
4 cycle was not established. To
address these questions, WT and transgenic plants were subject
to transcriptome sequencing and differential expression analysis.
In total, only 58 genes (0.2% of all genes) were consistently
differentially expressed when transgenic lines were compared to
WT control (Figure S11). Thus, the transcriptome phenotype is
minimally perturbed, mirroring the subtle physiological pheno-
type. Although several genes that are differentially expressed lack
functional annotations, none of the detected genes with func-
tional annotations encode proteins that are known to transport or
convert metabolites of the core C
4 cycle. Thus, compensatory
changes to the transcriptome that could divert malate from being
decarboxylated in BS chloroplast did not occur.
Although changes to the expression of genes encoding C
4
cycle-related enzymes and transporters were not detected, shared
changes in gene expression of several photosynthesises-related
genes were observed (Table S5). These include genes whose
products function in the regulation of stomatal movement,
photomorphogenesis, the circadian clock, thioredoxin(-like) genes
and multiple genes involved in the production of xanthophyll.
Collectively these may contribute to the moderate effect on CO
2
assimilation that was observed. Moreover, it is noteworthy that
the rice ortholog of the Arabidopsis gene PROTEIN DISULFIDE
ISOMERASE 6, which is an attenuator of D1 protein synthesis
facilitating photoinhibition in response to high light (Wittenberg
et al., 2014), is upregulated in the transgenic lines. Enhanced
susceptibility to photoinhibition may also help to explain the
enhanced NPQ and slightly decreased maximum PSII efﬁciency
observed in the transgenic lines.
Discussion
Multiple C4 enzymes can be functionally expressed in
rice from a single construct
Engineering C4 photosynthesis into C3 plants is proposed to be a
major way to increase radiation, nitrogen and water-use efﬁcien-
cies and consequently crop yield (Hibberdet al., 2008; Schuler
et al., 2016). In this study, we used a single construct to introduce
ﬁve enzymes of the C
4 pathway into rice, exploiting previously
reported cell-preferential promoters to drive expression of maize
cDNA sequences (Engelmann et al., 2008; Gupta et al., 2020).
Less than half of the screened events showed expression of all ﬁve
transgenes (Figure S12), possibly due to deletion of key regulatory
elements by recombination events either in agrobacteria or

Partial C4 cycle in rice using a single construct581
during the T-DNA integration. Protein levels (Figure 1b) and
extractable enzyme activity (Table 1) in homozygous segregants
from three independent homozygous lines reﬂected relative
transcript levels (Figure 1a) and were consistent with previous
reports of expression from cDNAs encoding C
4 enzymes
(Fukayama et al., 2001; Taniguchiet al., 2008). However, protein
levels were substantively lower than those seen when genomic
gene sequences were expressed in rice (Miyao et al., 2011)
suggesting that intron sequences or other untranslated regions
may elevate levels of transcripts, and hence protein, in the
context of the rice leaf. In addition, considerable variation in gene
and protein expression between the three transgenic lines
demonstrated that genomic context and selective down-regula-
tion of some transgenes in the T-DNA may affect expression
patterns.
Of the ﬁve C
4 enzymes, NADP-ME showed the least consistent
and lowest protein accumulation levels in all three transgenic
lines. The NADP-ME cDNA sequence was driven by the GLDP
promoter shown to be active in bundle sheath and vascular cells
(Engelmann et al., 2008). Although the strength of this promoter
relative to the M-preferentialPEPC promoter is unknown, line B6
did have appreciableNADP-ME expression at the transcript level,
detectable NADP-ME protein by immunoblotting, and an almost
seven-fold increase in enzyme activity above the albeit very low
basal value in WT (Figure 1, Table 1). However, the level of
increased activity was insufﬁcient to detect decarboxylation of
malate in vivo.
Operation of a partial C4 cycle in rice
Labelling of C4 acids—malate and aspartate—was consistently
higher in the three independent transgenic lines than in WT rice
plants (Figure 2, Figure 3), indicating substantially increased
ﬁxation of CO
2 by PEPC in lines expressing the Z. mays PEPC
enzyme. Rates of13C accumulation in malate were similar in the
three transgenic lines and approximatively 10-fold higher than in
WT (Table S3). This increase in estimated ﬂux was larger than the
2.5- to three-fold increase in PEPC activity and resembled the
10-fold increase in MDH expression in these lines (Table 1). This
over-proportional increase in ﬂux indicates thatZ. maysPEPC can
operate efﬁciently in vivo in rice, perhaps more efﬁciently than
the endogenous rice PEPC due to the altered kinetic properties of
the C
4 enzyme, that is, insensitivity to inhibition by post-
translational modiﬁcation and product-inhibition by malate (Endo
et al., 2008). Nonetheless, the estimated ﬂux at PEPC in the
transgenic rice lines was only about 2% of that required during

photosynthesis in maize and thus corresponding to thein vitro
PEPC activity (Table 1). Thus, a considerably larger increase in
PEPC expression will likely be required to establish C
4 photosyn-
thesis in rice.
The pulse-chase experiments provided no compelling evidence
for C4 acid decarboxylation by the introducedZ. maysNADP-ME
or for re-ﬁxation of CO2 into CBC intermediates in the transgenic
lines. It should be noted that the13CO2 pulse was kept short
(30 s) so that them1 isotopomers of malate and aspartate were
the most abundant labelled isotopomers (Hatch, 1971). With
such a short pulse, 13C enrichments for malate and aspartate
were less than 2% in the transgenic lines and likely too low to
detect their decarboxylation. Another confounding factor is that
there was already substantial labelling of the CBC intermediates
by the end of the 30 s pulse (around 30%), so movement of
13C
from the weakly labelled pools of C4 acids into CBC intermediates
would have been difﬁcult to detect above this background.
However, a slight delay in labelling of PEP in the transgenic lines,
potentially caused by a ﬂux of unlabelled C from pyruvate into
PEP at early times during a pulse (Figure S6, see also Arrivault
et al., 2016; Hatch, 1971; Hatch and Slack, 1966), indicated that
aC
4 cycle may be operating, albeit at very low rates. This label
disequilibrium between 3PGA and PEP may provide a proxy for
ﬂux around the C4 cycle, as suggested by the signiﬁcant changes
in lines B6 and 29, which had the largest increase in NADP-ME
activity. Consistently higher
13C labelling of citrate in all three
transgenic lines (Figure 2, Figure S9) could be explained by
movement of 13C-labelled C4 acids (malate, oxaloacetate or
fumarate) from the cytosol into the mitochondria and the citric
acid cycle. Although small in absolute terms, entry of organic
acids into the citric acid cycle could lead to futile cycling of C
4
acids and have an adverse impact on operation of a photosyn-
thetic C4 cycle.
C4-carboxylation has minimal effects on C3 leaf ﬁtness
Previous studies examining physiological phenotypes in rice
overexpressing individual enzymes of the C4 cycle have struggled
to ﬁnd effects (Giulianiet al., 2019; Miyaoet al., 2011; Taniguchi
et al., 2008), except for rice expressing theZ. mays NADP-ME
cDNA driven by the Arabidopsis chlorophylla/b-binding protein
promoter (Takeuchi et al., 2000; Tsuchida et al., 2001), which
severely inhibited photosynthesis and growth. Indeed, this has led
authors to propose that high levels of activity and expression of
C
4 cycle enzymes in a C3 leaf is neutral under normal growth
conditions (Karki et al., 2020). Fukayamaet al. (2003) proposed
that in rice with high-level expression of maize PEPC, ﬂux through
PEPC in vivowas low, as PEP levels were limiting. Similarly, MDH
overexpression alone had little physiological effect, potentially
because of low availability of oxaloacetate in chloroplasts (Kandoi
et al., 2018). Conceivably, concurrent overexpression of ﬁve C
4
enzymes was required to detect13C ﬂux into malate, as well as
the photosynthetic phenotype seen here. Synthesis of malate in
the transgenic rice lines produced here presumably occurred in
chloroplasts and consumed NADPH produced by electron trans-
port. This additional consumption of NADPH could potentially
inhibit CO
2 ﬁxation and deplete reducing power required for
other reactions. All three transgenic lines showed an extended
photosynthetic dark-to-light induction (Figure 5), and the severity
of this phenotype was greater in lines B6 and 29 showing higher
CO
2 ﬂux to C4 acids (Figure 3). This extended induction phase
could be related to slower opening of stomata (Lawson and Blatt,
2014), autocatalytic build-up of metabolites (Walker, 1973) or
delayed light-activation of enzymes (Anderson et al., 1978).
Although enzymes of the C
4 cycle establish guard cell turgor
(Santelia and Lawson, 2016), stomatal conductance is not the
primary cause of this phenomenon since the C
i/Ca ratio was
similar in all plants (Figure 5). Depletion of reducing power,
however, could down-regulate activity of the chloroplast thiore-
doxin reductase that uses NADPH to activate CBC enzymes and
ATP synthase speciﬁcally during the dark-to-light transition and
under low light (Nikkanen et al., 2018; Yoshida and Hisabori,
2016). This reduced activation could contribute to the build-up of
DpH and result in the slower NPQ relaxation observed in the
transgenic lines (Figure 5). Additionally, reduced F
V/FM and the
strongest NPQ phenotype during the induction seen in line B6
(Table 2, Figure 5) could be a result of the enhanced NADP-ME
abundance seen in this line, leading to a mild version of the
chlorotic phenotype reported by Tsuchidaet al. (2001).
in C
3 plants, chloroplastic MDH is part of the malate shuttle; it
contributes to photoprotection by oxidizing stromal electron
acceptors (Scheibe and Stitt, 1988) and enables regulation of
gene expression by equilibrating the redox state between cellular
compartments (Dietz et al., 2016). C
3 MDH is regulated by
thioredoxin m and thus is active only when NAPDH accumulates
and the thioredoxin system is pushed into a more reduced state
(Collin et al., 2003; Scheibe, 1987). In C4 plants, the activation
state of MDH is dynamically regulated by the ratio of NADPH to
NADP
+ (Ashton and Hatch, 1983; Rebeille and Hatch, 1986). The
higher malate efﬂux from chloroplasts may potentially contribute
to the differential regulation of multiple genes involved in light
sensing, stomatal regulation and the circadian clock observed in
the RNA proﬁles of the transgenic lines (Table S5). In summary,
taken together these results indicate that the C
4 photosynthetic
enzymes expressed in the transgenic lines are functionalin vivo
and catalyse a partial C4 pathway.
Concluding comments
For the ﬁrst time, we demonstrate that a partial C4 pathway can
be established in rice by transformation with a single construct
harbouring coding sequences for ﬁve enzymes of C4 metabolism.
Whilst expression levels of these enzymes require improvement,
the cell-speciﬁc expression patterns were largely appropriate for
two-cell C
4 photosynthesis and the observed photosynthetic
phenotypes of the transgenic plants were consistent with C4-
carboxylation occurring in vivo. These results suggest that a full
C4 metabolic pathway may be achievable in rice.
Materials and methods
Generation of transgenic plants
Two constructs, EC18089 and EC18089B (Figure S12), were
assembled in a plant binary vector pAGM4723 using the Golden
Gate MoClo Plant Parts Kit (Engler et al ., 2014). The ﬁrst
expression module was occupied either by the hygromycin
phosphotransferase gene (hpt) in EC18089 or bialaphos resis-
tance gene (bar) in EC18089B, in both cases theZ. maysubiquitin
promoter. Other modules were identical in the two constructs.
The second module was occupied by the coding sequence of
ZmPEPC (GRMZM2G083841) driven by the Panicum miliaceum
PEPC promoter + 5’-UTR (Guptaet al., 2020). The third module
was occupied by the coding sequence of ZmMDH
(GRMZM2G129513) under the control of the Z. mays PEPC
promoter (Matsuoka et al ., 1994). The fourth module was
occupied by the coding sequence of ZmNADP-ME

Partial C4 cycle in rice using a single construct583
(GRMZM2G085019) under the control of theF. trinervia GLDP
promoter (Engelmann et al ., 2008). The ﬁfth module was
occupied by the coding sequence of ZmPPDK
(GRMZM2G097457) driven by the Setaria viridis PEPC pro-
moter + 5’-UTR (Gupta et al., 2020). The sixth module was
occupied by the coding sequence ofZmCA (GRMZM2G348512)
driven by theUrochloa maxima PEPCpromoter + 5’-UTR (Gupta
et al., 2020). All coding and promoter sequences were domes-
ticated for the Golden Gate cloning system (Engleret al., 2014).
The bacterial terminator tNos was used in all modules. Both
constructs were veriﬁed by sequencing and transformed into
Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain AGL1 for stable rice transfor-
mation (Toki et al., 2006) as described in detail in Method S1.
T0 plants were analysed for insertion copy number of thehpt or
bar genes by droplet digital PCR (iDNA genetics, UK). T0 plant of
line 1 carried three copies ofhpt, whilst T0 plants of lines 29 and
B6 had one copy ofhpt and bar, respectively. Analysis ofhpt copy
number in the T1 progeny of line 1 suggested that the three
insertions segregated as a single genetic locus. Plants containing
homozygous insertions were identiﬁed in T
1 progenies of the
three transgenic lines and seeds of those plants were thereafter
used in all experiments. From a total of 47 independent
transformation events, 25 were examined, and of these, less
than half showed expression of all ﬁve genes at the transcript
level (Figure S13).
Plant growth conditions
Rice plants were grown in a controlled environment chamber
(Model PGC Flex, Conviron, Winnipeg, MB, Canada) under
ambient CO
2 partial pressure, 16-h photoperiod, 28°C day, 22
°C night and 60% humidity. Irradiance of 400 lmol photons
m/C02 s/C01 (if not stated otherwise) was supplied by a mixture of
ﬂuorescent tubes (Master TL5 HO 54W/840, Philips Lighting,
The Netherlands) and halogen incandescent globes (42W 2800K
warm white clear glass 630 lumens, CLA, Brookvale, Australia).
Plants were individually grown in 1-L pots in a soil mix
composed by 80% peat/10% perlite/10% vermiculite (pH 5.6-
5.8) mixed with 5 g of slow-release fertilizer (Osmocote,
Evergreen Garden Care, Australia) supplied once at the begin-
ning of the growth cycle. All pots were kept at ﬁeld water
capacity. Z. mays cv. B73 plants were grown in a controlled
environment chamber using the same settings except that the
light was supplied by 1000W red sunrise 3200K lamps
(Sunmaster Growlamps, Solon, OH).
For
13CO2 labelling experiments, rice plants were grown in 1-L
pots in a 2:1 mixture of peat substrate and medium-sized grain
quartz sand (Einheitserdewerke Werkverband e.V, Sinntal-Alten-
gronau, Germany), containing 0.66 mL L-1 Plantacote Depote 4M
(Wilhelm Haug GmbH & Co. KG, Ammerbuch, Germany) and
0.66 mL L-1 Fetrilon Combi (COMPO EXPERT GmbH, Muenster,
Germany) fertilizer. Plants were grown in a controlled environment
chamber with a 16-h photoperiod and an irradiance of 350lmol
photons m
/C02 s/C01 provided by LED lights, day/night temperatures
of 26°C/22 °C and constant 70% humidity. Pots were submerged
in water. The plants were vegetatively propagated by detaching
and re-planting tillers at 35 days after sowing (DAS) and used for
13CO2 labelling experiments at 60 and 61 DAS. An additional
13CO2 labelling experiment was performed at 79 DAS.
RT-PCR and RNA sequencing
Leaf discs were collected from the mid-distal leaf blade portion of
the youngest fully expanded leaf from the central stem of 4-
week-old rice plants, frozen in liquid N
2 and stored at /C080 °C.
Frozen samples were homogenized using a Qiagen TissueLyser II
(Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands). RNA was extracted using an
RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands). DNA
from the samples was removed using an Ambion TURBO DNA
free kit (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Tewksbury, MA) and RNA
quality was determined using a NanoDrop (Thermo Fisher
Scientiﬁc, Tewksbury, MA). For RT-PCR, 200 ng of total RNA
were reverse transcribed into cDNA using an RT
2 HT First Strand
cDNA synthesis kit (Qiagen, Venlo, The Netherlands). Primers
listed in Table S6 were used for RT-PCR and amplicons were
visualized in 1% agarose gels.
For RNA sequencing, leaf discs from three plants were pooled
together as one biological replicate and three biological replicates
per genotype were analysed. cDNA synthesis, library preparation
and sequencing were performed by BGI (https://www.bgi.com/).
The raw sequence reads are available from EBI array express
under the accession number E-MTAB-9129. Trimmomatic v0.39
(Bolger et al., 2014) was used to trim off the sequencing adapters
and remove low quality bases using the following settings:
LEADING:20 TRAILING:20 SLIDINGWINDOW:5:20 HEADCROP:1
MINLEN:35. The most recent version of the complete set ofO.
sativa transcripts (Osativa_323_v7.0.transcript.fa) was obtained
from Phytozome V13 (Goodstein et al., 2011). The transcript
sequences with correct 5’UTR and 3’UTR sequences (as per
promoters and terminators used in the construct) corresponding
to ZmCA, ZmPEPC, ZmMDH, ZmPPDK and ZmME were added to
this ﬁle so that the transgenes could be simultaneously quantiﬁed
with the rice transcriptome. The quality ﬁltered trimmed reads
were mapped to this modiﬁed reference transcriptome using
Salmon (Patroet al., 2017). Prior to differential expression testing,
the read counts for multiple isoforms of the same gene were
summed to produce a single transcript abundance estimate per
gene locus. These counts were then used as input to test for
differential expression using DESeq2 v3.9 (Love et al., 2014).
Genes were considered differentially expressed between WT and
transgenic plants if the Benjamini–Hochberg adjustedP-value was
≤0.01. The read counts for genes of the WT and transgenic rice
lines are provided in Data S2. Accession numbers for endogenous
rice genes that are orthologous to C
4 transgenes and were used
for comparison in Figure 1a are: OsKitaake01g256600.1.p (CA),
OsKitaake08g251400.2.p ( MDH), OsKitaake01g064200.1.p
(NADP-ME), OsKitaake02g105200.1.p ( PEPC), OsKitaa-
ke05g157000.1.p (PPDK).
Enzyme assays and immunodetection
Enzyme activities were determined using leaf extracts from fresh
or frozen leaf tissue. For PPDK activity, a leaf disc was taken from
the portion of leaf illuminated with the LI-6800 (LI -COR
Biosciences, Lincoln, NE) during gas-exchange measurements
and immediately ground in a glass homogenizer in extraction
buffer (Ashton et al., 1990; Voznesenskaya et al., 2003). PEPC
activity was determined from the same fresh leaf extract (Pengelly
et al., 2010). Additional leaf discs were frozen in liquid N
2 and
stored at/C080 °C to later determine activities of Rubisco (Pengelly
et al., 2010), NADP-ME (Pengellyet al., 2012), MDH (Johnson and
Hatch, 1970; Tsuchida et al., 2001) and CA (von Caemmerer
et al., 2004). All enzyme activities were assayed at 25°C and
expressed per unit leaf surface area. Leaf chlorophyll content was
determined spectrophotometrically in 80% acetone buffered
with 25 mM 4-(2-hydroxyethyl)-1-piperazineethanesulfonic acid
(Hepes)-KOH (Porra et al., 1989).

For western blotting, aliquots of the leaf protein extracts used
for enzyme activity measurements were supplemented with 2%
(w/v) sodium dodecyl sulphate, separated by polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane
according to (Ermakovaet al., 2019). Proteins were probed with
antisera against Z. mays PEPC (1:10,000 dilution, Karki et al.,
2020), Z. mays PPDK (1:20,000 dilution, Karki et al., 2020), Z.
mays MDH (1:5000 dilution, Karkiet al., 2020), Z. mays NADP-
ME (1:5000 dilution, Karkiet al., 2020; Sonawaneet al., 2018),
AcV5 tag (ab49581, Abcam, Cambridge, UK, 1:3000 dilution)
and tobacco Rubisco (prepared by S.M. Whitney, 1:10,000).
Secondary goat anti-rabbit horseradish peroxidase-conjugated
(Biorad, Hercules, CA) or goat anti-mouse horseradish peroxi-
dase-conjugated (Agrisera, V €ann€as, Sweden) antibodies were
used at a 1:5000 dilution. Chemiluminescence signal from the
membranes was obtained with a Western Lightning Ultra kit
(Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) and detected by a ChemiDoc MP
imaging system (Biorad, Hercules, CA). Results were analysed in
Image Lab software (Biorad, Hercules, CA). Details of immunolo-
calization of C
4 enzymes performed on leaf sections are in
Method S3. Proteins were visualized under a Leica SP8 laser
scanning confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH, Wet-
zlar, Germany) at 488 nm excitation and 546 to 600 nm
emission. Simultaneously, ﬂuorescence from calcoﬂuor white-
stained cell walls was detected at 434 to 445 nm following
excitation at 405 nm. Chlorophyll autoﬂuorescence was captured
using 633 nm excitation and 650 to 742 nm emission. Images
were analysed using LAS X software (Leica Microsystems GmbH,
Wetzlar, Germany).
Leaf gas-exchange analysis
Leaf-atmosphere CO2 and H2O exchange and chlorophyll ﬂuores-
cence measurements were conducted with two portable photo-
synthesis systems LI-6800 equipped with a Multiphase ﬂashTM
ﬂuorometer circular chamber (6800-01A) as described in detail
Method S4. The LI-COR leaf chamber was set at PPFD of 1500µmol
photons m/C02 s/C01 (90% red/10% blue), leaf temperature of 25°C,
leaf-to-air vapour-pressure deﬁcit of 1.0 kPa and the airﬂow rate of
500 µmol s/C01. Multiphase ﬂash of 10,000µmol photons m-2 s-1
(ramp 25%) was applied to leaves to transiently close all PSII
reaction centres and monitor the maximum ﬂuorescence in the
light (F’M) and the steady-state ﬂuorescence (FS). Photochemical
yield of PSII was determined asΦPSII = (F’M-FS)/F’M (Genty et al.,
1989). The light-driven electron transport rate through PSII was
determined as ETR = a*PPFD*b*ΦPSII, where a is the leaf
absorbance of photosynthetic quanta (0.843 according to Bj€ork-
man and Demmig, 1987) andb is the fraction of photons absorbed
by PSII (0.5 according to Maxwell and Johnson, 2000).
For dark-to-light induction measurements, leaves were dark-
adapted for 40 min and then enclosed in the dark ﬂuorometer
chamber for 10 minutes to measure dark respiration rate, the
minimum PSII ﬂuorescence (F
0) and the maximum PSII ﬂuores-
cence (FM). The maximum quantum yield of PSII was calculated as
FV/FM = (FM-F0)/FM. Afterwards, the leaf was illuminated with
actinic light of 500µmol photons m-2 s/C01 to monitor photosyn-
thetic induction. Non-photochemical quenching was estimated as
NPQ = (FM-F’M)/F’M.
Fitting of the A-Ci response curves
The maximum leaf carboxylation rate allowed by Rubisco, the rate
of photosynthetic electron transport and triose phosphate use
were obtained by ﬁtting the A-Ci response curves (Ca steps from 0
to 190 Pa) at atmosphericpO2 using the ﬁtting routine (Sharkey
et al., 2007). Leaf mesophyll conductance to CO2 diffusion (gm)o f
6.7 µmol CO2 m-2 s-1 Pa-1 was previously determined for rice
(von Caemmerer and Evans, 2015). For A-Ci response curves
recorded at different O 2 levels, the least square regression
method was applied to the initial slope (for Ci ≤ 9 Pa) to calculate
the CO2 compensation point (Γ, Pa).
13CO2 labelling and quenching procedure
Labelling chambers were custom-designed as shown in Figure S2.
Details of chambers and the labelling procedure are described in
detail in Method S2. Two sets of experiments were conducted: (i)
13CO2-pulse labelling (0, 5, 15, 30, 300 and 600 s) was
performed to determine the extent of13C incorporation into C4
acids and other intermediates, and (ii) pulse-chase labelling (30 s
13CO2-pulse/0, 5, 15, 30, 60, 90 and 120 s 12CO2 chase) to
detect movement of label out of C 4 acids and into CBC
intermediates. To gain a more complete overview of the temporal
kinetics of
13C incorporation into each metabolite, we analysed
single samples at multiple time points. Unlabelled samples (0)
were also collected from leaves placed in the labelling chamber
and ﬂushed with the unlabelled air mixture for 1 min. The order
of the
13CO2-pulse labelling and pulse-chase labelling times was
randomized.
Metabolite analyses and calculation of total pool size,
13C enrichment and isotopomer distributions
Frozen samples were homogenized using a ball mill (Tesch,
Haan, Germany) at liquid nitrogen temperature. Chemicals used
for quantiﬁcation were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, Missouri,
USA), Roche (Basel, Switzerland) or Merck (Darmstadt, Ger-
many). For LC-MS/MS analysis, samples were extracted with
chloroform–methanol as described in Arrivault et al. (2016).
Isotopomers were measured by reverse-phase LC-MS/MS
(malate, aspartate, PEP, RuBP, 3PGA, DHAP and 2PG; Arrivault
et al., 2016) or anion-exchange LC-MS/MS (with modiﬁcations
as described in Figueroaet al., 2016; pyruvate and citrate; Lunn
et al., 2006) with authentic standards for accurate metabolite
quantiﬁcation. Total amounts of malate, aspartate, citrate,
RuBP, DHAP and 2PG were calculated by summing isotopomers.
The total amounts of PEP, pyruvate and 3PGA were determined
enzymatically in freshly prepared trichloroacetic acid extracts as
described in (Merlo et al., 1993), except for a modiﬁed assay
buffer containing 50 m
M Hepes-KOH, pH 7.5, 200 m M KCl,
40 mM MgCl2 used for the determination of PEP and pyruvate.
Net accumulation of 13C in each metabolite was calculated by
multiplying the 13C enrichment by the number of C atoms in
the molecule (n) and by the total amount of the metabolite. Net
accumulation was plotted against 13C-pulse labelling time
(Figure S4) and the initial slope provided a proxy for minimum
13C ﬂuxes (see Data S1 for calculation steps); these are a
minimum estimate because some 13C may exit the metabolite
pool during the pulse. Estimation of ﬂux at PEPC is described in
Data S1.
Statistics and reproducibility
One-way ANOVA and Tukey post hoc test for the pairwise
comparisons of means (a = 0.05) was applied to all leaf traits
determined in the present study using OriginPro 2018b software
