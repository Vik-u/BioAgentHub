Exploiting differences in the
energy budget among C4
subtypes to improve crop
productivity
Summary
C4 crops of agricultural importance all belong to the NADP-malic
enzyme (ME) subtype, and this subtype has been the template for
C
4 introductions into C3 crops, like rice, to improve their produc-
tivity. However, the ATP cost for the C4 cycle in both NADP-ME and
NAD-ME subtypes accounts for> 40% of the total ATP require-
ment for CO2 assimilation. These high ATP costs, and the associated
need for intense cyclic electron transport and low intrinsic quantum
yield Φ
CO2 , are major constraints in realizing strong improvements
of canopy photosynthesis and crop productivity. Based on math-
ematical modelling, we propose a C4 ideotype that utilizes low
chloroplastic ATP requirements present in the nondomesticated
phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEP-CK) subtype. The ideo-
type is a mixed form of NAD(P)-ME and PEP-CK types, requires no
cyclic electron transport under low irradiances, and its theoretical
Φ
CO2 is c. 25% higher than that of a C4 crop type. Its cell-type-
speciﬁc ATP and NADPH requirements can be fulﬁlled by local
energy production. The ideotype is projected to havec. 10% yield
advantage over NADP-ME-type crops and> 50% advantage over
C3 counterparts. The ideotype provides a unique (theoretical) case
where ΦCO2 could be improved, thereby paving a new avenue for
improving photosynthesis in both C3 and C4 crops.
Introduction
Increasing yields of major food crops, like wheat and rice, to cope
with increasing populations is a major challenge in agriculture,
especially in the face of an accelerating climate change (Fischer
et al., 2014). Crop yield improvement by the Green Revolution in
the 1960s has resulted almost exclusively from the increased harvest
index by introducing (semi)dwarﬁng genes, which allowed more
fertilizer input without the risk of having more lodging (Fischer
et al., 2014). Afterwards, crop yield potential has been improved
progressively; for example, by optimizing morphological charac-
teristics and exploiting heterosis (Yuan, 2017). Since the beneﬁt
from approaches such as improving harvest index may have reached
a maximum value, further improvement of crop productivity has to
come from signiﬁcantly improved crop photosynthesis compe-
tence, either by increasing leaf photosynthesis efﬁciency or by
improving light interception, or by optimizing the proﬁle of
photosynthetic resources in the crop canopy (Zhuet al., 2010).
Whereas conventional breeding may have selected photosyn-
thesis-related traits that likely contributed partly to recent yield
progress (Fischer et al., 2014), the natural variation in leaf
photosynthesis above the check variety within a species is generally
small (Guet al., 2014). Therefore, several research consortia have
aimed to introduce C
4 photosynthesis (as in maize) into C3 crops
(like rice) via genetic engineering (e.g. von Caemmereret al., 2012;
Schuler et al., 2016), and signiﬁcant progress has already been made
– see the recent reviews of Weber & Bar-Even (2019) and
Ermakova et al. (2020). The rationale for these endeavours is the
CO2-concentrating mechanism (CCM) in C4 leaves that largely
suppresses photorespiration, thereby resulting in higher light-
saturated maximum leaf photosynthetic capacityA
max (see Sup-
porting Information Table S1 for symbol deﬁnitions) in C4 than
C3 leaves. It was hoped that rice productivity could be increased by
50% when initially conceiving the C4 rice project (Mitchell &
Sheehy, 2006). However, more recent analysis, using a crop model
based on more detailed physiological parameters, showed that
potential productivity of rice when grown under the current
climatic condition could be increased by only 33 –42% by
introducing the complete maize-like C
4 mechanism, and the
advantage was even lower under future high-CO2 atmospheric
conditions (Yin & Struik, 2017). This less-than-expected advan-
tage, as also predicted by Bellasio & Farquhar (2019), has been
explained by little gain of quantum yield of photosynthetic CO
2
assimilation ΦCO2 in maize-C4 relative to C3 plants, because the
photosynthetic rate of lower leaves in a full canopy is largely
determined byΦ
CO2 rather than byAmax. Many studies (e.g. Day &
Chalabi, 1988; Guet al., 2014) showed that full-canopy photo-
synthesis generally depends more onΦCO2 than onAmax.
The small advantage ofΦCO2 in maize relative to rice leaves is
because the operation of CCM in maize leaves requires ATP and the
production of ATP is limited under low light conditions prevalent
in lower leaves of a canopy. The Calvin cycle for assimilating 1 mol
CO
2 requires 2 mol NADPH and 3 mol ATP, whereas the C4
cycle in maize additionally requires 2 mol ATP because of the
regeneration of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) by pyruvate, phos-
phate dikinase (PPDK) in the C
4 cycle (Hatch, 1987). This means
that the C4 cycle accounts forc. 40% of the total ATP consumption
(von Caemmerer & Furbank, 1999). As the generally believed
stoichiometry of linear electron transport (LET) in chloroplasts
gives an ATP : NADPH ratio of 1.5 (Allen, 2003), the ratio exactly
matching the required ratio by the Calvin cycle, the ATP required
for the C
4 cycle has to come from the cyclic electron transport
(CET; Yin & Struik, 2012). In the C4 cycle, bicarbonate ions,
converted from CO2, are ﬁxed in mesophyll (M) cells by PEP

carboxylase (PEPc) to produce oxaloacetate (OAA); OAA is quickly
reduced to malate or converted to aspartate. These C4 acids move to
bundle-sheath (BS) cells, where they are decarboxylated to deliver
CO
2 to Rubisco to start the Calvin cycle. There are different
enzymes for decarboxylating C4 acids in BS compartments, and C4
species have been classiﬁed traditionally into three subtypes
according to the decarboxylating enzyme: NADP-malic enzyme
(ME) in chloroplasts, NAD-ME in mitochondria, and PEP-
carboxykinase (CK) in the cytosol (Hatch, 1987; Fig. S1).
In NADP-ME and NAD-ME subtypes, decarboxylating malate
into CO
2 produces pyruvate. Pyruvate moves directly (in the
NADP-ME subtype) or via aminotransferase (in the NAD-ME
subtype) to M cells, where pyruvate reacts to regenerate PEP by
PPDK (Fig. S1a,b). Based on the NADPH and ATP requirement
and generally estimated leakiness ϕ, the fraction for the CO
2
leakage from BS to M cells, Yin & Struik (2018) theoretically
calculated that ΦCO2 of the two ME subtypes under the
atmospheric condition wasc. 0.064 mol mol−1 (Table 1), com-
parable to the measuredΦCO2 (Ehleringer & Pearcy, 1983). These
values are not much higher thanΦCO2 of C3 species (Ehleringer &
Pearcy, 1983) if adjusted for reference temperature 25°C under the
current atmospheric CO2 conditions. This indicates that, at low
irradiances, the gain from CCM in minimizing photorespiration is
largely cancelled out by the extra ATP requirement for CCM. C
4
crops of agricultural importance for food and energy (maize,
sorghum, millet, sugarcane, andMiscanthus × giganteus) all belong
to the NADP-ME subtype (Hatch, 1987; Sage, 2016), and the
subtype has been used as the template for developing C
4 rice (Karki
et al., 2013).
In the PEP-CK subtype, a portion of OAA is reduced to malate,
using NADPH from M chloroplasts, and its remaining portion
moves, via aspartate, to the BS cytosol. The OAA in the BS cytosol is
directly decarboxylated by PEP-CK while NAD-ME
simultaneously decarboxylates malate in the BS mitochondria
(Hatch, 1987; Fig. S1c). Although this PEP-CK subtype requires
additional NADPH to operate, it is the most efﬁcient C
4 type in
terms of ATP requirement from the chloroplast electron transport
chain. First, only 1 mol ATP is required per mole of OAA
decarboxylated by PEP-CK into CO2 and PEP (Hatch, 1987;
Kanai & Edwards, 1999), and the PEP returns directly to the M
cytosol, thereby minimizing the use of PPDK that would need
2 mol ATP to regenerate 1 mol PEP. Second, the ATP required by
PEP-CK can be exclusively produced by NADH oxidation in the
respiratory chain of BS mitochondria associated with malate
decarboxylation (Hatch, 1987; Burnell & Hatch, 1988). As the
stoichiometry of ATP production per oxidation of NADH in
mitochondria (the ATP : NADH ration) is believed to be either 3
(von Caemmerer & Furbank, 1999) or 2.5 (Kanai & Edwards,
1999) – much higher than the generally believed ATP : NADPH
ratio of 1.5 for the LET in chloroplasts– the cost for additional
NADPH in this subtype is actually overcompensated for by its
involvement of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. The
only extra chloroplastic ATP required in this PEP-CK subtype
arises from the regeneration of PEP by PPDK from malate
decarboxylation-derived pyruvate, which is 0.5 mol (ifn = 3) or
0.572 mol (ifn = 2.5) ATP per mole CO
2 assimilated (Yin &
Struik, 2018). Therefore, the proportionx of the chloroplastic ATP
consumed by the C4 cycle is theoretically 0.15–0.17 in the PEP-CK
subtype, considerably lower than the 0.4 for the NADP-ME and
NAD-ME subtypes (Table 1). Based on the NADPH and ATP
budget, and assuming the same proportions of leakiness and
photorespiration, Yin & Struik (2018) theoretically calculated that
the Φ
CO2 of the PEP-CK subtype isc. 0.080–0.081 mol mol−1
(Table 1), c. 26% higher than theΦCO2 of the NADP-ME and
NAD-ME subtypes. Such an advantage, if engineered into C4
crops, would signiﬁcantly increase canopy photosynthesis and,

thus, crop yield. Indeed, the simulation of Yin & Struik (2017)
showed that crop productivity can be increased almost linearly with
decreasing ATP demands by the CCM.
However, literature-reported values ofΦ
CO2 measured under
ambient conditions are not signiﬁcantly higher in the PEP-CK
species than in C4 species of the other subtypes, especially not when
compared with the NADP-ME species (Ehleringer & Pearcy,
1983). The gaps between theoretically expected and experimentally
measured Φ
CO2 in the PEP-CK species have not been explained yet.
Here, we ﬁrst propose hypotheses that could explain the small
advantage of the PEP-CK subtype inΦ
CO2 over the other subtypes.
On this basis, we describe a scheme for the energy budget in the
PEP-CK subtype and extend the model of Yin & Struik (2012) to
calculate the ΦCO2 of this PEP-CK subtype. By exploring
theoretical margins using this extended model, we propose a C4
ideotype and assess whether this would have advantages over the
current crop C
4 type (NADP-ME) at the canopy level. With this
approach, we hope to open a new horizon by redesigning strategies
to introduce the C
4-ness into C3 crops, given that most attention so
far has been paid to how to make C4 enzymes and structures
function and little attention has been paid to the C4 energetics
(Ermakova et al., 2020).
Hypotheses
Hypothesis 1: ﬂux of amino groups between mesophyll and
bundle-sheath cells needs to be balanced
The classical PEP-CK subtype (Hatch, 1987; Burnell & Hatch,
1988) was deﬁned assuming that the ATP required by PEP-CK
could be exclusively produced by NADH oxidation in the
respiratory chain of BS mitochondria associated with NAD-ME-
dependent malate decarboxylation. Ifn = 3, only 25% of the CO
2
from C4-acid decarboxylation in BS cells is from the NAD-ME
activity; and ifn = 2.5, the NAD-ME-associated decarboxylation
will account for 28.6% of the CO2 generated. This deﬁnition of the
PEP-CK subtype did not consider the phosphate balance and the
required amino (NH2)-ﬂux balance. Phosphate is generally believed
to freely diffuse, and its availability is carefully regulated (Heldtet al.,
1987). However, the NH2-ﬂux balance between M and BS cells is
highly relevant for both NAD-ME and PEP-CK subtypes. In the
NAD-ME subtype, OAA reacts with glutamate (with NH
2)t of o r m
aspartate, which is transported to BS mitochondria where it is
deaminated to release OAA. The OAA is then converted to malate,
and the malate decarboxylation product, pyruvate, is converted to
alanine, which is shuttled to the M cytosol; thereby, the NH
2 ﬂux is
balanced between M and BS cells (Fig. S1b). The direct OAA
decarboxylation by PEP-CK cannot achieve such a balance because
its product, PEP, returns directly to the M cells (Fig. S1c). This
inability to achieve the balance by direct OAA decarboxylation is one
of the reasons why the ‘PEP-CK-only’ C
4 type has hardly been
identiﬁed in nature (Furbank, 2011). The parallel running of malate
decarboxylation via NAD-ME and direct OAA decarboxylation via
PEP-CK only alleviates the imbalance in the PEP-CK subtype. The
balance can be achieved only if the two decarboxylation pathways are
equal in using the initial OAA (i.e. 50% each).
For such a scenario where NAD-ME and PEP-CK-dependent
decarboxylation each deliver 50% of CO
2 to Rubisco, the required
ATP per C4 cycle would be 1.5, consisting of 0.5 ATP for PEP-CK
activity in BS cells and 1.0 ATP for the regeneration of 0.5 mol PEP
in M cells by PPDK. The oxidation of 0.5 NADH will provide 1.50
ATP (n = 3) or 1.25 ATP (n = 2.5), exactly or almost sufﬁcient
already to satisfy the required ATP for running the C4 cycle.
However, the LET for supplying the extra 0.5 NADPH for this
scenario also produces a certain amount of ATP, which can be
calculated as ð2 /C2 0:5Þð2 þ f
Q Þ=h, where (2 + fQ)/h is ATP
produced per LET (fQ, fraction of electrons at plastoquinone that
follow the Q cycle;h, proton : ATP ratio) (Yin & Struik, 2012).
Assuming the most likely valuesfQ = 1a n dh = 4 (Yin & Struik,
2012), the LET would produce 0.75 ATP, which is more than
enough to fulﬁl the shortfall of 0.25 ATP ifn = 2.5. The ‘50%
each’ scenario was also proposed by Br¨autigam et al. (2014) as the
model for energy and NH
2 balance of the PEP-CK subtype.
However, they overestimated the extra ATP requirement of this
scenario because their analysis ignored that the NADH oxidation
provides more ATP than required by the PEP-CK activity and that
the LET associated with 0.5 NADPH also produces ATP. Here, we
indicate that, for this scenario, the CO
2 assimilation of the PEP-CK
type would be NADPH limited (rather than ATP limited), and
there is no need at all to engage the CET that is required for
generating ATP in other C
4 subtypes. The theoretical ΦCO2
calculated using the approach of Yin & Struik (2018) for this type is
0.075 mol mol−1 (Table 1), which is somewhat lower than the
theoretical ΦCO2 (0.080–0.081 mol mol−1) for the classical PEP-
CK subtype but still higher than the measuredΦCO2 of the PEP-CK
species.
Hypothesis 2: PEP-CK species represent various mixtures of
the classically deﬁned PEP-CK component with NAD(P)-ME
and/or with less efﬁcient PEP-CK forms
Apparently, the aforementioned scenario of 50% each for two
parallel decarboxylating pathways does not predict the measured
ΦCO2 , nor can it generate the required balance in the ATP :
NADPH ratio. We hypothesize that there must be a third, higher
ATP-requiring decarboxylating way (or even ways) involved in the
PEP-CK subtype.
First, there might be additional NAD-ME or NADP-ME-based
decarboxylation. Since there is hardly any NADP-ME activity in
PEP-CK species (Hatch, 1987; Kanai & Edwards, 1999;
Br¨autigam, 2014; Koteyavaet al., 2015), this third pathway likely
involves NAD-ME. The latter enzyme is already involved in the
classical PEP-CK subtype (associated with providing ATP for PEP-
CK activity); but we hypothesize that the additional NAD-ME
activity functions as it occurs in the classical NAD-ME subtype, in
which the NH
2-ﬂux is balanced (see earlier). As such, on the one
hand, NAD-ME provides ATP for PEP-CK activity and, on the
other hand, functions independently with an increased ATP cost of
CCM. However, the possibility that the third decarboxylation is
NADP-ME dependent or a mixed NAD-ME and NADP-ME type
cannot be ruled out, as NADP-ME has been found in some PEP-
CK species (Sonawaneet al., 2018). Because the NADP-ME itself

does not involve any transamination, the NH2-ﬂux balance can also
be guaranteed.
Second, the PEP produced by PEP-CK in the BS cells is so far
believed to move directly to the M cells (Fig. S1c). However, the
fate of PEP is uncertain. The PEP can ﬁrst be converted in BS cells
to pyruvate, which moves via alanine aminotransferase to the M
cells (Smith & Woolhouse, 1983), where pyruvate is converted to
PEP by PPDK. The conversion of PEP to pyruvate in the BS cells
could occur via pyruvate kinase, releasing one ATP per PEP
converted (Schuleret al., 2016). Thus, the ATP balance for the C
4
cycle is neutral in the BS cells as the one ATP required for PEP-CK
is equal to the one ATP released by pyruvate kinase. For this case,
ΦCO2 would be the same as for the ﬁrst case where PEP-CK is mixed
with NAD-ME or/and NADP-ME.
Third, the conversion of PEP to pyruvate in BS cells could also
occur via PEP phosphatase (Smith & Woolhouse, 1983). This
enzyme releases orthophosphate, resulting in a loss of chemical
energy to entropy (Br¨autigam et al., 2018), in contrast to pyruvate
kinase that conserves energy. Therefore, this case would predict an
even lowerΦ
CO2 in the PEP-CK subtype than in the NADP-ME
and NAD-ME subtypes, and works probably for the PEP-CK
species where ΦCO2 is intrinsically low, or/and where only low
activity of pyruvate kinase is detectable in BS cells (Kanai &
Edwards, 1999).
The PEP in BS cells might also be converted via enolase and
phosphoglyceromutase to 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA), which
could move to the M cells and be converted back to PEP via the
same enzymes (Huber & Edwards, 1975). This reaction may be
engaged when the conversion of PEP to pyruvate cannot account
for all of the carbon ﬂux through the C
4 cycle (Smith &
Woolhouse, 1983). However, as this reaction does not involve
any energy gain or loss, it would predict the sameΦ
CO2 as the
classical PEP-CK type. Furthermore, the conversion to 3-PGA
cannot contribute to maintain the NH
2-ﬂux balance. So, this
mechanism will not be considered further. By contrast, the
aforementioned second and third mechanisms involving pyruvate
kinase and PEP phosphatase, respectively, not only can bring the
theoretical Φ
CO2 of the PEP-CK subtype equal to that of the ME
subtypes but can also lower the BS : total ATP requirement ratio
(compared with the previously discussed ‘pure PEP-CK’ type) and
maintain the NH
2-ﬂux balance between M and BS cells. The high
BS : total ATP requirement ratio (3 : 4, Yin & Struik, 2018) and
the NH
2-ﬂux imbalance (Furbank, 2011) were argued to explain
why the ‘pure PEP-CK’ type was hardly found in nature. Our
hypothesis suggests that there are multiple scenarios for pure PEP-
CK and hints that a pure PEP-CK type, if involving pyruvate kinase
or PEP phosphatase, may actually exist.
Model for the mixed PEP-CK form
A scheme for quantitative proportions of possible decarboxylating
pathways in the PEP-CK subtype, which incorporates both
Hypothesis 1 and Hypothesis 2, is provided in Fig. 1. This scheme
both fulﬁls energetic demands and guarantees the NH
2-ﬂux
balance. The value of parametera (the proportion of the initial
OAA that is reduced to malate in M chloroplasts to ultimately drive
mitochondrial electron transport in BS cells and produce ATP) is a
crucial parameter for this mixed type. Its value has a strong impact
on the cellular NADPH : ATP production ratio, and, thereby, on
the required fraction for cyclic electron transport f
CET. Both
parameters, a and fCET, are hard to measure experimentally. We
developed equations for calculating these two parameters using
Φ
CO2 that can be easily measured. These equations and their
derivations are given in Notes S1.
Note that photorespiration may be higher in species of the NAD-
ME or PEP-CK subtypes than in the NADP-ME subtype, because
of larger amounts of photosystem II (PSII) in BS cells (thereby
relatively more oxygen (O
2) evolution as a result of LET), and
because of decarboxylation taking place either in mitochondria or
in cytosol (thereby, a higher chance for the released CO2 to escape
from the reﬁxation by Rubisco in BS chloroplasts, the organelle
where decarboxylation occurs in the NADP-ME subtype). Quan-
tifying to what extent photorespiration is actually higher in the
NAD-ME, PEP-CK, or mixed types relative to the exclusive
NADP-ME type is beyond the scope of this paper to quantify. To
bypass this complication, we used our unpublished data from four
PEP-CK species on theirΦ
CO2 measured using a gas mixture of 2%
O2 and 1000µmol mol−1 CO2; that is, under conditions in which
photorespiration is conceivably negligible.
Values of ΦCO2 (Table 2) were all lower than the theoretical
value 0.080 –0.081 mol mol−1 in Table 1 for the classically
deﬁned PEP-CK subtype. But they were slightly higher than the
values (0.060–0.067 mol mol
−1) reported in the literature for this
subtype (Ehleringer & Pearcy, 1983), suggesting that the gas
mixture indeed prevented the occurrence of photorespiration.
Since they are not lower than 0.064 mol mol−1, the theoretical
ΦCO2 for the ME subtypes, it is unlikely that PEP-phosphatase-
based conversion of PEP into pyruvate in BS cells played a
signiﬁcant role, although we cannot rule it out. For simplicity, we
set parameter a″ = 0 (see Fig. 1). Based on this value and other
input parameter values that are considered conserved (Table S2),
the calculated a depended slightly on the value ofn and varied
from 0 to 0.16, all lower than the minimum value for this
parameter of 0.25 deﬁning the classical PEP-CK subtype. This
means that, in order to meet the requirement of NH
2-ﬂux balance,
the fraction of OAA following the direct OAA decarboxylation by
PEP-CK was also from 0 to 0.16. The remaining dominant
fraction (> 0.68) was to perform either NADP-ME and NAD-
ME-based decarboxylation, or the PEP-CK decarboxylation
involving pyruvate kinase. Though we were unable to quantita-
tively separate the three (but see later section), our calculations
suggested that PEP-CK species might have substantial NAD(P)-
ME activity. Br¨autigam et al. (2014) did show that the NAD-ME
activity was 35% higher than the PEP-CK activity in the PEP-CK
species Panicum maximum. However, the current literature data
on the activities of the three decarboxylating enzymes in the PEP-
CK species (e.g. Hatch, 1987; Kanai & Edwards, 1999; Koteyava
et al., 2015; Br¨autigam et al., 2018; Sonawaneet al., 2018) suggest
that generally PEP-CK is still dominant over the other two
decarboxylating enzymes. So, most likely, the PEP-CK decar-
boxylation involving pyruvate kinase accounts for the third source
of CO
2 delivered to Rubisco.

Exploring theoretical margins to design an ideotype of
C4 photosynthesis
The model described in Notes S1 for calculating parametersa and
fCET can be used to explore theoretical margins for the optimum
combination ofa and fCET that gives the maximumΦCO2 within
the physiologically relevant range ofa and fCET. This is illustrated in
Fig. 2, where the physiologically relevant range is marked by the
red arrow. The lowestΦCO2 of this range is deﬁned bya = 0, which
means that the mixed type would become the classically deﬁned
NADP-ME or NAD-ME subtype. The maximumΦ
CO2 of this
range is deﬁned byfCET = 0, which gives the most efﬁcient mixed
type having the maximum ΦCO2 , and the equivalent value of
parameter a ≈ 0.36 if n = 3 (Fig. 2) or a ≈ 0.40 if n = 2.5.
Beyond this point,fCET would become negative. The NH2-ﬂux
balanced PEP-CK type (wherea = 0.5) discussed earlier actually
goes beyond this threshold that would need a negative
f
CET ≈− 0.44 (ifn = 3) orfCET ≈− 0.26 (ifn = 2.5). The logic
for negative fCET is that, with parameter a becoming higher,
NADPH in the M cell is overused for reducing OAA to malate such
that NADH oxidation and LET are both high, overproducing ATP
Fig. 1 A scheme illustrating multiple decarboxylating pathways of C4photosynthesis. A fraction of OAA produced by phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP)
carboxylation in the mesophyll (M) cells,a, is reduced to malate, which will move to the bundle-sheath (BS) mitochondria where malate is decarboxylated,
generating NADH that will drive the mitochondrial electron transport chain (mETC) and produce ATP. The remaining fraction of OAA in the M cells, (1− a),
follows various possible pathways: a fraction of this part of OAA (a0) follows the NAD-malic enzyme (ME) or NADP-ME decarboxylating pathway or the PEP-
carboxykinase (CK) pathway where the PEP generated will be converted to pyruvate in the BS cells by pyruvate kinase (PK)– the pathway denoted as PEP-CK
(PK); another fraction (a″) follows the PEP-CK pathway, where the PEP generated will be converted to pyruvate in the BS cells by PEP phosphatase (PP)– the
pathway denoted as PEP-CK(PP); and the remaining fraction, 1− a0 − a″, follows the classical PEP-CK pathway where the ATP required for PEP-CK may come
from the ATP generated from the aforementioned NADH-associated mETC. As discussed in the main text, the NH2-ﬂux balance associated with the PEP-CK
type would require thata = (1 − a)(1 − a0 − a″). The gross ATP requirements for each decarboxylating form can be formulated according to these fractions, as
indicated in the ﬁgure, where NAD-ME, NADP-ME, and PEP-CK(PK) all require two ATP per decarboxylation (for PEP regeneration by pyruvate, phosphate
dikinase), and therefore are lumped in the same category (but elsewhere in the text, and in Table 3 and Fig. 3, the fraction of this category for NADP-ME is
denoted asb). Summing individual gross ATP requirements up, deducting the ATP production by the NADH oxidation (which isna, wheren is the number of
ATP produced per NADH oxidation), would give the net ATP requirement for the whole C4cycle. Combining this with the NH2-balance equationa = (1 − a)
(1 − a0 − a″) and rearranging terms would give an equation describing net ATP requirement for the whole C4 cycle as 2+ a″ − (n + 1 + a″)a in this mixed
type.

that would need a negativefCET to balance the NADPH : ATP
ratio. As a negativefCET is obviously physiologically impossible, the
NH2-ﬂux balanced PEP-CK type (wherea = 0.5) discussed earlier
should not exist in nature.
The maximum ΦCO2 at fCET = 0 was 0.079 mol mol−1 (if
n = 3) or 0.078 mol mol−1 (n = 2.5), only slightly lower than
ΦCO2 of 0.080–0.081 mol mol−1, the value calculated for the
classically deﬁned PEP-CK subtype (Table 1). However, as
discussed earlier, the classically deﬁned PEP-CK subtype does
not meet the requirement for a balance of the NH
2-ﬂux between M
and BS cells. As a result, unlike the classically deﬁned NADP-ME or
NAD-ME subtypes (which are special cases whena = 0 in Fig. 2),
the classically deﬁned PEP-CK subtype cannot be a special case
along the curves shown in Fig. 2. As the type withf
CET = 0 (Fig. 2)
yields the highest ΦCO2 , we shall call it the C4 ideotype. This
ideotype, potentially as a mixture of three C4 subtypes, guarantees a
balanced NH2-ﬂux and a balanced NADPH : ATP ratio as
required by C3 and C4 cycles.
Can energy supply satisfy cell-type-speciﬁc energy
demand in the designed ideotype?
It is necessary to examine if NADPH and ATP requirements can be
met within M and BS cell types. To that end, we extended the cell-
type-speciﬁc models of Yin & Struik (2018) for light absorption,
energy production, and requirement for the mixed C
4 type as
deﬁned in Fig. 1 (Notes S2). We run this extended NADPH and
ATP production model for the C
4 ideotype with a = 0.36 (if
n = 3) ora = 0.40 (ifn = 2.5) anda″ = 0, using four sets of the
three input parameters: leaf Chl content [CHL], fraction of [CHL]
in BS cells, and fraction of photosystem I (PSI) in BS cells. These
four sets of inputs were taken from measurements of Ghannoum
et al. (2005) for two NADP-ME (sets I and II) and two NAD-ME
(sets III and IV) species. The model can identify the physiologically
relevant fraction of PSII in BS cells (Yin & Struik, 2018). Other
output parameters relevant for our analysis here are the fraction of
ATP production in BS cells and the fraction of NADPH
production in BS cells. None of these three output parameters
depended on the value ofn, so they are given in a single value for
each input set (Table 3). The model identiﬁed that the physiolog-
ically relevant fraction of PSII in BS cells had a single value and was
equal to the input fraction of PSI in BS cells. This is because the
proposed ideotype requires no CET; so, relative amounts of PSII in
either cell type should agree with the relative amounts of PSI to
perform LET only. For the same reason, the predicted fraction of
ATP production in BS cells equalled the predicted fraction of
NADPH production in BS cells (Table 3), as LET produces a ﬁxed
ATP : NADPH ratio.
We then analysed whether ATP and NADPH supply satisﬁes
cell-type-speciﬁc energy requirement in the C
4 ideotype, following
the same method as used by Yin & Struik (2018); that is, by
matching the fraction of ATP (NADPH) supply in BS cells with the
fraction of ATP (NADPH) demand in BS cells. The formulae for
the cell-type-speciﬁc demands are described in Table S3 (wherea″
should be set to zero for the ideotype). This matching gives rise to
what fraction of the 3-PGA reduction in BS cells would be needed.
Table S3 shows that the cell-type-speciﬁc ATP demand does not
depend on parameter b (fraction of the second category of
decarboxylation in Fig. 1 that is via NADP-ME) whereas the
NADPH demand does. So, we ﬁrst calculated the required fraction
of the 3-PGA reduction in BS cells to have the ATP supply and
demand in balance, indicated by the variableγ
atp. It varied from
0.35 to 0.73 whenn = 3 or from 0.29 to 0.67 whenn = 2.5
(Table 3). The higherγatp when n is higher was because higher ATP
supply from NADH oxidation in BS mitochondria can support a
higher fraction of 3-PGA reduction in BS chloroplasts; and the
transfer of ATP can be realized given available intracellular ATP
shuttles (Shameeret al., 2019). The signiﬁcantly higher fraction of

3-PGA reduction in BS cells in sets III and IV than in sets I and II
was due to higher fractions of [CHL] in BS cells in sets III and IV,
which enabled the capture of relatively more light energy and
therefore to produce relatively more ATP in BS cells (Table 3).
Assuming that γ
nadph (fraction of the 3-PGA reduction in BS
cells to have the NADPH supply and demand in balance) equalled
γ
atp, we were able to calculateb, which varied from−0.04 to 0.79
when n = 3 or from−0.65 to 0.48 whenn = 2.5, and the resulting
percentage of the NADP-ME pathway accounting for the total
decarboxylation was also calculated (Table 3). The higherb when
n = 3 was because thisn resulted in higherγ
atp, which, when setting
to be γnadph, would result in higher requirements for shuttling
malate from M to BS cells by the NADP-ME-dependent pathway.
Negative values ofb and NADP-ME%, as occurred for sets I and II
(Table 3), are physiologically impossible; their occurrence merely
suggests that the input parameter value for the fraction of [CHL] in
BS cells in set I and probably also in set II was not sufﬁciently high
to realize the proposed C
4 ideotype. Assuming b = 0, we
recalculated γnadph. Compared withγatp, theγnadph obtained was
higher in cases whereb was earlier found to be less than zero, but
lower in cases whereb was greater than zero (Table 3). 3-PGA as the
product of RuBP carboxylation is produced in BS cells. Its
reduction involves an intercellular shuttle (Hatch, 1987), during
which 3-PGA is ﬁrst transformed to 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate by
phosphoglycerate kinase (the step that requires ATP) and then
reduced to triose phosphate by glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate
dehydrogenase (the step that requires NADPH). Higherγ
atp than
γnadph, as calculated for sets III and IV, indicates the possibility that,
relative to the second step, the ﬁrst step occurs more in BS than in M
cells. However, it is impossible to reconcile with a higherγnadph than
γatp, as calculated mostly for sets I and II, again suggesting that the
proposed C4 ideotype cannot be achieved with a low [CHL]
fraction in BS cells.
Our model analysis herein suggests that cellular energy produc-
tion can satisfy cell-type-speciﬁc ATP and NADPH requirement in
the C
4 ideotype, provided that the fraction [CHL] in BS cells is
greater thanc. 0.4 and the proportion of 3-PGA reduction in BS
cells and, optionally, the proportion of NADP-ME operation can
adjust accordingly. The latter suggests an approach to estimate a
maximum NADP-ME% in total decarboxylation (Table 3).
Advantages of the C4 ideotype over the NADP-ME type
at the canopy level of a crop
Finally, we evaluated whether the proposed C4 ideotype can indeed
have advantages over the current crop C 4 type (NADP-ME
subtype) in a canopy and crop setting. To evaluate that, we run the
crop model G
ECROS (Yin & Struik, 2017), for which we revised its
C4 submodel based on the algorithms developed here for the
proposed C4 ideotype (see Notes S3). We set the fraction of PSII in
BS cellsα = 0.10 for the crop C4 type as observed in maize and
α = 0.40 for the C4 ideotype, the general value for the PEP-CK
subtype (von Caemmerer & Furbank, 1999). We used the 31 yr
(1980–2010) weather data of the International Rice Research
Institute (in the Philippines), with GECROS input crop parameters
as described by Yin & Struik (2017).
The simulated 31 yr average advantage of the crop type C4
(NADP-ME) over the C3 rice in radiation use efﬁciency was
36.3%, and the advantage of the proposed C4 ideotype wasc. 50%
when n = 3 and c. 48% when n = 2.5 (Table 4). Simulated
advantages in total biomass all became somewhat higher, because
an increased leaf area index was simulated as a consequence of the
increased photosynthesis or radiation use efﬁciency, resulting in
somewhat higher light interception during growing seasons. The
advantage of the crop C
4 type was 42%, whereas that of the
proposed C4 ideotype was always>50% (Table 4). The required
increase ofα in the ideotype relative to the NADP-ME subtype is
expected to increase photorespiration, but the impact of varyingα
on simulated advantages was small (results not shown). That was
probably because, in the simulation, we assumed that the BS
conductance (that determines the CO
2 leakage) in the proposed C4
ideotype was as small as that found for the NADP-ME species,
where decarboxylation occurs predominantly in chloroplasts.
Whether or not this conductance becomes higher in the NAD-
ME (decarboxylation in mitochondria) subtype and the PEP-CK
subtype (decarboxylation in cytosol and mitochondria) is an
important subject to investigate, although PEP-CK has been
expressed to localize in chloroplasts of transgenic rice plants (Suzuki
et al., 2000).
Concluding remarks
C4 crops of agricultural importance all belong to the NADP-ME
subtype. Whether there is any causality behind this or whether it is
just the coincidence of domestication is an interesting question to
investigate. However, operating the CCM cycle in either NADP-
ME or NAD-ME subtypes is energetically expensive, accounting
for at least 40% of total ATP cost for CO
2 assimilation. Yin &
Struik (2017) showed that the crop C4 type, if being introduced
into C3 crops, would not be able to increase yield by 50%, the
initially expected yield advantage of C4 rice (Mitchell & Sheehy,
2006). We therefore proposed a C 4 ideotype by exploring
theoretically lower energy requirements in the nondomesticated
PEP-CK subtype.

The ideotype is the special form of the general mixed NAD(P)-
ME and PEP-CK (Fig. 1) that results in the maximumΦCO2
(Fig. 2). The general mixed type considers the balance of the NH2
groups between M and BS cells and the balance of NADPH and
ATP as the metabolically required ratio. The classically deﬁned
PEP-CK subtype is not a special form of our general type, because it
does not satisfy the ﬁrst balance; neither is the NH
2-ﬂux balanced
type discussed earlier, as it does not satisfy the second balance.
However, the other two classical subtypes are special cases of the
general type. As species traditionally classiﬁed as NADP-ME or
NAD-ME types often have some PEP-CK (Furbank, 2011), which
can even be induced to increase by environmental changes (e.g.
Sales et al., 2018), our general type may be considered as a uniﬁed
scheme of C
4 subtypes (Fig. 3).
The proposed C4 ideotype does not need CET under low
irradiances; so, probably few modiﬁcations of electron transport
machinery are required because C3 photosynthesis involves little
CET. Furthermore, the PEP-CK is present in C3 plants although it
is responsible for nonphotosynthetic functions (Leegood &
Walker, 2003), and genes encoding the evolution of C
4 PEP-CK
have been reported (Christinet al., 2009). However, the required
engagement of multiple biochemical pathways (Fig. 3) might pose
a challenge to engineering. Moreover, the required proportion of
[CHL] in BS cells needs to be higher than that found in current C
4
crop species, and the vein spacing in C3 leaves may not allow the
housing of sufﬁcient chloroplasts in BS cells (Karkiet al., 2013;
Ermakova et al., 2020). Wanget al. (2017) reported that transgenic
rice lines expressing Golden-like transcription factor genes from
maize displayed increased numbers and volumes of differentiated
chloroplasts, and accumulated more [CHL], in BS and mestome
sheath cells of the leaf. As long as the required [CHL] in BS cells can
be reached, there are a range of options to achieve cellular energy
balance of both ATP and NADPH; for example, via adjusted
proportion of 3-PGA reduction in two cell types and adjusted
engagement of the NADP-ME pathway (Table 3).
The required value of parametera (proportion of OAA reduced
to malate in M cells for malate decarboxylation via NAD-ME to
drive mitochondrial electron transport) for the C
4 ideotype was
c. 0.36 or 0.40. This is higher than the 0.25 or 0.286 required for
the classically deﬁned PEP-CK subtype (Hatch, 1987; Kanai &
Edwards, 1999; Ishikawaet al., 2016). As stated, the classical PEP-
CK type does not meet the NH
2 balance and, thus, should not exist
in nature. We do not know yet if there are C4 species in nature that
are physiologically the same as, or close to, the deﬁned C4 ideotype.
Carnal et al. (1993) reported that maximum rates of malate
decarboxylation via NAD-ME substantially exceeded the
Fig. 3 The proposed mixed type of C4 photosynthesis, and its NADPH and ATP requirements per CO2 assimilation in mesophyll (M) and bundle-sheath (BS)
cells. The red arrows show the Calvin cycle and its cell-type-speciﬁc NADPH and ATP requirements; the blue arrows show the C4 cycle, where the full arrows
show the cycle in the classically deﬁned phosphoenol pyruvate (PEP)-carboxykinase (CK) subtype (see Supporting Information Fig. S1c; reprinted by
permission from Springer Nature, Ishikawaet al., 2016) and the dashed ones show the new components added to form the mixed type. For illustrative simplicity,
it is assumed that there is no leakiness, that the 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PGA) reduction of the Calvin cycle occurs in 50% in each of the two cell types, and that
the PEP-CK pathway where the PEP generated is converted to pyruvate in the BS cells possibly by PEP phosphatase (PP)– the pathway denoted as PEP-CK(PP) in
Fig. 1– does not occur (for detailed algorithms for energy requirement without these assumptions, see Table S3). The coefﬁcienta refers to the fraction of OAA
produced by PEP carboxylation in the M cells that is reduced to malate moving to the BS mitochondria where malate decarboxylation generates NADH that will
drive mitochondrial electron transport to produce ATP. This producesna ATP (wheren is the ATP : NADH ratio). The coefﬁcientb is the fraction of the second
decarboxylation category deﬁned in Fig. 1that belongs to the NADP-malic enzyme (ME) type. Ifa = 0 andb = 1, then the mixed type becomes the NADP-ME
subtype (see Fig. S1a); ifa = 0 andb = 0, then the mixed type becomes the NAD-ME subtype (see Fig. S1b). Another special case ifa = 0 andb = 0i sa

minimum rates necessary for providing ATP for cytosolic OAA
decarboxylation by PEP-CK. This suggests that PEP-CK species
having high proportions (close to 0.36 or 0.40) of OAA reduced to
malate in M cells for malate decarboxylation via NAD-ME may
actually exist, although they may not necessarily have a highΦ
CO2 .
Reasons for the lowΦCO2 in PEP-CK species need to be examined
in conjunction with our aforementioned hypotheses.
Photosynthetic ΦCO2 is known to be recalcitrant to genetic
improvement in both C 3 and C 4 types. However, canopy
photosynthesis after canopy closure generally depends more on
Φ
CO2 than on Amax (Day & Chalabi, 1988; Guet al., 2014),
especially given recent molecular evidence that electron transport is
a major limitation to photosynthesis in C4 plants (Ermakovaet al.,
2019). Our viewpoints provide a (theoretical) case whereΦCO2
could be improved, thereby potentially paving a new way of
redesigning and supercharging photosynthesis. If this is proven
either from exploiting natural variations or by a synthetic biology
approach, it would provide a new C
4 template not only for being
introduced into C3 crops but also for improving current C4 crops.
