In brief
To identify useful biocatalytic enzymes in
the vastness of sequence space,
biosynthetic clusters with potential
promiscuous activities for prospecting
imine reductases (IREDs) like enzymes
were deﬁned. This approach guided the
screening of 44 biosynthetic enzymes
from six distinct non-homologous
enzyme families, of which 46% showed
activity and useful substrate scope for
potential synthetic applications. These
functional annotations based on
experimental observations provide useful
bridgeheads in previously unknown
sequence space, provide practical
guidelines for where to look for this type
of activity, and increase conﬁdence in
further sequence-based annotations that
are now more ﬁrmly anchored to actual
observations.

SUMMARY
Imine reductases (IREDs) are invaluable catalysts for enantioselective imine reduction and reductive amina-
tion of carbonyl compounds. Their synthetic versatility is, however, limited by their substrate scope, and new
IREDs are needed. Current IREDs are closely related to the initially characterized enzymes, as their discovery
has been driven by sequence homology searches. Here, we demonstrate afunctional genomics approach
based on biosynthetic promiscuity, guided by the identiﬁcation of C=N reducing enzymes acting on large,
complex substrates in biosynthetic pathways. These substrate-promiscuous biocatalysts share low homol-
ogy to existing IREDs and fall into distinct functional enzyme families, yet they catalyze the hydrogenation of
non-native imines as well as the reductive amination of simple ketones. Venturing further into sequence
space without the constraints of close homology, but instead guided by functional promiscuity, has thus
led us to distinct, previously unrecognized and unexplored areas of sequence space for mining IREDs for
synthesis.
INTRODUCTION
Imine reductases (IREDs) have emerged as important members
of the catalyst toolkit for the synthesis of chiral amine building
blocks. IREDs (including the closely related subclass of reduc-
tive aminases [RedAms]) catalyze the NAD(P)H-dependent
enantioselective reduction of imines and reductive amination of
carbonyl compounds, allowing access to primary, secondary,
and tertiary chiral amines.
1,2 Compared with other conven-
tional methods (e.g., chemo-catalytic and transaminase-based
routes), IRED-catalyzed reductive amination reactions often
enable greener and shorter synthetic routes to 2 /C14and 3 /C14chiral
amines by providing a direct and selective pathway to these
amines without a further N-alkylation step.
3,4 A transaminase
route, for instance, can only form 1 /C14amines, and further N-alkyl-
ation step(s) and toxic reagents are required to access the
corresponding 2
/C14and 3 /C14amine derivatives. 5 Abiotic reductive
amination reactions, on the other hand, suffer from poor
THE BIGGER PICTURE Making enzymatic synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) sustainable
and attractive for industrial applications requires a repertoire of enzymes with activities and selectivities that
surpass those of chemical synthesis methods. Reductive amination (RA) is one of the most frequently em-
ployed methods to synthesize amine-based APIs, so the use of imine reductases (IREDs) for this transforma-
tion is extremely attractive: catalytic reactions are performed with high efﬁciency and high stereoselectivity
under mild conditions. Secondary and tertiary amines that are not accessible by other enzymatic methods
can be synthesized in this way. However, the versatility of IRED-catalyzed reductive amination is limited
by their substrate scope, so new IREDs to bridge gaps in speciﬁcity will increase the broad application of
IREDs. Here, we explore a functional genomic approach to retrieve and characterize enzymes catalyzing un-
related physiological imine reduction reactions across several metabolic routes, revealing their promiscuity
for the reductive amination of synthetic substrates. Our work has uncovered six useful enzyme families for
imine reduction in previously unannotated sequence space, where their functional assignment creates
‘‘bridgeheads’’ for further searches for IREDs.

stereoselectivity and often yield the target products as racemic
mixtures or in sub-optimal optical purity that require a further
and tedious chiral resolution of the enantiomers. In addition,
chemical reductive amination methods employing stoichio-
metric amounts of reducing reagents (such as NaBH
4,
NaBH(OAc)3, and NaBH 3CN) produce large quantities of unde-
sired boronic or cyanide by-products. 6 Specialized and poten-
tially hazardous equipment setups and high catalyst loadings
are usually necessary in transition-metal-catalyzed reductive
amination reactions where hydrogenation is performed with di-
hydrogen gas (using H
2/transition metal systems).
Since chiral amines are among the most important building
blocks in the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients
(APIs), asymmetric amine-forming catalytic systems such as
those afforded by IREDs are highly sought after. Recent examples
of successful industrial exploitation of IRED/RedAm technol-
ogy
7–10 demonstrate considerable interest in this enzyme family.
This translational success fuels the motivation to establish the bio-
catalytic IRED route as a mainstream method of choice for the
asymmetric reductive amination of carbonyl compounds. To
realize this ambition, the narrow substrate scope of IREDs must
be signiﬁcantly expanded, as several frequently used reductive
amination substrates, such as aromatic/bulky ketones and
amines, are only poorly tolerated by existing IRED toolkits.
1,11,12
This problem notwithstanding, the effort devoted to the char-
acterization of synthetically useful IREDs has been remarkable,
with several academic and industry groups contributing to the
ﬁeld. These efforts have, over the past decade, yielded hundreds
of experimentally characterized IREDs ( Figure 1A). The availabil-
ity of Streptomyces’ IREDs as query sequences, identiﬁed
through the screening of microbial cultures,
13–15 paved the
way for several genome mining IRED discovery projects in which
putative bacterial homologs were identiﬁed by sequence homol-
ogy and experimentally validated. 16–22 Through sequence ho-
mology search, several homologs of the characterized enzymes
were assembled to construct the IRED Engineering Database. 23
Others have assessed the distribution of IREDs across different
taxa, opening up fungal, plant, and metazoan IRED sequence
space.1,11,22 Lastly, a sequence-based metagenomic approach
has recently been explored to further expand the IRED
toolbox
24,25 (Figure 1 A). The aforementioned IRED discovery
strategies have relied on sequence homology to the extent that
the vast majority of known IREDs are closely related, homolo-
gous proteins. The narrowly deﬁned sequence window implies
that they share similar functional, catalytic, or synthetic proper-
ties and limitations or potential for directed evolution. It is, there-
fore, not surprising that the hugely expanded IRED toolbox has
not yet translated to a signiﬁcant extension of the substrate
scope of this enzyme class, highlighting the need for a discovery
effort that is not driven by sequence homology alone but instead
primarily by function. Exploration of alternative enzyme families
that catalyze imine reduction has been considered with some
promising results,
22,26,27 but an extensive functional investiga-
tion of multiple distinct enzyme families for biocatalytic applica-
tion as IREDs is not on record.
This work addresses whether IREDs can be found using a
sequence-independent strategy to reveal functional proteins in
phylogenetically distinct sequence space that transcends the
currently narrow sequence deﬁnition of contemporary IREDs.
Speciﬁcally, our strategy explores enzymes that have been
shown to reduce theC=N bond of biosynthetic intermediates in
different biosynthetic/metabolic pathways across almost all
clades of life. Even though biosynthetic enzymes are often
perceived to display strict substrate speciﬁcity toward their
native substrates,
28–31 catalytic and substrate promiscuity is a
recognized, intrinsic property of many enzymes that allow
them to act on alternative substrates, as an evolutionary ‘‘head
start’’ en route to the acquisition of a new function after gene
duplication.
32–34 Here, we systematically explore whether such
C=N bond-reducing enzymes are promiscuous toward non-
native imine substrates relevant for IRED applications and
whether this search, only driven by a functional but not
sequence-deﬁned search proﬁle, would uncover novel IREDs
in areas of sequence space that is remote from the current clus-
ter of known IREDs. Our approach involves (1) the selection of
functionally and phylogenetically divergent enzyme families
based on their recorded physiological role as NAD(P)H-depen-
dent C=N reductases in the literature, regardless of sequence
homology, (2) a preference for reductases that work on relatively
large substrate molecules in the center of which the C=N reduc-
tion occurs (to bias for a large binding site able to accept bulky
IRED substrates, for which few catalysts exist), and (3) experi-
mental testing of recruited sequences per each selected func-
tional family to determine the number of hits for each selected
functional family, their activity, and their stereoselectivity. For
each selected family, an average of seven sequences with vary-
ing degrees of sequence identity (35%–80%) were screened.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Construction of a diverse enzyme collection
We identiﬁed a panel of 44 phylogenetically diverse C=N
reducing enzymes covering a wide range of functional families,
each with distinct native imine substrate speciﬁcity ( Figures 1 B
and S1; Table S1 ; supplemental information ). Speciﬁcally the
panel comprises enzymes acting on pterin 1 and pteridine 2
such as (1) dihydrofolate reductases (DHFRs) and (2) pteridine
reductases (PTR1s; PruAs), respectively; (3) short-chain dehy-
drogenases (SDRs) catalyzing C=N bond (instead of C=O)
reduction in the biosynthesis of plant alkaloids, e.g., norcraugso-
dine 3
35–39; and (4) bacterial enzymes including naphthyridino-
mycin biosynthetic enzyme (NAPW) and homologs catalyzing
C=N reduction of the iminium precursors of tetrahydroisoquino-
line (THIQ) antibiotics, e.g., naphthyridinomycin iminium 4.
40
Others include (5) imino acid reductases such as those cata-
lyzing C=N reduction in the metabolism of acyclic imino acids,
e.g., iminosuccinate 5,
28,41 as well as those catalyzing the red-
uction of cyclic imino acids, e.g., 1-peperideine/pyrroline-2-
carboxylate 6.42–44 (6) Lastly, representatives of the ‘‘classical’’
IRED family catalyzing imine reduction in biosynthetic pathways.
For example, RedE, an uncharacterized metagenomic IRED-like
biosynthetic enzyme acting on pyrrole/pyrrolinium indolocarba-
zole core 7, a precursor of tryptophan dimer natural product,

as well as related homologs from Antarctica (from Mortierella
antarctica [MaRedAm]) and a tropical habitat (from a metage-
nomic bacterium [ BacRedAm]).

Representative sequences for each clade were chosen and

(see supplemental information for gene sequences). These plas-
mids were each expressed in E. coliBL21(DE3) to produce re-
combinant whole-cell biocatalysts ( supplemental information ;
Figures S20 and S21). A preliminary screening for NAD(P)H-
dependent imine-reducing activity was performed by monitoring
the high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) conversion
of the imine 1-methyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline 8 to the corre-
sponding amine 9 and/or bioreduction of myosmine 10 to norni-

E. coli cells in lysozyme-based lysis buffer
(pH 7.0). These substrates have been cho-
sen for an initial afﬁrmation of IRED function
because, empirically, the majority of syn-
thetically useful IREDs have been found to
reduce isoquinoline and pyrroline imines. In
addition, isoquinolines and pyrrolidines are
prevalent motifs in many pharmaceuticals.
Analysis of biotransformation reactions
revealed that /C2460% of the biosynthetic en-
zymes from functionally diverse classes dis-
played imine-reducing activity on one or
both non-native imine substrates 8 and 10
(Figure 2 B), although group-speciﬁc hit
rates ranged from 0% to 100%. Of the eight
members investigated from clade 1 (REDE
homologs, the classical IREDs), all displayed
imine-reducing activity toward 8 or 10,
representing a 100% hit rate. In contrast,
only two members, PjDHFR from Pneumo-
cystis jirovecii (fungal) and GgDHFR from Gallus gallus (avian),
of the eight screened from clade 2 (DHFRs) displayed weak
imine-reducing activity toward 8, equivalent to a 25% hit rate.
87% (13) of the 15 members of clade 3 (PTR1s, norcraugsodine
reductases [NRs], and NAPW-like enzymes) converted either 8
or 10 to the corresponding amine. The protozoan PTR1s and
NRs from plants afforded moderate conversions, with the other
hits in this clade only displaying weak activity ( Figure 2 B).
Six members of clades 4 and 5 were screened, but no detect-
able product was observed under the biotransformation condi-
tions based on HPLC analysis. For clades 6a and 6c (imino
acid reductases), six members were also screened, of which
66% displayed weak imine-reducing activity toward 8. These
include the acyclic imino acid reductase PunC5/BsP5 from Pae-
nibacillus sp./Bacillus sp., iminosuccinate reductase PbBcHD
from Paracoccus denitriﬁcans, and the mammalian ketimine
reductase mu-crystallin (CRYM). It is worth mentioning that

some of these enzymes (e.g., DHFRs, NAPW, PunC5, BsP5)
were unstable and enzymatic imine-reducing activity appears
to vary with each enzyme batch. Native amine dehydrogenases
(NatAmDHs) that form a distinct branch (6b) within clade 6 were
excluded from this study, as signiﬁcant effort has recently been
devoted to their biocatalytic exploitation.

Using semi-puriﬁed enzyme preparations, we examined the
stereoselectivity of selected representatives of clades 1, 2, 3,
and 6 toward the reduction of imines 8 and 10 (Table 1 ). RedE
displayed weak activity toward 8 but efﬁciently reduced myos-
mine 10 to the corresponding S-nornicotine 11 (90% conv.,
>99% enantiomeric excess [ e.e.]), while related homologs
MaRedAm, BacRedAm, and and the reductive aminase from
Aspergillus sergii (AserRedAm) efﬁciently reduced 8 to the ( R)-
amine 9 (>99% conv., 48%–92% e.e.). BacRedAm and MaRe-
dAm also efﬁciently converted 10 to the ( S)-amine (>99%
conv.), whereas AserRedAm displayed weaker activity toward
this substrate.
Protozoan PTR1s from kinetoplastid parasites, including from
Trypanosoma brucei (TbPTR1), T. cruzi (TcPTR1), Leishmania
major (LmPTR1), and L. tarentolae (LtPTR1), reduced both 8
and 10. While LmPTR1 and TbPTR1 reduced 8 to the corre-
sponding ( S)-9, albeit in moderate to low e.e. (13%–54% e.e.),
TcPTR1 and LtPTR1 produced the corresponding ( R)-amine in
excellent enantioselectivity (up 96% e.e.). The PTR1s all yielded
the ( R)-11 from the reduction of 10,
irrespective of their selec-
tivity toward amine 9. The avian DHFR ( GgDHFR) reduced 8 to
(R)-9 (97% conv., >98% e.e.), but no conversion of 9 to 10 could
be detected.
The plant alkaloid-forming biosynthetic enzyme NR ( NpNR
from Narcissus pseudonarcissus), which has been previously
investigated for imine reduction of other cyclic imine sub-
strates,19 and homologs from Zephyranthes treatiae(ZtNR) and
Lycoris radiata (LrNR) afforded high conversion of 8 to ( R)-9,
albeit with poor e.e. values. However, ZtNR and NpNR displayed
stereo-complementary selectivity for the reduction of imine 10,
yielding ( S)-11 (30% e.e.) and ( R)-11 (28% e.e.), respectively.
An alkaloid-forming bacterial dehydrogenase, NAPW-like pro-
tein from Paenibacillus sp. ( PbSDR), formed ( S)-11 from 10
(68% conv., 91% e.e.). Representatives of (a)cyclic imino acid
reductase, including Homo sapiens ketimine reductase mu-crys-
tallin (hsCRYM), Punc5, and imminosuccinate reductase ( b- hy-
droxyaspartate cyclodeaminase from Paracoccus denitriﬁcans,
PdBhCD), yielded ( R)-9 with near-perfect selectivity (>98%
e.e.); however, substrate 10 was barely converted by hsCRYM
and PunC5 (<3% conv.). Control reactions with stoichiometric
amounts of NAD(P)H conﬁrmed the IRED activity and showed
a similar trend to the observed activity when using a glucose de-
hydrogenase (GDH)-recycling system (see supplemental infor-
mation and Table S2 ).
All the enzymes investigated in this work displayed a prefer-
ence for NADPH, although NADH was also accepted, and in
some cases, e.g., MaRedAm, LtPTR1, ZtNR, and AmIRED,
showed comparable conversion with both cofactors. The pH
proﬁle for the imine-reducing activity of selected enzymes
showed optimal activity at pH between 6 and 7, with most of
the enzymes also maintaining high activity at pH 5 (see supple-
mental information and Figure S6 ). Activity at weakly acidic pH
can be useful when handling substrates that are labile at basic
pH7 and in cascade reactions involving (de)carboxylases. 50,51
To further examine the synthetic potential of members of PTR1
and NR families and benchmarking against members of the clas-
sical IRED family, we performed biotransformations at higher
substrate loading for the reduction of cyclic imines 8 (100 mg
preparative scale, 25 mM, 28 mL reaction) and 10 (25 mM,
1 mL reaction), as well as for bulkier imines, salsolidine imine
12 (10 mM, 1 mL reaction) and harmaline 14 (10 mM, 1 mL reac-
tion) ( Table 1 B). At this elevated substrate loading, the PTR1s,
NRs, and IREDs retained moderate to high conversion values
for imines 8 and 10 (32% to >99% conv.) to the corresponding
enantioenriched products 9 and 11 (Table 1 B). Isolated yields
and e.e. values for the preparative-scale reactions for the reduc-
tion 8 to ( R)-9 were 92% yield, 95% e.e.; 25% yield, 98% e.e.;
and 30% yield, 24% e.e. for MaRedAm-catalyzed, LtPTR1-
catalyzed, and ZtNR-catalyzed reactions, respectively. For the
reduction of imines 12 and 14, a difference in substrate tolerance
could be observed within members of the same family. For
example, LtPTR1 showed moderate conversion (41%) toward
12, yielding ( R)-13 (>98% e.e.), but only weak or trace activity
could be detected with TbPTR1 and LmPTR1 with the same sub-
strate. Harmaline 14 was reduced to the corresponding amine
(S)-15, albeit in low conversion values (6%–18%).
The plant enzyme Z tPTR1 was efﬁcient toward the reduction
of salsolidine imine 12 (>99% conv., 38% e.e. [ S]) and harmaline
14 (97% conv., 89% e.e. [R]), while NpNR displayed a slower
conversion rate with these substrates. Similar trends were
observed with the classical IREDs. MaRedAm efﬁciently reduced
imine 12, affording the corresponding amine ( R)-13 (>99% conv.,
>98% e.e.), but displayed poor activity toward imine 25
(6% conv.). In contrast, BacRedAm reduced 14 to form ( S)-15
in excellent conversion and e.e. (93% conv., 98% e.e.) but only
showed weak activity toward the reduction of imine 12.
The protein sequence space shown to harbor enzymes with
imine-reducing activity from this work extends far beyond the
classical deﬁnition of the IRED sequence space. For example,
sequences included in the IRED Engineering Database ( www.
ired.biocatnet.de), which provides the most extensive coverage
of currently known IREDs (>1,400 sequences), fall in their entirety
under clade 1 ( Figure 2A).
23 Indeed, a BLAST search against this
database using any member of clade 1 as a query sequence re-
turns hits with signiﬁcant homology scores. However, a similar
homology search using representative sequences of all other
clades 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 scanned against the IRED Engineering
Database did not return any hits, indicating that the ﬁve other
distinct enzyme families (clades) described here cover new
ground: i.e., are sequence diverse and phylogenetically distinct
from known IREDs. This test suggests that the new clades will
provide the basis for a signiﬁcant extension of IRED diversity
by functional annotation of proteins in sequence space that act
on synthetic imine substrates as IREDs or provide a starting
point for their directed evolution.

amination

Hence, alongside members of clade 1, we examined the perfor-
mance of representative members of clade 3 toward the reductive
amination of simple cyclic ketones (cyclohexanone 16, cyclohep-
tanone 17, cyclopentanone 18, cyclobutanone 19, 4-phenylcy-
clohexanone 20) with alkylamines (propargylamine a,c y c l o p r o -
pylamine b, methylamine c) and ammonia, d (Table 2).
MaRedAm-catalyzed reductive amination of carbonyls 16–19
(50 mM) with alkylamines a, b, and c (2 equiv.) afforded high con-
version ( 16a–16c, 95% to >99% conv.; 17a–17c, 50%–98%

conv., 18a–18c, 53%–94% conv., 19a and 19c, 74%–89%
conv.), and comparable conversion values were obtained with
BacRedAm (Table 2). Similar conversion values were also obse-
rved with 4-phenylcyclohexanone 20 (10 mM), with MaRedAm
and BacRedAm efﬁciently coupling amines a and c to form the
corresponding amine products 20a (89%–93% conv.) and 20c
(71%–80% conv.), respectively.
Members of the PTR1s (clade 3c) displayed similar substrate
tolerance to MaRedAm and BacRedAm. LtPTR1, in many cases,
afforded comparable conversion values with the prototype
RedAms (e.g., 16a, 78% conv.; 17a, 87% conv.; 18a, 82%
conv.; 19a, 45% conv.; 20a, 53% conv.), whereas TbPTR1 and
LmPTR1 yielded these products but in lower conversion values.
Other alkylamines, such as cyclopropylamine b and methylamine
c, were also accepted by LtPTR1 as amine nucleophiles,
furnishing the corresponding amine products in modest conver-
sion values. MaRedAm-catalyzed amination of 16 (50 mM) with
NH3 d (supplied as 200 mM NH 4Cl) afforded 90% conv. to the pri-
mary amine 16d, while conversion values were signiﬁcantly lower
with BacRedAm ( 16d, 15% conv.) and LtPTR1 ( 16d, 8% conv.).
These enzymes also formed 4-phenylcyclohexylamine 20d
from 4-phenylcyclohexanone 20 and NH 3, d (20d, MaRedAm,
32% conv.; BacRedAm, 30% conv.; and LtPR1, 14% conv.).
The plant enzymes (clade 3b) ZtNR and NpNR displayed activ-
ity toward the amination of 16–18 with propargylamine a, afford-
ing the corresponding N-alkylated propargylamine products
16a–18a, albeit with signiﬁcantly lower conversion values. How-
ever, both enzymes could not use ammonia or the small alkyl-
amine MeNH 2 and showed weak activity toward amination of
16 with cyclopropylamine b (ZtNR, 16b, 5% conv.) ( Table 2 ).
Preparative-scale biotransformation reactions for the amina-
tion of cyclohexanone 16 (100 mg, 1.02 mmol, total reaction vol-
ume, 41 mL) with 2 equiv of propargylamine a were performed,
yielding the corresponding secondary amine 16a (84% yield
for MaRedAm-catalyzed reaction and 63% yield for LtPTR1-
catalyzed reaction).
To examine the pattern of substrate speciﬁcity for both
carbonyl and amine coupling partners, we carefully constructed
a small substrate panel containing ketones 16 and 22, aldehyde
21, a-keto ester 23, and a-keto acids 24 and 25 as carbonyl ac-
ceptors, and propargylamine a, cyclopropylamine b, methyl-
amine c, and ammonia d were included as the amine coupling
partners (Table 3). Using puriﬁed enzyme preparation, represen-
tative members of clades 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 were each screened
against the various substrate combinations of this substrate
panel, monitoring the NADPH-dependent reductive amination
initial rate at 340 nm using a microtiter plate reader ( Table 3 ).
MaRedAm (clade 1) was the most versatile of these catalysts,
displaying high to moderate activity for the ketone/aldehyde
and alkylamine combinations, with speciﬁc activity of up to
11.6 U mg
/C01. MaRedAm-catalyzed reductive amination activity
was one order of magnitude lower when ammonia was used
instead of alkylamines ( Table 3). MaRedAm also exhibited reduc-
tive amination activity toward the a-keto ester 23 and a-keto
acids, 24 and 25, albeit two orders of magnitude slower relative
to the rates observed with cyclohexanone/hydrocinnamalde-
hyde and alkylamines. LtPR1, a representative from clade 3c,
showed similar amine speciﬁcity to MaRedAm. However, reac-
tion velocities were 10- to 100-fold slower when compared
with MaRedAm for the same substrate combinations. Activity to-
ward a-keto acids was not detected under the screening condi-
tions. Pseudomonas putida ketimine reductase ( PpDpka)
showed similar amine substrate speciﬁcity to MaRedAm but
distinct speciﬁcity for the carbonyl acceptor. PpDpka exhibited
high speciﬁc activity toward the amination of a-keto ester 23
and a-keto acids 24 and 25 with alkylamines (up to 5 U mg /C01);
activity toward ketones 16 and 22 and aldehyde 21 was not de-
tected under the conditions of this assay. HsCRYM (clade 6c),
PunC5 (clade 6a), and the avian DHFR ( GgDHFR, clade 6a) dis-
played activity for a-keto acids/esters with alkylamines and, in
some cases, ammonia (e.g., PunC5); however, methylamine c
was the preferred alkylamine nucleophile for these substrates.
The screening against this carefully designed, albeit small,
substrate panel has revealed that several non-homologous
enzyme families investigated can catalyze reductive amination
with primary amines to form N-alkylamines, N-alkylamino esters,
and N-alkylamino acids ( Table 3 ). Hence constructing IRED
panels to contain representative members from these distinct
and non-homologous enzyme families should signiﬁcantly
extend the amine product scope that can be accessed
compared to conventional IRED kits.
To demonstrate the utility of observed activities for biotrans-
formation reactions, we focused on PTR1s and NRs (again
benchmarking against the classical IREDs in clade 1) for the
reductive amination of hydrocinnamaldehyde 21 (30 mM), benz-
aldehyde 26 (10 mM), and a prochiral ketone, 4-phenyl-2-
butanone 22 (10 mM). PTR1s efﬁciently catalyzed the amination
of hydrocinnamaldehyde with propargylamine a to form the cor-
responding secondary amine coupling product 21a (54%–95%
conv.) as well as the coupling of benzaldehyde 17 with a, yielding
norpargyline 26a (up to >99% conv.). However, PTR1s only
showed low conversion (up to 6%) when tasked with the amina-
tion 4-phenyl-2-butanone 22 with propargylamine a or allylamine
e. Similarly, NRs catalyzed the amination benzaldehyde 26 with a
to afford the corresponding amine 26a in high conversion (up
>99%) but displayed weak amination for hydrocinnamaldehyde
21 and only trace activity for the amination of 22. In contrast, the
classical IREDs/RedAms performed well across these sub-
strates, affording high conversion of up to >99%. For the reduc-
tive amination of ketone 22 with amines a or e, the (R)-conﬁgured
amine products ((R)-22a, and (R)-22e) were generated with mod-
erate to high enantioselectivity of up to 95% e.e. Although this
preliminary screen shows that PTR1s and NRs are suitable for
the amination of aromatic aldehydes and simple cyclic ketones
and less efﬁcient for the amination of (aromatic) ketones, an
extensive substrate proﬁling study is needed to map out the
distinctive substrate speciﬁcities of PTR1s and NRs, as well as
the other enzyme families described in this work.
The classical IREDs emerged as the most versatile of these
enzyme families for synthetic application in the reductive amina-
tion of ketones. Hence, we further investigated the efﬁciency of
the novel IREDs/RedAms identiﬁed in this work ( Table S1 ) to-
ward the amination of difﬁcult-to-aminate bicyclic aromatic
ketones such as 1-indanone 27 and 1-tetralone 28. The syn-
thesis of a-secondary amines from bicyclic aromatic ketones
represents one of the most challenging reactions for existing

attractive, as corresponding amine products formed from this re-
action are prevalent in pharmaceutical drugs. To this end, we
screened 9 members of clade 1 (classical IREDs) for the amina-
tion of 27 with methylamine c, revealing BacRedAm, MaRedAm,
and AserRedAm as the best-performing members of this clade
for these substrates.
The amination of 1-indanone with methylamine c formed the
corresponding a-secondary amine product 27c with modest
conversion values (54%–60%). MaRedAm and AserRedAm

tively, while BacRedAm generated ( S)-27c (71% e.e.) ( Figure 3 ;

BacRedAm-catalyzed reductive amination of 27 with propargyl-
amine a afforded the ( R)-conﬁgured amine product rasagaline
27a (27% conv., 79% e.e.), indicating that the amine nucleophile

also afforded rasagiline ( R)-27a (MaRedAm: 32% conv., 71%

observed with N-methylated product 27c (Figure 3 ). The
RedAm-catalyzed amination with other amine nucleophiles,
namely cyclopropylamine b and allylamine e, yielded the corre-
sponding amine products 27a and 27e in moderate conversions
of up to 65%. These enzymes also catalyzed the reductive
amination of 1-tetralone 28 with methylamine to yield 28c,a
key intermediate of sertraline, albeit in low conversion values

Conclusion
In summary, the functional exploration of
highly divergent, sequence-unrelated
enzyme families based on their C=N
reducing biosynthetic roles has identiﬁed
promiscuous catalysts with IRED activity toward non-native sub-
strates. While accidental enzyme discovery in biosynthetic path-
ways has been the source of many useful catalysts in the past,
here we provide a rationale for IRED mining with high hit rates
(average: /C2446%; successful in 4 of 6 clades) via the substrate
promiscuity of C=N reducing enzymes. Speciﬁcally, we have
mapped and annotated hitherto unexplored sequence space
by uncovering distinct, unrelated enzyme families for prospec-
ting biocatalysts for enantioselective imine reduction and reduc-
tive amination. Clade 3, which comprised PTR1s and alkaloid-
forming plants and bacterial SDRs, represents a unique and
promising functional annotation of sequence space to ﬁnd novel
enzymes for enantioselective imine reduction and reductive ami-
nation with a hit rate >87% for imine-reducing activity for this
clade. We showed that members of PTR1s and NRs were able
to catalyze the reductive amination of simple cyclic ketones
and aromatic aldehydes.

Clade 6 is another promising group to retrieve novel IRED-like
biocatalysts; members of this group such as the mammalian ke-
timine reductase mu-crystallin (CRYM) and iminosuccinate re-
ductases (e.g., PbBhCD) exhibit promiscuous (albeit weak)
imine-reducing activity toward non-native cyclic imines, e.g.,
isoquinoline imine. Importantly, clade 6 also features NatAm-
DHs, which have been shown to catalyze the IRED-like reductive
amination reaction.
7 Our approach allows the identiﬁcation of
alternative sets of evolutionarily unrelated, non-homologous
‘‘isofunctional’’ enzymes.
A comparative evaluation of the performance of these non-ho-
mologous enzyme families in the reductive amination of carbonyl
compounds with primary amines using a small panel of carbonyl
compounds including ketones, aldehydes, a-keto esters, and
a-keto acids highlights differences in substrate speciﬁcity. Clas-
sical IREDs emerged as the most versatile enzyme class, dis-
playing activity across all the investigated substrate groups
and enabling the synthesis of a-secondary amines from difﬁ-
cult-to-aminate aromatic ketones.
Several of the other enzyme classes characterized in this
work act on native substrates that can be considered large
and hydrophobic, providing spacious hydrophobic binding
sites, which should warrant future evaluation of their usefulness
in the reductive amination of bulky substrates. Even more
desirable is an extensive substrate proﬁling study using large
and structurally diverse carbonyl and amine substrate panels
to map out the unique synthetic scope of each of these diverse
enzyme families. Catalytic efﬁciency can further be optimized
through protein engineering to provide a versatile toolbox for
biocatalytic imine reduction and reductive amination of chal-
lenging substrates. In this context, sequence network models
53
and convolutional neural networks using deep learning
models54 can serve as useful tools to investigate the sequence
and structural features peculiar and common to these divergent
enzyme families. Such studies may provide useful mechanistic
insights into enzyme promiscuity to allow (semi)-rational
enzyme engineering of these enzymes.
