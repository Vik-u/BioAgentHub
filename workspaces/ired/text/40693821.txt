ABSTRACT The global rise in syphilis incidence and the challenges of early diagnosis 
highlight the urgent need for convenient diagnostic tools. In this study, we present a 
colorimetric immunosensor for the detection of Treponema pallidum antibodies (TP-Ab) 
using a natural silk cocoon membrane (SCM) as the substrate, based on the principle 
of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The TP monoclonal antibody 3H12 and 
the chimera antigen TP99, comprising epitopes TP15, TP17 , and TP47, were sequen­
tially coupled to functionalized SCM to form the SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor. 
The detection was quantified by color extraction, and the Corrected Ired values were 
used as a judgment parameter. The TP-Ab immunosensor demonstrated a detection 
limit of 0.48 mIU/mL, lower than the 0.68 mIU/mL limit of commercial microplate 
ELISA kits. Furthermore, it exhibited no cross-reactivity with antibodies against other 
pathogens. Testing with a reference serum panel yielded 100% concordance with the 
reference results. Comprehensive statistical analysis of the Corrected Ired values from 
the reference serum panel and banked samples indicated an optimal cutoff value of 
0.0921, achieving 100% sensitivity, 97.96% specificity, and high overall accuracy, with 
an area under the curve of 0.9995 and a 95% confidence interval of 0.9979–1.00. 
Moreover, a statistically significant correlation with microplate ELISA was observed ( r = 
0.9217, P < 0.0001). This reliable ELISA-integrated colorimetric immunosensor, featuring 
a three-dimensional porous structure and inherent bioactiv ity, contributes to improving 
the detection performance and provides a rapid and convenient diagnostic solution for 
syphilis. It is particularly well-suited for resource-limited settings where on-site testing is 
critical.
IMPORTANCE Syphilis remains a major global public health concern, particularly in 
resource-limited settings where early and accurate diagnosis is often hindered by 
technical and economic barriers. Here, we report a novel treponemal antibody (TP-Ab) 
immunosensor based on natural silk cocoon membrane (SCM), a biocompatible and 
porous material with intrinsic bioactivity. By integrating enzyme-linked immunosorb­
ent assay principles and a recombinant TP15-17-47 chimera antigen, the SCM-based 
immunosensor enables colorimetric detection of TP-Ab with high specificity and visual 
readout. Unlike traditional methods that require complex instrumentation or expensive 
reagents, this platform offers a low-cost, portable, and easy-to-use alternative suitable 
for on-site or point-of-care testing. The findings highlight the potential of silk-derived 
biosensors in a promising direction for syphilis screening technologies.

its potential to damage multiple organ systems, including the nervous, cardiovascular, 
digestive, and urinary systems ( 1). In recent years, the global incidence of syphilis 
has been rising steadily, prompting widespread concern as a major public health issue. 
According to the World Health Organization, approximately 5.6 million new cases of 
syphilis are reported annually, with the majority occurring in low- and middle-income 
countries ( 2, 3). Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for controlling syphilis and 
reducing its incidence, but diagnostic challenges persist due to the disease’s complex 
clinical presentation.
While direct diagnostic methods, such as pathogen microscopy and molecular 
biology techniques, can facilitate early detection of syphilis ( 2, 4), their use is constrained 
by limitations in performance, availability, and cost. Consequently, serologic testing 
remains the primary diagnostic approach ( 5, 6). Serological tests for syphilis are broadly 
categorized into non-treponemal and treponemal antibody detection methods, both 
of which are commonly used for screening and confirmation (7, 8). Non-treponemal 
tests, such as the venereal disease research laboratory test, toluidine red unheated 
serum test (TRUST), and rapid plasma reagin test, are effective for large-scale initial 
screenings. However, these tests often lack specificity due to their reliance on non-spe­
cific antigens, including cardiolipin, lecithin, and cholesterol ( 9, 10). Treponemal tests, 
which offer higher specificity and sensitivity, include the Treponema pallidum  particle 
agglutination assay (TPPA), fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorbed (FTA-ABS) test, 
western blot (TP-WB), chemiluminescence analysis (TP-CLIA), enzyme -linked immuno­
sorbent assay (TP-ELISA). While TPPA, FTA-ABS, and TP-WB offer reliable results, their high 
cost, operational complexity, and limited automation impede their routine use in clinical 
practice. Automated methods, such as TP-ELISA and TP-CLIA , provide objective and 
accurate results, making them more suitable for large-scale sample screening. However, 
these methods remain impractical for small-scale testing or emergency use, as they 
require longer processing time ( 11–13). Additionally, their reliance on specialized lab 
facilities, skilled technicians, and costly reagents limits their accessibility in resource-limi­
ted settings, such as rural areas in developing countries. Given this, the development 
of alternative rapid treponemal tests suitable for point-of-care deployment could help 
limit the spread of syphilis by enabling immediate intervention, which presents a critical 
challenge.
Biosensor-based diagnostic assays have emerged as promising alternatives for 
diagnosing STIs, offering greater simplicity and faster results compared to conventional 
methods. Several biosensor platforms have been explored for treponemal antibody 
detection, including electrochemical sensors, surface plasmon resonance immunosen­
sors, lateral flow biosensors employing gold nanoparticles or quantum dots, and vertical 
filtration biosensors utilizing paper membranes ( 14–19). Despite their potential, many 
biosensors depend on specialized substrates, limiting their practical application in 
clinical settings. Recently, silk, a natural polymer, has gained attention as a versatile 
material for biomedical applications due to its excellent biocompatibility, chemical
flexibility, and mechanical robustness ( 20–24). While regenerated silk matrices have 
been used for sensor applications, their preparation involves complex procedures that 
hinder large-scale production. Alternatively, natural silk fibers or membranes can be 
directly used as biosensor substrates, offering a simpler approach without the need for 
regeneration ( 25, 26). In our previous work, we demonstrated that natural silk cocoon 
membrane (SCM), with its free-standing multilayered structure, porosity , and inherent 
bioactivity, serves as an effective immunosensing platform. The SCM-based platform was 
shown to enable rapid red blood cell typing in whole blood with superior analytical 
performance and excellent thermal stability (27, 28).
In this study, we developed a colorimetric immunosensor using SCM as the substrate 
to detect TP-Ab targeting three highly immunogenic antigens: TP15, TP17, and TP47. 
Previous studies have shown that recombinant TP antigens improve the performance of 
treponemal tests, with TP-Ab against TP15, TP17 , and TP47 detectable as early as 2–4 
weeks post-infection, earlier than non-treponemal antibodies ( 29–31). Building on these

findings, we employed a recombinant chimera TP antigen containing epitopes from 
TP15, TP17, and TP47 as the recognition element. The antigen was immobilized onto the 
SCM-based substrate to form a TP-Ab immunosensor, integrated with ELISA principles for 
colorimetric detection. The resulting immunosensor enables accurate, convenient, and 
visual detection of TP-Ab without the need for sophisticated equipment or specialized 
techniques.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Materials and samples
Silk cocoons from Bombyx mori  were sourced from a local market. The chimera of TP 
antigens containing epitopes from TP15, TP17 , and TP47 (referred to as TP99), along 
with horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated TP antigens (HRP-TP mix antigen), and 
the TP47 antigen and HRP-labeled TP47 (HRP-TP47), were purchased from Fapon Biotech 
(China). The 3,3 ′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate was obtained from Sigma-
Aldrich (USA). Standard reference sera—anti-HBV serum (9 mIU/mL), anti-HCV serum (48 
mIU/mL), anti-HIV-1 serum (48 mIU/mL), along with a reference serum panel containing 
40 samples, one positive control (6 mIU/mL), one negative control (matrix liquid, 0 
mIU/mL), and the standard TP-Ab serum at 3, 6, 12 , and 21 mIU/mL concentrations, 
were sourced from Beijing Conchestan Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China. The detailed 
information about the reference serum panel and the standard TP-Ab serum is shown in 
Fig. S1. Treponemal antibody ELISA kits were purchased from Beijing Wantai BioPharm, 
China (Cat. No. WT-5296). Mouse anti-silk cocoon mAbs (MAS-2H3), goat anti-mouse IgG 
(GAM-IgG), and mouse anti-TP mAbs (3H12, specific for TP47 antigen) were developed 
and characterized in-house. A total of 58 banked serum samples , including 30 TP-posi­
tive and 28 TP-negative samples, were examined and confirmed using the TRUST and 
TP-ELISA. These banked samples were kindly provided by the Suzhou Blood Center 
between January 2024 and August 2024.
Fabrication of the SCM-based TP-Ab colorimetric immunosensor
The functionalized SCMs (F-SCMs) were prepared as described in our previous work 
(27, 28). Briefly, silk cocoons (Fig. 1A) were punched into round discs (8 mm 
in diameter, Fig. 1B) using a hole puncher, retaining their natural interconnected 
microporous structure, which was characterized using scanning electron microscopy 
(SEM) (Fig. 1C). Following pretreatment, the SCMs retained their natural bioactivity
and were sequentially coupled with MAS-2H3 and GAM-IgG to form F-SCMs through 
specific directional immunoaffinity binding. The 3H12 mAb was then immobilized 
onto the F-SCMs by binding to GAM-IgG, followed by overnight incubation at 4°C. 
Then, the capture antigen TP99 chimera was immobilized onto the F-SCM/3H12 
complexes to serve as the recognition element, completing the formation of the 
immunosensor membrane (F-SCM/3H12/TP99) (Fig. 1D). After two PBS washes, the 
membranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS at 37°C for 2 h to prevent 
nonspecific binding. Finally, the membranes were washed with PBS and air-dried, 
completing the fabrication of the SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor.
To optimize 3H12 concentration for immobilization, gradients ranging from 0 to 
80 µg/mL (0, 0.2, 1, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 µg/mL) were incubated with F-SCMs overnight at 
4°C, using 200 µL per disc. The binding efficiency of 3H12 was evaluated via colorimetric 
reactions using HRP-conjugated TP47 antigen. Once the optimal concentration of 3H12 
was determined, the ideal concentration of the TP99 was further confirmed. TP99 
concentrations of 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 µg/mL were incubated with F-SCMs/3H12 
complexes overnight at 4°C, using 200 µL per disc. The optimal TP99 concentration was 
identified by testing a standard anti-TP serum series (0, 3, 6, 12, and 21 mIU/mL) with 
HRP-TP mix antigen, and the strongest colorimetric signal was used to confirm the 
optimal concentration.

Detection procedure for the SCM-based TP-Ab colorimetric immunosensor
The SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor was employed in a vertical flow-through ELISA 
format. The SCM discs were placed on top of 2 cm × 2 cm absorbent pads and prewetted 
with 50 µL of PBS. Then, 50 µL of sample was added to each disc and incubated at 37°C 
for 15 min in a water bath. Following this, 100 µL of HRP-TP mix antigen was applied 
and incubated at 37°C for another 15 min. The discs were then rinsed four times with 
PBST (PBS + 0.05% Tween-20) on the absorbent pad. Next, 100 µL of TMB substrate 
was applied to initiate the colorimetric reaction, which proceeded for 5 min at 37°C. 
The reaction was halted by washing the discs with distilled water. Positive results were 
indicated by a blue color on the membrane, while negative results retained the natural 
white color of the SCM. The colorimetric intensity was quantified using ImageJ software. 
The detailed principle of the detection and the result processing are illustrated in Fig. 1E 
and F.
Analytical performance of the SCM-based TP-Ab colorimetric immunosensor
The linear range of detection for the SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor was evaluated by 
testing a series of anti-TP Ab serum concentrations: 0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, and 
21 mIU/mL. The concentrations from 0.125 to 2 were prepared by serial dilution of the 3 
mIU/mL standard anti-TP Ab serum. The limit of detection (LoD) of the TP-Ab immuno­
sensor was calculated by three times the standard deviation of the blank signal divided 
by the slope of the calibration curve at low analyte concentrations ( 32). This approach 
reflects the lowest concentration that can be reliably distinguished from background 
and is widely accepted for evaluating analytical sensitivity. For comparison, a commercial 
microplate-based ELISA was performed as a reference method, and its optical density in 
450 nm (OD450) values was analyzed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
To evaluate the cross-reactivity of the SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor, standard 
reference sera—anti-HBV serum (9 mIU/mL), anti-HCV serum (48 mIU/mL), anti-HIV-1 
serum (48 mIU/mL), anti-TP serum (6 mIU/mL)—and a negative control (matrix liquid, 0

mIU/mL) were tested. This evaluation aimed to verify the specificity of the immunosensor 
and confirm the absence of cross-reactivity with antibodies of common coinfection
diseases.
The reference serum panel of 40 samples, alongside a positive and a negative control, 
was utilized to assess the accuracy of the SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor compared to 
the official outcomes. Meanwhile, the 58 banked samples comprising 30 positives and 
28 negatives were tested by the SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor and the commercial 
microplate-based ELISA. Here, two approaches were used to estimate the cutoff value for 
classifying samples as positive or negative ( 32–34). First, the crude cutoff value used for 
classifying positive versus negative results in the reference serum panel was determined 
according to conventional methodology, defined as the Corrected Ired mean of the 
confirmed 28 negative samples in the banked sample plus three times their standard 
deviation. Then, a ROC curve analysis was performed using MedCalc software (MedCalc 
Software Ltd, Belgium) based on results from a total of 100 samples (40 samples and 
alongside a positive and a negative control of the reference serum panel and 58 banked 
samples). All data were subjected to a comprehensive statistical analysis to further assess 
the accuracy and consistency.
Imaging, color extraction, data curation, and statistical analysis
Color changes on the SCM discs were recorded using a smartphone camera (Apple 
iPhone 15, MTLJ3CH/A). Images were captured in a well-lit environment during the day 
without the use of external lighting or flash. The recorded images were subsequently 
processed for colorimetric quantification, where the surface colors of the SCM discs 
were analyzed to extract red, green , and blue (RGB) values. Histogram analysis of the 
RGB channels was conducted using ImageJ software (NIH) ( Fig. S2 ) ( 35). To minimize 
errors caused by variations in capture conditions or false positives resulting from darker 
imprints at the substrate edges due to liquid evaporation, a uniform selective area 
was defined for image analysis ( 36). The approach effectively excluded dark rings and 
irregular patches, ensuring accurate pixel value representation by averaging intensity 
values across a uniformly distributed area. Corrected RGB intensities (Corrected IRGB) for 
red (Corrected Ired), green (Corrected Igreen), and blue (Corrected I blue) channels were 
calculated using equation 1.

ROC curve analysis was performed to determine the threshold cutoff values for 
distinguishing positive from negative samples more accurately and calculate sensitivity 
and specificity by using the larger sample size. Additionally, the correlation between 
OD450 values from the microplate-based ELISA assay and Corrected Ired values from 
the SCM-based colorimetric immunosensor was evaluated using Spearman’s correla­
tion. Data visualization and figure preparation were carried out using GraphPad Prism 
software (GraphPad 10.1.2).
RESULTS
Selection of the optimum color channel
To optimize the performance evaluation of the SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor, we 
employed RGB image analysis to identify the most sensitive primary color channel. In 
digital images, pixel intensity is represented by the red, green, and blue channels. To 
determine which channel exhibited the highest color variability for our immunosensor, 
we independently tested and compared each primary color channel.
As shown in Fig. 2A and B , the Corrected Ired, Corrected Igreen, and Corrected 
Iblue channels were measured across a 3H12 concentration range of 0–80 µg/mL, and 
concentration-dependent data were plotted. Notably, the red channel demonstrated 
the highest color variability, indicating superior signal sensitivity. Consequently, in all

subsequent experiments, Corrected Ired was selected as the primary analytical signal, 
calculated using equation 2. Here, Corrected Ired represents the mean pixel intensity of 
the red channel obtained from the selected area of the SCM-based TP-Ab colorimetric 
immunosensors.

Fabrication of the SCM-based TP-Ab colorimetric immunosensor
Building upon the F-SCMs developed in our previous research ( 28), we constructed 
the SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor based on the already prepared F-SCMs through 
further immunological affinity coupling. First, 3H12 antibodies were immobilized onto 
the prepared F-SCMs, creating F-SCMs/3H12. TP99 antigen was then introduced to 
specifically bind with 3H12, acting as the capture antigen for detecting TP-Ab.
The intensity of the reaction for various concentrations of immobilized 3H12 was 
assessed (0, 0.2, 1, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 µg/mL), and the results showed that the 
reaction intensity peaked at 20 µg/mL, with saturation occurring at concentrations 
above 40 µg/mL ( Fig. 2B ). The optimal concentration of immobilized 3H12 was deter­
mined when the Corrected Ired intensity reached saturation and stabilized. At concentra­
tions below 10 µg/mL, the Corrected Ired displayed a higher value and a better linear 
correction with 3H12 concentration ( Fig. 2C). Therefore, 20 µg/mL was identified as the 
optimal 3H12 immobilization concentration for subsequent experiments.
Subsequently, the TP99 chimeric antigen was coupled to F-SCMs/3H12, creating the 
SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor (F-SCMs/3H12/TP99). Various concentrations of TP99 
(0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 µg/mL) were tested alongside standard TP antibody concentration 
(0, 3, 6, 12, and 21 mIU/mL) to determine the optimal TP99 coupling concentration. The

results showed that at 2.5 µg/mL concentrations of TP99, the immunosensor could not 
effectively detect high antibody levels. However, when the TP99 concentration  was at 
5 µg/mL, the TP-Ab immunosensor displayed optimal performance, efficiently detecting 
antibodies and reaching saturation (Fig. 3A through C). As a result, 5 µg/mL was selected 
as the optimal TP99 concentration for the SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor.
Analytical performance of the SCM-based TP immunosensor
A series of standard TP-Ab serum samples with concentrations of 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 
2, 3, 6, 12, and 21 mIU/mL were tested to evaluate the linear range and the limit of 
detection. The commercially available microplate ELISA kit served as the reference for 
comparison. The results indicated that with increasing anti-TP antibody concentrations, 
the TP-Ab immunosensor exhibited a corresponding increase in signal intensity. Signal 
saturation occurred at a TP-Ab concentration of 12 mIU/mL, which was consistent with 
the microplate ELISA ( Fig. 4A, B, E, and F ). Both methods demonstrated a good linear 
detection range between 0 and 3 mIU/mL, with R-squared ( R2) values of 0.9762 and 
0.9732, respectively ( Fig. 4C and G ). However, within the lower concentration ranges of 
0–1 mIU/mL, the TP-Ab immunosensor showed a significantly better linear relationship 
(R2 = 0.9836) compared to the microplate ELISA ( R2 = 0.9434), which is primarily due 
to the minimal variation in the OD450 signal of the microplate ELISA between 0 and 
1 mIU/mL. In contrast, the TP-Ab immunosensor exhibited more pronounced signal 
changes, with the Corrected Ired values ranging from 0.048 to 0.231, compared to the 
OD450 range of 0.048–0.148 for the microplate ELISA. Specifically, the OD 450 for 0.1 
and 0.25 mIU/mL were 0.043 and 0.044, which were close to 0.041 for the blank (0 
mIU/mL), making it difficult to distinguish positive results at these low concentrations. 
Comparatively, the Corrected I red signals for 0.1 and 0.25 mIU/mL were 0.083 and 0.122, 
respectively, significantly higher than the 0.048 for the blank ( Fig. 4D and H ). This 
indicates that the TP-Ab immunosensor has a clear advantage in detecting low antibody 
concentrations.
Based on these findings, we further analyzed the LoD for both methods using the 
calibration standard curve derived from the 0–3 mIU/mL anti-TP Ab concentrations. 
The LoD for each method was calculated by three standard deviations of the blank (0 
mIU/mL) divided by the slope of the 0–3 mIU/mL calibration curve. The calculated LoDs 
were 0.48 mIU/mL for the SCM -based TP-Ab immunosensor and 0.68 mIU/mL for the 
microplate ELISA. These results demonstrate the superior sensitivity and lower detection 
limit of the SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor, which exhibited significant signal variation 
even at low antibody concentrations.

To identify cross-reactivity, the immunosensor was tested with a standard reference 
serum containing antibodies against TP , HBV, HCV, and HIV-1, and the TP-negative 
control was detected. The optimized SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor assay yielded 
positive results exclusively for the TP standard reference serum, with significantly higher 
Corrected Ired signals compared to other samples ( P < 0.001) as shown in Fig. 5A. Each 
sample was tested in triplicate. These results confirm the absence of cross-reactivity with 
antibodies against non-TP pathogens.
The detection accuracy of the SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor was further assessed 
using a reference serum panel comprising 40 samples. Representative colorimetric 
results for these samples are shown in Fig. 5B . Notably, this TP-Ab immunosensor 
integrates ELISA principles for testing and result visualization, following the commonly 
used methodology for manual calculations to determine the cutoff value in ELISA assays. 
This value is calculated as the mean value of negative samples plus three times the 
standard deviation ( 34). The Corrected Ired signals from 28 negative samples from the 
banked sample and the negative control were analyzed. Based on these data, the 
crude cutoff value was determined to be 0.0944. Samples with Corrected Ired values 
exceeding 0.0944 were classified as positive, while those with values below 0.0944 were 
classified as negative. Statistical analysis of the 40 samples indicated that 19 samples 
had Corrected Ired values below the cutoff value, while the remaining 21 samples had 
values above it. The Corrected Ired values of the positive and negative controls are 
0.391 and 0.044, respectively. Simultaneously, each sample was compared in parallel

with the reference results tested by treponemal antibody detection methods (TP-ELISA). 
The results demonstrated good concordance between the TP-Ab immunosensor and the 
commercial kit. According to the crude cutoff value of 0.0944, sample 2, with a Corrected 
Ired value of 0.096, would have been classified as positive (since 0.096 > 0.0944), making 
the determined results of sample 2 inconsistent with the reference results. Therefore, it 
was necessary to find a more accurate method for calculating the optimal cutoff value. 
The determined results are shown in Table 1.
Comprehensive statistical analysis
To further validate the performance of the developed method, a comprehensive 
statistical analysis was conducted using data from 100 samples, including the 58 banked 
samples (30 positive and 28 negative), the reference serum panel comprising  40 samples 
(20 positive and 20 negative), and one positive and one negative control. Following 
color extraction and data curation, the Corrected Ired values for all 49 negative samples 
ranged from 0.016 to 0.0961, while those for 51 positive samples ranged from 0.0949 to 
0.528 (Fig. 6A). The positive and negative controls exhibited Corrected Ired values of 0.50 
and 0.04, respectively. The ROC analysis was performed as described in “Imaging, color 
extraction, data curation, and statistical analysis” to further assess assay performance. 
The analysis identified two potential cutoff values, 0.0921 and 0.0961, which closely 
aligned with the preliminary calculated crude cutoff value of 0.0944. These thresholds 
corresponded to sensitivities of 100% and 98.04%, and specificities of 97.96% and 100%, 
respectively (Table 2). Based on the Youden index, the cut off of 0.0961 (Youden index 
= 0.9804) was selected as the optimal cutoff value, which achieved 100% specificity, 
and it was superior to the cutoff value of 0.0921 (Youden index = 0.9796) with 97.96% 
specificity. This decision reflects the clinical imperative for high specificity in screening 
assays.
All Corrected Ired values for negative samples, except one, fell below the 0.0921 
threshold, while all positive samples confirmed by TP-Ab immunosensor exhibited 
Corrected Ired values above 0.0921. This threshold successfully differentiated between 
positive and negative controls with sensitivity (98.04%) and maximum specificity (100%). 
Additionally, the ROC curve analysis also demonstrated excellent diagnostic perform­
ance, yielding an AUC of 0.9995, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.9979–1.00

(Fig. 6B ), indicating near-perfect diagnostic accuracy. Finally, the SCM-based TP-Ab 
colorimetric immunosensor was compared with a commercial microplate ELISA kit. A 
statistically significant correlation was observed between the two methods ( r = 0.9217, P 
< 0.0001) (Fig. 6C). Using pre-defined cutoff values of 0.0961 (SCM-based immunosensor) 
and 0.274 (microplate ELISA), both methods achieved 100% agreement in qualitative 
classification across 100 samples. These results confirm the reliability and robustness of 
the SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor for diagnostic applications.
DISCUSSION
Here, we present a novel colorimetric immunosensor based on SCM-integrated ELISA 
for the detection of TP antibodies. As a new type of biomaterial, the white-colored 
cocoons of B. mori, composed of immunogenic silk proteins, provide a natural free-stand­
ing substrate with a three-dimensional, multilayer , and porous structure, without the 
need for any chemical regeneration of the membranes ( 37–39). This superior physical 
structure provides a larger surface area and a greater number of available binding 
sites for the immobilization of protein molecules. The binding interactions on the 
SCMs are driven by immune affinity coupling between antigens and antibodies, which 
enhances the specificity of the coupling and facilitates sensor activation and function­
alization. In contrast to nonspecific physical adsorption and chemical modification on 
polystyrene or other synthetic substrates, this affinity-based binding improved the 
directionality, stability, and sequential interaction between molecular components ( 40, 
41), thereby contributing to the enhanced performance of the TP-Ab immunosensor. As 
a result, the SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor exhibits a pronounced colorimetric signal 
variation even at low antibody concentrations, demonstrating a lower limit of detection 
while maintaining reliable performance at higher concentrations. These characteristics 
underscore the superior sensitivity of the SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor for detecting 
treponemal antibody. The 3H12 antibody, developed in our laboratory against the

TP47 antigen, was immobilized onto the functional SCM, specifically binding to TP47 
antigenic sites. TP99, a chimera antigen containing TP15, TP17, and TP47 epitopes as 
recognition elements, was used as the capture antigen by binding with 3H12 in the 
TP-Ab immunosensor. The inclusion of these TP99 epitopes allowed broader binding to 
TP-Ab, enhancing both specificity and detection accuracy (42).
This TP-Ab immunosensor integrates ELISA principles for testing and result visu­
alization, achieving a notable improvement without the need for specialized instru­
ments. Only after smartphone camera imaging, the color extraction, data curation, 
and statistical analysis provide more accurate results. By comparing the primary color 
channels, the red channel demonstrated the highest color variability, indicating superior 
signal sensitivity, and the Corrected Ired values were selected as the primary analytical 
signal, calculated using equation 2 . In addition to determining the results through 
color extraction analysis, rapid and preliminary judgments can also be made by visually 
observing the colorimetric signal variation with the naked eye: negative samples display 
white color, representing SCM’s intrinsic color, while positive reactions exhibit a strong 
blue contrast. Therefore, the SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor shows potential for use 
in various diagnostic scenarios, from standard clinical laboratories to resource-limited 
settings, particularly for rapid small-scale or point-of-care testing.
The SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor (F-SCMs/3H12/TP99) was fabricated with the 
optimal immobilization concentrations of 3H12 and TP99. This immunosensor demon­
strated a detection limit of 0.48 mIU/mL, significantly surpassing the 0.68 mIU/mL limit 
of commercial microplate ELISA kits, and showed no cross-reactivity with antibodies 
against HBV, HCV, and HIV-1. These antibodies of pathogens were selected for this initial 
specificity study because they are included in the mandatory blood donor screening 
panel in China and have been reported to occasionally cause false-positive results in 
syphilis serological assays, possibly due to atypical antibody responses ( 43). While this 
evaluation provides a foundational assessment of assay specificity, further studies will 
be conducted to assess potential cross-reactivity with antibodies against phylogeneti­
cally or antigenically related microorganisms, including Borrelia and Leptospira species, 
other gram-negative bacteria, and closely related Treponema species. This ROC-derived 
optimal cutoff value of 0.0961 was ultimately used for all subsequent classification of 
clinical samples, prioritizing 98.04% sensitivity and 100% specificity, critical for mini­
mizing false-negative results and reducing the risk of transmission in the context of 
infectious diseases. The immunosensor demonstrated high overall accuracy, with an AUC 
of 0.9995 ± 0.0008 and a 95% CI of 0.9979–1.00. A statistically significant correlation was 
observed between the TP-Ab immunosensor and the microplate ELISA ( r = 0.9217, P < 
0.0001), with 100% agreement. These results confirm the reliability and robustness of the 
SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor for diagnostic applications.

Although the TP-Ab immunosensor demonstrated promising diagnostic performance 
in this preliminary study, one major limitation of this study is the lack of sufficient clinical 
sample data from multiple time points or different stages of syphilis. Future large-scale 
clinical validation involving more samples is necessary to ensure statistical robustness 
and enhance the broader applicability of the product in diverse clinical settings. 
Previous studies have shown that recombinant TP antigens can enhance treponemal test 
performance, with IgG or IgM antibodies against TP15, TP17 , and TP47 detectable 2–4 
weeks after infection, earlier than non-treponemal antibodies ( 12, 44). However, further 
validation is needed to confirm that the chimeric recombinant antigen TP99, containing 
these epitopes, can accurately detect IgG or IgM antibodies specific to syphilis and 
thus demonstrate the broader applicability of the TP-Ab immunosensor. In addition, the 
natural SCMs were manually screened to ensure consistency in small-scale experiments ;
their inherent variability remains a challenge for reproducibility and scalability. Future 
efforts will focus on reproducible matrix fabrication using engineered silk fiber paper, 
as reported in our previous study ( 45), which could be used for the detection of TP 
antibodies.
Conclusions
In summary, we have developed a novel SCM-based immunosensor for the detection 
of TP antibodies, representing the first application of an SCM-derived colorimetric 
immunosensor integrated ELISA. The optimized protocol for detecting TP antibodies 
in human serum has been successfully demonstrated, highlighting the sensor’s potential 
for on-site syphilis diagnosis. Despite its promising performance, further optimization of 
SCM production to enhance reproducibility and scalability and expansion to detect other 
biomarkers are necessary for broader applicability, especially in point-of-care testing 
in low-resource settings. This work paves the way for the development of cost-effec-
tive, SCM-based, smartphone-readable immunosensors using natural substrates. The 
SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor holds substantial potential for early syphilis screening 
and diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited or remote areas, addressing critical gaps in 
accessible healthcare diagnostics.
