Abstract: Enantioselective reduction of hydrazones provides a convergent and versatile route to synthesize hydrazine-
containing motifs that are commonly found in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However, current methods require the
use of precious metals, costly chiral ligands, and/or forcing reaction conditions. Here, we report the development of a
biocatalytic approach for enantioselective hydrazone reduction using engineered imine reductases. Following evaluation
of an in-house panel of>400 IRED sequences, we identiﬁed a single IR361 I127F L179V variant that promotes reduction
of Cbz-protected hydrazones. The introduction of additional two mutations via directed evolution afforded HRED1.1
that is 20-fold more active than the parent template and promotes reduction of a variety of protected hydrazones in high
yields and selectivities (>99% e.e.), including in preparative scale biotransformations. Structural analysis of HRED1.1
provides insights into the origins of its unique hydrazone reductase activity. This study offers a powerful biocatalytic route
to synthesize valuable chiral hydrazine products and further expands the impressive range of transformations accessible
with engineered imine reductases.
Chiral hydrazines are key structural motifs that are found in
many natural products, agrochemicals, and clinically relevant
pharmaceuticals (Scheme1a).[1–5] These N─N bond contain-
ing compounds can be synthesized from chiral precursors
using a variety of methods (Scheme1b), including alkylation
of hydrazines, N─N bond formation using chloramines, and
rearrangement of halogenated ureas.[6–11] Recently, asymmet-

ric hydrogenation of hydrazones has emerged as a valuable
alternative that doesn’t rely on the use of optically enriched
substrates.[12–21] Although powerful, this approach requires
the use of transition metal catalysts involving costly chiral
ligands along with precious and/or toxic metals. Furthermore,
these transformations typically require forcing reaction con-
ditions, including elevated temperatures and high pressures of
hydrogen, which hinders their broader application.
Increasingly, biocatalysis is viewed as an attractive alter-
native to more traditional synthetic methods due to the high
catalytic efﬁciencies and exacting speciﬁcities associated with
enzymes. Furthermore, the development of powerful enzyme
engineering techniques such as directed evolution allows
the properties of biocatalysts to be adapted to meet target
applications, including adaption of substrate preferences,
improvements in kinetic parameters, and enhanced stability
under process conditions.[22–24] Imine reductases (IREDs) are
one such enzyme class that have become widely adopted as
biocatalysts for the preparation of chiral amines.[25–31] These
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent
enzymes catalyze enantioselective reductions of prochiral
imines to a diverse array of amine products, making them
attractive targets for industrial biocatalysis. For example,
engineered IREDs have been developed for the synthesis
of the chiral LSD1 inhibitor GSK2879552[32] and for the
manufacture of the JAK1 inhibitor acrocitinib.[33]
Although hydrazones have been generated using an
artiﬁcially designed enzyme[34] and have been shown to
be substrates for transaminases, [35] reports of enzymatic
hydrazone reduction are scarce. To our knowledge there
are only two reported cases involving (i) the selective
coupling of 3-cyclopentyl-3-oxopropanenitrile with hydrazine
hydrate,[36] and (ii) a preliminary study using the IRED from
Myxococcus stipitatus, although no data on conversion or

enantioselectivity was provided. [37] Given the signiﬁcant
safety concerns associated with the use of hydrazine hydrate
as a reagent for large scale synthesis,[38] together with a
need to identify enzymes capable of reducing C═N bonds
in a broader range of functional groups, there remains
considerable interest in developing more broadly applicable
biocatalytic hydrazone reduction methodologies for applica-
tions in asymmetric synthesis. In addition to improved safety,
the protected hydrazine products are commonly desired as
they facilitate downstream synthetic manipulations. Here,
we report the discovery and engineering of a hydrazone
reductase (HRED) biocatalyst that furnishes a variety of
chiral hydrazine products with high levels of stereocontrol.
We selected biocatalytic reduction of hydrazone 1,
derived from condensation of commercial (benzyloxycar-
bonyl)hydrazine (Cbz-hydrazine) and acetophenone, as an
initial synthetic target (Figure 1a). To identify a suitable
starting template for enzyme engineering, an in-house panel
of >400 IREDs was evaluated for activity toward the target
transformation. Biotransformations were performed using
cell-free extracts along with an established NADPH cofactor
recycling system using glucose dehydrogenase (GDH). Of the
enzymes tested, only one IRED sequence was identiﬁed with
observable activity toward the conversion of1 to 1a, namely,
I127F L179V double mutant of IR361 (henceforth named
HRED1.0) that was recently engineered by our lab for reduc-
tive amination processes involving cyclic secondary amines as
substrates.[39] Notably, neither the wild-type IRED361 nor the
variants with a single mutation, I127F or L179V, displayed any
observable activity under these assay conditions.
To enhance hydrazone reduction activity, HRED1.0 was
subjected to a single round of evolutionary optimization.
We targeted 22 positions within the active site, including
those in close proximity to the NADPH cofactor and in the
putative substrate-binding pocket, which were individually
randomized using NNK degenerate codons. Individual library
variants were arrayed in 96-well plates and evaluated as
clariﬁed cell lysate using a UPLC assay monitoring the
conversion of 1 to 1a. Analysis of >2000 variants led to
the identiﬁcation of four point mutations (M125F, M125W,
H250L, A100T) displaying increased activity. Substitution of
Met125 to either Phe or Trp gave substantial 6-fold and
5-fold increases in reaction conversion, respectively, under
assay conditions used for evolution (Figure1c and TableS1),
with more modest ca. 1.5-fold improvements observed with
the H250L and A100T mutations (FigureS1 and TableS1).
These beneﬁcial mutations were subsequently combined by
DNA shufﬂing, leading to the identiﬁcation of a M125W
H250L double mutant (HRED1.1) that displays a signiﬁcant
20-fold improvement in reaction conversion, and a 19-fold
improvement in reaction rate, over the parent HRED1.0
template (Figures1b,c and S2;T a b l eS1).
Using HRED1.1 as a biocatalyst, complete conversion of
1 (5 mM) to1a can be achieved within 18 h (Figure2 and
Table S1). For comparison, under identical assay conditions,
only 5% conversion is observed with HRED1.0. Further-
more, HRED1.1 displays exceptional levels of stereocontrol,
affording (R)-enantiomer of 1a in >99% e.e.( F i g u r e1d).
The synthetic utility of HRED1.1 was demonstrated in a
preparative scale biotransformation to yield 123 mg of (R)-1a
(98% conversion, 92% isolated yield) (TableS1). Optimiza-
tion of reaction conditions (FiguresS3–S9) afforded a 10-fold
reduction in NADP+ and GDH-901 concentrations compared
to those used during evolution without signiﬁcant reduction
in conversion. The high yields achieved by HRED1.1 are
particularly notable given that the biotransformations are
heterogeneous due to the low solubility of both hydrazone
1 and hydrazine 1a. Beyond reduction of preformed hydra-
zones, HRED1.1 can also achieve reductive coupling of
acetophenone and Cbz-hydrazine with modest conversions
and exceptional stereocontrol (Figure2).
To further explore its synthetic utility, HRED1.1 was
evaluated for activity toward a range of protected hydrazones
1–11 (Figure 2 and Table S2). In all cases, HRED1.1
achieves exceptional levels of stereocontrol ( >99% e.e.).
Derivatives of 1 containing ortho-, meta-, or para-ﬂuoro
substituents (2–4) are all well tolerated, albeit with reduced

conversions for the para-derivative 4. Analogues 5 and 6
containing pharmaceutically relevant pyridyl motifs are also
substrates for HRED1.1.[42,43] Substrates containing larger
aryl-substituents are not accommodated by HRED1.1 due to
steric constraints within the active site pocket (FigureS10).
Notably, the scope of HRED1.1 is not limited to aromatic
hydrazones; substrates 7 and 8, derived from the aliphatic
ketones pentanone andtert-butyl methyl ketone, respectively,
were efﬁciently converted in high yields. Finally, we explored
the activity of HRED1.1 with a selection of substrates derived
from commercial hydrazine reagents featuring orthogonal
benzoyl (9–10)a n dB o c(11) protecting groups. Importantly,
these modiﬁcations are also well tolerated by HRED1.1,
thus further expanding the synthetic utility of our hydrazone
reductase biocatalyst.
The improved ability of HRED1.1 to accept the hydrazone
1 was investigated using X-ray crystallography and modeling.
The structure was determined to a resolution of 2.77 Å,
with two molecules, A and B, in the asymmetric unit
comprising one dimer. The structure was very similar overall
to that of wild-type IR361 (PDB 7OSN),[40] displaying the
canonical IRED fold, in which an N-terminal Rossman fold
domain is attached to a C-terminal helical bundle through
a long interdomain helix. Two active sites are formed at
the interfaces of the N-terminal domain of one monomer
and the C-terminal bundle of the other through reciprocal
domain sharing. The crystals contained a large proportion of
water (71%) and the modest resolution was accompanied by
poor electron density in the N-terminal domain of monomer
B, leading to some zero-occupancy residues and many side-
chains not being modeled in that region. However, the
density within monomer A and the C-terminal bundle of
B was good, permitting the building of side chains and
NADP+ molecule within the active site at the interface of the
domains. Omit density for the more structurally consequential
mutations (M125W and I127F) was also clear (FigureS11).
Superimposition of the HRED1.1 structure with that of
wild-type IR361 revealed the consequences of the mutations
(Figure 3a). The substitution of I for F in position 127 at
the bottom of the active site as presented in Figure3a has,
counterintuitively, made more space in the active site through
the displacement of the side chain of (B)Y221. Mutation of
M125 to W at the top of the active site has again created
more space, despite being a larger residue as it projects
upward and makes a new stabilizing interaction with the
side chain of D176 through the N-atom on the indole ring.
Further stabilization of this conformation may be provided
by a stacking interaction between the indole and the mutated
179 position from L to V, which lies on the interdomain
helix on the other side of the active site cavity. (B)H250L
is situated at the interface between the N-terminal domain
of one monomer and the C-terminal bundle of its neighbor
and may provide stabilizing hydrophobic interactions in a
mode that has been observed for other IREDs in engineering
studies.[29,32,33,44]
The structure of HRED1.1 was modeled with the sub-
strate 1 (Figure 3b) using Autodock VINA.[45] One of the

In summary, we have established a biocatalytic platform
for selective reduction of hydrazones to afford valuable
chiral hydrazine motifs that are common precursors for
pharmaceutical and agrochemical synthesis. Our analysis of
>400 IRED sequences suggests that hydrazone reduction is a
rare activity within the imine reductase family. Nevertheless,
introduction of only a handful of mutations into IR361 has led
to the development of an engineered HRED biocatalyst that
achieves exceptional selectivities across a range of hydrazone
substrates, with high reaction yields also achievable with
elevated enzyme loadings (2 mol%). Moving forward, more
extensive engineering will undoubtedly deliver more potent
HRED biocatalysts, including those that are tailored toward
speciﬁc target products and/or adapted to operate under
viable process conditions. In contrast to existing methods
of hydrazone reduction, our biocatalytic approach is not
reliant on precious/toxic metals, costly ligands, or forcing
reaction conditions, and therefore offers a more sustainable
strategy for synthesizing valuable chiral N ─N containing
products.
