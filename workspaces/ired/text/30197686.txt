Sequence-Based In-silico Discovery, Characterisation, and
Biocatalytic Application of a Set of Imine Reductases

Imine reductases (IREDs) have recently become a primary focus
of research in biocatalysis, complementing other classes of
amine-forming enzymes such as transaminases and amine
dehydrogenases. Following in the footsteps of other research
groups, we have established a set of IRED biocatalysts by
sequence-based in silico enzyme discovery. In this study, we
present basic characterisation data for these novel IREDs and
explore their activity and stereoselectivity using a panel of
structurally diverse cyclic imines as substrates. Specific activities
of >1 U/mg and excellent stereoselectivities ( ee >99 %) were
observed in many cases, and the enzymes proved surprisingly
tolerant towards elevated substrate loadings. Co-expression of
the IREDs with an alcohol dehydrogenase for cofactor regener-
ation led to whole-cell biocatalysts capable of efficiently
reducing imines at 100 mM initial concentration with no need
for the addition of extracellular nicotinamide cofactor. Prepara-
tive biotransformations on gram scale using these ‘designer
cells’ afforded chiral amines in good yield and excellent optical
purity.
Introduction
Chiral amines form the core structure of numerous natural
products and are also present in many synthetic bioactive
molecules. According to recent estimates, approximately 40 %
of active pharmaceutical ingredients and 20 % of agrochemicals
contain a chiral amine moiety.
[1] The paramount importance of
this class of substances has led to the development of
numerous strategies for their asymmetric synthesis, [1b,2] of which
biocatalytic methods have attracted increased interest in recent
years.
[1a,3] The established approaches in this context, such as
the kinetic resolution of racemic amines using lipases, [4] the
asymmetric reductive amination of prochiral ketones using
transaminases,[5] and the chemo-enzymatic deracemisation of
amines employing amine oxidases in combination with chem-
ical reducing agents, [1a,6] have recently been supplemented by
biocatalytic imine reduction as a novel, intensively investigated
strategy for chiral amine synthesis.
[7] In particular, the discovery
in 2010 of natural imine reductases (IREDs) [8] – an enzyme class
capable of reducing cyclic imines at the expense of a
nicotinamide cofactor – has sparked immense research efforts
directed at identifying and characterising a larger number of
these novel enzymes, and applying them in organic synthesis.
Over the last seven years, a large number of imine
reductases have been identified and heterologously expressed,
and their substrate scope, their kinetic properties, their three-
dimensional structure and their applicability in preparative-
scale reactions have been investigated. [8–9] Both ( R)- and ( S)-
selective IREDs are relatively common in bacteria (particularly in
actinomycetes) and all known members of this enzyme family
share the same overall structure: a dimer formed through
reciprocal domain swapping between two monomers that
consist of an N-terminal, cofactor-binding Rossmann fold motif
and a helical C-terminal domain. The preferred cofactor is
generally NADPH, but it has been shown that structure-guided
protein engineering can be used to increase the specific activity
of IREDs towards the non-phosphorylated nicotinamide cofac-
tor (NADH).
[9a,n] Moreover, it has been found that IREDs are not
limited to reducing cyclic imines but that they are also capable
of coupling carbonyl compounds and amines in a reductive
amination reaction, albeit at often drastically reduced
rates.[9b,g–j,s,w,z] While most IREDs seem to rely on spontaneous
imine formation from the amine and carbonyl substrates when
performing such reductive aminations, a sub-class of the IRED
family, termed ‘reductive aminases’, has been found capable of
catalysing the imine formation step as well.
[9c,10] Biocatalytic
cascade systems in which IREDs are combined with other
enzymes to achieve deracemisation of cyclic amines [9o] or their
asymmetric synthesis from open-chain precursors [9e,m] have also
been developed. However, reports on the preparative applica-
tion of IRED-catalysed reductions have remained comparably
scarce.
The first two members of the IRED family (included for
comparison in the present study as IRED- A and IRED- I,s e e

Table 1) have been discovered by Mitsukura and co-workers in
an extensive screening of microbial strain collections. [8] The
cloning and sequencing of the genes encoding these proteins
has paved the way for subsequent enzyme discovery efforts
focused on identifying homologues of the original IREDs in
public databases using a sequence-based bioinformatics ap-
proach. A result of these efforts is the establishment of the Imine
Reductase Engineering Database(https://ired.biocatnet.de/), main-
tained by researchers from the University of Stuttgart,
[9aa,11] which
currently (version 3, accessed 15 March 2018) contains more
than 1400 sequences of putative IREDs. The wealth of sequence
information in this database has been used as the basis for
detailed bioinformatics analyses,
[11] but only a small fraction of
the listed enzymes has actually been studied at the protein level.
Herein, we report the sequence-based in-silico discovery
and characterisation of eight novel imine reductases along with
the investigation of six known IREDs, all of which are also
contained in the Imine Reductase Engineering Database. More-
over, we report on the application of these enzymes in the
asymmetric reduction of cyclic imines, employing an alcohol
dehydrogenase as auxiliary enzyme and isopropanol as co-
substrate for cofactor regeneration. Finally, we demonstrate
that by employing an E. colistrain that co-expresses the alcohol
dehydrogenase and a suitable IRED, preparative-scale reduc-
tions of imines at elevated substrate concentration are possible
without the need for addition of NADP
+.
Results and Discussion
Sequence-based In-silico Enzyme Discovery
When we started our investigations in late 2013, the Imine
Reductase Engineering Database had not yet been established.
We therefore followed our own sequence-based approach for
the in-silico discovery of putative IREDs, which we based on
overall protein sequence homology to the four confirmed IREDs
known at that time (IREDs A, B, I and K; see Table 1) and on the
presence of specific active-site key residues. The first X-ray
crystal structure of an IRED (Q1EQE0, IRED- B; PDB 3zgy, 3zhb)
had just been solved and published by Grogan and co-workers
a few months earlier, and their results suggested that an
aspartic acid residue, D187 (IRED- B numbering), was crucial for
the imine reductase activity of the protein, supposedly playing
a role in substrate protonation.
[9ad] A tyrosine residue, Y169
(IRED-I numbering), is present in the corresponding position of
the ( S)-selective IREDs I and K and can be assumed to serve the
same function as D187 in the ( R)-selective Q1EQE0 enzyme. On
the basis of this limited structural and functional information
we decided to search the UniProt database for protein
sequences that ( i) scored an E-value of /C20 10/C0 50 in a protein
BLAST search using the sequences of IREDs A, B, I,o r K as
template, ( ii) contained a full-length Rossmann-fold domain
with a complete GxGxxG consensus sequence, hence excluding
truncated sequences, and ( iii) featured an acidic residue (Asp,
Glu or Tyr) in position 187 (IRED- B numbering). Since Grogan
and co-workers suggested that the flanking of D187 in Q1EQE0
by two apolar residues (L137 and L191) might be instrumental
in raising the p K
a value of the D187 side chain, resulting in it
being protonated under physiological conditions, we also made
the presence of such apolar flanking residues a selection
requirement when the ‘proton donor’ residue was Asp or Glu.
The 215 hits identified using these search criteria were
narrowed down to 182 by removal of duplicates (identical
database entries found by more than one of the four BLAST
searches) and of redundant sequences (database entries having
a different accession code but identical sequence). These 182
candidates were aligned using the Clustal Omega online tool
and arranged into a phylogenetic tree by the neighbour-joining
method.
The phylogenetic tree (Figure 1) shows a clear separation
into two major branches: the ‘D-type’ branch with a higher
overall homology to confirmed IREDs A and B, featuring an
aspartic acid (or, in two cases a glutamic acid) residue in
position 187 (IRED- B numbering), and the ‘Y-type’ branch with a
higher overall homology to IREDs I and J and a tyrosine residue
in the respective position. The D-type branch is the larger one
of the two, accommodating 116 of the 182 candidate

sequences identified (64 %). Scheller et al. have observed a
similar division into two superfamilies of different size in a
sequence similarity network analysis of the first version of the
Imine Reductase Engineering Database.[9aa] Figure 1 also shows
that the sequence space of both major branches of our
phylogenetic tree has been explored only in small parts and
with an unbalanced distribution of the characterised enzymes.
We randomly selected 15 novel enzyme candidates [12] from
all main sub-branches of the phylogenetic tree for expression
and experimental characterisation, along with the four known
IREDs A, B, I, and K. The genes encoding these 19 proteins were
ordered as linear, synthetic DNA double-strands, subcloned into
pET28a(+) and expressed heterologously in E. coli BL21 (DE3),
using terrific broth (TB) as growth medium and IPTG (1 mM) for
induction. Under these conditions, four enzymes (B5GWP9,
F6EHI0, I0KVG9, I0W7U4) were expressed only in insoluble form,
while for the gene encoding G4HA73 several attempts of
subcloning failed and an expression construct was hence never
obtained. These five candidates were therefore excluded from
all further investigations. The 14 enzymes expressed in soluble
form (listed in Table 1) were tested for IRED activity using wet
whole cells as biocatalyst and 2-methylpyrroline ( 1a , 50 mM;
Figure 2) as substrate. These experiments confirmed that all ten
novel IRED candidates are indeed functional imine reductases.
Conservation analyses of the Imine Reductase Engineering
Database have revealed the conservation of Asp187 (IRED- B
numbering) in IREDs that reduce 1a to the ( R)-amine, and of a
tyrosine residue in the corresponding position of the ( S)-
selective enzymes,
[9aa] suggesting that the residue in this
position might be used as a predictor of IRED stereoselectivity.
More recent studies have shown, however, that functional
IREDs of either selectivity can feature other amino acid residues,
including those with non-acidic side-chains, in the ‘proton
donor’ position,
[9l,s,x,y] which demonstrates that the factors
governing IRED selectivity are more complex than initially
assumed. Chiral-phase GC analysis of the biotransformations of
substrate 1a by the 14 IREDs investigated in this study showed
that with one exception all enzymes exhibit the expected
stereoselectivity ( R for D-type, S for Y-type). Only IRED- G
(L8EIW6) breaks this pattern: it is a D-type IRED but forms ( S)-2-
methylpyrrolidine from 1a in >99 % ee. The same ‘inverse’
stereoselectivity is also observed with several other substrates
(see Figure 3 below). This finding is interesting in the context of
a recent analysis by Fademrecht et al., who found that two
active-site residues consistently differ between ( R)- and ( S)-
selective IREDs: Previously described ( S)-selective enzymes
invariably have a proline in position 139 and a phenylalanine in
position 194 (IRED- B numbering for both positions), while ( R)-
selective IREDs feature a hydrophobic residue (Val, Thr, Ile) in
Figure 1.Phylogenetic tree of the putative imine reductases identified in this work. Enzymes reported in the literature before the start of our investigation s
are shown as coloured dots with coloured labels. Enzymes identified and characterised by other research groups during the course of our studies are sh own

codes are the UniProt identifiers of the respective protein sequences. The scale bar represents 0.1 variations per amino acid residue.

position 139 and methionine or leucine in position 194. [11] The
partial sequence alignment in Table 1 shows that IRED- G
contains the proline and phenylalanine residues typical for ( S)-
IREDs, indicating that these are better predictors for IRED
stereoselectivity than overall sequence homology or the nature
of the ‘proton donor’ residue.
Enzyme Characterisation
After confirming the imine reductase activity of the novel IREDs
and determining their stereoselectivity in the reduction of 1a ,
we proceeded with a thorough characterisation of the enzymes
with respect to their pH-activity profile, their temperature
stability, their cofactor preference, and their activity and stereo-
selectivity towards a broader range of substrates. The known
IREDs A, B, I, and K were included in these experiments for
comparison.
Analysis of the pH-activity profiles revealed two groups of
enzymes, one showing highest activity at pH 7.0–7.5 (IREDs A–
E, I–M), the other preferring slightly acidic pH values (pH 6.0;
IREDs F–H, N). The temperature stability varied widely: Some
enzymes (e. g., IREDs A, M) retained significant activity even
after incubation at 50 8C for 1 h, while others (e. g., IRED- B) were
completely inactivated even by a 1 h incubation at 37 8C. The
preferred cofactor for all investigated enzymes is NADPH, but
NADH was also accepted by some of the enzymes at
appreciable rates. For instance, IRED- H showed 25 % of its
maximum activity when NADH was used as cofactor instead of
NADPH. Detailed data on pH optimum, thermostability, and
cofactor preference are provided in the Supporting Information
(Supporting Figures S1–S5).
The specific activities of the IREDs towards substrates 1a –g
were determined by spectrophotometrically following the
consumption of NADPH in biotransformations using enzymes
purified by Ni
2+-NTA affinity chromatography. Table 2 summa-
rises the obtained results. Although activity was detectable for
all but two substrate–enzyme combinations, the observed
values vary over a wide range: The specific activities of different
IREDs towards the same substrate span up to three orders of
magnitude (e. g., substrate 1d ) and the activity of the same
enzyme towards the seven imines tested can range from as low
as 1.4 mU/mg to >2700 mU/mg (IRED- F, substrates 1a and 1e).
3,4-Dihydroisoquinoline ( 1e) turned out to be a particularly
well-accepted substrate, being reduced at initial rates of
>500 mU/mg by 10 out of the 14 IREDs.
To obtain information on the stereoselectivity of the
investigated IREDs and on their activity towards substrates 1h –
k, which are not amenable to photometric activity screening,
we next performed biotransformations of all ten imines 1a –k
(10 mM) employing lyophilised crude cell-free extracts of IREDs
A–N. For in situ regeneration of the NADPH cofactor, we chose
the well-known alcohol dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus
brevis (Lb-ADH), employing isopropanol (5 % v/v) as cheap and
innocuous sacrificial co-substrate. This approach, which repre-
sents a biocatalytic alcohol-to-imine hydrogen transfer, is
enabled by the excellent chemoselectivity of the involved
enzymes: Alcohol dehydrogenases are unable to reduce imines,
while imine reductases are generally unreactive towards
carbonyl compounds.
[13] As shown in Figure 3, high conversions
and excellent optical purities were attained in many of the
reactions and the observed stereoselectivities largely follow the
expected patterns, with the previously discussed exception of
the ( S)-selective D-type IRED- G. Among the general trends that
emerge from the data are the poor acceptance of sterically

demanding imines 1h , 1j and 1k by D-type IREDs and the
unpredictable and in many cases moderate stereoselectivities
observed with substrates 1d and 1i.
Process Optimisation
Many of the biotransformations reported in Figure 3 reached
completion already within 2 h (Supplementary Tables S1–S4,
Supporting Information), which prompted us to challenge the
enzymes with substantially higher substrate concentrations
while keeping all other reaction conditions unaltered. [14] Gratify-
ingly, many of the reactions conducted at elevated substrate
loading proceeded smoothly to high conversions, whereby the
highest productivities were often observed at 100–200 mM
concentration of the imine (for an exemplary data set, see
Figure 4; for complete data, see Supplementary Figures S6–S9
in the Supporting Information). These results are not surprising
in the light of previous Michaelis /C0 Menten kinetic studies on
IREDs, which found KM values of typical imine substrates to be
in the millimolar range. [9t,v,ab–ad,ah] These enzymes therefore reach
maximum activity only in the presence of high-millimolar
concentrations of imines. In some cases, however, elevated
substrate concentrations were not well tolerated. For instance,
the conversion of indoleine 1i by IREDs C, G, and I dropped
from >90 % to below 5 % upon raising the substrate concen-
tration from 10 mM to 50 mM (Figure 4, B; Supplementary
Figure S9 in the Supporting Information).
Out of the biotransformations that worked well at 100 mM
substrate concentration, two were chosen for reactions at
preparative scale (5 mmol): Imine 1b was reduced by IRED- J to
(S)-2-methylpiperidine ( 2b), which was isolated as the corre-
sponding acetamide derivative in 74 % yield and >99 % ee. The
reduction of 1-methyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline ( 1g ) by IRED- D
afforded ( R)-2g in 98 % ee and 91 % isolated yield.
Co-expression of IREDs andLb-ADH
Although the biotransformations using lyophilised cell-free
extracts of IREDs and Lb-ADH gave excellent results, we
anticipated that a whole-cell biocatalyst would be even better
applicable to preparative-scale reactions. In particular, co-
expression of IREDs and Lb-ADH in a single host would provide
a convenient ‘all-in-one’ biocatalyst that could benefit from
intracellular cofactor cycling, rendering the external addition of
NADP
+ unnecessary. Because the plasmids used for expression
of the imine reductases and of Lb-ADH are complementary with
respect to both antibiotic resistance and induction conditions,
implementation of a two-plasmid co-expression system was
straightforward (Figure 5).
The ‘designer cells’ co-expressing Lb-ADH and IREDs worked
well in the absence of additional NADP +, even after prolonged
storage of the lyophilised preparations at 4 8C (data not shown).
Biotransformations carried out with 20 mg/mL of lyophilised
cells gave results comparable to those obtained with 2 mg/mL
of lyophilised cell-free extract, and elevated substrate concen-
trations were also tolerated similarly well (see Figure 6 for three
examples; for complete data see Supplementary Figures S10–
Figure 4.Conversions (bars) and productivities (circles) achieved in the
reduction of (A) imine 1g using IRED- J, and (B) imine 1i using IRED- C. Note
the different scaling of the substrate concentration and productivity axes in
(A) and (B). Reaction conditions:Substrate 1g or 1i (10–500 mM), NADP

(1 mM), IRED- J or IRED- C (2 mg/mL crude preparation), Lb-ADH (2 mg/mL
crude preparation), Tris-HCl buffer (100 mM, pH 7.5), 2-PrOH (5 % v/v), 30 8C,
24 h.

S16 in the Supporting Information). No significant differences
were observed in the enantioselectivities of the reductions
catalysed by the ‘designer cells’ compared to those catalysed
by the cell-free enzyme preparations.
The preparative applicability of the IRED/ Lb-ADH ‘designer
cells’ was demonstrated by two reductions at gram scale
(10 mmol substrate at 100 mM concentration): The biotransfor-
mation of imine 1c by cells co-expressing Lb-ADH and IRED- D
afforded, after in situ derivatisation with acetic anhydride, the
acetamide derivative of amine ( R)-2c in 65 % isolated yield
(1.01 g) and >99 % ee. Using an Lb-ADH/IRED-J ‘designer cell’,
(S)-1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline ( 2g ) was obtained
from the corresponding imine 1g in 94 % yield (1.38 g) and in
optically pure form ( ee >99 %).
Conclusions
To summarise, we report the expression and characterisation of
eight novel imine reductases along with six literature-known
enzymes, thereby contributing to the further expansion of the
growing IRED enzyme ‘toolbox’. Basic characterisation of the
new enzymes revealed two distinct groups with respect to the
pH optimum and wide variations in temperature stability. The
specific activities of the IREDs towards the investigated imines
1a –g ranged from <1 mU/mg to >5 U/mg. In terms of
substrate scope, group-specific trends were observed for the
‘D-type’ and ‘Y-type’ branches of the phylogenetic tree, as the
D-type enzymes gave particularly poor results with sterically
demanding imines. The stereoselectivity of the enzymes, on the
other hand, was most reliably predicted not by their affiliation
to either of the two phylogenetic branches but rather by the
presence of key residues identified in a recent bioinformatics
analysis by Pleiss and co-workers.
[11]
Cofactor regeneration via formal alcohol-to-imine hydrogen
transfer employing alcohol dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus
brevis as auxiliary enzyme was successfully implemented and
allowed the imine reductions to proceed efficiently at elevated
substrate concentrations (100 mM) and on preparative scale. A
further simplification of the reaction system was achieved by
using an IRED/ADH ‘designer cell’ as biocatalyst, which showed
satisfactory imine-reducing activity also in the absence of
additional NADP +. Studies aimed at applying the IREDs
described herein to the preparation of more complex amines
are currently underway in our laboratory, and their results will
be reported in due course.

dipping into basic permanganate reagent (10 g/L KMnO 4, 50 g/L
Na2CO3, 0.85 g/L NaOH, in H 2O), or by UV. Unit resolution GC-MS
analyses were performed using electron impact (EI) ionisation at

70 eV and quadrupole mass selection. Optical rotation values [ a]D

were measured at 589 nm (Na D-line) and 20 8C using a cuvette of
1 dm path length.
Unless otherwise noted, reagents and organic solvents were
obtained from commercial suppliers in reagent grade quality and
used without further purification. Diethyl ether and acetonitrile
used for anhydrous reactions were dried over molecular sieves
(3 A˚) for at least 48 hours. THF used for anhydrous reactions was
distilled from potassium/benzophenone directly before use. For
anhydrous reactions, flasks were oven-dried and flushed with dry
argon just before use. Standard syringe techniques were applied to
transfer dry solvents and reagents in an inert atmosphere of dry
argon.
Imines 1a , 1e , 1g , 1h, 1i , and 1k as well as amines 2a, 2b , and 2e
were obtained from commercial suppliers and used as received.
Synthetic procedures and full characterisation data for all other
substrates and products are provided in the Supporting Informa-
tion.
Alcohol dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus brevis and the imine
reductases used in this study were heterologously expressed in E.
coli as described in the Supporting Information.
The analytical methods used for determination of conversion and
enantiomeric excess are described in the Supporting Information.
In-silico Enzyme Discovery
The full-length protein sequences of IREDs A, B, I, and K (UniProt
accession codes M4ZRJ3, Q1EQE0, M4ZS15, D2AWI4) were used as
templates for protein BLAST searches
[15] in the UniProtKB database
(http://www.uniprot.org/blast/) and the generated hit sets were
limited to homologues with E-values of /C20 10/C0 50, giving a total of
1065 candidate sequences (274 from IRED- A, 319 from IRED- B, 245
from IRED- I, 227 from IRED- K). These sequences were manually
checked for the presence of the following features: (1) a full-length
Rossmann-fold domain with a complete GxGxxG consensus
sequence, (2) a polar residue (Ser, Thr) in position 111 (IRED- B
numbering), (3) an acidic residue (Asp, Glu) in position 187 (IRED- B
numbering), along with apolar residues (Ala, Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, Val)
in positions 137 and 191 (IRED- B numbering), or a Tyr residue in
position 187 (IRED- B numbering). Of the 1065 candidate sequences,
215 contained all three features. These were further narrowed
down to 182 by removal of duplicates (identical database entries
found by more than one of the four BLAST searches) and of
redundant sequences (database entries having a different accession
code but identical sequence). A multiple-sequence alignment of
the 182 candidate proteins was generated using the Clustal Omega
online tool (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/)
[16] and ar-
ranged into a phylogenetic tree by the neighbour-joining method,
also using the Clustal Omega interface. The tree was visualised
using the TreeView 1.6.6 application, exported in enhanced
metafile (EMF) format, and coloured and labelled using Adobe
Illustrator CS5.
Photometric Determination of Enzyme Activity
Determination of pH/C0 activity profiles: A stock solution of NADPH
(20 mM; final concentration in the reaction mixture: 0.2 mM) was
prepared in potassium phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 7.0), and a
stock solution of the assay substrate (IREDs A, C, D, G, J, and K: 1a ,
IREDs B, H, and L: 1b , IREDs E, F, I, and N: 1e , IRED- M: 1g ; 200 mM;
final concentration in the reaction mixture: 10 mM) was prepared in
2-propanol. For each photometric assay reaction, the NADPH stock
(10 mL) was mixed with enzyme solution (10 mL; protein concen-
tration: 1.3–27.3 mg/mL; final concentration in the reaction mixture:
0.013–0.273 mg/mL), the appropriate buffer solution (930 mL;
citrate/C0 phosphate, 100 mM, pH 5.0–6.0; potassium phosphate,
100 mM, pH 6.0–8.0; Tris /C0 HCl, 100 mM, pH 8.0–9.0; glycine /C0 NaOH,
100 mM, pH 9.0–11.0), and the imine stock solution (50 mL) in a
cuvette of 1 cm path length. In addition, negative control reactions
lacking enzyme were set up. All reactions, including the negative
controls, were performed in triplicate. The assay reactions were
followed by measuring the absorbance at 370 nm every 2 s over a
period of 5 min using a Thermo Scientific GeneSys 10 spectropho-
tometer. Slopes were determined by applying a linear fit to the
linear range of the absorbance curve using the built-in function of
the photometer’s Thermo Scientific VISIONlite 5 software. Slopes
were corrected for spontaneous absorbance decrease (rate ob-
tained from the negative control reactions) and the specific IRED
activity was calculated using formula (1) given below.

where A [U · mg/C0 1] … IRED activity; DOD [min/C0 1] … slope of

of NADPH (2.216 at 370 nm); l [cm] … path length of sample (1.0 in
this case); cP [mg · mL/C0 1] … concentration of enzyme in the reaction
mixture
Determination of thermostability: The activity assays were carried
out as described above for the determination of the pH–activity
profiles, using potassium phosphate buffer (20 mM, pH 7.0) for all
measurements. The undiluted enzyme solutions were incubated
before the activity measurements at the appropriate temperature
(25 8C, 30 8C, 37 8C, 40 8C, or 50 8C) on a benchtop thermoshaker for
1h .
Determination of specific activities: Stock solutions of NADPH
(10 mM; final concentration in the reaction mixture: 2 mM) and of
the enzyme (0.0467–4.67 mg/mL; final concentration in the reaction
mixture: 0.035–3.5 mM) were prepared in the appropriate buffer
(IREDs A–E, I–M: Tris-HCl, 100 mM, pH 7.5; IREDs F–H, N: potassium
phosphate, 100 mM, pH 6.0). Stock solutions of the assay substrates
(1a –1g, 200 mM; final concentration in the reaction mixture:
10 mM) were prepared in 2-propanol. For each photometric assay
reaction, the NADPH stock (20 mL) was mixed with substrate stock
(5 mL) and enzyme stock solution (75 mL) in a 96-well microtitre
plate. In addition, negative control reactions (lacking either
substrate or enzyme) were set up. All reactions, including the
negative controls, were performed in triplicate. The assay reactions
were followed by measuring the absorbance at 370 nm every 20 s
over a period of 1 h using a Molecular DevicesSpectraMax M2 plate
reader. If needed, the enzyme concentration was adjusted so as to
obtain at least 20 data points in the linear range of absorbance
decrease. Slopes were determined by applying a linear fit to the
linear range of the absorbance curve using the built-in function of
the plate reader’s Molecular Devices Softmax Pro v6.4 software.
Slopes were corrected for spontaneous absorbance decrease (rate
obtained from the negative control reactions) and the specific IRED
activity was calculated using formula (1), whereby the path length
for each well was determined using the PathCheck feature of the
Softmax Pro software ( via a cuvette reference containing only
buffer and 2-propanol).
Biotransformations
Screening of IRED activity and stereoselectivity: A stock solution of
substrate 1a –k (200 mM; final concentration in reaction mixture:
10 mM) was prepared in 2-propanol, and a stock solution of Lb-
ADH (2.11 mg/mL; final concentration in reaction mixture: 2.0 mg/

mL) and NADP + (1.05 mM; final concentration in reaction mixture:
1.0 mM) was prepared in the appropriate buffer (IREDs A–E, I–-M:
Tris-HCl, 100 mM, pH 7.5; IREDs F–H, N: potassium phosphate,
100 mM, pH 6.0). The lyophilised IRED cell-free extract (1.0 mg) was
weighed into a microcentrifuge tube (2 mL) and the ADH/NADP
+
stock (475 mL) as well as the substrate stock (25 mL) were added.
The samples were incubated at 30 8C and 120 rpm in a shaking
incubator for the appropriate time (2 h, 24 h). The biotransforma-
tions were then quenched by addition of sat. aq. Na
2CO3 solution
(200 mL) and the resulting solutions were extracted with ethyl
acetate (2 /C148 500mL; containing 10 mM n-dodecane as internal
standard). The combined extracts were dried over MgSO 4, centri-
fuged (13,000 rpm, 1 min), and the supernatant was transferred to
a glass vial for GC and/or HPLC analysis of conversion and
enantiomeric excess of the product.
Biotransformations at elevated substrate concentrations using iso-
lated enzymes: A stock solution of IRED (2.11 mg/mL; final
concentration in reaction mixture: 2.0 mg/mL), Lb-ADH (2.11 mg/
mL; final concentration in reaction mixture: 2.0 mg/mL), and
NADP
+ (1.05 mM; final concentration in reaction mixture: 1.0 mM)
was prepared in the appropriate buffer (IREDs A–E, I–M: Tris-HCl,
100 mM, pH 7.5; IREDs F–H, N: potassium phosphate, 100 mM,
pH 6.0). The substrate 1 (5–250 mmol; final concentration in
reaction mixture: 10–500 mM) was weighed into a microcentrifuge
tube (2 mL) and dissolved in 2-propanol (25 mL). The enzyme/
cofactor stock solution (475 mL) was added and the samples were
incubated at 30 8C and 120 rpm in a shaking incubator for 24 h.
The biotransformations were then quenched by addition of sat. aq.
Na
2CO3 solution (200 mL) and the resulting solutions were extracted
with ethyl acetate (2 /C148 500mL; containing 10 mM n-dodecane as

centrifuged (13,000 rpm, 1 min), and the supernatant was trans-
ferred to a glass vial for GC and/or HPLC analysis of conversion and
enantiomeric excess of the product. Extracts from reactions
containing /C21 200 mM of substrate were diluted 5-fold prior to
analysis.
Preparative-scale imine reductions using isolated enzymes:
(S)-1-(2-Methylpiperidin-1-yl)ethanone. In an Erlenmeyer flask
(100 mL) with a glass joint, lyophilised, crude IRED- J (100 mg; final
concentration in reaction mixture: 2.0 mg/mL), lyophilised, crude
Lb-ADH (100 mg; final concentration in reaction mixture: 2.0 mg/
mL), and NADP
+ (40 mg; final concentration in reaction mixture:
1.0 mM) were dissolved in Tris-HCl buffer (47.5 mL; 100 mM,
pH 7.5). Imine 1b (486 mg, 5 mmol; final concentration in reaction
mixture: 100 mM) was dissolved in 2-propanol (2.5 mL; final
concentration in reaction mixture: 5 % v/v) and added to the
biocatalyst solution. The Erlenmeyer flask was closed with a rubber
septum and incubated at 30 8C and 120 rpm for 24 h, at which time
TLC (silica gel 60, MTBE:MeOH:NH
4OH =90 : 9 : 1, basic
permanganate staining) indicated completion of the biotransforma-
tion. The reaction mixture was transferred to a round-bottom flask
(250 mL) and saturated aqueous Na
2CO3 solution (20 mL) as well as
ethyl acetate (40 mL) were added. To the resulting biphasic mixture,
a solution of acetic anhydride (1.54 g, 15 mmol, 3 eq.) in ethyl
acetate (20 mL) was added dropwise over 15 min. The reaction
mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight (16 h), at which
time TLC (silica gel 60, MTBE:MeOH:NH

(R)-1-(2-Methylazepan-1-yl)ethanone. In an Erlenmeyer flask
(250 mL) with a screw cap, lyophilised E. coli ‘designer cells’ co-
expressing the IRED- D and Lb-ADH (2.0 g; final concentration in
reaction mixture: 20 g/L) were resuspended in Tris-HCl buffer
(100 mL; 100 mM, pH 7.5). Imine 1c (1.11 g, 10 mmol; final concen-
tration in reaction mixture: 100 mM) was dissolved in 2-propanol
(5.0 mL; final concentration in reaction mixture: 5 % v/v) and added
to the cell suspension. The Erlenmeyer flask was closed with a
screw cap and incubated at 30 8C and 120 rpm for 24 h, at which
time TLC (silica gel 60, MTBE : MeOH : NH

permanganate staining) indicated completion of the biotransforma-
tion. The reaction mixture was transferred to plastic centrifuge
tubes (2 /C148 50 mL) and centrifuged (4,000 rpm, 35 min) to pellet the
cells. The supernatant was transferred to a round-bottom flask
(500 mL) and saturated aqueous Na
2CO3 solution (40 mL) as well as
ethyl acetate (80 mL) were added. To the resulting biphasic mixture,
a solution of acetic anhydride (3.06 g, 30 mmol, 3 eq.) in ethyl
acetate (20 mL) was added dropwise over 15 min. The reaction
mixture was stirred at room temperature overnight (16 h), at which
time TLC (silica gel 60, MTBE : MeOH : NH
4OH =90 : 9 : 1, basic
permanganate staining) indicated completion of the derivatisation
reaction. The aqueous phase was saturated with NaCl and the
entire mixture was filtered through a pad (2 cm) of Celite in a glass
frit (Ø6 cm) to break the resulting emulsion. The phases were
separated, the aqueous phase was extracted with ethyl acetate (4 /C148
75 mL), and the combined organic phases were dried over Na
2SO4,
filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure to give 1.33 g of
