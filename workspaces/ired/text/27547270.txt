Although the range of biocatalysts available for the synthesis
of enantiomerically pure chiral amines continues to expand,
few existingm ethods provide access to secondary amines. To
address this shortcoming, we have over-expressed the gene
for an (R)-imine reductase [(R)-IRED] from Streptomyces sp.
GF3587 in Escherichia coli to create ar ecombinantw hole-cell
biocatalyst for the asymmetricr eduction of prochiral imines.
The (R)-IRED was screened against ap anel of cyclic imines and
two iminium ions and was shown to possess high catalytic ac-
tivity and enantioselectivity.P reparative-scale synthesis of the
alkaloid( R)-coniine (90 %y ield;9 9% ee)f rom the imine precur-
sor was performed on ag ram-scale. Ah omology model of the
enzymea ctive site, based on the structure of ac losely related
(R)-IRED from Streptomyces kanamyceticus,w as constructed
and used to identify potentiala mino acids as targets for muta-
genesis.
Chiral amines are key structural motifs widely found in many
naturalp roducts as well as pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals,
and fine chemicals.[1] Methods for their preparationi no ptically
pure form include organo- and transition-metal-catalyzed
asymmetrics ynthesis,[2] although approaches based on classi-
cal resolution throughc rystallization or kinetic resolution[3]
often remaint he method of choice in industry despite the
maximum theoretical yield capped at 50 %.[4] An alternative
and attractive strategy for chiral amine synthesis is to employ
enzymes, in particular biocatalysts the properties of which
have been tailored and enhanced by protein engineering and
directede volution.[5] Notable developments in this area include
the use of monoamine oxidases (MAO-N),[6] phenylalanine
ammonia lyases,[7] and aminotransferases (transaminases,
Scheme1 ).[8]
Additionally,a n l-amino-acid dehydrogenase has recently
been subjected to protein engineering and shown to catalyze
the asymmetric reductivea mination of ketones (amine dehy-
drogenases, Scheme 1).[9] In an umber of cases, these biocata-
lysts have been implemented in large-scale manufacturing pro-
cesses for the production of activep harmaceutical ingredients
as well as their key intermediates.[10]
With the exception of MAO-N, whichc an be used for the
chemoenzymatic deracemization of amines with broad struc-
tural features,t he majority of theseb iocatalysts generate only
primary amines,w ith no direct access to secondary or tertiary
amines.I nc ontrast,t he asymmetric reduction of imines pro-
vides an alternative methodf or generatingt hese motifs. Such
an approach has been explored by the development of che-
mocatalytic processes[11] and also the creationo fa rtificial met-
alloenzymes,[12] which have been successfully used in tandem
with biocatalystsi nc ascade reactions.[13] However,t he enzy-
matic equivalent of this process remains largely unexplored.[14]
Recently,a ni mine reductase [(S)-IRED] from Streptomyces sp.
GF3546 expressed in Escherichia coli[15] was shown to catalyze
the enantioselective reduction of ar ange of different imines,
including 2-substitutedc yclic imines, dihydroisoquinolines,
b-carbolines, and also iminium ions.[16] This (S)-IRED was found
to be exclusively dependento nt he cofactor NADPHa s
as ource of hydride.T he identification of enantiocomplementa-
ry enzymes that provide access to both enantiomers of target
products remains ak ey challenge in biocatalysis, which has
been addressed recently by the development of (R)-selective
transaminases[17] and an (R)-selective amine oxidase.[18] Herein

we report the heterologous expression and characterization of
an enantiocomplementary (R)-IRED from Streptomyces sp.
GF3587,w hich has been previously described and found to act
on 2-methyl-1-pyrroline 1a ,g iving some indication of sub-
strate preference.[19] In this communication, the (R)-IRED is
shown to possess aw ide substrate scope and has been ap-
plied to the synthesis of the alkaloid coniine 4i on ag ram
scale. Additionally,t he imine reductased isplayed significantly
higher catalytic activity than previously reported IREDs,w ith
ap reference for reducing 6-membered ring piperideine sub-
strates,w hich may provide insight into its natural substrate.
To explore the substrate scope of the (R)-IRED, ap anel of
cyclic imines was synthesized ands creenedf or activity.W ith
the exception of 1a ,a ll 2-substituted iminesw ere prepared by
ap reviously reportedm ethod[20] involving the addition of an
organometallic Grignard reagent to an N-Boc-protected lactam
(Boc =tert-butoxycarbonyl), followed by deprotection of the
amine, which undergoes spontaneous cyclization to give the
free-base cyclic imine. This flexible approach allowed access to
cyclic imines of varying ring sizes with ar ange of substituents.
The imines were isolated as their hydrochloride salts to en-
hance their stabilitya sw ell as water solubility.
Since the only previously reported substrate for the (R)-IRED
was 1a ,w hich gave excellent conversion( >98 %) and
ee (>98 %), our initial focus was directed towards screening
ar ange of 2-substituted pyrrolines.B iotransformations using
resting E. coli cells expressing the (R)-IRED were conducted at
substrate concentrations of 5m m with added glucose to aid
cofactor recycling (see Supporting Information for the condi-
tions used for cultivation of the recombinants train and expres-
sion of the (R)-IRED). Negativec ontrolsu sing cells harboring
the empty plasmid vector were run in parallel to ensure that
any observed activity occurred as ar esult of the IRED biocata-
lysts.
The (R)-IRED was shown to catalyzet he reduction of pyrro-
lines containing both aliphatic and aromatic substituents at
C-2 (Table 1). In addition to the reduction of 1a to (R)-2a [from
which the designation as (R)-IRED was derived] the phenyl-
and cyclohexyl-substituted pyrrolines 1b and 1e ,r espectively,
were fully converted after 24 h; however,as ignificant reduc-
tion in enantioselectivity was observed with these bulkiers ub-
stituents. When a para-methoxy substituent was introduced on
the benzene ring, conversion fell to 20 %b ut the reaction pro-
ceeded with excellent selectivity to give (S)-2c in >98 % ee.
Under the same conditions, the (R)-IRED gave significantly
higher conversions than the previously reported (S)-IRED for
pyrroline substrates 1a –d.
To further investigate the substrate scope of the (R)-IRED,
whole-cellb iotransformations werep erformed with larger 6-
and 7-membered-ring cyclic imine scaffolds. Tetrahydroaze-
pines 3a and 3c wereb oth convertedw ith excellents electivi-
ty.T he (R)-IRED was found to display particularly high activity
towards6 -membered rings,y ielding 2-substitutedp iperidines,
which are important scaffolds in many biologically significant
compounds.[21] The high activity towards this class of com-
poundi sa pparent if comparing the conversionso f para-
methoxyphenyl-substituted homologues 1c , 3c ,a nd 5c (con-
versions =20, 50, and /C2198 %, respectively). The biocatalytic re-
ductiono fa large panel of piperideines 5a –m was performed
to fully gauge the effects of varying substituents (Table 2).

benzyl-substituted derivative 5m and detectable conversion
was also observed with the bulky 1-naphthyl-substituted 5n ,
suggestive of an enzyme possessing al arge active site. For
substrates bearing phenyld erivatives, the introduction of
as ubstituent on the ring led to an increase in enantioselectivi-
ty.B oth electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups
were readily accepted, with high conversion and ee observed.
Interestingly,a moderate decrease in selectivity was observed
if moving the positiono ft he methoxy-substituentf rom para
to meta and ortho,s ignaling an increasing contribution of
ac ompeting binding mode in which the opposite face of the
imine is exposed for reduction by the NADPH.T he (R)-IRED
readily accepted other heterocyclic motifs including at hio-
phene ring (5l ).
With simple alkyl and alkenyl substituents,t he (R)-IRED
showede xcellent enantioselectivity.I na ddition, reduction of
a,b-unsaturated imine 5j proceeded exclusively at the carbon–
nitrogen double bond with no reduction of the alkene ob-
served. Reductiono f n-propyl-substituted piperideine 5i result-
ed in the formation of the more active (R)-enantiomer of the
natural product coniine in >98 % ee.T od emonstrate the appli-
cation of the (R)-IRED biocatalyst for preparative-scale synthesis
of chiral amines, the reduction of 5j was performed on a1 .0 g
(25 mm)s cale, yielding (R)-coniine 6i (90 %y ield, >98 % ee),
which was isolated as its hydrochlorides alt. In addition to
simple 2-substituted piperideines, 3,4-dihydroisoquinolines 7
and 7a were also confirmed to be substrates for the enzyme.
Significantly,t he corresponding N-methyl iminium derivatives
9 and 9a were also reduced, with chiral amine 10 a produced
with comparable selectivity (74 % ee), albeit with reduced con-
version, demonstrating the potential application of this biocat-
alyst for the synthesis of tertiaryc hiral amines.
Biotransformations of severals ubstrates conducted with the
isolated enzyme,c oupled with an NADPH cofactor recycling
system using glucose dehydrogenase 2f rom Bacillus megateri-
um,[22] showed no significant change in enantioselectivity if
compared to their whole-cell equivalents, with the exception
of dihydroisoquinoline 7a for which unusually the selectivity
appeared to diminisht og ive (R)-8a in 47 % ee (see Supporting
Information). As the whole-cell biocatalyst requires only the ad-
dition of glucosef or cofactor recycling and negates the neces-
sity of using large amounts of NADPH or an additional cofactor
recycling system, this approachw as used for any preparative
biotransformations.
Kineticp arameters were determined for representative sub-
strates (Table 3). Kinetic constants with the previously reported
(S)-IRED from Streptomyces sp. GF3546 have been described
with substrates 1a , 3a , 5a , 7, 7a ,a nd 9 (i.e., kcat =0.024 s/C01,
0.039 s/C01,0 .137 s/C01,0 .445 s/C01,0 .040 s/C01,a nd 0.483 s/C01,r espec-
tively).[16] Excluding 7,s ignificantly higher kcat values andl ower
Michaelis constants (Km)w ere observed for the (R)-IRED de-
scribed herein (Table 3). The previously reporteds ubstrate 2-
methyl-1-pyrroline 1a had an otably lower kcat/Km value (cata-
lytic efficiency) than severalp iperideine substrates tested. In
particular, we observed ag reater than sixty-fold increase in
kcat/Km for 2-methyl-1-piperideine 5a over pyrroline 1a .T his
preference for 6- and 7-membered ring systems is shared with
the (S)-IRED and may allude to the natural function of this
class of enzyme. The (R)-IRED also displayed greater activity to-
wards simple alkyl- and alkenyl-substituted imines compared
with those bearing aromatic moieties.
As election of ketones and oximes were screened for activity
with the (R)-IRED, with no conversion detected (see Supporting
Information). The absence of activity towards ketones suggests
future potential applications of this enzymef or intermolecular
reductivea minations, which remains as ignificant challenge in
organic synthesis.
We have recently determined the structure of oxidoreduc-
tase Q1EQE0 from Streptomyces kanamyceticus,[22] which shares
50 %s equence identityw ith the (R)-IRED,a nd which also cata-
lyzes the (R)-selective reduction of imine substrates such as 2-
methyl-1-pyrroline 1a .T he structureo fQ 1EQE0 revealed ad i-
meric associationi nw hicht wo monomers associate very close-
ly through domain swapping. The active site, containing
NADPH, is ac hannelt hat traverses the width of the dimer.T he
active site also revealed residues which mayb er esponsible for
catalysis, including Asp187, which was proposed to be the cat-
alytic residue for protonation of the imine in IRED-mediated
catalysis.[22] The similarity between the two sequences gave us
confidence to build am odel of the (R)-IRED (Figure 1a )u sing
the Phyre2 server.[23] In the model,A sp187 in Q1EQE0i sc on-
servedi nt he (R)-IRED as Asp172 and many of the other resi-
dues within the region of the active site also appear to be con-
servedb etween the two enzymes (Figure 1b ).
The role of Asp172 in the catalytic mechanism was further
probedb yg eneration of the Asp172Ala and Asp172Lysp oint
mutantsb ys ite-directedm utagenesis. Interestingly,b oth mu-
tants retained catalytic activity although conversions were gen-
erally lower,f or example, for 5c the conversion was reduced
from 92 %f or the wild-type isolated protein to 40 %a nd 72 %
for the Asp172Ala and Asp172Lys mutants, respectively.R e-
markably,r eductiono f 5a by the mutants showed no change
in enantioselectivity whereas for 7a the ee value was increased
to 81 %f or the Asp172Ala variant (Table 4). These initial studies
highlight the importance of this residue as ah otspotf or muta-
genesist oi mprove conversionsa nd/or enantioselectivity.

cell biocatalyst possessing broad substrate scope,s uitable for

the preparation of chiral cyclic secondary amines with broad
structural features and with two examples of tertiarya mine
synthesis also demonstrated. The activity of the (R)-IRED was
shown to be orders of magnitude higher than previously re-
ported imine reductases, which is significant forp otentiali n-
dustrial applications.[14] Although wild-type IREDs appear to
possess relatively broad substrate specificity,f urthere ngineer-
ing through directed evolution and rational design, using the
protein model presented herein,w ill undoubtedly lead to
more active biocatalysts.[25] Moreover,t he opportunity to com-
bine IREDs with existing biocatalysts in cascade reactions[26]
should result in greater application of thesee nzymes in asym-
metric synthesis.
