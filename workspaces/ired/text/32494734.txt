Imine reductases (IREDs) have shown great potential as catalysts for the asymmetric synthesis of industrially relevant 
chiral amines, but a limited understanding of sequence activity relationships makes rational engineering challenging. 
Here, we describe the characterization of 80 putative and 15 previously described IREDs across 10 different trans-
formations and confirm that reductive amination catalysis is not limited to any particular subgroup or sequence 
motif. Furthermore, we have identified another dehydrogenase subgroup with chemoselectivity for imine reduc-
tion. Enantioselectivities were determined for the reduction of the model substrate 2-phenylpiperideine, and the 
effect of changing the reaction conditions was also studied for the reductive aminations of 1-indanone, acetophe-
none, and 4-methoxyphenylacetone. We have performed sequence-structure analysis to help explain clusters in 
activity across a phylogenetic tree and to inform rational engineering, which, in one case, has conferred a 
change in chemoselectivity that had not been previously observed.
INTRODUCTION
Imine reductases (IREDs) are nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide 
phosphate (NADPH)–dependent enzymes that have been applied 
to the stereoselective synthesis of chiral amines through asymmetric 
imine reduction and reductive amination (1, 2). A number of pharma-
ceuticals, agrochemicals, and natural products contain one or more 
chiral amine functionalities, with examples including the anti-  
Parkinson’s agent pramipexole (3 ), the tuberculosis treatment 
ethambutol (4 ), and the natural product histrionicotoxin (5 ). 
While amine dehydrogenases and transaminases have previously 
been exploited in the direct conversion of carbonyl-containing 
compounds to the corresponding chiral primary amines (6 , 7), 
only IREDs have been shown to catalyze reductive amination with 
multiple different amine nucleophiles, including the secondary 
amine pyrrolidine (8 ), at concentrations within an order of 
magnitude of that of the cosubstrate ketone or aldehyde (9). Asym-
metric reductive amination requires high chemoselectivity to avoid 
direct reduction of the carbonyl starting material, and existing 
chemical catalyst systems that fulfill this requirement tend to be 
limited to a particular class of amine nucleophile, such as anilines 
(10) or ammonia (11).
The first IREDs were identified by Mitsukura et al. (12,  13) on 
the basis of their ability to catalyze the enantioselective reduction of 
the synthetic imine 2-methylpyrroline. Subsequently, a much broader 
range of wild-type IREDs have been found and applied to the syn-
thesis of a range of cyclic amines, including tetrahydroisoquinolines 
and piperidines (14), 3-thiazolines (15), bulky ,-unsaturated imines 
(16), and 2H-1,4-benzoxazines (17). IREDs have also been applied 
in cascades for the deracemization of racemic amines (18) and for 
the direct synthesis of chiral amines from simple precursors (Fig. 1) 
(19, 20), in some cases with closed-loop recycling of the nicotin-
amide cofactor (21,  22). Recently, they have been used in new 
chemoenzymatic methods for the synthesis of pharmaceutically rel-
evant dibenz[c,e]azepines (23) and 2,2-disubstituted azepanes (24). 
However, despite promising results in the reductive aminations 
of cyclohexanone and a range of aldehydes, for ketones such as 
1-indanone and 4-fluorophenylacetone, more than 20 equivalents 
of amine nucleophile were required to achieve only moderate con-
versions (2,  9, 25). Likewise, although good conversions were ob-
served in the reductive amination of simple cyclic ketones such as 
cyclohexanone with ammonia, no conversion has yet been observed 
using ammonia for the amination of aldehydes. The scope of reac-
tions performed by IREDs in nature is generally unknown, although 
the ArpDHII enzyme from Streptomyces argillaceus, which shares 
36% sequence identity with the reductive aminase from Aspergillus 
oryzae (AspRedAm) (2), has been assigned a role in argimycin bio-
synthesis (26).
In the course of their biochemical characterization, several spe-
cific residues have been proposed to help control IRED selectivity 
and substrate scope. Hussain et al. (14) had observed that the D172A 
and D172L variants of R-IRED from Streptomyces sp. GF3587 both 
showed decreases in conversion for more bulky substrates, typically 
also with a reduction in ee (enantiomeric excess), and Aleku et al. (2) 
then showed that a Q240A mutant of AspRedAm gives improved 
conversions with certain ketones. However, France et al. (8) noted 
that only one of the six “key residues” that had been proposed to confer 
activity in fungal reductive aminases was conserved among several 
bacterial IREDs, which gave high conversions in reductive amination. 
Nonetheless, the importance of these residues in reductive aminase 
catalysis is supported by crystallographic data and engineering studies 
(27). The diversity of active site motifs in characterized IREDs indi-
cates that this activity may not be confined to a narrow subset of 
dehydrogenases and could be less unusual than first anticipated.

With a view to applying IREDs on scale, Roiban and co-workers 
(9) studied the reductive amination of a variety of carbonyl substrates 
with aniline and related nucleophiles. Conversions of up to 99% were 
achieved with 1.1 equivalents of aniline in the reductive amination 
of cyclohexanone (0.4 g), and a more recent study by Bornadel et al. 
(28) demonstrated intensification of an IRED-catalyzed reductive 
amination reaction to reach a space time yield of 12.9 g liter−1 hour−1. 
Most recently, Roiban and co-workers have described the directed 
evolution of an IRED for the synthesis of a lysine specific demethylase 1 
inhibitor on multikilogram scale, with the transformation run under 
acidic conditions. The most improved variant had significantly higher 
activity and stability under the desired reaction conditions compared 
to the wild-type enzyme, but because of the lack of an effective 
colorimetric assay, the work required a sophisticated automated 
platform. Of 296 amino acids, 256 were varied by single-site satura-
tion mutagenesis, and in total, more than 9000 variants were screened 
by ultraperformance liquid chromatography across three rounds of 
mutagenesis (29).
To explore structure-activity relationships across the IRED family 
more deeply, we prepared a panel of 95 enzymes, containing 80 
putative IREDs from fungi, bacteria, and plants alongside 13 previously 
described IREDs (8, 9, 13, 14, 24, 30) and two RedAms (2, 27). Here, 
we describe their biochemical characterization in five different re-
ductive aminations and the reduction of 2-phenylpiperideine (1 ), 
to establish the substrate scope of wild-type IREDs for chemical 
synthesis and the further characterization of a subset of these in 
seven more reductive aminations (Fig. 2). For a reductive amination 
with aniline that typically gave low conversion, the use of cosolvents 
has been explored as a way of alleviating substrate inhibition and 
increasing conversion without mutagenesis. An alternative structural 
analysis approach was then explored, whereby contacts were deter-
mined between amino acid residues, considering all rotameric states, 
and the docked substrate, which was given a certain degree of 
conformational freedom. These hypothetical contact points were 
compared across the sequences to determine potential structure-  
activity relationships. On the basis of this analysis, an enzyme with 
negligible activity was mutated to establish the validity of the 
structure- activity model. Structural differences between fungal 
RedAms and newly characterized IREDs from plants were also 
examined, to explore whether domain swapping is necessary for 
IRED chemoselectivity. Last, we tested a new hypothesis about the 
ubiquity of reductive amination activity by comparing the conversions 
obtained with the biosynthetic bacterial IRED ArpDHII with those 
previously reported with the reductive aminase AspRedAm.
RESULTS
Sequence selection and initial characterization
For the purposes of this study, we identified a diverse selection of 
genomic putative IREDs, which were then cloned into Escherichia coli. 
Putative IREDs were initially selected from bacterial and fungal sources 
on the basis of searches of the UniProt database (31) and the laboratory 
culture collection for putative proteins with sequence identity of 
>30% with AspRedAm or a bit score higher than 50, but without 
bias toward particular active site motifs. Subsequently, the search 
was narrowed to proteins identified within plant genomes, and the 
presence of an nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)–binding 
domain (PF03446) was used to select 26 putative dehydrogenases 
from a group with no more than 27% sequence identity with the 
fungal RedAm.
The resulting enzyme panel contains previously uncharacterized 
enzymes from a range of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, ranging from 
17 to 62% sequence identity to AspRedAm. The diversity of this panel 
is demonstrated with different putative IREDs across the whole tree 
of life (fig. S1). Rather than falling into a single clade, the fungal 
enzymes are divided into two groups, with two further outliers in the 
putative IREDs p-IR36 and p-IR62 from Fonsecaea multimorphosa 
and Pochonia chlamydosporia, respectively. The putative actinobacteri-
al IREDs are also split across the tree. The putative dehydrogenases 
that are of plant origin fall into a distinct clade and match two dif-
ferent Pfam signatures, PF03446 (the NAD-binding domain of 
6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenases) and PF14833. The former spans 
approximately 160 residues from the N terminus and is detected in 
all the sequences considered here. For the putative IREDs from 
plants, the first 120 residues from the N terminus in the same NAD- 
binding domain also match the signature for the NAD-binding domain 
of 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenases, which have been compared 
to IREDs in sequence studies by Fademrecht et al. (32).
The putative IREDs were initially screened for conversion in the 
asymmetric reduction of 1 to 2-phenylpiperidine 2. Soluble expression 
was interpreted as good, moderate, or poor, and the observed con-
versions and enantioselectivities were compared to those of R-IRED 
and S-IRED from Streptomyces sp. (12, 13) that were used as positive 
controls (fig. S2). A clarified lysate of cells containing empty 
pET-28b(+) vector was used as a negative control. Of 90 cell-free 
extracts, 57 putative IREDs showed moderate or good expression 
based on SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Sixty percent of 
the enzymes (54 putative IREDs) gave at least 10% conversion in the 
reduction of 1  after 18 hours, including 10 of those that did not 
express well, and 30% of the panel gave >98% conversion. Of the 
enzymes that gave at least 10% conversion to 2, 21 putative IREDs 
gave >90% ee, although only one of these enzymes was (R)-selective. 
While S-IRED and p-IR49 were (R)-selective for 2, the closely related 
p-IR23, p-IR24, p-IR48, and p-IR68 were all highly (S )-selective. 
Having collated a diverse panel of enzymes, we then sought to 
explore their synthetic potential in a range of reductive amination 
reactions, with a view to comparing reaction outcomes across the 
sequence space.

Nucleophile scope in biocatalytic reductive amination
To explore conversions with a lower (2:1) stoichiometry of amine 
nucleophile to cyclohexanone, we characterized the enzyme panel with 
respect to conversion in the reductive aminations of cyclohexanone 
with butylamine, phenethylamine, and aniline. The previously 
characterized R-IRED and S-IRED from Streptomyces sp. (12,  13), 
SkIRED from Streptomyces kanamyceticus (30), AspRedAm, and its 
homolog AtRedAm (2 ) were also included as positive controls. 
Butylamine and aniline were chosen for being chemically distinct, 
and since phenethylamine shares properties with both, the resulting 
set of conversions would illustrate whether the aryl group or the 
lone pair stabilization of aniline have a more significant effect on 
conversion. While the products of these transformations are not 
known to be of practical interest, aside from any value added 
through amination, they allowed us to map variations in conversion 
and substrate preference across the panel.
In the reductive amination of cyclohexanone with cyclopropylamine 
to yield N-cyclopropylcyclohexylamine 3, 57 of the putative IREDs 
gave at least 10% conversion (Fig. 3), and the activities largely correlate 
with those seen in the reduction of 1. However, while p-IR05 gave 
no measurable conversion in imine reduction, it gave 38% conversion 
to 3. This effect is even more marked for p-IR14, p-IR19, and p-IR83, 
all of which gave more than 80% higher conversion in this reductive 
amination reaction compared to imine reduction. The opposite 
substrate preference is also noticeable in some cases, particularly 
with p-IR11 (81% conversion to 2 and 21% conversion to 3).
In general, full conversion was not observed with butylamine, 
phenethylamine, or aniline, with only 13 of 90 enzymes appearing 
to give more than 50% conversion to N -butylcyclohexylamine 4 
after 18 hours, compared to 52 of 90 for 3. Conversions in the re-
ductive amination of cyclohexanone with phenethylamine to yield 
N-cyclohexylphenethylamine 5 and aniline to yield N-cyclohexylaniline 
6 were somewhat correlated, although only seven enzymes gave 
>30% conversion to 6. SkIRED that was first described in 2013 (30) 
proved to be one of the most active biocatalysts for the reductive 
amination of cyclohexanone with aniline, giving 92% conversion. 
Of the enzymes that gave less than 20% conversion to 3 , only 
p-IR65 gave any significant conversion in reductive aminations 
at low stoichiometries. This IRED was also the only enzyme in the 
panel which gave >99% conversion in cyclic imine reduction with-
out concomitant high conversion in the reductive amination of 
cyclohexanone.

Direct reductive amination with ammonia continues to be of 
interest for the synthesis of chiral primary amines and has advantages 
over enzymatic transamination in terms of its atom economy. The 
reductive amination of 2-methylcyclohexanone with ammonia to 
give 2-methylcyclohexylamine 7 was therefore investigated with the 
same enzyme panel. Ammonia was applied at a higher concentration 
of 400 mM (40 equivalents with respect to 2-methylcyclohexanone), 
with the ammonium chloride solution also acting as the reaction 
buffer. Although the conversions to 7 correlated well with the total 
conversions to 3, the reactions with ammonia typically did not go to 
completion. The syn/anti-selectivity was also quite poor, which 
suggests that the methyl group has a limited influence on the mode 
of binding, although there are some general trends where enzymes 
in the same clade largely favor the same diastereomer. For example, 
AspRedAm, AtRedAm, p-IR9, and p-IR16 all favor one product, 
whereas p-IR58, p-IR88, p-IR78, p-IR50, p-IR89, and p-IR90 favor 
the other.
On the basis of the initial results, 35 of the least active IREDs were 
excluded from further screening with more challenging substrates. In 
experiments to date, IREDs have been found to give lower conversions 
with more sterically demanding amines. For example, with purified 
AspRedAm, 20 equivalents of isopropylamine were required to obtain

94% conversion in the reductive amination of cyclohexanone to 
yield N-isopropylcyclohexylamine 8 (2). Forty-five novel and 13 
previously characterized IREDs were screened in the same reaction 
with 10 equivalents isopropylamine (fig. S3), and the highest con-
versions to product were obtained with p-IR31 (44%) and p-IR90 
(49%). However, 53% of the panel gave no conversion, indicating 
that screening of multiple wild-type enzymes remains necessary to 
find hits for more challenging nucleophile substrates.
Biocatalytic reductive amination with novel  
ketone substrates
The smaller panel of IREDs was then tested in the reductive amination 
of a number of prochiral ketones (Fig. 4). The reaction of 1-indanone 
with propargylamine was studied at both 30° and 37°C, with greater 
conversions to N-propargyl-1-aminoindan 9 being observed across 
the panel at the higher temperature. Acetophenone, a precursor to 
active pharmaceutical ingredients such as rivastigmine (33), was then 
used as a substrate with either 10 equivalents of cyclopropylamine 
at 37°C or 20 equivalents at 30°C. While none of the enzymes gave 
full conversion to N-(1-phenylethyl)cyclopropanamine 10, the mean 
conversion to product at 30°C was higher than for that of 1-indanone 
(19% versus 10%), as was the highest conversion obtained (59% ver-
sus 28%). When mapped phylogenetically, the enzymes’ conversion 
to 10 correlates well with that observed for the reductive amination 
of 1-indanone, although some show a preference for one over the 
other. Again, the IREDs gave higher conversions at 37°C than at 
30°C, although the highest conversions (59% with p-IR58 and 55% 
with p-IR13) were obtained at 30°C with the higher concentration 
of cyclopropylamine. Some groups of related enzymes give similar 
conversions, with the fungal enzymes generally giving better con-
versions than R-IRED, SkIRED, and their bacterial homologs.
The stability and substrate scope of the novel IREDs was further 
investigated through the reductive amination of two phenylacetone 
derivatives under different conditions. The mean conversions in the 
reductive aminations of 4-hydroxyphenylacetone with cyclopropylamine 
to give 4-[2-(cyclopropylamino)propyl]phenol 11 at 30°C and those 
of 4-methoxyphenylacetone with cyclopropylamine to give N -[1-
(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-propanyl]cyclopropanamine 12 at 37°C were 
24 and 35%, respectively, with 10 mM ketone, although both reac-
tions went to completion with at least seven IREDs. For the reductive 
amination of 4-methoxyphenylacetone, with 10 mM ketone and 
100 mM cyclopropylamine, 10 enzymes gave >90% conversion. 
When the transformation was repeated with 100 mM ketone and 
200 mM amine nucleophile, only p-IR06, p-IR13, p-IR16, and p-IR23 
gave >90% conversion, indicating that these enzymes have greater 
stability under increased substrate loading. Substrate inhibition is a 
limiting factor in the application of enzymes on a larger scale, the 
ability of these enzymes to tolerate high substrate loading demon-
strates these enzymes are good tools for process chemistry. Note that 
the increased ketone concentration without a proportional increase 
in the amount of cyclopropylamine leads to an improved reaction 
stoichiometry of 2:1, which has not previously been demonstrated for 
IRED-catalyzed reductive amination of a phenylacetone derivative.
Last, the enzyme panel was characterized in terms of its activity 
in the reductive amination of methoxyacetone to yield N-benzyl-1-
methoxy-2-propylamine 13 (fig. S4), to explore the possibility of 
accessing members of the chloroacetanilide family of herbicides. The 
panel was also screened in the reductive amination of cyclohexanone 
with benzylamine to yield N -benzylcyclohexylamine 14, with the 
conversion data serving as a control for variations in amine substrate 
scope. Three enzymes, p-IR06, p-IR17, and p-IR79, gave greater than 
30% conversion with methoxyacetone, and these IREDs also gave >60% 
conversion in the reductive amination of cyclohexanone with 
benzylamine. Several typically productive enzymes including p-IR16, 
p-IR23, p-IR63, and SkIRED gave no conversion with methoxyacetone.
Reaction intensification with aniline
With a large set of sequence and conversion data in hand, we elected 
to explore the use of cosolvents as a way of increasing conversion in 
reductive amination without resorting to directed evolution. The 
reductive amination of cyclohexanone with aniline catalyzed by 
p-IR89 was selected as a model transformation in which moderate 
conversion had been obtained, but the reaction did not go to comple-
tion within 24 hours. To profile the effect of solvents with different 
polarities, we investigated different percentages of cyclohexane, 
methanol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and tert-butyl methyl ether 
(MTBE) (table S1). Of the four tested cosolvents, cyclohexane was 
the best tolerated, with 10, 20, and 50% by volume all giving higher 
conversions than a purely aqueous transformation [up to 41% with 
10% (v/v) cyclohexane]. MTBE and ethanol were inhibitory, while up 
to 20% (v/v) DMSO was well tolerated (31% conversion after 18 hours). 
A complete lack of DMSO appeared to have a deleterious effect on con-
version compared to the screening conditions, where the addition 
of substrates from 1 M stock solutions gave a final composition of 
3% (v/v) DMSO. In further experiments, conversion to 6 reached 81% 
when the reaction was run with 50 mM cyclohexanone and 100 mM 
aniline with a 200- l layer of cyclohexane cosolvent (Table 1). 
Pushpanath et al. (7) have previously demonstrated that a biphasic 
reaction system can lead to improved conversions with amine 
dehydrogenases, an effect that was attributed to alleviation of product 
inhibition, and this would explain the improvement in conversion 
observed here, since aniline has a relatively low solubility in water 
compared to cyclohexane. 
Structure-activity relationships
In analyzing the results of screening across a variety of ketone and 
amine substrate combinations, we observed markedly different sub-
strate specificities between several enzymes with high sequence identity 
and similar expression levels. We also observed some grouping of 
enantioselectivities in imine reduction based on sequence similarity. 
To shed light on some of the observed trends, we performed a 
sequence-structure analysis using the SmartScaffold approach. This 
analysis involves advanced, multitemplate homology modeling, flexible 
docking, and a custom functionality Structure and Ligand-based and 
Active site Prediction (SLAP) that defines the extended active site 
through the study of steric clashes and contacts between the protein 
model and a conformational ensemble of the best scoring docked poses.
On the basis of structure-guided sequence alignment of active 
site residues for six enzymes from the original panel, we determined 
that the two strongly (R)-selective enzymes (p-IR49 and S-IRED) 
have the residues Pro 121, Phe 176, Met/Ile 210, and Ser 243 based on 
AspRedAm numbering, while several of the strongly (S )-selective 
enzymes including R-IRED, p-IR64, and p-IR48 have Thr 121, Met/
Leu176, Phe/Trp210, and Ala243. The Pro121/Phe176 combination cor-
responds to the SkIRED 139/194 motif used by Fademrecht et al. 
(32) in their selectivity classification of putative IREDs, although 
this categorization does not hold true for all IREDs described to 
date (9, 34).

We also observed that several bacterial IREDs, such as SkIRED 
and p-IR23, gave higher conversions in the reductive amination re-
actions with phenethylamine and aniline than the fungal reductive 
aminases AspRedAm and AtRedAm. A comparison of the active 
site residues highlighted in mechanistic studies of fungal RedAms 
(27) across eight of the most active novel IREDs, as well as AspRedAm, 
SkIRED, p-IR23, and p-IR48, shows that only Asp 169 is fully con-
served, although the bacterial IREDs do have several residues in

common (table S2). Because of the diversity of sequences within the 
panel, a more detailed comparison focused on groups of well-expressed 
IREDs with high sequence identity that gave markedly different 
conversions.
p-IR23 and p-IR48 were both well expressed and gave >99% 
conversion to product in the reductive amination of cyclohexanone 
with cyclopropylamine, but p-IR23 gave much higher conversion in 
the reductive amination with aniline (96% versus 5%). Homology 
models of p-IR23 and p-IR48 were generated using the “closed” 
form of AspRedAm [Protein Data Bank (PDB) code: 5G6S] as a 
template, and the substrates cyclohexanone and aniline were docked 
to determine which residues they would be likely to interact with. 
The result was a list of 23 residues that could come into contact with 
one or both of the substrates (Fig. 5A). By limiting the analysis to 
this subset of residues, it becomes clearer how the activity of 
p-IR48 in the reductive amination of cyclohexanone with aniline 
might be improved through rational mutagenesis, especially since 
19 are conserved between p-IR23 and p-IR48, with four amino 
acids potentially having a greater effect on substrate binding. The 
amino acids in AspRedAm-equivalent positions 170 (Ser/Thr), 176 
(Leu/Met), and 180 (Met/Leu) are the most similar in terms of their 
chemical properties, making 244 (Leu/Phe) a clear candidate for 
mutagenesis. Two mutants of p-IR48 were generated, in which either 
AspRedAm-equivalent residue 244 (p-IR48 F246L) or residues 170, 
176, 180, and 244 (p-IR48 T172S/M178L/L182M/F246L) were switched 
with those in p-IR23. These enzymes were expressed, purified, and 
tested for conversion in the reductive amination of cyclohexanone 
with two equivalents of aniline at several time points alongside 
purified wild-type p-IR23 and p-IR48 (Fig. 5B). The quadruple mutant 
of p-IR48 was unstable and gave negligible, but the F246L mutant 
gave increased conversion compared to the wild-type (6% versus 
2% over 24 hours). This mutation also gave rise to an increase in the 
amount of alcohol by-product formed due to direct reduction of the 
ketone. Since the conversion to both possible products showed a 
threefold increase from the wild-type to the mutant, it is not clear 
whether the mutation has increased alcohol dehydrogenase activity 
at the expense of IRED activity or whether opening of the active site 
has resulted in higher activity in all capacities.
We also considered whether the different residues at AspRedAm- 
equivalent position 210 (Tyr in p-IR23 versus Phe in p-IR48), which 
were not picked up using the analysis platform but had been shown 
to confer changes in activity for AspRedAm (2), might explain the 
difference in conversion with aniline. To explore this, we tested the 
corresponding F209Y mutant of p-IR48 for conversion to 6 under 
the same conditions. However, no conversion to the secondary 
amine was observed. Although this does not confirm that the list of 
contact points identified by the SmartScaffold tool is exhaustive, in 
this case, it appears that residue 210 is also not solely responsible for 
differences in conversion between the two wild-type enzymes.
The same sequence-structure analysis can be used to make similar 
comparisons with the other IRED and substrate combinations. For 
example, p-IR08 and p-IR13 both gave full conversion in the reductive 
amination of 4-hydroxyphenylacetone with cyclopropylamine to yield 
11, yet p-IR07 and p-IR28 gave only 30 and 11% conversion respectively. 
Here, the results of homology modeling with AspRedAm and docking 
with 11 indicated 41 residues that could potentially be in contact with 
the product, of which 23 are conserved across all five enzymes (table S3). 
Similarly, no single sequence motif appears to preclude activity toward 
methoxyacetone, although 10 of 27 identified contact point residues 
are not shared by any other active enzymes in the panel.
Last, noting that the novel IREDs from plants have low sequence 
identity with AspRedAm and fall into a distinct clade on the phylo-
genetic tree, we used homology modeling to investigate their structure. 
p-IR14 from Arabidopsis thaliana shares 26% sequence identity to 
the -hydroxyacid dehydrogenase from the same organism (-HADAt; 
PDB code: 3DOJ) but only 18% sequence identity with AspRedAm. 
Although these enzymes showed markedly lower soluble expression 
in E. coli, several including p-IR14, p-IR-31, and p-IR56 gave >90% 
conversion in the reductive amination of cyclohexanone with cyclo-
propylamine. Crucially, this transformation requires that the enzyme 
be chemoselective for the imine over the cyclohexanone, direct 
reduction of which would yield cyclohexanol. Not only do these 
enzymes have different amino acids in all areas of their structure 
proposed to be important for catalysis, but on the basis of homology 
modeling with -HADAt, they also appear to have a different quaternary 
structure to previously characterized IREDs such as AspRedAm (fig. S5). 
Rather than interlocking, the two subunits sit parallel, a structural dif-
ference that had previously been proposed to distinguish -hydroxyacid 
dehydrogenases from IREDs (32). These results, along with recent 
mutagenesis studies performed by Nestl and co-workers (35), indicate 
that IREDs may not require domain swapping to exhibit their unique 
catalytic properties.
Reductive amination with ArpDHII from S. argillaceus
In the course of this study, an IRED (ArpDHII) was identified in the 
biosynthesis of polyketide alkaloids in S. argillaceus ( 26). This

enzyme has 36% identity with AspRedAm, more than p-IR23, p-IR48, 
and many of the other active biocatalysts for reductive amination 
discussed herein (fig. S6). On the basis of the data obtained through 
screening, we came to believe that reductive amination catalysis is a 
promiscuous activity common to almost all IREDs and felt that 
similar conversions being obtained using an IRED with a known 
cyclic imine natural substrate would support this conclusion. Purified 
ArpDHII was therefore tested for conversion in several biotransforma-
tions that had previously been reported with purified AspRedAm, 
to compare its activity and substrate scope (table S4) (2). ArpDHII 
gave lower conversion than AspRedAm in 7 of 10 reactions, and no 
conversion was observed in the reductive amination of 1-indanone 
with 250 mM propargylamine. However, the S. argillaceus enzyme 
did give good conversion to 3 (93% after 18 hours), and the reduc-
tive amination of hydrocinnamaldehyde was successful with three 
different amine nucleophiles, giving >89% conversion to product in 
all cases.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we have provided a more complete description of the 
IREDs and RedAms as a diverse family of promiscuous dehydrogenases 
and improved tools to map IRED sequence-activity relationships. 
We identified 45 novel IREDs, 33 of which gave >10% conversion in 
reductive amination at a 2:1 amine:ketone stoichiometry, from a 
panel of 80 putative dehydrogenase enzymes including 25 from plant 
origin in the “twilight zone” of sequence identity with AspRedAm. 
Of these, 12 enzymes were found to catalyze the reductive amina-
tion of cyclohexanone with cyclopropylamine (>10% conversion), 
including one with just 17.1% sequence identity with AspRedAm 
(p-IR56 from Nicotiana attenuata).
Empirical characterization of the putative IREDs alongside 15 pre-
viously described IREDs across 12 substrate combinations in reductive 
amination led to the identification of biocatalysts for six new substrate 
combinations, including six enzymes that effectively (>70% conversion) 
catalyze the reductive amination of 4-methoxyphenylacetone at 
100 mM ketone concentration and a 1:2 stoichiometry with cyclo-
propylamine. However, the reductive aminations of both 1-indanone 
and acetophenone appear to always require >10 equivalents of amine 
nucleophile to achieve good conversion to product. Of the novel 
IREDs, p-IR09 and p-IR16 have been identified as good scaffolds 
for engineering, since they are active, tolerate increased substrate 
concentrations, express well, and their close homology with AspRedAm 
means that their active site residues are more likely to be mapped

accurately. Nonetheless, no single enzyme gave the best conversion 
for every substrate combination, and no single clade contains all the 
most active enzymes for a given transformation. For example, p-IR57 
shares only 23.5% sequence identity with SkIRED, yet they gave 
comparable conversions to 3 and 11. For the reductive amination of 
cyclohexanone with aniline, where substrate inhibition limits turn-
over, a biphasic reaction system with cyclohexane has been shown 
to significantly improve total conversion to product. This highlights 
the significant role of reaction conditions in biocatalysis, a factor 
that is often not explored in initial screening of wild-type enzymes 
or engineered variants.
Despite their diversity, the active novel IREDs herein all catalyze 
reductive amination of the model substrate cyclohexanone, yet no 
single enzyme was found to give the highest conversion across all 
the tested reaction conditions and substrate combinations. Nonethe-
less, where resources are limited, we conclude that a lack of conver-
sion in both the reduction of 1  and the reductive amination of 
cyclohexanone with cyclopropylamine might be a sufficient basis 
to exclude an enzyme from further screening.
On the basis of the comparison of conversions to product with 
positioning on a phylogenetic tree, it appears that the substrate 
scope of an IRED in terms of carbonyl compounds and amine nucleo-
philes might be controlled by different regions in the protein structure. 
A sequence-structure analysis has been used to map possible contact 
points for a subset of enzymes and substrate pairs, and interchange 
of residues between p-IR23 and p-IR48 highlighted a possible role 
of Leu/Phe244 (AspRedAm numbering) in catalysis and selectivity. 
This residue is also the only identified contact point for the reduc-
tive amination of 4-hydroxyphenylacetone with cyclopropylamine, 
which varies between IREDs p-IR07 and p-IR08, despite the consider-
able difference in conversion obtained with cell-free extracts con-
taining the two enzymes (30 and 99%, respectively). Both were well 
expressed in E. coli, so it seems unlikely that the discrepancy would 
be due to a difference in biocatalyst concentration alone, although 
stability could play a role. However, while for 6, the higher-converting 
p-IR23 does not have Phe at this position, for 12, the presence of 
Phe at position 244 is associated with the higher conversion.
The approach described herein would be bolstered by an improved 
active site model based on crystal structures with complementary 
molecular dynamics simulations, to account for domain movements 
during catalysis (2, 27), and the use of this method to perform semi-
rational engineering would most likely expedite the development of new 
IRED-catalyzed processes compared to a very broad directed evolution 
approach such as that described by Schober et al. (29). Where the 
goal is to improve an enzyme’s stability under process parameters, it 
can be necessary to target residues away from the active site, and tools 
to predict the results of these changes are still in their infancy. Even with 
our systematic approach, we have demonstrated that it is difficult to 
effect a change in activity of an IRED, especially with the concomitant 
effects of sequence changes on heterologous expression and stability.
Last, the study of the biosynthetic enzyme ArpDHII showed that 
an IRED that evolved to reduce cyclic imines can still effectively 
perform intermolecular reductive amination with certain substrates 
and suggests that “reductive aminase” activity observed to date in 
enzymes of fungal is likely to be a result of enzyme promiscuity. It 
appears that the majority of IREDs can usefully be applied in inter-
molecular reductive amination and this activity is not limited to a 
single set of active site residues. For the reductive amination of cy-
clohexanone with aniline, the highest conversions were obtained with 
enzymes from bacteria. The very high conversions to 3, and in all 
three reductive aminations of hydrocinnamaldehyde, suggest that 
ArpDHII shares the excellent chemoselectivity of AspRedAm. We 
believe that this is because ArpDHII evolved to only reduce the cyclic 
imine nigrifactin without also reducing the carbonyl in the hydro-
lyzed aminoketone form or the polyketide intermediates in argimycin 
biosynthesis (26). The occurrence of IRED-catalyzed reductive 
amination as a promiscuous activity could explain why it is a rela-
tively slow process compared to other biocatalytic aminations and 
also why, in our case, attempts to engineer for an increase in reduc-
tive amination activity have also lead to increased ketoreduction.
In summary, the data presented herein demonstrate that IRED 
sequence-activity relationships are highly substrate dependent, although 
many residues close to and within the active site are highly conserved 
between enzymes. The knowledge that an enzyme with cyclic imine 
natural substrates can also catalyze intermolecular reductive amination 
provides a new avenue for biocatalyst discovery, and sequence-structure 
analysis offers a way to limit the scope of saturation mutagenesis 
experiments, which is of benefit in directed evolution experiments 
where chromatographic analysis can become cost-limiting. There 
remains a strong need for reliable high-throughput screening methods, 
with the potential benefits from IRED engineering having been 
robustly demonstrated (29). In addition, the fact that direct keto-
reduction activity can be instilled in IREDs through point mutations 
supports earlier work, indicating that the chemoselectivity of dehy-
drogenases is tunable through mutagenesis (35). However, this type 
of promiscuity has implications in terms of other assays, since the 
activity of wild-type and mutant IREDs in reductive amination has 
frequently been measured using NADPH oxidation assays, in which 
imine reduction and ketoreduction are indistinguishable (2, 27, 36).

DH5 cells were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). 
CDX-901 glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) was purchased from 
Codexis (Redwood City, CA, USA), and GDH-101 was supplied by 
Johnson Matthey (Cambridge, UK).
Software and sequence-structure analysis
Protein and DNA sequences were selected and downloaded from 
the UniProt (31) and National Center for Biotechnology Information 
online databases (37). Plasmid and primer design were performed 
using SnapGene software (GSL Biotech, Chicago, USA). Phylogenetic 
trees were produced using the Clustal Omega online tool (38), and 
dendrograms for the presentation of screening data were produced 
using the iToL (Interactive Tree of Life) online tool (European 
Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany) (39). The 
proprietary SmartScaffold approach from Johnson Matthey was used 
for the sequence and structure analysis. The approach involves 
numerous steps, including advanced, multitemplate homology 
modeling, flexible docking, and a custom functionality (SLAP) that 
defines the extended active site through the study of steric clashes 
and contacts between the protein model and a conformational en-
semble of the best scoring docked poses. The homology modeling 
and docking use the Prime and Glide functionalities of Maestro 11.9 
software (Schrödinger, Cambridge, MA, USA) with default parameters.
Selection and cloning of putative IRED sequences
Putative IRED sequences were selected either by a BLAST with the 
sequence of AspRedAm (2) as a query, across the full database, or 
limited to mammalian, cyanobacterial, plant, or extremophile genomes 
or by a search of the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes 
(40) for proteins with >30% sequence identity to AspRedAm, or a 
bit-score of greater than 50, within the genomes of organisms in the 
laboratory culture collection. Where possible, these enzymes were 
cloned from live cultures, and where this was unsuccessful, the gene 
was instead purchased as a synthetic construct in a generic vector. 
Two more were cloned from purchased genomic DNA, but the rest 
of the putative IREDs for the panel were purchased from GeneArt 
(Regensburg, Germany) as DNA strings that were codon-optimized 
for E. coli using their GeneOptimizer online tool (41). These were 
subcloned directly into a cut pET28b(+) vector purchased from Novagen 
(Darmstadt, Germany), using NdeI and XhoI restriction sites by means 
of an In-Fusion HD Cloning kit (Takara Bio, Kusatsu, Japan) accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s protocol. The constructs were then trans-
formed into chemically competent E. coli BL21 (DE3) and DH5 and 
were also transferred to Prozomix Ltd. for production according to 
their internal protocols (24). Sequencing of the colonies resulting from 
subcloning into pET-28b(+) revealed several deviations from the expected 
sequences (see section S2.4), and in the case of one enzyme from our 
in-house culture collection, the resulting protein sequence showed 
significant divergence from that listed in the UniProt database (31), 
most likely due to cloning from a different Streptomyces rimosus strain. 
The enzymes that were successfully cloned were assigned codes from 
p-IR01 to p-IR90. Of the 80 previously uncharacterized putative IREDs, 
21 are of fungal origin. In addition to these, a further 22 IREDs from 
plants and 1 enzyme of mammalian origin were selected. The rest of 
the panel was made up of IREDs from a range of bacterial origins.
Expression and purification of IREDs
Single colonies of E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with the re-
quired plasmid were used to inoculate 5-ml precultures in LB medium 
supplemented with kanamycin (30 mg liter −1), which were grown 
overnight at 37°C and 250 rpm. For all IREDs except AspRedAm, 
which was produced as previously described (2), 2-liter baffled flasks 
containing 400 ml of LB medium were autoclaved and then supple-
mented with kanamycin (30 mg liter−1), before being inoculated with 
the overnight cultures. The cells were grown in a shaking incubator 
at 37°C and 250 rpm to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6 to 0.8, 
whereby protein expression was induced by addition of IPTG (0.1 mM). 
Cell growth was continued at 20°C and 250 rpm overnight. The cells 
were then harvested by centrifugation [4°C and 2831 relative cen-
trifugal field (rcf) for 20 min] and washed with potassium phos-
phate buffer [100 mM (pH 7.0)]. Wet cells were resuspended in 
500% (v/w) Tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane hydrochloride (Tris-
HCl) buffer [100 mM (pH 8.0)], and lysis was performed by ultra-
sonication (4°C for 20 min, 30-s pulse, 30-s off, repeat 20 times). The 
resulting suspension was centrifuged (39,191 rcf for 40 min), and 
the supernatant was used directly or flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen 
and either stored at −80°C or lyophilized and stored at −20°C 
until use.
Biocatalytic reduction of 1 with cell-free extract
To a pH-adjusted solution of d-glucose (10 mol, 20 mM) and NADP+ 
(0.25 mol, 0.5 mM) in tris-HCl buffer [100 mM (pH 8.0)] were 
added B. subtilis GDH cell-free extract (50  l) and IRED cell-free 
extract (2.0 mg, 4 g liter −1) from solutions (10 g liter −1) in tris-HCl 
buffer [100 mM (pH 8.0)]. Imine 1  (5  mol, 10 mM) was added 
from a 1 M stock solution in DMSO to give a total reaction volume 
of 500 l. Reactions were incubated at 30°C and 250 rpm for 24 hours, 
after which they were quenched by addition of 5 M NaOH (50  l) 
and extracted into tert-butyl methyl ether (2 × 500 l). The organic 
fractions were combined, dried over anhydrous MgSO 4, and ana-
lyzed for conversion by GC–flame-ionization detection (FID). The 
samples were subsequently derivatized by addition of triethylamine 
(5 l) and acetic anhydride (5  l), followed by incubation at 30°C 
and 250 rpm for 5 min. The reactions were quenched with 5 M NaOH 
(50 l), and the phases were separated. The organic phase was dried 
over anhydrous MgSO 4 and analyzed for enantiomeric excess by 
GC-FID. We estimate the limit of detection to be approximately 
0.05 mM, or 0.5% conversion/1% ee in 10 mM transformation, and 
the limit of quantification to be closer to 1 mM or 10% conversion/20% 
ee for a typical transformation, based on an SD of 5%.
Typical procedure for screening in biocatalytic reductive 
amination with cell-free extract
To pH-adjusted solutions of amine nucleophile (10 mol, 20 mM) 
in tris-HCl buffer [100 mM (pH 8.0)] in a 96-well plate were added 
d-glucose (50 mol, 50 mM) and NADP+ (0.25 mol, 0.5 mM) followed 
by GDH-101 cell-free extract (0.5 mg, 1.0 g liter −1) and IRED cell-
free extract (2.0 mg, 4 g liter −1) from solutions (10 g liter−1) in tris-
HCl buffer [100 mM (pH 8.0)]. The ketone substrate (5 mol, 10 mM) 
was added from a 1 M stock solution in DMSO to give a total reac-
tion volume of 500 l. Reactions were incubated at 30°C and 300 rpm 
for 24 hours, after which they were quenched by addition of 
1 M NaOH (300 l) and extracted into tert-butyl methyl ether (2 × 500 l) 
using a Hamilton MicroLab STAR liquid handling system. The 
combined organic phases were analyzed by GC-FID. Where deriva-
tization was required, triethylamine (5 l) and acetic anhydride (5 l) 
were added, and the samples were incubated at 30°C and 250 rpm 
for 5 min. The reactions were quenched with 1 M NaOH (300  l),

and the phases were separated. Where cosolvents or substrate 
concentrations above 10 mM were investigated, all substrates were 
added neat or from a pH-adjusted aqueous solution. For transfor-
mations with 100 mM ketone, the substrate was added neat to avoid 
increasing the final percentage of DMSO.
Biocatalytic reductive aminations with ArpDHII
To a pH-adjusted solution of amine nucleophile in tris-HCl buffer 
[100 mM (pH 9.0)] were added d-glucose (12.5 mol, 25 mM) and 
NADP+ (0.25 mol, 0.5 mM) followed by B. subtilis GDH cell-free 
extract (50 l) and purified ArpDHII (0.5 mg, 1 g liter−1) from solu-
tions (10 g liter−1) in tris-HCl buffer [100 mM (pH 9.0)]. The ketone 
or aldehyde substrate (2.5 mol, 5 mM) was added from a 1 M stock 
solution in DMSO to give a total reaction volume of 500  l. Reac-
tions were incubated at 30°C and 250 rpm for 24 hours, after which 
they were quenched by addition of 5 M NaOH (50 l) and extracted 
into tert-butyl methyl ether (2 × 500 l). The combined organic phases 
were dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and analyzed by GC-FID.
Biocatalytic reductive aminations with other purified IREDs 
and variants
To a solution of d-glucose (20 mol, 20 mM) and NADP+ (0.5 mol, 
0.5 mM) in tris-HCl buffer [100 mM (pH 8.0)] were added B. subtilis 
GDH cell-free extract (100 l) and purified IRED (1 mg, 1 g liter−1) 
from a solution (10 g liter −1) in potassium phosphate (KP i) buffer 
[100 mM (pH 8.0)]. Cyclohexanone (10 mol, 10 mM) and aniline 
(20 mol, 20 mM) were added from 1 M stock solutions in DMSO 
to give a total reaction volume of 1 ml. Reactions were incubated at 
30°C and 250 rpm, with 200-l aliquots taken at defined time inter-
vals, quenched by addition of 5 M NaOH (50 l), and extracted into 
tert-butyl methyl ether (2 × 200  l). The combined organic phases 
were dried over anhydrous MgSO4 and analyzed by GC-FID.
