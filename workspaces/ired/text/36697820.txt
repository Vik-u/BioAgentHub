Since imine reductases (IREDs) were reported to catalyze the reductive amination reactions,
they became particularly attractive for producing chiral amines. Though diverse ketones and
aldehydes have been proved to be excellent substrates of IREDs, bulky amines have been
rarely transformed. Here we report the usage of an Increasing-Molecule-Volume-Screening
to identify a group of IREDs (IR-G02, 21, and 35) competent for accepting bulky amine
substrates. IR-G02 shows an excellent substrate scope, which is applied to synthesize over
135 amine molecules as well as a range of APIs’ substructures. The crystal structure of IR-
G02 reveals the determinants for altering the substrate preference. Finally, we demonstrate a
gram-scale synthesis of an analogue of the API sensiparvia a kinetic resolution approach,
which displays ee >99%, total turnover numbers of up to 2087, and space time yield up to
18.10 g L
−1 d−1.

iocatalysis is an attractive approach for the synthesis of
chiral amines, which constitute 40% of current pharma-
ceuticals approved by the FDA1. The employed biocatalysts
include IREDs, lipases, transaminases, ammonia dehydrogenases,
and monoamine oxidases
2,3. Since IREDs were discovered in
20104, they have attracted the catalytic research community for
their potential application in the asymmetric synthesis of chiral
amines5,6. Recently, reductive aminases are identiﬁed as a sub-
family of IREDs by Turner and co-workers7, which could create
diverse chiral amines through reductive aminations of carbonyl
and amine donors provided in equal stoichiometric ratio
(Fig. 1a)7. Based on the broad substrate scope, IREDs have been
engineered for industrial production of LSD1 inhibitor
GSK2879552 and JAK1 inhibitor abrocitinib 8,9. Thus, IREDs
become an efﬁcient and economical way to rapidly construct
chiral amine products8,10–17.
However, the industrial application of IREDs is mainly
restricted by limited substrate scope, especially low activities
towards bulky amines18. For example, the ﬁrst characterized
AspRedAm showed excellent activities towards small amines,
such as cyclopropylamine, propargylamine, and allylamine, but
exhibited poor activities towards large and sterically hindered
amines7,18. Speciﬁcally, for piperidine, benzylamine, and aniline,
AspRedAm retained only around 10% activity compared to pro-
pargylamine when they were reacting with the active carbonyl
donor cyclohexanone (Fig. 1b)7. Furthermore, AspRedAm dis-
played no activity towards those amines reacting with the more
challenging carbonyl donor 4-phenyl-2-butanone 7. However,
only a few IREDs showed good transforming activities when
using benzylamine as amine donor in the previous studies13,15.
Due to the increasing desire for biocatalysts for the synthesis of
APIs, designing a comprehensive screening to identify IREDs
favoring bulky amines is of great practical signiﬁcance.
As more and more IREDs are reported, screening of the pro-
mising enzyme for subsequent engineering and industrial appli-
cation is a laborious job. In this study, a rapid protocol of
Increasing-Molecule-Volume-Screening was constructed. Using
Increasing-Molecule-Volume-Screening, we identi ﬁed three
IREDs with the preference towards bulky amine substrates. We
further evaluated their abilities for the synthesis of APIs, together
with their application to the gram-scale synthesis of a bulkyN-
alkylated benzylamine. The X-ray crystallography provides
insight into the structural basis of the substrate preference. This
study expands and deepens the research aimed at applying IREDs
for asymmetric reductive amination reactions.
Results and discussion
Sequence diversity of IREDs. To investigate the preference of
IREDs in reductive amination towards different amine substrates,
AspRedAm and 85 reported IREDs in our lab were selected
(Supplementary Fig. 1)19. All 86 IREDs already showed excellent
activities towards certain substrates7,13,15,17,20, which made them
being a good starting point for this study. Previous studies of
those enzymes mainly focused on small amines
8,10–17, including
methylamine, dimethylamine, cyclopropylamine, butylamine,
isopropylamine, allylamine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, and pro-
pargylamine, etc. Screenings were also performed towards
arylamines7,15,18. For instance, IR-G02, IR-G03, IR-G04, IR-G05,
and IR-G08, showed excellent (>90%) conversions towards ary-
lamines, including benzylamine, aniline, and 3-aminopyridine14.
However, more bulky amines have rarely been examined.
Identifying IREDs for bulky amines. All 86 IREDs were suc-
cessfully obtained by expressing their genes inE. coliBL21(DE3).
Subsequently, their catalytic potential toward bulky amines was
explored by using Increasing-Molecule-Volume-Screening. It is a
rapid protocol to screen the preferable substrate size of IREDs by
synthesizing a group of targeted products with increasing volumes.
We targeted ﬁve structures (Fig.2): i) 1A , 1B,a n d1C could be
synthesized from the active carbonyl donor cyclohexanone1 with
increasingly-bulkier amines, cyclopropylamine A, thiophene-2-
ethylamine B, and tryptamineC, respectively; ii)2C and 3C could
be synthesized from the amineC with the non-active and bulkier

carbonyls, adamantanone2 and 5-methoxy-2-tetralone3,r e s p e c -
tively. An equimolar ration of carbonyl and amine were used for all
reactions (Supplementary Method 1). Conversions have been
determined by comparison of the peak areas of UV absorption or
extract ions of amine products with standard amins using HPLC or
LC-MS (Supplementary Method 2 and Supplementary Data 3).
In the reductive aminations of1 with A, B, andC, the number
of enzyme hits (conv. >20%) has fallen signiﬁcantly with the
addition of bulkier amines. As shown in Fig.2, the number of
enzyme hits for1A , 1B, and1C were 78, 39, and 13, respectively
(Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). Similarly,AspRedAm gave a
>90% conversion for1 with A, however, only 19% conversion and
<5% conversion was observed for 1 with B and with C,
respectively. These results conﬁrmed the low tolerance of IREDs
for bulky amines. Further analysis indicated only 9 and 5 enzyme
hits were observed for2C and 3C , respectively, while the rest of
the enzymes exhibited weak or no measurable activities.
The activities of most enzymes are negatively correlated with the
volumes of targeting molecules,such as IR-G08, IR-G13, and IR-G39,
which were active for1A , 1B,a n d1C , but lost activities for2C and
3C (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). Only a few untypical
examples, such as IR-G11 and IR-G49, showed better activities
towards certain targets with larger volumes. Thus, the Increasing-
Molecule-Volume-Screening could rapidly evaluate the tolerance of
IREDs towards bulky substrates. Finally, only three IREDs were
obtained: IR-G02, 21, and 35. Theywere constantly active for all
reactions and all displayed >50% conversions for1, 2,a n d3 with C.
Phylogenetic and bioinformatic analysis suggested the IREDs IR-
G02 (Streptomyces albidoﬂavus), IR-21 (Saccharothrix espanaensis),
and IR-35 (Allokutzneria albata) were all derived from actinomy-
cetes and belonged to the same evolutionary branch with sequence
identity ranging from 40 to 44% (Supplementary Fig. 2). Overall,
the IREDs from bacteria and fungi showed better activities towards
bulky aminesB and C (Fig. 2), compared to those from plants and
humans. Based on the initial results, the IREDs (IR-G02, 21, and
35) were further evaluated for the synthesis of APIs against bulky
carbonyls and amines.
Evaluating enzymatic synthesis of APIs using IREDs
Reactions of 4-phenyl-2-butanone with bulky amines. 4-phenyl-2-
butanamines are often found in APIs, such as the antihyperten-
sion agent dilevalol
21 in Fig. 3a. IR-G02 exhibited high speciﬁc
activity for4 with dopamineD (53% conversion), which harbors
a hydroxyl group that reduces the compatibility of substrates with
IREDs, while the activities of IR-G21 and IR-G35 were sig-
niﬁcantly lower with the conversions below 5%. Bulkier aminesB
and E were also accepted as reacting partners with 4, with
moderate to high conversions.
Reactions of tetralone with bulky amines . Tetralone-derived
amines are frequently found in APIs, such rotigotine (Fig. 3b
and Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4), an agent for the treatment of
Parkinson’s disease and restless syndrome22. Turner and cow-
orkers have studied synthesis of rotigotine by IREDs-catalyzed
reductive aminations, using 5-methoxy-2-tetralone as ketone
donor and n-propylamine or thiophene-2-ethylamine as amine
donor with stereoselectivities up to 92% ( S) and 99% ( S)

corresponding secondary amine. The black color scale in each tile is representative of the number of hits generated through the screening with the given
substrate. The standard assay mixture (50μL) contained 5.0 mM ketone, 5.0 mM amine, 1.0 mM NADP+, GDH (0.2 mg ml−1), D-glucose (30 mM),
100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and 1 mg mL−1 IREDs. The conversion of reductive amination products was determined by comparison with
UV-Vis absorptions of synthesized standard reference materials. The enzymes (IR-G02, 21, and 35) with red triangle block are potent IREDs.

respectively. In this study, the speciﬁc activities of IR-G02, 21,
and 35 were measured towards3 with B, and low to moderate
conversions (6–22%) were obtained. Interestingly, when 3 was
incubated with the larger amineC, signiﬁcantly higher conver-
sions could be observed, and particularly, IR-G21 and IR-G35 all
give >90% conversions, highlighting the contribution of the
amine partner to the catalytic activities.
Reactions to access bulky N-alkylated benzylamines. N-alkylated
benzylamines are also frequently found in APIs, such as sensipar
(Fig. 3c and Supplementary Fig. 5), a treatment for secondary
hyperparathyroidism23. Given aromatic conjugated ketones being
challenged substrates for IREDs20,24, we applied kinetic resolution to
synthesize bulkyN-alkylated benzylamines. 3-phenylpropionaldehyde
5 and racemic 1-(1-Naphthyl)ethylamineF were used for reductive
amination, and >44% conversions were observed for IR-G02 and IR-
G35 with excellent kinetic resolution >99% (S) and >83% (S),
respectively.
Reactions with bulky tryptamine and 5-methoxytryptamine .
Tryptamine C and 5-methoxytryptamineG are building blocks for
clinically important 5-HT agonists and therapeutics25,s u c ha st h e

including 1, 5, benzaldehyde 6, and 2-phenylacetaldehyde 7.I n
many cases, reactions afforded moderate to excellent conversions.
Of signiﬁcance, IRG-02 exerts high conversions (>55%) in all
reactions.
Reactions with polycyclic adamantine derivatives. We used the
adamantine derivatives to probe the preference of IR-G02, 21,
and 35 towards polycyclic structures. 2-adamantanone 2 and
memantine H have not been reported to be accepted by IREDs,
which could be used to synthesize agents for viral infections and
Alzheimer’s disease, such as bromantane 26 in Fig. 3e. The
synthesis of 2C , 2D, and 6H using IR-G02 gave conversions of
54%, 41%, and >99%, respectively. IR-G35 also showed high
conversion (79%) for the reductive amination of2 and D. Both2
and H could be well transformed, which represents an important
extension of the substrate scope of IREDs.
Reactions with 3,3-diphenylpropylamine. We were further inter-
ested in the reductive aminations towards more challenging
substrates, for instance, 3,3-diphenylpropylamineI. IR-G02 gave
61 and 15% conversions for the reductive aminations ofL with
two chain aldehydes (8 and 9), while IR-G35 showed 56 and 28%
conversions for those two reductive aminations (Fig.3f).
Overall, moderate (20–60%) or high conversions (>60%) were
observed for most reactions in Fig.3, and all bulky amines ofB-I
could be well transformed. IR-G02 showed unusually broad
substrate tolerance with >50% conversions for 11 products in
Fig. 3. Thus, we further expanded the test scope for IR-G02 with a
variety of ﬁrst-time-tested substrates (Supplementary Figs. 6 and
7). Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3
displays all reactions performed with an equimolar ratio of
carbonyls and amines, using the mass-ion abundance of the
corresponded products (determined by LC-MS), which indicates
i) 14 ﬁrst-time-tested bulky amines (B–O) could be efﬁciently
transformed with certain carbonyl donors; ii) over 135 reductive-
amination products could be synthesized with considerable
conversions (each of their ion abundances is more than
5×1 0
6); iii) aliphatic aldehydes, such as 5, 6, 9, and 18, are
among the most active carbonyl donors. Overall, this work
signiﬁcantly expanded the substrate scope of IREDs.
Structural studies of IR-G02. To investigate the structural basis
for observed prominent activities of IR-G02, the apo-structure
(PDB ID: 7XE8) and NADP+ complex of IR-G02 (PDB ID:
7XR5) were obtained (Figs.4a and5a). However, several attempts
to crystallize the ternary complex with NADP+ and (1-methyl-3,
4-dihydroisoquinoline 24), 5,o r F were unsuccessful. This is
consistent with the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) results
showing no signiﬁcant reaction heat or saturation curve detected
for interactions between IR-G02 and the substrates above (Sup-
plementary Fig. 9). The apo- structure of IR-G02 shared the
similar dimeric structure ofAspRedAm7. It is a dimer with the
active site forms at the interface (Fig.4a). Each of the monomers
was made up of anN-terminal Rossman domain and aC-term-
inal helical bundle connected by a long inter-domain α-helix.
Except for the NADPH binding site, the pocket cavity of IR-G02
showed a strong negative electrostatic surface potential (Fig.5a),
which may favor the entry of positively charged amine donors
and imine intermediate27, and contribute to its high substrate
promiscuity.
Previous reports described three IREDs thatAoIRED, BcIRED
and AspRedAm switching to a closed conformation upon cofactor
binding, characterized by a relative angle-closure between theN-
terminal Rossmann and the C-terminal helical domain 7,28,29,
while such movements were not found in IR-G02-NADP +
complex. Superimposition of apo-IR-G02 and IR-G02-NADP+
complex shows an overall rmsd of 2.665 Å. There are substantial
changes in the Rossman fold: most secondary structures shift with
the binding of NADP+, and the side chain of T102ﬂips with its
hydroxy group facing the NADP+ and forming a hydrogen bond
with the ribose moiety of NADP+. The homologous site of the
residue S260 in IR-G36 is occupied by A242 in IR-G02 and no
interaction is found between the loop 234–244 and NADP+,
indicating IR-G02 is “wide” type IRED which possesses relative
wide catalytic cavity for bulky-substrate entry and product
release19.
IR-G02 showed a 37% sequence identity with AspRedAm.
Cavity-volume calculation using CASTp30 suggested the cavity
volume of IR-G02-NADP+ (Supplementary Method 3) complex
is 1.9-fold of that ofAspRedAm (Supplementary Fig. 10), which
also rationalizes its better substrate tolerance31–38. This is also
consistent with our hypothesis that IREDs obtained through the
increasing-target-volume screening may possess large substrate-
binding pockets.
Site-directed mutagenesis of IR-G02. In order to investigate the
key residues in the active site, and the residues associated with the
bulky substrate tolerance, site-directed mutagenesis was per-
formed with 14 selected residues in the active site (Fig.4a). Three
residues Y177, D169, and N93 have been proposed as the catalytic
triad inAspRedAm39. The homologous site of W187 was Y177 in
AspRedAm, which was proposed to be essential for protonation
and anchoring of the carbonyls39. The weak protic W187 is
incapable of being a proton shuttle, and a nearby protonic resi-
due, most likely H247 could take the place of W187. Analysis of
the IR-G02-NADP
+ complex suggested the side chain of H247 is
positioned approximately 11.9 Å from the NADPH C4 atom that
delivers and accepts hydride (Fig.4b and Supplementary Table 4),
whereas the distance from W187 to NADPH C4 atom is 12.8 Å.
The increased Km values of mutants W187A and H247A for
ketone 1 support the possible roles of two residues in ketone
binding (Fig. 4c). Meanwhile, mutants W187A and H247A
showed signiﬁcant decreases in conversions for all reductive
aminations (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 4).
The residue D179, which occupies the position equivalent to
D169 in AspRedAm, is proposed to be responsible for
deprotonating the amine substrate39. The mutant D179A shows
no apparent change in the imine reduction activity but a
signiﬁcant decrease in all reductive amination conversions
(13–75%) and higher Km values for ketone 1, suggestive of a
signiﬁcant role in reductive amination.
The homologue of T102 has been reported to be the amine
donor binding and cofactor sites39,40. Notably, the mutant T102A
showed signiﬁcantly decreased conversions toward all substrates
(Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 4). Protein structure analysis
suggested that T102 was located at the Rossmann fold domain
with its side chain approximately 2.8–3.0 Å from the 2′ and 3′-
ribose hydroxyls of NADPH, which is responsible for recognizing
and binding NADPH (Fig.5b). Indeed, ITC results suggested that
T102A showed a 43% decrease in the afﬁnity to NADPH (Kd
values: 2.69E4 M −1 (Wild Type); 1.88E5 M −1 (T102A);
Supplementary Fig. 11).
Interestingly, 10 and 92% improvements were observed for
D240A toward the synthesis of 2C and 3C (Fig. 4b and
Supplementary Table 4), respectively. Tunnel analysis using
Caver41 suggested D241 is located at theﬂexible loop A234-L244
on the top of the active site, which forms a bottleneck (about
3.6 Å) imposing steric constraints for the entrance of the bulky
substrates (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 12). The structure of
mutant D241A has been modeled, and indeed, the bottleneck was

suggested to be improved to 4.0 Å (Fig.5d), which is consistent
with our recent results that the catalytic ef ﬁciency can be
improved by expanding the side opening19.
M217 is located on the side opening of the substrate tunnel,
which may affect the substrate entrance. Mutant M217A
displayed high activities for the imine reduction of 24 or the
synthesis of 1A and 1B, but almost lost the activities for the
synthesis of bulky 1C , 2C , and 3C with 93–96% decreases of
conversions (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 4), suggesting a
role of M217 in bulky substrates tolerance. The mutations of
three hydrophobic residues L183, M186, and L190 on the longα-
helix to alanine showed different reductions of activities towards
substrates (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 4). Especially, the
activities of mutant L183A showed considerable decreases for all
reactions, suggesting that the residue L183 located on the inter-
domain α-helix may provide the necessary hydrophobic force or
steric hindrance to ensure the catalytic conformation of the
substrate in the active pocket. Ala scanning mutagenesis on the
rest of the residues in the active site gave no obvious differences
in all activities.
Overall, our work revealed a similar reductive-amination
mechanism of IR-G02 toAspRedAm, and the intensely negative
potential of the substrate-binding site and relative wide catalytic
cavity may contribute to the good bulky amine compatibility in
IR-G02.
Preparative-scale synthesis of N-alkylated benzylamine via
kinetic resolution. To demonstrate the practical utility of IR-
G02, we set up to preparative scale synthesis of N-alkylated
benzylamine (S)-5F, which is an analogue of sensipar. The pH
optimum of IR-G02 was found to be 7.0, and the temperature
optimum was 30 °C (Supplementary Table 5). The unfolding
nature was studied by recording CD222 at different temperatures
(20–80 °C), which indicated the melting temperature of IR-G 02
was found to be 52 °C with 8 degrees higher than that of
AspRedAm (Supplementary Fig. 13) 10. The concentration of
ketone, the number of amine equivalents, and the enzyme loading
were also comprehensively studied. Kinetic parameters were
determined with aKm value of 6.464 mM,Kcat value of 0.606 s−1,
and Kcat/Km value of 0.094 s−1 mM−1. Good conversion (>48%)
could be achieved using an equimolar ratio of 20 mM5 and
racemic F with 0.15 mg mL−1 IR-G02. Therefore, a preparative
scale reaction (250 mL reaction volume) was performed using5
(670.85 mg, 5 mmol) and equal amineF (856.20 mg, 5 mmol)
(Supplementary Method 4 and Fig. 14), which were converted
into (S)-5F with high enantioselectivity (>99% ee) and 48%
conversion. Eventually, (S)-5F was produced in 39% isolated
yield, with total turnover numbers (TTNs) up to 2087, and space
time yield (STY) up to 18.10 g L−1 d−1.
Conclusion
In addition to the wider tunnel and negative potential of the
enzyme cavity highlighted here, the characteristics of the sub-
strates include polarity, thepKa of the amine donors, and steric
hindrance around the reacting amine or carbonyl groups, etc.,
which could also affect the activities of IREDs. Thus, various
IREDs with dedicated substrate preferences and complementary
enantioselectivities towards diverse amine donors are desired, but
not yet reported. The ones presented here represent an ideal
starting point to further broaden the chemist’s biocatalyst toolbox
for chiral amine synthesis. Also, IR-G02, 21, and 35 have been
evaluated for the synthesis of various APIs. For example, IR-G35
showed moderate enantioselectivity (>77%) in the synthesis of a
rotigotine substructure. Future protein engineering will be the
method of choice to generate more efﬁcient and stereospeciﬁc
mutants of IR-G02, 21, and 35.
The IREDs identi ﬁed here by the Increasing-Molecule-
Volume-Screening showed good tolerance of 14ﬁrst-time-tested
bulky amines. IR-G02 exhibits an excellent substrate scope that
enables it to synthesize more than 135 secondary and tertiary
amines with considerable conversions. Finally, a gram-scale and
highly-enantioselective synthesis (>99%) of sensipar analogue (S)-
5F was achieved with IR-G02 through the kinetic resolution
approach, by using only a stoichiometric amount of bulky amine
1-(1-Naphthyl)ethylamine.
In summary, the broad tolerance to bulky amines of IREDs
with low stoichiometry provides a biological route to access
medicinal chiral amines. Our work will stimulate further research,
as many questions are still open, including how to further engi-
neer IR-G02, 21, and 35 for favoring polar and hindered sub-
strates. Due to the hydrophobic nature of the active site in
IREDs7,18, characterized IREDs tend to accept small and hydro-
phobic substrates7,18. Thus, one challenge regarding the industrial
application of IREDs is the low preference toward polar sub-
strates, including carboxylic-acid or hydroxyl-substituted ones.
IR-G02 shows activities towardsD, O, M, and22, which are only
cases for the enzyme-catalyzed reductive aminations towards
substrates harboring hydroxyl groups to the best of our knowl-
edge. Hence, more efforts for identifying and engineering IREDs
with substrate preference toward bulky substrates remains to
be done.
Methods
General. LC-MS analysis was performed on the AGILENT-1100HPLC/G1946D
MSD (Agilent Technologies Inc., California, USA) system using C18 analytical
column (Ultimate XB-C18, 2.1 × 100 mm, 3μm). Chiral HPLC analysis was per-
formed on Shimadzu LC-2030C 3D plus (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) or Waters 2695
(Waters, Milford, USA) using chiral analytical columns (CHIRALPAK IA/OD-H/
AY-H, 4.6 × 250 mm, 5μm). 1D and 2D NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker
Avance 500 MHz spectrometer. Size-exclusion chromatography was carried out
with Sephadex LH-20 column (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). Column chro-
matography was performed on silica gel (200–300 mesh, Qingdao Marine Ltd.,
Qingdao, China). Commercially available chemicals and reagents were purchased
from Meryer (Shanghai, China), Macklin (Shanghai, China), 3AChem (Shanghai,
China), Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, Dorset, UK), or Alfa Aesar (Karlsruhe, Germany)
unless stated otherwise. HPLC solvents were obtained from Thermo Fisher Sci-
entiﬁc (Waltham, Massachusetts, USA).
Reductive amination procedure for the preparation of amines. A dry methanol
(10 mL) solution of the ketone or aldehyde (2.0 mmol), the corresponding amine
(3.0 mmol), and acetic acid (300μL) under an N
2 atm was stirred for 1.5 h at r.t.
The reaction was placed in an ice-H2O bath and sodium cyanoborohydride
(0.377 g, 6.0 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture gradually warmed to r.t. and
stirred overnight. The reaction progress was monitored by TLC and following
completion was quenched with sat. NaHCO3 solution (10 mL) and stirred for an
additional 30 min. The mixture was extracted with EtOAc (3 × 10 mL) and the
combined organic phase dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced
pressure. Column chromatography on silica affords the corresponding racemic
amine. The NMR data are provided in Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary
Data 4.
Expression and puriﬁcation of IREDs. The plasmids containing the genes for target
enzymes were used to transformE. coliBL21(DE3) competent cells for gene
expression. Pre-cultures were grown in LB-medium (10 mL) containing 30 µg mL−1
kanamycin for 12 h at 37 °C with shaking at 220 r.p.m. 1 L volume cultures were
inoculated with the pre-culture (10 mL) and incubated at 37 °C, with shaking at
220 r.p.m. until an OD600 of 0.6~0.8 was reached. Gene expression was induced by the
addition of IPTG (0.2 mM) and shaking was continued overnight at 16 °C with
shaking at 160 r.p.m. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 5000 g for
30 min and resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.5, containing 300 mM NaCl.
Cells were disrupted by ultrasonication for 10 min, 5 s on, 9 s off cycles, and the
suspension was centrifuged at 50,000 g for 30 min to yield a clear lysate.
The N-terminal His-tagged proteins were puriﬁed using the Ni-NTA column.
In each case, the lysate was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA column,
followed by washing with a load buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 40 mM

imidazole pH 7.5). The bound protein was eluted with buffer containing 250 mM
imidazole. Proteins were concentrated and used for biotransformation reactions.
Protein puriﬁcation and crystallisation. The amino acid and DNA sequences are
available in Supplementary Note 2. The N-terminal His6-tagged proteins were
puriﬁed using Ni-NTA column, followed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC)
(Supplementary Fig. 15). In each case, the lysate was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated
Ni-NTA column, followed by washing with a load buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl,
300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole pH 7.5). The bound protein was eluted using a
linear gradient with buffer containing 60~250 mM imidazole. IR-G02 fractions
were pooled, concentrated, and loaded onto a GL 10/300 Superdex 200 gelﬁltration
column pre-equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl pH 7.5 buffer. The
concentrated protein sample after gelﬁltration was used for crystallization
screening.
IR-G02 was crystallized by the sitting-drop vapour diffusion method at 18 °C
with 1μL protein solution mixed with 1μL reservoir buffer. High-quality crystals
(Supplementary Fig. 15) of IR-G02 grew in the buffer containing 0.2 M ammonium
acetate, 0.1 M Bis-Tris 5.5, 25 % w/v PEG 3350 with a protein concentration of
20 mg ml
−1.
IR-G02-NADP+ complex was also crystallized by the sitting-drop vapour
diffusion method at 18 °C with 1μL protein solution mixed with 1μL reservoir
buffer. High-quality crystals (Supplementary Fig. 15) of IR-G02-NADP+ complex
grew in the buffer containing 0.1 M Bis-Tris pH 7.5, 25% PEG 4000 and 0.25 M
NaCl with a protein concentration of 20 mg ml−1 which was incubation with
NADP+ (10 eq) for 2 h.
Diffraction data were collected with cryoprotected (in a reservoir solution
containing 20% [v/v] glycerol) crystals at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation
Facility beamline BL17U. All the datasets were processed with XDS and aimless.
The structure of IR-G02 was determined by the molecular replacement method in
Phenix. The atomic model was completed with Coot and reﬁned with Phenix.reﬁne
in Phenix, and the stereochemical quality of theﬁnal model was assessed with
Molprobity. Data collection, processing and reﬁnement statistics are summarized
in Supplementary Table 6.
Michaelis-Menten kinetic analysis. The kinetics measurements of puriﬁed wild
type and variants of IR-G02 for substrates were performed at 30 °C in potassium
phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.0) at various concentration ranges of ketones
(0.1–50 mM). Kinetic constants were determined through non-linear regression
based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics using GraphPad Prism7 software.
Isothermal titration calorimetry. ITC experiments were performed in a Microcal
ITC200 microcalorimeter at 25 °C in 100 mM PBS buffer (pH 7.4). Wild type,
variant T102A of IR-G02 and the ligands (NADPH, NADP
+, 1-(1-naphthyl)
ethylamine, 3-phenylpropionaldehyde, and 1-methyl-3, 4-dihydroisoquinoline)
were dialyzed into the PBS buffer containing 2% DMSO. All experiments were
performed with proteins (wild type or variant T102A of IR-G02) in the micro-
calorimeter cell at 40μM concentration, and ligands in the syringe at 600μM
concentration. The titrations (total 40 min) consisted of a total of 20 injections,
spaced 120 s apart. Data were analyzed in ORIGIN using a one-site binding model
with ﬁxed n = 1 per B subunit (theﬁxed-parameter was required to achieve con-
vergence of theﬁt).
Thermal denaturation studies. CD thermal unfolding measurements were per-
formed using a Jasco J810 CD Spectrophotometerﬁtted with a computer-controlled
Peltier temperature control unit, using protein solutions at 0.25 mg mL
−1 in 100 mM
NaPi pH 7.0 containing 1 mM NADPH cofactor. The protein solution was heated
through a 5 °C ramp with a 5 min relaxation time between the recording of CD
spectra at different temperatures from 20 to 80 °C. The unfolding curves were built by
using the CD signal at 220 nm to obtain melting temperature values.
