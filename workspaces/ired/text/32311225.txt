Systematic Evaluation of Imine-Reducing Enzymes:
Common Principles in Imine Reductases, β-Hydroxy Acid
Dehydrogenases, and Short-Chain Dehydrogenases/
Reductases

[a]
The enzymatic, asymmetric reduction of imines is catalyzed by
imine reductases (IREDs), members of the short-chain dehydro-
genase/reductase (SDR) family, and β-hydroxy acid dehydrogen-
ase (βHAD) variants. Systematic evaluation of the structures and
substrate-binding sites of the three enzyme families has
revealed four common principles for imine reduction: structur-
ally conserved cofactor-binding domains; tyrosine, aspartate, or
glutamate as proton donor; at least four characteristic flanking
residues that adapt the donor’s pK
a
and polarize the substrate;
and a negative electrostatic potential in the substrate-binding
site to stabilize the transition state. As additional catalytically
relevant positions, we propose alternative proton donors in
IREDs and βHADs as well as proton relays in IREDs, βHADs, and
SDRs. The functional role of flanking residues was experimen-
tally confirmed by alanine scanning of the imine-reducing SDR
from Zephyranthes treatiae. Mutating the “gatekeeping” phenyl-
alanine at standard position 200 resulted in a tenfold increase
in imine-reducing activity.
Introduction
Chiral secondary amines are important building blocks for a
broad range of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and other
specialty chemicals. Two promising biocatalytic routes are the
reductive amination of ketones by reductive aminases (RedAms)
or by amine dehydrogenases, and the asymmetric reduction of
imines catalyzed by imine reductases (IREDs).
[1]
Previously, a
moderate sequence similarity and a high structural similarity
between IREDs and β-hydroxy acid dehydrogenases (βHADs)
were uncovered.
[2]
In both families, the monomers consist of an
N-terminal NADPH-binding Rossmann-like domain
[3]
(domain
3.40.50.720 in the CATH database)
[4]
and a C-terminal helical
domain. However, the active dimers are formed by domain
swapping, with a long α8 helix in IREDs and a split α8 helix in
βHADs.
[5]
As a result, the substrate-binding sites in IREDs consist
of amino acids from different monomers, whereas they are built
by the two domains of a single monomer in βHADs.
[2]
The two
enzyme families also show an overlap of catalytic activities:
IREDs from Streptosporangium roseumyy (R-IRED-Sr) and Paeni-
bacillus elgii not only catalyze the asymmetric reduction of
imines, but also of the activated keto substrate 2,2,2-
trifluoroacetophenone.
[6]
Conversely, the glyoxylate reductase
from Arabidopsis thaliana is known to catalyze the reduction of
different cyclic imine compounds.
[7]
The similarity of the
catalytic sites of IREDs and βHADs is supported by the
observation that the exchange of a single amino acid in
glyoxylate reductase from A. thaliana (sc-βHAD-At; K170D or
K170F), γ-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase from Geobacter met-
allireducens (sc-βHAD-Gm; K171D), and 6-phosphogluconate
dehydrogenase from Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris strain
MG1363 (lc-βHAD-Ll; K184D) resulted in a significant decrease
in the keto acid reduction activity and a further increase in the
imine reduction activity. This increase was less striking for the
βHAD K171D from G. metallireducens.
[7]
Short-chain dehydro-
genases/reductases (SDRs) form a large protein family with high
structural and functional divergence.
[8]
They consist of a
conserved N-terminal NAD(P)H-binding Rossmann-like domain
and a variable, substrate specificity determining C-terminal
region. Based on highly conserved sequence motifs, SDRs are
classified into six subfamilies (classical, extended, intermediate,
divergent, complex, and atypical SDRs).
[9–15]
In addition to their
catalytic activity toward carbonyl groups, some SDRs also show
a moderate imine-reducing activity. Noroxomaritidine reductase
from Narcissus pseudonarcissus (SDR-Np) catalyzes as a physio-
logical reaction the reduction of the enone moiety in the plant
alkaloid noroxomaritidine, but also shows a promiscuous
catalytic activity toward the precursor imine norcraugsodine.
[16]
Furthermore, SDR-Np and a sequence-homologous SDR from
Zephyranthes treatiae (SDR-Zt) display catalytic activity toward
different imine compounds.
[17]
Additionally, commercial glucose
dehydrogenases are known to enantioselectively reduce bicyclic
iminium compounds.
[18]
Despite their promiscuous imine-reduc-
ing activity, these members of the SDR family have no
significant global sequence similarity to IREDs.

catalytic mechanism of IREDs is not completely understood,
[20]
it
is assumed that protonation of the imine occurs in the catalytic
site.
[21]
The resulting iminium is then reduced by a hydride
transferred from NAD(P)H.
[22]
Two superfamilies have been
distinguished: the R- and the S-selective IREDs. They differ in
their catalytic machinery with a conserved aspartic acid or a
tyrosine, respectively, as proton donor.
[23]
However, as the
orientation of the substrate depends critically on its structure,
R- and S-selective imine reductases convert some imines into S
and R amines, respectively.
[20,24]
Therefore, IREDs with aspartate
or glutamate as donor were assigned as D-type, with tyrosine as
Y-type.
[21]
The catalytic mechanism of βHADs is well understood.
The reduction of the C = O group is initiated via protonation by a
conserved lysine as proton donor, followed by hydride transfer
from NADPH.
[25]
Their catalytic mechanism is similar to the
extensively studied mechanism of classical SDRs, which is
mediated by a conserved catalytic triad or tetrad Lys-Tyr-(Asn)-
Ser. The tyrosine serves as a proton donor, and its pK
a
is
adjusted by interaction with the catalytic lysine. A water
molecule can be bound between the catalytic lysine and the
optional asparagine contributing to the proton relay system.
[12]
The polarization of the substrate’s carbonyl group is mediated
by the catalytic serine.
[12]
All three enzyme families (βHADs,
SDRs, IREDs) show conformational changes upon cofactor and
substrate binding. For the IRED from Amycolatopsis orientalis (R-
IRED-Ao), three different conformations have been observed:
the open apo form, the closed NADPH complex, and a complex
with cofactor and product. In the closed complex, the volume
of the substrate-binding site considerably decreased.
[24]
A
comparable mechanism of induced fit has also been observed
for βHADs and SDRs.
[16,26,27]
Although sequence-based classifica-
tions into distinct families provide a powerful tool, rigorous
functional classification approaches could bias the selection of
engineering templates. Despite of the separate family affiliation,
we hypothesized the existence of common principles for imine-
reducing enzymes.
Results
Due to the difference in length of sc-βHAD-At and lc-βHAD-Ll,
the relative orientation of the Rossmann-like domains of lc-
βHAD-Ll is twisted by 45 ° , and the dimerization is mediated by
different helical regions (Figure S4B, C in the Supporting
Information). In the dimeric SDR-Bv, in the absence of a C-
terminal helical domain the contact is mediated by the two
long helices of the Rossmann-like domain of each monomer
(Figure S4D). In the tetrameric SDR-Np, two of these dimers
associate along the axis of the β-sheets (Figure S5). The
Rossmann-like domains of R-IRED-Sr, R-IRED-Ao, βHAD-At,
βHAD-Ll, SDR-Bv, and SDR-Np were superimposed (Figure S6),
which revealed a similar binding conformation of NADPH
(Figure S7) and a similar location of the NADPH-binding
residues in the structurally conserved Rossmann fold (β-strands
β1–β5 and α-helices αA–αE; Figure 1). IREDs and βHADs exhibit
a classical Rossmann fold consisting of six parallel β-strands
(β1–β6) and an additional structural motif (β7-αF-β8) connect-
ing the Rossmann fold to a helical domain. β6 and β7 are
connected by a short α-helix, and β7 and β8 by the curved α-
helix αF; thus, the β-sheet of the Rossmann fold is extended by
the two antiparallel β-strands β7 and β8 (Figure 1A–C). Classical
SDRs show a very similar N-terminal half of the Rossmann-like
domain, but the C-terminal half deviates (Figure 1D). In contrast
to IREDs and βHADs, classical SDRs have additional short α-
helices after β5 and β6 and an additional seventh parallel β-
strand. Helices αD and αE are significantly longer than those in
IREDs or βHADs, and helices αD and αF are kinked. Helix αF is a
structural analogue in the three families, contributing to the
Rossmann fold in SDRs and to the β7-αF-β8 motif in IREDs and
βHADs. In comparison to the dimeric classical SDR-Bv, the
tetrameric SDR-Np has additional N- and C-terminal helices (tN
and tC) which contribute to the contact surface between the
two dimers. Whereas the NADPH-binding site is structurally
highly conserved in the three enzyme families, the substrate-
binding sites differ. The substrate-binding sites in IREDs and in
βHADs are formed by the connecting loops between β5 and αE
and between β6 and β7, and by residues located on the N-
terminal helical domain (Figure 1). The substrate-binding sites
in classical SDRs, however, are formed by the short α-helices
after β5 and β6, and residues on the two long α-helices αE and
αD. In the dimeric SDR-Bv, the loop after β5 is significantly
shorter and does not display the helix observed in the imine-

reducing SDR-Np (Figure S8). Additionally, the electrostatics of
the substrate-binding sites differ: the investigated IREDs display
a negatively charged substrate-binding site, whereas the
investigated βHADs and SDRs have a mainly positively charged
substrate-binding site (Figure S9). However, SDR-Np and SDR-Zt
exhibit a negatively charged residue (E212, classical SDR
standard position 210) on the flexible helix involved in substrate
binding. Furthermore, the mutation K184D in lc-βHAD-Ll leads
to a negative charge around the catalytic site (Figure S10a). In
contrast, in the less active sc-βHAD-Gm K171D, the substrate-
binding site remains positively charged (Figure S10b). For a
detailed comparison of the substrate binding site residues,
please see the Supporting Information.
We hypothesize that all investigated catalytic sites consist of
a proton donor (aspartate, glutamate, or tyrosine) and at least
three flanking residues supporting the proton donation (Fig-
ure 2, Table S7). In addition to a nonpolar flanking residue
which occurs in the considered IREDs, βHADs, and SDRs, one
characteristic flanking methionine occurs in IREDs and βHADs.
Except for R-IRED-Sr, all enzymes display at least one putatively
donor-polarizing residue. A serine or threonine flanking the
proton donor occurs in all considered IREDs (IRED standard
position 111; involved in cofactor binding),
[2]
βHADs, and SDRs
(classical SDR standard position 144). In the case of keto-
reducing SDRs, this catalytic serine has been proposed to
polarize the carbonyl moiety.
[11,12]
Therefore, we hypothesize
that these residues also polarize the imine moiety in the course
of imine reduction, supplemented by optional proton-media-
ting amino acids presumably forming a proton relay, as already
proposed for βHADs
[7]
and SDRs.
[11,12]
The exact composition
and arrangement of these residues in the putative catalytic sites
varies between the enzyme families and even among the family
members. Additionally, we hypothesize the existence of alter-
native catalytic sites in IREDs and βHADs. Thereby, single
residues can flank the conventional and the alternative proton
donors simultaneously.
In R-IRED-Sr, amino acid D170 (IRED standard position 187)
is the proton donor and is flanked by the imine-polarizing S94,
the nonpolar M120 and L174, and the proton-mediating H244
(IRED standard positions 111, 137, 191, 261). Interestingly,
amino acid W178 (IRED standard position 195) is flanked by the
imine-polarizing T241 (IRED standard position 258), the non-
polar M177 (IRED standard position 194) and L181 (IRED
standard position 198), and the proton-mediating H238 (IRED
standard position 255; Figures 2B and S11B). In R-IRED-Ao,
amino acid N171 (IRED standard position 187) at the conven-
tional proton donor position is flanked by nonpolar M122 and
L175 (IRED standard positions 137, 191). Compared to imine-
polarizing S94 and proton-mediating H244 in R-IRED-Sr,
residues S96 and H247 (IRED standard positions 111, 261) are
not oriented toward the conventional proton donor position.
On the basis of the published product complex,
[24]
amino acid
Y179 (IRED standard position 195) is suggested as the
alternative proton donor (Figure S11A) flanked by the imine-
polarizing T244 (IRED standard position 258), the nonpolar
M240 (IRED standard position 254) and L245 (IRED standard
position 259), the donor-polarizing N241 (IRED standard posi-
tion 255), and the proton-mediating H247 (IRED standard
position 261; Figures 2B and S11C). In the S-selective IRED from
Bacillus cereus (S-IRED-Bc), amino acid Y187 (IRED standard
position 187) is the conventional proton donor and is flanked
by the imine-polarizing S112 (IRED standard position 111), the
nonpolar M184 and M191 (IRED standard positions 184, 191),
the donor-polarizing Q188 (IRED standard position 188), and
the proton-mediating H261 (IRED standard position 261). W195
Figure 2. A) General scheme of imine-reducing catalytic sites. Dashed
coloring shows flanking residues that are not strictly present in all
considered enzymes. The proton donor (green) is always flanked by one
putatively imine-polarizing amino acid (orange). Except for the conventional
βHADs, all proton donors are flanked by at least one nonpolar amino acid
(pink). One or more donor-polarizing amino acids (blue) are present in all
considered enzymes except R-IRED-Sr. The characteristic flanking methionine
(red) was not observed in the imine-reducing SDRs. Optionally, proton-
mediating residues flanking the imine-polarizing residue can be present
(gray). The proposed conventional and catalytic sites are schematically
shown for the considered IREDs (B) and βHADs (C), where the dashed lines
mark the respective affiliation of the flanking residues and dashed green
coloring represents a non-proton-donating residue at the proposed
alternative proton donor position. D) The considered imine-reducing classical
SDRs did not present the characteristic flanking methionine or an alternative
catalytic site.

at the alternative donor position (IRED standard position 195) is
probably flanked by the imine-polarizing S258 (IRED standard
position 258) and the nonpolar M198 (IRED standard position
198) and L199 (IRED standard position 199; Figures 2B and
S11D). The lack of a complexed crystal structure gives rise to
uncertainties. In lc-βHAD-Ll, amino acid K184 is the conven-
tional proton donor and is flanked by the imine-polarizing S128,
the nonpolar M141, the proton-mediating H181 and H187, and
the donor-polarizing N102 and N188. In the lc-βHAD-Ll variant
with improved imine-reducing activity, K184 is replaced by
D184. The amino acid E191 is proposed as the alternative
proton donor and is flanked by the imine-polarizing S128, the
nonpolar M195 and I367, the proton-mediating H187 and C366,
and the donor-polarizing N188 (Figures 2C and S12C). In sc-
βHAD-At, amino acid K170 is the conventional proton donor
that is flanked by the imine-polarizing T95, the nonpolar M169,
and the donor-polarizing N174. In the sc-βHAD-At variant with
improved imine-reducing activity, K170 is replaced by D170.
The amino acid D239 is proposed as the alternative proton
donor and is flanked by the imine-polarizing T95, the nonpolar
M177 and F231, the proton-mediating H235, and the donor-
polarizing N174 and Q236 (Figures 2C and S12D). In sc-βHAD-
Gm, amino acid K171 is the conventional proton donor and is
flanked by the imine-polarizing T96, the nonpolar M170, and
the donor-polarizing N175. In the sc-βHAD-Gm variant with
slightly improved imine-reducing activity, K171 is replaced by
D171. The amino acid D240 is proposed as the alternative
proton donor and is flanked by the imine-polarizing T96, the
nonpolar M178, F232 and M237, the proton-mediating H236,
and the donor-polarizing N175, and K239 (Figures 2C and S12E).
In SDR-Np and SDR-Zt, Y161 (classical SDR standard position
159) is the conventional proton donor and is flanked by the
imine-polarizing S148 (classical SDR standard position 144), the
nonpolar Y100 (classical SDR standard position 96), the proton-
mediating C150 and H158 (classical SDR standard positions 146,
156), and the conventional donor-polarizing K165 (classical SDR
standard position 163; Figures 2D and S13). No flanking
methionine was found in the imine-reducing SDRs.
To evaluate the functional relevance of residues in the
substrate-binding site for imine reduction, alanine variants of
selected residues of SDR-Zt were generated. In addition to the
conventional catalytic residues for keto reduction, S148, Y161,
and K165 (classical SDR standard positions S144, Y159, K163),
substrate-binding residues with rare occurrence (< 4 %), Y100,
N102, C149, C150, H158, F202, and E212 (classical SDR standard
positions 96, 98, 145, 146, 156, 200, 210), were mutated
(Figure S14). Using 1 and 10 mM 2,3,3-trimethylindolenine (TMI)
as model imine substrate, respectively, specific activity and
conversion after 3 hours were determined (Table S8, Figure 3).
The alanine variants of the conventional catalytic amino acids
and of two proposed flanking residues (Y100, C150) nearly lost
their activity toward TMI. For variants C150A and Y161A, the
substrate conversion was low (in both cases < 1 %) and there-
fore consistent with the respective specific activity. However, a
discrepancy was noticed for Y100A, S148A, and K165A, for
which conversions of 39 %, 17 %, and 17 % were found,
respectively, whereas poor specific activities (2 � 1 mU/mg, 2 �
0.1 mU/mg, and 0 mU/mg) were detected. This deviation could
be caused by different KM values or substrate inhibition of the
variants, as the two screening methods required different
substrate concentrations. While SDR-Zt variants Y100A and
K165A converted TMI with high enantioselectivity (> 98 % ee of
R product), variant S148A displayed a loss in enantioselectivity
(17 % ee of R product). The alanine variant of the flanking
histidine (H158A) exhibited a decreased activity (32 % conver-
sion, 21 � 1 mU/mg specific activity), similar to C149A (34 %
conversion, 19 � 1 mU/mg specific activity) and E212A (37 %
conversion, 14 � 4 mU/mg).
While variant N102A showed a slightly increased specific
activity of 38 � 2 mU/mg, the conversion (39 %) was roughly
similar to that of the wild-type SDR-Zt (42 % conversion, 30 �
1 mU/mg). Interestingly, the F202A mutation resulted in a 10-
fold increase in activity (311 � 2 mU/mg) compared to the wild
type, whereby > 99 % of TMI was converted. To explore whether
C150 serves as a flanking residue which is essential for imine-
reducing activity, the variants C150S and C150D were exper-
imentally investigated (Table S8, Figure 3). The exchange
against the less acidic serine (variant C150S) resulted in a
significantly decreased activity (14 % conversion, undetectable
specific activity) compared to wild-type SDR-Zt, whereas the
exchange against the acidic aspartate (variant C150D) led to a
comparable specific activity (23 � 2 mU/mg) and 49 % conver-
sion of TMI.
Discussion
For the access to chiral amines, nature has evolved different
protein scaffolds into a broad range of biocatalysts with
different substrate specificities and high enantioselectivities of
up to > 99 %.
[21,23,24]
IREDs and βHADs are evolutionary related,
which is reflected in their similar structure and sequence.
[2,21]
SDRs display a different structure and no sequence similarity to
Figure 3. Biotransformation results for wild-type, alanine variants, and C150S
+ C150D variants of SDR-Zt. The specific activity (dark gray) on TMI and its
conversion after reaction for 3 h (light gray) are shown. Due to the
significantly increased activity of variant F202A, a scaling interruption has
been introduced for visualization purposes.

IREDs and βHADs.
[2,19,21]
Nevertheless, certain SDRs also catalyze
the reduction of C = N bonds.
[17,18]
The occurrence of this activity
in different enzyme families suggests an analogous develop-
ment of imine-reducing machineries with a similar catalytic
mechanism, namely the transfer of a proton and a hydride to
the respective substrate. Guided by the enzyme mechanism of
C = O reduction and the systematic evaluation of sequences and
structures of IREDs, βHADs, and imine-reducing SDRs, 12
experimentally characterized and three published variants,
[7]
we
have identified four common principles enabling imine-reduc-
ing activity in NAD(P)H-dependent enzymes: 1) a suitable
cofactor-binding domain, 2) proton donors adjusted in their
pK
a
, 3) flanking residues which contribute to pK
a
adjustment,
and 4) a negative electrostatic potential in the substrate-
binding site.
In the investigated enzyme families, the cofactor-binding
site is provided by the ubiquitous Rossmann-like domain, which
enables a productive orientation of the cofactor to allow
effective hydride donation. Sequence motifs for the binding of
these cofactors need to be present.
[28,29]
Additionally, residues
that are involved in cofactor binding can influence the ratio
between oxidative and reductive activity,
[30]
or contribute to
local secondary structures and conformational changes.
[31]
Although all investigated enzymes utilize NADPH as cofactor,
other hydride donors are conceivable, such as NADH which
serves as a cofactor for IREDs.
[32,33]
Next to aspartates, glutamates and tyrosines as proton
donor, it cannot be excluded that protonation occurs with other
residues (e. g., histidines). A pK
a
adjustment of the respective
donor is required to enable proton transfer under experimental
conditions (pH 6–8).
[7,17,21,24]
Nonpolar flanking residues or
negatively charged residues in the neighborhood result in an
increased pK
a
of the proton donor, whereas polar flanking
residues result in a decreased pK
a
.
In D-type IREDs, the pK
a
adjustment is enabled by two
nonpolar flanking residues. Grogan and co-workers proposed
that two nonpolar flanking residues in R-IRED-Sk enable the
strongly acidic proton donor to mediate proton donation.
[5]
This
is supported by the pK
a
of 7.7 of proton donor D170 at the
highly conserved conventional donor position (IRED standard
position 187; 93 % D in R-IREDs). Remarkably, the nonpolar
flanking residues M120 (IRED standard position 137) and L174
(IRED standard position 191) are highly conserved (94 % M and
96 % L, respectively) in R-IREDs. Apart from H244 (IRED standard
position 261; 31 % H in R-IREDs) as proton-mediating flanking
residue and S94 (IRED standard position 111; 45 % T, 33 % S in
R-IREDs) as imine-polarizing flanking residue, no polar flanking
residues were observed.
In Y-type IREDs (IRED standard position 187; 100 % Y in S-
IREDs), the pK
a
adjustment seems to be enabled by a donor-
polarizing flanking residue. In contrast to D-type IREDs that
feature two nonpolar flanking residues, Y-type feature one
nonpolar (IRED standard position 191; 51 % L, 39 % M in S-IREDs)
and one predominantly polar flanking residue (IRED standard
position 184; 56 % Q, 36 % A, 1 % L, 5 % M in S-IREDs). This
supports the hypothesis of the importance of suitable flanking
residues to adapt the pK
a
of the respective proton donor.
Recently, some exceptional IREDs lacking the conventional
proton donors have been identified.
[24,34]
For instance, R-IRED-Ao
lacks the conserved aspartate at IRED standard position 187.
Therefore, the conventional catalytic site seems to be “inactive”
while the alternative catalytic site could be considered as
“active”, as it displays a tyrosine at the alternative donor
position (IRED standard position 195; 57 % Y in R-IREDs). As in Y-
type IREDs, the pK
a
adjustment seems to be enabled by a
donor-polarizing flanking residue: N241 (IRED standard position
255; 49 % Q, 14 % H, 12 % N in R-IREDs).
In the investigated K!D variants of βHADs,
[7]
the pK
a
adjustment is enabled by at least one donor-polarizing flanking
residue connecting the engineered conventional proton donor
(D184 in lc-βHAD-Ll; D170 in sc-βHAD-At; D171 in sc-βHAD-Gm)
with the alternative proton donor (E191 in lc-βHAD-Ll; D239 in
sc-βHAD-At; D240 in sc-βHAD-Gm). Such neighboring carbox-
ylates are assumed to result in a higher pK
a
value
[35]
and
therefore enable the proton transfer to the imine substrate
under experimental conditions. Additionally, conventional and
alternative catalytic sites display a methionine as nonpolar
flanking residue. In sc-βHAD-At and sc-βHAD-Gm, M169 and
M170, respectively, could serve as nonpolar flanking residue of
the respective conventional proton donor, although their side
chains are oriented away from the proton donor in the crystal
structures. However, upon substrate binding, they might
reorient toward the proton donor, providing a similar function
as M141 in lc-βHAD-Ll.
In imine-reducing SDRs, the pK
a
adjustment of the proton
donor tyrosine (classical SDR standard position 159) is presum-
ably realized by lysine (classical SDR standard position 163) as
donor-polarizing flanking residue, which also adjusts the pK
a
of
the proton donor to enable keto reduction.
[8,11,12,15,36]
However,
due to its positive charge, the electrostatic potential in the
substrate-binding site is detrimental for stabilization of the
positively charged iminium transition state. This might be
partially compensated by the acidic character of the proton-
mediating flanking C150 (classical SDR standard position 146),
which is supported by the reduced specific activity of the
C150A and C150S variants of SDR-Zt, whereas the C150D variant
exhibits comparable activity to the wild type. In addition to the
local electrostatic effect of the flanking residues on the proton
donor, the overall electrostatic potential in the substrate-
binding site of imine-reducing enzymes has been proposed to
have a crucial impact on the stabilization of the positively
charged iminium transition state.
[2,7,23]
This is supported by the
50 % decrease in specific activity of the SDR-Zt E212A variant, as
well as the overall negative potential at the substrate-binding
site of IREDs and of the K!D βHAD variants (except for the
positively charged carboxyl-binding site).
[2,37,38]
The broad spectrum of accepted substrates by IREDs
[20,21,39,40]
indicates that pure lock and key models are not adequate to
explain enzyme-catalyzed imine reduction. Recent crystallo-
graphic studies report the existence of open and close
conformations of IRED, βHAD, and SDR complexes as well as
induced fit effects upon ligand binding to βHADs and
SDRs.
[16,24,26,27]
However, the lack of co-crystallized imine sub-
strates limits the deduction of mechanistic principles. Moreover,

dynamic aspects, such as the influence of flexible loops on
substrate specificity, enantioselectivity, and promiscuous activ-
ities, have to be taken into account. This can be exemplified by
noroxomaritidine reductase (SDR-Np): in addition to its physio-
logical enone reduction activity,
[16]
SDR-Np is able to reduce
different keto and imine substrates.
[17]
The crystal structure of
SDR-Np indicates that an intrinsically disordered loop (after β5)
forms a kinked helix upon substrate binding, resulting in the
catalytically active conformation. Remarkably, all investigated
enzymes display substrate-binding residues situated in helical
structures involved in conformational changes or in flexible
loop regions.
[16,24,26,27]
The functional relevance of dynamic
fluctuations between multiple protein states has been long
recognized,
[41]
and is supported by recent studies in the context
of promiscuous binding and unstructured protein regions.
[42–45]
The combination of intrinsically disordered binding regions,
the concept of alternative proton donors, and our proposed
principles for imine reduction provide a model to support the
interpretation of reported puzzling observations. Despite the
exchange of the conventional proton donor by alanine, the R-
IRED-Sr D170A and R-IRED-St D172A variants (IRED standard
position 187) were reported to maintain a considerable residual
activity of 15 % and 5 %, respectively.
[23]
This residual activity
could be explained by the presence of alternative proton
donors, for instance Y219 and Y279 in R-IRED-Sr, and Y221 and
Y283 in R-IRED-St (IRED standard positions 236 and 296,
respectively). Tyrosine at standard position 236 is moderately
conserved in R- and S-IREDs (34 % and 44 %, respectively;
Table S4), while tyrosine at standard position 296 only occurs in
R-IREDs (28 %; Table S4). Several residues in the close environ-
ment of Y219 and Y279 in R-IRED-Sr could serve as flanking
residues in respect to conformational changes upon substrate
binding. Due to the lack of crystallized proton donor variants,
no distinct flanking residues are proposed. We expect the
existence of multiple proton donor positions in IREDs with
adequate flanking residues for pK
a
adjustment. Further to the
herein proposed proton donors, amino acids in reasonable
positions could be involved in catalysis, provided they result in
a functional proton transfer. This is supported by the character-
ization of a imine reductase lacking the conventional aspartate,
but displaying a histidine residue at a neighboring position.
[34]
The existence of multiple alternative proton donors is further
supported by the R-IRED-Ao Y179A and Y179F variants which
maintained imine-reducing activity.
[24]
The altered enantioselec-
tivities and kinetic parameters of these variants point toward an
alternative stabilization of the transition state. Thus, we suspect
that Y231 (IRED standard position 245) provides an alternative
solution for proton donation as it is considerably conserved in
R- and S-IREDs (63 % and 13 %, respectively; Table S4), it is
located on a partially unfolded helix providing a flexible
substrate-binding loop, and there are three reasonable flanking
residues (M127, Q217, I218). The sc-βHAD-At K170F variant
resulted in an eightfold increased amine product formation,
[7]
which can be explained by the presence of D239 as alternative
proton donor. The protonation catalyzed by this alternative
donor might be more efficient due to the less positive binding
site of the K170F variant compared to the wild type. The sc-
βHAD-Gm K171D variant was reported to display a significantly
lower imine-reducing activity compared to the corresponding
sc-βHAD-At K170D variant. The different topological arrange-
ment of the flanking residue K239 (as derived from the
uncomplexed crystal structure) influencing the change in
substrate-binding-site electrostatics (the K171D variant of sc-
βHAD-Gm still displays a positive charge due to K239) could
explain the differences in imine-reducing activity. The K170D/
N174L sc-βHAD-At and K171D/N175L sc-βHAD-Gm variants
were intended to introduce a nonpolar flanking residue as
present at IRED standard position 191.
[7]
No activity was
determined, as the variants did not result in stable protein.
Based on our model, we proposed to additionally knock out the
alternative proton donor to prevent repulsion. Indeed, the
K170D/N174L/D239A sc-βHAD-At variant resulted in stable
protein, converting 2-methyl-1-pyrroline, 3,4-dihydroisoquino-
line, and 6-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine with specific activ-
ities (qualitatively determined by NADPH-depletion assay with
lysate) of 34.5 � 1.2 mU/mL, 33.2 � 0.5 mU/mL, and 35.4 �
0.9 mU/mL. The K170D/D239A sc-βHAD-At variant showed no
activity.
[46]
Clearly, catalytic machinery alone is not sufficient: the
substrate also has to have access to the catalytic machinery.
Bulky residues in substrate access tunnels or on flexible
substrate-binding structures can impede the entrance or the
productive orientation of nonphysiological substrates,
respectively.
[47,48]
Residues with such functionalities have been
described as “gatekeepers” for various enzyme families,
[7,49–51]
such as F231 in sc-βHAD-At, and might also play a role in
classical SDRs: in SDR-Zt, the substrate-binding site in the closed
conformation is narrowed by F202 on the disordered loop/helix
region (after β5). This could hinder the efficient orientation and
stabilization of the substrate toward the catalytic machinery.
Consequently, the F202A variant results in a tenfold increased
activity toward the bulky substrate TMI.
Conclusion
In recent years, enzymes with imine-reducing activity have
increasingly been discovered in multiple enzyme families with
different global sequences and structures. This implies that
imine-reducing activity is independent of homology and
suggests the existence of yet hidden commonalities in imine-
reducing enzymes. The systematic structure-based analysis of
global and local features in imine-reducing IREDs, βHADs, and
SDRs has revealed common principles in the different enzyme
families, thus partly rationalizing their shared catalytic scope. As
these principles might also apply to other NAD(P)H-dependent
oxidoreductases, our model could support enzyme discovery,
add to the diversity of imine-reducing enzymes, and contribute
to rational enzyme engineering approaches toward imine
reduction.
