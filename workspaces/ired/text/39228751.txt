Ephedra-type alkaloids represent a large class of natural and synthetic phenylpropanolamine molecules with 
great pharmaceutical values. However, the existing methods typically rely on chemical approaches to diversify 
the N-group modification of Ephedra-type alkaloids. Herein, we report a 2-step enzymatic assembly line 
for creating structurally diverse Ephedra-type alkaloids to replace the conventional chemical modification 
steps. We first identified a new carboligase from Bacillus subtilis (BsAlsS, acetolactate synthase) as a robust 
catalyst to yield different phenylacetylcarbinol (PAC) analogs from diverse aromatic aldehydes with near 100% 
conversions. Subsequently, we screened imine reductases (IREDs) for the reductive amination of PAC analogs. 
It was found that IRG02 from Streptomyces albidoflavus had good activities with conversions ranging from 37% 
to 84% for the reductive alkylamination with diverse amine partners such as allylamine, propargylamine, and 
cyclopropylamine. Overall, 3 new bio-modifications at the N-group of Ephedra-type alkaloids were established. 
T aken together, our work lays a foundation for the future implementation of biocatalysis for synthesizing 
structurally diverse Ephedra-type alkaloids with potential new pharmaceutical applications.
Introduction
Ephedra-type alkaloids are naturally produced by Catha edulis 
and members of the genus Ephedra [1,2]. This class of alkaloids 
run a gamut of pharmacologic activities such as the bronchodila-
tor and adrenergic receptor agonists [3–5] for treating bronchial 
asthma and low blood pressure [6]. Plant extraction methods 
are commonly used to obtain natural Ephedra-type alkaloids. 
However, due to the limited applications of natural Ephedra-
type alkaloid, there is current interest in producing synthetic 
Ephedra-type alkaloids with improved pharmacological proper-
ties and reduced side effects [7]. Researchers have created non-
natural Ephedra-type alkaloids with diverse functionalization 
by chemical or biocatalytic approaches. The structural modifica-
tions on the phenyl ring and the N-group are commonly imple-
mented to create synthetic Ephedra-type alkaloids with changed 
pharmacologic activities [8,9]. For instance, butaxamine with 
the N-group modification is used as a selective β2-adrenoceptor 
antagonist [10]. Methoxamine (a potential candidate as a vaso-
pressor [11]) and metaraminol (the prevention and treatment 
of acute hypotension [12,13]) are 2 representative synthetic alka-
loids with modifications at the phenyl ring.
In plants, (pseudo)ephedrines are synthesized from the pre-
cursor of 1-phenylpropane-1,2-dione by the condensation of 
the benzylic fragment with pyruvate [14], which is further 
modified by transamination and N-alkylation. Although it is 
important to elucidate the natural biosynthetic pathway for 
Ephedra alkaloids, the structural diversity from the natural 
pathway is only limited to a few types of compounds. Instead, 
synthetic Ephedra-type alkaloids were reported to provide sym-
pathomimetic drugs and chemical synthons [15], and it is desir-
able to generate more structurally diverse Ephedra-type alkaloids 
with potential novel pharmaceutical activities. However, current 
efforts of using biological approaches mainly have focused on 
generating the diversity on the phenyl ring using different aromatic 
aldehydes as starting substrates [16,17]. There is plenty of scope 
for diversifying the N-group of Ephedra-type alkaloids [18].
For the creation of different synthetic Ephedra-type alka-
loids, chemical strategies involve the use of toxic reagents, long 
reaction procedures, and isolation [19–21], which are not envi-
ronmentally friendly processes. In addition, different group 
modifications require distinct synthetic routes, which would 
limit its diversified synthesis [22,23]. Biological approaches have 
been developed to synthesize synthetic and natural Ephedra-
type alkaloids. The early biocatalytic methods focused on modi-
fying the phenyl ring to produce different nor(pseudo)ephedrine 
analogs (Fig. 1A). For instance, Rother et al. reported the syn-
thesis of 4 nor(pseudo)ephedrine isomers by combining car -
boligases such as pyruvate decarboxylases (PDCs) [24] and 
acetohydroxyacid synthases (AHASs) [25] and transaminases 
(TAs) with different enantioselectivities [17,26]. Based on the 
promiscuity of these enzymes, these enzymatic cascades were

further expanded to the synthesis of methoxamine [11] and meta-
raminol [13]. For the N-functionalization, S-adenosylmethionine 
(SAM)-dependent methyltransferases (PNMTs) [27] have been 
reported to catalyze the N-methylation of nor(pseudo)ephed-
rine. However, other N-modifications of nor(pseudo)ephedrine 
have to rely on chemical approaches (Fig. 1A), which require 
the use of toxic metal catalysts and large amounts of organic 
solvents [28].
To overcome the limitations of phenyl-ring modification and 
N-functionalization of non-natural Ephedra-type alkaloids, we 
aimed to develop a more concise 2-step enzymatic assembly 
line to create diverse Ephedra-type alkaloids, which eliminates 
toxic chemical approaches (Fig. 1B). We first identified that 
acetolactate synthase from Bacillus subtilis (BsAlsS) exhibited 
a superior substrate scope for the carboligation of diverse aro-
matic aldehydes with pyruvate. To address the limitation of 
biological N-alkylamination, we screened and identified an 
imine reductase (IRED) from Streptomyces albidoflavus for one-
step reductive alkylamination with different amine donors. 
Overall, we successfully synthesized 16 phenylacetylcarbinol 
(PAC)-class α-hydroxyketones with good yields and demon-
strated 3 new bio-modifications at the N-group of Ephedra-type 
alkaloids. Taken together, we successfully explored the biologi-
cal approach to expand the structural diversity of synthetic 
Ephedra-type alkaloids, which will provide new drug candidates 
with potential pharmaceutical applications.
Materials and Methods
Strains and reagents
Escherichia coli strain DH5α was used for plasmid construc-
tions. E. coli MG1655 RARE [29] was used for whole-cell bio-
transformation studies. Luria–Bertani (LB) medium (1% tryptone, 
0.5% yeast extract, 1% NaCl) with appropriate antibiotics 
(100 μg/ml ampicillin, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol, and 50 μg/
ml streptomycin) was used for the routine cultivation of E. coli. 
All restriction enzymes, T4 ligase, and Phusion High-Fidelity 
DNA polymerase were purchased from New England Biolabs 
(Beverly, MA, USA). The gel extraction kit and the plasmid 
purification kit were purchased from BioFlux (Shanghai, China). 
All chemicals, reagents, and resources used in this study are 
listed in Table S1.
Cloning and strain construction
Empty vector pRSFDuet-1, pCDFuet-1, and pET28a were pur-
chased from Novagen. Gene EcilvB together with EcilvN were 
amplified from the genomic DNA of E. coli strain MG1655. 
Gene BsalsS was amplified from the genomic DNA of B. subtilis 
168. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fragments were 
cloned into pRSFDuet-1 vector at BamHI and XhoI restriction 
sites to construct plasmid pRSF-EcilvBN and pRSF-BsalsS. 
Plasmid pET28a-AspRedAmQ240A and pET28a-IR77A208N were 
synthesized by GenScript (Nanjing, Jiangsu, China). Plasmid 
pET28a-IRG02 and pET21b-Bm GDH [30] are gifts from  
S.-S. Gao, Chinse Academy of Sciences. Glucose dehydro-
genase from Bacillus megaterium (BmGDH) was cloned into 
pCDFDuet-1 vector to yield pCDF-BmGDH. All primers used 
in this study are listed in Table S2. Plasmids used in this study 
are listed in Table S3, and all strains are listed in Table S4.
Protein expression and purification

1.2% tryptone, 1.25% K 2HPO4, 0.23% KH2PO4, 4% glycerol) 
with corresponding antibiotics. The E. coli culture was first incu-
bated at 37 °C and 250 rpm. When the optical density of cell 
culture reached 0.8 to 1.0, isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside 
(IPTG) was added to a final concentration of 0.4 mM, and the

cell culture was further cultivated at 20 °C and 250 rpm for 
16 to 18 h to induce the expression of desired proteins. The 
optical density of cell culture was measured by BioTek Synergy 
H1 Reader (BioTek, USA).
Protein purified procedure: E. coli cells were harvested at 
7,000 rpm for 5 min and the pellets were resuspended in the 
buffer containing 1.25% K2HPO4, 0.23% KH2PO4, 2.93% NaCl, 
0.07% imidazole, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. 
The cell lysis was performed by ultrasonication (3 s ON, 3 s 
OFF , 70 cycles), and the supernatant was collected by centrifu-
gation at 4 °C, 10,000 rpm for 10 min. After filtering the super-
natant by 0.45-μm filter, the cell lysate was loaded into gravity 
flow columns charged with 5 ml of Ni-NTA agarose and eluted 
by the buffer containing 500 mM NaCl and 20 to 200 mM 
imidazole. The concentration of purified protein was deter -
mined by the Bradford protein assay kit. The purity of proteins 
was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel 
electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Further removing salt ions and 
imidazole was carried out by dialysis.
Biotransformation procedure
For the whole-cell biocatalyst, cells were harvested at a speed 
of 7,000 rpm for 5 min. Cell pellets were washed once with 
distilled water and resuspended to a final concentration of 30 or 
60 g/l cell dry weight (CDW) in potassium phosphate (KP) 
buffer (pH 7.0, 100 mM). Biotransformation was conducted 
with either whole-cell catalysts or purified enzymes. The whole-
cell biotransformation was typically performed in a 1-ml reaction 
mixture, the purified enzyme-catalyzed reaction was performed 
in a 0.5-ml reaction mixture, and the scale-up preparation was 
performed in a 30-ml reaction mixture.
For the carboligase-mediated condensation reaction, 1 ml 
of reaction mixture consists of 5 to 30 mM aromatic aldehyde, 
10 to 60 mM pyruvate (the ratio of aldehyde to pyruvate was 
kept at 1:2), 20 g/l d-glucose, 10 g/l CDW whole-cell biocatalysts, 
0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 60 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2·6H2O, 
and 0.1 mM thiamine pyrophosphate (ThDP), in 1 ml of KP 
buffer (pH 7.0, 100 mM). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C 
with a shaking speed of 250 rpm for 24 h. For purified enzyme-
mediated reaction, a 0.5-ml reaction mixture was prepared in 
a similar way with an equivalent of enzyme. For the scale-up 
preparation of α-hydroxyketones, 30 ml of reaction mixtures 
was prepared in a similar way to 1 ml of the reaction mixture 
as mentioned above with 20 mM aromatic aldehyde and 40 mM 
pyruvate. Substrates a and b were performed with 30 mM, and 
substrates h, j, k, and p were performed with 10 mM.
IRED-mediated N-alkylamination of α-hydroxyketone
PAC (1a) was used as the model substrate to screen suitable 
IREDs. The biotransformation contains 20 g/l d-glucose, 5 mM 
PAC, the corresponding amines donors, and 20 g/l CDW 
whole-cell biocatalysts coexpressing IRED and BmGDH, 
in 1 ml of KP buffer (pH 7.0, 100 mM). Reaction mixtures 
were incubated at 30 °C with a shaking speed of 250 rpm for 
24 h. For IRG02-catalyzed reductive N-alkylamination of PAC 
analogs, the reaction mixture contains 5 mM PAC-class 
α-hydroxyketones, 20 g/l d -glucose, 20 g/l CDW whole-cell 
catalysts with IRG02 and BmGDH, and the appropriate ratio 
of amine donors, in 1 ml of KP buffer (pH 7.0, 100 mM). The 
reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C with a shaking speed 
of 250 rpm for 24 h.
One-pot biocatalysis procedure
For the one-pot concurrent synthesis of Ephedra-type alka-
loids, the reaction mixture comprises 5 to 30 mM aldehyde, 
10 to 60 mM pyruvate, the appropriate ratio of amine donors, 
20 g/l d-glucose, 20 g/l CDW whole-cell catalysts (expressing 
BsAlsS, IRG02, and Bm GDH), 0.5 mM DTT, 60 mM KCl, 
5 mM MgCl 2·6H2O, and 0.1 mM ThDP , in 1 ml of KP buffer 
(pH 7.0, 100 mM). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 
30 °C with a shaking speed of 250 rpm for 24 h. For the one-
pot sequential step, the reaction mixtures were carried out 
in a similar way to the one-pot concurrent step without the 
supplementation of amine donors. The reaction mixtures were 
incubated at 30 °C with a shaking speed of 250 rpm for 4 h 
to perform the BsAlsS-mediated carboligation. Subsequently, 
an appropriate ratio of amine donor was added to make up 
to 1 ml of reaction volume, and the IRED-mediated reduc -
tive N-alkylamination was continued for another 20 h.
HPLC and MS/MS analysis
For product analysis, 50 μl of the sample was diluted with appro-
priate amounts of 10% acetonitrile (ACN) solution and centri-
fuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min to remove the cell pellet. The 
supernatant was analyzed by high-performance liquid chroma-
tography (HPLC). HPLC analysis was performed using Shimadzu 
Prominence LC-20AD system with a C18 reversed-phase column 
(Shim-pack GIST C18-AQ, 5 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm). Different ratios 
of ACN and ultrapure water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) 
were used as the mobile phase. The flow rate was set at 1 ml/min, 
and the column temperature was maintained at 40 °C. Both stan-
dards and samples were determined using the detection wave-
length at 210 nm. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis 
was performed on the TripleTOF 5600+ System. Ions with an 
intensity higher than 2.0 × 104 counts were fragmented by MS/
MS fragmentation with the resolution set to 60,000, AGC (auto-
matic gain control) target to 3.0 × 104, maximum injection time 
to 50 ms, and HCD (higher-energy C trap dissociation) collision 
energy (%) to 30. Ions were excluded from further fragmentation 
if they occurred more than once in 60 s.
Docking analysis
Docking procedures are executed using GNINA software. The 
AB chains of BsAlsS, the AC chains of EcIlvBN, and the AB 
chains of 2VJY are selected for superposition to identify the 
reactive pocket. Only one pocket is retained for downstream 
analyses. ThDP within the AB chains of BsAlsS and the AC 
chains of EcIlvBN is manually modified to hydroxyethylThDP 
(HEThDP). The coordinates of pyruvate near the ThDP of the 
AC chain in 2VJY serve as a reference point for the ligand 
4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, and a box with a 4-Å radius around 
pyruvate is utilized for docking. Each docking iteration pro-
duces 100 poses, with an exhaustive sampling value set to 50. 
Poses are selected based on a combination of high-scoring 
ranks and appropriate reaction distances for binding conforma-
tions. For the docking results of BsAlsS with 4-hydroxybenz-
aldehyde, the pose with the second-highest convolutional 
neural networks (CNN) score is chosen for analysis (reaction 
distance is 3.5 Å, CNN pose score =  0.9094, CNN affinity = 
3.690). For the docking results of EcIlvBN with 4-hydroxy-
benzaldehyde, the pose with the highest CNN score is 
selected for analysis (reaction distance is 4.2 Å, CNN 
pose score = 0.8442, CNN affinity = 3.985). Interactions are visu-
alized using PyMOL software.

Results and Discussion
Identification of acetolactate synthase from  
B. subtilis for PAC production
Carboligation of substituted aromatic aldehydes and pyruvate 
generates α-hydroxyketones, which serve as intermediates to 
produce natural and synthetic Ephedra-type alkaloids. To 
increase the diversity at the phenyl ring, the pivotal goal is 
to identify a highly active carboligase with a broad substrate 
scope. The family of ThDP-dependent lyases catalyzes a broad 
range of C–C formation and cleavage reactions. PDCs and 
AHASs have been extensively explored for biomanufacturing 
PAC and its analogs [25,31–33]. Compared to the PDC-
mediated carboligation that results in acetaldehyde as a by-
product, AHASs have a clear advantage in their intrinsic 
carboligation without such by-product [25]. To date, EcIlvBN 
from E. coli that contains a large subunit IlvB and a small 
regulatory subunit IlvN represents one of the most commonly 
used AHASs for PAC production [11,13]. Considering that 
BsAlsS has been extensively applied to the production of 
branched-chain amino acid-derived chemicals including iso -
butanol [34,35], it is likely that BsAlsS might have the carbo -
ligation activity for condensing benzaldehyde and pyruvate 
to generate L-PAC. However, catabolic acetolactate synthase 
(CALS) [36,37] such as BsAlsS from B. subtilis  is rarely stud-
ied for PAC production.
As depicted in Fig. 2A, ThDP-dependent carboligases 
typically share the same catalytic cycle for the condensation 
of aromatic aldehydes with pyruvate [38,39]. The bound ThDP 
anion reacts with pyruvate to form lactylThDP (LThDP), 
which undergoes decarboxylation to form HEThDP . In the 
presence of benzaldehyde, the HEThDP intermediate can 
react with benzaldehyde to form a bound arylacetyl carbinol, 
which is further released as PAC. In this study, molecular 
docking was first applied to compare the active sites of BsAlsS 
[Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 4RJJ] with EcIlvBN (PDB ID: 
6LPI). Notably, both BsAlsS and the catalytic unit of EcIlvBN 
share a similar substrate binding pocket (Fig. 2B), suggesting 
the potential implementability of BsAlsS for condensing 
benzaldehyde with pyruvate. Additionally, we performed 
molecular docking simulations with another bulky substrate 
of 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. As shown in Fig. 2C, aromatic 
rings of residues Tyr 481 and Phe 456 in BsAlsS are likely to 
guide the substrate HEThDP into a more stable position. The 
Met residue at position 483 from BsAlsS is smaller, conferring 
greater substrate tolerance. More interestingly, the residue 
Met483 in BsAlsS may act as a hydrogen bond acceptor, form-
ing bonds with the OH group on the substrate. These robust 
interactions may allow 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde to bind near 
the substrate HEThDP at an optimal reaction distance of 
3.5 Å (Fig. 2C). In comparison, Leu 476 in EcIlvBN is a larger 
amino acid than Met 483 in BsAlsS, and this size difference 
can lead to steric hindrance, potentially affecting the binding 
of bulky aromatic substrates.
To experimentally validate the activity of BsAlsS, both benz-
aldehyde (BAL; a) and 4-hydroxy benzaldehyde (4-HBAL; b) 
were tested as the substrates. As shown in Fig. 2D, the holoen-
zyme EcIlvBN converted 20 mM BAL a to 13 mM PAC 1a (~65% 
conversion). 4-HBAL b (10 mM) gave 8 mM 4-hydroxy PAC 1b 
by EcIlvBN, but the activity of EcIlvBN was completely abolished 
at 20 mM 4-HBAL b . Encouragingly, BsAlsS exhibited a high 
catalytic activity toward substrates a and b, and both a and b 
were fully converted to products 1a and 1b within 4 h. As BsAlsS 
is a FAD-independent enzyme, we noticed that the cell pellet of 
BsAlsS-expressing E. coli gave a different color when compared 
to that of EcIlvBN-expressing E. coli (Fig. S1). Further validation 
of the whole-cell biocatalysts by SDS-PAGE confirmed the suc-
cessful overexpression of MR-BsAlsS and MR-EcIlvBN (Fig. 2E). 
Furthermore, we conducted a comparative analysis of the bio-
catalytic efficiency between the whole-cell biocatalyst and the 
purified BsAlsS. The results revealed that the whole-cell biocata-
lyst exhibited a comparable activity to that of the purified enzyme 
(Fig. S3). For substrate a, we observed a slightly higher biocata-
lytic efficiency of the whole-cell biocatalyst compared to that of 
the purified BsAlsS. However, a lower conversion of substrate b 
in whole-cell biocatalysis compared to that of the purified BsAlsS 
was observed (Fig. S3). We reasoned that substrate b  might 
exhibit a reduced permeability across the cell membrane barrier 
in the whole-cell biocatalysis due to the presence of an additional 
hydroxy group. Nevertheless, considering that whole-cell bioca-
talysis could substantially reduce the operating cost when com-
pared to purified enzymes, it is more feasible for the future 
scale-up of bioproduction processes.
Broad substrate scope of BsAlsS for synthesis of 
diverse α-hydroxyketones
After obtaining the encouraging results from BsAlsS, we 
attempted to further assess its catalytic activity on various sub-
stituted aromatic aldehydes. As listed in Fig. 3, a set of sub-
strates c to p with different substitutions of hydroxy, methoxy, 
and halogen at ortho , meta, and para positions of the phenyl 
ring were selected. All reactions proceeded with ~100% conver-
sions under 5 mM c  to p (data not shown). Even at the con-
centration of 20 mM c to p, the majority of products 1c to 1p 
were obtained at good yields, as calculated by liquid chroma-
tography analysis (Fig. S4) and structurally validated by mass 
spectrum analysis (Fig. S12). For instance, substrates c, d, g, i, 
l, m, n, and o afforded products 1c, 1d, 1g, 1i, 1l, 1m, 1n, and 
1o with excellent >99% conversions. Substrates e, f, h, k, and 
j gave products 1e, 1f, 1h, 1k, and 1j with efficiencies ranging 
from 50 to 92%. Substrate p was poorly transformed when the 
concentration was over 10 mM, and 20 mM substrate p  only 
gave 1p at 16% conversion, indicating that the combined ortho- 
and meta-methoxy functionalization might hinder the sub-
strate binding to BsAlsS.
Some trends could be observed from the conversion profile: 
aromatic aldehydes substituted with hydroxyl group in the 
ortho , meta, and para  position ( 1b, 1g, 1l) provided high 
conversions; halogen modifications showed that fluorine-
substituted substrates ( 1d, 1i ) are more active than those 
with chlorine and bromine modifications (1e, 1f, 1j, 1k), prob-
ably because the smaller size of side group [40,41] can make 
the substrates easily interact with the active site of BsAlsS. The 
para functionalization provided higher conversions than the 
ortho modification (1b to 1f versus 1g to 1k). Excellent conver-
sions were achieved by combining para- with ortho-modifications 
(2 hydroxyls 1n, 2 methoxys 1o, or hydroxyl with methoxy 
1p). Overall, BsAlsS exhibited relatively good activities in gen-
erating a series of PAC class α-hydroxyketones with modifications 
of halogen, hydroxyl, and methoxy groups. Therefore, BsAlsS 
could serve as a robust biocatalyst for providing diverse sub-
stituted α-hydroxyketones, which can be further functionalized 
into synthetic Ephedra-type alkaloids.

Screening IREDs for reductive N-alkylamination of 
α-hydroxyketones
To date, the biological method for N-alkylation is limited to 
SAM-dependent PNMTs [27]. Chemical approaches are required 
to functionalize the N -group of nor(pseudo)ephedrine with 
other N-alkylations besides N-methylation. Recently, asym-
metric N-alkylation of ketones has gained great interest by 
using IREDs [42,43]. The implementation of IREDs for the 
reductive N-alkylamination of α-hydroxyketones simplifies the 
traditional TA-mediated transamination followed by chemical 
modifications into a single-step enzymatic reaction (Fig. 4A). 
The diversity of N-alkylation products generated by IREDs can 
be easily adjusted by altering amine partners.
In this study, a set of IREDs was selected for testing: 
AspRedAmQ240A from Aspergillus oryzae was chosen for its 
broad-scope carbonyl compounds with a variety of primary 
and secondary amines [44]; IR77A208N from Ensifer adhaerens 
[45] and IRG02 from S. albidoflavus [30] were selected because 
of their excellent capacities for bulky substrates. The relative 
activity of IREDs toward the representative PAC (1a) was

determined using a set of amine partners (3  to 6). As shown 
in Fig. S5, we confirmed the successful expression of IRED 
together with Bm GDH in E. coli. Based on the activity chart 
of different IREDs (Fig. 4B), IRG02 exhibited excellent activ -
ity toward amine donors 4  to 6: Substrate 1a was converted 
to secondary amine products 4a to 6a at 37%, 84%, and 77%. 
IRG02 showed higher specific activities with propargylamine 
5 and cyclopropylamine 6  over that of ammonia 3  and allyl-
amine 4. However, we found that IR77 A208N  exhibited a 
higher activity with ammonia 3  when compared to that of 
IRG02. In comparison, AspRedAm Q240A was less reactive 
toward tested amine partners 3 to 6  (Figs. S7 to S10). The 
assay revealed that IREDs such as IRG02 and IR77 A208N 
would facilitate the reductive N -alkylamination of PAC with 
good conversions. Three new bio-modifications (allyl 4a, 
propargyl 5a, and cyclopropyl 6a) at the N -group were estab-
lished for the first time for creating synthetic Ephedra-type 
alkaloids, which were structurally confirmed by mass spec-
trum analysis (Fig. S12).
To further improve the reductive N-alkylamination of PAC, 
we attempted to optimize the ratio of amine equivalents for 
improved conversions. As shown in Fig. 4C, different conversions 
by IRG02 were achieved: Substrates 1a and 3 (40 equivalents) 
gave product 3a with 58% conversion; substrates 1a and 4 (40 
equivalents) gave product 4a with 72% conversion; substrates 
1a and 5 (20 equivalents) gave product 5a with 91% conver -
sion; substrates 1a and 6  (10 equivalents) delivered product 
6a with 77% conversion. In addition, IR77A208N-mediated reduc-
tive amination achieved 58% conversion for the synthesis of 
product 3a.
Based on the PAC-mediated reductive amination protocol, 
a series of biotransformation was performed for transferring 
PAC-class α-hydroxyketones (1b to 1p) with different amine 
partners (4 to 6) using IRG02. When allylamine 4 was used as 
an amine partner, IRG02 showed good activities toward 1c, 
1d, and 1i and generated alkenyl-containing derivatives 4c, 
4d, and 4i with 28 to 86% conversions (Fig. 5 and Fig. S11). 
Propargylamine 5 afforded products 5c to 5f, 5l, and 5m with 
38 to 92% conversions (Fig. 5 and Fig. S11). Substrate 6 gave 
products 6b, 6c, 6d, 6g, 6m, and 6n with 50 to 88% conversions 
(Fig. 5 and Fig. S11). In addition, representative synthetic 
Ephedra-type alkaloids were also confirmed by mass spectrum 
analysis (Fig. S12). Overall, 18 synthetic Ephedra-type alkaloids 
were successfully produced, and there is still plenty of room 
for future exploration of new combinations with different 
α-hydroxyketones and amine partners.

Fig. 5. Expanding the N-functionalization on diverse PAC analogs. The whole-cell catalyst of MR-IRG02-BmGDH was used to diversify Ephedra-type alkaloids with different PAC 
analogs and amine donors. The scope of amine donors: allylamine 3, propargylamine 4, and cyclopropylamine 5. The scope of PAC analogs was randomly chosen from 1a to 
1p. The conversions were roughly estimated by substrate consumption. Error bars indicate standard deviations from triplicate experiments.

One-pot biocatalytic synthesis of  
Ephedra-type alkaloids
Upon confirming the substrate scope of BsAlsS and IRG02, we 
next attempted to explore the one-pot cascaded biocatalysis for 
the synthesis of Ephedra-type alkaloids using a 2-step enzy-
matic assembly line. As shown from the SDS-PAGE result (Fig. 
S6.1), we successfully expressed BsAlsS, IRG02, and BmGDH 
in a single E. coli. However, during the one-pot reaction, IRG02 
exhibited a clear preference for the reductive amination of aro-
matic aldehydes over α-hydroxyketones (Fig. S6.2), favoring 
the formation of by-products. One-pot concurrent conversion 
of BAL a, pyruvate 1, and cyclopropylamine 6 resulted in 
approximately 74% of the substrate a into a by-product, whereas 
the target product 6a was only obtained at 26 ± 1% (Fig. 6). 
Subsequently, the one-pot sequential strategy was introduced 
to temporally separate 2 enzymatic reactions: Amine donors 
were added after the completion of BsAlsS-mediated carboliga-
tion. As shown in Table 2, 5 mM a gave 2.95 mM product 6a, 
reaching approximately 59% conversion. Additionally, we also 
expanded the one-pot sequential reaction for the synthesis of 
4a and 5a, both of which reached ~31% conversion.
Conclusion
To replace the traditional TA-mediated transamination followed 
by chemical N-alkylamination, we adopted the IRED-mediated 
reductive N-alkylamination for the one-step functionaliza -
tion of PAC. IRG02 from S. albidoflavus  was identified as a 
good candidate for the reductive alkylamination of diverse 
α-hydroxyketones with different amine partners. Overall, 18 
non-natural Ephedra-type alkaloids were generated by IRG02, 
and some of these new-to-nature compounds were first-time 
fabricated by biological approaches, which might serve as poten-
tial candidates for sympathomimetic drugs [18]. Notably, the 
N-alkylamination by propargylamine (5) is of particular interest 
to chemists, as further diversity at the alkynyl group could be 
easily created by using click chemistry [46]. In addition, these 
new-to-nature compounds might be used for the synthesis of 
synthetic tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) [47] for improved 
antitumor, antiparasitic, and neurological activities. In the future, 
the structural diversity of synthetic Ephedra-type alkaloids will 
be further expanded by engineered CALSs and IREDs with bet-
ter activities [48,49]. In summary, we envision that more syn-
thetic Ephedra-type alkaloids could be created through the 
integration of knowledge and tools from chemistry and biology 
[50,51].
