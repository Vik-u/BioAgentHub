N-methylated amino acids are found in Nature in various biological compounds. N-methylation 
of amino acids has been shown to improve pharmacokinetic properties of peptide drugs due to 
conformational changes, improved proteolytic stability and/or higher lipophilicity. Due to these 
characteristics N-methylated amino acids received increasing interest by the pharmaceutical industry. 
Syntheses of N-methylated amino acids by chemical and biocatalytic approaches are known, but often 
show incomplete stereoselectivity, low yields or expensive co-factor regeneration. So far a one-step 
fermentative process from sugars has not yet been described. Here, a one-step conversion of sugars 
and methylamine to the N-methylated amino acid N-methyl-l-alanine was developed. A whole-
cell biocatalyst was derived from a pyruvate overproducing C. glutamicum strain by heterologous 
expression of the N-methyl-l-amino acid dehydrogenase gene from Pseudomonas putida. As proof-
of-concept, N-methyl-l-alanine titers of 31.7 g L
−1 with a yield of 0.71 g per g glucose were achieved in 
fed-batch cultivation. The C. glutamicum strain producing this imine reductase enzyme was engineered 
further to extend this green chemistry route to production of N-methyl-l-alanine from alternative feed 
stocks such as starch or the lignocellulosic sugars xylose and arabinose.
N-alkylation of amino acids occur in bacteria and eukaryotes. In green tea leaves, the N5-ethylated L-glutamine 
derivative theanine was shown to be responsible for their umami taste 1,2. N-methylated amino acids are also 
found in depsipeptides that are used as drugs e.g. vancomycin, actinomycin D and cyclosporine. N-methylamino 
acid containing peptides often show higher stability against proteolytic degradation and/or increased membrane 
permeability as compared to non-methylated peptides3–5. Accordingly, the substitution of an N-terminal glycine 
residue for sarcosine in an angiotensin II analog enhanced in vivo activity as a potential result of longer half-life 
against proteolytic degradation6. Similar to l-proline, N-methylated amino acids are known to stabilize discrete 
conformations of peptides as shown for the exchange of l-pipecolic acid by N-methyl-l-alanine in the ATPase 
inhibitor efrapeptin C7.
In certain bacteria, utilization of mono-methylamine (MMA) may lead to N-methylated amino acids. Some 
bacteria that can grow with reduced carbon substrates without carbon-carbon bonds such as methane or meth-
anol can utilize MMA as sole source of carbon. The N-methylated amino acid N-methylglutamate occurs as an 
intermediate of the so-called monomethylamine catabolic pathway in representatives of these methylotrophic 
bacteria, e.g. Methylocella silvestris, Methyloversatilis universalis or Methylobacterium extorquens
8–11. In cell free 
extracts of Pseudomonas  MS N-methylalanine (NMeAla) was observed when MMA was added to the growth

medium12. An enzyme which catalyzes the reductive methylamination of pyruvate to NMeAla in the presence of 
MMA was isolated and named N-methylalanine dehydrogenase (Fig. 1)13. Based on its native function of reduc-
ing piperideine-2-carboxylate in addition to the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines this enzyme belongs to the 
class of imine reductases (IREDs)14,15. The corresponding gene dpkA from Pseudomonas putida ATCC12633 was 
identified and characterization of the encoded enzyme revealed a somewhat relaxed substrate spectrum. Since 
α-keto acids such as phenylpyruvate, ketohexanoate and ketoisobutyrate were accepted aside from pyruvate and 
the enzyme also converts other alkylamines such as N-ethylamine, it was named N-methyl-l-amino acid dehy-
drogenase or NMAADH
16–18. Reductive alkylamination of α-keto acids by DpkA using MMA appears similar to 
reductive amination by amino acid dehydrogenases using ammonium. Y et, the structure of DpkA shows similar-
ities to a new subclass of Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent oxidoreductases 
with the rare SESAS (seven-stranded predominantly antiparallel β-sheet) fold for NADPH-binding
19. The physi-
ological role of NMAADH activity in pseudomonads, however, remains elusive.
Although the formation of N-alkylated amino acids such as NMeAla has been shown during the character -
ization of NMAADH 16–18, efficient production via biocatalysis or by fermentation has not yet been described. 
Biocatalytic approaches may offer advantages over chemical methods such as N-alkylation of amino acids or the 
asymmetric Strecker synthesis since the chemical methods may use hazardous chemicals, give only incomplete 
stereoselectivity and low yields, while side reactions like dimethylation of the amino group may occur
20.
Fermentative production of amino acids, mainly l-glutamate and l-lysine, occurs at the million-ton-scale21. 
For more than fifty years, C. glutamicum has been used for the safe production of food and feed amino acids22,23. 
Besides the flavor enhancing l-glutamate24 and the feed additive l-lysine25, further amino acids and related com-
pounds can efficiently be produced by glucose- and ammonium-based fermentation using recombinant C. glu-
tamicum strains
26,27. Metabolic engineering of C. glutamicum has not been restricted to amino acids but also 
production of the α-keto acids pyruvate, ketoisovalerate and ketoisocaproate 28–31 were established. Taking the 
broad substrate range of the NMAADH from P . putida into account, it is important to engineer a host such as C. 
glutamicum to overproduce only one α-keto acid, in this study pyruvate.
Here we describe the one-step production of the N-methylated amino acid NMeAla from glucose and meth-
ylamine by a newly constructed C. glutamicum whole cell biocatalyst. The NMAADH gene dpkA from P . putida 
was expressed in a pyruvate overproducing C. glutamicum strain31. This pyruvate producing strain, named ELB-P , 
is able to secrete up to 17.6 g L−1 pyruvate with low by-product formation in shake flasks31. To achieve high titers 
of pyruvate, the genome of this strain carries deletions of the genes encoding pyruvate-converting enzymes. 
Figure 1. Schematic overview of the reaction catalyzed by DpkA (A) and its integration into the central carbon 
metabolism in C. glutamicum NMeAla1 (B). The gene deletions for improved pyruvate production are shown by 
black arrows with red double bars: deletion of aceE (encoding PDHE1p, the E1p subunit of the PDHC) and pqo 
(encoding pyruvate-quinone oxidoreductase, PQO) and both genes coding both major enzymes for l-alanine 
supply by pyruvate aminotransferases (alaT and avtA, encoding the alanine aminotransferase AlaT and the 
valine-pyruvate aminotransferase AvtA, respectively) were deleted. In addition, the acetohydroxyacid synthase 
(AHAS) activity was downregulated by deletion of the C-terminal part of ilvN (small subunit of AHAS) shown 
by red dashed arrow. Enzymes highlighted by red background indicate missing or down regulated enzymes. The 
thick arrow displays the NMeAla formation by heterologous expressed dpkA from P . putida KT2440 coding for 
the N-methylated amino acid dehydrogenase DpkA (green shadowed Enzyme).

Starting with a pyruvate dehydrogenase gene (aceE  encoding the E1p subunit) deficient strain 32, which accu-
mulates high titers of pyruvate33, additional deletion of the pyruvate-quinone oxidoreductase gene ( pqo)34 and 
deletion of the C-terminal regulatory domain of the acetohydroxyacid synthase gene (ilvN)35,36 further increased 
pyruvate availability. To prevent the reduction of pyruvate to lactic acid, the ldhA (NAD-dependent l-lactic acid 
dehydrogenase)35 was deleted. Additionally, formation of the by-product l-alanine was reduced by deletion of the 
alanine aminotransferase gene (alaT) and valine-pyruvate aminotransferase gene (avtA)37 (Fig. 1). C. glutamicum 
ELB-P requires acetate for biomass formation as consequence of the aceE deletion and uses glucose for produc-
tion of pyruvate31,38. A derivative of C. glutamicum ELB-P expressing dpkA from P . putida was constructed here 
and demonstrated to be suitable for the one-step production of NMeAla from MMA and glucose or alternative 
feedstocks.
Results
Corynebacterium glutamicum as suitable host for NMeAla production. To determine if C. glutami-
cum is a suitable host for the production of the N -methylated amino acid NMeAla, the growth behavior of the 
wild type strain was analyzed under different conditions. To test whether C. glutamicum is able to utilize MMA or 
NMeAla as sole carbon or nitrogen source it was grown in minimal medium with either 50 mm MMA, NMeAla 
or glucose as sole carbon source or with either 50 mm MMA, 50 mm NMeAla or 30 mm ammonium sulfate and 
17 mm urea as nitrogen source. This growth experiment revealed that C. glutamicum could neither use MMA nor 
NMeAla as sole carbon or nitrogen source (data not shown).
Possible effects due to substrate or product toxicity were detected in growth experiments with C. glutamicum 
wild type in minimal medium with glucose and increasing concentrations of MMA (0.05 m to 1.5 m) or NMeAla 
(0.05 m to 0.25 m). The growth rate was diminished at higher concentrations to about half-maximal rates at 1.8 m 
MMA and 0.4 m NMeAla, respectively (Fig. 2). In order to determine if MMA affects global gene expression in 
C. glutamicum, the transcriptomes were compared during growth in glucose minimal medium containing either 
250 mm MMA or 125 mm ammonium sulfate. The finding that very few genes changed expression and none had 
a function in nitrogen metabolism (Supplementary Table) indicated that MMA does not elicit a specific gene 
expression response.
Metabolic engineering of C. glutamicum for fermentative production of NMeAla. The relatively 
small impacts of the substrate MMA and the product NMeAla on growth make C. glutamicum a suitable host 
organism for the fermentative production of NMeAla if a) sufficient pyruvate is available and b) NMeAla is trans-
ported out of the C. glutamicum cell. Therefore, the pyruvate overproducing C. glutamicum strain ELB-P
31 was 
chosen as platform strain for engineering fermentative production of NMeAla. Since NMAADH activity had not 
been reported for C. glutamicum, the NMAADH gene dpkA from P . putida was cloned into the expression vec-
tor pVWEx1 and used to transform C. glutamicum ELB-P (Fig. 1). The resulting strain ELB-P(pVWEx1-dkpA) 
was designated as NMeAla1. Crude extracts of cells carrying either the empty vector or the dpkA  expression 
vector were assayed for reductive N-methylamination of pyruvate. As presumed, no activity was detected for 
C. glutamicum carrying the empty vector whereas a specific activity of 24 ± 1 mU (mg protein
−1) for reductive 
N-methylamination of pyruvate was detected in the dpkA  expressing strain. This result indicates functional 
expression of dpkA from P . putida in C. glutamicum.
In order to test C. glutamicum strain NMeAla1 for NMeAla production, the strain was cultivated in minimal 
medium supplemented with 16.6 g L−1 potassium acetate, 2 mm l-Ala, 30 g L−1 glucose and 3.1 g L−1 MMA. HPLC 
analysis of supernatants after cultivation for 72 h revealed that C. glutamicum NMeAla1 produced 7.6 ± 0.1 g L−1 
NMeAla (Fig. 3). Only 0.2 ± 0.1 g L−1 pyruvate were produced, but the by-product l-alanine accumulated to con-
siderable concentrations (4.3 ± 0.9 g L−1; Fig. 3).
Figure 2. Growth rates of C. glutamicum wild type in the presence of varying concentrations of MMA or 
NMeAla. C. glutamicum wild type was grown in presence of increasing MMA (0.05 m to 1.5 m) or NMeAla 
(0.05 m to 0.25 m) concentrations and specific growth rates were determined. Half maximal growth rates were 
obtained by extrapolation.

Improvement of precursor conversion and reduction of by-product formation. The formation of 
l-alanine as by-product may be due to the high concentrations of ammonium sulfate and urea present as nitrogen 
sources in CGXII minimal medium. CGXII minimal medium was optimized for production of l -lysine which 
contains two ammonium groups and reducing the nitrogen content in CGXII medium has previously been shown 
to improve production of l-proline and γ-aminobutyric acid that only contain a single ammonium group 39,40. 
For production of NMeAla, MMA is used for reductive N-methylamination of pyruvate while ammonium sul-
fate and urea are required solely to support biomass formation. Therefore, the nitrogen amount of the minimal 
medium was reduced by half (2.5 instead of 5 g L−1 urea and 10 instead of 20 g L−1 ammonium sulfate) and to 10% 
(0.5 instead of 5 g L−1 urea and 2 instead of 20 g L−1 ammonium sulfate). Under the latter condition formation of 
the by-product l-alanine was diminished, however, increased pyruvate concentrations and decreased NMeAla 
concentrations in the supernatants indicated incomplete reductive N-methylamination of pyruvate to NMeAla 
(Fig. 3A). Subsequently, the MMA concentration was increased to 10.9 g L−1 and in addition the glucose concen-
tration was reduced to 20 g L−1. As a result, only low concentrations of pyruvate, l -alanine and l -valine accu-
mulated as by-products while a titer of 10.5  ± 0.4 g L−1 of NMeAla was obtained within 72  h (Fig. 3). To obtain 
an idea of the fate of carbon from glucose and acetate as substrates the concentrations of carbon present in the 
biomass and products formed were plotted (Fig.  3B). While E. coli shows overflow metabolism at high glucose 
concentrations, C. glutamicum does not
22,23. Specifically, the strain used here did neither secrete acetate nor lactate 
due to gene deletions introduced by metabolic engineering (ΔaceE, Δpqo, ΔldhA). As expected for aerobic pro-
cesses, about 50% of carbon from the growth substrates will end up in CO2. For example under the condition with 
20 g L−1 glucose and 16.6 g L−1 potassium acetate (together 12 g carbon L−1), 11% carbon was found in biomass, 
2% in L-alanine, 1% in L-valine, 1% in pyruvate and 31% NMeAla, while CO2 formation likely explains the fate 
of 55% of the carbon.
Figure 3. NMeAla, l-alanine, l-valine and pyruvate production data (A) and carbon balance (B) of C. 
glutamicum strain NMeAla1 under different conditions. Cells were cultivated in minimal medium CGXII 
containing 30 g L−1 or 20 g L−1 glucose and 16.6 g L−1 potassium acetate, 2 mm l-Ala and 1 mm IPTG for 
induction of gene expression. The nitrogen amount of the minimal medium was reduced to 50% or 10% 
respectively, the glucose and MMA amount were optimized to finally 20 g L
−1 glucose and 10.9 g L−1 MMA. The 
culture supernatants were harvested after incubation for 72 h and analyzed by HPLC. (A) Concentrations are 
given as means with standard deviation of three replicates. n.d.: not detected. (B) To assess the fate of carbon 
from glucose and acetate as substrates their concentrations in gram carbon per liter is plotted. The gram carbon 
per liter concentrations of biomass formed (green) and of the formed products l-alanine (blue), l-valine 
(black), pyruvate (grey), and NMeAla (red) are plotted. For NMeAla, the carbon derived from MMA was not 
considered. The gram carbon per liter concentrations of CO
2 and unknown byproducts are depicted in open 
columns. Amines < 0.1 g L−1 and carbohydrates < 0.5 g L−1 were not considered.

Thus, after balancing concentrations of the nitrogen and carbon sources for growth (ammonium sulfate, urea 
and acetate) with the substrates for production (glucose and MMA), NMeAla was produced by fermentation 
using C. glutamicum strain ELB-P(pVWEx1-dkpA) with a volumetric productivity of 0.15 g L−1 h−1 and a yield 
of 0.53 g g−1 glucose.
Fed-Batch bioreactor process of NMeAla production. To evaluate an enhancement of NMeAla 
production by feeding glucose and MMA a fed-batch cultivation in 4 L scale (initial volume) was performed. 
For higher cell density and higher production titers the fed-batch cultivation was performed with two inde -
pendent feed phases (Fig.  4). The first feeding solution contained acetate and was coupled to the relative dis -
solved oxygen saturation (rDOS) signal with the intent to increase the biocatalyst concentration and to improve 
growth-associated production of NMeAla. The second feeding phase started after 22 h with an initial supply 
of 162 mL followed by a linear feed (12.3  mL h−1) of glucose and MMA (ratio 1:3) to boost growth-decoupled 
production of NMeAla. At the end of the fed-batch bioreactor process (98 h) 86.7 g acetate and 178.8 g glucose 
were consumed and the residual glucose concentration was 16.3 g L−1. A yield of 0.48 g NMeAla per g of acetate 
and glucose was achieved. Considering that growth of C. glutamicum NMeAla1 depends on acetate whereas 
production does not, a product yield on glucose was calculated to be 0.71 g g−1 glucose at a final titer of 31.7 g L−1 
NMeAla and a volumetric productivity of 0.35 g L−1 h−1. The side-product l-alanine and the precursor pyruvate 
only accumulated to low concentrations (0.5 g L−1 and 2.1 g L−1, respectively). Thus, fermentative production of 
NMeAla in a fed-batch process resulted in enhanced final titer, volumetric productivity and yield in comparison 
to shake flask experiments.
Establishing production of NMeAla from alternative feedstocks. Sustainable production from 
sugars that have competing uses in human and animal nutrition have to be succeeded by production processes 
based on second generation feedstocks such as lignocellulosic hydrolysates. Fermentative production of amino 
acids is typically based on glucose present in molasses or obtained from starch by hydrolysis. Direct utilization 
of starch as well as of the pentose sugars xylose and arabinose that can be obtained by hydrolysis of lignocellu-
losics required metabolic engineering of C. glutamicum
41. Based on these strategies the C. glutamicum strains 
NMeAla1(pEXCT99A-amyA), NMeAla1(pEKEx3-xylAXc-xylBCg), and NMeAla1(pEXCT99A-araBAD) were con-
structed and tested for production of NMeAla from starch, arabinose and xylose, respectively. Upon expression of 
the α-amylase gene amyA from Streptomyces griseus, C. glutamicum can utilize starch
42 and C. glutamicum strain 
NMeAla1(pEXCT99A-amyA) produced 7.5 ± 0.1 g L−1 NMeAla in minimal medium containing 30 g L−1 starch 
and 16.6 g L−1 potassium acetate (Fig.  5). Heterologous expression of the arabinose utilization operon araBAD  
from E. coli enables C. glutamicum to utilize arabinose as carbon and energy source 43,44. C. glutamicum strain 
NMeAla1(pEXCT99A-araBAD) produced 4.2 ± 0.5 g L−1 NMeAla in minimal medium containing 30 g L−1 arab-
inose and 16.6 g L−1 potassium acetate (Fig. 5). Efficient utilization of the lignocellulose pentose sugar xylose was 
enabled by expression of the xylose isomerase gene xylA from Xanthomonas campestris combined with overex-
pression of the endogenous xylulokinase gene xylB45. In CGXII minimal medium containing 30 g L−1 xylose and 
16.6 g L−1 potassium acetate, C. glutamicum strain NMeAla1(pEKEx3-xylAB) produced 7.0 ± 0.1 g L−1 of NMeAla 
(Fig. 5). Taken together, efficient production of NMeAla from three alternative feedstocks was shown.
Figure 4. Fed-batch cultivation with C. glutamicum NMeAla1 in minimal medium supplemented with 
potassium acetate and glucose as carbon and energy sources. A fermenter with an initial start volume of 4 L was 
used. First feed phase (potassium acetate) was coupled to the rDOS value. After 22 h the second feed phase was 
started by the initial addition of 162 mL of a glucose/MMA solution followed by a linear feed of 12.3 mL h−1. 
The biomass formation (black open squares), concentrations of NMeAla (red circles), l-alanine (blue squares), 
pyruvate (grey squares), acetate (green filled triangles) and glucose (green open triangles) were depicted. The 
volume of both feeds is shown as black lines. All depicted concentrations and the biomass formation was related 
to the initial volume.

Discussion
Fermentative access to the N-methylated amino acid NMeAla was achieved by introduction of the NMAADH 
gene dpkA from P . putida into the pyruvate overproducing C. glutamicum strain ELB-P . N-methyl-l-alanine titers 
of 31.7 g L−1 with a yield of 0.71 g per g glucose were achieved in fed-batch cultivation. The described C. glutami-
cum strains allow, to the best of our knowledge, the first fermentative production of NMeAla reported to date. 
Di-N-methyl-l-alanine, a frequent by-product in chemical methylation of l-alanine, was not observed. However, 
pyruvate and l-alanine accumulated as minor by-products.
l-Alanine was also a by-product of pyruvate 31 and l-serine production 46 although the genes alanine ami-
notransferase (alaT) and valine-pyruvate aminotransferase (avtA) have been deleted. Thus, at least one further 
l-alanine forming transaminase must be active in C. glutamicum.
Abolishing export of pyruvate and l-alanine was not possible since the export systems have not been iden-
tified. Deletion of export genes has been shown to be valuable to improve production of γ -aminobutyric acid 
(deletion of cgmA to abolish putrescine export) 47, 5-aminovalerate and ectoine (deletion of lysine export gene 
lysE)48–50. As is the case for l -alanine, the export system for NMeAla is unknown. Given their similar struc-
ture it is conceivable that both l -alanine and NMeAla are exported by the same unknown export system. 
Alternatively, NMeAla may be substrate of the export system of C. glutamicum for branched-chain amino acids 
and l-methionine BrnEF51–53. The transcriptional regulator Lrp is activating transcription of brnFE at elevated 
intracellular concentrations of branched-chain amino acids and l-methionine54. Since N-methylation increases 
lipophilicity55,56, diffusion of the more lipophilic NMeAla across the cytoplasmic membrane of C. glutamicum is 
more relevant as compared to l-alanine. However, diffusion of amino acids across the cytoplasmic membranes 
of bacteria cannot explain transport processes against concentration gradients which require active transport 
systems. This not only holds true for charged amino acids such as l-lysine57, but also for uncharged amino acids 
such as l-isoleucine51,52. Future work will have to unravel the export systems of NMeAla, l-alanine and pyruvate 
in C. glutamicum.
In contrast, uptake of MMA into the C. glutamicum  cell has been studied to some detail. The uncharged 
ammonia (NH3) is able to diffuse across the membrane, but its protonated form ammonium (NH4
+) is actively 
imported by the transport proteins AmtA and AmtB58,59. Notably, as a probe for ammonium uptake, 14C-labelled 
MMA was used to determine uptake rates. Ammonium uptake in enteric bacteria such as E. coli operates by a 
comparable mechanism as shown for E. coli protein AmtB
60.
The one-step process of NMeAla production will benefit from more efficient reductive N -methylamination 
of pyruvate by increasing the amount and/or the activity of NMAADH. Here, the NMAADH gene dpkA  was 
cloned into the medium copy vector pVWEx1 and transcription initiated from the IPTG inducible promoter Ptrc 
and translation initiated from a standard ribosome binding site. Thus, as shown for expression of other genes in 
recombinant C. glutamicum, dpkA expression may benefit from the choice of the expression vector, the promoter 
and the ribosome binding site
61–64.
Engineering of DpkA for more efficient reductive N-methylamination of pyruvate to yield NMeAla will also 
increase fermentative NMeAla production. The NMAADH DpkA used here for reductive N -methylamination 
of pyruvate has been shown to be part of the d -lysine degradation pathway in pseudomonads where it acts as 
imine reductase (IRED) reducing its native substrate piperideine-2-carboxylate 18. IREDs that catalyze the 
asymmetric reduction of prochiral imines to chiral amines by using NAD(P)H as a hydride source are gain-
ing increasing interest in bioorganic chemistry65–68. The substrate range is not restricted to cyclic imines and as 
shown for DpkA16–18, the (S)-selective IRED from Streptomyces sp . GF354669 and the (R)-selective IRED from 
Streptosporangium roseum70 also catalyze asymmetric reductive amination from suitable ketone and amine pre-
cursors. The latter reaction is expected to proceed via an imine either in solution or in the active site of the 
enzyme. Structure-function analysis of DkpA and other IREDs to improve asymmetric reductive amination from 
suitable ketone and amine precursors has not yet been described, but would be valuable to increase reductive 
N-methylamination of pyruvate to NMeAla by DkpA or derived variants. This approach has successfully been 
applied to the P450 oxidoreductase BM3 from B. megaterium
71. By mutagenesis the enzyme was engineered to 
oxidize not only fatty acids72, but also N-alkanes73,74, the more sterically demanding β -ionone75, indole76,77 and 
others.

Here, we have developed a fermentative route to the N -methylated amino acid NMeAla. The biocatalytic 
route was based on N-methyl-l-amino acid dehydrogenase (NMAADH), which was integrated into the central 
metabolism of a pyruvate overproducing C. glutamicum strain. A final NMeAla titer of 31.7 g L−1 was achieved in 
fed-batch fermentation after balancing the ratio of the major substrates glucose and MMA. Additionally, NMeAla 
production from the alternative carbon sources xylose, arabinose and starch was enabled, thus, providing the 
basis for sustainable NMeAla production from second generation feedstocks.
Experimental
Bacterial strains and growth conditions. The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. 
E. coli DH5α78 was used for vector construction. C. glutamicum pre-cultures were grown in Lysogeny Broth (LB) 
medium containing 7 g L−1 sodium acetate in 500 mL baffled flask at 30 °C inoculated from a fresh LB agar plate. 
When necessary, the medium was supplemented with kanamycin (25 µg mL−1), spectromycin (100 µg mL−1) and/or 
tetracyclin (5 µg mL−1). The gene expression from the vectors pVWEx1, pEKEx3 and pECXT99A was induced by 
adding Isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (1 mm). For growth experiments or fermentative produc-
tion of C. glutamicum cells were incubated in LB medium containing 7 g L−1 sodium acetate overnight on a rotary 
shaker, harvested (4000 × g, 7 min) and washed with TN buffer pH 6.3 (50 mm TrisHCl, 50 mm NaCl). The cells 
were inoculated to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 1 in 50 mL CGXII minimal medium22 supplemented with 
40 g L−1 glucose (wild type) or with blends of 20 or 30 g L−1 glucose, 16.6 g L−1 potassium acetate and 2 mm L-alanine 
(ELB-P). Growth in 500 mL baffled flasks was followed by measuring the OD600 using V-1200 Spectrophotometer 
(VWR, Radnor, PA, USA). The Biolector microfermentation system (m2p-labs, Aachen, Germany) was used for 
determination of the growth behavior in the presence of MMA or NMeAla and the carbon and nitrogen source 
growth tests. The shaking frequency was adjusted to 1200 rpm and 48-well flower plate wells with cultivation vol-
umes of 1 mL were used and growth was followed by backscattered light at 620 nm and a signal gain factor of 20.
Fed-Batch cultivation. Fermentation of C. glutamicum NMeAla1 was performed in an initial working 
volume of 4 L in a bioreactor (7 L NLF , Bioengineering AG, Switzerland) at 30 °C, 0.2 bar overpressure, and an 
aeration rate of 5 NL min−1. Stirrer speed was controlled to maintain relative dissolved oxygen saturation at 30% 
during growth phase. Due to controlled addition of KOH (4 m) and phosphoric acid (10% (w/w)) the pH was 
maintained at 7.0. To avoid foaming the antifoam Struktol® J647 was added manually when necessary. The first 
feeding phase with 26.7 g L−1 potassium acetate solution (total volume: 500 mL) was depending on the relative 
dissolved oxygen saturation, it was activated when the rDOS signal rose above 60% and stopped when rDOS felt 
below 60%. The second feeding phase (164 g L
−1 glucose and 84 g L−1 MMA (total volume: 1000 mL)) was started 
manually after 22 h. Samples were taken automatically every 2 hours within the first 24 h and every 8 hours after-
wards and cooled to 4 °C until analysis. For fermentation a modified CGXII minimal medium was used: 5 g L−1 
(NH4)2SO4, 1.25 g L−1 urea, 1 g L−1 K2HPO4, 1 g L−1 KH2PO4, 5 g L−1 yeast extract in addition to the same concen-
trations of trace elements and vitamins as described elsewhere18. Modified CGXII was supplemented with 15 g L−1 
KAc, 20 g L−1 glucose, 9.3 g L−1 MMA and 25 µg mL−1 kanamycin. The fermenter was inoculated by addition of 
450 mL of a shake flask culture grown in the described media with extra 42 g L−1 MOPS buffer.
Molecular genetic techniques and strain construction. The standard molecular genetic techniques were  
performed as described in Grenn and Sambrook, 2012. Transformation of E. coli DH5 α78 was performed  
by heat shock79, plasmid DNA transfer into C. glutamicum by electroporation 22.The gene dpkA was amplified  
from P . putida KT2440 genomic DNA by using the primers dpkA-fw (GCCAAGCTTGCATGCCTGCAGA  
AAGGAGGCCCTTCAGATG TCCGCACCTTCCACCAG) and dpkA-rv (GGGATCCTCTAGAGTCGACCT  
GCATCAGCCAAGCAGCTCTTTCA); dpkA-fw carries the RBS sequence (italicized). For higher expression

rates the start codon of dpkA was changed from GTG to ATG (underlined). The vector pVWEx1 was restricted  
with BamHI and incubated in a Gibson assembly 80 with the PCR product for construction of plasmid  
pVWEx1-dpkA  which was used to transform C. glutamicum strains. For construction of the expression  
plasmid harboring the genes for arabinose degradation araBAD  from E. coli  was amplified using  
genomic DNA of E. coli MG1655 with the primers araBAD-fw (CATGGAATTCGAGCTCGGTACCC  
GGGGAAAGGAGGCCCTTCAGATG GCGATTGCAATTGGCCT) and araBAD-rv (GCCTGCAGGTCG  
ACTCTAGAGGATCTTACTGCCCGTAATATGCCT); araBAD-fw carries the RBS sequence (italicized). The 
vector pECXT99A was incubated with BamHI for restriction and incubated with the PCR product in an Gibson 
assembly
80 for plasmid construction. The constructed plasmid was used to transform C. glutamicum strains.
Crude extract preparation and enzyme assays. Cells for crude extracts were inoculated as described 
above and harvested after 20 h and stored at −20 °C. From this step cell pellets and crude extract were handled 
at 4 °C or on ice. 150 to 200 mg cells were resuspended in 1 mL 100 mm glycine buffer (pH 10) and sonicated (UP 
200 S, Dr. Hielscher GmbH, Teltow, Germany) at an amplitude of 60% and a duty cycle of 0.5 for 9 min. Protein 
concentration of the cell free extracts obtained by centrifugation (20200 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) was determined by the 
Bradford method81 with bovine serum albumin as reference.
For determination of the reductive N -methylamination activity the assay was performed as described 18. In 
a total volume of 1  mL containing 100  mm glycine buffer (pH 10), 60  mm MMA, 10 mm pyruvate and 0.3  mm 
NADPH the consumption of NADPH (epsilon = 6200 L mol−1 cm−1) was detected at 340 nm at 30 °C for 3 min. 
The assay was performed in at least triplicates.
Quantification of amino acids and organic acids. Extracellular amino acids and pyruvate were quan-
tified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (1200 series, Agilent Technologies Deutschland 
GmbH, Böblingen, Germany). The culture supernatants were collected and centrifuged (20200 × g, 15 min) for 
further analysis.
For the detection of NMeAla and l -alanine the samples were derivatised with 9-fluorenylmethyl chloro -
carbonate (Fmoc-Cl) according to published methods
82 with modifications 39. l-proline was used as internal 
standard. The separation was carried out by a reversed phase HPLC using a pre-column (LiChrospher 100 RP8 
EC-5 μ (40 mm × 4.6 mm), CS-Chromatographie Service GmbH, Langerwehe, Germany) and a main column 
(LiChrospher 100 RP8 EC-5 μ (125 mm × 4.6 mm), CS Chromatographie Service GmbH). The detection was per-
formed with a fluorescence detector (FLD G1321A, 1200 series, Agilent Technologies) with the excitation and 
emission wavelength of 263 nm and 310 nm respectively.
Analysis of l-valine was performed by an automatic pre-column derivatization with ortho-phthaldialdehyde 
(OPA)
83 and separated on a reversed phase HPLC using pre- and main column (LiChrospher 100 RP8 EC-5μ , 
125 mm × 4.6 mm, CS Chromatographie Service GmbH) with l-asparagine as internal standard. Detection of the 
fluorescent derivatives was carried out with a fluorescence detector with an excitation wavelength of 230 nm and 
an emission wavelength of 450 nm. Concentrations exceeding 0.1 g L−1 were considered further.
Pyruvate, acetate and glucose concentrations were measured with an amino exchange column (Aminex, 
300 mm × 8 mm, 10 μm particle size, 25 Å pore diameter, CS Chromatographie Service GmbH) under isocratic 
conditions for 17 min at 60 °C with 5 mm sulfuric acid and a flow rate of 0,8 mL min−1. The detection was carried 
out with a Diode Array Detector (DAD, 1200 series, Agilent Technologies) at 210 nm. Concentrations exceeding 
0.5 g L−1 were considered further.
Transcriptome analysis using DNA microarrays. For the transcriptome analysis in the presence of 
MMA, C. glutamicum wild type cells were grown in minimal medium supplemented with 250 mm MMA or 
125 mm ammonium sulfate to exponential growth phase and harvested at an OD600 of 4. The RNA was isolated 
and transcriptome analysis using whole genome microarrays were performed as described previously84.
