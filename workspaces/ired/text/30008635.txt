Abstract: Asymmetricr eductive aminations are
some of the most importantr eactions in the prepara-
tion of active pharmaceuticals,a sc hiral aminesf ea-
ture in many of the worldQsm ost important drugs.
Although manye nzymes have been applied to the
synthesiso fc hiral amines,t he development of reduc-
tive amination reactions that use enzymes is attrac-
tive,a si tw ould permit the one-stept ransformation
of readily available prochiral ketones into chiral
amines of high optical purity.H owever, as most nat-
ural “reductive aminase”a ctivitieso perate on keto
acids,a nd many are able to use only ammonia as the
amine donor, there is considerable scope for the en-
gineering of natural enzymes for the reductive ami-
nation of ketones,a nd also for the preparation of
secondary amines using alkylamines as donors.T his
review summarises research into the development of
NAD(P)H-dependent dehydrogenases for the reduc-
tive amination of ketones,i ncluding amino acid de-
hydrogenases (AADHs), natural amine dehydrogen-
ases (AmDHs), opine dehydrogenases (OpDHs) and
imine reductases( IREDs). In each case knowledge
of the structurea nd mechanism of the enzyme class
is addressed, with af urther description of the engi-
neering of those enzymes for the reductivea mination
of ketones towards primary anda lso secondary
amine products.

Moreover, an increasing amount of research is
being directedt owards the development of asymmet-
ric processes for reductive amination,[1,2] as,i nm any
cases,t he stereocentre bearing the amine is crucial in
determining its biological activity.E xamples of abiotic
asymmetric reductivea mination include organometal-
lic catalysis using different transitionm etal com-
plexes, such as ruthenium, rhodium and iridium, em-
ployinge ither H2
[3,4] or other reducing agents.[5] These
techniques have been extensively applied and are
well-established in industry.H owever, they also pres-
ent serious environmental and safety issues due to the
use of transitionm etals and hydrogeng as,f requently
under high pressures.O rganocatalytic approaches[6]
have also been employed using either hydrosilanes[7]
or Hantzsch esters[8] as the hydrogens ource,u tilising
chiral Brønsted acid species such as Akiyama–Terada
catalysts to induce chirality.
When the optical purityo fp roductsi so fp ara-
mounti mportance,t hen biocatalytic routes to these
compounds also command consideration.[9] Thel ist of
enzymest hat are used to catalyse the synthesiso f
chiral amines now stretches from hydrolases[10] for the
resolution of N-acylamines,t hrought of lavin-depen-
dent monoamine oxidases (MAOs) for the deracemi-
sation of chiral amines,[11] and w-transaminases (w-
TAs),[12] which are able to synthesise chiral amines
from ketones at the expense of an ammonia donor,
such as alanine or isopropylamine.T he last example
is interesting from the current perspective,i nt hat w-
TAsc atalyse formal reductivea mination reactions,a l-
thoughn or eductivec hemistry is involved. However,
despite many important examples of the application
of w-TAs in amine production, the enzymes have limi-
tationst hat are dictatedb yt heir mechanism.I n
at ransamination, ammoniaf rom the donor is trans-
ferredt ot he enzyme cofactor pyridoxal 5-phosphate
(PLP), which retainst he ammonia within the modi-
fied cofactorp yridoxamine 5-phosphate (PMP). The
ammonia is transferred to the co-substrateo ft he re-
action, in this case the prochiral ketone that will be
converted into an amine.O nly transfer of ammoniai s
permitted by this system, and, hence,t he syntheses
using transaminases are limited to the synthesiso fp ri-
mary amines.T he enzymatic preparation of chiral sec-
ondary amines has been achieved using MAOs,[11] al-
thougha racemica mine itself is the starting material.
Recenta dvances in imine reductase (IRED) biocatal-
ysis,[13,14,15] addressed below,a lso permit the prepara-
tion of chiral secondary amines from preformed pro-
chiral imines.H owever, in those cases,t he necessary

active in the conversion of glycine,a lanine,a spartic
acid, lysine andt ryptophan have also been report-
ed.[18] Thep otentialf or engineering these enzymes for
the reductive amination of ketones has been best real-
ised for the examples of LeuDH andP heDH.
2.1 Structure andM echanism of LeuDH
LeuDH( E.C.1.4.1.9) catalyses the reversible reduc-
tive amination of 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate (a-keto
isocaproate) 1 to leucine 2 (Scheme 3) andi sN ADH-
dependent.
Further activities towards a-ketobutyrate and a-ke-
tovalerate have been reported in homologues from
Bacillus sphaericus[23] and Bacillus stearothermophi-
lus.[24] Native LeuDHh as an established history in in-
dustrial biotransformations for the production of tert-
leucine,a ne ssential component of viralp rotease in-
hibitors.[25,26]
Thes tructureo ft he LeuDHh omologue from B.
sphaericus wasd eterminedb yR ice and co-workers
(PDB 1LEH).[27] One subunit of the enzyme is 364
amino acids andi so rganised into two domains sepa-
rated by ad eep cleft in which the cofactor binds (Fig-
ure 2A). In the crystal structure two subunits associ-
ate to form ad imer,b ut the quaternary structure of
LeuDHi st hought to be an octamer in solution. It
was thought that domain movements play ar ole in
catalysis,w ith ac losure of the domains in the pres-
ence of the substrate required to bring the cofactor
and substratess ufficiently close for hydride transfer.
Althought he authors report ac omplexw ith the co-
factor NAD(H), the atom coordinates for this mole-
cule are not contained within the relevant PDBf ile.
However, the report details the determinants of co-
factor binding within the binding cleft, and ac ompari-
son with the structures of phenylalanine dehydrogen-
ase (vide infra)b ound to both NAD(H) andp henyl-
alanine permits am odel to be constructed that places
both NAD(H) and l-leucine within the active site

creasedf rom 5.1 mM for the wild-type to 17 mM for
K80Q,b ut decreased slightly to 3.7 mM for K80A. Se-
kimotoa nd co-workers also determined that K80 acts
as ag eneral base in catalysis,m ost likely involved in
the activation of water for attack at the electrophilic
carbon of the imininum ion in the deamination direc-
tion. Them odel mayb ec onsidered in conjunction
with ap roposal for the oxidative deamination of leu-
cine put forward by Sekimoto and co-workers shown
in Figure 3.[28] Hydride abstraction from leucine (I) by
NAD++ first creates an iminiumi on (II). K80 actsa s

electrophilic carbon atom, to form the carbinolamine

Bommariusa nd co-workers targeted the determi-
nant residues of carboxylate recognition in aL euDH
from Bacillus stearothermophilus for mutation. Al-
thoughK 80 had to be retained, as it was essential for
the mechanism, as aturation mutagenesis library of
K68 yielded av ariant, K68M, that possessed low but
measurable reductivea mination activity towards
MIBK.[29] Other residues, homologous with those of
LeuDHf rom B. sphaericus illustrated in Figure 2B,
were targeted in am utagenesis strategy in which li-
braries of variants were screened for improved

tions to positions K68, D114 and V291, but also

factor NADH. Thes uperior variant overall was K68S/
E114V/N261L/V291C, which displayed a kcat value of
0.46 s@1 for the transformation of 3 to (R)-1,3-dime-
thylbutylamine (1,3-DMBA) 4 with 92.5% conversion
and 99.8% ee,a nd with negligible residual activity to-
wards l-leucine. Activityw as also recorded towards
other ketones,i ncluding cyclohexanone and acetophe-
none.
2.3 Structure andM echanism of PheDH
Furtherd evelopmentsi nt his area were achieved
throughe volution of another AADH, phenyalanine
dehydrogenase (PheDH, E.C.1.4.1.20) from Bacillus
badius,[30] which catalyses the interconversion of l-
phenylalanine and phenylpyruvate, again using
NADH as the cofactor.P heDH shares 48% sequence
identity with LeuDH,a nd as tructure of ab acterial
enzyme from Rhodococcus sp.M 4, upon which engi-
neering has been based, was determined by Holden,
Thoden and co-workers.[31,32] Thes tructurei sv ery sim-
ilar to that of LeuDH, consisting of two domains,s ep-
arated by al arge cleft.I nc ontrastt oL euDHh owev-
er, structures have been obtained in which both cofac-
tor and the substrates of amination and deamination
reactions,p henylpyruvatea nd l-phenylalanine
(1BW9,1 C1D)r espectively,p henyllactate (1C1X)
and an inhibitor, b-phenylpropionate (1BXG),h ave
been trapped in the active site.T he catalytic activity
of PheDHw as again believed to be enabled by ar ela-
tive closure of domains over the active site,i no rder
to bring the substrate and cofactor into sufficiently
close proximity for reaction.

residues,K 66 and K78, and also N262. However, ki-
netic measurements using the inhibitor 3-phenylpropi-
onate suggest that the interaction of the amino group
with D118 is not essential for substrate binding.[32]

identification of aw ater molecule in the structure, in

carbinolaminei ntermediate.T he mechanism in the
deamination direction wasd efineda s“ orderedb i-
ter”, in which binding of the cofactorN AD++ was fol-
lowed by that of l-Phe,f ollowed by ordered release
of ammonium ions,p henylpyruvatea nd NADH.
Detailedk inetic measurements led to am echanistic
proposalf or the deamination, which was similar to
that proposed for LeuDH (Figure 5),[32] although with
many refinements,e specially with respect to proton
transfer steps.I nt he first case,t he substrate is sug-
gested to bind in the zwitterionic form, with the
amine in the protonated state.K 78 activates the cata-
lytic water molecule for deprotonation of the ammo-
nium group (I), afterw hich hydride is transferred to
NAD++ (II)w ith formation of the iminiumi on (III).
K78 then activates waterf or attack at the iminium
carbon (III), giving the carbinolamine intermediate
(IV). K78n ow acts as ab ase,d eprotonating the carbi-
nolamine (V), as D118 donates ap roton to the amine
leaving group.T his leaves the phenylpyruvatep roduct
with its carbonyl group bound to the side chain of
K78 (VI)I ntriguingly, ac omparison of the structures
of PheDH in complexw ith phenyllactate and l-Phe
permitt he authors to propose am echanism whereby
the keto acid substrate of reductive amination is pre-
vented from beingr educed to phenyllactate by the co-
factor. In the phenyllactate complex, binding of the
keto group of the ligand to the side-chain of K78 posi-
tions the carbonyl carbon 5.1 cngstromf rom the C-4
of NAD(H), is too far for hydride deliveryt oo ccur
between them.

PheDH for reductive amination of ketones.[30] Starting
with the successfulL euDHm utations as ag uide,
aP heDH from Bacillus badius was mutated to give
the double variantK 77M/N276V,w hich displayed in-
creaseda ctivity towards MIBK over the wild-type
enzyme,b ut also for p-fluorophenylacetone.[30] Af o-
cused mutagenesis strategy, targeting these two posi-
tions furnished an improved variant K77S/N276L that
displayed a kcat value 15-fold greater than that ob-
served for the LeuDHa mine dehydrogenase mutant.
Then ew variant( F-AmDH) displayed reductivea mi-
nation activity towards ar ange of ketones including
phenoxy-2-propanone,2 -hexanone and 3-methyl-2-bu-
tanone.
Thet ransformation of p-fluorophenylacetone 5
gave the amine product with 93.8% conversion
(73.9% isolated yield) and >99.8% ee (Scheme5 ). F-
AmDH was also compatible with the NADH recy-
cling system of glucose and glucose dehydrogenase.
Further functionality in the newa mine dehydrogen-
ase scaffold was achieved by combiningt he N-termi-
nal section (residues 1–149) of the F-AmDH with res-
idues 140–166o ft he LeuDHv ariantt og ive ac himeric
enzyme,c FL1-AmDH that displayed activity towards
acetophenone anda damantyl methyl ketone,a nd con-
verted these to (R)-amine products with excellent
enantioselectivity.[33] In af urther refinement, two ad-
jacent asparagine residuesi nt he chimera, N270 and
N271, were mutated to leucine in an effortt oa ffect
amination activity.T he newv ariant displayed in-
creaseda n kcat value towards p-fluoroacetophenone.
Some of the lower activitieso fF -AmDH were at-
tributed to the poor solubility of substrates in aqueous
solution. This prompted the formulation of ab iphasic
reactions ystemi nw hich the enzyme operated in
a1 :4 ratio of heptane to water.[34] In such systems, the
volumetric productivity of the F-AmDH-catalysed
amination of p-fluorophenylacetonew as doubled.
In subsequent work by the group of Li, the Rhodo-
coccus sp.P heDH was evolved for the asymmetric re-
ductive amination of ketones.[35] In this report, the
structure of Rhodococcus sp.P heDH again suggested
that mutation of K66 and N262, known to interact
with the natural substrateRsc arboxylate group,c ould
be targeted in an effort to generate an enzyme that
transformed ketone substrates.A focused mutagenesis
strategyr esulted in at riple mutant enzyme,K 66Q/
S149G/N262C,w hich catalysed the amination of phe-
nylacetone 7 and 4-phenyl-2-butanone 9 to (R)-am-
phetamine 8 and (R)-1-methyl-3-phenylpropylamine
10 respectively, each with >98% ee (Scheme6 ).

the addition of mutation S149G wast hought to en-
large the size of the entrance to the substrate binding
pocket. The Rhodococcus sp.a mine dehydrogenase
also proved to be compatible with the glucose/glucose

verted to the (R)-amine 12 with an 82% isolated yield

2.5 Application of AmDHs in Cascades

cascade reactions with alcohol dehydrogenases
(ADHs) that permitt he conversion of alcohol sub-
strates into amine productsw ith “closed-loop” recy-
cling of the cofactor( Scheme 7).[38] In these experi-
ments,A DHs from either Aromatoleum aromaticum
or Lactobacillus brevis,w hich have stereocomplemen-
tary selectivities,w ere combined with the Bacillus
badius PheDH variantK 78S/N277L in ammonium
chloride buffera tp H8 .7,w ith an alcohol substrate
concentration of 20 mM and NAD++ cofactora t1 mM.
After 24 h, 85% conversion of the alcohol 13 to the
(R)-amine 8 was achieved, with >99% ee.
Thet echnique was applicable to aw ide range of 1-
phenyl-2-propanold erivatives.I nterestingly,t his “hy-
drogenb orrowing” systemp ermits the use of (S)-,
(R)- or racemic alcohol substrates, depending on
which ADH, or ac ombination of both, is used to cat-
alyse the alcohol oxidation.
As imilar cascade was later reported by Xu andc o-
workers.[39] In this case,a LeuDHh omologue from
Exiguobacterium sibiricum (EsLeuDH) was engi-
neered to contain equivalentm utations (K77S/
N270L)t ot hose engineered into the B. stearothermo-
philus LeuDHb yB ommariusa nd co-workers.[29] This
variantw as coupled with an ADH from Streptomyces
coelicolor that was selected on the basis of its lack of
stereoselectivity for racemic substrate alcohols. A
range of racemic alcohols,i ncluding 2-pentanol and
sec-phenylethanol, was converted to (R)-amine prod-
ucts with 94% and 21% conversion, respectively,a nd
in up to >99% ee.

3O pine Dehydrogenases and their in
vitro Evolution for the Reductive
Aminationo fK etones
Opine dehydrogenases (OpDHs,E .C.1.5.1.28)[41] are
ac lass of AADHs that catalyse the reversible reduc-
tive coupling of amino acid and keto acids to form N-
derivatised amino acids called opines.T he model re-
action catalysed by these enzymes in the BRENDA
database (http://www.brenda-enzymes.org) is the
NADH-dependent coupling of aminopentanoic acid
15 and pyruvate 16 into (2S)-2-{[1-(R)-carboxyethyl]-
amino}pentanoate 17 (Scheme 9). They can be found
in bacteria such as Agrobacterium,[42] where they can
be flavin dependent,a nd known to catalyse the for-
mation of opines that form in crown gallt umours in
infectedp lants,b ut also in higher organisms,s uch as
molluscsa nd sponges,i nw hich they are NAD(P)H-
dependent, anda re thought to have ar ole in main-
taining glycolytic flux during hypoxicc onditions.[43]
They have aroused interest for applications in prepa-
rative biocatalysis,a s, unusually amongst AADHs,
they are able to couple ac arbonylc ompound with an
amine that is larger than ammonia, with possible con-
sequences for the formationo fs econdary amines by
engineered variants.
3.1 Structure andM echanism of OpDHs
Thee nzyme from Arthrobacter sp.s train 1C was dis-
covered by Asanoa nd co-workers.[44] Thes ubstrate
N-[1-(R,S)-(carboxyl)ethyl]-S-phenylalanine 19
(Scheme 9) was useda sa ne nrichment substrate and
experiments yielded the Arthrobacter strains from
which the enzyme was successfully purified.
Thee nzyme –C ENDH –c atalysed the formation
of 19 from l-phenylalanine, sodium pyruvate and
NADH as cofactor.O ther hydrophobic l-amino acids
including l-methionine,w ere tolerated as substrates,
as well as d-leucine,a lthoughw ith only 3.4% of the
activity observed with l-Met. Using l-Met as the
amino acid substrate,t he enzyme also accepted keto
acids such as oxaloacetate and, to al essere xtent
glyoxylate.S ubsequent cloning of the gene revealed
that it encoded ap olypeptide of 359 amino acids.[45]
Thes tructure of the enzyme was determined by
Asano,R ice and co-workers,[46] and, in common with
some other AADHs,r evealed at wo-domains tructure
with ac left at the interface in which the nicotinamide
cofactorw as observed. Further information has been
obtained from as tructureo ft he relatedO pDH, octo-
pine dehydrogenase,f rom the great scallop Pecten
maximus (Figure 6A), as separate complexes have
been obtained with the amino acids arginine and also
pyruvate.[47] Thesec omplexes have been used, along
with NMR[48] andI TC measurements,[49] to begin to
describe am echanism for OpDH activity.
In the l-arginine complex, among other interac-
tions,t he alpha-carboxylate is bound to H212;t he
guanidinium group to the side-chaino fE 142 (Fig-
ure 6B).[47] As these residues stem from the different
domains it is thought that l-arginineb inding stimu-
lates ar elativec losure of the domains to prime the
enzyme for the coupling reaction. In the pyruvate

from the NADH cofactor, meaning that reductiono f
pyruvate to lactate is not observed. Mutation of Q118
to alanine gave av arianto fm arkedlyr educeda ctivity.
As equential binding order for these two substrates
was proposedb ased on these observations.A super-
impositiono f l-arginine and pyruvate complexes re-
veals little difference in the orientation of Q118 and
H212 and permits observation of the two ligands in
their binding modes (Figure 6B). However, each
ligand is somewhat distant from the nicotinamide ring
of the NADPH cofactor, suggesting that the active
conformation, in which the imine bondb etween the
substrate partners is reducedb yh ydride from the C4
atom of that ring, must incorporate different ligand
binding modes.
Further evidence for the sequential, orderedb ind-
ing of l-argininea nd pyruvate came from NMR stud-
ies.[48] By monitoring five randomly selected peaks in
15N-1H-TROSY spectra of 15Nl abelled apo-protein, it
was observedt hat the binding of NADH resulted in
perturbations to these chemical shifts. Further pertur-
bations were observed upon the addition of l-arginine
to ap re-formed OpDH-NADHc omplex, but not
when pyruvate wasa dded to the same.T his was
strongly suggestive of l-arginine as the second sub-
strate,a fter NADH, to bind in the OpDH coupling
reaction. Additional support for the mechanism was
providedb yi sothermal calorimetry studies,[49] which
again showedm easurable enthalpy changes upont he
addition of l-arginine to the OpDH-NADHc omplex,
but no binding when the same complex was presented
with pyruvate. Interestingly,t he order of “amine” and
“ketone”p artner binding in this reductive amination
is therefore reversed from that which is observed in
LeuDHa nd PheDH. However, although each of
these experiments on OpDH sheds light on the bind-
ing order of substrates in the OpDH mechanism, no
description of the chemical mechanism and the role
of individual amino acid side-chains has been report-
ed at this stage.
3.2 Application of OpDH
Following the discoveryo ft he OpDH from Arthro-
bacter sp.s train 1C,t his wasa pplied to the prepara-
tive formation of as econdary amine carboxylic acid
by Asano and co-workers.[50] In addition to its native
substrates, l-phenyalanine and pyruvate,s hortc hain
neutral amino acids including (S)-enantiomers of 2-
aminobutyric acid, norvaline, norleucine and phenyl-
glycinew ere accepted as the amino acid partner sub-
strate,w ith yields of between 96 and >99%, although
(S)-methionine was preferred. Interestingly (S)-phe-
nylalaninol, with no carboxylate group,w as also con-
verted quantitatively by the enzyme,a ne arlyi ndica-
tion of the promiscuous activity of the enzyme for

acid were accepted in addition to pyruvic acid as keto
acceptors.

pentanoic acid 21,b ut also to the non-carboxylated 1-

tive amination of cyclohexanone,2 -pentanone and 2-

4I mineR eductases (IREDs) and their
Application in ReductiveA mination
Reactions
Imine reductases( IREDs)[13,14,15] were first reported
to catalyse the NADPH-dependenta symmetric reduc-
tion of cyclic imines to form chiral amine productsb y
Mitsukura and co-workers.[52,53] Twoe nzymes,f rom
different strains of Streptomyces,c atalysed the reduc-
tion of the model imine 2-methyl-1-pyrroline 28
(Scheme 11), with complementary enantioselectivity.
In the last five years manyo ther IREDs have been
isolated anda pplied to the asymmetric reductiono f
ar ange of prochiral cyclic imines.
4.1 Structure of IREDs
IREDsh ave been shown[54,55,56] to possess ad imeric
structure in which one monomer of approximately
30 kDa is intimately associated with its partner to
form an active site through domains haring. The
active site is found at the interface of the N-terminal
Rossman fold of one monomer,a nd the C-terminal
bundleo fi ts neighbour (Figure 8A). Thet wo domains
of each monomer are connected by al ong inter-
domainh elix, and the dimer structure is thought to be
flexible throughout the reactionc oordinate,w ith sig-
nificantc losure observed between domains upon sub-
strate binding. Thes tructures of IREDs are most sim-
ilar to those of hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenases
(HIBDHs), typifiedb yP DB code 2CVZ,[57] although
domains haring is not observed in the latter enzymes.
In HIBDHs, ac atalytic lysine in the active site is
thought to protonate the nascenta lcohol in the reduc-
tive direction.[57] When the structures of HIBDHsa nd
IREDsa re superimposed, the lysine of 2CVZ is ob-
served to overlap with different residues according to
the IREDs tudied,b eing in some cases aspartica cid
or tyrosine.A role for these residues in protonation
of amine productsi nI RED-catalysed reactions has
been suggested,[54,58] andi ndeed their mutation to ala-
nine leads to enzymes of poor activity,a lthough their
role in mechanism hasy et to be confirmed by struc-
tural studies.Ar ecent structure of the IRED from
Amycolatopsiso rientalis is the first in which the
amine product (R)-1-methyl-tetrahydroisoquinoline
(R-MTQ) has been observed in the presenceo ft he
cofactor( Figure 8B).[59]
In this complex, the active site is indeed more
closed than has previouslyb een observedi no ther
IREDss tructures determinedi nt he absence of
al igand, and the amine makes bonding interactions
with residue side-chains in the active site including
Y179 and N241. This complex is at least suggestive of
ar ole for these residues in liganda nchoring, and
places the electrophilic carbon of the amine within
as uitable distance of the C-4 of the nicotinamide ring
of NADPH for hydride exchange.T he ligand is some-
what distant from the pendant asparagine residue
N171 that is the structural equivalento ft he catalytic
lysine in HIBDH however, so the significance of the
residue in this position, at least for the reduction of
pre-formed iminesb yI REDs, remains unclear.

ap re-formed imine 30 that had formed owing to the
large excess of amine in the reactionm edium.
Nonetheless,t he principle of IREDs being applied

tion reactions in which an IREDf rom Streptosporan-
gium roseum was challenged with benzaldehydei n
the presence of ammonia, methylamine or aniline.[60]
While reaction rates were slow with one equivalent of
the amine,a ni ncrease to 10 or 50 equivalents gave,
for example,a 73% conversion of benzylaldehyde and
methylamine to N-methylbenzylamine after 8h in the
latter case.A cetophenone andc yclohexylacetone
were coupled with methylamine to givea mine prod-
ucts with 39% and 53% conversion and 87% and
78% ee,r espectively.I ne ach case a5 0-fold excess of
amine was required, and improved conversions were
obtained at pH 9.0, favouring imine formation. NMR
studies suggested that the IRED was very effective at
drawing the imine intermediate from solution, as no
imine intermediate in the conversion of acetophenone
was detected.
Thet heme of IRED-catalysed asymmetric reduc-
tive amination was continued by the group at Roche,
who had initially described al argef amily of IREDs,
with complementarys electivity,c ompetent for the
asymmetric reductiono fc yclici mines.[61] This library

nations of acetophenone determinedt ob el ow-yield-
ing. Twoo ft he superior IREDs, RIR_11Q and RIR_20Q

verted ketone 31 and methylamine to 32 in 71% yield

conversion of 31 anda mmonia to 33 in 50% yield and
with 94% de In addition,I R_20 catalysed the reduc-
tive amination of 34 with methylamine to form 35
with 55% yield and9 6% ee In each case the amine
was suppliedi n1 2.5 molar equivalents andt he reac-

imine formation. Low activitiesw ere again attributed
to the lowi nstance of imine formation in aqueous so-
lution,a nd again, littleo rn one of the imine inter-
mediates was detectableu sing NMR.

5C onclusions
RReductivea minasesQ wouldb ea considerable and
potenta ddition to the current portfolio of enzymes
available for the preparation of optically active
amines.R ecent research suggests that there may be
numerous routes to the discovery of such activities,
from the engineering of extant amino acid dehydro-
genases, including opine dehydrogenases,t hrough to
the discoveryo fn atural amine dehydrogenases,a nd
the recruitment of imine reductases. In some cases,
the mechanisticb asis for the reductivea minationr e-
action is clear; in others the role of the enzyme in the
reductivea mination process must be further investi-
gated. These studies will help to inform the further
engineering of reductive aminase activity for broad-
ened substrate scope,a nd also for process suitability,
so that the enzymes might be applied in the industrial
synthesiso fc hiral amines.
