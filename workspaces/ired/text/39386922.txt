ABSTRACT: Saturated N-heterocycles constitute a vital scaffold for pharmaceutical chemistry but are challenging to access
synthetically, particularly asymmetrically. Here, we demonstrate how imine reductases can achieve annulation through tandem inter-
and intramolecular reductive amination processes. Imine reductases were used in combination with further enzymes to access
unsubstituted, α-substituted, and α,α′-disubstituted N-heterocycles from simple starting materials in one pot and under benign
conditions. This work shows the remarkable flexibility of these enzymes to have broad activity against numerous substrates derived
from singlular starting materials.
KEYWORDS: imine reductase, reductive aminase, cyclization, N-heterocycles

INTRODUCTION
With half of all FDA-approved pharmaceuticals containing
saturated N-heterocycles, improved methods for their synthesis
are essential (Figure 1a).
1
Current approaches, with limitations
around stereochemical control through to sp
3
C−H function-
alization, limit access to diverse scaffolds. One specific challenge
is N-alkylation, with methods such as reductive amination and
nucleophilic substitution resulting in overalkylation and poor
atom economy while depending on unsustainable reagents.
2,3
Recently, borrowing hydrogen catalysis has seen application in
the synthesis of saturated N-heterocycles through N-alkylation
of amines with terminal diols; however, amine coupling partners
have typically been limited to benzylamine and aniline
derivatives.
4−6
To access α-substituted N-heterocycles, diol
substrates containing a secondary alcohol would permit
retention or generation of a stereocenter. Although this has
been demonstrated asymmetrically, the scope remains limited to
few examples employing benzylamines, with reports proceeding
with poor chemoselectivity.
7,8
While intramolecular hydro-
amination offers an alternative route to these scaffolds, recent
research has focused on C−H substitution at this position.
Traditionally, this transformation has been performed using
low-temperature lithiation chemistry,
9
but modern methods
have achieved it under preferable conditions by utilizing
transition metal
10−12
and photoredox catalysis (Figure
1b).
13,14
Although synthesis of di-α-substituted heterocycles
has been achieved through double reductive amination of
diketone compounds,
15
with key examples described in total and
iminosugar syntheses,
16,17
a general asymmetric catalytic
platform is yet to be disclosed. Instead, strategies that prioritize
redox-neutral cyclization chemistry (i.e., Paal-Knorr) followed
by a global reduction are often preferred,
18
despite the
associated challenges in stereocontrol.
Biocatalysis has emerged as a robust platform for synthesis.
19
It possesses distinct advantages over traditional synthetic
reagents, such as operation under benign conditions, catalyst
complementarity, excellent stereoselectivity, and no require-
ments for protecting groups. This potential has been realized
most in amine synthesis, with multiple pharmaceutical process
methods described, including contributions from Merck,
20
GSK,
21
Pfizer,
22,23
Novartis,
24
and others.

26
and imine reductases
(IREDs)
27
provide options for setting stereocenters in
preformed N-heterocycles, cyclization through N-alkylation by
a single enzyme has been long unfeasible due to known options
such as transaminases (TAs)
28
and amine dehydrogenases
(AmDHs)
29
being limited solely to primary amination. In 2017,
an imine reductase subclass (reductive aminases, RedAms)
capable of catalyzing full aqueous reductive amination was
reported.
30
This synthetic potential has since been realized
through industrial application in the synthesis of several drug
candidates on a process scale.
25
One-pot cascade reactions showcase the potential of
biocatalysts for their synthesis. This has been exemplified in
heterocycle synthesis, where TA-IRED combinations have
generated saturated N-heterocycles from dicarbonyl sub-
strates.
31−33
Recent metagenomic IRED panels have also
increased the number of applications of these enzymes in
cascades.
34,35
This includes setting stereocenters following
cyclization,
36−39
N-alkylation with redox surrogate reagents
through a hydrogen borrowing approach,
40
and combination
with alcohol oxidase or carboxylic acid reductase for N-alkylated
products.
41
Recent work also demonstrated the combination of
chemoenzymatic approaches with amine oxidases,
42
and the use
of aldolases to synthesize aminopolyols.
43
There has also been
disclosure of multifunctional biocatalysts that simultaneously
mediated several synthetic steps in one go.
44
Herein, we further
demonstrate this multifunctional ability of IREDs to form N-
heterocycles through a sequential inter−intramolecular reduc-
tive amination ring closure approach in the first report of these
specific types of transformations (Figure 1c). This approach
showcases the multifunctionality of RedAms,
44
with the
biocatalyst operating on two individual substrates derived
from the starting material in a one-pot cascade fashion.
■
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Oxidation-IRED Cascades. In a previous paper describing
the engineering of AcCO6, we noted a general trend of high
specific activity for terminal diol substrates.
45
Inspired by this,
we sought to compare our enzyme cascades to the chemical
borrowing hydrogen literature, which inspired us to pursue a
biocatalytic equivalent to the reported diol annulation
chemistry. While alcohol oxidases have been previously applied
to the oxidation of diols,
46
access to the dialdehyde is often
limited by overoxidation or the interception of intermediate
hemiacetal tautomers to form lactones (Scheme 1).

Initial analytical scale biotransformations analyzed by GC-MS
showed no presence of carboxylic acids or δ-valerolactone 2
when 1,5-pentanediol 3 was subjected to oxidation by AcCO
6
,
although glutaraldehyde 5 was also unobserved. We next sought
to test the coupling of 3 with allylamine v under the standard
AcCO
6
−RedAm cascade conditions outlined previously,
41
with
the better expressing “AdRedAm” used in lieu of “AspRedAm”.
Unfortunately, we observed no product from this biotransfor-
mation. Hypothesizing that perhaps the intermediate hemiacetal
intermediate tautomer 1 may be intercepted and oxidized by the
glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) enzyme “CDX-901” required
for cofactor recycling, we measured the specific activity of CDX-
901 cell-free extract (CFE) with 5-hydroxypentanal 4 through
an NADPH formation assay. The CDX-901 CFE was found to
be active toward the oxidation of 4 and was replaced with the
GDH fromThermoplasma acidophilum(TaGDH).
48
The side
activity was not confirmed as being due to CDX-901 itself or
another enzyme present in the crude preparation. To our
delight, when the biotransformation was repeated with TaGDH,
we observed the formation of 1-allylpiperidine 3v. We speculate
that 5 was not observed due to its known role as an enzyme
cross-linking reagent and that without further reaction it may
simply cross-link enzymes involved in its formation. This clearly
demonstrated the versatility of this class of enzyme, mediating
two distinct reductive amination reactions, first using a primary
amine donor and then a secondary amine donor. The
bifunctionality was of interest, leading us to probe the reaction
pathway, given the number of potential reaction partners
(Scheme 1). The potential intermediate N-allyl-5-hydroxypen-
tan-1-amine 4v was synthesized and subjected alongside 4 to an
oxidase activity screen as outlined previously.
45
As 4 was shown
to be a substrate for AcCO
6
while 4v was not (shown in red), we
concluded that “Route A” was the mechanism by which the
heterocycle was formed. Following this, we sought to establish
the product scope for this cascade reaction.
Initially, a panel of diol substrates was subjected to activity
screening (see Supporting Information). Alongside previously
tested aliphatic diols, diethylene glycol and N-methyl-diethanol-
amine were screened to investigate whether the methodology
may be applied to form morpholines and piperazines. While
diethylene glycol and N-methyl-diethanolamine were moder-
ately active substrates for the engineered and wild-type choline
oxidases, respectively, applying them under IRED- cascade
conditions suggested no product formation by GC-MS analysis.
Despite this, correct masses for heterocyclic products were
successfully detected from the panel of aliphatic diols (Table 1).
While the formation of saturated heterocycles was observed for
6−8 membered rings, 1,4-butanediol 7 largely yielded products
of mass consistent with pyrroles, possibly through a Paal-Knorr
reaction. Incubating 9 with a primary amine and lone AcCO6
did not yield a possible pyrrole product, indicating the
involvement of the IRED in this transformation. Both N-
methylpyrrolidine 7iii and N-methylpiperidine 3iii were
undetected by GC-MS, but we speculate this is due to

coretention with the solvent due to the low boiling point. While
the majority of products were observed as single peaks in GC
chromatograms, no reaction conversions are claimed due to the
potential for undetectable side reactions such as enzyme cross-
coupling. Our attention then turned to the synthesis of α-
substituted N-heterocycles. 5-Oxohexanol 13 and 6-oxohepta-
nol 14 were synthesized and found to be substrates for AcCO6.
Subjecting these substrates to conditions identical to those
utilized in the terminal diol work yielded a range of asymmetric
heterocycles (Table 1). Where possible, ee and absolute
configuration were determined using chiral GC-FID, although
these assignments are largely limited due to challenges in
achieving the separation of nonderivitizable products and
accessing enantiomerically pure standards. The use of aryl
ketones 15 and 16 yielded enamine substrates, with AdRedAm
unable to mediate the reduction of the more stable conjugated
intermediate. Chemical reduction of these substrates still
enabled a synthetic approach to 2-aryl substituted saturated
N-heterocycles, but not in the same fashion as described above
(see Supporting Information).
Following the establishment of the product scope, our
attention moved to synthesis on a preparative scale. Through
using a calibration curve, we were able to determine conditions
that would yield piperidines and azepanes with high conversion,
although we were not able to produce pyrroles or azocanes at
conversions that were synthetically useful. Preparative scale
reactions were performed on a 1 mmol scale with N-heterocycle
products isolated by distillation (Scheme 2). Preparative scale
synthesis was again performed on a 1 mmol scale on keto-
alcohol precursor 13, with (S)-N-cyclopropyl-2-methylpiper-
idine 13i isolated in good yield and ee following distillation.
IRED-Mediated Diketone Cyclization. We next sought to
extend the approach to disubstituted N-heterocycles, specifically
the synthesis of N-alkylated 2,5-disubstituted pyrrolidines from
1,4-diketones via a three-step one-pot cascade catalyzed solely
by an IRED. Initially, AdRedAm afforded N-methylpyrrolidine
21iii in good to high conversions (>80%) from 2,5-decadione
and methylamine, with no pyrrole formation observed.
However, low diastereomeric ratios were observed under all
conditions tested. The reactions also did not prove amicable
toward scaling, with byproducts consistently observed.
In an attempt to improve the stereochemical outcome, 30
IREDs were selected from a metagenomic panel and screened
against two 1,4-diketone substrates (21 and 22) and four amine
partners (i, iii, v, vi) (see Supporting Information for complete
set of IREDs and screening results).
35
As a result, we were
pleased to obtain all eight N-alkylated 2,5-dissubstituted
pyrrolidines from the combination of the two diketones and
four amines evaluated, in good to high conversions within 24 h
(Table 2).
To our surprise, the proposed cascade also allowed us to
access both cis and trans pyrrolidines in good to excellent
diastereo- and enantioselectivities, dependent on the biocatalyst
utilized. These results show that some IREDs retain absolute
enantiopreference in both steps, affording trans products (e.g.,
2S,5S-21i from IR23), while others switch selectivity to afford
the cis products (e.g., 2S,5R-21i from IR49). These findings
indicate that the substrate binding modes differ broadly among
the evaluated IREDs and the acyclic−cyclic imine intermediates.
Furthermore, access to both diastereoisomers suggests that the
diastereoselectivity is primarily governed by the enzyme and not
chemically dictated by the previously defined stereocenter.
Our proposed route assumed that the first reductive
amination step occurs exclusively at the less hindered ketone
moiety (Route A, Scheme 3a). To test this hypothesis, we
evaluated four ketones (23−26, Scheme 3b) of analogous
hindrances and electronic effects to the bulkier side of our
diketones. None of the phenyl ketones (24−26) underwent
reductive amination (see Supporting Information), implying
that for diketone 22, the cascade occurs exclusively through
Route A (Scheme 3a). Conversely, amine products were
observed when using pentyl ketone 23 as the substrate,
indicating that Route B could occur simultaneously with
Route A for reactions using diketone 21. However, despite the
presence of products, low conversions (10−30%) were
obtained, which when combined with the fact that the selected
IREDs showed high diastereo- and excellent enantioselectivies
(Table 2), led us to conclude that Route A is the fastest, and
most likely, the sole pathway followed in reactions using
diketone 21.
Finally, to demonstrate the synthetic applicability of the
investigated cascade, a series of preparative-scale syntheses were
performed. Attempts to intensify reactions were unsuccessful,
and consequently, the same conditions used on the analytical
scale were applied for the preparative-scale reactions. Using our
three-step one-enzyme cascade, six N-alkylated 2,5-disubsti-
tuted pyrrolidines were successfully synthesized on a 0.3 mmol
scale (Scheme 4). Both diastereoisomers of pyrrolidines 21i
were synthesized with excellent enantioselectivities and good
yields within 24 h, but 72 h was required for most other
substrates. Typically, full substrate consumption was observed
after 24 h and the enamine intermediate/byproduct was
observed along with the desired product, followed solely by
production of the desired product in the following 24−48 h.
■
CONCLUSIONS
The work presented here has demonstrated the bifunctionality
of a series of wild-type IREDs, able to catalyze multiple reductive
aminations in a cascade sequence derived from the same starting
materials. We have expanded the biocatalytic reaction toolbox
through the demonstration of IRED-catalyzed annulation
reactions and have demonstrated how enzyme engineering
may influence catalysis with the first alcohol oxidase capable of
generating dialdehydes with complete chemoselectivity.
Through applying these enzymes in combination, four distinct
synthetic steps were achieved within one pot, and trans-
formations previously unique to precious metal-catalyzed
borrowing hydrogen chemistry requiring forcing conditions

The ability to form α-substituted heterocycles is a trans-
formation underrepresented in heterogeneous catalysis, and
here we demonstrate it with stereocontrol. Finally, by extending
this work to the synthesis of N-alkylated α,α-disubstituted
pyrrolidines from simple diketone starting materials, we have
demonstrated a remarkable ability of these biocatalysts to build
complexity with complete diastereomeric control. While there
are limits to the synthetic application of our methodology, the
recent expansion of our imine reductase panel demonstrated in
the diketone cascade and the potential for the engineering of
these enzymes toward this chemistry presents enormous
potential. With the unprecedented speed with which IREDs
have moved from discovery to industrial application, we are
hopeful that this novel methodology may achieve a similar
impact.
