Biocatalytic imine reduction has been a topic of intens e research by the artificial metalloenzyme community
in recent years. Artificial construc ts, together with natural enzymes, ha ve been engineered to produce chiral
amines with high enantioselectivity. This review exami nes the design of the main classes of artificial imine
reductases reported thus far and summarises approach es to enhancing their catalytic performance using
complementary methods. Examples of utilising these biocatalysts in vivoor in multi-enzyme cascades have
demonstrated the potential that artIREDs can oﬀer, ho wever, at this time their use in biocatalysis remains
limited. This review explores the current scope of artIR EDs and the strategies used for catalyst improvement,
and examines the potential for artIREDs in the future.
Introduction
Biocatalysis remains an attractive target, capable of achieving
high chemo-, regio- and enantio-selectivities under milder
conditions than those required for traditional organometallic
catalysis.
1,2 The preparation of chiral amines is a highly desirable
target for biocatalysis. The enantioselective reduction of imines
represents one key pathway to achieving some of these inter-
mediates/products. Naturally-occurring enzymes capable of the
asymmetric reduction of imine bonds in synthetic substrates
were only relatively recently reported by Mitsukura et al. in
2010.
4 Subsequently, the use of bioinformatics to scan large
databases of enzymes has led to the discovery and development
of many imine reductases (IREDs). 5 IREDs have been screened
for a large number of imine substrates, gradually expanding the
known substrate scope of these enzymes. While substantial
progress in the field of enzyme engineering, such as the
technique of directed evolution, has led to the faster develop-
ment of other enzymes optimised for target substrates and
conditions,
3,6 with a few notable exceptions, 7,8 IREDs have
received relatively little attention.
In vitroevolution has allowed the improvement of some IREDs
to enable industrial biocatalysis.9 Rational improvement, in con-
trast, is often hampered by a limited understanding of the

determinants of mechanism or stereoselectivity. 5 It has proven
diﬃcult to predict if an IRED is ( R)- or ( S)-selective, with
some enzymes switching selectivity under diﬀerent external
conditions,10 suggesting the determinants of selectivity are
extremely complex. Several IREDs have, in addition, been
reported to display product inhibition,
11 a common problem
of natural enzymes, which can be solved by feeding strategies,
but this requires more specialised experimental set-ups. Other
concerns, which include a still limited substrate scope,
5 poor
long-term stability,12 high cost of development and the need for
expensive cofactors, such as NADH/NADPH 12–14 suggest that
complementary approaches to natural metalloenzyme discov-
ery are merited for imine reduction.
Even before the discovery of natural IREDs, artificial metal-
loenzymes (ArMs), formed of a reactive metal catalytic centre
within a protein scaﬀold, were designed to target imine
reduction.
15 The thought behind this design is to combine
the diverse reaction scope of synthetic organometallic catalysts
with selectivity influenced by a secondary coordination sphere
from the protein scaﬀold. 16 The incorporation of an organo-
metallic complex inside a protein has several potential benefits
including (i) compatibility with milder conditions, as for nat-
ural enzymes,
17,18 (ii) protection from inactivation by external
factors such as thiols, water and oxygen, 19,20 (iii) increased rates
of catalysis, 21,22 and (iv) improved enantioselectivity from the
presence of an extensive and complex secondary coordination
sphere that would otherwise be extremely challenging to
achieve synthetically. 23,24 The organometallic catalysts used
for these artificial imine reductases (artIREDs) tend to use
formate in place of the more expensive nicotinamide cofactors
as a source of hydride for the reduction.
25–27 The design of
ArMs also allows two complementary methods for optimising
performance as not only can the steric and electronic properties
of the organometallic catalyst be optimised but also the protein
scaffold.
28,29
Although results so far are promising, artIREDs are yet to
demonstrate improved selectivity or activity compared to more
established chemical reduction methods. 30,31 The range of
accessible products is also limited by the stability of the imine
substrates in aqueous conditions necessary for the stability of
the protein scaﬀold. Cyclic imines tend to be stable in such
conditions, but more hydrolytically labile noncyclic imines are
much less so, limiting the types of amine intermediates that
can be produced. Amongst natural enzymes, reductive amina-
tion has received more interest compared with imine reduction
as it is a method of accessing a wider range of secondary and
tertiary amines from cheap and readily accessible ketone and
amine precursors.
11
Reports of the use of artIREDs in enzyme cascades, in vivo
catalysis that removes the need for protein extraction and
purification and potential biomedical applications, present
exciting future directions for some of these designs. However,
the greatest value in this research to date is the contribution to
our understanding of the design of ArMs and the development
of new methods and techniques for enhancing catalytic perfor-
mance and selectivity. Much of the work reviewed in this article
examines imine reduction as a tool to demonstrate progress,
with the reduction of commercially available substrates, such
as 1a–5a (Fig. 1), commonly used as benchmark reactions to
examine performance of the artIREDs. In addition, enantio-
merically pure salsolidine ( 1b), and other isoquinolines, are
valuable as biologically active alkaloids.
32
There are multiple considerations in designing an artificial
metalloenzyme; primarily the selection of a suitable protein.
Over 80 diﬀerent proteins have been used for the construction
of ArMs and engineered to catalyse a huge variety of synthetic
reactions, covered in a recent comprehensive review
33 and
recorded in an online database (https://amp.ward-lab.ch/), pro-
duced and maintained by the Ward group. Likewise, we guide
interested readers towards detailed reviews in the areas of
natural IREDs
2,10,34 and synthetic organometallic imine
reduction catalysts, 30,31,35 to avoid covering the same ground
here. This review surveys the design of artIREDs and the and
evolution strategies employed to improve their performance.

Scaﬀolds
Streptavidin
The streptavidin design exploits the high binding aﬃnity of
the protein, derived from Streptomyces avidinii, for the small
molecule biotin. The non-covalent anchoring strategy is
achieved by connecting an organometallic catalyst to biotin
by a short linker, either from the bidentate ligand of the
catalyst (Fig. 2a)
15 or from the arene ligand (Fig. 2b). 36 This
cofactor spontaneously binds irreversibly to streptavidin. Dual
anchoring has also been attempted with biotin attached to the
arene ligand and a coordinating histidine residue incorporated
near the site of the metal in the place of either S112 or K121
(Fig. 2c).
37
Initially, several organometallic transfer hydrogenation cat-
alysts were screened for the reduction of imine 1a.A Z5-Cp*Ir
piano-stool complex was found to perform best even though
the Z6-(arene)Ru complex had previously proven best for ketone
reduction.28 This catalyst was then incorporated into the ArM
by linking a bidentate ligand of the metal complex to biotin via
an aryl sulfonamide group. The biotinylated cofactor, which
shows no enantioselectivity in the absence of the protein
scaﬀold, when incorporated into wild-type streptavidin (Sav)
resulted in a catalyst that furnished the ( R)-enantiomer of
salsolidine, 1b with 57% e.e.
15 X-ray crystal structures of several
streptavidin (Sav) ArMs revealed that the enantioselectivity is
partly derived from the configuration of the metal complex
bound in the active site. It was hypothesised that the structure
of the protein determined which enantiomer of the synthetic
cofactor bound, despite a racemic mixture of the cofactor
being added. This design has been extensively investigated,
primarily by the Ward group, with successful optimisation
strategies achieving high selectivity on a range of trial sub-
strates (Table 1).
Ribonuclease S
An a-helical peptide unit can be cleaved from ribonuclease A by
subtilisin to leave an S-shaped protein, ribonuclease S, from
which the ArM is formed through assembly with a small
synthetic a-helical peptide. This non-covalent assembly is
achieved spontaneously on combining the S-protein with the
synthetic peptide in a buﬀer solution at 37 1C.
38 The synthetic
peptide can be engineered to include coordinating amino acid
linkers, either natural or non-natural, to bind a metal ion or
complex. Incorporation of this metallated synthetic peptide
with the S-protein results in the formation of the ArM (Fig. 3).
Early studies introduced Hg(
II)39 and Cu( II)40 ions, but applying
this design for a transfer hydrogenase was not attempted until
recently.
This design has received only brief attention compared to
the streptavidin–biotin model. Multiple transition metal piano-
stool complexes were investigated, with IrCp* proving the most
successful, with modest rate acceleration on incorporation into
the protein scaffold compared to the free metal catalyst.
Genetic optimization was attempted via rational design where
three residues lying in close proximity to the metal ion were
selected for mutagenesis, however, the triple mutant afforded
no enhanced catalytic performance.
38 Overall, the best enantio-
meric excess achieved was only 39% for ( S)-1b (Table 1). 33

Carbonic anhydrase
Carbonic anhydrase II (CAII) was selected as a suitable scaﬀold
as it is a stable monomeric protein that can be easily expressed
in high yields in E. coli.
41 A Zn( II) ion lies at the base of a
hydrophobic, cone-shaped cavity and has been shown to bind
tightly to aryl-sulfonamides.41,42 By linking a bidentate ligand to
an aryl-sulfonamide group, a Ir-pi ano stool catalyst was incorpo-
rated inside the scaﬀold (Fig. 4).42 To start with, a narrow range of
IrCp* organometallic catalysts was incorporated into a small group
of CAII variants. The most successful artIRED constructed with
wild-type CAII performed the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation
1a to (S)-1b at 70% e.e. with a catalyst loading of 8.75 mol%.
Periplasmic binding protein
An artIRED, designed by the Duhme-Klair group,
43 takes inspira-
tion from an iron-uptake mechanism of microorganisms that
secrete small Fe(
III) chelating molecules ca lled siderophores. The
p a t h w a yi n v o l v e st h ec a p t u r eo fF e (III)-siderophore chelates by
their cognate periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) to aid their
transport to the inner membrane and into the cytoplasm of the
cell. By anchoring an organometa llic catalyst to azotochelin, a
tetradentate siderophore, this catalyst can be incorporated into
t h eP B Pi nt h ep r e s e n c eo fF e (
III)( F i g .5 a ) .
A key feature of this design is that the binding of this
catalyst-siderophore conjugate (Fig. 5b) with the PBP can be
reversed by controlling the oxidation state of the Fe cation.
While Fe(
III) binds tightly to the siderophore and the complex is
strongly bound to the PBP, reduction of Fe( III) to Fe( II) results in
a less thermodynamically stable and more kinetically labile
complex that readily dissociates, releasing Fe(
II).44,45 Oxidation
of Fe( II) back to Fe( III) triggers reassembly of the artIRED with-
out aﬀecting enantioselectivity, allowing recovery and recycling
of the costly protein and replacement of the synthetic catalyst
in the case of catalyst degradation (Fig. 5c).
Initial work led to a [Cp*Ir(pyridinesulfonamide)Cl] complex
that significantly outperformed the more commonly used ami-
noethylsulfonamide ligand for the reduction of 1a under mildly
acidic conditions tolerated by the protein. The Ir catalyst
performed at a rate around 20-fold slower once bound inside
the PBP scaﬀold but produced moderate selectivity for ( R)-1b
with an e.e. of 35% (Table 1). The crystal structure revealed that
H227 was positioned in close proximity to Ir, indicating a
dual anchoring system. This suggested that H227 binds to
iridium and may sterically impede the binding of hydride

required for the catalytic reaction. While replacement of H227
with non-coordinating alanine did improve the activity of the
artIRED, although still not to the level of the free Ir catalyst, it
led to a marked drop in enantioselectivity.
Optimisation and development
strategies
The design of ArMs gives two complementary methods for
optimising performance, through tuning the organometallic
cofactor and by adapting the secondary coordination sphere
provided by the protein. There have been multiple approaches
to optimising both of these components.
Optimising the chemical component
The organometallic catalyst can be tuned, both through the
metal and the coordinating ligands. Examples of exchanging
the type of metal used are usually covered in the initial design
of these ArMs. Work by Du¨rrenberger et al.,
15 which established
the streptavidin–biotin design for imine reduction, investigated
several catalysts including complexes of ruthenium, rhodium
and iridium, with a IrCp* catalyst proving most successful,
although arene-linked rhodium complexes have also received
attention.
36,37 Initial work on the Ribonuclease S artIRED also
tested complexes of ruthenium, rhodium and iridium, again
concluding an IrCp* performs best in this scaffold also.
38
Tuning the electronic properties of the catalyst via the
ligands was also investigated in early works optimising the
streptavidin, CAII and periplasmic binding protein scaﬀolds.
The streptavidin design was altered with the organometallic
catalyst linked to biotin via the arene ligand to allow greater
freedom to change the bidentate ligand of the iridium catalyst.
Ligands containing an amino amide core delivered the highest
enantioselectivity for the reduction of 2a when incorporated
into wild-type Sav with up to 67% e.e. for ( S)-2b.
36 Monnard
et al.42 likewise prepared a range of bidentate ligands for
optimising the design of the CAII artIRED, achieving 70% e.e.
for ( S)-1b for WT CAII. In devising the PBP artIRED, it was
found a [Cp*Ir(pyridinesulfonamide)Cl] complex significantly
outperformed the more commonly used aminoethylsulfona-
mide ligand for the reduction of 1a hence was the catalyst of
choice in this design.
43
Furthermore, the length and attachment of the linker
between the catalyst and the anchoring unit can greatly aﬀect
the performance of the catalyst. In one approach, a family of
complexes with related structures, but variable linker lengths
were incorporated into CAII.
17 Linkers that were shorter than
optimal had a very high dissociation constant, indicating that
the biotinylated cofactor readily dissociated from the protein.
Cofactors containing linkers one and two atoms longer than
this gave much smaller dissociation constants, in line with
quantitative binding of the cofactor to CAII, but markedly
diﬀerent catalytic activity, exhibiting the importance of the
secondary coordination sphere to which the metal is exposed.
Optimising the protein scaﬀold
Site-directed and site-saturation mutagenesis. One of
the most widely used approaches to optimising the protein is
rational design, where residues in close proximity to the metal,
identified from crystal structures of ArMs, are exchanged
for other amino acids or peptide motifs in an attempt to alter
the secondary coordination sphere.
46,47 The most common
changes are exchanging non-coordinating amino acids for
coordinating residues or the addition or removal of bulky
residues in the binding pocket. The nature of the amino acids
in the active site aﬀects the stereochemistry at the metal
complex and the position in which the substrate can interact
with the metal complex; hence, their alteration provides oppor-
tunities for the optimisation and customisation of ArMs.
An interesting example attempted to confine the metal
cofactor inside streptavidin by adding sterically bulky structure
around the biotin-binding vestibule.
48 Analysis of crystal struc-
tures of Sav artIREDs revealed that the metal ion is not precisely
localised in the Sav protein, indicated a by less than full occupancy.
Fig. 5 (a) Schematic of the ArM based on a periplasmic protein scaﬀold.
The design comprises of an azotochelin anchoring unit, which forms a
complex with Fe III, with this complex being bound by the periplasmic
binding protein. The synthetic catalyst is attached via a bidentate ligand,
containing an aryl sulfonamide group, to the azotochelin anchoring unit.

It was thought that confining the metal more precisely would
improve catalytic activity. Multiple residues around the active
site were individually exchanged for short protein loops.
Mutants with no change in protein stability or tendency
to aggregate were identified and these positions were selected
for the insertion of well-defined, naturally occurring protein
motifs, as a method of introducing steric bulk. The resulting
chimeric scaﬀolds did not aﬀect biotin-binding capability but
nor did they significantly help in localising the metal cofactor,
although, in some cases, improved turnover numbers (TONs)
were observed.
Site-saturation mutagenesis goes a step further, where
selected residues are exchanged with a complete or slightly
reduced library of amino acids and the resulting variants
screened for improved catalytic activity. This method has an
advantage in that it does not require the exact eﬀects of
exchanging one amino acid for another to be predicted, screen-
ing a library of variants often produces more successful results.
For streptavidin, this initially identified two variants, S112A
which produced ( R)-1b (96% e.e.) and S112K, which produced
(S)-1b (78% e.e.).
15 The fact that selectivity for either enantio-
mer can be accessed through modifying the same protein
structure emphasises the importance of the directing eﬀect of
the secondary coordination sphere.
Computational design. The trial-and-error approach to opti-
mising the protein component of the ArM is time-consuming
and costly.
49 Computational modelling was used to map the
mechanistic behaviour of a Sav artIRED to gain a better under-
standing of how diﬀerent residues in the secondary coordina-
tion shell aﬀects the enantioselectivity.
50 Computations for two
(R)- and ( S)-selective Sav variants revealed that the energy
diﬀerence between the transition states for the two products
agreed well with the observed enantioselectivity. It is hoped
that by aiding our understanding of reaction mechanisms,
computational modelling can help identify changes to optimise
the protein structure directly through rational design, reducing
the number of mutants to be tested.
The Rosetta design algorithm was employed by the Baker
and Ward groups
29 in an attempt to optimise the CAII artIRED
and demonstrate the progress of computational methods on
enzyme redesign. It was theorized that improving the stability
and localization of the organometallic cofactor would lead to
improved occupancy and performance. The algorithm identi-
fied four CAII variants with small numbers of mutations that
either increased the hydrophobicity of the binding pocket,
improved the packing interactions between the protein and
the cofactor, or increased the rigidity of the protein backbone.
These mutations led to a 46- to 64-fold improvement in the
aﬃnity of the cofactor for the protein scaﬀold and to significant
improvements in enantioselectivity and activity. Modifications
to the cofactor to increase the hydrophobicity of the Cp* ligand
gave further improvement in enantioselectivity. This resulted
in the most ( S)-selective artIRED for 1b reported up to 2015,
with one of the variants performing with 96% e.e. and a 6-fold
increase in turnover number compared to the wild-type
artIRED.
33
Engineering to improve fine-tuning. A larger scale engineer-
ing approach on the streptavidin design was recently reported
to improve the fine-tuning of the secondary coordination
sphere.51 Streptavidin assembles as a tetramer, constructed
from a dimer of dimers, where the biotin-binding pockets are
located at the interface between two protein chains (Fig. 6a).
Any mutation of residues in this pocket is, therefore, displayed
twice, reducing the amount of fine control in engineering the
protein structure. By fusing the C-terminus of one subunit to
the N-terminus of a second via a 26 amino acid linker, a single-
chain dimer (scd) was formed where mutations can now be
selectively made in one subunit without being reflected in the
other. Additionally, H127, at the interface between the resulting
pair of dimers, was mutated to a cysteine to form a disulfide
bridge, further stabilising the structure (Fig. 6b). The resulting
finely tuned mutants performed well, with many displaying
significant rate enhancement of the Cp*Ir cofactor, as well as
good enantioselectivity. The best performing variants on sub-
strates 1–5a achieved the following significant results: ( R)-1b
with 100% conversion and 96% e.e., ( R)-3b with 99% conver-
sion and 93% e.e., and ( R)-4b with 90% conversion and 98% e.e.
with catalyst loadings of 0.25 mol%. Substrates 2a and 5a
proved more challenging, with all variants displaying only
moderate enantioselectivity for 2b and poor conversion to
5b.
51 Additionally the biotin-binding capacity of one unit in
the single-chain dimer could be removed to reduce the varia-
bility of catalytic performance depending on the cofactor : Sav
ratio. Most monovalent scdSav artIREDs were found to outper-
form their equivalent divalent scd artIREDs, among them, the
best variants for producing ( R)-3b (91% e.e., 100% conversion,
0.05 mol% catalyst loading), ( R)-4b (96% e.e., 99% conversion,
0.05 mol% catalyst loading) and ( S)-5b (91% e.e., 98% conver-
sion, 0.5 mol% catalyst loading).
51
Directed evolution. Although other design strategies had
initially had some success, it has proved challenging to
predict the subtle eﬀects of protein structure and bonding on
enantioselectivity.
23,52 To date, our lack of understanding of
how the fine details of protein structure relate to activity has

via a disulfide bridge (yellow line) by mutating H127 for cysteine.

resulted in limited progress in the development of biocatalysts
by rational design. 22 Instead, researchers have looked to the
combinatorial approaches used in the optimisation of natural
enzymes, in particular, directed evolution, which has provided
a massive breakthrough in the engineering of enzymes for
increased stability, activity, selectivity and reaction scope.
52
Directed evolution is the use of repeated cycles of random muta-
genesis and/or DNA recombination to bring about diversity in the
protein scaﬀold. High-throughput screening methods are essential
to identify those protein variants with improved characteristics.
It was previously recognised that screening mutants was far
too time-consuming to consider using directed evolution
because of the need to purify proteins before addition of the
biotin-catalyst cofactor. If catalyst testing could be carried out
in cell extracts and cell lysates, it would speed up development
of artIREDs. However, screening in cellular contents poses
problems as heavy metal catalysts are often deactivated by
cellular components such as thiols, in particular glutathione.
Pre-treatment of cell extracts and lysates with an oxidising
agent could be one way of overcoming this limitation since
oxidised glutathione does not significantly aﬀect heavy metal
catalysts. A diamine, DiAm (Fig. 7), proved most eﬀective,
allowing for measurable activity of artIREDs in both cell-free
extracts and cell lysate,
53 which significantly reduces the time
needed to prepare multiple variants for screening.
In a pioneering study, 54 directed evolution was carried out
on a small library of amino acids located around the iridium
catalyst. It was concluded that bulky residues can limit the
degrees of freedom of the bound cofactor, increase the inter-
actions between the protein and the metal ion and influence
the enantioselectivity observed. Two mutants, one selective for
(R)-2b (95% e.e.) and one for ( S)-2b (86% e.e.), were identified,
with both displaying increased reaction rates and enantioselec-
tivity compared to the previously best performing Sav artIREDs.
The study also explored the tolerance of mutants to biphasic
conditions, with some mutants showing improved enantio-
selectivity, although for others reduced activity was seen.
Immobilisation and encapsulation. Strategies to improve
the stability and performance of Sav artIREDs by use of
immobilisation or other tertiary environments have been inves-
tigated. Immobilisation of Sav artIRED variants on silica nano-
particles covered with an organosilica film was found to protect
the catalysts from deactivation, even in the presence of cellular
debris and the organic solvent methanol. The nanoparticles
could be recycled up to three times with only a minor loss of
selectivity.
12
Another study encapsulated S112A, S112K and S112A-K121A
Sav artIRED variants inside ferritin, an iron storage protein,
which provides a tertiary coordination shell for the solvent
exposed catalyst. Encapsulation of the artIRED was achieved
by exposing ferritin to low pH, at which the protein would
unfold, before raising the pH together with the addition of the
artIRED, allowing ferritin to refold around the artIRED. This
had a remarkable eﬀect on enantioselectivity, with ( S)-1b
produced irrespective of the Sav mutant used, proving that this
tertiary coordination sphere strongly influences the catalytic
mechanism. This inversion of enantioselectivity was not seen,
however, for 2b, with the observed selectivity in line with that
expected for the un-encapsulated artIRED. Overall, the encap-
sulated artIREDs performed relatively poorly with regards to
conversion and enantioselectivity but some mutants did display
an increased TON.

Future directions
Biocatalysis
In vivo. In vivo catalysis oﬀers an attractive alternative to
isolated ArMs since it removes the need for protein extraction
and purification steps making them easier to apply to large-
scale catalysis. If the engineered ArM is proven to be stable
inside the cell, it brings additional benefits of increased
protection from external factors and easy removal following
catalysis. In vivocatalysis has been achieved with Sav artIREDs
by engineering Sav to be expressed in the periplasm of E. coli.
56
The periplasm was targeted due to the significantly lower
concentration of glutathione compared to the cytoplasm.
Glutathione deactivates many organometallic catalysts, even
once incorporated into an ArM, hence it was hoped that by
expressing Sav in the periplasm, the artIRED could assemble
and perform imine reduction successfully. A 24-residue motif
with a well-defined tertiary structure was engineered to be
incorporated near to the surface of the biotin-binding site in
a further attempt to minimise deactivation of the catalyst by
external factors. Substrate 6a was used to test localisation and
activity of artIREDs since reduction of the imine bond triggers
decomposition to 6b and the fluorescent dye umbelliferone, 6c
(Fig. 8), allowing the reaction to be followed by fluorescence
spectroscopy. Results proved the successful localisation of Sav
in the periplasm and the formation of a functional artIRED by
addition of biotinylated cofactor.
Enzyme cascades. Enzyme cascades represent an exciting
application of these ArMs, being an attractive method of
achieving complex multistep syntheses without the use of
protecting groups or the isolation and purification of inter-
mediates. There have been several successful reports of Sav
artIREDs being incorporated into cascades with natural enzymes.
Cascades examined to date can be split into two categories, the
first being the introduction of artIREDs into cascades where
additional enzymes are used to enhance the enantiomeric purity
of an amine product from the reduction of an imine substrate by
the artIRED (Fig. 9a). These cascades typically consist of a
selective artIRED which favours production of one enantiomer
of the amine, and a second enzyme, for example a MAO
(monoamine oxidase), LAAO (
L-selective amino acid oxidase)
Fig. 7 Structure of the diamine DiAm.

or DAAO ( D-selective amino acid oxidase), which selectively
oxidises the unwanted enantiomer back into the imine starting
material leading to accumulation of the desired enantiomer
over time.
57
ArtIREDs have also been engineered to use the bioavailable
hydride donor cofactors NADPH or NADH in place of formate.
W h i l es u c ha r t I R E D sh a v eb e e nc o m b i n e di nt h ef i r s tc a t e g o r y ,58
they have had wider use in the secondary category of cascades,
where the product of interest is formed by a downstream
natural enzyme (Fig. 9b). Downst ream enzymes incorporated so
far have performed hydroxylations
57 and asymmetric reduction of
a,b-unsaturated compounds14 along with examples of multistep
cascades. In one such example, an alcohol dehydrogenase was
used to regenerate NADPH. A two-step cascade was designed to be
carried out by the alcohol dehydrogenase and the artIRED. In the
first step, a linear amino alcohol was converted to cyclic imine 4a
by the alcohol dehydrogenase w ith simultaneous reduction of
NADP+. The artIRED then used the resulting NADPH to reduce the
imine 4a to its corresponding amine, 4b (Fig. 9c).58
Challenges. There are, however, significant limitations to be
solved before artIREDs can be seriously exploited for biocata-
lysis. So far, few attempts have been made to carry out catalysis
on an industrially-relevant scale.
51 Even then, the access to a
limited number of amine products, plus competition from
IREDs, may give few biocatalysis options. Attempts to improve
stability, tolerance to organic solvents or cheaper costs should
lead to improved commercial prospects, however, the engineer-
ing techniques that can be used to improve these character-
istics are equally applicable to natural enzymes hence artIREDs
oﬀer no increased advantage.
Biomedical applications
It has been proposed that artIREDs could have significant
biomedical applications. Carbonic anhydrases are overex-
pressed on the surface of multiple types of cancer cells. It is
hoped that by converting these surface exposed proteins into
ArMs, anti-cancer ‘‘prodrugs’’ could be activated in the immedi-
ate proximity of cancer cells in the future. In this system,
genetic optimisation of the protein was not accessible since it
relied on the expression of CAII as it would appear on the
surface of host cells, hence a study was carried out to determine
the best design of arylsulfonamide-catalyst cofactor. Strains of
E. coli were engineered to express CAII in localised compart-
ments of the cell; the cytoplasm, periplasm and the cell surface.

cence spectroscopy.

The selected cofactors were then introduced and the activity of
the artIREDs tested on an imine substrate 6a, which releases
the fluorescent dye umbelliferone 6c on reduction. The results
identified an improved cofactor for incorporation into wild-type
CAII for in vivowhole-cell catalysis.
17 It will prove exceptionally
interesting if the work reported in E. coliwith CAII artIREDs can
be replicated in eukaryotic cells.
Engineering artIREDs to accept nicotinamide cofactors
as hydride sources in place of formate potentially opens up
further biomedical applications as iridium piano-stool com-
plexes of the type commonly incorporated into the artIRED
designs included in this review have been shown to have anti-
cancer properties.
59 Whether artIREDs could have the same
eﬀect remains to be seen.
Conclusions
Over a range of diﬀerent artIRED designs and optimisation
strategies, significant progress in catalytic performance and
enantioselectivities has been achieved. The development of
new screening techniques has proven important in allowing
faster development and use of methods, such as directed
evolution.
53,54,56 Progress in the use of computational model-
ling to better understand the interactions between the synthetic
catalyst and the protein looks to have potential to help with the
design of better performing ArMs. 49,60 Immobilisation of artIR-
EDs has provided additional ways to improve stability and
recovery strategies.
12,55
In summary, artIREDs have exciting potential biomedical
applications in addition to biocatalysis opportunities, in parti-
cular their use in enzyme cascades and in whole cell in vivo
catalysis. Successes in altering and improving the activity of
artIREDs will play a crucial role in designing and developing
ArMs, not only for imine reduction, but also other synthetically
challenging reactions. The knowledge gained from optimising
ArM designs for imine reduction will help to establish new strategies
and methods for producing eﬃcient, highly enantioselective ArMs.
