Mulholland,[c] GideonG rogan,[b] and Nicholas J. Turner*[a]\nAlthough the range of biocatalysts available for the synthesis\nof enantiomerically pure chiral amines continues to expand,\nfew existingm ethods provide access to secondary amines. To\naddress this shortcoming, we have over-expressed the gene\nfor an (R)-imine reductase [(R)-IRED] from Streptomyces sp.\nGF3587 in Escherichia coli to create ar ecombinantw hole-cell\nbiocatalyst for the asymmetricr eduction of prochiral imines.\nThe (R)-IRED was screened against ap anel of cyclic imines and\ntwo iminium ions and was shown to possess high catalytic ac-\ntivity and enantioselectivity.P reparative-scale synthesis of the\nalkaloid( R)-coniine (90 %y ield;9 9% ee)f rom the imine precur-\nsor was performed on ag ram-scale. Ah omology model of the\nenzymea ctive site, based on the structure of ac losely related\n(R)-IRED from Streptomyces kanamyceticus,w as constructed\nand used to identify potentiala mino acids as targets for muta-\ngenesis.\nChiral amines are key structural motifs widely found in many\nnaturalp roducts as well as pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals,\nand fine chemicals.[1] Methods for their preparationi no ptically\npure form include organo- and transition-metal-catalyzed\nasymmetrics ynthesis,[2] although approaches based on classi-\ncal resolution throughc rystallization or kinetic resolution[3]\noften remaint he method of choice in industry despite the\nmaximum theoretical yield capped at 50 %.[4] An alternative\nand attractive strategy for chiral amine synthesis is to employ\nenzymes, in particular biocatalysts the properties of which\nhave been tailored and enhanced by protein engineering and\ndirectede volution.[5] Notable developments in this area include\nthe use of monoamine oxidases (MAO-N),[6] phenylalanine\nammonia lyases,[7] and aminotransferases (transaminases,\nScheme1 ).[8]\nAdditionally,a n l-amino-acid dehydrogenase has recently\nbeen subjected to protein engineering and shown to catalyze\nthe asymmetric reductivea mination of ketones (amine dehy-\ndrogenases, Scheme 1).[9] In an umber of cases, these biocata-\nlysts have been implemented in large-scale manufacturing pro-\ncesses for the production of activep harmaceutical ingredients\nas well as their key intermediates.[10]\nWith the exception of MAO-N, whichc an be used for the\nchemoenzymatic deracemization of amines with broad struc-\ntural features,t he majority of theseb iocatalysts generate only\nprimary amines,w ith no direct access to secondary or tertiary\namines.I nc ontrast,t he asymmetric reduction of imines pro-\nvides an alternative methodf or generatingt hese motifs. Such\nan approach has been explored by the development of che-\nmocatalytic processes[11] and also the creationo fa rtificial met-\nalloenzymes,[12] which have been successfully used in tandem\nwith biocatalystsi nc ascade reactions.[13] However,t he enzy-\nmatic equivalent of this process remains largely unexplored.[14]\nRecently,a ni mine reductase [(S)-IRED] from Streptomyces sp.\nGF3546 expressed in Escherichia coli[15] was shown to catalyze\nthe enantioselective reduction of ar ange of different imines,\nincluding 2-substitutedc yclic imines, dihydroisoquinolines,\nb-carbolines, and also iminium ions.[16] This (S)-IRED was found\nto be exclusively dependento nt he cofactor NADPHa s\nas ource of hydride.T he identification of enantiocomplementa-\nry enzymes that provide access to both enantiomers of target\nproducts remains ak ey challenge in biocatalysis, which has\nbeen addressed recently by the development of (R)-selective\ntransaminases[17] and an (R)-selective amine oxidase.[18] Herein\nScheme1 .

Additionally,t he imine reductased isplayed significantly\nhigher catalytic activity than previously reported IREDs,w ith\nap reference for reducing 6-membered ring piperideine sub-\nstrates,w hich may provide insight into its natural substrate.\nTo explore the substrate scope of the (R)-IRED, ap anel of\ncyclic imines was synthesized ands creenedf or activity.W ith\nthe exception of 1a ,a ll 2-substituted iminesw ere prepared by\nap reviously reportedm ethod[20] involving the addition of an\norganometallic Grignard reagent to an N-Boc-protected lactam\n(Boc =tert-butoxycarbonyl), followed by deprotection of the\namine, which undergoes spontaneous cyclization to give the\nfree-base cyclic imine. This flexible approach allowed access to\ncyclic imines of varying ring sizes with ar ange of substituents.\nThe imines were isolated as their hydrochloride salts to en-\nhance their stabilitya sw ell as water solubility.\nSince the only previously reported substrate for the (R)-IRED\nwas 1a ,w hich gave excellent conversion( >98 %) and\nee (>98 %), our initial focus was directed towards screening\nar ange of 2-substituted pyrrolines.B iotransformations using\nresting E. coli cells expressing the (R)-IRED were conducted at\nsubstrate concentrations of 5m m with added glucose to aid\ncofactor recycling (see Supporting Information for the condi-\ntions used for cultivation of the recombinants train and expres-\nsion of the (R)-IRED). Negativec ontrolsu sing cells harboring\nthe empty plasmid vector were run in parallel to ensure that\nany observed activity occurred as ar esult of the IRED biocata-\nlysts.\nThe (R)-IRED was shown to catalyzet he reduction of pyrro-\nlines containing both aliphatic and aromatic substituents at\nC-2 (Table 1). In addition to the reduction of 1a to (R)-2a [from\nwhich the designation as (R)-IRED was derived] the phenyl-\nand cyclohexyl-substituted pyrrolines 1b and 1e ,r espectively,\nwere fully converted after 24 h; however,as ignificant reduc-\ntion in enantioselectivity was observed with these bulkiers ub-\nstituents. When a para-methoxy substituent was introduced on\nthe benzene ring, conversion fell to 20 %b ut the reaction pro-\nceeded with excellent selectivity to give (S)-2c in >98 % ee.\nUnder the same conditions, the (R)-IRED gave significantly\nhigher conversions than the previously reported (S)-IRED for\npyrroline substrates 1a –d.\nTo further investigate the substrate scope of the (R)-IRED,\nwhole-cellb iotransformations werep erformed with larger 6-\nand 7-membered-ring cyclic imine scaffolds. Tetrahydroaze-\npines 3a and 3c wereb oth convertedw ith excellents electivi-\nty.T he (R)-IRED was found to display particularly high activity\ntowards6 -membered rings,y ielding 2-substitutedp iperidines,\nwhich are important scaffolds in many biologically significant\ncompounds.[21] The high activity towards this class of com-\npoundi sa pparent if comparing the conversionso f para-\nmethoxyphenyl-substituted homologues 1c , 3c ,a nd 5c (con-\nversions =20, 50, and /C2198 %, respectively).

For\nsubstrates bearing phenyld erivatives, the introduction of\nas ubstituent on the ring led to an increase in enantioselectivi-\nty.B oth electron-donating and electron-withdrawing groups\nwere readily accepted, with high conversion and ee observed.\nInterestingly,a moderate decrease in selectivity was observed\nif moving the positiono ft he methoxy-substituentf rom para\nto meta and ortho,s ignaling an increasing contribution of\nac ompeting binding mode in which the opposite face of the\nimine is exposed for reduction by the NADPH.T he (R)-IRED\nreadily accepted other heterocyclic motifs including at hio-\nphene ring (5l ).\nWith simple alkyl and alkenyl substituents,t he (R)-IRED\nshowede xcellent enantioselectivity.I na ddition, reduction of\na,b-unsaturated imine 5j proceeded exclusively at the carbon–\nnitrogen double bond with no reduction of the alkene ob-\nserved. Reductiono f n-propyl-substituted piperideine 5i result-\ned in the formation of the more active (R)-enantiomer of the\nnatural product coniine in >98 % ee.T od emonstrate the appli-\ncation of the (R)-IRED biocatalyst for preparative-scale synthesis\nof chiral amines, the reduction of 5j was performed on a1 .0 g\n(25 mm)s cale, yielding (R)-coniine 6i (90 %y ield, >98 % ee),\nwhich was isolated as its hydrochlorides alt. In addition to\nsimple 2-substituted piperideines, 3,4-dihydroisoquinolines 7\nand 7a were also confirmed to be substrates for the enzyme.\nSignificantly,t he corresponding N-methyl iminium derivatives\n9 and 9a were also reduced, with chiral amine 10 a produced\nwith comparable selectivity (74 % ee), albeit with reduced con-\nversion, demonstrating the potential application of this biocat-\nalyst for the synthesis of tertiaryc hiral amines.\nBiotransformations of severals ubstrates conducted with the\nisolated enzyme,c oupled with an NADPH cofactor recycling\nsystem using glucose dehydrogenase 2f rom Bacillus megateri-\num,[22] showed no significant change in enantioselectivity if\ncompared to their whole-cell equivalents, with the exception\nof dihydroisoquinoline 7a for which unusually the selectivity\nappeared to diminisht og ive (R)-8a in 47 % ee (see Supporting\nInformation). As the whole-cell biocatalyst requires only the ad-\ndition of glucosef or cofactor recycling and negates the neces-\nsity of using large amounts of NADPH or an additional cofactor\nrecycling system, this approachw as used for any preparative\nbiotransformations.\nKineticp arameters were determined for representative sub-\nstrates (Table 3). Kinetic constants with the previously reported\n(S)-IRED from Streptomyces sp. GF3546 have been described\nwith substrates 1a , 3a , 5a , 7, 7a ,a nd 9 (i.e., kcat =0.024 s/C01,\n0.039 s/C01,0 .137 s/C01,0 .445 s/C01,0 .040 s/C01,a nd 0.483 s/C01,r espec-\ntively).[16] Excluding 7,s ignificantly higher kcat values andl ower\nMichaelis constants (Km)w ere observed for the (R)-IRED de-\nscribed herein (Table 3). The previously reporteds ubstrate 2-\nmethyl-1-pyrroline 1a had an otably lower kcat/Km value (cata-\nlytic efficiency) than severalp iperideine substrates tested. In\nparticular, we observed ag reater than sixty-fold increase in\nkcat/Km for 2-methyl-1-piperideine 5a over pyrroline 1a .T his\npreference for 6- and 7-membered ring systems is shared with\nthe (S)-IRED and may allude to the natural function of this\nclass of enzyme. The (R)-IRED also displayed greater activity to-\nwards simple alkyl- and alkenyl-substituted imines compared\nwith those bearing aromatic moieties.\nAs election of ketones and oximes were screened for activity\nwith the (R)-IRED, with no conversion detected (see Supporting\nInformation). The absence of activity towards ketones suggests\nfuture potential applications of this enzymef or intermolecular\nreductivea minations, which remains as ignificant challenge in\norganic synthesis.\nWe have recently determined the structure of oxidoreduc-\ntase Q1EQE0 from Streptomyces kanamyceticus,[22] which shares\n50 %s equence identityw ith the (R)-IRED,a nd which also cata-\nlyzes the (R)-selective reduction of imine substrates such as 2-\nmethyl-1-pyrroline 1a .T he structureo fQ 1EQE0 revealed ad i-\nmeric associationi nw hicht wo monomers associate very close-\nly through domain swapping. The active site, containing\nNADPH, is ac hannelt hat traverses the width of the dimer.T he\nactive site also revealed residues which mayb er esponsible for\ncatalysis, including Asp187, which was proposed to be the cat-\nalytic residue for protonation of the imine in IRED-mediated\ncatalysis.[22] The similarity between the two sequences gave us\nconfidence to build am odel of the (R)-IRED (Figure 1a )u sing\nthe Phyre2 server.[23] In the model,A sp187 in Q1EQE0i sc on-\nservedi nt he (R)-IRED as Asp172 and many of the other resi-\ndues within the region of the active site also appear to be con-\nservedb etween the two enzymes (Figure 1b ).\nThe role of Asp172 in the catalytic mechanism was further\nprobedb yg eneration of the Asp172Ala and Asp172Lysp oint\nmutantsb ys ite-directedm utagenesis.

These compounds contain either\na piperideine ring, or a piperidine ring which may be fused to a ﬁve membered ring, and\na polyene side chain, which is bound in some cases to an N-acetylcysteine moiety. The\narp cluster consists of 11 genes coding for structural proteins, two for regulatory proteins\nand one for a hypothetical protein. Herein, we have characterized the post-piperideine\nring biosynthesis steps of argimycins P through the generation of mutants inarp genes,\nthe identiﬁcation and characterization of compounds accumulated by those mutants,\nand cross-feeding experiments between mutants. Based in these results, a biosynthesis\npathway is proposed assigning roles to every arp gene product. The regulation of the\narp cluster is also addressed by inactivating/overexpressing the positive SARP-likearpRI\nand the negative TetR-likearpRII transcriptional regulators and determining the effect on\nargimycins P production, and through gene expression analyses (reverse transcription\nPCR and quantitative real-time PCR) of arp genes in regulatory mutants in comparison\nto the wild type strain. These ﬁndings will contribute to deepen the knowledge on the\nbiosynthesis of piperidine-containing polyketides and provide tools that can be used to\ngenerate new analogs by genetic engineering and/or biocatalysis.\nKeywords: type I polyketide synthase, pyridine, piperidine, piperideine, imine reductase, specialized metabolites,\nregulation, alkaloid\nINTRODUCTION\nAlkaloids are a group of natural products synthesized by plants, animals, and microorganisms that\nshow a broad structural diversity and the presence of a basic nitrogen atom as a common feature\n(Cushnie et al., 2014; Sigrist et al., 2015). This family of compounds shows signiﬁcant bioactivity,\nin some cases beneﬁcial (antimalarial, antitumor, antiasthma, antihypertensive, anti-arrhythmic,\nanalgesic), but in others harmful for humans and animals (Cushnie et al., 2014; Sigrist et al., 2015).\nIn addition, they seem to play diﬀerent roles in producer organisms. In microorganisms, alkaloids\nhave been involved in growth and colony development, self-defense or as autoinducers (Heeb et al.,\n2011; Cushnie et al., 2014; Ye et al., 2017). Attending to the chemical structure there are two classes\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 1 February 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 252\nfmicb-09-00252 February 15, 2018 Time: 16:25 # 2\nYe et al. Biosynthesis of Argimycins P\nof alkaloids: heterocyclic or typical alkaloids and\nnon-heterocyclic/atypical/protoalkaloids bearing nitrogen\natoms in a side chain (Cushnie et al., 2014). Some of the most\nimportant alkaloids contain a piperidine ring, and in the so\ncalled true alkaloids these rings derive from amino acids.\nHowever, some piperidine-containing alkaloids or piperidine\npseudoalkaloids from polyketide origin acquire their nitrogen\natoms via transamination reactions (Sigrist et al., 2015).\nActinomycetes are a group of bacteria that have attracted the\nattention of academic and industrial researchers, because they\nproduce a plethora of natural products displaying antibiotic,\nantitumor, immunosuppressant or anthelmintic activities (Bérdy,\n2012; Newman and Cragg, 2016). Most of these compounds are\npeptides (ribosomal and non-ribosomal synthesized), polyketides\nor terpenes. Particularly, several piperidine-containing alkaloids\nof polyketide origin have been isolated from actinomycetes,\nsuch as coelimycin P (Gómez-Escribano et al., 2012), cyclizidine\n(Freer et al., 1982), iromycins (Surup et al., 2007), latumcidin\n(also known as abikoviromycin; Seto et al., 1973), piericidins\n(Zhou and Fenical, 2016), strepchazolins (Y ang et al., 2017),\nstreptazolins (Mayer and Thiericke, 1993; Puder et al., 2001),\nstreptazones AñD (Puder et al., 2000), streptazone E (Liu et al.,\n2013), or streptopyridines (Groenhagen et al., 2014). These\ncompounds show a range of activities such as antimicrobial,\nantiviral, cytotoxic, decreasing blood pressure and cholesterol\nbiosynthesis, or analgesic (Umezawa et al., 1951; Terashima\net al., 1970; Grabley et al., 1991; Puder et al., 2001). However,\ninformation about their biosynthesis pathways is quite scarce.\nThus, only the biosynthesis gene clusters for coelimycin P ,\ncyclizidine and streptazone E have been identiﬁed so far (Gómez-\nEscribano et al., 2012; Huang et al., 2015; Ohno et al., 2015).\nBiosynthesis of these compounds involves a Type I or modular\npolyketide synthase (PKS). These are macroenzyme complexes\ntypically organized into modules, which are responsible for\na single elongation cycle and contains a β-ketoacyl synthase\n(KS), an acyltransferase (AT) and an acyl carrier protein\n(ACP) domain. In addition, these modules can contain optional\ndomains such as ketoreductase (KR), dehydratase (DH) or enoyl\nreductase (ER) that modify the β-keto group after an elongation\nevent (Weissman, 2015).\nArgimycins P ( Figure 1A ) comprise a group of polyketide\nalkaloid compounds produced by Streptomyces argillaceusATCC\n12956 that show either a piperideine ring, or a piperidine ring\nfused or not with a ﬁve-membered ring, and a polyene side chain.\nIn addition, some argimycins P contain an N-acetylcysteine\nmoiety. Very recently, we have reported the isolation and\nchemical characterization of these compounds that seem to\nplay some role in both growth and colony development in the\nproducer strain (Ye et al., 2017). In addition, we also reported\nthe identiﬁcation of the argimycins P biosynthesis gene cluster\narp and showed that biosynthesis of nigrifactin, a putative\nintermediate containing a piperideine ring, requires the ArpP\nPKS and the ArpN aminotransferase (Ye et al., 2017). Herein we\ndescribe new insights into the argimycin P biosynthesis pathway\nthrough the inactivation of arp genes putatively involved in post-\npiperideine ring formation biosynthesis steps, the identiﬁcation\nand characterization of the compounds produced by each\nmutant, and cross-feeding experiments between mutants. In\naddition, we also address the regulation of argimycins P\nbiosynthesis by studying the expression pattern of the arp genes\nin mutants in speciﬁc regulatory genes in comparison with the\nwild type strain.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nStrains, Culture Conditions, Plasmids\nand DNA Manipulations\nStreptomyces argillaceus ATCC 12956 was used as source of\nDNA to generate mutants and for argimycins P production\nexperiments. The argimycin P-non producers S. argillaceus\nMARPPIII (PKS-minus mutant), S. argillaceus MARPN\n(aminotransferase-minus mutant), S. argillaceus DARPO-HII\n(mutant with a deletion from arpO to arpHII), S. argillaceus\nMARPRI (positive regulatory arpRI-minus mutant) and\nS. argillaceus MARPRII (negative regulatory arpRII-minus\nmutant) ( Table 1) (Ye et al., 2017) were used in co-synthesis\nand/or bioconversion experiments, and to quantify argimycins\nP production. Escherichia coli DH10B (Invitrogen) and\nE. coli ET12567/pUB307 (Kieser et al., 2000) were used as\ncloning hosts for plasmid propagation and for conjugation\nexperiments, respectively. MA and SM10 media (Fernández\net al., 1998; Ye et al., 2017) were used for sporulation and\nargimycins P production by S. argillaceus, respectively. When\nrequired, antibiotics were added to media at the following\nﬁnal concentrations: ampicillin (100 µg/mL), kanamycin\n(50 µg/mL), nalidixic acid (25 µg/mL), apramycin (25 µg/mL),\nand thiostrepton (50 µg/mL). Plasmids pCRBlunt (Invitrogen)\nand pUO9090 (M. C. Martín, unpublished results) were used\nfor subcloning. Plasmid pHZ1358 (Sun et al., 2002) was\nused for generating mutants by gene replacement. pIAGO\n(Aguirrezabalaga et al., 2000), pSETE (I. García, personal\ncommunication), pSETec and pSETeTc (Cano-Prieto et al.,\n2015) were used for complementing mutants and overexpressing\narp genes. DNA manipulations, intergeneric conjugations\nand transformations were carried out according to standard\nprocedures for Streptomyces (Kieser et al., 2000) and for\nE. coli (Sambrook and Russell, 2001). PCR ampliﬁcations were\ndone using Herculase (Stratagene) and 5% dimethyl sulfoxide\n(DMSO). Puriﬁed amplicons were sequenced and compared to\nothers in databases. Sequence analyses were carried out using\nBLAST (Altschul et al., 1997).\nGeneration of Mutants\nMutants in speciﬁc arp genes were generated by replacing\nmost of the corresponding genes by an apramycin resistance\ncassette that was inserted in the same direction of transcription\n(Table 1 ). Accordingly, several plasmids were constructed in\npHZ1358 by PCR amplifying DNA regions ﬂanked the target\ngene using oligonucleotides described in Supplementary Table\nS1, and by inserting an apramycin resistance cassette between\nthose fragments (see Supplementary Material). Ampliﬁed DNA\nfragments were checked by DNA sequencing.

After 24 h of growth,\nco-synthesis cultures were prepared by combining cultures from\ntwo individual cultures (1.5 ml from each) into a well. Samples\nwere harvested after 0, 24, and 48 h of incubation.\nFor bioconversion experiments with nigrifactin, cultures of\nthe diﬀerent mutant strains in SM10 medium were fed with\nnigrifactin (0.1 mM ﬁnal concentration). Samples were harvested\nafter 24 h of incubation.\nTranscription Analyses\nTotal RNA was obtained from S. argillaceus wild type and\nS. argillaceus mutants MARPRI and MARPRII as previously\ndescribed (Flórez et al., 2015). This RNA was used as template for\ngene expression analysis by reverse transcriptase-PCR (RT-PCR)\nand real time PCR (qPCR). Qualitative gene expression was\nstudied using the SuperScript\nR⃝IIITM One-Step RT-PCR system\nwith Platinum\nR⃝ Taq DNA polymerase (Invitrogen). cDNA\nsynthesis was performed using 50 ng or 100 ng of total RNA as\ntemplate at 50 ◦C for 30 min, followed by heating at 94 ◦C for\n2 min. Sample mixtures included 32.2 U of RNA-guard RNase\ninhibitor (Amersham Biosciences). Ampliﬁcation conditions\nwere as follows: 33 cycles of 98 ◦C for 15 s; 62 ◦C for 45 s;\n72◦C for 1 min; and a ﬁnal extension step at 72 ◦C for 10 min.\nOligonucleotides (Supplementary Table S3) were designed within\nevery arp gene to produce cDNAs of approximately 350ñ550 bp.\nPrimers for arpRI and arpRII were designed to amplify an\ninternal DNA region located upstream of the inserted apramycin\nresistance cassette. In the case of arpRII the cDNA product was\nof approximately 150 bp. The identity of these fragments was\nveriﬁed by direct sequencing. Negative controls for each pair of\nprimers were carried out with Platinum Taq DNA polymerase\n(Invitrogen) in the absence of reverse transcriptase. hrdB gene\nexpression levels were used to normalize RNA concentration of\nthe tested strains.

Biosynthesis of Argimycins P\ndesigned using the algorithms provided by Primer Express\nsoftware 2.0 (Applied Biosystems), and their eﬃciency was\ncalculated based on the slope of a standard curve. To determine\nampliﬁcation speciﬁcity an additional dissociation curve analysis\nwas performed after the last cycle, showing in all cases one single\npeak. PCR results were given as the increase in the ﬂuorescence\nsignal of the reporter dye detected and visualized by the MxPro\nSoftware provided with the version 4.1 (Agilent Technologies).\nChanges in gene expression are represented with respect to the\ncontrol sample (wild-type strain).\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nGeneration and Characterization of\nS. argillaceusMutants in arp Genes\nThe arp gene cluster contains 14 genes: 11 for structural proteins\n(arpDHI, arpDHII, arpHI, arpHII, arpK, arpN, arpO, arpPI,\narpPII, arpPIII, and arpT), two coding for regulatory proteins\n(arpRI and arpRII), and one for a hypothetical protein ( arpX).\nWe have previously shown that formation of the piperideine\nring of argimycins P is achieved by expressing the arpPI, arpPII,\nand arpPIII genes that encode a hexamodular PKS and the\narpN aminotransferase gene (Ye et al., 2017). In order to obtain\nfurther insights into argimycin P biosynthesis and to assign\nfunctions to other arp coding genes, a set of gene-knockout\nexperiments were carried out, followed by metabolic proﬁle\nanalyses. Mutants were obtained by replacing the wild type copy\nof the gene in the S. argillaceus chromosome by an in vitro\nmutated one. Several constructs in the unstable plasmid pHZ1358\nwere generated, in which most of the target arp gene was\nreplaced by an apramycin resistance cassette inserted in the\ndirection of transcription of the targeted gene. The resultant\nconstructs were introduced into S. argillaceus, and apramycin-\nresistant thiostrepton-sensitive transconjugants were selected.\nOne mutant for each inactivated gene was selected for further\ncharacterization. The occurrence of a double recombination\nevent in each mutant strain was genetically veriﬁed by PCR\nanalyses using proper oligoprimers (Supplementary Table S1).\nIn order to determine that no other gene except the target\ngene was aﬀected, in trans complementation of each mutant\nwas carried out using plasmids expressing the corresponding\ngene and by conﬁrming the recovery of argimycins P production\n(Table 1 and Supplementary Figure S1). The mutants were\nfurther characterized for production of argimycins P (or analogs)\nby Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) and\nHPLC-MS analyses, and the new compounds accumulated by the\nmutants puriﬁed and characterized.\nMutants inarpDHI and arpDHII Genes\nThe arp gene cluster contains two contiguous genes transcribed\nin the same direction ( arpDHI and arpDHII) that code for\ndehydrogenases: ArpDHI is similar to acyl-CoA dehydrogenases,\nand it has been hypothesized to be involved in the hydroxylation\nof the piperidine ring and/or in the reduction of the\nC7ñC8 double bond of the polyene chain during argimycins\nP biosynthesis (Ye et al., 2017). ArpDHII is similar to\n6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenases, and it has been proposed to\nbe an imine reductase catalyzing the reduction of the imine group\n(Ye et al., 2017). Using pHZMutorf6 and pHZMutorf7long, the\nwild type copy of arpDHI and arpDHII were replaced by an\napramycin resistance cassette, generating mutants MARPDHI\nand MARPDHII, respectively ( Table 1 and Supplementary\nFigures S2, S3). Analysis of cultures of mutant MARPDHI\n(Figure 2) revealed production of compounds containing a single\npiperideine or a piperidine ring (nigrifactin and argimycin PIX;\nFigure 1A) and the disappearance of argimycins P compounds\ncontaining the ﬁve-membered ring (Figure 1A). Further analysis\nof this mutant showed that it also produced argimycins PVII\nand PVIII (peak 3 ∗ in Figure 2 ; see below). These results\nindicated that ArpDHI is involved in an early biosynthesis step\nof argimycins P prior to the ﬁve-membered ring formation. Since\nargimycin PVIII and PIX are produced by mutant MARPDHI,\nthis ruled out ArpDHI from the reduction of the C7ñC8 double\nbond of the polyene side chain and in the reduction of the imine.\nCultures of MARPDHII contained traces of unidentiﬁed\nargimycin P-like compounds and a small amount of nigrifactin\n(Figure 2B ). This result reinforced the hypothesis of ArpDHII\nacting in an early biosynthesis step as an imine reductase,\nmost likely before ArpDHI. Based on this result, bioconversions\nexperiments were designed to conﬁrm this activity. Accordingly,\nnigrifactin which contains an imine group was fed to cultures of\nthe argimycin P non-producer S. argillaceus MARPPIII (PKS-\nminus mutant) to determine if nigrifactin could be converted\nto other argimycins P. After 24 h of incubation, a new peak\nwas detected (peak VII in Figure 3 ) that showed the same\nretention time, mass and absorption spectrum as argimycin\nPVII (Figure 1B; see below). This bioconversion indicated that\nthe imine group in nigrifactin is reduced to the amino group\nin argimycin PVII. Since none of the argimycins P bearing\nthe ﬁve-membered ring was detected, this result also suggested\nthat neither nigrifactin nor argimycin PVII were biosynthetic\nintermediates for the formation of the ﬁve-membered ring\ncompounds. To determine if the imine reductase coding gene\nwas an arp gene, nigrifactin was fed to S. argillaceus DARPO-\nHII (a mutant with a deletion from arpO to arpHII; Table 1).\nArgimycin PVII could not be detected ( Figure 3 ), indicating\nthat one of the arp deleted genes in this mutant was responsible\nfor reduction of the imine. Finally, to identify this arp gene,\nnigrifactin was fed to S. argillaceus DARPO-HII expressing\narpDHII (S. argillaceus DARPO-HII-pSETETorf7; Table 1). In\nthis case, argimycin PVII was detected ( Figure 3). These results\nconﬁrmed the function of ArpDHII as the imine reductase\ninvolved in argimycins P biosynthesis.\nMutants inarpHI and arpHII Genes\narpHI and arpHII are two small genes convergently transcribed\nthat code for proteins belonging to the NTF2_like superfamily,\nwhich have been proposed to be cyclases (Ye et al., 2017).

In addition, two new peaks, absent in the wild\ntype strain, were detected at 272 nm (peak 1; Figure 2B ) and\n230 nm (peaks 1 and 2; Figure 2C ), with retention times of\n3.04 and 3.13 min, respectively. Peak 2 contained a compound\ndisplaying a maximum at ca. 228 nm in the UV (DAD) spectrum\nthat was identical to the previously characterized argimycin\nPIX (Ye et al., 2017). After puriﬁcation of this compound\nits molecular formula was established as C 12H19NO based on\nthe pseudomolecular ion peak [M +H]+ observed at 194.1541\n(calcd. for C 12H20NO+ =194.1539). NMR analysis revealed\nthe presence of an epoxide, which accounted for the extra\noxygen and degree of unsaturation (Supplementary Figures S6,\nS7, S10, and Supplementary Table S4). This new compound was\nnamed argimycin PXI ( Figure 1B ). On the other hand, peak\n1 contained two compounds with diﬀerent masses (m/z values\nof 192 [M +H]+and 194 [M +H]+). Importantly, levels of the\nlower-mass compound greatly decreased when cultures were\nincubated in the dark, which enabled the puriﬁcation of the\nhigher-mass compound by cultivating MARPHII in darkness.\nNMR analysis conﬁrmed it as having a structure equal to\nargimycin PXI but with Z stereochemistry in the middle double\nbond of the side chain (Supplementary Figures S8ñS10 and Table\nS5).

Biosynthesis of Argimycins P\nhypothesized that this compound (named argimycin PVII) could\nbe an analog of nigrifactin bearing an amino rather than an\nimine group. To prove this, nigrifactin was subjected to chemical\nreduction with sodium borohydride (NaBH 4). Thus, after 1 h\nof reaction nigrifactin was completely consumed and a new\ncompound appeared with the same retention time and mass\n(178 [M +H]+) as argimycin PVII ( Figure 4 ). NMR analyses\n(Supplementary Figures S11, S12 and Supplementary Table S6)\nconﬁrmed the structure of argimycin PVII ( Figure 1B ). This\ncompound was previously reported by Ohno et al. (2015). To\nenable isolation of the other two compounds from peak 3,\nMARPHII was cultivated on darkness since the production\nof argimycin PVII greatly decreased under these conditions.\nAccordingly, a sample enriched in the two other compounds\nwas puriﬁed. The compound with the highest mass, the most\nabundant, showed a molecular formula of C 12H20ClNO based\non the pseudomolecular ion peak [M+H]+observed at 230.1307\n(calcd. for C 12H21ClNO+ = 230.1306). NMR elucidation\nrevealed a chlorohydrin structurally related to the epoxide found\nin argimycin PXI (Supplementary Figures S10, S13, S14 and\nSupplementary Table S8). This new compound was named\nargimycin PXII ( Figure 1B ). Regarding the minor compound,\nthe molecular formula was established as C 12H21N based on the\npseudomolecular ion peak [M+H]+observed at 180.1748 (calcd.\nfor C12H22N+=180.1747) that was identical to argimycin PIX\n(Ye et al., 2017), and NMR analyses (Supplementary Figures S13,\nS14 and Supplementary Table S7) conﬁrmed that this compound,\nwhich was named argimycin PVIII ( Figure 1B), is a geometric\nisomer of argimycin PIX. On the other hand, careful analysis\nof cultures from the wild type strain and from some other\narp mutants showed that argimycin PVII and PVIII but not\nargimycin PXII, were identiﬁed in the metabolite proﬁles of these\nstrains (peak 3 ∗, Figures 2B,C). All these results conﬁrmed that\nMARPHI and MARPHII are blocked before the cyclization event\nthat leads to the formation of the ﬁve-membered ring.\nMutant inarpO\narpO is divergently transcribed from arpDHI and arpDHII.\nIt shows high similarity to several putative oxidases including\namino oxidases, and contains domains present in dehydrogenases\nproteins. Using pHZMutorf5 most of the wild type copy of arpO\nwas replaced by an apramycin resistance cassette, generating\nmutant MARPO ( Table 1 and Supplementary Figure S15).\nAnalysis of the metabolite proﬁle produced by MARPO revealed\nthat it produced all argimycins P except argimycins PI and PII\n(Figure 2 ). These compounds diﬀer from other argimycins P\nwith two rings by containing a pyridine instead of a piperidine\nring and by the presence of an N-acetylcysteine residue attached\nto the polyene chain ( Figure 1A ). Moreover, two new peaks\nwere detected in cultures of MARPO at 276 nm ( Figure 2B ),\nwhich eluted at 2.75 and 3.15 min, respectively. The early\npeak contained a single compound that was too unstable to be\npuriﬁed. The late peak (peak 4 in Figure 2B) was puriﬁed and\nshowed a maximum at 288 nm in the UV/vis spectrum. The\nHRMS information rendered a molecular formula of C 12H17N\nbased on the observed ion [M +H]+ at 176.1433 (calcd. for\nC12H18N+ =176.1434). Such formula was identical to that\nFIGURE 4 | Chemical reduction of nigrifactin with sodium borohydride\n(NaBrH4).

Elucidation of the structure was assisted\nby comparing its NMR data (Supplementary Figures S16ñS18,\nand Supplementary Table S9) to those from argimycins PIV ,\nPV and PVI (Ye et al., 2017). The proposed structure for\nthis new compound, named argimycin PXIV ( Figure 1B ), was\nsimilar to that of argimycin PVI ( Figure 1A ) but diﬀering in\nthe position of the double bond, which was between C4ñC4a\nin the former and between C6ñC7 in the latter. These results\nsuggest that ArpO could be a dehydrogenase involved in\nthe oxidation of the piperidine ring leading to the pyridine\nring.\nMutants inarpK and arpX Genes\nArpK is highly similar to ﬂavin reductases and its coding gene is\nlocated upstream of arpHI. A mutant by gene replacement was\ngenerated in this gene (MARPK) using pHZMutorf9 ( Table 1\nand Supplementary Figure S19). This mutant showed a similar\nmetabolite proﬁle as the wild type strain, but argimycins PI/PII\nand argimycin PIV were not detected (Figures 2A,B). This result\nsupports the function of ArpK as regenerating ﬂavin nucleotides\nthat could be used by ArpO.\nDownstream of arpRII is located arpX that codes for a\nprotein of unknown function. A mutant by gene replacement\nwas generated using pHZMutorf14 ( Table 1 and Supplementary\nFigure S20). Analysis of the metabolite proﬁle of the resultant\nmutant MARPX showed that it produced diminished amounts\nof all argimycins P (Figure 2).\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 7 February 2018 | Volume 9 | Article 252\nfmicb-09-00252 February 15, 2018 Time: 16:25 # 8\nYe et al. Biosynthesis of Argimycins P\nCo-synthesis between Mutant Strains\nIn order to elucidate the order of the biosynthesis steps in\nargimycin P pathway, co-synthesis experiments were carried out\nbetween every mutant in arp structural gene and MARPPIII\n(PKS-minus mutant). No argimycin P containing two rings\nwere detected when MARPN, MARPDHI, or MARPDHII were\nco-cultivated with MARPPIII (data not shown). These results\nindicated that either compounds accumulated by these mutants\nwere not diﬀusible or unable to enter in the cell, or they were\nnot real biosynthesis intermediates. However, when MARPHI\nor MARPHII were co-cultivated with MARPPIII, formation\nof argimycin PV and argimycin PVI was detected, while\nnone of these compounds were produced by any of these\nmutants when grown individually ( Figure 5A ). This indicated\nthat these mutants accumulated biosynthesis intermediates\nthat were modiﬁed by MARPPIII leading to the formation\nof ﬁve-membered ring compounds. However, co-cultivation\nbetween MARPHI and MARPHII did not aﬀect argimycin P\nproduction proﬁles (data not shown). These results conﬁrm\nthat ArpN, ArpDHI, and ArpDHII were involved in earlier\nbiosynthesis steps, before formation of the ﬁve-membered ring,\nand strongly support that ArpHI and ArpHII would cooperate\nin the cyclization reaction leading to the formation of the ﬁve-\nmembered ring. On the other hand, by co-cultivating MARPO\nwith MARPPIII production of argimycin PI/PII was recovered,\nindicating that MARPO accumulated biosynthesis intermediates\nthat can be modiﬁed by an arpO expressing strain resulting in the\nformation of these two argimycins P (Figure 5B).\nBased on all these results, we propose a model for the\nbiosynthesis of argimycins P that can be divided into several\nstages (Figure 6). In the initial steps the piperideine ring would\nbe synthesized. The ArpPI, ArpPII, and ArpPIII PKS would\nrender the thioester hexaketide 1 according to the speciﬁcities\nof the PKS catalytic domains (Supplementary Figure S21).\nThis polyketide, similar to cyclizidine (Peng et al., 2016) and\ncoelimycin P (Awodi et al., 2017) biosynthesis pathways, would\nbe reductively released by the thioester reductase domain present\nin the PKS subunit ArpPIII to render the putative aldehyde 2.\nThen, transamination by aminotransferase ArpN of the aldehyde\ngroup of the released polyketide chain would occur rendering the\nhypothetical product 3, followed by its non-enzymatic cyclization\nto generate the putative biosynthesis intermediate 4 with a\npiperideine ring. Spontaneous dehydration and reduction of 4\nwould occur to provide nigrifactin.\nThe next step would be the formation of the piperidine ring.\nThis is supported by the fact that all mutants in arp genes\nexcept MARPDHII accumulate compounds with a piperidine\nring, which suggests the reduction of the imine group should be\nan early biosynthesis step. Most probably, this reaction would\noccur following the transamination reaction as it has been\nrecently reported in the cyclizidine biosynthesis pathway (Peng\net al., 2016). ArpDHII is proposed as a candidate to carry out\nthis imine reduction step. Unlike the proposed streptazone E\nbiosynthesis pathway (Ohno et al., 2015), neither nigrifactin nor\nargimycin PVII, PVIII, and PIX seem to be intermediates in\nthe biosynthesis of argimycins P containing two rings, since\nrecovery of its production was not achieved either in co-synthesis\nexperiments between mutants (e.g., MARPDHI or MARPDHII\nvs. MARPPIII), or in bioconversion experiments with nigrifactin\nby mutant MARPPIII. Therefore, formation of nigrifactin and\nits reduction to argimycin PVII would rather form part of\na biosynthesis side pathway leading to argimycin PVIII and\nPIX, while a diﬀerent intermediate should be used in the main\npathway leading to the formation of two rings-argimycins P. That\nintermediate could be the putative biosynthesis intermediate 4,\nthat after reduction by ArpDHII would generate the putative\nintermediate 5. This compound has not been identiﬁed so\nfar in cultures of S. argillaceus wild type or any arp mutant,\nhowever, structurally related compounds have been identiﬁed\nin other Streptomyces strains that also produce piperidine\npolyketide compounds (Puder et al., 2000; Groenhagen et al.,\n2014).\nFIGURE 5 | UPLC chromatograms of butanol extracts of co-synthesis products between S. argillaceusMARPPIII and different arp mutants.

R1 = OH and R2 = OH, argimycin PIV; R1 = H and R2 = OH, argimycin PV; R1 = H and R2 = H,\nargimycin PVI.\nFive-membered ring cyclization would be preceded by\nformation of biosynthesis intermediates containing epoxy\ngroups. This type of compounds (argimycin PX and PXI) is\nonly produced by mutants MARPHI and MARPHII. Since these\ntwo mutants co-synthesize with mutant MARPPIII, it is deduced\nthat compounds accumulated by these mutants are intermediates\nfor the biosynthesis of argimycins P containing two rings. It\nis proposed that ArpDHI would be involved in the formation\nof these epoxide containing compounds by oxidizing a putative\nintermediate with a double bond generated by spontaneous\ndehydration of compound 5. The next stage would be the ﬁve-\nmembered ring formation. According to our results and similarly\nto the streptazone E biosynthesis pathway (Ohno et al., 2015),\nthis cyclization event could be coupled to ring-opening of the\nepoxide, and would be carried out in a cooperative manner by\nArpHI and ArpHII.\nThe ﬁnal biosynthesis step would be formation of argimycins\nPI/PII that contain a pyridine ring and an N-acetylcysteine\nmoiety. It is proposed a role of ArpO (and ArpK) in formation\nof these compounds by oxidizing a biosynthesis intermediate\naccumulated by MARPO, including oxidation of the amino\ngroup to render the imine. This type of oxidation has already\nbeen reported in the biosynthesis of the alkaloid polyketide\nabikoviromycin by Tsuruoka et al. (1973), which puriﬁed an\noxidoreductase from its producer that carries out the oxidation\nof the amino group into the imine group of this compound.\nFurther attachment of N-acetylcysteine to the oxidized product\nsynthesized by ArpO would generate argimycins PI/PII. Most\nprobably, this would be a non-enzymatic event as it has\nbeen reported for the biosynthesis of other N-acetylcysteine-\ncontaining compounds (Suzuki et al., 2006; Gómez-Escribano\net al., 2012; Maier et al., 2014).\nRegulation of arp Gene Cluster\nThe arp gene cluster contains two cluster situated regulators\n(CSR; Huang et al., 2005): arpRI codes for a SARP-like\nactivator and its inactivation completely blocks argimycins P\nproduction; arpRII codes for a TetR-like repressor and its\ninactivation increases argimycins P production (Ye et al., 2017).\nTo conﬁrm their regulatory role, both genes were independently\noverexpressed into S. argillaceus and production of nigrifactin,\nargimycin PI/II, PV , and PVI was quantiﬁed in the resultant\nrecombinant strains and in regulatory mutant strains MARPRI\nand MARPRII as well (Supplementary Figure S22).

Biosynthesis of Argimycins P\nblocked in MARPRI, while it increased in MARPRII between 56\nand 259%, depending of the argimycin P analyzed. On the other\nhand, overexpression of arpRI (pSETEcRI) led to an increase\n(between 23 and 94%), and that of arpRII (pSETERII) to a\ndecrease (between 48 and 87%) in argimycins P production,\ndepending of the argimycin P quantiﬁed. These results conﬁrmed\nthe role of ArpRI and ArpRII as activator and repressor in\nargimycin P biosynthesis, respectively. In order to delve deeper\ninto their role in transcriptional regulation of arp cluster,\nexpression analysis of arp genes in these mutants was evaluated\nby RT-PCR. Total RNA was isolated from cultures ofS. argillaceus\nwild type strains and mutants MARPRI and MARPRII, after 24 h\nof growth. As shown inFigure 7A, all genes were expressed in the\nwild type strain including both regulatory genes. On the contrary,\nin MARPRI no transcripts were detected forarpO, arpDHI, arpN,\narpPI, arpPIII, and arpT. Noticeable, arpDHII, arpK, arpHI,\narpHII, arpPII, and arpX were still transcribed but at lower\nextent. This was conﬁrmed by qRT-PCR analyses that showed the\nexpression levels of these genes were lower in MARPRI in relation\nto the wild type strain (Figure 7B). This could be explained by the\nexistence of alternative promoters ArpRI-independent upstream\nof those genes. These results were consistent with the idea that\nArpRI was an essential regulator of argimycins P biosynthesis.\nIn MARPRII mutant, all arp genes were transcribed apparently\nat higher levels than in the wild type strain. One exception\nwas arpRII, since it was not transcribed ( Figure 7A). To better\nunderstand the relationship between both regulatory genes, qRT-\nPCR analyses of them were carried out in each regulatory mutant.\nAs observed in Figure 7C, expression of arpRI and arpRII was\nslightly lower in MARPRI, and expression of arpRI was higher\nFIGURE 7 | Gene expression analysis of the arp gene cluster.

Biosynthesis of Argimycins P\nand that of arpRII was much lower in MARPRII, in comparison\nto the wild type strain. Based on these results, we propose a model\nfor the regulation of argimycins P biosynthesis ( Figure 7D ),\nin which ArpRII positively controls expression of its coding\ngene and negatively controls expression of arpRI whose gene\nproduct in turn positively controls expression of all arp\ngenes.\nCONCLUSION\nWe have characterized the post-piperideine ring biosynthesis\nsteps of argimycins P , a group of piperidine-containing\npolyketides, signiﬁcantly broadening the knowledge about the\nbiosynthesis steps of this type of compounds and of its regulation.\nMoreover, we have pointed out important diﬀerences between the\nbiosynthesis pathway of argimycins P and that of the structurally\nrelated streptazone E. Thus, the arp cluster shows high synteny\nto other clusters in Streptomyces, such as the streptazone E gene\ncluster (stz) from Streptomyces sp. MSC090213JE08 (Ohno et al.,\n2015) (Supplementary Figure S23). Interestingly, Streptomyces\nsp. MSC090213JE08 does not produce the two ring-containing\nargimycins P but Streptazone E and in addition, S. argillaceus\nproduce a number of argimycins P (PVII to PXII) bearing a single\npiperidine ring, which have not been identiﬁed in cultures of\nStreptomyces sp. MSC090213JE08. These facts suggest diﬀerences\nbetween both pathways at diﬀerent levels. Thus, the hexaketides\nsynthesized by the Arp and the Stz PKS should be diﬀerent,\nsince module 5 from ArpPIII contains an inactive dehydratase\ndomain (Supplementary Figure S21), while the corresponding\nmodule from StzB contains an active one. Another diﬀerence\ncould be at the regulatory level. Transcriptional analyses of the\narp cluster have shown that some genes could be expressed from\ntwo diﬀerent promoters, an ArpRI-dependent and an ArpRI-\nindependent, which could account for higher expression of those\ngenes and consequently of the corresponding gene products.\nThe imine reductase arpDHII is one such gene and this could\npartially explain why most one ring-containing argimycins P\nso far identiﬁed in S. argillaceus contain a piperidine ring,\nwhile in the case of Streptomyces sp. MSC090213JE08 these\ncompounds contain a piperideine ring. In addition, diﬀerences\ncould exist at the enzymatic level. Thus, ArpO shows high\nsimilarity (80% identical aminoacids) to the FAD-dependent\nmonooxygenase StzK identiﬁed in the streptazone E gene cluster\n(Ohno et al., 2015). However, StzK has been involved in the\nformation of the epoxide ring which is later opened in the\ncyclization step to form the ﬁve-membered ring, while ArpO\nwould act after the ﬁve-membered ring was formed, oxidizing\nthe amino group. All these diﬀerences indicate that similar gene\nclusters can direct the biosynthesis of structurally similar but\ndiﬀerent compounds.\nOn the other hand, we have identiﬁed ﬁve new compounds\n(argimycins PVIII, PX, PXI, PXII, and PXIV) that can be\nexpanded to produce other analogs, and generated several mutant\nstrains that can be used as hosts to express genes from other\nbiosynthesis gene clusters (e.g., from other polyketide alkaloid\ngene clusters) and vice versa, the characterized arp coding genes\ncan be expressed in other producers to generate new potentially\nbioactive compounds (Méndez and Salas, 2003; Olano et al.,\n2014). Moreover,arp coding enzymes such as the ArpDHII imine\nreductase could contribute to extend the biocatalysis toolbox with\nnew enzymes with potential application to make pharmaceuticals\nand agrochemicals (Schrittwieser et al., 2015; Sigrist et al., 2015).\nAUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS\nCM and JS conceived and designed the project.

Huber3 & Harald Gröger1\nThe 3-thiazolidine ring represents an important structural motif in life sciences molecules.\nHowever, up to now reduction of 3-thiazolines as an attractive approach failed by means of\nnearly all chemical reduction technologies for imines. Thus, the development of an efﬁcient\ngeneral and enantioselective synthetic technology giving access to a range of such hetero-\ncycles remained a challenge. Here we present a method enabling the reduction of\n3-thiazolines with high conversion and high to excellent enantioselectivity (at least 96% and\nup to 99% enantiomeric excess). This technology is based on the use of imine reductases\nas catalysts, has a broad substrate range, and is also applied successfully to other\nsulfur-containing heterocyclic imines such as2H-1,4-benzothiazines. Moreover the efﬁency\nof this biocatalytic technology platform is demonstrated in an initial process development\nleading to 99% conversion and 99% enantiomeric excess at a substrate loading of 18 g/L in\nthe presence of designer cells.\nDOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-03841-5 OPEN\n1 Chair of Organic Chemistry I, Faculty of Chemistry, Bielefeld University, Universitätsstraße 25, Bielefeld 33615, Germany.2 Organic Chemistry II, Faculty of\nChemistry and Biochemistry, Ruhr-University Bochum, Universitätsstraße 150, Bochum 44801, Germany.3 Organic Chemistry I, Faculty of Chemistry and\nBiochemistry, Ruhr-University Bochum, Universitätsstraße 150, Bochum 44801, Germany.

In\nparticular, this is true for the 3-thiazolidine ring, which is\none of the two heterocyclic framework structures present in\npenicillins and penicillin-derived β-lactam antibiotic drugs such\nas amoxicillin\n1. The 3-thiazolidine moiety is also a structural\nmotif in a range of HIV protease inhibitors2 and an industrial key\nintermediate for the production of the non-proteinogenic amino\nacid D-penicillamine3 (Fig. 1). In addition, spiro-type 3-\nthiazolidines showed activity in human tumor cell lines4, and 3-\nthiazolidines with a less functionalized, alkyl-substitution pattern\nare of pharmaceutical interest with applications, e.g., as radio-\nprotective agents 5,6. Besides medicinal purpose, alkyl-\nfunctionalized 3-thiazolidines are reported to be relevant for the\nﬁelds of pesticides7 and ﬂavors8 (Fig. 1). Due to the importance of\nsuch molecules and the lack of ef ﬁcient general synthetic\napproaches, the search for attractive synthetic routes towards 3-\nthiazolidines (and other pharmaceutically interesting sulfur-\ncontaining cyclic amines such as 3,4-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzothia-\nzines9) is still ongoing. The development of a general and enan-\ntioselective synthetic platform technology giving access to a broad\nrange of such heterocycles independent of a speciﬁc substitution\npattern, thus enabling the design of libraries of such heterocycles,\nas well as efﬁcient processes for their production, would be par-\nticularly desirable.\nConceptually a substitution pattern independent access\ntowards 3-thiazolidines 2 can be proposed to proceed through\nreduction of the C=N double bond in the corresponding 3-\nthiazolines (1), which can be easily prepared through Asinger-\ntype multicomponent reaction10– 13. However, in spite of the\navailability of such attractive substrates, in all research work since\nthe 1950s the reduction of 3-thiazolines (1) failed by means of\nnearly all state of the art-type chemical reduction technologies for\nimines. Such non-successful attempts include numerous typical\nC = N double bond reduction technologies, which are known to\nwork well for many other imine substrate types. For example, the\nestablished hydrogenation technology (Pd/C, H2) was found at an\nearly stage not to be suitable due to catalyst poisoning by sul-\nfur13,14. These results are in accordance with later results by the\nFigueras group, ﬁnding that metals of supported metal catalysts\nbecome poisoned by sulfur15. The recently developed organoca-\ntalytic reduction with Hantzsch esters for imines16,17 also failed to\nlead the desired transformation due to lack of reactivity (Sup-\nplementary Figs.1, 2, Supplementary Table1 and Supplementary\nMethods). Other well-established reduction methods, such as\nsodium in alcohol, sodium in liquid ammonia or aluminum in the\npresence of potassium hydroxide or wet ether did not give clear\nresults13. When using metal hydrids, such as NaBH4 and LiAlH4,\nreduction works but is accompanied with an undesired ring-\nopening of theN,S-acetal moiety in the product2 (Supplementary\nFig. 2 and Supplementary Methods)13,14,18. The only exception is\na catecholborane-type reduction18, but in this case the yield was\nlow to moderate and enantioselectivity turned out to be poor with\nonly up to 4% enantiomeric excess (ee). In addition, a high-\ncatalyst loading, as well as an expensive and technically less\nfavored reducing agent (due to high ﬂammability) is needed.\nThus, the development of an efﬁcient general method for the\nreduction of 3-thiazolines ( 1) remained a challenge, as did\nestablishing an asymmetric catalytic version of this reaction.\nAttracted by the recent successful use of imine reductases\n(IREDs) for various reductions of cyclic imines19– 30, we became\ninterested in studying the suitability of this biocatalytic metho-\ndology for the reduction of 3-thiazolines (1) and other sulfur-\ncontaining cyclic imines such as 2H-1,4-benzothiazines (3).\nHere we report such a biocatalytic reduction which ﬁrstly\nenables a smooth reduction of 3-thiazolines ( 1) avoiding\nundesired ring-opening or other side reactions, secondly allows a\nhighly enantioselective synthesis of the resulting 3-thiazolidines\n(2) by means of such an approach starting from 3-thiazolines (1),\nand thirdly is a broadly applicable reduction platform for sulfur-\ncontaining heterocyclic imines including 3-thiazolines (1), as well\nas other sulfur-containing heterocyclic imines such as 2H-1,4-\nbenzothiazines (3).\nResults\nProof of concept for 3-thiazoline reduction. In initial experi-\nments, we tested whether IREDs are suitable biocatalysts for the\nreduction of 3-thiazolines (Fig.2). Although unknown for cyclic\nimines with additional heteroatoms, we focused on this enzyme\nclass instead of the so-called thiazolinyl IREDs since the latter\nenzymes (although bearing the term thiazolinyl imine in their\nname) are known to be substrate-speciﬁc for structurally highly\nfunctionalized 2-thiazolines reducing an imidothioester moi-\nety\n31,32, thus representing no promising option for developing a\nbroadly applicable synthetic platform for the reduction of the\nimine bond of 3-thiazolines. Toward this end, we prepared two\nnon-prochiral 3-thiazolines ( 1a and 1b) and screened them\nagainst a set of 31 IREDs, which had been prepared in a\nrecombinant form by means of overexpression inE. coli BL21\n(DE3)22,29. As a fast screening methodology a colorimetric pH\nshift assay33 developed by the Sieber group was used. This assay is\nbased on a pH shift (visualized by bromthymol blue), which is\ncaused by gluconic acid formed by consumption of the substrate\nand in situ-cofactor-regeneration (Fig.3, Supplementary Figs.3, 4\nand Supplementary Methods).\nColor changes from green to yellow were observed for both\nnon-prochiral 3-thiazolines 1a and 1b in combination with a\nrange of IREDs (Supplementary Table 2). Negative controls\nwithout an IRED showed no color change, indicating that the\nutilized glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) has no side-activity\ntoward such an imine reduction (in contrast to analogous\nreductions of other imines as reported in ref. 34). We\nsubsequently performed biotransformations at a substrate con-\ncentration of 20 mM of 3-thiazoline1b using two IREDs, which\nwere prioritized according to the results from the colorimetric pH\nshift assay. For in situ-cofactor regeneration, once again a GDH\nfrom Bacillus subtilis25,35 was used in combination withD-glucose\nas a co-substrate. After a reaction time of 24 h, formation of 3-\nthiazolidine 2b was demonstrated (Table1, entry 1), and revealed\nconversions of 29 and 83% with perfect product selectivity even\nunder non-optimized reaction conditions. Thus, these results\ndemonstrate that IREDs are suitable biocatalysts for the reduction\nof 3-thiazolines avoiding undesired ring-opening or other side\nreactions known for classic chemical and chemocatalytic reduc-\ntion methodologies.\nN\nS\nR\nHIV protease\ninhibitors\nAmoxicillin\nPenicillin\nantibiotics\nRadioactive agents\nPesticide\nintermediates\nIntermediate for\nD-penicillamine\nApplication areas of 3-thiazolidines\nFig. 1 Application areas of 3-thiazolidines.

Next, we focused on the study of\nthe substrate scope, as well as the determination of the enan-\ntioselectivity of these IRED-catalyzed reduction of 3-thiazolines.\nToward this end, we prepared a range of prochiral 3-thiazolines\n1c– 1f, comprising monocyclic andspiro-type compounds (Fig.3b\nand Table 1). Based on the results of the colorimetric pH shift\nassay for these 3-thiazolines (Supplementary Fig.4 and Supple-\nmentary Table 2), the speci ﬁc activities were determined by\nmeans of a spectrophotometric study, and it is noteworthy that\nactivities were found for all studied 3-thiazolines (Supplementary\nFigs. 5, 6 and Supplementary Table3). Utilizing the IREDs which\nshowed the highest speciﬁc activities, biotransformations of the\nprochiral 3-thiazolines running at a 20 mM substrate concentra-\ntion on a 10 mL scale and in situ-cofactor regeneration with a\nGDH were performed (Table 1, entry 2– 5). We found that for\neach substrate at least one IRED catalyzes the reduction with\ngood to excellent conversion (82 – 98%) under non-optimized\nreaction conditions (Table 1). Activity was higher when R 3\ncomprises methyl groups as substituents compared to the steri-\ncally less hindered hydrogen. Thus, when starting from prochiral\n3-thiazolines 1c and 1e, which bear hydrogens at R3, a higher\ntotal protein concentration of 5 mg mL−1 had to be used for\nachieving good conversions (Table1, entry 2, 4). In contrast, for\ngood to excellent conversions a much lower amount of IRED822\nwith a total protein concentration (crude extract) of 1.2 mg mL−1\nwas sufﬁcient when utilizing prochiral 3-thiazolines 1d and 1f\n(Table 1, entry 3, 5). Moreover, a higher activity of IRED822 as\nwell as conversion was found when using spiro-cyclic 3-\nthiazolidine 1e and 1f compared to the analogous 3-\nthiazolidines bearing methyl groups as substituents R2, 1c and\n1d. The highest activity of all tested 3-thiazolines could be\ndetermined with the spiro-cyclic compound 1f, which supports\nour observation that methyl groups at R3, as well as aspiro-cyclic\nscaffold as R2 substituents represent the best substitution pattern\nfor reduction of 3-thiazolines using IREDs. Negative controls of\nbiotransformations of 3-thiazolines without IRED again showed\nno conversion, indicating that the utilized GDH has no side-\nactivity towards this imine reduction. Furthermore, we found that\nIREDs catalyze the reduction of prochiral 3-thiazolines 1c– 1f\nwith high to excellent enantioselectivities (96– 99% ee) indepen-\ndent of the substituents R2 and R3 (Table 1, entry 2– 5), thus\nrepresenting the ﬁrst access to 3-thiazolidines with high-\nenantiomeric excess via reduction of the C= N double bond in\n3-thiazolines (1).

Due to the\nlack of availability of enantiomerically pure reference compounds\n(indicating the dif ﬁculty to access them by other synthetic\nmethods), we decided to determine the absolute conﬁguration of\n2f (obtained from the experiment at elevated lab scale as\ndescribed in section Process development on 3-thiazoline\nreduction) by vibrational circular dichroism (VCD) spectro-\nscopy. The experimental IR and VCD spectra of2f were recorded\nin choloroform and are shown in Fig.4a (for details, see Supple-\nmentary Methods). In order to simulate the spectra for the\nassignment of the conﬁguration, a conformational analysis was\ncarried out ﬁrst for (S)-2f at the MMFF level of theory using\nSpartan 14 software (Spartan 14, Wavefunction Inc., Irvine, CA,\nUSA (2014)). Subsequently, all eight obtained conformers were\nsubjected to further geometry optimizations followed by spectra\ncalculations at the B3LYP/6-311g ++ (2d,p)/IEFPCM(CHCl3)\nlevel of theory (using the software Gaussian 09 Rev. E01, Frisch,\nM.J. et al. Gaussian, Inc., Wallingford CT, USA, (2013)). The\nrelative Gibbs free energies ΔG298 K and the corresponding\nBoltzmann weights of the two populated conformers are shown in\nFig. 4b. Based on the single-conformer spectra, the IR and VCD\nspectra were simulated by assigning a Lorentzian band shape to\nthe dipole and rotational strength calculated for each conformer\nand subsequent Boltzmann-averaging of the spectra. Direct\ncomparison of the resulting simulated IR and VCD spectra with\nthe experimental data, as indicated by the assignments given in\nFig. 4a, reveals a very good agreement. Therefore, the absolute\nconﬁguration can be assigned with very high conﬁdence as (S)-2f.\nReduction of 2H-1,4-benzothiazines. Afterwards we studied\nfurther reductions using other sulfur-containing heterocyclic\nimines such as 2H-1,4-benzothiazines (3) as substrates (Fig.5),\nwhich have already been chemocatalytically reduced in an\nasymmetric fashion16,17,38. Therefore, the2H-1,4-benzothiazines\n3a– 3c were prepared. Among these compounds, the prochiral\nrepresentatives 3b and 3c contain either a methyl or phenyl group\nas substituents at R (Table2).

It turned out that the speciﬁc activity for 2H-1,4-\nbenzothiazines 3a and 3b were about 10-fold higher compared to\nthose for 3-thiazoline1f, which showed the highest activity of all\ntested 3-thiazolines. Moreover, the speciﬁc activities for prochiral\n2H-1,4-benzothiazine 3c, bearing a phenyl as substituent at the\nprochiral carbon atom, is also about 10-fold higher compared to\nthe 3-thiazolines 1a-e (Supplementary Figs. 6, 7 and Supple-\nmentary Table 3). Based on these encouraging enzyme activities,\nshowing high activity for 2H-1,4-benzothiazines also with steri-\ncally demanding substituents, as a next step synthetic bio-\ntransformations were carried out which also enabled us to gain\ninsight into the enantioselectivity of such reactions (Table 2).\nThese biocatalytic reductions were conducted at substrate con-\ncentrations of 20 mM on a 0.5 mL scale and the cofactor NADPH\nwas recycled in situ by means of a GDH andD-glucose (Fig. 5).\nUnder non-optimized reaction conditions all 2H-1,4-ben-\nzothiazines were converted to the corresponding 3,4-dihydro-\n2H-1,4-benzothiazines with moderate to good conversions of up\nto >99%, and most IREDs turned out to be suitable for catalyzing\nthese reactions. In accordance with the determined enzyme\nactivities, the amount of biocatalyst needed for the reduction of\n2H-1,4-benzothiazine 3c, comprising a phenyl group at R, was\nhigher compared to the one for 2H-1,4-benzothiazines with a\nmethyl group or a hydrogen atom at R (Table 2, entry 1– 3).\nNegative controls of biotransformations of2H-1,4-benzothiazines\nwithout IRED again showed no conversion, indicating that the\nutilized GDH has no side-activity toward this imine reduction.\nFurthermore, we found that IREDs catalyze the reduction of2H-\n1,4-benzothiazines with high to excellent enantioselectivities\n(83– 99% ee), and provided an access to both enantiomers of\nthe 3,4-dihydro-2H-1,4-benzothiazines with high enantiomeric\nexcess (Table2, entry 2– 3). Moreover, a higher enantioselectivity\nwas observed for the more sterically demanding substrate 3c,\ncomprising a phenyl group at R (with 99% ee), compared to the\n2H-1,4-benzothiazine 3b, comprising a methyl group at R (with\nup to 99% ee). The imine reductases IRED5, IRED28 and\nIRED2922,29 were identiﬁed as most suitable enzymes for the\nreduction of 2H-1,4-benzothiazine 3c bearing a phenyl group at\nR. Notably, in addition to all tested 3-thiazolines IRED822 turned\nout to be able to catalyze also the reduction of 2H-1,4-\nbenzothiazines 3a and 3c, thus representing an IRED being able\nto accept nearly all of the examined sulfur-containing heterocyclic\nimines.\nDFT studies. Taking into account the different activities of\nIREDs for 3-thiazolines (1) and 2H-1,4-benzothiazines (3) with\nhigher ones for the latter molecules, it is noteworthy that the\n(same) tendency is also observed for organocatalysts (being able\nto reduce 2H-1,4-benzothiazines (3) but not 3-thiazolines (1)\n(Supplementary Fig. 1, and Supplementary Methods)). In addi-\ntion, these ﬁndings are in accordance with observations of the\nTurner group, who found higher activities for six-membered\nrings compared to ﬁve-membered rings when examining the\nbiocatalytic reduction of cyclic imines20,23. Therefore, we were\ninterested in rationalizing this phenomena. Interestingly, both\nreduction methods are based on dihydropyridine moieties as\nreducing agents, namely the cofactor NADPH + H+ and a\nTable 1 Reduction of 3-thiazolines using imine reductases (IREDs)\nEntry 3-thiazoline substrate IRED a Conv.

The positive\nresults concerning IRED-catalyzed reduction of sulfur-containing\nheterocyclic imines motivated us to start a process development\nexempliﬁed by the enantioselective reduction of 3-thiazoline1f by\nmeans of IRED822 (Fig. 7a). Towards this end, in an analogy to\nour previous work25,35 an E. coli whole-cell catalyst was designed,\noverexpressing the prioritized IRED8 and a glucose dehy-\ndrogenase from Bacillus subtilis for in situ-cofactor recycling.\nBoth genes, encoding for IRED and GDH, respectively, have been\ninserted on different plasmids (Fig. 7b). Preparative scale\nexperiments (40 mL) were performed with a substrate con-\ncentration of 100 mM and a lyophilized whole-cell catalyst using\na Titrino apparatus to adjust the pH at 7 (Fig.7c). We found that\nthe reaction proceed smoothly also on preparative scale giving a\nvery high conversion (99%) and enantioselectivity (99% ee\nfor the S-enantiomer) within 30 h reaction time. After work up\nthe desired 3-thiazolidine ( S)-2f was isolated in 78% yield\n(Fig. 7a).\nIn summary, we reported a methodology which enables a\nreduction of 3-thiazolines under formation of the resulting 3-\nthiazolidines with high conversion and enantioselectivity of at\nleast 96% ee and up to 99% ee, avoiding undesired ring-opening\nor other side reactions. This process technology, which is based\non the use of IREDs as catalysts, has a broad substrate range and\nwas also applied successfully to other sulfur-containing hetero-\ncyclic imines such as 2H-1,4-benzothiazines. Furthermore, the\ntrends for the reduction of different substrates could be\nrationalized by molecular modeling and an initial process\ndevelopment was also conducted, demonstrating the suitability\nof this method for preparative use. In future work, the focus will\nbe on rationalizing the enzymatic reaction course and the\nenantioselectivity of this process by means of molecular\nmodeling.\nMethods\nBiotransformations of 3-thiazolines. Biotransformations of 3-thiazolines (which\nwere synthesized as described in Supplementary Methods; related NMR data are\nshown in Supplementary Figs.40– 55) were performed on 10 mL scale at 30 °C and\n500 r.p.m. in 100 mM KPi buffer pH 7, with 2% methanol as cosolvent containing\n40 mMD-glucose, 20 mM 3-thiazoline1a–f, 1.2 mg mL−1 (in case of substrate1d\nand 1f and IRED8) or 5 mg mL−1 IRED crude extract (in the other cases shown in\nTable 1, see Supplementary Table4, Supplementary Methods for codon-optimized\ngene sequences, protein sequences, Supplementary Figs.8– 38 for plasmid structures\nand Supplementary Fig.39 for SDS-Page), 24 U (in case of 1.2 mg mL−1 IRED) or\n100 U of GDH (in the other cases shown in Table1) and 0.1 mM NADP+. After\n24 h, the reaction was stopped by adding 200 µL of 32% NaOH solution and 10 mL\nof dichloromethane. Phase separation was promoted by centrifugation and the\nconversion was determined by analyzing the organic phase by means of achiral GC\n(Supplementary Figs.56– 60, Supplementary Table5 and Supplementary Methods;\nsynthesis of racemic 3-thiazolidine reference compounds is described in Supple-\nmentary Methods and related NMR data are shown in Supplementary Figs.61– 70).\nFor determination of the enantiomeric excess, samples were derivatized according\nto General Procedure 5 in the Supplementary Methods (NMR data of derivatized\nreferences are shown in Supplementary Figs.71– 78) and then analyzed by SFC-\nHPLC (Supplementary Figs.79– 82, Supplementary Table6 and Supplementary\nMethods).

Eikmanns4 & \nVolker F. Wendisch  1\nN-methylated amino acids are found in Nature in various biological compounds. N-methylation \nof amino acids has been shown to improve pharmacokinetic properties of peptide drugs due to \nconformational changes, improved proteolytic stability and/or higher lipophilicity. Due to these \ncharacteristics N-methylated amino acids received increasing interest by the pharmaceutical industry. \nSyntheses of N-methylated amino acids by chemical and biocatalytic approaches are known, but often \nshow incomplete stereoselectivity, low yields or expensive co-factor regeneration. So far a one-step \nfermentative process from sugars has not yet been described. Here, a one-step conversion of sugars \nand methylamine to the N-methylated amino acid N-methyl-l-alanine was developed. A whole-\ncell biocatalyst was derived from a pyruvate overproducing C. glutamicum strain by heterologous \nexpression of the N-methyl-l-amino acid dehydrogenase gene from Pseudomonas putida. As proof-\nof-concept, N-methyl-l-alanine titers of 31.7 g L\n−1 with a yield of 0.71 g per g glucose were achieved in \nfed-batch cultivation. The C. glutamicum strain producing this imine reductase enzyme was engineered \nfurther to extend this green chemistry route to production of N-methyl-l-alanine from alternative feed \nstocks such as starch or the lignocellulosic sugars xylose and arabinose.\nN-alkylation of amino acids occur in bacteria and eukaryotes. In green tea leaves, the N5-ethylated L-glutamine \nderivative theanine was shown to be responsible for their umami taste 1,2. N-methylated amino acids are also \nfound in depsipeptides that are used as drugs e.g. vancomycin, actinomycin D and cyclosporine. N-methylamino \nacid containing peptides often show higher stability against proteolytic degradation and/or increased membrane \npermeability as compared to non-methylated peptides3–5. Accordingly, the substitution of an N-terminal glycine \nresidue for sarcosine in an angiotensin II analog enhanced in vivo activity as a potential result of longer half-life \nagainst proteolytic degradation6. Similar to l-proline, N-methylated amino acids are known to stabilize discrete \nconformations of peptides as shown for the exchange of l-pipecolic acid by N-methyl-l-alanine in the ATPase \ninhibitor efrapeptin C7.\nIn certain bacteria, utilization of mono-methylamine (MMA) may lead to N-methylated amino acids. Some \nbacteria that can grow with reduced carbon substrates without carbon-carbon bonds such as methane or meth-\nanol can utilize MMA as sole source of carbon. The N-methylated amino acid N-methylglutamate occurs as an \nintermediate of the so-called monomethylamine catabolic pathway in representatives of these methylotrophic \nbacteria, e.g. Methylocella silvestris, Methyloversatilis universalis or Methylobacterium extorquens\n8–11.

An enzyme which catalyzes the reductive methylamination of pyruvate to NMeAla in the presence of \nMMA was isolated and named N-methylalanine dehydrogenase (Fig. 1)13. Based on its native function of reduc-\ning piperideine-2-carboxylate in addition to the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines this enzyme belongs to the \nclass of imine reductases (IREDs)14,15. The corresponding gene dpkA from Pseudomonas putida ATCC12633 was \nidentified and characterization of the encoded enzyme revealed a somewhat relaxed substrate spectrum. Since \nα-keto acids such as phenylpyruvate, ketohexanoate and ketoisobutyrate were accepted aside from pyruvate and \nthe enzyme also converts other alkylamines such as N-ethylamine, it was named N-methyl-l-amino acid dehy-\ndrogenase or NMAADH\n16–18. Reductive alkylamination of α-keto acids by DpkA using MMA appears similar to \nreductive amination by amino acid dehydrogenases using ammonium. Y et, the structure of DpkA shows similar-\nities to a new subclass of Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-dependent oxidoreductases \nwith the rare SESAS (seven-stranded predominantly antiparallel β-sheet) fold for NADPH-binding\n19. The physi-\nological role of NMAADH activity in pseudomonads, however, remains elusive.\nAlthough the formation of N-alkylated amino acids such as NMeAla has been shown during the character -\nization of NMAADH 16–18, efficient production via biocatalysis or by fermentation has not yet been described. \nBiocatalytic approaches may offer advantages over chemical methods such as N-alkylation of amino acids or the \nasymmetric Strecker synthesis since the chemical methods may use hazardous chemicals, give only incomplete \nstereoselectivity and low yields, while side reactions like dimethylation of the amino group may occur\n20.\nFermentative production of amino acids, mainly l-glutamate and l-lysine, occurs at the million-ton-scale21. \nFor more than fifty years, C. glutamicum has been used for the safe production of food and feed amino acids22,23. \nBesides the flavor enhancing l-glutamate24 and the feed additive l-lysine25, further amino acids and related com-\npounds can efficiently be produced by glucose- and ammonium-based fermentation using recombinant C. glu-\ntamicum strains\n26,27. Metabolic engineering of C. glutamicum has not been restricted to amino acids but also \nproduction of the α-keto acids pyruvate, ketoisovalerate and ketoisocaproate 28–31 were established. Taking the \nbroad substrate range of the NMAADH from P . putida into account, it is important to engineer a host such as C. \nglutamicum to overproduce only one α-keto acid, in this study pyruvate.\nHere we describe the one-step production of the N-methylated amino acid NMeAla from glucose and meth-\nylamine by a newly constructed C. glutamicum whole cell biocatalyst. The NMAADH gene dpkA from P . putida \nwas expressed in a pyruvate overproducing C. glutamicum strain31. This pyruvate producing strain, named ELB-P , \nis able to secrete up to 17.6 g L−1 pyruvate with low by-product formation in shake flasks31. To achieve high titers \nof pyruvate, the genome of this strain carries deletions of the genes encoding pyruvate-converting enzymes. \nFigure 1. Schematic overview of the reaction catalyzed by DpkA (A) and its integration into the central carbon \nmetabolism in C. glutamicum NMeAla1 (B). The gene deletions for improved pyruvate production are shown by \nblack arrows with red double bars: deletion of aceE (encoding PDHE1p, the E1p subunit of the PDHC) and pqo \n(encoding pyruvate-quinone oxidoreductase, PQO) and both genes coding both major enzymes for l-alanine \nsupply by pyruvate aminotransferases (alaT and avtA, encoding the alanine aminotransferase AlaT and the \nvaline-pyruvate aminotransferase AvtA, respectively) were deleted. In addition, the acetohydroxyacid synthase \n(AHAS) activity was downregulated by deletion of the C-terminal part of ilvN (small subunit of AHAS) shown \nby red dashed arrow. Enzymes highlighted by red background indicate missing or down regulated enzymes. The \nthick arrow displays the NMeAla formation by heterologous expressed dpkA from P . putida KT2440 coding for \nthe N-methylated amino acid dehydrogenase DpkA (green shadowed Enzyme).\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n3\nScIEntIfIc  REPORTS  |  (2018) 8:12895  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-31309-5\nStarting with a pyruvate dehydrogenase gene (aceE  encoding the E1p subunit) deficient strain 32, which accu-\nmulates high titers of pyruvate33, additional deletion of the pyruvate-quinone oxidoreductase gene ( pqo)34 and \ndeletion of the C-terminal regulatory domain of the acetohydroxyacid synthase gene (ilvN)35,36 further increased \npyruvate availability. To prevent the reduction of pyruvate to lactic acid, the ldhA (NAD-dependent l-lactic acid \ndehydrogenase)35 was deleted. Additionally, formation of the by-product l-alanine was reduced by deletion of the \nalanine aminotransferase gene (alaT) and valine-pyruvate aminotransferase gene (avtA)37 (Fig. 1). C. glutamicum \nELB-P requires acetate for biomass formation as consequence of the aceE deletion and uses glucose for produc-\ntion of pyruvate31,38. A derivative of C. glutamicum ELB-P expressing dpkA from P . putida was constructed here \nand demonstrated to be suitable for the one-step production of NMeAla from MMA and glucose or alternative \nfeedstocks.\nResults\nCorynebacterium glutamicum as suitable host for NMeAla production. To determine if C. glutami-\ncum is a suitable host for the production of the N -methylated amino acid NMeAla, the growth behavior of the \nwild type strain was analyzed under different conditions. To test whether C. glutamicum is able to utilize MMA or \nNMeAla as sole carbon or nitrogen source it was grown in minimal medium with either 50 mm MMA, NMeAla \nor glucose as sole carbon source or with either 50 mm MMA, 50 mm NMeAla or 30 mm ammonium sulfate and \n17 mm urea as nitrogen source. This growth experiment revealed that C. glutamicum could neither use MMA nor \nNMeAla as sole carbon or nitrogen source (data not shown).\nPossible effects due to substrate or product toxicity were detected in growth experiments with C. glutamicum \nwild type in minimal medium with glucose and increasing concentrations of MMA (0.05 m to 1.5 m) or NMeAla \n(0.05 m to 0.25 m). The growth rate was diminished at higher concentrations to about half-maximal rates at 1.8 m \nMMA and 0.4 m NMeAla, respectively (Fig. 2). In order to determine if MMA affects global gene expression in \nC. glutamicum, the transcriptomes were compared during growth in glucose minimal medium containing either \n250 mm MMA or 125 mm ammonium sulfate. The finding that very few genes changed expression and none had \na function in nitrogen metabolism (Supplementary Table) indicated that MMA does not elicit a specific gene \nexpression response.\nMetabolic engineering of C. glutamicum for fermentative production of NMeAla. The relatively \nsmall impacts of the substrate MMA and the product NMeAla on growth make C. glutamicum a suitable host \norganism for the fermentative production of NMeAla if a) sufficient pyruvate is available and b) NMeAla is trans-\nported out of the C. glutamicum cell. Therefore, the pyruvate overproducing C. glutamicum strain ELB-P\n31 was \nchosen as platform strain for engineering fermentative production of NMeAla. Since NMAADH activity had not \nbeen reported for C. glutamicum, the NMAADH gene dpkA from P . putida was cloned into the expression vec-\ntor pVWEx1 and used to transform C. glutamicum ELB-P (Fig. 1). The resulting strain ELB-P(pVWEx1-dkpA) \nwas designated as NMeAla1. Crude extracts of cells carrying either the empty vector or the dpkA  expression \nvector were assayed for reductive N-methylamination of pyruvate. As presumed, no activity was detected for \nC. glutamicum carrying the empty vector whereas a specific activity of 24 ± 1 mU (mg protein\n−1) for reductive \nN-methylamination of pyruvate was detected in the dpkA  expressing strain. This result indicates functional \nexpression of dpkA from P . putida in C. glutamicum.\nIn order to test C. glutamicum strain NMeAla1 for NMeAla production, the strain was cultivated in minimal \nmedium supplemented with 16.6 g L−1 potassium acetate, 2 mm l-Ala, 30 g L−1 glucose and 3.1 g L−1 MMA. HPLC \nanalysis of supernatants after cultivation for 72 h revealed that C. glutamicum NMeAla1 produced 7.6 ± 0.1 g L−1 \nNMeAla (Fig. 3). Only 0.2 ± 0.1 g L−1 pyruvate were produced, but the by-product l-alanine accumulated to con-\nsiderable concentrations (4.3 ± 0.9 g L−1; Fig. 3).\nFigure 2. Growth rates of C. glutamicum wild type in the presence of varying concentrations of MMA or \nNMeAla. C. glutamicum wild type was grown in presence of increasing MMA (0.05 m to 1.5 m) or NMeAla \n(0.05 m to 0.25 m) concentrations and specific growth rates were determined. Half maximal growth rates were \nobtained by extrapolation.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n4\nScIEntIfIc  REPORTS  |  (2018) 8:12895  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-31309-5\nImprovement of precursor conversion and reduction of by-product formation. The formation of \nl-alanine as by-product may be due to the high concentrations of ammonium sulfate and urea present as nitrogen \nsources in CGXII minimal medium. CGXII minimal medium was optimized for production of l -lysine which \ncontains two ammonium groups and reducing the nitrogen content in CGXII medium has previously been shown \nto improve production of l-proline and γ-aminobutyric acid that only contain a single ammonium group 39,40. \nFor production of NMeAla, MMA is used for reductive N-methylamination of pyruvate while ammonium sul-\nfate and urea are required solely to support biomass formation. Therefore, the nitrogen amount of the minimal \nmedium was reduced by half (2.5 instead of 5 g L−1 urea and 10 instead of 20 g L−1 ammonium sulfate) and to 10% \n(0.5 instead of 5 g L−1 urea and 2 instead of 20 g L−1 ammonium sulfate). Under the latter condition formation of \nthe by-product l-alanine was diminished, however, increased pyruvate concentrations and decreased NMeAla \nconcentrations in the supernatants indicated incomplete reductive N-methylamination of pyruvate to NMeAla \n(Fig. 3A). Subsequently, the MMA concentration was increased to 10.9 g L−1 and in addition the glucose concen-\ntration was reduced to 20 g L−1. As a result, only low concentrations of pyruvate, l -alanine and l -valine accu-\nmulated as by-products while a titer of 10.5  ± 0.4 g L−1 of NMeAla was obtained within 72  h (Fig. 3). To obtain \nan idea of the fate of carbon from glucose and acetate as substrates the concentrations of carbon present in the \nbiomass and products formed were plotted (Fig.  3B). While E. coli shows overflow metabolism at high glucose \nconcentrations, C. glutamicum does not\n22,23. Specifically, the strain used here did neither secrete acetate nor lactate \ndue to gene deletions introduced by metabolic engineering (ΔaceE, Δpqo, ΔldhA). As expected for aerobic pro-\ncesses, about 50% of carbon from the growth substrates will end up in CO2. For example under the condition with \n20 g L−1 glucose and 16.6 g L−1 potassium acetate (together 12 g carbon L−1), 11% carbon was found in biomass, \n2% in L-alanine, 1% in L-valine, 1% in pyruvate and 31% NMeAla, while CO2 formation likely explains the fate \nof 55% of the carbon.\nFigure 3. NMeAla, l-alanine, l-valine and pyruvate production data (A) and carbon balance (B) of C. \nglutamicum strain NMeAla1 under different conditions. Cells were cultivated in minimal medium CGXII \ncontaining 30 g L−1 or 20 g L−1 glucose and 16.6 g L−1 potassium acetate, 2 mm l-Ala and 1 mm IPTG for \ninduction of gene expression. The nitrogen amount of the minimal medium was reduced to 50% or 10% \nrespectively, the glucose and MMA amount were optimized to finally 20 g L\n−1 glucose and 10.9 g L−1 MMA. The \nculture supernatants were harvested after incubation for 72 h and analyzed by HPLC. (A) Concentrations are \ngiven as means with standard deviation of three replicates. n.d.: not detected. (B) To assess the fate of carbon \nfrom glucose and acetate as substrates their concentrations in gram carbon per liter is plotted. The gram carbon \nper liter concentrations of biomass formed (green) and of the formed products l-alanine (blue), l-valine \n(black), pyruvate (grey), and NMeAla (red) are plotted. For NMeAla, the carbon derived from MMA was not \nconsidered. The gram carbon per liter concentrations of CO\n2 and unknown byproducts are depicted in open \ncolumns. Amines < 0.1 g L−1 and carbohydrates < 0.5 g L−1 were not considered.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n5\nScIEntIfIc  REPORTS  |  (2018) 8:12895  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-31309-5\nThus, after balancing concentrations of the nitrogen and carbon sources for growth (ammonium sulfate, urea \nand acetate) with the substrates for production (glucose and MMA), NMeAla was produced by fermentation \nusing C. glutamicum strain ELB-P(pVWEx1-dkpA) with a volumetric productivity of 0.15 g L−1 h−1 and a yield \nof 0.53 g g−1 glucose.\nFed-Batch bioreactor process of NMeAla production. To evaluate an enhancement of NMeAla \nproduction by feeding glucose and MMA a fed-batch cultivation in 4 L scale (initial volume) was performed. \nFor higher cell density and higher production titers the fed-batch cultivation was performed with two inde -\npendent feed phases (Fig.  4). The first feeding solution contained acetate and was coupled to the relative dis -\nsolved oxygen saturation (rDOS) signal with the intent to increase the biocatalyst concentration and to improve \ngrowth-associated production of NMeAla. The second feeding phase started after 22 h with an initial supply \nof 162 mL followed by a linear feed (12.3  mL h−1) of glucose and MMA (ratio 1:3) to boost growth-decoupled \nproduction of NMeAla. At the end of the fed-batch bioreactor process (98 h) 86.7 g acetate and 178.8 g glucose \nwere consumed and the residual glucose concentration was 16.3 g L−1. A yield of 0.48 g NMeAla per g of acetate \nand glucose was achieved. Considering that growth of C. glutamicum NMeAla1 depends on acetate whereas \nproduction does not, a product yield on glucose was calculated to be 0.71 g g−1 glucose at a final titer of 31.7 g L−1 \nNMeAla and a volumetric productivity of 0.35 g L−1 h−1. The side-product l-alanine and the precursor pyruvate \nonly accumulated to low concentrations (0.5 g L−1 and 2.1 g L−1, respectively). Thus, fermentative production of \nNMeAla in a fed-batch process resulted in enhanced final titer, volumetric productivity and yield in comparison \nto shake flask experiments.\nEstablishing production of NMeAla from alternative feedstocks. Sustainable production from \nsugars that have competing uses in human and animal nutrition have to be succeeded by production processes \nbased on second generation feedstocks such as lignocellulosic hydrolysates. Fermentative production of amino \nacids is typically based on glucose present in molasses or obtained from starch by hydrolysis. Direct utilization \nof starch as well as of the pentose sugars xylose and arabinose that can be obtained by hydrolysis of lignocellu-\nlosics required metabolic engineering of C. glutamicum\n41. Based on these strategies the C. glutamicum strains \nNMeAla1(pEXCT99A-amyA), NMeAla1(pEKEx3-xylAXc-xylBCg), and NMeAla1(pEXCT99A-araBAD) were con-\nstructed and tested for production of NMeAla from starch, arabinose and xylose, respectively. Upon expression of \nthe α-amylase gene amyA from Streptomyces griseus, C. glutamicum can utilize starch\n42 and C. glutamicum strain \nNMeAla1(pEXCT99A-amyA) produced 7.5 ± 0.1 g L−1 NMeAla in minimal medium containing 30 g L−1 starch \nand 16.6 g L−1 potassium acetate (Fig.  5). Heterologous expression of the arabinose utilization operon araBAD  \nfrom E. coli enables C. glutamicum to utilize arabinose as carbon and energy source 43,44. C. glutamicum strain \nNMeAla1(pEXCT99A-araBAD) produced 4.2 ± 0.5 g L−1 NMeAla in minimal medium containing 30 g L−1 arab-\ninose and 16.6 g L−1 potassium acetate (Fig. 5). Efficient utilization of the lignocellulose pentose sugar xylose was \nenabled by expression of the xylose isomerase gene xylA from Xanthomonas campestris combined with overex-\npression of the endogenous xylulokinase gene xylB45. In CGXII minimal medium containing 30 g L−1 xylose and \n16.6 g L−1 potassium acetate, C. glutamicum strain NMeAla1(pEKEx3-xylAB) produced 7.0 ± 0.1 g L−1 of NMeAla \n(Fig. 5). Taken together, efficient production of NMeAla from three alternative feedstocks was shown.\nFigure 4. Fed-batch cultivation with C. glutamicum NMeAla1 in minimal medium supplemented with \npotassium acetate and glucose as carbon and energy sources. A fermenter with an initial start volume of 4 L was \nused. First feed phase (potassium acetate) was coupled to the rDOS value. After 22 h the second feed phase was \nstarted by the initial addition of 162 mL of a glucose/MMA solution followed by a linear feed of 12.3 mL h−1. \nThe biomass formation (black open squares), concentrations of NMeAla (red circles), l-alanine (blue squares), \npyruvate (grey squares), acetate (green filled triangles) and glucose (green open triangles) were depicted. The \nvolume of both feeds is shown as black lines. All depicted concentrations and the biomass formation was related \nto the initial volume.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n6\nScIEntIfIc  REPORTS  |  (2018) 8:12895  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-31309-5\nDiscussion\nFermentative access to the N-methylated amino acid NMeAla was achieved by introduction of the NMAADH \ngene dpkA from P . putida into the pyruvate overproducing C. glutamicum strain ELB-P . N-methyl-l-alanine titers \nof 31.7 g L−1 with a yield of 0.71 g per g glucose were achieved in fed-batch cultivation. The described C. glutami-\ncum strains allow, to the best of our knowledge, the first fermentative production of NMeAla reported to date. \nDi-N-methyl-l-alanine, a frequent by-product in chemical methylation of l-alanine, was not observed. However, \npyruvate and l-alanine accumulated as minor by-products.\nl-Alanine was also a by-product of pyruvate 31 and l-serine production 46 although the genes alanine ami-\nnotransferase (alaT) and valine-pyruvate aminotransferase (avtA) have been deleted. Thus, at least one further \nl-alanine forming transaminase must be active in C. glutamicum.\nAbolishing export of pyruvate and l-alanine was not possible since the export systems have not been iden-\ntified. Deletion of export genes has been shown to be valuable to improve production of γ -aminobutyric acid \n(deletion of cgmA to abolish putrescine export) 47, 5-aminovalerate and ectoine (deletion of lysine export gene \nlysE)48–50. As is the case for l -alanine, the export system for NMeAla is unknown. Given their similar struc-\nture it is conceivable that both l -alanine and NMeAla are exported by the same unknown export system. \nAlternatively, NMeAla may be substrate of the export system of C. glutamicum for branched-chain amino acids \nand l-methionine BrnEF51–53. The transcriptional regulator Lrp is activating transcription of brnFE at elevated \nintracellular concentrations of branched-chain amino acids and l-methionine54. Since N-methylation increases \nlipophilicity55,56, diffusion of the more lipophilic NMeAla across the cytoplasmic membrane of C. glutamicum is \nmore relevant as compared to l-alanine. However, diffusion of amino acids across the cytoplasmic membranes \nof bacteria cannot explain transport processes against concentration gradients which require active transport \nsystems. This not only holds true for charged amino acids such as l-lysine57, but also for uncharged amino acids \nsuch as l-isoleucine51,52. Future work will have to unravel the export systems of NMeAla, l-alanine and pyruvate \nin C. glutamicum.\nIn contrast, uptake of MMA into the C. glutamicum  cell has been studied to some detail. The uncharged \nammonia (NH3) is able to diffuse across the membrane, but its protonated form ammonium (NH4\n+) is actively \nimported by the transport proteins AmtA and AmtB58,59. Notably, as a probe for ammonium uptake, 14C-labelled \nMMA was used to determine uptake rates. Ammonium uptake in enteric bacteria such as E. coli operates by a \ncomparable mechanism as shown for E. coli protein AmtB\n60.\nThe one-step process of NMeAla production will benefit from more efficient reductive N -methylamination \nof pyruvate by increasing the amount and/or the activity of NMAADH. Here, the NMAADH gene dpkA  was \ncloned into the medium copy vector pVWEx1 and transcription initiated from the IPTG inducible promoter Ptrc \nand translation initiated from a standard ribosome binding site. Thus, as shown for expression of other genes in \nrecombinant C. glutamicum, dpkA expression may benefit from the choice of the expression vector, the promoter \nand the ribosome binding site\n61–64.\nEngineering of DpkA for more efficient reductive N-methylamination of pyruvate to yield NMeAla will also \nincrease fermentative NMeAla production. The NMAADH DpkA used here for reductive N -methylamination \nof pyruvate has been shown to be part of the d -lysine degradation pathway in pseudomonads where it acts as \nimine reductase (IRED) reducing its native substrate piperideine-2-carboxylate 18. IREDs that catalyze the \nasymmetric reduction of prochiral imines to chiral amines by using NAD(P)H as a hydride source are gain-\ning increasing interest in bioorganic chemistry65–68. The substrate range is not restricted to cyclic imines and as \nshown for DpkA16–18, the (S)-selective IRED from Streptomyces sp . GF354669 and the (R)-selective IRED from \nStreptosporangium roseum70 also catalyze asymmetric reductive amination from suitable ketone and amine pre-\ncursors. The latter reaction is expected to proceed via an imine either in solution or in the active site of the \nenzyme. Structure-function analysis of DkpA and other IREDs to improve asymmetric reductive amination from \nsuitable ketone and amine precursors has not yet been described, but would be valuable to increase reductive \nN-methylamination of pyruvate to NMeAla by DkpA or derived variants. This approach has successfully been \napplied to the P450 oxidoreductase BM3 from B. megaterium\n71. By mutagenesis the enzyme was engineered to \noxidize not only fatty acids72, but also N-alkanes73,74, the more sterically demanding β -ionone75, indole76,77 and \nothers.\nFigure 5. Production of NMeAla from alternative carbon sources. The CGXII minimal medium with 16.6 g L−1 \npotassium acetate contained 30 g L−1 starch for cultivation production experiments using C. glutamicum strain \nNMeAla1(pECXT99A-amyA), 30 g L−1 arabinose using C. glutamicum strain NMeAla1(pECXT99A-araBAD) \nand 30 g L−1 xylose using C. glutamicum strain NMeAla1(pEKEx3-xylAB). Concentrations were determined \nafter 72 h and are given as means with standard deviations of three replicates.\nwww.nature.com/scientificreports/\n7\nScIEntIfIc  REPORTS  |  (2018) 8:12895  | DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-31309-5\nHere, we have developed a fermentative route to the N -methylated amino acid NMeAla. The biocatalytic \nroute was based on N-methyl-l-amino acid dehydrogenase (NMAADH), which was integrated into the central \nmetabolism of a pyruvate overproducing C. glutamicum strain. A final NMeAla titer of 31.7 g L−1 was achieved in \nfed-batch fermentation after balancing the ratio of the major substrates glucose and MMA. Additionally, NMeAla \nproduction from the alternative carbon sources xylose, arabinose and starch was enabled, thus, providing the \nbasis for sustainable NMeAla production from second generation feedstocks.\nExperimental\nBacterial strains and growth conditions. The strains and plasmids used in this study are listed in Table 1. \nE. coli DH5α78 was used for vector construction. C. glutamicum pre-cultures were grown in Lysogeny Broth (LB) \nmedium containing 7 g L−1 sodium acetate in 500 mL baffled flask at 30 °C inoculated from a fresh LB agar plate. \nWhen necessary, the medium was supplemented with kanamycin (25 µg mL−1), spectromycin (100 µg mL−1) and/or \ntetracyclin (5 µg mL−1). The gene expression from the vectors pVWEx1, pEKEx3 and pECXT99A was induced by \nadding Isopropyl-β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) (1 mm). For growth experiments or fermentative produc-\ntion of C. glutamicum cells were incubated in LB medium containing 7 g L−1 sodium acetate overnight on a rotary \nshaker, harvested (4000 × g, 7 min) and washed with TN buffer pH 6.3 (50 mm TrisHCl, 50 mm NaCl). The cells \nwere inoculated to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 1 in 50 mL CGXII minimal medium22 supplemented with \n40 g L−1 glucose (wild type) or with blends of 20 or 30 g L−1 glucose, 16.6 g L−1 potassium acetate and 2 mm L-alanine \n(ELB-P). Growth in 500 mL baffled flasks was followed by measuring the OD600 using V-1200 Spectrophotometer \n(VWR, Radnor, PA, USA). The Biolector microfermentation system (m2p-labs, Aachen, Germany) was used for \ndetermination of the growth behavior in the presence of MMA or NMeAla and the carbon and nitrogen source \ngrowth tests. The shaking frequency was adjusted to 1200 rpm and 48-well flower plate wells with cultivation vol-\numes of 1 mL were used and growth was followed by backscattered light at 620 nm and a signal gain factor of 20.\nFed-Batch cultivation. Fermentation of C. glutamicum NMeAla1 was performed in an initial working \nvolume of 4 L in a bioreactor (7 L NLF , Bioengineering AG, Switzerland) at 30 °C, 0.2 bar overpressure, and an \naeration rate of 5 NL min−1. Stirrer speed was controlled to maintain relative dissolved oxygen saturation at 30% \nduring growth phase. Due to controlled addition of KOH (4 m) and phosphoric acid (10% (w/w)) the pH was \nmaintained at 7.0. To avoid foaming the antifoam Struktol® J647 was added manually when necessary. The first \nfeeding phase with 26.7 g L−1 potassium acetate solution (total volume: 500 mL) was depending on the relative \ndissolved oxygen saturation, it was activated when the rDOS signal rose above 60% and stopped when rDOS felt \nbelow 60%. The second feeding phase (164 g L\n−1 glucose and 84 g L−1 MMA (total volume: 1000 mL)) was started \nmanually after 22 h. Samples were taken automatically every 2 hours within the first 24 h and every 8 hours after-\nwards and cooled to 4 °C until analysis. For fermentation a modified CGXII minimal medium was used: 5 g L−1 \n(NH4)2SO4, 1.25 g L−1 urea, 1 g L−1 K2HPO4, 1 g L−1 KH2PO4, 5 g L−1 yeast extract in addition to the same concen-\ntrations of trace elements and vitamins as described elsewhere18. Modified CGXII was supplemented with 15 g L−1 \nKAc, 20 g L−1 glucose, 9.3 g L−1 MMA and 25 µg mL−1 kanamycin. The fermenter was inoculated by addition of \n450 mL of a shake flask culture grown in the described media with extra 42 g L−1 MOPS buffer.\nMolecular genetic techniques and strain construction. The standard molecular genetic techniques were  \nperformed as described in Grenn and Sambrook, 2012. Transformation of E. coli DH5 α78 was performed  \nby heat shock79, plasmid DNA transfer into C. glutamicum by electroporation 22.The gene dpkA was amplified  \nfrom P . putida KT2440 genomic DNA by using the primers dpkA-fw (GCCAAGCTTGCATGCCTGCAGA  \nAAGGAGGCCCTTCAGATG TCCGCACCTTCCACCAG) and dpkA-rv (GGGATCCTCTAGAGTCGACCT  \nGCATCAGCCAAGCAGCTCTTTCA); dpkA-fw carries the RBS sequence (italicized).

The vector pVWEx1 was restricted  \nwith BamHI and incubated in a Gibson assembly 80 with the PCR product for construction of plasmid  \npVWEx1-dpkA  which was used to transform C. glutamicum strains. For construction of the expression  \nplasmid harboring the genes for arabinose degradation araBAD  from E. coli  was amplified using  \ngenomic DNA of E. coli MG1655 with the primers araBAD-fw (CATGGAATTCGAGCTCGGTACCC  \nGGGGAAAGGAGGCCCTTCAGATG GCGATTGCAATTGGCCT) and araBAD-rv (GCCTGCAGGTCG  \nACTCTAGAGGATCTTACTGCCCGTAATATGCCT); araBAD-fw carries the RBS sequence (italicized). The \nvector pECXT99A was incubated with BamHI for restriction and incubated with the PCR product in an Gibson \nassembly\n80 for plasmid construction. The constructed plasmid was used to transform C. glutamicum strains.\nCrude extract preparation and enzyme assays. Cells for crude extracts were inoculated as described \nabove and harvested after 20 h and stored at −20 °C. From this step cell pellets and crude extract were handled \nat 4 °C or on ice. 150 to 200 mg cells were resuspended in 1 mL 100 mm glycine buffer (pH 10) and sonicated (UP \n200 S, Dr. Hielscher GmbH, Teltow, Germany) at an amplitude of 60% and a duty cycle of 0.5 for 9 min. Protein \nconcentration of the cell free extracts obtained by centrifugation (20200 × g, 30 min, 4 °C) was determined by the \nBradford method81 with bovine serum albumin as reference.\nFor determination of the reductive N -methylamination activity the assay was performed as described 18. In \na total volume of 1  mL containing 100  mm glycine buffer (pH 10), 60  mm MMA, 10 mm pyruvate and 0.3  mm \nNADPH the consumption of NADPH (epsilon = 6200 L mol−1 cm−1) was detected at 340 nm at 30 °C for 3 min. \nThe assay was performed in at least triplicates.\nQuantification of amino acids and organic acids. Extracellular amino acids and pyruvate were quan-\ntified by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (1200 series, Agilent Technologies Deutschland \nGmbH, Böblingen, Germany). The culture supernatants were collected and centrifuged (20200 × g, 15 min) for \nfurther analysis.\nFor the detection of NMeAla and l -alanine the samples were derivatised with 9-fluorenylmethyl chloro -\ncarbonate (Fmoc-Cl) according to published methods\n82 with modifications 39. l-proline was used as internal \nstandard. The separation was carried out by a reversed phase HPLC using a pre-column (LiChrospher 100 RP8 \nEC-5 μ (40 mm × 4.6 mm), CS-Chromatographie Service GmbH, Langerwehe, Germany) and a main column \n(LiChrospher 100 RP8 EC-5 μ (125 mm × 4.6 mm), CS Chromatographie Service GmbH). The detection was per-\nformed with a fluorescence detector (FLD G1321A, 1200 series, Agilent Technologies) with the excitation and \nemission wavelength of 263 nm and 310 nm respectively.\nAnalysis of l-valine was performed by an automatic pre-column derivatization with ortho-phthaldialdehyde \n(OPA)\n83 and separated on a reversed phase HPLC using pre- and main column (LiChrospher 100 RP8 EC-5μ , \n125 mm × 4.6 mm, CS Chromatographie Service GmbH) with l-asparagine as internal standard. Detection of the \nfluorescent derivatives was carried out with a fluorescence detector with an excitation wavelength of 230 nm and \nan emission wavelength of 450 nm. Concentrations exceeding 0.1 g L−1 were considered further.\nPyruvate, acetate and glucose concentrations were measured with an amino exchange column (Aminex, \n300 mm × 8 mm, 10 μm particle size, 25 Å pore diameter, CS Chromatographie Service GmbH) under isocratic \nconditions for 17 min at 60 °C with 5 mm sulfuric acid and a flow rate of 0,8 mL min−1. The detection was carried \nout with a Diode Array Detector (DAD, 1200 series, Agilent Technologies) at 210 nm. Concentrations exceeding \n0.5 g L−1 were considered further.\nTranscriptome analysis using DNA microarrays. For the transcriptome analysis in the presence of \nMMA, C. glutamicum wild type cells were grown in minimal medium supplemented with 250 mm MMA or \n125 mm ammonium sulfate to exponential growth phase and harvested at an OD600 of 4. The RNA was isolated \nand transcriptome analysis using whole genome microarrays were performed as described previously84.\nData availability.

Schrittwieser,* [a] and\nWolfgang Kroutil [a]\nImine reductases (IREDs) have recently become a primary focus\nof research in biocatalysis, complementing other classes of\namine-forming enzymes such as transaminases and amine\ndehydrogenases. Following in the footsteps of other research\ngroups, we have established a set of IRED biocatalysts by\nsequence-based in silico enzyme discovery. In this study, we\npresent basic characterisation data for these novel IREDs and\nexplore their activity and stereoselectivity using a panel of\nstructurally diverse cyclic imines as substrates. Specific activities\nof >1 U/mg and excellent stereoselectivities ( ee >99 %) were\nobserved in many cases, and the enzymes proved surprisingly\ntolerant towards elevated substrate loadings. Co-expression of\nthe IREDs with an alcohol dehydrogenase for cofactor regener-\nation led to whole-cell biocatalysts capable of efficiently\nreducing imines at 100 mM initial concentration with no need\nfor the addition of extracellular nicotinamide cofactor. Prepara-\ntive biotransformations on gram scale using these ‘designer\ncells’ afforded chiral amines in good yield and excellent optical\npurity.\nIntroduction\nChiral amines form the core structure of numerous natural\nproducts and are also present in many synthetic bioactive\nmolecules. According to recent estimates, approximately 40 %\nof active pharmaceutical ingredients and 20 % of agrochemicals\ncontain a chiral amine moiety.\n[1] The paramount importance of\nthis class of substances has led to the development of\nnumerous strategies for their asymmetric synthesis, [1b,2] of which\nbiocatalytic methods have attracted increased interest in recent\nyears.\n[1a,3] The established approaches in this context, such as\nthe kinetic resolution of racemic amines using lipases, [4] the\nasymmetric reductive amination of prochiral ketones using\ntransaminases,[5] and the chemo-enzymatic deracemisation of\namines employing amine oxidases in combination with chem-\nical reducing agents, [1a,6] have recently been supplemented by\nbiocatalytic imine reduction as a novel, intensively investigated\nstrategy for chiral amine synthesis.\n[7] In particular, the discovery\nin 2010 of natural imine reductases (IREDs) [8] – an enzyme class\ncapable of reducing cyclic imines at the expense of a\nnicotinamide cofactor – has sparked immense research efforts\ndirected at identifying and characterising a larger number of\nthese novel enzymes, and applying them in organic synthesis.\nOver the last seven years, a large number of imine\nreductases have been identified and heterologously expressed,\nand their substrate scope, their kinetic properties, their three-\ndimensional structure and their applicability in preparative-\nscale reactions have been investigated. [8–9] Both ( R)- and ( S)-\nselective IREDs are relatively common in bacteria (particularly in\nactinomycetes) and all known members of this enzyme family\nshare the same overall structure: a dimer formed through\nreciprocal domain swapping between two monomers that\nconsist of an N-terminal, cofactor-binding Rossmann fold motif\nand a helical C-terminal domain. The preferred cofactor is\ngenerally NADPH, but it has been shown that structure-guided\nprotein engineering can be used to increase the specific activity\nof IREDs towards the non-phosphorylated nicotinamide cofac-\ntor (NADH).\n[9a,n] Moreover, it has been found that IREDs are not\nlimited to reducing cyclic imines but that they are also capable\nof coupling carbonyl compounds and amines in a reductive\namination reaction, albeit at often drastically reduced\nrates.[9b,g–j,s,w,z] While most IREDs seem to rely on spontaneous\nimine formation from the amine and carbonyl substrates when\nperforming such reductive aminations, a sub-class of the IRED\nfamily, termed ‘reductive aminases’, has been found capable of\ncatalysing the imine formation step as well.\n[9c,10] Biocatalytic\ncascade systems in which IREDs are combined with other\nenzymes to achieve deracemisation of cyclic amines [9o] or their\nasymmetric synthesis from open-chain precursors [9e,m] have also\nbeen developed. However, reports on the preparative applica-\ntion of IRED-catalysed reductions have remained comparably\nscarce.\nThe first two members of the IRED family (included for\ncomparison in the present study as IRED- A and IRED- I,s e e\n[a] S.

[8] The\ncloning and sequencing of the genes encoding these proteins\nhas paved the way for subsequent enzyme discovery efforts\nfocused on identifying homologues of the original IREDs in\npublic databases using a sequence-based bioinformatics ap-\nproach. A result of these efforts is the establishment of the Imine\nReductase Engineering Database(https://ired.biocatnet.de/), main-\ntained by researchers from the University of Stuttgart,\n[9aa,11] which\ncurrently (version 3, accessed 15 March 2018) contains more\nthan 1400 sequences of putative IREDs. The wealth of sequence\ninformation in this database has been used as the basis for\ndetailed bioinformatics analyses,\n[11] but only a small fraction of\nthe listed enzymes has actually been studied at the protein level.\nHerein, we report the sequence-based in-silico discovery\nand characterisation of eight novel imine reductases along with\nthe investigation of six known IREDs, all of which are also\ncontained in the Imine Reductase Engineering Database. More-\nover, we report on the application of these enzymes in the\nasymmetric reduction of cyclic imines, employing an alcohol\ndehydrogenase as auxiliary enzyme and isopropanol as co-\nsubstrate for cofactor regeneration. Finally, we demonstrate\nthat by employing an E. colistrain that co-expresses the alcohol\ndehydrogenase and a suitable IRED, preparative-scale reduc-\ntions of imines at elevated substrate concentration are possible\nwithout the need for addition of NADP\n+.\nResults and Discussion\nSequence-based In-silico Enzyme Discovery\nWhen we started our investigations in late 2013, the Imine\nReductase Engineering Database had not yet been established.\nWe therefore followed our own sequence-based approach for\nthe in-silico discovery of putative IREDs, which we based on\noverall protein sequence homology to the four confirmed IREDs\nknown at that time (IREDs A, B, I and K; see Table 1) and on the\npresence of specific active-site key residues. The first X-ray\ncrystal structure of an IRED (Q1EQE0, IRED- B; PDB 3zgy, 3zhb)\nhad just been solved and published by Grogan and co-workers\na few months earlier, and their results suggested that an\naspartic acid residue, D187 (IRED- B numbering), was crucial for\nthe imine reductase activity of the protein, supposedly playing\na role in substrate protonation.\n[9ad] A tyrosine residue, Y169\n(IRED-I numbering), is present in the corresponding position of\nthe ( S)-selective IREDs I and K and can be assumed to serve the\nsame function as D187 in the ( R)-selective Q1EQE0 enzyme. On\nthe basis of this limited structural and functional information\nwe decided to search the UniProt database for protein\nsequences that ( i) scored an E-value of /C20 10/C0 50 in a protein\nBLAST search using the sequences of IREDs A, B, I,o r K as\ntemplate, ( ii) contained a full-length Rossmann-fold domain\nwith a complete GxGxxG consensus sequence, hence excluding\ntruncated sequences, and ( iii) featured an acidic residue (Asp,\nGlu or Tyr) in position 187 (IRED- B numbering). Since Grogan\nand co-workers suggested that the flanking of D187 in Q1EQE0\nby two apolar residues (L137 and L191) might be instrumental\nin raising the p K\na value of the D187 side chain, resulting in it\nbeing protonated under physiological conditions, we also made\nthe presence of such apolar flanking residues a selection\nrequirement when the ‘proton donor’ residue was Asp or Glu.\nThe 215 hits identified using these search criteria were\nnarrowed down to 182 by removal of duplicates (identical\ndatabase entries found by more than one of the four BLAST\nsearches) and of redundant sequences (database entries having\na different accession code but identical sequence). These 182\ncandidates were aligned using the Clustal Omega online tool\nand arranged into a phylogenetic tree by the neighbour-joining\nmethod.\nThe phylogenetic tree (Figure 1) shows a clear separation\ninto two major branches: the ‘D-type’ branch with a higher\noverall homology to confirmed IREDs A and B, featuring an\naspartic acid (or, in two cases a glutamic acid) residue in\nposition 187 (IRED- B numbering), and the ‘Y-type’ branch with a\nhigher overall homology to IREDs I and J and a tyrosine residue\nin the respective position. The D-type branch is the larger one\nof the two, accommodating 116 of the 182 candidate\nTable 1.

Scheller et al. have observed a\nsimilar division into two superfamilies of different size in a\nsequence similarity network analysis of the first version of the\nImine Reductase Engineering Database.[9aa] Figure 1 also shows\nthat the sequence space of both major branches of our\nphylogenetic tree has been explored only in small parts and\nwith an unbalanced distribution of the characterised enzymes.\nWe randomly selected 15 novel enzyme candidates [12] from\nall main sub-branches of the phylogenetic tree for expression\nand experimental characterisation, along with the four known\nIREDs A, B, I, and K. The genes encoding these 19 proteins were\nordered as linear, synthetic DNA double-strands, subcloned into\npET28a(+) and expressed heterologously in E. coli BL21 (DE3),\nusing terrific broth (TB) as growth medium and IPTG (1 mM) for\ninduction. Under these conditions, four enzymes (B5GWP9,\nF6EHI0, I0KVG9, I0W7U4) were expressed only in insoluble form,\nwhile for the gene encoding G4HA73 several attempts of\nsubcloning failed and an expression construct was hence never\nobtained. These five candidates were therefore excluded from\nall further investigations. The 14 enzymes expressed in soluble\nform (listed in Table 1) were tested for IRED activity using wet\nwhole cells as biocatalyst and 2-methylpyrroline ( 1a , 50 mM;\nFigure 2) as substrate. These experiments confirmed that all ten\nnovel IRED candidates are indeed functional imine reductases.\nConservation analyses of the Imine Reductase Engineering\nDatabase have revealed the conservation of Asp187 (IRED- B\nnumbering) in IREDs that reduce 1a to the ( R)-amine, and of a\ntyrosine residue in the corresponding position of the ( S)-\nselective enzymes,\n[9aa] suggesting that the residue in this\nposition might be used as a predictor of IRED stereoselectivity.\nMore recent studies have shown, however, that functional\nIREDs of either selectivity can feature other amino acid residues,\nincluding those with non-acidic side-chains, in the ‘proton\ndonor’ position,\n[9l,s,x,y] which demonstrates that the factors\ngoverning IRED selectivity are more complex than initially\nassumed. Chiral-phase GC analysis of the biotransformations of\nsubstrate 1a by the 14 IREDs investigated in this study showed\nthat with one exception all enzymes exhibit the expected\nstereoselectivity ( R for D-type, S for Y-type). Only IRED- G\n(L8EIW6) breaks this pattern: it is a D-type IRED but forms ( S)-2-\nmethylpyrrolidine from 1a in >99 % ee. The same ‘inverse’\nstereoselectivity is also observed with several other substrates\n(see Figure 3 below). This finding is interesting in the context of\na recent analysis by Fademrecht et al., who found that two\nactive-site residues consistently differ between ( R)- and ( S)-\nselective IREDs: Previously described ( S)-selective enzymes\ninvariably have a proline in position 139 and a phenylalanine in\nposition 194 (IRED- B numbering for both positions), while ( R)-\nselective IREDs feature a hydrophobic residue (Val, Thr, Ile) in\nFigure 1.Phylogenetic tree of the putative imine reductases identified in this work.

[11] The\npartial sequence alignment in Table 1 shows that IRED- G\ncontains the proline and phenylalanine residues typical for ( S)-\nIREDs, indicating that these are better predictors for IRED\nstereoselectivity than overall sequence homology or the nature\nof the ‘proton donor’ residue.\nEnzyme Characterisation\nAfter confirming the imine reductase activity of the novel IREDs\nand determining their stereoselectivity in the reduction of 1a ,\nwe proceeded with a thorough characterisation of the enzymes\nwith respect to their pH-activity profile, their temperature\nstability, their cofactor preference, and their activity and stereo-\nselectivity towards a broader range of substrates. The known\nIREDs A, B, I, and K were included in these experiments for\ncomparison.\nAnalysis of the pH-activity profiles revealed two groups of\nenzymes, one showing highest activity at pH 7.0–7.5 (IREDs A–\nE, I–M), the other preferring slightly acidic pH values (pH 6.0;\nIREDs F–H, N). The temperature stability varied widely: Some\nenzymes (e. g., IREDs A, M) retained significant activity even\nafter incubation at 50 8C for 1 h, while others (e. g., IRED- B) were\ncompletely inactivated even by a 1 h incubation at 37 8C. The\npreferred cofactor for all investigated enzymes is NADPH, but\nNADH was also accepted by some of the enzymes at\nappreciable rates. For instance, IRED- H showed 25 % of its\nmaximum activity when NADH was used as cofactor instead of\nNADPH. Detailed data on pH optimum, thermostability, and\ncofactor preference are provided in the Supporting Information\n(Supporting Figures S1–S5).\nThe specific activities of the IREDs towards substrates 1a –g\nwere determined by spectrophotometrically following the\nconsumption of NADPH in biotransformations using enzymes\npurified by Ni\n2+-NTA affinity chromatography. Table 2 summa-\nrises the obtained results. Although activity was detectable for\nall but two substrate–enzyme combinations, the observed\nvalues vary over a wide range: The specific activities of different\nIREDs towards the same substrate span up to three orders of\nmagnitude (e. g., substrate 1d ) and the activity of the same\nenzyme towards the seven imines tested can range from as low\nas 1.4 mU/mg to >2700 mU/mg (IRED- F, substrates 1a and 1e).\n3,4-Dihydroisoquinoline ( 1e) turned out to be a particularly\nwell-accepted substrate, being reduced at initial rates of\n>500 mU/mg by 10 out of the 14 IREDs.\nTo obtain information on the stereoselectivity of the\ninvestigated IREDs and on their activity towards substrates 1h –\nk, which are not amenable to photometric activity screening,\nwe next performed biotransformations of all ten imines 1a –k\n(10 mM) employing lyophilised crude cell-free extracts of IREDs\nA–N. For in situ regeneration of the NADPH cofactor, we chose\nthe well-known alcohol dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus\nbrevis (Lb-ADH), employing isopropanol (5 % v/v) as cheap and\ninnocuous sacrificial co-substrate. This approach, which repre-\nsents a biocatalytic alcohol-to-imine hydrogen transfer, is\nenabled by the excellent chemoselectivity of the involved\nenzymes: Alcohol dehydrogenases are unable to reduce imines,\nwhile imine reductases are generally unreactive towards\ncarbonyl compounds.\n[13] As shown in Figure 3, high conversions\nand excellent optical purities were attained in many of the\nreactions and the observed stereoselectivities largely follow the\nexpected patterns, with the previously discussed exception of\nthe ( S)-selective D-type IRED- G. Among the general trends that\nemerge from the data are the poor acceptance of sterically\nFigure 2.Imines 1 and corresponding amines 2 investigated in the present study.\n3239ChemCatChem 2018, 10, 3236 – 3246 www.chemcatchem.org /C23 2018 The Authors.

[14] Gratify-\ningly, many of the reactions conducted at elevated substrate\nloading proceeded smoothly to high conversions, whereby the\nhighest productivities were often observed at 100–200 mM\nconcentration of the imine (for an exemplary data set, see\nFigure 4; for complete data, see Supplementary Figures S6–S9\nin the Supporting Information). These results are not surprising\nin the light of previous Michaelis /C0 Menten kinetic studies on\nIREDs, which found KM values of typical imine substrates to be\nin the millimolar range. [9t,v,ab–ad,ah] These enzymes therefore reach\nmaximum activity only in the presence of high-millimolar\nconcentrations of imines. In some cases, however, elevated\nsubstrate concentrations were not well tolerated. For instance,\nthe conversion of indoleine 1i by IREDs C, G, and I dropped\nfrom >90 % to below 5 % upon raising the substrate concen-\ntration from 10 mM to 50 mM (Figure 4, B; Supplementary\nFigure S9 in the Supporting Information).\nOut of the biotransformations that worked well at 100 mM\nsubstrate concentration, two were chosen for reactions at\npreparative scale (5 mmol): Imine 1b was reduced by IRED- J to\n(S)-2-methylpiperidine ( 2b), which was isolated as the corre-\nsponding acetamide derivative in 74 % yield and >99 % ee. The\nreduction of 1-methyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline ( 1g ) by IRED- D\nafforded ( R)-2g in 98 % ee and 91 % isolated yield.\nCo-expression of IREDs andLb-ADH\nAlthough the biotransformations using lyophilised cell-free\nextracts of IREDs and Lb-ADH gave excellent results, we\nanticipated that a whole-cell biocatalyst would be even better\napplicable to preparative-scale reactions. In particular, co-\nexpression of IREDs and Lb-ADH in a single host would provide\na convenient ‘all-in-one’ biocatalyst that could benefit from\nintracellular cofactor cycling, rendering the external addition of\nNADP\n+ unnecessary. Because the plasmids used for expression\nof the imine reductases and of Lb-ADH are complementary with\nrespect to both antibiotic resistance and induction conditions,\nimplementation of a two-plasmid co-expression system was\nstraightforward (Figure 5).\nThe ‘designer cells’ co-expressing Lb-ADH and IREDs worked\nwell in the absence of additional NADP +, even after prolonged\nstorage of the lyophilised preparations at 4 8C (data not shown).\nBiotransformations carried out with 20 mg/mL of lyophilised\ncells gave results comparable to those obtained with 2 mg/mL\nof lyophilised cell-free extract, and elevated substrate concen-\ntrations were also tolerated similarly well (see Figure 6 for three\nexamples; for complete data see Supplementary Figures S10–\nFigure 4.Conversions (bars) and productivities (circles) achieved in the\nreduction of (A) imine 1g using IRED- J, and (B) imine 1i using IRED- C.

No significant differences\nwere observed in the enantioselectivities of the reductions\ncatalysed by the ‘designer cells’ compared to those catalysed\nby the cell-free enzyme preparations.\nThe preparative applicability of the IRED/ Lb-ADH ‘designer\ncells’ was demonstrated by two reductions at gram scale\n(10 mmol substrate at 100 mM concentration): The biotransfor-\nmation of imine 1c by cells co-expressing Lb-ADH and IRED- D\nafforded, after in situ derivatisation with acetic anhydride, the\nacetamide derivative of amine ( R)-2c in 65 % isolated yield\n(1.01 g) and >99 % ee. Using an Lb-ADH/IRED-J ‘designer cell’,\n(S)-1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline ( 2g ) was obtained\nfrom the corresponding imine 1g in 94 % yield (1.38 g) and in\noptically pure form ( ee >99 %).\nConclusions\nTo summarise, we report the expression and characterisation of\neight novel imine reductases along with six literature-known\nenzymes, thereby contributing to the further expansion of the\ngrowing IRED enzyme ‘toolbox’. Basic characterisation of the\nnew enzymes revealed two distinct groups with respect to the\npH optimum and wide variations in temperature stability. The\nspecific activities of the IREDs towards the investigated imines\n1a –g ranged from <1 mU/mg to >5 U/mg. In terms of\nsubstrate scope, group-specific trends were observed for the\n‘D-type’ and ‘Y-type’ branches of the phylogenetic tree, as the\nD-type enzymes gave particularly poor results with sterically\ndemanding imines. The stereoselectivity of the enzymes, on the\nother hand, was most reliably predicted not by their affiliation\nto either of the two phylogenetic branches but rather by the\npresence of key residues identified in a recent bioinformatics\nanalysis by Pleiss and co-workers.\n[11]\nCofactor regeneration via formal alcohol-to-imine hydrogen\ntransfer employing alcohol dehydrogenase from Lactobacillus\nbrevis as auxiliary enzyme was successfully implemented and\nallowed the imine reductions to proceed efficiently at elevated\nsubstrate concentrations (100 mM) and on preparative scale. A\nfurther simplification of the reaction system was achieved by\nusing an IRED/ADH ‘designer cell’ as biocatalyst, which showed\nsatisfactory imine-reducing activity also in the absence of\nadditional NADP +. Studies aimed at applying the IREDs\ndescribed herein to the preparation of more complex amines\nare currently underway in our laboratory, and their results will\nbe reported in due course.\nExperimental\nGeneral Methods and Materials\n1H- and 13C-NMR spectra were recorded using a 300 MHz instru-\nment. Chemical shifts are given in parts per million (ppm) relative\nto TMS ( d=0 ppm) and coupling constants ( J) are reported in Hertz\n(Hz).

Diethyl ether and acetonitrile\nused for anhydrous reactions were dried over molecular sieves\n(3 A˚) for at least 48 hours. THF used for anhydrous reactions was\ndistilled from potassium/benzophenone directly before use. For\nanhydrous reactions, flasks were oven-dried and flushed with dry\nargon just before use.

These sequences were manually\nchecked for the presence of the following features: (1) a full-length\nRossmann-fold domain with a complete GxGxxG consensus\nsequence, (2) a polar residue (Ser, Thr) in position 111 (IRED- B\nnumbering), (3) an acidic residue (Asp, Glu) in position 187 (IRED- B\nnumbering), along with apolar residues (Ala, Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, Val)\nin positions 137 and 191 (IRED- B numbering), or a Tyr residue in\nposition 187 (IRED- B numbering). Of the 1065 candidate sequences,\n215 contained all three features. These were further narrowed\ndown to 182 by removal of duplicates (identical database entries\nfound by more than one of the four BLAST searches) and of\nredundant sequences (database entries having a different accession\ncode but identical sequence). A multiple-sequence alignment of\nthe 182 candidate proteins was generated using the Clustal Omega\nonline tool (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/)\n[16] and ar-\nranged into a phylogenetic tree by the neighbour-joining method,\nalso using the Clustal Omega interface.

{"text": "Biosynthesis of plant tetrahydroisoquinoline\nalkaloids through an imine reductase route†\nLu Yang,ab Jinmei Zhu,b Chenghai Sun,b Zixin Denga and Xudong Qu *ab\nHerein, we report a biocatalytic approach to synthesize plant tetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids (THIQAs)\nfrom dihydroisoquinoline (DHIQ) precursors using imine reductases andN-methyltransferase (NMT). The\nimine reductase IR45 was engineered to signiﬁcantly expand its substrate speciﬁcity, enabling eﬃcient\nand stereoselective conversion of 1-phenyl and 1-benzyl 6,7-dimethoxy-DHIQs into the corresponding\n(S)-tetrahydroisoquinolines (S-THIQs). Coclaurine N-methyltransferase (CNMT) was able to further\neﬃciently convert these ( S)-THIQ intermediates into ( S)-THIQAs. By assembling IRED, CNMT, and\nglucose dehydrogenase (GDH) in one reaction, we eﬀectively constituted two artiﬁcial biosynthetic\npathways in Escherichia coli and successfully applied them to the production ofﬁve (S)-THIQAs. This\nhighly eﬃcient (100% yield from DHIQs) and easily tailorable (adding other genes) biosynthetic approach\nwill be useful for producing a variety of plant THIQAs.\nIntroduction\nTetrahydroisoquinoline alkaloids (THIQAs) are a class of\nimportant bioactive natural products.1 Molecules in this family\ntypically contain benzyl (benzylisoquinoline alkaloids, BIAs) or\nphenyl (phenylisoquinoline alkaloids, PIAs) groups at the C-1\nposition and show a remarkable spectrum of biological activity\n(Scheme 1).\n1,2 Currently, more than a dozen of naturally occur-\nring or semisynthetic THIQAs have been used in the clinic for\ntreating a diverse range of diseases.\n1–3 As most THIQAs are\nproduced by plants, signicant eﬀorts have been devoted in the\npast few decades to develop synthetic approaches for their\npreparation.\n1 However, the unsatisfactory enantioselectivity and\nhigh cost of asymmetric catalysis make chemical approaches\nstill commercially unfeasible.1\nIn natural products, THIQ sca ﬀolds are biosynthesized\nthrough a Pictet–Spengler reaction.4 The major enzymes which\ncatalyze these reactions are norcoclaurine synthases (NCSs).\nNCSs condense dopamine with 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (4-\nHPAA) or 3,4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (3,4-HPAA) to give rise\nto (S)-norcoclaurine or (S)-norlaudanosoline.\n5 Following decora-\ntions by methyltransferases (MTs) or P450s, 4-HPAA and 3,4-\nHPAA can be converted into (S)-reticuline (Scheme 2), a key\nintermediate of/C242500 BIAs.5 With the growing understanding of\nBIA biosynthesis, reconstruction of plant biosynthetic pathways\nin microbial hosts has become a feasible strategy for producing\nBIAs. By incorporation of partial or complete biosynthetic path-\nways in microbial hosts, a number of BIAs (i.e. opiates, sangui-\nnarine and noscapine) have been successfully synthesized from\nsimple precursors or glucose.\n6 Such biosynthetic approaches can\nbecome more economical and easy-to-operate than chemical\nsynthesis, making biosynthesis a highly attractive alternative.\nAlthough great success has been achieved, there still remain\nmany challenges for microbial production of plant THIQAs:\n7 (i)\nthe biosynthesis of PIAs and many BIAs remain elusive, and\nScheme 1 Representative THIQAs.\naState Key Laboratory of Microbial Metabolism, School of Life Sciences and\nBiotechnology, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200240, China.

(ii) Most valuable THIQAs are\nhighly modied, i.e. bearing methoxy groups at the C6, C7, C3\n0\nand C4 0 positions. (iii) Reconstitution of the biosynthetic\npathways in microbes requires the introduction of a large\nnumbers of genes, which brings a heavy metabolic burden on\nthe microbe. Moreover, many plant enzymes such as OMTs and\nP450s are poorly expressed or show low reactivity (NCSs) in\nmicrobial systems.\n6e,k,8 Therefore, production of plant THIQAs\nin microbes oen results in very low yields.3 To avoid these\nchallenges, appropriately substituted precursors can be fed into\nsimplied biosynthetic pathways. However, such an approach is\nrestricted either by the narrow substrate scope of NCSs, whose\nactivity is strictly dependent on the C\n6-hydroxyl and C8a-meth-\nylene groups (Scheme 2)9 or the stereochemistry at C1, which is\nchallenging to preparevia practical chemical synthesis.1\nRecently, our lab and another group identi ed imine\nreductases (IREDs) that are capable of reducing sterically\nhindered 1-phenyl dihydroisoquinolines (DHIQs) to yield the\ncorresponding chiral 1-phenyl-THIQs.\n10 In contrast to NCSs,\nIREDs have a distinct catalytic mechanism, which does not rely\non the C\n6-hydroxyl or C8a-methylene group, and therefore can\naccept highly modied DHIQ precursors. Moreover, IREDs from\nbacterial sources can be well overexpressed and show good\nactivity inEscherichia coli.Thus, by combining IREDs with other\nmodication enzymes, it is potentially feasible to produce\nTHIQAs through feeding DHIQ precursors. Herein, we demon-\nstrate this concept by using IREDs, N-methyltransferases\n(NMTs), and glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) to construct two\nminimal biosynthetic pathways. By incorporating these arti-\ncial pathways intoE. coli, we successfully synthesize a group of\npharmaceutically valuable PIAs and BIAs. Our results demon-\nstrate that this strategy is an eﬃcient approach to the biosyn-\nthesis of plant THIQAs.\nResults\nEngineering the substrate specicity of IR45 for the synthesis\nof 1-phenyl 6,7-dimethoxyl-THIQs\nCryptostyline I, II and III (1–3, Scheme 1) are three PIAs isolated\nfrom the plantCryptostylis fulva.11 They are used as pharmaco-\nlogical probes for understanding the pathophysiological roles\nof peptides in the nervous system.\n12 Unlike BIAs, the biosyn-\nthesis of PIAs is still poorly understood, and currently the\nbiosynthetic genes of1–3 are not known. Given their valuable\npharmaceutical utility and representative roles for the PIAs,\nthese three products were chosen as the targets for this study.\nThree 1-phenyl-6,7-dimethoxy-DHIQ precursors ( 1a–3a,\nScheme 3) corresponding to cryptostyline I–III (1–3) were ob-\ntained in good yields (90–91%) by chemical synthesis (see the\nESI†). In a previous study, we identied an S-selective IRED,\nIR45, which showed good tolerance toward 1-phenyl-DHIQs.\n10a\nTherefore, this enzyme was selected for activity assays with the\nnew substrates. Encouragingly, IR45 eﬀectively reduced 1a to\nthe ( S)-1-methylenedioxyphenyl-6,7-dimethoxy-THIQ ( 1b,\nScheme 2) with 100% conversion and >99% ee (Table 1),\nalthough it showed no activity toward the two bulkier substrates\n(2a and 3a). To gain a more detailed understanding of its\nsubstrate specicity, the structure of IR45 was modelled based\non the IRED Q1EQE0 (64% identity, PDB: 3ZHB).\n13 Docking of\n1a into the binding pocket of IR45 indicated that the substrate\nis closely surrounded by the conserved aspartic acid (D183) and\nNADPH (Fig. 1). The imine bond is positioned close to thesi-\nface of NADPH, consistent with the observedS-selectivity in the\nproduct. The methylenedioxyphenyl group points to the right\ncle, which consists of residues from two subunits of the\nenzyme (V81, S107, E253\n0 and H2570). On the other side of the\nactive site, the 6,7-dimethoxy aryl group is surrounded by two\nresidues, W191 and F190. These two bulky residues form the\nScheme 2 Approaches for plant THIQA biosynthesis.\nThis journal is © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020 Chem.

Engineering this area, however,\nmay signicantly impair the enzyme's activity and stability, as\nresidues in this region are crucial for inter-subunit interactions,\ni.e. H257\n0 forms a stabilizing salt bridge with R112. Thus, we\nenvisioned enlarging the binding pocket by engineering the\nside of the pocket comprising F190 and W191. By mutating\nthese sterically demanding residues, we thought that the\nsubstrate could be moved slightly deeper into the le cavity,\nthus potentially relieving the steric hindrance between the right\ncle and substrates2a and 3a.\nIn our previous studies, we found that W191 plays important\nroles in substrate binding and maintaining the enzyme's cata-\nlytically active conformation. Mutation of W191 to alanine or\nleucine reduces thek\ncat and Km for the substrate 1-phenyl-DHIQ\n(6a, Scheme 3).10a To identify optimal mutations, W191 was\nfurther mutated to the remaining 17 amino acids. These vari-\nants together with the W191A and W191L were assayed for the\nreduction of 2a and 3a. Although most mutants were inactive,\none mutant in particular, W191F, showed marginal but clear\nactivity toward these substrates (3% and 2% for 2a and 3a\nrespectively, Table 1 and Fig. S1A†). To unveil the detailed\neﬀects of these mutations on the IRED's activity, we used the\nmore active substrate6a for activity analysis. Similarly, W191F\nshows a clear improvement in the conversion of 1-phenyl-DHIQ\n(1.5-fold), while the others all drastically reduce or even abolish\nthe catalytic activity (Fig. S2†).\nKinetic analysis of the most active mutants, including\nW191F, W191C, W191M, W191H, W191N, and W191S as well as\npreviously obtained W191A and W191L revealed that theirk\ncat\nand Km values both have been reduced (Table S1 and Fig. S3A†).\nHowever, unlike the other enzymes whosekcat is signicantly\nreduced by one to two orders of magnitude, thekcat value of\nW191F is decreased by only 1.8-fold (Table S1†), suggesting that\nW191F has the least negative impact on the enzyme's catalytic\nScheme 3 DHIQ substrates prepared and used in this study.\nTable 1 Conversion and enantioselectivity of IR45 and its mutants\ntoward 1a–5a\nSubs.\nConversion (%) and enantiomeric excess (ee)a (%)\nIR45 W191F F190L –W191F F190M –W191F\n1a 100; >99S — 100; >99S 100; >99S\n2a 03 ; — 75; >99S 0\n3a 02 ; — 100; >99S 0\n4a 100; >99S — 100; >99S 100; >99S\n5a 100; >99S — 100; >99S 100; >99S\na First value shown represents conversion and the second value\nrepresents the ee value.

As W191 is highly conserved, we assume that this\nmutation should be benecial for many other IREDs.\nThe encouraging results with W191F inspired us to further\nengineer the enzyme by targeting the adjacent residue F190. We\nmutated all 19 other residues on top of W191F and then assayed\nthese double mutants for activity on the bulkier DHIQ\nsubstrates. To our grati cation, one mutant F190L –W191F\nshows drastically improved activity toward both2a and 3a (75%\nand 100% conversion within 24 hours respectively) with very\nhigh stereoselectivity for theS-products 2b and 3b (Scheme 2\nand Table 1). Kinetic analysis conrmed that both2a and 3a are\ngood substrates for F190L–W191F (k\ncat/Km values are 0.011 and\n0.087 s/C01 mM/C01, respectively, Table 2). The identicalKm values\n(0.307 mM for2a and 0.372 mM for3a) yet diﬀerent kcat values\n(0.003 s/C01 for 2a and 0.032 s/C01 for 3a) suggest that binding\nconformation accounts for the diﬀerence in their activity. This\nindicates that other residues inuencing the binding confor-\nmation in the cavity could be engineered to further improve the\nenzyme's catalytic activity.\nThrough protein engineering, we have successfully broad-\nened the substrate specicity and enabled IR45 to eﬀectively\nconvert very sterically hindered DHIQ precursors into their\ncorresponding THIQs. In addition, the successful expansion of\nthe substrate specicity of IR45 demonstrates that alteration of\nthe sites that do not directly repel the substrate is indeed an\neﬀective way to optimize an enzyme's substrate specicity. This\nstrategy will be useful for engineering other proteins, in which\ncertain substrate–protein interactions are critical for main-\ntaining catalytic activity or active conformation.\nEmploying IR45 mutants to synthesize 1-benzyl 6,7-\ndimethoxyl-THIQs\nBecause BIAs make up the remainder of the THIQA family, we\nwere interested in applying IR45 to their synthesis as well. (S)-\nLaudanosine (5, Scheme 1) is a pharmaceutically important BIA,\nnaturally found in opium in minute amounts (0.1%).\n14 Its\nsemisynthetic derivative atracurium is medically used for skel-\netal muscle relaxation during surgery and mechanical ventila-\ntion.\n3 By mild chemical oxidation, ( S)-laudanosine can be\nreadily converted into the antitussive drug ( S)-glaucine.15\nProduction of racemic (R,S)-laudanosine in E. coli has been\npreviously achieved through feeding (R,S)-norlaudanosoline to\na strain expressing O-MTs and NMTs. 16 However, the poor\nactivities of O-MTs result in low yields of (R,S)-laudanosine, and\nthe accumulation of many methylated intermediates (e.g. (R,S)-\nreticuline, (R,S)-codamine and (R,S)-laudanine) complicates its\nisolation (Fig. S4†). We chose to test our IRED approach in the\nsynthesis of 5 given its pharmaceutical value and (S)-1-benzyl-\n6,7-dimethoxyl-N-methyl-THIQ (BzTHIQ, 4 in Scheme 1) given\nits prototypical structure.\nTwo corresponding DHIQ substrates4a and 5a were chem-\nically synthesized (yields 95 and 93%) following a procedure\nsimilar to that used in the synthesis of1a–3a. As W191 and F190\nare critical for substrate binding, wild-type IR45 along with the\nlibrary of F190X–W191F (X denotes other 19 amino acids)\nvariants was tested for activity. To our gratication, wild-type\nIR45 eﬀectively converted4a and 5a into the corresponding (S)-\nTHIQ products (100% conversion and >99% ee). The best\nmutant F190M–W191F showed a further 6.8- and 1.8-fold\nimprovement in catalytic activity for4a and 5a, respectively (k\ncat/\nKm values for4a and 5a are 0.989 and 0.306 s/C01 mM/C01, Table 2).\nIt is intriguing that the wild-type IR45 can accept4a and 5a\nwhose planar frameworks are larger than those of the inactive\nsubstrates 2a and 3a. To explore how diﬀerences in binding in\nthe enzyme cavity may account for this disparity in activity, we\ndocked 4a into IR45 (Fig. 1B).In silicoanalysis revealed that the\nDHIQ plane of4a takes an identical conformation to that of1a.\nOn the other hand, the benzyl group of4a is bent toward the\nlarge cavity underneath the right cle unlike the 1-phenyl group\nof 1a which points directly towards the right cle. This diﬀer-\nence in positioning may result in less steric hindrance for the\notherwise ‘larger substrate’ 4a. This indicates that the rigid\nframeworks of 1-phenyl DHIQs are indeed the most challenging\nsubstrates for IREDs. Fortunately, our engineered mutant\nF190L–W191F is able to eﬀectively convert the very sterically\nhindered substrates 2a and 3a. In addition to the elevated\nactivity on 4a and 5a, F190M–W191F also shows a 2.23- and\n3.79-fold improvement (k\ncat/Km)o n 1a compared to wild-type\nIR45 and F190L –W191F, respectively (Table 2).

To improve expression, the\nCNMT gene was codon optimized for E. coli. As expected,\nfollowing optimization, CNMT was robustly expressed inE. coli.\nTo our gratication, CNMT eﬃciently converted allve of the\nS-THIQ substrates into their corresponding N-methylated\nproducts (100% conversion, Fig. S5A†). Kinetic analysis revealed\nthat CNMT showed similar activity to all 1-phenyl and 1-benzyl\nsubstrates except for the most active substrate4b (Table S2†). As\nthese substrates are much bulkier than previously known\nsubstrates of CNMT, we were interested in understanding how\nthey bind to the active site. Two representative substrates1b\nand 5b were individually docked into the crystal structure of\nCNMT (Fig. S6†).\n18 Similar to the conformation of4a in IR45,5b\nis bent, allowing it to be well accommodated in the binding\ncavity. The substrates are bound in an identical orientation with\ntheir methylenedioxy and methoxy groups in close proximity to\nresidues F322 and W329.\n18 Previous work showed that two\nmutants, F322A and W329A, had signicantly reduced catalytic\nactivity, with W329A having the most negative impact.18 In order\nto maintain these hydrophobic interactions while enlarging the\nbinding cavity, we mutated W329 into phenylalanine. However,\nlike W329A, W329F showed drastically reduced methylation\nactivity toward1–5 (Fig. S7A†), conrming that W329 is indeed\ncritical for maintaining the enzyme's activity.\nProduction of THIQAs from DHIQ precursors through the\nbiosynthetic pathway of IRED–NMT–GDH\nArmed with e ﬃcient imine reduction and N-methylation\nenzymes, we proceeded to combine these two steps into one\nbiocatalytic reaction. The puried F190L–W191F and F190M–\nW191F were coupled with CNMT and glucose dehydrogenase\n(GDH, for recycling NADPH from glucose) for the synthesis of2–\n3 and 1, 4–5 respectively. As expected, these enzyme cascades\ncan eﬃciently convert1a–5a into THIQAs with 100% conversion\n(within 24 h, Fig. S7B†). Moreover, we observed thatN-methyl-\nation improved the conversion of substrates2a and 3a into their\ncorresponding THIQAs. We hypothesize that the continuous\nremoval of THIQ intermediates by their irreversible methylation\ndrives the equilibrium of imine reduction from DHIQs to\nTHIQs.\nWith the encouraging results ofN-methylation, we turned to\nconstitution of the articial biosynthetic pathway inE. coli.T o\nachieve the highest transformation eﬃciency, each step was\nevaluated individually in theE. coli system. We rst evaluated\nthe eﬀect of temperature and IPTG concentration on the IRED\nreaction. E. coli stains containing F190M–W191F and GDH\n(cloned into pET28a and pACYCDuet, respectively) were incu-\nbated at 25, 30 or 37\n/C14C and supplemented with1a and diﬀerent\nconcentrations of IPTG when their OD600 reached 0.7. The\nbiotransformation results show that lower IPTG dosage (20mM)\nis better than a high IPTG dosage (Fig. S8A†) with conversion\nreaching only 70% and 40% with 50mM and 100 mM IPTG,\nrespectively, aer 3 days. We found that temperature also had\na signicant impact on the conversion. The biotransformation\neﬃciency at 30/C14C is 5 and 10 times higher than that at 25/C14C\nand 37 /C14C, respectively (aer 3 days) (Fig. S8B†). The optimal\nconditions for the IRED–GDH combination appear to be 20mM\nIPTG and 30/C14C. Next the conversion of the other four substrates\nwas evaluated under these optimized conditions (F190M –\nW191F was replaced by F190L–W191F for2a and 3a). Although\n4a and 5a can be eﬃciently converted into their reduced prod-\nucts (100%),1a–3a exhibit poor-to-medium conversion (6.5% to\n50%) (Fig. S1C †). These ratios are much lower than the\nconversion ratios of the in vitro enzymatic transformation,\nsuggesting that the 1-phenyl substrates1a–3a face diﬃculty in\npermeating the cell membrane.\nNext, theN-methyl transfer step was evaluated. Gratifyingly, all\nthe amine substrates,1b–5b, are completely converted into their\ncorrespondingnal products under the same optimal conditions\nas for IRED–GDH by E. coli containing CNMT (Fig. S5B†). As\nmethylation by CNMT appeared to improve the activity of imine\nreduction, we co-expressed all three enzymes in a single cell (NMT\nand GDH were cloned in pACYCDuet and IR45 in pET28a),\nforming a minimal biosynthetic pathway for the synthesis of\nTHIQAs. As expected1a, 4a and 5a (50 mg L\n/C01) can be completely\nconverted into their corresponding alkaloids within one to three\ndays (Table 3 and Fig. 2). By extraction with ethyl acetate, pure1, 4\nand 5 can be readily obtained in yields of 95%, 98% and 95%,\nrespectively. Conversion of2a and 3a also signicantly improved\n(89% and 51% respectively, Fig. S7C†), compared to the conver-\nsion by IRED–GDH (6.5% and 9.3%, Fig. S1C†).\nIn order to overcome the barrier of membrane per-\nmeabilization and further improve the conversion of2a and 3a,\nwe combined enzymatic and whole-cell biotransformation into\na single pot reaction. F190L–W191F and GDH wererst over-\nexpressed in a singleE. colistrain and then lysed by sonication.\nThe crude enzymes were directly added to theE. coli–CNMT\nculture when the OD\n600 reached 0.7. At this time, IPTG, DHIQ\nsubstrates and NADP (1.1& w/v) were added simultaneously to\ninitiate the CNMT expression and cascade biotransformation.\nTo our delight, both2a and 3a (50 mg L\n/C01) were completely\nconverted into their corresponding THIQAs (Table 3 and Fig. 2).\nThe isolated yields of2 and 3 are 93% and 96%, respectively.\nTherefore, by systematically improving enzyme activity and\noptimizing biocatalytic conditions, we successfully imple-\nmented the IRED-based route to biosynthesize two types of\nplant THIQAs.\nTable 3 Biosynthesis of 1–5 from precursors 1a–5a through the\nIRED-based pathways\nSubs.

Currently, the biosynthetic enzymes, including the\nkey Pictet –Spengler synthase, that assemble PIAs remain\nunknown. As such, reconstitution of PIA biosynthesis in\nmicrobes is yet to be realized. Although the biosynthesis of\nmany BIAs is well understood and elegant examples of their\nproduction in microbes have been reported, the poor perfor-\nmance of NCS O-MT and P450 enzymes results in overall low\nyields.\n3 Eﬀorts to bypass such bottleneck enzymes by employing\nmodied precursors are also limited by the narrow substrate\nscope of NCSs.9 IREDs, owing to their distinct catalytic mecha-\nnism, are not restricted by the same limitations as NCSs.\nTherefore, bottleneck enzymes such as O-MTs and P450\nhydroxylases can be omitted and replaced by readily available\nsynthetic DHIQ precursors. In conjunction with NMT and/or\nadditional other modi cation enzymes, this IRED-based\napproach has been shown to be very powerful in the biosyn-\nthesis of plant THIQAs.\nThe major obstacle for application of this approach is the\ngenerally poor tolerance of IREDs to bulky substituents at C1 of\nDHIQs. IR45 is a steric-hindrance tolerating IRED identied in\nour previous study.\n10a Due to their more rigid conformations, 1-\nphenyl 6,7-dimethoxyl-DHIQ substrates are more sterically\nhindered than the 1-benzyl 6,7-dimethoxyl-DHIQs, and wild-\ntype IR45 showed no activity on the most sterically hindered\nsubstrates 2a and 3a. To address this issue, we engineered IR45\nto signicantly expand its substrate scope. Instead of engi-\nneering the site of direct steric repulsion, we chose to alter the\nother side of the binding pocket. This strategy was very eﬀective\nfor IR45 and may prove to be useful for engineering other\nenzymes where certain protein interactions nearby the\nsubstrate are critical for maintaining catalytic activity or\nconformation.\nThe resultant mutant W191F–F190 eﬃciently and stereo-\nselectively (ee > 99%) converted the very sterically hindered\nsubstrates (2a and 3a) and the other three substrates (1a, 4a and\n5a) into THIQs. The other mutant F190M –W191F showed\nsignicantly improved activity toward1a, 4a and 5a. As these\nsubstrates are more sterically hindered than most other natural\nPIAs and BIAs,\n1,2 these IR45 mutants are potentially useful for\nthe synthesis of many other THIQAs. Practical application of\nthese enzymes can be backed up by the recently designed\nstrategy for scaling up IRED transformation.\n19 In addition to the\nIRED, we also found that the CNMT has a suﬃciently relaxed\nsubstrate specicity to accept very bulky THIQ substrates.\nTherefore, the broad substrate speci city of both the IR45\nmutants and CNMT has provided a solid basis for the applica-\ntion of this IRED-based biosynthetic strategy.\nAlthough most natural THIQAs containS-conguration at\nthe C1 position, it is still interesting to generateR-type THIQAs\nusing this strategy. However, our attempt to produceR-1b–5b\nusing the most broad-selective R-type imine reductase IR2 (ref.\n10a) was not successful. Like IR45, IR2 showsS-specicity to\nconvert 1a, 4a and 5a into the correspondingS-THIQs (2a and 3a\nare inactive, data not shown). The reverse stereo-speci city\nmight be due to the occurrence of the 6,7- and 3\n0,40-substituent\ngroups in the THIQ scaﬀold. Currently, protein engineering of\nIR2 is in progress to reverse its stereo-specicity.\nFinally, to accommodate the diﬀerent physical properties of\nPIAs and BIAs, we developed two types of biocatalytic\napproaches for their synthesis. BIAs can be biosynthesized\n(100% yield) from their DHIQ precursors using the recombinant\nE. colistrain expressing the articial biosynthetic pathway. Due\nto the poor membrane-permeability of their DHIQ precursors,\nPIAs 2 and 3 were not produced by a traditional whole-cell\nsystem in suﬃciently high yields. To overcome this challenge\nand avoid using the expensive S-adenosylmethionine (SAM)\ncofactor in theN-methylation step, we conceived a novel bio-\ncatalytic approach combining the enzymatic transformation of\nIRED–GDH and the whole-cell transformation of CNMT in one\npot. This chimeric system is as eﬃcient as the cell-based system\n(produces PIAs in 100% yield) and will be useful for biosyn-\nthesis of other products with similar problems.\nConclusions\nWe have developed an IRED-based strategy to successfully bio-\nsynthesize ve pharmaceutically valuable PIAs and BIAs.\nFig. 2 Production of THIQAs 1–5 in the IRED-based biosynthetic\nsystems.

Through protein engineering, we signicantly\nexpanded the substrate specicity of the IRED IR45. The two\nresultant mutants F190L–W191F and F190M–W191F can eﬃ-\nciently convert bulky 1-aryl-6,7-dimethoxy-DHIQ substrates into\n(S)-THIQs. These two IREDs, highly tolerant of steric hindrance,\nwill also be useful for the synthesis of many natural and\nsynthetic THIQs. TheN-methylation enzyme (CNMT) was also\nable to convert highly sterically hindered substrates. We also\ndeveloped an e ﬃcient and cost-e ﬀective enzyme/whole-cell\nchimeric biosynthetic system to overcome the barrier for\nbiotransformation of membrane-impermeable substrates. Our\nwork demonstrates that this IRED-based biosynthetic approach\nis eﬃcient (100% yield) andexible for the production of plant\nTHIQAs. By the addition of other modication enzymes, e.g.\nP450 enzymes, this minimal biosynthetic pathway can be\nfurther extended to the biosynthesis of other complex THIQAs.\nConﬂicts of interest\nThe authors declare no competingnancial interest.\nAcknowledgements\nThe authors are grateful to Prof. Wenbo Liu for the help in\nchiral analysis.

{"text": "Biocatalysis Hot Paper\nPowering Artificial Enzymatic Cascades with Electrical Energy\nAmmar Al-Shameri, Marie-Christine Petrich, Kai junge Puring, Ulf-Peter Apfel,\nBettina M. Nestl, and Lars Lauterbach*\nAbstract: We have developed a scalable platform that employs\nelectrolysis for an in vitro synthetic enzymatic cascade in\na continuous flow reactor. Both H\n2 and O2 were produced by\nelectrolysis and transferred through a gas-permeable mem-\nbrane into the flow system. The membrane enabled the\nseparation of the electrolyte from the biocatalysts in the flow\nsystem, where H\n2 and O2 served as electron mediators for the\nbiocatalysts. We demonstrate the production of methylated\nN-heterocycles from diamines with up to 99% product\nformation as well as excellent regioselective labeling with\nstable isotopes. Our platform can be applied for a broad panel\nof oxidoreductases to exploit electrical energy for the synthesis\nof fine chemicals.\nThe use of electrical energy to perform biological and\nchemical reactions has gained extensive interest in recent\nyears. Electro-driven reactions offer the advantages of being\nclean, easy to tune, and sustainable when coupled with\nrenewable energy sources. Biological electron transfer reac-\ntions are performed predominantly with cofactor-dependent\noxidoreductases. These represent a highly interesting and\nversatile class of biocatalysts for specific reduction, oxidation,\nand oxyfunctionalization reactions in organic synthesis.\n[1]\nElectrical energy has been applied in various biotechnological\napproaches to drive whole cells or immobilized enzymes on\nelectrodes towards cofactor recycling and production of\nbiofuels and fine chemicals.\n[2] In this context, electrochemical\nwater splitting delivers H 2 as an electron mediator required\nfor redox reactions with H 2 splitting enzymes. However,\nperforming electro-driven enzymatic cascades with isolated\nenzymes (in vitro) is still hampered by the high potentials\nrequired for water splitting, the low pH, and the high\ntemperature generated in the process. These crucial aspects\nwill eventually lead to denaturation of the metal-dependent\nenzymes, unspecific side reactions, and the formation of\nundesired reactive oxygen species (ROS).\n[2c]\nWe therefore set out to design a novel platform to perform\nan electro-driven in vitro enzymatic cascade. This one-pot\nenzymatic cascade exploits the redox power of H 2, which is\ngenerated by water splitting, in order to produce N-hetero-\ncycles in a flow system. By utilizing a gas-selective permeable\nmembrane,\n[3] we were able to decouple the electrochemical\nH2 generation from the enzyme transformations in one setup,\nthereby establishing an unhindered transfer of gases between\nthe two liquid phases. This ensured safe H\n2 handling by\navoiding the formation of explosive gas mixtures and\nrendered the biological system more stable. Furthermore,\nwe established an integrated platform to monitor the relevant\nparameters within the system on-line.\nThe bioelectrochemical system (Figure 1, top) was sub-\nsequently validated with a synthetic enzymatic cascade\nconsisting of an immobilized oxidase, reductase, and hydro-\ngenase to produce N-heterocycles from diamines in a contin-\nuous process. N-heterocycles belong to a highly important\nclass of compounds, and are found in various natural products,\nbiologically active structures, and medicinally relevant com-\npounds.\n[4] In previous work, we successfully showed that an\nNADPH-dependent imine reductase (IRED) can be com-\nbined with an oxygen-dependent diamine oxidase variant\n(PuO\nE203G) and an NADP +-reducing hydrogenase in a one-\npot process for the selective synthesis of N-heterocycles. [5]\nFor this study, we decided to couple an NADH-dependent\nIRED variant [6] from Myxococcus stipitatus with the O 2-\ntolerant, NAD +-reducing hydrogenase (SH) from Ralstonia\neutropha[7] using molecular H 2 as the reductant. We also\nexploited the versatility of this electro-driven approach for\n1) the synthesis of methylated N-heterocycles and 2) the\nisotopic labeling of N-heterocycles, which gave insight into\nthe reaction mechanism of IREDs. Electrolysis was per-\nformed using a pentlandite and Ni catalysts for the hydrogen\nevolution reaction (HER) and the oxygen evolution reaction\n(OER), respectively. Pentlandite is a Ni- and Fe-rich metal\nsulfide. It is a cheap and a sustainable alternative to platinum\nfor HER in operations performed under conditions poisonous\nto other catalysts.\n[8] The pentlandite/Ni system was bench-\nmarked against the more classical Pt system. Notably, both\nsystems were comparable in terms of efficiency with a variable\ndependency of H\n2 and O 2 evolution on the pH and voltage\n(Figure S1–S3 in the Supporting Information). In preliminary\nexperiments, we observed that pentlandite could produce\n[*] A. Al-Shameri, M.-C. Petrich, Dr. L. Lauterbach\nTechnical University of Berlin, Institute of Chemistry\nStrasse des 17.

Thus, the\nrequired amounts of O 2 could only be generated at high\nvoltages with Ni as OER. Moreover, the low solubility of the\ngases in the electrolyte negatively affected the transfer\nefficiency of the gases through the membrane. Thus, increas-\ning the gas concentrations in the electrolyte by applying high\nvoltages was crucial to enhance the transfer efficiency.\n[9]\nTherefore, we decided to perform the electrolysis at 2 V and\npH 2.0 for Pt/Pt and at 3.5 V and pH 1.3 for pentlandite/Ni.\nThe conversion of the model substrate 1,5-diamino-2-\nmethylpentane ( 1) into 3-methylpiperidine ( 2) was subse-\nquently investigated with in situ produced H 2 and O 2 in the\nenzymatic cascade. A mixture of purified enzymes was thus\ninjected into the circulating system to start the transformation\nof the test substrate 1. First results showed the successful\nformation of 2 with a production formation of 53% within\n16 hours (Figure S4) independent of the electrodes used. The\ngeneral applicability of the flow reactor was then tested for\nthe preparation of piperidine ( 6) and its derivatives using\nimmobilized enzymes in the cascade reaction. While SH and\ncatalase were immobilized on Amberlite FP54\nTM,[10] enzyme\ncarrier EziG TM from EnginZyme [11] was used for immobiliza-\ntion of PuO E203G and IRED NADH. The specific activities per\ncarrier ranged from 0.64 to 1 Umg /C01 (Table S1). The immo-\nbilized enzymes were packed in a column that was integrated\ninto the flow reactor. The evolution and consumption of O\n2/\nH2 and NADH, respectively, were monitored during the\ncascade using N-methylcadaverine ( 7) as the model com-\npound (Figure 2). The on-line monitoring enabled the record-\ning and tracking of each step of the catalysis by checking if the\nO\n2 and H2 concentrations were sufficient to start/proceed with\nthe reaction. The monitoring also gave a comprehensive\npicture of whether each enzyme was functioning correctly and\nFigure 1. Platform of the electro-driven in vitro enzymatic cascade for the synthesis of N-heterocycles from diamines in a flow reactor. Both H 2\nand O 2 are delivered by electrolysis using Pt/pentlandite as HER and Pt/Ni as the OER catalyst in an acidic electrolyte. A gas-permeable tube\ntransfers H 2 and O 2 from the electrolysis chamber (250 mL) into the flow system (16 mL). Sensors for H 2,O 2, and temperature and\na spectrophotometer (NADH) were integrated into the flow reactor to monitor on-line the evolution and consumption of H 2 and O 2 and NADH,\nrespectively. The enzymes of the cascade (left side) were immobilized and packed into a column within the flow system. Electro-driven cascades\nwere performed in deuterated Tris-HCl buffer (50 m m, pD 8.0) with 5 m m diamine substrate and 2 m m NAD\n+ cofactor in the flow reactor at 22 8C\nfor 16 h. O 2 and H 2 were generated by performing electrolysis for 5 hours using Pt/Pt electrodes at 2 V and pH 2.0. Product formation (in %) was\ndetermined by GC-FID. The regioselective labeling was confirmed by 1H NMR analysis (Figures S10–S18). The labeling yield was determined by\ncomparing the signals in LC-MS spectra (Figure S6–S9). a) Electrolysis with pentlandite/Ni electrodes at 3.5 V and pH 1.3. b) Substrate\nconcentration 8 m m.* x D indicates the incorporation of x deuterium atoms into the product.

It\nis worth mentioning that such a monitoring system (Figure 1)\nhad previously only been used in vivo during fermentations.\nNotably, we prepared various methylated N-heterocycles\nwith product formations of up to 99%. The results obtained in\nthe conversion of 1 and 3 were comparable to those from\nprevious work using native IRED and NADP\n+-reducing\nSH.[5] Interestingly, in this approach, 1,5-diaminopentane ( 5)\nwas poorly converted. The poor conversion might be\nexplained by the application of the IRED\nNADH variant. The\nKM,NADH value of this variant is ten times higher than the KM\nvalue of its wild type for NADPH. The kcat value of\nIREDNADH is 41% lower than that of wild-type IRED for\nthe reduction of the model substrate 2-methylpyrroline. [6] We\nhave also observed product inhibition on IRED NADH for 2 and\n6 (Figure S22). Herein, a scale-up of the reaction was easily\nmade possible by increasing the reaction volume (up to\n300 ml). We produced 69 mg of 8 and 55 mg of 2 in a 300 mL\nand 150 mL setup, respectively, using a threefold and twofold\nexcess of the immobilized enzymes (Table S2). Furthermore,\nwe produced 3 mg of N-methylpyrrolidine from linear\nN-methylputrescine (11% yield) by using the same set of\nimmobilized enzymes on a 150 mL scale.\nThe new setup was then used to test the reusability of the\nimmobilized enzymes. The same set of immobilized enzymes\ncould produce 6 from 5, with 26% of the maximum product\nformation retained after six cycles (Figure S5). The total\nturnover numbers were very high for all biocatalysts (Tables 1\nand S3), demonstrating the operational stability of our\nsystem.\nFinally, we studied the labeling of piperidines with stable\nisotopes such as deuterium in the electro-driven cascade. The\npreparation of organic compounds labeled with hydrogen\nisotopes is of essential importance in the chemical, biological,\nand environmental sciences. Hence, deuterated fine chem-\nicals are valued molecules for spectroscopic analysis, phar-\nmaceuticals, and analytical tracing.\n[12] Herein, we exploited\nthe unique characteristic of the SH to synthesize deuterated\nNAD(D). SH splits H\n2 at the hydrogenase module separately\nfrom the NAD + reduction at the diaphorase module. H 2-\ndriven labeling can be achieved using D 2O by providing two\nelectrons from H 2 splitting and D + from D 2O-generating\nNAD(D).[13] NAD(D) can then be utilized as a cofactor for\nvarious NADH-dependent reductases such as IRED to\nproduce deuterated compounds (Scheme 1).\nThe labeling was performed with D\n2O in the biotransfor-\nmation and H2O in the electrolysis units. We produced various\nlabeled piperidine derivatives from diamines with up to 99%\nof deuterium labeling. Only a small fraction of the products\nwas partially labeled (Figure 1). This inhomogeneity can be\nexplained by the presence of water traces in D\n2O (purity\n98%), protons released from H 2 splitting (ca. 1%), residual\nwater in the gases, remaining H 2O from immobilized\nenzymes, and the natural proton abundance of NAD +.W e\nexpected to observe labeling with a single D atom at the C6\ncarbon atom of the imine. Interestingly, we observed further\nlabeling with two D atoms at C5 (for the MS and NMR\nspectra, see Figures S6–S18). We hypothesize that the deut-\neration at C5 might have been caused either by a possible\nketo–enol tautomerization, followed by the oxidation of the\nsubstrate by PuOE\n203G, or an imine–enamine tautomerization\nwith subsequent spontaneous cyclization of the aminoalde-\nhyde intermediate. To examine this hypothesis, we conducted\nthe isotopic labeling using imines (2-methylpyrroline and 3,4-\ndihydroisoquinoline) and IRED\nNADH. Here, the labeling is\nfacilitated only by the activity of SH. Mass and NMR spectra\nrevealed a 85% labeling corresponding to the C6 carbon\natom of the imine (Figures S19–S21) without any labeling on\nfurther atoms. In addition, we used formate dehydrogenase\nFigure 2. On-line monitoring of H 2,O 2, and NADH during the electro-driven biotransformation. The concentrations of H 2 (A), O 2 (B), and NADH\n(C) were followed during the first hour of the transformation of 7 into 8 as an exemplary biotransformation. The electrolysis was performed for\n1 hour (yellow box) until both the H 2 and O 2 concentrations reached a plateau and stopped increasing. Then substrate and NAD + were added\n(black arrows). Purple arrows indicate the activity of each enzyme: the activity of putrescine oxidase (PuO E203G) is indicated by the consumption of\nO2 after adding the substrate (B); the activity of imine reductase (IRED NADH) is shown in the consumption of NADH (C); and the activity of\nsoluble hydrogenase (SH) is shown in the consumption of H 2 (A) and the evolution of NADH (C). The formation of H 2O2 was monitored over\ntime; no H 2O2 formation was detected. The experiment was performed as described in Figure 1.\nTable 1: Total turnover numbers (TTN nproduct/nenzyme) of each biocatalyst\nbased on the sum of products formed after the six cycles using the same\nset of immobilized enzymes.\nBiocatalyst SH IRED\nNADH PuOE203G Catalase\nTTN 1.1 /C148 10 6 1.6 /C148 104 1.2 /C148 104 1.6 /C148 108\nAngewandte\nChemieCommunications\n10931Angew.

No\nlabeling was observed when FDH was used. This finding\nindicates that the deuteration at C5 was merely caused by the\nketo–enol tautomerization (Scheme 1).\nWe determined that only about 4% of the electrical\nenergy was used for product formation (see Chapter S2.11 in\nthe Supporting Information). While this value seems very low,\nthis finding can be rationalized by the low solubility of the\ngases in water, reduction of O\n2 at the HER, heat production\nby overpotentials, inefficient gas transfer through the mem-\nbrane, and product inhibition of IRED NADH. Our system can\nbe further optimized by using suitable gas exchange mem-\nbranes, sophisticated electrodes, and further engineered\nbiocatalysts with improved features and broader substrate\nscopes.\nIn conclusion, we have designed a scalable platform to\npower enzymatic cascades with electricity. We furthermore\ndemonstrated the potential of the novel design by producing\nvarious piperidine derivates from diamines. We extended the\napplicability of the system towards performing regioselective\nisotopic labeling and provided useful insight into imine\nreduction by IREDs. This platform represents an important\nadvance in the field of biocatalytic synthesis, and it can be\nexpanded for powering various cofactor-dependent oxidor-\neductases.\nAcknowledgements\nA.A-S. and L.L. received funding from the German Research\nFoundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG, proj-\nect number 284111627) and the Einstein foundation.

Systematic evaluation of the structures and\nsubstrate-binding sites of the three enzyme families has\nrevealed four common principles for imine reduction: structur-\nally conserved cofactor-binding domains; tyrosine, aspartate, or\nglutamate as proton donor; at least four characteristic flanking\nresidues that adapt the donor’s pK\na\nand polarize the substrate;\nand a negative electrostatic potential in the substrate-binding\nsite to stabilize the transition state. As additional catalytically\nrelevant positions, we propose alternative proton donors in\nIREDs and βHADs as well as proton relays in IREDs, βHADs, and\nSDRs. The functional role of flanking residues was experimen-\ntally confirmed by alanine scanning of the imine-reducing SDR\nfrom Zephyranthes treatiae. Mutating the “gatekeeping” phenyl-\nalanine at standard position 200 resulted in a tenfold increase\nin imine-reducing activity.\nIntroduction\nChiral secondary amines are important building blocks for a\nbroad range of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and other\nspecialty chemicals. Two promising biocatalytic routes are the\nreductive amination of ketones by reductive aminases (RedAms)\nor by amine dehydrogenases, and the asymmetric reduction of\nimines catalyzed by imine reductases (IREDs).\n[1]\nPreviously, a\nmoderate sequence similarity and a high structural similarity\nbetween IREDs and β-hydroxy acid dehydrogenases (βHADs)\nwere uncovered.\n[2]\nIn both families, the monomers consist of an\nN-terminal NADPH-binding Rossmann-like domain\n[3]\n(domain\n3.40.50.720 in the CATH database)\n[4]\nand a C-terminal helical\ndomain. However, the active dimers are formed by domain\nswapping, with a long α8 helix in IREDs and a split α8 helix in\nβHADs.\n[5]\nAs a result, the substrate-binding sites in IREDs consist\nof amino acids from different monomers, whereas they are built\nby the two domains of a single monomer in βHADs.\n[2]\nThe two\nenzyme families also show an overlap of catalytic activities:\nIREDs from Streptosporangium roseumyy (R-IRED-Sr) and Paeni-\nbacillus elgii not only catalyze the asymmetric reduction of\nimines, but also of the activated keto substrate 2,2,2-\ntrifluoroacetophenone.\n[6]\nConversely, the glyoxylate reductase\nfrom Arabidopsis thaliana is known to catalyze the reduction of\ndifferent cyclic imine compounds.\n[7]\nThe similarity of the\ncatalytic sites of IREDs and βHADs is supported by the\nobservation that the exchange of a single amino acid in\nglyoxylate reductase from A. thaliana (sc-βHAD-At; K170D or\nK170F), γ-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase from Geobacter met-\nallireducens (sc-βHAD-Gm; K171D), and 6-phosphogluconate\ndehydrogenase from Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris strain\nMG1363 (lc-βHAD-Ll; K184D) resulted in a significant decrease\nin the keto acid reduction activity and a further increase in the\nimine reduction activity. This increase was less striking for the\nβHAD K171D from G. metallireducens.\n[7]\nShort-chain dehydro-\ngenases/reductases (SDRs) form a large protein family with high\nstructural and functional divergence.\n[8]\nThey consist of a\nconserved N-terminal NAD(P)H-binding Rossmann-like domain\nand a variable, substrate specificity determining C-terminal\nregion. Based on highly conserved sequence motifs, SDRs are\nclassified into six subfamilies (classical, extended, intermediate,\ndivergent, complex, and atypical SDRs).\n[9–15]\nIn addition to their\ncatalytic activity toward carbonyl groups, some SDRs also show\na moderate imine-reducing activity. Noroxomaritidine reductase\nfrom Narcissus pseudonarcissus (SDR-Np) catalyzes as a physio-\nlogical reaction the reduction of the enone moiety in the plant\nalkaloid noroxomaritidine, but also shows a promiscuous\ncatalytic activity toward the precursor imine norcraugsodine.\n[16]\nFurthermore, SDR-Np and a sequence-homologous SDR from\nZephyranthes treatiae (SDR-Zt) display catalytic activity toward\ndifferent imine compounds.\n[17]\nAdditionally, commercial glucose\ndehydrogenases are known to enantioselectively reduce bicyclic\niminium compounds.\n[18]\nDespite their promiscuous imine-reduc-\ning activity, these members of the SDR family have no\nsignificant global sequence similarity to IREDs.\n[19]\nAlthough the\n[a] P.

They differ in\ntheir catalytic machinery with a conserved aspartic acid or a\ntyrosine, respectively, as proton donor.\n[23]\nHowever, as the\norientation of the substrate depends critically on its structure,\nR- and S-selective imine reductases convert some imines into S\nand R amines, respectively.\n[20,24]\nTherefore, IREDs with aspartate\nor glutamate as donor were assigned as D-type, with tyrosine as\nY-type.\n[21]\nThe catalytic mechanism of βHADs is well understood.\nThe reduction of the C = O group is initiated via protonation by a\nconserved lysine as proton donor, followed by hydride transfer\nfrom NADPH.\n[25]\nTheir catalytic mechanism is similar to the\nextensively studied mechanism of classical SDRs, which is\nmediated by a conserved catalytic triad or tetrad Lys-Tyr-(Asn)-\nSer. The tyrosine serves as a proton donor, and its pK\na\nis\nadjusted by interaction with the catalytic lysine. A water\nmolecule can be bound between the catalytic lysine and the\noptional asparagine contributing to the proton relay system.\n[12]\nThe polarization of the substrate’s carbonyl group is mediated\nby the catalytic serine.\n[12]\nAll three enzyme families (βHADs,\nSDRs, IREDs) show conformational changes upon cofactor and\nsubstrate binding. For the IRED from Amycolatopsis orientalis (R-\nIRED-Ao), three different conformations have been observed:\nthe open apo form, the closed NADPH complex, and a complex\nwith cofactor and product. In the closed complex, the volume\nof the substrate-binding site considerably decreased.\n[24]\nA\ncomparable mechanism of induced fit has also been observed\nfor βHADs and SDRs.\n[16,26,27]\nAlthough sequence-based classifica-\ntions into distinct families provide a powerful tool, rigorous\nfunctional classification approaches could bias the selection of\nengineering templates. Despite of the separate family affiliation,\nwe hypothesized the existence of common principles for imine-\nreducing enzymes.\nResults\nDue to the difference in length of sc-βHAD-At and lc-βHAD-Ll,\nthe relative orientation of the Rossmann-like domains of lc-\nβHAD-Ll is twisted by 45 ° , and the dimerization is mediated by\ndifferent helical regions (Figure S4B, C in the Supporting\nInformation). In the dimeric SDR-Bv, in the absence of a C-\nterminal helical domain the contact is mediated by the two\nlong helices of the Rossmann-like domain of each monomer\n(Figure S4D). In the tetrameric SDR-Np, two of these dimers\nassociate along the axis of the β-sheets (Figure S5). The\nRossmann-like domains of R-IRED-Sr, R-IRED-Ao, βHAD-At,\nβHAD-Ll, SDR-Bv, and SDR-Np were superimposed (Figure S6),\nwhich revealed a similar binding conformation of NADPH\n(Figure S7) and a similar location of the NADPH-binding\nresidues in the structurally conserved Rossmann fold (β-strands\nβ1–β5 and α-helices αA–αE; Figure 1). IREDs and βHADs exhibit\na classical Rossmann fold consisting of six parallel β-strands\n(β1–β6) and an additional structural motif (β7-αF-β8) connect-\ning the Rossmann fold to a helical domain. β6 and β7 are\nconnected by a short α-helix, and β7 and β8 by the curved α-\nhelix αF; thus, the β-sheet of the Rossmann fold is extended by\nthe two antiparallel β-strands β7 and β8 (Figure 1A–C). Classical\nSDRs show a very similar N-terminal half of the Rossmann-like\ndomain, but the C-terminal half deviates (Figure 1D). In contrast\nto IREDs and βHADs, classical SDRs have additional short α-\nhelices after β5 and β6 and an additional seventh parallel β-\nstrand. Helices αD and αE are significantly longer than those in\nIREDs or βHADs, and helices αD and αF are kinked. Helix αF is a\nstructural analogue in the three families, contributing to the\nRossmann fold in SDRs and to the β7-αF-β8 motif in IREDs and\nβHADs. In comparison to the dimeric classical SDR-Bv, the\ntetrameric SDR-Np has additional N- and C-terminal helices (tN\nand tC) which contribute to the contact surface between the\ntwo dimers. Whereas the NADPH-binding site is structurally\nhighly conserved in the three enzyme families, the substrate-\nbinding sites differ. The substrate-binding sites in IREDs and in\nβHADs are formed by the connecting loops between β5 and αE\nand between β6 and β7, and by residues located on the N-\nterminal helical domain (Figure 1). The substrate-binding sites\nin classical SDRs, however, are formed by the short α-helices\nafter β5 and β6, and residues on the two long α-helices αE and\nαD. In the dimeric SDR-Bv, the loop after β5 is significantly\nshorter and does not display the helix observed in the imine-\nFigure 1.

Additionally, the electrostatics of\nthe substrate-binding sites differ: the investigated IREDs display\na negatively charged substrate-binding site, whereas the\ninvestigated βHADs and SDRs have a mainly positively charged\nsubstrate-binding site (Figure S9). However, SDR-Np and SDR-Zt\nexhibit a negatively charged residue (E212, classical SDR\nstandard position 210) on the flexible helix involved in substrate\nbinding. Furthermore, the mutation K184D in lc-βHAD-Ll leads\nto a negative charge around the catalytic site (Figure S10a). In\ncontrast, in the less active sc-βHAD-Gm K171D, the substrate-\nbinding site remains positively charged (Figure S10b). For a\ndetailed comparison of the substrate binding site residues,\nplease see the Supporting Information.\nWe hypothesize that all investigated catalytic sites consist of\na proton donor (aspartate, glutamate, or tyrosine) and at least\nthree flanking residues supporting the proton donation (Fig-\nure 2, Table S7). In addition to a nonpolar flanking residue\nwhich occurs in the considered IREDs, βHADs, and SDRs, one\ncharacteristic flanking methionine occurs in IREDs and βHADs.\nExcept for R-IRED-Sr, all enzymes display at least one putatively\ndonor-polarizing residue. A serine or threonine flanking the\nproton donor occurs in all considered IREDs (IRED standard\nposition 111; involved in cofactor binding),\n[2]\nβHADs, and SDRs\n(classical SDR standard position 144). In the case of keto-\nreducing SDRs, this catalytic serine has been proposed to\npolarize the carbonyl moiety.\n[11,12]\nTherefore, we hypothesize\nthat these residues also polarize the imine moiety in the course\nof imine reduction, supplemented by optional proton-media-\nting amino acids presumably forming a proton relay, as already\nproposed for βHADs\n[7]\nand SDRs.\n[11,12]\nThe exact composition\nand arrangement of these residues in the putative catalytic sites\nvaries between the enzyme families and even among the family\nmembers. Additionally, we hypothesize the existence of alter-\nnative catalytic sites in IREDs and βHADs. Thereby, single\nresidues can flank the conventional and the alternative proton\ndonors simultaneously.\nIn R-IRED-Sr, amino acid D170 (IRED standard position 187)\nis the proton donor and is flanked by the imine-polarizing S94,\nthe nonpolar M120 and L174, and the proton-mediating H244\n(IRED standard positions 111, 137, 191, 261). Interestingly,\namino acid W178 (IRED standard position 195) is flanked by the\nimine-polarizing T241 (IRED standard position 258), the non-\npolar M177 (IRED standard position 194) and L181 (IRED\nstandard position 198), and the proton-mediating H238 (IRED\nstandard position 255; Figures 2B and S11B). In R-IRED-Ao,\namino acid N171 (IRED standard position 187) at the conven-\ntional proton donor position is flanked by nonpolar M122 and\nL175 (IRED standard positions 137, 191). Compared to imine-\npolarizing S94 and proton-mediating H244 in R-IRED-Sr,\nresidues S96 and H247 (IRED standard positions 111, 261) are\nnot oriented toward the conventional proton donor position.\nOn the basis of the published product complex,\n[24]\namino acid\nY179 (IRED standard position 195) is suggested as the\nalternative proton donor (Figure S11A) flanked by the imine-\npolarizing T244 (IRED standard position 258), the nonpolar\nM240 (IRED standard position 254) and L245 (IRED standard\nposition 259), the donor-polarizing N241 (IRED standard posi-\ntion 255), and the proton-mediating H247 (IRED standard\nposition 261; Figures 2B and S11C). In the S-selective IRED from\nBacillus cereus (S-IRED-Bc), amino acid Y187 (IRED standard\nposition 187) is the conventional proton donor and is flanked\nby the imine-polarizing S112 (IRED standard position 111), the\nnonpolar M184 and M191 (IRED standard positions 184, 191),\nthe donor-polarizing Q188 (IRED standard position 188), and\nthe proton-mediating H261 (IRED standard position 261).

The lack of a complexed crystal structure gives rise to\nuncertainties. In lc-βHAD-Ll, amino acid K184 is the conven-\ntional proton donor and is flanked by the imine-polarizing S128,\nthe nonpolar M141, the proton-mediating H181 and H187, and\nthe donor-polarizing N102 and N188. In the lc-βHAD-Ll variant\nwith improved imine-reducing activity, K184 is replaced by\nD184. The amino acid E191 is proposed as the alternative\nproton donor and is flanked by the imine-polarizing S128, the\nnonpolar M195 and I367, the proton-mediating H187 and C366,\nand the donor-polarizing N188 (Figures 2C and S12C). In sc-\nβHAD-At, amino acid K170 is the conventional proton donor\nthat is flanked by the imine-polarizing T95, the nonpolar M169,\nand the donor-polarizing N174. In the sc-βHAD-At variant with\nimproved imine-reducing activity, K170 is replaced by D170.\nThe amino acid D239 is proposed as the alternative proton\ndonor and is flanked by the imine-polarizing T95, the nonpolar\nM177 and F231, the proton-mediating H235, and the donor-\npolarizing N174 and Q236 (Figures 2C and S12D). In sc-βHAD-\nGm, amino acid K171 is the conventional proton donor and is\nflanked by the imine-polarizing T96, the nonpolar M170, and\nthe donor-polarizing N175. In the sc-βHAD-Gm variant with\nslightly improved imine-reducing activity, K171 is replaced by\nD171. The amino acid D240 is proposed as the alternative\nproton donor and is flanked by the imine-polarizing T96, the\nnonpolar M178, F232 and M237, the proton-mediating H236,\nand the donor-polarizing N175, and K239 (Figures 2C and S12E).\nIn SDR-Np and SDR-Zt, Y161 (classical SDR standard position\n159) is the conventional proton donor and is flanked by the\nimine-polarizing S148 (classical SDR standard position 144), the\nnonpolar Y100 (classical SDR standard position 96), the proton-\nmediating C150 and H158 (classical SDR standard positions 146,\n156), and the conventional donor-polarizing K165 (classical SDR\nstandard position 163; Figures 2D and S13). No flanking\nmethionine was found in the imine-reducing SDRs.\nTo evaluate the functional relevance of residues in the\nsubstrate-binding site for imine reduction, alanine variants of\nselected residues of SDR-Zt were generated. In addition to the\nconventional catalytic residues for keto reduction, S148, Y161,\nand K165 (classical SDR standard positions S144, Y159, K163),\nsubstrate-binding residues with rare occurrence (< 4 %), Y100,\nN102, C149, C150, H158, F202, and E212 (classical SDR standard\npositions 96, 98, 145, 146, 156, 200, 210), were mutated\n(Figure S14). Using 1 and 10 mM 2,3,3-trimethylindolenine (TMI)\nas model imine substrate, respectively, specific activity and\nconversion after 3 hours were determined (Table S8, Figure 3).\nThe alanine variants of the conventional catalytic amino acids\nand of two proposed flanking residues (Y100, C150) nearly lost\ntheir activity toward TMI. For variants C150A and Y161A, the\nsubstrate conversion was low (in both cases < 1 %) and there-\nfore consistent with the respective specific activity. However, a\ndiscrepancy was noticed for Y100A, S148A, and K165A, for\nwhich conversions of 39 %, 17 %, and 17 % were found,\nrespectively, whereas poor specific activities (2 � 1 mU/mg, 2 �\n0.1 mU/mg, and 0 mU/mg) were detected. This deviation could\nbe caused by different KM values or substrate inhibition of the\nvariants, as the two screening methods required different\nsubstrate concentrations. While SDR-Zt variants Y100A and\nK165A converted TMI with high enantioselectivity (> 98 % ee of\nR product), variant S148A displayed a loss in enantioselectivity\n(17 % ee of R product). The alanine variant of the flanking\nhistidine (H158A) exhibited a decreased activity (32 % conver-\nsion, 21 � 1 mU/mg specific activity), similar to C149A (34 %\nconversion, 19 � 1 mU/mg specific activity) and E212A (37 %\nconversion, 14 � 4 mU/mg).\nWhile variant N102A showed a slightly increased specific\nactivity of 38 � 2 mU/mg, the conversion (39 %) was roughly\nsimilar to that of the wild-type SDR-Zt (42 % conversion, 30 �\n1 mU/mg). Interestingly, the F202A mutation resulted in a 10-\nfold increase in activity (311 � 2 mU/mg) compared to the wild\ntype, whereby > 99 % of TMI was converted. To explore whether\nC150 serves as a flanking residue which is essential for imine-\nreducing activity, the variants C150S and C150D were exper-\nimentally investigated (Table S8, Figure 3). The exchange\nagainst the less acidic serine (variant C150S) resulted in a\nsignificantly decreased activity (14 % conversion, undetectable\nspecific activity) compared to wild-type SDR-Zt, whereas the\nexchange against the acidic aspartate (variant C150D) led to a\ncomparable specific activity (23 � 2 mU/mg) and 49 % conver-\nsion of TMI.\nDiscussion\nFor the access to chiral amines, nature has evolved different\nprotein scaffolds into a broad range of biocatalysts with\ndifferent substrate specificities and high enantioselectivities of\nup to > 99 %.\n[21,23,24]\nIREDs and βHADs are evolutionary related,\nwhich is reflected in their similar structure and sequence.\n[2,21]\nSDRs display a different structure and no sequence similarity to\nFigure 3.

Guided by the enzyme mechanism of\nC = O reduction and the systematic evaluation of sequences and\nstructures of IREDs, βHADs, and imine-reducing SDRs, 12\nexperimentally characterized and three published variants,\n[7]\nwe\nhave identified four common principles enabling imine-reduc-\ning activity in NAD(P)H-dependent enzymes: 1) a suitable\ncofactor-binding domain, 2) proton donors adjusted in their\npK\na\n, 3) flanking residues which contribute to pK\na\nadjustment,\nand 4) a negative electrostatic potential in the substrate-\nbinding site.\nIn the investigated enzyme families, the cofactor-binding\nsite is provided by the ubiquitous Rossmann-like domain, which\nenables a productive orientation of the cofactor to allow\neffective hydride donation. Sequence motifs for the binding of\nthese cofactors need to be present.\n[28,29]\nAdditionally, residues\nthat are involved in cofactor binding can influence the ratio\nbetween oxidative and reductive activity,\n[30]\nor contribute to\nlocal secondary structures and conformational changes.\n[31]\nAlthough all investigated enzymes utilize NADPH as cofactor,\nother hydride donors are conceivable, such as NADH which\nserves as a cofactor for IREDs.\n[32,33]\nNext to aspartates, glutamates and tyrosines as proton\ndonor, it cannot be excluded that protonation occurs with other\nresidues (e. g., histidines). A pK\na\nadjustment of the respective\ndonor is required to enable proton transfer under experimental\nconditions (pH 6–8).\n[7,17,21,24]\nNonpolar flanking residues or\nnegatively charged residues in the neighborhood result in an\nincreased pK\na\nof the proton donor, whereas polar flanking\nresidues result in a decreased pK\na\n.\nIn D-type IREDs, the pK\na\nadjustment is enabled by two\nnonpolar flanking residues. Grogan and co-workers proposed\nthat two nonpolar flanking residues in R-IRED-Sk enable the\nstrongly acidic proton donor to mediate proton donation.\n[5]\nThis\nis supported by the pK\na\nof 7.7 of proton donor D170 at the\nhighly conserved conventional donor position (IRED standard\nposition 187; 93 % D in R-IREDs). Remarkably, the nonpolar\nflanking residues M120 (IRED standard position 137) and L174\n(IRED standard position 191) are highly conserved (94 % M and\n96 % L, respectively) in R-IREDs. Apart from H244 (IRED standard\nposition 261; 31 % H in R-IREDs) as proton-mediating flanking\nresidue and S94 (IRED standard position 111; 45 % T, 33 % S in\nR-IREDs) as imine-polarizing flanking residue, no polar flanking\nresidues were observed.\nIn Y-type IREDs (IRED standard position 187; 100 % Y in S-\nIREDs), the pK\na\nadjustment seems to be enabled by a donor-\npolarizing flanking residue. In contrast to D-type IREDs that\nfeature two nonpolar flanking residues, Y-type feature one\nnonpolar (IRED standard position 191; 51 % L, 39 % M in S-IREDs)\nand one predominantly polar flanking residue (IRED standard\nposition 184; 56 % Q, 36 % A, 1 % L, 5 % M in S-IREDs). This\nsupports the hypothesis of the importance of suitable flanking\nresidues to adapt the pK\na\nof the respective proton donor.\nRecently, some exceptional IREDs lacking the conventional\nproton donors have been identified.\n[24,34]\nFor instance, R-IRED-Ao\nlacks the conserved aspartate at IRED standard position 187.\nTherefore, the conventional catalytic site seems to be “inactive”\nwhile the alternative catalytic site could be considered as\n“active”, as it displays a tyrosine at the alternative donor\nposition (IRED standard position 195; 57 % Y in R-IREDs). As in Y-\ntype IREDs, the pK\na\nadjustment seems to be enabled by a\ndonor-polarizing flanking residue: N241 (IRED standard position\n255; 49 % Q, 14 % H, 12 % N in R-IREDs).\nIn the investigated K!D variants of βHADs,\n[7]\nthe pK\na\nadjustment is enabled by at least one donor-polarizing flanking\nresidue connecting the engineered conventional proton donor\n(D184 in lc-βHAD-Ll; D170 in sc-βHAD-At; D171 in sc-βHAD-Gm)\nwith the alternative proton donor (E191 in lc-βHAD-Ll; D239 in\nsc-βHAD-At; D240 in sc-βHAD-Gm). Such neighboring carbox-\nylates are assumed to result in a higher pK\na\nvalue\n[35]\nand\ntherefore enable the proton transfer to the imine substrate\nunder experimental conditions. Additionally, conventional and\nalternative catalytic sites display a methionine as nonpolar\nflanking residue. In sc-βHAD-At and sc-βHAD-Gm, M169 and\nM170, respectively, could serve as nonpolar flanking residue of\nthe respective conventional proton donor, although their side\nchains are oriented away from the proton donor in the crystal\nstructures. However, upon substrate binding, they might\nreorient toward the proton donor, providing a similar function\nas M141 in lc-βHAD-Ll.\nIn imine-reducing SDRs, the pK\na\nadjustment of the proton\ndonor tyrosine (classical SDR standard position 159) is presum-\nably realized by lysine (classical SDR standard position 163) as\ndonor-polarizing flanking residue, which also adjusts the pK\na\nof\nthe proton donor to enable keto reduction.\n[8,11,12,15,36]\nHowever,\ndue to its positive charge, the electrostatic potential in the\nsubstrate-binding site is detrimental for stabilization of the\npositively charged iminium transition state. This might be\npartially compensated by the acidic character of the proton-\nmediating flanking C150 (classical SDR standard position 146),\nwhich is supported by the reduced specific activity of the\nC150A and C150S variants of SDR-Zt, whereas the C150D variant\nexhibits comparable activity to the wild type. In addition to the\nlocal electrostatic effect of the flanking residues on the proton\ndonor, the overall electrostatic potential in the substrate-\nbinding site of imine-reducing enzymes has been proposed to\nhave a crucial impact on the stabilization of the positively\ncharged iminium transition state.\n[2,7,23]\nThis is supported by the\n50 % decrease in specific activity of the SDR-Zt E212A variant, as\nwell as the overall negative potential at the substrate-binding\nsite of IREDs and of the K!D βHAD variants (except for the\npositively charged carboxyl-binding site).\n[2,37,38]\nThe broad spectrum of accepted substrates by IREDs\n[20,21,39,40]\nindicates that pure lock and key models are not adequate to\nexplain enzyme-catalyzed imine reduction. Recent crystallo-\ngraphic studies report the existence of open and close\nconformations of IRED, βHAD, and SDR complexes as well as\ninduced fit effects upon ligand binding to βHADs and\nSDRs.\n[16,24,26,27]\nHowever, the lack of co-crystallized imine sub-\nstrates limits the deduction of mechanistic principles.

This can be exemplified by\nnoroxomaritidine reductase (SDR-Np): in addition to its physio-\nlogical enone reduction activity,\n[16]\nSDR-Np is able to reduce\ndifferent keto and imine substrates.\n[17]\nThe crystal structure of\nSDR-Np indicates that an intrinsically disordered loop (after β5)\nforms a kinked helix upon substrate binding, resulting in the\ncatalytically active conformation. Remarkably, all investigated\nenzymes display substrate-binding residues situated in helical\nstructures involved in conformational changes or in flexible\nloop regions.\n[16,24,26,27]\nThe functional relevance of dynamic\nfluctuations between multiple protein states has been long\nrecognized,\n[41]\nand is supported by recent studies in the context\nof promiscuous binding and unstructured protein regions.\n[42–45]\nThe combination of intrinsically disordered binding regions,\nthe concept of alternative proton donors, and our proposed\nprinciples for imine reduction provide a model to support the\ninterpretation of reported puzzling observations. Despite the\nexchange of the conventional proton donor by alanine, the R-\nIRED-Sr D170A and R-IRED-St D172A variants (IRED standard\nposition 187) were reported to maintain a considerable residual\nactivity of 15 % and 5 %, respectively.\n[23]\nThis residual activity\ncould be explained by the presence of alternative proton\ndonors, for instance Y219 and Y279 in R-IRED-Sr, and Y221 and\nY283 in R-IRED-St (IRED standard positions 236 and 296,\nrespectively). Tyrosine at standard position 236 is moderately\nconserved in R- and S-IREDs (34 % and 44 %, respectively;\nTable S4), while tyrosine at standard position 296 only occurs in\nR-IREDs (28 %; Table S4). Several residues in the close environ-\nment of Y219 and Y279 in R-IRED-Sr could serve as flanking\nresidues in respect to conformational changes upon substrate\nbinding. Due to the lack of crystallized proton donor variants,\nno distinct flanking residues are proposed. We expect the\nexistence of multiple proton donor positions in IREDs with\nadequate flanking residues for pK\na\nadjustment. Further to the\nherein proposed proton donors, amino acids in reasonable\npositions could be involved in catalysis, provided they result in\na functional proton transfer. This is supported by the character-\nization of a imine reductase lacking the conventional aspartate,\nbut displaying a histidine residue at a neighboring position.\n[34]\nThe existence of multiple alternative proton donors is further\nsupported by the R-IRED-Ao Y179A and Y179F variants which\nmaintained imine-reducing activity.\n[24]\nThe altered enantioselec-\ntivities and kinetic parameters of these variants point toward an\nalternative stabilization of the transition state. Thus, we suspect\nthat Y231 (IRED standard position 245) provides an alternative\nsolution for proton donation as it is considerably conserved in\nR- and S-IREDs (63 % and 13 %, respectively; Table S4), it is\nlocated on a partially unfolded helix providing a flexible\nsubstrate-binding loop, and there are three reasonable flanking\nresidues (M127, Q217, I218). The sc-βHAD-At K170F variant\nresulted in an eightfold increased amine product formation,\n[7]\nwhich can be explained by the presence of D239 as alternative\nproton donor. The protonation catalyzed by this alternative\ndonor might be more efficient due to the less positive binding\nsite of the K170F variant compared to the wild type. The sc-\nβHAD-Gm K171D variant was reported to display a significantly\nlower imine-reducing activity compared to the corresponding\nsc-βHAD-At K170D variant. The different topological arrange-\nment of the flanking residue K239 (as derived from the\nuncomplexed crystal structure) influencing the change in\nsubstrate-binding-site electrostatics (the K171D variant of sc-\nβHAD-Gm still displays a positive charge due to K239) could\nexplain the differences in imine-reducing activity. The K170D/\nN174L sc-βHAD-At and K171D/N175L sc-βHAD-Gm variants\nwere intended to introduce a nonpolar flanking residue as\npresent at IRED standard position 191.\n[7]\nNo activity was\ndetermined, as the variants did not result in stable protein.\nBased on our model, we proposed to additionally knock out the\nalternative proton donor to prevent repulsion. Indeed, the\nK170D/N174L/D239A sc-βHAD-At variant resulted in stable\nprotein, converting 2-methyl-1-pyrroline, 3,4-dihydroisoquino-\nline, and 6-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine with specific activ-\nities (qualitatively determined by NADPH-depletion assay with\nlysate) of 34.5 � 1.2 mU/mL, 33.2 � 0.5 mU/mL, and 35.4 �\n0.9 mU/mL. The K170D/D239A sc-βHAD-At variant showed no\nactivity.\n[46]\nClearly, catalytic machinery alone is not sufficient: the\nsubstrate also has to have access to the catalytic machinery.\nBulky residues in substrate access tunnels or on flexible\nsubstrate-binding structures can impede the entrance or the\nproductive orientation of nonphysiological substrates,\nrespectively.\n[47,48]\nResidues with such functionalities have been\ndescribed as “gatekeepers” for various enzyme families,\n[7,49–51]\nsuch as F231 in sc-βHAD-At, and might also play a role in\nclassical SDRs: in SDR-Zt, the substrate-binding site in the closed\nconformation is narrowed by F202 on the disordered loop/helix\nregion (after β5). This could hinder the efficient orientation and\nstabilization of the substrate toward the catalytic machinery.\nConsequently, the F202A variant results in a tenfold increased\nactivity toward the bulky substrate TMI.\nConclusion\nIn recent years, enzymes with imine-reducing activity have\nincreasingly been discovered in multiple enzyme families with\ndifferent global sequences and structures. This implies that\nimine-reducing activity is independent of homology and\nsuggests the existence of yet hidden commonalities in imine-\nreducing enzymes. The systematic structure-based analysis of\nglobal and local features in imine-reducing IREDs, βHADs, and\nSDRs has revealed common principles in the different enzyme\nfamilies, thus partly rationalizing their shared catalytic scope. As\nthese principles might also apply to other NAD(P)H-dependent\noxidoreductases, our model could support enzyme discovery,\nadd to the diversity of imine-reducing enzymes, and contribute\nto rational enzyme engineering approaches toward imine\nreduction.\n[52]\nChemBioChem\nFull Papers\ndoi.org/10.1002/cbic.202000213\n2694ChemBioChem 2020, 21, 2689 – 2695 www.chembiochem.org © 2020 The Authors.

The highly homologous noroxomariti-\ndine reductase (NR) from Narcissus sp. aff. pseudonarcissus and\nZt_SDR from Zephyranthes treatiae, however, are SDRs with an\nextended imine substrate scope. Comparison with a similar SDR\nfrom Asparagus officinalis (Ao_SDR) exhibiting keto-reducing\nactivity, yet negligible imine-reducing capability, and mining\nthe Short-Chain Dehydrogenase/Reductase Engineering Data-\nbase indicated that NR and Zt_SDR possess a unique active-site\ncomposition among SDRs. Adapting the active site of Ao_SDR\naccordingly improved its imine-reducing capability. By applying\nthe same strategy, an unrelated SDR from Methylobacterium sp.\n77 (M77_SDR) with distinct keto-reducing activity was engi-\nneered into a promiscuous enzyme with imine-reducing\nactivity, thereby confirming that the ability to reduce imines\ncan be rationally introduced into members of the “classical”\nSDR enzyme family. Thus, members of the SDR family could be\na promising starting point for protein approaches to generate\nnew imine-reducing enzymes.\nThe NAD(P)H-dependent enzymatic reduction of C = N bonds\nrepresents an attractive approach to chiral 1 ° , 2 ° , and 3 °\namines.\n[1]\nWhereas imine-reducing enzymes from metabolic\npathways have been known for long,\n[2–4]\ntheir strict substrate\nspecificity make them less attractive for biocatalytic applications\nand has provoked the desire for biocatalysts with a relaxed\nsubstrate scope. Three different strategies have led to such\nimine-reducing enzymes: the identification of new enzyme\nfamilies, enzyme engineering, and/or the exploitation of\ncatalytic promiscuity.\nBy a screening approach, Mitsukura et al. discovered two\nStreptomyces strains capable of reducing the cyclic imine 2-\nmethyl-1-pyrroline.\n[5]\nThe identification of the underlying\nNADPH-dependent oxidoreductases sparked the rise of the\nimine reductase (IRED) enzyme family.\n[6,7]\nBioinformatics\napproaches increased the availability of putative IRED-coding\nsequences, which are categorized in the Imine Reductase\nEngineering Database.\n[8]\nIREDs are known to accept a broad\nrange of cyclic imine compounds as substrates, with some\ncatalyzing the reductive (alkyl)amination of carbonyls as\nwell.\n[9–11]\nRecently, the discovery of an enzyme family of native amine\ndehydrogenases (nat-AmDHs) expanded the portfolio of en-\nzymes suitable for the reductive amination of carbonyls.\n[12]\nThese enzymes were identified by a sequence-driven approach.\nAs nat-AmDHs are not related to IREDs, this exemplifies the\nnatural diversity of imine-reducing enzyme families.\nProtein engineering of enzymes facilitates the generation of\nvariants with desired properties. Successful approaches in the\ncontext of NAD(P)H-dependent C = N reduction have been\ndemonstrated recently. Bommarius and co-workers applied\nseveral rounds of protein engineering to change the substrate\nscope of an amino acid dehydrogenase. The result was a variant\nwith four mutations that catalyzes the reductive amination of\nketones instead of α-keto acids.\n[13]\nMutti and co-workers chose\nan ɛ-deaminating l-lysine dehydrogenase as a scaffold for the\ngeneration of amine dehydrogenases.\n[14]\nNestl and co-workers used β-hydroxy acid dehydrogenases\nas a starting point for mutagenesis experiments. Certain\nmembers of this enzyme family display a similarity to IREDs and\npossess promiscuous C = N reducing activity. This activity was\nenhanced by replacing an active site residue involved in the\nnative catalytic reduction mechanism.\n[15]\nPreviously, we have reported on two homologous, promis-\ncuous short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs) from\nplants capable of reducing C = N and C = O bonds: noroxomar-\nitidine reductase (NR) from Narcissus sp. aff. pseudonarcissus\nand Zt_SDR from Zephyranthes treatiae.\n[16]\nNR was originally\nidentified as an enone reductase (C = C reduction) involved in\nalkaloid biosynthesis,\n[17]\nhighlighting the versatility of SDRs.\nIn general, members of the SDR family are well character-\nized with respect to carbonyl and enone reduction, and several\ncandidates are used in biocatalytic applications. Protein engi-\nneering has mainly been used to modify cofactor preference,\n[19]\nactivity,\n[20]\nstereoselectivity,\n[21]\nor stability\n[22]\nof SDRs. Notably,\n[a] S. Roth, J. Steff, S.

However, our finding along with the\nabove-noted examples of promiscuous C = N reduction suggest\nthat other enzymes may fulfill the prerequisites to behave as\nimine-reducing enzymes. We therefore hypothesized that a\nrational design of imine-reducing activity in SDRs should be\npossible, which is backed by the previous examples of SDR\nengineering.\nHere, we report the generation of a new imine-reducing\nenzyme resulting from a rational mutagenesis approach.\nInspired by the unique active site compositions of NR and\nZt_SDR, four mutations transformed an unrelated SDR with\ndistinct keto-reducing activity into a promiscuous enzyme with\nadditional imine-reducing activity. In addition to our previous\nresults\n[16,18]\nand literature examples,\n[15,24]\nthis highlights that a\nstrict border splitting “ketoreductases” and “imine reductases”\ncan be misleading.\nWe previously identified new imine-reducing SDRs by BLAST\nsearch with the sequence of NR as a template. The highly\nsimilar Zt_SDR (87 % sequence identity) was discovered in\ntranscriptomic data of a related plant species. A “common”\nBLAST resulted in hits with 60–70 % overall sequence identity.\nFrom these hits, an SDR from Asparagus officinalis (Ao_SDR,\n66 % sequence identity) was investigated.\n[16]\nDespite the\nelevated sequence identity, Ao_SDR preferred keto substrates\nand featured only a negligible imine-reducing activity. This\nsuggested that a solely sequence-driven approach is insuffi-\ncient, and SDR-catalyzed C = N reduction probably results from\nan interplay of several key positions.\nWe intended to determine such positions in parallel by\nalanine scanning of Zt_SDR active site residues\n[25]\nand by\nelucidating the structure in complex with NADP\n+\nand an imine\nsubstrate. The structure of Zt_SDR was solved in complex with\nNADP\n+\nand compared well to the structure of NR (see the\nSupporting Information); however, a substrate or inhibitor could\nnot be co-crystallized thus far. The alanine scan revealed that\nnext to the SDR-typical catalytic triad\n[26]\n(positions S144, Y159,\nK163 according to the standard numbering scheme for\n“classical” SDRs\n[27]\n), three proton-donor flanking residues Y100,\nC150, H158 (standard positions 96, 146, 156) mediate imine\nreduction.\n[25]\nThis pattern was extended by polar residues that\nare common in the substrate binding site of NR and Zt_SDR\n(N102, C149, T/S199; standard positions 98, 145, 197), but do\nnot occur at the equivalent positions in Ao_SDR (T124, I171,\nV221). These positions were considered to be promising targets\nfor engineering of imine-reducing activity (Figure 1, Table 1).\nHence, six mutations (F122Y, T124N, I171C, A172C, L180H,\nV221S) were expected to improve the imine-reducing activity of\nAo_SDR. The mutations were gradually introduced by site-\ndirected mutagenesis, and the variants were tested as purified\nenzymes. This enabled the capturing of possible synergistic\neffects of the mutations, while drastically reducing the exper-\nimental effort of screening all 63 possible variants. β-Carboline\n1 was converted in traces (< 5 %) by the wild-type enzyme\n[16]\nand therefore was used as the imine model substrate.

To monitor changes of the ketoreductase\nactivity, the specific activity of the variants was determined with\n(R)-3-methylcyclohexanone (5) as a substrate (Table 2). The\ntwofold variant (F122Y/L180H) with exchanges of flanking\nresidues at standard positions 96 and 156 displayed a slightly\nimproved conversion of 1 (6 %) and a sixfold decreased\nketoreductase activity compared to the wild-type enzyme. Next,\na cysteine residue at standard position 146 was introduced,\nresulting in a further increase in conversion of 1 to 9 %.\nInterestingly, this variant displayed an elevated ketoreductase\nactivity compared to the 2-fold variant. The exchange of valine\nat standard position 197 by serine did not influence the imine-\nreducing capability, but the additional substitution of threonine\nat standard position 98 by asparagine resulted in a 5-fold\nvariant with the highest conversion of 1 (17 %). Its ketoreduc-\ntase activity was reduced to 13 % of the wild-type activity.\nIntroducing a cysteine at standard position 145 to complete the\nsixfold variant resulted in a decrease in imine-reducing activity\nand a further reduction in ketoreductase activity to 1 % of the\nwild-type activity. Thus, the five mutations F122Y/T124N/\nA172C/L180H/V221S significantly promoted the imine-reducing\ncapability of Ao_SDR, although it was still lower than the\ncapability of NR and Zt_SDR.\nTo confirm the functional relevance of the flanking and\nconsensus positions (Figure 1, Table 1), an in silico screening for\nSDRs with imine-reducing activity was performed assuming a\nsimilar structure of “classical” SDRs even at low sequence\nidentity.\n[28]\nTherefore, the Short-Chain Dehydrogenase/Reduc-\ntase Engineering Database\n[27]\nwas scanned separately for\nsequences with tyrosine, asparagine, cysteine, cysteine, histi-\ndine, or threonine/serine at standard positions 96, 98, 145, 146,\n156, or 197, respectively. Interestingly, none of the 130000 SDR\nsequences had more than three matching positions.\nNevertheless, six protein sequences from Amaryllidaceae\ntranscriptomes from the 1000 Plants (1KP) project\n(Table S8)\n[29–33]\nmatched at least four of the six flanking/\nconsensus positions (Table 1). One of these six proteins, the\nSDR from Phycella cyrthanthoides (Pc_SDR, 88 % sequence\nidentity to NR, M98 instead of N), was tested and showed\nimine-reducing activity (Table S9). As the proposed pattern\noccurs only in Amaryllidaceae SDRs, thus representing a tiny\nsubgroup of a large enzyme family, it might be regarded as a\nspecific solution for imine reduction. Nevertheless, we hypothe-\nsized that the pattern derived from NR and Zt_SDR is\nexploitable and transferable to other SDRs.\nTo challenge this hypothesis, we elected to test SDRs as\nwild types and engineered for imine-reducing activity according\nto the established pattern. From the database hits, we chose an\nuncharacterized SDR from Methylobacterium sp. 77 (M77_SDR)\ncontaining Y96 and T197 (35 % sequence identity to NR). As a\nsecond candidate, a GDH from Bacillus subtilis subsp. subtilis str.\n168 (Bs_GDH) was selected, which is known to be active\ntowards a highly reactive iminium compound.\n[18]\nBased on the protein sequence of M77_SDR and the\nengineered variants M77_SDR_opt (F97N, A142C, I143C, S151H)\nand Bs_GDH_opt (E96Y, P98N, V146C, H147C, F155H, N196S),\nsynthetic genes were ordered codon-optimized for expression\nin Escherichia coli. The genes were cloned into pET28a by In-\nFusion cloning, overexpressed in E. coli BL21-Gold(DE3) using\nauto-induction medium,\n[34]\nand purified by Ni \u0000 NTA affinity\nchromatography. Despite several first-shell residues being\nexchanged, the “optimized” variants remained soluble.\nThe catalytic scope of the candidates was explored by\ntesting three imine compounds (1–3), one iminium compound\n(4), and two keto substrates (5, 6), alongside the glucose/GDH\nNADPH regeneration system (Table 3). Both Bs_GDH and Bs_\nGDH_opt were active with ketone 5, but neither catalyzed C = N\nreduction of the tested substrates 1–3. Moreover, Bs_GDH_opt\nlost the GDH activity and the ability to reduce the activated\nderivative of iminium compound 4 (data not shown).\n[18]\nM77_SDR proved to be an active enzyme and converted\nketones 5 and 6 quantitatively with moderate stereoselectivity,\ndisplaying high activity with 5 (28.1 U mg\n\u0000 1\n). These results\nindicate that M77_SDR is a ketoreductase, corroborated by the\nfinding that no C = N reduction was observed with substrates 1–\nTable 1.

As proposed, M77_SDR_opt catalyzed both C = O and C = N\nreduction. While displaying reduced ketoreductase activity\n(1.36 U/mg with 5), M77_SDR_opt accepted imine 1 (6 %\nconversion), imine 2 (28 % conversion, ee > 99 % (R)-2 a), and\niminium 4 (20 % conversion, ee 86 % (R)-4 a) as substrates.\nInterestingly, relative to the wild-type, M77_SDR_opt showed\nan improved stereoselectivity (ee > 93 %) with regard to the\nalcohol products 5 a and 6 a.\nIn summary, we have shown that imine-reducing activity\ncan be introduced into members of the “classical” SDR enzyme\nfamily. We implemented an amino acid pattern, obtained from\nthe imine-reducing SDRs NR and Zt_SDR, in the unrelated\nketoreductase M77_SDR, the latter with no obvious link to\nimine reduction. The resulting 4-fold variant M77_SDR_opt\ncatalyzed as a new activity C = N reduction at the expense of\nC = O reduction activity. This proof-of-concept extends the scope\nof SDR engineering towards imine reduction.\nThe identified pattern enables imine reduction; however, it\nis not necessarily sufficient\n[35]\nas seen for Bs_GDH_opt. The\nprotein scaffold of the engineering target also impacts activity\nas it determines a) the arrangement of the introduced amino\nacids and b) elements that can influence or are required for\nactivity, such as structural flexibility or long-range electrostatic\ninteractions. The results obtained for Pc_SDR indicate that\nstandard position 98 tolerates slight variations, which is in line\nwith the results of the alanine scan of Zt_SDR.\n[25]\nThis has been\nshown for standard position 146 and might also apply for other\npositions of the pattern. Moreover, this illustrates the complex-\nity of the rationale behind imine reduction catalyzed by SDRs,\nas well as the need for a more comprehensive knowledge of\nthe underlying pattern and its influence on the structure–\nfunction relationship.\nIn a more general context, this work underscores that one\nSDR scaffold (e. g., NR, M77_SDR_opt) can meet the require-\nments for different reductive activities (here C = O, C = N reduc-\ntion). With the latter activity being engineered, our work has\nrevealed that the catalytic scope of SDR enzymes can be\nmanipulated, which is in line with the results by Lygidakis et al.\nconcerning C = O and enone reduction.\n[23]\nMoreover, our results\nshow that the starting activity is not a prerequisite for obtaining\na desired novel functionality, here imine reduction. This\nencourages to consider SDRs as scaffolds for generating\nenzymes which catalyze challenging transformations that are\nnot easily amenable by known biocatalysts.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank K.

Ramsden 1, Beatriz Dominguez2, Nicholas J. Turner1†\nImine reductases (IREDs) have shown great potential as catalysts for the asymmetric synthesis of industrially relevant \nchiral amines, but a limited understanding of sequence activity relationships makes rational engineering challenging. \nHere, we describe the characterization of 80 putative and 15 previously described IREDs across 10 different trans-\nformations and confirm that reductive amination catalysis is not limited to any particular subgroup or sequence \nmotif. Furthermore, we have identified another dehydrogenase subgroup with chemoselectivity for imine reduc-\ntion. Enantioselectivities were determined for the reduction of the model substrate 2-phenylpiperideine, and the \neffect of changing the reaction conditions was also studied for the reductive aminations of 1-indanone, acetophe-\nnone, and 4-methoxyphenylacetone. We have performed sequence-structure analysis to help explain clusters in \nactivity across a phylogenetic tree and to inform rational engineering, which, in one case, has conferred a \nchange in chemoselectivity that had not been previously observed.\nINTRODUCTION\nImine reductases (IREDs) are nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide \nphosphate (NADPH)–dependent enzymes that have been applied \nto the stereoselective synthesis of chiral amines through asymmetric \nimine reduction and reductive amination (1, 2). A number of pharma-\nceuticals, agrochemicals, and natural products contain one or more \nchiral amine functionalities, with examples including the anti-  \nParkinson’s agent pramipexole (3 ), the tuberculosis treatment \nethambutol (4 ), and the natural product histrionicotoxin (5 ). \nWhile amine dehydrogenases and transaminases have previously \nbeen exploited in the direct conversion of carbonyl-containing \ncompounds to the corresponding chiral primary amines (6 , 7), \nonly IREDs have been shown to catalyze reductive amination with \nmultiple different amine nucleophiles, including the secondary \namine pyrrolidine (8 ), at concentrations within an order of \nmagnitude of that of the cosubstrate ketone or aldehyde (9). Asym-\nmetric reductive amination requires high chemoselectivity to avoid \ndirect reduction of the carbonyl starting material, and existing \nchemical catalyst systems that fulfill this requirement tend to be \nlimited to a particular class of amine nucleophile, such as anilines \n(10) or ammonia (11).\nThe first IREDs were identified by Mitsukura et al. (12,  13) on \nthe basis of their ability to catalyze the enantioselective reduction of \nthe synthetic imine 2-methylpyrroline. Subsequently, a much broader \nrange of wild-type IREDs have been found and applied to the syn-\nthesis of a range of cyclic amines, including tetrahydroisoquinolines \nand piperidines (14), 3-thiazolines (15), bulky ,-unsaturated imines \n(16), and 2H-1,4-benzoxazines (17). IREDs have also been applied \nin cascades for the deracemization of racemic amines (18) and for \nthe direct synthesis of chiral amines from simple precursors (Fig. 1) \n(19, 20), in some cases with closed-loop recycling of the nicotin-\namide cofactor (21,  22). Recently, they have been used in new \nchemoenzymatic methods for the synthesis of pharmaceutically rel-\nevant dibenz[c,e]azepines (23) and 2,2-disubstituted azepanes (24). \nHowever, despite promising results in the reductive aminations \nof cyclohexanone and a range of aldehydes, for ketones such as \n1-indanone and 4-fluorophenylacetone, more than 20 equivalents \nof amine nucleophile were required to achieve only moderate con-\nversions (2,  9, 25). Likewise, although good conversions were ob-\nserved in the reductive amination of simple cyclic ketones such as \ncyclohexanone with ammonia, no conversion has yet been observed \nusing ammonia for the amination of aldehydes. The scope of reac-\ntions performed by IREDs in nature is generally unknown, although \nthe ArpDHII enzyme from Streptomyces argillaceus, which shares \n36% sequence identity with the reductive aminase from Aspergillus \noryzae (AspRedAm) (2), has been assigned a role in argimycin bio-\nsynthesis (26).\nIn the course of their biochemical characterization, several spe-\ncific residues have been proposed to help control IRED selectivity \nand substrate scope. Hussain et al. (14) had observed that the D172A \nand D172L variants of R-IRED from Streptomyces sp. GF3587 both \nshowed decreases in conversion for more bulky substrates, typically \nalso with a reduction in ee (enantiomeric excess), and Aleku et al. (2) \nthen showed that a Q240A mutant of AspRedAm gives improved \nconversions with certain ketones. However, France et al. (8) noted \nthat only one of the six “key residues” that had been proposed to confer \nactivity in fungal reductive aminases was conserved among several \nbacterial IREDs, which gave high conversions in reductive amination. \nNonetheless, the importance of these residues in reductive aminase \ncatalysis is supported by crystallographic data and engineering studies \n(27). The diversity of active site motifs in characterized IREDs indi-\ncates that this activity may not be confined to a narrow subset of \ndehydrogenases and could be less unusual than first anticipated.\n1School of Chemistry, University of Manchester, Manchester Institute of Biotech-\nnology, 131 Princess Street, Manchester M1 7DN, UK. 2Johnson Matthey, 28 Cam-\nbridge Science Park, Milton Road, Cambridge CB4 0FP, UK.\n*Present address: Wellcome Sanger Institute, Genome Campus, Hinxton, Saffron \nWalden CB10 1SA, UK.\n†Corresponding author.

Conversions of up to 99% were \nachieved with 1.1 equivalents of aniline in the reductive amination \nof cyclohexanone (0.4 g), and a more recent study by Bornadel et al. \n(28) demonstrated intensification of an IRED-catalyzed reductive \namination reaction to reach a space time yield of 12.9 g liter−1 hour−1. \nMost recently, Roiban and co-workers have described the directed \nevolution of an IRED for the synthesis of a lysine specific demethylase 1 \ninhibitor on multikilogram scale, with the transformation run under \nacidic conditions. The most improved variant had significantly higher \nactivity and stability under the desired reaction conditions compared \nto the wild-type enzyme, but because of the lack of an effective \ncolorimetric assay, the work required a sophisticated automated \nplatform. Of 296 amino acids, 256 were varied by single-site satura-\ntion mutagenesis, and in total, more than 9000 variants were screened \nby ultraperformance liquid chromatography across three rounds of \nmutagenesis (29).\nTo explore structure-activity relationships across the IRED family \nmore deeply, we prepared a panel of 95 enzymes, containing 80 \nputative IREDs from fungi, bacteria, and plants alongside 13 previously \ndescribed IREDs (8, 9, 13, 14, 24, 30) and two RedAms (2, 27). Here, \nwe describe their biochemical characterization in five different re-\nductive aminations and the reduction of 2-phenylpiperideine (1 ), \nto establish the substrate scope of wild-type IREDs for chemical \nsynthesis and the further characterization of a subset of these in \nseven more reductive aminations (Fig. 2). For a reductive amination \nwith aniline that typically gave low conversion, the use of cosolvents \nhas been explored as a way of alleviating substrate inhibition and \nincreasing conversion without mutagenesis. An alternative structural \nanalysis approach was then explored, whereby contacts were deter-\nmined between amino acid residues, considering all rotameric states, \nand the docked substrate, which was given a certain degree of \nconformational freedom. These hypothetical contact points were \ncompared across the sequences to determine potential structure-  \nactivity relationships. On the basis of this analysis, an enzyme with \nnegligible activity was mutated to establish the validity of the \nstructure- activity model. Structural differences between fungal \nRedAms and newly characterized IREDs from plants were also \nexamined, to explore whether domain swapping is necessary for \nIRED chemoselectivity. Last, we tested a new hypothesis about the \nubiquity of reductive amination activity by comparing the conversions \nobtained with the biosynthetic bacterial IRED ArpDHII with those \npreviously reported with the reductive aminase AspRedAm.\nRESULTS\nSequence selection and initial characterization\nFor the purposes of this study, we identified a diverse selection of \ngenomic putative IREDs, which were then cloned into Escherichia coli. \nPutative IREDs were initially selected from bacterial and fungal sources \non the basis of searches of the UniProt database (31) and the laboratory \nculture collection for putative proteins with sequence identity of \n>30% with AspRedAm or a bit score higher than 50, but without \nbias toward particular active site motifs. Subsequently, the search \nwas narrowed to proteins identified within plant genomes, and the \npresence of an nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)–binding \ndomain (PF03446) was used to select 26 putative dehydrogenases \nfrom a group with no more than 27% sequence identity with the \nfungal RedAm.\nThe resulting enzyme panel contains previously uncharacterized \nenzymes from a range of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, ranging from \n17 to 62% sequence identity to AspRedAm. The diversity of this panel \nis demonstrated with different putative IREDs across the whole tree \nof life (fig. S1). Rather than falling into a single clade, the fungal \nenzymes are divided into two groups, with two further outliers in the \nputative IREDs p-IR36 and p-IR62 from Fonsecaea multimorphosa \nand Pochonia chlamydosporia, respectively. The putative actinobacteri-\nal IREDs are also split across the tree. The putative dehydrogenases \nthat are of plant origin fall into a distinct clade and match two dif-\nferent Pfam signatures, PF03446 (the NAD-binding domain of \n6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenases) and PF14833. The former spans \napproximately 160 residues from the N terminus and is detected in \nall the sequences considered here. For the putative IREDs from \nplants, the first 120 residues from the N terminus in the same NAD- \nbinding domain also match the signature for the NAD-binding domain \nof 3-hydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenases, which have been compared \nto IREDs in sequence studies by Fademrecht et al. (32).\nThe putative IREDs were initially screened for conversion in the \nasymmetric reduction of 1 to 2-phenylpiperidine 2. Soluble expression \nwas interpreted as good, moderate, or poor, and the observed con-\nversions and enantioselectivities were compared to those of R-IRED \nand S-IRED from Streptomyces sp. (12, 13) that were used as positive \ncontrols (fig. S2). A clarified lysate of cells containing empty \npET-28b(+) vector was used as a negative control. Of 90 cell-free \nextracts, 57 putative IREDs showed moderate or good expression \nbased on SDS–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Sixty percent of \nthe enzymes (54 putative IREDs) gave at least 10% conversion in the \nreduction of 1  after 18 hours, including 10 of those that did not \nexpress well, and 30% of the panel gave >98% conversion. Of the \nenzymes that gave at least 10% conversion to 2, 21 putative IREDs \ngave >90% ee, although only one of these enzymes was (R)-selective. \nWhile S-IRED and p-IR49 were (R)-selective for 2, the closely related \np-IR23, p-IR24, p-IR48, and p-IR68 were all highly (S )-selective. \nHaving collated a diverse panel of enzymes, we then sought to \nexplore their synthetic potential in a range of reductive amination \nreactions, with a view to comparing reaction outcomes across the \nsequence space.\nFig. 1. Synthetic applications of IREDs. Representative examples of biotransfor-\nmations performed with IRED to date (2, 9, 15, 16, 23, 25).\nMontgomery et al., Sci. Adv. 2020; 6 : eaay9320     22 May 2020\nSCIENCE ADVANCES |  RESEARCH ARTICLE\n3 of 12\nNucleophile scope in biocatalytic reductive amination\nTo explore conversions with a lower (2:1) stoichiometry of amine \nnucleophile to cyclohexanone, we characterized the enzyme panel with \nrespect to conversion in the reductive aminations of cyclohexanone \nwith butylamine, phenethylamine, and aniline. The previously \ncharacterized R-IRED and S-IRED from Streptomyces sp. (12,  13), \nSkIRED from Streptomyces kanamyceticus (30), AspRedAm, and its \nhomolog AtRedAm (2 ) were also included as positive controls. \nButylamine and aniline were chosen for being chemically distinct, \nand since phenethylamine shares properties with both, the resulting \nset of conversions would illustrate whether the aryl group or the \nlone pair stabilization of aniline have a more significant effect on \nconversion. While the products of these transformations are not \nknown to be of practical interest, aside from any value added \nthrough amination, they allowed us to map variations in conversion \nand substrate preference across the panel.\nIn the reductive amination of cyclohexanone with cyclopropylamine \nto yield N-cyclopropylcyclohexylamine 3, 57 of the putative IREDs \ngave at least 10% conversion (Fig. 3), and the activities largely correlate \nwith those seen in the reduction of 1. However, while p-IR05 gave \nno measurable conversion in imine reduction, it gave 38% conversion \nto 3. This effect is even more marked for p-IR14, p-IR19, and p-IR83, \nall of which gave more than 80% higher conversion in this reductive \namination reaction compared to imine reduction. The opposite \nsubstrate preference is also noticeable in some cases, particularly \nwith p-IR11 (81% conversion to 2 and 21% conversion to 3).\nIn general, full conversion was not observed with butylamine, \nphenethylamine, or aniline, with only 13 of 90 enzymes appearing \nto give more than 50% conversion to N -butylcyclohexylamine 4 \nafter 18 hours, compared to 52 of 90 for 3. Conversions in the re-\nductive amination of cyclohexanone with phenethylamine to yield \nN-cyclohexylphenethylamine 5 and aniline to yield N-cyclohexylaniline \n6 were somewhat correlated, although only seven enzymes gave \n>30% conversion to 6. SkIRED that was first described in 2013 (30) \nproved to be one of the most active biocatalysts for the reductive \namination of cyclohexanone with aniline, giving 92% conversion. \nOf the enzymes that gave less than 20% conversion to 3 , only \np-IR65 gave any significant conversion in reductive aminations \nat low stoichiometries. This IRED was also the only enzyme in the \npanel which gave >99% conversion in cyclic imine reduction with-\nout concomitant high conversion in the reductive amination of \ncyclohexanone.\nFig. 2. IRED-catalyzed reductive aminations described in this work. Amine nucleophile concentrations (blue), reaction temperatures (red), maximum conversions (black), \nand the IREDs with which the reported maximum conversions were achieved (purple) are shown for each product. Conversions were determined by gas chromatography–\nflame-ionization detection (GC-FID) with comparison to chemically synthesized standards. Enantioselectivities were not determined.

The \nreductive amination of 2-methylcyclohexanone with ammonia to \ngive 2-methylcyclohexylamine 7 was therefore investigated with the \nsame enzyme panel. Ammonia was applied at a higher concentration \nof 400 mM (40 equivalents with respect to 2-methylcyclohexanone), \nwith the ammonium chloride solution also acting as the reaction \nbuffer. Although the conversions to 7 correlated well with the total \nconversions to 3, the reactions with ammonia typically did not go to \ncompletion. The syn/anti-selectivity was also quite poor, which \nsuggests that the methyl group has a limited influence on the mode \nof binding, although there are some general trends where enzymes \nin the same clade largely favor the same diastereomer. For example, \nAspRedAm, AtRedAm, p-IR9, and p-IR16 all favor one product, \nwhereas p-IR58, p-IR88, p-IR78, p-IR50, p-IR89, and p-IR90 favor \nthe other.\nOn the basis of the initial results, 35 of the least active IREDs were \nexcluded from further screening with more challenging substrates. In \nexperiments to date, IREDs have been found to give lower conversions \nwith more sterically demanding amines. For example, with purified \nAspRedAm, 20 equivalents of isopropylamine were required to obtain \nFungal\nenzymes\nPlant\nenzymes\nFig. 3. Reductive amination with primary amines and ammonia. (A) Heterologous expression in E. coli; (B) conversion to 3 with cyclohexanone and 100 mM cyclopropylamine \n(up to >99%); (C) conversion to 4 with cyclohexanone and 20 mM butylamine (up to 93%); (D) conversion to 5 with cyclohexanone and 20 mM phenethylamine (up to 88%); and \n(E) conversion to 6 with cyclohexanone and 20 mM aniline (up to 96%). Cyan and indigo bars illustrate conversions to two diastereomers of 7 with 2-methylcyclohexanone and \n400 mM ammonium chloride (up to 98% combined). Previously described IREDs are labeled in blue. All transformations were performed with 10 mM ketone at 30°C. Conversions \nwere determined by GC-FID with comparison to chemically synthesized standards, with darker colors and larger bars corresponding to higher conversions.\nMontgomery et al., Sci. Adv. 2020; 6 : eaay9320     22 May 2020\nSCIENCE ADVANCES |  RESEARCH ARTICLE\n5 of 12\n94% conversion in the reductive amination of cyclohexanone to \nyield N-isopropylcyclohexylamine 8 (2). Forty-five novel and 13 \npreviously characterized IREDs were screened in the same reaction \nwith 10 equivalents isopropylamine (fig. S3), and the highest con-\nversions to product were obtained with p-IR31 (44%) and p-IR90 \n(49%). However, 53% of the panel gave no conversion, indicating \nthat screening of multiple wild-type enzymes remains necessary to \nfind hits for more challenging nucleophile substrates.\nBiocatalytic reductive amination with novel  \nketone substrates\nThe smaller panel of IREDs was then tested in the reductive amination \nof a number of prochiral ketones (Fig. 4). The reaction of 1-indanone \nwith propargylamine was studied at both 30° and 37°C, with greater \nconversions to N-propargyl-1-aminoindan 9 being observed across \nthe panel at the higher temperature. Acetophenone, a precursor to \nactive pharmaceutical ingredients such as rivastigmine (33), was then \nused as a substrate with either 10 equivalents of cyclopropylamine \nat 37°C or 20 equivalents at 30°C. While none of the enzymes gave \nfull conversion to N-(1-phenylethyl)cyclopropanamine 10, the mean \nconversion to product at 30°C was higher than for that of 1-indanone \n(19% versus 10%), as was the highest conversion obtained (59% ver-\nsus 28%). When mapped phylogenetically, the enzymes’ conversion \nto 10 correlates well with that observed for the reductive amination \nof 1-indanone, although some show a preference for one over the \nother. Again, the IREDs gave higher conversions at 37°C than at \n30°C, although the highest conversions (59% with p-IR58 and 55% \nwith p-IR13) were obtained at 30°C with the higher concentration \nof cyclopropylamine. Some groups of related enzymes give similar \nconversions, with the fungal enzymes generally giving better con-\nversions than R-IRED, SkIRED, and their bacterial homologs.\nThe stability and substrate scope of the novel IREDs was further \ninvestigated through the reductive amination of two phenylacetone \nderivatives under different conditions. The mean conversions in the \nreductive aminations of 4-hydroxyphenylacetone with cyclopropylamine \nto give 4-[2-(cyclopropylamino)propyl]phenol 11 at 30°C and those \nof 4-methoxyphenylacetone with cyclopropylamine to give N -[1-\n(4-methoxyphenyl)-2-propanyl]cyclopropanamine 12 at 37°C were \n24 and 35%, respectively, with 10 mM ketone, although both reac-\ntions went to completion with at least seven IREDs. For the reductive \namination of 4-methoxyphenylacetone, with 10 mM ketone and \n100 mM cyclopropylamine, 10 enzymes gave >90% conversion. \nWhen the transformation was repeated with 100 mM ketone and \n200 mM amine nucleophile, only p-IR06, p-IR13, p-IR16, and p-IR23 \ngave >90% conversion, indicating that these enzymes have greater \nstability under increased substrate loading. Substrate inhibition is a \nlimiting factor in the application of enzymes on a larger scale, the \nability of these enzymes to tolerate high substrate loading demon-\nstrates these enzymes are good tools for process chemistry. Note that \nthe increased ketone concentration without a proportional increase \nin the amount of cyclopropylamine leads to an improved reaction \nstoichiometry of 2:1, which has not previously been demonstrated for \nIRED-catalyzed reductive amination of a phenylacetone derivative.\nLast, the enzyme panel was characterized in terms of its activity \nin the reductive amination of methoxyacetone to yield N-benzyl-1-\nmethoxy-2-propylamine 13 (fig. S4), to explore the possibility of \naccessing members of the chloroacetanilide family of herbicides. The \npanel was also screened in the reductive amination of cyclohexanone \nwith benzylamine to yield N -benzylcyclohexylamine 14, with the \nconversion data serving as a control for variations in amine substrate \nscope. Three enzymes, p-IR06, p-IR17, and p-IR79, gave greater than \n30% conversion with methoxyacetone, and these IREDs also gave >60% \nconversion in the reductive amination of cyclohexanone with \nbenzylamine. Several typically productive enzymes including p-IR16, \np-IR23, p-IR63, and SkIRED gave no conversion with methoxyacetone.\nReaction intensification with aniline\nWith a large set of sequence and conversion data in hand, we elected \nto explore the use of cosolvents as a way of increasing conversion in \nreductive amination without resorting to directed evolution. The \nreductive amination of cyclohexanone with aniline catalyzed by \np-IR89 was selected as a model transformation in which moderate \nconversion had been obtained, but the reaction did not go to comple-\ntion within 24 hours. To profile the effect of solvents with different \npolarities, we investigated different percentages of cyclohexane, \nmethanol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), and tert-butyl methyl ether \n(MTBE) (table S1). Of the four tested cosolvents, cyclohexane was \nthe best tolerated, with 10, 20, and 50% by volume all giving higher \nconversions than a purely aqueous transformation [up to 41% with \n10% (v/v) cyclohexane]. MTBE and ethanol were inhibitory, while up \nto 20% (v/v) DMSO was well tolerated (31% conversion after 18 hours). \nA complete lack of DMSO appeared to have a deleterious effect on con-\nversion compared to the screening conditions, where the addition \nof substrates from 1 M stock solutions gave a final composition of \n3% (v/v) DMSO. In further experiments, conversion to 6 reached 81% \nwhen the reaction was run with 50 mM cyclohexanone and 100 mM \naniline with a 200- l layer of cyclohexane cosolvent (Table 1). \nPushpanath et al. (7) have previously demonstrated that a biphasic \nreaction system can lead to improved conversions with amine \ndehydrogenases, an effect that was attributed to alleviation of product \ninhibition, and this would explain the improvement in conversion \nobserved here, since aniline has a relatively low solubility in water \ncompared to cyclohexane. \nStructure-activity relationships\nIn analyzing the results of screening across a variety of ketone and \namine substrate combinations, we observed markedly different sub-\nstrate specificities between several enzymes with high sequence identity \nand similar expression levels. We also observed some grouping of \nenantioselectivities in imine reduction based on sequence similarity. \nTo shed light on some of the observed trends, we performed a \nsequence-structure analysis using the SmartScaffold approach. This \nanalysis involves advanced, multitemplate homology modeling, flexible \ndocking, and a custom functionality Structure and Ligand-based and \nActive site Prediction (SLAP) that defines the extended active site \nthrough the study of steric clashes and contacts between the protein \nmodel and a conformational ensemble of the best scoring docked poses.\nOn the basis of structure-guided sequence alignment of active \nsite residues for six enzymes from the original panel, we determined \nthat the two strongly (R)-selective enzymes (p-IR49 and S-IRED) \nhave the residues Pro 121, Phe 176, Met/Ile 210, and Ser 243 based on \nAspRedAm numbering, while several of the strongly (S )-selective \nenzymes including R-IRED, p-IR64, and p-IR48 have Thr 121, Met/\nLeu176, Phe/Trp210, and Ala243. The Pro121/Phe176 combination cor-\nresponds to the SkIRED 139/194 motif used by Fademrecht et al. \n(32) in their selectivity classification of putative IREDs, although \nthis categorization does not hold true for all IREDs described to \ndate (9, 34).\nMontgomery et al., Sci. Adv. 2020; 6 : eaay9320     22 May 2020\nSCIENCE ADVANCES |  RESEARCH ARTICLE\n6 of 12\nWe also observed that several bacterial IREDs, such as SkIRED \nand p-IR23, gave higher conversions in the reductive amination re-\nactions with phenethylamine and aniline than the fungal reductive \naminases AspRedAm and AtRedAm. A comparison of the active \nsite residues highlighted in mechanistic studies of fungal RedAms \n(27) across eight of the most active novel IREDs, as well as AspRedAm, \nSkIRED, p-IR23, and p-IR48, shows that only Asp 169 is fully con-\nserved, although the bacterial IREDs do have several residues in \nPlant\nenzymes\nFungal\nenzymes\nFig. 4.

Previously described IREDs are \nlabeled in blue. Conversions were determined by GC-FID with comparison to chemically synthesized standards, with darker colors corresponding to higher conversions.\nMontgomery et al., Sci. Adv. 2020; 6 : eaay9320     22 May 2020\nSCIENCE ADVANCES |  RESEARCH ARTICLE\n7 of 12\ncommon (table S2). Because of the diversity of sequences within the \npanel, a more detailed comparison focused on groups of well-expressed \nIREDs with high sequence identity that gave markedly different \nconversions.\np-IR23 and p-IR48 were both well expressed and gave >99% \nconversion to product in the reductive amination of cyclohexanone \nwith cyclopropylamine, but p-IR23 gave much higher conversion in \nthe reductive amination with aniline (96% versus 5%). Homology \nmodels of p-IR23 and p-IR48 were generated using the “closed” \nform of AspRedAm [Protein Data Bank (PDB) code: 5G6S] as a \ntemplate, and the substrates cyclohexanone and aniline were docked \nto determine which residues they would be likely to interact with. \nThe result was a list of 23 residues that could come into contact with \none or both of the substrates (Fig. 5A). By limiting the analysis to \nthis subset of residues, it becomes clearer how the activity of \np-IR48 in the reductive amination of cyclohexanone with aniline \nmight be improved through rational mutagenesis, especially since \n19 are conserved between p-IR23 and p-IR48, with four amino \nacids potentially having a greater effect on substrate binding. The \namino acids in AspRedAm-equivalent positions 170 (Ser/Thr), 176 \n(Leu/Met), and 180 (Met/Leu) are the most similar in terms of their \nchemical properties, making 244 (Leu/Phe) a clear candidate for \nmutagenesis. Two mutants of p-IR48 were generated, in which either \nAspRedAm-equivalent residue 244 (p-IR48 F246L) or residues 170, \n176, 180, and 244 (p-IR48 T172S/M178L/L182M/F246L) were switched \nwith those in p-IR23. These enzymes were expressed, purified, and \ntested for conversion in the reductive amination of cyclohexanone \nwith two equivalents of aniline at several time points alongside \npurified wild-type p-IR23 and p-IR48 (Fig. 5B). The quadruple mutant \nof p-IR48 was unstable and gave negligible, but the F246L mutant \ngave increased conversion compared to the wild-type (6% versus \n2% over 24 hours). This mutation also gave rise to an increase in the \namount of alcohol by-product formed due to direct reduction of the \nketone. Since the conversion to both possible products showed a \nthreefold increase from the wild-type to the mutant, it is not clear \nwhether the mutation has increased alcohol dehydrogenase activity \nat the expense of IRED activity or whether opening of the active site \nhas resulted in higher activity in all capacities.\nWe also considered whether the different residues at AspRedAm- \nequivalent position 210 (Tyr in p-IR23 versus Phe in p-IR48), which \nwere not picked up using the analysis platform but had been shown \nto confer changes in activity for AspRedAm (2), might explain the \ndifference in conversion with aniline. To explore this, we tested the \ncorresponding F209Y mutant of p-IR48 for conversion to 6 under \nthe same conditions. However, no conversion to the secondary \namine was observed. Although this does not confirm that the list of \ncontact points identified by the SmartScaffold tool is exhaustive, in \nthis case, it appears that residue 210 is also not solely responsible for \ndifferences in conversion between the two wild-type enzymes.\nThe same sequence-structure analysis can be used to make similar \ncomparisons with the other IRED and substrate combinations. For \nexample, p-IR08 and p-IR13 both gave full conversion in the reductive \namination of 4-hydroxyphenylacetone with cyclopropylamine to yield \n11, yet p-IR07 and p-IR28 gave only 30 and 11% conversion respectively. \nHere, the results of homology modeling with AspRedAm and docking \nwith 11 indicated 41 residues that could potentially be in contact with \nthe product, of which 23 are conserved across all five enzymes (table S3). \nSimilarly, no single sequence motif appears to preclude activity toward \nmethoxyacetone, although 10 of 27 identified contact point residues \nare not shared by any other active enzymes in the panel.\nLast, noting that the novel IREDs from plants have low sequence \nidentity with AspRedAm and fall into a distinct clade on the phylo-\ngenetic tree, we used homology modeling to investigate their structure. \np-IR14 from Arabidopsis thaliana shares 26% sequence identity to \nthe -hydroxyacid dehydrogenase from the same organism (-HADAt; \nPDB code: 3DOJ) but only 18% sequence identity with AspRedAm. \nAlthough these enzymes showed markedly lower soluble expression \nin E. coli, several including p-IR14, p-IR-31, and p-IR56 gave >90% \nconversion in the reductive amination of cyclohexanone with cyclo-\npropylamine. Crucially, this transformation requires that the enzyme \nbe chemoselective for the imine over the cyclohexanone, direct \nreduction of which would yield cyclohexanol. Not only do these \nenzymes have different amino acids in all areas of their structure \nproposed to be important for catalysis, but on the basis of homology \nmodeling with -HADAt, they also appear to have a different quaternary \nstructure to previously characterized IREDs such as AspRedAm (fig. S5). \nRather than interlocking, the two subunits sit parallel, a structural dif-\nference that had previously been proposed to distinguish -hydroxyacid \ndehydrogenases from IREDs (32). These results, along with recent \nmutagenesis studies performed by Nestl and co-workers (35), indicate \nthat IREDs may not require domain swapping to exhibit their unique \ncatalytic properties.\nReductive amination with ArpDHII from S. argillaceus\nIn the course of this study, an IRED (ArpDHII) was identified in the \nbiosynthesis of polyketide alkaloids in S. argillaceus ( 26).

S6). On the basis of the data obtained through \nscreening, we came to believe that reductive amination catalysis is a \npromiscuous activity common to almost all IREDs and felt that \nsimilar conversions being obtained using an IRED with a known \ncyclic imine natural substrate would support this conclusion. Purified \nArpDHII was therefore tested for conversion in several biotransforma-\ntions that had previously been reported with purified AspRedAm, \nto compare its activity and substrate scope (table S4) (2). ArpDHII \ngave lower conversion than AspRedAm in 7 of 10 reactions, and no \nconversion was observed in the reductive amination of 1-indanone \nwith 250 mM propargylamine. However, the S. argillaceus enzyme \ndid give good conversion to 3 (93% after 18 hours), and the reduc-\ntive amination of hydrocinnamaldehyde was successful with three \ndifferent amine nucleophiles, giving >89% conversion to product in \nall cases.\nDISCUSSION\nIn this study, we have provided a more complete description of the \nIREDs and RedAms as a diverse family of promiscuous dehydrogenases \nand improved tools to map IRED sequence-activity relationships. \nWe identified 45 novel IREDs, 33 of which gave >10% conversion in \nreductive amination at a 2:1 amine:ketone stoichiometry, from a \npanel of 80 putative dehydrogenase enzymes including 25 from plant \norigin in the “twilight zone” of sequence identity with AspRedAm. \nOf these, 12 enzymes were found to catalyze the reductive amina-\ntion of cyclohexanone with cyclopropylamine (>10% conversion), \nincluding one with just 17.1% sequence identity with AspRedAm \n(p-IR56 from Nicotiana attenuata).\nEmpirical characterization of the putative IREDs alongside 15 pre-\nviously described IREDs across 12 substrate combinations in reductive \namination led to the identification of biocatalysts for six new substrate \ncombinations, including six enzymes that effectively (>70% conversion) \ncatalyze the reductive amination of 4-methoxyphenylacetone at \n100 mM ketone concentration and a 1:2 stoichiometry with cyclo-\npropylamine. However, the reductive aminations of both 1-indanone \nand acetophenone appear to always require >10 equivalents of amine \nnucleophile to achieve good conversion to product. Of the novel \nIREDs, p-IR09 and p-IR16 have been identified as good scaffolds \nfor engineering, since they are active, tolerate increased substrate \nconcentrations, express well, and their close homology with AspRedAm \nmeans that their active site residues are more likely to be mapped \nA 13 93 118 121 122 124 169 1701 72 1731 76 177\nAspRedAm MN IV PM DL LL MY\np-IR23 MS IT PF DS LL LW\np-IR48 MS IT PF DT LL MW\n180 214 217 235 239 240 244 2462 47 2802 81\nAspRedAm FM YS MQ VN ID L\np-IR23 MV AAAH LH LD F\np-IR48 LV AAAH FH LD F\nB EntryE nzyme Time\n(hours)\nCyclohexanol\n(%) 6 (%)\n1 p-IR48 31 <1\n2 62 1\n3 24 32\n4 p-IR48\nF246L\n32 5\n5 65 6\n6 24 10 6\n7 p-IR48\nT172S/\nM178L/\nL182M/\nF246L\n3< 1< 1\n8 6< 1< 1\n9 24 11\n10 p-IR23 3< 11 3\n11 6< 11 6\n12 24 <1 28\nAspRedAm\np-IR23\np-IR48\nFig. 5.

Nonetheless, no single enzyme gave the best conversion \nfor every substrate combination, and no single clade contains all the \nmost active enzymes for a given transformation. For example, p-IR57 \nshares only 23.5% sequence identity with SkIRED, yet they gave \ncomparable conversions to 3 and 11. For the reductive amination of \ncyclohexanone with aniline, where substrate inhibition limits turn-\nover, a biphasic reaction system with cyclohexane has been shown \nto significantly improve total conversion to product. This highlights \nthe significant role of reaction conditions in biocatalysis, a factor \nthat is often not explored in initial screening of wild-type enzymes \nor engineered variants.\nDespite their diversity, the active novel IREDs herein all catalyze \nreductive amination of the model substrate cyclohexanone, yet no \nsingle enzyme was found to give the highest conversion across all \nthe tested reaction conditions and substrate combinations. Nonethe-\nless, where resources are limited, we conclude that a lack of conver-\nsion in both the reduction of 1  and the reductive amination of \ncyclohexanone with cyclopropylamine might be a sufficient basis \nto exclude an enzyme from further screening.\nOn the basis of the comparison of conversions to product with \npositioning on a phylogenetic tree, it appears that the substrate \nscope of an IRED in terms of carbonyl compounds and amine nucleo-\nphiles might be controlled by different regions in the protein structure. \nA sequence-structure analysis has been used to map possible contact \npoints for a subset of enzymes and substrate pairs, and interchange \nof residues between p-IR23 and p-IR48 highlighted a possible role \nof Leu/Phe244 (AspRedAm numbering) in catalysis and selectivity. \nThis residue is also the only identified contact point for the reduc-\ntive amination of 4-hydroxyphenylacetone with cyclopropylamine, \nwhich varies between IREDs p-IR07 and p-IR08, despite the consider-\nable difference in conversion obtained with cell-free extracts con-\ntaining the two enzymes (30 and 99%, respectively). Both were well \nexpressed in E. coli, so it seems unlikely that the discrepancy would \nbe due to a difference in biocatalyst concentration alone, although \nstability could play a role. However, while for 6, the higher-converting \np-IR23 does not have Phe at this position, for 12, the presence of \nPhe at position 244 is associated with the higher conversion.\nThe approach described herein would be bolstered by an improved \nactive site model based on crystal structures with complementary \nmolecular dynamics simulations, to account for domain movements \nduring catalysis (2, 27), and the use of this method to perform semi-\nrational engineering would most likely expedite the development of new \nIRED-catalyzed processes compared to a very broad directed evolution \napproach such as that described by Schober et al. (29). Where the \ngoal is to improve an enzyme’s stability under process parameters, it \ncan be necessary to target residues away from the active site, and tools \nto predict the results of these changes are still in their infancy. Even with \nour systematic approach, we have demonstrated that it is difficult to \neffect a change in activity of an IRED, especially with the concomitant \neffects of sequence changes on heterologous expression and stability.\nLast, the study of the biosynthetic enzyme ArpDHII showed that \nan IRED that evolved to reduce cyclic imines can still effectively \nperform intermolecular reductive amination with certain substrates \nand suggests that “reductive aminase” activity observed to date in \nenzymes of fungal is likely to be a result of enzyme promiscuity. It \nappears that the majority of IREDs can usefully be applied in inter-\nmolecular reductive amination and this activity is not limited to a \nsingle set of active site residues. For the reductive amination of cy-\nclohexanone with aniline, the highest conversions were obtained with \nenzymes from bacteria. The very high conversions to 3, and in all \nthree reductive aminations of hydrocinnamaldehyde, suggest that \nArpDHII shares the excellent chemoselectivity of AspRedAm. We \nbelieve that this is because ArpDHII evolved to only reduce the cyclic \nimine nigrifactin without also reducing the carbonyl in the hydro-\nlyzed aminoketone form or the polyketide intermediates in argimycin \nbiosynthesis (26). The occurrence of IRED-catalyzed reductive \namination as a promiscuous activity could explain why it is a rela-\ntively slow process compared to other biocatalytic aminations and \nalso why, in our case, attempts to engineer for an increase in reduc-\ntive amination activity have also lead to increased ketoreduction.\nIn summary, the data presented herein demonstrate that IRED \nsequence-activity relationships are highly substrate dependent, although \nmany residues close to and within the active site are highly conserved \nbetween enzymes. The knowledge that an enzyme with cyclic imine \nnatural substrates can also catalyze intermolecular reductive amination \nprovides a new avenue for biocatalyst discovery, and sequence-structure \nanalysis offers a way to limit the scope of saturation mutagenesis \nexperiments, which is of benefit in directed evolution experiments \nwhere chromatographic analysis can become cost-limiting. There \nremains a strong need for reliable high-throughput screening methods, \nwith the potential benefits from IRED engineering having been \nrobustly demonstrated (29). In addition, the fact that direct keto-\nreduction activity can be instilled in IREDs through point mutations \nsupports earlier work, indicating that the chemoselectivity of dehy-\ndrogenases is tunable through mutagenesis (35). However, this type \nof promiscuity has implications in terms of other assays, since the \nactivity of wild-type and mutant IREDs in reductive amination has \nfrequently been measured using NADPH oxidation assays, in which \nimine reduction and ketoreduction are indistinguishable (2, 27, 36).\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nChemicals, media, and reagents\nCommercially available chemicals and reagents were purchased from \nSigma-Aldrich (Poole, Dorset, UK), Alfa Aesar (Karlsruhe, Germany), \nor Fluorochem (Hadfield, Derbyshire, UK) unless otherwise stated \nand used without further purification.

Adv. 2020; 6 : eaay9320     22 May 2020\nSCIENCE ADVANCES |  RESEARCH ARTICLE\n10 of 12\nDH5 cells were purchased from Invitrogen (Carlsbad, CA, USA). \nCDX-901 glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) was purchased from \nCodexis (Redwood City, CA, USA), and GDH-101 was supplied by \nJohnson Matthey (Cambridge, UK).\nSoftware and sequence-structure analysis\nProtein and DNA sequences were selected and downloaded from \nthe UniProt (31) and National Center for Biotechnology Information \nonline databases (37). Plasmid and primer design were performed \nusing SnapGene software (GSL Biotech, Chicago, USA). Phylogenetic \ntrees were produced using the Clustal Omega online tool (38), and \ndendrograms for the presentation of screening data were produced \nusing the iToL (Interactive Tree of Life) online tool (European \nMolecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany) (39). The \nproprietary SmartScaffold approach from Johnson Matthey was used \nfor the sequence and structure analysis. The approach involves \nnumerous steps, including advanced, multitemplate homology \nmodeling, flexible docking, and a custom functionality (SLAP) that \ndefines the extended active site through the study of steric clashes \nand contacts between the protein model and a conformational en-\nsemble of the best scoring docked poses. The homology modeling \nand docking use the Prime and Glide functionalities of Maestro 11.9 \nsoftware (Schrödinger, Cambridge, MA, USA) with default parameters.\nSelection and cloning of putative IRED sequences\nPutative IRED sequences were selected either by a BLAST with the \nsequence of AspRedAm (2) as a query, across the full database, or \nlimited to mammalian, cyanobacterial, plant, or extremophile genomes \nor by a search of the Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes \n(40) for proteins with >30% sequence identity to AspRedAm, or a \nbit-score of greater than 50, within the genomes of organisms in the \nlaboratory culture collection. Where possible, these enzymes were \ncloned from live cultures, and where this was unsuccessful, the gene \nwas instead purchased as a synthetic construct in a generic vector. \nTwo more were cloned from purchased genomic DNA, but the rest \nof the putative IREDs for the panel were purchased from GeneArt \n(Regensburg, Germany) as DNA strings that were codon-optimized \nfor E. coli using their GeneOptimizer online tool (41). These were \nsubcloned directly into a cut pET28b(+) vector purchased from Novagen \n(Darmstadt, Germany), using NdeI and XhoI restriction sites by means \nof an In-Fusion HD Cloning kit (Takara Bio, Kusatsu, Japan) accord-\ning to the manufacturer’s protocol. The constructs were then trans-\nformed into chemically competent E. coli BL21 (DE3) and DH5 and \nwere also transferred to Prozomix Ltd. for production according to \ntheir internal protocols (24). Sequencing of the colonies resulting from \nsubcloning into pET-28b(+) revealed several deviations from the expected \nsequences (see section S2.4), and in the case of one enzyme from our \nin-house culture collection, the resulting protein sequence showed \nsignificant divergence from that listed in the UniProt database (31), \nmost likely due to cloning from a different Streptomyces rimosus strain. \nThe enzymes that were successfully cloned were assigned codes from \np-IR01 to p-IR90. Of the 80 previously uncharacterized putative IREDs, \n21 are of fungal origin. In addition to these, a further 22 IREDs from \nplants and 1 enzyme of mammalian origin were selected. The rest of \nthe panel was made up of IREDs from a range of bacterial origins.\nExpression and purification of IREDs\nSingle colonies of E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells transformed with the re-\nquired plasmid were used to inoculate 5-ml precultures in LB medium \nsupplemented with kanamycin (30 mg liter −1), which were grown \novernight at 37°C and 250 rpm. For all IREDs except AspRedAm, \nwhich was produced as previously described (2), 2-liter baffled flasks \ncontaining 400 ml of LB medium were autoclaved and then supple-\nmented with kanamycin (30 mg liter−1), before being inoculated with \nthe overnight cultures. The cells were grown in a shaking incubator \nat 37°C and 250 rpm to an optical density at 600 nm of 0.6 to 0.8, \nwhereby protein expression was induced by addition of IPTG (0.1 mM). \nCell growth was continued at 20°C and 250 rpm overnight. The cells \nwere then harvested by centrifugation [4°C and 2831 relative cen-\ntrifugal field (rcf) for 20 min] and washed with potassium phos-\nphate buffer [100 mM (pH 7.0)]. Wet cells were resuspended in \n500% (v/w) Tris (hydroxymethyl) aminomethane hydrochloride (Tris-\nHCl) buffer [100 mM (pH 8.0)], and lysis was performed by ultra-\nsonication (4°C for 20 min, 30-s pulse, 30-s off, repeat 20 times). The \nresulting suspension was centrifuged (39,191 rcf for 40 min), and \nthe supernatant was used directly or flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen \nand either stored at −80°C or lyophilized and stored at −20°C \nuntil use.\nBiocatalytic reduction of 1 with cell-free extract\nTo a pH-adjusted solution of d-glucose (10 mol, 20 mM) and NADP+ \n(0.25 mol, 0.5 mM) in tris-HCl buffer [100 mM (pH 8.0)] were \nadded B. subtilis GDH cell-free extract (50  l) and IRED cell-free \nextract (2.0 mg, 4 g liter −1) from solutions (10 g liter −1) in tris-HCl \nbuffer [100 mM (pH 8.0)]. Imine 1  (5  mol, 10 mM) was added \nfrom a 1 M stock solution in DMSO to give a total reaction volume \nof 500 l. Reactions were incubated at 30°C and 250 rpm for 24 hours, \nafter which they were quenched by addition of 5 M NaOH (50  l) \nand extracted into tert-butyl methyl ether (2 × 500 l). The organic \nfractions were combined, dried over anhydrous MgSO 4, and ana-\nlyzed for conversion by GC–flame-ionization detection (FID). The \nsamples were subsequently derivatized by addition of triethylamine \n(5 l) and acetic anhydride (5  l), followed by incubation at 30°C \nand 250 rpm for 5 min. The reactions were quenched with 5 M NaOH \n(50 l), and the phases were separated. The organic phase was dried \nover anhydrous MgSO 4 and analyzed for enantiomeric excess by \nGC-FID. We estimate the limit of detection to be approximately \n0.05 mM, or 0.5% conversion/1% ee in 10 mM transformation, and \nthe limit of quantification to be closer to 1 mM or 10% conversion/20% \nee for a typical transformation, based on an SD of 5%.\nTypical procedure for screening in biocatalytic reductive \namination with cell-free extract\nTo pH-adjusted solutions of amine nucleophile (10 mol, 20 mM) \nin tris-HCl buffer [100 mM (pH 8.0)] in a 96-well plate were added \nd-glucose (50 mol, 50 mM) and NADP+ (0.25 mol, 0.5 mM) followed \nby GDH-101 cell-free extract (0.5 mg, 1.0 g liter −1) and IRED cell-\nfree extract (2.0 mg, 4 g liter −1) from solutions (10 g liter−1) in tris-\nHCl buffer [100 mM (pH 8.0)]. The ketone substrate (5 mol, 10 mM) \nwas added from a 1 M stock solution in DMSO to give a total reac-\ntion volume of 500 l. Reactions were incubated at 30°C and 300 rpm \nfor 24 hours, after which they were quenched by addition of \n1 M NaOH (300 l) and extracted into tert-butyl methyl ether (2 × 500 l) \nusing a Hamilton MicroLab STAR liquid handling system. The \ncombined organic phases were analyzed by GC-FID. Where deriva-\ntization was required, triethylamine (5 l) and acetic anhydride (5 l) \nwere added, and the samples were incubated at 30°C and 250 rpm \nfor 5 min.

Since their discovery in 2011, many previously unknown\nIREDs have been identiﬁed, biochemically and structurally characterized and categorized into families.\nHowever, the catalytic mechanism and guiding principles for substrate speciﬁcity and stereoselectivity\nremain disputed. Herein, we describe the crystal structure ofS-IRED-Ms from Mycobacterium smegmatis\ntogether with its cofactor NADPH.S-IRED-Ms belongs to theS-enantioselective superfamily 3 (SFam3)\nand is the ﬁrst IRED from SFam3 to be structurally described. The data presented provide further\nevidence for the overall high degree of structural conservation between diﬀerent IREDs of various\nsuperfamilies. We discuss the role of Asp170 in catalysis and the importance of hydrophobic\namino acids in the active site for stereospeciﬁcity. Moreover, a separate entrance to the active site,\npotentially functioning according to a gatekeeping mechanism regulating access and, therefore,\nsubstrate speciﬁcity is described.\nKeywords: biocatalysis; crystal structure; enzyme; 2-ethylhexanol; imine reductase; substrate binding;\nsubstrate soaking\n1. Introduction\nEver since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued regulatory guidelines for the\ndevelopment of stereoisomeric drugs in 1992 [1], the search for a cost-eﬀective (and in recent history\nalso preferably ecologically sustainable) way to generate enantiomerically pure compounds has\nbecome a primary concern for the pharmaceutical industry. Beginning with (S)-(+)-Ibuprofen in 1994,\nmany chirally switched or de novo synthesized enantiomerically pure drugs have been introduced\ninto the market, leading to 44% of FDA-approved small-molecule active pharmaceutical ingredients\n(APIs) in 2015 containing one or more chiral centers [2].\nChiral amines are ubiquitously present in nature and among them, secondary amines play an\nimportant role. For example, heterocyclic, sulfur-containing amines, in particular 3-thiazolidines,\nare used in a broad spectrum of pharmaceuticals, most notably as intermediates in the synthesis\nof β-lactam antibiotics, but also in compounds with anti-inﬂammatory, antiviral or anti-cancerous\neﬀects [3,4]. Consequentially, the asymmetric synthesis of chiral secondary amines has also become\none major focus of the industry and many chemical methods to achieve this goal based on the\nreduction of the C =N bond exist, for example the asymmetric hydrogenation of prochiral imines\nBiomolecules 2020, 10, 1130; doi:10.3390/biom10081130 www.mdpi.com /journal/biomolecules\nBiomolecules 2020, 10, 1130 2 of 13\nwith transition metal catalysts or stable organic hydrogen donors [5,6]. These methods often su ﬀer\nfrom major drawbacks like high costs due to the need for higher amounts of expensive catalysts\nand hazardous reaction conditions. Furthermore, 3-thiazolidines proved to be all but inaccessible by\nestablished reduction technologies as of yet, those failing because of catalyst-poisoning, low reactivity,\nundesired ring-opening of the product or low enantioselectivity and yields [7,8].\nIn search for reliable and more environmentally friendly methods applicable under milder\nconditions, biocatalytic approaches have been increasingly pursued after the discovery of enzymes\ncapable of catalyzing the asymmetric reduction of C=N bonds, most prominently the Candida albicans\ndihydrofolate reductase [9]. In the early 2010s, Mitsukura et al. discovered, puriﬁed and characterized\nNADPH-dependent imine reductases (IREDs) from Streptomyces strains, a new enzyme class capable\nof the conversion of heterocyclic prochiral imines to chiral amines with high enantioselectivity [10,11].\nBased on their results, extensive data mining based on sequence similarity revealed hundreds of new,\npreviously unknown IREDs [ 12]. Crystallographic studies so far indicate a close similarity in the\noverall structure of these enzymes. They consist of an N-terminal Rossmann-fold and a C-terminal\nhelical domain, connected by a long interdomain helix, and constitute a catalytically active dimer by\nreciprocal domain sharing [13–19].\nIn our recent study we examined several IREDs for their capability of reducing sulfur-containing\nheterocyclic imines, mainly diﬀerent 3-thiazolines and 2H-1,4-benzothiazines. Out of all the IREDs\nwe tested, the S-enantioselective IRED from Mycobacterium smegmatis (S-IRED-Ms), a member of the\nIRED superfamily 3 (SFam3) ﬁrst characterized by Wetzl et al. in 2015 [20,21], proved to be the only\none capable of reducing both 3-thiazolines and 2H-1,4-benzothiazines with promising activity and\nexcellent enantioselectivity [22].\nWith the prospect of using IREDs as a broadly applicable reduction platform for heterocyclic imines\nin general, substrate promiscuity with retained enantioselectivity is a desirable property, but for further\noptimization of the system a deeper understanding of the underlying structural factors inﬂuencing\nsubstrate speciﬁcity and enantioselectivity is necessary. In order to further elucidate this, we present a\nhigh-resolution crystal structure of S-IRED-Ms together with its cofactor NADPH, the ﬁrst published\nstructure of an SFam3 IRED.\n2. Materials and Methods\n2.1. Expression of S-IRED-Ms\nThe imine reductase fromMycobacterium smegmatis (S-IRED-Ms) was expressed inE. coli BL21(DE3)\naccording to a literature-known procedure [ 21,22]. A preculture of E. coli BL21(DE3) carrying the\nrecombinant plasmid with the gene coding for S-IRED-Ms was cultivated overnight at 37 ◦C in 10 mL\nlysogeny broth (LB) medium containing 100 µg/mL carbenicillin. The main culture (6 times 300 mL\nautoinduction (AI) medium containing 100 µg/mL carbenicillin) was inoculated with the preculture to\na ﬁnal concentration of 1% and cultures were incubated for 2 h at 37◦C and 180 rpm, and afterwards at\n15 ◦C and 180 rpm for 60–70 h. The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000×g and 4 ◦C for 30 min\nand then resuspended in 3 mL 50 mM KP i pH 7.0 containing 20 mM imidazole and 300 mM NaCl\nper gram of wet cell weight. Cell disruption was performed by homogenisation with the homogenizer\nEmulsiFlex-C5 (Avestin, Ottawa, Canada) at a pressure of 1000–1500 bar in 3 cycles and the crude\nextract was obtained as supernatant after centrifugation at 20,000×g and 4 ◦C for 30 min.\n2.2. Protein Puriﬁcation\nNickel-nitriloacetic acid (Ni-NTA) aﬃnity chromatography was performed as ﬁrst puriﬁcation\nstep. The gravity ﬂow column was packed with Ni-NTA (6–7 mL), washed with 25 mL of Milli-Q ®\nwater (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) and then equilibrated with 25 mL of washing buﬀer I (50 mM\nKPi pH 7.0, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole). Crude cell extract (up to 20 mL) was loaded onto the\ncolumn, resuspended with the column material and incubated for 5 min. The column was washed\nBiomolecules 2020, 10, 1130 3 of 13\nwith 25 mL of washing bu ﬀer I and then 50 mL of washing bu ﬀer II (50 mM KP i pH 7.0, 300 mM\nNaCl, 40 mM imidazole). The S-IRED-Ms was eluted with 10 mL of elution buﬀer (50 mM KPi pH 7.0,\n300 mM NaCl, 300 mM imidazole). The elution fraction was concentrated to a volume of 2.5 mL using\na Vivaspin ultraﬁltration column with a molecular weight cut-oﬀ of 20 kDa. Desalting was performed\nwith PD-10 columns (GE Healthcare, Berlin, Germany) equilibrated with 50 mM KPi pH 7.0 according\nto the manufacturer’s instructions.\nAnion-exchange chromatography using the HiLoad 26/10 Q-Sepharose High Performance column\nand the ÄKTA ™ system (GE Healthcare) was performed with 50 mM KPi pH 7.0 and a salt gradient of\n0 to 1 M NaCl over 10 column volumes.\nSize exclusion chromatography was performed with 10 mM HEPES pH 7.0 using the Superdex\n200 Increase 10/300 GL column and the ÄKTA ™ system (GE Healthcare). The S-IRED-Ms fraction was\nconcentrated using a Vivaspin ultraﬁltration column (Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany) with a molecular\nweight cut-oﬀ of 20 kDa. The concentration of the puriﬁed enzyme ( ε= 19,480 M−1 cm−1) was\ndetermined spectrophotometrically and the success of the puriﬁcation over the three steps was checked\nby SDS-PAGE (Figure S9). The homogeneity of the puriﬁed protein was assessed and veriﬁed by mass\nspectrometry, withm/z calculated for S-IRED-Ms to be [M]+: 30,996.81 and found to be 30,996.94.\n2.3. Protein Crystallization\nApo-S-IRED-Ms as well as holo-S-IRED-Ms with 5 mM of either NADP+ or NADPH were mixed\nwith 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM iodoacetamide for protease inhibition, centrifuged for 30 min at 31,500×g\nand then subjected to broad crystallization trials using a range of commercially available screens.\nNo crystals were obtained for apo-S-IRED-Ms. Initial holo-S-IRED-Ms crystals grew with NADPH\nat a protein concentration of 10 mg/mL in an optimized crystallization condition A8 of the JCSG+ suite\nby QIAGEN (0.2 M sodium formate, 20% (w/v) PEG 3350) in a sitting drop setup with 200 nL protein\nand 100 nL reservoir solution at 4 ◦C. Larger crystals for diﬀraction experiments were obtained after\none week at the same protein concentration and temperature in an optimized sitting drop setup with\n2 µL protein and 1 µL reservoir solution consisting of 20% (w/v) PEG 3350 and 0.2 M sodium formate.\nCrystals were cryoprotected in modiﬁed reservoir solution containing 22 % ( w/v) PEG 3350, 0.2 M\nsodium formate and 20% glycerol and ﬂash-frozen in liquid nitrogen.\nCo-crystallization of holo- S-IRED-Ms with 5–25 mM of various substrates diluted in DMSO\n(end-concentration 5%) (Table S1) yielded crystals in a wide variety of conditions at 4◦C in a sitting\ndrop setup with 200 nL protein and 100 nL reservoir solution, both with NADP + as well as with\nNADPH. While co-crystallization with NADPH tended to produce larger, more regularly shaped\ncrystals faster, NADP+-containing crystals were generally of equal diﬀraction quality.\nCrystals for anomalous data collection were grown at a protein concentration of 10 mg/mL with\n5 mM NADP+ and either 5 mM 3-TZ in crystallization condition F5 of the high molecular weight\nmix PEG smear screen (as described in [23]) or 5 mM BT in crystallization condition H8 of the JCSG+\nsuite (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) (0.2 M sodium chloride, 0.1 M Bis-Tris pH 5.5, 25 % ( w/v) PEG\n3350). Crystals were cryoprotected in reservoir solution containing 10 % (v/v) PEG and ﬂash-frozen in\nliquid nitrogen.\n2.4. Data Collection, Processing and Structure Determination\nThe native synchrotron MX data for holo-S-IRED-Ms with NADPH were collected at beamline\nP13 operated by EMBL Hamburg at the PETRA III storage ring (DESY, Hamburg, Germany) [ 24].\nThe data were indexed and integrated with the XDS package and scaled to a cut-oﬀ resolution of 1.55 Å\nwith AIMLESS from the CCP4 package [25–27]. The structure was solved by molecular replacement\nwith Phaser and improved with Phenix Autobuild [28,29]. First, based on solvent content analysis,\nﬁve copies of an ensemble of the Rossmann fold containing domain of three homologous IREDs\n(Protein Data Bank (PDB) IDs: 5G6R [17], 3ZGY [13], 4D3S [15]) were placed. Then, two copies of an\nensemble of theα-helical domain of three homologous IREDS (PDB IDs: 5G6R, 3ZGY, 4OQY [14]) could\nBiomolecules 2020, 10, 1130 4 of 13\nbe placed sequentially. The three remaining copies of the α-helical domain were placed manually by\nsuperposition onto symmetry mates. After rigid body and restrained reﬁnement with phenix.reﬁne [30],\nthe electron density was deﬁned well enough for rebuilding the model in place with the correct amino\nacid sequence with Phenix AutoBuild [29], greatly improving the free R-factor by 15 % in the process.\nSubsequently, ﬁve copies of NADPH could be placed in the resulting Fo-Fc diﬀerence density with\nPhenix LigandFit [ 31]. Several rounds of rebuilding and structure validation were performed in\nCoot [32], followed by rigid body-, coordinate-, TLS-, occupancy- and individual B-factor-reﬁnements\nin phenix.reﬁne and Refmac5 [33].\nAnomalous diﬀraction data for holo-S-IRED-Ms with NADPH and either 3-TZ or BT were collected\nat an energy of roughly 6 keV (wavelengths of 1.9074 Å to 2.0664 Å) on beamline BL14.2 at the BESSY II\nelectron storage ring operated by the Helmholtz-Zentrum Berlin [34], indexed and integrated with the\nXDS package and scaled with AIMLESS to a cut-oﬀ resolution of 2.14 Å for the 3-TZ dataset and 2.40 Å\nwith for the BT dataset. The structures were solved by molecular replacement with Phaser, using one\nmonomer from the previously solved S-IRED-Ms but without the cofactor NADPH as the initial search\nmodel (PDB ID: 6SMT). Cofactor placement, model completion, validation and reﬁnement were per\nperformed analogously to the native dataset. Data collection and reﬁnement statistics are reported in\nTable 1.

Monomer B is colored in light orange.\nThe cofactor NADPH is depicted as stick model in gray.\nThe model is of high quality (Table 1) and is mostly complete with the only poor density regions\nnot modeled being the N-terminal methionine, hexahistidine-tag and one (A, B, E) or two (C, D)\nthreonines and the last one (B) to four (A, C-E) amino acids of the C-terminus.\nThe S-IRED-Ms monomer, represented by subunit A, consists of an N-terminal Rossmann-fold\ndomain of 160 amino acids (9–169) and a C-terminal helical domain (201–294) connected by a long\ninterdomain helix (170–200). The N-terminal domain consists of a mixed eight-stranded β-sheet\ninterspersed in sequence and encapsulated by six α-helices. The C-terminal domain is comprised of\nthe end of the interconnecting helix and a further four helices (Figure 1 and Figure S1). The dimers are\nBiomolecules 2020, 10, 1130 6 of 13\ngenerated by reciprocal domain swapping, where the end of N-terminal domain A, the interdomain\nhelix α7 protrudes and inserts through a hydrophobic channel in the C-terminal domain of chain B\n(Figure S2) to then emerge and continue as the C-terminal helical domain of A, which contacts the\nN-terminal domain of subunit B.\nSurface-exposed reciprocal salt bridges between R165 (chain A, helix α7) and E200 (chain B,\nhelix α8) at the N-terminal side and between D96 (chain A, loop connecting strand β5 and helix α5)\nand H244 (chain B, helix α9) as well as a buried salt bridge between D175 (chain A, helix α7) and H186\n(chain B, helix α7) at the C-terminal side of the interdomain helix further stabilize the dimer (Figure S3),\nresulting in a large contact area of 4076 Å 2 on average per monomer, calculated with the ‘protein\ninterfaces, surfaces and assemblies’ service PISA (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/prot_int/pistart.html) [35].\n3.2. NADPH-Binding Site\nThe cleft formed between the Rossmann-fold domain of subunit A and the helical domain of\nsubunit B constitutes the active site of S-IRED-Ms and is a large channel at the dimer interface with\ntwo separate openings, presumably for individual binding of NADPH and a substrate, respectively.\nThe electron density obtained after molecular replacement allowed for unequivocal placement of ﬁve\nNADPH molecules in the asymmetric unit, one in each S-IRED-Ms monomer active site.

The 3′-ribose hydroxyl of the nicotinamide nucleotide\ninteracts with the backbone of S95, V68 and V69, while its 5′-phosphate contacts the peptidic NH of\nM15 (Figure 2a). The nicotinamide ring is held in place by interactions with S232 and stacks against M15\nwith its si-face presented to the presumed substrate-binding area of the active site. The characteristic\nGXGXXG consensus sequence for NADPH binding is present as G(11)LGPMG(16) [36].\nCalculation of the electrostatic surface potential with the APBS [37] Tool 2.1 plugin in PyMOL\nrevealed that while some of the residues that bind the adenosine moiety of NADPH and its\n2′-phosphorylated ribose are positively charged and the cofactor binding site displays a positive\nelectrostatic surface potential, an overwhelmingly negative potential can be observed in the rest of the\nchannel after the diphosphates leading to the substrate binding site and in the site (Figure 2b).\n3.3. Substrate-Binding Site\nThe second entrance to the active site in S-IRED-Ms, situated between the loop connecting the\nβ-strands β6 and β7 of one S-IRED-Ms monomer and the loop connecting α-helices α8 and α9 as well\nas helix α8 itself of the other monomer is characterized by a strongly negative electrostatic surface\npotential, largely due to D125, E218 and possibly to a lesser extent P214 and S232 outlining the entrance\n(Figure 3a).\nInterestingly, diﬀraction quality crystals could only be obtained with cofactor present in the\ncrystallization cocktail. We observed positive di ﬀerence electron density inside the active site of\nthe enzyme at a position equivalent to that of substrate molecules in other IRED structures in the\nliterature [16–19], which was of a similar shape in all the crystal structures we obtained, independent\nof whether we used NADPH or NADP+, which substrate or cryoprotectants we used or if we utilized\nsoaking or co-crystallization methods (Figure S4).\nBiomolecules 2020, 10, 1130 7 of 13\nBiomolecules 2020, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 12 \n \nof chain B (Figure S2) to then emerge and continue as the C-terminal helical domain of A, which \ncontacts the N-terminal domain of subunit B. \nSurface-exposed reciprocal salt bridges between R165 (chain A, helix α7) and E200 (chain B, helix \nα8) at the N-terminal side and between D96 (chain A, loop connecting strand β5 and helix α5) and \nH244 (chain B, helix α9) as well as a buried salt bridge between D175 (chain A, helix α7) and H186 \n(chain B, helix α7) at the C-terminal side of the interdomain helix further stabilize the dimer (Figure \nS3), resulting in a large contact area of 4076 Å² on average per monomer, calculated with the ‘protein \ninterfaces, surfaces and assemblies’ service PISA  (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/prot_int/pistart.html) \n[35]. \n3.2.

The best ﬁt was achieved with\nplacement of a 2-ethylhexanol (2-EH) molecule, but we do not imply this to be an actual substrate of\nthe enzyme. The origin of this component is unclear, but it is known to be a precursor for the synthesis\nand also degradation product of the wide-spread plasticizer DEHP [38]. Most known IREDs contain\neither a tyrosine or an aspartic acid in a conserved position at the top of the site that is demonstrated to\nplay an essential role in catalysis [17,19,20]. The corresponding D170 in S-IRED-Ms is located 6–7 Å\naway from the apparent substrate position and this distance is bridged via two water molecules at\ndistances of roughly 2.7 Å and 4.9 Å in between. In addition, subfamily-speciﬁc, highly conserved\nresidues presumably mediating stereopreference have been identiﬁed in the past [20]. In S-IRED-Ms,\nthe corresponding residues M121, P123, L174 and F177 are all present within 5 Å of the active site\nsubstrate surrogate 2-EH and oriented towards it. Other residues also within 5 Å of the presumed\nsubstrate position include I120, T122, W178, I208, I211, I215, A233, GE278 and I279 (Figure 3b).\nBiomolecules 2020, 10, 1130 8 of 13\nBiomolecules 2020, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 12 \n \nFigure 2.

Second entrance and active site of S-IRED-Ms. ( a) The opening to the active site cavity\nshows a negative electrostatic potential. This is largely due to D125, E218 and possibly P214 and\nS232 outlining the entrance. ( b) 2-ethylhexanol (2-EH) was modelled into the active site. 2-EH is\nsandwiched by hydrophobic residues like P123, L174, F177, and W178 and also forms two hydrogen\nbonds to nearby waters which are part of a wider network inside the active site, further holding 2-EH\nin place. Amino acids within 5 Å of 2-EH as well as D170 in the proposed protic position are depicted\nas sticks, with the two chains forming the dimer colored in light orange and marine blue. NADPH is\ncolored in light gray. The 2Fo-Fc electron density of NADPH, contoured at 1 σ, is shown in dark gray.\nThe hydrogen bonds of the 2-EH hydroxyl to nearby water molecules (red spheres) are indicated as\npink dashed lines.\nIn some of the datasets we collected from crystals with substrate present in the crystallization\ncocktails, 2-EH did not seem to fully explain the density observed in the active site. We therefore\ngenerated polder maps and composite omit maps to reduce the inﬂuence of bulk solvent in phenix,\nbut no substantial improvement of the density could be achieved (Figures S5 and S6) [ 30,39,40].\nWe then collected anomalous data of these 2,2,3-trimethyl-1-thia-4-azaspiro[4.4]non-3-ene (3-TZ)-\nand 2,2,3-trimethyl-2H-1,4-benzothiazine (BT)-crystals at an energy of roughly 6 keV to visualize\nphosphorus and sulfur atoms in order to verify whether the sulfur-containing ligands could be\npresent with partial occupancy or in diﬀerent orientations due to the size of the active site. While the\nBiomolecules 2020, 10, 1130 9 of 13\nmethionine-sulfurs and NADPH-phosphates were clearly visible, no clear sulfur-signal could be\ndetected in the active site cavity itself, thereby conﬁrming the absence of the sulfur-containing\nsubstrates (Supplementary Figure S7).\nOther groups in the ﬁeld previously described the related enzymes AoIRED, BcIRED and\nAspRedAm switching to a closed conformation upon cofactor binding, characterized by a relative\nangle-closure between the N-terminal Rossmann- and the C-terminal helical domain and by a loop\nrestricting access to the NADPH-binding site in their respective crystal structures [15–17], while others\ndid not observe such movements [13]. Since we did not obtain crystals of apo-S-IRED-Ms, no direct\ncomparison between the former and the cofactor-bound holo-S-IRED-Ms can be drawn. The state that\nholo-S-IRED-Ms was crystallized in could be best described a closed state, resembling the closed state\nfound in AspRedAm (PDB ID: 5G6S), the reductive aminase most similar toS-IRED-Ms according to the\nDALI-Server (http://ekhidna2.biocenter.helsinki.ﬁ/dali) [41], which has a root mean square deviation\n(r.m.s.d.) to S-IRED-Ms of 1.3 Å in its closed form and 1.6–1.9 Å in its open form (Figure S8 and\nTable S2).\n4. Discussion\nIn the last ten years, IREDs have become a promising target for the development of a\nbiocatalytic approach to the enantioselective generation of chiral amines via asymmetric reduction of\nprochiral imines.\nIREDs are structurally closely related to the family of β-hydroxy acid dehydrogenases (β-HADs)\nand with NADPH also being the essential cofactor for both [ 20], it was assumed they also share a\nsimilar reaction mechanism where NADPH acts as a hydride donor while a protic amino acid, in most\nIREDs either tyrosine or aspartic acid, would act as a proton donor [13].\nHence, two mechanisms have been discussed in the past di ﬀering in the sequence of events.\nIn Irp3, a thiazolinyl imine reductase from Yersinia enterocolitica, the hydride transfer occurs ﬁrst,\nfollowed by protonation via a general acid residue [42]. However, it has to be taken into account that\nthe C=N double bond of such substrates is embedded into a imido thioester subunit, which means\nthat this C=N double bond is more strongly activated compared to the C=N bond of “typical” imines\n(Schiﬀ bases) such as the one in the 3-thiazoline considered in this study.\nHowever, the necessity of a proton donor amino acid in IREDs has remained ambiguous to this day.\nMutational studies revealed that substitution for a non-protic residue like alanine in this position can in\nsome IREDs lead to retained albeit lower enzymatic activity [12,43]. In addition, a wild-type IRED from\nPseudomonas putida with alanine in this position has been described [44], suggesting either the existence\nof additional contributing factors in the protonation process or an altogether diﬀerent mechanism.\nThe second proposed mechanism is based on dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Here, the substrate\nis protonated by water and the hydride transfer occurs afterwards, completing the reduction [ 45].\nIt has thus been speculated that IREDs do not use this position for proton donation but rather for\nanchoring and positioning substrate in an optimal orientation and distance to the cofactor NADPH,\nsince they might operate at a pH value where the substrate is already presented as a protonated\niminium species [ 19]. This ﬁts well with our observations, that in most IREDs in general and in\nS-IRED-Ms in particular the electrostatic potential of the active site as well as of the second entrance\nto it is negative, which could therefore act in a gatekeeping manner favoring the entry of positively\ncharged molecules.\nPrevious ﬁndings indicated that several conserved hydrophobic residues on the sides of the active\nsite and not the one in the general acid position are responsible for the enzymes’ enantioselectivity.\nThis is supported by the fact that the S-enantioselective S-IRED-Ms, an SFam3 IRED, shares the\naspartic acid in the general acid position with IREDs from SFam1, which are R-selective, while the\naforementioned conserved hydrophobic residues are shared with SFam2 IREDs, which are also\nS-selective like S-IRED-Ms but diﬀer in their general acid residue [20].\nBiomolecules 2020, 10, 1130 10 of 13\nHowever, the high substrate promiscuity of these enzymes paired with di ﬀerent substrate\nspeciﬁcities of IREDs within the same subfamily remains enigmatic. In our previous study, we tested\nfour other SFam3 IREDs in addition to S-IRED-Ms, and while sequence alignments reveal that residues\naround 5 Å of the substrate in the active site seem to be conserved (Figure S1), these IREDs demonstrated\nnext to no activity on the substrates thatS-IRED-Ms converted readily [22], again indicating the presence\nof a potential gatekeeping mechanism limiting access to the active site.\nHowever, only a few of the hundreds of known IREDs have been structurally described, and it\nis possible that interactions not yet observed or considered are responsible for IRED reduction\ncharacteristics. To fully understand the catalytic mechanism and its underlying principles, it will\nthus be imperative to obtain more structural data with substrates in place, preferably of other SFam3\nIREDs. The apparently complex interactions controlling the processes in the active site, the substrate\npromiscuity and lack of knowledge with regard to endogenous substrates of IREDs complicate this\nendeavor. Therefore, it might be necessary to stabilize the transitional state in which the substrate\nis bound to the enzyme in a protonated state and to inhibit the enzyme’s capability to complete the\nreduction mechanism in order to limit dissolution of the S-IRED-Ms-substrate complex and stabilize it\nfor crystallization. This could potentially be achieved by utilizing positively charged iminium ions\nwhich have been demonstrated to be valid substrates before and redox-inactive cofactor analogues\nlike NADPH 4 which has been used to crystallize the closely related AtRedAm with a synthetic\nsubstrate [18,43]. Another, albeit more complex strategy to understand the role and mechanism of\nIREDs could involve identifying their respective endogenous substrates via untargeted and combination\nmetabolomics approaches [46,47].\nSupplementary Materials: The following are available online at http://www.mdpi.com/2218-273X/10/8/1130/s1;\nFigure S1, Sequence alignment of S-IRED-Ms and other SFam3-type IREDs; Figure S2, The interdomain helix;\nFigure S3, Salt bridges stabilizing S-IRED-Ms; Figure S4, Similar electron density in the active site of various\nS-IRED-Ms crystals; Figure S5, Polder density in the active site of various S-IRED-Ms crystals; Figure S6, Electron\ndensity in the active site of various S-IRED-Ms crystals after substrate placement; Figure S7, 2Fo-Fc, Fo-Fc and\nanomalous diﬀerence density of an S-IRED-Ms crystal; Figure S8, Comparison of the open and closed state of\nAspRedAm to S-IRED-Ms; Figure S9, SDS-PAGE of all puriﬁcation steps of S-IRED-Ms; Table S1, List of substrates\nused for crystallization experiments with S-IRED-Ms in this study [48–51]; Table S2, List of the ten chains in the\nPDB most similar to S-IRED-Ms according to the DALI-Server; [41].\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, N.Z. and H.H.N.; validation, T.M.; formal analysis, T.M.; investigation,\nT.M., N.Z. and C.G.; resources, H.H.N. and H.G.; writing—original draft preparation, T.M. and N.Z.;\nwriting—review and editing, H.H.N., T.M, N.Z. and H.G.; visualization, T.M.; supervision, H.H.N. and H.G.;\nproject administration, H.H.N.; funding acquisition, H.G.

{"text": "Biocatalysis\nAsymmetric Synthesis ofN-Substituted a-Amino Esters from\na-Ketoesters via Imine Reductase-Catalyzed Reductive Amination\nPeiyuan Yao+, James R. Marshall+, Zefei Xu, Jesmine Lim, Simon J. Charnock, Dunming Zhu,*\nand Nicholas J. Turner*\nAbstract: N-Substituted a-amino esters are widely used as\nchiral intermediates in a range of pharmaceuticals. Here we\nreport the enantioselective biocatalyic synthesis of N-substi-\ntuted a-amino esters through the direct reductive coupling ofa-\nketoesters and amines employing sequence diverse metage-\nnomic imine reductases (IREDs). Both enantiomers of N-\nsubstituted a-amino esters were obtained with high conversion\nand excellent enantioselectivity under mild reaction conditions.\nIn addition >20 different preparative scale transformations\nwere performed highlighting the scalability of this system.\nN-Substituted a-amino acids and their derivatives have\nattracted increasing attention in the pharmaceutical and fine\nchemical industries in recent years, forming the key scaffolds\nin a number of bioactive molecules (Figure 1).\n[1] For example,\nN-methylated analogues of peptides and peptidomimetics can\nimprove the pharmacokinetic properties of such molecules,\nincluding metabolic stability, membrane permeability, and\noral bioavailability.\n[2] Although tremendous efforts have been\ndevoted to the preparation of N-alkyl-a-amino acids, [1a,3]\nincluding bio-inspired asymmetric reductive aminations, [4]\nthere are a number of limitations to these synthetic methods.\nThe N-alkylation process often requires genotoxic alkylating\nagents, such as alkyl halides,[3a] and can be impractical on large\nscale due to difficulty in removing specific protecting\ngroups.[5] Biomimetic routes also have their constraints due\nto the need to preform the imine and the employment of\ntransition metals such as ruthenium.\n[4,6]\nAs a more sustainable and alternative approach to\nchemical methods, biocatalysis has become an attractive\noption in preparing chiral N-substituted a-amino acids or\ntheir derivatives. [1] Current approaches include N-methyla-\ntion of amino acids and peptides by N-methyltransferases,[7]\nsynthesis of N-arylated aspartic acids catalyzed by ethyl-\nenediamine-N,N’-disuccinic acid lyase, [8] and reductive ami-\nnation of a-ketoacids by NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreduc-\ntases including opine dehydrogenases (OpDHs), ketimine\nreductases and N-methyl amino acid dehydrogenases, [9] and\nengineered heme-dependent proteins. [10] However, the cur-\nrent enzymatic toolbox for the synthesis of N-substituted a-\namino acids has several limitations including strict stereose-\nlectivity for formation of the l-(S)-enantiomer. Many enzyme\nfamilies have narrow substrate specificities, with respect to\neither the a-ketoacid or amine partner, with high activities\nlimited to simple primary amines such as methylamine.\nFurthermore, with the exception of a single patent reporting\nreductive aminations employing OpDHs, limited information\nis available regarding stereoselectivities and activities.\n[11]\nThus, methods for the asymmetric synthesis of N-substituted\na-amino acids, or their derivatives, to access both enantio-\nmeric series across a broad range of substrates, remain\na significant challenge.\nImine reductases (IREDs) and reductive aminases\n(RedAms) belong to a family of NAD(P)H-dependent\noxidoreductases which have been utilised in the synthesis of\nchiral amines employing both reductive amination and cyclic\nimine reduction reactions.\n[12] Reductive amination, employing\nwild-type IRED biocatalysts, has helped to define the\nsubstrate scope across both carbonyl acceptors and amine\nFigure 1.

{"text": "partners (primary, and secondary amines). [13] Recently, a large\nmetagenomic (384 enzymes) IRED panel was generated and\napplied to the reductive coupling of b-ketoesters to generate\nenantiocomplementary N-substituted b-amino esters on\npreparative scales.\n[14] Furthermore, the synthetic utility of\nthis enzyme class was recently highlighted on a kilogram scale\nusing an engineered IRED for the synthesis of a lysine-\nspecific demethylase-1 (LSD1) inhibitor, GSK2879552.\n[13a]\nWe therefore sought to evaluate the wild-type metage-\nnomic IRED panel [14] for the reductive amination of aliphatic\nand aromatic a-ketoesters, using various amine partners, to\nassess both the level of conversion and enantioselectivities, in\norder to extend the IRED catalysed reductive amination\nscope to this class of compounds.\nPrevious reports had demonstrated the ability of meta-\ngenomic IREDs and RedAms to accept g- and b-ketoesters\nfor reductive aminations.\n[13e,14] However, with a-ketoacids,\nspecifically pyruvic acid, low activities were observed towards\nthis substrate using the reductive aminase from Aspergillus\noryzae (AspRedAm).[13e] A genetically engineered Coryne-\nbacterium glutamicum strain, expressing an imine reducing\nenzyme of a different oxidoreductase family to the metage-\nnomic IREDs, belonging to Delta(1)-pyrroline-2-carboxylate/\nDelta(1)-piperideine-2-carboxylate reductase ( DpkA) was\nshown to transform pyruvate to N-methyl-l-alanine.\n[15]\nHence exploring additional IRED and RedAm sequence\nspace was of interest to see if we could obtain greater\nactivities with a-ketoester substrates.\nThe panel of 384 IREDs (cell-free extracts) was initially\nscreened for the reductive amination of model substrate ethyl\n2-oxo-4-phenylbutyrate ( 1,2 5 m m) with propargylamine ( a,\n50 mm) in a 100 mL reaction volume. This initial screen\nrevealed that 99 out of the 384 different IREDs (as shown in\nSupplementary Table S3) were found to catalyse the desired\ntransformation. Further analysis revealed that 78 of these\nIREDs were R-selective (of which 35 IREDs exhibited\nexcellent stereoselectivity with ee >99%), while 20 were\nfound to be S-selective where only pIR-338 showed both\nexcellent conversion and selectivity, and one IRED generated\nracemic 1a. The top 5 S-selective and top 7 R-selective\nenzymes, with relative activities for the generation of 1a,\nare shown in Table 1. These 12 enzymes were subsequently\nselected for further reductive amination reactions with\na broader range of a-ketoesters.\nInitially the 12 IREDs were evaluated across a variety of\naryl and alkyl a-ketoesters ( 2–11) ([S] =50 mm) with prop-\nargylamine (a) selected as the amine donor ([S] =100 mm)o n\nan analytical scale. All ketoester substrates except 10 and 11\nwere transformed to the corresponding N-propargyl amino\nesters with moderate to high conversion, high stereoselectiv-\nity, and with complementary enantiopreference (Figure 2 and\nSupplementary Table S4); larger substituents, such as benzyl\nand pentyl groups, were tolerated well. Interestingly, the\nstereoselectivities of enzymes such as pIR-117 and pIR-258\nwere inverted when challenged with different a-ketoesters.\nFor example, both IREDs generated ( R)-2a with a benzyl\nsubstituent at the b-position with >99% ee. However, when\nthis substituent was modified to a methyl group, both enzymes\ngenerated ( S)-3a with 97% ee for pIR-117 and 94% ee for\npIR-258. This inversion of stereoselectivity is not uncommon\nwithin this enzyme family and has been previously\nobserved.\n[16]\nThe scope of the selected 12 IREDs was further evaluated\nwith a variety of amine partners (Table 2) where analytical\nscale biotransformations with 1 (50 mm) and amines a, d, e,\nand g (100 mm) and amines b, c, f (500 mm) were performed.\nFunctionalised amines were selected including propargyl-\namine ( a), allylamine ( d) and 4-methylbenzylamine ( g), as\nwell as linear amines (propylamine ( c)) and cyclic amines\n(cyclopropylamine ( e)). As highlighted in Table 2, pIR-23,\npIR-271, pIR-325, and pIR-338 exhibited excellent stereose-\nlectivity towards a–e, whilst again the enantioselectivities of\nsome IREDs varied depending on the amine partner pre-\nsented. The stereoselectivity of pIR-355 was inverted to\nafford the R-enantiomers with amines methylamine ( b) and\nallylamine ( d) to generate ( R)-1b and ( R)-1d respectively.\nOnly pIR-23 showed activity towards 1 and g with 82%\nconversion and 99% ee (R), but no activity was observed for\ncyclopentylamine ( f).\nTable 1: Conversion and enantioselectivity of the top 12 selected IREDs\nout of 384 enzymes towards reductive amination between ethyl 2-oxo-4-\nphenylbutyrate ( 1) and propargylamine ( a).\n[a] (S)-1a given in green and\n(R)-1a given in blue.\n[a] Reaction conditions: 25 m m ethyl 2-oxo-4-phenylbutyrate ( 1), prop-\nargylamine ( a,5 0m m), 5 mgmL /C01 lysate of E. coliexpressing IRED,\n6U m L/C01 CDX-901 glucose dehydrogenase (GDH), 0.4 m m NADP+,\n62.5 mm glucose, 10% (v/v) DMSO, sodium phosphate buffer (100 m m,\npH 7.5), 100 mL reaction volume, 30 8C, 200 rpm, 20 h.

Angewandte Chemie International Edition published by Wiley-VCH GmbH Angew. Chem. Int. Ed.2021, 60, 8717 –8721\nTo demonstrate the synthetic practicality of this biocat-\nalytic approach, a series of preparative scale reactions was\nperformed on a 2.5 mmol scale in a total reaction volume of\n50 mL (Figure 3). For all of these preparative reactions, good\nto excellent conversions were observed (53–99%), and the\nproducts were isolated as their HCl salts in moderate to high\nyields (27–80%) with excellent ee values for R-selective\nIREDs (98–99%) and good to excellent ee values for S-\nselective IREDs (26–99%). With allylamine ( d) as the amine\npartner, employing metagenomic IRED pIR-271, ( R)-1d was\nsynthesised in 58% isolated yield with excellent enantiose-\nlectivity ( >99%), with this enzyme also being employed on\npreparative scale to ascertain 13 out of a possible 14 ( R)-\nproducts (Figure 3). To highlight the robustness of these\nenzymes towards the preparation of 1a, we obtained space\ntime yields up to 6.6 gL\n/C01 d/C01 with pIR-271. Employing\npurified IR-338 for the preparation of 1a we obtained total\nturnover numbers (TTN) of 3500 with a turnover frequency\n(TOF) of 24 min\n/C01. Conversion to 1a was monitored over\n24 hours with pIR-271 (Figure S96), where nearly full con-\nversion was reached after 2.5 hours of reaction time. Owing to\nthe competing ketone reduction catalysed by endogenous\nE. coliketoreductase activity, lower isolated yields of ( S)-1c,\n(S)-1d,( R)-2a, and ( S)-2a were obtained.\n[17] This was further\ninvestigated with purified pIR-338 for the preparation of 1a\nas shown in Supporting Information Table S5. The origin of\nthis ketoreductase activity appears to be either directly the\nCDX-901, or the lysate from which the GDH is formulated, [18]\nas purified pIR-338 demonstrated no ketoreductase acitvity.\nIn summary, we have developed a highly efficient\nbiocatalytic strategy for the synthesis of N-substituted\namino esters from a-ketoesters and amines catalysed by\nIREDs. This approach offers efficient access to various\nenantiomerically pure N-substituted amino esters from aryl\nand alkyl substituted a-ketoesters with exquisite and com-\nplementary enantioselectivities, addressing problems identi-\nfied in previous chemocatalytic and biocatalytic approaches\nto attain these compounds. The synthetic utility and scal-\nability of this system was highlighted through 28 preparative\nscale transformations. This study continues to emphasise the\nFigure 2.

Here, we show the application of direct infusion of biotransformations\nto the mass spectrometer (DiBT-MS) screening to a variety of enzymes, in\ndiﬀerent formats, achieving sample throughputs equivalent to∼40 s per\nsample. The heat map output allows rapid selection of active enzymes\nwithin 96-well plates facilitating identi ﬁcation of industrially relevant\nbiocatalysts. This DiBT-MS screening workﬂow has been applied to the\ndirected evolution of a phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) as a case study,\nenhancing its activity toward electron-rich cinnamic acid derivatives which\nare relevant to lignocellulosic biomass degradation. Additional beneﬁts of the screening platform include the discovery of biocatalysts\n(kinases, imine reductases) with novel activities and the incorporation of ion mobility technology for the identiﬁcation of product\nhits with increased conﬁdence.\nKEYWORDS: mass spectrometry, desorption electrospray ionization, high-throughput screening, biotransformation, enzyme evolution,\nbiocatalysis\n■ INTRODUCTION\nBiocatalysis provides an alternative and increasingly attractive\nsustainable pathway for the production of high-value chemical\nbuilding blocks and intermediates. However, the application of\nbiocatalysts in chemical synthesis is limited when using\nnaturally occurring enzymes because of narrow substrate\ntolerance, low activity, and poor operational stability. During\nthe past 10 years, advances in protein engineering and directed\nevolution have demonstrated that many of these important\nparameters can be altered to position many more biocatalysts\nfor preparative organic synthesis. Despite the increasing use of\ndirected evolution for improving biocatalyst performance, a\nmajor bottleneck remains in the laborious processes required\nfor screening libraries of variant enzymes to identify candidates\nwith improved properties.\n1 The majority ofin vitrotechniques\nthat are available for analyzing enzyme libraries deploy\nchromatographic methods which provide high-quality data\nregarding chemical identity but are not suitable for libraries in\nexcess of 10\n4 enzyme variants.\nApplying desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) MS to\ncrude reaction mixtures permits the analysis of productsin situ2\n(Figure 1 ), which has signi ﬁcant bene ﬁts for monitoring\nbiocatalytic reactions compared to more traditional chromato-\ngraphic MS methods. This approach shortens the analysis time\nand removes the need for much of the solvent. Further, the\nability to correlate the spatial positions of spotted reactions and\ncolonies with products provides a visual reference on the\nidentiﬁed enzyme “hits”, followed by DNA extraction/PCR\nampliﬁcation to determine the sequence.\n3 Coupling the direct\ninfusion of biotransformations to the mass spectrometer\n(DiBT-MS) high throughput screening method, which\nprovides semiquantitative chemical information, to a protein\nengineering strategy accelerates the evolution of enzymes as\ndemonstrated here.\n■ RESULTS\nKinase Screening (Puriﬁed Enzymes)\nSelective phosphorylation of monosaccharides, mediated by\nsugar kinases, is an important reaction to access natural and\nmodiﬁed glycans.

{"text": "GalKs,4 and N-acetylhexosamine kinases, NahKs5) are eﬃcient\nenzymes for the conversion of their natural substrates but\ntolerate only limited modiﬁcations to the structure of the sugar\nalthough homologues can often display a considerably diﬀerent\nsubstrate spectrum.\n6,7 These kinases therefore present\nattractive targets for rapid screening of various substrate/\nenzyme combinations to identify successful phosphorylation\nreactions.\nA panel of 11 diﬀerent wild-type kinases (5 GalKs and 6\nNahKs) were tested against 15 variously substituted deoxy-\nﬂuorinated monosaccharides (1a−1o, Figure S2), in order to\ncompare our DiBT-MS screening protocol against a previously\nreported\n19F-NMR method to determine reaction conver-\nsions.8 The output from this screen (Figure 2a) is an m/z\nselected heat map of the location of the product ion of interest.\nEach reaction mixture is deposited in a grid format (Figure S1)\nwhich provides mass-resolved heat maps allowing easy visual\nidentiﬁcation of enzyme −substrate pairs with high activity\n(brightest colored pixels). Due to the isomeric nature of some\nof the substrates tested in this screen, extracting mass spectral\ndata for a single m/z value (M-1) (2a−2h, Table S1, 261.1\nDa) is suﬃcient to view results from 88 reactions (yellow\npixels). Alternatively, if substrates (and consequently products)\nare diﬀerent in mass (1i−1o, Table S1), multiple m/z values\nmay be selected, and the resulting heat maps can be overlaid to\ngenerate a single, easy to interpret, image (red, green, and blue\npixels). When we compared DiBT-MS heat maps with the\nresults of quantitative\n19F-NMR analysis (Table S2), we found\na semiquantitative correspondence between the two methods\n(Supporting Information, Figures S3 and S4 ,w i t ht h e\ncalculated reaction conversions (%) indicated below the\ncorresponding DiBT-MS spot).\nThe technique is also amenable to other enzyme classes\n(Figure 2b,c) with results discussed below. Optimization of the\nDiBT-MS method gives a screen of superior throughput\ncompared to other analytical techniques (Figure 2d). Further\ninvestigation into quanti ﬁcation gave a good linearity of\nresponse over 1.5 orders of magnitude and sensitivity down to\n5 μM( Figure 3a,b). These limits are in part determined by the\nstage raster speed and pixel size: higher throughput will\ndecrease analyte sensitivity (Figure 3b). The linearity aﬀorded\nfrom summing pixel signal intensities across a sample\ndeposition region gave a high R\n2 value of 0.9983 (obtained\nacross a range from 5 to 100μM, Figure 3a), with saturation\noccurring for this compound (galactose-1-phosphate) above\n∼1m M( Figure S5).\nScreening of Metagenomic Imine Reductases (Cell-Free\nExtract)\nAmong the toolbox of enzymes available for the generation of\nchiral amines, NADPH-dependent imine reductases (IREDs)\nhave emerged as practical and versatile biocatalysts for both\nasymmetric imine reduction and reductive amination.\n9,10\nAccess to these biocatalysts has recently been enhanced by\nexploring metagenomic sequence space to construct the largest\npanel of IREDs available to date.11\nA panel of 384 IREDs was screened for the reduction of\ndehydrosalsolidine 3 (Figure S6). Formation of salsolidine4\nwas observed inm/z selected heat maps where both substrate\nand product ions are shown (Figure 2b, see the Methods\nsection for dimensions and grid preparation). The reverse\nreaction, i.e., oxidation of4 to 3, was also assessed using our\nrecently developed colorimetric screen\n11 with good correlation\nto the DiBT-MS method (Supporting Information,Figure S7).\nFollowing DiBT-MS and colorimetric screening,ﬁve enzymes\nwere selected for analytical biotransformations in the reductive\ndirection (see Table S3 ). All enzymes showed excellent\nconversions (>99%) and excellent enantioselectivities\n(>99%) where metagenomic IREDs aﬀorded both (S)- and\n(R)-4.10\nIncorporation of Ion Mobility\nFrom IRED DiBT-MS screening (Figure 2b and Figure S8),\nthe second 13C isotope m/z of the substrate (major ionm/z\n206.1) ism/z coincident with the major product ion observed\n(m/z 208.1). Since this IRED imine to amine biotransforma-\ntion results in a product only two mass units higher than the\nsubstrate, a low-intensity positive hit was identiﬁed in every\nwell-plate position “beneath” the genuine biotransformation\nresult. To remove these false positives, traveling wave ion\nmobility (TWIMS)\n12,13 was employed to “ﬁlter” the 13C\nisotope from the product ion. Results from such a DiBT-IM-\nMS screen are presented inFigure 3c, in which 5 wells of an\nIRED reaction from a metagenomic plate were analyzed by this\nmethod. Removal is possible as the major product ion (amine)\nand the substrate (imine) present with diﬀering drift times\n(Figure S9). The heat map data obtained without ion mobility\nseparation are shown alongside one another inFigure 3ct o\nillustrate the removal of the underlying false positive.\nFigure 1. Overview of the DiBT-MS work ﬂow for screening\nbiocatalytic reactions and identifying improved enzyme variants.\nInitially, the reactions (whole cell or puriﬁed enzyme) are performed\nwithin Eppendorf tubes or 96/384-well plates (1) before spotting (0.5\nμL) of the quenched reaction onto a nylon membrane grid (see\nphotograph, Figure S1) prepared for DiBT-MS analysis (2). The\nmembrane containing dried spotted reactions is subjected to DiBT-\nMS analysis where necessary with ion mobility (IM) separation (3),\nand the resulting mass- and mobility-resolved heat maps were assessed\nfor wells with the highest product detection (4). The sample\nremaining in the corresponding 96/384-well plate or Eppendorf tube\ncan then be extracted for DNA sequencing to identify the mutations\nresponsible for improved activity (5).\nJACS Au pubs.acs.org/jacsau Article\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/jacsau.1c00027\nJACS Au 2021, 1, 508−516\n509\nPAL Screening and Directed Evolution Case Study (Whole\nCell)\nPhenylalanine ammonia lyases (PALs) catalyze the enantiose-\nlective addition of ammonia to cinnamic acids to yield L-\nphenylalanine derivatives. Currently, the available suite of\nPALs is limited for substrates with multiple electron-donating\nsubstituents on the phenyl ring of both amino acid and acrylic\nacid substrates.\n14,15 As such, we sought to use DiBT-MS to\nidentify PALs able to accept electron-rich cinnamic acid\nderivatives (Figure S10 and Table S4) that are present in\nlignocellulosic biomass degradation (e.g., p-coumaric, ferulic,\nsinapic acid). These phenylalanine derivatives are key building\nblocks for biologically active molecules and active pharma-\nceutical ingredients (APIs) such as the anti-Parkinson drug L-\nDOPA.\n16\nInitially, the activities of a panel of wild-type PALs were\ncompared by HPLC (Table 1, full data set in Table S5),\nincluding enzymes from published sources and metagenomic\norigin, against a broad panel of methoxy-substituted arylacrylic\nacids 5a−5u (Supporting Information, Data Set S1).

(d) Table to show the increase in throughput achieved for three speciﬁc reaction types when\nemploying DiBT-MS as the primary screening technique in comparison to alternative techniques, wherein the longer time denotes discovery, and\nthe shorter time indicates an optimized assay.\nJACS Au pubs.acs.org/jacsau Article\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/jacsau.1c00027\nJACS Au 2021, 1, 508−516\n510\nsimilarly; however, AL-11 showed much greater substrate\nconversions to the amino acid products6a, 6d, 6f, 6g, and6h.\nIt is worth noting that AL-11 revealed low activity with an\nelectron-donating group solely at the para position (5c, 5j)\ncompared to PbPAL.\nMoreover, AL-11 exhibited remarkable activity with di- or\ntrimethoxycinnamic acids (5o−5q, 5s), which are generally\ninactive in the known PAL sequence space.\n18 It is reasonable to\nsuppose that the low activity is due to not only the presence of\nelectron-donating groups but also a complex network of\nstereoelectronic eﬀects which mean that the substituents are\nmore weakly bound in the enzyme active site.\nAlthough the hydroamination reaction does not proceed\nwith naturally occurring lignin monomers such as ferulic acid,\nto our surprise, excellent conversion (92%) and perfect\nenantioselectivity (>99% ee) could be achieved with the\nalkylated 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acid 5o as a substrate, to\ngenerate\nL-veratrylglycine (a key building block for a variety of\nbiologically active molecules such as L-DOPA and anticancer\nagents\n19). Closer inspection of the sequence alignments\nrevealed slight active-site deviation from previously identiﬁed\n“selectivity residues” such as the otherwise conserved amino\nacid residue L90 in PbPAL which corresponds to A80 in AL-\n11. This variation was predicted to allow accommodation of\nthe large m-MeO substituents in the active site of AL-11.\nSimilar evidence was discovered that introducing a leucine to\nalanine point mutation in a related phenylalanine aminomutase\nenzyme fromTaxus canadensis(TcPAM) increased the activity\nof m-Me compounds.\n20\nTo improve the activity of the PAL enzymes witho-MeO\nsubstituents (5m, 5r, 5t), which gave an overall conversion of\n<5%, we performed a blast sequence alignment of AL-11\nagainst previously reported PAL homologues and found highly\nconserved active site residues surrounding the electrophilic\nMIO catalytic ring moiety. An energy-minimized homology\nmodel of AL-11 was constructed from Anabaena variabilis\nAvPAL\n15,21 (PDB: 5LTM) with a 3,4-dimethoxycinnamic acid\n5o ligand docked in the hydrophobic enzyme active site\n(Figure 4a and Figure S11).\nThe ﬁrst engineering approach involved the point mutation\nof the large polar amino acid residue Q84 to smaller\nhydrophobic groups, which widens the substrate cavity in\nclose proximity to thep-substituents that gave rise to variants\nsuch as Q84A, Q84I, and Q84V. The second approach\nFigure 3.(a) Mass-resolved heat map indicating the limit of detection\nof six diﬀerent concentrations of galactose-1-phosphate using a pixel\nsize of 500μm × 500 μm and a rate of 2000μm/s.

Of the variants\ntested under the same condition as WT using the selected test\nsubstrate 5m, the variant Q84V had greater than 7-fold\nconversion (37%) to the unnatural amino acid product. Other\npoint mutations were tested on the amino acid residue H85,\nwhich proved to be overall detrimental to product conversions,\neven abolishing WT activity with all substrates screened\n(Figure 2c and Figure S12).\nIn addition to the Q84V variant and to limit the screening\neﬀorts, we created combinatorial libraries targeting neighbor-\ning active site residues N199, L196, L148, and I400\nsurrounding the cinnamic acid aromatic moiety using a\ndegenerate codon set RBT (coding for the 6 amino acids T,\nS, I, G, A, V). Double mutation libraries were designed and\ngave rise to a total number of 36 possible amino acid\ncombinations; this required screening approximately 106\nclones to achieve 95% coverage.\n24\nDiBT-MS screening of library A (L148RBT/L196RBT)\n(Figure 4b) gave few hits and revealed the crucial importance\nof conserving the L148 amino acid. In accordance with a\nprevious report using PcPAL a large decrease in product\nconversion was shown in o-MeO substituents with the\ncomplementary conserved L206 amino acid residue mutated\nto valine.\n14 By contrast, the mutational changes within the\nL196RBT library gave rise to conversions up to 62% and 70%\nfrom variants L196A and L196T, respectively.\nThe screening of library B (N199RBT/I400RBT) (Figure\n4b) detected hits where point mutations were present at the\nconserved amino acid residue N199. Activity was determined\nwith mutated variants to the smaller hydrophobic side chain\nresidues (G, V, I, T), but the N199V mutation was the most\nprevalent and noticeable in the DiBT-MS screening.\nInterestingly, other homologues in the aromatic ammonia\nlyase family exhibit this corresponding valine amino acid\nresidue.\n22,25 In the same manner, variants of the highly\nconserved I400 residue were not detected presumably due to\nthe critical structural role of this residue in the enzyme active\nsite.\nAfter identifying amino acid hotspots from our two previous\nmutagenic libraries, we sought to recombine L196RBT and\nN199RBT to create library C (Figure 4b) containing the best\npossible combinations. Most hits were detected in library C\nwith the predominantly featured L196T mutation in\ncombination with mutated residue N199I, N199G, or\nN199V which gave >95% conversion of 5m to the\ncorresponding product (Figure 4c). In addition, we further\nexplored trisubstituted cinnamic acids5t and 5u containing the\ndisubstitution motif of 5m against our selected “hits” and\nfound variants that gave >99% conversion to the correspond-\ning\nL-phenylalanine derivatives (Figure S13).\nTo demonstrate the practical applicability of these enzymes,\nwe performed preparative scale biotransformations with the\nbest variants for 7 of the most challenging substrates\nconsidered in the panel ( 5m, 5o−q,a n d 5s−u). The\ncorresponding amino acid products were isolated in pure\nform by adsorption on ion-exchange resin in good isolated\nyields (68−90%) and >97% ee (Supporting Information,Data\nSet S2).\n■ DISCUSSION AND OUTLOOK\nDiBT-MS screening is found to be highly e ﬀective across\ndiﬀerent enzyme classes (kinases, imine reductases, and\nphenylalanine ammonia lyases) presented in diﬀerent formats\n(puriﬁed enzymes, cell-free lysates, and whole cell reactions)\nwith a screening time of 42−50 s per sample (Figure 2d). This\nsuggests that the method will be readily adaptable to many\nmore reaction families, as long as the products are detectable as\nions, and we here discuss this in the context of traditional and\nother emerging techniques.\nAlthough full quanti ﬁcation by DESI-MS has not been\nperformed within this work, the capability for semiquantitative\nmeasurement is certainly apparent when visually comparing\nheat map intensities with reaction conversion data (%)\nFigure 4.

This method of obtaining data from the\npositional mass spectra could be further optimized by applying\nautomated and ML approaches now emerging in mass\nspectrometry imaging;\n26,27 this would likely improve both\nthe linearity of response and the sensitivityand therefore the\nthroughput. Full reaction conversion data sets for both the\nkinase and PAL reactions can be found inFigures S3, S4, and\nS12, respectively. In each case, a brighter spot corresponds\nwith higher reaction conversion allowing mutants with\nincreased activity to be identi ﬁed for each substrate. The\nmethod can detect products with as low as 9% conversion for\nkinase puriﬁed enzyme reactions and down to 3% for the PAL\nwhole cell reactions. Although it may appear that intersubstrate\nassessments can be made, it should be noted that, due to\nsubstrates’ diﬀering ionization eﬃciencies and aﬃnity to the\nnylon membrane, care should be taken when making such\ncomparisons.\nThe fastest throughput aﬀorded by this method corresponds\nto less than ∼50 s per sample without compromising data\nquality ( Figure 3 b), more than 30 times faster than an\nequivalent NMR screen and with much lower solvent\nconsumption. Some of the fastest colorimetric andﬂuorescent\nwell plate readers can aﬀord throughputs of 1 well plate every\n20 s (76.8 samples/s for a 1536 well plate) but do not have the\nlabel-free capability that mass spectrometry a ﬀords. If the\nproducts (or reactants) of interest are not inherently\nﬂuorescent or UV-active, these methods will be inappropriate.\nOther mass spectrometry platforms that are capable of high-\nthroughput screening include those coupled to fast chromato-\ngraphic systems and solid-phase extraction to“clean up” the\nsample before it reaches the mass spectrometer. Although this\n“clean up” may be desired to optimize the MS data output, it\noften utilizes excessive amounts of solvent and additional\nconsumables (such as columns and cartridges) which is\navoided with DiBT-MS.\nEmerging ultra-high-throughput MS coupled technologies,\nsuch as droplet microﬂuidics\n28 and acoustic mist ionization\nplatforms, 29 are beginning to o ﬀer subsecond sample\nthroughputs; however, commercially available instrumentation\nis still limited and in its infancy in comparison to DESI-MS.\nWe note that the throughput of this method could be further\nimproved through the implementation of robotic pipetting or\nacoustic dispensing systems to perform the solution prepara-\ntion steps as demonstrated by Morato et al.\n30 The addition of a\nslide changer within the DESI-MS instrumentation would also\nincrease the level of automation and throughput within the\nworkﬂow, allowing more samples to be analyzed consecutively\nwithout user intervention.\nThe inclusion of ion mobility within this workﬂow (Figure\n3c) increases identiﬁcation conﬁdence with an additional“drift\ntime” feature, characteristic of the product ion. This is of high\nutility in reduction reactions in which the mass shift between\nstarting material and product diﬀers by an increase in 2m/z\nunits. The drift time is also diagnostic and can separate\nisomeric and isobaric ions, for example, to determine the\nproducts of a regioselective reaction.\n31\n■ CONCLUSION\nThe DiBT-MS screening platform oﬀers a facile and rapid\nmethod for screening biocatalysts generated via directed\nevolution and protein engineering strategies. It provides\nproduct identi ﬁcation in a mobility-separated readout of\nactivity, in a heat map format which enables quantitative\nanalysis from crude reaction mixtures. The screen is performed\nwithout the need for additional puriﬁcation, solvent extraction,\nor chemical derivatization for product quantiﬁcation, which\noﬀers advantages over traditional techniques. In particular, this\nmethod facilitates screening for in vitro activity under harsh\nreaction conditions, such as the PAL-catalyzed ammonia\naddition, which requires 4 M ammonium carbamate to\nthermodynamically drive the hydroamination reaction to the\ndesired products.\n■ METHODS\nMaterials\nCommercially available reage nts were used without further\npuriﬁcation.

Cut membranes wereﬁxed to\na glass slide with double-sided tape ensuring aﬂat surface, and sample\nareas (5 mm× 5 mm) were marked with a scalpel in a grid formation\n(Figure S1). Excess tape was removed from around the membrane.\nKinase Biotransformations and19F NMR Analysis\nReactions were carried out in Tris buﬀer (50μL, 100 mM, pH 8.0) at\n37 °C for 24 h. The mixture contained monosaccharide (8 mM), ATP\n(10 mM), MgCl2 (5 mM), and GalK or NahK (6μg, ﬁnal kinase\nconcentration 0.12 mg mL−1). The presence of the sugar-1-phosphate\nproduct was determined by HRMS, and the conversion was\ndetermined quantitatively by\n19F NMR, according to the following\nmethod. Samples (50μL) were diluted with MeOH/H2O (1:1, 450\nμL) and centrifuged (10 000g, 5 min) to remove any insoluble matter.\nThe solution was transferred to a 5 mm NMR tube, with a sealed glass\ncapillary tube containing D2O for locking and referencing.19F NMR\nspectra were recorded at 25 °C on a Bruker Avance 500 MHz\nspectrometer (operating at 470 MHz) equipped with a QCI-F\ncryoprobe. Conversions were determined by taking the relative\nintegration of the corresponding resonances of the starting material\nand product, which were typically baseline-separated.\n8\nFor DiBT screening, reactions wereﬁrst diluted with MeOH/H2O\n(1:1, 300−450 μL). 0.5 μL of each solution was transferred onto a\npreprepared nylon membrane grid mounted on a glass slide as\ndetailed above and allowed to air-dry before analysis.\nWhole-Cell Biotransformations (PALs)\nWild-type AL-11 and variants were transformed into E. coli BL21\n(DE3) for yielding E. coli BL21 (DE3) pET28b-AL-11. A single\nJACS Au pubs.acs.org/jacsau Article\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/jacsau.1c00027\nJACS Au 2021, 1, 508−516\n513\ncolony was selected and grown in a 3 mL overnight starter culture\nsupplemented with 50μgm L−1 kanamycin at 37°C at 200 rpm. The\nfreshly prepared starter culture was used to inoculate 500 mL of LB-\nbased autoinduction media containing 50μgm L−1 kanamycin in 2 L\nbaﬄed ﬂasks at a rotary shaking rate of 200 rpm at 18°C for 72 h.\nThe cells were harvested by centrifugation (4°C, 3250g, 20 min). The\ncells were resuspended with KP i buﬀer (100 mM, pH 8.0) and\nharvested again by centrifugation (4 °C, 3250g, 20 min). The cell\npellet was subsequently aliquoted and stored at−20 °C.\nThe whole cell biotransformation was conducted by resuspending\n50 mg mL−1 cell paste in an appropriate volume of ammonium\ncarbamate solution (4 M, pH∼ 9.9, unadjusted) supplemented with\nthe relevant arylacrylic acid5a−5u at the required concentration (5\nmM for screening, 10 −20 mM for preparative applications). All\nbiotransformations were performed at 30°C with agitation of 250\nrpm. After a 24 h incubation period, the samples were centrifuged (5\nmin, 13 000 rpm) to remove cell debris. The crude supernatant was\nthen dissolved in 50% MeOH (v/v), and 500μL was transferred to a\n0.45 mmﬁlter vial for analysis by HPLC with the remaining solution\nreserved for analysis.\nConversion values for the PAL reactions of arylacrylic acids5a−5u\nwere determined by HPLC on a nonchiral reverse-phase Zorbax C-18\nExtend column (50 mm× 4.6 mm × 3.5 μm, Agilent), ﬂow rate 1.0\nmL min−1, temperature 40°C, detection wavelength 210 nm. Mobile\nphase: aq NH 4OH 0.1 M pH 10.0/MeOH, 9:1. For DESI-MS\nanalysis, 0.5 μL of each solution was transferred onto a preprepared\nnylon membrane grid mounted on a glass slide as detailed above and\nallowed to air-dry before analysis.\nEnantiomeric excess (ee) values for the isolated PAL reaction\nproducts were determined by HPLC on a chiral reverse-phase\nCrownpak CR(+)column (150 mm× 4m m× 3.5 μm, Daicel),ﬂow\nrate 1.0 mL min−1, temperature 40°C, detection wavelength 210 nm.\nMobile phase: aq HClO4 1.14% w/v/MeOH, 85:15.\nPreparative scale PAL reactions were performed as described above\nfor analytical scale reactions, with an increased substrate concen-\ntration (10−20 mM) and addition of DMSO (5% v/v) as a cosolvent.\nProducts were isolated by adsorption on ion exchange Dowex 50WX8\nresin and elution with ammonium hydroxide solution (as described\npreviously\n17).\nScreening of Metagenomic IREDs\nA 384-well ﬂat-bottomed plate containing a 0.5 mg CFE plate was\nacclimatized to room temperature. Each well was then resuspended to\n10 mg mL\n−1 in 0.1 M Tris-HCl pH 8.0. To a 384-well deep-well plate\n(Corning), the following solution was dispensed: 10 mM 6,7-\ndimethoxy-1-methyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline, 50 mM glucose, 0.5\nmM NADP+, 0.5 mg mL−1 GDH (CDX-901), and 4 mg mL−1 IRED\nlysate, made up to a total reaction volume of 50μL in 0.1 M Tris-HCl\npH 8.0. The plate was then sealed and centrifuged (1000 rpm, 1 min).\nThe 384-deep-well plate was then incubated at 30°C for 24 h at 1000\nrpm. The reaction was then quenched with the addition of 50:50\nMeOH/H\n2O and centrifuged (1000 rpm, 1 min) before DiBT-MS\nscreening. 0.5 μL from each well was transferred onto a preprepared\nnylon membrane grid mounted on a glass slide as detailed above and\nallowed to air-dry before DiBT-MS analysis.\nSingular IRED Biotransformations\nStock solutions of the IREDs were prepared (pIR-2, pIR-9, pIR-170,\npIR-204, and pIR-364) by weighing out crude lyophilized cell-free\nextract and rehydrated to a concentration of 10 mg mL\n−1 in 0.1 M\nTris-HCl buﬀer pH 8.0. Biotransformations were performed on a 500\nμL scale. The reaction mixture contained 10 mM dehydrosalsolidine3\n(6,7-dimethoxy-1-methyl-1,2,3,4-dihydroisoquinoline), 50 mM D-\nglucose, 0.5 mM NADP+, 0.5 mg mL−1 GDH (Codexis-901), 4 mg\nmL−1 IRED lysate, or 1 mg mL−1 AspRedAm (IMAC grade puriﬁed);\nthe reaction volume was made up to 500μL in 0.1 M Tris-HCl buﬀer\npH 8.0. Reactions were incubated at 30°C for 24 h. Reactions were\nquenched by the addition of 50μL of 10 M NaOH and extracted\ntwice with 750 μLo f tert-butyl methyl ester. The organic fractions\nwere combined and dried by MgSO4 and analyzed by HPLC on chiral\nstationary phase.10\n384-Well IRED Colorimetric Screen\nA Mastermix reagent was made up to 25 mL, containing 0.125 mg\nmL−1 INT and 10 mM amine substrate in Tris-HCl (0.1 M) adjusted\nto pH 9.0. 50μL of the Mastermix was aliquoted to each well of the\nplate. The plate was then spun down (1000 rpm, 1 min) and the 384-\nwell pierceable seal (4titude, Surrey, UK) removed. The plate was\nincubated (in the dark) at 30°C for 24 h. An absorbance reading atλ\n= 490 nm was taken at 0, 1, 4, and 24 h. False positives were detected\nin wells B02, D08, F12, H21, I02, I07, K16, O01, O08, and P17 from\nthe reaction of the enzyme with INT to INT-formazan as previously\ndescribed elsewhere.\n11 The same procedure was followed for the 384\nIREDy-to-go blank plate, except no amine was added to the\nMastermix.\nInstrumentation\nAll DiBT-MS experiments were performed on a SYNAPT G2 Si mass\nspectrometer (Waters Corporation, Manchester, UK) coupled with a\nDESI 2D Omni spray ion source (Prosolia, Indianapolis, IN).\nDESI Source\nDESI solvent was composed of a methanol−water mixture (49:1) at a\nﬂow rate of 2.5μL min−1. Nitrogen gasﬂow (3 bar) and a capillary\nvoltage of 3.5 kV or 4.0 kV (+ve/−ve respectively) were used to\ngenerate an electrospray plume toward the surface of interest. The\nDESI sprayer position was then adjusted to ensure that optimum\nsignal intensity was achieved from a solution of the product dried on a\nnylon membrane. The sampling area was deﬁned by HD Imaging\nsoftware V1.4 (Waters Corporation, Manchester, UK) with pixel size\nand stage speed deﬁned as per the throughput of the experiment\n(Figure 3b).\nMass Spectrometer\nThe mass spectrometer was operated using MassLynx v4.2 (Waters\nCorporation, Manchester, UK), with the source cone voltage\noptimized around 60 V and a source temperature of 150°C. The\ntrap and transfer cell voltages were set at 4 and 2 V, respectively. All\nmass spectrometry data were processed (0.2 Da window, 20 000\nresolution, top 10 000 peaks) and heat maps analyzed using HD\nimaging software.\n■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT\n*sı Supporting Information\nSupporting Information to accompany this article consists of\nthree ﬁles.

Wilson\n b and\nAnne-Kathrin Duhme-Klair\n *a\nBiocatalytic imine reduction has been a topic of intens e research by the artificial metalloenzyme community\nin recent years. Artificial construc ts, together with natural enzymes, ha ve been engineered to produce chiral\namines with high enantioselectivity. This review exami nes the design of the main classes of artificial imine\nreductases reported thus far and summarises approach es to enhancing their catalytic performance using\ncomplementary methods. Examples of utilising these biocatalysts in vivoor in multi-enzyme cascades have\ndemonstrated the potential that artIREDs can oﬀer, ho wever, at this time their use in biocatalysis remains\nlimited. This review explores the current scope of artIR EDs and the strategies used for catalyst improvement,\nand examines the potential for artIREDs in the future.\nIntroduction\nBiocatalysis remains an attractive target, capable of achieving\nhigh chemo-, regio- and enantio-selectivities under milder\nconditions than those required for traditional organometallic\ncatalysis.\n1,2 The preparation of chiral amines is a highly desirable\ntarget for biocatalysis. The enantioselective reduction of imines\nrepresents one key pathway to achieving some of these inter-\nmediates/products. Naturally-occurring enzymes capable of the\nasymmetric reduction of imine bonds in synthetic substrates\nwere only relatively recently reported by Mitsukura et al. in\n2010.\n4 Subsequently, the use of bioinformatics to scan large\ndatabases of enzymes has led to the discovery and development\nof many imine reductases (IREDs). 5 IREDs have been screened\nfor a large number of imine substrates, gradually expanding the\nknown substrate scope of these enzymes. While substantial\nprogress in the field of enzyme engineering, such as the\ntechnique of directed evolution, has led to the faster develop-\nment of other enzymes optimised for target substrates and\nconditions,\n3,6 with a few notable exceptions, 7,8 IREDs have\nreceived relatively little attention.\nIn vitroevolution has allowed the improvement of some IREDs\nto enable industrial biocatalysis.9 Rational improvement, in con-\ntrast, is often hampered by a limited understanding of the\na Department of Chemistry, University of York, UK.\nE-mail: anne.duhme-klair@york.ac.uk\nb York Structural Biology Laboratory, Department of Chemistry,\nUniversity of York, UK\nRosalind L.

Other\nconcerns, which include a still limited substrate scope,\n5 poor\nlong-term stability,12 high cost of development and the need for\nexpensive cofactors, such as NADH/NADPH 12–14 suggest that\ncomplementary approaches to natural metalloenzyme discov-\nery are merited for imine reduction.\nEven before the discovery of natural IREDs, artificial metal-\nloenzymes (ArMs), formed of a reactive metal catalytic centre\nwithin a protein scaﬀold, were designed to target imine\nreduction.\n15 The thought behind this design is to combine\nthe diverse reaction scope of synthetic organometallic catalysts\nwith selectivity influenced by a secondary coordination sphere\nfrom the protein scaﬀold. 16 The incorporation of an organo-\nmetallic complex inside a protein has several potential benefits\nincluding (i) compatibility with milder conditions, as for nat-\nural enzymes,\n17,18 (ii) protection from inactivation by external\nfactors such as thiols, water and oxygen, 19,20 (iii) increased rates\nof catalysis, 21,22 and (iv) improved enantioselectivity from the\npresence of an extensive and complex secondary coordination\nsphere that would otherwise be extremely challenging to\nachieve synthetically. 23,24 The organometallic catalysts used\nfor these artificial imine reductases (artIREDs) tend to use\nformate in place of the more expensive nicotinamide cofactors\nas a source of hydride for the reduction.\n25–27 The design of\nArMs also allows two complementary methods for optimising\nperformance as not only can the steric and electronic properties\nof the organometallic catalyst be optimised but also the protein\nscaffold.\n28,29\nAlthough results so far are promising, artIREDs are yet to\ndemonstrate improved selectivity or activity compared to more\nestablished chemical reduction methods. 30,31 The range of\naccessible products is also limited by the stability of the imine\nsubstrates in aqueous conditions necessary for the stability of\nthe protein scaﬀold. Cyclic imines tend to be stable in such\nconditions, but more hydrolytically labile noncyclic imines are\nmuch less so, limiting the types of amine intermediates that\ncan be produced. Amongst natural enzymes, reductive amina-\ntion has received more interest compared with imine reduction\nas it is a method of accessing a wider range of secondary and\ntertiary amines from cheap and readily accessible ketone and\namine precursors.\n11\nReports of the use of artIREDs in enzyme cascades, in vivo\ncatalysis that removes the need for protein extraction and\npurification and potential biomedical applications, present\nexciting future directions for some of these designs. However,\nthe greatest value in this research to date is the contribution to\nour understanding of the design of ArMs and the development\nof new methods and techniques for enhancing catalytic perfor-\nmance and selectivity. Much of the work reviewed in this article\nexamines imine reduction as a tool to demonstrate progress,\nwith the reduction of commercially available substrates, such\nas 1a–5a (Fig. 1), commonly used as benchmark reactions to\nexamine performance of the artIREDs. In addition, enantio-\nmerically pure salsolidine ( 1b), and other isoquinolines, are\nvaluable as biologically active alkaloids.\n32\nThere are multiple considerations in designing an artificial\nmetalloenzyme; primarily the selection of a suitable protein.\nOver 80 diﬀerent proteins have been used for the construction\nof ArMs and engineered to catalyse a huge variety of synthetic\nreactions, covered in a recent comprehensive review\n33 and\nrecorded in an online database (https://amp.ward-lab.ch/), pro-\nduced and maintained by the Ward group. Likewise, we guide\ninterested readers towards detailed reviews in the areas of\nnatural IREDs\n2,10,34 and synthetic organometallic imine\nreduction catalysts, 30,31,35 to avoid covering the same ground\nhere.

The non-covalent anchoring strategy is\nachieved by connecting an organometallic catalyst to biotin\nby a short linker, either from the bidentate ligand of the\ncatalyst (Fig. 2a)\n15 or from the arene ligand (Fig. 2b). 36 This\ncofactor spontaneously binds irreversibly to streptavidin. Dual\nanchoring has also been attempted with biotin attached to the\narene ligand and a coordinating histidine residue incorporated\nnear the site of the metal in the place of either S112 or K121\n(Fig. 2c).\n37\nInitially, several organometallic transfer hydrogenation cat-\nalysts were screened for the reduction of imine 1a.A Z5-Cp*Ir\npiano-stool complex was found to perform best even though\nthe Z6-(arene)Ru complex had previously proven best for ketone\nreduction.28 This catalyst was then incorporated into the ArM\nby linking a bidentate ligand of the metal complex to biotin via\nan aryl sulfonamide group. The biotinylated cofactor, which\nshows no enantioselectivity in the absence of the protein\nscaﬀold, when incorporated into wild-type streptavidin (Sav)\nresulted in a catalyst that furnished the ( R)-enantiomer of\nsalsolidine, 1b with 57% e.e.\n15 X-ray crystal structures of several\nstreptavidin (Sav) ArMs revealed that the enantioselectivity is\npartly derived from the configuration of the metal complex\nbound in the active site. It was hypothesised that the structure\nof the protein determined which enantiomer of the synthetic\ncofactor bound, despite a racemic mixture of the cofactor\nbeing added. This design has been extensively investigated,\nprimarily by the Ward group, with successful optimisation\nstrategies achieving high selectivity on a range of trial sub-\nstrates (Table 1).\nRibonuclease S\nAn a-helical peptide unit can be cleaved from ribonuclease A by\nsubtilisin to leave an S-shaped protein, ribonuclease S, from\nwhich the ArM is formed through assembly with a small\nsynthetic a-helical peptide. This non-covalent assembly is\nachieved spontaneously on combining the S-protein with the\nsynthetic peptide in a buﬀer solution at 37 1C.\n38 The synthetic\npeptide can be engineered to include coordinating amino acid\nlinkers, either natural or non-natural, to bind a metal ion or\ncomplex. Incorporation of this metallated synthetic peptide\nwith the S-protein results in the formation of the ArM (Fig. 3).\nEarly studies introduced Hg(\nII)39 and Cu( II)40 ions, but applying\nthis design for a transfer hydrogenase was not attempted until\nrecently.\nThis design has received only brief attention compared to\nthe streptavidin–biotin model. Multiple transition metal piano-\nstool complexes were investigated, with IrCp* proving the most\nsuccessful, with modest rate acceleration on incorporation into\nthe protein scaffold compared to the free metal catalyst.\nGenetic optimization was attempted via rational design where\nthree residues lying in close proximity to the metal ion were\nselected for mutagenesis, however, the triple mutant afforded\nno enhanced catalytic performance.\n38 Overall, the best enantio-\nmeric excess achieved was only 39% for ( S)-1b (Table 1). 33\nFig. 2 (a) The components of a streptavidin–biotin ArM.

The most successful artIRED constructed with\nwild-type CAII performed the asymmetric transfer hydrogenation\n1a to (S)-1b at 70% e.e. with a catalyst loading of 8.75 mol%.\nPeriplasmic binding protein\nAn artIRED, designed by the Duhme-Klair group,\n43 takes inspira-\ntion from an iron-uptake mechanism of microorganisms that\nsecrete small Fe(\nIII) chelating molecules ca lled siderophores. The\np a t h w a yi n v o l v e st h ec a p t u r eo fF e (III)-siderophore chelates by\ntheir cognate periplasmic binding proteins (PBPs) to aid their\ntransport to the inner membrane and into the cytoplasm of the\ncell. By anchoring an organometa llic catalyst to azotochelin, a\ntetradentate siderophore, this catalyst can be incorporated into\nt h eP B Pi nt h ep r e s e n c eo fF e (\nIII)( F i g .5 a ) .\nA key feature of this design is that the binding of this\ncatalyst-siderophore conjugate (Fig. 5b) with the PBP can be\nreversed by controlling the oxidation state of the Fe cation.\nWhile Fe(\nIII) binds tightly to the siderophore and the complex is\nstrongly bound to the PBP, reduction of Fe( III) to Fe( II) results in\na less thermodynamically stable and more kinetically labile\ncomplex that readily dissociates, releasing Fe(\nII).44,45 Oxidation\nof Fe( II) back to Fe( III) triggers reassembly of the artIRED with-\nout aﬀecting enantioselectivity, allowing recovery and recycling\nof the costly protein and replacement of the synthetic catalyst\nin the case of catalyst degradation (Fig. 5c).\nInitial work led to a [Cp*Ir(pyridinesulfonamide)Cl] complex\nthat significantly outperformed the more commonly used ami-\nnoethylsulfonamide ligand for the reduction of 1a under mildly\nacidic conditions tolerated by the protein. The Ir catalyst\nperformed at a rate around 20-fold slower once bound inside\nthe PBP scaﬀold but produced moderate selectivity for ( R)-1b\nwith an e.e. of 35% (Table 1). The crystal structure revealed that\nH227 was positioned in close proximity to Ir, indicating a\ndual anchoring system. This suggested that H227 binds to\niridium and may sterically impede the binding of hydride\nTable 1 Selection of some of the best enantioselectivities/activities achieved by the artIREDs designs examined in this review.

While replacement of H227\nwith non-coordinating alanine did improve the activity of the\nartIRED, although still not to the level of the free Ir catalyst, it\nled to a marked drop in enantioselectivity.\nOptimisation and development\nstrategies\nThe design of ArMs gives two complementary methods for\noptimising performance, through tuning the organometallic\ncofactor and by adapting the secondary coordination sphere\nprovided by the protein. There have been multiple approaches\nto optimising both of these components.\nOptimising the chemical component\nThe organometallic catalyst can be tuned, both through the\nmetal and the coordinating ligands. Examples of exchanging\nthe type of metal used are usually covered in the initial design\nof these ArMs. Work by Du¨rrenberger et al.,\n15 which established\nthe streptavidin–biotin design for imine reduction, investigated\nseveral catalysts including complexes of ruthenium, rhodium\nand iridium, with a IrCp* catalyst proving most successful,\nalthough arene-linked rhodium complexes have also received\nattention.\n36,37 Initial work on the Ribonuclease S artIRED also\ntested complexes of ruthenium, rhodium and iridium, again\nconcluding an IrCp* performs best in this scaffold also.\n38\nTuning the electronic properties of the catalyst via the\nligands was also investigated in early works optimising the\nstreptavidin, CAII and periplasmic binding protein scaﬀolds.\nThe streptavidin design was altered with the organometallic\ncatalyst linked to biotin via the arene ligand to allow greater\nfreedom to change the bidentate ligand of the iridium catalyst.\nLigands containing an amino amide core delivered the highest\nenantioselectivity for the reduction of 2a when incorporated\ninto wild-type Sav with up to 67% e.e. for ( S)-2b.\n36 Monnard\net al.42 likewise prepared a range of bidentate ligands for\noptimising the design of the CAII artIRED, achieving 70% e.e.\nfor ( S)-1b for WT CAII. In devising the PBP artIRED, it was\nfound a [Cp*Ir(pyridinesulfonamide)Cl] complex significantly\noutperformed the more commonly used aminoethylsulfona-\nmide ligand for the reduction of 1a hence was the catalyst of\nchoice in this design.\n43\nFurthermore, the length and attachment of the linker\nbetween the catalyst and the anchoring unit can greatly aﬀect\nthe performance of the catalyst. In one approach, a family of\ncomplexes with related structures, but variable linker lengths\nwere incorporated into CAII.\n17 Linkers that were shorter than\noptimal had a very high dissociation constant, indicating that\nthe biotinylated cofactor readily dissociated from the protein.\nCofactors containing linkers one and two atoms longer than\nthis gave much smaller dissociation constants, in line with\nquantitative binding of the cofactor to CAII, but markedly\ndiﬀerent catalytic activity, exhibiting the importance of the\nsecondary coordination sphere to which the metal is exposed.\nOptimising the protein scaﬀold\nSite-directed and site-saturation mutagenesis. One of\nthe most widely used approaches to optimising the protein is\nrational design, where residues in close proximity to the metal,\nidentified from crystal structures of ArMs, are exchanged\nfor other amino acids or peptide motifs in an attempt to alter\nthe secondary coordination sphere.\n46,47 The most common\nchanges are exchanging non-coordinating amino acids for\ncoordinating residues or the addition or removal of bulky\nresidues in the binding pocket. The nature of the amino acids\nin the active site aﬀects the stereochemistry at the metal\ncomplex and the position in which the substrate can interact\nwith the metal complex; hence, their alteration provides oppor-\ntunities for the optimisation and customisation of ArMs.\nAn interesting example attempted to confine the metal\ncofactor inside streptavidin by adding sterically bulky structure\naround the biotin-binding vestibule.\n48 Analysis of crystal struc-\ntures of Sav artIREDs revealed that the metal ion is not precisely\nlocalised in the Sav protein, indicated a by less than full occupancy.\nFig. 5 (a) Schematic of the ArM based on a periplasmic protein scaﬀold.\nThe design comprises of an azotochelin anchoring unit, which forms a\ncomplex with Fe III, with this complex being bound by the periplasmic\nbinding protein.

Biol., 2020, 1, 369- -378 This journal is© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020\nIt was thought that confining the metal more precisely would\nimprove catalytic activity. Multiple residues around the active\nsite were individually exchanged for short protein loops.\nMutants with no change in protein stability or tendency\nto aggregate were identified and these positions were selected\nfor the insertion of well-defined, naturally occurring protein\nmotifs, as a method of introducing steric bulk. The resulting\nchimeric scaﬀolds did not aﬀect biotin-binding capability but\nnor did they significantly help in localising the metal cofactor,\nalthough, in some cases, improved turnover numbers (TONs)\nwere observed.\nSite-saturation mutagenesis goes a step further, where\nselected residues are exchanged with a complete or slightly\nreduced library of amino acids and the resulting variants\nscreened for improved catalytic activity. This method has an\nadvantage in that it does not require the exact eﬀects of\nexchanging one amino acid for another to be predicted, screen-\ning a library of variants often produces more successful results.\nFor streptavidin, this initially identified two variants, S112A\nwhich produced ( R)-1b (96% e.e.) and S112K, which produced\n(S)-1b (78% e.e.).\n15 The fact that selectivity for either enantio-\nmer can be accessed through modifying the same protein\nstructure emphasises the importance of the directing eﬀect of\nthe secondary coordination sphere.\nComputational design. The trial-and-error approach to opti-\nmising the protein component of the ArM is time-consuming\nand costly.\n49 Computational modelling was used to map the\nmechanistic behaviour of a Sav artIRED to gain a better under-\nstanding of how diﬀerent residues in the secondary coordina-\ntion shell aﬀects the enantioselectivity.\n50 Computations for two\n(R)- and ( S)-selective Sav variants revealed that the energy\ndiﬀerence between the transition states for the two products\nagreed well with the observed enantioselectivity. It is hoped\nthat by aiding our understanding of reaction mechanisms,\ncomputational modelling can help identify changes to optimise\nthe protein structure directly through rational design, reducing\nthe number of mutants to be tested.\nThe Rosetta design algorithm was employed by the Baker\nand Ward groups\n29 in an attempt to optimise the CAII artIRED\nand demonstrate the progress of computational methods on\nenzyme redesign. It was theorized that improving the stability\nand localization of the organometallic cofactor would lead to\nimproved occupancy and performance. The algorithm identi-\nfied four CAII variants with small numbers of mutations that\neither increased the hydrophobicity of the binding pocket,\nimproved the packing interactions between the protein and\nthe cofactor, or increased the rigidity of the protein backbone.\nThese mutations led to a 46- to 64-fold improvement in the\naﬃnity of the cofactor for the protein scaﬀold and to significant\nimprovements in enantioselectivity and activity. Modifications\nto the cofactor to increase the hydrophobicity of the Cp* ligand\ngave further improvement in enantioselectivity. This resulted\nin the most ( S)-selective artIRED for 1b reported up to 2015,\nwith one of the variants performing with 96% e.e. and a 6-fold\nincrease in turnover number compared to the wild-type\nartIRED.\n33\nEngineering to improve fine-tuning. A larger scale engineer-\ning approach on the streptavidin design was recently reported\nto improve the fine-tuning of the secondary coordination\nsphere.51 Streptavidin assembles as a tetramer, constructed\nfrom a dimer of dimers, where the biotin-binding pockets are\nlocated at the interface between two protein chains (Fig. 6a).\nAny mutation of residues in this pocket is, therefore, displayed\ntwice, reducing the amount of fine control in engineering the\nprotein structure. By fusing the C-terminus of one subunit to\nthe N-terminus of a second via a 26 amino acid linker, a single-\nchain dimer (scd) was formed where mutations can now be\nselectively made in one subunit without being reflected in the\nother. Additionally, H127, at the interface between the resulting\npair of dimers, was mutated to a cysteine to form a disulfide\nbridge, further stabilising the structure (Fig. 6b). The resulting\nfinely tuned mutants performed well, with many displaying\nsignificant rate enhancement of the Cp*Ir cofactor, as well as\ngood enantioselectivity. The best performing variants on sub-\nstrates 1–5a achieved the following significant results: ( R)-1b\nwith 100% conversion and 96% e.e., ( R)-3b with 99% conver-\nsion and 93% e.e., and ( R)-4b with 90% conversion and 98% e.e.\nwith catalyst loadings of 0.25 mol%. Substrates 2a and 5a\nproved more challenging, with all variants displaying only\nmoderate enantioselectivity for 2b and poor conversion to\n5b.\n51 Additionally the biotin-binding capacity of one unit in\nthe single-chain dimer could be removed to reduce the varia-\nbility of catalytic performance depending on the cofactor : Sav\nratio. Most monovalent scdSav artIREDs were found to outper-\nform their equivalent divalent scd artIREDs, among them, the\nbest variants for producing ( R)-3b (91% e.e., 100% conversion,\n0.05 mol% catalyst loading), ( R)-4b (96% e.e., 99% conversion,\n0.05 mol% catalyst loading) and ( S)-5b (91% e.e., 98% conver-\nsion, 0.5 mol% catalyst loading).\n51\nDirected evolution. Although other design strategies had\ninitially had some success, it has proved challenging to\npredict the subtle eﬀects of protein structure and bonding on\nenantioselectivity.\n23,52 To date, our lack of understanding of\nhow the fine details of protein structure relate to activity has\nFig. 6 (a) Scheme of streptavidin assembled as four units (tetramer)\nwhere the biotin-binding pockets of two neighbouring units are located\nat a shared interface, showing one biotinylated cofactor bound per dimer.\nThe anchor represents the anchoring group, biotin, red = catalyst.

These two dimers are linked\nvia a disulfide bridge (yellow line) by mutating H127 for cysteine.\nReview RSC Chemical Biology\nThis journal is© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020 RSC Chem. Biol., 2020, 1, 369- -378 |375\nresulted in limited progress in the development of biocatalysts\nby rational design. 22 Instead, researchers have looked to the\ncombinatorial approaches used in the optimisation of natural\nenzymes, in particular, directed evolution, which has provided\na massive breakthrough in the engineering of enzymes for\nincreased stability, activity, selectivity and reaction scope.\n52\nDirected evolution is the use of repeated cycles of random muta-\ngenesis and/or DNA recombination to bring about diversity in the\nprotein scaﬀold. High-throughput screening methods are essential\nto identify those protein variants with improved characteristics.\nIt was previously recognised that screening mutants was far\ntoo time-consuming to consider using directed evolution\nbecause of the need to purify proteins before addition of the\nbiotin-catalyst cofactor. If catalyst testing could be carried out\nin cell extracts and cell lysates, it would speed up development\nof artIREDs. However, screening in cellular contents poses\nproblems as heavy metal catalysts are often deactivated by\ncellular components such as thiols, in particular glutathione.\nPre-treatment of cell extracts and lysates with an oxidising\nagent could be one way of overcoming this limitation since\noxidised glutathione does not significantly aﬀect heavy metal\ncatalysts. A diamine, DiAm (Fig. 7), proved most eﬀective,\nallowing for measurable activity of artIREDs in both cell-free\nextracts and cell lysate,\n53 which significantly reduces the time\nneeded to prepare multiple variants for screening.\nIn a pioneering study, 54 directed evolution was carried out\non a small library of amino acids located around the iridium\ncatalyst. It was concluded that bulky residues can limit the\ndegrees of freedom of the bound cofactor, increase the inter-\nactions between the protein and the metal ion and influence\nthe enantioselectivity observed. Two mutants, one selective for\n(R)-2b (95% e.e.) and one for ( S)-2b (86% e.e.), were identified,\nwith both displaying increased reaction rates and enantioselec-\ntivity compared to the previously best performing Sav artIREDs.\nThe study also explored the tolerance of mutants to biphasic\nconditions, with some mutants showing improved enantio-\nselectivity, although for others reduced activity was seen.\nImmobilisation and encapsulation. Strategies to improve\nthe stability and performance of Sav artIREDs by use of\nimmobilisation or other tertiary environments have been inves-\ntigated. Immobilisation of Sav artIRED variants on silica nano-\nparticles covered with an organosilica film was found to protect\nthe catalysts from deactivation, even in the presence of cellular\ndebris and the organic solvent methanol. The nanoparticles\ncould be recycled up to three times with only a minor loss of\nselectivity.\n12\nAnother study encapsulated S112A, S112K and S112A-K121A\nSav artIRED variants inside ferritin, an iron storage protein,\nwhich provides a tertiary coordination shell for the solvent\nexposed catalyst. Encapsulation of the artIRED was achieved\nby exposing ferritin to low pH, at which the protein would\nunfold, before raising the pH together with the addition of the\nartIRED, allowing ferritin to refold around the artIRED. This\nhad a remarkable eﬀect on enantioselectivity, with ( S)-1b\nproduced irrespective of the Sav mutant used, proving that this\ntertiary coordination sphere strongly influences the catalytic\nmechanism. This inversion of enantioselectivity was not seen,\nhowever, for 2b, with the observed selectivity in line with that\nexpected for the un-encapsulated artIRED. Overall, the encap-\nsulated artIREDs performed relatively poorly with regards to\nconversion and enantioselectivity but some mutants did display\nan increased TON.\n55\nFuture directions\nBiocatalysis\nIn vivo. In vivo catalysis oﬀers an attractive alternative to\nisolated ArMs since it removes the need for protein extraction\nand purification steps making them easier to apply to large-\nscale catalysis. If the engineered ArM is proven to be stable\ninside the cell, it brings additional benefits of increased\nprotection from external factors and easy removal following\ncatalysis. In vivocatalysis has been achieved with Sav artIREDs\nby engineering Sav to be expressed in the periplasm of E. coli.\n56\nThe periplasm was targeted due to the significantly lower\nconcentration of glutathione compared to the cytoplasm.\nGlutathione deactivates many organometallic catalysts, even\nonce incorporated into an ArM, hence it was hoped that by\nexpressing Sav in the periplasm, the artIRED could assemble\nand perform imine reduction successfully. A 24-residue motif\nwith a well-defined tertiary structure was engineered to be\nincorporated near to the surface of the biotin-binding site in\na further attempt to minimise deactivation of the catalyst by\nexternal factors. Substrate 6a was used to test localisation and\nactivity of artIREDs since reduction of the imine bond triggers\ndecomposition to 6b and the fluorescent dye umbelliferone, 6c\n(Fig. 8), allowing the reaction to be followed by fluorescence\nspectroscopy. Results proved the successful localisation of Sav\nin the periplasm and the formation of a functional artIRED by\naddition of biotinylated cofactor.\nEnzyme cascades. Enzyme cascades represent an exciting\napplication of these ArMs, being an attractive method of\nachieving complex multistep syntheses without the use of\nprotecting groups or the isolation and purification of inter-\nmediates. There have been several successful reports of Sav\nartIREDs being incorporated into cascades with natural enzymes.\nCascades examined to date can be split into two categories, the\nfirst being the introduction of artIREDs into cascades where\nadditional enzymes are used to enhance the enantiomeric purity\nof an amine product from the reduction of an imine substrate by\nthe artIRED (Fig. 9a). These cascades typically consist of a\nselective artIRED which favours production of one enantiomer\nof the amine, and a second enzyme, for example a MAO\n(monoamine oxidase), LAAO (\nL-selective amino acid oxidase)\nFig. 7 Structure of the diamine DiAm.\nRSC Chemical Biology Review\n376 | RSC Chem. Biol., 2020, 1, 369- -378 This journal is© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020\nor DAAO ( D-selective amino acid oxidase), which selectively\noxidises the unwanted enantiomer back into the imine starting\nmaterial leading to accumulation of the desired enantiomer\nover time.\n57\nArtIREDs have also been engineered to use the bioavailable\nhydride donor cofactors NADPH or NADH in place of formate.\nW h i l es u c ha r t I R E D sh a v eb e e nc o m b i n e di nt h ef i r s tc a t e g o r y ,58\nthey have had wider use in the secondary category of cascades,\nwhere the product of interest is formed by a downstream\nnatural enzyme (Fig. 9b). Downst ream enzymes incorporated so\nfar have performed hydroxylations\n57 and asymmetric reduction of\na,b-unsaturated compounds14 along with examples of multistep\ncascades. In one such example, an alcohol dehydrogenase was\nused to regenerate NADPH. A two-step cascade was designed to be\ncarried out by the alcohol dehydrogenase and the artIRED. In the\nfirst step, a linear amino alcohol was converted to cyclic imine 4a\nby the alcohol dehydrogenase w ith simultaneous reduction of\nNADP+. The artIRED then used the resulting NADPH to reduce the\nimine 4a to its corresponding amine, 4b (Fig. 9c).58\nChallenges. There are, however, significant limitations to be\nsolved before artIREDs can be seriously exploited for biocata-\nlysis. So far, few attempts have been made to carry out catalysis\non an industrially-relevant scale.\n51 Even then, the access to a\nlimited number of amine products, plus competition from\nIREDs, may give few biocatalysis options. Attempts to improve\nstability, tolerance to organic solvents or cheaper costs should\nlead to improved commercial prospects, however, the engineer-\ning techniques that can be used to improve these character-\nistics are equally applicable to natural enzymes hence artIREDs\noﬀer no increased advantage.\nBiomedical applications\nIt has been proposed that artIREDs could have significant\nbiomedical applications. Carbonic anhydrases are overex-\npressed on the surface of multiple types of cancer cells. It is\nhoped that by converting these surface exposed proteins into\nArMs, anti-cancer ‘‘prodrugs’’ could be activated in the immedi-\nate proximity of cancer cells in the future. In this system,\ngenetic optimisation of the protein was not accessible since it\nrelied on the expression of CAII as it would appear on the\nsurface of host cells, hence a study was carried out to determine\nthe best design of arylsulfonamide-catalyst cofactor. Strains of\nE. coli were engineered to express CAII in localised compart-\nments of the cell; the cytoplasm, periplasm and the cell surface.\nFig. 8 Highly conjugated substrate, which on reduction of the imine,\ndecomposes to release umbelliferone, which can be detected by fluores-\ncence spectroscopy.\nFig. 9 (a) Schematic of the first category of enzyme cascade which lead to the enrichment of one enantiomer from the reduction of the imine by the\nArM. (b) A general scheme for the second category of cascade where the role of the ArM is recycling a cofactor and the product of interest is produced by\nthe downstream enzyme. (c) A cascade for a multistep synthesis where the ArM is responsible both for cofactor recycling and producing the end product.\nReview RSC Chemical Biology\nThis journal is© The Royal Society of Chemistry 2020 RSC Chem. Biol., 2020, 1, 369- -378 |377\nThe selected cofactors were then introduced and the activity of\nthe artIREDs tested on an imine substrate 6a, which releases\nthe fluorescent dye umbelliferone 6c on reduction. The results\nidentified an improved cofactor for incorporation into wild-type\nCAII for in vivowhole-cell catalysis.\n17 It will prove exceptionally\ninteresting if the work reported in E. coliwith CAII artIREDs can\nbe replicated in eukaryotic cells.\nEngineering artIREDs to accept nicotinamide cofactors\nas hydride sources in place of formate potentially opens up\nfurther biomedical applications as iridium piano-stool com-\nplexes of the type commonly incorporated into the artIRED\ndesigns included in this review have been shown to have anti-\ncancer properties.\n59 Whether artIREDs could have the same\neﬀect remains to be seen.\nConclusions\nOver a range of diﬀerent artIRED designs and optimisation\nstrategies, significant progress in catalytic performance and\nenantioselectivities has been achieved. The development of\nnew screening techniques has proven important in allowing\nfaster development and use of methods, such as directed\nevolution.\n53,54,56 Progress in the use of computational model-\nling to better understand the interactions between the synthetic\ncatalyst and the protein looks to have potential to help with the\ndesign of better performing ArMs. 49,60 Immobilisation of artIR-\nEDs has provided additional ways to improve stability and\nrecovery strategies.\n12,55\nIn summary, artIREDs have exciting potential biomedical\napplications in addition to biocatalysis opportunities, in parti-\ncular their use in enzyme cascades and in whole cell in vivo\ncatalysis. Successes in altering and improving the activity of\nartIREDs will play a crucial role in designing and developing\nArMs, not only for imine reduction, but also other synthetically\nchallenging reactions. The knowledge gained from optimising\nArM designs for imine reduction will help to establish new strategies\nand methods for producing eﬃcient, highly enantioselective ArMs.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conflicts to declare.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research\nCouncil for financial support (grant numbers EP/L024829/1,\nEP/T007338/1 and EPSRC studentship EP/N509802/1 for R.

The recombinant gene was overexpressed in Escher -\nichia coli and the protein CpIM1 was purified to homogeneity. This protein belongs to the Ornithine cyclo -\ndeaminase/ μ -crystallin (OCD-Mu) family of proteins which has only a few characterized members. CpIM1 \ncatalyzed the alkylamination of α -keto acids/esters producing exclusively ( S )- N -alkyl amino acids/esters e.g. N- \nmethyl- L -alanine with > 90% conversion and > 99% enantiomeric excess (ee). The enzyme showed the highest \nactivity for the alkylamination of pyruvate and methylamine leading to N- methyl- L -alanine with an apparent K\nM \nof 15.04 ± 2.8 mM and V\nmax \nof 13.75 ± 1.07 μ mol/min/mg. CpIM1 also catalyzed (i) the reduction of imines e.g. \n2-methyl-1-pyrroline to ( S )-2-methylpyrrolidine with ~30% conversion and 75% ee and (ii) the dehydrogenation \nof cyclic amino acids e.g. L -Proline (as monitered by reduction of cofactor NADP\n+\nspectrophotometrically).   \n1. Introduction \nChiral amines are essential functional groups in many bioactive \nmolecules, and ~40% of active pharmaceutical ingredients and 20% of \nagrochemicals contain one or more chiral amine moieties [1] . The \nsynthesis of these bioactive molecules in their optically pure form \ntraditionally involves heavy metal catalysts, reagents, solvents that pose \nenvironmental problems and the extensive use of protecting groups. \nThus, reducing the efficiency of modern manufacturing processes. \nTherefore, it is necessary to develop improved environmentally benign \nmethods. For these reasons, importance of biocatalysts, which are ste -\nreo-, regio-and chemo-selective, requiring mild operating conditions \nand water as the solvent, is ever-increasing [2 – 4] . \nThe last decade saw several reports for the biocatalytic synthesis of \nchiral amines, including resolution of racemic amines using lipases and \nmonoamine oxidases, asymmetric synthesis using transaminases, imine \nreductases, and amine dehydrogenases [5 – 9] . Enzymatic imine reduc -\ntion is the most promising approach since the single-step asymmetric \nreduction of prochiral imines to the corresponding amines can theoret -\nically yield 100% of the required enantiomer. Further, the reduction of \nimines generated in situ by the condensation of amines and carbonyl \ncompounds can be used to synthesize almost any primary, secondary, or \ntertiary amine [1] . Enzymes of several structurally unrelated protein \nfamilies catalyze the reduction of C = N bonds in pathways responsible \nfor the synthesis of folate, alkaloids, siderophores, and antibiotics; \nhowever, many of these enzymes have been studied only for their \nphysiological and biomedical relevance [1] . \nTwo enantio-complementary NADPH-dependent imine reductases \n(IREDs), that natively reduced 2-methyl-1-pyrroline (2-MPN) from \nStreptomyces spp. by were first reported by Mitsukura et al ., [10 – 12] . The \napplication of these enzymes in the asymmetric reduction of a variety of \ncyclic imines, iminium ions, and biocatalytic cascades has generated \ninterest in IREDs as catalysts for the synthesis of chiral amines. Several \nresearch groups worldwide have screened and characterized numerous \nIRED homologs [13 – 19] but successfully isolated only a few IRED ho -\nmologs that are capable of reductive amination of carbonyl substrates \nwith amines [19 – 21] . In addition to IREDs ketimine reductases (KIREDs) \nand Δ 1-piperidine-2-carboxylate/ Δ 1-pyrroline-2-carboxylate re -\nductases (PipC/PyrC REDs) reportedly reduce several naturally occur -\nring cyclic imino-acids [22] . Some amine dehydrogenases are known to \ncatalyze reductive amination of ketones with ammonia [23] . At the \nsame time, proteins like L -amino acid dehydrogenases and opine de -\nhydrogenases (which natively couple α -amino acids with α -keto acids) \nhave been engineered to broaden the substrate scope to improve their \n* Corresponding author. \nE-mail address: anjuc@faculty.iitm.ac.in (A.

Imine reducing activ -\nities of various yeasts are known, and our earlier work on Candida par -\napsilosis ATCC 7330 reported the reduction of aryl imines using whole \ncells of this yeast [ 6 , 30 ]. Notably, no imine reductases from yeasts have \nyet been characterized, and only recently ene-reductases from Saccha -\nromyces spp. have been reported to reduce C = N group of oximes pro -\nmiscuously [31] . To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of a \npurified and characterized imine reductase from yeast. \n2. Materials and methods \n2.1. Gene cloning \nThe genomic DNA of Candida parapsilosis ATCC 7330 was isolated \nfrom liquid culture using the lithium acetate (LiOAc)-SDS method [32] . \nBriefly, 1 ml of culture was centrifuged, and the cell pellet was resus -\npended in 100 mM lithium acetate, 1% sodium dodecyl sulfate \n(LiOAc-SDS) solution to lyse the cells. Subsequently, DNA was precipi -\ntated by adding three parts of ethanol, followed by centrifugation at \n18000 g. The obtained pellet was resuspended in 100 µ l of ultrapure \nwater and again centrifuged, and the supernatant transferred to a fresh \ncentrifuge tube and stored at -20 \n◦\nC. \nThe isolated genomic DNA was used as a template for amplifying the \nCandida parapsilosis imine reductase gene (CpIM1) using the primers: \nIm1_F CATATG AAGGTCATTAGAGATAAAGAT (Nde1) \nIm1_R GAATTC AAATTTGGTCTAAAAGTCAT (EcoR1) \nThe amplified product was purified from agarose gel and ligated into \npGEMT vector by TA cloning. The resulting construct, pGEMT-IM1, was \ntransformed into Escherichia coli DH5 α for bulk production of the cir -\ncular plasmid. The plasmid pGEMT-IM1 was isolated from respective \ntransformed colonies of E. coli DH5 α and subjected to digestion by Nde 1 \nand Eco R1. The insert obtained was ligated into expression vector \npET28a by directional cloning. \n2.2. Protein expression and purification \nAfter the pET28a-IM1 construct was verified by sequencing, E. coli \nBL21 (DE3) was transformed by the plasmid pET28a-IM1. The success -\nfully transformed E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells containing the pET28a-IM1 \nconstruct were grown in Lysogeny broth to 0.6 – 0.8 OD\n600 \nat 37 \n◦\nC. \nThen 1 mM isopropyl β - D -1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to \ninduce the expression of recombinant CpIM1 at 23 \n◦\nC incubated for 18 h. \nThe induced cells were harvested and stored at -80 \n◦\nC until further use. \nThe purification of overexpressed CpIM1 was carried out by metal \naffinity chromatography on GE Ӓ KTA fast protein liquid chromatog -\nraphy system (GE Biosciences), installed inside a cold cabinet. All the \npurification steps were carried out at 4 \n◦\nC or on ice. The E. coli BL21 \n(DE3) cells containing overexpressed CpIM1 were resuspended in a \nbuffer containing 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl, and 4 mM \nbenzamidine hydrochloride, and lyzed using ultrasonic cell disruptor \n(SONICS Vibracell VCX130) set at 60% amplitude for 2 min (1 second \non, 2 s off). After ultra-sonication, the lysate was centrifuged at 15000 g \nto separate cell debris and was loaded onto a HisTrap FF column (5 ml, \nGE Biosciences). The bound recombinant protein was washed with 50 \nmM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 30 mM imidazole and eluted with \n50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 300 mM imidazole. This \nprotein solution was concentrated by ultrafiltration and loaded on to \nHiTrap Desalting column (5ml, GE Biosciences) to desalt and change the \nbuffer as required. The purified protein samples were routinely quanti -\nfied by the Bradford method and analyzed by SDS – PAGE, followed by \nCoomassie Brilliant Blue R250 staining. \n2.3. Analytical gel filtration \nAnalytical gel filtration was performed on a fast protein liquid \nchromatography (FPLC) system ( Ӓ KTA purifier, GE Biosciences) with a \ncolumn manually packed with GE Sephacryl G200 resin, the mobile \nphase with buffer containing 50 mM Tris-Cl (pH 7.5), 300 mM NaCl. \nProtein standards used were procured from Sigma-Aldrich. \n2.4. Comparison of primary and secondary structure \nBlastP was used to identify proteins that are similar in sequence to \nCpIM1 [33] . Multiple sequence alignment was constructed using \nPSI/TM-Coffee [34] . CpIM1 was modeled with ROBETTA protein \nstructure prediction server, and structural comparisons were made using \nTM-align [ 35 , 36 ]. \n2.5. Determination of enzyme activity \nThe imine reduction/alkylamination activity of the enzyme was \ndetermined by monitoring the decrease in the absorbance of the cofactor \nNAD(P)H at 340 nm using UV visible spectrophotometer (JASCO) at \n25 \n◦\nC. The assay mixture contained an appropriate amount of the pro -\ntein, 1 – 4 mM of the imine substrate, and 0.2 mM of NAD(P)H in 50 mM \nTris-Cl buffer at pH 7.5. For reductive amination with substrates, the \nassay mixture consisted of an appropriate amount of the protein, 1 – 10 \nmM of the α -ketoacid/ketoester, 1 – 100 mM amine substrate, and 0.2 \nmM of NADPH in 50 mM Tris-Cl buffer at pH 7.5. One unit of the enzyme \nactivity is defined as the amount of enzyme that oxidized 1 μ mol of \nNADPH per minute at the specified assay conditions. For measuring the \noxidative activity, 10 mM of oxidized cofactor NADP\n+\nwas used at pH \n10.5, and the increase in absorbance at 340 nm monitored. When \nnecessary, the substrate stocks were prepared in dimethyl sulfoxide \n(DMSO) and added to the reaction mixture such that the final DMSO \nconcentration was 5% (v/v). \n2.6. Determination of pH optima \nThe pH optima of CpIM1 were determined for using sodium pyruvate \nand methylamine in case of alkylamination and 2-methyl-1-pyrroline (2- \nMPN) for imine reduction. Thus, the assay mixture contained an \nappropriate amount of the protein, 10 mM sodium pyruvate, 50 mM \nmethylamine/4 mM 2-MPN, and 0.2 mM of NAD(P)H in buffers at \nvarious pH. \n2.7. Kinetics with sodium pyruvate and methylamine as substrates \nThe kinetic parameters (K\nM \nand V\nmax\n) of CpIM1 were determined \nusing sodium pyruvate and methylamine as substrates. Since the enzyme \nhas three substrates, i.e., sodium pyruvate, methylamine, and NADPH, \nthe apparent V\nmax \nand K\nM \nwere calculated by measuring activities on \nvarying concentrations of one substrate with fixed non-limiting con -\ncentrations of the other two substrates. Non-limiting concentrations of \n0.2 mM for NADPH, 50 mM for methylamine, and 10 mM for sodium \npyruvate were used to invoke pseudo-first-order kinetics. Thus, the assay \nmixture consisted of 50 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.5), an appropriate amount \nof the protein, 0.1 – 50 mM sodium pyruvate, 1 – 50 mM methylamine, \nand 0.2 mM of NADPH. All measurements were carried out in triplicates. \n2.8. Enzymatic biotransformations and analysis of the reaction product \nEnzymatic biotransformations were carried out in 1 ml scale to \nconfirm the formation of the product. For alkylamination reactions, the \nreaction mixture consisted of 5 – 10 mM of α -ketoacid, 50 – 100 mM amine \nsubstrate, and 12 – 15 mM of NADPH in 50 mM Tris-Cl buffer at pH \n7.5 – 8.5. For imine reduction, the reaction mixture consisted of 4 mM of \nthe substrate, 6 mM NAD(P)H in 50 mM Tris-Cl buffer at pH 7.5 – 8.5. \nV.N.M. Uma Mahesh and A.

After three-hour incubation at 25 ˚ C, the reaction was stopped by \nadding a one-tenth volume of 10 N sodium hydroxide and further \nderivatized/extracted (supplementary section) to be analyzed by Gas \nChromatography-Mass spectrometry (GC-MS, Shimadzu QP2010). \n3. Results and discussion \n3.1. Identification of candidate gene \nThe whole cells of Candida parapsilosis ATCC 7330 catalyze the \nasymmetric reduction of prochiral imines to chiral amines as reported \n[6] . This implies the presence of stereospecific imine reductase(s) in this \nyeast. The preliminary investigation revealed that no gene from Candida \nparapsilosis showed significant sequence similarity to IRED sequences \nfrom Streptomyces spp. or any other IRED homologs which have been \nreported [10 – 19] . The CpIM1 gene was identified using a human Mu \ncrystallin (CRYM) gene sequence as a template, which is reportedly a \nketimine reductase that catalyzes the alkylamination of various \nketo-acids [37] . CpIM1 showed a 24.5% identity with the human CRYM \ngene and belonged to the ornithine cyclodeaminase (OCD-Mu) family of \nproteins. The OCD-Mu protein family consists of oxidoreductases acting \non carbon-nitrogen bonds, which are widely distributed and contain \nproteins with diverse functions. Mammalian KIREDs, plant and archaeal \nPipC/PyrC REDs reduce cyclic imino acids, some of which have been \nexplored for the biocatalytic synthesis of chiral N -alkyl amino acids [ 22 , \n37 – 39 ]. Cyclodeaminases from several gram-negative bacteria catalyze \nconcerted oxidative-deamination cyclization and reduction of ornithi -\nne/lysine [40 – 42] . The other members of the OCD-Mu protein family \ninclude opine dehydrogenases from marine sponges, N -((2 S )-2-ami -\nno-2-carboxyethyl)- L -glutamate dehydrogenase (ACEGA) from Staphy -\nlococcus aureus , alanine dehydrogenase (Adh) from archaeon \nArchaeoglobus fulgidus and iminosuccinate reductase from Paracoccus \ndenitrificans [43 – 47] . It is also true that only a few members of this \nprotein family have been characterized beyond gene annotation, making \nit an interesting and important area to explore and understand. \n3.2. Analysis of the primary structure \nAs the first step towards the investigation of imine reductases from \nthis yeast, well-characterized homologs of CpIM1 were identified using \nBlastP [33] . Multiple sequence alignment and a phylogenetic tree were \nthen constructed using PSI/TM-Coffee [34] ( Fig. 1 , Supplementary \nFigures S1 and S2). The present study revealed that among the charac -\nterized members of the OCD family, CpIM1 was closest to plant OCD \nhomologs ( Arabidopsis thaliana and Huperzia serrata ), followed by \nHuman CRYM and other mammalian OCD homologs (Supplementary \nFig. S2). The conserved motif GXGXXA/G/S (marked by the box in \nFig. 1 ) is present in CpIM1 and the other OCD/ μ -crystallin family \nmembers, indicating the presence of the Rossmann fold for cofactor \nbinding [48] . The mechanism and role of residues lining the active \npocket in the OCD-Mu family is studied in detail in Streptomyces pristi -\nnaespiralis L -Lysine cyclodeaminase (SpLCD) [41] and Pseudomonas \nFig. 1. Multiple sequence alignment showing the key conserved residues among the sequences of CpIM1 and other characterized OCD-Mu proteins.  \nV.N.M. Uma Mahesh and A. Chadha                                                                                                                                                                                                      \nBiotechnology Reports 31 (2021) e00664\n4\nputida ornithine cyclodeaminase (PpOCD) [42] . Among these residues \nArg48, Met65, Lys76, and Arg118 are conserved in CpIM1 (marked by \nan arrow in Fig. 1 ) and most other OCD-Mu homologs. The residues \nLys76 and Arg118 interact directly with the carboxyl group of the sub -\nstrate while Arg48 is thought to form hydrogen bonds with the substrate \nand the water molecule that transfers a proton during imine reduction. \nThe exact role of Met65 is not understood, although it is conserved in \nmost OCD-Mu proteins. The residues Glu56 (Glu63) and Asp228 \n(Asp236) from SpLCD (PpOCD), which are considered critical for \ncyclodeaminase activity are not conserved in CpIM1, plant and \nmammalian OCD homologs. Instead, the position occupied by Asp228 in \nSpLCD is occupied by serine in all the mammalian OCD homologs which \nis also suitably positioned to act as a proton donor [22] . In CpIM1, this \nposition is occupied by bulky tyrosine, marked by the blue arrow in \nFig. 1 . \n3.3. Protein overexpression and purification \nThe CpIM1 gene was amplified using the genomic DNA of Candida \nparapsilosis ATCC 7330 as the template and was cloned into the pET28a \nvector system overexpressed in E. coli BL21 (DE3). The His6-tagged \nCpIM1 was purified by metal affinity chromatography and showed a \nmolecular weight of 42 kDa on SDS-PAGE ( Fig. 2 a) in agreement with its \ntheoretical value (351 aa). This is slightly higher than other known \nmembers of OCD-Mu family proteins (CRYM Homo sapiens 313 aa, \nAlanine dehydrogenase from Archaeoglobus fulgidus 322 aa, and orni -\nthine cyclodeaminase from Pseudomonas aeruginosa 310 aa) [ 37 , 42 , 46 ]. \nLike other members of the OCD-Mu family proteins, CpIM1 was found to \nexist as a homodimer as confirmed by analytical gel filtration ( Fig. 2 b). \n3.4. Effect of pH on enzyme activity \nThe enzyme showed maximum activity in the pH range of 6.8 – 9.0 for \nalkylamination of sodium pyruvate with methylamine ( Fig. 3 a). There \nwas a sharp decrease in activity on either side of this pH zone. In a \nsimilar study that was carried out using 2-methyl-1-pyrroline (2-MPN), a \ncyclic imine, which was stable in an aqueous medium around neutral \npH, the enzyme showed activity over a broader pH range of 5-9 ( Fig. 3 b). \nThe human KIRED, which has a pH optimum of 5 for reduction of cyclic \nimino-acids [49] , showed better conversion for alkylaminations of \nα -ketoacids at pH 8.5 [22] . Since the alkylamination proceeds by the \nformation of an imine intermediate, the nucleophilic attack by methyl -\namine on the carbonyl carbon of α -ketoacids is favourable at pH near the \npKa of the amine (~10 in case of methylamine). In essence, alkylami -\nnation is favoured at basic pH. \nThe oxidation of proline was preferred towards basic pH with the \nFig. 2. (a) SDS page showing purified CpIM1 (~42 kDa), protein ladder in lane A; (b) CpIM1 confirmed to be a dimer (~ 90 kDa) by analytical gel filtration.  \nFig. 3.

Substrate scope and enantiospecificity \nCpIM1 catalyzed alkylamination of various α -ketoacid/ketoesters \n( Table 1 ). Among the reactions studied, the highest activity is seen for \nsodium pyruvate with methylamine (amine) in the presence of NADPH \nas a cofactor, resulting in the formation of N -methyl alanine (Supple -\nmentary Figure S4). This reaction exclusively produced N- methyl- L - \nalanine, which is the ( S ) enantiomer ( > 99% enantiomeric excess (ee), \nSupplementary Figure S5) of the product as confirmed by GC-MS after \nderivatizing with a chiral reagent ( R )-menthyl chloroformate (Supple -\nmentary scheme S3). The mammalian KIREDs and Thermococcus litoralis \nOCD are also known for alkyl-amination of various α -ketoacid/ketoest -\ners and produce L -amino acids [ 22 , 37 , 39 ]. While CpIM1 and mamma -\nlian KIREDs use NADPH [ 22 , 37 ], Thermococcus litoralis OCD is known to \nutilize NADH as cofactor [39] . CpIM1 also catalyzed similar reactions \nwith ethylamine and ammonium chloride producing N -ethyl alanine \n(Supplementary Fig. S8) and L -alanine (Supplementary Figs. S6 and S7). \nThe specific activities were 20 and 100-fold less, respectively, compared \nto that of methylamine ( Table 1: entries 2 and 3). The human KIRED \nreportedly shows comparable activities for both, methylamine and \nethylamine [37] . The archaeal members of the family Archaeoglobus \nfulgidus Adh and Thermococcus litoralis OCD show significantly higher \nactivity with ammonia/ammonium chloride as the amine substrate [ 39 , \n50 ]. CpIM1 did not show any alkyl-amination activity of sodium pyru -\nvate with dimethylamine, benzylamine, and hydroxylamine, while \nseveral mammalian KIREDs are known to show activity with benzyl -\namine [22] . CpIM1 also displayed good activity with ethyl pyruvate and \nmethylamine ( Table 1: entry 4). It did not show any significant activity \nwith phenylpyruvic acid and phenylglyoxylic acid (with methylamine) \nwhen assayed at pH 7.5; however, on incubation with excess of enzyme \nat pH 8.5, the formation of corresponding N -methyl α -amino acids was \nobserved as analyzed by GC-MS (Supplementary Figs. S9,10). The \nhuman CRYM and other mammalian OCD homologs show moderate \nactivity with phenylpyruvate and methylamine (compared with \nTable 1 \nGeneral scheme and specific activities for CpIM1 catalyzed alkylaminations  \n1 mU is defined as the amount of the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of one nanomole of the substrate (NADPH) per minute under the specified conditions of the \nassay method. \na \nInferred based on comparison with authentic derivatized standard \nb \nInferred based on expected mass spectra of the product \nc \nInferred on comparison with the crude chemically synthesized product \nd \nApparent activity recorded after allowing polymeric ethyl glyoxylate to dissociate in reaction buffer for 1 hr \nV.N.M.

The poor activity of CpIM1 with \nphenylpyruvic acid and phenylglyoxylic acid may be due to the presence \nof bulky tyrosine residue instead of serine (in mammalian KIREDs), \nwhich projects into the active site [22] . Alkylamination of ethyl \n2-oxo-4-phenyl butanoate [a keto-ester] with methylamine was cata -\nlyzed by CpIM1 with a considerable activity of 1760 mU ( Table 1: entry \n7), implying that two carbon length separation between the ketoacid \nmoiety and the phenyl ring allowed proper binding of the substrate. The \nformation of the product was confirmed by GC-MS (Supplementary \nFig. S12,13). CpIM1 also showed formation of product ethyl sarcosinate \nwith ethyl glyoxylate and methylamine (Supplementary Figure S11). \nThe direct alkylamination of α -keto-esters by a member of of OCD-Mu \nfamily is reported here for the first time. \nIn addition to alkylamination, CpIM1 catalyzed imine reduction with \ncyclic imine 2-methyl-1-pyrroline (2MPN) and aromatic imine N -ben -\nzylideneaniline ( Table 2: entries 1-2), albeit with very low activity when \ncompared to that observed for alkylamination of sodium pyruvate and \nmethylamine. The specific activity observed for the reduction of 2- \nmethyl-1-pyrroline 44 ± 2 mU/mg is comparable to some of the re -\nported IREDs, e.g., 50 ± 20 mU/mg from Streptomyces sp. 3456 [12] , 66 \nmU/mg from Pseudomonas putida KT2440, and 20 mU/mg from Paeni -\nbacillus elgii B69 [13] . Interestingly, reduction of 2MPN occurred spe -\ncifically with NADH producing ( S )-2-methylpyrrolidine (75% ee, \nSupplementary Figure S16). Inhibition was observed at concentrations \nabove 5 mM of 2MPN. The reduction of N -benzylideneaniline occurred \nwith NADH and NADPH. The formation of products with 2MPN and \nN -benzylidene aniline was confirmed by GC-MS by comparison with \nauthentic product standards (Supplementary Figs. S15 and S17). The \nswitching of cofactor specificity has also been observed in the case of \nporcine and bovine KIREDs with specific substrates [49] . Although, \nCpIM1 showed some activity with N -(1-phenylethylidene) benzenamine \n(52 mU/mg), the conversion was not significant (Supplementary \nFigs. S18). \nCpIM1 also catalyzed the dehydrogenation of L -proline and 4-hy -\ndroxy- L -proline in the basic pH range of 9.0 – 10.5. With L -proline as \nsubstrate, CpIM1 showed the highest activity of 420 mU/mg at pH 10.5 \n( Table 2: entry 3), while activity with 4-hydroxy- L -proline was about \n100-fold less and was barely detectable under the assay conditions. \nHowever, this reaction required higher concentrations of cofactor \nNADP\n+\n(1 mM) for appreciable rates unlike reductions, which required \nonly 0.2 mM of reduced cofactor NADPH. CpIM1 did not show any ac -\ntivity with D -proline when assayed under identical conditions. Interest -\ningly, quite like human KIRED, CpIM1 did not show oxidation of N - \nmethyl- L -alanine (the product from methylamination of sodium pyru -\nvate) under any of the tested conditions. \n3.6. Steady-state kinetic parameters \nSince the enzyme has the highest specific activity for methylamina -\ntion of sodium pyruvate, which involves three substrates, i.e., sodium \npyruvate, methylamine, and NADPH, two sets of experiments were \ncarried to for determination of kinetic parameters to invoke pseudo-first- \norder kinetics: (i) concentration of pyruvate was varied with non- \nlimiting concentrations of the other two substrates (0.2 mM for \nNADPH, 50 mM for methylamine) (ii) concentration of methylamine \nwas varied with fixed concentration of pyruvate (10 mM) and NADPH \n(0.2 mM). CpIM1 followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics in the first set of \nexperiments with pyruvate as a substrate with an apparent K\nM \nof 15.04 \n± 2.8 mM and V\nmax \nof 13.75 ± 1.07 μ mol/min/mg ( Fig. 4 a). In the \nsecond set of experiments, the determination of K\nM \nand V\nmax \nwith \nmethylamine was inconclusive since the rate of reaction did not saturate \neven with 50 mM of methylamine, and further addition of methylamine \nled to a drastic increase in pH ( Fig. 4 b). Human KIRED is reported to \nbehave similarly [37] . The apparent K\nM \nobserved for CpIM1 was higher \nthan that of human CRYM (2.9 ± 0.3 mM) [37] but comparable to that of \nN -Methylalanine dehydrogenase from Pseudomonas MS ATCC 25262 \n(K\nM \nof 15 mM) [51] , which is structurally unrelated but catalyzes the \nsame reaction. However, V\nmax \nof CpIM1 is higher than values reported \nfor both human CRYM (2 ± 0.3 μ mol/min/mg) and N -Methylalanine \ndehydrogenase from Pseudomonas MS ATCC 25262 (0.37 \nμ mol/min/mg) [ 37 , 51 ]. Two other enzymes, which are structurally \nunrelated to CpIM1, PipC/PyrC reductases from P. putida [52] , and \nP. syringae [53] , have higher specific activities (42 μ mol/min/mg and \n140 μ mol/min/mg) for the same reaction. \nTable 2 \nSpecific activities for CpIM1 catalyzed imine reduction and oxidations.   \nSubstrates (reduction) Specific activity (mU/mg) \n1 \n 44 ± 2 \n2 \n 28  \nSubstrates (oxidation)  \n3 \n 420 ± 32 \n1 mU is defined as the amount of the enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of \none nanomole of the substrate (NAD(P)H/ NAD(P)\n+\n) per minute under the \nspecified conditions of the assay method. \nFig. 4.

Since apparent saturation was observed with pyruvate \nbut not with methylamine, it can be concluded that the enzyme has \nbinding site for pyruvate. This is supported by the crystal structure of \nmouse KIRED (4BV9), which has pyruvate in the active site [54] . Thus, \nimine formation can occur within the active site by the action of \nmethylamine on the enzyme-bound pyruvate. \n4. Conclusion \nA novel imine reductase gene CpIM1 isolated, cloned, and overex -\npressed from the versatile biocatalyst Candida parapsilosis ATCC 7330 is \nreported. Its biochemical properties and the substrate scope and enan -\ntiospecificity of the purified CpIM1 were explored. CpIM1 catalyzed \nalkylamination of α -ketoacids and α -ketoesters producing ( S )-alkyl \namino acids/esters, which are essential building blocks for the phar -\nmaceutical agents, especially the emerging peptide drugs. It also \ninherently reduced several imines to corresponding amines and cata -\nlyzed dehydrogenation of cyclic amino acids. The enzyme seemed to \nprefer substrates with a carboxylic acid moiety and would make an \nattractive candidate for directed evolution to accept ketones as sub -\nstrates. Further mutational and crystallographic studies will not only \nprovide insights into the structure and mechanism of CpIM1 but also aid \nin understanding the structure-function relationship in the OCD-Mu \nprotein family. \nDeclaration of Competing Interest \nThe authors whose names are listed immediately below certify that \nthey have no affiliations with or involvement in any organization or \nentity with any financial interest (such as honoraria; educational grants; \nparticipation in speakers ’ bureaus; membership, employment, consul -\ntancies, stock ownership, or other equity interest; and expert testimony \nor patent-licensing arrangements), or non-financial interest (such as \npersonal or professional relationships, affiliations, knowledge or beliefs) \nin the subject matter or materials discussed in this manuscript. \nAcknowledgments \nOne of the authors (M V N Uma Mahesh) acknowledges the Council \nof Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR, India) for fellowship.

{"text": "ARTICLE\nVersatile selective evolutionary pressure using\nsynthetic defect in universal metabolism\nLara Sellés Vidal 1,2, James W. Murray 2 & John T. Heap 1,2,3✉\nThe non-natural needs of industrial applications often require new or improved enzymes. The\nstructures and properties of enzymes are difﬁcult to predict or designde novo. Instead, semi-\nrational approaches mimicking evolution entail diversiﬁcation of parent enzymes followed by\nevaluation of isolated variants. Artiﬁcial selection pressures coupling desired enzyme prop-\nerties to cell growth could overcome this key bottleneck, but are usually narrow in scope.\nHere we show diverse enzymes using the ubiquitous cofactors nicotinamide adenine dinu-\ncleotide (NAD) or nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) can substitute for\ndefective NAD regeneration, representing a very broadly-applicable arti ﬁcial selection.\nInactivation of Escherichia coli genes required for anaerobic NAD regeneration causes a\nconditional growth defect. Cells are rescued by foreign enzymes connected to the metabolic\nnetwork only via NAD or NADP, but only when their substrates are supplied. Using this\nprinciple, alcohol dehydrogenase, imine reductase and nitroreductase variants with desired\nselectivity modiﬁcations, and a high-performing isopropanol metabolic pathway, are isolated\nfrom libraries of millions of variants in single-round experiments with typical limited infor-\nmation to guide design.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-27266-9 OPEN\n1 Imperial College Centre for Synthetic Biology, Imperial College London, London SW7 2AZ, UK.2 Department of Life Sciences, Imperial College London,\nLondon SW7 2AZ, UK.3 School of Life Sciences, The University of Nottingham, Biodiscovery Institute, University Park, Nottingham NG7 2RD, UK.\n✉email: john.heap@nottingham.ac.uk\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS|         (2021) 12:6859 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-27266-9 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 1\n1234567890():,;\nC\natalysts are essential to increase chemical reaction rates in\na wide range of industries. Enzymes have advantages over\nnon-biological catalysts including high chemoselectivity,\nstereoselectivity, and positional selectivity; and activity under\nmild temperature and pressure conditions, which also decreases\nundesired side reactions\n1. These advantages can decrease costs\nand increase process performance and sustainability. Enzymes are\nused both in industries with unchanging catalytic requirements,\nsuch as the manufacture of commodity chemicals and products or\nas active agents in cleaning products; and to meet the ongoing\nneed for new specialized catalytic steps in synthetic-chemistry\nroutes to bespoke pharmaceutical or agrichemical compounds2.\nHowever, despite the vast diversity of natural enzymes and the\nreactions they catalyze, often no optimal enzyme can be identiﬁed\nfor a speciﬁc application, typically due to low afﬁnity or activity\nfor the target substrate or a lack of stability or activity under\nrequired conditions such as high temperatures or organic\nsolvents3.\nIn principle, enzymes with new or improved properties could\nbe designed rationally on the basis of structural information, or\neven de novo, but in practice, this is rarely straightforward.\nDirected evolution is one of the most powerful tools for protein\nengineering, since it bypasses the need to determine speci ﬁc\nsequences and structures a priori by mimicking the process of\nnatural evolution in the laboratory2,4. Starting from one or more\nparent enzymes with properties close to the desired ones, libraries\nof many variants are readily generated using targeted and/or\nrandom mutagenesis. Variants with desired improvements occur\nvery rarely in such libraries, if at all, so identifying and isolating\nimproved variants is usually the key challenge5. Typically, var-\niants of interest are identiﬁed through screening, where individual\nvariants from samples of the library are isolated and the target\nproperty evaluated. This is generally a laborious and time-\nconsuming process, except in special cases with convenient\nreadouts such asﬂuorescence5. The need for screening is a fun-\ndamental constraint on throughput which limits the success and\nscope of directed evolution. Artiﬁcial selection pressure approa-\nches offer an attractive alternative, since they link an improve-\nment in the target property to the survival of the variant. Such\napproaches do not require variants to be isolated for evaluation\nand automatically discard non-functional variants, thus allowing\nmuch higher throughput than screening. However, the techniques\navailable so far tend to be narrowly applicable only to very spe-\nciﬁc types of biomolecules or properties6. Here, we exploit a\nsynthetic metabolic defect to apply a broadly-applicable artiﬁcial\nselection pressure to diverse biocatalysts, using genetically-\nmodiﬁed E. coli under special conditions.\nWild-type (WT)E. coliis a facultative anaerobe, normally able\nto grow by aerobic respiration using oxygen, anaerobic respira-\ntion using alternative electron acceptors, or anaerobic fermenta-\ntion without an external electron acceptor. Strict anaerobic\nfermentation is a closed system in which consumption by gly-\ncolysis of a ﬁnite supply of the redox cofactor oxidized nicoti-\nnamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) must be stoichiometrically\nmatched by regeneration of NAD+ through reduction of central\nmetabolites to form fermentation products. InE. coli, NAD+ is\nnormally regenerated largely by ethanol formation. Unlike in\nyeast, ethanol production serves no other known physiological\nrole inE. coli. Inactivation of this pathway preventsE. coligrowth\nby anaerobic fermentation7 (Fig. 1a), presumably due mainly to\nNAD+ depletion blocking glycolysis, although pyruvate and\nacetyl-CoA will also accumulate to unnatural levels with various\nimpacts on metabolism. Anaerobic fermentative growth of such\nmutants can be rescued by introducing pathways that reinstate\nﬂuxes from central metabolites and restore NAD+ regeneration.\nThis can provide a useful selection pressure to identify redox-\nactive pathways, enzymes, and variants with desired properties\nuseful for the production of products such as butanol, 2-\nmethylpropan-1-ol, L-alanine, and 2,3-butanediol 8–11 (related\nselections can be achieved involving different mutations, NADP\nand/or aerobic conditions\n12–14). It is dif ﬁcult to discern the\ncontributions to the selection of NAD+ regeneration, relieving\ncentral metabolite accumulation, and restoring otherﬂuxes.\nWe hypothesized that regeneration of NAD+ by a metaboli-\ncally isolated foreign enzyme, using an externally-supplied sub-\nstrate not otherwise connected to the native metabolic network,\nwould be sufﬁcient to restore glycolysis and thereby growth. If so,\na strong artiﬁcial selection pressure could be applied to libraries\nof enzyme variants for activity with substrates that are not pro-\nduced within cells, linking restoration of growth by anaerobic\nfermentation to the presence of a variant possessing a desired new\nor improved activity with a non-natural substrate (Fig.1b). This\nbroader scope would be compatible with the development of\nbiocatalysts active upon non-biogenic compounds for which no\nbiosynthetic pathway exists in any organism, so cannot be pro-\nduced using introduced heterologous pathways, which represent\nthe great majority of chemotypes used as precursors and inter-\nmediates in synthetic chemistry. Reports published during the\npresent study applied such selection using acetoin11,13, butE. coli\ncontains native acetoin reductase activity11,15, and our present\nstudy found acetoin alone was sufﬁcient to rescue the metabolic\ndefect, so acetoin cannot be considered isolated from nativeE. coli\nmetabolism.\nHere we validate and expand upon the above concept, apply it\nto rapidly obtain variants from large libraries (comprising tens of\nmillions of variants) in several different cases, and hence estab-\nlish a rapid, high-throughput, widely-applicable platform for\ndirected evolution of biocatalysts and other biomolecules whose\nactivity can be directly or indirectly coupled to the regeneration\nof NAD+.\nResults\nSynthetic defects in NAD+ regeneration abolishing anaerobic\ngrowth can be rescued by metabolically isolated foreign\nenzyme-substrate pairs. To implement the arti ﬁcial-selection\nsystem, a genetically-modiﬁed E. colistrain (strain AL) unable to\nregenerate NAD+ during anaerobic fermentation was constructed\nby inactivating the genes encoding the ethanol pathway\n(bifunctional aldehyde-alcohol dehydrogenase, adhE) and, to\neliminate a potential mutational escape route7, the lactate path-\nway (lactate dehydrogenase,ldhA). When cultured aerobically in\na minimal medium, AL cells grew similarly to WT cells. However,\nthey were unable to grow anaerobically in the same medium,\nindicating the expected impairment of anaerobic fermentation\n(Fig. 1c).

NAD(P)-depen-\ndent oxidoreductases have been extensively engineered to make\nthem more suitable for speciﬁc applications, targeting properties\nsuch as kinetic parameters, substrate speci ﬁcity, or cofactor\npreference19–22. Switching the cofactor preference of NADP-\ndependent enzymes to NAD is of particular interest due to the\nlower cost and higher stability of NAD, and the higher efﬁciency\nof cell-free NAD recycling systems23,24, for which low-cost co-\nsubstrates are available. Substrate selectivities, and modiﬁcations\nto them, are not generally computationally predictable. NAD/\nNADP selectivity is a partial exception, as the many known\nexamples and a common structural motif enabled the develop-\nment of a computational design tool, CSR-SALAD, which\nrepresents the state of the art in cofactor-selectivity reversal25,26.\nAlcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs), also known as ketoreduc-\ntases (KREDs), are of great industrial interest primarily due to\ntheir ability to perform an asymmetric reduction of aldehydes and\nketones. Thanks to their regioselectivity and stereoselectivity,\nADHs can be used not only to produce enantiomerically pure\nalcohols, but also other types of compounds, such asγ- and δ-\nlactones through the desymmetrisation of meso-diols27,28. The\nprimary-secondary alcohol dehydrogenase ofClostridium beijer-\ninckii (CBADH) reduces this organism ’s waste acetone to\nisopropanol, but is strictly NADP-dependent, which is unusual\nin anaerobic fermentation29 (Fig. 2a). An efﬁcient NAD-utilizing\nacetone reductase variant of CBADH would be useful in\nindustrial biotechnology and cofactor recycling, so we set out to\nevolve one.\nCSR-SALAD was used to analyze CBADH, predict residues\ncritical for cofactor preference, and design a cofactor preference\nreversal strategy. The software suggested 567 protein variants\nencoded by a library of 648 genetic variants of positions G198\n(substitutions to DEGKNRS), S199 (to DGHILNRSV), and Y218\n(to ADFINSTVY), located at the cofactor binding pocket close to\nthe 2′ phosphate group of NADP (Fig.2b). CSR-SALAD assumes\nreversal would cause substantial loss of activity, and proposed\nsubsequent rounds of site-saturation mutagenesis and screening\nto attempt to recover activity, initially prioritizing I175 and R200.\nA previous manual analysis of the CBADH crystal structure\nproposed substitutions of residues G198, S199, R200, and Y218 to\nreverse cofactor preference\n29, but neither the speciﬁc substitu-\ntions proposed nor saturation mutagenesis of S199 yielded any\nNADH-dependent variants of the closely-related Clostridium\nautoethanogenum ADH30. Here we applied the proposed\nsubstitutions to CBADH, constructing variants CBADH R1\n(S199G, R200G, and Y218F) and CBADHR2 (G198D, S199G,\nR200G, and Y218F), but plasmids encoding these variants did not\nrestore anaerobic growth of AL cells in minimal medium\nsupplemented with 15 mM acetone, indicating low or absent\nNADH-dependent activity.\nWe performed full combinatorial saturation mutagenesis of all\nfour target residues of CBADH (G198, S199, R200, and Y218)\nreplacing each codon with NNN to yield a library (CBADHLib)o f\n16.8 million unique genetic variants encoding 160,000 unique\nprotein variants. Every variant proposed by CSR-SALAD was\nincluded, comprising only 0.4% of the library. By including R200,\nthe activity loss that CSR-SALAD envisages as an emergent\nproblem to be solved by subsequent recovery is addressed\nsimultaneously during cofactor preference reversal.\nTo select for CBADH variants able to accept NAD, AL cells\nwere transformed with the library, and pools of variants were\nincubated anaerobically in a minimal medium supplemented with\n15 mM acetone, so that any variant with NADH-dependent\nacetone-reducing activity would lead to a regeneration of NAD+,\nrestoring growth. For this library and each similar case in this\nstudy, multiple independent transformations (six for this library)\nwere used to obtain complete library coverage (approximately 18\nmillion transformant clones in this case) and samples were\nsequenced to conﬁrm diverse codon incorporation. Clones from\neach transformation were pooled and subjected to selection\nseparately. Growth was observed in three of the variant pools\n(Fig. 2c) so these were each subcultured under the same\nconditions once, then plasmid DNA was extracted and\nsequenced, revealing the presence of the same CBADH variant\nin each case (CBADH\nS) with G198D, S199Y, and Y218P\nsubstitutions. Interestingly, NAD-dependent mouse class II\nalcohol dehydrogenase (ADH2)31, which is distantly related to\nCBADH, contains D227 and P247 which are equivalent positions\nto 198 and 218 in CBADH. CBADHS was not among the 567\nvariants proposed by CSR-SALAD. The selection of the same\nvariant in three independent experiments indicates the super-\niority of this variant, the strength of the arti ﬁcial selection\npressure, and its utility to isolate variants. Transforming AL cells\nwith isolated plasmid encoding CBADHS enabled fast anaerobic\ngrowth in a medium containing acetone (Fig. 2d). Acetone\nconsumption and corresponding isopropanol generation were\nconﬁrmed by 1H-NMR (Supplementary Table 1). Unlike the\nparent enzyme CBADHWT, puriﬁed CBADHS was unable to\noxidize isopropanol using oxidized NADP (NADP +) as the\ncofactor, but could do so with NAD + (Km = 17.49 mM,\nkcat = 333 min−1 and kcat/Km = 316.67 M−1 s−1, Supplementary\nFig. 1 and Supplementary Table 2).\nEliminating transhydrogenase activities provides strict cofactor\nselection allowing exceptional reversal of cofactor preference.\nUnexpectedly, we observed that AL cells were able to slowly grow\nanaerobically in a medium with acetone when transformed with\nthe parent enzyme CBADH WT, despite its strict NADP-\ndependence (Fig. 2c, d). We hypothesized that acetone-\ndependent anaerobic growth recovery by CBADHWT could be\nmediated by the activity of one or both ofE. coli’s two transhy-\ndrogenases, PNTA and STHA, which could use the NADP +\nproduced by CBADHWT to oxidize NADH. To test this hypoth-\nesis, we generated E. coli strains with knockout mutations of\ntranshydrogenase genespntA (ALP strain), sthA (ALS strain), or\nboth (ALPS strain) in addition to knockout mutations ofadhE and\nldhA. We then tested the ability of CBADHWT and CBADHS to\nrestore anaerobic growth of ALP, ALS, and ALPS cells. The ALP\nand ALS strains, each with one intact transhydrogenase gene, were\nable to grow anaerobically in a medium with acetone when\ntransformed with either NADP-dependent CBADHWT or NAD-\ndependent CBADHS (Supplementary Fig. 2). However, only\nNAD-dependent CBADH S could support acetone-dependent\nanaerobic growth of ALPS cells, which lack either intact trans-\nhydrogenase gene (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. 2). This\ndemonstrates that transhydrogenases are indeed responsible for\nthe acetone-dependent recovery of anaerobic growth by\nCBADHWT, and that either STHA or PNTA alone is sufﬁcient to\ngenerate the required NAD+ to sustain anaerobic growth. Inter-\nestingly, this is thought to be the non-physiological direction for\nthe membrane-bound, ‘energy-linked’ transhydrogenase PntA32.\nDue to its inability to grow anaerobically when transformed with\nan NADP-dependent oxidoreductase, the transhydrogenase-free\nALPS strain provides a more stringent selection system than the\nAL, ALP, or ALS strains, strictly requiring NAD-dependent oxi-\ndoreductase activity to restore growth.\nARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-27266-9\n4 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS|         (2021) 12:6859 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-27266-9 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications\nTo validate the ALPS strain as a selection host, we used it to\nevolve NAD-dependent variants of TBADH, an NADP-\ndependent alcohol dehydrogenase from Thermoanaerobacter\nbrockii closely related to CBADH29. Similarly to CBADHWT,\nWT TBADH was able to support the anaerobic growth of AL cells\nin a medium supplemented with acetone, but not of ALPS cells\n(Fig. 2g). We performed full combinatorial saturation mutagen-\nesis of residues G198, S199, R200 and Y218 of TBADH to\ngenerate a library (TBADHLib) of 16.8 million unique genetic\nvariants (Fig. 2e). A similar selection procedure as for CBADH\nwas followed but using the ALPS strain, and two different\nvariants were identiﬁed, TBADHS1 and TBADHS2. TBADHS1 had\nFig. 2 Selection of alcohol dehydrogenases with reversed cofactor selectivity. aCBADH (Clostridium beijerinckii alcohol dehydrogenase) and TBADH\n(Thermoanaerobacter brockii alcohol dehydrogenase) catalyze the reduction of acetone to isopropanol exclusively using NADPH, as well as the reverse\nreaction. b Cofactor binding site of CBADHWT with NADPH bound (PDB code 1KEV).

Surprisingly,\nTBADHS2 contained a duplication of residues 191 −241, in\naddition to substitutions in the targeted residues, both in the\npositions of the original sequence and in the corresponding\npositions of the duplication (Supplementary Fig. 3). The\nsubstitutions were G198H, S199R, R200A, Y218M, G198’A, and\nR200’K (198’and 200’denote positions 249 and 251 of TBADH\nS2,\nthe positions in the duplication equivalent to the original 198 and\n200 residues). Since the duplication was not intentionally\nintroduced into the variant library by design, it presumably arose\nthrough a rare event during the PCR, ligation or within cells,\nhighlighting the potential of the selection system to isolate\nvariants with desired properties even when these are rare and\noutside the intended design space.\nTBADHS1 and TBADHS2 were both able to restore the anaerobic\ngrowth of ALPS cells in a medium with acetone (Fig.2g), and\n1H-NMR of the fermentation broth conﬁrmed the production of\nisopropanol (Supplementary Table 1). When the enzymatic activity\nwas assayed, TBADHS1 could oxidize isopropanol only with NAD+,\ncertifying the reversal of cofactor preference (Supplementary Fig. 1\nand Supplementary Table 2). Thekcat of TBADHS1 for the oxidation\nof isopropanol with NAD+ was 112 ± 5.7 min−1,4 . 5t i m e sl o w e r\nthan the kcat of TBADHWT for the same reaction with NADP+.\nHowever, theKm of TBADHS1 for isopropanol was 3.74 ± 0.54 mM,\na 32-fold decrease (improvement) compared to theKm of TBADHWT\nfor isopropanol in the presence of NADP+. Overall, the catalytic\nefﬁciency (kcat/Km)o fT B A D HS1 for the oxidation of isopropanol\n(kcat/Km =496.67 M−1 s−1) was more than seven times greater than\nthat of TBADHWT with NADP+ (kcat/Km =70 M−1 s−1). This is, to\nour knowledge, the highest relative catalytic efﬁciency obtained in any\ncase of cofactor speciﬁcity reversal for an alcohol dehydrogenase, and\nthe best for the reversal of preference from NADP to NAD for any\nenzyme. In contrast, TBADHS2 was able to oxidize isopropanol both\nwith NAD+ and NADP+ (in the presence of NAD+, Km =22.07\nmM, kcat =238.5 min−1 and kcat/Km =180 M−1 s−1; in the presence\nof NADP+, Km =55.15 mM,kcat =231.4 min−1 and kcat/Km =70 M\n−1 s−1; Supplementary Fig. 1, Supplementary Table 2). A decrease in\nkcat compared to TBADHWT was observed, but the Km for\nisopropanol decreased (improved)i nt h ep r e s e n c eo fb o t hc o f a c t o r s .\nWe crystallized CBADHS and TBADHS1 in order to elucidate\nthe structural basis for the observed reversal of cofactor\npreference. The resulting maps showed clear density for NAD+\nin the case of CBADHS, but only partial occupancy for TBADHS1\n(Supplementary Fig. 4). In both cases, the size of the cofactor-\nbinding pocket is reduced due to the substitution of residues 198\nand 199 by others with bulkier side chains (Fig. 3), which\nsterically prevents the binding of the 2′ phosphate of NADP. In\nthe case of CBADH S, this effect is further enhanced by the\npresence of an aspartate residue at position 198, which would also\nprevent NADP binding through electrostatic repulsion between\nthe side-chain carboxylate group and the 2′ phosphate of NADP.\nAnother common feature of both CBADHS and TBADHS1 is the\nsubstitution of Y218. The side chain of Y218 is known to undergo\na 120° rotation in the WT enzymes to allow stacking to the\nadenine moiety of NADP and the formation of a hydrogen bond\nwith the 2′ phosphate through its hydroxyl group\n29. As shown by\nthe CBADHS and TBADHS1 structures, the side chains of the\nsubstituted residues are not close enough to the 2′ phosphate to\ninteract with it, and would only be able to form hydrophobic\ninteractions with the adenine moiety, if any (Fig.3).\nSimultaneous optimization of multiple kinetic parameters by\nhigh-throughput artiﬁcial selection. Next, we applied the arti-\nﬁcial selection system to an imine reductase (IRED). IREDs are of\ngreat industrial interest thanks to their ability to catalyze the\nasymmetric reduction of imines and the reductive amination of\nketones, both of which yield chiral amines, fundamental building\nblocks in the pharmaceutical and agrichemical industries33,34. All\nknown natural IREDs are NADP dependent35, so there is great\ninterest in developing NAD-dependent variants due to the lower\ncost and higher efﬁciency of NAD-regeneration systems. The\nmost active NAD-dependent IRED thus far is MsIREDC, a variant\nof Myxococcus stipitatusIRED (MsIRED), which is able to reduce\n2-methyl-1-pyrroline amongst other substrates (Fig.4a). MsIR-\nEDC was obtained through several rounds of mutagenesis and\nscreening36. We aimed to obtain a superior NAD-dependent\nvariant of MsIRED through a faster and simpler workﬂow by\napplying the artiﬁcial selection system.\nCSR-SALAD predicted residues N32, R33, T34, and K37 to be\ncritical determinants of cofactor speciﬁcity (Fig. 4b). Thus, we\nperformed full combinatorial saturation mutagenesis of these\nresidues to generate a library (MsIREDLib) of 16.8 million unique\ngenetic variants. AL cells transformed with the library were able\nto grow anaerobically in medium with 2-methyl-1-pyrroline\n(Fig. 4c), and the same MsIRED variant (MsIREDS) was identiﬁed\nfrom three independent transformations of the library, compris-\ning residue substitutions N32D, R33V, T34R, and K37R. We\nanalyzed the fermentation broth of AL cells transformed with\nMsIREDS (Fig. 4d) by 1H-NMR, conﬁrming the consumption of\n2-methyl-1-pyrroline and the production of the corresponding\namine, 2-methylpyrrolidine (Supplementary Table 1). The\nenzymatic activities of MsIREDC and MsIREDS were compared\n(for MsIREDC, Km = 34.06 mM, kcat = 161.17 min−1 and Ki =\n4.94 mM; for MsIREDS, Km = 19.57 mM,kcat = 78.1 min−1 and\nKi = 11.42 mM; Supplementary Fig. 5, Supplementary Table 2).\nBoth variants were able to reduce 2-methyl-1-pyrroline only with\nNADH and showed substrate inhibition, as shown by the\ndecrease in activity at the highest concentrations of substrate.\nMsIREDS performed better than MsIREDC at all tested substrate\nconcentrations (Fig. 4e), partly due to the higher value of the\nsubstrate inhibition constant Ki, which indicates a relief of\nsubstrate inhibition in MsIREDS compared to MsIREDC. To our\nknowledge, MsIREDS has the highest NAD-dependent IRED\nactivity yet reported. These results highlight the ability of the\nartiﬁcial selection system to obtain variant enzymes where\nmultiple kinetic parameters are enhanced simultaneously, result-\ning in enzymes with optimal activity towards the desired\nsubstrate. Furthermore, while identi ﬁcation of MsIRED C by\nBorlinghaus and Nestl36 required multiple rounds of mutagenesis\nand screening, we obtained the superior NAD-dependent variant\nMsIREDS in a single round.\nChemically-directed evolution of enzyme variants with mod-\niﬁed chemoselectivity and positional selectivity. We aimed to\napply the artiﬁcial selection pressure to target the evolution of\nenzyme activity towards non-native chemicals. Nitroreductases\ncan synthesize aromatic hydroxylamines or amines (pharma-\nceutical and agrichemical precursors) from low-cost and readily\navailable nitroaromatics37, can activate nitroaromatic anticancer\nprodrugs38,39, and can be used for bioremediation of soils con-\ntaminated with explosives such as TNT 40,41. However, these\napplications often require the tailoring of natural nitroreductases\nto improve their catalytic properties. We targeted the classic\nEnterobacter cloacae nitroreductase NfsB (EntNfsB), a type-I\nnitroreductase able to reduce several nitroaromatic compounds,\nincluding 4-nitrobenzoic acid (4-NBA), and which can accept\nNAD and NADP as cofactors42. We characterized the activity of\nthe WT enzyme, EntNfsBWT, with 4-NBA, 4-nitrobenzyl alcohol\n(4-NBALC), and 2-nitrobenzoic acid (2-NBA),ﬁnding that it was\nable to reduce 4-NBA and 4-NBALC but not 2-NBA (Fig.5a,\nARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-27266-9\n6 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS|         (2021) 12:6859 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-27266-9 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications\nSupplementary Fig. 6, and Supplementary Table 2). The activity\ntowards 4-NBALC was, however, considerably lower than\ntowards 4-NBA, which prevented the accurate determination of\nkinetic parameters.\nWe performed full combinatorial saturation mutagenesis of\nresidues S40, T41, Y68, and F124 of EntNfsB (generating a library\n(EntNfsBLib) of 16.8 million unique genetic variants), chosen based\non their proximity to the substrate-binding pocket and their lack of\ndirect contact with the essential FMN43 (Fig. 5b). AL cells were\ntransformed with the library and cultured anaerobically in a minimal\nmedium supplemented with 2-NBA or 4-NBALC (Fig.5c, d). We\nidentiﬁed a different variant from thecells grown in the presence of\neach of the substrates. The variant selected in the cultures with\n2-NBA (EntNfsBS1) contained substitutions S40A, T41I, and F124A,\nwhile the variant selected in the cultures with 4-NBALC (EntNfsBS2)\ncontained T41L, Y68L, and F124L substitutions. In order to\ndetermine the product generated by the EnfNfsB variants, the\nfermentation broth of AL cells transformed with plasmids expressing\neither EntNfsBS1 or EntNfsBS2 and grown anaerobically in minimal\nmedium with 2-NBA or 4-NBALC (Fig.5e, f) respectively was\ncharacterized by1H-NMR (Supplementary Table 1). Interestingly,\nthe observed product signals matched those of the aromatic amines\ncorresponding to 2-NBA or 4-NBALC, despite a previous report\nindicating that EntNfsB WT can only reduce 4-NBA to\n4-hydroxylaminobenzoic acid, and not all the way to the amine\n4-aminobenzoic acid42. That report only assayed the in vivo activity\nup to 24 h. It is possible that the highly reducing conditions inside AL\ncells, combined with longer periods of incubation under anaerobic\nconditions, allow for the formation of the amine products. Enzymatic\nassays conﬁrmed that EntNfsBS1 w a sa b l et or e d u c e2 - N B A(Km =\n0.808 mM,kcat =28.4 min−1 and kcat/Km =585 M−1 s−1), and that\nEntNfsBS2 could reduce 4-NBALC more ef ﬁciently than WT\nEntNfsB, allowing determination of kinetic parameters (Km =\n1.111 mM,kcat =205.0 min−1 and kcat/Km =3075 M−1 s−1, Supple-\nmentary Fig. 6, Supplementary Table 2). Both variants retained the\nability to reduce 4-NBA. Therefore, EntNfsBS1 is active on both\n2-NBA and 4-NBA, unlike any previously reported nitroreductase.\nThe ability to engineer nitroreductase selectivity and promiscuity in\nthis way could prove useful in applications including activation of\nanticancer prodrugs with multiplenitro groups, and bioremediation\nof soils contaminated with nitroaromatics, where a complex mixture\nof different compounds is often found, and therefore the ability to act\non multiple isomers is desirable. The isolation of EntNfsBS1 and\nEntNfsBS2 demonstrates chemically-directed evolution as a powerful\napplication of the artiﬁcial selection system, using an external supply\nof target substrates to direct both improvement of an existing poor\nactivity, and acquisition of an activity with a non-native substrate.\nCoupling artiﬁcial selection to genetic design optimization\nyields the best-performing synthetic isopropanol pathway.W e\nanticipated that the artiﬁcial selection system should be readily\napplicable to more complex systems than individual enzymes,\nsuch as metabolic pathways. Furthermore, the selection pressure\nshould act not only on the sequences of enzymes, but in general\non any genetically-encoded trait that can be linked to the gen-\neration of NAD+, such as regulatory sequences controlling gene\nexpression. These sequences, particularly promoters and ribo-\nsome binding sites (RBSs), are important in the design and\noptimization of heterologous/synthetic metabolic pathways, as\nthey control the amount of each enzyme that is produced. To\nmaximize production, high yet balancedﬂux across the pathway\nis required, while avoiding the accumulation of intermediates44,45\nand expression-associated metabolic burden46. Finding the best\ncombination of regulatory elements for a speciﬁc pathway is not\ntrivial, often requiring multiple rounds of laborious and time-\nconsuming screening.\nFig. 3 Crystal structures of CBADHS and TBADHS1 reveal mechanism of cofactor selectivity reversal. aCofactor binding site of CBADHS with NAD+\nbound. The substitutions identiﬁed in CBADHS allow for the binding of NAD+ but would prevent the binding of NADP+ by steric impediments and\nelectrostatic repulsion with the side chains of D198 and Y199. Additionally, the stacked-ring interaction of the adenine moiety with Y218 observed in\nCBADHWT cannot be established due to the Y218P substitution, possibly enabling a moreﬂexible binding of the cofactor.b Cofactor binding site of\nTBADHS1, with NAD+ placed at the same position as NADP+ in the structure of TBADHWT.

As in CBADHS, the substitution of Y218 prevents the formation of a stacked-ring interaction with the adenine ring of the cofactor, possibly\nenabling a moreﬂexible binding of NAD+.\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-27266-9 ARTICLE\nNATURE COMMUNICATIONS|         (2021) 12:6859 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-27266-9 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications 7\nIsopropanol is a widely used solvent, additive, and platform\nchemical with a large market, conventionally manufactured by\npetrochemical routes. We sought to develop an isopropanol\nproduction pathway and prototype whole-cell biocatalyst superior\nto the natural and engineered examples reported previously47\n(Fig. 6a). A library (MP Lib) of variants of pathway-encoding\nplasmids, differing in the regulatory elements (promoters and\nRBSs) controlling each gene, was constructed by combinatorial\nDNA assembly using the Start-Stop Assembly48 system (Fig.6b),\ngiving a library of 60.4 million different variants. While only one\nenzyme in the pathway (CBADH) directly generates NADP+\n(converted to NAD+ by transhydrogenases), the rate depends on\nthe ﬂux through the entire pathway, which in turn depends on a\ncombination of regulatory genetic elements giving optimal\nexpression of all enzymes, without causing problematic over-\nexpression. This coupling allows the artiﬁcial selection pressure to\nbe applied to the identiﬁcation of optimal genetic designs.\nAL cells were transformed with MPLib and grown anaerobically\non minimal medium agar plates, with gluconate as a carbon\nsource instead of glucose, because the maximum theoretical yield\nof isopropanol from gluconate is greater. Colonies of transformed\nAL cells were visible after 65 h of anaerobic incubation. We\nveriﬁed the ability of 10 colonies to grow anaerobically after\ninoculating them into minimal medium liquid cultures, and\nconﬁrmed the presence of isopropanol in the fermentation broth\nby 1H-NMR (Supplementary Table 1).\nWe compared the combinations of regulatory elements and the\nisopropanol titer of 10‘S’variants obtained by artiﬁcial selection\nwith those of 10‘R’variants picked from the library at random\nwithout arti ﬁcial selection. We found only two different\ncombinations of regulatory elements among the S variants\n(MPS1 and MPS2), whereas the 10R variants were all different,\nand included defective variants lacking one or more of the genes,\nwhich can arise during DNA assembly (Fig.6b). In these minimal\nculture conditions, the S variants gave an average isopropanol\ntiter of 4.97 mM after 17 h of incubation, which was signiﬁcantly\ngreater (t(9) = 9.22 and p = 1.54 × 10−8, or excluding defective\nvariants t(9) = 6.82 and p = 4.19 × 10−6) than the average of\n0.60 mM produced by the R variants (Fig.6b). This indicates that\nthe artiﬁcial selection pressure had acted both to eliminate\ndefective variants and to favour speciﬁc combinations of genetic\nelements leading to maximized production of isopropanol.\nWe compared the performance of the best isopropanol\npathway variant MP S1 with the best isopropanol pathway\nreported previously, by Hanai and coworkers47, using the same\ngrowth medium and culture conditions. The previous best 43.5%\nof maximum theoretical isopropanol yield during the production\nphase (with 45 mM titre) was surpassed here by WTE. coli cells\ntransformed with MPS1, which achieved 56% at the same point\n(with 62 mM titre), the highest isopropanol yield reported so far\nfor any organism, including both native producers and\nengineered strains.\nFig. 4 Selection of an imine reductase with reversed cofactor selectivity and minimized substrate inhibition. aReaction catalyzed by MsIRED\n(Myxococcus stipitatus imine reductase).

Automated chemical synthesis can readily provide DNA\nencoding arbitrary protein sequences, so identifying novel func-\ntionalities in protein sequence space is effectively solely a search\nproblem. Searches of such astronomically large and highly mul-\ntidimensional design spaces cannot be exhaustive, so success is a\nfunction of start points, search strategies, and throughput; as well\nas the structure of the space.\nNatural evolution and laboratory evolution alike use existing\nproteins as start points, and generate new functional proteins by\nmodest numbers of modiﬁcations. Initiating searches for new\nFig. 6 Selection of an isopropanol production pathway with optimized regulatory elements. aA synthetic isopropanol production pathway forE. coli.\nThiolase (acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase) THL (encoded byatoB) catalyzes the condensation of two acetyl-CoA molecules to one acetoacetyl-CoA,\nreleasing one free CoA molecule. Acetoacetyl-CoA transferase ACoAT (comprising two subunits encoded byatoA and atoD) transfers the CoA group from\nacetoacetyl-CoA to acetate, yielding acetoacetate and acetyl-CoA. Acetoacetate is decarboxylated by acetoacetate decarboxylase ADC (encoded byadc),\nresulting in acetone and CO2. Finally, acetone is reduced to isopropanol by CBADH. The acetate consumed by ACoAT can be regenerated from the\nresulting acetyl-CoA by phosphate acetyltransferase PTA and acetate kinase ACK. The NADP+ generated during the reduction of acetone can be\nemployed by transhydrogenases STHA and PNTA to regenerate the NAD+ required to sustain anaerobic growth.b A library of isopropanol pathway-\nencoding plasmids was combinatorially assembled using mixtures of promoters and RBSs, expected to cause a diversity of performance in terms ofﬂux,\naccumulation of intermediates, and expression-associated metabolic burden. 10‘S’ pathway variants were isolated by redox selection inE. coliAL cells and\n10 ‘R’ pathway variants were isolated at random. Sequencing was used to determine the parts present in each case, which are shown aligned below the\ncorresponding part in the design. Only two different permutations of parts were identiﬁed among the S variants, whereas all 10R variants were unique. Two\nR variants were defective, lacking one or more expected parts, whereas all S variants were complete. For comparison of isopropanol production, AL cells\ncontaining the S and R variants were cultured in M9 glucose medium for 17 h, then individual and average isopropanol titers in culture broths of both\ngroups were determined. For both variants obtained by selection and variants picked at random,n = 10 biologically independent samples. In each set, black\nbars represent individual biological replicates, and the red bar represents the mean value with standard deviation indicated by the error bar obtained from\nthe corresponding set of individual biological replicates.

However, it also means\nthat ‘new’ proteins are very similar to their parents. In this\ncontext, new functional proteins identiﬁed from metagenomic\nresources49 also represent additional start points to access new\nregions of sequence space. It is not currently possible to make\nlarge jumps in sequence space to islands of functionality distant\nfrom the natural repertoire, a limitation that might be overcome\nby the future development ofde novo enzyme design, allowing\nexotic and truly novel proteins to be identiﬁed. In this direction,\nartiﬁcial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are already\nbeing applied to directed evolution and protein engineering50,51.\nEncouraging progress towards solving the 50-year-old protein\nfolding problem has recently been made using AI52, although\npredicting function is much more difﬁcult. When developing new\nor improved enzyme activities, there is currently no substitute for\nexperimental evaluation, so throughput is key.\nIsolation and screening of variants using robotic automation is\nthe current state of the art in protein engineering, but remains\nmuch slower than library generation, so is usually the bottleneck.\nTechnologies like FACS and micro ﬂuidics achieve higher\nthroughputs, but are less widely applicable. Artiﬁcial selection\nprovides the highest throughput, because variants do not need to\nbe physically separated for individual evaluation, and in some\ncases because beneﬁcial mutations can continuously accumulate\nwithout intervention. Selection is part of classical strain\nimprovement53, a longstanding approach re-popularized in\nrecent years, with the beneﬁt of modern genome sequencing, as\nAdaptive Laboratory Evolution (ALE) 54. Over time, arti ﬁcial\nselections6 have enabled powerful technologies, with limited\nscopes, including Systematic Evolution of Ligands by Exponential\nEnrichment (SELEX)55,56 for generation of high-afﬁnity binding\naptamers, Compartmentalized Self-Replication (CSR) 57 for\ndirected evolution of DNA polymerases, and Phage-Assisted\nContinuous Evolution (PACE)58, which supports selection of\nfactors linked to gene expression.\nPrevious studies have shown that E. coli cells with defective\nanaerobic fermentation can be used to select redox-active\nenzymes or pathways acting on substrates connected to native\nmetabolism8–11,13. Here, we have demonstrated that such a\nmetabolic defect can be exploited as an unusually widely applic-\nable selection system acting on metabolically isolated enzymes by\nproviding an external electron acceptor in the culture medium.\nThe outcome of the selection can be directly controlled by simply\nreplacing the externally provided substrate, enabling an easily-\ntunable, chemically-driven selection system. The selection pres-\nsure acts directly on NAD+ regeneration, so is directly applicable\nto NAD-dependent oxidoreductases, a very large class of\nenzymes59. The diverse viable growth rates observed among\nselected variants and controls, and diverse kinetic parameters\namong selected variants, indicate that the selection has a wide\ndynamic range. Furthermore, the selection is highly amenable to\nextension through coupling. This ﬁrst study includes optional\ncoupling to NADP-dependent activities via transhydrogenases;\ncoupling to non-redox enzymes (in the isopropanol pathway\nhere, but many pathways and cascades contain at least one\nNAD(P)H-dependent step); and coupling to genetic design,\nillustrating the broad scope of selection, not limited to protein\nsequences. These results demonstrate that the system will be\napplicable to diverse problems in industrial biotechnology, and\nespecially in biocatalysis.\nDirect applications of examples described here include the\ndevelopment of alcohol dehydrogenases (ketoreductases) for\nproduction of chiral alcohols60, imine reductases (especially the\nsubset with reductive aminase activity) for production of chiral\namines61, and development of isopropanol-producing microbial\nstrains. The artiﬁcial selection could be applied widely in the\nﬁelds represented by these speciﬁc examples; the development of\nenzymes and cascades for the synthesis of pharmaceutical and\nagrichemical precursors, and whole-cell biocatalysts required for\nsustainable biomanufacture of commodity chemicals. Besides\nlaboratory development, nature is still a very important source of\nbiocatalysts\n49. Identifying new enzymes from metagenomic\nsources is conceptually similar to identifying desired variants\nfrom synthetic libraries, and the selection is well suited to both.\nThe great throughput provided by artiﬁcial selection is more\nthan a ‘brute force’ alternative to computational design: The\nlibraries in this study are too large to screen by conventional\nmethods, but cutting library sizes requires assumptions. For\nexample, the CBADH and TBADH variants which outcompeted\nall others (and previous reports) under selection pressure were\nnot part of the much smaller computationally-designed libraries.\nFurthermore, the capacity to include an additional residue in the\ninitial design obviated subsequent recovery of activity.\nEven the throughput provided by artiﬁcial selection is not a\npanacea given the size of protein sequence space. It will be very\npowerful to combine selection with AI/ML approaches, iteratively\nusing AI/ML for library design and artiﬁcial selection to rapidly\nsearch libraries, and hence rapidly progress through design space.\nArtiﬁcial selection could be coupled to an in vivo mutagenesis\nsystem, such as OrthoRep 62 or eMutaT763, to achieve fully\nautomated and continuous in vivo evolution. In time, these\napproaches will support the transition from the fossil economy to\nthe sustainable, circular bioeconomy, inform protein and enzyme\ndesign principles, and ultimately enable the development ofde\nnovo design of enzymes and other systems.\nMethods\nConstruction ofE. coli mutant strains. E. coli strain JW1228, theΔadhE mutant\nfrom the Keio collection64, was used as the starting point for construction of\nmultiple strains. The pMAK705 allele exchange method65 was used to construct the\nAL (ΔadhE ΔldhA), ALP (ΔadhE ΔldhA ΔpntA), ALS (ΔadhE ΔldhA ΔsthA) and\nALPS (ΔadhE ΔldhA ΔpntA ΔsthA) strains; using pMAK70565-derived plasmids\ntargeting ldhA (pLS63), pntA (pLS40) andsthA (pLS39) (Supplementary Table 3).\nBrieﬂy, cells were transformed by heat shock at 37 °C, plated onto LB agar plates\nwith chloramphenicol, and incubated at 30 °C. Single colonies were used to\ninoculate LB medium with chloramphenicol, and incubated at 30 °C overnight.\nSerial dilutions prepared from the overnight cultures were plated onto LB agar\nplates with chloramphenicol and incubated at 44 °C (the non-permissive tem-\nperature for replication of these plasmids) with chloramphenicol selection to isolate\nsingle crossover (cointegrate) clones, then subcultured and incubated at 30 °C (the\npermissive temperature) without selection to allow cointegrate resolution and to\nallow the arising double crossover clones to grow, andﬁnally subcultured and\nincubated at 44 °C without selection to eliminate the plasmid. Mutants were ver-\niﬁed by antibiotic resistance proﬁle and PCR screening of the target locus. Firstly,\npLS63 was used to derive the AL strain from JW1228. The AL strain was then\nsubjected to the same protocol with pLS40 or pLS39, yielding strains ALP and ALS,\nrespectively. Finally, ALS was treated with pLS40 to obtain the quadruple mutant\nstrain ALPS.\nConstruction of plasmids. Plasmids are listed in Supplementary Table 3. Oligo-\nnucleotides are listed in Supplementary Table 4.E. coliDH5α was used as a cloning\nhost. Restriction digestion and ligation reactions were performed as recommended\nby the manufacturer (New England Biolabs). All constructed plasmids were iso-\nlated and veriﬁed by sequencing.\nSequences encoding ADHE (AIN31697.1 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/\nAIN31697.1]) and BDHA (CAB12443.1 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/protein/\nCAB12443.1]) were PCR-ampliﬁed from genomic DNA ofE. coliBW25113\nand Bacillus subtilis168, respectively.

For EntNfsB, the pUC19 vector backbone was PCR ampliﬁed with primers\nintroducing BbsI restriction sites. The pUC19 PCR product was mixed with the\nsynthetic sequence encoding EntNfsB and assembled in a Golden Gate reaction in the\npresence of DpnI. Golden Gate reactions were performed in a total reaction volume of\n20 μL in 1 × T4 DNA ligase buffer, comprising 50 fmol of backbone (linearized pUC19\nwith BbsI restriction sites obtained as described above), 50 fmol of the DNA fragment\nto be cloned, 1 U/μL of BbsI-HF restriction enzyme and 20 U/μL of T4 DNA ligase. The\nreaction mixture was then incubated in a thermocycler with 30 cycles alternating 5 min\nsteps at 37 °C with 5 min steps at 16 °C, before performing a singleﬁnal deactivation\nstep at 65 °C for 20 min. pLS131, encoding the previously-reported\n36 MsIREDC variant,\nwas generated by inverse PCR using pLS130(encoding WT MsIRED) as template and\nprimers designed to introduce the appropriate substitutions (N32E, R33Y, T34E, K37R,\nL67I, and T71V) followed by self-ligation of the PCR product using T4 DNA ligase. To\nconstruct plasmids for expression of hexahistidine-tagged versions of MsIRED,\nEntNfsB, and their variants, the coding sequences were PCR-ampliﬁed using primers\ncontaining a C-terminal hexahistidine tag and BbsI restriction sites (Supplementary\nTable 5). The resulting PCR products were mixed with pUC19 vector backbone\npreviously PCR-ampliﬁed with primers introducing BbsI restriction sites and used to\nperform a Golden Gate assembly reaction as described above. To construct plasmids for\nexpression of hexahistidine-tagged versions of CBADH, TBADH, and their variants,\ncoding sequences were ampliﬁed by PCR using primers designed to introduce NdeI and\nBlpI restriction sites. PCR products and the pET28 vector were digested using NdeI and\nBlpI, and the appropriate puriﬁed fragments were ligated using T4 DNA ligase,\nresulting in pET28-derived plasmidse n c o d i n ge n z y m e sw i t hN - t e r m i n a l\nhexahistidine tags.\nTo construct allele exchange directed mutagenesis plasmids derived from\npMAK705, two 500 bp sequences, one upstream and one downstream of the target\ngene, were PCR-ampliﬁed from genomic DNA ofE. coli BW25113. The resulting\nPCR products were fused using overlap extension PCR using primers incorporating\nBamHI and HindIII sites. The product of the overlap extension PCR was digested\nwith BamHI and HindIII, and ligated with linearized pMAK705 (obtained by\ntreating pMAK705 with BamHI and HindIII) using T4 DNA ligase.\nPrediction of residues involved in nicotinamide cofactor preference. CSR-\nSALAD\n25 with standard parameters was used to predict residues important in\ndetermining the nicotinamide cofactor preference of CBADH, TBADH, and\nMsIRED. The inputs were the available crystal structures for CBADH and TBADH\n(PDB codes 1KEV [https://doi.org/10.2210/pdb1KEV/pdb] and 1YKF [https://\ndoi.org/10.2210/pdb1YKF/pdb], respectively), or a homology model of MsIRED\ngenerated with SWISS-MODEL66 using the crystal structure ofStreptomyces\nkanamyceticus imine reductase as starting model (PDB code 3ZHB [https://doi.org/\n10.2210/pdb3ZHB/pdb]).\nConstruction of full combinatorial saturation mutagenesis libraries. Libraries\nof variants of CBADH, TBADH, MsIRED, and EntNfsB were generated by full\ncombinatorial saturation mutagenesis of the targeted positions using either inverse\nPCR (for CBADH and TBADH) or Golden Gate assembly (for MsIRED and\nEntNfsB). For inverse PCR reactions, a pair of primers were designed for each\nreaction, with degenerate N mixtures of nucleotides at each position targeted for\nsaturation mutagenesis. The 5′ end of one primer in each pair was phosphorylated\n(Supplementary Table 4). The reactions were carried out with Phusion High-\nFidelity DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs) using as template the pUC19-\nderived expression plasmid for each parental coding sequence, described above.\nThe reactions were performed according to the manufacturer’s instructions in a\ntotal volume of 50μL. PCR products were treated with DpnI, puriﬁed, and cir-\ncularized by self-ligation with T4 DNA ligase. For Golden Gate assembly\nreactions\n67, ﬁrst the pUC19 vector backbone was ampliﬁed by PCR with primers\nwith overhangs designed to incorporate matching BbsI restriction sites. The parent\ncoding sequences were ampliﬁed with one or more pairs of primers containing\ndegenerate N mixtures of nucleotides at the positions targeted for saturation\nmutagenesis and overhangs matching the corresponding BbsI restriction sites. The\nresulting PCR ampliﬁed fragments contained the targeted positions and covered\nthe entire coding sequence, such that assembly would lead to libraries of full-length\ncoding sequences. The ampliﬁed vector backbone and PCR fragments were used to\ncarry out a Golden Gate assembly reaction in the presence of DpnI as previously\ndescribed. Successful genetic diversiﬁcation was veriﬁed by sequencing 10 random\nisolated clones of each library, obtaining in all cases 10 different sequences (Sup-\nplementary Tables 6−9).\nConstruction of the library of isopropanol production pathways. The atoB,\natoD, andatoA coding sequences were obtained by PCR ampliﬁcation fromE. coli\nstrain BW25113 genomic DNA. Theadc coding sequence was obtained by PCR\nampliﬁcation from Clostridium acetobutylicum ATCC 824 genomic DNA. The\nsequence encoding CBADH (cbadh) was obtained by PCR ampliﬁcation from the\npLS6 plasmid. In all cases, primers designed to introduce BsaI overhangs\nwere used.\nIndividual parts, expression units, and full metabolic pathways were constructed\nby hierarchical Start-Stop Assembly\n48. Firstly, functional genetic parts were cloned\nin the Level 0 storage plasmid pStA0 by mixing the PCR ampliﬁed fragments with\nBsaI-digested vector and ligating with T4 DNA ligase. Level 0 mixtures of six\ndifferent promoters and 6 different RBSs (described previously48) were prepared as\nequimolar mixtures of the plasmids containing these parts. Libraries of Level 1\nplasmids (each containing whole expression units comprising a promoter, an RBS,\na functional gene, and a transcriptional terminator) were obtained by Start-Stop\nAssembly reactions. For each functional gene, the reaction was performed in a total\nreaction volume of 20μL in 1 × T4 DNA ligase buffer, and included 20 fmol of the\ndestination vector (pStA1AB, pStA1BC, pStA1CD, pStA1DE or pStA1EZ), 40 fmol\nof the mixture of Level 0 plasmids carrying promoters, 40 fmol of the mixture of\nLevel 0 plasmids carrying RBSs, 40 fmol of Level 0 plasmid carrying the\ncorresponding gene, 40 fmol of Level 0 plasmid carrying a terminator out of four\ndifferent possibilities (as shown in Supplementary Table 3), T4 DNA ligase buffer,\n20 U/μL of T4 DNA ligase and 0.5 U/μL of SapI. The reaction mixture was\nincubated using a thermocycler for 30 cycles of 37 °C for 5 min and 16 °C for 5 min,\nbefore a singleﬁnal step of deactivation at 65 °C for 20 min. The resulting products\nwere used to transformE. coli DH5α cells, and plasmid DNA was isolated. The\nLevel 2 library (containing variants of the full metabolic pathway differing in the\ncombination of promoters and RBSs) was generated with similar Start-Stop\nAssembly reactions, but the BsaI restriction enzyme was used instead of SapI.\nAnaerobic cultures. E. coli AL, ALS, ALP, or ALPS cells were transformed with\nindividual plasmids encoding WT enzymes or variants, or plasmid libraries\nencoding variants of enzymes or variants of pathways. Transformed cells were\ntransferred into 15 mL of M9 medium and incubated aerobically at 30 °C for 6 h to\nrecover. Recovered transformant cells were then used at a 1:100 dilution to\ninoculate anaerobic M9 media containing 18 mM glucose or (where stated) glu-\nconate, 100μg/mL ampicillin or 50μg/mL kanamycin as appropriate, 1 mM IPTG,\nand an external substrate as appropriate (Supplementary Table 10). Anaerobic\ncultures were incubated in a Don Whitley Scientiﬁc A35 anaerobic workstation\ncontaining anaerobic growth gas mix (10% CO\n2, 10% H2, and 80% N2). The culture\nmedium was made anaerobic by placing it in the anaerobic workstation for 24 h\nbefore inoculation. Growth was monitored by measuring OD600. In all growth\ncomplementation experiments, cells transformed with pLS1 encodingE. coliADHE\nwere used as the positive control, and cells transformed with empty vector pUC19\nwere used as the negative control.\nFor artiﬁcial selection experiments performed with enzyme variant libraries,\nafter the plateau phase of growth was reached, cells were subcultured under the\nsame selective conditions to select variants supporting growth, and to dilute out\nother variants. Selected variants were isolated by culturing samples of the grown\ncells on LB agar plates containing the appropriate antibiotic and picking single\ncolonies, which were sequenced to identify the variant.\nFor artiﬁcial selection on the solid medium of the library of variants of the\nisopropanol pathway MP\nLib, AL cells transformed with the library were plated onto\nanaerobic M9 minimal medium agar plates supplemented with 18 mM gluconate,\n50 μg/mL kanamycin, and 1 mM IPTG. The plates were made anaerobic by placing\nthem in the anaerobic workstation for 24 h before plating cells.\nGrowth curves were generated using GraphPad PRISM byﬁtting a Gompertz\ngrowth equation to the OD\n600 values measured at different time points.\nEvaluation of isopropanol pathway variants. E. coli AL cells were transformed\nwith MPLib and plated on both aerobic and anaerobic M9 minimal medium agar\nplates supplemented with 18 mM gluconate, 50μg/mL kanamycin, and 1 mM\nIPTG. The redox selection pressure acts under anaerobic conditions. Plasmid DNA\nwas isolated from 10 colonies from the aerobic plates (random‘R’variants) and 10\ncolonies from the anaerobic plates (selected‘S’variants). Puriﬁed plasmids were\nsequenced and used to retransformE. coli AL cells. To compare isopropanol\nproduction among these clones (Fig.6), transformed cells were used to inoculate\nM9 minimal medium supplemented with 18 mM gluconate, 50μg/mL kanamycin,\nand 1 mM IPTG and incubated aerobically for 17 h at 37 °C and 250 rpm shaking,\nafter which cultures were centrifuged and the supernatant was analyzed by\n1H-NMR. The isopropanol titers were compared by performing a one-tailed t-test,\nand a large effect size was conﬁrmed by calculating Cohen’sD( D = 4.123, or\nexcluding defective variantsD = 3.519). Statistical tests were performed in R.\nIn order to compare the isopropanol production of MPS1 (the best isopropanol\npathway variant obtained by artiﬁcial selection in this study) with a previous\nreport47, the culture conditions used in that previous report were replicated.E. coli\nBW25113 cells were transformed with pLS60_1, encoding pathway variant MPS1.\nTransformed cells were plated onto LB agar plates supplemented with 50μg/mL\nkanamycin and incubated aerobically overnight at 37 °C. Individual colonies were\npicked and used to inoculate precultures of 5 mL SD-7 medium\n47 with 111 mM\nglucose. Cells were cultured aerobically for 17 h at 37 °C and 250 rpm shaking.\nThen, 250μL of the preculture was used to inoculate 25 mL of SD-8 medium47 with\n111 mM glucose in 250 mLﬂasks with bafﬂes. After culturing cells aerobically for\n9 h (because the previous study47 reported yield at this point, due to it being the\nmost productive phase of the culture) at 37 °C and 250 rpm shaking, the\nisopropanol titer in the culture broth was determined by1H-NMR. All cultures\nwere supplemented with 50μg/mL kanamycin.\nARTICLE NATURE COMMUNICATIONS | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-27266-9\n12 NATURE COMMUNICATIONS|         (2021) 12:6859 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-021-27266-9 | www.nature.com/naturecommunications\nAnalysis of culture broths by1H-NMR. Samples of cultures were centrifuged for\n15 min at 8000 × g to pellet the cells. 0.5 mL of each supernatant was removed and\nmixed with 0.5 mL of NMR buffer (75 mM Na2HPO4 buffer at pH 7.4, 4.6 mM 3-\n(trimethylsilyl)-[2,2,3,3-2H4]-propionate (TSP) and 20% (v/v) D2O). The resulting\nsolution was transferred into a 3 mm NMR tube. 1D1H-NMR spectra were\nacquired with TopSpin 3 on a Bruker Avance III 400 MHz spectrometer operating\nat 293 K using the zg30 pulse sequence. A total of 16 scans for each sample were\ncollected into 32,768 data points with a spectral window of 20 ppm. Additionally,\nfor each metabolite of interest, spectra of M9 medium supplemented with 10 mM\nof the metabolite were acquired in order to determine characteristic peaks of each\nmetabolite (Supplementary Table 11 and Supplementary Fig. 7). The spectra were\nprocessed with the MestReNova suite. After performing phase and baseline cor-\nrection, spectra were calibrated to the TSP signal atδ 0 ppm. Metabolite assign-\nment was conﬁrmed with spiking experiments. The concentration of each\nmetabolite of interest was calculated by integrating the characteristic signal of each\ncompound and comparing it to the area of the signal corresponding to TSP, taking\ninto account the different number of protons corresponding to each signal. For\neach analysis, metabolite concentrations were measured in each of three inde-\npendent replicate cultures, and the mean of these values was determined.\nNickel-afﬁnity chromatography puriﬁcation of hexahistidine-tagged enzymes.\nE. coli BL21(DE3) cells were transformed with pET28a or pUC19 expression\nplasmids encoding hexahistidine-tagged proteins, allowed to recover at 37 °C for\n1 h, then plated on LB agar plates supplemented with 50μg/mL kanamycin or\n100 μg/mL ampicillin and incubated at 37 °C to select transformants. Individual\ncolonies were inoculated in 10 mL of LB broth with 50μg/mL kanamycin or\n100 μg/mL ampicillin and cultured overnight at 37 °C and 230 rpm. Cells were then\ninoculated at a 1:1000 ratio in LB with 50μg/mL kanamycin or 100μg/mL\nampicillin and incubated at 37 °C and 230 rpm until an OD\n600 of 0.6 was reached.\nThen, protein expression was induced with 400μM IPTG and incubated overnight\nat 18 °C and 230 rpm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 × g for 30 min\nat 4 °C and resuspended in 50 mL of puriﬁcation buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH\n7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 10% (w/v) glycerol and 1 mM TCEP) supplemented with Base\nMuncher DNAse, lysozyme, one cOmplete Protease Inhibitor Tablet per liter of\nculture and, in the case of nitroreductases, 100μM ﬂavin mononucleotide (FMN).\nAfter lysing cells by ultrasonication, the lysate was centrifuged at 21,000 × g for 1 h\nat 4 °C to pellet cell debris. The supernatant wasﬁltered through a 0.21μm ﬁlter\nand loaded onto a 5 mL HisTrap column (GE HealthCare). The column was\nextensively washed with puriﬁcation buffer and eluted with a gradient of\n25–500 mM imidazole. Eluted fractions were tested for enzymatic activity, and\nthose containing the activity of interest were pooled and subjected to gelﬁltration\nin a Superdex 200 column (GE HealthCare) in buffer containing 50 mM Tris-HCl\nat pH 7.4 and 150 mM NaCl. The purity of peak fractions was assessed by means of\nSDS-PAGE. Additionally, for nitroreductase enzymes the presence of pure FMN-\nbound holoprotein was determined based on a A280/A454 ratio lower than 5.\nPuriﬁed proteins were concentrated to 40–80 μM, ﬂash frozen with liquid nitrogen,\nand stored at−80 °C. All puriﬁcation steps were carried out with an ÄKTA pure\nchromatography system (GE HealthCare).\nEnzymatic activity assays. Enzymatic assays at different substrate concentrations\nwere performed at 37 °C with puriﬁed protein by monitoring NAD(P)H absor-\nbance at 340 nm or 370 nm with an Eppendorf BioSpectrometer kinetic instru-\nment. Assays were performed anaerobically for EntNfsB and its variants and\naerobically for all other enzymes. All reactions were performed in a total volume of\n200 μL for aerobic reactions and 400μL for anaerobic reactions, with protein\nconcentration ranging between 26 nM and 1.3μM and saturating concentrations of\ncofactor (Supplementary Table 12). Oxidation reactions were performed in assay\nbuffer A (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 8.8 and 50 mM NaCl), while reduction reactions\nwere carried out in assay buffer B (50 mM Tris-HCl at pH 7.4 and 50 mM NaCl).\nReaction rates were determined using the initial linear rates. These were calculated\nfrom the change in absorbance using the known molar absorption coefﬁcients\n42 of\nNADH and NADPH at 340 nm ofε340 = 6.22 × 103 M−1 cm−1 and of NADH at\n370 nm ofε370 = 2.66 × 103 M−1 cm−1. Triplicate measurements were acquired for\nall initial reaction rates. For all reactions except those catalyzed by EntNfsB and its\nvariants, equimolar amounts of cofactor and substrate are consumed as the reac-\ntion progresses, and thus the consumption of cofactor was directly converted to\nconsumption of substrate. For reactions catalyzed by EntNfsB and its variants, the\nsubstrates were assumed to be reduced only to the corresponding hydroxylamines,\ndue to previous reports indicating that the WT enzyme does not catalyze the\nreduction to amines in vitro\n42. Additionally, the reduction from the nitroso\nintermediate to the corresponding hydroxylamine was assumed to happen\nimmediately. As a consequence, and considering that both the reduction to a\nnitroso compound and to a hydroxylamine require 2 NADH, calculations were\nperformed on the basis of 4 mol of cofactor being consumed for each consumed\nmol of the substrate. Kinetic parameters were obtained byﬁtting a Michaelis-\nMenten model with GraphPad Prism, including substrate inhibition in the model\nwhen a reduction of initial rates was observed at higher substrate concentrations.\nCrystallization and structure solution. Puriﬁed CBADH\nS and TBADHS1 were\nconcentrated to ~10 mg/mL for crystallization with sitting drop vapour diffusion at\n17 °C using commercial sparse matrix screens with a Mosquito robot (TTPLab-\nTech). Crystallization hits were detected with a light-UV microscope and further\noptimized in manually set up hanging drop vapour diffusion experiments. Final\nCBADH\nS crystals came from 900 mM sodium citrate, 100 mM imidazole at pH 8\nmixed with an equal volume of protein solution. Final TBADHS1 crystals came\nfrom 20% (w/v) PEG 3 K and 100 mM sodium citrate at pH 5.5 mixed with an\nequal volume of protein solution. Crystals were soaked in the corresponding\nmother liquor with 1 mM NAD\n+, then cryoprotected for several minutes in mother\nliquor with 30% volume PEG 400 andﬂash-cooled in liquid nitrogen. X-ray dif-\nfraction data were collected at the Diamond Light Source synchrotron (Didcot,\nUK), and processed with the xia2 pipeline68 using AutoPROC69. Structures were\nsolved by molecular replacement in Phaser70 using PDB 1KEV [https://doi.org/\n10.2210/pdb1KEV/pdb]71 as a model for CBADHS and PDB 1YKF [https://doi.org/\n10.2210/pdb1YKF/pdb]29 for TBADHS1. The models were rebuilt in Coot72 with\ncycles of reﬁnement in phenix.reﬁne73, and validated with MolProbity74. Data\ncollection and reﬁnement information are presented in Supplementary Table 13.\nReporting summary.

{"text": "Reductive aminations by imine reductases: from\nmilligrams to tons\nAmelia K. Gilio,a Thomas W. Thorpe,b Nicholas Turner *b and Gideon Grogan *a\nThe synthesis of secondary and tertiary amines through the reductive amination of carbonyl compounds is\none of the most signiﬁcant reactions in synthetic chemistry. Asymmetric reductive amination for the\nformation of chiral amines, which are required for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals and other bioactive\nmolecules, is often achieved through transition metal catalysis, but biocatalytic methods of chiral amine\nproduction have also been a focus of interest owing to their selectivity and sustainability. The discovery\nof asymmetric reductive amination by imine reductase (IRED) and reductive aminase (RedAm) enzymes\nhas served as the starting point for a new industrial approach to the production of chiral amines, leading\nfrom laboratory-scale milligram transformations to ton-scale reactions that are now described in the\npublic domain. In this perspective we trace the development of the IRED-catalyzed reductive amination\nreaction from its discovery to its industrial application on kg to ton scale. In addition to surveying\nexamples of the synthetic chemistry that has been achieved with the enzymes, the contribution of\nstructure and protein engineering to the understanding of IRED-catalyzed reductive amination is\ndescribed, and the consequent beneﬁts for activity, selectivity and stability in the design of process\nsuitable catalysts.\nIntroduction\nThe synthesis of chiral amines is of signicant importance to\nthe pharmaceutical and agrochemical industry as this group is\nwidely distributed amongst the most used bioactive compounds\nin the world.\n1,2 Their synthesis is oen accomplished through\nreductive amination, 3 in which an amine is reacted with\na ketone partner to form an intermediate hemiaminal, which\nthen loses water to give an imine that is subsequently reduced\nto the corresponding amine (in the case of primary and\nsecondary amine formations, the major focus of this perspec-\ntive, Scheme 1).\n3\nHigh optical purity is crucial for active pharmaceutical\ningredient (API) manufacture and therefore a wide variety of\nreaction systems has been developed for asymmetric reductive\namination to form chiral amines.\nAsymmetric reductive amination is o en accomplished\nusing organocatalysis\n4–6 or chiral transition metal (TM)-based\ncatalysis.7–10 In an early example of the latter, Blaser showed\nthat the precursor1a of the herbicide (S)-metolachlor could be\nsynthesized from methoxyacetone 1 with 2-methyl-5-\nethylaniline a and hydrogen using an iridium catalyst\ngenerated in situ from 2, giving the amine product (S)-1a with\n78% e.e. (Scheme 2).11\nMore recently, Verzijl and co-workers at Innosyn used\na dynamic kinetic resolution-asymmetric reductive amination\nmediated by iridium catalyst4 to synthesize a precursor of the\nrheumatoid arthritis treatment, tofacitinib.12 Using this reac-\ntion system, racemic ketone3 was coupled with methylamine\nb using hydrogen, to give the (3R,4R)-amine product3b in 86%\nisolated yield with 95% d.e. and 72% e.e. However, challenges\nremain for the general application of TM-catalyzed reductive\namination, such as imperfect stereoselectivity, gaps in amine\nand ketone scope, as well as inhibition by amine derived\nintermediates.\nGiven the increasing pressure on the chemical industry to\ndevelop more sustainable routes to bioactive molecules, there\nhas also been signicant interest in developing biocatalytic\nmethods for chiral amine production.\n13,14 Focusing on enzymes\nScheme 1 The asymmetric synthesis of chiral secondary aminesvia\nhemiaminal and imine formation by reductive amination (adapted\nfrom ref. 3).\naDepartment of Chemistry, University of York, Heslington, York YO10 5DD, UK.

{"text": "that perform reductive aminations, whether formal or direct,\nthere are essentiallyve types that are of interest for their ability\nto transform prochiral ketones to chiral amines (A to E, Scheme\n3 and Table 1). Therst of these areu-transaminases (u-TAs,\nScheme 3A),\n15,16 which convert ketones to amines through the\nuse of an amine donor, such asL-alanine or isopropylamine5.\nThis amine donor is used by u-TAs to aminate the cofactor\npyridoxal phosphate (PLP) to pyridoxamine-5-monophosphate\n(PMP), with subsequent transfer of the amino group on PMP\nto the ketone substrate.u-TAs have been the focus of a large\namount of research in the last twenty years, including process\nimprovements that combine protein and reaction engineering\nenabling large-scale industrial processes\n17,18 despite the need\nfor excess amine donor to create a favourable reaction equilib-\nrium. Additionally, a key limitation ofu-TA catalysis is that only\nprimary amines can be synthesized and therefore secondary\namine targets must be prepared through further elaboration.\nThe second type of enzyme that catalyzes reductive amina-\ntion is the amine dehydrogenases (AmDHs).\n19,20 AmDHs cata-\nlyze the direct reductive coupling of ketones with ammonia by\nforming an imine intermediate that is subsequently reduced by\nthe biological hydride transfer agent NAD(P)H (Scheme 3B).\nEnzymes that catalyze the reductive amination ofa-keto acids to\na-amino acids (Amino Acid Dehydrogenases, AADHs) using this\nmechanism are well characterised, including,L-leucine21 and L-\nphenylalanine22 dehydrogenases (LeuDH and PheDH respec-\ntively). The simplicity of this route prompted protein engi-\nneering of LeuDH, targeted at altering the carboxylate binding\npocket of the enzyme, and yielded a mutant for the enantiose-\nlective reductive amination of the aliphatic methyl isobutyl\nketone (MIBK, 7) to give (R)-1,3-dimethylbutylamine 8 with\n99.8% e.e.\n23 There are now numerous reports detailing the\nsubsequent evolution and application of engineered\nAmDHs,\n24–26 which make use of other AADH scaﬀolds including\nPheDH and also an3-deaminating L-lysine dehydrogenase (LE-\nAmDH),27,28 for the transformation of non-native substrates.\nMore recently, a family of naturally occurring AmDHs was\nidentied,29,30 that could transform simple ketones to amines\nusing ammonia. These studies will prompt further screening\nand evolution eﬀorts to expand the available substrate scope of\nAmDHs. The application of NAD(P)H-dependent AmDHs is\nattractive from an industrial perspective, given the simple\nnature of the amine donor, and also the use of nicotinamide\ncofactors, as technology for their implementation is well-\nestablished for the industrial exploitation of ketoreductase\n(KRED) enzymes.\n31 AmDHs are a valuable resource for the\nasymmetric amination of ketones, however, excluding a few\nrecent exceptions,\n32,33 the product scope is limited to primary\namines.\nA third type of enzyme, opine dehydrogenases (OpDHs),\nwhich in Nature couplea-keto acids and ana-amino acids to\nform dipeptides,34 can also be engineered for the coupling of\naliphatic ketones with primary aliphatic amines, in this case to\nform secondary amine products (Scheme 3C). For example,9c\ncould be synthesized from 5-methoxy-2-tetralone 9 and n-\nbutylamine c using a variant ofN-(1-D-carboxyethyl)-L-norvaline\ndehydrogenase (CENDH) obtained by directed evolution.35\nNotwithstanding the discovery and application of engi-\nneered OpDHs, which does not appear to have been further\nexplored by academic groups, the reductive amination of\nketones to form chiral secondary amines, using alkylamine\npartners as co-substrates, remained both an attractive goal and\na challenge for biocatalysis. In recent years this challenge has\nbeen met through the discovery and development of the fourth\ntype of enzymes, the NAD(P)H-dependent imine reductases\n(IREDs),\n36,37 which catalyze the asymmetric reduction of cyclic\nimines such as 2-methylpyrroline10 (Scheme 3D). IREDs can\nalso enable the reductive amination of carbonyls when the\namine partner is provided in large excess, recruiting the imine\nformed in solution for asymmetric reduction. In some cases the\nreductive amination between ketone and primary and\nsecondary amine partners provided at a 1 : 1 molar ratio is\nachievable using theh type of enzyme, a sub-class of IREDs\ncalled the reductive aminases (RedAms, Scheme 3E). Since the\ndescription of this activity in 2017,\n38 applied on a 50– 100 mg\nscale to laboratory proof-of-principle reactions, the technology\nhas been very rapidly adopted by groups in academia and\nScheme 3 Biocatalytic amination of ketones by various enzymes.

In this\nPerspective we trace the development of IRED technology for\nreductive aminations from therst small-scale transformations\nto industrial processes, highlighting the synergistic contribu-\ntion of structure-guided enzyme evolution, with considerations\nof activity, selectivity, and also process suitability, to the devel-\nopment of large-scale reactions.\nImine reductases (IREDs)\nImine reductases (IREDs)36,37 are NAD(P)H-dependent oxidore-\nductases that catalyze the asymmetric reduction of prochiral\nimines and iminiums forming chiral amines with high enan-\ntioselectivity (Scheme 3D). IREDs wererst described by Naga-\nsawa and co-workers from Gifu University in a patentled in\n2009,\n41 their activity being identied in strains ofStreptomyces\nthat catalyzed the asymmetric reduction of a model cyclic\nimine, 2-methyl pyrroline10,t o( R)o r( S)-2-methylpyrrolidine\n11.\n42 Isolation of these enzymes, followed by reverse genetics\nstudies, led to the sequencing and heterologous expression of\ngenes that encoded IREDs capable of either the (R)-\n43 or (S)-44\nselective reduction of 10 when provided with NADPH. The\nidentication of IRED sequences enabled the discovery of many\nthousands of genes of previously unknown function capable of\nimine reduction, and in the years up to 2017, several academic\nand industrial groups\n45–54 showed that panels of IREDs could be\napplied, either in cell-free form or expressed in whole cells, for\nthe reduction of a broad range of substrates, such as mono-\ncyclic, bicyclic and even large tricyclic imines and iminiums,\nwith excellent complementary stereoselectivity to (R)- or (S)-\nenantiomers.\nThe rst published structures of IREDs\n45,49,53,54 permitted\ninsights into their broad substrate scope, and also informed\nmutational studies that looked to provide therst information\non possible mechanisms of catalysis. The IRED fold, typied by\nthe enzyme Q1EQE0 from Streptomyces kanamyceticus ,\n45 is\nshown in Fig. 1A. IREDs are dimers, constructed of two mono-\nmers each with an N-terminal Rossmann domain connected to\na helical bundle C-terminal domain by a long interdomain\nhelix. A domain sharing arrangement dictates that the active\nsite is formed between the N-terminal domain of one monomer\nand the C-terminal domain of its partner, resulting in a large\ncle that accommodates the nicotinamide cofactor and the\nsubstrate. Structures of IREDs that feature more than one dimer\nin the crystallographic asymmetric unit show that the cle can\nexist in either more open or more closed states, the latter\nproviding a hydrophobic environment for substrate binding.\n45\nOne characteristic of the active sites is a hydrophilic amino\nacid residue, in most cases, an aspartate or tyrosine, which\nprojects from the ceiling of the active site pocket towards the\nnicotinamide ring of the cofactor (Fig. 1B). Enzymes featuring\nAsp\n43 or Tyr44 were shown to be (R)- or (S)-selective for the\nreduction of 2-methylpyrroline respectively. While the role of\nthese residues in IRED catalysis has yet to be determined\nunambiguously, their mutation in (R)-\n45 or (S)-48 selective IREDs\nto alanine led to a marked decrease in activity. A structure of the\nenzyme fromAmycalotopsis orientalis(AoIRED), in complex with\nthe amine product ( R)-1-methyltetrahydroisoquinoline (( R)-\nMTQ) 13 (Fig. 2A) of the reduction of prochiral 1-methyl-3,4-\ndihydroisoquinoline 12,\n54 showed that the product was\noriented in the active site in such a way that the electrophilic\ncarbon of the substrate imine should be well positioned to\nreceive hydride from the C4 atom of the nicotinamide ring of\nthe cofactor from one face, giving the experimentally observed\n(R)-conguration in the product (Fig. 2B).\nThese and other structures suggested that the binding site\nwas particularly suited to the reduction of hydrophobic cyclic\nimines and showed how a prochiral substrate could be posi-\ntioned such that hydride delivery occurred predominantly at\none face of the C]N bond.\nTable 1 Types of enzyme that are used for the reductive amination of carbonyl compounds using ammonia or primary amine partners.

However, the discovery that\nIREDs possessed broad substrate scope, high activity and ster-\neoselectivity, as well as negligible activity toward the reduction\nof ketones, prompted researchers to ask whether, in addition to\ncyclic imines, the activity of IREDs could be expanded to include\nthe formation and reduction of acyclic C]N bonds.\nIn 2014, M¨uller and co-workers rst established that the\nIRED from Streptomyces GF3546, if challenged with 20 mM 4-\nphenyl-2-butanone 14 in a reaction medium containing 250 mM\nmethylammonium buﬀer, representing a 12.5 molar equiva-\nlents (m.e.) of amine, gave a low conversion (8.8%) to the\nsecondary amine product (S)-2-(methylamino)-4-phenylbutane\n14b (Scheme 4).\n49 However, a good enantiomeric excess of\n72% demonstrated the principle that a prochiral imine,\nrecruited from solution, could be bound and reduced asym-\nmetrically by an IRED. Further work by Nestl\n55 consolidated this\ndiscovery by showing that further IREDs, such as the (R)-IRED-\nSr from Streptosporangium roseum, would catalyze the reductive\namination of ketones including acetophenone15, with small\namine partners such as methylamineb, when provided at 50\nm.e., to give the chiral secondary (R)-amine product 15b with\n53% conversion and 78% e.e. (Scheme 4). Interestingly, NMR\nstudies were unable to detect imine formation in solution for\nthis reaction, suggestive of the ability of the IRED to rapidly\ndraw the imine from solution for reduction.\nResearchers at Roche published the rst survey of an\nindustrial library of IREDs applied to reductive amination\nreactions (Scheme 5).\n28 enzymes were screened for their ability to enable the ami-\nnation of model ketones including acetophenone, cyclohexanone\nFig. 1 (A) Structure of dimer of (R)-selective IRED Q1EQE0 fromS. kanamyceticus(PDB 3ZHB)45 with monomers (A) and (B) shown in brown and\nblue respectively; (B) detail of active site clefts in 3ZHB and (S)-selective IRED fromBacillus cereus (4D3F)53 showing cofactor NADP+ and\nresidues D187 and Y188 from the respective enzymes.\nFig. 2 (A) Reduction of 1-methyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline12 to (R)-\nMTQ 13 by AoIRED54 (B) detail of active site ofAoIRED in complex with\nNADP+ (5A9S) and (R)-MTQ (5FWN).

The IR_20-\ncatalyzed reductive amination of 2-hexanone16 with methyl-\namine b was scaled up to 400 mg, oﬀering (R)-amine product16b\nin 55% isolated yield and 96% e.e. Similarly, the reductive ami-\nnation of (R)-3-methylcyclohexanone17 with ammoniad using\nIR_20 gave a 50% yield of (1S,3R)-amine product17d with 94%\nd.e. Matzel and co-workers, working with the Roche collection of\nIREDs, then demonstrated the synthesis of the anti-Parkinson's\nagent (R)-rasagiline18e directly from indanone18 (Scheme 6) and\npropargylaminee, if the latter were supplied in large excess.\n57\nIR-14 was also applied to the 100 mg scale amination of\n10 mM18, with 40 m.e. of aminee, to give the product (R)-18e in\n58% isolated yield and with 90% e.e. The enantiocomple-\nmentary enzyme IR-Sip gave (S)-18e in 81% yield and 72% e.e.\nunder similar conditions. IR-14 also enabled the reductive\namination of cyclohexanone19 with 40 m.e. ofN-methyl prop-\nargylamine f, the rst secondary amine accepted in IRED-\nreductive amination to give product19f, in 59% yield (Scheme\n6). The same group also showed that IREDs could mediate-\ndynamic kinetic resolution reactions during the reductive\namination of racemica-branched aldehydes, which are liable to\nracemise under aqueous reaction conditions, leading to the\nsynthesis of enantioenrichedb-chiral amines.\n58 Hence when IR-\nSip was presented with 20 mM rac-20 or 21 and 10 m.e. of\nmethylamine, 20b or 21b were prepared in 56% yield and 28%\ne.e. or 81% yield and >95% e.e. respectively (Scheme 7). The\nreductive amination of aldehyde 22 with amines g and h in\npursuit of the (S)-congured fungicides febropidine and fen-\npropimorph proved more challenging, giving only 9% and 6%\nconversion respectively. This low turnover was attributed to\nsteric constraints within the active sites of the selected IREDs.\nThese encouraging observations prompted investigation\ninto the role of IREDs in the catalysis of the reductive amination\nreaction. It was clear that reduction must be achieved in the\nenzyme once the prochiral imine was formed, but there was\nlittle evidence about the role of the enzyme in imine formation\nas conversions and reaction rates at low amine:ketone ratio\nwere reported to be low.\nReductive aminases (RedAms)\nBy analogy with abiotic asymmetric reductive amination, IRED-\ncatalyzed reductive amination would be more synthetically\nattractive if amine m.e.s could be reduced, ideally to stoichio-\nmetric equivalency with the carbonyl substrate. In 2017, Aleku\nand co-workers reported the discovery of an (R)-selective IRED\nfrom the lamentous fungus Aspergillus oryzae (AspRedAm),\nwhich displayed the ability to catalyze the reductive amination\nof a broad selection of ketones with amines including cyclo-\nhexanone 19 methylamine b, propargylamine e and cyclo-\npropylamine i (Scheme 8).\n38\nScheme 5 Screening of an IRED library by Roche identiﬁed IR_20 as\na candidate enzyme for enabling reductive aminations of16 and (R)-17\nto form16b and (1S,3R)-17d respectively.56\nScheme 6 IREDs from the Roche library catalyzed the synthesis of\nboth enantiomers of rasagiline18e and tertiary amine19f.57\nScheme 7 IR-Sip catalyzed amination ofa-racemic aldehydes.58\n© 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry Chem. Sci., 2022,13, 4697–4713 | 4701\nPerspective Chemical Science\nIn contrast to previous studies,AspRedAm-catalyzed reduc-\ntive amination could be performed when the enzyme was\nprovided with cyclic or C6 aliphatic ketones and only one m.e. of\na small hydrophobic amine partner, giving near quantitative\nconversion to the corresponding secondary amines.\n38 However,\nless activated ketones, such as indanone18, required higher\nm.e. of amine for high conversion. This study raised for therst\ntime the possibility that the enzyme was, in some cases, cata-\nlyzing not only the reduction of an imine recruited from solu-\ntion, but also the formation of the imine from ketone and\namine. This subclass of IREDs were termed‘Reductive Ami-\nnases’ (RedAms). Notably, AspRedAm catalyzed the reductive\namination of hexanal with allylamine at pH 7.0 and 9.0 at\nsimilar rates, which was in contrast with other IREDs, for which\na 20-fold increase in activity was observed under basic condi-\ntions, in which imine concentration in solution is more\npronounced. This observation further suggested thatAspRedAm\nwas able to catalyze imine formation as part of the reductive\namination process. Kinetic measurements established that the\nenzyme employed a ter – bi mechanism, analogous to that\nemployed byN-methyl\nL-amino acid dehydrogenase,59 in which\ncofactor, then ketone, then amine, are bound sequentially,\nfollowed by release of the secondary amine product andnally\nthe oxidized cofactor. To illustrate the preparative potential of\nthe reactions, AspRedAm was applied to the 100 mg scale\namination of 50 mM19 with methylamineb using 2 m.e. to give\nthe hydrochloride salt in 75% isolated yield.\nStructure and mechanism\nThe structure of AspRedAm (Fig. 3A) was determined in the\npresence of both the cofactor and (R)-rasagiline 18e and again\nrevealed the accommodation of the ligand within the closed\nhydrophobic pocket of the active site, with the electrophilic\ncarbon in close proximity to the C-4 atom of NADP\n+ (Fig. 3B).38\nThe enzyme featured a pendant aspartate D169 in the active\nsite, which, when mutated to alanine or asparagine, resulted in\nmutants with a 200-fold reduction in reductive amination\nactivity. In addition, the amine group of the ligand made close\ncontact with the side chain of tyrosine Y177, possibly indicating\na role for this residue in either substrate anchoring or proton\nScheme 8 Reductive amination reactions catalyzed by the reductive\naminase fromAspergillus oryzae(AspRedAm).38\nFig. 3 (A) Structure of dimer ofAspRedAm (5 G6S) with monomers (A) and (B) in brown and blue respectively; (B) active site ofAspRedAm with\nNADP+ and (R)-rasagiline (R)-18e.38 Residues are from monomer (A) unless marked as (B).

Mutation of Y177 also resulted\nin a 32-fold decrease in catalytic eﬃciency (kcat/Km).\nThe structure ofAspRedAm also permitted therst rational\nmutations to be conducted in pursuit of variants with altered\nactivity. Mutation of (B)W210, at the back of the active site as\npictured in Fig. 3B, to alanine, gave (B)W210A, which displayed\nan inverted stereopreference for the amination of 2-tetralone23\nwith propargyl aminee to form product (S)-23e with 80% e.e.,\ncompared to 95% (R)- for the wild-type enzyme.\nThe discovery ofAspRedAm prompted the study of further\nhomologs of the enzyme in a bid to unearth complementary or\nimproved activity, and also further models for structural and\nmechanistic studies.\n60 A homolog from Aspergillus terreus\n(AtRedAm) proved to be reliable with respect to crystallization,\nand a number of complex structures was achieved.\nIn one, the enzyme was crystallized in the presence of\ncyclohexanone 19, allylamine j and the redox-inactive cofactor\nNADPH4, the use of which appeared to arrest the reductive\namination process in the enzyme (Fig. 4).\nThe nitrogen atom of allylamine was shown to interact with\nthe side chains of both D175 and also N98, and the cyclohexa-\nnone carbonyl to be in the proximity of the phenolic hydroxyl of\nY183. Mutation of D175 to alanine resulted in a mutant D175A,\nfor which activity could not be measured. Mutation of Y183 to\nphenylalanine resulted in a mutant Y183F for which theK\nm for\n19 was increased 6-fold.\nThe structural and mutational data permitted a mechanism\nfor the fungal RedAm-catalyzed amination of ketones with\nsmall hydrophobic amines to be postulated (Scheme 9).\n54\nFollowing binding of the reduced cofactor, the ketone was\nScheme 9 Proposed mechanism for a fungal RedAm-catalyzed reductive amination using residue numbering fromAtRedAm.60 (A) The active\nsite ofAtRedAm binds NADPH, (B) cyclohexanone, and (C) the amine sequentially, to form a quaternary complex; (D) the amine is activated by\nD175 for attack at the electrophilic carbon of the ketone to give a hemiaminal intermediate; (E) the hemiaminal intermediate loses water to give\nthe iminium intermediate; (F) this is reduced by NADPH to give the amine product and NADP+; (G) the amine product and (H) NADP+ are\nsequentially expelled from the active site to regenerate the enzyme for another catalytic cycle.\n© 2022 The Author(s).

Both\nY183 and D175 residues are conserved in fungal RedAms that\nwere the subject of this study, but it is clear that many IREDs\nwith reductive aminase activity possess diﬀerent residues at\nthese key positions, notably Y in the case of D175, and W in the\ncase of Y183, although no mutation or complex structural data\nhas yet been presented to clarify the roles of those residues in\nrelevant enzymes. Indeed the variety of amino acids within\nIREDs that appear to catalyze reductive amination reactions\nsuggests that a number of variations on this model will exist.\nApplications\nThe discovery of the IRED-catalyzed reductive amination insti-\ngated further applications of the reaction and also studies into\nenzyme homologs that may catalyze reactions with comple-\nmentary substrate range and selectivity.\nIt wasrst demonstrated that, in addition to the quantitative\nformation of chiral secondary amines from ketones, fungal\nRedAms, such asAspRedAm, would also catalyze theresolution\nof chiral secondary amines if supplied with the oxidized\ncofactor NADP\n+, at the elevated pH of 10.5.61 Hence the Q240A\nvariant ofAspRedAm catalyzed the resolution of racemicN-allyl-\n4-phenylbutan-2-amine 24 to give 49% conversion to amine (S)-\n24 with >99% e.e., using NADPH oxidase (NOX) to recycle the\ncofactor (Scheme 10).\nIn addition, the W210A mutant ofAspRedAm, which oen\ndisplayed complementary enantioselectivity, catalyzed the\nresolution of the same compound to give the (R)-24 product,\nagain with 54% conversion and >99% e.e.\nThe catalytic promiscuity of the fungal RedAms extended to\nthe amination ofuoroketones. Catalysis by IREDs is, for the\nmost part, distinguished by their inability to reduce ketones to\nalcohols, except in the case of highly activated substrates such\nas 1,1,1-triuoroacetophenone.\n62 Gonz´alez-Mart´ınez and co-\nworkers studied this phenomenon with respect to a number\nof fungal RedAms and mono, bi- and triuorinated ketone\nsubstrates with small amines.\n63 It was determined that, while\nthe expected amines were produced, the proportion of alcohol\nproduct increased with the number ofuorine substituents, but\nthis was also dependent upon the nature of the amine partner.\nHence a,a-diuoroacetophenone 25 was transformed byAdRe-\ndAm to a mixture of alcohol26 and amine25j when allylaminej\nwas the donor, but to a much higher proportion of alcohol26\nand amine25d with ammonia (Scheme 11).\nThis result was attributed to the competition for binding of\nthe ketone and relevant imine intermediate in each case. The\nsuperior ability of some fungal RedAms to enable reductive\naminations using ammonia was further investigated by\nMangas-Sanchez and co-workers.\n64 When challenged with\n10 mM cyclohexanone and only one m.e. of ammonia, RedAms\nfrom the fungi Neosartorya fumigatus (NfRedAm) and Neo-\nsartorya scheri (NsRedAm) gave 90% and 81% conversion\nrespectively. Interestingly, while NfRedAm catalyzed the ami-\nnation of 2-hexanone 24 to give (R)-2-aminohexane 24d with\n72% conversion and 97% e.e. (Scheme 11), a switch in stereo-\nselectivity was observed for 2-decanone27, with (S)-27d being\nobtained with 41% conversion and 84% e.e. with the addition of\n100 m.e. of NH\n4Cl. TheNeosartorya RedAms were also observed\nto be more thermotolerant than other fungal RedAms, with only\na small reduction in activity following incubation at 50\n/C14 C for\n60 min.NfRedAm was applied to the amination of 2-hexanone\n16 at a substrate concentration of 80 mM (8 g L/C0 1), to give\na space-time-yield (STY) of 0.34 g L h/C0 1 of 16d, but this perfor-\nmance was greatly improved by immobilization of the enzyme\non an EziG resin, which resulted in continuous production of\n(R)-2-aminohexane 16d with an STY of 8.1 g L h\n/C0 1.\nReductive amination activity was also described for IREDs\nfrom outside the realm of fungi. Researchers at Pzer published\na study of 45 IRED enzymes from bacteria, in which their\ncapacity for the reductive amination of model ketones with\namine partners was evaluated.\n65 In addition to IREDs displaying\nactivity with known substrates, the study was successful in\nidentifying enzymes with some aﬃnity for bulkier ketone and\namine partners. Hence IR91 catalyzed the amination of 2-tet-\nralone 23 with methylamineb to give (S)-23b in 74% conversion\nand >98% e.e., whereas IR46 gave the (R)-enantiomer. IR44\ncatalyzed the amination of cyclohexanone with benzylamine,\nScheme 10 Resolution of racemic amine24 by AspRedAm.55\nScheme 11 Reductive aminations catalyzed by RedAms fromNeo-\nsartorya spp.63,64\n4704 | Chem.

Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nChemical Science Perspective\naniline and pyrrolidine with 79%, 11% and 99% conversion\nrespectively at 10 mM ketone and 2.5 m.e. of amine. The ami-\nnation with pyrrolidine was performed on a 625 mg scale at\na substrate concentration of 125 mM, giving a 71% isolated\nyield of N-cyclohexylpyrrolidine. Interestingly, little conversion\nwas observed with ammonia as the amine partner.\nIn a similar fashion, researchers at GSK assembled a library\nof 85 IREDs from diverse sources, and again tested their abili-\nties to catalyze reductive aminations of cyclohexanone19,4 -\nuorophenylacetone, and aromatic aldehydes, with bulkier\namines including aniline and benzylamine, but also amino\nthiophenes and aminopyridines, each provided at only 1.1\nm.e.\n66 As part of this screen, IR-01 was reported to catalyze the\namination of cyclohexanone19 with 3-thienylmethylaminek to\nform N-(thiophen-3-ylmethyl)cyclohexanamine 19k, a precursor\nof a melanin-concentrating hormone receptor agonist, with\n97% conversion (Scheme 12).\nThe performance of IR-01 was further evaluated for the\namination of cyclohexanone with substituted anilines, showing\nbroad selectivity with meta- and para-substituted rings, espe-\ncially those with electron donating groups. Interestingly, IR01\nalso exhibited selectivity in the reductive amination of cyclo-\nhexanone using benzene-1,4-diamine, giving a 99 : 1 ratio of\nmonoaminated to diaminated products.\nMontgomery and co-workers at Johnson-Matthey formulated\na library of 95 IREDs that included targets from both fungal and\nplant genomes.\n67 As in the Pzer and GSK studies above,65,66\nenzymes were identied that were competent for the reductive\namination of cyclohexanone 19 with bulkier amines, such as\nbenzylamine, phenethylamine and aniline, provided at only 2\nm.e. Three enzymes, p-IR06, p-IR-17 and p-IR-79 gave >60%\nconversion for the amination with benzylamine. The conversion\nof 50 mM cyclohexanone19 with 100 mM aniline by p-IR89 was\nimproved through the incorporation of co-solvents, notably\ncyclohexane, when added as a 200mL layer to a 700mL reaction,\ngiving a conversion of 81%.\nMarshall and co-workers recently presented an extensive\nsurvey of 384 IRED sequences which, unlike the industrial\nlibraries detailed above, were largely identi ed from meta-\ngenomic samples.\n68 This study was also successful in address-\ning the high-throughput evaluation of IRED reductive aminase\nactivity, which is complicated by the range of possible ketone\nand amine partners. This was accomplished through the\ndevelopment of a colorimetric screen (IREDy-to-go) that could\nbe applied and read in multi-well plates, in which the NADPH\nScheme 12 The formation of melanin-concentrating hormone\nreceptor agonist19k using GSK IR-01.66\nScheme 13 (A) Chemical basis of IRED-y-to-go screen.68 The oxidative activity of an IRED, acting on a secondary amine substrate, generates\nNADPH, which is used by diaphorase to reduce tetrazolium salt28 to red dye29.

The expressed genes were evalu-\nated for their catalysis of a number of reductive amination\nreactions, revealing a diversity of activity with respect to imine\nreduction versus reductive amination, activity and stereo-\nselectivity. In addition to known transformations, the survey\nwas especially revealing in identifying IREDs with superior\nactivity for‘diﬃcult’ substrates such as acetophenone, than had\nbeen observed previously.\nFor example, pIR-361 catalyzed the amination of 3,5-ditri-\nouromethylacetophenone 30 with methylamine b to give\namine 30b, a precursor of the NK1 receptor antagonist orvepi-\ntant, with >99% e.e., albeit with 7% conversion, (Scheme 13B).\npIR-23 catalyzed the amination of hydrocinnamaldehyde 31\nwith dimethylaminel to give the tertiary amine product31l with\n86% conversion (Scheme 13B). Selected IREDs were also iden-\ntied that catalyzed the amination ofb-keto esters with small\namines to giveN-substituted b-amino esters. In this mode, eight\nIREDs were identied and pIR-117 was applied to the synthesis\nof 32e from ethylacetoacetate32 and propargylaminee (Scheme\n13C), with an isolated yield of 54% and >99% e.e.\n68\nThis library of metagenomic IREDs also furnished catalysts\nfor the reductive amination of a-keto esters to form N-\nsubstituted a-amino esters. 69 Screening against the model\nsubstrate 25 mM ethyl-2-oxo-4-phenylbutyrate33 with 2 m.e. of\npropargylamine e, 78 and 20 enzymes from the library were\nfound to be (R)- and (S)-selective respectively. pIR-117 catalyzed\nthe synthesis of (R)-33e with 86% conversion and >99% e.e., but\nwhen the substrate had a methyl substituent, the (S)-product\nwith 97% e.e. was obtained (Scheme 13C). Preparative scale\nreactions were performed for selected enzymes and substrates,\nwith pIR-271 used to accomplish the reductive amination of34\nto give product (R)-34e with 61% isolated yield and >99% e.e.\nThe library of metagenomic IREDs was further evaluated for\nthe reductive amination of bicyclic 2-ketotetralin and 2-keto-\nchroman derivatives by Citoler and co-workers.\n70 Screening of\nthe panel with 5 mM ketone, and either 100 or 200 m.e. of\namine, identied enzymes pIR-88 and pIR-221 that successfully\naminated 5-methoxy-2-tetralone 35 with n-propylamine m to\ngive the secondary amine product35m with conversions of 87%\nand 92% and enantiocomplementary (R)- and (S)- products with\n>99% and 92% e.e. respectively. pIR-221 was applied to the\n1 mmol scale synthesis of35m at 20 mM concentration, giving\na 78% isolated yield of (S)-35m with 92% e.e., which could then\nbe further elaborated byN-alkylation and demethylation over\ntwo steps to give the anti-Parkinson's agent (S)-rotigotine 36\n(Scheme 14).\nIn an elegant extension to the reductive amination reaction,\nNestl and co-workers showed that IREDs could be applied to the\nsynthesis of piperazines from diamine and dicarbonyl\nsubstrates through a double reductive amination.\n71 The ‘R-\nIRED_Ms’ enzyme from Myxococcus stipitatus catalyzed the\nformation of (R)-1-methyl-3-phenyl piperazine 37n with >99%\nconversion and >99% e.e. when the enzyme was incubated with\n5 mM and 1.25 m.e. of the diaminen and dicarbonyl substrate\n37 respectively (Scheme 15).\nIncubation of 5,6-dimethyl-2,3-dihydropyrazine with the\nenzyme gave no products, suggesting that the reactive pathway\nwas likely to proceedvia a condensation– reduction– condensa-\ntion– reduction, rather than by two condensations followed by\ntwo reductions, one of which would constitute an intra-\nmolecular reductive amination. The substrate scope was\nexpanded to 2,3-diamines and 1,4-dicarbonyl substrates with\na variety of alkyl substituents tolerated. The production of (R)-1-\nmethyl-3-phenyl piperazine 37n was scaled up to 50 mM\nsubstrate concentration, giving 8.1 g L\n/C0 1 of the product in 87%\nisolated yield.\nA study of the synthesis of 2-substituted azepanes by IREDs\nrevealed a further possible intramolecular reductive amination\nreaction catalyzed by these enzymes.72 While a straightforward\nasymmetric reduction of seven-membered ring imine38 might\nbe envisaged, this species is not detectable in solution by NMR,\nsuggesting that equilibrium favours the ring-opened amino\nketone 39 (Scheme 16).\nHence, the IRED IR-22 was used to catalyze the intra-\nmolecular reductive amination of the compound to (R)-2-phe-\nnylazepane 40 with 70% conversion and 90% e.e. Additional\nIREDs were employed in the reductive amination of related\nsubstrates, withCfIRED fromCystobacter ferrugenius, giving the\n(S)-series of products and the metagenomic IRED mIRED10\ngiving the ( R)-enantiomers. This phenomenon of intra-\nmolecular reductive aminations was further investigated by Zhu\nand co-workers, who screened a library of 48 IREDs for the\nenantioselective formation of 1,4-diazepanes,\n73 through cycli-\nsation of substrates such as 4-((2-aminoethyl)(5-chlorobenzo[d]\noxazol-2-yl)amino)butan-2-one 41 (Scheme 16), a precursor to\nthe insomnia treatment Suvorexant. Activity for the formation\nof both enantiomers of the product was detected in multiple\n‘IRED-fold’ IREDs, but the best enzyme, then selected for\nimprovement by structure-guided mutagenesis, was actually\na pteridine reductase‘IR1’ from Leishmania major, an enzyme\ninvolved in folate metabolism, which synthesized the sought\naer (R)-enantiomer of the product in 99% e.e.

IR25 was applied to the 100 mL\nscale transformation of 100 mM41 to give the product (S)-42 in\n86% yield and with >99% e.e.\nApplications in cascades\nThe ready accessibility of IREDs, coupled with progress in the\nproduction and application of other enzymes, meant that the\nenzyme-catalyzed reductive amination reactions were ideally\nsuited to cascade reactions for the elaboration of simple and\ncheap precursors, notably hydrocarbons and alcohols, to\nsecondary amines. The feasibility of applying IREDs in multi-\nenzyme cascades had been established in a carboxylic acid\nreductase (CAR)- u-TA-IRED cascade for the conversion of\ncarboxylic acids to cyclic amines.\n74 The reductive amination\ncapability of IREDs could also be applied to the synthesis of\nsecondary amines if ketone substrates could be generatedin\nsitu.\nIn arst application, it was realized that NADPH-dependent\nRedAms might be combined with NADP\n+-dependent alcohol\ndehydrogenases (ADHs) to convert racemic alcohols to chiral\namines in one pot with closed loop cofactor recycling –\na hydrogen-borrowing cascade.\n75 In this mode ADH-150 was\ncombined with AspRedAm in the one-pot oxidation-amination\nof 5 mM cyclohexanol to N-propargyl-cyclohexylamine with\n91% conversion using 1 mM NADP+ and 50 m.e. of propargyl-\namine. A combination of a further ADH, the W110A mutant\nADH from Thermoanaerobacter ethanolicus (TeSADH) and\nAspRedAm, was successful in converting racemic 1-(4-\nuorophenyl)-2-propanol to the (R)-amine product with 41%\nconversion and 95% e.e. ADH-150 andAspRedAm were nally\ncombined in a 100 mg scale conversion of cyclohexanol toN-\nallylcyclohexylamine in 61% yield.\nIn an extension to this study, Tavanti and co-workers showed\nthat cyclohexane 43 could be successively hydroxylated, to\ncyclohexanol 44, oxidized to cyclohexanone19 and then ami-\nnated using a cascade of the R47L/Y51F/R966D/W1046S mutant\nof cytochrome P450BM3, the W110A mutant ADH from\nThermoanaerobacter ethanolicus(TeSADH) andAspRedAm.\n76 The\nchoice of enzymes permitted the closed-loop recycling of\nreducing equivalents from NADPH for the RedAm asTeSADH\nused NADP+ as cofactor (Scheme 17).\nA mixture of enzyme lysates transformed cyclohexane,\nprovided neat to form a two-phase system, to 4.5 mMN-meth-\nylcyclohexylamine, but conversions were negatively aﬀected by\ninhibition of the P450 by the amine donor, and also the\ncompetition of endogenous E. coli enzymes for reducing\nequivalents. Hence, a two-step, one pot approach was adopted,\nin which hydroxylation was completed prior to the addition of\nADH, RedAm and amine, resulting in 19.6 mM of N-prop-\nargylcyclohexylamine 19e. A 20 mL scale two-step reaction was\nperformed that yielded 50 mg of the product.\nThe necessity for separation of biocatalytic steps in the last\nexample is illustrative of the lack of compatibility between some\nsystems that militates against the construction of one-pot\ncascades. Mattey and co-workers have investigated continuous\now systems in an eﬀort to separate otherwise incompatible\nsystems, and applied these to reductive amination cascade\nreactions.\n77 A multipoint injection reactor (MPIR) was employed\nin which an immobilised choline oxidase mutantrst generated\naromatic aldehydes from alcohol substrates. The product was\nthen fed into a reactor containing the immobilised RedAm from\nAjellomyces dermatitidis (AdRedAm) and a glucose dehydroge-\nnase for NADPH recycling. This gave a ow system that\nproduced an STY of 2.1 g L\n/C0 1 h/C0 1 for 4 h. In a further elabora-\ntion, the amine donor for the RedAm reaction could be gener-\nated by au-TA, with both immobilizedu-TA and RedAm kept in\nseparate packed bed reactors to stop cross reactivity with\namines. In this mode, aldehydes such as butyraldehyde and\nbenzaldehyde could be generated using theu-TA and then fed\nto the RedAm reactor with cyclohexanone, giving STYs of the\nScheme 16 Intramolecular reductive aminations for the formation of\nazepanes.72,73\nScheme 17 Enzyme cascade for the amination of cyclohexane.76 FDH\n¼ formate dehydrogenase.\n© 2022 The Author(s).

The ow\ncascade was applied to the synthesis of the pharmaceutical\nprecursor 4-O-methyl norbelladine 47 (Scheme 18) from iso-\nvanillyl alcohol45, which wasrst oxidized to isovanillin using\nan immobilised galactose oxidase variant (GOase M3– 5) in the\nrst reactor. The intermediate aldehyde was then fed to the\nsecond reactor containing the RedAm IR80, along with amine\ndonor tyramine46, to synthesize the product47 with an STY of\n2.26 g L\n/C0 1 h/C0 1 over a 4 h period.\nA further cascade process combined the successive C]C\nbond reduction catalyzed by ene-reductases (EREDs) with the\nIRED mediated reduction of C]N bonds, to convert cyclic ene–\nimines to amines with two chiral centres.78 However, it did not\nprove possible to perform both reactions in one pot, as the IRED\nreaction was much faster than that of the ERED, and the allylic\namines formed were not substrates for the latter enzyme.\nHowever, a subsequent screen of the ene – imine substrates\nagainst IREDs alone unearthed a surprising promiscuous\nactivity of some enzymes for the reduction of both C]C and\nC]N bonds.\n79 A screen of 389 IREDs revealed that 44 of the\nenzymes were competent for the four-electron reduction of the\nmodel ene– imine compound 48 (Scheme 19) to the saturated\namine 49 with a particular enzyme, termed EneIRED, catalyzing\nthe reaction with 83% conversion and a diastereomeric ratio of\n79 : 21. An extension to this observation was that EneIRED also\ncatalyzed the C]C bond reduction in cyclohex-2-enone50 fol-\nlowed by reductive amination using allylamine j, giving N-\nallylcyclohexylamine 19j with 69% isolated yield, constituting\na conjugate reduction-reductive amination reaction (CR-RA).\n79\nNo CR products were formed in the absence of the amine\nsubstrate, strongly indicating a mechanism whereby the\nsubstrate for CR is the condensation product51 of unsaturated\nketone and amine (Scheme 19). Following reduction of51 using\nNADPH, release of the intermediate 52 into solution would\nresult in hydrolysis to the saturated ketone, which would then\nbe bound by the IRED, along with the amine, in the active site\nwith NADPH to achieve a reductive amination to give secondary\namine product19j. The CR-RA catalysis by EneIRED extended to\na range of acyclic and cyclic enones and also enals, in which\ndouble bonds were reduced and intermediates reductively\naminated with small amines to give products in up to 77%\nisolated yield. The dual activity of IREDs in this mode suggests\nthat further complex multi-electron reductions catalyzed by\nthese enzymes might be achieved in the future.\nScalable reactions and industrial\nexamples\nA Design of Experiments (DoE) approach was taken to the\noptimization of a model IRED catalyzed reductive amination\nreaction at scale.\n80 Dominguez and co-workers employed\na customized factorial design, followed by principal component\nanalysis, to the study of the reductive amination of cyclohexa-\nnone 19 with cyclopropylamine i. Initial measurements indi-\ncated that the concentration of ketone and amine, and the\nstability of the IRED enzymes used for the study, were the most\nsignicant parameters in reaction optimization. Initial reac-\ntions using 200 mM19 and 2 m.e. of the amine in batch reac-\ntions gave 87% conversion to the product using IRED-69,\nalthough attempts to increase substrate concentration were not\nsuccessful with this system. Conversions and yields at higher\nsubstrate concentration could be achieved using a fed-batch\nsystem in which concentrations of up to 750 mM ketone,\nsupplied at 100 mM h\n/C0 1, were converted quantitatively to the\namine product 19i using IRED-33, with a turnover number of\n48 279 and an STY of 12.9 g L/C0 1 h/C0 1.\nThe rst published use of extensive protein engineering for\nthe optimisation of an IRED-catalyzed reductive amination was\npublished by researchers at GSK.39 In this study, the target was\nthe coupling of the aldehyde53 with bulky amine tranylcypro-\nmine sulfate o, with the desired product being the (1R,2S)-\nproduct 53o (Scheme 20), an intermediate for the synthesis of\nthe lysine-specic demethylase-1 (LSD) inhibitor GSK2879552.\nAn initial screen of GSK IREDs for the reaction using 2.2 m.e.\nof the racemic amine identi ed ‘IR-46’ from Saccharothrix\nespanaensis as the superior enzyme, which gave the product\nwith 42% isolated yield and 99.9% e.e. in a 5 g scale reaction.\nThe enzyme was targeted for evolution for process suitability,\nespecially for lower pH, to assist reactant and product solubility,\nbut also for improvements in substrate and biocatalyst loading.\n256 out of 296 possible residues were subjected to site\nScheme 18 Flow system for the oxidation-reductive amination\ncascade towards the synthesis of 4-O-methyl norbelladine47.77\nScheme 19 Conjugate Reduction (CR) – Reductive Amination (RA)\ncatalyzed by EneIRED.79\n4708 | Chem.

Mutant Y142S (‘M1’) was\nidentied as the superior mutant under these conditions, with\nconversion improved 40-fold compared to the wild-type enzyme.\nA model of IR-46 suggested that the amino acid side-chain at\nposition 142 makes an H-bond with the pendant aspartate D194\nin the active site. Combined with information on other sites at\nwhich benecial mutations were identied, a combinatorial\nlibrary of 4000 variants based on therst round was further\nassessed, and yielded the multiple-site mutant ‘M2’ (Y142S,\nL37Q, A187V, L201F, V215I, Q231F, S258N) with mutation sites\nat diﬀerent locations within the IRED (Fig. 5A). Modelling again\nsuggested that, although some mutations were within or near\nthe active site, and may have roles in substrate positioning\n(L198M, L201F) or cofactor interactions (G44R, V92K), some\nwere more likely to have roles in improving hydrophobic\ninteractions that stabilised the active IRED dimer.\nA further round of mutation yielded mutant‘M3’ (Y142S;\nL37Q, A187V, L201F, V215I, Q231F, S258N; G44R, V92K, F97V,\nL198M, T260C, A303D), which displayed a 38 000-fold\nimprovement in turnover number compared to the wild-type\n(wt), and was applied in process conditions to the 20 L scale\nmanufacture of the amine product to give 1.4 kg of53o from\nthree runs with 84.4% yield and 99.7% e.e. Interestingly, a study\nof both melting temperature and half-life of the enzyme showed\nthe improved process performance of mutant‘M3’ was largely\ndue to increases in these parameters, which were improved by\n30\n/C14 C and 500-fold respectively over the wild-type, while specic\nactivity was increased only 13-fold.\nResearchers at Novartis have combined genome mining with\nrecent advances in machine learning for the evolution of an IRED\nfor the stereoselective reductive amination of ketone54 with\nmethylamine b to molecule ZPL389 54b (Scheme 21), an H4\nreceptor antagonist used in the treatment of atopic dermatitis.\n81\nLibrary screening plus genome mining was used to identify the\nenzyme ‘IRED88’ as being able to catalyze the amination of54 to\nthe product54b with 70% conversion, and to the required (R)-\nenantiomer, but with only 30% e.e. A deep mutation scanning\n(DMS) approach was takenrst, in which a library of mutants\ncomposed of all amino acid positions mutated to the 19 alter-\nnative residues was screened for activity by mass spectrometry.\nThis revealed a mutant S220T, at the mouth of the active site\nScheme 20 Synthesis of lysine-speciﬁc demethylase-1 (LSD) inhibitor\nGSK2879552 intermediate53o by reductive amination with IR46.39\nFig. 5 (A) Model of structure of‘IR-46’ derived usingAoIRED (5FWN).39 The model shows the location of amino acid residue sites that were\nmutated in variant‘M3,’applied in the kg-scale synthesis of 53n in Scheme 20; (B) structure of IRED88 (ref. 81) (PDB 7OG3) showing locations of\nresidues mutated in variant Q194L/S220T/H230Y, used in the gram-scale synthesis of 54b in Scheme 21; (C) model of structure ofSpRedAm40\nshowing locations of residues mutated in variant‘R3-V6’ used in the ton-scale synthesis of58b (Scheme 22).\n© 2022 The Author(s).

Three rounds of error prone PCR\n(epPCR) using S220T as the platform gave mutant Q194L/S220T/\nH230Y with 85% conversion and 99% e.e. The locations of these\nmutations are shown in Fig. 5B. Applying these data to machine\nlearning algorithms suggested mutants which, when expressed,\ngave lower e.e.s. However, when machine learning was coupled\nwith structure-guided evolution, superior mutants were identi-\ned, including M129L/A156S/Y177W, which gave 59% conver-\nsion and 93% e.e. The epPCR generated variant Q194L/S220T/\nH230Y was selected for a 1 g scale reaction in which a 72%\nyield of the product was obtained at a substrate concentration of\n100 mM, and with >99% e.e. Further analysis of this variant\ndetermined that it had a markedly increased melting tempera-\nture of 57\n/C14 C versus 42 /C14 C for the wild-type, and two-fold the\nspecic activity. This study led to several interesting conclusions\nabout IRED engineering: machine learning was useful as\na ‘sample eﬃcient’ strategy to suggest variants with improved\nproperties, which can each serve as a basis for more focused\nmutation strategies. In any case, it was important that hits were\nvalidated using larger scale reactions. The study also showed that\na combination of improvements in both specica c t i v i t ya n d\nstability were desirable, and also that linear additivity was\nobserved for mutant loci outside the active sites, but that this\nphenomenon was more diﬃcult to predict for active site muta-\ntions, where cooperativity between amino acids involved in the\nmechanism of stereoselectivity was likely.\nResearchers at Pzer also instigated a programme of work\ndirected at the application of IREDs to industrial reductive\namination reactions. Following their description of a family of\nenzymes with a range of activity,\n65 they then reported the appli-\ncation of enzyme IR_064 fromMyxococcus fulvusto the produc-\ntion of sertraline using an imine reduction.82 In this work, the\nenzyme catalyzed the enzymatic reduction of the precursor ((E)-4-\n(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-N-methyl-3,4-dihydronaphthalen-1(2H)-\nimine) 55 to make (S,S)-sertraline 56 (Scheme 22).\nThis was followed up by a study of a reductive amination\nreactions focusing on the synthesis of a key intermediate for an\ninhibitor of the oncology target CDK/2/4/6.\n83 88 IRED enzymes\nwere screened for the ability to catalyze the kinetic resolution\nand reductive amination of 200 mM racemic hydroxyketone57\nwith 120 mM benzylamine hydrochloridep to give secondary\namine product57p (Scheme 22). The enzyme IR007, identied\nas the best candidate, was subjected to directed evolution, to\ngive a nal variant IR007-143 of superior activity, giving 43%\nconversion from a substrate concentration of 50 g L\n/C0 1. A 35%\nisolated yield from the racemate with 98.4% e.e. was achieved. A\ncofactor recycling system using glucose dehydrogenase was\napplied, with sodium hydroxide to maintain the pH of 7.0, as\nthe system results in the formation of gluconic acid. Develop-\nments in RedAm engineering were consolidated at Pzer with\nthe recent development of a RedAm-catalyzed process for the\nproduction of a precursor of the Janus Kinase 1 (JAK1) inhibitor\nabrocitinib 59 (Scheme 22).\n40 80 IREDs were initially screened\nfor their ability to catalyze the amination of isopropyl (1S,3S)-3-\n(methylamino)cyclobutane-1-carboxylate 58 with methylamine\nb to form thecis-isomer of the desired product58b (Scheme 22).\nAn IRED fromStreptomyces purpureus(SpRedAm) was identied\nas the best candidate and applied to the 7.5 g scale reactions at\na substrate loading of 20 g L\n/C0 1, giving the product with 27%\nisolated yield and a d.r. of >99 : 1. SpIRED was therefore\nselected for protein engineering, starting with site saturation\nmutagenesis at 93 sites of 296 possible residues, based on\nhomology models and bioinformatics analysis. The most\nimproved variants, for which mutational sites were at or near\nthe active site, gave >75% conversion at 50 g L\n/C0 1 substrate. A\nsecond round of evolution combined some of the benecial\nmutants to give double and triple variants, of which N131H/\nA170C and A170C/F180M were selected for further rounds,\nwith position 170 further from the active site. A multi-site\nrandom recombination approach was applied to the best\nmutants to give variants with 4 to 6 mutations of improved\nactivity at substrate loadings of 75 g L\n/C0 1. Further recombination\nin a 3rd round gave variant ‘R3-V6’ (N131H, A170C, F180M,\nG217D) (Fig. 5C) of which only position 180 was within the\nactive site, with the others located in the 2nd shell. Thenal\nvariant, which exhibited an improvement in activity of 206-fold\nwas applied to the synthesis of the product on an increasingly\nlarge scale, from batch (1 – 10 kg) to pilot (50 – 100 kg) to\nmanufacturing (>200 kg), with 77% conversion reported,\nagainst 0.75% for the wt under process conditions. Using this\nprocedure 3.5 MT of the product was synthesized.\nConclusions\nThe development of IRED-catalyzed asymmetric reductive\naminations from laboratory discovery to industrial scale\nScheme 21 Synthesis of ZPL38954b using enzyme IRED88 Q194L/\nS220T/H230Y evolved by Novartis.81\nScheme 22 Reductive amination reactions investigated by\nPﬁzer.40,82,83\n4710 | Chem.

In this particular case, the process has been\naccelerated by the availability of a wide range of contemporary\ntechniques in various disciplines that are now available as\nestablished tools for enzyme improvement. Hence, following\nenzyme discovery and initial biochemical and structural char-\nacterisation, informed choices of homologs as starting points\nfor enzyme programs can be made either through screening\ndatabase homolog sequences or metagenomic resources, using\nrapid cloning technology and the design of appropriate HT\nscreens. Following this, medium or high-throughput mutation\nof targets for process improvement can advance initial hits\nquickly, and data that result from these experiments can now be\nfed into machine-learning algorithms for the identication of\nthe most useful improvements, and in some cases, in the\nprediction of further benecial mutations. These studies have\nalready illustrated that, in the case of IREDs and RedAms,\nconsiderations of the process suitability of biocatalysts,\nincluding thermostability, tolerance of co-solvents and half-life,\ncan be as important as mutations that directly aﬀect substrate\nrecognition or turnover. In the case of reductive aminations,\nalthough many advances have been made, many challenges\nremain. The basis for improvements in activity has been diﬃ-\ncult to characterize, as structural data on candidate enzymes in\ncomplex with their target molecules is diﬃcult to acquire. This\ndiﬃculty is compounded by a lack of understanding of the\nnature of the enzymatic process that is being catalyzed. A\ncontinuum appears to exist between true reductive aminations,\ncatalyzed by RedAms, and typied by the reaction of small\nactivated ketones such as cyclohexanone and small hydro-\nphobic amines, and imine reductions, where pre-formed imines\nare rapidly recruited from solution for asymmetric reduction.\nMore specic information will be required on each target\nreductive amination therefore, in order for improvements in\nketone, amine, and imine recognition to be better targeted,\nproviding more robust platforms for enzyme redesign.\nAuthor contributions\nAll authors contributed to the writing of the manuscript.\nConﬂicts of interest\nThere are no conicts to declare.\nAcknowledgements\nWe are grateful to Pzer for the award of studentship funding to\nA.

Nestl*\n[a]\nImine reductases (IREDs) offer biocatalytic routes to chiral\namines and have a natural preference for the NADPH cofactor.\nIn previous work, we reported enzyme engineering of the (R)-\nselective IRED from Myxococcus stipitatus (NADH-IRED-Ms)\nyielding a NADH-dependent variant with high catalytic effi-\nciency. However, no IRED with NADH specificity and (S)-\nselectivity in asymmetric reductions has yet been reported.\nHerein, we applied semi-rational enzyme engineering to switch\nthe selectivity of NADH-IRED-Ms. The quintuple variant A241V/\nH242Y/N243D/V244Y/A245L showed reverse stereopreference\nin the reduction of the cyclic imine 2-methylpyrroline compared\nto the wild-type and afforded the (S)-amine product with\n> 99 % conversion and 91 % enantiomeric excess. We also\nreport the crystal-structures of the NADPH-dependent (R)-IRED-\nMs wild-type enzyme and the NADH-dependent NADH-IRED-Ms\nvariant and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to rationalize\nthe inverted stereoselectivity of the quintuple variant.\nOne of the most sophisticated catalytic properties of enzymes is\ntheir excellent stereoselectivity when forming chiral products\nfrom prochiral substrates. Structural analysis combined with\nenzyme engineering aids in understanding the molecular basis\nof stereoselectivity and provides tools to manipulate this\nproperty for asymmetric transformations in organic chemistry.\nIn our ongoing efforts to develop enzymes for chiral amine\nsynthesis, we have investigated the asymmetric reduction of\nprochiral imines and reductive amination with imine reductases\n(IREDs). The studies with the (R)-selective IRED from Myxococcus\nstipitatus ((R)-IRED-Ms) demonstrated the efficient formation of\nvarious chiral nitrogen-containing heterocycles.\n[1]\nThe extraordi-\nnarily broad substrate spectrum of (R)-IRED-Ms and its high\nactivity in double reductive aminations for piperazines is so far\nunique. However, only (R)-products are accessible with this\nenzyme and for some pharmaceutical building blocks, the\nenantiocomplementary product is desired.\nAlthough several (S)-selective IREDs have already been\ndescribed,\n[2–12]\nno IRED with stereocomplementary selectivity\nand comparable substrate scope to (R)-IRED-Ms was identified.\nMoreover, all characterized members of the IRED family natively\nexhibit NADPH specificity. Cofactor regeneration systems in\nengineered whole-cell systems would benefit from NADH-\ndependent IREDs.\n[13,14]\nRecently, two successful strategies were\nused to separately demonstrate the mutability of two (R)-\nselective IREDs from Streptomyces sp. GF3587 and Myxococcus\nstipitatus ((R)-IRED-Ms), which switch their cofactor preference\nfrom NADPH to NADH.\n[14–16]\nTo date, the enzyme family of IREDs includes more than\n1100 members.\n[6]\nThis family can be divided into two subfami-\nlies, distinguished by their stereoselectivities; tentatively re-\nferred to as (R)- and (S)-IREDs.\n[17]\nA standard numbering scheme\nfor IREDs was introduced to predict (R)- or (S)-stereoselectivity\nby a pendant residue in the active site, D or Y, respectively, at\nstandard position 178.\n[6,17]\nHowever, this approximate classifica-\ntion cannot be applied to all IREDs, as different stereoselectiv-\nities have been described depending on the substrate.\n[12,18]\nThis\nis illustrated by recently characterized IREDs that were found to\nbe (S)-selective despite having aspartic acid as a pendant\nresidue in the active site.\n[19,20]\nIn addition, single-point variants\nof the IRED from Amycolatopsis orientalis displayed inverted\nstereoselectivity compared to the wild-type.\n[21]\nDespite exten-\nsive studies of IREDs,\n[12,16,18,22–26]\nthe molecular mechanism of\nasymmetric imine reduction and, if relevant, imine protonation,\nremains unclear.\n[27]\nOne mechanism has been proposed for the\nIRED subfamily of fungal reductive aminases (RedAms). Residues\nD169 and Y177 (standard positions 187 and 195) have been\nsuggested to be involved in both protonation and deprotona-\ntion of reaction intermediates.\n[21,28,29]\nFurthermore, conforma-\ntional changes in cofactor binding indicate a significantly\nreduced volume of the substrate-binding site in closed enzyme-\ncofactor complexes.\n[10,30,31]\nUnfortunately, the lack of ternary\nenzyme-cofactor-substrate complexes with imine substrates\nhinders a detailed mechanistic understanding.\n[27]\nThese issues\nare associated with highly flexible regions and domain move-\nments that lead to conformational changes,\n[32]\nas reflected in\n[a] P.

The NADH-specific variant\nNADH-IRED-Ms encompassed the mutations N32E/R33Y/T34E/\nK37R/L67I/T71V. The solved structures exhibit the canonical\nIRED fold\n[24]\nwith an N-terminal Rossmann domain connected to\na C-terminal helical bundle via a long interdomain helix.\nTwo monomers form a dimer, with the N-terminal domain\nof one monomer and the C-terminal domain of the other\nforming an active-site pocket that contain the cofactor (Fig-\nure 1A). Comparison of the (R)-IRED-Ms monomer with other\nIREDs in the PDB using the DALI server\n[34,35]\nrevealed closest-\nstructural homology to (R)-IRED-Sr from Streptosporangium\nroseum (PDB code: 5OCM;\n[31]\n36 % sequence identity; rmsd 2.1 Å\nover 286 Cα atoms). Analysis of the cofactor binding loop\nrecognizing the 2’-phosphate of NADP\n+\nrevealed prominent\ninteractions between this group and the side chains of N32,\nR33, T34 and K37 (Figure 1B). Superposition of the structure of\nNADH-IRED-Ms in complex with NAD\n+\n(Figure 1C) revealed\nchanges in enzyme-cofactor interactions. Accordingly, the\ncarboxylate introduced at position 32 interacts with the free\nribose hydroxyls of the NAD\n+\nribose. The residue Y33, which\nreplaces arginine, is no longer in close contact with the ribose.\nHowever, it fulfils a stacking interaction function with the\nadenine ring system, as with R33 in the wild-type. The lack of\ninteraction of the new side chains of E34 and R37 with ribose\nhydroxyls is reflected in their mobility, resulting in poorer\nelectron density for these side chains in the NADH-IRED-Ms\nNAD\n+\nstructure.\nTo identify targets for mutagenesis, the active sites of\nstereocomplementary IREDs were compared to identify amino\nacid that mediate stereoselectivity. The best-known residue in\n(R)-IRED_Ms is D171 (standard numbering position 178), which\nis also described as a catalytically active amino acid. Most (R)-\nselective IREDs have an aspartic acid at this position, in contrast\nto tyrosine in most (S)-selective IREDs. The function of the\nconserved aspartic acid or tyrosine is still unclear although\nexchanging this residue for alanine or phenylalanine resulted in\nenzymes with greatly reduced activity.\n[6,11,23]\nTo switch the stereoselectivity of (R)-IRED_Ms, D171 was first\nchosen as the target site for saturation mutagenesis. The\nresulting D171X variants (including D171Y) showed little or no\ncatalytic activity, indicating the key role of this residue in the\ncatalytic cycle. Similarly, the site-saturation mutagenesis at\nother positions reported to be essential for (S)-selectivity of\nIREDs did not result in altered stereoselectivity of NADH-IRED-\nMs (Table S1).\nWe next applied site-directed mutagenesis of (R)-IRED_Ms\nto randomize the residues at positions 123, 171 and 178, which\nhave been described in literature to play a role in determining\nthe stereoselectivity of IREDs.\n[6,12,17]\nWe performed a multiple\nsequence alignment of 31 different stereocomplementary IREDs\n(12 (S)- and 19 (R)-selective IREDs, Figure S1 in the Supporting\nInformation).\nFigure 1.

Furthermore,\nsaturation mutagenesis of V212, the equivalent position of\nW210 of the IRED from Amycolatopsis orientalis, the mutation of\nwhich has been shown to invert stereoselectivity,\n[33]\nwas also\nunsuccessful in altering this property in (R)-IRED-Ms. We there-\nfore concluded that further enzyme engineering of different\nresidues may be required to alter the enzymatic discrimination\nof the re- and si-faces of the prochiral imine.\nStructural information obtained from the crystal structures\nof NADH-IRED-Ms in complex with NADH was used to identify\namino acids near the cofactor (Table S2). Subsequent screening\nof (limited) site-saturation mutagenesis libraries that included\nposition 13, 95, 120–124, 171, 175, 178, 212, 237, 241, 242, and\n245 identified the mutation A245 C, which slightly decreased\nthe stereoselectivity. Therefore, a second mutant library was\nconstructed by randomizing residues in the region 240–246\n(standard positions 256–259) and combining them into pairs\n(Table S3) to account for synergistic effects. Screening revealed\na double variant A241V/H242Y that formed slightly less (R)-\nenantiomeric product. Finally, further exchanges (see Table S3)\nin the active site revealed that mutations in a specific region\n(A241–A245) contributed to changes in stereoselectivity (Fig-\nure 2). While a point mutation A245 L showed significant\ndeterioration in stereoselectivity, the combination of five\nmutations in this region A241V/H242Y/N243D/V244Y/A245L\n(variant designated (S)-NADH_V11) switched stereoselectivity\nfrom > 99 % ee (R) to 91 % ee (S) in the reduction of 2-\nmethylpyrroline (1). Besides imine 1, three additional imines\nmethyl- (2) and phenyl piperideine (3) as well as 1-methyl-3,4-\ndihydroisoquinoline (4) were transformed to the corresponding\namine products (1 a-4 a) using the (S)-NADH_V11 variant\n(Table 1). It is worth noting that the final variant comprising 11\nmutations had reduced stability and expression levels were also\npoorer.\nTo gain insight into the molecular basis of the inverted\nstereoselectivity observed for NADH-IRED-Ms and (S)-NADH_\nFigure 2.

This\nfinding underscores the functional relevance of the previously\nproposed imine-polarizing flanking residues, the conventional\nproton donor, and the putative alternative proton donor (IRED\nstandard positions 112, 187, and 195, respectively).\n[27]\nFor all\nthree residues, the respective stereoselectivity was assessed by\nclassifying the orientation of the bound 2-methylpyrroline\nmolecule with respect to the nearest hydride of NADH (Table 2).\nThe stereopreference of NADH-IRED-Ms_2 and (S)-NADH_V11_2\nevaluated by the simulations was consistent with that observed\nexperimentally. To further investigate the molecular basis of\nstereopreference, the ternary enzyme-cofactor-substrate com-\nplex with the smallest distance between proton donor and\nsubstrate was selected for each enzyme.\nInterestingly, the differences in stereopreference were\ncaused by two distinct binding modes with a mirror-image\norientation of the nicotinamide group relative to the planar\nimine moiety (Figures 3A and B). While in NADH-IRED-Ms, the\nnicotinamide moiety is oriented towards the helical dimeriza-\ntion area, in (S)-NADH_V11 it is oriented towards the Rossmann\nfold. The two different binding modes are caused by a rotation\nof a helix in the substrate-binding site (residues 241–245) by an\nangle of 15 degrees. The introduced mutations trigger this\nstructural difference in the corresponding helical region. This\nTable 2.

The nicotinamide is stabilized differently in the two\nenzymes (Figure S6).\nHydrogen bonding between D171 and S95 was observed in\nboth enzymes, supporting the previously proposed functional\nrole of ‘imine-polarizing’ flanking-residues.\n[27]\nThe higher fre-\nquency of a D171-S95 hydrogen bond in simulation system\nNADH-IRED-Ms_2 compared to (S)-NADH_V11_2 (Figure 3C) is\nconsistent with the higher catalytic activity of NADH-IRED-Ms.\nHowever, it cannot be excluded that destabilizing effects of the\nintroduced mutations cause this effect. In this context, the\nimportance of the local electrostatic fine-tuning, the need for\nproper pK\na\nmatching, and the potential occurrence of proton-\nrelays in IREDs are highlighted.\nAccording to these results, a catalytic dyad seems to be\nuseful for proton donation in D-type\n[12,27]\nIREDs. In general, this\ndyad consists of an aspartic acid (standard position 187) and a\nflanking serine/threonine residue (standard position 111). In\naddition to an active role in proton donation, the passive\nfunctionality of these residues could enable the necessary\nprotonation. In this scenario, the catalysis could occur by\npositioning of the C = N double bond of the imine at a polar site\nin the otherwise predominantly non-polar binding pocket and\nby proton transfer from water molecules that are also\napproximated. A similar mode of operation could apply to Y-\ntype\n[12,27]\nIREDs. A catalytic triad consisting of tyrosine, serine\nand asparagine would also provide electrostatic fine-tuning. In\nparticular, similar patterns in reasonable proximity to the\ncofactor could facilitate protonation.\n[8,30]\nConversely, some residues in the large binding sites of IREDs\ncould contribute to unproductive binding modes that limit\noverall catalytic efficiency. This could be the case for W179\n(standard position 195) in NADH-IRED-Ms and (S)-NADH_V11.\nThe simulations performed indicate that the amine hydrogen of\nthe indole moiety most frequently interacts with the imine\nnitrogen atom. Based on this observation, we speculate that\nthis nonproductive binding mode may limit the catalytic\nefficiency of various IREDs. The previously described 8-fold\nincreased activity of variant W191 A of IR45 from Streptomyces\naurantiacus supports this conjecture.\n[38]\nHowever, we cannot\nrule out the possibility that this observation is substrate\ndependent or that similar mutations have a negative impact on\nthe stereoselectivities in other IREDs. Such effects have been\nreported for the IRED from Amycolatopsis orientalis, as the\nY179F and Y179 A variants resulted in inverted stereoselectivity\nin the reduction of multiple substrates.\n[30]\nThe high sequence\nvariability, large size, and conformational flexibility of the\nsubstrate-binding pockets of IREDs provide many degrees of\nfreedom for electrostatic fine-tuning of the active site. Despite\nthis variability, IREDs exhibit remarkably high stereoselectivity.\nMoreover, the role of flexible regions in catalysis complicates\nthe analysis of the determinants of stereoselectivity using X-ray\nstructural data.\n[32]\nIn contrast, MD simulations are widely used as\na valuable method to analyze biochemical properties of flexible\nproteins on the molecular level.\n[39,40]\nIn addition, simulation-\nbased engineering approaches can provide the necessary time\nand cost efficiency for chiral amine production on an industrial\nscale. An example of this is the production of, for example, 1,4-\ndiazepanes by the pteridine reductase 1 from Leishmania major,\nan imine-reducing member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/\nreductase family.\n[41]\nIn summary, we demonstrate the engineering of NADH-\nIRED-Ms to yield a variant with high (S)-selectivity and NADH\nspecificity in the asymmetric reduction of substrate 2-meth-\nylpyrroline. Targeted mutagenesis of a specific region in the\nIRED substrate-binding pocket and the combination of muta-\ntions was key to achieving the switched selectivity. Five\nadditional mutations in the variant NADH-IRED-Ms were\nsufficient to obtain a (S)-selective variant with 91 % ee.\nDetermining the structure of the NADH-dependent imine\nreductase variant and using it for MD simulations also allowed\nrationalization of the altered stereopreference. Thus, the MD\nsimulations underscore the effectiveness of this method to gain\na deeper understanding of the substrate-binding behavior of\nIREDs, which was previously limited by the lack of substrate\ncomplexes.\nAcknowledgements\nN.

In particular, substituted chiral piperidines are prominent targets due to their prevalence in medicinally\nrelevant compounds and their precursors. A potential biocatalytic approach to the synthesis of this privileged scaffold would be the\nasymmetric dearomatization of readily assembled activated pyridines. However, nature is yet to yield a suitable biocatalyst specifically\nfor this reaction. Here, by combining chemical synthesis and biocatalysis, we present a general chemo-enzymatic approach for the\nasymmetric dearomatization of activated pyridines for the preparation of substituted piperidines with precise stereochemistry. The\nkey step involves a stereoselective one-pot amine oxidase/ene imine reductase cascade to convert N-substituted tetrahydropyridines\nto stereo-defined 3- and 3,4-substituted piperidines. This chemo-enzymatic approach has proved useful for key transformations in\nthe syntheses of antipsychotic drugs Preclamol and OSU-6162, as well as for the preparation of two important intermediates in\nsynthetic routes of the ovarian cancer monotherapeutic Niraparib.\n■\nINTRODUCTION\nThe ubiquity of saturated nitrogen heterocycles (N-hetero-\ncycles) in natural products and pharmaceuticals continues to\ndrive the development of innovative strategies for their efficient\nsynthesis.\n1,2\nIn particular, chiral piperidines are much sought\nafter structures due to their prevalence as scaffolds in a range of\nbioactive molecules including market-approved active pharma-\nceutical ingredients (APIs).\n3\nNature provides highly efficient\nbiocatalysts for the biosynthesis of N-heterocycles,\n4,5\noffering\nhigh enantio- and regio-selectivity under benign conditions.\nThese biocatalysts have previously enabled the development of\none-pot cascade reactions to access stereo-enriched 2-, 2,6-,\nand 2,3-substituted piperidines.\n6−10\nHowever, the translation\nof these methods to the corresponding stereoenriched 3-\nsubstituted and 3,4-substituted scaffolds, the core of many\nimportant therapeutic compounds (Figure 1A), remains\nchallenging due to difficulties in stereoselectivity control\ncombined with limited availability of suitable starting materials.\nAsymmetric chemical synthetic approaches for the prepara-\ntion of 3-substituted and 3,4-disubstituted piperidines include\nthose based on metalation/cross-coupling,\n11−14\nGrignard\nMichael addition,\n15\nring closure,\n16\nand transition-metal-\ncatalyzed dearomatization of pyridines.\n17−21\nHowever, limi-\ntations are associated with all of these approaches, including\nhigh reaction temperatures, sensitivity to moisture, lack of\navailability of starting materials, and the use of expensive\nnoncommercial chiral ligands.\n11,22\nAmong reported methods,\nthe catalytic asymmetric dearomatization of pyridines is\nachieved by quaternization-activation of the pyridine nitrogen,\npermitting access to mild reduction methods to chiral\npiperidines (Figure 1B, left).\n17,23−26\nWhilst nature has yielded\npyridine synthases to prepare pyridines,\n27\nan effective\nbiocatalyst for their dearomatization is yet to be discovered.\nWith this in mind, we sought to combine mild chemical\nReceived: July 8, 2022\nPublished: November 9, 2022\nArticlepubs.acs.org/JACS\n© 2022 The Authors.

{"text": "reduction of pyridiniums to tetrahydropyridines (THPs) with\nthe exquisite stereoselectivity of a biocatalytic cascade to\nreduce the final C�C bond as an efficient strategy for\nasymmetric dearomatization of activated 3- and 3,4-substituted\npyridines (Figure 1C). Biocatalysts with broad substrate scope\nfor the reduction of C�C bonds require the conjugation of\nthe alkene to an electron-withdrawing group. Recently, C�C\nbonds conjugated to C�N bonds have been shown to\nundergo full reduction to amines through the combination of\nene-reductases (EREDs) and imine reductases (IREDs),\n6\nas\nwell as the newly discovered ene imine reductase (EneIR-\nEDs).\n28\nWe reasoned that biocatalytic oxidation, using an\namine oxidase\n(AmOx), of the THP in situ would generate the\ncorresponding dihydropyridiniums (DHPs), generating an\nactivated C�C bond conjugated to the C�N bond, which\ncould then be reduced with these biocatalysts to generate a\ncascade to the desired 3- and 3,4-substituted piperidines. This\ncascade complements a previous amine oxidase AmOx-IRED\nderacemization processes in which only amine oxidation and\nC�N bond reduction take place.\n29,30\n■\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nA series of substituted N-alkyl THPs 1b-21b was prepared in\ngood yields (50−90%) from activated pyridines (1a-21a) using\nNaBH\n4\nas previously reported.\n31\nInitially, we explored the\nconversion of THPs to piperidines using AmOxs in\ncombination with EREDs or EneIREDs (see Supporting\nInformation 2.1.; Figures S1−S5 for the complete list of\nTHPs screened). For the first step, we tested AmOx variants\nthat have been shown to be effective biocatalysts for the\noxidation of N-alkyl THPs.\n32,33\nThe 6-hydroxy-D-nicotine\noxidase (6-HDNO) variant, E350L/E352D,\n34\nwas found to be\neffective, with a broad substrate scope, including oxidation of\n1b, a precursor to Preclamol. We next screened for activity for\nthe second step, namely, reduction of the C�C bond of the\nα,β-unsaturated iminium ion. Whereas the panel of EREDs\ndisplayed no activity, the EneIRED from an unidentified\nPseudomonas sp. (EneIRED-01),\n28\nin combination with 6-\nHDNO, was effective at reducing a number of THPs and could\nbe used to prepare piperidine (R)-1c in good yield and with\nexcellent enantioselectivity (see Supporting Information 2.1.,\nTable S1; entry 1−3, ≥42% yield, 96% ee).\nNext, we set out to identify further EneIREDs that could\nalso generate enantioenriched 3-substituted piperidines. By\nscreening the recently reported metagenomic IRED collec-\ntion,\n35\nin combination with the 6-HDNO variant, we were able\nto quickly identify biocatalysts capable of generating either\nenantiomer of piperidine (R/S)-1c from THP 1b (see\nSupporting Information 2.2., Table S2). From this screen, we\norganized these EneIREDs into two groups: Series A (red:\nEneIREDs 01−04) that gave piperidine (R)-1c (Table S2 up\nto >99% ee) and Series B (blue: EneIREDs 05−09) that\ngenerated the enantiocomplementary piperidine (S)-1c (Table\nS2, up to 96% ee).\nWith effective EneIREDs for the preparation of both\nenantiomeric series, we probed the substrate scope of the 6-\nHDNO-EneIRED cascade (Table 1). Enzymes in Series A and\nB accepted a variety of aryl substituents at the C-3-position of\nthe THP scaffold, affording products 1c-7c in high yields,\nconversion, and enantioselectivity. Five-membered heterocy-\nclic 3-substituents such as furan 8c and thiophene 9c were also\nFigure 1. High-value stereo-enriched 3- and 3,4-substituted piperidines and strategies for their synthesis.

Am. Chem. Soc. 2022, 144, 21088−21095\n21091\n≥94% ee). Additionally, a variety of N-alkyl substituents were\naccepted forming the piperidine products 1c-12c in good to\nexcellent yields. Of these, N-allyl 3c-4c and N-propargyl 12c\npiperidines provide useful synthetic handles that can be easily\nremoved or further functionalized.\nMore hindered 3,4-disubstitituted THPs could also be\nreduced using the cascade, resulting in the formation of the\nsubstrate-dependent cis or trans isomer. These included\nsubstrates in which both substituents were simple alkyl (3,4-\ndimethyl) 17b or part of a fused bi-cyclic ring system\n(octahydroisoquinoline) 18b. We then probed the tolerance\nfor a combination of alkyl and aryl substituents at C-3 and C-4.\n3-Phenyl-4-methyl disubstituted compounds 19b and 20b\nprovided the corresponding piperidines (A)-19c and (A)-20c\nin excellent yields and diastereoselectivity (cis major; >96:4 dr;\n≥87% yield). The system also tolerated the isomeric 3-methyl-\n4-phenyl disubstituted THP 21c. In addition to the inversion\nof stereochemical outcome at the C-3 position (Series A vs\nSeries B), we also discovered some EneIREDs in Series B that\nprovided an inverted diastereomeric configuration of the 3,4-\ndisubstitituted piperidines 17c-20c compared to Series A.\nTo probe the mechanism of the 6-HDNO-EneIRED\ncascade, the conversion of THP 6b to piperidine 6c was\ninvestigated by in situ\n19\nF NMR reaction monitoring (Figure\n2A). After <5 min, formation of piperidine 6c was apparent\nand after 60 min, the THP 6b was completely consumed. In\nthe absence of the EneIRED, 6-HDNO catalyzed the\npreviously reported aromatization of THP 6b to the\ncorresponding pyridinium ion 6a (see Supporting Information\n2.3., Figure S6, >99% conversion after 24 h).\n33\nAs expected, no\ndirect reduction of the THP 6b to piperidine 6c was observed\nin the absence of 6-HDNO, suggesting that a transiently\ngenerated dihydropyridinium (DHP) is the substrate for the\nEneIRED reduction. Using the cascade with THP-10b, we\nwere able to isolate the enamine 10e before full conversion to\nthe piperidine 10c (see Supporting Information 5.1., 63%\nyield), which strongly suggested the participation of this\ncompound in the reaction pathway. Accordingly, enamine 10e\nwas converted to piperidine 10c using EneIRED-01 alone, in\nexcellent yield and high enantioselectivity, equivalent to the full\ncascade with THP-10b (Figure 2B, top; 88% yield, 94% ee).\nDeuterium labeling experiments were also implemented to\nfurther elucidate the mechanism of the EneIRED enamine\nreduction step. Carrying out the reduction of enamine 10e\nusing EneIRED-01, in the presence of GDH and D -glucose-1-\nd\n1\nto generate deuterated NAD(P)D in situ, C-2-mono-\ndeuterated 10c-d\n1\nwas formed (80% deuterium incorporation,\n82% yield). This suggests that the enamine intermediate 10e\nmay undergo protonation to the iminium before NAD(P)H\nhydride delivery (Figure 2B, bottom and see Supporting\nInformation 5.2.).\nA proposed mechanism for the 6-HDNO-EneIRED cascade\nis outlined in Figure 2C. For illustrative purposes, we have\ndepicted the transformation of THP-3b to (S)-3c as this\nproduct is used in the subsequent synthesis of the key\nintermediate for Niraparib described below. Initially, 6-HDNO\noxidation of THP-3b results in the activation of the THP C�\nC bond for EneIRED-catalyzed asymmetric conjugate\nreduction of DHP-3d at the expense of NADPH to generate\nenamine 3e (Cycle 1; step iii). This intermediate 3e is\nexpected to be in equilibrium with chiral iminium 3f via a\nnonselective protonation in solution, which has been\nextensively documented.\n9,36,37\nDepending on the EneIRED\nemployed (Series A or B), the kinetic selective reduction of\none enantiomer of chiral iminium 3f affords the enantioen-\nriched piperidine 3c as the final product via reduction with a\nsecond molecule NADPH (Cycle 2; step vii). In situ\nepimerization of the enantiomer in 3f via enamine 3e enables\na dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) to occur to generate\npiperidine (S)-3c mediated by the EneIRED.\nPredominantly, EneIREDs in Series A yielded (R)-\npiperidines whilst enzymes in Series B such as EneIRED-07\nyielded the (S)-product. In order to gain insight into the mode\nof substrate binding in the active site, we determined the\nstructure of EneIRED-07 from Micromonospora sp. Rc5 to a\nresolution of 2.55 Å in complex with NADP\n+\nusing X-ray\ncrystallography. Crystals were obtained in the P2\n1\n2\n1\n2 space\ngroup and featured six molecules in the asymmetric unit,\nrepresenting three dimers. EneIRED-07 displays the canonical\nfold observed for IREDs,\n38,39\nwith two monomers associating\nto form two active sites between the N-terminal Rossmann\ndomain of one subunit and the C-terminal helical bundle of its\nneighbor (Figure 2D). Analysis using the DALI server\n40\nsuggested that the IRED with the most closely related structure\nwas the IRED from Streptosporangium roseum (PDB 5OCM)\nwith an rmsd of 1.0 Å over 288 Cα atoms. Following building\nand refinement of the protein atoms, clear omit density was\nobserved in each active site corresponding to the cofactor\nNADP\n+\n. The iminium intermediate (S)-3f, the preferred\nenantiomer for EneIRED-07 imine reduction, was modeled\ninto the active site using Autodock Vina (Figure 2E).\n41\nThe\nmodel suggests that the allyl group of (S)-3f is bound within a\nhydrophobic pocket formed by methionine residues M125,\nM183, and M214 at the rear of the active site as shown; the\npara-bromo-phenyl group projects toward the front of the\nactive site bordered by L180, W184, and the NADP\n+\ncofactor.\nThis ligand conformation places the electrophilic carbon\napproximately 3.6 Å from the NADP\n+\npyridinium ring C4\natom, from which hydride is transferred. Modeling of the (R)-\nenantiomer of 3f places the allyl group at the base of the active\nsite with less favorable interactions with hydrophilic residues\nY225 and D238 (see Supporting Information 7.4., Figure S13).\nThe absolute configuration of 6c-10c was verified using\nVCD (Vibrational Circular Dichroism), a technique available\nfor the determination of stereochemical configuration of chiral\nmolecules in the solution phase.\n42−45\nThis was accomplished\nby the comparison of experimental infrared (IR) and VCD\nspectra to density functional theory (DFT)-calculated spectra\nof a specific configuration. Because this series of molecules was\nof low molecular weight with a limited number of low energy\nconformations (fewer than 10 in each case), four different\nDFT methods were completed for each compound. We tested\ntwo functionals (B3LYP and B3PW91) each with two basis\nsets (6-31G(d) and cc-pVTZ) to see which would have the\nbest statistical results in each case.\n46\nAs expected, all five\npiperidine methods yielded consistent results for each\nenantiomer, with the best results coming from cc-pVTZ/\nB3PW91 for piperidines 6c and 9c, cc-pVTZ/B3LYP for\npiperidines 7c and 8c, and 6-31G(d)/B3PW91 for piperidine\n10c. Neighborhood similarity values for IR and VCD, as well\nas confidence level (≥93%) were obtained using BioTools\n(Jupiter, Fl) CompareVOA software (see Supporting In-\nformation 4.3., and 12.).\n47,48\nBecause of the similarity of the\nchiral core, the VCD experimental spectra were very similar for\nall tested compounds. Future work could therefore forego the\ncalculations in order to streamline the process.\nJournal of the American Chemical Society pubs.acs.org/JACS Article\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.2c07143\nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. 2022, 144, 21088−21095\n21092\nFinally, we sought to apply the chemo-enzymatic dearoma-\ntization of activated pyridines to several target bioactive\nmolecules (Figure 3). First, we targeted the antipsychotic drug\nPreclamol. At preparative scale (1 mmol), THP-1b was\nconverted to both (R)-(+)- and (S)-(−)-preclamol 22, using\nEneIRED-01 and EneIRED-05, respectively. Both enantiomers\nwere prepared in four steps from 3-(3-methoxyphenyl)pyridine\nand were obtained in ≥50% overall yield and with 96% ee\n(Figure 3A and see Supporting Information 5.1.). Next, we\ncarried out the three-step syntheses of both enantiomers of\nOSU6162 2c, using EneIRED-02 and EneIRED-06, and these\nwere both accomplished in ≥36% overall yield and ≥92% ee\n(Figure 3B), respectively.\nTo further demonstrate the application of the cascade, we\nsynthesized the two intermediates 23 and 24 en route to\nNiraparib (Figure 3C), the first poly ADP ribose polymerase\n(PARP) inhibitor to be approved as a first-line monother-\napeutic for the maintenance treatment of patients with\nadvanced ovarian cancer.\n49\nFor route I, we showed that\ncommercially available 3-(4-bromophenyl)pyridine could be\nefficiently converted to piperidine (S)-3c in just three steps\nand 61% overall yield (99% ee). This was followed by\ndeallylation and N-Boc-protection to yield (S)-23 in 64% yield,\na key intermediate in Merck’s second-generation synthesis.\n50\nAlternatively, in route II, by starting from commercially\navailable 4-(pyridin-3-yl)aniline, we converted pyridinium salt\n4a to (S)-24 in 29% overall yield and with 93% ee, a key\nintermediate in Merck’s first-generation synthesis.\n51\nThe\ngeneral applicability of the method was also showcased by\nthe preparation of the corresponding (R)-enantiomers of both\n23 and 24 in good yields and high enantioselectivity (see\nSupporting Information 5.1.).\nIn summary, we report the development of a versatile and\nhighly efficient chemo-enzymatic dearomatization of activated\npyridines for the preparation of stereo-enriched 3- and 3,4-\ndisubstituted piperidines. The 6-HDNO-catalyzed oxidation of\nreadily accessible THPs facilitates EneIRED-catalyzed con-\njugate reduction and iminium reduction to yield a broad range\nof chiral piperidines. The short syntheses of both enantiomers\nof Preclamol and OSU6162, as well as chiral precursors to\nNiraparib, highlight the flexibility and utility of the method\npresented, emphasizing the advantages of combining chemical\nsynthesis with biocatalysis for developing new catalytic\nmethods for the preparation of important chiral compounds.\nFurthermore, the increasing ability to systematically screen\nlarge panels of biocatalysts against new targets leads to the\nrapid identification of enzymes with applications in asymmetric\nsynthesis.\n■\nASSOCIATED CONTENT\n*\nsı\nSupporting Information\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at\nhttps://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/jacs.2c07143.\nExperimental procedures including characterization of\ncompounds, spectroscopic data of analytical biotransfor-\nmations, and control experiments (PDF)\n■\nAUTHOR INFORMATION\nCorresponding Author\nNicholas J.

Here, we present a biocatalytic cascade that combines\nene-reductases (EReds) with imine reductases/reductive aminases\n(IReds/RedAms) to enable the conversion of α,β-unsaturated\nketones into primary, secondary, and tertiary amines containing\ntwo stereogenic centers in very high chemical purity (up to >99%),\na diastereomeric ratio, and an enantiomeric ratio (up to\n>99.8:<0.2). Compared with previously reported strategies, our\nstrategy could synthesize two, three, or even all four of the possible\nstereoisomers of the amine products while precluding the\nformation of side-products. Furthermore, ammonium or alkylam-\nmonium formate buffer could be used as the only additional\nreagent since it acted both as an amine donor and as a source of reducing equivalents. This was achieved through the\nimplementation of an NADP-dependent formate dehydrogenase (FDH) for the in situ recycling of the NADPH coenzyme, thus\nleading to increased atom economy for this biocatalytic transformation. Finally, this dual-enzyme ERed/IRed cascade also exhibits a\ncomplementarity with the recently reported EneIRED enzymes for the synthesis of cyclic six-membered ring amines. The ERed/\nIRed method yielded trans-1,2 and cis-1,3 substituted cyclohexylamines in high optical purities, whereas the EneIRED method was\nreported to yield one cis-1,2 and one trans-1,3 enantiomer. As a proof of concept, when 3-methylcyclohex-2-en-1-one was converted\ninto secondary and tertiary chiral amines with different amine donors, we could obtain all the four possible stereoisomer products.\nThis result exemplifies the versatility of this method and its potential for future wider utilization in asymmetric synthesis by\nexpanding the toolbox of currently available dehydrogenases via enzyme engineering and discovery.\nKEYWORDS: biocatalysis, reductive amination, α-chiral amines, biocatalytic cascades, imine reductases, reductive aminases, ene-reductases\n■\nINTRODUCTION\nThe development of efficient and highly selective catalytic\nmethods for the synthesis of α-chiral amines in optically pure\nform is of great importance for the pharmaceutical industry.\n1,2\nTherefore, several organometallic-, organo-, and photoredox-\ncatalysts possessing improved activity and selectivity have been\ndeveloped during the past 2 decades for the synthesis of α-\nchiral amines starting from prochiral substrates.\n3−16\nIn this\ncontext, biocatalysis has made a tremendous contribution since\nan arsenal of enzymes from different families is now available\nfor the synthesis of α-chiral amines in high optical purity;\n17−21\nthese enzyme families comprise hydrolases,\n22−24\nω-trans-\naminases,\n25−29\nammonia lyases,\n30,31\namine oxidases,\n19,32−35\nimine reductases/reductive aminases,\n36−38\namine dehydro-\ngenases,\n36,39\nengineered cytochromes P450,\n40−42\nand Pictet-\nSpenglerases.\n43−45\nAmong these methods, enzymatic reductive amination is of\ngreat interest since it permits synthesizing enantiomerically\npure primary, secondary, and tertiary amines through the\nreductive coupling of a prochiral ketone acceptor with an\namine donor. This feature enables access to a wide structural\ndiversity.\n36−39,46−72\nAs an alternative, the reductive amination\nof a non-prochiral substrate, such as an aldehyde, has been\ncombined with the kinetic resolution of a racemic amine\ndonor.\n73\nHowever, many valuable biologically active compounds\npossess multiple stereocenters and, therefore, are more\nchallenging to synthesize.\n2,74,75\nIn principle, these complex\nsyntheses can be accomplished by developing enzymatic\ncascades.\n76−81\nThe few available methods deal with the\nReceived: June 25, 2022\nRevised: October 20, 2022\nPublished: November 10, 2022\nResearch Articlepubs.acs.org/acscatalysis\n© 2022 The Authors.

These structural motives, found already in some\ncommercial pharmaceuticals (see Supporting Information,\nFigure S2), can be accessed through the asymmetric reduction\nof the alkene moiety of an α,β-unsaturated ketone using an\nene-reductase, followed by the reductive amination of the\ncarbonyl moiety. Ene-reductases (EReds) are flavin-dependent\nenzymes that catalyze the asymmetric reduction of activated\nalkenes, such as α,β-unsaturated aldehydes, ketones, and esters\n(also acids in particular cases), as well as cyano- and nitro-\nfunctionalized alkenes.\n87−93\nRiva’s group and Bornscheuer’s group independently\nreported the combination of EReds with ω-transaminases\n(ωTAs) for the synthesis of diastereomerically enriched\namines bearing two stereogenic centers.\n94,95\nThe former\ngroup performed the synthesis of two of the four possible\nstereoisomers of 3-methyl-4-phenylbutan-2-amine, 1-(chro-\nman-3-yl)ethan-1-amine, and 3-methylcyclohexan-1-amine\n(1c) in excellent diastereomeric ratios (d.r. 94:6 to\n>99:<1).\n94\nThe latter group focused specifically on the\nsynthesis of 1c and obtained three of the four stereoisomers\nwith moderate or high d.r. (86:14 to 98:2) by using two\nstereocomplementary EReds with one ωTA.\n95,96\nIn a recent\npublication, Paul’s group and Vergne-Vaxelaire’s group jointly\nreported the synthesis of α-chiral amines by combining EReds\nwith native amine dehydrogenases (AmDHs). They obtained\nfour structures of amine products containing two stereogenic\ncenters, but only one (or two in one case) of the four possible\nstereoisomers was obtained with variable values of d.r. (65:35\nto 99:1) and high e.r. (99:1).\n97\nNotably, due to the inherent catalytic activity of ωTAs or\nAmDHs, all the studies mentioned above could give access\nonly to primary α-chiral amines; furthermore, the possibility of\nsynthesizing all the four possible stereoisomers remained\nelusive. Turner, Parmeggiani, and co-workers reported an\nimportant extension of these synthetic strategies by accom-\nplishing the stereoselective synthesis of five-, six-, and seven-\nmembered ring N-heterocycles containing two stereocenters\n(Scheme 1A).\n98\nThis was the first example of the synthesis of\ncyclic tertiary chiral amines by combining an ERed with an\nScheme 1.

All four stereoisomers of one of the\ntarget amine products, namely 2-(sec-butyl)piperidine, were\nobtained in a diastereomerically enriched form (72:28 to\n86:14). In another outstanding and recently published work,\nTurner’s group reported the synthesis of secondary and tertiary\nβ-alkyl- and γ-alkyl-substituted α-chiral amines (Scheme 1B).\nMost notably, the reaction was catalyzed by a single\noxidoreductase exhibiting both ERed and IRed activities.\nThis family of enzymes, named EneIREDs, appears to give\naccess to one of the four possible stereoisomers starting from a\ngiven ketone substrate and an amine donor.\n99\nAlthough the\nsynthesis with a single oxidoreductase possessing dual activity\nis of practical convenience, the use of two separated ERed and\nIRed still has the advantage of enabling the creation of modular\ncascades in which all the stereoisomers of an amine product\nare, in principle, accessible by combining enzymes with\ndifferent stereoselectivities.\nIn this work, we developed a biocatalytic cascade for the\nasymmetric synthesis of primary, secondary, and tertiary\namines bearing two stereocenters by studying the combination\nof EReds with IReds/RedAms with a selected panel of α,β-\nunsaturated ketones and amine donors (Scheme 1C). In the\ncase of the reductive amination of 3-methylcyclohex-2-en-1-\none (1a, Scheme 1C) with different amine donors for the\nsynthesis of secondary and tertiary amine products, we\nobtained all the four possible stereoisomers with an excellent\ndiastereomeric and enantiomeric ratio. Furthermore, we\nintroduced the use of an NADP-dependent formate dehydro-\ngenase for the in situ recycling of the reduced form of the\nnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate co-factor\n(NADPH). This enabled avoiding the addition of glucose as\na sacrificial co-substrate because the ammonium or alkylam-\nmonium formate buffer was both the source of reducing\nequivalents and the amine donor.\n■\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nAsymmetric Alkene Moiety Reduction of α,β-Unsatu-\nrated Ketones (1−4a) Using a Panel of Ene-Reductases\n(EReds).

The reactions were conducted in HCOONH\n4\nand in HCOONH\n3\nCH\n3\nbuffers (1 M, at various pH and T values) as these are the required reaction environments for the final intended cascade.\nReactions in KPi buffer (50 mM, pH 8, 1 mL) were also performed to enable comparison and data analysis as this is the most applied buffer with\nEReds in the literature.\nb\nMeasured by GC−FID using an achiral column (DB-1701, 30 m, Agilent).\nc\nMeasured by GC−FID using a chiral column\n(Rt-bDEXsm, Restek for 1b, 3b, and 4b and Rt-bDEXsa, Restek for 2b).

This initial phase of the\nwork was important because the biocatalytic alkene reduction\nusing an NADP-dependent FDH for the in situ recycling of\nNADPH has not been previously reported. In fact, the widely\napplied strategy for NADPH recycling in this biocatalytic\nreaction has always been the use of a glucose dehydrogenase\n(GDH), which requires the consumption of one equivalent of\nglucose as the sacrificial co-substrate.\n87−91,93\nIn contrast, the\nuse of FDH/formate salt would result in a higher atom\neconomy (see Supporting Information, Section 3). This is even\nmore advantageous in the designed multi-enzyme cascade in\nwhich the asymmetric reduction of the alkene moiety is\nfollowed by asymmetric reductive amination, which ultimately\nrequires ammonium or alkylammonium formate as the only\nadditional reagent.\nWe first performed the alkene moiety reduction of 3-\nmethylcyclohex-2-en-1-one (1a) by testing the whole panel of\nNADP-dependent EReds: PETNR,\n102\nTOYE,\n103\nOYE2,\n104\nOYE3,\n104\nXenA,\n105,106\nXenB,\n105,106\nLeOPR1,\n107\nNerA,\n108\nGluOx,\n109\nYqjM,\n110\nMR,\n111\nand YqjM-v1\n112\nin KPi buffer.\nThe two NAD-dependent EReds (NerA and MR) were also\ntested for the same reaction in which NAD\n+\nwas recycled using\nthe wild-type Cb-FDH.\n113\nOYE2 and YqjM-v1 were the best-\nperforming EReds in terms of conversion and stereoselectivity\nfor the formation of (S) and (R)-1b, respectively (Table 1,\nentries 1 and 4; Supporting Information, Table S1). The\nobtained e.r. values agreed with the previously reported data\nusing GDH/glucose as a recycling system.\n112,114\nIn a few cases,\nthe formation of the phenol by-product 1b′ (Supporting\nInformation, Section 6.1) was observed, and this is due to the\npromiscuous disproportionation activity of some EReds on 1a,\nas described in the literature.\n115\nBecause the overall cascade\nreactions, comprising alkene reduction and carbonyl reductive\namination, must run in a formate buffer of the amine donor, we\ntested the alkene reduction using OYE2 and YqjM-v1 in\nammonium formate (HCOONH\n4\n) or methylammonium\nformate buffer (HCOONH\n3\nCH\n3\n) at a concentration of 1 M\nand a pH of 8.8. The change in the reaction buffer slightly\naffected the conversions, which decreased in the case of OYE2\nand increased in the case of YqjM-v1. In contrast, variation in\nthe enantiomeric ratios of (S) and (R)-1b was negligible\n(Table 1, entries 2,3 and 5−7). Significant phenol 1b′\nformation was observed only for OYE2. In summary, these\nresults demonstrated that both EReds and Cb-FDH-QRN are\ncompatible with a formate salt buffer of the amine donor that is\nrequired for the subsequent reductive amination of the\ncarbonyl moiety.\nWe conducted the same investigation on the next model\nsubstrate, namely 2-methylcyclohex-2-en-1-one (2a) in KPi\nbuffer. This substrate is more challenging because the related\nsaturated product 2b is an α-substituted ketone, which is\ntherefore prone to racemization due to keto−enol tautomer-\nism.\n100\nTOYE and XenB turned out to be the best enzymes in\nterms of the conversion and enantiomeric ratios at 10 °C\n(Table 1, entries 8 and 11; Supporting Information, Table\nS10). Notably, the reported values represent an improvement\ncompared with published data, in which the highest reported\ne.r. was 93:7 with this set of EReds.\n114,116\nTherefore, the\nbiocatalytic reactions with TOYE and XenB were further\ninvestigated in HCOONH\n4\nand in HCOONH\n3\nCH\n3\nbuffers at\nthe same temperatures (10, 20, and 30 °C) and different pH\nvalues (8 and 8.8; see Supporting Information, Table S11).\nThe change in the buffer composition resulted in an increased\nconversion into the product (R)-2b but a decrease in the e.r.\n(see Table 1, entries 9−10, 12−13). In general, (R)-2b was\nobtained in higher e.r. when the reaction was conducted at pH\n8 rather than pH 8.8 (see Supporting Information, Table S11).\nIn this work, we also proved that the variation in the ee values\nmust be (at least mainly) attributed not to an inherent change\nin the stereoselectivity of the EReds under different reaction\nconditions but to the different rate of the spontaneous\nchemical racemization of 2b (for details, see Supporting\nInformation, Section 7.1 and Table S12). The racemization\nrate of 2b depended partly on the temperature and pH, and it\nwas lower at a lower temperature and neutral pH. However, we\nnoticed that the type of buffer contributed more than the pH\nand temperature to the depletion of the e.e. The depletion of\nthe enantiomeric excess was also greater in HCOONH\n4\nthan\nin HCOONH\n3\nCH\n3\n.\nIn a similar way, we investigated the reduction of 3-\nmethylcyclopent-2-en-1-one (3a) in KPi buffer. In this case,\nPETNR and OYE2 were the best-performing EReds (Table 1,\nentries 14 and 17; see Supporting Information, Table S25, for\nthe full dataset). Switching the buffer to HCOONH\n4\nor\nHCOONH\n3\nCH\n3\ndid not affect the e.r., while the conversion\nwas increased by increasing the ERed concentrations (Table 1,\nentries 15, 16, 18, 19; Supporting Information, Table S25).\nFinally, YqjM-v1 produced the opposite enantiomer in all the\ntested buffers with low conversion and moderate e.r. (see\nTable 1, entries 20 and 21).\n(E)-3-methylpent-3-en-2-one (4a) was the last tested model\nof an α,β-unsaturated ketone substrate (see Supporting\nInformation, Table S31). XenA and YqjM-v1 were the best-\nperforming EReds for the synthesis of (S)-4b and (R)-4b in\nKPi buffer, respectively (Table 1, entries 22 and 25;\nSupporting Information, Table S31). The absolute config-\nuration of (S)-4b was assigned by measuring the optical\nrotation of a sample obtained from a 61 mg−scale reaction\ncatalyzed by wild-type YqjM (e.r. >97:<3 (S), 78% isolated\nyield due to the volatility of 4b) and by comparing with\nliterature data (see Supporting Information, Section 12.4.1).\n117\nAs in the case of 2b, the obtained (S)-4b is an α-substituted\nsaturated ketone and, therefore, prone to racemization in\nsolution. In fact, the same effect observed for the racemization\nof (R)-2b was observed for the racemization of (S)-4b.\nTherefore, the optimized reaction conditions in HCOONH\n4\nand HCOONH\n3\nCH\n3\nbuffers were found again at pH 8 and 10\n°C (Table 1, entries 23 and 24; Supporting Information, Table\nS31). The saturated ketone 4b was also obtained in\nquantitative conversions and in an (R)-configured enantioen-\nriched form by using YqjM-v1 (see Table 1, entries 26−28).\nAsymmetric Reductive Amination of Saturated\nKetones (1−4b) Using a Panel of Imine Reductases\n(IReds) and Amine Dehydrogenases (AmDHs) to Give\nPrimary Amines (1−4c). A panel of 16 imine reductases\n(IReds)\n46,48,118,119\nand three amine dehydrogenases\n(AmDHs)\n59−62\nof known amino acid sequences was tested\nfor the reductive amination of the saturated ketones 1−4b (for\na description of these enzymes, such as strains of origin, see\nSupporting Information, Section 4). Although most of these\nexperiments were conducted using racemic ketones 1−4b, we\npoint out that reductive amination will eventually run on\nenantiomerically pure or enriched ketones 1−4b in the final\ncascades. Therefore, it is more important that the IReds or\nAmDHs can install the additional stereogenic center by\nACS Catalysis pubs.acs.org/acscatalysis Research Article\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.2c03052\nACS Catal. 2022, 12, 14459−14475\n14462\nreducing the carbonyl moiety with high stereoselectivity than\nthat they can distinguish the existing chirality of the substrate\nat the other carbon atom. We performed the biocatalytic\nreductive aminations of the ketone substrates in HCOONH\n4\nbuffer (1 M, pH 8.8) with an aminating enzyme at 30 °C for\n24 h. As the 16 IReds were reported to be NADP dependent,\nNADP\n+\nand Cb-FDH-QRN were added again for co-factor\nrecycling. In the case of the AmDHs, namely Ch1-AmDH, Rh-\nPhAmDH, and LE-AmDH-v1, NAD\n+\nand wild-type Cb-FDH\nwere added because the three AmDHs prefer NADH as a co-\nfactor. We initially hypothesized that the reductive amination\nof racemic 3-methylcyclohexan-1-one (rac-1b) would have led\nto a mixture of diastereomers of 1c because the absolute\nconfiguration at the substrate’s β-carbon atom was supposed to\nnot strongly influence the stereoselectivity of the hydride\ntransfer from NADPH to the protonated imine intermediate in\nthe active site of the enzymes. In contrast, the reaction with\nIRED-10, for example, yielded only a couple of cis\nenantiomers, namely (1S,3R)-1c and (1R,3S)-1c, with a total\nconversion of 94%, the remaining compound being unreacted\nrac-1b (see Figure 1A, entry 3, and Supporting Information,\nTables S2 and S44, for the full dataset). This means that IRED-\n10 can efficiently aminate both enantiomers of 1b, but the\nabsolute configuration of the newly created stereogenic center\n(α-chiral carbon to the amine moiety) is controlled by the\nabsolute configuration of the pre-existing stereogenic carbon\natom of ketone substrate 1b. Turner’s group has previously\nobserved this type of “substrate-controlled” stereoselectivity in\nthe reductive amination of 2,6-, 2,5-, and 2,4-disubstituted\npiperideine catalyzed by IReds.\n120\nAlso, in their case, the\ninherent selectivity of the IReds was overridden by the existing\nchirality at the methyl-substituted carbon atom. The authors\npostulated that the hydride attacks the cyclic imine anti-\nperiplanar to the methyl substituent to avoid a steric clash.\nAccordingly, it appears in our study that substrate 1b binds to\nthe IRED-10’s active site in such a way that the hydride is also\ntransferred from NADPH antiperiplanary to the methyl\nsubstituent (Scheme 2). Therefore, the amination of the\nenantiomer (R)-1b with IRED-10 proceeded toward the Re-\nface of the carbonyl moiety to give (1S,3R)-1c, while the\nFigure 1.

The reactions were conducted in HCOONH\n4\nbuffer (1 M, pH 8.8) at a T of 30 °C for 24 h with a catalytic amount of either NADP\n+\nor NAD\n+\n(0.25 mM) and a suitable formate dehydrogenase\n(FDH 5 μM) for co-factor recycling.\nACS Catalysis pubs.acs.org/acscatalysis Research Article\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.2c03052\nACS Catal. 2022, 12, 14459−14475\n14463\namination of the (S)-1b proceeded toward the Si-face of the\ncarbonyl moiety to give (1R,3S)-1c.\nThis finding was also supported by the reductive amination\nof enantiopure (R)-1b catalyzed by IRED-10, which afforded\n(1S,3R)-1c as the only stereoisomer in quantitative conversion\n(see Figure 1B, entry 12, and Supporting Information, Tables\nS3 and S44, for the full dataset). The other enzymes that\nperformed well in terms of conversion for the amination of rac-\n1b were IRED-1, 5, 13, 15, 20, 22, and 25 (conversions 22−\n99%). In general, the formation of cis-configured isomers of 1c\nwas prevalent with most tested IReds, but varied amounts of\ntrans-1c were also formed (Figure 1A, entries 1 and 3−8; see\nalso Supporting Information, Table S2, for more data). In fact,\nonly in three out of 19 cases was an equal ratio between the cis\nand trans diastereomers obtained, namely with IRED-5, LE-\nAmDH-v1, and IRED-30; the remaining compound was always\nunreacted rac-1b (Figure 1A, entries 2 and 9, for the selected\ndata; see also Supporting Information, Tables S2 and S44, for\nthe full dataset). The amine dehydrogenase Ch1-AmDH was\nthe only enzyme that yielded a higher concentration of the\ntrans enantiomer couple (77:23 d.r.; see Supporting\nInformation, Table S2, for the full dataset). When we\nperformed the reductive amination starting from (R)-1b, the\npreferentially formed product with the active IReds was the\nexpected (1S,3R)-1c (d.r. varying from 73:27 to >99.5:<0.5)\n(Figure 1B for the selected data; see Supporting Information,\nTable S3, for the full dataset). In conclusion, based on the\nresults from Supporting Information Tables S2 and S3, IRED-\n1, 5, 10, 13, 15, 20, 22, and 25 were selected to test the overall\ncascade from 1a to 1c stereoisomers, which will be reported in\nthe next section.\nThe reductive amination of racemic 2-methylcyclohexan-1-\none (rac-2b) in HCOONH\n4\nbuffer was performed under the\nsame reaction conditions as for the reductive amination of rac-\n1b. IRED-20 and IRED-22 led to quantitative conversion into\n2c with a diastereomeric ratio of 82:18 and 68:32, respectively\n(see Figure 1C, entries 22 and 23, and Supporting Information,\nTable S44). The other IReds that yielded a significant\nconversion (22−92%), namely IRED-10, 13, 14, and 15, also\nexhibited a non-equal diastereomeric ratio (see Supporting\nInformation, Table S13, for the full dataset). Although the\nrationalization of the stereochemical outcome of the reaction\nfor the synthesis of 2c is more complicated than for the\nsynthesis of 1c due to the occurrence of keto−enol\ntautomerisms for 2b, as previously discussed, most of the\nIReds produced mainly the trans-configured isomers [i.e.,\n(1S,2S) and (1R,2R)-2c)], as depicted in Figure 1C (entries\n19−23). This indicates that the hydride transfer from NADPH\noccurs prevalently syn-periplanar to the methyl substituent for\n2-methyl-substituted cyclohexane. However, four IReds\npreferentially formed the cis-configured isomers of 2c, of\nwhich IRED-10 yielded the highest conversion (Figure 1C,\nentry 18). Only Ch1-AmDH selectively yielded only cis-2c (see\nSupporting Information, Table S13, for the full dataset). The\nIReds reported in Figure 1C were selected to test the overall\ncascade from 2a to 2c stereoisomers.\nRacemic 3-methylcyclopentan-1-one (rac-3b) turned out to\nbe a challenging substrate for the reductive amination with\nammonia as an amine donor since it was converted only by\nIRED-20 and 22 (Figure 1D, entries 24 and 25; see Supporting\nInformation, Tables S26 and S44, for the full dataset).\nTherefore, these two IReds were selected to test the overall\ncascade from 3a to 3c stereoisomers. In contrast, 15 out of 16\nIReds could aminate rac-3b when methylamine was used as the\namine donor. This interesting finding is described in detail in\nthe next section.\nRacemic (E)-3-methylpent-3-en-2-one (rac-4b) was also\naminated only by an amine dehydrogenase (Ch1-AmDH) and\nan imine reductase (IRED-20) when we used ammonia as an\namine donor. Ch1-AmDH produced an equal mixture of 4c\ndiastereomers and IRED-20 afforded 68:32 d.r., while the\nremaining compound was always unreacted 4b (Figure 1E,\nentries 26 and 27; see Supporting Information, Tables S32 and\nS44, for the full dataset). Therefore, these two enzymes were\nselected to test the overall cascade from 4a to 4c stereo-\nisomers. Like rac-3b, rac-4b was better accepted by the IReds\nwhen methylamine was used as an amine donor (eight out of\n16 enzymes) instead of ammonia. The analysis of these results\nis reported in the next section.\nAsymmetric Reductive Amination of Saturated\nKetones (1−4b) Using a Panel of Imine Reductases\n(IReds) to Give Secondary Amines (1−4d). The same\npanel of IReds and LE-AmDH-v1 was tested for the reductive\namination of rac-1b with methylamine as an amine donor. The\namine donor was again supplied as a component of the\nreaction buffer HCOONH\n3\nCH\n3\n(1 M, pH 8.8). As observed\nfor the reaction with ammonia as an amine donor, the absolute\nconfiguration of the β-carbon of 1b influenced the stereo-\nselectivity of the reductive amination. In particular, IRED-5,\n11, 13, 15, 20, 22, 25, and 30 yielded quantitative conversion\nwith variable ratios of cis/trans diastereomers. The formation\nof cis-1d prevailed over the formation of trans-1d in 14 out of\n17 cases (Figure 2A, entries 1−9; see Supporting Information,\nTables S4 and S45, for the full dataset). When we conducted\nthe same reaction starting from (R)-1b, quantitative con-\nversion was observed with most of the IReds (Figure 2B,\nentries 10−19; see Supporting Information, Tables S5 and\nS45, for the full dataset). However, only IRED-10 and IRED-\n11 yielded (1S,3R)-1d in high optical purity (98:2 d.r. or\n>99:<1 d.r; entries 11 and 12). The assignment of the absolute\nconfiguration of the enantiomers of 1d was accomplished by\nfollowing a strategy that was developed in this work and is\ndescribed in the Supporting Information, Section 12.1.2 and\nFigure S5.\nBased on the results from Supporting Information Tables S4\nand S5, IRED-5, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 20, 22, 30, and AspRedAm\nwere selected to test the overall cascade from 1a to 1d\nstereoisomers.\nThe reductive amination of rac-2b in HCOONH\n3\nCH\n3\nwas\nperformed under the same reaction conditions as for the\nreductive amination of rac-1b. IRED-20, 22, and 30 yielded\nScheme 2.

In all these cases, the trans-\nisomers (1R,2R, and 1S,2S) were prevalently formed, as\npreviously observed for the amination of rac-2b with ammonia\nas an amine donor. IRED-5, 10, 11, 13, 14, and AspRedAm\nalso yielded significant conversions (40−97%) (see Figure 2C\nFigure 2.

Notably, IRED-13 and 14 favored the formation of\ncis-2d, in contrast to all the other IReds (see Figure 2C, entries\n23 and 24, and Supporting Information, Table S14, for a\ncomplete analysis). All the IReds depicted in Figure 2C were\nselected to test the overall cascade from 2a to 2d stereo-\nisomers.\nAs briefly anticipated in the previous section, the reductive\namination of rac-3b in HCOONH\n3\nCH\n3\nwas successful with\nmost of the tested IReds, in contrast to the amination with\nammonia as an amine donor. IRED-11, 15, 20, and 22 yielded\nquantitative conversion (Figure 2D, entries 32, 35, 36, and 37).\nIRED-5, 10, 13, 14, 30, and AspRedAm also yielded significant\nconversion (44−98%; see Figure 2D and Supporting\nInformation, Tables S27 and S45, for the full dataset).\nTherefore, all these IReds were selected to test the overall\ncascade from 3a to 3d stereoisomers.\nAs anticipated in the previous section, the reductive\namination of rac-4b in HCOONH\n3\nCH\n3\nwas also more\nsuccessful than in HCOONH\n4\nbuffer. We observed conversion\nwith eight IReds (4−51%), namely IRED-5, 13, 14, 15, 20, 22,\n30, and 32, with again a non-equal diastereomeric ratio in all\nthe cases (see Figure 2E and Supporting Information, Tables\nS33 and S45, for the full dataset). IRED-20 yielded the highest\nconversion (Figure 2E, entry 44). Either one of the two\nenantiomeric couples of 4d was prevalently obtained depend-\ning on the IRed used. All the IReds except IRED-15 depicted\nin Figure 2E were selected to test the overall cascade from 4a\nto 4d stereoisomers.\nBiocatalytic Cascade Combining EReds and IReds for\nthe Conversion of α,β-Unsaturated Ketones (1−4a) into\nChiral Primary Amines (1−4c) Containing Two Stereo-\ngenic Centers. The cascade reaction from 1a to give 1c in\nhigh optical purity was first tested by combining OYE2, as one\nof the best-performing EReds for alkene moiety reduction\n(Table 1, entry 2), with the selected best-performing IReds for\nreductive amination (Figure 1A,B). We performed this one-pot\nconcurrent cascade in the HCOONH\n4\nbuffer (1 M, pH 8.8)\nwith 1a at 30 °C for 24 h. The best combinations in terms of\nconversion and stereoselective outcome of the reaction were\nOYE2 with either IRED-10 or 22. Both combinations yielded\n(1R,3S)-1c in excellent conversions and stereoselectivities\n(Table 2, entries 1 and 2). For the full dataset with a detailed\ncomposition of the reaction mixtures, see Supporting\nInformation, Tables S6 and S7. Notably, (1R,3S)-1c could\npreviously be obtained at a maximum of 94:6 d.r. or 95:5 d.r. in\ntwo independently conducted studies using the more complex\nω-transaminase-based amination system.\n94,95\nFurthermore, the\n(1R,3S) stereoisomer of 1c has not previously been obtained\nwith any other cascade using dehydrogenase enzymes.\n97\nEven\nthe recently discovered EneIREDs were reported to produce a\ntrans-configured stereoisomer (i.e., 1R,3R) for the reactions\nstarting from 3-substituted cyclohexanone as substrates similar\nto 1a.\n99\nTherefore, the combinations of OYE2 with either\nIRED-10 or -22 are currently the only ones that can deliver\n(1R,3S)-1c (a cis-isomer) in excellent optical purity.\nBecause the ene-reductase YqjM-v1 has the opposite\nstereoselectivity from that of OYE2 in the reduction of 1a to\n1b (Table 1, entry 5), we investigated the cascades combining\nYqjM-v1 with the best-performing IReds for the reductive\namination at 20 °C. The best combinations were YqjM-v1\ncombined with IRED-10, 13, 15, or 25 (Table 2, entries 3−6),\nthus leading to the quantitative conversion of (1S,3R)-1c (the\nother cis-isomer) with excellent d.r. and e.r. For the full dataset\nwith a detailed composition of the reaction mixtures, see\nSupporting Information, Tables S6 and S7. (1S,3R)-1c is\ncurrently unattainable by combining EReds with ωTAs due to\nthe lack of an ωTA possessing suitable stereoselectivity toward\nTable 2.

As previously reported, the\nreduced temperature and buffer concentration led to a\nsignificant decrease in the catalytic activity of all the tested\nIReds (IRED-10, 13, 14, 15, 20, 22, and 25) in the cascade\nreaction with TOYE (see Supporting Information, Tables S15\nand S16, for details). This resulted in a maximum of 32% total\nconversion with the trans-configured isomer (1R,2R)-2c as the\nmajor stereoisomer. Notably, the previously reported EneIRED\nenzymes favored the formation of a cis-isomer (i.e., (1S,2R)) in\nthe case of the tested 2-substituted cyclohexenone substrate,\nthus again highlighting the complementarity of our ERed/IRed\ncascade approach in terms of stereoselectivity.\n99\nHowever,\naiming at improving the conversion, we decided to test the\nreaction from 2a to 2c in a one-pot two-stage cascade (i.e., a\none-pot two-step separated in time). In the first stage of the\none-pot cascade, TOYE, Cb-FDH-QRN, NADP\n+\n, HCOONa,\nand substrate 2a were incubated in KPi buffer (1 mL, pH 7, 50\nmM) at 10 °C for 24 h. In the next stage, HCOONH\n4\nbuffer\n(1 mL, 1 M, pH 7) containing IRed, Cb-FDH-QRN, and\nNADP\n+\nwas added directly to the previous solution and\nincubated at 20 °C for 24 h. The best combination in terms of\nconversion and stereoselectivities was TOYE with IRED-22\n(Table 2, entry 7). For the full dataset with detailed\nprocedures, see Supporting Information, Tables S17−S20.\nFor the cascade reaction from 3a to 3c, OYE2, rather than\nPETNR, was selected since the former ene-reductase yielded a\nhigher conversion (see Table 1). The reaction was performed\nin a one-pot concurrent two-step mode; thus, the alkene\nreduction and reductive amination run simultaneously in this\ncase. The combination of OYE2 with each of the IReds in\nHCOONH\n4\nbuffer (1 mL, 1 M, pH 8) led to measurable\nconversions only in two cases, namely OYE2 and IRED-20 or\nOYE2 and IRED-22 (Table 2, entry 8; Supporting\nInformation, Table S28). All our efforts to analytically separate\nall the four possible stereoisomers of 3c were unsuccessful.\nHowever, we could separate the two couples of enantiomers\nfrom each other, thus determining a d.r. of 95:5. We could\nthen infer an e.r. value of >99:<1 based on the single alkene\nreduction step catalyzed by OYE2 (Table 1).

The synthesis of\nsecondary amines starting from α,β-unsaturated ketones is not\npossible using EReds combined with either ωTA or AmDH as\nthese enzymes can produce only primary amines.\n25−29,36,37,39\nThe formation of N-methyl secondary amines with an AmDH\nwas documented in one of our publications, albeit with\nimperfect chemo- and stereo-selectivity and a constrained\nsubstrate scope.\n121\nIn contrast, IReds can effectively give access\nto secondary and even tertiary amines by reductive amination\nof ketones,\n36−39,46−56\na feature that we decided to explore in\nthis work for the synthesis of secondary amines possessing two\nstereogenic centers. For this purpose, we first investigated the\ncascade reaction from 1a to yield optically active 1d by\ncombining either OYE2 or YqjM-v1�as the best-performing\nEReds possessing opposite stereoselectivity for the reduction\nof 1a to 1b (Table 1, entries 1−7)�with each of the best-\nperforming IReds for the reductive amination of ketone 1b\nwith methylamine as an amine donor (Figure 2A,B). The one-\npot concurrent cascade was conducted in the HCOONH\n3\nCH\n3\nbuffer (1 M, pH 8.8) under the same conditions as described\nfor the cascade from 1a to 1c in HCOONH\n4\nbuffer. Notably,\n(1R,3S)-1d was obtained in quantitative conversion and\nexcellent stereoselectivity by combining OYE2 with AspRe-\ndAm as IRed (Table 3, entry 1). The combination of OYE2\nwith IRED-11 yielded the same product with a slightly lower\nconversion and d.r., albeit with the same e.r. (Table 3, entry 2).\nThe other enantiomer product (1S,3R)-1d was also obtained\nin quantitative conversion and elevated stereoselectivity\nthrough the combination of YqjM-v1 with IRED-10 (Table\n3, entry 3). The combination of YqjM-v1 with IRED-11\nyielded the product with the same absolute configuration,\nagain in quantitative yield, but a slightly lower d.r. and e.r.\n(Table 3, entry 4). For the full dataset, see Supporting\nInformation, Tables S8 and S9. Notably, our ERed/IRed\ncascades afforded the synthesis of the two cis-configured\nstereoisomers of 1d in excellent optical purity, which have not\npreviously been synthesized. This result again highlights the\ncomplementarity between the ERed/IRed cascade and the\nreaction catalyzed by EneIRED, as the latter strategy always\ngives access to a trans-stereoisomer product (i.e., 1R,3R) in the\nconversion of 1,3-alkyl-substituted cyclohexenones to yield the\nrelated secondary amines.\n99\nBased on the previously discussed results for the conversion\nof 2a into 2c, we again performed the biocatalytic cascade from\n2a to 2d in a one-pot sequential two-step mode. The\ncombination of TOYE with several IReds, namely IRED-5,\n11, 20, 30, and AspRedAm, produced quantitative conversion\ngiving (1R,2R)-2d as the main stereoisomer in excellent d.r.\nand e.r. (Table 3, entries 5−9). For the full dataset with\ndetailed procedures, see Supporting Information, Tables S21−\nS24. A complementarity in the observed absolute configuration\nof the obtained product was again observed between the\nERed/IRed cascade and the EneIRED enzyme. Our cascade\nyielded one trans-configured stereoisomer (i.e., (1R,2R)-2d),\nwhile EneIRED was reported in one case to yield a cis-\nconfigured 1,2 methyl-substituted secondary amine (i.e., the\n(1S,2R) configuration).\n99\nAs methylamine was generally better accepted than\nammonia as an amine donor for the reductive amination of\nrac-3b with the IReds, the cascade from 3a to 3d with OYE2\nled to successful conversions with more aminating enzymes,\nnamely IRED-5, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 20, 22, 30, and AspRedAm\n(see Supporting Information, Table S29). In particular, the\none-pot concurrent two-step reaction using OYE2 combined\nwith IRED-20 led to the quantitative conversion of 3d within\n24 h. One major stereoisomer was detected with 99:1 d.r.,\nwhile the e.r. was inferred to be >99:<1 from the previous\nalkene reduction step (Table 3, entry 10). Notably, the\nopposite diastereomer was obtained in 56% conversion and\nexcellent stereoselectivity by combining OYE2 with IRED-15\n(Table 3, entry 11). This latter conversion became quantitative\nby applying a one-pot two-step sequential protocol and\nincreasing the concentration of IRED-15 (Table 3, entry 12;\nfor details see Supporting Information, Table S30). In\nsummary, the two cascades with OYE2 and IRED-20 or with\nOYE2 and IRED-15 led to two diastereomers with the same\nabsolute configuration at the C-3 atom (S) and the opposite\nconfiguration at the C-1 atom. The absolute configuration of\nthis latter carbon atom was determined by NOESY\n1\nH NMR\nspectroscopic studies (see Supporting Information, Section\n12.3.3, for an extended explanation), concluding that OYE2/\nIRED-20 and OYE2/IRED-15 led to (1R,3S)-3d (cis) and\n(1S,3S)-3d (trans), respectively.\nThe last cascade from 4a to 4d was performed following the\none-pot sequential two-step approach to again minimize any\npossible in situ racemization of the α-substituted, α-chiral\nketone intermediate 4b. Although the control experiment for\nthe reduction of the alkene moiety of 4a catalyzed by XenA led\nto 4b in 96:4 e.r., the overall cascade from 4a to 4d gave the\nfinal product with 89:11 e.r.; this signifies that partial\nracemization at the C-α to the carbonyl moiety occurred\nduring reductive amination (for details, see Supporting\nInformation, Table S36). Therefore, we investigated the single\nreduction of the alkene moiety catalyzed by XenA at pH 7 in\neither KPi or HCOOCH\n3\nNH\n3\nbuffer.

All the four α,β-unsaturated\nketones (1−4a) were tested as possible substrates for this\ncascade, and the reactions were performed following the one-\npot sequential two-step approach. Therefore, the asymmetric\nreduction of the alkene moiety of substrates 1−4a was\nconducted using the best-performing enzymes, as reported in\nTable 1, in KPi buffer (50 mM, pH 7.5, 1 mL) at 30 °C for 24\nh.

In general, the final molar ratio between\nthe substrate and the amine donor was 1 to 10. This ratio\nbetween the carbonyl compound acceptor and the amine\ndonor is in the range of the catalytic activity reported for\nreductive aminase enzymes (see Supporting Information,\nSection 10, for details).\n46\nAmong the tested combinations, only the cascades starting\nfrom 1a yielded the desired final amine products (Figure 3).\nNotably, we observed a typical trend regarding the acceptance\nof the intermediates (R)-1b or (S)-1b by the IReds. Regardless\nof the structure of the amine donor d3−6, (R)-1b was\npreferentially accepted by IRED-10, 20, and 30. Additionally,\nIRED-5 catalyzed the synthesis of 1-((3R)-3-\nmethylcyclohexyl)pyrrolidine diastereomers (1e) with higher\nconversion, albeit with lower d.r. than IRED-30. In contrast,\n(S)-1b was preferentially accepted by IRED-15 and AspRe-\ndAm. The only exception was the synthesis of 1-((3S)-3-\nmethylcyclohexyl)pyrrolidine diastereomers (1e), for which\nIRED-14 and 32 were the best-performing aminating enzymes.\nConsidering the data for the reduction from 1a to give (R)- or\n(S)-1b catalyzed by ERed and the data for the reductive\namination catalyzed by IRed to give the final products 1e−h,\nwe observed that all the four possible stereoisomers were\nobtained in perfect or highly enriched optical purity in most of\nthe cases. This fact exemplifies the stereochemical synthetic\nversatility of the dual-enzyme (ERed−IRed) approach because\nstereogenic centers with all of the different absolute\nconfigurations could be installed. This result has not previously\nbeen obtained for the synthesis of chiral amines bearing two\nstereogenic centers. For instance, the recently discovered\nEneIReds generally yield one of the trans-configured products\nstarting from substrates such as 1a.\n99\nTable 4 and Supporting\nInformation Table S43 report the selected data and the full\ndataset for these one-pot sequential two-step cascades. Finally,\nFigure 4 depicts the composition of the product mixtures by\nhighlighting the formation of the main stereoisomer versus all\nof the other stereoisomers.\n■\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn this work, we have presented an enzymatic cascade that\ncombined EReds with IReds/RedAms for the conversion of\nα,β-unsaturated ketones into primary, secondary, and tertiary\namines containing two stereogenic centers in very high\nchemical purity, diastereomeric ratios, and enantiomeric ratios.\nIt is noteworthy that the chemoselectivity of the reactions was\nalso excellent when the cascades were run in a concurrent\nmode because the possible amino-alkene by-product was never\nobserved. Compared with previously reported strategies, our\nstrategy could access, in many cases, more or even all of the\npossible stereoisomers of the amine products while also\navoiding the relevant formation of any side-product.\n98\nThis was\npossible due to the large pool of tested EReds and IReds and\nthe thorough testing and optimization of the reaction\nconditions. Incidentally, the cascade reaction was also\nperformed at a 30 mg scale for the synthesis of (1R,3S)-1c\nfrom 1a (70% overall yield) and at a >50 mg scale for the\nsynthesis of (1S,3S)-3d and (1R,3S)-3d from 3a (98 to >99%\nconversion). Another important aspect was the utilization, for\nthe first time in such reactions, of an NADP-dependent FDH\nfor the in situ recycling of the NADPH co-factor. The FDH\nenables the atom efficiency of the reaction to be improved\nsince the ammonium or alkylammonium buffer is also the\nsource of the amine donor and reducing equivalents.\nFurthermore, FDH was found to be very stable under the\nrequired reaction conditions (e.g., high concentrations of\nammonium or alkylammonium species and a wide range of pH\nvalues), which is not generally the case for the reported glucose\ndehydrogenases.\n97\nNotably, our dual-enzyme ERed/IRed strategy exhibits a\ncomplementarity with the recently reported EneIRED enzymes\nfor the synthesis of cyclic six-membered ring amines. While our\nERed/IRed method afforded the synthesis of trans-1,2 and cis-\n1,3 substituted cyclohexylamines, the EneIRED method\nafforded the synthesis of one cis-1,2 and one trans-1,3\nstereoisomer.\n99\nFurthermore, as a proof of concept, we could\nobtain all four possible stereoisomers when 3-methylcyclohex-\n2-en-1-one (1a) was converted into secondary and tertiary\nchiral amines, thus highlighting the modularity and potential\nversatility of our approach. In general, this work highlights the\npotential of enzyme cascades for the highly selective synthesis\nof complex molecules possessing multiple stereogenic centers.\nFuture research must focus on the engineering and discovery\nof more EReds and IReds possessing complementary stereo-\nselectivity, improved stability, and a broader substrate scope.\nSuch research efforts will elevate the impact of biocatalytic\nretrosynthesis on the sustainable synthesis of chiral organic\nmolecules.\n122−125\n■\nASSOCIATED CONTENT\n*\nsı\nSupporting Information\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at\nhttps://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscatal.2c03052.\nSupporting Information contains the following: general\ninformation; procedures for enzyme expression and\npurification; general methods (with alkene moiety\nreductions, reductive aminations, and enzymatic syn-\nthesis of analytical reference compounds); experimental\nprocedures and full datasets for biocatalytic reactions\nwith substrates 1a,b, substrates 2a,b, substrates 3a,b, and\nsubstrates 4a,b with ammonia (d1) and methylamine\n(d2) as amine donors; experimental procedures and full\ndatasets for biocatalytic reactions with amine donors\nd3−6; summary tables; chemical and chemo-enzymatic\nsynthesis of reference compounds and scale-up enzy-\nmatic reductive amination, analytical methods, and\nrepresentative GC chromatograms (PDF)\n■\nAUTHOR INFORMATION\nCorresponding Authors\nTanja Knaus − Van’t Hoff Institute for Molecular Sciences,\nHIMS-Biocat, University of Amsterdam, 1098 XH\nAmsterdam, The Netherlands;\n orcid.org/0000-0001-\n9942-9226; Email: t.knaus@uva.nl\nFrancesco G.

The employed biocatalysts\ninclude IREDs, lipases, transaminases, ammonia dehydrogenases,\nand monoamine oxidases\n2,3. Since IREDs were discovered in\n20104, they have attracted the catalytic research community for\ntheir potential application in the asymmetric synthesis of chiral\namines5,6. Recently, reductive aminases are identiﬁed as a sub-\nfamily of IREDs by Turner and co-workers7, which could create\ndiverse chiral amines through reductive aminations of carbonyl\nand amine donors provided in equal stoichiometric ratio\n(Fig. 1a)7. Based on the broad substrate scope, IREDs have been\nengineered for industrial production of LSD1 inhibitor\nGSK2879552 and JAK1 inhibitor abrocitinib 8,9. Thus, IREDs\nbecome an efﬁcient and economical way to rapidly construct\nchiral amine products8,10–17.\nHowever, the industrial application of IREDs is mainly\nrestricted by limited substrate scope, especially low activities\ntowards bulky amines18. For example, the ﬁrst characterized\nAspRedAm showed excellent activities towards small amines,\nsuch as cyclopropylamine, propargylamine, and allylamine, but\nexhibited poor activities towards large and sterically hindered\namines7,18. Speciﬁcally, for piperidine, benzylamine, and aniline,\nAspRedAm retained only around 10% activity compared to pro-\npargylamine when they were reacting with the active carbonyl\ndonor cyclohexanone (Fig. 1b)7. Furthermore, AspRedAm dis-\nplayed no activity towards those amines reacting with the more\nchallenging carbonyl donor 4-phenyl-2-butanone 7. However,\nonly a few IREDs showed good transforming activities when\nusing benzylamine as amine donor in the previous studies13,15.\nDue to the increasing desire for biocatalysts for the synthesis of\nAPIs, designing a comprehensive screening to identify IREDs\nfavoring bulky amines is of great practical signiﬁcance.\nAs more and more IREDs are reported, screening of the pro-\nmising enzyme for subsequent engineering and industrial appli-\ncation is a laborious job. In this study, a rapid protocol of\nIncreasing-Molecule-Volume-Screening was constructed. Using\nIncreasing-Molecule-Volume-Screening, we identi ﬁed three\nIREDs with the preference towards bulky amine substrates. We\nfurther evaluated their abilities for the synthesis of APIs, together\nwith their application to the gram-scale synthesis of a bulkyN-\nalkylated benzylamine. The X-ray crystallography provides\ninsight into the structural basis of the substrate preference. This\nstudy expands and deepens the research aimed at applying IREDs\nfor asymmetric reductive amination reactions.\nResults and discussion\nSequence diversity of IREDs. To investigate the preference of\nIREDs in reductive amination towards different amine substrates,\nAspRedAm and 85 reported IREDs in our lab were selected\n(Supplementary Fig. 1)19. All 86 IREDs already showed excellent\nactivities towards certain substrates7,13,15,17,20, which made them\nbeing a good starting point for this study. Previous studies of\nthose enzymes mainly focused on small amines\n8,10–17, including\nmethylamine, dimethylamine, cyclopropylamine, butylamine,\nisopropylamine, allylamine, pyrrolidine, piperidine, and pro-\npargylamine, etc. Screenings were also performed towards\narylamines7,15,18. For instance, IR-G02, IR-G03, IR-G04, IR-G05,\nand IR-G08, showed excellent (>90%) conversions towards ary-\nlamines, including benzylamine, aniline, and 3-aminopyridine14.\nHowever, more bulky amines have rarely been examined.\nIdentifying IREDs for bulky amines. All 86 IREDs were suc-\ncessfully obtained by expressing their genes inE. coliBL21(DE3).\nSubsequently, their catalytic potential toward bulky amines was\nexplored by using Increasing-Molecule-Volume-Screening. It is a\nrapid protocol to screen the preferable substrate size of IREDs by\nsynthesizing a group of targeted products with increasing volumes.\nWe targeted ﬁve structures (Fig.2): i) 1A , 1B,a n d1C could be\nsynthesized from the active carbonyl donor cyclohexanone1 with\nincreasingly-bulkier amines, cyclopropylamine A, thiophene-2-\nethylamine B, and tryptamineC, respectively; ii)2C and 3C could\nbe synthesized from the amineC with the non-active and bulkier\nFig. 1 Synthesis of chiral amines by IREDs. aIREDs are capable of catalyzing imine formation and imine reduction to generate a wide variety of chiral\namines. b The reported relative activities ofAspRedAms towards propargylamine and larger amines piperidine, benzylamine, and aniline.\nARTICLE COMMUNICATIONS CHEMISTRY | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42004-022-00743-y\n2 COMMUNICATIONS CHEMISTRY|           (2022) 5:123 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42004-022-00743-y | www.nature.com/commschem\ncarbonyls, adamantanone2 and 5-methoxy-2-tetralone3,r e s p e c -\ntively. An equimolar ration of carbonyl and amine were used for all\nreactions (Supplementary Method 1). Conversions have been\ndetermined by comparison of the peak areas of UV absorption or\nextract ions of amine products with standard amins using HPLC or\nLC-MS (Supplementary Method 2 and Supplementary Data 3).\nIn the reductive aminations of1 with A, B, andC, the number\nof enzyme hits (conv. >20%) has fallen signiﬁcantly with the\naddition of bulkier amines. As shown in Fig.2, the number of\nenzyme hits for1A , 1B, and1C were 78, 39, and 13, respectively\n(Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). Similarly,AspRedAm gave a\n>90% conversion for1 with A, however, only 19% conversion and\n<5% conversion was observed for 1 with B and with C,\nrespectively. These results conﬁrmed the low tolerance of IREDs\nfor bulky amines. Further analysis indicated only 9 and 5 enzyme\nhits were observed for2C and 3C , respectively, while the rest of\nthe enzymes exhibited weak or no measurable activities.\nThe activities of most enzymes are negatively correlated with the\nvolumes of targeting molecules,such as IR-G08, IR-G13, and IR-G39,\nwhich were active for1A , 1B,a n d1C , but lost activities for2C and\n3C (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table 1). Only a few untypical\nexamples, such as IR-G11 and IR-G49, showed better activities\ntowards certain targets with larger volumes. Thus, the Increasing-\nMolecule-Volume-Screening could rapidly evaluate the tolerance of\nIREDs towards bulky substrates. Finally, only three IREDs were\nobtained: IR-G02, 21, and 35. Theywere constantly active for all\nreactions and all displayed >50% conversions for1, 2,a n d3 with C.\nPhylogenetic and bioinformatic analysis suggested the IREDs IR-\nG02 (Streptomyces albidoﬂavus), IR-21 (Saccharothrix espanaensis),\nand IR-35 (Allokutzneria albata) were all derived from actinomy-\ncetes and belonged to the same evolutionary branch with sequence\nidentity ranging from 40 to 44% (Supplementary Fig. 2). Overall,\nthe IREDs from bacteria and fungi showed better activities towards\nbulky aminesB and C (Fig. 2), compared to those from plants and\nhumans. Based on the initial results, the IREDs (IR-G02, 21, and\n35) were further evaluated for the synthesis of APIs against bulky\ncarbonyls and amines.\nEvaluating enzymatic synthesis of APIs using IREDs\nReactions of 4-phenyl-2-butanone with bulky amines. 4-phenyl-2-\nbutanamines are often found in APIs, such as the antihyperten-\nsion agent dilevalol\n21 in Fig. 3a. IR-G02 exhibited high speciﬁc\nactivity for4 with dopamineD (53% conversion), which harbors\na hydroxyl group that reduces the compatibility of substrates with\nIREDs, while the activities of IR-G21 and IR-G35 were sig-\nniﬁcantly lower with the conversions below 5%. Bulkier aminesB\nand E were also accepted as reacting partners with 4, with\nmoderate to high conversions.\nReactions of tetralone with bulky amines . Tetralone-derived\namines are frequently found in APIs, such rotigotine (Fig. 3b\nand Supplementary Figs. 3 and 4), an agent for the treatment of\nParkinson’s disease and restless syndrome22. Turner and cow-\norkers have studied synthesis of rotigotine by IREDs-catalyzed\nreductive aminations, using 5-methoxy-2-tetralone as ketone\ndonor and n-propylamine or thiophene-2-ethylamine as amine\ndonor with stereoselectivities up to 92% ( S) and 99% ( S)\nFig. 2 Screening for IREDs using the increasing-molecule-volume-screening approach.The number of enzyme hits is shown above the structure of the\ncorresponding secondary amine. The black color scale in each tile is representative of the number of hits generated through the screening with the given\nsubstrate. The standard assay mixture (50μL) contained 5.0 mM ketone, 5.0 mM amine, 1.0 mM NADP+, GDH (0.2 mg ml−1), D-glucose (30 mM),\n100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), and 1 mg mL−1 IREDs. The conversion of reductive amination products was determined by comparison with\nUV-Vis absorptions of synthesized standard reference materials. The enzymes (IR-G02, 21, and 35) with red triangle block are potent IREDs.\nCOMMUNICATIONS CHEMISTRY | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42004-022-00743-y ARTICLE\nCOMMUNICATIONS CHEMISTRY|           (2022) 5:123 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42004-022-00743-y | www.nature.com/commschem 3\nrespectively. In this study, the speciﬁc activities of IR-G02, 21,\nand 35 were measured towards3 with B, and low to moderate\nconversions (6–22%) were obtained.

Given aromatic conjugated ketones being\nchallenged substrates for IREDs20,24, we applied kinetic resolution to\nsynthesize bulkyN-alkylated benzylamines. 3-phenylpropionaldehyde\n5 and racemic 1-(1-Naphthyl)ethylamineF were used for reductive\namination, and >44% conversions were observed for IR-G02 and IR-\nG35 with excellent kinetic resolution >99% (S) and >83% (S),\nrespectively.\nReactions with bulky tryptamine and 5-methoxytryptamine .\nTryptamine C and 5-methoxytryptamineG are building blocks for\nclinically important 5-HT agonists and therapeutics25,s u c ha st h e\npsychedelic drug 5-MeO-MPMI (Fig.3d).

We used the\nadamantine derivatives to probe the preference of IR-G02, 21,\nand 35 towards polycyclic structures. 2-adamantanone 2 and\nmemantine H have not been reported to be accepted by IREDs,\nwhich could be used to synthesize agents for viral infections and\nAlzheimer’s disease, such as bromantane 26 in Fig. 3e. The\nsynthesis of 2C , 2D, and 6H using IR-G02 gave conversions of\n54%, 41%, and >99%, respectively. IR-G35 also showed high\nconversion (79%) for the reductive amination of2 and D. Both2\nand H could be well transformed, which represents an important\nextension of the substrate scope of IREDs.\nReactions with 3,3-diphenylpropylamine. We were further inter-\nested in the reductive aminations towards more challenging\nsubstrates, for instance, 3,3-diphenylpropylamineI. IR-G02 gave\n61 and 15% conversions for the reductive aminations ofL with\ntwo chain aldehydes (8 and 9), while IR-G35 showed 56 and 28%\nconversions for those two reductive aminations (Fig.3f).\nOverall, moderate (20–60%) or high conversions (>60%) were\nobserved for most reactions in Fig.3, and all bulky amines ofB-I\ncould be well transformed. IR-G02 showed unusually broad\nsubstrate tolerance with >50% conversions for 11 products in\nFig. 3. Thus, we further expanded the test scope for IR-G02 with a\nvariety of ﬁrst-time-tested substrates (Supplementary Figs. 6 and\n7). Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Tables 2 and 3\ndisplays all reactions performed with an equimolar ratio of\ncarbonyls and amines, using the mass-ion abundance of the\ncorresponded products (determined by LC-MS), which indicates\ni) 14 ﬁrst-time-tested bulky amines (B–O) could be efﬁciently\ntransformed with certain carbonyl donors; ii) over 135 reductive-\namination products could be synthesized with considerable\nconversions (each of their ion abundances is more than\n5×1 0\n6); iii) aliphatic aldehydes, such as 5, 6, 9, and 18, are\namong the most active carbonyl donors. Overall, this work\nsigniﬁcantly expanded the substrate scope of IREDs.\nStructural studies of IR-G02. To investigate the structural basis\nfor observed prominent activities of IR-G02, the apo-structure\n(PDB ID: 7XE8) and NADP+ complex of IR-G02 (PDB ID:\n7XR5) were obtained (Figs.4a and5a). However, several attempts\nto crystallize the ternary complex with NADP+ and (1-methyl-3,\n4-dihydroisoquinoline 24), 5,o r F were unsuccessful. This is\nconsistent with the isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) results\nshowing no signiﬁcant reaction heat or saturation curve detected\nfor interactions between IR-G02 and the substrates above (Sup-\nplementary Fig. 9). The apo- structure of IR-G02 shared the\nsimilar dimeric structure ofAspRedAm7. It is a dimer with the\nactive site forms at the interface (Fig.4a). Each of the monomers\nwas made up of anN-terminal Rossman domain and aC-term-\ninal helical bundle connected by a long inter-domain α-helix.\nExcept for the NADPH binding site, the pocket cavity of IR-G02\nshowed a strong negative electrostatic surface potential (Fig.5a),\nwhich may favor the entry of positively charged amine donors\nand imine intermediate27, and contribute to its high substrate\npromiscuity.\nPrevious reports described three IREDs thatAoIRED, BcIRED\nand AspRedAm switching to a closed conformation upon cofactor\nbinding, characterized by a relative angle-closure between theN-\nterminal Rossmann and the C-terminal helical domain 7,28,29,\nwhile such movements were not found in IR-G02-NADP +\ncomplex. Superimposition of apo-IR-G02 and IR-G02-NADP+\ncomplex shows an overall rmsd of 2.665 Å. There are substantial\nchanges in the Rossman fold: most secondary structures shift with\nthe binding of NADP+, and the side chain of T102ﬂips with its\nhydroxy group facing the NADP+ and forming a hydrogen bond\nwith the ribose moiety of NADP+. The homologous site of the\nresidue S260 in IR-G36 is occupied by A242 in IR-G02 and no\ninteraction is found between the loop 234–244 and NADP+,\nindicating IR-G02 is “wide” type IRED which possesses relative\nwide catalytic cavity for bulky-substrate entry and product\nrelease19.\nIR-G02 showed a 37% sequence identity with AspRedAm.\nCavity-volume calculation using CASTp30 suggested the cavity\nvolume of IR-G02-NADP+ (Supplementary Method 3) complex\nis 1.9-fold of that ofAspRedAm (Supplementary Fig. 10), which\nalso rationalizes its better substrate tolerance31–38. This is also\nconsistent with our hypothesis that IREDs obtained through the\nincreasing-target-volume screening may possess large substrate-\nbinding pockets.\nSite-directed mutagenesis of IR-G02. In order to investigate the\nkey residues in the active site, and the residues associated with the\nbulky substrate tolerance, site-directed mutagenesis was per-\nformed with 14 selected residues in the active site (Fig.4a). Three\nresidues Y177, D169, and N93 have been proposed as the catalytic\ntriad inAspRedAm39. The homologous site of W187 was Y177 in\nAspRedAm, which was proposed to be essential for protonation\nand anchoring of the carbonyls39. The weak protic W187 is\nincapable of being a proton shuttle, and a nearby protonic resi-\ndue, most likely H247 could take the place of W187. Analysis of\nthe IR-G02-NADP\n+ complex suggested the side chain of H247 is\npositioned approximately 11.9 Å from the NADPH C4 atom that\ndelivers and accepts hydride (Fig.4b and Supplementary Table 4),\nwhereas the distance from W187 to NADPH C4 atom is 12.8 Å.\nThe increased Km values of mutants W187A and H247A for\nketone 1 support the possible roles of two residues in ketone\nbinding (Fig. 4c). Meanwhile, mutants W187A and H247A\nshowed signiﬁcant decreases in conversions for all reductive\naminations (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 4).\nThe residue D179, which occupies the position equivalent to\nD169 in AspRedAm, is proposed to be responsible for\ndeprotonating the amine substrate39. The mutant D179A shows\nno apparent change in the imine reduction activity but a\nsigniﬁcant decrease in all reductive amination conversions\n(13–75%) and higher Km values for ketone 1, suggestive of a\nsigniﬁcant role in reductive amination.\nThe homologue of T102 has been reported to be the amine\ndonor binding and cofactor sites39,40. Notably, the mutant T102A\nshowed signiﬁcantly decreased conversions toward all substrates\n(Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 4). Protein structure analysis\nsuggested that T102 was located at the Rossmann fold domain\nwith its side chain approximately 2.8–3.0 Å from the 2′ and 3′-\nribose hydroxyls of NADPH, which is responsible for recognizing\nand binding NADPH (Fig.5b). Indeed, ITC results suggested that\nT102A showed a 43% decrease in the afﬁnity to NADPH (Kd\nvalues: 2.69E4 M −1 (Wild Type); 1.88E5 M −1 (T102A);\nSupplementary Fig. 11).\nInterestingly, 10 and 92% improvements were observed for\nD240A toward the synthesis of 2C and 3C (Fig. 4b and\nSupplementary Table 4), respectively. Tunnel analysis using\nCaver41 suggested D241 is located at theﬂexible loop A234-L244\non the top of the active site, which forms a bottleneck (about\n3.6 Å) imposing steric constraints for the entrance of the bulky\nsubstrates (Fig. 5c and Supplementary Fig. 12). The structure of\nmutant D241A has been modeled, and indeed, the bottleneck was\nCOMMUNICATIONS CHEMISTRY | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42004-022-00743-y ARTICLE\nCOMMUNICATIONS CHEMISTRY|           (2022) 5:123 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42004-022-00743-y | www.nature.com/commschem 5\nFig. 4 Structural and mutagenesis data of IR-G02. aApo- structure of IR-G02 (PDB: 7XE8, Supplementary Data 1) and the residues inside the active\npocket at the interface.b Analysis of the conversions of the imine reductions and reductive aminations with wild-type and mutants of IR-G02.c Kinetic data\nof IR-G02 wild-type and mutants W187A, H247A, and M217A for ketone1.

Mutant M217A\ndisplayed high activities for the imine reduction of 24 or the\nsynthesis of 1A and 1B, but almost lost the activities for the\nsynthesis of bulky 1C , 2C , and 3C with 93–96% decreases of\nconversions (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 4), suggesting a\nrole of M217 in bulky substrates tolerance. The mutations of\nthree hydrophobic residues L183, M186, and L190 on the longα-\nhelix to alanine showed different reductions of activities towards\nsubstrates (Fig. 4b and Supplementary Table 4). Especially, the\nactivities of mutant L183A showed considerable decreases for all\nreactions, suggesting that the residue L183 located on the inter-\ndomain α-helix may provide the necessary hydrophobic force or\nsteric hindrance to ensure the catalytic conformation of the\nsubstrate in the active pocket. Ala scanning mutagenesis on the\nrest of the residues in the active site gave no obvious differences\nin all activities.\nOverall, our work revealed a similar reductive-amination\nmechanism of IR-G02 toAspRedAm, and the intensely negative\npotential of the substrate-binding site and relative wide catalytic\ncavity may contribute to the good bulky amine compatibility in\nIR-G02.\nPreparative-scale synthesis of N-alkylated benzylamine via\nkinetic resolution. To demonstrate the practical utility of IR-\nG02, we set up to preparative scale synthesis of N-alkylated\nbenzylamine (S)-5F, which is an analogue of sensipar. The pH\noptimum of IR-G02 was found to be 7.0, and the temperature\noptimum was 30 °C (Supplementary Table 5). The unfolding\nnature was studied by recording CD222 at different temperatures\n(20–80 °C), which indicated the melting temperature of IR-G 02\nwas found to be 52 °C with 8 degrees higher than that of\nAspRedAm (Supplementary Fig. 13) 10. The concentration of\nketone, the number of amine equivalents, and the enzyme loading\nwere also comprehensively studied. Kinetic parameters were\ndetermined with aKm value of 6.464 mM,Kcat value of 0.606 s−1,\nand Kcat/Km value of 0.094 s−1 mM−1. Good conversion (>48%)\ncould be achieved using an equimolar ratio of 20 mM5 and\nracemic F with 0.15 mg mL−1 IR-G02. Therefore, a preparative\nscale reaction (250 mL reaction volume) was performed using5\n(670.85 mg, 5 mmol) and equal amineF (856.20 mg, 5 mmol)\n(Supplementary Method 4 and Fig. 14), which were converted\ninto (S)-5F with high enantioselectivity (>99% ee) and 48%\nconversion. Eventually, (S)-5F was produced in 39% isolated\nyield, with total turnover numbers (TTNs) up to 2087, and space\ntime yield (STY) up to 18.10 g L−1 d−1.\nConclusion\nIn addition to the wider tunnel and negative potential of the\nenzyme cavity highlighted here, the characteristics of the sub-\nstrates include polarity, thepKa of the amine donors, and steric\nhindrance around the reacting amine or carbonyl groups, etc.,\nwhich could also affect the activities of IREDs. Thus, various\nIREDs with dedicated substrate preferences and complementary\nenantioselectivities towards diverse amine donors are desired, but\nnot yet reported. The ones presented here represent an ideal\nstarting point to further broaden the chemist’s biocatalyst toolbox\nfor chiral amine synthesis. Also, IR-G02, 21, and 35 have been\nevaluated for the synthesis of various APIs. For example, IR-G35\nshowed moderate enantioselectivity (>77%) in the synthesis of a\nrotigotine substructure. Future protein engineering will be the\nmethod of choice to generate more efﬁcient and stereospeciﬁc\nmutants of IR-G02, 21, and 35.\nThe IREDs identi ﬁed here by the Increasing-Molecule-\nVolume-Screening showed good tolerance of 14ﬁrst-time-tested\nbulky amines. IR-G02 exhibits an excellent substrate scope that\nenables it to synthesize more than 135 secondary and tertiary\namines with considerable conversions. Finally, a gram-scale and\nhighly-enantioselective synthesis (>99%) of sensipar analogue (S)-\n5F was achieved with IR-G02 through the kinetic resolution\napproach, by using only a stoichiometric amount of bulky amine\n1-(1-Naphthyl)ethylamine.\nIn summary, the broad tolerance to bulky amines of IREDs\nwith low stoichiometry provides a biological route to access\nmedicinal chiral amines. Our work will stimulate further research,\nas many questions are still open, including how to further engi-\nneer IR-G02, 21, and 35 for favoring polar and hindered sub-\nstrates. Due to the hydrophobic nature of the active site in\nIREDs7,18, characterized IREDs tend to accept small and hydro-\nphobic substrates7,18. Thus, one challenge regarding the industrial\napplication of IREDs is the low preference toward polar sub-\nstrates, including carboxylic-acid or hydroxyl-substituted ones.\nIR-G02 shows activities towardsD, O, M, and22, which are only\ncases for the enzyme-catalyzed reductive aminations towards\nsubstrates harboring hydroxyl groups to the best of our knowl-\nedge. Hence, more efforts for identifying and engineering IREDs\nwith substrate preference toward bulky substrates remains to\nbe done.\nMethods\nGeneral. LC-MS analysis was performed on the AGILENT-1100HPLC/G1946D\nMSD (Agilent Technologies Inc., California, USA) system using C18 analytical\ncolumn (Ultimate XB-C18, 2.1 × 100 mm, 3μm). Chiral HPLC analysis was per-\nformed on Shimadzu LC-2030C 3D plus (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) or Waters 2695\n(Waters, Milford, USA) using chiral analytical columns (CHIRALPAK IA/OD-H/\nAY-H, 4.6 × 250 mm, 5μm). 1D and 2D NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker\nAvance 500 MHz spectrometer. Size-exclusion chromatography was carried out\nwith Sephadex LH-20 column (GE Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA). Column chro-\nmatography was performed on silica gel (200–300 mesh, Qingdao Marine Ltd.,\nQingdao, China). Commercially available chemicals and reagents were purchased\nfrom Meryer (Shanghai, China), Macklin (Shanghai, China), 3AChem (Shanghai,\nChina), Sigma-Aldrich (Poole, Dorset, UK), or Alfa Aesar (Karlsruhe, Germany)\nunless stated otherwise. HPLC solvents were obtained from Thermo Fisher Sci-\nentiﬁc (Waltham, Massachusetts, USA).\nReductive amination procedure for the preparation of amines. A dry methanol\n(10 mL) solution of the ketone or aldehyde (2.0 mmol), the corresponding amine\n(3.0 mmol), and acetic acid (300μL) under an N\n2 atm was stirred for 1.5 h at r.t.\nThe reaction was placed in an ice-H2O bath and sodium cyanoborohydride\n(0.377 g, 6.0 mmol) was added. The reaction mixture gradually warmed to r.t. and\nstirred overnight. The reaction progress was monitored by TLC and following\ncompletion was quenched with sat. NaHCO3 solution (10 mL) and stirred for an\nadditional 30 min. The mixture was extracted with EtOAc (3 × 10 mL) and the\ncombined organic phase dried over Na2SO4 and concentrated under reduced\npressure. Column chromatography on silica affords the corresponding racemic\namine. The NMR data are provided in Supplementary Note 1 and Supplementary\nData 4.\nExpression and puriﬁcation of IREDs. The plasmids containing the genes for target\nenzymes were used to transformE. coliBL21(DE3) competent cells for gene\nexpression. Pre-cultures were grown in LB-medium (10 mL) containing 30 µg mL−1\nkanamycin for 12 h at 37 °C with shaking at 220 r.p.m. 1 L volume cultures were\ninoculated with the pre-culture (10 mL) and incubated at 37 °C, with shaking at\n220 r.p.m. until an OD600 of 0.6~0.8 was reached. Gene expression was induced by the\naddition of IPTG (0.2 mM) and shaking was continued overnight at 16 °C with\nshaking at 160 r.p.m. The cells were then harvested by centrifugation at 5000 g for\n30 min and resuspended in 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.5, containing 300 mM NaCl.\nCells were disrupted by ultrasonication for 10 min, 5 s on, 9 s off cycles, and the\nsuspension was centrifuged at 50,000 g for 30 min to yield a clear lysate.\nThe N-terminal His-tagged proteins were puriﬁed using the Ni-NTA column.\nIn each case, the lysate was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated Ni-NTA column,\nfollowed by washing with a load buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl, 40 mM\nCOMMUNICATIONS CHEMISTRY | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42004-022-00743-y ARTICLE\nCOMMUNICATIONS CHEMISTRY|           (2022) 5:123 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42004-022-00743-y | www.nature.com/commschem 7\nimidazole pH 7.5). The bound protein was eluted with buffer containing 250 mM\nimidazole. Proteins were concentrated and used for biotransformation reactions.\nProtein puriﬁcation and crystallisation. The amino acid and DNA sequences are\navailable in Supplementary Note 2. The N-terminal His6-tagged proteins were\npuriﬁed using Ni-NTA column, followed by size exclusion chromatography (SEC)\n(Supplementary Fig. 15). In each case, the lysate was loaded onto a pre-equilibrated\nNi-NTA column, followed by washing with a load buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl,\n300 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole pH 7.5). The bound protein was eluted using a\nlinear gradient with buffer containing 60~250 mM imidazole. IR-G02 fractions\nwere pooled, concentrated, and loaded onto a GL 10/300 Superdex 200 gelﬁltration\ncolumn pre-equilibrated with 50 mM Tris-HCl, 300 mM NaCl pH 7.5 buffer. The\nconcentrated protein sample after gelﬁltration was used for crystallization\nscreening.\nIR-G02 was crystallized by the sitting-drop vapour diffusion method at 18 °C\nwith 1μL protein solution mixed with 1μL reservoir buffer. High-quality crystals\n(Supplementary Fig. 15) of IR-G02 grew in the buffer containing 0.2 M ammonium\nacetate, 0.1 M Bis-Tris 5.5, 25 % w/v PEG 3350 with a protein concentration of\n20 mg ml\n−1.\nIR-G02-NADP+ complex was also crystallized by the sitting-drop vapour\ndiffusion method at 18 °C with 1μL protein solution mixed with 1μL reservoir\nbuffer. High-quality crystals (Supplementary Fig. 15) of IR-G02-NADP+ complex\ngrew in the buffer containing 0.1 M Bis-Tris pH 7.5, 25% PEG 4000 and 0.25 M\nNaCl with a protein concentration of 20 mg ml−1 which was incubation with\nNADP+ (10 eq) for 2 h.\nDiffraction data were collected with cryoprotected (in a reservoir solution\ncontaining 20% [v/v] glycerol) crystals at the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation\nFacility beamline BL17U. All the datasets were processed with XDS and aimless.\nThe structure of IR-G02 was determined by the molecular replacement method in\nPhenix. The atomic model was completed with Coot and reﬁned with Phenix.reﬁne\nin Phenix, and the stereochemical quality of theﬁnal model was assessed with\nMolprobity. Data collection, processing and reﬁnement statistics are summarized\nin Supplementary Table 6.\nMichaelis-Menten kinetic analysis. The kinetics measurements of puriﬁed wild\ntype and variants of IR-G02 for substrates were performed at 30 °C in potassium\nphosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.0) at various concentration ranges of ketones\n(0.1–50 mM). Kinetic constants were determined through non-linear regression\nbased on Michaelis-Menten kinetics using GraphPad Prism7 software.\nIsothermal titration calorimetry. ITC experiments were performed in a Microcal\nITC200 microcalorimeter at 25 °C in 100 mM PBS buffer (pH 7.4). Wild type,\nvariant T102A of IR-G02 and the ligands (NADPH, NADP\n+, 1-(1-naphthyl)\nethylamine, 3-phenylpropionaldehyde, and 1-methyl-3, 4-dihydroisoquinoline)\nwere dialyzed into the PBS buffer containing 2% DMSO. All experiments were\nperformed with proteins (wild type or variant T102A of IR-G02) in the micro-\ncalorimeter cell at 40μM concentration, and ligands in the syringe at 600μM\nconcentration. The titrations (total 40 min) consisted of a total of 20 injections,\nspaced 120 s apart. Data were analyzed in ORIGIN using a one-site binding model\nwith ﬁxed n = 1 per B subunit (theﬁxed-parameter was required to achieve con-\nvergence of theﬁt).\nThermal denaturation studies. CD thermal unfolding measurements were per-\nformed using a Jasco J810 CD Spectrophotometerﬁtted with a computer-controlled\nPeltier temperature control unit, using protein solutions at 0.25 mg mL\n−1 in 100 mM\nNaPi pH 7.0 containing 1 mM NADPH cofactor. The protein solution was heated\nthrough a 5 °C ramp with a 5 min relaxation time between the recording of CD\nspectra at different temperatures from 20 to 80 °C. The unfolding curves were built by\nusing the CD signal at 220 nm to obtain melting temperature values.\nReporting summary.

Enzymatic RedAm\nreactions have typically used small hydrophobic amines, but many\ninteresting pharmaceutical targets require that larger amines be used in\nthese coupling reactions. Following the identification of IR77 from\nEnsifer adhaerens as a promising biocatalyst for the reductive amination\nof cyclohexanone with pyrrolidine, we have characterized the ability of\nthis enzyme to catalyze couplings with larger bicyclic amines such as\nisoindoline and octahydrocyclopenta(c)pyrrole. By comparing the\nactivity of IR77 with reductions using sodium cyanoborohydride in\nwater, it was shown that, while the coupling of cyclohexanone and\npyrrolidine involved at least some element of reductive amination, the amination with the larger amines likely occurred ex situ, with\nthe imine recruited from solution for enzyme reduction. The structure of IR77 was determined, and using this as a basis, structure-\nguided mutagenesis, coupled with point mutations selecting improving amino acid sites suggested by other groups, permitted the\nidentification of a mutant A208N with improved activity for amine product formation. Improvements in conversion were attributed\nto greater enzyme stability as revealed by X-ray crystallography and nano differential scanning fluorimetry. The mutant IR77-A208N\nwas applied to the preparative scale amination of cyclohexanone at 50 mM concentration, with 1.2 equiv of three larger amines, in\nisolated yields of up to 93%.\nKEYWORDS: biocatalysis, imine reductase, reductive aminase, chiral amine, NADPH\n■\nINTRODUCTION\nIn recent years, the emergence of imine reductases (IREDs)\nhas had a substantial impact on the application of enzymes in\nthe preparation of chiral amines of pharmaceutical interest.\n1−5\nIREDs are NAD(P)H-dependent oxidoreductases that catalyze\nthe asymmetric reduction of prochiral imines, but in certain\ncases also enable the reductive amination of prochiral ketones\nthrough catalysis of both imine formation and subsequent\nreduction of the iminium ion intermediate. In such cases where\nevidence has been provided of the enzyme catalyzing both\nchemical steps at near or equimolar ratios of ketone and amine\nsubstrates, this subset of IREDs have also been termed\n“reductive aminases” (RedAms) (Scheme 1).\n6−12\nThe fundamental nature of the reductive amination reaction\nto the formation of amines has ensured that IRED-based\ntechnology has now been applied in the pharmaceutical sector\nat up to kg\n13\nand ton\n14\nscale. Their ease of expression and\napplication, in a mode similar to well-studied keto-\nreductases,\n15\nhas also ensured that IREDs and RedAms have\nbeen successfully applied in cascades of up to three enzymes in\nthe synthesis of chiral amines.\n10,16\nIn the first descriptions of\nIREDs catalyzing reductive aminations at low amine\nequivalents,\n7\nthe amine moiety was in most cases small and\nhydrophobic, including, for example, methylamine, allylamine,\nand cyclopropylamine.

{"text": "amination” reactions could certainly be achieved using IREDs\nwith large excesses of amine to favor imine formation in\nsolution, true enzyme-catalyzed reductive aminations at\nketone: amine equivalents at or close to 1:1 could for the\nmost part only be achieved with this limited range of amine\npartners. As part of these initial reports, however, and in\npublications since, large screens of IREDs from a range of\norganism sources, including metagenomes,\n5\nhave revealed\nenzymes competent for catalyzing reductive amination\nreactions between selected ketones and larger amine partners,\nincluding aniline,\n17,18\nbenzylamine,\n17,18\nand longer aryl alkyl-\namines.\n12\nFor example, France and co-workers showed that\nIRED “IR77” catalyzed the amination of cyclohexanone 1 with\nbenzylamine a and pyrrolidine b, provided at 2.5 molar equiv\n(m.e.), to give the amine products 1a and 1b in up to 78 and\n97% conversion, respectively (Scheme 2).\n17\nMore recently,\nGao and co-workers showed that engineered mutants of IR-\nG36 enabled the amination of N-Boc-3-piperidinone 2 with 1.1\nequiv of amines such as 2-phenylethylamine c to give products\nsuch as 2c with 98% conversion and >99% e.e.\n12\nResearchers at GSK also showed that aldehyde 3 could be\ncoupled with amine d at 2.4 m.e. using the “M3” variant of\n“IR46” from Saccharothrix espanaensis to give the amine\nproduct 3d in 84.4% yield.\n13\nFollowing the earlier work of our\ngroups,\n17\nwe were interested to explore the limits of acceptance\nof bulky amines in the amination of cyclohexanone by “IR77”.\nIn addition to more standard amine partners such as ammonia\ng, methylamine e and allylamine d (Scheme 3), we were\nparticularly interested in the use of bulky secondary amines\nsuch as isoindoline h, and octahydrocyclopenta(c)pyrrole i, as\nwhen coupled with cyclohexanone 1, the products feature\nscaffolds encountered in pharmaceutical molecules such as the\nsulfonamide diuretic clorexolone 4 (Scheme 3).\nTo this end, in this study, we have investigated the ability of\nIR77 to enable the reductive amination of cyclohexanone with\nbulkier monocyclic and bicyclic imine substrates.

The structure of\nIR77 was determined, and rational mutagenesis was used to\ncreate mutants of improved activity. These have been\ncharacterized using kinetics, X-ray crystallography, and nano-\ndifferential scanning fluorimetry (nano-DSF), and alanine 208\nwas identified as a hotspot for improved activity, with mutants\nA208S and A208N displaying greater catalytic efficiency than\nthe wild-type enzyme.\n■\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nReductive Aminations Using Purified IR77. The\nenzyme designated IR77 by France and co-workers in a\nprevious work\n17\nhas 100% sequence identity (Figure S1) with\nNCBI accession sequence WP_053252429, annotated as an\n“NADP-binding domain” from the nitrogen-fixing bacterium\nEnsifer adhaerens, also known as a species of Sinorhizobium.\nIR77 had previously been shown to be a promising target for\nreductive amination reactions, giving 78 and 97% yields for the\ncoupling of cyclohexanone 1 with benzylamine a and\npyrrolidine b, respectively, when using cell-free extracts\ncontaining the expressed enzyme.\n17\nAs a first step in\ninvestigating the engineering of IR77, the gene was subcloned\ninto the pET-YSBLIC-3C vector,\n19\nequipping the protein with\nan N-terminal hexahistidine tag, and was then expressed in\nEscherichia coli and purified using nickel affinity chromatog-\nraphy followed by size exclusion (Figure S2). The purified\nenzyme was assayed for activity by gas chromatography\nanalysis in small-scale (3 mL) biotransformations containing\n10 mM cyclohexanone 1 with 25 mM amines benzylamine a,\npyrrolidine b, allylamine d, methylamine e, aniline f, or 2 M\nammonia g (Scheme 3 and Figure 1). In each case, the\nconversions were superior to those observed with the cell\nextracts performed previously,\n17\npresumably attributable to the\nhigher specific activity of the purified enzyme employed in\nthese reactions. After 6 h, near quantitative conversions to\nsecondary amine products were achieved for reactions with\nbenzylamine a and pyrrolidine b and methylamine e, although\npoor conversion (<10%) was observed with ammonia g, in\nagreement with previous observations.\n17\nKinetic analysis on wt-IR77 was performed using UV\nspectrophotometry to monitor the oxidation of NADPH at\nincreasing concentrations of cyclohexanone 1or pyrrolidine b\nin the presence of a constant concentration of the other\n(Tables 1, S3, S4 and Figure S5A,B).\nA k\ncat\nof 0.24 s\n−1\nfor cyclohexanone 1, measured in the\npresence of pyrrolidine b, was between those recorded for the\nfungal reductive aminases, for example, AspRedAm and\nAtRedAm, for which values of 1.47 and 0.11 s\n−1\nwere\npreviously recorded for the same substrate.\n7,8\nThe K\nm\nwas 15\nmM, significantly higher than values recorded for AspRedAm\nand AtRedAm of 1.9 and 2.1 mM, respectively.\n7,8\nFor\npyrrolidine b, the k\ncat\nand K\nm\nrecorded in the presence of 10\nmM cyclohexanone were 0.12 s\n−1\nand 17 mM. These values\nwere higher and lower, respectively, than those obtained for\nthis amine with AspRedAm (0.08 s\n−1\nand 25.1 mM), giving an\napproximately two-fold improved catalytic efficiency for IR77\nover that enzyme for this transformation.\n7\nIR77 was also assessed for its ability to catalyze the reductive\namination of 10 mM cyclohexanone 1 with 2.5 m.e. of target\namines isoindoline h, and octahydrocyclopenta(c)pyrrole i. In\nthese reactions (Figure 1), once again, we observed\nquantitative conversion to secondary amine products within\n2 and 8 h, respectively. Interestingly, kinetics experiments\nusing increasing concentrations of isoindoline h and 10 mM\ncyclohexanone revealed a higher k\ncat\nof 0.30 s\n−1\nand a lower K\nm\nof 0.61 mM for the bulkier amine (Figure S5C and Table S5),\ngiving a catalytic efficiency of 0.49 s\n−1\nmM\n−1\n, 66-fold higher\nthan for pyrrolidine.\nWe hypothesized that, rather than this being due to\nexceptional improvements in binding of h to the enzyme for\nreductive amination, it was reflective rather of a greater amount\nof intermediate imine that is formed in solution and recruited\nfor reduction by the enzyme directly. This would correspond\nto a switch in catalytic mode from a reductive aminase in\nwhich both imine formation and imine reduction are catalyzed\nby the enzyme, to an IRED, where the imine is formed in\nsolution and recruited for reduction by the enzyme’s active\nsite.\nTo examine this further, evidence for levels of imine\nformation in solution was sought by studying mixtures\ncontaining 1 and either b or h in the absence of enzyme by\n13\nC NMR (Figure 2).\nIn the mixture of cyclohexanone 1 with isoindoline h,\nsignificant broadening of the ketone carbonyl peak at\napproximately 220.5 ppm was observed with a width of\napproximately 40 Hz, much wider than all other peaks in\nspectrum with approximate values of 3 Hz (Figure 2). This\nsuggests that an intermediate is formed in solution during this\nreaction. However, the lack of peak broadening in the reaction\nof 1 with b, with a much narrower peak width of approximately\n4 Hz, suggests that no such intermediate is formed in that case.\nAlthough the intermediate suggested by analysis of the reaction\nbetween 1 and h cannot be characterized by variable\ntemperature experiments due to its short lifetime, its presence\nsuggests that a significant amount of cyclohexanone reacts to\nform an intermediate in solution in the absence of enzyme.\nWe had previously compared the reactions catalyzed by\nRedAms and IREDs with the reductive amination reaction of\nsodium cyanoborohydride when challenged with a mixture of\nketone and amine.\n8\nIn those experiments, we showed that both\nFigure 1.

A similar approach was employed here: we\nincubated NaBH\n3\nCN, with 1 and either a, b, f, or h, and\ncompared reactions rates with those incubated with wt-IR77\n(Figure 3).\nThe reaction of 1 with isoindoline h and NaBH\n3\nCN\ndisplayed similar rates and conversions to that observed with\nwt-IR77. The results suggest that the relevant imine is formed\nex situ and only the imine reduction is catalyzed by IR77.\nTable 1.

The results suggest that the mode of catalysis\nof IR77 is therefore dependent on the nature of the amine\npartner in the reductive amination reaction, including size and\nits nucleophilicity in water,\n20\nwhich may have a significant\ninfluence on the amount of imine formed in solution.\nStructure of IR77. As a first step to making mutants of\nIR77 with improved activity toward 1 with b and h, the\nstructure of the enzyme was determined by X-ray crystallog-\nraphy and refined to a resolution of 2.58 Å (PDB code 8A3X).\nData collection and refinement statistics can be found in Table\nS6. Crystals were obtained in the P2\n1\nspace group and featured\nfour molecules, representing two dimers, in the asymmetric\nunit. The enzyme adopts the canonical fold now well\nestablished for IRED structures.\n7,21−23\nAn N-terminal\nRossmann domain (residues 1−164) connects to a C-terminal\nhelical domain (195−294) through a long alpha-helix (165−\n194). Two monomers closely associate in a domain swapping\narrangement that serves to form two active sites per dimer,\neach at the interface of one N-terminal domain with the C-\nterminal domain of its partner (Figure 4A).\nA comparison of the monomer with structures in the PDB\nusing the DALI server\n24\nrevealed closest structural similarity\nwith the IREDs from Myxococcus stipitatus (6TOE; 51%\nsequence identity; rmsd 1.3 Å over 291 Cα atoms)\n25\nand\nStreptosporangum roseum (5OCM; 34%; 1.8 Å over 290).\n26\nFollowing building of the protein atoms and water molecules,\nclear electron density was observed within each active site that\ncould in each case be modeled as NADP\n+\n. When multiple\ndimers have been obtained within the asymmetric unit of\nIREDs, it has proved possible to discern different conforma-\ntions within the same structure, representative of “open” and\n“closed” dimers that hint at the structural flexibility of the\nIRED during catalysis.\n8\nIn IR77, each dimer can be considered\nto be a “closed” structure, with a hydrophobic pocket formed\nat the cofactor binding site. The substrate binding site is\ndefined by the frequently observed aspartate residue D171,\nwhich protrudes from the roof of the cavity into the active site\nfrom the interdomain helix (Figure 4B). Facing the\nnicotinamide ring of the cofactor, on the opposite side of the\nactive site, are the side chains of M178, W179, and H242 from\nthe partner monomer. At the back of the active site are V212\nand L216 from the partner monomer and T123. Two features\nof the active site which could explain the activity of the wild-\ntype IR77 with bulkier imines are the presence of T209 and\nP241 at the back and front of the binding site as viewed in\nFigure 4B, which replace much larger tryptophan and\nmethionine residues in IREDs that lack the ability to react\nwith bulkier substrates, such as AspRedAm,\n7\nand wild-type IR-\nG36.\n12\n(Figure S7). The product 2-cyclohexylisoindoline 1h\nwas modeled into the active site of IR77 using Autodock Vina\n(Figure 4B). Superimposition of the model with structures of\nAspRedAm clearly showed clashes with W210 and M239 in\nthat enzyme with the cyclohexyl and aromatic rings of the\nsubstrate.\nMutation of IR77. In an effort to identify mutational sites\nthat might improve the activity of IR77, the choice of first-\nround mutations was informed by previous successful\nengineering studies on IREDs that had improved activity. In\none notable example, researchers at GSK had successfully\nengineered the IRED “IR46” from S. espanaensis for the\nreductive amination of 3 with d (Scheme 2) using point site-\nsaturation mutagenesis and shown that some mutations, with\npossible generic implications, which were more remote from\nthe substrate binding site, were useful for improving the\nactivity of the IRED for that process.\n13\nThese included Y142S\n(IR77 A119), thought to introduce a hydrogen bond to the\npendant D194 (IR77 D171); L201F and V215I (IR77 M178\nand C192), each thought to introduce favorable hydrophobic\ninteractions at the dimer interface; L37Q and V92K (IR77\nFigure 4.

(A) Biotransformations of cyclohexanone 1 with pyrrolidine b using mutants of IR77; (B) biotransformations of cyclohexanone 1 with\noctahydrocyclopenta(c)pyrrole i using point mutants of IR77.\nACS Catalysis pubs.acs.org/acscatalysis Research Article\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.2c06066\nACS Catal. 2023, 13, 1669−1677\n1673\nR12Q and S67K), thought to be involved in cofactor binding\nor orientation and S258N, thought to have a role in interaction\nwith the substrate (IR77 S237). In addition, the previous paper\nalso identified mutation Q231F, which was thought to again\nintroduce favorable hydrophobic interactions at the dimer.\nSuperimposition of a structural model of IR46 suggested that\nIR77 has alanine A208 in this position. Hence, we also mutated\nA208 to serine to create hydrogen-bonding interactions in a\nhydrophilic pocket containing T133, N156, and Q158 in the\npartner monomer. Based upon this analysis, IR77 point\nmutants R12Q, S67K, A119S, M178F, C192I, S237N, and\nA208S, illustrated on the IR77 dimer shown in Figure 4A, were\nchosen as starting points for a rational mutagenesis\ninvestigation targeting an improved enzyme for the amination\nof 1 with b, h, and i.\nPoint mutants were prepared by InFusion- (Takara Bio)-\nbased mutagenesis starting with PCR using primers listed in\nTable S2. Mutations were confirmed by sequencing and IR77\nmuteins prepared and purified as for the wild-type (wt)\nenzyme. In the first instance, the performance of mutants in\nthe reductive amination of 10 mM cyclohexanone 1 with 25\nmM pyrrolidine b was assessed using GC analysis (Figure 5A).\nThese studies revealed that three of the mutants, A119S,\nC192I, and A208S, clearly catalyzed the reaction at a rate faster\nthan the wt, reaching superior conversions of 74, 83, and 79%\ncompared to the wt (69%) after 4 h. By contrast, active site\nmutant S237N was the slowest and resulted in the lowest\nconversion after the same time. M178F, S67K, and R12Q also\ndisplayed inferior activity to the wt. In an effort to characterize\nthe basis for the improved activity, A119S, C192I, and A208S\nwere subjected to kinetic analysis using cyclohexanone 1 as the\nsubstrate at an invariant concentration of pyrrolidine b (Table\n1). While the catalytic efficiency (k\ncat\n/K\nm\n) of the A119S and\nC92I mutants was the same or only marginally higher\ncompared to wt-IR77, that of A208S was 2.85-fold and 2.95-\nfold increased over the wt for cyclohexanone 1 and pyrrolidine\nFigure 6. (A) Biotransformations with A208 SSM library of IR77. (B) Biotransformations with best four mutants from SSM library at a higher\nsubstrate loading.\nACS Catalysis pubs.acs.org/acscatalysis Research Article\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.2c06066\nACS Catal. 2023, 13, 1669−1677\n1674\nb, respectively, attributable both to increases in k\ncat\nand to a\nreduction in K\nm\nin both cases.\nMutants were also assayed with respect to the reductive\namination of 10 mM cyclohexanone 1 with 25 mM target\namines isoindoline h, and octahydrocyclopenta(c)pyrrole i. For\namine i, A119S, C192I, and A208S single mutants out-\nperformed wt-IR77 with respect to conversion reaching higher\nconversions of 62, 69, and 64% within 6 h with\noctahydrocyclopenta(c)pyrrole i compared to 56% for wt-\nIR77 (Figure 5B). Isoindoline h proved to be an exceptional\namine partner with both the wt-IR77 and best mutants\nreaching product conversions of >99% within 2 h (Figure\nS6B). Indeed, at this concentration of h, it was not possible to\ndiscriminate between the activities of variants for this amine\nsubstrate.\nThe superior performance of the three point mutants\nidentified in the first round prompted us to create a further\nlibrary of double (A119S/A208S, A119S/C192I, and C192I/\nA208S) and triple (A119S/C192I/A208S) mutants that\ncombined the beneficial mutations. Interestingly, the combi-\nnation of mutations was, for most muteins, largely not additive;\nindeed, the catalytic performance of most in the reductive\namination of cyclohexanone 1 with pyrrolidine b was inferior\nto that of wt-IR77 or single-point mutants (Figure S6). The\ntriple mutant A119S/C192I/A208S was the poorest of the\ncombined mutants overall. However, in the case of A119S/\nA208S, conversion after 1 h was slightly improved from 36%\n(wt) to 41% (A119S) and 45% (A208S) to 52% (Figure S6D),\nalthough kinetic analysis showed that the catalytic efficiency of\nthis double mutant was inferior to that of wt-IR77, with a k\ncat\n/\nK\nm\nof 0.23 s\n−1\nmM\n−1\n.\nGiven the lack of improved activity in the combined\nmutants, the site of mutation with the best catalytic efficiency,\nA208S, was further examined using a site saturation muta-\ngenesis (SSM) library. Preliminary 30 min reactions with 1 and\nb or h with all 19 point mutants filtered out those with the\nlowest conversions, highlighting seven with conversions greater\nthan the wt-IR77 for further testing: A208N, A208D A208C,\nA208H, A208F, A208K, and A208Y (Figure 6A). Reactions\nwith 80 mM 1 and 1.2 m.e. h permitted the identification of\nfour mutants (A208N, A208H, A208K, and A208F) with\nsuperior conversion over 24 h compared to A208S. In order to\ndiscriminate the performance of these mutants, substrate\nloadings were increased to 150 mM cyclohexanone and 1.2\nm.e. isoindoline. Although conversions plateaued after around\n4 h due to the high substrate loadings, the best performance\nwas observed with A208N, reaching 30% conversion compared\nto 22, 15, and 16% for A208H, A208K, and A208F,\nrespectively (Figure 6B).\nThe catalytic efficiency of A208N was evaluated with kinetic\nmeasurements (Table 1 and Figure S5). A k\ncat\nof 0.50 s\n−1\nfor\ncyclohexanone 1, measured in the presence of pyrrolidine b,\nwas greater than that recorded for wt-IR77 (0.25 s\n−1\n) and\nA208S (0.44 s\n−1\n) (Figure S5A). However, the K\nm\nof 26 mM\nwas greater than those recorded for wt-IR77 (16 mM) and\nA208S (9.6 mM), leading to a catalytic efficiency only 1.24 fold\ngreater than the wild type and approximately half that of\nA208S. For isoindoline h, the k\ncat\nrecorded in the presence of\n10 mM cyclohexanone was 0.28 s\n−1\n, in between those recorded\nfor wt-IR77 and A208S of 0.30 and 0.23 s\n−1\n, respectively\n(Figure S5C). However, the K\nm\nof 0.94 mM was greater than\nthose recorded for wt-IR77 and A208S of 0.61 and 0.60 mM,\ngiving 60% of the catalytic efficiency of wt-IR77 in this case.\nThe lower catalytic efficiency of A208N over A208S is\ncompensated for by the greater stability observed by the\nformer. An increase in melting temperature (T\nm\n), measured\nusing nano-DSF, of 8.2 °C was observed upon binding of\ncofactor, over 2 °C greater than the difference observed with\nwt-IR77 and 1 °C greater than A208S (Figure S8). This\nimprovement in stability is illustrated in the capability of IR77\nA208N to withstand significantly greater substrate loadings\nthan either wt-IR77 or A208S.\nStructure of IR77 A208N. To shed light on molecular\ninteractions that may affect the activity and stability of the\nA208N mutant, its structures were also determined using X-ray\ncrystallography (PDB code 8A5Z). Crystals of IR77 A208N\nwere obtained in the P2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\nspace group with two molecules\nin the asymmetric unit constituting one dimer. The dimer\nFigure 7.

Distances are given in Ångstroms.\nACS Catalysis pubs.acs.org/acscatalysis Research Article\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.2c06066\nACS Catal. 2023, 13, 1669−1677\n1675\nfeatured one more open active site and the other more closed,\nand more resembling the conformation observed with those in\nthe wild-type structure. Following building and refinement of\nthe structure, electron density for the cofactor NADP\n+\nwas\nagain clearly visible within the active sites at each dimer\ninterface. Position A208N is observed at the interface of the C-\nterminal helical domain of one monomer and the N-terminal\ndomain of its partner. Introduction of the mutation has\nresulted in new H-bonding interactions between the N208 side\nchain and those of T133 and N156 in the partner monomer\n(Figure 7). Interestingly, Asn is also found in this position in\nthe IRED from Actinoalloteichus hymeniacidonis reported by\nGao and co-workers (PDB 7WNN),\n12\nalthough in that\ninstance, there are no H-bonding side chains on the partner\nmonomer to form stabilizing interactions. However, the benefit\nof engineering intersubunit interactions in IREDs for improved\nstability and activity previously described\n12,13\nis consolidated\nby the structural data on IR77-A208N in conjunction with the\nbiotransformation experiments.\nPreparative Reductive Aminations by IR77-A208N.\nTo assess the applicability of these reactions with the best\nmutein, IR77 A208N, preparative scale reactions were\nperformed on approximately 100 mg scale in 20 mL buffer\nwith substrate loadings of 50 mM cyclohexanone and 1.2 m.e.\nof benzylamine a, pyrrolidine b, and isoindoline h. Substrate\nloadings were selected to maintain a balance between high\nloadings and high product formation. Products were isolated\nwith good yields of 71, 62, and 93%, respectively, after flash\ncolumn purification, highlighting the potential synthetic\ncapability of IR77 A208N at higher concentrations of substrate.\n■\nCONCLUSION\nIn summary, we report the application of a wild-type IRED for\nthe reductive amination of ketones with bulky amines. IR77 is\nan enzyme capable of tolerating high substrate loadings of up\nto 150 mM and low ketone: amine equivalents of 1:1.2 with\ncyclohexanone and isoindoline. We have provided further\nevidence that bulky amines can be used as amine donors in\nreductive amination reactions to give products with high yields,\nbut that some larger amines, with greater nucleophilicity in\nwater, may be processed in a different catalytic mode to that of\nsmaller amines, with ex situ imine formation and subsequent\nenzyme-catalyzed reduction predominating in these cases. We\nhave also shown that mutations that target improved IRED\nperformance through the formation of new intermolecular\ninteractions can lead to mutants of superior process stability,\nan approach that may be transferred to other IRED\nengineering studies in the future.\n■\nEXPERIMENTAL SECTION\nFor full details of experimental procedures, see Supporting\nInformation.\n■\nASSOCIATED CONTENT\n*\nsı\nSupporting Information\nThe Supporting Information is available free of charge at\nhttps://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acscatal.2c06066.\nCloning and expression of IR77 genes and protein\npurification, mutagenesis of IR77, determination of\nkinetic constants, biotransformations, preparative-scale\nbiotransformations, GC analysis, time courses of\nbiotransformations analysed using GC, synthesis of\nstandards and characterisation of reaction products,\nsyntheses of amine standards, NMR analysis of imine\nformation in solution, structural alignment with\nAspRedAm, autodock models, and nano DSF measure-\nments (PDF)\n■\nAUTHOR INFORMATION\nCorresponding Author\nGideon Grogan − Department of Chemistry, University of\nYork, York YO10 5DD, U.K.;\n orcid.org/0000-0003-\n1383-7056; Email: gideon.grogan@york.ac.uk\nAuthors\nAmelia K.

Their applications include\nthe reduction of cyclic imines and the reductive amination of\nprochiral ketones. In this study, twenty-nine novel IREDs were\nrevealed through genome mining. Imine reductase activities\nwere screened at pH 7 and 9 and in presence of either NADPH\nor NADH; some IREDs showed good activities at both pHs and\nwere able to accept both cofactors. IREDs with Asn and Glu at\nthe key 187 residue showed preference for NADH. IREDs were\nalso screened against a series of dihydroisoquinolines to\nsynthesise tetrahydroisoquinolines (THIQs), bioactive alkaloids\nwith a wide range of therapeutic properties. Selected IREDs\nshowed high stereoselectivity, as well high THIQ yields (> 90 %)\nwhen coupled to a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase for\nNADPH cofactor recycling.\nIntroduction\nChiral amines play an important role in the synthesis of\nbioactive compounds for the fine chemical, pharmaceutical and\nagrochemical industries and it is estimated that around 40 % of\npharmaceutical drugs contain a chiral amine component in\ntheir structure.\n[1]\nDue to the high stereoselectivities that can be\nachieved, several sustainable biocatalytic routes are currently\nused in industrial processes for chiral amine synthesis involving\nbiocatalysts such as lipases,\n[2]\ntransaminases,\n[3]\nammonia\nlyases,\n[4]\namine dehydrogenases\n[5]\nand amine oxidases.\n[6]\nImine\nreductases (IREDs) are a relatively new group of enzymes that\nwere first reported in 2010 for reduction of the imine 2-methyl-\n1-pyrroline into (R) or (S)-2-methylpyrrolidine.\n[7]\nIREDs belong to\nthe NADPH-dependent oxidoreductase enzyme class and have\na preference for the reduction of cyclic imines into chiral amines\n(Scheme 1a).\n[8,9]\nThey are less efficient at achieving the inter-\nmolecular reductive amination of prochiral ketones with amines\nbut recently a subclass of IREDs, reductive aminases (RedAms),\nhave been reported to convert these via imines into the\nrespective amines (Scheme 1b).\n[10]\nIn addition, it has also been\nreported that IREDs can catalyse the kinetic resolution of chiral\nsecondary amines in the presence of NADP\n+\nat high pH\nvalues.\n[11]\nFor these reasons, IREDs are considered promising\nand powerful biocatalysts for the synthesis of a broad range of\nchiral primary, secondary and tertiary amine products; and a\nvaluable alternative to other biocatalysts currently used for this\npurpose.\nTraditional synthetic routes to access the same products\nafforded by IRED-catalysed reactions can be challenging to\nachieve in high stereoselectivities, and reduction of the\ncarbonyl group can lead to side products. The use of\nbiocatalysis therefore offers an exciting opportunity for industri-\nal-scale chiral amine syntheses. However, some drawbacks for\nthe wider application of IREDs remain such as poor activity, low\nstability, and narrow substrate specificity (especially (R)-selective\nIREDs).\n[12,13]\nRecently, significant effort has been made to\ndiscover new IREDs from plants, bacteria and fungi,\n[14–17]\nas well\nas from metagenomes,\n[18–20]\ntogether with studies to better\n[a] Dr. M.

In addition, IRED\nactivity on DHIQs towards THIQs synthesis was examined, and\nto increase THIQ reaction yields, selected IREDs were coupled\nwith a glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PDH) for cofac-\ntor recycling.\nResults and Discussion\nUncovering novel IREDs\nIREDs were mined from nine different microorganisms mainly\nfrom the Streptomyces genus. IREDs are mainly found in these\nstrains, which is associated with their ability to produce various\nsecondary metabolites such as antibiotics, peptides, pigments\nand bioherbicides, that contain amine functional groups.\n[32]\nProtein sequences of putative (S)- and (R)-IREDs were retrieved\nfrom BLASTp using the sequence of an IRED from S.\nkanamyceticus as a model protein (Uniprot Q1EQE0)\n[33]\nagainst\nthe whole genome of the specific microorganism.\nSequences were then confirmed by identifying two IRED-\nspecific motifs: first, the NADPH-cofactor binding motif\nGLGxMGx5[ATS]x4Gx4[VIL]WNR[TS]x2[KR]; and second, the ac-\ntive site motif Gx[DE]x[GDA]x[APS]x3{K}x[ASL]x[LMVIAG]. Se-\nquences with N191 were excluded as being one of the major\ndeterminants that differentiate IREDs from β-hydroxyacid\ndehydrogenases.\n[34]\nTwenty-nine IREDs were uncovered follow-\ning this in silico strategy, then cloned via our one-pot\nrestriction-ligation reaction method\n[35]\nusing E. coli BL21(DE3) or\nE. coli Rosetta 2(DE3) as the expression host (see Materials and\nMethods). pQR numbers (the Ward group plasmid identifier)\nwere consecutively assigned from pQR2595 to pQR2623 (see\nprotein IDs in Supporting Information).\nIREDs sequence and phylogenetic analyses\nMultiple sequence alignment of the IREDs was performed using\nthe Clustal Omega online tool, including protein sequences of\nwell-characterised IREDs with known stereoselectivities: (R)-\nIRED_Skan (set as numbering reference), (R)-IRED_Aory (Asper-\ngillus oryzae, Q2TW47) and (S)-IRED_Pelg (Paenibacillus elgii,\nWP_010497949.1) (Figure 1). The sequence similarity of the\nIREDs ranged from 29 % to 71 % . Regarding the cofactor\nbinding site, all IREDs contained a full-length Rossmann-fold\ndomain GxGxxG consensus sequence and a highly conserved\nVWNR sequence (except pQR2619 with IWNR) (Figure 1). Key\namino acid residues in the active site, D187 or Y187, are\nassociated with the (R)- and (S)-stereoselectivity, respectively;\nalthough this in not fully understood until now.\n[17]\nTwenty-one\nIREDs had one of these residues in this position, whilst some\nIREDs showed either E187 (pQR2596, 2610, 2616 and 2622) or\nN187 (pQR2603, 2606, 2614 and 2619) (Figure 1). The presence\nof E187 has been reported previously, with this residue acting\nas a proton donor during catalysis (similar to D187); however,\nN187 is not commonly found in IREDs. In fact, IREDs can be\ngrouped based on this amino acid residue, as depicted in the\nphylogenetic tree (Figure 2), with E187 being more closely\nrelated to the D187 subgroup, and N187 related to the Y187\nsubgroup.\nIn addition, an interesting amino acid conservation pattern\nwas observed in position 196 that is coincidentally found in\neach subgroup in the phylogenetic tree, which allows us to\nsub-divide these IREDs into 8 additional subgroups, as\nsummarised in Table 1. The D187 subgroup (pQR2598, 2600,\n2604, 2608 and 2611) including (R)-IRED_Aory (first RedAm to\nbe reported)\n[15]\nhas a highly conserved G196; all Y187 (except\npQR2607) and some D187 IREDs (subgroup pQR2609, 2612,\n2615, 2620 and 2621), are closely related and show a conserved\nT196. Likewise, E187 and N187 show highly conserved P196\nand A196, respectively; the remaining D187 IREDs (pQR2595,\n2601 and IRED_Skan) show conserved S196, except pQR2618\nwith G199 and pQR2602 with A196.\nMoreover, N108 was highly conserved amongst all these\nIREDs except for E187 IREDs containing T108 instead. These\nspecific amino acid residues might play a significant role either\nin stereoselectivity or activity; however, this is beyond the aim\nof our study and would need to be proved experimentally.\nTable 1.

Most IREDs showed\ngood expression levels in the soluble fraction (see SDS-PAGE\nanalysis in Supporting Information). IRED activities were\nscreened (as clarified lysates) against model compound sub-\nstrates: 2-methyl-1-pyrroline to test imine reductase activity\n(IRED activity, Scheme 2a) and cyclohexanone or 2-hexanone\nwith methylamine as amino donor (1 : 8 eq.) to test reductive\naminase activity (RedAm activity, Scheme 2b and 2c); all at pH 7\nand 9 and in the presence of either NADPH or NADH.\nA summary of the results is shown in Scheme 2d as a heat\nmap based on the comparison of initial rates calculated\nfollowing cofactor consumption, using empty plasmid-clarified\nlysate and free-clarified lysate reaction as controls. IREDs\nbelonging to the D187 \u0000 G196 subgroup showed modest to\ngood expression levels; remarkably, pQR2598, 2600 and 2611\nwere highly active showing a broad range of activity with all\nsubstrates, cofactors and at both pH values; however, pQR2604,\n2608 and 2618 showed poor activity levels for all substrates and\nconditions; therefore, we can infer that IREDs broad activity\ncannot be associated to these particular amino acid residue\nsubgroups. IRED pQR2602 (D187 \u0000 A196 sub-group) showed also\nsimilar broad activity. Only three IREDs (pQR2603, 2608 and\n2621) showed extremely poor or no activity, which might be\ndue to low expression levels or lack of appropriate substrates.\nThe remaining IREDs expressed well but showed variable\nactivity under the experimental conditions. Hence, based on\nour screening results, and in agreement with previous publica-\ntions, IRED activity-specificity is highly substrate and cofactor\ndependent, and cannot easily be associated to a specific\nsubgroup or sequence motif.\nMost IREDs described to date have a natural preference for\nNADPH;\n[8]\nhere, IRED activity for most of the selected enzymes\nFigure 1.

RedAm activity is\nusually observed in some IREDs, which is favoured in the\npresence of an excess of the amine donor (8 eq. in this work)\nand at pH 9. Here, RedAm activity with cyclohexanone was\nhigher in the presence of NADPH; and on average, greater at\npH 9 for most of the IREDs evaluated. In addition, “true”\nRedAms, an IREDs subset, can catalyse the reductive amination\nof prochiral ketones with equimolar concentrations of the\namine donor and at pH 7;\n[10,21]\nalthough these conditions were\nnot tested in this study, from the phylogenetic perspective,\npQR2598, 2600 and 2608 are more closely related to (R)-IRED_\nAory (first “true” RedAm described);\n[10]\nhowever, based on our\ndata, it is unclear if these IREDs are “true” RedAms, and this will\nbe explored in the future.\nIRED-catalysed reactions with NADH as the cofactor would\nbe advantageous as this cofactor is more stable and cheaper\nthan NADPH, and it is also easier to regenerate enzymatically\nfor applications at a large scale.\n[13]\nThree IREDs (pQR2600, 2601\nand 2602; all from different subgroups) showed good IRED and\nRedAm activities, able to almost equally accept NADH. In this\nrespect, Borlinghaus et al. reported an alteration of cofactor\nspecificity for (R)-IRED_Ms (Mixococcus stipitatus) achieving a\n2900-fold improved NADH/NADPH specificity and enhanced\nactivity for the reduction of 2-methyl-1-pyrroline, concluding\nthat the key amino acid residues for NADH specificity are R50Y\n(R33Y in Ms) and particularly K54R (K37R in Ms).\n[36]\nAll IREDs in this study have a conserved R50 (used as a\nselection criteria), whilst only 13 and 16 IREDs contained K54\nand R54, respectively (Figure 1). Remarkably, and in contrast to\nprevious findings, all the N187 \u0000 A196 and E187 \u0000 P196 IREDs\nsubgroups have K54 (associated with low NADH specificity) but\nshowed moderate to good activity with NADH as a cofactor for\nthe reduction reactions (except pQR2606 with good activities in\npresence of NADPH). From this, we infer that E187 and N187\nIREDs prefer NADH as cofactor; this may be associated not only\nwith residue 187 but also residues near the cofactor binding\nsite motif (position 54) and active site motif (position 196).\nIn addition, reductive aminase activity has mainly been\ntested towards aromatic ketones with NADPH as the cofactor\nand methylamine as the amine.\n[37]\nOur results show that most\nIREDs had RedAm activity towards 2-cyclohexanone mainly in\npresence of NADPH; however, and irrespective of the level of\nactivity, RedAm activity towards the aliphatic ketone 2-\nhexanone was higher mainly in presence of NADH compared to\nNADPH and on average the best activity was observed at pH 7\n(Scheme 2d).\nScheme 2.

IRED activity results\nare shown in Scheme 3 as initial rates. It has previously been\nreported that W195 plays an important role in DHIQ substrate\naccommodation potentially causing steric hindrance and as an\nexplanation for the poor activity of IREDs, and this residue is\nparticularly critical for substrate binding in (S)-IREDs.\n[30]\nIt has\nalso been shown that F194 is important for substrate accom-\nmodation for 6,7-dimethoxylated-aryl \u0000 DHIQs (2 a and 5 a in this\nstudy); hence, a double mutant F194M \u0000 W195F showed up to\n6.8-fold improvement in catalytic activity for this substrate\ntype.\n[38]\nIn our study, the D187 IREDs associated to (R)-IRED_Aory\nhave a consensus M194 and Y/S/T/N195 residues; other D187\nIREDs have low conservation for the 194 residue with either M/\nF/C194, and highly conserved residue W195; these IREDs\nsubgroup were the most active towards the DHIQs evaluated.\nThe Y187 IREDs had a highly conserved F194 \u0000 W/L195 showing\noverall moderate activity, except pQR2599 and 2607, where\nboth were highly active towards 4 a. The E187 and N187 IREDs\ncontained highly conserved L194 \u0000 L195 and M194 \u0000 Y/W195,\nrespectively; both subgroups exhibited low activity towards the\nDHIQs, this might be associated to these specific amino acid\nresidues and their preference for NADH to catalyse the imine\nreduction.\nIn this work, four IREDs (pQR2595, 2600, 2601 and 2612)\nwere selected for the reduction of 1 a, 3 a, 4 a and 5 a into their\nrespective THIQs (Table 2). These IREDs belong to the D187\nsubgroup with a predicted (R)-stereoselectivity based on\nsequence analysis. Activity towards 2 a was inconclusive as\nmost IREDs showed similar activity values (at around 0.01 μmol/\nmLmin), and therefore this compound was not used further.\nTHIQ 4 b was difficult to synthesise chemically due to its high\ninstability, hence reaction yields were calculated based on 4 a\nconsumption. Most THIQ reaction yields after 24 h were\nrelatively low (21–44 %) except for 4 b which was catalysed by\npQR2600 (74 %). Interestingly, pQR2600 and 2601 accepted 1 a\nbut showed very low activity towards 3 a, which only differs by\nScheme 3. IREDs activity towards DHIQs 1 a–5 a for the synthesis of THIQs 1 b–5 b. Initial rates were calculated in duplicates after up to 2 h reaction: 20 μL of\nclarified lysate was mixed with 180 μL of reaction mixture containing 1 a–5 a (1 mM), DMSO (2.5 % v/v) and NADPH (0.2 mM) in TRIS \u0000 HCl buffer (50 mM, pH 7)\nat 30 ° C.\nTable 2.

In-situ NADPH\nrecycling was carried out by coupling IREDs reaction to a\nG6PDH with glucose-6-phosphate as the co-substrate\n[39]\n(Scheme 4). As expected, this allowed us to significantly\nincrease THIQ reaction yields by 1.2- to 4.4-fold, reaching for\nexample 98 % of 1 b, catalysed by pQR2601 (Table 2).\nNotably, pQR2595 and 2601 were highly stereoselective\nwith > 99 % (R)-3 b and (R)-1 b, respectively. Likewise, (R)-1 b\nwith a 93 % ee was obtained with pQR2600. For pQR2612, the\nmain product was (S)-5 b (> 99 % ee) in contrast to its predicted\nstereoselectivity based on residue D187 (Table 2). IRED inverse\nstereoselectivity has also been reported previously, although\nthis is not fully understood yet and it has been reported that\nP139 and F194 are potentially better predictors of stereo-\nselectivity other than only D/Y187.\n[17]\nNevertheless, pQR2612\n(with moderate activity towards model substrates) contains a\nP139 and an unusual C194 (the sole member of our IRED panel\nwith a Cys in this position) (Figure 1). Several IREDs reported for\nthe reduction of aryl \u0000 DHIQs into their respective aryl \u0000 THIQs are\n(S)-selective, which have been described to be more tolerant\ntowards bulkier substrates.\n[22]\nSome (R)-selective IREDs able to\nreduce aryl \u0000 DHIQs have been also reported but their substrate\nscope is more limited.\n[30]\nConclusions\nIREDs are promising biocatalysts for the synthesis of primary,\nsecondary, and tertiary chiral amines. Based on the phyloge-\nnetic analysis of the identified IREDs, they were grouped into\nfour subgroups based on amino acid residue 187, with Asp, Tyr,\nGlu or Asn in this key position. Here, in agreement with\npreviously reported work, IRED sequence-activity relationships\nare highly substrate dependent, and activity cannot be limited\nto any subgroup or sequence motif. Most of the twenty-nine\nnovel IREDs identified here expressed well. The majority showed\none or more type of activity (IRED and RedAm), with a\npreference for NADPH as the cofactor. However, three IREDs\nwere able to accept both NADPH and NADH. Remarkably, E/\nN187 IRED subgroups showed good activity and preference for\nNADH, which is advantageous from a process and cost\nperspective. In addition, reductive aminase activity towards 2-\nhexanone was favoured mainly in the presence of NADH, which\nneeds to be investigated further. Four selected IREDs were also\napplied in the synthesis of relevant THIQs, where coupling this\nreaction to a G6PDH cofactor recycling system significantly\nimproved reaction yields, of up to 98 %. Although the stereo-\nselectivity of IREDs is not fully understood yet; here, three\nselected IREDs matched the predicted stereoselectivity based\non sequence analysis; however, one IRED showed inverse\nstereoselectivity which cannot be fully explained at this stage.\nMaterial and methods\nChemicals, strains, and plasmids\nAll chemicals were purchased from Merck KGaA (Sigma-Aldrich)\nand molecular biology reagents were from New England Biotech-\nnology, otherwise stated.

All\nrecombinant IREDs have a C-terminal His\n6\nTag.\nEnzymes expression and cell lysis\nTwenty-nine IREDs were selected (pQR2595-2623) for further\nexpression and activity screening experiments. They were put in a\n96-deep-well plate (position from A1 to C5) in duplicate (position\nfrom D1 to F5), including E. coli BL21(DE3) with empty pET29a + as\nnegative control (C6 and F6). Expression was with 1 mL of TB-broth\nper well with kanamycin 50 μg/mL at 37 ° C and 1200 rpm in a\nThermomixer™ C (Eppendorf, UK), IPTG induction (0.5 mM final\nconcentration) to an OD\n600nm\n~ 1.5 and the temperature was then\nreduced to 25 ° C for 15 h. The plate containing IREDs was then\ncentrifuged (4500 rpm at 4 ° C for 30 min) and cell pellets were\nresuspended in 0.2 mL of 50 mM TRIS \u0000 HCl buffer pH 7. Cells were\ndisrupted by partially submerging the IRED-plate in a water bath\nsonicator (Bransonic 2800 CPX2800H-E, Branson) as previously\ndescribed.\n[40]\nThe clarified lysates were recovered in a fresh 96-well\nplate and kept at 4 ° C for enzymatic activity screening and protein\nquantification.\nScheme 4.

However,\nthey su ﬀer from side reactions or the use of expensive\ntransition-metal complexes with chiral ligands that can be\ndiﬃcult to obtain and remove.\n3,4 A biocatalyst provides a new\nchoice for green and eﬃcient synthesis of chiral amines.5,6\nNADPH dependent imine reductases (IREDs) are one of the\nmost attractive biocatalysts for the synthesis of chiral\namines.\n7–10 Since IREDs were identi ed by Nagasawa and\nco-workers in 2010, they have been reported to reduce\nstructurally di ﬀerent imines and synthesize diverse chiral\namines.11 A subfamily of IREDs is fascinating for creating\nsecondary or tertiary amines by reductive amination of\npro-chiral ketones or aldehydes and amines in equal\nstoichiometric amounts, which is the most straightforward\nstrategy for the generation of alkylamines.12 Notably, IREDs\nhave been reported to accept a wide range of ketones and\namines\n12–27 and successfully applied to the commercial\nmanufacture of LSD1 inhibitor GSK2879552 and JAK1 inhibitor\nabrocitinib.\n28,29\nEnantiomers frequently behave very diﬀerently in biological\nsystems due to their diﬀerent shapes in 3-dimensional space in\ndrug molecules; thus producing both enantiomers is an\nimportant task in the pharmaceutical industry.30,31 Since the\ndiscovery of these R- and S-selective IREDs, they have been\ncapable of the asymmetric reduction of various prochiral imine\nsubstrates with a high degree of stereoselectivity.\n11,32,33\nAccording to a large number of reported substrate screenings,\nIREDs are also selectively preferred in IRED catalytic reductive\namination reactions.\n12,18,25 Therefore, to access both the\noptically pure enantiomers, it is o en necessary to screen\nan extensive enzyme library to obtain complementary\nstereoselective IREDs. 13,16,24–27 However, the target natural\nenzymes are o en not suitable for industrial application\nbecause of their low catalytic eﬃciency or thermostability. In\nthis case, large mutagenesis e ﬀorts for complementary\nstereoselective enzymes are needed to meet the requirements of\nindustrial processes.\n26,28,29 Alternatively, rationally engineering\nan enzyme, which shows high catalytic eﬃciency for target\nsubstrates, to obtain enantio-preference enzymes is a highly\neﬃcient method. 34–38 Rational design usually focuses on\na minority of potential amino acids, which can signicantly\nreduce the number of mutants to be investigated.37,38 Although\naTianjin Institute of Industrial Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Tianjin\n300308, China.

Recently, asymmetric imine reduction of\npyrrolidinamine building blocks of pharmaceuticals using\nIRED has been well studied.43–45 We also reported a wild type\nIRED IR-G36 fromA. hymeniacidonis, which was engineered to\nobtain a mutant M5 producing a diverse spectrum of piperidine\nand azepane alkylamines through reductive amination, with\nexcellent catalytic eﬃciency, R-selectivity, and thermostability.\n26\nHowever, when usingN-Boc-3-pyrrolidone 1 as a ketone donor,\nM5 displayed poor stereoselectivity with an ee value of 44% (R),\ndespite high catalytic eﬃciency with substrate loading up to 19\ngL −1. Thus, M5 has emerged as an attractive starting point for\nexploring the preparation of bothR- and S-pyrrolidinamines.\nGiven the importance of pyrrolidinamines, we performed the\nmechanism- and structure-guided semi-rational design\nof IRED-M5 to acquire variants with a high degree of enantio-\ncomplementary stereoselectivities for e ﬃcient synthesis of\na series of pyrrolidinamines. Based on the eﬃcient platform,\nchemoenzymatic synthesis of key intermediates of JAK1\ninhibitor 4 (ref. 46) and leniolisib was performed with fewer\nsteps compared to previous chemical methods using pro-chiral\nstarting material1 (Fig. 1B).\nHerein, we report an IRED-catalyzed stereo-divergent reductive\namination strategy for synthesizing key intermediates,\npyrrolidiamines, enabled by the directed evolution of IREDs. This\nenzymatic reaction was key to delivering a new process starting\nfrom a pro-chiral compound with reduced cost and fewer steps\nfor the synthesis of enantio-complementary pyrrolidiamines, key\nintermediates for both leniolisib and JAK1 inhibitor 4,\nrespectively.\nSemi-rational design\nAccording to the catalytic mechanism of IRED, the carbonyl\nsubstrate couples to the amine substrate to form the imine\nintermediate aer deprotonation and elimination of a water\nmolecule. Then, the imine is reduced by the cofactor NADPH to\ngive the nal chiral amine product. As such, the imine\nFig. 1 Pyrrolidinamine containing drug molecules and its synthetic application.\n4266 | Chem. Sci.,2 0 2 3 ,14,4 2 6 5–4272 © 2023 The Author(s).

Thus, the amino acids that interact\ndirectly with the ketone moiety are the most inuential ones for\ncontrolling stereoselectivity, which is supported by previous\nstudies showing that diﬀerent amine donors have less eﬀect on\nthe stereoselectivity of IRED catalyzed reactions in their\nsubstrate scope studies.\n12,18,25,26\nIn this study,N-Boc-pyrrolidone 1 and benzylamine a were\ninitially chosen as the model substrates for M5-catalyzed\nreductive amination.

The docking result\nindicated that the N-Boc-piperidine moiety faces the side\nopening of the tunnel (Fig. 2A), which is consistent with the\nrelative position of ketone in the reported quaternary complex\nof AtRedAm.\n46 Thus, we assumed that the residues controlling\nstereoselectivity were located near the side opening of the active\npocket.\nAnalysis of the docking result indicated thatve amino acid\nresidues I149, M203, W234, S241, and F260, were identied to\ninteract directly with the N-Boc-piperidine moiety (Fig. 2A).\nNoteworthily, two residues W234 and F260 are located on either\nside of theN-Boc-piperidine moiety respectively, and their large\nside chains generate steric hindrance to the bulkyN-Boc group,\nwhich restrains the imine intermediate to rotate freely along the\naxis (Fig. 2B), suggesting that they are important in providing\na steric constraint for controlling the face for hydride delivery.\nThus, a larger cavity at the tryptophan 234 or phenylalanine 260\npositions could better facilitate access to the bulkyN-Boc group.\nIn other words, mutating W234 to a smaller amino acid might\ncreate more space for the predominant Pro-(S) conformer of the\nimine intermediate in the active site. Otherwise, exchanging\nF260 with a smaller amino acid might cause the predominant\nPro-(R) conformer (Fig. 2B).\nSubsequently, site-saturation mutagenesis was performed at\npositions 234 and 260, respectively, to investigate the\nstereoselectivities corresponding with the volume of the\nresidue, and the result is shown in Fig. 2C and D. As expected,\nmost of the mutants at position 260 enhanced R-selectivity\nexcept F260W, implying that exchanging large F260 with a\nsmaller residue oﬀers a large enough pocket for the bulkyN-Boc\ngroup to improve the binding ability of the Pro-(R) conformer of\nthe imine intermediate. Three mutations led to >85%\nR-selectivity, and the highestR-selective mutants were F260D\n(93% ee), F260E (92% ee), and F260N (88% ee). However,\nwhen F260 was replaced by two positively charged amino\nacids with long chains, the mutants F260K and F260R\nalmost lost their catalytic activity (Fig. 2C). Mutations at\nposition 234 are also in line with our expectations. Most\nof the mutants showed reversed stereoselectivity, and\ntwo mutants W234I and W234L showed the bestS-selectivity\nwith ee values of 82% and 81%, respectively. These results\nindicated that the residue at position 234 was crucial for the\nenantioselectivity via tuning the size of the stereospecicity\npocket and acting as a switch for complementary\nstereoselectivities.\nTo further improveR- andS-stereoselectivity, the other three\nresidues I149, M203, and S241 were investigated. Three amino\nacids of di ﬀerent sizes alanine (A), leucine (L), and\nphenylalanine (F) were chosen for site-specic mutagenesis\nover M5. As shown in Fig. 3, I149F, I149L, and S241L showed\nenhanced R-selectivity with ee values of 84%, 79%, and 85%,\nrespectively. In contrast, the mutant I149A showed a reversed\nFig. 2 (A) Docking the imine intermediate of reductive amination of1 and a into the M5 cavity showsﬁve residues that directly interact with the\nN-Boc-piperidine moiety.

However, the\nmutations of M203A, M203F, and M203L showed no\nS-stereoselectivity. All results indicate that residues that interact\ndirectly with the N-Boc-piperidine moiety have signi cant\neﬀects on stereoselectivity.\nBoth enantioselective variants were optimized utilizing\ncombinational mutagenesis. First, we combined the\nR-stereoselective mutant s F260D, F260E, and F260N with\nS241F and I149L, respectively. As a result, the combinatorial\nvariants S241L/F260D, S241L/F260E and S241L/F260N\nshowed excellent R-selectivity with an ee value of 99%,\nwhile the combinational variants of I149F and site F260\ndisplayed dramatically decreased catalytic activity. Aerward,\nwe investigated the combination of I149A and W234I to\nsynthesize (S)-1a. Although the combinatorial variant I149A/\nW234I showed improved S-selectivity with an ee value of\n97%, it did not meet the biocatalyst criteria for industrial\napplication. To gain deeper insight into the contribution of\nsite I149 on S-selectivity, we carried out saturation mutation\non this hot position over W234I. To our delight, two variants\nI149D/W234I and I149H/W234I showed the bestS-selectivity\nwith ee values of 99% (Table 1). While all the double mutants\nshowed comparable high enantioselectivities, their catalytic\nactivities may vary widely. Thus, 5 mL-scale biotransformation\nstarted with N-Boc-3-pyrrolidinone 1 and benzylamine\nhydrochloride a (1.1 eq.) using puried enzymes (5 mg mL\n−1),\nand the results are assessed in Table 1. It was found that the\ncatalytic activity of S241L/F260N was higher than that of\nS241L/F260D and S241L/F260E among theR-selective variants,\nwith a conversion of 99%. The best S-selective variant was\nI149D/W234I with a conversion of 99%, which was about 50%\nhigher than that of I149H/W234I.\nFig. 3 Enantioselectivity of M5 and its mutants in the reductive ami-\nnation of1 and a.\nTable 1 M5 mutant-catalyzed reductive amination for the synthesis of (R)- and (S)-1a.

GDH was used for the NADPH recycling system\nand DMSO (20% v/v) was added as a co-solvent supporting the\nsolubility of ketone1 in the phosphate buﬀer (PBS) at pH 7.0.\nAlthough amine donors of diﬀerent types and volumes were\nutilized, most reactions catalyzed by S241L/F260N and I149D/\nW234I showed excellent enantioselectivity with ee values (>99%,\nR)a n d( > 9 9 % ,S), respectively, which again indicated that amine\ndonors had relatively less inuence on the stereoselectivity of\nIRED-catalyzed reductive aminations. In terms of conversion,ve\nchain amines ( a–e)a r ee ﬃciently processed to create the\ncorresponding amine products 1a–1d in good to excellent\nconversions (76 –99%). An obvious preference for\ncyclopropanaminef among the four cyclic aminesf–i was found\nin the reactions, and the conversions were up to 90% and 99%,\nrespectively. Sterically hindered aminesg–i, which were poor\namine donors for our previous report,\n26 showed low to moderate\nconversions (11–63%) in this study, and even a trace amount of1i\ncould be detected in the reactions. Additionally, the\nreactions between1 and the aminesj and k gave moderate to high\nconversions (29–95%), highlighting that the binding pockets of\nboth variants are large enough for the bulky substrates.\nSynthetic application in the synthesis of leniolisib and JAK1\ninhibitor intermediates\nWe then began to apply the IRED mutant to prepare\npyrrolidinamine intermediates 2 and 3 of the potential drug\nmolecules leniolisib and JAK1 inhibitor4. Leniolisib is an orally\nactive, potent PI3Kd selective inhibitor with suitable properties\nand eﬃcacy for clinical development as an anti-inammatory\nand anti-neoplastic therapeutic. 40,44,45 In 2018, Kim and\nco-workers reported4 as a potential rheumatoid arthritis drug\ncandidate. Its inhibitory activity and selectivity for JAK1 over\nother JAKs were based on replacing the piperidine moiety of\ntofacitinib with a pyrrolidine moiety.\n47\nThe newly developed IRED catalyzed reductive amination\nenabled us to complete the synthesis of core skeleton3 in two\nsteps and2 in three steps from pro-chiral compound1, which\nare more e ﬃcient than the reported ones from pro-chiral\ncompounds. Our synthesis started with cheaper and\ncommercially available N-Boc-piperidone 1, which underwent\nasymmetric reductive amination catalyzed by the I149D/W234I\nmutant to give (S)-3-pyrrolidinamine 1a in 84% (99% ee) yield\n(Scheme 1). The benzyl protecting group was removed under the\nconditions of Pd/C with H\n2 in MeOH to obtain free amine in\n72% yield. The SNAr reaction with pyrimidine5 was performed\nto produce the core skeleton 2 of leniolisib in 90% yield.\nAlternatively, treatment of N-Boc-piperidone 1 with mutant\nS241L/F260N successfully synthesized pyrrolidinamine 1b in\n81% yield with R-conguration in 99% ee. The reaction with\n6-chloro-7-deazapurine 6 under the conditions of K2CO3 in H2O\nreux for 24 h gave the key intermediate3 in 52% yield. Notably,\nin the SNAr reaction step, the Boc protecting group was also\nremoved under basic conditions.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, we constructed a biocatalytic platform for the\nenantio-complementary synthesis of pyrrolidinamines via\nengineered IRED-catalyzed reductive amination. Based on\nmechanism- and structure-guided semi-rational design, we\ndemonstrate that amino acids interacting directly with the ketone\nmoiety are hot spots for stereoselective modication. Two key sites\n234 and 260 were recognized as the crucial“switches” which\ncontrol the imine intermediate with Pro-(S)o rP r o - (R)c o n f o r m e r s\nin the active site.

The structure ofAdRedAm has been\ndetermined in three forms. The ﬁrst form, which belongs to space groupP3121\nand was reﬁned to 2.01 A˚ resolution, features two molecules (one dimer) in the\nasymmetric unit in complex with the redox-inactive cofactor NADPH4.T h e\nsecond form, which belongs to space group C21 and was reﬁned to 1.73 A˚\nresolution, has nine molecules (four and a half dimers) in the asymmetric unit,\neach complexed with NADP+. The third form, which belongs to space group\nP3121 and was reﬁned to 1.52 A˚ resolution, has one molecule (one half-dimer) in\nthe asymmetric unit. This structure was again complexed with NADP+ and also\nwith the substrate 2,2-diﬂuoroacetophenone. The different data sets permit\nthe analysis of AdRedAm in different conformational states and also reveal\nthe molecular basis of stereoselectivity in the transformation of ﬂuorinated\nacetophenone substrates by the enzyme.\n1. Introduction\nChiral amines are important functionalities in biologically\nactive molecules and their asymmetric synthesis by reductive\namination is a signiﬁcant reaction in industrial medicinal\nchemistry (Afanasyev et al., 2019). Recently, a subset of\nNADPH-dependent imine reductase (IRED; Grogan &\nTurner, 2016; Mangas-Sanchezet al., 2017) enzymes have been\nidentiﬁed that catalyze the reductive amination of a range of\nketones with small amine donors when supplied at one stoi-\nchiometric equivalent (Fig. 1a;A l e k uet al., 2017; Gilioet al.,\n2022). These ‘reductive aminases’ (RedAms; Alekuet al.,\n2017; Gilio et al., 2022) have now been applied in the multi-\nkilogram (Schober et al., 2019) and ton (Kumaret al., 2021)\nscale synthesis of pharmaceutical precursors by many indus-\ntrial (Schoberet al., 2019; Kumaret al., 2021; Maet al., 2021)\nand academic (Mangas-Sanchezet al., 2020; Yanget al., 2021;\nZhang et al., 2022; Chenet al., 2023; Gilioet al., 2023) groups.\nRedAms were ﬁrst identiﬁed in enzymes from fungi, and\nstructures of two of them, AspRedAm from Aspergillus\noryzae (Aleku et al., 2017) and AtRedAm from A. terreus\n(Sharma et al., 2018), each in complex with the NADP\n+\ncofactor and substrate or product molecules, have been\npublished by our group.\nThese and other RedAms from fungi have been applied\nin a number of preparative imine reductions and reductive\naminations (Mangas-Sanchezet al., 2020; Ramsdenet al., 2019;\nGonza´ lez-Martı´ nez et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021).

{"text": "reported to be more stable thanAspRedAm (Zachos et al.,\n2021) and thus perhaps more suitable for process applications.\nIndeed, AdRedAm has already been applied to the asym-\nmetric reduction of imine substrates, including dibenzazepines\nsuch as4 (Fig. 1b; Franceet al., 2017) and pyrrolidines such as\n6 (Fig. 1c; Costaet al., 2018), and also the reductive amination\nof cyclohexanone (1) with various amines (Alekuet al., 2017).\nIn addition, AdRedAm has been used in a biocatalytic ﬂow\nsystem for the reductive amination of hydrocinnamaldehyde\n(8) with allylamine (9)( F i g .1d; Finnigan et al., 2020). Given\nthe enduring interest in AdRedAm as a catalyst, we have\ndetermined its structure using X-ray crystallography to assist\nin the interpretation of experimental biotransformation results\nand also for structure-guided engineering. The structure,\nwhich has been obtained in three crystal forms, sheds light on\nthe conformational dynamics of the enzyme, cofactor binding,\nand also the molecular determinants of stereoselectivity in the\ntransformations of the substrate 2,2-diﬂuoroacetophenone.\n2. Materials and methods\n2.1. Macromolecule production\nCloning and expression of the gene encodingAdRedAm\nand puriﬁcation of the protein have been reported previously\n(Aleku et al., 2017). The protein, which was puriﬁed using\nnickel-afﬁnity chromatography followed by size-exclusion\nchromatography, was concentrated to 40 mg ml\n/C0 1 using\ncentrifugal concentrators with a molecular-weight cutoff of\n10 kDa.\n2.2. Crystallization\nConcentrated protein at 40 mg ml/C0 1 was subjected to crys-\ntallization trials in a range of commercial screens in 96-well\nplate format, using 150 nl protein solution and 150 nl preci-\npitant solution and a Mosquito robot (SPT Labtech). Crystals\nfor data set 1 were harvested from conditions consisting of\n0.1 M PCTP buffer (sodium propionate, sodium cacodylate\ntrihydrate, bis-Tris propane) pH 4.0, 25% PEG 1500 with the\nprotein pre-complexed with 2 mM NADPH\n4. Crystals for data\nset 2 were recovered from conditions consisting of 0.1M MES\nbuffer pH 6.0, 0.2M MgCl2, 20% PEG 6000 with the protein\npre-complexed with 2 mM NADP+. Crystals for data set 3\nwere grown in 100 mM phosphate buffer pH 8.6, 0.2M MgCl2,\n20%(w/v) PEG 3350 with the protein pre-complexed with\n2m M NADP+ and 10 mM 2,2-diﬂuoroacetophenone. Crys-\ntallization information is summarized in Table 1.\n2.3. Data collection and processing\nData were collected on beamlines I03 and I04-1 at the\nDiamond Light Source (DLS) and were processed and inte-\ngrated using XDS (Kabsch, 2010) and scaled usingSCALA\n(Evans, 2006) within the xia2 (Winter, 2010) processing\nsystem. Data-collection statistics can be found in Table 2.\nresearch communications\nActa Cryst. (2023).

Structure solution and refinement\nCrystals furnishing data set 1 were obtained in space group\nP3121 with two molecules in the asymmetric unit constituting\none dimer. The structure was solved withMOLREP (Vagin &\nTeplyakov, 2010) using the structure of the imine reductase\nfrom A. oryzae (54% sequence identity; PDB entry 5g6r;\nAleku et al., 2017) as the molecular-replacement model. The\nstructure was solved using iterative cycles ofCoot (Emsley\net al., 2010) and REFMAC (Murshudov et al., 2011). After\nbuilding the protein backbone, side chains and water mole-\ncules, residual density was present in the omit map in one\nactive site. This could be modelled and reﬁned as the inactive\ncofactor molecule NADP\n4. Data sets 2 and 3, in space groups\nC21 and P3121, respectively, were processed, built and reﬁned\nin a similar fashion to data set 1, yielding structures with nine\nand one monomers in the asymmetric unit, respectively. Data\nset 2 featured density consistent with nine molecules of\nNADP\n+ in nine active sites; data set 3 featured density\nconsistent with one molecule of NADP+ in its active site, and\nalso residual density adjacent to the nicotinamide ring of\nthe cofactor that was successfully modelled and reﬁned as\n2,2-diﬂuoroacetophenone (15). The Ramachandran plot for\nthe structure from data set 1 revealed 99.6% of residues in\nfavoured regions, with 0.4% outliers. The corresponding\nﬁgures for data sets 2 and 3 were also 99.6% of residues in\nfavoured regions with 0.4% outliers. Reﬁnement statistics for\nthe structures can be found in Table 3. Coordinates and\nstructure-factor ﬁles have been deposited in the Protein Data\nBank (PDB) for data sets 1, 2 and 3 with accession codes 8ozw,\n8p2j and 8ozv, respectively.\n3. Results and discussion\nThe gene encoding AdRedAm was codon-optimized for\nexpression in Escherichia coli and was expressed in E. coli\nBL21 (DE3) cells. The enzyme was puriﬁed by nickel-afﬁnity\n(Ni–NTA) chromatography and size-exclusion chromato-\ngraphy (SEC) using previously described methods (Aleku\net al., 2017), and the pure protein was concentrated to\n40 mg ml\n/C0 1 for crystallization. The enzyme crystallized in\nthree forms. The ﬁrst form (data set 1), which belonged to\nspace group P3\n121 and was reﬁned to 2.01 A˚ resolution,\ncontained two molecules in the asymmetric unit representing\none dimer. The second form (data set 2), which belonged to\nspace groupC2\n1 and was reﬁned to 1.73 A˚ resolution, had nine\nmolecules in the asymmetric unit, representing four and a half\ndimers. The third form (data set 3) belonged to space group\nP3\n121 and was reﬁned to 1.52 A˚ resoution.

Data-collection and reﬁnement statistics can be found in\nTables 2 and 3.\nUsing data set 1, the structure ofAdRedAm was solved\nusing the structure ofAspRedAm (sequence identity of 54%)\nas a model. The structure was built and reﬁned using iterative\ncycles of building inCoot and reﬁnement inREFMAC.T h i s\ndata set yielded two molecules in the asymmetric unit as a\ndimer, which is the canonical form of previously described\nimine reductases (Alekuet al., 2016, 2017; Rodrı´ guez-Mata et\nal., 2013; Huberet al., 2014; Manet al., 2015). Electron density\nfor the backbone atoms was largely complete throughout the\nlength of both chains from Ala2 to Lys288. The monomer of\nAdRedAm was compared with existing structures using the\nDALI server (Holm, 2022). Its closest structural homologs\nwere AspRedAm (PDB entry 5g6r; Z-score 34.6; 54%\nsequence identity; r.m.s.d. of 1.0 A˚ over 289 C\n/C11atoms; Aleku\net al., 2017), NfRedAm from Neosartorya fumigata (PDB\nentry 6sle; Z-score 33.8; 50% sequence identity; r.m.s.d. of\n1.2 A˚ over 278 C/C11atoms; Mangas-Sanchezet al., 2020) and the\nimine reductase fromStreptosporangium roseum (PDB entry\n5ocm; 39% sequence identity; r.m.s.d. of 1.2 A˚ over 282 C/C11\natoms; Lenzet al., 2018).AdRedAm adopts the known IRED\nfold, with an N-terminal NADP +-binding domain (Ala2–\nVal162) connected by a long inter-domain helix (Gly163–\nSer192) to a C-terminal helical bundle (Ala193–Lys288)\n(Fig. 2a).\nThe twoAdRedAm monomers associate to form a dimer in\nwhich reciprocal domain sharing results in the formation of a\nlarge active-site cleft between the N-terminal domain of one\nmonomer and the C-terminal domain of its partner. In the\nstructure from data set 1, following building of the protein and\nwater molecules one of the active sites featured clear density\nin the omit map that could be modelled as the redox-inactive\ncofactor NADPH\n4, with which the protein had been\ncomplexed (Fig. 2 b). Interestingly, the other active site\nfeatured no cofactor density. A comparison of monomers with\nand without NADPH4 showed that the side chain of Asn94\nwas rotated approximately 180/C14 to accommodate the ribose of\nthe cofactor, but that the orientation of the other side chains\nwas largely conserved.\nresearch communications\nActa Cryst.

The symmetry neighbour has been incorporated (C atoms in brown) to show the contribution of both monomers\nin the active site. The ligand 2,2-diﬂuoroacetophenone (15) is shown with C atoms in yellow. Electron density in blue corresponds to the unbiasedFo /C0 Fc\nmaps at a level of 2.5/C27obtained before reﬁnement of the ligand atoms, which have been added for clarity.\nDespite a sequence homology of only 54%, the active site\nof AdRedAm is highly conserved compared with that of\nAspRedAm (for example PDB entry 5g6r; Alekuet al., 2017),\nwith Asp169 and Asn94, which are thought to have roles in\namine activation in the reductive aminase mechanism (Sharma\net al., 2018), and Tyr177, which is implicated in ketone acti-\nvation, superimposing well with the equivalent residues in\nAspRedAm (Fig. 2b). In addition, hydrophobic residues in\nAspRedAm that were shown to form a binding pocket for\nketone substrates (Alekuet al., 2017), including Leu173 and\nMet176 from the interdomain helix and Trp208 and Met212\nfrom the C-terminal domain of the partner monomer\n(monomer B in Fig. 2b), are also conserved, with Met237 and\nGln238 at the front of the active site.\nThe sequences and structures are less conserved in other\nregions. In the N-terminal domain ofAdRedAm there are\nseveral differences between Ser60 and His110 when compared\nwith AspRedAm, including Lys70 (Asn69 in AspRedAm),\nwhich forms an ionic interaction with Glu102 (Lys101) in\nAdRedAm. There are also differences at Trp84 (Leu83) and\nTrp106 (Phe105), residues that both project into the hydro-\nphobic core of the N-terminal domain that also includes Leu77\n(Leu76) and Ile89 (Ile88), which are both conserved between\nthe enzymes. In addition, the hydroxyl group of Thr103 in\nAdRedAm, which is replaced by Leu102 inAspRedAm, forms\na new hydrogen bond to the backbone carbonyl group of\nHis99 (Gln98).\nHowever, the major difference in tertiary structure between\nthe AdRedAm andAspRedAm monomers is a shorter loop of\n11 residues between Leu189 and Gly199 (L VQSANIPAAG)\nin the C-terminal helical bundle in AdRedAm, which was\n14 residues (LIKSGQDTSTTATG) between Leu189 and\nGly202 in AspRedAm. This loop, which is at the dimer\ninterface, positions Ala193 and Ile195 in AdRedAm for\nhydrophobic interactions with Leu164 and Leu167 in the\npartner monomer. Just downstream of this loop, in the region\nbetween Val190 and Thr210, Val190 (Ile190), Ile195 (Asp195),\nLeu189 (Leu189) and Phe200 (Leu203) also make hydro-\nphobic interactions with Ala171 and Leu172 of the neigh-\nbouring monomer at the dimer interface. Recent studies of the\nengineering of IREDs for improved stability using random\nmutagenesis suggest that mutations that enhance interactions,\nincluding hydrophobic forces, at the dimer interface were\nsigniﬁcant in producing variants with greater process stability\n(Schober et al., 2019; Kumaret al., 2021; Maet al., 2021) and,\nindeed, previous research has suggested that AdRedAm is\nmore stable than AspRedAm (Zachos et al., 2021). A\ncomparative analysis of AspRedAm and AdRedAm using\nPISA (Krissinel & Henrick, 2007) suggests thatAdRedAm\nshould be more stable, with a monomer–monomer interfacial\ninteraction of 4107 A˚\n2 versus 3918 A˚2. This would suggest a\nfree energy of dissociation of/C0 84.8 kJ mol/C0 1 for AdRedAm\nversus /C0 78.3 kJ mol/C0 1 for AspRedAm and thus greater\nstability, as observed experimentally.\nThe AdRedAm dimer observed in the structure from data\nset 1 was already instructive in showing two possible states of\nthe monomer in which the non-natural cofactor molecule was\neither absent or bound. Variations were also readily observed\namongst the four dimers present in the structure from data set\n2, which was obtained from crystals that grew in space group\nC2\n1 and featured nine molecules in the asymmetric unit. In\nthis structure, once again, the vast majority of backbone atoms\ncould be modelled in subunitsA–I from, in some cases, the\nleucine and phenylalanine residues in the puriﬁcation tag at\npositions /C0 5 and /C0 4 through to Lys288. The exception was\nchain H, in which electron density for Gly229–Gly232 was\npoor and could not be modelled. In the case of data set 2, all\nmonomers featured electron density in the omit maps that\ncould be modelled as the cofactor NADP\n+. Despite the\npresence of the cofactor in all monomers, the difference in the\nconformation of some monomers was pronounced. In the most\ndivergent examples, monomers E and I exhibited a hinge\nmovement between the N-terminal and C-terminal domains of\n14.8\n/C14 as calculated using theDynDom server (Fig. 2c; Lee et\nal., 2003), with the hinge movement centred around the\npendant aspartate residue Asp169. This was comparable to the\nmost pronounced difference in conformation observed in\nmultiple dimer structures ofAtRedAm (Sharmaet al., 2018).\nThe overall effect of the hinge movement is to close the active\nsite with respect to the cofactor, presumably to provide the\nhydrophobic environment that is required to favour greater\nstability of the transient imine intermediate.\nThe structure that resulted from data set 3 was more\nunusual, although not unique amongst IRED structures, in\nfeaturing only one monomer (for example PDB entry 6skx;\nMangas-Sanchez et al., 2020) or a half-dimer within the\nasymmetric unit. However, this data set provides signiﬁcant\nfurther information on ligand recognition withinAdRedAm.\nThis structure was obtained from crystals that had been\nco-crystallized with the ligand 2,2-diﬂuoroacetophenone (15;\nFig. 3) in an effort to shed light on the mixed selectivity of\nAdRedAm towards ﬂuorinated acetophenones, for which\nboth alcohol products and reductive amination products are\nobserved (Gonza´ lez-Martı´ nez et al., 2020). Fluorinated aceto-\nphenones are unusual amongst IRED substrates as, with the\nexception of some examples using engineered enzymes (Jiaet\nal., 2021), these ketones are the only examples of carbonyl\ncompounds that undergo signiﬁcant reduction to the alcohol\n(Gonza´ lez-Martı´ nez et al., 2020; Lenzet al., 2017).\nIndeed, when presented with 15, the reduced cofactor\nNADPH and methylamine,AdRedAm catalyzes the forma-\ntion of the (S)-alcohol product16 and the (S)-amine product\n17 in 47% and 25% yield, respectively (Fig. 3), whereas the\nreduction of acetophenone (11) or 2,2,2-triﬂuoroacetophenone\n(18) under the same conditions gave only theN-methyl (12)o r\nalcohol products (19), respectively (Gonza´ lez-Martı´ nez et al.,\n2020).\nA previous structure of an IRED fromS. roseumreported\nby our group (SrIRED; PDB entry 5ocm Lenzet al., 2018) was\npresented in complex with the hydrate20 of ketone 18 and\nsuggested that the signiﬁcant disposition towards ketone\nreduction in the case of18 may be due not only to the extra\nactivation of the carbonyl C atom, but also to aspects of\nspeciﬁc substrate recognition within the active site.

F79, 224–230\ncomplex showed that the ﬂuorine substituents of 20 made\nhydrogen-bonding interactions with the O2D hydroxyl of the\nNADP\n+ ribose, thus drawing the electrophilic C atom of the\nsubstrate C O group sufﬁciently close to the C4 atom of the\ncofactor for hydride exchange to occur.\nFor the structure from data set 3, once the protein, water\nand cofactor atoms had been modelled, signiﬁcant omit\ndensity persisted within the active site that could be modelled\nas the added ketone ligand 2,2-diﬂuoroacetophenone ( 15;\nFig. 2d) and not as the hydrate form observed forSrIRED\nwith 20. In the complex ofAdRedAm with15, the phenyl ring\nof the substrate is stacked against the side chain of Met176; the\ncarbonyl group of the ketone is coordinated to the phenolic\nhydroxyl of the side chain of Tyr177 at a distance of 3.0 A˚.T h e\nF atoms are again positioned 3.2 and 3.3 A˚ from the O2D atom\nof the ribose sugar, suggesting again that these interactions\nmay be signiﬁcant in permitting the reduction of the ketone by\nthe cofactor to some extent, but only in the case where F atoms\nare present. However, the electrophilic C atom is not as ideally\nplaced for hydride exchange as observed for20 in PDB entry\n5ocm, as the distance of the electrophilic C atom from the\nNADP\n+ atom is suboptimal at 4.5 A˚. In addition, the ketone\n15 presents itsre face to the cofactor, which would result in the\nexperimentally observed (S)-alcohol product. The complex\nillustrates the imperfect binding of the ﬂuorinated ketone15\nfor either amine or alcohol production, and also provides a\nbasis for understanding the stereoselectivity ofAdRedAm for\ntransformations of substrates in this series.\nAdRedAm is a useful biocatalyst for a number of imine-\nreduction and reductive amination reactions. The presented\nstructures ofAdRedAm provide new insights into conforma-\ntional dynamics in this IRED, interactions that confer superior\nstability and also the basis for steroselectivity and chemo-\nselectivity in the transformation of ﬂuorinated ketones. In\naddition to these insights, these and other structures of IREDs\nwill serve as valuable platforms for the structure-guided\nengineering of IREDs for improved process stability.\nAcknowledgements\nWe thank Dr Johan P .

However, the\nidentification of enzymes for target transformations of interest\nrequires major screening efforts. Here, we report a structure-based\ncomputational workflow to prioritize protein sequences by a score\nbased on predicted activities on substrates, thereby reducing a\nresource-intensive laboratory-based biocatalyst screening. We\nselected imine reductases (IREDs) as a class of biocatalysts to\nillustrate the application of the computational workflow termed\nIREDFisher. Validation by using published data showed that\nIREDFisher can retrieve the best enzymes and increase the hit rate\nby identifying the top 20 ranked sequences. The power of\nIREDFisher is confirmed by computationally screening 1400 sequences for chosen reductive amination reactions with different levels\nof complexity. Highly active IREDs were identified by only testing 20 samples in vitro. Our speed test shows that it only takes 90 min\nto rank 85 sequences from user input and 30 min for the established IREDFisher database containing 591 IRED sequences.\nIREDFisher is available as a user-friendly web interface (https://enzymeevolver.com/IREDFisher). IREDFisher enables the rapid\ndiscovery of IREDs for applications in synthesis and directed evolution studies, with minimal time and resource expenditure. Future\nuse of the workflow with other enzyme families could be implemented following the modification of the workflow scoring function.\nKEYWORDS: biocatalysis, enzyme screening, imine reductase, computational workflow, structural modeling\n■\nINTRODUCTION\nEnzymatic synthesis has gained growing attention in recent\nyears due to the inherent advantages of benign reaction\nconditions along with exquisite chemo-, stereo-, and regio-\nselectivity.\n1−5\nHowever, finding the optimal biocatalyst to\neffect the transformation of a substrate of interest is often\nchallenging and time consuming. There are two strategies\ncommonly used in enzyme discovery (Figure 1, left panel).\nOne is to manually select the enzymes that have been reported\nto be active toward similar substrate(s) in the literature.\nHowever, this approach restricts the diversity of accessible\nenzymes and may result in potentially active enzymes being\nmissed. Consequently, the alternative strategy of searching for\nhomologous enzymes from databases is increasingly applied.\nHowever, this approach typically generates a very large number\nof sequences, the majority of which have not been\ncharacterized experimentally.\n6,7\nScreening all of these sequen-\nces is time consuming, requiring the extensive use of analytical\nequipment and other methods for high-throughput screening.\nComputational tools have shown great power in the\ndevelopment and application of biocatalysts including\nsynthetic pathway design,\n8−10\nenzyme engineering,\n11−14\nand\nde novo design.\n15−18\nHowever, in silico pipelines that prioritize\nsequences and thus reduce the necessary screening throughput\nin the laboratory are still underdeveloped. The current\nstructure-based pipelines are either struggling in dealing with\nlarge numbers of sequences and are thus mainly used for\nengineering an initially known active enzyme\n19,20\nor require a\ndetailed description of the catalytic geometry based on a\nknown ligand-binding motif.\n21−23\nSequence-based pipe-\nlines\n24−38\ncan realize high throughput but they generally\nignore substrate variations (a key consideration in establishing\nbiocatalytic panels), leading to poor activity predictions of\nenzymes in relation to target substrates. Standalone methods\nsuch as homology modeling and molecular docking have been\nestablished over many years but are generally used individually\nrather than in automated combination, which limits\nthroughput in biocatalyst screening programs. Integration of\nthese approaches into an automated pipeline for biocatalyst\nReceived: May 19, 2023\nRevised: August 20, 2023\nPublished: September 5, 2023\nResearch Articlepubs.acs.org/acscatalysis\n© 2023 The Authors.

{"text": "discovery is urgently needed to rapidly model enzyme−\nsubstrate complexes and generate rank ordering of likely active\nsequences. Only a few structure-based computational pipe-\nlines\n38−41\nhave been published. However, none of these have\nbeen automated to enable easy access to laboratory-based\nscientists. An “easy-to-use” in silico web application is required\nfor experimentalists who need to conduct efficient and rapid\nscreens to identify active enzymes but are struggling to use\nmore specialized computational tools. Consequently, an “easy-\nto-use” in silico web-based application will streamline\nexperimental screening and thereby reduce the time and\nresources required to identify biocatalysts for use.\nHere, we report the development and experimental\nvalidation of an in silico pipeline, available also via a web\ninterface, termed IREDFisher (available for use at https://\nenzymeevolver.com/IREDFisher). IREDFisher is a structure-\nbased web server that allows computer-aided enzyme screening\nwith substrate(s) of interest and recommends a small (20\nenzyme) panel of IREDs for rapid biocatalytic exploration by\nthe user (Figure 2). We selected imine reductases (IREDs) as a\nmodel enzyme in view of their recent emergence as an enzyme\nclass of interest for the synthesis of chiral amines. Chiral\namines are prevalent motifs that feature in about 40% of\npharmaceuticals.\n42,43\nIREDs catalyze enantioselective imine\nreduction and can also perform the reductive amination of\nketones or aldehydes\n44−46\nand are thus of major interest to the\nacademic and industrial biocatalysis communities. Since their\ndiscovery in 2010,\n47\na vast number of IRED sequences have\nbeen published together with a wealth of activity data for\ndifferent substrates.\n48−58\nCurrently, IREDFisher only applies to\nIREDs as the scoring function is modified specifically for these\nenzymes.\n■\nRESULTS\nIREDFisher Workflow. Having the initial sequences and a\nsubstrate structure as inputs, the IREDFisher workflow\ncommences with sequence preprocessing, followed by\nstructural modeling. Then, the provided substrate is docked\ninto the modeled enzyme structures, while the protein−\nsubstrate complexes are scored by considering predicted\nbinding affinity and catalytic geometry in the final step (Figure\n2). Specifically, in step (1), each input sequence is aligned to\nindividual sequences in the protein data bank (PDB). The\ninput sequence that has the highest sequence identity to\nknown IREDs in the PDB is considered as a putative IRED and\nretained for the next step. In step (2), all three-dimensional\nstructures of the resulting sequences from step (1) are\ngenerated by MODELLER\n59\nfollowed by an optimization by\nthe default function in MODELLER,\n59\nwhich consists of\nspatial restraints on distance and dihedral angles obtained from\nthe target structure and CHARMM energy terms enforcing\nproper stereochemistry.\n60\nAll models are evaluated based on\nthe Ramachandran plot, and only those that have over 90% of\nthe residues in favorable/coreregions are defined as qualified\nmodels and subsequently used for substrate docking. In step\n(3), the substrate is docked into the active site of each qualified\nmodel. Various poses of the substrate in the active site of the\nenzymes are generated. In step (4), the distance between\nNADPH C4 and N atom of the imine substrate is calculated\nfor all poses. The pose with ∼4 Å is selected as the best pose to\nrealize hydride transfer in a catalytic process (see pose\nselection in Figure 2 and details in the Methods section). In\nstep (5), the number of acidic residues N\nacidic\n, basic residues\nN\nbasic\n, and histidine residues N\nHis\nare calculated and used to\nmodify the Autodock Vina\n61\nscoring function considering they\nplay important roles in the stabilization of iminium\nintermediate formation and proton transfer (see details in\nthe Methodssection). The modified scoring function Refined\nscore = 4.0 × Vina score + 1.0 × N\nacidic\n− 9.0 × N\nHis\n+ 9.0 ×\nN\nbasic\nwas used to finally rank all input sequences. The top 20\nIRED sequences are then selected for in vitro screening.\nIREDFisher Validation Using Published Screening\nData. The screening data from three established IRED panels\nwere used to test the IREDFisher workflow: Roiban et al.\npanel\n56\n(85 sequences) for substrates 1−9, France et al.\npanel\n52\n(45 sequences) for substrates 10−17, and Mont-\ngomery et al. IRED panel\n53\n(93 sequences) for 18−24 (Figure\n3). Each panel and the corresponding tested substrates were\nfed into IREDFisher to obtain the recommended 20\nsequences. As control, 20 sequences were randomly selected\nfrom each corresponding panel. Hit rates using a conversion\ncutoff of 2% (hit rate of ≥ 2% conversion) and 50% (hit rate of\n≥ 50% conversion) were calculated and compared between the\ntwo methods (Figure 4a,b and Table S1). The likelihood of\nretrieving the best hit in the 20 selected sequences using the\ntwo methods was also calculated (Figure 4c and Table S2). In\nFigure 1. Solutions of enzyme discovery for targeted substrate(s). Left: two common methods for finding hit enzymes for targeted substrate(s).\nRight: a schematic diagram of IREDFisher developed in this work. Input sequences are filtered by IREDFisher with the aid of structural modeling\nand molecular docking, which allows the user to obtain a small panel consisting of prioritized sequences.\nACS Catalysis pubs.acs.org/acscatalysis Research Article\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c02278\nACS Catal. 2023, 13, 12310−12321\n12311\nterms of “hit rate of ≥ 2% conversion”, IREDFisher is\ncomparable to random selection, whereas it outperforms the\nlatter in finding hits with conversions over 50% (Figure 4b).\nThis shows the capability of IREDFisher in finding competent\nhits for downstream optimization. Furthermore, IREDFisher\nretrieved the best hit to the top 20 sequences with a likelihood\nof 100%. By contrast, the likelihood of picking the best hit by\nrandom selection is no more than 50%. In summary, the\nIREDFisher workflow is not only able to improve the hit rate\nbut also retrieves the best enzyme(s) from the whole IRED\npanel in the top 20 selected sequences. This emphasizes the\neffectiveness of IREDFisher in finding IRED hits, reducing\nscreening efforts by 50−75%.\nExperimental Validation of Predictions Made by\nIREDFisher. Next, we challenged the IREDFisher workflow\nby aiming to select potential IRED hits for subsequent\nvalidation by experimental screening. We chose the following\nreductive amination reactions as our targets, namely, 18 and\n25−28 (Figure 5a), which represent increasingly demanding\nconversions for imine reductases. Reactions corresponding to\nproducts 18 and 25 are common starting points for screening\nIREDs, whereas products 26 and 27 are important building\nblocks in the pharmaceutical industry and proved to be\nchallenging targets in a previous IRED study.\n48\nSynthesis of 28\nis particularly challenging due to the negative charge of the\ncarboxylate group in the substrate. To date, no IREDs have\nbeen reported to accept 4-formylbenzoic acid as a substrate.\nAlso, we note that 4-formylbenzoic acid 28 is a building block\nfor drugs such as procarbazine (chemotherapy), imatinib\n(chemotherapy), mocetinostat, etinostat, tucidinostat (HDAC\nFigure 2. Flow chart of the four-step IREDFisher workflow. The input sequences are preprocessed in step (1) to remove non-IRED-homologs from\nthe screening list. The three-dimensional structures of the remaining sequences are modeled in step (2). In step (3), the structures obtained from\nstep (2) are aligned to a cofactor- and ligand-bound IRED crystal structure to locate the active site and cofactor binding site for each modeled\nstructure. NADPH is placed into individual modeled structures by taking the coordinates from the crystal structure. An intermediate imine\nstructure formed by amine and ketone substrates is then docked into the active site of each structure. In step (4), the best pose for the substrate\nwithin the enzyme is selected by the distance between two key atoms of the cofactor and substrate. In crystal structures of IREDs, this distance is\naround 4 Å. In step (5), the number of acidic residues N\nacidic\n, the number of basic residues N\nbasic\n, and the presence of histidine residues N\nhis\n= 0 or 1\nare calculated for residues within 8 Å of the substrate. Enzymes are ranked by a modified scoring function IREDFisher score = 4.0 × Vina score +\n1.0 × N\nacidic\n− 9.0 × N\nHis\n+ 9.0 × N\nbasic\n(see details described in the Methods section).\nACS Catalysis pubs.acs.org/acscatalysis Research Article\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c02278\nACS Catal. 2023, 13, 12310−12321\n12312\ninhibitors), revefenacin (COPD treatment), bavisant (ADHD\ntreatment), and fedovapagon (nocturia treatment) (Figure\nS1). Inclusion of 28 was used to explore whether the\nIREDFisher workflow could identify biocatalysts for novel\nreductive amination reactions.\nFor sequence input, we used 193 well-expressed enzymes\nfrom our in-house panel along with 33 new sequences found\nby IREDFisher that are also expressed well. To find new active\nenzymes toward selected targets, we collected uncharacterized\nIRED homologs from public databases (NCBI and UniProt)\nand IREDs from established panels (Robian et al.,\n56\nFrance et\nal.,\n52\nWetzl et al.,\n54\nand Yao et al.\n51\n), generating 1239\nsequences in total (Figure 5a, lower panel). Then, the first\nround of the IREDFisher ranking was run for the collected\nsequences based on the targeted product to prioritize\nsuccessful gene synthesis and protein expression. The top 20\nenzyme sequences for targets 18 and 25−30 were selected in\nsilico. Then, 60 sequences were identified after removing\nduplicates from which genes were synthesized and expressed in\nE. coli. This resulted in 33 enzymes (55% of selected enzymes)\nthat expressed well in E. coli, while 27 enzymes (45% of\nselected enzymes) failed in cloning and/or expression.\nWe then combined these 33 enzymes with 193 sequences\nfrom our in-house panel and ran a second round of\nFigure 3.

Reaction\noptimization was not carried out, as only the relative efficiency\nof IREDFisher under standardized conditions was being\nevaluated. For target reactions 18 and 25−28, the hit rate\ndecreases as the difficulty of the IRED reactions increases, with\n2−11 hits (over 90% conversion) of corresponding substrates\nobtained. In a previous study, the hit rate of 26 (26b in a\nprevious paper\n48\n) and 27 (23d in a previous paper\n48\n) by\nFigure 5. Validation of IREDFisher predictions in identifying hits for five chosen reactions. (a) IREDFisher was run in two rounds: in the first\nround, the sequences from external sources, public databases, and established panels were ranked by IREDFisher to prioritize those to be used for\ngene synthesis and enzyme expression. In the second round, 33 new enzymes with good expression in Escherichia coli and 193 in-house sequences\nwere ranked by IREDFisher. The top 20 enzymes for each reaction were then investigated in the laboratory. The percentages of new enzymes and\nin-house enzymes are 65 and 35% for 18, 50 and 50% for 25, 45 and 55% for 26, 50 and 50% for 27, and 55 and 45% for 28. Compounds are\nshown in product forms. Amine nucleophile components are colored in blue. (b) The conversion of IREDFisher selected sequences toward\nproducts 18 and 25−28. Hit rates for each reaction were calculated using a conversion cutoff of 2%: Hit rate =\n× 100%\nnumber of e\nnzymes ( 2 %\nconversio\nn)\n 20\n. NS indicates that this sequence is not in the top 20 selected by IREDFisher and consequently was not\ntested in vitro. Sequences labeled pIR are from the in-house panel. Sequences labeled yIRED are new uncharacterized sequences and highlighted in\nbold and italic font.\nACS Catalysis pubs.acs.org/acscatalysis Research Article\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c02278\nACS Catal. 2023, 13, 12310−12321\n12314\nscreening a panel of 384 IREDs was low (2.6% for 26 and 5.5%\nfor 27), whereas the hit rate in this study employing\nIREDFisher increased substantially to 60 and 40%, respec-\ntively. Notably, two hits, with conversion ≥ 90%, were found\nfor the challenging product 28, demonstrating that IREDFisher\ncan find enzymes that catalyze reactions of pharmaceutical\nimportance. Furthermore, by exploiting the resources from\npublic databases, highly active IREDs that have not been\nreported previously were identified and multiple enzymes (e.g.,\nyIRED10, yIRED23, yIRED25) were found to have broad\nsubstrate scope. The benefit of IREDFisher in prioritizing\nscreening is clear, in this case reducing the experimental\nscreening required from ≥ 1000 samples without IREDFisher\nvirtual screening to only 20 samples.\nIREDFisher Web Interface and Speed Test. Encouraged\nby the validation results using established screening data and\nour own experiments, our intention was to develop a user-\nfriendly workflow that can be widely used by the biocatalysis\ncommunity. To avoid any requirement for the use of personal\ncomputational/programming skills, we have built an IRED-\nFisher web server (https://enzymeevolver.com/IREDFisher)\n(Figure 6). We emphasize that the current methodology only\napplies to IREDs. For the input structure, the imine structure\nformed by the condensation of aldehyde or ketone and amine\nis required. This can be obtained by the free online structure\ndrawing tool Marvin JS (https://marvinjs-demo.chemaxon.\ncom/latest/) from ChemAxon (Figure 6a, example in the\nsquare on the right). The index of the N atom in the C�N\nbond is also required as an input, which can be generated using\nthe Marvin interface. A FASTA-formatted sequence file is\nrequired if users intend to rank their own sequences (Figure\n6a, example in the square on the left). After the job is\nsubmitted, output files such as three-dimensional structures of\nIREDs, substrate-bound complex structures, and scoring files\nare generated and added to the web page. By checking the\nsorted rescoring file, the user can obtain an optimized small\nFigure 6. Web interface of IREDFisher. (a) Job submission interface and input file examples.

The file for sequence ranking (1a_imine_sort_rescore.csv in the example) is shown.\nACS Catalysis pubs.acs.org/acscatalysis Research Article\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c02278\nACS Catal. 2023, 13, 12310−12321\n12315\nIRED screening panel with 20 recommended sequences by\nIREDFisher (Figure 6b). In addition, IREDFisher also allows\nusers to rank the sequences from established panels and public\ndatabases (see the Methods section for details). Therefore,\nIREDFisher can be employed in ranking: (i) user-defined\nsequences; (ii) established IRED panels, e.g., Robian et al.,\n56\nFrance et al.,\n52\nWetzl et al.,\n54\netc.; and (iii) IRED sequences\ncollected from the public database in this study. The speed test\nshowed that IREDFisher can perform the calculation of a user-\ndefined panel with 85 sequences in 90 min. Moreover, it only\ntakes ca 30 min to complete the ranking of the established\nIRED panels and sequences from public databases by using the\nstructures already deposited in the IREDFisher web server.\nConsequently, based on simple data input, nonspecialists in\nbioinformatics can have access to workflow outputs using only\na few mouse clicks without human interference, which makes it\napplicable for small IRED panel design.\n■\nDISCUSSION\nThe computational four-step workflow IREDFisher that aims\nto streamline the screening of enzyme panels was produced by\nintegrating sequence analysis, structure modeling, and\nmolecular docking. Although large numbers of protein\nstructures have been released recently by AlphaFold,\n62\nthe\nstructures obtained are not always applicable for the use of\nmolecular docking. For many enzymes, the substrate-binding\nsite is formed by monomers/dimers, but only monomeric\nstructures were deposited in the database. For example, most\nof the new sequences used in this study were only modeled as\nmonomer in the AlphaFold database. We have shown that the\nactive site is similar between the dimer models generated by\nhomology modeling and AlphaFold (Figure S2), while the\nformer approach saves considerable computation time (3 min\nby homology modeling versus 30 min by AlphaFold per\nstructure). This is also suggested by a previous publication.\n63\nTherefore, the template-based homology modeling is beneficial\nfor the rapid building of structures in the IREDFisher\nworkflow, allowing users to rank large numbers of sequences.\nThe workflow was applied by using a model enzyme IRED\nand subsequently validated using previously published screen-\ning data. IREDFisher demonstrated the power of retrieving the\nbest hit found simply by screening a small panel of 20\nsequences using the IREDFisher workflow. Experimental\nvalidation in which IREDFisher selects 20 enzymes from a\npool of ∼1400 sequences for 5 reactions, and with different\nlevels of product complexity, further establishes the effective-\nness of IREDFisher. IREDFisher ranks enzymes based on\nenzyme−substrate-binding interactions and does not consider\nfeatures such as the charge distribution on the protein surface,\nwhich might, for example, be important for successful protein\nexpression in E. coli. As such, poorly expressed proteins could\nrank better than proteins that are expressed well in E. coli. The\nworkflow was run initially to identify sequences for gene\nsynthesis and protein expression analysis. We then performed a\nsecond screening experiment to rank new IRED biocatalysts\nonly with those sequences that expressed well in E. coli. The\nprediction of enantioselectivity by IREDFisher is not\ninvestigated in this study because this is challenging. That\nsaid, IREDFisher narrows the search to a small panel of IREDs\nsuch that screening those biocatalysts for enantioselectivity is\nno longer an onerous task.\nIt is noteworthy that most biocatalytic processes for drug\nproduction need to go through extensive reaction optimization\nand mutagenesis approaches such as directed evolution to\nobtain a biocatalyst that fulfills the desired process require-\nments. Directed evolution relies on the screening of thousands\nof enzyme variants and usually involves several rounds of\nlibrary generation and screening, resulting in large numbers of\nvariants that require high-throughput screening (HTS)\nmethods for their evaluation. As such, screening remains the\nmajor bottleneck in biocatalysis applications, and this places\nmajor burdens on the resources and time required to generate\na suitable biocatalyst. By taking advantage of the IREDFisher\ncomputational workflow, we have shown that it is possible to\nidentify suitable biocatalysts for simple and challenging\nsubstrates. If needed, these could be evolved further to fulfill\nprocess needs with reduced screening efforts. IREDFisher is\ntherefore valuable, either as a standalone computational\nworkflow to aid the rapid identification of biocatalysts or as\na “front-end’ workflow to accelerate directed evolution\nprograms by selecting the prototype, catalytically competent\nenzyme scaffolds for a target reaction. However, we clarify that\nIREDFisher takes wild-type sequences as input, which limits its\nability to “design” enzymes with non-natural functions to\ncatalyze extremely challenging reactions.\nIREDFisher is designed as a “fast prescreen method” to rank\ninput sequences. As such, it has limitations. Protein dynamics\nand energy barrier calculations are not incorporated because\nthis would be too time consuming for a fast prescreening tool\nfor use by experimentalists. The IREDFisher scoring function\nworks as a tool to rank input sequences instead of accurately\npredicting the conversion/activity of enzymes. We trained the\nscoring instead to deliver a maximum hit rate of the top 20\nsequences because 20 screening experiments can be carried out\nin one batch with overnight incubation for rapid enzyme\nscreening. That said, the IREDFisher workflow has the power\nto find highly active hits in the 20 recommended sequences.\nThis indicates that a trade-off between speed and accuracy has\nbeen achieved to some extent. Currently, it is applicable to\nIREDs as the scoring function is designed specifically for this\nenzyme family. We have also tested IREDFisher on haloalkane\ndehydrogenases and compared our results with a previous\nstudy.\n39,40\nOnly one enzyme identified by this previous study\nwas ranked in the top 20 sequences from IREDFisher. Clearly,\ngeneric substrate inputs and associated scoring functions will\nneed to be explored to expand the utility of our workflow to\ndifferent enzyme reactions. Specifically, reactive atoms in the\nsubstrate and catalytic residues in the enzyme should be\nprovided by the user to help select the best binding pose after\ndocking. Also, deep learning methods are promising\napproaches to train a model, e.g., by taking features from\npredicted binding modes such as distances and angles between\nkey atoms, atom types, and charge distributions in the active\nsite. This challenge, together with integration into Retro-\nBiocat,\n8\nwill be implemented to enable the process from the\nbiocatalytic pathway design all the way through to the\ngeneration of small screening panels to allow for direct hit\nidentification.\nIn summary, the development and use of IREDFisher have\nreduced the size of screening panels to only 20 enzymes, with\nsignificant savings in resource and time required to perform the\nexperimental screening. For challenging substrates, where\nconversions with the wild-type enzyme may be low, the hits\nobtained could then be used as a parent sequence for\nsubsequent directed evolution approaches. The workflow\nprovides a user-friendly free web interface (https://\nACS Catalysis pubs.acs.org/acscatalysis Research Article\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c02278\nACS Catal. 2023, 13, 12310−12321\n12316\nenzymeevolver.com/IREDFisher), requiring no experience in\ncomputational chemistry or programming, which users can\nimplement with only a few “mouse clicks”. The expansion of\nthe web tool to other enzyme classes is envisaged with more\naccurate scoring functions, taking advantage of machine\nlearning and other approaches. This will assist in the\nidentification of enzymes for transformations of interest from\na plethora of continuously growing sequence data and,\ntherefore, contribute to the increasing application of\nbiocatalytic methods in the synthesis.\n■\nMETHODS\nIREDFisher Four-Step Panel Optimization Workflow.\nSequence Preprocessing. A FASTA-formatted sequence file\ngiven by the user was loaded into the workflow. Each\nindividual sequence was generated by splitting the whole\nsequences. For sequence, we searched homologous proteins in\nthe Protein Data Bank using MODELLER.\n59\nThe one with the\nhighest sequence identity was considered as the template\nprotein of the query sequence. For imine reductases, only\nsequences with characterized IREDs (PDB codes: 3ZGY,\n64\n4D3D,\n65\n4D3S,\n65\n4OQY,\n66\n4OQZ,\n66\n5A9T,\n67\n5OCM,\n68\n5OJL,\n69\n6EOD,\n44\n6JIT, 6JIZ, 6GRL, and 5G6R) as the\ntemplate proteins were retained for the next step.\nStructure Modeling. IREDs form homodimers with the\nactive site located at the interface between the monomers, thus\nmaking it more challenging to build a model in an automated\nway.\n70\nThe general sequence alignment between the template\nprotein and query sequence was calculated only for one chain.\nTo overcome this issue, the single-chain sequence alignment\nbetween each query sequence and the template protein was\nrepeated once more by an in-house script to generate a double-\nchain sequence alignment file. To automate the modeling of\nthe IRED dimeric form, a template protein needs to be\nspecified. The imine reductase from Streptosporangium roseum\n(PDB code: 5OCM\n68\n) is selected as the dimer template\nprotein given its high resolution and the clear substrate and\ncofactor NADPH binding site. Then, models are generated and\noptimized using MODELLER\n59\nbased on the modified double-\nchain sequence alignment. All models are evaluated based on\nthe Ramachandran plot, and only those that have over 90% of\nthe residues in the favorable/core region are defined as\nqualified models and subsequently are used for substrate\ndocking.\nMolecular Docking. To locate the active site easily, all\nthree-dimensional structures obtained from the last step are\naligned to the template structure 5OCM by the PyMol python\nlibrary. The cofactor NADPH is directly placed into the\ncofactor binding site of each modeled structure using the\nreference NADPH from the crystal structure prior to substrate\ndocking. The center of mass of the bound ligand 9RH in\n5OCM is used as the center of the docking box. The docking\nbox size is calculated by using script eBoxSize.pl,\n71\nconsidering\nthe gyration radius of the substrate, which improves the\ndocking accuracy.\n71\nThen, all aligned structures with the\nbound NADPH are prepared using AutoDockTools.\n72\nTo\ninput the structure of the imine form of the substrate formed\nby the condensation of amine and ketone, the three-\ndimensional coordinates are generated by Babel\n73\nand then\nprepared using AutoDockTools.\n72\nMultiple poses are gen-\nerated by Autodock vina\n61\nwith exhaustiveness value 10.\nScoring and ranking. When the IRED reaction occurs,\nNADPH transfers a hydride from atom C4 to the imine\nsubstrate.\n44,70,74\nTo obtain the most reliable pose, the distance\nbetween the C4 atom in NADPH and N in imine, the substrate\nis used as a criterion (Figure 2). Docking poses with the C4···\nN distance shorter than 3.5 Å are removed to avoid clashes.\nPoses with the C4···N distance longer than 6.0 Å are also\nremoved because it is beyond the distance range for hydride\ntransfer. The remaining poses having the closest C4···N\ndistance are selected as the best model. To improve the scoring\nfunction, we take the catalytic mechanism, proton transfer, and\nhydride transfer\n75\ninto consideration. It has been reported that\nacidic residues, basic residues, and a conserved histidine\nresidue in the active site play important roles in the\nstabilization of the key intermediate in the IRED-catalyzed\nreaction.\n75\nAccordingly, we included three terms in the scoring\nfunction: the number of acidic residues N\nacidic\n, the number of\nbasic residues N\nbasic\n, and the presence of histidine residues to\nrepresent the effect enzymes have on reactions. The final\nscoring function after the optimization of hyperparameters is\nrefined score = 4.0 × Vina score + 1.0 × N\nacidic\n− 9.0 × N\nHis\n+\n9.0 × N\nbasic\n. In this equation, N\nacidic\n/N\nbasic\nis the total number\nof acidic/basic residues in the active site and N\nHis\nis the\npresence (N\nHis\n= 1) or absence of histidine (N\nhis\n= 0) residue\nin the active site. The weights for each component of the\nscoring function were tuned by running with a range of −10 to\n10 using compounds 18−24 screened by Montgomery et al.\nIRED panel,\n53\nand the best weight was decided by the highest\npercentage of hits with conversion over 50% in the top 20 list.\nThe scoring function was tested by Roiban et al. panel\n56\nfor\nsubstrates 1−9 and France et al. panel\n52\nfor substrates 10−17.\nOnly residues within 8 angstroms of the ligand are taken into\naccount when we count the number of key residues.\nIREDFisher Structure Databases. To help users design\nan IRED screening panel from scratch by the IREDFisher\nworkflow, we collected published IRED panels: GSK panel in\n2017,\n56\nMIB panel in 2018,\n52\nMIB panel in 2020,\n53\nMIB\nmetagenomic panel in 2021,\n48\nRoche panel in 2016,\n55\nand\nPeiyuan Yao panel\n51\nin 2018. After sequence preprocessing\nstep, a total of 451 published sequences were collected\nincluding the characterized IRED sequences.\nTo make use of the public database, we conducted\nhomology search in UniProt\n6\nand NCBI reference protein\n76\ndatabases using the characterized IREDs as seed sequences.\nHomologous sequences with sequence identity over 30%,\ncoverage over 80%, and E-value under 10 compared to the\ncorresponding seed sequence were downloaded. 1028\nsequences were collected after removing duplicates, followed\nby a clustering with threshold 0.7 by cd-hit.\n77\nAfter sequence\npreprocessing, a total of 591 sequences were collected from the\npublic database.\nAll of the above sequences were modeled and prepared for\ndocking by the IREDFisher workflow. With the well-prepared\nstructure database, IREDFisher runs much faster.\n■\nEXPERIMENTAL DETAILS FOR IN VITRO\nSCREENING\nGeneral (Chemicals and Enzymes). All chemicals and\nsolvents were purchased from commercial sources such as\nAcros Organics (Geel, Belgium), Fluorochem (Hadfield,\nDerbyshire, UK), Alfa Aesar (Karlsruhe, Germany), and\nSigma-Aldrich (Poole, Dorset, UK). Chemicals were used\nwithout additional purification. GC gases were obtained from\nBOC gases (Guildford, UK), and HPLC solvents were\nobtained from Honeywell (Seelze, Germany).\nACS Catalysis pubs.acs.org/acscatalysis Research Article\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acscatal.3c02278\nACS Catal. 2023, 13, 12310−12321\n12317\nGC-MS analysis was performed using an Agilent 7890B\nSeries GC with a 5977B MS-EI detector in positive mode at a\nconstant He flow.

Products were identified by LC-MS\nand by comparing retention time with standards.\n■\nENZYME PRODUCTION AND EXPRESSION\nAll IREDs used in this study were obtained and expressed\nusing the same conditions as outlined in https://doi.org/10.\n1038/s41557-020-00606-wSupporting Section S3.\n■\nSCREENING\nEnzyme Screening for Target Product 18.

The\nreaction mixture was incubated at 37 °C with shaking at 900\nrpm (Eppendorf ThermoMixer) for 24 h. After 24 h, 250 μL\nwas recovered from the reaction mixture and quenched with 20\nμL of 10 M sodium hydroxide and extracted with 250 μL of\ndichloromethane (DCM) to extract the substrate and possible\nbyproducts. The organic phase was dried over anhydrous\nmagnesium sulfate (MgSO\n4\n). The other 250 μL was extracted\nwith 250 μL of dichloromethane (DCM) to extract the\nproduct. The two organic phases were combined, dried over\nanhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO\n4\n), and analyzed by GC-\nMS.\n■\nENZYME SCREENING FOR TARGET PRODUCT 27\nAnalytical scale reductive amination biotransformations were\ncarried out on a 500 μl scale adjusted to pH 8.0 containing 4\nmg/mL of lyophilized powder of the supernatant of lysate\nIRED, 0.5 mg/mL of GDH (Codexis CDX-901), 0.5 mM of\nNADP\n+\n(Prozomix), 40 mM of D -glucose, 5% of DMSO, 10\nmM of cycloheptanone, and 10 equivalents of propargylamine\n(1 M propargylamine stock pH 8.0 adjusted), with the reaction\nvolume made up to 500 μL in 100 mM tris buffer.

The organic phase was dried over\nanhydrous magnesium sulfate (MgSO\n4\n) and analyzed by GC-\nMS.\n■\nENZYME SCREENING FOR TARGET PRODUCT 28\nPrevious test reactions were carried on at pH 8 as IREDs\nusually exhibit higher activities on slightly basic pH. However,\nreaction test 3 was done at pH 6 since the acid is partially\ndeprotonated and the aim was to use pH values closer to\nformylbenzoic acid pKa to make it less negatively charged.\nAnalytical scale reductive amination biotransformations were\ncarried out on a 500 μL scale adjusted to pH 6.0 containing 4\nmg/mL of lyophilized powder of the supernatant of lysate\nIRED, 0.5 mg/mL of GDH (Codexis CDX-901), 0.5 mM of\nNADP\n+\n(Prozomix), 20 mM of D -glucose, 2.5% of DMSO, 5\nmM of 4-formylbenzoic acid, and 20 equivalents of cyclo-\npropylamine (1 M cyclopropylamine stock pH 6.0 adjusted),\nwith the reaction volume made up to 500 μL min of 100 mM\n2-(N-morpholino) ethanesulfonic acid (MES) buffer.

{"text": "An imine reductase that captures reactive intermediates in\nthe biosynthesis of the indolocarbazole reductasporine\nReceived for publication, September 11, 2023, and in revised form, December 21, 2023Published, Papers in Press, January 8, 2024,\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jbc.2024.105642\nPhillip Daniel-Ivad and Katherine S. Ryan*\nFrom the Department of Chemistry, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada\nReviewed by members of the JBC Editorial Board. Edited by Sarah E. O’Connor\nImine reductases (IREDs) and reductive aminases have been\nused in the synthesis of chiral amine products for drug\nmanufacturing; however, little is known about their biological\ncontexts. Here we employ structural studies and site-directed\nmutagenesis to interrogate the mechanism of the IRED RedE\nfrom the biosynthetic pathway to the indolocarbazole natural\nproduct reductasporine. Cocrystal structures with the\nsubstrate-mimic arcyriaﬂavin A reveal an extended active site\ncleft capable of binding two indolocarbazole molecules. Site-\ndirected mutagenesis of a conserved aspartate in the primary\nbinding site reveals a new role for this residue in anchoring the\nsubstrate above the NADPH cofactor. Variants targeting the\nsecondary binding site greatly reduce catalytic efﬁciency, while\naccumulating oxidized side-products. As indolocarbazole\nbiosynthetic intermediates are susceptible to spontaneous\noxidation, we propose the secondary site acts to protect against\nautooxidation, and the primary site drives catalysis through\nprecise substrate orientation and desolvation effects. The\nstructure of RedE with its extended active site can be the\nstarting point as a new scaffold for engineering IREDs and\nreductive aminases to intercept large substrates relevant to\nindustrial applications.\nImine reductases (IREDs) (1, 2) have drawn considerable\ninterest for their application as biocatalysts in the synthesis of\npharmaceuticals (3– 6). IREDs can be used in chiral amine\nsyntheses starting from imines (7, 8) or amine-ketone pairs (9).\nThey are valued for their ability to create secondary and ter-\ntiary chiral amines, as well as catalyzing reductive amination\n(6, 10). Recently, two reductive aminases (RedAms) have been\nengineered to produce industrially useful amounts of drug\ncandidates (11, 12). However, with the focus on industrial\napplications and engineering of IREDs, the study of these en-\nzymes in their natural context has been neglected.\nRedE, an IRED, serves as a biosynthetic enzyme in the for-\nmation of the indolocarbazole natural product reductasporine\n(13). Indolocarbazoles have been a rich source of potential\nchemotherapeutics with many entering clinical trials for ac-\ntivity against cancers (14), and the semisynthetic staurosporine\nderivative, midostaurin, was approved in 2017 as an anticancer\ntreatment (15). In theﬁeld of biosynthesis, a number of studies\nhave highlighted the shared features of indolocarbazole as-\nsembly, with initial steps catalyzed by a core set of oxidative\nenzymes, followed by the action of diverse tailoring enzymes\n(16). Each indolocarbazole gene cluster preserves three genes\ncoding for an FAD-dependent tryptophan oxidase (redO, rebO,\nand staO), a heme-containing chromopyrrolic acid (CPA)\nsynthase (redD, rebD, and staD) and a cytochrome P450\nindolocarbazole synthase (redP, rebP, and staP)( Fig. S1). The\ntryptophan oxidase ﬁrst converts two\nL-tryptophan molecules\nto the corresponding imines before CPA synthase couples the\ntwo imines at the Cβ position (17). The indole-3-pyruvate\nimine dimer spontaneously cyclizes into CPA (18, 19). The\nindolocarbazole synthase oxidatively bridges the indole C2\npositions yielding a proposed dicarboxy indolocarbazole in-\ntermediate (4) ( 20, 21). This indolocarbazole is prone to\ndecarboxylation and oxidation and has not yet been directly\ndetected. Several indolocarbazole biosynthetic gene clusters\nencode unique enzymes that capture and stabilize an indolo-\ncarbazole decomposition product before promoting the for-\nmation of a more stable compound for further tailoring\n(22– 26). For example, the rebeccamycin biosynthetic enzyme\nRebC and the homologous staurosporine biosynthetic enzyme\nStaC capture reactive intermediates and funnel them toward\nthe 8- and 4-electron oxidation products, respectively\n(Fig. S1B). The trapping of distinct tautomers of 7-carboxy-\nK252c in crystals of RebC and in RebC-10x, an enzyme with\nStaC-like activity, suggest that careful control of the hybridi-\nzation at the C7 position can enable simple decarboxylation in\nthe keto tautomer to staurosporine aglycone K252c (in the\ncase of StaC) or decarboxylation after hydroxylation of the\nenol tautomer to arcyriaﬂavin A (AFA) (in the case of RebC)\n(23, 25).\nThe reductasporine gene cluster was discovered while\nscreening the metagenomes of soil samples for CPA synthase-\nlike genes (13). Chang et al. reconstituted this pathway in\nEscherichia coli and proposed RedE reduces the 5,7-\ndidehydro-N,N-didemethylreductasporine ( 3) to dideme-\nthylreductasporine (2)( Fig. 1). This proposal is based on the\npropensity of the dicarboxyindolocarbazole intermediate4 to\nspontaneously decarboxylate at physiological conditions,\nalthough 3 was not detected directly (13, 20). Recently, our\ngroup reconstituted reductasporine biosynthesisin vitro (27),\nreproducing the RedE-dependent formation of2 from indo-\nlocarbazole synthase products and subsequent methylationvia\n* For correspondence: Katherine S.

In analogy to the role of the StaC/\nRebC enzymes, RedE captures a reactive intermediate from the\nindolocarbazole biosynthetic pathway; however, it catalyzes a\nreduction rather than an oxidation. Based on these biochem-\nical data, RedE would have to intercept an intermediate while\nnot allowing for oxidation, indicating a novel mechanism.\nHere, we present crystal structures of RedE, including apo,\nNADP\n+-bound and two ternary complexes with AFA and\nNADP(H). These crystal structures reveal an unexpected\nsecondary indolocarbazole binding site adjoined to the primary\nactive site, and site-directed mutagenesis shows both are\ncritical for catalysis. Our biochemical characterization of StaP\nreaction products reveals the accumulation and decomposition\nof 3, and we propose that RedE intercepts and reduces3 from\nsolution. The secondary active site may protect the indolo-\ncarbazole from oxidation and select for the catalytically\ncompatible isoindole tautomer before direct transfer to the\nprimary site for reduction. Close inspection of the secondary\nindolocarbazole binding site and comparison to other struc-\nturally characterized IREDs suggest potential sequence de-\nterminants that would favor the formation of this cleft,\nindicating wider implications on the malleability of IRED\nactive sites.\nResults\nRedE crystal diffraction dataset phasing, twinning, and initial\nmodel building\nWe solved the apo, binary complex and two ternary com-\nplex structures of RedE with NADP\n+ and AFA to resolutions\nof 1.60 to 1.63 Å (Table 1, Fig. 2). The diffraction dataset\nphases for these models were solvedvia molecular replace-\nment using a selenomethionine-substituted RedE model\n(SeMet-RedE), which was itself phasedvia single anomalous\ndispersion of selenium atoms. Twinning was detected in\nSeMet-RedE and apo-RedE crystal datasets. The second\nmoment of intensity (CI\n2D/CID2) reaches 1.78 (untwinned: 2.0,\nperfect twin: 1.5) and average local intensity differences,C|L|D,\n0.43 (untwinned: 0.5, perfect twin: 0.375). The L-test for\ntwinning identiﬁes a twin fraction as high as 23%. When a\nmonoclinic unit cell fulﬁlls any condition β ≈ 90/C14,a ≈ c, or\n2c⋅cos β ≈− a it is possible to form a pseudomerohedral twin\n(28– 30). The cell dimensions of the P 21 space group crystals\nof SeMet-RedE and apo-RedE meet the third condition, and a\nmodel can be solved for using the appropriate twin law\n(h, −k, −h−l). The resulting SeMet-RedE model arranges as a\npair of dimers in the asymmetric unit. In several chains,α11\n(residues 256– 278) has too poor electron density to model\ncompletely, and another 16 residues in several loop regions are\nalso missing (Fig. S2). Nonetheless, this model is sufﬁcient to\nsolve for phases via molecular replacement in other RedE\ndiffraction datasets. RedE cocrystals with NADP\n+ and AFA\nwere not affected by twinning.\nStructure of RedE\nRedE resembles the canonical IRED fold with an N-terminal\nNADPH-binding Rossmann domain and a C-terminal helical\nbundle mediating homodimerization (8– 10, 31). The N-ter-\nminal Rossmann domain (residues 2– 161) consists of an eight-\nstranded β-sheet with the ﬁrst six strands ( β1-6) running\nparallel and the following two strands (β7-8) antiparallel. Each\nparallel strand is bounded by anα helix (α1-7) forming βαβ\nmotifs and a 3\n10-helix forms in the loop between the anti-\nparallel β6 and β7 strands (Fig. 2A). The common Rossmann\ndomain GxGxxG nucleotide binding motif is preserved at\nresidues 9 to 14 (GLGPMG) (32). The C-terminal domain\n(residues 193– 288) is a ﬁve-membered helical bundle where\nthe latter fourα-helices (α9-12) wrap around the interdomain\nhelix of its dimer partner (αʹ8) forming an extensive 4020 Å\n2\ninterface (27% of total monomer surface area) between both\nN- and C-terminal domains as calculated by PISA software\n(33). A total of 22 and 79 residues are involved in polar and\nhydrophobic contacts, respectively (Fig. 2B). The majority of\nthese interactions are within the dimerization domains with\nonly 17 residues interfacing between N- and C-terminal do-\nmains. Hydrogen bonding and electrostatic interactions occur\nbetween E153 to Rʹ209, D160 to Gʹ195, and T121 and S123 to\nEʹ234. The N-terminal end ofα6 is associated with an iodide\nion which is in turn stabilized by Rʹ254. The majority of the\nhydrophobic contacts between the two domains are found\nFigure 1.

The simplest substrate for RedE is 5,7-didehydro-N,N-\ndidemethylreductasporine (3), which is proposed to be reduced to didemethylreductasporine (2) before methylation to1 via SAM-dependent methyl-\ntransferase, RedM.

Comparison of the apo and\nbinary structures show that R33 moves out of the adenine\nbinding area in order to stack against the purine ring while\nforming a salt bridge to the nearby 2ʹ-phosphate.\nAs the substrate and products of RedE are transiently stable,\nwe elected to use AFA as a mimic, because it shares the planar\nindolocarbazole core of3. Processing diffraction data of RedE\ncrystallized from solutions with 1.2 mM AFA and 10 mM\nNADP\n+ show electron density consistent with both AFA and\nNADP+ in each protomer (Fig. S3, A and B). In this structure,\nthe positioning of NADP+ is similar to that observed in the\nbinary complex. AFA sits above thesi-face of the nicotinamide\nC4 with the maleimide carbonyl situated 3 Å away in a ge-\nometry ideal for hydride transfer.

AFA makes hydrophobic\ncontacts with G94, S95, P96, I246, A250, and L253, and the\nG94 peptide carbonyl is held in place with a hydrogen bond to\nthe S165 side chain. An iodide ion bounded by the positive\ndipole N-terminal end of α4 and R254 completes the outer\nboundary of the cleft. Despite not including NADP\n+ in the\npreparation of these crystals, electron density is consistent\nwith the presence of NADP(H) cofactor retained during pu-\nriﬁcation. The electron density has poorer deﬁnition than that\nof the RedE-NADP\n+ or RedE-NADP+-AFA structures and can\nbe modeled by partial occupancy of an NADP + cofactor\n(Fig. S3A). Additionally, there is sparse electron density above\nthe nicotinamide moiety resembling partial occupancy of AFA\nin the same pose as characterized in the RedE-NADP+-AFA\nternary structure (Fig. S3B). The density is a poor ﬁt, and\nmodeling either AFA or water in this area produces similar\nR\nfree values. Furthermore, placing an AFA molecule in the\nactive site clashes with the clearly deﬁned position of the AFA\nmolecule in the secondary binding cleft. Placing both indolo-\ncarbazoles in the active site simultaneously forces a contact\nbetween indole rings of less than 2 Å, which is too small to\nrepresent simultaneous binding. Modeling this relation as\nalternate conformations results in occupancy of 55 to 60% in\nthe distal cleft. This feature may result from heterogeneity in\nbinding conﬁgurations throughout the crystal.\nResemblance to other NAD(P)H-dependent reductases\nSecondary structure searching via PDBeFOLD (34) shows\nRedE’s closest structural matches are other IREDs and\nRedAms (Fig. S4). These are deﬁned by the reciprocal domain\nswapping of each monomer ’s C-terminal helical bundle.\nHowever, compared to all other IREDs and RedAms RedE has\na pronounced crescent shape imparted by the secondary\nindolocarbazole binding cleft formed between αʹ10 of the\ndimerization domain and α6 of the Rossmann domain. In\nother IREDs this is a tighter binding interface between pro-\ntomers, yet buried surface area calculations indicate similar\ncontact areas between 3900 and 4600 Å\n2 (4020 Å2 in RedE).\nThe loss of close contacts betweenαʹ10 and α6 in RedE are\nsupplemented with dimer interactions found at the loop be-\ntween α8 andα9 set against the N-terminal ends ofαʹ6 andαʹ8\nof its dimer partner in addition to closer interactions between\nthe β-sheet in the Rossmann domain andαʹ9 in the dimer-\nization domain. This extra surface area may provide support to\nmaintain the separation between the domains.\nFigure 2.

{"text": "The next closest structural matches are from theβ-hydroxy\nacid dehydrogenase ( βHAD) family, which include 3-\nhydroxyisobutyrate dehydrogenase (35), L-serine dehydroge-\nnase (36) among several other characterized enzymes (Fig. S4)\n(37, 38). These share an N-terminal Rossmann NAD(P)H\nbinding domain and a C-terminal helical bundle mediating\ndimerization; however, a sharp turn in the helix following the\ninterdomain helix (α9 in RedE) redirects the chain back toward\nthe Rossmann domain resulting in no reciprocal domain\nswapping (35). Despite this large deviation, the backbone\ntraces of the overall quaternary structure of the dimer is\nmaintained between IREDs and βHADs. The related 6-\nphosphogluconate dehydrogenases shares a similar fold to\nβHADs, where the helical bundle of a 6-phosphogluconate\ndehydrogenases protomer has a circa 130 amino acid C-ter-\nminal extension which replicates the fold of an interacting\nβHAD dimer (39).\nRedE has sparing, but notable, structural similarity with\npyrroline-5-carboxylate reductases (40) and prephenate de-\nhydrogenases (Fig. S4)( 41).

Searching\nthe Protein Data Bank (PDB) for all IREDs and RedAms shows\nthat this is an unique feature to RedE and is an apparent\ninsertion of four residues (194-PGGN-197).AtRedAm has a\ntwo residue insertion in this loop; however, the area does not\ninteract with the neighbouring Rossmann domain ( 42).\nExtending the search to primary sequence matches in the\nUniProt database shows that this“PGGN” loop is found in ten\nother IRED-like enzymes, though the insertion may be more\naccurately described as residues 193-GPGG-196 (Fig. 4B). This\nloop interacts closely with P96, V97, D160, A162, and M163 in\nthe Rossmann domain where P96 and D160 are conserved\npositions among structurally characterized IREDs (Fig. S5).\nAmong more closely related sequences to RedE, the V97\nFigure 3.

Among\nstructurally characterized IREDs and RedAms a histidine or\nasparagine is often found at I246 in RedE and is involved in\ncross-domain contacts (Fig. 4B). This position is exclusively\nfound as a hydrophobic residue in other IRED-like sequences\nwith a“GPGG” insertion betweenα8 andα9.\nDetection of new StaP indolocarbazole products\nPrevious characterization of StaP reaction products assayed\nmixtures after 3 h (22), and given the known propensity for these\ncompounds to decompose quickly, we surmised we mayﬁnd\nnew compounds produced closer to the start of the reaction. We\nused an one-pot reaction where the RedE substrate is createdin\nsitu from CPA by the indolocarbazole synthase StaP withSyn-\nechococcus elongatuselectron transport coenzymes ferredoxin\n(FDX) and ferredoxin reductase (FDR) (22, 44). Production of\nreductasporine and StaP products, K252c (5, staurosporine\naglycone), 7-hydroxy-K252c (6), and AFA are veriﬁed via high-\nresolution mass and UV-visual absorbance spectra (Table S2).\nEach indolocarbazole has a diagnostic UV-visual absorbance\nspectrum with λ\nmax ≈ 290 to 300 nm ( 13, 45, 46). After\nquenching these reactions with acetonitrile at 0, 4, 8, 15, 30, and\n160 min we see the accumulation and depletion of a new com-\npound with mass consistent with3 ([M + H]\n+ = 296.11825 m/z,\n0.10 ppm), the proposed RedE substrate (Fig. S6A). Supple-\nmenting reactions with 1 mg/ml catalase in an effort to reduce\nnonspeciﬁc oxidation due to hydrogen peroxide released during\nincomplete turnover of the StaP cofactor system does not alter\nthe compound’s accumulation or lifespan (Fig. S6B). This new\ncompound is accompanied by the detection of two additional,\nlow abundance indolocarbazole compounds with molecular\nformulas attributable to 6,7-didehydro-K252c ([M + H]\n+ =\n310.09755 m/z, 0.19 ppm) and 7-carboxy-6,7-didehydro-K252c\n([M + H]\n+ = 354.08724 m/z, 0.25 ppm) (Fig. S7). Including active\nRedE and RedM under these reaction conditions shows the\nadditional accumulation of a compound consistent with methyl-\n3 ([M + H]\n+ = 310.13397 m/z, 0.32 ppm). Mixtures without\nactive RedE do not accumulate this compound, though accu-\nmulation of3 is increased (Fig. S7).\nSingle residue mutations in RedE\nBased on the ternary cocrystal structures of RedE and\nsequence alignments, nine single residue variants were\ngenerated to investigate the potential role of each binding site\nfor catalytic activity in tandem reactions including StaP,\nS. elongatusFDX, FDR and RedM (Fig. 5).

{"text": "solution. In the primary site, the D168A variant targets the\nposition often found to be sensitive to mutation in many\nIREDs andβHADs (31). The role of the residue at this position\nis not fully understood, and mutation can eliminate or reduce\ncatalytic activity or alter stereoselectivity. The D168A variant\ndoes not accumulate methyl-3 or reductasporine, suggesting a\ncritical role for this residue. Next, we sought to make mutants\nthat would perturb the hydrophobic lining of the primary site.\nL239 presses directly on the maleimide ring of AFA forcing it\nto pack closely to the nicotinamide ring of the cofactor, while\nthe more distant M175 packs with L172, Wʹ210, Fʹ217, and\nFʹ235 and together form half of the active site pocket. Assays of\nthe L239A variant result in reduced reductasporine formation,\nwhereas M175A has activity similar to the WT RedE. Lastly,\nresidue R242 hovers above the active site near the maleimide\nring of AFA and may participate in substrate recognition. It is\nalso a rare large residue toﬁnd in this position (Fig. 4B) and\nmay act to prevent a closeﬁt between domains. However, the\nR242A variant has identical activity to WT RedE.\nIn the secondary site, H249 is positioned to hydrogen bond\nwith indolocarbazole substrates and may stabilize3 via its pyr-\nrolic nitrogen or may interact with a carboxy group of a\ncarboxylated precursor (such as 4). The H249A variant has\nmarkedly reduced reductasporine accumulation, and no\nmethyl-3 is observed. The A250L variant has normal reduc-\ntasporine production; however, the production of methyl-3 is\neliminated. Observing these variants on short time scales in the\nabsence of RedM shows the pronounced accumulation of [M +\nH]\n+ ions attributable to 6,7-didehydro-K252c and 7-carboxy-\n6,7-didehydro-K252c (Fig. S8). Together these indicate that the\nsecondary binding site plays a role in theﬂux of indolocarbazole\ncompounds through the biosynthetic pathway. Sequence anal-\nysis of IREDs found in the PDB and enzymes most similar to\nRedE suggest there are several residues involved in domain-\ndomain contacts that are not preserved in RedE. For example,\nIREDs will often have a glutamate or aspartate in place of L253 in\nRedE and a histidine or asparagine in place of I246, which\ninteract with residues of the nearbyα6 helix and loop of the\nRossmann domain. However, replacing these residues in RedE,\nas in variants L253E and I246H, results in no change from WT\nactivity. Lastly, R254 forms the back wall of the secondary\nbinding cleft and interacts with the unique PGGN loop. We\nhypothesized that changes to this residue could destabilize the\nloop and widen the secondary site, but RedE-R254A mutants\nbehave similarly to the WT enzyme.\nDiscussion\nStructures of RedE bound with the substrate mimic AFA\nunambiguously show two indolocarbazole binding sites. The\nprimary binding site positions the C5 atom immediately above\nthe nicotinamide ring of the NADPH cofactor for hydride\ntransfer, and the secondary binding site places the indolo-\ncarbazole in an adjoining cleft formed between the dimeriza-\ntion domain and Rossmann domain. No secondary binding site\nhas been described among other IREDs and RedAms; however,\na Pseudomonas putida putative oxidoreductase with structure\ncoordinates deposited in the PDB (PDB: 3L6D, 24% identity)\nfeatures a similar cleft separating these domains. Given that\nthis unique structural feature is important to catalysis in RedE\nas determined by mutations, we sought out structural and\nsequence features distinguishing RedE from other IREDs and\nRedAms which may be involved in the creation of this cleft.\nWith the increased publication of IRED structures over the\npast ten years, it has become well-established that the Ross-\nmann domain rotates relative to the dimerization domain into\ndistinct open and closed conformations with at least seven\nIRED and RedAm enzymes captured in either state ( 42,\n47– 52). These domain movements are often seen when\ncomparing apo structures to binary or ternary complexes.\nFigure 5.

(2024) 300(2) 105642 7\nSuperposing open and closed conformation protomers onto\nRedE shows that RedE resembles an exaggerated open\nconformation, with all atom RMSD values on average 0.3 Å\nlower for open conformations as to closed conformations.\nRedE shows no conformational changes upon cofactor or\nligand binding, aside from the reorganization of the loop after\nβ2 upon NADP\n+ binding positioning R33 to interact with the\nadenine ring and 2 ʹ-phosphate of the cofactor. Given the\nternary complexes of RedE have little to no room for the\nRossmann domain to move toward the dimerization domain\ndue to the tightly packed AFA in each binding site, the\nstructure of RedE may represent a maximally closed confor-\nmation despite resemblance to other IRED open conforma-\ntions. The open to closed transition in these other IREDs hinge\nat the N-terminal end of the interdomain helix (RedE:α8) just\nbelow the contact point betweenα6 and αʹ10. A prominent\ndomain-domain bridging interaction is often found here as a\nglutamate residue at position 250 or 253 (RedE numbering)\nwhose side chain associates with the N-terminal dipole\nmoment ofα6 while hydrogen bonding (8, 10, 47– 50, 53– 57),\nor as a salt bridge between an arginine fromαʹ8 to an aspartate\nor glutamate on helix α6( 51, 52). RedE does not preserve\neither contact point, instead P194 and G195 from the“PGGN”\ninsertion loop connecting αʹ8t o αʹ9( Fig. 4) extends out to\nresidues P96, V97, and R100 ofα6, and D160, A162, M163,\nand V166 of the N-terminal ofα8. This is the only interdomain\ncontact to α6 aside from Rʹ254 in αʹ10 via an iodide ion\nassociated with the helix’s N-terminal positive dipole moment.\nRemoving this interaction in the R254A variant leaves RedE\nwith WT activity levels and likely does not play a signiﬁcant\nrole in stabilizing the enzyme’s structure. The second series of\ncontacts between domains of IRED and RedAm enzymes occur\nbetween αʹ9 and β6-8, which are largely hydrophobic. Many\nenzymes have a series of large and medium sized residues\narranged at this interface, such as tryptophan, phenylalanine,\ntyrosine, and histidine (8, 9, 47– 49, 51– 53, 55, 57). Other IRED\nand RedAm enzymes which do not have large residues at these\nsites do not have intimate interdomain contacts betweenαʹ9\nand theβ-sheet of the Rossmann domain, and the majority of\ndomain-domain interactions occur atαʹ10 (10, 42, 50, 56, 58,\n59). RedE has a series of small residues inαʹ9 (A202, V206, and\nT213) which interlock with β-sheet residues (L131, L133,\nM155, and L157), resulting in a tight interdomain interface.\nThe combination of loose interactions betweenαʹ10 and α6\nalongside a tight interface betweenαʹ9 andβ6-8 results in the\nRossmann domain being pulled down towardαʹ9 and away\nfrom αʹ10 relative to other IREDs, creating the exaggerated\nopen conformation and secondary indolocarbazole binding\ncleft.\nThe IRED-like enzyme fromP. putidaKT2440 (PDB: 3L6D)\nhas a similar interdomain cleft between helicesαʹ10 and α6.\nWe ﬁnd a similar domain-domain contact pattern as RedE\nwith loose to no direct connections betweenαʹ10 andα6, and a\ntight interface betweenαʹ9 and β6-8 with mainly small inter-\nlocking residues. Notably, the N-terminal of the interdomain\nhelix tucks W169 underneathα6, imparting a large rotation to\nthe Rossmann domain away from the interdomain helix\nrelative to RedE. Also,αʹ9 adopts a kink not seen in other IRED\nstructures between residues 214 to 218 allowing the relatively\nlarge F217 to pack parallel to the Rossmann domain B-sheet\nrather than push against it.\nIn IRED and RedAm enzymes an active site aspartate or\ntyrosine is typically found to be essential for catalysis (31).\nβHAD enzymes are found to use lysine residues at this posi-\ntion in order to catalyze ketone reductions. RedE maintains\nthis active site aspartate (D168); however, it is solely used to\nanchor the indolocarbazole substrate in the primary active site\nvia hydrogen bonding to the two indole N-H moieties. In-\nspection of the active site reveals there are no candidates for a\ncatalytic base in RedE, with the only protic residue within a 5 Å\nsphere of the AFA maleimide group being R242, an unlikely\nproton donor. Furthermore, the R242A mutant has no impact\non enzymatic reaction products. Additionally, StaP is capable\nof producing an unstable product consistent with3, the pro-\nposed isoindole substrate for RedE. Isoindole readily tauto-\nmerizes in solution despite its 10π electron aromatic ring\nsystem (60). The planar, aromatic 2H-isoindole tautomer\ndominates in polar aprotic solvents, whereas the imine 1H-\nisoindole tautomer dominates in nonpolar or protic solvents\n(60, 61). Therefore, if the 26π electron system of3 acts anal-\nogously to isoindole, the imine form should dominate in the\nprimary active site either due to water exposed isoindole ni-\ntrogen or preequilibration to the imine form from solution or\nsecondary binding site. Without a dedicated catalytic base and\nwith the reactive imine form of the substrate potentially\nfavored in solution the subsequent reduction via NADPH\nappears to be catalyzed in RedE by simple substrate orientation\nand desolvation effects. When the close packing of the primary\nsite around the isoindole nitrogen is disturbed, as in L239A,\nthe overall production of products is greatly reduced. This may\nbe due to the increased mobility of the indolocarbazole and\nconsequent loss in precision alignment of the substrate for\nefﬁcient hydride transfer.\nThe unexpected distal secondary indolocarbazole binding\nsite formed at the gap between the C-terminal helical dimer-\nization domain and N-terminal Rossmann domain implies a\nmechanism for unstable substrate management. Compound3\nis found to be unstable, mostly disappearing after 2 hin vitro\n(Fig. S6). This is consistent with other isoindole compounds\nthat are known to oxidize readily when exposed to aerated\nsolutions (61) and form compounds analogous to known StaP\noxidation products ( 20). The secondary binding site may\nsequester indolocarbazole substrate from solution, protecting\nit from autooxidation and enabling subsequent reduction.\nDisruption of the secondary site asserts that the site is essential\nto efﬁcient catalysis with mutants H249A and A250L resulting\nin losses in activity and accumulation of off-pathway indolo-\ncarbazole products. By the structure, A250L sterically excludes\nindolocarbazoles from binding, whereas the effect of the\nH249A mutation is less trivial to explain. H249 could play a\nrole in substrate recognition where it would hydrogen bond to\nthe isoindole nitrogen locking the substrate into place within\nthe secondary site. This hydrogen bond may act as a pseudo N-\nsubstitution lessening the nucleophilic character at C5 and C7\nStructure of reductasporine biosynthetic enzyme RedE\n8 J. Biol. Chem.

{"text": "as seen in the more stable N-substituted isoindole molecules,\nwhich tend to favor the planar, aromatic tautomer (60, 61).\nAlternatively, H249 may play an active role in selecting for the\nparticular imine tautomer that lines up with the NADPH\ncofactor for reduction (Fig. S9). This implies a direct transfer\nof the imine substrate from the secondary site to the primary\nsite. Such a transfer could be guided by D168, as an indole\nnitrogen is available for hydrogen bonding from the secondary\nsite to D168 if the side chain rotates and displaces the nearby\nwater molecule (Fig. 3B). With this hydrogen bond in place the\nside chain can swing back down and guide the indolocarbazole\nfrom the secondary site to the primary site. These ideas of\nsubstrate protection and tautomer selection determining the\nﬂux of indolocarbazole products down a productive biosyn-\nthetic route mirrors the proposed mechanisms distinguishing\nRebC and StaC activity in the generation of the aglycone cores\nof rebeccamycin and staurosporine, respectively (22, 23, 25).\nRebC and the StaC-like RebC mutant, RebC-10x, were each\ncrystallized with 7-carboxy-K252c in their active sites, but in\nalternate tautomeric forms (23, 25). RebC traps the enol form\nrequiring decarboxylation-oxidation in order to form AFA\n(23), whereas RebC-10x traps the keto form, making the\ncarboxylate group available for decarboxylation directly to\nK252c, the staurosporine aglycone (Fig. S1B)( 25). The sec-\nondary active site we report here for RedE represents a novel\napproach to the similar issue of handling short-lived substrates\nin indolocarbazole biosynthesis.\nOver the past ten years IREDs and RedAms have drawn\nincreased attention over their potential application to the\nsynthesis of chiral amine products for use in drug\nmanufacturing (3– 6). RedAm substrate scopes have previously\nbeen limited to combinations of small ketone/amine mole-\ncules, with recent efforts directed at identifying and engi-\nneering enzymes capable of accommodating larger molecules\n(50, 51, 57, 62, 63). Tantalizingly, the RedE structure shows\nthat the combined indolocarbazole binding cleft is some 24 Å\nwide providing ample space for engineering efforts toward\neffecting arbitrary reductive aminations. Alternatively, RedE\nmay be used to identify the sequence determinants of an\nextended binding cleft in order to create them in proven\nRedAms for expanded substrate scope.\nIn summary, we report the structure of the reductasporine\nbiosynthetic IRED RedE cocrystallized with AFA revealing an\nunprecedented extended active site cleft capable of binding\ntwo indolocarbazole molecules. The structure of and site-\ndirected mutagenesis in the primary binding site suggests\nreduction is catalyzed via precise substrate orientation and\ndesolvation effects, and the secondary binding site may serve\nto capture and protect indolocarbazole substrates from spon-\ntaneous oxidation. This secondary site may even select for the\nimine tautomer readily reduced in the primary site when\ntransferring directly from secondary to primary active site.\nApproaching IREDs from their context in biosynthesis can\nserve us unique insight into the familyvia unique structural\nvariations and natural substrate scope, and RedE provides a\npromising new protein scaffold for reference in iterative\nengineering.\nExperimental procedures\nGeneral methods\nPrimers were synthesized by Integrated DNA Technologies.\nQ5 DNA polymerase, T4 DNA ligase, and restriction endo-\nnucleases were purchased from New England Biolabs.

Data sets were integrated\nusing iMOSFLM ( https://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/mosﬂm/\nmosﬂm/)( 65) or XDS ( https://xds.mr.mpg.de/)( 66) and\nmerged in AIMLESS (67). Selenomethionine structures were\nphased via single anomalous dispersion of selenium and iodine\natoms via the Autosol tool in the Phenix (68) software package\n(https://phenix-online.org/). The single-wavelength anoma-\nlous diffraction phasing results were then input into Autobuild\n(69) for initial model building followed by several rounds of\nmanual inspection and building in COOT (https://www2.mrc-\nlmb.cam.ac.uk/personal/pemsley/coot/)( 70) and re ﬁnement\nvia phenix.reﬁne (71). Native protein datasets were processed\nsimilarly with phases solved for via molecular replacement\nusing the SeMet-RedE model through PHASER-MR (https://\nwww.phaser.cimr.cam.ac.uk/)( 72). Ligand restraints for AFA\nwere generated using eLBOW (73).\nSite-directed mutagenesis of RedE\nPrimers were designed so that the overlap region con-\ntaining the mutation had a T\nm /C2455 /C14C and the nonover-\nlapping region had a T m about 7 /C14C higher (calculated\nagainst the complementary DNA strand) ( 74). Where\npossible mutations were included that removed or added\nrestriction sites for preliminary screening via digests. Stan-\ndard PCR was carried out using an annealing step set to the\nhigher T\nm and ended with a 10 min elongation step. The\nPCR product mixture was incubated with DpnI before\ntransforming the digest solution as described previously into\nE. coli DH5α. Puriﬁed plasmids were screened for restriction\nfragment polymorphism and mutations con ﬁrmed by\nsequencing.\nCloning and expression of rebO and rebD, and production of\nCPA\nGenes rebO and rebD were ampliﬁed from genomic DNA\n(Lechevalieria aerocolonigenes DSM 44217), and ligated into\npET28a and pET22b, respectively. These plasmids were\ntransformed into chemically competent E. coli BL21 (DE3)\ncells and used to prepare CPA according to the previously\npublished procedure (17).\nExpression and puriﬁcation of StaP, FDX, and FDR\nPlasmid pET28a-staP was kindly provided by Catherine\nDrennan (Massachusetts Institute of Technology), and plas-\nmids pET28a-fdr and pET28a-fdx coding for S. elongatus\nPCC 7942 ferredoxin-NADP oxidoreductase (FDR) and FDX\nI, respectively, were received from Dr Hai-Yan He (Institute\nof Medicinal Biotechnology, Chinese Academy of Medical\nSciences).\nE. coli BL21(DE3) transformed with pET28a-staP, pET28a-\nfdr or pET28a-fdx were grown in LB medium with kanamycin\n(50 μg/ml) to an A\n600 of 0.5 before cooling to 16 /C14C over\n30 min. Each culture was then supplemented with 100μM\nIPTG and cells with plasmids coding for heme proteins (StaP\nand FDX) were further supplemented with 1 mMδ-amino-\nlevulinic acid before incubating for 18 h.\nMedia were removed by centrifugation (4\n/C14C, 10 min,\n3000g), and cells resuspended in 50 mM Tris (pH 8), 500 mM\nNaCl, and 5 mM imidazole. The bacterial suspension was lysed\nvia sonication (25% amplitude, cycles of 4 s on and 8 s off for\n6 min), and cell debris cleared via centrifugation (45 min,\n15,000g). Supernatant was passed through a Ni-afﬁnity column\nand enzyme harvested over an imidazole step gradient\n(5– 300 mM). Fractions containing recombinant enzyme were\ndialyzed to remove excess imidazole and salt before screening\nfor activity against CPA followed by adding glycerol to 10%\n(v/v) and storing at−70\n/C14C.\nStructure of reductasporine biosynthetic enzyme RedE\n10 J.

Metagenome mining is a valuable and efficient way to discover novel enzymes with unique properties for \nbiotechnological applications. Here, we report the discovery and biocatalytic characterization of six novel metagenomic opine \ndehydrogenases from a hot spring environment (mODHs) (EC 1.5.1.X). These enzymes catalyze the asymmetric reductive \namination between an amino acid and a keto acid resulting in opines which have defined biochemical roles and represent \npromising building blocks for pharmaceutical applications. The newly identified enzymes exhibit unique substrate specificity \nand higher thermostability compared to known examples. The feature that they preferably utilize negatively charged polar \namino acids is so far unprecedented for opine dehydrogenases. We have identified two spatially correlated positions in their \nactive sites that govern this substrate specificity and demonstrated a switch of substrate preference by site-directed mutagen-\nesis. While they still suffer from a relatively narrow substrate scope, their enhanced thermostability and the orthogonality of \ntheir substrate preference make them a valuable addition to the toolbox of enzymes for reductive aminations. Importantly, \nenzymatic reductive aminations with highly polar amines are very rare in the literature. Thus, the preparative-scale enzy -\nmatic production, purification, and characterization of three highly functionalized chiral secondary amines lend a special \nsignificance to our work in filling this gap.\nKey points\n• Six new opine dehydrogenases have been discovered from a hot spring metagenome\n• The newly identified enzymes display a unique substrate scope\n• Substrate specificity is governed by two correlated active-site residues\nKeywords Opine dehydrogenases · Reductive amination · Biocatalysis · Metagenome mining\nIntroduction\nImine reducing enzymes produce a chiral amine often with \nexcellent stereoselectivity. Therefore, there is a constant \ninterest towards them in the pharmaceutical industry. This \ninterest is driven by the high number of active pharmaceu-\ntical ingredients (APIs) bearing a chiral amine moiety as \nillustrated among the FDA-approved small molecule drugs \nbetween 2015 and 2020 (Bhutani et al. 2021). Key chiral \namine intermediates of these APIs are often produced enzy-\nmatically using transaminases (TAs) (Gomm and O’Reilly \n2018), amine dehydrogenases (AmDHs), imine reductases \n(IREDs), or monoamine oxidases (MAOs) (Sharma et al. \n2017; Cosgrove et al. 2018; Patil et al. 2018). These enzymes \nresult in chiral primary amines (TAs, AmDHs), perform \n * Gábor Tasnádi \n gabor.tasnadi@servier.com\n * Beáta G.

The applications \nof RedAms are expanding ever since (Schober et al. 2019), \nbut their substrate scope is still limited to aliphatic or smaller \naromatic amines, while reactions with more functionalized \npolar amines are lagging behind.\nOpine dehydrogenases (ODHs) represent a unique and \nyet largely underexplored class in this rapidly expanding \nlandscape of biocatalysts for reductive amination (Telek \net al. 2023 ). They catalyze the coupling of α-ketoacids \nwith α-amino acids yielding a variety of opine products. \nThese molecules have diverse structures and physiological \nroles, and different organisms evolved specialized ODHs \nfor their synthesis (Kato and Asano 2002; Harcet et al. \n2013; McFarlane and Lamb 2020; Matveeva and Otten \n2021). Despite the large evolutionary distance and low \napparent sequence similarity among these ODHs, they \nshare general structural and catalytic features (Sharma \net al. 2017), while their substrate and cofactor prefer -\nence can vary significantly. The fact that they are able to \nperform reductive amination with close to stoichiometric \nketoacid/amino acid ratio makes them promising pros-\npects to be utilized as industrial biocatalysts. Considering \nthat their natural substrates are chemically very different \nfrom the typical imine reductase or reductive aminase \nsubstrates, they can fill in a valuable complementary role \nnext to those classes. Highly functionalized polar sec-\nondary amines (such as opine derivatives) are potential \nbuilding blocks of bioactive compounds such as pepti-\ndomimetics (Li Petri et al. 2022). Their stereoselective \nsynthesis by ODHs can be easily envisaged. However, this \npotential of ODHs is largely unexploited probably due to \nthe significant difference between their native substrates \nand the potential target substrates (Ducrot et al. 2021) as \nwell as their zwitterionic and highly polar nature. The \nonly example of their utilization as biocatalysts is the \nODH from Arthrobacter sp. 1C (ArODH), which was \ndiscovered by Asano et al. (1989) and used for the syn-\nthesis of secondary amine dicarboxylic acids with apolar \nsidechains (Kato et al. 1996). A decade later, Codexis \nengineered this enzyme to accept substrates resembling \nthe classic imine reductase substrates like cyclohexanone \nor n-butylamine. This work—that was only disclosed in \na patent (Chen et al. 2013)—also shows that ODHs have \nto undergo significant engineering to accept substrates \nlargely deviating from their natural ones. However, pro-\ntein engineering towards structurally similar analogues \nwith orthogonally protected or masked functional groups \nmight be less exhaustive. Isolation of such derivatives \ncould also be more straightforward enabling more ver -\nsatility for further functionalization. There are a few \nother well-characterized enzymes among ODHs such \nas the octopine dehydrogenase from Pecten maximus  \n(PmOcDH) (Smits et al. 2008) or metallophore biosyn-\nthetic enzymes from Staphylococcus aureus ( SaODH), \nPseudomonas aeruginosa ( PaODH), and Yersinia pestis  \n(YpODH) (McFarlane et al. 2018). These all have differ -\nent substrate preferences; PmOcDH is specific for pyru-\nvate and l-arginine, while the enzymes from pathogens \nuse exotic nicotianamine-like amino acid derivatives and \npyruvate or α-ketoglutarate. We may add that this chemi-\ncal diversity has not yet been exploited fully for bioca-\ntalysis. In addition, there are a lot of sequences in public \ndatabases annotated as opine dehydrogenases, but the \ninformation on their activity and substrate preferences is \nlacking; therefore, the above-mentioned diversity is prob-\nably even greater. Metagenome search is a method that \nis capable of sampling a diversity while simultaneously \nselecting for advantageous properties (Robinson et al. \n2021). It involves the interrogation of the whole genetic \ninformation extracted from a certain environment. Today, \nwe have the technology of finding genes and enzymes in \nsuch metagenomic samples, without identifying the—pos-\nsibly unknown—host organisms (Kerepesi et al. 2014, \n2015; Kerepesi and Grolmusz 2016a, b, 2017). This \nallows access to potential biocatalysts from previously \nuncharacterized species that could exhibit altered sub-\nstrate specificity, increased thermotolerance or catalytic \nactivity. This method was already applied to find novel \nenzymes for chiral amine synthesis such as transaminases \n(Baud et al. 2017; Leipold et al. 2019) or amine dehydro-\ngenases (Caparco et al. 2020). For opine dehydrogenases, \na recent paper describes one novel metagenome-derived \nalanopine dehydrogenase (Kaličanin et al. 2023), but no \nfurther enzymes are reported to date.\nIn our study, we set out to expand the class of ODHs \nwith new enzymes with useful properties for industrial bio-\ncatalysis. We applied metagenome mining to identify novel \nODHs from extreme environments. The catalytic activity \nand substrate preference of the newly discovered enzymes \nwere investigated under conditions relevant for biocatalytic \napplications. Their unique structural and sequential fea-\ntures were thoroughly analyzed to aid future engineering of \nthese enzymes towards industrial applications with specific \nsubstrates.\nMaterials and methods\nAll reagents and solvents, amino acids, and ketoacids were \ncommercially available and used without further purification.\nApplied Microbiology and Biotechnology (2024) 108:101 \n Page 3 of 16 101\nHPLC methods\nAnalytical HPLC measurements were performed on Agi-\nlent Technologies 1260 LC system equipped with a DAD \ndetector using Gemini® 3 µm NX-C18, 50 mm × 3.00 mm \ni.d. 110 Å column, and 5 mM aqueous  NH4HCO3 solu-\ntion and MeCN as eluents in gradient mode. Analytical \nLC–MS was performed on an Agilent Technologies 1200 \nLC system equipped with Agilent 6140 quadrupole MS, \noperating in positive or negative ion electrospray ionization \nmode (molecular weight scan range was 100 to 1350 m/z) \nwith parallel UV detection using Gemini® 3 µm NX-C18, \n50 mm × 3.00 mm i.d. 110 Å column, and 5 mM aqueous \n NH4HCO3 solution and MeCN as eluents in gradient mode. \nPurifications were carried out with Teledyne Isco prepara-\ntive HPLC using Gemini® 5 µm NX-C18, 250 mm × 50 mm \ni.d. 110 Å column, and 5 mM aqueous  NH4HCO3 solution \nand MeCN as eluents in gradient mode.\nNMR measurements\n1H NMR and 13C NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker \nAvance Ultrashield 400 (100 MHz 13C) instrument with \nBruker Prodigy Cryo Probe and were internally referenced \nto residual protium solvent signals (note:  D2O referenced at \n4.70 ppm). Samples (5–10 mg) were dissolved in 0.5 mL \n D2O. In the case of Fmoc-2a products, 4 µL trifluoroacetic \nacid (TFA) was added for complete dissolution. Data for 1H \nNMR are reported as follows: chemical shift (δ  ppm), mul-\ntiplicity (s = singlet, d = doublet, dd = doublet of a doublet, \nt = triplet, dt = doublet of a triplet, m = multiplet), coupling \nconstant (Hz), and integration. Fmoc-derivatized products \nform amide rotamers appearing as doubled signals which \nis indicated by the two δ (ppm) values separated by a slash, \ne.g., 8.38/8.31 (d/d, J  = 1.3/1.4 Hz, 1 H). Assignments of \nprotons are listed on the spectra (Figure S7-S14). Data for \n13C NMR are reported in terms of chemical shift, and no \nspecial nomenclature is used for equivalent carbons.\nHigh resolution mass spectrometry\nHRMS measurements were carried out on an Agilent 6545 \nQ-TOF mass spectrometer system: mass resolution, 45.000 \nFWHM @ m/z 2.722 Da; ion source, AJS-ESI; sheath gas \ntemperature, 300 °C; drying gas temperature, 300 °C; ion-\nizing voltage, 2500 V; and nozzle voltage, 1000 V.\nMetagenome search\nThe method is based on an artificial intelligence tool, the \nhidden Markov models (HMMs) (Yoon 2009), described in \ndetail by Szalkai and Grolmusz (2019), and is demonstrated \non our webserver for smaller metagenomes (< 1 GB) at the \naddress https:// metah mm. pitgr oup. org.\nFirst, we trained our metagenome search tool on ten dif-\nferent, already described opine dehydrogenase sequences \n(listed in Table S1). From these sequences, using multi-\nple alignment with Clustal Omega software as a middle \nstep (Sievers et al. 2011), a hidden Markov model was \nbuilt with the hmmbuild tool (Eddy 2009). Applying the \nMarkov model, we selected tens of thousands of short reads \nfrom the target metagenomes applying the hmmsearch \ntool (Eddy 2009 ). The target metagenomes were down -\nloaded from the NCBI Short Read Archive, with accession \nnumbers SRR2915707 (deep-sea sediment metagenome), \nSRR16646004 (tropical soil metagenome), SRR16606022 \n(hot spring metagenome, Sativali), and SRR16588181 (hot \nspring metagenome, Tuwa). The hits from the metagen-\nomes were assembled into the longest possible sequences \nby the MegaHIT assembler (Li et al. 2015), and from these \nsequences, we selected potential complete genes with start \nand end codons (Table  S2). Nucleotide sequence data \nreported are available in the Third Party Annotation (TPA) \nSection of the DDBJ/ENA/GenBank databases under the \naccession numbers TPA: BK063522-BK063532.\nSequence analysis and structural modelling \nof mODHs\nSequence similarity network (SSN) of the new mODHs and \nthe template ODHs was created using the Enzyme Similar -\nity Tool (EFI-EST, https:// efi. igb. illin ois. edu/ efi- est/) (Zallot \net al. 2019). Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic \ntrees were generated using Clustal Omega (https:// www. ebi. \nac. uk/ Tools/ msa/ clust alo/). Structural modelling of mODHs \nwas carried out by open source AlphaFold prediction algo-\nrithm accessed through ColabFold (Mirdita et al. 2022). \nStructures were visualized and analyzed in PyMOL. Elec-\ntrostatic surface potential calculations were performed using \nthe APBS (Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver, https://  \nwww. poiss onbol tzmann. org/) plugin in PyMOL (https://  \nwww. pymol. org/ pymol). Analysis of binding pockets was \naided by Caver Web v1.2 (https:// losch midt. chemi. muni. cz/ \ncaver web/) (Stourac et al. 2019).\nEnzyme production and purification\nNine selected mODH genes as well as the coding sequence \nof ArODH were codon optimized for E. coli, synthesized by \nGenescript and cloned into pET14b vector using NdeI and \nBamHI cloning sites resulting in N-terminal His-tag proteins \n(for protein and nucleotide sequences see Table S2). Plas-\nmids were transformed into E.coli BL21(DE3) chemically \ncompetent cells, and 5 mL overnight cultures were grown \n Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology (2024) 108:101\n101 Page 4 of 16\nin Luria–Bertani (LB) medium supplemented with carbeni-\ncillin. Then, 4 mL was added to 500 mL fresh LB medium. \nThe culture was grown at 37 °C to OD = 0.5 and induced by \naddition of 0.5 mM IPTG. The flasks were then incubated \nin a shaker at 18 °C overnight. The cells were harvested \nby centrifugation at 4000 rpm, 4 °C for 30 min. The pel-\nlets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH = 8.5, \n300 mM NaCl, 1 mM benzamidine, 2 mM phenylmethyl-\nsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), 1 mM Tris(2-carboxyethyl)phos-\nphine (TCEP), DNase) and lysed by ultrasonication. The \nsuspension was centrifuged at 11,000 rpm, 4 °C for 30 min. \nThe supernatant was loaded onto equilibrated Ni–NTA col-\numn and washed with 15 mM imidazole in lysis buffer. The \nbound protein was eluted with 250 mM imidazole in lysis \nbuffer and then dialyzed in 50 mM Tris pH = 8.5. The result-\ning solution was aliquoted after addition of 10% glycerol and \nthen stored at − 20 °C until further use. Total protein concen-\ntration was determined based on absorption at 280 nm meas-\nured on a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. With this method, \nsix mODHs and ArODH could be purified (see Table S2). \nThree mODHs were not expressed in soluble form in this \nexperimental setting.\nSite‑directed mutagenesis\nMutagenesis experiments were conducted according to the \nQ5® Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit Quick Protocol pro -\nvided by the manufacturer (Table S6). KLD reactions were \ntransformed into XL1Blue chemically competent cells and \nwere plated on LB-TC/CAR agarose plates. Single colonies \nwere picked and used to inoculate 5 mL overnight cultures. \nFrom these, plasmids were purified according to the Nucle-\noSpin Plasmid Prep protocol. The purified plasmids were \nsent to sequencing to verify mutations and then used for \nprotein expression.\nDifferential scanning fluorimetry (Thermofluor) \nmeasurements\nTo 1 mg/mL solutions of enzymes (mODHs, ArODH) was \nadded 1000 × SYPRO Orange dye. Twenty-five-microliter \nsamples were loaded onto 96-well plates in triplicates. Fluo-\nrescent signal versus temperature was in a CFX96 real-time \nPCR detection system (Bio-Rad) with a gradient from 25 to \n95 °C (0.5 °C steps).\nKinetic measurements\nEnzyme activities were measured spectrophotometrically at \n30 °C in 96-well half-area plates in a Thermo Scientific™ \nMultiskan SkyHigh Microplate Spectrophotometer (Thermo \nFisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). Standard assays \nwere carried out by using 15 mM amino acid and 0.2 mM \nNAD(P)H in 100 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH = 8.0). \nThe reaction was started by the addition of 10 mM pyruvate. \nThe decrease in absorbance was monitored at 340 nm. Initial \nvelocities (v0) were calculated from the linear section of the \nplots using an NAD(P)H calibration. For the determination \nof kinetic constants, amino acid concentrations were var -\nied between 1 and 30 mM, while cofactor concentrations \nwere between 0.04 and 0.5 mM. Depending on the specific \nactivities of each enzyme, enzyme concentrations were \nfixed between 0.015 and 1.5 µM (Tables S9-S12). Kinetic \nconstants were determined from the Michaelis–Menten \nplots using GraphPad Prism software (Tables S9-S12, Fig-\nures S15-S18). Heat stability experiments were carried out \nby incubating the enzymes at 40, 50, or 60 °C for 1 h before \nmeasuring their specific activities.\nSmall scale biocatalytic reactions, parameter opti‑\nmizations\nFor preliminary activity measurements and reaction optimi-\nzation, the reaction mixtures (500 µL) contained 62.5 mM \nd-glucose, 6 U/mL GDH (Codexis CDX-901, 50 U/mg), \n0.4 mM  NAD+/NADP+, 25 mM amino acid substrate, and \n5 equivalents of sodium pyruvate substrate in Na-phosphate \nbuffer adjusted to pH 7.5 in a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube. To \nthe blank mix was added 30 µg purified enzyme (mODHs, \nArODH). The reaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C \nwith shaking at 300 rpm for 24 h. Parameters were opti-\nmized on the following ranges: pH 6.0–8.0, temperature \n30–50 °C, pyruvate equivalence 1.5–5.0, and enzyme load-\ning 7.5–60 µg/mL. To follow the reactions, 100-µL sam-\nples were taken and derivatized based on the protocol from \nTassano et al. (2022). Samples were diluted 1:1 with Na-\nborate buffer (300 mM, pH 9.2), then 200 µL of a solution \nof Fmoc-Cl (15 mM in ACN) was added, and the samples \nwere shaken for 10 min, 30 °C, and at 1000 rpm. Next, 200 \nµL solution of amantadine hydrochloride (300 mM in 1:1 \n H2O/ACN) was added. The formed white precipitate was \ncentrifuged 5 min/1500 rpm, and the supernatant was ana-\nlyzed. Analysis was done on HPLC–MS. The conversion \nwas calculated by measuring the depletion of the amino acid \nas follows: HPLC area of the Fmoc-amino acid peak in the \nenzymatic reaction was compared to that of blank reactions \ncarried out under identical conditions without ODH present.\nSubstrate screening\nOn a 1-mL 96-deep-well plate, 500 µL reactions were carried \nout. The reaction mixtures contained 62.5 mM d-glucose, 6 U/\nmL GDH (Codexis CDX-901, 50 U/mg), 0.4 mM  NADP+ (or \n NAD+ for ArODH), 25 mM amino acid substrate, and 75 mM \nof ketoacid substrate in Na-phosphate buffer adjusted to \npH = 8.0.

The reaction mixtures were incubated \nat 40 °C with shaking at 300 rpm for 24 h. Reactions were \nperformed in triplicates. Sample preparation and calculation \nof conversion were done as described in the previous section, \nand analysis was carried out on HPLC.\nPreparative scale reactions and purifications\n30 mL reaction mixture contained 62.5 mM d-glucose, 6 U/\nmL GDH (Codexis CDX-901, 50 U/mg), 0.4 mM  NADP+, and \n25 mM amino acid substrate with 3 equivalents of sodium pyru-\nvate in Na-phosphate buffer adjusted to pH 8.0. To the blank \nmix was added 900 µg purified enzyme (ArODH or mODH-\n582). The reaction mixture was stirred at 40 °C for 24 h.

We mined the literature for enzymes with known pri-\nmary structure and confirmed activity to avoid falsely anno-\ntated sequences. In the end, we have collected 11 sequences \nfrom a diverse set of organisms and with wide substrate and \ncofactor preferences (see Fig.  1 and Table S1). These were \nused to construct a multiple sequence alignment to train \na hidden Markov model (HMM), as described in a recent \npublication (Szalkai and Grolmusz 2019). In order to find \nenzymes with preferable properties for industrial biocataly-\nsis, we selected datasets from NCBI Short Read Archive \ncollected from extreme environments (see “Materials and \nMethods”). The trained HMM was used to extract full-\nlength sequences resembling the general features of ODHs. \nFrom the four different datasets (see “Materials and Meth-\nods”), only one, the Sativali hot spring (67 °C) (Narsing \nRao et al. 2022), metagenome provided new putative ODH \ngenes. From that dataset, 11 sequences were obtained that \nshowed remarkably low sequence identity (< 40%) with all \ntemplate sequences used while displaying higher degree \nof similarity among each other (Fig.  1A and B). Interest -\ningly, although the HMM included characteristics from all \nthe 11 diverse ODHs, still, for all of the finally identified \nmODHs, the closest homologue in the template set is the \nODH from Arthrobacter sp. 1C (ArODH). Since ArODH \nis the only known example of an ODH used in biocatalysis, \nwe decided to use it as a reference enzyme for the charac-\nterization of the metagenomic ODHs (mODHs) as potential \nnew biocatalysts. From the 11 sequences, we have discarded \ntwo due to the lack of a consensus sequence required for \ncofactor binding at the front of these genes (see Table S2). \nThus, we have ordered ten synthetic genes (nine mODHs \nand ArODH), cloned into pET14b vector, expressed them in \nE. coli and purified them. Three metagenomic enzymes did \nnot exhibit soluble expression in our system, so in the end, \nsix mODHs and ArODH were obtained with yields between \n10 and 70 mg/L culture. Those metagenomic enzymes have \nclose to 40% sequence identity to ArODH but have varying \ndegree of similarity (~ 45–80%) among each other (Fig. 1C).\nSubstrate screen for mODHs\nAs the main aim of our study was to explore and exploit \nthe synthetic utility of the newly discovered enzymes, we \nhave tested their activity in small scale biocatalytic reactions \n(Scheme 1), where their activity is measured by the apparent \nconversion to the product. The reactions were followed by \nHPLC with UV and MS detection. Since most of the used \nsubstrates had poor retention on normal phase and weak UV \nsignal, we have applied a derivatization method (Tassano \net al. 2022) to follow the consumption of the amino acid \nsubstrate (see “Materials and Methods”). The presence of \nthe product could be confirmed based on its MS signal. Pre-\nliminary experiments showed that mODHs have negligible \nactivity with the best amino acid substrates of ArODH, like \nl-norvaline or l-phenylalanine and only few percent con-\nversion with l-alanine when using NADH, the usual cofac-\ntor for ArODH. In the latter case, the observable product \nformation prompted us to test NADPH instead of NADH \nas cofactor, which yielded enhanced conversions (data not \nshown). Therefore, NADPH was used for the optimization \nof reaction conditions and substrate screening. Next, after \nscreening a restricted set of natural amino acids including \napolar (alanine, leucine, valine, methinonine), polar (ser -\nine, threonine, asparagine, glutamine), and charged ones \n(aspartate, glutamate), we have identified l-aspartate (3) to \nbe a preferred substrate for mODHs. Pyruvate (a ) is often \nthe only ketoacid substrate of ODHs; therefore, we did not \nconsider changing that substrate at this stage. We used the \nApplied Microbiology and Biotechnology (2024) 108:101 \n Page 7 of 16 101\nFig. 1  A Sequence similarity network (SSN) of ODHs with a con-\nnection threshold of 30% sequence identity.

The optimum conditions are different from \nthe ones normally used for ArODH with higher temperature \n(30 vs. 40 °C) and slightly higher pH (7.5 vs. 8.0) (Kato \net al. 1996) (Scheme 1).\nUsing these conditions, we set out to investigate the activ-\nity of mODHs on a diverse set of amino acid and ketoacid \nsubstrates. Amino acids included 13 canonical (1–4, 13–21) \nand 13 non-canonical amino acids (5–12, 22–26), while on \nthe ketoacid side, only natural substrates were tested (see \nTables S3 and S4). The screening results show that in con-\ntrast to ArODH’s preference for apolar amino acid substrates, \nmODHs exhibit the highest conversions with polar amino \nacids, mostly with negatively charged sidechains (Fig.  2). \nl-Aspartate (3) and l-glutamate (4) clearly stand out among \nthe natural amino acids with four of six mODHs exhibiting \n100% conversion with the former and above 50% with the \nlatter. Exchanging the carboxylate with a sulfonate group \n(l-cysteic acid (7) or homocysteic acid (9)) results in similar \nor even better substrates for mODHs. Notably, phosphoryl-\nated amino acids (5, 6) are converted significantly less effi-\nciently, even though mODHs are still superior to ArODH in \nthese reactions. Aromatic side chains are generally not well \ntolerated by mODHs; however, l-histidine (2) is transformed \nwith conversions comparable to ArODH, while mODH-48 \nis also capable of transforming 4-carboxy- l-phenylalanine \n(8) with moderate conversion. Opine dehydrogenases have \nstrong enantiomer specificity towards l-amino acids (Telek \net al. 2023). mODHs share this feature as we could dem-\nonstrate by comparing conversions with d- and l-aspartate \n(data not shown). This strong specificity can explain the \nmoderate conversions with racemic amino acids (homocyst-\neic acid (9), 2-aminopimelic acid (10), homoserine (11)) that \notherwise proved to be good substrates of mODHs. Among \nketoacids, pyruvate (a ) is clearly preferred above all oth-\ners. α-Ketobutyrate (c ) is accepted to some extent, while \nconversions with glyoxylate (b) and α-ketoglutarate (d) are \nnegligible (except for mODH-47).\nKinetic characterization of mODHs\nAfter testing the mODHs in small-scale biocatalytic reac-\ntions, we wanted to gain insight into their kinetic properties \nthat govern the above-described apparent catalytic activi-\nties. We have performed Michaelis–Menten kinetic studies \nto assess the amino acid substrate kinetics and determined \nkinetic constants for NADH/NADPH (Table 1). The mODHs \nshow similar characteristics in their turnover numbers (kcat); \nthe differences between their catalytic efficiencies can be \nFig. 2  Selected results from the substrate screening of mODHs. (For \ndata for all substrates, see SI.) A Canonical amino acid substrates \n(pyruvate is fixed as ketoacid substrate). B Enantiopure non-canon-\nical amino acid substrates (pyruvate is fixed as ketoacid substrate). \nC Racemic non-natural amino acid substrates (pyruvate is fixed as \nketoacid substrate). Since these substrates were used as racemates, \nthe maximal conversion is expected to be 50% assuming full enan-\ntiomer selectivity towards l-amino acids. D Ketoacid substrates \n(l-aspartate is fixed as amino acid substrate). Conversions were \ncalculated as depletion of the amino acid substrate in a small scale \nbiocatalytic reaction. Each reaction was measured in triplicates, and \nerror bars represent the standard deviation calculated (see Tables S3 \nand S4)\nApplied Microbiology and Biotechnology (2024) 108:101 \n Page 9 of 16 101\nattributed to their K M values which can deviate more than \nan order of magnitude from each other. The cofactor kinet-\nics corroborate our assumption of NADPH preference for \nmost of mODHs with the exception of mODH-48 which \nshows similar catalytic efficiency with NADH and mODH-\n582 which appears to prefer NADH. In the latter case, the \ncatalytic efficiency with NADPH is still comparable to the \nother mODHs.\nHeat stability of mODHs\nThe mODH sequences have been identified from the \nmetagenomic data that were collected for microbial commu-\nnities living under extreme conditions such as in hot springs. \nIt was therefore of interest to decide if their protein stability \nmay reflect adaptation to the extreme conditions. We applied \ndifferential scanning fluorimetry (Niesen et al. 2007; Gao \net al. 2020) to determine the melting point of these mODH \nproteins. As also shown in Table 2, all mODHs that we puri-\nfied showed drastic increase (15–30 °C) in thermal stabil-\nity as compared to the model ArODH (see also Figure S2 \nfor raw melting curve data). This result is encouraging for \nenzyme stability under chemical process conditions.\nIn addition, we have performed heat stability experiments \nby incubating the enzymes at varying temperatures before \nmeasuring their specific activities. From the residual activi-\nties, it is clear that while ArODH loses activity at 50 °C, the \nmetagenomic enzymes show moderate or no loss of activity \neven at 60 °C (Fig. 3). This result indicates that the metagen-\nomic enzymes derived from a hot spring have not only \nhigher melting temperatures (see above) but they can also \nretain their activity after exposure to higher temperatures.\nMolecular determinants of substrate preference\nIn order to better understand the factors determining the dif-\nferent amino acid substrate preferences of ODHs, we per -\nformed detailed analysis of their sequences and structures. \nFor the latter structures, models predicted by AlphaFold \nwere used. The overall structure of mODHs resembles well \nother opine dehydrogenases even with very low sequence \nidentity (Fig.  4). The structural family of enzymes sharing \nthis overall fold is named octopine dehydrogenases (Pfam \n02317) after the first and most well-characterized enzyme \nfrom Pecten maximus ( PmOcDH) (Smits et al. 2008) and \noctopine synthases (OCS) from naturally transgenic plants \n(Hack and Kemp 1980; Matveeva and Otten 2021). ArODH \nis also part of this structural class as outlined by several \npublications (Britton et al. 1998; Smits et al. 2008; Sharma \net al. 2017). A general feature of this class is the two-domain \nstructure, an NAD(P)H-binding domain at the N-terminus \nand a substrate binding domain at the C-terminus. The two \ndomains form a cleft together, wherein catalysis can take \nTable 1  Kinetic parameters of mODHs.

Based on these similarities, it \ncan be assumed that findings describing the general mode \nof action of ODHs (Smits et al. 2010; Sharma et al. 2017; \nMcFarlane et al. 2018) are applicable to the new mODHs \nas well.\nHowever, the factors determining substrate specific-\nity were still unclear, so we set out to investigate that by \nbioinformatic as well as experimental means. Compar -\ning active site residues corresponding to those mutated \nby Codexis (see Table S5), mostly only subtle differences \nappear between ArODH and mODHs. A notable exception \nis the position 111 in ArODH, where an alanine is replaced \nby an arginine in all mODHs. We hypothesized that this \nchange can be responsible for the substrate preference of \nmODHs towards amino acids with negatively charged side \nchains. Therefore, we performed mutagenesis on mODH-\n582 to have the variant R110A. We also created a “control \nmutant” ArODH A111R. Testing the activity of these vari-\nants on l-aspartate and l-phenylalanine and comparing them \nto the wild-type enzymes revealed loss of activity with the \noriginal substrates, but no gain of activity towards the other \n(Table S7). This result prompted us to further inspect the \nactive site of ODHs, and we realized that the position 198 \nmight be spatially correlated with the position 111. ArODH \nhas an asparagine opposite to A111 while all mODHs pos-\nsess glycine in that position leaving more space to the longer \narginine side chain. Therefore, we prepared double mutant \nvariants mODH-582 R110A G198N and ArODH A111R \nN198G. We tested these variants with l-aspartate and l-phe-\nnylalanine and observed a complete switch of substrate pref-\nerence (Fig. 4C). We carried out the kinetic characterization \nof these variants and compared the results to the wild-type \nenzymes (Table 3). Here, we observed no apparent reaction \nwith the non-preferred substrates; thus, the change in sub-\nstrate preference could be clearly demonstrated.\nIn addition to the site-directed mutagenesis studies, we \ndecided to also take a holistic approach towards rational-\nizing the substrate preference of ODHs. We performed \nAPBS (Adaptive Poisson-Boltzmann Solver) calculations \nto assess the electrostatic surface potential of mODHs. In \naccordance with our experimental results showing a pref-\nerence of mODHs for negatively charged substrates, all \nmODHs show a remarkable accumulation of positive sur -\nface charge inside their active sites in strong contrast to the \nclose to neutral surface potential of the ArODH active site \n(Fig. 5B and C, Figure S3). To follow up on this result, we \nwanted to identify specific residues that could be respon-\nsible for this charge accumulation inside the cleft between \nTable 2  Melting temperatures \nof mODHs measured by \ndifferential scanning fluorimetry\nEnzyme Melting \ntemperature \n(°C)\nArODH 44.0 ± 0.3\nmODH-45 74.0 ± 0.5\nmODH-47 60.0 ± 0.3\nmODH-48 63.0 ± 0.3\nmODH-49 61.0 ± 0.0\nmODH-55 71.0 ± 0.3\nmODH-582 74.5 ± 0.5\nFig. 3  Residual specific activi-\nties of ODHs after 1-h incuba-\ntion at different temperatures", "metadata": {"chunk_id": "38229296:0", "pdf_file": "/Users/viku/Documents/UIUC/work/PETase/data/ired/38229296.pdf", "title": "Vol.:(0123456789)"}}

Therefore, \nwe scaled up and modified the protocol to yield better \nconversion to the Fmoc derivative of 2a (Fmoc-2a). This \ncompound was isolated from both reactions with yields \n40% for ArODH and 20% for mODH. Meanwhile, we have \nalso prepared reference compounds (Fmoc-(1R ,2S)-2a* \nand Fmoc-(1S ,2S)-2a) by chemical reductive amination of \npyruvate (a) with l-histidine (2) (see “Materials and Meth-\nods”). The resulting diastereomers were isolated, and their \nNMR spectra were compared with the enzymatic prod -\nucts (Figure S4). Fmoc-(1R ,2S)-2a* and Fmoc-(1S ,2S)-2a \ngive distinguishable signals, and the enzymatic products \nclearly correspond to Fmoc-(1 R,2S)-2a *. In addition, \ncomparison of the retention times of Fmoc- 2a products \nof chemical and enzymatic origin also supports identical \nselectivity of ArODH and mODH-582 (Figure S5). Since \nthe R-selectivity of ArODH is already well established \n(Asano et al. 1989), we concluded that mODH-582 has \nalso R-stereoselectivity in the reductive amination. The \ndiastereoselectivity of the rest of the mODHs was found \nidentical to mODH-582 and ArODH by performing ana-\nlytical scale reactions with l-histidine ( 2) and compar -\ning the LC chromatograms after Fmoc-derivatization \n(Figure S6). We have also carried out preparative scale \ntransformations with mODH-582 using the best substrates \nof mODHs, l-aspartate (3 ), and l-cysteic acid (4 ) with \npyruvate (a ) as ketoacid partner. The enzymatic reactions \nreached > 99% conversion, and the products were isolated \nas their Fmoc derivatives (24% for Fmoc-(1R ,2S)-3a, 23% \nfor Fmoc-(1R ,2R)-7a, Scheme  2). Here, the configuration \nof the new stereocenter is assumed to be R based on the \ndiastereoselectivity observed with l-histidine.\nWhile scaling up the reactions with the preferred sub-\nstrates, we have revisited the question of cofactor prefer -\nence, which was only determined before in preliminary \nexperiments with l-alanine and later corroborated by kinetic \nmeasurements (see above), but not in biocatalytic reactions. \nTo our surprise, with  l-aspartate, some enzymes (mODH-\n48, mODH-49, mODH-55, and mODH-582) have exhibited \nbetter conversions using NADH as cofactor (see Table S8). \nThis result shows that the better kinetic parameters not nec-\nessarily translate into higher conversion values under biocat-\nalytic reaction conditions. It also suggests that the cofactor \npreference of some mODHs might be substrate dependent.\nDiscussion\nOpine dehydrogenases are a diverse class of enzymes spe-\ncialized to perform wide ranging physiological roles in \norganisms across the tree of life. Substrate specificities of \neach enzyme have evolved to perform a certain physiological \nfunction in the given organism. Mining opine dehydroge-\nnases from metagenomes of extreme environments allows \nfor identification of new enzymes with altered substrate \nspecificities that could evolve under significantly different \nevolutionary pressure. In fact, the metagenomic opine dehy-\ndrogenases (mODHs) discovered within the framework of \nthis study appear to be from an evolutionarily distant sub-\nclass of ODHs (Fig.  1) that was previously not described. \nSequence identity to closest homologues deposited in Uni-\nProtKB varies between 62 and 99%, and all of them are \nunreviewed, while mODH-48 is identical to an obsolete \nentry in UniParc (Table S2). Their overall structure—as \npredicted by AlphaFold—resembles well other opine dehy-\ndrogenases even with very low sequence identity. However, \nthey exhibit unique properties that make them a valuable \naddition to this underexplored enzyme class. Being derived \nfrom a hot spring metagenome, they show increased ther -\nmotolerance which is indicated by higher melting tempera-\ntures, resistance to heat inactivation, and increased optimum \ntemperature.

{"text": "Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology (2024) 108:101\n101 Page 14 of 16\nnegatively charged amino acid substrates is so far unprec-\nedented for ODHs. The molecular background of the differ-\nent amino acid substrate specificities of ODHs has not yet \nbeen elucidated to date. Several residues have been proposed \nto form key interactions in the active site with the amino \nacid substrate (Smits et al. 2008; McFarlane et al. 2018), but \nthere was no indication that the amino acid preference would \nbe tuneable by manipulating any of these residues. In this \nstudy, we demonstrated the switch of the amino acid prefer-\nence in two investigated ODHs by mutating two spatially \ncorrelated positions. In addition to these two residues that \ndirectly influence substrate specificity, we have also consid-\nered global factors that can contribute to the preference of \nmODHs towards negatively charged amino acids. We have \nfound that there is a significant accumulation of positive \nsurface charge in the mODHs active site compared to the \nneutral surface of ArODH as revealed by APBS electrostatic \npotential calculations.\nWe have thoroughly analyzed the positions that can be \nresponsible for this phenomenon and found that these posi-\ntions are located mostly at the edges of the catalytic cleft \nrather than inside, where the catalysis takes place and nega-\ntive charge changes can also be pinpointed. Overall, we can \nhypothesize that the preference of mODHs towards nega-\ntively charged substrates is aided by this positively charged \nmicroenvironment inside the catalytic pocket. The fact that \nsubstitutions generating this charged microenvironment are \nnot identical for all mODHs suggests that they might have \nevolved independently from a common ancestor to perform \nthe same or similar functions.\nThe newly discovered opine dehydrogenases have a clear \npreference for l-amino acids in line with previous obser -\nvations (Telek et al. 2023). The diastereoselectivity (dic-\ntated by the stereoselectivity in the formation of the new \nstereocenter) also follows the general trend of ODHs, i.e., \nR-selectivity can be assumed in the reductive amination step \nbased on experimental results with l-histidine.\nThe kinetic parameters of mODHs also align well \nwith previous reports (Telek et al. 2023) even though \ntheir catalytic efficiency compared to ArODH (which is \nat the higher end of the reported values) was found to be \nlower (Table  1 and 3 ). This might be an adverse effect \nof their increased stability which can compromise flex-\nibility reflected in lower k cat values. The latter parameter \ncould be targeted by enzyme engineering which would \nallow the exploitation of their superior thermal stabil-\nity and distant substrate preference. However, it is worth \nmentioning that the better catalytic efficiency observed in \nkinetic measurements does not necessarily translate into \nhigher conversions in biocatalytic reactions. One example \nis mODH-55 which shows superior kinetic parameters to \nmost of other mODHs but fails to reach > 95% conversion \nwith  l-aspartate like others (Fig.  2 and Table  2). These \ndiscrepancies between kinetic measurements and biocata -\nlytic reactions might be attributed to several factors (e.g., \nlong-term enzyme stability and product inhibition) that \ncan influence an enzyme’s stability in an overnight reac-\ntion in contrast to a quick kinetic measurement. These \nfactors might also have an effect on the cofactor prefer -\nence of these enzymes that is somewhat contradictory. In \nbiocatalytic reactions with l-alanine, NADPH has proved \nto be preferred, and this preliminary observation was \nalso corroborated by kinetic data measured with the best \nsubstrate l-aspartate (Table  2). A notable exception was \nmODH-582 that showed clear NADH preference while \nmODH-48 appeared to have no preference. However, in \nbiocatalytic reactions, four of six enzymes performed bet-\nter with NADH (see Table S8). The cofactor preferences \nrevealed by the kinetic data can be explained by examin-\ning the cofactor binding site of the enzymes. Position 35 \n(ArODH numbering) has already been proposed to deter -\nmine cofactor preference of ODHs in pathogenic bacteria \n(Laffont et al. 2019), where an arginine in that position \nensures preferential binding of NADPH. In ArODH and \nmODH-582 that show clear NADH preference, aliphatic \namino acids can be found in this position (alanine and \nisoleucine, respectively), while all other mODHs possess \nan arginine there (Fig.  6). This suggests that an arginine \nin position 35 is a good indicator that NADPH is accepted \nas a cofactor for the enzyme even if a clear preference \ntowards it is not always observed. However, since these \npredictions are not necessarily translatable to behaviors \nin biocatalytic reactions (especially with different sub-\nstrates), for further experiments on these enzymes, we \nFig. 6  Multiple sequence alignment of ArODH an mODHs. Position 35 (ArODH numbering) is highlighted. An arginine (magenta) in this posi-\ntion indicates NADPH preference\nApplied Microbiology and Biotechnology (2024) 108:101 \n Page 15 of 16 101\nsuggest that cofactor preference should be established \nfor each enzyme using the particular conditions and sub-\nstrates for any future development.\nIn conclusion, with the discovery of metagenomic \nopine dehydrogenases (mODHs), we were able to add a \nnew subclass to the opine dehydrogenase family with so \nfar unprecedented substrate specificity. The newly iden-\ntified enzymes have a strong preference for polar amino \nacids, especially those with negatively charged side chain. \nThis preference is governed by two spatially correlated \npositions that can be used to switch substrate specificity \nof ODHs by site-directed mutagenesis. The preference \ntowards negatively charged amino acids can be further \nrationalized by an overall positively charged surface area \nwithin the active site. Importantly, the six mODHs dis-\nplay higher melting temperature and better resistance to \nheat inactivation compared to the so far best characterized \nenzyme (ArODH) which is a promising property from \nan industrial perspective. Their enantio- and diastereose-\nlectivity are proposed to be identical to known ODHs \n(preference for l-amino acids and R-selectivity on the \nnewly form C-N bond). Overall, these enzymes offer good \nstarting points for biocatalytic applications aiming at the \nsynthesis of highly functionalized peptidomimetic build-\ning blocks.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplemen-\ntary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s00253- 023- 12871-z.\nAcknowledgements The authors thank the Analytical Department of \nSRIMC for the analytical development and the characterization of the \ncompounds.\nAuthor contribution AT, ZM, GT, and BGV conceived and designed \nresearch, analyzed data, and wrote the paper.

However,\na detailed understanding of the stereocontrol mechanism of IRED remains incomplete, making the design\nof IRED for producing the desired amine enantiomers challenging. In this study, we investigated the\nstereoselective catalytic mechanism and designed an ( R)-stereoselective IRED from Paenibacillus\nmucilaginosus (PmIR) using pharmaceutically relevant 2-aryl-substituted pyrrolines as substrates. A\nputative mechanism for controlling stereoselectivity was proposed based on the crucial role of\nelectrostatic interactions in controlling iminium cation orientation and employed to achieve complete\ninversion of stereoselectivity inPmIR using computational design. The variantPmIR-Re (Q138M/P140M/\nY187E/Q190A/D250M/R251N) exhibited opposite (S)-stereoselectivity, with >96% enantiomeric excess\n(ee) towards tested 2-aryl-substituted pyrrolines. Computational tools were employed to identify\nstabilizing mutations at the interface between the two subunits. The variantPmIR-6P (P140A/Q190S/\nR251N/Q217E/A257R/T277M) showed a nearly 5-fold increase in activity and a 12 °C increase in melting\ntemperature. The PmIR-6P successfully produced (R)-2-(2,5-diﬂuorophenyl)-pyrrolidine, a key chiral\npharmaceutical intermediate, at a concentration of 400 mM with an ee exceeding 99%. This study\nprovides insight into the stereocontrol elements of IREDs and demonstrates the potential of\ncomputational design for tailored stereoselectivity and thermal stability.\nIntroduction\nImine reductase (IRED) plays an important role as a biocatalyst\nin the asymmetric synthesis of optically pure amines, and it\nexhibits the ability to catalyze various transformations,\nincluding cyclic imine asymmetric reduction, direct asymmetric\nreductive amination, and stepwise conjugate reduction fol-\nlowed by reductive amination.\n1–3 Despite the diverse reactions\ncatalyzed by IREDs, they all involve a pivotal step: the asym-\nmetric reduction of the iminium cation intermediate.4,5 This\nstep is crucial for determining the stereoconguration of the\nnal amine product.\nThe understanding of the specic roles of varying active-site\nresidues in stereocontrol remains limited. To gain insight into\nthe correlation between active site residues and stereo-\nselectivity, multiple studies have compared IREDs exhibiting\nstereocomplementary activity towards 2-methyl-1-pyrroline and\nother cyclic imines.\n6–8 These investigations have led to the\ncategorization of IREDs into two groups based on their opposite\nstereoselectivities and the putative catalytic residues involved.\nY-type IREDs possess tyrosine as a potential proton-donating\namino acid, whereas D-type IREDs feature aspartate at equiva-\nlent position. Although it seemed that the diﬀerent putative\ncatalytic residues, tyrosine and aspartate, led to opposite ster-\neoselectivity of the IREDs, there remain exceptions. In 2015,\nWetzl and coworkers reported IREDs that possessed phenylal-\nanine or asparagine residues at equivalent positions.\n9 In 2016,\nTurner et al.reported an intriguingnding withAoIRED, which\ndemonstrated higher activity and stereoselectivity in asym-\nmetric imine reduction despite the absence of tyrosine or\naspartate residues.\n10 These discoveries suggest that potentially\ndiﬀerent stereocontrol mechanisms are formed by distinct\nactive sites in IREDs. The varying active-site residues and\nunidentied key stereocontrol elements make the rational\ndesign of an IRED for the desired stereoselectivity challenging.\nAdditionally, stability has been emphasized as a crucial factor in\naSchool of Pharmacy, Shanghai University of Medicine & Health Sciences, 279 Zhouzhu\nHighway, Pudong New Area, Shanghai 201318, China.

{"text": "the practical application of evolved IREDs.2,11,12 The conven-\ntional approach for mass screening in directed evolution is\ntime-consuming. However, a rational design approach for\nimproving stereoselectivity and stability remains\nunderdeveloped.\nIn this study, we investigated the possible stereocontrol\nmechanism of IRED in Paenibacillus mucilaginosus (PmIR).\nFurthermore, by employing rational design with catalytic\nconstraints based on a putative stereocontrol mechanism, we\nsuccessfully reversed the stereoselectivity ofPmIR towards 2-\n(2,5-diuorophenyl)pyrroline (2-DFPL) and other 2-aryl-\nsubstituted pyrrolines in thePmIR-Re variant. PmIR-Re repre-\nsents therst instance of overcoming the boundary between Y-\ntype- and D-type IREDs, provides valuable insights into the key\nstereocontrol elements of IREDs, and demonstrates an eﬀective\nmechanism-guided approach for manipulating stereo-\nselectivity. Furthermore, a combinational method including\nsalt-bridge construction andDDG\nfold prediction was applied to\nenable the rapid identi cation of interface mutations for\nstability enhancement. Finally, the engineered variantPmIR-6P\nwas used to successfully produce ( R)-2-(2,5-diuorophenyl)-\npyrrolidine (2-DFPD), a key chiral intermediate of laro-\ntrectinib, demonstrating its potential for practical applications.\nResults and discussion\nA putative stereoselective control mechanism inPmIR\nAlthough the imine reduction step is crucial for determining\nthe stereoconguration of the product in IRED-catalyzed reac-\ntions, the role of active-site residues in stereoselective catalysis\nremains elusive. Several studies have proposed that protic\nresidues, including conserved aspartate and tyrosine located\nnear the NADPH cofactor, serve as proton donors and facilitate\nthe transfer of protons necessary for the reduction of unsatu-\nrated imine bonds.\n5,8 Furthermore, most IREDs possess either\naspartate or tyrosine residues at equivalent positions in the\nactive site, which frequently display opposite stereoselectivity.\n6–8\nThis suggests that these residues not only serve as proton\ndonors but also play a role in controlling stereoselectivity.\nHowever, it should be noted that there are many exceptions to\nthis hypothesis. For instance, AoIRED exhibited high activity\nand stereoselectivity towards 2-methyl-1-pyrroline despite\nhaving an N171 residue in a position equivalent to aspartate or\ntyrosine, suggesting that a protic residue at this position is not\nessential for catalysis.\n9 Conservation analysis of the IRED\ndatabase (https://ired.biocatnet.de/) also revealed that neither\naspartate nor tyrosine residues are completely conserved\namong IREDs.\n13,14 This indicates that a proton donor may not\nbe necessary for catalysis, and that the residues may play\ndiﬀerent roles. From the perspective of the imine substrate,\nwhen the buﬀer pH is lower than the pK\na, the nitrogen atom\nof the imine is protonated to form an iminium cation in the\nsolution. Therefore, we speculated that the active-site residues\nin certain IREDs could merely play a role in binding the\nprotonated iminium cation in a reactive conformation, posi-\ntioning the specicC ]N face at an appropriate distance from\nNADPH. Subsequently, the chirality of the product was\ndetermined by transferring a hydride ion from NADPH to\na prochiral carbon atom on the C]N face (Scheme 1).\nAer screening IREDs stored in our laboratory,PmIR from\nPaenibacillus mucilaginosusemerged as one of the few enzymes\ncapable of catalyzing the reduction of 2-DFPL to yield (R)-2-\nDFPD, which displayed the highest ee, exceeding 96%. Owing to\nthe conserved binding position of NADPH in IREDs,\n5,7,13 the\nPmIR-NADPH complex model was constructed by super-\nimposing the PmIR crystal structure (PDB ID: 8KFK) on the\nNADPH-bound BcSIRED crystal structure (sequence identity\n75.8%). To investigate the key residues ofPmIR controlling the\nasymmetric reduction, 18 residues around Y187 within 10 Å,\nlocated at the subunit interface forming the binding pocket,\nwere targeted for alanine scanning (Fig. S1 and Table S2†). Next,\nkey residues with potential catalytic roles that dramatically\naﬀected the activity or stereoselectivity were subjected to\ndirected mutagenesis to further investigate their role in asym-\nmetric reduction (Table 1). Alanine scanning results indicated\nthat the M194A, F194A, F232A, and F234A mutations led to\nnegligible activity. Both D250A and W195A mutations resulted\nin a complete loss of activity. The alanine mutation of the\npotential proton donor Y187, which is oen considered catalytic\nand conserved in IREDs, displayed a low yet detectable\nconversion with an almost racemic ee of 4%, suggesting the\npossible role of a bulky aromatic side chain in activity and\nstereoselectivity. To further elucidate the contribution of the\nphenolic hydroxyl group of Y187 to imine reduction, the Y187F\nmutant was constructed. The Y187F mutant exhibited\na conversion of 34%, slightly lower than that observed for the\nWT (46.5%), but stereoselectivity increased from 96% to >99%.\nEnzymatic kinetic analysis of the Y187F mutant revealed a 3.6-\nScheme 1 Asymmetric Reduction of Protonated 2-DFPL by IRED.\nTable 1 Site-directed mutagenesis of active site residues and\ncomparison of conversion and enantiomeric excess (ee)\nVariants Conversion a (%) ee (%) Stereoselectivity\nWild type 46.5 /C63.6 96 R\nY187A 4.3 /C61.2 4 R\nY187F 34.8 /C60.9 >99 R\nY187D 2.3 /C60.9 58 R\nY187E 4.5 /C60.8 33 S\nD250A n.d. b n.d. n.d.\nD250E 38.1 /C64.4 97 R\na The reaction mixture (500mL) included 275mL crude enzyme extract\nfrom 50 mg mL−1 resting cells, 50mL of 2.5 mM NADP stock, 50 mM\nglucose, 10 mM substrate, 100 mL crude enzyme of recombinant\nglucose dehydrogenase, and potassium phosphate buﬀer (100 mM,\npH 6.0).

The predicted pKa of 2-DFPL is\n6.60 ± 0.20 (CAS Scinder), suggesting that at least 75% of the\nsubstrate exists in the form of the iminium cation in the reac-\ntion pH of 6.0. In summary, the catalytic activity of the Y187F\nmutant and its decreased substrate aﬃnity suggest that Y187 in\nPmIR primarily contributes to substrate binding during catal-\nysis, rather than serving as a proton donor, which diﬀers from\nthe previously reported role of tyrosine at equivalent positions\nin other IREDs. This indicates that Y187 is a modiable residue\nthat can be used for further enzyme design.\nAspartate is another residue oen considered catalytically\nactive in IREDs. A previous report of a fungal IRED catalyzing\nimine reduction and reductive amination indicated the impor-\ntant role of the Asp active site in binding an imine cation and\namine substrate.\n4 A systematic evaluation of imine-reducing\nenzymes by Pleiss et al. suggested that most IREDs require\na negative electrostatic potential for substrate-binding. 8\nResidue D250 ofPmIR was positioned above Y187, located in the\nbinding pocket, and close to NADPH. A complete loss of activity\nwas observed in the D250A mutant with no detectable products.\nSaturation mutagenesis was performed to investigate the role of\nD250. Most mutations resulted in complete inactivation, except\nfor D250E, which featured a carboxyl group with one additional\nmethyl moiety compared with aspartate. The D250E mutant\nexhibited a comparable ee value,k\ncat, and slightly reducedKM\nvalues (Table 2). The optimal reaction pH forPmIR was deter-\nmined to be 6.0, corresponding to the deprotonated state of the\nacidic residues. Therefore, the complete inactivation of the\nalanine mutation suggests that the loss of activity is primarily\ndue to the absence of a negatively charged deprotonated\ncarboxyl group. Furthermore, using the previously reported (R)-\nselective BcSIRED\n17 catalyzing 2-DFPL with 89% conversion and\n88% ee, negligible conversion (1.7%) and relatively high\nconversion (19%) were observed withBcSIRED mutants D251A\nand Y188F, respectively.

Multiple sequence alignments of\neight IREDs displaying ( R)-stereoselectivity towards 2-aryl-\nsubstituted pyrrolines also revealed that D250 is conserved in\ncertain IRED subgroups (Fig. 1A). Electrostatic interactions\nbetween the negatively charged D250 and iminium cation\nduring catalysis cannot be excluded inPmIR.\nSeveral studies speculated that conformational changes and\ndomain motion of IREDs can aﬀect stereoselectivity.\n9,10,17 The\ncrystal structure alone may have limitations in that it cannot\nreect important motions. Although the crystal structure indi-\ncated that the carboxyl group of D250 was not ideally positioned\nto interact with the iminium cation, MD simulations revealed\nthat D250 was in a exible binding loop (residues 242–251)\n(Fig. S3†), and conformational reorientation of the D250 side\nchain was observed during 100 ns simulations of substrate-free\nPmIR (Fig. 1B). This reorientation suggests that the carboxyl\ngroup could dynamically adjusts to accommodate the positive\niminium cation, stabilizing it in a reactive conformation and\npromoting hydride transfer. Hence, D250 was selected as\na exible residue for molecular docking. The docking results\nindicate preferential binding of the substrate in the pro-R pose\nwith electrostatic interaction to the D250 side chain (Fig. 1C), as\na lower interaction energy of pro-R pose than pro-S pose (−31.9\nvs. −27.2 kcal mol\n−1) was observed. The Y187, F232, F194, and\nW195 form a hydrophobic region that stabilizes 2-DFPL\naromatic ring binding, which could explain why alanine muta-\ntions at these sites resulted in inactive or low activities. These\ninteractions could position the specicC ]N face at an appro-\npriate distance from NADPH.\nBased on the importance of electrostatic interactions and\nhydride transfer during reduction, the distances between the\nimine nitrogen atom and the D250 carboxyl carbon atom (d1),\nand the distance between the imine carbon and NADPH-C4 (d2)\nare critical for catalysis. Electrostatic interactions can be strong,\neven at relatively long distance.\n20,21 The ternary complex of\nAoIRED has been previously reported, which revealed a binding\nsite for the amine product that placed the chiral carbon within\n4.0 Å of the C4 atom of NADPH.\n9 In addition, studies of enzymes\nsuch as short-chain dehydrogenase, which catalyzes bio-\nreduction using NADPH as a cofactor, reported that hydride\ntransfer could happen when the distance between the NADPH-\nC4 atom and electrophile carbon is# 4.5 Å,\n22–24 and a few of\nthem show moderate imine-reducing activity. 8 Therefore,\nconformations of d1 less than 5.0 Å and d2 less than 4.0 Å were\nconsidered reactive. Based on these two distance criteria, MD\nsimulations of the docking complex demonstrated the high\noccurrence of a reactive conformation in the pro-R pose of the\nprotonated 2-DFPL (Fig. 1C). These ndings suggest that\nnegatively charged acidic residues play a role in promoting the\nformation of reactive pro-R positions during catalysis. There-\nfore, based on the results of site-directed mutagenesis and MD\nsimulations, we inferred that D250 is a crucial residue for\nstereocontrol inPmIR.\nBased on the abovendings, we propose a putative mecha-\nnism for stereocontrol, in which the electrostatic interaction\nbetween the negatively charged side chains of Asp or Glu and\nthe iminium cation governs the orientation of the pyrroline\nface, thereby determining the stereocon guration of the\nproduct. To manipulate the stereoselectivity, we hypothesized\nthat the orientation of the 1-pyrroline face could be reversed by\nsimply introducing new electrostatic interactions in the oppo-\nsite direction, considering that a proton transfer system or any\nanked residues that lower the pK\na value of the proton donor\nare unnecessary. Because the residues at positions 250 and 187\nare adjacent to each other and close to the nicotinamide moiety\nof NADPH, we speculated that replacing Y187 with an acidic\namino acid could create an electrostatic interaction in the\nopposite direction, thereby altering the orientation of the 1-\npyrroline face. The side chains of aspartate and glutamate in the\nmodel compounds, with the titratable residue in the middle\nand two alanines on each side, are determined experimentally\nby previous study in water, yielding pK\na values of 3.6 and 4.2,\nrespectively.25 The protonation state of these residues was taken\ninto consideration to ensure that most of the side chain was\nnegatively charged in the protein. Using a p Ka predicting\nmodule in Discovery Studio 4.0,26 the pKa value of Y187E was\npredicted as 5.4 with a 1.2 shi compared with glutamate in\nwater, and Y187D was predicted as 4.7 with a 1.1 shi compared\nwith aspartate in water, indicating a negative electrostatic\npotential at pH 6.0. As anticipated, the Y187D mutation resulted\nin a dramatically reduced ee to 58%, but a negligible conver-\nsion. The Y187E mutation successfully resulted in slightly\nreversed (S)-stereoselectivity with an ee of 33% (Table 1),\nproviding further evidence for the crucial role of electrostatic\ninteractions in stereoselective control. The docking results were\nin accordance with the proposed stereoselective control mech-\nanism, as a pro-S pose was observed in the Y187E variant\ncomplex using the 2-DFPL iminium as the substrate, showing\nan opposite orientation to the 1-pyrroline face (Fig. 2).\nFig. 2 (A) The chirality of the amine produced by PmIR was deter-\nmined by transferring a hydride ion from NADPH to a prochiral carbon\natom on the speciﬁcC ]N face.

Variant\nstructures that exhibited a higher occurrence of reactive\nconformations were selected for experimental validation,\nthereby reducing the need for laboratory screening (Fig. 3).\nEncouraged by the putative stereoselective control mecha-\nnism and 33% ee observed for the Y187E variant, we used\na complex with the pro-S pose in the reactive conformation from\nMD simulations as the initial structure for the redesign to\nenhance (S)-stereoselectivity and activity simultaneously.

We focused on redesigning the loop residues\nsurrounding 2-DFPL, including V249, D250, and R251 in loops\n242–251, and Q138 and P140 in loops 135–140. Additionally, we\nincluded Q190 in the design because Q190A displayed a higher\nconversion than the WT in previous alanine scanning. The\nhydrophobic region formed by F232, F194, and W195 that\nstabilizes 2-DFPL aromatic ring binding was not selected for\ndesign. A virtual library with 30 000 mutant structures was\ngenerated using the Rosetta Design to explore the sequence and\nconformation space and optimize the catalytic interactions.\nThese structures were then sort based on the Rosetta parame-\nters of Total Score, Constraint Energy, and Interface Energy.\nThe top four non-redundant variants, 5352, 6645, 25 658,\nand PmIR-Re, were further analyzed to determine the occur-\nrence of reactive pro-S conformations using MD simulations.\nExperimental validations were conducted for 5352 andPmIR-\nRe, which showed a relatively high probability of adopting the\npro-S pose in the reactive conformation. Both variants exhibited\nsignicant improvements in stereoselectivity, producing (S)-2-\nDFPD in 93% ee and >99% ee, respectively. Interestingly, the\nD250S and D250M mutations, which resulted in a complete loss\nof activity in the WT, were present in the two active variants,\nsuggesting that E187 replaced D250 to anchor the iminium\ncation. Importantly, this observation further supports the\nhypothesis that the inactivation caused by D250S and D250M in\nthe WT can be attributed to the absence of electrostatic inter-\nactions rather than destabilization of the protein structure.\nThe initial complex used for design demonstrated that the\nlack of tyrosine bulky side chain and electrostatic interaction\nwith Y187E resulted in a lower binding position of the pro-S\npose (Fig. S5†). In contrast, the side-chain repacking of Q190A\nand Q138M in PmIR-Re elevated 2-DFPL binding position,\nFig. 3 Computational reversion ofPmIR stereoselectivity.

The P140M\nside chain could also push substrate into the aromatic region\nand the D250M could form ap–sulphur interaction with 2-DFPL\nfrom above. In addition, the PmIR-Re complex displayed\na geometric feature that more closely resembled the TS struc-\nture than the initial design template, potentially enhancing the\nhydride transfer process (Table S4†). This observation indicates\nthat the increased S-stereoselectivity and activity achieved by\nPmIR-Re could be due to the more reactive conformation for\nhydride transfer while retaining the electrostatic interaction\nwith Y187E. These results further support the idea that the\nstereoselectivity of PmIR can be directly manipulated by\ncreating electrostatic interactions in opposite directions,\nthereby reversing the orientation of the 1-pyrroline face.\nTo the best of our knowledge, only a few studies have inves-\ntigated the stereoselective control mechanisms of imine reduc-\ntion reactions. Several studies have compared IREDs that display\nstereo-complementary activity towards 2-methyl-1-pyrroline and\nhave categorized them into Y-type and D-type IREDs based on\ntheir stereoselectivity and putative catalytic residues (tyrosine or\naspartate).\n6,7 In a recent study by Pleisset al., the stereoselectivity\nof a D-type IRED fromMyxococcus stipitatustowards 2-methyl-1-\npyrroline was reversed.29 They obtained a variant with the oppo-\nsite stereoselectivity and 91% ee through site-saturation muta-\ngenesis. In this case, the stereoselectivity switch was attributed to\nad iﬀerence in the conformation of the nicotinamide moiety of\nNADPH rather than the substrate-binding conformation. More\nrecently, Himo emphasized the importance of steric clashes in\nthe transition-state energy of the pro-R and pro-S complexes of\nAoIRED.\n30 The pro-S conformation, which lacked steric repulsion,\nresulted in a lower energy state and led to (S)-stereoselectivity\ntowards bulky imine substrates. These results suggest that\nvarying the active sites of IREDs oﬀers multiple possibilities for\nne-tuning the relative spatial positions of the imine and nico-\ntinamide groups of the cofactors.\nIn this study, we crossed the boundary between Y-type and D-\ntype IREDs by redesigning Y-typePmIR into a D/E-type enzyme\nwith opposite stereoselectivity. PmIR-Re represents an engi-\nneered IRED with completely reversed stereoselectivity (>99%\nee) achieved through mechanism-guided computational\ndesign. In contrast to the previously reported residues W210 in\nAspRedAm\n31 and W234/F260 in IRED-M5,32 which potentially\naﬀect stereoselectivity by steric hindrance of the bulky side\nchain, the stereoselectivity in PmIR could be controlled by\nelectrostatic interactions between the iminium cation and the\nacidic amino acids adjacent to the nicotinamide moiety of\nNADPH. Therefore, the stereoselectivity of IREDs can be\ntailored through rational reconstruction of electrostatic inter-\nactions and reshaping of the binding pocket.\nEngineering PmIR with interface stabilization\nOnly a few engineered IREDs have been reported to meet\nindustrial requirements, with the complete conversion of\nsubstrates at concentrations exceeding 50 g L\n−1.2,12,33–36 Stability\nis an important factor in determining the overall turnover of\nimine reduction, making IREDs suitable for industrial\nprocesses. IREDs must exhibit high stability and tolerate high\nsubstrate concentrations, organic cosolvents, and high reaction\ntemperatures. Furthermore, evidence suggests that proteins\nthat are stable under one type of denaturing condition tend to\nbe stable under other types.\n37 Therefore, improving the stability\nof naturally occurring IREDs is crucial for industrial applica-\ntions. Recently, directed evolution approaches have been\nemployed to engineerScIR with signicantly increased activity\nand thermal stability towards 2-DFPL.\n35 This resulted in the\ndevelopment of a practical enzymatic process for the produc-\ntion of (R)-2-DFPD. However, extensive screening is inevitable in\ndirected evolution, which increases the cost and time required.\nIn this study, PmIR was engineered to investigate rational\ndesign strategies for the rapid identication of mutations that\nimprove its thermal stability.\nThe PmIR structure is composed of reciprocal homodimers\nconsisting of an N-terminal Rossman fold domain and a C-\nterminal helical domain connected by a long interdomain\nhelix. The two subunits are held together by interacting helices,\nand it is noteworthy that the residues from both subunits\ncontribute to the formation of the binding pocket (Fig. S1†).\nNatural salt bridges were also observed in IREDs on the surface\nbetween the two subunits, providing stability to the dimeric\nstructure.\n38 Based on these observations, we hypothesized that\nenhanced subunit interactions would result in more stable\nvariants. Herein, we employed a comprehensive approach to\nobtain a stable variant,PmIR-6P (P140A/Q190S/R251N/Q217E/\nA257R/T277M), which involved identifying interface mutations\nthrough alanine scanning, designing salt bridges between\ninterfaces, and identifying mutations using DDG\nfold calcula-\ntions (Table 3).\nThe previous alanine scanning revealed that the interface\nresidues P140, Q190, and R251 demonstrated higher conver-\nsions than the WT (Table S2†). Saturation mutagenesis was\nconducted to identify the most benecial mutations at each site.\nAdditive eﬀects of multiple mutations were also investigated\n(Table S5†). As a result, variant P140A/Q190S/R251N showed\na 4.5-fold increase in catalytic eﬃciency with ee exceeding 99%\ncompared to the WT. The puried variant also exhibited aTm of\n57.2 °C, which was 5.1 °C higher than that of the WT. These\nndings are consistent with previous reports on evolved IREDs,\nwhere mutations in the binding pocket not only increased\nactivity, but also improved stability.\n29,31 These dual eﬀects may\nbe attributed to enhanced subunit interactions, resulting in\na more compact active pocket that stabilizes substrate binding.\nBased on the geometric criteria for salt bridges (Fig. S5†) and\nthe crystal structure ofPmIR, potential residue pairs that met\nthe requirements for salt bridge formation were identi ed.\nResidues withB-factors above the average value were selected as\ncandidates for designing salt bridges. A257 and Q217 were\nmutated to A257R and Q217E, respectively, which introduced\na salt bridge between R257 and D87, and between E217 and\nR176. The two new salt bridges increasedT\nm by 1.8 °C and 1.5 °\nC, respectively.\nIn silico saturation mutagenesis was performed for each\nresidue of PmIR, and theDDGfold values were calculated using\n1436 | Chem. Sci.,2 0 2 4 ,15,1 4 3 1–1440 © 2024 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nChemical Science Edge Article\nFoldX and Rosetta_ddg to generate point mutation structures.\nTo narrow down the large number of variants for experimental\nvalidation, we performed MD simulations and visual inspection\non variants below cut-o ﬀ. The variants exhibited reduced\nDDGfold values, lower localexibility than the original residues\n(DZ-score <0), and no obvious structural undesirable mutations\nwere selected for experimental validation (Table S6†). Among\nthe 12 single mutations tested, four variants (G143M, G143W,\nT277M, and T277L) showed higher residual activity than the\ntemplate aer incubation at 60 °C. G143M and T277M, which\nhad higher residual activity, were further puried to determine\ntheir T\nm values (Table 3). Thisin silicoworkow allowed for the\nrapid identication of mutations with a higher likelihood of\nenzyme stabilization and has been successful in several\nbiocatalysts.\n39–41 However, there is a risk that certain mutations\nmay increase stability at the expense of reduced activity.\nAlthough the G143M mutant exhibited a higher T\nm, it also\nshowed a signicant reduction in activity. Therefore, it was not\nincluded in thenal variant. Finally, mutations identied from\nalanine scanning, salt bridge design, andDDGfold prediction\nwere combined, resulting in the highly stable variantPmIR-6P,\nwhich exhibited a 12 °C increase inTm, from 52.1 to 64.1 °C\n(Fig. S9†).\nThe highest specic activity ofPmIR-6P was observed at an\noptimal reaction temperature of 35 °C (Fig. S10A†). At this\ntemperature, the kinetic parameters KM and kcat were deter-\nmined to be 0.92 mM and 2.01 s−1, respectively, showing a 4.7-\nfold increase in catalytic eﬃciency compared with the WT. The\nhalf-lives of both the WT andPmIR-6P variants were measured\nto assess their kinetic stability. At 35 °C,PmIR-6P exhibited an\n8.4-fold improvement in half-life compared to the WT,\nincreasing from 47.5 h to 396.0 h. Furthermore, PmIR-6P\nexhibited a half-life of 280.6 h at 40 °C (Fig. S10B†).\nMD simulations revealed a signi cant diﬀerence in the\nradius of gyration and root mean squareuctuation (RMSF)\nbetween the WT and PmIR-6P at 308 K (35 °C). PmIR-6P\nexhibited a more compact structure, which was attributed to\nmutations at the subunit interface (Fig. 4A). The RMSF of WT\nand PmIR-6P was calculated and compared (Fig. S11†). It indi-\ncated that the most region ofPmIR-6P with a less exibility\nTable 3 Stabilization mutations identiﬁed inPmIR\nMutation Origin Location Tm (°C) DTm (°C) Relative activity a\nWT —— 52.1 0 100 /C60.8\nP140A/Q190S/R251N Alanine scan Interface 57.2 5.1 450.2 /C62.9\nP140A/Q190S/R251N/A257R Salt bridge Interface 59.0 1.8 533.0 /C62.5\nP140A/Q190S/R251N/Q217E Salt bridge Interface 58.7 1.5 418.5 /C61.8\nP140A/Q190S/R251N/G143M DDGfold prediction Surface 58.5 1.3 283.6 /C62.1\nP140A/Q190S/R251N/T277M DDGfold prediction Surface 59.3 2.1 390.3 /C63.8\nPmIR-6P (P140A/Q190S/R251N/Q217E/A257R/T277M) Combination of mutations 64.1 12.0 453.9 /C64.6\na The activity ofPmIR-6P was determined at 35 °C and others were determined at 30 °C.\nFig. 4 (A) Stabilizing mutations included inPmIR-6P are marked in the sphere.

Interestingly, the 242–\n251 binding loop of PmIR -6P was observed with a higher\nmobility than WT, which suggested the loop motion might\naﬀect activity forPmIR.\nThe distance between the backbone Ca atoms of Q217-R176\n(Fig. 4B) and D87-R257 (Fig. 4C) clearly indicate that the salt\nbridges stretched the two subunits more tightly than in the WT.\nThese ndings suggest that subunit dissociation plays a crucial\nrole in the irreversible inactivation of IREDs. This characteristic\nhas also been observed inu-transaminases, where stabilizing\nmutations are predominantly located at the interface of the two\nsubunits as the active pocket is formed there.\n41 Therefore,\nfocusing on the subunit interfaces of IREDs may be eﬀective for\nidentifying stabilizing mutations.\nPreviously reported engineered IREDs were mostly stabilized\nthrough directed evolution involving extensive screening. For\nexample, 256 of 296 amino acid positions of IR-46 fromSac-\ncharothrix espanaensis were subjected to single-site saturation\nmutagenesis and screening before the best variant was identi-\ned.\n36 Similarly, SpRedAm from Streptomyces purpureus was\nengineered to produce cis-cyclobutyl-N-methylamine, with 93\nsites (out of 296) selected for single-site saturation mutagenesis\nand screening.\n34 Additionally, in the case ofScIR fromStrepto-\nmyces clavuligerus, signicantly increased activity and stabili-\nzation were achieved by screening 52 sites.35 These examples\ndemonstrated the power of directed evolution in IRED engi-\nneering. However, a rational design approach that requires\nsignicantly less screening than the conventional directed\nevolution still needs to be developed for IREDs. In this study, we\ncombined diﬀerent computational tools to enhance the thermal\nstability of IREDs and signicantly reduce the library size for\nexperimental testing. Furthermore, our results suggested that\nthe subunit interface, including the binding pocket, plays\na crucial role in stabilizing IREDs.\nComparison of substrate scope\nTo compare the catalytic properties of WT,PmIR-6P, andPmIR-\nRe, their stereoselectivities and activities towards diﬀerent 2-\naryl-substituted pyrrolines were determined (Fig. 5). Higher\nactivity was observed in the reduction of substrates withmeta-\nand ortho-uorine substitutions on the benzene ring. In\ncontrast, low activity was observed for substrates with para-\nsubstitution. The substrate scope was expanded as the WT\nshowed no activity towardpara-uorine-substituted substrates,\nwhereas PmIR-6P displayed measurable activity. Furthermore,\nPmIR-6P exhibited higher activity towards all tested substrates\nthan the WT. The stereoselectivity was strictly maintained as\n(R)-stereoselectivity for all the tested substrates. Engineered\nPmIR-6P is a promising biocatalyst for the production of bulky\nsubstituted pyrrolidines. In contrast,PmIR-Re achieved high (S)-\nstereoselectivity, with an ee exceeding 96% towards all tested\npyrrolidines. It also demonstrated an expanded substrate scope\ncompared with that of the WT. These results indicate that the\ndesigned PmIR-Re exhibited complete (S)-stereoselectivity in\ncatalyzing imine reduction towards various 2-aryl-substituted\npyrrolines.\nGram-scale preparation of ( R)-2-DFPD. To evaluate the\nindustrial potential of the stable variantPmIR-6P, we conducted\na comparative analysis of the asymmetric synthesis of (R)-2-\nDFPD using PmIR-6P and the WT (Fig. 6). The WT achieved\ncomplete conversion within 8 h at a substrate concentration of\nFig. 5 Enzymatic activity and stereoselectivity of WT,PmIR-Re, andPmIR-6P toward diﬀerent 2-aryl-substituted pyrrolines. The relative activity\nof WT was set as 100% in bar charts except for 2-phenyl-1-pyrroline and 5-(4-ﬂuorophenyl)-3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrole which setPmIR-Re as\n100%.\nFig. 6 Reaction curve of WT andPmIR-6P toward diﬀerent substrate\nloadings.\n1438 | Chem.

However, due to its limited activity and stability, only\n81% conversion was achieved when the substrate concentration\nwas increased to 200 mM. In contrast, PmIR-6P achieved\ncomplete conversion of 200 mM substrate within 6 h.PmIR-6P\nalso exhibited its capability to produce valuable (R)-2-DFPD at\n400 mM (72.4 g L−1) with a high ee and complete conversion.\nAer an 8 h reaction on a 100 mL scale, 5.8 g of (R)-2-DFPD was\nobtained with an ee exceeding 99% and an 80% isolated yield.\nThese ndings highlight the potential of engineeredPmIR-6P as\na biocatalyst for the production of larotrectinib intermediates.\nConclusions\nThe putative stereoselective control mechanism proposed in\nthis study enabled the successful reversion of (R)-stereoselective\nPmIR through computational design. The engineered variant,\nPmIR-Re (Q138M/P140M/Y187E/Q190A/D250M/R251N), exhibi-\nted remarkably opposite stereoselectivities, yielding (S)-2-aryl-\nsubstituted pyrrolidines. Through the redesign of Y-typePmIR\ninto a D/E-type variant with opposing stereoselectivity,PmIR-Re\nstands as the rst instance of transcending the boundary\nbetween Y-type and D-type IREDs. The electrostatic interaction\nbetween the iminium cation and negatively charged residues\ncould be crucial for stereocontrol. Furthermore, computational\ndesign of PmIR-Re revealed that, in IREDs, constraining the\nrelative position of the C]N moiety between D/E carboxyl group\nand it between the nicotinamide moiety allows tailoring the pro-\nS or pro-R pose of the substrate using Rosetta applications. This\nenables in silicocustomization of stereoselectivity with reduced\nscreening eﬀorts. Despite the successful revision of stereo-\nselectivity, the practical application ofPmIR in the synthesis of\nchiral amines requires improvement. An approach combining\nthe salt-bridge construction, DDG\nfold calculation, and alanine\nscan was employed to enhance stability. Using this approach,\na six-point mutant, PmIR-6P (P140A/Q190S/R251N/Q217E/\nA257R/T277M), was generated, resulting in a signi cant\nimprovement in stability and an almost 5-fold increase in\nenzymatic activity. ThePmIR-6P exhibited a substantial 12 °C\nincrease in T\nm. The optimized PmIR-6P variant was highly\neﬀective in preparing a key intermediate for larotrectinib\nsynthesis, achieving high substrate loading. This study provides\nvaluable insights into the mechanisms underlying the stereo\ncontrol of IREDs. This also demonstrates the potential of\ncomputational enzyme design to tailor stereochemical\noutcomes and optimize the stability of enzymatic reactions.\nData availability\nThe authors declare that the data supporting thendings of this\nstudy are available in the paper and its ESI Files.† All other data\nare available from the corresponding authors upon reasonable\nrequest.\nAuthor contributions\nK.

Herein, we report a new short chemoen-\nzymatic approach (in 2 steps) towards the synthesis of (R)-selegiline via stereoselective biocatalytic\nreductive amination as the key step. The imine reductase IR36-M5 mutant showed high conversion\n(97%) and stereoselectivity (97%) toward the phenylacetone and propargyl amine substrates, offering\nvaluable biocatalysts for synthesizing alkylated homobenzylic amines.\nKeywords: imine reductase; reductive amination; semi-rational design; homobenzylic amine;\nchemoenzymatic synthesis\n1. Introduction\nChiral amines, one category of the most commonly used chiral blocks in organic\nsynthesis, are the crucial structural units of many pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, fine\nchemicals, polymers, dyes, pigments, etc. [ 1]. Within the ample and diverse range of\noptically pure amines, homobenzylic amine derivatives are much sought-after structural\nmotifs found in a wide variety of market-approved active pharmaceutical ingredients\n(APIs) and bioactive molecules. The former drug candidates of ( R)-selegiline [2–6], ben-\nzphetamine [7,8], and lisdexamfetamine (Figure 1) are representative examples of these\ncompounds [9]. (R)-Selegiline, as a pharmaceutical substance belonging to this category, is\ncommonly used in clinical practice to reduce the symptoms of early-stage Parkinson’s dis-\nease. The pharmacological effect of (R)-selegiline is that it works as a selective irreversible\nMAO-B inhibitor slowing the breakdown of certain natural substances in the brain (e.g.,\ndopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin). (R)-Selegiline is usually used in combination\nwith L-DOPA or carbidopa and can also be used for the treatment of depression and senile\ndementia [2–6].\nMolecules 2024, 29, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 12 \n \n \nco-workers employed Evans’ electrophilic azidation of chiral imide enolates as the key \nchiral-inducing step to synthesize (R)-selegiline in high enantioselectivity (97%, R) (Figure \n2A) [18]. In 2021, Lavandera and co -workers employed amine transaminase (ATA) as a \nbiocatalyst to synthesize ( R)- and (S)-homobenzylic amines in 81% yield (>99%, R) and \n80% yield (>99%, S), respectively [19]. However, it further required an extra 2 steps for \nalkylation of the primary amine for the synthesis of ( R)-selegiline. Herein, we developed \nan engineered IR36-M5 catalyzed reductive amination approach to access the key inter-\nmediate (R)-desmethylselegiline, 1a (Figure 2B).  \n \nFigure 1.

The synthesis of ( R)-selegiline has been reported through different strategies in\nrecent years. Racemic approaches [ 10,11], chiral pool starting materials, asymmetric hy-\ndrogenation, classical/kinetic resolutions [12,13], regioselective aziridine ring openings\nwith organocuprates [14], OsO4-catalyzed asymmetric dihydroxylations [15], and proline\nbased functionalization of aldehydes [ 16] are the most reported synthetic strategies of\n(R)-selegiline. In 2014, Pramanik and co-workers reported a deoxygenation of the pseu-\ndoephedrine approach to prepare ( R)-selegiline (Figure 2A) [ 17]. In the following year,\nSudalai and co-workers employed Evans’ electrophilic azidation of chiral imide enolates as\nthe key chiral-inducing step to synthesize (R)-selegiline in high enantioselectivity (97%, R)\n(Figure 2A) [18]. In 2021, Lavandera and co-workers employed amine transaminase (ATA)\nas a biocatalyst to synthesize (R)- and (S)-homobenzylic amines in 81% yield (>99%, R) and\n80% yield (>99%, S), respectively [19].

Biocatalytic reductive amination using IREDs\nhas led to commercial manufacturing. For example, engineered IREDs have been used in\nthe large-scale production of the LSD1 inhibitor GSK2879552 [35] and the JAK1 inhibitor\nabrocitinib [36].\nIn our previous research, we successfully developed the IR36-M5 mutant capable of\ncatalyzing reactions involving piperidines and azepane alkylamines while also enhancing\nand reversing stereocenters [37,38]. Specifically, when utilizing propargylamine a as the\ndonor, both pyrrolidinone and oxo-azepane exhibited outstanding R-stereoselectivity,\nachieving 98% and 99% ee values, respectively. However, when dealing with a piperidinone\nsubstrate, IR36-M5 displayed an excellent conversion rate of 99%, but the stereoselectivity\nwas relatively lower at 56% ( R) (Figure 3). These findings prompted us to explore the\npotential of this mutant further through a semi-rational design for synthesizing linear\nsubstrate, (R)-desmethylselegiline 1a, a crucial intermediate in the (R)-selegiline molecule\n(Figure 3). When using phenylacetone 1 and propargylamine a as the ketone and amine\ndonors, IRED variants exhibited limited stereoselectivity. In contrast, IR36-M5 displayed\nhigh stereoselectivity when applied to the phenylacetone 1 and propargylamine a substrate\ncombination (Table 1).

Consequently, we \nopted to utilize IR36 -M5 as our initial enzyme to test our model study. As depict ed in \nTable 1, the IR36-M5 mutant displayed significant stereoselectivity, reaching 97% in the R \nconfiguration toward substrate 1. We also tested several M5 mutants (M5 -F260D, M5 -\nF260E, M5-F260N, M5-W234L, and M5-W234I), which exhibited excellent stereoselective \ncontrol in our  pyrrolizidine alkylamine synthesis  [38]. Most of these mutants exhibited \nrelatively low to moderate enantioselectivity ranging from 52% to 85% (R) ee values. Dis-\nappointingly, the results show that these M5 mutants are not ideal biocatalysts to synthe-\nsize the key intermediate (R)-desmethylselegiline 1a. \nTo identify potential ideal mutation sites, we conducted molecular docking of the \nimine intermediate 1a′ into the crystal structure of M5 (PDB: 7WNW) using Discovery \nStudio 2019. Our analysis revealed that seven amino acids, namely , F260, L200, M203, \nY204, W234, H264, and G268, directly interacted with the phenylacetone 1 moiety (Figure \n4). To further explore the effects of these sites on stereoselectivity, we conducted single -\nsite saturation mutagenesis experiments on M5 at these seven amino acid positions . As \nillustrated in Figures 5 and S1–S3, we observed that when the residue M203 was replaced \nby amino acids possessing smaller side chains, the resulting mutants displayed improved \nR-selectivity (Figure 5A and Table S2).

Docking the intermediate of reductive amination of 1 and a into the M5 (PDB: 7WNW) \nactive cavity. \nIn the positions of 264 (Figure 5C and Table S4) and 234 (Figure S3 and Table S8), \nmost of the mutants displayed R-selectivity in moderate to good levels of R-selectivity. \nNotably, the mutant H264N exhibited significant enhancement in R-selectivity, achieving \nup to 98% ee value. In our previous study, F260 and W234 played pivotal roles in deter-\nmining stereoselectivity when dealing with azacycloamines. In this case, when the residue \nat position F260 was replaced with a larger side-chain amino acid, the product exhibited \nhigh R-stereoselectivity (Figure 5B and Table S3). However, for positively charged and \npolar uncharged amino acids with larger side chains, the enzyme loses the catalytic activ-\nity. The result confirmed that the residue at position F260 played a pivotal role in biocat-\nalytic reductive amination reactions. Similarly, in the case of G268, R-selectivity was pre-\nferred in asymmetric reductive amination involving the phenylacetone 1 substrate and the \nmutant G268H exhibited significant enhancement in R-selectivity, achieving up to 98% ee \nvalue. When the residues were replaced by Lys and Arg, both positively charged amino \nacids, the M5 variants lost their catalytic activity (Figure 5D and Table S5). Based on these \nfindings, it is reasonable to speculate that the positions of 203, 243, 260, and 264 are crucial \nfor the R-selectivity of IR36-M5, convincing the molecular docking predictions. \nRegarding the position of L200, when we replaced the amino acid with His, Lys, Pro, \nArg, Trp, or Tyr, we observed a complete loss of catalytic activity toward the model sub-\nstrates (Figure S1 and Table S6). This means that most mutations in the L200 amino acid \nsite lead to enzyme inactivation out of the seven amino acid sites. These results indicate \nthat the L200 amino acid site is highly conserved. Conversely, when residue L200 was \nsubstituted with Met, Asn, Ile, and Val, w e observed R-selectivity with good levels of ee \nvalues, reaching 95%, 89%, 86%, and 86%, respectively. This indicates that specific amino \nacid substitutions at position L200 can lead to improved R-selectivity while maintaining \ncatalytic activity. The results are also consistent with the molecular docking prediction \nthat residue L200 interacts very directly with the phenylacetone 1 moiety (Figure 4). At \nposition 204, we also observed good R-selectivity with ee values reaching up to 94% (Fig-\nure S2 and Table S7). \nAmong all the single-site mutation variants in this study, five IR36-M5 mutants dis-\nplayed 98% R-selectivity, specifically M203E, M203Q, F260M, H264N, and G268H, in com-\nparison to IR36 -M5 (97%, R). To assess the potential of IR36 -M5 and its variants in the \nsynthesis of (R)-desmethylselegiline 1a, we further evaluated their conversion ratios for \nphenylacetone 1 (Table S9). Notably, IR36-M5 demonstrated excellent conversion, achiev-\ning 97% conversion (Table S9 Entry 1). However, the other five IR36-M5 mutants with 98% \n(R) ee values showed relatively poor to moderate conversions as follows: Entry 2, M203—\n34% conversion; Entry 3, M203Q—42% conversion; Entry 4, F260M—9% conversion; En-\ntry 5, H264N—58% conversion; and Entry 6, G268H—65% conversion. \nFigure 4.

Notably,\nthe mutant H264N exhibited significant enhancement in R-selectivity, achieving up to\n98% ee value. In our previous study, F260 and W234 played pivotal roles in determining\nstereoselectivity when dealing with azacycloamines. In this case, when the residue at\nposition F260 was replaced with a larger side-chain amino acid, the product exhibited\nhigh R-stereoselectivity (Figure 5B and Table S3). However, for positively charged and\npolar uncharged amino acids with larger side chains, the enzyme loses the catalytic activity.\nMolecules 2024, 29, 1328 6 of 12\nThe result confirmed that the residue at position F260 played a pivotal role in biocatalytic\nreductive amination reactions. Similarly, in the case of G268, R-selectivity was preferred in\nasymmetric reductive amination involving the phenylacetone 1 substrate and the mutant\nG268H exhibited significant enhancement in R-selectivity, achieving up to 98% ee value.\nWhen the residues were replaced by Lys and Arg, both positively charged amino acids, the\nM5 variants lost their catalytic activity (Figure 5D and Table S5). Based on these findings,\nit is reasonable to speculate that the positions of 203, 243, 260, and 264 are crucial for the\nR-selectivity of IR36-M5, convincing the molecular docking predictions.\nRegarding the position of L200, when we replaced the amino acid with His, Lys,\nPro, Arg, Trp, or Tyr, we observed a complete loss of catalytic activity toward the model\nsubstrates (Figure S1 and Table S6). This means that most mutations in the L200 amino acid\nsite lead to enzyme inactivation out of the seven amino acid sites. These results indicate\nthat the L200 amino acid site is highly conserved. Conversely, when residue L200 was\nsubstituted with Met, Asn, Ile, and Val, we observed R-selectivity with good levels of ee\nvalues, reaching 95%, 89%, 86%, and 86%, respectively. This indicates that specific amino\nacid substitutions at position L200 can lead to improved R-selectivity while maintaining\ncatalytic activity. The results are also consistent with the molecular docking prediction that\nresidue L200 interacts very directly with the phenylacetone 1 moiety (Figure 4). At position\n204, we also observed good R-selectivity with ee values reaching up to 94% (Figure S2 and\nTable S7).\nAmong all the single-site mutation variants in this study, five IR36-M5 mutants dis-\nplayed 98% R-selectivity, specifically M203E, M203Q, F260M, H264N, and G268H, in\ncomparison to IR36-M5 (97%, R).

Biotransformation Using Cell-Free Extract\nCell-free extracts of IR36-M5 and its mutant proteins were used to measure the con-\nversion and enantioselectivity for ketone 1 and amine a. A typical 10 mL reaction mixture\ncontained cell-free extract (10 g/L wet cells weight), 1 mM NADP+, 30 mM phenylacetone 1,\npropargylamine a (2 eq, stock solution was adjusted to pH 7.0), D-glucose (2 eq), 1 mg/mL\nGDH, and DMSO (10% v/v) in sodium phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 7.0).

The\nabove-mentioned samples were analyzed by Waters 2695 Separation Module and Wates\n2996 Photodiode Array Detector with gradient method (1.0 mL/min, 20 min, H2O/MeCN,\n90/10→10/90, v/v) using C18 analytic column (Phenomenex Gemini, 4.6 × 250 mm, 5 µm,\nPhenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA).\nMolecules 2024, 29, 1328 10 of 12\nChiral HPLC analysis was performed to analyze the ee values of racemic amine stan-\ndards, chiral amine standards, and biotransformation products for 1a with chiral columns\nand different solvent ratios of ethanol containing 0.02% diethylamine and n-hexane.\n3.9. Molecular Docking\nIn this study, the previously reported crystal structure of IR36-M5 (7WNW), which is a\ncomplex with NADP+, is used as the receptor target. The structures of M5 are generated by\nusing the standard mutation protocol of Discovery Studio 2019 Client. Flexible docking of\nthe imine intermediate of phenylacetone 1 and propargylamine a into M5 was performed\nusing a flexible docking protocol. Docking runs were carried out using the standard\nparameters, and the conformations with the lowest energy were chosen for analysis of the\nsubstrate–enzyme interactions.\n4. Conclusions\nIn summary, we have identified five mutants (M203E, M203Q, F260M, H264N, and\nG268H), which displayed higher R-selectivity (98%, ee), although their conversion rates\nwere low. Balancing both selectivity and conversion efficiency, the M5 mutant was chosen\nas the biocatalyst for synthesizing (R)-desmethylselegiline 1a, a crucial intermediate for\n(R)-selegiline, a Parkinson’s disease therapy. The chemoenzymatic total synthesis of (R)-\nselegiline was successfully achieved in two steps, demonstrating good enantioselectivity\n(97%, R) and conversion (97%). This outcome highlights the potential of IR36-M5 in the\nreductive amination of homobenzylic ketones for producing chiral amines, emphasizing\nM5’s advantages in developing pharmaceuticals containing homobenzylic amines. Ongo-\ning efforts in our lab focus on further optimizing M5 mutants to enhance stereoselectivity\nand conversion, with findings to be reported in due course.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at https:\n//www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules29061328/s1: Sequence of IR36-M5; Table S1: List\nof primers in this study; Table S2: Enantioselectivity of the mutants generated by site-saturation\nmutagenesis of residue M203 over M5; Table S3: Enantioselectivity of the mutants generated by\nsite-saturation mutagenesis of residue F260 over M5; Table S4: Enantioselectivity of the mutants\ngenerated by site-saturation mutagenesis of residue H264 over M5; Table S5: Enantioselectivity of the\nmutants generated by site-saturation mutagenesis of residue G268 over M5; Table S6: Enantioselec-\ntivity of the mutants generated by site-saturation mutagenesis of residue L200 over M5; Figure S1:\nEnantioselectivity of IR36-M5 and its mutants at sites L200, respectively; Table S7: Enantioselectivity\nof the mutants generated by site-saturation mutagenesis of residue Y204 over M5; Figure S2: Enan-\ntioselectivity of IR36-M5 and its mutants at sites Y204, respectively; Table S8: Enantioselectivity of\nthe mutants generated by site-saturation mutagenesis of residue W234 over M5; Figure S3: Enan-\ntioselectivity of IR36-M5 and its mutants at sites 234, respectively; Table S9: Conversion rates and\nstereoselectivities of IRED mutants towards 1a; Figure S4: Chiral HPLC analysis of racemic standard\nof 1a and chiral amine standards of 1a, M5 catalytic product 1a; Figure S5: The 1H NMR spectrum of\n1a in chloroform-d4 (400 MHz); Figure S6: The 13C NMR spectrum of 1a in chloroform-d4 (100 MHz);\nFigure S7: The 1H NMR spectrum of (R)-Selegiline in chloroform-d4 (400 MHz); Figure S8: The 13C\nNMR spectrum of (R)-Selegiline in chloroform-d4 (100 MHz).\nAuthor Contributions: Y.H., J.B. and D.T. performed and analyzed experiments.

However, the existing methods typically rely on chemical approaches to diversify \nthe N-group modification of Ephedra-type alkaloids. Herein, we report a 2-step enzymatic assembly line \nfor creating structurally diverse Ephedra-type alkaloids to replace the conventional chemical modification \nsteps. We first identified a new carboligase from Bacillus subtilis (BsAlsS, acetolactate synthase) as a robust \ncatalyst to yield different phenylacetylcarbinol (PAC) analogs from diverse aromatic aldehydes with near 100% \nconversions. Subsequently, we screened imine reductases (IREDs) for the reductive amination of PAC analogs. \nIt was found that IRG02 from Streptomyces albidoflavus had good activities with conversions ranging from 37% \nto 84% for the reductive alkylamination with diverse amine partners such as allylamine, propargylamine, and \ncyclopropylamine. Overall, 3 new bio-modifications at the N-group of Ephedra-type alkaloids were established. \nT aken together, our work lays a foundation for the future implementation of biocatalysis for synthesizing \nstructurally diverse Ephedra-type alkaloids with potential new pharmaceutical applications.\nIntroduction\nEphedra-type alkaloids are naturally produced by Catha edulis \nand members of the genus Ephedra [1,2]. This class of alkaloids \nrun a gamut of pharmacologic activities such as the bronchodila-\ntor and adrenergic receptor agonists [3–5] for treating bronchial \nasthma and low blood pressure [6]. Plant extraction methods \nare commonly used to obtain natural Ephedra-type alkaloids. \nHowever, due to the limited applications of natural Ephedra-\ntype alkaloid, there is current interest in producing synthetic \nEphedra-type alkaloids with improved pharmacological proper-\nties and reduced side effects [7]. Researchers have created non-\nnatural Ephedra-type alkaloids with diverse functionalization \nby chemical or biocatalytic approaches. The structural modifica-\ntions on the phenyl ring and the N-group are commonly imple-\nmented to create synthetic Ephedra-type alkaloids with changed \npharmacologic activities [8,9]. For instance, butaxamine with \nthe N-group modification is used as a selective β2-adrenoceptor \nantagonist [10]. Methoxamine (a potential candidate as a vaso-\npressor [11]) and metaraminol (the prevention and treatment \nof acute hypotension [12,13]) are 2 representative synthetic alka-\nloids with modifications at the phenyl ring.\nIn plants, (pseudo)ephedrines are synthesized from the pre-\ncursor of 1-phenylpropane-1,2-dione by the condensation of \nthe benzylic fragment with pyruvate [14], which is further \nmodified by transamination and N-alkylation. Although it is \nimportant to elucidate the natural biosynthetic pathway for \nEphedra alkaloids, the structural diversity from the natural \npathway is only limited to a few types of compounds. Instead, \nsynthetic Ephedra-type alkaloids were reported to provide sym-\npathomimetic drugs and chemical synthons [15], and it is desir-\nable to generate more structurally diverse Ephedra-type alkaloids \nwith potential novel pharmaceutical activities. However, current \nefforts of using biological approaches mainly have focused on \ngenerating the diversity on the phenyl ring using different aromatic \naldehydes as starting substrates [16,17]. There is plenty of scope \nfor diversifying the N-group of Ephedra-type alkaloids [18].\nFor the creation of different synthetic Ephedra-type alka-\nloids, chemical strategies involve the use of toxic reagents, long \nreaction procedures, and isolation [19–21], which are not envi-\nronmentally friendly processes. In addition, different group \nmodifications require distinct synthetic routes, which would \nlimit its diversified synthesis [22,23]. Biological approaches have \nbeen developed to synthesize synthetic and natural Ephedra-\ntype alkaloids. The early biocatalytic methods focused on modi-\nfying the phenyl ring to produce different nor(pseudo)ephedrine \nanalogs (Fig. 1A). For instance, Rother et al. reported the syn-\nthesis of 4 nor(pseudo)ephedrine isomers by combining car -\nboligases such as pyruvate decarboxylases (PDCs) [24] and \nacetohydroxyacid synthases (AHASs) [25] and transaminases \n(TAs) with different enantioselectivities [17,26]. Based on the \npromiscuity of these enzymes, these enzymatic cascades were \nCitation: Wu P , Luo D, Wang Y, \nShang X, Wang B, Deng X, Yuan J. \nBiosynthesis of Diverse Ephedra-\nT ype Alkaloids via a Newly Identified \nEnzymatic Cascade.

For the N-functionalization, S-adenosylmethionine \n(SAM)-dependent methyltransferases (PNMTs) [27] have been \nreported to catalyze the N-methylation of nor(pseudo)ephed-\nrine. However, other N-modifications of nor(pseudo)ephedrine \nhave to rely on chemical approaches (Fig. 1A), which require \nthe use of toxic metal catalysts and large amounts of organic \nsolvents [28].\nTo overcome the limitations of phenyl-ring modification and \nN-functionalization of non-natural Ephedra-type alkaloids, we \naimed to develop a more concise 2-step enzymatic assembly \nline to create diverse Ephedra-type alkaloids, which eliminates \ntoxic chemical approaches (Fig. 1B). We first identified that \nacetolactate synthase from Bacillus subtilis (BsAlsS) exhibited \na superior substrate scope for the carboligation of diverse aro-\nmatic aldehydes with pyruvate. To address the limitation of \nbiological N-alkylamination, we screened and identified an \nimine reductase (IRED) from Streptomyces albidoflavus for one-\nstep reductive alkylamination with different amine donors. \nOverall, we successfully synthesized 16 phenylacetylcarbinol \n(PAC)-class α-hydroxyketones with good yields and demon-\nstrated 3 new bio-modifications at the N-group of Ephedra-type \nalkaloids. Taken together, we successfully explored the biologi-\ncal approach to expand the structural diversity of synthetic \nEphedra-type alkaloids, which will provide new drug candidates \nwith potential pharmaceutical applications.\nMaterials and Methods\nStrains and reagents\nEscherichia coli strain DH5α was used for plasmid construc-\ntions.

The \noptical density of cell culture was measured by BioTek Synergy \nH1 Reader (BioTek, USA).\nProtein purified procedure: E. coli cells were harvested at \n7,000 rpm for 5 min and the pellets were resuspended in the \nbuffer containing 1.25% K2HPO4, 0.23% KH2PO4, 2.93% NaCl, \n0.07% imidazole, and 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride. \nThe cell lysis was performed by ultrasonication (3 s ON, 3 s \nOFF , 70 cycles), and the supernatant was collected by centrifu-\ngation at 4 °C, 10,000 rpm for 10 min. After filtering the super-\nnatant by 0.45-μm filter, the cell lysate was loaded into gravity \nflow columns charged with 5 ml of Ni-NTA agarose and eluted \nby the buffer containing 500 mM NaCl and 20 to 200 mM \nimidazole. The concentration of purified protein was deter -\nmined by the Bradford protein assay kit. The purity of proteins \nwas analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel \nelectrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). Further removing salt ions and \nimidazole was carried out by dialysis.\nBiotransformation procedure\nFor the whole-cell biocatalyst, cells were harvested at a speed \nof 7,000 rpm for 5 min. Cell pellets were washed once with \ndistilled water and resuspended to a final concentration of 30 or \n60 g/l cell dry weight (CDW) in potassium phosphate (KP) \nbuffer (pH 7.0, 100 mM). Biotransformation was conducted \nwith either whole-cell catalysts or purified enzymes. The whole-\ncell biotransformation was typically performed in a 1-ml reaction \nmixture, the purified enzyme-catalyzed reaction was performed \nin a 0.5-ml reaction mixture, and the scale-up preparation was \nperformed in a 30-ml reaction mixture.\nFor the carboligase-mediated condensation reaction, 1 ml \nof reaction mixture consists of 5 to 30 mM aromatic aldehyde, \n10 to 60 mM pyruvate (the ratio of aldehyde to pyruvate was \nkept at 1:2), 20 g/l d-glucose, 10 g/l CDW whole-cell biocatalysts, \n0.5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT), 60 mM KCl, 5 mM MgCl2·6H2O, \nand 0.1 mM thiamine pyrophosphate (ThDP), in 1 ml of KP \nbuffer (pH 7.0, 100 mM). Reactions were incubated at 30 °C \nwith a shaking speed of 250 rpm for 24 h. For purified enzyme-\nmediated reaction, a 0.5-ml reaction mixture was prepared in \na similar way with an equivalent of enzyme. For the scale-up \npreparation of α-hydroxyketones, 30 ml of reaction mixtures \nwas prepared in a similar way to 1 ml of the reaction mixture \nas mentioned above with 20 mM aromatic aldehyde and 40 mM \npyruvate. Substrates a and b were performed with 30 mM, and \nsubstrates h, j, k, and p were performed with 10 mM.\nIRED-mediated N-alkylamination of α-hydroxyketone\nPAC (1a) was used as the model substrate to screen suitable \nIREDs. The biotransformation contains 20 g/l d-glucose, 5 mM \nPAC, the corresponding amines donors, and 20 g/l CDW \nwhole-cell biocatalysts coexpressing IRED and BmGDH, \nin 1 ml of KP buffer (pH 7.0, 100 mM). Reaction mixtures \nwere incubated at 30 °C with a shaking speed of 250 rpm for \n24 h. For IRG02-catalyzed reductive N-alkylamination of PAC \nanalogs, the reaction mixture contains 5 mM PAC-class \nα-hydroxyketones, 20 g/l d -glucose, 20 g/l CDW whole-cell \ncatalysts with IRG02 and BmGDH, and the appropriate ratio \nof amine donors, in 1 ml of KP buffer (pH 7.0, 100 mM). The \nreaction mixtures were incubated at 30 °C with a shaking speed \nof 250 rpm for 24 h.\nOne-pot biocatalysis procedure\nFor the one-pot concurrent synthesis of Ephedra-type alka-\nloids, the reaction mixture comprises 5 to 30 mM aldehyde, \n10 to 60 mM pyruvate, the appropriate ratio of amine donors, \n20 g/l d-glucose, 20 g/l CDW whole-cell catalysts (expressing \nBsAlsS, IRG02, and Bm GDH), 0.5 mM DTT, 60 mM KCl, \n5 mM MgCl 2·6H2O, and 0.1 mM ThDP , in 1 ml of KP buffer \n(pH 7.0, 100 mM). The reaction mixtures were incubated at \n30 °C with a shaking speed of 250 rpm for 24 h. For the one-\npot sequential step, the reaction mixtures were carried out \nin a similar way to the one-pot concurrent step without the \nsupplementation of amine donors. The reaction mixtures were \nincubated at 30 °C with a shaking speed of 250 rpm for 4 h \nto perform the BsAlsS-mediated carboligation. Subsequently, \nan appropriate ratio of amine donor was added to make up \nto 1 ml of reaction volume, and the IRED-mediated reduc -\ntive N-alkylamination was continued for another 20 h.\nHPLC and MS/MS analysis\nFor product analysis, 50 μl of the sample was diluted with appro-\npriate amounts of 10% acetonitrile (ACN) solution and centri-\nfuged at 14,000 rpm for 10 min to remove the cell pellet. The \nsupernatant was analyzed by high-performance liquid chroma-\ntography (HPLC). HPLC analysis was performed using Shimadzu \nProminence LC-20AD system with a C18 reversed-phase column \n(Shim-pack GIST C18-AQ, 5 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm). Different ratios \nof ACN and ultrapure water with 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) \nwere used as the mobile phase. The flow rate was set at 1 ml/min, \nand the column temperature was maintained at 40 °C. Both stan-\ndards and samples were determined using the detection wave-\nlength at 210 nm. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) analysis \nwas performed on the TripleTOF 5600+ System. Ions with an \nintensity higher than 2.0 × 104 counts were fragmented by MS/\nMS fragmentation with the resolution set to 60,000, AGC (auto-\nmatic gain control) target to 3.0 × 104, maximum injection time \nto 50 ms, and HCD (higher-energy C trap dissociation) collision \nenergy (%) to 30. Ions were excluded from further fragmentation \nif they occurred more than once in 60 s.\nDocking analysis\nDocking procedures are executed using GNINA software. The \nAB chains of BsAlsS, the AC chains of EcIlvBN, and the AB \nchains of 2VJY are selected for superposition to identify the \nreactive pocket. Only one pocket is retained for downstream \nanalyses. ThDP within the AB chains of BsAlsS and the AC \nchains of EcIlvBN is manually modified to hydroxyethylThDP \n(HEThDP). The coordinates of pyruvate near the ThDP of the \nAC chain in 2VJY serve as a reference point for the ligand \n4-hydroxybenzaldehyde, and a box with a 4-Å radius around \npyruvate is utilized for docking. Each docking iteration pro-\nduces 100 poses, with an exhaustive sampling value set to 50. \nPoses are selected based on a combination of high-scoring \nranks and appropriate reaction distances for binding conforma-\ntions. For the docking results of BsAlsS with 4-hydroxybenz-\naldehyde, the pose with the second-highest convolutional \nneural networks (CNN) score is chosen for analysis (reaction \ndistance is 3.5 Å, CNN pose score =  0.9094, CNN affinity = \n3.690). For the docking results of EcIlvBN with 4-hydroxy-\nbenzaldehyde, the pose with the highest CNN score is \nselected for analysis (reaction distance is 4.2 Å, CNN \npose score = 0.8442, CNN affinity = 3.985). Interactions are visu-\nalized using PyMOL software.\nWu et al. 2024 | https://doi.org/10.34133/bdr.0048 4\nResults and Discussion\nIdentification of acetolactate synthase from  \nB. subtilis for PAC production\nCarboligation of substituted aromatic aldehydes and pyruvate \ngenerates α-hydroxyketones, which serve as intermediates to \nproduce natural and synthetic Ephedra-type alkaloids. To \nincrease the diversity at the phenyl ring, the pivotal goal is \nto identify a highly active carboligase with a broad substrate \nscope. The family of ThDP-dependent lyases catalyzes a broad \nrange of C–C formation and cleavage reactions. PDCs and \nAHASs have been extensively explored for biomanufacturing \nPAC and its analogs [25,31–33]. Compared to the PDC-\nmediated carboligation that results in acetaldehyde as a by-\nproduct, AHASs have a clear advantage in their intrinsic \ncarboligation without such by-product [25]. To date, EcIlvBN \nfrom E. coli that contains a large subunit IlvB and a small \nregulatory subunit IlvN represents one of the most commonly \nused AHASs for PAC production [11,13]. Considering that \nBsAlsS has been extensively applied to the production of \nbranched-chain amino acid-derived chemicals including iso -\nbutanol [34,35], it is likely that BsAlsS might have the carbo -\nligation activity for condensing benzaldehyde and pyruvate \nto generate L-PAC. However, catabolic acetolactate synthase \n(CALS) [36,37] such as BsAlsS from B. subtilis  is rarely stud-\nied for PAC production.\nAs depicted in Fig. 2A, ThDP-dependent carboligases \ntypically share the same catalytic cycle for the condensation \nof aromatic aldehydes with pyruvate [38,39]. The bound ThDP \nanion reacts with pyruvate to form lactylThDP (LThDP), \nwhich undergoes decarboxylation to form HEThDP . In the \npresence of benzaldehyde, the HEThDP intermediate can \nreact with benzaldehyde to form a bound arylacetyl carbinol, \nwhich is further released as PAC. In this study, molecular \ndocking was first applied to compare the active sites of BsAlsS \n[Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID: 4RJJ] with EcIlvBN (PDB ID: \n6LPI). Notably, both BsAlsS and the catalytic unit of EcIlvBN \nshare a similar substrate binding pocket (Fig. 2B), suggesting \nthe potential implementability of BsAlsS for condensing \nbenzaldehyde with pyruvate. Additionally, we performed \nmolecular docking simulations with another bulky substrate \nof 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde. As shown in Fig. 2C, aromatic \nrings of residues Tyr 481 and Phe 456 in BsAlsS are likely to \nguide the substrate HEThDP into a more stable position. The \nMet residue at position 483 from BsAlsS is smaller, conferring \ngreater substrate tolerance. More interestingly, the residue \nMet483 in BsAlsS may act as a hydrogen bond acceptor, form-\ning bonds with the OH group on the substrate. These robust \ninteractions may allow 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde to bind near \nthe substrate HEThDP at an optimal reaction distance of \n3.5 Å (Fig. 2C). In comparison, Leu 476 in EcIlvBN is a larger \namino acid than Met 483 in BsAlsS, and this size difference \ncan lead to steric hindrance, potentially affecting the binding \nof bulky aromatic substrates.\nTo experimentally validate the activity of BsAlsS, both benz-\naldehyde (BAL; a) and 4-hydroxy benzaldehyde (4-HBAL; b) \nwere tested as the substrates. As shown in Fig. 2D, the holoen-\nzyme EcIlvBN converted 20 mM BAL a to 13 mM PAC 1a (~65% \nconversion). 4-HBAL b (10 mM) gave 8 mM 4-hydroxy PAC 1b \nby EcIlvBN, but the activity of EcIlvBN was completely abolished \nat 20 mM 4-HBAL b . Encouragingly, BsAlsS exhibited a high \ncatalytic activity toward substrates a and b, and both a and b \nwere fully converted to products 1a and 1b within 4 h. As BsAlsS \nis a FAD-independent enzyme, we noticed that the cell pellet of \nBsAlsS-expressing E. coli gave a different color when compared \nto that of EcIlvBN-expressing E. coli (Fig. S1). Further validation \nof the whole-cell biocatalysts by SDS-PAGE confirmed the suc-\ncessful overexpression of MR-BsAlsS and MR-EcIlvBN (Fig. 2E). \nFurthermore, we conducted a comparative analysis of the bio-\ncatalytic efficiency between the whole-cell biocatalyst and the \npurified BsAlsS. The results revealed that the whole-cell biocata-\nlyst exhibited a comparable activity to that of the purified enzyme \n(Fig. S3). For substrate a, we observed a slightly higher biocata-\nlytic efficiency of the whole-cell biocatalyst compared to that of \nthe purified BsAlsS. However, a lower conversion of substrate b \nin whole-cell biocatalysis compared to that of the purified BsAlsS \nwas observed (Fig. S3). We reasoned that substrate b  might \nexhibit a reduced permeability across the cell membrane barrier \nin the whole-cell biocatalysis due to the presence of an additional \nhydroxy group. Nevertheless, considering that whole-cell bioca-\ntalysis could substantially reduce the operating cost when com-\npared to purified enzymes, it is more feasible for the future \nscale-up of bioproduction processes.\nBroad substrate scope of BsAlsS for synthesis of \ndiverse α-hydroxyketones\nAfter obtaining the encouraging results from BsAlsS, we \nattempted to further assess its catalytic activity on various sub-\nstituted aromatic aldehydes. As listed in Fig. 3, a set of sub-\nstrates c to p with different substitutions of hydroxy, methoxy, \nand halogen at ortho , meta, and para positions of the phenyl \nring were selected. All reactions proceeded with ~100% conver-\nsions under 5 mM c  to p (data not shown). Even at the con-\ncentration of 20 mM c to p, the majority of products 1c to 1p \nwere obtained at good yields, as calculated by liquid chroma-\ntography analysis (Fig. S4) and structurally validated by mass \nspectrum analysis (Fig. S12). For instance, substrates c, d, g, i, \nl, m, n, and o afforded products 1c, 1d, 1g, 1i, 1l, 1m, 1n, and \n1o with excellent >99% conversions. Substrates e, f, h, k, and \nj gave products 1e, 1f, 1h, 1k, and 1j with efficiencies ranging \nfrom 50 to 92%. Substrate p was poorly transformed when the \nconcentration was over 10 mM, and 20 mM substrate p  only \ngave 1p at 16% conversion, indicating that the combined ortho- \nand meta-methoxy functionalization might hinder the sub-\nstrate binding to BsAlsS.\nSome trends could be observed from the conversion profile: \naromatic aldehydes substituted with hydroxyl group in the \northo , meta, and para  position ( 1b, 1g, 1l) provided high \nconversions; halogen modifications showed that fluorine-\nsubstituted substrates ( 1d, 1i ) are more active than those \nwith chlorine and bromine modifications (1e, 1f, 1j, 1k), prob-\nably because the smaller size of side group [40,41] can make \nthe substrates easily interact with the active site of BsAlsS. The \npara functionalization provided higher conversions than the \northo modification (1b to 1f versus 1g to 1k). Excellent conver-\nsions were achieved by combining para- with ortho-modifications \n(2 hydroxyls 1n, 2 methoxys 1o, or hydroxyl with methoxy \n1p). Overall, BsAlsS exhibited relatively good activities in gen-\nerating a series of PAC class α-hydroxyketones with modifications \nof halogen, hydroxyl, and methoxy groups. Therefore, BsAlsS \ncould serve as a robust biocatalyst for providing diverse sub-\nstituted α-hydroxyketones, which can be further functionalized \ninto synthetic Ephedra-type alkaloids.\nWu et al. 2024 | https://doi.org/10.34133/bdr.0048 5\nScreening IREDs for reductive N-alkylamination of \nα-hydroxyketones\nTo date, the biological method for N-alkylation is limited to \nSAM-dependent PNMTs [27]. Chemical approaches are required \nto functionalize the N -group of nor(pseudo)ephedrine with \nother N-alkylations besides N-methylation. Recently, asym-\nmetric N-alkylation of ketones has gained great interest by \nusing IREDs [42,43]. The implementation of IREDs for the \nreductive N-alkylamination of α-hydroxyketones simplifies the \ntraditional TA-mediated transamination followed by chemical \nmodifications into a single-step enzymatic reaction (Fig. 4A). \nThe diversity of N-alkylation products generated by IREDs can \nbe easily adjusted by altering amine partners.\nIn this study, a set of IREDs was selected for testing: \nAspRedAmQ240A from Aspergillus oryzae was chosen for its \nbroad-scope carbonyl compounds with a variety of primary \nand secondary amines [44]; IR77A208N from Ensifer adhaerens \n[45] and IRG02 from S. albidoflavus [30] were selected because \nof their excellent capacities for bulky substrates.

As shown \nin Fig. S5, we confirmed the successful expression of IRED \ntogether with Bm GDH in E. coli. Based on the activity chart \nof different IREDs (Fig. 4B), IRG02 exhibited excellent activ -\nity toward amine donors 4  to 6: Substrate 1a was converted \nto secondary amine products 4a to 6a at 37%, 84%, and 77%. \nIRG02 showed higher specific activities with propargylamine \n5 and cyclopropylamine 6  over that of ammonia 3  and allyl-\namine 4. However, we found that IR77 A208N  exhibited a \nhigher activity with ammonia 3  when compared to that of \nIRG02. In comparison, AspRedAm Q240A was less reactive \ntoward tested amine partners 3 to 6  (Figs. S7 to S10). The \nassay revealed that IREDs such as IRG02 and IR77 A208N \nwould facilitate the reductive N -alkylamination of PAC with \ngood conversions. Three new bio-modifications (allyl 4a, \npropargyl 5a, and cyclopropyl 6a) at the N -group were estab-\nlished for the first time for creating synthetic Ephedra-type \nalkaloids, which were structurally confirmed by mass spec-\ntrum analysis (Fig. S12).\nTo further improve the reductive N-alkylamination of PAC, \nwe attempted to optimize the ratio of amine equivalents for \nimproved conversions. As shown in Fig. 4C, different conversions \nby IRG02 were achieved: Substrates 1a and 3 (40 equivalents) \ngave product 3a with 58% conversion; substrates 1a and 4 (40 \nequivalents) gave product 4a with 72% conversion; substrates \n1a and 5 (20 equivalents) gave product 5a with 91% conver -\nsion; substrates 1a and 6  (10 equivalents) delivered product \n6a with 77% conversion. In addition, IR77A208N-mediated reduc-\ntive amination achieved 58% conversion for the synthesis of \nproduct 3a.\nBased on the PAC-mediated reductive amination protocol, \na series of biotransformation was performed for transferring \nPAC-class α-hydroxyketones (1b to 1p) with different amine \npartners (4 to 6) using IRG02. When allylamine 4 was used as \nan amine partner, IRG02 showed good activities toward 1c, \n1d, and 1i and generated alkenyl-containing derivatives 4c, \n4d, and 4i with 28 to 86% conversions (Fig. 5 and Fig. S11). \nPropargylamine 5 afforded products 5c to 5f, 5l, and 5m with \n38 to 92% conversions (Fig. 5 and Fig. S11). Substrate 6 gave \nproducts 6b, 6c, 6d, 6g, 6m, and 6n with 50 to 88% conversions \n(Fig. 5 and Fig. S11). In addition, representative synthetic \nEphedra-type alkaloids were also confirmed by mass spectrum \nanalysis (Fig. S12). Overall, 18 synthetic Ephedra-type alkaloids \nwere successfully produced, and there is still plenty of room \nfor future exploration of new combinations with different \nα-hydroxyketones and amine partners.\nFig. 3. The summary of phenylacetylcarbinol (PAC) and its analogs.", "metadata": {"chunk_id": "39228751:0", "pdf_file": "/Users/viku/Documents/UIUC/work/PETase/data/ired/39228751.pdf", "title": "Wu et al. 2024 | https://doi.org/10.34133/bdr.0048 1"}}

The whole-cell catalyst of MR-IRG02-BmGDH was used to diversify Ephedra-type alkaloids with different PAC \nanalogs and amine donors.

As shown from the SDS-PAGE result (Fig. \nS6.1), we successfully expressed BsAlsS, IRG02, and BmGDH \nin a single E. coli. However, during the one-pot reaction, IRG02 \nexhibited a clear preference for the reductive amination of aro-\nmatic aldehydes over α-hydroxyketones (Fig. S6.2), favoring \nthe formation of by-products. One-pot concurrent conversion \nof BAL a, pyruvate 1, and cyclopropylamine 6 resulted in \napproximately 74% of the substrate a into a by-product, whereas \nthe target product 6a was only obtained at 26 ± 1% (Fig. 6). \nSubsequently, the one-pot sequential strategy was introduced \nto temporally separate 2 enzymatic reactions: Amine donors \nwere added after the completion of BsAlsS-mediated carboliga-\ntion. As shown in Table 2, 5 mM a gave 2.95 mM product 6a, \nreaching approximately 59% conversion. Additionally, we also \nexpanded the one-pot sequential reaction for the synthesis of \n4a and 5a, both of which reached ~31% conversion.\nConclusion\nTo replace the traditional TA-mediated transamination followed \nby chemical N-alkylamination, we adopted the IRED-mediated \nreductive N-alkylamination for the one-step functionaliza -\ntion of PAC. IRG02 from S. albidoflavus  was identified as a \ngood candidate for the reductive alkylamination of diverse \nα-hydroxyketones with different amine partners. Overall, 18 \nnon-natural Ephedra-type alkaloids were generated by IRG02, \nand some of these new-to-nature compounds were first-time \nfabricated by biological approaches, which might serve as poten-\ntial candidates for sympathomimetic drugs [18]. Notably, the \nN-alkylamination by propargylamine (5) is of particular interest \nto chemists, as further diversity at the alkynyl group could be \neasily created by using click chemistry [46]. In addition, these \nnew-to-nature compounds might be used for the synthesis of \nsynthetic tetrahydroisoquinoline (THIQ) [47] for improved \nantitumor, antiparasitic, and neurological activities. In the future, \nthe structural diversity of synthetic Ephedra-type alkaloids will \nbe further expanded by engineered CALSs and IREDs with bet-\nter activities [48,49]. In summary, we envision that more syn-\nthetic Ephedra-type alkaloids could be created through the \nintegration of knowledge and tools from chemistry and biology \n[50,51].\nAcknowledgments\nFunding: This work was supported by the National Natural \nScience Foundation of China (grant no. 32270087), Xiamen \nUniversity (grant no. 20720240120), and ZhenSheng Biotech.\nAuthor contributions: J.Y . conceived the project and designed \nthe experiments.

{"text": "Synthesis of Substituted Acyclic and Cyclic N-\nAlkylhydrazines by Enzymatic Reductive Hydrazinations\nNiels Borlinghaus,\n[a]\nDonato Calabrese,\n[b]\nLars Lauterbach,*\n[b]\nand Bettina M. Nestl*\n[a, c]\nImine reductases (IREDs) provide promising opportunities for\nthe synthesis of various chiral amines. Initially, asymmetric\nimine reduction was reported, followed by reductive aminations\nof aldehydes and ketones via imines. Herein we present the\nreductive amination of structurally diverse carbonyls and\ndicarbonyls with hydrazines (reductive hydrazination), catalyzed\nby the IRED from Myxococcus stipitatus. In analogy to IRED-\ncatalyzed reductive aminations, various carbonyls and dicarbon-\nyls could react with simple hydrazines to produce substituted\nacyclic and cyclic N-alkylhydrazines. By incorporating and\nscaling up a hydrogenase cofactor regeneration system, we\ndemonstrated the scalability and atom-efficiency of an H\n2\n-\ndriven double reductive hydrazination, highlightling the poten-\ntial of IREDs in biocatalysis.\nReductive aminations are among the most convenient and\nstraightforward reactions for amine synthesis – essential\nbuilding blocks for the development of agrochemicals and\npharmaceutical agents.\n[1]\nIn the recent years, NADPH-dependent\nimine reductases (IREDs) have emerged as efficient catalysts for\nreductive aminations, enabling the use of a range of amines –\nspanning from primary and secondary alkyl amines, aryl amines,\nhydroxyl amines, diamines, piperidines to pyrrolidines.\n[2–8]\nHydrazines are widely used in the pharmaceutical, agricultural\nand rocket fuel industries and are building blocks for N-\nheterocyclic compounds such as pyrazoles, pyrazines and\nindoles.\n[9,10]\nThe presence of hydrazine as an intermediate in\nnitrogenases illuminates the diverse roles of hydrazine com-\npounds in biological systems.\n[11]\nTo date, however, there have\nbeen limited biocatalytic methods reported in the literature\nthat could implement reductive aminations using hydrazines as\nreactants, so-called reductive hydrazinations.\n[12]\nThis is intrigu-\ning, given the numerous biologically active hydrazine products\nfound in nature with anti-microbial, anti-fungal, anti-oxidative\nor anti-cancerogenic properties.\n[13–15]\nMost of these alkaloids are\nderived from simple hydrazine precursors like phenylhydrazine,\n4-hydroxymethyl phenylhydrazine, N-aminoalanine, or piperazic\nacid.\n[12,13]\nInterestingly, there are biological studies indicating\nthe occurrence of methylhydrazine in the fungus Gyromitra\nesculenta and N,N-dimethylhydrazine in tobacco, which could\nact as a substrate for the formation of more complex\nhydrazines, hydrazidines or hydrazones.\n[16,17]\nBased on our recent results, earlier experiences, and in\ncontinuation of our research activities, we anticipated the use\nof IREDs could enable an efficient reductive hydrazination\nprocess. Mirroring the requirements for reductive amination\n(Scheme 1A), a method for reductive hydrazination should\nfacilitate the condensation of a carbonyl with one of the vicinal\namino groups of hydrazine to generate a hydrazone.\n[18,19]\nThis\nintermediate must then be selectively reduced over the\ncarbonyl starting material. In addition to reductive hydrazina-\ntions, we envisioned that hexahydropyridazines, 1,2 diazepanes,\nN-aminopyrrolidines and N-aminopiperidines could be obtained\nby utilizing dicarbonyls with hydrazines in double reductive\nhydrazination reactions (Scheme 1B).\n[a] N.

ChemBioChem published by Wiley-VCH GmbH\nChemBioChem\nwww.chembiochem.org\nResearch Article\ndoi.org/10.1002/cbic.202400700\nThe research in our laboratories has thus focused on\nreductive hydrazinations using IREDs for the facile preparation\nof hydrazines in one-pot under mild conditions.\nWe used an engineered NADH-dependent IRED variant and\nfound that it was effective in the application of our method. We\nthus also address the scalability of this biocatalytic process,\nacknowledging the challenges posed by the stoichiometric\nsupply for nicotinamide cofactors during upscaling. Building on\natom-efficient integration of the soluble [NiFe]-hydrogenase\n(SH) from Cupriavidus necator with IREDs for H\n2\n-driven reductive\namination, we extended this approach to double reductive\nhydrazination.\n[20–22]\nIn an earlier study, we have reported on a promising\nmethod for producing piperazines and azepanes enzymatically\nthrough double reductive aminations. To conduct these reac-\ntions, we utilized the R-selective IRED from Myxococcus stipitatus\n(R-IRED_Ms).\n[23]\nWe further engineered the cofactor specificity of\nR-IRED_Ms from NADPH to NADH yielding in variant R-IRED_Ms-\nV8. After demonstrating that variant V8 shows similar catalytic\nperformance compared to the wild-type enzyme (data not\nshown), we decided to use this variant for probing the reaction\nof various aldehydes and ketones in the presence of hydrazines\nin a spectrophotometric NADH-depletion assay. We employed\nseven different hydrazines (a–g) and 29 aldehydes and ketones\n(1–29) to inspect the substrate scope and limitations of the\nenzymatic reductive hydrazination. The results are detailed in\nTables 1 and 2.\nWe found that R-IRED_Ms-V8 is an effective catalyst as most\nenzymatic reactions provide the desired hydrazine products.\nThe reductive hydrazination rate of aldehydes and ketones to\nhydrazines on the catalyst are expressed as turnover frequen-\ncies (TOF) as a measure of activity obtained via the spectropho-\ntometric assay. The TOF indicates how many times the catalytic\ncycle occurs (turns) on a single site per unit time and is typically\ndefined as the number of reaction products generated per\nactive site per unit time. We chose to describe the enzyme\nactivity using TOF, when a spectrophotometric assay was\npossible, to provide a clear indication of the activity at the\nsingle catalyst active site level. We confirmed the formation of\nthese products through biotransformations. Due to the absence\nof hydrazine standards, the formed products were identified\nusing GC-MS (SI Chapter 4). We observed that R-IRED_Ms-V8\naccepted various carbonyl substrates, and in the absence of\nIRED catalyst, no product formation was observed and starting\nmaterials remained unaffected or reacted to the hydrazone\nintermediate without further reduction reactions. In general,\nhigher activities were observed for aliphatic aldehydes 1–9\n(Table 1, entries 1–6) compared to (non-cyclic) aliphatic ketones\n13–22 (Table 1, entry 7). Thereby, the best accepted non-cyclic\ncarbonyls were the aliphatic C4-substrates n-butanal (3, Table 1,\nentries 2–4, best aldehyde) and 2-butanone (14, Table 1, entry 7,\nbest non-cyclic ketone). Moreover, cyclohexanone (28, Table 2,\nentries 3–7) was found to afford the highest turnover frequency\nin the reductive hydrazination.\nMore bulky hydrazines and hydrazines protected with a\nBOC group were also compatible with phenylacetone (24, SI\nTable S2, entries 11–13) and 28. The comparison of the\nhydrazine substrates tested with carbonyl substrates 3 a–3 g\n(Table 1, entries 3–4), 24 a–24 g (SI Table S2, entries 11–13) and\n28 a–28 g (Table 2, entries 3–7), revealed that methylhydrazine\n(b) is best accepted by IRED. Hydrazine esters were also tested,\nsuch as ethyl hydrazinoacetate (h), but no activity has been\ndetected.\nMoreover, for some carbonyl and hydrazine combinations\nno activity could be detected in the spectrophotometric assay.\nSome hydrazone intermediates 11 a, 11 b, 12 b, 24 d caused the\nformation of a turbid solution or misleading signals in the\nNADH-depletion assay (3 g, 24 g, 28 g). Despite these results, we\nwere able to confirm the product formation by GC-MS for most\nof these substrate combinations (SI Chapter 4).\nIt is noteworthy that some of the hydrazine products\nformed can act as nucleophiles for subsequent reductive\nhydrazinations with carbonyl substrates (Scheme S1). However,\nthese secondary products were detected only in traces and can\nbe neglected for most reactions. The exception to this is the\ntransformation of 3 or 28 with hydrazine (a). In this substrate\ncombination, secondary reactions were significantly increased,\nbut we were able to circumvent this issue by increasing the\nhydrazine concentration and shortening the reaction time\nTable 1.

Next, we continued to examine the reaction scope\nwith various dicarbonyls to enable double reductive hydrazina-\ntion for the formation of cyclic hydrazines. For this reaction, two\nconsecutive IRED-catalyzed steps along with the consumption\nof two nicotinamide molecules are necessary to produce\nsaturated N-heterocycles (Scheme S2).\nIn principle, there are two approaches how the double\nreductive hydrazination of dicarbonyls can proceed, depending\non the substitution pattern of the hydrazine substrate – either\nboth (subtype 1) or one vicinal amino group is incorporated\ninto cyclic pyrazolidine or hexahydropyridazine products (sub-\ntype 2). For some hydrazine substrates, both subtypes are\npossible. In total, nine different saturated heterocycles were\nformed applying the double reductive hydrazination. The\nresults are summarized in Table 3.\nResults obtained from GC-MS showed that in some cases,\nthere was an accumulation of the cyclic hydrazone intermedi-\nate, formed after the first IRED-catalyzed reduction step. Based\non these results, we can conclude that for certain substrate\ncombinations, the second reduction step by the IRED is the rate\nlimiting step. As a result, it is not possible to determine the\noverall activity of the total reaction using the NADH-depletion\nassay. We thus characterized the enzymatic activity measuring\nendpoint yields via GC-MS and GC-FID.\nSince there were no product standards available, we used\ndiacetylated hexahydropyridazine 34 g (Table 3, entry 13) for\ncalibration curves and calculations of product formations\n(Table 3). No product formation was observed with diketones\n30 and 31 (Table 3, entries 1–2), as they rapidly reacted with\nhydrazines to form a pyrazole side product, as described in\nliterature.\n[24]\nInterestingly, the highest product formation of\n94 % was observed with glutaraldehyde (34, Table 3, entries 9–\n13) and 1,1-dimethylhydrazine (c), which only allows the\nreaction via subtype 2. Moderate product formations of up to\n14 % were detected for substrates 32 and 33 (Table 3, entries 3–\nTable 2.

Remarkably, despite its high toxicity to proteins, 34 was\nfound to be a suitable dicarbonyl for the double reductive\nhydrazination. Incubation of 34 with the hydrazine substrate for\n30 min before adding IRED resulted in a reduced concentration\nof toxic 34 due to the formation of the less toxic hydrazone\nintermediate, which is then converted into the product in\nfollowed enzymatic reductions. Overall, our studies have shown\nthat hydrazines are accepted nucleophiles for the enzymatic\nreductive hydrazination and can be used to form acyclic\nhydrazine products as well as hydrazine-containing N-hetero-\ncycles with different substitution patterns. Turnover frequencies\nof up to 36 min\n\u0000 1\n(= ^ 1.1 U mg\n\u0000 1\n) were reached for the reductive\nhydrazination of carbonyls. The highest product formation\n(94 %) was observed for the double reductive hydrazination of\n34 with c to generate N,N-dimethylpiperidin-1-amine (34 c,\nTable 3, entry 11). Notably, although chiral centers are formed\nduring the double reductive hydrazination, the lack of chiral\nstandards prevented us from fully discriminating the enantio-\nmeric excess in the products.\nWhile the initial biocatalytic system utilized GDH for\ncofactor regeneration, we aimed to improve the efficiency by\nintegrating the SH with R-IRED_Ms-V8, thereby establishing an\nH\n2\n-driven double reductive hydrazination process. We chose\ncompound 34 c as a proof-of-concept, which we prepared by\nconverting glutaraldehyde (34) and 1,1-dimethylhydrazine (c)\nusing the IRED. In this setup, we increased the reaction volumes\nto mimic a technical scale and adjusted the cofactor concen-\ntration, to maximize efficiency. We also extended the reaction\ntime to eight hours to account for changes in reaction kinetics\ndue to lower component concentrations. These changes were\ncrucial in maintaining high conversion rates without sacrificing\nefficiency. We were able to achieve a 92 % conversion rate\nunder these conditions, as evidenced by the results in Table 4.\nTo accurately describe the stereoselectivity of biocatalytic\nreductive hydrazination, the development and use of chiral\nstandard materials, higher catalytic activities for product\nisolation, and advanced chiral analytical methods are required.\nThe catalyst R-IRED_Ms-V8, noted for its effectiveness in the\nasymmetric synthesis of chiral amines, is anticipated to exhibit\nsimilar selectivity in reductive hydrazination. Preliminary chiral\nchromatographic data supports this hypothesis, showing\nenantiomeric excess (ee) greater than 75 % for highly active\ncatalyst-substrate combinations (data not shown).\nIn summary we have successfully developed an enzymatic\napproach for the synthesis of hydrazine derivatives through\nIRED-catalyzed reductive hydrazinations of (di)carbonyls. To\nachieve this, we used our previously engineered NADH-depend-\nent IRED variant (R-IRED_Ms-V8). With this engineered catalyst,\nwe were able to form non-cyclic hydrazines and prepare novel\nN-heterocycles, resulting in the production of pyrazolidine,\nhexahydropyridazine, pyrrolidine-1-amine or piperidine-1-amine\nproducts. We addressed the challenges of cofactor regeneration\nby integrating the soluble [NiFe]-hydrogenase from Cupriavidus\nnecator, enhancing atom efficiency and sustainability for large-\nscale applications. By developing an H\n2\n-driven double reductive\nhydrazination biocatalytic process, we have not only provided a\nmild and straightforward method for developing novel N-\nheterocyclic compounds but also set a new benchmark for\nsustainable green synthesis of hydrazine derivatives. Further\nstudies on the synthetic applications and improvement of IRED\ncatalysts are ongoing in our group.\nAuthor Contributions\nD.C. and N.B. performed all experiments, analyzed the results,\nand wrote the manuscript.

Here, we demonstrate how imine reductases can achieve annulation through tandem inter-\nand intramolecular reductive amination processes. Imine reductases were used in combination with further enzymes to access\nunsubstituted, α-substituted, and α,α′-disubstituted N-heterocycles from simple starting materials in one pot and under benign\nconditions. This work shows the remarkable flexibility of these enzymes to have broad activity against numerous substrates derived\nfrom singlular starting materials.\nKEYWORDS: imine reductase, reductive aminase, cyclization, N-heterocycles\n■\nINTRODUCTION\nWith half of all FDA-approved pharmaceuticals containing\nsaturated N-heterocycles, improved methods for their synthesis\nare essential (Figure 1a).\n1\nCurrent approaches, with limitations\naround stereochemical control through to sp\n3\nC−H function-\nalization, limit access to diverse scaffolds. One specific challenge\nis N-alkylation, with methods such as reductive amination and\nnucleophilic substitution resulting in overalkylation and poor\natom economy while depending on unsustainable reagents.\n2,3\nRecently, borrowing hydrogen catalysis has seen application in\nthe synthesis of saturated N-heterocycles through N-alkylation\nof amines with terminal diols; however, amine coupling partners\nhave typically been limited to benzylamine and aniline\nderivatives.\n4−6\nTo access α-substituted N-heterocycles, diol\nsubstrates containing a secondary alcohol would permit\nretention or generation of a stereocenter. Although this has\nbeen demonstrated asymmetrically, the scope remains limited to\nfew examples employing benzylamines, with reports proceeding\nwith poor chemoselectivity.\n7,8\nWhile intramolecular hydro-\namination offers an alternative route to these scaffolds, recent\nresearch has focused on C−H substitution at this position.\nTraditionally, this transformation has been performed using\nlow-temperature lithiation chemistry,\n9\nbut modern methods\nhave achieved it under preferable conditions by utilizing\ntransition metal\n10−12\nand photoredox catalysis (Figure\n1b).\n13,14\nAlthough synthesis of di-α-substituted heterocycles\nhas been achieved through double reductive amination of\ndiketone compounds,\n15\nwith key examples described in total and\niminosugar syntheses,\n16,17\na general asymmetric catalytic\nplatform is yet to be disclosed. Instead, strategies that prioritize\nredox-neutral cyclization chemistry (i.e., Paal-Knorr) followed\nby a global reduction are often preferred,\n18\ndespite the\nassociated challenges in stereocontrol.\nBiocatalysis has emerged as a robust platform for synthesis.\n19\nIt possesses distinct advantages over traditional synthetic\nreagents, such as operation under benign conditions, catalyst\ncomplementarity, excellent stereoselectivity, and no require-\nments for protecting groups. This potential has been realized\nmost in amine synthesis, with multiple pharmaceutical process\nmethods described, including contributions from Merck,\n20\nGSK,\n21\nPfizer,\n22,23\nNovartis,\n24\nand others.\n25\nWhile enzymes\nReceived: June 28, 2024\nRevised: September 3, 2024\nAccepted: September 13, 2024\nPublished: September 19, 2024\nResearch Articlepubs.acs.org/acscatalysis\n© 2024 The Authors.

{"text": "such as amine oxidases (MAOs)\n26\nand imine reductases\n(IREDs)\n27\nprovide options for setting stereocenters in\npreformed N-heterocycles, cyclization through N-alkylation by\na single enzyme has been long unfeasible due to known options\nsuch as transaminases (TAs)\n28\nand amine dehydrogenases\n(AmDHs)\n29\nbeing limited solely to primary amination. In 2017,\nan imine reductase subclass (reductive aminases, RedAms)\ncapable of catalyzing full aqueous reductive amination was\nreported.\n30\nThis synthetic potential has since been realized\nthrough industrial application in the synthesis of several drug\ncandidates on a process scale.\n25\nOne-pot cascade reactions showcase the potential of\nbiocatalysts for their synthesis. This has been exemplified in\nheterocycle synthesis, where TA-IRED combinations have\ngenerated saturated N-heterocycles from dicarbonyl sub-\nstrates.\n31−33\nRecent metagenomic IRED panels have also\nincreased the number of applications of these enzymes in\ncascades.\n34,35\nThis includes setting stereocenters following\ncyclization,\n36−39\nN-alkylation with redox surrogate reagents\nthrough a hydrogen borrowing approach,\n40\nand combination\nwith alcohol oxidase or carboxylic acid reductase for N-alkylated\nproducts.\n41\nRecent work also demonstrated the combination of\nchemoenzymatic approaches with amine oxidases,\n42\nand the use\nof aldolases to synthesize aminopolyols.\n43\nThere has also been\ndisclosure of multifunctional biocatalysts that simultaneously\nmediated several synthetic steps in one go.\n44\nHerein, we further\ndemonstrate this multifunctional ability of IREDs to form N-\nheterocycles through a sequential inter−intramolecular reduc-\ntive amination ring closure approach in the first report of these\nspecific types of transformations (Figure 1c).

In a previous paper describing\nthe engineering of AcCO6, we noted a general trend of high\nspecific activity for terminal diol substrates.\n45\nInspired by this,\nwe sought to compare our enzyme cascades to the chemical\nborrowing hydrogen literature, which inspired us to pursue a\nbiocatalytic equivalent to the reported diol annulation\nchemistry. While alcohol oxidases have been previously applied\nto the oxidation of diols,\n46\naccess to the dialdehyde is often\nlimited by overoxidation or the interception of intermediate\nhemiacetal tautomers to form lactones (Scheme 1).\n47\nFigure 1.

Hypothesizing that perhaps the intermediate hemiacetal\nintermediate tautomer 1 may be intercepted and oxidized by the\nglucose dehydrogenase (GDH) enzyme “CDX-901” required\nfor cofactor recycling, we measured the specific activity of CDX-\n901 cell-free extract (CFE) with 5-hydroxypentanal 4 through\nan NADPH formation assay. The CDX-901 CFE was found to\nbe active toward the oxidation of 4 and was replaced with the\nGDH fromThermoplasma acidophilum(TaGDH).\n48\nThe side\nactivity was not confirmed as being due to CDX-901 itself or\nanother enzyme present in the crude preparation. To our\ndelight, when the biotransformation was repeated with TaGDH,\nwe observed the formation of 1-allylpiperidine 3v. We speculate\nthat 5 was not observed due to its known role as an enzyme\ncross-linking reagent and that without further reaction it may\nsimply cross-link enzymes involved in its formation. This clearly\ndemonstrated the versatility of this class of enzyme, mediating\ntwo distinct reductive amination reactions, first using a primary\namine donor and then a secondary amine donor. The\nbifunctionality was of interest, leading us to probe the reaction\npathway, given the number of potential reaction partners\n(Scheme 1). The potential intermediate N-allyl-5-hydroxypen-\ntan-1-amine 4v was synthesized and subjected alongside 4 to an\noxidase activity screen as outlined previously.\n45\nAs 4 was shown\nto be a substrate for AcCO\n6\nwhile 4v was not (shown in red), we\nconcluded that “Route A” was the mechanism by which the\nheterocycle was formed. Following this, we sought to establish\nthe product scope for this cascade reaction.\nInitially, a panel of diol substrates was subjected to activity\nscreening (see Supporting Information). Alongside previously\ntested aliphatic diols, diethylene glycol and N-methyl-diethanol-\namine were screened to investigate whether the methodology\nmay be applied to form morpholines and piperazines. While\ndiethylene glycol and N-methyl-diethanolamine were moder-\nately active substrates for the engineered and wild-type choline\noxidases, respectively, applying them under IRED- cascade\nconditions suggested no product formation by GC-MS analysis.\nDespite this, correct masses for heterocyclic products were\nsuccessfully detected from the panel of aliphatic diols (Table 1).\nWhile the formation of saturated heterocycles was observed for\n6−8 membered rings, 1,4-butanediol 7 largely yielded products\nof mass consistent with pyrroles, possibly through a Paal-Knorr\nreaction. Incubating 9 with a primary amine and lone AcCO6\ndid not yield a possible pyrrole product, indicating the\ninvolvement of the IRED in this transformation. Both N-\nmethylpyrrolidine 7iii and N-methylpiperidine 3iii were\nundetected by GC-MS, but we speculate this is due to\nTable 1.

While\nthe majority of products were observed as single peaks in GC\nchromatograms, no reaction conversions are claimed due to the\npotential for undetectable side reactions such as enzyme cross-\ncoupling. Our attention then turned to the synthesis of α-\nsubstituted N-heterocycles. 5-Oxohexanol 13 and 6-oxohepta-\nnol 14 were synthesized and found to be substrates for AcCO6.\nSubjecting these substrates to conditions identical to those\nutilized in the terminal diol work yielded a range of asymmetric\nheterocycles (Table 1). Where possible, ee and absolute\nconfiguration were determined using chiral GC-FID, although\nthese assignments are largely limited due to challenges in\nachieving the separation of nonderivitizable products and\naccessing enantiomerically pure standards. The use of aryl\nketones 15 and 16 yielded enamine substrates, with AdRedAm\nunable to mediate the reduction of the more stable conjugated\nintermediate. Chemical reduction of these substrates still\nenabled a synthetic approach to 2-aryl substituted saturated\nN-heterocycles, but not in the same fashion as described above\n(see Supporting Information).\nFollowing the establishment of the product scope, our\nattention moved to synthesis on a preparative scale. Through\nusing a calibration curve, we were able to determine conditions\nthat would yield piperidines and azepanes with high conversion,\nalthough we were not able to produce pyrroles or azocanes at\nconversions that were synthetically useful. Preparative scale\nreactions were performed on a 1 mmol scale with N-heterocycle\nproducts isolated by distillation (Scheme 2). Preparative scale\nsynthesis was again performed on a 1 mmol scale on keto-\nalcohol precursor 13, with (S)-N-cyclopropyl-2-methylpiper-\nidine 13i isolated in good yield and ee following distillation.\nIRED-Mediated Diketone Cyclization. We next sought to\nextend the approach to disubstituted N-heterocycles, specifically\nthe synthesis of N-alkylated 2,5-disubstituted pyrrolidines from\n1,4-diketones via a three-step one-pot cascade catalyzed solely\nby an IRED. Initially, AdRedAm afforded N-methylpyrrolidine\n21iii in good to high conversions (>80%) from 2,5-decadione\nand methylamine, with no pyrrole formation observed.\nHowever, low diastereomeric ratios were observed under all\nconditions tested. The reactions also did not prove amicable\ntoward scaling, with byproducts consistently observed.\nIn an attempt to improve the stereochemical outcome, 30\nIREDs were selected from a metagenomic panel and screened\nagainst two 1,4-diketone substrates (21 and 22) and four amine\npartners (i, iii, v, vi) (see Supporting Information for complete\nset of IREDs and screening results).\n35\nAs a result, we were\npleased to obtain all eight N-alkylated 2,5-dissubstituted\npyrrolidines from the combination of the two diketones and\nfour amines evaluated, in good to high conversions within 24 h\n(Table 2).\nTo our surprise, the proposed cascade also allowed us to\naccess both cis and trans pyrrolidines in good to excellent\ndiastereo- and enantioselectivities, dependent on the biocatalyst\nutilized. These results show that some IREDs retain absolute\nenantiopreference in both steps, affording trans products (e.g.,\n2S,5S-21i from IR23), while others switch selectivity to afford\nthe cis products (e.g., 2S,5R-21i from IR49). These findings\nindicate that the substrate binding modes differ broadly among\nthe evaluated IREDs and the acyclic−cyclic imine intermediates.\nFurthermore, access to both diastereoisomers suggests that the\ndiastereoselectivity is primarily governed by the enzyme and not\nchemically dictated by the previously defined stereocenter.\nOur proposed route assumed that the first reductive\namination step occurs exclusively at the less hindered ketone\nmoiety (Route A, Scheme 3a). To test this hypothesis, we\nevaluated four ketones (23−26, Scheme 3b) of analogous\nhindrances and electronic effects to the bulkier side of our\ndiketones. None of the phenyl ketones (24−26) underwent\nreductive amination (see Supporting Information), implying\nthat for diketone 22, the cascade occurs exclusively through\nRoute A (Scheme 3a). Conversely, amine products were\nobserved when using pentyl ketone 23 as the substrate,\nindicating that Route B could occur simultaneously with\nRoute A for reactions using diketone 21. However, despite the\npresence of products, low conversions (10−30%) were\nobtained, which when combined with the fact that the selected\nIREDs showed high diastereo- and excellent enantioselectivies\n(Table 2), led us to conclude that Route A is the fastest, and\nmost likely, the sole pathway followed in reactions using\ndiketone 21.\nFinally, to demonstrate the synthetic applicability of the\ninvestigated cascade, a series of preparative-scale syntheses were\nperformed. Attempts to intensify reactions were unsuccessful,\nand consequently, the same conditions used on the analytical\nscale were applied for the preparative-scale reactions. Using our\nthree-step one-enzyme cascade, six N-alkylated 2,5-disubsti-\ntuted pyrrolidines were successfully synthesized on a 0.3 mmol\nscale (Scheme 4). Both diastereoisomers of pyrrolidines 21i\nwere synthesized with excellent enantioselectivities and good\nyields within 24 h, but 72 h was required for most other\nsubstrates. Typically, full substrate consumption was observed\nafter 24 h and the enamine intermediate/byproduct was\nobserved along with the desired product, followed solely by\nproduction of the desired product in the following 24−48 h.\n■\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe work presented here has demonstrated the bifunctionality\nof a series of wild-type IREDs, able to catalyze multiple reductive\naminations in a cascade sequence derived from the same starting\nmaterials. We have expanded the biocatalytic reaction toolbox\nthrough the demonstration of IRED-catalyzed annulation\nreactions and have demonstrated how enzyme engineering\nmay influence catalysis with the first alcohol oxidase capable of\ngenerating dialdehydes with complete chemoselectivity.\nThrough applying these enzymes in combination, four distinct\nsynthetic steps were achieved within one pot, and trans-\nformations previously unique to precious metal-catalyzed\nborrowing hydrogen chemistry requiring forcing conditions\nScheme 2.

Imine reduc-\ntases (IREDs) are one such enzyme that possesses excellent stereoselectivity,\nand stereocomplementary members are pervasive in the family. However, the\nregulatory mechanism behind stereocomplementarityremains cryptic.\nHerein, we reconstruct a panel of active ancestral IREDs and trace the evolu-\ntion of stereoselectivity from ancestors to extant IREDs. Combined with coe-\nvolution analysis, we reveal six historical mutations capable of recapitulating\nstereoselectivity evolution. An investigation of the mechanism with X-ray\ncrystallography shows that they collectively reshape the substrate-binding\npocket to regulate stereoselectivity inversion. In addition, we construct an\nempirical ﬁtness landscape and discover that epistasis is prevalent in stereo-\nselectivity evolution. Ourﬁndings emphasize the power of ASR in cir-\ncumventing the time-consuming large-scale mutagenesis library screening for\nidentifying mutations that change functions and support a Darwinian premise\nfrom a molecular perspective that the evolution of biological functions is a\nstepwise process.\nStereoselectivity of enzymes, the ability to determine which enantio-\nmer dominates in the achiral-to-chiral transformation, is critical for life\nand asymmetric biotransformation\n1,2. For example, L-type amino acids\ncomprise almost all proteins on earth, and D-saccharides constitute a\nwide variety of sugar compounds. Enzymatic catalysis is essential to\nendow molecules with chirality during their de novo synthesis in vivo.\nHence, stereoselectivity is a crucial enzymatic property for ensuring\nenantiomerically pure biomolecules. Furthermore, the stereo-\nselectivity of enzymes plays a signiﬁcant role in asymmetric organic\nreactions\n3. Unfortunately, naturally occurring enzymes are not always\nable to achieve excellent enantiomeric excess ( ee) or desired\nstereoselectivity in asymmetric catalysis, but directed evolution can be\nemployed to improve or even reverse stereoselectivity4,5. However,\nundeﬁned molecular mechanisms often require labor-intensive\nexperiments to identify key mutations that manipulate stereo-\nselectivity. Therefore, illuminating the mechanism behind the stereo-\nselective evolution of enzymes is highly desirable.\nA variety of strategies have been proposed to reverse enzyme\nstereoselectivity based on horizontal biochemical analysis, such as the\ncombinatorial active-site saturation test (CAST) and the mirror-image\nstrategy\n5,6.

Although stereoselectivity inversion has been widely studied in\nthe protein engineeringﬁeld, the evolutionary trajectory of stereo-\nselectivity is not well explored from an evolutionary biochemistry\nperspective. Ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR) is a speciﬁca n d\nhighly efﬁcient approach for interrogating the evolution of protein\nfunctions in evolutionary biochemistry\n8– 11. However, only one example\nof ASR has been reported to date for studying stereoselectivity\nevolution\n12. By experimentally characterizing ancestral enzymes loca-\nted in the evolution trajectory of functional changes, detailed insights\ninto biophysical mechanisms may be gained that are often inaccessible\nusing biochemistry alone\n13– 15. Compared with the above-mentioned\nstrategies, ASR is better able to identify the crucial residues that switch\nenzyme function. It can directly pinpoint the speciﬁc amino acid types\nin key sites without performing saturation mutagenesis\n16,17. Addition-\nally, epistasis, the phenomenon in which the effect of mutations on\nfunctions substantially depends on other mutations, often complicates\nthe study of sequence-structure-function relationships8,9.E m p i r i c a l\nevidence has shown that ASR can help reduce the effect of epistasis by\nreintroducing historical substitutions into a genetic background that is\nidentical or very similar to the one in which they originally occurred\n9,11.\nTherefore, key residues can be swapped between ancestral sequences\nwith different stereoselectivity to investigate the corresponding reg-\nulatory mechanism of stereochemistry.\nImine reductases (IREDs) are a class of NAD(P)H-dependent oxi-\ndoreductases that catalyze the reduction of imines and the reductive\namination of carbonyl compounds and amines to their corresponding\namines\n18. Numerous stereocomplementary IREDs have been identiﬁed\na n du s e dt os y n t h e s i z eav a r i e t yo fa m i n e s19– 21. In addition, a range of\nstudies on expanding substrate scope, exploring new reactions, and\nengineering enzymes for industrial applications have been\nperformed\n22– 26. However, there have been no explicit experimental\ninsights regarding the mechanism underlying stereocomplementarity.\nBased on previous empirical biochemical data and horizontal multiple\nsequence alignment, highly conserved aspartate or tyrosine residues\nlocated at standard position 187 (residue numbering refers to PDB ID\n3ZHB) appears to be responsible for opposite stereoselectivity in the\nIRED family\n27. However, this hypothesis has not been validated within\nextant enzymes by direct residue swapping experiments. This is in part\nbecause epistasis generally does not enable residue interchange in\nextant enzyme sequences. This weakness of horizontal research can be\ncircumvented by conducting residue swapping experiments on an\nancestral sequence. More importantly, much empirical evidence has\ndemonstrated that ASR is able to reveal historical mutations leading to\nfunction divergence in two protein subfamilies with different\nfunctions\n28– 31.\nIn the present work, we sought to identify the historical sub-\nstitutions regulating the stereoselectivity of IREDs using ASR and\nunveil the evolutionary mechanism of stereoselectivity. Six historical\nmutations leading to the stereoselectivity reversion were identiﬁed via\ncoevolution analysis. We then used X-ray crystallography to determine\nprotein structures and gain structural insights into the mechanisms by\nwhich the six historical mutations reverse stereoselectivity. We also\nconstructed an empirical ﬁtness landscape consisting of the six\nmutations to uncover the role of epistasis in the evolutionary process\nthat reverses IRED stereoselectivity. Through this work, we demon-\nstrate that ASR is an efﬁcient strategy for identifying mutations reg-\nulating stereoselectivity, providing a method for the directed\nevolution of stereoselectivity in enzymes.\nResults\nReconstruction and characterization of ancestral IREDs\nInitially, we performed multiple sequence alignment and phylogenetic\nanalyses on 1408 IREDs from a public IRED sequence database (Imine\nReductase Engineering Database version 3; https://www.ired.\nbiocatnet.de) and 18 outgroup sequences, and all maximum\nlikelihood ancestral IRED amino acid sequences in this study were\ninferred based on the phylogenetic tree (Supplementary Fig. 1).\nInterestingly, we found that all Y-type sequences (those with Tyr at\nstandard position 187, corresponding to position 170 in ancestral\nsequences) all form a relatively late branching clade in the phyloge-\nnetic tree (Supplementary Fig. 1). By contrast, D-type sequences (those\nwith Asp at standard position 187) are dispersed throughout the whole\nphylogenetic tree, and many are close to the last common ancestor\n(LCA, N1). We, therefore, speculated that the highly conserved Asp\nlocated at standard position 187 is probably an ancestral trait in the\nIRED family, while Tyr is its derived genotype.\nTo verify this hypothesis, weﬁrstly inferred the maximum like-\nlihood amino acid sequence of the LCA. Sequence analysis results\nindicated that residue 170 of LCA is Asp, belonging to D-type\nsequences in the IRED family, conﬁrming the above hypothesis (Sup-\nplementary Fig. 2). Subsequently, weassessed the stereoselectivity of\nN1 toward model substrate1a using chiral gas chromatography. The\nresults showed that N1 displayed excellent (S)-stereoselectivity toward\n1a with > 99.9%ee (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. 3).\nEvolvability of stereoselectivity in IREDs\nOur group previously described eight IREDs that catalyze1a with\nexcellent stereoselectivity, including two enzymes with R-stereo-\nselectivity that belong to the Y-type clade20. Based on these previous\nresults and phylogenetical analysis, we speculated that N560 (the\nrecent common ancestor of Y-type IREDs) would asymmetrically\nreduce 1a to generate (R)-2a. To validate this speculation, we\nexperimentally resurrected N560 and characterized its stereo-\nselectivity toward 1a. As expected, N560 displayed R-stereo-\nselectivity, yielding (R)-2a with 41% ee (Fig. 1d and Supplementary\nFig. 5). To investigate how stereoselectivity evolves from an ancestor\nwith S-stereoselectivity to descendants withR-stereoselectivity, we\nnarrowed our analysis to the speciﬁc trajectory from N1 to N560\n(Fig. 1c). We then experimentally resurrected these intermediate\nancestors (N2– N559) in this evolution pathway and biochemically\ncharacterized their stereoselectivity toward1a. The results demon-\nstrated that the ancestors N1– N559 belonging to D-type sequences\nexhibit excellent S-stereoselectivity (>90% ee,F i g .1d and Supple-\nmentary Figs. 2– 5). Importantly, we observed that stereoselectivity\ninversion occurs at the evolutionary interval between N559 and\nN560. Moreover, it should be noted that the substitution of residue\n170 from D to Y also occurs at this interval. In addition, we also\ninvestigated the evolution pattern of stereoselectivity in alternative\nancestral sequences (AltN1– AltN5 and AltN557– AltN560) to support\nthe robustness of reconstruction (Supplementary Fig. 7). Consistent\nwith our results for the maximum likelihood ancestors, stereo-\nselectivity inversion occurred at the evolution interval between\nAltN559 and AltN560 (Supplementary Fig. 7). Moreover, we also\nmeasured the speciﬁc activity of ancestral enzymes and their corre-\nsponding alternative versions (Supplementary Table 2). All ancestral\nenzymes were expressed in soluble form, which enabled the above-\nmentioned experiments to be successful (Supplementary Fig. 8).\nThese results demonstrated that the stereoselectivity of IREDs is a\nhighly evolvable trait within the targeted trajectory. Therefore, the\nhistorical mutations responsible for the evolution of stereoselectivity\ncan be determined.\nIdentiﬁcation of historical mutations through coevolution\nanalysis\nTo identify the historical substitutions reversing stereoselectivity in\nthe evolutionary interval between N559 and N560, we chose N559 as\nthe target object for subsequent protein engineering. We ﬁrst\ninvestigated whether the single mutation from Asp to Tyr at position\n170 of N559 inverts its stereoselectivity. The results showed that the\nD170Y mutation could not reverse the stereoselectivity preference of\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54613-3\nNature Communications|        (2024) 15:10330 2\nN559, but it signiﬁcantly decreased theee of (S)-2a from 93% to 25%\n(Supplementary Fig. 9). This indicates that position 170 plays a vital\nrole in regulating stereoselectivity. Furthermore, this also implied\nthat additional historical mutations are necessary to invert\nstereoselectivity.\nBesides in silico protein structure prediction, coevolution analysis\nis also used to identify important mutations impacting protein\nfunction\n32,33. To unveil the additional historical mutations, we per-\nformed coevolution analysis on ancestral sequences (N1– N560) and\neight extant enzyme sequences using ibis2analyzer34.B a s e do nt h i s\nanalysis, mutations co-evolving with the important substitution D170Y\nwere determined. The results showed that inversion fromS-t oR-ste-\nreoselectivity is associated with the six mutations L19M, C67S, T94S,\nA119G, I120V, and D170Y (Fig.2a, right). Subsequently, we introduced\nthe six substitutions into N559 to generate mutant N559-M6. As\nexpected, the stereoselectivity of N559-M6 was successfully inverted\nto theR-conﬁguration from theS-conﬁguration, generating (R)-2a with\n67% ee (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 6). Furthermore, we also con-\nducted back-mutations of the same six sites in N560 to generate\nmutant N560-M6, and stereoselectivity was also inverted from 41%ee\nR\nto 73% eeS (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 6). These protein\nengineering results demonstratedthat these coevolution mutations\nplayed a crucial regulatory role in the evolution of IRED\nstereoselectivity.\nTo further verify the role of the six coevolution mutations in\nstereoselectivity regulation, more imine substrates (1b– 1f)w e r eu s e d\nfor biotransformation. We found that N559 possesses opposite ste-\nreoselectivity to N559-M6 toward theﬁve substrates (Fig.2c, Supple-\nmentary Fig. 10 and Supplementary Table 3). The results indicated that\nthe stereoselectivity inversion caused by the six historical substitu-\ntions was an intrinsic property of enzymes during evolution.\nStructural basis for the stereoselectivity evolution of IREDs\nTo examine the role of the six historical mutations that reversed ste-\nreoselectivity from a structural perspective, we determined the crystal\nstructures of N559 (PDB: 8JKU) and N559-M6 (PDB: 8HWY) complexed\nwith NADP\n+ at resolutions of 2.57 Å and 2.32 Å, respectively (Supple-\nmentary Fig.11a– d). Similar to the extant enzymes, ancestral IREDs\nwere homodimers with an unusual reciprocal domain sharing\narrangement, with the active site located at the interface formed by the\ntwo monomers (Fig.3a, left). In the structure of N559-M6, two different\nbinding conformations of NADP\n+ were observed.

Due to the limited space for substrate binding in the\nsecond conformation, we predicted that this upturned conformation\nis catalytically inactive. Therefore, theﬁrst conformation of NADP\n+ in\nN559-M6 was used for subsequent structural analysis.\nDuring the reaction catalyzed by IREDs, a hydrogen atom and an\nelectron are transferred from NADPH to imine substrates. Therefore,\nNADP+ was located in the center of the catalytic pocket of IREDs. To\nfacilitate a precise comparison of catalytic site structures between\nN559 and N559-M6, we superposed the NADP\n+ molecule from the\ncrystal structures so that we could observe a signiﬁcant conformation\nchange in the Rossmann fold region (Fig. 3a, right). This\nconformational change further reduced the space in the catalytic\npocket of N559-M6 (Fig.3c). As shown in Fig.3b, ﬁve out of six\nmutations were located in three regions around the NADP+ binding\npocket, whereas only one mutation, D170Y, was located in close\nproximity to the predicted substrate binding site next to the nicoti-\nnamide ring of NADP\n+. Since Tyr has a larger side chain than Asp,\nD170Y further reduced the volume of the catalytic pocket (Fig.3c).\nTo understand how the reduced space in the catalytic pocket\nreversed the stereoselectivity of N559-M6, we conducted molecular\ndocking analysis. As shown in Fig.4, the location of the two ring\nstructures of the substrate was exchanged in the binding model of\nN559 and N559-M6. The D170Y mutation in N559-M6 caused steric\nhindrance with the substrate-binding conformation of N559, which led\nto the adoption of a new substrate-binding conformation in N559-M6\n(Fig.4b).

As a result, these changes\ncontribute to the inversion of the substrate-binding conformation in\nN559-M6 from Pro-S to Pro-R (Fig. 4).\nEmpiricalﬁtness landscape of stereoselectivity\nOur investigation of the six historical substitutions led to two addi-\ntional pertinent questions. Are the six mutations necessary for ste-\nreoselectivity inversion a minimum number of mutations? Does\nepistasis play a role in the formation of novel stereoselectivity pre-\nferences, and if so, how does it work? To answer these questions, we\nconstructed an empiricalﬁtness landscape with 64 (2\n6) genotypes and\n720 (6!) potential evolutionary paths using stereoselectivity as a proxy\nfor ﬁtness (Fig.5). We quantitatively deﬁned theﬁtness using the dif-\nference inee between N559 and each intermediate. Speciﬁcally, S- and\nR-stereoselectivity were denoted by positive and negative signs (Sup-\nplementary Table 5); a larger value indicates a higher level ofﬁtness in\nour landscape, according to our deﬁnition.\nWe found that 15 mutants could change the stereoselectivity of\nmodel substrate 1a from S-t o R-stereoselectivity. These mutants\ninclude one double mutant, three triple mutants, six quadruple\nmutants, four quintuple mutants, and one sextuple mutant (Fig.5). The\nresults indicated that a minimum of two mutations was sufﬁcient for\nstereoselectivity inversion. Except for the L19M/A119G mutant, all the\nother 14 mutants contain the D170Y mutation. Additionally, we found a\nsigniﬁcant positive correlation between the number of mutations and\nthe number of mutants altering stereoselectivity ( r =0 . 9 0 ,\nSupplementary Fig. 13 and Supplementary Table 6). The correlation\nrelationship indicates that the effects of mutations depend on the\nsequence background, a phenomenon known as epistasis. These\nresults demonstrate that the order of mutation introduction is vital for\nstereoselectivity evolution. In other words, epistasis is pervasive in this\nempiricalﬁtness landscape.\nWe then examined the epistasis pattern in this landscape by\nanalyzing mutation-inducedﬁtness changes and performing statistical\nanalyses. A closer look at this empiricalﬁtness landscape showed three\ntypes of epistasis (Supplementary Fig. 14a– c). A further analysis of the\ncontribution of the three types of epistasis to the whole landscape was\nperformed using the MAGELLAN tool\n36,37. According to these results,\nmagnitude epistasis explained 47.9% ofﬁtness variations, while sign\nepistasis and reciprocal sign epistasis explained 35.4% and 13.3%,\nrespectively (Supplementary Fig. 15). Additionally, we used a Python\npackage to detect epistasis and quantify the fraction of variation\naccounted for by ﬁrst- to sixth-order (the interaction among six\nmutations) epistatic coefﬁcients\n38. Based on these results, 32% of var-\niation could be explained without epistasis, 24% by second-order\nepistasis, and 44% by higher-order epistasis (interactions between\nthree or more mutations, Supplementary Fig. 14d). The results from\nstatistical analyses highlight the importance of considering epistasis\nwhen predicting mutation effects.\nDiscussion\nIn the present study, we demonstrated the evolutionary pattern of\nIRED stereoselectivity using ASR and artiﬁcially reproduced it via\na\nb\n3.2 Å\nY170\nD170\nFig. 4 | Insights into the mechanism of stereoselectivity inversion.Stereoview of\nthe molecular docking results for substrate1a in the active pocket of N559 (a)a n d\nN559-M6 (b).

Speciﬁcally, a set of six histor-\nical substitutions responsible for the evolution of stereoselectivity\nfrom ancestral S-selectivity to derivedR-selectivity were identiﬁed\nusing coevolution analysis. To identify key historical substitutions\ncausing a change in function in the focused evolution trajectory,\nempirical evidence mostly relies on structural information or relevant\nprior knowledge about sites affecting function in extant enzymes\n12,15,16.\nIn addition, it is often necessary to establish a large library of mutants.\nTo identify single target mutations or combinations of mutations that\nchange protein functions, vast screening experiments are also\nneeded\n39,40. In order to overcome these challenges, we present an\nalternative approach that based on ancestral and extant sequences to\nperform a coevolution analysis to determine key historical\nsubstitutions. Here, our results showed that the alternative approach is\nefﬁcient for uncovering historical mutations responsible for stereo-\nselectivity evolution. As an added beneﬁt, this approach also reduces\nthe effort needed to screen large libraries of mutants.\nFurthermore, we investigated the structural basis of the six coe-\nvolution mutations recapitulating stereoselectivity evolution by\ndetermining crystal structures. Our analyses of the mechanism\nunderlying stereoselectivity evolution are in accordance with several\nprevious studies on stereoselectivity inversion. Speciﬁcally, a handful\nof sequence mutations reversed stereoselectivity by reshaping the\nsubstrate-binding pocket\n41,42. Our structural analysis showed thatﬁve\nout of six substitutions did not directly interact with the substrate,\nindicating that ASR has signiﬁcant potential to capture remote\nN559\n0\nL19M\n10\nC67S\n 1\nT94S\n 7\nA119G\n 6\nI120V\n 7\nD170Y\n67\n19/67\n19/94\n19/119\n19/120\n19/170\n67/94\n67/119\n67/120\n67/170\n94/119\n94/120\n94/170\n119/120\n119/170\n120/170\n4\n8\n115\n7\n75\n4\n5\n3\n43\n7\n4\n78\n3\n78\n73\n6\n 7\n 3\n71\n10\n7\n76\n5\n117\n30\n6\n 0\n80\n2\n 31\n73\n7\n 98\n 75\n107\n19/67/94/119\n19/67/94/120\n19/67/94/170\n19/67/119/120\n19/67/119/170\n19/67/120/170\n19/94/119/120\n19/94/119/170\n19/94/120/170\n19/119/120/170\n67/94/120\u0010170\n67/94/119/120\n67/119/120/170\n94/119/120/170\n67/94/119/170\n12\n6\n 61\n7\n133\n 48\n8\n128\n 75\n126\n4\n112\n70\n123\n105\n19/67/94/119/170\n19/67/94/120/170\n19/67/119/120/170\n19/94/119/120/170\n67/94/119/120/170\n19/67/94/119/120\n 5\n83\n151\n120\n124\n99\nN559-M6\n160\n9\n1\n1\n919\n11\n11\n1\n119\n1\n911\n214/1\n7017\n9/1 0\n70\n70\n2000\n0/\n9/1\n00\n170\n\u0010170\n0/1117\n17\n7/9\n94/1\n70\n/120 0\n9/1\neeS=100%\n0\neeR=100%\nPositive\nNeutral\nNegative\n19/67/94\n19/67/119\n19/94/170\n19/119/120\n19/119/170\n19/120/170\n67/119/120\n67/119/170\n94/119/170\n94/120/170\n67/120/170\n119/120/170\n19/67/120\n19/67/170\n19/94/119\n19/94/120\n67/94/119\n67/94/120\n67/94/170\n94/119/120\nFig. 5 | Empiricalﬁtness landscape encompassing the six historical substitu-\ntions.The empiricalﬁtness landscape reﬂects the transition from N559 to N559-M6\nfor R-stereoselectivity.

This aspect differs from\nseveral previous studies in which inverting stereoselectivity was\nachieved by mutating residues that interact directly with substrate\n7,44.\nCompared with ASR, the traditional biochemistry strategies are inef-\nﬁcient in detecting crucial residues distant from the substrate43. Here,\nour study demonstrates that reshaping the substrate-binding pocket\nby mutation of residues around NAD(P)H is an effective strategy for\nthe inversion of stereoselectivity of NADPH-dependent oxidor-\neductases. Speciﬁcally, we suggest that these residues located at the\nloop surrounding the NADPH-binding pocket should be a hotspot for\nmanipulating the stereoselectivity of the IREDs.\nThe empiricalﬁtness landscape allows us to investigate the evo-\nlution of protein function by exploring all evolutionary\nintermediates\n45– 48. Using this approach, we can analyze the relation-\nships between sequences and functions in detail to understand the\nmechanisms of mutations for mediating functional changes. Numer-\nous studies have demonstrated that creating empiricalﬁtness land-\nscapes is a powerful way to reveal accessible evolutionary paths,\nexplore the potential for evolutionary predictability, and investigate\nepistasis\n49,50.O u rﬁndings on the empiricalﬁtness landscape are in\nagreement with those of previous studies, in which enzyme activity\nwas often selected as a proxy forﬁtness\n51– 54. The sign epistasis limits\nthe number of available evolutionary pathways where the proxy\nincreases monotonically\n55. According to our statistical analysis, sign\nepistasis contributes 35.4% toﬁtness variations. As expected, only 2%\n(16/720) of trajectories are monotonically increasing in our empirical\nﬁtness landscape (Fig.5). Despite the minimum requirement for ste-\nreoselectivity inversion being two mutations, we found that the\nprobability of gaining a new stereoselectivity preference increases as\nthe number of accumulated mutations increases. Furthermore, the\norder in which mutations are introduced determines whether a\nmutation results in a gain-or-loss of function. Epistasis is the main\ncause of the above-mentioned scenarios\n56– 58.T h e s eﬁndings demon-\nstrated that early mutations play a permissive role by epistatic inter-\naction to generate and improve the gain-to-function effect of latter\nmutations\n59,60. More than half of the ﬁtness variations could be\nexplained by epistasis, according to our statistical analyses (Supple-\nmentary Fig. 14d). Therefore, our results suggest that incorporating\nepistasis into predictive models contributes to improving the accuracy\nof predictions for the effect of mutations on protein functions. A\nplethora of epistasis-based predictive models have been developed in\nrecent years, and these models outperform additive models without\nepistasis, such as EVmutation and Innov’SAR\n61,62.\nA number of ASR studies use the maximum likelihood (ML)\napproach to infer ancestral sequences, and one study on simulated\ndata revealed that the ML method is the most reliable method to\nestimate ancestral sequences\n63. It is possible, however, that the ML\napproach would incur statistical uncertainty at some sites, which\nmeans that the reconstructed residues at such sites would possess\nother replaceable residues. Eick et al. conducted a systematic study to\ninvestigate the robustness of reconstructed ancestral protein func-\ntions to statistical uncertainty in the ML method\n64.I ti sn o t e w o r t h yt h a t\nthe alternative ancestors’ protein functions are qualitatively unchan-\nged from those of their maximum-likelihood ancestors, according to\ntheir results. However, they demonstrated that precise quantitative\nmeasurements of function, such as, enzyme kinetic parameters, vary\namong alternative ancestors. Although our reconstruction has a high\naverage posterior probability for each ancestral sequence (Supple-\nmentary Fig. 16), we also found the same experimental phenomenon in\nthe present study. The speciﬁc activity of N560 is signiﬁcantly higher\nthan AltN560 (Supplementary Table 2), which is a consequence of\nreconstruction uncertainty. Additionally, we also found that the cata-\nlytic efﬁciency of ancestral enzymes is lower than extant enzymes\n(Supplementary Table 7), which is in accord with Jensen’s hypothesis\n65.\nMeanwhile, the results may indicate that the ancestral IREDs possess\nhigh catalytic promiscuity, and our study in progress supports this\naspect.\nFurthermore, we observed differences in speciﬁc activity between\nreconstructed ancestral enzymes (Supplementary Table 2). According\nto lessons learned from directed evolution campaigns, for example,\ntwo mutations (V122C and F177W) at the active pocket inScIR improve\nits speciﬁc activity 10-fold21. The results indicate that positions 122 and\n177 play an important role in regulating activity in IREDs. Then, we\nlooked at the residues in the active pocket of ancestral enzymes and\ndiscovered obvious mutations in the location, especially for N559 and\nN560 (Supplementary Fig. 17). Speciﬁcally, we observed that the two\nkey positions (122 and 177) have mutated compared with other\nancestral enzymes with different magnitudes of activity (Supplemen-\ntary Fig. 17). Therefore, we speculated that differences in the active\npocket residues caused a signiﬁcant variation in activity among the\nreconstructed ancestral enzymes. An empirical study on the directed\nevolution of enantioselectivity revealed a trade-off between enantios-\nelectivity and activity, resulting in improved enantioselectivity at the\nexpense of activity\n66. The other study on alcohol dehydrogenase also\nshowed that enantioselectivity inversion would decrease thekcat/Km\n67.\nThe empirical evidence indicated that stereoselectivity and activity are\nin a trade-off relationship in protein engineering\n66,67. Our results on\nN559 and N559-M6 are consistent with this type of trade-off phe-\nnomenon (Supplementary Table 5). However, one empirical study also\nshowed that further directed evolution would break the trade-off\n6.\nAccording to Yu et al., early stereoselective inversion reduces enzyme\nactivity compared to the wild type, but further directed evolution\nsimultaneously increases both stereoselectivity and enzyme activity6.\nAdditionally, we examined the activities of the 64 mutants located in\nthe empiricalﬁtness landscape and observed 18 intermediates with\nimproved activity than N559 (Supplementary Table 5). Moreover, the\nmutants with inverted stereoselectivity exhibit decreased activity\ncompared to the start point (N559).\nIn summary, our results demonstrate that ancestral sequence\nreconstruction has unique advantages for exploring the molecular\nmechanism underlying stereoselectivity evolution. Through experi-\nmentally characterizing the sequence space containing a complete\ncombination of all historical mutations, the effect of epistasis on\nfunction evolution could be scrutinized by analyzing the speciﬁc\nchange in ﬁtness and conducting statistical analysis. Moreover,\nancestral sequences proved to be suitable starting templates for pro-\ntein engineering campaigns aimed at stereoselectivity reversion\n12.W i t h\nknowledge of the key historical mutations underpinning the evolution\nof a speciﬁc enzyme function, ancestral proteins could be engineered\nthrough directed evolution experiments with less expense, providing\nefﬁcient avenues for the development of new biocatalysts with desir-\nable functions.\nMethods\nPhylogenetic analysis and ancestral sequence reconstruction\nA total of 1409 extant IRED sequences were downloaded from the\nImine Reductase Engineering Database version 3 ( https://ired.\nbiocatnet.de/)\n27. These sequences mainly originate from three bac-\nterial phyla, except ten sequences are of eukaryotic origin\n(Ascomycota)\n27. More than 80% of sequences are from Actinobacteria,\nfollowed by Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. One sequence with X as the\ninitial amino acid was excluded in subsequent analyses. Using the\nDASH option of the MAFFT online server, 1408 IRED sequences and 18\noutgroup sequences were aligned using structure-based multiple\nsequence alignment (MSA;https://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/)\n68.\nThe rest of the alignment parameters were default values. We then\nmanually deleted gaps in the MSA results to decrease subsequent\nphylogeny reconstruction noise. Two principles are employed to\nmodify major indels in the MSA: (1) We removed major indels that are\ncaused by outgroup sequences. These indels result from differences in\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54613-3\nNature Communications|        (2024) 15:10330 8\nstructure between ingroup and outgroup sequences. (2) We discard\npositions where more than 50% of sequences contain gaps in the\nMSA\n39. An excess of indels at a location suggests that the location is not\nsufﬁciently conserved in the evolutionary process, since protein\nstructure is more conservative in evolution. PhyML 3.0 was then used\nto construct a phylogenetic tree of IRED sequences (http://www.atgc-\nmontpellier.fr/phyml/)69. The matrix of amino acid substitution WAG\nwith parameters +G + I + F was selected by Smart Model Selection\n(SMS) according to the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), which was\nthe best-ﬁtting evolutionary model\n70. The branch supports of the\nphylogenetic tree were calculated using BOOSTER71,a na l t e r n a t i v e\nmethod to using traditional bootstrap values, that is more suitable for\nlarge datasets and deep branches. To determine the last common\nancestor of IREDs, ornithine cyclodeaminase (a type of oxidoreductase\ndistantly related to IREDs) sequences were chosen as the outgroup.\nAncestral sequences at each focused node in the phylogenetic\ntree were inferred using Graphical Representation of Ancestral\nSequence Predictions (GRASP;http://grasp.scmb.uq.edu.au/)\n72,an e w\nmethod that can infer insertion-deletion (indel) reconstruction. The\nWAG was selected as the evolutionary model in GRASP, and marginal\nreconstruction was selected for ancestral sequence reconstruction. All\nsequences used to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree were inputted\ninto GRASP for inferring ancestral sequences. The second most-likely\nsequences for each ancestral sequence (alternative ancestors) were\nalso reconstructed to verify the robustness of ASR\n63. Additionally, we\nalso used the joint reconstruction method to reconstruct the ancestral\nsequences, and the sequences from joint reconstruction are almost\nidentical to those from marginal reconstruction (Supplementary\nFigs. 18– 20). Furthermore, we also reconstructed the other phylo-\ngenetical tree of IREDs usingβ-hydroxyacid dehydrogenases as out-\ngroup sequences to support the study conclusions (Supplementary\nDiscussion).\nCloning, expression, and puriﬁcation of ancestral enzymes\nNdeIa n dXhoI restriction sites were incorporated at the N- and\nC-termini of ancestral genes. These genes were synthesized (Genscript\nCorporation, Nanjing, China), ampliﬁed and cloned into a pET28a(+)\nvector containing a six-His-tag at the N-terminus. All vectors contain-\ning the relevant codon-optimized genes were transformed into che-\nmically competentEscherichia colicells. Transformations were carried\nout aseptically by adding 1μL plasmids to 20μLo fE. colichemically\ncompetent cells and incubating on ice for 30 min. Cells were heat-\nshocked for 90 s at 42 °C, then placed back on ice for 90 s before the\naddition of 500μL of sterile Luria-Bertani (LB) media. Cells were then\nincubated for 40 min at 37 °C, 500μL of recovered cells was plated\nonto a 2% (w/v) LB agar plate containing kanamycin (50μg/mL), and\nplates were incubated overnight at 37 °C. Due to the addition of the six-\nHis-tag, several extra residues are also added in front of the N-terminus\nof target proteins. For crystallization of N559 and N559-M6, these extra\namino acids need to be removed. We usedXhoIa n dNcoI restriction\nenzymes to remove the extra amino acids at the N-terminus. The\nN-terminus changes from MGSSHHHHHHSSGLVPRGSHMSNN to\nMHHHHHHHMSNN. All sequences were con ﬁrmed by DNA\nsequencing.\nE. coli BL21(DE3) cells containing ancestral enzyme genes were\ngrown in 4 mL LB medium with 50μg/mL kanamycin for 12 h. A 1 mL\nsample of culture was then transferred into 100 mL Terriﬁc Broth with\n50 μg/mL kanamycin and cultured at 37 °C with shaking at 200 rpm for\n3 h. The temperature was decreased to 16 °C, cells were adjusted to the\nnew temperature for 10 min, and isopropyl β-D-1-\nthiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added to aﬁnal concentration of\n0.2 mM to induce protein expression. Cultures with IPTG were incu-\nbated at 16 °C for 24 h. Cells were harvested using a centrifuge at\n7826 ×g for 5 min at 4 °C and the supernatant was discarded. The cell\npellet was resuspended in puriﬁcation buffer A (20 mM NaPi,5 0 0m M\nNaCl, 10 mM imidazole, and 5 mM beta-mercaptoethanol), and cells\nwere lysed by ultrasonication.

The protein was then exchanged into a buffer comprising 20 mM\nNaPi, and 0.97 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) without imidazole. Protein\nconcentration was measured using a NanoDrop 2000 Spectro-\nphotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc, Waltham, USA) based on the\nabsorbance at 280 nm. The puriﬁed enzyme was subjected to bio-\ntransformation to examine stereoselectivity.\nN-terminally truncated proteins were cultured and puriﬁed under\nthe same conditions as normal proteins for crystallization of N559 and\nN559-M6. A further puriﬁcation step was carried out using an ÄKTA\npure instrument (Cytiva, Marlborough, USA). The protein solution\ncollected from the Ni\n2+ afﬁnity column was further puriﬁed by size-\nexclusion chromatography on a HiLoad 16/600 Superdex 75 pg col-\numn (Cytiva, Marlborough, USA). Theﬁnal protein solution was con-\ncentrated to 20 mg/mL for crystallization experiments.\nSite-directed mutagenesis\nAll point mutants of N559 and N560 were constructed via site-directed\nmutagenesis using primers listed in Supplementary Table 1 (Tsingke\nBiotechnology Company Limited, Shanghai, China). PCR mixtures\n(20 μL) contained 0.5μL forward and reverse primer, 0.5μL template\nplasmid, 0.5μL dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), 10μL PrimeSTAR HS Pre-\nmix (Takara Bio, Dalian, China), and 8μLd d H\n2O.

Each 500μL\nreaction mixture contained: 5 mM substrate, 1 mM NADP+,3 0 m M\nD-glucose, 2 mg/mL glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) enzyme powder,\n1 mg/mL puriﬁed enzyme, and 100 mM NaPi (pH = 7.0).

To calculate each intermediate’s speciﬁc\nactivity via conversion, the reaction times of 15 mutants were set to\n3 h (N559-A119G, N559-L19M/C67S, N559-T94S/A119G, N559-L19M/\nT94S, N559-T94S/I120V, N559-A119G/I120V, N559-L19M/T94S/A119G,\nN559-L19M/C67S/T94S/ N559-L19M/T94S/I120V, N559-L19M/C67S/\nT94S/I120V, N559-L19M/C67S/T94S/A119G, N559-C67S/T94S/A119G/\nI120V, N559-L19M/C67S/A119G/I120V, N559-T94S/A119G/I120V, and\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-024-54613-3\nNature Communications|        (2024) 15:10330 9\nN559-T94S/A119G/I120V), and the rest of the mutants were set to\n10 h. The other reaction conditions were the same as in the above-\nmentioned analytical-scale enzymatic reactions. Data were obtained\nfrom three replicate experiments.\nProtein crystallization of N559 and N559-M6\nPuriﬁed N559 and N559-M6 were subjected to crystallization trials\nusing commercially available screen kits in 96-well sitting-drop format,\nwith each drop comprising 1μL of protein solution containing 2.5 mM\nNADP\n+ and 1μL of reservoir solution. Crystallization and X-ray dif-\nfraction experiments yielded two structures: N559 in complex with\nNADP\n+ and N559-M6 in complex with NADP+. For further details see\nSupplementary Information.

{"text": "EngineeringMicrobiology2(2022)100023  \nContents lists available at ScienceDirect \nEngineering Microbiology \njournal homepage: www.elsevier.com/locate/engmic \nResearch Highlights \nMultifunctional biocatalysis: An unusual imine reductase \nFeifei Chen, Jianhe Xu, Gaowei Zheng ∗ \nState Key Laboratory of Bioreactor Engineering, Shanghai Collaborative Innovation Center for Biomanufacturing, East China University of Science and Technology, \nShanghai 200237, China \na r t i c l e i n f o \nKeywords: \nImine reductase \nBiocatalysis \nChiral amine \nConjugate reduction \nReductive amination \na b s t r a c t \nA multifunctional biocatalyst EneIRED capable of catalyzing amine-activated conjugate alkene reduction and \nsubsequent reductive amination was discovered. The enzyme realized the coupling of 𝛼, 𝛽-unsaturated carbonyls \nwith amines to eﬃciently synthesize a broad set of chiral amine diastereomers based on its unusual active site \nstructure and catalytic mechanism. \nStructurally diverse chiral amines are ubiquitous structural motifs \nin biologically active compounds such as natural products and drugs \n[ 1 , 2 ]. The eﬃcient synthesis of chiral amines has received signiﬁ- \ncant interest, as demonstrated by the development of various synthetic \nroutes involving diastereoisomeric crystallization, asymmetric reduc- \ntive amination of prochiral ketones, reduction of imines or enimines, \nand C-H amination [3] . Amino compounds typically contain more than \none stereogenic center, and their asymmetric synthesis with adequate \n(dia)stereoselectivity is challenging and usually requires tedious mul- \ntistep syntheses or intricated cascade catalysis systems [ 4 , 5 ]. Multi- \nenzymatic cascades provide new opportunities for preparing amino \ncompounds with multiple stereogenic centers, but their application is \nhampered by issues such as incompatibility in the reaction system, gen- \neration of byproducts, and complicated work-up [ 6 , 7 ]. Now, Turner and \ncollaborators have discovered a multifunctional biocatalyst EneIRED \nfrom a panel of metagenomic imine reductases (IREDs), which can cat- \nalyze both amine-activated conjugate reduction (CR) of alkenes and fol- \nlowing reductive amination (RA), thus achieving the coupling of 𝛼, 𝛽- \nunsaturated carbonyls with amines for the eﬃcient synthesis of diverse \nchiral amine diastereomers ( Fig. 1 ) [8] . \nIREDs are a family of NADPH-dependent enzymes and are involved \nin the reduction of C = N bonds and reductive amination of C = O bonds \n[9] . Furthermore, in a few cases, IREDs have been shown to catalyze \nthe direct reduction of C = O bonds to form corresponding alcohol prod- \nucts [10] . However, the biocatalytic reduction of C = C bonds was still an \nunexplored area for IREDs, whereas the reaction has typically been per- \nformed with ene-reductases (EREDs) [11] . After screening a total of 389 \nIREDs, including both reported and recently developed (meta)genomic \nIREDs [12] with a cyclic ene-imine as the model substrate, 44 enzymes \nwere found that could catalyze the asymmetric reduction of both the \nC = C and the C = N bonds of the model substrate. Among them, an IRED, \n∗ Corresponding author. \nE-mail address: gaoweizheng@ecust.edu.cn (G.

Less hindered \nenals and enones as well as amine nucleophiles tend to be converted \nwith good chemoselectivity to the corresponding saturated amine prod- \nucts. For example, coupling of ( E )-2-methyl-2-butenal with cyclopropy- \nlamine aﬀorded > 99% conversion to the saturated amine. Further- \nmore, unsubstituted and substituted cycloalkyl-2-enones with diﬀer- \nent ring sizes were well tolerated by the enzyme, aﬀording good con- \nversion and chemo- and stereoselectivity for many of the correspond- \ning CR–RA products. In particular, C 3 -substitutioned cyclohex-2-enone \nsubstrates were eﬃciently transformed to CR–RA products even when \ncoupled with diﬀerent amine partners ( e.g., NH 3 , methylamine, ally- \nlamine, propargylamine, n -butanamine, pyrrolidine, and ( R )- or ( S )-3- \nﬂuoropyrrolidine), yielding high conversion and chemo-, enantio- and \ndiastereoselectivity in many cases. The enzymatic CR-RA also demon- \nstrated great synthetic applicability, with 60–81% isolated yield for the \npreparative synthesis of the saturated amine products. In one case, 64% \nisolated yield was attained at a scale of 1.0 mmol. \nThe unusual function of EneIRED inspired the researchers to con- \nduct mechanistic investigations into the enzymatic catalysis. Isotopic \nlabelling experiments using regenerated deuterated nicotinamide cofac- \ntor to transform 3-methyl-2-cyclohexenone with cyclopropylamine as an \namine partner showed that hydride transfer occurs at the C-1 and C-3 po- \nsitions of the carbonyl substrate. A reaction time-course study and sev- \neral control experiments suggested that the enone substrate ﬁrst under- \ngoes CR to the corresponding ketone before transformation into the sat- \nurated amine via RA, and an ene-imine-NAD(P)H-biocatalyst complex \ncould be essential for EneIRED-catalyzed CR.

Consequently, structural features were observed \nin the active site compared to the other IREDs with released structures \nin the database, and residues Y177 and Y181 proved to play signiﬁcant \nroles in the CR-RA. Molecular docking of the enzyme with the result- \ning ene-imine intermediate suggests that the prochiral carbon atom of \nthe C = C bond is positioned at a suitable distance to transfer the hy- \ndride from the pyridinium ring of the cofactor. Based on mechanistic and \nstructural studies, an EneIRED catalytic cycle of CR-RA was delineated \nby the researchers ( Fig. 1 ). First, the nicotinamide cofactor NAD(P)H \nand the formed ene-imine intermediate from 𝛼, 𝛽-unsaturated carbonyl \nand amine partner are accepted in the active site of EneIRED, generat- \ning an ene-imine-NAD(P)H-enzyme complex. The hydride is then trans- \nferred from nicotinamide cofactor to the C-3 of the ene-imine due to its \nbeneﬁcial orientation, whereby CR occurs and generates the stereoen- \nriched 1-enamine-NAD(P) + -EneIRED complex. The prochiral 1-enamine \nand NAD(P) + are then released from the active site, and the former un- \ndergoes hydrolysis to the stereoenriched carbonyl. Subsequently, the in- \ntermediate imine is formed from the stereoenriched carbonyl and the \namine partner and complexed with the enzyme and nicotinamide cofac- \ntor NAD(P)H, which is transformed into the ﬁnal stereoenriched amine \nproduct via IRED-catalyzed RA. \nThe identiﬁcation of new enzymes and new activities of previously \ndiscovered enzymes plays a signiﬁcant role in extending the synthetic \nscope of biocatalysis and pushing forward its application in the manu- \nfacture of high-value chiral compounds [ 13 , 14 ]. Although the catalysis \nof IREDs, especially in the synthesis of chiral amines, has been widely \ninvestigated in the last decade [ 9 , 15–17 ], the identiﬁcation of the mul- \ntifunctional biocatalyst EneIRED provides new perspectives in the bio- \ncatalytic area due to this newly disclosed function for C = C reduction \n[8] . The CR-RA catalysis enabled by EneIRED in a one-pot, one-catalyst \nfashion provides a concise, green, and eﬃcient route to stereoenriched \namine products with multiple stereogenic centers. This is a signiﬁcant \ndiscovery that improves upon previously developed methods, consid- \nering the existing issues associated with cost, operational complexity, \nenvironmental impact, and product quality [4–7] . \nThe catalytic mechanism and chemoselectivity to imine reduction, \nreductive amination, and ketoreduction have been widely studied for \nIREDs with structural insights [ 15 , 17 , 18 ]. Nevertheless, the identiﬁca- \ntion of the new CR-RA function of IREDs with structural investigations \n2 \nF. Chen, J. Xu and G. Zheng Engineering Microbiology 2 (2022) 100023 \nsheds new light on understanding of the structure-activity relationships \nof the family of IREDs, which provides guidance for the laboratory evo- \nlution of the enzymes to enable the synthesis of structurally diﬀerent \nchiral amines of interest. The study will likely inspire further exploration \nor creation of new enzyme activities for other NAD(P)H-dependent en- \nzyme families ( e.g., amine dehydrogenases [ 19 , 20 ]) based on structural \nstudy and by virtue of advances in protein engineering [21] . \nDeclaration of Competing Interest \nThe authors declare that they have no known competing ﬁnancial \ninterests or personal relationships that could have appeared to inﬂuence \nthe work reported in this paper. \nAcknowledgments \nThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Founda- \ntion of China ( 22008068 , 21878085 ) and the China Postdoctoral Science \nFoundation ( 2020M671027 ). \nReferences \n[1] M.

Here, we report a versatile\nbiocatalytic route to access chiral 2,3-dihydroxy-1,4-diketones in\nhigh yields and up to gram scale using D -fructose-6-phosphate\naldolase (EcFSA). The utility of these compounds as synthons is\nexemplified in enzyme cascades with subsequent regio- and\nstereoselective enzymatic transamination to form densely function-\nalized homochiral 1-pyrrolines followed by chemical or enzymatic reduction to tetrasubstituted pyrrolidines.\n■\nINTRODUCTION\n1,4-Dicarbonyl compounds are versatile synthetic intermedi-\nates for the synthesis of heterocycles and bioactive fragments.\n1\n2,3-Disubstituted-1,4-diketones (1) are particularly valuable\nfor generation of highly functionalized heterocycles (Figure\n1A,B) including pyrroles,\n2,3\nthiophenes,\n4\npyridazines,\n5\npyrro-\nlidines (2 and 3), pyrrolines (4),\n6−8\nand furans (5).\n9,10\nThe\n1,4-diketone moiety is also present in natural products and can\nbe converted into pharmacophores such as sugar polyols,\ndiketone sugars or cyclopentenones (6, Figure 1).\n11−14\nIn comparison to 1,3- and 1,5-dicarbonyls, the synthesis of\n1,4-diketones is a challenging process due to the inherent\nmismatch in carbonyl polarity. Consequently, these com-\npounds are often synthesized by umpolung type chemistries\nthat leverage inverse carbonyl reactivity.\n1\nA classic example of\nthis approach is the Stetter reaction; a 1,4 conjugate addition\nof an aldehyde onto an α,β-unsaturated carbonyl which\nproceeds via an N-heterocyclic carbene intermediate. Recent\ndevelopments allow for enantioselective variants of this\nreaction and have proven to be a versatile tool for 1,4-\ndicarbonyl synthesis.\n1,15−18\nOther chemical approaches to\ndicarbonyls include radical additions,\n15,19,20\nenolate cou-\nplings\n21,22\nand alkene carbonylation.\n23\nOrganocatalytic aldol\nreactions have also recently been reported to allow access to a\npanel of chiral 2,3-disubstituted-1,4-diketones.\n24,25\nDespite the\nplethora of synthetic methodologies for preparation of 1,4-\ndicarbonyls, the stereoselective synthesis of 2,3-disubstituted\nnonsymmetrical 1,4-diketones with high enantiopurity remains\na significant challenge.\n1,15,17,26\nFurthermore, the requirement\nfor protection strategies hampers the synthesis and diversifi-\ncation of polyhydroxylated targets such as iminosugars 2, 3 and\n4 (Figure 1B).\nBiocatalysis is an attractive technology for the enantiose-\nlective synthesis of complex fragments without the need for\nprotecting groups.\n27,28\nEnzymatic catalysis of 1,4-dicarbonyl\nforming Stetter reactions was discovered using thiamine\ndiphosphate (ThDP)-dependent carboligases such as the\nbiosynthetic enzymes PigD and MenD.\n29,30\nIn these enzymes,\nthe umpolung reactive intermediate is generated by decarbox-\nylation of an α-keto acid (e.g., pyruvate or α-ketogluta-\nrate).\n29−33\nSimilar reactivity has also been described within\nbenzaldehyde lyase (BAL), another ThDP-dependent lyase\nthat typically catalyzes 1,2 additions similar to benzoin\nreaction.\n34\nChen et al. showed that benzaldehyde lyase was\ncapable of performing intramolecular Stetter additions to\nfurnish chroman-4-one scaffolds in good to excellent yields and\nenantiopurity. More recently, MacAulay et al. demonstrated\nthat conjugation of a thiamine-inspired N-heterocyclic carbene\nto a steroid carrier protein creates an artificial “Stetterase” from\nan otherwise inert protein scaffold.\n35\nEnzymatic, regiospecific\noxidation of sugars can also yield 1,4-diketones and\nketoaldehydes. In this way, a number of synthetic building\nblocks and potential artificial sweeteners have been synthe-\nsized.\n13,14,36\nThe synthetic approach developed in this work exploits D -\nfructose-6-phosphate aldolase (FSA) to generate a library of\n2,3-dihydroxylated-1,4-diketones from simple, achiral precur-\nsors (Figure 1C).

As illustrated by\nthe plant alkaloid natural products codonopsine and radic-\namine B (2 and 3, Figure 1B),\n8,49−51\nthese uncommon arylated\niminosugars (and their precursor imines, e.g., 4) are\nglycosidase inhibitors and antibiotics (MRSA).\n52,53\nSome\nanalogous compounds also inhibit nucleoside hydrolases,\nacting as C-nucleoside mimics.\n54,55\nBased on precedents for\nbiocatalytic synthesis of chiral aminopolyols and iminosu-\ngars;\n47,56,57\nthe diversification of the FSA derived compounds\nwith transaminase (TA) and imine reductase (IRED)\nbiocatalysts was explored (Figure 1C). However, the trans-\nformation of complex targets with multiple reactive centers and\nhydroxyl substituents is not trivial and strict regio- and\nstereochemical control would be key to success of this\nstrategy.\n47,48,58\nThe goals of this approach were: (i) to enable\nsynthetic diversity through exploration of enzyme substrate\nscope, (ii) to evaluate the synthetic versatility of intermediates,\nand (iii) to identify novel enzyme activity on challenging\npolyhydroxylated substrates.\n■\nRESULTS [TC16]AND DISCUSSION\nScreening of EcFSA for Activity toward Aryl Glyoxals.\nThe wild-type EcFSA was first evaluated for its activity in the\naldol addition of hydroxyacetone (HA, a) to phenylglyoxal 7.\nGood conversion (91%) was observed and the panel of\nelectrophile substrates was expanded(7−23, Figure 2A).\nAdditionally, dihydroxyacetone (DHA, b) and 1-hydroxybu-\ntan-2-one (HB, c) were screened as nucleophile substrates.\nBased on previous protein engineering work, EcFSA variant\nA129S was also screened, as it has shown improved conversion\nin reactions with DHA (b).\n59\nUPLC-QDa analysis of biotransformations showed good to\nhigh conversions (49−99%) for both EcFSA wt and A129S\nacross the panel of substrates with HA (a, Figure 2A) and\nmoderate conversions with DHA and HB (b 0−96% and c\n22−90%, Figure 2A). Prior work with these aldolases have\nshown that the structural and electronic influence of aryl\nmoieties can affect the acceptance of electrophile substrates.\n60\nIndeed, the only previous examples of FSA acting upon related\n2-oxoaldehydes utilize highly electrophilic 2-oxoalkanals as the\nelectrophilic substrate. The electrophile substrate scope of\nEcFSA tested herein was broad, and a range of functionality\nand substitution patterns were accepted (Figure 2A). Chemi-\ncally useful handles such as brominated and chlorinated\ncompounds 8, 12 and 13 showed higher conversions than the\nunsubstituted phenylglyoxal 7 and an azidated derivative (19)\nwas also well accepted. Free and methylated hydroxyl groups\nwere accepted (11, 15 and 16), as well as fluorinated\nderivatives (9, 10, 18, and 20). Surprisingly, the bulky 6-\nmethoxynaphthylglyoxal 21 was the best substrate, highlighting\nthe potential of EcFSA to generate diverse product libraries.\nThe nonarylated substrates, glyoxylic acid 22 and trifluoropyr-\nuvaldehyde 23, were also accepted, demonstrating a broader\nutility for the EcFSA-catalyzed synthesis of 1,4-keto acids and\nnonsymmetric-1,4-diketones bearing two different alkyl sub-\nstituents (Figure 2). No detrimental effects of the hydrate-\naldehyde equilibrium of the glyoxal substrates were observed\nsuggesting that the aldolase reaction has a sufficient driving\nforce to outcompete this equilibrium.\nPreparative-Scale Aldolase Reactions and Chiral\nAnalysis. Aldolase reactions were scaled up at increased\nsubstrate loading when feasible (100 mM with 10−20 v%\nDMSO). However, due to solubility limitations the scale up\nwas performed at 25 mM for 8 and 21 and 50 mM for 14.\nProducts were purified by extraction and column chromatog-\nraphy where necessary. Accordingly, aldol products 7a, 7c, 8a,\n9a, 14a, 20a, 21a and 22a were isolated in 51% to 93% yield\n(124 mg−1.15 g, Figure 2B). The chirality of aldol adducts 7a\nand 9a were confirmed to be the (2S,3S) stereoisomer by X-ray\ncrystallography (CCDC 2360546 and 2360547). This is\nconsistent with the FSA literature as C2 has inverted CIP\npriorities due to the adjacent ketone functionality. Chiral\nHPLC and NMR analysis of crude and purified products also\nindicates formation of a single major stereoisomer (Figures\nS32−S36). The electrophile scope and stereoselectivity of the\nreactions catalyzed by EcFSA are complementary to a reported\norganocatalytic method, while enabling the use of equimolar\nFigure 1.

The decision to screen trans-\naminase and reductase biocatalysts was bolstered by successful\nimplementation of these enzymes in concert in the literature,\nwhere chiral aminopolyols, γ-hydroxy-α-amino acids and\nvaluable heterocycles were synthesized.\n37,47,56,65−70\nHowever,\nthe question remained as to how applicable these strategies\nwould be on complex targets with multiple reactive centers and\nhydroxyl substituents.\nScreening of TA for Activity toward FSA Aldol\nProducts. A panel of transaminase biocatalysts was evaluated\nfor the transamination of the aldol adduct 7a.\n71−73\nA screen of\nbiotransformations was performed using 5 mM substrate 7a\nand 5 equiv of L -alanine as a common amine donor. Three\nenzymes, the commercial ATA 113 from Codexis, RhTA\n74\nfrom Rhodobacter sphaeroides and pQR2191 TA\n75\nfrom a\nhousehold drain metagenome were found to generate a new\nsignal in the\n1\nH NMR corresponding to the product 7ai in 11,\n15, and 37% conversion, respectively (SI Figures S39 and\nS40). The metagenomic transaminase pQR2191, which is\nknown to be active against pharmaceutically relevant cyclic\nketones and ketose sugars, was taken forward for reaction\noptimization and implementation into the FSA-TA cas-\ncade.\n75,76\nFigure 2. (A) EcFSA-catalyzed aldol addition of hydroxyketones into glyoxals and a heatmap of screening data for EcFSA (wild-type or A129S\nmutant) with electrophiles 7−23 and hydroxyacetone a, dihydroxyacetone b or 1-hydroxybutan-2-one c. Conversions are calculated from substrate\ndepletion by UPLC-QDa for 7−21 or NMR for 22 and 23. (B) Preparative reactions catalyzed by EcFSAwt. Reaction conditions: EcFSA lysate (2\nmg·mL\n−1\n), glyoxal substrate 7−23 (25 mM), hydroxyacetone (1 equiv. Twenty-five mM) in triethanolamine buffer (TEA, 100 mM, pH 8.0)\ncontaining 20 v% DMSO. Reactions were incubated at 30 °C for 24 h. Preparative reactions were performed with increased substrate loading as\nspecified.\nJournal of the American Chemical Society pubs.acs.org/JACS Article\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/jacs.4c16732\nJ. Am. Chem. Soc. 2025, 147, 6067−6075\n6069\nOptimization of the Transamination Step and FSA-\nTA Cascade Implementation. Following the promising\nresults from the preliminary screening, the transamination\nconditions for substrate 7a were subsequently optimized with\npurified pQR2191 TA. Throughout these experiments, the\nbuffer and reaction temperature were kept constant to ensure\ncompatibility of conditions in the planned FSA-TA cascade.\nAccording to the literature, the pQR2191 TA displays good\nactivity with isopropylamine (IPA) as the amine donor. The\nuse of this substrate results in a higher atom economy and a\nshift of the reaction equilibrium toward the amine product, due\nto the formation of volatile acetone as a byproduct.\n77−79\nA\nreaction conducted with low concentration of the catalyst and\nthe amine donor IPA leads to a promising initial yield of 26%\n(SI Table S5). Increasing the concentration of either the\nenzyme or IPA has a strong effect on the conversion, with\nreactions completed with 2 mg·mL\n−1\nof purified pQR2191 TA\nor 10 equiv of IPA. The reactions were monitored by\n1\nH\nNMR, where a characteristic shift of the methyl signal of the\nsubstrate (2.34 ppm, 3H, s) to a 3H doublet at 1.31 ppm\nindicates that the less hindered methyl ketone was aminated as\nexpected.\nThe FSA-TA cascade was subsequently investigated as either\na telescoped or sequential one-pot process (Figure 3 and SI\nTable S6). In the telescoped cascade all reaction components\nare added simultaneously, whereas in the sequential mode the\naldolase reaction is allowed to proceed for 24 h before addition\nof the transaminase reaction components. The conditions of\nthe FSA-TA cascade were optimized by varying enzyme\nconcentrations with a constant amount of IPA (SI Table S6).\nVery good conversions were achieved with the substrates\nphenylglyoxal 7 and hydroxyacetone a in both telescoped and\nsequential cascades. A telescoped reaction on 0.5 mmol scale\ngave an isolated yield of 74% of 7ai (Figure 3). HRMS analysis\nof transaminase product 7ai gave m/z = 192.1019,\ncorresponding to the [M + H]\n+\nof the cyclized 3,4-dihydro-\n2H-pyrrole (1-pyrroline) species 7ai.\n13\nC NMR revealed the\ndisappearance of one carbonyl environment, as expected with\nconversion a ketone to an amine and a shift of the other signal\nin the carbonyl region, further supporting the formation of the\ncyclic imine product 7ai. The presence of a single new doublet\npeak for the CH\n3\nsuggests that a single new diastereomer has\nbeen formed from the less hindered ketone in the substrate.\nThe\n3\nJ\nH−H\ncoupling constants along the C4−C5 and C3−C4\nbonds and comparison with known compounds suggest that\nthe protons on C4−C5 are cis to each other,\n80\nand the protons\non C3−C4 are trans, as expected from the aldolase derived\nstereochemistry for C3 & C4. Taken together, these data\nsuggest the formation of the S stereochemistry at the new\namine center in accordance with previous work with this\ntransaminase.\n75,76\nThe reported synthetic route to this analogous 2-aryl-1-\npyrroline iminosugar involves six synthetic steps and\nprotection of all hydroxyl groups of the starting material, D -\nribose. The key aryl moiety is introduced via an elegant\ntandem addition-cyclization of an aryl-Grignard reagent and\nthe D -ribose derived methanesulfonylglycononitrile.\n80\nCyclic\nsugar imines have also been accessed previously via chemo-\nenzymatic synthesis using DHAP-dependent aldolases and\nazidoaldehyde precursors as masked amine equivalents.\n81\nIn\ncontrast to the two methods described above, the FSA-TA\ncascade described herein can furnish sterechemically comple-\nmentary pyrrolines from diverse aryl glyoxals in a telescoped or\nsequential one-pot process without need of any protecting\ngroups.\nThe scope of the cascade was extended to encompass 1-\npyrroline products 8ai, 9ai, and 7ci (Figure 3 and SI Table\nS6). Interestingly, the sequential cascade yielded better results\nfor product 8ai in comparison to a telescoped sequence. This\ndifference might be explained by a substrate inhibition of the\ntransaminase, a high activity toward one of the substrates or a\nmismatch in relative rates of the aldolase and transaminase\ncatalysts in the telescoped sequence. Nevertheless, 8ai was\nisolated in a 30% yield from the sequential cascade. Sequential\nand telescoped cascades gave good conversions and isolated\nyields for 6ai. Unfortunately, low conversions were observed\nfor the product 7ci on analytical scale. In this case, an ethyl\ngroup has to be accommodated in the small pocket of the\nbinding site of the transaminase, which is commonly reported\nto be a challenge for wild-type enzymes of this class.\n82−87\nThe\nscreening or engineering of transaminases with expanded\nsubstrate scope toward these bulky substrates would further\nexpand the synthetic potential of this approach.\nReduction of Biocatalytically Synthesized Pyrrolines\nand Screening of Imine Reductases. Polyhydroxlated\nsubstrates are known to be challenging for typical imine\nreductases due to the polarity of the enzyme active site\narchitecture or potential interference of promiscuous alcohol\ndehydrogenase activity giving rise to false positive hits or\nundesirable byproducts.\n47,48,58\nIn the course of investigations\nFigure 3.

Soc. 2025, 147, 6067−6075\n6070\ntoward diversification of the FSA derived diketones, a panel of\n384 metagenomic IREDs was screened against diketone 9a for\nreductive amination with cyclopropylamine. This screen\nreturned only a handful of enzymes exhibiting trace product\nformation (<5% by UPLC-QDa, SI Figures S143 and S144),\nsupporting the hypothesis that the densely functionalized\nstructures explored in this work are challenging substrates for\nIREDs. As such, a targeted panel of previously characterized\nIREDs and RedAms were rationally selected based on related\nliterature substrate scope and screened for activity against the\n3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrole (1-pyrroline) product 7ai (Figure 4\nand SI Figure S60).\n47,48,58,63,88,89\nThe chemical reduction of pyrroline 7ai was achieved by\ntreatment with NH\n3\nBH\n3\nafter an initial, unsuccessful attempt\nwith NaCNBH\n3\nleft 7ai unreacted. Accordingly, NH\n3\nBH\n3\nmediated imine reduction provided the pyrrolidine product\n7aii in 99% yield (as measured by\n1\nH NMR) as a mixture of\ntwo diastereomers (6:4 d.r., Figure 4). The identified\nreductases were first screened against 7ai using QDa mass\nspectrometry, whereby three enzymes, AniN6, NhIRED and\nAdRedAm, appeared to give rise to a new species with m/z\n194, corresponding to the pyrrolidine product 7aii (Figure\nS61).\nReductase biotransformations were subsequently monitored\nby\n1\nH NMR which showed that AdRedAm provided 31%\nNMR yield after 24 h, and 59% after 48 h and a second enzyme\naddition, and NhIREDafforded 30% of amine product after 48\nh and two enzyme additions. Interestingly, the major\ndiastereomer formed with both enzymes corresponds to the\nminor diastereomer formed upon chemical reduction. No\nconversion was observed in biotransformations with AniN6 by\n1\nH NMR. Attempts to increase product formation by\nincreasing enzyme loading and reaction time to 2.5 mg·mL\n−1\nand 48−72 h were unsuccessful. The reaction with AdRedAm\nconducted at a larger scale (5 mL) was significantly slower\nthan at analytical (0.5 mL) scale, as seen in previous work with\nthis enzyme on challenging substrates.\n63\nSimilarly, attempts to\nincorporate AdRedAm into the FSA-TA cascade established\nabove were not fruitful, with only 9−12% conversion to\npyrrolidine seen by\n1\nH NMR (Table S9).\nPrevious synthetic methods toward comparable compounds\nin this class of 2-aryl pyrrolidine iminosugars generally involve\nlong synthetic sequences, multiple protection strategies and\nreliance upon chiral pool reagents.\n8,52,91−93\nFor example, El-\nNezhawy et al. developed an eight step synthesis of diverse\ncodonopsine analogs from D -tartaric acid,\n8\nthe group of Behr\nhave demonstrated the synthesis of 2-aryl pyrroline and\npyrrolidine iminosugars from D -ribose in seven to 11 steps\nusing Grignard reagents to introduce the key aryl moiety.\n52,80\nSimilarly, Toyao et al. used a key Grignard addition to furnish\n(−)-codonopsinine from L -lyxose via a sugar derived nitrone in\n11 steps.\n91\nA more concise synthesis of (−)-codonopsinine was\ndescribed by Reddy et al.,\n93\nwhere six synthetic steps from D -\nalanine furnish the pyrrolidine scaffold via asymmetric\nSharpless dihydroxylation and acid catalyzed amidocyclisation.\nIn comparison, at present our methodology provides one-\npot access to 2-aryl pyrroline iminosugars without need of any\nprotecting groups. Preliminary findings indicate that reductive\naminases or a chemical reduction are capable of furnishing the\n2-aryl pyrroline scaffold in a further synthetic step albeit with\nimperfect stereocontrol. Despite the inability to perform\npreparative synthesis of the pyrrolidine iminosugars using\nthese wild-type reductases, the stereoselectivity (d.r. 9:1)\nobserved in biotransformations with AdRedAm is promising. It\nis anticipated that protein engineering or directed evolution of\nAdRedAm could provide a more synthetically utile biocatalyst\ncapable of reducing these challenging substrates but such\nefforts are outside the scope of this work.\n■\nCONCLUSIONS\nThe enzymatic synthesis of chiral 2,3-dihydroxy-1,4-dicarbon-\nyls, which are versatile synthons for the synthesis of highly\nfunctionalized (hetero)cyclic scaffolds from simple, achiral\nprecursors is described. D -Fructose-6-phosphate aldolase from\nEscherichia coli (EcFSA) is shown to catalyze the synthesis of a\ndiverse library of arylated-1,4-diketones and a dihydroxy-1,4-\nketo acid with remarkable efficiency. Preparative reactions\nprovide good product yields and XRD analysis identified the\n2S,3S enantiomer, which is consistent with FSA stereochemical\noutcome reported in the literature. Furthermore, the down-\nstream synthetic potential of these compounds is exemplified.\nThe identification and implementation of an (S)-selective\ntransaminase enables the cascade synthesis of chiral 2-aryl-1-\npyrroline iminosugars with three new stereocenters in a regio-\nand stereoselective manner. Finally, preliminary findings\nsuggest that the fungal reductive aminase AdRedAm is a\npromising candidate for protein engineering or directed\nevolution of a stereoselective iminosugar imine reductase. By\nidentifying and engineering stereocomplementary enzymes, we\nanticipate that this procedure will provide a platform for\nexploring the structure−activity relationships of highly\nfunctionalized hydroxylated heterocycles and developing new\npharmaceutically relevant fragments.\nFigure 4.

Their synthetic versatility is, however, limited by their substrate scope, and new\nIREDs are needed. Current IREDs are closely related to the initially characterized enzymes, as their discovery\nhas been driven by sequence homology searches. Here, we demonstrate afunctional genomics approach\nbased on biosynthetic promiscuity, guided by the identiﬁcation of C=N reducing enzymes acting on large,\ncomplex substrates in biosynthetic pathways. These substrate-promiscuous biocatalysts share low homol-\nogy to existing IREDs and fall into distinct functional enzyme families, yet they catalyze the hydrogenation of\nnon-native imines as well as the reductive amination of simple ketones. Venturing further into sequence\nspace without the constraints of close homology, but instead guided by functional promiscuity, has thus\nled us to distinct, previously unrecognized and unexplored areas of sequence space for mining IREDs for\nsynthesis.\nINTRODUCTION\nImine reductases (IREDs) have emerged as important members\nof the catalyst toolkit for the synthesis of chiral amine building\nblocks. IREDs (including the closely related subclass of reduc-\ntive aminases [RedAms]) catalyze the NAD(P)H-dependent\nenantioselective reduction of imines and reductive amination of\ncarbonyl compounds, allowing access to primary, secondary,\nand tertiary chiral amines.\n1,2 Compared with other conven-\ntional methods (e.g., chemo-catalytic and transaminase-based\nroutes), IRED-catalyzed reductive amination reactions often\nenable greener and shorter synthetic routes to 2 /C14and 3 /C14chiral\namines by providing a direct and selective pathway to these\namines without a further N-alkylation step.\n3,4 A transaminase\nroute, for instance, can only form 1 /C14amines, and further N-alkyl-\nation step(s) and toxic reagents are required to access the\ncorresponding 2\n/C14and 3 /C14amine derivatives. 5 Abiotic reductive\namination reactions, on the other hand, suffer from poor\nTHE BIGGER PICTURE Making enzymatic synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) sustainable\nand attractive for industrial applications requires a repertoire of enzymes with activities and selectivities that\nsurpass those of chemical synthesis methods. Reductive amination (RA) is one of the most frequently em-\nployed methods to synthesize amine-based APIs, so the use of imine reductases (IREDs) for this transforma-\ntion is extremely attractive: catalytic reactions are performed with high efﬁciency and high stereoselectivity\nunder mild conditions. Secondary and tertiary amines that are not accessible by other enzymatic methods\ncan be synthesized in this way. However, the versatility of IRED-catalyzed reductive amination is limited\nby their substrate scope, so new IREDs to bridge gaps in speciﬁcity will increase the broad application of\nIREDs. Here, we explore a functional genomic approach to retrieve and characterize enzymes catalyzing un-\nrelated physiological imine reduction reactions across several metabolic routes, revealing their promiscuity\nfor the reductive amination of synthetic substrates. Our work has uncovered six useful enzyme families for\nimine reduction in previously unannotated sequence space, where their functional assignment creates\n‘‘bridgeheads’’ for further searches for IREDs.\nChem Catalysis 4, 101160, December 19, 2024 ª 2024 The Author(s).

In addition,\nchemical reductive amination methods employing stoichio-\nmetric amounts of reducing reagents (such as NaBH\n4,\nNaBH(OAc)3, and NaBH 3CN) produce large quantities of unde-\nsired boronic or cyanide by-products. 6 Specialized and poten-\ntially hazardous equipment setups and high catalyst loadings\nare usually necessary in transition-metal-catalyzed reductive\namination reactions where hydrogenation is performed with di-\nhydrogen gas (using H\n2/transition metal systems).\nSince chiral amines are among the most important building\nblocks in the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients\n(APIs), asymmetric amine-forming catalytic systems such as\nthose afforded by IREDs are highly sought after. Recent examples\nof successful industrial exploitation of IRED/RedAm technol-\nogy\n7–10 demonstrate considerable interest in this enzyme family.\nThis translational success fuels the motivation to establish the bio-\ncatalytic IRED route as a mainstream method of choice for the\nasymmetric reductive amination of carbonyl compounds. To\nrealize this ambition, the narrow substrate scope of IREDs must\nbe signiﬁcantly expanded, as several frequently used reductive\namination substrates, such as aromatic/bulky ketones and\namines, are only poorly tolerated by existing IRED toolkits.\n1,11,12\nThis problem notwithstanding, the effort devoted to the char-\nacterization of synthetically useful IREDs has been remarkable,\nwith several academic and industry groups contributing to the\nﬁeld. These efforts have, over the past decade, yielded hundreds\nof experimentally characterized IREDs ( Figure 1A). The availabil-\nity of Streptomyces’ IREDs as query sequences, identiﬁed\nthrough the screening of microbial cultures,\n13–15 paved the\nway for several genome mining IRED discovery projects in which\nputative bacterial homologs were identiﬁed by sequence homol-\nogy and experimentally validated. 16–22 Through sequence ho-\nmology search, several homologs of the characterized enzymes\nwere assembled to construct the IRED Engineering Database. 23\nOthers have assessed the distribution of IREDs across different\ntaxa, opening up fungal, plant, and metazoan IRED sequence\nspace.1,11,22 Lastly, a sequence-based metagenomic approach\nhas recently been explored to further expand the IRED\ntoolbox\n24,25 (Figure 1 A). The aforementioned IRED discovery\nstrategies have relied on sequence homology to the extent that\nthe vast majority of known IREDs are closely related, homolo-\ngous proteins. The narrowly deﬁned sequence window implies\nthat they share similar functional, catalytic, or synthetic proper-\nties and limitations or potential for directed evolution. It is, there-\nfore, not surprising that the hugely expanded IRED toolbox has\nnot yet translated to a signiﬁcant extension of the substrate\nscope of this enzyme class, highlighting the need for a discovery\neffort that is not driven by sequence homology alone but instead\nprimarily by function. Exploration of alternative enzyme families\nthat catalyze imine reduction has been considered with some\npromising results,\n22,26,27 but an extensive functional investiga-\ntion of multiple distinct enzyme families for biocatalytic applica-\ntion as IREDs is not on record.\nThis work addresses whether IREDs can be found using a\nsequence-independent strategy to reveal functional proteins in\nphylogenetically distinct sequence space that transcends the\ncurrently narrow sequence deﬁnition of contemporary IREDs.\nSpeciﬁcally, our strategy explores enzymes that have been\nshown to reduce theC=N bond of biosynthetic intermediates in\ndifferent biosynthetic/metabolic pathways across almost all\nclades of life. Even though biosynthetic enzymes are often\nperceived to display strict substrate speciﬁcity toward their\nnative substrates,\n28–31 catalytic and substrate promiscuity is a\nrecognized, intrinsic property of many enzymes that allow\nthem to act on alternative substrates, as an evolutionary ‘‘head\nstart’’ en route to the acquisition of a new function after gene\nduplication.\n32–34 Here, we systematically explore whether such\nC=N bond-reducing enzymes are promiscuous toward non-\nnative imine substrates relevant for IRED applications and\nwhether this search, only driven by a functional but not\nsequence-deﬁned search proﬁle, would uncover novel IREDs\nin areas of sequence space that is remote from the current clus-\nter of known IREDs. Our approach involves (1) the selection of\nfunctionally and phylogenetically divergent enzyme families\nbased on their recorded physiological role as NAD(P)H-depen-\ndent C=N reductases in the literature, regardless of sequence\nhomology, (2) a preference for reductases that work on relatively\nlarge substrate molecules in the center of which the C=N reduc-\ntion occurs (to bias for a large binding site able to accept bulky\nIRED substrates, for which few catalysts exist), and (3) experi-\nmental testing of recruited sequences per each selected func-\ntional family to determine the number of hits for each selected\nfunctional family, their activity, and their stereoselectivity. For\neach selected family, an average of seven sequences with vary-\ning degrees of sequence identity (35%–80%) were screened.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nConstruction of a diverse enzyme collection\nWe identiﬁed a panel of 44 phylogenetically diverse C=N\nreducing enzymes covering a wide range of functional families,\neach with distinct native imine substrate speciﬁcity ( Figures 1 B\nand S1; Table S1 ; supplemental information ). Speciﬁcally the\npanel comprises enzymes acting on pterin 1 and pteridine 2\nsuch as (1) dihydrofolate reductases (DHFRs) and (2) pteridine\nreductases (PTR1s; PruAs), respectively; (3) short-chain dehy-\ndrogenases (SDRs) catalyzing C=N bond (instead of C=O)\nreduction in the biosynthesis of plant alkaloids, e.g., norcraugso-\ndine 3\n35–39; and (4) bacterial enzymes including naphthyridino-\nmycin biosynthetic enzyme (NAPW) and homologs catalyzing\nC=N reduction of the iminium precursors of tetrahydroisoquino-\nline (THIQ) antibiotics, e.g., naphthyridinomycin iminium 4.\n40\nOthers include (5) imino acid reductases such as those cata-\nlyzing C=N reduction in the metabolism of acyclic imino acids,\ne.g., iminosuccinate 5,\n28,41 as well as those catalyzing the red-\nuction of cyclic imino acids, e.g., 1-peperideine/pyrroline-2-\ncarboxylate 6.42–44 (6) Lastly, representatives of the ‘‘classical’’\nIRED family catalyzing imine reduction in biosynthetic pathways.\nFor example, RedE, an uncharacterized metagenomic IRED-like\nbiosynthetic enzyme acting on pyrrole/pyrrolinium indolocarba-\nzole core 7, a precursor of tryptophan dimer natural product,\n45\nas well as related homologs from Antarctica (from Mortierella\nantarctica [MaRedAm]) and a tropical habitat (from a metage-\nnomic bacterium [ BacRedAm]).\n2 Chem Catalysis 4, 101160, December 19, 2024\nArticle\nll\nOPEN ACCESS\nA cladogram of these divergent sequences reveals distinct\nclusters (Figure 2A), namely clades 1–6, with each clade contain-\ning further monophyletic group(s) (e.g., clades 3a, 3b, and 3c and\nclades 6a, 6b, and 6c).

These plas-\nmids were each expressed in E. coliBL21(DE3) to produce re-\ncombinant whole-cell biocatalysts ( supplemental information ;\nFigures S20 and S21). A preliminary screening for NAD(P)H-\ndependent imine-reducing activity was performed by monitoring\nthe high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) conversion\nof the imine 1-methyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinoline 8 to the corre-\nsponding amine 9 and/or bioreduction of myosmine 10 to norni-\nA\nB\nFigure 2.

In\naddition, isoquinolines and pyrrolidines are\nprevalent motifs in many pharmaceuticals.\nAnalysis of biotransformation reactions\nrevealed that /C2460% of the biosynthetic en-\nzymes from functionally diverse classes dis-\nplayed imine-reducing activity on one or\nboth non-native imine substrates 8 and 10\n(Figure 2 B), although group-speciﬁc hit\nrates ranged from 0% to 100%. Of the eight\nmembers investigated from clade 1 (REDE\nhomologs, the classical IREDs), all displayed\nimine-reducing activity toward 8 or 10,\nrepresenting a 100% hit rate. In contrast,\nonly two members, PjDHFR from Pneumo-\ncystis jirovecii (fungal) and GgDHFR from Gallus gallus (avian),\nof the eight screened from clade 2 (DHFRs) displayed weak\nimine-reducing activity toward 8, equivalent to a 25% hit rate.\n87% (13) of the 15 members of clade 3 (PTR1s, norcraugsodine\nreductases [NRs], and NAPW-like enzymes) converted either 8\nor 10 to the corresponding amine. The protozoan PTR1s and\nNRs from plants afforded moderate conversions, with the other\nhits in this clade only displaying weak activity ( Figure 2 B).\nSix members of clades 4 and 5 were screened, but no detect-\nable product was observed under the biotransformation condi-\ntions based on HPLC analysis. For clades 6a and 6c (imino\nacid reductases), six members were also screened, of which\n66% displayed weak imine-reducing activity toward 8. These\ninclude the acyclic imino acid reductase PunC5/BsP5 from Pae-\nnibacillus sp./Bacillus sp., iminosuccinate reductase PbBcHD\nfrom Paracoccus denitriﬁcans, and the mammalian ketimine\nreductase mu-crystallin (CRYM). It is worth mentioning that\n4 Chem Catalysis 4, 101160, December 19, 2024\nArticle\nll\nOPEN ACCESS\nsome of these enzymes (e.g., DHFRs, NAPW, PunC5, BsP5)\nwere unstable and enzymatic imine-reducing activity appears\nto vary with each enzyme batch. Native amine dehydrogenases\n(NatAmDHs) that form a distinct branch (6b) within clade 6 were\nexcluded from this study, as signiﬁcant effort has recently been\ndevoted to their biocatalytic exploitation.\n24,48\nUsing semi-puriﬁed enzyme preparations, we examined the\nstereoselectivity of selected representatives of clades 1, 2, 3,\nand 6 toward the reduction of imines 8 and 10 (Table 1 ). RedE\ndisplayed weak activity toward 8 but efﬁciently reduced myos-\nmine 10 to the corresponding S-nornicotine 11 (90% conv.,\n>99% enantiomeric excess [ e.e.]), while related homologs\nMaRedAm, BacRedAm, and and the reductive aminase from\nAspergillus sergii (AserRedAm) efﬁciently reduced 8 to the ( R)-\namine 9 (>99% conv., 48%–92% e.e.). BacRedAm and MaRe-\ndAm also efﬁciently converted 10 to the ( S)-amine (>99%\nconv.), whereas AserRedAm displayed weaker activity toward\nthis substrate.\nProtozoan PTR1s from kinetoplastid parasites, including from\nTrypanosoma brucei (TbPTR1), T. cruzi (TcPTR1), Leishmania\nmajor (LmPTR1), and L. tarentolae (LtPTR1), reduced both 8\nand 10. While LmPTR1 and TbPTR1 reduced 8 to the corre-\nsponding ( S)-9, albeit in moderate to low e.e. (13%–54% e.e.),\nTcPTR1 and LtPTR1 produced the corresponding ( R)-amine in\nexcellent enantioselectivity (up 96% e.e.). The PTR1s all yielded\nthe ( R)-11 from the reduction of 10,\nirrespective of their selec-\ntivity toward amine 9. The avian DHFR ( GgDHFR) reduced 8 to\n(R)-9 (97% conv., >98% e.e.), but no conversion of 9 to 10 could\nbe detected.\nThe plant alkaloid-forming biosynthetic enzyme NR ( NpNR\nfrom Narcissus pseudonarcissus), which has been previously\ninvestigated for imine reduction of other cyclic imine sub-\nstrates,19 and homologs from Zephyranthes treatiae(ZtNR) and\nLycoris radiata (LrNR) afforded high conversion of 8 to ( R)-9,\nalbeit with poor e.e. values. However, ZtNR and NpNR displayed\nstereo-complementary selectivity for the reduction of imine 10,\nyielding ( S)-11 (30% e.e.) and ( R)-11 (28% e.e.), respectively.\nAn alkaloid-forming bacterial dehydrogenase, NAPW-like pro-\ntein from Paenibacillus sp. ( PbSDR), formed ( S)-11 from 10\n(68% conv., 91% e.e.). Representatives of (a)cyclic imino acid\nreductase, including Homo sapiens ketimine reductase mu-crys-\ntallin (hsCRYM), Punc5, and imminosuccinate reductase ( b- hy-\ndroxyaspartate cyclodeaminase from Paracoccus denitriﬁcans,\nPdBhCD), yielded ( R)-9 with near-perfect selectivity (>98%\ne.e.); however, substrate 10 was barely converted by hsCRYM\nand PunC5 (<3% conv.). Control reactions with stoichiometric\namounts of NAD(P)H conﬁrmed the IRED activity and showed\na similar trend to the observed activity when using a glucose de-\nhydrogenase (GDH)-recycling system (see supplemental infor-\nmation and Table S2 ).\nAll the enzymes investigated in this work displayed a prefer-\nence for NADPH, although NADH was also accepted, and in\nsome cases, e.g., MaRedAm, LtPTR1, ZtNR, and AmIRED,\nshowed comparable conversion with both cofactors. The pH\nproﬁle for the imine-reducing activity of selected enzymes\nshowed optimal activity at pH between 6 and 7, with most of\nthe enzymes also maintaining high activity at pH 5 (see supple-\nmental information and Figure S6 ). Activity at weakly acidic pH\ncan be useful when handling substrates that are labile at basic\npH7 and in cascade reactions involving (de)carboxylases. 50,51\nTo further examine the synthetic potential of members of PTR1\nand NR families and benchmarking against members of the clas-\nsical IRED family, we performed biotransformations at higher\nsubstrate loading for the reduction of cyclic imines 8 (100 mg\npreparative scale, 25 mM, 28 mL reaction) and 10 (25 mM,\n1 mL reaction), as well as for bulkier imines, salsolidine imine\n12 (10 mM, 1 mL reaction) and harmaline 14 (10 mM, 1 mL reac-\ntion) ( Table 1 B). At this elevated substrate loading, the PTR1s,\nNRs, and IREDs retained moderate to high conversion values\nfor imines 8 and 10 (32% to >99% conv.) to the corresponding\nenantioenriched products 9 and 11 (Table 1 B). Isolated yields\nand e.e. values for the preparative-scale reactions for the reduc-\ntion 8 to ( R)-9 were 92% yield, 95% e.e.; 25% yield, 98% e.e.;\nand 30% yield, 24% e.e. for MaRedAm-catalyzed, LtPTR1-\ncatalyzed, and ZtNR-catalyzed reactions, respectively. For the\nreduction of imines 12 and 14, a difference in substrate tolerance\ncould be observed within members of the same family. For\nexample, LtPTR1 showed moderate conversion (41%) toward\n12, yielding ( R)-13 (>98% e.e.), but only weak or trace activity\ncould be detected with TbPTR1 and LmPTR1 with the same sub-\nstrate. Harmaline 14 was reduced to the corresponding amine\n(S)-15, albeit in low conversion values (6%–18%).\nThe plant enzyme Z tPTR1 was efﬁcient toward the reduction\nof salsolidine imine 12 (>99% conv., 38% e.e. [ S]) and harmaline\n14 (97% conv., 89% e.e. [R]), while NpNR displayed a slower\nconversion rate with these substrates. Similar trends were\nobserved with the classical IREDs. MaRedAm efﬁciently reduced\nimine 12, affording the corresponding amine ( R)-13 (>99% conv.,\n>98% e.e.), but displayed poor activity toward imine 25\n(6% conv.). In contrast, BacRedAm reduced 14 to form ( S)-15\nin excellent conversion and e.e. (93% conv., 98% e.e.) but only\nshowed weak activity toward the reduction of imine 12.\nThe protein sequence space shown to harbor enzymes with\nimine-reducing activity from this work extends far beyond the\nclassical deﬁnition of the IRED sequence space. For example,\nsequences included in the IRED Engineering Database ( www.\nired.biocatnet.de), which provides the most extensive coverage\nof currently known IREDs (>1,400 sequences), fall in their entirety\nunder clade 1 ( Figure 2A).\n23 Indeed, a BLAST search against this\ndatabase using any member of clade 1 as a query sequence re-\nturns hits with signiﬁcant homology scores. However, a similar\nhomology search using representative sequences of all other\nclades 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 scanned against the IRED Engineering\nDatabase did not return any hits, indicating that the ﬁve other\ndistinct enzyme families (clades) described here cover new\nground: i.e., are sequence diverse and phylogenetically distinct\nfrom known IREDs. This test suggests that the new clades will\nprovide the basis for a signiﬁcant extension of IRED diversity\nby functional annotation of proteins in sequence space that act\non synthetic imine substrates as IREDs or provide a starting\npoint for their directed evolution.\nApplication of representative members in reductive\namination\nEncouraged by the activity of members of clade 3 on isoquinoline\nand pyrroline imines and the high imine-reducing hit rate of this\nChem Catalysis 4, 101160, December 19, 2024 5\nArticle\nll\nOPEN ACCESS\nTable 1.

The reaction was incubated at 20 /C14C for 12–48 h. n.t., not tested; N/D, product not detected.\nChem Catalysis 4, 101160, December 19, 2024 7\nArticle\nll\nOPEN ACCESS\nconv., 18a–18c, 53%–94% conv., 19a and 19c, 74%–89%\nconv.), and comparable conversion values were obtained with\nBacRedAm (Table 2). Similar conversion values were also obse-\nrved with 4-phenylcyclohexanone 20 (10 mM), with MaRedAm\nand BacRedAm efﬁciently coupling amines a and c to form the\ncorresponding amine products 20a (89%–93% conv.) and 20c\n(71%–80% conv.), respectively.\nMembers of the PTR1s (clade 3c) displayed similar substrate\ntolerance to MaRedAm and BacRedAm. LtPTR1, in many cases,\nafforded comparable conversion values with the prototype\nRedAms (e.g., 16a, 78% conv.; 17a, 87% conv.; 18a, 82%\nconv.; 19a, 45% conv.; 20a, 53% conv.), whereas TbPTR1 and\nLmPTR1 yielded these products but in lower conversion values.\nOther alkylamines, such as cyclopropylamine b and methylamine\nc, were also accepted by LtPTR1 as amine nucleophiles,\nfurnishing the corresponding amine products in modest conver-\nsion values. MaRedAm-catalyzed amination of 16 (50 mM) with\nNH3 d (supplied as 200 mM NH 4Cl) afforded 90% conv. to the pri-\nmary amine 16d, while conversion values were signiﬁcantly lower\nwith BacRedAm ( 16d, 15% conv.) and LtPTR1 ( 16d, 8% conv.).\nThese enzymes also formed 4-phenylcyclohexylamine 20d\nfrom 4-phenylcyclohexanone 20 and NH 3, d (20d, MaRedAm,\n32% conv.; BacRedAm, 30% conv.; and LtPR1, 14% conv.).\nThe plant enzymes (clade 3b) ZtNR and NpNR displayed activ-\nity toward the amination of 16–18 with propargylamine a, afford-\ning the corresponding N-alkylated propargylamine products\n16a–18a, albeit with signiﬁcantly lower conversion values. How-\never, both enzymes could not use ammonia or the small alkyl-\namine MeNH 2 and showed weak activity toward amination of\n16 with cyclopropylamine b (ZtNR, 16b, 5% conv.) ( Table 2 ).\nPreparative-scale biotransformation reactions for the amina-\ntion of cyclohexanone 16 (100 mg, 1.02 mmol, total reaction vol-\nume, 41 mL) with 2 equiv of propargylamine a were performed,\nyielding the corresponding secondary amine 16a (84% yield\nfor MaRedAm-catalyzed reaction and 63% yield for LtPTR1-\ncatalyzed reaction).\nTo examine the pattern of substrate speciﬁcity for both\ncarbonyl and amine coupling partners, we carefully constructed\na small substrate panel containing ketones 16 and 22, aldehyde\n21, a-keto ester 23, and a-keto acids 24 and 25 as carbonyl ac-\nceptors, and propargylamine a, cyclopropylamine b, methyl-\namine c, and ammonia d were included as the amine coupling\npartners (Table 3). Using puriﬁed enzyme preparation, represen-\ntative members of clades 1, 2, 3, 5, and 6 were each screened\nagainst the various substrate combinations of this substrate\npanel, monitoring the NADPH-dependent reductive amination\ninitial rate at 340 nm using a microtiter plate reader ( Table 3 ).\nMaRedAm (clade 1) was the most versatile of these catalysts,\ndisplaying high to moderate activity for the ketone/aldehyde\nand alkylamine combinations, with speciﬁc activity of up to\n11.6 U mg\n/C01. MaRedAm-catalyzed reductive amination activity\nwas one order of magnitude lower when ammonia was used\ninstead of alkylamines ( Table 3). MaRedAm also exhibited reduc-\ntive amination activity toward the a-keto ester 23 and a-keto\nacids, 24 and 25, albeit two orders of magnitude slower relative\nto the rates observed with cyclohexanone/hydrocinnamalde-\nhyde and alkylamines. LtPR1, a representative from clade 3c,\nshowed similar amine speciﬁcity to MaRedAm. However, reac-\ntion velocities were 10- to 100-fold slower when compared\nwith MaRedAm for the same substrate combinations. Activity to-\nward a-keto acids was not detected under the screening condi-\ntions. Pseudomonas putida ketimine reductase ( PpDpka)\nshowed similar amine substrate speciﬁcity to MaRedAm but\ndistinct speciﬁcity for the carbonyl acceptor. PpDpka exhibited\nhigh speciﬁc activity toward the amination of a-keto ester 23\nand a-keto acids 24 and 25 with alkylamines (up to 5 U mg /C01);\nactivity toward ketones 16 and 22 and aldehyde 21 was not de-\ntected under the conditions of this assay. HsCRYM (clade 6c),\nPunC5 (clade 6a), and the avian DHFR ( GgDHFR, clade 6a) dis-\nplayed activity for a-keto acids/esters with alkylamines and, in\nsome cases, ammonia (e.g., PunC5); however, methylamine c\nwas the preferred alkylamine nucleophile for these substrates.\nThe screening against this carefully designed, albeit small,\nsubstrate panel has revealed that several non-homologous\nenzyme families investigated can catalyze reductive amination\nwith primary amines to form N-alkylamines, N-alkylamino esters,\nand N-alkylamino acids ( Table 3 ). Hence constructing IRED\npanels to contain representative members from these distinct\nand non-homologous enzyme families should signiﬁcantly\nextend the amine product scope that can be accessed\ncompared to conventional IRED kits.\nTo demonstrate the utility of observed activities for biotrans-\nformation reactions, we focused on PTR1s and NRs (again\nbenchmarking against the classical IREDs in clade 1) for the\nreductive amination of hydrocinnamaldehyde 21 (30 mM), benz-\naldehyde 26 (10 mM), and a prochiral ketone, 4-phenyl-2-\nbutanone 22 (10 mM). PTR1s efﬁciently catalyzed the amination\nof hydrocinnamaldehyde with propargylamine a to form the cor-\nresponding secondary amine coupling product 21a (54%–95%\nconv.) as well as the coupling of benzaldehyde 17 with a, yielding\nnorpargyline 26a (up to >99% conv.). However, PTR1s only\nshowed low conversion (up to 6%) when tasked with the amina-\ntion 4-phenyl-2-butanone 22 with propargylamine a or allylamine\ne. Similarly, NRs catalyzed the amination benzaldehyde 26 with a\nto afford the corresponding amine 26a in high conversion (up\n>99%) but displayed weak amination for hydrocinnamaldehyde\n21 and only trace activity for the amination of 22. In contrast, the\nclassical IREDs/RedAms performed well across these sub-\nstrates, affording high conversion of up to >99%. For the reduc-\ntive amination of ketone 22 with amines a or e, the (R)-conﬁgured\namine products ((R)-22a, and (R)-22e) were generated with mod-\nerate to high enantioselectivity of up to 95% e.e. Although this\npreliminary screen shows that PTR1s and NRs are suitable for\nthe amination of aromatic aldehydes and simple cyclic ketones\nand less efﬁcient for the amination of (aromatic) ketones, an\nextensive substrate proﬁling study is needed to map out the\ndistinctive substrate speciﬁcities of PTR1s and NRs, as well as\nthe other enzyme families described in this work.\nThe classical IREDs emerged as the most versatile of these\nenzyme families for synthetic application in the reductive amina-\ntion of ketones. Hence, we further investigated the efﬁciency of\nthe novel IREDs/RedAms identiﬁed in this work ( Table S1 ) to-\nward the amination of difﬁcult-to-aminate bicyclic aromatic\nketones such as 1-indanone 27 and 1-tetralone 28. The syn-\nthesis of a-secondary amines from bicyclic aromatic ketones\nrepresents one of the most challenging reactions for existing\n8 Chem Catalysis 4, 101160, December 19, 2024\nArticle\nll\nOPEN ACCESS\nIREDs/RedAms.52 Achieving this transformation remains hugely\nattractive, as corresponding amine products formed from this re-\naction are prevalent in pharmaceutical drugs. To this end, we\nscreened 9 members of clade 1 (classical IREDs) for the amina-\ntion of 27 with methylamine c, revealing BacRedAm, MaRedAm,\nand AserRedAm as the best-performing members of this clade\nfor these substrates.\nThe amination of 1-indanone with methylamine c formed the\ncorresponding a-secondary amine product 27c with modest\nconversion values (54%–60%).

Cells with en dashes mean that activity was not detected under the screening conditions. The following screening conditions were used: reaction s\ncontain 5–10 mM ketones, 60 mM amine nucleophile (100 mM for ammonia) added to reaction mixture from 1 M pH adjusted stock solution (pH 9), and\n0.5 mM NADPH. The reaction was performed in Tris-HCl buffer (100 mM, pH 9, supplemented with 7.5 mM MgCl 2), and 0.05–0.6 mg mL /C01 IRED was\nadded to start the reaction. The initial reaction rate was monitored at 340 nm using a microtiter plate reader.\nChem Catalysis 4, 101160, December 19, 2024 9\nArticle\nll\nOPEN ACCESS\nproduced the ( R)-27c with e.e. values of 12% and 78%, respec-\ntively, while BacRedAm generated ( S)-27c (71% e.e.) ( Figure 3 ;\nsee also supplemental information and Figure S7). Interestingly,\nBacRedAm-catalyzed reductive amination of 27 with propargyl-\namine a afforded the ( R)-conﬁgured amine product rasagaline\n27a (27% conv., 79% e.e.), indicating that the amine nucleophile\ncan play a role in the stereochemical outcome of RedAm-cata-\nlyzed reductive amination. Both MaRedAm and AserRedAm\nalso afforded rasagiline ( R)-27a (MaRedAm: 32% conv., 71%\ne.e.; AserRedAm: 44% conv., 82% e.e.), retaining the selectivity\nobserved with N-methylated product 27c (Figure 3 ). The\nRedAm-catalyzed amination with other amine nucleophiles,\nnamely cyclopropylamine b and allylamine e, yielded the corre-\nsponding amine products 27a and 27e in moderate conversions\nof up to 65%. These enzymes also catalyzed the reductive\namination of 1-tetralone 28 with methylamine to yield 28c,a\nkey intermediate of sertraline, albeit in low conversion values\nFigure 3. Investigation of the performance\nof PTR1s, NRs, and classical IREDs for the\nreductive amination of aromatic ketones\nand aldehydes\nPteridine reductases (PTR1s) and norcraugsodine\nreductases (NRs) were able to catalyze the ami-\nnation of aromatic aldehydes but showed only\nweak/trace activity toward the amination of aro-\nmatic ketones. Novel reductive aminases identi-\nﬁed from this work catalyzed the stereoselective\nreductive amination of aromatic ketones for the\nsynthesis of a-chiral secondary amines. A glucose\ndehydrogenase (GDH)-based cofactor recycling\nsystem was employed, with glucose used as a\nsacriﬁcial oxidant.

While accidental enzyme discovery in biosynthetic path-\nways has been the source of many useful catalysts in the past,\nhere we provide a rationale for IRED mining with high hit rates\n(average: /C2446%; successful in 4 of 6 clades) via the substrate\npromiscuity of C=N reducing enzymes. Speciﬁcally, we have\nmapped and annotated hitherto unexplored sequence space\nby uncovering distinct, unrelated enzyme families for prospec-\nting biocatalysts for enantioselective imine reduction and reduc-\ntive amination. Clade 3, which comprised PTR1s and alkaloid-\nforming plants and bacterial SDRs, represents a unique and\npromising functional annotation of sequence space to ﬁnd novel\nenzymes for enantioselective imine reduction and reductive ami-\nnation with a hit rate >87% for imine-reducing activity for this\nclade. We showed that members of PTR1s and NRs were able\nto catalyze the reductive amination of simple cyclic ketones\nand aromatic aldehydes.\n10 Chem Catalysis 4, 101160, December 19, 2024\nArticle\nll\nOPEN ACCESS\nClade 6 is another promising group to retrieve novel IRED-like\nbiocatalysts; members of this group such as the mammalian ke-\ntimine reductase mu-crystallin (CRYM) and iminosuccinate re-\nductases (e.g., PbBhCD) exhibit promiscuous (albeit weak)\nimine-reducing activity toward non-native cyclic imines, e.g.,\nisoquinoline imine. Importantly, clade 6 also features NatAm-\nDHs, which have been shown to catalyze the IRED-like reductive\namination reaction.\n7 Our approach allows the identiﬁcation of\nalternative sets of evolutionarily unrelated, non-homologous\n‘‘isofunctional’’ enzymes.\nA comparative evaluation of the performance of these non-ho-\nmologous enzyme families in the reductive amination of carbonyl\ncompounds with primary amines using a small panel of carbonyl\ncompounds including ketones, aldehydes, a-keto esters, and\na-keto acids highlights differences in substrate speciﬁcity. Clas-\nsical IREDs emerged as the most versatile enzyme class, dis-\nplaying activity across all the investigated substrate groups\nand enabling the synthesis of a-secondary amines from difﬁ-\ncult-to-aminate aromatic ketones.\nSeveral of the other enzyme classes characterized in this\nwork act on native substrates that can be considered large\nand hydrophobic, providing spacious hydrophobic binding\nsites, which should warrant future evaluation of their usefulness\nin the reductive amination of bulky substrates. Even more\ndesirable is an extensive substrate proﬁling study using large\nand structurally diverse carbonyl and amine substrate panels\nto map out the unique synthetic scope of each of these diverse\nenzyme families. Catalytic efﬁciency can further be optimized\nthrough protein engineering to provide a versatile toolbox for\nbiocatalytic imine reduction and reductive amination of chal-\nlenging substrates. In this context, sequence network models\n53\nand convolutional neural networks using deep learning\nmodels54 can serve as useful tools to investigate the sequence\nand structural features peculiar and common to these divergent\nenzyme families. Such studies may provide useful mechanistic\ninsights into enzyme promiscuity to allow (semi)-rational\nenzyme engineering of these enzymes.\nEXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES\nMaterials and methods\nFor more details on the experimental procedures, including materials and\nchemicals, procedures for the synthesis of chemical standards, procedures\nfor cloning, enzyme expression and puriﬁcation, and biotransformation reac-\ntions, see the supplemental information .\nRESOURCE AVAILABILITY\nLead contact\nRequests for further information and resources should be directed to and will\nbe fulﬁlled by the lead contact, Godwin Aleku ( godwin.aleku@kcl.ac.uk).\nMaterials availability\nAll materials generated in this study are available from the lead contact without\nrestriction.\nData and code availability\nThis study did not generate any datasets.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nThis work received support from the Leverhulme Trust through a Leverhulme\nEarly Career Fellowship to G.A.A.

Hutton, Fei Zhao, Elizabeth Ho, Jack Domenech, Vanessa Harawa,\nMurray J. B. Brown, Gideon Grogan,* Phillip D. Clayman,* Nicholas J. Turner,*\nand Anthony P. Green*\nAbstract: Enantioselective reduction of hydrazones provides a convergent and versatile route to synthesize hydrazine-\ncontaining motifs that are commonly found in pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. However, current methods require the\nuse of precious metals, costly chiral ligands, and/or forcing reaction conditions. Here, we report the development of a\nbiocatalytic approach for enantioselective hydrazone reduction using engineered imine reductases. Following evaluation\nof an in-house panel of>400 IRED sequences, we identiﬁed a single IR361 I127F L179V variant that promotes reduction\nof Cbz-protected hydrazones. The introduction of additional two mutations via directed evolution afforded HRED1.1\nthat is 20-fold more active than the parent template and promotes reduction of a variety of protected hydrazones in high\nyields and selectivities (>99% e.e.), including in preparative scale biotransformations. Structural analysis of HRED1.1\nprovides insights into the origins of its unique hydrazone reductase activity. This study offers a powerful biocatalytic route\nto synthesize valuable chiral hydrazine products and further expands the impressive range of transformations accessible\nwith engineered imine reductases.\nChiral hydrazines are key structural motifs that are found in\nmany natural products, agrochemicals, and clinically relevant\npharmaceuticals (Scheme1a).[1–5] These N─N bond contain-\ning compounds can be synthesized from chiral precursors\nusing a variety of methods (Scheme1b), including alkylation\nof hydrazines, N─N bond formation using chloramines, and\nrearrangement of halogenated ureas.[6–11] Recently, asymmet-\n[*] A.E.Hutton,F.Zhao,N.J.Turner,A.P.Green\nManchesterInstituteofBiotechnologyandDepartmentof\nChemistry,UniversityofManchester,131PrincessStreet,\nManchesterM17DN,UK\nE-mail:Nicholas.turner@manchester.ac.uk\nAnthony.green@manchester.ac.uk\nA.E.Hutton\nDisynBiotecLtd.,33MatlockClose,GreatSankey,Warrington,\nEnglandWA53PZ,UK\nE.Ho,J.Domenech,G.Grogan\nDepartmentofChemistry,UniversityofYork,Heslington,YorkYO10\n5DD,UK\nE-mail:Gideon.grogan@york.ac.uk\nV.Harawa,M.J.B.Brown\nGSK,MedicineDevelopment&Supply,GSK,GSKMedicines\nResearchCentre,StevenageSG12NY,UK\nP.

Furthermore,\nthese transformations typically require forcing reaction con-\nditions, including elevated temperatures and high pressures of\nhydrogen, which hinders their broader application.\nIncreasingly, biocatalysis is viewed as an attractive alter-\nnative to more traditional synthetic methods due to the high\ncatalytic efﬁciencies and exacting speciﬁcities associated with\nenzymes. Furthermore, the development of powerful enzyme\nengineering techniques such as directed evolution allows\nthe properties of biocatalysts to be adapted to meet target\napplications, including adaption of substrate preferences,\nimprovements in kinetic parameters, and enhanced stability\nunder process conditions.[22–24] Imine reductases (IREDs) are\none such enzyme class that have become widely adopted as\nbiocatalysts for the preparation of chiral amines.[25–31] These\nnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent\nenzymes catalyze enantioselective reductions of prochiral\nimines to a diverse array of amine products, making them\nattractive targets for industrial biocatalysis. For example,\nengineered IREDs have been developed for the synthesis\nof the chiral LSD1 inhibitor GSK2879552[32] and for the\nmanufacture of the JAK1 inhibitor acrocitinib.[33]\nAlthough hydrazones have been generated using an\nartiﬁcially designed enzyme[34] and have been shown to\nbe substrates for transaminases, [35] reports of enzymatic\nhydrazone reduction are scarce. To our knowledge there\nare only two reported cases involving (i) the selective\ncoupling of 3-cyclopentyl-3-oxopropanenitrile with hydrazine\nhydrate,[36] and (ii) a preliminary study using the IRED from\nMyxococcus stipitatus, although no data on conversion or\nAngew.

[37] Given the signiﬁcant\nsafety concerns associated with the use of hydrazine hydrate\nas a reagent for large scale synthesis,[38] together with a\nneed to identify enzymes capable of reducing C═N bonds\nin a broader range of functional groups, there remains\nconsiderable interest in developing more broadly applicable\nbiocatalytic hydrazone reduction methodologies for applica-\ntions in asymmetric synthesis. In addition to improved safety,\nthe protected hydrazine products are commonly desired as\nthey facilitate downstream synthetic manipulations. Here,\nwe report the discovery and engineering of a hydrazone\nreductase (HRED) biocatalyst that furnishes a variety of\nchiral hydrazine products with high levels of stereocontrol.\nWe selected biocatalytic reduction of hydrazone 1,\nderived from condensation of commercial (benzyloxycar-\nbonyl)hydrazine (Cbz-hydrazine) and acetophenone, as an\ninitial synthetic target (Figure 1a). To identify a suitable\nstarting template for enzyme engineering, an in-house panel\nof >400 IREDs was evaluated for activity toward the target\ntransformation. Biotransformations were performed using\ncell-free extracts along with an established NADPH cofactor\nrecycling system using glucose dehydrogenase (GDH). Of the\nenzymes tested, only one IRED sequence was identiﬁed with\nobservable activity toward the conversion of1 to 1a, namely,\nI127F L179V double mutant of IR361 (henceforth named\nHRED1.0) that was recently engineered by our lab for reduc-\ntive amination processes involving cyclic secondary amines as\nsubstrates.[39] Notably, neither the wild-type IRED361 nor the\nvariants with a single mutation, I127F or L179V, displayed any\nobservable activity under these assay conditions.\nTo enhance hydrazone reduction activity, HRED1.0 was\nsubjected to a single round of evolutionary optimization.\nWe targeted 22 positions within the active site, including\nthose in close proximity to the NADPH cofactor and in the\nputative substrate-binding pocket, which were individually\nrandomized using NNK degenerate codons. Individual library\nvariants were arrayed in 96-well plates and evaluated as\nclariﬁed cell lysate using a UPLC assay monitoring the\nconversion of 1 to 1a. Analysis of >2000 variants led to\nthe identiﬁcation of four point mutations (M125F, M125W,\nH250L, A100T) displaying increased activity. Substitution of\nMet125 to either Phe or Trp gave substantial 6-fold and\n5-fold increases in reaction conversion, respectively, under\nassay conditions used for evolution (Figure1c and TableS1),\nwith more modest ca. 1.5-fold improvements observed with\nthe H250L and A100T mutations (FigureS1 and TableS1).\nThese beneﬁcial mutations were subsequently combined by\nDNA shufﬂing, leading to the identiﬁcation of a M125W\nH250L double mutant (HRED1.1) that displays a signiﬁcant\n20-fold improvement in reaction conversion, and a 19-fold\nimprovement in reaction rate, over the parent HRED1.0\ntemplate (Figures1b,c and S2;T a b l eS1).\nUsing HRED1.1 as a biocatalyst, complete conversion of\n1 (5 mM) to1a can be achieved within 18 h (Figure2 and\nTable S1). For comparison, under identical assay conditions,\nonly 5% conversion is observed with HRED1.0. Further-\nmore, HRED1.1 displays exceptional levels of stereocontrol,\naffording (R)-enantiomer of 1a in >99% e.e.( F i g u r e1d).\nThe synthetic utility of HRED1.1 was demonstrated in a\npreparative scale biotransformation to yield 123 mg of (R)-1a\n(98% conversion, 92% isolated yield) (TableS1). Optimiza-\ntion of reaction conditions (FiguresS3–S9) afforded a 10-fold\nreduction in NADP+ and GDH-901 concentrations compared\nto those used during evolution without signiﬁcant reduction\nin conversion. The high yields achieved by HRED1.1 are\nparticularly notable given that the biotransformations are\nheterogeneous due to the low solubility of both hydrazone\n1 and hydrazine 1a. Beyond reduction of preformed hydra-\nzones, HRED1.1 can also achieve reductive coupling of\nacetophenone and Cbz-hydrazine with modest conversions\nand exceptional stereocontrol (Figure2).\nTo further explore its synthetic utility, HRED1.1 was\nevaluated for activity toward a range of protected hydrazones\n1–11 (Figure 2 and Table S2).

Analogues 5 and 6\ncontaining pharmaceutically relevant pyridyl motifs are also\nsubstrates for HRED1.1.[42,43] Substrates containing larger\naryl-substituents are not accommodated by HRED1.1 due to\nsteric constraints within the active site pocket (FigureS10).\nNotably, the scope of HRED1.1 is not limited to aromatic\nhydrazones; substrates 7 and 8, derived from the aliphatic\nketones pentanone andtert-butyl methyl ketone, respectively,\nwere efﬁciently converted in high yields. Finally, we explored\nthe activity of HRED1.1 with a selection of substrates derived\nfrom commercial hydrazine reagents featuring orthogonal\nbenzoyl (9–10)a n dB o c(11) protecting groups. Importantly,\nthese modiﬁcations are also well tolerated by HRED1.1,\nthus further expanding the synthetic utility of our hydrazone\nreductase biocatalyst.\nThe improved ability of HRED1.1 to accept the hydrazone\n1 was investigated using X-ray crystallography and modeling.\nThe structure was determined to a resolution of 2.77 Å,\nwith two molecules, A and B, in the asymmetric unit\ncomprising one dimer. The structure was very similar overall\nto that of wild-type IR361 (PDB 7OSN),[40] displaying the\ncanonical IRED fold, in which an N-terminal Rossman fold\ndomain is attached to a C-terminal helical bundle through\na long interdomain helix. Two active sites are formed at\nthe interfaces of the N-terminal domain of one monomer\nand the C-terminal bundle of the other through reciprocal\ndomain sharing. The crystals contained a large proportion of\nwater (71%) and the modest resolution was accompanied by\npoor electron density in the N-terminal domain of monomer\nB, leading to some zero-occupancy residues and many side-\nchains not being modeled in that region. However, the\ndensity within monomer A and the C-terminal bundle of\nB was good, permitting the building of side chains and\nNADP+ molecule within the active site at the interface of the\ndomains. Omit density for the more structurally consequential\nmutations (M125W and I127F) was also clear (FigureS11).\nSuperimposition of the HRED1.1 structure with that of\nwild-type IR361 revealed the consequences of the mutations\n(Figure 3a). The substitution of I for F in position 127 at\nthe bottom of the active site as presented in Figure3a has,\ncounterintuitively, made more space in the active site through\nthe displacement of the side chain of (B)Y221. Mutation of\nM125 to W at the top of the active site has again created\nmore space, despite being a larger residue as it projects\nupward and makes a new stabilizing interaction with the\nside chain of D176 through the N-atom on the indole ring.\nFurther stabilization of this conformation may be provided\nby a stacking interaction between the indole and the mutated\n179 position from L to V, which lies on the interdomain\nhelix on the other side of the active site cavity. (B)H250L\nis situated at the interface between the N-terminal domain\nof one monomer and the C-terminal bundle of its neighbor\nand may provide stabilizing hydrophobic interactions in a\nmode that has been observed for other IREDs in engineering\nstudies.[29,32,33,44]\nThe structure of HRED1.1 was modeled with the sub-\nstrate 1 (Figure 3b) using Autodock VINA.[45] One of the\nlowest energy conformations positioned the ligand with the\nAngew.

In this study, we present a \ncolorimetric immunosensor for the detection of Treponema pallidum antibodies (TP-Ab) \nusing a natural silk cocoon membrane (SCM) as the substrate, based on the principle \nof enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The TP monoclonal antibody 3H12 and \nthe chimera antigen TP99, comprising epitopes TP15, TP17 , and TP47, were sequen­\ntially coupled to functionalized SCM to form the SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor. \nThe detection was quantified by color extraction, and the Corrected Ired values were \nused as a judgment parameter. The TP-Ab immunosensor demonstrated a detection \nlimit of 0.48 mIU/mL, lower than the 0.68 mIU/mL limit of commercial microplate \nELISA kits. Furthermore, it exhibited no cross-reactivity with antibodies against other \npathogens. Testing with a reference serum panel yielded 100% concordance with the \nreference results. Comprehensive statistical analysis of the Corrected Ired values from \nthe reference serum panel and banked samples indicated an optimal cutoff value of \n0.0921, achieving 100% sensitivity, 97.96% specificity, and high overall accuracy, with \nan area under the curve of 0.9995 and a 95% confidence interval of 0.9979–1.00. \nMoreover, a statistically significant correlation with microplate ELISA was observed ( r = \n0.9217, P < 0.0001). This reliable ELISA-integrated colorimetric immunosensor, featuring \na three-dimensional porous structure and inherent bioactiv ity, contributes to improving \nthe detection performance and provides a rapid and convenient diagnostic solution for \nsyphilis. It is particularly well-suited for resource-limited settings where on-site testing is \ncritical.\nIMPORTANCE Syphilis remains a major global public health concern, particularly in \nresource-limited settings where early and accurate diagnosis is often hindered by \ntechnical and economic barriers. Here, we report a novel treponemal antibody (TP-Ab) \nimmunosensor based on natural silk cocoon membrane (SCM), a biocompatible and \nporous material with intrinsic bioactivity. By integrating enzyme-linked immunosorb­\nent assay principles and a recombinant TP15-17-47 chimera antigen, the SCM-based \nimmunosensor enables colorimetric detection of TP-Ab with high specificity and visual \nreadout. Unlike traditional methods that require complex instrumentation or expensive \nreagents, this platform offers a low-cost, portable, and easy-to-use alternative suitable \nfor on-site or point-of-care testing. The findings highlight the potential of silk-derived \nbiosensors in a promising direction for syphilis screening technologies.\nKEYWORDS silk cocoon membrane, immunosensor, colorimetric, ELISA, treponemal \nantibodies\nS\nyphilis, caused by Treponema pallidum  (TP), is a highly contagious and systemic \nsexually transmitted infection (STI).

In recent years, the global incidence of syphilis \nhas been rising steadily, prompting widespread concern as a major public health issue. \nAccording to the World Health Organization, approximately 5.6 million new cases of \nsyphilis are reported annually, with the majority occurring in low- and middle-income \ncountries ( 2, 3). Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for controlling syphilis and \nreducing its incidence, but diagnostic challenges persist due to the disease’s complex \nclinical presentation.\nWhile direct diagnostic methods, such as pathogen microscopy and molecular \nbiology techniques, can facilitate early detection of syphilis ( 2, 4), their use is constrained \nby limitations in performance, availability, and cost. Consequently, serologic testing \nremains the primary diagnostic approach ( 5, 6). Serological tests for syphilis are broadly \ncategorized into non-treponemal and treponemal antibody detection methods, both \nof which are commonly used for screening and confirmation (7, 8). Non-treponemal \ntests, such as the venereal disease research laboratory test, toluidine red unheated \nserum test (TRUST), and rapid plasma reagin test, are effective for large-scale initial \nscreenings. However, these tests often lack specificity due to their reliance on non-spe­\ncific antigens, including cardiolipin, lecithin, and cholesterol ( 9, 10). Treponemal tests, \nwhich offer higher specificity and sensitivity, include the Treponema pallidum  particle \nagglutination assay (TPPA), fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorbed (FTA-ABS) test, \nwestern blot (TP-WB), chemiluminescence analysis (TP-CLIA), enzyme -linked immuno­\nsorbent assay (TP-ELISA). While TPPA, FTA-ABS, and TP-WB offer reliable results, their high \ncost, operational complexity, and limited automation impede their routine use in clinical \npractice. Automated methods, such as TP-ELISA and TP-CLIA , provide objective and \naccurate results, making them more suitable for large-scale sample screening. However, \nthese methods remain impractical for small-scale testing or emergency use, as they \nrequire longer processing time ( 11–13). Additionally, their reliance on specialized lab \nfacilities, skilled technicians, and costly reagents limits their accessibility in resource-limi­\nted settings, such as rural areas in developing countries. Given this, the development \nof alternative rapid treponemal tests suitable for point-of-care deployment could help \nlimit the spread of syphilis by enabling immediate intervention, which presents a critical \nchallenge.\nBiosensor-based diagnostic assays have emerged as promising alternatives for \ndiagnosing STIs, offering greater simplicity and faster results compared to conventional \nmethods. Several biosensor platforms have been explored for treponemal antibody \ndetection, including electrochemical sensors, surface plasmon resonance immunosen­\nsors, lateral flow biosensors employing gold nanoparticles or quantum dots, and vertical \nfiltration biosensors utilizing paper membranes ( 14–19). Despite their potential, many \nbiosensors depend on specialized substrates, limiting their practical application in \nclinical settings. Recently, silk, a natural polymer, has gained attention as a versatile \nmaterial for biomedical applications due to its excellent biocompatibility, chemical\nflexibility, and mechanical robustness ( 20–24). While regenerated silk matrices have \nbeen used for sensor applications, their preparation involves complex procedures that \nhinder large-scale production. Alternatively, natural silk fibers or membranes can be \ndirectly used as biosensor substrates, offering a simpler approach without the need for \nregeneration ( 25, 26). In our previous work, we demonstrated that natural silk cocoon \nmembrane (SCM), with its free-standing multilayered structure, porosity , and inherent \nbioactivity, serves as an effective immunosensing platform. The SCM-based platform was \nshown to enable rapid red blood cell typing in whole blood with superior analytical \nperformance and excellent thermal stability (27, 28).\nIn this study, we developed a colorimetric immunosensor using SCM as the substrate \nto detect TP-Ab targeting three highly immunogenic antigens: TP15, TP17, and TP47. \nPrevious studies have shown that recombinant TP antigens improve the performance of \ntreponemal tests, with TP-Ab against TP15, TP17 , and TP47 detectable as early as 2–4 \nweeks post-infection, earlier than non-treponemal antibodies ( 29–31). Building on these \nResearch Article Microbiology Spectrum\nSeptember 2025  Volume 13  Issue 9 10.1128/spectrum.00094-25 2\nfindings, we employed a recombinant chimera TP antigen containing epitopes from \nTP15, TP17, and TP47 as the recognition element. The antigen was immobilized onto the \nSCM-based substrate to form a TP-Ab immunosensor, integrated with ELISA principles for \ncolorimetric detection. The resulting immunosensor enables accurate, convenient, and \nvisual detection of TP-Ab without the need for sophisticated equipment or specialized \ntechniques.\nMATERIALS AND METHODS\nMaterials and samples\nSilk cocoons from Bombyx mori  were sourced from a local market. The chimera of TP \nantigens containing epitopes from TP15, TP17 , and TP47 (referred to as TP99), along \nwith horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated TP antigens (HRP-TP mix antigen), and \nthe TP47 antigen and HRP-labeled TP47 (HRP-TP47), were purchased from Fapon Biotech \n(China). The 3,3 ′,5,5′-Tetramethylbenzidine (TMB) substrate was obtained from Sigma-\nAldrich (USA). Standard reference sera—anti-HBV serum (9 mIU/mL), anti-HCV serum (48 \nmIU/mL), anti-HIV-1 serum (48 mIU/mL), along with a reference serum panel containing \n40 samples, one positive control (6 mIU/mL), one negative control (matrix liquid, 0 \nmIU/mL), and the standard TP-Ab serum at 3, 6, 12 , and 21 mIU/mL concentrations, \nwere sourced from Beijing Conchestan Biotechnology Co., Ltd., China. The detailed \ninformation about the reference serum panel and the standard TP-Ab serum is shown in \nFig. S1. Treponemal antibody ELISA kits were purchased from Beijing Wantai BioPharm, \nChina (Cat. No. WT-5296). Mouse anti-silk cocoon mAbs (MAS-2H3), goat anti-mouse IgG \n(GAM-IgG), and mouse anti-TP mAbs (3H12, specific for TP47 antigen) were developed \nand characterized in-house. A total of 58 banked serum samples , including 30 TP-posi­\ntive and 28 TP-negative samples, were examined and confirmed using the TRUST and \nTP-ELISA. These banked samples were kindly provided by the Suzhou Blood Center \nbetween January 2024 and August 2024.\nFabrication of the SCM-based TP-Ab colorimetric immunosensor\nThe functionalized SCMs (F-SCMs) were prepared as described in our previous work \n(27, 28). Briefly, silk cocoons (Fig. 1A) were punched into round discs (8 mm \nin diameter, Fig. 1B) using a hole puncher, retaining their natural interconnected \nmicroporous structure, which was characterized using scanning electron microscopy \n(SEM) (Fig. 1C). Following pretreatment, the SCMs retained their natural bioactivity\nand were sequentially coupled with MAS-2H3 and GAM-IgG to form F-SCMs through \nspecific directional immunoaffinity binding. The 3H12 mAb was then immobilized \nonto the F-SCMs by binding to GAM-IgG, followed by overnight incubation at 4°C. \nThen, the capture antigen TP99 chimera was immobilized onto the F-SCM/3H12 \ncomplexes to serve as the recognition element, completing the formation of the \nimmunosensor membrane (F-SCM/3H12/TP99) (Fig. 1D). After two PBS washes, the \nmembranes were blocked with 5% skim milk in PBS at 37°C for 2 h to prevent \nnonspecific binding. Finally, the membranes were washed with PBS and air-dried, \ncompleting the fabrication of the SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor.\nTo optimize 3H12 concentration for immobilization, gradients ranging from 0 to \n80 µg/mL (0, 0.2, 1, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 µg/mL) were incubated with F-SCMs overnight at \n4°C, using 200 µL per disc. The binding efficiency of 3H12 was evaluated via colorimetric \nreactions using HRP-conjugated TP47 antigen. Once the optimal concentration of 3H12 \nwas determined, the ideal concentration of the TP99 was further confirmed. TP99 \nconcentrations of 0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 µg/mL were incubated with F-SCMs/3H12 \ncomplexes overnight at 4°C, using 200 µL per disc. The optimal TP99 concentration was \nidentified by testing a standard anti-TP serum series (0, 3, 6, 12, and 21 mIU/mL) with \nHRP-TP mix antigen, and the strongest colorimetric signal was used to confirm the \noptimal concentration.\nResearch Article Microbiology Spectrum\nSeptember 2025  Volume 13  Issue 9 10.1128/spectrum.00094-25 3\nDetection procedure for the SCM-based TP-Ab colorimetric immunosensor\nThe SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor was employed in a vertical flow-through ELISA \nformat. The SCM discs were placed on top of 2 cm × 2 cm absorbent pads and prewetted \nwith 50 µL of PBS. Then, 50 µL of sample was added to each disc and incubated at 37°C \nfor 15 min in a water bath. Following this, 100 µL of HRP-TP mix antigen was applied \nand incubated at 37°C for another 15 min. The discs were then rinsed four times with \nPBST (PBS + 0.05% Tween-20) on the absorbent pad. Next, 100 µL of TMB substrate \nwas applied to initiate the colorimetric reaction, which proceeded for 5 min at 37°C. \nThe reaction was halted by washing the discs with distilled water. Positive results were \nindicated by a blue color on the membrane, while negative results retained the natural \nwhite color of the SCM. The colorimetric intensity was quantified using ImageJ software. \nThe detailed principle of the detection and the result processing are illustrated in Fig. 1E \nand F.\nAnalytical performance of the SCM-based TP-Ab colorimetric immunosensor\nThe linear range of detection for the SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor was evaluated by \ntesting a series of anti-TP Ab serum concentrations: 0, 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 6, 12, and \n21 mIU/mL. The concentrations from 0.125 to 2 were prepared by serial dilution of the 3 \nmIU/mL standard anti-TP Ab serum. The limit of detection (LoD) of the TP-Ab immuno­\nsensor was calculated by three times the standard deviation of the blank signal divided \nby the slope of the calibration curve at low analyte concentrations ( 32). This approach \nreflects the lowest concentration that can be reliably distinguished from background \nand is widely accepted for evaluating analytical sensitivity. For comparison, a commercial \nmicroplate-based ELISA was performed as a reference method, and its optical density in \n450 nm (OD450) values was analyzed according to the manufacturer’s instructions.\nTo evaluate the cross-reactivity of the SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor, standard \nreference sera—anti-HBV serum (9 mIU/mL), anti-HCV serum (48 mIU/mL), anti-HIV-1 \nserum (48 mIU/mL), anti-TP serum (6 mIU/mL)—and a negative control (matrix liquid, 0 \nFIG 1 Fabrication and detection procedure of the SCM-based TP-Ab colorimetric immunosensor.

This evaluation aimed to verify the specificity of the immunosensor \nand confirm the absence of cross-reactivity with antibodies of common coinfection\ndiseases.\nThe reference serum panel of 40 samples, alongside a positive and a negative control, \nwas utilized to assess the accuracy of the SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor compared to \nthe official outcomes. Meanwhile, the 58 banked samples comprising 30 positives and \n28 negatives were tested by the SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor and the commercial \nmicroplate-based ELISA. Here, two approaches were used to estimate the cutoff value for \nclassifying samples as positive or negative ( 32–34). First, the crude cutoff value used for \nclassifying positive versus negative results in the reference serum panel was determined \naccording to conventional methodology, defined as the Corrected Ired mean of the \nconfirmed 28 negative samples in the banked sample plus three times their standard \ndeviation. Then, a ROC curve analysis was performed using MedCalc software (MedCalc \nSoftware Ltd, Belgium) based on results from a total of 100 samples (40 samples and \nalongside a positive and a negative control of the reference serum panel and 58 banked \nsamples). All data were subjected to a comprehensive statistical analysis to further assess \nthe accuracy and consistency.\nImaging, color extraction, data curation, and statistical analysis\nColor changes on the SCM discs were recorded using a smartphone camera (Apple \niPhone 15, MTLJ3CH/A). Images were captured in a well-lit environment during the day \nwithout the use of external lighting or flash. The recorded images were subsequently \nprocessed for colorimetric quantification, where the surface colors of the SCM discs \nwere analyzed to extract red, green , and blue (RGB) values. Histogram analysis of the \nRGB channels was conducted using ImageJ software (NIH) ( Fig. S2 ) ( 35). To minimize \nerrors caused by variations in capture conditions or false positives resulting from darker \nimprints at the substrate edges due to liquid evaporation, a uniform selective area \nwas defined for image analysis ( 36). The approach effectively excluded dark rings and \nirregular patches, ensuring accurate pixel value representation by averaging intensity \nvalues across a uniformly distributed area. Corrected RGB intensities (Corrected IRGB) for \nred (Corrected Ired), green (Corrected Igreen), and blue (Corrected I blue) channels were \ncalculated using equation 1.\n(1)Corrected IRGB = log10\nRGB_blank\nRGB_sample .\nROC curve analysis was performed to determine the threshold cutoff values for \ndistinguishing positive from negative samples more accurately and calculate sensitivity \nand specificity by using the larger sample size. Additionally, the correlation between \nOD450 values from the microplate-based ELISA assay and Corrected Ired values from \nthe SCM-based colorimetric immunosensor was evaluated using Spearman’s correla­\ntion. Data visualization and figure preparation were carried out using GraphPad Prism \nsoftware (GraphPad 10.1.2).\nRESULTS\nSelection of the optimum color channel\nTo optimize the performance evaluation of the SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor, we \nemployed RGB image analysis to identify the most sensitive primary color channel. In \ndigital images, pixel intensity is represented by the red, green, and blue channels. To \ndetermine which channel exhibited the highest color variability for our immunosensor, \nwe independently tested and compared each primary color channel.\nAs shown in Fig. 2A and B , the Corrected Ired, Corrected Igreen, and Corrected \nIblue channels were measured across a 3H12 concentration range of 0–80 µg/mL, and \nconcentration-dependent data were plotted. Notably, the red channel demonstrated \nthe highest color variability, indicating superior signal sensitivity. Consequently, in all \nResearch Article Microbiology Spectrum\nSeptember 2025  Volume 13  Issue 9 10.1128/spectrum.00094-25 5\nsubsequent experiments, Corrected Ired was selected as the primary analytical signal, \ncalculated using equation 2. Here, Corrected Ired represents the mean pixel intensity of \nthe red channel obtained from the selected area of the SCM-based TP-Ab colorimetric \nimmunosensors.\n(2)Corrected Ired = log10\nR_blank\nR_sample .\nFabrication of the SCM-based TP-Ab colorimetric immunosensor\nBuilding upon the F-SCMs developed in our previous research ( 28), we constructed \nthe SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor based on the already prepared F-SCMs through \nfurther immunological affinity coupling. First, 3H12 antibodies were immobilized onto \nthe prepared F-SCMs, creating F-SCMs/3H12. TP99 antigen was then introduced to \nspecifically bind with 3H12, acting as the capture antigen for detecting TP-Ab.\nThe intensity of the reaction for various concentrations of immobilized 3H12 was \nassessed (0, 0.2, 1, 5, 10, 20, 40, and 80 µg/mL), and the results showed that the \nreaction intensity peaked at 20 µg/mL, with saturation occurring at concentrations \nabove 40 µg/mL ( Fig. 2B ). The optimal concentration of immobilized 3H12 was deter­\nmined when the Corrected Ired intensity reached saturation and stabilized. At concentra­\ntions below 10 µg/mL, the Corrected Ired displayed a higher value and a better linear \ncorrection with 3H12 concentration ( Fig. 2C). Therefore, 20 µg/mL was identified as the \noptimal 3H12 immobilization concentration for subsequent experiments.\nSubsequently, the TP99 chimeric antigen was coupled to F-SCMs/3H12, creating the \nSCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor (F-SCMs/3H12/TP99). Various concentrations of TP99 \n(0, 1.25, 2.5, 5, and 10 µg/mL) were tested alongside standard TP antibody concentration \n(0, 3, 6, 12, and 21 mIU/mL) to determine the optimal TP99 coupling concentration. The \nFIG 2 The RGB image analysis to identify the color channel.

However, when the TP99 concentration  was at \n5 µg/mL, the TP-Ab immunosensor displayed optimal performance, efficiently detecting \nantibodies and reaching saturation (Fig. 3A through C). As a result, 5 µg/mL was selected \nas the optimal TP99 concentration for the SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor.\nAnalytical performance of the SCM-based TP immunosensor\nA series of standard TP-Ab serum samples with concentrations of 0, 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, \n2, 3, 6, 12, and 21 mIU/mL were tested to evaluate the linear range and the limit of \ndetection. The commercially available microplate ELISA kit served as the reference for \ncomparison. The results indicated that with increasing anti-TP antibody concentrations, \nthe TP-Ab immunosensor exhibited a corresponding increase in signal intensity. Signal \nsaturation occurred at a TP-Ab concentration of 12 mIU/mL, which was consistent with \nthe microplate ELISA ( Fig. 4A, B, E, and F ). Both methods demonstrated a good linear \ndetection range between 0 and 3 mIU/mL, with R-squared ( R2) values of 0.9762 and \n0.9732, respectively ( Fig. 4C and G ). However, within the lower concentration ranges of \n0–1 mIU/mL, the TP-Ab immunosensor showed a significantly better linear relationship \n(R2 = 0.9836) compared to the microplate ELISA ( R2 = 0.9434), which is primarily due \nto the minimal variation in the OD450 signal of the microplate ELISA between 0 and \n1 mIU/mL. In contrast, the TP-Ab immunosensor exhibited more pronounced signal \nchanges, with the Corrected Ired values ranging from 0.048 to 0.231, compared to the \nOD450 range of 0.048–0.148 for the microplate ELISA. Specifically, the OD 450 for 0.1 \nand 0.25 mIU/mL were 0.043 and 0.044, which were close to 0.041 for the blank (0 \nmIU/mL), making it difficult to distinguish positive results at these low concentrations. \nComparatively, the Corrected I red signals for 0.1 and 0.25 mIU/mL were 0.083 and 0.122, \nrespectively, significantly higher than the 0.048 for the blank ( Fig. 4D and H ). This \nindicates that the TP-Ab immunosensor has a clear advantage in detecting low antibody \nconcentrations.\nBased on these findings, we further analyzed the LoD for both methods using the \ncalibration standard curve derived from the 0–3 mIU/mL anti-TP Ab concentrations. \nThe LoD for each method was calculated by three standard deviations of the blank (0 \nmIU/mL) divided by the slope of the 0–3 mIU/mL calibration curve. The calculated LoDs \nwere 0.48 mIU/mL for the SCM -based TP-Ab immunosensor and 0.68 mIU/mL for the \nmicroplate ELISA. These results demonstrate the superior sensitivity and lower detection \nlimit of the SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor, which exhibited significant signal variation \neven at low antibody concentrations.\nFIG 3 Confirmation of the optimal coupling concentration of TP99 for the preparation of F-SCMs/3H12/TP99.

The optimized SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor assay yielded \npositive results exclusively for the TP standard reference serum, with significantly higher \nCorrected Ired signals compared to other samples ( P < 0.001) as shown in Fig. 5A. Each \nsample was tested in triplicate. These results confirm the absence of cross-reactivity with \nantibodies against non-TP pathogens.\nThe detection accuracy of the SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor was further assessed \nusing a reference serum panel comprising 40 samples. Representative colorimetric \nresults for these samples are shown in Fig. 5B . Notably, this TP-Ab immunosensor \nintegrates ELISA principles for testing and result visualization, following the commonly \nused methodology for manual calculations to determine the cutoff value in ELISA assays. \nThis value is calculated as the mean value of negative samples plus three times the \nstandard deviation ( 34). The Corrected Ired signals from 28 negative samples from the \nbanked sample and the negative control were analyzed. Based on these data, the \ncrude cutoff value was determined to be 0.0944. Samples with Corrected Ired values \nexceeding 0.0944 were classified as positive, while those with values below 0.0944 were \nclassified as negative. Statistical analysis of the 40 samples indicated that 19 samples \nhad Corrected Ired values below the cutoff value, while the remaining 21 samples had \nvalues above it. The Corrected Ired values of the positive and negative controls are \n0.391 and 0.044, respectively. Simultaneously, each sample was compared in parallel \nFIG 4 The linear range of detection and LoD for TP-Ab immunosensor and ELISA-based microplate.

According to the crude cutoff value of 0.0944, sample 2, with a Corrected \nIred value of 0.096, would have been classified as positive (since 0.096 > 0.0944), making \nthe determined results of sample 2 inconsistent with the reference results. Therefore, it \nwas necessary to find a more accurate method for calculating the optimal cutoff value. \nThe determined results are shown in Table 1.\nComprehensive statistical analysis\nTo further validate the performance of the developed method, a comprehensive \nstatistical analysis was conducted using data from 100 samples, including the 58 banked \nsamples (30 positive and 28 negative), the reference serum panel comprising  40 samples \n(20 positive and 20 negative), and one positive and one negative control. Following \ncolor extraction and data curation, the Corrected Ired values for all 49 negative samples \nranged from 0.016 to 0.0961, while those for 51 positive samples ranged from 0.0949 to \n0.528 (Fig. 6A). The positive and negative controls exhibited Corrected Ired values of 0.50 \nand 0.04, respectively. The ROC analysis was performed as described in “Imaging, color \nextraction, data curation, and statistical analysis” to further assess assay performance. \nThe analysis identified two potential cutoff values, 0.0921 and 0.0961, which closely \naligned with the preliminary calculated crude cutoff value of 0.0944. These thresholds \ncorresponded to sensitivities of 100% and 98.04%, and specificities of 97.96% and 100%, \nrespectively (Table 2). Based on the Youden index, the cut off of 0.0961 (Youden index \n= 0.9804) was selected as the optimal cutoff value, which achieved 100% specificity, \nand it was superior to the cutoff value of 0.0921 (Youden index = 0.9796) with 97.96% \nspecificity. This decision reflects the clinical imperative for high specificity in screening \nassays.\nAll Corrected Ired values for negative samples, except one, fell below the 0.0921 \nthreshold, while all positive samples confirmed by TP-Ab immunosensor exhibited \nCorrected Ired values above 0.0921. This threshold successfully differentiated between \npositive and negative controls with sensitivity (98.04%) and maximum specificity (100%). \nAdditionally, the ROC curve analysis also demonstrated excellent diagnostic perform­\nance, yielding an AUC of 0.9995, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.9979–1.00 \nFIG 5 Evaluation of cross-reactivity and detection accuracy of TP-Ab immunosensor.

Finally, the SCM-based TP-Ab \ncolorimetric immunosensor was compared with a commercial microplate ELISA kit. A \nstatistically significant correlation was observed between the two methods ( r = 0.9217, P \n< 0.0001) (Fig. 6C). Using pre-defined cutoff values of 0.0961 (SCM-based immunosensor) \nand 0.274 (microplate ELISA), both methods achieved 100% agreement in qualitative \nclassification across 100 samples. These results confirm the reliability and robustness of \nthe SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor for diagnostic applications.\nDISCUSSION\nHere, we present a novel colorimetric immunosensor based on SCM-integrated ELISA \nfor the detection of TP antibodies. As a new type of biomaterial, the white-colored \ncocoons of B. mori, composed of immunogenic silk proteins, provide a natural free-stand­\ning substrate with a three-dimensional, multilayer , and porous structure, without the \nneed for any chemical regeneration of the membranes ( 37–39). This superior physical \nstructure provides a larger surface area and a greater number of available binding \nsites for the immobilization of protein molecules. The binding interactions on the \nSCMs are driven by immune affinity coupling between antigens and antibodies, which \nenhances the specificity of the coupling and facilitates sensor activation and function­\nalization. In contrast to nonspecific physical adsorption and chemical modification on \npolystyrene or other synthetic substrates, this affinity-based binding improved the \ndirectionality, stability, and sequential interaction between molecular components ( 40, \n41), thereby contributing to the enhanced performance of the TP-Ab immunosensor. As \na result, the SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor exhibits a pronounced colorimetric signal \nvariation even at low antibody concentrations, demonstrating a lower limit of detection \nwhile maintaining reliable performance at higher concentrations. These characteristics \nunderscore the superior sensitivity of the SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor for detecting \ntreponemal antibody.

TP99, a chimera antigen containing TP15, TP17, and TP47 epitopes as \nrecognition elements, was used as the capture antigen by binding with 3H12 in the \nTP-Ab immunosensor. The inclusion of these TP99 epitopes allowed broader binding to \nTP-Ab, enhancing both specificity and detection accuracy (42).\nThis TP-Ab immunosensor integrates ELISA principles for testing and result visu­\nalization, achieving a notable improvement without the need for specialized instru­\nments. Only after smartphone camera imaging, the color extraction, data curation, \nand statistical analysis provide more accurate results. By comparing the primary color \nchannels, the red channel demonstrated the highest color variability, indicating superior \nsignal sensitivity, and the Corrected Ired values were selected as the primary analytical \nsignal, calculated using equation 2 . In addition to determining the results through \ncolor extraction analysis, rapid and preliminary judgments can also be made by visually \nobserving the colorimetric signal variation with the naked eye: negative samples display \nwhite color, representing SCM’s intrinsic color, while positive reactions exhibit a strong \nblue contrast. Therefore, the SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor shows potential for use \nin various diagnostic scenarios, from standard clinical laboratories to resource-limited \nsettings, particularly for rapid small-scale or point-of-care testing.\nThe SCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor (F-SCMs/3H12/TP99) was fabricated with the \noptimal immobilization concentrations of 3H12 and TP99. This immunosensor demon­\nstrated a detection limit of 0.48 mIU/mL, significantly surpassing the 0.68 mIU/mL limit \nof commercial microplate ELISA kits, and showed no cross-reactivity with antibodies \nagainst HBV, HCV, and HIV-1. These antibodies of pathogens were selected for this initial \nspecificity study because they are included in the mandatory blood donor screening \npanel in China and have been reported to occasionally cause false-positive results in \nsyphilis serological assays, possibly due to atypical antibody responses ( 43). While this \nevaluation provides a foundational assessment of assay specificity, further studies will \nbe conducted to assess potential cross-reactivity with antibodies against phylogeneti­\ncally or antigenically related microorganisms, including Borrelia and Leptospira species, \nother gram-negative bacteria, and closely related Treponema species. This ROC-derived \noptimal cutoff value of 0.0961 was ultimately used for all subsequent classification of \nclinical samples, prioritizing 98.04% sensitivity and 100% specificity, critical for mini­\nmizing false-negative results and reducing the risk of transmission in the context of \ninfectious diseases. The immunosensor demonstrated high overall accuracy, with an AUC \nof 0.9995 ± 0.0008 and a 95% CI of 0.9979–1.00. A statistically significant correlation was \nobserved between the TP-Ab immunosensor and the microplate ELISA ( r = 0.9217, P < \n0.0001), with 100% agreement. These results confirm the reliability and robustness of the \nSCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor for diagnostic applications.\nFIG 6 Comprehensive statistical analysis of reference serum panel and banked samples. ( A) Corrected Ired values for the 100 samples. (B) ROC curve illustrating \nthe diagnostic performance of the immunosensor. (C) Comparative statistical analysis of results from both methods.\nResearch Article Microbiology Spectrum\nSeptember 2025  Volume 13  Issue 9 10.1128/spectrum.00094-25 11\nAlthough the TP-Ab immunosensor demonstrated promising diagnostic performance \nin this preliminary study, one major limitation of this study is the lack of sufficient clinical \nsample data from multiple time points or different stages of syphilis. Future large-scale \nclinical validation involving more samples is necessary to ensure statistical robustness \nand enhance the broader applicability of the product in diverse clinical settings. \nPrevious studies have shown that recombinant TP antigens can enhance treponemal test \nperformance, with IgG or IgM antibodies against TP15, TP17 , and TP47 detectable 2–4 \nweeks after infection, earlier than non-treponemal antibodies ( 12, 44). However, further \nvalidation is needed to confirm that the chimeric recombinant antigen TP99, containing \nthese epitopes, can accurately detect IgG or IgM antibodies specific to syphilis and \nthus demonstrate the broader applicability of the TP-Ab immunosensor. In addition, the \nnatural SCMs were manually screened to ensure consistency in small-scale experiments ;\ntheir inherent variability remains a challenge for reproducibility and scalability. Future \nefforts will focus on reproducible matrix fabrication using engineered silk fiber paper, \nas reported in our previous study ( 45), which could be used for the detection of TP \nantibodies.\nConclusions\nIn summary, we have developed a novel SCM-based immunosensor for the detection \nof TP antibodies, representing the first application of an SCM-derived colorimetric \nimmunosensor integrated ELISA. The optimized protocol for detecting TP antibodies \nin human serum has been successfully demonstrated, highlighting the sensor’s potential \nfor on-site syphilis diagnosis. Despite its promising performance, further optimization of \nSCM production to enhance reproducibility and scalability and expansion to detect other \nbiomarkers are necessary for broader applicability, especially in point-of-care testing \nin low-resource settings. This work paves the way for the development of cost-effec-\ntive, SCM-based, smartphone-readable immunosensors using natural substrates. The \nSCM-based TP-Ab immunosensor holds substantial potential for early syphilis screening \nand diagnosis, particularly in resource-limited or remote areas, addressing critical gaps in \naccessible healthcare diagnostics.\nACKNOWLEDGMENTS\nWe thank the staff of the Suzhou Blood Center for providing samples.\nThis study was supported by the Science and Technology Cooperation Special Fund \nProject for High-Tech Industrialization of the Jilin Province and Chinese Academy of \nSciences (Grant No. 2023SYHZ0044), Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, \nChina (Grant No. ZR2022QH221), and Suzhou Science and Technology Plan Project (Grant \nNo. SJC2022013).\nH.M.W. conceptualized the study; H.M.W., S.H.D., and Y.Z.H. performed the investi­\ngation; H.M.W., S.H.D., and Y.Z.C. reviewed and edited the manuscript; S.H.D., Y.Q.C., \nand J.J.T. curated the data; Y.J.W. and J.J.T. performed formal analysis; Q.X. and L.H.T. \nperformed the investigation and provided resources.

As advancements in protein screening and engineering\nrapidly evolve, the demand for efficient, rapid chiral analysis\nmethods has intensified. Addressing this need, we introduce a high-\nthroughput\n19\nF NMR-based assay that provides comprehensive\ninsights into the enantioselectivity, stereopreference, and yields of\nbiocatalytic reactions. This assay has been successfully applied to\nscreen imine reductases, showcasing its efficacy in the directed\nevolution for synthesizing an intermediate of the anti-Parkinson\ndrug, rotigotine. Our method offers substantial promise for\npropelling forward the fields of biocatalysis and synthetic biology\nby accelerating the assessment of stereochemical outcomes in\nbiocatalytic processes.\n■\nINTRODUCTION\nBiocatalysis has emerged as an essential technique across\ndiverse fields, including organic synthesis and pharmaceutical\ndevelopment, valued for its mild reaction conditions, excep-\ntional selectivity�encompassing enantio-, chemo-, and\nregioselectivity�and its environmental advantages.\n1−6\nThis\napproach is particularly effective in asymmetric synthesis of\ncarbon−carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds. For instance,\nterpene cyclases efficiently transform unsaturated terpene\nbackbones into cyclic terpenoids with impressive stereo-\nselectivity.\n7\nDiels−Alderases facilitate the asymmetric [4 + 2]\ncyclizations that form cyclohexane rings prevalent in natural\nproducts.\n8−11\nMoreover, enzymes like cytochrome P450 and\niron-α-ketoglutarate-dependent oxygenases (Fe/αKGs) are\ngaining recognition for their ability to introduce oxygen into\nunreactive C−H bonds.\n12−17\nThe field of biocatalysis is rapidly\nadvancing with the integration of directed evolution, which is\nfurther bolstered by the use of machine learning and\nautomated processes in reaction setup and workup. Innova-\ntions in high-throughput screening technologies have dramat-\nically accelerated enzyme screening, offering rapid, efficient\nevaluations and shifting away from the traditionally slow pace\nof enzyme analysis to enhance screening capacity.\n18\nDespite\nthese advances, challenges remain in precise chiral screening,\nwhere dependence on traditional chiral high-performance\nliquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis considerably limits\nthe efficiency of the iterative “design-build-test” loop in\nasymmetric biocatalysis.\n19−25\nTo enhance the enantioanalysis of biocatalytic reactions,\nvarious strategies have been employed. A prominent approach\nis the use of isotopically labeled pseudoenantiomers or pseudo-\nmeso-compounds, as demonstrated by Reetz and colleagues.\n26\nThis method measures enantioselectivity by comparing the\nratio of nonlabeled to labeled products, which can be\nconveniently determined using techniques such as nuclear\nmagnetic resonance (NMR), and mass spectrometry (Figure\n1A).\n26,27\nAlternatively, enantioselectivity can be assessed by\ncomparing reaction rates between enantiopure and racemic\nsubstrates, with monitoring through changes in fluorescence or\nheat generation.\n28,29\nThese methods are effective for screening\nvarious kinetic resolutions and desymmetrization reactions\n(Figure 1A), although they are generally not suitable for\nreactions involving prochiral substrates. Recently, Kroutil and\ncolleagues have developed an ingenious approach for screening\nperoxygenases in C−H oxidations, utilizing the formation of\nnicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) from\nthe highly enantioselective dehydrogenase-catalyzed oxidation\nof the secondary alcohol product. This serves as a probe for the\nenantioselectivity of the C−H oxidation (Figure 1B).\n30\nReceived: March 18, 2025\nRevised: May 20, 2025\nAccepted: May 21, 2025\nPublished: June 3, 2025\nArticlehttp://pubs.acs.org/journal/acscii\n© 2025 The Authors.

{"text": "Additional sophisticated methods include the use of circular\ndichroism (CD), which leverages reversible interactions and\ncovalent derivatization of target chiral analytes to induce\nsignificant Cotton effects and characteristic CD signals.\n31−34\nDespite significant advancements, there remains a significant\nneed for rapid screening methods for amines, which are\nindispensable in the synthesis of natural products and in\npharmaceutical development. Addressing this, the develop-\nment of specialized enantioanalysis techniques for imine\nreductases and reductive aminases is crucial. In this regard,\nwe have introduced a novel\n19\nF NMR-based assay for rapid\nscreening of biocatalytic reactions producing chiral amines.\nWith NMR spectrometer equipped with a regular autosampler,\nthis method could assess enantioselectivity, stereopreference,\nand reactivity approximate 1000 samples per day (Figure 1C).\nBy employing this assay in directed evolution experiments, we\nenhanced the enantioselectivity of a reductive amination\nreaction to produce an intermediate of the anti-Parkinson\ndrug from 40% enantiomeric excess (ee) to 99%, illustrating its\npotential to refine biocatalytic methods efficiently.\n■\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nThe rapid enantioanalysis of amines from biocatalytic reactions\npresents significant challenges. One primary issue is the use of\nNADPH or its analogs in imine reduction reactions, which\nabsorb ultraviolet (UV) light strongly and can interfere with\nUV or fluorescence-based detection methods. Such interfer-\nence often leads to inaccurate correlations between the optical\nsignal and the enantiocomposition. Additionally, the use of cell\nlysates instead of purified enzymes in biosynthetic screening\nintroduces variability due to their undefined composition,\nwhich can cause further interferences. Another major hurdle is\nthe development of rapid chiral analysis methods that are\neffective for both primary and secondary amines. Secondary\namines, in particular, pose a greater challenge due to their\nincreased steric bulkiness,\n35−37\neven though they are the\ndesired products in many biocatalytic imine reduction and\nreductive amination reactions and are prevalent in natural\nproducts and critical pharmaceuticals. Moreover, the detection\nof chiral substances in biocatalytic systems is complicated by\nlow concentrations of chiral products and the presence of\nsubstrates, enzymes, and byproducts, which create a complex\nmatrix obscuring detection. This increases the difficulty of\naccurately detecting and quantifying chiral substances.\nHowever, current methods, including fluorescence and CD,\noften rely on changes in optical signal intensity and do not\nprovide discrete signals for each enantiomer, undermining\ndetection fidelity in complex samples and requiring relatively\ncontrolled conditions. To address these challenges, we propose\nthe use of a suitable\n19\nF-labeled probe in conjunction with\n19\nF\nNMR, which could provide a viable solution for rapid chiral\nscreening in biocatalytic reactions. A probe that reversibly\nbinds chiral analytes eliminates the need for covalent\nderivatization, allowing immediate detection upon mixing\nwith the target sample (Figure 1C).\n38−40\nThe distinct\nadvantages of\n19\nF NMR, including high sensitivity and low\nbackground noise, provide robust anti-interference capabilities,\nfacilitating rapid detection and quantification of minimal\nanalyte quantities.\n41−43\nEstablishment of the Enantioanalysis Platform. To\nevaluate the viability of our approach, we employed 5-methyl-\n3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrole (1) as a model substrate (Figure 2).\nUpon reduction, it yields 2-methylpyrrolidine (1a) featuring a\nchiral carbon center connected to the nitrogen atom.\nTraditional chiral detection of 2-methylpyrrolidine via\nchromatography is hindered by its weak UV absorption,\ntypically necessitating covalent derivatization followed by\nchromatographic separation. This process significantly impedes\nFigure 1. High-throughput chiral detection methods for biocatalysis. (A) Chiral analysis of biocatalytic kinetic resolution enabled by isotope\nlabeling.

Sci. 2025, 11, 1094−1102\n1095\nthe efficiency of biocatalytic reaction screenings. For the\nenantioanalysis of 2-methylpyrrolidine, we utilized a chiral\n19\nF-\nlabeled cyclopalladium probe (Figure 2A, probe-CF\n3\n)\ncharacterized by its open binding site, which is essential for\naccommodating sterically bulky analytes and enhancing the\nrecognition of complex secondary amines.\n44\nDuring detection,\nthe probe interacts with various amine products and the\nsubstrate 1, producing distinct\n19\nF NMR signals for each\nspecies (Figures 2A−C and Figures S1,3,6 in SI). The\nenantiomeric composition is accurately reflected in the\nintegrals of these signals. To address the slight variations in\nthe probe’s binding affinity toward the R and S enantiomers of\n1a, we introduced a correction coefficient to adjust for biases\nin ee determination arising from differential complexation.\nThis correction factor is readily calculated from the ratio of the\nintegrals of\n19\nF NMR signals obtained from the analysis of\nracemic samples (Figure S2 in SI).\n37\nOur investigation has\ndemonstrated that this method can precisely evaluate the\nFigure 2.

Sci. 2025, 11, 1094−1102\n1096\nenantiocomposition of the target sample, showing an excellent\nlinear correlation between the measured ee values and the\nactual enantiocomposition (Figure 2D). Notably, this\ntechnique typically exhibits a deviation of less than 2%,\n39,44\noffering significantly greater accuracy compared to other\nseparation-free enantioanalysis methods. Moreover, the capa-\nbility of directly detecting the R and S enantiomers of the\namine product enhances the fidelity of the detection process,\nfacilitating the easy identification of impurities or byproducts.\nThis feature is crucial for screening biocatalytic reactions and is\ndifficult to achieve with alternative methods. Evaluating the\nconversion of biocatalytic reactions is crucial for assessing\nenzyme performance. While various methods exist to\ndetermine the yield of biocatalytic transformations, the\nsimultaneous determination of both yield and enantioselectiv-\nity is particularly valuable, as it provides comprehensive\ninformation and prevents the oversight of crucial details that\nmight occur if either efficiency or selectivity is screened in\nisolation. Accurate yield determination using chiral dynamic\n19\nF NMR probes has long been challenging, as incomplete\nbinding between the probe and the analyte can lead to\nsignificant errors when relying on direct integration of the\n19\nF\nNMR signals. To address this limitation and facilitate the\nquantification of conversion, (R)-2-methylpiperidine (Int-I)\nwas introduced as an internal standard (Figure 2C and Figure\nS3 in SI). This compound competes with the target product\nfor the binding site of probe-CF\n3\n. By comparing the relative\nintegrals of the\n19\nF signals of the internal standard to those of\nthe product enantiomers, both conversion and enantioselec-\ntivity can be simultaneously determined (Figures 2D, 2E and\nFigures S1 to S5 in SI). This method enhances the accuracy\nand comprehensiveness of our enzyme screening process,\nallowing for a more effective evaluation of biocatalytic\nreactions.\nScreening of Imine Reductases. Having established\nmethods to determine both conversion and enantioselectivity,\nwe next applied this approach to the high-throughput\nscreening of imine reductases for the reduction of specific\nsubstrates. Initially, we employed 12 of well-characterized\nenzymes\n45−56\nas query sequences to conduct the basic local\nalignment search tool (BLAST) search against the non-\nredundant protein database hosted by the national center for\nbiotechnology information (NCBI). Based on sequence\nsimilarity, we compiled a panel of 134 imine reductases\n(IREDs) (Table S11 in SI). These IREDs were then\nsystematically tested to identify those that exhibited the\ndesired catalytic activity and enantioselectivity. Following the\nenzymatic reactions (carried out in 96-well plates), the reaction\nmixture was combined with a deuterated chloroform solution\ncontaining probe-CF\n3\nand an internal standard (Int-I). After\nthorough mixing and centrifugation, the deuterated chloroform\nphase was directly subjected to\n19\nF NMR analysis without\nfurther purification (Figure 3A). This process allows for the\nsimultaneous evaluation of both yield and enantioselectivity\nbased on the newly generated\n19\nF NMR signals (Figure 2).\nDue to the high sensitivity of this method, only 6 μmol of\nsubstrate is required for the analysis, aligning well with\nstandard biocatalytic screening setups. The platform is highly\nFigure 3. (A) Schematic workflow of the high-throughput NMR chiral screening process.

The product yield was quantified by\n19\nF NMR analysis relative to an internal standard. The\nenantiomeric excess (ee) values were determined using\n19\nF NMR.\nACS Central Science http://pubs.acs.org/journal/acscii Article\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.5c00498\nACS Cent. Sci. 2025, 11, 1094−1102\n1097\nefficient, taking less than 1.5 min to determine both conversion\nand enantioselectivity for each reaction (Table S6 in SI). With\nan NMR spectrometer equipped with a standard autosampler,\n24 samples can be analyzed in 35 min, requiring no further\noptimization of the spectroscopy or acceleration of the\nautosampling process. This setup allows for the screening of\napproximately 1,000 samples in a single day. Chromatographic\nresolution of chiral analytes typically takes 10 to 40 min per\nsample and often necessitates covalent derivatization for amine\nanalysis (Figure S20). Our approach boosts analytical\nefficiency by at least 10 to 20 times, offering substantial\npotential to advance biosynthetic techniques. During the\nscreening process, our platform swiftly identified that out of\n134 IREDs, 79 demonstrated activity in reducing the substrate\n1 to 1a, exhibiting moderate to high activity levels (Figure 3C\nand Table S1 in SI). These enzymes showed considerable\nstereoselectivity, with the majority favoring the production of\n(R)-2-methylpyrrolidine. Notably, only three enzymes�\nIRED-186, IRED-191, and IRED-192�exhibited S-stereo-\nselectivity (Figure 3B and Table S1 in SI). Among these,\nIRED-191 was particularly notable for its high S-selectivity,\nachieving an ee of 90% (S) (Table S1 in SI). To elucidate the\nmolecular basis of stereoselectivity in imine reduction, we\nconducted a multiple sequence alignment of IREDs with R-\nselectivity and those with S-selectivity obtained through\nscreening (Figure S18 in SI), and performed homology\nmodeling on IRED-191. We then compared the simulated\nstructure of IRED-191 with the known structures of R-selective\nIREDs (Figure S19 in SI).\n47,51,55\nOur analysis revealed\nsignificant divergence at the catalytic residue. Aspartic acid\n(Asp) is consistently conserved in the active sites of R-selective\nIREDs. In contrast, the equivalent position in S-selective\nenzymes is predominantly occupied by either tyrosine (Tyr) or\nasparagine (Asn). This variation suggests a pivotal role in\ncontrolling enantioselectivity. This correlation between the\nidentity of the catalytic residue and the enzyme’s stereo-\nselectivity underscores the significance of this position in\ndefining both the catalytic mechanism and the stereochemical\noutcome. We further validated these findings using chiral\nHPLC. The ee values of 2-methylpyrrolidine 1a produced by\nFigure 4. (A) Workflow of the directed evolution process.

Sci. 2025, 11, 1094−1102\n1098\nIRED-181, IRED-185, and IRED-188, determined via chiral\nHPLC (which required derivatization and a 40 min chromato-\ngraphic separation), were consistent with those measured by\nour\n19\nF NMR platform. The deviation between the two\nmethods was less than 1% (Figure S20−S24 and Table S5 in\nthe SI), demonstrating the accuracy and reliability of our\n19\nF\nNMR approach. Notably, our method is fully compatible with\nwhole-cell-based enzymatic assays, as demonstrated by experi-\nments showing that the ee values of products generated by\nIRED-191-expressing whole cells and corresponding cell\nlysates differed by less than 1% (Table S7 in SI). This\nanalytical platform is not limited to analyzing 2-methylpyrro-\nlidine 1a; it can easily be adapted for the detection of other\namines and N-heterocycles (Figures S12 − S17 and Table S4\nin SI). For instance, when screening 1-methyl-3,4-dihydroiso-\nquinoline, we identified 109 IREDs capable of facilitating its\nreductive transformation, which suggests a broader enzyme\napplicability for this substrate compared to substrate 1a. Most\nenzymes still preferred R-selectivity, but nine enzymes (IRED-\n33, IRED-42, IRED-44, IRED-45, IRED-181, IRED-182,\nIRED-186, IRED-191, and IRED-192) exhibited S-selectivity.\nRemarkably, all S-selective enzymes except IRED-186 dis-\nplayed excellent S-selectivity, with ee values exceeding 99%\n(Table S4 in SI). The findings underscore the versatility and\nefficiency of our NMR-based platform in rapidly screening a\nwide array of biocatalysts for both activity and selectivity across\ndifferent substrates, highlighting its utility in accelerating the\ndevelopment of efficient, selective biocatalysts.\nDirected Evolution of Imine Reductases. After\nestablishing our screening platform and validating its perform-\nance across various template substrates, we next sought to\ndemonstrate its broader application by conducting directed\nevolution targeting high-value compounds, including pharma-\nceutical intermediates (Figure 4A). Imine reductases are\npowerful biocatalysts for the asymmetric synthesis of optically\npure amines, and recent advances have further underscored\ntheir strong potential for industrial application.\n48,57−59\nTo\nshowcase the utility of our platform, we selected a key\nprecursor to the anti-Parkinson drug rotigotine as a model\ntarget. The ability of wild-type enzymes to produce this\nintermediate with high enantioselectivity was previously\ndemonstrated by Turner and co-workers in 2021.\n60\nGiven\nthe increasing importance of directed evolution and the\nnecessity to screen large libraries of variants efficiently, this\ncase study serves to validate the effectiveness of our\n19\nF NMR-\nbased screening platform and provides a route for accessing\nhighly selective enzymes. The chiral amine component of\nrotigotine is in the S-configuration, prompting us to screen our\nIRED panel for this specific reaction (Figure 4B). It is\nnoteworthy that propylamine, when used in excess, may\ncompete with product 2a for the binding site on probe-CF\n3\n.\nConsequently, the residual propylamine was removed under\nreduced pressure after the reaction to minimize interference. In\nour investigation, IRED-105, IRED-99, and IRED-195 all\nexhibited substantial activity; however, only IRED-195 showed\nthe desired S-selectivity. It achieved a high yield coupled with\nmoderate enantioselectivity of 40% ee (Table S2 in SI). These\nresults are consistent with those reported in previous studies.\n61\nWe then initiated directed evolution on IRED-195 by docking\nthe imine intermediate into the enzyme’s active site (Figure\n4C). Docking studies identified nine amino acids within 4 Å of\nthe substrate that potentially interact directly with it: T101,\nI129, L180, M183, Y184, W214, F240, G248, and F249. We\napplied saturation mutagenesis to these residues and\nconducted high-throughput screening using our established\nNMR platform to assess both activity and stereoselectivity.\nFrom screening 171 mutants, the variants G248T and G248Y\ndemonstrated significant improvements in enantioselectivity,\nincreasing from 40% (S) in the wild type to 90% (S), while\nmaintaining the original activity levels (Figure 4D and Table\nS3 in SI). Mutating I129 to a more rigid proline notably\nenhanced S-selectivity. In contrast, substituting it with bulkier\namino acids such as phenylalanine, tyrosine, tryptophan, or\neven smaller cysteine resulted in decreased S-selectivity (Figure\n4D). The residue G248 proved critical for enhancing S-\nselectivity, with mutations to bulkier amino acids consistently\nleading to significant improvements. The enhancement in\nselectivity by mutations at G248 was not previously reported,\nlikely because past analytical strategies did not simultaneously\nscreen for conversion and enantioselectivity. To further\nimprove the enantioselectivity of the enzyme, we conducted\nadditional rounds of screening using iterative saturation\nmutagenesis (ISM).\n62,63\nFollowing iterative optimization, the\nfinal mutant, IRED-195-R2, was able to synthesize the target\nintermediate with 99% ee (S) and 72% yield on a 2.5 mmol\nscale (Table S9 in the SI). Collectively, our approach enables\nus to elucidate the relationship between enzyme activity,\nselectivity, and individual residues with greater precision. The\nrobust enhancement in selectivity underscores the efficacy of\nour high-throughput screening platform for directed evolution.\n■\nCONCLUSIONS\nIn summary, we have developed a novel\n19\nF NMR-based high-\nthroughput platform for screening imine reductases. This\napproach outperforms traditional chiral chromatographic\nanalysis, achieving a more than 10-fold improvement in time\nefficiency for enantioanalysis. It allows for the simultaneous\ndetermination of yields and enantioselectivity, providing a\nmore comprehensive data set compared to methods that only\nmeasure conversion or enantioselectivity. Capable of screening\nover 1,000 biosynthetic reactions, this platform is well-suited\nfor use in directed evolution processes. Previous directed\nevolution workflows typically prioritize initial screening for\ncatalytic activity, with enantioselectivity assessed only in\nsubsequent stages. In contrast, by simultaneously monitoring\nboth conversion and enantioselectivity, our method not only\nidentifies variants with improved activity and selectivity but\nalso captures mutants that exhibit enhanced stereocontrol\ndespite reduced activity. This integrated approach enables a\nmore nuanced and comprehensive strategy for biocatalyst\nengineering, where even ″suboptimal″ variants provide\nvaluable mechanistic insights that can inform the rational\ndesign of enzymes balancing both activity and stereochemical\nprecision. Moreover, its application extends beyond imine\nreductases to include other enzymatic reactions, such as those\ninvolving chiral alcohols, nitriles, and sulfoxides, contingent\nupon the use of a\n19\nF-labeled probe with appropriate\nrecognition properties. The ability to generate distinct\n19\nF\nNMR signals for each enantiomer ensures excellent compat-\nibility with complex matrices. This capability paves the way for\nthe screening of more intricate biological processes and\nestablishes the platform as a robust tool for advancing enzyme\nengineering and biocatalysis research.\nACS Central Science http://pubs.acs.org/journal/acscii Article\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acscentsci.5c00498\nACS Cent.

However, for industrial viability, it\nis more cost-effective to use water asthe hydrogen source, bypassing the\nrequirement for the cofactor. Here we report a hybrid photo-biocatalyst sys-\ntem based on infrared (IR) light and responsive reductive graphene quantum\ndots (rGQDs), for performing the direct transfer of hydrogen from water to\nprochiral substrates. The photo-biocatalyst, assembled from rGQDs and cross-\nlinked aldo-keto reductase (AKR), mediates the synthesis of the pharmaceu-\ntical intermediate, (R)−1-[3,5-bis(triﬂuoromethyl)-phenyl] ethanol ((R)−3,5-\nBTPE), in 82% yield and >99.99% ee under IR illumination. Our photo-\nenzymatic systems can also be effectively used to drive the enzymatic reduc-\ntion of imines and alkenes. Since the hybrid photo-biocatalysts are insoluble,\nthey can be readily recovered and recycled. This work opens new avenues to\ncreate artiﬁcial photo-biocatalyst systems, enabling the facile coupling of\nrenewable solar energy and sustainable chemical production.\nBiocatalysis is widely applied in the pharmaceutical andﬁne chemical\nindustries in the enantioselective production of valuable chiral che-\nmicals under mild, aqueous conditions\n1–3. Prochiral ketone reductions\ncatalyzed by ketoreductases, for example, are exquisitely enantiose-\nlective and cost-effective methods for the industrial production of the\ncorresponding chiral alcohols2,4. Chiral amines have also served as a\nfocus of attention because of the prevalence of nitrogen atoms in\ndrugs, and imine reductases are used for their preparation\n5,6. Similarly,\nene reductases, typically from the old yellow enzyme (OYE) family,\nreduce conjugated C = C double bonds\n7. All of these enzymes require\nefﬁcient regeneration of NAD(P)H cofactors for their cost-effective use\nand this typically involves using a dehydrogenase in combination with\nas a c r iﬁcial cosubstrate, e.g. alcohol/alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH),\nglucose/glucose dehydrogenase (GDH) or formate/formate dehy-\ndrogenase (FDH), or a hydrogenase with atom-economic cosubstrate\nH\n2 (Fig. 1a)8–12. Indeed, enzyme-mediated cofactor regeneration is the\ncornerstone of bioreduction but often suffers from unfavorable\nkinetics13.\nThe ideal sacri ﬁcial cosubstrate is water, which can be\nused in conjunction with electricity (electrochemical)14,15, or light\n(photochemical)16, as the source of hydrogen atoms without the need\nfor a second enzyme. The use of water as a hydrogen source not only\nprovides an economical alternative but also represents a greener and\nmore sustainable option. This approach aligns with the principles of\nReceived: 2 January 2025\nAccepted: 7 July 2025\nCheck for updates\n1Key Laboratory of Organosilicon Chemistry and Materials Technology, Ministry of Education; College of Material, Chemistry and Chemical Engineering,\nHangzhou Normal University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang 311121, P.

Much effort has been expended, therefore,\nregarding the mediation of electron transfer from water to NAD(P)\n+ by\nlight-driven photocatalysts. This generally involves the use of semi-\nconductors such as Au/TiO\n2\n17 or expensive precious metal complexes\nsuch as [Cp*Rh(bpy)(H2O)]2+ (M, Cp* = pentamethylcyclopentadienyl,\nbpy = 2,2’-bipyridyl) as electron mediators in order to avoid undesir-\nable side reactions stemming from the radical nature of two non-\ncatalyzed single electron transfer (SET) steps and convert these two\nSETs (and a protonation step) into a single step\n17–31. The electro-\nchemical method suffers from the same issues, providing the enzy-\nmatic reductase system with complexity and reducing its economic\nviability\n14,32,33. In contrast, we envisaged a simpliﬁed biotransformation\nthat would bypass the traditional cofactor-dependent catalytic path-\nway altogether.\nAnother problem associated with photocatalysis is the weak\npenetration of ultraviolet or visible light in various reaction media\nbecause biological tissues, including proteins and nucleic acids,\nabsorb visible light much more strongly than chemical reaction\nmedia\n34. Moreover, although IR light is responsible for half of the\nenergy of sunlight and has considerable penetration depth in biolo-\ngical tissues, its photon energy is relatively low and usually insufﬁcient\nto directly stimulate photocatalysis\n35,36. This hurdle can be overcome\nby introducing an infrared light-responsive component35,s u c ha s\nrGQDs in which thep electrons are excited to a high-energy state (e.g.\nthe lowest unoccupied molecular orbital, LUMO) and then transition\nback to the s orbital\n37,38.\nrGQDs were recently developed as near-infrared (NIR) emissive\nnanomaterials39,40. We previously demonstrated41 that loading rGQDs\nonto TiO2 nanotubes photocatalyst enabled a greatly improved\nNADPH photo-regeneration efﬁciency in the presence of M without\nextra sacriﬁcial reductant due to abundant Ti-O-Ti bonds formed\nbetween the interfaces, which promoted multi-electron transfer\nunder NIR excitation. Indeed the new-to-nature reactivity of enzymes\nhas been greatly extended via light promotion\n42,43. Hyster et al.\ndemonstrated that cofactor or a charge-transfer complex, formed by\ncofactor and substrate in the active site, could harvest the incident\nphotons to induce electron transfer from the cofactor to\nsubstrate\n44,45. Based on a NADPH recycling system, these photo-\nenzymatic modes work well on asymmetric dehalogenation46, C-C\nbond47,48 and C-N bond formations49. In contrast, upon visible light\nirradiation, ene-reductases (ER) could initiate single electron oxida-\ntion, which has been successfully applied in hydrosulfonylation of\noleﬁns\n50,51 and lactone synthesis, without the involving of cofactor\nrecycling52.\nWe envisaged that an accessible upconversion material such\nas rGQDs, comprising abundant conjugate structures with dangling\ncarbon bonds, would form stable assemblies with enzymes\nthrough multiple forces (e.g. cation−π,a n i o n−π, hydrophobic andπ−π\ninteractions). This would allow the short-range transfer of active\nhydrogen, generated by water splitting under IR illumination on GQDs,\nto the nearby enzyme-bound substrate without the intervention of a\ncofactor (Fig.1b). In this work, in order to validate our envisaged\ncofactor-free, infrared light driven photoenzymatic catalysis, we choose\nFig. 1 | Strategies and mechanisms for reduction of unsaturated compounds.\na Strategies for the bioreduction of unsaturated compounds and the catalytic\nmechanism of AKR-catalyzed 3,5-BTPE reduction.

The aggregation makes\nthem convenient for further characterization. The hybrid material dis-\nplayed stability comparable with that of rGQDs or AKR-CLEs which was\nconﬁrmed by their Zeta potential (Fig. S9A). Corresponding XRD and FT-\nIR measurements (Fig. S9B and S10) indicated no recrystallization of\nrGQD and no new chemical bond formation. The morphology of rGQDs/\nAKR was studied by CLSM as presented in Fig.2b, SEM (Fig. S11a) and\nTEM (Fig. S11b). The rGQDs/AKR photo-biocatalyst exhibited a regular\ncoral-like structure, consistent with that of AKR-CLEs (Fig. S3a and S4).\nSubsequently, atomic force microscopy (AFM) examination revealed\nnumerous tiny particles (rGQDs) scattered on the surface of AKR-CLEs\n(Fig. 2c). This characteristic was conﬁrmed by the energy dispersive\nX-ray spectroscopy (EDS) diagram, in which a rough hybrid surface with\nnanosized carbon clusters was exhibited (Fig.2d). Compared with the\nrGQDs precursor, there isno obvious change in carbon’s chemical states\npresent in X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) results (Fig.2e). The\nresulting hybrid material retained the infrared light responsive ability. Its\noptical upconversion emissions at 525 nm, 545 nm and 661 nm are\nsimilar to rGQDs under 980 nm IR light excitation (Fig.2f)\n60,a r ec o n -\nsistent with the rGQDs being anchored on the AKR.\nThe bandgaps were analyzed before and after the self-assembly of\nrGQDs and AKR-CLEs. As shown in Fig.2g, the light absorption of the\nrGQDs and rGQDs/AKR ranged from the UV to the infrared region,\nconsistent with potentially high sunlight utilization efﬁciencies. Assis-\nted by the transformed Kubelka-Munk function versus the energy\n(Fig. S12) and the XPS VB spectra (Fig. S13), the bandgap structures of\nrGQDs and rGQDs/AKR were depicted, obviously both of them had\nsuitable photoredox potentials for water splitting in theory (Fig.2h).\nTherefore, we evaluated the photocatalytic water-splitting perfor-\nmance of rGQDs. As shown in Fig. S14, rGQDs exhibit photocatalytic\nactivity for hydrogen production from water splitting under infrared\nlight irradiation, with a H\n2 generation rate of 3.04μmol·gcat\n−1·h−1.A s\nshown in Fig.2i, the presence of hydroxyl radicals from photocatalytic\nwater splitting under illumination was successfully detected by ESR.\nMolecular simulations and catalysis for rGQDs/reductase photo-\nbiocatalyst\nThe molecular features of assembled rGQDs/AKR were characterized\nby molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with and without bound\nNADPH. Owing to the variety of conformations, rGQDs can bind to\nvarious sites on the enzyme. The two-layered rGQDs that was initially\nlocated at different positions relative to AKR-NADPH/AKR with a dis-\ntance of 30 Å (Fig. S18 and S19) eventually formed stable binding\ncomplexes of rGQDs/AKR-NADPH and rGQDs/AKR within 400 ns MD\nsimulations, as indicated by the converged RMSD (root mean squared\ndeviation) and distance proﬁles (Fig. S20–23). The converged RMSD\nproﬁles conﬁrmed the formation of stable binding complexes of\nrGQDs–AKR both with and without NADPH cofactor (Fig. S20 and S21).\nThe equilibrated binding conformations showed extensive cation−π\nand anion−π interactions between the surface residues of AKR and\nrGQD, which have been reported to have an interaction strength of\n~14–15 kcal·mol\n–1 (close to the magnitude of a hydrogen bond)61,62.\nHydrophobic and π−π interactions also contributed to the stable\nbinding. The difference in locations of rGQDs on the AKR surfaces can\nbe ascribed to varied charge distribution due to the binding of NADPH.\nNotably, structure comparison of the equilibrated rGQDs/AKR-NADPH\nand rGQDs/AKR with the corresponding crystal structures of AKR-\nNADPH (PDB: 6KIY) and AKR (PDB: 6KIK) demonstrated that binding of\nrGQDs would not cause dramatic conformational changes to the\noverall structure and catalytic pocket domain of AKR, and the surface\nbound rGQDs would hardly hinder the binding and release of NADPH\nand substrate molecules (Fig. S24 and Fig.3).\n3,5-BTAP was selected as the substrate to explore the photo-\nenzymatic properties of rGQDs/AKR in molecular docking and MD\nsimulations model. It is usually synthesized by enantioselective\nhydrogenation of 3,5-BTAP. As binding of rGQDs would not hinder the\nbinding of substrate or change the conformation of AKR catalytic\ndomain, simpliﬁed models were used without rGQDs included.\nExpectations for the rGQDs/AKR photo-biocatalyst system require that\nthe enantioselective reduction of 3,5-BTAP can be initiated by the\nactive hydrogen generated from water molecules by rGQDs through\ninfrared light irradiation (Fig.4). On the basis of stably anchored 3,5-\nBTAP in the catalytic pocket of AKR (Fig.4a–c), we anticipated that the\ndistribution of water molecules around the binding 3,5-BTAP, repre-\nsenting diverse access paths of active hydrogen to the carbon atom of\n3,5-BTAP carbonyl group approximately, would play a critical role in\nproducing the chiral 3,5-BTPE. More speciﬁcally, the position of the\nhydrogen atom of water that is located nearest to the carbon atom\n(C9) of 3,5-BTAP carbonyl group relative to the plane deﬁned by the\n3,5-BTAP atoms C6, C9, and C10 basically determines the chirality of\n3,5-BTPE (Fig.4). Hence, the improper dihedral of∠C6-C10-C9-H was\nmonitored throughout the 20 ns MD simulations, in which H means\nthe hydrogen atom belonging to the water molecule nearest to 3,5-\nB T A PC 7a t o m .T h ep o s i t i v ea n dn e g a t i v et o r s i o na n g l e sc o r r e s p o n dt o\nthe pro-(R) and pro-(S) binding forms of 3,5-BTAP, leading to the\ngeneration of (R)- and (S)-3,5-BTPE respectively. Distributions of the\nimproper dihedral along MD simulations showed a clear preference for\nthe pro-(R)b i n d i n gf o r m si nb o t hA K R–NADPH–3,5-BTAP and\nAKR–3,5-BTAP systems (Fig. S25d and Fig.4d), resulting in an excellent\nenantioselective hydrogenation result (e.e. (R) > 99%).\nMolecular docking calculations indeed found two potential\nbinding conformations of 3,5-BTAP, i.e. the carbonyl-out and the\ncarbonyl-in ones (Fig. S26). In both binding forms, 3,5-BTAP interacts\nwith the catalytic pocket residues through hydrogen bonds. However,\ndue to the electrostatic repulsive interactions between the carbonyl\ngroups of 3,5-BTAP and AKR Q169 in the carbonyl-in binding form\n(Fig. S26b), it is energetically unfavorable relative to the carbonyl-out\nbinding form. Interestingly, driven by the induced-ﬁt effect, a fast\nconformational switch (within 500 ps) from the carbonyl-out to the\ncarbonyl-in form of 3,5-BTAP was discovered in the MD simulation,\ncorresponding well with the sudden decrease of the distance between\nthe carbonyl oxygen atom of 3,5-BTAP and the hydroxyl oxygen atom\nof the AKR Y58 sidechain at the starting stage of MD simulation\n(Fig. S27a). A representative carbonyl-out form snapshot of the\nAKR–3,5-BTAP binding complex was retrieved from the MD trajectory\n(Fig. S27c). It shows that, though the aromatic ring of 3,5-BTAP tends to\nform π − π stacking interactions with the sidechains of W21 and Y198,\ntheir distances (4.56 Å) are obviously longer than a commonπ − π\nstacking interaction distance of 3.50 Å, indicating a transient unstable\ninteraction. In addition, the inner triﬂuoromethyl group of 3,5-BTAP is\nlocated near a negatively charged carboxyl group of D53 and the\nhydrophobic sidechain of I242, which is energetically unfavorable\n(Fig. S27c). These factors are the driving force of the conformational\nchange of the binding 3,5-BTAP.\nData in Fig. S27 demonstrates that the carbonyl-in binding com-\nplex equilibrated to a similar conformation to that in Fig.4aw i t h i n\n20 ns. The hydrogen bond interaction with Y58 and theπ−π stacking\nto W21 are stable, as indicated by their distance pro ﬁles\n(Fig. S27b and S28c). The value and distribution of the improper\ndihedral ∠C6-C10-C9-H across the MD simulation (Fig. S28d, e) also\nshowed a clear preference for the pro-(R) binding form of 3,5-BTAP,\nagreeing well with our experimental result and validating the results\nshown in Fig. 4. Therefore, it is feasible and convenient to apply\nrGQDs/AKR as the photocatalyst for water splitting and enantioselec-\ntive hydrogenation.\nOur molecular simulation data provided pivotal information for\nthe enantioselective process catalyzed by the rGQDs/AKR photo-\nbiocatalyst system at the atomic level. These properties were evaluated\nby performing the photoenzymatic synthesis of (R)-3,5-BTPE in the\nArticle https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-61908-6\nNature Communications|         (2025) 16:8310 4\nabsence of both NAD(P)H or NAD(P)+ and a noble metal complex\n(Fig. 5a). Figure 5b shows the yields of (R)-3,5-BTPE with different\ncatalyst systems, namely (rGQDs, AKR, rGQDs/AKR, rGQDs/AKR and\nNADP\n+, rGQDs/AKR and NADP+ and M) under 18 h infrared light irra-\ndiation, using isopropanol as cosolvent (50 mW·cm−2). It clearly shows\nthat no (R)-3,5-BTPE was observed with only AKR or rGQDs addition,\nbut once the combination of rGQDs/AKR was provided, (R)-3,5-BTPE\nwas produced in up to 82% yield with 99.99% ee, thus demonstrating\nthe success of our method. We also observed that the yields (88%, 96%)\nwere elevated when M and/or NADP\n+ were added to the rGQDs/AKR\nphoto-biocatalyst system, but these were not signiﬁcant compared to\nthose in the absence of these two coenzymes. We conclude that,\nconsidering the high costs of both NADP\n+ and M, the photocatalytic\nsynthesis of (R)-3,5-BTPE assisted by only rGQDs/AKR is an important\nstep in the right direction. We also studied the effect of the wavelength\nof the light source. As shown in Fig.5c, the yield of (R)-3,5-BTPE was 0\nunder dark conditions, showing that light illumination was the\nrequirement for this photochemical reaction. The reaction system also\nworked well under the irradiation of visible light or simulated sunlight\n(AM1.5 G), with a yield of 63% and 86%, respectively. The lower yield\nunder visible light compared with under IR light showed that our\nphoto-biocatalyst had better responsiveness to IR light. To establish\nthe optimum wavelength for illumination, the synthesis of (R)-3,5-BTPE\nwas conducted using different monochromatic light sources (365 nm,\n7 5 0n ma n d9 8 0n m ) .A ss h o w ni nF i g .5d, it is apparent that the NIR\n750 nm is the best, i.e. close to the optimum upconversion excitation\nwavelength of rGQDs (780 nm). The most suitable IR light intensity was\n50 mW·cm\n−2 (Fig. 5e). When the light intensity is elevated to 100 or\n200 mW·cm−2, the yields are all greatly decreased to 2.9% and 1.7%,\nrespectively. The lower yields are a result of reductions in photo-\nbiocatalyst activity caused by the excessive local heating through the\nphotothermal effect of the rGQDsupon strong IR irradiation. This\nexplanation is in agreement with the results of comparison experi-\nments (Fig.5f).\nTo assess the possible effect of rGQDs on enantioselectivity, an\nimine reductase AoIRED, displaying poor enantioselectivity in (1-\nmethyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin) reduction, was examined\n63.F i r s t ,d i s -\ntributions of the key improper dihedral ∠N1-C10-C7-H in the\nAoIRED–NADPH–DHIQ and AoIRED–DHIQ models were analyzed\nbased on 20 ns MD simulations, which showed dramatically decreased\nenantioselectivity in both systems.

Additionally, in the\npresence of isopropanol cosolvent, cinnamaldehyde was reduced to\nform 3-phenylpropanol (65%) through the synergistic catalysis of ene\nFig. 3 | Superimposition of the equilibrated binding conformations of\nrGQDs–AKR (AKR in cyan cartoon) and the crystal structure of AKR (PDB ID:\n6KIK.

These results strongly suggest that the enantioselectivity and\nhydrogenation activity of the photoenzymatic system are controlled\nseparately by the enzyme and photocatalyst, respectively.\nTo further illustrate the function of rGQDs in promoting solar\nlight energy conversion, we integrated TiO2 with strong UV and low\nvisible-light absorbing properties into the above photoenzymatic\nsystem. Under simulated sunlight, (S)-3-chloro-1-phenyl-1-propanol\n((S)-CPPO), a key chiral intermediate for the synthesis of the chiral\nside chain of Fluoxetine and Atomoxetine, obtained in 72.3% yield,\nwhich is 2.7 times and 2.6 times of that without TiO\n2 and rGQDs,\nrespectively (Fig. 5h and S35) 66–69. What’s more, corresponding\nelectrostatic assembled hybrid catalysts (TiO2-rGQDs/NaCBR) can be\nrecycled with excellent chemical stability, maintaining 90% of its\noriginal catalytic efﬁciency and consistent enantioselectivity (99.9%\nee) after 6-cycles (Fig.5i).\nAn isotope-tracer experiment was carried out to conﬁrm the\nhydrogen donor in the cofactor-independent photo-enzymatic\nreduction system mediated by rGQDs/AKR to synthesize (S)-1-(2-\nchlorophenyl) ethanol. The high-resolution mass spectrum (HRMS)\nanalysis of the product obtained using D\n2O reveals that it was com-\npletely labelled with two deuteriums, conﬁrming that water was the\nhydrogen resource (Fig. S36-37). In 3,5-BTAP and cinnamaldehyde\nreductions isopropanol, a more energetically favorable source of the\nhydrogen atoms than water, was used as a cosolvent. However, it is\nalso feasible to use DMF as the sole co-solvent for 1-methyl-3,4-\ndihydroisoquinoline reduction or synthesize (S)-CPPO in the absence\nof a cosolvent. Hence, we conclude that with this hybrid photo-bio-\ncatalyst, water can be used as the sole source of hydrogen.\nDiscussion\nIn conclusion, we have successfully constructed a infrared light\nresponsive hybrid rGQDs/AKR photo-reductase system that requires\nneither an expensive noble metal complex nor an expensive cofactor\nfor its activity. Moreover, the two hydrogen atoms required for the\nreduction are provided by a molecule of water. The catalyst was\nessentially enantiospeciﬁc ( > 99.99%) in the synthesis of the chiral\nalcohol, (R)-3,5-BTPE. This custom-designed hybrid system provides\nactive hydrogen atoms through photo-catalytic water decomposition\nand directly delivers them to the immobilized AKR for transfer to the\nketone substrate. The rGQDs was also successfully combined with an\nimine reductase and an ene reductase to afford 1-methyl-1,2,3,4-tet-\nrahydroisoquinoline and 3-phenylpropanol, respectively, via IR-driven\nphoto-enzymatic reduction.\nThis methodology represents a paradigm shift in the develop-\nment of enantioselective reductions of prochiral ketones by invol-\nving cofactor-independent photo-biocatalysts in combination with\nwater as the sole source of hydrogen atoms and NIR light as the\nsource of energy. We anticipate that this methodology can be used to\ndesign efﬁcient hybrid-reductase systems that are sensitive to\ninfrared light, and could also be used to study and control\nprotein activity in cells and organisms. Since our hybrid system is a\nheterogeneous immobilized biocatalyst, it can also be readily\nrecycled and/or used in continuous ﬂow operation. In short, we\nbelieve that this unprecedented example of a hybrid photo-\nbiocatalyst that requires only NIR radiation and water to\nperform sustainable, highly (enantio)selective reductions could\nrepresent the tip of an iceberg. It could form a basis for the devel-\nopment of various cofactor independent biotransformations using\nonly water and light as the source of, respectively, reducing equiva-\nlents and energy.\nFig. 4 | MD simulation of the AKR–3,5-BTAP binding complex. aEquilibrated\nbinding conformation of AKR–3,5-BTAP, (b)R M S Dp r oﬁles of the binding com-\nponents, (c)P r oﬁle of the distance between the geometric centers of W21 sidechain\nand aromatic ring of 3,5-BTAP, (d) and (e) Value and distribution of the key\nimproper dihedral∠C6-C10-C9-H across the MD simulation.

Typically, aldo-keto\nreductase aggregates were dispersed in a 5 mL rGQDs (5 mg·mL\n−1)\nsuspension with aﬁnal concentration of 5 mg·mL−1. Then the mixture\nwas shaken continuously at 10 °C for 4 h to obtain hybrid material\nrGQDs/AKR, which were collected by freeze-drying after\ncentrifugation.\nTo prepare the bio-inorganic hybrid TiO\n2-rGQDs/NaCBR, the\nassembly of TiO2 and rGQDs was ﬁrst performed by shaking the\nmixture of 200 mg of TiO 2 and 40 mL of rGQDs suspension\n(5 mg·mL−1) at 60 °C overnight. After centrifugal separation and\nwashing with 10 mL of deionized water three times, 50 mg of TiO2/\nrGQDs composite was obtained and then assembled with carbonyl\nreductase (5 mg·mL\n−1) in 5 mL PBS buffer, pH 7.0, at 10 °C for 4 h to\ngive TiO 2-rGQDs/NaCBR after collection by freeze-drying and\ncentrifugation.\nGeneral procedure for the photo-enzymatic reduction reactions\nAll photo-enzymatic catalysis was carried out in a 45 mL custom-\nmade quartz reactor (Fig. S15) at 20 °C. For (R)-3,5-BTPE synthesis,\n10 mg of rGQDs/AKR were dispersed in 5 mL of phosphate-buffered\nsaline (PBS buffer) (pH = 7.0, 100 mM), then 3,5-BTAP (32.3 mg,\n0.125 mmol) and 3μL of isopropanol cosolvent was added. After\nthat, the reactor was irradiated at AM1.5 G with an opticalﬁlter (CEL-\nHXF300) for 18 h.

After the reactions, the target product was extracted\nfrom the supernatant in the reaction solution by 3 mL of anhydrous\nn-hexane. The yield and ee values were determined by high-\nperformance liquid chromatography.\nFor 1-methyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin reduction, 10 mg of AoIRED\nand 5 mg of rGQDs were dispersed in 5 mL of PBS buffer (pH = 7.0,\n100 mM), then 1-methyl-3,4-dihydroisoquinolin (18.2 mg, 0.125 mmol)\nand 100μL of DMF were added.
