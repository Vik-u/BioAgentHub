Abstract 
Background: The biological degradation of plastics is a promising method to counter the increasing pollution of our 
planet with artificial polymers and to develop eco‑friendly recycling strategies. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a 
thermoplast industrially produced from fossil feedstocks since the 1940s, nowadays prevalently used in bottle packag‑
ing and textiles. Although established industrial processes for PET recycling exist, large amounts of PET still end up in 
the environment—a significant portion thereof in the world’s oceans. In 2016, Ideonella sakaiensis, a bacterium pos‑
sessing the ability to degrade PET and use the degradation products as a sole carbon source for growth, was isolated. 
I. sakaiensis expresses a key enzyme responsible for the breakdown of PET into monomers: PETase. This hydrolase 
might possess huge potential for the development of biological PET degradation and recycling processes as well as 
bioremediation approaches of environmental plastic waste.
Results: Using the photosynthetic microalga Phaeodactylum tricornutum as a chassis we generated a microbial cell 
factory capable of producing and secreting an engineered version of PETase into the surrounding culture medium. 
Initial degradation experiments using culture supernatant at 30 °C showed that PETase possessed activity against PET 
and the copolymer polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG) with an approximately 80‑fold higher turnover of low 
crystallinity PETG compared to bottle PET. Moreover, we show that diatom produced PETase was active against indus‑
trially shredded PET in a saltwater‑based environment even at mesophilic temperatures (21 °C). The products resulting 
from the degradation of the PET substrate were mainly terephthalic acid (TPA) and mono(2‑hydroxyethyl) terephthalic 
acid (MHET) estimated to be formed in the micromolar range under the selected reaction conditions.
Conclusion: We provide a promising and eco‑friendly solution for biological decomposition of PET waste in a 
saltwater‑based environment by using a eukaryotic microalga instead of a bacterium as a model system. Our results 
show that via synthetic biology the diatom P. tricornutum indeed could be converted into a valuable chassis for 
biological PET degradation. Overall, this proof of principle study demonstrates the potential of the diatom system for 
future biotechnological applications in biological PET degradation especially for bioremediation approaches of PET 
polluted seawater.

Background
Plastic is an extremely useful material with a wide range 
of applications and seemingly no longer indispensable 
for our daily life. However, the millions of tons of plas
-
tic waste produced each year have become a major eco -
logical issue on our planet in the last decades, mostly 
due to inadequate disposal and the high durability of 
the synthetic material [1 ]. The consequences of plas
-
tic pollution for Earth’s ecosystems are so far unfore -
seeable, but it becomes more and more evident that 
the plastic accumulating in nature is harmful for life. 
One major threat is the formation and distribution of 
microplastics, particles smaller than 5  mm, especially 
in waters such as the oceans [2 ]. Microplastic parti
-
cles can include harmful additives and, because of their 
small size and physical properties, can adsorb toxic 
compounds (e.g., heavy metals and organic pollutants) 
and enter the food chain at the level of small animals or 
even microorganisms [3 –7].
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET)—a plastic material 
intensively used for packaging of liquids (bottles)/food 
and for production of synthetic textile fibres [8]—is pro
-
duced from crude oil resources (terephthalic acid and 
ethylene glycol) with highly increasing rates predicted to 
exceed more than 70 million tons per year by 2020 (see 
[9] and references therein). As for many other plastics, 
the steadily growing demand for PET necessitates an effi
-
cient and comprehensive global manufacturing and waste 
management system with the goal of adverting damage 
from nature. Although efficient processes for industrial 
PET (synthesis and) recycling are established, a signifi
-
cant fraction of PET waste is still incinerated, landfilled 
or ends up in the environment as macro-, meso-, micro-, 
and nano-particles due to improper disposal [10–12].
Recently, a bacterium named Ideonella sakaiensis 201-
F6 has been isolated from PET waste sources in Japan that 
is capable of utilizing this plastic as sole carbon source 
[13]. I.  sakaiensis expresses a whole enzymatic pathway 
for PET biodegradation and uptake, with two enzymes, 
PET hydrolase (PETase) and mono(2-hydroxyethyl) tere
-
phthalic acid hydrolase (MHETase), having the ability to 
decompose PET into its environmentally non-hazardous 
monomers—terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol 
(EG). I. sakaiensis exhibits the highest natural PET deg
-
radation efficiency known so far and PETase as well as 
MHETase are improved by protein engineering continu
-
ously (see e.g., [9, 14–16]). The key enzyme PETase is nat-
urally secreted by I. sakaiensis, which might adhere to the 
surface of PET to initiate its biodegradation [13], showing 
the potential of PETase for biological PET degradation 
and bioremediation approaches. Besides I. sakaiensis, 
several bacterial systems, including Escherichia and 
Bacillus, have been utilized to generate synthetic PETase 
secreting cell factories with potential application in bio
-
logical PET recycling by now (see e.g., [13, 17, 18]). How-
ever, certain disadvantages, such as the dependence on 
PET substrate presence or the addition of costly carbon 
sources (at industrial scale) into the culture/bioreactor 
for growth, exist for these bacterial systems in biotech
-
nology approaches that have to be overcome. Moreover, 
I.  sakaiensis and other microorganisms used so far for 
PETase production are not well adapted to marine habi
-
tats (see, e.g., [19])—the environments in which most of 
the plastic waste accumulates. Thus, these organisms, for 
example, are not suitable for bioremediation of PET pol
-
luted saltwater.
The diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum is a marine 
photosynthetic single-celled eukaryote with a high 
potential for biotechnological applications. P. tricornu
-
tum combines the benefits of a photosynthetic organ -
ism that is easily cultivable and rapidly grows under  CO2 
consumption in a saltwater-based environment, with 
those of an established laboratory model organism for 
which a comprehensive genetic toolbox exists. That is, 
genes can be inserted into (or edited within) the genome 
of the diatom via standard methods and their products 
can be expressed with highest efficiency under induc
-
ible conditions [20–22]. The diatom P. tricornutum is 
an excellent system for expression of foreign recombi -
nant proteins such as antibodies, antigens [22–25] and 
even whole enzymatic pathways [26–28]. Cultivation 
of P. tricornutum is cost-efficient, cells can be grown to 
high densities and since photoautotrophic the organism 
does not require supplementation of expensive sugars 
or other carbohydrates as carbon source into the growth 
medium if a light source is present [22]. The diatom can 
easily be transformed with multiple constructs and as 
shown before it has the ability to efficiently secrete syn
-
thetic recombinant proteins into the medium fraction 
[24]. These features highlight the potential of P. tricornu
-
tum as a model organism for synthetic biology and bio -
technology and underline the benefits of the diatom over 
bacterial expression systems with respect to developing a 
photosynthetic PETase production factory for biological 
PET decomposition under marine conditions.
To establish P. tricornutum as a chassis for biological 
degradation of PET via synthetic biology, the microalga 
was transformed with the genetic elements necessary to 
efficiently produce and secrete PETase into the surround
-
ing saltwater medium. We show that PETase secreted 
by P. tricornutum possesses PET degradation ability for 
different PET substrates at varying (including meso
-
philic) conditions. These results highlight the potential 
of the generated microbial cell factory for the develop
-
ment of effective photosynthesis-driven bioremediation 
approaches for PET.

Results
Expression and secretion of PETase in the algal system
The gene sequence encoding I.   sakaiensis PETase 
(improved/engineered version:  PETaseR280A [14]) was 
adapted to the codon usage of P.   tricornutum and 
expressed as fusion with gfp in the diatom to test whether 
the product  (PETaseR280A-GFP) is correctly and efficiently 
synthesized. Although the  PETaseR280A-GFP construct 
was expressed with the endogenous bacterial signal 
peptide (SP), GFP fluorescence was detected via confo -
cal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) in the ER and 
most likely other compartments of the secretory path
-
way (Fig.  1). In addition, secretion of  PETaseR280A-GFP 
into the medium was investigated. For this approach, 
three different  PETaseR280A-GFP expressing clones were 
analyzed for the presence of the enzyme in the culture 
medium via concentration of the proteins in the medium 
fraction, using SDS-PAGE and Western Blot (see “Meth
-
ods”). To this end, a total volume of 50 ml supernatant/
medium fraction of a diatom culture was used. Besides 
the concentrated proteins in the medium fraction, a 
total protein extract was obtained from the cell pellet to 
analyze both fractions for the presence of the expressed 
 PETase
R280A-GFP fusion protein. As shown in Additional 
file 1: Figure S1, at least one of the three clones express -
ing the  PETaseR280A-GFP fusion construct (clone 24) was 
able to secrete the recombinant protein detected in both 
the medium and cell pellet fraction, whereas no signal 
could be detected in the control (wild type). Interest
-
ingly, when compared to the protein standard the sig -
nal for  PETaseR280A-GFP (clone 24) appeared at more 
than 70  kDa while the calculated molecular mass was 
57.7  kDa, which indicated post-translational modifica
-
tion of the recombinant protein in P. tricornutum (see 
below). For the two remaining clones, the GFP fusion 
protein could be detected in the pellet fraction only, indi
-
cating that the  PETaseR280A-GFP protein is expressed, but 
cannot be secreted by the diatom efficiently (Additional 
file 1: Figure S1).
Since both, the relatively bulky GFP moiety and the 
non-eukaryotic bacterial signal peptide of Ideonella 
PETase, might represent factors reducing an efficient 
secretion and/or enzymatic function of the PETase fusion 
protein by the diatom, we substituted the endogenous SP 
with the SP of P.  tricornutum alkaline phosphatase (AP) 
[29] and replaced the 27.5  kDa GFP by a 1  kDa FLAG-
tag (DYKDDDDK). After the modified gene was trans
-
formed into the alga, several clones grew on selection 
medium and three of them were further analyzed via 
Western Blot as described above. As depicted in Fig.  2, 
 PETase
R280A-FLAG was secreted into the medium by 
P.  tricornutum most likely by means of the signal pep -
tide of the diatom AP protein as a targeting signal. No 
FLAG-specific signal was detected in the medium frac
-
tion of the wild type control. As only weak signals for 
 PETase
R280A-FLAG were present for clone 2 and 3 in the 
Fig. 1 Expression and localization of PETase‑GFP in the diatom P . tricornutum.  PETaseR280A‑GFP (see schematic of fusion protein) was expressed 
successfully in the diatom. Confocal laser scanning microscopy showed that the recombinant protein localized in the ER and most likely other 
compartments of the secretory pathway. Secretion of the fusion protein could not be analyzed via this method. The lower part of the figure shows a 
wild type control in which no recombinant protein is expressed. Only plastid autofluorescence but no GFP signal was detectable. SP signal peptide,

cell pellet fraction, secretion of the recombinant proteins 
by the diatom clones occurred with high efficiency. To 
test if the positive signals in the medium fraction were 
actually a result of secretion and not due to lysis of algal 
cells, we performed a control experiment using an anti
-
body against alpha-tubulin, a component of the cytoskel -
eton of the eukaryotic cell, which has been established as 
a suitable control protein for secretion analyses of recom
-
binant proteins before [24]. Signals for alpha-tubulin 
could be observed exclusively in the cell pellet and not 
the medium fraction, confirming that cells remained 
intact and no substantial cell lysis took place during the 
experiment (Fig. 2).
As already observed for  PETase
R280A-GFP , we again 
detected a putative mass shift for the expressed protein 
on the Western Blot. The calculated molecular mass of 
the AP_SP-PETase
R280A-FLAG is 30.4  kDa, those of the 
expected processed form (SP removed) 28.5  kDa. The 
dominant signals observed on the Western Blot were two 
bands between 40 and 50–55  kDa, which was approxi
-
mately 10–25  kDa higher than the predicted molecular 
mass (Fig.  2). To investigate the nature of the observed 
signals, the proteins of the medium fraction of a 500 ml 
culture expressing AP_SP-PETase
R280A-FLAG (clone 
2) were concentrated via 10  kDa cutoff filter units, 
precipitated with TCA and separated via SDS-PAGE fol -
lowed by a Coomassie-staining. The staining revealed 
that corresponding bands to both dominant signals 
observed in the Western Blot were present in the SDS-gel 
(Additional file 1: Figure S2). A subsequent mass spectro
-
metric (MS) analysis shed light on the nature of the two 
bands. The identity of both bands could be unambigu
-
ously assigned to AP_SP-PETase R280A-FLAG. Whereas 
analysis of the upper band (< 55  kDa, Additional file  1: 
Figure S2) resulted in detection of 7 unique peptides and 
a coverage of the protein sequence of 28%, for the lower 
band (> 40  kDa, Additional file  1: Figure S2) 8 unique 
peptides were identified via mass spectrometry covering 
33% of the protein sequence (see Additional file  2: Tables 
S1 and S2). These results indicate that the FLAG-tag pro
-
tein detected in the medium was indeed AP_SP-PETa -
seR280A-FLAG. In order to investigate if the observed 
mass shift was caused by post-translational modifications 
of the enzyme, we exemplarily tested N-linked glycosyla
-
tion of the secreted protein. To this end, the supernatant 
of a 500  ml culture of AP_SP-PETase
R280A-FLAG clone 
2 was concentrated to a volume of 250 µl and a fraction 
was treated with PNGase F before it was separated on an 
SDS-gel and analyzed via Western Blot (see “Methods ”). 
As shown in Additional file  1: Figure S3, the signals for

SDS‑gel separation of the cell pellet (10 µg of total protein) and medium fractions (total precipitated protein fraction) of 50 ml cultures (induced 
at  OD600 = 0.4) expressing AP_SP‑PETaseR280A‑FLAG. Detection of recombinant proteins was conducted using an antibody against the FLAG‑tag 
(α‑FLAG). As control for intracellular proteins, an alpha‑tubulin antibody (α‑Tubulin) was used. Wild type medium and cell pellet fractions as well 
as a FLAG positive control lysate (Rockland, FLAG+) served as control protein fractions. AP_SP‑PETaseR280A‑FLAG clone 2 showed the highest 
expression and secretion efficiency (middle), whereas complete secretion of the recombinant protein was only achieved by clone 1 (left). As shown 
by the control via alpha‑tubulin detection (right), presence of  PETaseR280A‑FLAG in the medium fraction was not due to cell lysis. A signal in the 
range of the calculated molecular mass of AP_SP‑PETaseR280A‑FLAG (30.4 kDa) could only be observed for clone 2 (left and middle). The dominant 
signals detected by the FLAG‑tag antibody appeared at molecular masses of approximately 40 and 50–55 kDa in AP_SP‑PETaseR280A‑FLAG clone 1, 
2 and 3. Calculated molecular masses: AP_SP‑PETaseR280A‑FLAG: 30.4 kDa; FLAG‑tag, 1 kDa;  PETaseR280A‑FLAG: 28.5 kDa; FLAG+, 60 kDa. AP alkaline

AP_SP-PETaseR280A-FLAG treated with PNGase F cor -
responded to a significantly lesser molecular mass than 
the untreated sample (negative control). This indicates 
that the recombinant protein AP_SP-PETase
R280A-FLAG 
is (N-linked) glycosylated when expressed in the diatom.
PET degradation experiments using diatom produced 
and secreted PETase
Having shown that the diatom efficiently secretes AP_SP-
PETaseR280A-FLAG into the culture medium (for analysis 
of production and secretion efficiency by clone 2 within 
a time frame of 7  days see Additional file  1: Figure S4), 
we next investigated whether the secreted enzymes are 
able to degrade PET. To this end, we chose two different 
experimental approaches. In the first one, cells from AP_
SP-PETase
R280A-FLAG clone 1 were grown in contact to 
PET film fragments sticking upright in an f/2 (saltwater) 
agar plate, which was overflowed with 2 ml liquid f/2. The 
cells were cultivated under inducing conditions (medium 
supplemented with nitrate) for 2 to 6 weeks. A P. tricor
-
nutum wild type culture grown under similar conditions 
served as a negative control. PET film was removed from 
the culture plate, sputtered with gold and analyzed via 
scanning electron microscopy (SEM), to monitor PET 
degradation by  PETase
R280A-FLAG (see “Methods ”). 
Whereas untreated PET film and fragments incubated 
with wild type cells showed, besides a typical smooth 
surface, stress marks characteristic of commercially used 
water bottles (occasional scratches and surface disrup
-
tions), the PET film incubated with AP_SP-PETase R280A-
FLAG expressing clone 1 showed a completely different 
structure (Fig.  3). In these samples, certain areas of the 
PET film, which were in contact with P. tricornutum cells 
on the agar plate, showed holes, dents, furrows and cavi
-
ties clearly visible under the SEM. The small holes were 
reminiscent to structures observed in earlier PET degra
-
dation experiments using PETase [13, 15] (see also Addi -
tional file 1: Figure S5). The furrows sometimes appeared 
in a canyon-like shape as if the missing plastic was 
washed out by a running liquid in a branched manner. In 
one particular case, we could observe a diatom cell mark 
in the form of the fusiform morphotype of P.   tricornu
-
tum from which several holes and furrows had their ori -
gin (Additional file  1: Figure S6), which overall supports 
functional secretion and enzymatic activity of AP_SP-
PETase
R280A-FLAG synthesized by the diatom.
In a second approach, we used liquid cultures of P. 
tricornutum wild type and clones expressing AP_SP-
PETase
R280A-FLAG (clone 1 and 2) grown in volumes of 
50, 150 or 500  ml. For a proof of principle experiment, 
1 ml of the medium fraction of an induced (4 days) 50 ml 
culture expressing AP_SP-PETase
R280A-FLAG (clone 
1) and 1  ml of a wild type control culture were further 
incubated with small polyethylene terephthalate glycol 
(PETG; a highly amorphous PET copolymer, see “Meth
-
ods”) commercial film fragments for 1  week at 30  °C. 
This temperature is near the optimum for PETase activ -
ity (~ 35  °C) as reported in the literature [13, 30]. The 
liquid fractions of the samples were analyzed (expected 
was mainly MHET and to a minor degree TPA and bis(2-
hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (BHET) as products) via 
UHPLC (see “Methods ” and below), whereas the small 
PETG film parts were investigated with the SEM for vis
-
ible alterations of their surface structure. As shown in 
Fig. 4, incubation of a small PETG film particle with 1 ml 
of the medium fraction (sterile filtered, cutoff 0.22  µm) 
for 7  days at 30  °C led to similar, although more com
-
prehensive, structures in the surface of the PETG film as 
observed after the first approach (PET bottle film deg
-
radation by AP_SP-PETase R280A-FLAG clone 1 on solid 
medium, Fig.  3). Again, we observed holes, furrows and 
branching canyon-like structures in the upper layer of the 
PETG film, clearly pointing to an efficient and this time 
area-wide degradation process of the plastic material. 
No obvious change in surface structure was observed 
for a similar PETG substrate incubated with 1 ml of the 
medium fraction of a wild type culture (Fig.  4, see also 
Additional file 1: Figure S7). UHPLC analyses of the con
-
centrated liquid fractions in which the PETG film was 
incubated revealed the presence of mainly TPA, whereas 
MHET, the product, which was expected with the high
-
est abundance, was present in comparably low quantity 
(Fig. 4). No generation of TPA and MHET was observed 
in the wild type control. Interestingly, when an identical 
experiment was performed using PET film from a bottle 
instead of commercial PETG film (above) as substrate, 
no significant TPA and MHET production was detect
-
able under the selected reaction conditions, neither in 
the sample incubated with 1 ml of the medium fraction 
of AP_SP-PETase
R280A-FLAG clone 1 nor in the wild type 
control (not shown).
A similar experiment was conducted with 1  ml of 
the medium fraction of the strongly expressing AP_
SP-PETase
R280A-FLAG clone 2 (dense 500  ml culture 
induced for 3  days; see Additional file  1: Figure S4 for 
 PETaseR280A-FLAG secretion analysis in relation to 
expression time) and bottle PET as well as commercial 
PETG film. Here the results were highly comparable to 
the observations made in the experiments with AP_SP-
PETase
R280A-FLAG clone 1 (see Additional file  1: Fig -
ures  S8, S9 and S10). Essentially, two differences were 
detected: (i) an almost equal amount of TPA and MHET 
was identified in the sample where PETG film was 
incubated with 1  ml of the medium fraction of AP_SP-
PETase
R280A-FLAG clone 2 for 7 days at 30 °C (see Addi -
tional file  1: Figure S8 and Additional file  2: Table  S3) 
Page 6 of 15Moog et al. Microb Cell Fact          (2019) 18:171 
and (ii) low, but similar amounts of TPA and MHET 
were detected in the supernatant (medium fraction) of 
AP_SP-PETase
R280A-FLAG clone 2 incubated with PET 
bottle film (see Additional file  1: Figure S9 and Addi -
tional file  2: Table  S3). The latter result was supported 
by structural differences (presence of holes) in the PET 
bottle film when inspected via SEM (Additional file  1: 
Figure S9). A rough estimation of the formed total prod
-
ucts (MHET + TPA) of both approaches (26.32 µm from 
PETG vs. 0.31  µM from bottle PET) indicated that the 
turnover of PETG by  PETase
R280A-FLAG is approximately 
80-fold higher when compared to bottle PET (Additional 
file 2: Table S3) under the selected reaction conditions.
In a further approach 50 and/or 150 ml cultures were 
incubated with 5 × 1.5 cm PET and PETG pieces from a 
bottle or commercial film or shredded PET particles for 
up to 14 days with and without agitation at 21 or 26 °C 
(see “Methods”). Samples were collected at different time 
points and the content of the samples was analyzed for 
the presence of PETase reaction products. The results 
of these approaches revealed that degradation of PET/
PETG film substrate by PETase-FLAG was very low or 
even absent under most of the selected conditions (not 
shown). However, when we used shredded PET—a mix
-
ture of micro- and macro-plastics up to approximately 
1 cm in size (see Additional file  1: Figure S11)—positive 
results were obtained. In this approach we performed a 
time series experiment with an around 1 week old 50 ml 
culture of AP_SP-PETase
R280A-FLAG producing clone 
2 and a 50  ml wild type control culture, which were 
incubated with an industrially shredded PET substrate 
(approx. 5  g), respectively. 1  ml samples for UHPLC 
analysis were taken after 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 10, and 14  days 
 (T
0–T14) and filtered (cutoff 0.22  µm). At time points 
 T3,  T6, and  T10, the cultures were supplied with new 
nitrate to steadily induce expression of the recombinant

upper left part, untreated PET and PET incubated with wild type cells on an f/2 agar plate overflowed with 2 ml f/2 liquid medium showed, besides 
a usually smooth surface, occasional stress marks. In contrast, PET incubated for 5 weeks with cells expressing AP_SP‑PETaseR280A‑FLAG (clone 1), 
was lanced by holes, dents, furrows and cavities when inspected via SEM (see also Additional file 1: Figure S5). In a specific area of the PET disk a 
structure (imprint) similar to the form of a P. tricornutum cell (fusiform morphotype) from which several holes and furrows originated was detected 
(see also Additional file 1: Figure S6). AP alkaline phosphatase, SP signal peptide, WT wild type, AP_1 AP_SP‑PETase

protein AP_SP-PETaseR280A-FLAG by clone 2. Interest -
ingly, we observed a progressive increase of TPA and 
MHET with a higher amount of MHET generated until 
 T
3. After  T6 the amount of produced MHET progres -
sively decreased while TPA still significantly increased 
(Fig.  5, Additional file  2: Table  S3). The level of MHET 
decreased to a minimum at  T
10, which did not perceiv -
ably change until  T14, although the total concentration of 
products (TPA + MHET) increased almost linearly until 
 T14 (Additional file  2: Table  S3). No production of TPA 
or MHET was detected in the wild type control (Fig.  5). 
The identity of the formed products was confirmed by 
mass spectrometry; estimated product quantifications 
in the micromolar range are shown in Additional file  2: 
Table S3.
A similar approach was taken for AP_SP-PETase
R280A-
FLAG producing clone 1 and shredded PET (approx. 10 g) 
in 150 ml culture volume. 1 ml samples for UHPLC analy
-
sis were collected after 0, 3, 6, 10, and 14 days  (T0–T14). 
At the same time, the cultures were supplied with nitrate 
(see above). As shown in Additional file  1: Figure S11, we 
obtained very similar results to those shown in Fig.  5. At 
 T
3 MHET was more abundant than TPA, whereas at  T6 
the situation reversed, the TPA level increased progres -
sively until  T14 and MHET basically completely vanished 
at  T10 (Additional file  1: Figure S11). The results of these 
UHPLC experiments clearly show that TPA and MHET 
(identity also confirmed by mass spectrometry) were effi

with 1 ml of supernatant (medium fraction) of a 50 ml culture expressing AP_SP‑PETaseR280A‑FLAG (clone 1, induced for 4 days) and wild type and 
analyzed via SEM. As shown in the upper part, similar but more area‑wide changes in the surface of the PETG film as observed in the solid approach 
(PET bottle film degradation by AP_SP‑PETaseR280A‑FLAG clone 1 on solid medium, Fig. 3) were detected. The wild type control (lower left) did not 
show any significant aberrations in the surface structure of the PETG film. UHPLC analysis (lower right) of the medium fractions after 1 week of 
incubation with the PETG film at 30 °C revealed production of TPA and MHET in sample AP_1 (AP_SP‑PETaseR280A‑FLAG clone 1), which were absent 
from the wild type control. PETG polyethylene terephthalate glycol, SN supernatant, AP alkaline phosphatase, SP signal peptide, WT wild type, AP1/

did not produce any PET degradation products in con -
trol experiments. BHET, which besides MHET is another 
potential product of the PETase reaction [13], was not

Discussion
If correctly disposed plastic is not waste but instead a 
valuable resource that can be part of a closed (circular) 
recycling process. The recycling of used plastic materials 
such as PET is often expensive and can involve harmful 
chemicals and a high demand of temperature, energy and 
time [31]. Thus, an eco-friendly biological degradation of 
synthetic PET polymers into reusable monomers (TPA 
and EG) via bioremediation is desired. Bioremediation 
is also one of the most promising solutions to counter
-
act plastic pollution on Earth. Micro- and nano-plastics, 
once present in the environment, because of their small 
sizes are very difficult to remove from nature. Especially 
waterbodies are highly polluted with plastic waste, and 
Earth’s oceans are accumulating more plastics year in and

in 50 ml f/2‑medium containing AP_SP‑PETaseR280A‑FLAG expressing clone 2 (AP2) and approximately 5 g of shredded PET. At  T0 the cultures were 
adjusted to an  OD600 of 0.4 and expression of the recombinant protein (AP_SP‑PETaseR280A‑FLAG) was induced with nitrate. Samples of 1 ml were 
taken at individual time points (T, 1 day = 24 h) and fresh nitrate was supplemented to the cultures at  T3,  T6 and  T10. The standards used for UHPLC

year out. Many plastic materials are highly durable and 
resistant to biological degradation through e.g., micro -
organisms. The recently discovered PETase is a bacterial 
hydrolase possessing the ability for PET degradation [13]. 
Recent studies on PETase demonstrate the potential of 
the enzyme for possible applications in biological PET 
degradation and recycling (see e.g., [13–18, 30, 32]). In 
this work, we expand the possible range of applications 
for PETase via generating a synthetic microbial cell fac
-
tory in the form of a marine microalga capable of produc-
ing and secreting functional PETase that can efficiently 
decompose PET in a saltwater-based environment.
By means of expression and localization studies of 
GFP fusion proteins as well as Western Blot analyses, 
our studies show that the marine diatom P. tricornutum 
is a suitable chassis for the production of recombinant 
 PETase
R280A-FLAG and its secretion into the medium 
fraction (Figs.  1, 2, Additional file  1: Figure S1). The lat -
ter is possible either by expressing PETase with the origi -
nal bacterial SP of I.  sakaiensis PETase, or as a synthetic 
construct in which the SP of a well-known secreted fac -
tor of the diatom, alkaline phosphatase (AP) [29], was 
used. Western Blot analyses of several PETase-GFP and 
-FLAG producing P.   tricornutum clones revealed that 
the constructs with a FLAG-tag were secreted much 
more efficiently than those containing a GFP-tag (Fig.  2 
and Additional file  1: Figure S1), which is not surprising 
and might be due to the massive increase in theoretical 
molecular mass (GFP: + 27.5  kDa; FLAG: + 1  kDa) and 
size (bulky barrel-like structure of GFP) of the expressed 
GFP fusion protein probably hindering secretion by the 
diatom cell. With AP_SP-PETase
R280A-FLAG clone 2 we 
obtained a P. tricornutum mutant cell line capable of the 
highest production and secretion rates of the recombi -
nant enzyme upon induction of expression when com -
pared to other generated clones (Fig. 2).
As evident from several Western Blots, a mass shift 
of the diatom-produced recombinant PETase protein 
was observed during our experiments (Fig.  2 and Addi
-
tional file  1: Figure S1). Whereas the original I.  sakaien-
sis PETase protein has a molecular mass of 30.1 kDa, the 
theoretical values for the here synthesized recombinant 
versions are 57.7 for  PETase
R280A-GFP and 30.4  kDa for 
AP_SP-PETaseR280A-FLAG. However, when immunode -
tection with an antibody specific for the FLAG-tag was 
performed signals with higher molecular masses in the 
range of at least 10–25 kDa more could be detected. Via 
mass spectrometry, these bands could be identified as 
 PETase
R280A-FLAG unequivocally (Additional file  1: Fig-
ure S2, Additional file  2: Tables S1 and S2). As already 
shown for endogenous as well as secreted recombinantly 
expressed proteins, typical eukaryotic post-translational 
modifications in the form of N-glycosylation can occur 
in P.  tricornutum [33–35]. We exemplarily tested the 
post-translational modification of AP_SP-PETase
R280A-
FLAG via N-glycosylation by PNGase F (cleaves N-linked 
oligosaccharides) treatment and observed that the mass 
increase of the specific protein band was indeed lesser 
when potential N-linked glycans were removed enzy
-
matically (Additional file  1: Figure S3). This clearly indi -
cates that at least a part of the observed mass increase 
of the recombinant protein was due to N-glycosylation 
taking place in the diatom cell. This observation also cor
-
relates with the presence of predicted N-glycosylation 
sites in the AP_SP-PETase
R280A-FLAG sequence (see 
Additional file  1: Figure S12) and the results of the mass 
spectrometric analyses in which certain peptides (result -
ing from tryptic digestion), including predicted N-gly -
cosylation sites, likely due to deviating masses could not 
be identified (Additional file  2: Tables S1 and S2). How
-
ever, to explain the huge increase in molecular mass of 
 PETase
R280A-FLAG, further post-translational modifica -
tions, such as, for example, O-glycosylation of the protein 
by P. tricornutum, have to be considered (and postulated) 
as well. Whether the post-translational modifications of 
 PETase
R280A-FLAG in P.   tricornutum have an influence 
on its catalytic activity or substrate specificity is so far 
unknown and will be (in parallel to their identity) investi
-
gated in more detail in future studies.
In any case, the results of our studies indicate that 
 PETaseR280A-FLAG—an engineered version of I.  sakaien-
sis PETase with increased activity [14]—produced and 
secreted by P.   tricornutum possesses catalytic activity 
against PET as well as PETG copolymer. This could be 
shown by several PET/PETG degradation experiments 
with diatom cells growing on solid f/2-saltwater agar as 
well as in liquid cell culture (Fig.  3, 4, 5 and Additional 
files 1, 2). The proof of principle of enzyme functionality 
was provided in the course of a PET bottle film decom
-
position approach on solid agar (Fig.  3) in which partial 
degradation of the substrate was achieved after several 
weeks of incubation. The observed structural changes 
(holes and cavities) in the PET surface were comparable 
to those reported in earlier PET degradation experiments 
using PETase [13, 15], strongly indicating that the dia
-
tom produced  PETaseR280A-FLAG enzyme was capable of 
decomposing bottle PET.
As we had generated several promising diatom mutants 
efficiently producing and secreting  PETaseR280A-FLAG 
into the medium (Fig.  2), we aimed at scaling up the 
approach and reducing reaction time and thus changed 
to a liquid saltwater environment (cell culture) for fur -
ther studies. Initially, PET as well as PETG decomposi -
tion was tested at 30 °C—temperature conditions nearly 
optimal for PETase [13, 30], but not for P.   tricornutum 
cell growth [36]. For this, we used only 1 ml of a diatom 
Page 10 of 15Moog et al. Microb Cell Fact          (2019) 18:171 
culture synthesizing  PETaseR280A-FLAG and incubated 
the fraction with commercial PETG or bottle PET film. 
While the approach with commercial highly amorphous 
PETG copolymer film proved to be highly successful 
(Fig.  4, Additional file  1: Figures  S7, S8), only little PET 
degradation could be observed for bottle PET incubated 
with  PETase
R280A-FLAG containing f/2-medium (Addi -
tional file  1: Figure S9, Additional file  2: Table  S3). A 
rough estimation of the formed products of the degrada -
tion reaction catalyzed by  PETaseR280A-FLAG (Additional 
file 2: Table S3) under the selected conditions suggested 
an approximately 80-fold higher turnover of PETG than 
bottle PET. These results indicate that the diatom-pro
-
duced  PETaseR280A-FLAG possesses different specificities 
for different PET substrates, which, among other things, 
might be due to the degree of crystallinity of the different 
polymer materials that has an influence on their biodeg
-
radability (see e.g., [37]). However, the results show that 
not only PET but also PETG copolymer can be degraded 
by the  PETase
R280A-FLAG produced and secreted by 
P. tricornutum.
When we scaled up our liquid PET/PETG degrada -
tion experiments to diatom culture size (50–500 ml), we 
again recognized differences in PET turnover depend
-
ing on the form of the substrate. Although the liquid 
approach at P. tricornutum culturing conditions (see 
“Methods”) using industrially shredded PET as substrate 
was highly successful (see Fig.  5 and Additional file  1: 
Figure S11), PET and PETG film (bottle and commercial) 
substrates were not or rather poorly degraded by the 
diatom produced and secreted  PETase
R280A-FLAG. This 
observation is most likely due to several circumstances 
causing suboptimal reaction conditions for the enzyme. 
First, the majority of experiments were performed at 
21  °C, the optimal growth temperature of P. tricornu
-
tum, or 26  °C, which is an almost critical temperature 
point for diatom growth/survival. Both temperatures are 
suboptimal for PETase activity, which has its tempera
-
ture optimum near 35  °C [13, 30]. Second, agitation of 
the culture, which is necessary for optimal growth of P. 
tricornutum, might also have impaired PETase effectiv
-
ity, especially to attach to the rather smooth surface of 
PET/PETG film substrates. Third, the composition of 
the f/2-medium in which the diatoms grow might have 
influenced PETase function, although it was shown ear
-
lier that salt can increase activity of the enzyme [30]. 
Another factor might be the general nature of the sub
-
strate. Whereas shredded PET possesses an enhanced, 
rough surface providing ample contact sites and starting 
points for PETase activity, larger pieces of PET film with 
a smooth surface (and a potentially higher polymer crys
-
tallinity) are most likely much harder to be efficiently 
attacked by PETase-FLAG (see above). Our findings 
thus suggest that so far only shredded PET can be effi
-
ciently degraded by diatom produced PETase-FLAG 
in cultures with living cells, while degradation of PET/
PETG film might require conditions more tailored to 
the enzyme’s needs than to those of the algal cell cul
-
ture. However, with respect to the overall potential of 
the diatom produced PETase for degradation of differ
-
ent PET substrates in culture, especially factors such as 
the growth rate of P. tricornutum in connection to the 
PETase expression level as well as enzyme activity and 
stability (half-life) will have to be analyzed in more detail 
and adjusted in future studies. Based on the stability of 
PETase-FLAG produced by the algae (accumulation in 
the medium fraction and stable for at least 7 days with
-
out appearance of recognizable protein degradation 
products; see Additional file  1: Figure S4), one possibility 
would be to use only the saltwater supernatant contain
-
ing the enzyme that can be heated up to the temperature 
optimum of PETase for a more efficient biodegradation 
of PET/PETG film (see Fig. 4 ).
As shown by the PET degradation experiments using 
industrially shredded material as a substrate (Fig.  5), 
MHET was produced first as a major component of PET 
degradation by PETase-FLAG accompanied by a lower 
increase of TPA until  T
3 (Fig.  5). At  T6 this situation 
changed in that the amount of TPA present in the sample 
abruptly passed the MHET level by an increase more than 
threefold (see also Additional file 2: Table S3). From  T
6 to 
 T10 MHET then decreased to a minimum level that did 
not change significantly in the last measurement  (T14). 
A very similar observation was made for an independent 
experiment using a different clone (AP_SP-PETase
R280A-
FLAG clone 1) in which MHET basically disappeared 
at  T
10, while the TPA level was still slightly increasing 
(Additional file 1: Figure S11). This observation might be 
explained by two potential scenarios: in the first one the 
here synthesized  PETase
R280A-FLAG functions similar 
to PETase reported in earlier studies producing MHET 
and TPA as main products, not being able to further 
decompose generated MHET [14]. The almost complete 
absence of MHET from  T
10 might be due to PETase-
independent turnover or removal of the substance by a 
so far unknown factor. In putative scenario two, the engi
-
neered version of I.  sakaiensis PETase  (PETaseR280A [14]), 
produced in this experiment might be able not only to 
degrade PET into TPA under the chosen conditions, but 
also further decompose MHET into TPA. However, this 
is in contrast to previous observations that suggested that 
the original I. sakaiensis PETase is not able to decompose 
MHET [13, 14]. In addition, while having maintained 
constant induction of  PETase
R280A-FLAG expression by 
supplementation of the culture with fresh nitrate at sev -
eral time points, the less increasing (Fig.  5, Additional 
Page 11 of 15
Moog et al. Microb Cell Fact          (2019) 18:171 
file 2: Table S3) or rather stagnant level (Additional file 1: 
Figure S11) of TPA from  T10 together with the absence of 
MHET suggest that the PET degradation gradually comes 
to a halt. The reason for this might be the decay of the 
culture caused by a lack of nutrients, such as phosphate, 
vitamins and trace elements that have been used up by 
the growing diatoms. As a consequence, PETase produc
-
tion is shut down, which might explain the reduced TPA 
increase/static TPA level and the continuing absence 
of MHET. Moreover, as mentioned earlier, it cannot be 
excluded that potential post-translational modifica
-
tions of  PETaseR280A-FLAG (N-glycosylation, etc.) might 
have altered the enzymatic activity or substrate specific -
ity of the enzyme enabling the further decomposition of 
MHET into TPA. A potentially extended substrate range 
of the diatom-produced PETase will be investigated in 
detail in future experiments.
Conclusions
Taken together, our studies provide the proof of princi -
ple that  PETaseR280A-FLAG produced by a marine dia -
tom is functional for PET degradation under (mesophilic 
marine) growth conditions of the model system. In detail 
we showed efficient production and secretion of the 
recombinant proteins, enzyme functionality with respect 
to different PET substrates (PET and PETG film and 
shredded PET) under varying conditions highlighting the 
enormous potential for further experiments and applica
-
tions with respect to biological PET degradation. These 
include the design and development of photobioreac
-
tors for PET bioremediation as well as the development 
of efficient closed- or open-loop recycling strategies for 
TPA (and EG) to synthetize new PET from its own deg
-
radation products up to the point of further metabolic 
engineering of the microalgal metabolism in order to 
generate cells capable of completely metabolizing PET 
and use it as a carbon source. Moreover, the results of our 
studies might be instrumental and pave the way for self-
contained applications helping to decrease the currently 
enormous plastics pollution on our planet, especially 
with respect to saltwater environments—i.e., the oce
-
anic ecosystems—(closed bioremediation systems). An 
important benefit of the model system used in this study 
for PETase production is that the diatom is a marine, 
photosynthetic organism. Its habitat is marine water—the 
place where the majority of non-recycled plastic waste 
(macro- and micro-plastic) finally ends up on our planet. 
Thus, the here generated microbial cell factory might not 
only be useful for climate friendly PET recycling, but also 
an application in delimited sewage plant-like bioreactor 
systems for oceanic microplastic decomposition might be 
conceivable.
Methods
Plasmid construction, transfection of diatoms and confocal 
microscopy
The gene encoding an engineered version of I. sakaien -
sis PETase (Is PETaseR280A) [14] was synthesized by Syn -
bio Technologies (USA) according to the codon usage of 
P. tricornutum with a 5′ EcoRI and a 3′ BamHI restric -
tion site and cloned together with egfp  (BamHI/HindIII) 
into the nitrate inducible pPha-NR shuttle vector (NCBI 
accession number: JN180663). To generate a version of 
PETase efficiently secreted by the diatom, the petase gene 
was modified at the 5′- and 3′-ends. The gene sequence 
encoding the original bacterial signal peptide was 
replaced by a gene region encoding the signal peptide 
of P.  tricornutum alkaline phosphatase (Phatr2: 49678, 
first 30  aa), a protein that is secreted into the extracel
-
lular environment by the diatom [29]. At the 3′-end, gfp 
was replaced by a FLAG-tag (DYKDDDDK) encoding 
sequence, followed by a stop codon and a HindIII restric
-
tion site. Both modifications were induced via oligonu -
cleotide primer sequences synthesized by Sigma-Aldrich 
specific to petase that were extended for the particular 
gene region (5′: GAA  TTC ATG AAA TTC TCT ACT GCC

tions using the  Q5® High-Fidelity 2X Master Mix (NEB). 
Generated artificial gene sequences were cloned into the 
pJet1.2/blunt plasmid using the CloneJET PCR Cloning

ing (Macrogen), before they were cloned into pPha-NR 
(see above). High purity plasmid of a 50  ml Escherichia 
coli culture was then isolated via the  NucleoBond
® Xtra 
Midi/Maxi kit (Macherey–Nagel) and transformation of 
P. tricornutum wild type cells was performed as described 
previously [38]. To analyze the expression and locali
-
zation of GFP fusion proteins, confocal laser scanning 
microscopy (CLSM) was performed. For this, expression 
of the GFP fusion proteins was induced by incubation 
of the transformed cells for 24  h in liquid f/2-medium 
containing 0.9 mM  NaNO
3 as a nitrogen source (activa -
tion of the nitrate reductase promoter). The cells were 
analyzed using a Leica TCS SP2 confocal laser scanning 
microscope equipped with a HCX PL APO 40×/1.25–
0.75 Oil CS objective. GFP fluorescence was excited at 
488  nm by a 65  mW Argon laser, while excitation was 
detected between 500 and 520 nm. In parallel, the auto
-
fluorescence of the plastid was excited at 488 nm as well 
and its emission was detected between 625 and 720 nm. 
Obtained images were processed digitally with Leica LAS 
AF lite and ImageJ [39].

Cell cultivation and PETase secretion analysis via Western 
Blot
Phaeodactylum tricornutum (strain Bohlin, UTEX646) 
cells were grown either in liquid or on solid saltwater f/2-
medium in constant light (24 h at 8000–10,000 Lux). The 
f/2-medium was consisting of the following ingredients: 
1.66% (w/v) Tropic Marin (Dr. Biener GmbH) salt, 2 mM 
Tris/HCl (pH 8.0), 36 µM  NaH
2PO4, either 1.5 mM  NH4Cl 
or 0.9 mM  NaNO3 was used as a nitrogen source, as well 
as vitamins and trace elements (see [40]). The pH of liq -
uid f/2-medium was adjusted to 8.0. For solid f/2-medium, 
1.3% (w/v) agar agar (Roth) was added. Selection and cul
-
tivation of transformed clones was conducted by using 
Zeocin (InvivoGen) of a final concentration of 75  µg/
ml as a supplement to the medium. Liquid cultures were 
grown under constant agitation (120–150 rpm). To analyse 
the secretion of recombinant proteins into the medium, 
50 ml P. tricornutum culture was grown for approximately 
1  week in f/2-medium containing 1.5  mM  NH
4Cl and 
adjusted to an optical density of 0.3 to 0.4  (OD600). Induc-
tion of protein expression was achieved by harvesting the 
cells (1500×g, 5  min., 21  °C) followed by a medium shift 
using f/2 containing 0.9  mM  NaNO
3 and further culti -
vation for 24  h to 7  days. The cells were pelletized again 
as before, washed with PBS or f/2-medium once and the 
supernatant (medium fraction) was filtrated (0.22 µm pore 
size). Subsequently the medium fraction was concentrated 
with centrifugal filter units  (Amicon
® Ultra-15) withhold-
ing proteins larger than 10 kDa (cutoff). Samples were con-
centrated to a volume less than 1000 µl and proteins within 
the concentrated medium fraction were precipitated with 
10% (v/v) trichloracetic acid (TCA). After two to three 
wash steps using 80% (v/v) ice-cold acetone proteins were 
dried under vacuum and dissolved in 15  µl SDS loading 
dye containing 8 M urea and 1% (v/v) β-mercaptoethanol.
From the pellet fraction a total protein extract was 
generated by resuspending the cells with 200  µl alka
-
line lysis buffer containing 1.7  M NaOH, 7.5% (v/v) 
β-mercaptoethanol and protease inhibitor cocktail. After 
incubation for 30 min on ice, the proteins were precipi
-
tated as described above and dissolved in 100 µl of SDS 
loading dye. 10 µg protein of the pellet fraction and the 
total volume of the medium fraction (15  µl) were sepa
-
rated via SDS-PAGE and transferred to a nitrocellulose 
membrane using Western Blot. For immunodetection 
antibodies against GFP (Rockland, 1:3000), α-tubulin 
(Sigma-Aldrich, 1:2000) and FLAG-tag (DYKDDDDK, 
Rockland, 1:2000) were used.
PNGase F assay
N-glycosylation of expressed recombinant proteins 
was analyzed using PNGase F (NEB) treatment. To this 
end, the supernatant (medium fraction) of a 500 ml cul
-
ture expressing the recombinant protein was filtered 
and concentrated (see above) to a volume of 250  µl in 
50  mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). 18  µl of the 
concentrated protein fraction was incubated with 1 µl of 
PNGase F enzyme under denaturating reaction condi
-
tions according to the manufacturer’s protocol. As a neg -
ative control, an identical amount of recombinant protein 
was subjected to the same treatment replacing PNGase 
F by reaction buffer. Final analysis of the protein fraction 
was performed via Western Blot (see above).
Plastic degradation experiments
PET degradation was analyzed in a solid and a liquid 
approach. For the solid approach, PET from a conven
-
tional bottle (Fiji water, 500 ml, specific polymer prop -
erties unknown) was cut into small pieces less than 
1 cm
2 in area. P.  tricornutum clones expressing AP_SP-
PETaseR280A-FLAG were grown on f/2 agar plates con -
taining nitrate  (NO3
−, inducing conditions) in direct 
contact to PET, which was sticking upright in the solid 
medium. The plate was overflowed with 2  ml nitrate-
containing liquid f/2-medium to generate an aqueous 
environment for enzymatic catalysis and incubated 
for 2 to 6  weeks under continuous light at 21  °C (see 
above). A P.  tricornutum wild type culture grown in 
direct contact to PET under similar conditions served 
as a negative control. The experimented was finished 
by removing the PET fragments from the plate and fol
-
lowed by further processing of the material for SEM 
analysis (see below).
In the liquid approach, P.   tricornutum clones trans -
formed with the gene encoding AP_SP-PETase R280A-
FLAG were grown in conical flasks containing 50, 150 
or 500  ml f/2-medium with  NH
4
+ (non-inducing con -
ditions) under agitation for approximately 1  week. As 
a control, a wild type culture was used. Both cultures 
were adjusted to the same optical density  (OD
600 
between 0.3 and 0.6) and cultivated further in f/2-
medium containing  NO
3
− (inducing conditions) 
together with 5 to 10 g of shredded PET (specific poly -
mer properties unknown), which was kindly provided 
by ALPLA-Werke Lehner GmbH & Co KG (Gemünden, 
Germany) at no cost. The shredded PET substrate was 
consisting of small pieces mostly less than 1 cm
2 in size 
with a considerable fraction of microplastic (≤  5  mm) 
and sterilized by a wash with 70% Ethanol for ≥ 12  h. 
The ethanol was removed by drying the PET under vac -
uum for at least 5 h. During incubation of the PET with 
the AP_SP-PETase
R280A-FLAG expressing cells and the 
wild type control, samples of 1  ml volume were taken 
from the supernatant at different time points at which 
Page 13 of 15
Moog et al. Microb Cell Fact          (2019) 18:171 
also fresh nitrate was added to the culture. The sam -
ples were filtrated (0.22 µm pore size), frozen in liquid 
nitrogen and stored at −  80 °C before they were further 
analyzed via ultra high performance liquid chromatog -
raphy (UHPLC, see below).
In addition, 1 ml supernatant of P.  tricornutum clones 
expressing AP_SP-PETaseR280A-FLAG or wild type was 
incubated for 1 to 2  weeks at 30  °C with small pieces 
(less than 1  cm
2 in size) of PET-based copolyester from 
a commercial film  (LUMEX®A, PETG SPECTAR ® Resin, 
Polycasa), a highly amorphous material consisting of 
polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG), with a thick
-
ness of 0.8  mm (specific physical properties unknown), 
or bottle PET film (see above). The PET fragment was 
removed and prepared for SEM (see below), whereas the 
liquid fraction was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at 
− 80 °C prior UHPLC analysis (see below).
Scanning electron microscopy of PETase treated PET 
samples
PET substrates (disks and square-cut parts) were treated 
with 1% SDS for at least 12 h and dried for ≥ 5 h under 
vacuum. The PET samples were than attached to sam
-
ple stubs (15 × 6 mm, Plano GmbH) and sputtered with 
gold under vacuum using a sputter coater (Balzers Union, 
Lichtenstein). The samples were analyzed using a Hitachi 
S-530 scanning electron microscope. Image processing 
was performed with ImageJ/Fiji [39].
Ultra high performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC) 
of PETase treated PET samples
PET degradation products in the growth medium were 
analyzed by UHPLC using an Infinity II system (Agi -
lent Technologies, CA, USA). Samples were either con -
centrated between six and eightfold by speedvac or ca. 
15-fold by lyophilization and subsequent redissolvation 
in water before they were applied to UHPLC. Standard 
compounds and PET degradation products (i.e., TPA and 
MHET) were monitored at 240  nm employing a diode 
array detector. TPA and MHET were separated on a 
reverse phase C18 column (Sonoma, 3 µm C18(2) 100 Å, 
10 cm × 2.1 mm; ES industries, NJ, USA) using a mobile 
phase system comprised of 50 mM phosphoric acid and 
methanol. Chromatographic separation was carried out 
using the following gradient conditions at 50  °C and a 
flow rate of 250 µl/min: 0 min 20% methanol; 2 min 20% 
methanol, 12 min 40% methanol. Approximations of TPA 
and MHET concentrations were calculated using the 
detected peak sizes/areas. Individual product peaks were 
collected and applied to UHPLC–MS (mass spectrom
-
etry) to verify their identities. UHPLC–MS analysis was 
carried out using a 6550 iFunnel Q-TOF LC–MS system 
(Agilent) equipped with an electrospray ionization source 
set to negative ionization mode. The analytes were sepa
-
rated on a RP-18 column (50 mm × 2.1 mm, particle size 
1.7 µm, Kinetex EVO C18, Phenomenex) using a mobile 
phase system comprised of 0.1% formic acid in water 
(A) and acetonitrile (B) with the following gradient con
-
dition at 40 °C and a flow rate of 250 µl/min: 0 min 5% 
B; 1  min 5% B, 6  min 95% B; 6.5  min 95% B; 7  min 5% 
B. For the MS, capillary voltage was set at 3.5  kV and 
nitrogen gas was used as nebulizing (20 psig), drying 
(13 l/min, 225 °C) and sheath gas (12 l/min, 40 °C). MS 
data were acquired with a scan range of 50–1100  m/z. 
LC–MS data were analyzed using MassHunter Qualita
-
tive Analysis software (Agilent) using the following exact 
mass traces: TPA [M−H]
− = 165.0193  m/z and MHET 
[M−H]− = 209.0455 m/z.
