Abstract
The handling of plastic waste and the associated ubiquitous occurrence of
microplastic poses one of the biggest challenges of our time. Recent investiga-
tions of plastic degrading enzymes have opened new prospects for biological
microplastic decomposition as well as recycling applications. For polyethylene
terephthalate, in particular, several natural and engineered enzymes are
known to have such promising properties. From a previous study that identi-
fied new PETase candidates by homology search, we chose the candidate PET6
from the globally distributed, halophilic organismVibrio gazogenesfor further
investigation. By mapping the occurrence ofVibrios containing PET6 homo-
logs we demonstrated their ubiquitous prevalence in the pangenome of several
Vibrio strains. The biochemical characterization of PET6 showed that PET6
has a comparatively lower activity than other enzymes but also revealed a
superior turnover at very high salt concentrations. The crystal structure of
PET6 provides structural insights into this adaptation to saline environments.
By grafting only a few beneficial mutations from other PET degrading enzymes
onto PET6, we increased the activity up to three-fold, demonstrating the evolu-
tionary potential of the enzyme. MD simulations of the variant helped ratio-
nalize the mutational effects of those mutants and elucidate the interaction of
the enzyme with a PET substrate. With tremendous amounts of plastic waste
in the Ocean and the prevalence ofVibrio gazogenes in marine biofilms and
estuarine marshes, our findings suggestthat Vibrio and the PET6 enzyme are
worthy subjects to study the PET degradation in marine environments.

1 | INTRODUCTION
Plastic pollution, which is considered an urgent current
threat, is a consequence of the massive popularity of plas-
tic materials starting in the 1950s paired with enduring
inadequate waste management worldwide. While the
world plastic production has grown to enormous 415 mil-
lion tons in 2016,
1 rates for recycling and incineration are
still low, with over 50% of the plastic waste being dis-
carded despite large improvements over the last decades.2
Within this setting, microbiological research has focused
on identifying plastic-active enzymes in the last decade.
For some polymers enzymes have been reported acting
on the polymers. These include ester-based polyure-
thanes (PU), and plastic polyethylene terephthalate
(PET) polyesters, which in principle can be cleaved by
members of the extensive class of hydrolases.
3 In the
scope of plastic pollution, hydrolases with activity on the
commodity PET came to the fore. Today, there are
40 PET-active enzymes known.
3 They are affiliated with
four bacterial and two fungal phyla. The first PET
degrading enzyme TfH was reported in 1998 by Kleeberg
et al., which was isolated from Thermobifida fusca
belonging to the order ofActinomycetales.
4,5 As members
of this order are common in the context of plant material
degradation, including cutin,
6 many PET degrading
enzymes identified were found from bacteria of this phy-
lum, including prominent TfCut2, Thc_Cut1, Est119, and
LCC.
7-11 Over the last years, protein engineering has been
applied to increase activity and thermostability of these
enzymes, enabling future recycling applications. Recently
a number of exciting articles have been published report-
ing improved catalytic activities of either IS, PET2, or
LCC.
12-19 A variety of strategies targeting sequence-based
knowledge, substrate-binding or the catalytic mechanism
have been used including machine-learning or directed
evolution that resulted in enhanced degradation capabili-
ties thereby emphasizing the high potential of engineered
PET-hydrolases. In fact, Tournier et al. already presented
a proof of concept for enzymatic PET recycling employ-
ing engineered variants of LCC.
20
In 2016, the discovery ofIdeonella sakaiensisas a bac-
terium that can exploit PET as sole energy and carbon
source attracted particular attention. 21 This ability is
facilitated by a two-enzyme system that consists of a
cutinase-like enzyme called PETase (IsPETase) undertak-
ing the coarse degradation whose main product mono-
(2-hydroxyethyl)-terephthalate (MHET) is further hydro-
lyzed by the second enzyme MHETase. The latter is
related to feruloyl esterase and shows a comparably high
specificity toward its substrate MHET,
22 and increases
PET hydrolysis rates of IsPETase when used together.23
In contrast to most previously characterized enzymes,
IsPETase shows decent activity at temperatures of 30–
40/C14C, implying the possibility for substantial PET degra-
dation in the environment. To evaluate this, the preva-
lence of such enzymes must be analyzed, and their actual
degradation activity on PET subsequently investigated.
Accordingly Danso et al. conducted a bioinformatic
search employing a hidden Markov model (HMM)
approach trained with the structure–function relation-
ships from known PET hydrolase to identify new poten-
tial enzymes in genomic samples from various
environments.
24 They identified several potential
enzymes, and PET hydrolase activity was measured
among others for PET6.24 This enzyme is found in the
proteobacteria Vibrio gazogenes from the genus Vibrio,
whose members are ubiquitously present in saline and
marine environments.25 A search in the PAZy database
identified two additional marine-derived enzymes origi-
nating from Pseudomonas aestusnigri and fromMarino-
bacter sp.
26,27 Of particular interest in the scope of plastic
pollution is their prevalence in estuaries, salt marshes,
and in the plastisphere, which describes the microbial
environment around plastic particles.
28–31 As there are
million tons of plastic particles in the oceans and rivers
as a main entrance path for plastic in the environment
32
mouthing in estuaries and neighboring salt marshes,
PET6 is an interesting candidate to investigate its PET
degradation potential. In particular, ecosystems like estu-
aries and salt marshes combine the reported prevalence
of Vibrio species and high concentrations of plastics and
microplastics.
33,34
Of the variants found and initially characterized in
the study by Danso et al.,24 PET6 ofVibrio gazogenesis a
representative that, in addition to its described PETase
activity, promises large-scale occurrence. It is well known
that Vibrio species are found nearly everywhere, espe-
cially in marine environments, where they play a critical
role in carbon and nitrogen cycling.
35 Furthermore,
atmospheric warming is enhancing the global occurrence
of this genus.36 In several studies describing the microbial
community on plastic debris (“plastisphere”), the genus
Vibrio was found to be the most abundant taxon able to
colonize PET (40%), polyethylene (PE, 30%) or polypro-
pylene (PP, 33%).37–39 Moreover, several pathogenic Vib-
rios have been identified on the aforementioned plastics
recovered from oceans, but also on polystyrene (PS) and
polyvinyl chloride (PVC; see table 1 in Bowley et al.40).
To which extent theseVibrios could be involved in degra-
dation of these plastics remains yet unknown. In this
study, we characterize PET6 from Vibrio gazogenes in
detail and evaluate its potential for PET degradation in
near-realistic saline conditions. This enables insights into

the adaptation of this enzyme toward its environment
and allows for a rough estimation of whether members of
the genus Vibrio might facilitate PET degradation in the
environment.
2 | RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
2.1 | Global prevalence of PET6
homologs in theVibrio genus
We aimed at identifying other putative PET-degrading
Vibrios by performing a BLASTp search against NCBI's
non-redundant database filtered for Vibrio spp. (taxid
662). This resulted in eight hits with full coverage and
more than 79% sequence identity compared to the PET-
hydrolyzing PET6 in V. gazogenes , V. spartinae ,
V. ruber, V. zhugei,a n dV. palustris (Table S1). All of
these species were isolated from marine or saline
environments,
41–44 implying possible adaption to saline
conditions.
A pangenomic analysis of one representative genome
of each PETase-containing Vibrio spp. revealed a core
genome of 1,824 gene clusters (GCs; Figure 1), which
included all putative PETases. The accessory genome ran-
ged from 1,392 to 2,321 GCs for the analyzed isolates.
Due to their high sequence similarity, all five PETases
were allocated in the same GC. According to Average
Nucleotide Identity (ANI) analysis, the analyzed Vibrio
species belong to two distinct lineages, where additional
1,050 and 805 GC are shared exclusively between the
members. This strongly suggests the horizontal transfer
of PETase genes within the genus (Figure
1). The“plasti-
sphere” of both aquatic and soil environments has been
identified as a“hotspot” for gene transfer.45,46 This is fur-
ther supported by the extended analysis in Figure S1,
including 28 additional genomes from representative
pathogenic and non-pathogenic Vibrios that do not con-
tain genes coding for PETases. ANI analysis revealed the
presence of two mainVibrio clades (I and II), where all
Vibrios with predicted PET-degrading ability were allo-
cated in Clade II. Again, the PETase-codingV. gazogenes,
V. spartinae, and V. ruber clustered closely together, but
V. palustris and V. zhugei appear closer related to
V. tritoniusand V. nitrifigilis.
Taken together, these results indicate that some Vib-
rios are theoretically equipped to act on PET, making
Vibrio-mediated PET hydrolysis in marine ecosystems
conceivable. The next step in the classification of PET6
and related enzymes in the Vibrio genus is a detailed
analysis including its activity. Here, we use PET6 as a
prototype.
2.2 | Characterization of PET6 activity
PET6 was expressed heterologously in Escherichia coli
and purified to homogeneity using an encoded histi-
dine tag. After purification, we first validated and char-
acterized the enzyme's capabilities to degrade PET.
Here, we employed our prev iously developed assay
platform for PET degradation, which works with a
PET-coating inside standard lab consumables as sub-
strate.
47 The coating was prepared from post-consumer

PET bottles to achieve a near-realistic substrate with a
crystallinity of around 10%. Besides the general capac-
ity for PET degradation, the enzyme's individual
optima regarding temperature and ionic strength were
investigated. Since PET6 was derived from a marine
organism, the experimental setup for examining the
enzyme's activity in the presence of salt covered
sodium chloride concentrations between 25 and
2,500 mM (Figure
2a). Similarly, we determined the
optimum temperature in the range from 30 to 55 /C14C
(Figure 2b). As a reference, the well-studied IsPETase
was included for both quan titative benchmark and
qualitative comparison of the determined optima. The
activity was determined byU H P L Cs u m m i n gu pT P A ,
BHET, and MHET to the total product release. As IsPE-
Tase showed substantially higher activity at the given
conditions, the concentration was adjusted to fit the
substrate limits of the assay. Therefore, IsPETase was
used at 20 nM while PET6 was employed at 2μM.
The results indicate that IsPETase has a relatively
broad temperature range for activity with an optimum
around 30
/C14C, whereas PET6 shows a distinct optimum
between 45 and 50/C14C. The different behavior of the two
enzymes is even more noticeable when looking at the
impact of ionic strength on the PET degradation activity.
While PET6 shows little activity at low salt concentra-
tions, the product release increases rapidly with an opti-
mum between 1 and 1.5 M NaCl. In contrast, IsPETase
displays the opposite behavior toward salt with an opti-
mum at low salt and rapidly decreasing activity with ris-
ing ionic strength.
2.3 | Structural analysis
Next, we aimed to investigate if the differences between
IsPETase and PET6 activity are reflected on a molecular
level. Thus, crystal trials were set up and an X-ray struc-
ture of PET6 was obtained. The solved structure (PDB ID
7Z6B) shows three protein entities in the asymmetric
unit. The maps allowed the modelling of three phos-
phates, two sodium and one chloride ion that are sym-
metrically arranged around each chain (Figures 3a
and S2).
As indicated by the sequence similarity to other PET
degrading enzymes, PET6 can be identified as an enzyme
of the alpha/beta hydrolase fold. The characteristic topol-
ogy of this class features eight beta-strands connected
with alpha-helices and a conserved arrangement of the
catalytic triad (Ser163, Asp209, and His241), with all of
them present in PET6 (Figure
3b,c). As observed in other
PETase crystal structures, all these enzymes are highly
alike, with only minor differences in loop regions. The
pseudo symmetry indicated by the crystallographic
parameters is also reflected in the asymmetric unit of the
solved structure. The arrangement of the three protein
chains, including surrounding and bound ions, is highly
symmetric (Figure
3c). Consequently, the chains show an
all-atom RMSD of only 0.61–0.68 Å among each other.
PET6 features three disulfide bonds labeled DS 1 –3
(Figure 3b,c,e). DS 1 is located close to the C-terminus,
formed between residue 277 and 294, and conserved in
all cutinases. Therefore, it was included in the HMM
search model from Danso et al.
24 The second disulfide

(blue line) were incubated for 18 hr at a concentration of 2μM and 20 nM, respectively. (a) The effect of salt concentrations on the two
enzymes varied between 0 and 2,500 mM (measured in 96-well reaction plates at 30/C14C). (b) Different incubation temperatures in the range

bond DS 2 connects residue 206 and 243 and is located
close to the active site. This disulfide bond position has
been mainly described for fungal cutinases but is also
found in IsPETase. DS 3 is located near the N-terminus
between residue 27 and 30 and is not commonly
described for PET hydrolases or cutinases.
The presence of three coordinated ions per chain in
the asymmetric unit is of particular interest. Binding sites
for divalent cations such as Ca
2+,Z n2+, and Mg2+ have
been described for several cutinases and PET hydrolases,
showing stabilizing effects and increasing activity when
bound.48 PET6, on the contrary, shows binding of mono-
valent ions with one sodium ion coordinated by the car-
bonyl oxygens of the residues Arg 61, Ala 63, and Phe 65;
the typical octahedral coordination is completed by three
water molecules (Figure
3d). The same set up is repeated
for a second sodium ion, interacting with the residues
Asp 282, Ser 284, and Val 287. A chloride ion can be

modeled in a shallow pocket created by the residues Ala
208, Asp 209, Ala 210, Val 211, Ser 240, His241, Phe 242.
Comparison of these ion binding sites with other cutinase
structures revealed the same chloride binding site in
Thc_Cut1 (PDB-ID:
5LUI,2 /C2Mg2+,3 /C2Cl/C0) and Cut190
(PDB-ID: 4WFK). The latter further shares the ion bind-
ing site around the residues 61, 63, and 65 of PET6
(Figure 3d) but coordinates a Ca2+ instead. This behavior
toward monovalent ions might be a result of adapting to
saline environments with high sodium chloride concen-
trations. Furthermore, it hints at how salt concentrations
might impact the enzyme's activity.
Due to the similarity of IsPETase and PET6
(Figure
3c), the resulting shape and surface are also
highly alike (Figure3f), with slight differences in the loop
regions and positioning of side chains. The predicted
binding site of the PET strand for IsPETase is a very dis-
tinct shallow binding groove on both sides of the active
site. Docking studies conducted by Joo et al. proposed an
L-shaped binding pose.
49 A part of this binding site
described by the authors is formed by a series of six resi-
dues, which are referred to as the extended loop. The sur-
face of PET6 shows a similarly shaped binding groove
but with one knob blocking the upper leg of the hypo-
thetical L-binding site, as visible in the figure of the
superimposed surfaces (Figure
3f). This knob originates
from Tyr248, while IsPETase's corresponding residue
within the extended loop region is the smaller aspara-
gine
49 (Figure 3e). The B-factors of Tyr248, including the
sidechain, show no abnormalities compared to the neigh-
boring residues. Thus, there is no sign of particular flexi-
bility that might indicate a flipping out movement.
Consequently, this tyrosine might comprise an obstacle
for an analogous binding mode to the one proposed for
IsPETase and, therefore, might reduce activity. Yet the
mode of this L-shaped binding has also been questioned,
mainly asking whether the PET substrate would take on
the necessary conformation for that binding mode.
50
2.4 | PET6 variants
To explore the evolutionary potential of PET6, we tested
some mutants of the enzyme. The first variant targets the
tyrosine in the extended loop of PET6 that was revealed
in the crystal structure. To check if this tyrosine hinders
substrate-binding based on the mode described by Joo
et al.,
49 we mutated this residue to the less bulky alanine
(PET6-YLA, mutation Y248A). In a second variant, the
entire extended loop (residues 246 –251, sequence
TGYPSE) was exchanged with the SGNSNQ-sequence
from IsPETase (PET-ExLoop). Joo et al.
49 had also
reported the conservation of Thr88 and Ala89 (IsPETase
numbering), which we transferred to PET6, changing the
corresponding valine to threonine and serine to alanine,
creating PET6-VSTA (mutations V91T, S92A). The three
variants were benchmarked against each other and IsPE-
Tase as reference. In this comparison, two salt concentra-
tions (50 and 1,000 mM NaCl), and three different
temperatures (30, 40, and 50
/C14C) were tested. Due to the
significantly higher activity of IsPETase compared to
PET6, IsPETase was employed in a lower concentration
to fit within the experimental substrate limits; eventually,
the results were extrapolated accordingly by a factor of
10 to compare them to the PET6 variants (Figure
4c,d).
At the lower salt concentration of 50 mM, all PET6
variants show considerably lower activity (Figure 4a).
Yet, there is a trend that introduced mutations lead to
improvements in activity, especially at 30
/C14C. At higher
temperatures, the increase in activity is less significant or
entirely within the error margin as for 50/C14C. The variant
VSTA stands out, showing the best improvements but for
50/C14C, where the performance breaks down dramatically
to a total product release of 0.05 mM compared to
0.2 mM of the other variants, including PET6-wt. At 1 M
salt, the PET degradation is, as expected, much higher for
all PET6 variants (Figure
4b), but especially at 40 and
50/C14C, the introduced mutations led to a significant
increase in performance. In particular, this is true for
PET6-ExLoop and VSTA at 40/C14C where the total product
release reaches 0.31 ± 0.06 and 0.27 ± 0.05μM, respec-
tively, compared to 0.08 ± 0.01μM for the wild type.
Somewhat less improvement can be seen at 50/C14C, where
PET6-ExLoop and PET6-VSTA outperform PET6-wt by
79 and 58%, respectively. In contrast, the single mutant
PET6-YLA, reconstructing the aforementioned L-shaped
binding site by removing the tyrosine as an obstacle in
the binding groove, shows only a slight improvement in
all conditions. However, the exchange of the whole
extended loop improved the PET degradation perfor-
mance, especially at 40–50
/C14C and 1 M salt, suggesting a
more complex contribution of these residues. Given these
results, PET6-VSTA is an appealing candidate for further
experiments, for one because of its massive boosts in
activity with only two mutations compared to the wild
type, and for the other due to its surprising performance
drop at 50
/C14C at low salt.
When we compare these results of PET6-wt and
PET6-VSTA with IsPETase, in the presence of 50 mM
NaCl, IsPETase is magnitudes more active at all tempera-
tures with an extrapolated total product release between
21 and 45 μM in contrast to 0.02 –0.2 μM for
PET6-variants (Figure
4c). As seen in previous experi-
ments (Figure 2b), the performance of IsPETase
decreases at temperatures around 50/C14C (Figure 4c). At
1 M sodium chloride, IsPETase's performance decreases
6o f1 6 WEIGERT ET AL.

to a total product release of 5.6μMa t3 0/C14C, which is fur-
ther reduced with rising temperatures. This opposite tem-
perature preference of PET6 and IsPETase culminates at
50
/C14C, where PET6-VSTA and PET6-wt take the lead with
1.8 and 1.1 μM product release over IsPETase with
0.9 μM after extrapolation. This proves a decent PET deg-
radation potential of PET6 under appropriate conditions
and categorizes it as PET hydrolase according to Kawai
et al.51
In general, these results suggest that temperature and
thereby protein stability in combination with salt might
be crucial for PET6-wt activity, as well as for its variants
and IsPETase. Therefore, DSC measurements were car-
ried out for PET6-wt and PET-VSTA at 50, 500, and
1,000 mM NaCl to determine the melting temperature
and investigate this interplay.
The analysis shows that higher salt levels generally
stabilize the proteins, for example, PET6-wt gains around
7
/C14Ci n Tm from 49.8 to 57.7/C14C (Figure 4e). The same
applies in principle for the PET6-VSTA variant, but the
two introduced mutations show a destabilizing effect
accounting for a 0.5–1/C14C decrease in Tm compared to
PET6-wt at corresponding salt levels. Nevertheless, there
is an evident trend in how PET6 benefits from improved
stability at higher salt concentrations. Furthermore, the
data offers a possible explanation as to why the perfor-
mance of PET6-VSTA breaks down at 50
/C14C and low salt
in contrast to the wildtype. Both enzymes are employed
near or even above theirTm in this condition. However,
the small additional destabilization by about 0.6/C14C upon
the mutations in PET6-VSTA might be sufficient to cause
this dramatic activity loss.
Interestingly, the stability of IsPETase is also
increased with higher salt concentrations from 46.2/C14Ca t
50 mM to 52.7/C14C at 1 M salt. However, this enhanced sta-
bility does not translate to higher activity (Figure 4).
Once more, this demonstrates the close relation between
PET6 performance and ionic strength, which raises the
question, whether the type of monovalent ions plays a
role. A natural candidate, besides sodium and chloride, is
potassium. It is not only a typical component of seawater
with high similarity to sodium but also present in the
FIGURE 4 Performance of PET6 variants compared to IsPETase at varying temperatures and salt concentrations. PET6 variants (green)
were used at a concentration of 2μM and IsPETase (blue) at 200 nM and incubated for 18 hr. Therefore, the total product release of
IsPETase was extrapolated by a factor of 10 to obtain comparable results within the activity experiments (a–d). The performance of the PET6
variants at different temperatures is compared in (a) at 50 mM and (b) at 1 M salt. The same data is shown in (c) and (d) for PET6-wt and
PET6-VSTA with IsPETase for comparison; therefore, they-axis is log10 scaled to account for strongly varying performance levels. (e) Shows

successful crystallization condition containing sodium-
potassium phosphate. Compounds in crystallization con-
ditions often have stabilizing effects on the protein, even-
tually promoting crystallization. Another series of DSC
measurements were conducted to test whether 10 mM
potassium chloride has a stabilizing effect. However,
there is no clear difference in the measurements between
corresponding conditions (Figure
4e). The effect of potas-
sium ions on the activity itself was tested in an experi-
mental setup with 1 M salt as a base to minimize the
relative increase in total ionic strength upon adding
10 mM potassium chloride. After incubation at 50
/C14C for
18 hr the total product release of PET6-wt increased
about 10% from 476 ± 22μM to 524 ± 33μM, while ris-
ing by 8% for PET6-VSTA from 745 ± 47μM to 810
±8 6μM. Despite the high standard deviation, these
results strongly suggest a positive impact of potassium
ions. Under the given conditions, 10 mM KCl
corresponds only to a rise of about 1% of the total ionic
strength, making it unlikely that this performance
increase can only be attributed to the increased ion con-
centration in general. Additionally, divalent ions includ-
ing Ca
2+,C o2+,C u2+,M g2+,M n2+,N i2+, and Zn2+ have
been tested in a concentration of 10 mM, but no increase
in activity could be detected. This emphasizes the prefer-
ence of PET6 toward monovalent ions and their specific
impact on its activity in contrast to other cutinases and
their interaction with divalent metal ions.

with the polymer. For this we employed a PET tetramer
as model substrate in molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations. The parameters were set to 323 K and
a total ionic strength of 1,050 mM representing the high
salt condition where PET6-wt showed the best perfor-
mance in experiments. For each complex, several trajec-
tories comprising a total of 400 ns were analyzed to
calculate protein –ligand interaction fingerprints and
binding modes using the analysis tool ProLIF.
52 We ana-
lyzed the binding of the PET tetramer to PET6-wt and
PET6-VSTA using cluster analysis on the basis of the
Tanimoto coefficient using k
Means with the Silhouette
score (Figure 5). A single dot represents a similarity of
the binding motifs (the darker the dot, the more similar
are the binding motifs). In the Tanimoto similarity matri-
ces (Figure
5a), we observe clusters with different size
and different specificities. All clusters define energetic
minima on the energy landscape. Larger clusters repre-
sent deeper energy minima. The higher the average Tani-
moto coefficient in the cluster, the more similar is the
binding motif in the cluster, which can be interpreted as
a higher binding specificity of the substrate to the
protein.
For PET6-wt, we identified seven clusters with differ-
ent binding modes (Figure
5a,b). The clusters 0, 1, 3, 5,
and 6 represent structurally well-defined energetic min-
ima. The clusters 2 and 4 are less specific. Thus, in
PET6-wt, we found several minima of which five are rela-
tively specific but nevertheless they differ structurally
among each other. In contrast to PET6-wt, we identified
only two clusters for PET6-VSTA. Cluster 0 is large and
represents a structurally specific and strongly pro-
nounced energetic minimum, whereas cluster 1 is less
specific. Hence, the binding of the PET tetramer to
PET6-VSTA is more specific than the binding to
PET6-wt. Nevertheless, PET6-wt and PET6-VSTA show
both that the substrate interacts favorably in the region
around the active site.
Binding of PET involves the same residues in
PET6-wt and PET-VSTA, namely Tyr90, Trp162, Met164,
Trp187, Leu189, Val211, and Phe242 (Figure
5c). These
residues define a region, which is approximately binding
two units of the PET tetramer. A further frequent contact
with the PET tetramer is located around Ser95 and indi-
cates a potential binding region for another PET unit. In
that region, we further see pronounced interactions with
Ser96, Asn245, and Thr246 for PET6-VSTA, which are
rather sparse for PET6-wt. This finding is in line with the
defined interactions of a longer portion of the PET tetra-
mer with PET-VSTA. The MD trajectories of the two
enzymes indicate a dominance of π-stacking contacts
between the PET tetramer and the respective enzyme.
The share of frames within the trajectories, which show
π-stacking interactions is higher for the complex of
PET6-VSTA with the PET tetramer (93 ± 2%) compared
to the complex of PET6-wt with the PET tetramer (78
± 11%) reflecting a more defined interaction in the com-
plex of PET6-VSTA. In addition to the more defined bind-
ing of the substrate, we observed a higher contact
frequency between the ligand and the catalytic histidine
(His241) for PET6-VSTA (64 ± 14%) compared to
PET6-wt (18 ± 27%), which is beneficial for optimal bind-
ing to the active site. These observed differences are a
consequence of the introduced mutations Val91 to threo-
nine and Ser92 to alanine.
In PET6-VSTA, the hydroxyl group of Thr91 is fre-
quently close to aπ-system of the terephthalate units of
the PET tetramer indicating potential OH –π interac-
tions. The distance value at the maximum of the
observed distribution is 3.5 Å (Figure S3, maximum of
the estimated prob ability density function), which is
exactly the ideal value found in the literature.
53,54 In
addition, we observe a hyd rophobic contact between
Cβ of Ala92 and an ethyl linker of the PET tetramer.
Interestingly, the distance between the hydroxyl group
of Thr91 and the Cβ of Ala92 (5.1 Å, Figure S3) is about
t h ed i s t a n c eo ft h eπ-system of a terephthalate unit to
the ethyl linker in PET. This specific interaction is only
possible in PET6-VSTA and not in PET6-wt, which
explains a more specific interaction with the PET sub-
strate in the mutant.
In conclusion, the simulations show that the
exchange of Val91 and Ser92, which are present in all
natural PET6 variants, to threonine and alanine, respec-
tively, enhances the interactions of the PET tetramer
with PET6-VSTA. This enhanced substrate coordination
in the immediate vicinity to the active site might be one
cause for the improved PET degradation of PET6-VSTA.
The experimentally shown significant increase in PET
degradation induced by two small mutations in
PET6-VSTA further underpins the evolutionary potential
of PET6.
To date, there is some crystallographic data on the
substrate interaction of PET degrading enzymes, however
they rely on shorter substrate analogues instead of the
PET polymer.
16,55–57 In order to circumvent this limita-
tion, MD simulations can be employed, as done here. The
value and significance of this method has been demon-
strated by several studies that successfully generated
improved variants of PET degrading enzymes using MD
simulations.
14,58–60 These studies not only confirm a
mode of interaction comparable to the one we observe,
with a strong proportion of aromatic interactions and
simultaneous participation of polar interactions, but also
illustrate for example the diverse binding of the substrate
by means of several binding modes.

a fascinating adaptation toward its saline environment.
Sodium and chloride ions stabilize the protein and deci-
sively promote its activity. While the activity profile strongly
differs from IsPETase, similar trends have been observed
for other PET hydrolases and their interaction with divalent
cations. The optimal working conditions of the enzyme
were determined to be around 50
/C14Ca n d1–1.5 M salt. The
X-ray structure confirmed theexpected fold and stabilizing
interactions but also highlighted some differences that led
to testable mutants. MD simulations further revealed a sta-
ble interaction between enzymea n ds u b s t r a t ew i t hs p e c i f i c

mutant additionally provided insights into how the struc-
tural changes translate to an increased activity.
An ongoing discussion about PET degrading enzymes
is their actual contribution to PET waste decomposition
in the environment, which has not been assessed by any
study on an experimental level yet. Based on our find-
ings, we propose that PET6 is a worthy candidate to study
this topic. The genusVibrio is ubiquitous in saline envi-
ronments, and we demonstrated the prevalence of PET6
homologs in severalVibrio species. There is also a coinci-
dence of high plastic concentrations in salt marshes, estu-
aries, and oceans with the confirmed occurrence ofVibrio
in these environments and the plastisphere itself. As
recently shown by Menzel et al.
61 even comparatively
low levels of enzyme activity can significantly impact the
integrity and thus the fate of PET material. Hence, a PET
degradation activity of PET6 and its homologues in
marine and estuarine environments seems feasible.
4 | MATERIALS AND METHODS
4.1 | Bioinformatics analysis

(WP_021018894.1) as a query was performed against all
Vibrio proteomes (taxid 662) in the non-redundant data-
base from NCBI to identify closely related homologs of
the PETase (query coverage >99%, sequence identity
>80%). Multiple sequence alignments were carried out
with T-Coffee in Expresso mode.

4.2 | Cloning
The pet6 gene (residues 25 –297, NCBI Ref. Seq.
WP_077316261.1) was cloned into a pET28a vector
(Merck Millipore Novagen) via the restriction sitesNdeI
and SalI, creating a construct with a N-terminal 6x-
HisTag upon expression, while the IsPETase gene (resi-
dues 28–290) was inserted into a pET21b vector (Merck
Millipore Novagen) usingNdeI and XhoI to feature a C-
terminal 6x-HisTag upon expression. Primers for the
introduction of mutations were designed with the tool
NEBaseChanger (New England Biolabs), the PCR was
conducted according to the parameters suggested by the
design tool. After PCR cleanup, 6 μl DNA (≈50 ng/μl)
was combined with 1μl each of T4 Ligase Buffer (10/C2),
T4 Ligase (400 U/μl), DpnI (20 U/μl), and T4 PNK (10 U/
μl) (New England Biolabs) and incubated for 1 hr at
RT. After transformation of TOP10 cells with ligation
mix, positive clones were identified by DNA sequencing
(Eurofins Genomics GmbH).

4.3 | Protein production and purification
T7 Shuffle cells (New England Biolabs) were chemically
transformed with the vectors containing the genes of the
enzymes; afterward, the corresponding antibiotics were
constantly present in the media. Main cultures were
grown in TB media at 37
/C14C to an OD of 1.5 before the
temperature was lowered to 18/C14C, and protein expression
was induced by adding IPTG to a final concentration of
300 μM. After 18 hr, the cells were harvested by centrifu-
gation at 5,000g and resuspended in IMAC binding buffer
(300 mM NaCl, 50 mM phosphate, 50 mM Imidazole,
pH 7.4) with 10 ml/g wet weight. After sonication, cell
debris was removed by centrifugation for 1 hr at 50,000g
and vacuum filtrated through a 0.22μM filter. The clari-
fied lysate was loaded onto a Cytivia HisTrap 5 ml col-
umn. After washing with 20 column volumes
(CV) binding buffer, the protein was eluted with a linear
gradient (25 CV) of elution buffer (300 mM NaCl, 50 mM
phosphate, 400 mM Imidazole, pH 7.4). The purification
of the enzymes IsPETase and PET6 wildtype were
polished with a size exclusion (SEC) run on a Cytivia
Superdex 26/600 75 pg (SEC buffer: 150 mM NaCl,
25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4), while the PET6 variants were
dialyzed in SEC buffer after the IMAC step. Eventually,
the proteins were concentrated to 50–300 μM to prepare
aliquots of 100 μl, which were flash-frozen until
further use.
4.4 | Crystallization of PET6 and
structure determination
Sitting drop vapor diffusion experiments were conducted
with various premixed crystal screens, including the
JCSG Core Suite from Qiagen. The crystal screening was
done in Intelli 3-well plates which were set up with a
Crystal Phoenix (Art Robbins Instruments) setting drops
in a 1:1 ratio with 0.4μl each, where PET6 was used in a
concentration of 12.3 mg/mL. The protein crystallized in
a condition containing 0.1 M sodium potassium phos-
phate pH 6.2 and 35% 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol (MPD),
yielding crystals suitable for X-ray diffraction experi-
ments without further optimization. The obtained crys-
tals were frozen without the addition of a cryoprotectant
and diffraction data was collected at the BESSY synchro-
tron. Two datasets from the same crystal were recorded
at the beamline MX14.2 with 13.5 keV with an exposure
time of 0.1 s per 0.1
/C14and 2,000 images each. The datasets
were processed with XDSAPP 2 and merged with
Xdsconv. The crystallographic data quality indicators
show good results throughout with the resolution cut-off
at 1.4 Å resulting in a R-meas of 5.4% (30.0%), I/σ(I) of
19.45 (4.70), and CC1/2 of 99.9 (92.3), with the expression
in brackets as the respective value in the highest resolu-
tion (Table S2). However, the moderate data complete-
ness of 95.6% (91% in the highest resolution shell) is
typical for the P1 space group. The phase was solved
using Phenix Phaser employing a homology model of
PET6 generated by MODELLER.
69 Refinement and
model building was done with Phenix Refine 70 and
Coot.71 During processing and solving of the structure, it
could not be overlooked that this crystal with the triclinic
space group P1 is strongly tending toward a higher sym-
metry, the cell parameters (a = 44.8, b = 72.6, c = 72.8,
α = 119.8
/C14, β = 91.6/C14; γ = 91.8/C14) are very close to a hexag-
onal crystal system with theoretical cell dimensions
a = b ≠ c and α = β = 90/C14; γ = 120/C14. But processing the
data sets merged or unmerged at higher symmetry did
not successfully solve the structure, suggesting that
higher symmetry was distorted. This could be related to
the omission of cryoprotectant during the flash freezing
step, only relying on the present MPD in the condition
itself.
4.5 | Activity assay on PET
The PETase activity of the enzymes was measured by
incubating the enzymes in PET-coated 96-well microtiter
plates. The coating is part of an assay platform described
in detail in our previous paper.
47 In short, commercially
available post-consumer PET (CleanPET, Veolia GmbH)
is dissolved in trifluoroacetic acid and applied on 96-well
microtiter plates (Nunc 96-well clear, Fisher Scientific),
excess PET solution drained, and eventually, the plate is
dried at 63
/C14C to obtain the PET coating. For the actual
experiments, each well was filled with 50μl enzyme solu-
tion where 50 mM borate pH 8.5 was the basis while
enzyme and sodium chloride concentration as well as
incubation temperature and time were varied according
to the individual experiment. After incubation, the solu-
tion was mixed with four parts acetonitrile containing 1%
formic acid followed by centrifugation. The degradation
products were analyzed using the UHPLC (Thermofisher
Ultimate 3000 RS) system on a reversed phase C18 col-
umn (Kinetex 1.7μm EVO C18, 100 Å, 50/C22.1 mm Phe-
nomenex). For fast separation at a flow rate of
1.3 ml/min the following multi-slope gradient was
employed starting at 100% solvent A (water+ 0.1% TFA)
increasing acetonitrile as solvent B in the following pat-
tern: 0.04 min— 15%, 0.4 min — 20%, 0.75 min— 50%,
0.95 min— 80%, and 2.1 min— 80%. One microliter sam-
ples were injected onto the column; absorption was mea-
sured at 240 nm at a rate of 50 Hz. Six to 30 replicates
were used for every condition to calculate a mean total

product release where TPA, MHET, and BHET are
combined.
4.6 | Differential scanning calorimetry
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) runs were done
with the proteins under different buffer conditions to
determine the stability and melting point of the enzymes.
While the buffer basis was kept constant with 50 mM
borate pH 8.5, sodium chloride concentrations were var-
ied (50, 500, and 1,000 mM), with the optional addition
of 10 mM KCl. The proteins were dialyzed extensively
and prepared in a final concentration between 0.5 and
1.2 mg/mL. Before applying the sample, the instrument
(Malvern Microcal PEAK DSC) was thermally equili-
brated with corresponding buffer-buffer runs; scanning
range was set between 25 and 70
/C14C with a speed of
120 K/hr.
4.7 | Molecular dynamics simulations
and binding mode analysis
The PET6 crystal structure was prepared with the pro-
gram CHARMM,72 using the CHARMM3673,74 force field.
For the simulations we used chain A of the crystal struc-
ture and the corresponding water molecules. The muta-
tions for the PET6-VSTA structure were introduced with
PyMOL.
75 Disulfide bonds were set, and hydrogens were
added with the HBUILD routine in CHARMM. Proton-
ation probabilities were calculated using MEAD
76,77 and
GMCT.78 Two hundred equilibration scans and 100,000
production scans were performed at 323 K with 1.05 M
ionic strength and permittivity 4 for the protein and
80 for the solvent in the pH range 0–14 with steps of 0.25.
The protonation states of titratable groups were set
according to this calculation. For the MD simulations, we
used a PET tetramer as ligand applying published param-
eters.
79 The carboxyl ends of the ligand were modeled as
methyl esters to simulate a neutral continuation of longer
PET chains. The initial position of the ligand was mod-
eled according to the inhibitor p-nitrophenol bound in
the crystal structure with the PDB-ID 5XH2. Both protein
structures were superimposed and the second repeat unit
of the PET tetramer was superimposed with the phenyl
ring of p-nitrophenol. The prepared protein with ligand
was solved in a cubic box of water molecules extending at
least 25 Å from the protein ligand complex with an ion
concentration of 1.05 M NaCl. All MD simulations were
run with ACEMD
80 at 323.15 K. In total, we performed
20 independent production runs about 50 ns for each pro-
tein whereas we just considered trajectories where the
PET tetramer remained bound to the protein throughout
the trajectory and where a partially bound ligand did not
form self-stacking interactions. For PET6-wt 8 trajectories
fulfilled these criteria and for PET6-VSTA more than
8 trajectories fulfilled them. Thus, for both proteins, we
analyzed 8 independent production runs each 50 ns long.
The processing of the MD trajectories was performed
with MD analysis.
81,82 Errors of the calculated shares of
interactions were obtained by dividing each total trajec-
tory for PET6-wt and for PET6-VSTA into five consecu-
tive trajectories of equal size and calculating the standard
deviation of the respective shares among them. Binding
modes were obtained on the basis of the Tanimoto simi-
larity coefficient.
83 A coefficient of 1 means an identical
interaction pattern and a coefficient of 0 means no identi-
cal interactions. Similar interaction patterns among all
the structures in the trajectories can then be clustered.
For that, the analysis of interactions and the Tanimoto
interaction fingerprint analysis were performed with Pro-
LIF.
52 Clustering for the binding mode analysis was per-
formed with the kMeans algorithm of scikit-learn.84 The
optimal number of clusters was obtained by the Silhou-
ette score. As representative structure for each cluster the
closest structure to the cluster center was taken.
