Remarkably, a hydrolase from Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6, termed PETase, 
exhibits great potential in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste management 
due to it can efficiently degrade PET under moderate conditions. However, its 
low yield and poor accessibility to bulky substrates hamper its further industrial 
application. Herein a multigene fusion strategy is introduced for constructing a 
hydrophobic cell surface display (HCSD) system in Escherichia coli as a robust, 
recyclable, and sustainable whole-cell catalyst. The truncated outer membrane 
hybrid protein FadL exposed the PETase and hydrophobic protein HFBII on the 
surface of E. coli with efficient PET accessibility and degradation performance. 
E. coli containing the HCSD system changed the surface tension of the bacterial 
solution, resulting in a smaller contact angle (83.9 ± 2° vs. 58.5 ± 1°) of the system 
on the PET surface, thus giving a better opportunity for PETase to interact with 
PET. Furthermore, pretreatment of PET with HCSD showed rougher surfaces 
with greater hydrophilicity (water contact angle of 68.4 ± 1° vs. 106.1 ± 2°) than the 
non-pretreated ones. Moreover, the HCSD system showed excellent sustainable 
degradation performance for PET bottles with a higher degradation rate than free 
PETase. The HCSD degradation system also had excellent stability, maintaining 
73% of its initial activity after 7 days of incubation at 40 °C and retaining 70% 
activity after seven cycles. This study indicates that the HCSD system could 
be used as a novel catalyst for efficiently accelerating PET biodegradation.

Introduction
PET is a plastic material excessively used in beverage and food packaging and synthetic 
textile fibers (Geyer et al., 2017). The growing demand for PET requires a practical and 
comprehensive global manufacturing and waste management system to reduce the littering 
of natural systems and the usage of fossil resources. Currently, PET is mainly recycled by

mechanical recycling methods after intensive sorting. 
Subsequently, sufficient quality is assumed, and the products can 
be  reused in the established production processes. However, 
during melting and reprocessing, the chain length of the polymer 
is affected by shear forces and high temperatures, which can easily 
lead to thermal and mechanical degradation, thus changing the 
properties of the polymer and producing low-quality plastic (Kröll 
et al., 2021). A recent alternative to realize higher circularity is the 
chemical recycling of commodity polymers to monomers, which 
requires hazardous chemicals and conditions (Coates and Getzler, 
2020). Although industrial PET recovery processes have been 
established to reuse collected material and replace virgin 
feedstocks, a significant proportion of the global PET waste is 
incinerated, buried, or entered the environment due to 
improper treatment.
Furthermore, plastic waste, such as PET, may 
be  considered a potential source of carbon for industrial 
biotechnology because of its carbon-rich polymer 
characteristics. In 2016, Y oshida ( Y oshida et al., 2016 ) tested 
different bacteria isolated from a bottle recycling plant’s 
environmental samples (e.g., wastewater, sediment, activated 
sludge). It has been found that one of the isolates, Ideonella 
sakaiensis  201-F6 strain, can use the plastic polymer PET as 
a sole carbon source to produce PETase and MHETase 
enzymes at low temperatures. PETase showed higher 
specificity and degradation performance on commercial 
bottle-derived PET than other previously described 
hydrolases, like FsC from fungus Fusarium solani  (Martinez 
et  al., 1992 ), bacterial cutinases TfH from thermophilic 
actinomycete Thermobifida fusca  (Müller et al., 2005 ), LCC 
derived from leaf-branch compost metagenome ( Sulaiman 
et al., 2012 )) and so on. These two features make PETase a 
prospective candidate for the decomposition and recovery of 
PET at environmental temperature. However, there is an 
urgent demand to enhance further the performance of PETase 
in the decomposition of highly crystalline PET, which is a 
vital factor hindering its realization for industrial applications.
In industrial applications, immobilized enzymes are preferred 
to overcome the limited properties of free enzymes, such as 
stability and reusability ( Gennari et  al., 2021 ). Enzyme 
immobilization methods involve covalent binding to a specific 
carrier, cross-linking, and encapsulation. However, the chemicals 
involved in these techniques could denature the enzyme and lead 
to the loss of its activity. In addition, the process of enzyme 
production and purification is time-consuming, laborious, and 
costly. Recently, researchers developed a cell surface display 
system, which uses synthetic biology techniques to design 
regenerable whole-cell biocatalysts that convey target enzymes on 
the surface of alive microbial cells (Dwevedi and Kayastha, 2012). 
The basic principle of the cell surface display technique involves 
tethering the target protein to an anchor protein (typically an 
outer membrane protein (Gilbert et al., 2014), which is integrated 
into the host cells and then actively transferred to the cell surface 
through the host’s cellular secretory system. There have been 
abundant published studies on the surface display of lipase and 
cutinase (Lee et al., 2005a,b; Liu et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2021). 
PETase also had been displayed successfully using yeast as chassis 
cells (Chen et al., 2020). The structure predicted by Gaetano et al. 
(Cristalli et al., 2000) suggests that the outer membrane-bound 
fatty acid transporter (FadL) of E. coli is expected to be rich in β 
structures and it can cross the outer membrane multiple times to 
form fatty acid-specific channels. FadL has previously been 
successfully used as an anchor peptide for esterase display on the 
surface of E. coli (Lee et al., 2004).
Hydrophobins are small, cysteine-rich proteins produced by 
filamentous fungi. They can spontaneously self-assemble into 
amphipathic monolayers at hydrophobic or hydrophilic 
interfaces resulting in a reversal of the surface wettability 
(Linder et al., 2005; Ren et al., 2013). Doris (Ribitsch et al., 2013) 
enhanced the PET-hydrolyzing activity of a bacterial cutinase by 
fusion to fungal hydrophobins to improve PET-hydrolyzing 
activity. The hydrolytic activity of PETase at 30°C was increased 
by 51% by fusing with hydrophobin RolA extracted from 
Aspergillus oryzae  ( Puspitasari et  al., 2021 ). Kontkanen 
(Kontkanen et al., 2009 ) demonstrated a higher activity of a 
polyester hydrolase from Coprinopsis cinerea to cleave cutin and 
suberin in the presence of class II type of hydrophobin protein 
derived from Trichoderma reesei (HFBII) (Nakari-Setälä et al., 
1997; Hakanpää et al., 2006 ; Dai et al., 2021 ). These findings 
caused us to presume that HFBII can also stimulate the 
enzymatic modification of synthetic polymers like PET. In this 
study, we constructed a hydrophobic cell surface display system, 
herein called HCSD, on the surface of E. coli by fusing PETase 
with hydrophobin HFBII and FadL. The expression system 
allows E. coli to be used as an efficient and sustainable whole-cell 
catalyst for the industrial degradation of PET.
Materials and methods
Bacteria and reagents
Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) was incubated in LB medium 
supplemented with kanamycin (50 mg/ml) at 37°C in the shaker 
at 200 rpm unless otherwise specified. DNA polymerase, 
restriction enzymes, and the reagents used in cloning work were 
obtained from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA). The discarded 
PET drinking water bottles were cleaned by washing with double-
distilled water and sterilized with ethanol (75%, v/v) before being 
used. Escherichia coli TOP10 was used in recombinant DNA 
cloning and plasmid propagation. Escherichia coli TOP10 and 
Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) competent cells were provided by 
TransGen Biotech Co., LTD (China). Protein experiment-related 
supplies and reagents were purchased from Thermo Fisher 
Scientific (Guangzhou, China). The plasmid Extraction Kit was 
purchased from Takara Bio Inc., (Shiga, Japan). Other chemicals 
used in this work were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich Trading 
Co. Ltd. (Shanghai, China).

Construction of HCSD system
The vector used to construct the HCSD system (pET-30a (+): 
HCSD) was derived from PETase-containing plasmids constructed 
from PETase-only-containing plasmid pET-30a (+): PETase which 
was constructed in the previous study (Jia et al., 2021). The flexible 
linker (GGGGS)3, which can increase folding and stability and 
improve intrinsic biological activity (Chen et al., 2013), was used 
to connect the different domains. The gene encoding the PETase 
was cloned from this vector using the primer PETase-F (which 
contains (GGGGS)3-linker) and PETase-R. The fusion site on fadL 
was selected consistent with the previous reference to ensure the 
stability of PETase on the surface of E. coli (Lee et al., 2004). The 
FadL fragment was amplified by PCR from E. coli BL21 (DE3) 
using the primer FadL-F and FadL-R (which contains (GGGGS)3-
linker). Based on the published coding DNA sequence of hfbII 
from T. reesei,  the hfbII was fully synthesized after codon 
optimization conducted by GenScript Inc. (China). 
We additionally added a hexa-histidine tag C-terminally before 
the STOP codon using the primers HFBII-F and HFBII 
(Supplementary Table S1). The truncated fadL gene was cloned 
and linked to the PETase gene at the C-terminus, and the other 
end of the PETase was linked to the gene of hydrophobic protein. 
The Loop-opening vector fragment was generated using the 
primer P-F and its reverse complement P-R. Finally, the resulting 
large gene fragment was cloned into the plasmid fragment for 
expression using the Seamless Cloning and Assembly kit provided 
by TransGen Biotech Co., LTD (China) (the final sequences can 
be found in the Supplementary material). Based on the nucleotide 
sequence of HCSD, the molecular weight size of HCSD protein 
was calculated by the protein molecular weight prediction tool 
ProtParam tool to be about 81 kDa. The sequence of the resulting 
plasmids was confirmed using Sanger sequencing by 
SinoGenoMax Co., LTD (China). E. coli cells displaying PETase 
(CSD) or HFBII (HCSD-HFBII) alone were used as control 
groups. For HCSD-HFBII, the primers involved in connecting 
FadL and HFBII are HCSD-HFBIIF and HCSD-HFBIIR. The 
construction process of CSD is consistent with HCSD except that 
HFBII was not connected. Primers used in this work are listed in 
Supplementary Table S1.
Cultivation and induction conditions
After that, the expression plasmids, pET-30a (+): HCSD, 
pET-30a (+): CSD and pET-30a (+): HCSD-HFBII were 
transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) competent cells via heat 
shock. The successful transformation was confirmed via agarose 
gel electrophoresis and Sanger sequencing. 200 μl pre-cultures 
were inoculated from glycerol stocks and grown in a 10 ml LB 
medium overnight. After that, 1 ml pre-cultures were transferred 
to a 50 ml LB medium for expression. Cell growth of the cultures 
was measured using a HITACHI U-2910 spectrophotometer 
(Japan). After the cultures reached an OD600 of 3, induction was 
conducted at 18°C and 150 rpm using IPTG at final concentration 
of 0.6 mM. For the separation of free PETase, 50 ml culture 
medium was centrifuged for 5 min at 4°C. The collected E. coli 
cells were resuspended in 5 ml sodium phosphate (10 mM, pH 
7.4). After that, the resuspended cells were disrupted by an 
ultrasonic homogenizer at 4°C. And finally, the crude enzyme 
solution containing PETase was collected via centrifugation at 4°C 
for 30 min and applied to the degradation process of PET directly.
Characterization of the structure of 
HCSD system
Western blot
Outer membrane proteins were prepared according to the 
instructions of kits purchased from BestBio (Shanghai, China) 
(Item No. BB-3151). 10 μl whole-cell lysates or membrane fraction 
samples were loaded onto a 12% (wt/vol) SDS-PAGE. Western 
blot analysis was carried out following the standard procedure of 
Sambrook and Russell (2006) . Anti-his mouse monoclonal 
antibodies [TransGen Biotech Co., LTD (China)] at a dilution rate 
of 1:1000 and rabbit anti-rat IgG (H + L) HRP conjugated 
secondary antibodies at a dilution rate of 1:500 was used to 
conduct the immunodetection of the hexa-histidine in the HCSD 
system and free PETase. A lumino light-emitting ECL kit (Thermo 
Scientific, United States) was used for band detection.
Immunofluorescence microscopy and cell 
viability assays
For immunofluorescence microscopy assays, 2 ml of E. coli 
cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm (Centrifuge, 
5,452, Eppendorf, Germany) for 5 min at 4°C after induction at 
18°C for 24 h. The cell pellet was washed three times with 
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer (10 mM, pH 7.4) and 
resuspended in 300 μl PBS buffer supplemented with 1% (wt/vol) 
of bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution. Cells were incubated in 
1 ml of anti-his mouse monoclonal antibody at a dilution rate of 
1:300. After 4 h incubation at 4°C, cells were washed five times 
with PBS solution. The cell-antibody complex was then incubated 
overnight at 4 °C with 1 ml of second antibody, Alexa Fluor 
488-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG (TransGen Biotech), at a 
dilution rate of 1:300. After washing with PBS buffer thoroughly, 
the image of cells was observed with the super-resolution confocal 
microscope Leica SP8 STED 3X. Cell viability within the biofilm 
was examined using a Live/Dead BacLight kit ( Hympanova 
et al., 2020).
Enzyme activity assay
Tributyrin plate clearing assay
Tributyrin plate clearing assays were performed based on 
previously described studies (Filloux and Ramos, 2014). Briefly, 
30 ml of sterilized tributyrin emulsion, containing 50% (v/v) 
Jia et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.1005480
Frontiers in Microbiology 04 frontiersin.org
tributyrin and 50 g/l gum arabic in distilled water, was added to 
0.97 l of melted LB solid medium which contained 50 g/l 
kanamycin and 0.6 mM IPTG. The mixture was mixed thoroughly, 
cooled to 60°C, and then poured into Petri plates. The plates were 
left to solidify for 20 min under UV in the laminar flow cabinet, 
then inoculated with 1 μl of E. coli cells containing pET-30a (+): 
HCSD, pET-30a (+): CSD and pET-30a (+): HCSD-HFBII, 
respectively, and incubated at 18°C for 72 h. It should be noted 
that the preparation of tributyrin emulsion requires thorough 
mixing with a homogenizer (Eppendorf, Germany).
Degradation of 4-nitrophenyl butyrate ester 
with HCSD system
The E. coli cells containing plasmids pET-30a (+): HCSD, 
pET-30a (+): CSD and pET-30a (+): HCSD-HFBII (OD600 = 3, 
200 μl) were incubated with 3 ml of 4 mM 4-nitrophenyl butyrate 
ester (4-NPB) in 100 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) for 2 min at 
35°C. 4-NPB has been widely used as a model substrate to 
measure the activity of PETase (Qiao et al., 2022). The formation 
of p-nitrophenol (molar extinction coefficient = 16,600 M−1 cm−1 
(Ji et al., 2021)) was monitored at a wavelength of 400 nm via a 
spectrophotometer (HITACHI U-2910, Japan).
Reusability and stability assays of the HCSD 
whole-cell biocatalyst
After 48 h of induction using IPTG, 10 ml E. coli  cells 
containing plasmids pET-30a (+): HCSD and pET-30a (+): CSD 
were used to study the thermostability of HCSD and CSD systems, 
and unpurified crude PETase from 10 ml of cell culture was used 
as the control. After 7 days of incubation with 4 mM 4-NPB in 
50 mM glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 7.0) using a static incubator at 
40°C, the residual activity was measured every 24 h. The 
biocatalyst recycling was performed by collecting the E. coli cells 
which harbored plasmid pET-30a (+): HCSD and pET-30a (+): 
CSD using centrifugation at 3500 × g for 5 min. The activity was 
measured after washing the cells three times with 50 mM glycine-
NaOH (pH 7.0). The initial catalytic activity was defined as 100%. 
The experiments were conducted in triplicates and values 
represent the mean ± standard error.
Degradation of pet film and fed-batch culture
PET film from a conventional bottle (NONGFU SPRING, 2 l, 
specific polymer characteristics unspecified) was cut into small 
pieces of 0.015 g about 1 cm2 square in area and used in subsequent 
fed-batch experiment. After completing the induction for 48 h in 
2.3, the cell culture containing plasmids pET-30a (+): HCSD, 
pET-30a (+): CSD and pET-30a (+): HCSD-HFBII were incubated, 
respectively, with PET film in 30 ml of LB medium containing 
kanamycin (50 mg/ml), and 30 ml buffer containing of 50 mM 
Na2HPO4-HCl (pH 8.0) which was used for the degradation 
process of PETase. The method for PET degradation of PETase 
was consistent with the previous literature (Jia et al., 2021). The 
amount of free PETase produced by disrupting the E. coli cells 
with the same OD as the HCSD expression system at the induction 
time was used as a control. 30 ml LB medium was supplied to the 
degradation system of HCSD, and unpurified crude PETase from 
30 ml of cell culture was added to the degradation system of 
PETase on the fourth day of the degradation process. The TPA 
content in the product was sampled every 12 h during the 
degradation process.
Degradation product (TPA) measurement
As described before, degradation products were detected 
by measuring absorbance at 260 nm using a G1315D diode 
array detector with the aid of a C18 column mounted on an 
Agilent 1200 LC system ( Jia et al., 2021 ). Briefly, a mixture of 
0.1% (v/v) formic acid (A) and acetonitrile (B) was used as 
the mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.8 ml/min to separate the 
analytes of interest. The mobile phase B was changed 
gradually from 1 to 5% for 5 min, 5–44% for 7 min, and 
44–70% for 3 min, with a constant ratio of 95% for 10 min. 
The concentration of TPA, MHET and BHET was detected at 
a wavelength of 260 nm and quantified from the areas of the 
absorption peaks by standard curves.
SEM analysis
At the end of the PET film biodegradation period (7 days), the 
reactions were stopped by adding 5 ml of 3 M HCl. The PET pieces 
in the flasks were used for scanning electron microscopy (SEM) 
analysis by JSM-7800 (JEOL, Japan) after washing with 1% SDS, 
ultrapure water, and ethanol, respectively. In SEM analysis, 
samples were coated with Au for 180 s at 20 mA and were scanned 
under a low vacuum at 10 kV .
Contact angle measurement
Degraded PET samples were separated from the cell 
cultures containing plasmids pET-30a (+): HCSD, pET-30a (+): 
CSD, pET-30a (+): HCSD-HFBII  and empty plasmid pET-30a 
(+), incubated in 1% (w/v) SDS solution for 2 h, washed with 
deionized water, followed by sonication in 70% ethanol 
solution for 30 min, washed again with deionized water to 
remove any biofilm, and attached organics thoroughly, and 
finally dried naturally at room temperature. For contact angle 
measurements using Kruss DSA K100 (Kruss GmbH, 
Hamburg, Germany), 20 μl ultrapure water was added to the 
surface of PET, and the drop-shape images were recorded and 
analyzed using Drop Shape Analysis software (Kruss). For 
surface tension analysis of bacterial solution, 20 μl cell culture 
harboring pET-30a (+): HCSD, pET-30a (+): CSD and pET-30a 
(+): HCSD-HFBII  with OD600 of 3 in LB medium was added to 
non-pretreated PET surface, and E. coli  culture without any 
expression plasmids was used as a negative control. 
Subsequently, the contact angle between the cell cultures and 
PET is detected as before. Three positions of each film were 
analyzed to increase the reliability of experimental results. The 
results were expressed as mean ± standard deviation.

Results and discussion
Construction of HCSD expression system
The HCSD expression system was constructed by performing 
multiple gene fusions on the expression plasmid, pET 30a (+).  
Supplementary Schematic 1 illustrates the sandwich structure of 
the degradation part of HCSD. The expression vectors for HCSD 
and CSD contained the robust T7 promoter and its downstream 
lac manipulator sequence, and required the use of IPTG for 
induction. The plasmid map of the HCSD expression system is 
shown in Supplementary Figure 1.
Characterization of the structure of the 
HCSD system
We demonstrated the successful construction of the HCSD 
system by Sanger sequencing. The membrane protein was 
extracted and confirmed by SDS-PAGE and western-blot analysis. 
Free PETase showed a molecular weight of only 30 kDa, and the 
fused protein in the HCSD system showed an approximate 
molecular weight of 81 kDa, which is consistent with the predicted 
result. The results indicated that the fusion protein is correctly 
expressed on the outer membrane of E. coli, as shown in Figure 1 
and Supplementary Figure  2. In addition, as the expression 
location of the fused protein in the HCSD system is located on the 
outer membrane of E. coli, the protein expression level is so low 
that it needs to be  induced at a higher cell concentration 
(OD600 = 3) and extracted from the membrane protein before it can 
be  detected using SDS-PAGE and Western blot 
(Supplementary Figure 2).
The fluorescence immunoassay was performed by selecting a 
monoclonal antibody against the his-tag as the first antibody. The 
fluorescence was only detected on the surface of E. coli containing 
the HCSD expression system, while no fluorescence was observed 
in E. coli (DE3) which displays PETase only, as shown in Figure 2. 
This image together with Supplementary Figure 2 confirms the 
expression of HCSD on the outer cell membrane of E. coli.
Characterization of enzyme activity and 
hydrophobicity of HCSD system
Halo assay was conducted to test the enzymatic activity of 
HCSD. Figure 3 indicates that expanding clear halos were formed 
in the plates with tributyrin as substrate in HCSD and CSD 
groups, and they became more significant with time. In contrast, 
the E. coli colony in the control group, which contains the HCSD-
HFBII expression system, neither grew well nor formed a clear 
halo since HFBII has no PETase activity. In addition, from the size 
of the clear halos, the HCSD expression system was higher in the 
enzyme activity with tributyrin as substrate, which indicated the 
presence of hydrophobic proteins contributes to the enzymatic 
activity. This is consistent with the predicted results and can 
be explained by the fact that the presence of hydrophobic proteins 
facilitates the binding of the enzyme and the substrate, thus 
promoting the hydrolysis of the substrate (Puspitasari et al., 2021).
It is well known that the degradation of PETase on PET changes 
the hydrophobic properties of the PET surface by exposing the 
hydrophilic groups (-OH and-COOH) due to the breakage of ester 
bonds in the molecular chains of PET (Giovambattista et al., 2007), 
and the changes can be monitored by measuring the contact angle 
with water. Contact angle measurements were conducted on E. coli 
digested PET samples, as shown in Figure 4. The water contact 
angle of non-pretreated PET was 106.1 ± 2°, while the contact angle 
was 68.4 ± 1° after treatment with E. coli containing the HCSD 
system. This indicated that the HCSD system significantly altered 
the hydrophobicity of PET due to the enzymatic digestion of 
PETase, which was exposed to the surface of E. coli. The PETase in 
CSD showed some capability of degradation (86.0 ± 1°), but less 
than HCSD system, which due to the self-assembly of HFBII would

form an amphipathic layer on the PET surface, creating a 
hydrophilic surface that targets the PETase enzyme to the PET film. 
Moreover, PET treated with HCSD-HFBII showed a comparable 
contact angle (104.6 ± 1°) to the control group, indicating that 
HFBII itself did not have any degradation effect on PET, but it only 
enhanced the hydrolysis of PET by PETase.

The difference in contact angle with PET was measured between 
the HCSD, CSD and HCSD-HFBII expression systems for the same 
concentration of the E. coli solution. Figure 5 shows that the contact 
angle with PET was smaller for the bacterial solution containing the 
HCSD and HCSD-HFBII systems (58.5 ± 1° vs. 51.3 ± 2°), which 
could be attributed to the difference in the surface tension of the 
droplets. This difference in surface tension is due to the diverse 
hydrophilic and hydrophobic properties of the bacterial surface 
caused by the self-assembly of the HFBII (Wösten and de Vocht, 
2000). Additionally, the bacterial solution containing the CSD 
system has a relative surface tension to the negative control group 
(81.6 ± 3° vs. 83.9 ± 2°), suggesting that the difference in surface 
tension is caused exclusively by the hydrophobic protein HFBII.
The E. coli containing the HCSD, CSD and HCSD-HFBII 
expression system were co-incubated with PET film, and electron 
microscopic analysis showed that the PET film incubated with 
HCSD showed more significant grooves and holes compared to 
the E. coli  (DE3) containing and CSD expression system 
(Figure 6). The cell surface display system displayed HFBII did not 
show any degradation effect. These results further illustrated that 
the hydrophobic protein HFBII can contribute to better 
degradation of PETase within the cell display system which could 
be  illustrated that HFBII can colonize the PET surface and 
maintain high cell viability in biofilm (Supplementary Figure 3), 
thus resulting in better contact and act on PET (Huang et al., 2022).
The catalyst cost should be  considered. The stability and 
reusability of the catalyst are crucial to reducing the catalyst cost 
before the constructed whole-cell catalysts are applied for industrial 
applications. Therefore, the sustainability of enzyme activity at 40°C 
and the recyclable times of the HCSD system were investigated. The 
thermostability of the HCSD whole-cell biocatalyst and free PETase 
at 40°C was evaluated as shown in Figure 7A. The activity of free 
PETase decreased rapidly with time, with only 65% of its initial 
activity and a complete loss of activity by the 3rd day, but the HCSD 
and CSD systems showed only a slight loss of activity, with residual 
activity remaining above 70% after the 7th day. Technically, the E. coli 
whole-cell catalyst recovery can be achieved simply by centrifugation. 
However, the uncertainty of the recovery process lies in whether the 
displayed PETase can continuously maintain its biological activity 
during this process. We measured the residual activity of the PETase 
in the HCSD and CSD systems during each cycle (Figure 7B). Overall, 
the result showed a low loss of PETase during the recycling process, 
which maintained 70% of its activity for seven cycling rounds, 
indicating that PETase has strong stability in the cell surface display 
systems. The reusability and sustainability of the whole-cell 
biocatalysts not only overcome the difficulty of recovering PETase

from the reaction system without a complex and expensive 
purification process, but also make it suitable for the development of 
time-saving and profitable biocatalyst processes.
Samples were collected at different time intervals during the 
degradation process of 7 days, and the concentration of TPA was 
measured to confirm the effect of the HCSD system on PET 
degradation. As shown in Figure 8, when PET is degraded directly 
with free PETase, the reaction rate is faster than HCSD and CSD 
systems for some time in the beginning, and the amount of TPA 
released is three times higher than that of the HCSD degradation 
system on the 1st day. This is probably because the two expression 
systems involve the expression of membrane proteins, which are 
usually much lower than intracellular expression systems. Moreover, 
it costs some time to induce the expression of a sufficient amount of 
PETase in both HCSD and CSD systems. Surprisingly, when the 
degradation rate of the free PETase decreased with time, the activity 
of PETase within the HCSD system remained stable due to the 
enzyme was immobilized on the supporting cells. Furthermore, the 
higher hydrophilicity of the HCSD system resulted in a higher 
chance of microbial colonization and subsequent biodegradation. 
On the 4th day, the HCSD system was supplemented with an equal 
volume of LB medium, while the control group was supplemented 
with the same amount of PETase as at the beginning of the reaction. 
It can be  seen that the degradation rate of the HCSD gradually 
increased due to bacterial growth after supplementation of the 
medium. In contrast, the degradation rate of the supplemented 
enzyme group was decreased until PETase was inactivated after only 
a short period of increase. In the long-term degradation process of 
7 days, the HCSD expression system produced 52% more 
degradation products than the group where PET is degraded directly 
with free PETase due to the presence of hydrophobic proteins, which 
increase the affinity of PET and PETase.
Conclusion
In summary, we have developed, for the first time, a whole-cell 
biocatalysis strategy based on the immobilization of PETase and 
coupling with hydrophobic protein on the surface of E. coli cells. 
We found that PETase could be displayed with functionality on 
the surface of E. coli. Furthermore, the whole-cell biocatalysts

containing HCSD could be  reused several times and achieve 
continuous degradation of PET without significant activity loss. 
Based on our research, more whole-cell biocatalysts containing 
HCSD expression systems can be developed and optimized in 
terms of enzyme type, linkers and anchor motifs selection in the 
future. This technology has a broad application prospect for the 
industrial degradation of PET waste plastics as it avoids the 
expensive enzyme separation and purification process.
