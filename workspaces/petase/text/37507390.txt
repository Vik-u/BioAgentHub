Excessive polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste causes a variety of problems.
Extensive research focused on the development of superior PET hydrolases for
PET biorecycling has been conducted. However, template enzymes employed
in enzyme engineering mainly focused onIsPETase and leaf-branch compost
cutinase, which exhibit mesophilic and thermophilic hydrolytic properties,
respectively. Herein, we report a PET hydrolase fromCryptosporangium aur-
antiacum (CaPETase) that exhibits high thermostability and remarkable PET
degradation activity at ambient tempera t u r e s .W eu n c o v e rt h ec r y s t a ls t r u c -
ture ofCaPETase, which displays a distinct backbone conformation at the
active site and residues forming the substrate binding cleft, compared with
other PET hydrolases. We further develop aCaPETase
M9 variant that exhibits
robust thermostability with aTm of 83.2 °C and 41.7-fold enhanced PET
hydrolytic activity at 60 °C compared withCaPETaseWT. CaPETaseM9 almost
completely decompose both transparent and colored post-consumer PET
powder at 55 °C within half a day in a pH-stat bioreactor.
Plastics are synthetic polymers, with advantages of chemical resis-
tance, light weight, and low cost. They have been extensively used
worldwide since the 1950s and have become essential in our daily
lives
1,2. However, because plastics do not naturally decompose, billions
of tons of plastic waste in landﬁlls, ﬂoating in waste islands in the
ocean, and dispersed as microplastics have led to severe global
pollution
3–7. Governments and plastic manufacturers around the world
are aware of these issues, and research and development focused on
chemical and biological recycling strategies for plastic waste have
accelerated in recent years
8–10.
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a polyester composed of units
of terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol, is a widely used plastic
packaging material and is relatively easy to recycle. Studies on the
biological degradation of PET have been actively conducted in the last
two decades
8,11–13. PET biorecycling technology includes hydrolysis of
PET by microorganisms or enzymes and its conversion into high-value-
added chemicals, which ultimately establishes a circular economy for
PET11,14–16.
To date, various enzymes capable of hydrolyzing PET have been
discovered and characterized biochemically and structurally. In parti-
cular, PETase fromIdeonella sakaiensis201-F6 (IsPETase) exhibits the
highest PET hydrolytic activity at ambient temperatures and is con-
sidered a promising enzyme for PET waste treatment
17. Accordingly,
various enzyme engineering studies are currently underway to
improve the PET hydrolysis efﬁciency and thermal stability ofIsPETase,
and variants with improved performance have been reported
18–24.
Recently, metagenome-derived leaf-branch compost cutinase (LCC),
which exhibits thermophilic properties, has been discovered

PHL734 have been reported. And recently, thermotolerant PET hydro-
lases were discovered by genome mining in bioinformatics35.
For feasible application of enzymatic PET hydrolysis, the inher-
ently high catalytic activity of PET hydrolases is crucial factor as a
starting point. Also, exploiting the thermophilic PET hydrolase prop-
erties is also an efﬁcient strategy for development of superior PET
hydrolases, because high-temperature operation near the glass tran-
sition temperature of PET material is favorable to the PET degradation
performance
36. Thus, the discovery of promising PET-degrading
enzymes that have both high catalytic activity and high thermo-
stability properties is strongly needed to provide insight into the cat-
alysis reaction and expand the scope of efﬁcient PET biocatalysts.
There is a rapid progress in research on developing efﬁcient PET-
degrading enzymes, and numerous variants have emerged. None-
theless, recently developed PET hydrolases do not outperform the
previously reported enzymes in terms of enzymatic catalysis and
thermostability. Thus, template enzymes used for enzyme engineering
are mainly focused onIsPETase and LCC, which have mesophilic and
thermophilic hydrolytic properties, respectively. In the present study,
we report a PET hydrolase from Cryptosporangium aurantiacum
(CaPETase) that exhibits remarkable PET degradation activity at
ambient temperatures and high thermostability. The crystal structure
of CaPETase indicates that the enzyme has a unique active site com-
pared with other known PET hydrolases. Through structure-guided
rational protein engineering, we developed a robustCaPETase variant
that exhibits markedly enhanced enzyme activity and thermostability.
The applicability of this variant in the recycling industry was further
demonstrated by evaluating its activity with a pH-stat bioreactor.
Results
Discovery of aCaPETase with high PET hydrolytic activity and
thermostability
To discover a PET hydrolase, we performed a sequence homology
analysis using the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) database and selected 10 PETase candidates (see“Methods” for
details). A phylogenetic tree was constructed for the 10 selected
PETase candidates and 17 reported PET hydrolases. The 27 enzymes
were divided into two groups: one group contained mesophilic
enzymes, such asIsPETase, and the other group contained thermo-
philic enzymes, such asTfCut2 and LCC (Fig.1a, Supplementary Fig. 1
and Supplementary Table 1). The phylogenetic tree was further sepa-
rated into 10 subgroups, and 3 selected PETase candidates, namely,
RZL00883.1, KOX11336.1, and SHM40309.1, formed discrete lineages
with low phylogenetic relationships to the reported PET hydrolases
(Fig. 1a). To characterize the 10 selected PETase candidates (PCs), we
ﬁrst attempted to produce them in a signal peptide-truncated form.
Eight of the 10 PETase candidates were successfully produced, except
for KOX11336.1 and MAM88718.1. We also measured the melting tem-
perature (T
m) of the eight PETase candidates to determine the ther-
mostability of these enzymes. The candidates exhibited a range ofTm
values from 38.6 °C to 70.5 °C (Fig.1b and Supplementary Fig. 2). We
then checked PET hydrolytic activity of the eight PETase candidates at
a wide range of temperatures from 30 to 60 °C using several PET
samples, such as post-consumer transparent PET powder (PC-
PET
Transparent), semi-crystalline PET powder (Cry-PET, Goodfellow Cam-
bridge Ltd) (Cat. No. ES306000), and amorphous PETﬁlm (AF-PET,
Goodfellow Cambridge Ltd) (Cat. No. ES301445). Among these candi-
dates, PC3, PC7, PC8 and PC10 showed relatively low or undetectable
levels of PET hydrolytic activity across the tested conditions (Fig.1c
and Supplementary Fig. 3). PC6, which have the highestT
m value of
70.5 °C, produced only negligible amounts of PET hydrolysis products
at 30 °C, but showed the optimal PET hydrolytic activity at 50 °C
(Fig.1b, c and Supplementary Figs. 2, 3). PC4 and PC5 showed relatively
high PET hydrolytic activity at 50 °C and 40 °C, respectively (Fig.1ca n d
Supplementary Fig. 3). Surprisingly, compared to other PETase can-
didates, PC2 exhibited signiﬁcantly high PET hydrolytic activity across
a broad range of reaction conditions. Notably, PC2 exhibited superior
activity at 30 °C and produced the highest amount of PET hydrolysis
products across all three PET substrates conditions compared to other
candidates. (Fig.1c and Supplementary Fig. 3). In addition, the pH
proﬁle results for the eight PETase candidates also showed that
PC2 showed the highest level of PET hydrolytic activity (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 4). It is noteworthy that PC2 showed remarkable PET hydro-
lytic activity compared with the other enzymes, and also exhibited
high thermostability with aT
m value of 66.8 °C (Fig.1b, c and Sup-
plementary Fig. 2). Moreover, PC2 had the highest soluble expression
level compared with the other enzymes (Fig.1b). These results indicate
that PC2 has excellent properties for efﬁcient PET degradation,
including enzyme activity, thermostability, and protein expression
levels. Thus, we selected PC2 (accession code:SHM40309.1,P E T a s e
from Cryptosporangium aurantiacum, CaPETase) as the most robust
PET hydrolase among the eight PETase candidates tested. The mea-
surements of changes of theT
m value and activity by addition of metal
ions showed that PC2 is not a metal ion-dependent enzyme (Supple-
mentary Fig. 5).
Next, we compared the PET hydrolytic activity ofCaPETase with
that of well-known PET hydrolases, such asIsPETase,TfCut2, and LCC,
over a broad temperature range from 30 to 60 °C using Cry-PET as a
substrate. In reactions at 30 °C,CaPETase showed signiﬁcantly higher
PET hydrolytic activity than LCC andTfCut2 (Fig.1d and Supplemen-
tary Fig. 3). Moreover,CaPETase exhibited 1.4-fold higher activity than
IsPETase, which is known to have the highest PET hydrolytic activity at
ambient temperature among the reported PET hydrolases (Fig.1d)
17.I n
particular, the PET hydrolytic activity ofCaPETase was 3.1-fold higher
than that ofIsPETase at 40 °C (Fig.1d), likely becauseCaPETase has
much higher thermostability thanIsPETase. However, the PET hydro-
lytic activity ofCaPETase at 60 °C dramatically decreased and reversed
compared with that of LCC at temperatures of 50 °C and 60 °C
(Fig. 1d). These results indicate thatCaPETase is a promising PET
hydrolase that exhibits high PET decomposition ability and thermo-
stability. Considering that it is important to make improvements
without the loss of enzyme activity and thermostability in the devel-
opment of superior PET-degrading enzymes
37,w ep r o p o s et h a tCaPE-
Tase represents a more ef ﬁcient template enzyme for enzyme
engineering than other enzymes with extreme mesophilic and ther-
mophilic properties, such asIsPETase and LCC, respectively.
Unique structural features ofCaPETase
To provide a structural basis for high PET hydrolytic activity ofCaPE-
Tase, we determined its crystal structure at a resolution of 1.36 Å
(Supplementary Table 2).CaPETase shows anα/β hydrolase fold and a
nine-stranded β-sheet at the center surrounded by sixα-helices and
two 310-helices (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 6). Sequence-
independent pairwise superposition of CaPETase with three dis-
tinctive PET hydrolases, namely,IsPETase, LCC, andTfCut2, generated
global root mean square deviation values of 0.69, 0.65, and 0.53 Å,
respectively. Formation of one conserved disulﬁde bond (DS, C279/
C297) and lack of an extended loop in the substrate binding site of
CaPETase suggest that the enzyme originated from an ancestor of
TfCut2 and LCC rather thanIsPETase (Supplementary Fig. 7). Inter-
estingly, CaPETase exhibits a somewhat different backbone structure
at the active site compared with other PET hydrolases (Supplementary
Fig. 8). Because the structural comparison using a Cartesian coordi-
nate system is known to be subjective for distinguishing the detailed
structural differences of the main chains
38, we further analyzed theφ-ψ
torsion angles of the main chains of these four PETases

(Supplementary Fig. 9) and found that there were local differences in
backbone torsion angles betweenCaPETase and other PET hydrolases
(Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 10). Interestingly,CaPETase also
showed signiﬁcant differences in the backbone torsion angles at the
ﬁve connecting loops (β3–α1, β4–α2, β6–β7, β7–α4, andβ8–α5) that
form an active site, whereas comparisons of the corresponding loops
between the other three PET hydrolases exhibited less differences
(Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. 11), suggesting thatCaPETase has a
unique active site conformation. There were some differences in the
network of residues extending from the active site to the nearby spatial
environment compared with that of the other PET hydrolases. Among
them, we observed unique differences affecting the backbone torsion
angles of these loops. Near theβ3–α1 loop, distinct residues posi-
tioned in theβ4–α2l o o pa n daW 1 0 5–L108–G124 network force, which
form a unique side-chain internal network, appear to inﬂuence the
conformation of theβ3–α1 loop (Supplementary Fig. 12). In fact, the
β3–α1 loop has high root mean squareﬂuctuation values near the
active sites of other PET hydrolases in molecular dynamic
simulations
39,40. A unique A192–G212–F248 network is formed under
the β8–α5 loop, where catalytic H246 is located (Supplementary
Fig. 13). At the corresponding F248 position inCaPETase, LCC and
TfCut2 have an alanine residue, whereasIsPETase has a cysteine resi-
due that forms a second disulﬁde bond. Therefore, the positioning of a
bulky F248 might cause signiﬁcant torsional differences in theβ8–α5

the highest and lowestﬂexibility among the four homologs, respec-
tively (Fig.2b). To our interest, the differences of the backboneﬂuc-
tuation proﬁle was localized exactly to the unique internal network
affecting the backbone torsion angles of these loops. Thus, we believe
that the unique backbone conformation of CaPETase allows the
enzyme to maintain high activity while stabilizing severalﬂexible loops
of the mesophilic PET hydrolase.
In addition to the unique backbone conformation at the active
site, residues forming the substrate binding cleft ofCaPETase showed
signiﬁcant differences compared with other thermophilic PET hydro-
lases (Fig.2c, d). In the vicinity of the wobbling W194,CaPETase pos-
sesses unique G196 and L133 residues, where highly conserved
residues are located in other PET hydrolases (Fig.2c, d and Supple-
mentary Fig. 7). Mutating these residues to the corresponding residues
in other PET hydrolases, such as G196L, L133Y, and L133Q, had a
negative effect on enzyme activity and/or thermostability (Fig.2e).
However, the G196T mutation exhibited enhanced thermostability
(Fig. 2e), which may result from the formation of a hydrogen bond
between G196T and N195.CaPETase also contains a unique I102 resi-
d u ei nt h eβ3–α1 loop showing the largest torsion differences, whereas
other PET hydrolases contain a highly conserved threonine residue at
the corresponding position, which probably enablesCaPETase to form
a relatively wider substrate binding cleft (Fig.2c, d and Supplementary
Fig. 16). Replacement of I102 with threonine resulted in decreased
enzyme activity, conﬁrming that the residue contributes to high
enzyme activity (Fig.2e). Furthermore,CaPETase has unique residues,
such as Q107, W168, and T250, at the regions of theβ3–α1l o o p ,β8–α5
loop, andα3, whereas most of the corresponding residues are highly
conserved in other thermophilic PET hydrolases (Fig.2c, d and Sup-
plementary Fig. 7). Mutating these residues to the conserved residues
in other thermophilic PET hydrolases decreased enzymatic activity
and/or stability, indicating that the combined positioning of these
residues is necessary to create an optimal substrate binding site for
CaPETase with a unique shape and polarity (Fig.2e). One exception
was the Q107S mutation, which resulted in no noticeable differences in
enzyme activity or thermostability (Fig.2e). Taken together, we sug-
gest that along with unique backbone torsion angles, the positioning
of distinct residues at the substrate binding site enableCaPETase to
form an optimal substrate binding site for high PET hydrolytic activity.
Rational protein engineering ofCaPETase
Although CaPETase has high PET hydrolytic activity and thermo-
stability, its performance is still insufﬁcient for industrial applications.
We conducted rational protein engineering ofCaPETase to further
enhance the PET hydrolytic activity and thermostability of the enzyme
using various strategies, such as introducing disulﬁde bonds and
hydrogen bonds and modifying the protein surface charge (Supple-
mentary Fig. 17). The thermostability of the variants was monitored by
measuring T
m values, and the PET hydrolytic activity of the variants
was measured using post-consumer transparent PET powder (PC-
PETTransparent) at ambient temperature (40 °C). We introduced four dis-
ulﬁde bonds, namely, G76C/A143C (DS1), L180C/A202C (DS2), T204C/
R233C (DS3), and R242C/S291C (DS4). The DS2 and DS4 mutations
increased theT
m value by approximately 3 °C, whereas the DS1 and
DS3 mutations decreased theTm value compared withCaPETaseWT
(Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 18). Moreover, the introduction of the
DS2 and DS4 mutations increased PET hydrolytic activity by more than
20% compared withCaPETase
WT (Fig. 3a and Supplementary Fig. 18).
These results indicate that the DS2 and DS4 mutations were success-
fully formed inCaPETase
WT and exerted positive effects on enzyme
activity and thermostability. We also attempted to improve the ther-
mostability ofCaPETase by introducing noncovalent bonds, such as
hydrogen bonds and salt bridges, and designed seven mutations,
namely, V129T (NC1), P136S (NC2), A192T (NC3), R198K (NC4), V203T
(NC5), A252N (NC6), and A257S(NC7). Of these, the NC1 and NC4
mutations increasedT
m values by approximately 2 °C and enhanced
PET hydrolytic activity by 30% compared withCaPETaseWT (Fig. 3aa n d
Supplementary Fig. 18). Finally, in an attempt to improve the protein
adsorption ability to the PET surface by modifying the protein surface
charge, we designedﬁve mutations to render the protein surface
hydrophobic, i.e., N109A (HP1), R151A (HP2), R157A (HP3), R160A
(HP4), and R233A (HP5), and four mutations to render the protein
surface positive, i.e., T86R (SC1), A155R (SC2), T275R (SC3), and M294R
(SC4). Unfortunately, most mutations did not show signiﬁcant changes
or even negative effects on thermostability or enzyme activity; how-
ever, the HP1 mutation increased theT

introduced eight point-mutations that resulted in improved thermo-
stability and PET hydrolytic activity, i.e., DS2, DS4, NC1, NC4, HP1, and
SC2, among the 20 rationally designed mutations tested (Fig.3aa n d
Supplementary Fig. 18). There were also ambiguous mutations that

37.
Combinatorial mutations ofCaPETase
We sequentially integrated the six mutations described above to
develop a superiorCaPETase variant with higher thermostability and
PET hydrolytic activity. First, we combined the DS2 and DS4 mutations,
and the resultingCaPETase
DS2/DS4 variant showed a synergistic effect on
thermostability with aTm value of 74.3 °C (ΔTm = 7.4 °C) (Fig.3ba n d
Supplementary Fig. 19). Moreover, the variant enhanced PET hydro-
lytic activity by 1.35- and 4.45-fold at 40 °C and 60 °C, respectively,
compared withCaPETase
WT (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 19). Next,
we set upCaPETaseDS2/DS4 as a scaffold for the next combination. We
integrated the NC1/NC4, HP1, and SC2 mutations individually into
CaPETase
DS2/DS4 using our engineering strategy. The addition of the
NC1/NC4 mutation increased theTm value signiﬁcantly by 3.9 °C and
increased PET hydrolytic activity at both 40 °C and 60 °C (Fig.3ba n d
Supplementary Fig. 19). It showed 3.8- and 17-fold enhanced activity at
60 °C compared withCaPETase
DS2/DS4 and CaPETaseWT, respectively
(Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 19). The addition of the HP1 mutation
increased theTm value by 2.7 °C and enhanced PET hydrolytic activity
by 1.7-fold at 60 °C compared withCaPETaseDS2/DS4 (Fig. 3ba n dS u p -
plementary Fig. 19). When the SC2 mutation was integrated into the
CaPETase
DS2/DS4 variant, we observed no noticeable improvements in
activity and thermostability; however, there was a slight increase in
PET hydrolytic activity at 60 °C (Fig.3b and Supplementary Fig. 19).

These results suggest that all four mutations (NC1, NC4, HP1, and
SC2) had a positive effect on the thermostability and activity of
CaPETase
DS2/DS4; thus, we combined the four mutations into
CaPETaseDS2/DS4 to generateCaPETaseDS2/DS4/NC1/NC4/HP1/SC2 (CaPETaseM8).
Surprisingly, when all four mutations were added toCaPETaseDS2/DS4,a
synergistic effect on thermostability and enzyme activity was
observed, andCaPETase
M8 exhibited signiﬁcantly enhanced thermo-
stability with aTm value of 80.7 °C and 1.5- and 25.8-fold enhanced PET
hydrolytic activity at 40 °C and 60 °C, respectively, compared with
CaPETase
WT (Fig. 3b and Supplementary Fig. 19).
As mentioned above, the G196T mutation resulted in positive
effects on both thermostability and enzyme activity (Fig.2e); thus, we
ﬁnally generated CaPETaseDS2/DS4/NC1/NC4/HP1/SC2/G196T (CaPETaseM9)b y
integrating the G196T mutation intoCaPETaseM8. CaPETaseM9 exhib-
ited aTm value of 83.2 °C, which corresponds to a 16.7 °C increase inTm
compared withCaPETaseWT. Moreover, the PET hydrolytic activity of
CaPETaseM9 increased by 1.7- and 31.2-fold at 40 °C and 60 °C,
respectively, compared withCaPETaseWT (Fig. 3b and Supplementary
Fig. 19). These results indicate a positive effect of G196T on
CaPETase
WT was applied similarly toCaPETaseM8.
CaPETaseM9 showed much higher activity at all temperature con-
ditions from 30 to 70 °C, and particularly, showed 41.7-fold higher
speciﬁc activity at 60 °C thanCaPETase
WT (Supplementary Fig. 20). The
result was also reproduced in a scale-up system of 50-mL shakingﬂasks
(Supplementary Fig. 21). These results demonstrated the improved
enzyme activity and reinforced thermostability ofCaPETase
M9.T h e
improved thermostability of the variant was further veriﬁed through
heat inactivation experiments, where CaPETaseM9 maintained its
activity even after incubation at 60 °C for 12 h, whereasCaPETaseWT
showed complete loss of activity within an hour (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 22).
We then compared the PET hydrolytic activity ofCaPETaseM9 with
LCCICCG towards PC-PET and Cry-PET at temperatures ranging from 30
to 60 °C. CaPETaseM9 showed signiﬁcantly higher PET hydrolytic
activity compared to LCCICCG,a t3 0° Ca n d4 0° C( F i g .3c). At 50 °C and
60 °C, CaPETaseM9 showed quite similar activity compared with
LCCICCG (Fig. 3c).
Structural insights into the enhanced PET degrading capacity of
CaPETaseM9
To provide structural insights into the enhanced PET-degrading
capacity of CaPETaseM9, we determined its crystal structure at a
resolution of 1.53 Å (Fig.4 and Supplementary Table 2). The forma-
tion of the introduced DS2 and DS4 disulﬁde bonds was clearly
observed in CaPETaseM9, and the S–S interatomic length of both
disulﬁde bonds was within the optimal disulﬁde bond length range
(Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 23). Interestingly, DS4 was located in
the vicinity of one of the calcium binding sites of Cut190 and the
mutation point ofIsPETase R280A42,43, and the formation of DS4 also
caused signiﬁcant changes in the surface electrostatic potential and
neighboring region conformation (Fig.4 and Supplementary Figs. 23
and 24). The side chain of the mutated V129T wasﬂipped to form a
hydrogen bond with the adjacent T131 and D132 residues, thereby
further stabilizing theβ4–α3 connecting loop (Fig.4 and Supple-
mentary Figs. 23 and 25). With respect to R198K, the mutated lysine
residue moved inward to form hydrogen bonds with the main chains
of N195 and D222, thereby stabilizing the wobbly tryptophan-
containing loop (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. 23). The mutated
G196T formed a water-mediated hydrogen bond with the adjacent
N195 residue, resulting in further stabilization of the wobbly
tryptophan-containing loop (Fig.4 and Supplementary Fig. 23). The
A155R mutation changed the hydrophobic surface to a positive
charge, which seems to increase the attachment of the enzyme to
the PET surface, as suggested by a previous report (Fig.4 and Sup-
plementary Fig. 23)
44. Finally, the N109A mutation appeared to
strengthen internal hydrophobic interactions (Fig.4 and Supple-
mentary Figs. 23 and 26).
Evaluation ofCaPETaseM9 in a pH-stat bioreactor
To evaluate the industrial applicability ofCaPETaseM9, we conducted a
PET decomposition experiment in a pH-stat bioreactor using PC-
PET
Transparent as a substrate (Supplementary Fig. 27). The bioreactor was
operated at 55 °C using 2.70 mgenzyme ∙ gPET
−1,a n dt h ep Hw a sc o n -
tinuously titrated at 8.0 by adding NaOH. The decomposition rate was
measured by monitoring released amounts of MHET and TPA. After a
short lag phase of an hour, which was required for initial hydro-
philization, the PET degradation rate increased exponentially, and 50%
of PC-PET
Transparent was depolymerized within 4 h (Fig.5a). In the second
half of the reaction, the degradation rate slightly decreased because of
a decrease in the amount of substrate; however, aﬁnal degradation
rate of 94.1% was achieved after 12 h (Fig.5a). This was a signiﬁcant
result in terms of showing that a high depolymerization rate of 90% or
more could be achieved even at 55 °C, which is a temperature condi-
tion relatively lower than theT
g temperature. This result also indicated
that CaPETaseM9 has signiﬁcant PET hydrolytic activity and thermo-
stability comparable to other benchmark biocatalysts. We also per-
formed decomposition of a post-consumer colored PET powder (PC-
PET
Colored), which is known to be relatively difﬁcult to recycle because of
the presence of colors, additives, multilayer structure, labels and other
complexities
45. Interestingly, the depolymerization rate of PC-PETColored
was almost identical to that of PC-PETTransparent, showing 50% depoly-
merization within 4 h (Fig.5b); however, theﬁnal depolymerization
rate of PC-PETColored was 89.2% at 12 h, which was slightly lower than
that of PC-PETTransparent (Fig. 5b). This is probably due to the impurities
present in PC-PETColored. These results demonstrate that unlike other
recycling methods, biorecycling of PET plastic can be achieved
regardless of the color of PET plastic.
Finally, we determined whether untreated post-consumer PET
containers can be depolymerized byCaPETase
M9. As depolymerization
proceeded, the PETﬁlm became opaque and thin, and the PETﬁlm
disappeared completely in 3 days (Fig.5c). These results suggest that
CaPETaseM9 can be utilized for decomposing PET plastics with various
physical properties.
Discussion
As plastic waste is emerging as an environmental issue, research on
enzymatic PET depolymerization for plastic waste is expanding as a
sustainable alternative for plastic waste treatment and recycling.
Therefore, research focused on the discovery of promising PET-
degrading enzymes has been actively conducted, and to date, more
than 20 PET-degrading enzymes have been biochemically identiﬁed
and characterized
46,47. Moreover, studies on developing robust PET-
degrading enzymes through various engineering strategies, such as
rational designing, directed evolution, and computation-guided
approaches, have been conducted. Although reports on the develop-
ment of efﬁcient PET-degrading enzyme variants are rapidly increas-
ing, the target enzymes for the development of superior variants are
focused on a few PET hydrolases, such asIsPETase and LCC, which have
excellent catalytic and thermostability properties, respectively. In this
work, we reported a PET-degrading enzyme,CaPETase, with both
mesophilic and thermophilic PET hydrolase properties; It exhibits
higher activity thanIsPETase under the ambient conditions and has a
T
m value of 66.8 °C. A positioning of serine for tryptophan wobbling
and an extended loop for enzyme-substrate access were proposed as
key structural features ofIsPETase for its high activity at ambient
temperature
21,22,48. AlthoughCaPETase shows high activity at ambient
temperature, the enzyme does not share these structural features of
mesophilic PET hydrolase (Supplementary Fig. 7). Moreover, its
backbone ﬂuctuation proﬁle showed that overall ﬂexibility at the
active site is lower than that ofIsPETase (Fig.2b), suggesting that it has

high activity at ambient conditions through a structural feature dif-
ferent from that ofIsPETase. Structural analysis ofCaPETase with three
representative PET-degrading enzymes, such asIsPETase, TfCut2, and
LCC, showed that CaPETase has unique backbone torsions of the
active site loops caused by three major internal networking differ-
ences. One of the distinct internal networks is located under theβ8–α5
loop (Supplementary Fig. 13). It is noteworthy to note that the unique
disulﬁde bond ofIsPETase corresponds to this region and that repla-
cements of the two cysteine residues with alanine severely decrease its
BHET and PET hydrolytic activity
22. Compared with LCC andTfCut2
having a A-A-T network,CaPETase has a unique G212-F248-A192 net-
work having the bulky hydrophobic side chain‘anchoring’ to the core
region (Supplementary Fig. 13). Presumably, the anchoring phenyla-
lanine in the network allowedCaPETase to maintain lower perturba-
tion of the catalytic H246 position in the front region ofβ8–α5l o o p ,
although the enzyme shows a relatively higher backboneﬂuctuation at
the middle region of theβ8–α5l o o p( F i g .2b, c). The middle region of
the β8–α5 loop inCaPETase contains a unique T250 residue, which
interacts with W168 and theβ3–α1l o o p( F i g .2b, c). Formation of this
unique environment extends to the unique W105-L108-G124 network
at the interface betweenβ3–α1a n dβ4–α2 loops (Supplementary
Fig. 12). The R176-W200-F209 network ofβ6–β7 loop is also note-
worthy, as this region has been reported to be important for the
activity of mesophilic enzymes
41,42,48. Taken together, the unique
structural features and backbone dynamics proﬁle ofCaPETase seem
to contribute to its stability and high activity at the same time.
Through the rational design ofCaPETase, combinatorial scaffold
engineering was performed to increase thermal stability and catalytic
efﬁciency of enzyme, and as a result, considerable improvement was
carried out at the T
m value (ΔTm = 16.7 °C) and catalytic efﬁcacy
(increased by 41.7-folds). As part of further efforts to assess the capa-
city ofCaPETase
M9, comparisons with benchmark enzyme and pH-stat
bioreactor operation elucidated thatCaPETaseM9 has sufﬁcient PET
decomposition performance for industrial applications. Thus, through
structure-guided rational protein engineering ofCaPETase, we devel-
oped CaPETase
M9 with dramatically enhanced PET hydrolytic activity
and thermostability and demonstrated that this variant has sufﬁcient
PET depolymerization ability for industrial applications. Our engi-
neering strategy could provide insights for the improvement of cata-
lytic activity and thermostability for other enzymes along with the
rational design used in this study. The emergence of aCaPETase having
both mesophilic and thermophilic PET hydrolase properties will
broaden the spectrum of enzyme for enzyme engineering and accel-
erate the implementation of biological recycling of PET.
Methods
Preparation of PET samples
Post-consumer transparent PET powder (PC-PETTransparent)a n dp o s t -
consumer colored PET powder (PC-PETColored) used in this study was
produced by grinding PETﬂakes purchased from a recycling company
(Yoochang R&C, Republic of Korea). Prior to milling to produce PET
powder, the PETﬂakes were washed with water and dried at a tem-
perature of 160 °C for 6 h. The extensively dried PETﬂakes were fed
into the twin-screw extruder with set temperatures to 260 °C in the
extruder zones, 275 °C in the discharge zones at 275 °C, and 275 °C in
the die plate, and an extrusion speed of 50 rpm. Theﬁlament was then
sequentially cooled into two water baths at temperatures of 75 °C and
60 °C, and excess water was removed using air wipers. Then, a single
hole die with a diameter of 3.0 mm was employed for pelletizing,
resulting in pellets of approximately 3 mm in length. The obtained PET
pellets were micronized using a cryogenic Micro Ball Mill. Particle size
distribution analysis of the PET samples was conducted using a HOR-
IBA LA 960S2 particle size analyzer in accordance with ISO 13320.
The particle size distributions, crystallinities, and molecular weights
(Mn, Mw, Mz) of PC-PET
Transparent and PC-PETColored are presented in
Supplementary Figs. 28, 29 and Supplementary Table. 3.
Selection of PETase candidates and phylogenetic analysis
Sequences were retrieved from the NCBI nonredundant (nr) protein
sequence database via PSI-BLAST (parameters: E-value of 1.00E-58, %
identity >40%) usingI. sakaiensisPETase (Accession code:GAP38373.1)
to query the model. Partial genes were removed from the retrieved
sequences, and then sequences of the PETase candidates were ran-
domly selected from the dataset. Multiple sequence alignment was
performed using Clustal omega
49. Phylogenetic reconstruction was
performed via maximum likelihood (ML) using MEGA11 with the
Dayhoff w/freq. model
50,51. The tree with the highest log likelihood
(−10401.10) is shown. Initial trees for heuristic search were obtained
automatically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a
matrix of pairwise distances estimated using the JTT model, and then
the topology with a superior log likelihood value was selected. Discrete
gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences
among sites (5 categories [+G, parameter = 1.6961]). The rate variation
model allowed for some sites to be evolutionarily invariable ([+I],
4.28% sites). This analysis involved 27 amino acid sequences, and there
was a total of 444 positions in theﬁnal dataset. Bootstrap values were
obtained from 1000 replicates
52. Sequence alignment of enzymes used
in phylogenetic tree analysis was depicted as a graphical illustration
using ESPript3 (Supplementary Fig. 1)
53. Pairwise identity and similarity
of the proteins were calculated using the Clustal omega method, and a
sequence identity matrix was created using excel software.
Plasmid construction and mutagenesis
All proteins used in this study were codons optimized forE. coli
expression. The signal peptides sequences were removed, and NdeI
and XhoI restriction sites were added to the 5′ and 3′ ends of the target
gene sequences, respectively. These DNA sequences were synthesized
by Twist Bioscience without signal peptides sequences. The signal
peptide cleavage sites for each sequence were predicted using SignalP
3.0 server. Ten PETase candidate genes as well asTfCut2 and LCC were
subcloned into a pET21b expression vector, andIsPETase was sub-
cloned into a pET15b expression vector. Site-directed mutagenesis
experiments were performed via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with
the oligonucleotides listed in Supplementary Table 4. All variants were
veriﬁed by sequencing.
Recombinant protein expression and puriﬁcation inE. coli
The constructed vectors were transformed intoE. coli strain Rosetta
gami-B (DE3), which was grown in lysogeny broth containing
100 mg L
−1 ampicillin at 37 °C until the optical density of the culture
broth reached a value of 0.6 at 600 nm. After induction by the addition
of 0.5 mM isopropylβ-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside, the culture was
further incubated at 18 °C for 20 h. Cells were harvested via cen-
trifugation at 4000 ×g for 15 min at 20 °C. The cell pellet of the 10
PETase candidates, LCC, andTfCut2 were resuspended in lysis buffer A
(40 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0), and the cell pellet ofIsPETase was resus-
pended in lysis buffer B (50 mM Na
2HPO4-HCl, pH 7.0). Cell lysis was
performed via ultrasonication, and the cell lysates were centrifuged at
13,500 ×g for 30 min. The cell-free crude enzymes were puriﬁed using
a Ni-NTA agarose column (Qiagen). After washing with buffers A and B
containing 30 mM imidazole, the target proteins were eluted using
300 mM imidazole in buffers A and B. All protein puriﬁcation experi-
ments were performed at 4 °C. The puriﬁed proteins were veriﬁed via
sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and
quantiﬁe du s i n gaB i o T e k
TM Epoch microplate spectrophotometer and
Gen5TM microplate data analysis software. The puriﬁed enzymes were
concentrated using an Amicon Ultra Centrifugalﬁlter unit (molecular
weight cutoff value of 10,000, Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA).

The expression and puriﬁcation of the variants ofCaPETase were
performed under the same conditions as the wild-type.
Melting temperature (Tm)m e a s u r e m e n t s
The thermal stability of the enzymes was determined by establishing
melting curves with a protein thermal shift dye (Applied Biosystems)
using a StepOnePlus Real-time PCR instrument (Thermo Fisher Sci-
entiﬁc). The reaction mixture contained 5µgo fp r o t e i n s ,1 0 0 m M
Na
2HPO4-HCl (pH 7.0), and 20µL of 1× protein thermal shift dye. Signal
changes representing protein denaturation were monitored by
increasing the temperature from 25 °C to 99 °C. Melting temperatures
were estimated from theﬁrst derivative curve. Theﬁrst derivative
curves of RFU forCaPETase
WT and its variants are presented in Sup-
plementary Fig. 30.
Crystallization and structure determination ofCaPETaseWT and
CaPETaseM9
Crystallization ofCaPETaseWT and CaPETaseM9 was initially performed
with commercially available spares-matrix screens Wizard I and II
(Rigaku), PEG/Ion, Index (Hampton Research), and Wizard CRYO I and

each experiment, 1.0 µL of the protein solution ( CaPETase
WT:
18.4 mg mL−1 in 40 mM Tris, pH 8.0, andCaPETaseM9: 22.3 mg mL−1 in
40 mM Tris, pH 8.0) was mixed with 1.0µL of reservoir solution and the
drop was equilibrated against 50µL of reservoir solution. The crystal of
CaPETaseWT appeared under conditions of 12% (v/v) PEG 3350 and
0.1 M sodium malonate (pH 4.0). The crystal ofCaPETaseM9 was

The deposited structures of5XJH (G30-S290),4EB0 (S36-Q293),4CG1
(A1-F261), and 7YM9 (D43-F299) were used forIsPETase, LCC,TfCut2,
and CaPETase residues and inner cavity water coordinates. All protein
models were prepared with protonation states at pH 9, as calculated by
propka3
61. The systems were prepared with ff19SB and OPC para-
meters for protein and explicit water and solvated in a cubic box of
70 Å length with 0.1 M Na+ and Cl- ions. We minimized the systems
using gromacs with conjugate gradient algorithm, and NVT-
equilibrated for 1 ns at 323.15 K, and then NPT-equilibrated for 1 ns
with a force constraint of 1000 kJ∙mol
−1∙nm−2. Production simulations
were performed for 200 ns at 323.15 K, and rmsﬂuctuations were
calculated with 10 ps interval trajectories. All simulations were per-
formed using Gromacs 2021.3 version package
62.
PET degradation assays
In the preliminary PET degradation assay of eight PETase candidates,
PC-PET
Transparent (15 mg mL−1) was soaked in 50 mM Glycine-NaOH pH
9.0 buffer with 500 nM enzyme. Cry-PET (15 mg mL−1)a n dh o l e -
punched amorphous PETﬁlm (⌀6 mm, roughly 10 mg) were soaked
in 50 mM Glycine-NaOH pH 9.0 buffer with 2µM enzyme. The reaction
mixtures (1 mL) were then incubated at temperatures of 30 °C, 40 °C,
50 °C, and 60 °C for 3 days. The reaction was terminated by heating the
mixture at 95 °C for 10 min. The reaction mixture with PET powder was
ﬁltered using a PVDF syringeﬁlter (0.22µm) to eliminate the residual
substrate. The samples were then analyzed using HPLC. All experi-
ments were performed in triplicate. The pH proﬁles on eight PETase
candidates were performed using PC-PET
Transparent (15 mg mL−1)i n
50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6-7), 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH
7-9), and 50 mM Glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 9-10) at 30 °C for 3 days. All
experiments were performed in triplicate. To compare the PET
hydrolytic activity ofCaPETase with LCC,IsPETase, andTfCut2, 15 mg
of Cry-PET was prepared and submerged in 1 mL of 50 mM glycine-
NaOH pH 9.0 buffer with 2µM enzyme. The reaction mixture was
incubated at 30 °C, 40 °C, 50 °C, and 60 °C for 12 h. Then, the reaction
mixture was treated as described above and analyzed using HPLC. All
experiments were performed in triplicate.
The PET hydrolytic activity ofCaPETase
WT and its variants was
determined using PC-PETTransparent. Enzyme reactions were performed
with 500 nM enzymes in 1 mL of 50 mM glycine-NaOH (pH 9.0) buffer
at 40 °C for 24 h. The reaction mixture was treated as described above
and analyzed using HPLC. All experiments were performed in tripli-
cate. To evaluate the PET-hydrolyzing activity of the combinatorial
variants of CaPETase, 500 nM enzyme was incubated with 100 mM
glycine-NaOH (pH 9.0) and 15 mg of PC-PET
Transparent at 40 °C for 24 h
and 60 °C for 6 h, respectively. The reaction mixture was treated as
described above and twofold diluted samples were analyzed using
HPLC. All experiments were performed in triplicate.
The comparison of PET hydrolytic activities ofCaPETase
WT and
CaPETaseM9 were performed using PC-PETTransparent (15 mg mL−1)a t3 0 ,
4 0 ,5 0 ,6 0 ,7 0° Cw i t h1µM enzymes in 1 mL of 50 mM glycine-NaOH
(pH 9.0) buffer. To further evaluateCaPETaseM9 for PET depolymer-
ization, the enzyme (1µM) was added to 50 mL of 200 mM Glycine-
NaOH pH 9.0, containing 100 mg of PC-PETTransparent in a 250-mLﬂask.
The ﬂask was incubated in a shaking incubator at 40 °C, 50 °C, 60 °C
and 180 rpm (40 °C for 72 h; 50 °C for 48 h; and 60 °C for 12 h). The
reaction mixtures were sampled at different time points to quantify the
total amount of released PET monomers. The samples wereﬁltered as
described above and 4-fold diluted samples were analyzed using HPLC.
All experiments were performed in triplicate.
To compare the PET hydrolytic activity of CaPETase
M9 with
LCCICCG, a membrane enclosed enzymatic catalysis (MEEC) system
were used. In this system, the PET degradation reaction was induced
on a cellulose dialysis membrane (Spectra/Por 2 Trial Kit, 12–14 kD,ﬂat
width 25 mm; Repligen, USA), and PC-PET
Transparent and Cry-PET were
used as substrate. 50 ( ± 2) mg of PC-PETTransparent and Cry-PET substrate
were immersed in a 4 mL of 200 mM Glycine-NaOH pH 9.0 with 1µM
and 4µM enzyme, respectively. Each reaction was packaged in a 4-mL
dialysis bag was immersed in 200 mL of 200 mM Glycine-NaOH pH
9.0. The reaction was performed at 30 °C, 40 °C, 50 °C, and 60 °C with
shaking at 80 rpm in a small shaking incubator (JEIO TECH, Republic of
Korea). Sample was taken from the external equilibrium solution,

diluted 5-fold, and then analyzed by HPLC. All experiments were per-
formed in triplicate.
Enzyme heat-inactivation
Protein heat inactivation experiments were performed using
CaPETase
WT and CaPETaseM9. Enzyme mixtures (500 nM enzyme in
1 mL of 50 mM glycine-NaOH, pH 9.0) were incubated at 60 °C and
70 °C for 10 min to 12 h and 5 min to 12 h, respectively. Then, 15 mg of
PC-PET
Transparent was added to the heat-inactivated mixture, and the
reaction mixture was incubated at 40 °C for 1 day. The mixture was
ﬁltered using a PVDF syringeﬁlter (0.22µm) and the samples were
analyzed using HPLC.
PET depolymerization in a pH-stat bioreactor
A customized stirred bioreactor (MARADO-PDA, BIOCNS Co. Ltd,
Korea) equipped with two standard Rushton impellers was designed
for PET depolymerization. It was interfaced with a personal computer
for data recording. The temperature was regulated using a refrigera-
tion and heating bath circulator (RW3-1025, JEIO TECH, Daejeon,
Republic of Korea). CaPETase
M9 (10.2 mg) was added to a 150-mL
solution containing 10 mM Na2HPO4 (pH 8.0) and 3.75 g PC-PET and
incubated at 55 °C and 200 rpm. The pH was regulated at 8.0 by the
adding 0.3575 M NaOH (40%; extra pure grade, Duksan, Republic of
Korea) solution using a PID controller. The reactor solution was sam-
pled during the reaction andﬁltered through a PVDF syringeﬁlter
(0.22µm) to remove residual PET powder. The resulting samples were
diluted with 50 mM glycine-NaOH (pH 9.0) and analyzed using HPLC to
quantify the amount of released PET monomer. The PET depolymer-
ization rate was calculated by considering the sum of the hydrolysis
products (TPA and MHET). All experiments were performed in
triplicate.
Depolymerization of post-consumer PET container
Fragments of a post-consumer PET container (salad container) were
prepared in a circular form (⌀14 mm, 50 mg). The reaction was per-
formed using a membrane-enclosed enzymatic catalysis method. The
dialysis membrane bag (Carl Roth, Product number 0653.1, MWCO
14000) was loaded with 1µM of CaPETase
M9 dissolved in 4 mL of
50 mM glycine-NaOH (pH 9.0) buffer and post-consumer PET frag-
ment. Theﬁlled membrane bag was immersed into a container con-
taining 196 mL of 50 mM glycine-NaOH (pH 9.0) buffer and incubated
on a shaker for 84 h at 60 °C and 80 rpm. Samples were removed from
the solution on the outside at different time points (0, 12, 24, 30, 36,
48, 60, 72, and 84 h) to quantify the total amount of released PET
monomers. The samples were analyzed using HPLC. All experiments
were performed in triplicate.
HPLC analysis
Samples were analyzed using a CBM-20A (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan)
connected to a UV/Vis detector (SPD-20A) and a C18 column (Shi-
madzu Shim-pack GIS ODS-I C18, 5µm, 4.6 × 150 mm). Mobile phases A
(0.1% formic acid) and B (20% acetonitrile) were used at aﬂow rate of
1m Lm i n
−1. The elution program was as follows: 0–2m i n , 6 0 %–80%
buffer B, linear gradient; 2–8m i n ,8 0 %–100% buffer B, linear gradient;
8–16 min, 100% buffer B. The hydrolysis products (TPA, MHET, and
BHET) were separated at 40 °C and detected at 260 nm. Amounts of
TPA, MHET, and BHET were measured using standard curves prepared
from commercial TPA (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA, Cat. No.: 185361),
BHET (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA, Cat. No.: 465151), and MHET (Ambeed,
IL, USA, Cat. No.: A875019).
Differential scanning calorimetry for crystallinity measurement
of PET samples
The thermal crystallinity of PET samples was estimated using a
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) instrument (Q2000, TA
instrument). For the DSC thermographs, 5 mg of samples were equi-
librated at 30 °C and heated to 300 °C at a heating rate of 10 °C min−1.
T h es a m p l ew a sq u e n c h e dt o3 0° Ca t1 0° Cm i n−1.H e a to ff u s i o n(ΔHm)
and cold crystallization (ΔHc) were determined by integrating the
areas (J g-1) under the peaks. The enthalpy of melting for a fully crys-
talline PET (ΔHf) was 140.1 J/g. The percent of crystallinity was calcu-
lated based on the following equation:
crystallinityð%Þ = ð4Hm /C04 HcÞ
4Hf ×1 0 0 % ð1Þ
DSC curves for the crystallinity of the PET samples are presented
in Supplementary Fig. 29.
Gel permeation chromatography (GPC)
The molecular weight of the PET samples was measured using gel-
permeation chromatography (GPC) using an EcoSEC HLC-8320 GPC
instrument (Tosoh Bioscience, Tokyo, Japan). The TSKgel SuperAWM-
H column was used with a mobile phase of 0.01 N sodium tri-
ﬂuoroacetate (NaTFA) in hexaﬂuoroisopropanol (HFIP) at aﬂow rate
0 . 3m Lm i n
−1 at 40 °C, and 30 min run time per sample. The injected
sample volume was 20μL. The molecular weights (Mn, Mw, Mp) were
determined relative to polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) standards.
The PET samples and PMMA were dissolved in 6% v/v hexa-
ﬂuoroisopropanol (HFIP) in chloroform to a concentration of
3m gm L
−1, and the solution was ﬁltered through a polytetra-
ﬂuoroethylene (PTFE) membrane with a pore size of 0.45μm.
