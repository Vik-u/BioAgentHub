ABSTRACT: Plastic-degrading enzymes, particularly poly(ethylene terephtha-
late) (PET) hydrolases, have garnered significant attention in recent years as
potential eco-friendly solutions for recycling plastic waste. However, under-
standing of their PET-degrading activity and influencing factors remains
incomplete, impeding the development of uniform approaches for enhancing
PET hydrolases for industrial applications. A key aspect of PET hydrolase
engineering is optimizing the PET-hydrolysis reaction by lowering the associated
free energy barrier. However, inconsistent findings have complicated these efforts.
Therefore, our goal is to elucidate various aspects of enzymatic PET degradation
by means of quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) reaction
simulations and analysis, focusing on the initial reaction step, acylation, in two
thermophilic PET hydrolases, LCC and PES-H1, along with their highly active variants, LCC
IG
and PES-H1
FY
. Our findings
highlight the impact of semiempirical QM methods on proton transfer energies, affecting the distinction between a two-step reaction
involving a metastable tetrahedral intermediate and a one-step reaction. Moreover, we uncovered a concerted conformational change
involving the orientation of the PET benzene ring, altering its interaction with the side-chain of the “wobbling” tryptophan from T-
stacking to parallel π−π interactions, a phenomenon overlooked in prior research. Our study thus enhances the understanding of the
acylation mechanism of PET hydrolases, in particular by characterizing it for the first time for the promising PES-H1
FY
using QM/
MM simulations. It also provides insights into selecting a suitable QM method and a reaction coordinate, valuable for future studies
on PET degradation processes.

INTRODUCTION
Synthetic polymers, commonly referred to as plastics, have
gained significant attraction in the global market due to their
durability, affordability, and versatility.
1,2
Presently, degrada-
tion methods for the immense amount of accumulated plastic
waste are both environmentally and economically costly,
pressing the need for an eco-friendly and efficient alternative.
3
Enzymatic degradation emerges as a promising solution,
particularly focusing on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET),
a widely used plastic in packaging and textiles.
4,5
The discovery
of enzymes capable of PET degradation in 2005
6
and the
identification of Ideonella sakaiensis as an organism metaboliz-
ing PET
7
in 2016 have paved the way for enzymatic
degradation.
Enzymes with PET-degradation function are often found
among hydrolases (EC 3.1.1.x) and specifically cutinases (EC
3.1.1.74), but are now often categorized into the novel class of
polyester hydrolases (EC 3.1.1.101).
7−9
These enzymes share
an α/β-hydrolase fold characterized by a core comprising eight
β-strands and six α-helices with a surface-exposed catalytic
triad typically composed of serine, aspartate, and histidine,
facilitating PET hydrolysis.
10,11
Despite some wild-type (WT)
enzymes exhibiting high activities, enzyme engineering is
necessary to enhance efficiency and stability to facilitate
industrial application. This has yielded two of the currently
most active PET-degrading enzymes, the leave-branch com-
post cutinase F243I/D238C/S283C/Y127G (LCC
ICCG
) and
polyester hydrolase I L92F/Q94Y (PES-H1
FY
) variants.
5,12,13
Notably, these two variants share a mutation at the same
position, yet with divergent effects: activity of LCC could be
enhanced by elimination of tyrosine (Y127G) in addition to
other mutations present in the LCC
ICCG
variant, while an
introduction of tyrosine (Q94Y) in combination with
introduction of phenylalanine in close proximity yielded the
PES-H1
FY
variant with increased activity.

found that the entry of PET into the active binding cleft and
the subsequent Michaelis complex (MC) formation is
promoted by the LCC F243I/Y127G (IG) variant
14
but the
precise effect remains unclear and demands elucidation of the
energy profile of the first reaction step, acylation, to fully
understand MC stabilization.
The catalytic hydrolysis reaction of several PET-degrading
enzymes was previously investigated using quantum mechan-
ics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) simulation studies, which
enable investigation of the region contributing to the target
reaction at the QM level for bond breaking and formation,
while managing the computational demand by treating the
remaining part of the system at the MM level.
15−17
These
studies revealed two predominant binding poses of PET: pro-
S
18−20
and pro-R.
5,21
An energetic preference for catalysis
starting from the pro-S pose is proposed, which allows for T-
stacking π−π interactions between PET’s benzene ring and a
conserved tryptophan positioned at one end of the catalytic
binding cleft, which is also called “wobbling” tryptophan
(LCC: W190, PES-H1: W155).
15,22
The catalysis mechanism
after substrate binding can be divided into two main processes:
acylation and deacylation (Figure 1).
15−17,23−26
During
acylation, the catalytic serine’s nucleophilicity increases via
proton transfer to the catalytic histidine, which is polarized by
the catalytic aspartate. This facilitates nucleophilic attack on
the ester’s carbonyl carbon, with the resulting oxyanion
stabilized by the oxyanion hole.
Subsequent cleavage of the ester bond yields the acyl-
enzyme intermediate (AE), releasing an alcohol molecule from
the active site after a proton transfer from the catalytic
histidine to the resulting oxyanion. In deacylation, a water
molecule’s oxygen nucleophilically attacks the carbonyl carbon
of AE, generating a second tetrahedral intermediate (TI) and
reprotonating the catalytic histidine. Finally, the AE bond
breaks, yielding the second product with a carboxyl group,
while the serine is reprotonated, restoring the initial state.
Products comprise smaller PET oligomers, as well as mono(2-
hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET), bis(2-hydroxyethyl)
terephthalic acid (BHET) and the final monomers terephthalic
acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG).
27−29
There is debate over whether acylation and deacylation
occur in one or two steps, with the TI potentially representing
a tetrahedral transition state (TS).
15,16
Identifying the rate-
determining step remains challenging, with some studies
suggesting acylation and others deacylation.
15,17,23−26,30−32
Product diffusion from the active site, necessary for subsequent
substrate hydrolysis, may also be rate-limiting, as suggested by
Shrimpton-Phoenix et al.,
31
though others contest this
notion.
26
Various studies discuss the catalytic histidine’s
polarization mechanisms, considering proton transfer in
addition to pure polarization.
20,25,31
QM/MM studies highlight
the role of specific amino acids (Ser, Ile, Ala) near the catalytic
aspartate in stabilizing the histidine, influencing proton transfer
dynamics.
23,33
Mutation experiments confirm the importance
of isoleucine, with alanine substitutions resulting in activity
loss.
23
Such insights are crucial for evaluating mutation sites,
particularly in enzyme redesign aiming to lower the free
activation energy by stabilizing transition states, beyond
substrate binding.
34,35
Another interesting residue is a conserved tryptophan, the
“wobbling” tryptophan, which exhibits three different con-
formations in the mesophilic Ideonella sakaiensis PETase
(IsPETase), while maintaining a single conformation in
other, mostly thermophilic polyester hydrolases.
20,36
This
rigidity is attributed to steric hindrance by a nearby histidine,
which in IsPETase is substituted by a serine. Extensive MD and
metadynamics simulations, coupled with experimental anal-
yses, have revealed that the presence of this serine and an
adjacent isoleucine in IsPETase, instead of histidine and
phenylalanine in other PET-degrading enzymes, enhances the
flexibility of the tryptophan and loop regions within the active
site, positively impacting activity.
37,38
Moreover, the conforma-
tional flexibility of tryptophan allows T-shaped π−π inter-
actions with PET’s benzene ring, thereby expanding the space
within the active site and favoring PET binding. Following
hydrolysis, suggested conformational changes of the PET
benzene ring lead to energetically less favored face-to-face
stacking and promote product release.
20,36,38
While it was found that the conformational flexibility of the
“wobbling” tryptophan in IsPETase is important for the PET
degradation activity,
32
the detailed impact of the “wobbling”
tryptophan on the reaction energetics and the PET
conformation remains unexplored. Moreover, prior publica-
tions propose inconsistent conclusions regarding whether the
acylation mechanism occurs as a one- or two-step proc-
ess.
15−17,26
Here, we investigate these two issues in relation to
the acylation reaction, and not directly on whether acylation or
deacylation is rate-determining (which may be enzyme
dependent
17
). We aim to elucidate the conformational change
of the benzene ring of PET and its interaction with the
Figure 1. Mechanism of PET degradation as proposed by Boneta et al.
15
The mechanism can be divided into two steps: First, the acylation of the
Michaelis complex (MC) yielding the acyl-enzyme intermediate (AE), and second, the hydrolysis yielding the product complex (PC), both
incorporating a tetrahedral intermediate (TI). This study focuses on the acylation step leading from MC to AE, as shown in the top row.

“wobbling” tryptophan on the acylation reaction, and
distinguish between the possible one- or two-step mechanisms.
By investigating two variants of two PETases, we further can
highlight whether the more efficient variants show a reduction
in the free energy barrier for acylation.
To this end, we performed QM/MM simulations of the
acylation step of PES-H1 and LCC as well as their variants,
PES-H1
FY
and LCC
IG
, the latter representing LCC
ICCG
excluding the stabilizing disulfide bridge. This is the first
QM/MM investigation of PES-H1, and we provide additional
insights into the LCC, which has been analyzed in several
previous studies and thus allows for comparison and validation
of our results.
15,17,22,24,33
The QM/MM method is used in
combination with the adaptive string method (ASM),
39
which
offers a flexible approach for incorporating collective variables
to delineate the reaction pathway. This methodology sheds
light on the previously overlooked impact of the “wobbling”
tryptophan, addressing gaps in our understanding of PET
degradation mechanisms, thus helping to drive the develop-
ment of industrially applicable enzymes.

METHODS
Parameterization. The parametrization of a small PET
analogue, comprised of three units, has been previously
documented by Pfaff and colleagues.
13
To model the analogue
of AE, three residues additional were parametrized using the
same methodology applied to PET. These residues specifically
represent the serine bonded to PET and two residues
corresponding to the units subsequent to the cleavage of the
connecting ester bond. The parametrization procedure
involved quantum mechanics calculations conducted at the
HF/6-31G* level using Gaussian 09.
40
This was undertaken to
establish generalized AMBER force field (GAFF)
41
parameters
for both the terminal and central units. Subsequently,
restrained electrostatic potential (RESP) calculations
42,43
were executed through the antechamber tool
44,45
available in
AmberTools 21.
46
This step resulted in initial partial charges,
which were then redistributed using prepgen to achieve a zero
net charge for each PET unit.
Preparation of Input Structures. The methodological
workflow explained in the following is highlighted in Figure 2.
For both enzymes PES-H1 and LCC, the conformation with
the catalytic serine on the si-side of the PET chain and the
minimum distance between the PET ester carbon and the γ
oxygen of this serine were extracted from previous Hamil-
tonian replica exchange molecular dynamics (HREMD)
simulations using PDB 7CUV (chain B) for PES-H1 and
PDB 4EBO for LCC.
14
These starting structures consist of a
PET molecule with five units plus the enzyme. The starting
structures for the variants PES-H1
FY
and LCC
IG
were
generated by introducing the corresponding mutations into
these starting structures using PyMOL.
47
The systems were
solvated and neutralized by the addition of TIP3P water and
sodium or chloride ions, respectively, using tleap. This resulted
in ∼29,150 atoms for the PES-H1 systems and ∼28,500 atoms
for the LCC systems. The enzymes were represented using the
AMBER14SB force field, and parameters for the three PET
unit types (i.e., two types of terminal and the central units)
were incorporated using tleap as implemented in AMBER.
46
The protonation states of titratable amino acids were modeled
as predicted by Propka 3.4,
48,49
resulting in a net charge of +5
for LCC and LCC
IG
and −5 for PES-H1 and PES-H1
FY
(see
the Supporting Information for details).
14
The energy of the
solvated systems was minimized using the steepest descent
algorithm
50
followed by the conjugate gradient algorithm.
51
Subsequent equilibration runs were performed at a temper-
ature of 303 K and pressure of 1 bar in the NVT and NPT
ensemble, utilizing the Langevin thermostat
52
and the
Berendsen barostat,
53
respectively, with restraints applied to
the positions of the protein and PET atoms. The MD
production runs at the MM level spanned 20 ns in the NPT
ensemble and included one-sided harmonic distance restraints
to hold the PET ester in a productive pose. The one-sided
harmonic restraint with a force constant of 20 kcal/mol/Å
2
,
was initiated for a distance above 3.5 Å between the catalytic
serine’s γ-oxygen and the PET’s ester carbon and for a distance
above 3 Å between the PET’s ester carbonyl-oxygen and the
center of mass of the backbone amine’s nitrogen of the
oxyanion hole residues. This restraint becomes linear for
distances above 10 Å. The SHAKE algorithm
54
was used to
constrain all bonds involving hydrogen atoms. A periodic box
was employed for all runs. To reduce the computational
demand, a cutoff at 8 Å was applied for the calculation of the
short-range nonbonded interactions, and the particle mesh
Ewald method
55,56
was used to treat electrostatic interactions.
The AE for each of the four systems was created from the
reactant’s structure after the MM production run using
PyMOL, retaining water molecules, ions, and box dimensions.
The same protocol as for the reactants was followed including
setup, minimization, MM equilibration, and 20 ns production
run. Here, the distances describing the reaction and therefore
used as collective variables (CVs) in the QM/MM simulations
(see below) had to be restrained to keep the two PET units
adjacent to the broken ester bond within the AE basin. Since
the overall conformation of the long, flexible PET chain was
altered due to conformational changes in the PET units other
than the cleavage site during the MM production runs, the AE
structure was subjected to the QM/MM preparation right after
MM minimization. This involved a QM/MM optimization

using steepest descent and conjugate gradient for both,
reactant and AE. Only for the AE, a 50 ps QM/MM run
was performed in the NVT ensemble applying a harmonic
restraint to adjust the tryptophan−PET angle to the prevalent
one during the MM production run. For the PES-H1
FY
variant,
this step was skipped as the preferred tryptophan−PET angle
was already obtained after MM MD and was therefore already
present after QM/MM optimization. The last step before the
actual ASM run comprised an unrestrained 50 ps QM/MM
relaxation in the NVT ensemble for both reactant and AE of
each system. The QM region comprised 66 atoms and 5 link
atoms for PES-H1 and PES-H1
FY
, and 64 atoms and 4 link
atoms for LCC and LCC
IG
. It includes the side chains of the
catalytic serine, histidine, and aspartate, as well as two PET
units connected by the scissile ester bond (Figure 3 A and B).
In the case of LCC/LCC
IG
, one of these units is the terminal
one. It was described by the DFTB3 method without using the
SHAKE algorithm, to allow for proton transfers.
57
As
nonbonded cutoff, 10 Å was used.
ASM. The simulation of PET acylation (MC → AE, see
Figure 1) was conducted using the ASM in connection with
QM/MM with DFTB3 as QM method and AMBER14SB plus
TIP3P for the MM region, as implemented in AMBER.
39,46
The initial and final states for the pathway connecting the
reactant and the AE in CV space were defined through QM/
MM relaxation simulations. As CVs, eight variables were used:
five distances describing the reaction, one dihedral angle θ
representing the change in orientation of the PET ring, and
two point-to-plane distances reflecting the hybridization state
of the PET ester’s carbon to enhance convergence (Figure 3B
and C). MD simulations were initiated from a total of 96
nodes, equidistantly positioned along the initial guess. Half of
these simulations started from the reactant state, while the
other half began from the AE state. The structures were
brought to the corresponding node positions during 1 ps MD
runs by gradually increasing the force constants of the biasing
potential from zero to the target value automatically
determined by ASM. Upon convergence of the string to the
minimum free-energy path (MFEP), a path collective variable
(path-CV) was defined to monitor the progress along this path
and consequently, the advancement along the reaction.
Umbrella sampling MD (USMD) simulations
58,59
were then
performed, restraining each replica to the corresponding node
on the string for the US windows using an automatically
defined potential. The potential of mean force (PMF) was
obtained via umbrella integration (UI)
60−62
and assumed to be
converged when the 95% confidence interval at the TS fell
below 1 kcal/mol.
DFT Correction. The PMFs obtained from the ASM runs
were corrected to the M06-2X/6-31+G(d,p) level of theory
63
by applying a cubic splines correction based on single-point
energy calculations for relaxed structures along the reaction
path. The details of the method can be found in the original
publication.
64
Briefly, the selected structures were first

connected via the scissile ester bond and the side chains of the three catalytic triad residues (PES-H1: S130, D176, H208; LCC: S165, D210,

marked by a blue circle. The remaining atoms forming the plane include those in the ester between the PET units in the MC and the ester between
PET and the catalytic serine in the AE, respectively. (C) An additional dihedral CV for dihedral angle θ is included to represent the angle between

optimized using the DFTB3 method, followed by single-point
calculations using the M06-2X functional with the 6-31+G-
(d,p) basis set, employing the Gaussian 09 software.
40
The
energy difference (ΔE = E
DFT
− E
DFTB3
) was then interpolated
and subtracted from the original PMF values to obtain the
corrected PMF. The method relies on the assumption that the
MFEP at low and high levels of theory are sufficiently similar.
This was checked by performing climbing-image nudged-
elastic band (CI-NEB)
65
calculations for the reaction process
at the M06-2X/6-31+G(d,p)/MM level of theory and
comparing the path to the MFEP obtained with ASM (Figure
S4).

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
MC and AE Prefer Different PET Ring Orientations. To
conduct QM/MM simulations of PET acylation, we extracted
starting structures of PET−enzyme complexes from our
previous Hamiltonian replica exchange MD simulations,
which included a PET chain with 5 units and either LCC or
PES-H1.
14
The initial configurations for the LCC
IG
and PES-
H1
FY
variants were obtained by introducing the corresponding
mutations. Analysis of these binding poses revealed that the
two PET units sharing the scissile ester bond are tightly bound,
whereas the units further away exhibit looser interactions with
the enzyme. The four resultant Michaelis complexes (MCs)
were subjected to 20 ns MM simulations, which confirmed the
stability of the chosen binding poses. However, the chain
termini remained flexible (Figure S1). The final structures
served as templates to manually generate AE structures using
PyMOL, which were then also subjected to 20 ns MM
simulations, with restraints being applied to prevent the leaving
group from diffusing away from the AE. Two notable findings
emerged: First, the flexibility of the loosely bound PET units
further away from the scissile ester bond resulted in
conformations unsuitable for subsequent QM/MM simula-
tions using the ASM due to their difference to the MC
conformations (Figure 3D, left). Second, the benzene ring of
PET bound to the catalytic serine in the AE demonstrated a
preference for a parallel orientation with respect to the
“wobbling” tryptophan, whereas the MC favored a T-stacked
orientation. This transition from T-stacked to parallel π−π
interactions was observed during MM minimization (PES-
H1
FY
) and during the beginning (LCC, LCC
IG
) or middle
(PES-H1) of the MM production run. This shift, previously
discussed by Han et al.
20
in the context of product liberation,
was not specifically mapped to a reaction step by the authors.
Our results suggest that this transition occurs during the
acylation phase. To address these findings, we only conducted
energy minimization for the AE structures at the MM level and
then switched to the QM/MM level where we performed
energy minimization and a 50 ps MD run with restraints to
enforce the transition of the benzene ring from T-stacked to
parallel. Since plane angles are not currently implemented as
restraints or CVs in the ASM, we have identified a dihedral
angle θ that correlates well with the plane angle change and
can be used both as a restraint during structure preparation
and as a CV during ASM reaction simulation (Figure 3C and
4). A dihedral angle θ of approximately 0° corresponds to a T-
stacked orientation, while an angle of approximately 90°
indicates a parallel orientation. After enforcing the preferred
parallel plane−plane angle in the AE, both MC and AE
structures were subjected to a 50 ps QM/MM relaxation
without restraints before conducting the final ASM run. This
approach resulted in MC and AE structures that were close
enough to each other for the ASM, as the PET did not move as
much in the QM/MM runs of the AE as it did in the MM runs
(Figure 3D, right).
PET Ring Orientation Change Correlates with
Acylation. To perform QM/MM calculations, we used the
final MC and AE structures after 50 ps QM/MM relaxation as
input configurations (Figure S2). We employed the semi-
empirical DFTB3 method
57
to describe the QM region,
encompassing the side chains of the catalytic residues (LCC
and LCC
IG
: S165, D210, H242; PES-H1 and PES-H1
FY
: S130,
D176, H208) and the two PET units sharing the scissile ester
(Figure 3). This QM method, successfully applied in previous
studies in combination with ASM, offers a balanced trade-off
between accuracy and computational demand.
16
Additionally, we corrected the resulting PMF on DFT level
using the M06-2X functional
63
with the 6-31+G(d,p) basis set,
which has proven effective in QM/MM studies of PET
hydrolases.
15,17
We used relevant distances depicting bond
formations and breaking during the reaction as CVs, alongside
two point-plane distances defining the hybridization state of
the PET ester’s carbon, to enhance convergence.
16
Further-
more, we included the dihedral angle θ as a CV to monitor the
plane angle change. Average values for each CV, as well as the
plane angle were calculated for each node after the ASM string
was converged (Figure 5 and 6). In all cases, a smooth
transition from a dihedral angle θ of approximately 0° (T-
stacking) to approximately ±90° (parallel orientation) toward
the ring plane of the “wobbling” tryptophan was revealed,
showing good correlation with the plane angle change during
the reaction. This smooth transition underscores the
importance of including the plane angle change as a dihedral
CV. As a proof of concept, we performed the same ASM
calculation for PES-H1
FY
without including the dihedral θ CV.
In this case, the dihedral θ for MC and AE was not fixed,
allowing for more flexibility and a mixture of parallel
conformations adopted after 90° rotation and T-stacked
conformations, which are adopted after 180° rotation, when
approaching the product. Therefore, the PET ring atom
defining the dihedral angle θ of this new T-stacked
conformation points away from the “wobbling” tryptophan
Figure 4. Dihedral angle θ (orange) and the angle between the
tryptophan and PET ring planes (red) during the 20 ns MM
production run of the AE of PES-H1.

instead of toward it as in the MC, which explains the slight
difference between the dihedral angle θ in the MC and the AE
(Figure 7). Thus, the change in ring orientation happens even
when it is not included as a CV, highlighting the link between
this motion and the reaction. The progression of the distance
CVs in combination with the PMFs describes the course of the
reaction and enables mapping the ring orientation change to a
specific step during the acylation reaction (Figure 5 and 6).
The reaction mechanism matches that from previous works,
suggesting a two-step acylation with the tetrahedral inter-
mediate state as a shallow minimum on the free energy
surface.
15,17,22−25,30,33
First, the catalytic histidine abstracts a
proton from the catalytic serine, resulting in TS1 (Figure 1).
Then, the serine attacks the ester carbon, yielding the
tetrahedral intermediate with its oxyanion stabilized by the
oxyanion hole. While the converged MFEPs do not change
significantly upon inclusion of the dihedral CV (see Figure S5),
the mixing of states in absence of the dihedral CV affects the
resulting PMFs. For instance, in case of LCC
IG
, the
calculations fail to resolve the two transition states, resulting
in an apparently single-step process.
The oxyanion is then converted back into a carbonyl oxygen
by breaking the ester bond between the two PET units,
generating a new oxyanion. The second transition state
corresponds to the second proton transfer from the catalytic
histidine to this oxyanion of the leaving group, liberating an
alcohol and resulting in the AE. The steepest change in the
plane angle and the dihedral angle θ begins with the formation
of the tetrahedral intermediate, and in the case of LCC
IG
after
the second proton transfer, and is thus concerted with the
acylation (Figure 5 and 6). Comparison of the PMFs of the
ASM runs with and without the dihedral θ CV shows that the
barriers in the DFT-corrected PMFs are somewhat larger when
the dihedral θ CV is not included, suggesting that the
conformational change of the plane angle during the reaction is
energetically favorable, but this is neglected when the
corresponding CV is omitted (Figure 7).

by DFT (M06-2X/6-31G(d,p)) shows that the energy barriers
are generally much lower for DFTB3, most likely due to an
underestimation of the energy barrier for proton transfer with
DFTB3 (Figures 7 and S3). In general, the choice of the QM
method influences the PMF outcome, which is mirrored by the
diverging results in previous works, suggesting either a one-
step
16,26
or a two-step
15,17,22−25,30,31,33
mechanism for the
acylation of PET hydrolases.
As an example, Boneta et al. used the AM1
66
method to
describe the QM region and corrected the resulting PMF on
DFT level using the M06-2X functional
63
with the 6-
31+G(d,p) basis set, i.e. the same correction as applied in
this study. This yielded a clear two-step PMF for LCC
ICCG
and
IsPETase, which may have been favored by AM1, as AM1
tends to overestimate energy barriers.
15
On the other hand,
QM/MM free energy profiles obtained using DFTB3, which
tends to underestimate proton transfer barriers,
16
indicate a
one-step profile for the FAST-PETase
16
and the IsPETase.
32
Similarly, Jerves et al. postulated a one-step profile using the
Figure 5. PMF of the PET acylation (MC → AE, see Figure 1) of PES-H1 (left) and its highly active variant PES-H1
FY
(right). The height of the
two barriers is provided as well. The lower plots show the corresponding averaged distance CV values per node during umbrella sampling of the
converged string and, thus, depicts the CV progression along the reaction. Node 0 corresponds to the MC and node 96 to the AE state.
Additionally, the angle between the ring planes of the “wobbling” tryptophan and the PET benzene moiety is plotted in red to highlight the
correlation with the dihedral angle θ change in orange.

Perdew−Burke−Ernzerhof (PBE) functional,
67,68
which also
gives small energy barriers for proton transfers.
26,69,70
The PMFs obtained here using the DFTB3 method also
suggest that the reaction might be a one-step rather than a two-
step mechanism (with either a very shallow or no significant
minimum for the TI), but it is turned into a clear two-step
profile upon correction to DFT (M06-2X) (Figures 7, S3, 5
and 6). Interestingly, when the dihedral angle controlling the
orientation of the “wobbling” tryptophan is added as a CV, the
apparent single step acylation in LCC
IG
got resolved into a
two-step process. This could further explain the single-step
acylation observed in other studies,
16,26,32
who did not
consider coupling between the dihedral angle and the reaction
coordinate. We therefore suggest a two-step mechanism
including a metastable intermediate state for the acylation
stage of PET degradation, which may appear as a one-step
mechanism when using methods underestimating proton
transfer energies such as DFTB3 and PBE, or incomplete
inclusion of relevant degrees of freedom.
Decreased Acylation Barrier As One Reason for
Increased Activity of Variants LCC
IG
and PES-H1
FY
. In
our previous study, the effect of single residues on the entry of
PET into the active site of LCC and PES-H1 and their high-
activity variants LCC
ICCG
(represented by LCC
IG
) and PES-
H1
FY
was analyzed.
14
The free energy surfaces of a PET chain
moving into the active site suggested that the mutated residues
promote PET entry by facilitating an unhindered entry and by
stabilizing the bound over the unbound PET state. Our current
results further show that both variants exhibit significantly
lower activation free energy barriers for acylation (considering
a 95% confidence interval of ≈1 kcal·mol
−1
; Figure 5 and 6).
The MC of the variants has the same or a higher energy than
the corresponding AE in the corrected PMF, while it exhibits a
lower energy in the WT profiles. This indicates either a
destabilization of the MC or a stabilization of the AE upon
mutation. A destabilization of the MC would explain the
reduced activation free energy barrier with respect to the MC,
while stabilization of the AE would imply enhanced
stabilization of the TSs. However, in our previous study
involving a free energy analysis of PET binding, we identified a
stabilization of the MC upon mutation for all mutation sites in
the variants LCC
IG
and PES-H1
FY
.
14
It is worth pointing out
that the positions of the TSs in the CV space do not differ
significantly between the variants (see Figure S6). This
indicates that the differences in the environment only change
the energy profile of the reaction, without altering the
geometry of the TSs. We therefore conclude that stabilization
of the TS and AE (with respect to the MC) is the cause of the
changes in the PMF and the reduction of the activation free
energy barrier, which promotes acylation and potentially also
the PET-degradation activity of the variants, as experimentally
established.

CONCLUSION
This study explored the initial chemical step of enzymatic PET
degradation, the acylation process, in detail, using QM/MM
MD sampling with the adaptive string method (ASM). We
focused on two well-studied PET hydrolases, LCC and
Figure 6. PMF of the PET acylation (MC → AE, see Figure 1) of LCC (left) and its highly active variant LCC
IG

barriers is provided as well. The lower plots shows the corresponding averaged distance CV values per node during umbrella sampling of the
converged string and, thus, depicts the CV progression along the reaction. Node 0 corresponds to the MC and node 96 to the AE state.
Additionally, the angle between the ring planes of the “wobbling” tryptophan and the PET benzene moiety is plotted in red to highlight the

Our investigation revealed two distinct con-
formations of the PET benzene ring, facilitating different types
of π−π interactions with the “wobbling” tryptophan residue in
the MC (T-stacked) and AE (parallel). This conformational
shift appears to occur concertedly with acylation and
contributes to the resulting free energy profile. Therefore, it
is crucial to consider the varying orientations of the PET
benzene ring during QM/MM simulations (e.g., by including a
CV describing this during sampling), an aspect previously
overlooked. Furthermore, we found that acylation proceeds
through a two-step process involving a metastable tetrahedral
intermediate, which is potentially missed in other studies due
to the QM method employed. Additionally, both high-activity
variants exhibited reduced activation free energy barriers
compared to their respective WT enzymes. Interestingly, in
the variants, the MC and AE states were energetically
equivalent, whereas the MC is more stable in the WT
enzymes. We hypothesize that this relative stabilization of the
AE is coupled with the stabilization of the transition state,
contributing to enhanced activity. However, we assume that
the reduction of the energy barrier by approximately 2−5 kcal/
mol is not the only factor driving the substantial activity
increase. The multifaceted nature of PET enzyme activity is
influenced by various mechanisms such as substrate
adsorption, entry to the binding site, productive substrate
binding, and product liberation, in addition to the catalysis of
the chemical process of substrate conversion addressed here.
Consequently, comprehending the heightened PET-degrada-
tion activity of LCC
ICCG
and PES-H1
FY
demands a
comprehensive approach encompassing all pertinent mecha-
nisms.
