Recent advances in the enzymatic degradation of poly(ethylene terphthalate) (PET) have led to a number of
PET hydrolytic enzymes and mutants being developed. With the amount of PET building up in the natural
world, there is a pressing need to develop scalable methods of breaking down the polymer into its
monomers for recycling or other uses. Mechanoenzymatic reactions have gained traction recently as
a green and eﬃcient alternative to traditional biocatalytic reactions. For theﬁrst time we report increased
yields of PET degradation by whole cell PETase enzymes by up to 27-fold by utilising ball milling cycles
of reactive aging, when compared with typical solution-based reactions. This methodology leads to up
to a 2600-fold decrease in the solvent required when compared with other leading degradation
reactions in the ﬁeld and a 30-fold decrease in comparison to reported industrial scale PET hydrolysis
reactions.
Introduction
Global plastic production reached 460 million tonnes in 2019,1
with PET constituting approximately 10% of this value,2 which
because of its resistance to degradation, has led to its accu-
mulation in the environment. The production of PET is pro-
jected to increase annually, and current thermomechanical
methods of recycling reduce the quality of the plastic, limiting
post-recycling applications, whilst chemical degradation of PET
requires the use of both harsh conditions and strong acids or
bases. For these reasons and to increase the value of the recy-
cled product, improved recycling methods are needed. The
molecular recycling of PET via depolymerisation into its
building blocks (for subsequent assembly into regenerated PET)
that can operate under milder reaction conditions is an
attractive alternative, providing a strategy towards a more
sustainable, circular economy.
Although PET is particularly resistant to biodegradation,
3,4
a number of naturally occurring PET hydrolases have been
reported.5–8 Amongst these are cutinases from Fusarium
solani,9–12 a leaf-branch metagenome (LCC)6,13–15 and Humicola
insolens (HiC)11,16,17 as well as a hydrolase fromThermobida
fusca (TfH).9,10,18,19 In 2016, therst known bacterium capable of
using PET as its sole carbon source,Ideonella sakaiensis(Is), was
discovered.15 The authors identied a key enzyme (Is-PETase),
responsible for the hydrolysis of PET into bis(2-hydroxyethyl)
terephthalate (BHET), mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate
(MHET), terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG). They
also identied a secondary enzyme, MHETase, capable of
degrading intermediate MHET into TPA and EG (Scheme 1).
Recent interest has led to a surge in enzyme engineering studies
yielding variants with improved activities and thermal
stabilities.
20–28 For example, a machine learning designed
PETase with 4– 5 fold higher activity than other engineered PET
hydrolases has been reported.27 Untreated, post-consumer PET

plastics were almost fully degraded by the mutant (FAST-
PETase) within a week. Furthermore, they demonstrated
a closed-loop recycling system by the recovery of monomers,
highlighting the potential of degradative PETases in the
molecular recycling of PET.
Mechanochemical reactions are gaining traction as a green
method of performing organic synthesis, with a signicant
reduction in solvent usage. Recently, mechanochemistry has
been adopted in the biocatalytic sphere giving rise to mecha-
noenzymatic reactions.
29–33 A sustainable and eﬃcient strategy
for conducting various enzymatic transformations, the lack of
bulk solvent avoids problems due to the insolubility of
substrates, provides enzymes at high concentrations, and is
said to more closely mimic the natural environment ofin vivo
enzyme reactions than traditional biocatalytic reactions in
aqueous media.
34–39 Specically, the employment of liquid
assisted grinding (LAG) conditions, where the ratio of the liquid
volume to the mass of the solid reagents typically has an upper
limit of 2.0 mLm g−1, is proposed to better mimic the native
biological context in which microbe-secreted polymer degrad-
ing enzymes operate.
34,40 Reports of eﬃcient mechanoenzymatic
transformations include: the degradation of poorly soluble
natural polymers such as cellulose, lignocellulose and chitin
41,42
by proteases 37 and glycosyl hydrolases. 32,41–44 Methodology
coined reactive aging (RAging) has also been developed, where
substrates and enzymes are subjected to repeated cycles of ball
milling (reactive) followed by a period of incubation (aging),
allowing for reactions to cool down to avoid enzyme
denaturation.
41,42
Recent studies have highlighted the mechanoenzymatic
depolymerisation of PET using lyophilised HiC (Novozym ®
51032).17,45 In the HiC degradation of PET powder under‘moist-
solid’ conditions, short milling times were used followed by
long periods of aging, leading to good yields of TPA.17,45
Immobilised enzymes and non-immobilised puri ed
enzymes in solution or lysates are normally used for mecha-
noenzymatic reactions, for example, immobilised CALB has
been described together with RAging procedures.
46,47 In
a further development, whole cell mechanoenzymatic strategies
have been reported using transaminases under RAging condi-
tions. Signicantly increased yields of primary and secondary
amines from aldehydes and ketones were generated compared
to traditional solution reactions.
48 The use of whole cells has the
benet of simplifying the enzyme preparation process,
removing the need for cell lysis and enzyme purication. Action
of the ball mill can eﬀectively lyse the cellsin situ, and in a low
bulk solvent environment provides high enzyme concentra-
tions, which together with assisted grinding can promote the
reactions.
48,49
In this study, for therst time, whole cell PETase mecha-
noenzymatic hydrolytic approaches and the eﬀect of RAging on
the breakdown of BHET and PET have been investigated
(Scheme 1). This revealed signicant advantages over tradi-
tional large bulk solvent based hydrolytic enzymatic reactions,
with a marked increase in hydrolytic capability of a range of PET
hydrolases. It is ideally suited to the molecular recycling of
polymers such as PET, providing a proof-of-concept for future
mechanoenzymatic depolymerisation reactions, where indus-
trial process will necessarily use cell lysates due to the high costs
of enzyme purication.
Results and discussion
Enzyme selection
Initially six PETases with potentially interesting properties in
this system were selected (Table 1). These were,Is-PETase, Pol-
yangium brachysporum PETase (Pb-PETase), Acidovorax dela-
eldii PETase (Ad-PETase), Burkholderiales bacterium PETase
(Bb-PETase), and PET2 from an uncultured organism.25,28 For Is-
PETase, the S238F/W159H double mutant was used which was
shown to have an increased activity towards PET lm and
powder.
21,50 Pb-PETase and Bb-PETase have been used as puri-
ed enzymes for the degradation of PET.5,51,52 Sequence analysis
showed that the protein sequence ofBb-PETase was longer on
the N-terminus than other PETases (Fig. S1†) and a truncated
enzyme has been reported.52 Here, 141 amino-acid residues
were removed from the N-terminus, and the resulting subcl-
oned gene named shortBb-PETase. Ad-PETase has been high-
lighted as a potential PETase, and is known to degrade
poly(tetramethylene succinate), but to the best of our knowl-
edge it has not been described to degrade PET and was therefore
included.
25,53 Finally, PET2 from an uncultured marine bacte-
rium has been noted as thermophilic, which may be advanta-
geous in ball mill experiments. It has previously been screened
on agar plates against PET nanoparticles, as well as small scale
PET-lm degradation experiments.
5,28
All PETases were ordered as synthetic genes, subcloned with
the C-terminal His6-tag and expressed in the Shuﬄe T7 Express
strain. PETases are typically used as puried enzyme prepara-
tions; there are many fewer examples where enzyme lysates are
utilised.
27,55 Here, with development in mechanoenzymatic
reactions, all enzymes wererst used as cell-free lysates.
Initial small scale assays with BHET using enzyme lysates
Initial screens were carried out using BHET torst determine
the relative hydrolytic activity of the PETases, using enzyme
lysates. Diﬀerent reaction temperatures were selected as it is
widely reported that eﬃcient PET hydrolysis occurs at higher
temperatures,
56 due to its high glass transition temperature
(between 67 and 81 °C depending on crystallinity).57 Addition-
ally, as PET chemical recycling methods include both acid and
alkali hydrolysis,58 reactions were initially carried out at varying
pHs (6.0– 9.0). The full consumption of BHET was observed at
30 °C and pH 7.5 with four enzymes;Is-PETase S238F/W159H,
Pb-PETase, shortBb-PETase and PET2 (Fig. S5†). Much lower
conversions were observed forAd-PETase and Bb-PETase, and
both yielded only MHET. This likely reects the propensity of
Ad-PETase to degrade aliphatic polymers andBb-PETase has
been described to primarily degrade PET to MHET, rather than
TPA.52,53 While the background hydrolysis of BHET increased
between pH 6.0 and 9.0, generally no signicant eﬀect of pH on
enzyme activity was observed. At 50 °C, Ad-PETase and Bb-
PETase showed little if any activity above background levels,

Paper RSC Advances
while for Pb-PETase and short Bb-PETase yields (by HPLC)
dropped to 38% and 67% respectively.Is-PETase S238F/W159H
and PET2, both showed full conversion at 50 °C, with a slight
decrease in the yield of TPA forIs-PETase S238F/W159H. For
thermophilic PET2,5,28 the yield of TPA and MHET increased
with temperature. At 70 °C, BHET was fully hydrolysed in the
absence of enzyme, due to non-enzymatic hydrolysis.
Preliminary small scale PET assays
Small scale assays were then carried out using the four most
active PETases: Is-PETase S238F/W159H, Pb-PETase, shortBb-
PETase and PET2. Total protein expression levels varied (0.16–
0.45 mg protein per mg whole cell) with PETases produced at up
to 18% total protein present (see ESI 1.3†). PET2 was expressed
at notably lower levels. PETlms are produced in a range of
thicknesses and crystallinities leading to variable results, so
commercial PET powder (Goodfellow, 300 microns, >48%
crystallinity) was used to characterise the enzymes. Negative
controls were carried out using a whole cell BL21 empty vector
(ev) (comparison experiments with a whole cell SHuﬄeT 7
empty vector strain also showed no degradation in solution).
Reactions were completed in triplicate, at 1 mg mL
−1 and 4 mg
mL−1 concentrations of PET powder, and varying pHs to
determine whether the degradation prole was similar to that
with BHET. Initial reactions for 24 h showed little if any
degradation. For this reason, and following literature prece-
dent, reactions were carried out for 96 h at 30 °C (Fig. 1a and
S6†).
15,50 Is-PETase S238F/W159H was shown to be the most
active at pH 9.0, as was PET2.5 A pH of 7.5 proved to be best for
Pb-PETase and shortBb-PETase which had similar activities.
Interestingly little BHET was observed, with TPA being the
major breakdown product in all cases at pH 7.5 (above 80% of
the breakdown products were TPA), and a higher proportion of
MHET was detected at pH 9.0. However, across all the enzymes,
the most extensive degradation to TPA was observed at pH 7.5.
Negative controls showed no degradation.
Recently, the addition of 10% DMSO to PETase reactions has
been observed to increase the depolymerisation of amorphous
PET lm.
50 Reactions were therefore also carried out with 10%
DMSO (Fig. 1b). For PET2,Pb-PETase and shortBb-PETase, no
diﬀerence in degradation activity was observed, possibly due to
the higher crystallinity PET powder used here compared to
amorphous PETlm used in the literature. Additionally, S238F/
W159H PETase activity appeared to be inhibited by 10% DMSO,
further highlighting that DMSO was not benecial.
Mechanoenzymatic BHET breakdown
Mechanoenzymatic reactions with BHET using whole cell
PETases and ball milling were explored in tandem with tradi-
tional biocatalytic solution reactions to better understand the
eﬀect of milling on the reaction.
This was attempted as enhancements have been seen in
other hydrolytic reactions and more recently transaminase
reactions with whole cells.
17,36–39,41–44,48 It was also considered
that lysing the cellsin situto release the enzymesvia mechanical
milling might be benecial.48 For polymer-assisted grinding it
has been stated that having more matter inside the jars can
promote reactions, so inert additives in the form of cell debris
might also aid the reaction.
43 RAging cycles were employed to
mitigate against enzyme denaturation due to increased
temperatures from mechanical forces.
41,42,44
The four PETases were used as lyophilised whole cells with
BHET in solution reactions at 30 °C and pH 7.5. In agreement
with earlier results, the most active PETase was Is-PETase
S238F/W159H, with nearly 80% yields (by HPLC) aer 8 h
(Fig. 2a). Interestingly, Pb-PETase exhibited slightly lower
activity than shortBb-PETase. The proportion of TPA generated
by shortBb-PETase was higher than withPb-PETase, consistent
with the small scale lysate reactions with BHET (Fig. S5†). PET2
exhibited low levels of degradation. With all enzymes, MHET
was the predominant breakdown product, and the levels of
degradation were promising. In the environment, PETases are
secreted where they degrade PET extracellularly. It is likely that
BHET, as a small molecule, can be taken up by the PETase
secreting cells, resulting in hydrolysis in the absence of cell
lysis. Little degradation was observed in the negative control.
Mechanoenzymatic reactions were then carried out with 8
RAging cycles of 20 min milling supplemented by 40 min aging,
under LAG conditions (Fig. 2b). Again,Is-PETase S238F/W159H
exhibited the highest amount of BHET degradation, followed by
shortBb-PETase, Pb-PETase then PET2, with a similar propor-
tion of degradation to TPA observed across S238F/W159H,Pb-
and shortBb-PETases, as in solution. The negative control, ev,
exhibited higher degradation levels than PET2, suggesting
a mechanochemical eﬀect. To explore the particulate-grinding
eﬀect on BHET it was subjected to the milling process on its
own. Low levels of hydrolysis were seen, with some MHET
formed. Overall, the low levels of BHET breakdown in the
mechanoenzymatic reactions compared to in solution, was
rationalised as probably due to the enzymes being denatured.

Mechanoenzymatic PETase reactions
PET degradation reactions were then carried out using PET
powder under mechanoenzymatic conditions. Hammereret al.
have recently reported increased yields of enzymatic hydrolysis
of microcrystalline cellulose with RAging cycles of 5 min milling
followed by 55 min aging.
41 Similarly, recent reports of mecha-
noenzymatic PET degradation by HiC also employed a short
RAging cycle of 5 min milling, 7 days aging.
17,45 A key diﬀerence
here is our use of whole cell enzymes, and it was considered that
more RAging cycles would be necessary to lyse the cellsin situ.
To therefore assess the best RAging cycle for the mecha-
noenzymatic hydrolysis of PET, reactions comprising 200 mg
PET powder and 50 mg lyophilised whole cell PETase were
subjected to RAging cycles of either 5, 10, 20 or 30 min milling
followed by 55, 50, 40 or 30 min aging, respectively (Fig. 3a).
Aer 8 h of RAging (i.e. 8 × the above cycles) the products
appeared as a paste (Fig. 3b). HPLC analysis indicated the
release of degradation products when subjected to RAging
cycles with all enzymes, other than PET2. Interestingly, TPA was
the major product for all PETases, accounting for 100% of the
product with active enzymes using 5 min milling, and across all
the milling times with shortBb-PETase. Is-PETase S238F/W159H
exhibited the highest level of degradation, consistent with
previous reactions, with 20 min milling and 40 min aging giving
the highest yields. Similar levels of TPA were observed with the
10 and 20 min milling RAging cycles, but increased levels of
MHET were detected with 20 min. It was thought that the
decrease in yield for Is-PETase S238F/W159H with 30 min
milling may be due to the enzyme denaturing. Pb-PETase
showed similar levels of degradation across each RAging cycle,
with a slightly higher proportion of MHET formed aer 20 and
30 min milling cycles.
PET2 with PET powder showed no degradation. Mecha-
noenzymatic reactions were therefore repeated with a longer
reaction time of 24 h, using both puried and lysate PET2, as
degradation had been previously observed with lysate in the
small scale assay (4 mg mL
−1 PET powder and 1 mg mL−1
PETase aer 96 h). Activity was conrmed with good levels of
breakdown products observed (Fig. S8 †) at lower substrate
loadings (50 mg PET) with puried enzyme. At higher substrate
loadings (200 mg) and claried lysate (from 50 mg lyophilised
whole cells), only trace amounts of MHET and TPA were formed.

Paper RSC Advances
Clearly the relatively low enzyme expression of PET2 (ESI 1.3
and Fig. S2†) had an impact on the level of degradation and
substrate loading is also important.
Investigations into substrate–enzyme loading
To establish the optimal ratio of whole cell PETases used to the
amount of PET substrate used, the quantity of PETase whole
cells was increased from 50 mg to 200 mg (1 : 1 w/w), and sub-
jected to mechanoenzymatic treatment, with a T = 20 min
milling time selected as it had previously given good results.
However, product analysis proved problematic, as the mixture
formed was diﬃcult to solubilise. Therefore, to balance the
amount of solid material in the milling jars, the quantity of PET
powder was decreased to 100 mg and 50 mg (2 : 1 w/w and 1 : 1
w/w, PET powder : PETase). This still adhered to LAG condi-
tions, with the value ofh equalling the upper limit of 2.0mL
mg
−1, rather than 1.5mLm g−1. The yield of breakdown prod-
ucts increased nearly 4-fold when compared with using 200 mg
PET powder starting material (Fig. 3c). This did not arise from
increased background degradation due to the action of the
milling (see negative control, ev).
PET degradation using PETases in solution
To highlight the eﬀect of using the ball mill over traditional
biocatalytic reactions, as well as carrying out solution reactions
with whole cells for direct comparison with mechanoenzymatic
reactions, solution reactions with freshly prepared cell lysates
were performed. Comparability between the amount of enzyme
in each of the solution reactions was ensured by resuspending
and lysing 50 mg of whole cells. Cell lysate is oen used in
biocatalytic reactions, avoiding the protein purication step,
and saving on labour, cost and time. Both whole cell and lysate
solution reactions with 50 mg PET powder (4 mg mL
−1 substrate
concentration), based on the small scale assays, yielded no
degradation, highlighting the positive eﬀect of the ball mill and
whole cell enzymes in the mechanoenzymatic system. The

concentration of PET was increased to 10 mg mL−1 (along with
increasing the enzyme concentration) by scaling down the
volume of buﬀer to highlight the hydrolytic capability of PETase
lysates in traditional biocatalytic solution reactions (Fig. 3e).
The lack of degradation for solution reactions compared to
the successful mechanoenzymatic PET breakdown observed,
suggests that the ball milling is an essential feature here for the
hydrolysis of PET. Combined with the lower levels of breakdown

observed in the mechanoenzymatic negative controls, this
strongly suggests that an additive eﬀect is observed between the
PETase and the ball milling technique which causes PET
degradation.
Other PET materials
In order to show the feasibility of utilising this method more
generally, other forms of PET were tested. There are far fewer
reports in the literature of using PET powder to date, most
experimentation thus far has used PETlm. A sample of PET
lm (Goodfellow, 0.25 mm thickness, 40– 60% crystallinity) was
therefore used to compare with PET powder, as well as a post-
consumer PET drinks bottle sample (0.15 mm thickness) and
some recycled PET (RPET (thick) 0.30 mm thickness) from
a post-consumer yoghurt pot. The threelms were prepared
(6 mm discs), washed with soapy water, water and ethanol, then
dried overnight. The conditions used wereT = 20 min milling
(40 min aging, 8 cycles), 50 mg substrate and 50 mg whole cell
PETase. Again, Is-PETase S238F/W159H exhibited the highest
degradation across all the materials, except for RPET (thick)
which was degraded most fully byPb-PETase (Fig. 4a). Indeed,
only partially broken-down discs were isolated aer 8 h, in
contrast to the other PETlms which formed a smooth paste
with nolm remaining. RPET may contain other contaminants
and it may be possible thatPb-PETase can tolerate such impu-
rities more readily. The thickness of the material will also be an
important factor.
To explore this, a thinner post-consumer food packaging
RPET sample (RPET (thin) 0.19 mm thickness) was tested and
Is-PETase S238F/W159H then exhibited similar levels of degra-
dation to PET powder. PET powder was more readily degraded
than most of thelms (only RPET (thin) was similar), which
may have been due to the smaller particle size, despite the
higher crystallinity (in comparison to the Goodfellow PETlm).
The enzyme showing the most consistent tolerance towards the
PET materials and proportionately fullest degradation to TPA
was short Bb-PETase, reecting the previous experiments with
BHET and PET. Overall, these results highlighted a good
performance for the PETases under mechanoenzymatic condi-
tions with a range of PET materials. Solution reactions with
whole cells were carried out for comparison purposes, and in all
cases no degradation was detected.
Carrying forward the optimised conditions and using the
best performingIs-PETase S238F/W159H, two samples of RPET
fabric (Table 2) were also subjected to mechanoenzymatic
degradation (Fig. 4b and c). Fabric 1 was degraded more readily
than all of the materials tested, with a with a yield of over 4.0
mmol and a 6.5-fold increase compared with the ev control.
Similarly, fabric 2 was also well degraded with a combined TPA
and MHET yield of over 2.20mmol. In comparison with the
equivalent solution lysate reactions, carried out at 10 mg mL
−1
based on previous PET powder solution reactions, the mecha-
noenzymatic process gave a 27-fold increase in yield for the
degradation of fabric 1 and a 20-fold increase for the degrada-
tion of fabric 2 (Fig. 4b). The appearance of the fabrics before
and aer degradation is shown in Fig. 4c.
Other recent PET hydrolases
Based on the eﬃciency of recent literature PET hydrolases that
can eﬀectively break down amorphous and semi-crystalline PET
substrates when used as puri ed enzyme, a couple were
selected for further mechanoenzymatic reactions using the
reaction conditions developed. Interestingly, while the overall
combined yields of TPA and MHET did not increase, a signi-
cant increase in degradation between comparable solution
reactions and mechanoenzymatic reactions against the SHuﬄe
ev control was again observed, with a 26-fold increase for Hot-
PETase
55 and a 10-fold increase for LCC-ICCG6 (Fig. 4d). This
again highlighted the advantages of applying the PETases
mechanoenzymatically.
To buﬀer or not
As anal note, the small scale PET powder assays highlighted
that for bothIs-PETase S238F/W159H and PET2, pH 9.0 buﬀer
enabled a higher degradation of PET. To see if this inuenced
the mechanoenzymatic reaction, pH 9.0 buﬀer was used. For
both Is-PETase S238F/W159H and PET2, a 15% and 20%
increase in yield was observed, respectively (Fig. S10 †). To
demonstrate that the observed increase was not purely a result
of the higher basicity of the KPi buﬀer, a negative control with
whole cell ev was performed. For the pH 7.5 and pH 9.0 controls,
there was a decrease in yield of just over 5%, conrming a pH
eﬀect with the PETase. Further to this, PET powder breakdown
using Is-PETase S238F/W159H was explored replacing KPi
buﬀer with deionised water, providing comparable levels of
degradation to the pH 7.5 reaction. This highlighted another
advantage of the system developed, removing the need for
buﬀers, which could potentially aid the green chemistry prole.
Conclusions
In summary, we report the rst use of whole cell PETase
enzymes to breakdown a variety of PET materials (including
post-consumer samples) and BHET using mechanoenzymatic
ball milling. The activity of a shortBb-PETase was also explored
with several forms of PET and highlighted that a more complete
conversion to TPA was possible than the other PETases explored
(consistently above 75% of the total product formed). An addi-
tive eﬀect between the ball milling technique and PETase action
was demonstrated to breakdown PET where comparable tradi-
tional biocatalytic reactions in aqueous solutions with whole
cell enzymes or lysate were signicantly less eﬀective. This
simplication in the preparation of the enzyme is notable,
particularly as most reported PETases to date are used as
puried enzymes. While the use of whole cells, due to the lower
amounts of enzymes, results in lower TPA yields compared to
literature reports, it highlights a valuable approach which can
be applied on larger scales where the costs of enzyme puri-
cation are prohibitive.
Benets of the mechanoenzymatic breakdown of PET
include: a signicant reduction in solvent usage, approximately
30-fold when compared with the leading large scale industrial
PET breakdown system
6 and 2600-fold when compared with the

current leading PETase hydrolysis of PET27 (56 mL solvent per
nmol and 5 mL solvent per nmolversus 1.9 mL per nmol in this
work). Some ball milling is already used in industrial settings to
breakdown PET for secondary recycling, enhancing the feasi-
bility of upscaling this process with PETases in the future.
Yields of breakdown products were increased by implementa-
tion of a 1 : 1 w/w substrate to whole cell PETase ratio, under
LAG conditions, even in water. We are now exploring this
methodology with other PETases and tackling PETase expres-
sion levels. It is hoped that in the future mechanoenzymatic
processes could oﬀer a solution to the single-use plastic waste
crisis and aid the transition towards a circular economy.
