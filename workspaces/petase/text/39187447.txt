Introduction
Plastics are synthetic polymers with the advantages of chemical resistance, lightweightness, and cost-
effectiveness. Their ubiquitous utilization on a global  scale since the 1950s unders cores their pivotal role in
contemporary daily existence [1]. Worldwide, plastic pollution has become a global environmental issue. Every
year, over 350 million tons of plastic are produced globally for a wide range of applications [2]. Billions of tons of
plastic waste in landfills, floating in trash islands in the ocean, and scattered as microplastics have led to severe
global pollution [3]. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET ) is a condensation polymer formed by an ester bond
between ethylene glycol (EG) and terephthalic acid (TPA) [4]. Due to its transparency, flexibility, and resistance to
natural degradation, PET is one of the most widely employed plastic products with various applications used in
everyday life, including the production of beverage bottles and textiles [5]. However, a large amount of PET waste
has accumulated in the environment and caused severe environmental problems [6].
Bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) is a commercially available monomer that closely resembles the core
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), one of the most wi dely used plastics in the world, causes serious
environmental problems. Recently, scientists have  been focused on the enzymatic degradation of
PET, an environmentally friendly method that offers an attractive  approach to the degradation and
recycling of PET. In this work, PET hydrolase from Streptomyces  sp. W2061 was biochemically
characterized, and the biodegradation of PET wa s performed using the PET model substrate bis (2-
hydroxyethyl terephthalate) (BHET). PET hydrolase has an isoelectric point of 5.84, and a molecular
mass of about 50.31 kDa. The optimum pH and temp erature were 7.0 and 40°C, respectively. LC-MS
analysis of the enzymatic products showed that the PET hydrolase successfully degraded a single
ester bond of BHET, leading to the formation of MHET . Furthermore, in silico characterization of the
PET hydrolase protein sequence and its predicte d three-dimensional structure was designed and
compared with the well-characterized IsPETase from Ideonella  sakaiensis . The structural analysis
showed that the (Gly-x1-Ser-x2-Gly) serine hydrolas e motif and the catalytic triad (Ser, Asp, and His)
were conserved in all sequences. In addition, we integrated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to
analyze the variation in the structural stability of  the PET hydrolase in the absence and presence of
BHET. These simulations showed the formation of a stable complex between the PET hydrolase and
BHET. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study on Streptomyces sp. W2061 to investigate
the BHET degradation activity of PET hydrolase, which has potential application in the
biodegradation of plastics in the environment.

structure of PET and has been used extensively in PET research [7]. In the enzymatic hydrolysis of PET, BHET and
MHET were detected as intermediates, while TPA and EG were identified as end products [8, 9]. The conventional
method for recycling PET is associated with high energy consumption and typically produces harmful by-
products, using both physical and chemical processes [10] . T h e  e n z y m e  i s o l a t e d  f r o m  m i c r o o r g a n i s m s  h a s
provided a novel and eco-friendly option for the development of biodegradation strategies [11]. Modern
technology can not only alleviate the problem of plastic waste accumulation, but also reclaim the raw materials
necessary for recycled plastics [12]. In recent years, it has been reported that certain microorganisms, such as
Fusarium oxysporum, Fusarium solani, Thermomyces insolens, Thermobifida alba,  Bacillus subtilis , and
Penicillium citrinum, have shown the ability to degrade PET by using it as their primary carbon and energy source
for cell growth [13-16]. The genus Streptomyces, which belongs to the Actinomycetes group, is well known to
produce compounds and enzymes of ecological, industrial, and clinical interest [17–20]. The enzymes best known
for their PET-hydrolyzing ability are serine hydrolases, which include carboxylesterases, cutinases, lipases and
esterases [21]. PET hydrolase (IsPETase) from Ideonella sakaiensis [22] and cutinase from leaf-branch compost
(LCC) [23, 24] are the most extensively studied PET-active enzymes and can therefore be considered as model
PET hydrolases. All of these enzymes share a common catalytic triad (S-D-H) and utilize a similar reaction
mechanism, but each subfamily exhibits unique substrate recognition properties [25]. Structural analyses have
shown that PET hydrolase belongs to the α/β- hydrolase superfamily with the canonical α/β- hydrolase fold,
comprising a central β-sheet flanked by α-helices [26]. In 2016, Y oshida et al. discovered a bacterium, I. sakaiensies
201-F6, capable of breaking down PET as an energy source using novel secreted enzymes, IsPETase and mono(2-
hydroxyethyl) terephthalate hydrolase (MHETase) [22]. The enzymatic reaction mechanism of IsPETase has been
studied more extensively than that of other PET h ydrolases [27]. H owever , the degradation activities of PET
hydrolases are still very weak due to the mobility of PET polymer chains, the specificity of their active sites, and the
necessity for the relatively high temperature [24]. In the current research, we sought to identify a PET hydrolase in
Streptomyces sp. W2061. The activity of the enzyme was confirmed by heterologous expression in Escherichia coli,
demonstrating its ability to degrade BHET. Furthermore, in silico approaches combining homology modeling,
docking, and MD simulations were used to investigate the flexibility of the catalytic site for substrate binding, and
aid in understanding the BHET degradation activity.
Materials and Methods
Strains and Reagents
Bacterial strain Streptomyces sp. W2061 was obtained from the Chemical Biology Research Center (KRIBB,
Republic of Korea). PET was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (China), BHET was obtained from Sigma-Aldrich
(Japan), and TPA was purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. (Japan). DNA polymerase, restriction
enzymes, and T-vector and T4 DNA ligase were purchased from Clontech Takara (Japan). All other analytical-
grade chemicals used in this study were obtained from available commercial sources.
Protein Homology Search and Phylogeny Analysis
A protein homology search was performed by using protein BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi). A
total of 16 potential PET hydrolase homologous protein sequences were identified from the RCSB PDB database
(http://www.rcsb.org) [28]. ClustalW was used for protein sequence alignment and phylogeny analysis was
performed by using MEGA11 [29]. The software ESPript 3 (http://espript.ibcp.fr) [30] was used for multiple
sequence alignment of proteins. Expasy proteomics server (https://web.expasy.org/protparam) [31] was used to
calculate the theoretical molecular mass and isoelectric point (pI) of the PET hydrolase. The percentage identity
and similarity of PET hydrolase with similar enzymes were calculated by using the Emboss Needle pair alignment
tool (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/psa/emboss_needle) [32].
Protein Structure Analysis, Modeling, and Molecular Docking
In silico protein structure prediction was performed by using the online web-server SWISS-MODEL [33].
Molecular docking experiments were performed using AutoDock Vina, and the results were visualized by Pymol
[34, 35] and Ligplot+ [36]. For the docking, the model substrate BHET (Zinc database ID: ZINC02040111) was
used as the ligand [37]. BHET has already been used in molecular docking studies as a model substrate for PET
degradation, using both in vitro and in silico approaches [38].
Molecular Dynamics Simulation
The MD simulation for PET hydrolase alone and PET hydrolase–BHET complex were performed using
GROMACS package [39]. Both systems were prepared using CHARMM36m force field [40] and TIP3P water
[41]. The parameters of CHARMM36m force field for BHET were taken from CGenFF server [42]. Both systems
emerged in a cubic box containing specific numbers of water molecules (13,794 for PET hydrolase alone) and
(13,792 for PET hydrolase–BHET complex), for which the distance of protein from the edge of the box was kept at
1.0 nm. To preserve the overall neutrality, each system was supplemented with the required number of
counterions (Na
+ and Cl–) along with the concentration of 0.15 M NaCl [43]. Each system was then subjected to
energy minimization utilizing the steepest descent method followed by equilibration for 500 ps under NVT and
NPT conditions. Both equilibrated systems were then  subjected to MD simulations of 100 ns each, while
upholding a target pressure of 1 bar with Parinello-Rahman barostat [44], and a temperature at 310 K using a
Nose-Hoover thermostat [45]. The LINCS algorithm was applied to constrain all the bonds [46], while the bonds

within the water molecules were constrained by the SETTLE algorithm [47]. The long-range electrostatic and
short-range van der Waals interactions were computed employing the particle mesh Ewald (PME) method, with a
short-range interaction cut-off value of 1.2 nm [48].
After the completion of the 100 ns MD simulations, trajectories were analyzed using various GROMACS
utilities for structural stability analyses through root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) and root-mean-square
fluctuations (RMSF) using the gmx rms and gmx rmsf modules. The conformational clustering was carried out
using the Daura et al. algorithm [49] with the gmx cluster utility of GROMACS at an RMSD cut-off value of
0.12 nm. Lastly, binding free energy was calculated using the molecular mechanics Poisson-Boltzmann surface
area (MM-PBSA) method employing g_mmpbsa [50]. During the binding free energy calculation, the entropy
calculation was not considered, in accordance with previous studies [51].
Cloning and Heterologous Expression
The full length of the PET hydrolase gene from Streptomyces sp. W2061 (GenBank Accession No. 030719063.1)
was designed by (Geno-Tech, Republic of Korea). The PET hydrolase was amplified by polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) using the primers (forward): 5 ‐GAATTC
 ATG CAG CAG CAC CTC CCC T‐3 (EcoRI restriction site
underlined), and (reverse): 5‐AAGCTT TCG GCT CTA CGC CGT GTG‐3 (HindIII restriction site underlined).
The amplified PCR product (951 bp) was ligate d into the T-vector and transformed into E. coli XL1-Blue.
Subsequently, both the cloned plasmid and pET-32a (+) plasmid were double digested with EcoRI and HindIII
and ligated using T4 DNA ligase. The presence of insert was verified via Sanger sequencing T7 promoter and T7
terminator primers. The resulting recombinant plasmid was then transformed into E. coli BL21(DE3) cells. For
protein overexpression, a positively transformed colony was picked and grown in lysogeny LB broth containing
100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37
oC, until the cell density at OD600 reached approximately 0.6~0.7. Protein expression
was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl-β-D thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) and cells were incubated at -20oC for 24 h.
The induced cell pellets (from a 200 ml culture) were collected by centrifugation for 30 min at 3,500 ×g at 4oC,
washed twice with 50 mM Tris-HCL buffer (pH 8.0), and stored at -50oC for further use. 
For purification, the induced cells were resuspended in 8 ml Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0) and disrupted using
ultrasonic treatment for 15 min with 5 s pulses and 20 s pauses, using an ultrasonic homogenizer (Ulsso HiTech
Co., Ltd., Republic of Korea). The ce ll extract was centrifuged at 11,000 × g for 25 min at 4 oC and the soluble
fraction was applied to 2 ml Talon metal affinity resin (Takara), and incubated for 2 h at 4oC. The bound protein
was poured into a gravity flow column, washed with 20 ml of Trish-HCl (pH 8.0) buffer, and eluted with different
fractions of the imidazole (10, 100, and 200 mM) containing Trish-HCl (pH 8.0). The eluted protein was
concentrated using Amicon centrifugal filters (Millipore, 30kDa). The purity of the protein was analyzed by 15%
SDS-PAGE, and the protein concentration was measured by Bradford protein assay [52].
Enzymatic Activity Assay
The purified protein (50 nM) was incubated in 500 μl Tris-HCl buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.0) containing
4 mM BHET for 18 h at 30
oC. The reaction was terminated by heating at 80 oC for 10 min, filtered through a
0.22 μm Whatman filter (Henke-Ject, Germany) and subsequently analyzed by HPLC. All samples were processed
in triplicate, with the reaction mixture containing boiled protein considered a negative control.
HPLC and LC-MS Analysis
The HPLC analysis was conducted on a Dionex UltiMate 3000 Diode Array Detector (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Japan) with a Mightysil Reverse-Phase Analytical Column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 μm). The mobile phase (A) was TFA
water (0.05%) and acetonitrile (B). The gradient elution program was set as follows: 30-65% (v/v) acetonitrile from 0
to 25 min, and 65-100% acetonitrile from 25 to 35 min, with an optimal flow rate of 1.0 ml/min. Each sample was
injected with a volume of 20 μl, and the temperature of the column and detector was maintained at 30
oC. The
effluent was detected at 260 nm. LC-MS analysis wa s carried out using a liquid chromatography mass-
spectrometer (UPLC, SYNAPT G2-S/ACQUITY , USA) in positive ion mode.
Effects of pH, Temperature Metal Ions and Organic Solvents on Enzyme Activity
The impact of pH, temperature, organic solvents, and metal ions on enzyme activity was studied using the
model substrate para-nitrophenol (p-NPC4). The total reaction volume was 2 ml, which included 120 μl of 10 mM
(p-NPC4) substrate, 1.68 ml of 50 mM (Tris-HCl, pH 7), and 200 μl of purified PET hydrolase. After a 120-min
reaction at 40oC, the production of (p-NPC4) was measured at 405 nm. One unit of PET hydrolase was defined as
the amount of enzyme that produced 1 μmol of p-nitrophenol per minute.
Under the standard assay conditions, the stability of PET hydrolase was examined across pH levels (4.0-10.0)
using the following buffers: 50 mM/L sodium acetate buffer pH (4.0-5.0), citrate phosphate buffer pH (5.0-6.0),
sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.0-8.0), Tris-HCl buffer pH (8.0-9.0), and glycine-NaOH buffer pH (9.0-10.0).
Additionally, the optimal temperature for PET hydrolase activity was determined by evaluating enzyme activity at
different temperatures between 20oC and 70oC.
Moreover, the influence of different metal ions and organic solvents on the PET hydrolase activity was
investigated, based on various metal ions Na+ (NaCl), K+ (KCl), NH4
+ (NH4Cl), Mg2+ (MgCl2), Ba2+ (BaCl2), Zn2+
(ZnCl2), Fe2+ (FeCl2), and Cu 2+ (CuSO4) at a final concentration of 1 mM, and organic solvents (methanol,
acetonitrile, ethyl acetate, Tween 20, DMSO, and EDTA) in a volume concentration of 1.0%. The enzyme activity
without the addition of metal ions or organic solvents served as a control.

Results and Discussion
Protein Homology Search and Phylogeny Analysis
By applying a sequence similarity search approach using the protein BLAST, the Streptomyces PETase (PET
hydrolase)-encoding gene had a molecular weight of 50.31 kDa (GenBank accession no. WP 030719063.1)
(Fig. S1), and its theoretical isoelectric point (pI) value was 5.84. A total of 16 potential PET hydrolase
homologous proteins were identified from the RCSB PDB database. These proteins were used for phylogenetic
analysis using MEGA11. The amino acid sequences were aligned with ClustalW [53], and a maximum likelihood
phylogenetic tree was generated with 1,000 bootstrap replicates with a cut-off value of 50%, as shown in (Fig. 1). It
appears that all enzymes in the tree had a common ancestral origin, except for cutinase (7QJP). There are 4 clades,
and our PET hydrolase was closely related to the lipase (1JFR) of Streptomyces exfoliates (Fig. 1). Using
InterProScan and Pfam, the PET hydrolase was identifi ed as a member of the α/β hydrolase family. Most
polyesterases belong to this superfamily, which includes enzymes that have similar structures but perform a
variety of functions [54].
The amino acid sequences of the PET hydrolase were homologous to lipase (1JFR) from Streptomyces exfoliatus,
which has 78.8% identity and 81.3% similarity. The lowest identity (48.4%) and similarity (58.4%) were found with
a PET hydrolase (4CG1) from Thermobifida fusca (Table S1). There was 55.1% identity and 64.7% similarity with
cutinase Est119 (3VIS) from Thermobifida alba, and 56.3% identity and 66.2% similarity with an alpha-beta-
hydrolase (7YKQ) from Thermomonospora curvata DSM (Table S1). These differences in the degrees of similarity
of these PET hydrolases indicate the presence of structural adaptation elements of the enzymes to ensure a balance
between their activity, stability, and flexibility required for catalysis [55]
Multiple sequence alignments were employed to identify the conserved regions, motifs, and active sites of the
enzyme, based on sequence comparisons with other PET hydrolases. The MSA of the PET hydrolase revealed a
typical catalytic triad consisting of Ser-Asp-His, which was to be expected as this triad is known to be essential for

the built-in CLUSTALW (default parameters), and the tree was built using the neighbor-joining method with default
parameters and 1,000 bootstrap replications.

the enzymatic activity of this enzyme class. A consensus motif (G‐X‐S‐X‐G) was identified around the serine in
the active site (Fig. 2). Serine acts as a nucleophilic center for the hydrolysis of ester, amide, or thioester bonds. The
histidine residue serves as a general base or acid, while the carboxylate group of aspartic acid helps to properly
orient and neutralize the charge of the imidazole ring of histidine [56]. The deprotonated catalytic serine attacks
the carbonyl bond of the substrate, leading to the cleavage of one of the acyl–oxygen bonds [57].
Protein 3D Structure Prediction and Molecular Docking
The conformation of a protein plays a crucial role in determining its function and stability [58]. To gain a deeper
understanding of the possible functional characteristics and structural arrangement of the PET hydrolase protein,
an in silico prediction of its three-dimensional structure was performed using SWISS-MODEL. The lipase from
Streptomyces exfoliates (PDB ID: 1JFR) was used as a template for model prediction. The generated model has a
GMQE score and QMEN Z-score of 0.78 and -0.04, resp ectively, which indicates a reliable predicted model
(Fig. 3B). When compared to the structure of IsPETase (Fig. 3A), the predicted structure of the PET hydrolase
shows many similarities. Both belong to the same α/β-hydrolase superfamily and have 9 β-sheets and 7 α-helices
[59]. The configuration of the catalytic triad was also similar, as highlighted in Fig. 3A and 3B, which may partially
explain the activity of these enzymes in the degradat ion of synthetic polyesters. Regarding the potential
differences observed between these two protein structures, the most striking differences were the lack of a
disulfide bond and an extended loop between α6 and β8 in our PET hydrolase [7].
To anticipate how the protein binds with the ligand, a molecular docking experiment was performed using a
predicted model of the PET hydrolase and the ligand BHET with the program AutoDock Vina. The poses of the
most favored conformation of BHET showed a binding energy of ≤ -5.1 kcal/mol, which was similar to those
previously described in similar molecular docking ex periments with IsPETase and BHET [18]. The binding
modes were analyzed in detail using PyMOL software. The optimal mode with the lowest binding energy (Fig. 3C)
displays the hydrogen bond interactions between the residues [F61 (2.6 Å), T62 (2.2 Å), S129 (2.5 Å), W154 (2.0 Å,
2.7 Å), and V177 (2.9 Å)] of the PET hydrolase and BH ET, which are shown in the docked pose of the PET
hydrolase–BHET complex. The 2D interaction map was generated using Ligplot+, which depicted the

outcomes of protein structure and molecular docking analysis reinforce the significant potential of the PET
hydrolase enzyme in plastic degradation. Additionally, these analyses shed light on the specific structural
characteristics that enable and enhance its enzymatic activity in this regard.
Diversity in the Structural Stability of PET Hydrolase in the Absence and Presence of BHET
The relative structural stability of the PET hydrolase alone and the PET hydrolase–BHET complex was
illuminated using the structural parameters RMSD and RMSF . The average RMSD for the PET hydrolase alone
was noted to be 0.157 ± 0.002 nm, while the average RMSD of the PET hydrolase–BHET complex oscillates at a
significantly lower value (0.105 ± 0.001 nm) during simulation (Fig. 4A). The lower average RMSD of the PET
hydrolase–BHET complex indicated the higher structure stability of the PET hydrolase in the presence of BHET as
compared to the PET hydrolase alone.
The average RMSF for the PET hydrolase alone and the PET hydrolase–BHET complex was noted to be 0.069 ±
0.003 nm and 0.053 ± 0.002 nm, respectively (Fig. 4B). The RMSF analysis displayed lower fluctuations in ~93%
residues of the PET hydrolase on the incorporation of BHET. The RMSF analysis illuminated reduced fluctuations
in the residues N1–N11, E15–T47, G50–P59, F61, I68–L151, G153–T159, E162–L200, A205–T259 of the PET
hydrolase on the inclusion of BHET. Notably, the reduced fluctuation in the residues of the PET hydrolase on the
incorporation of BHET resulted in the lower flexibility and higher structural stability of the PET hydrolase.
In addition, we conducted a visual inspection of the conformational snapshots for the PET hydrolase alone and
the PET hydrolase–BHET complex (Fig. 4C and 4D). Th e conformational snapshots extracted at various time
points (0, 50, and 100 ns) from MD trajectories highlighted that BHET remained strongly bound to the binding
site of the PET hydrolase during the whole simulation, and its binding was also predicted in the molecular docking
studies (Fig. 4D).
Impact of BHET on the Conformational Analyses of PET Hydrolase
The conformational clustering was conducted to anticipate the thermodynamic stability of the PET hydrolase
alone and the PET hydrolase–BHET complex. In PET hydrolase alone, the percentage populations of the three
most populated clusters (Cluster–1, Cluster–2, Cluster–3) were observed at 17.95, 9.75, and 8.2%, respectively
(Fig. S2A). However, the percentage increased to 34.25, 10.85, and 9.25% for Cluster–1, Cluster–2, and Cluster–3,
respectively, for the PET hydrolase on incorporating BHET (Fig. S2B). The top three clusters comprised 35.9% of
the entire conformational ensemble in the PET hydrolase alone, whereas 64.35% of conformations were sampled
Fig. 4. The RMSD and RMSF plots of PET hydrolase alone and PET hydrolase–BHET complex are shown in
panels A and B. The conformational snapshots at various time points (0, 50, and 100 ns) for PET hydrolase alone and PET
hydrolase–BHET complex are shown underneath (panels C and D, respectively).

in the three most-populated clusters of the PET hydrolase–BHET complex. Thus, the inclusion of BHET results in
enhanced conformational uniformity within the PET hydrolase structure. The conformational clustering
outcomes suggest the heightened thermodynamic stabil ity in the PET hydrolase-BHET complex compared to
PET hydrolase alone.
Binding Free Energy Calculation between PET Hydrolase and BHET
BHET exhibited a robust binding to the PET hydrolase with a binding free energy of –37.4 ± 3.4 kcal/mol
(Table 1). Notably, the van der Waals (ΔE
vdW) interaction energy became a governing force in the binding of BHET
to the PET hydrolase (–21.3 ± 1.7 kcal/mol). The electrostatic energy, ΔEele (–6.6 ± 1.3 kcal/mol) and non-polar
solvation energy, ΔGnps (–25.5 ± 4.3 kcal/mol), favorably contributed to the total binding free energy, whereas the
polar solvation energy, Δ Gps (16.0 ± 3.9 kcal/mol), was unfavorable in the binding of BHET with the PET
hydrolase. The residue-wise binding free-energy decomposition analysis highlighted that F61 (–9.001 kcal/mol),
Q93 (–3.276 kcal/mol), S129 (–1.646 kcal/mol), M130 (–5.252 kcal/mol), W154 (–10.343 kcal/mol), D175 (–4.924
kcal/mol), V177 (–3.188 kcal/mol), H207 (–2.924 kcal/mol), and F208 (–7.033 kcal/mol) of the PET hydrolase
displayed strong binding with BHET (Fig. 5), which confirmed that the PET hydrolase residues play a major role
in the binding of BHET with the enzyme.
Protein Expression and Characterization of the Recombinant PET Hydrolase
The gene encoding the PET hydrolase was cloned into the pET-32a (+) expression vector and expressed in E. coli
BL21(DE). His-tag was added to the N-terminus of the recombinant enzyme to facilitate purification. The soluble
protein was purified by affinity chromatography. Three different concentrations of imidazole (10, 100, and
200 mM) were used to elute the protein. The soluble fr actions are shown in (Fig. S3). The recombinant PET
hydrolase had an estimated molecular mass of approximately 51.31 kDa by SDS-PAGE, which corresponds to the
value obtained by calculating the amino acid sequence of the enzyme.
Enzymatic properties can be influenced by temperature and pH values. The effect of temperature on the PET
hydrolase activity was investigated from 20°C to 70°C at a pH of 7.0 (Fig. 6A). The maximum activity was observed
at 40°C. The relative enzyme activity after 120 min of incubation at 30°C, 50°C, and 60°C was approximately 82, 56
and 60%, respectively, indicating that the PET hydrolase was stable between 30oC and 60oC. However, the enzyme
was unstable above 60°C and retained only about 18% of its activity, probably due to thermal denaturation.
In addition, the effect of pH on the PET hydrolase was tested in a pH range of (4.0 to 10.0) at 40°C (Fig. 6B). The
maximum activity was observed at a pH of 7.0. The enzyme’s activity was highly sensitive to pH changes around
the optimal value (pH 7.0). At pH be low 5.0 and above 9.0, its activity  did not exceed 40%. Optimal enzyme
activity was achieved at a pH of 7.0, while it was almost inactivated at a pH of 4.0. After a 120 min incubation at a
pH of 7.0–8.0, the relative activity of the enzyme remained at about 70% compared to the initial activity. At pH 4.0

(Table 2), positive monovalent alkali metals and divalent alkaline earth metals had a lower inhibitory effect on the
PET hydrolase than transition metals. Zn2+ and Cu2+ showed a significant inhibitory effect on the enzyme, with 25
± 0.43% and 18.51 ± 1.76% relati ve activity, respectively. Fe3+, K+, and Ba 2+ had no obvious effect on enzyme
activity, while the positive bivalent alkaline earth metal Mg2+ activated the PET hydrolase with a relative activity of
110.7 ± 0.06%. In addition, organic compounds such as Tween 20 (1%) strongly inhibited the PET hydrolase with
a relative activity of 71.2 ± 0.15%. Acetonitrile (1%), EDTA (1%) and dimethyl sulfoxide (1%) showed moderate
activation of enzyme activity, while methanol (1%) and ethyl acetate (1%) had little effect on the PET hydrolase
with a relative activity of 125.9 ± 0.23% and 114.8 ± 0.82%, respectively.
Identification of Product from BHET Degradation
PET hydrolases, constituting carboxylic ester hydrolases, demonstrate the ability to hydrolyze BHET due to
their water solubility. Despite a low sequence identity, these enzymes have a remarkably similar function [60]. The
mechanism of BHET hydrolysis begins when PET hydrolases consume the plastic polymer and degrade it into
more readily adaptable monomers. Under these conditions, the microorganisms can take up the plastic

PET hydrolase was determined at different pH values and temperature by using p-NP butyrate (p-NPC 4) as the substrate at

monomers as their main carbon sources, which are then converted into CO2, H2O, CH4, and N2 [61]. To identify
the degradation product of BHET degradation by the PET hydrolase, the degraded product was detected by high-
performance liquid chromatography and the product was confirmed by mass detection. In HPLC chromatograms,
the standard, BHET, and the product MHET were detected at retention times of 11 min and 10.5 min, respectively
(Fig. 7B). Meanwhile, HR-QTOF ESI/MS analysis showed the degradation product MHET from BHET (Fig. 7C).
The profile of the depolymerization products of the PE T hydrolase was similar to that of other bacterial PET
hydrolases and cutinases. The main product is MHET, and while IsPETase in I. skaieneis produces mainly MHET,
a second extracellular enzyme, MHETase, is required for the conversion of MEHT to TPA. Subsequently, a
specialized transporter in the periplasm imports the TPA into the cytoplasm [14]. The degree of depolymerization
by the PET hydrolase was 38% after 30 min. The conversion rate of BHET by Trx-IsPET ase was reported to be
39.34% [62]. Although the difference in conversion rate was not remarkable, the percentage of product formation
by PET hydrolase was almost similar to that of Trx-IsPETase. The limited accessibility and hydrophobic nature of
crystalline PET, as well as the sensitivity of the enzyme to temperature, pH, and specificity, create challenges for
existing PET hydrolases. These variables prevent PET from  being effectively degraded, even when it is widely
distributed in the environment.
Conclusion
In this work, we report for the first time the bioche mical characterization and heterologous expression of
Streptomyces sp. W2061 PET hydrolase in E. coli. The PET hydrolase successfully degraded a single ester bond of
BHET, resulting in the formation of MHET, which wa s analyzed by LC-MS. Additionally, docking and MD
simulations were performed, enabling us to obtain a molecular-level interpretation of the substrate in the active
site. These simulations explored conformational changes and interaction dynamics over time, emphasizing the
potential of our PET hydrolase to degrade plastics and hi ghlighting the structural features that may facilitate
enzymatic activity. Several PET hydrolases have already been discovered, and there is a current need to modify
them to enhance their ability to break down BHET’s ester linkage. Therefore, this research focused on a detailed
study of PET hydrolase with BHET, both in vitro and in silico, thus emphasizing BHET-degrading microbial
hydrolases and their role in reducing microplastic pollution in the environment.
