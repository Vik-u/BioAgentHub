Poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) plastic is chemically inert and persistent. Massive
quantities of PET waste end up in landﬁll sites and oceans, posing major global pollution
concerns. PET degrading enzymes with high efﬁciency provide plastic recycling and
bioremediation possibilities. Here, we report a novel cutinase,MtCut with distinct catalytic
behaviors, derived from the deep sea Nocardiopsaceae family strain. Biochemical
analyses showed MtCut efﬁciently hydrolyzed PET at ambient temperatures and in an
exo-type manner. The activity and stability ofMtCut were enhanced by the addition of
calcium ions. Notably, no hydrolysis products inhibition was observed during PET
depolymerization, suggesting MtCut is a better biocatalyst when compared to other
PET hydrolases. In addition, structural components associated with thermal adaptation
were investigated using molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, and key regions regulating
MtCut thermostability were identiﬁed. Our biochemical and structural analyses ofMtCut
deepen the understanding of PET hydrolysis by cutinases, and provide invaluable insights
on improvement and performance engineering strategies for PET-degrading biocatalysts.

INTRODUCTION
Since the 1950s, plastic materials have become essential in modern society and have greatly changed
human life-styles (Andrady and Neal, 2009). Huge market demands and wide-spread plastics use
have meant that the cumulative plastics output would reach 12,000 million metric tons by 2050
(Geyer et al., 2017). Inappropriate disposal and chemically recalcitrant properties render these
plastics as bulk environmental contaminants, accounting for more than 10% of municipal solid waste
(Jambeck et al., 2015). Thus, plastic contamination of the natural environment is a grave concern.
Critical issues generated by plastic pollution are the formation micro/nanoplastics which circulate
via food chains and absorb toxic compounds threatening human and animal health (Amaral-Zettler
et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020). The only way to permanently eliminate plastic waste before it enters
ecosystems is via destructive thermal treatment, such as combustion or pyrolysis; however, these
processes induce other environmental problems (Simoneit et al., 2005; Al-Salem et al., 2017).

Therefore, plastic biorecycling, aimed at material recovery, is
highly important for resource saving and improving eco-friendly
processes (Wei et al., 2020).
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a low weight, versatile,
and durable synthetic aromatic polyester used to produce textile
ﬁbers and resins for single-use packaging and beverage bottles
(Awaja and Pavel, 2005 ; Welle, 2011 ). PET has a readily
biodegradable structure comprising repeated ester bonds of
terephthalate and ethylene glycol ( Kawai, 2021 ). However,
crystallinity, high molecular weight, and extremely
hydrophobic surface of PET are barriers to effective
biorecycling (Samak et al., 2020). In 2016, a newly discovered
bacterium, Ideonella sakaienesis 201-F6, reportly used PET as a
major carbon and energy source for growth (Yoshida et al., 2016).
The PET depolymerase isolated from I. sakaienesis 201-F6
(IsPETase, EC 3.1.1.101) hydrolyzed PET to momo (2-
hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET), with trace quantities
of bis (2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (BHET), and
terephthalic acid (TPA). However, several cutinases (EC
3.1.1.74) were previously reported to depolymerize PET before
IsPETase ( Chen et al., 2020 ; Arnling Baath et al., 2022 ).
Importantly, IsPETase is highly homologous to bacterial
cutinases.
Cutinases are a group of small serine esterases of theα/β
hydrolase-fold family and are secreted by plant pathogens to
attack and degrade hydrophobic apoplastic barriers comprising
the polyesters, cutin and suberin (Nawrath, 2002; Chen et al.,
2013; Chen et al., 2020). The enzymes possess a Ser-His-Asp
catalytic triad and an oxyanion hole for catalyzing the hydrolysis
of hydrophobic compounds (Bauer et al., 2020). Unlike lipases,
cutinases active sites are located in a shallow binding cleft,
without an amphipathic loop (Longhi and Cambillau, 1999).
Due to this architecture, cutinases hydrolyze high molecular
weight polymer chemicals such as PET (Arnling Baath et al.,
2022). The ﬁrst report on PET enzymatic hydrolysis involved a
cutinase derived fromThermobiﬁda fusca (Müller et al., 2005).
Since then, various cutinase homologs from actinomycetes,
especially the family Nocardiopsaceae, have been discovered as
promising PET hydrolysis candidates (Thumarat et al., 2012;
Kawai et al., 2014). PET hydrolysis appears to be a promiscuous
function of cutinases, since a commercialized fungal cutinase
(HiC) from Humicola insolens, with no homology to bacterial
cutinases, also exhibited high activity against PET (Ronkvist et al.,
2009).
Protein engineering can improve and tailor cutinase properties.
An engineered PET hydrolase, ICCG with four mutations on the
leaf-branch compost cutinase (LCC), displayed simultaneous
improvements in activity and stability toward ef ﬁcient
depolymerization, outperforming all PET hydrolases so far
(Tournier et al., 2020 ). Despite these breakthroughs, it is
noteworthy that all known PET hydrolases exhibit low turnover
rates, which render efﬁcient PET bioremediation largely impossible.
Based on the huge genetic diversity in nature, it is entirely
conceivable that more PET depolymerases with excellent
performances remain to be discovered.
In this work, we describe the biochemical characteristics of a
novel cutinase (MtCut), with PET hydrolyzing activity, from
Marinactinospora thermotolerans DSM45154, a deep sea
(−3,865 m) strain of the Nocardiopsaceae family (Tian et al.,
2009). The enzyme efﬁciently transforms PET into MHET and
TPA at ambient temperatures, with no signiﬁcant inhibitory
effects from hydrolysis products. We also focused on the
distinct temperature adaptations of MtCut and its
thermophilic counterpart, ICCG using structural comparisons,
and identi ﬁed key regions closely associated with enzyme
thermostability. Based on these analyses, ourﬁndings provide
invaluable insights on the catalysis and thermostability of
cutinase-like PET hydrolases.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Protein Expression and Puriﬁcation
A 786 base pair (bp) gene fragment encodingMtCut (GenBank
accession: SJZ42839) without the N-terminal signal peptide was
ampliﬁed from genomic DNA ofM. thermotoleransDSM45154.
Using seamless cloning (Transgen Biotech, Beijing, China), the
gene fragment was cloned into the pET22b (+) vector (Novagen,
Madison, WI, United States) between the NdeI and XhoI
restriction sites, along with a C-terminal hexahistidine (6 ×
His) tag. The construct was veri ﬁed by DNA sequencing.
Recombinant protein was produced in Escherichia coli BL21
(DE3) (Novagen) grown in Luria Broth media containing
100 μg/ml ampicillin at 37
°C until the optical density reached
0.6– 0.8 at 600 nm. Protein expression was then induced by
adding 0.5 mM isopropylβ-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (Sangon,
Shanghai, China) at 16°C for 16 h. Cells were harvested by
centrifugation at 5,000 × g for 10 min, and then the pellet
resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), 500 mM NaCl, and
5 mM imidazole. Cells were disrupted by sonication on ice, and
cell debris removed by centrifugation at 10,000 ×g for 30 min.
The clariﬁed lysate was loaded onto equilibrated Ni-NTA resin
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). After rinsing in binding buffer
(20 mM Tris-HCl (pH8.0), 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole)
and washing buffer [20 mM Tris-HCl (pH8.0), 500 mM NaCl,
20 mM imidazole], recombinant protein was eluted using 20 mM
Tris-HCl (pH8.0), 200 mM imidazole. The proteins were further
puriﬁed by AKTA primer plus system with a HiPrep DEAE FF
16/10 column (GE Healthcare, Chicago, United States) over a
linear 0 – 1.0 M NaCl gradient. Puri ﬁed proteins were
concentrated using an Amicon-Ultra-15 device (Molecular
Weight Cut-off = 10 kDa, Merck-Millipore Co., United States).
Protein purity was analyzed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and protein concentrations
determined by absorbance at 280 nm using the molar extinction
coefﬁcient calculated from amino acid sequence composition
(https://web.expasy.org/protparam/).
Cutinase Assay
All reactions were performed in 96-well plates in 200μl total
volume. We tested para-nitrophenyl (pNP) esters (Aladdin,
Shanghai, China) with chain lengths of C2,C 4,C 6,C 8,C 10,
C12,C 14,C 16, and C18 as cutinase type substrates. To 190μl
20 mM Tris-HCl (pH8.0) buffer plus dissolvedpNP esters, we

Liu et al. Deep Sea Bacterial PET-Hydrolase
added 10 μl puriﬁed MtCut (5 μg/ml). Reaction times ranged
from 10– 30 min at 30°C, and plates were measured in triplicate.
The p-nitrophenol product was measured at 405 nm using an
EnSight™ Multimode microplate reader (PerkinElmer Inc.,
Spokane, WA, United States). One unit of enzyme activity was
deﬁned as the amount of enzyme required to convert 1.0μmol
p-nitrophenol per min under standard conditions. Data,vo (mM/
min) versus [S]0 (mM) wereﬁtted to a Michaelis-Menten model
to calculate kinetic parameters. To determine the optimal
temperature and pH, reaction samples usingp-NP butyrate as
substrate were incubated in the temperature range 5– 70
°C, and
pH range 7.0– 9.5, respectively. Enzyme thermal and pH stability
parameters were measured after a speciﬁed incubation period at a
constant temperature and pH range. Residual activity was
determined after 10 min incubation at 30
°C. The effects of
calcium ions and EDTA on enzyme properties were
determined by adding calcium ions or EDTA at a ﬁnal
concentration of 1 mM. We measured the effect of ﬁnal
calcium ion concentration ranged from 0 to 500 mM on the
cutinase activity.
PET Crystallinity Analysis
We estimated the thermal characteristics and crystallinity of PET
using differential scanning calorimetry (Netzsch DSC 214,
Bavaria, Germany) with a heating rate of 10
°C/min in a
nitrogen environment. Crystallinity (θ) calculations were based
on the following equation (Tournier et al., 2020):
θ /equals (ΔHf − ΔHcc)
ΔHf100% × 100%
Where ΔHf is the melting enthalpy (J/g),ΔHcc is the enthalpy of
cold crystallization (J/g), ΔHf 100% is the theoretical melting
enthalpy of 100% PET crystallization with a value of 140.1 J/g.
PET microparticle (KAI YUAN Plastication Technology Co.,
Dongguan, China) has a melting temperature (Tm) of 247.2°C,
a crystallization temperature of 173.7 °C, a glass transition
temperature ( Tg) of 79.1 °C, a melting enthalpy ( ΔHf)o f
59.78 J/g, and with no observed enthalpy of cold crystallization
(ΔH
cc), thus the crystallinity percentage is 42.67%. PET low
crystallinity (lc-PET) ﬁlms (Goodfellow Ltd., Bad Nauheim,
Germany) have a Tm of 247.5°C, a crystallization temperature
of 173.8°C, a Tg at of 71.9°C, a ΔHf of 37.86 J/g and aΔHcc of
23.4 J/g, thus the crystallinity percentage is 10.32%.
PETase Assay
PET-hydrolytic activity was measured as previously described
(Espino-Rammer et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2021; Kaabel et al.,
2021). Brieﬂy, 10μg/ml puriﬁed enzyme was incubated with 4 mg
high-crystallinity PET microparticles (42.67% crystallinity) in
20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 500 mM NaCl, 10% (v/v) dimethyl
sulfoxide, and 10 mM CaCl
2. Samples were incubated at 150 rpm,
40°C. The reaction was terminated by adding 10μl 1 M HCl to a
2 ml reaction supernatant, and a 25μl aliquot analyzed by high
performance liquid chromatography (Agilent 1,200, CA,
United States) equipped with an SB C-18 column (5μm, 4.6 ×
150 mm, Agilent). The mobile phase was 20 mM phosphoric acid
containing a 10– 100% methanol linear gradientﬂowing at 1 ml/
min. Eluates were monitored at 240 nm and peak areas for BHET,
MHET, and TPA determined based on known standards.
BHETase and MHETase Assay
BHETase and MHETase assays were performed in a total 1,000μl
volume with BHET or MHET dissolved in 900μl 20 mM Tris-
HCl (pH8.0). The concentration gradient of MHET and BHET
was stetted as a range from 0.05 to 1.0 mM. Enzymatic reaction
was started by adding 100 ul of enzyme solution at 40
°Ci n
triplicate. The reaction time of MtCut (0.02 mg/ml), ICCG
(0.05 mg/ml), and IsPETase (0.05 mg/ml) were 15, 120, and
120 min, respectively. Substrate reduction during the reaction
was detected by high performance liquid chromatography. One
unit of enzyme activity was deﬁned as the amount of enzyme
required to reduce 1.0μmol substrate per min under standard
conditions. Data,v
o (mM/min) versus [S]0 (mM) wereﬁtted to a
Michaelis-Menten model to calculate kinetic parameters.
Site-Directed Mutagenesis
Primers ( Supplementary Table S1 ) were designed with
substituted codons at target sites to generate mutants using
one-step site-directed mutagenesis (Zheng et al., 2004). PCR
was performed using Phanta Master DNA polymerase
(Vazyme, Nanjing, China) with the following parameters: 95
°C
for 10 min, followed by 32 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 50°C for 30 s,
and 72°C for 4 min and then 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were
digested with DpnI (MBI Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania) to
remove the methylated parent plasmid and then puriﬁed using
a PCR puriﬁcation kit (GenStar, Beijing, China). The linearized
plasmid derivatives were transformed into E. coli XL1-Blue
competent cells to derive mutant plasmids. After puriﬁcation
and identiﬁcation, target plasmids were transformed intoE. coli
BL21 (DE3) cells for mutant enzymes production, and protein
was expressed and puriﬁed as described above.
Differential Scanning Fluorimetry
DSF studies were performed to assess the thermal stability of
MtCut and ICCG by determiningTm values. White clear 96-well
PCR plates were used, with wells containing 12.5μl buffer A
(20 mM Tris-HCl, pH8.0, 200 mM NaCl), 10μl 1 mg/ml protein
solution in buffer A, and 2.5μl 50 × SYPRO Orange (Sigma-
Aldrich, St Louis, United States) solution in ddH2O, to a ﬁnal
volume of 25μl. DSF studies were conducted using a Bio-Rad
CFX96 real-time PCR system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,
United States), set on the ﬂuorescence resonance energy
transfer channel using 490 nm excitation and 580 nm emission
ﬁlters. Samples were heated from 10 to 95
°C at 0.05°C/s. Protein
unfolding was monitored by detecting changes in SYPRO Orange
ﬂuorescence. Tm values were determined from the peaks of the
ﬁrst derivatives of the melting curve using CFX Manager software
(Bio-Rad).
Molecular Docking
The MtCut protein structure was predicted using the ColabFold
implementation of AlphaFold2 with default parameters (Jumper
et al., 2021; Mirdita et al., 2021). The builtMtCut structure was

Liu et al. Deep Sea Bacterial PET-Hydrolase
prepared for computational docking using the protein
preparation wizard in MOE software (version 2019.0102,
Chemical Computing Group, Montreal, Canada). Hydrogen
atoms were added to the protein– ligand complex at pH 7. The
hydrogen bond network and protein structure were further
optimized to the overall lowest potential energy conﬁguration
using protonate 3D. The ligands were docked using rigid-ﬁt
method with the carbonyl oxygen of the ester bond
constrained in the oxyanion hole formed by Ser178 and His
256). The top-ranked docking conformations based on the default
scoring function of GOLD were selected for further investigation.
Molecular Dynamics Simulations
All MD simulations were performed using AMBER20 (Case et al.,
2021). The AMBER FF19SB force ﬁeld was applied and the
SHAKE algorithm used to restrict all covalent bonds involving
hydrogen atoms, with a time step of 2fs. The Particle Mesh Ewald
method was used to treat long-range electrostatic interactions.
For the solvated system, two steps minimization were performed
before the heating step. Theﬁrst 4,000 cycles of minimization
were performed with all heavy atoms restrained with 50 kcal/
(mol·Å2), whereas solvent molecules and hydrogen atoms were
free to move. Then, non-restrained minimization was conducted
using 2,000 cycles of steepest descent minimization and 2,000
cycles of conjugated gradient minimization. Afterwards, the
whole system was heated from 0 to 308 K in 50 ps using
Langevin dynamics at a constant volume, and then
equilibrated for 400 ps at a constant pressure of 1 atm. A
weak constraint of 10 kcal/(mol·Å2) was used to restrain all
heavy atoms during heating steps. Periodic boundary dynamic
simulations were conducted for the whole system using a
constant composition, pressure, and temperature ensemble at a
constant pressure of 1 atm and 308 K in the production step. In
the production phase, a 100 ns simulation was conducted, after
which the whole system was heated from 308 to 343 K in 100 ns
using Langevin dynamics at a constant volume. Finally, 100 ns
MD simulations were conducted at a constant pressure of 1 atm
and 343 K. Trajectories were further analyzed using Cpptraj (Roe
and Cheatham, 2013).

2012), and 46% with IsPETase from I. sakaiensis (Han et al.,
2017). These homologous enzymes are cutinase-like, with
reported PET hydrolyzing activity. MtCut contained a
conserved pentapeptide sequence motif (GHSMG), and a
catalytic triad (Ser178-Asp224-His256) ( Supplementary
Figure S1 ). To examine MtCut catalytic function, a
recombinant enzyme produced in E. coli was puri ﬁed to
homogeneity using a combined His-tag af ﬁnity and ion
exchange chromatography approach (Figure 1A). The puriﬁed
MtCut molecular mass agreed with the calculated 34 kDa value.
Using pNP-C
4 as the cutinase model substrate,MtCut exhibited
its highest activity at 35°C and pH8.0 (Figures 1B,C). MtCut also
showed typical cold-adapting properties, with more than 30 and
50% of full activity retained at 5 and 15
°C, respectively. In
Addition, the enzyme was unstable under heating treatment,
with only 20% activity detected at 30
°C for 2 h (Figure 1D).
Enzyme kinetics towardpNP acyl esters of different chain lengths
were determined under standard conditions (Table 1). Puriﬁed
MtCut was active toward all testedpNP esters and generated the
highest kcat value against pNP-C8. Thus, MtCut was a cutinase-
type enzyme rather than an esterase or true lipase. However, the
afﬁnity toward longer acyl chains (C
14-C18) was higher than
shorter chains (C4-C12). Overall, no signiﬁcant difference in
catalytic efﬁciency (kcat/Km) was found among C2-C6,C 14-C18
substrates, respectively. Molecular docking was performed to
analyze the underlying mechanism for different kinetic
parameters. Interestingly, a good correlation between catalytic
efﬁciency and ligand binding energy againstMtCut was found
(Supplementary Figure S2A). Closer examination of the docked
structure does not show signi ﬁcant pose differences
(Supplementary Figure S2B).
Enzyme Stability and Activity Are Enhanced
by Calcium Ions (Ca2+)
Enzyme thermostability and activity were enhanced by Ca2+;b y
adding 1 mM CaCl2, the optimum temperature (for pNP-C4
hydrolysis) of MtCut increased from 35 to 40 °C, and also
thermostability was considerably enhanced ( Figures 1B,D ).
Notably, 60% activity was detected at 55°Cu p o nC a2+ addition,
while only 30% activity was observed in the absence of Ca2+.
Enzyme Ca2+-enhanced thermostability was conﬁrmed by DSF,
with theTm determined as the minimal value of each melting peak
(Figure 2A). TheTm value ofMtCut was 33°C without Ca2+ but
increased to 35, 39.5, and 41.5°Ca tC a2+ concentrations of 10, 100,
and 300 mM, respectively. MtCut activity towards pNP-C4
increased with increasing Ca2+concentration, while thepNP-C4
hydrolase activity was inhibited by 33% in the presence of 1 mM
EDTA (Supplementary Figure S3). MtCut PET hydrolysis was
also enhanced by Ca2+,a so b s e r v e db ypNP-C4 hydrolase activity,
but was maximum at 10– 100 mM CaCl2 and decreased at higher
Ca2+ concentrations (Figure 2B). In addition, the optimum
enzyme temperature for PET was 45°C( Supplementary Figure
S4), which was higher than pNP-C4.S i m i l a rC a2+-activating
behaviors toward pNP-esters and PET hydrolysis were
previously reported for another cutinase, Cut190 fromS. viridis
(Kawai et al., 2014).

Liu et al. Deep Sea Bacterial PET-Hydrolase
crystallinity were selected, and hydrolytic performances were
evaluated using released aromatic monomers (combined
BHET, MHET, and TPA). Although the mp-PET possessed a
higher crystallinity (42.67%) than the lc-PET ﬁlms (10.32%),
MtCut displayed more efﬁcient degradation against mp-PET
(Figure 3A), suggesting the PET hydrolysis was in ﬂuenced
more by surface-enzyme contact than crystallinity. Therefore,
mp-PET was used as a standard substrate for further PET
hydrolysis analyses. On closer inspection of released aromatic
products, MtCut (10μg/ml) hydrolyzed mp-PET to MHET and
TPA, plus trace BHET amounts (Figure 3B). When the enzyme
concentration was increased, the proportion of MHET decreased,
with no MHET detected after a 500μg/ml MtCut reaction over
72 h (Figure 3C). Thus, we speculated that MtCut exhibited
higher hydrolytic activity against BHET than MHET, as
conﬁrmed by kinetic analyses on both compounds (Table 2).
Although MtCut showed a higher afﬁnity towards MHET (K
m =
0.75 mM) than BHET (Km = 3.07 mM), thekcat value for BHET
(4.23 s−1) was much higher than MHET (0.13 s−1), leading to an
overall 7-fold higher catalytic efﬁciency for BHET.
PET hydrolysis by MtC u ta t4 0°C was compared with the
well-characterized IsPETase and ICCG (variant of LCC with
improved activity and thermostability) molecules. IsPETase
and ICCG outperformed MtCut at the early stages in a 60 h-
reaction in terms of total released aromatic compounds,
whereas MtCut was better at later reaction stages

(Figure 3D). Product proﬁles showed that the three enzymes
not only differed in terms of reaction rates, but also in terms of
product diversity. All enzymes generated MHET and TPA as
main products. However,IsPETase and ICCG showed a higher
MHET to TPA ratio, while MtCut released both products in
equal quantities (Figure 4A). In terms of barely altered MHET
levels at later stages and the relative slower rate of TPA
production by IsPETase and ICCG, we speculated that
MHET very likely inhibited the enzyme activity. When mp-
PET hydrolysis reactions were performed in the presence of
MHET, signi ﬁcant inhibitory effects were detected toward
IsPETase and ICCG. In contrast, no MHET inhibition
toward MtCut was observed ( Figure 4B ). In Addition,
IsPETase and ICCG exhibited weak hydrolyzing activity
a g a i n s tM H E Ta t4 0
°C, while the catalytic ef ﬁciency of
MtCut was 10-fold higher ( Table 2 ). The catalytic
efﬁciencies on MHET were found to be in accordance with
b i n d i n ge n e r g yb ym o l e c u l a rd o c k i n ga n a l y s e s
(Supplementary Figure S5 ). Thus, different MHET effects
and activities generated distinct PET hydrolysis product
proﬁles, and suggested MtCut was a novel PET hydrolase,
uninhibited by MHET.
Thermal Adaptation Mechanisms by MD
Simulation
Using DSF, MtCut thermostability was compared with ICCG,
one of the most stable PET hydrolases, using DSF (Figure 5A).
One obvious distinction was observed between MtCut and
ICCG and related to temperature adaptation; Tm values were
33 and 74.5 °C, respectively. To elucidate the temperature
adaptation mechanism of both homologous enzymes and

Liu et al. Deep Sea Bacterial PET-Hydrolase
identify key components to engineer thermostability in
cutinase-like enzymes, MtCut and ICCG (PDB entry:
6THT) structures were analyzed. Since our attempts to
obtain MtCut crystals failed, we built an atomic coordinate
structure using AlphaFold2 ( Figure 5B). MD simulations at
different temperatures were performed on MtCut and ICCG
enzymes to investigate global structure changes and localized
ﬂexibility of individual amino acid residues.
When the system temperature increased from 35 to 70
°C in the
100 ns simulation, the recorded root mean square deviation
(RMSD) of MtCut was divided into two segments and that of
ICCG changed from chaotic zone to stable zone (Supplementary
Figures S6A,B). Our structure cluster analysis showed that
MtCut transformed from a single-group to a multi-group
(Supplementary Figure S6C), indicating the protein structure
had rapidly changed. As expected, ICCG adjusted to a single
group with increasing temperature ( Supplementary Figure
S6D). Both computational and experimental results for ICCG
were in agreement and showed the enzyme was more stable under
higher temperatures. Root mean square ﬂuctuation (RMSF)
analysis of each residue was used to describe structural
ﬂexibility during the heating program. When compared with
ICCG, two loops (residues 94– 99 and 289– 301) on the MtCut
surface exhibited higher RMSF values ( Figures 5C,D ).
Interestingly, the latter loop was reportedly involved in Ca
2+
binding, and the two mutations D238C/S283C (corresponding to
residues Asp252 and Ser301 onMtCut) allowed disulﬁde-bond
formation and thermal stabilization of LCC (Tournier et al.,
2020). Moreover, the RMSF ofMtCut residues 249– 262, which
comprised the catalytic loop with the active site His256, were
remarkably increased when the simulation temperature increased
from 35 to 70
°C. While the paired region of thermophilic ICCG
was resistant to heat denaturation, less RMSF increases were
observed. Thus, we propose the catalytic loop which undergoes
conformational changes in response to environmental
temperature likely controls temperature adaptation in
cutinase-like PET hydrolases.
DISCUSSION
Enzymes active against PET represent valuable scaffolds for
plastic recycling applications and the elucidation of substrate
recognition and catalysis mechanisms. The characterized
enzymes involved in PET depolymerization are primarily
cutinases belonging to the α/β hydrolase superfamily (Chen
et al., 2013). In this study, we examined the cutinase activity
of MtCut toward pNP esters and found the enzyme exhibited
similar substrate selectivity and catalytic efﬁciency to reported
cutinases (Thumarat et al., 2012; Arnling Baath et al., 2022) which

superposed and then used to calculate the RMSF.

are more active onpNP-C6 or C8 than C2 or long-chain fatty acid
esters. MtCut also efﬁciently catalyzed PET depolymerization
with a comparable activity similar to the well-studiedIsPETase
and ICCG enzymes at ambient temperatures (Figure 3D). PET
hydrolysis by these cutinases was very likely due to a surface
exposed active site in a shallow cleft that enabled enzymes to
accommodate and hydrolyze insoluble aromatic polyesters
(Figure 5B). In addition, surface pretreatment to increase the
surface dimensions is essential for a more efﬁcient enzymatic
hydrolysis during PET biorecycling;MtCut displayed a higher
activity on microparticles with higher crystallinity when
compared with ﬂat ﬁlms with lower crystallinity (Figure 3A).
The main PET hydrolysis products fromMtCut enzymatic
reactions were species containing one aromatic ring (MHET and
TPA), possibly indicating an exo-type hydrolyzing manner. The
MtCut product proﬁle agreed with previous PET hydrolysis
catalyzed by other cutinases (Yoshida et al., 2016). In spite of
this, cutinases appear to perform the scissions of PET polymer
chains via diverse modes. For example, Thc_Cut1 and Thc_Cut2
hydrolyzed PET in an endo-type manner to generate PET
oligomers as main products ( Tournier et al., 2020 ; Arnling
Baath et al., 2022), while TfCut2 performed PET degradation
via a combinatorial exo- and endo-type mechanism (Wei et al.,
2019). These observations corroborate the notion that α/β
hydrolase-fold enzymes catalyze promiscuous mechanisms via
the same serine-histidine-aspartate catalytic triad (Rauwerdink
and Kazlauskas, 2015).
The enzymatic degradation of PET was inﬂuenced by product
inhibition. As a major hydrolysis product, MHET strongly binds
to TfCut2 and is slowly hydrolyzed (Barth et al., 2015a). The
inhibition of PET hydrolysis by MHET was therefore identiﬁed as
the main factor limiting the polyester hydrolase. To circumvent
this bottleneck, one particular strategy involves a membraneﬁlter
reactor for the continuous removal of low molecular degradation
products to reduce inhibition (Barth et al., 2015b). We observed
that product inhibition was very likely ubiquitous among
cutinases, as other well-characterized PET hydrolases,
IsPETase and ICCG, are strongly inhibited by MHET
(Figure 4B). Interestingly, PET hydrolysis by MtCut was not
inhibited by MHET, suggesting this enzyme was superior to other
and aforementioned PET hydrolases. Based on our kinetic
analyses, MtCut displayed a 10-fold higher hydrolytic
efﬁciency against MHET than IsPETase and ICCG (Table 2),
suggesting released MHET was rapidly degraded. In considering
the similar substrate afﬁnities (K
m values) of the other PET
hydrolases against MHET, we speculate the higher activity of
MtCut may be due to a more structuralﬂexibility of the active site
(Figures 5C,D).
While thermostable PET hydrolases promote efﬁcient PET
depolymerization, considering the T
g values, some studies
performed PET hydrolysis at ambient temperatures to
conserve energy (Sagong et al., 2021). Therefore, temperature
adaptation mechanisms of PET hydrolases are generating a good
deal of interest with respect to the potential applications in areas
such as biorecycling and waste treatment. Since the effects of Ca
2+
are crucial for the activity and stability ofMtCut, we identiﬁed the
conserved residues, Ser301 and Asp252 ofMtCut, as the putative
calcium binding sites by structural alignment with Est119
(Supplementary Figure S7). Substitution of either site with
alanine decreased the optimum temperature and thermal
stability of MtCut ( Figures 1B,D ). The calcium activating
manners of mutant D252A and S301A also differed from wild
type ( Figure 2B ). Additionally, those two residues were
substituted by cysteine to introduce disul ﬁde bond at the
corresponding sites, and D252CS301C displayed more efﬁcient
hydrolysis on PET than wild typeMtCut at higher temperatures
of 45 and 50
°C( Supplementary Figure S4 ). These results
supported the regulatory function of Ca2+ binding on enzyme
activity and stability. Large conformational changes in several
loop regions upon Ca
2+ binding were observed on cutinase
Cut190 (Kawai et al., 2014), and the structural dynamics were
reported to be essential for the PET hydrolysis at higher
temperatures depending on the presence of Ca 2+ (Numoto
et al., 2018). The proteinMtCut is homologous to Cut190 and
Est119 in terms of both structure and function, we assume that
similar mechanisms of Ca
2+ based activation and stabilization
may occur inMtCut. Due to a remarkableTm difference of 40°C
between MtCut and ICCG, the two homologous enzymes are type
models to investigate the thermal adaptation mechanism of PET
hydrolases. From structural and computational analyse, the cold
adaptation ofMtCut may be attributed toﬂexible features within
the protein structure. Speciﬁcally, three surface-exposed loops on
MtCut exhibited distinct differences with ICCG in terms of
conformational dynamics, which could regulate the catalysis
and temperature adaptation of bacterial cutinases. Further
studies, reengineering these enzyme regions to generate
conformational dynamics for mutants with better
thermostability, are warranted.
CONCLUSION
We characterized a novel cutinase-type PET-degrading
enzyme, MtCut, which exhibited ef ﬁcient PET-hydrolyzing
activity at the ambient temperatures. Biochemical studies
showed MtCut performed PET hydrolysis in an exo-type
manner, with both enzyme activity and thermal stability
improved by calcium ions addition. Importantly, MtCut
was not inhibited by the hydrolysis product, MHET,
suggesting MtCut is a better enzyme than other PET
hydrolases. Moreover, the structural elements responsible
for regulating thermal adaptation were identi ﬁed by
computational analyses. Taken together, this novel enzyme
provides insights on PET degradation and temperature
adaptation mechanisms of cutinase-type enzymes, and
suggests a promising in vitro platform to generate better
performing enzymes for PET biorecycling.
