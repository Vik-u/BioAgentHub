Towards synthetic PETtrophy: Engineering 
Pseudomonas putida for concurrent 
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) monomer 
metabolism and PET hydrolase expression

Abstract 
Background: Biocatalysis offers a promising path for plastic waste management and valorization, especially for 
hydrolysable plastics such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Microbial whole-cell biocatalysts for simultaneous PET 
degradation and growth on PET monomers would offer a one-step solution toward PET recycling or upcycling. We 
set out to engineer the industry-proven bacterium Pseudomonas putida for (i) metabolism of PET monomers as sole 
carbon sources, and (ii) efficient extracellular expression of PET hydrolases. We pursued this approach for both PET 
and the related polyester polybutylene adipate co-terephthalate (PBAT), aiming to learn about the determinants and 
potential applications of bacterial polyester-degrading biocatalysts.
Results: P . putida was engineered to metabolize the PET and PBAT monomer terephthalic acid (TA) through genomic 
integration of four tphII operon genes from Comamonas sp. E6. Efficient cellular TA uptake was enabled by a point 
mutation in the native P . putida membrane transporter MhpT. Metabolism of the PET and PBAT monomers ethylene 
glycol and 1,4-butanediol was achieved through adaptive laboratory evolution. We then used fast design-build-test-
learn cycles to engineer extracellular PET hydrolase expression, including tests of (i) the three PET hydrolases LCC, HiC, 
and IsPETase; (ii) genomic versus plasmid-based expression, using expression plasmids with high, medium, and low 
cellular copy number; (iii) three different promoter systems; (iv) three membrane anchor proteins for PET hydrolase 
cell surface display; and (v) a 30-mer signal peptide library for PET hydrolase secretion. PET hydrolase surface display 
and secretion was successfully engineered but often resulted in host cell fitness costs, which could be mitigated 
by promoter choice and altering construct copy number. Plastic biodegradation assays with the best PET hydrolase 
expression constructs genomically integrated into our monomer-metabolizing P . putida strains resulted in various 
degrees of plastic depolymerization, although self-sustaining bacterial growth remained elusive.
Conclusion: Our results show that balancing extracellular PET hydrolase expression with cellular fitness under 
nutrient-limiting conditions is a challenge. The precise knowledge of such bottlenecks, together with the vast array

Introduction
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a linear aromatic 
polyester composed of repeating units of terephthalic 
acid (TA) and ethylene glycol (EG) and is one of the 
most common plastics in the world. Annual production 
of virgin PET amounts to > 60 million metric tons, with 
roughly equal amounts processed as fiber (‘polyester’) for 
the textile industry and as rigid containers for food and 
beverage packaging [1–3]. Due to the short lifetimes of 
many PET products, accumulation of PET waste in land -
fills or terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems is a major con -
cern [4, 5]. Therefore, better incentives for PET recycling 
or safe options for PET disposal are urgently needed. In 
addition, improved options for PET recycling or upcy -
cling may translate into less use of crude oil and con -
tribute to the establishment of a circular plastic (bio)
economy [6–9].
The small fraction of PET waste collected for recycling 
is mostly processed mechanically; however, PET can be 
recycled mechanically only a few times due to process -
ing-induced chain scission and ensuing degradation of 
mechanical properties [10]. To circumvent this, chemical 
recycling (including glycolysis, hydrolysis, methanoly -
sis, and pyrolysis, among others) can be used to depo -
lymerize PET to its constituents TA and EG, followed 
by synthesis of new virgin PET [11]. While this offers a 
truly circular recycling path, chemical depolymerization 
requires high energy input and harsh reaction condi -
tions. Therefore, the use of enzymes for biocatalytic PET 
depolymerization under mild, aqueous, and environmen -
tally friendly reaction conditions has gained significant 
interest.
In the last two decades, a growing number of enzymes 
from bacterial and fungal sources with PET hydrolase 
activity have been characterized. These enzymes typically 
encompass serine hydrolases which natively function as 
cutinases, lipases, or carboxylesterases, and show pro -
miscuous PET hydrolyzing activity [1, 12–16]. Enzymatic 
PET hydrolysis by native, non-engineered enzymes typi -
cally occurs on the order of days to weeks and is severely 
impaired by the semi-crystalline structure of commercial 
PET, which consists of amorphous regions interspersed 
with crystalline regions that are highly refractory to enzy-
matic attack [1, 17, 18]. PET hydrolases are frequently 
engineered to function near the glass transition temper -
ature  (Tg) of PET at ≥ 70  °C where amorphous regions 
become more accessible, with the latest generation of 
enzymes capable of degrading PET samples at elevated 
temperatures within as little as 10 h [19–21].
In addition to enzymatic PET depolymerization, biol -
ogy can be leveraged for recycling applications down -
stream of polymer hydrolysis. The PET monomers TA 
and EG can be used as metabolic feedstocks for biochem-
ical production pathways in engineered microbes. Recent 
examples include the engineering of bacterial strains 
capable of transforming TA and/or EG into value-added 
products such as β-ketoadipic acid, glycolic acid, and the 
bioplastics polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) and poly(amide 
urethane) [21–25].
Considering these two facets of biology for PET recy -
cling, a clear continuation would be the combination of 
enzymatic PET depolymerization and monomer metab -
olism in the same microbial organism (Fig.  1). Indeed, 
nature itself already delivered this solution: In 2016, 
researchers isolated the bacterium Ideonella sakaien -
sis 201-F6 from a PET recycling site and showed that it 
possesses the enzymatic machinery to both depolymer -
ize PET and utilize the resulting monomers as carbon 
source for growth [26]. Here, we set out to replicate this 
feature by engineering a bacterium with the capacity to 
both degrade PET and metabolize the monomers as car -
bon sources, a capacity we refer to as synthetic PETtro -
phy. In addition to PET, we pursued this approach for 
the more readily biodegradable polyester polybutylene 
adipate co-terephthalate (PBAT). We implemented this 
strategy using the soil bacterium Pseudomonas putida, 
which, in contrast to I. sakaiensis, is already established 
as a promising host for industrial biocatalytic processes 
due to robust growth under harsh conditions and has a 
vast array of tools and knowledge available for genetic 
engineering [27–29]. 
Successful engineering of synthetic PETtrophy would 
be a step towards consolidated bioprocessing of PET 
waste. The concept of consolidated bioprocessing 
originated in the field of lignocellulosic biomass utili -
zation and includes synthesis of hydrolytic enzymes, 
polymer hydrolysis, and downstream routing of mono -
mers into biosynthetic pathways by the same microbial 
organism in a single fermentation setup [6 , 30, 31]. A 
whole-cell biocatalyst for PET continuous bioprocess -
ing would simplify the recycling workflow and may 
be able to deal with contaminated or mixed-plastic 
of PET hydrolase expression tools generated and tested here, may serve as a baseline for future efforts to engineer P.  
putida or other bacterial hosts towards becoming efficient whole-cell polyester-degrading biocatalysts.

Fig. 1 Synthetic PETtrophy in relation to other biocatalytic strategies for PET waste valorization. Top panel: PET waste can be depolymerized to 
TA and EG using chemical means (1), with purified PET hydrolases (2), or using whole-cell biocatalysts displaying or secreting PET hydrolases (3) 
(note: potential PET depolymerization intermediates bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) and mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) are 
omitted for clarity). TA and EG can be extracted and processed into new virgin PET (A); used as feedstocks for engineered microbes and production 
of value-added bioproducts (B); or used as feedstocks for engineered microbes producing PET hydrolases in a continuous bioprocessing-like 
one-pot system (C). Path 2-A was explored by Tournier et al. [19] and Lu et al. [21]; path 1-B was explored by Kenny et al. [22, 94], Werner et al. [24] 
and Kim et al.; [25] path 2-B was described by Tiso et al. [23] and Lu et al. [21]; path 3-C is what I. sakaiensis perfoms natively [26] and was explored 
in this study. Additionally, several recent studies described whole-cell biocatalysts displaying or secreting PET hydrolases (3) without attempting 
downstream extraction or microbial utilization of released monomers. [59, 76–83] Bottom panel: sequence of engineering steps attempted in this 
study. First, we installed TA, EG or BD metabolism in P . putida using genetic engineering and adaptive laboratory evolution (I); secondly, we tested a 
variety of expression systems for PET hydrolases (II); third, we attempted to combine these efforts to obtain a self-sustaining whole-cell PET or PBAT 
depolymerization system (III). Enzyme structure PDB 5xjh. [95]

waste streams. It may also lend itself to decentralized 
in  situ bioremediation of PET waste (e.g., in landfills 
or dedicated composting facilities), thus rendering 
PET a biodegradable waste and ‘ecocyclable’ [3 , 32]. 
Additionally, we were motivated to discover potential 
bottlenecks and dos-and-don’ts encountered in the 
synthetic PETtrophy engineering endeavor in order to 
understand the fundamental determinants of bacterial 
PET utilization as a carbon source.
We first engineered P. putida to accept TA, EG and 
1,4-butanediol (BD, a component of PBAT) as sole car -
bon and energy sources. Next, we used rapid design-
build-test-learn cycles to achieve functional expression 
of diverse PET hydrolases. Lastly, we tested the most 
promising strains in whole-cell PET or PBAT deg -
radation experiments. While we did not obtain fully 
self-sustaining plastic-depolymerizing bacterial sys -
tems, our work provides detailed insights into engi -
neering of PET monomer metabolism, PET hydrolase 
expression construct design, and the challenges of 
balancing enzyme expression and cell viability under 
nutrient-limiting conditions, all of which may prove 
useful for future efforts towards establishing synthetic 
PETtrophy.
Results
Establishing TA catabolism in Pseudomonas putida KT2440
Our first goal was to enable Pseudomonas putida KT2440 
to use TA as sole carbon and energy source. A common 
aromatic acid catabolite in P. putida is protocatechuate 
(PCA), which feeds into central carbon metabolism 
via the β-ketoadipate pathway [33]. However, P. putida 
KT2440 cannot convert TA to PCA; importantly though, 
enzyme cascades catalyzing this transformation have 
been found in various bacteria [30]. We selected four 
genes from the tph II operon of Comamonas sp. E6 [34], 
encoding the multi-subunit TA dioxygenase  TphAII that 
transforms TA to 1,2-dihydroxy-3,5-cyclohexadiene-
1,4-dicarboxylate (DCD), and the DCD dehydrogenase 
 TphBII that transforms DCD to PCA, to endow P. putida 
with the ability to transform TA to PCA (Fig.  2A). We 
designed a synthetic operon consisting of the Coma -
monas sp. E6 genes tphA1 II, tphA2II, tphA3II and tph -
BII under control of the constitutive  PEM7 promoter 
and endowed it with a bicistronic translational coupler 
(BCD2) to ensure efficient transcription and translation 
in P. putida (Additional file  1: Fig. S1) [35, 36]. We did 
not include a selectable antibiotic resistance marker in 
the knock-in cassette, as the capacity to catabolize TA is

itself a selectable trait. The operon was cloned into the 
mini-TN5 transposon vector pBAMD1-2 (yielding vec -
tor pBAMD-tphII), enabling random integration of the 
operon into the P. putida genome [37]. 
pBAMD-tphII was delivered to P. putida KT2440 by 
electroporation, and cells were cultured in M9 minimal 
medium supplemented with 0.4% TA as sole carbon 
source to select for cells with functional integration of the 
synthetic tphII operon. We adjusted the culture medium 
to pH 5.5 to ensure that a certain fraction of TA mole -
cules is fully protonated and thus able to diffuse through 
the cell membrane in the absence of dedicated TA trans -
porters [34, 38]. We observed bacterial growth two 
days post-transformation and passaged the culture over 
10 days, followed by subsequent analysis of single clones. 
The best-performing clone was designated as strain P. 
putida TA; whole-genome sequencing revealed integra -
tion of the tphII cassette into the PP_4627 (cidR) locus 
(Additional file  1: Table  S1). This strain showed robust 
growth in M9 minimal medium supplemented with TA, 
while no growth was observed for P. putida KT2440 
(Fig. 2B).
We next set out to modify P. putida TA to grow at neu-
tral pH. At pH 7, TA is in its partially or fully deproto -
nated form, necessitating TA transporters for cellular 
uptake. Considering that P. putida has a variety of mem -
brane transporters for aromatic compounds [39], we 
reasoned that adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) may 
succeed in repurposing an existing P. putida transporter 
to function as a TA uptake transporter. Thus, we cul -
tured P. putida TA in M9 medium with 0.4% TA adjusted 
to pH 6.5 for six consecutive passages over seven days, 
after which we observed improved bacterial growth 
(Additional file  1: Fig. S2). Isolation and analysis of sin -
gle clones yielded strain P. putida TA7, which showed 
strongly improved growth over parent strain P. putida 
TA at neutral pH (Fig.  2C). Whole-genome sequenc -
ing (Additional file  1: Table  S2) of both strains revealed 
a missense mutation in P. putida TA7 in a MarR-family 
putative transcriptional regulator for hydroxycinnamic 
acid degradation (PP_3359; c.151C > T, R51C) [40] and a 
missense mutation in the putative 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)
proprionate transporter MhpT (PP_3349; c.1120C > G, 
L374V) [41]. This indicated that MhpT has promiscu -
ous TA transport activity, which was likely enhanced by 
the L374V mutation. The mutation in the putative tran -
scription factor PP_3359, located only 12 kbp upstream 
of mhpT, may influence mhpT expression. We confirmed 
the function of  MhpTL374V as a putative TA transporter 
by rescuing growth of P. putida TA in M9-TA medium 
at pH 7.5 by plasmid-based overexpression of mhpT L374V 
(Additional file 1: Fig. S3).
Overall, through genomic knock-in of four genes from 
the TA-to-PCA pathway of Comamonas sp. E6 followed 
by brief ALE, we obtained strain P. putida TA7 capable of 
robust growth on TA as sole carbon and energy source.
Establishing EG and BD metabolism in P . putida TA7
We next aimed to establish EG metabolism in P. putida 
TA7 based on two considerations. First, high EG con -
centrations negatively affected growth of P. putida TA7 
(Additional file  1: Fig. S4A). Second, turning EG from 
a liability to a potential carbon source would support 
robust growth on PET, especially considering that PET 
hydrolysis is the rate-limiting step, and any released 
monomers should be utilized as efficiently as possible.
P. putida possesses the enzymatic machinery required 
to utilize EG as carbon and energy source; however, tran-
scription of the genes encoding the two key enzymes Gcl 
and GlxR is constitutively repressed by the transcrip -
tional repressor GclR (Additional file 1: Fig. S4B) [42–44]. 
Thus, we attempted ALE of P. putida TA7 for growth on 
EG, using cultures in M9 minimal medium supplemented 
with 25 mM EG and 5 mM TA.
We observed improved bacterial growth after approxi -
mately one week and isolated single clones after eleven 
days of passaging (Additional file  1: Fig. S5); the best-
performing strain was designated P. putida TA7-EG. 
This strain showed both a shorter lag phase and higher 
final OD600 compared to P. putida TA7 when grown in 
M9 supplemented with equimolar amounts of TA and 
EG (Fig.  2D). Cell dry weight measurements of P. putida 
TA7-EG cultures confirmed an improved capacity of 
P. putida TA7-EG to accumulate biomass (Additional 
file  1: Fig. S6). Both strains showed comparable growth 
in LB medium, while P. putida TA7-EG showed a slight 
growth advantage with TA as only carbon source (Addi -
tional file  1: Fig. S7A, B). Whole-genome sequencing of 
P. putida TA7-EG revealed a nonsense mutation in gclR 
(PP_4283; c.388G > T, E130*; Additional file  1: Table S2), 
likely resulting in GclR loss of function, which is con -
sistent with previous studies on the molecular basis of 
improved EG catabolism [42–44].
For the PBAT monomer BD, we set up two ALE cul -
tures with P. putida TA7 in M9 minimal medium supple-
mented with either 25 mM BD and 5 mM TA, or 25 mM 
BD, 5 mM TA, and 25 mM adipic acid (AA), the second 
aliphatic linker in PBAT. Both ALE cultures showed 
similar growth profiles, and we observed improved 
growth after ten days, when we isolated and tested sin -
gle clones (Additional file  1: Fig. S8). The strain show -
ing best growth characteristics was designated P. putida 
TA7-BD (Fig. 2E). Both P. putida TA7 and P. putida TA7-
BD showed comparable growth in LB medium, while 
Page 6 of 31Brandenberg et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2022) 21:119 
we observed a minor detrimental effect when AA was 
added to the medium (Additional file  1: Fig. S7C, D). P. 
putida TA7-BD carried a missense mutation in PP_2046 
(c.407  T > C, V136A), a gene previously implicated as 
a transcriptional regulator of an operon involved in BD 
metabolism, with gain of function mutations resulting in 
improved growth on BD [45].
Interestingly, across all ALE experiments and engi -
neered strains, we did not detect any mutations in the 
tphII cassette (Additional file  1: Table S2). This indicates 
that the chosen operon design, including the transcrip -
tional output from the  PEM7 promoter, is likely close to 
optimal; at least, no mutations appeared to have a posi -
tive effect on bacterial growth strong enough to fix in the 
population during our ALE experiments.
In summary, ALE rapidly succeeded in endowing P. 
putida TA7 with the ability to use either EG or BD as 
additional carbon and energy sources, and the resulting P. 
putida TA7-EG and P. putida TA7-BD represent robust 
strains for engineering PET hydrolase expression.
Engineering PET hydrolase surface display
We next aimed to endow P. putida with the enzymatic 
machinery required to depolymerize PET or PBAT. We 
first attempted display of PET hydrolases on the bacterial 
outer membrane, speculating that such surface display 
may provide higher local enzyme concentrations and bet-
ter adsorption of the PET hydrolase to the plastic surface, 
thereby promoting more efficient hydrolysis.
To obtain a stable and functional PET hydrolase dis -
play system for P. putida, we cloned and tested three dif -
ferent membrane display anchors, all previously shown 
to function in P. putida (Additional file  1: Fig. S9). First, 
we used a construct based on the E. coli autotransporter 
EhaA [46]. This construct consists of the P. putida OprF 
signal peptide (37 residues), the cargo domain (i.e., the 
PET hydrolase to be displayed), a  G4SGGS(G4S)3 linker 
[47], and the C-terminal EhaA autotransporter domain 
(488 residues). Second, we employed a construct based 
on the commonly used ice nucleation protein display 
anchors, comprising the N-terminal 203 residues fused 
to the C-terminal 97 residues of the ice nucleation pro -
tein inaV from Pseudomonas syringae [48]. This anchor 
domain is followed by the  G4SGGS(G4S)3 linker and the 
PET hydrolase cargo domain. Last, we employed the P. 
putida OprF outer membrane protein as anchor domain, 
as previously demonstrated using OprF from Pseu -
domonas aeruginosa [49]. This construct comprised the 
N-terminal 206 residues of P. putida OprF, followed by 
the  G4SGGS(G4S)3 linker and the PET hydrolase cargo 
domain. Of note, full-length OprF has been shown to 
adopt two different conformations, with the cargo fusion 
site V206 predicted to be either periplasmic or extracel -
lular [50]. Based on reports of extracellular exposure of 
V206 in OprF homologs [51, 52], we decided to try this 
construct for PET hydrolase display.
All display constructs were put under control of the 
rhamnose-inducible  PrhaB promoter, shown to provide 
low levels of leaky transcription and high induction lev -
els in P. putida. [53, 54] All constructs also featured the 
BCD2 translational coupler used for our tph II operon 
described above [36], a hexa-His tag attached to the cargo 
domain opposite from the anchor domain, unique PstI 
and NcoI restriction sites for facile cloning of different 
cargo domains into the display systems, and unique AvrII 
and HindIII sites to transfer the entire display cassettes 
between vectors (Additional file  1: Fig. S9). Furthermore, 
as expression of heterologous membrane proteins often 
leads to bacterial growth defects, we implemented an 
extra layer of control over display construct expression 
levels by modulating gene dosage using plasmid vectors 
with low (RK2), medium (pBBR1), and high (pRO1600/
ColE1) cellular copy number [55]. All plasmids carried a 
 KmR selectable marker and were constructed from plas -
mids obtained through the Standard European Vector 
Architecture (SEVA) repository [56]. In total, this yielded 
nine display construct-vector combinations (Fig. 3A).
We chose three well-known PET hydrolases for test -
ing: the Humicola insolens cutinase (HiC), leaf compost 
cutinase (LCC), and Ideonella sakaiensis PETase (IsP). 
HiC is a thermostable fungal cutinase of 194 residues 
capable of almost completely degrading low-crystallinity 
PET film within 96 h at 70 °C, with TA as predominant 
hydrolysis product [57]. LCC is a 293 residue protein 
and was isolated through functional screening of a com -
post metagenomic library [58]. LCC and variants thereof 
have long been recognized as some of the most promis -
ing PET hydrolases, achieving hydrolysis of amorphous

PET to TA and EG on the gram to kg scale [19, 23]. IsP 
is a 290 residue protein that is regarded as the first iden -
tified enzyme with the native function to enable bacte -
rial growth on PET as sole carbon and energy source. 
IsP stands out for its high PET hydrolysis activity at 
mesophilic temperatures (30–40  °C), where it surpasses 
thermostable PET hydrolases; however, LCC and HiC 
are more active when used at their optimum tempera -
tures [26, 57, 58]. In contrast to HiC and LCC, IsP yields 
MHET as main hydrolysis product, which is further 
hydrolyzed to TA in I. sakaiensis by MHETase [26]. How-
ever, we omitted MHETase from our approach, as recent 
studies indicated TA accumulation in long-term PET 
hydrolysis setups with IsP alone [59], and we wanted to 
obtain a clean comparison of PET hydrolase expression 
levels without expression of auxiliary enzymes.
We first cloned ORFs of both HiC and LCC (omitting 
their signal peptides) into the set of nine display vec -
tors (IsP was included only later). Upon transformation 
of P. putida TA7-EG with these plasmids, we observed 
only sporadic colony formation for all pRO1600/ColE1 
plasmids; presumably, leaky expression from these high 
copy number plasmids was sufficient to induce bacterial 
growth defects, and these plasmids were excluded from 
further analyses. Additionally, initial analyses showed no 
PET hydrolase expression for any of the InaV display con-
structs, and they were also excluded from further analy -
ses. For the remaining plasmids, we tested cell viability 
and PET hydrolase expression over time in shaking cul -
tures (Fig.  3B). As a proxy for cell viability we measured 
OD600, while we used the commonly employed ester -
ase model substrate para -nitrophenylbutyrate (pNPB) 
and a spectrophotometric read-out of para -nitrophenol 
formation to assess enzymatic activity of expressed PET 
hydrolases (Additional file 1: Fig. S10). We performed the 
pNPB esterase assay for both cleared culture supernatant 
and the cell fraction.
For P. putida TA7-EG transformed with empty vec -
tors (lacking PET hydrolases), we observed stable growth 
and very low esterase activity both in the cell fraction 
and the culture supernatant following induction (Fig.  3B, 
C). In contrast, for all strains expressing PET hydrolase 
display constructs, we observed strong increases in cell-
associated esterase activity, indicating functional PET 
hydrolase surface display. The highest cell-associated 
esterase activity was measured for OprF-HiC at 2.68 U/
mL 3 h post-induction, 330-fold above the empty-vector 
control. SDS-PAGE analysis of the membrane fraction 
of PET hydrolase-expressing cells followed by LC–MS 
analysis confirmed correct expression and localiza -
tion of the EhaA membrane display constructs, while 
the observed bands for OprF constructs were less clear 
(Additional file  1: Fig. S11). Approximately 1–2  h after 
the cell-associated esterase signal we also observed spikes 
in esterase activity in the culture supernatant, likely origi-
nating from cell lysis. Indeed, for all bacteria expressing 
PET hydrolase display constructs, we observed growth 
defects following induction, with most cultures collaps -
ing (decrease in OD600 with visible cell lysis, clumping, 
and increase in medium viscosity) starting 3–4  h post-
induction (Fig.  3B, C). Plate reader analysis of OD600 
for 24  h post-induction confirmed the collapse of PET 
hydrolase-expressing cultures (Additional file 1: Fig. S12). 
Growth defects appeared to be slightly more pronounced 
for the medium copy number pBBR1 plasmids compared 
to the low copy number RK2 plasmids.
To investigate the observed cell death upon PET hydro-
lase display construct expression, we first tested whether 
cytosolic expression of the PET hydrolase ORFs (with -
out the membrane display anchors) would cause similar 
growth defects. Surprisingly, we observed that cytosolic 
expression of LCC indeed resulted in a similar collapse 
of the bacterial culture. In contrast, cytosolic expression 
of HiC or IsP resulted in normal bacterial growth rates 
(Additional file  1: Fig. S13). The reason for the observed 
LCC toxicity in P. putida remains to be determined, while 
surface display construct expression appears to be the 
major culprit for all three enzymes.
Next, we tested whether titration of the inducer, rham -
nose, could mitigate the problem of expression construct 
toxicity. We used one of the constructs showing the high-
est PET hydrolase membrane expression and the lowest 
apparent toxicity, EhaA-LCC in the RK2 plasmid back -
ground, and varied rhamnose inducer concentration 
from 0.5 to 8 mM. This revealed a very limited dynamic 
range for expression from the  PrhaB promoter, with 
0.5 mM rhamnose already providing high levels of induc-
tion and leading to culture collapse, as seen for all other 
inducer concentrations (Additional file 1: Fig. S14).
Thus, the EhaA and OprF display anchors resulted in 
successful cell surface display of PET hydrolases. How -
ever, membrane display construct expression also caused 
cellular instability, which could not be mitigated by lower 
inducer concentrations.
Engineering PET hydrolase secretion
Parallel to engineering PET hydrolase cell surface display 
we explored options for PET hydrolase secretion, which 
we speculated may result in lower cellular toxicity com -
pared to membrane display.
Protein secretion is highly dependent on the N-ter -
minal signal peptide (SP). Secretion levels can differ by 
orders of magnitude depending on the SP , and a highly 
efficient SP for one protein may not work well for another 
[60]. In addition, extracellular protein secretion in 
Gram-negative bacteria such as P. putida is incompletely

Brandenberg et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2022) 21:119 
 
understood [61, 62]. Therefore, we used a SP library 
screening approach to achieve efficient PET hydrolase 
secretion. We tested a set of 30 SPs, 28 originating from 
Pseudomonas proteins annotated as secreted or peri -
plasmic, and the remaining two being the SPs from the 
I. sakaiensis PETase and MHETase (Additional file  1: 
Table S3). Of these 30 SPs, 19 were predicted to be Sec-
dependent, while 11 were predicted to be Tat-dependent. 
Instead of cloning each SP individually, we cloned the 
library in bulk using a specifically designed plasmid such 
that the LCC, HiC and IsP ORFs were provided with the 
SP library in-frame at the 5’ end (Fig. 4A, B). We retained 
the  PrhaB promoter, BCD2 bicistronic translational cou -
pler, and RK2 low copy number oriV already used for the 
membrane display constructs.
Using a library-based approach necessitated a screen -
ing procedure to identify the most effective SPs for each 
PET hydrolase. Thus, P. putida TA7-EG was transformed 
with each of the three SP-PET hydrolase libraries, and 
for each library 90 single clones (threefold oversam -
pling) were analyzed in 96-well liquid shaking cultures. 
To assess PET hydrolase secretion, we measured both 
esterase activity in the supernatant (3  h post-induction) 
and OD600 as proxy for cell viability (3 h and 20 h post-
induction) (Fig. 4C); cells transformed with empty vector 
served as controls. For both LCC and HiC, we observed 
that almost all SP library clones showed strongly reduced 
OD600 at 20  h post-induction; the few clones showing 
higher, control-like OD600 showed no PET hydrolase 
expression (i.e., no esterase activity in the culture super -
natant). Furthermore, for both the LCC and HiC librar -
ies, we observed a wide range of esterase activities in the 
culture supernatants 3 h post-induction, indicative of dif-
ferent PET hydrolase secretion efficiencies of the differ -
ent SPs. For IsP , the low intrinsic activity of this enzyme 
in the pNPB assay resulted in a lower resolution between 
the library clones and controls, although it remained pos-
sible to identify clones showing higher supernatant ester-
ase activity. At the same time, more clones retained high 
OD600 levels compared to LCC and HiC (Fig. 4C).
For all three libraries, we extracted and sequenced plas-
mids from the 10 to 14 clones showing the best combina-
tion of supernatant esterase activity and OD600. For all 
three enzymes, we observed recurring hits (i.e., SPs iden -
tified more than once across the sequenced set), and the 
SP hits across the three libraries differed from each other, 
indicating that the assay was specific for each PET hydro-
lase and that the libraries did not suffer from substan -
tial cloning bias towards certain SPs. For LCC, out of 12 
sequenced clones one SP was identified in 3 clones (ispe, 
the SP from IsP) and three SPs were identified twice (flid, 
efeb, and uxpb). For HiC, the dominant SP with 5 hits 
out of 10 sequenced clones was bglx. For IsP , out of 14 
sequenced clones one SP was identified three times (lasb) 
and two SPs were identified twice (copb and agde) (Addi-
tional file 1: Table S4).
We next tested the most promising SP-PET hydrolase 
constructs (featuring all SPs identified multiple times per 
library) in shake flask cultures by monitoring PET hydro -
lase activity and OD600 over time. For all LCC and HiC 
constructs, we observed strong increases in supernatant 
and cell-associated esterase activity over the first 4 h fol -
lowing rhamnose induction. One of the best variants, 
bglx-HiC, showed an esterase signal in the supernatant of 
1.71  U/mL 4  h post-induction, a 114-fold increase over 
the control. However, for both LCC and HiC, this was 
again accompanied by a subsequent collapse of the bacte-
rial cultures, similar to the growth defects observed for 
the membrane-displayed constructs (Fig.  4D and Addi -
tional file  1: Fig. S15). For both LCC and HiC, we also 
observed a strong cell-associated esterase signal; by com -
paring the esterase activity of secreted and cytosolic PET 
hydrolase expression in culture supernatant, cell fraction, 
and cell lysate, we concluded that this is likely an artefact 
of PET hydrolase expression in the secretory pathway 
(Additional file  1: Fig. S16). For IsP , we observed com -
parably small increases in supernatant esterase activity 
(either due to low IsP secretory expression or low activity 
of the enzyme in the pNPB assay) with the best variant, 
lasb-IsP , reaching 0.1  U/mL 4  h post-induction, 6.5-fold 
above the control. Importantly, the OD600 of all IsP 
expression cultures remained relatively stable (Fig.  4D 
and Additional file 1: Fig. S15).
In summary, our strategy of screening a 30-mer SP 
library resulted in the identification of SPs successfully 
directing the secretion of each of the three PET hydro -
lases. However, for LCC and HiC, secretory construct 
expression again resulted in cellular growth defects. For 
IsP , we observed only low esterase activity in the super -
natant, but cell fitness remained high.
Fine‑tuning PET hydrolase expression with heat‑inducible 
promoters
Since both surface display and secretion of LCC, HiC 
and IsP by our P. putida chassis was achievable but often 
incurred fitness costs, we turned our attention towards 
mitigating this problem. We reasoned that in both cases 
a likely culprit is an overload of the cellular machinery 
for protein folding, protein membrane insertion or pro -
tein translocation across inner and outer membranes [63, 
64]. Thus, reducing PET hydrolase expression levels may 
result in improved cellular fitness.
As we observed for  PrhaB, promoter systems rely -
ing on chemical inducers often show close to an all-or-
none response, cannot be easily switched off again, or 
require genetic modifications to achieve a finely tunable 
Page 10 of 31Brandenberg et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2022) 21:119 
expression response [65, 66]. Thus, we turned our atten -
tion to temperature-inducible promoters, where expres -
sion can be precisely steered by the intensity and 
duration of a heat shock. Using such a tightly controllable 
physical stimulus has the additional advantage of not 
requiring any chemical inducers, which could potentially 
be metabolized by the cells and thereby confound plastic 
growth assays.

We tested two heat-inducible promoter systems, 
both cloned into the RK2 low copy number plasmid. 
First, we used the cI857/P L system, which is frequently 
used in E. coli and was recently shown to function effi -
ciently in P. putida [67]. The system consists of the  PL 
promoter blocked by the constitutively expressed heat-
labile cI857 repressor, which is inactivated at elevated 
temperatures (ideally, above 40  °C), thereby allowing 
transcription from  PL. We designed this system as pre -
viously described [67], adding the BCD2 linker at the 
5’ end preceding the PET hydrolase surface display or 
secretion cassettes (Fig. 5 A).
Second, we used a short transcriptional-translational 
control unit natively regulating expression of the heat 
shock protein IbpA in P. putida and P. aeruginosa [68]. 
This system consists of a promoter under control of the 
Fig. 5 Testing  PL and  PIbpA heat shock inducible promoters. A Overview of the cI857/PL system; this transcriptional regulatory unit spans 1410 bp

alternative heat shock sigma factor σ32. Furthermore, 
the IbpA mRNA 5’ UTR forms an RNA thermometer 
(RNAT) consisting of two hairpins that sequester the 
ribosome binding site. Upon heat shock (ideally, above 
37 °C), the hairpins melt, releasing the RBS and enabling 
initiation of translation. We utilized the IbpA unit of P. 
aeruginosa, providing threefold lower expression upon 
induction compared to IbpA from P. putida. We further 
introduced a 5’ UTR mutation (C40A) shown to further 
lower basal expression and provide a tenfold induction 
upon heat shock [68], and mutated the last three nucle -
otides preceding the start codon to introduce a unique 
NdeI restriction site (Fig.  5B). The BCD2 coupler was 
omitted, as its two strong RBSs would interfere with this 
system. The entire resulting transcriptional-translational 
regulator has a length of only 115  bp. In the following, 
we refer to this modified P. aeruginosa  PIbpa-5’ UTR con-
struct as  PIbpA. Notably, the mere presence of the three 
promoter systems  (PrhaB, cI857/P L, or  PIbpA) on empty 
vector control plasmids did not influence P. putida fitness 
(Additional file 1: Fig. S17).
We initially tested  PL and  PIbpA with the two most 
promising PET hydrolase expression constructs: the sur -
face display construct EhaA-LCC and the secreted bglx-
HiC construct. For  PIbpA only, we also tested the secreted 
lasb-IsP , but substituted for IsP the recently described, 
more thermostable DuraPETase (in the following 
referred to as  IsPDura) [20]. We reasoned that this variant 
may tolerate the necessary heat shocks better while also 
showing enhanced catalytic activity on PET. To first test 
the expression behavior of the constructs, we subjected 
P. putida TA7-EG transformed with the plasmids to 1 h 
heat shocks at 30°, 37° or 40 °C, followed by a 20 h out -
growth phase at 30 °C during which we measured culture 
OD600 and esterase activity in the supernatant and the 
cell fraction (Fig. 5C).
For  PL, all cultures regardless of the heat shock regime 
showed good cell growth (Fig.  5D). However, we also 
observed relatively low PET hydrolase expression lev -
els, in agreement with previous work reporting longer 
and higher heat shocks required for optimal expression 
from  PL [67]. For pLo-P L-EhaA-LCC, we recorded a 2.5-
fold induction of cell-associated esterase activity 20  h 
after the 40 °C heat-shock, while we observed a ninefold 
induction of supernatant esterase activity for pLo-P L-
bglx-HiC under the same conditions (Fig. 5E, F).
For  PIbpA, we observed mild growth defects for EhaA-
LCC and lasb-Isp Dura, regardless of heat shock regime, 
while bglx-HiC showed unimpaired cell growth. At the 
same time, we observed good PET hydrolase expres -
sion (Fig.  5E, F). For pLo-P IbpA-EhaA-LCC, we observed 
a 104-fold induction of cell-associated esterase activity 
20  h after the 30  °C heat shock; interestingly, this was 
threefold higher than the esterase activity following the 
40  °C heat shock. For pLo-P IbpA-bglx-HiC, we recorded 
an 80-fold increase in supernatant esterase activity 20 h 
after the 40 °C heat shock, with induction levels for the 
30 °C and 37 °C heat shocks just slightly lower. For pLo-
PIbpA-lasb-IsPDura, we observed a fivefold induction of 
supernatant esterase activity. Of note, across all three 
 PIbpA constructs, it appeared that maintaining the culture 
at 30 °C (without a dedicated heat shock at 37 °C or 40 °C) 
already resulted in relatively high expression levels. Over-
all, these data pointed towards a promising function of 
 PIbpa for achieving good PET hydrolase expression while 
maintaining cell fitness, especially for the secreted bglx-
HiC construct.
Next, we further defined the temperature-depend -
ent expression behavior of  PIbpA. Cultures of P. putida 
TA7-EG transformed with empty vector or pLo-P IbpA-
bglx-HiC were shifted from 25  °C to either a constant 
expression temperature of 30 °C or a heat shock at 37 °C 
for 2, 4, 6, or 20  h, followed by an outgrowth phase at 
30  °C; all cultures were analyzed 20  h after the start of 
the heat shock (Fig. 6A). We observed a constant increase 
in supernatant esterase activity from 0.85 U/mL to 1.6 U/
mL (empty vector: 0.025 U/mL) from the constant 30 °C 
culture to the 6 h heat shock culture, while the 20 h heat 
shock culture showed 2.5  U/mL (Fig.  6B). However, the 
20 h heat shock culture also showed a strongly reduced 
OD600, indicating that a large part of this supernatant 
esterase activity may originate from lysed cells. For the 
6  h heat shock culture we observed a mildly decreased 
OD600 value, while the 0 h, 2 h and 4 h cultures showed 
a growth behavior just slightly below empty vector con -
trols. Thus, it appeared that shifting P. putida cultures 
from 25 °C to 30 °C is sufficient to induce good expres -
sion from  PIbpA, while a 2 to 4  h heat shock at 37  °C 
provides an additional small boost to expression levels 
without affecting cell fitness.
Genomic integration of PIbpA PET hydrolase expression 
constructs
In a final engineering step, we genomically integrated 
the  PIbpA-PET hydrolase expression constructs into 
our P. putida strains. We reasoned that this may lessen 
expression burden by reducing construct copy num -
ber to one, may lead to better culture stability as poten -
tial plasmid loss is avoided, and circumvents constant 
antibiotic selection for plasmid maintenance, all factors 
that may contribute to better plastic degradation per -
formance of long-term cultures. We chose the pBAMD 
system for genomic integration and constructed plas -
mids encoding integration cassettes for  PIbpA-EhaA-LCC, 
 PIbpA-bglx-HiC, and  PIbpA-lasb-IsPDura. The cassettes were 
knocked into P. putida KT2440 and strains TA7-EG and 
Page 13 of 31
Brandenberg et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2022) 21:119 
 
TA7-BD. Single colonies were then tested in shake flask 
cultures for their growth characteristics and PET hydro -
lase expression following a heat shock, and the best-
performing clones were whole-genome sequenced to 
identify the expression cassette’s integration site and to 
ensure absence of undesired mutations (Additional file  1: 
Tables S1, 2).
First, we investigated the induction behavior of the 
genomically integrated  PIbpA constructs, using P. putida  
KT2440 and the corresponding  PIbpA-EhaA-LCC, 
 PIbpA-bglx-HiC and  PIbpA-lasb-Isp knock-in strains. 
Shake flask cultures in LB medium were subjected 
to constant 30 °C or heat shocks at 37 °C for 2 or 6 h, 
followed by a recovery phase at 30 °C and subsequent 
analysis of OD600 and esterase activity (Fig.  7A). As for 
plasmid-based expression, we observed the best super -
natant esterase signal for  PIbpA-bglx-HiC, showing a 
fourfold induction over P. putida KT2440 for the con -
stant 30 °C culture, 16-fold for the 2 h heat shock, and 
over 60-fold (up to 0.95 U/mL) for the 6 h heat shock, 
while maintaining growth comparable to the wt control 
(Fig.  7B). For  PIbpA-EhaA-LCC and  PIbpA-lasb-Isp Dura, 
we observed lower induction levels (2 to 4-fold over

wt) while also recording slightly reduced OD600. Simi -
lar results were obtained for the equivalent  PIbpA-PET 
hydrolase knock-ins in strains P. putida TA7-EG and 
TA7-BD (data not shown).
We confirmed secretory HiC expression from the 
plasmid-based pLo-P IbpA-bglx-HiC construct by SDS-
PAGE and LC–MS analysis (Additional file  1: Fig. S18). 
However, SDS-PAGE was not sensitive enough to unam -
biguously confirm secretory expression of HiC from the 
genomically integrated  PIbpA-bglx-HiC cassette or plas -
mid-based expression of IsP from pLo-P IbpA-lasb-IsPDura. 
This underscores the high secretory activity seen for the 
bglx-HiC construct, as well as the desired effect of modu-
lating expression levels through plasmid-based versus 
genomic expression.
Next, we directly compared absolute PET hydrolase 
expression levels across constructs, using the surface 
display construct EhaA-LCC (Additional file  1: Fig. S19). 
EhaA-LCC expression from pLo-PrhaB-EhaA-LCC yielded 
a cell-associated esterase activity of 1.4 U/mL (100-
fold over empty vector), measured 3  h post-induction 
(before culture collapse). EhaA-LCC expression from

representative experiment with duplicate cultures

Brandenberg et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2022) 21:119 
 
pLo-PIbpA-EhaA-LCC after a 2  h, 37  °C heat shock fol -
lowed by outgrowth at 30  °C for 18  h delivered 0.26 U/
mL of cell-associated esterase activity, fivefold lower than 
the expression output from pLo-P rhaB-EhaA-LCC. EhaA-
LCC expression from the genomically integrated  PIbpA 
construct under the same induction regime delivered 
0.08 U/mL, 18-fold lower compared to plasmid-based 
 PrhaB-dependent expression and threefold lower than 
plasmid-based expression from the same  PIbpA promoter. 
At the same time, while plasmid-based  PrhaB expression 
cultures collapsed a few hours after induction, plas -
mid-based  PIbpA-EhaA-LCC cultures showed reduced 
but stable OD600, while the genomically integrated 
 PIbpA-EhaA-LCC constructs showed an OD600 not far 
below the control strain. Thus, our engineering strategy 
succeeded in balancing PET hydrolase expression levels 
with cell viability, but at the cost of lower absolute PET 
hydrolase expression output.
A central feature of synthetic PETtrophy would be the 
bacterial ability to efficiently express PET hydrolases with 
only TA and EG (or TA and BD in case of PBAT) as car -
bon sources. Thus, we compared PET hydrolase expres -
sion of strains P. putida KT2440, TA7-EG and TA7-BD 
with the integrated  PIbpA-bglx-HiC cassette in either LB 
medium or M9 minimal medium (Fig.  8). Both over -
all cell growth (OD600) and esterase activity were dra -
matically reduced in M9 minimal medium, especially 
for strains TA7-EG and TA7-BD, where we recorded 
only twofold inductions of supernatant esterase activity 
(compared to ca. 30 to 50-fold induction in LB medium) 
over the control strains. Thus, PET hydrolase expression 
in minimal medium is detectable but strongly reduced, 
likely reflecting the lower energetic value of the polyester 
monomers compared to complete medium.
Assessing PET and PBAT degradation by P . putida PIbpA‑PET 
hydrolase strains
In a final step, we assessed the capacity of our engineered 
strains to degrade PET or PBAT plastics and maintain 
synthetic PETtrophy. Plastic samples included amor -
phous PET film, commercial PET bottle chips, high-
crystallinity PET powder, polyester garment fibers, and a 
commercial PBAT-starch-polylactic acid (PLA) copoly -
mer film. We tested different culture formats to bring 
plastic samples in contact with bacterial cultures, includ -
ing static cultures in 14-mL tubes, 10-cm Petri dishes, 
or 6-well plates, and shaking cultures in 14-mL tubes or 
125-mL flasks. Overall, we obtained the most promising 
results with 15-mL shaking cultures in 125-mL flasks at 
a shake rate of 75  rpm. We also tested different culture 
media, including LB medium (to assess maximal PET 
hydrolase expression and plastic degradation capacity), 
M9 minimal medium supplemented with 20 mM TA (to 
mimic high monomer supply through efficient plastic 
degradation), and M9 minimal medium without added 
carbon source (to test for synthetic PETtrophy). Typical 
PET hydrolase culture induction regimes as previously 
established for the  PIbpA promoter consisted of a 2 h heat 
shock at 37 °C per day, with the remaining time at 25 °C.
We maintained cultures for up to 6 weeks; in this time -
frame, we were unable to reliably detect synthetic PETtro-
phy, i.e., the bacterial capacity to proliferate on polyester 
plastics as sole carbon source. We predominantly used 
OD600 measurements to assess bacterial growth, sup -
plemented with visual culture inspection by eye, stereo 
microscopy, and optical microscopy. While we occasion -
ally observed biofilm-like structures and live bacteria in 
cultures that were several weeks old (potentially stem -
ming from the inoculum), this typically did not manifest 
as reliably detectable OD600 increases and did not result 
in reproducible weight loss of plastic substrates.
In contrast, in nutrient-supplemented cultures (either 
LB or M9-TA), we detected modifications of the plastic 
substrates. For PET, we typically observed only minor 
changes: for example, after 6  days of culturing in LB 
medium with strain P. putida KT2440  PIbpA-bglx-HiC, 
we observed fraying along the edges of an amorphous 
PET film and a weight loss in the range of 1.5%, neither 
of which was observed in control cultures of P. putida 
KT2440 (Additional file  1: Fig. S20). For PBAT-starch-
PLA copolymer film, results were more pronounced: 
after 6  days of culturing in LB medium with strain P. 
putida KT2440  PIbpA-bglx-HiC, we observed fraying and 
tearing of the film and a weight loss of approximately 
25%, neither of which was observed in control cultures 
of P. putida KT2440 (Fig.  9A). Furthermore, in a 4-week 
culture in M9-TA medium with strain P. putida TA7-BD 
 PIbpA-bglx-HiC, we observed a striking decay of the film 
to parts smaller than 5  mm alongside a weight loss in 
the range of 40% (Fig.  9B, C). Scanning electron micros -
copy (SEM) of film samples showed surface erosion

TA7-BD  PIbpA-bglx-HiC treated samples, matching the 
observed increase in film brittleness and decay (Fig.  9D, 
E). Despite the apparent activity of the secreted HiC 
hydrolase on the PBAT copolymer film, we did not detect 
sustained growth of P. putida TA7-BD  PIbpA-bglx-HiC in 
M9 medium supplied with PBAT copolymer film as only 
carbon source. Potentially, this is due to the reported 
mediocre activity of HiC on PBAT oligomers, which may 
fail to supply TA and BD monomers for cellular catabo -
lism [69, 70]. Indeed, we did not detect TA in the culture 
medium by high performance liquid chromatography, 
likely because the small amounts of potentially released 
TA were quickly consumed by the engineered strains. 
While these observations hint towards the polyester plas-
tic degradation potential of our strains, they also high -
light future work required to fine-tune and improve PET 
hydrolase expression levels, culture conditions, and cel -
lular fitness.
Discussion
In this work, we followed a two-tiered strategy towards 
endowing Pseudomonas putida with the ability to utilize 
PET or PBAT plastics as sole carbon sources. First, we 
used metabolic engineering and adaptive laboratory evo -
lution to allow P. putida to catabolize the PET or PBAT 
monomers TA, EG and BD. Second, we tested various 
expression systems to achieve stable secretion or mem -
brane display of PET hydrolases. The resulting monomer-
metabolizing and PET hydrolase-expressing P. putida 
strains were tested in different culture setups to assess 
their plastic degradation capacity. While this approach 
yielded mixed results and we did not, to date, observe 
synthetic PETtrophy, we derived important insights into 
the factors governing (and limiting) the efficiency of 
potential whole-cell biocatalytic systems for polyester 
plastic degradation and assimilation.
Engineering P. putida for catabolism of polyester mon -
omers TA, EG and BD is an active field of research, and 
different groups recently disclosed approaches similar 
to the results reported here. Werner et  al. utilized the 
same tphII operon from Comamonas sp. E6, in combi -
nation with a TA transporter (tpaK) from Rhodococcus 
jostii, to install TA metabolism in P. putida [24]. Simi -
larly, Narancic et  al. recently transferred a homologous 
operon (including the TA transporter tphK) from the 
native TA metabolizer Pseudomonas umsongensis GO16 
to P. putida, again enabling it to use TA as sole carbon 
source [71]. Together with our results, this demonstrates 
that the tphA1, A2, A3, and B genes of tph-type oper -
ons are sufficient to enable TA catabolism by P. putida.

Notably, our work differs from the other two studies by 
omitting a TA transporter from the genomic knock-in 
cassette. Instead, the native P. putida transporter MhpT 
with a L374V point mutation functions as a putative TA 
transporter.  MhpTL374V may prove useful for future engi -
neering efforts, as its expression may come with a lower 
fitness cost compared to the expression of a heterolo -
gous membrane transporter. Additional work is needed 
to unravel the  MhpTL374V TA uptake mechanism and its 
regulation of expression (e.g., the role of the accompany -
ing R51C mutation in the MarR-family transcription fac -
tor PP_3359).
For EG, previous research has established that ALE 
can rapidly result in loss-of-function mutations in the 
transcriptional repressor GclR, thereby enabling effi -
cient utilization of EG as sole carbon source by P. putida 
[42–44]. Our observation of P. putida strains carrying a 
likely GclR E130* loss-of-function mutation after ALE 
for EG utilization agrees with these studies. Similarly, 
Li et  al. recently demonstrated that ALE can enable P. 
putida to use BD as sole carbon source [45]. The under -
lying metabolic network is less clearly understood; how -
ever, apparent key mutations occur in the transcription 
factor PP_2046, which likely regulates expression of the 
PP_2047-2051 operon involved in BD metabolism [45]. 
In line with this, upon performing ALE for BD utiliza -
tion, we obtained a strain carrying a mutation, V136A, in 
PP_2046. We did not attempt to engineer metabolism of 
adipic acid, the second PBAT aliphatic monomer; how -
ever, Ackermann et al. recently used metabolic engineer -
ing to allow P. putida to metabolize this compound as 
well [72]. In summary, this body of work highlights the 
potential of P. putida as a bacterial chassis for polyester 
plastic monomer metabolization and upcycling, as cur -
rently pursued by several research groups.
To install polyester plastic depolymerization capabili -
ties into our P. putida strains, we explored the expres -
sion of Ideonella sakaiensis PETase (IsP) [26], Humicola 
insolens cutinase (HiC) [57], and leaf compost cutinase 
(LCC) [58]. We reasoned that by testing this diverse set 
of enzymes we would maximize our chances of achiev -
ing stable expression and catalytic function in our P. 
putida strains. Both LCC and HiC have been described 
to completely depolymerize PET to TA and EG. On the 
other hand, IsP produces only small amounts of TA and 
predominantly releases the degradation intermediate 
product mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET), 
which is subsequently hydrolyzed to TA and EG by the I. 
sakaiensis auxiliary enzyme MHETase [26]. Interestingly, 
recent studies of IsP expression in green algae found that, 
upon prolonged incubation, TA accumulates in PET deg-
radation cultures [59, 73]. However, it is currently unclear 
whether this MHET degradation activity originates from 
IsP or from unknown proteins of the microalgal hosts. 
In this study, we chose to express IsP without MHETase 
to establish baseline conditions for stable IsP expression 
and to facilitate direct comparisons with HiC and LCC.
We used rapid design-build-test-learn cycles to explore 
PET hydrolase expression, and relied on assessing the 
activity of expressed PET hydrolases with the spectro -
photometric surrogate assay of para-nitrophenyl butyrate 
(pNPB) cleavage. While this assay offers fast results and 
is easy to scale, IsP shows markedly lower activity on pNP 
alkanoate esters than do HiC and LCC [26]. Thus, with -
out precise enzyme quantification (which was not feasi -
ble for the many small-scale expression cultures typically 
performed here), it was occasionally unclear whether the 
low pNPB esterase activity of IsP expression cultures was 
due to low enzyme expression or low IsP pNPB cleavage 
activity.
Our analyses of  PrhaB-driven PET hydrolase membrane 
display showed that EhaA and OprF membrane anchors 
yielded strong PET hydrolase cell surface expression but 
also resulted in subsequent culture collapse. The latter 
was not entirely surprising, as heterologous expression 
of membrane proteins frequently results in compromised 
cellular fitness [63, 64]. Indeed, the developers of the P. 
putida EhaA display system (in their study with an ester -
ase cargo and under control of the araBAD promoter) 
reported a 1000-fold reduction in cell viability following 
induction of expression [46]. Furthermore, they allowed 
expression to proceed for only 2  h before cell analysis; 
we speculate that the authors also encountered impaired 
cell integrity at later timepoints post-induction. The 
developers of the P. putida OprF display system (in their 
study with a lipase cargo and under control of the tac 
promoter) did not report cellular growth defects follow -
ing induction; however, we note that the authors used a 
relatively low IPTG inducer concentration (0.1 mM) and, 
again, a short expression window of only 4 h before cell 
analysis [49]. Neither of the two studies reported bacte -
rial growth curves following induction.
Secretory expression of the three PET hydrolases was 
achieved by screening a library comprising 30 SPs. As the 
joint effects of SP and enzyme cargo on secretion effi -
ciency are incompletely understood [60, 61], we believe 
that this screening approach was vital to identify suitable 
SPs for each PET hydrolase. Notably, the DNA oligo pool 
we used to clone the SP library came at a synthesis cost 
of only around 100 USD; thus, we argue that a screening 
strategy (as opposed to individual cloning and testing of 
selected SPs) represents a cost-effective and fast strategy 
to identify SPs for a given PET hydrolase (or other gene 
of interest), especially if a fast read-out such as the pNPB 
assay is available.

For both HiC and LCC we again observed impaired cell 
growth following secretion construct expression, while 
IsP secretion resulted in relatively mild growth defects. 
While we assessed cell fitness in the initial SP library 
screen and validated the best SP-PET hydrolase con -
structs in shake flask cultures, there is a small possibil -
ity that our screen did not identify the SPs resulting in 
the most efficient enzyme secretion, but rather those SPs 
inducing the fastest cell leakage. Thus, it would be inter -
esting to repeat the entire SP library screen with the heat-
inducible  PIbpA or cI857/P L promoter systems instead of 
the strong  PrhaB promoter, to determine if a lower, more 
sustainable construct expression would result in the same 
SPs coming out on top.
To ameliorate the problem of cell toxicity following 
PET hydrolase expression, we next substituted the  PrhaB 
promoter with the heat-inducible cI857/PL and  PIbpA pro-
moter systems. In agreement with the literature, cI857/PL 
required relatively harsh heat shocks (≥ 40 °C) for induc-
tion [67]. In contrast,  PIbpA was largely inactive at 25 °C, 
provided low expression at 30 °C, and good expression at 
37 °C, while also maintaining better cell fitness compared 
to  PrhaB expression constructs. Due to these favorable 
properties and it’s easily clonable size, Pseudomonas ori -
gin, and absence of auxiliary transcriptional regulators, 
we proceeded with the  PIbpA expression constructs.
In a final engineering step, we integrated the  PIbpA 
PET hydrolase expression constructs into the genome 
of our engineered P. putida strains. The resulting strains 
showed good PET hydrolase expression upon induction 
in complex medium, as well as good viability, likely due to 
reduced expression burden from a single genomic copy. 
On the other hand, we observed strongly reduced PET 
hydrolase expression from cultures in minimal medium 
containing TA, EG or BD as sole carbon sources. We 
believe that this imperfect balance between nutrient sup -
ply and PET hydrolase expression was a decisive factor 
in the lack of bacterial growth on plastics as sole carbon 
source, as discussed further below.
Across a wide range of test cultures, including differ -
ent PET or PBAT plastic samples and growth condi -
tions, we were unable to detect bacterial PETtrophy, that 
is, the envisioned capacity of our strains to depolymer -
ize polyester plastics while maintaining growth and PET 
hydrolase expression. The underlying reasons are likely 
manifold. First, the low culture temperature, in the range 
of 30–37  °C, likely poses a strong limitation, especially 
for HiC and LCC, given the much higher activity of these 
enzymes (and a higher absolute activity compared to IsP) 
at temperatures closer to the glass transition tempera -
ture of PET. For IsP-expressing strains, we would have 
expected to see better activity, especially on amorphous 
PET; however, the omittance of MHETase and thus lack 
of TA and EG supply may have compromised the effi -
ciency of our strains. Furthermore, despite our pro -
moter-tuning efforts, our strains likely still do not strike 
an ideal balance between PET hydrolase expression levels 
and the available monomer concentrations as released by 
PET hydrolase-catalyzed plastic depolymerization. This 
represents a chicken-and-egg problem: PET hydrolase 
expression requires plastic monomers as carbon sources; 
however, monomer production requires a certain mini -
mum PET hydrolase activity. This problem may be exac -
erbated by the comparatively low yield of central carbon 
metabolites obtained from PET monomers, as compared 
to typical sugar feedstocks or monomers of other plas -
tics [8]. In this context, it is also interesting to point out 
that the original Ideonella sakaiensis PET degradation 
cultures contained low amounts (0.01%) of yeast extract 
[26]. This may have served precisely the purpose out -
lined above, namely, to maintain a basal level of cellular 
metabolism ensuring PETase and MHETase expression. 
Lastly, we point out that we employed commonly used 
but rather simplistic methods to assess bacterial PETtro -
phy, such as measurements of culture OD600 and plas -
tic weight loss. It has been argued that such methods are 
unsuited for assessing biocatalytic plastic degradation, 
and indeed, more fine-grained techniques capable of 
detecting subtle changes in plastic composition or bacte -
rial growth rate are available [74, 75]. It would be inter -
esting to re-assess the plastic degradation and growth 
performance of our strains using more sensitive tech -
niques; however, at the same time, we argue that if such 
methods are necessary to detect bacterial growth and 
plastic degradation, the relevance of such a bacterial sys -
tem for delivering tangible solutions to the plastic waste 
problem is likely small.
How does our work compare to recent studies aiming 
to create whole-cell biocatalysts for PET plastic degrada -
tion? To date, I. sakaiensis remains the only bacterium 
with thoroughly characterized biochemical machinery 
capable of sustained growth on PET substrates, albeit 
with the caveat of requiring small amounts of extrane -
ously added complex medium [26]. In addition, several 
recent studies aimed to create whole-cell biocatalysts 
for PET biodegradation, complementing the more tra -
ditional approach of using purified PET hydrolases. In 
most cases, these studies aimed for recombinant PET 
hydrolase secretion or membrane display by microbial 
hosts; unfortunately, most of these studies lack detailed 
information on the fitness of the resulting recombinant 
strains, which proved to be a key factor in our work. Seo 
et al. demonstrated IsP secretion in E. coli by testing five 
different E. coli SPs; no information on the growth char -
acteristics of the recombinant strains was provided [76]. 
Similarly, Shi et al. expressed IsP in E. coli with the pelB 
Page 20 of 31Brandenberg et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2022) 21:119 
SP and variants thereof; while they do not comment on 
cell growth, we note that the supernatant of their expres -
sion strain shows a much higher overall concentration 
of proteins on SDS-PAGE compared to the empty vec -
tor control strain, which we interpret as indication of cell 
leakage or lysis [77]. Cui et al. also expressed IsP in E. coli 
using short ‘enhancer’ peptides fused to standard SPs; 
they provide culture OD600 for their expression strains, 
but lack crucial empty vector or uninduced controls [78]. 
Huang et  al. demonstrated IsP secretion by the com -
monly used gram-positive secretion host Bacillus subti-
lis using the native IsP SP; growth curves of recombinant 
strains were provided and showed no significant growth 
defects compared to controls [79]. Similarly, Wang et al. 
showed secretory expression of IsP in B. subtilis, using a 
weak constitutive promoter and testing five different SPs; 
they additionally performed bacterial growth tests at 22°, 
28° and 37 °C and documented culture OD600, but unfor-
tunately lacked an empty vector control strain for com -
parison [80]. Moog et al. showed secretory expression of 
 IsPR280A in the microalgae Phaeodactylum tricornutum, 
using a P. tricornutum SP; while not providing growth 
curves of the recombinant strains, they controlled for cell 
lysis (and reported none) by measuring the cytoplasmic 
marker alpha-tubulin in the culture supernatant [59]. 
They report PET and PETG degradation by the micro -
algal cultures under certain conditions, but also provide 
the valuable information that several degradation setups 
were unsuccessful, possibly due to low reaction tempera -
tures (21–26 °C), culture agitation, or different character-
istics of the PET substrates. Kim et al. also expressed IsP 
in a green algae, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, but used 
an intracellular expression system necessitating cell lysis 
for PET degradation assays; they do not provide growth 
curves of their recombinant strains [73]. Yan et al. showed 
secretory expression of LCC in the thermophilic bacte -
rium Clostridium thermocellum, using a C. thermocellum 
SP; they show a growth curve for their engineered strain, 
but also lack appropriate controls [81]. Notably, they also 
report that LCC is only actively produced in the first day 
of a 14-day culture due to subsequent medium deple -
tion. Regarding membrane display, Chen et al. displayed 
IsP on the surface of the yeast Pichia pastoris, testing 
three P. pastoris glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored 
proteins as display system; they report similar growth of 
their recombinant strains compared to a wt control [82]. 
Lastly, Heyde et al. recently explored IsP surface display 
on E. coli, using the Lpp-OmpA or C-IgAP display sys -
tems; they do not provide information on cell fitness fol -
lowing construct expression [83].
Thus, while secretion or membrane display of PET 
hydrolases is a growing field, there is unfortunately 
often only very limited information on the effects of 
such expression systems on host fitness (a trend we 
observe across the general protein secretion or mem -
brane display literature). While host fitness may not 
be relevant for many biochemical applications, such 
information is crucial to establishing continuous bio -
processing-like applications as aimed for in this study. 
Furthermore, if host growth characteristics are not 
controlled for, especially in enzyme secretion systems, 
one may confound the accumulation of the target pro -
tein in the culture supernatant as ‘secretion’ , when it 
may originate instead from cell leakage or lysis. Thus, 
we advocate for assessment and reporting of host fit -
ness for any newly developed enzyme secretion or 
membrane display system, including the critical com -
parison to the matched empty vector or wildtype strain. 
This will enable scientists aiming to establish continu -
ous bioprocessing-like processes to better gauge the 
suitability of each expression system for their purposes.
Finally, it remains to be discussed whether pursuing 
PET continuous bioprocessing using a mesophilic bac -
terium is a promising strategy. A PET continuous bio -
processing workflow would need to incorporate both 
PET degradation through hydrolase expression and 
efficient monomer metabolization, of which the for -
mer is likely the more challenging part. We chose to 
use P. putida due to the ease of engineering PET mon -
omer metabolization, and subsequently tackled PET 
hydrolase expression. However, given the strict rela -
tionship between reaction temperature and PET hydro -
lase degradation performance, it may be promising to 
first establish PET hydrolase expression in a thermo -
philic host, and subsequently engineer it for monomer 
metabolism [81]. Recent progress in the development 
of genetic tools and knowledge for metabolic engineer -
ing of thermophiles will undoubtedly prove useful for 
such endeavors [84, 85]. Nevertheless, we argue that a 
mesophilic, self-sustaining PET degrading bacterium 
as pursued here may still have significant value. First, 
by creating such an organism, we may learn about the 
determinants of bacterial growth on PET in mesophilic 
environments. Second, such organisms may prove use -
ful for non-commercial approaches in which speed of 
degradation is less decisive, for example for small-scale, 
decentralized PET waste composting facilities. In this 
regard, it would be very interesting to perform eco -
nomic process modelling analyses for a putative whole-
cell biocatalytic PET recycling process, as recently 
performed by Singh et al. for a recycling process based 
on purified enzyme [9 ], to better gauge the potential 
merits of such a system. We look forward to seeing how 
the next generation of highly efficient PET hydrolases, 
Page 21 of 31
Brandenberg et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2022) 21:119 
 
such as DuraPETase [20], FastPETase [21], or the LCC 
ICCG variant [19], may be leveraged in the future to 
develop whole-cell biocatalytic strategies as novel solu -
tions for the PET waste problem.
Conclusions
What does it take to engineer a mesophilic bacterium 
for growth on polyester plastics? Here, we addressed this 
question using the industrial workhorse organism Pseu -
domonas putida. Together with other recent studies, our 
work shows that polyester plastic monomer metabolism 
is readily achievable using genetic engineering and adap -
tive laboratory evolution. On the other hand, attaining 
high-level extracellular expression and activity of PET 
hydrolases remains a challenge. Our work of testing a 
variety of expression systems to balance host cell fit -
ness with PET hydrolase expression may prove useful for 
future efforts aiming to establish extracellular enzyme 
expression in P. putida, and in particular for efforts 
geared towards establishing synthetic PETtrophy in mes -
ophilic bacterial hosts.
Materials and methods
General reagents, procedures, and bacterial culturing 
conditions
Bacterial strains, plasmids, and DNA oligos used in this 
study are listed in Additional file  1: Tables S5, 6, and 7. 
Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas putida strains were 
routinely grown in LB medium (10 g tryptone, 5 g yeast 
extract, 5  g NaCl per liter  ddH2O, pH 7.0) at 37  °C or 
30  °C, supplemented with antibiotics where needed 
(Ampicillin (Amp): 100 µg/mL; Kanamycin (Kan): 50 µg/
mL). Adaptive laboratory evolution and assays with P. 
putida strains for growth on terephthalic acid, ethyl -
ene glycol, 1,4-butanediol, PET, and PBAT, were per -
formed in modified M9 minimal medium: 47.7  mM 
 Na2HPO4·7H2O, 22  mM  KH2PO4, 18.7  mM  NH4Cl, 
8.5  mM NaCl, 2  mM  MgSO4, 0.1  mM  CaCl2, 1× trace 
metals (Teknova 1000× trace metals mixture), and vary -
ing pH (adjusted with NaOH or HCl) depending on the 
experiment. Bacteria were routinely cultured in 125 mL 
shake flasks (15 mL working volume) or 14 mL snap-cap 
tubes (2–4 mL working volume) at 250 rpm. Bacterial cul-
ture plates were prepared with 1.5% (w/v) agar. Expres -
sion of proteins under control of the  PrhaB promoter was 
induced by addition of a 1 M sterile rhamnose stock solu-
tion in  ddH2O to 2 mM final concentration, unless other-
wise indicated. Optical density (OD600) of cell cultures 
was measured in a Beckman-Coulter DU520 spectropho -
tometer. Bacterial growth in clear round-bottom 96-well 
plates was measured in a Biotek Synergy plate reader with 
constant shaking (set to the fastest shake rate, no rpm 
provided) at 30 °C, 100 μL volume per well, and OD600 
read-out in 15 min intervals; plates were sealed with clear 
Breathe-Easy membranes (Sigma-Aldrich). Plasmid DNA 
was prepared using Miniprep kits (Qiagen). DNA restric -
tion digests and ligations (with T4 DNA ligase) were per -
formed with enzymes from New England Biolabs (NEB). 
DNA fragment purification by gel extraction was per -
formed using Zymoclean gel DNA recovery kits (Zymo 
Research). High-fidelity PCR was performed using either 
Phusion DNA polymerase (NEB) or PfuUltra II Fusion 
DNA polymerase (Agilent). Analytical colony PCR was 
performed with Taq DNA polymerase (Takara). Gibson 
assembly was performed using Gibson Assembly Mas -
ter Mix (NEB). Bacterial transformation with plasmid 
DNA was achieved through electroporation (see below) 
or by chemical transformation using NEB 5-alpha E. coli 
(NEB) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. All 
plasmids were stored as glycerol stocks at − 80  °C in E. 
coli CC118 λpir (pBAMD1-2 and derivatives thereof) or 
E. coli NEB 5-alpha (all other plasmids). Synthetic DNA 
fragments and oligonucleotides were purchased from 
IDT. Sanger sequencing was performed by Laragen. 
Chemicals were obtained from Sigma. PBAT-starch-pol -
ylactic acid copolymer bags (Vove compostable sandwich 
bags) were obtained from Amazon. Commercial bottle 
PET was obtained from Evian water bottles. Amorphous 
PET film (0.25  mm thickness) and PET powder (≥ 40% 
crystallinity) were obtained from Goodfellow.
Preparation and transformation of electrocompetent cells
Electrocompetent E. coli and P. putida cells were pre -
pared by a modified standard protocol. Briefly, 250  mL 
of LB medium in a 1 L flask were inoculated with an E. 
coli or P. putida overnight culture to an OD600 of 0.05 
and incubated at 250  rpm and 37  °C or 30  °C, respec -
tively, until an OD600 of 0.5 was reached. Cells were 
cooled on ice, transferred to 250 mL centrifuge buckets, 
and pelleted at 4 °C, 3000g, 8 min. The supernatant was 
removed, the cells were gently resuspended by swirling 
in 50  mL sterile 10% ice-cold glycerol in  ddH2O, trans -
ferred to 50 mL tubes, and pelleted at 4 °C, 3000g, 8 min. 
The cell pellet then underwent two additional washing 
steps with 50 mL 10% glycerol, before resuspending the 
cells in 1 mL 10% glycerol. Aliquots of 50 μL were either 
used directly for electroporation or frozen on dry ice 
in 0.7 mL tubes and stored at − 80 °C. For transforma -
tion, 0.5 to 1.5 μL of plasmid DNA, ligation reaction or 
Gibson assembly were added to a cell aliquot on ice, and 
electroporation was performed using a BioRad Micro -
Pulser electroporator (Ec1 setting) and 1 mm gap width 
electroporation cuvettes (BioRad). SOC medium (600 μL; 
NEB) was added immediately following electroporation 
and cells were incubated at 37  °C or 30  °C (E. coli or P.

putida, respectively) for 1  h (3–5  h in case of pBAMD 
genomic knock-ins) before plating on selective LB-agar 
plates. We found that for all P. putida transformations, 
including pBAMD-based genomic knock-ins, electropo -
ration provided sufficient transformation rates and no 
conjugative plasmid transfer was necessary.
Plasmid construction
Cloning of the TA‑to‑PCA operon knock‑in vector 
pBAMD‑tphII.
The mini-Tn5 transposon plasmid pBAMD1-2 was 
digested with EcoRI and PshAI (thereby excising the  KanR 
selectable marker) and the vector fragment was purified 
by agarose gel extraction. To construct the TA-to-PCA 
operon, a synthetic DNA fragment containing the  PEM7 
promoter and BCD2 translational coupler [36] (Addi -
tional file  1: Sequence S1) was amplified using primers 
OB40 and OB51. In parallel, the codon-optimized syn -
thetic DNA fragments encoding tphA2 II, tphA3II, tphBII, 
and tphA1II from Comamonas sp. E6 (Additional file  1: 
Sequence S2–5) were amplified using primer pairs OB39 
and OB54, OB55 and OB56, OB57 and OB58, and OB59 
and OB53, respectively. This strategy introduced 32  bp 
intergenic regions between the four genes, each contain -
ing a strong ribosome binding site (ACG AGG ) [86]. In 
addition, the outmost primers (OB51 and OB53) intro -
duced overhangs homologous to pBAMD1-2 overlap -
ping the EcoRI and PshAI restriction sites. Following 
PCR and purification of the individual gene fragments, 
overlap extension PCR was used to splice together the 
 PEM7-BCD2, tphA2II, tphA3II fragments and the thpB II, 
tphA1II fragments, respectively. Next, the two resulting 
fragments were spliced together using overlap extension 
PCR to create the complete operon fragment. The frag -
ment was cloned into EcoRI/PshAI-digested pBAMD1-2 
using Gibson assembly, resulting in plasmid pBAMD-
tphII. E. coli CC118 λpir cells were transformed with the 
Gibson assembly mix by electroporation and cells were 
plated on LB-Amp agar plates. Plasmids isolated from 
single clones were analyzed by Sanger sequencing to ver -
ify correct assembly of the operon and absence of unde -
sired mutations.
Cloning of PET hydrolase expression plasmids.
(A) Cloning of expression vectors: To obtain a set of 
expression vectors harboring the rhaS-rhaR-P rhaB tran -
scriptional regulator for rhamnose-inducible protein 
expression and differing only in their replication system 
(and thus cellular copy number) we first transferred the 
rhaS-rhaR-PrhaB element from pPS39 to pSEVA328 and 
pSEVA338 using PacI and SpeI restriction sites, gen -
erating vectors pSEVA328-P rhaB and pSEVA338-P rhaB. 
Next, we obtained the DNA fragment encoding the Kan 
resistance marker from pBAMD1-2 through digest with 
SwaI and PshAI and inserted it into the equally digested 
pPS39, pSEVA338-P rhaB and pSEVA328-P rhaB, thereby 
obtaining plasmids pHi-P rhaB, pMe-P rhaB and pLo-P rhaB. 
To obtain a low copy number expression vector with the 
 PIbpA transcriptional/translational regulator, we ordered 
the  PIbpA fragment as a DNA oligo (Additional file  1: 
Sequence S6), which was then transformed into dsDNA 
and amplified by PCR using primers OB179 and OB192. 
Next, we PCR-amplified pLo-P rhaB as two separate frag -
ments, to simultaneously remove the rhaS-rhaR-P rhaB 
element and to remove a NdeI site in the replication 
protein trfA (I305; primer-encoded silent codon change 
ATA > ATC (antisense); CAT  ATG  > CAG ATG ); primers 
used were OB191 with OB189, and OB178 with OB190. 
The two resulting pLo vector fragments were fused and 
amplified using overlap extension PCR with outer prim -
ers OB178 and OB191. Next, the vector and  PIbpA frag -
ments were digested with PacI and NdeI and ligated to 
obtain pLo-P IbpA. To obtain a low copy number expres -
sion vector with the cI857/P L transcriptional regulator, 
the cI857/PL element was ordered as synthetic DNA frag-
ment (Additional file  1: Sequence S7) and amplified with 
primers OB182 and OB183. Next, the resulting fragment 
was digested with PacI and AvrII and ligated into equally 
digested pLo-PrhaB to obtain pLo-PL.
(B) Cloning of PET hydrolase membrane display con -
structs. (i) Cloning of OprF display constructs: A 100 bp 
BCD2 translational coupler fragment was amplified from 
a synthetic DNA fragment (Additional file  1: Sequence 
S8) with primers OB85 and OB91. Next, the OprF frag -
ment including a C-terminal  G4SG2S(G4S)3 linker [47] 
was amplified from a synthetic DNA fragment (Addi -
tional file 1: Sequence S9) with primers OB92 and OB93. 
The BCD2 and OprF fragments were fused and further 
amplified by overlap extension PCR with outer primers 
OB85 and OB93. The resulting fragment was digested 
with AvrII and HindIII and ligated into equally digested 
pHi-PrhaB, pMe-PrhaB and pLo-P rhaB, generating plasmids 
pHi-PrhaB-OprF, pMe-P rhaB-OprF and pLo-P rhaB-OprF. 
Next, synthetic DNA fragments encoding LCC (Addi -
tional file  1: Sequence S8, primers OB85 and OB86), 
HiC (Additional file  1: Sequence S10, primers OB94 and 
OB95) and IsP (Additional file  1: Sequence S11, prim -
ers OB132 and OB133) were amplified by PCR, digested 
with PstI and NcoI, and ligated into equally digested 
pHi-PrhaB-OprF, pMe-P rhaB-OprF and pLo-P rhaB-OprF 
(note, IsP was only cloned into pLo-P rhaB-OprF). This 
generated plasmids pHi-P rhaB-OprF-LCC, pHi-P rhaB-
OprF-HiC, pMe-P rhaB-OprF-LCC, pMe-P rhaB-OprF-
HiC, pLo-P rhaB-OprF-LCC, pLo-P rhaB-OprF-HiC, and 
pLo-PrhaB-OprF-IsP . (ii) Cloning of EhaA display con -
structs: The codon-optimized synthetic EhaA DNA

fragment (Additional file  1: Sequence S12) including an 
N-terminal  G4SG2S(G4S)3 linker was PCR-amplified 
with primers OB87 and OB88. A synthetic codon-opti -
mized DNA fragment (Additional file  1: Sequence S8) 
encoding the N-terminal BCD2 translational coupler 
followed by residues 1–37 of P. putida OprF, a 6xHis 
tag, PstI restriction site, residues 35–293 of LCC and a 
NcoI restriction site was amplified by PCR using prim -
ers OB85 and OB86. Next, the EhaA and LCC fragments 
were fused and further amplified by overlap extension 
PCR with outer primers OB85 and OB88 (5% DMSO 
were added to the PCR mix to ensure efficient amplifica -
tion across GC-rich regions). The resulting fragment was 
digested with AvrII and HindIII and ligated into equally 
digested pHi-P rhaB, pMe-P rhaB and pLo-P rhaB, generating 
plasmids pHi-P rhaB-EhaA-LCC, pMe-P rhaB-EhaA-LCC 
and pLo-P rhaB-EhaA-LCC. To generate the correspond -
ing EhaA-HiC and EhaA-IsP constructs, the LCC frag -
ment was excised from these plasmids with PstI and NcoI 
and replaced with equally digested HiC and IsP ORF 
fragments (see OprF cloning above) (note, IsP was only 
cloned into pLo-P rhaB-EhaA). (iii) Cloning of InaV-NC 
display constructs: A 100 bp BCD2 translational coupler 
fragment was amplified from a synthetic DNA fragment 
(Additional file  1: Sequence S8) with primers OB85 and 
OB91. Next, the InaV-NC fragment including a C-termi -
nal  G4SG2S(G4S)3 linker was amplified from a synthetic 
DNA fragment (Additional file  1: Sequence S13) with 
primers OB89 and OB90. The BCD2 and InaV-NC frag -
ments were fused and amplified by overlap extension 
PCR with outer primers OB85 and OB89. The resulting 
fragment was digested with AvrII and HindIII and ligated 
into equally digested pHi-P rhaB, pMe-PrhaB and pLo-PrhaB, 
generating plasmids pHi-P rhaB-InaV, pMe-PrhaB-InaV and 
pLo-PrhaB-InaV. Next, synthetic DNA fragments encoding 
LCC (Additional file  1: Sequence S8, primers OB85 and 
OB86) and HiC (Additional file  1: Sequence S11, prim -
ers OB94 and OB95) were amplified by PCR, digested 
with PstI and NcoI, and ligated into equally digested 
pHi-PrhaB-InaV, pMe-PrhaB-InaV and pLo-PrhaB-InaV. This 
generated plasmids pHi-PrhaB-InaV-LCC, pHi-PrhaB-InaV-
HiC, pMe-P rhaB-InaV-LCC, pMe-P rhaB-InaV-HiC, pLo-
PrhaB-InaV-LCC, and pLo-PrhaB-InaV-HiC.
(C) Cloning of PET hydrolase secretion constructs. First, 
we excised the EhaA coding sequence from pLo-P rhaB-
EhaA-LCC with NcoI and HindIII. Next, we used PCR to 
generate a short 85 bp linker fragment from overlapping 
oligonucleotides OB121 and OB122, spanning across the 
NcoI and HindIII sites and introducing a stop codon after 
the LCC coding sequence and NcoI site. Gibson assembly 
was used to repair the pLo-P rhaB-EhaA-LCC NcoI/Hin -
dIII-digested vector fragment with this linker fragment, 
resulting in plasmid pLo-P rhaB-SP(OprF)-LCC. Next, we 
used site-directed mutagenesis with primer pair OB134 
and OB135 to introduce a silent mutation creating a 
unique BbsI site at the C-terminal end of the BCD2 trans-
lational coupler (V16, GTT to GTC). This generated plas-
mid pLo-P rhaB-SPswitch-LCC, allowing facile exchange 
of the N-terminal SP preceding the LCC coding region 
using the BbsI/PstI restriction sites. We next generated 
analogous plasmids pLo-P rhaB-SPswitch-HiC and pLo-
PrhaB-SPswitch-IsP by digesting pLo-P rhaB-SPswitch-LCC 
with PstI and NcoI to excise the LCC coding sequence 
and replacing it with equally digested HiC and IsP coding 
fragments obtained from pLo-P rhaB-EhaA-HiC and pLo-
PrhaB-EhaA-Isp. To clone a library of different signal pep -
tides (SPs) into the LCC, HiC, and IsP SPswitch vectors, 
we ordered a 30-member SP library as oligonucleotides 
(oPool) from IDT (Additional file 1: Table S3). The library 
was transformed into dsDNA and further amplified by 
PCR with outer primers OB136 and OB137. Next, the SP 
library and plasmids pLo-PrhaB-SPswitch-LCC, pLo-PrhaB-
SPswitch-HiC, and pLo-PrhaB-SPswitch-IsP were digested 
with BbsI and PstI and the SP library was ligated into the 
vector fragments. E. coli NEB5α cells were transformed 
with the ligation reactions and serial dilutions plated on 
LB-Kan plates and incubated o/n. The next day, colonies 
from a dense plate (> 250 colonies) for each construct 
were washed off with 5  mL LB and directly processed 
by Miniprep; the isolated plasmid library was stored at 
-20  °C and used to transform P. putida for subsequent 
SP library screening. In parallel, plasmid DNA isolated 
from five single colonies per library was sent for sequenc-
ing to verify the cloning procedure and SP library diver -
sity. Individual SP-PET hydrolase plasmids as listed in 
Additional file  1: Table  S5 were obtained after library 
screening.
(D) Cloning of PET hydrolase cytoplasmic expression 
plasmids. To obtain plasmids for cytoplasmic expression 
of PET hydrolases (without membrane anchor or signal 
peptide), the LCC, HiC, and IsP ORFs including a 6xHis 
tag at the C-terminus were PCR-amplified from pLo-
PrhaB-OprF-LCC, pLo-P rhaB-OprF-HiC, and pLo-P rhaB-
OprF-IsP with primer pairs OB139 and OB211, OB139 
and OB210, and OB139 and OB209, respectively. The 
fwd primers introduced a BbsI restriction site match -
ing the site in the pLo-P rhaB-SPswitch vectors, while the 
reverse primer introduced a HindIII site. The PCR frag -
ments were digested with BbsI and HindIII and ligated 
into equally digested pLo-P rhaB-SPswitch-LCC to gener -
ate pLo-PrhaB-LCC, pLo-PrhaB-HiC, and pLo-PrhaB-IsP .
(E) Cloning of PET hydrolases into heat-shock promoter 
plasmids. To obtain the EhaA-LCC display construct 
under control of  PL, the pLo-P rhaB-EhaA-LCC plasmid 
was digested with PacI and AvrII to excise the rhaR-rhaS-
PrhaB element, which was then replaced with the equally 
Page 24 of 31Brandenberg et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2022) 21:119 
digested cI857/P L element (obtained from pLo-P L) to 
generate pLo-PL-EhaA-LCC. To obtain the secreted bglx-
HiC construct under control of  PL, pLo-PL was digested 
with AvrII and HindIII. The bglx-HiC fragment (includ -
ing the BCD2 translational coupler) was obtained from 
pLo-PrhaB-bglx-HiC by AvrII/HindIII digest and ligated 
into the equally digested pLo-P L fragment to obtain 
pLo-PL-bglx-HiC. To obtain the EhaA-LCC display con -
struct under control of  PIbpA, the EhaA-LCC fragment 
was obtained by PCR with primers OB201 and OB139 
using pLo-P rhaB-EhaA-LCC as template. pLo-P IbpA was 
digested with NdeI and HindIII, and the EhaA-LCC frag -
ment was ligated into the vector using Gibson assembly, 
providing pLo-P IbpA-EhaA-LCC. To obtain the secreted 
bglx-HiC and lasB-IsP constructs under control of  PIbpA, 
both ORFs were amplified by PCR using primer pairs 
OB197 and OB139 and pLo-P rhaB-bglx-HiC as template, 
and primer pairs OB195 and OB139 and pLo-P rhaB-lasb-
IsP as template, respectively. The PCR fragments were 
digested with NdeI and HindIII and ligated into equally 
digested pLo-P IbpA, yielding pLo-P IbpA-bglx-HiC and 
pLo-PIbpA-lasb-IsP . To obtain pLo-PIbpA-lasb-IsPDura, the 
 PIbpA-IsPDura fragment was amplified from a synthetic 
DNA fragment (Additional file  1: Sequence S14) using 
primer pair OB220 and OB221, digested with PacI and 
HindIII, and cloned into equally digested pLo-PIbpA.
Cloning of  PIbpA‑PET hydrolase genomic knock‑in vectors.
To obtain plasmids for genomic knock-in of  PIbpA-PET 
hydrolase expression systems we used pBAMD1-2. 
For secreted constructs, we first PCR-amplified the 
 PIbpA-bglx-HiC and  PIbpA-lasb-IsPDura cassettes from their 
pLo-based expression plasmids (see above) using primer 
pairs OB143 and OB205, and OFB220 and OFB205, 
respectively. The PCR products and pBAMD1-2 were 
then digested with SacI and HindIII and ligated to yield 
pBAMD-PIbpA-bglx-HiC and pBAMD-P IbpA-lasb-IsP-
Dura. For  PIbpA-EhaA-LCC we used a Gibson assembly 
strategy due to the presence of a SacI site in LCC. The 
 PIbpA-EhaA-LCC cassette was PCR-amplified from the 
corresponding pLO plasmid (see above) using primer 
pair OB119 and OB214. The resulting fragment was 
cloned into SacI/HindIII digested pBAMD1-2 using Gib -
son assembly to yield pBAMD-P IbpA-EhaA-LCC. In con -
trast to pBAMD-tphII, all  PIbpA-PET hydrolase knock-in 
vectors retained the Kan resistance marker to allow selec-
tion of transformants. We also cloned the corresponding 
pBAMD-PL-PET hydrolase constructs, however, they 
consistently showed very low knock-in efficiencies and 
are not discussed in the main text; details are available on 
request.
Cloning of mhpT expression vectors.
mhpTwt and mhpT L374V ORFs were amplified from 
genomic DNA of P. putida TA and P. putida TA7 by PCR 
using primer pair OB109 and OB110. The fwd primer 
OB109 introduced an AvrII restriction site and a strong 
ribosome binding site (ACG AGG ) in front of the mhpT  
ATG, while the rev primer OB110 introduced a HindIII 
restriction site after the mhpT stop codon. The fragments 
were digested with AvrII and HindIII and ligated into 
equally digested pMe-P rhaB, generating plasmids pMe-
PrhaB-mhpTwt and pMe-PrhaB-mhpTL374V.
Metabolic engineering and adaptive laboratory evolution 
of P . putida strains
Engineering TA‑to‑PCA catabolism
To knock-in the TA-to-PCA cassette into P . putida, 50 μL 
of electrocompetent P. putida KT2440 cells were trans -
formed with pBAMD-tphII (75  ng) and incubated in 
600 μL SOC medium for 3 h at 30 °C and 250 rpm. The 
cells were pelleted (3000g, 3 min), resuspended in 1 mL 
M9 medium, and added to 25 mL M9 medium, pH 5.5, 
0.4% w/v TA, in a 125 mL flask. The culture was incubated 
at 30  °C, 250  rpm, until after ca. 36  h noticeable bacte -
rial growth was observed. The culture was subsequently 
passaged daily for 10  days (dilution to OD600 = 0.01 in 
15 mL fresh M9-TA medium), at which point the culture 
was streaked on LB-agar plates to obtain single colo -
nies. Five clones were processed and analyzed by PCR 
as described by Garcia-Martinez et al. [87] to determine 
the genomic integration site; primers used were OB96 
and OB105 (5’ end, outer primers), OB97 and OB104 
(5’ end, inner primers), OB96 and OB102 (3’ end, outer 
primers) and OB97 and OB103 (3’ end, inner primers). 
The resulting DNA fragments spanning over the 5’ and 
3’ integration sites were sequenced using primers OB104 
and OB103, respectively; all five clones showed the same 
integration site, indicating that the knock-in culture was 
dominated by a single clone likely originating from the 
same integration event. Growth of one selected clone on 
TA as sole carbon source was verified and the variant was 
designated as strain P. putida TA.
ALE for growth of P . putida TA at pH 7
To adapt P. putida strain TA with the genomically inte -
grated TA-to-PCA cassette for better growth at higher 
pH, 25 mL of M9 pH 7.0, 0.4% w/v TA were inoculated 
with 0.5  mL of the P. putida TA-to-PCA knock-in cul -
ture after 10 days of passaging (see above) and cultured 
at 30  °C, 250  rpm. After 7  days (6 total passages), sig -
nificantly better bacterial growth was observed and the 
culture was streaked out on LB-agar plates to obtain 
single colonies. Three clones were tested for growth in 
Page 25 of 31
Brandenberg et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2022) 21:119 
 
M9, 0.4% TA at different pH in comparison to P. putida 
TA; the best-performing clone was designated strain P. 
putida TA7 and subjected to whole-genome sequencing 
together with P. putida TA to identify potential genetic 
changes.
ALE for co‑utilization of ethylene glycol by P . putida TA7
To adapt P. putida TA7 for co-utilization of ethylene gly-
col, two duplicate cultures of 20  mL M9 pH 8.0, 5  mM 
TA, 25  mM EG in 125  mL flasks were inoculated with 
strain TA7 and cultured at 30  °C and 250  rpm. Once 
bacterial growth was observed (typically after 24–48  h) 
cultures were passaged to a fresh flask (to OD600 0.01). 
After 11 days (9 passages), significantly improved bacte -
rial growth was observed and cultures were streaked out 
on LB-agar plates to obtain single colonies. Four single 
clones from each culture (8 total) were tested in compari-
son to P. putida TA7 for growth in M9 minimal medium 
with varying concentrations of TA and EG; the best-per -
forming strain was designated as P. putida TA7-EG and 
analyzed by whole-genome sequencing.
ALE for co‑utilization of 1,4‑butanediol by P . putida TA7
To adapt P. putida TA7 for co-utilization of 1,4-butan -
ediol, two cultures of 20  mL M9 pH 8.0 with either 
5  mM TA and 25  mM BD, or 5  mM TA, 25  mM BD, 
and 25  mM AA, in 125  mL flasks were inoculated with 
strain TA7 and cultured at 30  °C and 250  rpm. Once 
bacterial growth was observed (typically after 24–48  h) 
cultures were passaged to fresh flasks (to OD600 0.01). 
After 11 days (7 passages), significantly improved bacte -
rial growth was observed and cultures were streaked out 
on LB-agar plates to obtain single colonies. Four single 
clones from each culture (8 total) were tested in compari-
son to P. putida TA7 for growth in M9 minimal medium 
with varying concentrations of TA, BD, and AA; the best-
performing strain was designated as P. putida TA7-BD 
and analyzed by whole-genome sequencing.
Genomic integration of  PIbpA‑PET hydrolase cassettes
The pBAMD-derived  PIbpA-PET hydrolase knock-in 
plasmids (pBAMD-P IbpA-bglx-HiC, pBAMD-P IbpA-lasb-
IsPDura, pBAMD-P IbpA-EhaA-LCC) were delivered to P. 
putida by electroporation and cells were recovered in LB 
medium at 25 °C, 250 rpm, o/n. Next, serial dilutions of 
the cell suspension were plated on LB-Kan agar plates 
and incubated at 25  °C for ca. 36  h. For each knock-in, 
sixteen single colonies were transferred using sterile 
toothpicks into deep 96-well plates supplemented with 
250 μL LB-Kan per well and incubated at 25 °C, 250 rpm, 
o/n; control wells with the parent strain were also 
included. Next, 50 μL of the cell suspension were used to 
inoculate a fresh deep 96-well plate supplemented with 
500  μL LB-Kan per well and the plate was incubated at 
25 °C, 250 rpm, for 3 h; the pre-culture plate was sealed 
and stored at 4  °C. The expression plate was then sub -
jected to a heat shock (37 °C, 250 rpm) for 2 h, followed 
by an outgrowth phase at 30 °C, 250 rpm, o/n. We then 
assessed esterase activity in the cleared supernatant and 
cell fraction of each well using the pNBP assay. The best-
performing strains were re-tested in shake flask cultures, 
followed by preparation of glycerol stocks and whole-
genome sequencing.
pNPB assay for esterase activity measurements
All pNPB esterase assays were carried out in Tris buffer 
(100 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.0, 50 mM NaCl). A calibration 
curve was prepared by measuring A405 of serial dilutions 
of 4-nitrophenol (4NP; Sigma-Aldrich) in assay buffer (95 
μL Tris buffer, 5 μL DMSO, in clear flat-bottom 96-well 
plates, in a Biotek Synergy plate reader; Additional file  1: 
Fig. S10). For measuring PET hydrolase esterase activ -
ity, 1  mL PET hydrolase expression cultures were pel -
leted in 1.5 mL tubes (500g, 2 min). 5 μL (in duplicates) 
of the cleared supernatant (or further dilutions thereof 
if esterase activity was high) were directly added to clear 
flat-bottom 96-well plates. The remaining supernatant 
was discarded and the cell pellet carefully resuspended 
in 1 mL Tris buffer, followed by a second centrifugation. 
The supernatant was discarded and the pellet carefully 
resuspended in 1 mL Tris buffer, and 5 μL (in duplicates) 
added to clear flat-bottom 96-well plates. We then pre -
pared a mastermix of Tris buffer with pNPB substrate 
(per well: 90 μL Tris buffer with 5 μL pNPB stock solu -
tion (10 mM in DMSO)); multiples of this mix were pre -
pared according to the number of wells to be analyzed 
(and including a pipetting reserve), and 95 μL were added 
to the 96-well sample plate with a multichannel pipette 
to start the reaction (final concentrations: 0.5 mM pNPB 
and 5% DMSO). Each plate contained blank wells (5 μL 
clean culture medium or Tris buffer instead of culture 
supernatant or cell suspension). The plate was imme -
diately inserted into the plate reader, and A405 of each 
well was measured in 31 s intervals (the shortest possible 
measurement interval of the plate reader). The resulting 
data were plotted as A405 over time (in s) and the data 
points showing a linear increase were included to derive 
the slope by linear regression (plotting and analysis were 
performed in GraphPad Prism 9); the slope derived 
from blank controls was subtracted. The resulting slope 
(A405/s) was then used together with the slope of the 
calibration curve (A405/μMol 4NP) to derive μMol 4NP/
min = ((A405/s)/(A405/[4NP]))×60. The resulting value 
was multiplied by 200 (as we typically used 5  μL sam -
ple per reaction) to obtain μMol 4NP/min×mL. As the 
Page 26 of 31Brandenberg et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2022) 21:119 
amount of enzyme required to release1 μMol 4NP/min is 
defined as one Unit (U), this term represents U/mL.
PET hydrolase expression cultures
To test PET hydrolase expression, single colonies of P. 
putida strains (either transformed with PET hydrolase 
expression plasmids or strains with genomic integration 
of PET hydrolase expression cassettes) were inoculated 
into 3 mL medium (LB or M9 minimal medium, the lat -
ter supplemented with TA, EG or BD) and cultured at 
250 rpm, o/n, 30 °C (all  PrhaB constructs) or 25 °C (all  PL 
and  PIbpA constructs). The next day, expression cultures 
in either 125  mL shake flasks or 14  mL tubes and con -
taining either LB or M9 medium were inoculated with 
the pre-cultures to OD600 0.1 and incubated for an addi -
tional 2–3  h under the same conditions detailed above, 
typically to an OD600 of 0.2 to 0.5 (cultures in M9 mini -
mal medium supplemented with TA, EG, or BD reached 
lower final OD600 than cultures in LB medium and were 
thus also induced at lower OD600). Induction of expres -
sion was performed through addition of 2 mM rhamnose 
(all  PrhaB constructs) or transferring the cultures to 30 °C 
or 37 °C (all  PIbpA constructs); if  PIbpA cultures were sub -
jected to a 37  °C heat shock, they were typically trans -
ferred back to 30 °C at defined time points (see figures for 
details). At selected time points post-induction, culture 
samples were taken to analyze OD600 and pNPB esterase 
activity in the culture supernatant and the cell fraction.
SP library screen
P. putida TA7-EG was transformed with the LCC, HiC, 
and IsP SP plasmid libraries and plated on LB-Kan plates, 
30  °C, o/n; cells transformed with pLo-P rhaB (e.v.) were 
included as control. For each library, pre-cultures in deep 
96-well plate with 500 μL LB-Kan per well were prepared 
and inoculated with single colonies using toothpicks; 4 
wells with e.v. control colonies were included per plate. 
The plates were sealed with Breathe-Easy membranes 
and incubated at 30  °C, 250  rpm, o/n. Next, expression 
culture deep 96-well plates with 500  μL LB-Kan were 
prepared and inoculated with 25 μL of the pre-cultures; 
the pre-culture plates were sealed and stored at 4  °C. 
The expression plates were incubated at 30 °C, 250 rpm, 
for 2  h and induced by addition of 2  mM rhamnose 
(final concentration), followed by continued incubation 
at 30  °C, 250  rpm. 3  h and 20  h post-induction, 100  μL 
cell culture per well were removed and analyzed for 
cleared supernatant esterase activity (using an end point 
assay, not the kinetic measurement) and OD600. Ester -
ase activity was plotted against OD600 and those clones 
showing the best combination of the two measurements 
were manually selected for further analysis. For selected 
clones, the corresponding wells from the pre-culture 
plates were streaked out on LB-Kan agar plates to obtain 
single colonies, and for each clone a single colony was 
used for plasmid DNA miniprep and sequencing to iden -
tify the SP . Those SPs showing up multiple times across 
the set of sequenced clones were tested in shake flask 
expression cultures and plasmid glycerol stocks in E. coli 
NEB 5-alpha were prepared.
Plastic degradation and synthetic PETtrophy assay setups
Plastic degradation assays were typically carried out in 
125 mL flasks (closed with aluminum foil) or 6-well cul -
ture plates (closed with plastic lids). To transfer sterile 
plastic film samples into these vessels, the plastic film 
was sequentially washed in beakers containing 1% SDS 
in  ddH2O,  ddH2O, and 70% EtOH. From the EtOH bath, 
the samples were directly placed with forceps into sterile 
flasks or plates, the vessel was closed again, and allowed 
to dry at 30  °C o/n to ensure evaporation of remaining 
EtOH. For powdery or ground plastic samples, the wash -
ing steps were carried out in sterile 1.7  mL tubes with 
centrifugation to pellet particles in between washing 
steps, and the sample was finally taken up in 1 mL 70% 
EtOH (using 1  mL pipette tips with cut-off tips, when 
necessary) and transferred to the culture vessel. Sin -
gle colonies of P. putida strains with genomically inte -
grated  PIbpA-PET hydrolase expression cassettes (and 
the matching control strains) were inoculated into 3 mL 
LB medium or M9 minimal medium supplemented with 
plastic monomers as carbon sources; generally, the pre-
culture medium was matched to the medium used for 
later plastic degradation assays, to ensure full activity 
of the necessary metabolic pathways. Pre-cultures were 
incubated at 25  °C, 250  rpm, o/n. The next day, fresh 
3  mL cultures were inoculated with the pre-cultures to 
OD600 0.1 and grown for 25 °C, 250 rpm, 2 h, followed 
by a heat shock at 37 °C for 2 h and 250 rpm. Next, the 
degradation cultures were started by addition of medium 
to the plastic-containing vessels (15 mL per 125 mL flask, 
or 2 mL per well for 6-well plates) and cultures were inoc-
ulated with 1 or 0.1 mL of the post-heat shock cultures, 
respectively. For synthetic PETtrophy cultures (in M9 
minimal medium without carbon source), this procedure 
introduced a small amount of carbon source-containing 
medium, and we experimented with washing the cells in 
M9 minimal medium prior to culture inoculation. How -
ever, especially for secreted constructs, this also implies 
loss of any already expressed PET hydrolases; in any case 
we did not observe consistent synthetic PETtrophy for 
neither of the two inoculation approaches. Cultures were 
maintained at 30  °C, 75  rpm (125  mL flasks) or static 
(6-well plates), with a 2  h heat shock at 37  °C per day. 
The culture medium was changed every 1 to 7  days by 
removing 80% of the remaining medium and resupplying

Brandenberg et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2022) 21:119 
 
it to a volume of 15 or 2 mL, respectively. Cultures were 
inspected daily visually, by stereo and optical microscopy, 
and by measuring OD600. Following culture termination, 
plastic samples were collected, washed using the same 
washing procedure as before, and weighed.
Whole‑genome sequencing of P . putida strains
Genomic DNA was extracted from one OD600 unit of P. 
putida cells in exponential growth phase using the Qia -
gen DNeasy kit according to the manufacturer’s instruc -
tions. Quality of genomic DNA was checked on a 0.8% 
agarose gel and samples were processed for sequencing 
using an Illumina DNA Prep kit (Illumina #20018704) 
according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, 
genomic DNA was diluted to approximately 10 ng/μL in 
 H2Oup, 30 μL (300 ng) were subjected to the Nextera tag-
mentation reaction, and tagmented DNA was cleaned up 
using magnetic beads. Next, we ran a 5-cycle PCR to add 
unique dual indexes (IDT for Illumina DNA/RNA UD 
Indexes, Integrated DNA Technologies). The resulting 
PCR products were cleaned up and size-selected using 
magnetic beads. Equal volumes were then pooled, fol -
lowed by adjustment of the concentration to 4 nM using 
resuspension buffer (RSB), assuming a fragment length 
of 600 bp. Subsequently, 5 μL library were denatured by 
adding 5  μL 0.2  M NaOH and incubating for 5  min at 
room temperature. The denatured library (10  µL) was 
then combined with 1323 μL hybridization buffer (HT1) 
to yield a 15  pM library. 600  μL of this diluted library 
were loaded on a MiSeq v2 reagent cartridge for 300 
cycles and paired-end sequencing (2 × 150-bp reads) was 
performed on an Illumina MiSeq instrument using a v3 
flow cell.
The reference genome sequence for Pseudomonas 
putida KT2440 and annotations were downloaded 
from the Pseudomonas Genome DB (http:// www. pseud 
omonas. com/ strain/ show/ 110, accessed on Septem -
ber 19, 2019) [88]. Chromosome names were adjusted 
to match across files and sequences of the knock-in 
cassettes were added to the sequence file. Paired-end 
sequencing reads were then aligned against the reference 
genome using Snippy (version 4.6.0, https:// github. com/ 
tseem ann/ snippy). Snippy output files (snps.csv) were 
further processed with custom R code in RStudio (R ver -
sion 4.0.3, RStudio version 1.3). To determine cassette 
integration sites and look for potential mutations in the 
knock-in cassettes, the aligned reads were visualized with 
the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) [89].
SDS‑PAGE of soluble and membrane fractions of PET 
hydrolase expression cultures
Isolation of the P. putida outer membrane fraction was 
adapted from established protocols [90, 91]. 20 OD600 
units of PET hydrolase membrane display expression cul-
tures (harvested 3 h post-induction for  PrhaB constructs, 
or 20 h post-induction for  PIbpA constructs) were pelleted 
(3000g, 3 min) in 15 mL tubes and stored at − 20 °C. The 
pellets were thawed on ice and resuspended in 3 mL PBS 
(Gibco) supplemented with 0.5  mg/mL lysozyme and 
2  mM EDTA. The cell suspension was sonicated on ice 
using a Fisher Scientific Sonic Dismembrator 550 with a 
microtip (settings: level 3, 1 min total, 5 s on/off cycles). 
2 mL of sample were transferred to a 2 mL tube and cen -
trifuged (21,000g, 2 min, 4 °C) to remove intact cells and 
large debris. 1.8 mL of supernatant were transferred to a 
fresh 2 mL tube and centrifuged (21,000g, 40 min, 4 °C). 
The supernatant was carefully removed (and set aside 
as cytosolic fraction) and the pellet was resuspended in 
1 mL PBS, 2% Triton X-100. The sample was incubated at 
37 °C for 30 min and centrifuged (21,000g, 30 min, 4 °C). 
The supernatant was carefully removed and the pellet 
resuspended in 45 μL PBS and 20 μL 4 × Laemmli sample 
buffer (Biorad) supplemented with 2-mercaptoethanol. 
Likewise, 15 μL of cytosolic fraction samples were mixed 
with 5 μL 4 × Laemmli sample buffer. The samples were 
heated at 95 °C for 5 min and 5 to 15 μL were loaded on 
mini-Protean TGX precast 12% gels (Biorad). The gels 
were run using mini-Protean Tetra cells and Tris/Gly -
cine/SDS buffer (Biorad) according to the manufacturer’s 
instructions. Gels were stained with Coomassie Brilliant 
Blue R-250 (1 g/L; Biorad) in 40% methanol, 10% acetic 
acid, in  ddH2O; the same solution without Coomassie 
was used for gel destaining.
SDS‑PAGE of secreted PET hydrolase expression constructs
50  mL of PET hydrolase secretion expression cultures 
(harvested 3  h post-induction for  PrhaB constructs, or 
20  h post-induction for  PIbpA constructs) were collected 
in 50  mL tubes and centrifuged (4000g, 10  min, 4  °C). 
The supernatant was carefully transferred to a fresh tube 
without disturbing the pellet and concentrated (3000g, 
4  °C, 15  min centrifugation steps with intermittent car -
ful mixing) in Amicon Ultra-15 spin concentrators (Mil -
lipore) with 10  kDa molecular weight cut-off to a final 
volume of ca. 500  μL. 15  μL of this concentrate were 
mixed with 5 μL of 4 × Laemmli sample buffer and ana -
lyzed by SDS-PAGE as described above.
LC–MS analysis of SDS‑PAGE bands
Protein bands of interest were excised from the gel and 
further processed as described by Shevchenko and col -
leagues with minor modifications [92]. Briefly, gel pieces 
were destained, followed by in-gel protein reduction, 
alkylation, and digestion using MS-grade trypsin (Pierce 
Page 28 of 31Brandenberg et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2022) 21:119 
/ Thermo Scientific, #90057). After extraction, peptides 
were desalted using C18 tips (Pierce / Thermo Scientific 
#87784), dried under vacuum and reconstituted in 5% 
formic acid (v/v). For liquid chromatography-coupled 
tandem mass spectrometric (LC–MS/MS) analysis, 
desalted peptides were fractionated online by nano-flow 
reversed phase liquid chromatography coupled to an 
Orbitrap Fusion Lumos Tribrid mass spectrometer 
(Thermo Fisher Scientific). Data was acquired in Data-
Dependent Acquisition mode.
Peptide identification and quantification was per -
formed with MaxQuant version 1.6.17.0 [93]. The search 
was performed against a P. putida KT2440 protein data -
base downloaded from UniProt (https:// www. unipr  ot. 
org/ prote omes/ UP000 000556, accessed on January 20, 
2022). To this database, which contained 5527 proteins, 
the sequences for the three PET hydrolases and the mem-
brane anchor EhaA were added. Only fully LysC- and 
trypsin-digested peptides with up to one missed cleavage 
were allowed. Carbamidomethylation of cysteines was 
defined as a fixed modification. Peptide-spectrum-match 
(PSM) and protein-level false discovery rates (FDRs) were 
set to 0.01. The MaxQuant output (evidence.txt) was then 
filtered for peptides belonging to the PET hydrolases and 
with an intensity of > 1e9.
SEM of plastic samples
SEM images were taken by the Molecular Instrumenta -
tion Center at UCLA’s Department of Chemistry and 
Biochemistry. Briefly, plastic samples were sequentially 
washed with 70% EtOH, 1% SDS in  ddH2O, and  ddH2O, 
and air dried. The samples were coated with an 8 nm gold 
layer, and images were acquired using a JEOL JSM-6700F 
FE-SEM using the LEI detector.
