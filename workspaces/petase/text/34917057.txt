The widespread use of commercial polymers composed of a mixture of polylactic acid 
and polyethene terephthalate (PLA-PET) in bottles and other packaging materials has 
caused a massive environmental crisis. The valorization of these contaminants via cost-
effective technologies is urgently needed to achieve a circular economy. The enzymatic 
hydrolysis of PLA-PET contaminants plays a vital role in environmentally friendly strategies 
for plastic waste recycling and degradation. In this review, the potential roles of microbial 
enzymes for solving this critical problem are highlighted. Various enzymes involved in 
PLA-PET recycling and bioconversion, such as PETase and MHETase produced by 
Ideonella sakaiensis; esterases produced by Bacillus and Nocardia; lipases produced by 
Thermomyces lanuginosus, Candida antarctica, Triticum aestivum, and Burkholderia spp.; 
and leaf-branch compost cutinases are critically discussed. Strategies for the utilization 
of PLA-PET’s carbon content as C1 building blocks were investigated for the production 
of new plastic monomers and different value-added products, such as cyclic acetals, 
1,3-propanediol, and vanillin. The bioconversion of PET-PLA degradation monomers to 
polyhydroxyalkanoate biopolymers by Pseudomonas  and Halomonas  strains was 
addressed in detail. Different solutions to the production of biodegradable plastics from 
food waste, agricultural residues, and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB)-accumulating bacteria 
were discussed. Fuel oil production via PLA-PET thermal pyrolysis and possible hybrid 
integration techniques for the incorporation of thermostable plastic degradation enzymes 
for the conversion into fuel oil is explained in detail.

INTRODUCTION: PLASTIC WASTE, AN 
ENORMOUS ECOLOGICAL EMERGENCY
Global plastic production, including additives and fillers, has 
increased dramatically since the 1950s. Between 1950 and 2019, 
8,100 Mt. of plastic was produced worldwide. Plastic production 
grew from 2 Mt. in 1950 to 450 Mt. in 2019 ( Shanmugam 
et al., 2020 ). Currently, only 4 Mt. of biobased or biodegradable 
plastics are produced globally. They are used in almost every 
industry and household for disposable items such as wraps, 
plates, cups, and spoons ( Song et  al., 2009 ). Synthetic plastics 
are traditionally made from refined petroleum products in a 
controlled environment. These heavy crude oil-based plastics 
have the potential to contribute to the loss of resources, climate 
change, and greenhouse gas emissions ( Brandt, 2011). However, 
the microbial degradation of plastic is determined by chemical 
bonding, rather than the source monomers ( Blanco et  al., 
2020). As common plastics are composed of multiple repeats 
of small monomer units, they have a high molecular weight. 
Biological resources can be  used to obtain polymers, including 
polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), 
and polyethene terephthalate (PET), which all start with similar 
monomers. These plastics are not biodegradable, despite including 
biobased components ( Alshehrei, 2017 ). For example, plastic 
materials are made of high molecular weight polymers and 
additives. They are indispensable in many applications owing 
to their versatility; they are used in the packaging, construction, 
automotive, electronic, agriculture, home, leisure, and sports 
industries, among others ( Zhang et  al., 2018 ; 
PlasticsEurope, 2019 ).
The demand for readily available plastic items continues to 
grow as the world’s population grows and lifestyles change. 
Thus, synthetic plastic manufacturing dominates global industries. 
Globally, 350–400 million tons of plastic waste is generated 
each year ( Roser, 2018), with this value predicted to be  3-fold 
higher by 2050 ( Macarthur et al., 2016 ). As present, the largest 
global waste challenges are food waste and plastic waste ( Su 
et al., 2020a; Nanda and Berruti, 2021). Contamination resulting 
from plastic use is a global problem that occurs in all land 
areas and oceans, with an estimated 580,000 pieces of plastic 
per square kilometer ( Wilcox et  al., 2015 ). A more recent 
United Nations-commissioned study discovered that over 600 
species of organisms, ranging from bacteria to whales, have 
been damaged by marine plastic waste; most of those organisms 
became ill after ingesting the plastic ( Bhuyan et  al., 2021 ). 
The most common food packaging products are high-density 
polyethylene (HDPE) flexible plastic packaging, polystyrene 
(PS) styrofoam boxes, PP rigid plastic containers, and PET 
soft drink bottles ( Lim et  al., 2018 ). The difference between 
the plastic waste produced globally and recycled waste is 
presented in Table  1. Various solutions have been proposed 
to deal with plastic waste, including waste sorting, value-added 
recycling, energy recovery, product bans, and biodegradable 
plastic production ( Su et  al., 2020b ). The separation of various 
types of plastic waste from food waste is impossible, and this 
is likely to persist for an extended time ( Gala et  al., 2020 ). 
Organic residues in plastic-contaminated food waste can 
contaminate the soil, water, and air with pathogens, greenhouse 
gases, and unpleasant aromas ( Zhang et  al., 2021 ). Plastic and 
food waste can act as a catalyst for the dispersion of disease-
causing microbes, such as viruses ( Zhang et  al., 2020 ). The 
costs and time requirements associated with cultivating, 
maintaining, and extracting enzymes from microorganisms are 
somewhat high. The process of enzymatic microbial degradation 
usually comprises the breaking of polymer bonds to produce 
smaller monomer components that can be  processed further 
(Koshti et al., 2018 ). Petroleum-based polymers degrade slowly 
and research into their biodegradation is in its infancy, despite 
recent studies examining the biodegradation of plastic waste 
using specialized microbial strains (Baskaran and Rajamanickam, 
2019; Gunawan et  al., 2020; Li et  al., 2020 ). A critical research 
gap is the lack of well-characterized microbes capable of digesting 
plastic that can be  employed as model organisms for further 
investigations. Consequently, scientists should focus their efforts 
on the discovery of plastic-degrading bacteria to provide further 
groundwork with respect to the rapid biodegradation of polymers 
(Sánchez, 2020; Carmen, 2021 ; Matjašič et  al., 2021). The total 
plastic waste and recycling development over the last decade 
are presented in Table  1.
According to “Plastics – the Facts ( PlasticsEurope, 2016 ), ” 
which examined data from 2006 to 2014, there has been a 
slight growth in waste generation and notable increase in 
recycling. However, the percentage difference between waste 
generation and recycling is still very large. This difference can 
be  reduced by replacing plastic with biodegradable plastic and 
using biotechnology to enhance plastic biodegradation, which 
will reduce pollution and contribute to a healthy environment 
(PlasticsEurope, 2016 ). Only approximately 9% of all plastic 
is recycled after use, which is a major cause of global plastic 
pollution ( Hopewell et  al., 2009 ).
This review focuses on microbial hydrolase enzymes that 
have been shown to digest PET-polylactic acid (PLA) under 
anaerobic or aerobic conditions. PET and PLA are abundant 
and incredibly valuable materials that have a wide range of 
applications. Therefore, the development of technologies to 
valorize PET-PLA waste is needed to prevent plastic pollution 
and achieve a circular economy. Herein, we  have discussed 
plastic biodegradation by I. sakaiensis , Bacillus, Thermomyces

lanuginosus, Candida antarctica , Triticum aestivum , and 
Burkholderia spp., and Leaf-branch compost cutinases  (LCC) 
for PET-PLA generated monomers that are directly upcycled 
into small molecules with added value, including cyclic acetals, 
1,3-propanediol, and vanillin. Pseudomonas stutzeri, Pseudomonas 
aeruginosa, Streptomyces setonii, Streptomyces badius, Rhodococcus 
ruber, Comamonas acidovorans , Butyrivibrio fibrisolvens , and 
Clostridium thermocellum are the main bacterial species among 
the vast microbial populations linked to polymer degradation. 
Similarly, fungal species, including Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus 
niger, Fusarium lini, Mucor rouxii, and Pycnoporus cinnabarinus, 
are discussed. We  have also focused on fuel oil production 
using various methods, such as PLA-PET thermal pyrolysis/
microwave-heated pyrolysis, self-made catalysts, fluidized-bed 
reactors, and in-house fabricated glass reactors. A possible 
hybrid integration technique to incorporate thermostable plastic 
degradation enzymes in the conversion into fuel oil will 
be  explained in detail. This section discusses how biobased 
plastics can act as an alternative to fossil-based plastics. The 
challenges of PLA-PET waste bioconversion or thermal conversion 
into value-added products and fuel oils have been 
critically investigated.
MICROBIAL ENZYMES: A POTENTIAL 
SOLUTION FOR GREEN RECYCLING
Most high molecular weight synthetic polymers can 
be  biodegraded by microorganisms. Microbes have the ability 
to break down highly crystalline polymers; however, their 
utilization in commercial plastics is restricted. Microbiomes 
commonly interact with abiotic elements, such as heat and 
light, to alter polymer structures and enzymatic attack ( Lear 
et  al., 2021 ). Plastics are biodegraded by bacteria, fungi, and 
algae found in landfill leachate, sewage sludge, and compost. 
These microorganisms can degrade both natural and synthetic 
polymers ( Sankhla et  al., 2020 ).
Microbial biomass is a waste product of biodegradation. 
The waste products are the outcome of using organic polymers 
as energy and growth substrates, as shown in Figure 1. Enzymatic 
energy harvesting by microorganisms efficiently destroys natural 
polymers. Surprisingly, bacteria have evolved also these ancient 
decomposition pathways for use to degrade artificial plastic 
polymers. For example, Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6  was shown 
to grow solely on PET. PETases and MHETases are two new 
enzymes catalyzed in nontoxic monomers by PET hydrolysis 
[for example, terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG); 
Y oshida et  al., 2016 ]. In addition to I. sakaiensis , which 
biologically produces PETase, several bacterial systems, including 
Bacillus and Escherichia, have been studied as overexpressing 
PETase enzymes ( Huang et  al., 2018 ). Cutinase, lipase, and 
esterase are the most common enzymes studied for the 
degradation of synthetic oligomers or polymers ( Danso et  al., 
2018). Multiple enzymes and metabolic pathways are frequently 
involved in the breakdown of polymers ( Taniguchi et al., 2019). 
Enzymatic hydrolysis in stirred tanks and membrane bioreactors 
are the most commonly used techniques ( Pino et  al., 2018 ). 
High solid loadings are seen as an alternative to improve the 
biodegradation processes, whereas bubble columns and gas-lift  
bioreactors are used for enzymatic hydrolysis (EH).
Bacterial Degradation of PLA-PET Waste
Microbes degrade organic matter via enzymes. Carbon, nitrogen, 
and sulfur are transferred in elementary cycles via biodegradation 
and this procedure releases CO 2, methane, and other biological 
components (Chandra and Rustgi, 1998 ). Microorganisms have 
been studied for their ability to decrease the strength of synthetic 
and natural polymers ( Rujnić-Sokele and Pilipović, 2017 ). 
Biodegradability depends on the environment, because 
microorganisms and biodiversity are diverse. Plastic 
biodegradability is affected by the characteristics of both the 
microbe and the polymer ( Tokiwa et  al., 2009 ). The diversity 
of microbes that can degrade plastic is affected by various 
circumstances, including ambient conditions, temperature, and 
pH. In terms of environmental conditions, the moisture content 
of the soil is critical for microorganism growth. The soil’s 
water content is essential for microbial activation ( Briški and 
Domanovac, 2017). The hydrolytic cleavage of microorganisms 
increases as the moisture content increases. Temperature and 
pH are essential elements in the breakdown process ( Karigar 
and Rao, 2011 ; Mohanan et  al., 2020 ). In addition to ambient 
conditions, temperature, and pH, microbial diversity also 
fluctuates. The soil moisture content is critical for microorganism 
growth ( Jin and Kirk, 2018 ; Ratzke and Gore, 2018 ).
Under certain conditions, the chemical structure of degradable 
plastics will be  changed significantly. In biodegradable plastics, 
this change is caused by the action of natural microorganisms 
(ASTM International, 2017). In principle, all organic compounds 
are biodegradable. However, to achieve this, different factors 
must be  considered. The degradation of bioplastics via 
microorganisms and their degrading enzymes has emerged as 
a method of solving the unintended waste stream generated 
by large-scale plastic production. PET-PLA is an abundant 
and valuable material with a wide range of applications 
throughout society. Unfortunately, the global economy is not 
yet ready to fully embrace the benefits of recycling plastics 
because of the lack of cost effective equipment to measure 
the quality of post-consumer PET-PLA trash. PET and other 
materials may be  recycled from PET by utilizing technologies 
such as monomer recycling, although recycling focus on 
repurposing the monomers to make additional PET.
Thermobifida fusca  KW3, a gram-positive thermophilic 
actinomycete secretes a highly hydrophobic carboxylesterase 
(TfCa) that can hydrolyze PET ( Oeser et al., 2010 ). To enhance 
TfCa enzyme expression and avoid the formation of inclusion 
bodies, its codon usage and induction conditions were optimized. 
The optimization conferred a 4,000-fold increase in TfCa activity. 
The TfCa protein concentration was found to be  41.6 mg/L 
after culture in a pH-controlled bioreactor ( Samak et al., 2020 ). 
The hydrophobic synthetic cyclic PET trimer was hydrolyzed 
by a carboxylesterase from Thermobifida fusca  KW3, a 
thermophilic actinomycetes at 60 °C and pH 6 ( Billig et  al., 
2010). The values of V max and K m for the hydrolysis were 
9.3 mmol−1 min −1 mg −1 and 0.5 mM, respectively. The esterase

demonstrated a strong preference for short- and medium-chain 
fatty acyl esters of p-nitrophenol. The enzyme retained 37% 
of its activity after culture at 50 °C and pH 8 for 96 h. The 
process used a standard three-element catalytic system that 
includes the amino acids serine, glutamic acid, and histidine.
Acero et  al. (2011)  expressed cutinases from Thermobifida 
cellulosilytica DSM44535 (Thc_Cut1 and Thc_Cut2) and 
Thermobifida fusca DSM44342 (Thf42_Cut1) in Escherichia coli 
BL21-Gold(DE3) to hydrolyze PET. Two cutinases from T. fusca 
KW3 were compared with PHA depolymerase (ePhaZmcl) from 
Pseudomonas fluorescens. pNP-acetate and pNP-butyrate exhibited 
kcat and Km values in the ranges of 2.4–211.9 s−1 and 127–200 μM 
and 5.3 and 195.1 s−1 and between 1,483 and 2,133 μM, 
respectively. The PET-based products had a high conversion 
rate to MHET and TA. The water contact angle (WCA) could 
also change as a result of the change in the hydrophilicity.
Bacillus subtilis p -nitrobenzylesterase (BsEstB) was isolated 
and confirmed to hydrolyze PET ( Ribitsch et  al., 2011 ). The 
expressed BsEstB of 55.2 kDa showed a specific activity of 77 
and 108 U/mg after reaction with p-nitrophenyl acetate (PNPA) 
and p-nitrophenyl butyrate (PNPB), respectively. BsEstB 
demonstrated strong enzyme activity at 40 °C and pH 7.0 and 
good stability for several days at pH 7.0 and 37 °C. The half-
life was 3 days at 40°C and 6 h at 45°C. The principal conversion 
products of PET films with a lower WCA were the TA and 
MHET products, which decreased from 68.2° ± 1.7° to 62.6° ± 1.1°.
Thermobifida alba  (Tha_Cut1) cutinase was overexpressed 
for PET hydrolysis ( Ribitsch et  al., 2012b ). The Cut1 sample 
demonstrated a considerable degree of active PET surface 
hydrolysis, which improved hydrophilicity, as observed by a 
decrease in the WCA from 87.7 ° to 45 °. The PNPB and PNPA 
values were 2.72 and 6.03 s−1 for Km and 213 and 1933 μM 
for the kcat, respectively. Tha_Cut1 primarily released 
2-hydroxyethyl benzoate after interaction with 
bis(benzoyloxyethyl)terephthalate (3PET). Unlike the well-studied 
Humicula insolens  cutinase (HiC), which preferably liberates 
3PET terminal benzoic acid, this takes up all the carbon, 
oxygen, and nitrogen, rendering it very toxic to the environment.
In E. coli, the enzyme Thh_Est, which shares 87% homology 
with an esterase found in T. alba, was studied for its ability 
to surface-hydrolyze PLA and PET ( Ribitsch et  al., 2011). PET 
was digested by Thh_Est, which released TA and MHET in 
similar proportions (19.8 and 21.5 mmol/mol of enzyme) without 
producing higher-order oligomers such as BHET. PLA was 
FIGURE 1 |  Schematic workflow of the biodegradation of plastic waste through enzymatic hydrolysis. The biodegradation of PLA-PET plastic waste is dependent 
on the diversity of the microorganisms and the environmental/experimental conditions. At a commercial level, this biological process occurs in bioreactors. The 
culture medium in the bioreactors results in the production of enzymes by the microbes. After excretion of the enzymes, they attach to the external surface of the 
plastic. As time passes, owing to their enzymatic activity, cracks appear on the polymer surface, subsequently causing it to decompose into lower molecular weight 
units, i.e., monomers and the other value-added products. The recycled monomers can be reused as a resin for polymer production.

hydrolyzed, and lactic acid was released. Both the enzymatic 
and surface hydrolysis processes of PET and PLA caused an 
increase in hydrophilicity; the WCA decreased from 90.8 ° and 
75.5° to 50.4 °, respectively, and the water droplets spread 
entirely over the surface.
Tcur1278 and Tcur0390 from Thermomonospora curvata  
DSM43183 were found to have 61% sequence identity with 
the enzyme from T. fusca  ( Wei et  al., 2014 ). The optimal 
reaction temperatures of Tcur1278 and Tcur0390 were 60 and 
55°C, respectively. It was found that the optimum pH of both 
enzymes was 8.5. After incubation for 60 min at 55°C, Tcur1278 
retained more than 80% of its initial activity, and Tcur0390 
had less than 10% of its initial activity. At reaction temperatures 
of up to 50 °C, Tcur0390 was exhibited more effect hydrolysis 
of poly ( ε-caprolactone) and PET nanoparticles than Tcur1278. 
At 55 and 60 °C, only Tcur1278 exerted hydrolytic activity on 
PET nanoparticles. In molecular dynamics situations, Tcur1278 
was demonstrated to have superior thermal stability, which is 
likely to be  the main reason for its greater hydrolytic activity 
against PET.
The cutinase Cut190, from Saccharomonospora viridis, was 
expressed in E. coli  ( Kawai et  al., 2014 ). The substitutions of 
Ser226 to Pro and Arg228 to Ser were shown to increase 
activity when operating at 65–75 °C and pH 6.5–8.0  in the 
presence of 20% glycerol and Ca 2+ ions. The mutant Cut190 
could hydrolyze various aliphatic polyester materials. Y oshida 
et  al. (2016)  discovered a unique species that used PETase 
and MHETase to hydrolyze PET, enabling it to utilize plastic 
as its only energy and carbon source. The bacterium could 
therefore easily convert PET into TPA and EG, which was 
used for growth. PET film was hydrolyzed at 60 °C using a 
dual enzyme system, including the KW3 strain of Thermobifida 
fusca TfCut2, and a metagenome-derived LC-cutinase ( Barth 
et  al., 2016). In the enzyme system, the amount of breakdown 
products formed was 2.4-fold greater when compared with 
TfCut2 after reaction for 24 h.
Cutinase from Humicola insolens  ( De Castro et  al., 2017 ) 
showed the best performance of 16 commercial lipases and 
was used for reactions with PET, solely or in combination 
with the efficient MHET-converting lipase from Candida 
antarctica. When two enzymes were used in combination, the 
concentration of the product was more than twice that when 
the enzyme was used alone, and the rate of terephthalic acid 
production was increased, reaching 9.36 g/L. Carniel et  al. 
(2017) screened 10 enzymes using BHET as the substrate and 
found that the combination of Candida antarctica  lipase B 
(CALB) and HiC resulted in complete synergetic 
depolymerization of PET to TPA and a 7.7-fold increase in 
PET to TPA yield was achieved.
Four types of cutinase from Thermobifida cellulosilytica were 
employed to hydrolyze HMLS-PET cords ( Vecchiato et  al., 
2017). -COOH of 0.51 nmol mm −2 resulted in the highest 
degree of functionalization, with 1.35 mM of soluble product 
was released after 72 h. Compared with NaOH-based chemical 
hydrolysis, EH only solubilizes 0.7% of the polymer, without 
any reduction in mechanical characteristics or crystallinity. 
PET-TE membranes with a highly crystalline structure could 
be  hydrolyzed by cutinases 1 and 2 from T. cellulosilytica and 
a fusion protein of cutinase 1 with the polymer-binding module 
from Alcaligenes faecalis (Thc Cut1 PBM) through a very narrow 
pore size distribution ( Gamerith et  al., 2017 ). By comparing 
the effects of two surface-functionalized versions of Thc_Cut1_
PBM in the EH of PET-TE film on hydrophilic and hydrophobic 
surfaces, the influence of surface chemistry was also studied. 
The initial PET-TE membrane had the highest surface hydrolysis 
efficiency, resulting in a weight loss of 0.36%, which corresponded 
to the removal of approximately 3 nm of PET from the entire 
porous membrane surface, which was well correlated with a 
4-nm increase in the measured barrier aperture. A chemo-
enzymatic treatment was developed to recover TPA and EG 
from PET ( Quartinello et  al., 2017 ). The chemical treatment, 
performed at 250 °C and 40 bar, converted PET into 85% TPA 
and other small oligomers. The hydrolysis in the second step 
using the HiC yielding 97% pure TPA, which was comparable 
with commercial synthetic grade TPA (98%). Biundo et  al. 
(2018) improved the activity of an esterase (Cbotu_EstA) from 
Clostridium botulinum  on PET by site-directed mutations in 
zinc-binding domain and deleted the domain consisting of 71 
amino acids at the N-terminus. The zinc-binding domain of 
the native enzyme had 50-fold lower activity than the combination 
with truncations and substitution. Moreover, the kinetic 
parameters of Cbotu_EstA demonstrated a noticeable shift from 
water-soluble to insoluble polymer substrates.
The protein Sub1, a potential cutinase from Streptomyces 
scabies, was expressed in E. coli , purified, and characterized 
(Jabloune et  al., 2020 ). Among the carbon short chain 
p-nitrophenyl esters, Sub1 had the strongest hydrolytic activity. 
The Vmax was 2.36 mol g −1 min −1 for p-NPB. The Sub1 esterase 
hydrolyzed PET, as shown by the release of TA. The addition 
of Triton to Sub1 on PET led to an increase in activity, and 
the Sub1 activity was found to be  stable at 37 °C for at least 
20 days. The expression of BhrPETase in Bacillus subtilis  was 
0.66 g/L, and the biochemical characteristics of BhrPETase 
showed that BhrPETase had stronger hydrolytic activity on 
amorphous PET than LCC and IsPETase, as previously reported, 
as expressed under the same conditions ( Xi et  al., 2021 ). The 
purified BhrPETase has a melting temperature of up to 101 °C, 
making it the most heat-resistant bacterial PETase 
ever characterized.
Polylactic acid depolymerase from Paenibacillus amylolyticus 
showed degradation activities against PLA ( Akutsu-Shigeno 
et al., 2003 ). Lactic acid was found to be a degradation product 
of PLA. The gene encoded 201 amino acid residues, including 
the conserved pentapeptide Ala-His-Ser-Met-Gly, which is 
present in the lipases of mesophilic Bacillus species. Kawai 
et  al. (2014)  ( Kawai, 2010 ) reported that microorganisms and 
PLA depolymerases are capable of decomposing PLA. The 
finding offsets the fact that PLA is highly vitrifiable and that 
microbes capable of decomposing PLA can do so at temperatures 
as low as 37 °C. In this case, members of the Nocardiaceae 
family are the putrefying microorganisms here. The Amycolatopsis 
PLA depolymerases were isolated and cloned as serine proteases. 
The thermophilic lipases used to make the PLA were derived 
from Bacillus thermophilus  strains that could grow at 60 °C.

Enzymes such as proteases and lipases are widely used in 
industrial settings as PLA depolymerases. Protease-type 
depolymerases were enantioselective for L-PLA, but lipase-type 
depolymerases were enantioselective for D-PLA. Consequently, 
two unique types of PLA depolymerases degrade the lipases 
and proteases. The EH conditions of PLA fibers were optimized 
with lipaselipases from different sources ( Lee and Song, 2011 ).

(PaE) showed high breakdown potential for biodegradable 
polymers ( Shinozaki et  al., 2013 ). Poly (butylene succinate-co-
adipate) activity against phthalate esters (PaE) was 54.8 ± 6.3 U/
mg. Moreover, it was found that PaE could also degrade PBS, 
PBSA, and PLA solid films.
Tchigvintsev et  al. (2015)  performed a search for novel 
carboxylesterases inside three marine metagenomic gene banks. 
They found 23 active clones, five of which were extremely 
active esters and, at 5 °C, exhibited an ability to target both 
α-naphthalene and p-nitrophenyl esters. MGS0010 exhibited a 
2-fold increase in activity in the presence of 3.5 M NaCl or 
KCl; however, the other four esterases were inhibited to various 
degrees. Esterases may also hydrolyze PLA polyester substrates, 
suggesting that they may be suitable for depolymerizing polyester. 
To enhance the amount of hydroxyl and carboxylic groups on 
the polymer chains, H. insolens  cutinase ( Pellis et  al., 2015 ) 
was employed to hydrolyze PLA film. Another change in WCA 
was found, as it decreased from 74.6 to 33.1 °, and roughness 
and waviness were 10 times higher than in than the 
control samples.
The structures of two native cutinases from Thermobifida 
cellulosilytica, named Thc_Cut1 and Thc_Cut2, as well as of 
two variants were investigated by Ribitsch et  al. (2017) . They 
showed different activities toward PLA. Although, the crystal 
structure analysis did not reveal significant conformational 
differences, unique SAXS scattering data collected from enzymes 
in the solution showed significant surface charge differences 
among the different cutinases. The differences in surface 
electrostatic potential and hydrophobicity could explain the 
different binding patterns of the four cutinases on PLA, and 
thus explain their different activities. Est119 from Thermobifida 
alba AHK119 can degrade polymer substrates, including PLA. 
The PLA-degrading mechanism by Est119 was clarified by 
Kitadokoro et al. (2019), who found that the amino acid residues 
responsible for substrate interaction were substantially conserved 
in the enzymes of Ideonella sakaiensis, including cutinases and 
PETase. The bacterial enzymes in literature for the biodegradation 
are briefly mentioned in Table  2.
Fungal Degradation of PLA-PET Waste
The fungal kingdom comprises an exceedingly diverse and 
fascinating eukaryotic collection of aerobic microorganisms 
varying from simple yeast cells to highly mycelial molds 
(Rossman, 1995). Single-celled or pseudomycelia growth is the 
standard for yeasts, although molds usually grow as mycelia. 
Because fungi, like bacteria, decompose and mix with organic 
substances, they are vital to the breakdown of the C–C bonds 
in the biosphere. Different species of bacteria and fungi can 
indeed grow in conditions with less moisture and in solutions 
with a lower pH, which helps organic materials decompose 
(Spellman, 2007 ). Fungi are incredibly active in decomposing 
natural polymeric materials owing to their extracellular 
multienzyme complexes. They are also capable of rapidly 
colonizing and penetrating substrates via their hyphal systems 
and transporting and redistributing nutrients within their 
mycelium via their hyphal systems ( Matavulj and Molitoris, 
2009). A diverse range of fungal strains from various classes, 
ecologies, and morphologies has been demonstrated to 
destroy plastics.
Fungi are highly capable of degrading many materials, 
including lignin, and are used in remediating contaminants 
(Fritsche and Hofrichter, 2005 ), as indicated in Table  3. New 
studies have indicated that the Aspergillus genus  is the most 
prevalent of all the fungal groups appropriate for the 
biodegradation of synthetic plastics. Aspergillus clavatus , 
Aspergillus fumigatus, and Aspergillus niger  are three different 
species of Aspergillus that have been found in terrestrial habitats 
around the world and are known to degrade PE, PU, and PP 
(Abraham et  al., 2016 ). Neosartorya, Amorphoteca, and 
Talaromyces were deserted from soil polluted with petroleum 
and demonstrated to be  promising hydrocarbon degradation 
organisms (Chaillan et al., 2004 ). In addition, it was discovered 
that the collectively, a number of individuals of fungi, namely 
Penicillium, Cephalosporium, and Aspergillus, are capable 
degraders of crude oil hydrocarbons ( Singh, 2006 ). Alternaria 
solani, Fusarium solani , Spicaria spp., Geomyces pannorum , 
Phoma sp., and Penicillium spp. are additional fungal species 
with a high degree of plastic degradability ( Sowmya et  al., 
2015). Contrary to popular belief, different fungal consortia 
have been proven to destroy various polymers, such as PET 
and PLA, through synergistic action ( Ghosh et  al., 2019 ; 
Nikolaivits et  al., 2021 ). Before eventual depolymerization, as 
well as their potential to release hydrophobin for improved 
hyphal adhesion to hydrophobic substrates, fungal hyphae are 
critical in both the initial colonization and the subsequent 
depolymerization of the fungus ( Wang et  al., 2018 ; Quarantin 
et  al., 2019 ). Pretreatment factors such as exposure to light 
and temperature and acid pretreatment and various additives 
have been used to enhance fungal biodegradation of plastics 
(Montazer et al., 2020 ). The hydrolysis of PLA fibers by lipases 
was greatest at 40 °C for 60 min at pH 7.5 for A. niger  lipase, 
40°C for 120 min at pH 8.0 for Candida cylindracea  lipase, 
and 45 °C for 120 min at pH 8.0 for Candida rugosa  lipase. 
Lipase from Aspergillus niger MTCC 2594 was 53.8-fold purified 
by hydrophobic chromatography after interaction with octyl 
sepharose, and the enzyme revealed two protein bands with 
apparent molecular masses of 35 and 37 kDa (Nakajima-Kambe 
et  al., 2012 ). The lipase had maximum activity at pH 7.0 and 
37°C, and was stable between pH 4.0 and 10.0, as well as 
temperatures up to 50 °C. Olive oil, as a substrate, yielded 
values of K m and V max of 3.83 mM and 32.21 μmol/min/mg, 
respectively. The lipase has the potential to degrade PLA and 
poly(ε-caprolactone). A Fusarium oxysporum cutinase, FoCut5a, 
was expressed in E. coli  BL21 ( Dimarogona et  al., 2015 ). The 
highest production of recombinant FoCut5a was achieved using 
periplasmic expression at 16 °C. The X-ray structure was

determined at 1.9 Å resolution. The crystal structure was highly 
similar to that of Fusarium solani  cutinase. FoCut5a showed 
absolute activity at 40 °C and pH 8.0, while it was active on 
three p-nitrophenyl synthetic esters of aliphatic acids, with the 
maximum catalytic efficiency for the hydrolysis of butyl ester. 
FoCut5a cutinase is capable of modifying the surface of PET 
fabrics. The optimal parameters were found to be  40 °C, pH 
8, and 1.92 mg of enzyme loading per gram of fabric

(Kanelli et  al., 2015 ). The analysis of tensile test and dyeability 
proved that the surface treatment did not harm the quality 
of the original material. The S-2 strain of Cryptococcus sp. 
had remote similarity to cutinases, but not lipases ( Masaki 
et  al., 2005 ). This enzyme can degrade PLA and other 
biodegradable plastics such as poly(butylene succinate) and 
poly(3-hydroxybutyrate).
Algae as a Promising Candidate for Plastic 
Degradation
Microalgae are unicellular photosynthetic organisms capable 
of converting water and CO 2 into nutrients such as proteins, 
amino acids, lipids, polysaccharides, and carotenoids. They 
are a good candidate for a “microbial factory” because they 
can use readily accessible materials, such as inorganic nutrients 
(CO2), water, sunlight, and wastewater, with little or no 
effort. The identification of algae and their toxins that can 
biologically degrade polymeric materials can help reduce 
white pollution ( Bhuyar et al., 2019 ). In contrast, bioplastics 
made from algae offer the same qualities as petroleum-based 
polymers while being naturally biodegradable ( Chia et  al., 
2020). They can be  grown on ponds and do not require 
specialized fertile land or freshwaters. Thus, microalgal biomass 
is an ideal low-cost bioprocess system for the production 
of PHA ( Arora et  al., 2021 ). Among them, only a few 
eukaryotic algae, such as Chlorella, have been reported to 
produce PHA ( Roja et  al., 2019 ). Cyanobacteria are some 
of the oldest and first photoautotrophic microorganisms on 
earth. They contribute to the global carbon/oxygen cycle 
and helped to evolve life by creating an oxygen-rich 
environment. The phycocyanin pigment confers their 
characteristic blue-green color, hence the name blue-green 
algae ( Kaewbai-Ngam et al., 2016 ). The growth of microalgae 
in a closed laboratory photobioreactor, wastewater, or open 
ponds can yield higher biomass. This biomass can be harvested 
and processed for use as a substrate by other heterotrophic 
bacteria and produce PHA ( Rahman et al., 2014 ). Microalgae 
cultures can use inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus for 
growth, making them a perfect solution for tertiary and 
quaternary treatments. Moreover, their ability to remove 
heavy metals and some toxic organic compounds prevents 
the secondary pollution ( Abdel-Raouf et al., 2012 ). Microalgae, 
like bacteria, are a biological pollutant owing to their 
endotoxins and carbon demand ( Y an et al., 2016). Microalgae 
grow in natural and laboratory environments with bacteria 
in mutually beneficial relationships. Bacteria benefit from 
the oxygen and extracellular substances of microalgae and 
return the favor with CO 2 and vitamins ( Han et  al., 2016 ). 
Organic pollution can harm water quality in many ways. 
Algal wastewater treatment systems are now widely accepted 
as an effective conventional treatment system. Algal wastewater 
treatment systems are a significant low-cost alternative to 
complex, expensive treatment systems, particularly for

municipal wastewater purification ( Sen et  al., 2013 ). 
Phaeodactylum tricornutum, a photosynthetic chassis, produces 
a microbial cell factory that develops an engineered form 
of PETase, which is secreted into the surrounding culture 
medium to degrade PET in aquatic environments ( Moog 
et al., 2019 ). To better predict how climate change will affect 
aquatic microbial ecosystems, we  need to understand 
community resilience. Interlevel interactions in a mixed 
community of microalgae and bacteria have a large impact 
on system resilience ( Sörenson et  al., 2021 ). The potential 
of the microalgal species Chlorella vulgaris  with pretreatment, 
marked by its effectiveness in cracking and changing polymers, 
aids the growth of microorganisms on fractured surfaces 
(Falah et  al., 2020 ). They found that the microbial species 
could produce the biodegradation products found in PET, 
such as alkane esters, fatty acids, benzoic acid, and aromatics, 
and the most toxic biodegradation product is bis(2-ethyl 
hexyl phthalate). In total, 10 algal species belonging to nine 
families, seven orders, and 10 genera were identified from 
various polyethylene-degrading locations ( Sharma et al., 2014 ). 
Microalgae produce enzymes that reduce reaction activation 
energy and weaken polymer chemical bonds, promoting 
biodegradation. Microalgae have the ability to convert plastics 
into metabolites such as CO 2, H 2O, and new cell biomass 
(i.e., mineralization).
Biomass gasification converts biomass into CH 4, H, CO 2, 
and NH 3. The gas produced from this process can be  used 
as fuel gas, engine fuel, or as a feedstock for other industrial 
processes (synthetic gas; Mckendry, 2002 ). Microalgae are 
productive (12.5 kg m −2 year −1) compared with most other 
plants ( Shay, 1993 ). As reported by Goudriaan et  al. (2000) , 
a 75% thermal efficiency was achieved in a 10 kg dry weight 
h−1 pilot plant during the hydrothermal upgrading process of 
biomass. Bio-crude oil comprises approximately 45% of the 
whole feedstock weight and has a lower heat capacity of 
30–35 MJ kg −1, enabling it to work with diesel fuel and 
be  improved further.
The liquefaction of biomass by direct heating is very well 
studied. A handful of methods rely on algal biomass for their 
technology. Minowa et al. (1995) performed direct hydrothermal 
liquefaction at temperatures of 300 °C and pressures of 10 MPa 
to achieve a moisture content of 78.4 wt% and an oil yield 
of roughly 37% for Dunaliella tertiolecta. After 60 min of holding 
time at 350 °C, the oil obtained had viscosity in the range of 
150–330 mPa and calorific values in the range of 36–40 kJ g −1. 
These values were close to those of fuel oil. As shown by the 
energy balance, the liquefaction method is a total 
energy producer.
Similarly, Demirbas (2010)  achieved a maximum output of 
64% dry wt. based on oil liquefaction at 300 °C catalyzed by 
sodium carbonate in a study on oil recovery using Botryococcus 
braunii. The development of microalgae occurs much faster 
than on land. It is predicted that 20,000–80,000 L of oil are 
produced annually per acre of algae, which is 7–31 times 
greater than the next best crop of palm oil. Open ponds, 
photobioreactors, and closed systems are industrial reactors 
for algae culture.
Aresta et  al. (2005)  examined various conversion strategies 
to manufacture microalgal biodiesel, including organic solvent 
extraction, supercritical CO 2, pyrolysis, and hydrothermal 
technology. For the mining of microalgae biodiesel, the 
hydrothermal-liquefaction approach proved more successful 
than utilizing supercritical CO 2. It is reasonable to assume 
that hydrothermal liquefaction is the most effective technological 
solution for producing biodiesel from algae among the 
selected methods.
The incorporation of nanosized materials, such as nanofibers, 
nanoparticles, nanotubes, nanosheets, and other nanostructures. 
A novel method incorporating aluminum sulfate-coated magnetic 
particles was highly effective at isolating microalgae species 
of the Anabaena and the Aphanizomenon genus from a mixed 
culture. The use of silver nanoparticles to increase the harvest 
of Cyanothece 51,142 and Chlamydomonas reinhardtii microalgae 
resulted in a 3-fold increase ( Pattarkine and Pattarkine, 2012 ; 
Safarik et  al., 2016 ).
The following enzymes, used in conjunction with polymer 
nanoparticles such as polyacrylonitrile nanofibers, iron oxide, 
and nanoporous gold; silica nanoparticles with lipase from Rhizopus 
miehei; ferric silica and magnetic nanoparticles with lipase from 
Burkholderia sp.; and polyacrylonitrile nanofibers, successfully 
transformed plant oils into biodiesel via the transesterification 
process: Pseudomonas cepacia lipase, Rizopus miehei lipase, ferric 
silica, and magnetic nanoparticles with lipase from Burkholderia 
sp., and polyacrylonitrile nanofibers ( Palaniappan, 2017 ). In 
addition, a nanomagnetic biocatalyst, composed of lithium-doped 
CaO, KF/CaO–Fe3O4, Fe2O3–CaO, and sulfate, integrated sodium 
titanate, zirconium, and carbon-based nanotubes and nanoparticles 
to yield up to 95% or more biodiesel from a variety of biomass 
and biodegradable waste ( Liu et  al., 2018 ).
Apart from increasing the efficiency of biodiesel production, 
a type of NP called zeolite has been employed commercially 
as an absorbent within the transesterification process. Zeolites 
consumed the unwanted moisture content (4–6%) from biodiesel. 
Mesoporous nanoparticles have also demonstrated a critical 
aptitude for regular microalgal-biofuel synthesis without cell 
lysis. Additionally, zeolites extract lipids from the microalgae 
cell membrane ( Liu et  al., 2008 ).
Moog et  al. (2019)  created a microbial cell factory utilizing 
the photosynthetic microalga Phaeodactylum tricornutum  to 
produce and secrete an engineered version of PETase into the 
surrounding culture medium. Initial studies utilizing 3D culture 
weightless at 30 °C examined PETase activity vs. PET and the 
copolymer polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG); the 
low-crystallinity PETG had an 80-fold higher turnover than 
bottle-grade PET. The breakdown products of the PET substrate 
were TPA and MHET.
Chlorella pyrenoidosa was grown to produce biofuel and bioplastic. 
The maximal growth took 10 days. The strain grew faster in the 
presence of CO2. The chemically processed algal biomass produced 
bioplastic. The 14-day-old algal culture contained 27% 
polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB). This ensures that the microalgae-
derived bioplastic is biodegradable. The microalgae detoxified 
chromium and nickel by 11.24 and 33.89% ( Das et  al., 2018 ). 
Table  4 summarizes the literature on biodegradable algae enzymes.

Factors Affecting Microbial Degradation of 
PLA-PET Waste
Environmental variables, such as pH, humidity, temperature, 
salinity, quantity of oxygen, sunshine, water, stress, and culture 
conditions, have a meaningful effect on the microbial population 
and enzyme activity ( Oliveira et  al., 2020 ). Owing to their 
metabolic machinery, as well as their ability to adapt to hostile 
settings, microorganisms can destroy a wide range of organic 
contaminants. Consequently, microbes play an important role in 
site rehabilitation. However, their efficiency is conditional on a 
range of factors, including the chemical composition and quantity 
of pollutants, their presence in microorganisms, and the physical 
and chemical features of the environment. These are microbiological 
and genetic factors or environmental influences (Gupta et al., 2017).
When fungi grow at the lowest pH possible, the most CO 2 
is produced, and the strongest lignolytic activity occurs ( Kumar 
and Chandra, 2020). The biodegradability of polyester is dominated 
by chemical factors and the physical characteristics of polyester. 
A significant aspect related to plastic biodegradation is the 
molecular weight. A low molecular weight is beneficial for 
biodegradation. The increases in the molecular weight of poly 
(e-caprolactone) diols resulted in an increase in the rate of EH 
of poly (e-caprolactone) diol by Rhizopus delemar lipase (Valderrama 
et  al., 2019). The melting point of the polymers strongly impacts 
polymer enzymatic degradability. Polyester is usually more durable 
and less biodegradable when it has a higher melting point. 
Polymer degradation was decreased with the help of improvements 
in crystallinity and flexibility (Siracusa, 2019). Additives, stabilizers, 
and antioxidants used in the manufacture of polymers can delay 
degradation and may be  toxic to microorganisms ( Allen and 
Edge, 2021). Apart from structural considerations (linearity and 
branching in polymers, bond types, such as carbon–carbon, 
amide, and ester), the physical form of the polymer (powder, 
films, pellets, and fibers) may also affect a polymer’s biodegradability. 
Ultimately, the degradation rate is determined by the mechanism 
of degradation and the process acceleration ( Vohlídal, 2021).
Different plastic polymers are electromagnetic radiation 
sensitive owing to their ability to absorb intense solar radiation 
(Hegazy et al., 2009 ). Chemical reagents included in polymeric 
structures can alter functional groups along with hydrophilicity/
hydrophobicity (additives). It has been demonstrated that 
hydrogen peroxide, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, and nitric 
acid all oxidize polymer surfaces ( Moharir and Kumar, 2019 ). 
The observed increase in mineralization rate and carbon-fixing 
during PE degradation was ascribed to the use of chemicals 
that enhanced polymer oxidation ( Jakubowicz, 2003 ).
Potential Biogas Production Using 
PLA-PET Plastic Waste
Food waste is used to produce biogas, which is made up of 
enormous amounts of methane (Nanda and Berruti; Luo and 
Wong, 2019). Nevertheless, anaerobic digestion (AD) digesters 
are not typically used for the breakdown of plastic ( Sánchez, 
2020). In anaerobic conditions only, the methanogenic stage 
of the AD process is used for simple substrates ( Treu et  al., 
2019; Y an et  al., 2019). In addition, typical AD systems often 
keep the working pH at 6.8–8.0, which is not favorable for 
the breakdown of plastic when contrasted with a pH range 
with a lower value (e.g., pH ~4–6; Pathak and Navneet, 2017 ; 
Srisowmeya et  al., 2020 ). A field emission-scanning electron 
microscope was used to analyze the time taken for disposable 
plastics (e.g., PP , PS, and HDPE) to degrade in a typical AD 
process, which showed that the procedure had limited success 
in degrading plastics ( Lim et  al., 2018 ). More recently ( Zhang 
et  al., 2018 , 2019), following a 65-day anaerobic breakdown 
of plastic, it was revealed that the percentage of solid material 
in LDPE and PP was lowered by 1.5 and 2.0%, respectively. 
Regardless of how plastic waste is biodegraded, with some 
microorganisms emerging as a study subject, there is still a 
long way to go before petroleum-based plastics can be considered 
biodegradable ( Baskaran and Rajamanickam, 2019 ; Gunawan 
et  al., 2020 ; Li et  al., 2020 ). A major research gap that has 
been identified is a microorganism capable of digesting plastic 
is as a model organism for further detailed research. Researchers 
should focus on finding potential bacteria that degrade plastics 
so that the biodegradation of plastics can be  made highly 
efficient ( Sánchez, 2020 ; Carmen, 2021 ; Matjašič et  al., 2021 ).
The physical and chemical properties of the polymers are 
generally assessed through the direct observation of the anaerobic 
degradation process (Day et al., 1994). A number of the evaluated 
properties, including mass loss, mechanical property reduction, 
altered thermal behavior through scanning electron microscopy,

infrared spectroscopy, gel permeation chromatography, and 
exclusion chromatography, all revealed microbial invasion (Rivard 
et  al., 1995; Massardier-Nageotte et  al., 2006; Y agi et  al., 2009, 
2012, 2014; Hermanová et  al., 2015 ; Selke et  al., 2015 ; Lee 
et  al., 2016 ). These methods provide evidence of breakdown, 
but they cannot ascertain the degree of degradation or tell 
whether it was caused by microbes or other activities.
Anaerobic degradation is a type of nonoxygenated biological 
deterioration. It uses organic matter as an electron donor or 
acceptor, whereas anaerobic respiration uses CO 2, SO 4
−2, and 
NO3
−. Hydration, acidification, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis 
are the four steps. Fermentation creates two-thirds of the CH 4, 
whereas respiration produces one-third. Acidity, temperature, 
redox potential, and hydrogen concentration all affect anaerobic 
biodegradation efficiency. It also depends on the microbe 
concentration, nutritional levels, and substrate qualities ( Mohee 
et  al., 2008 ). The waste in landfills is diverse, complicating 
biodegradation. Anaerobic decomposition has five stages. The 
initial hydrolysis reduces pH, increases CO 2 demand, and 
concentrates volatile fatty acids, ammonia, and sulfates. Step  2 
is acidogenesis, which generates H 2. Acetate, hydrogen, and 
CO2 are produced in Step  3. Step  4 is methanogenesis, which 
produces biogas. In Step 5, stabilization reduces biogas generation 
and increases the N 2 concentration. Abiotic and biotic factors 
influence biodegradation. However, the treatment and 
recirculating of leachate has been demonstrated to increase 
biodegradation rates, enhancing the role of landfill as a bioreactor 
(Cossu et al., 2018 ). The differences between the biodegradation 
processes of PLA-PET waste under aerobic and anaerobic 
conditions are shown in Figure  2.
The breakdown of plastics results from various causes that 
may be  physical, chemical, or biological. The mechanism is 
material- and condition-dependent. Exposure to UV light, 
temperature, mechanical stress, oxidative, hydrolytic, and 
biodegradative conditions causes damage. Plastics break down 
anaerobically in enclosed vessels or spaces; therefore, oxygen 
and ozone oxidation are irrelevant. For polyolefins and PS, free 
radicals are thought to cause consecutive cleavages along the 
polymeric chain. Free radicals are created through a UV-stimulated 
radiation process for polyethylene ( Singh and Sharma, 2008 ).
Temperature and pH control the rate of degradation. The 
proposed biodegradation processes for polymers, such as PHBV , 
include colonization, hydrolysis, the erosion of exposed sections, 
saturation, and fragmentation. Microbes attack amorphous starch 
zones on polyethylene–starch copolymers, allowing entrance 
into interior holes. Therefore, the degradation of the polyethylene 
matrix occurs after starch consumption ( Singh and Sharma, 
2008). Depending on the test settings, plastics degrade at 
varying rates. Compared with other PHAs, this material increased 
biogas generation by 62%. In contrast, PHB decomposed 90% 
in 14 days at 55 °C, which was equivalent to cellulose. However, 
only 23% of anaerobic sludge degradation was achieved in 
10 weeks ( Y agi et  al., 2014 ). When eggshell was utilized to 
make a biocomposite, the degradation of PCL rose from 80% 
over 50 days to negligible at 55 °C. PBS was also degraded at 
25.8 and 32.5% under thermophilic circumstances, but did 
not mineralize when tested at 55 °C ( Petit et  al., 2015 ).
Polylactic acid biodegradation has been reported as anything 
from total mineralization to complete biodegradation, with 
complete biodegradation taking place in under 100 days ( Selke 
et  al., 2015). The L-lactic acid treatment of PET waste resulted 
in a random distribution of co-monomeric units ( Hermanová 
et al., 2015). Hydrolytic and/or biodegradable co-polyesters were 
created by combining aromatic and aliphatic units. Sample A 
generated a theoretical yield of 69% methane-rich biogas, whereas 
sample D generated 34%. The starting content and chain length 
of aromatic sequences reduced the anaerobic biodegradation 
rate. Notably, insoluble degradation intermediates were expected 
alongside soluble intermediates, depending on how long it takes 
to hydrolyze aromatic trimers and oligomers to dimers and 
monomers. Aromatic oligomers and monomers degrade in sludge.
The biodegradable starch-based polymers Mater Bi and 
Ecostarplus behaved differently when biodegraded anaerobically 
(Day et  al., 1994 ). In the Mater Bi samples, it appeared that 
the starch was readily attacked by bacteria, leading to significant 
CH4 evolution and weight loss. However, the Ecostarplus polymer 
demonstrated minimal CH 4 evolution and weight reduction.
Many biocomposites include starch because of its inexpensive 
cost, high permeability, and natural biodegradability by 
microorganisms. Biodegradation occurs solely for starch in 
polyolefin composites, indicating that these composites were not 
fundamentally biodegradable. The starch in these composites only 
partially biodegrades owing to the presence of a starch matrix. 
Biodegradation rates for composites with a biodegradable matrix 
ranged from 10.2 to 53% ( Y agi et  al., 2014). During polymer 
degradation, new products such as CO2, H2O, or CH4 are formed, 
resulting in the formation of process end products ( Lucas et  al., 
2008). Aerobic degradation necessitates the presence of oxygen 
as the final electron acceptor. During the degradation of plastics, 
aerobic conditions lead to the production of CO 2 and H 2O, as 
well as cellular biomass from microorganisms. When polymer 
biodegradation occurs in sulfidogenic conditions, CO2 and H 2O 
are produced as byproducts. Anaerobic polymer degradation 
yields organic acids, H 2O, CO 2, and methane as byproducts. 
Anaerobic decomposition is less efficient for energy production 
than aerobic degradation, involving CO 2 and SO 4
−2, because of 
the absence of O2, which serves as an electron acceptor (Gottschalk, 
1986). Anaerobic degradation occurs through a different method, 
i.e., the burial of the polymer sets off a complex chain of chemical 
and biological reactions. Aerobic bacteria deplete oxygen in the 
buried materials. The following oxygen-depleted conditions initiate 
anaerobic biodegradation. In most cases, 3-m–thick layers prevent 
oxygen replenishment. It may begin with alternative electron 
acceptors, such as nitrate, sulfate, or methane. Any further addition 
of oxygen will stop the anaerobic degradation process (Glaser, 2019).
ENVIRONMENTAL WASTE: 
BIODEGRADABLE PLASTIC 
PRODUCTION
Among all the environmental pollutants and contamination-causing 
agents, the accumulation of single-use plastic made from

nonbiodegradable materials in the marine and terrestrial 
environments is very harmful and has toxic effects on human 
and marine health. Biodegradable plastic and bioplastic, which 
includes plastics composed of biodegradable polymers, as well as 
effective biobased recycling strategies offer the only realistic 
alternative that can achieve a safe and sustainable environment 
for humans and animals (Emadian et  al., 2017; Abdelmoez et  al., 
2021). In an effort to reduce the massive plastic problem, the 
production and use of biodegradable plastic is more important 
role than other existing strategies. Many responsible countries, 
including the United  States and China, have planned to increase 
the production facilities for biodegradable plastics and reduce the 
production of traditional, single-use plastics (Ma et al., 2020; Shen 
et al., 2020). Biodegradable plastics are mainly made from renewable 
resources, including biobased and fossil-fuel sources, such as food 
waste and agricultural residues ( Havstad, 2020). Biodegradable 
plastics are the only realistic solution to the problem of plastic 
pollution in the environment.
Food Waste
Food waste is one of the main spreading waste worldwide 
and it is considered a cheap carbon source for the production 
of PHAs. High-quality poly-L-lactate (PLLA) biodegradable 
plastic was produced from food wastes through a combination 
of chemical processes and fermentation. A novel system composed 
of D, L-lactic acid removal by Propionibacterium from minced 
food waste, which was followed by the purification, esterification, 
and polymerization of L-lactic acid ( Sakai et  al., 2003 ). This 
process produced high quantities of PLLA with high activity, 
but used relatively little energy and had limited emissions. 
Furthermore, there was no difference in the physical properties 
of PLLA, produced by this method and PLLA produced 
commercial from L-lactic acid. Researchers have put significant 
effort into the production of PHA from food waste as the 
production of PHA from food waste is the best alternative to 
waste disposal.
Palm oil waste has been used as a carbon source for the 
synthesis of mcl-polyhydroxyalkanoates (mcl-PHAs) from the 
Pseudomonas sp. Gl01 strain ( Fukui and Doi, 1998 ). The 
characterization showed that this polymer consisted of C6 to 
C16 monomers. Another study examined genetic modifications 
of E. coli that may enhance the synthesis of PHA from cheese 
whey and reduce the production of organic acid. P(3HB) 
homopolymer and P(3HB- co-5 mol% 3HHx) copolymer were 
FIGURE 2 | Biodegradation processes of PLA-PET plastic waste under different conditions. Biodegradation occurs under two main conditions: aerobic and anaerobic. 
For aerobic degradation, oxygen is necessary; in contrast, for anaerobic degradation, oxygen is needed at the start of the process, but not needed after a while. Both 
conditions use different enzymes that affect the molecular weight, mechanical strength, and surface properties. In one comparison, aerobic degradation occurs much 
faster than anaerobic degradation (Glaser, 2019). In anaerobic conditions, less energy is released compared with in aerobic conditions. The end products of the 
degradation are microbial biomass, CO2, H2O, and energy in aerobic digestion and extra products, namely CH4 and organic acids in anaerobic digestion.

effectively synthesized by providing soybean oil as a carbon 
source to Cupriavidus necator H16 and its recombinant strain 
(Murugan et  al., 2016 ). The malt waste from a beer brewery 
plant, soya waste, and sucrose were also investigated substrates 
for the production of PHAs; malt waste resulted in the highest 
production of polymers ( Yu et  al., 1999 ).
Agricultural Residues
Compared with traditional plastic, the production of 
biodegradable plastic consumes less energy and reduces waste, 
CO2, and greenhouse gas emissions. Biodegradable plastics 
produced from agricultural residue can enhance soil fertility. 
In the agricultural sector, biodegradable mulch films offer an 
environmentally friendly alternative to traditional plastic mulch 
film. Problems associated with traditional plastic mulch film, 
such as reduced fertilizer effectiveness, poor soil fertility, and 
malnutrition, can be  prevented by using biodegradable mulch 
film. The production of biodegradable plastic from agricultural 
residues for the mulch film is an interesting solution to related 
problems. The plastic products used in our daily life can 
be produced from polymers that can rapidly degrade, reducing 
the pressure of landfill sites. Biodegradable polymers produced 
from renewable resources are likely to prove irreplaceable in 
high-value markets, such as medical sutures, drug-delivery 
materials, and orthopedic needles ( Shen et  al., 2009 , 2020).
The production of PHA using cane molasses and the waste 
from ethanol production as a substrate has been reported from 
different parts of plants ( Verlinden et  al., 2007; Khiyami et  al., 
2011). PHB was produced from wheat straw and bagasse 
hydrolysate, which are renewable sources of agriculture residue 
(Yu and Chen, 2008 ; Galia, 2010). Xie et al. (2020)  also studied 
the preparation of biopolymers film containing potato peel 
powder, curcumin, and bacterial cellulose. Their results showed 
that the incorporation of bacterial cellulose in the PP matrix 
increased the mechanical properties of the biopolymer films, 
reduced water vapor and oxygen permeability, and reduced 
light transmission.
Accumulating Bacteria
Scientists in this area of research prefer the use of microbes 
for the production of biodegradable plastic owing to their 
easy handling, maintenance, purification, and susceptibility to 
genetic modification for the desired properties ( Mostafa et  al., 
2020; Narayanan et  al., 2021 ). Polyhydroxybutyrates are 
macromolecules synthesized by bacteria. These are inclusion 
bodies accumulate when bacteria are subjected to stress. 
Polyhydroxybutyrates have similar properties to synthetic 
thermoplastics and good mechanical, physical, and immunological 
properties that make them an excellent biopolymer ( Verlinden 
et  al., 2007 ; Galia, 2010 ; Khiyami et  al., 2011 ). To achieve 
industrial production, different microorganisms are being studied 
for their ability to produce different qualities and quantities 
of polyhydroxybutyrates with different decomposition rates 
(Natarajan, 2011; Juengert et al., 2018 ). Bacteria are most often 
used for their fabrication as they are able to produce the 
greatest biomass in the shortest time, and have simple downstream 
processes and more possibilities for gene modification compared 
with fungi, yeasts, and algae ( Kumarasamy et  al., 2020; Soman 
et  al., 2020a ,b). Azoto-bacter vinelandii , E. coli , Pseudomonas 
oleovorans, Halomonas campaniensis , Alteromonas lipolytica , 
Aeromonas sp., Bacillus megaterium , Methylobacteria sp., 
Herbaspirillum seropedicae, and Alcaligenes latus are the most 
commonly used of the 300+ bacterial species that can accumulate 
polyhydroxybutyrates and polyhydroxyalkanoates ( Rendón-
Villalobos et  al., 2016 ; Shi et  al., 2017 ; Tufail et  al., 2017 ; 
Gabr, 2018 ). Potential PHB-producing bacterial strains were 
isolated and the production of PHB was evaluated using 
agricultural residues as the carbon source ( Getachew and 
Woldesenbet, 2016). The optimum conditions for PHB production 
were pH 7, 37°C, and an incubation period of 48 h with shaking 
at 120 rpm.
PYROLYSIS: WASTE INTO ENERGY
Oil can be  described as a dark blood that flows through the 
veins of the global elite. As a major power source, it has 
brought prosperity to the developing world. However, the 
continued resources of oil are uncertain and can be  expected 
to fluctuate dramatically owing to restrictions on supply. Power 
is important to all areas of society. The major improvements 
and developments in society over the past 200 years have been 
driven by the use of nonrenewable energy resources. The 
maximum usage of petroleum products will soon be  reached. 
Therefore, sound strategies for determined new sources are 
essential, especially for unrefined oil. It is important to consider 
several sources potential sources of oil; however, to obtain a 
realistic viewpoint, the factors that affect the production of 
hydrocarbons must be  considered. The use of plastic waste 
and EH may play an important role in the production of 
bio-oil. In addition, changing the structure or the surface 
functionality of plastic using enzyme hydrolysis may improve 
the quality and yield of pyrolytic bio-oil.
Thermal Pyrolysis of PLA-PET
Polyethene terephthalate is an essential substance that is abundant 
in a variety of areas, such as food, electrical cables, and scientific 
equipment. Bioaccumulation and poisonous gasoline when 
igniting are common problems (Zimmermann, 2020). Therefore, 
as a necessity, the problem of plastic waste needs to be  solved 
to prevent climate change and to improve human health. The 
typical recycling processes for plastic waste are shown in 
Figure 3. There are exclusive disposal strategies for PET waste, 
although all modern techniques have regulations. For example, 
incineration is a regular disposal method for solid urban waste 
(MSW; Kim et  al., 2010 ). Although it may not be  difficult to 
handle, and that it prevents an opportunity to reduce plastic 
waste, air pollutants such as dioxins, furans, mercury, and 
polychlorinated biphenyls are released (Diaz-Silvarrey et al., 2018). 
It could also result in the destruction of potential material 
that could have been disposed of as PET waste ( Verma et  al., 
2016). In addition, constructs that live after PETs have been 
burned pollute the soil by leaching out metals such as lead 
Tamoor et al. Plastic Conversion Through Microbial Enzymes
Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 14 November 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 777727
and cadmium ( Raheem et  al., 2019 ). Reuse is also an option, 
and is considered as it is very environmentally friendly and 
prevents the destruction of items ( Jamdar et  al., 2017 ). In 
addition, sorting plastic before reuse requires extra labor (Gurgul 
et  al., 2018 ). Therefore, a more feasible and reliable approach 
to PET waste disposal is required.
Another treatment method is pyrolysis, i.e., thermal treatment 
without oxygen (Kim et  al., 2020c). This method has been used 
for various waste materials, including plastic (Kwon et al., 2019). 
The advantages are that it can reduce the amount of waste and 
transfer the estimated substances introduced by means of combined 
heat and power ( Kim et  al., 2020c ). Valuable objects such as 
pyrolysis oil and gasoline have too great a thermal power, and 
this can be  converted into a pyrolysis plant to satisfy the power 
requirements (Bridgwater and Peacocke, 2000 ). Heat treatment 
is considered because it is preferred not to require complex 
skills or extreme work cycles; moreover, it could not use plastic 
in any way like traditional techniques ( Adrados et  al., 2012 ). 
Although pyrolysis has several advantages over other methods 
of plastic waste recycling, its drawback is the generation of 
FIGURE 3 |  Pyrolytic process for the conversion of plastic waste into energy. Plastic to oil or other fuel (PTF) conversion technology is discussed here, as well as 
the possible reductions in CO2 emissions and other environmental advantages that might result if the Resources Recovery Authorities implemented these 
technologies. Plastics can be converted to oil or other fuels via pyrolysis. Before pyrolysis, plastic waste is shredded and cleaned for pretreatment, followed by the 
conversion of plastic waste to gas. The gas is converted to a liquid via distillation, and the acids formed during the breakdown of certain scrap plastics will 
be removed to prevent any corrosion of the PTF systems and engines. The final steps are the separating, refining, and blending of the fuel.
Tamoor et al. Plastic Conversion Through Microbial Enzymes
Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 15 November 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 777727
hazardous substances, such as polycyclic compounds and biphenyls, 
which can have to serious impact on ecological systems and 
human health if not properly managed ( Kim et  al., 2020d). For 
example, polycyclic aromatic compounds (PAHs) can be exchanged 
with particulate oxygen-containing PAHs, which are sometimes 
present in natural smoke concentrates, through a reaction with 
NOx and O 3 ( Gbeddy et  al., 2020). To ensure a strong, natural 
approach to PET waste disposal, the whole process must 
be  considered and polycyclic fragments should be  avoided.
The pyrolysis of reagents has been used to study thermal 
efficiency and the incorporation of alternative pyrolytic objects 
(Lee et  al., 2020 ). Although most studies on the pyrolysis of 
reagents have used zeolites, because of the current impetus to 
increase the yield of bio-oil and, similarly, to increase the 
reaction yield ( Kim et  al., 2019a ). In addition, owing to the 
coke reinforcement, zeolites are not available at excessively 
high temperatures ( Kim et  al., 2019b ). Upheld’s decent metal 
pulses are thermally stable and show excessive movement at 
excessive temperatures ( Kim et  al., 2020b); however, from now 
on they can be  used in pyrolysis, which is conducted at high 
temperatures. For example, a Pt pulse, maintained in activated 
carbon, has been used extensively in the pyrolysis of food 
waste to reduce the build-up of harmful artificial species during 
pyrolysis ( He et  al., 2012 ).
Catalytic Fast Pyrolysis of PLA-PET
The biotreatment process of plastic waste is believed to enhance 
the performance of pyrolysis, including increased thermal 
conversion rate and selectivity, and a decrease in the required 
temperature. Many recent reports have discussed the importance 
of enzymatic treatment before the pyrolysis process for lignin, 
which is high molecular weight insoluble polymer. Unfortunately, 
there are no reports discussing the importance of enzymatic 
treatment before thermal pyrolysis of plastic waste. Enzymatic 
treatment of plastic waste before thermal pyrolysis can help 
to decrease the activation energy and pre-exponential factor 
of the thermal pyrolysis of plastic waste. Wang et  al. (2020)  
used the enzymatic treatment of lignin before thermal pyrolysis, 
which significantly enhanced the performance and selectivity 
of pyrolysis at lower temperatures and decreased the 
activation energy.
Thermochemical measures (ignition, gasification, pyrolysis, 
and torrefaction) are among the best techniques to gain additional 
energy from starch biomass ( Bridgwater, 2012 ). One of the 
more promising thermochemical methods, pyrolysis, produces 
a liquid powder. Rapid pyrolysis occurs between 300 and 500 °C 
in an oxygen-free or oxygen-restricted atmosphere with high 
heat loads (>1,000 °C/min) and a rapid vapor cooling period. 
Bio-oil yields in the range of 60–70% by weight cannot always 
be  realized.
Bio-oil is a complex natural mixture that contains 
low-molecular-weight biomass. Normally, it is refined for different 
utilizations ( Bridgwater et  al., 2009 ). Lignocellulosic biomass 
feedstocks, such as rural deposits, are a water-based mixture 
of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin, extractives, and minerals (P , 
K, Ca, Mg, and Na).
Many of these minerals help to catalyze secondary responses 
that alter the yields of liquid, solid, and gaseous products during 
fast pyrolysis ( Akhtar and Amin, 2012 ). Excellent organic oil 
at some point in the pyrolysis depends on the desired product 
and the degree of oxygen-containing compounds, specific 
conditions were used, particularly to intensify the deoxygenation 
reactions at a certain stage of the pyrolysis, e.g., Zeolites and 
steel oxides ( Zhang et al., 2009 ). After the oil has accumulated, 
various measures, such as hydrocracking, esterification, reagent 
degradation, etc. ( Goldberg et  al., 2015 ) were used to refine 
the bio-oil. In addition, the oil fit is critical to capacity and 
transportation so that it does not deteriorate with unpredictable 
additional polymer designs (Carlson et al., 2008 ). In one model, 
Atadana (2010) performed pyrolysis of the reagent with HZSM5 
zeolite in biomass washed with NaOH to improve the yields 
of levoglucosan and caramel odor compounds. It was found 
that this reaction drove the formation of water at a certain 
stage of pyrolysis, which results in an excessive moisture content 
in the oil. In addition, zeolite pulses are quite expensive, which 
makes a cheaper alternative very attractive.
Lu et al. (2010) studied metal oxide nanoparticles in pyrolyzed 
wood waste (MgO, CaO, TiO 2, Fe 2O3, NiO, and ZnO). When 
all the solids were removed, it was discovered that the calcium 
oxide underwent major alterations and that the admission of 
anhydrous phenols, acids, and sugars had stopped. Pen tested 
the effect of calcium and potassium salts in the pyrolysis of 
biomass and a large number of carboxylic acids and furans 
and a lower oxygen content in the oil ( Goldberg et  al., 2015 ). 
Mullen et  al. (2011)  conducted a brief pyrolysis of sawdust 
in a fluidized-bed reactor using two successive Ca pulses. The 
two CO and CO 2 pulses used in conjunction decreased the 
oxygen concentration of the oil. In addition, they found a 
reduced mean output with natural caustic. Wang et  al. (2010)  
conducted investigations with two pulse types: acid zeolite 
MCM41 and essential CaO. The pyrolysis was performed on 
a TGA-FTIR for the advantageous cluster area, although it is 
not always a short pyrolysis because the heating load is only 
90°C/min. Their results verified that the yield of corrosives 
decreased, along with a range of hydrocarbons. Acid production 
was reduced by the use of CaO, and the CaCO 3 that was 
created had the potential to degrade into ketones and water. 
Calcium oxide has been reported by Lin et al. (2010)  to induce 
the pyrolysis of pine sawdust in a fluidized-bed reaction on 
the scale of a study facility (180–1,000 g/h). The percentage 
of biomass/pulse was modified (0–30%). The yields of formic 
acid, levoglucosan, phenol, acetone, and guaiacol decreased as 
the content of CaO was increased, and various mineral impulses 
were also tested (Beaumont and Schwob, 1984). Overall, reactive 
pyrolysis is attractive when you  consider that it benefits from 
the warm inert temperature of the vapors after pyrolysis.
During a synergistic in situ pyrolysis the impulse fragments 
are mixed with ( Lin et  al., 2009 ) or essentially displace the 
fluidizing medium (Williams and Nugranad, 2000). Unfortunately, 
this type of association typically has problems with catalyst 
deactivation and requires chronic pulse regeneration and 
replacement. In contrast, ex situ  reagent pyrolysis structures 
generally have a solid cushion after the fluidization sector of 
Tamoor et al. Plastic Conversion Through Microbial Enzymes
Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 16 November 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 777727
the reactor. At the same time, this type of structure has much 
smaller deactivation momentum, which increases domestic smoke 
cases and improves response to polling breaks. This shows the 
potential of in situ synergistic pyrolysis to provide higher caliber oils.
Challenges Associated With Thermal 
Pyrolysis of PLA-PET
Recycling plastic waste has emerged as one method of reducing 
plastic pollution; however, this generally requires large labor 
costs and, at some stages in processing, create ignited water. If 
plastic recycling can support the liquids with tribological effects, 
such as lubricating oils, this is a convenient pathway to eliminate 
plastics in the environment. To understand potential tribological 
uses of recycled plastic, it is important to study techniques that 
can be  used to convert waste plastic into completely petroleum-
based oils. The viscosity, density, and friction of pyrolyzed waste 
plastic oils are examined and evaluated in comparison to 
commercial lubricants to determine their function and lubrication 
effects. Segregation strategies, catalytic isomerization dewaxing, 
and the Fischer-Tropsch method for recycling plastic waste have 
also been examined to obtain insight into techniques for converting 
pyrolyzed plastic waste into lubricants ( Sikdar et  al., 2020 ).
The separation of other plastics from PLA and PET can 
be  difficult can be  difficult; naturally, this impacts the ability to 
recycle these materials. The purpose of this test is to examine 
the feasibility of recycling mixed PLA and PET waste via a 
copyrolysis method. Samples containing significant levels of 
pre-processed PLA and PET waste were subjected to the relevant 
studies using thermogravimetric (TG) and reaction kinetic analyses. 
Finally, pyrolytic studies based solely on the determined TG 
reaction conditions were completed to investigate the yields of 
the pyrolytic reactions. The results indicated that the HHV of 
PLA and domestic animal was approximately 18.26 and 22.85 MJ/
kg, respectively, and that of the combinations fell between those 
values. Each sample has a combustible fraction of more than 
96% and a maximum decomposition temperature between 618 
and 736 K. Additional PET ratios were determined to lead to 
higher activation energies and pre-exponential elements. In addition, 
the PLA ratios were correlated with the mass yield of carbonated 
goods, whereas the PET ratios were correlated with the yields 
of resistant and condensing products. To avoid potential issues 
with strength and performance, the copyrolysis of PLA and PET 
can also mitigate the need to decompose PLA and PET, which 
can contribute to a reduction in plastic waste ( Tai, 2015).
The linear economic system for plastic packaging, which currently 
results in the emission of too much CO2 and the release of plastic 
into the environment, needs to be  reformed into a more spherical 
and ecologically focused model that is resource- and environmentally 
friendly throughout the plastics value chain, from product develop, 
to recycling, and with the abandonment of existing alternatives. 
This review highlights areas in which those who are inexperienced 
in chemistry can make contributions. Replacing plastics derived 
from fossil fuel sources with fully renewable biobased options 
can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and produce plastics that 
are much less complex to recycle and biodegrade at the end of 
their useful existence in the environment. The underlying chemical 
and biocatalytic production for plastic production and recycling 
has been reviewed and priorities for future improvements have 
been identified (Sheldon and Norton, 2020).
Polymers such as polyamides or nylon, PET, polycarbonate 
(PC), and polyurethane (PE) are known as condensation polymers 
because, in addition to carbon (C) atoms, they consist of certain 
atoms such as oxygen (O) and nitrogen (N). They can be degraded 
by hydrolytic cleavage as hydrophilic ester or amide bonds are 
present in their monomers. Biodegradation begins at the same 
time that the molecular weight of the polymers reaches several 
thousands, which is usually a low value for commercial polymers 
(Bonhomme et  al., 2003 ). Another difficulty affecting the 
biodegradation and pyrolysis of polymers is their crystallinity. 
The specific physical phenomena that occur within the pyrolysis 
pathway depend on the material. Thermosetting polymers are 
insoluble and therefore their modification phase is not feasible 
during pyrolysis. However, thermoplastics can be softened within 
the pyrolysis reaction with reversible phase modifications until 
a minimum pyrolysis temperature is reached ( Brostow and 
Lobland, 2016 ). There are no completely crystalline polymers, 
but there are completely amorphous polymers. A crystalline 
material under a given voltage has a single melting temperature, 
but no variety; similarly, the glass transition occurs over a 
variety of temperatures, but not at a single temperature.
The biodegradation of polymers is based on the chemical 
and physical properties of the polymer. The crystallinity and 
molecular weight of the polymer are key factors that help 
biodegradation. Increasing the molecular weight of a polymer 
reduces its degradability ( Tokiwa et  al., 2009 ). For example, 
polymeric polycaprolactone (PCL) with a molecular weight of 
>4,000 is slowly degraded by a hydrolysis pathway using a 
Rhizopus delemar lipase, unlike PCL that has a lower molecular 
weight. Various enzymes from microorganisms are a useful 
resource for the biodegradation of polymers through oxidation 
and hydrolysis processes. Crystallinity also affects the rate of 
biodegradation in biopolymers. In the absence of additives, 
many commercial polymeric substances may encounter obstacles 
to their use. However, it was found that additives such as 
phthalates and bisphenol can damage human health through 
their impact on natural reactions ( Meeker et  al., 2009 ).
CONCLUSION AND FUTURE 
PERSPECTIVE
The enormous problems arising from the accumulation of different 
plastic wastes has attracted the attention of scientists worldwide. 
The correct use of this waste may be a “hidden treasure, ” especially 
for the conversion and production of various value-added products. 
A variety of plastic-degrading enzymes have been recently 
discovered, widening the potential applications for mixed-plastic 
waste biodegradations. Moreover, there is a very urgent need 
for safe and nontoxic alternatives to fossil fuel-based plastics, 
such as biodegradable plastics like polyhydroxyalkanoates, which 
can be  more easily degraded by microorganisms. Diethyl-2,5-
furandicarboxylate and diethyl isophthalate are also promising 
alternatives to fossil fuel-based plastics and can be easily produced

by enzymatic catalysis. Biodegradable plastics can be  produced 
from food waste, agricultural residues, and polyhydroxybutyrate-
accumulating bacteria. The thermal pyrolysis of mixed-plastic 
waste is also a very important method that may overcome the 
depletion of natural crude oil. A possible hybrid integration 
technique to incorporate thermostable plastic degradation enzymes 
in the conversion into fuel oils requires further investigations. 
The discovery of highly thermostable enzymes is essential for 
the development of mixed-plastic waste thermal pyrolysis.
