Ultraviolet Ozone Pretreatment Enhances Selective PETase
Biodegradation of Textiles Compared to Sunlight and
Alkali Treatments
Sariah Giraldo-Narcizo, Antonio Guerrero,* and Ana Maria Sanchez-Pérez*
The rapid growth of the fashion industry has led to increasing
textile waste, exacerbating environmental pollution and climate
change. To support sustainability and circular economy goals, this
study investigates the enzymatic degradation of cotton/polyeth-
ylene terephthalate (PET) mixed textiles using PETase, comparing
wild-type and mutant (MUT S238F/W159H) variants. To improve
enzyme accessibility, three pretreatment strategies are evaluated:
alkali treatment, UV–ozone (UVO) exposure, and natural sunlight
weathering. The effects are assessed by measuring textile weight
loss, surface morphology (scanning electron microscopy), Fourier
transform infrared spectroscopy, and yields of terephthalic
acid (TPA) and mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid. Alkali
treatment produces the highest weight loss, while UVO pretreat-
ment moderately degrades textiles and significantly enhances
enzymatic TPA production. In contrast, prolonged sunlight expo-
sure has negligible effects.1H NMR analysis of supernatants con-
firms the formation of oxidized PET products following UVO
exposure, indicating surface chemical modifications that increase
enzymatic susceptibility. The results reveal differential effects on
PET and cotton fibers, highlighting UVO as a promising, selective
pretreatment for mixed textile waste. This study demonstrates
the potential of combining photochemical oxidation and enzy-
matic processes for targeted PET degradation, contributing to
more efficient textile recycling strategies.
1. Introduction
The amount of waste in the world is reaching alarming levels. In
Europe, the waste is estimated at around 6.95 tons annually.[1] The
fashion industry ranks fourth highest in environmental impact
(after food, housing, and mobility), significantly contributing to
climate change.[2] This negative impact stems from multiple
factors: First, textile production requires enormous water
resources— the water needed to produce a single cotton T-shirt
is equivalent to one person ’s drinking needs for 2.5 years.[3]
Second, textile dyeing and finishing processes contribute/C25 20%
of global water pollution. Third, the fashion industry accounts
for nearly 10% of global carbon emissions, exceeding the com-
bined impact of international flights and maritime shipping.[4]
Fourth, regular washing of synthetic and mixed-fiber clothing
significantly contributes to microplastic release into water systems
and ultimately oceans.[5] Finally, textile waste in landfills not only
takes centuries to decompose but also releases microplastics,
chemicals, and greenhouse gases throughout this process.[6]
To mitigate textile consumption ’s environmental impact,
improved reuse and recycling within a circular economy model
is essential. However, this remains largely aspirational— currently,
less than half of used clothing is collected for reuse, and only 1%
is recycled into new garments.[7] Existing recycling technologies,
including mechanical and chemical processes, are energy-
intensive and struggle with processing, separating, and recycling
mixed-fiber fabrics (blends of cotton, polyester, and nylon— the
archetypal synthetic textiles).[8]
Enzymatic approaches offer selectivity in breaking specific
chemical bonds, enabling targeted degradation, whereas purely
chemical treatments break down cotton/polyethylene tere-
phthalate (PET) sheets into monomers without selectivity. [9]
However, PET biodegradation requires enzyme access to hydro-
lyzable bonds. For instance, polymer crystallinity in postconsumer
PET bottles restricts enzyme access, necessitating pretreatment
to enhance PETase effectiveness in degrading crystalline PET.[10]
Similarly, pretreatment of synthetic textiles before enzymatic
processing enhances degradation kinetics [11–18] and provides
alternative strategies for textile recycling and product revaloriza-
tion. Various treatments have been investigated, including NaOH
at /C0 20 °C[12]; NaOH/urea solutions [13]; and mechanical mill-
ing[7,15,17] for mixed textiles, reporting degradation of wood
and cotton components, though not specifically addressing
PET (Table S1, Supporting Information).
Recent innovative research has explored natural agents to
facilitate controlled textile degradation for effective recycling.

These agents include sunlight UV component) and microorgan-
isms, pH modifiers present in the soil, and tropospheric ozone
(O3). For instance, tropospheric ozone forms when UV radiation
from the sun interacts with nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO2 þ NO)
and volatile organic compounds.[19]
In particular, the effects of UV and ozone on PET surface prop-
erties and crystallinity have been extensively studied (Table 1).
UV with ozone (UVO) treatment modifies PET surfaces by creating
polar groups during hydrolysis while causing minimal weight and
strength loss.
These reports suggest that UVO is not only effective but also a
dry, chemical-free, cost-efficient, and environmentally friendly
approach. In contrast, natural UV sunlight appears to have an
opposing effect, potentially hampering enzymatic activity.
In this study, we conducted a systematic investigation into
how various pretreatment methods enhance PETase-mediated
degradation of commercial cotton/PET textiles (65% PET/35%
cotton). We evaluated both wild-type (WT) PETase and its
enhanced S238F/W159H mutant (MUT) variant across multiple
degradation parameters, including textile weight loss and pro-
duction of key degradation products— terephthalic acid (TPA)
and mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET). Our com-
parative analysis examined three distinct pretreatment
approaches: alkaline conditions, controlled UVO exposure, and
natural sunlight exposure in Mediterranean coastal conditions
(Valencia/Castellon, Spain). Results revealed that while alkaline
pretreatment aggressively degraded the entire textile structure,
UVO pretreatment significantly amplified PETase enzymatic effi-
ciency without complete material destruction. Notably, extended
natural sunlight exposure produced negligible enhancement of
enzymatic degradation. These findings demonstrate that the stra-
tegic combination of UVO pretreatment with engineered PETase
enzymes represents a promising approach for developing tar-
geted, efficient textile recycling technologies to address the
growing global challenge of synthetic textile waste.
2. Results and Discussion
The study investigates the treatment of a polyester–cotton textile
with PETase enzyme following pretreatment, followed by analysis
using various techniques, including attenuated total reflection─
Fourier transform infrared (ATR─FTIR), scanning electron micros-
copy (SEM), and high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC), to assess the degradation of PET and cotton components
and evaluate the enzyme’s efficiency (Figure 1).
2.1. Weight Loss after Pretreatment and Enzymatic
Incubation
Previous studies have demonstrated that NaOH pretreatment of
postconsumer PET (e.g., plastic water bottles) significantly enhan-
ces biodegradation by PETase WT.[10] In this study, textiles were
incubated for 18 h at various NaOH concentrations. Low con-
centrations of NaOH (0.1 –1 M) resulted in textile weight loss
of /C25 2 /C6 1.45%, whereas 10 M NaOH induced a significant
48.52 /C6 0.70% weight loss (Figure 2A). In contrast, maximum

UVO exposure (18 h) resulted in an 8.03/C6 0.11% weight loss, sig-
nificantly higher than that observed with 30 or 5 min UVO expo-
sures. Importantly, enzyme incubation did not further increase
weight loss (Figure 2B), with values for WT and MUT PETase of
8.35 /C6 0.40% and 8.28 /C6 0.75%, respectively, comparable to
UVO exposure alone. This finding is consistent with previous
reports showing minimal weight loss after 15 min of UV treat-
ment.[11] Additionally, no significant impact on weight loss was
observed with temperature changes from 30 to 40 °C (Figure
S2, Supporting Information).
To explore more sustainable conditions that could facilitate
enzymatic degradation of textiles, we examined whether expo-
sure to natural environmental factors could enhance PETase
activity. For this, 65% PET/35% cotton textiles were exposed to
natural elements (sunlight, atmospheric ozone, and wind) for
1–12 weeks during the summer of 2023 in Castellon, Spain. No

significant differences in weight loss were observed when the
samples were exposed solely to sunlight for various durations
(1, 5, and 12 weeks), with a maximum weight loss of
3.11 /C6 0.38% (Figure 2C). Weight loss under these conditions
was not significantly influenced by enzymatic activity and did
not vary significantly between 2 and 12 weeks (Figure 2C).
Interestingly, short sun exposure (1 and 5 weeks) followed by
incubation with the MUT PETase enzyme resulted in reduced
weight loss, with values of 1.14 /C6 0.28% and 1.76 /C6 0.25%,
respectively (Figure 2C).
The maximum weight loss observed with NaOH treatment
can be attributed to both the strong chemical reaction and
the fact that it occurs in an aqueous solution, as opposed to other
pretreatments, which were conducted on dry textiles.
2.2. Selectivity of the Pretreatment
Since the textile is composed of both cotton and PET, it is crucial
to determine whether the pretreatment preferentially degrades
one component over the other. To address this, we examined the
textile after treatment and compared the ATR ─FTIR spectra
(Figure 3). The spectrum of the pristine, untreated textile is
shown in the top panel (red line), with pure cotton and PET spec-
tra provided in the supplementary materials (Figure S5,
Supporting Information). Characteristic peaks for each pure mate-
rial are marked with asterisks on the spectra.
No new bands were observed after the pretreatments, sug-
gesting that the reactions during the pretreatment and washing
steps lead to the solubilization of reaction products. This outcome
is not unexpected, as such reactions typically yield carboxylic
acids and salts, which are soluble in water.
The selectivity of degradation can be qualitatively assessed
by comparing the bands of the pure materials that are located
close in wavenumber. These bands can serve as internal
references, mitigating potential baseline correction effects.
Specifically, we analyzed the bands at 1080 and 1013 cm /C0 1,
which are characteristics of the ester group in PET (C═O) and
the hydroxyl group in cotton (C─O), respectively[20] (inset top
panel red line Figure 3).
Notably, NaOH 10M treatment (second panel, black line) pref-
erentially affects PET, as evidenced by a significant reduction in
the intensity of the 1080 cm/C0 1 band relative to the 1013 cm/C0 1
band (inset, second panel, Figure 3). This observation is in agree-
ment with the findings of Boondaeng et al.[20] indicating that the
NaOH treatment primarily targets the ester group of the PET poly-
mer, facilitating the breakdown of the PET chains more readily
than that of cotton.
UVO exposure for 18 h is a strongly oxidizing treatment that
results in a slight preferential reactivity toward cotton, as indi-
cated by the reduction in the cotton peak (inset, light green line,
third panel, Figure 3). Finally, exposure to natural sunlight for
12 days produces a degradation pattern similar to that of
Figure 3. ATR─FTIR spectra of mixed textile. Comparison of Cotton versus PET degradation under various treatment conditions.

NaOH treatment, suggesting a preferential degradation of PET. It
is important to note that preferential degradation does not imply
exclusive degradation.
2.3. Morphological Alterations of Mixed Textile under
Different Conditions
Next, we aimed to characterize morphologically the surface of the
PET/cotton textiles under the different treatments using SEM
(Figure 4). We observed that untreated polyester and cotton
fibers display a distinct appearance of a smooth surface
(Figure 4A), as shown by previous reports.[21,22] Incubation of
the textile with PETase WT for 2 week period has a slight effect
on the surface, with the presence of small scales at the edge of
the fibers, indicating the enzyme action on the polymer surface
(Figure 4B). Similar results have been reported for Lipase Cal A
incubation where PET fibers in pure PET textile reduced their
diameter after enzymatic action.[11]

Alkali treatment (10M NaOH, for 18 h) induces evident sur-
face alteration (Figure 4C), with distinct signs of erosion and
etching, characterized by clearly defined small pits distributed
at various intervals. Additionally, small deposits, absent in the
untreated fiber, are observed. The sample pretreated with
NaOH and incubated with the enzyme (Figure 4D) shows
no added morphological differences. Our results align with pre-
vious dates showing strong surface alterations after NaOH
exposure.[11]
UVO treatment (18 h) has a strong impact on cotton/polyester
textile surfaces. A uniformly roughened surface is observed on
the fibers, with visible thin filaments, apparently detached from
the uniform surface (Figure 4E). The combination of UVO pretreat-
ment with enzymatic degradation leads to much more severe
surface degradation, with less visible thin threads (Figure 4F).
UVO exposure showed evident cracks, suggesting that this treat-
ment goes deep into the fiber. This result agrees with previous
studies that have proposed the use of UV shields to prevent tex-
tile degradation.[23]
Finally, the samples exposed to sunlight for 12 weeks show a
considerable network of thin filaments (possibly cotton fibers)
that are more evident than in any other condition (Figure 4G).
This might be due to the preferential attack of PET fibers, as sug-
gested by FTIR. Similarly, to UVO exposure, PETase WT incubation
after sunlight exhibits less irregularities on the surface, and a
great reduction of threads compared to sunlight (Figure 4H).
Although it is unclear why the cotton threads disappear with
enzyme incubation in both cases (UVO and sunlight), we hypoth-
esized that this may be due to the contribution of PETase to the
detachment of cotton fibers.
2.4. Product Analysis after PETase Enzymatic Degradation
We aimed to analyze the monomer production under different
conditions, to understand whether enzymatic action can improve
textile recycling with targeted products, thus contributing to a
circular economy.
This was evaluated by HPCL quantification of degradations
products MHET and TPA. The yield was calculated with respect
to initial textile weight. In addition, different enzymatic incuba-
tion times were evaluated.
PET degradation products, TPA (Figure S1A, Supporting
Information), and MHET (Figure S1B, Supporting Information)
were evaluated after incubation with NaOH alone or followed
by enzymatic incubation. Maximum TPA yield was obtained
by NaOH alone and was not improved by enzyme treatment,
indicating that this severe treatment can degrade cotton and
PET fibers to monomer. However, NaOH treatment did not pro-
duce MHET, being this product only found with enzymatic activ-
ity mostly with PETase MUT activity (Figure S1B, Supporting
Information).
Enzyme incubation without pretreatment leads to TPA pro-
duction in a time-dependent manner with slight variations
depending on enzyme concentration (Figure 5, black triangles).
The impact of UVO pretreatment on PETase activity is shown
for TPA (Figure 5A) and MHET (Figure 5B). Only 18 h of UVO
exposure pretreatment has a notable impact on PETase activity.
After 2 weeks of enzyme incubation, TPA yield reached
0.43 /C6 0.06% for UVO þ PETase WT; a fourfold increase above
PETase WT alone (0.10 /C6 0.02%) (Green triangle Figure 5A).
Interestingly, at this incubation time, the plateau is not reached,

suggesting that the enzyme is still active and could increase
the yield with longer incubation.
MHET production, on the other hand, was minimal under
these conditions (Figure 5B), although surprisingly, 30 min expo-
sure to UVO improved it (but not TPA) (0.16/C6 0.01%), compared
to enzyme alone (0.03/C6 0.01%) (Figure 5B). These findings sug-
gest that varying durations of UVO exposure may result in dis-
tinct effects, while longer periods (18 h) promote TPA monomer
production, shorter intervals (30 min) favor MHET formation. The
molecular mechanism by which shorter exposure times result in
more favorable conditions for the breakdown of PET molecules
into MHET remains unknown. We argue that the difference
between UVO and natural conditions may rely on the different
intensity of UV. As mentioned above, one hour of laboratory
UVO conditions is more intense (over 4000x) than one hour
of sun in summer conditions.We argue that UVO-induced chem-
ical modifications improve enzyme accessibility to the hydrolys-
able bond. This was suggested by previous reports (Table 1),
where UVO was shown to induce benzene ring opening within
the PET molecular chains[24] and the introduction of hydroxyl
and carbonyl groups.[24,25] Additionally, UVO can alter the sur-
face properties of PET, making it more hydrophilic. [25–27]
Interestingly, the increased TPA production correlates with
our results that suggest a favored cotton degradation (mea-
sured by FTIR) and increased roughness of the PET surface
(SEM), both of which would facilitate PETase accessibility to
the hydrolysable bonds of PET.
To explore sustainable conditions that would facilitate the
enzymatic degradation of textiles, we analyzed TPA and MHET
after exposing the mixed fibers textiles to natural elements fol-
lowed by a 2 week enzyme incubation (Figure 5C,D). Twelve
weeks of exposure to the sun did not result in TPA production
(orange circles Figure 5C,/C25 0.005%). Furthermore, it did not sig-
nificantly favor PETase activity, obtaining 0.12/C6 0.02% TPA pro-
duction (orange triangle Figure 5C), whereas 2 week incubation
PETase WT alone resulted in a TPA yield of 0.10/C6 0.02% alone
(black triangle Figure 5C).
Concerning MHET, 2 week incubation with WT PETase alone
gave a very low yield (0.03/C6 0.01%) (Figure 5D), slightly incre-
mented by 1 (0.07 /C6 0 . 0 1 % ,p u r p l et r i a n g l eF i g u r e5 D )a n d5
weeks (0.06 /C6 0.007%, pink triangle Figure 5D) of environmen-
tal conditions exposure. Remarkably, 12 week exposure did
not increase PETase WT MHET yield (0,04 /C6 0,003%, orange
triangle Figure 5D).
Taking together, these results indicate that environmental
exposure has little or no effect on WT PETase activity. Whether
much longer time of exposure will have a bigger impact is likely,
but it remains to be determined. The intriguing result of the
increase of MHET yield at lower sun exposure times, similar to
the case with UVO pretreatment, suggests that pretreatments
may modulate enzyme activity.
2.5. Effect of Pretreatment on the Activity of Both PETase
Enzymes in Textile Degradation
We next aimed to compare PETase WT and PETase MUT effec-
tivity after the maximum effect conditions UVO (18 h) and
natural conditions (12 weeks) in TPA ( Figure 6A) and MHET
(Figure 6B) yield.
TPA yield from PETase activity with no pretreatment was sim-
ilar for PETase WT (0.10/C6 0.02%) and PETase MUT (0.13/C6 0.02%)
(gray columns in Figure 6A). Without enzyme, UVO 18 h had a
noticeable TPA (0.183 /C6 0.06%) (green column Figure 6A)
whereas environmental conditions did not (orange column
Figure 6A). A slight but synergistic effect was found combining
UVO 18 h with PETase incubation, increasing by almost twofold
PETase WT (0.43/C6 0.06%) and PETase MUT (0.37/C6 0.04%) TPA
yield (green columns in Figure 6A).
In contrast, environmental conditions did not have any effect
on PETase WT activity but intriguingly decreased PETase MUT
activity from 0.13/C6 0.02% to 0.05/C6 0.01% of TPA yield (orange
columns Figure 6A). This result would agree with Falkenstein
et al.[28] study (Table 1), where exposing PET film amorphous
(powder) to UV radiation prior to enzymatic incubation hindered
enzymatic activity. NMR techniques studies of chain dynamics
revealed an increase in the rigidity of UV-treated polymer chains,
which was associated with an intensification of surface PET crys-
tallinity and thereby reducing the accessibility for enzymatic
hydrolysis.[28] However, in our study this reduction is only evident
with PETase MUT, but not PETase WT, and the mechanism under-
lying this difference remains elusive.
Concerning MHET, the highe st yield was observed with
PETase MUT alone (0.08 /C6 0.004%), a 2,5-fold higher than
PETase WT (0.03 /C6 0.01%, gray columns Figure 6B). MHET

production by MUT was significantly reduced by 12 week sun
exposure (0.04 /C6 0.007%) and did not affect PETase WT (orange
columns Figure 6B). Interestingly, shorter environmental expo-
sure time (1 week) increased MHET yield in short, but not long
PETase MUT enzyme incubation, (4 days) (0.09 /C6 0.007%)
(Figure S4, Supporting Information). On the other hand, UVO
induces a minimal amount of MHET, and this is not affected
by PETase incubation (green co lumns Figure 6B). However,
shorter intervals (30 min) also favor MHET formation by
PETase MUT (Figure S4, Support ing Information). This result
agrees with the observed with NaOH pretreatment (Figure S1,
Supporting Information), indicating that PETase S238F/
W159H mutation favors the production of MHET. PETase
WT-dependent production of MHET was not affected by any
pretreatment.
Taking together these results, although the mechanism is
unknown, the aggressive pretreatment of UVO 18 h seems to
direct enzymatic activity to TPA production. When comparing
TPA production with other studies reporting textile enzyme deg-
radations, the yield is very low (Table 2). This is due to the aggres-
sive nature of the pretreatment used such as high pressure and
high temperature[16] or milling.[17] These treatments may be effec-
tive; however, they are energetically costly. The research of cost-
effective treatments is warranted.
To better understand the differential effect between natural
sun and UVO, it is important to note that 1 h of UVO radiation has
an intensity of 1152/C2 103 Wm /C0 2, whereas a full day of summer
sunlight has an intensity of 6408 W m/C0 2. Consequently, 1 h of
UVO exposure is equivalent to 6 months of summer UV sunlight
exposure (which we do not get in latitudes far from the Ecuador
as sun intensity varies with seasons).
2.6. Alkaline and Photooxidative Treatments Induce
Molecular and Structural Changes
To gain deeper insight into the molecular changes occurring dur-
ing UVO-induced PET degradation, we analyzed the1H NMR spec-
trum of the supernatant obtained from PET/cotton textiles
exposed to NaOH and UVO radiation (Figure S6, Supporting
Information). The results confirm distinct structural modifications
associated with each pretreatment (Figure 7).
Sodium hydroxide promotes the alkaline hydrolysis of PET
through cleavage of ester bonds, leading to the formation of
TPA and EG. This process enables PET to be chemically recycled
into its monomers, which can be purified and reused in the pro-
duction of new plastic materials.[29] The absence of other signals
indicates that, under the treatment conditions (10 M NaOH at
30 °C), no cellulose degradati on products from cotton were
generated in concentrations detectable by this technique, sug-
gesting minimal degradation o f the cotton component. This
result is consistent with the data obtained from infrared (IR)
spectroscopy.
In contrast, UVO exposure leads to photo-oxidative degrada-
tion of PET, resulting in polymer chain scission, which reduces
crystallinity and creates more enzyme-accessible regions and
the formation of various oxygen-containing functional groups,[30]
including carboxyl, hydroxyl, and carbonyl moieties[28,31] on the
surface of PET. These modifications increase the hydrophilicity
of PET, making it more accessible to PETase. This preconditioning

Also, UVO irradiation can induce cleavage of glycosidic bonds
and oxidation of hydroxyl groups in cellulose from cotton, gen-
erating low molecular weight compounds.[32]
Our 1H NMR analysis of supernatants from UVO-treated
PET/cotton composites conf irmed the formation of low-
molecular-weight degradation products originating from both
polymers.
Although no distinct signals were observed in the aldehyde
region, a small peak atδ 8.2 ppm suggests the presence of for-
mate or possibly overlaps with TPA signals. Additional resonances
at δ 2.1 ppm may correspond to the methyl group of acetic acid,
although contributions from PET degradation products cannot be
excluded. Peaks atδ 3.5–4.0 ppm may indicate the presence of
ethylene glycol (EG) or hydroxylated degradation products from
cellulose, though signal overlap with the buffer complicates pre-
cise interpretation. In the broader region ofδ 6.0–8.0 ppm, signals
likely arise from compounds derived from both PET and cotton,
including sugar-derived species such as hydroxymethylfurfural,
with a notable resonance atδ 6.7 ppm observed exclusively in
UV-treated samples.
For PET specifically, the spectrum exhibits shifts at
δ 7.8–8.1 ppm consistent with oxidation of the aromatic ring
and the formation of carboxylic acid groups. Additional signals
at δ 4.3–4.5 ppm indicate polymer chain scission and a reduction
in intact ester linkages. Resonances atδ 3.7 ppm further support
the release of free EG, a known product of PET backbone frag-
mentation. Broad signals in the aliphatic region (δ 1.2–2.0 ppm)
are attributed to low-molecular-weight degradation products or
partially oxidized intermediates.
These findings demonstrate that UVO treatment effectively
induces photooxidative degradation in both PET and cellulose
components, resulting in the release of low-molecular-weight
compounds detectable by NMR. The structural alterations caused
by UVO treatment suggest significant molecular degradation,
which may enhance the susceptibility of PET to subsequent enzy-
matic breakdown.
3. Conclusions
Our study demonstrates the critical importance of effective pre-
treatment methodologies for enhancing the enzymatic degrada-
tion of PET in complex textile matrices. We systematically
compared UVO exposure, alkali treatment, and natural sunlight
conditions, revealing significant differences betweentheir mech-
anisms and efficacy. We concluded that UVO pretreatment
enhances selective biodegradation of mixed textiles.
Alkali treatment (NaOH) degraded PET and cotton components
nonspecifically, causing substantial weight loss without enhancing
enzymatic selectivity. Although NaOH effectively depolymerizes
PET and partially degrades cellulose under harsh conditions, the
moderate temperature parameters used in this study (30 °C) lim-
ited the extent of degradation for both polymers, preserving textile
integrity while still allowing some chemical modification.
Figure 7. Mechanism of PET/cotton textile degradation. The textile was exposed to various pretreatment conditions, resulting in visible alterations on the
PET surface. NaOH pretreatment directly induces PET hydrolysis into simple monomers TPA and EG, which remain unaffected by subsequent PETase appli-
cation. In contrast, PETase alone acts on intact PET, generating intermediates such as MHET. UVO and UV pretreatments modify the PET structure to gener-
ate intermediate products that remain susceptible to further enzymatic degradation by PETase. Cotton components undergo minimal degradation under
these conditions.

Laboratory UVO treatment induced nonspecific weight reduc-
tion but demonstrated synergistic effects with subsequent
PETase activity. Notably, UVO exposure duration significantly
influenced degradation product profiles, with extended treat-
ment (18 h) favoring complete depolymerization to TPA, while
shorter exposure (30 min) yielded primarily MHET. This time-
dependent product selectivity represents a significant advance
in controlling PET degradation pathways.
Our (NMR) nuclear magnetic resonance data suggest that the
combined action of UV light and ozone greatly improve enzyme
accessibility and activity by: 1) generation of oxygen-containing
functional groups, increasing the surface hydrophilicity of the
polymer; 2) structural changes within the polymer matrix, i.e.,
cleavage of ester bonds, leading to partial depolymerization that
yield smaller fragments, and 3) reduced PET crystallinity by pro-
moting chain scission and increasing molecular disorder.
Natural environmental conditions (sunlight UV, atmospheric
ozone, precipitation) applied for up to 12 weeks showed minimal
enhancement of WT PETase activity and slight inhibition of MUT
PETase variants, despite inducing visible morphological altera-
tions. FTIR analysis indicated that solar exposure may preferen-
tially affect cotton rather than PET components, suggesting
material-specific photodegradation mechanisms that must be
considered in environmental fate models. We argue that the dif-
ference between UVO and natural conditions may rely on the dif-
ferent intensity of UV. As mentioned above, one hour of
laboratory UVO conditions is more intense (over 4000x) than
one hour of sun in summer conditions has an intensity of
1152 /C2 103 W m/C0 2, whereas a full day of summer sunlight in
Castellon area has a mean intensity of 6408 W m/C0 2.
WT and MUT PETase enzymes produced distinctly different
degradation product profiles, highlighting the potential for
designing enzymes with tailored activities for specific recycling
applications— a crucial consideration for developing circular
economy solutions for textile waste.
UVO pretreatment shows the most promise for enhancing
PETase-mediated degradation of PET in textile materials. This find-
ing has significant implications for developing scalable, energy-
efficient recycling technologies. Further research is needed to
elucidate the precise mechanisms of bond alterations and develop
optimized strategies using UVO or extended sunlight exposure as
cost-effective pretreatment approaches for textile recycling.
This study presents one of the first comprehensive and sys-
tematic comparisons of UVO exposure, alkali treatment, and
natural sunlight for enhancing PETase activity in textile biodeg-
radation. Notably, the inclusion of UVO pretreatment as a central
variable is particularly novel, as prior work has largely focused
on chemical or thermal strategies, with limited attention to
advanced photochemical oxidation techniques.
A key strength of this work lies in its detailed mechanistic
analysis of UVO-induced modifications to PET textiles at both
the chemical and structural levels. By examining changes in sur-
face functionalization, hydrophilicity, and crystallinity — critical
factors governing enzymatic accessibility and activity— the study
offers valuable insights into why UVO pretreatment outperforms
conventional approaches, providing a foundation for rational pro-
cess optimization.
Importantly, the use of real-world textile samples, as opposed
to model PET powders or films, enhances the practical relevance
of the findings. This choice addresses the additional challenges
posed by the heterogeneous composition and structure of com-
mercial textile waste, making the results more applicable to real
recycling scenarios.
Furthermore, the study highlights the synergistic effect of UV
light and ozone in promoting PET breakdown— a combination
that remains largely underexplored in the context of enzymatic
recycling. This synergy opens new perspectives for the develop-
ment of integrated UVO–enzyme treatment strategies that could
significantly improve the efficiency of plastic waste processing
and contribute meaningfully to addressing the global plastic
pollution crisis.

study are provided in the Supporting Information Appendix:
Experimental Details.
Enzyme Expression and Purification
Both PETases (WT and MUT) were expressed in a heterologous system
using Escherichia coli cells and purified following the protocol
described by Giraldo-Narcizo et al. [10]The enzyme concentrations
were determined using a Nanodrop Spectrophotometer.
NaOH Pretreatment of PET-Cotton Textile
Textile samples were immersed in NaOH solutions (0.1, 1, and 10M)
for 24 h at 30 °C under agitation.
UVO Pretreatment
A UVO Cleaner (Model No. 42-220, Jelight Company, Inc.) emitting
light at 253.7 nm with an irradiation power of 28–32 mW cm-2 was
used to irradiate textile pieces ( /C25 15 mg). Scoured samples were
exposed for 5 or 30 min on both sides and for 18 h under an excimer
lamp, maintaining a distance of 5 mm.
UV Sunlight Pretreatment
Textile pieces were exposed to natural atmospheric conditions for up
to 3 summer months in the Castellon area, Spain.
Enzymatic Degradation of PET
Untreated and pretreated textile pieces were incubated in 1 mL
glycine-NaOH buffer (50 mM, pH 9.0) containing purified enzymes
(2 mg enzyme/g PET) at either 30 or 40 °C for 1–14 days.
Analysis
After incubation, textile pieces were rinsed with distilled water and
vacuum-dried for 20 h at 40 °C. Weight loss was measured, and sam-
ples were analyzed by ATR─FTIR and SEM. The supernatant was cen-
trifuged, filtered, and analyzed by HPLC to quantify PET degradation
products. The yields of MHET and TPA were expressed as percentages
at different incubation times. Proton nuclear magnetic resonance
