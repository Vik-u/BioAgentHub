ABSTRACT
In this study, we presentMethylobacterium aquaticumA1, a novel strain capable of degrading polyester polyurethane (PE‐PUR).
The attachment of M. aquaticum A1 to PE‐PUR and its degradation capabilities were verified using Scanning Electron
Microscopy (SEM) and Fourier‐Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FT‐IR). Analysis of the reference genome ofM. aquaticum
revealed genes encoding enzymes with potential PE‐PUR degrading activity, including esterases, lipase, proteases and amidase
such as tesA, pgpB, aes, aprE, lon, degQ, and gatA. An esterase activity assay usingp‐nitrophenyl acetate (p‐NPA) showed
increased ester bond‐cleaving activity whenM. aquaticumA1 was exposed to polyurethane diol (PU‐diol), suggesting inducible
enzymatic activity involved in PE‐PUR degradation. These findings highlight the potential ofM. aquaticumA1 as a promising
biocatalyst for PE‐PUR degradation.
1 | Introduction
Plastics are widely used due to their high plasticity, light weight,
durability [1, 2]. Over the decades, their convenience and afford-
ability have resulted in a substantial global increase in plastic con-
sumption. From 1950 to 2015, approximately 8300 million tons of
plastic materials were produced worldwide [3]. As a result, plastic
waste also increased dramatically, accumulating to 6300 million
tons [3, 4]. When the discarded plastic waste is exposed to UV
radiation, high temperatures, wind, and other environmental
stresses, it undergoes photodegradation, weathering, or fragmenta-
tion into smaller particles. Thesechemically degraded or physically
fragmented plastics are categorized by size, with particles larger
than 5 mm referred to as macroplastics, those smaller than 5 mm as
microplastics, and those less than 0.1μma sn a n o p l a s t i c s[5–9].
Microplastics and nanoplastics have raised significant concerns re-
garding potential healthrisks, including oxidative stress, genotoxi-
c i t y ,a p o p t o s i s ,n e c r o s i s ,a n di n f l a m m a t i o n[10–12]. These plastic
particles can enter the bloodstream through dietary intake of con-
taminated food or inhalation of airborne plastics [13–16]. Both
microplastics and nanoplastics are persistent in the body due to
their resistance to degradation. Over time, their accumulation in the
bloodstream and vital organs, such as the brain, digestive system,
kidney and liver, could potentially lead to long‐term health
problems [11, 17–19]. However, effective methods for the safe
management of the vast amounts ofdiscarded plastics and their
derivatives remain underdeveloped and present significant
challenges [20–22].

Since the advent of plastic, the primary methods for managing
plastic waste were landfilling and incineration, with the
majority of plastic waste being buried in landfills and only 12%
incinerated [4]. However, landfills pose significant risks of soil
and groundwater contamination, while incineration generates
ash and gaseous toxic chemicals that contribute to both en-
vironmental and human health risks [20, 23, 24]. To promote a
sustainable environment, plastic recycling is indispensable [25].
Currently, mechanical and chemical methods are the primary
approaches used for plastic recycling, each with distinct ad-
vantages and disadvantages [ 21, 26 ]. Mechanical recycling
methods are advantageous due to their energy efficiency, rela-
tively low cost, and straightforward processes, which include
collection, identification, sorting, grinding, washing, agglomer-
ating, and compounding. Most commercially used recyclates
are produced through mechanical recycling [ 27]. However,
a significant drawback is that mechanical recycling
heavily depends on the quality of the plastic waste that is being
recycled [23, 27, 28]. Chemical recycling, including thermolysis
and solvolysis, can produce high‐quality plastics suitable for
medical applications, but it is generally more costly and
involves complex processes to obtain the final products [23, 29].
Although plastic recycling will play an essential role in a sus-
tainable future, the plastic waste problem is a complex issue
that cannot be addressed through recycling alone [30, 31]. Due
to technical limitations in sorting plastic waste and removing
contaminants, a significant portion of plastics currently remains
unrecycled, ultimately ending up in landfills or being inciner-
ated. Therefore, biodegradable plastics capable of degrading at
ambient temperatures are being actively researched as com-
plementary solutions to current recycling methods [ 32–35].
Additionally, microbial degradation of conventional plastics is
being explored as another approach to complement plastic re-
cycling [36]. The most significant potential of microbial plastic
degradation lies in its ability to break down microplastics
[37–39]. Recent studies are investigating the use of bioreactors
for degrading microplastics in wastewater by utilizing specific
strains of bacteria, fungi, and purified plastic‐degrading en-
zymes, such as PETases, cutinases and lipases [40–43]. Micro-
bial biodegradation offers a promising solution for addressing
marine and terrestrial microplastic pollution, as conventional
methods—such as landfilling, incineration, and recycling—are
ineffective at removing widely dispersed microplastics [ 44].
However, its commercial viability is currently limited by factors
such as low degradation efficiency and the need to account for
variables including the biochemical composition of the plastic,
temperature, pH, oxygen availability, potential pathogenic risks,
and overall environmental safety [23, 45, 46]. So far, a few
isolated microorganisms have successfully degraded poly-
ethylene terephthalate (PET) and blended textiles [47, 48], and
ongoing research is expanding to target other plastic types.
Polyurethane (PU), for example, is a versatile polymer ex-
tensively used in industries such as construction, automotive,
and textiles [49, 50]. PU comes in various forms depending on
the type of polyol and isocyanate used in its production, with
the isocyanate acting as a“glue” that links the polyols together
[51–53]. The most common types of PU are PE‐PUR (polyester
polyurethane) and PEE‐PUR (polyether polyurethane) [54]. The
accumulation of PU waste poses a significant environmental
challenge, as its extremely slow biodegradation rate leads to
prolonged persistence in the environment [55, 56]. To address
this issue, there is a growing interest in exploring microbial
degradation as a potential solution for PU waste management
[56
–58]. Currently, only PE‐PUR is known to be biodegradable
through the action of bacteria or fungi [59]. PEE‐PUR is re-
ported to be resistant to biodegradation due to the ether bonds
of polyols [60, 61]. It is known that the biodegradation of PE‐
PUR involves several enzymes, including esterases, urethanase,
amidase, cutinase, protease, lipase, and urease [62–66]. Bacteria
involved in the biodegradation of PE‐PUR include Bacillus pu-
milus NMSN‐1d, Acinetobacter gerneri P7, Comamonas acid-
ovorans TB‐35, Pseudomonas fluorescens , Pseudomonas
chlororaphis [67–71]. Upon the degradation of PE‐PUR, die-
thylene glycol and adipic acid are generated [72, 73].
This study aimed to isolate and characterize novel micro-
organisms capable of degrading polyester polyurethane (PE‐
PUR), which is known for its high mechanical strength and
chemical resistance [74, 75]. By cultivating microorganisms in a
minimal salts medium with PE‐PUR as the sole carbon source,
we identified a novel Methylobacterium strain capable of
adhering to and degrading PE‐PUR. This strain contains several
enzyme candidates—tesA, pgpB, aes, aprE, lon, degQ, and
gatA—that are potentially involved in the degradation process.
Note that all PU samples used in this study are specifically
PE‐PUR; from this point onward, we refer to PE‐PUR simply as PU.
2 | Materials and Methods
2.1 | Plastic Film Preparation
PE‐PUR films were purchased from Kimyung TPU Co. Ltd, and
commercial PET films were purchased from a local market in
Pohang. PE‐PUR and PET films were cut into 1 × 1 cm
2 or 2 × 2
cm2 and prepared through several steps of sterilization. Incu-
bate plastic films in a solution of 1% (v/v) bleach and 0.7% (v/v)
Tween 80 at 30°C for an hour, followed by washing with 70%
ethyl alcohol (EtOH) for 30 min. Finally, it was washed with
30% hydrogen peroxide (H
2O2) for 1 min, rinsed with distilled
water (DW), and dried overnight on a clean bench.
2.2 | Isolation, Identification, and Culturing of
Bacteria
Bacteria were isolated from soil samples collected at
Yunghapgisul‐ro, Heunghae‐eup, Buk‐gu, Pohang‐si, Republic
of Korea and resuspended in minimal salts medium (MSM)
containing 2.27 g K
2HPO4; 0.95 g KH2PO4; 0.67 g (NH4)2SO4;
2 mL metals (6.37 g Na2EDTA.2H2O; 1 g ZnSO4.7H2O; 0.5 g
CaCl2.2H2O; 2.5 g FeSO4.7H2O; 0.1 g NaMoO4.2H2O; 0.1 g Cu-
SO4.5H2O; 0.2 g CoCl 2.6H2O; 0.52 g MnSO 4.H2O; 60 g
MgSO4.7H2O); per liter of distilled water (DW) and incubated
with sterilized PU or PET film in a rotary shaker incubator for
2 weeks at 30°C, 140 rpm for enrichment. Single‐colony bacteria
were isolated using the streaking method if biofilms were
formed on the sterilized films. After identification,M. aqua-
ticum A1 culture was done in R2A medium (Kisan Bio®)
2o f1 2 Journal of Basic Microbiology, 2025
containing 0.5 g casamino acid hydrolysate; 0.5 g yeast extract;
0.5 g proteose peptone; 0.5 g dextrose; 0.5 g soluble starch; 0.3 g
dipotassium phosphate; 0.05 g magnesium sulfate; 0.3 g sodium
pyruvate; per liter of DW or MSM, MSM + yeast extract 0.01%.
For bacterial identification, 16S rRNA sequencing with BLAST
was conducted by Macrogen®.
2.3 | Phenotypic and Biochemical
Characterization of Bacterial Isolates
Phenotypic and biochemical characterization ofM. aquaticum
strain A1 was done using GEN III MicroplateTM (Biolog®). The
bacteria were streaked on R2A agar and incubated for 48 h at
33°C. Inoculate a single colony into the Inoculating fluid (IF‐C)
until the turbidity (T) reaches 65% cell density. Pipette 100μL
into each well of the GEN III microplate and then incubate for
24–48 h at 33°C. Absorption measurement was done at 590 nm
using a microplate reader (Hidex Sense) and each well was
compared quantitatively and visually with a control well.
2.4 | Plastic Film Degradation Using Isolated
Bacteria
PU and PET films were weighed using an analytical balance
(CPA224S, Sartorious, Germany) before incubation withM. aqua-
ticum A1. Films were incubated withM. aquaticumA1 at an initial
OD600 of 0.1 in MSM supplemented with 0.01% yeast extract in a
r o t a r ys h a k e ri n c u b a t o ra t3 0 ° C ,1 4 0 r p mf o r3 0d a y s .A f t e ri n c u -
bation films were washed with 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) for
4 h then washed three times using one‐tenth diluted methanol
solution (10:1, DW:methanol) [76], and dried overnight on a clean
bench. Dried films were reweighed and analyzed by SEM or FT‐IR.
2.5 | Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM)
For sample preparation, bacterial colonies grown on an R2A
agar plate were cut into blocks. The agar blocks were fixed and
dehydrated. First, fixation was done by submerging the blocks
in 2.5% glutaraldehyde in phosphate‐buffered saline (PBS) for
2 h, room temperature (RT) [77]. Then agar blocks were washed
two times with PBS. Samples were dehydrated by submerging
them sequentially in 30%, 50%, 70%, 80%, 95%, and 100% (vol/
vol) ethanol for 10 min each [77]. The last 100% ethanol dehy-
dration lasted for 30 min and dried overnight on a clean bench
at room temperature. Before SEM imaging, sputter coating with
platinum (Pt) was conducted. HITACHI S ‐4800 Scanning
Electron Microscope was operated at 15.0 kV for imaging.
2.6 | Fourier ‐Transform Infrared
Spectroscopy (FT‐IR)
Attenuated total reflectance (ATR) and transmittance were used to
detect functional groups of plastic films cultured withM. aquaticum
A1. The measurement range was 4000–400 cm−1. The Varian 670/
620 (Materials Characterization Lab., Unist) was used. The spectral
resolution was 0.075 cm

incubated with 20 mM Tris‐HCl pH 7.5 and 200μM p‐NPA (freshly
prepared in 5 mM stocks in ethanol) to a final volume of 200μLi n
UV‐cuvette [78]. Measurement was done at 405 nm at room tem-
perature using a UV‐spectrophotometer (Shimadzu, Japan) for
2 min. The extinction coefficient (ε410) of p‐NPA at pH 7.5 is
11.8 × 10
6 cm2/mol, and the optical path length is 1 cm [78].
One unit of esterase activity was defined as the amount of enzyme
required to release 1 µmol ofp‐nitrophenol per minute under the
assay conditions [79, 80].
2.8 | Identification of Candidate Genes Involved
in PU Degradation
To identify enzyme candidates capable of cleaving ester and
urethane bonds in PU, we first employed a keyword ‐based
search strategy using the following terms: esterase, urethanase,
amidase, cutinase, protease, urease and lipase to filter relevant
genes from the UniProt database. Candidates were then refined
based on the following criteria:
1. EC Number Association: Enzymes with EC numbers
linked to ester and urethane bond degradation (esterase:
EC 3.1; protease: EC 3.4; amidase: 3.5) were prioritized.
2. Gene Annotation: Candidates with experimentally vali-
dated gene annotations were selected to ensure reliability.
3. Motif matching: Candidates containing the following
motifs—hydrolase (GGGX), serine hydrolase (GXSXG),
and catalytic triads (Ser‐Asp‐His/Glu or Ser‐cisSer‐Lys)—
were selected for their potential roles in ester and ure-
thane bond cleavage. To evaluate catalytic triads as
structural motifs, AlphaFold3 predictions are employed.
In the reference genome ofMethylobacterium aquaticumMA‐22A,
the following candidate genes were identified as potential PU‐
degrading enzyme genes:tesA, pgpB, aes, aprE, lon, degQ,a n dgatA.

A bacterial strain was isolated from a minimal salts medium
(MSM) culture containing PU film during the screening

process. The colonies exhibited characteristic pink to red pig-
mentation. The cells are rod‐shaped, measuring 2.5–5 μmi n
length, and are classified as Gram‐negative (Figure 1A). The
strain was identified as M. aquaticum through 16S rRNA
sequencing exhibiting 99% sequence identity to known M.
aquaticum GR16 (GenBank Accession No. NR 025631.1) and
was designated as a novel strainM. aquaticum A1 (Figure 1B,
Table S1). Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that M. aqua-
ticum A1 exhibited a distinction from two otherM. aquaticum
species listed in the public database (Figure1B). Its phenotypic
and biochemical characteristics were analyzed using a GEN III

3.2 | M. aquaticumA1 Formed Biofilm on PU and
PET Films
Bacterial adherence is crucial for plastic degradation [82]. To
examine the attachment ofM. aquaticum A1 to PU film, the
strain was incubated for 7 days in MSM supplemented with
0.01% yeast extract and R2A media, respectively, along with PU
film. Visual inspection confirmed thatM. aquaticumA1 formed
biofilms on PU film in both MSM supplemented with 0.01%

yeast extract and R2A media (FigureS1A,B). The 0.01% yeast
extract added to MSM provides minimal nutrients to support
early biofilm formation by the inoculated microorganisms,
whereas R2A media supplied sufficient nutrients for overall
growth. Biofilms were formed in both media, but they were
thicker and more extensive when grown in R2A media. For
cellular‐level observation, the incubated PU film was washed,
fixed, dehydrated, and Pt‐coated for SEM analysis. SEM images
showed pili‐like structures for attachment and the localized
formation of substances, likely to be extracellular polymeric
substances between bacteria (Figure2A). These features were
not seen in SEM images of cultures grown on agar plates
(Figure 1A). Notably, a similar level of biofilm formation was
observed on PET film, another widely used synthetic polymer,
in R2A medium (Figure2B and FigureS1D). However, in MSM
with 0.01% yeast extract, visual inspection revealed reduced
biofilm formation on PET film compared to PU film
(Figure S1C), suggesting a tendency for biofilm formation on
various plastic surfaces rather than exclusively on PU, although
biofilm formation on PET film is less effective than on PU film
in the MSM‐based medium.
3.3 | The Surface Erosion of the PU Film byM.
aquaticum A1 Was Observed
To assess plastic degradation in regions with biofilm formation,
PU and PET films were incubated withM. aquaticum A1 for
30 days. Sterilized PU and PET films were incubated in MSM
supplemented with 0.01% yeast extract at 30°C.M. aquaticum
A1 was inoculated at an initial OD
600 of 0.1. After 30 days, the
films were washed with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and
methanol to remove bacterial cells, followed by SEM analysis.
Compared to the negative control (Figure3A), the PET film
incubated withM. aquaticumA1 for 30 days showed no signs of
erosion (Figure3C), despite biofilm formation. In contrast, clear
signs of erosion were observed on the surface of the PU film
(Figure 3B), confirming the ability of M. aquaticum A1 to
degrade PU. The dark areas in Figure3B represent recessed
regions.
3.4 | FT ‐IR Confirmed the PU Degradation byM.
aquaticum A1
In the PU polymer, the carbonyl (C = O) group is characteristic
of both ester bonds (‐R‐C( = O)‐O‐R’) and urethane linkages
(‐NH‐C( = O)‐O‐C‐)[ 83]. To assess whether the observed ero-
sion of the PU film was due to bacteria‐mediated hydrolysis of
ester bonds and/or urethane linkages, the chemical composition
of the PU film surface was analyzed using Fourier Transform
Infrared (FT‐IR) spectroscopy, which identifies chemical com-
pounds and elucidates molecular structures based on IR light
absorption [84, 85]. FT‐IR analysis showed a reduction in the
C = O stretching band for ester bonds at around 1730 cm
−1
(Figure 4B: Panel 3), along with a decrease in the peak corre-
sponding to C‐O stretching at 1222‐1076 cm−1 (Figure 4B: Panel
1–2), indicating the cleavage of ester bonds within the PU film
[86–88]. Additionally, the reduction in the peak at approxi-
mately 1704 cm−1 (Figure 4B: Panel 3), representing the C = O
stretching of urethane bonds [89], along with the appearance of
a new peak in the 3300–3500 cm−1 region (Figure 4C: Inset)
corresponding to free N ‐H stretching [ 90, 91 ], indicates
the formation of amine groups (‐NH2), a byproduct of urethane
bond (‐NH‐C( = O)‐O‐C‐) breakage [89, 90]. The presence of
the amine signal implies the possibility of urethane linkage
hydrolysis. In contrast, other functional group peaks unrelated
to ester bonds and urethane linkages showed no significant
changes (Figure 4A). These findings suggest that the observed
degradation was due to bacteria‐mediated cleavage of both ester
bonds and urethane linkages.
3.5 | Enhanced Ester Bond ‐Cleaving Activity of
M. aquaticum A1 in the Presence of PU
Esterase activity is an indicator of microbial ester bond cleavage
ability [79, 92]. To further confirm the involvement of enzyme‐
mediated ester bond hydrolysis in PU degradation, ester bond‐
cleaving activity was evaluated in M. aquaticum A1 and the
negative control,E. coliDH5α, both in the presence and absence
of PU‐diol (a soluble PU monomer).E. coliDH5α was used as a

aquaticum A1 in R2A media at 30°C. (A) PU film incubated withM. aquaticum A1 for 7 days. (B) PET film incubated withM. aquaticum A1 for

negative control due to its low esterase activity derived from
endogenous enzymes [ 93]. The activity was quantified by
measuring the production ofp‐nitrophenol, which absorbs light
at 410 nm [80, 92]. p‐Nitrophenol is formed as a byproduct
during the hydrolysis of ester bond‐containing p‐nitrophenyl
acetate (p‐NPA), a reaction catalyzed by esterases and other
ester bond‐cleaving enzymes [79]. When PU‐diol was added to
MSM, the ester bond‐cleaving activity of M. aquaticum A1
significantly increased compared to that without PU ‐diol
(Figure 5). In contrast, no significant difference in ester bond‐
cleaving activity was observed in theE. coli treatment groups,
suggesting thatM. aquaticumA1 enhances ester bond cleavage
enzyme activity during PU degradation under carbon source‐
limited conditions.
3.6 | Reference Genome of M. aquaticumEncodes
Potential Enzymes for Ester and Urethane Bond
Cleavage
We searched forM. aquaticum genes encoding enzymes likely
to catalyze PU degradation. Various bacterial enzymes,
including esterases, urethanase, amidase, cutinase, protease,
lipase, and urease have been proposed to cleave ester or ure-
thane bonds at different sites within PU [62–66]. Among these,
esterase and protease, and amidase are considered one of the
most promising candidates due to its demonstrated moderate
degradation efficiency in cleaving ester and urethane bonds,
respectively, in PU [70, 94]. Genomic analysis of the reference
strain Methylobacterium aquaticum MA‐22A revealed the

presence of esterase and lipase genes, includingtesA, pgpB, and
aes, each containing either a hydrolase motif (GGGX) or a
serine hydrolase motif (GXSXG) (FigureS2), both of which are
known for catalyzing ester bond hydrolysis [95]. Additionally,
the M. aquaticum reference genome contains protease genes
such as aprE, lon, and degQ, each featuring not only serine
hydrolase motifs but also a catalytic triad (Ser‐Asp‐His/Glu),
suggesting potential activity in both peptide bond and urethane
bond cleavage [70, 95–98]. Furthermore, an amidase gene was
identified with a highly conserved motif (GGSS) and a catalytic
triad (Ser‐cisSer‐Lys), which has recently been associated with
urethane bond cleavage [99].
4 | Discussion
The Methylobacteriumgenus are facultative methylotrophs, pri-
marily consuming methanol and other single‐carbon molecules
as a carbon source [100]. The discovery thatMethylobacterium
aquaticum A1 can degrade not only single‐carbon molecules but
also the synthetic carbon‐based polyester polyurethane highlights
the metabolic flexibility of methanotrophs. This finding suggests
that these organisms can adapt their pathways to break down
complex carbon‐based molecules when preferred single‐carbon
substrates, such as methane or methanol, are limited. Previous
studies have shown that certainMethylobacteriumspecies can
degrade complex organic compoundsunder specific conditions; for
instance,Methylocella silvestriscan oxidize both methane and multi‐
carbon compounds like propane and butane [101], whileMethylo-
cystis parvus has demonstrated potential to degrade poly-
hydroxybutyrate (PHB), a biodegradable plastic [102, 103 ].
However, the ability of methanotrophs to degrade PU polymers has
not been previously documented. This result expands our under-
standing of methanotroph ecology, suggesting that they may play a
broader role in carbon cycling than previously recognized.
Methylobacterium aquaticum is an ecologically beneficial bac-
terium commonly found in natural environments such as water,
soil, and plant surfaces [81, 104]. These bacteria colonize plant
surfaces, where they utilize methanol released during plant
growth, providing various benefits to the host plant. For ex-
ample, they produce hormones like auxin and cytokinin, which
promotes plant growth and strengthens root systems, and
accumulate β‐carotene within their cells, helping to mitigate
UV stress for both the bacteria and their host plants [105–112].
Additionally, M. aquaticum decomposes methane and
methanol in soil and aquatic environments, producing benefi-
cial byproducts and acting as a hidden regulator within eco-
systems [113, 114]. Methylobacterium aquaticum also exhibits
high survivability in diverse conditions due to its ability to
utilize various carbon sources, its high UV resistance, and its
moderate tolerance to temperature, pH, and desiccation [115].
Ecologically beneficial characteristics, combined with its high
survivability positions the PU ‐degrading methanotrophs as
potentially valuable agents for bioremediation, particularly in
the context of microplastic management.
While this study demonstrated that theM. aquaticum strain is
capable of degrading PU and investigated its potential degra-
dation mechanisms, several limitations remain. First, the
microbial PU degradation efficiency is relatively low. The slight
surface erosion observed under electron microscopy after
30 days of incubation indicates that enhancing this PU ‐
degrading capability is necessary for potential commercial ap-
plications. Future work could employ serial passage, also
known as adaptive evolution, by applying selective pressure in
media where PU is the primary carbon source while restricting
other major carbon sources, to obtainM. aquaticum variants
with improved PU degradation ability.
Secondly, while FT‐IR is highly effective for identifying chem-
ical changes and tracking specific functional groups, it has
limitations in providing quantitative data on the exact amounts
of by‐products formed during PU degradation, such as diethy-
lene glycol, butanediol, and trimethylolpropane from ester bond
cleavage [116, 117
], as well as polyols and amines from ure-
thane bond cleavage [118, 119]. To quantify these by‐products
and accurately determine the extent of PU degradation, tech-
niques such as gas chromatography –mass spectrometry
(GC–MS) or high ‐performance liquid chromatography –mass
spectrometry (HPLC‐MS) should be employed.
Lastly, although we identified a group of candidate enzymes—tesA,
pgpB, aes, aprE, lon, degQ,a n dgatA—potentially involved in ester
bond and urethane linkage hydrolysis in PU, we were unable
to pinpoint the specific enzymes directly responsible for PU
degradation. For example, while theaes gene contains the same
serine hydrolase motif as those found in known PU‐degrading
enzymes [95], this hypothesis requires empirical confirmation.
Substrate specificity depends on more than just the presence of
specific functional motifs. The precisely arranged active site archi-
tecture of the enzyme, along with its dynamics within the protein,
plays a crucial role in specifically binding and cleaving urethane
bonds [120]. To identify the PU‐degrading enzymes, specific en-
zyme inhibitors can be added to a minimal salts medium containing
Impranil® (a water‐dispersible PU substratewith urethane linkages).
By monitoring microbial growth under these conditions, specific
FIGURE 5 | Ester bond‐cleaving activity of M. aquaticum A1 was
assessed with and without PU‐diol. M. aquaticumA1 andE. coliDH5α
(negative control) were first cultured overnight in R2A and LB media,
respectively, and then inoculated into MSM or MSM + PU‐diol at an OD
of 0.1. The experiments were conducted in triplicate, with each divided
into two technical replicates for measurement (*p‐value < 0.05).
8o f1 2 Journal of Basic Microbiology, 2025
enzymes involved in PU degradationcan be identified. Additionally,
protein purification combined with mass spectrometry could be
employed to isolate and identify active enzymes that degrade PU
substrates such as Impranil®. Alternatively, targeted gene knockouts
using CRISPR‐Cas9 or its variants could systematically disable the
candidate enzymes, followed by assessments of their impact on PU
degradation.
In conclusion, we identified a novel Methylobacterium aqua-
ticum strain capable of degrading polyester polyurethane, as
confirmed by SEM and FT‐IR analysis. A notable increase in the
ester bond‐cleaving activity ofM. aquaticumA1 in the presence
of PU‐diol under carbon source ‐limited conditions suggests
inducible enzymatic activity, a molecular mechanism con-
tributing to polyester polyurethane degradation. Several ester-
ase, lipase, protease and amidase genes that may be involved in
breaking ester or urethane bonds were identified. This study
provides the first evidence of polyester polyurethane degrada-
tion by M. aquaticum.
