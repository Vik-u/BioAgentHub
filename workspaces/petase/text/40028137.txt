ABSTRACT: Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a widely used plastic, is a significant environmental pollutant due to its persistence.
While the PET-degrading enzyme PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis offers promising solutions, its limited activity at higher
temperatures hinders its practical application. This study aimed to enhance the PETase performance through protein engineering.
We introduced multiple amino acid substitutions to the wild-type I. sakaiensis PETase to improve its thermostability, substrate
binding, and catalytic activity. Several potential mutant IsPETases were generated using computational design and evaluated in silico.
The selected mutant was then produced in E. coli BL21(DE3). Finally, the catalytic activity of the purified mutant IsPETase was
examined in vitro using p-nitrophenyl butyrate and PET substrates. IsPETase
MT
has been confirmed to be catalytically active and
more thermostable with a maximum temperature reaching 60 °C and the T
m
value increasing up to 15.3 °C compared to the wild-
type PETase, IsPETase
WT
. IsPETase
MT
also showed better degradation toward the PET plastic film in comparison to IsPETase
WT
.
Thus, these findings demonstrate successful protein engineering to create a more robust PETase for potential plastic waste
management applications.
1. INTRODUCTION
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a reversible, reheatable,
and easily moldable thermoplastic. As a result, PET is the most
widely used thermoplastic polymer resin in the polyester
family, with consistently high demand from downstream users
annually.
1
The annual production of PET worldwide reached
30.5 million metric tons in 2019, and it is projected to increase
to approximately 35.3 million metric tons produced annually
by 2024 with continued growth anticipated each subsequent
year.
2
The higher the PET production is, the higher the waste
product will be in the environment. The highest waste
products were generated from the packaging industry to
which PET contributed 33 million metric tons or 27% of total
waste in 2015.
1
Meanwhile, its resistance characteristic makes
PET difficult to depolymerize and a potential danger to the
environment.
Recently, there have been three widely used ways of
managing plastic waste: chemically, mechanically, or bio-
logically. PET depolymerization by the chemical process
involved a variety of harsh chemicals and expensive costs.
3
Meanwhile, frequently, mechanically recycled PET produced
poor-quality products, and the process reduced the quality of
material properties.
1
Processing PET waste using thermal
combustion could result in the formation of toxic fumes, which
pollute the environment.
3
Alternatively, the biological PET
degradation method is environmentally friendly and effective.
Biodegradation studies generally use enzymes from microbes,
including cutinase, lipase, and esterase.
One of the enzymes that has demonstrated degradation
activity toward PET polymers is the leaf-branch compost
(LC)-cutinase from Clostridium thermocellum, which has an
activity to degrade more than 60% of a commercial PET film
after 14 days of incubation at 60 °C.
4
However, LC-cutinase
has a low binding affinity with PET
5
and needs the addition of
calcium ions to increase its melting temperature, which may
result in higher costs for industrial applications.
6
Another available option for PET degradation is the
application of PET hydrolase (PETase) and mono-(2-
hydroxyethyl)terephthalate hydrolase (MHETase). Synergisti-
cally, they completely degrade PET into CO
2
and water.

of them not only display high activity but are also applicable
under mild conditions. Thus, they could be a promising waste
management strategy for plastic waste and be applicable on an
industrial scale.
8,9
However, PETase has a heat-labile character and will be
inactivated at a temperature above 40 °C.
1
In moderate
temperatures around 25−30 °C, PETase could lose its
degradation activity after more than 1 day of incubation
time. This makes PETase less efficient for industrial
applications because PET processing requires a long
incubation time as well as a high reaction temperature of
around 50−65 °C to enhance the degradation rate. In addition,
the long polymer chain surface transition requires a temper-
ature close to the transition temperature in glass (T
g
= 65
°C).
10−12
Some modified PETases have recently been developed to
enhance their thermostability, including FAST-PETase (T
m
=
63.3),
13
HotPETase (T
m
= 80.5),
13
TurboPETase (T
m
=
84),
14
and DuraPETase (T
m
= 52).
15,16
However, since none
of them have been applied in the industry yet, intensive
research and developments are still needed to provide PETases
with improved stability and hydrolysis activity as alternative
solutions for PET plastic waste processing.
17
As previously reported in some studies, introducing several
point mutations to I. sakaiensis PETase potentially increases its
thermostability, while other point mutations improve its
affinity to substrates.
18
In this study, we generated a modified
PETase by introducing a combination of several point
mutations to I. sakaiensis PETase to improve not only its
thermostability but also its affinity to the substrate. The
performances of the modified PETase were predicted through
molecular docking and molecular dynamic simulations.
Furthermore, we successfully expressed modified PETase in
the E. coli BL21(DE3) system and evaluated its thermostability
and catalytic activity in PET degradation.
2. METHODS
Stability Screening and Mutation Analysis. The 3D
crystal structure of PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis was
retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (www.pdb.org/
pdb) (PDB ID: 6EQE). This model was chosen because of the
high resolution (Å ≤ 2) and percentile quality rating that
conforms to protein quality standards (blue region).
The stability mutation screening was provided using the
FoldX for YASARA software to achieve mutation points that
play a role in improving protein stability, as it can also assist in
performing protein repair, executing amino acid mutations, and
determining Gibbs’s free energy (ΔG) values. The three single
mutants, which showed the highest value of stability, were
combined in the next mutation and called “Stable mutant”.
Furthermore, the screening process of the mutants intended
for ligand-to-ligand interaction and thermal stability was
analyzed in the molecular dynamics step. The three single
mutants that had the lowest docking score were combined with
the stable mutant to obtain a combined mutant that had high
stability and a strong interaction with ligands.
Molecular Dynamics (MD) Analysis. MD simulation was
performed to evaluate the thermal stability of mutant and wild-
type PETase. IsPETase
MT
and IsPETase
WT
structures were
protonated at pH 7 using the PlayMolecule Web server
(www.playmolecule.com). The system was then solvated with
TIP3P water, and Na+ and Cl
−
were used to neutralize the
system. The CHARMM36 force field was applied to the
system.
19
Minimization was done with the steepest descent
algorithm and equilibrated with NVT ensemble for 500 ps
followed by NPT ensemble for 500 ps with a cutoff 10 Å and a
time step of 2 fs. Production dynamics was done at 300, 400,
and 450 K. Thermostability was evaluated by rge root mean
square deviation (RMSD), root mean square fluctuation
(RMSF), and trajectory analysis using VMD 1.9.3.
IsPETase
MT
interaction with the substrate was then analyzed
with docking simulations. The location of the ligand binding
site pocket of the protein was analyzed using the POCASA
(Pocket-Cavity Search) 1.1 server. The substrates' 3D
conformation was generated using Marvin Sketch 18.28,
while the torsion was checked by AutoDock Tools 1.5.6.
20
IsPETaseMT’s interaction with its substrate was investigated
through molecular docking using AutoDock Vina.
21
The
docking score, expressed as affinity, indicated the strength of
this interaction. Visualization using LigPlot, Chimera, and
BIOVIA Discovery Studio 2020 revealed hydrophobic
interactions and hydrogen bonds between IsPETaseMT and
the substrate.
22−24
To further refine the docking score,
MMPBSA simulation was conducted at 300 K, employing
the same molecular dynamics (MD) protocol. Gibbs free
energy of binding between the substrates and the PETase
mutant was then calculated using 500 frames from the MD
simulation.
Potential Electrostatic Visualization. The effect of
mutations on the protein surface characteristics was analyzed
by comparing the electrostatic potential of mutants to the wild
type using the APBS method. The APBS calculations were
performed using the AutoDock Tools version 1.5.6 software.
Subsequently, the data were visualized in three dimensions
using Chimera.
Expression of PETase. The optimized codon wild-type
and mutant PETase genes were synthesized
23
and subcloned
into the pET-22b(+) vector between BamHI and HindIII
restriction sites by GenScript. Before expression, colonies were
confirmed through colony PCR, plasmid isolation, and DNA
sequencing. The optimum expression conditions of recombi-
nant protein were determined using varying concentrations of
IPTG (0, 0.25, 0.5, and 1 mM), temperatures (24 and 37 °C),
and induction durations (8, 16, and 24 h). The recombinant
protein expression subsequently was analyzed using the SDS-
PAGE method (Bio-Rad), and the bands formed on the gel
were further analyzed using ImageJ to determine the
percentage of protein concentration.
Enzyme Purification and Confirmation. The purifica-
tion system was carried out using a Ni-NTA affinity
chromatography column (Thermofisher). The expression
supernatant (concentrated 20×) was added with an equilibra-
tion buffer (1:1) to the purification column. Subsequently,
samples were dialyzed against PBS using Amicon Ultra-15 10
kDa at 4 °C. The purified enzymes were used in SDS-PAGE,
Western blot, and catalytic assay.
To confirm the presence of the protein, a Western blot
analysis was conducted. Initially, the purified PETase (±0.5
mg/mL) was transferred onto a PVDF membrane (Thermo
Fisher Scientific) using the eBlot L1 Protein Transfer System
(GenScript Inc.). The blots were then blocked with 1% skim
milk in TBS-T (pH 7.2). Detection involved the use of anti-
His tag mouse IgG and horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-
conjugated goat antimouse IgG. The Western blot analysis
was carried out using a colorimetric method with luminol (LI-

6386
COR), and the results were read using the C-Digit Blot
Scanner (LI-COR).
Catalytic and Thermostability Assay. The catalytic and
thermostability assays for PETase were conducted using p-
nitrophenyl butyrate (Sigma-Aldrich) and SYPRO Orange dye
(Sigma-Aldrich). For these assays, 1 mM p-nitrophenyl
butyrate in 50 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) was utilized
to test the activity and thermostability of PETase. Each sample
was incubated for 10 min at 24 (room temperature), 30, 40,
50, 60, and 70 °C. The release of p-nitrophenol (pNP) was
monitored at 415 nm using a GloMax Microplate Reader
(Promega). Purified PETase diluted in PBS served as the
negative control. The concentration of the purified protein was
first determined using a NanoDrop UV/vis Spectrophotometer
(Thermo Fisher Scientific).
Thermostability analysis of PETase was performed to
determine the melting temperatures (T
m
's) using differential
scanning fluorimetry (DSF). Purified PETase of 47.5 μL (0.5
mg/mL, in PBS solution, pH 7.4) was prepared, and 2.5 μL of
50× SYPRO orange solution in ddH
2
O was added to the final
volume of 50 μL. DSF studies were carried out using a Biorad
CFX96 real-time PCR system set on the FRET channel using
490 nm excitation and 580 nm emission filters. Samples were
heated from 25 to 95 °C at 0.05 °C/s. The T
m
value was
determined from the first derivatives of the melting curve in
the CFX Manager Software (Biorad).
Hydrolysis Activity of PETase on PET Film. The
hydrolysis activity of PETase was assessed using a PET film
(Goodfellow, ES301460), which was cut into 5 mm diameter
circles. The films were sequentially washed with 1% SDS (w/
v), ethanol, and distilled water for 30 min each followed by air
drying. Subsequently, the PET film was incubated with 70 μL
of purified enzyme solution in 430 μL of buffer (50 mM
Na
2
CO
3
-NaHCO
3
, pH 9.0) for 168 h at 40 °C. Post-
incubation, the films were washed, air-dried, and then analyzed
using scanning electron microscopy (Hitachi SU3500).
Afterward, the remaining enzyme and buffer solution were
analyzed using HPLC (Shimadzu 20A) with a column size of 5
μm, 4.6 × 150 mm. The mobile phases used were deionized
water (A), methanol (B), and 1% acetic acid (C). The flow
rate was set at 1 mL/min, and terephthalic acid was detected at
a wavelength of 240 nm.

3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1. Single Mutation of the Recombinant IsPETase.
PETase amino acid mutations were carried out in stages,
starting with a single mutation in each protein followed by a
combination of mutations from single mutants that exhibited
the best stability values. Prior to introduction of mutation
using FoldX, improvements were made to the IsPETase model
(PDB ID: 6EQE) to correct poor torsion angles, conflicting
van der Waals bonds, and total energy discrepancies, ensuring
a low ΔG value that indicates stabilization. An increase in
stability from a ΔG of 41.14 to −24.37 kcal/mol (ΔΔG of
−65.51 kcal/mol) was observed after improvements of the
protein model.
In this study, residues L117 and Q119 were mutated in
combination because they can form a π−π “T-shaped”
interaction with Tyr87, a residue that forms an oxyanion
hole.
25
An oxyanion hole is a pocket structure on the active site
of the enzyme that aids in binding to oxyanions (oxygen-
containing anions), thus stabilizing the transition state in
protein−ligand binding.
26
Similarly, mutations I168R and
S188Q were introduced simultaneously because the guanidine
group on R168 can form new hydrogen bonds with the amide
oxygen and oxygen atoms of Q188. Additionally, the I168R
amino acid change results in the formation of a new salt bridge
with residue D186,
26
as confirmed by supporting analyses
using the CIB and ESBRI web servers that showed the addition
of four hydrogen bonds and six salt bridges in the mutant
IsPETase.

Four mutants were identified to increase the stability of
IsPETase: L117F/Q119Y, S121E, and G165A, while the other
three mutants have a neutral effect on the protein (Figure 1A).
The presence of L117F and Q119Y mutants, which have the
highest level of stability, indicates that the stability of the
oxyanion hole region can significantly affect the overall protein
stability. This is beneficial for the enzyme because these
mutants can synergize to enhance both stability and interaction
with ligands. The S121E mutation increases protein stability
through a water-mediated hydrogen bond formed by the
glutamine residue with the N172 residue. Meanwhile, the
G165A mutation reduces the conformational entropy of the
locally unfolded protein.
18,26
In molecular docking studies, identifying the location of the
binding pocket is crucial for accurately placing the ligand in the
desired area and also serves as a parameter for creating grid
boxes in AutoDock. Binding pocket analysis can be performed
using data from PDBSum included in the data model or
additional web servers, such as POCASA 1.1. Based on the
analysis using PDBSum and POCASA, it was found that both
tools identified the same binding area. The largest area
displayed in POCASA 1.1 with Rank 1 (Pocket 19)
corresponds to Cluster 1 in PDBSum, where the most ligand
attachment occurs and where catalytic triads and residues that
interact with ligands are located (Figure 1B). The red box
highlights the ligand binding pocket area on PETase.
Molecular docking studies were conducted between single
mutants obtained from references and three main ligands for
PETase: 2(HE)MHET4 (a mimic of PET polymer), BHET,
and MHET.
25,26
By comparing the molecular docking results
of mutant IsPETases with the wild type, the results revealed
that the S238F mutant exhibited the highest affinity for
2(HE)MHET4 at −6.2 kcal/mol followed by S214H that
showed a high affinity for BHET at −5.8 kcal/mol and N246D
with the highest affinity for MHET at −5.7 kcal/mol (Figure
1C). Even though their levels were not significantly higher, the
mutant PETases demonstrated better binding abilities with
substrates than the wild type.
The S238F mutant enhances the interaction with the ligand
through its aromatic side chain, facilitating easier interaction
with the ligand. In the S214H mutation, the substitution of
serine with histidine improves the aromatic-tunnel shape,
thereby increasing the enzyme’s ability to bind ligands. This
increase in the aromatic side enhances hydrophobic
interactions on the surface and within the protein.
18,27
Meanwhile, the N246D mutation, located near the ligand-
binding site, primarily contributes to the formation of new salt
bridges with R280 rather than hydrophobic or hydrogen
interactions with the ligands.
18,27
To further investigate the
role of the N246D mutant in binding various substrates,
additional analysis was performed, focusing on its combination
with other mutants. This will be elaborated on in the following
section.
3.2. Multiple Mutations of the Recombinant IsPE-
Tase. After a single mutation was conducted, four individual
mutations of PETase were identified for enhancing protein
stability, specifically, L117F/Q119Y, S121E, and G165A, while
the others gave neutral effects on the protein (Figure 2A, Table
S1). Subsequently, these four mutants were combined with
other neutral mutants.
The introduction of a mutation on D186H and R280A
increased the stability by up to −5.0 kcal/mol, indicating the
Figure 2. Stability, molecular docking, and electrostatic potential study of the mutant PETase. (A) Free energy score of single and combination
mutations in kcal/mol. A score less than −0.5 shows the stability of the protein. (B) Binding energies of ligands docked against PETase

stabilization of IsPETase. This stabilized combination was
labeled as a “stable mutant”. Combining stable mutants with
those exhibiting the highest affinity (S214H, S238F, and
N246D) demonstrated that pairing mutants S214H and S238F
within a stable mutant resulted in a lower energy value
compared to combining all three highest affinity mutants
separately, yielding −7.38 and −7.26 kcal/mol, respectively
(Figure 2B). These outcomes may be attributed to the
potential incompatibility between the mutant interaction of
R280A and N246D, where alanine possesses a hydrophobic
residue, while aspartate carries a negative residual charge.
8
Furthermore, we designed the highest affinity and most
stable recombinant PETase with eight mutation sites
PETase
L117F/Q119Y/S121E/G165A/D186H/R280A/S214H/S238F
as IsPETa-
se
MT
. An in silico model has been built to predict the 3D
structure of PETase with multiple mutations (Figure 2C, Table
S1). Each of the mutations has a role in improving the PETase
activity and temperature stability. The residues of L117 and
Q119 can form a “T-shaped” π−π interaction with Tyr87
(residues that form oxyanion holes)
18
and trigger the
stabilization of the transition state in protein−ligand binding.
26
The mutation of aspartate to histidine in D186H assisted in
the formation of water-mediated hydrogen bonds in S121E
and Asn172. In addition, negative charges in aspartate could
cause polarity collisions between high negative charges; thus,
mutation to histidine, which had a slightly positive charge,
could stabilize the area.
8
Moreover, the mutation of arginine to
alanine in R280A changed the surface of the protein,
26
especially in the loop, which may be able to increase protein
stability.
3.3. Interaction of IsPETase
MT
with Substrates. The
molecular docking analysis showed that the IsPETase
MT
had a
stronger affinity for the monomer of PET with a docking value
of −7.3 kcal/mol compared to the IsPETase
WT
value of −6.2
kcal/mol. IsPETase
MT
was also able to interact with the other
polyesters 2-HE(MHEF)
4
and MHBT
3
(Figure 3B,C, Table
S2). In addition, the IsPETase
MT
also had better affinity than
the IsPETase
WT
to MHEN
3
and PCl
4
(Table S2). Meanwhile,
in MHET and BHET, mutant affinity was not significantly
different from the wild type (Table S2).
In the analysis of hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen
bonds, the similarity of interactions with references
17,26−30
between the main ligand 2-HE (MHET)
4
and the wild type
was better than the IsPETase
MT
, with the results of respective
interactions being 63.6 and 45.5%. The polyester ligand that
interacted strongly with the IsPETase
MT
was MHBT
3
with a
total interaction of 54.5%. Meanwhile, the docking simulation
results showed that IsPETase
MT
and IsPETase
W
have similarity
of interactions with 2-HE(MHEF)
4
.
The 3D visualization of IsPETase
MT
showed that the ligands
2-HE(MHET)
4
, 2-HE(MHEF)
4
, and MHBT
3
bound to the
pocket and aromatic tunnel area of PETase (Figure 4). The
visualization of the PETase surface showed that there was a
change in the charge around the binding pocket after mutation
(Figure 2D). After being mutated, the electrostatic potential of
the binding site on the PETase protein becomes more neutral
(hydrophobic) or negative than the wild type. It makes the
polyester ligands easy to attach to the area; thus, the affinity
was stronger, and the interaction was wider.
The Gibbs free energy values between IsPETase
WT
and
IsPETase
MT
in the presence of substrates were determined by
using the MMPBSA method. The comparison of ΔG PETase
with the BHET and 2MHET substrates is depicted in Figure 4.
The Gibbs free energy binding values for the IsPETase
WT
-
BHET and IsPETase
WT
-2MHET complexes are −16.41 and
−18.75 kJ/mol, respectively. Following combined mutations,

more negative ΔG values were obtained, resulting in
IsPETase
MT
-BHET and IsPETase
MT
-2MHET complexes with
ΔG binding values of −21.71 and −24.08 kJ/mol, respectively.
These findings suggest that IsPETase
MT
exhibits a stronger
binding affinity compared to IsPETase
WT
for BHET and
2MHET ligands, with ΔΔG values of −5.30 and −5.33 kJ/
mol, respectively.
3.4. Thermostability Assessment with MD Simula-
tion. The results of MD simulation demonstrate that
IsPETase
MT
exhibits superior thermal stability compared to
IsPETase
WT
(Figure 5). IsPETase
MT
gives a lower RMSD in
comparison to IsPETase
WT
, suggesting that the mutation
results in fewer structural conformational changes during the
simulation when compared to the wild type. From the 300 K
MD simulation results, it can be observed that RMSD
fluctuations reach up to 2.0 Å for IsPETaseWT, while
IsPETaseMT fluctuates only around 1.3 Å.
To assess their stability at high temperatures, the MD
simulation temperature was increased to 450 K to accelerate
the structural change observation. At a time simulation of 30
ns, the RMSD of IsPETaseWT exceeds 6 Å, while
IsPETaseMT remains stable around 6 Å. The trajectory
analysis aligns with the RMSD analysis, clearly indicating that
IsPETaseMT preserves its structural integrity for a duration of
60 ns, while structural damage in IsPETaseWT begins at 30 ns
(Figure 5). Our results suggest that the mutation enhances the
thermal stabilization of PETase.
To evaluate mutations that are crucial for maintaining the
structural stability of IsPETase
MT
, RMSF analysis was
conducted (Figure 6). Based on the RMSF analysis, almost
all mutation points were revealed to play a role in decreasing
RMSF value during a 100 ns simulation. The cumulative effect
of mutations applied to PETase can diminish structural
flexibility, imparting greater rigidity and, in turn, boosting the
thermal stability of PETase.

3.5. Production of PETase. The IsPETase
WT
and
IsPETase
MT
were confirmed to be present in the extracellular
fraction in the ∼30 kDa band. This was supported in
nontransformant E. coli where no band was detected in the
same region as transformant E. coli (Figure 7). In the
IsPETase
WT
, an additional band of ∼30 kDa was identified,
indicating the presence of PETase.
31
From the SDS-PAGE
results, it was found that IsPETase
WT
and IsPETase
MT
can be
expressed and secreted in E. coli in the extracellular fraction
using the Sec-dependent signal peptide pelB (Figure 7). The
results of SDS-PAGE and ImageJ analysis showed that the
optimum PETase production was obtained at 24 °C for 24 h
and with an IPTG concentration of 0.25 mM.
3.6. PETase Catalytic and Thermostability Profile. The
catalytic activity of both PETases was measured in the
temperature range of 24−60 °C using pNPB as a substrate.
The activity of IsPETase
WT
was maximum at 30 °C and stable
only at temperatures ranging from 30 to 40 °C. Then,
IsPETase
WT
activity decreased rapidly at 50 °C and started to
be inactive at 60 °C. Meanwhile, in the IsPETase
MT
, the
activity increased gradually from 20 to 60 °C, reached a
maximum activity at 60 °C, and still had activity up to 70 °C
(Figure 8A). There are also similar results in the
IsPETase
TMK95N/F201I
mutant that has thermostability reaching
60 °C but lower activity at low temperatures.
26
Other studies
that showed similar results were the DuraPETa-
se
S214H−I168R‑W159HS188Q‑R280A‑A180I‑G165A‑Q119Y‑L117F‑T140D
that
withstood the thermostability test for 3 days of incubation in
60 °C temperature.
25
Related to the result, we observed the
thermostability profile of PETases by determining the melting
temperature value (T
m
) using the differential scanning
fluorimetry (DSF) method. The T
m
value of IsPETase
WT
is
40.3 °C, whereas that of IsPETase
MT
increased by 15.7 to 66
°C (Figure 8B).
Each mutated residue played an important role in increasing
thermostability and affinity toward ligands. A previous study
reported other mutations at L117F and Q119Y that played a
role in improving the packaging of the protein surface and
interior to be more hydrophobic and increasing the melting
temperature (T
m
) of the protein. This indicates an increase in
protein thermal stability.
25,26,32
Besides, the mutation at
S214H, S238F, and G165A was used to maintain conformation
and protein folding to make the mutated protein more
stable.
25,26,33,34
The mutation at S121E and R280A also proved
to make the mutated protein more thermostable as was shown
in reports regarding FAST-PETase, which has the combination
of mutation at both sites as well as R224Q and N233 K and
reached a maximum activity toward PET film at 50 °C.
33
Similar results were also obtained in IsPETase
S121E/D186H/R280A
,
with the T
m
value increased by 8.81 °C and activity detected to
be up to 14-fold higher at 40 °C in comparison to the wild
type.
35
The point mutation found in IsPETase
S121E/D186H/R280A
is also utilized as a template for the directed evolution of
IsPETase, resulting in the generation of HOT-PETase through
successive rounds of saturation mutagenesis employing NNK
codons. The engineered HOT-PETase was detected to
maintain optimal activity up to 80 °C, near the PET polymer
glass transition temperature, hence optimizing the PET
degradation process.
36
Unfortunately, since our research did
not include a directed evolution process, the IsPETase
MT
that
was produced only shows remarkable thermostability up to 60
°C as shown in Figure 8.
3.7. PET Film Hydrolysis. The observation was continued
by analyzing the PETase hydrolytic activity using a PET film
(from the supplier GoodFellow) as a substrate. Before testing,
the PETase concentration was equalized to 0.5 mg/mL.
Although the optimal activity temperature of IsPETase
MT
is 60
°C, the observation was carried out at 40 °C to standardize the
treatment with IsPETase
WT
, which only has degradation
activity up to 40 °C. This standardized treatment allows for
a comparison of the degradation results on PET. The PET
plastic was damaged compared with the control (Figure 9).
The IsPETase
WT
seemed to erode and form spiderweb-like
pores on the PET film. The hydrolysis activity of IsPETase
MT
appears to be successfully improved. From the visual results, it
could be seen that the damage caused by IsPETase
MT
appears
to be greater in degrading the coating on the surface of PET
plastic film compared to IsPETase
WT
. Several amino acid
residue mutations played a role in improving the catalytic
activity of PETase. Mutating R280A could make PETase more
hydrophobic and form a nonprotruding cleft so that it can
make PET substrate binding more stable.
24
The mutation at
S214H could also increase the aromaticity in the binding
pocket as well as increase the activity toward PET substrates.
29
Furthermore, similar results were also found in the S238F/
W159H double mutant PETase where S238F can change the

binding cleft that was an integral part of the aromatic
interaction to increase the binding activity on PET
substrates.
32,37
The results indicate that both IsPETase
WT
and IsPETase
MT
enzymes exhibit degradation activity against the PET film, with
the most significant damage observed from the incubation with
the IsPETase
MT
. Therefore, further analysis to quantify the
yield of terephthalic acid (TPA) was done only for
IsPETase
MT
. TPA yielded from the degradation of the PET
film by IsPETase
MT
was quantified using HPLC after 3 min of
retention time. After 7 days of incubation with IsPETase
MT
, the
TPA concentration obtained was 0.875 mM (Figure S4).
While this result demonstrates significant and specific
degradation activity between the enzyme and the PET
substrate, a study conducted by Menzel et al. reported that
incubation of IsPETase
WT
with PET substrate for 4 days

produced 1.3 mM of terephthalic acid.
38
The main two factors
that are possibly contributing to the lower production of TPA
compared to IsPETase
WT
are the formation of aggregates and/
or enzyme denaturation, especially after a long incubation
period.
39
This assumption was confirmed by a report from Wei
et al.
40
that IsPETase tends to lose its activity after 1 h at
temperatures near or above 40 °C. Unlike other PET
hydrolytic enzymes, LCC can maintain its degradation activity
toward commercial PET bottles and its thermostability for up
to 3 days at 65 °C. However, the LCC that was used can
maintain its activity and thermostability with the addition of
calcium ions using 35 mM CaCl
2
.
6,10
Based on the results, IsPET
MT
, which was expressed and
secreted by E. coli BL21(DE3), has the potential to be further
developed in the future. One of the improvements that can
enhance this enzyme is by adding a nonionic surfactant

when the temperature goes higher than 40 °C. In comparison, IsPETase

from 20 to 60 °C, with maximum activity as well as thermostability demonstrated at 60 °C. (B) Thermostability profile defined in melting

anionic surfactants to the low-crystallinity PET film prior to
the addition of PETase.
11
Surfactants decrease the hydro-
phobicity of the polymer surface, facilitating the binding of the
enzyme to its substrate. Another improvement that can be used
to enhance the binding affinity of this enzyme toward PET
substrate is through enzyme fusion with carbohydrate-binding
modules, making it easier for the catalytic enzyme to bind with
the surface of PET, thus improving PET degradation.

■
CONCLUSIONS
To summarize, this study developed an IsPETase
MT
that
exhibits enhanced thermostability and increased affinity for
ligands compared to wild-type IsPETase
WT
by combining
multiple point mutations. The mutations contribute to a higher
affinity for primary ligand 2-HE(MHET)
4
as well as for other
polyesters such as 2-HE(MHEF)
4
and MHBT
3
. This strategy
has been proven to produce IsPETase
MT
with greater
degradation of PET plastic film compared to IsPETase
WT
.
While the degradation activity of IsPETase
WT
declines
significantly above 40 °C, in contrast, IsPETase
MT
maintained
high degradation activity up to 60 °C with a melting
temperature of 66 °C, which is 15.7 °C higher than that of
IsPETase
WT
. The quantification of TPA produced after 7 days
of incubation using the IsPETase
MT
enzyme yielded 0.875 mM
TPA. The observed improvements in the IsPETase
MT
enzyme
highlight its potential for further research and industrial-scale
production. Scaling up the production of the PETase enzyme
for the industry could pave the way for more sustainable and
ecofriendly approaches to managing PET plastic waste.
