Abstract: In recent years, several plastic-degrading enzymes with efficient depolymeriza-
tion abilities for PET have been reported. Here, we report a bioprocess for mixed PET
waste depolymerization using crude extracellularly expressed enzymes in E. coli. The en-
zymes, namely FastPETase, LCC, and LCCICCG, were screened to depolymerize amorphous
PET powder and films of different sizes and crystallinity. FastPETase, LCC, and LCCICCG
achieved approximately 25, 34, and 70% depolymerization, respectively, when applied to
13 g L−1 of PET film, powder, or mixed waste in optimized enzyme conditions without
any pH control. The yield of terephthalic acid in the hydrolytic process was maximum
for LCCICCG followed by LCC and FastPETase. Finally, extracellular LCCICCG-producing
E. coli cells were cultivated using minimal media supplemented with 0.1% ammonium
chloride and 1% glycerol as nitrogen and carbon sources in a bioreactor with a final pro-
tein content and specific activity of 119 ± 5 mg L−1 and 1232 ± 18 U mg−1, respectively.
Nearly complete depolymerization of 13 g L −1 PET and 23.8 g L −1 post-consumer PET
was achieved in 50 h using crude LCCICCG supernatant, without enzyme purification, at
62 ◦C. A bioprocess was thus developed to depolymerize 100 g L−1 mixed PET trays and
bottle waste (MW1 and MW2), reaching 78% and 50% yield at 62 ◦C with a crude enzyme
loading of 2.32 mg g−1 PET in 60 h. The results demonstrate an easy PET depolymerization
strategy that could be exploited in large-scale facilities for efficient plastic waste treatment.

1. Introduction
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the most important plastics in volume,
accounting for 18% of global plastic production. The huge consumption and usage generate
a huge amount of discarded PET plastics, and its subsequent mismanagement severely
damages the ecological environment [1–5]. Globally, only 9% of plastic waste is recycled,
leaving the rest accumulating in landfills or natural environments, where it persists for
centuries. Approximately 19–23 million tons of plastic waste leaks into aquatic ecosystems,
polluting lakes, rivers, and seas, and this figure could triple by 2040 without intervention
(UNEP). The Ellen MacArthur Foundation report (breaking the plastic wave) predicted
that there will be more plastic waste than fish biomass in the sea by 2050. A recent study
employed machine learning to foresee that annual mismanaged plastic waste will nearly
double to 121 million metric tons by 2050. Annual greenhouse gas emissions from plastic
waste are also projected to grow by 37% to 3.35 billion tons of CO2 [6]. This underscores the
urgent need for sustainable waste management solutions. To overcome this problem, PET
plastics recycling (thermo-chemical, mechanical, and biological) has been envisaged as an

efficient and effective approach. It extends PET’s life cycle, reduces non-renewable resource
consumption, decreases plastic pollution, and protects the ecological environment [ 5,6].
However, PET thermo-mechanical recycling approaches have some drawbacks related to
waste sourcing and their decreased mechanical properties during the extrusion process [7].
The chemical hydrolysis of PET (polyethylene terephthalate) involves breaking its ester
bonds in the presence of water, to produce terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol
(EG). This process, often catalyzed by acids such as sulfuric acid or bases, e.g., sodium
hydroxide, is used for PET depolymerization and recycling [ 5–7]. However, the chemi-
cal hydrolysis of PET requires high temperatures, uses very large amounts of chemicals,
is energy-intensive, and can release harmful compounds. The process often generates
unwanted side products, leading to purification challenges and potential environmental
pollution [6,7]. Mixed plastic waste further complicates these processes due to its com-
plex nature (types, composition, color, and additives). It is difficult to recycle it due to
different polymer types and contamination. The recycling process for mixed plastics is
energy-intensive, less efficient, and results in downcycled materials with limited utility due
to cross-contamination. Biological depolymerization mediated by enzymes has emerged as
an efficient and sustainable alternative for plastic treatment. Plastic waste recycling negates
harmful environmental consequences by utilizing less energy-intensive processes, and
fewer chemicals, and recovering valuable components from plastic waste. The enzymatic
hydrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) offers a sustainable recycling pathway. It
aligns with global efforts to reduce plastic pollution and foster a more sustainable materials
economy [1,8–10]. This approach helps close the loop in a circular economy and offers
a more environmentally friendly alternative to chemical recycling methods, which often
involve harsher conditions and generate more waste [11]. PET monomers are linked by
ester bonds, which can be enzymatically hydrolyzed, producing terephthalic acid (TPA)
and ethylene glycol (EG) [2]. Several hydrolases, including lipases, cutinases, and esterases,
have been tested for PET hydrolysis. Lipases primarily act on long-chain triglycerides
and require hydrophobic interfaces for activation, making them less efficient on PET. Cuti-
nases, such as Thermobifida fusca cutinase, show better PET degradation but with a limited
substrate binding ability. Esterases generally hydrolyze short-chain esters and lack the
structural adaptations needed for PET polymer breakdown. In contrast, PETases, like those
from Ideonella sakaiensis, have a uniquely open active site and enhanced substrate binding
regions [1,12]. After the discovery of PET hydrolyzing cutinases two decades ago, several
hydrolases have been identified and improved for PET hydrolysis [ 1,7,12–14]. Recently,
two mutants of thermostableIsPETase [15,16] from the bacteriumIdeonella sakaiensis, namely
FastPETase [17] and HotPETase [9], were reported for improved PET depolymerization.
In another study, a leaf-branch compost cutinase (LCC) [18] was engineered to obtain the
LCCICCG mutant [19]. The enzyme paved the way for the first industrial PET recycling
plant unit in France run by Carbios. Recently, Arnal et al. [2] compared four reported PET
hydrolases (LCCICCG, FAST-PETase, HotPETase, and PES-H1L92F/Q94Y) and demonstrated
their ability to perform PET hydrolysis in industrial settings. They also discussed critical
parameters to upscale an enzyme process for industrial deployment indicating that the
crystallinity of PET, surface area, reaction temperature, the efficiency of the enzyme vs.
recrystallization, and substrate loading are among the most critical factors. It is now well
known that PET hydrolases prefer amorphous regions of PET and no PET hydrolases have
been reported to act efficiently on highly crystalline forms of the polymer, typically found in
consumer products [2,20,21]. It is necessary to perform a pretreatment to convert PET to its
amorphous state to meet the high enzymatic conversion essential to meet techno-economic
goals. The thermostability, expression yields, and enzyme activity are also crucial factors in
reaching industrial scales. The pretreatment of postconsumer waste and crystallinity of PET
Polymers 2025, 17, 763 3 of 19
powder and enzyme production platform negatively affect the overall process. The extent
of PET breakdown, substrate loading, enzyme price (production and purification cost),
and enzyme loading are all key cost drivers [22]. The enzyme purification process requires
high energy, chemicals, and water consumption with an overall negative impact on the
environment and process economy. Therefore, it would be worthwhile to assess the poten-
tial of crude enzyme on PET hydrolysis focusing on high yield enzyme production in the
extracellular supernatant. In this study, we have compared the depolymerization efficiency
of three PET hydrolases (FastPETase, LCC, and LCCICCG) on different PET substrate types
such as powder or films, amorphous or crystalline, pure or mixed waste, and optimized
key variables in small-scale. We demonstrated the extracellular expression of LCCICCG in
E. coli and the utilization of crude supernatant to catalyze efficient depolymerization of
pure PET powder, films, post-consumer trays, and mixed trays and bottle waste (originated
from Spain). A bioprocess has been developed for the efficient depolymerization of mixed
PET waste in a 1 L bioreactor and subsequent recovery and purification of TPA from the
reaction mixture. This work provides an important foundation for a robust one-pot (2-steps)
enzymatic production and hydrolysis process that can be extended to high-expression hosts
to minimize the cost of enzyme production and purification, thus further improving the
PET depolymerization viability. This approach opens for potentially more sustainable and
low-cost PET hydrolytic processes to biotechnologically recycle real mixed PET waste.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Materials, Plasmids, and Enzymes
All the chemicals used in this study were of analytical grade. The p-Nitrophenol
butyrate (pNPB), TPA, and MHET were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO,
USA). All the plasmids and gene constructs were synthesized by Gene Universal (Newark,
DE, USA). The sequences for FastPETase, LCC, and LCCICCG [17–20] were retrieved from
the PDB database, codon-optimized, cloned into pET26b (+) and pET28a (+) vector from
Gene Universal (Newark, DE, USA). PET films (0.25 mm amorphous and crystalline) were
purchased from Goodfellow Cambridge Limited (Hamburg, Germany). PET powders
of different sizes (0.05, 0.1, 0.25, 0.75; Table 1) were kindly provided by Dr. Alessandro
Pellis, University of Genova, Italy, and cryo-milled to obtain different sizes and crystallinity.
Mixed plastic waste was received from different sources/origins and assigned the acronyms
MW1-2 (Table 1) and cryo-milled PET powder (0.08 mm) as part of the UPLIFT project from
AIMPLAS, Valencia, Spain. This waste was composed only of PET (MW1 and MW2) and
were micronized to obtain the sample size of 1 mm in diameter using an ultra-centrifugal
grinder (RetschTM 171 ZM200, ATS Scientific, Madrid, Spain) or cryo-milled to obtain
different sizes (Table 1).

2.2. Expression and Purification of Enzymes
FastPETase, LCC, and LCCICCG were expressed in the electrocompetent Escherichia
coli strain BL21 (DE3) using pET28a (+) (FastPETase) and pET26b (+) vector (LCC and
LCCICCG). The sequence of LCC and LCC ICCG contained N-terminal PelB peptide for
periplasmic expression. A single colony of E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells containing the gene
FastPETase or LCC or LCC ICCG was transferred in 5 mL LB medium or M9 medium
(Table S1) supplemented with 50 µg mL−1 kanamycin and incubated at 37 ◦C for 5 h.
One mL of starter culture was transferred to a 50 mL LBKan medium or M9 medium and
incubated at 37 ◦C and 190 rpm till the OD 600 reached 0.6–0.8. The protein production
was induced using 0.5 mM (FastPETase) or 1 mM (LCC and LCCICCG) IPTG and further
incubated at 20 ◦C (FastPETase) and 30 ◦C (LCC and LCCICCG) for 24 h, respectively. The
cells were harvested by centrifugation at 8000× g for 20 min at 4 ◦C. For FastPETase, the
cell pellet was resuspended (10% wet weight) in lysis or sample loading buffer (50 mM
potassium phosphate buffer, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM Imidazole; pH 7.5). The cells were lysed
using sonication (45% amplitude; 9 s on, 10 s off; 15 min, and 2 cycles). The lysate was
centrifuged at 12,000× g for 30 min and pellet was discarded and the supernatant was used
for further purification. For LCC and LCCICCG, the supernatant was retained, and the pH
was adjusted to 7.5. The supernatant was equilibrated with imidazole (5 mM) and 300 mM
NaCl to mimic loading buffer conditions. The HisTrap FF column was pre-equilibrated
(5 column volume) with 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM Im-
idazole; pH 7.5 (AKTA explorer system, GE Healthcare). The 0.22 µm filtered cell-free
supernatant was loaded onto the column 2 mL min −1). After loading, the column was
washed with wash buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate buffer, 300 mM NaCl, 20 mM
Imidazole; pH 7.5) with 4 column volumes (2 mL min−1) to remove unbound proteins. The
protein was eluted (1 mL min−1) with elution buffer (50 mM potassium phosphate buffer,
300 mM NaCl, 200 mM Imidazole; pH 7.5). The eluted fractions were checked on the SDS
PAGE. The purified fractions were pooled, dialyzed, and concentrated using 3 kDa Amicon
filters (4000 g) against 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). The purified enzyme
was used for the depolymerization of PET powder and film.
2.3. Estimation of Esterase Activity and Protein Concentration
Esterase activity was measured at 50 ◦C (FastPETase) and 65 ◦C (LCC and LCCICCG)
using p-NPB as a substrate as previously reported [23,24]. Solution A was composed of
86 µL of 50 mM p-nitrophenol butyrate (p-NPB) and 1000 µL of 2-butanol and Solution B
was prepared using 40 µL of Solution A and 1 mL of 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer
(pH 8.0). A final assay mixture made up of 200 µL of Solution B and 20 µL of enzyme
solution (diluted if required). The change in absorbance was recorded at 405 nm due to the
hydrolytic release of p-nitrophenol (p-NP), which was measured using a microplate reader
(Biotek, Santa Clara, CA, USA). One unit is defined as the enzyme required to hydrolyze
1 µmol of substrate per minute under the given assay conditions. The standard of p-NP
Polymers 2025, 17, 763 5 of 19
was prepared (10 µM–100 µM). The protein concentration was determined using Bradford
assay [23,25]. Briefly, 4 µL of the protein solution was added into the wells of a 96-well
micro-titer plate and 196 µL of Bradford solution and incubated for 5 min. The potassium
phosphate buffer (50 mM, pH 8.0) was used as blank, and the absorption was measured
after 5 min at 595 nm. The protein concentration was calculated using BSA as a standard
(1–100 µg mL−1).
2.4. Evaluating Enzyme Performance on a Small Scale on Different Powder and Films
For all the experiments, 13.0 ± 0.5 mg of PET amorphous film (size 0.5 × 1 cm,
thickness 0.25 mm GoodFellow) or powder (Table 1) were incubated with 0.5 mg g −1
PET of purified enzyme (FastPETase, LCC, and LCC LCCICCG) in 1.0 mL buffer (50 mM
phosphate buffer, pH 8.0) in separate reactions. The Eppendorf tubes were incubated
in a thermo-shaker (constant vertical shaking) at an optimum temperature of 50 ◦C [13],
65 ◦C, and 72 ◦C [19] for FastPETase, LCC, and LCCICCG, respectively. The blank (buffer)
and control (film/powder and buffer without enzymes) were also incubated. The reaction
was monitored for 96 h and the released monomers were quantified using HPLC-DAD
analysis. The monomer concentration is expressed and presented as molar yield (Supple-
mentary file. S1.1).
2.5. Evaluation of Different Reaction Variables for PET Hydrolysis
Different 50 mM buffer systems, such as KH 2PO4-K2HPO4 (pH 6.5–7.5), KH 2PO4-
NaOH (pH 8.0–9.0), glycine-NaOH (pH 9.0–10.0), NaHCO3-Na2CO3 (pH 10.0–11.0), were
tested for the depolymerization of PET film. Different enzyme concentrations (mg g −1
PET) for FastPETase, LCC, and LCCICCG (0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 1, and 2 mg g−1 PET) were used to
optimize the effect of enzyme loading on PET depolymerization. 13.0 mg of PET powder
(0.08 mm cryo-milled amorphous) and film (0.2 mm amorphous) were incubated in 1 mL
KH2PO4-NaOH buffer (50 mM, pH 8.0) for 96 h in different enzyme concentrations. The
incubation temperature (30, 40, 50, 65, 72, and 80 ◦C), and reaction time (2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 30,
36, 48, 60, 72, and 96 h) were also studied.
2.6. Evaluating Enzyme Performance in 10 mL (Without pH Control) and 1 L Bioreactor
(pH Control)
The depolymerization of PET film (0.25 mm amorphous), PET powder (0.08 mm
amorphous), PET tray waste, and PET bottle waste from Spain was performed in 10 mL
falcon tubes in the optimized conditions without any pH control and subsequently in a 1 L
bioreactor (Biostat A, Sartorius, Göttingen, Germany) under controlled conditions. 13 g L−1
PET film was added to 1000 mL of 50 mM phosphate-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0) and 0.5 mg
g−1 PET (FastPETse), and 1.0 mg g−1 PET (LCC and LCCICCG) in separate reactions. The
reaction was performed at 50, 65, and 72◦C for FastPETase, LCC, and LCCICCG, respectively.
The initial pH of the reaction was adjusted to 8.0 using 1 M NaOH. The samples were
collected at different time intervals and monomers were quantified using HPLC analysis.
The reaction was stopped after 96 h, residual PET films were recovered from the reaction,
and weight loss (Supplementary file, S1.2) was measured.
2.7. Production of LCCICCG in the Bioreactor and PET Hydrolysis
For seed preparation, E. coli containing LCCICCG was streaked on LB agar plates
(50 mg L−1 Kanamycin) and incubated at 37◦C overnight. One single colony was inoculated
to 5 mL M9 medium (Table S3) in a 50 mL falcon for overnight growth at 37 ◦C and
180 rpm. A 1 mL measurement of this seed culture was transferred to a 250 mL flask
containing 50 mL fresh M9 medium to grow for another 12 h until an OD600 of 1.2–1.8 was
reached. This culture was used to inoculate the 2 L batch bioreactor (Biostat A, Sartorius) at
Polymers 2025, 17, 763 6 of 19
2% (v/v). The exponentially growing cells from the seed culture were transferred into the
bioreactor to initiate the fermentation (t = 0 h). The dissolved oxygen level of the growth
experiments was set at 20% of air saturation by cascade controls of agitation speed. A
two-stage temperature control was implemented, i.e., 37 ◦C for the growth phase during
0–4 h and 30◦C for enzyme production in the remainder of the run. The pH was maintained
at 7.2 throughout the run by feeding 1 M sodium hydroxide solution or 1 M HCl solution.
When the O.D600 reached 0.6–0.8, the temperature was lowered to 30 ◦C and the protein
production was induced with 1 mM IPTG and kept for growth till 24 h. The cell debris
was removed by centrifugation at 10,000× g for 15 min. The pH of the supernatant (crude
LCCICCG) was adjusted to 8.0 (using 1 M NaOH) in the same reactor, and the reaction
temperature was adjusted to 62 ◦C (the maximum temperature that could be reached in the
bioreactor) and at a fixed rpm speed of 600 using a Rushton impeller to provide efficient
mixing. Then, 13 g L−1 PET material (film or powder) was added to the supernatant and
monitored for 96 h. The pH of the reaction was maintained at 8.0 with 1 M NaOH. The
monomers and oligomers released were measured using HPLC at different intervals, and
quantitative NMR was used to calculate the mass balance.
2.8. Depolymerization of Mixed PET Waste Using LCCICCG in 1 L
LCCICCG was produced using E. coli BL21 cells as described in the above section in
a 2 L bioreactor as described earlier. After growth, the cell debris was removed and the
supernatant was concentrated using a filtration device (10 kDa, Merck Millipore, Burlington,
MA, USA) to 1 L. Different PET materials i.e., PET tray (commercial; 24 g L−1), PET tray
waste (100 g L −1), and PET bottle waste (100 g L −1) were depolymerized in separate
experiments using approximately 0.8 mg g−1 PET of ICCG in a 1 L bioreactor (Biostat A-
Sartorius) under cascade pH control (pH 8.0 using 1 M NaOH) and 62 ◦C for 96 h. The
temperature regulation was performed in the water-jacketed bioreactor, and a Rushton
impeller was used to maintain constant agitation at 600 rpm. The reaction was initiated
by the addition of PET substrate (mix tray or bottle waste) into the reactor containing
crude LCCICCG at 62 ◦C, 600 rpm, and cascade pH control at 8.0. The samples of 5 mL
from the PET hydrolysis were collected at different time intervals from the sampling
port. After the completion of the reaction, the residual PET and protein were removed by
centrifugation. TPA was recovered from the reaction mixture using a modified protocol [26].
The purification of TPA from PET hydrolysate was performed by increasing the pH to
over 9.0 to ensure the solubilization of all the monomers followed by centrifugation at
10,000 rpm to remove any debris of denatured proteins. The pH of the supernatant was
decreased (to 2.0) stepwise to monitor the precipitation of TPA. The precipitates were
washed with cold acidified water, lyophilized, and analyzed by 1H-NMR for purity.
2.9. Advanced Analysis
2.9.1. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC)
HPLC analysis was performed for all the PET hydrolysis reactions to quantify the
monomers (TPA, MHET released). Next, 500 µL samples were taken, centrifuged at
20,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was diluted 1:1 with methanol. TPA, MHET,
and BHET standards were prepared in 50% methanol (v/v). The samples were analyzed
using a Dionex Ultimate 3000 system, fitted with a diode array detector. A C18 column
(Phenomenex Luna 5 µm, 250 mm × 4.6 mm) at 30 ◦C was used for the separation of the
products of the reaction, with 0.1% formic acid in water (A) and methanol (B) as the mobile
phase. The solvent gradient was as follows: 10% B (0–5 min), increased linearly to 50%
(5–17 min), and 100% B (17–20 min). The flow rate was 1 mL min −1 and the injection
volume was 2 µL, with detection at 241 nm and a total run time of 20 min.
Polymers 2025, 17, 763 7 of 19
2.9.2. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)
Samples were prepared by mixing 500 µL of supernatant from the enzymatic reaction
with 25 µL of a 200 mM solution of 3-(Trimethylsilyl)-2,2,3,3-tetradeuteropropionic acid
sodium salt (TSP-D4) in D2O. The methyl signal of TSP served as an internal standard for
the chemical shift (δ = 0 ppm). 1H-NMR spectra were recorded on a BRUKER AVIII-600
MHz NMR spectrometer, equipped with a cryogenic CPP-TCI probe (Bruker Scientific
LLC, Billerica, MA, USA). Spectra were recorded at 298.1 K with a standard 1D pulse
sequence with an acquisition time of 2.73 s (64 k complex data points, spectral width of
20 ppm). The relaxation delay was set to 25.5 s. During the last 5 s of the relaxation delay, a
weak continuous-wave irradiation of γB1/2π = 70 Hz was applied for water suppression.
Resonance assignment in product mixtures was conducted by comparing chemical shifts
with spectra of pure standards [11].
2.9.3. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) Analysis of PET Materials
The thermal behavior of the PET film and powder was determined by using DSC.
The DSC experiment was carried out using NETZSCH Proteus® for Differential Scanning
Calorimetry (DSC). In the first scan, each sample was heated to 300 ◦C at a heating rate of
15 ◦C min−1. The sample was then cooled at the same rate before reheating the samples to
300 ◦C. The test samples, weighing about 8.0 ± 2.0 mg, were placed in a T-zero thermionic
aluminum pan for analysis and all tests were carried out under a nitrogen atmosphere. The
percentage of crystallinity (Xc) was calculated based on the equation (Equation (1)) below:
Xc = ∆Hm − ∆Hc
wt ∗ ∆Hf × 100 (1)
∆Hm is the enthalpy of melting that can be determined by integrating the endothermic
melting peak; ∆Hc is the enthalpy of cold crystallization and determined by integrating the
exothermic cold crystallization peak; wt is the weight fraction of polyester in the plastic;
and ∆Hf 100% is the enthalpy of melting for a fully crystalline polymer and taken from the
literature as 140.1 J g−1.
3. Results and Discussion
3.1. Expression, Production, and Purification of FastPETase, LCC, and LCCICCG
FastPETase, LCC, and LCC ICCG were expressed in the Escherichia coli strain BL21
(DE3). FastPETase was obtained from the cytoplasmic fraction (Figure 1a) after the
cell lysis whereas LCC and LCC ICCG were obtained in extracellular supernatant
(Figure 1b,c and Figure S1). LCC and LCC ICCG contain N-terminal pelB leader peptide
that guides protein into the periplasmic space. The pelB peptide does not correspond to
the active transport of the enzymes to extracellular space. However, the enzymes were
recovered from the culture supernatant. It could be attributed to the phospholipase activity
of these enzymes especially cutinases [27–29] which makes the cell membrane permeable
and the cause leaking of the enzyme out of the cell. There was no cell cytotoxicity observed
during the growth phase and enzyme production. After expression and purification, a final
yield of 26, 35, and 32 mg L−1 of culture was obtained with a specific activity of 968 ± 15,
1430 ± 27, and 2187 ± 19 U mg−1 for FastPETase, LCC, and LCCICCG, respectively (Table
S1).

3.2. Enzymatic Depolymerization of Diﬀerent Powders and Films in Small-Scale 
FastPETase, LCC, and LCCICCG are among the best polyester hydrolases reported so 
far and are known to depolymerize aliphatic and aromatic polyesters including PET [2,17–
19]. The puriﬁed enzymes were used for PET depolymerization experiments on a small 
scale (1 mL) without any pH control. Diﬀerent PET powders and ﬁlms have been used in 
this study and all the materials were characterized using DSC analysis (Tables 1 and S2, 
Figure S11). Preliminary tests were made, using the puriﬁed enzyme (0.5 mg g
−1 PET), 13 
g L−1 of PET ﬁlm or powder, and 50 mM bicin NaOH bu ﬀer at the respective optimum 
temperature of the enzyme, i.e., 50, 65, and 72 °C for FastPETase, LCC and LCCICCG in 1.0 
mL reactions. The speciﬁc activities of the enzymes were calculated using the pNPB assay 
and expressed as U/mg and an equal number of units were added to the reaction mixture 
in all depolymerization assays. Then, 968 ± 15, 1430 ± 27, and 2187 ± 19 U mg−1 were used 
for FastPETase, LCC, and LCCICCG, respectively. FastPETase had lower molar yields (%), 
i.e., 6.2, 12.3 (P80A), and 6.0 and 10.8% (P750A) of TPA and MHET, respectively, relative 
to the total PET compared to the other two enzymes (Figure 2a). LCC treated P80A and 
P750A reactions molar yield of 12 and 18.1% TPA and 16.7 and 15.5% MHET, respectively, 
(Figure 2b). LCC ICCG exhibited a maximum yield of TPA (57 and 58 mol%) and MHET 
(15.3 and 16 mol%) during the depolymerization of cryo-milled PET powders (P80A, 
P750A) (Figure 2c). The depolymerization of PET 0.2 mm Goodfellow PET by FastPETase 
resulted in 20% weight loss (Figure 2d) which was lower than LCC
ICCG (60%) and LCC 
(27%). LCCICCG treated PET ﬁlm (F250A) also had maximum weight loss (60%) and yielded 
45.1% TPA and 12.3% of MHET (Figure 2f). LCC ICCG seems to have better MHET hydrol-
ysis activity, better substrate binding, and optimized enzyme thermal stability under the 
tested buﬀer conditions that contributed to the increased TPA yield compared to LCC and 
FastPETase.

29.0 kDa, and (LCCICCG 27.3 kDa) with actual molecular weight of 28.6 kDa. The gels were prepared
twice with the gel shown representative of the set.
3.2. Enzymatic Depolymerization of Different Powders and Films in Small-Scale
FastPETase, LCC, and LCCICCG are among the best polyester hydrolases reported
so far and are known to depolymerize aliphatic and aromatic polyesters including
PET [ 2,17–19]. The purified enzymes were used for PET depolymerization experiments
on a small scale (1 mL) without any pH control. Different PET powders and films have
been used in this study and all the materials were characterized using DSC analysis
(Tables 1 and S2, Figure S11). Preliminary tests were made, using the purified enzyme
(0.5 mg g−1 PET), 13 g L−1 of PET film or powder, and 50 mM bicin NaOH buffer at the
respective optimum temperature of the enzyme, i.e., 50, 65, and 72 ◦C for FastPETase, LCC
and LCCICCG in 1.0 mL reactions. The specific activities of the enzymes were calculated
using the pNPB assay and expressed as U/mg and an equal number of units were added
to the reaction mixture in all depolymerization assays. Then, 968 ± 15, 1430 ± 27, and
2187 ± 19 U mg−1 were used for FastPETase, LCC, and LCCICCG, respectively. FastPETase
had lower molar yields (%), i.e., 6.2, 12.3 (P80A), and 6.0 and 10.8% (P750A) of TPA and
MHET, respectively, relative to the total PET compared to the other two enzymes (Figure 2a).
LCC treated P80A and P750A reactions molar yield of 12 and 18.1% TPA and 16.7 and
15.5% MHET, respectively, (Figure 2b). LCCICCG exhibited a maximum yield of TPA (57
and 58 mol%) and MHET (15.3 and 16 mol%) during the depolymerization of cryo-milled
PET powders (P80A, P750A) (Figure 2c). The depolymerization of PET 0.2 mm Goodfellow
PET by FastPETase resulted in 20% weight loss (Figure 2d) which was lower than LCCICCG
(60%) and LCC (27%). LCCICCG treated PET film (F250A) also had maximum weight loss
(60%) and yielded 45.1% TPA and 12.3% of MHET (Figure 2f). LCC ICCG seems to have
better MHET hydrolysis activity, better substrate binding, and optimized enzyme thermal
stability under the tested buffer conditions that contributed to the increased TPA yield
compared to LCC and FastPETase.

Figure 2. Depolymerization of diﬀerent PET powders and ﬁlms (amorphous and crystalline) by (a,d) 
FastPETase, ( b,e) LCC, and ( c,f) LCC ICCG. The reaction mixture was composed of 50 mM Bicin-
NaOH buﬀer (pH 8.0), 13 g L −1 PET powder or ﬁlm, and 0.5 mg g−1 PET enzyme. The reaction was 
incubated for 96 h at the respective optimum temp erature of the enzymes, i.e., 50 °C (FastPETase), 
65 °C (LCC), and LCCICCG (72 °C) without any pH control. 
The idea was to use powder of di ﬀerent sizes and crystallinities to see its e ﬀect on 
the enzymatic reaction. It is anticipated that smaller powder sizes increases surface area 
and reduces diﬀusion limitations, thereby improving enzymatic hydrolysis. The eﬀect of 
increasing crystallinity of powder and ﬁlms on the depolymerization and monomer re-
lease by these enzymes was evident where the enzyme e ﬃciency was severely reduced 
both for powders and ﬁlms (Figure 2a–f). LCCICCG was the most active enzyme on crystal-
line PET (Figure 2f) but had three times less depolymerization than on amorphous PET. 
The crystallinity, chain mobility, molecular size, surface topography, and hydrophobicity 
of PET greatly in ﬂuence enzyme performance [11,29–32]. A crystallinity exceeding 20% 
has been proposed to signiﬁcantly impede the enzymatic depolymerization process as ev-
idenced in quenched PET powders (27.6% crystallinity) [2,12]. Additionally, the crystal-
line PET powder of diﬀerent sizes did not show any improvement in terms of total depol-
ymerization by the enzymes (Figure 2a–c). Brizendine et al. [33] also demonstrated that 
particle size reduction in PET only aﬀects the initial rate of hydrolysis but not the overall 
conversion. PET hydrolases adsorb non-speciﬁcally on the PET surface, resulting in either 
a productive complex leading to PET degradation by binding close to the active site, or in 
an unproductive complex [31,34]. According to the Sabatier principle, when interactions 
between enzyme and PET (substrate) are of intermediary strength, the reaction is optimal 
[35,36]. 
3.3. Diﬀerent Variables Inﬂuencing Enzymatic PET Hydrolysis 
After the preliminary tests, P80A and F250A were used in subsequent experiments. 
Enzyme loading for eﬃcient conversion is an important parameter of enzymatic processes 
such as PET hydrolysis. PET weight loss and monomer release reached a maximum (24.4% 
weight loss, molar yield of 10.3, and 15% of TPA and MHET) when 0.5 mg g
−1 PET FastPE-
Tase was used at 50 °C in potassium phosphate-NaOH buﬀer (pH 8.0) after 96 h (Figure 
3a). Interestingly, the PET hydrolysis di d not improve when the concentration of

Bicin-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0), 13 g L−1 PET powder or film, and 0.5 mg g−1 PET enzyme. The reaction
was incubated for 96 h at the respective optimum temperature of the enzymes, i.e., 50◦C (FastPETase),
65 ◦C (LCC), and LCCICCG (72 ◦C) without any pH control.
The idea was to use powder of different sizes and crystallinities to see its effect on
the enzymatic reaction. It is anticipated that smaller powder sizes increases surface area
and reduces diffusion limitations, thereby improving enzymatic hydrolysis. The effect of
increasing crystallinity of powder and films on the depolymerization and monomer release
by these enzymes was evident where the enzyme efficiency was severely reduced both
for powders and films (Figure 2a–f). LCCICCG was the most active enzyme on crystalline
PET (Figure 2f) but had three times less depolymerization than on amorphous PET. The
crystallinity, chain mobility, molecular size, surface topography, and hydrophobicity of PET
greatly influence enzyme performance [11,29–32]. A crystallinity exceeding 20% has been
proposed to significantly impede the enzymatic depolymerization process as evidenced
in quenched PET powders (27.6% crystallinity) [ 2,12]. Additionally, the crystalline PET
powder of different sizes did not show any improvement in terms of total depolymerization
by the enzymes (Figure 2a–c). Brizendine et al. [ 33] also demonstrated that particle size
reduction in PET only affects the initial rate of hydrolysis but not the overall conversion.
PET hydrolases adsorb non-specifically on the PET surface, resulting in either a productive
complex leading to PET degradation by binding close to the active site, or in an unpro-
ductive complex [31,34]. According to the Sabatier principle, when interactions between
enzyme and PET (substrate) are of intermediary strength, the reaction is optimal [35,36].
3.3. Different Variables Influencing Enzymatic PET Hydrolysis
After the preliminary tests, P80A and F250A were used in subsequent experiments.
Enzyme loading for efficient conversion is an important parameter of enzymatic processes
such as PET hydrolysis. PET weight loss and monomer release reached a maximum
(24.4% weight loss, molar yield of 10.3, and 15% of TPA and MHET) when 0.5 mg g −1
PET FastPETase was used at 50 ◦C in potassium phosphate-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0) after
96 h (Figure 3a). Interestingly, the PET hydrolysis did not improve when the concentration
of FastPETase was increased to 1 and 2 mg g −1 PET. A recent study showed the low
thermostability of FastPETase during PET hydrolysis at different reactor scales compared
Polymers 2025, 17, 763 10 of 19
to other variants [2]. LCC on the other hand showed increased depolymerization of both
powder and film (Figure 3b) with an increase in enzyme loading, reaching a maximum
weight loss of 32% at a concentration of 1 mg g −1 PET. The performance of ICCG at
1 mg g−1 PET enzyme loading was superior where the depolymerization was approximately
58% and TPA and MHET molar yield of 55% and 7%, respectively. LCC ICCG has been
reported to convert 200 g L−1 amorphized PET to 90% over 10 h at 3 mg g−1 PET enzyme
loading [19]. Similar results were obtained by Brizendine et al. [33] when depolymerization
was performed at 65 ◦C and 100 g L −1 loading of PET film (1 × 1 cm) but in 48 h. The
amount of TPA compared to MHET also kept increasing (Figure 3c) with increased enzyme
loading. A possible explanation could be that the enzyme performs endo cleavage first
on the polymer, so at lower enzyme concentrations, more oligomers are released than
monomers or MHET is primarily released but then hydrolyzed further.

FastPETase was increased to 1 and 2 mg g−1 PET. A recent study showed the low thermo-
stability of FastPETase during PET hydrolysis at diﬀerent reactor scales compared to other 
variants [2]. LCC on the other hand showed increased depolymerization of both powder 
and ﬁlm (Figure 3b) with an increase in enzyme loading, reaching a maximum weight loss 
of 32% at a concentration of 1 mg g −1 PET. The performance of ICCG at 1 mg g −1 PET en-
zyme loading was superior where the depolymerization was approximately 58% and TPA 
and MHET molar yield of 55% and 7%, respectively. LCC
ICCG has been reported to convert 
200 g L−1 amorphized PET to 90% over 10 h at 3 mg g −1 PET enzyme loading [19]. Similar 
results were obtained by Brizendine et al. [33] when depolymerization was performed at 
65 °C and 100 g L−1 loading of PET ﬁlm (1 × 1 cm) but in 48 h. The amount of TPA compared 
to MHET also kept increasing (Figure 3c) with increased enzyme loading. A possible ex-
planation could be that the enzyme performs endo cleavage ﬁrst on the polymer, so at 
lower enzyme concentrations, more oligomers are released than monomers or MHET is 
primarily released but then hydrolyzed further.

0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg g−1 PET). It was incubated for 96 h at the respective optimum temperature of the 
enzymes, i.e., 50 °C (FastPETase), 65 °C (LCC), and LCCICCG (72 °C) without any pH control. Depol-

The eﬀect of using di ﬀerent buﬀers and pH for PET hydrolysis was investigated.

(2, 4, 8, 16, 24, 30, 36, 48, 60, 72, and 96 h) in 50 mM KH 2PO4-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0), 13 g L−1 PET
powder, or film.
The effect of using different buffers and pH for PET hydrolysis was investigated.
FastPETase (50 ◦C), LCC (65 ◦C), and LCCICCG (72 ◦C) treated PET exhibited weight loss in
all buffer solutions with a pH ranging from 6.5 to 11.0 (Figure S2a–c). The weight loss was
maximum in 50 mM potassium phosphate NaOH buffer (at pH 8.0) for all three enzymes
and efficient depolymerization in the pH range of 7.0–9.0. Also, PET powder depolymer-
ization was most efficient in 50 mM KH2PO4-NaOH buffer (pH 8.0 and 9.0) for FastPETase
Polymers 2025, 17, 763 11 of 19
(22%), LCC (31%) and LCC ICCG (58%). There was a rapid decline in depolymerization
efficiency as the pH dropped below 7.0 due to the release of acidic hydrolysis products
(TPA and MHET) which decreased the reaction mixture’s pH.
Interestingly, LCCICCG catalyzed PET hydrolysis produced more TPA than MHET
compared to LCC and FastPETase in the buffer conditions tested. Here, the lower molarity
(50 mM) was chosen to mimic the industrial reaction environments where hydrolysis
is performed in water rather than specialized buffered solutions to reduce operational
costs [2].
The temperature of incubation was also optimized for these enzymes (Figure S3a–c).
All these enzymes exhibited maximum depolymerization at their respective reported
optimum temperature, i.e., 50 ◦C, 65 ◦C, and 72 ◦C for FastPETase, LCC, and LCCICCG,
respectively [17–19] (Figure S3). As expected, the thermostability analysis suggested that
FastPETase is least stable in all tested temperatures (50, 60, and 72◦C) after 36 h followed by
LCC and LCCICCG (Figure S4). Furthermore, PET hydrolysis efficiency was monitored over
time. It can be seen from Figure 3d that FastPETase achieved maximum depolymerization
and molar yield (13.75% MHET and 8% TPA) in 33 h. The depolymerization process slowed
down after 36 h and no significant changes were observed after longer incubation times
(Figure 2c). This can be due to poor thermostability and short half-life of FastPETase,
changes in pH or a combination thereof [2]. LCC showed an improved depolymerization
performance (Figure 3e). The released monomer (for both powder and film) increased with
prolonged incubation time and molar yield of 26% and 24% of TPA and 14.5% and 13% of
MHET (P80A and F250A) in 60 h. LCCICCG also exhibited maximum depolymerization after
60 h (Figure 3f) but with a higher molar yield of TPA (54%) and less MHET (7%). The TPA
yield marginally increased to 56.5% after 72 h and remained constant after that. Brizendine
et al. [33] observed differences between the large-scale (bioreactor conditions) and small-
scale reactions for MHET concentrations where large-scale reactions generally built up less
MHET than small-scale ones. LCCICCG will preferentially release TPA due to the inhibitory
effect of MHET. The reactions can be complemented by adding a carboxylesterase or
MHETase to further improve the depolymerization efficiency [37,38].
3.4. PET Depolymerization in 10 mL
The previous experiments were performed on a 1 mL scale (50 mM phosphate-NaOH,
pH 8.0) without a constant pH control, which may have a significant effect on the overall
depolymerization of PET [ 2]. The first scale-up (10 mL) was performed in the reaction
conditions optimized earlier with P80A, F250A, and mixed PET waste MW1, and MW2
without any pH control. The overall depolymerization improved compared to the 1 mL
scale. The depolymerization of P80A, F250A, and mixed PET waste MW1 (XC 16%), and
MW2 (Xc 28%) by FastPETase led to a weight loss of 25, 24, 23, and 15%, respectively
(Figure 4a). LCC catalyzed depolymerization of PET reached 34% weight loss for F250A
and MW1, but only 22% weight loss for MW2. ICCG outperforms the other two in terms of
weight loss and monomer molar yield for all the substrates tested (Figure 4a). A weight loss
of 69, 68, 63, and 56% was recorded for the depolymerization of P80A, F250A, MW1, and
MW2, respectively. The release of TPA was maximum for LCCICCG followed by LCC and
FastPETase (Figure 2b). The interesting result is the depolymerization of MW2 (Xc = 28%)
by ICCG where 57% weight loss (molar yield of 43% TPA and 11% MHET) was achieved
compared to LCC (22% weight loss, 8.9% and 11.6% molar yield of TPA and MHET). There
is a difference in the observed weight loss of powders and the mass loss obtained from
molar yield due to the loss of powder particles during washing, processing, and analysis.
Thomsen et al. [31] demonstrated that LCCICCG performs relatively better than PETase at

the crystallinity was increased.

obtained from molar yield due to the loss of powder particles during washing, processing, 
and analysis. Thomsen et al. [31] demonstrated that LCC ICCG performs relatively be tter 
than PETase at higher crystallinity (15–25%); however, the depolymerization e ﬃciency 
was decreased as the crystallinity was increased.

volume containing 50 mM KH 2PO4-NaOH buﬀer (pH 8.0), 13 g L −1 PET powder, or ﬁlm or MW 1 
mg g−1 enzyme for 48 h at the respective optimum te mperature of the enzymes, i.e., 50 °C (FastPE-
Tase), 65 °C (LCC), and LCC ICCG (72 °C) without any pH control. ( b) The released monomers were 
measured by HPLC after the completion of the reaction and expressed as molar yield (%). 
3.5. Depolymerization of Diﬀerent PET Substrates Using Crude LCCICCG in a Bioreactor (1 L) 
In the PET hydrolytic process, pH is a crucial factor with a huge impact on the overall 
depolymerization. It signiﬁcantly aﬀects enzyme stability, activity, substrate binding, and 
product solubility. Consequently, the eﬃciency of PET hydrolases depends on the optimal 
pH conditions that support catalytic activity  and structural integrity. We performed de-
polymerization of di ﬀerent PET substrates (PET ﬁlm, Powder) in the 1 L reactor in the 
optimized conditions, i.e., 13 g L−1 substrate loading (PET ﬁlm or powder). The E. coli BL21 
cells containing LCC ICCG were grown in an M9 medium (0.1% ammonium chloride and 
0.5% glycerol, 20% pO2, pH 7.2). After induction with IPTG, the cells were grown for 32 h 
(Figure 5a). The ﬁnal OD600 of 5.7, total protein content in the supernatant of 119 mg L −1, 
and pNPB activity of 1232 U mg −1 were reached in the bioreactor. Similarly, a fed-batch 
fermentation (1 L) using LB medium or autoinduction medium with glucose feeding and 
IPTG induction led to the production of 12 g L−1 total protein (10–15% of the target protein 
LCC) [39] which is higher than the current stud y. However, it is to be noted that in the 
current study, the production of the enzy me was performed in a minimal medium and 
0.2% glycerol in a batch reactor. 30% of the total protein produced extracellularly accounts 
for LCCICCG. The enzyme cost during the PET hydrolysis is a key cost driver and a bal-
anced production process with lower costs and higher enzyme yields will be an advantage 
[22]. After removing cell debris, one-half of the supernatant (1 L) was used for puriﬁcation 
and the other half for the bioprocess using the crude enzyme. With the puriﬁed enzyme-
catalyzed reaction with ﬁlm F250A, MHET concentration reached a maximum molar yield 
of 13.1% after 19 h and decreased after that, whereas TPA formation reached the maxi-
mum of 94% molar yield in 72 h (Figure 5b) and was also veri ﬁed by quantitative NMR 
(Figure S5). However, almost 90% of TP A was released in 25 h showing the e ﬃciency of 
this enzyme. The molar yield of TPA (Figures 5c and S6) and powder using the crude 
supernatant reached 90% in approximately 46 h. However, MHET release was very low

MW 1 mg g−1 enzyme for 48 h at the respective optimum temperature of the enzymes, i.e., 50 ◦C
(FastPETase), 65 ◦C (LCC), and LCCICCG (72 ◦C) without any pH control. (b) The released monomers

3.5. Depolymerization of Different PET Substrates Using Crude LCCICCG in a Bioreactor (1 L)
In the PET hydrolytic process, pH is a crucial factor with a huge impact on the overall
depolymerization. It significantly affects enzyme stability, activity, substrate binding,
and product solubility. Consequently, the efficiency of PET hydrolases depends on the
optimal pH conditions that support catalytic activity and structural integrity. We performed
depolymerization of different PET substrates (PET film, Powder) in the 1 L reactor in the
optimized conditions, i.e., 13 g L −1 substrate loading (PET film or powder). The E. coli
BL21 cells containing LCCICCG were grown in an M9 medium (0.1% ammonium chloride
and 0.5% glycerol, 20% pO 2, pH 7.2). After induction with IPTG, the cells were grown
for 32 h (Figure 5a). The final OD600 of 5.7, total protein content in the supernatant of 119
mg L−1, and pNPB activity of 1232 U mg −1 were reached in the bioreactor. Similarly, a
fed-batch fermentation (1 L) using LB medium or autoinduction medium with glucose
feeding and IPTG induction led to the production of 12 g L −1 total protein (10–15% of
the target protein LCC) [ 39] which is higher than the current study. However, it is to
be noted that in the current study, the production of the enzyme was performed in a
minimal medium and 0.2% glycerol in a batch reactor. 30% of the total protein produced
extracellularly accounts for LCCICCG. The enzyme cost during the PET hydrolysis is a key
cost driver and a balanced production process with lower costs and higher enzyme yields
will be an advantage [22]. After removing cell debris, one-half of the supernatant (1 L) was
used for purification and the other half for the bioprocess using the crude enzyme. With
the purified enzyme-catalyzed reaction with film F250A, MHET concentration reached a
maximum molar yield of 13.1% after 19 h and decreased after that, whereas TPA formation
reached the maximum of 94% molar yield in 72 h (Figure 5b) and was also verified by
quantitative NMR (Figure S5). However, almost 90% of TPA was released in 25 h showing
the efficiency of this enzyme. The molar yield of TPA (Figures 5c and S6) and powder using
the crude supernatant reached 90% in approximately 46 h. However, MHET release was
very low compared to TPA. NMR spectrum revealed the presence of isophthalic acid and
some unknown aromatic compounds (Figures S5 and S6). Another interesting difference
is the lag phase during the initial hours (5–7 h) for PET film (using a purified enzyme
Polymers 2025, 17, 763 13 of 19
and crude supernatant) which was not evident for powder. Brizendine et al. [ 33] also
observed a lag phase 1 × 1 cm film which seemed to be dependent on the surface area
and enzyme concentration. It can be explained by the fact that the enzyme performs an
endo cleavage on PET which would not release monomers during the initial phase [31,33].
They also reported that PET particle size does not have an appreciable effect on total
depolymerization [33,40,41].

Currently, LCCICCG is among the best enzymes that depolymerize crystalline PET
(Xc < 20%) as efficiently as amorphous PET. However, the depolymerization activity
decreases sharply after the crystallinity is increased as observed in this work and re-
ported by others [ 31,42]. The quantitative NMR analysis of the MW1 and MW2 hy-
drolysate after 60 h revealed the presence of isophthalic acid, an unknown aromatic
compound, and oligomers of MHET and BHET, besides TPA and EG (Figures S10 and
S11). The spectrum showed predominant signals corresponding to TPA (~8.0 ppm) and EG
(4.2 ppm), indicating near-complete PET depolymerization. It reveals multiple intermediate
signals, including MHET (8.2 ppm, 2H and ~4.3 ppm, 2H), isophthalic acid (~8.3–8.4 ppm,
1H, 2H), diethylene glycol (~3.9 ppm, 4H), and unknown compounds (~7.8 ppm, 2H;
~3.8 ppm, 2H). Overall, the data demonstrate successful PET breakdown, with varying
degrees of intermediates’ accumulation. (Figures S10 and S11). TPA tends not to be very
soluble in the reaction mixture and will certainly affect the mixing and mass transfer.
However, it has been reported that the addition of NaOH neutralizes the acidic products
released during PET depolymerization. The base addition also leads to the formation of
Polymers 2025, 17, 763 15 of 19
soluble disodium terephthalate (13%w/w) between 25 and 70◦C [2,43]. The current process
runs at 100 g L−1 substrate loading (10%), so the process is well below these limits. If the
process is run at 20–30% solid loadings, the problem of solid mixing and mass transfer will
arise due to insoluble TPA. However, it can be alleviated using higher concentrations of
NaOH (to form TPA salt) and ensuring that TPA salt concentrations do not go beyond the
solubility limits. TPA, being an acidic compound, tends to precipitate out of the solution
at the pH and temperature conditions typically used during the reaction, especially when
the substrate loading is high. While NaOH addition is crucial for neutralizing TPA and
enhancing its solubility, it must be carefully controlled to avoid excess, which could lead
to salt precipitation or undesired changes in reaction conditions. This balance ensures
that TPA remains soluble, enabling efficient PET depolymerization even at higher solid
loadings. Recently, Chen et al. [ 44] expressed and secreted FastPETase in Pichia pastoris
and used crude supernatant to depolymerize 90% of 5 g L −1 PET (0.5%) in 18 h in a
10 L reactor. Similarly, LCC variants were produced inE. coli, and crude supernatant was
applied to degrade 10 g L−1 PET with 97.5% depolymerization [45]. Table S4 summarizes
recent studies on PET wastes at the bioreactor scale. However, in the current work, 90% de-
polymerization of 100 g L−1 PET (10%) mixed PET tray waste was achieved in a 1 L reactor.
This approach is particularly interesting for large-scale industrial applications, reducing
enzyme production costs while maintaining high degradation efficiency, thus making
enzymatic PET recycling more feasible and sustainable. However, microbial strains with
high expression and secretion ability would be highly beneficial for such processes to be
successful. Despite the high depolymerization efficiency of LCCICCG, substrate crystallinity
above 25% remains a significant limitation, slowing down the reaction and reducing overall
PET breakdown. Additionally, scaling up enzyme production and purification remains
a challenge, requiring optimization in high-expression hosts to lower costs and improve
industrial feasibility.

4. Conclusions
We evaluated the depolymerization efficiency of three efficient PET degrading en-
zymes namely FastPETase, LCC, and LCCICCG on different powder and films in several
conditions (enzyme loading, buffer, temperature, and time) on a small scale and concluded
that LCCICCG is the best-performing enzyme on amorphous and crystalline PET, and mixed
PET waste (tray and bottle waste). As reported earlier, the particle size does not affect the
overall depolymerization process. However, if crystallinity of the substrate exceeds 25%, it
becomes a bottleneck for efficient depolymerization. LCCICCG production was scaled to
2 L and a PET depolymerization of >90% was achieved in 50 h at 1.3% and 2.4% loading
of amorphous PET and postconsumer PET, respectively. Furthermore, 78% of 100 gL −1
MW1 (Xc = 16%) and 50% of MW2 (Xc = 28%) were depolymerized in 60 h showing the
effect of an increase in crystallinity on the depolymerization rate. Our study confirms that
LCCICCG outperforms FastPETase and LCC in PET depolymerization across various con-
ditions, achieving >90% degradation efficiency in small-scale and liter-scale experiments.
These findings provide a strong foundation for more robust and viable biotechnological
depolymerization of real PET waste, by developing a one-pot enzymatic production and
hydrolysis process, reducing purification costs, and thus laying the basis for enhanced
industrial PET recycling efficiency.
