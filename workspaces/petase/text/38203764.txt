Abstract: Plastic production has increased dramatically, leading to accumulated plastic waste in
the ocean. Marine plastics can be broken down into microplastics (<5 mm) by sunlight, machinery,
and pressure. The accumulation of microplastics in organisms and the release of plastic additives
can adversely affect the health of marine organisms. Biodegradation is one way to address plastic
pollution in an environmentally friendly manner. Marine microorganisms can be more adapted to
fluctuating environmental conditions such as salinity, temperature, pH, and pressure compared with
terrestrial microorganisms, providing new opportunities to address plastic pollution. Pseudomon-
adota (Proteobacteria), Bacteroidota (Bacteroidetes), Bacillota (Firmicutes), and Cyanobacteria were
frequently found on plastic biofilms and may degrade plastics. Currently, diverse plastic-degrading
bacteria are being isolated from marine environments such as offshore and deep oceanic waters,
especially Pseudomonas spp. Bacillus spp. Alcanivoras spp. and Actinomycetes. Some marine fungi
and algae have also been revealed as plastic degraders. In this review, we focused on the advances
in plastic biodegradation by marine microorganisms and their enzymes (esterase, cutinase, laccase,
etc.) involved in the process of biodegradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polystyrene (PS),
polyethylene (PE), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), and polypropylene (PP) and highlighted the need to
study plastic biodegradation in the deep sea.

1. Introduction
Plastic is an organic synthetic polymer material that is used worldwide. It has gradu-
ally replaced traditional materials such as wood, metal, and glass in a variety of applications
due to its low cost, durability and high strength compared to traditional materials [1–3].
Based on polymer demand in Europe, six common plastic polymers are polyethylene (PE),
29.8%; polypropylene (PP), 19.3%; polyvinyl chloride (PVC), 10.2%; polyurethane (PUR),
7.7%; polyethylene terephthalate (PET), 7.4%; and polystyrene (PS), 6.6% [ 4]. Currently,
plastic production is approximately 450 million metric tons per year globally [ 5]. Most
plastics are poorly managed and turn into plastic waste that enters the environment. The
global plastic waste production in 2022 was approximately 380 million tons [ 6]. Of this,
approximately 8 million tons of plastic waste was released into the ocean [7]. Therefore,
the accumulation of plastic waste in the ocean continues to increase [8].
Plastic products are usually highly stable for long-term use and can last for decades in
the environment [9], and they can be broken down into microplastics or even nanoplastics
using different processes (UV , thermal degradation, mechanical action and human activ-
ities, etc.) [10,11]. Microplastics in the ocean pose serious threats to marine ecosystems.

The accumulation of microplastics has been found in many marine organisms, such as
fish [12,13], oysters [14], and scallops [ 15], crossing various biological barriers to reach
organs and disrupting cellular metabolic activity. Nanomicroplastics are usually more elu-
sive, with higher threats leading to cellular oxidative stress and metabolic disorder [16,17].
These newly emerging pollutants are troublesome to marine ecological health. For example,
microplastics can hinder cyanobacterial growth by inhibiting photosynthesis [18,19] and
causing cell damage [20].
In addition, a variety of chemical additives that are added to plastics to alter their
properties, including plasticisers, flame retardants, ultraviolet stabilisers, and antioxidants,
also cause environmental threats [ 21,22]. Additives are poorly chemically bound and
released into seawater as the material degrades and weathers [23]. There are many types
of plasticisers, and phthalic acid esters (PAEs) are widely consumed, accounting for ap-
proximately 70% of the global plasticiser market [ 24,25]. In particular, di(2-ethylhexyl)
phthalate (DEHP) is often used as a plasticiser for PVC, accounting for 51% of global
phthalate consumption [26]. PAEs are classified as priority pollutants by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) due to their acute toxicity [27]; they are toxic to
aquatic animals and, more importantly, carcinogenic to humans [28]. Research on flame
retardants has focused on brominated flame retardants (BFRs) and organophosphorous
flame retardants (OPFRs). Brominated flame retardants have become the largest market
group due to their high performance and low cost [ 24], while organophosphorus flame
retardants are also growing at a rate of 4.6% per year [29]. It has been shown that flame
retardants can cause decreased immunity, metabolic disorders, and endocrine disruption in
marine organisms [30,31]. Bisphenol A (BPA) is commonly used as a stabiliser and antioxi-
dant for plastic and as a monomer for polycarbonate (PC) [32]. As a result, BPA is a widely
used chemical that is often detected in water. BPA can cause severe endocrine disruption in
marine organisms [33] and impair reproduction under prolonged exposure [34]. Therefore,
both microplastics and plastic additives impose threats to animals, plants, and microalgae
in marine ecosystems.
Several approaches have been applied for plastic waste treatment including incinera-
tion, chemical recycling, landfilling, and mechanical reprocessing [8]. As shown in Table 1,
incineration of plastic garbage has serious drawbacks, as toxic combustion products (e.g.,
hazardous dioxins) can be released and cause air pollution. The major problem of chemical
recycling however is its cost, and also the production of toxic products [35]. Landfill can
cause some environmental impact, such as releasing odorous components and greenhouse
gases or polluting the land and aquifer by releasing leachable components [36]. Mechan-
ical reprocessing requires pre-sorting and damages their mechanical performances [ 37].
Therefore, an effective and environment-friendly method to deal with the accumulation of
plastic waste is required.

Microbial depolymerisation and biodegradation is an alternative way to reduce plastic
waste in the environment by recycling and treating environmental waste in the future.
Plastic microbial degradation involves steps of biodeterioration, biofragmentation, assimi-
lation, and mineralisation [39] (Figure 1). In the first phase, microorganisms with plastic
degrading abilities attach to the plastic surface to form biofilms. In the second phase,
extracellular enzymes are secreted from the microbial biofilms, which convert long-chain
polymers into oligomers and oxidise them under the influence of oxygen to form carbonyl,
carboxyl, hydroxyl, and other oxygen-containing functional groups [40]. Next, oligomers
are assimilated through in vivo metabolism mechanisms (mostly β-oxidation mechanisms
and the citric acid cycle) by microorganisms. Finally, the oligomers are mineralised to form
CO2, CH4, and H2O [5,41]. Compared with other degradation processes, biodegradation is
a cost-effective and eco-friendly method. In this review, we focused on the biodegradation
of synthetic plastics by marine bacteria, fungi, and algae and the enzymes involved in this
process, which are important in attenuating plastic pollution in situ.

2. Bibliometric Study 
To understand the research trends in the present topic, a bibliometric study, based 
on data obtained from Web of Science (WoS), was carried out. A total of 2648 publications 
were obtained with the keyword “plastic biodegradation”. The annual production of pub-
lications is shown in Figure 2a; the number of articles showed little growth until 2006. The 
number of articles started to increase annu ally during 2007–2017. Since 2018, there has 
been a rapid increase in articles on plastic biodegradation. A total of 1703 articles, account-
ing for 64.3% of the outputs, were publis hed between January 2018 and December 2023. 
The increase in the number of published articles indicates that signi ﬁcant progress has 
been made in plastic biodegradation research in recent years. But the process of bioreme-
diation might have some process hindrances, as  factors like time for incubation, process 
of degradation have not been optimised. 
Figure 2b shows the countries collaboration network. China is the most active coun-
try in plastic biodegradation research. Chin ese researchers have published 526 papers, 
accounting for 19.86% of the total. The other countries on plastic biodegradation research 
are the United States, India, Japan, and Germany, accounting for 12.73%, 9.93%, 5.85%, 
and 5.62%, respectively. Due to rapid economic growth, the plastic consumption in devel-
oping countries is higher than the global aver age. According to stat istics, Asia’s global 
plastics production in 2021 was 390.7 million tons, and China has the highest contribution 
to plastic consumption [42]. Based on plas tic consumption and government support for 
plastic biodegradation research, the ranking seems reasonable.

3. Microbial Degradation of Plastics 
3.1. Bacteria 
Bacteria are noted to be the most import ant and abundant organisms in nature and 
can degrade plastics. In the last few years, plastic-degrading bacteria have been isolated 
from a wide range of habitats, such as marine, landﬁll, soil, and compost habitats [43]. 
3.1.1. Pseudomonas Species 
Currently, among the diﬀerent bacterial genera associated with plastic degradation, 
Pseudomonas spp. account for 21% [44]. The earliest microbial studies on plastic biodegra-
dation also started with Pseudomonas spp. [45]. Diﬀerent species of Pseudomonas spp. have 
been used for the degradation  of plastics. Among them, Pseudomonas aeruginosa has re-
ceived much attention and has been con ﬁrmed to degrade various plastics. P. aeruginosa 
isolated from the intestines of superworms showed daily weight loss of 0.64%, 0.098%, 
and 0.025% for PE, PS, and PP, respectively [46]. P. aeruginosa isolated from waste dumps 
showed polyethylene (PE) degradation rates of 6.5% and 8.7% after 60 days of incubation 
in minimal salt medium (MSM) and Bushnell–Haas broth (BHM), respectively [47]. P. ae-
ruginosa isolated from sewage water-contaminated surface soil incubated in nutrient broth 
(NB) medium for one month PP showed a weight loss of 5.37% [48]. Moreover, other spe-
cies of the Pseudomonas, such as Pseudomonas citronellolis  [49], Pseudomonas putida  [50], 
Pseudomonas alcaligenes [51], and Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens [52], have also been shown to de-
grade diﬀerent types of plastics. 
In the marine environment, Pseudomonas spp. have been widely detected on plastic 
bioﬁlms, but there have been fewer reports of their strains being isolated individually to 
degrade plastic compared with terrestrial sources [53,54]. Pseudomonas aestusnigri isolated 
from marine sand samples could e ﬀectively degrade PET with a novel carboxylic acid 
ester hydrolase [55,56]. Pseudomonas rhodesiae isolated from Brazilian deep-sea sediments 
could form bioﬁlms on high density polyethylene (H DPE) and cause structural changes 
in the plastic [57]. Microbial consortia formulated by P. putida and P. stutzeri isolated from 
Bangalore Lake could degrade low-density polyethylene (LDPE), which showed higher 
degradability and 90% weight loss after 40 days of incubation [58]. 
3.1.2. Bacillus Species 
Bacillus spp. can eﬀectively degrade diﬀerent types of plastics, represented by Bacillus 
cereus, Bacillus safensis, and Bacillus subtilis. For example, B. cereus isolated from mangroves 
in Peninsular Malaysia resulted in weight losses of 1.6%, 6.6%, and 7.4% for PE, PET, and 
PS, respectively, in 40 days [59]. B. subtilis H1584 isolated from pelagic waters degraded 
LDPE, which led to a weight loss of 1.75% in 30 days [60]. B. subtilis isolated from seawater 
0–30 cm depth showed a weight loss of 1.54% for LDPE after 90 days of incubation [61].

try in plastic biodegradation research. Chinese researchers have published 526 papers,

countries is higher than the global average. According to statistics, Asia’s global plastics
production in 2021 was 390.7 million tons, and China has the highest contribution to plastic

3. Microbial Degradation of Plastics
3.1. Bacteria
Bacteria are noted to be the most important and abundant organisms in nature and
can degrade plastics. In the last few years, plastic-degrading bacteria have been isolated
from a wide range of habitats, such as marine, landfill, soil, and compost habitats [43].
3.1.1. Pseudomonas Species
Currently, among the different bacterial genera associated with plastic degradation,
Pseudomonas spp. account for 21% [44]. The earliest microbial studies on plastic biodegra-
dation also started with Pseudomonas spp. [45]. Different species of Pseudomonas spp. have
been used for the degradation of plastics. Among them, Pseudomonas aeruginosa has re-
ceived much attention and has been confirmed to degrade various plastics. P . aeruginosa
isolated from the intestines of superworms showed daily weight loss of 0.64%, 0.098%,
and 0.025% for PE, PS, and PP , respectively [46]. P . aeruginosaisolated from waste dumps
showed polyethylene (PE) degradation rates of 6.5% and 8.7% after 60 days of incubation in
minimal salt medium (MSM) and Bushnell–Haas broth (BHM), respectively [47]. P . aerugi-
nosa isolated from sewage water-contaminated surface soil incubated in nutrient broth (NB)
medium for one month PP showed a weight loss of 5.37% [48]. Moreover, other species of
the Pseudomonas, such as Pseudomonas citronellolis [49], Pseudomonas putida [50], Pseudomonas
alcaligenes [51], and Pseudomonas fluorescens [52], have also been shown to degrade different
types of plastics.
In the marine environment, Pseudomonas spp. have been widely detected on plastic
biofilms, but there have been fewer reports of their strains being isolated individually to
degrade plastic compared with terrestrial sources [53,54]. Pseudomonas aestusnigri isolated
from marine sand samples could effectively degrade PET with a novel carboxylic acid
ester hydrolase [55,56]. Pseudomonas rhodesiae isolated from Brazilian deep-sea sediments
could form biofilms on high density polyethylene (HDPE) and cause structural changes
in the plastic [57]. Microbial consortia formulated by P . putidaand P . stutzeriisolated from
Bangalore Lake could degrade low-density polyethylene (LDPE), which showed higher
degradability and 90% weight loss after 40 days of incubation [58].
3.1.2. Bacillus Species
Bacillus spp. can effectively degrade different types of plastics, represented by Bacillus
cereus, Bacillus safensis, and Bacillus subtilis. For example, B. cereus isolated from mangroves
in Peninsular Malaysia resulted in weight losses of 1.6%, 6.6%, and 7.4% for PE, PET, and
PS, respectively, in 40 days [59]. B. subtilis H1584 isolated from pelagic waters degraded
LDPE, which led to a weight loss of 1.75% in 30 days [60]. B. subtilis isolated from seawater
0–30 cm depth showed a weight loss of 1.54% for LDPE after 90 days of incubation [ 61].
Bacillus paralicheniformis G1 isolated from deep-sea sediment was found to degrade PS by
approximately 18% in the first 30 days and reached 34% in 60 days [62].
By far, plastic-degrading Bacillus isolated from terrestrial environments are more
diverse; for example, B. cereus isolated from landfills showed a 1.78% degradation rate of
HDPE in 30 days [63], and the isolate of B. cereus from cattle manure caused a weight loss
of 5.9% HDPE in 83 days [64]. B. safensis from landfill soil caused 8% weight loss of PLA
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2024, 25, 593 5 of 25
1006 in 30 days [ 65]. Two strains of B. amyloliquefaciens (BSM-1) and B. amyloliquefaciens
(BSM-2) isolated from municipal solid soil showed 11% and 16% degradation rates of LDPE,
respectively, after 60 days of incubation [66].
3.1.3. Alcanivorax Species
Species within the genus Alcanivorax are widely distributed in the ocean and are
well-known hydrocarbon degraders [67]. Their recurrence in biofilms of marine plastics
also predicted their capacity to degrade plastics [ 68,69]. Alcanivora sp. 24 isolated from
marine plastic litter could reduce mass by 0.9% after 34 days of incubation with LDPE [70].
Alcanivorax borkumensis isolated from the Mediterranean Sea could form biofilms on LDPE,
with a significant weight loss of 3.5% after 80 days [71]. Alcanivorax wenustensis isolated
from the deep sea could degrade polycaprolactone (PCL) and make its surface rough [72].
Alcanivorax xenomutans isolated from mangroves could effectively degrade PS by observing
the amount of strain growth [73].
3.1.4. Actinomycetes
Currently, actinomycetes that degrade plastics are mainly isolated from soil [ 74].
However, some actinomycetes have also been isolated from marine environments that can
effectively degrade plastics. Kocuria palustris isolated from Arabian Sea seawater could
reduce PE weight by 1% after 75 days of incubation [60]. Rhodococcus ruber isolated from
mangrove sediment degraded PP with 6.4% weight loss after 40 days of incubation [75].
Rhodococcus pyridinivorans P23 isolated from deep-sea sediment could reduce the weight of
PET by 4.28% after five weeks of cultivation [76]. Nocardioides marinus isolated from Pacific
Ocean deep-sea sediments could reduce the weight of PET by 1.2–1.3% in 30 days [ 69].
Gordonia sihwensis, Gordonia mangrovi, and Gordonia bronchialis isolated from mangroves
showed PS degradability with 4.69–7.73% degradation rates in one month [73]. Srreptomyces
gougerotti, Micromonospora matsumotoense, and Nocardiopsis prasina isolated from the ocean
could degrade LDPE, PS, and polylactic acid (PLA) to varying degrees [77].
3.1.5. Other Bacterial Species
Many other bacterial species of Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria can de-
grade plastics. Lysinibacillus sp. JJY0216 isolated from soil grooves degraded 9% and 4% of
PE and PP , respectively, in 26 days [78]. Achromobacter denitrificans Eb113 laiyuandi showed
weight losses of 6.5% and 22.3% for LDPE and PVC, respectively, in one month [79]. Alcali-
genes faecalis (MK517568) degrades LLDPE by 3.5%, HDPE by 5.8%, and Polyester by 17.3%
after 40 days of incubation [80]. Meyerozyma guilliermondii and Serratia marcescens isolated
from the gut of wax worms showed PE weight losses of 13.9% and 3.57% within 60 days,
respectively [81]. Brevibacillus brevis from soil could degrade nylon 6, 6 microplastics with a
weight loss of approximately 22 w/w% after 35 days of incubation [82]. Acinetobacter bac-
terium isolated from larvae of Tribolium castaneum could degrade PS, causing 12.14% weight
loss after 60 days of incubation [83]. Marinobacter gudaonensis, Thalassospira xiamenensis, and
Marinobacter sedimimum isolated from Pacific Ocean deep-sea sediments could reduce the
weight of PET by 1.2–1.3% in 30 days [69].
3.2. Fungi
Fungi are important in environmental plastic degradation, as they move through
substrates with their filamentous network structure, exploring and growing in places
that are more difficult for other microorganisms to reach [84]. Previously, biodegradation
by fungi with polyesterase activities has been reported, which are solely terrestrial fungi.
Several marine plastic-degrading fungi have been isolated [85]. For example, the marine red
yeast Rhodotorula mucilaginosa isolated from plastic debris in the North Sea can efficiently
degrade PE using an isotopically labelled method [86]. Penicillum spp. isolated from the
Red Sea Coast could attach to LDPE films and grow in abundance [87]. The marine fungus
Alternaria alternata FB1, which was isolated from plastic debris, can degrade PE by forming
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2024, 25, 593 6 of 25
holes across the film [ 84]. Aspergillus sp. isolated from the Bay of Bengal could cause
22% weight loss of PE in six weeks [ 88]. Zalerion maritimum isolated from Portuguese
coastal waters was particularly active in degrading PE microplastics, with a mass change
of 56.7% in 14 days [89]. The marine fungus Cladosporium halotolerans 6UPA1 isolated from
deep-sea sediments can colonise PU foam and degrade plastic by secreting extracellular
materials [90]. To our knowledge, this is the only study on the deep-sea fungal degradation
of PU.
Some terrestrial Aspergillus, such as Aspergillus nomius RH06 [ 91] and Aspergillus
clavantus JASK1 [92], can degrade LDPE plastics, as evaluated by weight loss and variation
in morphology, such as cracks and fissures. Other fungal species of terrestrial origin
also have significant plastic degradability, including Trichoderma sp. [91,93], Monascus
sp. [94], Clitocybe sp. [95], Penicillum spp. [96], and Phanerochaete sp. [97]. Among them,
only Penicillum spp. and Aspergillus sp. of marine origin have been isolated [ 98], while
Trichoderma sp., Monascus sp., Clitocybe sp., and white-rot fungi of marine origins have yet
to be isolated.
3.3. Algae
To date, only a few algae cases have been reported on plastic degradation. Algae
adsorbed on the surface produces ligninolytic and exopolysaccharide enzymes to degrade
plastic [99]. The microalga Uronema africanum isolated from waste plastic bags in a fresh-
water lake was found to degrade LDPE sheets within 30 days through observations of
corrosion, abrasion, groove, and ridge configurations [ 100]. During the investigation,
cyanobacteria appeared on plastic biofilms, showing its potential to degrade plastic. Fewer
cyanobacteria have been isolated to degrade plastics. For example, Phormidium lucidum
and Oscillatoria subbrevis isolated from plastic debris in domestic wastewater were found
to be capable of degrading LDPE, as they colonised PE and utilised carbon without any
pro-oxidant additives or pre-treatment [101]. PET and PP can be degraded after 112 days
of interaction with freshwater Spirulina isolates, as confirmed by FTIR-ATR, SEM-EDX, and
tensile strength [102]. Plastic degradation by cyanobacteria isolated from marine sources
has not been reported. PETaseR280A-FLAG, produced by a marine diatom, showed the abil-
ity to degrade PET. This is the only known degradation of plastics by marine-sourced algae
and provides a foundation for later use of microalgae to solve the plastic problem [103].
4. Plastic Biodegradation Mechanisms
4.1. Biofilm Formation
Plastic debris foster a biofilm on its surface once it enters the water due to the large
number of microbial communities in the aquatic environment [ 104]. Biofilm formation
is a dynamic process that usually involves microbial adhesion, secretion of extracellular
polymeric substances, and microbial proliferation [105,106]. Microbial diversity in plastic
biofilms is strongly influenced by environmental factors [107]. The six most common fami-
lies on PS and PU plastic surfaces in the Northeast Atlantic are Chitinophagaceae, Xanthobac-
teraceae, Hyphomicrobiaceae, Pseudoalteromonadaceae, Opitutaceae, and Burkholderiaceae [108].
Flavobacteriaceae and Rhodobacteraceae were commonly found on biofilms of PP , PE, PET,
and PVC in the Fal Estuary [109]. In the Caribbean Sea at a depth of 1 m, scientists placed
various plastics (PS, PP , PET, PE, PVC) from consumer products in seawater for six weeks,
and the dominant community on the surface biofilms were Pirellulaceae, Flavobacteriaceae,
Rhodobacteraceae, and Saprospiraceae [110]. Flavobacteriaceae, Planctomucetaceae, and Colwelli-
aceae were found on the surface of PVC plastic biofilms in the Mediterranean Sea [ 111].
Community structure can vary in different locations of the same region. Different features
in the biofilm diversity of PP , PS, and PE were observed at three sites in the intertidal
zone of the Yangtze estuary. Erythrobacteraceae, Sphingomonadaceae, Comamonadaceae, no-
rank_c_Cyanobacteria, and Blastocatellaceae_Subgroup_4_ are predominant on Chongming
Island [112]. Rhodobacteraceae, Erythrobacteraceae, Moraxellaceae, FamilyI_o_SubsectionIII, and
Planococcaceae were observed in the Lvsi port, and the most frequent families included

norank_c_Cyanobacteria, Saprospiraceae, Pseudoalteromonadaceae, Flavobacteriaceae, and Ery-
throbacteraceae in Xiangshan Bay [112]. The bacterial diversity in plastic biofilms of different
marine environments is summarised in Table 2.

4.2. Enzymes
Enzymatic biocatalysis is crucial in the biodegradation of plastics and offers a green
alternative for plastic recycling [ 125]. Enzymes are involved in the biodegradation of
plastics by first being adsorbed on the film surface with the help of the surface binding
domain, and then breaking the chemical bond. Among them, PET-degrading enzymes
have been most intensively investigated. In 2005, it was first reported that hydrolases
isolated from the actinomycete Thermobifida fusca could reduce weight by 50% after three
weeks of incubation [ 126]. Since then, a series of PET-degrading enzymes have been
characterised, mostly including carboxylic ester hydrolases (cutinases, carboxylesterase,
and lipases), PETase, and MHETase [125,127]. Among them, PETase and cutinases have
received extensive attention. The PET hydrolase named PETase was discovered from
Ideonella sakaiensis in 2016 and has optimal degradation activity at 40 ◦C [41]. To improve
the depolymerisation ability, several methods (chemical modification, PET pre-treatment,
protein engineering, etc.) have been used to improve the stability and activity of PET
hydrolases. The best variant, DepoPETase, was screened by directed evolution that can
produce 1407-fold products towards amorphous PET film at 50 ◦C and showed a 23.3 ◦C
higher Tm value than the original PETase [128]. The activity and thermostability of PETase
from I. sakaiensis were enhanced by modulating post-translation glycan modification, which
can completely depolymerise untreated PET plastic within 2–3 days at 50 ◦C [129].
Numerous cutinases have been identified that can also degrade PET. In 2012, PET-
degrading cutinase (LCC) was isolated from leaf-branch compost with the highest activity
at pH 8.5 and 50 ◦C [130]. Subsequently, the more thermally stable enzyme can degrade
at least 90% of the PET within 10 h by replacing the divalent metal binding site with
a disulphide bridge [ 131]. Another study showed that two fusion proteins constructed
by a carbohydrate-binding module and leaf-branch compost cutinase could increase the
degradation efficiency of PET films by 3.7% and 24.2%, respectively [132].
Esterase is the main class of enzymes for PU degradation. In 1998, the PUR esterase
isolated from Comamonas acidovorans TB-35 could adsorb to the PUR surface to hydrolyse its
ester bonds. The optimum pH of this enzyme was 6.5, and the optimum temperature was
45 ◦C [133]. Subsequently, the polyurethanase isolated fromPseudomonas spp. (Pseudomonas
fluorescens, Pseudomonas chlororaphis, and Pseudomonas sp. AKS31) was shown to be involved
in PU degradation [134–136]. PE, PS, PP , and PVC are extremely difficult to degrade because
of the C-C backbone compared to PET and PU, which contain hydrolysable bonds [137].
To date, studies on the characterisation of specific enzymes for PE, PS, PP , and PVC are
relatively scarce. Peroxidase, laccase, manganese superoxide dismutase, and alkane hydrox-
ylase were reported to be involved in the oxidation and depolymerisation of PE [138,139].
For example, laccase from the Antarctic sea Psychrobacter sp. NJ228 can reduce the mass
by 13.2% after 24 h incubation at 30 ◦C [140]. Similarly, oxidoreductases, laccase, and
lipase are involved in the PS degradation pathway. In 1997, the degradation of polystyrene
by hydroquinone peroxidase isolated from Azotobacter beijerinckii HM121 was first re-
ported [141]. Alkane hydroxylases and monooxygenases were found to break C-C bonds;
ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases may break PS side chains to produce aromatic ring com-
pounds, and they are potential enzymes for PS depolymerisation [142]. The key enzymes

responsible for plastic biodegradation and the corresponding metabolic products are sum-
marised in Table 3.

4.3. Biodegradation Mechanisms of Specific Plastics
4.3.1. PS Biodegradation Mechanism
Polystyrene (PS), which is an aromatic polymer composed of styrene monomers,
was first extracted from natural resins by German Eduard Simon in 1839 and has been
commercially produced since 1930 [152,153]. The structure of PS can thus be written as
[CH2CH (C6H5)] n, and it is a rigid, amorphous thermoplastic polymer [154]. To improve
specific properties, PS polymers can be chemically modified with other polymers, such as
styrene acrylonitrile (SAN) and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS). PS is widely used to
produce CDs, toys, food storage, and various packing products due to its high translucency,
durability, low cost, etc. According to the latest report, the global production of polystyrene
(PS) reached 20.82 million tons in 2022 (https://www.plasticseurope.org/en, accessed on
28 December 2023), but the unique structure of PS, with aromatic rings in its polymer
chain, causes its biodegradation to be very difficult [155]. Therefore, PS biodegradation has
become a critical global environmental issue.
Although many studies have demonstrated the biodegradation of PS by various mi-
croorganisms, the critical enzymes involved in the initial depolymerisation have not been
reported [156,157]. Microbial degradation of styrene monomers has been well studied
(Figure 3), including two potential metabolic pathways, the styrene cis-glycol–3-vinylcatechol
and styrene oxide–phenylacetaldehyde pathways [158,159]. The first is that styrene is hy-
droxylated by styrene dioxygenase (SDO) on the aromatic ring to generate styrene cis-glycol,
which can be further converted to acetyl-CoA by cis-glycol dehydrogenase (CGDH), catechol
2,3-dioxygenase (CDO), 2-hydroxymuconic acid semialdehyde hydrolase (HMASALDH),
2-hydroxypenta-2,4-dienoate hydratase (HPDEH), 4-hydroxy-2-oxovalerate aldolase (HOA),
and the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC), which then enter the TCA cycle. The
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2024, 25, 593 10 of 25
second one was converted into styrene oxide by styrene monooxygenase (SMO). Styrene ox-
ide is then degraded by styrene oxide isomerase (SOI) to form phenylacetaldehyde. Finally,
the product was degraded into 4-maleylaceloacetate by henylacetaldehyde dehydroge-
nase (PAALDH), phenylacetate hydroxylase (PAAH), 2-hydroxyphenylacetate hydroxylase
(HPAAH), and homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (HGADO), which was further converted
to acetyl-CoA through the β-oxidation pathway. The styrene oxide-phenylacetaldehyde
metabolic pathway has been validated for the degradation of polystyrene by larvae of
the greater wax month, and another metabolic pathway has also been proposed [3]. An-
other potential metabolic pathway was that polystyrene produces PS oligomers, which
then produce 4-methylphenol. 4-Methylphenol can be converted to benzoyl CoA by
4-methylphenol methylhydroxylase (MPMH), 4-hydroxybenzyl alcohol dehydrogenase
(HBADH), 4-hydroxybenzaldehydedehydrogenase (HBALDH), 4-hydroxybenzoic acid-
CoA ligase (HBACAL), and 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA reductase (HBCAD). Through the
β-oxidation pathway, benzoyl CoA is further converted to acetyl-CoA and then enters the
TCA cycle for complete mineralisation. Several studies have demonstrated that PS degrada-
tion produces the monomer styrene [160,161]. Moreover, a novel approach to the recycling
of polystyrene was reported in which styrene is converted to polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA)
by Pseudomonas putida CA-3 [162], which offers the possibility to solve the pollution of PS
in the environment.

(HGADO), which was further converted to acetyl-CoA through the β-oxidation pathway. 
The styrene oxide-phenylacetaldehyde metabolic pathway has been validated for the deg-
radation of polystyrene by larvae of the greater wax month, and another metabolic path-
way has also been proposed [3]. Another po tential metabolic pathway was that polysty-
rene produces PS oligomers, which then produce 4-methylphenol. 4-Methylphenol can be 
converted to benzoyl CoA by 4-methylph enol methylhydroxylase (MPMH), 4-hy-
droxybenzyl alcohol dehydrogenase (HBADH), 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde dehydrogenase 
(HBALDH), 4-hydroxybenzoic acid-CoA ligase (HBACAL), and 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA 
reductase (HBCAD). Through the β-oxidation pathway, benzoyl CoA is further converted 
to acetyl-CoA and then enters the TCA cycle for complete mineralisation. Several studies 
have demonstrated that PS degradation produces the monomer styrene [160,161]. More-
over, a novel approach to the recycling of polystyrene was reported in which styrene is 
converted to polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) by Pseudomonas putida CA-3 [162], which oﬀers 
the possibility to solve the pollution of PS in the environment.

4.3.2. PET Biodegradation
PET is a condensation of terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG) [ 163].
The first patent for preparing PET was published in 1946, and it achieved worldwide
industrial production in 1953. With the development of material science, PET is one of
the most common synthetic polymers in every aspect of our life due to it being colourless
(transparent or translucent), lightweight, thermoplastic, robust, semirigid to rigid, and low
toxicity [84]. The fibre and packaging industries, such as plastic bags, bottles, and films,
are the industries with the largest PET in-use stocks [164,165]. However, the treatment of
waste PET will be a challenge in the future due to consumption and disposal.
The depolymerisation of PET begins with the cleavage of ester bonds by PETase to
produce ethylene glycol (EG), MHET, and BHET. As shown in Figure 4, BHET is converted
to MHET by PETase, which is further converted to terephthalic acid (TPA) and EG [166].
TPA is eventually degraded into succinyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA by TPA-1,2-dioxygenase
(TPADO), 1,2-dihydroxy-3,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-dicarboxylate dehydrogenase (TphB), pro-
tocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase (PCDO), β-carboxy-cis, cis-muconate lactonizing enzyme
(CMLE), β-carboxymuconolactone decarboxylase (CMD), enollactone hydrolase (ELH), β-
ketoadipate:succinyl-CoA transferase (TR), and β-ketoadipyl-CoA thiolase (TH). Similarly,
EG can be further converted to acetyl-CoA by quinoprotein alcohol dehydrogenase (PedH),
aldehyde dehydrogenase family protein (PedI), glycolate oxidase (GlcDEF), glyoxylate
carboligase (Gcl), hydroxypyruvate isomerase (Hyi), tartronate semialdehyde reductase
(GlxR), glycerate kinase (TtuD), enolase (Enol), pyruvate kinase (PykF), and pyruvate de-
hydrogenase complex (PDHC). The products of metabolism, succinyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA,
enter the TCA cycle to provide energy for growth. In addition, the monomers gener-
ated from PET can be upgraded to higher-value chemicals and materials. For example,
Pseudomonas putida GO16 could utilise terephthalic acid (TPA) to produce biodegradable
polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) and hydroxyalkanoyloxy-alkanoate (HAA) [167,168]. PET
hydrolysate can be used by Rhodococcus josii for growth and conversion to lycopene [169].

4.3.3. Polythene (PE) Biodegradation Mechanism
Polyethylene (PE), expressed as (C 2H4) n, is a linear hydrocarbon polymer that is
hydrophobic in nature [ 70]. It is also considered one of the most recalcitrant carbon-
based synthetic materials [35]. Several properties of PE, such as high molecular weight,
ductility, corrosion resistance, and durability, have caused it to be the preferred material
worldwide. PE can be divided into high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and low-density
polyethylene (LDPE) according to the polymerisation method, molecular weight, and
chain structure. High-density polyethylene (HDPE), of which 1 kg can be produced by
using 1.75 kg petroleum, has a high degree of crystallinity and has been produced since
1939 [171,172], and the polymer chain may be 500,000–1,000,000 carbon units long with
little or no branching [173]. HDPE is widely used in toys, packaging, and medical supplies
due to its advantages. Compared with HDPE, LDPE has a high degree of branching
and low crystallinity (55–65%) and is used for films, packing, wrapping frozen food, and
textile products.

Figure 4. The metabolic pathways of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics.
There are two major stages regarding PE biodegradation. The first stage is depoly-
merisation. Some enzymes, including laccase [ 140] and peroxidase [ 84], are pivotal for
PE degradation. They are mainly involved in depolymerising the long carbon chains of
polyethylene into oligomers, dimers, and sometimes monomer mixtures [ 2,174], which
can re-participate in the chemical cycle of the natural environment or oligomers with
10–50 carbon atoms that are available for transportation into microorganism cells and can
be further assimilated in metabolic pathways [ 137]. Hydroxylation is the first step for
alkane assimilation [70]. As shown in Figure 5, the alkanes produced by depolymerisation
could be hydroxylated by terminal oxidation monooxygenase and subterminal oxidation
monooxygenase. The terminal hydroxylated alkanes eventually form fatty acids by alcohol
dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase. Furthermore, the subterminal hydroxylated
alkanes are converted to esters by a Baeyer–Villiger monooxygenase and further degraded
by esterase or lipase to produce fatty acids. All fatty acids produced by both pathways
enter ß-oxidation to produce acetyl-CoA and finally enter the TCA cycle to complete the
mineralisation process.

4.3.4. Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC) Biodegradation Mechanism
PVC is a white, amorphous vinyl polymer composed of repeating ethynyls with the
chemical formula C2H3Cl. It is also an inert and rigid polymer that was discovered in
1872 by the German chemist Eugen Baumann, but the first patent was received by Klatte
in 1913. Due to low material costs and cost-effectiveness, it has been widely used for a
variety of applications, such as food packaging, construction, water pipes, and electrical
cable insulation [175]. China produces and consumes the largest amount of PVC material
worldwide. It is estimated that the cumulative PVC waste in China will be 508.6 Mt by the
end of 2050 [176].
PVC may lead to various environmental pollutants different from other plastics, as it
is a kind of chlorine-containing plastic. Various additives, such as phthalates, carboxylates,
epoxides, and polyesters, are added for durability and corrosion resistance [ 177]. Most
of these additives are toxic and can be emitted to the surroundings, which has raised
particular concerns.
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2024, 25, 593 14 of 25
Microbial degradation of PVC has been observed. For example, the bacterial con-
sortia enriched from the Tenebrio molitor larvae gut can degrade PVC polymers [178,179].
The strain Klebsiella sp. EMBL-1 isolated from the gut of insects can depolymerise PVC
for further use as the sole energy source [ 180]. Vibrio, Altermonas, and Cobetia can cause
changes in PVC morphology and chemical structure [181]. However, the mechanism of
PVC biodegradation is poorly understood because it has no hydrolysable ester bond, which
causes its degradation to be more difficult. As shown in Figure 6. Catalase-peroxidase pro-
motes the degradation of depolymerised PVC into lower molecular weight polymers [180].
Lower molecular weight polymers are transformed into fatty acids by monooxygenase,
esterase, dioxygenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase, and dihydroxy-acid dehydratase. Fatty
acids are converted to acetyl-CoA by the β-oxidation pathway and then enter the TCA
cycle to provide energy for growth. PVC has also been found to produce HCl as well as
other chlorinated compounds in the presence of dehalogenases [40,179].

4.3.5. Polyurethane (PU) Biodegradation Mechanism 
Polyurethanes are synthetic polymers that  carry urethane (or carbamate) bonds (-
NH-COO-) in their main chains [183]. The bond is formed by step-growth polymerisation 
through the condensation of polyisocyanate and short- or long-chain polyols [184,185]. 
The most commonly used isocyanate is 4,4 ′-methylene diphenyl isocyanate (MDI), fol-
lowed by aliphatic isocyanates [186]. The global PU market is expected to grow at a com-
pound annual growth rate of 3.8% from 2021 to 2028 [187]. Polyurethanes are highly re-
sistant to high temperature and hydrophobic, resulting in a long service life [188]. The 
hardness and elasticity of polyurethanes can be tailored by controlling the ratio of each, 
causing them to be widely used [189]. Flexible PU is a very good material widely used in 
packing and ﬁltering [190]. Because of its nontoxicity and ability to support cell adhesion 
and proliferation of human cells, PU has been widely applied in the ﬁeld of biomedical 
materials such as tissue engineering, breast  surgery, and drug delivery carriers [191]. 
Rigid PU retains many of its merits, such as  heat insulation, corrosion resistance, and 
sound insulation, and it has many application areas, including construction, automobiles, 
and aviation. 
Currently, bacteria and fungi can biodegrade PU mainly through the hydrolysis of 
ester bonds by polyesterases [192]. Serratia sp. HY-72 isolated from the gut of the Asian 
mantis can degrade PU (polyester- and polyether-PU), causing changes in the PU surface

4.3.5. Polyurethane (PU) Biodegradation Mechanism
Polyurethanes are synthetic polymers that carry urethane (or carbamate) bonds (-NH-
COO-) in their main chains [ 183]. The bond is formed by step-growth polymerisation
through the condensation of polyisocyanate and short- or long-chain polyols [184,185]. The
most commonly used isocyanate is 4,4′-methylene diphenyl isocyanate (MDI), followed
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2024, 25, 593 15 of 25
by aliphatic isocyanates [186]. The global PU market is expected to grow at a compound
annual growth rate of 3.8% from 2021 to 2028 [ 187]. Polyurethanes are highly resistant
to high temperature and hydrophobic, resulting in a long service life [188]. The hardness
and elasticity of polyurethanes can be tailored by controlling the ratio of each, causing
them to be widely used [189]. Flexible PU is a very good material widely used in packing
and filtering [ 190]. Because of its nontoxicity and ability to support cell adhesion and
proliferation of human cells, PU has been widely applied in the field of biomedical materials
such as tissue engineering, breast surgery, and drug delivery carriers [191]. Rigid PU retains
many of its merits, such as heat insulation, corrosion resistance, and sound insulation, and
it has many application areas, including construction, automobiles, and aviation.
Currently, bacteria and fungi can biodegrade PU mainly through the hydrolysis of
ester bonds by polyesterases [192]. Serratia sp. HY-72 isolated from the gut of the Asian
mantis can degrade PU (polyester- and polyether-PU), causing changes in the PU surface
morphology and structure [193]. B. subtilis MZA-75 and P . aeruginosaMZA-85 isolated from
soil in the form of a consortium produce large amounts of esterase to degrade PU [ 192].
However, it is generally believed that bacteria are less effective in degradation than fungi
in PU hydrolysis. Fungal strains Cladosporium sp., Rhizopus oryzae, and Alternaria alternate
were verified to degrade PU [90,194,195]. The structural diversity of PU leads to a variety
of metabolites and metabolic pathways. As shown in Figure 7, polyesterases, urethanase,
and peroxidases attack the ester and urea bonds of PU for depolymerisation, producing
alkanes, 4,4′-methylenedianiline (MDA) and polyols, which are further degraded to acid
by hydrolases, dioxygenases, and dienoate hydrolase. The intermediates of PU eventually
enter the fatty acid metabolic pathway and the TCA cycle to achieve complete metabolism.

4.3.6. Polypropylene (PP) Biodegradation Mechanism 
Polypropylene (PP) was ﬁrst condensed by propylene in 1954, and its production has 
gradually increased since the 1980s. At presen t, it is the second largest thermoplastic 
worldwide [196]. PP, expressed as (C3H6) n, is white waxy, transparent, and light and is a 
linear hydrocarbon resin, rigid crystalline ther moplastic, highly stable, and takes a long 
time to degrade. Owing to its advantageous characteristics, including low cost and den-
sity, it is one of the most widely used polymers present in everyday objects such as med-
ical instruments, automobiles, biomedical supplies, energy supplies, machine parts, and 
electronic packaging [197]. In recent years, the rapid development of packaging, electron-
ics, automobiles and other industries has greatly promoted the development of China’s 
industry. Moreover, with the aim of inhibiti ng the rapid spread of COVID-19, personal 
protection equipment, such as  ventilators, hair, and shoe nets, is used by healthcare

4.3.6. Polypropylene (PP) Biodegradation Mechanism
Polypropylene (PP) was first condensed by propylene in 1954, and its production has
gradually increased since the 1980s. At present, it is the second largest thermoplastic world-
wide [196]. PP , expressed as (C3H6) n, is white waxy, transparent, and light and is a linear
hydrocarbon resin, rigid crystalline thermoplastic, highly stable, and takes a long time to
degrade. Owing to its advantageous characteristics, including low cost and density, it is one
of the most widely used polymers present in everyday objects such as medical instruments,
automobiles, biomedical supplies, energy supplies, machine parts, and electronic packag-
ing [197]. In recent years, the rapid development of packaging, electronics, automobiles
and other industries has greatly promoted the development of China’s industry. Moreover,
with the aim of inhibiting the rapid spread of COVID-19, personal protection equipment,
such as ventilators, hair, and shoe nets, is used by healthcare professionals, mainly made
up of PP , at approximately 72% [198]. Therefore, the degradation of polypropylene is a
difficult task.
According to previous studies, the degradation mechanism of PP is similar to that
of PE, i.e., the polymer is converted to oligomers by increased oxygenated functional
groups, chain scission, and subsequent methyl ketones [4]. However, there are no enzymes
obtained that can degrade PP efficiently, and little has been reported about the mechanism
of PP degradation.
In the marine environment, the degradation efficiency of plastics can differ due to mi-
crobial species and numbers, temperature, dissolved oxygen, etc. For example,Pseudomonas
spp. isolated from seawater in Toyama Bay (320 m depth) can degrade PCL at 4 ◦C [199].
Brevibacillus thermoruber isolated from Bulgarian hot spring degrades PCL at 55 ◦C, with a
weight loss of 19.8% over four weeks [200]. Four marine communities can degrade PVC
in anaerobic conditions with 5.77–11.67% weight loss [201]. Microorganisms can degrade
different types of plastics in different environments. However, to our knowledge, the
biodegradation mechanisms of PET, PE, PP , PS, PVC, and PU are basically identical and are
initiated by oxidation.
5. Summary and Prospects
Plastic products provide comfort and convenience in daily life, but marine pollution
caused by plastics has adverse environmental, social, and economic impacts. Biodegrada-
tion is one of the environmentally friendly solutions for plastic pollution, but the process
is very slow. And the special ecological environment of the oceans (high salt, anaerobic,
high pressure, etc.) is beneficial for finding new microbial resources to increase the plas-
tic biodegradation rate. Pseudomonadota (Proteobacteria), Bacteroidota (Bacteroidetes),
Bacillota (Firmicutes), and Cyanobacteria are widely found on marine plastic biofilms. To
date, diverse plastic-degrading bacteria have been isolated from marine environments such
as offshore and deep oceanic waters. In contrast, only a few marine fungi and algae have
been isolated as plastic degraders. We also summarised the biodegradation mechanisms of
different types of plastics, especially the associated enzymes such as cutinases, esterases,
and laccases, and highlighted the necessity of exploring novel enzymes from both marine
microbial resources and biotechnology to promote the process. Considering the accumula-
tion of plastic in various marine environments and the challenges (such as low degradation
efficiency, limited understanding of degradation mechanisms, limited mineralisation ca-
pacity, and environmental factors, etc.) in understanding the environmental fates in the
vast ocean ecosystem, the plastic biodegradation and fragmentation mediated by marine
organisms need more investigation.
(1) The microplastics and nanoplastics resulting from the biodegradation of plas-
tics should be considered. Although plastics can be degraded by microorganisms, they
remain in a transitional state in the form of microplastics and nanoplastics for long pe-
riods before complete mineralisation. Therefore, the contribution of marine microorgan-
isms to microplastic production during plastic colonisation and biodegradation needs to
be evaluated.
Int. J. Mol. Sci. 2024, 25, 593 17 of 25
(2) The effects of environmental factors (mechanical, temperature, pH, etc.) on mi-
crobial degradation should be considered to mimic the in situ degradation process, such
as incorporated studies of sunlit water surfaces, cold, dark, deep-sea water columns,
and sediments.
(3) Hydrocarbon-biodegrading bacteria are widely distributed in the ocean, and their
potential for plastic degradation should be assessed. A relatively high percentage of marine
plastic-degrading bacteria are associated with hydrocarbon degradation [ 114,118,202],
and degradation mechanisms may be widely shared among pathways of the two kinds
of molecules.
(4) More efforts are needed to explore extreme marine environments for novel micro-
bial resources to address plastic pollution. The pelagic deep sea may provide a unique
habitat for plastic-eating microbes, with immense novel diversity to be revealed, and offer
opportunities to obtain unique enzymes for plastic waste recycling use. Deep-sea in situ
enrichment can be carried out to excavate bacteria with plastic-degrading potential.
