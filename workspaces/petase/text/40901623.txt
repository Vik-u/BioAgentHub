catalyst for sustainable polyester plastic recycling
Mei Li,†ab Yawen Shi,†a Lei Tang,*c Na Ji *a and Shengbo Zhang *a
The escalating global challenge of plastic waste calls for innovative recycling solutions that overcome the
high energy requirements of traditional chemical recycling and the ineﬃciency of enzymatic methods.
Here, inspired by the structure of Salen-based molecular catalysts and the hydrolase-mediated
degradation mechanism of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), we report a multifunctional Zn-Salen
molecular catalyst identiﬁed through theoretical screening and experimental validation. This catalyst
achieves high PET conversion e ﬃciency under mild conditions with low energy consumption.
Mechanistic investigations reveal that its Zn metal site and quaternary ammonium component
synergistically promote adsorption, activation, and nucleophilic attack towards the O–C]O group in
PET via a proximity eﬀect, mimicking key features of PET hydrolases. Notably, the synthetic catalyst
demonstrates high resistance to external interference, achieving an industrially viable productivity of 75
g
TPA L−1 h−1 at COH− = 0.1 M and T = 90 °C. This catalyst is also eﬀective for diverse substrates,
including real-world PET waste, mixed plastics containing PET, and biodegradable PLA. Techno-
economic and environmental analyses indicate that this recycling system can signiﬁcantly reduce carbon
emissions and has potential commercial value.
Introduction
The exponential growth of plastic production since the 1950s
has led to widespread contamination of ecosystems, causing
signicant environmental harm.
1–6 Among various plastics,
poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) stands out as the most widely
produced polyester, accounting for approximately 12% of global
solid waste.
7–9 While mechanical recycling methods o en
degrade PET's material properties,10,11 chemical recycling oﬀers
the advantage of restoring its original functionality. However,
chemical recycling typically requires extreme conditions,
including high temperatures, pressures, and corrosive reagents,
resulting in high energy consumption and hazardous waste
generation (Fig. 1a).
10,12 These limitations underscore the
urgent need for innovative recycling methods that combine
eﬃciency with environmental sustainability.
Enzymatic PET depolymerization has emerged as a prom-
ising alternative, oﬀering the potential to recycle plastic waste
under mild, environmentally friendly conditions.
13–18 Enzymes
such as PETases and cutinases can break down PET into its
monomers-terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG)-at
moderate temperatures and neutral pH. However, despite
substantial advances in enzyme engineering, these methods are
still hindered by low conversion eﬃciency and sensitivity to
external factors such as temperature, pH, and the presence of
additives.
10,19,20 These limitations signi cantly restrict their
scalability and practical application. Consequently, there is an
urgent need to develop strategies that address the energy-
intensive nature of chemical recycling while overcoming the
eﬃciency and robustness challenges of enzymatic
depolymerization.
A key mechanism underlying enzymatic PET degradation is
the proximity e ﬀect,
17,21–24 where active-site residues bring
reactive groups into close contact, increasing their local
concentration. For example, N-containing heterocycles (Lewis
acid sites) in the enzyme interact with the carbonyl oxygen of
PET, facilitating nucleophilic attack by hydroxyl groups and
cleavage of ester bonds (Fig. 1b). While this mechanism oﬀers
valuable insights for synthetic catalyst design, directly
mimicking the complex enzyme active sites is challenging due
to their precise and complex structure. Fortunately, some
metallohydrolases, especially binuclear metallohydrolases, also
exhibit similar catalytic mechanismsvia a proximity eﬀects.
24
To further simplify the structure of these hydrolytic enzymes,
recently, we have demonstrated this proximity e ﬀect using
a binuclear zinc synthetic catalyst to increase the local
concentration of alkali and PET.

metal sites can easily hinder substrate adsorption and lead to
metal leaching issues. To overcome this, we focused on other
multifunctional Salen-based metal complexes, known for their
structural tunability, stability, and biomimetic properties.
27–30
These complexes, particularly those incorporating quaternary
ammonium salts or organic bases, eﬀectively accelerate reac-
tions like epoxide ring-opening through synergistic interactions
between the metal Lewis acid site and the nucleophilic base
site.
29,31–34 This mechanism, which enhances local concentra-
tion and stabilizes intermediates, suggests that Salen-based
catalysts can potentially catalyze PET degradationvia a prox-
imity eﬀect (Fig. 1c), oﬀering a new, sustainable approach to
plastic recycling.
To test this hypothesis (Fig. 1c), we synthesized a Robson-
type Zn-Salen molecular catalyst with quaternary ammonium
salt component through theoretical screening. Remarkably, the
multifunctional Zn-Salen catalyst can eﬃciently depolymerize
real-world post-consumer PET plastic wastes with high-
crystallinity under mild conditions (C
OH− # 0.1 M;T # 90 °C).
Mechanistic investigations indicate that the e ﬃcient PET
depolymerization over this Zn-Salen catalyst originates from the
synergistic eﬀect of Zn metal site and quaternary ammonium
component via a proximity eﬀect, exactly matching the char-
acteristics of PET hydrolases. This synthetic Zn-Salen catalyst
remains robust over a wide range of operational temperature
(30–350 °C) and pH (8–13). As a result, a productivity of 75 g
TPA
L−1 h−1 was realized for sustainable PET recycling atCOH− =
0.1 M and 90 °C. Besides, this synthetic catalyst is catalytically
active toward a wide scope of substrates due to its high toler-
ance to various additives and impurities, including real-world
waste PET products, PET-containing mixed plastics, and
mainstream biodegradable PLA plastic. Techno-economic
analysis shows that processing 100 thousand tons of waste
PET plastic annually can generate a prot of 31 million USD and
reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 230 thousand tons. This
work will open up a new opportunity for the molecular design of
articial enzymes to better cope with the global waste plastic
challenge.

Results
Theoretical calculation-assisted catalyst screening and
characterization
To design a suitable Robson-type Salen molecular catalyst with
a relatively high reaction activity, a key factor should be
considered: a lower adsorption energy for PET molecules may
be relatively advantageous for the activation and cleavage of the
ester group in the PET molecule.
26,35 Therefore, we rst con-
ducted density functional theory (DFT) calculations to screen
a series of multifunctional Salen-based molecular catalysts with
diﬀerent metal centers (M = Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Mn) and
substituent functional groups (R= –NO
2, –Br, –Cl, –H, –CH3,
–tBu) (Fig. 2a and S1). The relationship between adsorption
energy and catalyst structure is shown in Fig. 2b and c. Gener-
ally speaking, metal Zn has the best catalytic activity in polyester
hydrolysis reaction compared to other metal centers. 24–26
Therefore, when examining diﬀerent substituents, we prefer-
entially chose metal Zn as the catalytic site. As shown in Fig. 2b,
tert-butyl ( –
tBu) as substituent is most favorable for the
adsorption of PET molecule, which may be related to the
stronger electron-donating capacity of –
tBu. The DFT results
also indicate that the adsorption energy stability across metal
centers follows the order: Zn (−0.67 eV) > Cu (−0.54 eV) > Co
(−0.52 eV) > Ni (−0.50 eV) > Mn (−0.49 eV) > Fe (−0.24 eV)
(Fig. 2c). This trend suggests that Zn-based catalysts exhibit the
most stable adsorption, consistent with the Lewis acid strength
of the metal ions. The stronger Lewis acidity of Zn enhances the
binding and activation of the carbonyl groups in PET molecules.
Based on thesendings, the Zn-Salen molecular catalyst (Zn-
Salen), with Zn as the metal center and–
tBu as the substit-
uent, demonstrates the highest adsorption capacity for PET
(Fig. 2d).
Guided by these theoretical insights, the optimal Robson-
type Zn-Salen molecular catalyst with quaternary ammonium
salt component was synthesized following established proce-
dures (Fig. S2).
30,36 For the convenience of subsequent catalyst
separation and recycling, we further loaded Zn-Salen molecular
catalyst on carbon black nanoparticles (Zn-Salen/C) based on
the p–p interaction between the phenyl group in Zn-Salen and
the sp2 carbon domain in the carbon black nanoparticles
support (Fig. 3a and b). The transmission electron microscopy
(TEM) images indicated that the material was composed of
carbon black nanoparticles with size dimension of ∼30 nm
(Fig. 3c). The high-resolution TEM (HR-TEM) image shows no
obvious metal or metal oxide nanoparticles in the catalyst
(Fig. 3c). More intuitively, aberration-corrected high-angle
annular dark-eld scanning transmission electron microscopy
(AC-HAADF-STEM) image also shows that white bright spots
(Fig. 3d) uniformly distributed on the carbon support, which
can be assigned as single Zn sites. The energy dispersive X-ray
spectrometry (EDS) mapping analysis reveals that Zn element
is uniformly distributed on the carbon black nanoparticles
(Fig. 3e and f). These above results indicate that the Zn-Salen
retained molecular structural form without aggregation or
decomposition.
The oxidation state and more precise local coordination
environment of Zn sites in Zn-Salen/C were also investigated by

X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). X-ray absorption near-edge
structure (XANES) spectroscopy revealed that the Zn K-edge of
Zn-Salen/C shied to higher energy compared to that of Zn foil
and ZnO (Fig. 4a), suggesting a higher oxidation state of Zn sites
in Zn-Salen/C than the references, which will favor the adsorp-
tion and activation of the ester carbonyl group in PET

molecules. The coordination environment of the zinc sites in
Zn-Salen/C was analyzed by Fourier transformed extended X-ray
absorption ne structure (EXAFS). EXAFS shows that the zinc
sites in Zn-Salen/C are coordinated to N/O atoms (1.5 Å) at the
rst coordination shell without forming Zn–Zn bond (2.3 Å)
(Fig. 4b). The Zn–O/N coordination is more intuitively reected
from the wavelet transform (WT) analysis of the EXAFS data for
Zn-Salen/C (Fig. 4c). The highest WT intensity is located in lobes
centered at 4.5 Å
−1 in k-space and 1.5 Å in R-space, corre-
sponding to the N/O atoms around zinc site. Furthermore, the
EXAFS spectrum matches well with the Zn-Salen molecular
tting model (Fig. 4d and S3), demonstrating that the Zn-Salen
molecules retained their oxidation state and local coordination
environment aer being loaded onto carbon support.
PET depolymerization under mild conditions
The catalytic eﬃciency of the as-prepared Zn-Salen/C catalyst
for hydrolyzing PET into monomers terephthalic acid (TPA) and
ethylene glycol (EG) (Fig. 5a) was evaluated under mild
conditions (pH 8, 60 °C) using high-crystalline PET (38%) as the
substrate. As shown in Fig. 5b and c, the Zn-Salen/C catalyst
achieved complete depolymerization of high-crystalline PET
within 30 days. In comparison, both the blank experiment and
the conventional hydrolysis catalyst, zinc acetate (Zn(OAc)
2),
exhibited negligible activity under the same conditions.
Notably, traditional alkali hydrolysis typically requires harsher
conditions, including higher alkali concentrations. A blank
experiment at pH 9 further demonstrated that Zn-Salen/C at pH
8 exhibited sevenfold higher catalytic activity, underscoring its
unique eﬃciency in breaking down chemically inert high-
crystalline PET under mild conditions.
To further evaluate the performance of Zn-Salen/C, it was
compared to the commercially available PET-degrading enzyme
Humicola insolens cutinase(HiC). It should be pointed out that
commercial HiC has relatively high degradation activity for
polyester (not the most eﬀective enzyme), but HiC was selected
as the benchmark due to its wide availability in the laboratory
and relatively heat-resistant and acid–base stable structure than
PETases. The comparison was also conducted at pH 8 and 60 °C,

an optimal condition for the commercial HiC. As shown in
Fig. 5d and S4, HiC showed higher initial activity for amorphous
PET (am-PET, from Goodfellow) with a specic activity of 0.038
mgPET h−1 mgcatal
−1 than that of Zn-Salen/C. However, as the
reaction time prolongs, HiC gradually becomes inactive (∼40%
conversion), while Zn-Salen/C can achieve complete conversion
of PET. Moreover, Zn-Salen/C exhibited comparable activity for
high-crystalline PET, whereas HiC was nearly inactive for this
substrate (Fig. 5b and S4). This highlights Zn-Salen/C's superior
ability to degrade real-world, high-crystalline waste PET
plastics.
Biological enzymes typically have strict operational require-
ments, such as specic temperature, pH, and ion concentra-
tions, which limit their practical applications. To investigate the
anti-interference ability of Zn-Salen catalyst to external envi-
ronment, a wider range of temperature and pH parameters are
adjusted for PET hydrolysis. Obviously, the Zn-Salen catalyst
exhibits diﬀerent degrees of catalytic activity over the entire
temperature (30–90 °C) and pH (8–12) range, and the catalytic
activity gradually increases with the increase of temperature
and pH (Fig. 5e). Thermal stability tests (TGA) conrmed that
Zn-Salen/C remains stable up to 350 °C (Fig. 5f). In addition,
PET depolymerization was conducted in natural seawater to
assess resistance to marine environmental interference,
including complex salts. Zn-Salen/C exhibited catalytic activity
an order of magnitude higher than commercial HiC (Fig. 5g),
demonstrating superior anti-interference capability. These
ndings establish that the Zn-Salen molecular catalyst oﬀers
a broader operating range, higher stability, and greater practical
application potential than existing PET-degrading enzymes.
Real-world polyester plastic waste processing
Given the broad operational range of the Zn-Salen/C catalyst, we
investigated its performance in scalable PET recycling at pH 13
and 90 °C. As shown in Fig. 6a, Zn-Salen/C achieved a PET
conversion rate ve times higher than the blank experiment
(without catalyst). The catalyst delivered an industrially relevant
space-time yield (STY) of 75 g
TPA L−1 h−1 (Fig. 6b), out-
performing other hydrolysis processes, including enzyme-
catalyzed PET hydrolysis (maximum STY: 16.7 g
TPA L−1 h−1),
our previously reported binuclear zinc catalyst (50–70 gTPA L−1
h−1),25 and traditional alkaline hydrolysis (maximum STY: 51.3
gTPA L−1 h−1), which typically requires 90–150 °C in 1–5M
alkaline solutions with phase transfer catalysts (PTCs) (Fig. 6b).
Catalyst reusability, a critical factor for industrial applications,
was also assessed. Zn-Salen/C exhibited a∼30% decrease in
yield aer ve reuse cycles (Fig. 6c), primarily due to catalyst
mass loss and Zn leaching duringltration recovery. Inductively
coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES)
revealed a cumulative Zn loss of 9.6% over ve cycles
(Fig. 6d), which corresponded to the activity reduction. Future
work should focus on optimizing the catalyst structure to
enhance stability and minimize leaching. Nevertheless, AC-
HAADF-STEM and wavelet transform analysis of the EXAFS
data for Zn-Salen/C aer reaction show that the remaining zinc
is still uniformly distributed on the carbon carrier in the atomic
state (Fig. S5).
As a further step towards real-world applications, we
submitted the Zn-Salen/C catalyst to diﬀerent PET feedstocks.
As illustrated in Fig. 6e, the conversion of PET components all
exceeded 70% for PET-containing waste textiles (polyester/
cotton clothing), and PET-containing physical mixed plastics
including polyvinylchloride (PVC), polystyrene (PS), poly-
propylene (PP), acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) plastic,
and polyethylene (PE). These results highlight the catalyst's
capability to process real-world mixed plastic waste eﬀectively.
In addition, Zn-Salen/C exhibited high catalytic activity for
biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) plastics (Fig. 6f). This
versatility contrasts with the specicity limitations of plastic-
degrading enzymes, which are oen ineﬀective for substrates
beyond PET.
37–39 Finally, the catalyst was applied to post-
consumer PET and PLA products with high crystallinity and
complex compositions, such as dyed bottles, clothingbers,
children's toys, towels, PLA bags, and PLA pipettes. Conversion
rates for these materials ranged from 68% to 88% (Fig. 6g),
demonstrating the Zn-Salen/C system's robustness and anti-
interference capability for real-world polyester waste recycling.
Closed-loop PET recycling
To demonstrate a closed-loop PET recycling, we also recovered
TPA monomer product from post-consumer waste PET bottle
with a 50 g handling capacity (solids content of 16.7 wt% and
PET/catalyst ratio of 500 g
PET gcatal
−1) at pH 13 and 90 °C. Aer
the reaction, catalyst was recycled for reuse by vacuumltra-
tion. Then, pure terephthalic acid (TPA) was obtained by acid-
ication, ltration, washing and drying process (Fig. 7a). Test
analysis found that the recovered TPA (Fig. 7b) have a high
purity as conrmed by
1H and13C nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR) and FT-IR spectrum (Fig. 7c, d and S6, S7). However,
according to TPA quality testing (Table S1), the purity of recy-
cled TPA still needs to be improved (such as multiple washings,
adsorption, etc.) to meet bottle-grade standards. Going one step
further, the recovered TPA was used as a raw material to make
recycled PET (rPET). The parameter characteristics of the rPET
shows that rPET was similar to those of PET made from virgin
PTA (Fig. 7e). Based on this biomimetic catalytic system, we also
performed a tentative techno-economic analysis (TEA) to eval-
uate the market prot and loss situation. The processing costs
mainly include equipment depreciation, utilities, labor, main-
tenance, PET waste, alkali and acid, and the revenue comes
mainly from TPA, EG and Na
2SO4. TEA shows that processing
100 thousand tons of PET plastic waste per year could generate
a net prot of US$31.0 million (Fig. 7f and Table S2), signi-
cantly higher than the traditional alkaline hydrolysis process at
1.0 M NaOH (US$8.2 million) with the presence of phase
transfer catalysts (PTCs) (Fig. S8 and Table S3), which indicates
that this biomimetic catalytic system has potential commercial
value.
Furthermore, the positive environmental impact of this
biomimetic catalytic system was also evaluated. Calculations
estimated that if 100 thousand tons of PET waste were landlled

or incinerated, approximately 230 thousand tons of CO2 will be
emitted into the atmosphere each year, which will accelerate the
global “greenhouse eﬀect”. In marked contrast, using this
biomimetic catalytic system not only has the potential to
generate signi cant commercial value, but also leads to
a signicant reduction in CO
2 emissions (0 tonsvs. 230 thou-
sand tons). These results indicate that this biomimetic catalytic
system could signicantly reduce carbon emissions and have
potential commercial value.
Catalytic mechanism
To explore the unique catalytic activity of this synthetic catalyst,
we rst proposed a possible biomimetic catalytic process based
on the enzymatic PET depolymerization mechanism. As shown
in Fig. 8a, some key steps are involved during PET depolymer-
ization, mainly including catalyst adsorption on the PET plastic
surface, metal Zn sites coordinating with O atom in the C]O
group of PET molecule and activating C]O bond, nucleophilic
groups attacking the C atom in the C]O group and promoting
C–O bond cleavage, and desorption of monomer products.
To verify the correctness of this mechanism, werst inves-
tigated the adsorption of carbonyl group using diﬀuse reection
infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS). With the
presence of the Zn-Salen, the carbonyl stretch presented a red
shi from 1719 cm
−1 to 1699 cm−1 (Fig. 8b). It suggests a bond-
weakening eﬀect on the carbonyl group upon coordination to
Zn site, whereby the electrophilicity of the substrate is
enhanced,
40–43 which is consistent with the results of XPS
(Fig. 8c). EXAFS revealed that the coordination number of Zn
did increase when ester was introduced (Fig. 8d), further con-
rming the coordination between ester carbon group and metal
Zn site.

To demonstrate the cleavage of C–O bonds and the desorp-
tion behavior of monomer products, Fourier transformed
infrared (FT-IR) and liquid
1H NMR were performed during the
PET depolymerization. As shown in Fig. 8e, the C]O groups
and C–O groups of PET plastic gradually disappeared, while C]
O, C –O and –COOH groups of TPA monomer gradually
appeared with increasing reaction time, indicating the cleavage
of C–O bonds and the generation of monomers. Further liquid
1H NMR analysis showed that two peaks at∼7.78 and ∼3.57
corresponded to monomer TPA-2Na and EG (Fig. 8f), respec-
tively, and the areas of the two peaks increased signicantly
with increasing depolymerization time. These results indicate
that the monomer products immediately desorbed from the
PET plastic surface or on catalytic site and entered the solution
aer depolymerization.
To gain further insights into the synergistic eﬀect of the Zn
site and quaternary ammonium component in Zn-Salen
molecular catalyst during PET depolymerization, we also per-
formed a series of control experiments and density functional
theory (DFT) calculations. As shown in the Fig. 8g, h and S9
control experiments with various catalyst congurations (Zn-
Salen* without the quaternary ammonium component, pure
quaternary ammonium salt (butyltrimethylammonium
bromide, BTAB), and Zn-Salen * + BTAB physically mixed
components) show that Zn-Salen molecular catalyst with the
quaternary ammonium component exhibits signicantly high
catalytic activity, conrming that the synergistic interaction
between Zn sites and the quaternary ammonium component is
critical for nucleophilic activation. Potential energy calculations
demonstrated that the Zn site stably binds to the carbonyl group

of PET (Fig. S10). The proximity e ﬀect of the quaternary
ammonium component further enhances nucleophilic attack
by hydroxyl groups, promoting C–O bond cleavage. Aer C–O
bond cleavage, the active site becomes temporarily coordinated
by the resulting carboxylate and is restoredvia ligand exchange
with hydroxide. DFT calculations also revealed that monomer
desorption is the most endothermic step, with energy barriers
of 0.57 eV for TPA-2Na and 0.84 eV for EG. Whereas in the actual

reaction, due to the presence of temperature and stirring
dynamics, the monomer products with high water solubility are
very susceptible to desorption from the PET plastic surface or
on catalytic site into aqueous solution, as conrmed by the FT-
IR and
1H NMR results (Fig. 8e and f). The calculated potential
energy proles indicate that the whole process is energetically
feasible under the reaction conditions. These results also indi-
cate that the synergistic eﬀect of Zn metal site and quaternary
ammonium component in Zn-Salen enhance adsorption, acti-
vation and nucleophilic attack processes towards the O–C]O
groups in PET molecule via a proximity e ﬀect (Fig. 8i),
mimicking the functional characteristics of PET
hydrolases.

Discussion
In summary, we designed a Zn-Salen molecular catalyst for
polyester depolymerization. Mechanistic studies reveal that the
proximity eﬀect between Zn metal site and quaternary ammo-
nium component increases the local substrate concentration at
the active site and accelerates the adsorption, activation and
nucleophilic attack processes towards the O–C]O group in
PET, exactly matching the characteristics of PET hydrolases.
Due to high resistance to external interference, this synthetic
catalyst provides an industrially feasible productivity of 75 g
TPA
L−1 h−1 for centralized PET recycling atCOH− = 0.1 M andT =
90 °C. We further demonstrated the compatibility of this
synthetic catalyst with complex mixtures in plastic waste and its
wide substrate scope. Techno-economic analysis and environ-
mental assessment shows that this biomimetic catalytic system
can signicantly increase net prots and reduce carbon emis-
sions. Considering that the structure of the reported Zn-Salen
complex can be further tailored in many ways, future work
should focus on the structure design of enzyme-mimicking
catalyst to improve structural stability. For example, changing
the coordination environment around the metal Zn site can
enhance its binding ability and prevent Zn loss. Alternatively,
homogeneous Zn-Salen complexes can be polymerized into
heterogeneous polymers or covalent organic frameworks
(COFs), which not only have a structure closer to that of
enzymes but also facilitate better catalyst recovery. We expect
that this work will be the starting point for the development of
more eﬃcient enzyme-mimicking catalysts for plastic recycling.
