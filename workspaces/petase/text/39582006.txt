Abstract 
Background Depolymerizing polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics using enzymes, such as PETase, offers a sus-
tainable chemical recycling route. To enhance degradation, many groups have sought to engineer PETase for faster 
catalysis on PET and elevated stability. Considerably less effort has been focused toward expressing large quantities 
of the enzyme, which is necessary for large-scale application and widespread use. In this work, we evaluated several 
E. coli strains for their potential to produce soluble, folded, and active IsPETase, and moved the production to a bench-
top bioreactor. As PETase is known to require disulfide bonds to be functional, we screened several disulfide-bond 
promoting strains of E. coli to produce IsPETase, FAST-PETase and Hot-PETase.
Results We found expression in SHuffle T7 Express results in higher active expression of IsPETase compared 
to standard E. coli production strains such as BL21(DE3), reaching a purified titer of 20 mg enzyme per L of culture 
from shake flasks using 2xLB medium. We characterized purified IsPETase on 4-nitrophenyl acetate and PET micro-
plastics, showing the enzyme produced in the disulfide-bond promoting host has high activity. Using a complex 
medium with glycerol and a controlled bioreactor, IsPETase titer reached 104 mg per L for a 46-h culture. FAST-PETase 
was found to be produced at similar levels in BL21(DE3) or SHuffle T7 Express, with purified production reaching 
65 mg per L culture when made in BL21(DE3). Hot-PETase titers were greatest in BL21(DE3) reaching 77 mg per L 
culture.
Conclusions We provide protein expression methods to produce three important PETase variants. Importantly, 
for IsPETase, changing expression host, medium optimization and movement to a bioreactor resulted in a 50-fold 
improvement in production amount with a per cell dry weight productivity of 0.45  mgPETase  gCDW
−1  h−1, which is ten-
fold greater than that for K. pastoris. We show that the benefit of using SHuffle T7 Express for expression only extends 
to IsPETase, with FAST-PETase and Hot-PETase better produced and purified from BL21(DE3), which is unexpected 
given the number of cysteines present. This work represents a systematic evaluation of protein expression and purifi-
cation conditions for PETase variants to permit further study of these important enzymes.

Background
More than 370 million metric tons of plastic are pro -
duced worldwide each year with approximately 10% of it 
being polyethylene terephthalate (PET) [1, 2]. Plastics are 
versatile, inexpensive, lightweight, strong, and durable 
with wide use in packaging, consumer products, build -
ing and construction materials, and textiles. Many plastic 
products have short functional lifetimes, such as PET in 
water bottles and food packaging, which is often single 
use. The properties of plastics also make their remedia -
tion challenging due to long natural decay times, leading 
to estimates of 12,000 million metric tons in landfills and 
the environment by 2050 [2]. Creating a circular economy 
for plastics [1] as well as breaking down current plastic 
waste is paramount to avoiding such high accumulation.
Enzymatic hydrolysis of plastics has emerged over 
the past 20 years as a promising strategy to break down 
plastics into monomers that can be resynthesized into 
high quality plastics [3, 4]. Enzyme-based conversion is 
advantageous over mechanical and traditional chemi -
cal recycling as reactions take place at low temperature 
and in water; however, turnover is slow and often incom -
plete. While esterases, specifically cutinases, have shown 
activity on plastics, the discovery of a naturally-evolved 
enzyme [5], called Is PETase, ushered in a new wave of 
research due to its higher propensity to act upon PET, 
earning its own enzyme classification number: 3.1.1.101. 
While IsPETase is active on real PET substrates, its 
low catalytic rate and moderate thermostability have 
prompted numerous engineering efforts to improve its 
properties to make it more industrially useful [3]. In par -
ticular, two variants, FAST-PETase [6] and Hot-PETase 
[7], have become widely used. FAST-PETase combined 
previously engineered PETase variants with machine 
learning to develop an enzyme that breaks down plastic 
in under a week [6]. Hot-PETase resulted from numerous 
rounds of directed evolution and enzyme activity screen -
ing at elevated temperatures as well as rational design to 
produce an enzyme with substantially improved ther -
mostability and performance on plastics [7]. Compara -
tive performance has revealed the advantages of evolved 
enzymes, yet  unfortunately, low conversions (< 20%) are 
still observed at bioreactor-scale conditions for reactions 
with PETases [8].
While enzyme engineering and evaluation of reactor 
conditions, including substrate processing and proper -
ties, have received much attention [8, 9], considerably 
less effort has been given to sourcing the PETase enzyme. 
Techno-economic analysis has found enzyme cost to 
account for approximately 4% of total plastic recycling 
cost [10, 11]; however, cost per kilogram enzyme were 
estimated using production values similar to that of cel -
lulases, which have yet to be realized for recombinant 
enzymes such as PETase and can vary widely [12]. Addi -
tionally, scanning the literature reveals a wide array of 
protein production strategies for PETases, including dif -
fering organisms, strains, genetic sequences and expres -
sion strategies. Most reports which produce and study 
PETases do not list the enzyme titers achieved. Develop -
ing a standard production method at a moderate scale for 
IsPETase and variants serves to benefit researchers work-
ing with this class of enzymes as they move from protein 
engineering and characterization studies requiring small 
quantities of protein to process development and scale-
up requiring more protein for larger reactor studies that 
better predict performance at an industrial scale [8].
E. coli remains a common expression host for recom -
binant proteins, including IsPETase and variants. Many 
studies use the gene for Is PETase encoded with its native 
signal peptide that can be sourced from Addgene (# 
112202) combined with the E. coli strain C41(DE3) for 
expression [13]. Using this strategy and 2-YT medium, 
purified production amounts of 15 mg IsPETase per liter 
culture were achieved [14]. Secretion of recombinant 
proteins is beneficial for downstream processing and 
native IsPETase is secreted from Ideonella sakaiensis [5], 
potentially making it a strong candidate for extracellular 
production. Secretion from E. coli and Bacillus subtilis 
for IsPETase and variants have been explored using dif -
ferent signal sequences and promoters; however, most 
report titers below 15  mg per liter [15–18]. The most 
successful prokaryotic secretion method used an aprE 
signal sequence and protease-knockout strain of B. sub -
tilis, finding Is PETase titers reaching 80  mg per liter as 
determined by activity in the supernatant [19]. High-den-
sity fermentations of Komagataella pastoris (previously 
Pichia pastoris) combined with secretion and glycosyla -
tion have proven the most successful for Is PETase pro-
duction, reaching 1.2  g per liter as measured by total 
protein in the supernatant [20]. Using a similar strategy, 
researchers secreted FAST-PETase from K. pastoris using 
high-density fermentations and intracellular chaperones 
to achieve a titer of 3.23 g enzyme per liter culture [21].
Our approach to increasing PETase production amount 
involved screening E. coli expression hosts, specifically 
those designed to promote disulfide bond formation in 
the cytoplasm. PETase contains four cysteine residues, 
which are expected to form two disulfide bonds. The 
disulfide between C203 and C239 is interesting since it 
is evolutionarily distinct from other cutinases that have 
activity on PET, it is near the active site, and it has been 
shown to be required for activity [22, 23]. Additionally, 
PETase is naturally secreted from the Gram-negative 
I. sakaiensis [5], likely using the general secretory path -
way to arrive in the oxidizing periplasm, which would 
permit disulfide bonds to form properly. RosettaGami B

Carter et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2024) 23:319 
 
has an oxidizing cytoplasm due to mutations to gor and 
trxB (termed Origami) as well as contains a plasmid that 
encodes rare tRNAs and a T7 RNA polymerase (RNAP) 
gene under control of a lacUV5 promoter. SHuffle has 
a similar set of mutations to gor and trxB to promote 
disulfide bond formation as well as a cytoplasmic copy of 
the chaperone disulfide bond isomerase (dsbC ), which is 
naturally used to rearrange misconnected disulfides [24]. 
Similar to RosettaGami B, SHuffle T7 Express has a T7 
RNAP gene to permit use with ubiquitous pET plasmid 
series for high level expression; however, the T7 RNAP 
gene has been inserted in place of lacZ and as such 
is under the control of the lac promoter. Others have 
used Origami or SHuffle T7 Express for production of 
IsPETase [25] and variants, but few report amounts pro -
duced. A mutant PETase was produced with chaperones 
and autoinduction media in SHuffle T7 Express at 80 mg 
per liter as measured by activity in lysate. Hot-PETase 
was found to be made and purified at 12 mg per liter and 
110 mg per liter when produced from SHuffle T7 Express 
[9] and Origami II [7] cells, respectively.
To better understand the impact of a reducing or oxi -
dizing cytoplasm, we measured the soluble production 
of IsPETase and variants FAST-PETase and Hot-PETase 
in several E. coli strains. Comparisons were made to 
other strategies that have been used to make PETase in 
E. coli. Media optimization and culturing in a controlled 
benchtop bioreactor was performed for Is PETase to fur-
ther elevate production. Few studies have moved SHuf -
fle T7 Express to even the benchtop bioreactor scale 
[26–29], representing an important step to utilizing this 
strain that has shown promise in making proteins with 
multiple disulfides. We also provide characterization 
of the enzymes using the soluble, colorimetric esterase 
substrate 4-nitrophenyl acetate (4-NPA) as well as PET 
microparticles to show the enzymes produced using our 
methods have similar activity to those made elsewhere. 
Taken together, this study represents an important stand-
ardization for the soluble production of PETase enzymes 
using common E. coli strains, which benefits both labo -
ratory researchers and those working to transition enzy -
matic recycling to an industrial scale.
Methods
Plasmid construction and strains
The gene encoding PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis 
(IsPETase) was codon optimized for expression in E. coli 
without its 26 base pair signal sequence as was done pre -
viously [5] (Supplemental Information). The gene was 
added to a pET21b or pET24a plasmid between ndeI and 
xhoI cutsites, which appends the protein with a C-termi -
nal hexa-histidine tag. Traditional restriction enzyme-
based cloning followed by ligation were used to generate 
all plasmids (all supplies from NEB). Assembled plasmids 
were transformed into DH5α chemically competent E. 
coli cells for plasmid amplification and cryogenic stor -
age at -80  ºC in 15% (v/v) glycerol. After plasmid DNA 
isolation (Zymo), Sanger or whole-plasmid sequenc -
ing was performed to verify assembly (Azenta). Genes 
encoding FAST-PETase (S121E, D186H, R224Q, N233K, 
R280A) [6] and Hot-PETase (S58A, S61V, R90T, K95N, 
Q119K, S121E, M154G, P181V, Q182M, D186H, S207R, 
N212K, S213E, S214Y, R224L, N233C, N241C, K252M, 
T270Q, R280A, S282C) [7] were synthesized as gBlocks 
(IDT) with identical codons as wild-type Is PETase used 
in this study, except internal ncoI, bsaI, and sphI sites 
were removed with synonymous codons (Supplemen -
tal Information). Note, all numbering for PETase amino 
acids used in this paper is based on the primary sequence 
with the signal peptide as this is what is commonly used 
in the literature; to determine the amino acid number 
for the proteins in this study, subtract 26. Genes were 
added between ndeI and xhoI sites of pET21b. Select 
plasmids from this study are available upon request from 
Addgene. Additionally, pET21b( +)-Is-PETase with a sig -
nal sequence was purchased from Addgene (# 112202) 
and pGro7 from Takara.
After sequence verification, isolated plasmids were 
transformed into chemically competent BL21(DE3) 
(Novagen), Rosetta Gami B(DE3) (Novagen), Shuffle 
T7 Express (NEB), C41(DE3) (Lucigen), or C43(DE3) 
(Lucigen), and were plated on Luria Bertani (LB) 
agar containing 100  µg   mL−1 ampicillin (pET21b) or 
50  µg   mL−1 kanamycin (pET24a). Strains with pGro7 
were also grown in the presence of 34 µg   mL−1 chloram-
phenicol. Cultures from colonies were grown at 37 ºC at 
250 RPM in LB medium with the same concentration of 
antibiotics prior to cryostorage in 15% (v/v) glycerol at 
-80 ºC.
Medium preparation and protein expression
2xLB medium contained: 10  g  L−1 yeast extract, 20  g 
 L−1 tryptone, and 5  g  L−1 NaCl. TB medium (Difico) 
was prepared according to manufacturer directions. 
Defined medium [30] contained:13.3  g  L−1  KH2PO4, 
4  g  L−1  (NH4)2HPO4•H2O, 1.7  g  L−1 citrate, 1.2  g  L−1 
 MgSO4•7H2O, 4.5  mg  L−1 thiamine HCl, and 1 × trace 
metals mix. The 100 × trace metals mix contained: 
10  mg  L−1  H3BO3, 10  mg  L−1  CoCl2•6H2O, 2.5  g  L−1 
 ZnSO4•7H2O, 400  mg  L−1  MnCl2•4H2O, 10  mg  L−1 
 Na2MoO4•2H2O, 180  mg  L−1  CuSO4•5H2O, 2  g  L−1 
 FeSO4•7H2O, 10  mg  L−1  NiSO4•6H2O. Semi-defined 
medium [30] contained: 13  g  L−1  KH2PO4, 10  g  L−1 
 K2HPO4, 4.6 g  L−1  NaH2PO4, 3 g  L−1  (NH4)2HPO4•H2O, 
2  g  L−1  MgSO4•7H2O, 73.8  mg  L−1  CaCl2•2H2O, and 
1 × trace metals mix. Complex medium [30] contained:

5  g  L−1 yeast extract, 10  g  L−1 tryptone, 10  g  L−1 NaCl, 
8.34  g  L−1  KH2PO4, 6.74  g  L−1, 0.5  g  L−1  MgSO4•7H2O, 
50  mg  L−1  CaCl2•2H2O, and 1 × trace metals mix. Non-
defined components with base salts as well as 580  g 
 L−1 glycerol were autoclaved prior to use. Stock 1  M 
 MgSO4•7H2O, 1  M  CaCl2•2H2O, 1  M isopropyl ß-D-
1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), 1 g   mL−1 thiamine HCl, 
200 g  L−1 glucose, 200 g  L−1 L-arabinose, and 100 × trace 
metals mix were sterile filtered (0.2  µm) prior to use. 
Defined, semi-defined, and complex medias were pre -
pared fresh prior to use.
Overnight cultures were started in identical medium as 
was used for expression using cells from freezer stocks. 
Final antibiotic concentration were 100  µg   mL−1 ampi -
cillin (pET21b), 50  µg   mL−1 kanamycin (pET24a), or 
34  µg   mL−1 chloramphenicol (pGro7). Overnight cul -
tures were grown at 37  ºC at 250 RPM for 16 to 20  h. 
Optical density at 600 nm  (OD600) (Genesys) was meas -
ured. Subcultures were normalized to an optical density 
of 0.05 A.U.. Small-scale expression experiments were 
carried out in 25 mL of medium in 125 mL baffled shake 
flasks (Kimble KIMAX). Cell growth occurred at 37 ºC at 
250 RPM in a shaker incubator (New Brunswick Innova 
42) until an  OD600 of 0.6 A.U. to 0.8 A.U. was reached. 
At that time, protein production was initiated by the 
addition of IPTG to 0.5  mM final concentration. For 
cells with pGro7, chaperone expression was induced for 
with 5 g  L−1 arabinose at the same time IPTG was added. 
After inducers were added, incubator temperature was 
dropped to 20 ºC and protein expression was carried out 
for 24  h unless otherwise noted. An  OD600 reading was 
taken prior to centrifuging 5 mL or 10 mL of culture at 
4000 rcf for 10  min. The supernatant was removed and 
cell pellet stored at -80 ºC prior to further analysis.
Cell lysis and active PETase quantification
Frozen cell pellets were defrosted at room temperature 
prior to resuspension in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer 
(pH 7.4). For lysis per unit volume, 50 µL volume of buffer 
was added per 1  mL of culture harvested. For lysis per 
unit optical density, cells were resuspended in buffer to 
achieve an  OD600 of 100 A.U.. Resuspended pellets were 
transferred to a 1.5  mL centrifuge tube, and lysozyme 
was added to 1 mg   mL−1 and Triton 100 × was added to 
1μL  mL−1. Lysis occurred on a multi-tube rocker-rotator 
(VWR) set to 15  rpm for 20  min at room temperature. 
After initial lysis, DNA disruption was achieved by addi -
tion of DNase (Invitrogen) to 5 U  mL−1 total lysis volume. 
Tubes were rotated for an additional 20 min at room tem-
perature. Crude lysate-containing tubes were centrifuged 
for 30  min at 4  °C and 22,000 rcf, and the supernatant 
was retained as clarified lysate.
PETase activity was measured in soluble clarified 
lysates by activity on 4-nitrophenyl acetate (4-NPA) 
(Sigma). Samples were set up in a clear 96-well plate with 
each well containing 100 μL total volume with: 80 μL of 
100  mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7), 10 μL of 
lysate, and 10 μL of 10 mM 4-NPA. Stock 10 mM 4-NPA 
was prepared in acetonitrile. Lysates were diluted over a 
wide range using 100  mM potassium phosphate buffer 
(pH 7), targeting a diluted activity of ~ 0.025 to 0.05 units 
per well. A unit (U) is defined as 1  μmol 4-NPA turno -
ver to 4-nitrophenol per minute. The extinction coeffi -
cient for 4-nitrophenol was determined by dilution into 
100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7) (Fig. S1) and 
was found to be 11,627.5   M−1  cm−1 (assumed pathlength 
of 2  mm). Controls without PETase (10 μL additional 
buffer) were similarly set up to subtract off background 
rate due to non-enzymatic hydrolysis of 4-NPA. Absorb -
ance at a wavelength of 405  nm was measured on a 
microplate reader (Biotek) every 15  s for 10  min at 
25  °C. Active PETase concentration, expressed as units 
of PETase per liter of total culture, was determined by 
analysis of the initial rate of absorbance change over 
time, subtraction of a blank rate, and multiplication by 
appropriate dilution factors. Absorbances below 0.8 A.U. 
(~ 300 µM product) were used for initial rate calculations. 
Samples with rates above 0.14 A.U.  min−1 (6 mU   min−1) 
were eliminated and further diluted to ensure sufficient 
data points to determine a catalytic rate and that the rate 
was linear with PETase concentration. Additionally, ini -
tial rate was divided by total protein concentration and 
appropriate dilution factors to calculate units of PETase 
per gram of total protein. Statistical analysis used a two-
tailed Student’s t-test assuming equal variance.
Total protein quantification
Total protein quantification was carried out using a 
Pierce BCA kit according to manufacturer specifications 
and absorbance quantified using a microplate reader 
(Biotek) at 562 nm. For each set of buffers used, a buffer 
blank was included and the resulting absorbance was 
subtracted from that of the sample. Total protein amount 
was determined through comparison to bovine serum 
albumin standards (0.025 mg   mL−1 to 2.0 mg   mL−1) with 
buffer blank subtracted. A linear fit equation through all 
standard absorbances with a set intercept of 0 A.U. was 
used to quantify total protein concentration.
Protein purification
For quantitative protein purification, PETase expression 
was scaled up to 500  mL culture in a 2-L baffled flask 
(Pyrex). All other protein production steps were identi -
cal to those used for small-scale experiments. Cell rup -
ture occurred as previously described where the amount 
Page 5 of 18

of lysis buffer was scaled by final culture optical density, 
resulting in an  OD600 of 100 A.U.. An additional sonica -
tion step was performed after the DNase treatment of 
30% duty cycle for 1.5 min on ice (3x). To clarify lysates, 
samples were centrifuged at 18,500 rcf for 30 min at 4 °C. 
Samples were filtered through a 0.2  µm filter prior to 
purification.
Proteins were purified with an AKTA Go FPLC using 
two chromatography steps: immobilized metal affin -
ity chromatography (IMAC) followed by desalting into 
storage buffer. For IMAC, the binding buffer (A) was 
20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) with 500 mM 
NaCl and 20  mM imidazole, and elution buffer (B) was 
20  mM sodium phosphate (pH 7.4), 500  mM NaCl, 
500  mM imidazole. Imidazole and NaCl were added to 
clarified lysates to final concentrations of 20  mM and 
500  mM, respectively, to eliminate non-specific inter -
actions. A 1  mL HisTrap HP (Cytiva) column was used 
with a flow rate of 1 mL   min−1, unless otherwise noted. 
After clarified lysate was applied to the column, the col -
umn was washed with 100% A buffer until absorbance 
readings were lower than 100  mA.U.. A single step elu -
tion, unless otherwise noted, was carried out using 50% 
B buffer (250  mM imidazole) and 0.5  mL fractions col -
lected. Activity on 4-NPA was used to identify high activ-
ity fractions. Proteins were desalted into 50 mM sodium 
phosphate (pH 7), 30  mM NaCl, 0.01% (w/v) sodium 
azide using a 5 mL HiTrap PD-10 column (Cytiva). Puri -
fied samples were stored at 4 °C until use.
Total protein concentration was measured using BCA 
and comparison to BSA standard curve, as described 
above. Protein purity was assessed by SDS-PAGE (all sup-
plies from BioRAD). Samples were denatured in 1 × Lae-
mmli buffer with β-mercaptoethanol at 95 °C for 10 min. 
Samples containing 2.5  µg of total protein were loaded 
on a Stain-free Any kDa gel and separation occurred 
for 35  min at 150  V using 1 × tris/glycine/SDS buffer. 
Precision plus unstained molecular weight standards 
were used to assess molecular weight and semi-quan -
tify amount. To visualize proteins, Stain-free activation 
occurred for 5 min followed by visualization using a Gel 
Doc XR + and gel analysis used Image Lab.
Specific activity and Michaelis–Menten constant 
determination
Specific activity, kcat, and KM were determined for PETase 
and variants using 4-NPA at 25  °C, similar to [31, 32]. 
Samples were set up in a clear 96-well plate with each 
well containing 100 μL total volume with: 80 μL of 
100  mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7), 10 μL of 
sample, and 10 μL of 4-NPA. Controls without PETase 
(10 μL additional buffer) were similarly set up to subtract 
off background rate due to non-enzymatic hydrolysis of 
4-NPA. After initial mixing, absorbance at a wavelength 
of 405 nm was measured on a microplate reader (Biotek) 
every 15  s for 10  min. All characterized proteins were 
produced in SHuffle T7 Express.
For specific activity, the final concentration of 4-NPA 
was 1 mM and various PETase concentrations were eval -
uated (0.5  μg   mL−1 to 20  μg   mL−1 final concentration), 
each in triplicate. Initial rate was determined until an 
absorbance of 0.8 A.U. was reached. Samples with activ -
ity similar to background buffer or which reached an 
absorbance of 0.8 A.U. before 5 min were eliminated. A 
unit (U) is defined as 1 μmol 4-NPA turnover to 4-nitro -
phenol per minute. Subtracted units were plotted against 
total protein concentration to determine the specific 
activity by fitting a linear line through all data and set -
ting the y-intercept to 0 (Kaleidagraph). To determine kcat 
and KM, samples contained approximately 1 μM PETase 
(actual concentrations listed for each variant). 4-NPA 
concentrations were tested between 1 and 20 mM, each 
in triplicate. Background hydrolysis was measured at 
each 4-NPA concentration to be subtracted from the ini -
tial rate with enzyme. Subtracted initial rates were plot -
ted as a function of 4-NPA concentration and fit to the 
Michaelis–Menten equation (Kaleidagraph).
Microparticle assay
PETase catalysis of insoluble PET microparticles (Good -
fellow, ES30-PD-000131, < 300 µm, 40% crystallinity) was 
performed as proof of activity on real substrates using 
a method adapted from [9]. Samples were prepared in 
15-mL polypropylene tubes (Falcon), with each contain -
ing 5 mL of sodium phosphate buffer (pH 9), 150 mg PET 
particles (final concentration 30  mg   mL−1), and PETase 
at a desired ratio to PET particles (0.34  mgPETase  gPET

contained no PETase. HiC (Strem) concentration was 
determined by BCA to be 28 mg   mL−1 and was assumed 
pure after analysis by SDS-PAGE. Reactions were carried 
out in an Eppendorf ThermoMixer C at 1000  rpm and 
37 °C. At each timepoint, 500 μL of sample was removed 
and centrifuged at 13,000 rcf for 5 min to pellet insoluble 
remaining PET. The supernatant was removed and reac -
tion was quenched using 2 N HCl at a ratio of 10 μL HCl 
to 200 μL of sample supernatant. Samples with high con -
centration of products were cloudy, requiring acetonitrile 
addition to become clear (up to two-times the final vol -
ume). Samples were stored at -20 °C prior to analysis by 
HPLC.
High performance liquid chromatography
Standards of terephthalic acid (TPA) (Sigma), 2-hydroxy-
ethyl terephthalic acid (MHET), and bis(2-hydroxyethyl) 
terephthalic acid (BHET) (Sigma) were prepared in order 
Page 6 of 18Carter et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2024) 23:319 
to quantify reaction products from microparticle cataly -
sis. TPA was dissolved in 20  mM sodium phosphate 
buffer (pH 7.4) to a concentration of 2  mM. The pH of 
the solution was adjusted to 7 by dropwise addition of 
1.25 N NaOH until the solution became clear and volu -
metric flask used to achieve the final desired volume. 
BHET was dissolved to a concentration of 2 mM in 24% 
(v/v) acetonitrile and 76% (v/v) 100 mM potassium phos -
phate (pH 7) buffer as BHET has poor solubility in water 
[33]. Further dilution of the 2  mM BHET solution used 
the 24% acetonitrile-buffer solvent to maintain BHET 
solubility.
MHET was not commercially available, requiring pro -
duction by enzymatic hydrolysis of BHET using Humi -
cola insolens cutinase (HiC, product Novozym ® 51,032). 
BHET was dissolved in 24% (v/v) acetonitrile and 76% 
(v/v) 100 mM potassium phosphate (pH 7) buffer before 
addition of 0.1  gHiC  gBHET
−1. The reaction volume was 
30  mL. Reactions were carried out at 40°C and mixed 
at 600  rpm using a Chemglass heated magnetic mixer. 
A negative control reaction without HiC addition was 
included in the experimental setup. Samples of reaction 
contents were drawn at 0, 3, 24, 48, and 72 h to determine 
the extent of reaction from BHET to MHET as measured 
by HPLC peak area. The reaction was quenched by addi -
tion of 50 µL 2 N HCl per 1 mL sample. After 77 h, an 
additional 0.1   gHiC  gBHET
−1 was added to complete the 
reaction, which took 144 total hours. The purest MHET 
sample was determined to be 1.89 mM by HPLC analysis 
comparing peak areas of BHET to MHET, representing 
94% percent conversion. Further dilution of the 1.89 mM 
MHET solution to desired concentrations used the 24% 
acetonitrile-buffer solvent.
Soluble aromatic products TPA, MHET, and BHET 
produced from reaction of PETase on PET microparti -
cles were separated using high performance liquid chro -
matography (HPLC). Reverse phase chromatography 
was performed using Agilent Polaris 3 C18-A column 
(150 × 3.0  mm, 3  µm) and Thermo HPLC system. Sol -
vents were: (A) water with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid and (B) 
acetonitrile with 0.1% (v/v) formic acid. Equilibration 
occurred with 5% B at 0.5 mL  min−1 and the column oven 
was set to 60°C. Sample injections were 5 µL. Gradient 
profile was adapted from [34], consisting of: 5% B for 
2 min, 5% B to 17% B from 2 to 4 min, 17% B to 25% B 
from 4 to 6 min, 25% B to 40% B from 6 to 10 min, hold 
at 40% B from 10 to 12  min and 5% B re-equilibration 
from 12 to 16 min. Retention times, peak separation, and 
peak area to concentration correlations for TPA, MHET, 
and BHET were determined for range of concentrations 
from 0.05 to 1 mM (Fig. S2). Linear regression with a set 
y-intercept of 0 was used to determine an equation for 
converting peak area to analyte concentration.
Size exclusion chromatography
Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) was used to assess 
the oligomerization state of PETase. An AKTA Go out -
fitted with a Superdex 75 Increase 10/300 GL column 
(Cytiva) was used for the separation. The method was 
isocratic using 50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 7), 30 mM 
NaCl, 0.01% (w/v) sodium azide flowing at 1 mL   min−1. 
UV absorbance was measured to determine protein 
retention times. A 100 µL sample of purified PETase was 
separated and 0.5 mL fractions were collected for further 
analysis of esterase activity on 4-NPA. Only IsPETase was 
analyzed and it was purified from SHuffle T7 Express cul-
tures. Blue dextran (Promega) was used to determine the 
void volume and protein standards (Sigma) were used to 
create a standard curve to determine molecular weight.
Circular dichroism
Far UV circular dichroism (CD) scans of purified PETase 
proteins were used to determine secondary structure. 
PETase samples were made to 0.03  mg   mL−1 in 10  mM 
sodium phosphate buffer (pH 8) and placed in a clean 
1  cm quartz cuvette (Fisher Scientific). Scans between 
195 and 260  nm were made using an Aviv Biomedi -
cal Model 435 circular dichroism spectrophotometer. 
Wavelength step size was 1  nm and three scans were 
completed per sample. Scans were averaged and a buffer 
blank subtracted prior to calculating mean residue ellip -
ticity [35].
Bioreactor
Bioreactor trials were carried out in an Eppendorf 2-L 
benchtop bioreactor connected to BioFlo 120 control 
unit. A 25  mL starter culture in a 125  mL baffled flask 
(Kimble KIMEX) was inoculated from a freezer stock and 
grown at 37 °C and 250 rpm for 16 to 20 h. Starter cul -
tures were made in identical media to that used the bio -
reactor. A volume of the overnight culture was added to 
the 1.5 L of medium in the reactor to achieve an  OD600 
of 0.05 A.U.. Cells were grown at 37  °C until an  OD600 
between 0.6 A.U. and 0.8 A.U. was reached, at which time 
protein production was induced with 0.5 mM IPTG and 
the reactor temperature was dropped to 20 °C. Agitation 
speed was initially set to 300 rpm and air flow rate to 1.5 
L  min−1. Cascade control was used to keep the dissolved 
oxygen amount greater than 30% of saturation by varying 
impeller speed (max 800 rpm) and air flow rate (max 15 L 
 min−1). A pH window was set between 6.8 and 7.2 using 
addition of either ammonium hydroxide or hydrochloric 
acid. In addition to the bioreactor, a 100 mL shake flask 
culture in a 500  mL baffled flask (Kimble KIMEX) was 
grown using similar setpoints (temperature and induc -
tion) as the bioreactor to compare scales and impact of 
control of process variables. The culture in the shake flask 
Page 7 of 18
Carter et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2024) 23:319 
 
did not have pH or dissolved oxygen control, and was 
mixed at 250 rpm in a shaker incubator (New Brunswick 
Innova 42).
At each timepoint following induction, 1.5  mL sam -
ples were removed for analysis. After measuring  OD600, 
samples were centrifuged at 20,000 rcf for 5 min at room 
temperature. The supernatant was removed to deter -
mine glycerol substrate consumption and acetate product 
buildup. Glycerol and acetate were separated using HPLC 
and an Aminex HPX-87H column (BioRad) at 30 °C with 
isocratic 0.5  mM  H2SO4 flowing at 0.6  mL   min−1 [36]. 
Compounds were quantified using refractive index and 
comparisons to standards of pure glycerol and acetate 
at known concentrations. Culture pellets were stored at 
-80 °C for activity analysis in lysate as described above.
A second bioreactor run was carried out for complex 
medium with 35  g  L−1 glycerol to determine reproduc -
ibility as well as harvest culture for purification. Time to 
harvest was determined by taking samples once per hour 
to track the accumulation of acetate and PETase activity 
to determine when the peak activity occurred. Once a 
measurement was made that had decreased activity, the 
final volume of the reactor was measured (1.3 L) and split 
into two centrifuge bottles to harvest. The cell pellet from 
one of the bottles was lysed and Is PETase purified using 
identical procedures as above except a 5 mL HisTrap HP 
column and 53 mL HiPrep 26/10 Desalting column were 
used due to the larger scale. Final protein concentration 
was determined using BCA and purity assessed by SDS-
PAGE, both described above.
Results:
Screening IsPETase production hosts
Production using a codon-optimized Is PETase without 
a signal sequence and with a C-terminal hexa-histidine 
tag (Supporting Information) was initially carried out 
in BL21(DE3) as it is a common laboratory protein pro -
duction strain. The medium used was 2xLB and protein 
expression was induced with 0.5  mM IPTG for 24  h 
at 20  °C as similar protocols have proven successful for 
IsPETase in the past [8]. We found approximately 14 units 
(U, μmolproduct  min−1) of Is PETase produced per liter of 
culture volume as measured on the soluble substrate 
4-nitrophenol acetate (4-NPA) (Table S1). A control was 
performed where an empty pET21b plasmid was used in 
place of pET21b Is PETase, finding 2.6 units per liter cul -
ture, suggesting that IsPETase is in fact being made. We 
screened several parameters including induction tem -
perature (37 °C), inducer concentration (0.05 mM IPTG), 
and expression time (48  h), none of which led to large 
improvements in soluble and active enzyme production, 
and in the case of raising the induction temperature, sig -
nificantly less enzyme activity (Table S1).
We hypothesized the limitation we observed in pro -
duction of Is PETase in BL21(DE3) was due to the lack 
of disulfide bond formation in the reducing cytoplasm, 
and thus potentially Is PETase instability. We evaluated 
two common cytoplasmic disulfide bond forming E. coli 
hosts, RosettaGami B(DE3) and SHuffle T7 Express, for 
their ability to produce IsPETase. Using the same expres-
sion conditions as before, Is PETase production was 
enhanced when produced in RosettaGami B and SHuffle 
T7 Express, reaching 159 ± 34 and 367 ± 58 units per liter 
culture, respectively (Fig.  1a). To ensure that the SHuf -
fle T7 Express was not causing the activity difference, an 
empty pET21b plasmid was added to SHuffle T7 Express. 
The background activity of lysates without Is PETase on 
4-NPA was 2.8 ± 0.6 units per liter culture. These results 
suggest a vast improvement of cytoplasmic IsPETase pro-
duction when a disulfide bond forming host was used and 
further enhancement by including a cytoplasmic copy of 
dsbC. We also measured the total protein present in each 
lysate sample in order to normalize activity to total pro -
tein to control for growth and lysis differences finding 
similar improvement (Fig.  1b). We attempted to further 
increase IsPETase production by utilizing a different plas-
mid, pET24a, as well as co-expressing with chaperones 
GroEL/ES, finding neither resulted in more Is PETase 
production (Supplementary Note 1, Table S2).
Cell growth was monitored by optical density to ensure 
differences in production due to the alternate strains 
were not due to growth. The SHuffle T7 Express cells 
grew to a lower optical density of 4.0 ± 0.3 A.U. compared 
to 6.8 ± 0.2 A.U. for BL21(DE3). Rosetta-Gami B(DE3) 
grew to an even lower optical density of 1.7 ± 0.1 A.U.. 
The BL21(DE3) cultures consistently grew to almost dou-
ble the optical density of the SHuffle T7 Express cultures 
as measured at 24  h post induction. To ensure that the 
cell rupture step was not limiting, BL21(DE3) and SHuf -
fle T7 Express samples were also lysed with the volume 
of lysis buffer scaled by optical density. When analyz -
ing active protein using this method, the SHuffle T7 
Express samples were found to have 493 ± 55 units per 
liter culture and BL21(DE3) had 37 ± 4 units per liter 
culture (Table  S2). When normalizing by total protein, 
BL21(DE3) had 47 ± 10. units per gram, and SHuffle T7 
Express had 603 ± 3 units per gram. Using results from 
the optical density normalized lysis, SHuffle T7 Express 
produced approximately 13-fold more active Is PETase 
than BL21(DE3).
We next sought to compare the SHuffle T7 Express 
host to other E. coli strains that are commonly used 
to produce Is PETase, mainly C41(DE3) [13]. C41 
and C43 OverExpress strains have genetic mutations 
that enhance the production of toxic proteins. Using 
the plasmid assembled for this study, we found the 
Page 8 of 18Carter et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2024) 23:319 
C41(DE3) and C43(DE3) strains to produce 2.9 and 
1.3 units per liter culture, much lower than that of 
BL21(DE3) and similar to that of cells without petase  
(Fig.  1a). Surprised by this result, we screened 8 
C41(DE3) colonies to ensure all had low activity, which 
was verified with the highest activity being 3.1 units per 
liter culture (Table  S3). Compared to the commonly 
used plasmid for Is PETase production from the plasmid 
repository Addgene, the petase Is gene used in this study 
has different codon optimization and does not contain 
a signal sequence. The Addgene plasmid was purchased 
and tested in C41(DE3) and SHuffle T7 Express, finding 
the C41(DE3) cells produced 107 units per liter culture 
and SHuffle T7 Express only made 10.0 units per liter 
culture, both significantly different than when the sig -
nal sequence was removed (Table S4). This is unsurpris -
ing given the ability of signal sequences to be utilized 
across species and the benefit to using SHuffle is tied to 
cytoplasmic expression. We did not measure activity in 
the supernatant to see if the enzyme was secreted out -
side the cells. Although commonly used C41(DE3) did 
have much more intracellular expression when a ver -
sion of petase Is with a signal sequence was produced, it 
was still 3.4-fold lower than when SHuffle T7 Express 
was used with a construct that does not contain a signal 
sequence.
Purification and characterization of IsPETase
IsPETase was purified to determine the amount of pro -
tein produced (Table  1). Purification from BL21(DE3) 
resulted in 1.6  mg of protein at a purity of approxi -
mately 50 to 65% as measured by densitometry (Fig.

S3). The lack of purity from BL21(DE3) is not surprising 
given its low production and is likely due to non-spe -
cific binding during the IMAC step. Production from 
SHuffle T7 Express was 10.5 mg from a 500 mL culture 
at an estimated 99% purity. Taken together, the purifi -
cation results suggest a 13-fold improvement upon use 
of the disulfide bond promoting host, identical to the 
values found when comparing activities in lysate. Few 
reports list the purified titer of the original Is PETase, 
with one finding 15 mg of purified protein per L culture 
when produced from C41(DE3) [14]. Here, we were 
able to produce 21  mg per L, which represents a 25% 
improvement. Circular dichroism confirmed that the 
soluble protein was well-folded (Fig. S4). Size exclusion 
chromatography showed that Is PETase is monomeric, 
as has been found previously (Fig. S5) [23]. Further, 
activity on 4-NPA was measured for SEC fractions 
(Fig. S5), confirming the single peak has all the esterase 
activity.
To ensure the Is PETase produced from SHuffle had 
similar activity to the enzyme produced in other hosts, 
catalysis was measured on soluble 4-NPA and insoluble 
PET microparticle substrates. Initial characterization was 
performed using 1 mM of 4-NPA at a variety of PETase 
concentrations to determine the specific activity for the 
enzyme as well as ensure that activity measurements are 
linearly dependent on protein concentration. Using these 
conditions, we found that PETase had a specific activity 
of 5.26 ± 0.14 U/mg or 0.151 ± 0.035 U/nmol (Fig. S6), 
with a linear dependence. Michaelis–Menten parameters 
were determined for 4-NPA (Fig. S7), providing values 
of 8.16 ± 0.66 mM for Km and 30.3 ± 1.1  s−1 for kcat. These 
values compare similarly to the literature values of K m of 
4.6 mM and kcat of 27  s−1 for wild-type PETase on 4-NPA, 
albeit their characterization was done at 30 °C and ours 
at 25 °C, both in pH 7 buffer [31].
IsPETase activity was determined using PET micropar -
ticles to represent realistic substrates. Samples were pre -
pared with three ratios of IsPETase to PET particles: 0.34, 
0.69, and 1.0  mgPETase/gPET and soluble TPA, MHET and 
BHET were measured over time (Fig. 2). After 96 h, reac-
tions containing 0.34  mg   g−1, 0.69  mg   g−1, or 1  mg   g−1 
IsPETase released approximately 1.3, 2.1, and 2.5  mM 
product, over a thousand times higher than the sam -
ple without Is PETase. For 1 mg   g−1 at 48 h, 1.76 mM of 
soluble aromatic products were formed, which compares 
quite similarly to 1.72 mM released when measured in a 
previous study using similar reaction conditions (40  °C, 
29 mg   mL−1 PET loading, 1 mg IsPETase per gram PET) 
[9]. These results suggest that the Is PETase produced in 
this study without a signal sequence and in a disulfide-
bond promoting host has similar activity as those pro -
duced using other methods.
Medium optimization for IsPETase production
Given the success of SHuffle T7 Express to increase the 
production of Is PETase, we next performed a medium 
optimization. While using a non-defined, complex 
medium such as 2xLB is possible, moving to a more 
defined medium with additional carbon and nitrogen 
sources could benefit both economics and expression 
[37]. As such, six different medias were assessed at 25 mL 
scale for active Is PETase production with varying carbon 
sources and inducer molecules (Table  S5). For defined 
[38] and semi-defined [39] medias, recipes were selected 
that have previously shown success in increasing biomass 
and recombinant protein production in E. coli [30]. Three 
non-defined medias were tested, 2xLB, TB, and complex 
medium [30, 40].
Comparing the Is PETase activity in 2xLB and Terrific 
Broth (TB), more than double the activity was observed 
with 2xLB despite cells growing to double the optical 
density in TB (Table  2). When defined, semi-defined 
or complex media was tested with glucose as a carbon 
source, cells all reached higher optical densities than 
2xLB, but the best producing complex medium sam -
ple only had half of the activity of 2xLB (Table  2). Due 
to the placement of the T7 RNAP gene in the lac operon 
in SHuffle [24], production of T7 RNAP is catabolite 
repressed resulting only in expression of desired protein 
when glucose levels are depleted, providing a reason why 
IsPETase levels were low even after complete consump -
tion of glucose. Additionally, the genetic construction of 
SHuffle does not permit lactose to be used as an inducer 
due to the knockout of lacZ [24]. Given the partial suc -
cess of the complex medium, 35 g  L−1 glycerol was substi-
tuted for glucose as a carbon source. Using this medium 
in 25-mL batch cultures, production reached 980 U per 
L culture with an optical density of almost 10 A.U., both 
improvements over 2xLB.
Production of IsPETase in a bioreactor
Production of Is PETase was moved to a 2-L bench -
top bioreactor with a 1.5 L working volume in order to 
have a larger culture volume as well as take advantage of 
increased aeration, better mixing, and pH control com -
pared to the shake flasks. In addition to the bioreactor, a 
100 mL culture in a 500 mL baffled shake flask was run 
simultaneously to determine the impact of improved aer-
ation and pH control in the bioreactor. Complex media 
with glycerol was selected as it had the highest produc -
tion in shake flasks (Table 2).
Culturing in the controlled bioreactor yielded fur -
ther improvements in PETase production (Fig.  3). 
The optical density of cultures grown in this medium 
reached 19 A.U. at 48 h of total culture time. The cul -
ture in the 500 mL shake flask grew similarly to that in 
Page 10 of 18Carter et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2024) 23:319 
the bioreactor, reaching a maximum cell density of 16.7 
A.U. (Fig. S8a). Peak activity in the bioreactor occurred 
at 45  h post induction, reaching a value of 1992 units 
per L. Similarly, the scaled-up shake flask reached 1749 
units per L culture at 45  h post induction (Fig. S8a). 
Enzyme activity dropped significantly over the next 
24 h of culturing, with approximately 66% lost for the 
bioreactor culture (Fig.  3). An even more precipitous 
loss was found for the culture in the shake flask cul -
ture, where the difference of 2 h between sample times 
resulted in 94% loss (Fig. S8a).
To determine a reason for the decline in activity, glyc -
erol consumption as well as fermentation product accu -
mulation was tracked using HPLC. Glycerol showed 
steady consumption throughout the fermentation trial 
with increased rate as the cells reached higher cell den -
sities. This matches the agitation and aeration rates as 
they were elevated to compensate for more cells in the 
bioreactor. Glycerol consumption continued through -
out the bioreactor run and was not fully exhausted, with 
over 11 g  L−1 glycerol remaining after 75-h of culturing, 
suggesting limitation of carbon source is not an issue.

remainder of the culturing time. The same was found 
for the shake flask sample. This suggests a metabolic 
imbalance at these late culture times leading to overflow 
metabolism of glycerol to acetate [41]. The production of 
acetate at 48 h seems strongly correlated with the loss of 
recombinant PETase activity. Since the shake flask cul -
ture did not have pH control, the accumulation of ace -
tate and likely drop in pH might explain the large loss of 
active enzyme.
Excited by the increase in PETase production upon 
moving to the bioreactor, we sought to reproduce the 
data as well as purify the protein to quantify the amount 
produced. A repeated bioreactor run largely followed 
the first one, with an optical density of 13.5 and a peak 
activity of 2109 units per L at 43  h post induction (Fig. 
S8b). A time point one hour later indicated a decline in 
active protein amount to 1859 units per L as well as ace -
tate accumulation to 80  mg  L−1. At this time the entire 
bioreactor was harvested for purification. Using the same 
purification procedure as previous, we found a total of

Fig. 3 Scale-up production of IsPETase. IsPETase was produced in a 2-L bioreactor at a 1.5 L working volume scale from SHuffle T7 Express cells. 
Bioreactor runs used complex media with glycerol. Initial growth occurred at 37 °C followed by protein production at 20 °C after induction 
with 0.5 mM IPTG. Induction occurred at 3 h. Activity unit (U) were determined on 1 mM 4-NPA at room temperature in 100 mM potassium 
phosphate buffer (pH 7) and is normalized to culture volume (black squares). Also measured was optical density at 600 nm (red circles), agitation 
(purple), and dissolved oxygen (orange). Cascade control of dissolved oxygen was utilized for both reactor runs. pH was controlled between 6.8 
and 7.2. Glycerol substrate (blue diamonds) and acetate product (green triangle) concentrations were measured by HPLC

104 ± 6 mg of PETase protein produced per L bioreactor 
volume, which is an almost five-fold increase from our 
earlier purifications using cultures grown on 2xLB, with 
similar protein purity (Fig. S8c). This gave us a volumetric 
productivity of 2.21 ± 0.13 mg  L−1  h−1 for our process.
Production and purification of PETase variants
Given the success of using SHuffle T7 Express as a pro -
tein production host, we sought to confirm if a similar 
benefit would be found for some of the recently evolved 
PETase variants. Using identical codons to the origi -
nal petaseIs, genes encoding for FAST-PETase and Hot-
PETase were ordered and added to pET21b plasmid with 
a C-terminal hexa-histidine tag. In addition to SHuffle 
T7 Express, BL21(DE3) was also explored for production 
to see if the benefit of including disulfide bond forming 
machinery was beneficial for the evolved variants. Pro -
duction experiments were carried out in 2xLB and shake 
flasks as was done for the WT IsPETase and enzyme 
activity was determined in soluble cell lysates.
Surprisingly, PETase variants did not demonstrate the 
same advantage of SHuffle T7 Express, with Hot-PETase 
showing improved production in BL21(DE3) (Fig.  4a). 
As before, SHuffle T7 Express produced a statistically 
significant amount more Is PETase than BL21(DE3) 
(p = 1.38 ×  10–4). The highest observed activities were 
for FAST-PETase in both BL21(DE3) and SHuffle T7 
Express, with activities reaching 896 and 866 units per 
liter of culture, respectively. The lack of statistical sig -
nificance between these values (p = 0.49) indicates that 
the disulfide bond forming machinery in SHuffle T7 
Express cells has no observable impact on the expression 
of FAST PETase. Further, Hot-PETase was expressed sig-
nificantly less effectively (p = 0.004) in SHuffle T7 Express 
cells than in BL21(DE3) cells, with 717 and 382 units per 
liter of culture, respectively. This is surprising because 
Hot-PETase has seven cysteine residues rather than four 
for IsPETase. Similar trends in production amount were 
found when normalizing activity in lysate to total protein 
amount (Fig. 4b).
Enzyme purification followed by characterization 
was carried out to determine the amount of PETase 
variants produced as well as ensure high enzyme activ -
ity. Production experiments were carried out in both 
BL21(DE3) and SHuffle T7 express to validate the activ -
ity differences seen in lysates (Table  3). FAST-PETase 
and Hot-PETase were better produced and purified in 
BL21(DE3) than SHuffle T7 Express, reaching titers of 
66  mg per L and 78  mg per L, respectively. Analysis 
of protein purity, revealed that all proteins were puri -
fied to greater than 90% purity (Fig. S9). A reported 
titer of 12  mg per L was found for Hot-PETase when 
produced in SHuffle T7 Express [14], similar to the 
19  mg per L here. Using BL21(DE3), we found a 6.5-
fold improvement over what was previously observed. 
Another study found the amount of Hot-PETase to be

roughly 110 mg per L when made in Origami 2 cells [7 ], 
a bit higher than what we achieved. Far UV CD analy -
sis revealed that purified FAST-PETase and Hot-PETase 
were similarly well folded regardless of whether they 
were produced in BL21(DE3) or SHuffle T7 Express 
(Fig. S10).
Characterization of PETase variants
Specific activity was determined on 4-NPA as was 
done for the Is PETase, revealing that FAST-PETase had 
slightly higher activity at 25 °C compared to the other 
variants (Table  S6, Fig. S11a). This would explain the 
elevated activity of the FAST-PETase compared to the 
other variants in lysate activity analysis, while simi -
lar purified protein amounts were found. Likewise, 
FAST-PETase had an increased k cat compared to the 
other variants on 4-NPA at 25 °C (Table S6, Fig. S11b). 
However, when looking at catalytic efficiency, k cat/KM, 
on 4-NPA, all the variants were statistically similar to 
the IsPETase, suggesting the improvement of the vari -
ants is only relevant at higher temperatures and on PET 
substrates.
Finally, activity on PET microparticles was assessed 
by measuring soluble aromatic product generation over 
time at 37 °C for all the variants in this study (Fig.  5). 
Additionally, the commercially-available cutinase from 
Humicola isolens, HiC, was included in the study. Anal -
ysis of total released soluble analytes after 24 h revealed 
that FAST-PETase liberated over 6  mM products, the 
most amongst any enzyme type tested in this study. 
Comparatively, Hot-PETase, WT PETase, HiC, and the 
no enzyme control liberated 5 mM, 1.8 mM, 0.28 mM, 
and 2  μM products, respectively at 24  h. Other works 
have found HiC to have low activity on PET relative to 
other enzymes [33]. Reacting on real PET substrates 
revealed the benefit of the evolved variants even at 
a modest reaction temperature of 37  °C. Converting 
all soluble products to BHET equivalents, the FAST-
PETase percent conversion to soluble products was 
6.84 ± 0.16%, similar to the approximately 8% from 
another comparative PETase study [8 ], albeit at differ -
ent reaction conditions. From the same study, we would 
expect better performance for Hot-PETase at elevated 
temperatures.
Discussion
We have found that Is PETase is optimally produced in a 
disulfide bond promoting host which is capable of rear -
rangement of improperly formed disulfide bonds due 
to inclusion of a cytoplasmic copy of dsbC. In contrast, 
evolved PETase variants FAST-PETase and Hot-PETase 
were better produced in BL21(DE3) with a reducing 
cytoplasm, even though FAST-PETase has the same 
two disulfides and Hot-PETase a third as well as a free 
cysteine. Despite the promise of SHuffle for making pro -
teins that require complex disulfide bonding patterns for 
activity, we have found some limitations working with 
this host, specifically around genetic construction and 
purification yield. Medium screening and moving cul -
tures to a controlled and well-mixed bioreactor further 
elevated the production of Is PETase to overcome these 
limitations. Accumulation of acetate in our bioreactor 
trials seems to be correlated with recombinant enzyme 
activity loss, suggesting careful monitoring of cultures to 
ensure titer is maximized.
Comparing our bioreactor results to produce Is PETase 
with those for K. pastoris, although we purified a lower 
protein amount per reactor volume, our strategy resulted 
in better per mass productivities. For our bioreactor 
trial with complex medium with glycerol, a CDW of 
5.02 g per liter was achieved (2.69 g of CDW per L cul -
ture per  OD600), with IsPETase representing 2.1% of total 
cell mass. Comparing to K. pastoris cultures, CDW was 
approximately 270 g per L with 1.2 g PETase per L pro -
duced [20], or just 0.4% of the total cell mass. Further, 
converting to a per cell mass productivity, PETase pro -
duced in SHuffle was 0.45  mgPETase  gCDW
−1  h−1, while it 
was 0.037  mgPETase  gCDW
−1  h−1 when made in K. pastoris.

glycerol) and K. pastoris (methanol), yield and per mass 
productivities are important for economic considera -
tions as they incorporate the cost to produce biomass as 
well as reactor size. If a similar per mass yield was kept 
for SHuffle, the optical density would have to approach 
130 to produce 1 g per liter, which may be possible after 
further fermentation process optimization (i.e. medium 
selection, induction strategy, substrate and nutrient 
feeding, dissolved oxygen level, and mixing) [27]. An 
advantage of K. pastoris is its ability to secrete enzyme 
which should streamline downstream processing. Lastly, 
glycosylation using K. pastoris may be both advantageous 
and detrimental to PETase performance. While stability 
is increased due to glycosylation, depending on the loca -
tion of glycosylation, the active PET-binding site could 
be blocked, lowering the specific activity. Both increased 
stability and loss of activity were found for Is PETase 
made in K. pastoris due to glycosylation [20].
An unexpected finding of this work is that the evolved 
variants FAST-PETase and Hot-PETase were better pro -
duced and purified from BL21(DE3) than SHuffle T7 
Express. It is known that both variants have a higher

 Tm than Is PETase, due to more interactions in their 
folded structure, especially the extra disulfide bond in 
Hot-PETase. It is possible that these stabilized enzymes 
do not require disulfides to achieve the correct fold -
ing state, keeping them from forming inclusion bodies 
and permitting disulfide bond formation after cell lysis. 
This is most likely for FAST-PETase as its disulfides are 
formed between consecutive cysteines, with the same 
being true for Is PETase. For FAST- and Hot-PETase it is 
unknown if the extra disulfide bond in PETase (C203 and 
C239) compared to other cutinases is necessary for activ -
ity as is true for Is PETase [23]. Hot-PETase has an extra 
disulfide bond, rationally added between C233 and C282, 
as well as one free cysteine, C242. Of any of the variants, 
this enzyme would be expected to benefit most from a 
disulfide bond promoting host as well as disulfide bond 
isomerase to properly form as the two disulfides since 
they are relatively close to one another in the primary 
sequence and they are not formed between consecutive 
cysteines.
Hot-PETase production as measured after purifica -
tion was much lower from SHuffle T7 Express (19  mg 
per liter culture) compared to BL21(DE3) (77  mg per 
liter). Another study found that Hot-PETase production 
reached 110 mg per liter using Origami 2 [7], which has 
an oxidizing cytoplasm but lacks the DsbC chaperone. 
While they used different media and expression condi -
tions, this potentially shows the benefit of disulfide bond 
formation and negative impact of DsbC. A similar finding 
was found for luciferase, which has 10 cysteines, where 
less active enzyme was produced in cells with an oxidiz -
ing cytoplasm and cytoplasmic DsbC compared to cells 
with just an oxidizing cytoplasm [24]. The authors sug -
gest oxidized DsbC could impact the folding of a reduced 
protein. Alternatively, since the extra disulfide bond in 
Hot-PETase was not evolutionarily derived, it is possible 
that that the disulfide bond isomerase does not correctly 
recognize the designed fold to chaperone the protein to 
the correct confirmation, leading to misfolding and the 
drop off in production observed for SHuffle T7 Express.
In our work we found that purification of IsPETase dur-
ing the IMAC step resulted in a low yield. Active protein 
was not found in the flow through due to exceeding the 
binding capacity of the column. For the bioreactor trial 
and scaled-up purification, we found a similar yield for 
IsPETase to the small-scale expression trials (~ 30%). 
Likewise, FAST-PETase and Hot-PETase had low yields 
for purification of 40% and 29%, respectively, when pro -
duced in SHuffle T7 Express (Table  3). The yield was 
much higher for proteins produced in BL21(DE3), 89% 
for FAST-PETase and 72% for Hot-PETase, which is more 
in line with expectations for the purifications performed. 
This suggests something in the SHuffle lysate is causing 
a negative impact on the purification process. Possibly, 
as the PETase is interacting with the IMAC resin, it is 
changing structure causing interaction with the over -
expressed DsbC. Alternatively, the DsbC could become 
oxidized and cause unintended reduction of the oxidized 
PETase product [24]. A similar yield of between 18 and 
51% was observed for production and IMAC purification 
of a chaperone from SHuffle [27], possibly a wide spread 
problem using SHuffle as a host.
Since glycerol is inexpensive and less likely to suffer 
from overflow metabolism into acetate compared with 
glucose [42, 43], its utilization as a carbon source has 
more advantages than simply bypassing catabolite repres-
sion [44]. At low cell densities, acetate formation does not 
seem to occur in ours or other studies [41] when glycerol 
is used as a carbon source. However, we do see acetate 
accumulation starting approximately 45  h after bioreac -
tor inoculation, ultimately reaching 1 g  L−1 (Fig.  3). Ace-
tate accumulation is known to be toxic to cells, even at 
concentrations of 0.5 g  L−1 [42], resulting in decrease bio-
mass and recombinant protein production [43] as well as 
prompting reassimilation [45]. Acetate is hypothesized 
to have a negative impact on growth due to energetics 
to maintain intracellular pH or inhibition of methionine 
synthesis which impacts protein translation [46]. Acetate 
has also been proposed to have a negative effect on the 
stability of intracellular proteins [43] and alter transcrip -
tion [47]; however, it is unknown how general the tran -
scription changes are. We see a dramatic loss of Is PETase 
activity, even at low acetate concentrations of 0.05 g  L−1, 
with over 90% loss of activity in just 3 h for a shake flask 
culture with uncontrolled pH. It is unknown whether 
acetate buildup is the cause of the loss of active PETase 
or if acetate accumulation happens simultaneously with 
the loss of recombinant protein activity. Co-factor imbal-
ance or metabolite flux limitation likely cause the shift in 
glycerol metabolism to acetate at these later cell culture 
times. It is somewhat surprising to see such a precipitous 
loss of enzyme activity unless it is being scavenged for 
resource utilization, the enzyme has a short half-life and 
expression becomes limiting, or it is unfolding and mov -
ing to inclusion bodies. Regardless, our results suggest 
close monitoring of protein activity is necessary to catch 
a tight window of high production.
Our work focused on the expression and purifica -
tion of soluble and active PETase. It is well established 
that overexpressed proteins often end up in the inclu -
sion bodies of E. coli [48]. It is possible that strategies 
we evaluated such as higher temperature expression, 
increased inducer concentration, and even host selection 
led to increased cytoplasmic production of the enzyme 
into insoluble inclusion bodies. However, while purifica -
tion of denatured proteins is possible, refolding to active 
Page 16 of 18Carter et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2024) 23:319 
conformations can be a challenge, especially for proteins 
with complex disulfide patterns [48]. This has led us to 
focus efforts only on soluble production in this work.
This study focused on the development of expression 
conditions and scale-up for Is PETase as well as produc -
tion of recently evolved variants. Since the discovery 
of IsPETase in 2016, considerable work has gone into 
protein engineering this enzyme for higher stability 
and activity at elevated temperatures [3]. Based on the 
Arrhenius relationship, reaction rate should exponen -
tially increase as the temperature is elevated. Addition -
ally, it has been argued that as reaction temperatures 
approach the glass transition temperature, 60 ºC to 70 ºC 
for PET, catalysis is enhanced [7]. It has been established 
that PETase has higher activity on amorphous PET than 
crystalline PET [6]. However, PET re-crystallization also 
occurs near the glass transition temperature which is 
counterproductive to enzymatic breakdown [8]. From a 
cost standpoint, increasing temperature of reactions is 
not desired, rather catalysis near ambient conditions is 
preferred. This is especially true for remediation of plas -
tics in the environment where temperature cannot be 
controlled [49]. In our work, we have found that FAST-
PETase and Hot-PETase outperformed Is PETase based 
on soluble aromatics formed from PET microparticles at 
37 ºC, but reaction rates on 4-NPA were nearly the same 
at 25 ºC. Is PETase has been shown to be quite active at 
low temperatures, producing a high degree of ester bonds 
hydrolyzed in just minutes [50]. At lower temperatures, 
the advantages of the evolved PETases might not be as 
extreme as at higher temperatures where Is PETase, or 
even FAST-PETase are not stable [8].
Conclusions
Through this work we have shown that wild-type 
IsPETase is better produced in the cytoplasm of E. coli 
using a disulfide bond forming host with disulfide bond 
isomerase. Production was increased by 13-fold over 
often used BL21(DE3) and purity was enhanced due to 
overexpression. IsPETase was purified from SHuffle T7 
Express as a soluble, well-folded protein with activity 
on PET microparticles that is on par with other stud -
ies. Moving to another complex medium that was sup -
plemented with glycerol and to a controlled bioreactor, 
protein production reached 104 mg per liter after 46 h of 
culturing, with per cell mass productivities greater than 
what has been achieved with K. pastoris. The production 
benefit of SHuffle T7 Express was not found for evolved 
FAST-PETase and Hot-PETase, which were better made 
and purified from BL21(DE3). These results are expected 
to benefit researchers who need to produce signifi -
cant quantities of Is PETase and related variants in a lab 
environment for process engineering studies to degrade 
PET plastics at large scale.
