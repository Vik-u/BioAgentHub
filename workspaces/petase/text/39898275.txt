This study focuses on the biochemical characterization of a new hydrolase (Thb)
expressed from anaerobic Thermoanaerobacterales, which could be used to
improve biogas plant efﬁciency for plastic waste treatment. The speciﬁcity of Thb
for various polyesters, including polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polybutylene
adipate terephthalate (PBAT), polybutylene succinate (PBS), and polylactic acid
(PLA), was compared to the well-studied cutinase HiC fromHumicola insolens.
Based on gravimetric analysis and quanti ﬁcation (high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC)) of monomers solubilized upon enzymatic hydrolysis,
Thb was found to be more active on aromatic polyesters, while HiC led to a higher
amount of hydrolysis products on aliphatic polyesters (PBS and PLA). Polyester
hydrolysis was further investigated by scanning electron microscopy and infrared
spectroscopy. A comparison of the two enzyme structures indicated the higher
aromatic character of speciﬁc regions of the Thb surface as a possible reason for
these differences in speciﬁcity.

1 Introduction
Polyesters are widely used in food packaging materials due to many advantageous
characteristics, such as barrier properties. Bio-based and/or biodegradable polyesters offer
an environmentally friendly alternative to fossil-based recalcitrant polyethylene
terephthalate (PET), and their market shares are expected to triple in the next few
years in Europe (European bioplastics, 2023). The majority of food packaging products
are meant to be single use for safety concerns, contributing to crowd waste streams,
especially when contaminated with food residues. They are, therefore, preferentially treated
in composting or biogas plants; unfortunately, they constitute up to one-fourth of the total
plastic production (Ceballos-Santos et al., 2024). Yet, for example, PLA, the material with
the highest production capacity among biobased alternatives to PET (31% of total
bioplastics in 2023) (European bioplastics, 2023), is not home-compostable and requires
thermophilic conditions (Narancic et al., 2018). Likewise, in biogas plants, biobased/

biodegradable polyesters degrade well under thermophilic
conditions but may require longer treatment times ( Narancic
et al., 2018).
As shown for other polymers like lignocellulose/hemicellulose,
the addition of microorganisms specialized in decomposing these
polymers to biogas plants (i.e., bioaugmentation) can improve their
hydrolysis and enhance biogas yields as demonstrated in our group
and other works (Weiß et al., 2016). Likewise, we have shown that
the addition of anaerobicClostridium hathewayi, which produces
polyester-hydrolyzing enzymes, can boost the decomposition of
polyesters from packaging materials (e.g., PBAT) in biogas
reactors (Perz et al., 2016a). Thermophilic microorganisms with
these capabilities would be beneﬁcial because many biogas plants
operate at thermophilic conditions, and polyesters are hydrolyzed
faster at higher temperatures (close to their glass transition
temperature).
In the past, thermophilic mixed cellulolytic consortia were
enriched from an industrial-scale biogas fermenter (Strang et al.,
2017). Next-generation sequencing of the consortia revealed that the
main orders areThermoanaerobacterales and Clostridiales. Within
the consortia, the predominant strains were
Thermoanaerobacterium thermosaccharolyticum,
Caldanaerobacter subterraneus, Thermoanaerobacter
pseudethanolicus, and Clostridium cellulolyticum .
Bioaugmentation experiments showed that the consortia
enhanced the methane yield from corn stover by 22% –24%.
Strains from these phylogenetic orders might, therefore, also
improve the degradation of polyesters. A previous study has
shown that Clostridia, more speci ﬁcally C. hathewayi , can
degrade PBAT, mostly applied in ﬂexible food packaging bags
(Perz et al., 2016a). The activity of polymers is based on the
presence of enzymes that these microbes produce and usually
secrete. For example, an esterase was isolated from the above-
mentioned C. hathewayi that hydrolyzes the synthetic
compostable polyester PBAT. Two further hydrolases with PBAT
cleavage capacity were identiﬁed fromClostridium botulinum(Perz
et al., 2016b). Such polyester-hydrolyzing enzymes could also have a
potential for recovery of polyester building blocks to be then
separately collected (e.g., from blended textiles or multilayer
materials) (Pellis et al., 2023).
In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in exploiting
novel biotechnological technologies, ranging from metagenome
screening to enzyme engineering, in order to make enzymatic
recycling of “recalcitrant” PET industrially feasible (Biundo et al.,
2018; Sonnendecker et al., 2022; Arnal et al., 2023). Cutinases from
Humicola insolens, Thermobiﬁda cellulosilytica,o r Thermobiﬁda
fusca showed enhanced depolymerization activity from 55
°Ct o
70°C and against moderately crystalline PET substrates (Romano
et al., 2023). Conversely,lsPETase fromIdeonella sakaiensis (Yang
et al., 2016) retains the ability to catalyze PET hydrolysis at milder
temperatures. The leaf and branch compost (LCC) and
PHL7 cutinases, which both originated from the metagenomic
screening of compost, outperformed the previously mentioned
ones, at least for PET hydrolysis in the range 65
°C–70°C, close to

the PET glass transition temperature (Tg). Yet, there is still a need to
expand our knowledge about polyester hydrolyzing enzymes from
microorganisms originating from different ecosystems.
Therefore, to better understand the fate of different polyesters
from packaging waste under anaerobic conditions, we have
investigated a polyester hydrolyzing enzyme from an anaerobic
zone of a thermophilic composting plant (Martins et al., 2013).
The enzyme, named Thb, originates from a member of the anaerobic
Thermoanaerobacterales, which can grow at up to 80
°C and was
characterized in terms of its ideal reaction conditions (temperature,
buffer, and pH). The speciﬁcity of this enzyme was investigated on
aliphatic and aromatic polyesters and compared to the well-
characterized H. insolens cutinase. Therefore, the hydrolysis of
PET of the aliphatic polyesters PLA and PBS and of PBAT as
aliphatic/aromatic copolyester was compared. The results should
both be valuable as a basis for the development or modiﬁcation
(Arnal et al., 2023) of new polyester active enzymes as well as for
bioaugmentation strategies in anaerobic processes.
2 Materials and methods
2.1 Chemicals and polymers
Buffer components (K2HPO4 and KH2PO4, Trizma base, and
NaCl), bovine serum albumin (BSA), andp-nitrophenol butyrate
(p-NPB) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). Amorphous
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and crystalline PET (crystallinity
> 50%, size < 300 µm) were purchased from Goodfellow.
Polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT) was purchased from
BASF, and polylactic acid (PLA) and mixed waste containing PET
(MW) were provided by AIMPLAS. Lysogeny broth (LB),
kanamycin, and isopropyl- β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Germany), whileEscherichia coli
BL21-Gold (DE3) competent cells were purchased from Agilent.
Chemicals for fermentation media and semisynthetic medium
were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Germany) where not
otherwise speciﬁed.
2.2 Polymer preparation
Polyester ﬁlms were sized to 0.5 cm × 1 cm, washed in Triton X-
100 (5 g/L) and sodium carbonate (100 mM), and rinsed with
ultrapure water. Additionally, the same polymers were cryomilled
with two cycles of 1:30 min each with a frequency of 30 s
−1, with a
1 min at 5 s−1 cooling step in between. Powders were afterward
homogenized with a sieve of 500 µm pore size. Crystalline PET was
already available as a powder with<300 µm size.
2.3 Expression and puriﬁcation of the
hydrolase Thb fromThermoanaerobacterales
2.3.1 Expression of Thb inEscherichia coli and in
working cell bank
A hydrolase from Thermoanaerobacterales (Thb, NCBI
accession number MBO2503201.1) was codon-optimized for
E. coli and cloned with an N-terminal Strep-tag over the
restriction sites NdeI and HindIII into vector pET26b (+),
yielding pET26b (+)_Strep_Thb, and expressed in competent
E. coli BL21-Gold (DE3) as previously reported (Biundo et al.,
2016). A ﬁrst 24-h pre-culture in LB medium (total volume
10 mL LB) supplemented with kanamycin (40 μg/mL) as a
selection marker was followed by the preparation of a main
culture with a starting OD
600 of 0.1. After 16-h growth at 37°C,
150 rpm in Erlenmeyerﬂasks (total volume 200 mL LB), the clones
were induced with 0.08 mM IPTG and allowed to grow at a lower
temperature (20
°C) while shaking at 150 rpm. The harvesting of the
cells was done by aliquoting the total 200 mL cell culture into 50-mL
Falcon tubes, which were centrifuged at 3,700 rpm, 4
°C, 20 min.
For the larger volume expression, 2 mL of working cell bank
(WCB) of the employed production strain (enGenes e X-press
V2 with pET26b (+)_Strep_Thb plasmid) were added to 30 mL
of semi-synthetic medium (SSM) (Supplementary Table S1, ESI)
containing 50 μg/mL kanamycin in a 500-mL bafﬂed boom ﬂask.
The pre-culture was incubated for 5 h at 37
°C and 200 rpm. For the
inoculation of 500 mL batch medium (composition see
Supplementary Tables S2, S3 , ESI) in the 2-L benchtop
bioreactors (DASGIP Bioblock, Eppendorf SE, Hamburg,
Germany), the OD
600 of the pre-culture was measured, and an
amount of cell suspension equaling 25 OD600 units was used. The
temperature was kept at 37 (±0.2)°C. The pH control was set to 7.0
(±0.1) and regulated by dosing 12.5% ammonia solution. The
dissolved oxygen (DO) cascade was designed to maintain the DO
at 30% byﬁrst accelerating the stirrer speed (400–1,200 rpm), then
increasing the airﬂow rate (10–200 sL/h), andﬁnally increasing the
oxygen concentration in the gasﬂow (21%–100%). Foaming in the
reactor was kept under control by dosing antifoam agent (1:
10 diluted, Struktol J673A, Schill + Seilacher, Böblingen,
Germany) when needed. The ﬁrst feed was started immediately
after the batch phase ended with a cell dry weight (CDW) of 10 g/L
reached in 8.25 h. Two feed phases were employed. First, an
exponential feed phase (µ = 0.135 h
−1) was used to reach a
biomass of 40 g/L of CDW in the bioreactor. Subsequently, a
linear feed proﬁle was set (ﬁxed feed rate of 0.12 g glucose/min,
30
°C, and pH 6.5). With the start of the linear feed, the growth of the
host cells was halted by the addition of 10 mM arabinose to express
the T7 phage protein Gp2, thereby decoupling growth and
recombinant protein production. In parallel, the enzyme
expression was induced with 1.2 µmol IPTG/g CDW. The ﬁrst
sample was taken right before induction as a reference and to
determine possible basal expression of Thb. Further samples were
drawn every 2 hours for a maximum of 10 hours. After 10 h, the
fermentation broth was harvested by separating the cells from the
medium via centrifugation (15,400 g for 1 h at 10
°C). The biomass
and supernatant were frozen separately at −20°C until further
processing.
2.3.2 Puriﬁcation of expression-derived biomass
for Thb isolation
The pellet was then recovered, weighed, and resuspended in
buffer W (100 mM Tris HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 8) in a 5 mL per 1 g
ratio. The mixture was sonicated in an ice cooling environment in
10 cycles each of 10 s, with 2 min interruptions in between each cycle
(SONICATOR BRANSON Ultrasonics cell disruptor (USA)). The
Frontiers inBioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org03
Siracusa et al. 10.3389/fbioe.2024.1520680
sonicated material was removed from cell fragments and debris via
centrifugation (12,000 rpm. 4°C, 20 min) and furtherﬁltered with a
PES ﬁlter (pore size 0.2 µm, Nalgene) before being loaded onto a
column for afﬁnity chromatography in the AEKTA puriﬁcation
system, as the enzyme was provided with a Strep-tag. The elution
was done through the addition of buffer W, which was implemented
with biotin. The afﬁnity chromatography column (Strep-Tactin
® XT
Sepharose, volume 5 mL, Cytiva) in use was provided with a Strep-
tag afﬁne matrix to capture the Strep-tagged enzymes. The eluted
fractions were pooled and concentrated through an ultraﬁltration
ﬁlter (Amicon, 10 kDa cutoff Merck, Germany). Before storage
at −20
°C, the buffer was changed into 100 mM potassium phosphate
(KPO) pH 8.0 by the use of PD-10 desalting columns (PD-
10 desalting column, Cytiva). The cutinase from H. insolens
(HiC) was from Novozymes and used without any further
treatment. The efﬁciency of puriﬁcation was tested through an
activity assay using p-NPB as substrate and by SDS-Page. Load,
ﬂowthrough, and eluted fractions were diluted in Laemmli buffer
with 2-mercaptoethanol (Information, 2000) and loaded onto pre-
cast gels (Mini-PROTEAN TGX Stain-Free, Bio-Rad), run at 150 V
for 30 min. The protein marker IV (Peqlab, Germany) was the
reference for the molecular weight bands.
2.4 Protein quantiﬁcation, activity, and
temperature stability
The protein concentrations of both the HiC and eluted Thb
fractions were estimated through a Bradford-based Bio-Rad
Protein Assay (Bio-Rad Labo ratories GmbH, Munich,
Germany) using bovine serum albumin (BSA) as the standard.
The activity of HiC was measured in the ﬁnal buffer used for
polyester hydrolysis (1M KP O), while Thb activity was
characterized in different buffe rs and molarities. The substrate
for all the assays was p-nitrophenyl butyrate ( p-NPB), and the
volumes in use were kept constant for all the samples: the enzyme
was diluted accordingly into the buffer of analysis (at set pH and
molarity). The volume of each sample was 20 μL, placed in
triplicate in a 96-well plate. A 200- μLa l i q u o to fp-NPB
containing solution (obtained diluting the substrate in the
buffer of interest) was added to the samples and to a triplicate
set of blanks (buffer only), and the increase of absorbance was
recorded for 5 min at 405 nm on a plate reader (Tecan inﬁnite
M200, Tecan Austria GmbH). The same measurement was
repeated after dilution in pre -heated buffers (ranging from
50
°Ct o6 0°C–70°C). The results were expressed in units (U)
per mL, where U corresponds to the amount of enzyme that
catalyzes 1 µmol of substrate per minute. Thermostability was
also evaluated through activity assessment for 72 h (with time
points at 0 h, 6 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h) to evaluate the loss of
activity in a real incubation set-up, in the buffers in which the
activity was measured as the highest. The values obtained
through the p-NPB assay after each time point were measured
and compared to the assessed initial one (indicated as 0 h) and
assumed as 100%. These measurements were performed on
enzyme fractions incubated at 30
°C, 50°C, and 70°C.
2.5 Enzymatic hydrolysis of polyesters
Polyester powders were incubated in 2-mL Eppendorf tubes
with a total reaction volume of 2 mL, where Thb or HiC was diluted
to 1 µM ﬁnal concentration. The ﬁlms were sized to be 1 cm ×
0.5 cm, while 10 mg of each powdered polymer was incubated in the
same buffer volume. The buffer in use was 1 M KPO pH 8. The
Eppendorf tubes were placed horizontally in an orbital shaker
incubator at 70
°C and 150 rpm shaking. Hydrolysis of the
powder polymers was performed also with Phl7, expressed and
produced in E. coli as described in (Fohler et al., 2024).
2.6 Analysis of weight loss and
released monomers
After incubation of the polyester samples, they were washed in
the three subsequent steps as summarized for the preparation prior
to hydrolysis to remove any possible attached residuals. The
polymers were dried and weighed to compare with the original
weight and to calculate their mass loss, which was reported as a
percentage. The released monomers were quantiﬁed by using high-
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in two different
settings. An Agilent Technologies 1260 Inﬁnity instrument was
used in combination with a C18 reversed-phase column.
Terephthalic acid (TPA) was detected via a UV lamp, and the
method used was based on a gradient of methanol and 0.1% formic
acid (ﬂow 0.85 mL/min), with an injection volume of 10 µL. The
samples were diluted in methanol and acidiﬁed with 30 µL 6 N HCl
before being centrifuged at 4
°C (15 min and 14,000 rpm) andﬁltered
through 0.2-µm polyamide ﬁlters into HPLC vials. All other
monomers were detected through their refractive index (using a
Transgenomic IC SEP-ION-300 and a mobile phase of 0.01 N
H
2SO4, with a ﬂow rate of 0.325 mL/min, 45 °C). The Carrez
protocol was used to remove proteins through the addition of
potassium hexacyanoferrate (II) trihydrate and zinc sulfate
heptahydrate reagents. The samples were centrifuged for 30 min
at 4
°C and 14,000 rpm beforeﬁltering into HPLC vials through 0.2-
µm polyamide ﬁlters. Calibration curves were prepared with serial
dilution of all monomers (individually either in buffer or ultrapure
water according to each monomer detection protocol) and used to
estimate their concentrations in the hydrolysates.
2.7 Model structure comparison
A homology model of Thb was created with the Swiss model
server (Waterhouse et al., 2018) in the automated mode. The crystal
structure of PHL7, entry 8BRA in the protein databank, with a
sequence identity of 90%, was used as a template; seeSupplementary
Figure S1in the supporting material for the sequence alignment. The
obtained model showed a QMEANDisco score of 0.87 (Studer et al.,
2020). An Alphafold 3 (Abramson et al., 2024) model for Thb was
also reported. The resulting model was compared to the crystal
structure of HiC, with PDB code 4OYY, by aligning the catalytic
triads of both models.

3 Results
The large variety of available metagenomic databases can facilitate
the identiﬁcation of new microbial enzymes in speciﬁc environments,
reducing the strict need for complex functional screenings. Suchin silico
screening based on already known polyester hydrolases was applied in
this study to identify a new thermostable polymer hydrolase in an
anaerobic consortium. In the course of the screening, starting with an
“anaerobic” polyester hydrolyzing enzyme that we had previously
identiﬁed in C. hathewayi, an alpha/beta hydrolase from the
Thermoanaerobacterales bacterium (accession number
MBO2503201.1) was identiﬁed in a compost (anaerobic zone)
metagenome (Martins et al., 2013) and named Thb. Hydrolase Thb
has only low homologies to the hydrolase fromC. hathewayi(18%), the
esterase A from C. botulinum (25%), and the Humicola insulens
cutinase (23%). In comparison, the homologies to IsPETase (60%),
LCC (65%), and PHL7 (90%) are signiﬁcantly higher. The enzyme was
produced in E. coli and characterized, and the speciﬁcities were
compared with HiC.
3.1 Expression of Thb inEscherichia coliand
puriﬁcation
Afﬁnity-based puriﬁcation by an N-terminal Strep-tag yielded a
pure protein with a molecular weight of 35 kDa according to SDS-
PAGE analysis (Supplementary Figure S2(ESI)). While the small-
scale culture (total volume 200 mL in shake ﬂasks) gave
2.64 mg
enzyme/Lculture or alternatively 0.27 mgenzyme/gbiomass, this
yield was signiﬁcantly improved when the culture was upscaled to
the 2 L bioreactor with overall better control of the parameters and
optimized media component (Supplementary Tables S1–S3). The
ﬁnal puri ﬁed enzyme was, in fact, 33 mg enzyme/Lculture or
0.84 mgenzyme/gbiomass from the bioreactor cell biomass, proving
that the upscale was not only possible but also allowed higher
ﬁnal yields.
The speciﬁc activity onp-NPB as a substrate (1 M KPO buffer,
pH 8, T 70
°C) was 54.1 U/mg. The activity based on the same model
substrate ( p-NPB) was also compared in various incubation
conditions regarding buffer type (Tris HCl and KPO), molarity,
temperature, and pH. The most suitable environment proved to be
KPO, for which the highest activity of 152.5 U/mg was found on
100 mM KPO pH 8 and 60
°C( Supplementary Figure S3, ESI). The
better results for KPO than Tris HCl conﬁrmed the previousﬁnding
of a putative inhibitory effect of Tris HCl on enzyme activity in favor
of the adoption of KPO, whose phosphate ions were expected to
stabilize the enzymes (Schmidt et al., 2016; Gamerith et al., 2017;
Weinberger et al., 2017).
Thermostability at speciﬁc temperatures and conditions was
tested in the next step. In agreement with previous results (Daniel
and Danson, 2013 ; Schmidt et al., 2016 ; Ismail et al., 2024 ),
enhanced stability was seen at the highest KPO molarity of 1M
(50
°C: 10.8 U/mg; 60°C: 48.7 U/mg; 70°C: 54.1 U/mg), while a
reported large stabilization effect of Ca2+ (Sonnendecker et al., 2022)
could not be con ﬁrmed when CaCl 2 was added to a ﬁnal
concentration of 2 mM.
In addition, the p-NPB assay was also carried out under the
incubation conditions used for polymer hydrolysis (1 µM
concentration in the presence of PET stripe (1 cm × 0.5 cm)
with time points at 6 h, 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h (Supplementary
Figure S4A). Additionally, 30 °C and 50 °C were considered to
monitor the effect of temperature on the long-term stability
(Supplementary Figures S4B, 4C ). Thb and HiC followed a
similar trend regarding stability. After 6 h of reaction, the activity
on p-NPB decreased by more than 50%, while at the end of the
incubation (72 h), the residual activity was 20% for Thb and<5% for
HiC. Lower temperatures also caused signi ﬁcant activity loss
(Supplementary Figures S4B, 4C ). In particular, while the
stability of HiC at 50
°C was retained >10% for the whole
experiment (owing to various additives and stabilizers in the
commercial formulation), Thb at the same temperature was
barely active at 48 h, maintaining a low basal activity until 72 h
when compared with the initial one. These results conﬁrmed the
destabilization of the enzyme in buffer at high temperature for
longer incubation time, which is a common response of enzymes to
heat. However, a sharp decrease in the residual activity in the
reaction mixture may also indicate partial adsorption of the
enzyme on the present PET. Moreover, it must be taken into
account that the activity assay onp-NPB was carried out on an
aliquot of the soluble fraction of the enzyme, which only estimated
the actual available free enzyme and could be affected by several
parameters throughout the duration of the incubation. Therefore, in
the next step, the activity of the polymer was assessedvia weight loss
and released monomer.
3.2 Hydrolysis of different aromatic and
aliphatic polyesters
The speciﬁcity of Thb on a range of aromatic or aliphatic
polyesters was compared to the H. insolens cutinase, which has
been well studied for polyester hydrolysis. Previously (Marten et al.,
2005; Gigli et al., 2019 ), a higher susceptibility to enzymatic
hydrolysis was reported for aliphatic polyesters than the aromatic
polyester. Weight loss and soluble molecules released from the
polyesters were quantiﬁed to assess whether Thb followed this
hypothesis.
3.2.1 Weight loss and surface changes of
polyester ﬁlms
The polymerﬁlms recovered after the hydrolysis were washed as
in the preparation step. PET, PBAT, and PLA were hydrolyzed to
different extents by Thb and HiC. PET was completely hydrolyzed
by Thb after 48 h (Supplementary Figure S5), while a maximum
weight loss of only 38% was seen for HiC after the same incubation
time. In agreement with these data, higher hydrolysis rates were
previously reported for the PHL7, which is closely related (90%) to
Thb (Sonnendecker et al., 2022) when compared to HiC. In contrast,
a slightly faster decomposition of PLA was seen for HiC when
compared to Thb; its mass was reduced by approx. 25% vs. 17% after
72 h of incubation. Likewise, the aliphatic/aromatic polyester PBAT
was decomposed faster by HiC, even though both enzymes led to
complete decomposition after 24 h. For crystalline PET, only a
marginal weight loss was seen for both enzymes (data not shown).
FT-IR spectra and SEM micrographs were acquired for the
residual polymers. As shown in Figure 1, PLA-superimposed
Frontiers inBioengineering and Biotechnology frontiersin.org05
Siracusa et al. 10.3389/fbioe.2024.1520680
spectra for both enzyme-catalyzed reactions showed clear changes in
peaks related to ester and free carboxylic group, namely, an increase
in 1,620 cm
−1 peak intensity (formation of free carbonyl groups from
ester bond hydrolysis). Under SEM, PLA, and PBAT showed
different patterns of surface erosion, especially PBAT, where the
Thb-treated samples had deeper but less densely distributed cavities

(Figure 1; Supplementary Figures S6–S8). Micrographs of PLA
displayed instead an enhanced bulk decomposition with a
homogeneous sponge-like structure after 48 h ( Figure 3C ).
Regarding PLA hydrolyzed by HiC, a more dispersed pattern
with deeper pores was seen after 72 h, which can be associated
with locations of degradation (Figure 3C). Even though the aspect of
the specimen at the SEM would indicate a more pronounced
decomposition by Thb, according to weight loss and HPLC
results, HiC was more active on PLA. Indeed, we have previously
shown that on the same polyester, different enzymes may prefer
acting “horizontally”on the surface or“vertically,”leading to crater-
like structures (Zumstein et al., 2017). Similar results were recorded
in the reactions conducted in the presence of 2 mM CaCl
2
(Supplementary Figure S7), suggesting the poor inﬂuence of a
metal-dependent stabilizer effect in the applied settings.
3.2.2 Released monomers
In agreement with the weight loss measurements, more than
three times higher amounts of terephthalic acid (TPA) were released
from the aromatic polyester PET by Thb than by HiC (Figure 2).
Similar results were obtained for the hydrolysis ofﬁlms (examples of
chromatograms are available in Supplementary Figure S9, and
plotted histograms forﬁlms can be seen inSupplementary Figure
S10). Again, Thb caused a 3-fold higher released TPA from the PET

ﬁlm, while it was outperformed by HiC by more than 2-fold in the
case of PLA hydrolysis. As expected, the aliphatic polyesters PLA
and PBS were hydrolyzed signiﬁcantly faster by HiC. For example,
0.4 mg/mL lactic acid (LA) hydrolyzed from PLA by HiC compared
to only 0.2 mg/mL LA hydrolyzed by Thb were released after 72 h of
incubation. In general, PBS was hydrolyzed faster by HiC than by
Thb, leading to 0.4 mg/mL succinic acid (SA) after 6 h of incubation
versus 0.1 mg/mL SA seen for Thb. The polyester PBAT containing
both aromatic and aliphatic bonds was hydrolyzed better by Thb
because almost double the amount of TPA was found in soluble
form in the Thb hydrolysate after 72 h. This trend was conﬁrmed by
incubation at lower concentrations of the enzyme (Supplementary
Figure S11, ESI).
Interestingly, both enzymes were also able to release monomers
from mixed waste primarily containing PET: as expected, a higher
amount was released from a Thb-catalyzed reaction (3.4 mg/mL
TPA after 72 h) than HiC (1.6 mg/mL TPA), while both enzymes
were generally slightly more active on the PET fraction of the mixed
waste than on the PET standard. Finally, roughly ten times less
monomers were released by the enzymes from crystalline PET,
conﬁrming the reported recalcitrance of crystalline regions
toward enzymatic hydrolysis ( Hwang et al., 2022 ). Yet, in
agreement with the above results, Thb was more active on
crystalline PET than HiC, with 0.4 mg/mL TPA traced in the
hydrolysate after 72 h (0.2 mg/mL TPA after 72 h from HiC).
Although a proportional relationship between weight loss and
released monomers was expected, enzymatic hydrolysis mayﬁrst
release soluble oligomers (which were not quantiﬁed here), which
are afterward exo-wisely cleaved into monomers (Gigli et al., 2019).
This may explain why, for PBAT, a higher weight loss was seen for
HiC while a higher number of monomers was released by Thb. Yet,
for PET and PLA, the release of monomers correlated with the
FIGURE 3

weight losses. The incubation with 2 mM CaCl2 (HiC and Thb kept
at the same concentration of 1 µM) resulted in no differences in
terms of released monomers, conﬁrming the weight lossﬁndings.
Reactions performed at 30
°C are reported inSupplementary Figure
S12, with a two-fold up to almost ten-fold decrease in hydrolytic
efﬁciency when the amounts of released monomers are measured.
To place the study in the context with other polyester
hydrolyzing enzymes, the activity of Thb was compared to Phl7
(Sonnendecker et al., 2022), which is the most closely related (90%)
of the recently developed enzymes. When incubated at identical
conditions (1M KPO, pH 8, 70
°C), Phl7 was slightly more active on
PET than Thb but less active on PBAT, PLA, and PBS
(Supplementary Figure S13). The activity of Phl7 has previously
been compared to other recently developed enzymes, such as LCC,
which caused about 30% less weight loss of PET under the same
conditions (https://doi.org/10.1002/cssc.202101062).
Increasing amounts of the different polyesters were incubated
with equal concentrations of the enzymes. A constant enzyme
amount with higher amounts of polyesters led to a higher
monomer release, except for PBAT, where a plateau was reached
(Supplementary Figure S14).
3.3 Modeling Thb and HiC
The overlay of the HiC structure with the one from Thb
displayed signi ﬁcant differences between the two enzymes,
offering a structural interpretation of their different speciﬁcity on
aromatic and aliphatic polyesters. Strikingly, the HiC catalytic triad
(Ser105, Asp160, and His173) aligned almost perfectly with that
from Thb (Figure 3A). The Thbɑ/β-hydrolase fold, in which the
catalytic triad Ser131-His208-Asp177 is located, is conserved in
other PET hydrolyzing enzymes. S131 provides the nucleophile site,
while the acid D177 stabilizes the base H208 (Han et al., 2017)
(Figure 3B). The Alphafold 3 model was virtually identical to the
homology model, giving a root-mean-square deviation after an
alignment of 0.16 Å (Supplementary Figure S15).
Serine hydrolases generally possess a cleft that determines
substrate speci ﬁcity. A surface representation is displayed in
Figures 3C, D, where aromatic groups (Phe, Tyr, or Trp) are
shown in magenta. Thb (Figure 3C) displays a shallow but wide
cleft with a larger number of aromatic groups than HiC (Figure 3D).
A wide and shallow but aromatic cleft can explain the preference for
aromatic substrates of Thb, while the more pronounced cleft of HiC
could preferentially accommodate less bulky, aliphatic substrates.
The co-crystallization of PHL7 with TPA was already carried out
and demonstrates the interaction between the enzyme active site and
its substrate. I179, W156, D177, H209, A131, F63, and M132 are
responsible for the direct interaction of the enzyme with TPA
(Richter et al., 2023 ). These are well-conserved in the Thb
structure; therefore, the hydrolytic activity is not disrupted by the
slight divergence between the two homologous proteins.
4 Conclusion
A new polyester hydrolyzing enzyme from
Thermoanaerobacterales (Thb) derived from the metagenome
from an anaerobic zone of a thermophilic compost plant was
heterologously expressed and puriﬁed. Interestingly, Thb shows a
clear preference for aromatic po lyesters based on weight loss
measurements and on the amount of monomers released when
compared to the well-studied cutinase HiC. Combined with
information obtained from struc ture/function analysis, this
knowledge should facilitate future enzyme engineering towards
speciﬁcity on desired polyesters. Moreover, thermophilic
anaerobic microorganisms secreting polyester hydrolyzing
enzymes could be used for bioaugmentation in biogas plants
towards enhanced decomposi tion of polyester-based
packaging materials.
