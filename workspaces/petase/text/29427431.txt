ABSTRACT Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the most important synthetic
polymers used today. Unfortunately, the polymers accumulate in nature and to date
no highly active enzymes are known that can degrade it at high velocity. Enzymes
involved in PET degradation are mainly
/H9251- and /H9252-hydrolases, like cutinases and re-
lated enzymes (EC 3.1.1). Currently, only a small number of such enzymes are well
characterized. In this work, a search algorithm was developed that identiﬁed 504
possible PET hydrolase candidate genes from various databases. A further global
search that comprised more than 16 Gb of sequence information within 108 marine
and 25 terrestrial metagenomes obtained from the Integrated Microbial Genome
(IMG) database detected 349 putative PET hydrolases. Heterologous expression of
four such candidate enzymes veriﬁed the function of these enzymes and conﬁrmed
the usefulness of the developed search algorithm. In this way, two novel and thermo-
stable enzymes with high potential for downstream application were partially character-
ized. Clustering of 504 novel enzyme candidates based on amino acid similarities indi-
cated that PET hydrolases mainly occur in the phyla ofActinobacteria, Proteobacteria,
and Bacteroidetes. Within theProteobacteria, theBetaproteobacteria, Deltaproteobacte-
ria, and Gammaproteobacteria were the main hosts. Remarkably enough, in the ma-
rine environment, bacteria afﬁliated with the phylumBacteroidetes appear to be the
main hosts of PET hydrolase genes, rather thanActinobacteria or Proteobacteria,a s
observed for the terrestrial metagenomes. Our data further imply that PET hydro-
lases are truly rare enzymes. The highest occurrence of 1.5 hits/Mb was observed in
sequences from a sample site containing crude oil.
IMPORTANCE Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) accumulates in our environment with-
out signiﬁcant microbial conversion. Although a few PET hydrolases are already known,
it is still unknown how frequently they appear and with which main bacterial phyla they
are afﬁliated. In this study, deep sequence mining of protein databases and meta-
genomes demonstrated that PET hydrolases indeed occur at very low frequencies in the
environment. Furthermore, it was possible to link them to phyla that were previously
not known to harbor such enzymes. This work contributes novel knowledge on the phy-
logenetic relationships, the recent evolution, and the global distribution of PET hydro-
lases. Finally, we describe the biochemical traits of four novel PET hydrolases.

ince its discovery, its ﬁrst synthesis, and its patenting in 1941, polyethylene tereph-
thalate (PET) has become a widely used material in several industrial branches (1).
The worldwide PET resin production amounted to 27.8 million tons in 2015 (https://
www.plasticsinsight.com/global-pet-resin-production-capacity).
Due to its massive use, PET is highly enriched in nature. Microplastics and bigger
fragments of plastic are found worldwide in oceans and terrestrial environments. The
most prominent example is the so-called Paciﬁc garbage patch. PET debris is often
eaten by ﬁsh and other marine creatures (
2, 3). In this way, PET degradation products
and additives (i.e., solubilizers) are introduced into the food chain, where they have
negative impact on human and animal health (
4). Until now, only a few species of
bacteria and fungi have been described as capable of partially degrading PET to
oligomers or even monomers (
5). Within this framework, however, it is noteworthy that
all known PET hydrolases have relatively low turnover rates, which makes their use for
efﬁcient bioremediation almost impossible (
Table 1).
Intriguingly, the trait for PET degradation appears to be limited to a few bacterial
phyla, and most bacterial isolates with potential for PET degradation are members of
the Gram-positive phylumActinobacteria (
12). The best-characterized examples origi-
nate from the generaThermobiﬁda and Thermomonospora (8, 10–12, 15, 16)( Table 1).
The enzymes involved in the degradation (e.g., PET hydrolase and tannase) are typical
serine hydrolases, e.g., cutinases (EC 3.1.1.74), lipases (EC 3.1.1.3), and carboxylesterases
(EC 3.1.1.1). These enzymes possess a typical
/H9251//H9252-hydrolase fold, and the catalytic triad
is composed of a serine, a histidine, and an aspartate residue (17, 18).
More recently, polyethylene (PE)-degrading bacteria were reported in insect guts. In
this recent study, Enterobacteria and Bacillus strains had been isolated and were
capable of degrading polyesters (19, 20).
Furthermore,acompletedegradationofamorphousPETmaterialswasdescribedfor
theGram-negativebacterium Ideonella sakaiensisstrain201-F6,whichisabletousePET
as a major energy and carbon source (13). In addition to the hydrolase, theI. sakaiensis
genome encodes a second enzyme that appears to be unique, and which is designated
as a tannase capable of degrading mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid. In this way,
the secreted PET hydrolase produces the intermediate mono(2-hydroxyethyl) tere-
phthalic acid (MHET). MHET is presumably internalized by the cell and hydrolyzed by
theMHETase.Theresultingmonomersarethendegradedinadownstreamprocessand

teobacteria and belongs to the orderBurkholderiales.
In this work, our intention was to mine metagenomes for the detection of novel
genes involved in PET degradation and to establish an overview on their taxonomic
distributionwithinthedifferentbacterialphyla.Therefore,wehavedevelopedahidden
Markov model (HMM) to search existing genome and metagenome databases for the
presence of potential PET hydrolases (
Fig. 1; see alsoFig. 3B). Using this approach, we
identiﬁed /H11022500 potential PET hydrolases in the UniProtKB database. In addition, 349
sequence homologs were obtained from several public metagenome data sets depos-
ited on the IMG server, and four of the identiﬁed candidate genes were functionally
veriﬁed. Together, these results imply that PET hydrolase genes are globally distributed
in marine and terrestrial metagenomes.Furthermore, we provide evidence that in
marine environments, the PET hydrolases originate mainly from the phylumBacte-
roidetes and in the terrestrial metagenomes from Actinobacteria .
RESULTS
Construction of a hidden Markov model for PET hydrolases.Only a few well-
characterized PET hydrolases are currently known. The most prominent examples are
PET hydrolases fromT. fusca and I. sakaiensis (see references in
Table 1and Fig. 2). In
this study, we set out to increase knowledge of the diversity of this intriguing group of
hydrolases. To identify potential novel PET hydrolases, an amino acid sequence align-
ment of nine already-known examples was constructed using the T-Coffee multiple
sequence alignment server. The enzyme sequences used for the model all have veriﬁed

activity on PET-based substrates (Table 1). Of the proteins used for the model, seven
sequences originated from the phylumActinobacteria (i.e., sequences 1 to 7;Table 1)
andonefromthephylum Proteobacteria (Betaproteobacteria)(sequence8; Table1),and
one sequence (AEV21261) encoded a protein with a metagenomic origin not yet
assigned to any phylum (sequence 9,Table 1). A comparison with the well-described
PET-active cutinase TfCut2 fromThermobiﬁda fusca allowed the identiﬁcation of the
locationofthecatalytictriadandotherresiduesthatarecommonlyinvolvedinbinding
of the substrates (
Fig. 3A). Next to the serine of the catalytic triad in every sequence, a
methionine residue was found, which is of importance for forming an oxyanion hole
together with an aromatic residue. This aromatic residue is also part of an aromatic
clamp, together with similar amino acids like tryptophan, tyrosine, histidine, and
phenylalanine (
17, 21). Terminal cysteine residues are present in all examples and may

for the construction of a hidden Markov model. For visualization, an HMM logo was
created via the Skylign online tool (

analysis and conservation prediction using the JS divergence scoring method revealed
at least eight conserved regions (

An initial HMMER online tool database search with the model against the UniProtKB
database revealed a total of 10,854 signiﬁcant query matches, with a highest bit score
value of 441.6. Of these, a subset was chosen that showed a bit score value of/H11022180.
In addition, a BLAST search was performed using the newly discovered potential PET
hydrolases from the HMM search as initial query sequences against the nonredundant
and the metagenomic datasets available at the NCBI database in May 2017. This
resulted in the detection of 504 potential PET hydrolase candidate genes. From the
obtained homologous sequences, 13 potential PET hydrolase homologs (
Fig. 2) were
manually chosen due to their sequence similarity to known PET hydrolases (PET1 to
PET13). These were used for initial veriﬁcation and furtherin silico and/or biochemical
characterization. These novel predicted PET hydrolases are summarized in Table S1 in
the supplemental material, together with their UniProt entries and pfam domain
similarities. It was of interest to select mainly nonactinobacterial proteins, in order to
diversify the HMM. These 13 sequences were added to the alignment and used for a
FIG 2 Neighbor-joining tree of manually chosen potential PET hydrolase sequences found in this work. Sequences were obtained from
a HMM search in the UniProtKB database and named PET1 to PET13. The tree was calculated using MEGA6. Besides the 13 newly found
PET hydrolase sequences (Table S1), 9 already-known PET hydrolases (
Table 1) were added to the tree in order to visualize the
phylogenetic distribution and similarity of the PET hydrolase sequence homologs.

the above-mentioned residues and motifs (listed inTable 2).

hydrolases_5 (pfam12695). Of these, only PET9 and PET12 showed speciﬁc hits for the
superfamily of acetyl xylan esterases (AXE1, pfam05448). In addition to the speciﬁc hits,
several nonspeciﬁc domain hits were obtained (Table S1).

the subclasses were mainly afﬁliated withActinobacteria, and only one subclass (XII)
was associated with Proteobacteria. For the subclass XVII, no clear assignment was
possible. TheThermobiﬁda PET hydrolase sequences are clustered within subcluster XV,
together with the PET hydrolase fromSaccharomonospora. The leaf compost cutinase
(LCC) sequence was found in subcluster XI and the Thermomonospora curvata se-
quence is located in group XII. The PET hydrolase from Ideonella sakaiensis is
located in subcluster VI.

Experimental veriﬁcation of the HMM and characterization of selected novel
PET hydrolases.Since the bioinformatic approach only delivered potential PET hydro-
lases enzymes, we initiated work to verify a small number of the identiﬁed candidate
genes with respect to their function. Therefore, we chose the enzymes PET 2, 5, 6, and
12 (Table S1). The respective genes were either synthesized or ampliﬁed from genomic
DNA using vectors and primers (as outlined in
Tables 3and4) and were cloned into the
expression vectors. Initial tests indicated that all genes coded for active enzymes. On
agar plates containing PET nanoparticles or polycaprolactone (PCL) (
9, 24), all active
clones produced halos after overnight incubation. They were compared to the PET
hydrolase fromThermobiﬁda fuscaas a positive control (see Fig. S1 in the supplemental
material). PCL was used as a model substrate, as hydrolysis of this compound indicates
possible activities on the more complex PET. From these active enzymes, we chose two
enzymes for more detailed biochemical characterization. These were the two enzymes
PET 2 and PET 6. PET 2 was derived from a marine metagenomics data set (
25), and PET
6 was derived fromVibrio gazogenesstrain DSM-21264 (26). After successful expression
and puriﬁcation of the two enzymes in sufﬁcient amounts, the obtained enzymes were
further characterized usingpara-nitrophenyl esters (pNP esters) (
Fig. 5; see also Fig. S2
and S3 in the supplemental material). Both enzymes showed best activity againstpNP
esters (C2 to C4), but were able to convert long-chain (/H11022C10) substrates as well. Their
temperature optimums were 55°C and 70°C for PET6 and PET2, respectively. Remark-
ably, PET2 retained 80% of its relative activity at 90°C after incubation for/H110225 h. Both
enzymes preferred alkaline pH values of 8 to 9. Rubidium at a concentration of 1
mmol/liter had a strong effect in the case of PET2 by increasing the activity by 50%. A
similar but signiﬁcantly smaller effect was observed in the case of PET6. Both enzymes

showed reduced hydrolytic activity in the presence of 5% SDS, 10 mM phenylmethyl-
sulfonyl ﬂuoride (PMSF), and 30% acetonitrile. Additional high-performance liquid
chromatography (HPLC) analyses conﬁrmed the above ﬁndings for PET2. In tests using
14 mg of amorphous PET foil as the substrate, 100
/H9262g of PET 2 was able to release 900
/H9262M terephthalic acid after 24 h of incubation (see Fig. S4 in the supplemental material).
Altogether, the data presented above indicate that the developed search algorithm
is useful for the identiﬁcation of novel and functionally active PET hydrolases from
single genomes and metagenomes.
Global distribution of PET hydrolases and their signiﬁcance in marine and
terrestrial environments.After the successful construction of a reliable HMM and the
identiﬁcation, as well as partial characterization, of new PET hydrolases, we asked if
these enzymes could be identiﬁed on a global level, and if so, to what extent. To
evaluate the environmental distribution of sequences encoding PET hydrolases, the
data from 108 marine and 25 terrestrial metagenomes were taken into account and
downloaded from the IMG database (
27) (see Table S2 in the supplemental material).
Criteria for the selection of marine data included sample depth (maximum 2 m),
assembly status, global distribution of sample locations, and size and availability of the
data set. The same criteria, except for the sample depth, were chosen for terrestrial
metagenomes. The size of the assembled metagenome data in the case of marine
metagenomes ranged from 10.85 Mb up to 7.99 Gb. In the case of terrestrial meta-
genomes, the number of assembled bases ranged from 58 Mb to 9.2 Gb. The modiﬁed
HMM was used to ﬁnd PET hydrolase homologs in the sequence data of those
metagenomes on a global scale. The searches identiﬁed possible PET hydrolase ho-
mologs in 31 marine and 11 terrestrial metagenomes. A total of 349 hits was observed
for these 42 samples. The number of hits per sample was normalized, calculated as hits
per Mb, and visualized on a global map representing the geographical location as well

as the frequency of PET hydrolase homologs (Fig. 6). Within the marine and terrestrial
metagenomes, PET hydrolase frequencies ranged from 0.004 to 0.92 hits/Mb and
0.0001 to 1.513 hits/Mb, respectively.
The combined genome sizes of terrestrial metagenomes are nearly 2.5-fold higher
than those of the marine metagenomes, and they harbor 157 PET hydrolase homologs
in average. In contrast, the marine metagenomes harbor an average of 42 PET hydro-
lases. The terrestrial metagenome with the highest abundance of potential PET hydro-
lases contains 135 sequence hits and was derived from the sediment core of a heavy
oil reservoir in Canada (IMG genome number 3300001197). In the case of the marine
metagenomes, the maximum was 31 hits, found within the metagenome data of a
sample from the Delaware coast in the United States (
Fig. 6).
We further observed that within the terrestrial habitats, theActinobacteria were the
main hosts for the terrestrial-derived enzymes. However, in the marine samples, most
predicted PET hydrolases originated from the phylum ofBacteroidetes (
Fig. 7). Bacte-
roidetes sequences in the marine samples were afﬁliated with 43% of all hits. The
phylum Proteobacteria was the second-most abundant in both data sets, with 23% of
hits in marine and 20% in terrestrial data (Fig. 7).
DISCUSSION
In this work, we developed a search algorithm that allows thein silicoidentiﬁcation
of PET hydrolase gene candidates from genomes and metagenomes. Altogether, we
were able to identify 504 novel possible enzyme candidates in the UniProtKB and
nonredundant RefSeq databases and the metagenomic database available in the NCBI

database. In addition, we identiﬁed 349 candidate genes and enzymes from marine
and terrestrial metagenomes available at the IMG platform. This is by far the largest
collection of PET hydrolase enzyme candidates currently available. A ﬁrst classiﬁcation
of the PET hydrolases derived from UniProtKB/GenBank due to their protein sequence
similarities and occurrence of conserved homologs enabled the formation of 17 en-
zyme clusters in this work (
Fig. 4). An additional search of global metagenomes
revealedthatthePEThydrolasesoccurinbothmarineandterrestrialhabitats.However,
the frequencies (hits per Mb) are comparably low. The lowest hit rate was observed for
ametagenomefromaKansas(UnitedStates)prairiesoilsampleandthehighesthitrate
was observed for a metagenome derived from a heavy oil reservoir sediment core.
Since we included over 100 metagenomes in this analysis, the data give a reliable
pictureoftheoveralloccurrenceoftheseenzymes,butdonotallowestimationsonthe
expression of these genes in the native environment. However, the overall low gene
frequencies might suggest that bacterial evolution has not yet allowed the spreading
of this trait. This also implies that the overall degradation potential of the oceans is
rather low compared to that of other habitats and enzymes involved in the breakdown
of natural polymers like starch or cellulose (
28, 29).
We veriﬁed the usefulness of the developed algorithm by cloning four novel PET
hydrolase genes and expressing them heterologously inE. coli. All enzyme clones were
active and supported the notion that the developed search algorithm is useful. The
enzyme properties of the newly characterized PET hydrolases ﬁt well into the overall
picture of known PET hydrolyzing enzymes, with an optimum pH at slightly alkaline
values and a preference for substrates with a short chain length (
14)( 30). Overall, these

novelenzymesrevealedcomparableactivitiestothosealreadypreviouslycharacterized
(see Table 1and references therein).
To our surprise, both enzymes characterized in more detail (PET2 and PET6) showed
traits of thermostability (Fig. 5)( 25). PET2 was stable up to 90°C, with measurable
residual activity of more than 50%. This is more stable than the LCC derived from a
compost metagenome (
14).
All of the newly identiﬁed PET hydrolases originated mainly from three bacterial
phyla, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. Within this framework, it is
notable that theBacteroidetes have so far not been associated with PET degradation,
but Bacteroidetes species have been described as very potent degraders of other
polymers, and they harbor a multitude of hydrolases and binding modules (31–33).
The restriction of PET hydrolases to a few bacterial phyla could indicate that this
metabolic capability has only rather recently been evolved and is thus limited to a very
few phylogenetic groups. The observation here that in the marine habitat the phylum
Bacteroidetes is the main host of PET hydrolases is new and intriguing for several
reasons. First, using classical searches and biochemical characterization, theActinobac-
teria andProteobacteria were considered to be the main hosts for these enzymes (
Table
1). Second, the searches in UNIProtKB and other databases implemented on the NCBI
website underlined the presence of PET hydrolases in the phylaActinobacteria and
Proteobacteria. Only when we extended our search for metagenomes of mainly non-
cultivated bacterial phyla did we identify theBacteroidetes as the main hosts for these
enzymes in the marine environment.
The recent ﬁndings on PET hydrolases described in this publication will signiﬁcantly
extend the knowledge of these enzymes and provide promising candidates for bio-
technological applications. In summary, the over 800 enzyme candidates identiﬁed in
this work will build the basis for a global repository and database of this urgently
needed enzyme class.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains, plasmids, and primers.Bacterial strains, plasmids, and primers used in this study
are listed inTables 3and4. If not otherwise mentioned,Escherichia coliclones were grown in LB medium
(1% tryptone/peptone, 0.5% yeast extract, and 1% NaCl) supplemented with appropriate antibiotics (25
/H9262g/ml kanamycin or 100/H9262g/ml ampicillin) at 37°C for 18 h.
Databases used in this study and bioinformatic analysis.Nucleotide and amino acid sequences
of putative PET hydrolases were acquired from databases integrated into the NCBI (https://www.ncbi
.nlm.nih.gov/), UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org/) and the Joint Genome Institute (JGI) IMG (https://img
.jgi.doe.gov/) websites (34), (27, 35). Sequences were compared to others deposited in the NCBI
databasesusingBLASTalignmenttools( 36).AminoacidsequenceHMMsearchwascarriedoutusingthe
HMMER (http://hmmer.org/) webpage or a local version of the software (v3.1b2) with downloaded data
sets. Structural information on the enzymes was retrieved from the RCSB-PDB (37) database.
Sequence data were processed using BioEdit and the Clone Manager suite version 9 (Sci-Ed Software,
Denver, USA). Neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees based on amino acid sequence alignments were
constructed using MEGA6 (
38). Nine known and activity-conﬁrmed bacterial PET hydrolase sequences
were obtained from NCBI, aligned with T-Coffee (39) and manually revised. Afterwards, the alignment
was used to construct a proﬁle HMM with the “hmmbuild” function of the HMMER package (http://
hmmer.org/). After the identiﬁcation of PET hydrolase homologs, the obtained sequences were included
in the above-mentioned alignment and the HMM was reﬁned. An HMM logo was visualized using the
Skylign online tool (
40). Metagenomic data were downloaded from the IMG database using a Globus
endpoint and were further analyzed using “hmmsearch” from the HMMER package. Phylogenetic
assignment was done via a local diamond-blast search (
41) against the nonredundant protein database
(36) and subsequent analysis with MEGAN6 (42). The map representing the frequency and geographical
distribution of PET hydrolases in metagenomes (Fig. 6) was constructed using qGIS Desktop 2.18.5
(http://www.qgis.org/).
Cloning and heterologous expression of PET2, PET5, PET6, and PET12 in Escherichia coli
T7-SHufﬂe. Cloning of PET hydrolase genes into the expression vectors pET21a(/H11001) and pET28a(/H11001) was
accomplished after ampliﬁcation of genomic DNA using speciﬁc primer pairs with underlined homolog
regions to the vector or restriction sites. The sequence of PET2 was obtained from NCBI (GenBank
accession number
ACC95208) and synthesized after codon usage optimization forE. coli(MWG Euroﬁns,
Germany). Obtained DNAs were cloned into expression vectors, and the constructs were transformed
into E. coli T7-SHufﬂe cells. The cultures were grown aerobically in autoinduction medium (ZYM-5052)
(
43) containing 100/H9262g/ml ampicillin and 25/H9262g/ml kanamycin for pET21a(/H11001) and pET28a(/H11001), respec-
tively, at 37°C until they reached an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 1.0. The proteins harboring a
C- or N-terminal histidine tag were expressed afterwards at 17°C for 16 to 20 h. The cells were harvested

and lysed with pressure using a French press. Afterwards, the proteins were puriﬁed with nickel-ion
afﬁnity chromatography using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and
analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The elution buffer was exchanged against 0.1 mM potassium phosphate buffer
pH 8.0 in a 10 kDa Amicon tube (GE Health Care, Solingen, Germany).
Biochemical characterization of PET2 and PET6.For activity tests, both enzymes were assayed
using puriﬁed recombinant protein. Unless otherwise indicated, the enzymes were added to a substrate
solution containing 190
/H9262l of either 0.2 M sodium phosphate buffer or 0.1 M Tris-HCl, with a deﬁned pH
between 7 and 8 and 0.5 mMpNP substrate dissolved in isopropanol. Incubation time ranged from 15
to 30 min. As substrates, we testedpNP esters with chain lengths of C2,C 4,C 6,C 8,C 10,C 12,C 14,C 16, and
C18. After incubation at a deﬁned temperature, the color change from colorless to yellow was measured
at 405 nm in a plate reader (Biotek, Winooski, USA). All samples were measured in triplicate. For
determination of the optimal temperature, samples were incubated between 17°C and 90°C for 15 min.
The impact of pH conditions on the activity of each enzyme was measured in citrate phosphate (pH 3.0,
4.0, and 5.0), potassium phosphate (pH 6.0, 7.0, and 8.0), and carbonate bicarbonate buffer (pH 9.2 and
10.2). The inﬂuence of possible cofactors, solvents, detergents, and inhibitors was assayed at different
concentration levels. After1ho f incubation in the presence of the substances described below, the
residualactivitywasdeterminedafter15minincubationatoptimaltemperaturewith pNP-octanoateand

2/H11001,C o2/H11001,C u2/H11001,F e3/H11001,M g2/H11001,M n2/H11001,R b2/H11001, and Zn2/H11001, with ﬁnal
concentrations of 1 and 10 mM, were used. To determine the solvent stability, dimethyl sulfoxide
(DMSO), isopropanol, methanol, dimethylformamide (DMF), acetone, acetonitrile, and ethanol, with ﬁnal
concentrations of 10% and 30% (vol/vol) were added to the reaction. Detergent stability was assayed
with SDS, Triton X-100, and Tween 80 at 1% and 5% (wt/vol, vol/vol) concentration. The inhibitory effects
of EDTA, dithiothreitol (DTT), and PMSF were tested at 1 and 10 mM concentration. Substrate analyses
using the HPLC LaChrom Elite system from Hitachi (Tokyo, Japan) with a Lichrospher 100 RP-18e column
(VWR International GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany), consisting of 5-
/H9262m diameter particles, were done as
previouslypublished( 14).A14-mglow-crystallinityPETﬁlm(GoodfellowGmbH,BadNauheim,Germany)
was used as the substrate. For enzymatic hydrolysis, up to 50/H9262g of protein was incubated at 60°C with
continuous shaking at 500 rpm. As a mobile phase, acetonitrile (A) and water with 0.1% triﬂuoroacetic
acid (TFA) (B) were used in a isocratic method with 20% acetonitrile (A). The reaction buffer was 0.1 M
Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), with an injection volume of 99
/H9262l. Detection was performed at 241 nm.
