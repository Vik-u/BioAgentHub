Abstract 
Using enzymes to hydrolyze and recycle poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is an attractive eco‑friendly approach to 
manage the ever‑increasing PET wastes, while one major challenge to realize the commercial application of enzyme‑
based PET degradation is to establish large‑scale production methods to produce PET hydrolytic enzyme. To achieve 
this goal, we exploited the industrial strain Pichia pastoris to express a PET hydrolytic enzyme from Caldimonas 
taiwanensis termed CtPL‑DM. In contrast to the protein expressed in Escherichia coli, CtPL‑DM expressed in P . pastoris 
is inactive in PET degradation. Structural analysis indicates that a putative N‑glycosylation site N181 could restrain the 
conformational change of a substrate‑binding Trp and hamper the enzyme action. We thus constructed N181A to 
remove the N‑glycosylation and found that the PET hydrolytic activity of this variant was restored. The performance 
of N181A was further enhanced via molecular engineering. These results are of valuable in terms of PET hydrolytic 
enzyme production in industrial strains in the future.

Graphical Abstract
Introduction
The accumulation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) 
wastes has become a severe burden to the global envi -
ronment and ecosystem (Lear et al. 2021). Enzyme-based 
degradation of PET is an eco-friendly recycling strategy 
compared with other waste management methods such 
as chemical and mechanical processes. In recent years, 
many microbial strains and enzymes that can degrade 
PET have been discovered. However, these machiner -
ies often exhibit poor activity, such that numerous engi -
neering efforts have been paid to improve their efficacy 
(Urbanek et al. 2021; Zhu et al. 2022; Kawai 2021). Fur -
thermore, PET monomeric constituent terephthalic acid 
(TPA) yielded by the engineered PET degrading enzymes 
can be recovered and used for the re-synthesis of PET, 
suggesting that the bio-based PET recycling process can 
be practiced in principle (Tournier et  al. 2020; Lu et  al. 
2022; Dissanayake and Jayakody 2021).
A number of enzymes that exhibit PET degradation 
activity have been reported, which mainly are ester bond 
hydrolytic enzymes including cutinases, lipases, and 
esterases (Kawai et  al. 2019; Gao et  al. 2021). In 2016, 
Yoshida et  al. isolated a PET assimilating bacterium 
Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6 from a PET recycling site, 
which exploits a dual-enzyme system (Is PETase and IsM-
HETase) to breakdown PET into TPA and ethylene glycol 
(EG) (Yoshida et al. 2016). IsPETase is the first naturally 
evolved PET hydrolytic enzyme, which shares a high 
sequence identity to cutinases and shows superior PET 
degradation activity at a moderate temperature in com -
parison with other PET degrading enzymes. The crystal 
structure of Is PETase was soon after reported by several 
groups, which revealed unique features of the enzyme 
in having a flexible substrate-binding pocket conferred 
by the wobbling TPA-interacting residue W185 (Austin 
et al. 2018; Chen et al. 2018; Fecker et al. 2018; Joo et al. 
2018; Liu et al. 2019a). Recently, we found that the W185 
wobbling is resulted from the presence of two Is PETase-
unique amino acids (S214 and I218) that are located 
under W185, whose equivalents are His and Phe in all 
homologous enzymes (Chen et  al. 2021). Substituting 
His/Phe with Ser/Ile should expand the substrate-binding 
pocket to accommodate the bulkier substrate PET, and 
the strategy termed “double mutation (DM)” has proven 
to be useful to enhance PET hydrolytic activity of several 
IsPETase-like enzymes.
High-level production and good performance char -
acteristics of PET degrading enzymes are required to 
facilitate the industrial applications of these enzymes. 
Several expression systems have been reported for 
heterologous expression of PET degrading enzymes. 
Escherichia coli intracellular expression is one of the 
most commonly used technique in laboratory due to 
low cost and ease of manipulation, but further appli -
cations with this system are hampered by additional 
protein purification processes. Secreted expression in 
E. coli involving signal peptide optimization and chap -
eron co-expression was thus exploited for Is PETase 
production, but the bacterial endotoxin remains a 
potential threat (Seo et  al. 2019; Shi et  al. 2021; Aer 
et  al. 2022). Other prokaryotic cell factories such as 
Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas putida have been 
utilized to scale up PET hydrolase production (Xi et al. 
2021; Wang et  al. 2020; Oh et  al. 2022; Huang et  al. 
2018). Microalgae are also attractive hosts because of 
its rich resources and wide utilizations in many areas 
and commercial applications. A diatom Phaeodacty -
lum tricornutum and green algae, Chlamydomonas

reinhardtii were also employed to functionally express 
IsPETase, suggesting that it may be a potential indus -
trial application strategy of PET degradation (Kim 
et al. 2020).
Pichia pastoris is among the most widely applied 
industrial strains for enzyme production, which 
is advantageous in easy gene manipulation, secre -
tory expression, low production cost, and fast growth 
speed. Complex post-translational modifications 
can be achieved in P. pastoris, therefore large quan -
tities of recombinant protein with correct folding, 
disulfide bond formation as well as glycosylation, 
can be obtained (Yang and Zhang 2018). Moreover, 
large amounts of cells can be easily grown in minimal 
medium through fed-batch high-cell-density fermenta -
tion methodology (Liu et al. 2019b). With this expres -
sion system, a highly pure demanded protein can be 
produced without further purification procedures 
owing to the low basal level endogenous secretory pro -
teins (Karbalaei et al. 2020). We have also demonstrated 
that P. pastoris can be used to express IsPETase and a 
IsPETase-like enzyme termed Bur PL, which exhibit 
better thermostability than those expressed in E. coli  
(Chen et al. 2021; Shirke et al. 2018).
Notable, the expression and function of prokaryotic 
proteins might be compromised to various extents 
when expressed in the eukaryotic system. This can be 
overcome by optimization processes, including codon 
optimization, promoter strengthening, chaperone co-
expression, and protein engineering (Juturu and Wu 
2018; Jariyachawalid et al. 2012). As shown in our pre -
vious study, the N-linked glycosylation of the P. p a s -
toris-expressed IsPETase and Bur PL appear to pose 
negative effects on their PET hydrolytic activity and 
de-glycosylation treatment can significantly elevate the 
enzyme activity (Chen et  al. 2021). This phenomenon 
has also been reported elsewhere that N -glycosylations 
in eukaryotic expression systems could interfere the 
bio-activity of prokaryotic genes, and de-glycosylation 
or mutagenesis can be applied to restore the protein 
function (Tarahomjoo et  al. 2008; Huang et  al. 2013; 
Han et al. 2020).
Here, we report our experience in establishing the P. 
pastoris strain that expresses a PET hydrolytic enzyme 
from Caldimonas taiwanensis termed CtPL-DM that 
was identified from sequence mining from GenBank 
and modified by the DM strategy. This enzyme exhibits 
optimal activity at 60  ℃ and shows application poten -
tials in PET biodegradation. The process to enhance 
protein expression and activity of CtPL-DM in P. pasto -
ris will be demonstrated, which should be of great value 
to guide further industrial applications of PET hydro -
lytic enzymes.
Material and methods
Plasmid construction and mutagenesis
Plasmid that carries the coding gene of CtPL-DM has 
been described previously (Chen et  al. 2021). The tar -
get gene was cloned to pET32a and pPICZαA vec -
tors for enzyme expression in E. coli and P. pastoris,  
respectively.
The variants were generated through PCR-based 
site-directed mutagenesis with the pPICZαA carry -
ing wild-type CtPL-DM as a template. The sequences 
of the mutagenesis oligonucleotides are listed in Addi -
tional file  1: Table  S1. The PCR reaction consisting of 
2 × Phanta Flash Master Mix (12.5 μL), 0.5 μL forward 
primer, 0.5 μL reverse primer, 0.5 μL template DNA, 
11 μL double distilled water was subjected to amplifi -
cation with the following program: 95 °C for 3 min, 25 
cycles (95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min), 
followed by the final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The 
PCR products were digested with DpnI to remove the 
template DNA, and then transformed into E. coli DH5α 
cells with selection for resistance to ampicillin (100 mg 
 L−1). All constructed plasmids were validated by direct 
DNA sequencing, and the mutants were expressed in 
P. pastoris and purified as CtPL-DM, the crystalliza -
tion and enzyme activity measurement were conducted 
according to the methods described in the following 
paragraphs.
Recombinant protein expression and purification in E. coli
The pET32a plasmid carrying CtPL-DM was trans -
formed into E. coli BL21  (DE3) and grown in Luria–
Bertani medium containing 100  mg  L−1 ampicillin at 
37 °C. When OD600 reached ~ 0.8, the protein expres -
sion was induced with 0.3 mM IPTG at 16 °C for 18 h. 
The cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6000 × g 
for 10 min and then resuspended in buffer A that con -
tains 25  mM Tris–HCl, 150  mM NaCl and 20  mM 
imidazole (pH 7.5). Cells were then disrupted with a 
French press, and cell debris was removed by centrifu -
gation at 27,000 × g and 4  °C for 1  h. The supernatant 
was then applied to a buffer A-equilibrated Ni–NTA 
column and eluted against a linear gradient of 0 to 60% 
buffer B (25 mM Tris–HCl, 150 mM NaCl and 500 mM 
imidazole, pH 7.5) at a flow rate of 4  mL   min−1. The 
target protein-containing fractions were collected and 
dialyzed against buffer C (25  mM Tris–HCl, 150  mM 
NaCl, pH 7.5) which contains tobacco etch virus (TEV) 
protease to remove the thioredoxin and His-tag. The 
protein-containing solution was then passed through a 
second Ni–NTA column and the untagged target pro -
tein in flow-through was collected, concentrated and 
stored at -80 °C before further analyses.

Recombinant protein expression and purification in P.  
pastoris
The protein expression and purification processes of 
CtPL-DM and variants follow the same procedures. The 
PmeI-linearized recombinant pPICZαA plasmids were 
transformed into P. pastoris X33 by electroporation. 
Transformants that carry the target gene were selected on 
YPD plates (1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 2% dextrose, 
2% agar) containing 250 μg   mL−1 zeocin. Single colonies 
were inoculated in 5 mL YPD and cultured at 30 °C for 
24 h prior to induction by BMMY (1% yeast extract, 2% 
peptone, 100  mM potassium phosphate (pH 6.0), 1.34% 
yeast nitrogen base with ammonium, 4 ×  10–5% bio -
tin and 0.5% methanol) and at 30  °C for 48  h. The pro -
tein expression in culture supernatant was examined by 
SDS-PAGE and the highest clones were chosen for fur -
ther experiments. The cells were inoculated into 10 mL of 
YPD at 30 °C for 24 h and transferred to 500 mL BMGY 
(1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, 100 mM potassium phos -
phate (pH 6.0), 1.34% yeast nitrogen base with ammo -
nium, 4 ×  10–5% biotin and 1% glycerol) for another 24 h. 
Then the culture medium was replaced with 500  mL 
BMMY medium and 1% methanol was supplemented 
every 24 h to induce protein expression for five days. The 
supernatant was collected and concentrated by ~ tenfold 
using an ultrafiltration unit with a 10-kDa cutoff mem -
brane (Sartorius Stedim Biotech) and then dialyzed 
against a buffer containing 25  mM HEPES (pH 7.0) at 
4 °C for 24 h. Owing to lack of His-tag, supernatants were 
purified by employing ion exchange chromatography. 
Target protein-containing solution was applied onto an 
SP Sepharose column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with a 
NaCl gradient of 0–1 M at a flow rate of 4 mL  min−1. The 
protein-containing fractions were collected, concentrated 
and stored at -80 °C before further analyses.
Crystallization and structure determination
Crystallization trials were conducted with commercial 
crystallization kit via the method of sitting drop vapor-
diffusion at 25 °C. The ratio of protein solution and res -
ervoir solution is 1:1. The mixture in 96-well Cryschem 
plates and equilibrated against 100 μL reservoir solution. 
The optimal crystallization condition of each protein was 
as follows: CtPL-DM, 0.1 M potassium bromide, 33% w/v 
PEG 2000 MME; CtPL-DM-S155A, 20% PEG 2000 MME, 
0.2  M ammonium citrate tribasic (pH 7.0), 0.1  M imi -
dazole; CtPL-DM-N181A-F235L-S155A, 0.8  M lithium 
chloride, 5% PEG 6000, 0.1  M citric acid (pH 4.0). The 
X-ray diffraction datasets were collected using a Bruker 
D8 Venture coupled with a CMOS-PHOTON II detector 
at Hubei University and processed by Proteum 3 (Bruker 
AXS GmbH). The structures of CtPL-DM was first solved 
by molecular replacement method using the program 
PHASER in the CCP4i suite (Potterton et al. 2003) with 
a template built from Is PETase as a searching model. 
Subsequent model refinement was conducted with Coot 
(Emsley and Cowtan 2004) and Refmac5 (Murshudov 
et al. 1997). Prior to structure refinement, 5% randomly 
selected reflections were set aside for calculating Rfree as a 
monitor of model quality. The refined structure of CtPL-
DM was used as a template to solve the other CtPL-DM 
structures.
PET degrading activity measurement
The PET hydrolytic activity of CtPL-DM and variants 
was measured by the same procedures that was described 
previously with some modifications (Chen et  al. 2021). 
1-mL reaction mixtures containing 3  mg ground PET 
powder (Sigma-Aldrich, cat. no. 429252) or a piece 
of Goodfellow amorphous PET film (GfPET, 6  mm in 
diameter, ~ 8 mg, crystallinity of 7.3%), 10 μg   mL−1 puri-
fied enzyme and 50 mM glycine–NaOH buffer (pH 9.0) 
were incubated at indicated temperatures with agitation 
at 800 rpm for various period of times. The reaction was 
terminated by heating at 85 °C for 10 min. The mixtures 
were then passed through a 0.22-μm filter and then ana -
lyzed by HPLC analytic system coupled with a C18 col -
umn. The mobile phase consists of 20  mM phosphate 
buffer (pH 2.5) and a methanol gradient from 35 to 70% 
in 0–25 min at a flow rate of 1 mL   min−1 was used. The 
hydrolytic products MHET and TPA were recorded by 
monitoring the absorbance at 240 nm and their amounts 
were calculated based on standard curves generated from 
a series of MHET and TPA with known concentrations.
Results and discussion
Secretion expression of CtPL‑DM in P . pastoris
Our previous report indicated that CtPL-DM exhib -
its potent PET hydrolytic activity that about sevenfold 
more hydrolytic products were obtained from hydrolyz -
ing GfPET in comparison with Is PETase (Fig.  1a). We 
then aimed to explore the industrial application poten -
tials of CtPL-DM by employing P. pastoris as the protein 
expression vehicle. Unfortunately, our initial attempt to 
express CtPL-DM in P. pastoris was not successful that 
extremely low, if any, protein expression was detected 
(data not shown). This is in stark contrast to our expe -
riences with Is PETase and Bur PL (Chen et  al. 2021). 
Through inspecting the sequences of Is PETase and 
CtPL-DM in the recombinant pPICZαA plasmids, we 
noticed that the amino acids in the conjugation region 
between the secretion signal and the mature sequence 
of two constructs are different (Fig.  1b). We suspected 
that the inefficient cleavage of the secretion signal might 
lead to low protein expression in the original CtPL-DM 
construct and thus altered the N-terminal amino acids

Li et al. Bioresources and Bioprocessing           (2023) 10:26 
 
of the CtPL-DM-expressing sequence to mimic those 
in IsPETase (Fig.  1b). As a result, transformation of the 
modified CtPL-DM construct led to successful expres -
sion of the recombinant protein in P. pastoris (see below).
Restoration of PET hydrolytic activity of P.  
pastoris‑expressed CtPL‑DM
Although the recombinant protein of CtPL-DM was suc -
cessfully expressed in P. pastoris, we surprisingly found 
that the protein exhibited no detectable PET hydro -
lytic activity (Fig.  2a, b and Additional file  1: Fig. S1a). 
One major discrepancy between E. coli- and P. pasto -
ris-expressed protein is the latter contains high degree 
N-glycosylations (Fig.  2a). In our previous report, de-
glycosylation treatment with EndoH can significantly 
enhance the PET hydrolytic activity of P. pastoris-
expressed IsPETase and Bur PL-DM (Chen et  al. 2021). 
We then treated P. pastoris-expressed CtPL-DM with 
EndoH and still did not detect PET hydrolytic prod -
ucts (Fig.  2b and Additional file  1: Fig. S1a). We thus 
proceeded to solve the crystal structure of P. pastoris-
expressed CtPL-DM to explore the possible reason 
underlying the loss of activity. We obtained the apo-form 
crystal structures of wild type and inactive variant S155A 
of CtPL-DM (Table  1), which adopt the canonical α/β-
hydrolase fold and are highly identical to the structure 
of IsPETase (Cα RMSD 0.477 Å and 0.471 Å) (Additional 
file 1: Fig. S2). The catalytic triad was found in an open 
cleft formed on the protein surface (Fig.  2c). The TPA-
binding W180 adopts the C-type conformation in the 
CtPL-DM structure and an alternative type in CtPL-DM-
S155A (Additional file  1: Fig. S2). This suggests that DM 
strategy has conferred the TPA-binding Trp in CtPL-DM 
a wobble conformation.
In both structures, a sugar that is covalently linked to 
N220 was observed (Fig. 2c and Additional file 1: Fig. S3). 
Protein sequence analysis indicates that there are three 
putative N-glycosylation sites in addition to N220 includ-
ing N168, N181 and N261 (Additional file  1: Fig. S4). As 
revealed by the crystal structures, the side chain of N168 
is surrounded by several neighboring residues and might 
be inaccessible to the glycosylation machinery (Fig.  2d). 
N181 and N261 face towards the bulk solvent and could 
be glycosylated, despite no additional electron density 
map attached to these residues was observed (Fig.  2d). 
Notably, N181 is located adjacent to the TPA-binding 
residue W180 (Fig. 2d), and its glycosylation, if any, could 
likely impose spatial hindrance to prevent W180 from 
wobbling and impact the substrate binding. Although 
EndoH is capable of hydrolyzing glycosidic bonds to 
remove most of the glycosylations on protein surfaces, 
at least one residual sugar that is covalently attached to 
the Asn residue is retained. We wonder whether the gly -
cosylated N181 would influence CtPL-DM activity, thus 
constructed variant N181A and had its activity meas -
ured. SDS-PAGE analysis clearly indicated that N181 is 
glycosylated as the variant N181A showed lower degree 
of glycosylation than the parental enzyme (Fig.  2a). Fur-
thermore, the P. pastoris-expressed N181A exhibits PET 
hydrolyzing activity that is comparable to that of E. coli-
expressed protein (Fig. 2b and Additional file 1: Fig. S1b). 
Notably, de-glycosylation did not further elevate N181A 
performance, suggesting that the other N-glycosylation 
sites might play minimal roles in CtPL-DM-catalyzed

PET degradation. Indeed, depletion of all three putative 
N-glycosylations sites (3A, N181A/N220A/N261A) did 
not further benefit the enzyme reactivity (Fig. 2b).
Engineering the N181A variant
We next set to enhance the performance of N181A 
through conducting molecular engineering (Fig.  3a). 
First, we compared the protein sequence of N181A and 
the thermostable variant of Is PETase (IsPETaseEHA) (Son 
et al. 2019) and introduces three equivalent mutations to 
construct an EHA variant. Second, we modified a flex -
ible loop that contain three consecutive Gly residues and 
is close to the active site by replacing each Gly with Pro 
in an attempt to enhance protein stability (G240P , G241P 
and G242P). This loop was also engineered by introduc -
ing triple mutation G241N/G242S/H243N (termed NSN) 
to mimic Is PETase. Next, the strategy utilized to gener -
ate a recently reported variant of a leaf compost cutinase 
designated LCC-ICCG that exhibits superior PET hydro -
lytic activity was also applied. The enhanced PET hydro -
lytic activity of LCC-ICCG was attributed to the F243I 
modification (Tournier et al. 2020), and the I243 should 
expand the substrate-binding tunnel to boost the enzyme 
activity based on our recent report (Zeng et  al. 2022). 
N181A also has Phe in the F243 corresponding residue 
235, thus the variants F235L and F235I were constructed. 
In addition, F235 was altered to Ser in accordance with 
IsPETase sequence. The feature that grants LCC-ICCG

higher performance at elevated temperatures is an addi -
tional pair of disulfide bond, which has also been imple -
mented in a recently reported thermostable variant of 
IsPETase designated as HotPETase (Bell et  al. 2022). 
Therefore, a N181A variant termed CC that carries 
R230C/S284C double mutation to introduce an equiva -
lent disulfide bond was also generated. PET hydrolytic 
activity measurement indicates that F235L and CC are 
the most promising variants, whose activity was elevated 
by more than 60% and ~ 20% activity at 60  ºC, respec -
tively (Fig.  3b). Notably, CC displays better performance 
at a higher temperature, such that more than 2.5-fold 
higher activity in comparison with the parental enzyme 
was detected at 70 °C (Fig.  3b). We also combined these 
two variants but did not obtain better results. Therefore, 
the following analyses will be focused on variant F235L.
Structural investigation of F235L
The crystal structure of the inactive variant of F235L, 
termed F235L-S155A, was successfully solved, which 
shares a highly identical overall fold to those of CtPL-
DM and CtPL-DM-S155A. Since the attempt to obtained 
substrate/analogue-bound complex failed, the MHET in 
IsPETase/MHET complex structure was modeled into 
these apo-form structures to investigate their substrate-
binding modes. Compared with two DM structures, the 
cavity in the rear of the MHET in F235L-S155A is slightly 
expanded (Fig.  4a), which might create a broader sub -
strate-binding tunnel to facilitate the binding of PET. This 
is similar to that was observed in the complex structure of 
LCC-ICCG (Zeng et al. 2022) and should be considered 
as a factor to render the higher activity. In addition to the 
substrate-binding tunnel, the structure of F235L-S155A 
also provides an opportunity to visualize the N181A-
mediated effects. In all three structures, the TPA-binding 
W180 adopts conformations that should collide with the 
MHET (Fig.  4b). Nonetheless, W180 in F235L-S155A, 
which carries N181A mutation, shall be able to wobble 
freely. On the other hand, the conformational change of 
W180 in CtPL-DM and CtPL-DM-S155A is restrained by 
the glycosylated N181 (Fig. 4b), thus impedes the binding 
of PET.
CtPL variants‑mediated PET hydrolysis in a prolong time
We next examined the PET hydrolytic activity of the most 
potent variant of CtPL-DM in a prolonged reaction dura-
tion. As shown in Fig.  5a, N181A and F235L can catalyze 
hydrolysis of amorphous GfPET film and the hydrolytic 
products increased with time, with F235L higher than 
the parental N181A. Notably, the amounts of hydrolytic 
products released by N181A and F235L that operated at 
60 °C reached plateaus within 3 days, while those at 50 °C 
reactions gradually elevated and surpassed 60 °C-treated 
samples in 6 days. This indicates that the optimal tem -
perature of enzyme should be determined dependent on 
the reaction duration, a phenomenon similar to the pre -
viously reported results (Bell et al. 2022). The hydrolytic 
activities of CtPL-DM variants towards a reinforced PET 
which contains 30% glass fiber and is more resistant to 
the enzyme reaction were also examined. This substrate 
can be decomposed by N181A and F235L though lower 
amounts of hydrolytic products were detected compar -
ing to GfPET (Fig.  5). Similarly, F235L exhibited higher 
activity than N181A and more hydrolytic products can 
be detected in 50 °C-treated samples than those of 60 °C.
Conclusion
In this study, we demonstrated how to achieve secre -
tory expression of CtPL-DM in an industrial strain P. 
pastoris, a cutinase-like enzyme that was modified to 
exhibit PET hydrolytic activity. More importantly, the 
glycosylation modification on a residue that is located 
adjacent to the substrate-binding site could devastate

the enzyme performance, and applying molecular engi -
neering to remove the glycosylation site, instead of just 
treating the protein with de-glycosylation enzyme, is 
required to restore the enzyme activity. The subsequent 
rational design in an attempt to enhance the CtPL-DM 
performance was conducted, which afforded a vari -
ant that harbors an expanded substrate-binding tun -
nel and exhibits higher activity. We also consider that 
the variant F235L should be a good start for further 
modifications and are now working on improving its 
thermostability via molecular engineering. Altogether, 
critical issues and feasible solutions in producing PET 
hydrolytic enzymes in P. pastoris are revealed in this 
study, and these results might be applied in other pro -
tein expression vehicles that harbor post-translational 
modifications. This information provides an important 
guidance for the development of commercial applica -
tions of biological PET recycling technologies.
