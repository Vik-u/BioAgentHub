PET hydrolase (PETase), which hydrolyzes polyethylene terephthalate (PET) into soluble
building blocks, provides an attractive avenue for the bioconversion of plastics. Here we
present the structures of a novel PETase from the PET-consuming microbeIdeonella sakaiensis
in complex with substrate and product analogs. Through structural analyses, mutagenesis,
and activity measurements, a substrate-binding mode is proposed, and several features
critical for catalysis are elucidated.

P
olyethylene terephthalate (PET) is high molecular weight
polymer composed of ester bond-linked terephthalate
(TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG)1. The durability and other
favorable physical properties made PET one of the most exten-
sively utilized plastic. However, the large amounts of PET that
enters and accumulates in the ecosystem pose a great environ-
mental challenge.
PET-hydrolyzing enzymes that decompose PET into its
building blocks could provide an eco-friendly solution to PET
accumulation in the environment
2. Hydrolases, including
esterases, lipases, and cutinases3– 7 have previously been reported
to exhibit PET-degrading activity. The catalytic mechanism of
cutinase, which belongs to the serine hydrolase family, has been
explored by analyzing complex structures of inhibitors8, 9 and
natural substrate analogs (cutin and triglyceride, Fig. 1)10– 12.
However, PET is very distinct from cutinase substrates in terms of
chemical structures, and the precise PET-binding mode and
underlying mechanism of PET hydrolysis remain unclear.
Recently, a novel bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6 was
isolated, which could utilize PET as an energy and carbon
source13. Speciﬁcally, I. sakaiensis adheres to PET surface and
secretes a unique cutinase-like enzyme that degrades PET. By
hydrolyzing PET, the enzyme produces mono-(2-hydroxyethyl)
terephthalic acid (MHET), TPA and bis-2(hydroxyethyl) TPA
(BHET) (Fig. 1). Notably, the enzyme is highly homologous to
several cutinases with PET-hydrolyzing activity but exhibits lower
activity on p-nitrophenol-linked aliphatic esters (Supplementary
Fig. 1), which are the preferred substrates for lipases and cuti-
nases. Instead, it exhibits 5.5- to 120-fold higher activity against
PET over the other enzymes. The enzyme is named PET
hydrolase (PETase) for its PET preference. PETase displays out-
standing performance in hydrolyzing PET and holds a great
potential in further applications. In this study, in order to
determine the mechanism of enzymatic PET hydrolysis, we have
determined the crystal structures of native PETase and two
ligand-bound complexes.
Results
Overall structures of PETase. The recombinant protein of wild-
type PETase without signal peptide was expressed and crystallized
in the orthorhombic space group P2
12121 (Supplementary
Table 2). The structure was solved at 1.58 Å resolution, and three
polypeptide chains were observed in an asymmetric unit, which
are denoted A, B, and C chain. PETase adopts the canonicalɑ/β-
hydrolase fold, in which the strictly conserved catalytic triad
S131-H208-D177, as predicted from sequence alignment with
homologous enzymes that exhibit PET-hydrolytic activity (Sup-
plementary Fig. 1), is found on the protein surface (Fig. 2a).
S131 serves as the nucleophile and is located within hydrogen-
bond distance to be polarized by the base H208, which is in turn
stabilized by the acid D177 (Fig.2b). Several unique features are

present near the catalytic center. First, PETase forms two intra-
molecular disulﬁde bridges (DS1 and DS2) while the other
homologous enzymes have only one (Supplementary Figs. 1
and 2). The strictly conserved DS2 (C244-C260) connects the
C-terminal helix and the last loop (Supplementary Fig.2), while
the PETase-speciﬁc DS1 (C174-C210) links two loops that harbor
the catalytic acid and base (Fig. 2b; Supplementary Fig. 1).
Second, W156 adjacent to the catalytic center displays variable
conformations in the crystal structures (Fig.2b). Interestingly, an
equivalent Trp is found in every PET-hydrolyzing enzyme, but
W156 wobbling has not been observed before (Fig.2c; Supple-
mentary Fig. 3). In fact, this Trp in the other structures all
adopted the “C” conformer (Fig. 2c; Supplementary Fig. 3).
Among the surrounding amino acids a distinct S185 is found in
PETase, which is consistently replaced by a His in the homo-
logous enzymes (Fig.2c; Supplementary Figs.1 and 3). Further
analyses indicate that a His side chain would be too close to allow
“A” or “B” conformer of W156 in PETase, while a Ser residue can
yield a space to accommodate the “C” conformer of W156
(Fig. 2c). Therefore, the W156 wobbling is due to the presence of
S185.
Complex structures of PETase. Next, we tried to obtain complex
structures by co-crystallizing or soaking the wild-type PETase
crystals with various ligands. However, no additional electron
density corresponding to ligand could be observed. We then used
the inactive variant protein S131A to prevent ligand hydrolysis.
Indeed, S131A variant showed very low activity comparing to the
wild-type protein (Fig.3c). However, attempts to obtain complex
structures using the S131A variant, which crystallized in a C2 unit
cell (Supplementary Table 2), also failed. In both crystal forms,
the R103 side chain of one protein molecule penetrates into a
surface cleft next to S131 (or A131) of another protein molecule
(Supplementary Fig. 4). It appeared likely that the R103 side
chain occupied the putative substrate-binding groove and pre-
vented the substrate from entering. The wild type and S131A
proteins also failed to crystallize in a different unit cell by
screening for many other crystallization conditions. We therefore
produced and crystallized the double mutant R103G/S131A
(DM) for complex formations. A comparison of the wild type,
S131A, and DM crystal structures suggests that these mutations
did not signiﬁcantly alter the overall protein fold (Cα root mean
square deviation= 0.144– 0.2 Å). Soaking the DM crystals with 1-
(2-hydroxyethyl) 4-methyl terephthalate (HEMT) and
p-nitrophenol (pNP) produced clear densities for both ligands,
and each compound could be modeled into a shallow cleft on the
protein surface (Supplementary Fig.5).
In DM-HEMT, the ligand is bound in a groove containing
A131, H208, W156, I179, W130, Y58, and M132 (Fig.3a). The
H208 side chain is within H-bond distance to the ester O atom of
HEMT, W156 that adopts the“B” conformer is T-stacked to the
benzene ring, and the other residues provide hydrophobic
interactions. The proximal carbonyl group lies adjacent to

A131, presumably facilitating nucleophilic attack by S131 in the
wild-type enzyme. The backbone NH groups of M132 and Y58
that constitute an oxyanion hole, a common feature of other
superfamily members including esterase and lipases 14, in the
catalytic center are within H-bonding distance to the carbonyl O
atom of HEMT (Fig.3a). Judged by its binding mode, the HEMT
in the complex behaves like a substrate analog. Therefore, a
fragment of PET that consists of two terephthalate molecules
linked by an ethylene glycol was docked into the enzyme based on
the DM-HEMT structure (Supplementary Fig. 6a). The two
phenyl groups are located on either side of A131 (or the catalytic
S131) with a kink of about 120°. In the binding region for the 1st
TPA unit, the same HEMT-interacting residues may bind to
PET (Supplementary Fig. 6b). In comparison, fewer residues
are found to contact the 2
nd TPA unit. Only T59 and W130
might provide H-bonding and T-stacking interactions with the
ester oxygen and the benzene ring (Supplementary Fig. 6b).
Sequence alignment and structure superimposition indicate that
the substrate-binding residues are strictly or semi-conserved
among the PET-hydrolyzing enzymes (Supplementary Figs. 1
and 7). Thus it appears that PETase and the other enzymes with
PET-hydrolyzing activity use a similar substrate-interaction
network.
The ligand of DM-pNP is located to the 1st benzene ring-
binding site, the same side as HEMT. Because the nitro group of
pNP is structurally similar to the carboxyl group of PETase
products (TPA and MHET, see Fig.1), the observed pNP binding
mode in the complex may be analogous to the product. Fewer
ligand interactions are found in DM-pNP than DM-HEMT that
involve only hydrophobic contacts with W156, I179, and M132
(Fig. 3b). Notably, the locations of HEMT and pNP vary slightly.
A comparison of the distance and angle between the benzene
rings of the two ligands indicates that pNP is rotated by about 36°
and further away from the active site by ~2.3 Å than HEMT
(Supplementary Fig. 5b). As a result, the phenyl group of pNP
becomes face-to-face stacked with the W156 indole (Fig.3b).
Activity analysis of PETase variants . Based on the above
structural analyses, additional variants were constructed and their
PET hydrolyzing activity was measured (Fig.3c). First, the DS1
disrupting variants C174S and C210S exhibited very low activity,
suggesting that DS1 is essential for PETase activity. As the variant
W156A showed low levels of MHET and TPA production (13.33
± 0.13 and 2.77± 0.04%), W156 also appears to be an important
residue for PETase activity. Notably, the conserved W156 residue
shows wobbling conformation and only W156 in“B” conforma-
tion is favorable for HEMT binding (Supplementary Figure8). As
mentioned above, the W156 wobbling is allowed due to the
presence of S185 in PETase but not in other homologous enzymes
that possesses a His residue in the corresponding position.
Therefore, the variant S185H was constructed and its activity
measured. The resulting 43.87± 0.30% MHET and 9.73± 0.77%
TPA production by S185H indicate that S185 has a role in PETase
catalysis, and His substitution partially compromises activity. In
addition, other HEMT-interacting residues including I179, W130,
and M132 are also essential, as each corresponding Ala variant
showed signiﬁcantly lower activity. Notably, replacing W130 with
a His, which is consistently observed in other homologous
enzymes, signiﬁcantly reduced the PETase activity. Y58, which
also interacts with HEMT, appears to play a minimal role in
hydrolyzing PET into MHET as Y58A exhibited 80.73% MHET
production. However, because this variant is inefﬁcient in TPA
production (8.60%), Y58 should be essential in further MHET
hydrolysis into TPA. A similar role is likely played by T59
because the variant T59A retained full activity in producing
MHET but showed lower activity in producing TPA (30.90%).
By taking together all these results, a catalytic pathway of
PETase can be proposed (Fig.4). The apo-form enzyme provides
a shallow cleft for substrate binding onto the protein surface, with
the W156 side chain in various conformations. When the enzyme
binds PET, the carbonyl group attached to the 1
st benzene ring is
directed toward the center of the substrate-binding cleft where the
catalytic triad carries out nucleophilic attack and the oxyanion
hole polarizes the ester bond and stabilizes the reaction
intermediate. The subsequent formation of acyl-enzyme inter-
mediate and second nucleophilic attack by a water molecule
follow the classical mechanism of action of cutinase
15. After the
ester bond is cleaved, the remaining benzoic acid group of the
product forms a broad planar surface which is readily face-to-face
stacked with the W156 side chain. Thus the product is rotated
and pulled away from the original, probably weaker, T-stacked
position before it is released.

enzymatic assays to identify key residues requires for catalysis.
PETase adopts a similar overall fold as related enzymes, but
harbors several unique structural features near the active center.
The enzyme possesses an additional disulﬁde bridge that links the
loops that bear the catalytic acid and base. This disulﬁde bridge
appears to play an important role in PETase function as activity is
severely compromised once DS1 is disrupted. The structures with
bound substrate and product analogs (HEMT and pNP) showed
both ligands bound to a shallow cleft formed mainly by hydro-
phobic residues on the protein surface. The mutagenesis results
indicate that these substrate-interacting residues are also impor-
tant for the enzymatic activity. One of them is W156, whose
conformation wobbles in the apo-form enzyme. It may facilitate
substrate binding and product leaving. Notably, the W156 wob-
bling is coupled to S185. The corresponding residue of S185 in
other homologous structures is a His, whose side chain prevents
the equivalent Trp to W156 from adopting alternative con-
formations. The reduced activity of the variant S185H suggests
that the outstanding performance of PETase dependents, at least
partially, on the presence of S185. In conclusion, this study
suggests substrate-binding mode in a PET-hydrolyzing enzyme,
which can provide guidance for further engineering and appli-
cations of PETase in the bioconversion of plastics.
Methods
Cloning. The PETase fromIdeonella sakaiensis (GenBank accession number:
GAP38373.1) without the N-terminal 29 amino acids was chemically synthesized
(GENE ray Biotech Co., Shanghai, China), ligated into the pET32a vector, and
expressed in Escherichia coli.
Site-directed mutagenesis. Variants were constructed by using a QuickChange
site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) with
the wild-type PETase plasmid as a template. R103G/S131A (DM) was constructed
by using S131A as the template. The sequences of the mutagenesis oligonucleotides
are listed in Supplementary Table1. The PCR products were incubated with DpnI
(New England Biolabs, Hitchin, UK) to digest the original DNA template and then
separately transformed intoE. colistrain XL1-Blue. The mutations were conﬁrmed
by sequencing.
Protein puriﬁcation. The pET32a-PETase plasmid, either wild type or variants,
was transformed intoE. coliBL21trxB(DE3) cells that were grown in LB medium at
37 °C to an OD
600 of ~0.8 and then induced by 0.6 mM isopropylβ-D-thioga-
lactopyranoside (IPTG) at 16 °C for 24 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at
5000 ×g for 15 min and then re-suspended in a lysis buffer containing 25 mM Tris-
HCl, 150 mM NaCl and 20 mM imidazole (pH 7.5), followed by disruption with a
French Press. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 17,000 ×g for 1 h. The
supernatant was then applied to a Ni-NTA column with FPLC system (GE
Healthcare). The target protein was eluted at ~70 mM imidazole when using a
20– 250 mM imidazole gradient. The target protein containing fractions were
pooled and dialyzed against a buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl and 150 mM
NaCl (pH 7.5), and subjected to TEV protease digestion overnight to remove the
His tag. The mixture was then passed through another Ni-NTA column. The
untagged protein was eluted with the imidazole free buffer. The purity of each
protein (>95%) was checked by SDS-PAGE analysis. The puriﬁed proteins were
each concentrated to 30 mg mL−1 for crystallization screening.
Structure determination and reﬁnement. All crystallization experiments were
conducted at 25 °C using the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method. In general, 1μL
PETase containing solution (25 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.5; 30 mg mL−1)
was mixed with 1μL of reservoir solution in 48-well Cryschem Plates, and equi-
librated against 100μL of the reservoir solution. The optimized crystallization
condition of PETase was 30% PEG6000 and 0.1 M MES (pH 6.0). The optimized
crystallization condition for S131A was 1.2 M ammonium sulfate, 0.2 M NaCl, 0.1
M Bis-Tris (pH 6.5), and for DM it was 1.1 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M NaCl, 0.1
M Hepes (pH 7.5). Within 3– 4 days, the crystals reached sizes suitable for X-ray
diffraction. The DM crystals in complex with pNP and HEMT were obtained by
soaking crystals with mother liquor containing 10 mM each compound for 50 h.
All X-ray diffraction data sets were collected at a wavelength of 1.00 Å on the
beam line BL15A1 and TPS05A in the National Synchrotron Radiation Research
Center (NSRRC) in Hsinchu, Taiwan. The crystals were mounted in a cryoloop and
soaked with cryoprotectant solution (wild-type crystal, 30% PEG6000, 0.15 M MES
(pH 6.0), 10% glycerol; S131A and DM crystal, 1.5 M ammonium sulfate, 0.3 M
NaCl, 0.15 M Bis-Tris (pH 6.5), 20% glycerol) prior to data collection at 100 K. The
diffraction images were processed using HKL2000
16. The crystal structure of wild
type PETase was solved by molecular replacement (MR) method with Phaser17
using the structure ofSaccharomonospora viridis cutinase-like enzyme (PDB ID
code 4WFI18, 47% sequence identity with PETase) as a search model. Further
reﬁnement was carried out by using the programs Refmac519 and Coot20. Five
percent randomly selected reﬂections were set aside for calculatingRfree as a
monitor. The variant and complex structures were determined by MR method with
Phaser using the reﬁned PETase structure as a search model. The 2Fo − Fc
difference Fourier maps showed clear electron densities for most amino-acid
residues. Subsequent reﬁnements by incorporating ligands and water molecules
were according to 1.0σ map level. The data collection and reﬁnement statistics are
summarized in Supplementary Table2. All ﬁgures of the protein and ligand
structures were prepared by using the PyMOL program (http://pymol.sourceforge.
net/).
PET modeling. A two-unit oligomer of PET was superimposed onto the bound
HEMT in the complex crystal structure based on the TPA moiety, whereas the
ethylene group connecting to the other TPA moiety in the PET took the place of
the hydroxyethyl group of HEMT. The position of the second TPA moiety was
adjusted manually by torsional rotations of the connecting single bonds while the
ﬁrst TPA remained largelyﬁxed. After eliminating most major clashes between the
non-hydrogen atoms of PET and PETase, the enzyme– substrate complex model
was subjected to several cycles of dynamic energy minimization by using
PHENIX
21.
Enzyme activity measurement. Puriﬁed protein was incubated with PETﬁlm (⌀6
mm) in a buffer containing 50 mM glycine-NaOH (pH 9.0) at 30 °C for 42 h. The
reaction was terminated by dilution of the aqueous solution with 160 mM phos-
phate buffer (pH 2.5) followed by heat treatment (85 °C, 10 min). The supernatant
was obtained by centrifugation (15,000 ×g, 10 min). After 0.22-μm ﬁltration, 20μL

of assay solution was analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatography
system (HPLC, Agilent 1200) equipped with a Welch Ultimate XB-C18 column
(4.6 × 250 mm, 5μm, Welch Materials, Inc., Shanghai, China). The mobile phase
was methanol with 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 2.5) at aﬂow rate of 0.8 mL min

condition was 0– 25 min with 25– 85% methanol linear gradient. The hydrolytic
products of MHET and TPA were identiﬁed by comparing the retention time of
standard compounds. The peak areas of MHET and TPA were calculated and
presented as percentage of the wild type enzyme products. All samples were
analyzed in triplicate in each independent experiment, from which the data were
averaged and the standard errors were calculated.
