Abstract: Extensive plastic production has become a serious environmental and health problem due
to the lack of efﬁcient treatment of plastic waste. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the most
used polymers and is accumulating in landﬁlls or elsewhere in nature at alarming rates. In recent
years, enzymatic degradation of PET by Ideonella sakaiensis PETase (IsPETase), a cutinase-like enzyme,
has emerged as a promising strategy to completely depolymerize this polymer into its building blocks.
Here, inspired by the architecture of cutinases and lipases homologous to IsPETase and using 3D
structure information of the enzyme, we rationally designed three mutations in IsPETase active site
for enhancing its PET-degrading activity. In particular, the S238Y mutant, located nearby the catalytic
triad, showed a degradation activity increased by 3.3-fold in comparison to the wild-type enzyme.
Importantly, this structural modiﬁcation favoured the function of the enzyme in breaking down highly
crystallized (~31%) PET, which is found in commercial soft drink bottles. In addition, microscopical
analysis of enzyme-treated PET samples showed that IsPETase acts better when the smooth surface
of highly crystalline PET is altered by mechanical stress. These results represent important progress
in the accomplishment of a sustainable and complete degradation of PET pollution.

1. Introduction
Plastics have become a crucial component of modern society due to their exceptional
mechanical and physical properties, including durability, ﬂexibility, and impermeability [1].
The demand for plastics led to the production of 367 Mt in 2020 [ 2]. However, only 9%
of plastic waste generated undergoes conventional recycling processes, with the rest end-
ing up in landﬁlls or elsewhere in the environment [3]. The continuing accumulation of
plastic raises signiﬁcant concerns about its impact on human and wildlife health. While
approximately 100,000 marine animals are killed every year by entanglement or inges-
tion of macroplastics (>5 mm) [4], recent studies suggest that microplastic (1 µm–5 mm)
contamination may reduce the survival of ﬁsh and cause oxidative stress and neurotoxic
effects that lead to behavioural disorders [ 5,6]. In humans, plastic pollution and its by-
products induce negative sequels in different organs, including the lungs, skin, liver, brain

and gastrointestinal system, which triggers an immune response, cell toxicity, cancer and
neurological disorders, along with other health issues [7].
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) (Figure 1), obtained by polycondensation of tereph-
thalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG) or the transesteriﬁcation of dimethyl terephtha-
late (DMT) and EG [8], is considered the most abundant thermoplastic material. Its low
price and remarkable durability and impermeability to liquids and gases make it ideal for
the fabrication of single-use soft drink bottles and packing [ 2]. Due to these favourable
properties, PET is highly resistant to biodegradation and accumulates in nature. New
materials with higher biodegradability, such as polylactic acid (PLA), polyhydroxyalka-
noate (PHA), and polybutylene succinate (PBS), have emerged as a measure to reduce
the environmental impact of PET [1]. However, certain applications in the food industry
require the use of packing materials exclusively made of PET [9] or using virgin PET [10] to
comply with safety regulations, which sustains PET consumption. This scenario highlights
the need for new strategies to recycle PET sustainably.
Figure 1. Chemical structure of IsPETase substrate and products. PET: polyethylene terephthalate,

terephthalic acid, EG: ethylene glycol.
PET is mostly recycled through thermal treatments, but these processes cause degrada-
tion of the polymer structure and loss of some mechanical properties required for beverage
bottles [11]. Alternatively, PET is depolymerised by pyrolysis or gasiﬁcation to yield fuels
used to produce heat and electricity. These processes are inexpensive and generate a high
proﬁt margin, but they have signiﬁcant environmental drawbacks, such as heavy pollution
and a contribution to the build-up of greenhouse gases [12]. Moreover, PET can be chem-
ically broken down into monomers using solvents, such as alcohol, and a catalyst. The
resulting monomers can be repolymerized into new PET with identical properties to virgin
plastic [13]. In spite of the beneﬁts inherent to obtaining plastic with ideal properties, this
process is inconvenient due to its high cost, and therefore, thermal treatments remain the
most viable option. The discovery of the bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6 and its ability
to use PET as the main carbon source for growth [14] has garnered signiﬁcant attention in
recent years. I. sakaiensis employs two enzymes, IsPETase and IsMHETase, for breaking
down PET into its building blocks (TPA and EG) (Figure 1). To date,I. sakaiensis represents a
unique example where extracellular degradation of PET takes place in order to incorporate
PET degradation products into cellular catabolism. IsPETase is a cutinase-like enzyme
that catalyses the depolymerization of PET into mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid

(MHET), with bis(2- hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (BHET) and TPA present in minor
amounts as by-products [14] (Figure 1). A similar PET degrading activity has also been
observed in cutinases from different organisms, including Thermobiﬁda fusca (TfuCut) [15],
Thermobiﬁda alba (TalCut) [16], and Thermoﬁda cellulosilytica (ThcCut) [17], but these are not
as efﬁcient as IsPETase. The second enzyme, IsMHETase, catalyses the conversion of MHET
into TPA and EG (Figure 1). The amounts of end-products generated in this pathway are
strongly inﬂuenced by the reaction performed by IsPETase. For that reason, multiple efforts
have focused on improving IsPETase activity and thermostability using rational approaches
that integrate critical architectural elements found in enzymes of the cutinase and lipase
families (Table 2). Nevertheless, the enzyme’s activity on highly crystalline PET, which is
found in most soft drink bottles, has not reached the threshold for industrial applicability
yet. Consequently, further investigation into novel modiﬁcations in the enzyme structure is
still required.

In this study, a rational protein engineering based on an extensive analysis of the
structure of IsPETase and different homologous enzymes was carried out with the aim to
increase the enzyme activity. Molecular docking and molecular dynamic (MD) simulations
suggested that three different single point mutations improve PET binding compared to
the wild-type (WT) enzyme. Two of these mutations were introduced nearby the catalytic
residue H237, which favour the binding afﬁnity of PET through the introduction of further
non-covalent interactions. A third mutation was introduced in the proximity of the active-
site cleft in order to alter the ﬂexibility of the loops that contour the active site. Examination
of enzyme-treated PET ﬁlms using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), atomic force
microscopy (AFM), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) showed that the IsPETase
mutant variants have an improved activity over crystalline PET ﬁlms compared to the WT
enzyme. This work could provide an important contribution to solving the environmental
problem caused by plastic pollution through effective depolymerization of PET.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Molecular Docking
The PET substrate used for modelling purposes consisted of one subunit of BHET and
one subunit of MHET (PET dimer). One initial three-dimensional conformer of the substrate
was generated with Omega [24,25] and partial atomic charges of type am1-bcc were added
to this conformer with Molcharge [26]. The structure of the IsPETase enzyme was obtained
from the Protein Data Bank database (PDB code 6EQE). The PET dimer was docked into
the active site of the enzyme with Gold [27]. The ChemPLP scoring function was selected
for primary docking and scoring. A total of 30 docking solutions were generated and
rescored with the GoldScore, ChemScore, and Astex Statistical Potential (ASP) scoring
functions implemented in Gold. The best docking solution was selected from a consensus
scoring scheme employed in previous research [28]. The binding mode of the products was
generated by breaking the PET dimer and adopting the best docking solution into MHET
and BHET.
2.2. Molecular Dynamic Simulations and Estimation of the Free Energies of Binding
Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations were performed with Amber 2022 [29] following
a previously described protocol [30,31]. Brieﬂy, the ff19SB and gaff2 force ﬁelds were used
for the parametrization of the protein and ligands, respectively. Complexes were enclosed
Polymers 2023, 15, 1779 5 of 15
in truncated octahedron boxes and solvated with Optimal Point Charge (OPC) water
molecules. Excess net charges were neutralized by adding sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl−)
counterions at a concentration of 150 mM [32]. Two stages of energy minimization were
performed, with the solute restrained during the ﬁrst of these and with no restrains during
the second one. The energy minimized systems were gradually heated from 0 to 300 K,
and equilibrated for 100 ps. The equilibrated systems were used as input to ﬁve short 4 ns
MD simulations performed in the isobaric-isothermal (NPT) ensemble. Each MD replica
was run with different random initial velocities for a better exploration of the complexes’
conformational space. The free energies of binding were estimated with the Molecular
Mechanics-Generalized Born and Surface Area (MM-GBSA) method, as implemented in
Amber 2022. For a complex, these calculations took place with 100 MD snapshots evenly
drawn from all ﬁve MD replicas and covering the 1 ns–4 ns time interval. For each variant
of the IsPETase enzyme, the free energies of binding were computed for the PET dimer and
the reaction products.
2.3. Construction of the IsPETase Mutants
The IsPETase mutant variants were designed based on a comparison of theIsPETase
substrate-binding site residues with those present in homologous enzymes, similar to
that reported previously [18]. First, the amino acid sequences of different α/β hydrolases
homologous to IsPETase were identiﬁed using PDBeFold and UniProt’s Basic Local Align-
ment Search Tool (BLAST) [33]. Then, the natural substitutions that occur in the residues
that contour the substrate-binding site in the homologous enzymes were identiﬁed by
multiple sequence alignment using ClustalOmega [34] and WebLogo [35] and assessed by
MD simulations.
All of the constructs for the mutants were obtained using the QuickChange ® Site-
Directed Mutagenesis kit (Agilent, Foster City, CA, USA) as described previously [36]. In
brief, the wild-type IsPETase expression vector, which was previously codon optimized
for expression in Escherichia coli and cloned into pET21b(+) with a C-terminus His-tag
(pET21b(+)-IsPETase) [18], was obtained from Addgene. The pET21b(+)- IsPETase vec-
tor was ampliﬁed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using the PfuUltra polymerase
with the primers I208V-F: 5′-GAGAATGATAGCTGGGCACCGGTGAAC-3′, I208V-R: 5′-
GTTCACCGGTGCCCAGCTATCATTCTC-3′, N212A-F: 5′-ATTGCACCGGTGGCGAGCA
GCGCGCTG-3′, N212A-R: 5′-CAGCGCGCTGCTCGCCACCGGTGCAAT-3′, S238Y-F: 5′-
GGCGGTAGCCACTATTGTGCCAACTCT-3′, and S238Y-R: 5′-AGAGTTGGCACAATAGTG
GCTACCGCC-3′. The parental plasmid was then digested with 1 unit of Dpn I restriction
enzyme for 2 h at 37 ◦C, and the resultant mutant IsPETase-containing constructs were
immediately transformed into E. coli DH5α chemically competent cells using the heat-shock
method [37]. The introduction of each single point mutation was conﬁrmed by Sanger
sequencing.
2.4. Enzyme Expression and Puriﬁcation
The wild type and mutant IsPETase variants were expressed and puriﬁed as reported
previously [18,20,38] with some modiﬁcations. All expression vectors were transformed
into E. coli BL21(DE3) Rosetta gami-B chemically competent cells. A single colony was trans-
ferred to 50 mL of Lysogeny Broth (LB) media supplemented with ampicillin (100 µg/mL)
and incubated overnight at 37 ◦C with constant agitation (230 opm). This culture was
transferred to 1 L of Terriﬁc Broth media and incubated at 37 ◦C with constant agitation
(200 opm) and, when the optical density (OD600) reached 2.0, the expression of the protein
was induced with 0.1 mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 20 ◦C and
200 opm during 18–24 h. The bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 ◦C,
3900×g for 20 min, and the cell pellet was collected and kept at −70 ◦C. All subsequent
operations were performed at 4 ◦C. For lysis, the pellet was resuspended in buffer A
(25 mM Tris, 150 mM sodium chloride, 20 mM imidazole, pH 7.5) supplemented with 0.5%
Triton X-100 and 10 µL/mL 0.5 M ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and DNase. The
Polymers 2023, 15, 1779 6 of 15
cell suspension was incubated for 15 min and then sonicated in an ultrasonic cell crusher
(650 W, MRC, Harlow, UK for 10×10 s at a constant duty cycle, with rest intervals of 10 s.
The cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 21,100×g for 1 h. The supernatant was
loaded onto a HisTrap™ HP column (Cytiva, Uppsala, Sweden), previously equilibrated
with buffer A, using a FPLC system (ÄKTA Start, Cytiva, Uppsala, Sweden). The unbound
proteins were removed with 10 column volumes (cv) of buffer A, and the enzyme was
eluted with a gradient of 20–500 mM imidazole. The ﬂow-through was collected and
the fractions containing the enzyme were pooled and loaded onto a PD-10 desalting col-
umn (GE Health Care, Uppsala, Sweden) previously equilibrated with a buffer containing
25 mM Tris, 150 mM sodium chloride, and pH 7.5. The puriﬁed enzyme was stored in
50 µL aliquots at −70 ◦C. Enzyme purity was assessed by denaturing polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). All chemicals used were of analytical grade and were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), unless otherwise stated.
2.5. PET Degradation Assay
Circular PET ﬁlms (6 mm diameter, 0.213 mm thick) cut from transparent commercial
PET bottles were washed with sterile deionized water and dried at room temperature for
48 h before enzymatic treatment. The ﬁlms were treated in 500 µL of a buffer containing
50 mM glycine-sodium hydroxide (NaOH), pH 9.4, with and without 500 nM enzyme. All
samples were incubated at 30 ◦C for 72 h. The reaction was stopped by aqueous dilution
with 20 mM phosphate, 12% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) pH 2.5, and the precipitated
enzyme was removed by centrifugation at 13,500×g for 10 min [14]. Then, the PET ﬁlms
were washed with 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), distilled water, and ethanol. Finally,
the ﬁlms were air-dried for SEM, AFM, and DSC [18].
2.6. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)
Dried samples were cleaned with nitrogen gas and then mounted on carbon tape and
secured with silver tape on a SEM stub and then metalized using a sputter coater (Q150R ES,
Quorum, Laughton, UK). Surface morphology of the control and IsPETase-treated samples
was evaluated using a ﬁeld emission scanning electron microscope (MIRA 3, TESCAN,
Brno, Czech Republic) operating at 5 kV .
2.7. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM)
Nanoscopic corrugation measurements were performed using an atomic force micro-
scope (XE7, Park Systems, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Samples were attached to the sample
holder with double-sided tape. Without any additional treatment, ﬁlm surfaces were
scanned in the non-contact mode under ambient conditions using PPP-CONTSCR com-
mercial silicon cantilever tips (0.2 N/m, 25 kHz, <7 nm typical radius). All images were
acquired at 512 ×512 pixels. AFM image edition was restricted to only a single polynomial
levelling, performed using the Park System’s XEI software, version 5.1.6 build 1.
2.8. PET Crystallinity Assay
The thermal crystallinity of PET was assayed using a differential scanning calorimeter
(DSC3 STARe System, Mettler Toledo, Urdorf, Switzerland). In summary, 6 mg of PET
ﬁlm was equilibrated at 25 ◦C, heated to 300 ◦C at 10 ◦C/min, held at 300 ◦C for 1 min,
and cooled down to 25 ◦C at 10 ◦C/min. The experiment was carried out in a nitrogen
(N2) atmosphere (50 mL/min). The percent crystallinity (%Xc) of PET was determined as
described previously [39] using Equation (1).
%Xc =
[ ∆Hm −∆Hc

∗100 (1)
where ∆Hm is the heat of melting, ∆Hc is the heat of cold crystallization, and ∆Hm◦is the
heat of melting of ideal PET crystals measured at the equilibrium melting point (140.1 J/g).

3. Results and Discussion
3.1. IsPETase Engineering for Enhancing PET-Degrading Activity
To date, IsPETase constitutes the most efﬁcient PET-degrading enzyme known. Com-
pared to other enzymes that are able to hydrolyse PET, such asTfuCut, leaf-branch com-
post cutinase (LCC) and Fusarium solani cutinase (FsCut), this enzyme exhibits between
9 and 19.3-fold increased activity when using low-crystallinity (1.9%) PET ﬁlms as the
substrate [14]. However, IsPETase degrading activity is still insufﬁcient for being used in
the PET recycling industry, and biodegradation of PET pollution remains a major challenge
due to the poor enzyme accessibility into the structure of highly crystallized PET used
to manufacture beverage bottles. To overcome these problems, based on the previously
reported crystal structure of IsPETase (PDB code 6EQE), molecular docking of PET and MD
simulations, we designed three different single point mutations inspired in the architecture
of 39 IsPETase homologous enzymes of the cutinase and lipase families (Figure 2A). MD
simulations showed that PET binds to a cleft contoured by 14 residues located at the protein
surface (Figure 2B). These include S160 and H237, which in consort with D206, conform the
catalytic triad present in other enzymes of the α/β hydrolase superfamily [18] (Figure S1).
We hypothesized that substitutions introduced nearby the catalytic residues could posi-
tively impact the binding afﬁnity of the substrate, and consequently, the enzyme activity.
S160 is ﬂanked by W159 and W185, a highly conserved residue critical for enzyme activity
(Table 2). On the other hand, H237 is ﬂanked by I208 and S238, which also form part of
the binding pocket (Figure 2B,C). A multiple sequence alignment (Figure S1) showed that
most IsPETase homologous enzymes possess the W159H substitution, which confers an
increased PET-degrading activity alone [19] or in combination with S238F [18], compared
to the WT enzyme (Table 2). A greater variability was noted at positions I208 and S238,
with two and six potential substitutions, respectively. Overall, we noted that the mutations
I208V , S238F, and S238Y are more frequent in cutinases and lipases (Figure 2A). As stated
above, the mutations W159H and S238F have previously been tested (Table 2); therefore,
these were excluded in this study. A third position outside the binding pocket was also
considered with the aim to alter the ﬂexibility of the loop (E204-S214) that connects the α5
helix and the β7 strand, where D206 is located. The residue N212 was chosen for protein
engineering due to its low level of conservation across all enzymes, and its position in the
protein structure, with the side chain atoms exposed to the solvent (Figure 2A,B).
MD calculations served to discriminate the best mutant candidates regarding the
values of free energy ( ∆G) of substrate and products binding (Table 3), compared with
those predicted when PET (−21.20 kcal/mol) or MHET (−17.94 kcal/mol) bind the WT.
Interestingly, engineeringIsPETase to adopt a cutinase/lipase-like active site through the
introduction of I208V or S238Y mutations increased the binding afﬁnity of PET by 20%
(−25.50 kcal/mol) without altering the afﬁnity of the reaction products. A similar result
was observed when the asparagine at position 212 was mutated to alanine (∆G PET binding
= −28.36 kcal/mol) (Table 3). Thus, we generated the IsPETase I208V , S238Y, and N212A
variants using mutagenic PCR. The enzymes were then expressed in E. coli and isolated by
afﬁnity chromatography.

3.2. Modiﬁed IsPETase Exhibits Increased PET-Degrading Activity over Highly Crystallized PET
As mentioned above, in the original research report where IsPETase was isolated and
characterized, Yoshida et al. [14] used low crystallinity (1.9%) PET to examine the ability of
the enzyme to digest this polymer. In contrast, PET waste remains a challenge for recycling
because it usually shows a much higher degree of crystallinity, which reduces the enzyme’s
esterase activity. Here, we performed enzyme-mediated PET degradation assays using
coupons (6 mm diameter, 0.213 mm thick) mechanically cut from commercial soft-drink
PET bottles with 30.88% crystallinity (determined by DSC).
SEM microphotographs of the control sample and those treated with the WT and
mutant enzymes were acquired at different magniﬁcations to evaluate their surface mor-
phology. SEM microphotographs showed the existence of surface defects in the form of
channels in all the samples (Figure 3, top left corner), possibly originated from the ma-
nipulation of the ﬁlms. Considering this fact, the surface of the samples was evaluated
inside and outside the surface defects. It could be noticed that the control sample exhibits a
smoother surface (ﬁrst row in Figure 3) compared to the enzyme-treated samples (second
to ﬁfth rows in Figure 3). The enzymes induced a granular texture and pitting on the PET
ﬁlm surface, a clear sign that these were degraded the polymer. These ﬁndings indicated
that the enzyme could break down PET that is highly crystalline, and that the process is
comparable to when the enzyme breaks down PET with lower crystallinity levels (1.9% [14]
or 14.8% crystallinity [18]). In addition, we observed that, in all enzyme-treated ﬁlms, there
is a greater change in the morphology inside the surface defects. Therefore, we inferred that
the enzyme activity is initiated and accentuated in those parts that previously presented
Polymers 2023, 15, 1779 9 of 15
surface defects, most likely due to favoured polyester chain ﬂexibility [ 40] induced by
mechanical stress. Amongst the three mutants, PET ﬁlms treated with the I208V variant
showed fewer changes in the morphology of the PET surface compared to the WT and the
N212 and S238Y variants, suggesting a decreased PET-degrading activity. Interestingly, the
S238Y mutant induced a severe degradation of the PET ﬁlm surface and the formation of
microscopic PET ﬁlaments in the order of several hundred of nanometers wide (typically
around 200 nm) inside and outside the surface defects (bottom row in Figure 3). This
ﬁnding constitutes the ﬁrst report where an IsPETase mutant variant produced this type
of degradation of PET, since all previous data found in the literature has only shown a
prominent pitting [14,18].

A similar type of PET surface morphology modiﬁcations was observed in AFM char-
acterizations. AFM conﬁrmed SEM surface observations by permitting topographic proﬁle
measurements on samples without any coating. We analyzed the PET ﬁlm surface using
Polymers 2023, 15, 1779 10 of 15
2D and 3D views and the AFM proﬁle. The 2D AFM topographic images represent zenithal
views of the height data recorded at each sample using a colour code to describe the ele-
vation values. The 3D AFM images display the same surface using a three-dimensional
perspective. Proﬁle diagrams depict linear altitudes measured along the line highlighted
on the 2D corresponding picture. A comparison at the nanoscale between enzyme-treated
samples and the buffer-treated PET ﬁlms revealed important topographic modiﬁcations
of the PET surfaces in agreement with a previous report [ 41]. These can be observed at
the proﬁle corrugation contrast between control and sample scans presented in Figure 4.
Furthermore, the results show that the WT and N212A mutant apparently attack the PET
sample heterogeneously, degrading some regions more intensively than others and pro-
ducing a hollowed surface (see WT and N212A images in Figure 4). This suggests that, at
the nanoscale, PET bottles may show some degree of heterogeneity, and IsPETase could
attack ﬁrst spots with more ﬂexible polymer chains exposed on the original PET surface.
On the contrary, the I208V mutant may damage the PET more homogeneously, creating
a ﬂatter but granular structure, as displayed in picture I208I of Figure 4. In the particular
case of S238Y, ﬁlamentous degradation protrusions beyond 17 times above the highest
corrugation measured on the other samples were detected, in agreement with SEM images
shown previously. In addition, PET surfaces treated with the S238Y variant exhibit hollows
15-fold deeper compared to those observed for the WT-treated PET ﬁlm. In a previous
report [41], AFM observations suggested that the enzymatic degradation of PET induces
the corrugation of the ﬁlm surface in a time-dependent manner and attributed this change
to the accumulation of the BHET product on the polymer surface. Here, our SEM and AFM
measurements suggest a similar type of corrugation for all enzyme variants, except for the
S238Y mutant that induced a hollowed surface. This could indicate that the activity of the
S238Y mutant does not produce signiﬁcant amounts of BHET and principally yields MHET
or TPA.

In order to further characterize the PET-degrading activity of the mutant variants,
changes on the structure of the polymer were analysed using DSC. Similar to that reported
previously [18], IsPETase induced a reduction in the crystallinity of PET. All three mutant
variants performed differently than the WT enzyme under this observation, with the S238Y
and the N212A mutants showing 3.3- and 1.4-fold increased activity, respectively. In
contrast, the I208V mutant barely altered the crystalline structure of PET (Figure 5).
These results provided some clues about the mechanism of action of the IsPETase
mutant variants created in this study. First, our MD calculations predicted an increased
binding afﬁnity of PET to the I208V mutant compared to the WT enzyme (Table 3). How-
ever, in vitro assays showed a decreased degrading activity. A possible explanation to
these results is that the substitution of isoleucine for valine disrupts several non-covalent
interactions formed between the Cδ of the isoleucine and the side chain atoms of H237, a
key residue part of the catalytic triad (Figures 2 and 6). These interactions orient the imida-
zole ring of H237 towards S160, allowing its deprotonation [18,20]. Thus, the substitution
I208V may have contributed to a greater ﬂexibility of H237, reducing the enzyme turnover.
On the other hand, the S238Y mutation allows the aromatic side chain of the introduced
tyrosine residue to position favourably for aπ-π stacking interaction with the PET substrate
(Figure 6), similar to that observed when this residue is mutated to phenylalanine [18,42].
This interaction could lead to a better afﬁnity of the mutated enzyme for PET relative to
the WT serine residue. Finally, despite N212 not being directly involved in the recognition
of the substrate, its mutation to alanine could have a favourable structural impact on the
Polymers 2023, 15, 1779 12 of 15
enzyme’s mechanism. In the WT enzyme, N212 is located at the beginning of aα-helix and
points to the solvent. The N212A mutation could make this portion of the helix move closer
to the rest of the protein, affecting the loop 204–210 that we speculate moves to narrow the
PET binding channel. In addition, the displacement of the 204–210 loop could position the
catalytic residue D206 in a more favourable location for catalysis (Figure 6).

4. Conclusions
In the present study, IsPETase mutants were engineered for enhancing PET-degrading
activity using a computational rational design approach of the enzyme’s active site. This
was achieved by comparing the 3D structure of IsPETase with that of homologous esterase-
like enzymes (cutinases and lipases). In particular, the S238Y substitution provoked a
substantially increased PET-degrading activity, expressed in the form of modiﬁcations of
the PET surface and crystallinity loss, when using highly crystalline PET from commercial
PET bottles as substrate. To date, PET recycling is mostly conducted via thermal treatments
that produce dangerous gas emissions, linked to severe health and environmental issues.
The results presented here prove the concept that taking advantage of IsPETase’s recent
Polymers 2023, 15, 1779 13 of 15
evolution to adopt a PET-degrading activity could facilitate PET pollution management in
a sustainable manner and that the introduction of single-point mutations in the enzyme
architecture can signiﬁcantly impact its applicability in the recycling industry. Moreover, the
methodology presented in this study provides a ﬁrst step towards rapidly identifying new
potential mutations of the enzyme for enhancing its activity. This investigation adds new
information about the important role of I208 in catalysis and contributes to understanding
the mechanism of PET degradation by IsPETase.
It has been shown that treatment of the PET surface with physical or chemical agents
(detergents, organic solvents, heat, or alkali) enhances IsPETase activity, most likely by
promoting an amorphous conformation of the polymer chains and improving the enzyme’s
accessibility to the substrate. Here, we identiﬁed that the performance of IsPETase is
improved when PET suffers mechanical stress over its smooth surface. This ﬁnding could
be highly important in the recycling context since it provides new information for designing
pre-treatments for the enzymatic treatment of PET pollution that accumulates in landﬁlls
and the environment.
