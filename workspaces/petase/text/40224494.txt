ABSTRACT: Management of polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
plastic waste remains a challenge. PET-hydrolyzing enzymes
(PHEs) such as IsPETase and variants like FAST-PETase
demonstrate promising PET depolymerization capabilities at
ambient temperatures and can be utilized to recycle and upcycle
plastic waste. Whole-cell biocatalysts displaying PHEs on their
surface offer high efficiency, reusability, and stability for PET
depolymerization. However, their efficacy in fully breaking down
PET is hindered by the necessity of two enzymes: PETase and
MHETase. Current whole-cell systems either display only one
enzyme or struggle with performance when displaying larger
enzymes such as the MHETase−PETase chimera. We developed a
Saccharomyces cerevisiae-based whole-cell biocatalyst for complete depolymerization of PET into its constituent monomers with no
accumulation of intermediate products. Leveraging a cellulosome-inspired trifunctional protein scaffoldin displayed on the yeast
surface, we co-immobilized FAST-PETase and MHETase, forming a multi-enzyme cluster. This whole-cell biocatalyst achieved
complete PET depolymerization at 30 °C, yielding 4.95 mM terephthalic acid (TPA) when tested on a PET film. Furthermore, we
showed improved PET depolymerization ability by binding FAST-PETase at multiple sites on the scaffoldin. The whole cells had the
added advantage of retained activity over multiple reusability cycles. This breakthrough in complete PET depolymerization marks a
step toward a circular plastic economy.

INTRODUCTION
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic has become ubiq-
uitous in daily life, with an estimated annual global production
of 82 million tonnes.
1
However, since only a small fraction of
this produced plastic is recycled (<20%), PET waste
management is a daunting challenge.
2
PET can be recycled
via mechanical, chemical, or biological methods.
3,4
Enzymatic
biocatalysis is emerging as a green route for plastic waste
recycling and could also open up new avenues for “upcycling”
waste into higher-value products.
5,6
Many PET-hydrolyzing enzymes (PHEs) have been
identified and engineered for enzymatic PET recycling.
7,8
The mesophilic enzyme IsPETase, secreted by Ideonella
sakaiensis, exhibited PET depolymerization at ambient temper-
atures.
9
Engineered IsPETase variants with improved activity
and thermostability have since been developed,
10,11
with
FAST-PETase
12
exhibiting superior performance. Whole-cell
biocatalysis is a promising approach to achieving PET
depolymerization using enzymatic systems. By displaying
PET-degrading enzymes on the surface of a prokaryotic or
eukaryotic cell, promising PET depolymerization performance
has been obtained.
13−18
The benefits of these systems include
improved activity due to reduced enzyme aggregation,
14
reusability, and enhanced enzyme stability.
19
Aggregation of
free PETase at high concentrations (>100 nM) significantly
limits its performance, and enzyme immobilization is an
effective strategy to reduce aggregation and improve PET
degradation activity.
9,14
However, to achieve complete depolymerization of PET into
its constituent monomers, terephthalic acid (TPA) and
ethylene glycol (EG), without the accumulation of inter-
mediate products, enzymatic partner MHETase is also
required.

PETase and MHETase work synergistically to
completely degrade PET, with MHETase−PETase fusion

enzymes exhibiting even better performance than free enzyme
mixtures.
20,21
Additionally, the accumulation of intermediate
product mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) in the
absence of MHETase inhibits enzyme activity.
21−23
A major
drawback of existing PETase-based whole-cell biocatalysts is
their ability to display only one enzyme efficiently on their
surface.
13−17
Poor performance
18
or incomplete conversion
24
is observed when larger passenger enzymes like the
MHETase−PETase chimera are displayed on the surface.
Thus, complete PET depolymerization into its constituent
monomers with no accumulation of intermediates remains
challenging in such systems.
To efficiently hydrolyze recalcitrant polymers like cellulose,
certain anaerobic bacteria have developed multienzyme
complexes called cellulosomes.
25
Inspired by these natural
systems, artificial, designer cellulosomes have been developed
by recruiting necessary cellulose-hydrolyzing enzymes on a
microbial surface scaffold with sequence, distance, and ratio
specificity, exhibiting superior performance compared with free
enzymes.
26−28
In this work, we developed a cellulosome-inspired
Saccharomyces cerevisiae-based whole-cell biocatalyst system
capable of complete depolymerization of PET to TPA and EG.
Previous research has demonstrated the excellent surface
display capabilities of S. cerevisiae-based systems.
29,30
Addi-
tionally, the scaffoldin-based approach eliminates the need for
exhaustive experimental screening to surface display enzymes,
thus rendering it highly direct.
28,31,32
This approach also
harnesses the benefits of enzyme proximity, substrate
channeling, and synergy, which has led to efficient substrate
degradation in cellulosome-based systems.
33,34
FAST-PETase
and MHETase were bound on a trifunctional protein scaffold
displayed on the yeast cell surface through high-affinity
cohesin−dockerin interactions. We confirmed the scaffoldin’s
display on the yeast cell surface and successful binding of each
enzyme to this scaffoldin. Subsequently, we assessed the PET
depolymerization activity of this biocatalyst and showcased its
capability to completely break down PET into TPA and EG.
Finally, we evaluated the reusability of the whole-cell
biocatalyst for enzymatic activity assays after separating it
from the reaction medium via centrifugation. This work is
valuable for achieving eco-friendly plastic waste management.

METHODS AND MATERIALS
Yeast Culture and Display of Trifunctional Scaffoldin
on the Yeast Cell Surface. S. cerevisiae strain EBY100
(MATa AGA1::GAL1-AGA1::URA3 ura3-52 trp1 leu2-1 his3-
200 pep4::HIS3 prb1-1.6R can1 GAL) transformed with pScaf-
ctf
26
was used for the surface display of the trifunctional
scaffoldin. S. cerevisiae EBY100 without the pScaf-ctf plasmid
served as a negative control. Detailed information regarding
culture conditions is provided in Section S2 of the Supporting
Information.
Expression and Purification of PET-Degrading En-
zymes. Sequences of gene fragments encoding dockerins
(Doc) from Clostridium cellulolyticum (Doc Cc), Clostridium
thermocellum (Doc Ct), and Ruminococcus f lavefaciens (Doc Rf)
were obtained using a process from a previous publication.
26
Dockerin-tagged FAST-PETase and MHETase were con-
structed by fusing the dockerins at the C-terminus of the
protein of interest separated by a flexible GS linker and
transformed into Escherichia coli NEB 5-alpha. The constructed
plasmids were transformed into E. coli SHuffle T7 for protein
expression. Detailed information regarding induction con-
ditions is provided in Section S3.
After protein expression and cell lysis, the proteins were
purified by His-tag purification, followed by concentration and
buffer exchange into exchange buffer (50 mM HEPES, 100
mM NaCl, pH 8). Protein purity was assessed using sodium
dodecyl sulfate−polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS−
PAGE) (Figure S4) and quantified using Bio-Rad Image Lab
software. The protein concentration was determined using a
Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay.
Enzyme Assembly on the Yeast Cell Surface. Yeast
cells displaying the scaffoldin were resuspended in binding
buffer (50 mM Tris HCl, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM CaCl
2
, pH
8). Subsequently, purified dockerin-tagged enzymes were
added and incubated with the yeast cells at 20 °C for 1.5 h
with continuous shaking. After incubation, the yeast cells were
washed with 1× phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to remove
unbound dockerins and resuspended in binding buffer for
activity assays.
Enzyme Activity Assays on PET. Amorphous PET film
(Goodfellow ES301445, crystallinity of 4.2 ± 2%, number-
average molar mass (M
n
) of 19.7 ± 8.3 kDa, weight-average
molar mass (M
w
) of 33.8 ± 6.8 kDa)
22
was used as a substrate
to test the PET hydrolytic activity. Circular PET films
(diameter of 6 mm, initial weight of 9 mg) were washed
with 1% SDS, 20% ethanol, and deionized water prior to use.
One film was added to a glass test tube containing 300 μL of
yeast cells (OD
600
= 10) (Figure S3) and incubated at 30 °C
and 250 rpm on an orbital shaker. Samples were collected
periodically to quantify the reaction products.
To obtain samples for the analysis of PET degradation
products, the reaction mixture was separated from the PET
film and centrifuged to remove yeast cells. The supernatant
thus obtained was heated at 85 °C for 20 min to ensure that
there was no residual enzyme activity, followed by analysis
using a HPLC instrument equipped with a diode array detector
(detection wavelength of 240 nm). MHET and TPA formation
was quantified by comparison against a standard curve
prepared using commercially available standards. Detailed
information regarding the HPLC method is provided in
Section S3.
Confirmation of the Scaffoldin Surface Display and
Determination of the FAST-PETase Saturation Concen-
tration. To confirm the surface display of the scaffoldin, S.
cerevisiae cells (OD
600
= 1) were centrifuged and washed with
1× PBS. The cells were resuspended in 100 μL of blocking
buffer (1× PBS containing 1 mg/mL bovine serum albumin
(BSA)) and left on a nutator for 1 h for blocking, followed by
incubation with the primary anti-C-myc antibody (#2278, Cell
Signaling Technology) at 4 °C overnight. The cells were then
washed with 1× PBS and resuspended in blocking buffer,
followed by incubation with an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated
secondary antibody (#4412, Cell Signaling Technology) at
room temperature for 2 h in the dark. After washing with
1×PBS, the fluorescence was measured using a microplate
reader (λ
ex
= 488 nm; λ
em
= 530 nm).
To determine the saturation concentration of FAST-
PETase-Dockerin Rf (FP-Rf) and FAST-PETase-Dockerin
Cc (FP-Cc) on the scaffoldin, equimolar amounts of both
enzymes were bound to the scaffoldin using the enzyme
assembly protocol. S. cerevisiae cells (OD
600
= 5) containing
the bound dockerins were centrifuged, washed, and then
blocked for 1 h in blocking buffer. They were then incubated

with the anti-C-His antibody conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488
(#14930, Cell Signaling Technology) for 1 h at room
temperature in the dark. The fluorescence was measured
after washing with 1×PBS (λ
ex
= 488 nm; λ
em
= 530 nm).
Reusability of the Whole-Cell Biocatalyst. p-Nitro-
phenyl acetate (pNPA) was used as a substrate to determine
the relative activity of new and reused whole cells. First, 20 μL
portions of yeast cells (OD
600
= 20) bound with all three
enzymes were added to 175 μL of PBS, followed by addition of
5 μL of pNPA in DMSO (final pNPA concentration of 1 mM,
30 °C) in a 96-well plate. p-Nitrophenol (pNP) release was
monitored by measuring the absorbance at 405 nm using a
microplate reader. The enzyme activity was calculated as the
ratio of the slope of the linear region of the pNP release curve
and OD
600
of the cells. After each pNPA hydrolysis cycle, the
yeast cells were centrifuged and washed with 1×PBS to remove
residual components from the previous cycle.

cellulose-binding domain (CBD) from C. thermocellum was
displayed on the surface of the S. cerevisiae cell using the
Aga1−Aga2 system (Figure 1A).
26
A C-myc tag on the
scaffoldin was utilized to verify its surface display. Upon
incubating S. cerevisiae with a fluorophore-conjugated anti-C-
myc antibody, a considerably higher fluorescence intensity was
observed in the scaffoldin-displaying cells compared to wild-
type whole cells (Figure 1B), confirming the surface local-
ization of the scaffoldin.
Binding of PET-Degrading Enzymes on the Scaffol-
din. Previous studies have reported that high PETase loading
leads to high degradation performance and even low
MHETase concentrations are sufficient to boost product
release and convert all MHET into TPA.
20
Based on this
understanding, we hypothesized that attaching FAST-PETase
at two different sites would allow higher FAST-PETase
concentrations than single-site attachment of FAST-PETase,
promoting efficient PET depolymerization. We utilized FP-Rf
and FP-Cc to immobilize FAST-PETase on the surface
scaffoldin and MHETase-Doc Ct (MH-Ct) for MHETase
immobilization (Figure 1).
We determined the saturation concentration of FAST-
PETase on the scaffoldin by incubating varying concentrations
of FP-Rf and FP-Cc with yeast cells (Figure S1). This
concentration of the FAST-PETase dockerin enzymes was
used for activity assays on the PET film. Simultaneously, MH-
Ct was co-incubated with these yeast cells.
PET Depolymerization Performance of the Whole-
Cell Biocatalyst. Following the incubation of S. cerevisiae
whole cells with the PET film substrate, we analyzed the
supernatant using HPLC to monitor MHET and TPA
formation. When only FAST-PETase dockerins were present
on the scaffoldin, both MHET and TPA were formed (Figure
2, Figure S2). When MH-Ct was present on the scaffoldin
along with FP-Cc or FP-Rf, we observed complete PET
depolymerization, yielding only TPA as the reaction product
with no accumulation of MHET or other reaction
intermediates (Figure 2, Figure S2). Since MHETase, even
in a small amount relative to FAST-PETase, is required for the
degradation of PET to its constituent monomers, this
demonstrates that each enzyme, including FAST-PETase and
MHETase, was active after binding to the scaffoldin, and the
PETase−MHETase pair was able to completely depolymerize
PET to TPA and EG. As expected, MH-Ct alone did not show
any activity on the PET film (data not shown).
Meanwhile, when wild-type yeast cells (without scaffoldin)
were incubated with all three enzymes, we observed negligible
TPA formation compared to the scaffoldin-displaying cells.
This confirmed minimal nonspecific enzyme binding on the
yeast surface in the absence of the scaffoldin (Figure 2C).
Total product formation was significantly boosted when
MH-Ct was co-immobilized with FP-Rf or FP-Cc (Figure
2A,B). This could be attributed to the inhibitory effect of
MHET accumulation in the absence of MHETase, which has
been shown to detrimentally impact PETase activity.
21,22
We also explored the effect of having two FAST-PETases
and one MHETase on the scaffoldin to further enhance the
concentration of the FAST-PETase in the depolymerization
reaction. The three-enzyme system exhibited up to 1.6 times
better depolymerization performance than the two-enzyme
counterparts throughout day 4, with mean TPA yields of 2
mM. This improvement in product yields can be attributed to
cooperative PET depolymerization by both FAST-PETase
dockerins.
Throughout day 7 (Figure 2B), the whole cells remained
active, with an up to 2.4-fold increase in TPA production
relative to day 4. Notably, two FAST-PETases and one
MHETase on the scaffoldin proved to be extremely beneficial,
resulting in a 1.8-fold increase relative to that of FP-Cc (with
MH-Ct). When all three enzymes were bound to the
scaffoldin, a TPA yield of 4.95 mM was obtained after
incubation with the PET film for 7 days. This corresponds to a
degradation rate of 124.7 μg day
−1
cm
−2
, which is 4.7-fold
higher than the highest reported whole-cell biocatalyst
degradation rate observed by an E. coli-based surface display
system using the YeeJ autotransporter under its optimum
conditions on an amorphous PET film.
14
Thus, we successfully
demonstrated a highly efficient yeast-based whole-cell
biocatalyst system that could simultaneously immobilize
multiple FAST-PETases and MHETase on the cell surface
for efficient and complete depolymerization of PET to its
monomeric constituents. The high surface display efficiency of
yeast, ease of genetic modification and culturing, and generally
regarded as safe (GRAS) status make it an extremely
advantageous host for bioremediation.
35
Reusability of Whole-Cell Biocatalysts. Whole-cell
biocatalysts can be easily separated from the reaction medium
through centrifugation, filtration, and sedimentation, facilitat-
ing use over multiple reaction cycles.
16
The reusability of this
yeast biocatalyst was determined by using a pNPA hydrolytic
assay. The cells were recovered easily by centrifugation and
showed promising reusability. Although we observed a nearly
25% decrease in activity in the first reusability cycle, the
biocatalyst retained activity over five subsequent cycles (Figure
3). This strongly demonstrates that the whole-cell biocatalyst
can be reused for multiple rounds.

DISCUSSION
Incomplete depolymerization with accumulation of reaction
intermediates
24
or compromised activity
18
had proven to be a
challenge for existing surface display systems being used for
PET degradation. Our work leveraged the high surface display
efficiency of S. cerevisiae and the benefits of enzyme proximity
and substrate channeling provided by a protein scaffoldin for
Figure 3. Reusability of the whole-cell biocatalyst using pNPA as a
substrate. Experiments were conducted in triplicate, and data shown
are mean values (±standard deviation). Enzyme activity from fresh,
non-reused cells was taken as 100%. Statistical significance was

directed co-assembly of PET-degrading enzymes for efficient
PET depolymerization. Co-immobilization of FAST-PETase
and MHETase on a surface-displayed trifunctional scaffoldin
led to complete depolymerization of PET into its constituent
monomers TPA and EG, with no accumulation of reaction
intermediates. In our system, the presence of MHETase along
with FAST-PETase led to a nearly 5-fold boost in product
formation, and attachment of FAST-PETase at two sites on the
trifunctional scaffoldin further boosted yields by up to 1.8-fold.
TPA yields of 4.95 mM were obtained in 7 days on an
amorphous PET film with no pretreatment requirement.
Whole-cell activity was retained over at least six reusability
cycles.
Produced environmentally benign monomers TPA and EG
can be reused by chemical and biological methods. They can
be used to regenerate virgin PET, enabling closed-loop PET
recycling.
12
Given the high purity of the reaction supernatant
after depolymerization, the constituent monomers can be
potentially directly utilized without additional separation and
purification steps. Furthermore, the whole-cell biocatalyst can
also be easily separated by centrifugation on a small scale or by
sedimentation, filtration, and decantation on a large scale.
16
Monomers TPA and EG can be upcycled into value-added
products like the biodegradable plastic polyhydroxyalkanoate
(PHA)
36,37
or intermediates like protocatechuic acid (PCA),
gallic acid (GA),
38
and lycopene,
2
which serve as precursors
for many industrially valuable products. This upcycling can be
done using a single strain
2
or a microbial community of
biocatalysts.
37
Alternatively, the whole-cell catalyst can be
integrated with existing chemo-bioprocesses for one-pot PET
upcycling.
39
This biocatalyst system has the unique potential to
be used as a biotransformation platform to recycle and upcycle
PET waste, since the use of divergent cohesin−dockerin pairs
can facilitate directed assembly of multiple enzyme cascades on
the cell surface.
40
The whole-cell biocatalyst can also be used
to degrade microplastics in wastewater effluents.
16
Thus, this
PET depolymerization approach could pave the way for a
circular plastic economy.
