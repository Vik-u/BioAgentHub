Accumulation of plastics in the oceans presents a major threat to diverse ecosystems.
The introduction of biodegradable plastics into the market aims to alleviate the ecological
burden caused by recalcitrant plastics. Poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT)
is a biodegradable commercial plastic that can be biodegraded similarly to polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) by PETase-like enzymes and MHETases. The role of MHETases
is to hydrolyze the intermediate degradation product of PET, mono-2-hydroxyethyl
terephthalate (MHET) to its monomers. We recently identiﬁed a homolog of the
MHETase of the PET-degrading bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis, Mle046, from a marine
microbial consortium. In this consortium, Mle046 was highly expressed when a
PBAT-based blend ﬁlm (PF) was supplied as the sole carbon source. In this study,
we recombinantly expressed and biochemically characterized Mle046 under different
conditions. Mle046 degrades MHET but also 4-(4-hydroxybutoxycarbonyl) benzoic acid
(Bte), the intermediate of PF degradation. Mle046 is a mesophilic enzyme adapted to
marine conditions, which rapidly degrades MHET to terephthalate and ethylene glycol
at temperatures between 20 and 40 ◦C. Mle046 degradation rates were similar for Bte
and MHET. Despite its mesophilic tendency, Mle046 retains a considerable amount of
activity at temperatures ranging from 10 to 60◦C. In addition, Mle046 is active at a range
of pH values from 6.5 to 9. These characteristics make Mle046 a promising candidate
for biotechnological applications related to plastic recycling.

INTRODUCTION
Biodegradable plastics were introduced in the 1980s into the market as an ecologically friendlier
substitute to non-biodegradable plastics (Chen, 2009). Most of these biodegradable plastics
contain ester bonds that are prone to enzymatic hydrolysis. One of these biodegradable plastics
is the copolymer poly (butylene adipate-co-terephthalate (PBAT), composed of the monomers
terephthalic acid (Te), adipic acid, and 1, 4-butanediol (B). The combination of aliphatic and
aromatic units in PBAT oﬀers better physical properties than aliphatic–aliphatic biodegradable
plastics (Jian et al., 2020). Their chemical structure gives them ﬂexibility and strength similar to
low-density polyethylene plastic (Jian et al., 2020). In contrast to polyethylene, however, PBAT
is susceptible to microbial degradation in compost and soils (Witt et al., 1999; Zumstein et al.,
2018). PBAT biodegradability and high performance make it suitable for packing ﬁlms. This makes
them more economically attractive than other biodegradable plastics (Ferreira et al., 2019). As

Meyer-Cifuentes and Öztürk Marine MHETase-Like Enzyme Mle046
already mentioned, PBAT-based plastics can be biodegraded
easily in compost by microorganisms (Witt et al., 1995,
1996, 2001). Their fate and biodegradability in aquatic natural
environments, however, are still poorly understood. In a previous
study, we revealed that a synergistic mechanism within a marine
consortium was necessary to achieve complete mineralization
of a PBAT-based polymer blend (PF) (Meyer-Cifuentes et al.,
2020). In that study, several putative PETase-like (Ple) and
MHETase-like (Mle) hydrolases as well as terephthalic acid
degrading genes (TPD) were found in the metagenome. We
proposed then the following mechanism for PF biodegradation:
Ples hydrolyze the ester bonds of the polymeric PF , yielding
the monoester 4-(4-hydroxybutoxycarbonyl) benzoic acid (Bte)
and other oligomers. Bte can be further degraded by highly
speciﬁc esterases, namely, Mles ( Figure 1 ). In this respect,
the suggested biodegradation mechanism for PF is similar
to that of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) degradation by
Ideonella sakaiensis (Yoshida et al., 2016). Degradation of
PET by this bacterium is initiated by IsPETase to yield
the monoester mono-2-hydroxyethyl terephthalate (MHET),
the ﬁrst intermediate of PET degradation. MHET is then
further hydrolyzed by α/β-hydrolase, IsMHETase, to Te and
ethylene glycol. I. sakaiensis can further degrade Te via a
TPD cluster. Among the diﬀerent Mles identiﬁed in our
previous study (Meyer-Cifuentes et al., 2020), only Mle046,
presumably produced by an Alphaproteobacterial strain, was
consistently expressed and produced during PF degradation. This
mle046 is 100% identical to a homolog present in Celeribacter
manganoxidans and its protein is 46.9% identical to IsMHETase.
At the structural level, Mle046 contains a domain typical of
feruloyl esterases compromising the canonical catalytic triad of
these types of enzymes. The high expression in the presence
of PF and its similarity to IsMHETase suggests that Mle046
is responsible for the PF degradation intermediate Bte and
can also degrade the structurally similar PET degradation
intermediate MHET.
In this study, we investigate the biochemical characteristics
of a new MHETase-like enzyme, Mle046. Speciﬁcally, we
demonstrate the ability of Mle046 to hydrolyze MHET, Bte under
broad temperature and pH conditions. This novel MHETase-
like enzyme could potentially be engineered in the near future
to degrade plastics and produced plastic monomers in two-
enzyme reactor systems as shown before (Barth et al., 2015;
Knott et al., 2020).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Gene Synthesis
Codon-optimized gene mle046 was synthesized by BioCat GmbH
(Heidelberg, Germany) and cloned into a pColdII vector. The
codon-optimized sequence can be found in Supplementary
Table 1 . The signal peptide (ﬁrst 27 amino acids) of the
original protein was detected with the SignalP software v. 5.0
(Almagro Armenteros et al., 2019) and was excluded from the
synthetic construct.
Expression of the Mle046 and Cell Lysis
The Mle046 was expressed following a protocol adapted from
Palm et al. (2019). Escherichia coli Shuﬄe T7 cells (New England
BioLabs, United States) were transformed with the pColdII
plasmid containing the mle046 insert. The transformants were
plated on Lysogeny Broth (LB) agar plates with 50 mg/L of
ampicillin and incubated at 37 ◦C overnight. Pre-cultures were
prepared by inoculating single colonies from the plates to
liquid LB and incubated for 62 h at 20 ◦C, 150 rpm. After
this time, 1 mL of the pre-culture was inoculated to 200 mL
of Terriﬁc Broth containing 100 mg/L Carbenicillin (Sigma-
Aldrich, United States) in 1 L baﬄed ﬂasks. The cultures were
incubated at 37 ◦C at 150 rpm in a MaxQ TM 4000 orbital shaker
(Fischer Scientiﬁc, Germany), until an OD 600 nm of 0.8–1.0 was
reached. Then 0.5 mM of IPTG was added to cultures pre-
cooled on ice for 15 min. Cultures were incubated overnight
at 15 ◦C, 150 rpm. After incubation, the pellets were collected
by centrifuging at 4 ◦C, 5,514 × g for 10 min in a Heraeus TM
MultifugeTM X3 (Fischer Scientiﬁc, Germany), and resuspended
in His-Tag binding buﬀer (20 mM sodium phosphate and 0.5 M
NaCl, pH 7.4) at 1:10 of the original culture volume. Cells were
disrupted by incubation with FastBreak TM Cell Lysis Reagent
(Promega, United States) and 1 µL PierceTM Universal Nuclease
for Cell Lysis (Thermo Fischer Scientiﬁc, United States) at
20◦C for 30 min with constant shaking in a MaxQ TM 4000
orbital shaker (Fischer Scientiﬁc, Germany). To separate and
collect the soluble fraction, the lysates were centrifuged at 4 ◦C,
15,000 × g for 30 min in a Heraeus TM MultifugeTM X3 (Fischer
Scientiﬁc, Germany). The soluble fractions were ﬁltered through
a 0.2 µM ﬁlter.
Identiﬁcation and Puriﬁcation of the
Mle046
Ten microliters of soluble fractions of induced and non-induced
cells were mixed with 10 µL of 2 × sodium dodecyl sulphate–
polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) Protein loading
buﬀer and boiled for 10 min at 95 ◦C in an Eppendorf
Thermomixer
R⃝ C (Eppendorf, Germany). Insoluble fractions
from the same experiments were resuspended in PBS and
treated the same way as the soluble fractions as a control for
denatured proteins or inclusion bodies. After cooling on ice,
the samples were loaded into 12% SDS-PAGE gels and ran for
45 min at 25 V/cm in a Mini-PROTEAN
R⃝ Tetra Cell (Bio-
Rad Laboratories, United States). The presence of Mle046 was
detected by comparing induced to non-induced samples and
to a protein size standard (Precision Plus Protein TM Unstained
Standards, Bio-Rad Laboratories, United States). As the protein
was detected in the soluble fraction, insoluble fractions were not
used for further experiments.
The soluble induced fractions were loaded into a 5 mL His-
TrapTM HP aﬃnity Ni-Sepharose column (Cytiva, Germany)
connected to an ÄKTA TM Start Puriﬁcation System (Cytiva,
Germany). Proteins were bound and eluted from the column
by using the predeﬁned aﬃnity puriﬁcation protocol included
in the UNICORN
R⃝ start 1.1 software (Cytiva, Germany). The
purity of the fractions presenting a peak was assessed as described

terephthalate-butanediol monoester (Bte) that yields Te and B. Te is further degraded by a Te degradation cluster (TPD). Downstream degrading enzymes lead to the

before by SDS-PAGE. The fractions were further concentrated
on a PierceTM Protein Concentrator PES 10K MWCO (Thermo
Fischer Scientiﬁc, United States). The aﬃnity-puriﬁed fractions
were further polished by size exclusion chromatography on
a HiPrep TM 16/60 Sephacryl TM S-200 HR column (Cytiva,
Germany) connected to an ÄKTA TM Start Puriﬁcation System
(Cytiva, Germany) in a buﬀer consisting of 25 mM Tris–HCl
and 200 mM NaCl, pH 7.5. Fractions containing the Mle046
protein were pooled and concentrated on a Pierce TM Protein
Concentrator PES 10K MWCO (Thermo Fischer Scientiﬁc,
United States). The concentration of the puriﬁed protein was
quantiﬁed by using the Qubit Protein Assay kit and measured on
a Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Invitrogen, United States).
Hydrolysis of MHET by Mle046
To assay the hydrolysis of MHET by Mle046, the activity of
the enzyme was measured in triplicate as described before
(Palm et al., 2019) with a few modiﬁcations. Mle046 was
used at a ﬁnal concentration of 0.002 µg/µL and incubated
in the presence of diﬀerent concentrations of MHET (300–
2,700 µM) dissolved in 40 mM sodium phosphate buﬀer,
pH 7.5. Incubations were carried out for 21 min at 30 ◦C
and shaking at 300 rpm in an Eppendorf Thermomixer
R⃝
C (Eppendorf, Germany). Every 3 min a sample was taken
and immediately inactivated by adding an equal volume
of methanol (Methanol Optigrade ® for HPLC, Promochem,
LGC Standards GmbH, Germany). The samples were then
centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 10 min in a Microstar 17R
centrifuge (VWR, United States) and the supernatants were
transferred to standard HPLC vials. Negative controls containing
only the substrate and buﬀer were also included. MHET
degradation was detected with a 1260 Inﬁnity II LC System
(Agilent Technologies, United States). Samples were separated
through a Agilent Poroshell 120 HPH-C18 column (Agilent
Technologies, United States) with a gradient of acetonitrile 99.9%
HPLC grade (Fischer Scientiﬁc, United States) and 0.1% (v/v)
formic acid (98–100% Suprapur
R⃝, Sigma-Aldrich, United States)
in Milli-Q water. The ﬂow rate was set at 0.2 mL/min.
One microliter of the sample was injected. Acetonitrile was
increased from 5 to 44% until minute 12 and then to 70% at
minute 15 remaining constant for other 3 min. MHET was
detected at 240 nm.
Determination of Enzyme Kinetics
Mle046 rates were plotted against MHET concentrations, and
the kinetic parameters were determined by using the GraphPad
Prism v. 5. 01 software (GraphPad). Kinetics parameters such
as maximum velocity ( Vmax), Michaelis–Menten constant
(Km), and the rate constant ( kcat) were calculated with non-
linear regression.

Meyer-Cifuentes and Öztürk Marine MHETase-Like Enzyme Mle046
Hydrolysis of Bte by Mle046 and
Substrate Afﬁnity
To assess Mle046 activity on the PF degradation intermediate,
Bte, 0.002 µg/µL of the enzyme was incubated in 40 mM sodium
phosphate buﬀer, pH 7.5 in the presence of 1,000 µM of Bte (Bte
was synthetized as indicated in the Supplementary Material ).
Negative controls containing only the substrate and buﬀer were
also included. Reactions and controls were prepared in triplicates
and incubated at 30 ◦C, 21 min, and shaking at 300 rpm in
an Eppendorf Thermomixer
R⃝ C (Eppendorf, Germany). Every
3 min a sample was taken and immediately inactivated by
adding an equal volume of methanol (Methanol Optigrade ®
for HPLC, Promochem, LGC Standards GmbH, Germany). The
samples were then centrifuged at 17,000 × g for 10 min in
a Microstar 17R centrifuge (VWR, United States), and the
supernatants were transferred to standard HPLC vials. MHET
degradation was detected with a 1260 Inﬁnity II LC System
(Agilent Technologies, United States). Samples were separated
through an Agilent Poroshell 120 HPH-C18 column (Agilent
Technologies, United States) with a gradient of acetonitrile 99.9%
HPLC grade (Fischer Scientiﬁc, United States) and 0.1% (v/v)
formic acid (98–100% Suprapur
R⃝, Sigma-Aldrich, United States)
in Milli-Q water. The ﬂow rate was set at 0.2 mL/min. One
microliter of the sample was injected. Acetonitrile was increased
from 5 to 44% until minute 12 and then to 70% at minute 15
remaining constant for other 3 min. Bte and Te formation was
detected at 240 nm.
Additionally, we tested substrate range of Mle046 by
incubating the enzyme in the presence of a mixture of Bte and
BHET (bis 2-hydroxyethyl terephthalate, the precursor to MHET
during PET degradation), only with Bte or only with BHET.
For this, 1 µL Mle046 (0.005 µg/µL) was incubated in 40 mM
sodium phosphate buﬀer, pH 7.5 with the following substrates:
800 µM of BHET, 800 µM of Bte, and a mixture of 800 µM of
BHET and 800 µM Bte. Negative controls containing only the
substrate and buﬀer were also included. Reactions and controls
were prepared in triplicates and incubated at 20 ◦C for 30 min in
an Eppendorf ThermoMixer
R⃝ C (Eppendorf, Germany). Three
sampling points were taken at 0, 15, and 30 min. The samples
were immediately inactivated after the addition of acidic (pH 2.5)
160 mM sodium phosphate buﬀer (Palm et al., 2019) and heating
at 80◦C for 10 min. Bte and BHET were further detected with a
1260 Inﬁnity II LC System (Agilent Technologies, United States).
Samples were separated through an Agilent Poroshell 120 HPH-
C18 column (Agilent Technologies, United States). The mobile
phase consisted of a gradient of acetonitrile 99.9% HPLC grade
(Fischer Scientiﬁc, United States) and 0.1% (v/v) of formic acid
(98–100% Suprapur
R⃝, Sigma-Aldrich, United States) in Milli-Q
water. The ﬂow rate was set at 0.2 mL/min. One microliter of the
sample was injected. Acetonitrile was increased from 5 to 44%
until minute 12 and then to 70% at minute 15 remaining constant
for other 3 min. BHET and Bte were detected at 240 nm.
Determination of Optimum pH and
Temperature
We tested Mle046 activity at diﬀerent temperatures and pH
values by measuring the formation of Te after degradation of
MHET at diﬀerent pH and temperatures. For the reaction,
Mle046 (0.002 µg/µL) was incubated in 100 mM sodium
phosphate buﬀer pH 7.5 with 800 µM MHET. Negative controls
containing only the substrate and buﬀer were also included.
Reactions and controls were prepared in triplicates. Incubations
were performed in a Veriti TM 96-Well Thermal cycler (Applied
Biosystems, United States) between 5 and 10–60 ◦C with a
10◦C increments. After 20 min, the reactions were immediately
inactivated by adding an equal volume of methanol (Methanol
Optigrade® for HPLC, Promochem, LGC Standards GmbH,
Germany). The samples were then centrifuged at 17,000 × g
for 10 min in a Microstar 17R centrifuge (VWR, United States),
and the supernatants were transferred to standard HPLC vials.
To test the eﬀect of diﬀerent pH values on Mle046 activity, we
incubated the enzyme with 800 µM MHET as the substrate
in 100 mM sodium phosphate buﬀer. The pH of the buﬀer
was adjusted between 5 and 10 with 1 pH unit increments.
Negative controls containing only the substrate and buﬀer were
also included. Reactions and controls were prepared in triplicates
and incubated at 20 ◦C in a Veriti TM 96-Well Thermal cycler
(Applied Biosystems, United States). After 20 min, the reactions
were immediately inactivated by adding an equal volume of
methanol (Methanol Optigrade ® for HPLC, Promochem, LGC
Standards GmbH, Germany). The samples were then centrifuged
at 17,000 × g for 10 min in a Microstar 17R centrifuge
(VWR, United States), and the supernatants were transferred to
standard HPLC vials.
Temperature and pH optimum were assessed by measuring
Te formation with a 1260 Inﬁnity II LC System (Agilent
Technologies, United States). Samples were separated through an
Agilent Poroshell 120 HPH-C18 column (Agilent Technologies,
United States) with a gradient of acetonitrile 99.9% HPLC grade
(Fischer Scientiﬁc, United States) and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid
(98–100% Suprapur
R⃝, Sigma-Aldrich, United States) in Milli-Q
water. The ﬂow rate was set at 0.2 mL/min. One microliter of the
sample was injected. Acetonitrile was increased from 5 to 44%
until minute 12 and then to 70% at minute 15 remaining constant
for other 3 min. MHET and Te formation was detected at 240 nm.
Product Inhibition
The inhibition of Mle046 activity in the presence of the products
Te (12,500, 10,000, 7,500, 5,000, and 2,500 µM) and 1,4-
butanediol (B) (100,000, 200,000, and 450,000 µM) was tested.
For this assay, the Te or B was diluted in 100 mM sodium
phosphate buﬀer pH 7.5 in the presence of 1,000 µM of
MpNPT (MpNPT was synthesized according to Palm et al.,
2019) and 0.02 µg/µL of Mle046. Incubations were performed in
triplicate at 20◦C, in a VeritiTM 96-Well Thermal cycler (Applied
Biosystems, United States). Negative controls consisting of only
the substrate and buﬀer were included together with positive
controls consisting of the substrate, the buﬀer, and Mle046
without an inhibitory product.
The absorbance of the samples was measured after 30 min of
incubation at 450 nm in a TECAN Inﬁnite
R⃝ M200 plate reader
(TECAN, Switzerland) and retrieved using the TECAN i-control
v. 1.5.14.0 software (TECAN, Switzerland). The concentration of
the produced 4-nitrophenol was obtained from a 4-nitrophenol
standard curve prepared under the same assay conditions.

protein agrees with the predicted size (62 kD).
RESULTS
Mle046 Puriﬁcation and Identiﬁcation
The Mle046 sequence obtained in a previous study (Meyer-
Cifuentes et al., 2020) was used in this study and codon
optimized for recombinant expression. The theoretical size
of the His-tagged Mle046 is 62 kD. Structural analysis of
the Mle046 sequence and its similarity to other MHETase-
like enzymes were described in more detail previously
(Meyer-Cifuentes et al., 2020).
The Mle046 protein was puriﬁed by aﬃnity chromatography
to determine degradation kinetics, substrate speciﬁcity,
inhibition, and optimized conditions. The size of the puriﬁed
Mle046 on an SDS-PAGE gel was similar to the expected
size. The purest fraction was used in this study ( Figure 2 ).
The concentration and calculated yield of Mle046 after
puriﬁcation were 4 mg/mL and 60 mg of protein per 1 L of cell
culture, respectively.
Mle046 Activity Toward MHET and Bte
Mle046 (0.002 µg/µL; 0.04 µM) can degrade MHET to
concentrations up to 2,200 µM at 30 ◦C. The highest rate was
1.4 µMs−1 with 1,570 µM of MHET. With 2,700 µM MHET,
the rate of degradation declined to 0.47 µMs−1. As shown in
FIGURE 3 | Rate of MHET catalysis by Mle046 plotted against substrate
concentration. Degradation rates are expressed in terms of µM MHET
degraded per second. Error bars indicate standard deviation (n = 3).

different pH values. Error bars indicate standard deviation (n = 3).
Figure 3 , Mle046 kinetics followed a Michaelis–Menten curve
with concentrations up to 2,230 µM. Mle046 Vmax, Km, and
the rate constant kcat were estimated as 2.9 µMs−1, 2,638 µM
(±797), and 80.9 s −1 (±15.8), respectively ( Supplementary
Table 2). The reaction eﬃciency of Mle046, kcat/Km, was 0.03.
After 21 min of incubation, Mle046 degraded 92% of 800 µM of
MHET relative to the ﬁrst sampling point. On the contrary, when
2,700 µM of MHET was present, the Mle046 could be degraded
only ∼10% of MHET. We also tested the activity of Mle046 on
the ﬁrst intermediate of PF degradation, Bte. The incubation of
Mle046 (0.002 µg/µL) in the presence of 1,000 µM Bte led to
94% Bte degradation after 21 min ( Supplementary Figure 1 ).
The degradation rate with 1,000 µM of Bte, 0.82 µMs−1, was
almost the same as the degradation rate of Mle046 incubated
with 1,140 µM MHET, 0.78 µMs−1. After 21 min of incubation
with 1,000 µM of Bte with Mle046, 861 µM of Te was formed.
When Mle046 (0.005 µg/µL) was incubated with 800 µM
Bte, 800 µM of BHET, or a mixture of both substrates, the
degradation rate of Bte remained the same (0.62 ± 0.03 µMs−1)
with either of the substrates or in combination. Whether
Bte was supplied alone or together with BHET, more than
70% of the initial amount of Bte was degraded after 15 min
(Figure 4 ). This suggests that BHET has no inhibitory eﬀect
over Bte degradation. At the same time, Mle046 had no activity
toward BHET.
Dependence of Mle046 Activity on
Temperature and pH
Mle046 degraded MHET and produced Te at every temperature
tested. At 20, 30, and 40 ◦C, after 20 min of incubation, Mle046
released similar amounts of Te 644, 656, and 648µM, respectively
(Figure 5A). The released amount of Te decreased relative to the
amount formed at 30◦C; to 51% at 5◦C, 60% at 10◦C, 24% at 50◦C,
and 10% at 60 ◦C. Mle046 formed the same amount of Te (98%)
at 20 and 40◦C.
We also analyzed the eﬀect of pH on MHET degradation
by the Mle046. Similar to the Mle046 activity at diﬀerent
temperatures, MHET was degraded in a broad range of pH
conditions. As observed in this study, the activity of Mle046
was mostly aﬀected by highly acidic (pH 5) or alkaline (pH 10)
conditions (Figure 5B). The highest amount of Te was formed
at pH 8 and 9 (839 ± 15 µM). Relative to the condition at pH
8, Te formation decreased to 8% at pH 5 and less than 30% at
pH 10. Thus, the optimum pH of the enzyme activity is within

To test product inhibition, we incubated Mle046 at 20 ◦C in
the co-presence of MpNPT and Bte degradation products:

Meyer-Cifuentes and Öztürk Marine MHETase-Like Enzyme Mle046
Te or B. The activity was then assessed by measuring the
formation of 1,4-nitrophenol. Under these conditions, we
observe that high concentrations of Te had a negative eﬀect
on the degradation of MpNPT by Mle046 ( Figure 6 ). When
we incubated Mle046 in the presence of Te concentrations of
≥7,500 µM, less than 50% of 4-nitrophenol was formed (relative
to Mle046 without Te). With lower concentrations (<5,000 µM),
Mle046 produced the same amount of 4-nitrophenol as when
Mle046 was incubated in the absence of Te or B. In the
presence of 2,500 µM of Te, Mle046 formed 530 µM of 4-
nitrophenol similarly to the 570 µM 4-nitrophenol formed in
the absence of Te. This means that with 2,500 µM of Te,
the degradation rate was reduced only by 7%. Contrary to
Te, none of the B concentrations tested in this study had a
negative eﬀect on the formation of 4-nitrophenol by Mle046
(data not shown).
DISCUSSION
In this study, we expressed, puriﬁed, and biochemically
characterized an MHETase-like enzyme, Mle046, identiﬁed
previously in a marine microbial consortium (Meyer-Cifuentes
et al., 2020). To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst
identiﬁed and characterized marine MHETase-like enzyme.
We show that Mle046 degrades not only the ﬁrst intermediate
of PF degradation, Bte, but also the ﬁrst intermediate of PET
degradation, MHET. Mle046 can degrade MHET over a wide
range of concentrations at 30 ◦C. Its Km is, however, high
(2,638 µM ± 797) when compared to those of IsMHETase
(7.3 ± 0.6 µM) (Palm et al., 2019) and IsMHETase homologs
of Comamonas thiooxydans and Hydrogenophaga sp. PML113
(174.70 ± 4.75 and 41.09 ± 3.38 µM, respectively) (Knott et al.,
2020). This implies that Mle046 has a lower aﬃnity to MHET
and that the enzyme does not accept MHET as eﬃciently as
the previously described homologs. However, enzymes which
catalyze the same reaction but are from diﬀerent organisms can
have widely diﬀering Km values (Robinson, 2015). As already
suggested by Palm et al. (2019), low substrate aﬃnity can
be a disadvantage for bacteria in natural environments where
low substrate concentrations are expected. The turnover rate
(kcat) of MHET by Mle046 was, however, much higher than
those that were reported for other MHETases. The turnover of
the IsMHETase calculated in diﬀerent studies ranges between
11.1 and 31 s −1 (Yoshida et al., 2016; Palm et al., 2019;
Knott et al., 2020), while the turnover of Hydrogenophaga
sp. PML113 and C. thiooxydans MHETases is 3.8 ± 2.5 and
9.5 ± 0.8 s −1, respectively (Knott et al., 2020). Due to the
higher km value, the catalytic eﬃciency of Mle046 (0.03) is
∼40 times lower than that of IsMHETase but in the same
order of magnitude as the Hydrogenophaga sp. PML113 and
C. thiooxydans MHETases (Knott et al., 2020). Knott et al. (2020)
demonstrated that an S131G mutant of the IsMHETase had a
lower aﬃnity to MHET and a much higher Km than the wild
type. The position 131 is a glycine in the Mle046 (Gly117),
as it is in the two homologs in Hydrogenophaga sp. PML113
and C. thiooxydans (Supplementary Figure 2 ). We therefore
suggest that this residue is a determining factor for the substrate
aﬃnity of Mle046.
We also investigated if Mle046 is subjected to product
inhibition, similar to IsMHETase, its homologs and other feruloic
acid esterases (Crepin et al., 2003; Knott et al., 2020). We did not
observe a strong inhibition of Mle046 by Te, one of the products
of MHET and Bte degradation. Palm et al. (2019) proposed
that substrate recognition by IsMHETase strongly relies on the
aromatic ring of the substrate and that, therefore, Te might bind
and inhibit the IsMHETase. Knott et al. (2020) suggested that
the aforementioned S131G mutation reduces inhibition due to
the reduced aﬃnity of the enzyme to the substrate, which may
explain the lack of Te inhibition for Mle046 as well. In the context
of plastic degradation in the natural environment, Te inhibition
would be less limiting, since this product is rapidly metabolized
(Meyer-Cifuentes et al., 2020).
IsMHETase and some homologs such at TfCa from
Thermobiﬁda fusca present activity toward BHET (Belisário-
Ferrari et al., 2019; Sagong et al., 2020). Yet, when Mle046 was
incubated with Bte and BHET, Mle046 could not degrade BHET.
In addition, the presence of this substrate did not inhibit Mle046
activity toward Bte. High speciﬁcity of Mle046 toward MHET
might be beneﬁcial in dual-enzyme systems designed to degrade
plastics with a mixture of PETases and MHETases enzymes
(Knott et al., 2020).
We also found that Mle046 is active at low temperatures,
retaining ∼50% of its activity at 5 ◦C compared to 30 ◦C.
We conclude that Mle046 is a mesophilic but cold-active
enzyme, rather than a psychrophilic enzyme. At higher
temperatures ( >40◦C), however, we observed a decline
in Mle046 activity which indicates that Mle046 is heat-
labile to a certain degree but not completely inactivated,
retaining some of its activity at temperatures up to 60 ◦C.
The mesophilic and cold-active tendency of Mle046 is likely
associated with the marine nature of the Mle046-producing
bacteria were collected from. Mle046 originates from a mixed
culture that was enriched using inocula collected from the
North, Aegean, and Tyrrehenian seas. Overall, the surface
temperatures of these areas range between 15 and 25 ◦C yearly.
Previously, we have shown that Mle046 was acquired via a
transposable element from an Alphaproteobacterial conjugative
plasmid, pDY25-B. Within this group, C. manganoxidans
and Sulﬁtobacter sp. HI0023 contain the pDY25-B plasmid
with the incorporated mle046 sequence. Celeribacter species
have been commonly isolated either from coastal surface
seawater or deep-sea sediments (Lee et al., 2012; Baek et al.,
2014; Lai et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2015). Like Celeribacter
species, Sulﬁtobacter sp. HI0023 was isolated from the
Paciﬁc Ocean (Sosa et al., 2015). These ﬁndings strongly
indicate that Mle046 contained in the pDY25-B plasmid
evolved and adapted together with its hosts to mild-to-cold
temperatures in the oceans.
Mle046 remains active at temperatures above 30 ◦C and up to
60◦C albeit at lower degradation rates. The activity of IsMHETase
on the other hand rapidly falls at temperatures above 45 ◦C and

Meyer-Cifuentes and Öztürk Marine MHETase-Like Enzyme Mle046
at 60 ◦C the enzyme is virtually inactivate (Palm et al., 2019).
Thus, Mle046 is an enzyme that can be used in two-enzyme
degradation systems where high temperatures, typically around
60◦C, are needed for more eﬃcient PET degradation (Barth
et al., 2015; De Castro et al., 2017; Wei and Zimmermann, 2017;
Samak et al., 2020). In these systems, the PETases and MHETase-
like enzymes can be additionally engineered to improve their
hydrolytic properties (Austin et al., 2018; Ma et al., 2018; Son
et al., 2019, 2020; Knott et al., 2020).
We conclude that Mle046 is a marine MHETase
which can degrade the degradation intermediates of both
PET and PBAT. With its activity at a broad range of
temperatures and pH values, it is a contender as an
enzyme to complement PETase activity in dual-enzyme
systems for biotechnological applications. Engineering of
the active site can improve the catalytic eﬃciency and
substrate aﬃnity.
