Efficient Degradation of 
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) 
with Thermobifida fusca Cutinase 
Exhibiting Improved Catalytic 
Activity Generated using 
Mutagenesis and Additive-based 
Approaches

Cutinases are promising agents for poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) bio-recycling because of 
their ability to produce the PET monomer terephthalic acid with high efficiency under mild reaction 
conditions. In this study, we found that the low-crystallinity PET (lcPET) hydrolysis activity of 
thermostable cutinase from Thermobifida fusca (TfCut2), was increased by the addition of cationic 
surfactant that attracts enzymes near the lcPET film surface via electrostatic interactions. This approach 
was applicable to the mutant TfCut2 G62A/F209A, which was designed based on a sequence comparison 
with PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis. As a result, the degradation rate of the mutant in the presence 
of cationic surfactant increased to 31 ± 0.1 nmol min
−1 cm−2, 12.7 times higher than that of wild-type 
TfCut2 in the absence of surfactant. The long-duration reaction showed that lcPET film (200 μm) was 
97 ± 1.8% within 30 h, the fastest biodegradation rate of lcPET film thus far. We therefore believe that 
our approach would expand the possibility of enzyme utilization in industrial PET biodegradation.
The environmentally friendly enzymatic degradation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is of great importance 
for implementing sustainable development 1,2. In addition to safe and mild reaction conditions, the enzymatic 
hydrolysis of PET gives the monomers terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG), which aid efficient 
recovery
3,4. The enzymatic degradation of PET is typically conducted by cutinases, which can hydrolyze cutin 
and various polyesters such as PET at temperatures of 40 °C–70 °C and pH 7–9, without the need for cofactors5–8. 
A number of thermostable cutinases such as Humicola insolens cutinase (HiC), Thermobifida fusca  cutinase 
(TfCut2), and leaf-branch compost cutinase (LCC) conduct hydrolyses efficiently7–9. We previously identified a 
mesophilic PET-specific hydrolase (PETase) with 24–51% sequence similarity to the above cutinases (Fig. 1a)10–12. 
This PETase was isolated from the PET-assimilating bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis  and has attracted attention 
for its potential practical applications13–18. Indeed, this PETase has been genetically modified by various research 
groups to generate mutant enzymes with improved catalytic activity and thermostability 17–20. We recently 
reported an alternative approach to mutagenesis for improving PETase activity involving the pre-incubation of 
anionic surfactants with low crystallinity PET film prior to the addition of PETase
21. The surfactant facilitates 
contact between the cationic PETase with the hydrophobic PET substrate, resulting in a 120-fold improvement 
in catalytic activity (Fig. 1a,b). A long-duration reaction experiment showed that this modified PETase degrades 
18% of the PET film (200 µm thick, NOACRYSTAL-V) in 24 h in the presence of surfactant. Nonetheless, the 
catalytic activity of PETase remains lower than that of cutinases. For example, wild-type HiC, engineered TfCut2

(G62A), and wild-type LCC degraded 24%, 20%, and 48% low crystallinity PET (250 µm thick, Goodfellow, prod-
uct number: ES301445), respectively, after 24 h at 65 °C–70 °C, based on weight loss7,22,23. Furthermore, cutinases 
remain active for over 24 h under reaction conditions, whereas PETase activity in the presence of surfactant 
gradually decreases as the reaction period is extended, with a 36-h reaction resulting in only 4% additional weight 
loss compared with 24 h, for a total weight loss of 22% in 36 h. This decrease in reactivity is likely due to the low 
stability of PETase (Tm = 46.8 °C) that also limits its use at higher temperatures approaching the glass transition 
temperature of PET16. We therefore speculated that applying our previous additive-based approach to more sta-
ble cutinases would improve the degradation rate. In this study, we attempted to improve the catalytic activity 
of TfCut2 due to its high sequence similarity with PETase (51%) as compared with HiC (24%) or LCC (49%) 
(Fig. 1c). In addition, wild-type and mutant TfCut2 can be easily expressed and purified using typical Escherichia 
coli expression systems
24.
In contrast to the PETase surface charge (isoelectric point (pI) = 9.4), TfCut2 has a negatively charged surface 
(pI = 6.1) and we thus anticipated that positively charged cationic surfactants would accelerate the TfCut2 cata-
lytic reaction (Fig. 1c,d). Here, we report the effects of a series of cationic surfactants (alkyl trimethyl ammonium 
chloride with different alkyl-chain lengths, Cn-N(CH3)3
+) on TfCut2-catalyzed PET hydrolysis at various reaction 
temperatures (40 °C–70 °C). A mutant TfCut2 was also designed to further improve catalytic activity (Fig. 1e).

Results and Discussions
Effects of surfactants on TfCut2 activity.  We initially confirmed the effect of cationic surfactants on 
wild-type TfCut2 catalytic activity at 40 °C. A single low crystallinity PET (lcPET) film (3–5% crystallinity, 0.6 cm 
diameter, 200 µm thick) was incubated with 250 ppm dodecyl trimethyl ammonium (C12-N(CH3)3
+) for 1 h prior 
to the addition of TfCut2 (1 µM final concentration). The surfactant concentration at this stage was determined 
from previous experiments using PETase21. After a 3-h reaction, the products, bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate 
(BHET), mono(hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) and TPA, were quantified by HPLC analysis. The cationic 
surfactant accelerated the reaction rate 13-fold faster than in the absence of surfactant (Fig.  2). We also moni-
tored the reaction in the presence of 250 ppm of the anionic surfactant dodecyl sulfate (C 12-OSO3
−). Although 
we previously showed that the hydrolysis reaction was inhibited if the reaction was performed with surfactants 
carrying the same charge as the enzyme surface
21, C12-OSO3
− improved TfCut2 activity 4.3-fold, perhaps because 
the cationic regions at the protein surface (blue areas in Fig. 1c) interact with the anionic surfactant.
Based on these results, we judged that cationic surfactants would be better mediators for the interaction of 
TfCut2 with the lcPET surface and we thus optimized the reaction conditions (reaction temperature, alkyl chain 
length of the cationic surfactants, and surfactant concentrations; Fig. S1 and Table S1). Figure 3a shows the high-
est catalytic activities obtained at different temperatures under optimized reaction conditions. The surfactants 
drastically accelerated the hydrolysis reaction at all temperatures. The maximum activity of 6.0 ± 0.3 nmol min
−1 
cm−2 was observed in the presence of 30 ppm C12-N(CH3)3
+ at 65 °C. In contrast, no acceleration effect of cationic 
surfactant was observed in the hydrolysis reaction of the soluble model substrate p-nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB) 
(Fig. S2), indicating that the surfactant molecule does not affect the enzymatic hydrolysis reaction process. 
Interestingly, as the reaction temperature was raised, lower concentrations of surfactants with shorter alkyl chains 
effectively accelerated the catalytic reaction (Fig. S1 and Table S1), suggesting that hydrophobic interactions 
between the alkyl chains of the surfactants and the PET film surface were facilitated by elevating the temperature.
We next investigated the amount of adsorbed enzyme on lcPET film in the presence or absence of the sur -
factants at various reaction temperatures by SDS-PAGE analysis using a previously reported method
21. Adsorbed 
TfCut2 was collected from the film after a 3-h reaction at 40 °C–65 °C in the presence or absence of the optimized 
surfactant at each temperature. As shown in Fig.  3b, the amount of bound enzyme increased with increased 
reaction temperature even in the absence of surfactant, suggesting enhanced hydrophobic interactions between 
the enzyme and lcPET surface at high temperature. The addition of surfactant further increased the amount of 
enzyme adsorbed onto lcPET film at all temperatures tested. The cationic surfactant would increase the local con-
centration of TfCut2 near the lcPET surface through electrostatic interactions, then these enzymes would bind to 
the lcPET surface through hydrophobic interactions, as observed in reactions without surfactant.
Long-duration PET hydrolysis reaction in the presence of cationic surfactant. As reported previ-
ously21, the amount of lcPET hydrolysis product generated by cutinase continued to increase even 24 h after adding 
the enzyme. We thus investigated long-duration lcPET hydrolysis with TfCut2 in the presence or absence of sur-
factants. The Bicine buffer concentration was increased from 50 to 150 mM to prevent acidification of the reaction 
mixture by the hydrolyzed products TPA and MHET. As shown in Fig. 4, TfCut2 without surfactant resulted in 7.5% 
weight loss of lcPET after a 24-h reaction whereas the addition of surfactant accelerated the reaction, resulting in 
15% weight loss of lcPET film, comparable to the activity observed with PETase plus surfactant (18% weight loss 
after a 24-h reaction). However, in contrast to PETase, the amount of degradation after a 36-h reaction increased 
linearly even in the presence of surfactant, indicating that the added surfactant did not denature TfCut2.

Mutagenesis of the active site of TfCut2.  Our developed approach is applicable to mutant enzymes 21 
and thus we further improved activity by introducing mutations into the active site of TfCut2, then measured cat-
alytic activity in the absence or presence of C12-N(CH3)3
+. The amino acids to replace were selected by comparing 
the TfCut2 and PETase sequences. We identified G62(A89), H129(W159), and F209(S238) as non-conserved 
amino acid residues around the active site, as summarized in Fig.  5a,b, where the residue name and number in 
parentheses refer to the PETase. The G62A mutant was previously reported by Wei et al. as a highly active TfCut2 
mutant designed by sequence comparison with LCC
22. We thus substituted these three residues to alanine or the 
corresponding amino acid in PETase.
We examined the initial 3-h lcPET degradation rates of the single mutation TfCut2 proteins at 65 °C in the 
absence of surfactant. As shown in Fig. 5c, the catalytic activities of the TfCut2s mutants, except H129A, were 1.5–
2.9 times higher than that of wild-type TfCut2. The G62A mutant showed 2.1 times greater activity, consistent with 
the previous report22. Replacing F209 with serine or alanine greatly improved the catalytic activity, from 2.5 to 5.4 
or 7.2 nmol min−1 cm−2, respectively. We assumed that the bulky phenylalanine aromatic ring might inhibit bind-
ing to lcPET. We thus confirmed the effect of side-chain size on catalytic activity (Fig. S3) and found that catalytic

hydrolyzed lcPET film.

activity mainly depends on the size of the side-chain rather than its hydrophobicity. The H129W mutant exhibited 
higher activity than wild-type TfCut2, indicating that the Trp residue is more favorable than histidine for inter-
action with the PET benzene ring. In contrast, the H129A variant showed dramatically decreased activity, sug-
gesting that aromatic-ring interaction (e.g., T-stacking proposed by Han et al.) is essential for PET degradation
14.  
The catalytic activities of the mutants in the presence of 30 ppm C12-N(CH3)3
+ at 65 °C were also monitored. As 
shown in Fig. 5c, although the H129A mutant showed decreased activity under this reaction condition, the other 
four mutants showed 1.8–2.7 times greater activity (corresponding to 7.2–14.2 nmol min−1 cm−2) than the activ-
ity in the absence of surfactant.
We next prepared the five double mutants G62A/H129W , G62A/F209S, G62A/F209A, H129W/F209S, and 
H129W/F209A. The H129A mutant was not prepared due to the poor activity of the single mutant. The cata-
lytic activities of the double mutants in the absence or presence of C
12-N(CH3)3
+ were measured. As shown in 
Fig. 6, the mutants G62A/H129W , G62A/F209S, and G62A/F209A showed increased activities of 6.5, 8.7, and  
15 nmol min −1 cm −2, respectively, which are higher than those of the corresponding single mutants. 
Furthermore, the activities of these three mutants were accelerated by the addition of cationic surfactant, with 
the G62A/F209A mutant exhibiting an activity of 31 nmol min
−1 cm−2 in the presence of the surfactant. This is 
a 12.7 times higher activity than that of wild-type TfCut2 in the absence of surfactant. In contrast to the above 
mutants, substitution of F209S and F209A mutants to tryptophan in the H129 had a negative effect on the 
PET hydrolysis reaction, with the H129W/F209S and H129W/F209A double mutants showing lower activity 
than the corresponding single mutants. These results suggest that simultaneous substitution of H129 and F209 
caused drastic changes in the active site structure such that it cannot accommodate the substrate.
We investigated long-duration lcPET hydrolysis reactions using the G62A/F209A mutant in the presence of 
30 ppm C
12-N(CH3)3
+ at 65 °C. Surprisingly, 73 ± 1.6% weight loss of lcPET film was observed after 24 h (Fig. 7a), 
then the degradation rate gradually decreased. It was previously reported that TfCut2 is inhibited by MHET 
released during the reaction 22,25–27 (Table S2) and thus we performed hydrolysis reactions with a single lcPET 
film in different volumes of reaction solution (300, 500, and 1000 µL; 2.0, 1.2, and 0.6 cm2 mL−1, respectively) to 
decrease the product concentration. We observed an increased degradation rate as the reaction volume increased 
(Fig. 7b). The weight loss of lcPET film in a 1000 µL reaction volume linearly increased to 90% ± 4.5% up to a 
24-h reaction time, indicating that high product concentration inhibited enzyme activity. After a 30-h reaction, 
the film was almost completely degraded. Although acidification of the reaction solution by the released product 
slows activity, the activity was only slightly improved by increasing the buffer concentration, suggesting that 
product inhibition is the major factor slowing lcPET hydrolysis by TfCut2 (Fig. S4).

High crystallinity PET hydrolysis.  An increase in PET substrate crystallinity directly affects the PET 
degradation rate due to decreased polymer chain mobility 28. We therefore investigated the hydrolysis activity 
of wild-type TfCut2 and G62A/F209A mutant towards high-crystallinity PET film (hcPET, 40% crystallinity, 
0.6 cm2, 190 µm thick) in the presence or absence of 30 ppm C12-N(CH3)3
+ at 65 °C. As shown in Fig. S5, although 
the hcPET film degradation rate of wild-type TfCut2 in the absence of the surfactant was very slow (0.01  nmol 
min−1 cm−2), the rate was increased 2.4-fold by addition of the surfactant. The G62A/F209A mutant in the pres-
ence of surfactant showed the highest degradation rate under these reaction conditions (0.07 nmol min−1 cm−2), 
which is 6.2 times higher than the activity of wild-type in the absence of surfactant. Nonetheless, the amount of 
hydrolysis was very low, suggesting that efficient hcPET hydrolysis requires new approaches, not simply improv-
ing the activity of the enzyme towards lcPET.
Conclusions
In conclusion, the additive-based approach for improving enzymatic activity to that observed using PETase can be 
applied to thermostable TfCut2. We showed that the design of electrostatic interactions between the enzyme and 
added surfactant is important for enhancing enzyme adsorption onto lcPET film and subsequent hydrolysis. The 
catalytic activity of TfCut2 was increased from 2.5 ± 0.1 to 6.0 ± 0.3 nmol min
−1 cm−2 by addition of the cationic

surfactant C12-N(CH3)3
+ at 65 °C. Additionally, by integrating our approach with mutagenesis, the G62A/F209A 
double mutant showed 12.7 times higher activity than wild-type TfCut2. Furthermore, 90% ± 4.5% degradation 
of lcPET after a 24-h reaction was observed with the G62A/F209A mutant in the presence of C 12-N(CH3)3
+, 
which is the highest rate reported to date for PET hydrolases. We believe that use of this double mutant in combi-
nation with a flow reactor (reported by Barth et al.) will find industrial application27.

DNA encoding cutinase from Thermobifida fusca  KW3 (TfCut2, PDB ID: 4CG1; Table S3) was synthesized 
with codon optimization for expression in E. coli cells (Eurofins Genomics).
Methods. Cloning and mutant construction. The DNA encoding TfCut2 was digested with NdeI/XhoI and 
ligated into pET21-b (Novagen) digested with NdeI/XhoI. The plasmid contained a His6-tag at the C-terminus of 
the DNA encoding TfCut2. Mutant TfCut2 proteins were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis based on this 
plasmid. Primer sequences are shown in Table S4.
Expression and purification.  E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with the plasmid encoding TfCut2 and its 
mutants (except G62A/F209A) were cultured in LB medium at 37 °C to OD
600 = 0.4. TfCut2 expression was 
induced by the addition 0.1 mM isopropyl-D-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C for 4 h. The cells were harvested 
by centrifugation (4 °C, 10,000 × g, 10 min), the cell pellets were resuspended in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0), then 
lysed by sonication on ice. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation (4 °C, 10,000 × g, 10 min) and the super-
natant was applied to a Ni-NTA agarose column (Qiagen). The column was washed with wash buffer (20 mM 
Tris-HCl, 40 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) and TfCut2 was eluted using elution buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 100 mM imi-
dazole, pH 8.0). The fraction containing TfCut2 was dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at 4 °C and the 
concentration of TfCut2 was measured using protein assay CBB solution (Nacalai Tesque).
Expression and purification of the G62A/F209A mutant. E. coli BL21(DE3) cells transformed with the plasmid 
encoding the G62A/F209A mutant were cultured in LB medium at 37 °C to OD
600 = 0.4. Expression of the mutant 
was induced by the addition 0.1 mM isopropyl-D-thiogalactopyranoside at 37 °C for 6 h, then the cells were har-
vested by centrifugation (4 °C, 10,000 × g, 10 min). The enzyme was contained in the culture supernatant. The 
culture supernatant was dialyzed against 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) at 4 °C, then the enzyme was purified as 
described for wild-type TfCut2.
PET film preparation for enzymatic hydrolysis. PET sheets (lcPET and hcPET) were washed with 1 L 20% (v/v) 
ethanol for 10 min, followed by 1 L MilliQ water for 10 min, and then dried at 35 °C for 24 h. The dried sheets were 
cut into 6-mm diameter pieces to provide the test PET films.
lcPET film hydrolysis. A single lcPET film (7.5 mg, 0.6 cm
2) in 500 µL buffer (50 mM Bicine, 10 mM CaCl2, pH 
9.0) was pre-incubated at each temperature for 1 h with or without surfactant. The reaction temperature was 
adjusted using a bioshaker to 40 (39), 50 (48), 55 (53), 60 (58), 65 (63), 70 (67) and 75 (70)°C (M•BR–024, Taitec 
and BR–23FH, Taitec,), where the numbers in parenthesis are the temperatures of the reaction samples directly 
measured using a thermometer. The solution temperatures have ± 0.6 °C variation from the setting temperature 
of the incubator depending on the place of sample incubated. lcPET hydrolysis reactions were initiated by the 
addition of wild-type or mutant TfCut2 (final concentration adjusted to 1 µM). After 3 h, the reaction was termi-
nated by the addition of 500 µL dilution solution (70% (v/v) MilliQ water, 20% (v/v) acetonitrile, and 10% (v/v) 
formic acid). The diluted solutions containing the hydrolyzed products were analyzed by reverse-phase high 
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).
HPLC analysis. The HPLC methods were as we reported previously
21. Briefly, the PET hydrolysis products were 
separated using an LC-2010A HT system (Shimadzu Corporation) equipped with a Cosmosil 5C18-AR-II guard 
column and a Cosmosil 5C18-AR-II column (Nacalai Tesque). A mixture of 70% MilliQ water, 20% acetonitrile, 
and 10% formic acid was used as the mobile phase at a flow rate of 1.0 mL min
−1. The oven temperature was 40 °C. 
The concentrations of the hydrolyzed products (TPA, MHET, and BHET) were calculated from the areas of the 
254-nm absorption peaks using a calibration curve (see following section).
TPA, MHET, and BHET calibration curves for HPLC analysis. TPA standard solutions (0.00025, 0.0005, 0.05, 
0.05, 0.1 mM) and 0.001, 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5 mM MHET and BHET standard solutions were prepared. The MHET 
solutions were obtained by BHET hydrolysis by PETase, as we reported previously
21. TPA, MHET, and BHET 
calibration curves were constructed based on the HPLC peak area of the compound at each concentration. The 
retention time of TPA, MHET, and BHET was 4.1, 5.0, and 6.0 min, respectively.

Surfactant effects on enzyme adsorption on lcPET film. LcPET film was pre-incubated with or without optimized 
surfactant at 40 °C–70 °C, then used for 3-h hydrolysis reactions. The surfactant and optimal concentration were 
chosen based on the results shown in Fig. S1. The hydrolyzed film was rinsed with MilliQ water for 30 s and dried 
at 65 °C for 1 h. The enzyme is unstable at 70 °C and thus adsorption analysis was not performed at this temper-
ature24. The adsorbed enzyme on the dried film was eluted with 2% SDS solution and the eluted enzyme was 
separated using SDS-PAGE.
Water-soluble substrate hydrolysis. p-Nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB; 10 mM) dissolved in DMSO was diluted to 
100 µM in 50 mM Bicine buffer (pH 9.0) to provide substrate solution. The substrate solution was transferred to a 
quartz cell and the reaction was initiated by the addition of TfCut2 (10 mM final concentration). The reaction was 
conducted at room temperature because the substrate spontaneously hydrolyzed at elevated temperature and at 
pH values of 9.0 or higher. We confirmed the effects of C12-N(CH3)3
+ on pNPB hydrolysis activity by performing 
the reaction in the presence of 250 ppm surfactant. The production rate of the hydrolyzed product p-nitrophenol 
(molar extinction coefficient = 11700 M−1 cm−1) was monitored by absorption at 415 nm for the initial 20 s of the 
reaction. Reactions mixtures lacking enzyme were used as controls.
Long-duration lcPET hydrolysis with wild-type TfCut2 or the G62A/F209A mutant. LcPET films were 
pre-incubated for 1 h with or without 30 ppm C12-N(CH3)3
+ at 65 °C, then hydrolysis reactions were performed 
using 1 µM enzyme in 500 µL buffer (150 mM Bicine, 10 mM CaCl2, pH 9.0) at 65 °C for 3, 8, 24, and 48 h (with 
wild-type TfCut2) or 3, 6, 12, 24, 30, 36, and 48 h (with the G62A/F209A mutant). Next, 10 µL of reaction solution 
containing the hydrolyzed products was transferred to a new tube, diluted with 990 µL of dilution solution, and 
analyzed by HPLC.
The weight loss of PET film was calculated based on the total amount of released compound produced from a 
single lcPET film after complete hydrolysis using 2 M NaOH. The total amount of released compound was 84 mM, 
corresponding to 8.3 mg, consistent with the initial weight of the PET film (7.5 mg).
Effects of buffer concentration and reaction volume on long-duration lcPET hydrolysis. A single lcPET film was 
pre-incubated in 500 µL of higher concentration buffer (250 mM Bicine, 10 mM CaCl2, 30 ppm C12-N(CH3)3
+, pH 
9.0) or 300, 500, and 1000 µL buffer (150 mM Bicine, 10 mM CaCl2, 30 ppm C12-N(CH3)3
+, pH 9.0) for 1 h at 65 °C. 
The reaction was initiated by the addition of enzyme at a final concentration of 1 µM. After a 24-h incubation, 
10 µL of the reaction solution was diluted with 990 µL of dilution solution and analyzed by HPLC.
hcPET hydrolysis by wild-type TfCut2 and the G62A/F209A mutant.  A single hcPET film (0.6 cm2) was 
pre-incubated in 500 µL buffer (50 mM Bicine, 10 mM CaCl2, pH 9.0) with or without 30 ppm C12-N(CH3)3
+ for 
1 h at 65 °C. The hydrolysis reaction was initiated by the addition of 1 µM enzyme. After a 3-h incubation at 65 °C, 
the reaction was terminated by the addition of 500 µL dilution solution and the diluted solution was analyzed by 
HPLC.
