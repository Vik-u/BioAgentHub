Abstract: Plastic pollution is a growing environmental problem, in part due to the extremely stable
and durable nature of this polymer. As recycling does not provide a complete solution, research
has been focusing on alternative ways of degrading plastic. Fungi provide a wide array of enzymes
specialized in the degradation of recalcitrant substances and are very promising candidates in
the ﬁeld of plastic degradation. This review examines the present literature for different fungal
enzymes involved in plastic degradation, describing their characteristics, efﬁcacy and biotechnological
applications. Fungal laccases and peroxidases, generally used by fungi to degrade lignin, show good
results in degrading polyethylene (PE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC), while esterases such as cutinases
and lipases were successfully used to degrade polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyurethane
(PUR). Good results were also obtained on PUR by fungal proteases and ureases. All these enzymes
were isolated from many different fungi, from both Basidiomycetes and Ascomycetes, and have shown
remarkable efﬁciency in plastic biodegradation under laboratory conditions. Therefore, future
research should focus on the interactions between the genes, proteins, metabolites and environmental
conditions involved in the processes. Further steps such as the improvement in catalytic efﬁciency
and genetic engineering could lead these enzymes to become biotechnological applications in the
ﬁeld of plastic degradation.

1. Introduction
The word plastic derives from the Greek “plastikos”, meaning “able to be modeled” [1].
Today, the term plastic refers to a range of synthetic long-chain polymeric molecules which,
in the 1950s, started to be substituted for natural materials across a range of different sectors
and in everyday applications [ 2]. The rapid development of plastics can be attributed
to their combination of lightness, durability and other intrinsic properties, along with
their easy and low-cost production [ 3]. As a result of their versatility, plastic materials
have been increasingly used, reaching global production of almost 370 million tonnes in
2020 [4]. Almost 55 million tonnes of plastic were produced in Europe in 2020 [4]. The most
commonly used plastics are polyethylene (PE; 30.3%), polypropylene (PP; 19.7%), polyvinyl
chloride (PVC; 9.6%), polyethylene terephthalate (PET; 8.4%), polyurethane (PUR; 7.8%)
and polystyrene (PS; 6.1%) [4,5].
1.1. Plastic Pollution
The mass of plastics in municipal solid waste in high-income and developing countries
increased from less than 1% in 1960 to more than 10% in 2005 [6]. In Europe, 6.9 million
tonnes of plastics were dumped in landﬁlls in 2020 [ 4]. One of the problems of plastics
accumulated in landﬁlls or released into the environment, is the long time they take to
decay. This long decay time derives from the inherent characteristics of plastic, especially
the high molecular weight, crystallinity and hydrophobicity [3,7], and from the fact that its
Microorganisms 2022, 10, 1180. https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms10061180 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/microorganisms
Microorganisms 2022, 10, 1180 2 of 27
monomers, such as ethylene and propylene, originate from fossil hydrocarbons [8]. This
results in the accumulation and persistence of plastic in land, freshwater, and oceans for
many decades [9,10]. Moreover, supplementary chemicals and additives are often added
to plastic polymers to increase the quality of the ﬁnal products [11]. These additives such
as endocrine disrupting chemicals (bisphenol A, bisphenol S, octylphenol and nonylphe-
nol) [12], dioxin-like compounds [13] and heavy metals [14,15] can cause negative effects
on organisms. Reproductive abnormalities, disruption of the endocrine system, diabetes
and obesity could be linked to additives in plastics [16].
A further problem associated with plastic pollution is the formation of small particles
called microplastics, which originate from plastic fragmentation. Microplastics and bigger
plastic fragments can enter the food chain and be transferred to higher trophic level
organisms where they accumulate [ 17]. Microplastics can also be the carrier for toxic
chemicals and pathogens, facilitating their dispersion in the environment and threatening
ecosystems [3,5].
In 2020, 12.4 million tonnes of plastics were used for energy recovery [4] and plastic
incineration plays an important role in the management of municipal solid waste [ 18].
However, energy recovery by incineration can lead to harmful and toxic emissions, such
as dioxins, furans, heavy metals and sulphides, contributing to environmental pollu-
tion [19–21]. Recycling is a better alternative for plastic waste management, but it is not the
ultimate solution to the plastic problem. For example, the mechanical properties of recycled
PET are reduced with each reuse and the thermal degradation of PE by pyrolysis leads to
the random breaking of C–C bonds with the consequent drastic change in its mechanical
properties [22]. Moreover, the extremely low percentage of PP recycling (<1%) is alarming
since in many cases it is not found as the only polymer forming an object. In addition, the
tertiary carbon in PP is susceptible to photo-oxidative and thermo-oxidative degradation,
requiring a stabiliser to be added in the production stage, contributing to the deterioration
of recycled PP properties [22].
1.2. Plastic Biodegradation
Biodegradation is a complex process of physico-chemical transformation of polymers
into smaller units mediated by microorganisms [23,24]. Microorganisms, including fungi,
are able to biochemically degrade, assimilate and metabolise complex organic compounds,
xenobiotics and recalcitrant substances for their energy needs [25,26]. Several organisms
and different mechanisms are being investigated at the moment to improve and promote
the biodegradation of complex and polluting polymers. For example, the addition of
bacteria with speciﬁc engineered plasmids in polluted sites could transfer the catabolic
genes in the plasmids to the indigenous bacterial population increasing their capacity for
xenobiotic degradation [27]. Furthermore, it is possible to insert mutations in bacterial
genes that increase the biodegradative capacity of their enzymes. Thanks to this technique,
Lu et al. [28] created an algorithm for an engineered and robust PET hydrolase that can be
active in a wide range of temperatures and pHs. Another interesting line of research is to
exploit extremophile microorganisms, so that they can be used in the bioremediation of
extremely polluted sites. For example, some fungi, such as strains belonging to Fusarium,
Verticillium, Penicillium and Aspergillus, are able to produce metal nanoparticles that allow
them to tolerate and remove heavy metals from heavily polluted water or soil [29].
The ﬁrst step required for the biodegradation of high molecular weight and long-chain
polymers, such as plastics, is the weakening of the polymers’ structure. Many differ-
ent factors can inﬂuence plastic biodegradation, for example, the hydrophobicity of the
exposed area as well as the chemical structure, crystallinity grade and structure, glass
transition, melting temperature and elasticity [ 30–32]. Environmental factors, such as
UV exposure or temperature, can decrease the hydrophobicity of plastics or introduce
carbonyl/carboxyl/hydroxyl groups, increasing their biodegradability [ 33–35]. These
environmental factors can lead to surface roughness, cracks and molecular changes in
plastics [36]. Similarly, the growth of microorganisms on plastic surfaces can modify the
Microorganisms 2022, 10, 1180 3 of 27
physical properties of the plastic by creating cracks and enlarging the pore size. Microor-
ganisms can also chemically deteriorate plastics, for example, by changing the pH of the
surrounding microenvironment [37].
The second step in plastic biodegradation is the depolymerisation into shorter chains.
The microbial exoenzymes involved in this process create intermediates with modiﬁed
properties, that increase their cellular assimilation [ 38]. After intermediates are created
and assimilated, they are used by cells as carbon sources and broken down into water and
carbon dioxide or methane to complete the mineralization process [5,24].
The complexity of plastic biodegradation is due to their chemical and physical charac-
teristics, such as their high molecular weight, hydrophobicity and insolubility [39]. The use
of ﬁlamentous fungi for the bioremediation process of plastics can overcome this problem.
Indeed, ﬁlamentous fungi present a typical hyphal apical growth form that allows them to
extend their mycelial networks into different kinds of materials [40]. The penetrative abili-
ties of fungal hyphae are associated with their secretion of exoenzymes and hydrophobins,
increasing their adhesion to hydrophobic substrates [ 41]. Moreover, the non-speciﬁcity
of fungal exoenzymes allows them to break down different plastic polymers [ 42]. For
example, fungal hydrolases (lipases, carboxylesterases, cutinases and proteases) can modify
the plastic surface, increasing its hydrophilicity [43]. These enzymes are also involved in
PET and PUR biodegradation due to the presence of hydrolysable chemical bonds in the
polymer structures [44–46]. On the other hand, oxidoreductases (laccases and peroxidases)
are involved in plastic degradation into smaller molecules such as oligomers, dimers and
monomers [47,48]. Due to their highly stable carbon–carbon (C–C) bonds, plastic polymers
such as PE, PS, PP and PVC require oxidation before the depolymerisation process [39,49].
In this context, this review will examine the different fungal enzymes involved in
the degradation processes of the primary petroleum-based plastic polymers, describing
their main characteristics, their efﬁcacy and their possible biotechnological applications.
Therefore, the aim of this review is to provide an extensive and reliable assessment of all
the present knowledge on fungal enzymes in plastic biodegradation as a start base for new
bioremediation applications.
2. Fungal Enzymes Involved in Plastic Biodegradation
The main classes of enzymes involved in plastic biodegradation are hydrolases and
oxidoreductases (Table 1). These enzymes have been extensively studied due to their
involvement both in natural and industrial processes. For example, in nature and industry
they are essential in lignocellulose biodegradation [50], fungal pathogenesis [51] and the
hydrolysis of triacylglycerol to fatty acids [52]. These enzymes also have applications in
the food and textile industries [53–55], and in bioremediation processes [56,57].
2.1. Laccases (EC 1.10.3.2)
Laccases (EC 1.10.3.2) are a class of enzyme belonging to the blue copper oxidases and
are multicopper monomeric glycoproteins [58]. They use oxygen as an electron acceptor to
oxidize phenolic and non-phenolic compounds, and they are involved in the reduction of
molecular oxygen to water [59–61].
Laccases were ﬁrst discovered in the plant species Rhus vernicifera in 1883 [62]. In
1896 they were identiﬁed in fungi for the ﬁrst time by Bertrand and Laborde [ 63,64].
In the following years, laccases were discovered in many species of fungi belonging to
Ascomycetes, Basidiomycetes and Deuteromycetes [65]. White-rot fungi are the most studied
group in relation to their ability to produce laccases to degrade lignin [ 63]. Indeed, in
nature, fungal laccases are involved in lignin degradation and in the removal of toxic
phenols produced during this process [ 66]. Moreover, they play a role in the synthesis
of dihydroxynaphthalene melanins, compounds that are useful for protection against
environmental stress [67]. Thanks to their characteristics, laccases are used in a number of
industrial applications such as deligniﬁcation, pulp bleaching and bioremediation processes
removing toxic compounds through oxidative enzymatic coupling [64].

2.2. Peroxidases (EC 1.11.1)
Peroxidases (EC 1.11.1) are a group of haem containing oxidoreductases, which catal-
yse the oxidation of organic and inorganic compounds and the reduction of hydrogen per-
oxide [68]. Peroxidases are divided into three classes: class-I are intracellular peroxidases
that are found in most living organisms, except animals; class-II are extracellular fungal per-
oxidases; class-III are extracellular plant peroxidases [69]. The main fungal peroxidases are
manganese peroxidases (MnP; EC 1.11.1.13), lignin peroxidases (LiP; EC 1.11.1.14), versatile
peroxidases (EC 1.11.1.16) and dye decolorizing peroxidases (EC 1.11.1.19), depending on
what they use for the reducing substrate [70].
Microorganisms 2022, 10, 1180 5 of 27
The most well-known group of peroxidase-producing fungi are the ligninolytic fungi
such as white-rot fungiPhanerochaete chrysosporium, Trametes versicolor, Pleurotus spp., Phlebia
radiata, Bjerkandera adusta, Ceriporiopsis subvermispora and Dichomitus squalens [68,70,71]. LiP
and MnP were ﬁrst discovered and puriﬁed in the extracellular medium of a Phanerochaete
chrysosporium culture in the 1980s [ 72–75]. Since then, studies have continued to better
understand the functioning of these enzymes, and in 2010 the structure of the MnP of
P . chrysosporiumwas reﬁned at 0.93 Å resolution [76].
The main characteristics of peroxidases are their non-speciﬁcity and their ability to
oxidise substrates with high redox potential [ 70,77]. These properties have led to these
enzymes being used in a large number of applications. Peroxidases are involved in the
production of biofuels and paper [78], in waste treatment [68] and in the bioremediation
of industrial pollutants such as synthetic dyes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
(PAHs) [40,79–85].
2.3. Cutinases (E.C. 3.1.1.74)
Cutinases (E.C. 3.1.1.74) are extracellular serine esterases and are divided into two
fungal subfamilies and one bacterial subfamily [ 86]. These subfamilies have a different
primary structure according to whether they are eukaryotic or prokaryotic [87]. Cutinases
have an α/βfold, and a central β-sheet composed of ﬁve parallel strands covered by two
or three helices on either side of the sheet [88]. Their active site is uncovered and consists
of a catalytic triad of Ser-His-Asp/Glu [89]. One exception is the active site of Trichoderma
reesei cutinase, which has a covered active site, similar to a lipase [ 90]. In this case the
imidazole of the histidine removes a proton from the serine hydroxyl group and the serine
oxygen makes a nucleophilic attack on the substrate acyl carbonyl carbon [91]. Then, by a
transacylation reaction with the serine, the substrate becomes an acyl-enzyme intermediate,
which is then hydrolysed to release the product. The development of a negative charge
during the formation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate is stabilized by an oxyanion hole of
cutinase [88,92].
In nature, because they can degrade ester bonds, cutinases are involved in fungal
pathogenesis [88]. Cutinases are also multifunctional enzymes with many industrial appli-
cations due to their ability to catalyse hydrolysis reactions, esteriﬁcations and transesteriﬁ-
cations [93]. These properties make them suitable for the degradation of high molecular
weight polyesters [94] and useful in synthetic ﬁbre modiﬁcation [95].
2.4. Lipases (EC 3.1.1.3)
Fungal lipases (EC 3.1.1.3) are extracellular triacylglycerol acyl hydrolases that can
hydrolyse ester bonds from insoluble substrates of tri-, di- and mono-glycerides into free
fatty acids and glycerol [ 96,97]. Therefore, lipases are involved in lipid metabolism in
processes such as digestion, absorption and reconstitution [98].
Lipase-producing fungi have been isolated from different habitats such as contami-
nated soils, wastes and deteriorated food [98–100]. The main genera of lipase-producing
fungi are Aspergillus, Acremonium, Alternaria, Beauveria, Candida, Eremothecium, Fusarium,
Geotrichum, Humicola, Mucor, Ophiostoma, Penicillium, Rhizomucor, Rhizopus and Tricho-
derma [96,101].
Fungal lipases are used in a number of industrial applications such as in the food,
textile and manufacturing industries and in the production of detergents, cosmetics and
pharmaceuticals [102]. Moreover, lipases can degrade fatty wastes [103] and polyurethane
(PUR) [104].
3. Types of Plastics and Their Biodegradation by Fungi
3.1. Polyethylene (PE)
Polyethylene (PE) is one of the most abundant and most widely commercialized syn-
thetic, petroleum-based, thermoplastic materials [105,106]. PE consists of long linear chains
of ethylene monomers (C2H4)n [107] and can be divided into high-density polyethylene
Microorganisms 2022, 10, 1180 6 of 27
(HDPE) and low-density polyethylene (LDPE), according to the number of carbon atoms
and the molecular weight [108] (Table 2). HDPE, so called because it has a molecular weight
between 100,000–250,000 Daltons [109], is used in bottles for cleaning products, houseware
items and for toy production, making up 12.9% of the total plastic demand in Europe [4].
On the other hand, LDPE has a molecular weight of 40,000 Daltons [109] and is mainly used
in single-use plastics such as bags and food packaging ﬁlms, composing 17.4% of the total
plastic demand in Europe [4]. Due to the short time period for the use of PE products, they
are rapidly accumulated in the environment in large numbers [110,111]. Over the years,
this large abundance of PE in the environment has led to the investigation of alternative
disposal methods, including microbial biodegradation.

High-density
polyethylene (HDPE) 12.9% 100,000–250,000
Low-density
polyethylene (LDPE) 17.4% 40,000
One of the main problems of using microbes to degrade PE is its high molecular weight,
which limits the number of possible enzymatic reactions. Usually, a microorganism’s
enzymatic systems use substrates with 10–50 carbons. Therefore, in order to degrade PE
using microbes, a reduction in its molecular weight is necessary. Moreover, the transport
of molecules through the cell membrane also requires a lower molecular weight [ 49].
After the decrease in molecular weight, enzymes must oxidise the polymer to transform
it into a carboxylic acid that can be metabolized by β-oxidation and the Krebs cycle [112].
The reduction in molecular weight can be performed using abiotic factors such as UV
light and heat, or by microbial enzymes [ 49]. Most studies investigating this enzymatic
reduction have focused on bacteria that use laccase and alkane hydroxylase from the AlkB
family [113,114]. However, the advantage of fungal biodegradation is in the production of
exoenzymes. Hydrophobins, fungal surface hydrophobic proteins that facilitate hyphae
adhesion to a plastic surface, and exoenzymes, such as peroxidases and oxidases, promote
oxidation or hydrolysis [ 38,39,41,115,116]. The most studied fungal genera belong to
Ascomycota and are Aspergillus, Penicillium, Trichoderma and Fusarium [117–123], whereas
Basidiomycota or Mucoromycota are less investigated. In addition, the involvement of fungi
such as Phanerochaete chrysosporium [124], Bjerkandera adusta [125], Trametes versicolor [115]
and Rhizopus oryzae [126] in PE biodegradation has also been reported.
3.2. Fungal Enzymes Involved in PE Biodegradation
The main fungal enzymes involved in polyethylene biodegradation are the lignolitic
enzymes laccases (Lac, EC 1.10.3.2.) and peroxidases (EC 1.11.1.7) [116,117,120,127].
The effect of these enzymes on PE has been studied extensively in Basidiomycota, but
they are also present in Ascomycota. For example, the ascomycete Trichoderma harzianum is
able to produce both laccase (Mw 88 kDa) and peroxidase (Mw 55 kDa) when involved
in PE biodegradation [120]. Indeed, the treatment of PE with 0.01071 IU/mL of its laccase
caused a reduction in mass of 0.5% after 10 days incubation, while the treatment of PE
with 0.01080 IU/mL of its peroxidase caused a 0.6% loss of mass. As a result of the
Microorganisms 2022, 10, 1180 7 of 27
enzymatic treatment, carboxylic acids, aldehydes, aromatics, alcohols, esters, ethers and
alkyl halides groups were formed and detected by Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy
(FTIR) analysis.
A particularly interesting ascomycete involved in HDPE microplastic biodegradation
(density 0.955 g/cm3, size below 200 µm) is Aspergillus ﬂavus PEDX3, which was isolated
from the gut of the wax moth Galleria mellonella [38]. This strain was able to depolymer-
ize HDPE long chains and produce lower molecular weight fragments after 28 days of
incubation. A. ﬂavus PEDX3 action could be attributed to its capacity to produce laccases
and laccase-like multicopper oxidases (LMCOs). Gene sequencing analysis using RT-PCR
led to the identiﬁcation of two genes (AFLA_006190 and AFLA_053930) that may encode
potential degrading LMCOs [38].
In the Basidiomycota, partially puriﬁed manganese peroxidase (MnP , EC 1.11.1.13)
from Phanerochaete chrysosporium ME-446 caused signiﬁcant PE degradation when 0.1%
Tween 80 was present in the growing medium, reducing tensile strength and elonga-
tion [115]. Moreover, after the addition of 0.1 mM manganese sulfate (MnSO4), PE molec-
ular weight (Mw) decreased from 716,000 to 89,500 Daltons and the relative elongation
changed from 100% to 0%. Although exogenous H2O2 supply is not necessary for polyethy-
lene degradation, it is essential for the MnP reaction system [115].
Fujisawa et al. [128] investigated the effects of a laccase-mediator system (LMS) from
Trametes versicolor IFO 6482 in PE biodegradation. LMS (500 nkat) was able to reduce the
PE elongation by 20% in 3 days, while the addition of 0.2 mM 1-hydroxybenzotriazole
(HBT) to the medium caused no elongation and relative tensile strength decreased by 60%.
Moreover, Mw changed from 242,000 to 28,300 Daltons after 3 days of LMS with HBT
mediator treatment at 30 ◦C.
Another Basidiomycete involved in PE biodegradation is Pleurotus ostreatus, which
can hydrolyse C–C bonds by producing extracellular ligninolytic enzymes including lignin
peroxidase (LiP), manganese peroxidase (MnP) and laccases (Lac). During growth on
semisolid Radha modiﬁed medium in the presence of LDPE sheets, high enzyme production
was detected. Speciﬁcally, the highest Lac and LiP activities were 2.817 U/g and 70.755 U/g
after 30 days and 90 days, respectively, while the highest MnP production was observed at
day 120 (1.097 U/g) [48].
A recent study reports computational molecular simulations between PE (dodecane,
170.3 Daltons) and different enzymes known to degrade it. Santacruz-Juárez et al. [116] stud-
ied the interactions between MnP (manganese peroxidase from Phanerochaete chrysosprium),
LiP (lignin peroxidase from Trametes cervine), Lac (laccase from Trametes versicolor), UnP
(unspeciﬁc peroxygenase from Agrocybe aegerita) or Cut (cutinase from Fusarium solani, as
a negative control) and PE. They measured the binding afﬁnity, i.e., the strength of the
binding interaction between the enzyme and its ligand (PE), and found afﬁnities were UnP
(34.34 µM) > Lac (40.11 µM) > LiP (66.93 µM) > MnP (82.16 µM) > Cut (5590 µM). The high
area (659.920 Å2), volume (367.243 Å3) and hydrophobicity of the UnP catalytic cavity was
suggested to be the reason for the high interaction with PE [129–131]. The hydrophobic-
ity is caused by the presence of phenylalanine residues in the UnP active site [ 116]. The
binding afﬁnity mirrored the binding energy scores, which resulted in −6.09, −6.00, −5.69,
−5.57 and −3.07 Kcal/mol for UnP–PE, Lac–PE, LiP–PE, MnP–PE and Cut–PE complexes,
respectively. Indeed, the lower the required binding energy, the easier the bonds are created.
These computational observations showed that peroxidases can play an important role
in PE biodegradation, and that the non-speciﬁc UnP enzymes can be used in practical
applications due to their distinctive cavity composed of Val244, Phe121, Phe191, Phe199,
Phe274, Ala77, Thr192, Gly195, Glu196, Ser123, Cys33, haem propionate, 1H-imidazol-5-yl
methanol (Mzo354) and two water molecules [116].
Hypothetical biodegradation pathways involving the ligninolytic enzymes (Lac, LiP
and MnP) and PE have been proposed, using as the biosurfactant a fungal hydrophobin
from class-II [41,116]. Speciﬁcally, Bertrand et al. [ 132] hypothesized a PE degradation
pathway that uses Lac from Trametes versicolor; Miki et al. [133] suggested using LiP from
Microorganisms 2022, 10, 1180 8 of 27
Trametes cervine; Sánchez [41], in a computational study, proposed using MnP fromPhane-
rochaete chrysosporium. In order to perform their degradative activity, both MnP and LiP
require the addition of H2O2 to the culture medium [116] and acidic conditions [41]. The in-
volvement of H2O2 is to act as an electron accepting co-substrate in the oxidation-reduction
reactions promoted by MnP and LiP [ 41]. Alternatively, Lac causes the transfer of elec-
trons from organic substrates to molecular oxygen. Therefore, the main difference in PE
biodegradation pathways between laccases and haem peroxidases (LiP and MnP) is based
on the different methods of electron transfer [41].
3.3. Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET)
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is another important synthetic, petroleum-based,
thermoplastic polymer commonly used in everyday life [ 134,135]. PET is a saturated
polyester consisting of terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (C 10H8O4)n with an
average molecular weight ranging from 20,000 to 50,000 Daltons depending on the ﬁeld of
application [136] (Table 3). PET is widely used in beverage bottles, synthetic textile ﬁbres,
ﬁlms and resins, and it has a signiﬁcant market share of plastic ﬁbres thanks to its versatile
performance characteristics [ 137,138]. PET ﬁbres are employed in cloth, technical and
medical textiles, and in furnishings [137]. Nowadays, PET represents 8.4% of the plastics
demand in Europe [4].

PET depolymerisation takes place when it is converted to terephthalic or isophthalic
acid, ethylene glycol and small oligomers such as bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET)
and mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) [139]. These polymers are less harmful
to the environment than PET [ 140]. Although PET is a polyester (compounds that are
considered to degrade more easily), it is recalcitrant to biodegradation [ 141]. However,
fungal genera such as Aspergillus [142,143], Fusarium [144,145] and Penicillium [146,147]
have been reported to be involved in PET biodegradation.
3.4. Fungal Enzymes Involved in PET Biodegradation
In recent times, several studies have looked for enzymes involved in PET biodegra-
dation. However, most studies have focused on bacterial enzymes [148–150] with fungal
enzymes being less investigated.
The main fungal enzymes involved in PET biodegradation are hydrolytic enzymes
acting on ester bonds (esterases; EC 3.1.1), such as cutinases (EC 3.1.1.74), lipases (EC
3.1.1.3) and carboxylesterases (EC 3.1.1.1) [138,149,151].
3.4.1. Cutinases Involved in PET Biodegradation
Specific cutinases able to degrade PET were identified from Humicola insolens
(HiC) [148,152], Fusarium solani pisi(FsC) [148,152–155] and Fusarium oxysporum(FoCut5a) [94].
The most studied enzymes are the cutinases HiC and FsC. HiC has good thermostabil-
ity with a temperature range from 30 to 85 ◦C, an optimum at 80 ◦C, and maximum initial
activity from 70 to 80 ◦C. On the other hand, FsC has a lower temperature range of 30–60◦C
Microorganisms 2022, 10, 1180 9 of 27
with the best performance at 50 ◦C. Ronkvist et al. [152] tested the biodegradation capacity
of HiC and FsC. They found that the hydrolysis rate constantk2 was 7-fold higher for HiC at
70 ◦C than FsC at 40 ◦C (0.62 µmol/cm2/h compared to 0.09 µmol/cm2/h) [152]. Moreover,
the results showed a 97 ±3% weight loss when low-crystallinity PET was incubated with
HiC for 96 h at 70 ◦C, while there was only a 5% decrease after 96 h of incubation with FsC
at 40 ◦C.
A few studies noted that the activity of cutinases was higher for an amorphous PET
polymer compared to that of a highly crystalline substrate [43,154]. Indeed, these enzymes
are sensitive to chain distribution and length [ 156]. An increase in the PET crystallinity
rate from 7% to 35% caused a decrease in the initial enzymatic activities up to 25-fold for
HiC and 6-fold for FsC [152]. The enzymes’ preference for amorphous regions of PET led
to an increase in the biodegradation of these regions and an increase in the crystallinity
rate of the biodegraded polymer [152,153]. Moreover, a high presence of aromatic rings
lowers the rate of hydrolysis. On the other hand, HiC preferably hydrolysed both internal
(terephthalic acid-1,4-butanediol) and external (benzoic acid-1,4 butanediol) ester bonds,
and more rapidly hydrolysed substrates with longer terminal alcohols but shorter chain
length acids [157].
Several studies have focused on trying to explain the biodegradation pathways and
functioning of HiC and FsC. For example, the ability of cutinases to cleave ester bonds of
dissolved materials [158] was conﬁrmed by Eberl et al. [153], who studied the PET monomer
bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET). They observed that a cutinase from F. solani was
able to completely hydrolyse BHET in only 30 min. Terephthalic acid (TPA) formation
started after the complete hydrolysis of BHET to the monoester mono (2-hydroxyl ethyl)
terephthalate (MHET). After the 96 h incubation of low-crystallinity PET with FsC in 1 M
Tris-HCl (pH 8) at 40 ◦C, or with HiC at 70 ◦C, MHET was reduced to terephthalic acid
(TPA) and ethylene glycol [ 152,159]. Nevertheless, after FsC-catalysed PET hydrolysis,
Vertommen et al. [43] observed a predominant production of MHET, some TPA and small
traces of BHET. These differences could be ascribed to changes in the ratio of substrate—
enzyme, or changes in the incubation conditions, which could lead to the incomplete
conversion of water-soluble PET degradation products into TPA.
The active site of a cutinase from Fusarium solani pisi (PDB code1CEX) was genetically
modiﬁed to improve its activity towards PET ﬁbres [ 160]. Previous studies proposed a
3D structure of this enzyme [88] and the native cutinase gene sequence that can be PCR-
amplified with the primers CutFor (5′-CGGGATCCCATGAAACAAAGCACTATTGCACTG-3′)
and CutRev (5′-CGAGCTCGCAGCAGAACCACGGACAGCC-3′) from the vector pDrFST [161].
This information allowed Araújo et al. [157] to carry out computational studies showing
that the increase in the size of the active site corresponds with a 4–5-fold enhancement in
activity. Indeed, the large PET polymer can ﬁt better in the active site after the ampliﬁcation.
Furthermore, it was shown that the mutations L81A, N84A, L182A, V184A and L189A
result in a better stabilization of the tetrahedral intermediate of the model substrates [160]
due to the enlargement of the active site.
Another cutinase with potential in PET bioremediation is produced by Fusarium oxys-
porum, and is called FoCut5a [94,144]. It is highly homologous to F. solani pisi cutinase
(FsC), but the hydrophobic residues Ala62 and Phe63 present in F. solani are replaced by
Lys63 and Tyr64 polar amino acids in FoCut5a at the end of helix a2. Due to these and
other small but signiﬁcant differences, FoCut5a seems slightly more thermostable than
FsC, underlining a possible important role in industrial applications [94]. The optimized
parameters for PET hydrolysis are 40◦C, pH 8 and 1.92 mgFoCut5a per gram of fabric [144].
FoCut5a efﬁcacy was conﬁrmed by superﬁcial changes observable by Fourier-transform in-
frared spectroscopy (FTIR) ATR analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Scanning
Electron Microscope (SEM), as well as through dyeability tests using reactive dyes [144].

3.4.2. Lipases Involved in PET Biodegradation
Lipases are another class of enzymes involved in PET biodegradation [149]. The most
studied that are involved in PET biodegradation are produced by Aspergillus oryzae CCUG
33812 [143] and by the yeasts Candida antarctica (CALB) [140,162] and Pichia pastoris [163].
Aspergillus oryzae CCUG 33812 can produce a lipase able to catalyse PET hydrolysis
using 0.1 g/L bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHT) as an inducer [143]. An increase in
hydrophilicity and antistatic ability, as well as a 0.74% weight loss and a decrease in both
the water contact angle and static half decay time, were observed after 24 h at 55 ◦C [143].
The lipase triacylglycerol hydrolase produced by the yeast Pichia pastoris was able to
modify the surface morphology of polyester ﬁbres at 60 ◦C and at pH 7.5–8. Moreover,
7 h treatment with the combination of 10 g/L P . pastorislipase and 0.5 g/L non-ionic
surfactant JFC (a fatty alcohol polyoxyethylene ether) at 60 ◦C and pH 7.5 changed the
surface morphology of the PET ﬁbres and increased the number of hydrophilic groups [163].
3.4.3. Polyesterases Involved in PET Biodegradation
Extracellular polyesterases involved in PET hydrolyzation are secreted by Beauve-
ria brongniartii [164] and Penicillium citrinum grown on a medium containing cutin with
molecular weight 14.1 kDa, temperature optimum 36 ◦C and pH 8.2 [165].
Polyesterase from B. brongniartii released TPA during treatment of PET [164], while
P . citrinumenzymatic activity liberates only low amounts of TPA in favour of BHET and
MHET [165].
3.4.4. Synergic Action of Cutinase HiC and Lipase CALB
An important PET depolymerization enzyme that can act synergically with HiC is
lipase B from Candida antarctica (CALB) [140,162].
HiC and CALB present two different activity proﬁles at the ﬁnal stage of PET depoly-
merization. Indeed, TPA was the predominant molecule after 24 h of CALB action, while
HiC very quickly converted BHET into MHET, but then TPA formation was slow [ 140].
Despite this, when the two enzymes are used alone, HiC is more efﬁcient than CALB
in degrading PET [ 149], while a synergic action between HiC and CALB led to a more
intense MHET consumption and TPA formation [ 159]. Better results were obtained by
de Castro et al. [140] using HiC and CALB sequentially. This method led to an initial release
of MHET (HiC action at 60 ◦C), which was rapidly converted to TPA after CALB addition
(37 ◦C), resulting in a degradation 141-times higher than when using the two enzymes at
the same temperature [140].
3.4.5. PET Hydrophobicity Modiﬁcation after Fungal Enzymes Action
An interesting reaction observable with most enzymes involved in PET hydrolysa-
tion is the increase in hydrophilicity. The action of hydrolases from Fusarium oxysporum
LCH1 [145] leads to a higher PET hydrophilicity than cutinasefromF . solani pisi[137,166–168].
Indeed, the water adsorption of PET fabrics treated with 80 U of cutinase and hydrolase
was 36 mm/10 min and 57 mm/10 min, respectively [145]. An increase in hydrophilicity
was also observed after the action of polyesterase obtained from Penicillium citrinum [165].
Comparing the measure of rising height, the enzyme preparation of P . citrinumcaused the
largest increase in hydrophilicity on PET (5.1 cm) [165], followed by Aspergillus sp. (4.3 cm),
F. solani (2.3 cm) and Beauveria sp. (1.2 cm) [155]. The increase in hydrophilicity could be
caused by the introduction of polar groups onto the polymer surface [167,168]. This was
conﬁrmed by the increase in hydrophilicity associated with the gain of hydroxylic and
carboxylic acid groups on the PET surface after hydrolysis by an enzyme preparation from
Beauveria brongniartii (0.5 nKat/mL) [164].
3.5. Polyurethane (PUR)
Polyurethane (PUR) is a polymeric, synthetic, petroleum-based, thermosets polymer
composed of repeating units containing ethyl carbamate (H 2NCO2C2H5) and urethane
Microorganisms 2022, 10, 1180 11 of 27
bonds with urea, ether, ester and aromatic groups [169]. Depending on the polyols used in
the condensation reaction to produce PUR, polyurethane can be classiﬁed as a polyester
(esters were used) or a polyether (utilisation of ethers) [47] (Table 4). PUR is a very versatile
material, which can be used as a foam in building insulation, in pillows and mattresses, in
semirigid plastics, as an elastomer, and in paint, adhesive and textile ﬁbres [170,171]. As
with PET, polyurethane made up 7.8% of European plastic demand in 2020 [4].
Table 4. Backbone structural formula of polyurethane (PU), ether-PU and ester-PU.
Name Structure
Polyurethane (PU)
Ether-PU
Ester-PU
Today the disposal of polyurethane is a major problem as its degradation takes hun-
dreds of years [172,173]. Moreover, incineration generates toxic emissions, and the material
becomes useless after a few rounds of recycling [174].
The effectiveness of fungal biodegradation of PUR depends on the polymer molecular
orientation, cross-linking and crystallinity [175]. It is easier to attack polyurethane in the
amorphous regions rather than in the crystalline regions [169]. Moreover, the availability
depends on the absence of ramiﬁcations or on the presence of long repetitive units that
decrease the formation of highly crystalline areas [176,177]. In addition, the presence of
methylene groups encourages fungal degradation [177].
Depending on its composition, polyurethane can be classiﬁed as a polyester or a
polyether polyurethane, which can be more or less targeted by fungi [ 177]. The ester
types are more susceptible to microbial degradation than ether types [178]. Indeed, during
biodegradation, polyesters are subjected to hydrolysis, a reaction catalysed by both acids
and bases and which follows the three-centre mechanism. The result of the hydrolysis of
ester bonds is the liberation of a free acid, making this reaction autocatalytic [173]. On the
other hand, ether bonds are very stable and as a result ether-PU products are a serious
problem in environmental pollution [ 179]. Biodeterioration of polyether polyurethane
can be carried out by oxidation rather than hydrolysis, and it involves the abstraction of
α-hydrogen adjacent to oxygen [180,181]. Adding metal ions such as cobalt can accelerate
this type of degradation [173].
Fungal biodegradation of ether-PU appears to be more promising than bacterial,
especially in foams. This could be due to the ability of fungal hyphae to penetrate into foam
pores, cracking the material mechanically [182] and thereby increasing the accessibility of
chemical bonds for fungal exoenzymes. On the other hand, ester-PU is a substrate that is
more susceptible to fungal enzymes than ether-PU, and several ester-PU degrading fungi
are reported in the literature [183].
3.6. Fungal Enzymes Involved in PUR Biodegradation
Fungal hydrolases such as proteases, esterases, ureases and lipase are involved in the
polyurethane biodegradation process. Ester bonds are cleaved by all these enzymes, while
amide and urethane bonds are only hydrolysed by proteases, and urea is only targeted by
ureases. Urease activity can be detected by phenolic compounds released into culture media,
and this activity is exploited to estimate the amount of biodegradation [ 177]. However,
the action of degradative enzymes is susceptible to the distance between urethane bonds,
Microorganisms 2022, 10, 1180 12 of 27
which can interfere negatively in the biodegradation [183]. There are also speciﬁc enzymes
able to degrade polyurethane, and they are known as polyurethanases (PUase) [39,184].
3.6.1. Esterases Involved in Polyester-PUR Biodegradation
The mechanism of polyester-PUR degradation by esterases was proposed for the ﬁrst
time by Wales and Sagar in 1988 [185]. They suggested that extracellular esterases act by
hydrolysis on polymers containing ester and urethane links. Boubendir [186] reported the
correlation between the increase in esterase activity and the addition of liquid polyester
PUR in cultural medium, suggesting the induction of enzymes with esterase and urethane
hydrolase activities in Chaetomium globosum and Aspergillus terreus. Another extracellular
enzyme-like factor with esterase properties was secreted by Curvularia senegalensis [185].
This enzyme was found to be stable at 100 ◦C for 10 min, displayed a band of 28 kDa in
SDS PAGE analysis and was inhibited by phenylmethylsulphonyl ﬂuoride (PMSF). Its
involvement in polyurethane degradation was observed through the formation of clear
zones in Impranil agar plates [185]. Impranil® DLN (Impranil, Leverkusen, Germany) is
a class of plastics belonging to the polyurethane family [187], and it is commonly used to
determine the ability of a microorganism or a protein to degrade PUR [188].
The esterase ability of PU biodegradation was conﬁrmed by the 1500-fold increase in
esterase production by Cladosporium pseudocladosporioides T1.PL.1 using Impranil as the sole
carbon source [47], and by the increase in Aspergillus fumigatus strain S45’s esterase activity
from 0.1440 µM/Min/mg to 2.687 µM/Min/mg after 15 days of incubation with polyester
PUR as the sole carbon source [189].
Another fungal enzyme able to biodegrade Impranil DLN is produced by Pestalo-
tiopsis microspore E2712A. This observation suggests the involvement of the 21 kDa serine
hydrolase-like enzyme in PU biodegradation [190].
3.6.2. Lipases Involved in Polyester-PUR Biodegradation
Lipases involved in the hydrolytic degradation of polyester polyurethane are secreted
mainly by yeasts belonging to the Candida genus. Kinetics and mathematical models of
PUR degradation by Candida rugosa were proposed by Gautam et al. [191]. In this study,
the maximum degradation rate of 2.5 g PUR/L was reached using 70 µg lipase/mL at pH 7
and 35 ◦C. Moreover, a linear increase in the PUR degradation product, diethylene glycol,
was observed during PUR biodegradation [191].
Candida antarctica lipase represents another potential candidate for PUR biodegra-
dation [104]. Indeed, oligomers with a molecular weight lower than 500 Daltons were
produced after the activity of 20 mg of lipase in toluene (10 mL) at 60 ◦C for 24 h [104].
The Ascomycete Aspergillus tubingenesis is able to degrade polyester PU, producing
both esterases and lipases [ 192]. The optimum pH required for A. tubingenesis esterase
maximum activity was pH 7, while lipase has an optimum at pH 5. For both enzymes,
the optimum temperature was 37 ◦C. An interesting observation made by the authors
of this study is that lipase production augments in the ﬁrst two weeks of culture when
the surfactants Tween 20 or Tween 80 were added to the culture medium, then the lipase
concentration decreased by the end of the month. On the other hand, esterase activities
reached the maximum activity after two weeks in the presence of Tween 80 and continued
to increase slowly until the fourth week in the presence of Tween 20. The gradual decrease
in enzyme production was hypothesized to be due to the surfactants’ repression effect on
the gene responsible for enzyme production [192].
3.6.3. Cutinase Involved in Polyester-PUR Biodegradation
A cutinase demonstrating the ability to degrade PUR was secreted by the thermophilic
fungus Thielavia terrestris CAU709 [193]. The highest production of this enzyme (TtcutA)
was observed when T. terrestrisCAU709 grew using 2% (w/v) wheat bran as the sole carbon
source amended with 0.1% (w/v) Tween 80. The highest enzyme activity (90.4 U/mL) was
observed after 96 h of cultivation. The molecular mass of the puriﬁed TtcutA was between
Microorganisms 2022, 10, 1180 13 of 27
25.3 and 22.8 kDa with optimum conditions at pH 4.0 and a temperature of 50 ◦C [193]. PU
biodegradation was estimated using 0.6% emulsiﬁed PU [193].
3.6.4. Fungal Hydrolyses Involved in Polyether-PUR Biodegradation
As previously reported, enzymatic biodegradation of polyether PUR is more com-
plex than polyester PUR and only a few studies have reported its degradation by fungal
hydrolyses [151,169,194]. Urethane-bond-degrading enzymes and urea-bond-degrading
enzymes were found in a culture supernatant of Alternaria sp. PURDK2. Polyamines (4,4 ′-
methylenedianiline) and polyols were released after the hydrolysation of urethane bonds,
while 4,4′-methylenedianiline and n-polyamines were generated after the degradation of
urea bonds by enzymes of Alternaria sp. PURDK2 [179]. However, an initial mechanical
disruption by fungal hyphae was required for polyether-PUR biodegradation [179].
3.7. Polyvinyl Chloride (PVC)
Polyvinyl chloride (PVC) is a commonly used synthetic, thermoplastic, petroleum-
based material [195]. Pure PVC consists of long chains of ethylene monomers containing
56.77% (w/w) chlorine element (C2H3Cl)n [193] (Table 5). It is a white, brittle, solid poly-
mer, is highly hydrophobic, soluble in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and resilient to chemical
abrasion [24,196].
Table 5. European plastic demand and backbone structural formula of polyvinylchloride.
Name Plastics Demand in Europe Structure
Polyvinylchloride (PVC) 9.6%
PVC represents 9.6% of the total European plastic use [ 4]. It is used in its rigid or
ﬂexible form in pipes and electrical wire insulation, proﬁles of windows or doors, coverings
for ﬂoors and walls, and in textiles such as synthetic leather products, shoe soles, packaging
and credit cards [24,170,196].
Some PVC products have a long lifespan so there is a long time between PVC produc-
tion and waste, but in some products, such as packaging, PVC has a short life. In any case,
long- and short-term PVC products are disposed of at the end of their use [195]. Depositing
in landﬁll and incineration are the most widely used disposal methods for PVC [ 196].
However, during incineration a large amount of hydrogen chloride and tetrachlorodibenzo-
p-dioxin are produced, causing secondary pollution [195–198]. Therefore, PVC biodegrada-
tion has become a topic of particular interest.
The biodegradation of PVC involves three main reactions: chain depolymerization;
oxidation; mineralisation of formed intermediates [196,197]. Fungal PVC biodegradation is
a very difﬁcult process due to the hydrophobicity of the material, its resistance to abrasion
and the persistence of its structure [ 199]. Indeed, modiﬁcation of the molecular weight
of PVC by microorganisms has been reported only in a small number of studies [ 196].
For example, fungal involvement in PVC biodegradation has been found in white-rot
fungi [200] such as Pleurotus sp., Polyporus versicolor, Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Lenti-
nus tigrinus [201,202]; or by Ascomycetes belonging to the genera Aspergillus [202–208],
Cochliobolus [209], Chaetomium [203,210,211], Fusarium [203,205], Mucor [203,212] and Peni-
cillium [203,205,206,212,213].
3.8. Fungal Enzymes Involved in PVC Biodegradation
The fungal enzymes involved in PVC biodegradation are currently not well
known [178,214–216].
It has been reported that PVC biodegradation is related to the ability to degrade
lignin [196,217], as demonstrated by the modiﬁcation of the PVC structure by fungal lignin
Microorganisms 2022, 10, 1180 14 of 27
peroxidase (EC 1.11.1.14) from Phanerocheate chrysosporium [218]. P . chrysosporiumlignin
peroxidase had a molecular weight of 46 kDa and reached its maximum production after
4 weeks at 25 ◦C and pH 5. The weight of PVC ﬁlms decreased by 31% when this partially
puriﬁed enzyme was used and a stretch of alkenyl C–H in the PVC structure was observed
by FTIR analysis (peak at 2943 cm−1) [218].
Another ligninolytic enzyme involved in PVC biodegradation is laccase fromCochliobo-
lus sp. [219]. The higher laccase production (1.793 nKat/mL) was observed after 6 days of
incubation at 30 ◦C and at pH 6.5. Modiﬁcations in FTIR spectra, such as the shifting of
the CH-stretching mode (from 2912 cm−1 to 2915 cm−1) and the appearance of new peaks
corresponding to a carbonyl group, suggested there was activity of Cochliobolus sp. laccase
on the PVC structure. Changes in the PVC structure and surface were conﬁrmed by GC-MS
analysis and SEM photography [219].
Other studies have reported the involvement of fungal ligninolytic enzymes in PVC
biodegradation [201]; however, no attempt was made to quantify the enzyme production
or to demonstrate substrate degradation by puriﬁed enzymes [220].
3.9. Polypropylene (PP)
Polypropylene (PP) is a linear, thermoplastic hydrocarbon synthetic polymer, where a
methyl-group replaces one hydrogen for every carbon of PE structure (C3H6)n [35,221]. PP
is an inert, semicrystalline material, slightly harder and more resistant to heat and chemical
reactions than PE [222]. It has a high hydrophobicity [223] and a molecular weight varying
from 10,000 to 40,000 Daltons [214].
Polypropylene is the most used plastic polymer in Europe, accounting for 19.7% of the
plastic demand [4]. It is used in many industries such as packaging for food and materials,
pipes, automotive parts and diapers [32] (Table 6).

Molecular Weight

Polypropylene (PP) 19.7% 10,000–40,000
Due to the short-term use of these packaging products and the massive and rapid
accumulation of PP in the environment, the study of alternative disposal methods, such as
fungal biodegradation, is an important ﬁeld of research.
Polypropylene proprieties such as hydrophobicity and high molecular weight make it
particularly resistant to microbial attack and biodegradation [214]. Moreover, the addition
of stabilizers and antioxidants to preserve PP from oxidation by atmospheric agents increase
its biodegradation resistance even more [ 224]. Despite these problems, fungi such as
Aspergillus niger were found to be involved in PP biodegradation [ 225–227]. Only a few
other fungal species such as Lasiodiplodia theobromae [228], Bjerkandera adusta [229] and
Engyodontium album [228] were reported as being able to attack PP . Due to its high resistance
and recalcitrance, most studies used pretreatments such as UV or γ-irradiation to make PP
more susceptible to degradation by fungi [226,228,230].
3.10. Fungal Enzymes Involved in PP Biodegradation
Although some studies reported the involvement of fungi in polypropylene biodegra-
dation, so far none have investigated the use of fungal enzymes in the biodegradation
of PP [101,178,214,216,231,232]. Investigating which microorganisms are able to degrade
PP and the identiﬁcation of their enzymes would be an interesting and useful area of
further research.

3.11. Polystyrene (PS)
Polystyrene (PS) is a very stable, synthetic, thermoplastic polymer formed by an
aromatic styrene monomer (C8H8)n [216,233]. PS has a large molecular weight and high
hydrophobicity, which contribute to its rigidity and hardness [214]. The low cost and ease
of production, as well as its lightweight, rigid and transparent properties make it ideal for
the packaging industry [219,233]. PS is also used in electrical and electronic equipment, and
in construction applications [170,234], composing 6.1% of the plastics demand in Europe [4]
(Table 7).

Polystyrene (PS) 6.1% 150,000–400,000
Due to the high resistance of the C–C backbone [ 235], only a few studies have re-
ported fungi involved in PS biodegradation. The main fungal genera involved in PS
modiﬁcation are the Ascomycetes Rhizopus [236], Aspergillus [236], Penicillium [237] and
Curvularia [238]; the Basidiomycetes white-rot fungi Phanerochaete chrysosporium [236,239],
Trametes versicolor[239] and Pleurotus ostreatus [239]; and the brown-rot fungus Gloeophyllum
trabeum [44].
3.12. Fungal Enzymes Involved in PS Biodegradation
Although some studies have reported fungi involved in PS biodegradation, research
describing fungal enzymes involved in this process are scarce [25,215]. Only an esterase
produced by Lentinus tigrinus has been reported to biodegrade PS ﬁlm into non-toxic
smaller molecules [240]. The optimum activity of this puriﬁed hydrolytic enzyme was
observed at 45 ◦C and pH 9. Moreover, the maximum production reached was 38.62 U/mL
when L. tigrinus was grown in the presence of urea and yeast extract [240].
4. Conclusions and Perspectives for Future Research
Plastic waste is an increasingly urgent environmental problem, and a large amount of
scientiﬁc research has been focused on using microbes for its biodegradation. In this context,
the use of fungal enzymes as bioremediation tools is being increasingly studied. This
review has reported the main fungal enzymes involved in plastic degradation, describing
their characteristics and efﬁciency (Table 8). Fungal ligninolytic enzymes (laccases and
peroxidases), already used in several biotechnological applications, were found to be
successful in partially degrading PE and PVC. Moreover, fungal esterases, such as cutinase
and lipase, were able to degrade PET and PUR. In addition, protease and urease can also
contribute to PUR degradation. On the other hand, there is an absence of studies on fungal
enzymes able to act on PP and PS, which opens the door for further research in this area.
Biochemical methods and tools can be developed for controlling and improving
enzyme catalytic activities and could be applied in several sectors including green chem-
istry [241]. For example, enzyme immobilization is a powerful tool that allows the enzyme
of interest to be conﬁned in a matrix, usually consisting of inert polymers and inorganic
materials [241]. This technique enhances catalytic activity and increases the stability, speci-
ﬁcity and selectivity of the immobilized enzymes, thus signiﬁcantly reducing production
costs [242]. A number of studies have reported that the immobilisation of PET-degrading
bacterial enzymes enhances their catalytic activity and thermal stability [243–245], but few
Microorganisms 2022, 10, 1180 16 of 27
studies have focused on fungi [246]. Su et al. [247] immobilised cutinase from Aspergillus
oryzae, Humicola insolens and Thielavia terrestris on the macroporous support Lewatit VP
OC 1600 obtaining immobilization yields higher than 98%. Enzyme immobilisation is
currently used in the treatment of dye-based wastewater from industries [248], anthracene
degradation [249] and decomposition of the insecticide methyl parathion [250].

A recently emerged research approach to plastic biodegradation by fungal enzymes
is the genetic engineering of fungi involving recombinant DNA technology, gene cloning,
manipulation and modiﬁcation [251]. Such techniques can be used to increase yields and
improve the kinetics of the enzymes produced [252,253]. In the case of bacterial enzymes,
improvement in the PET degradation rate was accomplished by genetic engineering, which
enhanced the enzyme thermostability [ 141,254,255]. Such results were obtained by re-
inforcing the binding of the substrate to the active site [ 256–258], or by improving the
substrate/enzyme surface interaction [259,260]. If similar manipulations could be carried
out of genes coding for key plastic-degrading enzymes, improvements in fungi biodegrada-
tion potential could be achieved. For example, the mutations L81A, N84A, L182A, V184A
and L189A enlarged the active site of the cutinase from Fusarium solani pisi leading to an

improved ﬁtting of the large polymer chains of PET. This modiﬁcation resulted in a ﬁvefold
increase in this cutinase activity [170]. Janatunaim and Fibriani [261] were able to express
the genes of the bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6 coding for the enzyme monohydrox-
yethyl terephthalate hydrolase, which is involved in PET biodegradation, in Escherichia coli
BL21. A similar genetic engineering process was reported for the laccase gene FoLacc5 from
Fusarium oxysporum cDNA. After its expression in Pichia pastoris X33, this methylotroph
yeast was able to easily degrade synthetic blue dyes [262]. Other fungal laccase genes, for
example lac-En3–1 in Ganoderma sp. [263] or genes for Lac in Aspergillus sp. [264], were ex-
pressed in Pichia pastoris GS115 and then used in dye degradation. Although this technique
for plastic degradation is still at the pioneer stage, it appears to produce promising results
and has very high potential [251].
A further step towards biotechnological use of fungal enzymes for plastic degradation
could be achieved using gene editing tools [ 251]. The manipulation of speciﬁc, desired
genes by genome editing allows the loss or gain of a function of interest [265]. However,
very few studies of this kind have been carried out. One example increased the PETase
activity by the inclusion of two conserved residues of the gene coding cutinases from
Thermobiﬁda fusca at the polyesterase active site of the bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis [256].
Therefore, it appears there is a very high potential of this tool to open new avenues for
future research in the area of the genetic editing of fungal enzymes for plastic degradation.
In conclusion, fungal enzymes show high potential in the ﬁght against plastic waste
thanks to their broad biodegradation ability. Currently, most studies are still performed
in vitro under laboratory conditions. Further research is required to better understand the
mechanisms of action of these enzymes and the genetics behind them. These interdisci-
plinary investigations could lead to optimised fungal cell factories with high degradation
efﬁciency and vast industrial applications to help reduce plastic waste pollution and im-
prove the environment.
