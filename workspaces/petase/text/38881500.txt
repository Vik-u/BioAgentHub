Abstract
Carboxylic ester hydrolases with the capacity to degrade polyesters are cur -
rently highly sought after for their potential use in the biological degradation of 
PET and other chemically synthesized polymers. Here, we describe MarCE, a 
carboxylesterase family protein identified via genome mining of a Maribacter 
sp. isolate from the marine sponge Stelligera stuposa . Based on phyloge -
netic analysis, MarCE and its closest relatives belong to marine-  associated 
genera from the Cytophaga–Flavobacterium–Bacteroides taxonomic group 
and appear evolutionarily distinct to any homologous carboxylesterases that 
have been studied to date in terms of structure or function. Molecular dock -
ing revealed putative binding of BHET, a short- chain PET derivative, onto the 
predicted MarCE three-  dimensional structure. The synthetic ester- degrading 
activity of MarCE was subsequently confirmed by MarCE- mediated hydrolysis 
of 2 mM BHET substrate, indicated by the release of its breakdown products 
MHET and TPA, which were measured, respectively, as 1.28 and 0.12 mM 
following 2-  h incubation at 30°C. The findings of this study provide further 
insight into marine carboxylic ester hydrolases, which have the potential to 
display unique functional plasticity resulting from their adaptation to complex 
and fluctuating marine environmentsw.

origins of a given enzyme, which can often provide 
clues regarding its biochemical properties and native 
ecological function (Ogawa & Shimizu, 1999 ; Reen 
et al.,  2015). Although marine ecosystems have be -
come increasingly valued as a source of microbial 
biocatalysts, marine microorganisms and their en -
zymes are still relatively underutilized from a biotech -
nological standpoint, particularly when compared 
to their terrestrial counterparts (Rotter et al., 2021 ). 
Nonetheless, efforts to characterize marine micro -
bial activities have to date proven worthwhile, lead -
ing to an increased diversity in the pool of available 
biocatalysts and the identification of enzymes with 
novel properties including high salt tolerance, tem -
perature adaptivity, barophilicity and unique sub -
strate specificities (Gavin et al., 2019 ; Rodrigues 
et al.,  2017; Trincone, 2017 ). In particular, microbial 
enzymes produced by microorganisms isolated from 
marine sponges are rarely reported on, but repre -
sent a potentially promising biodiscovery resource, 
especially considering the important role they play 
in the degradation of organic matter that is extracted 
by the sponge from the large quantities of seawater 
being pumped through its filter-  feeding structures 
for energy and nutrient gain (de Oliveira et al., 2020; 
Wang, 2006).
The class of enzymes termed carboxylic ester hy -
drolases (CEHs, EC 3.1.1.x) represents a wide range 
of proteins that are ubiquitously distributed across liv -
ing systems and that are known to act on ester and 
ester- linked substrates (Bornscheuer,  2002). Microbial 
CEHs tend to be highly diverse in terms of their bi -
ological roles, with potential involvement in various 
cellular interactions, metabolic processes and signal -
ling pathways (Oh et al., 2019). This multifunctional -
ity can be leveraged for biocatalysis, biodegradation 
and biotransformation purposes, where alternative 
or non-  native substrates can be processed by these 
enzymes. In particular, the degradation of synthetic 
polyesters by microbial CEHs has been explored with 
the aim of developing systems for the biorecycling or 
bioremediation of polyester-  based plastic materials 
(Urbanek et al., 2020 ). Polyester- degrading enzymes, 
collectively referred to as ‘polyesterases’, include 
CEHs homologous to carboxylesterases (CEs), li -
pases and cutinases. Cutinase-  like polyesterases 
have been noted as the most efficient degraders of 
recalcitrant polyesters like polyethylene terephthal -
ate (PET), but dual enzyme-  , synergistic cocktail-  or 
multienzyme cascade-  type strategies have been pro -
posed to further promote the hydrolysis of waste plas -
tic (Gricajeva et al., 2022 ).
Marine microbial CEHs have been identi -
fied and characterized, including examples from 
Pseudoalteromonas , Vibrio, Bacillus , Erythrobacter , 
Pseudomonas  and Oleispira  species together with 
those from metagenomic sources (Lee et al., 2010 ; 
Rodrigues et al., 2017). In a previous study of  
marine metagenomic libraries prepared from crude 
oil- contaminated seawater enrichment cultures, five 
cold-  active, salt-  tolerant carboxylesterases exhib -
ited broad substrate profiles, efficiently hydrolysing a 
range of mono-  and polymeric esters (Tchigvintsev 
et al.,  2015 ). More recently, a carboxylesterase 
named E93 was identified from a marine strain of 
the bacterium Altererythrobacter indicus and investi -
gated in terms of specificity towards CPT11 and NPC 
ester prodrug substrates, together with p - nitrophenyl 
esters; expanding the knowledge of hydrolysis of 
such compounds by microbial enzymes (Li, Rong, 
et al.,  2023 ). In addition, marine-  derived bacterial 
CEHs such as Ple628 and Ple629 (Meyer Cifuentes 
et al., 2022), PE- H (Bollinger et al., 2020) and SM14est 
(Carr et al., 2023) have been shown to hydrolyse 
PET among other polyesters, as reported in the 
plastics-  active enzyme database (PAZy) (Buchholz 
et al., 2022). Based on a metagenomic study, genes 
encoding PET hydrolase homologues in marine-  
associated ecosystems are most commonly detected 
in the phylum Bacteroidota  (Danso et al., 2018) and 
two bacteroidetal PET-  active enzymes, PET27 and 
PET30 were recently characterized in detail (Zhang 
et al., 2022).
Here, we report on a carboxylesterase enzyme 
named MarCE, which was found encoded in the ge -
nome of a marine sponge-  derived Maribacter sp. iso -
late. Comparative analyses of MarCE with homologous 
carboxylesterases that had previously been shown 
to degrade short-  chain oligomers of polyethylene 
terephthalate (PET) and putative docking of the PET 
derivative bis(2-  hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) 
revealed key structural and catalytic components. The 
MarCE protein features a hydrolase domain carrying 
Ser- His- Glu triad residues and a Gly-  Gly oxyanion 
motif, together with two lid domains that are thought 
to mediate substrate specificity. MarCE was heterolo -
gously expressed in Escherichia coli  and confirmed to 
possess BHET- hydrolysing activity. A general overview 
of the work carried out with respect to MarCE is pre -
sented in Figure 1.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Identification and classification of MarCE
The Maribacter sp. strain (sample ID: J2146c) used 
in this study was previously isolated from the sponge 
Stelligera stuposa  sampled at Lough Hyne, Cork, 
Ireland (Jackson et al., 2012 ) and later selected for 
whole- genome sequencing based on its hydrolytic ac -
tivities observed towards tributyrin, polycaprolactone 
diol (PCD) and polycaprolactone (PCL) substrates, 
similar to the approach we recently employed to identify

ACTIVITY
the polyesterase BgP (Carr et al., 2022) (Procedure 2.1 
in Data S1).
Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted with the 
QIAamp® DNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) from 5-  mL cultures 
grown by shaking for 24 h in Marine Broth 2216 at 28°C. 
Illumina HiSeq sequencing (NovaSeq 6000 system), li-
brary preparation and initial quality control were per -
formed by Eurofins Genomics (Konstanz, Germany). 
The Genome Taxonomy Database Toolkit (GTDB- Tk, v 
1.5.0) was used to classify the isolate J2146c (Chaumeil 
et al.,  2020 ). The sequence reads were assembled 
by SPAdes (v 3.15.0) (Bankevich et al., 2012 ) and ini -
tial annotation was performed using Prokka (v 1.14.6) 
(Seemann, 2014), while eggNOG mapper (v 2.0) facili -
tated functional annotation (Huerta-  Cepas et al., 2019) 
(Table S1).
The Maribacter sp. genome was mined for ho -
mologues of known polyester-  degrading enzymes 
using a custom BLASTP database constructed 
from reference sequences using the makeblastdb 
command-  line tool ( Table S2). MarCE was identified 
as a homologue of the carboxylesterase BsEstB. 
It should be noted that while BsEstB was originally 
demonstrated to hydrolyse PET films (120-  h reaction) 
(Ribitsch et al., 2011), a more recent study concluded 
that the Bacillus subtilis carboxylesterase performs 
poorly on polymeric PET following comparative ki -
netic analysis with three cutinase-  like enzymes from 
I. sakaiensis, H. insolens and T.  fusca (24-  h reaction) 
(Bååth et al., 2021 ). In the same study, the B.  subtilis 
carboxylesterase was, however, shown to outperform 
these three PET- degrading enzymes in terms of activ -
ity towards BHET as a substrate. Pfam, InterProScan 
and SUPERFAMILY web tools were used for pro -
tein classification of MarCE, while the SignalP 5.0 
server was used to predict the native MarCE signal 
peptide sequence, which was subsequently removed 
(Almagro Armenteros et al., 2019 ).
Phylogenetic and structural 
protein analyses
MEGA- X and MUSCLE software were employed for 
phylogenetic analysis of MarCE and 46 carboxylester -
ase family homologues (Kumar et al., 2018) (Table S3). 
Alpha- Fold2 (MMseqs2 mode, v1.3.0) was run via 
ColabFold to predict the structure of MarCE (Mirdita 
et al.,  2022 ) ( Figure S1). The model was visualized 
in UCSF Chimera and the Chimera MatchMaker tool 
was used to facilitate structural comparison with hom -
ologues of interest (Pettersen et al., 2004 ). Protein 
structural alignments were generated by T-  COFFEE 
Expresso (Di Tommaso et al., 2011) and graphically ren-
dered using ESPript 3.0 (Gouet et al., 1999) (Figure S2). 
AutoDock Vina (v 1.1.2) was employed to dock BHET 
onto MarCE, with the search box set around the centre 
of the catalytic triad (edge length = 15 Å, exhaustive -
ness = 8). The binding modes were visualized using 
ChimeraX and BIOVIA Discovery Studio. The best- 
scored pose of BHET ( Figure S3) was used as initial 
geometry for molecular mechanics optimization of the 
FIGURE 1  Visual representation of the workflow employed to identify MarCE and verify its BHET-  hydrolysing activity. The marine 
sponge-  derived Maribacter sp. isolate was detected as a potential polyesterase producer during screening. Its' genome was mined for 
polyesterase-  encoding genes and an enzyme designated MarCE was predicted to bind BHET prior to its expression in Escherichia coli  and 
subsequent activity confirmation towards BHET, a short-  chain derivative of the synthetic polymer PET.

2.2 in Data S1).
Heterologous expression and activity 
confirmation
The marCE gene was amplified from gDNA and cloned 
into a pET20b(+) plasmid (Novagen®) and the resulting 
construct was conjugated into E. coli BL21- Codon Plus 
(DE3)- RIPL (Agilent Technologies) ( Figure S4). Fresh 
cultures of the pET20b:MarCE clone and an empty 
vector negative control were induced with 0.5 mM IPTG 
(Melford) for 20 h at 20°C. The cultures were pelleted by 
centrifugation (17,700 × g) for 10 min at 4°C (Beckman 
Coulter, Avanti JXN-  26, JA-  10 rotor). The resulting 
supernatants were analysed by SDS-  PAGE (10% re -
solving gel, 5% stacking gel, tris-  glycine- SDS running 
buffer and 2X β- mercaptoethanol sample buffer) and 
polyesterase activity was tested on PCD (1%) agar 
(Figure S5). MarCE-  containing supernatant and the 
negative control supernatant were stored at −70°C prior 
to further activity analysis.
To assess BHET hydrolysis, supernatants (75 μL) 
were incubated with a 2 mM BHET (Sigma Aldrich) sus-
pension and 25 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5) in a final volume 
of 1 mL at 30°C and 1000 rpm. Reactions were per -
formed in triplicate, with samples taken at 30 min, 1 h 
and 2 h, then quenched by centrifugation (17,000 × g) 
and the addition of an equal volume of 200- mM sodium 
phosphate buffer (pH 2.5, 20% DMSO) to the super -
natant, with samples heat treated at 95°C prior to stor -
age at −20°C. The resulting samples were analysed by 
UHPLC using an Agilent 1260 Infinity II LC System and 
a Kinetex® 5 μm EVO C18 100 Å column, with formic 
acid and acetonitrile employed during the injection of 
3- μL samples. The analytes were separated using a 
flowrate of 1 mL/min for 5 min, where the retention times 
of terephthalic acid (TPA), mono(2-  hydroxyethyl) tere-
phthalate (MHET) and bis(2-  hydroxyethyl) terephthal-
ate (BHET) were 2.4 min, 2.6 and 3.1 min respectively. 
The concentrations of TPA, MHET and BHET were de-
termined against a standard curve of TPA (0–1 mM).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Petroleum- based, non-  biodegradable synthetic plas -
tics have an environmental half-  life that ranges from 
several to a few thousand years. Since PET plas -
tic is employed in packaging and textiles due to its 
strength and physicochemical resistances, PET-  based 
materials are slow to degrade in nature, whether by 
microbial- based or abiotic processes (Li, Menegatti, 
& Crook, 2023 ). The conversion of waste plastics into 
high- purity monomers or value-  added products has 
gained much traction as a way to sustainably manage 
and circularize the life cycle of synthetic materials, with 
biocatalytic approaches of particular interest to enable 
depolymerization under mild reaction conditions (Lee 
et al., 2023). The biological recycling and upcycling of 
PET is viable due to the capacity of polyesterases to 
break the ester bonds that link each polymer subunit 
(Wei et al., 2022 ). Polyester-  hydrolysing biocatalysts 
are innately promiscuous and are also potentially use -
ful for the bioconversion of organic compounds to 
yield valuable pharmaceutical intermediates (Biundo 
et al., 2019; Sanchez & Demain, 2011).
Following enzymatic activity screening, a Maribacter 
sp. strain isolated from a Stelligera stuposa  sponge 
sampled from the marine waters of Lough Hyne was 
noted as a promising polyesterase producer. Its closest 
relative was determined to be Maribacter litoralis using 
the GTDB- Toolkit and a high- quality draft genome was 
assembled, which displayed similar properties to pre -
viously deposited Maribacter spp. genomes. Using an 
E- value cut-  off of 1e-  30, the Maribacter sp. protein- 
coding sequences were mined for polyesterases 
against a custom database composed of functionally 
verified examples, with the top hit producing a signif -
icant alignment with the reference sequence BsEstB. 
T- Coffee Expresso alignment revealed a mean amino 
acid identity of 30.5% between their sequences and a 
mean similarity of 72.9%.
The predicted Maribacter sp. protein was initially 
annotated by Prokka as a ‘fumonisin B1 esterase’, but 
a general NCBI BLASTP search against bacterial en -
tries in the Swiss-  Prot database revealed similar se -
quence identities to other members of the carboxylic 
ester hydrolase (CEH) class of enzymes ( Table S4). 
Based on eggNOG mapper, InterProScan, Pfam and 
SUPERFAMILY outputs, the enzyme was broadly 
classified as an α /β hydrolase belonging to the car -
boxylesterase (CE, EC 3.1.1.1) family, and was desig -
nated as MarCE. According to the Arpigny and Jaegar 
classification scheme for microbial carboxylesterases, 
MarCE belongs to the carboxylesterase family VII 
(Sood et al., 2016). A wider search against the NCBI's 
non- redundant database showed that the closest ho -
mologues of MarCE are other Maribacter spp. car -
boxylesterase family proteins, which share sequence 
identities of up to 97.7% but have not, as of yet, been 
further studied or biochemically characterized in terms 
of their activity or substrate range (Table S4).
The MarCE- producing Maribacter sp. strain was iso-
lated from a marine sponge sampled from Lough Hyne, 
which is a salt- water lake connected to the Celtic Sea of 
the Atlantic Ocean by a narrow tidal channel (Plowman 
et al., 2020). As Europe's first Marine Nature Reserve, 
Lough Hyne is regarded as a biodiversity hotspot, with 
a notable abundance of sponge assemblages across 
its individual habitats that display comparable spe -
cies richness to tropical, polar and temperate sites for 
which similar data are available. This fully marine lake

is subjected to an unusual, but predictable tidally gen -
erated flow regime that is restricted compared to that 
of the open Atlantic coast, which is thought to contrib -
ute to the observed sponge diversity and abundance 
patterns (Bell, 2007). Stelligera stuposa is a species of 
demosponge with robust branching morphologies that 
facilitate enhanced feeding and adaptation, for exam -
ple, to current flow (Bell et al., 2002).
The Genus Maribacter , which belongs to the fam -
ily Flavobacteriaceae of the Phylum Bacteroidota, 
was first described in 2004 and currently consists of 
30 validated species (according to the LPSN collec -
tion, accessed December 2023) (Nedashkovskaya 
et al., 2004). Maribacter species appear to be exclu -
sively associated with marine environments, including 
a diverse range of isolates having been identified from 
seawater (Yoon et al., 2005), algae (Zhang et al., 2020), 
sponge (Jackson et al., 2015 ), deep-  sea sediment 
(Fang et al., 2017 ), seaweed (Weerawongwiwat 
et al.,  2013), Arctic (Cho et al., 2008 ) and Antarctic 
(Zhang et al., 2009 ) sources. To date, the majority of 
published work on the genus Maribacter has been re -
lated to the description of new species, the deposition 
of genomic sequences or their interactions with mac -
roalgae, but with only a small number of Maribacter 
spp. enzymes being specifically characterized, pri -
marily for their ability to degrade polysaccharides (Lee 
et al., 2016; Lu et al., 2022 ). To our knowledge, there 
are no reports describing other types of enzymes from 
Maribacter species, for example, those with activity to -
wards ester and polyester substrates.
Phylogenetic comparison of MarCE with a selection of 
protein homologues suggests some evolutionary diver-
gence between Maribacter spp. carboxylesterase-  type 
enzymes and their closest functionally characterized 
relatives, as indicated by the separation of the resulting 
consensus tree into two distinct clades (labelled 1 and 
2, Figure 2). The first clade features carboxylesterases 
from CFB (Cytophaga, Flavobacterium, Bacteroides) 
group bacteria, which are associated with the phylum 
Bacteroidota and that are considered to be important 
contributors to the degradation of marine organic mat -
ter (Brettar et al., 2004 ). The second clade features 
reference carboxylesterases (i.e. those sourced from 
Swissprot or PDB databases for which experimental or 
structural data is available, or that have been previously 
studied in the literature).
MarCE is found in clade 1a with proteins from 
Maribacter litoralis (marine sediment-  derived strain) 
and Maribacter caenipelagi as its closest relatives, 
while sister groups are formed primarily by en -
tries from other members of the Maribacter genus 
but also featuring sequences from Saonia flava of 
the Flavobacteriaceae Family and Fulvivirga sed -
imenti of the class Cytophagia ( Figure 2). The clade 
1b consists of Flavobacteriaceae sequences exclu -
sively belonging to marine-  associated Genera ( Pricia, 
Eudoraea, Euzebyella and Maribacter spp.) (Siamphan 
et al., 2015; Yu et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2017) or in 
one case, coming from a marine- derived metagenomic 
sample. The proteins in clade 1c each belong to the 
Cytophagia class of bacteria, featuring genera that 
are not specific to the marine environment ( Arcicella, 
Emticicia and Runella spp.), which are instead associ -
ated with terrestrial, freshwater or wastewater samples 
(Nikitin et al., 2004; Ten et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2020). 
The carboxylesterases clustered in clade 2 of the phy -
logenetic tree represent publicly available reference se-
quences, which share relatively low levels of homology 
(<35% amino acid identity) with MarCE, but which have 
been previously studied in the context of their function 
and/or structure. Protein sequences from the species 
Thermobifida fusca  and the family Bacillaceae form 
2a and 2b, respectively, while the remainder are as -
signed to the Phyla Actinomycetota (R. erythropolis and 
P. oxydans), Alphaproteobacteria ( S. macrogoltabida 
and A. indicum) or Bacillota ( H. hathewayi). TfCa from 
Thermobifida fusca KW3 (clade 2a) has proven useful 
as a secondary biocatalyst for polyester degradation in 
combination with PET hydrolases such as TfCut2 and 
LC- cutinase (Barth et al., 2016).
Microbial enzymes which have been shown to depo-
lymerize PET and other polyesters, such as polycapro-
lactone, PBSA (poly(butylene succinate-  co- adipate)), 
PBAT (polybutylene adipate terephthalate) and polylac-
tic acid (Hajighasemi et al., 2016; Li, Rong, et al., 2023; 
Wu et al., 2023), may be broadly classified as carboxylic 
ester hydrolases (CEHs, EC 3.1.1.x). Of these, cutinase 
family members (EC 3.1.1.74) are currently considered 
the most efficient degraders of PET; however, the asso-
ciated reaction does not typically result in the full hydro-
lysis of the polyester to its constituent monomers (i.e. 
terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG)) and 
instead, there tends to be an accumulation of MHET 
and BHET intermediates which are not as easily de -
polymerized by cutinases (Schubert et al., 2023 ). By 
comparison, members of the carboxylesterase family 
(CEs, EC 3.1.1.1) exhibit poor activity towards polymeric 
PET but seem to be more accommodating of shorter 
PET fragments (Bååth et al., 2021).
BsEstB and TfCa are two carboxylesterases known 
to act on PET oligomers. While MarCE shares slightly 
higher amino acid similarity values to BsEstB than it 
does with TfCa (72.90% vs. 70.76%), the latter has 
been studied in greater detail as a (tere)phthalate- 
ester hydrolase that acts on oligo- ester substrates (von 
Haugwitz et al., 2022 ). Thus, TfCa from Thermobifida 
fusca was selected for comparison with MarCE. 
Following structure- based amino acid sequence align -
ment, MarCE was found to share a mean similarity 
of 70.76% with TfCa and a mean identity of 27.08% 
(Figure S2). Based on its characterization, TfCa is not 
considered to be active on PET alone, but this carbox -
ylesterase can promote PET hydrolysis in combination

ACTIVITY
with PET-  degrading enzymes and substrate profiling 
has revealed that TfCa is active on MHET and BHET 
(i.e. the breakdown products of PET), as well as 3PET 
(bis[2- (benzoyloxy) ethyl]) terephthalate and DEP (di -
ethyl phthalate) oligomers (von Haugwitz et al., 2022 ). 
Therefore, we do not expect MarCE to display any 
significant activity towards PET, and we have instead 
investigated MarCE as a potential terephthalate-  ester 
hydrolase.
During its characterization, TfCa was demonstrated 
to degrade BHET, among other short-  chain synthetic 
ester substrates (von Haugwitz et al., 2022). Molecular 
docking of BHET as a ligand onto MarCE demon -
strated putative binding (−5.8  kcal/mol), whereby the 
substrate fits comfortably into a pocket region on the 
enzyme's surface (Figure S3). The molecular mechan-
ics of the MarCE:BHET complex were optimized and 
the residues of the main substrate binding pocket of 
MarCE were deduced, with the nucleophilic Ser198, 
the oxyanion hole-  forming Gly113 and the amphoteric 
His432 present for ester bond hydrolysis ( Figure 3A). 
Based on comparison with TfCa, there are differences 
in some key residues at the same position, for example, 
Phe73, Gly113, Ile202 and Phe277 in MarCE equates 
to Ile69, Ala108, Met189 and Leu282 in TfCa respec -
tively (Table S5).
The superimposition of the MarCE predicted struc -
ture onto the elucidated crystal structure for TfCa 
revealed a similar overall structure for these two en -
zymes consisting of a core α /β hydrolase domain and 
two lid domains ( Figure 3B). The hydrolase portion of 
MarCE features a mixed β - sheet composed of 12 full 
strands, seven of which run parallel in the centre with 
inversion at either end where the structure runs in anti- 
parallel. In general, anti-  parallel β - sheets are thought 
to contribute increased flexibility over the parallel con -
formation (Emberly et al., 2004 ). Structural and spatial 
differences were observed between the two enzymes, 
for example, in the helical lid domains and in variable 
loop regions. The loops carrying the catalytic triad and 
oxyanion residues are more highly conserved, as is gen-
erally the case for α /β hydrolase superfamily members 
(Mindrebo et al., 2016). In general, the functionality and 
substrate range of each CEH depends on the structural 
configuration of their catalytic centres and the individual 
amino acids contributing to substrate binding and catal-
ysis, with minor differences in sequence often having a 
major effect on activity for highly similar enzymes and 
variants (Leitão & Enguita, 2021; Ribitsch et al., 2017). 
Given that MarCE is derived from a marine mesophilic 
organism and TfCa is a thermophilic enzyme of terres -
trial origin, differences in activity and substrate scope 
are likely to be observed upon functional comparison of 
the two enzymes (Crnjar et al., 2023).
Following heterologous expression by E. coli, MarCE 
(58 kDa) was detected from culture supernatant by

SDS- PAGE and the enzyme preparation, which was 
found to be relatively pure, was confirmed as active 
on PCD substrate plates ( Figure S5). The MarCE- 
containing supernatant displayed BHET-  hydrolysing 
activity at 30°C, with levels of available BHET decreas-
ing over time ( Figure 4). MHET was detected as the 
primary product of BHET hydrolysis by MarCE, where 
MHET levels were shown to increase with time. In addi-
tion, further degradation of MHET into monomers was 
observed, as indicated by the detection of TPA, which 
again increased over time. For the empty vector nega -
tive control sample, no conversion of BHET to TPA was 
observed (data not presented). The study of enzymatic 
PET degradation has been largely focused on cutinase 
homologues, which can accommodate and process 
polymeric PET, while the complementary role of car -
boxylesterases and their diversity have been explored 
to a lesser extent (Gricajeva et al., 2022; von Haugwitz 
et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2023). Thus, the degradation of 
PET derivatives by the marine carboxylesterase MarCE 
offers new insight into synthetic ester hydrolysis in gen-
eral, and particularly within the unique context of the 
marine environment. Given that MarCE was shown to 
liberate TPA monomers from BHET, this enzyme could 
potentially be used in combination with PET-  active 
polyesterases to facilitate the complete degradation of 
PET into its simplest constituent units.
CONCLUSION
In this work, we present the marine-  derived carboxy -
lesterase MarCE and its terephthalate ester-  degrading 
activity, as demonstrated by the hydrolysis of BHET, 
an intermediate breakdown product of the polyester 
PET. Taking into consideration the true marine origin 
of this Maribacter sp. enzyme, combined with its overall 
homology to functionally characterized carboxylester -
ases, we believe that MarCE represents a novel ad -
dition to the current selection of microbial enzymes 
of interest for synthetic polyester degradation and the 
sustainable catalysis of organic synthesis reactions. 
Furthermore, the identification of MarCE contributes to 
our overall knowledge of marine carboxylic ester hydro-
lases and this enzyme may find use as a versatile bio -
catalyst for use in green chemistry applications. Finally, 
Maribacter species may represent a promising source 
of novel CEHs that are distinctly adapted to the marine 
environment, whose discovery could help to expand 
and diversify the selection of enzymes available for bio-
logical recycling among other biocatalytic applications.
