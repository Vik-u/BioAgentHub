Plastic waste, particularly polyethylene terephthalate (PET), presents sig-
niﬁcant environmental challenges, driving extensive research into enzymatic
biodegradation. However, existing PET hydrolases (PETases) are limited by
narrow sequence diversity and suboptimal performance. This study intro-
duces VenusMine, a protein discovery pipeline that integrates protein lan-
guage models (PLMs) with a representation tree to identify PETases based on
structural similarity using sequence information. Using the crystal structure of
IsPETase as a template,VenusMine identiﬁes and clusters target proteins.
Candidates are further screened using PLM-based assessments of solubility
and thermostability, leading to the selection of 34 proteins for biochemical
validation. Results reveal that 14 candidates exhibit PET degradation activity
across 30–60 °C. Notably, a PET hydrolase fromKibdelosporangium ban-
guiense (KbPETase) demonstrates amelting temperature (T
m)3 2° Ch i g h e r
than IsPETase and exhibits the highest PET degradation activity within 30–
65 °C among wild-type PETases.KbPETase also surpasses FastPETase and LCC
in catalytic efﬁciency. X-ray crystallography and molecular dynamics simula-
tions show thatKbPETase possesses a conserved catalytic domain and
enhanced intramolecular interactions, underpinning its improved function-
ality and thermostability. This workdemonstrates a novel deep learning
approach for discovering natural PETases with enhanced properties.
Plastic waste poses serious risks to human health and the envir-
onment, contributing to pollution, toxic chemical exposure, and
ecosystem disruption
1– 3. Recycling plastic is therefore essential to
mitigate these negative impacts, conserve natural resources, and
reduce environmental contamination. Polyethylene terephthalate
(PET), one of the most widely used plastics, has already been
extensively utilized in packaging, textiles, and various consumer
products
4. Due to its durability and extensive use, PET
accumulation in landﬁlls and natural ecosystems has become a
signiﬁcant environmental issue 1,2,5. Traditional mechanical and
chemical recycling methods for PET are limited in both efﬁciency
and environmental sustainability 6– 8. As a result, developing bio-
logical solutions for PET degradation, particularly through the use
of hydrolase enzymes to product high-quality recycled PET (rPET),
has obtained signiﬁcant attention from both scientiﬁc research
and industry
9– 18.

Multiple enzymes capable of degrading PET have been bio-
chemically and structurally identiﬁed and characterized19–23. The most
effective PET-degrading enzymes to date are derived from culturable
microorganisms isolated from environmental microbial communities,
such as the widely usedIdeonella sakaiensisPET hydrolase (IsPETase)
12.
However, approximately 99% of microbial species in nature are
unculturable, making metagenomic data a crucial resource for dis-
covering new enzymes
24. Successes in thisﬁeld include the identiﬁca-
tion of leaf and branch compost cutinase (LCC)19,P H L - 7( P E S - H 1 )22,25,
PE-H26, Bacterium HR29 (BhrPETase)21,a n dThermobiﬁda fusca cuti-
nases (TfCut1 andTfCut2)20. Recently, a thermophilic PET-degrading
enzyme, MG8, was discovered from human saliva metagenomic data23.
Despite these advancements, the performance of these wild-type (WT)
PETases remains insufﬁcient for industrial PET enzymatic hydrolysis.
Industrial-scale PET biodegradation requires high-temperature condi-
tions to achieve high yields of rPET
27,28, as temperatures approaching
PET’s glass transition release molecular energy, facilitating PETase-
catalyzed hydrolysis18,29–34. However, WT PETases are limited by low
catalytic activity and thermostability10,31,35. Therefore, discovering new
WT PETase with high catalytic activity and thermostability are crucial
for advancing PETase engineering for the PET biodegradation industry.
The discovery of functional proteins is crucial for advancing both
biotechnology and the life sciences
36. Sequence-based screening
remains the most widely used approach for enzyme discovery36,37,
leading to the identiﬁcation of enzymes such as LCC19 and MG823.
Although sequence-based methods-such as identifying conserved
residues, sequence similarities, or hidden Markov models (HMMs)-are
effective, proteins with similar functions may still go undetected when
rely solely on sequence information
38. Conversely, because the three-
dimensional (3D) structure of a protein largely dictates its function,
structure-based discovery offers a more robust approach, yielding a
more diverse repertoire for enzyme mining
39,40. While structural data
in public databases remains limited41,42, deep learning methods,
including AlphaFold43, have shown great promise in accurately pre-
dicting protein 3D structures, enabling the large-scale exploration and
classiﬁcation of proteins with structure queries.
In this study, we develop VenusMine, a structure-based enzyme
discovery pipeline integrating sequence/structure retrieval tools and
protein language models to identify thermostable PETases. Through
systematic screening of 34 selected candidates using VenusMine, we
identify 14 active PETases, including 8 with a melting temperature
10 °C higher thanIsPETase and 3 demonstrating signiﬁcantly enhanced
catalytic activity. Notably, PETase fromKibdelosporangium banguiense
(KbPETase) exhibits exceptional properties, with a T
m 32 °C higher
than IsPETase and catalytic activity at 50 °C that outperformsIsPETase
and LCC under their optimal reaction conditions.KbPETase also dis-
plays enhanced catalytic efﬁciency (kcat/KM) compared to FastPETase
and LCC. Overall, we establish a structure-based enzyme mining
approach combined with protein language models, which is both
reliable and sensitive for identifying and screening candidate PETase,
thereby accelerating the discovery of high-performance enzymes.
Results
VenusMine: A structure-base enzyme discovery pipeline
Our structure-based enzyme discovery pipeline for PETase consists of
two primary stages (Fig.1a). First, we aimed to compile a compre-
hensive collection of potential PETases sharing structural similarity
with known enzymes. Starting withIsPETase as the query structure
(PDB: 5XFY
44), we utilized the structure search tool FoldSeek45 to
perform structure similarity searches (see details in Methods). Given
that structure databases are still limited (e.g., AFDB and ESMAtlas), we
used the identiﬁed proteins as queries to conduct an extensive
sequence search through the NCBI NR sequence database using
MMseqs2 (see details in Methods). This approach resulted in a vast
repertoire of 33,247,501 candidates, which could cover almost all
potential PETases that share a similar structure to our query protein,
IsPETase (Fig. 1b). This approach resulted in a vast repertoire of
33,247,501 candidates and kept 436,488 after 50% sequence identity
clustering, which could cover almost all potential PETases that share a
similar structure to our query protein,IsPETase (Fig.1b).
The second stage of the pipeline clusters candidate proteins to
identify those most likely to exhibit optimal functionality and desired
characteristics. Here, we utilized the sequence embeddings from the
protein language model ProstT5
46 to represent the proteins. To reduce
computational cost, we used representative sequences from 50%
identity sequence clusters to calculate embeddings for subsequent
analysis. ProstT5 has learned a mapping from protein sequences to
structures, effectively representing the proteins in the structure space.
This means that proteins with closer embeddings in Euclidean space
are more likely to share similar structures. Subsequently, agglom-
erative clustering was applied to the protein embeddings to group the
candidate enzymes and build a representation tree (Fig.1c, d). To
elucidate the functions and characteristics of each cluster, a list of well-
studied enzymes with annotations are clustered together for com-
parison. The agglomerative clusters enabled us to pinpoint the most
promising clade for PET degradation activity, which contains more
conﬁrmed PETase, while others contained enzymes from different EC
numbers (Fig.1d).
For further screening, we selected two clusters (cluster 1 and 3), as
these clusters contained all reported high-activity wild-type PETases
(e.g., IsPETase, LCC, TFH). A full list of known PETases within these
clusters is provided in Supplementary Data 2. These clusters under-
went multi-tiered screening: (1) Aﬁne-tuned ESM2
47,48 model predicted
Tm, with sequences demonstratingTm larger than that ofIsPETase
retained; (2) ProtSolM49 eliminated candidates with low solubility
predictions; (3) ESMfold-predicted structures were aligned withIsPE-
Tase (PDB:5XFY) using TM-align, excluding proteins with TM-score
below 0.5 or sequences exhibiting catalytic triad mismatches. Finally,
the 34 top-ranked candidates by predictedT
m were ﬁnally selected for
experimental validation, balancing computational predictions with
practical experimental throughput constraints (Supplementary Fig. 1).
This hierarchical approach ensured systematic identiﬁcation of ther-
mostable, soluble candidates while preserving structuralﬁdelity to
functional PETase architectures.
Characterizations of putative PET hydrolases
We analyzed the sequences of 34 candidates to identify signal peptides
using SignalP, followed by truncation to enhance expression efﬁciency
(Supplementary Figs. 2–3)
50,51. After codon optimization (Supplemen-
tary Data 1), the modiﬁed sequences were cloned into the pET28a (+)
vector and expressed inE. coliBL21(DE3) with an N-terminal His-tag for
puriﬁcation. Among the candidates, 26 were successfully expressed
and puriﬁed. The high expression success rate can also be attributed to
the effective pre-screening capabilities of the PLM in the initial selec-
tion process. Thep-nitrophenyl butyrate (pNPB) molecule contains an
ester bond, and PETase similarly catalyzes the cleavage of ester bonds
in PET (Supplementary Fig. 4). Therefore, we employedpNPB as a
substrate to rapidly assess ester bond hydrolysis activity by measuring
the absorbance of the reaction product, a method widely utilized in
PETase discovery and related research
12,18,19,33,52,53(Supplementary
Figs. 4 and 5). After incubating proteins with substrates at 37 °C, 14
of the 26 expressible proteins exhibited ester bond-cleaving
activity (Fig.2a).
To evaluate PET degradation performance
50, we used commer-
cially available amorphous PETﬁlm (AF-PET, Goodfellow Cambridge
Ltd, Cat. No. ES301445) as the substrate, which is widely used for
assessing PET degradation activity13,54. The aromatic reaction products
mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) and terephthalic acid
(TPA) were quantiﬁed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromato-
graphy (UPLC)
13. For comparative analysis, we usedIsPETase, the

reference protein in our structural searches, as a control baseline.
Since the optimal catalytic temperatures of the enzymes were
unknown, we tested the activity of the 14 candidates across a range of
30−60 °C. All proteins exhibited activity within this range, with 11 of
the 14 displaying degradation activity comparable toIsPETase (Fig.2c).
Given that T
m is an indicator of PETase thermostability and
performance11, we used differential scanningﬂuorimetry (DSF) to
determine the Tm of the proteins. The results showed that the Tm of the
14 proteins ranged from 36.4 °C to 80.1 °C (Fig.2b), with eight candi-
dates demonstrating superior thermostability compared to theIsPE-
Tase, indicating the VenusMine ’s effectiveness in identifying
thermostable and functional PETases. We also observed that the three
aforementioned properties exhibited low correlations (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 6), highlighting the complexity of PETase activity and sug-
gesting that multiple factors likely contribute to overall degradation
performance. However, the PLM was able to capture relevant features,
enabling high-positive screening of candidate PETases.
Notably, APET-14 showed the highest catalytic activity at 50 °C,
with a 97-fold increase compared toIsPETase at 30 °C (Fig.2c). and
demonstrated excellent thermostability, with a T
m increase of 32.4 °C
over IsPETase, as validated by nanoDSC (Supplementary Fig. 7). These
results indicate that APET-14 (GenBank: WP_209642273.1, PETase from
Kibdelosporangium banguiense
55, hereafterKbPETase) combines high
enzymatic activity and thermostability, traits essential for efﬁcient PET
degradation, and was thus selected for further evaluation. In addition,
the sequence similarity betweenKbPETase and other known PETases
ranges from 30% to 50%, highlighting the capability of VenusMine to
identify functional PETase in regions of low sequence similarity (Sup-
plementary Fig. 8).
Identiﬁcation ofKbPETase exhibiting high PET hydrolytic
activity and thermostability

Thc_Cut157 (thermophilic), TFH58 (thermophilic), and LCC19 (thermo-
philic), across a temperature range of 30−65 °C (Fig.3a). Note that
Cut190, IsPETase, LCC, and PE-H are used as superior starting tem-
plates for directed evolution in industry18.
Compared toIsPETase, which exhibits the highest catalytic activ-
ity at room temperature moderate temperatures with its optimal cat-
alytic activity at 30 °C
12, KbPETase demonstrates a 97-fold higher
catalytic activity at its optimal temperature of 50 °C. (Fig.3a). To assess
thermostability, we analyzed the Tm of KbPETase and other enzymes,
ﬁnding that its enhanced activity likely correlates with its superior
thermostability (Fig.3b). Time-dependent PET degradation further
revealed the stability ofKbPETase, with continuous activity enhance-
ment over time, unlikeIsPETase, which plateaued after 24 h at 30 °C
(Supplementary Fig. 9). Compared to LCC, a highly active thermophilic
PETase
19, KbPETase exhibits 5.7-fold higher activity under the same
reaction conditions at 50 °C, and even outperformed LCC by 1.47-fold
at its optimal temperature of 65 °C (Fig.3a) (Fig.3a), despite the fact

that higher temperatures closer to PET glass transition temperature
can facilitate faster degradation7,18,27,32. This superiority persisted when
LCC was tested in its optimal 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH
8.0) at 65 °C, withKbPETase at 50 °C maintaining 1.15-fold higher
activity (Supplementary Fig. 10). In addition, the degradation products
of KbPETase exhibited a slightly higher proportion of TPA (Fig.3d), a
critical factor for PET recycling
27,59. However, when we tested the
Michaelis-Menten constants33, we found that while the Km values were
similar, KbPETase exhibited a 1.5-fold higherkcat and a 1.3-fold higher
catalytic efﬁciency (kcat/KM)c o m p a r e dt oL C C( F i g .3ca n dT a b l e1).
These ﬁndings indicate that KbPETase combines the moderate-
temperature catalytic efﬁciency typical of mesophilic enzymes with
the elevated activity characteristic of thermophilic counterparts.
We also compared the performance ofKbPETase with FastPETase,
t h em o s ta c t i v em u t a n td e r i v e df r o mIsPETase, known for its optimal
catalytic performance also at 50 °C54.KbPETase exhibits a Tm that is 8 °C
higher than that of FastPETase. Evaluation of PET degradation activity
across a temperature gradient revealed thatKbPETase demonstrated
1.71-fold higher activity than FastPETase at their shared optimal tem-
perature (Supplementary Fig. 11). To investigate the underlying reasons
for this difference, we also determined the Michaelis-Menten kinetic
constants of both enzymes usingpNPB as a substrate
33. KbPETase
demonstrates a 1.87-fold higher catalytic efﬁciency compared to Fas-
tPETase, along with superior substrate afﬁnity (Fig.3ca n dT a b l e1).
Besides, KbPETase produced TPA at a concentration that is 2.2-fold
higher than that ofFastPETase (Fig.3d). However, when compared to
the engineered variant LCCICCG, KbPETase exhibited comparable activity
at 50 °C, achieving approximately half of the optimal catalytic activity of
LCC
ICCG (Supplementary Fig. 12)16. These results suggest thatKbPETase
could serve as a more promising template for enzyme engineering
compared to other WT enzymes, such asIsPETase and LCC, which
exhibit extreme mesophilic or thermophilic traits.
Sequence and structure analysis ofKbPETase
To provide structural insights into the enhanced PET-degrading
activity ofKbPETase, we determined its structure using X-ray crystal-
lography at a resolution of 1.75 Å (PDB: 9IW9). Overall, the structure of
KbPETase exhibits a high degree of conservation compared toIsPETase
(PDB: 5XH3) (Fig.4a). The catalytic triad (S128-H206-D176) and sub-
strate pocket ofKbPETase are also conserved relative to those of
IsPETase (S131-H208-D177) (Fig.4b and c). This conservation suggests
that VenusMine not only retains the overall structure scaffold but also
preserves the active site, ensuring the enzymatic activity necessary for
PET degradation.
A phylogenetic tree was constructed to include APET candidates
alongside known PETases (Fig. 4d). The discovered enzymes are
broadly distributed throughout the tree. One major clade contains
most known PETases, includingIsPETase, LCC, Cut190, and Thc_cut1,

from whichKbPETase also originates. Furthermore, several new clades
emerged, populated by APET candidates positioned closer to the root
of the phylogenetic tree. This arrangement suggests that VenusMine
may effectively identify ancestral enzymes based on conserved struc-
tural features.
To further investigate the substrate pocket, structure alignment
was performed using TM-align. Compared with reported PETases, the
newly discovered APETs exhibit greater diversity in pocket residues
while retaining a conserved catalytic triad (Fig.4e–g). Notably, resi-
dues at positions 58, 129, and 155 show higher variability than those of
known PETases (Fig.4e, f). Hierarchical clustering based on pocket
residues revealed that APETs are distributed across all major types of
known PETases.
Molecular dynamics analysis ofKbPETase
To elucidate the molecular basis ofKbPETase’se n h a n c e dt h e r m o -
stability, we performed comparative all-atom molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations with LCC andIsPETase, representing thermophilic
and mesophilic PET hydrolases, respectively. Analysis of the radius of
gyration (Rg) distributions (Fig.5a–c) revealed thatKbPETase pre-
dominantly adopts conformations with signiﬁcantly reduced Rg values
compared to LCC andIsPETase. This structural compactness correlates
with its experimental thermostability, suggesting that reduced con-
formational entropy minimizes thermal unfolding propensity-a hall-
mark of enzymes adapted toﬂuctuating environmental conditions.
Root mean squareﬂuctuation (RMSF) proﬁles further highlighted
critical differences in localﬂexibility (Fig.5d–f). While LCC andIsPE-
Tase exhibited pronounced dynamics in loop regions proximal to their
catalytic pockets (highlighted as yellow sticks),KbPETase demon-
strated restrictedﬂexibility in these functionally critical regions, with
elevated ﬂuctuations conﬁned to peripheral N-terminal loops. This
dichotomy suggests that KbPETase achieves a balance between
global stability and localﬂexibility, potentially optimizing both sub-
strate accessibility and catalytic efﬁciency across a broad tempera-
ture range.
Analysis of non-covalent interactions revealed hierarchical trends
in intramolecular stabilization (Fig.5g–i). LCC, the most thermostable
enzyme, maintained the highest global counts of salt bridges and
hydrogen bonds, followed byKbPETase andIsPETase. This gradient
mirrors their experimentalT
m, underscoring the role of cumulative
non-bonded interactions in conferring thermostability. To further
identify the critical hydrogen bonds in the catalytic pocket of the three
proteins, we calculated the lifetime of every individual hydrogen bond
within active sites (Details can be found in the section of Method).
Notably, hydrogen bond lifetimes within the catalytic pocket— a metric
reﬂecting bond persistence — showed KbPETase surpassing both
counterparts, with the N175-D205 interaction exhibiting the longest
lifetime (τ = 5.00 ± 0.21 ns, Supplementary Fig. 13). Such prolonged
hydrogen bonding may stabilize the catalytic triad geometry, facil-
itating substrate orientation and transition-state stabilization.

These ﬁndings collectively delineate the biophysical signature of
KbPETase: a compact scaffold resistant to entropic unfolding, paired
with dynamic yet stable active site interactions. This dual strategy—
global rigidity tempered by localizedﬂexibility— may explain its unique
functional proﬁle, balancing thermostability with catalytic efﬁciency.
By circumventing the traditional trade-off between thermal resilience
and ambient-temperature activity observed in extremophilic enzymes,
KbPETase emerges as a versatile candidate for PET depolymerization
processes requiring operational adaptability.
Discussion
The increasing environmental impact of plastic waste, particularly PET,
underscores the urgent need for innovative and effective biodegrada-
tion strategies
5,8,11,28. Consequently, the search for promising PET-
degrading enzymes has been widely pursued, leading to the successful
characterization of several proteins to date12,18–21,23. However, current
enzyme discovery methods predominantly rely on sequence-based
analysis and are constrained by the high costs of experimental bio-
chemical or biophysical protein structure characterization, as well as the
limited accuracy of traditional computational folding simulations
60,61.
This reliance limits PETase discovery to a narrow sequence landscape50.
Here, we present VenusMine, a structure-guided pipeline inte-
grating FoldSeek-based structural searches, ProstT5-driven clustering,
and deep learning-aided thermostability/solubility predictions. This
methodology expands enzyme mining beyond sequence homology,
enabling the discovery ofKbPETase. KbPETase demonstrates remark-
able catalytic performance, exhibiting superior activity at 50 °C, which
establishes it as a highly practical candidate for industrial PET recy-
cling. Structural and molecular dynamics analyses reveal a conserved
catalytic architecture and strengthened intramolecular interactions,
underpinning its enhanced thermostability and functional resilience.
In contrast to engineered variants like FastPETase,KbPETase’sw i l d -
type origin and unoptimized catalytic efﬁciency present a promising
starting point for directed evolution, offering substantial potential for
further reﬁnement and application.
VenusMine not only expands the repertoire of known PETases but
also establishes a robust framework for future enzyme discovery. With
advancements in deep learning and protein language models, it may
soon be possible to predict protein structures, and even complexes,
more accurately, enabling the preliminary selection of candidate pro-
teins through modeling. This approach not only aids in identifying
exceptional enzyme molecules akin to“hidden gems” within databases
but also enhances the accuracy and precision of the screening process.
The emergence ofKbPETase provides an improved template for the
engineering of high-performance enzymes, expanding the molecular
library and offering new tools for the bioconversion and recycling of PET.
Methods
Structure search
In the structural search step, we utilized the default setting of the
FoldSeek server website (https://search.foldseek.com/search). The
structure ofIsPETase (PDB: 5XFY) is selected as the only query protein
for the FoldSeek search. Target structure database include AlphaFold
databases (UniProt50 v4, SwissProt v4, Proteome v4), MGnify-ESM30
(v1), PDB100, and GMGCL 2204.The core structure is deﬁned by a
manual structure check ofIsPETase, ranging from residue 51 to 234,
covering the reported catalytic triad and the scaffold of the PET
hydrolase. Any searched protein align range not covering this region
was excluded from the following steps. This structure search step
identiﬁed 4235 structural similar protein sequences. The Code of this
part is available at step 2 inhttps://github.com/ai4protein/VenusMine.
Sequence search
In the sequence search step, the sequences found in the structure
search from different databases were merged and used as queries for
the sequence search through the NCBI’s NR database. This step is using
MMseqs2 easy-search method with 2 rounds of iterations and sets
max-seq to 2500, resulting in 33,247,501 sequences. After obtaining
this vast repertoire, MMseqs2 easy-cluster method with 50% sequence
identity is used to saving the cost for the following ProstT5 embed-
dings computation step. Resulting 436,488 representative proteins
derived from 50% sequence identity clusters. Code for this part is
available at steps 3 and 4 inhttps://github.com/ai4protein/VenusMine.
Benchmarking protein language models for protein discovery
We systematically evaluated various computational approaches to
assess their effectiveness in identifying and classifying proteins within
enzyme commission (EC) groups, in order toﬁnd the optimal and most
efﬁcient method to discover novel enzymes. Utilizing a curated dataset
of 265,488 protein sequences from the reviewed UniProt database
(SwissProt), we focused on proteins up to 1000 amino acids in length
and EC numbers with no less than 50 annotated enzymes. Our
benchmarking compared traditional methods, including BLASTp and
MMseqs2 for sequence similarity and FoldSeek with AlphaFold pre-
dictions for structural alignment against protein language models such
as ESM-2 650 M, ESM-1b, and ProstT5. For each EC number, 10 starting
points were randomly selected from the candidate pool, while other
enzymes with annotated EC number as positive examples, enzymes
without target EC number serve as negative examples. By calculating
E-value for BLASTp, MMseqs2 and FoldSeek, and representation dis-
tances for protein language models, we are able to analyze the area
under the ROC curve (AUROC) and area under precision-recall curve
(AUPR) scores for 745 EC groups. This comprehensive evaluation
provided insights into the strengths and limitations of each approach,
highlighting the potential of protein language models in enhancing
protein discovery and classiﬁcation tasks. Results showed that both
the structure-based methods FoldSeek and ProstT5 performed better
than BLASTp methods, and ProstT5 is the only unsupervised deep-
learning method that performed better than BLASTp (Supplementary
Figs. 14–17). As a result, we select the structure-aware language model
ProstT5 for our further studies.
Clustering and representation tree built by structure-aware
protein language model
We use the protein sequence-to-structure language model ProstT5 to
calculate the embeddings of the protein candidates’sequences. Since
ProstT5 is a bi-directional translation model between protein sequence
and structure, the“AA2fold” mode of ProstT5 model is used to get a
more structure-informed representation based on input sequences.
Based on the representation of multiple sequences, we used agglom-
erative clustering to build a dendrogram for the sequences. The dis-
tances between representations are calculated as the Euclidean
distance, and the agglomerative clustering method is using ward
algorithm from scipy.cluster.hierarchy package. The code of this part
is available at steps 5 and 6 in https://github.com/ai4protein/
VenusMine.
Protein expression and solubility prediction
Within the 2 selected cluster in representation tree, there are
6763 sequences advanced to the next screening step. We used aﬁne-
tuned version of the ESM247 to predict the melting temperature (Tm)o f
the candidates using datasets from the literature48.I na d d i t i o n ,w e
employed ProtSolM to predict protein solubility49. Only candidates
with predicted Tm and solubility values exceeding those of the query
sequence were retained, narrowing the pool to 223 sequences.
Protein structure prediction and selection for APET
For further reﬁnement, the structures of the 223 sequences were
predicted using AlphaFold262, and any sequence with a pLDDT score
below 75 was discarded. Structural alignment was then performed to
Article https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-025-61599-z
Nature Communications|         (2025) 16:6211 8
ensure that the candidate proteins possessed the catalytic active site
necessary for PET hydrolase activity. Finally, the candidates were
ranked by their predicted T
m values, and the top 34 sequences were
selected for wet-lab validation.
Plasmid construction
The genes encoding APET1-34 were synthesized and optimized for
expression (Supplementary Data 1) inEscherichia coliby Sangon Bio-
tech (Shanghai, China). Signal peptides for APET1-34 were predicted
using SignalP and subsequently removed from the synthetic DNA
sequences. The synthesized genes for APET1-34 were then cloned into
the NdeIa n dNotI sites of the pET-28a (+) expression vector, which
features an N-terminal His-tag for protein puri ﬁcation. Detailed
nucleotide sequences of APET1-34 are provided in Supplemen-
tary Data 1.
Protein expression and puriﬁcation
The expression plasmid was transformed into Escherichia coli
BL21(DE3) competent cells. A 30 mL seed culture was grown at 37 °C in
LB medium containing 50µg/mL kanamycin, and then transferred to a
500 mL shakerﬂask containing the same antibiotic concentration. The
cultures were incubated at 37 °C until the OD600 reached 1.0, at which
point protein expression was induced by the addition of isopropyl-β-D-
thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a ﬁnal concentration of 0.8 mM.
Induction was followed by incubation at 16 °C for 16–20 h. Cells were
harvested by centrifugation at 3345 ×g for 30 min, and the resulting
pellets were collected for subsequent puriﬁcation. The cell pellets were
resuspended in lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) and
disrupted by ultrasonication (Scientz, China). The lysates were then
centrifuged at 17418 ×g for 30 minutes at 4 °C, and the supernatants
were loaded onto Ni-NTA columns (Smart Lifesciences, China, Ni NTA
Beads 6FF: SA005500) pre-equilibrated with lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-
HCl, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Following sample loading and subsequent
washing steps, bound proteins were eluted using an elution buffer
(25 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole, pH 7.4). The pro-
tein was concentrated and buffer-exchanged using Amicon Ultra cen-
trifugal ﬁlters (Millipore, 10 kDa MWCO) through repeated cycles of
dilution with lysis buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.4) and
centrifugation at 3345 ×g for 25 min intervals at 4 °C for ultraﬁltration.
Finally, the fractions containing the puriﬁed protein wereﬂash-frozen
at − 20 °C in storage buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl, 10%
glycerol).
Differential Scanning Fluorimetry (DSF)
The Tm values were determined using the Differential Scanning
Fluorimetry (DSF) method with the Protein Thermal Shift Dye Kit
(Thermo Fisher, U.S.A). To prepare the reaction mixture, 1.0μLo f
SYPRO Orange Dye (SUPELCO, U.S.A) was diluted in 49μLo fl y s i s
buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, pH 7.4). Next, 1μLo ft h e
diluted dye was combined with 19μL of protein solution at a con-
centration of 0.1 mg/mL. DSF experiments were conducted using
the LightCycler 480 Instrument II (ROChe, U.S.A). The reaction
mixture was ﬁrst equilibrated at 25 °C, then gradually heated to
99 °C at a rate of 0.05 °C/s, with a 2 min hold at theﬁnal tempera-
ture. Data processing was performed using the Protein Thermal
Shift software.
Nano differential scanning calorimetry (nanoDSC)
Nano DSC measurements were performed by using Nano DSC instru-
ments (TA, U.S.A.). The concentration of PETases was 0.5 mg/ml in a
buffer containing 25 mM Tris–HCl (pH = 7.5) and 500 mM NaCl. All the
experiments were carried out at temperatures ranging from 10 to
110
◦C with a heating rate of 1◦C/min and under a pressure of 3 atm. The
melting curves of PETases were subtracted from the buffer scans.
Enzymatic activity screening usingp-Nitrophenyl Butyrate
(pNPB) as substrate
Screening for activity on 4-Nitrophenol butyrate (pNPB). All reac-
tions were conducted in 96-well plates with a total reaction volume
of 100μL. The ﬁnal concentration of pNPB was 0.8 mM, and the
enzyme concentration was 100 µg/mL. Each reaction mixture
contained 10 μLo f pNPB solution (dissolved in anhydrous etha-
nol), 80 μL of 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0), and
10 μL of enzyme solution, which were incubated at 37 °C for
10 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 100μL of anhy-
drous ethanol to quench the enzymatic activity. Each experiment
was performed in triplicate. The concentration of p-nitrophenol
was measured at 410 nm using an MD SpectraMax iD5 microplate
reader (Molecular Devices, U.S.A.). The speciﬁc activity was cal-
culated by determining the product quantity using a standard
curve and then combining it with the enzyme concentration and
reaction time. (Supplementary Fig. 4). All experiments were con-
ducted in triplicate to ensure reproducibility.
For Kinetics analysis, enzymatic reactions involving 4-nitrophenyl
butyrate (pNPB) were conducted in 96-well plates with a total reaction
volume of 100μL. Theﬁnal pNPB concentrations ranged from 0.2 to
1.8 mM, while the enzyme concentration was maintained at 0.5µg/mL.
Each reaction mixture contained 10μLo fpNPB solution (dissolved in
anhydrous ethanol), 80μL of 10 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH
8.0), and 10μL of enzyme preparation, which was incubated at 50 °C
for 3 min. The methods for reaction termination and detection were
identical to those described in the preceding enzymatic activity
screening section. One unit of enzyme activity was deﬁned as the
amount of enzyme required to convert 1μmol ofpNPB per minute.
Kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear regression analysis
of the Michaelis-Menten equation using GraphPad Prism software
(version 8.0), with initial velocity data obtained from triplicate mea-
surements at varying substrate concentrations.
PET depolymerization assay using amorphous PETﬁlm as
substrate
In the PET degradation activity assays of 26 candidate proteins and the
comparative analysis ofKbPETase with other wild-type enzymes, the
following conditions were employed: amorphous PETﬁlm (Good-
fellow, England) was cut into circular discs with a diameter of 6 mm for
each reaction. The discs were incubated in 2900µL of glycine-NaOH
buffer (pH 9.0, 50 mM) containing 100µL of enzyme solution (stock
concentration 0.5 mg/mL) at 30, 40, 50, 55, 60 and 65 °C for 72 h. The
reaction was terminated by heating the mixture at 90 °C for 10 min.
Each sample was diluted to fall within the linear detection range for
terephthalic acid (TPA) and mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate
(MHET). Afterﬁltration through a 0.22µm ﬁlter, the assay solution was
analyzed by UPLC. All experiments were performed in triplicate. For
the comparison of activity with LCC, LCC
ICCG, and FastPETase, the
reaction buffers for all three enzymes were replaced with 100 mM
potassium phosphate buffer, pH 8.0, while other conditions remained
consistent with those described above.
UPLC analysis
UPLC analysis was conducted using a Waters ACQUITY Arc system
(Waters, U.S.A.) equipped with an autosampler and a UV detector
set to 260 nm. The separation was performed on a Kinetex XB-C18
100 Å, 5µm, 50 × 2.1 mm LC column (Phenomenex, U.S.A.) using a
stepped, isocratic solvent gradient. Mobile phase A consisted of
water with 0.1% formic acid, and mobile phase B was acetonitrile,
with aﬁxed ﬂow rate of 1.0 mL/min. Samples were injected at either
1 µL. Following injection, the mobile phase was maintained at 13%
buffer B for 52 s to separate mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate
(MHET) and terephthalic acid (TPA), then ramped up to 95% buffer B

for 33 seconds to separate larger reaction products and con-
taminants. The buffer was then returned to 13% for column re-
equilibration, with a total run time of 1.8 min. Peaks were identiﬁed
by comparison to chemical standards prepared from commercial
TPA and in-house synthesized MHET, and the peak areas were
integrated using software. Under these conditions, TPA eluted
around 1.0 min, MHET around 2.3 min, and small amounts of bis(2-
hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) and longer oligomers eluted
between 2.7 and 3.2 min. The concentrations of TPA and MHET were
determined by constructing standard curves.
Crystallization and structure determination ofKbPETase
Crystals ofKbPETase, grown using hanging drop vapor diffusion by
mixing equal volumes of protein and a buffer solution containing
1.26 M Sodium phosphate monobasic monohydrate,0.14 M Potassium
phosphate dibasic at a temperature 291 K. Crystals were rapidly soaked
in the reservoir solution supplemented with 20% glycerol as cryo-
protectant, mounted on loops, andﬂash-cooled at 100 K in a nitrogen
gas cryo-stream. Crystals Diffraction data was collected from a single
crystal at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility (SSRF) BL18U
beamline, China, with a wavelength of 1.75 Å at 100 K. The diffraction
data were processed and scaled with HKL-3000. Relevant statistics
were summarized in Supplementary Table 1.
The structure was solved by the molecular replacement method
with a starting model predicted by AlphaFold II. The Initial model was
build using PHENIX.autobuild. Manual adjustment of the model was
carried out using the program COOT, and the models were reﬁned by
PHENIX.reﬁnement and Refmac5. Stereochemical quality of the
structures was checked by using PROCHECK. All of the residues
locate in the favored and allowed region and none in the disallowed
region. Reﬁnement resulted in a model with excellent reﬁnement
statistics and geometry (Supplementary Table 1). The structure of
KbPETase was deposited in the Protein Data Bank, with PDB
code 9IW9.
Molecular dynamics simulations
The structures of proteins were obtained from the PDB database.
For KbPETase, we utilized the crystal structure resolved in this
study, while PDB(8CMV) was used for the simulation of LCC and
PDB (6EQG) for IsPETase. All of the three PDB are apo structure,
without substrate. Protein and a large number of water molecules
were ﬁlled in a cubic box. Chlorine counter ions were added to keep
the system neutral in charge. The CHARMM27 forceﬁeld was used
for the complex and the CHARMM-modiﬁed TIP3P model was cho-
sen for water
63– 65. The simulations were carried out at 310 K. After
the 4000-step energy minimization procedure, the systems were
heated and equilibrated for 100 ps in the NVT ensemble and 500 ps
in the NPT ensemble. For each protein, 500 ns production simula-
tions were conducted with a trajectory saving frequency of 10 ps.
The ﬁnal 300 ns (30,000 frames) were extracted for subsequent
analysis. The integration step was set to 2 fs, and only the covalent
bonds with hydrogen atoms were constrained by the LINCS algo-
rithm. Lennard-Jones interactions were truncated at 12 Å with a
force-switching function from 10 to 12 Å. The electrostatic interac-
tions were calculated using the particle mesh Ewald method with a
cutoff of 12 Å on an approximately 1 Å grid with a fourth-order
spline. The temperature and pressure of the system were controlled
by the velocity rescaling thermostat and the Parrinello-Rahman
algorithm, respectively. All MD simulations were performed using
the GROMACS 2025.1 software package.
Lifetime of hydrogen bonds
To systematically evaluate the stability of hydrogen bonds within the
catalytic sites of the three proteins, we computed the lifetime (τ)o f
each identiﬁed hydrogen bond using the following methodology:
First, the autocorrelation function of each hydrogen bond was
calculated by:
C
x tðÞ =
hi, jðt0Þ/C1 hi, jðt0 + tÞ
DE
hi, j ðt0Þ2
DE
Here, hi,j(t0) is a binary indicator (0 or 1) for hydrogen bond for-
mation between donori and acceptorj at timet0, and the angle brackets
denote time averaging over all trajectory frames. Subsequently, the
lifetime (τ) of each hydrogen bond was derived by integrating the
autocorrelation function over the total simulation timeT:
τx =
Z T
0
Cx ðtÞdt
Here,dt represents the trajectory sampling interval (10 ps). Larger
τ values correspond to more stable hydrogen bonds, reﬂecting their
persistence across the simulation.
