The extreme durability of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) debris has rendered it a long-term
environmental burden. At the same time, current recycling efforts still lack sustainability. Two
recently discovered bacterial enzymes that speciﬁcally degrade PET represent a promising
solution. First, Ideonella sakaiensis PETase, a structurally well-characterized consensus
α/β-hydrolase fold enzyme, converts PET to mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET).
MHETase, the second key enzyme, hydrolyzes MHET to the PET educts terephthalate and
ethylene glycol. Here, we report the crystal structures of active ligand-free MHETase and
MHETase bound to a nonhydrolyzable MHET analog. MHETase, which is reminiscent of
feruloyl esterases, possesses a classicα/β-hydrolase domain and a lid domain conferring
substrate speciﬁcity. In the light of structure-based mapping of the active site, activity assays,
mutagenesis studies and aﬁrst structure-guided alteration of substrate speciﬁcity towards
bis-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) reported here, we anticipate MHETase to be a
valuable resource to further advance enzymatic plastic degradation.

ppreciating its simple synthesis, robustness and durability,
industrial production of PET was launched soon after its
discovery and has been gradually increasing, projected to
be over 70 million tons in 20201,2. One of the biggest advantages
of PET is its chemical inertness due to the hydrophobicity of
the terephthalic acid (TPA) moiety, rendering it nearly resistant
to environmental degradation. Although PET and other synthetic
polymer plastics are considered nontoxic, larger particles and
micro granules thereof are durable, omnipresent in marine or
terrestrial habitats and accumulate in living organisms3–5. Often,
they are also the carriers of potentially toxic colorants and
additives5–7. Current recycling efforts cover only a fraction of
PET waste and yield downgraded lower value products. They
depend on the addition of large quantities of virgin polymer
and signiﬁcant consumption of energy4. Alternatively, several
enzymes have been identiﬁed that can hydrolyze PET to TPA
and ethylene glycol at elevated temperatures, albeit with low
activity8–11. Enzyme optimization by biotechnology has been
successful to some degree12–17, but has so far not led to enzymes,
which can fully penetrate and degrade a thick layer of highly
crystalline PET in a cost-effective and environmentally friendly
manner.
Recently, the bacterial strain Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6 was
discovered and shown to grow on low-crystallinity PET ﬁlms.
Two α/β-hydrolase fold enzymes (α/β-hydrolases), PETase and
MHETase, work together to degrade PET in two steps via MHET,
yielding TPA and ethylene glycol— the building blocks required
for a new round of PET synthesis (Fig.1a)
10,18. Recent crystal
structures of PETase bound to ligands conﬁrmed the predictedα/
β-hydrolase fold, elucidated substrate binding, mode of catalysis
and even permitted the enhancement of catalytic properties or
alteration of substrate speciﬁcity16,17,19–21. Compared to known

PET-degrading esterases, PETase fromI. sakaiensisshows higher
activity at ambient temperature and on highly crystalline PET10.
In contrast, the structure ofI. sakaiensis MHETase, the second
enzyme— and crucial for full PET degradation— is still unknown.
MHETase was initially assigned to the tannase enzyme family,
which belongs to Block X of the α/β-hydrolase fold enzymes
classiﬁed in the ESTHER database 10,22. This family includes
fungal and bacterial tannases and feruloyl esterases. Other
signiﬁcantly different bacterial tannases can be found in a
distinct Block H (Tannases_bact) in this database. Consistently,
MHETase was shown to exclusively hydrolyze MHET but not
BHET, PET, p-nitrophenyl (pNP) aliphatic esters or aromatic
ester compounds such as ethyl gallate and ethyl ferulate which are
converted by other enzymes from the tannase family, indicating a
highly restricted substrate speci ﬁcity10. All plastic-degrading
enzymes known so far display anα/β-hydrolase fold. MHETase,
however, is likely to possess a scaffold unprecedented for plastic-
degrading enzymes. This may be exploited in order to improve
catalysis and to expand substrate speciﬁcity and thus signiﬁcantly
advance enzymatic plastic polymer degradation.
Here, we present the crystal structures ofI. sakaiensisPETase,
MHETase and MHETase bound to a nonhydrolyzable substrate
analog (MHETA) or to benzoic acid. A structure-based mapping
of the active site by mutations and binding studies with different
substrates was used to determine the molecular basis for product
inhibition and guided the development of MHETase variants with
enhanced activity towards MHET or even an altered substrate
speciﬁcity towards BHET. We anticipate our data to signiﬁcantly
advance the current understanding of enzymes degrading syn-
thetic polyesters.
Results
Structure and phylogeny of I. sakaiensis MHETase. We have
determined crystal structures of recombinantly expressed and
puriﬁed I. sakaiensis MHETase in its ligand-free form (2.05 Å
resolution), MHETase bound to a nonhydrolyzable mono-(2-
hydroxyethyl) terephthalamide (MHETA, 2.1 Å resolution) or to
benzoic acid (BA, 2.2 Å resolution) as well as ligand-free PETase
(2.0 Å resolution) (Supplementary Figs. 1, 2a−f, Supplementary
Table 1). The structure of PETase was solved by molecular
replacement (MR) employing the structural coordinates of T.
fusca cutinase TfCut2 (PDB entry 4CG111,23; see Methods). The
structure of MHETase was solved by an MR pipeline employing a
recent feruloyl esterase structure (PDB entry 6G21; see Methods).
The overall domain architecture of the 65 kDa MHETase
resembles that of feruloyl esterases, with a lid domain inserted
between β-strand 7 and α-helix 15 of the α/β-hydrolase fold
(Fig. 1b, Supplementary Fig. 1).
As previously observed for feruloyl esterases, the presence of a
structural calcium-binding site was conﬁrmed by X-rayﬂuores-
cence spectroscopy for MHETase (Fig.1b, Supplementary Fig. 2b).
Likewise, one ofﬁve disulﬁde bonds isﬂanking a catalytic triad
(formed by S225, H528, D492) and the oxyanion hole comprising
the backbone amide nitrogen atoms of G132 and E226 (Fig.1c)24.
In the ligand-free structure of MHETase, several water molecules
are maintained by a hydrogen bond network at the substrate-
binding site (Fig. 1c). While the α/β-hydrolase domain super-
imposes well with the closest structurally characterized feruloyl
esterase homolog FaeB fromA. oryzae(1.60 Å RMSD for 280 out
of 342 residues aligned, 32.5% amino acid identity), the lid
domain of MHETase contains several additional loops that
markedly differ from FaeB (2.33 Å RMSD for 148 out of 215
residues aligned, 18.9% identity) (Fig. 1b, d)24. The overall
structures of MHETase and FaeB are structurally similar (2.04 Å
RMSD for 421 out of 559 residues aligned) despite a relatively low
number of amino acid identities (27.5%). When comparing
MHETase with known tannase structures, e.g tannin acylα/β-
hydrolase from Lactobacillus plantarum (LptE), it is evident
that only the overall fold of theα/β-hydrolase domain is similar
(2.77 Å RMSD for 195 out of 282 residues aligned, 13.8%
identity), while very large differences (5.24 Å RMSD) are
observed for the lid domain (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b)25. PETase
and MHETase only share theα/β-hydrolase fold (2.87 Å RMSD
for 184 out of 262 residues aligned; Supplementary Fig. 3c).
A phylogenetic analysis groups MHETase with the feruloyl
esterases and tannases of Block X in the ESTHER database. It is
located in a branch with no other structures (Supplementary
Fig. 4). The structures of the closest MHETase relatives are
3WMT and 6G21, two feruloyl esterases ofAspergillus oryzae.
With them, MHETase shares not only the catalytic triad S225-
H528-D492 (3WMT: S203-H457-D417, 6G21: S169-H421-D381)
but also G132 (G125, G91) as part of the oxyanion hole and
C224-C529 (C202-C528, C168-C422), whose disul ﬁde bond
holds the catalytic residues Ser and His together24. All these
residues are in the catalytic domain, the disulﬁde bond is typical
(>80% conservation) for the tannase family in Block X ofα/β-
hydrolases according to the ESTHER database (Fig.1b–e)22,24.
The lid domain of the feruloyl esterases displays the same α-
helical fold, but the amino acid sequences cannot be aligned
without structural information. A binding pocket— like that for
MHET in MHETase— also exists in feruloyl esterases, but not a
single one of the lining residues is conserved. However, a
comparison of the MHETase active site to that of FaeB reveals
several residues around the catalytic triad that may contribute
to substrate positioning in a similar fashion (e.g. L235, F354
and L245, F415 in FaeB and MHETase, respectively) (Fig.1c, e).
Most likely, it is the alteration in the substrates, especially
the carboxylic acid group of MHET vs. the phenolic (methyl
ether) groups and the elongating double bond of ferulates that
has evoked this difference. The substrates of tannases, e.g.
gallates, are more similar at least with respect to their size to
MHET. The only tannase structure available in complex with
ethyl gallate is from Lactobacillus plantarum (4J0K), which
belongs to the bacterial tannase family in Block H of α/β-
hydrolases according to the ESTHER database
22,25. The tannase
catalytic domains are suf ﬁciently conserved, such that the
catalytic triad superimposes well. However, the sequences differ
strongly, the disulﬁde bond is missing and the lid domain has a
markedly different fold.
Structure of MHETase bound to a nonhydrolyzable ligand. The
main chain conformation in the MHETase-MHETA complex
structure is nearly identical to that of MHETase without substrate
(RMSD 0.54 Å) and sheds light on the positioning of MHET for
catalysis. While the catalytic triad and oxyanion hole residues
are part of the α/β-hydrolase domain, substrate speciﬁcity is
almost exclusively conferred by the lid domain (Fig. 2a, b).
Hydrophobic contacts between the phenyl ring of MHETA and
the α/β-hydrolase domain are restricted to primarily F495, and
to a lesser extent G132 and A494. Strikingly, MHETA is
tightly bound by the lid domain residues F415, L254 and
W397 surrounding nearly the entire MHETA phenyl moiety. The
two oxygens of the free carboxylate make contacts to R411, which
is held in place by S416, S419 and the backbone amide of G258,
which maintain a hydrogen bond network involving three water
molecules.
Despite their overall high similarity, a detailed comparison of
MHETase structures in the absence and presence of the substrate
reveals an induced- ﬁt mechanism upon MHETA binding
(Fig. 2c, d). In the ligand-free structure, F415 points away from

the active site and thus opens it for substrate binding. The
association of MHETA then triggers a near 180° rotation of the
F415 side chain around χ1, closing the active site and
consolidating the interaction.
Lastly, unlike PETase, MHETase binds to its substrate very
tightly with a Km of 7.3 µM17. A comparison of the active-site
molecular surfaces of LptE, PETase and MHETase in their
substrate-bound states illustrates a higher solvent accessibility of
LptE and PETase, which is partially related to the induced-ﬁt
mechanism observed for MHETase and the number of residues
contacting the respective substrate (Fig. 2c, d, Supplementary
Figure 5 a–d).
The positioning of the substrate in the active site of MHETase
is reminiscent of the tannin acylα/β-hydrolase fromL. plantarum
bound to ethyl gallate (LptE) but displays marked differences with
respect to the residues contacting the substrate at the interface
(Fig. 2b, e). In the LptE structure, the phenyl moiety of ethyl
gallate is exclusively contacted by I206 and G77 of the α/β-
hydrolase domain while the three hydroxyl groups are hydrogen-
bonded to D421 of theα/β-hydrolase domain and to K343 and
E357 of the lid domain. Thus, the contribution of the LptE lid
domain to substrate binding is much reduced, compared to the
situation in MHETase.
MHETase ligand spectrum and implications for the active site.
The substrate-binding position of PETase fundamentally differs
from that of MHETase as shown for the PETase-1-(2-hydro-
xyethyl) 4-methyl terephthalate (HEMT) and p-nitrophenol
(pNP) co-structures (Supplementary Figure 5 a–c). In particular
for PETase, the absence of a lid domain limits the number of
residues involved in immediate substrate recognition down
to four.
Primarily the phenyl moiety of HEMT and also pNP is bound
by hydrophobic contacts of Y85, M132, W156 and I179, but the
methyl ester or hydroxyl group in the 4-position of HEMT or
pNP, respectively, is fully exposed to the bulk solvent (Supple-
mentary Figure 5 a–c). In summary, the complexity of substrate
recognition by MHETase clearly distinguishes it from other
enzymes, such as tannases or even PETase.
Apart from the entire substrate, even substrate sub-structures
and analogs such as benzoic acid or nicotinic acid are able
to bind tightly to MHETase as observed in the respective co-
structure and in differential scanningﬂuorimetry (DSF) measure-
ments (Supplementary Figure 6a, Fig. 3). It is again mainly
lid domain residues, which establish the contacts to benzoic acid
and place it in an identical position as MHETA (Supplementary
Figure 6b).
A comparison of potential MHETase ligands with limited
variations by DSF con ﬁrms which functional groups are
recognized by the MHETase binding site (for ligand quality
control, see Supplementary Figure 7a–f). Our structural analysis
suggests that R411 enforces a strictly required negative charge in
the 4-position to the hydrolyzed ester bond, which clearly

explains why diesters and diamides show no binding to
MHETase. BHET binding is thus excluded and MHET will
only bind in the proper orientation but not with the
hydroxyethyl group buried in the substrate pocket (Fig. 2b).
Nitro groups can bind weakly when partially charged as a
resonance structure with a phenolate or thiophenolate group.
Negatively charged tetrahedral groups (sp3) as in sulfonic and
arsenic acids can bind to MHETase but are clearly outperformed
by the planar (sp2) group of the carboxylate (Fig. 3). Conse-
quently, the loss of the positive charge in the MHETase R411Q
and R411A variants leads to strongly reduced substrate binding
and decreased inhibition by benzoate in mono-4-nitrophenyl
terephthalate (MpNPT) hydrolysis (Supplementary Figure 8,
Supplementary Table 2).
Effect of MHETase mutants and generation of BHETase
activity. The central role of R411 in coordinating the carboxylic
acid function of the substrate was additionally con ﬁrmed by
activity assays with the variants R411A and R411Q. These
mutants show a strong increase of Km and some decrease in
turnover rate against MpNPT (Fig. 4a). Furthermore, R411A
and R411Q mutations almost completely abolish the conversion
of the natural substrate MHET (Fig.4b). If the hydrogen bon-
d of the substrate carboxylate to S416 or S419 is also abolished
in double mutants, Km further increases to about 1000-fold
over the wild-type level (Fig. 4a). Thus, substrate recognition
strongly relies on the aromatic ring as well as the carboxylate
function of MHET both guiding its positioning for hydrolysis.
Inhibitor experiments with benzoate derivatives and R411 and
S416 mutants also demonstrate the importance of the interaction
between the carboxylate moiety of the ligand and R411 together
with hydrogen bonding for tight binding (Supplementary
Table 2).
The high afﬁnity for compounds with a benzoate substructure
is expected to lead to product inhibition by formed TPA when

Fig. 3 Differential scanning ﬂuorimetry of MHETase with various ligands. Stabilization of MHETase wild type as measured by an increase in the
melting temperature (Tm) compared to the ligand-free protein (Tm, ligand-free) is clearly dependent on the functional group, which binds to the rear of the
substrate-binding site. Neutral functional groups (gray) affectTm weakest, partially negative groups (yellow) weakly, negatively charged groups more
strongly, depending on their geometry: tetrahedrally coordinated medium (orange) and trigonal planar most strongly (red). Ligands diluted to 10 mM

higher concentrations of MHET are hydrolyzed in vitro. This is
demonstrated by the decreasing reaction rate for MHET
hydrolysis over time (Supplementary Figure 9a). The effect of
product inhibition is likely less pronounced in the natural
environment where formed TPA is metabolized by the bacterium.
As MHETase was previously not biochemically characterized in
detail, temperature and pH proﬁles were also recorded (Supple-
mentary Figure 9b-c). With high activities from pH 6.0 to 9.5,
the enzyme is applicable over a broad pH range. The activity
increases with rising temperature up to 44 °C after which the
enzyme is rapidly inactivated.
While residues of the catalytic triad were veriﬁed by activity
assays with the respective alanine mutants, an unaltered high
turnover of H488A rules out the presence of a catalytic tetrad in
MHETase (Figs. 2b, 4a, b) 24. The importance of F495 for
substrate binding is underlined by signi ﬁcant decreases in
turnover rates of the natural substrate MHET and the
chromogenic substrate MpNPT by the respective alanine mutant
(Fig. 4a, b). The activity at high substrate concentrations is
increased with the W397A variant at the expense of a lower
substrate afﬁnity (Fig. 4a, b).
While this mutation could be a disadvantage for the bacterium
in the natural environment where low substrate concentrations
are expected, it is advantageous for biotechnological applications
running at substrate concentrations about 105-fold higher than
Km— which is in the 100 mM range.
The structural reasons for a high MHETase activity towards
MHET (kcat 11.1 ± 1.4 s−1) and a very low activity towards BHET
(kcat 0.0011 ± 0.0002 s−1) have not been explained before (Fig.4b,
c)10. In the light of our structural data, we anticipated that
modiﬁcations in the distal part of the binding pocket that
mediates electrostatic interactions with the MHET carboxylate
may confer activity towards BHET. Strikingly, the S416A and
S419G mutants retain MHETase activity and permit the
conversion of BHET to TPA which may be explained by the
increased ﬂexibility of R411 in these mutants allowing BHET
binding (Fig. 4c). Also, providing more space in the inner active
site and introduction of potential hydrogen bonding partners
conferred by the variants F424Q and F424N signi ﬁcantly
increases the turnover of BHET by MHETase (Figs. 2b, 4c).
The removal of positive charge in the variants R411A and R411Q
also allows a signiﬁcantly higher turnover of BHET. When these

mutations are further combined with mutations at S416 and S419,
the turnover of BHET can be increased 120-fold compared to
wild type (Fig.4c).
Lastly, wild-type MHETase and variants S416A F424N and
R411A S419G F424N, which have BHETase activity, were also
examined for activity towards coumaric acid methyl ester, caffeic
acid methyl ester, chlorogenic acid andp-hydroxy benzoic acid
methyl ester, substrates for feruloyl and chlorogenate esterases.
No activity above background (no enzyme) could be detected.
Discussion
The microbial degradation and metabolization of PET— and its
degradation intermediate MHET— as a carbon and energy source
has only come up recently in the environment. To understand the
evolutionary origin of MHETase is therefore highly relevant for
enzymatic plastic degradation in general10,18. Phylogenetic ana-
lysis groups MHETase in the tannase family of theα/β-hydrolase
fold enzymes (Supplementary Figure 4). Its closest relatives act on
the larger substrate ferulate whereas the more similar gallate is the
substrate of more distantly related tannases. Whether MHETase
derived from a feruloyl esterase or tannase ancestor cannot be
answered yet. Typical tannase substrates like hydroxy cinnamo-
ates and hydroxy benzoates are neither converted by MHETase
(as shown already10) nor by the MHETase variants with BHETase
activity which we engineered and presented here.
Our structural results on MHETase identiﬁed the lid domain
as the major difference to the closely related tannase and
feruloyl esterases (Fig.1b–e). Interestingly, it was already pointed
out that major switches in enzyme function might occur during
natural evolution through loop insertion, deletion or recombi-
nation26. To this end, our results indicate that MHETase
might originate indeed from a loop modi ﬁcation in the lid
domain leading to the reported activity towards MHET hydro-
lysis although no homologous tannase or feruloyl esterase
sequence could be identiﬁed in theI. sakaiensisgenome. Notably,
these loops confer a crucial speci ﬁcity for the para-carboxy
group of the substrate (Fig.3). This specialization for the natural
substrate MHET also explains the very low activity of
MHETase towards the intermediate BHET in the wild-type
enzyme. In the natural environment, missing activity towards
BHET is not critical as the upstream enzyme, PETase, already
hydrolyzes BHET to MHET10.
The structure of MHETase represents a key step in under-
standing the process of microbial PET degradation in
I. sakaiensis. Our structural and mutational analyses shed light
on the substrate recognition using an induced- ﬁt mechanism
and enabled ﬁrst structure-guided alterations of substrate speci-
ﬁcity of MHETase. We were thus successful in generating
an MHETase variant, which hydrolyzes the PETase products
MHET and BHET down to the very building blocks, which are
required for a sustainable re-synthesis of the polyethylene
terephthalate polymer. Contrasting consensus α/β-hydrolases,
the bipartite architecture of MHETase parts catalysis from sub-
strate recognition — a scenario where we envision the lid
domain as a tunable platform to enhance catalytic properties (e.g.
alleviating substrate release) or alter substrate speci ﬁcity
(as shown initially for the S416A, R411Q or F424N mutants
reported here).
With the structures of MHETase available, our detailed insights
into its mechanism and in particular the generation of a BHETase
with altered substrate speci ﬁcity, it will now be possible to
rationally create even more efﬁcient MHETase variants cleaving
other partial degradation products from related polymers. Repla-
cing TPA in PET by thiophen-, furan- or pyridine-dicarboxylic
acid has long been described27. Exchanging the carboxylic esters
by sulfonic esters in polymers is also possible28. Polyesters of 2,5-
furandicarboxylate with ethylene glycol (PEF) or other alcohols
are suitable to replace PET in bottles29. This new plastic PEF can
be degraded by PETase 19. The product hydroxyethyl-2,5-fur-
andicarboxylate is similar enough to MHET to envision structure-
guided mutagenesis of MHETase to evolve a“MHEFase” for the
full cycle from renewable carbohydrates to PEF and back to
polymer building blocks by green chemistry.
The potential use of MHETase in recycling of these alternative
polyesters underlines the need to understand and customize
binding to different substrates. We thus anticipate that our
extensive structural characterization and initial rational modula-
tion of MHETase substrate speci ﬁcity provides an excellent
starting point for the development of tailor-made, enzymatic PET
degradation systems based on a MHETase scaffold and in com-
bination with PETase.
Methods
Reagents. PET was obtained from commercial bottles. All other chemicals were
purchased at the highest purity from Sigma-Aldrich, Carl Roth, Alfa Aesar or
Acros if not stated otherwise.
Synthesis of ligands and substrates. Identity and purity of all synthesized
compounds was veriﬁed by NMR.1H spectra were measured in DMSO-d6 on a
Bruker Avance II 300 equipped with a 5 mm PABBO BB-1H/D Z-GRD Z104275/
0398 probehead at 25–28 °C (Fig. S7a-f). For the calibration of the measurements
tetramethylsilane was used.
Bishydroxyethyl terephthalate (BHET): BHET was synthesized from a PET
bottle by alcoholysis with ethylene glycol. Twenty grams PET and 0.2 g
anhydrous sodium acetate were reﬂuxed in 120 mL ethylene glycol for 8 h and
afterwards cooled overnight. 120 mL H
2O was added andﬁltration was
performed at 4 °C. The product was washed with 20 mL cold H2O and extracted
several times with hot H2O. BHET appeared as white needles (18 g (68%),
Mp 210–212 °C).
Bishydroxyethyl terephthalic acid amide(BHETA): BHETA was synthesized
from PET by aminolysis with 2-amino ethanol. Twenty grams PET and 0.2 g
anhydrous sodium acetate were reﬂuxed in 120 mL ethanolamine for 8 h and
afterwards cooled overnight. 120 mL H
2O was added andﬁltration was performed
at 4 °C. The product was washed with 20 mL cold H2O and recrystallized twice
with 100 mL hot H2O. BHETA appeared as lightly rose needles (20 g (76%),
Mp 240–243 °C).
Dimethyl terephthalate (DMT): DMT was synthesized by esteriﬁcation of
terephthaloyl chloride with methanol. 25 mmol terephthaloyl chloride was reacted
with 30 mL methanol at RT and then reﬂuxed for 3 h. After distilling the methanol
and drying at 60 °C, 4.08 g was obtained (Mp 144–148 °C). Washing with 0.5 M
KOH and water did not change the melting point.
Monohydroxyethyl terephthalate (MHET): MHET was synthesized from BHET
by partial hydrolysis with KOH. 8.7 mmol BHET was reacted with 8.4 mmol KOH
in 18 mL MgSO4-dried ethylene glycol at 110–130 °C for 2.5 h. Thirty milliliters
H2O was added and the mixture was extracted three times with 5 mL CHCl3. The
aqueous phase was adjusted to pH 3 with 25% HCl andﬁltered at 4 °C. After two
extraction steps with 30 mL hot H2O andﬁltration at 4 °C, the precipitate was dried
at 60 °C (0.56 g (30%), Mp 185–190 °C).
Monohydroxyethyl terephthalic acid amide(MHETA): MHETA was
synthesized by partial amidation of terephthaloyl chloride with ethanolamine.
150 mmol NaOH and 50 mmol ethanolamine in 50 mL H
2O were added dropwise
within 1 h to 50 mmol terephthaloyl chloride in 50 mL H2O at 0 °C. The reaction
was performed for another 2 h at 0 °C and 2 h under reﬂux, followed by hot
ﬁltration. The pH was adjusted to 3 with 25% HCl. The obtained suspension was
ﬁltered cold and theﬁltrate was washed with 20 mL cold water. The product
was recrystallized from 100 mL hot H2O to yield shiny crystals (2.4 g (23%), Mp
209–212 °C).
Mono-4-nitrophenyl terephthalate (MpNPT): MpNPT was synthesized by
esteriﬁcation of terephthaloyl chloride with 4-nitrophenolate. 50 mmol
terephthaloyl chloride and 50 mmol sodium 4-nitrophenolate were suspended in
50 mL diethylether and reacted for 2 h at 0 °C, then at RT overnight. 2.5 g Na2CO3
and 4.5 g NaHCO3 in 50 mL H2O were added and reacted at RT for 10 h. The pH
was adjusted to 8.5 with NaOH. The insoluble fraction was further extracted with a
total of 2.5 g Na2CO3 and 2.5 g NaHCO3 in 100 mL H2O and then washed until a
neutral pH. MpNPT was precipitated with HCl at pH 3 and washed twice with
50 mL 0.1 M HCl and then until a neutral pH. MpNPT was separated from
contaminating bis-4-nitrophenyl terephthalate by extraction with 100 mM NaPi
pH 7.4 and acid precipitation. The very faint yellow slurry was dried at 60 °C
(Mp 202 °C).
Puriﬁcation as well as crystallization and structure solution. I. sakaiensis

USA) as a codon-optimized synthetic gene containing a C-terminal His6-tag
subcloned into pET-21b. A codon-optimized DNA fragment encodingI. sakaiensis
MHETase (amino acid residues 20–603) cloned in a pUC19 vector was ordered
from Genscript and later subcloned into a pColdII expression plasmid with a
N-terminal His6-tag (TAKARA BIO, Inc., Otsu, Shiga, Japan) by FastCloning
(Supplementary Figure 11)30.
For protein expression,E. coli Shufﬂe T7 express cells (New England Biolabs,
Frankfurt, Germany) were transformed with the plasmids and selected on lysogeny
broth (LB) agar plates containing 100 µgmL
−1 ampicillin. After growth overnight
at 30 °C, overnight cultures were inoculated. For overexpression, 1 L bafﬂed
Erlenmeyer ﬂasks containing 200 mL LB medium supplemented with 100 µg mL−1
ampicillin were used. The cells were grown at 33 °C and 160 rpm shaking velocity
to an optical density at 600 nm (OD600) of 1 before 1 mM isopropylβ-D-1-
thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) was added. At an OD600 of 2.5, the temperature was
lowered to 16 °C and the overexpression continued overnight. The cells were
harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C, 10,000 ×g for 20 min and stored at–20 °C until
further use.
Cells were disrupted by sonication in 50 mM TRIS-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl,
10 mM imidazole and 1 mM Dithiothreitol (DTT) (buffer R). Cell debris was
cleared by centrifugation. The cell extract was loaded on a gravityﬂow column with
Ni-NTA sepharose, washed with buffer R supplemented with 20 mM imidazole
and eluted with buffer R supplemented with 200 mM imidazole (300 mM imidazole
in the case of PETase). Protein fractions were puriﬁed on a Superdex75 10/300
column (GE Healthcare, Solingen, Germany) with 20 mM TRIS pH 7.5, 150 mM
NaCl, concentrated to ~10 mg mL
−1, ﬂash-frozen in liquid N2 and stored at–80 °C.
Protein concentrations were determined spectrophotometrically usingε280 = 102
955 M−1 cm−1 (ε280 = 97,455 M−1 cm−1 for mutant W397A). Purity of the
samples was estimated employing the GelAnalyzer software (Version 2010a).
PETase was crystallized at 10 mg mL−1 concentration by sitting drop vapor
diffusion (1 µL protein plus 1 µL reservoir) at 20 °C. Typical PETase crystals grew
at 20 °C with a reservoir solution containing 0.1 M sodium citrate or sodium
acetate pH 5.0, 15% (v/v) PEG8000 and 0.5 M lithium sulfate. MHETase
crystallized at a concentration of 10 mg mL
−1 by sitting drop vapor diffusion (1 µL
protein plus 1 µL reservoir) at 20 °C with a reservoir containing 0.1 M HEPES,
pH 7.5, 30% (v/v) 2,4-MPD and 0.12 M ammonium sulfate (space group P212121)
or 0.1 M MES, pH 6.5, 10% (v/v) PEG8000 and 0.1 M zinc acetate (space group
P1). MHETase crystals grown with MPD were cryo-cooled in their reservoir
solution. The PETase crystal was cryo-protected with 0.1 M sodium acetate, pH 5.0,
10% (v/v) PEG8000, 15% (v/v) PEG400 and 0.5 M lithium sulfate. The P1
MHETase crystal was cryo-protected with 0.1 M TRIS, pH 8.5, 5% (v/v) PEG8000,
20% (v/v) PEG400 and 0.5 M lithium sulfate. For derivatization experiments,
crystals were incubated for 24 h in the respective cryo-protectant solution saturated
with the ligand andﬂash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. MHETase diffraction data were
collected at 100 K at beamlines 14.1 and 14.2 of the BESSY II storage ring, Berlin,
Germany
31. PETase diffraction data were collected at beamline P13, PETRAIII,
Hamburg32. All diffraction data were processed with XDS33,34.
The structure of PETase was solved by molecular replacement employing the
structural coordinates ofT. fusca cutinase TfCut2 (PDB entry 4CG111,23). The
structure of MHETase complexed to MHETA was solved by molecular
replacement employing the MR pipeline MoRDa35, which placed six copies of a
homology model based on PDB entry 6G21 (an unpublishedA. oryzae feruloyl
esterase, AoFaeB-2; 26% identity to MHETase with a query coverage of 87%).
Structures were complemented during several rounds of reﬁnement with PHENIX.
REFINE or Refmac in the case of PETase35,36 intermitted by manual model
building with COOT which was extensive for MHETase37. The structure of
MHETase complexed to BA was solved by molecular replacement employing the
entire asymmetric unit of the MHETA co-structure as a search model and
completed, respectively. The MHETA and BA ligands were placed into the
respective densities unambiguously at theﬁnal stages of reﬁnement. The structure
of the P1 ligand-free MHETase was solved by molecular replacement employing
structure coordinates of aﬁnalized MHETase-MHETA co-structure omitting the
ligand. The ten copies of MHETase in the asymmetric unit were built manually
or by PHENIX.AUTOBUILD and reﬁned with PHENIX.REFINE
36.
Generation of MHETase mutants by site-directed mutagenesis. For the crea-
tion of single-site mutants, either the Q5 site-directed mutagenesis kit (New
England Biolabs) or the QuikChange
® method were used. In theﬁrst case, the kit
was used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. In case of the QuikChange®
method, a standard PCR mixture (25 µL) consisting of 2.5 µL 10× Pfu buffer
(Roboklon GmbH, Berlin, Germany), 0.5 µL mixed deoxynucleoside triphosphates
(0.25 mM each), plasmid DNA (~40 ng), 1.25 µL forward and reverse primers
(10 µM; Supplementary Table 4), 1 µL PfuPlus! polymerase (Roboklon GmbH)
and 18.1 µL ultrapure water was used. For denaturation, the temperature was held
at 95 °C for 30 s. Afterwards 20 cycles of 30 s denaturation at 95 °C, annealing for
30 s at 63 °C and elongation for 6 min at 72 °C were conducted. In a last step the
ﬁnal elongation was accomplished at 72 °C for 10 min. After PCR, the template
DNA was digested withDpnI (New England BioLabs) for 2 h at 37 °C before the
enzyme was inactivated at 80 °C for 10 min.E. coli TOP10 cells were transformed
with the obtained PCR products and plated on LB agar plates containing 100 µg mL
−1 ampicillin and grown overnight at 37 °C. The nucleotide sequence was con-
ﬁrmed by sequencing at Euroﬁns (Ebersberg, Germany).
Autohydrolysis of MpNPT. Hydrolysis was followed spectrophotometrically at
400 nm at 30 °C. At higher pH values, where hydrolysis goes to near completion,
exponential decay wasﬁtted. At lower pH values decay constants were calculated
from initial rates taking into account the purity and the partial deprotonation of
4-nitrophenol (the expected value at pH 7.5 is 12,420 M
−1 cm−1 calculated with
ε405 nm = 18,000 M−1 cm−1 and pKa = 7.15 for 4-nitrophenol)38. Absorption dif-
ference of 4-nitrophenol at 400 and 405 nm was less than 0.5%. Autohydrolysis was
measured from pH 7.5 to 12.5 in 100 mM phosphate or borate buffers and NaOH
solutions with a rate constant ofk
2 = 9.2 M−1 s−1 for d[MpNPT]/dT= k2 [OH−]
[MpNPT], i.e. k1 = 2.9 × 10−6 s−1 (Supplementary Figure 12). In 100 mM TRIS
pH 7.5, also used for enzyme kinetics,k1 = 46 × 10−6 s−1 for d[MpNPT]/dT= k1
[MpNPT] was determined. TRIS thus increases the hydrolysis rate ~10-fold
compared to the expected reaction rate with hydroxide at pH 7.5.
Activity tests. Activity was measured for the substrates MHET and BHET by
HPLC and for MpNPT by spectrophotometry. For the HPLC measurement, the
reactions (100 µL) were stopped by addition of an equal volume of 160 mM NaPi
(sodium phosphate buffer) pH 2.5 with 20% (v/v) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and
heating to 80 °C for 10 min. TPA, MHET and BHET were separated on a Kinetex
5 µm EVO C18 100 Å, 150 × 4.6 mm (Phenomenex, Aschaffenburg, Germany) with
a gradient of acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water at 30 °C after injection
of 10 µL sample. Acetonitrile was increased from 5 to 44% until minute 12 and then
to 70% at minute 15 where the ratio remained constant for 3 min. TPA, MHET and
BHET were detected at 240 nm and quantiﬁcation was realized by the use of
calibration curves.
To quantify the turnover rates of MHET and BHET, reactions (100 µL) with
1 mM of the substrate in 40 mM NaPi pH 7.5 with 80 mM NaCl and 20% (v/v)
DMSO were incubated at 30 °C before they were stopped and analyzed as described
above. MHETase was used at 6 nM for 30 min in case of MHET. For BHET, a
prescreening with 6 nM or 12 nM MHETase variants was used to identify
potentially active enzymes which were afterwards analyzed at higher
concentrations. Around 100 nM of the variants were used for 19.25 h and 3 nM
wild-type MHETase was added to these reactions for the full conversion of the
formed MHET to TPA which was quantiﬁed via HPLC. The experiment was
repeated three times.
MpNPT stock solutions were prepared in DMSO at concentrations of 10, 1 and
0.1 mM. Substrate concentrations were 0.1–1200 µM in 100 mM TRIS pH 7.5 or
100 mM NaPi pH 7.5. Kinetic parameters are the same in both buffers. The
reaction in the 400 µL cuvette was started at 25 °C by addition of the enzyme to a
ﬁnal concentration of ca. 1 nM (active variants) up to 500 nM (inactive variants).
Absorption change was followed on a Cary50 spectrophotometer (Varian) at
400 nm. Absorption changes were corrected for nonenzymatic hydrolysis (see
previous paragraph). Initial rates (on average ten different combinations of enzyme
and substrate concentrations for each variant) were used forﬁtting K
m and vmax
according to the Michaelis Menten kinetics.KI for competitive inhibitors were
measured at 30 °C and are calculated with Eq. (1)

using 4−8 different substrate (i.e. MpNPT) concentrations. Wild type and variants
S225A, 488A, W397A, F495A, F415A, S416A and R411Q were also measured at
30 °C. These kinetic parameters were normalized on wild-type activities at 25 °C.
For measurement of feruloyl and chlorogenate esterase activity four
substrates were tested: coumaric acid methyl ester (Coum-ME), caffeic acid methyl
ester (Caff-ME), chlorogenic acid (Chlorogen) andp-hydroxy-hydroxy benzoic
acid methyl ester (pHB-ME). UV−Vis spectra using 10μM of the ester and the
free acid were measured andΔε calculated (Supplementary Fig. 10). Hydrolysis
was measured as for MpNPT, but with 10–35 nM enzyme, 100 µM substrate
and at 335 nm (Coum-ME,Δε = −6100 M−1 cm−1), 350 nm (Caff-ME,
Δε = −5700 M−1 cm−1), 350 nm (Chlorogen,Δε = −7400 M−1 cm−1) and 280 nm
(pHB-ME, Δε = −3900 M−1 cm−1).
Differential scanning ﬂuorimetry. For the analysis of ligand binding to MHE-
Tase, DSF was used. Experiments were conducted with a Prometheus NT.48
(NanoTemper, Munich, Germany). The device has aﬁxed excitation wavelength of
285 nm and emission wavelengths of 330 and 350 nm. MHETase (wt) was always
used at 100 µgmL
−1 in theﬁnal solution. Final buffer concentrations were 100 mM
TRIS pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl with or without 20% DMSO. High sensitivity capil-
laries as provided by NanoTemper were used. The temperature range 20 to≥80 °C
was scanned at 0.5 K per min. Ligands were prepared in 21.7 mM stock solutions
and diluted to 10 mMﬁnal concentration. The saturated solution (with 0 or 42.5%
DMSO) was used as stock, if the compounds did not fully dissolve. For compounds
hindering reliable measurements by absorption (4-nitrophenol, 4-nitrothiophenol,
2-hydroxybenzoic acid) orﬂuorescence (BHET) 1 mMﬁnal concentrations were
also tested. Tm values are reported as provided by the Prometheus software

(maximum of the slope for theI330 nm/I350 nm ratio). The experiment was per-
formed as a single measurement.
Sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree. Protein homology searches for
MHETase-like proteins were performed with the NCBI basic local alignment
search tool (BLAST) in the ESTHER database (http://bioweb.ensam.inra.fr/
ESTHER/general?what=blast) using the Block_X.pep database22,39. Multiple
sequence alignment was performed by Muscle alignment using MEGA740. The
evolutionary history was inferred by using the Maximum Likelihood method based
on the JTT matrix-based model41. The tree with the highest log likelihood
(−19,562.87) is shown. Initial tree(s) for the heuristic search were obtained auto-
matically by applying Neighbor-Join and BioNJ algorithms to a matrix of pairwise
distances estimated using a JTT model, and then selecting the topology with
superior log likelihood value. The analysis involved 32 amino acid sequences. All
positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. There was a total of
376 positions in theﬁnal dataset. Evolutionary analyses were conducted in
MEGA740.
