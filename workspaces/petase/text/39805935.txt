Efficient monitoring of the enzymatic PET-hydrolysis is crucial for developing novel plastic-degrading 
biocatalysts. Herein, we aimed to upgrade in terms of accuracy the analytical methods useful for 
monitoring enzymatic PET-degradation. For the HPLC-based assessment, the incorporation of 
an internal standard within the analytic procedure enabled a more accurate quantification of the 
overall TPA content and the assessment of molar distributions and relative content of each aromatic 
degradation product. The provided calibration curves cover a broad concentration range, from µM 
to low mM scale, facilitating assessment of both lower and higher PETase activities, with a limit of 
detection positioned below the reported PET-degrading activities. The increased reproducibility and 
accuracy of the improved HPLC method, compared to the previous methods, was supported by lower 
dispersion of product concentrations and their lower deviation from theoretical values over multiple 
measurements. The other predominantly employed UV-spectroscopy assay was also improved in 
terms of employed wavelength and medium extinction coefficient of the three aromatic degradation 
products, while being cross-validated by the improved HPLC method. Finally, both methods were used 
for monitoring the product formation within the leaf-branch compost cutinase (LCC)-mediated PET-
hydrolysis and provided individual time-productivity profiles for each aromatic degradation product.
Due to its various advantageous properties, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the most widely produced 
polyesters1–3. Considering the annual production of ~ 400 million tons of plastic in 2022, estimated to increase to 
~ 1 billion tons/year in 2050, while calculating with the current recyclability rates, the amount of plastics present 
in landfills or in the natural environment is expected to reach 12 billion tons by 2050 2–7, representing a major, 
global environmental threat 8. The degradation-based fragmentation of polyethylene terephthalate, induced 
by physical abrasion, UV light, heat and microbial action 9, leads to PET micro- and nanoparticles that are 
omnipresent, being detected in surface waters, deep-sea sediments, air 10–13, and even human blood 14,15, while 
related toxicity issues are emergently reported1. Considering all, the degradation, depolymerization of PET to its 
monomers, that, besides recycled PET, also serves for other commodities, is highly desirable. During the large-
scale employed thermomechanical recycling, the decrease in PET’s mechanical properties occurs, limiting the 
number of recycling cycles16. Through the chemical 17 or enzymatic18 depolymerisation, the chemical building 
blocks from the PET waste can be recovered, which can replace virgin monomers during their (re)polymerisation 
into PET. The process aligns with the concept of circular economy and decreases the need for the fossil-based 
terephthalic acid, moreover the obtained monomers and/or dimers, trimers, besides (re)polymerisation, can 
possess additional valorisation possibilities19.
In 2005, the possibility of enzymatic hydrolysis of PET films was firstly reported 20, followed by further 
significant efforts to provide industrially feasible biocatalytic PET-depolymerization by the use of hydrolases, 
such as lipases, cutinases, and later PETases 2,3,21–26. Nevertheless, one of the main obstacles in biodegradation 
remained the inaccessibility of the amorphous domains of the PET polymer for the enzymatic attack. In this 
context, enzyme variants with improved thermal stability, operating with high activity at the glass transition 
temperature of PET, such as the leaf-branch compost cutinase (LCC) 21,27, became potent candidates for PET 
depolymerisation. While the biocatalytic degradation of microplastics in different environmental samples 
has just started to be explored 28, the engineered variants of LCC 29 are already employed within the industrial 
biotechnological PET depolymerisation, a back-to-monomer recycling process of CARBIOS18.
Monitoring the hydrolysis activity of PETases is also a challenging endeavour, given the necessity to 
quantify several major products such as terephthalic acid (TPA), 2-hydroxyethyl terephthalate (MHET), and 
bis(hydroxyethyl terephthalate) (BHET), along with ethylene glycol (EG) (Fig. 1)30. Regarding the quantification

of EG, colorimetric methods are included in the US Pharmacopeia 31, while gas- or liquid-chromatography 
techniques have also been developed based on the analysis of the benzoyl chloride-derivatized ethylene 
glycol32–34. The detection and quantification of PET-degradation products, by fluorimetric 30,35 and pH-based 
colorimetric methods30,36, is limited to TPA detection, which is not in all cases the predominant product of 
hydrolysis. The isothermal calorimetry titration method measures the heat liberated during the cleavage of the 
ester bond, allowing the real-time monitoring of the enzymatic PET-hydrolysis37, while being more suitable for 
kinetic measurements. Thus, for facile activity or conversion measurements of the enzymatic PET-degradation, 
predominantly UV-spectroscopy or HPLC methods are used 2,3,21,26,29,38–41. In case of the bulk absorbance 
method41, linear absorbance profiles were established only for TPA and MHET at 260 nm and the quantitative 
determination of the total product is provided by an 1.3-fold under- or overestimation if using the extinction 
coefficients either for MHET or for TPA, respectively. Several published HPLC methods monitor the overall 
TPA content (including, besides TPA, also the contents of MHET and BHET as TPA equivalents – TPAeq) of the 
reaction mixture, quantified by calibration curves based on the integration of peak area, corresponding to the 
three different aromatic degradation products20,25,27.
Within this study, we focused on improving the analytical methods used for the enzymatic PET-degradation 
activity assessment. The HPLC method was improved by using an internal standard and provided increased 
accuracy for the determination of the overall TPA content. This upgraded method allows the assessment of 
the molar percentage of each aromatic degradation product within the reaction mixture as well. Improvements 
for the bulk absorbance method have been also approached, while both optimized assays were validated and 
compared to the reported procedures in terms of reproducibility and accuracy. Finally, the applicability of the 
refined methods for monitoring the enzymatic PET-degradation was tested by assessing the product formation 
within the LCC-mediated PET-hydrolysis. By improving the activity assessment of PET-degrading enzymes, 
their performance-based comparison and selection are also facilitated, which enables precise selection of the 
optimal biocatalyst for a specific application of the PET-hydrolysis reaction.
Experimental part
Materials
The standard commercial chemicals and solvents were obtained from Sigma Aldrich or Alfa-Aesar. The PET film, 
bis-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) and tris(hydroxymethyl)aminomethane (TRIS) were purchased from 
Sigma-Aldrich (USA). Terephthalic acid (TPA) was purchased from Alfa Aesar, while mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) 
terephthalic acid (MHET) was synthesized following the reported procedure 40. HPLC-grade solvents were 
purchased from Promochem LGC Standards (Germany). The gene encoding LCC, codon-optimized for 
expression in E. coli cells (Sect. 1 in Supplementary information) were synthesized by GenScript Biotech (The 
Netherlands). UV-Vis measurements were performed on an Agilent 8453 UV-vis spectrophotometer and/
or BioTek Epoch 2 microplate reader, using 96-well UV-Microtiter microplates. Enzymatic PET-hydrolysis 
reactions were carried out in an Eppendorf ThermoMixer C, while HPLC analysis of reaction samples was 
conducted on an Agilent 1200 instrument.

form (Supplementary Table S1) from GenScript Biotech (The Netherlands), was cloned into pET-21a(+) vector, 
and was expressed in E. coli Rosetta (DE3) pLysS, while the N-terminal His 10-tagged LCC was isolated using 
previously reported procedures21,26,29,38–41 (for details see Sect. 2 in Supplementary Information).

HPLC method development
For the separation of the aromatic products of the enzymatic PET-degradation reaction (TPA, MHET, BHET) 
and the internal standard caffeine (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S4) several reverse-phase HPLC methods were 
tested. The optimal baseline separation was provided by the use of Phenomenex Luna C8(2) 5 μm, 4.6 × 150 mm 
column, with a gradient elution using water (0.1% formic acid) and acetonitrile with 15 vol% to 27.5 vol% 
increase of acetonitrile (MeCN) in 10 min, at a flow-rate of 1 mL/min, with 240 nm as detection wavelength.
HPLC calibration for quantitative assessments  The calibration curves were prepared using several mixtures 
(> 10 samples) with variable concentrations (covering a range of 0.02 to 1.7 mM—as presented in Fig.  1b and 
Supplementary Fig. S5) of the authentic TPA, MHET and BHET and fixed, 2.11 mM concentration of the caf -
feine internal standard in each calibrator sample. 5 µL of each calibrator sample was analyzed by HPLC using 
the developed internal standard method, while the calibration curves were generated by plotting the ratios of the 
areas of the absorbance peak of each reaction product and of caffeine against the known concentration of each 
product within the analyzed calibrator sample.
Enzymatic activity assessment by HPLC Internal standard-based method: to 180 µL of reaction sample, taken 
from the enzymatic PET-degradation, 180 µL acetonitrile was added, followed by centrifugal filtration (4 min, 
8000 rpm, 6200 × g) using spin centrifuge columns with 0.2 μm nylon membrane. Subsequently, into the filtered 
sample 6 µL of 22% HCl and 60 µL of 15 mM caffeine stock solution (in MeCN) was added to a final concentra-
tion of 2.11 mM. From the obtained samples, 5 µL was subjected to HPLC analysis, in triplicate. The total TPA 
content (TPA, MHET and BHET) of the reaction samples, and the correlated enzyme activity was determined 
using the calibration curves from Section “HPLC calibration for quantitative assessments”.
HPLC analysis without internal standard—conventional method : 50 µL of reaction sample taken from the 
enzymatic PET-hydrolysis were quenched with 50 µL of MeCN. The solutions were filtered via centrifugation 
(4 min, 8000 rpm, 6200 × g), using spin centrifuge columns with 0.2 μm nylon membrane, followed by acidulation 
with 22% HCl (to achieve pH 1.0). The obtained samples were analysed using the HPLC method described in 
Section “HPLC calibration for quantitative assessments” , except ommitting the use of internal standard.
Enzymatic activity assessment by UV-spectroscopy
The UV-absorbance spectra of the aromatic PET-hydrolysis products (TPA, MHET and BHET) were recorded 
using their 0.1 mM solutions in phosphate buffer (100 mM K2HPO4 – KH2PO4, pH 8.0) (Fig. 3a). The individual 
extinction coefficient for each aromatic component, TPA, MHET and BHET, was determined using absorbance 
measurements at 235 nm (A235) over a concentration range from 0.03 mM to 0.3 mM in a final volume of 200 µL 
of phosphate buffer (Supplementary Fig. S8).
For the enzymatic activity measurements, 10 µL of the reaction mixture was diluted with phosphate buffer 
(pH 8.0) to a final volume of 200 µL, and the absorbance value was determined at 235 nm (or at 260 nm). In cases 
where the absorbance values of the samples exceeded the linear range of the absorbance measurement provided 
by the instrument (in our case absorbance values above 2.5 AU), the samples were diluted with an appropriate 
volume of phosphate buffer. The blank was measured using 200 µL of phosphate buffer. Subsequently, to determine 
the total TPA content of the analysed samples, the average value (
−
ϵ ) of the three extinction coefficients (Fig. 3a 
and Supplementary Fig. S8) (or the reported value41 in case of the A260 measurements) was used.
LCC-mediated enzymatic degradation of PET films
7  mg of commercial PET film was incubated in 1 mL phosphate buffer (100 mM K 2HPO4 – KH 2PO4, 
pH 8.0) containing 10  µg of purified LCC. The reaction mixture was incubated at 65  °C, at 700  rpm in an 
Eppendorf ThermoMixer C. Samples were taken at various reaction times, from 1 to 114 h and analysed by 
HPLC or UV-absorbance measurements as described in Section “Enzymatic activity assessment by HPLC” and 
Section “Enzymatic activity assessment by UV-spectroscopy” , respectively.
Results and discussion
Several published HPLC methods, employed for the analysis of PET-hydrolysis products (Fig.  1a), determine 
the overall TPA content (including also TPA equivalents calculated from the MHET and BHET contents) by 
calibration curves based on the integration of the peak areas of the three different aromatic PET-degradation 
products20,25,27. To increase the precision and accuracy of the HPLC method, we tested the use of caffeine 
as the internal standard. The simultaneous measurement of the analyte(s) of interest and of the internal 
standard, added at known concentration and in equal amount to all analyzed samples, reduces the deviation 
within the quantitative assessments of the analyte’s concentration. The potential differences among the sample 
preparation and analysis provide similar changes to the internal standard’s signal as to those occurring in the 
analyte’s signal intensities. Therefore, a calibration curve exhibiting the relationship between the ratios of the 
internal standard’s and analyte’s signals versus their corresponding concentrations, diminishes the effect of 
modifications in analyte/analysis conditions on the peak area of individual signals. Accordingly, compared to 
the quantification of individual signals, the use of internal standard provides a more accurate determination 
of the analyte’s concentration41,42. The high accessibility of caffeine, its inertness towards PET and enzymatic 
PET-degradation products, its highly efficient separation by HPLC procedures from other aromatic compounds, 
good quantifiability and its linear response range between 0.1625 and 0.4875 mg/mL43–45 have been the starting 
point for its use as internal standard. The polar functional groups and aromatic moiety of caffeine, similar to 
those of TPA, MHET, and BHET, enabled its retention and elution by reverse-phase HPLC. At the same time, its 
structural differences provided caffeine a distinct retention time from those of PET-degradation products and 
facilitated its reliable detection and efficient separation from the reaction products (Fig. 1b and Supplementary

Fig. S4). Resolution is a crucial parameter during HPLC method development, a major driving force being 
the reach of high resolution in short elution times. A resolution value > 1.5 between two consecutive peaks 
ensures that the sample components are well separated (baseline separation) and enable precise determination 
of each peak’s area. In the developed HPLC method (Fig.  1b), the highest resolution value was 9.64, while the 
lowest value between two consecutive peaks was 3.99 (Supplementary Table S3), near an elution time less than 
10 minutes, demonstrating its further applicability for quantitative measurements.
For quantitative assessments, using the authentic samples of caffeine and the three aromatic products of the 
PET-hydrolysis (TPA, MHET and BHET), and a reverse-phase HPLC method with baseline separation of each 
component (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Fig. S5), we provided calibration curves allowing quantification of each 
individual aromatic product of the enzymatic PET-hydrolysis (Fig. 2). To minimize the influence of the sample 
matrix on the analyte’s signal, we ensured that the calibrator samples shared identical composition with the 
samples taken from the enzymatic reaction. Since acetonitrile is used to stop the enzyme’s activity within the 
samples taken from the PET-degradation reaction, therefore within the calibration samples a constant v/v ratio 
of 1:1 of the phosphate reaction buffer and acetonitrile was maintained, as within the analyzed reaction samples. 
The concentration range, from approximately 21 µM to 1.69 mM (of each aromatic component), covered by the 
calibration curves, enables the assessment of highly active and also less efficient PET-degrading enzyme variants. 
For instance, using the LCC variants 42,46 or FAST-PETase under destabilization conditions25,42,46, the reported 
product concentration was ∼500 µM and ∼200 µM, respectively, which is well within the concentration range 
covered by our calibration curves. In case if the measured quantity of the overall product, generally assessed as 
TPA equivalent2,3,21,26,29,38–41, comprising besides the TPA concentration also the MHET and BHET content (in 
TPAeq), exceeds the concentration range of the calibration curve, sample dilution can be applied. The level of 
baseline noise was of 5.73 mAU, while its 3-fold extension revealed a limit of detection of 17.20 mAU, equivalent 
to 0.49 µM of TPA, 0.40 µM of MHET and 0.21 µM of BHET. These product concentrations are at least ∼
400-fold lower than the reported content of PET-degradation products, mentioned above in case of the PET-
degrading enzyme variants 25,42,46, thus supporting the applicability of our method for monitoring the PET 
degradation reaction.
Within the linear regression model, the calibration curve on the entire concentration range, showed a 
coefficient of determination of R 2
TPA = 0.9939 (Supplementary Fig. S6a), R2
MHET = 0.9879 (Supplementary Fig. 
S6b), R2
BHET = 0.9961 (Supplementary Fig. S6c) with a slight break of linearity. By splitting the calibration curves 
for lower and higher concentrations, the accuracy and reliability slightly increased, with R 2 > 0.999 in all cases 
(Fig. 2a and b). The average slopes of the calibration curves obtained for the separated concentration ranges, 
exhibit a difference, e.g. in case of BHET concentration exceeding 19%, when compared to the values obtained 
for the total concentration range (Supplementary Table S4), further justifying the separation of the curves.
To test and compare the reproducibility and the accuracy of the developed method with the previously 
employed HPLC methods, we analyzed a particular sample with defined TPA, MHET and BHET content over 
three different days. In each day three measurements were performed, representing three technical replicates, 
yielding the measured concentration ( Cmeasured) for each day and the average concentration (
−
Cmeasured) 
across the three days. As Table 1 indicates, the standard deviation values (STD) among the technical replicates 
were in all cases higher for the HPLC method lacking the internal standard, referred here as the conventional 
method (HPLCconv.). In some cases, such as the determination of MHET concentration on day 3, the STD of the 
conventional method was > 10-fold higher than the one registered for the internal standard method and reached 
an unacceptable 46% of the determined concentration value. For the TPA content measured on day 1 and 2, the 
STD values of the conventional method (HPLC conv.), were > 2-fold higher compared to the values determined 
by the novel method.

by representing the ratios of peak areas specific to each product and caffeine as a function of the molar 
concentration of the products: (a) calibration curve for the high, mM-concentration range (0.176–1.690 mM) 
of the products; (b) calibration curve for the low, µM-concentration range (21–211 µM) of the products.

To further validate the novel method, additional performance parameters, such as coefficient of variation 
(CV), accuracy and precision were also determined (Table 1). The coefficient of variation (CV) is a dimensionless 
value, appropriate for comparing two data sets based on the degree of variation. It is defined as the ratio of 
standard deviation to the mean value and should be < 20% for a method to be accepted47. The internal standard 
method developed by us showed considerably lower variations, with CV values ranging from 1.43 to 12.51, 
whereas the conventional method showed significantly higher coefficients of variation, up to 58.83. Accuracy, 
expressed as a percentage, is determined by subtracting the calculated error values from 100 48 and indicates 
the proximity of measured values to the theoretical ones. In this case the theoretical values were the theoretical 
concentrations ( Ctheoretical) of the three analytes, TPA, MHET, BHET, controlled within the analyzed sample 
by weighting from their authentic samples. In case of MHET and BHET, the conventional method (HPLCconv.) 
exhibited significantly higher errors ( >22%) compared to the values provided by the internal standard method 
(HPLCint.std.), which presented only 6.6% and 1.8% deviation, respectively, from the ‘real’ MHET and BHET 
concentrations of the sample. Regarding TPA, the novel method showed ~ 6% deviation from the set-up TPA 
concentration in comparison with the ~ 10% error of the conventional method. Accordingly, the accuracy of 
our internal standard method exceeded 93.4% in case of each PET-degradation product. At the same time, 
the conventional method achieved its highest accuracy of 89.6% in case of TPA content determinations, with 
accuracy values of only 76.8% and 77.4% for MHET and BHET, respectively. Consequently, the precision of 
the method, expressed as a percentage of the standard deviation, was also superior for the internal standard-
containing HPLC method, with the lowest value of 1.4% being registered in case of BHET content determinations. 
These results highlight that procedures based solely on the determination of the absolute value of the peak area 
specific to each individual product are subjected to peak area variations among the multiple injections of the 
same sample, which contributes to their higher error, low accuracy and precision values (Table  1). In contrast, 
the internal standard method using ratios of peak areas normalized to the peak area of the internal standard, 
employed in constant concentration, minimizes the overall calculation error, since any factor influencing the 
peak area of the analyte affects also that of the internal standard.
The second most predominantly employed monitoring method for enzymatic PET-hydrolysis is based on 
UV-spectroscopy. Within this bulk absorbance method41, the absorbance value of the aromatic PET-degradation 
products – TPA, MHET and BHET – is registered at the wavelength of 260 nm, while for quantifications the 
medium extinction coefficient derived only from the individual coefficients of MHET and of TPA have been 
employed. In our experiments, the absorbance scan of the three aromatic PET-degradation products, at their 
identical concentrations of 0.1 mM, presented significant variation of their absorbance intensities at 260 nm

(Fig. 3a). Accordingly, determining the TPAeq content by using the medium extinction coefficient determined 
at 260 nm might lead to an under- or overestimation of the TPA eq, the extent of which depends on the molar 
percentage of the different products within the analysed sample. Based on the obtained overlaid absorbance 
spectra (Fig. 3a) of TPA, MHET and BHET, we selected 235 nm as optimal wavelength for product monitoring. 
The mean extinction coefficient was determined from the three extinction coefficients (Fig.  3a), assessed by 
using authentic samples of each product (TPA, MHET, and BHET – Supplementary Fig. S8c). Since, the average 
molar absorptivity positions close (~ 5% higher) to those of TPA, the method is likely to be highly accurate for 
samples with large molar content of TPA. However, for samples with large MHET and BHET content, the 37% 
and 42% difference, respectively, between the average molar absorptivity and those of BHET and MHET, might 
lead to increased errors in the quantification of the global TPA content, provided by these bulk-absorbance 
methods.
For validation of the developed methods, we monitored the PET-degrading activity of the recombinant leaf-
branch compost cutinase (LCC), reported as one of the most efficient PET-degrading enzymes 29,30,35,42. The 
recombinant LCC enzyme was cloned and purified using a previously described method29, while its activity was 
assessed employing the recently published optimized reaction conditions46. The specific activity of the wild-type 
enzyme was monitored utilizing both HPLC methods tested above (HPLCconv. and HPLCint.std.). Additionally, to 
cross-validate the activity values, the reported UV-spectroscopy method41 and its herein optimized variant were 
also employed for activity measurements, serving as further comparative basis. The activity of the recombinant 
LCC, determined by the internal standard HPLC method was ∼66 (µmol TPAeq/h/mg enzyme) and ∼93 (µmol 
TPAeq/h/mg enzyme), after 46- and 114-hours reaction time, respectively (Fig. 3b and c). These values are similar 
to the reported values of ∼72 (µmol TPAeq/h/mg enzyme)27 after 24 h of reaction time, while somewhat higher 
than the recently reported specific activities of ∼17.31 (µmol TPAeq/h/mg enzyme) and ∼11.96 (µmol TPAeq/h/
mg enzyme) after 26- and 46-h reaction time42.
Interestingly, the LCC activity of ∼4.48 (µmol TPAeq/h/mg enzyme), ∼67.38 (µmol TPAeq/h/mg enzyme) 
and ∼99.99 (µmol TPAeq/h/mg enzyme) after 24,46 and 114 h reaction time, respectively, measured by our 
improved UV-spectroscopy method, highly resembled the activity values determined by the internal standard 
HPLC procedure ( ∼4.49 µmol TPA eq/h/mg enzyme, ∼65.61 µmol TPA eq/h/mg enzyme and ∼93.17 µmol 
TPAeq/h/mg enzyme; see Fig.  3c). Accordingly, the optimized bulk absorbance method provides a facile 
alternative for the precise determination of the TPA content of the product mixture obtained from the PET 
degradation. In contrast, the reported bulk-absorbance procedure (UV-A 260) provided an activity value of ∼
25 (µmol TPAeq/h/mg enzyme) after 46-hours reaction time (Fig.  3c), representing a sub-estimation of 61.6% 
and 72.6% of the total TPA content measured by the internal standard-based and conventional HPLC methods, 
respectively.
Finally, we monitored the efficiency of the PET-hydrolysis (Supplementary Fig. S10) over an extended period 
of 56 h, providing the time-productivity profile of the reaction (Fig. 3b). The results showed high similarities to 
recently published data, with 25 mM product concentration (as TPA eq) reported after 50 h of reaction time 42, 
while in our case in same reaction time 36 mM TPA eq concentration was determined. The reported reactions 
also exhibit a lag period (with low productivity in time) for the experiments performed at 60 ◦ C or below, 
followed by a significant productivity increase, similar to our case. The increased lag period, also present in our 
experiments, might be due to the known issues related to the influence of the crystallinity degree of the PET film. 
Excluding the initiation / lag-time, after ∼40-hour reaction time, the product concentration reached ∼650 µM

(Fig. 3c), the specific activity values of LCC approaching the reported data25,42,46. Notably, our developed internal 
standard-based HPLC method also enables the quantification of the individual distribution of TPA, MHET and 
BHET over the reaction time (Fig.  3b), providing detailed product distribution profile of the PET-hydrolysis 
reaction.
Conclusions
The precise monitoring of enzymatic PET-hydrolysis and the relative content of the different degradation 
products is of high interest in developing novel biocatalysts for the efficient PET-degradation and recycling. 
Within this study, the methods used for monitoring the enzymatic PET-degradation have been significantly 
improved in terms of accuracy. Using caffeine as internal standard we provided an improved HPLC method, 
that besides the increased accuracy in the assessment of the overall TPA content, also allowed the determination 
of the molar distribution and the relative content of each aromatic reaction product of the enzymatic PET-
hydrolysis, namely TPA, MHET, BHET. The established calibration curves cover a broad concentration range 
(from the µM to low mM scale) of the PET-hydrolysis products. Therefore, the method is suitable for assessing 
both low and high PETase activities, having a limit of detection ~ 400-fold below the reported PET-degrading 
activities of LCC and FAST-PETase, two of the best performing PET-hydrolases. This internal standard-based 
HPLC method, when compared to previously employed methods, provided lower dispersion of product 
concentrations from multiple measurements, lower deviations from theoretical values, lower degrees of variation 
and of errors and higher accuracy as well. The HPLC method was also employed for monitoring the progress 
of the PET-hydrolysis reaction catalysed by LCC, in which case the assessed global TPA content was similar to 
the reported values. Additionally, to the reported data, our method enabled the determination of the individual 
time-productivity profile of each aromatic reaction product, demonstrating its high utility in monitoring the 
enzymatic PET-hydrolysis.
Besides, the second most predominantly employed UV-Vis bulk absorbance method was also improved and 
used for cross-validating the activity values obtained with the improved HPLC method. The specific activity 
values of the LCC provided by the two methods were highly similar, in contrast to the values provided by the 
known UV-assay, supporting the superiority of the herein fine-tunned UV-procedure to the previously reported 
spectrophotometric methods.
Accordingly, by revisiting and optimizing HPLC and UV-spectroscopy methods, herein we provide two 
facile analytical assays for the accurate monitoring of the enzymatic PET-hydrolysis. At the same time, the 
developed HPLC method allows the assessment of individual time-productivity profiles for each aromatic PET-
degradation product.
