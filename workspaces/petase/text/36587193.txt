Abstract 
Background: Over the 70 years since the introduction of plastic into everyday items, plastic waste has become an 
increasing problem. With over 360 million tonnes of plastics produced every year, solutions for plastic recycling and 
plastic waste reduction are sorely needed. Recently, multiple enzymes capable of degrading PET (polyethylene tere‑
phthalate) plastic have been identified and engineered. In particular, the enzymes PETase and MHETase from Ideonella 
sakaiensis depolymerize PET into the two building blocks used for its synthesis, ethylene glycol (EG) and terephthalic 
acid (TPA). Importantly, EG and TPA can be re‑used for PET synthesis allowing complete and sustainable PET recycling.
Results: In this study we used Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a species utilized widely in bioindustrial fermentation pro‑
cesses, as a platform to develop a whole‑cell catalyst expressing the MHETase enzyme, which converts monohydroxy‑
ethyl terephthalate (MHET) into TPA and EG. We assessed six expression architectures and identified those resulting 
in efficient MHETase expression on the yeast cell surface. We show that the MHETase whole‑cell catalyst has activity 
comparable to recombinant MHETase purified from Escherichia coli. Finally, we demonstrate that surface displayed 
MHETase is active across a range of pHs, temperatures, and for at least 12 days at room temperature.
Conclusions: We demonstrate the feasibility of using S. cerevisiae as a platform for the expression and surface display 
of PET degrading enzymes and predict that the whole‑cell catalyst will be a viable alternative to protein purification‑
based approaches for plastic degradation.

Background
Since its invention over 70 years ago, plastic has become 
a major material for a wide range of items ranging from 
electronics components to clothing and packaging. It is 
currently estimated that over 360 million metric tonnes 
of plastics are produced every year [1, 2]. In particular, 
the ease of production, cheap cost, and material versa -
tility has made polyethylene terephthalate (PET) one of 
the most abundant plastics globally, with over 56 mil -
lion metric tonnes produced every year, mainly for use in 
food packaging and textile fibers [1]. PET is easily pro -
duced by esterification of the petrochemicals ethylene

glycol and terephthalic acid leading to the formation of 
polymers which can be easily molded into shape via melt-
ing processing, a process invented in the 1970’s [3].
Despite the enormous production of PET plastic, 
current solutions for waste management are lacking and 
it is estimated that at least 70% of total plastic is found as 
waste [1]. Two limitations account for the lack of effective 
plastic recycling solutions. First, recycling technologies 
for PET via physical or chemical processes leads to loss 
of material cohesion. Second, the current physical- and/
or chemical-based methods of plastic recycling are 
not energy efficient as they involve high temperatures 
and high pressures and often lead to the formation of 
hazardous byproducts, making them incompatible with 
environmentally conscious recycling approaches [1]. 
In addition, an increasing number of studies have shed 
light on the impact of plastic waste on animal and human 
health. Micro- and nano-plastics accumulate in animals 
from mollusc species to humans [4–6]. Although the 
physiological effects of these particles remain to be fully 
understood, recent studies suggest negative effects on 
biological functions such as oyster reproduction and 
hepatic lipid metabolism in mice [7, 8]. Therefore, new 
methods for plastic waste management, remediation, and 
recycling are urgently needed.
Recently, enzymes capable of degrading PET plastic 
have been identified and engineered. In particular, 
the enzymes PETase and MHETase from the bacteria 
Ideonella sakaiensis, isolated from PET-polluted 
environmental samples, depolymerize PET into the two 
building blocks used for its synthesis, ethylene glycol 
(EG) and terephthalic acid (TPA) [9, 10]. Importantly, 
EG and TPA obtained via enzymatic hydrolysis can 
be re-used for PET synthesis allowing complete and 
sustainable PET recycling [11, 12]. The use of PETase and 
MHETase as catalysts for PET degradation at industrial 
scale could prove to be more eco-friendly and sustainable 
than physical or chemical PET recycling, as is often the 
case for bio-catalysts [13–15].
Much current work has focused on improving PETase 
through protein engineering. Computational redesign 
of PETase has led to the development of thermostable 
variants of this mesophilic enzyme that are active at 
temperature close to the glass transition of PET, which 
increases polymer chain mobility to promote access 
to the ester linkages by the enzyme [11, 16, 17]. One 
recent and notable example of such approaches led to 
the identification of a new variant of PETase, dubbed 
FAST-PETase, containing 4 thermo-stabilizing muta -
tions, boosting degradation efficiency up to 30-fold, 
and allowing degradation of entire post-consumer 
plastic containers in a matter of days [11]. Other stud -
ies have focused on identifying other PET degrading 
enzymes. Most examples involve enzymes from the 
cutinase, esterase and lipase families and were identi -
fied in bacteria and fungi. TfH (lipase), LCC, PHL7, 
HiC and Thc_Cut2 (cutinases) are among the other 
most promising PET-degrading enzymes and have been 
extensively characterized and engineered [12, 18–22].
Although most research efforts have been focused 
on enzyme identification and enzyme engineering for 
use in the context of industrial processes using purified 
enzyme, microbe engineering for PET degradation and 
remediation has also been conducted. Heterologous 
expression of PET-degrading enzymes has been 
achieved in bacteria, yeast, and microalgae [23]. 
Pseudomonas putida has been extensively studied for 
use in PET degradation due to its ability to metabolize 
EG, making this organism a potential platform for PET 
conversion into biomass. Engineered strains of P. putida 
have also been used in the upcycling of TPA into higher 
value chemicals such as biodegradable plastics [24, 25]. 
Other examples of TPA upcycling include conversion 
into catechol, muconic acid, glycolic acid, and vanillic 
acid [26, 27]. More recently, Pichia pastoris was shown 
to be a suitable platform for expression of PETase and 
Yarrowia lypolitica was shown to naturally degrade 
PET and metabolize EG and TPA [28– 31].
Despite the focus on PETase, MHETase is 
also a critical component of the enzymatic PET 
degradation process and is essential for converting 
the monohydroxyethyl terephthalate (MHET) 
product of the PETase reaction into TPA and EG. The 
PETase reaction products consist mainly of MHET, 
with TPA produced in small quantities if PETase is 
expressed alone [9 ]. MHET accumulation inhibits 
PET-hydrolysing enzymes [32, 33] reducing their 
effectiveness, whereas dual systems such as fusion 
of PETase and MHETase improve PET hydrolysis 
[34]. Consequently, biological systems for MHETase 
expression and engineering are needed.
In this study, we establish a system to express 
MHETase from Ideonella sakaiensis on the surface 
of the yeast Saccharomyces  cerevisiae. The resulting 
whole-cell biocatalyst allows conversion of MHET gen -
erated by PETase into TPA and EG (Fig.  1A). We sur -
veyed six potential surface display partners to identify 
a system that expresses MHETase at high density on 
the cell surface, and demonstrated that the resulting 
whole-cell catalyst hydrolyses MHET without the need 
for purification of the MHETase enzyme. The activity of 
the MHETase whole-cell catalyst is similar to purified 
recombinant MHETase and the whole-cell catalyst is 
active across a range of alkaline pHs, temperatures, and 
for at least 12 days, a clear advantage over the purified 
enzyme. We anticipate that large-scale fermentation of 
Page 3 of 15

the MHETase whole-cell biocatalyst will provide a low-
cost source of MHETase suitable for PET plastic recy -
cling, up-cycling, and remediation.
Results and discussion
MHETase cell surface display modules
Our goal was to develop a system expressing the 
MHETase enzyme, from I.  sakaiensis, in S.  cerevisiae  
to process the PET-hydrolysis intermediate MHET 
(Fig.  1A). Surface display is an ideal context for reac -
tions with large substrates, like PET, that cannot trans -
locate to the cell interior [35]. Additionally, surface 
display circumvents enzyme purification as a prereq -
uisite for catalysis, avoids product contamination [36], 
facilitates reuse of the catalyst, and can increase catalyst 
stability [28, 37]. We engineered a MHETase cell sur -
face display system to probe these potential advantages 
relative to conventional enzyme expression and purifi -
cation and to compare the effect of different cell surface 
anchor proteins on MHETase display efficiency and 
activity. The MHETase surface display system consists 
of an engineered transcription unit stably integrated at 
the CAN1 locus driven by a doxycycline-inducible pro -
moter (WTC846pr) [38] to express MHETase fusion 
proteins (Fig.  1B). All MHETase fusions contain: (i) 
a secretion signal (from the OST1  gene) fused to the 
N-terminus of the MHETase coding sequence, (ii) a 
yeast codon-optimized sequence of MHETase from 
I. sakaiensis followed by, (iii) the coding sequence of 
GFP , and (iv) the coding sequence of one of 6 display 
partners, AGA2, CCW12, CIS3, CWP2, SED1 or TIP1, 
which encode yeast cell wall proteins, to allow anchor -
ing of the MHETase on the yeast surface (Fig.  1B) [39]. 
The cell wall proteins used for anchoring at the cell sur -
face were chosen to span different modes of covalent 
linkage to the cell wall, different molecular weights, 
and different native expression levels. We reasoned

Fig. 1 The MHETase whole‑cell catalyst concept. A The MHETase whole‑cell catalyst performs the second step of the PET biodegradation pathway. 
In the first step, repeating units of MHET in the PET polymer are released by the enzyme PETase. MHET is then processed into TPA and ethylene 
glycol by the MHETase whole‑cell catalyst. TPA and ethylene glycol can be used to synthesize new, virgin PET, bio‑converted to high‑value 
compounds or simply converted into biomass. B Chimera design for surface display of MHETase. The coloured blocks represent the different 
components assembled to express MHETase (orange block) at the cell surface. Different cell wall proteins (CWPs; purple block) were fused to 
MHETase to identify the best design. Amino acid length is indicated, as is CWP type, and expression level for the different CWPs under their native 
promoters. Control chimeras lacking MHETase were also generated

that native abundance could indicate the natural capac -
ity for each display partner at the cell surface (Fig.  1B). 
We also designed modules driving secretion of solu -
ble MHETase or expressing intracellular MHETase, as 
controls.
Efficient expression of MHETase display chimeras in vivo
Having successfully assembled the 8 MHETase modules, 
we measured protein expression using the GFP present 
in each chimeric protein. To accurately convert GFP fluo-
rescence in  vivo to protein abundance, we assembled a 
calibrating set of strains expressing GFP-tagged proteins 
with abundance ranging from 2.3 ×  103 to 7.5 ×  105 mole-
cules/cell (Fig. 2A) [40]. The correlation between protein 
abundance and normalized GFP intensity was excellent 
 (R2 = 0.874, Fig. 2A). Using the normalized GFP intensity 
measurements for the MHETase chimeras after 4  h of 
induction, we calculated MHETase abundance in mole -
cules/cell using the calibration curve (Fig.  2B). MHETase 
chimeras were expressed at similar levels, ranging from 
9.3 ×  104 (MHETase-Tip1) to 1.5 ×  105 (MHETase-Cis3) 
molecules/cell, corresponding to MHETase concentra -
tions of 16–25  nM for cultures containing  108  cells/mL 
(Fig.  2B). The intracellular and the secreted MHETase 
were expressed at slightly higher levels (30 and 27  nM, 
respectively) compared to the MHETase display chi -
meras. When we assessed the expression level of the 
chimeras lacking MHETase, it became apparent that the 
MHETase sequence reduced protein expression, except 
for the Ccw12 fusion (Fig.  2B). It is possible that the dis -
play partners, except Ccw12, do not tolerate additional 
cargo without some reduction in protein abundance, per-
haps due to altered folding or trafficking of the display 
partner. We compared growth of the strains expressing 
MHETase display chimeras with the growth of strains 
expressing GFP display chimeras. Only MHETase-Aga2 
and MHETase-Cis3 resulted in a statistically supported 
decrease in growth rate (Fig.  2C), and the effect size was 
very small (approximately 5% decrease in growth rate). 
We conclude that MHETase expression is not toxic to the 
yeast platform.
An image analysis pipeline to quantify surface‑displayed 
proteins
Total MHETase abundance does not accurately reflect 
the enzyme concentration at the cell surface. Secreted 
proteins can be retained intracellularly, reducing the 
amount of catalyst that is able to contact substrate out -
side of the cell, although display of cargos often has effi -
ciency above 50% [41]. We developed a computational 
pipeline to analyse fluorescence microscopic images of 
yeast cells expressing surface display proteins to quan -
tify the amount of protein at the cell surface relative to 
total protein expression. We imaged cells labelled with

concanavalin A conjugated to Alexa Fluor 594 (conA-
A594) which binds to glycoproteins in the cell wall. Cells 
were identified based on the conA-A594 fluorescence 
signal and concentric rings of 1 pixel width inside and 
outside the conA-A594-defined cell borders were seg -
mented (Fig.  3A). Fluorescence intensity was measured 
for each of the concentric rings. As shown in Fig.  3B, the 
conA-A594 fluorescence signal followed a normal dis -
tribution between 0 and −  9 pixels and peaked at −  4 
pixels, consistent with most of the signal being at the 
periphery of the cell and demonstrating that most of the 
cell wall signal is between 0 and −  9 pixels inside the 
segmented cell object (Fig.  3B). We repeated the analy -
sis with conA-A594 labelled cells expressing Mrh1-GFP , 
a plasma membrane protein displaying a homogenous 
fluorescence signal at the cell periphery, as well as the 
MHETase intracellular chimera, and two additional intra-
cellular GFP-tagged proteins, Tif2 and Rrp1A (Fig.  3D). 
Tif2 and Rrp1A are expressed at 9.2 ×  104 and 1.4 ×  105 
molecules/cell, respectively, similar to the expression 
levels of the MHETase display chimeras. As shown in 
Fig. 3B, the fluorescence intensity profile for Mrh1-GFP 
closely followed that of conA-A594 consistent with Mrh1 
residing at the cell periphery. Interestingly, the GFP sig -
nal for Mrh1-GFP peaked at the −  5 pixels coordinate, 
while the conA-A595 signal peaked at the −  4 pixels 
coordinate, indicating that our method can distinguish 
proteins at the plasma membrane from those at the cell 
wall. The Mrh1 C-terminus (including the GFP tag) is 
predicted to reside on the inner side of the plasma mem -
brane (Additional file  1: Fig. S1) consistent with the GFP 
signal being more internal to the cell compared to the 
conA-A594 signal. By contrast, the fluorescence profile 
for the intracellular GFP-proteins did not resemble that 
of conA-A594 or Mrh1-GFP (Fig.  3B). Instead, the fluo -
rescence progressively increased from the − 3 pixels ring 
and plateaued at − 6 pixels, demonstrating that most of 
the signal is more internal as compared to the peak of flu-
orescence of both the plasma membrane and cell surface 
(Fig. 3B). Even though the fluorescent signal was consist -
ent with intracellular proteins, a significant amount of 
fluorescence signal was still present within the 0 to − 9 
ring, indicating bleed-through of intracellular fluores -
cence into the cell wall ring. For example, approximately 
90% and 50% of the intracellular fluorescence intensity is 
still detected at the − 4 and − 5 rings, respectively, for all 
intracellular proteins (Fig.  3C). Because the peak of cell 
surface fluorescence spanned the 0 to − 9 pixel rings, we 
used this entire area to measure displayed abundance and 
corrected for intracellular fluorescence bleed-through 
(see “Methods” section).
MHETase is displayed efficiently at the cell surface
We determined the fraction of MHETase displayed 
at the cell surface by measuring the GFP signal at the 
cell surface relative to total GFP signal by analysis of 
fluorescence micrographs of cells expressing MHETase 
chimeras (Fig.  3E). GFP intensity was integrated for the 
0 to − 9 pixel region and corrected for background and 
intracellular fluorescence bleed-through in the cell wall 
region and expressed as a ratio to total cell integrated 
GFP intensity. The analysis was performed on at least 
200 individual cells in 6 replicates. As shown in Fig.  3F, 
between 0.16 and 0.22 of the total MHETase was 
displayed at the cell surface, depending on the display 
partner. Next, using total abundance and displayed 
fraction data (Figs.  2B, 3F), we calculated the displayed 
MHETase abundance in molecules/cell and in nanomolar 
concentration of enzyme for a suspension of cells at  108 
cells/mL. MHETase protein abundance ranged from 
1.5 ×  104 (MHETase-Tip1) to 3.0 ×  104 (MHETase-
Aga2) molecules/cell at the cell surface, corresponding 
to enzyme concentrations of 2.4–4.8  nM for  108 cell/
mL suspensions (Fig.  3G). The MHETase-Aga2 and 
MHETase-Sed1 chimeras had the highest displayed 
fraction. The displayed protein abundance was more 
variable for MHETase-Aga2, MHETase-Sed1, and 
MHETase-Cis3 as compared to the other constructs, 
suggesting that cells might not display these chimeras 
uniformly. Although the displayed abundance for the 
MHETase-Aga2 (1.5 ×  104 molecules/cell) was consistent 
with those described for Aga1-Aga2 yeast surface display 
systems [35], none of the display partners moved more 
than 22% of total MHETase to the cell surface. Display 
efficiency did not correlate with display partner MW, 
as the smallest (Aga2) and the largest (Sed1) showed 
similar efficiency. Display efficiencies of over 50% have 
been described [41], and so we infer that there remains 
substantial room to improve the efficiency of our 
MHETase yeast surface display systems.
Kinetic analysis of MHETase whole‑cell catalysts
Having established that the MHETase constructs were 
expressed and displayed on the cell surface, we tested 
whether the MHETase whole-cell biocatalyst had the 
expected catalytic activity. MHETase activity is read -
ily assayed with the colorimetric substrate MpNPT, 
and MHETase hydrolysis of MpNPT accurately reflects 
hydrolysis of MHET [32]. After 4  h of induction, cells 
expressing MHETase chimeras were incubated with 
increasing concentrations of MpNPT and pNP forma -
tion was quantified. As shown in Fig.  4A–F, all MHETase 
chimeras followed Michaelis–Menten kinetics. Differ -
ences in reaction rates and in substrate affinity were read-
ily observable between chimeras, with MHETase-Aga2

Loll‑Krippleber et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2022) 21:280 
 
performing poorly and MHETase-Tip1 having the high -
est reaction rate (Fig.  4A–F). Importantly, cells express -
ing intracellular MHETase did not hydrolyse MpNPT,

Fig. 4 The MHETase whole‑cell catalysts follow Michaelis–Menten kinetics. A–I Michaelis–Menten plots for the MHETase chimeras and 
recombinant MHETase. For the displayed MHETase chimeras (A–G), cells were induced for 4 h in YPD, rinsed twice and resuspended in 100 mM 
phosphate buffer pH 7.5 prior to assaying MHETase activity by incubating with MpNPT at the indicated concentrations for 10 min at 24 °C, 
followed by measuring absorbance at 405 nm. For the recombinant and secreted enzyme (H, I), assays were performed under the same buffer 
and temperature conditions in the presence of the indicated MpNPT concentrations. Michaelis–Menten curves were fitted to the data. J Seven 
biological replicates of the MHETase‑Tip1 fusion were assayed in parallel. Michaelis–Menten curves were fitted to each replicate (black lines).  Vmax 
and  Km were calculated from the fitted curves (inset). K Representative chromatograms from HPLC of MHETase reaction products for MHETase‑Tip1

to the displayed MHETase chimeras (Fig.  4H, I). Assays 
of 7 independent isolates of the MHETase-Tip1 chimera 
showed a high degree of reproducibility (Fig.  4J), indi -
cating that the whole-cell catalyst system is stable and 
robust to variation.
Having established that the whole-cell catalyst was 
functional on the model substrate, we assessed whether 
the MHETase whole-cell catalyst could hydrolyze its 
natural substrate MHET. We chose the MHETase-Tip1 
whole-cell catalyst as it performed well in our previous 
assays. Cells were incubated in the presence of 1  mM 
MHET (400  nmol), and TPA formation was measured 
by HPLC after 1 and 24  h of incubation (Fig.  4K). TPA 
was readily detectable after 60  min and after 24  h of 
incubation all MHET was converted to TPA (Fig.  4L). 
By contrast, little TPA was detected for the intracellular 
MHETase chimera (intra-M) even at 24  h, indicating 
that MHET hydrolysis was occurring extracellularly. We 
conclude that the whole-cell catalyst hydrolyzes MHET.
To accurately compare the different MHETase chime -
ras to purified MHETase, kinetic parameters were cal -
culated using the Michaelis–Menten plots, the enzyme 
concentration determined from total abundance, the 
display efficiency, and the cell culture density (Table  1). 
Again, differences between MHETase chimeras were 
readily observable. We found that the turnover numbers 
 (kcat) for whole-cell catalysts were similar to MHETase 
purified from E.  coli or MHETase secreted from yeast 
cells. MHETase-Tip1  kcat was 68% of purified MHETase 
and 96% of secreted MHETase (Table  1).  Km values for 
the displayed chimeras were 3.6- to 15.7-fold greater 
than purified or secreted MHETase, indicating that sur -
face display reduced the substrate affinity of MHETase. 
Consequently, catalytic efficiency for the whole-cell 
MHETase catalysts was also lower than recombinant or 
secreted MHETase.
Lower substrate affinity and catalytic efficiency could 
be due to ectopic glycosylations that are typical of 
proteins transiting through the yeast secretory pathway 
[42]. The glycosylation status of MHETase secreted from 
yeast is currently unknown, but at least 6 N-glycosylation 
sites are predicted computationally (https:// comp. chem. 
notti ngham. ac. uk/ glyco/, [43]). An alternative possibility 
is that the reduced  Km of the surface displayed chimeras 
could reflect the environment of the yeast cell surface. As 
such, mutations that alter cell surface properties could be 
reasonable targets for improving the MHETase display 
platform. Finally, the large protein fusion on MHETase 
C-terminus could reduce substrate affinity. Removing 
the GFP sequences from the MHETase display chimera 
or varying the length and flexibility of the linker between 
MHETase and the display partner are additional avenues 
worth exploring. Interestingly, no correlation was evident 
between the activity of the different chimeras and either 
the level of expression at the cell surface or the MW of 
the chimera, suggesting that the fusion partner itself or 
the mode of cell surface anchoring might be responsible 
for the catalytic efficiency differences that we observe. 
Nevertheless, the displayed MHETase chimeras differ 
only modestly from purified MHETase, and our analyses 
highlight the importance of testing multiple surface 
display partners to identify chimeras with optimal 
catalytic properties.
The MHETase whole‑cell catalyst is active across a range 
of alkaline pHs, mesophilic temperatures, and over time
We next established optimal reaction parameters for 
temperature and pH for the whole-cell catalyst. As 
shown in Fig.  5A, enzymatic activity was optimal for all 
the chimeras at pH 7.5. At higher pH (pH 9.5 and 10.5), 
the system remained active, but activity was reduced by 
approximately 40 to 50%, which contrasts with purified 
MHETase which remained active at higher pH [32]. The 
differences observed for activity at pH 7.5 between the 
different chimeras (Fig. 4) remained consistent across the

pH range, with MHETase-Tip1 being the most active and 
MHETase-Aga2 displaying the lowest activity. Similarly, 
we assessed the effect of temperature on enzyme activ -
ity. As shown in Fig.  5B, activity steadily increased and 
peaked at 45 °C for all the chimeras. At 55 °C, MHETase 
activity was lower. Therefore, of the tested temperatures, 
45 °C was optimal, with MHETase activity approximately 
threefold higher than at 24 °C. Again, differences between 
chimeras were consistent across temperatures. Purified 
recombinant MHETase also showed optimal activity at 
45  °C, in agreement with previous characterizations of 
purified MHETase [32].

Surface display systems for PETase show little loss 
of enzyme activity over 7  days [28, 44], whereas solu -
ble PETase loses activity more rapidly. We compared 
the activity of surface displayed MHETase to soluble 
purified MHETase after incubating for up to 12  days at 
room temperature in phosphate buffer. Surprisingly, 
MHETase activity increased over time, including for the 
cells expressing intracellular MHETase (Fig. 5D, compare 
day 0 with day 4 or day 12). We noticed that cell count 
decreased over the same period of time, by an average of 
2- and 6.7-fold at day 4 and day 12 (see Additional file  3), 
suggesting that cell lysis was occurring and that release 
of intracellular MHETase could be the mechanism by 
which activity was increasing. To test this hypothesis, we 
repeated MHETase assays at day 12, on cell suspensions, 
on cell pellets washed with fresh phosphate buffer, and on 
the supernatants (Fig. 5D). We observed strong activity in 
the supernatants, representing approximately 70–80% of 
enzymatic activity of the cell suspensions. All MHETase 
activity for the intracellular construct was in the superna-
tant, consistent with release due to cell lysis. We suggest 
that some caution is warranted in interpreting display 
activity results unless the whole-cell catalyst is washed 
prior to assay. Activity in the cell pellets (on a per cell 
basis) was higher at day 12 than at day 0 by approximately 
10- to 35-fold, indicating substantial increases in activity 
for the whole-cell catalyst despite considerable cell lysis 
(Fig.  5D). By contrast, soluble purified MHETase was 
inactive after 4 days at room temperature demonstrating 
that the whole-cell catalyst retains greater activity during 
prolonged incubation than the purified enzyme (Fig.  5E). 
Although cell lysis might not be desirable in a large scale 
industrial process, we note that the cells in our experi -
ment were exposed to prolonged osmotic stress and star -
vation. We expect that optimizing reaction conditions to 
minimize cell lysis should be easily achievable.
Conclusions
We have established a new system for degrading MHET, 
an important by-product of PET plastic degradation. 
Using a yeast surface display strategy and testing 
multiple display fusion partners, we demonstrate the 
production of MHETase at nanomolar concentrations 
in cell suspensions of moderate density  (108 cells/mL). 
We found that Aga2 was a poor display partner for 
MHETase. Although we note that display efficiency of 
MHETase-Aga2 was good, the  Km of MHETase-Aga2 
was 4.4-fold higher than that of MHETase-Cwp2, and 
16-fold higher than purified MHETase. We present 
alternative display partners for MHETase, including Tip1, 
Cwp2, and Sed1, that have suitable kinetic and display 
properties. MHETase whole-cell catalysts were active 
for at least 12  days and retained activity up to 45  °C. 
Stability gains relative to purified soluble MHETase when 
combined with time and cost savings realized by avoiding 
enzyme purification indicate that yeast surface display 
is a viable route for MHETase production. Finally, the 
yeast platform is amenable to synthetic biology, -omics, 
genetic, and artificial evolution strategies to improve the 
characteristics of the MHETase whole-cell catalyst.
Methods
Yeast maintenance and growth conditions
Yeast strains were maintained at 30  °C in standard rich 
(YPD; 20  g/L peptone, 20  g/L dextrose, 10  g/L yeast 
extract) or synthetic medium containing all amino acids 
(SDall; 6.7  g/L yeast nitrogen base, 20  g/L glucose). 
For MHETase induction, yeast strains were grown to 
saturation overnight in YPD and diluted sixfold in fresh 
YPD containing doxycycline at a final concentration of 
10 μg/mL. Cells were then grown for 4 h with agitation 
at 30 °C. Typical cell concentrations after 4 h of induction 
were ~  108 cell/mL. For MHETase secretion, the same 
induction scheme was used but cells were pre-grown 
in fully-supplemented synthetic medium (SDall) and 
induced in SDall containing 10 μg/mL doxycycline.
Yeast strain construction
Yeast transformation was performed using the 
standard lithium acetate procedure. For CRISPR/Cas9 
transformations, yeast cells were transformed using the 
pUB1306 plasmid (A kind gift of Elçin Ünal, originally 
generated by Gavin Schlissel and Jasper Rine) containing 
one of the following guide RNAs (CAN1 gRNA: GAT 
ACG TTC TCT ATG GAG GA; OST1-GFP gRNA: TCA 
TCG GCA ATG GTC AGT AA) and transformants 
were selected on synthetic medium lacking uracil. 
URA + transformants were then plated on 5-FOA 
medium to select against cells carrying the CRISPR/Cas9 
plasmid. Transformants were validated by PCR and GFP 
expression was confirmed microscopically.
All strains were constructed in DHY213 (a deriva -
tive of BY4741 with higher sporulation efficiency and 
improved mitochondrial function [45]) and are listed in 
Additional file  2: Table  S1. To allow doxycycline induc -
tion of the WTC846 promoter [38], DHY213 was first 
modified by integrating the linearized FRP2370 plasmid 
(Addgene #127576), which encodes a cassette expressing 
the Tet repressor, yielding strain RLKY218 (Additional 
file 2: Table S1). All subsequent strains were constructed 
in the RLKY218 background via CRISPR/Cas9 mediated 
assembly of PCR fragments at the CAN1 locus. A first set 
Page 11 of 15
Loll‑Krippleber et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2022) 21:280 
 
of strains with the following construct architecture was 
generated: WTC846pr-OST1ss-GFP-display_partner-
PRM9ter. WTC846pr is a strong doxycycline inducible 
promoter, OST1ss is the Ost1 endoplasmic reticulum 
translocation signal to allow for efficient secretion [39], 
GFP is the yeast codon-optimized monomeric GFP [46, 
47], display_partner is the coding sequence of one of 
SED1, AGA2, CCW12, CWP2, CIS3 or TIP1 lacking their 
respective secretion signals, and PRM9ter is the termi -
nator region of PRM9  (Additional file  2: Table  S2). The 
display partner sequences were codon optimized to mini-
mize chances of recombination between the endogenous 
loci and the synthetic constructs, which were integrated 
at CAN1. Codon optimization was performed using 
the “Optimize codon” function of Benchling (https:// 
www. bench ling. com/) using Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
as “Organism” . This first set of strains was then used as 
platform for integration of the yeast codon optimized 
MHETase gene from I. sakaiensis (devoid of its endog -
enous secretion signal) between the OST1ss and the 
msGFP sequence (Additional file  2: Table  S2). All DNA 
sequences described here are provided in the Additional 
file 2: Table S2.
Measuring MHETase total protein abundance
Expression was induced as described above. After 4 h of 
induction, cells were washed twice with sterile water and 
resuspended in the same volume of sterile water. 200 μL 
of cells were transferred into a clear 96-well plate and 
GFP fluorescence intensity was measured. The same cell 
suspension was diluted 10 times and used to measure 
optical density at 600  nm  (OD600). All measurements 
were made using a CLARIOstar (BMG LABTECH) plate 
reader. For each strain, GFP intensity was first corrected 
for cell mass by dividing GFP intensity by  OD600 
(GFPcorr). GFPcorr values were then expressed as a ratio 
(GFPnorm) between GFP corr for a given GFP expressing 
strain and GFP corr obtained for a GFP negative control 
strain (DHY213).
To establish a GFP standard curve, the following 
strains were obtained from the GFP strain collection [48]: 
PEX21-GFP, FMP23-GFP, MDL2-GFP, PER1-GFP, LPX1-
GFP, YML007CA-GFP, RAI1-GFP, SPI1-GFP, RTG2-
GFP, MOT2-GFP, RRP15-GFP, RET2-GFP, GCN20-GFP, 
RPC40-GFP, NEW1-GFP, ARB1-GFP, OLA1-GFP, 
RPL2A-GFP, PMP2-GFP, STM1-GFP, TIF2-GFP, HTB2-
GFP, RPS1B-GFP, RPP1A-GFP, SSA2-GFP, SSA1-GFP, 
TEF2-GFP, TEF1-GFP, PDC1-GFP, TDH3-GFP and their 
GFP fluorescence intensity was measured. Regression 
analysis was performed with GFP norm values for the GFP 
strains and the median molecules/cell data from Ho et al. 
[40], using GraphPad Prism 5. GFP norm values obtained 
for the various surface display constructs were then 
used to calculate their respective abundances using the 
regression equation determined from the GFP standard 
curve.
Measuring MHETase cell surface abundance
Cells were induced in YPD as described above. After 4 h 
of induction cells were washed in sterile water twice and 
resuspended in water containing 10 μm/mL concanavalin 
A conjugated with Alexa Fluor 594 (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific) and incubated at room temperature for 1  h. 
GFP and Alexa Fluor 594 imaging was performed on an 
Opera Phenix (Perkin Elmer) high-throughput confocal 
microscope at a focal height of 1.5 μm using 488 nm and 
561 nm excitation lasers and 500–550 nm, 570–630 nm 
bandpass emission filters. Images were analyzed with 
CellProfiler 3.1.9 (https:// cellp rofil er. org/) using the 
custom pipeline provided in the Additional file 4.
To determine the position of cell surface with respect 
to the outline of the segmented cell objects, cells 
were first identified and segmented using Alexa Fluor 
594 fluorescence images. Cell objects were further 
segmented into 10 inward and 4 outward concentric 
rings of one pixel width except for the most inward 
ring which represented the remaining inner portion of 
the cell. Median fluorescence was determined in each 
ring and corrected for background fluorescence before 
being normalized by the signal of most inner portion 
of the cell. Cell wall signal was determined as the area 
of strongest concanavalin A signal, which spanned 
a ring of 9 pixels width inside the cell object (Fig.  3B, 
conA-A594 curve). This analysis was also performed 
on cells expressing known intracellular GFP-tagged 
proteins (Rrp1a-GFP , Tif2-GFP and intra-M chimera) 
to determine the average fraction of inner fluorescence 
signal spreading into each of the cell wall rings defined 
above (Fig.  3B). The fraction of inner fluorescence was 
termed FBi (Fluorescence Bleed, where i  represents a 
given 1-pixel width ring). This parameter was used in 
the analysis below.
To determine the abundance of MHETase at the 
cell surface, the GFP intensity was integrated for the 
entire cell object and for the 9 inner rings closest to 
the cell object outer edge and expressed as a ratio 
of integrated GFP in the cell wall ring over the inte -
grated GFP for the entire cell. We refer to this ratio as 
the fraction of GFP displayed or display efficiency. To 
account for background fluorescence and intracellu -
lar bleed-through fluorescence, two normalizations 
were applied before calculating the fraction of GFP 
displayed. First, all raw integrated GFP values were 
corrected for background fluorescence as follows: 
Page 12 of 15Loll‑Krippleber et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2022) 21:280 
GFPintcorr1 = GFPinti − (GFPmed backd × Pi ), where 
GFPinti is the raw GFP integrated value for a given ring 
or the total cell, GFPmed backd is the median background 
fluorescence determined from an area of the image 
with no cells and P i the number of pixels in the area 
considered (ring or total cell). Second, bleed-through 
fluorescence was also taken into account for integrated 
GFP values of each of the 9 cell wall rings, as follows: 
GFPintcorr2 = GFPintcorr1 − (GFPmed inner× FBi × Pi)  , 
where GFPmed inner is the background corrected median 
GFP fluorescence intensity for the inner part of the cell, 
FBi is the fluorescence bleed-through correction factor 
for the area considered, as determined above, and Pi the 
number of pixels in the ring area considered. Displayed 
ratio was then calculated as the sum of GFPint corr2 val -
ues from the cell wall rings and divided by GFPint corr1 
obtained for the total cell. At least 200 cells were ana -
lyzed in each technical (n = 2) and biological replicate 
(n = 3).
Measurement of strain fitness
Fitness was measured as previously described [49]. 
Briefly, cells were grown to saturation overnight and 
diluted 100-fold in 200 μL of fresh YPD with or without 
doxycycline (10  μg/mL) in a transparent 96-well plate. 
 OD600 was monitored every 15  min in a Genios Tecan 
plate reader. Growth rate was determined in R (https:// 
www.r- proje ct. org/). Fitness was calculated as the ratio of 
the growth rate of the experimental strain to that of the 
parental strain (DHY213).
MHETase activity measurement with the whole‑cell 
biocatalyst
Induced cells were washed twice in sterile water and 
resuspended in the same volume of 111  mM phosphate 
buffer at pH 7.5 (standard assay condition), 8.5, 9.5 
or 10.5. Cell concentration was determined using a 
Beckman-Coulter Counter Z1 equipped with a 100  μm 
aperture tube using a particle lower threshold limit of 
4 μm. 270 μL of cells were mixed with 30 μL of MpNPT 
(CAS #3557-99-1, Toronto Research Chemicals) at 
ten times the final concentration in DMSO (0.07 to 
134.1  μM final concentration), and reactions were 
allowed to proceed for 10 min. The reaction was stopped 
by separating the cells from the reaction with a 96-well 
filter plate (AcroPrep, Pall) mounted on a vacuum 
device (NucleoVac 96, Macherey–Nagel). Alternatively, 
miniprep columns were used for filtering (PuroSPIN 
MINI, Luna Nanotech). 120  μL of filtered reaction 
was then transferred into a clear 384-well plate, to 
increase the light pathlength, and para -nitrophenol 
(pNP) concentration was determined by measuring 
absorbance at 405  nm in a CLARIOstar plate reader 
(BMG LABTECH). Each run included an MpNPT 
autohydrolysis control (MpNPT diluted in phosphate 
buffer only). The molar extinction coefficients at 407 nm 
for pNP at the different pH’s were calculated from Biggs 
(1954) [50] and are provided in Additional file  1: Fig. S2. 
All reactions were performed at 24  °C unless specified 
otherwise. To assess activity at different temperatures, 
cells were pre-incubated in a water bath at the given 
temperature for 10  min before addition of the substrate 
and held at the same temperature after addition of 
MpNPT. To test the activity of the whole-cell biocatalyst 
over time, induced cells were resuspended in phosphate 
buffer pH 7.5 and held for 12 days at room temperature 
without agitation.
HPLC quantification of TPA and MHET
Whole-cell catalyst was assayed using the same 
conditions as for the MpNPT substrate, except that the 
reactions contained 360  µL of cells, 40  µL of 10  mM 
MHET (CAS #1137-99-1, Advanced ChemBlocks) 
in DMSO (1  mM final concentration), and reactions 
were allowed to proceed for 1 or 24  h for MHET. 
20  µL of each reaction was fractionated on reversed-
phase HPLC to measure MHET and TPA after MHET 
hydrolysis. HPLC was performed using an HP1050 
system equipped with an autosampler, vacuum degasser, 
variable wavelength diode-array detector, and a Zorbax 
SB-C8 column (4.6 × 150  mm, 5  µm). The column was 
maintained at ~ 22  °C. The analytes were eluted over a 
40-min run with a mobile phase consisting of 1% acetic 
acid in water (aqueous solvent) and 1% acetic acid in 
acetonitrile (organic solvent) using the following solvent 
and flow rate gradients: 1–5% organic (vol/vol) over 
10  min at 0.8  mL/min, 5–52.5% organic (vol/vol) over 
20  min at 0.8  mL/min, 52.5–100% organic (vol/vol) and 
0.8–3.0 mL/min over 0.2 min, 100% organic (vol/vol) for 
3.8 min at 3.0 mL/min, 100% to 1% organic (vol/vol) and 
3.0–0.8  mL/min over 0.2  min, and 1% organic (vol/vol) 
for 5.8  min. Detection wavelength was 240  nm (signal 
wavelength = 240  nm with 4  nm bandwidth; reference 
wavelength = 450 nm with 80 nm bandwidth). A standard 
curve was prepared using commercial TPA with ≥ 98% 
purity (CAS #100-21-0, Sigma-Aldrich) or MHET ≥ 95% 
purity (CAS #1137-99-1, Advanced ChemBlocks). TPA 
and MHET peak quantification was done by calculating 
area under the A240 nm curve.
Purification, quantification, and activity measurement 
of recombinant MHETase from E. coli
Recombinant MHETase was purified as described 
previously [32] with some modifications. Escherichia

coli Shuffle T7 express cells were transformed with 
pCOLDII-MHETase vector [32] and selected on agar 
plates containing 100 μg/mL carbenicillin at 30 °C. Single 
colonies were inoculated into liquid growth medium 
containing carbenicillin and protein expression was 
induced as follows. 1L cultures were grown to an OD 
of ~ 0.5 at 30  °C, then rapidly cooled in an ice bath to 
~ 10  °C. Isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) 
was added to a final concentration of 1 mM, and cultures 
were incubated overnight at 16  °C with shaking. Cell 
pellets were collected by centrifugation at 16,770g at 
4 °C, resuspended in 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM 
NaCl, 10  mM imidazole, 1  mM DTT, and protease 
inhibitors (2  μg/mL aprotonin, 10  μM bestatin, 10  μM 
leupeptin, 1  μM pepstatin, and 0.5  mM PMSF), lysed 
by sonication and clarified by ultracentrifugation (4  °C, 
142,000g, 1  h). The clarified lysates were loaded onto a 
5 mL His-Trap FF column (Cytiva), washed with 50 mM 
Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 100  mM NaCl, 20  mM imidazole 
and 1  mM DTT, and then eluted in 50  mM Tris–HCl 
(pH 7.5), 100  mM NaCl and 500  mM imidazole. Peak 
fractions were pooled and diluted with 25  mM Tris–
HCl (pH 7.5) to a final concentration of ~ 50  mM NaCl 
before loading onto a 5  mL HiTrap Q HP column 
(Cytiva) pre-equilibrated in 25  mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 
50  mM NaCl. The column was then washed using 10 
column volumes of 25  mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 50  mM 
NaCl, followed by a 0.05–1  M NaCl gradient over 10 
column volumes. As most of the recombinant MHETase 
eluted in the wash, the wash fraction was concentrated 
to a final volume of ~ 500  μL with an Ultra-15 10  kDa 
MWCO centrifugal concentrator (Amicon) and then 
loaded onto a Superdex 75 Increase 10/300 GL column 
(Cytiva). Recombinant MHETase was eluted in 20  mM 
Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 150  mM NaCl at 0.5  mL/min and 
peak fractions were pooled. Protein purity was assessed 
by SDS-PAGE (Additional file  1: Fig. S3) and protein 
concentration was measured spectrophotometrically 
using ε 280 = 102,330/M/cm. Protein aliquots were snap-
frozen prior to being stored at − 80 °C.
Recombinant MHETase activity was measured as 
described previously [32] in 100 mM sodium phosphate 
buffer (pH 7.5) at 24  °C. Enzymatic parameters were 
similar to published data for MHETase using MpNPT as 
substrate [9, 32]. To assess activity at different tempera -
tures, MHETase in 100 mM phosphate buffer pH 7.5 was 
pre-incubated in a water bath at the given temperature 
for 20 min before addition of the substrate and held at the 
same temperature after addition of MpNPT. The enzyme 
was freshly thawed before each assay. To determine activ-
ity over time, the recombinant enzyme was kept at room 
temperature in 100  mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 
7.5) for 4 days without shaking.
Purification, quantification, and activity measurement 
of MHETase secreted from yeast
Cultures of RLKY245 (intracellular MHETase control) 
and RLKY247 (OST1-MHETase-GFP) were grown 
overnight in SDall at 30  °C. The overnight culture was 
then induced by the addition of 10  μg/mL doxycycline 
as described above. After 4  h of induction, cells were 
centrifuged at 3500 rpm for 5 min at room temperature, 
and the supernatant was collected and kept on ice 
throughout the remainder of the procedure. The 
supernatant was concentrated to a final volume of 
~ 300 μL, and buffer exchanged to 100  mM sodium 
phosphate buffer pH 7.5 (Amicon Ultra-4, Millipore 
Sigma). The concentrated sample was stored at 4 °C for a 
maximum of one week.
MHETase concentration was measured by ELISA. 
Samples were diluted two-, four- and eightfold in 
sodium phosphate pH 7.5. Clear flat-bottom Immuno 
Nonsterile 96-well plates (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 
were coated with the samples, or with serial dilutions of 
purified GFP (Invitrogen; concentration range of 0.1–
50 ng/mL) at 4 °C overnight. The coating solution was 
then removed and 200 μL of blocking buffer (1×  PBS, 
3% non-fat milk, 0.1% Tween-20) was added to each 
well and incubated at room temperature for 1 h. After 
removal of the blocking solution 100  μL of anti-GFP 
(Living Colors GFP monoclonal antibody, Clontech) 
diluted 1:10,000 in antibody solution (1×  PBS, 1% non-
fat milk, 0.1% Tween-20) was added to each well and 
incubated at room temperature for 2  h. Plates were 
washed 3 times for 5  min each with PBS-T (1×  PBS, 
0.1% Tween 20). After removing the wash solution, 
50  μL of anti-mouse-HRP (Pierce) diluted 1:10,000 
in antibody solution was added to the plates, and 
incubated for 1  h at room temperature. Plates were 
then washed 3 times for 5  min each with PBS-T at 
room temperature. After removing the wash solution, 
100  μL of TMB substrate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) 
was added to each well. The reaction was incubated 
in the dark at room temperature for a maximum of 
10  min and stopped by adding 50  μL of 2  N HCl to 
each well. Absorbance was measured at 450  nm on a 
microplate reader (CLARIOstar, BMG LabTech) and 
measurements from RLKY245 supernatant were used 
as the negative control for the measurements of the 
RLKY247 supernatant. MHETase activity was assayed 
as described above for the recombinant MHETase 
purified from E. coli.
