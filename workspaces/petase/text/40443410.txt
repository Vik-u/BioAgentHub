ABSTRACT: The recent discovery of the PETase enzyme family
offers a sustainable solution for depolymerizing poly(ethylene
terephthalate) (PET), one of the most widespread plastic compounds,
under mild conditions. This enables the environmentally beneficial
conversion of plastic waste into value-added products. Among this
enzyme family, PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis has been the most
extensively studied. Although other similar enzymes have been
discovered, our knowledge about the catalytic and structural properties
of this class remains limited. In this study, a PETase-like enzyme
(PETase SM14) from Streptomyces sp. SM14 was heterologously
produced in Escherichia coli, and its activity was tested on post-
consumer plastic substrates using high-performance liquid chromatog-
raphy for product quantification as well as scanning electron
microscopy and atomic force microscopy for substrate surface imaging evaluation. PETase SM14 exhibited high salt tolerance
(1.5 M), good heat resistance (Tm 56.26 °C), and optimal activity at pH 9.0, highlighting its potential for PET waste
bioremediation. Furthermore, its X-ray crystal structure was solved at 1.43 Å resolution, revealing conserved features of the PETase
family with potential relevance for future engineering applications.

INTRODUCTION
Plastic materials, known for being cost-effective, versatile, and
durable, have seen rapid growth in global production, with 8.3
million tons produced between 1950 and 2015.
1,2
However,
inadequate recycling and limited circular reuse have resulted in
significant waste accumulation, raising serious environmental
concerns due to plastics’ resistance to natural degradation
processes.
3
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is widely used,
inherently stable, and environmentally persistent.
4
Although
PET is technically recyclable, only a small fraction is currently
processed through recycling efforts, while a majority of PET
waste persists in natural habitats. The global PET market is
projected to reach USD 109 billion by 2032, with a significant
annual growth rate (9.5%),
5
highlighting an urgent need for
sustainable management and recycling solutions, especially in
developing countries, where advanced recycling infrastructures
and regulatory frameworks are lacking.
6
While traditional PET
recycling methods such as thermo-mechanical and chemical
processes have been developed,
7
the efficiency remains limited,
and there is a pressing demand for alternative approaches. One
promising avenue lies in the discovery of microbial enzymes
capable of degrading PET. Recent studies have identified
enzymes�including members of the hydrolase family�
cutinases (EC 3.1.1.74), lipases (EC 3.1.1.3), and carboxyles-
terases (EC 3.1.1.1/EC 3.1.1.101/EC 3.1.1.2)�that exhibit
activity on low-crystallinity, low-density polymers of PET and
related compounds. These microbial enzymes show varied
structural adaptations that enhance their efficacy under distinct
conditions. Bacterial PET-degrading enzymes, such as IsPE-
Tase,
8
have been categorized into types I and II based on
structural characteristics; type II enzymes, in particular, feature
modifications like additional disulfide bonds and extended loops
near their active sites, enhancing substrate accessibility.
9
Despite
over 20 years of research on the enzymatic degradation of PET,
microbial enzymes still exhibit relatively low turnover rates,
reflecting the unique challenges presented by PET as a non-
natural substrate.

have been characterized, with 35 enzymes having their 3D
structures resolved.
11
This growing body of knowledge offers a
foundation for advancing enzyme-based approaches to PET
recycling, holding promise for more sustainable and efficient
plastic waste management solutions in the future. In recent
years, concerted efforts have been made to characterize each
aspect of these enzymes
12−15
and enhance their performance
through molecular engineering, which often resulted in the
creation of mutants featuring greater thermal stability and
increased catalytic properties.
16−19
Another emerging area of
interest involves the influence of specific salts on the properties
of these enzymes, particularly, their catalytic activity and
thermostability. For instance, Ca
2+
has been shown to alter the
tertiary structure of PETases, leading to increased activity and
thermal stability.
20,21
Similarly, K
+
and Na
+
ions may exert
effects analogous to Ca
2+
, as evidenced in a recent study.
22
Additionally, Schmidt et al.
23
demonstrated that the activity of
the polyester hydrolases LCC and TfCut2 on PET films strongly
depends on the type and concentration of the buffer. High initial
hydrolysis rates were observed using sodium phosphate buffer
concentrations exceeding 0.7 M, emphasizing the role of specific
salts in modulating enzyme performance.
In this work, we describe a candidate PETase-like enzyme,
SM14 (PETase SM14 hereafter), isolated from the marine-
sponge Streptomyces sp. SM14.
24
The enzyme was hetero-
logously expressed in Escherichia coli to characterize its
polyesterase activity. This was confirmed using a PET-based
post-consumer plastic (PCP) through liquid chromatography
assays (HPLC) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM)
analysis. Results revealed that the presence of NaCl was essential
for enzymatic catalysis, corroborating the enzyme’s halophilic
nature and superior salt tolerance compared to IsPETase, which
exhibits optimal activity at low salt concentrations. Further X-ray
crystallographic analysis of PETase SM14 revealed its three-
dimensional structure, which was compared to the well-
characterized IsPETase and with a polyester hydrolase (PE-H)
from Pseudomonas aestusnigri, another marine bacterium. All
three enzymes share conserved motifs, including the serine
hydrolase sequence Gly-x1-Ser-x2-Gly and the catalytic triad
Ser-Asp-His. These findings enhance our understanding of
PETase-like enzymes and their potential applications in PET
degradation.
■
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Production of PETase SM14. The protein was expressed in
E. coli BL21 (DE3) and purified as indicated in the Materials and
Methods section. The procedure led to the production of 162
mg of pure protein from 4.5 g of cellular pellet, resulting in a
yield of 3.6%. The identity of the protein was confirmed by
peptide-mass fingerprinting. Using the MASCOT search
database, the detected peptide sequences were compared
against all sequences stored in an in-house database as well as
the SwissProt database. This analysis revealed a match with the
mature form of PETase SM14. Notably, the sample achieved a
95% sequence coverage (Figure S1). Circular dichroism (CD)
data (Figure S2) confirm proper protein folding and align with
the structure determined by X-ray crystallography. The melting
temperature (Tm) of the enzyme was determined to be 56.26 °C
(Figure S2) by CD spectroscopy. To evaluate the enzyme’s
stability at varying pH values and NaCl concentrations, its
melting temperature (Tm) was determined using a thermal shift
assay across a pH range of 6.0−9.0 with NaCl concentrations
from 100 to 700 mM (Table S1). Changes in buffer pH had a
minimal impact on Tm, which remained relatively constant.
Increasing the salt concentration up to 700 mM in buffer Tris
pH 8.0 did not result in unfolding of the protein, as shown by the
non-decreasing Tm [°C]. This finding confirms the enzyme’s
stability at higher salt concentrations (Figure S3).
Structural Features. The X-ray structure of PETase SM14
(UniProt ID: A0A679PDB4) validated the accuracy of the
predicted AlphaFold structure, exhibiting a high structural
identity with a root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of 0.278 Å.
Notably, this extends to the loop regions, where the catalytic site
is located. IsPETase, a well-known enzyme active on PET,
15,25
has been extensively characterized.
14,26
In this study, IsPETase
and a polyester hydrolase (PE-H) identified in the genome of
the marine hydrocarbonoclastic bacterium P. aestusnigri
27
were
employed for comparative structural analysis of PETase SM14.
Structural alignment of the three enzymes shows a high degree
of similarity, with an RMSD of 0.691 Å across 190 Cα atoms for
IsPETase and an RMSD of 0.81 Å over 195 Cα atoms for PE-H
including the catalytic triad within the active site pocket (Figure
1). This indicates that these enzymes degrade PET through the
same catalytic mechanism. The serine-hydrolase mechanism
involves three conserved residues: serine, histidine, and

representations in the top right inset. The catalytic triad of PETase SM14 (blue sticks) comprises S156, D202, and H234, while that of IsPETase (green

aspartate, which retain their positions and orientation within the
structures of the two enzymes.
The electrostatic surface potentials of PETase SM14,
IsPETase, and PE-H are shown in Figure S4. IsPETase features
a highly polarized surface charge, resulting in an isoelectric point
(pI) of 9.41, whereas PETase SM14 and PE-H have a theoretical
pI of 6.67 and 6.54, respectively (as determined by the ExPASy,
ProtParam tool), and both exhibit a less polarized and more
delocalized surface charge. This variation in surface charges
seems to affect also the active site pocket; PETase SM14 and PE-
H show a slightly negative potential around the active site (red
regions in Figure S4A,B), in contrast with the more positively
charged pocket in IsPETase (Figure S4C).
The three structures primarily differ in five loop regions.
While the catalytic residues align across all three, the catalytic
pocket appears more closed in PE-H and SM14 compared to
that in IsPETase. In IsPETase, Y87 is positioned farther from the
catalytic residues, creating a more open catalytic pocket.
Additionally, in the PE-H enzyme, the P96-G97-F98-V99-S99-
A100-E101 sequence forms an elongated and flexible loop,
which may hinder substrate interaction with the catalytic
residues, potentially contributing to lower activity. The catalytic
site of IsPETase is surrounded by conserved hydrophobic
residues involved in substrate binding, including Y87, W159,
M161, W185, and I208
14
(Figure 2D). Structural alignment
enabled the identification of the corresponding residues of
PETase SM14 and PE-H, which have a nearly identical
arrangement: Y88, H155, M157, W181, I204 and F98, W170,
M172, W195, and I219 (Figure 2D). Hence, the catalytic site of
the three enzymes exhibits a similar spatial arrangement of the
aromatic and apolar residues involved in substrate binding,
although some differences are present. For instance, Y88 and
F98 in PETase SM14 and PE-H, respectively, are positioned in
such a way that the catalytic pocket appears to be more closed
(Figure 2A,B). In contrast, IsPETase Y87 is closer to M161,
creating a more open catalytic pocket (Figure 2C). A second
notable difference lies in the conserved serine-hydrolase motif
Gly-x1-Ser-x2-Gly motif. In IsPETase, this motif consists of
G158-W159-S160-M161-G162 located at the active site, typical
of other enzymes in the α/β hydrolase family.
26
In PETase
SM14, however, the motif includes a histidine (H155), instead
of a tryptophan (W159), which is commonly found in IsPETase
and related hydrolases,
14,25,26
also in PE-H (W170). Despite this
substitution, the overall spatial arrangement remains analogous
for both enzymes, preserving their functional capabilities.
Catalytic Activity. PETase SM14 successfully degraded
PCP samples, confirming the enzyme’s active form. Calibration
curves of the HPLC assay method for terephthalic acid (TPA)
and bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) were created by
using standard solutions. The relative standard deviation was
calculated for three repeated runs, resulting in a good linear
relationship with r
2
= 0.994 for TPA and r
2
= 0.982 for BHET
(Figure S5). These linear regression parameters were then
utilized to quantify all of the samples.
Temperature and pH Dependence. The pH dependence of
enzymatic activity was analyzed across a range of pH values from
6.0 to 9.0, without added salt. After 72 h of incubation, the
products were analyzed using reversed-phase high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC). The results (Figure 3) show
that the TPA production is strongly pH-dependent, with a 10-
fold increase in TPA production at pH 9.0 compared to pH 7.0
(≅0.02 mM TPA at pH 7.0 versus ≅0.2 mM at pH 9.0). The

highest concentration of released TPA was 0.187 mM at pH 9.0
and 40 °C (Figure 3), consistent with findings for IsPETase
produced in the chloroplasts of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii,
28
which released TPA at a concentration of 0.191 mM under the
same conditions (data not shown). The reactions conducted
without the enzyme or substrate yielded negligible amounts of
TPA in all measurements, confirming that PETase SM14 is
responsible for product formation. The pH values of the reaction
solutions remained unchanged throughout the entire reaction
time.
Two temperatures, 50 °C and 40 °C, were tested, yielding
very similar data. The optimal pH 9.0 is independent of the
temperature, as the TPA released at pH 9.0 is consistent at the
two temperatures (Figure 3). The glass transition temperature
(Tg) of PET, defined as the temperature at which the polymer
chain gain enhanced mobility, is approximately 80 °C. However,
during the enzymatic hydrolysis, the Tg value of PET decreases
to about 65 °C due to water molecules infiltrating the polymer
chains.
29
While IsPETase activity naturally decreases above 40
°C,
30
PETase SM14 maintained structural stability up to 50 °C
(Figure S2). The similar enzyme behavior at both temperatures
suggests that under these reaction conditions, temperature has
little effect on activity.
Within the residues of the canonical Ser-His-Asp triad,
aspartate is negatively charged, while histidine and serine are
partially ionized during catalysis. Notably, histidine must accept
a proton from serine, creating a catalytic environment with a
neutral or slightly basic optimal pH. However, the ideal pH
depends on the electrostatic environment and on the structure
of the active site in the presence of the substrate.
14,31,32
Variations of the pH of the medium result in changes in the ionic
state of the active site, impacting the reaction mechanism and,
consequently, TPA production.
33
For instance, histidine

collected at 50 °C, while the white bars describe the data at 40 °C. The

residues contain one or two nitrogen-bonded proton(s) in their
imidazole ring with a theoretical pKa of 6.5. However, studies
have determined pKa ranging from 4.7 (or even 4) to 7.5,
depending on the presence of positively charged residues within
the LCC esterase cavity.
34,35
Another study calculated a pKa ≈
10 due to the formation of a negatively charged complex.
34
Overall, achieving the best reaction conditions at basic pH
appears to be a common feature of serine esterases.
33,36
Furthermore, the hydrophilicity of PET is accelerated by the
partial alkaline hydrolysis reaction, which influences the
mechanism and the dissolution rate of the reaction products,
leading to the degradation of the PET outer surface.
37
NaCl Dependence. The effect of environmental conditions
on the PET-hydrolyzing activity of wild-type PETase SM14 was
evaluated under halophilic conditions by supplementing sodium
chloride in the reaction mixture (300−1500 mM). Figure 4
summarizes the results for all of the experiments conducted in
the presence of NaCl at pH 9.0. Additional measurements at salt
concentrations of 700 and 900 mM were performed at pH 5.0,
6.0, and 7.0; however, TPA release was negligible in all cases
(data not shown). These findings indicate that a significant
increase in enzyme activity due to salt concentration occurs only
at pH 9.0. The concentration of TPA released as a function of
salt addition is shown in Figure 4B. A notable increase in product
formation is observed in the presence of salt, exceeding a 100-
fold increase compared with the data obtained without salt
(TPA released: 0.2 mM). From the graph in Figure 4B, two key
transitions can be observed: the first one at the initial increase
from no salt to a 300 mM solution and the second one between
700 and 900 mM. Thereafter, stabilization occurs, with product
release remaining consistent at approximately 30 mM, even at
higher salt concentrations. The PCP used in these experiments is
PET-made of food packaging. The polymer matrix of this
material is less homogeneous than that of a pure PET film and
may exhibit regions of varied crystallinity. This contributes to
the slight variability of the results, as indicated by the error bars
representing the standard deviation in Figure 4B, even after four
replicate analyses under the same conditions. Nevertheless, 900
mM NaCl clearly emerges as the optimal concentration for this
enzyme. Morphological changes on the surfaces of PCP
fragments, as examined by SEM (Figure 4D−F) after incubation
with the enzyme, further confirm that 900 mM NaCl is the most
effective concentration for PET degradation. The results of
semi-contact atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging in air are
reported in Figure 4C, showing the effects of the protein on the
morphology of the PCP sample. In particular, the samples
incubated with the protein exhibit a dense network of holes on
their surfaces, whereas no such features are present on the
surface of the control sample (Figure S6). From AFM analysis,
two parameters related to enzyme activity can be extracted: the
average surface roughness of the samples σ
rms
and the lateral
correlation length ξ [Figure 5].
28,38,39
The average values of ξ
were obtained from four images of each sample. The variation in
ξ, which estimates the average dimensions of the holes on the
surface, can be ascribed solely to the activity of the enzyme as no
other sources of degradation were present during the
experimental procedure. In the control sample, ξ is related to
the microscopic structure of the polymeric film. PET film
samples showed a two-fold increase in ξ, from 200 ± 9 nm
(control sample) to 515 ± 44 nm (after enzyme incubation)
(Figure 5A). Also, σ
rms
significantly increased from 11 ± 6 nm in
the control sample to 98 ± 6 nm following the protein activity
(Figure 5B). Also in this case, the increase in σ
rms
correlates with
the presence of holes in the samples incubated with the enzyme.
AFM analysis further allowed for the calculation of the average
depth of the holes, which was determined to be approximately
340 ± 110 nm.
Several factors influence polymer biodegradation rates,
including crystallinity, chemical properties, and molecular
weight (MW). PET polymers have a crystallinity of 30−50%,
an average MW of 25,000, and are hydrophobic due to chain
packing,
40
even though PET’s backbone contains ester bonds
and polar functionalities such as carboxyl and hydroxyl groups
that provide polarity to the polymer. The numerous benzene
rings in the PET chain produce π−π interactions that enhance
dipole connections and encourage the polymer’s crystalline
organization by orienting the rings.
41
Positive and negative
dipoles also play an essential role in electrostatic interactions
between adjacent chains. The interaction between PETase and
the dipoles on the PET’s surfaces may be facilitated by a series of
cationic or anionic residues on the enzyme’s surface. These
residues are known to establish extensive Coulombic
interactions with the ligand’s polar groups. However, ion-pair
formation weakens at high salt concentrations due to increased
overall entropy, which may contribute to the enhanced catalytic
activity of PETase SM14 on PET despite these coulombic
interactions.
42
Furthermore, because it belongs to the marine
environment, this microbial hydrolase may exhibit enhanced
enzymatic activity in ocean-like conditions. This observation
aligns with studies suggesting that salt concentrations (0−1500
mM NaCl) increase PETase activity.
43
One possible explanation
involves the loops in the active site where substrate-interacting
residues are arranged. The high ionic force caused by dissolved
salts may induce structural changes in this region, altering the
spatial arrangement of the ester bond. This reorientation could

between PET samples incubated with PETase SM14 and those incubated in the control solution, i.e., in the absence of the enzyme (Figure S6).
Standard deviations, calculated from four images of each sample, are reported as errors bars.

bring the ester bond closer to the catalytic triad or change its
orientation, thereby promoting hydrolysis.

CONCLUSIONS
The accumulation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), a
highly resistant material with an annual production of 80 million
tons, poses significant threats to the environment and health.
Bioremediation with purified enzymes represents a promising
and environmentally acceptable solution for plastic waste
disposal. In this work, a new PETase was successfully produced
in E. coli and purified by IMAC chromatography. ESI-
ORBITRAP-MS for peptide-mass fingerprinting was performed
to confirm the correct amino acid sequence of the enzyme.
HPLC analysis of PET degradation products demonstrated the
presence of TPA, MHET, and BHET, which are established
markers of enzyme activity. PETase SM14 exhibited optimal
performance at pH 9.0 and showed thermostability up to 50 °C.
After 3 days of incubation, the highest concentration of released
TPA was 0.187 mM. Notably, the addition of 900 mM NaCl
enhanced enzyme activity by more than 100-fold, likely due to
conformational changes in the protein at pH 9.0 and its
interactions with the substrate. Additionally, the presence of salt
may weaken the substrate’s structure, further facilitating enzyme
activity.
41,42
The crystal structure of PETase SM14 was solved at
1.43 Å resolution, and a comparative analysis with IsPETase and
PE-H revealed high structural similarity, with RMSDs of 0.691
and 0.81 Å, respectively. Overall, our findings provide novel
valuable insight into a polyester hydrolase from a marine source.
Due to its thermostability and activity on PCP, PETase SM14
may represent an interesting tool for enzymatic PET waste
management.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
PETase SM14 Sequence Analysis. The target protein (PETase)
was identified in the PAZy database (https://www.pazy.eu/doku.php)
among the 119 sequences recognized as acting on PET. The protein
sequence spanning residues 25−284, classified by InterPro automatic
annotation as a cutinase, is provided in the Supporting Information
along with details of the expression vector (Figure S7).
Production of PETase SM14 in E. coli. The gene encoding the
mature PETase sequence from Streptomyces sp. SM14 (UniProt ID:
A0A679PDB4) was designed for Ligation Independent Cloning using
the aLICatorR system (ThermoFisher) and purchased from IDT. LIC
was used to generate the PETase-pLATE52 plasmid, which was then
used to transform BL21 (DE3) E. coli competent cells. Transformed
cells were selected on LB plates containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin.
Positive colonies were screened by colony-PCR and grown overnight at
37 °C with shaking at 250 rpm. For protein expression, a 1 L LB/
ampicillin culture was grown at 37 °C, 170 rpm, and induced with 0.5
mM isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h (Figure S8). Cells
were then harvested by centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 10 min),
resuspended in 50 mM phosphate buffer pH 8.0 (5 mL/g of biomass),
and sonicated on ice using a Microson Ultrasonic cell disruptor. The
supernatant was loaded on a HisTrap HP column and purified using the
following buffers: buffer A (50 mM phosphate buffer, pH 8.0) and
buffer B (50 mM phosphate buffer pH 8.0, 500 mM imidazole). The
column was washed with 2 column volumes of buffer A, and the protein
was eluted using a linear gradient of buffer B. Peak fractions (Figure S9)
were collected. Protein concentration was determined by measuring
A
280
and using an extinction coefficient (ε
280
) of 45,380 M
−1
cm
−1
and a
MW of 31,386 Da, as calculated using the ExPASy ProtParam Tool
(https://web.expasy.org/protparam/).
PETase SM14 Mass Spectrometry. MS/MS analyses were
performed using a UHPLC−MS Q Exactive instrument (Thermo-
Fisher). Protein samples were extracted from a single band on the
SDS−PAGE. The results were analyzed by MASCOT software (http://
mascot.cigs.unimo.it/mascot/) to identify the protein and verify its
sequence accuracy.
Circular Dichroism. CD spectra were recorded on a Jasco J-1500
spectrophotometer at 20 °C. CD spectroscopy was performed to
analyze the enzyme’s secondary structure and thermostability. Both
experiments were conducted on the enzyme after the His tag removal.
Spectra were averaged over three scans using a 2.0 mm quartz cuvette
with 2.5 μM samples in a 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 150 mM NaCl
buffer. Thermal denaturation curves were recorded in 2.0 mm cuvettes
sealed with Parafilm with 2.5 μM samples. Temperature-induced
denaturation was monitored at 222 nm, increasing at a rate of 1 °C/min
from 5 to 110 °C. Readings were taken at 1 °C intervals with a 1 nm
bandwidth and a 10 s response time. Thermal-denaturation midpoints
(Tm) were determined by fitting the data to a sigmoidal transition
curve using the Boltzmann function. The secondary structure of
different variants was measured at 200−250 nm wavelengths at 20 °C.
Ellipticity versus wavelength was plotted using GraphPad Prism 10
software, with each spectrum averaged over three scans.
Thermal Shift Assay. The melting temperature of each variant was
measured using differential scanning fluorimetry with Sypro-Orange
dye (ThermoFisher Scientific) on an Applied Biosystems 7500 Real-
Time PCR system (ThermoFisher Scientific). For each condition, 12.5
μL of enzyme at the starting concentration of 10 μM was added to 12.5
μL of a 10× Sypro-Orange dye solution diluted from a 5000× stock in
the same buffer that was used for the protein to reach the final volume of
25 μL, a 5× final concentration of the dye and a 5 μM concentration of
the enzyme. All the Tm measurements were performed in 3 replicates
(Figures S10−S12). Fluorescence was monitored during the thermal
denaturation occurring to the protein upon increasing the temperature
from 15 °C to 95.3 °C.
Crystals of PETase SM14. Crystals of the enzyme without the His-
tag were grown at room temperature by using the vapor diffusion
method. A 1 μL aliquot of a 10 mg/mL protein sample was mixed with 1
μL of a solution containing 0.2 M ammonium sulfate, 0.1 M MES
monohydrate pH 6.5, and 30% w/v polyethylene glycol monomethyl
ether 5000. Crystals, which appeared within 1−2 weeks, were frozen in
a chemically identical solution supplemented with 25% (v/v) glycerol
prior to X-ray diffraction data collection.
Data Collection and Processing. Diffraction data were obtained
using a Eiger2 XE 16M detector and a radiation of wavelength of
0.71326 Å on the I03 beamline at the Diamond Light Source
(Oxfordshire, United Kingdom). Data processing was performed using
the AutoPROC package. Data collection and refinement statistics are
summarized in Table S2.
Structure Determination and Refinement. For PETase SM14
structure determination, initial data was obtained through molecular
replacement using Phaser, with the atomic coordinates of the
AlphaFold model (AF-A0A679PDB4-F1) serving as the starting
model. Refinement was performed through iterative rounds of manual
adjustments in Coot and automated refinement using REFMAC5.
Water molecules were added manually and automatically using the
refine tool in Coot from the CCP4 cloud package.
PETase SM14 Activity Assays. The enzymatic activity of PETase
SM14 was evaluated using PET PCP, while varying parameters such as
temperature and pH. Reaction tubes were set up by adding a squared
piece of PCP (A = 1 cm
2
) into 400 μL buffer containing 1 μM protein
solution. The degrading activity of the enzyme toward post-consumer
plastic was tested at different pH values; 100 mM phosphate buffer was
used to run tests at pH 6.0 and 7.0, while 100 mM Tris−HCl was used
for tests at pH 8.0 and 9.0. The range of NaCl concentration was 0 mM,
300 mM, 500 mM, 700 mM, 900 mM, 1000 mM, 1100 mM, 1300 mM,
and 1500 mM. After an incubation time of 72 or 168 h, the reaction
tubes containing the PCP were vigorously mixed using a Vortex mixer,
and then the substrate was removed with tweezers, washed with SDS
1%, then rinsed with ddH
2
O and finally with 98% ethanol, while the
supernatant was filtered and further analyzed by RP-HPLC. For every
set of reactions, two control samples were prepared following the same
procedure: one was prepared without adding the protein to the reaction
mixture, while the other was prepared without adding the substrate.

RP-HPLC Analyses. The reaction supernatants were dried using a
Thermo ScientificTM SavantTM DNA SpeedVacTM Concentrator
Kit and resuspended in H
2
O/acetonitrile. Solution A consists of 10%
formic acid Milli-Q water, while solution B is acetonitrile. An Agilent
Poroshell 120 EC-C18 column was equilibrated with a mobile phase of
80:20 (solution A/solution B) until pressure and UV parameters
reached stability. Then, 20 μL of each sample was loaded into the
column and eluted over a 20 min run at a flow rate of 1 mL/min at room
temperature with the following elution program: 80:20 (solution A/
solution B), followed by a 15 min linear gradient 20:50 (solution A/
solution B), and 2 min isocratic 50:50 (solution A/solution B). Then, to
return to the starting point, 3 min linear gradient from 50:20 (solution
A/solution B) and 2 min isocratic 80:20 (solution A/solution B) were
applied. The absorbance was measured at 240 and 254 nm. To
determine peak areas, the baseline was drawn manually and calculated
using the instrument’s software. TPA and BHET were the two main
products obtained. Their calibration curves were generated by injecting
standard solutions at concentrations of 0.5 2.5 mM, 10 mM, 20 mM,
and 30 mM for TPA and 0.05, 0.1, 0.25, and 0.4 mM for BHET.
According to Figure S13, the reaction product with the highest
retention time was BHET (2.6 min), followed by MHET (2.2 min,
assumed) and TPA (1.6 min).
Scanning Electron Microscopy Imaging. The morphology of
PCP films before and after enzyme exposure was examined by SEM on a
FEI Nova NanoSEM at an accelerating voltage of 10 kV. Samples were
metallized in a Gold Sputter Coater Emitech K550 for 60 s at 18 mA.
Digitized images were brought into Epax genesis software for assembly.
Atomic Force Microscopy. Protein activity was also assessed by
analyzing the plastic pieces after incubation with the enzyme by AFM.
Morphological characterization of PET samples was performed using
an NT-MDT SMENA Solver platform (Moscow, Russia); the analysis
was performed in semi-contact mode, and the images were analyzed
using Gwyddion 2.67 freeware (http://gwyddion.net).
