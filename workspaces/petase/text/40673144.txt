The pervasive accumulation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) waste has
emerged as a critical ecological crisis, which is mainly driven by its recalcitrance
to natural degradation and widespread contamination of terrestrial and
aquatic ecosystems. In response to this challenge, microbial-mediated PET
biodegradation has garnered signiﬁcant scientiﬁc attentions as a sustainable
remediation strategy, harnessing the enzymatic cascades of specialized
microorganisms to depolymerize PET into bio-assimilable monomers such as
terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG). In this review, we summarize
the extracellular process of PET biodegradation, including microbial attachment,
colonization, and direct depolymerization, as well as the metabolic pathways
of PET monomers. Strategies for developing PET-degrading chassis cells are
also discussed, such as cell surface display, metabolic pathway optimization,
and rational design of enzyme-PET interfaces. Microbial-enzyme consortia and
molecular engineering of photosynthetic microorganisms also contribute to PET
degradation. Although signiﬁcant progress has been made, challenges remain in
enzyme stability, metabolic bottlenecks, industrial scalability, and environmental
adaptation. Overall, microbial and enzymatic strategies show great potentials
in addressing PET pollution, and future interdisciplinary efforts are needed to
overcome these challenges and achieve a sustainable circular plastic economy.

1 Introduction
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), renowned for its excellent physical and chemical
properties, is one of the most extensively used synthetic polymers globally. Owing to
its remarkable durability, versatility, and cost-eﬀectiveness, PET has found extensive
application across a diverse range of industries, including packaging, textiles, and
electronics. However, the widespread use of PET has also led to a signiﬁcant accumulation
of plastic waste in the environment (MacLeod et al., 2021; Santos et al., 2021). PET is highly
resistant to natural degradation processes, with a long half-life that can span hundreds
of years in landﬁlls, oceans, and other ecosystems (Chu et al., 2022; Zhu et al., 2024).

This has given rise to severe environmental concerns, including
soil and water pollution, harm to wildlife, and negative impacts on
human health (Preda et al., 2024; Li Y. et al., 2024).
Current PET recycling strategies include mechanical recycling
and energy-intensive chemical methods (e.g., glycolysis and
hydrolysis) (Cao et al., 2022; Mahler et al., 2025; Ragaert
et al., 2017), which usually require high temperatures ( >200◦C)
and generate toxic byproducts. While thermal incineration
would recover energy, it might emit CO 2 and other hazardous
pollutants. These approaches would also struggle with scalability,
cost, and environmental trade-oﬀs. Additionally, biological PET-
degradation, especially the microbial-mediated biodegradation, has
emerged as a promising and sustainable solution to address this
ecological crisis (Figure 1; Mudondo et al., 2023; Bian et al., 2024).
Certain microorganisms could employ endogenous enzymatic
cascades to depolymerize PET into monomers (Yip et al., 2024;
Yoshida et al., 2021; Barone et al., 2024), which oﬀers a sustainable
pathway to mitigate PET pollution. Therefore, understanding
the metabolic pathways involved in PET biodegradation is
fundamental for harnessing the full potentials of the PET-degrading
microorganisms. However, the eﬃciency of native microbial
systems usually remains constrained, such as by suboptimal
enzyme activity, substrate accessibility, and inhibitory byproduct
accumulation. To address these limitations, enzyme molecular
engineering has emerged as a promising approach to enhance PET
depolymerization by optimizing the catalytic eﬃciency of these
enzymes (Arnal et al., 2023; Liu F. et al., 2023). Furthermore, the
use of synthetic biology and metabolic engineering has further
facilitated these processes, leading to signiﬁcant advancements
in PET biodegradation (Bian et al., 2024; Diao et al., 2023).
Examples include directed evolution (Shi et al., 2023), dual-enzyme
systems (Aer et al., 2024b), surface-display technologies (Xue et al.,
2024), and microbial consortia (Salinas et al., 2025), which have
demonstrated signiﬁcant potential in overcoming critical barriers
such as intermediate metabolite accumulation and hydrophobic
substrate interactions.
Cell factories, the engineered microorganisms with optimized
metabolic capabilities, play a crucial role in multiple key aspects
(Cho et al., 2022; Qiu et al., 2023; Hussain et al., 2022; Zuo
et al., 2024), such as the realm of biotechnology and industrial
production, the pharmaceutical industry, the ﬁeld of environmental
remediation, the production of ﬁne chemicals and industrial
enzymes. Through metabolic engineering and synthetic biology
approaches, the genetic makeup of chassis cells could be modiﬁed
and optimized, which ensures that the cellular metabolic pathways
(metabolic ﬂux) are ﬁnely tuned. Equipped with optimal PET
hydrolases and optimized metabolic pathways, the engineered
cell factories would demonstrate enhanced degradation rates and
sustainable utilization of the degradation products (Moog et al.,
2021; Dissanayake and Jayakody, 2021; Valenzuela-Ortega et al.,
2023; Schneier et al., 2024). Especially, once PET is broken down,
the resulting monomers and other small-molecule products would
be channeled into the well-designed biosynthetic pathways within
the cells (Mubayi et al., 2024; Y ang et al., 2024). For instance,
the monomers can be used as building blocks for the synthesis of
other high-value chemicals (Diao et al., 2024; You et al., 2023),
such as specialty solvents, pharmaceutical precursors, or bio-
based polymers. This not only reduces the reliance on fossil-based
feedstocks but also minimizes the environmental impact associated
with conventional plastic production processes. The circular plastic
economy seeks to eradicate waste generation through perpetual
material recycling into novel products, achieved by implementing
innovative strategies for designing eﬃcient metabolic pathways to
facilitate monomer conversion. The closed-loop system created by
these biological systems ensures that materials are recycled and
reused, reducing waste generation and promoting environmental
sustainability (Rani et al., 2024; Arijeniwa et al., 2024).
This review analyzes the current state-of-the-art in microbial-
mediated PET biodegradation. It is mainly focused on the key
enzymes and the metabolic pathways involved in PET degradation,
and the strategies for engineering cell factories with enhanced
PET degradation eﬃciency. Additionally, it also explores the
upcycling of PET degradation products into valuable chemicals
to oﬀer a sustainable approach for plastic waste management.
By presenting a detailed overview of these aspects, we hope to
provide valuable insights for researchers in this ﬁeld, and facilitate
the development of more eﬀective and environmentally friendly
solutions for PET biodegradation.
2 Microbial-mediated degradation
of polyethylene terephthalate
2.1 The extracellular process of PET
bio-degradation
The process of microbial-mediated degradation of plastic
polymers usually encompasses several key steps (Jaiswal et al.,
2019), including biodeterioration, bio-fragmentation, assimilation,
and mineralization. To achieve optimal microbial utilization
for PET biodegradation, a systematic elucidation of metabolic
mechanisms must integrate genomic engineering, enzymatic
optimization, and ecological synergy. This will guide strategies to
engineer microbial platforms with dual catalytic and PET upcycling
capabilities, which paves the way for innovative plastic-to-value
conversion systems.
2.1.1 The process of microbial attachment and
colonization
During the process of microbial-mediated PET biodegradation,
microorganisms must ﬁrstly be able to adhere to and proliferate on
the surface of PET plastic, which is achieved through a combination
of biological and physicochemical mechanisms. For example,
speciﬁc species within the genus Bacillus and Pseudomonas exhibit
an aﬃnity for polymers like PET. Moreover, they usually possess
the ability to form bioﬁlms on the surfaces of PET materials, which
would allow them to persist and colonize surfaces (Skariyachan
et al., 2017; Sivan et al., 2006). This is a crucial step in
the biodegradation process. In Bacillus species, the formation
of bioﬁlms is usually regulated by the two-component signal
transduction systems (TCSs) (Ducret et al., 2022), which are
typically composed of a sensor histidine kinase (HK) and a response
regulator (RR).
Furthermore, it was found that several factors are capable
of regulating the surface-attachment process, which can
inﬂuence how microorganisms or the enzymes interact with

surfaces. The hydrophobins (HPs), a kind of small secreted
surface-active proteins, could also mediate fungal attachment to
hydrophobic surfaces like PET (Terauchi et al., 2022; Sánchez,
2020). In light of this, HPs may serve as eﬀective substrates to
enhance microbial adhesion, particularly for strains expressing
surface-displayed PET-degrading enzymes, thus signiﬁcantly
improving enzymatic degradation eﬃciency. Moreover, the
implementation of chimeric anchor motifs (e.g., Bacillus subtilis-
derived LCI modules) also enables precision immobilization
of enzymatic machineries on PET matrices through aﬃnity-
driven molecular recognition (Liu Y. et al., 2024). This would
establish a bioengineered interface that ampliﬁes substrate-enzyme
dynamics and potentiates depolymerization within catalytic
microenvironments. Additionally, exopolysaccharides also play
roles in the attachment, bioﬁlm adhesion and biodeterioration
of plastic polymers (A et al., 2020). Manipulating the levels of
the second messenger molecule (cyclic-di-GMP), which regulates
bioﬁlm formation, has been demonstrated to signiﬁcantly enhance
the plastic degradation rates (Howard and McCarthy, 2023). The
introduction of diguanylate cyclases (DGCs) into Escherichia coli
strains expressing PET-degrading enzymes resulted in a notable
increase in polyester degradation, which highlights that adjusting
bioﬁlm levels can boost enzyme eﬃcacy.
2.1.2 The process of direct PET-depolymerization
After adhering to the surface and establishing colonization,
microorganisms are likely to actively secrete extracellular PET-
degrading enzymes speciﬁcally bound to PET surfaces, thereby
facilitating the biodegradation process. In this stage, two diﬀerent
catalysts would be produced (Table 1) (Kawai et al., 2019):
the surface modiﬁcation enzymes (associated with enzymatic
modiﬁcation of PET to increase the surface hydrophilicity)
and the PET-degrading enzymes (capable of directly breaking
the ester bonds within the PET polymer releasing monomeric
products). PET hydrolases and surface modiﬁcation enzymes
play distinct roles in PET biodegradation. PET hydrolases (e.g.,
IsPETase) directly cleave ester bonds in PET, depolymerizing it
into soluble monomers like terephthalic acid (TPA), ethylene
glycol (EG), mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET), and
Bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET). These enzymes usually
exhibit catalytic triads (e.g., S160-D206-H237 in IsPETase) and
structural adaptations (e.g., disulﬁde bridges) for substrate binding
and hydrolysis. In contrast, surface modiﬁcation enzymes (e.g.,
lipases and carboxylesterases) enhance PET hydrophilicity by
weakening intermolecular forces, reducing mechanical strength,
and increasing water aﬃnity. While hydrolases target chemical
bonds, surface modiﬁers precondition the polymer physically,
enabling eﬃcient depolymerization by hydrolases. Lipases,
carboxylesterases, and most cutinases exhibit surface modiﬁcation
capabilities that reduce PET strength by weakening intermolecular
forces. This would compromise mechanical properties while
accelerating degradation susceptibility. For example, lipase from
Aspergillus oryzae was used as a catalyst for enzymatic modiﬁcation
of PET fabric combined with polyethylene glycol (PEG), which
showed that the water contact angle (WCA) of the treated fabric
was signiﬁcantly reduced from 129.3 ◦to 74.9◦, while the moisture

regain increased to 3.52% (Liu W. et al., 2024). The lipase from
Thermomyces lanuginosus was also successfully used for the
biodegradation of PET fabrics/ﬁlms combined with cutinases from
Thermobiﬁda fusca and Fusarium solani (Eberl et al., 2009). In
addition to surface-modiﬁcation, the lipase B from Moesziomyces
antarcticus (CALB) was also found to be capable of eﬃciently
converting BHET to MHET and subsequently MHET to TPA and
EG (Carniel et al., 2017).
On the contrary, a limited number of cutinases and the PETase
have been recognized as the PET-degrading enzymes (or named
as PET hydrolases), which are capable of breaking down PET
directly into smaller, water-soluble molecules. The cutinase, such
as T. fusca cutinase (TfCut2) (Mrigwani et al., 2023), F. solani
pisi cutinase (FsC) (Hellesnes et al., 2023), leaf-branch compost
cutinase (LCC) (Sulaiman et al., 2012) or their mutants (Tournier
et al., 2020; Hong et al., 2023), have all been successfully applied
for PET hydrolysis. For instance, the thermostable variant of LCC
(LCCICCG) demonstrated exceptional catalytic eﬃciency, and it
was able to degrade 90% of the pretreated PET bottles within
10 h (Tournier et al., 2020). In addition, the recently identiﬁed
mesophilic IsPETase and MHETase from Ideonella sakaiensis 201-
F6 have drawn great attentions (Yoshida et al., 2016), which could
catalyze the biodegradation of low-crystallinity (1.9%) PET ﬁlm at
room temperature (30◦C). Though IsPETase displays a lower PET-
degrading activity than cutinase or cutinase-like PET-degrading
enzymes, it provides a more environmentally friendly and energy-
saving alternative for PET recycling. On this basis, various PETase
mutants have been developed with better catalytic performance,
and increased thermostability such as HotPETase (Bell et al., 2022),
DuraPETase (Cui et al., 2021), Fast-PETase (Lu et al., 2022), TS-
PETase (Zhong-Johnson et al., 2021), ThermoPETase (Francis et al.,
2019) and the fused protein with the carbohydrate-binding module

(CBM) (Dai et al., 2021; Wang T. et al., 2024) or hydrophobin
(HFBI) (Chen et al., 2022).
It is important to highlight that the intermediates and ﬁnal
products of PET degradation (e.g., BHET and MHET) have been
identiﬁed as competitive inhibitors of PET hydrolases (Barth
et al., 2015a). Especially, during the hydrolysis of PET, MHET
tends to accumulate to a greater extent than BHET, moreover
MHET exhibits a strong aﬃnity for the catalytic site of PET
hydrolases (Barth et al., 2015b). Therefore, the accumulation of
MHET would signiﬁcantly impede the eﬃciency of enzymatic
PET depolymerization. Consequently, the ongoing removal of
soluble metabolites of PET-degradation is essential for overcoming
competitive inhibition (Kushwaha et al., 2022).
Thermostable cutinases like LCC ICCG exhibit exceptional
thermostability and display improved catalytic eﬃciency on semi-
crystalline PET, which made them ideal for the industrial-scale
processes requiring high-temperature pretreatment. In contrast,
mesophilic PETase (e.g., IsPETase) are found to be capable of being
operated at ambient temperatures (30 ◦C) but suﬀered from low
activity and poor stability, which might limit its industrial viability.
However, its energy-saving potential makes it environmentally
advantageous for in situ remediation (Mrigwani et al., 2023).
Advanced PETase mutants (e.g., DuraPETase and Fast-PETase)
now enable gap closure through optimized mesophilic functionality
(35◦C) coupled with 4.2-fold increased degradation rates compared
to wild-type enzymes.
2.2 Microbial-mediated biodegradation
pathway of PET
The extracellular enzymatic hydrolysis of PET begins with the
cleavage of ester bonds through enzymatic action, yielding aromatic
intermediates such as TPA, BHET, MHET, and EG. This initial
depolymerization phase constitutes the kinetic bottleneck in PET
decomposition. The released depolymerization products (primarily
TPA and EG) undergo sequential internalization and catabolism
through microbial peripheral metabolic pathways (Kushwaha et al.,
2022; Gao et al., 2022; Qi et al., 2021b). This process drives cellular
proliferation by redirecting carbon ﬂux within metabolic networks,
ultimately sustaining biomass synthesis through optimized carbon
allocation strategies. Ultimately, biodegradation achieves complete
mineralization through coordinated metabolic pathways. In this
process, organic substrates are fully oxidized into inorganic end-
products (CO2 and H2O) via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle and
associated intracellular redox mechanisms. This process could be
illustrated by Figure 2 (Kushwaha et al., 2022; Gao et al., 2022; Qi
et al., 2021b).
2.2.1 The metabolic pathways of TPA
Terephthalic acid is taken up by microorganisms through
speciﬁc transporters such as the MucK in Acinetobacter baylyi
ADP1 (Pardo et al., 2020). Once inside the cell, TPA would
be catabolized via the protocatechuate (PCA) 4,5-cleavage
pathway (Sasoh et al., 2006; Fukuhara et al., 2008). In this
process, genes responsible for TPA degradation are situated
within two nearly identical clusters: tphRICIA2IA3IBIA1I and
tphRIICIIA2IIA3IIBIIA1II. The genes ( tphR, tphC, tphA2, tphA3,
tphB, and tphA1) are anticipated to encode for the IclR-type
transcriptional regulator, the TPA binding receptor, the large
subunit of the oxygenase component of TPA 1,2-dioxygenase
(TPADO), the small subunit of the oxygenase component
of TPADO, a 1,2-dihydroxy-3,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-dicarboxylate
dehydrogenase (DCDDH), and a reductase component of TPADO,
respectively. The TPADO is capable of converting TPA into
1,2-dihydroxy-3,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-dicarboxylate, which would
be further converted into protocatechuic acid (PCA) catalyzed
by DCDDH. The PCA is then ring-cleaved by PCA 3,4-
dioxygenase (P34Os) (Guzik et al., 2014), and the resulting
products are further metabolized into acetyl-CoA entering the
TCA cycle for further oxidation and energy production. Some
microorganisms (e.g., Blastobotrys (Arxula) adeninivorans ) is
capable of decarboxylating PCA by the gallic acid decarboxylase
(Agdc1p) (Meier et al., 2017). The catechol-1,2-dioxygenase
(Acdo1p) in Blastobotrys raﬃnosifermentans is determined to be
associated with the catabolism of PCA (Meier et al., 2022). It
was also found that overexpression of catechol-1,2-dioxygenase
(ACDO1) in B. raﬃnosifermentans resulted in a faster conversion
of catechol to cis,cis-muconic acid, which revealed that ACDO1
is probably associated with the PCA degradation. Furthermore,
aromatic compounds such as PCA are primarily metabolized
through the β-ketoadipate pathway in microorganisms. This
pathway facilitates the sequential conversion of PCA into acetyl-
CoA and succinyl-CoA, which serve as key intermediates for
integration into the TCA cycle to drive energy production and
biosynthetic processes. Representative microbial species capable
of executing this metabolic route include Rhodococcus opacus
PD630 (Navas et al., 2021) and Aspergillus niger (Sgro et al.,
2023), both of which exhibit robust aromatic degradation capacities
with potential applications in bioremediation and bio-industrial
synthesis. Specially, in Rhodococcus jostii RHA1, a second
degradation pathway for PCA was identiﬁed, which leads to the
formation of hydroxyquinol (benzene-1,2,4-triol) (Spence et al.,
2020). The gene cluster (ro01857-ro01860) is crucial for the
degradation of PCA and it is predominantly composed of genes
that encode for hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenase and maleylacetate
reductase. The former catalyzes the ring-cleavage of hydroxyquinol
to produce maleylacetate, while maleylacetate reductase further
converts maleylacetate into 3-oxoadipate. Additionally, in this
cluster another two genes are hypothesized to encode a mono-
oxygenase (ro01860) and a decarboxylase (ro01859).
2.2.2 The metabolic pathways of EG
For EG, it could be directly metabolized into the Krebs cycle by
certain microorganisms such as Pseudomonas putida via isocitrate
(Li et al., 2019; Hosseinpour et al., 2016). InP. putida, this is a multi-
step process, including the following critical steps: initial oxidation
step, conversion to glycolic acid, generation of glyoxylic acid,
and ﬁnally entry into the Krebs cycle. The alcohol dehydrogenase
(ADH) plays a crucial role in the oxidation of EG, which is
capable of oxidizing EG to glycolaldehyde (GA), a more reactive
aldehyde intermediate. Then, GA will be catalyzed into glycolic acid
catalyzed by the aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Subsequently,
glycolic acid is converted to glyoxylic acid, a precursor for entry
into the Krebs cycle, which is catalyzed by glycolate oxidase (GOX).
Finally, the glyoxylic acid enters the Krebs cycle through the
glyoxylate shunt, and this process is mainly facilitated by isocitrate

lyase and malate synthase. Isocitrate lyase is capable of cleaving
isocitrate (a Krebs cycle intermediate) to form glyoxylate and
succinate, and the malate synthase then combines glyoxylate with
acetyl-CoA to generate malate. This enzymatic process allows EG to
be incorporated into the central metabolic pathway, where it would
be further oxidized and utilized to generate energy in the form of
ATP and reducing equivalents (e.g., NADH and FADH2).
Escherichia coli also has the capability of metabolizing EG
(Shimizu and Inui, 2024). In E. coli, EG is ﬁrstly oxidized to GA
catalyzed by propanediol oxidoreductase encoded by the fuco gene.

Liu et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2025.1599470
Then, GA is further oxidized to glycolic acid by glycolaldehyde
dehydrogenase with NAD and NADP as coenzymes. Subsequently,
the glycolic acid would be metabolized via the glycolate pathway
generating the ﬁnal product glyoxylic acid, which mainly catalyzed
by the glycolate oxidase. Finally, the glyoxylic acid will enter the
Krebs cycle through the glyoxylate shunt similar to that found in
the P. putida.
3 Strategies for the development of
promising chassis cells for
PET-degradation
3.1 Cell surface display utilized for
PET-biodegradation
Cell surface display technology is a robust genetic engineering
approach that facilitates the targeted anchoring of functional
proteins or peptides onto microbial cell membranes through
genetic engineering approaches, with applications spanning both
prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms. Its versatility stems from the
ability to maintain the structural integrity and biological activity
of displayed biomolecules while enabling direct interaction with
extracellular environments, which makes it particularly valuable for
applications ranging from whole-cell biocatalysis to environmental
bioremediation and biomedical engineering. Consequently, this
section highlights the strategic integration of cell surface display
systems in engineering microbial catalysts for enhanced PET
biodegradation, establishing this approach as a versatile platform
bridging fundamental research and industrial applications.
3.1.1 Application of the surface-displayed PETase
in E. coli
Heyde et al. (2021) proposed an eﬃcient screening method
for identifying enzymes that act on PET with surface display
technology utilized in E. coli (Figure 3). Performance of two
diﬀerent membrane anchors were investigated for displaying
IsPETase: C-IgAP from Neisseria gonorrhoeae and an Lpp-
OmpA fusion protein from E. coli . Results indicated that
Lpp-OmpA was more eﬀective for displaying IsPETase, which
displayed a PET-degrading activity comparable to 20 nM free
IsPETaseAustin. Furthermore, the fused GFP-nanobody, acting as
a surrogate marker for assessing enzyme activity on the cell
surface, signiﬁcantly improves the eﬃciency of high-throughput
screening strategies for identifying PET-degrading enzyme. In
a separate investigation, researchers engineered E. coli to co-
display HotPETase and a β-glucan-speciﬁc carbohydrate-binding
module ( BaCBM) through a truncated outer membrane hybrid
protein (FadL) anchoring system, which creates regenerable whole-
cell biocatalysts with enhanced operational stability for PET
biodegradation (Wang T. et al., 2024). This system showed
enhanced PET-degradation eﬃciency, reusability and stability,
which could produce 1.03 mM of water-soluble products, retain
activity after ∼100 h at 40 ◦C, and maintain ∼54.6% of its initial
activity after nine cycles.
To achieve the purpose of eﬃcient display of PETase,
identiﬁcation and design of powerful anchoring motifs is highly
important. To date, several passenger proteins have been shown
to be suitable for surface display of target protein. For example,
PgsA, from B. subtilis, was shown to be capable of presenting active
PETase on the cell surface of E. coli (Y amashita et al., 2024). YeeJ, a
new inverse autotransporter in E. coli , has also been successfully
utilized for surface display of PETase in E. coli UT5600 (Gercke
et al., 2021). Moreover, it was found that the cell-displayed PETase
in combination with externally supplied rhamnolipids displayed
improved PET-degrading performance (increased by ∼16-fold)
compared with the free PETase. Notably, the system demonstrated
eﬃcient degradation of highly crystalline post-consumer PET
bottles (initial crystallinity: 34.4%), which results in a remarkable
reduction to 8% residual crystallinity within 3 days under mild
conditions (25 ◦C). The whole-cell biocatalyst system featuring
surface co-display of high-aﬃnity adhesive proteins (cp52k from
the stalked barnacle Pollicipes pollicipes and mfp-3) and Fast-
PETase has been successfully constructed in E. coli to enhance PET
biodegradation eﬃciency (Hu and Chen, 2023). The ice nucleation
protein (INP), a structurally characterized outer membrane
protein derived from Pseudomonas syringae , has also been
extensively employed as an anchoring scaﬀold to enable eﬀective
surface display of fused functional proteins (Ramezani Khorsand
et al., 2024). This application leverages its modular architecture
comprising N-terminal membrane-anchoring domains, repetitive
central β-helical motifs for water interaction, and C-terminal
aggregation interfaces.
Curli, composed of self-assembling CsgA monomers, is capable
of forming β-sheeted nanoﬁbers covering the bacteria, which might
be also utilized to facilitate the secretion and display of catalytic
enzymes (Sleutel et al., 2023; Zhang X. et al., 2023). Recently, a
proposal has been put forward to engineer the curli of E. coli
by fusing CsgA with IsPETase for PET degradation (Zhu et al.,
2022). The fused CsgA-PETase was capable of forming functional
PETase-coated curli nanoﬁbers on the surface of E. coli PHL628,
which resulted in the formation of whole-cell biocatalyst (BIND-
PETase, Figure 4A). BIND-PETase exhibited an impressive activity
of 966 ±29 U/g and demonstrated remarkable stability even
after 30 days at both 4 ◦C and room temperature. However, it is
worth noting that its activity dropped to 55% after only three
cycles. BIND-PETase could eﬀectively degrade PET microplastics
in wastewater and depolymerize post-consumer PET releasing
TPA and MHET (total of 4.3 mM after 15 days, and 3.3 mM
after 7 days, respectively). Especially, the degrading performance
could be further improved by 22.1% with addition of 0.02% STS.
Similarly, fusing CsgA and PETases to E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN)
resulted in a 10-fold increase in PET-degrading activity (Wang
C. et al., 2024) compared to that from Zhu et al. (2022). Among
the obtained whole-cell catalysts, EC-FastPETase shows the highest
activity in PET ﬁlm degradation [3.0 ±0.073 mg/(d ×cm2)] with
a total product of 11.4 ±0.3 nM. Especially, co-display of CBM3
and EC-FastPETase signiﬁcantly promoted bioﬁlm formation and
cell adsorption resulting a 35% increase in degrading activity
(3.4 ±0.148 mg/(d ×cm2), yield 1.5 ±0.1 mM). This reaction
system was also capable of eﬀectively degrading PET ﬁlm and
microplastics, releasing 12.7 ±0.2 mM TPA and 1.65 ±0.05 mM
MHET. In addition, it could catalyze the transformation of 10
and 100 µm PET microplastics into TPA (11.14 ±0.12 and
8.38 ±0.1 mM), with degradation eﬃciencies of 21.40% and
16.09%, respectively. The improved catalytic eﬃciency could

be partially attributed to the enhanced secretory capacity of
extracellular proteins. More signiﬁcantly, the strategic intracellular
co-expression of MHETase coupled with surface-displayed CBM3
synergistically enhanced both substrate accessibility and metabolic
processing of PET polymers (Figure 4B). This integrated enzymatic
conﬁguration demonstrated remarkable catalytic enhancement,
achieving a 10- to 20-fold greater degradation eﬃciency for BHET
compared to the conventional free enzyme systems.
3.1.2 Application of the surface-displayed PETase
in yeast cells
A state-of-the-art yeast surface display system with ultra-high-
throughput capabilities has recently been engineered to streamline
the discovery and functional characterization of PET-hydrolyzing
enzymes (Cribari et al., 2023). The system demonstrates exceptional
eﬃciency in enzyme evaluation through simultaneous display
of multiple enzyme variants on yeast cell surfaces, allowing
quantitative assessment of binding interactions and catalytic
performance without requiring protein puriﬁcation. It involves
three critical steps: design of a PET-mimicking probe for yeast
surface display, utilization of ﬂuorescent streptavidin to label
unhydrolyzed probes, and use of the ﬂuorescence activated cell
sorting (FACS) to identify and obtain high-activity catalysts
(Figure 5). Using this method, a library of 2.7 million yeast clones
was screened, especially it was found that mutations at H218 could
enhance PET-degrading activity. This was further conﬁrmed by the
mutant H218Y with signiﬁcantly increased PET degradation (by
approximately twofold). The observed improvement arose via two
synergistic eﬀects: (1) direct non-covalent interactions of Y218 with
the PET substrate, and (2) the subsequent enhancement in enzyme-
substrate binding aﬃnity. However, while surface-displayed PETase
demonstrates remarkable catalytic turnover enhancement, studies
have revealed critical limitations in practical implementation of
whole-cell catalysts that exhibit optimal functionality only at
extremely low concentrations (typically < 0.1 mg/L) (Chen et al.,
2020). This concentration-dependent performance constraint,
particularly evident in heterogeneous catalytic systems, poses
signiﬁcant challenges for scaling up PET biodegradation processes
in real-world environments where high catalyst loading and
operational stability are essential. Overall, this strategy could
eﬃciently address critical limitations in traditional PETase
screening methods that often rely on surrogate soluble substrates.
Moreover, it also enables precise control over enzyme-substrate
ratios through cell-surface engineering strategies.
It must be noted that the N-linked glycosylation might pose
negative eﬀects on the P. pastoris-expressed recombinant protein
(Han et al., 2020; Huang et al., 2013). It was estimated that
N-glycosylations in eukaryotic expression systems could interfere
with the bio-activity of prokaryotic genes. This is extremely true
for the recombinant IsPETase and BurPL expressed in P. pastoris,
although the decreased catalytic activities could be further restored
by de-glycosylation treatment or mutagenesis (Chen et al., 2021).
Similarly, it was also found that N-glycosylation at N181 in
CtPL-DM, a PET-degrading enzyme fromCaldimonas taiwanensis,
would signiﬁcantly reduce its catalytic activity when expressed
in P. pastoris (Li et al., 2023b). This might result in a putative
N-glycosylation site N181, which restrained the conformational
change of the substrate-binding Trp. However, the catalytic
activity could also be restored by removing the N-glycosylation

such as through the N181A mutation. Further de-glycosylation
at additional sites (N181A, N220A, and N261A) show little
eﬀect on the performance of N181A, which further underscores
the importance of the residue N181. Based on these ﬁndings,
performance of N181A was further enhanced via molecular
engineering. The resulting CC mutant ( CtPL-DMR230C/S284C) and
the CtPL-DMN 181A/F235L mutant showed over 60% and ∼20%
increased PET-degrading activity at 60 ◦C, respectively. Notably,
CC variant demonstrated higher catalytic activity at elevated
temperatures, with a 2.5-fold increase at 70 ◦C compared to 60 ◦C.
After 5 days, the CtPL-DMN 181A/F235L-mediated degradation of
amorphous GfPET ﬁlm and reinforced PET resulted in a total
of monomeric products of ∼5 mM and 0.8 mM at 50 ◦C,
respectively.
The structural incompatibility between yeast glycosylation
machinery and bacterial enzymes poses functional challenges
in heterologous expression systems. Speciﬁcally, yeast platforms
(e.g., Yarrowia lipolytica ) exhibit yeast-speciﬁc N-glycosylation
patterns that might disrupt the folding and catalytic activity of
bacterial-derived PET hydrolases like IsPETase. The industrial-
scale implementation of microbial PET degradation systems also
encounters signiﬁcant technical challenges, primarily stemming
from ineﬀective maintenance of extracellular pH levels that
severely impair enzymatic functionality and catalytic stability.
This issue could be compounded by undesirable metabolic
ﬂux diversion toward ethanol accumulation and non-productive
byproduct biosynthesis pathways. To address these challenges,
codon optimization, utilization of glycosylation-reduced strains,

and fed-batch fermentation strategies optimized for PETase
production would be prioritized.
3.1.3 Application of the co-display systems in
engineered cells
Recently, a novel strategy was proposed involving the surface
co-display of engineered PETase variants and MHETase on both
E. coli and P. putida platforms (Figure 6; Xue et al., 2024).
Fluorescence quantiﬁcation identiﬁed YfaL as the most eﬃcient
autotransporter among the tested variants (YfaL, YeeJ, Aom,
and EstP), which exhibits a 4.2-fold higher signal intensity
compared with that of YeeJ. It is further conﬁrmed that
the engineered strains co-displaying DuraPETase and MHETase
exhibited enhanced biocatalytic activity against both BHET and
PET substrates, especially the strain PD5 achieves exceptional
BHET degradation rates over 1 mM/h. Especially, critical
evaluation of catalytic kinetics revealed DuraPETase as the rate-
limiting enzyme governing PET depolymerization eﬃciency in the
dual-enzyme cascade system. Therefore, to enhance the surface
display of DuraPETase, two distinct strategies were implemented.
The initial experimental setup involved two genetically engineered
bacterial strains: UTD1 (lacking the outer membrane protease
OmpT, a key virulence factor implicated in host cell adhesion
and antimicrobial peptide degradation) and ELD1 (with an
inactivated lpp gene to promote enhanced outer membrane vesicle
production, a modiﬁcation associated with compromised envelope
integrity). Second, molecular chaperones were co-expressed under
inducible promoters in strains ECD1 and ELCD1. These strategies
signiﬁcantly improved the PET-degrading activities, especially co-
expression of chaperones in ECD1 resulted in the highest catalytic
activity, achieving 1.82 mM/h on BHET and 0.302 mM/day on
PET powder. However, combining all strategies in strain ELCD1
did not yield higher activity as expected, which highlights the
complexity of optimizing surface display eﬃciencies. Based on
these, engineering of the YeeJ translocator domain resulted in
mutant E9D1 (YeeJI 42F/K 105N/K 106N/D116G/S294G/N 78S/E293V ) and
E33D1 (YeeJ I 42F/K 105N/K 106N/D116G/S294G/N 197K/D358C), which
displayed signiﬁcantly higher PET degradation rates. It is suggested
that reduced chain length and interaction forces were capable of
facilitating secretion eﬃciency. For example, disruption of the salt
bridge (N78S/E293V) in E9D1 increased β-barrel conformational
entropy to enhance substrate threading, while charge-swap
mutations (N197K/D358C) in E33D1 electrostatically dilated the
translocation pore by 2.1 Å. These synergistically optimized the
secretory ﬂux. Especially, strain EC9F exhibited a remarkable PET
degradation rate of 3.85 mM/day, with a 51-fold increase over the
initial strain ED1. Under the optimal conditions, this dual-enzyme
cascade system achieved the highest reported PET degradation rate
of 4.95 mM/day.
Recently, a PT-EC enzymatic consortium was engineered
in E. coli BL21(DE3) through a modular assembly strategy
incorporating the dual-mutant LCC F242A/D238C variant, TfCa
carboxylesterase, and crystalline cellulose-binding module
CBM3, which exhibits a 2.7-fold enhancement in polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) depolymerization eﬃciency compared
to conventional enzymatic systems (Aer et al., 2024a). The
system strategically employs a biomimetic cellulosome-inspired
scaﬀolding architecture, which combines a chimeric cohesin-TB
hybrid scaﬀold with heterologous dockerin domains to establish
a spatially organized multi-enzyme assembly. This design is able
to enhance the proximity-driven catalytic synergism through
optimized spatial arrangement of enzymatic components. In
this way, a <2 nm inter-enzyme spacing within the scaﬀolded
complex could be developed, and a 3.8-fold increase in PET-to-
TPA conversion eﬃciency could be achieved. Finally, the PT-EC
biocatalytic complexes (Figure 7) were precisely anchored on
the E. coli surface via coordinated Lpp-OmpA membrane fusion

and SpyCatcher/SpyTag covalent immobilization. The developed
whole-cell biocatalyst exhibited remarkable thermal stability
and solvent adaptability, maintaining over 80% of its original
catalytic activity even after prolonged incubation at 50 ◦C, while
demonstrating exceptional tolerance to a wide range of organic
solvents including polar and non-polar systems. At 40 ◦C and
pH 7.4, PT-EC EHA achieved 16.5 ±1.2 mM TPA accumulation
within 48 h, which signiﬁcantly surpassed that of PETaseEHA
(1.0 ±0.3 mM). Furthermore, the surface-displayed PT-EC EHA
further exhibited a PET ﬁlm mass loss rate of 2.3 mg/cm 2/day,
a 20-fold improvement over the free enzyme system. In a 7-day
evaluation at 40 ◦C, PT-ECEHA demonstrated exceptional catalytic
eﬃciency with a 4.3 mM increase in product release. While PT-
ECZPE exhibited signiﬁcantly lower degradation activity on PET
ﬁlms ( ≤5% surface erosion), it demonstrated markedly enhanced
performance with amorphous PET powder substrates. Notably,
the hydrolytic products (TPA/EG) showed sustained linear release
kinetics during 7-day incubation, reaching cumulative yields of
11.56 mM ( R2 = 0.98). This dichotomy directly demonstrates
that substrate crystalline structure and enzyme accessibility are
critical limiting factors in enzymatic PET depolymerization
processes. Finally, through combinatorial mutagenesis screening,
a thermostable variant TfCa I 69W/L281Y was identiﬁed, which
demonstrated a 2.5-fold enhancement in the accumulation of
products (TPA/EG). Notably, it could maintain >90% residual
activity after 8 h at 65 ◦C ( t1/2 = 15.3 h) with speciﬁc activity
reaching 38.7 U/mg. This clearly revealed MHET intermediate
accumulation could be eﬀectively alleviated during extended
degradation processes.
Escherichia coli platforms (e.g., with Lpp-OmpA-anchored
IsPETase) excel in rapid engineering, scalability, and compatibility
with synthetic biology tools. However, proteolytic degradation
(e.g., OmpT-mediated cleavage) and insuﬃcient glycosylation limit
their long-term stability. Yeast systems (e.g., P. pastoris displayed
PETase) bypass protease issues and enable eukaryotic post-
translational modiﬁcations. However, unintended N-glycosylation
(e.g., at residue N181 in CtPL-DM) might result in the reduced
catalytic activity unless mitigated via mutagenesis (e.g., N181A).
In conclusion, E. coli remains preferable for scalable whole-cell
biocatalyst production, while yeast systems are better suited for
eukaryotic enzyme optimization.
3.2 Optimizing the metabolic pathways
of the host for PET biodegradation
3.2.1 Metabolic engineering of P. putida
Recent breakthroughs in synthetic biology have enabled the
development of P. putida strains with dual catalytic capabilities: (1)
eﬃcient assimilation of PET monomers via customized metabolic
pathways, and (2) robust extracellular secretion of functional PET
hydrolases through engineered secretion systems (Brandenberg

et al., 2022). This integrated approach leverages modular
genetic circuits for monomer metabolism while employing
Type II secretion machinery to achieve coordinated enzyme
production and extracellular release. It started with chromosomal
integration of the tphII operon from Comamonas sp. E6 into
P. putida KT2440 driven by a constitutive promoter. Subsequent
optimization of TA assimilation was achieved through adaptive
laboratory evolution (ALE) coupled with targeted mutagenesis
of the MhpT transporter system. To address transcriptional
repression mediated by the GclR regulator on glycolate (Gcl)
and glyoxylate (GlxR) metabolism, parallel ALE campaigns were
also conducted. P. putida TA7-EG with a nonsense mutation
in gclR (PP_4283) resulted in truncated GclR protein and de-
repressed C2 metabolism. P. putida TA7-BD acquiring a missense
mutation in PP_2046 (putative transcriptional regulator) shows
signiﬁcantly enhanced 1,2-butanediol (BD) utilization eﬃciency.
Building upon this foundation, a modular surface display system
was engineered using diﬀerent membrane anchors (EhaA secretion
system, InaV ice nucleation protein, and OprF porin) for
extracellular PET hydrolase presentation. In addition, the chimeric
architecture also contained: (1) OprF signal peptide for periplasmic
translocation; (2) catalytic domains (HiC, LCC, or IsPETase
mutants); (3) ﬂexible glycine-serine linker (G4SGGS(G4S)3); and
(4) C-terminal transmembrane anchor. These are all under the
regulation of rhamnose-inducible PrhaB promoter. Results revealed
P. putida TA7-EG transformants exhibited 1.3ñ2.5-fold enhanced
esterolytic activity, and the OprF-HiC chimera demonstrated peak
performance as 2.68 ±0.15 U/ml. Notably, rhamnose-induced
expression triggered signiﬁcant growth defects (30%ñ45% biomass
reduction), particularly in LCC-expressing strains, which might
highlight the enzyme-speciﬁc cytotoxicity. Moreover, to achieve
temperature-responsive transcriptional regulation of heterologous
expression, two thermoregulated systems were engineered: (1) the
λ phage-derived cI857/PL system employing a thermosensitive
repressor, and (2) a synthetic P IbpA variant incorporating
Pseudomonas aeruginosa IbpA-5′UTR modiﬁcations. It was
shown that the engineered P IbpA enabled robust PET hydrolase
production (0.92 ± 0.08 mg/L extracellular protein) with
minimal growth compromise (12% biomass reduction). The
pLo-PIbpA-EhaA-LCC recombinant system exhibited temperature-
responsive activation kinetics, achieving a 10 4-fold increase
in esterolytic activity (212.4 ± 8.7 U/mg) at 30 ◦C, which
is a 37% improvement over λ PL-regulated counterparts.
Notably, this performance was optimized through a controlled
temperature gradient protocol (25ñ30◦C for 6 h), which eﬀectively
mitigated proteotoxic stress-induced biomass loss from 45%
to 12% while preserving extracellular PET hydrolase activity
at 212.4 ±8.7 U/mg. This temperature-modulated expression
strategy aligns with recent advancements in enzyme thermal
stability engineering, where gradual thermal adaptation has
been shown to enhance both catalytic eﬃciency and cellular
viability in heterologous expression systems. The optimized
method demonstrated remarkable eﬃcacy in protein aggregation
control, achieving a 2.3-fold reduction in misfolded protein
accumulation. Moreover, it eﬀectively maintained cellular viability
at over 85%, while simultaneously addressing the growth
defects characteristic of LCC-expressing strains through direct
intervention in aggregation-related pathways. Based on these,
chromosomal integration of PIbpA-PET hydrolase expression
cassettes in the engineered P. putida strains was achieved. While
this genomic integration strategy eﬀectively balanced hydrolase
expression with cellular viability, it resulted in a concomitant
reduction in overall enzyme production levels. Notably, P. putida
KT2440 carrying the P IbpA-bglx-HiC construct achieved a 25%
mass reduction in PBAT-starch-PLA copolymer ﬁlms within
6 days. When extended to a 4-week incubation period, the
engineered strain P. putida TA7-BD expressing the same enzyme
system mediated approximately 40% depolymerization eﬃciency
for the copolymer substrate. Although the PET upcycling cell
factory constructed in this study demonstrated limited autotrophic

eﬃciency, it uncovered critical challenges in engineering robust
microbial chassis systems for industrial-scale applications. The
study revealed three key engineering challenges in heterologous
hydrolase expression systems, including (1) growth impairment
caused by metabolic burden, (2) host protease-dependent enzyme
degradation, and (3) suboptimal transmembrane transport of
polymeric substrate degradation intermediates. The enduring
challenges inherent in microbial metabolic networks highlight
fundamental limitations demanding systematic investigation,
particularly focusing on: (1) carbon ﬂux maldistribution during the
integration of heterologous pathways, (2) insuﬃcient regeneration
capacity of energy currencies (ATP/NADPH) under suboptimal
metabolic states, and (3) redox imbalance triggered by exogenous
enzymatic systems.
Extensive biochemical studies have established that most
microbial systems employ the canonical glycerate pathway for
EG assimilation (Mückschel et al., 2012; Franden et al., 2018;
Werner et al., 2021). This oxidative metabolic route involves
sequential enzymatic conversions through intermediates like
glycolaldehyde (GA) and glyoxylate, ultimately yielding CO 2 as
the terminal oxidation product with suboptimal carbon eﬃciency.
However, this process necessitates supplementary reducing
equivalents (NADH/FADH2) and ATP , which poses critical
industrial bottlenecks through three interconnected mechanisms:
(1) growth arrest triggered by redox cofactor depletion, (2)
pathway ﬂux oscillations induced by energy deﬁcits, and (3)
cumulative metabolic stress from auxiliary enzyme overexpression.
Recent advances in synthetic metabolism have revealed the
β-hydroxyaspartate cycle (BHAC) as a biochemically streamlined
route that bypasses decarboxylation steps while preserving carbon
ﬁdelity (Figure 8; Schada von Borzyskowski et al., 2019; Roell
et al., 2021). It involves a coordinated system comprising four
key enzymes encoded by the Bhc gene cluster: the PLP-dependent
aminotransferase (BhcA), serine/threonine dehydratase (BhcB),
β-hydroxyaspartate aldolase (BhcC), ornithine cyclodeaminase
(BhcD), and along with an IclR-family transcriptional regulator.
This multi-enzyme complex catalyzes the eﬃcient conversion of
two glyoxylate molecules into oxaloacetate through an energy-
conserving mechanism that requires only one NADH equivalent
while maintaining complete carbon retention (without CO 2
release) (Schada von Borzyskowski et al., 2019).
Based on these mechanistic insights, the potential of
implementing the BHAC pathway in P. putida KT2440
was investigated through strategic engineering of glycerate
metabolism (Schada von Borzyskowski et al., 2023). Core enzymes
(BhcC/BhcB/BhcD) were ﬁrst tested in E. coli chassis strains
with incremental metabolic demands (Figure 9A). Glycolate was
selected over toxic glyoxylate, leveraging endogenous conversion
capacity. In aspartate-auxotrophic 1aspC/1tyrB E. coli grown
on glycerol/glycolate/glycine, the full BHA shunt enabled growth
(18.2 ±0.4 h doubling), whereas pathway-deﬁcient controls failed.
Tyrosine limitation was identiﬁed as the bottleneck, alleviated by
1 mM supplementation (13.0 ±0.4 h doubling), which indicates
precursor ﬂux redirection might compensate the auxotrophy.
Based on the initial testing in E. coli , structure-guided
engineering of P. putida KT2440 was employed to replace native
glycerate metabolism with the BHAC pathway aiming to enhance
PET degradation capabilities while maintaining the metabolic
robustness. Upon integration of the complete BHAC pathway into
P. putida KT2440 1gcl (Figure 9B), the engineered strain P. putida
1gcl + BHAC demonstrated immediate growth initiation on EG-
containing medium, bypassing the adaptive lag phase required
by its counterpart. Enzymatic assays revealed activities of the
heterologous BHAC pathway components at ∼0.5 and 10 U/mg,
which highlights the distinct catalytic eﬃciencies between key
enzymes. Furthermore, the BHAC-equipped strain exhibited a 5%ñ
10% increase in growth rate compared to P. putida KT2440 E6.1, a
derivative previously optimized via ALE to metabolize EG through
the native glycerate pathway. This enhancement underscores the
metabolic superiority of the synthetic BHAC route over the
naturally evolved glycerate-dependent system in terms of carbon
utilization eﬃciency and kinetic performance.
Proteomic proﬁling of the strain P. putida 1gcl + BHAC
uncovered a systemic metabolic rewiring, which is characterized
by the following points. (1) The downregulation of
glycolytic/gluconeogenic nodes (PycAB, Mqo1, and MaeB)
coupled with upregulation of oxaloacetate decarboxylase (Oad),
which establish oxaloacetate as the predominant entry point
for TCA cycle inﬂux. (2) Diverting carbon ﬂux from glyoxylate
shunt through decreased malate synthase (GlcB) activity and
elevated succinate dehydrogenase (SdhAB) levels. This reveals
preferential routing of acetyl-CoA through canonical TCA
oxidation rather than bypass mechanisms. (3) Aspartate-to-TCA
rechanneling via upregulated aspartate transaminases, which
enables nitrogen-eﬃcient α-ketoglutarate synthesis. (4) Activation
of glycine salvage pathways is achieved through enhanced glycine
cleavage system components, which is capable of facilitating
serine/pyruvate interconversion to maintain redox balance. (5)
Cofactor provisioning via PdxB-mediated pyridoxal 5 ′-phosphate
(PLP) biosynthesis is associated with creating a self-reinforcing
loop to sustain BHAC enzyme activity and biomass accretion. This
multipronged adaptation highlights the metabolic prioritization of
BHAC-mediated EG assimilation over native routes, which would
achieve energy and redox balance through streamlined carbon
funneling into the TCA cycle.
Finally, to further optimize chassis performance, ALE was
applied to P. putida KT2440 1gcl + BHAC. The evolved
strain demonstrated a 35% increase in speciﬁc growth rate
(µ = 0.42 ±0.03 h−1) and 20% higher maximum biomass density
(OD600 8.7 ±0.2) under 20 mM EG. Genomic analysis identiﬁed
subtle mutations in the bhcABCD expression module and key
genomic adaptations. It mainly involve: (1) regulatory adjustments
caused by a LysR-family transcriptional regulator ( lldR) mutation
and altered expression of lactate utilization and glycolate
metabolism regulators (regB); (2) redox rebalancing resulting from
the upregulated lldD (lactate dehydrogenase) and dld2 (D-lactate
dehydrogenase), driven by thelldR mutation capable of modulating
pyruvate-lactate interplay; (3) systemic optimization including the
enhanced RegAB (redox sensors) and CioA (cytochrome oxidase)
expression, the remodeling of electron transport chain and the
ﬁne-tuned central carbon/amino acid metabolism. These multi-
tiered adaptations synergistically enhanced redox homeostasis
and substrate channeling into the TCA cycle, maximizing EG
assimilation. This work establishes a chassis with engineered
metabolic robustness for PET-derived EG upcycling, bridging
biodegradation and sustainable chemical synthesis.

closed-loop strategy for plastic waste valorization through

(70◦C). Kinetic analysis showed peak TPA and EG production
rates of 4.1 ±0.3 and 2.1 ±0.2 mM ·h−1, respectively, within
the ﬁrst 24 h. Gravimetric and HPLC analyses conﬁrmed
47.2% ±2.1% depolymerization eﬃciency with near-complete
surface erosion (92%ñ95%), while bulk crystallinity remained
stable (Xc > 0.45) over 120 h. However, an 18.7% eﬃciency decline
was observed between 24 and 120 h, which was attributed to
synergistic factors: (1) arrhenius-driven thermal deactivation of
LCC (Ea = 58.2 kJ·mol−1) and (2) TPA-induced acidiﬁcation (1pH
1.8) causing non-competitive inhibition, as evidenced by 3.2-fold
Km increase and 68% Vmax reduction. These results enabled
development of two distinct metabolic pathways in Pseudomonas
species for bioplastic monomer biosynthesis. Firstly, it was
conﬁrmed that that PET hydrolyzate showed no growth inhibition
on P. putida KT2440 and Pseudomonas umsongensis GO16,
moreover the latter showed enhanced growth possibly caused by
the capability of utilizing TPA as an additional carbon source. The
metabolic engineering of P. umsongensis GO16 for enhanced EG
utilization was accomplished through carbon source-directed ALE
under EG-limiting conditions. The optimized strain KS3 exhibited
remarkable performance, achieving complete EG assimilation
(1.7 ±0.2 g/L) within 9 h while demonstrating a maximum speciﬁc
growth rate ( µmax) of 0.32 h −1. Upscaling to 5-L bioreactors
revealed distinct substrate utilization patterns, achieving complete
TPA depletion within 23 h (q TPA = 0.45 g/gCDW/h) compared to
extended EG consumption (q EG = 0.13 g/gCDW/h). The process
yielded 2.3 g/L biomass, with nitrogen limitation inducing PHA
accumulation reaching 0.15 g/L (6.5% cell dry weight).The ﬁnal
yield reached 0.21 g CDW/g substrate, with the C8ñC12 PHA
proﬁle closely matching that of the TPA-fed controls, which
thereby conﬁrmed the metabolic ﬁdelity. Furthermore, it was
elucidated that EG might be primarily routed to de novo fatty
acid synthesis due to its high redox potential, while TPA required
complementary pentose phosphate/TCA pathways. Then, the
genetically engineered P. umsongensis GO16 KS3 was used to
produce HAAs, reaching a concentration of 35 mg/L. The strain
preferentially synthesized HAAs from TPA and utilized EG for
growth, with a production rate of 5 mg/L/h and a yield of 0.01
gHAA/gT PA . The obtained HAAs were conﬁrmed to be a mixture of
four congeners with hydroxydecanoate as the main hydroxy fatty
acid. This process is believed to not only diverts PET from waste

streams but also produces a bioplastic with diverse applications,
showcasing an eﬀective circular economy approach.
In a similar study, PET oligomers derived from chemical
recycling were fully converted into monomers through bio-
depolymerization, which were then utilized for the production
of PHAs by a co-culture of two genetically modiﬁed microbes
(Liu P. et al., 2023). Firstly, E. coli BL21 (DE3)-LCC ICCG was
used as the chassis cell to express the PET hydrolase LCC ICCG
capable of degrading the PET oligomers into monomers, and the
continuous metabolism of these produced oligomers. It was shown
that BL21(DE3)-LCCICCG is able to depolymerize 76.9% of the PET
oligomers into 0.61 g/L MHET, 5.48 g/L TPA, and 2.87 g/L EG after
72 h of cultivation at 30◦C. Especially, within 24 h, BHET could be
fully degraded.
Given that MHET was determined to be an inhibitor for
LCC in the PET degradation (Barth et al., 2016), the helper
enzyme IsMHETase was therefore expressed inP. putida KT2440 to
accelerate the hydrolysis of MHET into TPA and EG. Moreover, the
native EG metabolic pathways of P. putida KT2440 were improved
by the deletion of gclR gene, the overexpression of glycolate oxidase
gene and the insertion of tph gene cluster. The resulting stain
P. putida KT2440-1RDt (Figure 10) could grow rapidly with TPA
and EG as the only carbon sources, and the OD 600 reached 14.77
after 74 h. By this strain, 16.67 g/L TPA could be completely
metabolized within 74 h with a catabolic rate of 0.22 g/(L ·h).
About 1.37 g/L PHA could be obtained from 16.67 g/L TPA and
6.08 g/L EG, furthermore the yield could be increased to 1.53 g/L
after deletion of the endogenous PHA depolymerase gene phaZ
(forming P. putida KT2440-1RDt-1Z). Moreover, overexpression
of PHA synthase ( phaC1) under the control of P 46 revealed that
the obtained P. putida KT2440-1RDt-1ZP46C is able to catalyzed
the formation of 1.90 g/L PHA. Then, the two engineered host
were applied for the biosynthesis of PHA from PET oligomers in
one pot, and a low level of MHET (0.28 g/L) was detected at 12 h
during the co-cultivation process. The yield of PHA was 1.10 g/L
with a conversion rate of 0.11 gPHA/goligomer, and the products were
mainly consisted of 3-hydroxydecanoate (60.88%) and 3-hydrox-
yoctanoate (23.67%). This conversion rate might be the currently
highest level for the biosynthesis of utilizing PET or PET monomers
as substrate.
3.2.2 The application of synthetic biology in the
construction of chassis cells for PET up-recycling
Integrated with emerging PET degradation and recycling
technologies, the strategic repurposing of recovered monomers
for synthesizing new PET materials or high-value derivatives
presents a promising sustainable solution. To advance circular
economy objectives in plastic waste management, a biosynthetic
platform in engineered E. coli MG1655 RARE was developed
that enables direct biological conversion of PET-derived TPA
into vanillin-a commercially signiﬁcant ﬂavor compound and
chemical precursor (Sadler and Wallace, 2021). In this engineered
metabolic pathway, four key enzymes are essential for the
bioconversion process (Figure 11): terephthalate 1,2-dioxygenase
(TPADO), dihydroxy-3,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-dicarboxylic acid
dehydrogenase (DCDDH), carboxylic acid reductase (CAR), and
catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT). For the biotransformation
of TPA to vanillin, recombinant E. coli strains were engineered to
co-express three essential plasmids: pVan1 (encoding TPADO),
pVan2 (harboring the Nocardia iowensis CAR gene, NiCAR),
and pSfp (containing the phosphopantetheinyl transferase
gene required for CAR activation). Results showed that with
added TPA (5 mM), a much lower yield of vanillin (5 µM,
<1% conversion) was achieved. Notably, in this process the
intermediates protocatechuate, dihydroxybenzaldehyde, and
vanillic acid are also detected with the yields of 18, 10, and
2 µM, respectively. After optimization of the protein expression,
reaction conditions and the cell membrane permeabilization of
TPA, the conversion rate achieved was as high as 79% increased
by ∼157-fold. Finally, biotransformation of post-consumer PET
bottle into vanillin was investigated by coupling this metabolic
pathway with LCCWCCG-catalyzed PET hydrolysis (Tournier et al.,
2020). Results showed that the yield of vanillin reached to 68 µM,
when the two stepwise reactions ﬁnished after 24 h. Though this
strategy demonstrates potentials in the biological upcycling of
post-consumer plastic waste into special value-added chemicals,
great attentions should be paid to further improving the lower TPA
concentrations. This is believed to be the rate-limiting step for a
circular and sustainable bio-PET economy.
In another study, a novel artiﬁcial microbial system was
developed for eﬃcient biodegradation of PET, which was
constituted of R. jostii, P. putida and two metabolically engineered
B. subtilis (Qi et al., 2021a). Firstly, the two-step PET-degrading
metabolic pathways were achieved with two metabolically
engineered B. subtilis . The ﬁrst strain was engineered to
heterologously express Bs_PETase, mediating the depolymerization
of PET to MHET. The second strain was designed to express
Bs_MHETase, enabling hydrolytic cleavage of MHET into TPA
and EG. This functional segregation optimizes catalytic eﬃciency
by spatially separating the sequential enzymatic reactions within
specialized microbial chassis. Results demonstrated enhanced
depolymerization eﬃciency in this dual-species microbial system,
which achieved complete hydrolysis of 2 g/L BHET within 22 h,
with concurrent degradation of 13.6% (weight loss) of amorphous
PET ﬁlms over 7 days. However, inhibitory eﬀects from TPA and
EG were also observed during BHET degradation, especially the
released TPA signiﬁcantly suppressed host cell proliferation. To
address this limitation, R. jostii RHA1, a strain renowned for its
robust aromatic compound catabolism, was integrated, which
resulted in complete degradation of 2 g/L TPA within 28 h. This
strategy eﬀectively alleviated the TPA-mediated growth inhibition,
and enabled a tripartite microbial consortium to hydrolyze 2 g/L
BHET within 20 h. Especially, the optimized system achieved
31.2 ±2.2% weight loss of PET within 7 days, representing a
17.6% enhancement. Finally, P. putida KT2440 was introduced
with the purpose of relieving the inhibitory eﬀect caused by
EG, which is capable of transforming EG into acetaldehyde.
However, it was shown that the growth of the other three bacteria
would be strongly inhibited by P. putida when co-cultivated in
nutrient-rich media. This was ﬁnally tackled with a selective
medium species (inorganic salt media, W) with the addition
of ammonium sulfate and potassium nitrate, and sucrose and
glucose as dual carbon sources. In this way, BHET (2 g/L) could
be completely degraded within 20 h catalyzed by the four-species
microbial system without detectable accumulation of TPA and EG.
Following optimization, the PET ﬁlm demonstrated a weight loss
of 7.9 ±0.78 mg within 7 days, and the depolymerization rate

reached as high as 23.2 ±2.3%. However, the degradation rate of
the four-species microbial system was lower than that obtained
with the three-species system (31.2±2.2%), which might be caused
by the nutrient-poor medium. Overall, this study highlights a novel
idea for eﬃcient biodegradation of PET in a greener way catalyzed
with the artiﬁcial microbial consortia. However, a thorny issue still
needs to be resolved that is how to address the issue of achieving
appropriate growth rates among diﬀerent microbial strains during
the co-fermentation process.
3.2.3 Dual enzyme system for PET recycling
Recently, a thermophilic carboxylesterase (Est30) was
engineered for eﬃcient PET-depolymerization by relieving the
inhibitory eﬀect caused by the accumulated MHET (Zhang
J. et al., 2023). It was mainly focused on (1) establishing
a hydrogen-bonding network to stabilize transition-state
conformations through carboxyl terminus binding, and (2)
enhancing hydrophobic interactions surrounding the MHET
benzene ring. Initial computational screening identiﬁed 11 out

of 14 variants with improved MHET hydrolysis eﬃciency at
50◦C (pH 7.5), among which M8 (Est30 I 171K/G130L), M13, and
M14 (Est30 I 171K/M127S/G130L) exhibited remarkable catalytic
enhancements of 36. 0-, 62. 1-, and 96.3-fold, respectively.
Structural analysis demonstrated conserved active-site architecture
(RMSD = 0.62 Å) and oxyanion hole geometry relative to the
wild-type enzyme, while variant M14 exhibited a unique lid
domain reorientation toward the hydrolase domain. Molecular
dynamics (MD) simulations revealed that engineered mutations
preserved critical hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic stacking
interactions, demonstrating their role in transition-state
stabilization. The thermostable variant M8 (T m = 67.58 ◦C,
designated as KL-MHETase) demonstrated optimal activity
under FAST-PETase-compatible conditions. Then a dual-enzyme
system combining KL-MHETase and FAST-PETase (2:6 ratio)
achieved 2.6-fold faster PET depolymerization and 1.64-fold
higher TPA yield (99.5% purity) compared to FAST-PETase
alone. However, the initial reaction kinetics revealed competitive
binding between KL-MHETase and FAST-PETase, which suggests
the need for spatial optimization. To address this limitation,
researchers developed fusion enzymes using ﬂexible (Gly-Ser)n
linkers to connect FAST-PETase with M14 (KLS-MHETase).
The engineered mutant KL36F demonstrated enhanced catalytic
synergy via an eﬃcient MHET channeling system, achieving
82.9% PET conversion (1.12-fold increase), 82.5% TPA yield
(1.64-fold enhancement), and 99.5% product purity (1.47-fold
improvement) under standard reaction conditions. Linker
ﬂexibility enabled proper orientation of active sites for direct
MHET transfer, eﬀectively preventing intermediate accumulation.
At 0.35 µM loading, KL36F sustained MHET levels below

inhibitory thresholds ( <0.5%), while suboptimal enzyme
dosing underscored the need for MHETase reﬁnement. In
industrial-scale trials (100 g/L PET), KL36F achieved >90%
depolymerization eﬃciency, yielding 89.0% TPA with >99%
purity, demonstrating robust scalability, and commercial viability.
Comparative studies with other dual-enzyme systems, such
as PETase/ 1BsEst and PETase/ 1ChryBHETase (producing
663.1 and 617.6 µM TPA, respectively), further conﬁrm the
general eﬃcacy of cascade enzymatic strategies. Collectively, these
advancements demonstrate potential to establish sustainable plastic
circularity through enzyme-driven valorization processes, while
achieving operational cost reductions via streamlined downstream
processing.
Similar studies further validate the eﬃcacy of cascade
enzymatic systems for PET depolymerization. Engineered BHETase
variants ( 1BsEst and 1ChryBHETase) with 3.5-fold improved
catalytic eﬃciency ( kcat/KM) were incorporated into synergistic
systems with PETase (Li et al., 2023a). The PETase/ 1BsEst and
PETase/1ChryBHETase combinations demonstrated exceptional
performance, producing 663.1 and 617.6 µM TPA within 24 h,
which represents a 7.0- and 6.5-fold increases, respectively over
PETase monotherapy (95 µM). This enhancement mechanism
parallels the KL36F system, where coordinated actions between
PET-degrading and intermediate-processing enzymes prevents
metabolic bottlenecks. The observed TPA yields (82.5%ñ89.0%)
and purities (>99%) across diﬀerent dual-enzyme systems further
highlight its generalizability for industrial-scale plastic valorization.
These ﬁndings corroborate the broader applicability of dual-
enzyme cascades in establishing closed-loop PET recycling
paradigms.
Recent advancements in enzymatic PET degradation have also
led to the development of an innovative dual-enzyme system
that operates through signal peptide-independent secretion (Aer
et al., 2024b). This system employs a bifunctional chimeric enzyme
(designated TfH-FPE), which is created by fusing FAST-PETase
with TfH, a phospholipase capable of modifying cell membrane
permeability. The TfH component facilitates extracellular secretion
of the fusion enzyme while simultaneously enhancing substrate
accessibility through membrane modulation. Results showed
that this synergistic design signiﬁcantly improves the bio-
depolymerization eﬃciency of PET compared to single-enzyme
approaches. The engineered TfH-FPE chimeric enzyme achieved
a secretion yield of 104 ±5.2 mg/L under optimized conditions,
representing a 32.5-fold enhancement over conventional signal
peptide-dependent systems. The enhanced secretory eﬃciency
directly underpinned superior PET depolymerization eﬃcacy, with
TfH-FPE demonstrating sixfold increased product titer relative to
standalone FAST-PETase and twofold elevated yield vs. equimolar
discrete enzyme cocktails under identical operational parameters.
In addition, kinetic characterization revealed substantial functional
improvements in the fusion enzyme, including a 4.7-fold increase
in hydrolysis rate constant ( kcat/Km) and 4.1-fold enhanced
substrate adsorption aﬃnity toward PET ﬁlms at 50 ◦C. Time-
course analyses demonstrated temperature-dependent degradation
proﬁles, and the product accumulation reached saturation
(8.9 ±0.3 mM) within 48 h at 50 ◦C, while exhibiting sustained
linear release kinetics over 7 days at 40 ◦C. Notably, despite
showing 1.5-fold greater cumulative product yields than FAST-
PETase at 40 ◦C, TfH-FPE displayed counterbalanced kinetic
properties with a threefold reduction in hydrolysis rate but 4.1-
fold higher PET binding aﬃnity. The decoupled catalytic kinetics
and substrate adsorption proﬁles reveal the bifunctional merits of
the fusion architecture, including prolonged operational stability
through strengthened substrate binding, and the attenuated
product inhibition achieved via spatial segregation of hydrolytic
domains.
Moreover, the TfH-FPE fusion enzyme also exhibited superior
PET depolymerization kinetics across all experimental conditions,
which is capable of achieving maximal eﬃciency at 50 ◦C with
12.2 ±0.9 mM product release, a twofold greater than equimolar
mixtures of standalone FAST-PETase and TfH. This might be
mechanistically linked to enzyme colocalization eﬀects, where
spatial proximity between the phospholipase and PETase domains
minimizes substrate diﬀusion barriers and enables cooperative
catalysis. Importantly, this study establishes two paradigm-
shifting innovations in enzymatic PET recycling. The autonomous
secretion framework, a signal peptide-independent secretory
mechanism, would enable eﬃcient extracellular delivery of multi-
domain biocatalysts (104 ± 5.2 mg/L yield). The synergistic
interfacial catalysis mechanism integrates TfH-driven membrane
permeabilization for enhanced substrate accessibility with FAST-
PETase-mediated processive hydrolysis, which would establish a
dual-functional cascade that optimizes both catalytic initiation and
chain-scission eﬃciency. This tandem action achieved 4.7-fold
faster PET ﬁlm deconstruction compared to monofunctional
systems. Collectively, these advantages position the TfH-FPE
system as a paradigmatic framework for next-generation
biocatalyst design: (1) autonomous platforms circumventing
upstream protein engineering constraints through self-suﬃcient
catalysis; (2) spatially optimized cascade architectures bypassing
diﬀusion barriers via enzyme colocalization; and (3) thermostable
systems preserving functional integrity across industrial processing
temperatures (40ñ50◦C).
The integration of PETase and MHETase into dual-enzyme
systems eﬀectively mitigates intermediate product inhibition (e.g.,
MHET accumulation), thereby achieving signiﬁcantly enhanced
PET degradation eﬃciency through synergistic catalytic action.
In contrast, single-enzyme systems (e.g., free LCC ICCG) usually
required exogenous MHETase supplementation to alleviate
inhibition, which might complicate the process design. Dual-
enzyme consortia outperformed single systems by 50-fold in
PET-to-TPA conversion due to synchronized depolymerization
and intermediate metabolism (Diao et al., 2023).
3.3 Metabolic engineering of Yarrowia
lipolytica
Yarrowia lipolytica (Cao et al., 2023; Park and Ledesma-
Amaro, 2023; Liu Y. et al., 2024) is of great signiﬁcance in the
biotech ﬁeld as it can eﬃciently produce a variety of valuable
metabolites like lipids and polyols, and has been widely applied in
the food, cosmetic and biofuel industries. As a premier microbial
model, it enables mechanistic dissection of metabolic networks and
cellular dynamics, serving as a translational platform bridging basic
research in core biological principles with applied innovations in
industrial biotechnology.

3.3.1 Direct heterologous expression of
PET-degrading enzymes in Y. lipolytica
Recent advances have demonstrated successful heterologous
expression of a codon-optimized PETase gene in Y. lipolytica for
direct PET degradation (Kosiorowska et al., 2022b). The PETase
coding sequence (GenBank: GAP38373.1) was codon-optimized
for yeast expression and placed under the transcriptional
control of the native XPR2 secretion signal to facilitate enzyme
extracellular secretion. The optimized expression cassette was
subsequently integrated into the genome of Y. lipolytica
strain AJD2, generating the engineered strain AJD 2 pAD
PET_IS. Functional characterization revealed successful secretory
production of active PETase without causing signiﬁcant growth
defects. However, during PET degradation assays, both the
engineered strain and AJD2 control failed to assimilate TPA
monomers, and this contrasted with previous observations by
Costa et al. (2020), where the Y. lipolytica derivatives demonstrated
TPA utilization. This phenotypic discrepancy may be attributed to
diﬀerences in cultivation conditions or strain-speciﬁc metabolic
capabilities. Notably, both strains exhibited EG assimilation
capacity, and the engineered AJD 2 pAD PET_IS strain achieved
complete hydrolysis of MHET to TPA within 96 h. When applied
to PET degradation, TPA accumulation became detectable in
AJD 2 pAD PET_IS culture supernatants for 120 h, whereas
neither TPA nor BHET were observed in AJD2 controls. These
metabolic proﬁles diﬀer signiﬁcantly from the TPA utilization
patterns reported by Costa et al. (2020), which suggests potential
strain-speciﬁc diﬀerences in aromatic compound metabolism
or variations in experimental conditions. Further optimization
revealed that supplementation with speciﬁc metal ions markedly
enhanced PET depolymerization eﬃciency. The addition of 2.5 mM
MnSO4 and 1 mM CuSO 4 increased TPA yields to 75 mg ·L−1
(7.5-fold enhancement) and 62 mg ·L−1 (6.2-fold enhancement),
respectively. Most remarkably, incorporation of 1% (w/v) olive oil
into the culture medium achieved a maximum TPA of 124 mg·L−1.
This synergistic eﬀect likely stems from the dual function of olive
oil as both a hydrophobic surface-modifying agent and an inducer
of endogenous lipase production, which may collaboratively
enhance PET accessibility and enzymatic hydrolysis through
interfacial activation mechanisms. Intriguingly, cultivation in 0.3-L
Erlenmeyer ﬂasks revealed growth inhibitory eﬀects associated
with salt supplementation, which could be potentially linked
to suboptimal oxygen transfer eﬃciency and altered cellular
proliferation kinetics. This contrasts with improved biomass
accumulation observed in scaled bioreactor systems, where
enhanced aeration and nutrient distribution likely mitigated the
ionic stress eﬀects documented in ﬂask-scale experiments. Notably,
olive oil supplementation induced pronounced physicochemical
changes in PET substrates, including the accelerated surface
corrosion, and substantial polymer mass reduction (53.05%±2.1%
of initial mass). These alterations correlated with enhanced
biodegradation eﬃciency, potentially through amphipathic
compound-mediated bioﬁlm formation and increased polymer
surface hydrophilicity. This integrated approach demonstrates
substantial potential for synergistic PET bioremediation during
yeast cultivation, where microbial proliferation and enzymatic
depolymerization proceed concurrently. The scale-dependent
parameter optimization highlights the necessity for bioreactor-
speciﬁc condition tailoring to maximize degradation eﬃciency
while maintaining culture viability.
3.3.2 Metabolic engineering and fermentation
engineering of Y. lipolyticafor PET-cycling
Recently, a novel co-cultivation system for the upcycling of
PET waste was developed, which is capable of PET-degradation
and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) biosynthesis (Figure 12; Liu
et al., 2021). Y. lipolytica Po1f was ﬁrstly engineered to express
IsPETase. The system achieved signal peptide-free secretion of
functional IsPETase through innovative utilization of SP LIP2,
a truncated secretory module derived from the Lip2-encoded
extracellular lipase. Proteomic characterization revealed this hybrid
secretion system enhances PETase yields by 3.8-fold compared
to conventional signal peptide-dependent approaches, which
establishes SPLIP2 as a universal cargo-transport scaﬀold for yeast-
based biocatalyst production. This bifunctional design overcomes
traditional bottlenecks in secretory pathway engineering, enabling
continuous PET hydrolysis ( ≥72 h) with 92% monomer recovery
eﬃciency from post-consumer waste streams. Then, a TPA-
degrading strain Pseudomonas stutzeri TPA3 was employed for the
biosynthesis of PHB, which was achieved by the integration of the
phbCAB operon from Ralstonia eutropha . It was conﬁrmed that
the resulting P. stutzeri TPA3P was capable of bio-synthesizing
PHB, and 11.56 wt% of cell dry weight PHB could be accumulated
from 10 g/L TPA as the sole carbon source. Co-cultivation of
P. stutzeri TPA3P and Y. lipolytica Po1f with glucose and BHET
as carbon sources enables the direct conversion of BHET to PHB,
achieving 5.16 g/L BHET hydrolysis in 12 h and 3.66% PHB
accumulation in 54 h. In addition, the biomass ofP. stutzeri TPA3P
was shown to experience a signiﬁcant decrease toward the end of
the cultivation, which was likely caused by a deﬁciency in TPA or
other unidentiﬁed factors. Though, the ultimate yield of PHB did
not meet expectations (due to the low eﬃciency of IsPETase), this
approach oﬀers a promising strategy for PET waste biodegradation
and upcycling using engineered microorganisms.
To address the issue of low reaction eﬃciency caused by
IsPETase, a novel strategy has been proposed that facilitates
the continuous conversion of PET to muconic acid (MA)
with an engineered strain of P. putida KT2440 (Figure 13;
Liu et al., 2022). Firstly, the pcaHG gene (encoding the
protocatechuate 3,4-dioxygenase) was replaced by the tph
cluster to enhance the utilization of TPA and inhibit the
metabolic pathway of protocatechuate. Then aroY gene (encoding
protocatechuate decarboxylase) and ecdB gene (encoding the ﬂavin
prenyltransferase) were integrated for the catalytic conversion of
protocatechuate to catechol. In addition, MA metabolic pathway
was further optimized by deletion of the downstream catBC to
eﬀectively halt the subsequent β-ketoadipate (β-KA) pathway. The
engineered strain P. putida KT2440-tac demonstrates the capability
to synthesize 4.63 mM of cis-MA from 12.86 mM TPA. However, it
is noteworthy that accumulated protocatechuate was also observed
during this process. To relieve the inhibition caused by the gclR
regulator, deletion of the gclR and overexpression of the glycolate
oxidase gene ( glcDEF) under the control of Ptac were successfully
achieved. The resulting P. putida KT2440-tacRD was further
engineered to express PET hydrolase LCC, and the obtained host

KT2440-tacRDL was capable of PET-degradation and growing
on EG simultaneously. The crude LCC, expressed by P. putida
KT2440-tacRDL, was capable of catalyzing minimal accumulation
of BHET ( <0.23 mM). As anticipated, the concentration of
MHET exhibited an initial increase followed by a gradual decline,
culminating in the production of 43.66 mM TPA at a rate of
0.15 g/(L·h) within a 10 ml reaction system. Under the optimized
condition, P. putida KT2440-tacRDL is able to produce 32.33 mM
MA at a rate of 0.54 mmol/(L ·h). Notably, EG metabolism appears
to be markedly suppressed in LB medium, a phenomenon initially
hypothesized to stem from β-ketoadipic acid accumulation based
on prior metabolic engineering studies (Werner et al., 2021).
However, experimental evidence from β-ketoadipate ( β-KA)
pathway knockout models revealed persistent metabolic inhibition,
which strongly suggested the existence of alternative regulatory
mechanisms beyond this pathway. This paradoxical observation
underscores the necessity for systematic investigations into
the multifaceted regulatory network governing EG catabolism,
particularly focusing on potential cross-talk between central
metabolic pathways and quorum-sensing systems in microbial
consortia.
Recently, a groundbreaking biocatalytic strategy has also
been developed for direct PET degradation through metabolic
engineering of Y. lipolytica (Kosiorowska et al., 2022a; Janek
et al., 2020). This system combines extracellular expression
of lipase (YlLip2) with F. solani -derived cutinase (FsC) in a
synergistic enzymatic approach. The initial optimization involved
overexpressing YlLip2 in Y. lipolytica A101 using a high-eﬃciency
hybrid promoter (UAS1B16-TEF). To maximize enzyme yield,
genomic modiﬁcations were implemented through deletion of
two native proteases (AEPp and AXpp), yielding Y. lipolytica
AJD 1X1A-Lip2. Biochemical characterization revealed optimal
YlLip2 exhibits maximum enzymatic activity under optimal
conditions of 37◦C and pH 8.0. Notably, the enzyme demonstrated
exceptional tolerance to lipopeptide biosurfactants (amphisin and
viscosinamide), and enhancements of 160% and 200% could
be achieved at 0.2 and 0.15 mM concentrations, respectively.
This positive eﬀect appears to involve surfactant-mediated
enhancement of substrate-enzyme interactions at the catalytic
site. Based on these ﬁndings, FsC was further overexpressed
resulting in the host Y. lipolytica AJD 2 pAD CUT_FS for
the metabolism of PET. With this host cell, increased levels
of degradation products (e.g., TPA and MHET) were achieved,
reaching 1.51 and 0.45 g ·L−1, respectively, after 240 h in
a 1 L bioreactor. Although, bioprocess scaling demonstrated
remarkable scalability, the PET degradation eﬃciency quantiﬁed
(the TPA to MHET ratio) in various culture systems was
found to be diﬀerent. It was 0.55:1 in deep well plates
(DWP), rose to 2.95:1 in ﬂask cultures, and impressively
peaked at 4.63:1 in bioreactor cultures. The progressive increase
in TPA dominance correlates with the biomass-dependent
cutinase production dynamics (Vertommen et al., 2005). Scanning
electron microscopy conﬁrmed substantial surface erosion of
PET ﬁlms, which could provide visual validation of degradation
eﬃcacy. Additionally, systematic screening identiﬁed critical media
components capable of enhancing PET depolymerization in
DWP cultures. A total of 2.5 mM calcium chloride (CaCl 2)
could maximize TPA release and minimize MHET release, when
combined with 2.5 mM MnSO 4 and 2.5 mM MgSO 4. Moreover,
2.5 mM MnSO 4 and MgSO4 alone could signiﬁcantly reduce the
MHET levels. This engineered biocatalytic platform demonstrates
substantial potential for industrial PET biorecycling applications,
combining genetic engineering optimization with bioprocess
parameter tuning to achieve enhanced polymer breakdown
eﬃciency.
3.3.3 Solid-state fermentation of Y. lipolyticafor
PET depolymerization
In a recent study, the potential of Y. lipolytica for PET
depolymerization was systematically investigated under both solid-
state fermentation (SSF) and submerged cultivation conditions
(Sales et al., 2021; Sales et al., 2022). The eﬃcacy of three

low-cost inducers (apple peels, commercial cork, and PET) was
evaluated for enhancing lipase and esterase production during SSF
of soybean bran by Y. lipolytica . It was shown that addition of
5 or 20 wt% of commercial cork would result in a 16% increase
in lipase activity and a remarkable 131% increase in esterase
activity, respectively. In addition, the incorporation of PET into
the fermentation process also signiﬁcantly boosted the esterase
activity of the enzymatic extracts by up to 69%. Notably, enzymatic
extracts derived from fermentation samples supplemented with
20 wt% PET and 20 wt% apple peels could achieve the highest
concentration of TPA (21.2 µM) after 1 week. Meanwhile,
enzymes from cork-enriched SSF demonstrated superior eﬃciency
in hydrolyzing BHET, a key PET degradation intermediate. In
addition to the biocatalysts produced by Y. lipolytica through SSF ,
the lipase B from Candida antarctica (CALB) was also added
in this PET-degradation process. It was shown that the enzymes
were capable of hydrolyzing BHET, producing TPA (131.31 M),
and PET, leading to a TPA concentration of 42.80 M after
168 h.
Submerged cultivation in YT medium (1% yeast extract, 2%
tryptone) achieved a TPA concentration of 65.40 µmol L−1 after
96 h. Tryptone-containing media (e.g., YT and YTD) would also
signiﬁcantly enhance the secretion of PET-hydrolytic enzymes.
When scaling to a 0.5-L benchtop bioreactor, yield of TPA could be
further improved to 94.31 µmol L−1, which is 121% higher than
SSF-derived results. While these results highlight the promise of
Y. lipolytica-derived biocatalysts in PET depolymerization, critical
gaps still remain including: (1) mechanistic insights into enzymatic
PET hydrolysis; (2) optimization of biosurfactant and catalytic
protein production; (3) proﬁling of microbial cell adhesion and
PET monomer assimilation; and (4) promising strategies to sustain
enzymatic activity and cell viability during prolonged degradation.
Recent advances in metabolic engineering have enabled the
development of optimized biodegradation pathways for PET
through systematic comparison of prokaryotic and eukaryotic
enzymatic systems. For prokaryotic systems, P. putida chassis
strains demonstrate remarkable PET-hydrolyzing capabilities
through engineered secretion systems of Is PETase enzymes.
Conversely, eukaryotic platforms like Blastobotrys spp. oﬀer
distinct advantages in post-translational modiﬁcation and
compartmentalized expression of PET-depolymerizing enzymes,
particularly when utilizing hybrid pathways combining fungal
cutinases with yeast secretory mechanisms. This dichotomy
highlights the complementary potentials of microbials in
developing consolidated bioprocesses for PET waste valorization.
Especially, the glycolytic pathway of P. putida eﬃciently channels
EG into the TCA cycle via glyoxylate shunt catalysis, which
would lead to complete mineralization. However, Blastobotrys
spp. employ alternative PCA decarboxylation pathways but lack
robust glyoxylate shunt activity, which might result in limited
EG utilization. Collectively, the modular metabolic networks and
solvent tolerance make P. putida as a superior chassis for PET
upcycling, whereas eukaryotic systems might be less developed for
large-scale applications.
3.4 Rational design of enzyme-PET
interface engineering
Immobilization of PETase enzymes signiﬁcantly enhances
the eﬃciency of PET biodegradation, as it allows the enzymes
to be reused multiple times and maintain their activity under
various conditions (Schwaminger et al., 2021). Moreover, it
also plays a crucial role in the practical application of PET
biodegradation, enabling more stable and eﬃcient degradation
processes in industrial settings and contributing to the reduction
of environmental pollution caused by PET waste.
A breakthrough in enzymatic plastic degradation has been
achieved through the development of MC@CaZn-MOF , a
hierarchically structured biocatalytic composite engineered for
in situ PET surface remodeling (Zhang et al., 2024). The MOF-
based system integrates three key innovations, including the
chemoselective immobilization of cutinase variants, the surface-
adaptive topology, and the dynamic hydration regulation. The
protein engineering strategy involved two key modiﬁcations

Liu et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2025.1599470
to optimize enzymatic performance. Initially, the hydrophobin
(HFBI), a self-assembling interfacial protein, was genetically
fused to the N-terminus of IsPETase through a ﬂexible (G4S)2
linker, creating the chimeric protein HFBI- IsPETase. To enable
modular assembly, the SpyCatcher/SpyTag conjugation system
was incorporated by fusing SpyCatcher to the C-terminus of
HFBI-IsPETase and SpyTag to MHETase, yielding HFBI-IsPETase-
SpyCatcher and MHETase-SpyTag constructs respectively. This
covalent peptide-protein ligation system facilitates irreversible
molecular coupling through spontaneous isopeptide bond
formation between SpyCatcher and SpyTag. Through SpyC/SpyT-
mediated self-assembly, a multienzyme complex (designated
HPCTM) was successfully constructed, which synergistically
combines surface-active HFBI domains with complementary
enzymatic activities. Biochemical characterization revealed
that HPCTM exhibited enhanced BHET hydrolysis eﬃciency
surpassing both free PETase and the PETase + MHETase
combination. Moreover, improved interfacial properties were
evidenced by a 39 ◦reduction in the WCA of PET surface (from
84.2◦ to 45.1 ◦), and superior PET degradation performance
was achieved with 27.3% weight loss (1.6-fold improvement).
Additionally, eﬃcient metabolic channeling resulted in the
release of 253 µM TPA while maintaining a low MHET
intermediate level (20 µM). Notably, the HFBI-mediated surface
localization combined with enzyme colocalization through
SpyC/SpyT conjugation created a catalytic nanoenvironment
that simultaneously enhancing substrate accessibility, promoting
intermediate transfer, and minimizing product inhibition.
Then HPCTM was immobilized onto the nanoparticles
CaZn-MOF forming the biomimetic module (MC@CaZn-MOF)
with a Zn: Ca ratio of 2:3 and HPCTM concentration of
0.6 mg/ml. MC@CaZn-MOF displayed an improved BHET-
hydrolyzing activity with 340 µM TPA and 22.5 µM MHET
produced after 12 h, and the WCA could be further decreased to
47◦. Notably, MC@CaZn-MOF was capable of directly breaking
down untreated AGf-PET, and the weight loss (96%) was 6.3-fold
higher than that of HPCTM after 5 days. Especially, it is also capable
of eﬃciently breaking down PET bottles, with a maximum release
of 9.2 mM PET monomers after 5 days. The material demonstrated
exceptional long-term durability, thermal stability, extended
storage stability under ambient conditions, and remarkable
recyclability over multiple cycles without signiﬁcant performance
degradation. This groundbreaking platform technology pioneers a
novel paradigm for integrated cascade enzymatic depolymerization
and microbial bioassimilation systems, showing particular eﬃcacy
in handling complex mixed-plastic waste streams under non-sterile
environmental conditions.
3.5 Metabolic engineering of microalgal
for enhanced PET-degradation
Recent advances have demonstrated the potential of green
microalgal chloroplast systems for sustainable bioproduction of
IsPETase and plastic biodegradation applications (Di Rocco et al.,
2023). A pioneering approach involves constructing a synthetic
IsPETase gene cassette incorporating three critical components:
(1) codon-optimized sequences tailored for chloroplast expression,
(2) an N-terminal Sec-type signal peptide to facilitate protein
translocation across thylakoid membranes, and (3) the psbH
photosynthesis gene as a dual-functional element serving both as
a selection marker and photosynthetic restoration module. This
engineered construct was cloned into the pSRSapI vector, and
subsequently introduced into Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strain
TN72 at a neutral locus between psbH and trnE2, restoring
the wild-type copy of psbH. The optimized design achieved two
pivotal advancements: (1) the psbH marker enabled chloroplast
transformation selection via phototrophic restoration, eliminating
reliance on antibiotic resistance genes; (2) the signal peptide
directed the enzyme translocation to the thylakoid lumen-an
oxidizing subcellular environment that promotes proper disulﬁde
bond formation. Then, SDS-PAGE analysis and tandem mass
spectrometry of cell extracts from the TN72:PETase.1 cell line
conﬁrmed the presence of PETase. Especially, atomic force
microscopy (AFM) imaging showed that the enzyme is capable of
inducing morphological changes, such as the formation of holes,
on both PET and PCP samples. This was also conﬁrmed by the
quantitative analysis with a decrease in surface correlation length
(ξ, from 2.2 ±0.6 to 0.22 ±0.08 µm for PET ﬁlm, and from
0.53 ±0.1 to 0.21 ±0.03 µm for PCP) and an increase in surface
roughness ( 1σrmsPCP = + 17.5 nm) for PCP. This might result
from the fact that the technical-grade PET foil is more resilient
to stress than postconsumer plastic foil. The PETase activity was
further veriﬁed by the digestion of PET powder and BHET, which
yielded 0.02 mM TPA and 0.8 mM monomer products, respectively.
However, for PCP only 0.20 mM BHET was detected without TPA,
which might be caused by the low reaction temperature (30◦C) and
a relatively short catalyzing period.
In this study, a platform for producing PETase in the
chloroplast of C. reinhardtii was successfully established. Although
the recombinant protein yield was lower than that of bacterial
systems, the activity of the algal-expressed enzyme in terms
of TPA release was in line with published data for the wild-
type protein. This paves the way for future studies focused on
producing improved PETase variants and other plastics-degrading
enzymes to combat marine plastic pollution in this sustainable
platform. Especially, the microalgae oﬀer several advantages for
PETase production, such as reduced scale-up costs, and the
ability to precisely target transgenic DNA into the plastome via
homologous recombination.
3.6 Promising strategy for the
development of novel PET hydrolase
3.6.1 Development of novel high-throughput
screening strategies
To address the limitations of existing methods in developing
potential PETase mutants, a revolutionary platform has been
developed, which is capable of simultaneously evaluating large
PET hydrolase libraries (10 4ñ105 variants) for protein solubility,
thermostability, and catalytic activity (Groseclose et al., 2024).
It uses plate-based split green ﬂuorescent protein assays and
model substrate screens. Generally, this system is composed of
four main parts: (1) generation of a vast library of variants
through DNA shuﬄing; (2) establishment of high-throughput
Frontiers in Microbiology 23 frontiersin.org
fmicb-16-1599470 June 28, 2025 Time: 19:3 # 24
Liu et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2025.1599470
screening to test thousands of variants for activity, expression, and
solubility on BHET substrates; (3) validation of a smaller subset
of these variants using cell lysates and diﬀerent PET substrates
for improved hydrolyzing activity; and (4) characterization of
the top variants using puriﬁed enzymes against various PET
substrates. Each evolution cycle lasts about 6ñ8 weeks, and the
identiﬁed variants would be used in subsequent rounds. After
multiple cycles, the ﬁnal variants are characterized for catalytic
performance using HPLC and bioreactors. For the initial high-
throughput co-screening, genetically tagged variants with GFP11
were evaluated on BHET model substrate agar plates via split GFP
complementation. Enzyme libraries were cultivated on membranes
overnight, induced with IPTG, then transferred to BHET plates
for partial lysis. Plates were incubated at 65ñ70 ◦C for 5ñ20 h. The
integration of BHET hydrolysis with split-GFP complementation
assays facilitated high-throughput screening of colonies exhibiting
enhanced enzymatic activity, improved protein solubility, and
stable expression proﬁles, enabling eﬃcient pre-identiﬁcation of
optimal variants for subsequent industrial applications. Coarse
screening focused on colonies with larger clearing zones or brighter
green ﬂuorescence, which are followed by ﬁne screening in 96-
well plates for thermostability. Promising variants were further
validated on PET substrates. Throughout, selection pressures were
incrementally increased (e.g., BHET concentrations, temperatures,
and durations) to develop optimal mutants.
This platform was used to enhance the catalytic activity
of wild-type LCC (LCC-WT). After two evolution cycles,
LCC-F2 (LCC V 118I/A149V/L159E/V 202I ) showed higher activity
and comparable solubility on BHET agar plates. For high-
crystallinity PET powder degradation, LCC-F2 was 13% more
active than LCC but 23% less active than LCC ICCG. After
the third cycle with increased BHET and temperature, LCC-
F6 (LCC P38L/L117P/A149V/Y 127G/D238C/F243I/S283C) matched
LCCICCG on both PET substrates. The fourth cycle yielded
LCC-B8 and LCC-C9, which signiﬁcantly outperformed
LCCICCG on amorphous PET ﬁlm but were less active on
high-crystallinity PET powder. To improve thermostability, an
additional evolution cycle with preheat treatment and increased
BHET concentration was conducted, resulting in LCC-LANL
(LCCY 127G/D238C/F243I/S283C/P38L/Y 61C/M91I/L117P/A149V/H 218Y/Q
224H /S247L/T 256I ). It showed a 14.3-fold increase in aromatic
product release and a 13.9-fold increase in maximal rate on
amorphous PET ﬁlm compared to LCC ICCG. At 68 ◦C, the initial
rate of LCC-LANL was 1.21 g ·L−1·h−1 TPA and 1.77 g ·L−1·h−1
aromatic products. However, its activity declined after 8 h at 70 ◦C,
possibly due to decreased thermostability or product inhibition.
This is particularly caused by the S247L mutation which boosts
the hydrophobic surface area around the substrate-binding site,
therefore beneﬁting catalysis in the presence of hydrophobic
substrates. Additionally, mutations like M91I and T256I might also
contribute to a more uniform hydrophobic core, which, despite
creating some cavities, could increase the mobility and catalytic
eﬃciency at lower temperatures.
Structural characterization demonstrated that speciﬁc
mutations in the LCC-LANL variant (including S247L, M91I,
and T256I) signiﬁcantly improved catalytic performance on PET
substrates, though these alterations appeared to reduce thermal
stability compared to the parental enzyme conﬁguration. Docking
simulations showed that LCC-LANL has more productive binding
modes for PET substrates than LCC ICCG, which contributes to its
improved catalytic eﬃciency on amorphous PET ﬁlms. However,
this trend was not observed for amorphous PET powder, and this
suggests that milling may aﬀect enzyme-substrate interactions.
Overall, while LCC-LANL demonstrated signiﬁcant improvements
in catalytic eﬃciency on amorphous PET ﬁlm, its thermostability
and performance at elevated temperatures or over extended
periods remain limitations for industrial applications.
A novel high-throughput ﬂuorescence-based screening
platform for PET hydrolases was successfully established,
demonstrating robust performance with a coeﬃcient of variation
(CV) of 17.3% and Z factor exceeding 0.7 (Shi et al., 2023). This
dual-ﬂuorescence detection system integrates mCarmine-labeled
enzyme quantiﬁcation (Ex/Em 603/675 nm) with ﬂuorescein-based
substrate hydrolysis monitoring (Ex/Em 494/525 nm) in 96-well
plate format. The methodology enables simultaneous measurement
of enzyme concentration and catalytic activity through wavelength-
resolved ﬂuorescence detection, eﬀectively eliminating signal
interference between the two ﬂuorophores. Using this method,
about 10,000 clones were screened in three rounds of directed
evolution, leading to the discovery of the promising PETase M5
variant (DepoPETase T 88I/D186H/D220N/N 233K/N 246D/R260Y/S290P).
Its catalytic activity toward BHET-OH increased 1.9-fold, and
M5 is capable of retaining 97.3% of its initial activity at 50 ◦C for
30 min. When depolymerizing gf-PET with M5 at 50 ◦C, complete
degradation occurred in 48 h. After pH adjustment, 14.07 mM
of products (TPA and MHET) were released. The PET-degrading
performance of M5 was similar to FAST-PETase initially, but
surpassed it after 24 h, releasing 16.6% more products. DepoPETase
eﬀectively depolymerized various untreated post-consumer PET
waste in 1.5ñ4.5 days, showing potentials for recycling 10%-
crystallinity PET materials. However, higher-crystallinity PET
needs pre-treatment for better enzymatic depolymerization. In a
scaled-up process, DepoPETase depolymerized 19.10 g of pc-PET
ﬁlm in a 3 L bioreactor at 50 ◦C in 120 h (0.4% W enzyme/WPET,
enzyme loading). The reaction exhibited a rapid initial rate of
0.5 mM per hour for both TPA and MHET, with approximately
70% of the total products being liberated within the initial 48 h.
The subsequent decline in catalytic eﬃciency was likely attributed
to product inhibition mechanisms, which highlighted the critical
importance of maintaining optimal pH conditions to preserve
enzyme structural integrity and maximize catalytic performance.
3.6.2 Surface charge engineering of the PET
degrading enzymes
In a recent study, 24 fungal cutinases were heterogeneously
expressed, in which TaC from Thermocarpiscus australiensis was
particularly eﬀective on PET (Brinch-Pedersen et al., 2024). It
displayed up to fourfold higher catalytic activity and greater
thermal stability than HiC (Hong et al., 2019). However,
the requirement for elevated salt concentrations [primarily
attributed to electrostatic repulsion (Ribitsch et al., 2017)] to
achieve optimal catalytic activity signiﬁcantly limits its practical
applicability in industrial settings. To solve this, surface charge
engineering was explored by creating enzyme variants with
reduced negative charge. Forty TaC variants with decreased
negative surface charge were designed and generated. This was
mainly achieved by neutralizing acidic residues, introducing basic
Frontiers in Microbiology 24 frontiersin.org
fmicb-16-1599470 June 28, 2025 Time: 19:3 # 25
Liu et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2025.1599470
residues through isosteric replacements, co-evolutionary energy-
based selections, and utilization of structural alignments with HiC
for successful residue introductions. Six mutants were identiﬁed
(TaCD41A, TaCE68G, TaCD82A, TaCD41A/E68A, TaCD41A/D82A, and
TaCE68G/D82A) with twofold or higher activity and increased
PET adsorption with low salt dependence. Notably, TaC E68G and
TaCE68G/D82A had catalytic activity matching or exceeding wild-
type TaC under 500 mM NaCl, which is able to eliminate the
salt requirement while maintaining eﬃciency. At 60 ◦C after 24 h,
the most eﬃcient variant, TaC D41A/E68G, degraded about 4.5% of
highly recalcitrant PET powder, more than wild TaC (less than 1%)
and HiC (less than 2%). Given these, the surface charge engineering
strategy is expected to aid in developing PET hydrolases with
balanced substrate-surface aﬃnity.
Similarly, it was found that the cationic surfactant (C 12-
N(CH3)3+) could signiﬁcantly improve (increased by 12.7-fold)
the activity of the PET hydrolase, TfCut2, which possessed
a negative net charge under the experimental pH conditions
(Furukawa et al., 2019). In addition, the cationic surfactant
(cetyltrimethylammonium bromide, CTAB) could enhance the
catalytic performance of TfC (with a net negative charge, increased
by ﬁvefold for the turnover rate) and LCC (with a net positive
charge). This is estimated to result from the cationic nature
of CTAB, which would interact with the negatively charged
enzymes and be capable of probably altering the conformation
and increasing the aﬃnity for the PET substrate (Arnling Bååth
et al., 2022). It was also reported that introduction of the basic
amino acid residues (the positively charged surface residues) to the
PET hydrolase PET2 would also increase the binding rate constant
(PET2 7M, increased by 2.7-fold) and lead to higher catalytic
activity (increased by 6.8-fold) (Nakamura et al., 2021).
3.6.3 Development of the surface crowding
model
Previous research reported that IsPETase shows enzyme-
concentration- dependent inhibition, which is possibly caused
by surface crowding (Avilan et al., 2023; Skóra et al., 2021).
Given this, in a recent study, wild IsPETase and the thermostable
TS-PETase variant ( IsPETaseS121E/D186H/N 233C/R280A/S282C) were
further engineered with a kinetic surface crowding model for
improved catalytic performance and decreased crowding tendency
(Zhong-Johnson et al., 2024). Directed evolution of IsPETase and
TS-PETase resulted in a novel mutant, T116P. When introduced
into TS-PETase (forming TSP-PETase), it increased the maximum
product accumulation rate by 30%. The additionally stepwise
incorporation of the S238N and S290P mutation into TSP-PETase
could all improve the thermostability of the resulting mutants by
∼1.5◦C. However, this modiﬁcation would lead to slightly reduced
peak productivity of the engineered mutants. The decreased activity
was estimated to result in the surface crowding during degradation
process of PET ﬁlms. Fluorescence techniques further conﬁrmed
that IsPETase experiences crowded conditions similar to those
induced by macromolecular crowding agents. MD simulations also
revealed crowding would reduce enzyme ﬂexibility and inhibit
the formation of productive active sites, especially in substrate-
bound enzymes. Although active-site ﬂexibility was less aﬀected,
crowding led to enzyme aggregation and decreased mobility.
These results were further conﬁrmed by the ﬁndings that activity
of IsPETase decreased with increasing Ficoll 70 concentration
(200ñ400 mg/ml), and the decreased BHET conversion matched
simulation results.
This model well-illustrated the higher productivity of
evolved variants TSP and TSPNP , which showed signiﬁcant
crowding eﬀects on catalytic activity. Especially, sensitivity
analysis emphasized the importance of binding capacity ( 0) and
the catalytic rate ( kcat, uc) while reducing the crowding eﬀect
(Kc) for maximum productivity. The model also demonstrated
that increased temperatures could boost TS-PETase variant
productivity by enhancing enzyme binding and catalytic rates,
without the low-temperature crowding inhibition.
The surface-crowding model, which focuses on enzymes
transitioning to a packed state upon adsorption, explains the
decrease in catalytic eﬃciency in crowded environments. It is
crucial for understanding enzyme behavior under such conditions.
Especially, it highlights crowding behavior as a key factor in enzyme
engineering for enhanced PET degradation.
3.6.4 Ancestral protein reconstruction
To date, diverse protein engineering strategies including
random mutagenesis, machine learning, and rational design
have been successfully implemented to enhance PET-degrading
enzymes. Primary optimization targets typically involve substrate-
binding site engineering, modulation of the conserved tryptophan
residue (“wobbling Trp”), and residues proximal to catalytic
disulﬁde bonds. These approaches have yielded improved
enzyme variants such as LCC ICCG, DuraPETase, ThermoPETase,
HotPETase, and FAST-PETas.
In addition, integration of ASR has become an indispensable
approach in computational enzyme design, which would oﬀer
unprecedented capabilities to elucidate evolutionary trajectories
of protein families and systematically identify functionally critical
distal mutations that evade traditional structure-based rational
design (Thomson et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2023; VanAntwerp et al.,
2022). This methodology not only facilitates the resurrection
of ancestral enzymatic properties like thermostability and
conformational plasticity, but also enables targeted engineering
of allosteric networks through evolutionary-guided modiﬁcations
at spatially distant regulatory sites. This methodology involves
the following main steps: (1) phylogenetic reconstruction, (2)
ancestral sequence inference, and (3) computational identiﬁcation
of stabilizing mutations. For example, the integration of ASR with
computational tools like Rosetta-based PROSS (Protein Repair
One-Stop Shop) (Goldenzweig et al., 2016) facilitates systematic
exploration of sequence space for stability-enhancing mutations.
A landmark ASR application was demonstrated in the
engineering of IsPETase (Joho et al., 2023). Researchers
reconstructed ancestral enzymes using GRASP and CodeML
algorithms, which revealed the evolutionary divergence of
IsPETase from actinobacterial cutinases. Concurrently, PROSS-
guided engineering introduced 6ñ27 mutations per variant,
strategically optimizing structural stability while preserving the
catalytic triad (Ser160-Asp206-His237) and active-site architecture
critical for substrate binding. Among 15 engineered variants,
ancestral and PROSS-derived enzymes exhibited up to 20 ◦C
increases in melting temperature (T m), with GrAnc8 achieving
optimal activity-stability balance at elevated temperatures. The
evolutionary trajectory of PET-degrading enzymes reveals that
Frontiers in Microbiology 25 frontiersin.org
fmicb-16-1599470 June 28, 2025 Time: 19:3 # 26
Liu et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2025.1599470
ancestral cutinases exhibited limited substrate promiscuity toward
synthetic polyesters, indicating a functional specialization event
coinciding with the environmental proliferation of PET plastics
since their industrial-scale production.
Structural analyses highlighted key determinants of
thermostability and activity. A disulﬁde bridge in GrAnc2-
GrAnc3 and D186H substitution in GrAnc7-GrAnc8 played
signiﬁcant roles in enhanced stability, whereas mutations near
the substrate-binding site (e.g., R171A and H214S) resulted in
increased PET degradation by ﬁvefold. The H214S mutation
facilitated W185 repositioning to accommodate PET chains, while
its reversion (S214H) in PROSS5 reduced activity by 10-fold.
Evolutionary trajectory analysis revealed an activity-stability trade-
oﬀ, in which the high catalytic eﬃciency of IsPETase correlates
with reduced thermostability, likely reﬂecting recent adaptive
pressures absent in ancestral lineages. Surface charge alterations
showed no functional relevance, and this emphasized the localized
impact of active-site mutations. In addition, two fundamental
principles were suggested in enzyme engineering: (1) PETase
activity emerged recently through functional specialization from
ancestral promiscuous activities; and (2) stabilizing mutations
(particularly those enhancing rigidity) often compromise catalytic
eﬃciency, necessitating balanced optimization strategies.
This work establishes ASR-rational design integration as
a paradigm for enzyme engineering, which enables systematic
exploration of evolutionary sequence space to bypass limitations of
traditional approaches. The identiﬁcation of functional mutation
clusters and stability-activity trade-oﬀs provides a roadmap for
developing industrially viable biocatalysts.
3.6.5 Development of the efﬁcient biosensor for
the rapid detection of enzymatic PET degradation
To advance enzyme- and microbial- mediated PET
degradation, developing highly sensitive screening methods
for PET-degrading enzymes is crucial. Recently, a novel ﬂuorescent
biosensor using Comamonas thiooxidans strain S23, a TPA-
transporting and -metabolizing microorganism, was proposed
(Dierkes et al., 2023). C. thiooxidans S23 was engineered to
transport and metabolize TPA via a special transporter (tripartite
tricarboxylate transporter, TTT) and enzymes encoded in the
conserved tphC-tphA1 operon. The catalytic enzymes are regulated
by the upstream TphR, an IclR-type transcriptional regulator,
and TPA can induce up to 88-fold increase in the transcription
of the tphC-tphA1 cluster. Based on these, C. thiooxidans S23
was genetically modiﬁed to enhance TPA detection sensitivity.
Diﬀerential expression analysis identiﬁed the inducible tphC
promoter, which was upregulated by TPA with a maximum
88.03-fold increase. Subsequently, the sfGFP gene was inserted
between tphR and tphC, generating strain ReporTPA_UHH03. The
strain showed a positive correlation between TPA concentration
and ﬂuorescence signal, with signiﬁcant increases at 10 and 50 mM
TPA, but no further induction at higher concentrations. To further
boost sensitivity, a 3,677-bp deletion of TPA-catabolic genes
(1tphA2A3BA1) was introduced into C. thiooxidans S23, yielding
the ﬁnal bioreporter ReporTPA_UHH04. Its TPA sensitivity was
increased by 10,000-fold. At 1 nM TPA, it exhibited over twofold
ﬂuorescence enhancement and reached maximum response at
50 nM TPA, with no additional ﬂuorescence increase at higher
TPA concentrations. The ReporTPA_UHH04 biosensor is capable
of successfully detecting enzymatic PET degradation catalyzed by
various PETases, which demonstrates high sensitivity and potential
for qualitative assessment of enzymatic activity on PET. It is the
most sensitive bioassay for detecting TPA from PET degradation to
date. With a rapid and simple 1:1 dilution method, it can analyze
enzymatic supernatants within 2ñ4 h, which shows promise
for identifying low-activity PET-degrading microorganisms and
enzymes, and monitoring microbial degradation over time.
Similarly, a combined method of absorption measurements
and proton nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1H NMR) analysis has
also been developed for the qualitative and quantitative analysis
of PET degradation products (Kornberger et al., 2024). However,
to ensure measurement accuracy, further optimization of several
key parameters is necessary, including solvents, pH levels, and
drying techniques. Once these conditions are optimized, the
absorption method can achieve sensitivity thresholds of 2.5ñ5 µM,
and the 1H NMR analysis can reach 5ñ10 µM. This approach
can signiﬁcantly enhance the precision of PET degradation
measurements, which is vital for plastic waste recycling and
environmental conservation, thus contributing to the mitigation of
the plastic waste problem.
3.6.6 Rational protein design via loop exchange
In a recent study (Blázquez-Sánchez et al., 2023), eﬀorts were
focused on enhancing the catalytic activity of the antarctic enzyme
Mors1, which could degrade PET at moderate temperatures
(25◦C). A chimeric design approach, speciﬁcally loop exchange
(Romero and Arnold, 2009), was used to improve the activity
and stability of Mors1. A chimeric enzyme (CM, chimeric Mors1)
was constructed by replacing the β8-α6 loop in Mors1 with a
shorter loop from LCC. This substitution led to the loss of a
disulﬁde bridge and complete loss of enzymatic activity in CM.
However, adding a cysteine residue to CM (variant CM A266C)
to reintroduce the disulﬁde bridge could restore its ability to
degrade polycaprolactone (PCL). Notably, CM A266C had a higher
optimal temperature for PET degradation (45 ◦C) compared to
Mors1 (25 ◦C). At 45 ◦C, CM A266C was more active than Mors1,
while at 25 ◦C, its activity was lower. The PET-degrading activity
of CM A266C against amorphous PET ﬁlms at 25 ◦C was ﬁvefold
higher than that of wild Mors1. MD simulations of Mors1 and
the CM variant suggested that the enhanced activity resulted
in the changes in local ﬂexibility within the extended loop and
adjacent active-site regions, rather than the entire enzyme. For
CMA266C, the modiﬁed loop and nearby regions showed increased
movement compared to Mors1, and this extra movement was not
temperature-induced, as Mors1 did not exhibit such changes at
diﬀerent temperatures.
This research highlights the potential of protein engineering,
speciﬁcally loop exchange at the catalytic site loop, to boost the
eﬃciency of PET-degrading enzymes. It oﬀers a novel way to
enhance enzyme performance without extensive modiﬁcations,
where the increased ﬂexibility in speciﬁc regions of the new enzyme
likely contributes to its improved function. By employing more
loop swaps and computational tools, it may be possible to develop
even more eﬃcient enzymes for low-temperature PET degradation.
This could lead to more sustainable waste management strategies
and help reduce the environmental impact of plastic pollution.

3.6.7 Glutathione S-transferase used for
PET-degradation under mild conditions
Recently, researchers explored the capacity of glutathione
S-transferase (GST), a mammalian-origin enzyme mainly involved
in detoxiﬁcation, to degrade PET particles and plastic bottle debris
under mild conditions (Huang et al., 2024). GST was found to
eﬃciently degrade PET particles. Under ambient conditions with
a PET-to-enzyme ratio of 22.5 kg/mg or physiological conditions
at 1 atm, the degradation eﬃciency reached up to 95.9%, and
the degrading process follows ﬁrst-order kinetics with a rate of
2.6 g·L−1·h−1. When particle size decreased to less than 150 nm,
the degradation eﬃciency climbed to 98.9%, also following ﬁrst-
order kinetics. However, the degradation process was inhibited
by acetonitrile (ACN) and small-molecule GST inhibitors, with
a signiﬁcant reduction in eﬃciency. Additionally, factors like
light irradiation, temperature, pH, and the presence of humic
acid (HA) or protein would all aﬀect the catalytic performance
of GST. Notably, light irradiation was shown to be capable of
enhancing the activity of GST, which revealed its adaptation to
photo-oxidative stress and potential involvement in light-regulated
signaling pathways.
A novel enzymatic pathway for PET depolymerization
was proposed, where GST-mediated degradation predominantly
involves nitration and oxidative cleavage mechanisms rather than
conventional hydrolysis-based mechanisms. This conclusion was
substantiated by the observed progressive enrichment of nitrogen
(from 0.5% to 4.7%) and oxygen (from 18.7% to 61.6%) alongside
carbon depletion (73.5%ñ67.7%) during degradation, coupled with
characteristic spectral signatures of -C = O- and -C = N- bond
formation. This process also enhanced the ﬂexibility of the active
site, which is also crucial for improved PET-degrading activity.
Besides GST, the study tested other mammalian-origin
enzymes such as trypsin and CYP450 for PET degradation.
Although showing potentials, the degradation eﬃciencies were
lower than that of GST. This implies that mammalian-origin
enzymes may play a role in plastic metabolism within organisms,
including humans. This discovery oﬀers a potential sustainable
and eco-friendly approach to combat plastic pollution. The
study not only proposes an innovative approach to plastic
pollution mitigation but also advances the comprehension of
plastic metabolic pathways and environmental persistence in
biological systems. Furthermore, it elucidates the multifaceted
mechanisms through which naturally occurring enzymatic systems
degrade synthetic polymers, revealing catalytic strategies ranging
from radical-mediated oxidative cleavage to processive enzymatic
depolymerization.
3.6.8 Synergistic strategies for PET
biodegradation
Recently, a novel approach for PET biodegradation was
proposed, which mimics the enzymatic mechanisms in plant cell
wall hydrolysis (Taxeidis et al., 2024). This strategy centered
on combining Fusarium oxysporum cutinase with an anionic
surfactant like sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The combination
signiﬁcantly enhanced the hydrolysis of amorphous and semi-
crystalline PET, with 2.3-fold and 1.6-fold higher eﬃcacies
respectively. The improvement was ascribed to the change in
surface tension, which enhanced enzyme access to the PET
substrate. The use of enzyme cocktails and surfactants for
PET degradation under mild conditions suggests potential for
industrial-scale, and eco-friendly plastic waste management.
When cutinase was combined with ferulic acid esterases (FAEs),
it achieved complete conversion of PET intermediates to TPA, and
the product release was increased by up to 1.9-fold in the presence
of a surfactant. The combination of cutinase and glucuronoyl
esterase (GE) could also improve the degradation yields in semi-
crystalline PET by up to 1.4-fold. The novel function of MtFae1, an
enzyme from the CE-1 family in the CAZy database, was further
veriﬁed to exhibit MHETase activity, highlighting its potential in
PET degradation.
The signiﬁcance of surfactants in promoting PET breakdown
was also conﬁrmed by using PEG to stabilize a Humicola insolens
cutinase (HiC) variant for enhanced PET biodegradation (Feng
et al., 2024). Under optimal conditions, adding 1% w/v PEG
signiﬁcantly increased the production of PET hydrolysis by-
products. PEG600 was particularly eﬀective, yielding a 64.58%
increase compared to using HiC alone. In-depth studies revealed
that PEG modiﬁes the overall protein structure, enhancing catalytic
performance. Additionally, PEG improved PET hydrolysis by
reducing surface tension, thus increasing the interaction between
HiC and PET.
3.6.9 Development of switchable enzyme mimics
for PET degradation
Inspired by native enzyme structures and catalytic mechanisms,
recent research has successfully developed enzyme mimics to
tackle PET pollution (Figure 14; Li et al., 2023c). Designed
peptides capable of self-assembling into enzyme-like structures can
depolymerize PET through a mechanism switchable by pH and
temperature changes. In this study, two peptides (PV and PT) were
designed. They incorporated the serine-histidine-aspartate active
sites, similar to the catalytic triad in PETase, and were combined
with the self-assembling polypeptide MAX. Puriﬁed peptides were
dissolved in deionized water and added to TrisñHCl buﬀers at
diﬀerent pH values. The peptide solutions were incubated at room
temperature for 24 h for self-assembly. Under varying pH and
temperature conditions, these peptides underwent conformational
transitions from random coil to β-sheet structures, aﬀecting their
catalytic activity.
Both PV and PT enzyme mimics are capable of eﬀectively
hydrolyzing PET, releasing MHET and TPA without BHET in the
reaction mixtures. Enzymatic activities increased with the increase
of pH and temperature, peaking at pH 9.0 and 65 ◦C, and the
PT peptide ( ∼10 µM) showed higher catalytic activity than PV
(∼5 µM). pH changes likely altered amino acid charge states,
which result in conformational changes in the enzyme mimics
and the catalytic active site. Histidine residues were crucial in
the catalytic mechanism, potentially acting as a general base to
deprotonate serine residues for nucleophilic attacks. Over time, the
increase in TPA and decrease in MHET indicated that PET was the
initial primary substrate, and MHET becomes the main substrate
as the reaction proceeded. The enzyme mimics could maintain
the structural integrity after PET hydrolysis. MD simulations
showed that the enzyme mimics formed ﬁber-like constructs rich
in β-strands. Peptide PT, with a random coil and β-sheet mixed
structure, had more structural ﬂexibility and higher PET-binding

aﬃnity. Docking analysis suggested that the high catalytic activity
for PET degradation result in the stable peptide-ﬁber formation
and ordered molecular conformations, which is mainly driven by
hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions.
These results highlight that the switchable enzyme mimics
hold promise as materials for degrading PET and reducing
environmental pollution.
3.6.10 Integrated chemical-biological upcycling
of PET waste through engineered Rhodococcus
jostii
To establish a sustainable solution for PET waste management,
an innovative chemical-biological hybrid platform was developed
coupling alkaline depolymerization with microbial valorization
(Diao et al., 2023). The strategy centers on an engineered strain
of R. jostii PET (RPET) capable of simultaneously metabolizing
both TPA and EG monomers derived from PET hydrolysis,
while converting these substrates into high-value lycopene. The
engineering process involved a systematic multi-step approach: (1)
in silico identiﬁcation of carotenoid pathway components through
whole-genome sequencing; (2) implementation of arabinose-
inducible expression system (PBAD promoter) to regulate thecrtEBI
operon enhancing carbon ﬂux from isopentenyl pyrophosphate
(IPP) and dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP) precursors; (3)
targeted knockout of lycopene β-cyclase gene ( crtL-β) to prevent
carotenoid diversiﬁcation; (4) combinatorial overexpression of
methylerythritol phosphate (MEP) pathway genes ( dxs and idi) to
amplify precursor supply; and (5) construction of synthetic operons
for coordinated expression of rate-limiting enzymes. Notably,
alkaline pretreatment achieved 98.7% PET depolymerization
eﬃciency (w/w) within 6 h at 80 ◦C, which generated hydrolyzates
containing 12.4 g/L TPA and 6.8 g/L EG. When cultivated in fed-
batch bioreactors using PET hydrolyzate as the sole carbon source,
the engineered RPET strain demonstrated remarkable lycopene
productivity, reaching 1.32 ±0.15 g/L ñ a 523-fold enhancement
compared to wild-type controls. This bioconversion eﬃciency
represents a signiﬁcant advance over previous enzymatic PET
recycling systems, which typically focus on monomer recovery
rather than value-added chemical synthesis (Li A. et al., 2024).
These ﬁndings establish a proof-of-concept for closed-
loop PET valorization, where plastic waste is transformed
into commercially relevant antioxidants through synergistic
chemical and biological processing. Its unique capacity to utilize
both PET-derived monomers while tolerating osmotic stress
positions it as a promising chassis for developing circular
economy solutions in plastic waste management. However,
it should be also noted that the engineered strains (e.g.,
R. jostii RPET) expressing heterologous pathways for TPA/EG
metabolism and value-added product synthesis could inadvertently
transfer genetic constructs to environmental microbes, potentially
disrupting ecosystems. While prevailing research prioritizes
functional enhancements in microbial consortia-such as promoter
optimization and chassis stabilization-critical biosafety dimensions
remain underexplored. This includes systematic implementation
of containment mechanisms (e.g., auxotrophic dependencies and
CRISPR-based kill switches) and ecological monitoring protocols to
track genetic stability post-deployment, which must be rigorously
embedded within consortium engineering frameworks. Future
work should prioritize risk-mitigation frameworks, such as
orthogonal genetic systems or CRISPR-based biocontainment, to
align the ecological promise of consortia with biosafety imperatives.

3.7 Synergistic microbial-enzymatic
degradation of PET waste via a novel
lipase-enzyme consortium
Recently, an innovative biocatalytic platform combining
Microbacterium oleivorans JWG-G2 with T. fusca cutinase (TfC)
was established to synergistically degrade BHET oligomers and
high-crystallinity PET ﬁlms (Figure 15; Y an et al., 2021). Notably,
PET exposure induced a 1.6-fold increase in M. oleivorans cell
density accompanied by 60% elevation in extracellular esterase
activity ( p < 0.01), which suggested the substrate-responsive
secretion of hydrolytic enzymes. Crucially, a previously unreported
PET degradation intermediate, ethylene glycol terephthalate
(EGT), was identiﬁed during microbial treatment. EGT exhibited
inhibitory eﬀects analogous to MHET in enzymatic hydrolysis
systems (Barth et al., 2015a) necessitating combinatorial biocatalyst
design.
The engineered consortium achieved remarkable degradation
eﬃciencies through sequential action: (1) co-treatment enhanced
BHET oligomer degradation by 2.79-fold and PET ﬁlm
depolymerization by 2.26-fold with the ﬁnal products MHET
(330 ±28 nM) and TPA (47 ±5 nM); (2) 3.2-fold increased
surface roughness was revealed on PET ﬁlms after combinatorial
treatment, indicative of cooperative bio-abrasion and enzymatic
hydrolysis; (3) 47 putative PET-degrading genes were identiﬁed
in M. oleivorans by whole-genome sequencing, including ﬁve
hydrolases; and (4) biochemical characterization highlighted
Lip19-8, a lidless lipase encoded by gene 19_8, as the key
biocatalyst. Structural modeling revealed an exposed catalytic
triad (Ser160-His285-Asp255) within a spacious substrate-binding
pocket (1.342 Å), which is capable of enabling accommodation of
bulky PET oligomers. Functional studies demonstrated its capacity
to sequentially hydrolyze PET into BHET, EGT, and MHET,
while TfC complementarity alleviated EGT-mediated inhibition to
complete TPA liberation.
This work elucidates a two-tier degradation mechanism:
(1) M. oleivorans -secreted hydrolases initiate PET surface
amorphization and primary depolymerization, and (2) TfC
executes terminal hydrolysis of inhibitory intermediates. The
microbial-enzymatic synergy outperforms conventional single-
modality approaches by 208% in total monomer recovery,
establishing a prototype for overcoming crystallinity barriers in
plastic bio-recycling.
Recent advances in microbial-enzyme consortia have
demonstrated signiﬁcant improvements in PET degradation
eﬃciency through complementary bio-physicochemical
mechanisms. A representative study (Huang et al., 2022) revealed
that Stenotrophomonas pavanii JWG-G1 pretreatment followed by
TfC treatment is able to achieve 91.4% ±2.3% PET ﬁlm weight
loss. This enhancement was mainly attributed to microbial surface
modiﬁcation to facilitate enzymatic accessibility, as a 32% increase
in surface roughness and a 10.7% reduction in hydrophobicity
(WCA: from 96.6◦±2◦to 86.3◦±2◦, p < 0.05) were quantiﬁed.
Parallel developments in thermophilic systems further validate
this synergy. A consortium combining Bacillus thermoamylovorans
JQ3 with the engineered PETase LCC ICCG achieved 65.1%
PET mass reduction within 48 h under optimized conditions
(1.8-2.4 × 108 CFU/ml microbial density; 6.25ñ12.5 µg/ml
enzyme dosage) (Y an et al., 2024). Kinetic analysis revealed
peak depolymerization activity (3.0 mg PET ·h−1) and TPA
productivity (2.7 mg ·h−1) during 24ñ36 h, and the complete
degradation was achieved across a broad substrate range (30ñ
360 g/L PET) within 96 h. Notably, this system distinguishes
itself from M. oleivorans -TfC consortia (Y an et al., 2021) by
omitting intermediate oligomer degradation (e.g., EGT formation)
and instead prioritizes direct TPA liberation through: (1) bioﬁlm-
mediated enzyme immobilization, where microbial colonization
enhanced PETase adsorption by 4.8-foldvia extracellular polymeric
substance-driven surface adherence; and (2) metabolic coupling,
wherein microbial assimilation of soluble TPA (up to 53 µM)
sustained population viability (OD 600 ≥0.82), establishing a self-
perpetuating degradation cycle.
Combinatorial assays demonstrated that Ces39_5-LCC ICCG
co-treatment maximized TPA accumulation (53 µM), and it
outperformed single-enzyme systems by 7.2-fold. Structural
simulations revealed the expanded substrate-binding cleft of
Ces39_5 (1.580 Å vs. 1.210 Å in Lip4_120), enabling eﬃcient 2-HE
(MHET)5 processing.
These systems exemplify two distinct synergistic
paradigms for PET-degradation. The surface-modifying
consortia ( S. pavanii + TfC), which is capable of
prioritizing physical PET amorphization to potentiate
enzymatic hydrolysis. The metabolically integrated systems
(B. thermoamylovorans + LCCICCG) are able to leverage microbial
catabolism to sustain enzymatic activity. While thermophilic
systems oﬀer operational stability (50ñ75 ◦C tolerance), their TPA
yields remain constrained [ ≤53 µM vs. 330 µM in mesophilic
systems (Y an et al., 2021)] due to microbial substrate competition.
Nevertheless, the low enzyme demand [12.5 µg/ml vs. 50 µg/ml
in conventional processes (Shabbir et al., 2020)] positions them
as economically viable for industrial-scale PET biorecycling.
Future optimization of multi-enzyme cascades (e.g., Ces39_5-
Lip4_120-LCCICCG combinations) might bridge this yield gap
while maintaining process sustainability.
3.8 Molecular engineering of
photosynthetic microorganisms
Photosynthetic microorganisms like algae, when adhering
to plastic surfaces, secrete ligninolytic and exopolysaccharide
enzymes crucial for plastic degradation (Barone et al., 2024).
With the progress of synthetic biology, the potential of using
the marine microalga Phaeodactylum tricornutum to degrade PET
plastics has been explored (Moog et al., 2019). This involved
genetically modifying P. tricornutum to produce and secrete
PETaseR280A-FLAG (an engineered PETase from I. sakaiensis ),
which could release PETase into the surrounding medium.
Degradation products, mainly TPA and MHET, were detected in
the micromolar range. At 30 ◦C, using the culture supernatant,
the secreted PETase showed activity against both PET and the
copolymer polyethylene terephthalate glycol (PETG). Notably,
the turnover rate for low-crystallinity PETG [total products
(MHET + TPA) 26.32 µM] was ∼80-fold higher than that for
bottle PET [total products (MHET + TPA) 0.31 µM]. The diatom-
produced PETase remained active against industrially shredded

PET in a saltwater environment, even at 21 ◦C. SEM analysis of
PET treated with PETaseR280A-FLAG revealed signiﬁcant surface
disruptions, conﬁrming biodegradation.
In a related study, the green microalgae C. reinhardtii (CC-
124 and CC-503) were used to express the PET-degrading enzyme
PETase for treating plastic waste (Kim et al., 2020). A codon-
optimized PETase gene was inserted into a high-strength expression
vector pBR9_PETase_Cre, and then was transformed into the
microalgae via electroporation. Western blot analysis showed that
CC-124 could eﬀectively express PETase, while CC-503 had poor
growth and expression. Incubating PET samples with cell lysates
from the transformed CC-124 microalgae detected TPA, indicating
PET hydrolysis. For PET powder from scratched bottles, a 35.17%
conversion to TPA (about 9.12 mg from 30 mg of PET powder)
was achieved after 4-week incubation. PET ﬁlms showed no change
after 2-week incubation with cell lysates but displaying holes and
dents after 4 weeks, and the TPA detected by HPLC and SEM
further conﬁrmed degradation.
These results suggest that microalgae could be a potential
solution for plastic pollution treatment, especially in freshwater
and terrestrial settings. Using a marine microalga instead of
bacteria provides a sustainable option for plastic waste management
and oceanic ecosystem bioremediation. This paves the way for
developing bioreactors for PET bioremediation and closed-loop
recycling strategies.
4 Discussion and conclusion
The rapid accumulation of PET waste poses a global
environmental crisis, necessitating innovative and sustainable
solutions. This review systematically explores microbial-mediated
PET biodegradation as a transformative strategy for plastic waste
management, emphasizing advancements in enzyme engineering,
metabolic pathway optimization, and synthetic biology-driven
cell factory design. By integrating interdisciplinary approaches,
the ﬁeld would make signiﬁcant strides toward establishing a
circular PET economy.
While most current studies focus on lab-scale PET
degradation, this review highlights critical advances
supporting real-world applicability. Engineered consortia (e.g.,
Pseudomonas + Rhodococcus) degraded 89% of post-consumer PET
microplastics in simulated marine conditions (30◦C, 3.5% salinity),
which clearly demonstrates the environmental resilience. Industrial
scalability is also evidenced by thermostable LCC ICCG variants
achieving >90% PET depolymerization at 68 ◦C within 10 h, a
timeframe compatible with industrial hydrolysis reactors. Notably,
cost analyses suggest PET-to-PHA upcycling via engineered
P. putida could reach $1,200/ton proﬁtability, which is driven
by the reduced pretreatment and enzyme recycling. Challenges
also remain in maintaining strain robustness under nutrient-
limited, multipollutant scenarios, but modular chassis designs
(e.g., CRISPRi-mediated metabolic insulation) show promise for
ﬁeld adaptability. These ﬁndings underscore the feasibility of
transitioning cell factories from bioreactors to polluted ecosystems,
contingent on further pilot-scale validation of stability and
enzymatic turnover in heterogeneous waste streams.
In addition, novel biotechnological approaches are increasingly
facilitating PET degradation through engineered enzymatic
systems and optimized microbial chassis cells. Cell surface display
systems are capable of enhancing enzyme stability and reusability.
Immobilization strategies, such as MOF-based MC@CaZn-MOF ,
would improve PET ﬁlm degradation via spatially organized
enzyme complexes. Enzyme-substrate interface engineering

plays important roles in improving PET accessibility for high-
crystallinity substrates compared with the non-engineered
enzymes. Photosynthetic consortia oﬀer self-sustaining, solar-
driven degradation, though it currently exhibits low yields
compared to heterotrophic systems. CRISPR-edited microbes with
streamlined TPA pathways show promise for carbon-eﬃcient
upcycling but require further optimization.
As mentioned above, despite progress have been made in
the ﬁeld of microbial-mediated PET biodegradation, critical
challenges still remain. (1) Enzyme limitations, mainly caused by
thermostability and product inhibition (e.g., MHET accumulation),
might constrain the long-term eﬃciency. As highlighted in this
study, this could be partially addressed by computational tools like
ASR and machine learning-driven evolution. However, to meet
the needs for industrial application, signiﬁcant eﬀorts are still
required to enhance the stability and catalytic activity of PET-
degrading enzymes. (2) Optimization of the metabolic bottlenecks.
Especially, the competing carbon ﬂux (e.g., TPA vs. EG utilization)
and redox imbalances necessitate ﬁner metabolic tuning. This
challenge could be settled by dynamic regulation systems, especially
the promoter engineering (e.g., temperature-responsive promoters)
could optimize pathway coordination. (3) Industrial scalability is
also a critical aspect that requires key consideration. Low enzyme
production yields and high costs hinder large-scale adoption. In
order to solve this diﬃcult problem, as highlighted algal systems
(e.g., C. reinhardtii) and SSF might present eco-friendly alternatives
but require yield optimization. (4) Environmental adaptation is
another thorny issue that requires in-depth exploration during
the industrial application of PET biodegradation. Microbial
consortia face ecological instability in non-sterile environments.
Robust synthetic communities, such as the four-species Bacillus-
Pseudomonas-Rhodococcus consortium, must balance nutrient
competition and cross-feeding dynamics. While these studies
emphasize the beneﬁts of synthetic consortia, challenges such as
R. jostii RPET remain underexplored. For instance, the mentioned-
above four-species microbial consortium ( Bacillus-Pseudomonas-
Rhodococcus-P. putida) demonstrated improved PET degradation
but faced growth competition in nutrient-rich media, which
necessitate optimized culturing strategies (e.g., selective inorganic
salt media with dual carbon sources) to stabilize interactions and
suppress inhibitory eﬀects. Such cases highlight the delicate balance
required to manage nutrient competition, cross-feeding dynamics,
and metabolic incompatibilities.
In conclusion, this review underscores the transformative
potential of microbial and enzymatic strategies in addressing
PET pollution. By leveraging cutting-edge tools, from directed
evolution to synthetic consortia, researchers have demonstrated
eﬃcient PET depolymerization, monomer assimilation, and value-
added product synthesis. The integration of chemical pretreatment
(e.g., alkaline hydrolysis) with biological valorization exempliﬁes
a closed-loop paradigm, reducing reliance on fossil feedstocks.
Future eﬀorts must prioritize interdisciplinary collaboration
to overcome remaining technical barriers, optimize process
economics, and translate laboratory innovations into real-world
solutions. As the ﬁeld advances, the vision of a sustainable
circular plastic economy grows increasingly attainable, oﬀering
hope for mitigating one of the most pressing environmental
challenges of our time.
