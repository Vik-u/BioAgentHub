Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is a polyester plastic, which is widely used, notably as a material for single-use 
plastic bottles. Its accumulation in the environment now poses a global pollution threat. A number of enzymes 
are active on PET providing new options for industrial biorecycling of PET materials. The enzyme activity is 
strongly affected by the degree of PET crystallinity (X C ), and the X C is therefore a relevant factor to consider in 
enzyme catalyzed PET recycling. Here, we present a new experimental methodology, based on systematic thermal 
annealing for controlled preparation of PET disks having different X C , to allow systematic quantitative evaluation 
of the eﬃciency of PET degrading enzymes at different degrees of PET substrate crystallinity. We discuss the 
theory of PET crystallinity and compare PET crystallinity data measured by differential scanning calorimetry and 
attenuated Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. 
• This study introduces a simple method for controlling the crystallinity of PET samples via annealing in a heat 
block. 
• The present methodology is not limited to the analytical methods included in the methods details.

Method details 
Background: Polyethylene terephthalate as an enzyme substrate 
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is a synthetic polyester used in packaging materials and plastic 
bottles. PET accounts for ∼7% of global plastic usage [1] , and is a key contributor to the increasing 
plastic pollution [2] . The polymeric chains of PET consist of repeating units of ethylene glycol and 
terephthalic acid linked together by ester bonds. These polymer chains are either in an amorphous 
state (absence of long-range molecular order) or in a crystal structure (highly ordered) [3] . 
The degree of crystallinity (X C ) of a PET sample refers to the fraction of the total polymer chains 
being in the crystal structure state. The X C is a result of the PET process history, as crystallization is 
induced either thermally, at temperatures above the glass transition temperature T g (T g is 76 °C for 
amorphous PET), or during certain mechanical operations [4 , 5] . The amorphous fraction of PET is in 
fact comprised of two fractions, namely a rigid amorphous fraction (RAF) and a mobile amorphous 
fraction (MAF); the ratio of each is written as X RAF and X MAF , respectively . The RAF is present at 
the interface between the crystal and the amorphous regions as an immobilized phase caused by 
the crystallization, and the mobility of RAF is more restrained than the completely amorphous region 
MAF. The X RAF of a PET sample increases with the X C , while X MAF decreases [6 , 7] . 
Although PET is a synthetic polymer, recent data have shown that certain esterolytic enzymes 
(EC 3.1.1,x), including the PET hydrolase from the bacterium Ideonella sakaineses 201-F6, originally 
speciﬁed as a PETase (or IsPETase) [8] , now classiﬁed as EC 3.1.1.101, are capable of catalyzing 
hydrolysis of the ester bonds within PET. The activity of these enzymes are, however, limited on 
PET samples with a high X C [9–12] . X C of PET in water bottles ranges from 21–31% [13] making the 
signiﬁcance of X C on PET degrading enzyme activity of critical importance in biobased industrial PET 
recycling. 
Here we present the practical details and the theory behind an experimental methodology that 
we have developed for preparing PET samples of different degrees of crystallinity, X C , to allow 
systematic evaluation of the eﬃciency of PET degrading enzymes in response to the X C of PET [11] . 
We introduce annealing involving controlled heating and isothermal cold crystallization to control the 
X C of standardized PET sheets ( Fig. 1 ). 
Substrate preparation 
Preparation of PET material 
Amorphous or low crystalline PET ﬁlms or sheets (e.g. 1 mm thick amorphous PET cat. No. ES30301 
from Goodfellow Cambridge Ltd, Huntingdon, UK) are used as starting material to obtain PET materials 
having different X C via annealing and isothermal cold crystallization. The PET material is cut into 
uniform disks using a generic hole punch (Ø 6mm), prior to annealing. Although the starting materials 
are categorized as amorphous PET materials, it is important to note that the crystallinity of the PET 
ﬁlms and sheets differ, and observe that they are not completely amorphous (see Method Validation, 
below). 
Annealing and isothermal cold crystallization of PET 
The X C of the PET discs is systematically altered via annealing followed by cold crystallization 
as follows: A PET disk is transferred into a 2 mL Eppendorf tube and annealed in a heating block at

Fig. 1. Schematic representation of the method presented in this paper. (A) Amorphous PET material is cut into disks (Ø 6mm) 
using a hole punch. (B) The disks are transferred into a 2 mL Eppendorf tube, and annealed at 115 °C for a speciﬁed period of 
time to induce crystal formation via cold crystallization. The crystallization is quenched by cooling the annealed sample in ice 
water. The annealed PET samples are then analyzed by ATR-FTIR to quantify X MAF , and/or identify contaminants. The samples 
used for ATR-FTIR may be used directly for reaction or other analyses, including: (C1) DSC analysis for further characterization 
of substrate properties such as X C or (C2) enzymatic reactions for quantifying the effect of substrate X C for a speciﬁc PET 
degrading enzyme. 
115 °C for a deﬁned amount of time (minutes); up to three disks can be added per Eppendorf tube, still 
achieving the same crystallization result as is if only one disk is added at a time. The crystallization 
of the annealed PET sample is quenched by immediately transferring the Eppendorf tube into an 
ice water bath. It is kept on ice for at least 30 sec to ensure that the crystallized sample has been 
suﬃciently cooled. “Untreated” samples to be used for comparison should be annealed at 85 °C for 5 
min to remove the enthalpy relaxation caused by the aging of the polymer [14] . 
Substrate characterization 
Quantiﬁcation of X MAF by ATR-FTIR 
Attenuated total reﬂection Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) does not required 
any substrate preparation and can thus be performed directly on the PET disks after annealing. As it 
is a non-destructive method, the samples analyzed by ATR-FTIR can be used for further analysis, such 
as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) or enzymatic treatment. 
The peaks of interests described in this paper are at 973 cm −1 and 898 cm −1 .These two peaks 
are associated with the trans (973 cm −1 ) and gauche (898 cm −1 ) conformer of ethylene glycol [14 , 15] . 
While the gauche conformer is only associated with amorphous PET the trans conformer is present 
4 T.B. Thomsen, C.J. Hunt and A.S. Meyer / MethodsX 9 (2022) 101815 
in both the crystalline and amorphous regions [14] . The ratio of the absorbances at these two peaks 
(A 973 /A 898 ) is proportional with the X MAF of the sample. 
Quantiﬁcation of the X C and X MAF by DSC 
DSC can be used to quantify the X C of a sample annealed for a speciﬁc period of time, by 
analyzing a few samples (n = 3) from the batch. A temperature range from 20 °C to 270 °C is suﬃcient to 
determine the thermal features required to estimate X C and X MAF of PET samples. A constant heating 
rate of 10 °C min −1 is recommended, as some thermal features are dependent on the heating rate 
[9 , 11 , 16] . The X C of a PET sample, measured by DSC, is then calculated according to Eq. (1) : 
X C = 
/Delta1H m − /Delta1H cc 
/Delta1H 0 
m 
· 100% (1) 
Here, /Delta1H cc is the cold crystallization enthalpy (numerical value) of the sample, /Delta1H m is the heat 
of melting of the sample, and /Delta1H 0 
m is the heat of melting of a pure crystalline sample. According to 
literature /Delta1H 0 
m is 140 J g −1 [17] . 
The X MAF is calculated according to Eq. (2) : 
X MAF = 
/Delta1C P ( m ) 
/Delta1C P ( a ) 
(2) 
Where /2206C P(m) is the change in heat capacity of the sample at T g and /2206C P(a) is the change in heat 
capacity at T g of a completely amorphous sample. By extrapolation from a linear regression curve 
of measured /2206C P(m) values and X C of PET disk samples we have previously estimated /2206C P(a) of an 
amorphous PET disk sample to be approximately 0.47 J g −1 K −1 [11] . 
Enzyme assay 
The effect of the increased substrate crystallinity on the particular enzyme activity is evaluated on 
PET disks of different X C by measuring the concentration of soluble products formed during enzymatic 
reaction. Products are measured in terms of bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-terephthalic acid (BHET) equivalents 
via absorbance measurements of the reaction at 240 nm [18] . The rate of the product formation is 
then plotted against X C of the PET disks used. 
The enzyme reactions are performed in Eppendorf tubes using 1 disk and a reaction volume of 1 
mL in buffer. During the enzymatic treatment, 10μL of the reaction is sampled at various time points. 
The concentration of soluble product should be normalized with respect to the starting volume V 0 
according to Eq. (3). 
C i = 
C s,i ∗ V i + 
∑ n 
i −1 (C s,n ∗ V s,n ) 
V 0 
(3) 
Where C i and V i is the normalized concentration of soluble products and the reaction volume 
at time point i . C s,i , C s,n , and V s,n is the measured concentration of soluble products in the sample 
measured at time point i or n and the sampling volume at time point n . 
The product release rate on each PET sample is then calculated from the linear regions of the 
progress curves. The rate data are then plotted against the X C or X MAF quantiﬁed by either DSC or 
ATR-FTIR. 
Method validation (Case study) 
Materials and instrumentation 
PET material 
1 mm thick amorphous PET sheets (Cat. No. ES303010) denoted as PET-S. 250 μm thick amorphous 
PET ﬁlm (Cat. No. ES301445) denoted as PET-F, and semi-crystalline PET particles, Ø< 300μm (Cat. No. 
ES306031), denoted as PET-P were all from Goodfellow (Cambridge Ltd, Huntingdon, UK). The PET-P 
particles were cast into an amorphous PET sheet by melting 0.5 g of particles in an aluminum dish 
T.B. Thomsen, C.J. Hunt and A.S. Meyer / MethodsX 9 (2022) 101815 5 
(Ø 2.6 cm) for 1 min at 270 °C and subsequent quenching in ice water. These latter samples will be 
denoted as PET-C. Starting crystallinity was measured to be: PET-S: 9.1 ± 1.3%, PET-F: 1.3 ± 0.4%, 
PET-P: 37.5 ± 0.7%. 
Isothermal crystallization 
PET-S, PET-F, and PET-C were all cut into disks using a generic hole punch (Ø 6mm). Samples were 
annealed at 115 °C for 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15 min (PET-S, PET-F), and for 30 min (PET-S, PET-F, and PET- 
C) in a heating block. At the speciﬁc time points the samples were quenched (cold crystallized), by 
transferring the annealed samples into ice water for 30 sec. “Untreated” PET samples were annealed 
at 85 °C for 5 min, and subsequently quenched in ice water for 30 sec. 
ATR- FTIR analysis 
ATR-FTIR was performed directly on the PET disks (n = 3) using a Spectrum 100 FTIR spectrometer 
(PerkinElmer, MA, USA). Samples were monitored from 40 0 0 to 650 cm −1 with a resolution of 4 cm −1 . 
Each spectrum consisted of an average of 4 scans. 
DSC analysis 
The X C of the PET samples was quantiﬁed using DSC measurements (n = 3) on a Pyris 1 Calorimeter 
(Perkin Elmer, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA). A constant heating rate of 10 °C min −1 was applied on 
samples weighing 8.5 ± 0.5 mg for PET-P and PET-S or 6.5 ± 0.5 mg for PET-F between temperatures 
of 20 °C and 270 °C. X C and X MAF was calculated according to Eqs. (1) and (2) , respectively. 
Enzymes 
LCC ICCG was expressed recombinantly in E. coli Shuﬄe T7 and puriﬁed as described in 
[11] (Expression also works inE. coli BL21 (DE3) cells). 
Enzyme activity assay 
1 disk of PET was treated with 150 nM LCC ICCG in 1 mL 0.5M glycine-NaOH buffer pH 9 at 70 °C 
during shaking in a thermomixer (Eppendorf, Hamburg, Germany) for up to 8 h. 10 μL were sampled 
at speciﬁc time points during the reaction. The product formation, at the time points, was quantiﬁed 
by measuring the absorbance at 240 nm using a Synergy HT TM plate reader (BioTek, Winooski, 
Vermont, United States) as described in [18] . A sample containing 32.6 mg/mL PET-P, corresponding 
to the average weight of a PET-S disk, was included as a benchmark and assayed under the same 
conditions as PET-S. All reactions were performed in triplicate. 
Results validation 
The increase in X C caused by the annealing followed the characteristic Avrami equation ( Fig. 2 A), 
which is associated with crystal growth during annealing [19 , 20] and the X C data obtained per 
annealing time were higher for the PET-S (sheet) that the PET-F (ﬁlm) samples ( Fig. 2 A). 
As a supplement to the DSC measurements the ATR-FTIR spectra of the untreated PET samples 
and extensively annealed PET samples (heated for 30 min at 115 °C), respectively, were obtained for 
the PET-C, PET-F, and PET-S. From the ATR-FTIR spectra, it was observed that the peak at 973 cm −1 
increased upon annealing while the absorbance at 898 cm −1 decreased for both the PET-S and the 
PET-C samples. A non-linear relationship was observed between the X C and the A 973 /A 898 ratio of 
PET-S (linear model r 2 = 0.96) ( Fig. 2 C), but a linear correlation, r 2 = 0.99, was observed between the 
X MAF and A 973 /A 898 ratio ( Fig. 2 D). These observations are in agreement with the gauche conformation 
only being present in X MAF . For PET-S, ATR-FTIR can thereby be used as a non-destructive method to 
directly quantify the X MAF of thermally annealed samples before enzymatic treatment. 
It is important to note that no changes were observed on the ATR-FTIR spectrum of the PET- 
F samples. Moreover, both the untreated and annealed PET-F samples produced a broad peak with 
absorbance maximum at 955 cm −1 . We attribute these data to the possible presence of impurities in 
the original PET ﬁlm. For this reason, PET-S is recommended as a substrate for the method presented 
here for quantiﬁcation of the effect of X C on the product release rate of PET degrading enzymes.

only as an aid for the eye. (D) Linear correlation between the X MAF measured by DSC and the ATR-FTIR ratio A 973 /A 898 . 
From the enzymatic reaction progress curves it was evident that the product release rate catalyzed 
by LCC ICCG on the untreated sample (X C = 8.2%) was constant throughout the 8 h of the enzymatic 
treatment ( Fig. 3 A). A lag phase was evident for the samples with higher X C [11] . The substrate 
X C , induced by annealing affected the length of the observed lag phases, which increased with an 
increasing substrate crystallinity. The samples with a low X C (9.3 and 13.8%) thus also displayed lag 
phases, although the product release rate did not differ once a steady-state reaction rate had been 
reached. Once a steady-state was reached for the samples with 9.3 or 13.8% X C (determined by the 
linear region of the progress curves displayed in Fig. 3 A), it was observed that the product release 
rate of these samples had reached the same level as the untreated sample. In contrast, the samples 
with a X C of 18.8 % or higher displayed signiﬁcantly lower product release rates. 
The correlation between the product release rate and the X C followed a sigmoidal trend ( Fig. 3 B). 
This indicates that the negative effect on the LCC ICCG catalyzed product release rate caused by 
increasing substrate crystallinity, reached a critical point at a X C between 13.8 and 18.8%, as the 
reaction rate decreased ∼10 fold within this range. A similar observation was made for the Ideonella 
sakaiensis PETase, IsPETase, using PET-F samples crystallized via non-isothermal crystallization from 
melt [10] .

Important considerations 
The annealing temperature affects the crystallization rates, X C at saturation/metastable state, and 
the crystal thickness [7] . The annealing temperature of 115 °C was chosen as X C saturation was 
reached within a reasonable amount of time [11] . The enzyme response data ( Fig. 3 B) underline that 
it is particularly important to evaluate the reaction rates based on progress curves rather than on 
end-point measurements. Although PET hydrolase activity as EC 3.1.1.101 has now been deﬁned as 
producing mono(2-hydroxyethy) terephthalate (MHET) and (ethylene terephthalate) n-1 from (ethylene 
terephthalate) n ( www.BRENDA-enzymes.org ), it is known that many PET degrading (poly)esterases, 
including the I. sakaiensis PETase, produce some BHET in addition to MHET [18 , 21] measureable by 
HPLC. In the present method, we employed direct spectrophotometry of supernatant samples at 240 
nm, principally as described in [18] . This quantiﬁcation of the products as BHET eq is thus mainly a 
method for enzyme screening or for assessing e.g. the signiﬁcance of systematic substrate alterations. 
A sample containing 32.6 mg of PET-P, corresponding to the average mass of a PET-S disk, was 
included as a benchmark. The X C of PET-P was very high (37.5 ± 0.7 %), while the total surface area 
of the PET-P sample was several fold larger than that of a PET-S disc (according to our calculations 
minimum 6 times larger considering a particle diameter of 300 μm of each PET-P particle). During 
the initial 1.5 h of incubation, the initial product release rate on the PET-P was signiﬁcantly higher 
than the low crystalline PET-S sample. After this point (after an extent of reaction of approximately 
4%) the product release rate decreased 14 fold, from 7 ± 0.9 mM BHET eq. h −1 to 0.5 ± 0.03 mM 
BHET eq. h −1 . This observed leveling off with time agrees with other studies and appears to be a 
common trait of enzymatic PET degradation [9 , 11 , 12] . Based on recording a large variation in the 
enzymatic degradability of PET chips from different parts of postconsumer packaging material, it has 
been suggested [9] , that differences in degradability may be due to differences in the distribution 
of the crystalline microstructures within heterogeneous PET samples. Our data on PET-P versus PET- 
S ( Fig. 3 ) agree with this interpretation. Taken together, the results underline the importance of 
annealing the PET disks in a controlled manner to examine the signiﬁcance of crystallinity on PET 
hydrolase degradation rates. 
Conclusion 
In this study, we present a new methodology used to quantitatively evaluate the inﬂuence of 
PET substrate crystallinity, X C , on the action of PET degrading enzymes. The method involves the 
8 T.B. Thomsen, C.J. Hunt and A.S. Meyer / MethodsX 9 (2022) 101815 
preparation of PET samples having different levels X C , by annealing PET samples above their T g using 
commercially available PET sheets as starting material. 
As a validation of the methodology the effect of the X C , on the product release rate of the gold 
standard thermostable PET-hydrolyzing enzyme LCC ICCG was investigated. The ﬁndings showed that 
the enzymatic rate was heavily dependent on the X C . Especially between a X C of 13.8 and 18.8%, at 
which the reaction rate decreased ∼10 fold. Furthermore, it was observed that the product release 
rates were not constant during the reaction using PET at a X C > 8.2%. The data thus emphasize the 
importance of using progress curves rather than end-point measures when evaluating the catalytic 
eﬃciency of PET degrading enzymes on PET, and notably on PET substrate samples of different X C . 
It is suggested that the methodology presented in this paper is used as a standardized 
methodology for addressing the inﬂuence of X C on PET degrading enzymes to allow a direct 
comparison between different studies. 
Perspectives 
As a ﬁnal remark, it is important to state that this methodology is not limited to the 
characterization of the inﬂuence of X C on the enzyme activity. An alternate annealing temperature 
(above T g ) may be used. This will, however, result in different crystallization rates, X C at 
saturation/metastable state, and crystal thickness. The thermally annealed PET samples may also be 
used in other enzyme assays, which are addressing different properties than the product release rate.
