ABSTRACT Global plastic pollution in oceans and estuaries is increasing rapidly , and it 
is well known that bacteria colonize plastic particles of all sizes. Vibrio spp. are frequently 
found as part of the plastisphere. We recently showed that Vibrio gazogenes DSM 21264 
harbors a promiscuous esterase designated PET6. We now provide evidence that the 
pet6 gene is expressed under a wide range of environmental conditions in its native 
host. However, in PET- and PE-grown biofilms, the pet6 gene expression was not affected 
by the type of surface. The pet6 transcription was sufficient to allow enzyme produc­
tion and release of µM amounts of mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) and 
terephthalic acid (TPA) already after 24 hours of incubation on the PET foil. Notably, 
the highest pet6 gene transcription was observed in planktonic lifestyle in the presence 
of bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) , one of the primary degradation products 
of PET. BHET was further hydrolyzed by PET6 and UlaG, a lactonase that had not been 
known to be involved in BHET degradation. Elevated concentrations of BHET affected 
the major signaling circuits involved in bacterial quorum sensing (QS), c-di-GMP , and 
cAMP-CRP signaling. This resulted in failure to form biofilms, synthesis of the red pigment 
prodigiosin, and altered colony morphologies. While BHET had a very wide impact, 
TPA interfered mainly with the bacterial QS by attenuating the expression of the CAI-I 
autoinducer synthase gene. These observations imply a potential role of BHET and TPA as 
nutritional signals in Vibrio gazogenes and that may affect its growth and survival in the 
plastisphere.
IMPORTANCE This study provides the first evidence that Vibrio gazogenes  DSM 21264 
secretes an active polyethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrolase and degrades the polymer 
using PET6 when growing in biofilms on foils and microplastic particles. The study 
further provides evidence that the primary PET degradation products bis(2-hydroxyethyl) 
terephthalate (BHET) and terephthalic acid (TPA) may have a profound impact on the 
global QS, c-di-GMP , and cAMP-CRP signaling of V. gazogenes  and its capability to 
colonize plastic particles in the marine environment.

lobal plastic pollution has reached an alarming and unprecedented level in the 
recent decade. Recently, it was estimated that a minimum of 8–10 million tons 
of plastic is entering the oceans annually ( 1–5). While most of the plastic enters the 
environment as larger floating fragments, weathering results in the production of smaller 
particles (micro-, nano-, and pico-plastics) with sizes less than 5 mm in diameter ( 6, 7).

These particles and the additives contained in them are believed to have a negative 
impact on all ecological niches and their biodiversity ( 8, 9). Ultimately, they will also 
affect human health and wellbeing (10).
The majority of the fossil fuel -based and synthetic polymers which end up in 
the environment are polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), polyvinylchloride (PVC), 
polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyurethane (PUR), polystyrene (PS) , and polyamide 
(PA) only, being produced at lower quantities ( 11). While for most of these polymers 
no enzymes and microorganisms are known to degrade them , the degradation of PET 
is well understood ( https://www.pazy.eu) (12). PET is degraded by promiscuous and 
secreted esterases, lipases , or cutinases that all have broad substrate specificity and are 
members of the E.C. classes 3.1.1.- (11, 13, 14). In addition to these studies, recently, much 
effort has been made to analyze and characterize the phylogenetic makeup of micro­
bial communities associated with plastic particles found in the marine environment. 
The microorganisms colonizing plastic particles (i.e., the plastic microbiota) have been 
termed “plastisphere” ( 15–18). These studies indicate that growth on and the initial 
colonization of plastic surfaces depends on the chemical and the physical properties of 
the various polymers. Thereby, the surface charge, roughness, and the different chemical 
compositions of additives play key roles during the attachment and growth of the plastic 
colonizing microbiota (16, 19).
Notably, simple colonization does not imply any biodegradation ( 6). The microbial 
communities observed are highly diverse in their phylogeny , and bacteria affiliated 
with the genus Vibrio are often observed on plastic particles ( 18, 20–24). Vibrio species 
are ubiquitously occurring gram-negative bacteria that are mainly found in marine 
environments where they are considered to be key players in carbon and nitrogen 
cycling (25, 26). There are more than 100 known Vibrio species, of which few are either 
human or fish pathogens (e.g., Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus, Vibrio alginolyti­
cus, and Vibrio vulnificus (27–29).
Recently, we have shown that the marine organism V. gazogenes DSM 21264 (from 
here on DSM 21264) harbors a gene encoding a promiscuous esterase designated 
PET6 in its 4.6 Mbp genome ( 30, 31). DSM 21264 (synonym PB1, ATCC 29988 ) is a 
gram-negative and nonpathogenic bacterium. It was isolated from sulfide-containing 
mud collected from a saltwater marsh and produces prodigiosin, a red pigment ( 32). The 
species is globally occurring and typically found in estuaries. The pet6 gene is encoded 
by ORF AAC977_05355. The heterologously expressed protein hydrolyzes amorphous 
PET and other substrates including short -chain fatty acid esters ( 30, 31), and its activity 
is salt-dependent. PET hydrolysis catalyzed by recombinant PET6 is, however, rather low 
compared to other known enzymes used in industrial processes like the well-character­
ized IsPETase or LCC (31). While much information was gathered on the enzyme structure 
and biochemical function of PETases, only a few studies focused on the expression of 
the enzyme within the native host. Ideonella sakaiensis  is among the only organisms 
for which the PET metabolism is well understood ( 33). With respect to DSM 21264 , it 
was not known under which conditions the pet6 gene is transcribed in its native host 
and if the native enzyme would result in PET degradation in the environment. Within 
this manuscript , we provide the first evidence that the pet6 gene is transcribed at low 
levels under various environmental conditions. The pet6 gene expression is, however, not 
affected by the presence of PET, PE foil, or PET powder.
Instead, BHET, a primary PET degradation product, affects pet6 transcription at mM 
concentrations. Further, our data imply that BHET is a nutritional signal affecting the 
c-di-GMP , the cAMP-CRP, and QS-dependent signaling pathways in DSM 21264. These 
three signaling pathways are essential to lifestyle transitions from motility, attaching to a 
surface, and forming biofilms in the plastisphere.

RESULTS
DSM 21264 forms patchy biofilms on PE and PET independent from the 
surface and releases micromolar concentrations of MHET and TPA
Since we had earlier shown that DSM 21264 produces a PET-active hydrolase, designa­
ted PET6 ( 30, 31), we wanted to know if the organism forms biofilms on PET foil and 
actively degrades PET. Further, we asked if the pet6 gene is expressed at significant levels. 
Therefore, we inoculated DSM 21264 in artificial seawater medium (ASWM) with PET or 
PE foil for biofilm formation and potential degradation. Since no PE-degradative genes 
have been reported in gram-negative bacteria , PE foil was used as a control. In these 
biofilm experiments , cells attached in general at very low frequencies , and only thin 
single-cell layer biofilms were formed after 10 and 180 days ( Fig. 1; Fig. S1). Therefore, 
we used ASWM supplemented with tryptone and yeast extract 1% (wt/vol) in further 
tests to promote growth and biofilm formation. Under these conditions , DSM 21264 
attached within few hours and formed patchy biofilms on both plastic surfaces, whereby 
the biofilms formed on PE were less patchy than those on PET (Fig. 1). Biofilms formed on 
PE and PET had an average thickness of 2–3 μm, equaling one cell layer (Fig. 1).
SEM images showed that the cells on PET and PE were interconnected by fiber- and 
net-like structures with a length of 4–10 μm. However, the net-like structures were more 
prominent on PE surfaces (Fig. 1). Additional tests with air plasma-treated PET and PE foil 
were conducted (34). Air plasma treatment leads to the formation of oxygen functional­
ities and thus an increase in surface polarity. It typically gives a potential degradative 
enzyme better access to the polymer fibers ( 35). However, in these tests , only minor 
differences were observed with respect to biofilm formation ( Fig. 1 ; Fig. S1 ). Notably, 
FIG 1 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) ( A, D) and confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images ( B, C, E, F ) of V. gazogenes DSM 21246 biofilms grown 
on PET and PE foil. SEM images and CLSM images (A), ( B), and (D); ( E) show first attachment of cells after 8 hours of incubation in the ASW medium at 22°C of 
incubation on PET foil (A) and (B) and PE foil (D) and (E). CLSM images (C) and (F) show biofilm formation of DSM 21264 on PET foil (C) and PE foil (F) after 24 hours 
of incubation. Cells were stained using LIVE/DEAD stain.

when we grew DSM 21264 on PET foil or powder, we detected micromolar amounts of 
BHET, MHET, and TPA in the biofilm and culture supernatants already after 24 hours ( Fig. 
2).
Transcriptome analysis identifies keys to PET6 gene expression
Based on the above-made observations, we further asked if the pet6 gene 
(AAC977_05355) was expressed and if surface attachment to PET or PE resulted in 
major transcriptional changes. To address these questions, we mainly used transcriptome 
studies with the goal of obtaining insight into the overall gene expression pattern 
of DSM 21264 in response to PET or other substrates during life in biofilms and 
planktonic cultures. In total , we analyzed 14 different environmental parameters and/or 
carbon sources. Each experiment was repeated three times , resulting in 42 RNAseq data 
sets that have been submitted to the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA). They are 
publicly available under accession PRJEB80907. Obtained reads were mapped against 
the genome of DSM 21264. For this purpose, we established a high-quality genome 
sequence of DSM 21264 that encompasses two chromosomes coding for 4,159 genes. 
Chromosome 1 ( CP151640) codes for 3,121 genes and chromosome 2 ( CP151641) for 
1,038 genes. The newly established genome sequence is available under accession 
numbers CP151640 and CP151641 at NCBI/GenBank. An overview of the data sets 
reads obtained, the percentage of reads mapped to the genome , and other parameters 
together with the level of pet6 gene expression is given in Table S2; Fig. 3.
PET6 is weakly expressed in biofilms grown on PET and PE foils
When we compared PET-grown biofilms versus PE-grown biofilms, the expression of pet6 
was low and ranked around 25% of the weakest transcribed genes. Fig. 3 summarizes the 
level of expression of pet6 under the biofilm conditions tested and in relation to the 
genome-wide expression of all genes. Plasma treatment of the PET or PE foil had no 
FIG 2 PET degradation products observed in supernatants of V. gazogenes DSM 21264 biofilms grown on PET foil (non-treated), UV-treated foil, and PET powder. 
V. gazogenes DSM 21264 was grown in the ASW medium with reduced carbon source. Supernatants were collected after 1, 3 , and 5 days, and the degradation 
products were measured using UHPLC and as described in the Material and Methods section. Data were normalized and corrected to E. coli DH5α growing on 
PET foil and powder. Data are expressed as mean values of three independent replications, and bars represent the standard deviations.

significant impact on the low level of pet6 gene expression ( Table S1 ; Fig. 3 ). This 
observation is in line with the slow degradation of the polymer in biofilm cultures, as 
described above ( Fig. 2 ). In addition, we noticed that in all biofilm experiments , the 
transcription of ompU was among the highest transcribed genes. OmpU is an outer 
membrane protein that has for V. cholerae been described to be important for biofilm 
formation (36), implying that OmpU possibly is involved in surface colonization. Further­
more, only four genes were differentially expressed in all biofilm studies ( Table S1 and 
S3). Highest log2-fold changes were detected for a glutathione peroxidase and an alkyl 
hydroxide peroxidase, both involved in hydrogen peroxide scavenging ( 37). In addition, 
the adhE gene, which is involved in ethylene glycol (EG) metabolism , was significantly 
upregulated in PET biofilms but not in PE-grown biofilms (Table S1). To further verify the 
increased expression of adhE, a reporter fusion was constructed fusing the promoter 
with the amcyan gene in pBBR1-MCS-1 and mobilized into DSM 21264 ( Table 1). Using 
the P_adhE::amcyan transcriptional reporter gene fusion in DSM 21264 , we were able to 
verify that adhE was twofold upregulated in the presence of 5 mM EG (Fig. S5).
Since PET and PE are no natural substrates for bacteria, we further asked if other 
natural polymers would stimulate pet6 gene expression. Therefore, we added alginate, 
chitin, and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) (1% wt/vol) to planktonic cultures and assayed 
the transcriptomes after 24 hours of aerobic growth. As expected in the planktonic 
cultures, a largely different pattern of gene transcription was observed compared to 
the biofilm conditions ( Table S1; Fig. 4 to 6 ; Fig. S2). Since under all tested conditions a 
number of reads were mapped to the pet6 gene, it appears to be constitutively expressed 
(Fig. 3 ). In general, the transcription level of pet6 was low and close to 0.4% of the 
transcription observed for rpoD (Table S2). In summary, the data imply that pet6 gene 
expression is not strongly activated by any of the added natural polymers or by PET 
powder (1% wt/vol) containing cultures. However, the expression was significantly higher 
in the planktonic cultures compared to the biofilm cultures (Fig. 3).

Pet6 and ulaG transcription are induced by BHET in DSM 21264
Since PET6 hydrolyzes PET, we further asked if DSM 21264 would be able to metabolize 
BHET and use it as a sole carbon and energy source, and if it would affect pet6 gene 
expression. To address these questions , additional experiments in liquid media were 
performed challenging DSM 21264 with BHET at concentrations of 0.5, 5.0 , and 30 mM. 
The growth of the strain was not affected by lower BHET concentrations (0.5 mM and 
5.0 mM) after 24 h of incubation ( Fig. S8). Since higher concentrations of BHET precip­
itate, measurement of OD 600 was not valid. Testing 30 mM of BHET on agar plates 
determined less colony formation than other tested concentrations, implying reduced 
growth ( Fig. S6 ). The overall gene expression profile using RNAseq was tested for the 
respective BHET concentrations. As controls , we incubated DSM 21264 in the presence 
of 1.0 mM TPA, DMSO (0.5% vol/vol) , and PET powder (1% wt/vol) in liquid cultures. 
Table S2 summarizes the data obtained for all RNAseq experiments. The volcano plots 
highlight major changes in gene expression ( Fig. S2 ). A detailed analysis identified a 
large number of genes and operons differentially regulated (>log2-fold change of 2) in 
the presence of the different BHET concentrations , clearly indicating that DSM 21264 
senses and adapts its metabolism to the presence of BHET ( Table S1; Fig. 4 to 6 ). High 
concentrations (5.0 and 30 mM) of BHET had the most pronounced effects on the overall 
gene expression levels in DSM 21264 with >230 upregulated and >100 downregulated 
genes in the presence of 5.0 mM and >830 upregulated and >550 downregulated genes 
in the presence of 30 mM BHET compared to the DMSO or the TPA controls ( Fig. S7 ). 
Our data imply that BHET is most likely initially metabolized by PET6 , releasing MHET 
as the primary degradation product of BHET. This is in line with an almost fivefold 
(log2-fold change) increased transcription level of pet6 (AAC977_05355) at 5 mM BHET

and 1.8-fold increase at 30 mM. Surprisingly, the RNAseq data indicated that UlaG, a 
predicted metallo-ß-lactamase, is also involved in BHET metabolism. In the presence of 
30 mM BHET, ulaG was most strongly transcribed with a 7.9-fold upregulation compared 
to the control. To further verify this novel role of UlaG, we expressed it in E. coli T7 SHuffle 
and used the recombinant protein to hydrolyze BHET. In these tests , the promiscuous 
enzyme was able to cleave BHET at slow but significant rates ( Fig. S3). Further UHPLC 
measurement confirmed that MHET is the main and initial degradation product of DSM 
21,264 cells grown on BHET (Fig. S4). While MHET is converted to EG and TPA, DSM 21264 
was neither able to grow on TPA and EG as the sole carbon and energy source nor on 
BHET. It does not encode any mono- and dioxygenases involved in aromatic ring 
cleavage.
BHET and TPA affect the central circuits involved in c-di-GMP , cAMP-CRP, and 
QS signaling in DSM 21264
During the above-described growth experiments using BHET as a substrate, we 
noticed major phenotypic changes in DSM 21264 affecting colony morphology, biofilm 
formation, prodigiosin biosynthesis, and others (Fig. S6).
BHET altered colony morphology already at rather low concentrations (0.5 mM). 
Colonies were less structured and had smooth edges. Higher concentrations of BHET 
resulted in the disappearance of the red pigment prodigiosin. Biofilm formation was 
disturbed at 0.5 mM, and no solid biofilms were formed at 10 mM BHET present in the 
medium (Fig. S6).
These phenotypic observations implied a larger impact of BHET on the metabolism 
and main regulatory circuits of DSM 21264 in planktonic cultures. To further elucidate 
these effects, we analyzed our transcriptomic data with respect to the influence of BHET 
on regulatory pathways linked to QS, cAMP-CRP signaling, and c-di-GMP signaling. These 
pathways were chosen as they are known to have a wider impact on biofilm formation, 
motility, secretion, secondary metabolite production, and others.
Most notably, 30 mM BHET strongly affected the transcription of genes essential 
for c-di-GMP biosynthesis. The signal c-di-GMP is synthesized by diguanylate cyclases 
degraded by phosphodiesterases. DSM 21264 harbors at least 16 possible c-di-GMP 
cyclases/phosphodiesterases in its genome. The majority of the diguanylate cyclases 
were strongly downregulated in their transcription in the presence of high concentra­
tions of BHET, while they were strongly upregulated in the presence of low concentra­
tions of BHET or other carbon sources ( Fig. 4 ). The most strongly attenuated genes 
coding for diguanylate cyclases were cdgB, C, I, J, and M (log2-fold change < –4.5). On the 
contrary, cdgG and acgB were strongly upregulated in the presence of increased BHET 
concentrations (log2-fold change 3.5 and 5) (Fig. 4).
Further, we observed that BHET affected quorum sensing (QS) processes. In this 
context, transcription of the master QS regulator aphA was almost not detectable at 
30 mM BHET, while it was well expressed at 0.5 and 5.0 mM BHET or in the presence 
of TPA in planktonic cultures ( Fig. 5 ). HapR was also only weakly transcribed in the 
presence of 30 mM BHET. While it is well known that AphA and HapR are usually 
transcribed at opposite levels, no differences in transcription levels were visible neither
in the presence of lower concentrations of BHET nor in the presence of TPA. These 
differences in expression were, however, clearly visible in all the biofilm experiments and 
in the planktonic cultures supplemented with natural polymers (Fig. 5).
Furthermore, TPA negatively affected the transcription of the autoinducer synthase 
gene cqsA, which is involved in the cholera autoinducer I biosynthesis (CAI-I) ( Table S1; 
Fig. 5). Further, our data showed that the DSM 21264 autoinducer (AI) -I synthase, LuxM , 
and the cognate sensor LuxN , as well as the genes coding for the AI-2 synthase, luxS, 
the periplasmatic binding protein, LuxP , and the sensor kinase LuxQ were significantly 
affected in their transcription levels at 30 mM BHET (Fig. 5).

July 2025  Volume 13  Issue 7 10.1128/spectrum.00181-25 8
Finally, our data implied that BHET interfered with cAMP-CRP signaling. The catabolite 
activator protein transcription was almost completely turned off in the presence of 
30 mM BHET (Fig. 6).
Besides the direct impact of 30 mM BHET on the above-mentioned regulatory circuits, 
30 mM BHET strongly attenuated the transcription of motility genes, hapA, aspE, and 
ompU. On the contrary, the expressions of ulaG, ulaR , aphC, aphF, and the prodigiosin 
operon were strongly upregulated (Fig. 6).
Interestingly, among the highest upregulated genes in the samples supplemen­
ted with 30 mM BHET , several phage -related genes were observed. In total, DSM

3, designated VGPH03, AAC977_09080 – AAC977_09210), which can be grouped into 
the class of Caudoviricetes. VGPH01 and VGPH02 are encoded on the smaller chromo­
some CP151641, whereas VGPH03 is part of the larger chromosome CP151640. All three 
phages were transcribed under biofilm conditions. In contrast, their transcription was 
generally low in planktonic cultures. However, in planktonic cultures, 30 mM BHET 
resulted in strong transcription of the gene clusters coding for VGPH01 and VGPH02 
(Table S4; Fig. 6).
In summary , our data imply that BHET and TPA may have a wider effect on the 
metabolism of DSM 21264 and interfere with the interconnected pathways involved in 
c-di-GMP , QS, and cAMP-CRP signaling.
DISCUSSION
Today, 125 PET-active enzymes are known , and most of these enzymes have been 
characterized very well with respect to their structures, functions , and catalytic activities 
on the synthetic polymer. These enzymes are generally secreted and promiscuous 
hydrolases belonging to the E.C. 3.1.-. ( 6, 11–14). However, only very few studies have 
analyzed the growth of bacteria on the PET foil using global RNAseq approaches ( 40–42). 
Despite these first studies, it is not clear if bacteria differentiate between the different 
types of synthetic polymers either as a surface to attach to or as a potential substrate for 
breakdown.
Our data suggest that only very few genes are differentially regulated when DSM 
21264 is grown on PET versus the non-biodegradable PE, implying that most likely DSM 
21264 is not able to differentiate between these two polymers. Also, the treatment with 
plasma did not affect this response. Interestingly, our data identified ompU as one of 
the most strongly transcribed genes when grown in biofilms (Table 2). OmpU is an outer 
membrane protein known to be an important adherence factor in Vibrio cholerae and an 
essential biofilm matrix assembly protein ( 36). Based on these earlier findings, it is likely 
that the DSM 21264 OmpU plays a major role in biofilm formation on plastic surfaces and 
life in the plastisphere.
Only a few Vibrio species harbor PET6 homologs , but all of them share a very 
conserved core genome and have common regulatory networks ( 31, 43, 44). Within 
this setting, our data imply that pet6 is expressed at low levels under most environmental 
conditions (Fig. 3), and increasing BHET concentrations affected the transcription of the 
gene.
Besides these observations , our study has further revealed that UlaG is involved in 
BHET metabolism. Previous work has already demonstrated that UlaG is a promiscuous 
metallo-beta-lactamase with a wide range of functions in bacteria and archaea ( 45, 46). 
We observed a strongly increased transcription of ulaG in the presence of high BHET 
concentrations. Additional BHET degradation assays confirmed this novel functional role 
of UlaG ( Fig. S3 ; Fig. 7 ). Ideonella sakaiensis  is the only organism for which the whole 
degradation pathway of PET is mostly understood. PET is degraded into MHET and 
EG and further transformed by the IsMHETase into TPA and EG. EG is then oxidized 
by an alcohol dehydrogenase to glycolaldehyde (GAD) and further metabolized by the 
aldehyde dehydrogenase to glycolic acid (GA) ( 47). Similar to the EG metabolism of 
I. sakaiensis , our data support the notion that adhE in DSM 21264 is involved in the 
metabolism of EG. This observation was supported by both RNAseq and experimental 
data ( Fig. S5). Since adhE is transcribed at higher levels in PET biofilms, it is likely that 
this increase is caused already by the degradation of the polymer and the parallel BHET 
release (Fig. 7).
Additionally, the data from our study suggest that BHET and TPA are nutritional 
signals affecting QS, c-di-GMP , and cAMP signaling at micromolar concentrations ( Table 
S1; Fig. 4 to 6). This hypothesis is based on 42 transcriptomic data sets of DSM 21264 that 
have given us insights into the response of this bacterium when challenged with PET, 
other natural polymers, BHET , and TPA. Because of the important role of Vibrio spp. in 
pathogenicity, regulatory networks have been well studied in this genus ( 48–50). These

networks are known to be involved in surface attachment, biofilm formation, infection, 
toxin and secondary metabolite production, phage assembly , and others. Biofilm 
formation in Vibrio spp. is controlled by quorum sensing (QS), an integrated and highly 
complex network of multiple transcriptional regulators (e.g., VpsR, VpsT, HapR, H-NS, and 
AphA). The c-di-GMP signaling influences the planktonic-to-biofilm transition. In 
addition, cAMP-CRP signaling represses biofilm formation in Vibrio spp. (49, 50).
In this study, we showed that many of the above-mentioned regulatory circuits and 
their key regulators in DSM 21264 were affected by BHET and in part by TPA in planktonic 
cultures (Fig. 4 to 6). For instance, essential components of the QS signaling , like the low-
cell density regulator, AphA, and the high-cell density regulator, HapR, were strongly 
attenuated by high concentrations of BHET. Like AphA and HapR, the autoinducer-I and 2 
synthase genes ( luxM and luxS), the cognate sensor genes ( luxN and luxQ), and the 
transcription of the periplasmic binding protein (LuxP) were significantly affected in their 
transcription levels by 30 mM BHET (Fig. 5). QS thereupon regulates the c-di-GMP level in 
the cell. The major signal c-di-GMP is produced by diguanylate cyclases and degraded by 
specific phosphodiesterases that are directly regulated by HapR ( 50, 51). DSM 21264 has 
a very similar set of c-di-GMP cyclases and phosphodiesterases compared to V. cholerae 
or other well -studied Vibrio species. Many of the cyclase genes were differentially 
regulated at higher concentrations of BHET (Table S1; Fig. 4). The lack of sufficient cyclase 
transcription will most likely result in low intracellular levels of c-di-GMP that would not 
be sufficient to allow biofilm formation. This observation is in line with the failure to form 
biofilms in medium supplemented with >10 mM BHET (Fig. S6).
Within this framework, cAMP-CRP signaling is well known to be involved in the 
expression of inducible catabolic operons. Besides this function , cAMP-CRP signaling is

also involved in processes related to infection and biofilm formation. Thereby, a specific 
adenylate cyclase catalyzes the formation of cAMP from ATP , whereas cAMP phospho­
diesterases catalyze its breakdown (52, 53). The DSM 21264 cAMP-CRP signaling pathway 
is conserved as well , and its main regulatory protein is the CRP regulator. While CRP was 
highly transcribed under biofilm conditions, its transcription was in general much lower 
in the planktonic lifestyle. Notably, 5.0 and 30 mM BHET downregulated the CRP 
transcription even further, implying that BHET is interfering with this signaling cycle as 
well ( Fig. 6 ). Overall, the interference with key regulatory networks implies that the 
degradation products of PET strongly induce stress responses in DSM 21264. This results 
in rapid changes in several metabolic pathways and is linked to different survival 
strategies.
Based on the above -made observations , we were able to establish a putative 
first model outlining the main genes and enzymes involved in PET degradation and 
metabolism and the regulatory circuits involved ( Fig. 7 ). This preliminary model and 
our experimental data provide a foundation for future research on bacterial metabolism 
and nutritional signaling during life in the plastisphere. Since Vibrio spp. is found with 
high frequencies in the plastisphere , data from this study will help identify key factors 
involved in enriching for pathogens in this man-made habitat. Finally, this study will 
be useful for the design of bacterial strains for efficient plastic removal in the marine 
environment.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Bacterial strains and growth conditions
Bacterial strains and plasmids used in this study are summarized in Table 1. Vibrio sp. was 
cultured either at 22°C or 28°C in artificial seawater medium (28.13 g/L NaCl, 0.77 g/L 
KCl, 1.6 g/L CaCl 2 × 2H 2O, 4.8 g/L MgCl 2 × 6 H 2O, 0.11 g/L NaHCO 3, 3.5 g/L MgSO 4 × 
7 H 2O, 10 g/L yeast extract, and 10 g/L tryptone) or in AS medium 1:10 diluted (1 g/L 
tryptone and 1 g/L yeast extract) and either CMC (1% wt/vol), chitin (1% wt/vol), alginate 
(1% wt/vol), PET powder (1% wt/vol), TPA (1 mM), or BHET (0.5, 5 and 30 mM) was added. 
Additional growth experiments were implemented in M9 medium (Na 2HPO4 33.7 mM, 
KH2PO2 22 mM, NaCl 51.3 mM, NH 4Cl 9.35 mM, MgSO 4 1 mM, biotin 1 µg, thiamin 1 µg, 
EDTA 0.134 mM, FeCl3-6H2O 0.031 mM, ZnCl 2 0.0062 mM, CuCl 2 2H2O 0.76 µM, CoCl 2 2 
H2O 0.42 µM, H3BO3 1.62 µM, and MnCl2 4H2O 0.081 µM).
E. coli was grown at 37°C aerobically in the LB medium (10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast, 
and 5 g/L NaCl) and supplemented with the appropriate antibiotics.
For the observation of the phenotypical reaction and halo formation of DSM 21264 
to various concentrations of BHET , LB agar plates (10 g/L tryptone, 5 g/L yeast, 5 g/L 
NaCl, and 15 g/L agar) were prepared. After autoclaving, the respective amount of BHET 
was added to reach final concentrations of 0.5 mM, 5.0 mM, 10 mM, and 30 mM in the 
respective plate. Five microliters of DSM 21264 OD 600 = 1 was added and incubated  for
24 h at 28°C.
Fluorescence imaging analysis of biofilms
To observe biofilm formation of DSM 21264 on plastic surfaces, cells were inoculated 
at OD 600 = 0.05 in the ASW medium and incubated in 6-well cell culture plates (Nunc 
cell culture plate, catalog no. 130184; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA) at 22°C or 
28°C at 80 rpm shaking. After incubation , the foil was washed in PBS buffer and placed 
into µ-slide eight-well (ibiTreat. catalog no. 80826, ibidi USA, Inc., Fitchburg, Wisconsin). 
Cells were stained using the LIVE/DEAD BacLight bacterial viability kit (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).
Cells were visualized using the confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM) Axio 
Observer.Z1/7 LSM 800 with Airyscan (Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany) and 
a C-Apochromat 63 x/1.20W Korr UV VisIR objective. Settings for the microscope are 
presented in Table S5. For the analysis of the CLSM images , the ZEN software was used 
(version 2.3; Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, Jena, Germany). For each sample, at least three 
different positions were observed, and one representative CLSM image was chosen.
Preparation for scanning electron microscopy
Strains and polymers were incubated as described above , and after incubation , fixed 
overnight in 1% PFA in 50 mM cacodylate buffer, pH 7. The following day , samples 
were incubated in 0.25% GA in 50 mM cacodylate buffer, pH 7 overnight. For drainage
samples, the samples were incubated in 30%, 50%, and 70% of ethanol in the follow­
ing order , each for 20 min. An additional incubation in 70% ethanol was performed 
overnight. Drainage continued with sample incubation in 80%, 96%, and 100% of 
ethanol for 20 min and 100% of ethanol for 30 min. Critical point drying was performed 
using Leica EM CPD300 , washed 18 x with CO 2, followed by coating in a thin carbon 
layer using Sputter Coater LEICA EM ACE600. Microscopy was performed at the scanning 
electron microscope LEO 1525 using Software SmartSEM V06.00.
Sample preparation for RNA-seq and analysis
Precultures of DSM 21264 were inoculated at OD 600 = 0.05 in ASW medium (4 mL/well) 
in 6-well cell culture plates (Nunc cell culture plate, catalog no. 130184; Thermo Fisher 
Scientific, Waltham, MA). To each well, either PE or PET foil (35 mm diameter) was added 
and incubated for 8 hours at 22°C shaking at 80 rpm. The foil was washed in PBS buffer

to get rid of planktonic cells, and then cells were scratched off the surface. Two milliliters 
of 20% stop mix consisting of 95% ethanol and 5% phenol was added to the cells , and 
the mixture was centrifuged for 20 minutes at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded, the 
pellet was washed three times in PBS buffer, and afterward immediately frozen in liquid 
nitrogen and stored at −70°C.
The liquid cultures were inoculated at OD 600 = 0.05 in diluted artificial seawater. 
Respective C-source (CMC, PET powder (particle size 300 µm max; >50% crystallinity, 
product no. ES30-PD-000132), chitin and alginate (1% wt/vol) and BHET concentrations 
ranging from 0.5 mM, 5 mM, and 30 mM as well as 1 mM TPA) was added and incubated 
shaking at 28°C at 130 rpm for 24 hours. As negative controls , no additional carbon 
source and DMSO controls were prepared. Cells were harvested and cell pellets formed.
Harvested cells were re-suspended in 800 µL RLT buffer (RNeasy Mini Kit, Qiagen) 
with β-mercaptoethanol (10 µl mL−1), and cell lysis was performed using a laboratory ball 
mill. Subsequently, 400 µL RLT buffer (RNeasy Mini Kit Qiagen) with β-mercaptoethanol 
(10 µl m L−1) and 1,200 µL 96% (vol/vol) ethanol were added. For RNA isolation, the 
RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) was used as recommended by the manufacturer, but instead 
of RW1 buffer, RWT buffer (Qiagen) was used in order to isolate RNAs smaller than 200 
nucleotides also. To determine the RNA integrity number , the isolated RNA was run 
on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 using an Agilent RNA 6000 Nano Kit, as recommended 
by the manufacturer (Agilent Technologies, Waldbronn, Germany). Remaining genomic 
DNA was removed by digesting with TURBO DNase (Invitrogen, Thermo Fischer Scientific, 
Paisley, UK). The Illumina Ribo-Zero plus rRNA Depletion Kit (Illumina Inc., San Diego, 
CA, USA) was used to reduce the amount of rRNA-derived sequences. For sequencing, 
the strand-specific cDNA libraries were constructed with an NEBNext Ultra II Directional 
RNA library preparation kit for Illumina and the NEBNext Multiplex Oligos for Illumina 
(96) (New England BioLabs, Frankfurt am Main, Germany). To assess  the quality and 
size of the libraries , samples were run on an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 using an Agilent 
High-Sensitivity DNA Kit, as recommended by the manufacturer (Agilent Technologies). 
The concentration of the libraries was determined using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit, 
as recommended by the manufacturer (Life Technologies GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany). 
Sequencing was performed on the NovaSeq 6000 instrument (Illumina Inc., San Diego, 
CA, USA) using the NovaSeq 6000 SP Reagent Kit (100 cycles) and the NovaSeq XP 2-Lane 
Kit v1.5 for sequencing in the paired-end mode and running 2 × 61 cycles. For quality 
filtering and removing of remaining adapter sequences, Trimmomatic-0.39 (Bolger et al., 
2014) and a cutoff phred-33 score of 15 were used. The mapping against the reference 
genome of V. gazogenes  DSM 21264 T was performed with Salmon (v 1.10.2) ( 54). As 
mapping backbone, a file that contains all annotated transcripts excluding rRNA genes 
and the whole genome of the reference as decoy was prepared with a k-mer size of 11. 
Decoy-aware mapping was done in the selective-alignment mode with “–mimicBT2, ” “–
disableChainingHeuristic, ” and “–recoverOrphans” flags as well as sequence and position 
bias correction and 10 ,000 bootstraps. For–fldMean and–fldSD, values of 325 and 25 
were used, respectively. The quant.sf files produced by Salmon were subsequently 
loaded into R (v 4.3.2) ( 55) using the tximport package (v 1.28.0) ( 56). DeSeq2 (v 1.40.1) 
was used for normalization of the reads, and fold change shrinkages were also calculated 
with DeSeq2 (57) and the apeglm package (v 1.22.0) ( 58). Genes with a log2-fold change
of +2/–2 and a p-adjust value <0.05 were considered differentially expressed.
Fastp (59) was used to remove sequences originating from sequencing adapters and 
sequences of low-quality sequences. Reads were then aligned to the V. gazogenes DSM 
21264 reference assembly ( 60) using BWA mem. Differential expression analysis was 
carried out with DESeq2 (57). A gene was considered significantly differentially expressed 
in a comparison if the corresponding false discovery rate (FDR) was smaller or equal to 
0.05 and the absolute log2-fold change (|log2FC|) was larger than 2. All software was 
used with standard parameters.
Sequence data reported in this publication have been submitted to the European 
Nucleotide Archive (ENA). They are publicly available under accession PRJEB80907.

Key genes are presented in Fig. 4 to 6 . The size of the circles and color intensity were 
calculated based on the transcriptome hits per gene (absolute values) and scaled using 
log-10-fold changes to allow better scaling.
Cloning and expression of V. gazogenes UlaG
UlaG (NCBI Ref. Seq. WP_072962133.1) was cloned into pET21a(+) vector (Nova­
gen/Merck) using restriction sites NdeI and XhoI in front of C-terminal 6 x HisTag. Primers 
were designed using SnapGene (GSL Biotech LLC, San Diego CA, United States), and 
PCR was performed using parameters indicated by the design tool. After PCR cleanup, 
7 µL DNA ( ≈30 ng/µL) was mixed with 1 µL of T4 Ligase Buffer (10 x), 1 µl of T4 Ligase 
(400 U/µL), and 1 µl of purified pET21a(+) plasmid and incubated overnight at 6°C. The 
ligation construct was transformed into competent E. coli DH5α cells, and positive clones 
were identified via DNA sequencing (Microsynth seqlab). Positive sequenced plasmids 
were isolated and transformed into competent E. coli T7 Shuffle cells.
Protein production and purification
For protein production , cells were overexpressed by growing inoculated cultures with 
T7 SHuffle harboring pET21a(+):: UlaG or BL21(DE3) harboring pET28a(+):: pet6 at 37°C 
to OD 600 = 0.8. Cells were induced with IPTG to final concentrations of 0.4 mM and 
incubated at 22°C overnight until cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 × g.
For protein purification, the cell pellet was resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM 
NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) and sonicated for cell disruption with 
Ultrasonic Processor UP200S by Hielscher with amplitude 70% and cycle duration of 0.5 
units. Afterward, the proteins harboring a sixfold C-terminal histidine tag were purified 
with nickel-ion affinity chromatography using Ni-NTA agarose (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). 
The elution buffer was exchanged against 0.1 mM potassium phosphate buffer pH 8.0 in 
a 30 kDa Amicon Tube (GE Health Care, Solingen, Germany).
Measurement of PET and BHET degradation
Precultures of DSM 21264 were inoculated at OD 600 = 0.05 in 20 mL M9 medium 
supplemented with 5 mM of glucose and additional 5 mM of BHET. Flasks were 
incubated by shaking at 28°C and 130 rpm for 6 days. Each day , 1 mL of each sample 
was taken and measured at the UHPLC. As a negative control, the medium was incubated 
under the same conditions with E. coli Dh5α, and samples were taken at the same time 
points.
For the detection of PET powder and foil degradation , DSM 21264 was incubated as 
described above in six -well plates, and also 0.5 mL of sample was taken each day and 
prepared for UHPLC measurements.
For enzymatic BHET degradation , purified enzyme in varying concentrations was 
incubated with 300 µM of BHET for 24 h and samples were prepared for UHPLC.
Respective supernatants were prepared and measured at the UHPLC following 
protocols described previously (61, 62).
Cloning promoter fusion of adhE
The promoter of adhE (AAC977_10260) was identified using the software tool published 
at softberry.com ( BPROM - Prediction of bacterial promoters ) and cloned into the 
pBBR1-MCS-1 vector ( 39) carrying amCyan in the multiple cloning site using restriction 
enzymes SacI and XbaI.
Primer design, PCR, ligation , and transformation into competent E. coli  DH5α 
cells were performed as described above. Positive constructs were transformed into 
competent E. coli  WM3064 cells. Since electroporation did not result in sufficient 
colonies, the plasmid was conjugated via biparental conjugation into DSM 21264. Cells 
were grown in overnight cultures. One milliliter of donor strain ( E. coli WM3064 carrying 
the respective plasmid) and of receptor strain (DSM 21264) were mixed at ratio 1:1

and centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 8 min. Cells were washed three times in LB medium, 
resuspended after the final centrifugation step in 150 µL of the LB medium , and a
spot was given onto an LB agar plate supplemented with 300 µM DAP . The plate was 
incubated overnight at 28°C, and the spot was washed off. Dilutions ranging from 1:1 
to 1:5 were prepared and plated onto ASWM agar plates supplemented with 25 µg 
chloramphenicol and 25 µg kanamycin. Colonies were detectable after 2 to 3 days of 
incubation and inoculated in the liquid medium.
Promoter fusion measurements
For the identification of the influence of ethylene glycol on the expression of adhE, 
DSM 21264 carrying promoter fusion construct pBBR1MCS-1_ adhE_amcyan as well as 
wild-type strain were inoculated at OD 600 = 0.05 in M9 medium with 5 mM glucose. 
Cells were incubated in 48 well-plates (1 mL/well) (Nunc cell culture plate, catalog no. 
150687; Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) for 48 h at 130 rpm shaking. For the 
detection of the influence of ethylene glycol , 5 mM was added, and strains were grown 
in the presence with and without EG. After incubation , optical density and fluorescence 
of cyan (450;496) were measured with the Synergy HT plate reader using Gen5 software 
(Biotek, Winooski, USA). The average was evaluated , and fluorescence was divided by 
optical density to detect fluorescence units.
Plasma activation of PE and PET foil
For plasma activation, an atmospheric air plasma system from Plasmatreat GmbH 
(Steinhagen, Germany) was used. The atmospheric pressure plasma was produced by a 
generator FG5001 with an applied working frequency of 21 kHz, generating a non-equili­
brium discharge in a rotating jet nozzle RD1004 in combination with the stainless-steel 
tip No. 22826 for an expanded treatment width of approximately 22 mm. Additionally, 
the jet nozzle was connected to a Janome desktop robot type 2300N for repetitious 
accuracy regarding treatment conditions. The process gas was dry and oil-free air at an 
input pressure of 5 bar in all experiments.
