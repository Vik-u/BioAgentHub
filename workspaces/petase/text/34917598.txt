The global production of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is estimated to reach 87.16
million metric tons by 2022. After a single use, a remarkable part of PET is accumulated in
the natural environment as plastic waste. Due to high hydrophobicity and high molecular
weight, PET is hardly biodegraded by wild-type microorganisms. To solve the global
problem of uncontrolled pollution by PET, the degradation of plastic by genetically modiﬁed
microorganisms has become a promising alternative for the plastic circular economy. In
recent years many studies have been conducted to improve the microbial capacity for PET
degradation. In this review, we summarize the current knowledge about metabolic
engineering of microorganisms and protein engineering for increased biodegradation of
PET. The focus is on mutations introduced to the enzymes of the hydrolase
class—PETase, MHETase and cutinase—which in the last few years have attracted
growing interest for the PET degradation processes. The modiﬁcations described in
this work summarize the results obtained so far on the hydrolysis of polyethylene
terephthalate based on the released degradation products of this polymer.

INTRODUCTION
Worldwide plastic production reached 348 million metric tons in 2017, and this number increases
annually by ∼5% (PlasticEurope, 2019; Brahney et al., 2020). Predictions about plastic waste
accumulation in ecosystems suggest that in 2050 cumulative plastic waste production will reach
over 25 billion tonnes, i.e., 3 times the current level (Geyer et al., 2017). The high resilience and
persistence of plastic, previously considered an advantage, nowadays leads to the uncontrolled
accumulation of waste in every ecosystem on the planet. Most plastics never completely disappear
and only get fragmented into smaller pieces. The formed microplastics (1 μm— 5 mm) and
nanoplastics (<1 µm) spread all over the globe, reaching pristine regions separated from human
activity. For instance, plastic particles have been found in the Arctic Polar Circle (Cózar et al., 2017),
Antarctica (Waller et al., 2017), the high mountains (French Pyrenees) (Allen et al., 2019), the
Mariana Trench (Gangadoo et al., 2020) and even in the rain in protected areas (Brahney et al., 2020).
Easily transported microplastics are extremely dangerous to marine and seacoast animals. It is
estimated that more than 800 animal species are affected by plastic waste, and around 90% of all
seabirds ingest plastic (Wilcox et al., 2015). Both nanoplastics and microplastics were found in
zooplankton and phytoplankton (Rummel et al., 2017), which are consumed by organisms from
higher levels of the food chain. Hence microplastics are consumed and accumulated by invertebrates
(Thompson et al., 2004). Moreover, it was shown that nanoplastics may reduce the survival of aquatic
zooplankton and penetrate the blood-brain barrier inﬁsh and cause behavioural disorders (Mattsson

et al., 2017). A recent study showed that crop plants are capable of
effective uptake of microplastic and its transport from the roots to
the shoots (Li et al., 2020). As it turns out, the ubiquitous plastics
also affect the human body. The presence of microplastics was
found in the lungs ( Pauly et al., 1998 ) and faecal samples
(Schwabl et al., 2019). In vitro studies have demonstrated the
ability of microplastics to induce an immune response, oxidative
stress, cytotoxicity, alteration of membrane integrity and
variation in gene expression (Maeza et al., 2021).
Most of the produced plastic material has a fossil origin.
Thermoplastic materials such as polyethylene (PE),
polyurethane (PUR), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polypropylene
(PP), polystyrene (PS) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
represent 80% of total global plastic usage ( PlasticEurope,
2019). One of the most popular plastic materials used for
packing (such as the production of bottles) is PET. PET is a
polar, linear polymer of repeating units of aromatic terephthalic
acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG). The PET monomer is
designated bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET). Owing
to excellent mechanical and thermal properties, PET is mainly
used for beverage bottles, foil, textileﬁbres and food containers
(Danso et al., 2019; Taniguchi et al., 2019; Hiraga et al., 2020). The
global production of PET reached 33 million metric tons in 2015
(Geyer et al., 2017) and is still increasing. The problem that has
arisen with such enormous production of PET is partially solved
by recycling. The main goal of recycling is to obtain new PET or
recover the primary components such as TPA and EG so that they
can be used as feedstock (Lange 2002). Nowadays, the recycling of
PET is mainly based on chemical and mechanical methods. For
instance, the mechanical recycling method for PET, melt
extrusion, results in the production of rPETﬁbres from PET
bottle waste (Park and Kim 2014), whereas the most common
chemical method, glycolysis, degrades PET to BHET with a yield
as high as 95% (Imran et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2020). Although these
methods are commonly used, they still have some limitations
such as spontaneous degradation during the lifetime of new PET
obtained after re-extrusion (Park and Kim 2014) or requirement
of high temperature (150–300
°C) and catalysts in the glycolysis
reaction. Especially using catalysts (metal-based, organic or ionic
liquids) leads to the high cost of reagents and methodologies, a
negative environmental impact and sometimes to the limitation
to small-scale trials of reactions (Liu et al., 2020, Sang et al., 2020).
In recent years, biological methods have been developed
alongside the chemical and mechanical methods of PET
recycling. Biological methods are promising and eco-friendly
solutions for the decomposition of PET waste. Although PET
is labelled as non-biodegradable, much research succeeded in the
use of microorganisms or enzymes to break it down. Aﬂagship
example is the discovery of the bacteriumIdeonella sakaiensis
201-F6 and the enzymes PETase and MHETase (Yoshida et al.,
2016; Furukawa et al., 2019), which are the focus of many
scientists due to very promising aspects of future management
of PET. Other enzymes such as cutinases Thc_Cut1 and
Thc_Cut2 from Thermobiﬁda cellulosilytica DSM44535 (Acero
et al., 2011), cutinase FsC fromFusarium solani pisi(Egmont and
de Vlieg, 2000), cutinase HiC fromHumicola insolensand lipase
CALB fromCandida antarctica(Carniel et al., 2017) or cutinase
TfH fromThermobiﬁda fuscaDSM43793 (Müller et al., 2005) are
also the subject of numerous studies. To date, scientists have
veriﬁed 27 enzymes that degrade synthetic polymers (Danso et al.,
2019), among which enzymes involved in the degradation of PET
are typical serine hydrolases, e.g., cutinases (EC 3.1.1.74), lipases
(EC 3.1.1.3), and carboxylesterases (EC 3.1.1.1) (Roth et al.,
2014). Despite the knowledge of many enzymes, there are
many unsolved issues regarding their practical use to degrade
PET such as low thermal stability or transfer on an industrial scale
(Sang et al., 2020 ). Much more investigation is needed for
mutational developments of the enzyme ’s active site, which
may help to overcome the limitations.
The degradability of the polymer depends on different factors
such as shape, size, presence of various substituents, e.g., chloride
atoms or benzene rings, and it decreases with the increase in the
molecular weight (Kumari et al., 2019; Rose et al., 2020). The
bottlenecks in plastic biodegradation are their high
hydrophobicity, crystallinity, strong chemical bonds and high
molecular weight (Urbanek et al., 2018). In the past years, a
number of studies have been conducted in order to show that
many microorganisms and enzymes are capable of degrading
plastic. Researchers were mostly focused on the biodegradation
performed by wild-type strains, isolated directly from different
environments, especially from plastic contaminated areas.
Although this approach is justiﬁed due to the ubiquity of
microorganisms and their diverse biodegradability, current
studies should be more focused on improving these properties.
Published reports show that naturally isolated microorganisms
possess a limited capability for plastic degradation. Thus, more
efﬁcient production of enzymes and the improvement of
enzymes’ activity that would target speci ﬁc materials with
greater selectivity is a key to the improvement of the
biodegradation rate of plastic. Employing metabolic
engineering provides powerful opportunities in this ﬁeld
(Figure 1).
Here, we present the possibilities of genetic manipulation in
order to obtain mutant enzymes with improved catalytic activity
and thermostability in the hydrolysis of polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) and other polymers.
Enzymes Involved in PET Degradation
Mostly, the biodegradation of PET is possible by the enzymatic
activity of cutinases (EC 3.1.1.74) or PETase (EC 3.1.1.101) with
the cooperation of MHETase (EC 2.1.1.102). A number of
cutinases with PET biodegradable activity were found, e.g.,
cutinase from Humicola insolens (HiC), Thermobiﬁda fusca
(TfCut2), leaf-branch compost (LCC) (Tournier et al., 2020),
and Ideonella sakaiensis(PETase and MHETase) (Yoshida et al.,
2016; Furukawa et al., 2019). Cutinases are able to hydrolyse both
ester bonds found in aliphatic and aromatic polyesters, hence
their wide application in degradation studies of a broad range of
plastic polymers (Sulaiman et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2019a). In
contrast, PETase can hydrolyse ester bonds present only in
aromatic polyesters (Austin et al., 2018). Enzymes involved in
PET degradation belong to the esterase subclass and possess a
catalytic triad characteristic for α/β-hydrolases (Ser-His-Asp).
Ester bond hydrolysis is provided due to the nucleophilic

transported into the cell and converted to protocatechuic acid (PCA) and subsequently integrated into cellular metabolisms via the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA).

similarity in amino acid sequence with the hydrolase present in
Thermobiﬁda fusca(TfH). Furthermore, similar to cutinase from
Fusarium solani, PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis has two
disulﬁde bridges that stabilize the structure of the enzyme
molecule. Moreover, as was demonstrated before, an additional
disulﬁde bond in PETase inﬂuences the thermal stability of the
enzyme ( Matak and Moghaddam, 2009 ; Joo et al., 2018 ).
Phylogenetic analyses performed comparing these two
enzymes have also revealed the presence of a highly conserved
region recognized as a nucleophilic elbow that contains serine in
the central part of the consensus sequence (Joo et al., 2018).
Despite the similarities, an important difference is the width of
the active site cleft, in comparison with cutinase from TfH; this
slot is three times larger at its widest point in PETase (Austin
et al., 2018 ). Furthermore, the residues surrounding the
nucleophilic serine in the catalytic triad were found to be
considerably different, which affects the substrate selectivity
represented by these enzymes (Liu et al., 2018b).
Recently, many studies have been conducted to improve and
better understand the mechanisms of action of these enzymes,
especially PETase or MHETase (Oda 2021; Pinto et al., 2021).
PETase is recognized as being responsible for hydrolytic
conversion of PET into oligomers of mono-2-hydroxyethyl
terephthalate (MHET), whereas MHETase hydrolyses MHET
into terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG)
(Figure 2). Thus, recombination and overexpression of those
enzymes may be crucial for more efﬁcient degradation of PET as
well as monomer recycling (TPA and EG) and for bioconversion
to high-value compounds (Furukawa et al., 2019; Taniguchi et al.,
2019).
In mechanisms of enzymatic degradation of polyesters, such as
PET, apart from plastic properties, the protein structure plays a
key role. Especially, the regions on the surface outside the active
site of the enzymes and binding modules are essential, both in
interaction with the polymer and during the hydrolysis (Acero
et al., 2013). For instance,Liu et al. (2018a)assumed in their study
that the wide substrate-binding pocket of PETase is critical for
PET hydrolysis (Liu et al., 2018b). In contrast,Austin et al. (2018)
narrowed the binding cleft and observed improvement in PET
degradation (Austin et al., 2018). It should also be emphasized
that mutations are frequently used to create greater space in the
active sites toﬁt the large, inaccessible polymer particles and to
construct a more hydrophobic substrate-binding site (Araújo
et al., 2007). Silva et al. (2011)noted that levels of adsorption
to the PET surface are affected by the hydrophobic character of
the enzyme active site ( Silva et al., 2011 ). Thus, almost all
modiﬁcations are related to the active sites of enzymes or their
external part (Table 1). Unfortunately, during the creation of
enhanced mutants, some obstacles arise. For instance, one of the
difﬁculties emerging during enzymatic degradation of PET by
PETase is the location of the enzyme inside the cells. It is
perceived as a limiting factor in direct contact of PETase with
the solid PET. The consequence is difﬁculty in establishing a
high-throughput screening method in the evaluation of the
hydrolysis rate by the modi ﬁed strains. Fortunately, the
solution is an application of developed cell-free protein-
expression systems. The system is known as a useful tool in
functional and structural proteomics for proteins that could not
be expressed in vivo in bacterial cells. Furthermore, the system
offers several advantages in comparison to traditional cell-based
expression methods. First of all, it allows for easy modiﬁcation of
reaction conditions, shortening expression time or reducing the
volume of reaction. The productivity exceeds hundreds of
micrograms of protein per millilitre of reaction volumes.
Interestingly, in the light of the PET problem mentioned
above, application of a cell-free protein-expression system
allows for the direct contact of expressed protein with solid
PET, providing high-throughput screening of PET hydrolytic
enzymes (Murthy et al., 2004; Katzen et al., 2005; Ma et al., 2018).
Engineering of PETase
In 2016 Yoshida et al. published a report about the newly isolated
bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis201-F6 that was able to use PET as
its major carbon and energy source (Yoshida et al., 2016). Because
knowledge of the protein structure is crucial for its further
modiﬁcations, shortly afterwards many reports about I.
sakaiensis PETase (IsPETase, EC 3.1.1.101) structure were
published. It was shown that this enzyme is a hydrolase and
possesses a strictly conserved active site with a Ser-His-Asp
catalytic triad and contains an optimal substrate binding site
to hold four mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET)
moieties of PET. PETase enzyme exhibits an optimum pH
range of 7–9 and the stability between pH 6 and 10 (Liu et al.,
2019b). For puriﬁed PETase enzyme applied on PETﬁlm, pH 9.0
was identiﬁed as optimal, whereas the optimum temperature was
estimated as 30
°C( Han et al., 2017). PETase exhibits lower
activity on p-nitrophenol-linked aliphatic esters in comparison
to other cutinases, but towards PET the enzyme exhibits 5.5- to
120-fold higher activity compared to the other enzymes (Han
et al., 2017; Joo et al., 2018). Attempts to improve the native
PETase enzyme fromIdeonella sakaiensis, which requires a mild
environment for growth, are motivated by the relatively low
stability of this enzyme. Introducing modi ﬁcations to the
amino acid chain may result in enhanced thermal stability by
this protein and could help it maintain activity for a longer time
(Joo et al., 2018). Mostly the enzyme’s improvement is focused on
site-directed mutagenesis. In the study ofJoo et al. (2018)among
14 mutants, created by structural and site-directed mutagenesis,
only the variant IsPETase
R280A, where the arginine (R) in
position 280 was replaced with alanine (A), showed
increased activity of PETase. The activity towards PET ﬁlm
as a substrate increased by 22.4% in 18 h and 32.4% in 36 h in
TPA and MHET release in comparison to IsPETase
W/T.T h i s
mutant also expressed hydrolytic activity using BHET as a
substrate at a similar level compared to the wild-type PETase
(Joo et al., 2018).
The subsequent study focused on analysing the structure of the
PETase enzyme molecule, comparing it to otherɑ/β-hydrolases
enzymes, and performing the most promising modiﬁcations that
could affect the thermal properties of this protein (Son et al.,
2019). The possibility for enhancement of the PETase enzyme
was the introduction of two mutations that, as previously, would
allow the establishment of additional hydrogen bonds to stabilize
the molecule. For this purpose, an IsPETase variant possesses

Urbanek et al. PET Biodegradation
changes in serine (S) located at position 121 (to aspartic acid (D)
or glutamic acid (E)) and aspartate (D) (to histidine (H)) in
position 186 resulting in the S121D/D186H and S121E/D186H
mutants have been established.
In other studies, Son et al. (2019) have applied a previous
achievement of generating the PETase R280A mutant in the work
of Joo et al. (2018)and introduced it to the S121E/D186H mutant
described above. The study showed that the obtained triple
mutant (S121E/D186H/R280A) degrades PET 13.9-fold better
than the native protein and 2.3-fold than the previously
established R280A protein variant.
Next, Dai et al. (2021)proceeded with further prospectively
proﬁtable changes to the structure of this protein variant. The
changes in the enzyme were based on the addition of hydrophobic
substrate-binding domains such as CBM (cellulose-binding
domain), PBM (poly(3-hydroxybutyrate)) binding domain and
HFB4 (hydrophobin) to the C-terminus end of PETase. Authors
supposed that the presence of CBM, PBM or HFB4 domain in the
protein structure could improve the enzyme binding to the
hydrophobic surface of PET molecules, which would be
associated with an enhanced level of plastic degradation by
these mutants. The effect of the implemented modiﬁcations was
tested based on the amount of PET degradation products (TPA
and MHET) released during the incubation with the novel
mutants compared to IsPETase D121E/D186H/R280A
(IsPETaseEHA). The experiments showed that among the three
obtained mutants (IsPETaseEHA_CBM, IsPETaseEHA_PBM,
IsPETaseEHA_HFB4), only the protein containing an additional
CBM domain improves PET degradation. Increase in PET
breakdown products concentration was 2.28-fold increased in
comparison to the original mutant and was 251.5 µM of total
hydrolysis products. The two remaining variants signiﬁcantly
reduced PET degradation capacity (Dai et al., 2021).
In the studyHan et al. (2017)created 12 mutants in order to
identify key residues required for catalysis, most of them
showed decreased activity in production levels of MHET
and TPA compared to the wild-type PETase. Only variant
Y58A (possessing change in tyrosine (Y) at position 58 to
alanine (A)) exhibited 80.73% MHET production compared to
MHET released by wild-type PETase and T59A, which showed
full activity in producing MHET. However, in both cases, TPA
production decreased (Han et al., 2017). Ma et al. (2018)aimed
to create novel high-ef ﬁciency PETase mutants through
mutagenesis of six key residues around the substrate-
binding groove of PETase. By application of a rapid cell-
free screening system, they obtained three mutants. In
comparison with wild-type PETase, the R61A (exchange in
arginine (R) to alanine (A)), L88F (leucine (L) in position 88
changed to phenylalanine (F)), and I179F (isoleucine (I)
exchanged to phenylalanine (F)) mutants exhibited 1.4, 2.1
and 2.5 fold increases in the enzymaticaf ﬁnity to PET,
respectively. The strongest catalytic activity expressed by
TPA concentration and by weight loss of PET ﬁlm
incubated with puri ﬁed enzyme was shown by the I179F
mutant (6.38 mmol L
−1 of released TPA after 48 h of
incubation and 22.5 mg perμmol·L−1 PETase per day). L88F
and R61A mutants reached 17.5 and 13.5 perμmol·L−1 PETase
per day, respectively, whereas the degradation rate of wild-type
PETase was only 8.2 mg per μmol·L−1 PETase per day.
Furthermore, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used
to observe the changes in the morphology of the PET ﬁlm
surface after treatment with the I179F mutant in comparison
to the negative control. The surface of the PET ﬁlm was
roughened and eroded, and a large number of holes were
observed (Ma et al., 2018). In the study ofLiu et al. (2018b)
structure-guided site-directed mutagenesis was used to
improve PETase catalytic ef ﬁciency. Several mutants were
created with mutations in the active sites, substrate binding
pockets or in the residues involved in stabilizing the rigidity of
the active site. The hydrolytic activity of PETase was analysed
with respect to BHET. Only two mutants described as W130H,
where tryptophan (W) has been replaced by histidine (H) and
S209F possessing serine (S) ex change to phenylalanine (F),
showed increased activity. Interestingly, the authors
performed a PETase activity assay on PET drinking bottles.
Similarly, only two mutants, described as W130A and W130H,
had higher hydrolytic activity towards PET bottles in
comparison to unmodi ﬁed PETase ( Liu et al., 2018a ).
However, PETase retains the ancestral α/β-hydrolase fold
with a core consisting of eight ß-strands and six α-helices
and exhibits a more open active-site cleft than cutinases.
Austin et al. (2018) narrowed the binding cleft via site-
directed mutagenesis of two active-site residues and
surprisingly observed improved PET degradation. They
created the double mutant S238F/W159H (with serine (S)
in position 238 replaced with phenylalanine (F) and
tryptophan (W) in position 159 exchanged to histidine (H))
that altered important substrate-binding interactions. The
S238 mutation provided new p-stacking and hydrophobic
interactions to adjacent terephthalate moieties, while the
conversion to His159 from the bulkier Trp allowed the PET
polymer to sit deeper within the active-site channel. Moreover,
in the study, it was demonstrated that the mutant could
degrade polyethylene-2,5-fura ndicarboxylate (PEF), which is
a PET replacement. The results suggested that PETase is not
fully optimized for crystalline PET degradation (Austin et al.,
2018).
Another modiﬁcation of PETase was performed using the
Premuse tool(Meng et al., 2021), by which the selected putative
mutations in the protein structure could correspond to natural
future evolution in the amino acid chain of the protein. A
thorough in-silico analysis highlighted the potential positive
effect of the W159H/F229Y mutation to boost the catalytic
capacity of PETase. The newly obtained PETase double
mutant having modiﬁed tryptophan (W) at position 159 to
histidine (H) and phenylalanine (F) at position 229 to tyrosine
(Y) showed higher thermal stability compared to the wild-type
enzyme and the single variants of the mutant proteins (W159H
and F229Y). The authors indicated that IsPETase W159H/F229Y
after 24 h reaction at 40
°C resulted in a 40-fold increased amount
of degradation products in comparison with the native enzyme,
however, the authors did not report the speciﬁc values of the
obtained concentrations of the released compounds (Meng et al.,
2021).

Urbanek et al. PET Biodegradation
Engineering of MHETase
The MHETase discovery occurred at a similar time as PETases,
but it is not as well studied an enzyme as PETase despite the fact
that they are cooperatively responsible for the degradation of PET
by Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6 ( Tanasupawat et al., 2016 ).
Structurally, MHETase is an α/β hydrolase that exhibits high
substrate speciﬁcity and its catalytic triad is formed by S225-
H528-D492. Additionally, the domain arrangement is similar to
those observed in feruloyl esterases but in contrast to them,
MHETase exists as a monomer instead of a dimeric structure
(Sagong et al., 2020). MHETase possesses optimum temperature
at 45
°C and a wide range of pH activity between 6.5–9.0 (Palm
et al., 2019). Similar to other hydrolases, MHETase performs a
nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl carbon via serine (Pinto et al.,
2021).
The metabolic engineering of MHETase is not yet as strongly
advanced as that of PETase described in detail in the previous
section. Nevertheless, we can highlight several examples of
previous studies in which modi ﬁcations in the amino acid
sequence of this protein have been undertaken. One of the
earliest MHETase mutagenesis was carried out during the
work on the determination of its exact structure and involved
an amino acid change within the active site of the enzyme.Palm
et al. (2019)have generated a number of mutants to identify key
amino acid residues in terms of enzyme activity. Their study
revealed that one of the key amino acids responsible for substrate
binding is Phe495, whose replacement with alanine (A) resulted
in the formation of the F495A protein variant. Studies of catalytic
properties of this mutant have shown that the turnover rate of
MHET compared to the wild-type enzyme was more than 2 times
lower and was about 5 s-1 (Palm et al., 2019).
The subsequent study involving engineering MHETase to
enable its degradation of BHET was conducted by Sagong
et al. (2020) . Investigations performed by these researchers
indicated that MHETase can bind to BHET as substrate,
however, the hydrolysis activity is very low. Studies with
targeted mutagenesis indicated an important role of
hydrophobic residues Leu254, Trp397, Phe415 and Phe495 in
substrate binding and enzymatic catalysis.Sagong et al. (2020)
have performed several mutations that signi ﬁcantly affected
BHET binding by the created mutants. All of them were based
on mutagenesis at phenylalanine position 424 (F424), and for
three mutants (F424N, F424V, and F424I), a signiﬁcant, more
than 3-fold increase in activity against BHET relative to native
MHETase was observed. Additional arginine point mutation at
position 411 to lysine (R411K) was also found to result in a 1.7-
fold increase in activity against BHET substrate compared to the
wild-type enzyme. Based on the results, further mutagenesis was
performed incorporating the revealed properties of the single
mutants, which resulted in the formation of double protein
variants (R411K/F424N, R422K/F424V, and R411K/F424I).
The relative activity to BHET for the resulting mutants was
8.7, 10.5 and 11.1%, respectively than the native MHETase
possessing 1% relative activity towards this substrate. Further
studies on the MHETase mutants were conducted based on a
previous report byPalm et al. (2019)in which an important role
for the S416A mutation was identiﬁed. The resulting R411K/
S416A/F424I triple mutant was shown to be 15.3-fold more active
against BHET than wild-type MHETase. Activity assays against
amorphous PETﬁlm were performed on the triple mutant in two
variants: without prior hydrolysis of IsPETaseEHA and after
incubation with the modi ﬁed PETase enzyme (see the
paragraph on PETase protein engineering above for a detailed
description of this mutant). As expected, neither the wild-type
MHETase nor the enhanced triple mutant showed activity against
PET ﬁlms without prior IsPETaseEHA pre-treatment.
Interestingly, the researchers found that with the use of PET
ﬁlm pre-treated for 10 days with IsPETaseEHA, both the wild-
type MHETase enzyme and the triple mutant R411K/S416A/
F424I showed activity against PETﬁlm. Speciﬁed values obtained
in this study after 72 h was about 8 µM of released degradation
products by mutant variant, while for the control (wild-type
MHETase) it was 4 µM (Sagong et al., 2020).
Modiﬁcation of Cutinases
Cutinases (EC 3.1.1.74) are similar to PETase. They belong to the
α/β hydrolases group and possess the classical catalytic triad Ser-
His-Asp. In nature, cutinases are produced by plant pathogens to
hydrolyse the polyesters of the cutin and the suberin layers. In
addition, cutinases are able to catalyse reactions with various
polyesters and other substrates such as long-chain triacylglycerols
or waxes (Nyyssola, 2015). Cutinases possess a wide spectrum of
pH optima, where most prefer neutral or alkaline pH. For the
thermophilic bacteria Thermobiﬁda fusca, researchers indicate a
range of pH at 6.8–9 with optimum pH at 8.0 at an optimum
temperature of 50–55
°C( Acero et al., 2011; Hegde and Veeranki,
2013). In the case of fungal cutinase using the example of cutinase
from Fusarium solani, the optimum enzyme condition was
determined in the range of pH 7.5 –10 (Chen et al., 2008 ;
Baker et al., 2012) and the optimum temperature range for
this cutinase has been indicated at 25
°C( Baker et al., 2012),
30°C( Chen et al., 2008) and 40°C( Pio and Macedo, 2009).
Since cutinases are universal and ef ﬁcient esterases, their
modiﬁcation toward PET degradation has been done (Acero
et al., 2013 ). The effect of site-directed mutagenesis, which
exchanges selected surface-located amino acids between two
polyester hydrolases from thermobiﬁda cellulosilytica
DSM44535, has been studied. As a result, six single mutants,
one double mutant and one triple mutant were obtained. The
degradation level of amorphous PET ﬁlms was tested by
enzymatic hydrolysis with the use of derived cutinases and
quantiﬁcation of the released degradation products (TA-
terephthalic acid and MHET-mono-(2-hydroxyethyl)
terephthalate). Incubation of PET with unmodi ﬁed cutinase
Thc_Cut2 as a control was provided. PET hydrolysis was
performed for 2 days at 50
°C at pH 7.0 with the 200 µgmL-1
of enzyme on pre-washed PETﬁlms with Triton-X 100 (Acero
et al., 2013). The pre-treatment of non-ionic surfactant used in
this study may lead to a decrease in the hydrophobicity of the
polymer surface and consequently facilitate the binding of the
enzyme with the substrate (Caparanga et al., 2009; Mohanan
et al., 2020). Kinetic parameters for the mutants compared to the
Thc_Cut2 (9 s-1mM-1) were performed, as a result, mutants
carrying Arg29Asn (15 s-1mM-1) and/or Ala30Val (153 s-1mM-
Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www.frontiersin.org November 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 7711339
Urbanek et al. PET Biodegradation
1) exchanges showed considerably higher speciﬁc activity and
higher kcat/KM values on soluble substrates. However, it should
be noted that a triple mutant enzyme with Arg19Ser introduction
negatively inﬂuenced all the parameters (Acero et al., 2013).
Experiments performed on PET ﬁlm, based on the
measurement of TA and MHET released during hydrolysis
showed that there is no signi ﬁcant increase in MHET
concentration. However, an increased amount of TA released
during PET degradation compared to Thc_Cut2 occurred for
Ala30Val, Arg29Asn_Ala30Val and
Arg19Ser_Arg29Asn_Ala30Val mutations. The highest TA
concentrations measured in this experiment were 400 and
370 mM for Arg29Asn_Ala30Val and
Arg19Ser_Arg29Asn_Ala30Val, respectively. Interestingly, the
introduced Gln65Glu mutation resulted in a 36% decrease in
the concentration of the amount of breakdown products for 3PET
and completely inhibited PET degradation, despite the fact that
kinetic parameters did not remarkably differ compared to the
Thc_Cut2.
In other studies, a cutinase from Fusarium solani pisi was
genetically modiﬁed to enhance its enzymatic activity. Site-
directed mutagenesis targeted the region near the active site
and as a result, two mutants with enhanced activity towards
polyester ﬁbres were obtained, named L81A and L182A. They
showed an activity increase of four- andﬁve-fold, respectively,
when compared with the wild type, for PETﬁbres. The authors
explained the increase in activity of these mutations by higher
stabilization of TI and better accommodation of the substrate
(Araújo et al., 2007).
Another successful improvement of the enzymatic
degradation of PET was presented in the study ofSilva et al.
(2011). The active site of cutinase Tfu_0883 fromThermobiﬁda
fusca was modiﬁed by site-directed mutagenesis to increase the
afﬁnity of cutinase to PET and the ability to hydrolase it. The
mutation I218A (isoleucine (I) replacement to alanine(A)) was
designed to create space and the double mutation Q132A/T101A
possessing glutamine (Q) and tyrosine (T) replaced with alanine
(A) was designed both to create space and to increase
hydrophobicity. The activity of both single and double
mutants exhibited considerably higher hydrolysis ef ﬁciency
towards PET ﬁbres— a double mutant exhibited 1.6-fold
increased hydrolysis activity (Silva et al., 2011).
In a similar study conducted byWei et al. (2016), mutagenesis
was used to increase the activity of the cutinase TfCut2 from
Thermobiﬁda fusca. By exchanging selected amino acid residues
of the active site in a substrate-binding groove of TfCut2 with
those present in LCC, mutants with increased PET hydrolytic
activity were obtained. The most active mutants were G62A,
possessing glutamine (G) replaced by alanine (A) and G62A/
I213S where additional exchange of isoleucine (I) by serine (S)
was done. As a result, a 2.7-fold increase in weight loss of PET
ﬁlms was obtained compared to the wild-type enzyme. Moreover,
kinetic analysis based on the released PET hydrolysis products
conﬁrmed the superior hydrolytic activity of G62A with a
fourfold higher hydrolysis rate constant and a 1.5-fold lower
substrate-binding constant than those of the wild-type enzyme
(Wei et al., 2016). Next, the mutant TfCut2 G62A obtained by
Wei et al. (2016) was a subject of the interesting study of
Furukawa et al. (2019). In the study, it was found that low-
crystallinity PET (lcPET) hydrolysis may be increased by the
addition of a cationic surfactant that attracts enzymes near the
lcPET ﬁlm surface via electrostatic interactions. This approach
was applicable to the mutant TfCut2 G62A/F209A and wild-type
TfCut2. As a result, the degradation rate of TfCut2 G62A/F209A
in the presence of the cationic surfactant (dodecyl trimethyl
ammonium) increased 12.7 times over that of wild-type
TfCut2 in the absence of the surfactant. A positive effect of
surfactant addition was evident for the native enzyme as well as all
mutants used except H129E/F209S. The long-duration reaction
showed that lcPET ﬁlm had the fastest biodegradation rate of
lcPET ﬁlm so far (97± 1.8% within 30 h) (Furukawa et al., 2019).
It was also noted that the addition of a cationic surfactant, as well
as the increased reaction temperature, results in enhanced
hydrophobic interactions between the enzyme and the plastic
surface, and consequently increases the amount of enzyme bound
to the lcPET surface (Furukawa et al., 2019). Moreover, higher
temperature raises the mobility of the polymer chain, which
further facilitates the binding of the enzyme to the substrate
(Ronkvist et al., 2009).
Tournier et al. (2020)found that leaf-branch compost cutinase
(LCC) demonstrated the highest thermostability and was at least
33 times more efﬁcient than other enzymes tested in their study.
In differential scanning ﬂuorimetry experiments it was shown
that LCC is thermally stabilized in the presence of calcium ions.
To avoid salt supplementation, the authors focused on improving
the activity and thermostability of LCC by enzyme engineering.
By using the alternative strategy of replacing the divalent metal
binding with a disulﬁde bond the researchers obtained thermal
stabilization of LCC without dependence on calcium ions.
Moreover, by site-direct saturation mutagenesis, they tested
209 mutants. Most of the modiﬁed variants showed less than
1% speciﬁc activity in comparison to the wild-type LCC, but the
F243I and F243W mutations, in which phenylalanine (F) at
position 243 was replaced with isoleucine (I) or tryptophan
(W), showed elevated activity. The obtained cutinase variants
gained speciﬁc activity by 27 and 18%, respectively. Finally, they
obtained an enhanced PET hydrolase that was able to
depolymerize over 90% PET into monomers in over 10 h (10.5
and 9.3 h for mutants WCCG (F243W/D238C/S283C/Y127G)
and ICCG (F243I/D238C/S283C/Y127G), respectively with the
use of 3 mg of enzyme per 1 g of PET. The productivity of ICCG
mutant was determined at 16.7 g of terephthalic acid per litre per
hour at 72
°C, which is a 98-fold increase compared to TfCut2
investigated before (Wei et al., 2019). Wild type LCC enzyme
achieved only 53% of conversion after 20 h, which corresponds
with its lower thermostability in comparison to the mutants.
Although X-ray crystallography showed no substantial difference
between parental LCC and ICCG, molecular-dynamic
simulations revealed that mutations introduced in ICCG
facilitated the catalytic binding of 2-HE(MHET)3 compared
with parental LCC (Tournier et al., 2020).
Kawai et al. (2014)created a Cut190 (S226P/R228S), a double
mutant enzyme for PET degradation. They cloned the cutinase
gene (cut190) from Saccharomonospora viridis AHK190 and
Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www.frontiersin.org November 2021 | Volume 9 | Article 77113310
Urbanek et al. PET Biodegradation
expressed it in Escherichia coli Rosetta-gami B (DE3). It was
observed that the substitution of Ser226 with Pro and Arg228
with Ser yielded the highest activity and thermostability of the
new enzyme. Also, they noted that the presence of the Ca
2+ ion
enhanced the enzyme activity and thermostability in comparison
to both the wild-type enzyme and mutant Cut190. Circular
dichroism suggested that the Ca
2+ changes the tertiary
structure of Cut190 (S226P/R228S) (Kawai et al., 2014). High-
level expression of LCC was also achieved due to insertion of the
signal peptide sequence of cellulose Cel48S and a constitutive
promoter of the gene Clo1313_2638 (P2638) in Clostridium
thermocellum. Improved degradation of commercial PETﬁlms
was observed and maximum weight loss (approximately 62%)
was achieved after 14 days of incubation at 60
°C( Yan et al., 2020).
Genetic engineering may also be a solution to many problems
related to the stability of enzymes. For instance,Shirke et al.
(2018) underlined that aggregation is emerging as a major factor
that reduces LCC kinetic stability. In its native state, LCC is
highly prone to aggregation owing to electrostatic interactions.
Since LCC precipitates even at room temperature and low
concentrations, the puri ﬁcation and storage of enzymes
require salt concentrations that vary with protein
concentration. Moreover, ef ﬁcient PET hydrolysis requires a
temperature around 70
°C, which is very close to the temperature
of LCC structure loss. To overcome these problems,Shirke et al.
(2018) proposed the expression of native LCC inPichia pastoris,
resulting in the production of glycosylated LCC (LCCG). They
introduced three putative N-glycosylation sites, which
improved resistance to aggregation even at high-temperature
conditions, leading to a 10
°C increase in the thermal aggregation
point and a signiﬁcant increase in kinetic stability. Furthermore,
glycosylation resulted in improved catalytic PET hydrolysis
(Shirke et al., 2018 ). On the other hand, Gamerith et al.
(2017) aimed to investigate the inﬂuence of glycosylation on
the activity and stability of cutinase 1 (Thc_Cut1) from
Thermobiﬁdia cellulosilytica . They expressed Thc_Cut1 and
two glycosylation site knockout mutants, Thc_Cut1_koAsn
and Thc_Cut1_koST, in P. pastoris . However, the created
mutants hydrolysed aromatic (PET) and aliphatic (PHBV
and PBS) polyester powders at very different rates based on
quantiﬁcation of released products by HPLC. Thc_Cut1_koST
was the most effective among all enzymes. The highest TPA
yield was obtained for Thc_Cut1_koST mutant, which caused
hydrolysis of 24% of the starting PET powder amount. Due to
the fact that the Thc_Cut1_koST mutant exhibited higher
protein production yield in engineered P. pastoris yeast, this
variant was used in further studies on PHBV and PBS
degradation. The authors did not observe signi ﬁcant
differences in PHBV degradation between Thc_Cut1 and
Thc_Cut1_koST mutants, due to the similar amounts of 3-
HBA (3-hydroxybutyric acid) at around 0.5 mM after 96 h of
incubation. A similar trend was observed by investigating a PBS
ﬁlm weight loss, where a 92% decrease in the mass of polymer
ﬁlm was obtained for the applied mutant and 41% for Thc_Cut1
within 96 h of hydrolysis (Gamerith et al., 2017).
Although the main focus in genetic engineering of
microorganisms and enzymes with biodegradation activity is
directed towards PET, some studies present results for other
plastics. For instance, the alkane hydroxylase gene (alkB) from
Pseudomonas sp. E4 was expressed inE. coliBL21. A recombinant
strain secreted recombinant alkane hydroxylase (AH) and was
able to mineralize 19.3% of the low molecular weight
polyethylene (LMWPE) to CO
2 after incubation in the
compost for 80 days at 37°C, while the recipient cell was not
active at all toward LMWPE biodegradation (Yoon et al., 2012).
Synergistic Activity of Chimeric Enzymes
Chimeric enzymes, also known as fusion proteins, are proteins
formed by combining two or more unrelated genes that originally
encoded distinct proteins. The resulting proteins exhibit the
attributes of all the proteins used in the fusion and constitute
a single, combined molecule. Suitably designed hybrid proteins
offer many opportunities due to their wide range of properties
and can be used in many ﬁelds (Yu et al., 2015). Thus, the
application of multiple enzyme systems for the biodegradation of
plastic seems to be a very promising solution. It is reasonable to
assume that enzymes might be used synergistically with other
enzymes in polymer degradation due to the complementary
properties of both enzymes in both catalysis pattern and
substrate speciﬁcity (Liu et al., 2019b). A prime example is the
connection of two enzymes in the biodegradation of PET. It is
known that during PET degradation, accumulating MHET is an
important factor that limits the efﬁciency of hydrolysis. To avoid
this problem, the recombinant expression and puriﬁcation of
TfCut2 from Thermobiﬁda fusca KW3 and LC-cutinase (LCC)
were proposed. In the study ofBarth et al. (2016)the dual system
was LCC or TfCut2 combined with immobilized TfCa on the
SulfoLink resin — which was generated by the addition of
oligopeptide of glycine-serine-cysteine at the C-terminus via
site-directed mutagenesis. The introduction of the C-terminal
oligopeptide did not cause a signiﬁcant reduction in its hydrolytic
activity against p-NPB, BHET and MHET. The immobilized
enzyme maintained approximately 94% of its initial activity at
60
°C, whereas free TfCa resulted in a complete loss of activity at
55 °C. Moreover, the usage of a dual enzyme reaction system with
LCC or TfCut2 caused a 47.9% or 20.4% weight loss, respectively,
of the PETﬁlms after a reaction time of 24 h (Barth et al., 2016).
An artiﬁcial chimeric enzyme was also constructed byLiu et al.
(2018a). In their study lipase (Lip) from Thermomyces
lanuginosus and cutinase (Cut) fromThielavia terrestris NRRL
8126 were used for the construction of bifunctional lipase-
cutinase (Lip-Cut) by end-to-end fusion and overexpression in
Pichia pastoris (Liu et al., 2018b). Lip-Cut exhibited a more
efﬁcient degradation ability towards poly( ε-caprolactone)
(PCL). The weight loss of PCL ﬁlms was 13.3, 11.8, and
5.7 times higher (at 6 h) than those obtained by Lip, Cut and
the Lip/Cut mixture, respectively. GC-MS analysis revealed that the
main products produced during hydrolysis were 6-hydroxyhexanoic
acid and 3-caprolactone. Moreover, SEM analysis showed that the
surface of the PCLﬁlm became rougher and more holes were
observed after 4 h of treatment with bifunctional Lip-Cut than in
the case of other enzymes after 48 h (Liu et al., 2019a). Gamerith et al.
(2016), using C-terminal fusion, fused a hydrophobic binding
module of polyhydroxybutyrate depolymerase (PA_PBM) from

IMA 10152A. The fusion polyamidase (PA_PBM) indeed resulted in
a more active enzyme on commercial polyurethane copolymers as
indicated by the release of 4,4′-diaminodiphenylmethane (MDA)
and different oligomers (Gamerith et al., 2016).
An interesting improvement of PET degradation was the two-
enzyme system described byK n o t te ta l . ,2 0 2 0.I nt h a ts t u d y ,t h e
authors constructed an MHETase: PETase chimeric protein
covalently linking the C-terminus of MHETase to the N-terminus
of PETase of varying glycine-serine linker lengths (8, 12 or 20 aa
residues). All chimeric proteins exhibit improved PET and MHET
turnover relative to the free enzymes. Hydrolysis of amorphous PET
incubated with 0.25 mg of PETase and 0.5 mg of MHETase per gram
o fP E Tr e s u l t e di nt h er e l e a s eo f0 . 2 5m MM H E Ta n dT P Ab yP E T a s e
and 0.45 mM MHET when co-incubated with the two enzymes. The
use of the MP8, MP12 and MP20 chimeras increased the amount of
TPA released threefold (1.4, 1.45, and 1.5 mM, respectively).
Interestingly, the chimeric constructs linking the C-terminus of
PETase to the N-terminus of MHETase were not capable of
expressing the protein (K n o t te ta l . ,2 0 2 0).
Another enhancement of PETase based on the implementation
of hybrid proteins to increase its activity and thermal stability was
performed by Chen et al. (2021). The work conducted by these
researchers involved the addition of an amino acid chain containing
glutamic acid (E) and lysine (K) to the C-terminus of the PETase
enzyme, which resulted in the formation of different PETase-EK
fusion protein variants (5, 10 and 30 kDa). Thermal stability assays
performed for the obtained mutants compared to the native PETase
showed that each of the obtained proteins exhibited better stability
(80% activity after 6 h incubation at 40
°C) than the native enzyme
(65% activity after incubation under the same conditions). The
ability to degrade PET was veriﬁed by the number of released
degradation products during incubation with amorphous PET
ﬁlm and PET bottle ﬁlm. The experiment demonstrated that
each mutant caused a signi ﬁcantly higher level of PET
degradation (on both plastic type materials used) compared to
the wild-type enzyme. The best results were obtained with
PETase-EK30, which after 6 days of incubation at 40
°Cr e s u l t e d
in the release of 302.4 and 146.2 µM total MHET and TPA after
incubation with amorphous PETﬁlm and PET bottles, respectively.
The incubation with the native enzyme resulted in the release of 32.8
and 13.9 µM of MHET and TPA for the appropriate substrates,
correspondingly. It is worth noting that for the native enzyme, from
day 1 of incubation to day 6, the amount of products released did not
change signiﬁcantly. In the case of the mutants, a progressive
increase in the amount of breakdown products was noted from
day 1 to day 4 of incubation, while between days 4 and 6 the
measured concentrations were at equivalent amounts (Chen et al.,
2021).
Prospective Applications of Modiﬁed
Microorganisms and Engineered Proteins in
PET Waste Management
Since 1964 production of plastic has increased twentyfold, but
almost 50 years after the introduction of the recycling process,
only 14% of plastic packing is collected for reuse. PET used in
bottles has the highest recycling rate, but globally only 7% of it is
recycled bottle-to-bottle. Most of the plastic products after a
single use are landﬁlled, and 32% escape the collection system to
the natural environment ( Ellen MacArthur Foundation and
World Economic Forum, 2014 ; http://www3.weforum.org/
docs/WEF_The_New_Plastics _Economy.pdf). The growing
amount of plastic waste has forced the scientiﬁc community to
look at this global issue. So far the published reports have shown
that naturally isolated microorganisms possess a limited
capability for plastic degradation, and it might take decades
before microbes adapt to use plastic as a carbon source. The
published data on genetically modi ﬁed microorganisms or
chemically engineered enzymes suggest that this direction
offers a promising method for plastic waste management.
Nowadays, through the chemical engineering of enzymes such
as modiﬁcation of the active site or by introducing new bonds, we
can avoid cofactor supplementation with the simultaneous
multifold improvement of their activities, reduction of the
reaction time and increase of their thermal stability. The latter
factor might be crucial since hydrolysis of PET needs a higher
temperature than the glass transition temperature (Tg), which is
67–81
°C. A highly interesting approach that can be applied to
PET degradation technology in the future is the concept of nano-
immobilization of enzymes to improve their tolerance to
temperature and pH. The ﬁrst attempts to use immobilized
enzymes have been recently achieved successfully (Jia et al.,
2021). Another perspective, which should be included in the
discussion, is the possibility of reuse of the products of PET
degradation (such as EG and TPA) to synthesize a new PET with
similar properties as a virgin PET. This will result in reduced
demand for fossil substrates for plastic synthesis and
simultaneously may be a branch where the use of immobilized
enzymes can bring additional bene ﬁts. Prospectively, due to
restrictions and concerns over the use of GMOs worldwide,
safer and easier to safely handle modi ﬁed proteins may
become an alternative to the long-known bioremediation or
biological recycling, which seems to be a distant goal when
using GMMs. The application of enzymatic recycling with the
use of enhanced mutants of PETase cutinase may be one solution
in the future to reduce the level of contamination, and to our
knowledge, such application is one of the latest developments in
this ﬁeld (Singh et al., 2021).
An interesting attempt was made byRoberts et al. (2020),
where a microbial consortium of Pseudomonas and Bacillus
species was applied to synergic PET degradation. Such a study
may bring additional perspective about applying an enzymatic
cocktail as a possibility to provide ester bond hydrolysis in PET
formulated with engineered hydrolases. Despite the fact that
microorganisms able to produce PET-degrading enzymes and
capable of growing degradation products as the sole carbon
source can be found in nature, the efﬁciency of PET hydrolysis
is generally low. The other perspective that can be taken into
consideration in further application attempts of genetic
engineering and protein modi ﬁcation methods is related to
the successful attempt to obtain microalgae capable of
producing PETase enzyme (Kim et al., 2020). The use of an
improved mutant of this protein in similar studies could

greatly enhance the research conducted in this area and bring

eukaryotes.

low-cost substrate for genetically modiﬁed microorganisms to
produce value-added products such as enzymes, fatty acids,
organic acids and others. As emphasized in this review,
genetically modiﬁed microorganisms are a promising alternative
for the plastic circular economy.
CONCLUSION
As the production of plastics is still increasing, enzymatic
hydrolysis of PET and other plastic is gaining importance and
interest from researchers. This way of degradation of plastic is
evaluated as an environmentally friendly, novel strategy for the
recycling of post-consumer plastic materials. Thus, in order to
better adapt the enzymes to synthetic polymers, the use of
genetic engineering may be a key to solving the plastic
pollution problem. However, the engineering of novel
hydrolases exhibiting highly ef ﬁcient and speci ﬁc catalytic
properties towards PET materi als remains a challenge. All
ﬁndings presented above may provide further options to
obtain effective enzymes for biocatalytic plastic recycling
processes.
