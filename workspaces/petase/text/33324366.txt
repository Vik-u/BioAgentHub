Synthetic plastics are pivotal in our current lifestyle and therefore, its accumulation is a
major concern for environment and human health. Petroleum-derived (petro-)polymers
such as polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyurethane (PU),
polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) are extremely
recalcitrant to natural biodegradation pathways. Some microorganisms with the ability to
degrade petro-polymers under in vitro conditions have been isolated and characterized.
In some cases, the enzymes expressed by these microbes have been cloned and
sequenced. The rate of polymer biodegradation depends on several factors including
chemical structures, molecular weights, and degrees of crystallinity. Polymers are
large molecules having both regular crystals (crystalline region) and irregular groups
(amorphous region), where the latter provides polymers with ﬂexibility. Highly crystalline
polymers like polyethylene (95%), are rigid with a low capacity to resist impacts. PET-
based plastics possess a high degree of crystallinity (30–50%), which is one of the
principal reasons for their low rate of microbial degradation, which is projected to take
more than 50 years for complete degraded in the natural environment, and hundreds of
years if discarded into the oceans, due to their lower temperature and oxygen availability.
The enzymatic degradation occurs in two stages: adsorption of enzymes on the polymer
surface, followed by hydro-peroxidation/hydrolysis of the bonds. The sources of plastic-
degrading enzymes can be found in microorganisms from various environments as
well as digestive intestine of some invertebrates. Microbial and enzymatic degradation
of waste petro-plastics is a promising strategy for depolymerization of waste petro-
plastics into polymer monomers for recycling, or to covert waste plastics into higher
value bioproducts, such as biodegradable polymers via mineralization. The objective of
this review is to outline the advances made in the microbial degradation of synthetic
plastics and, overview the enzymes involved in biodegradation.

INTRODUCTION
Petroleum-derived (petro-)plastics have many desirable characteristics. They are lightweight and
have very stable chemical and physical properties, which makes them highly durable. Production
methods are well established and very high capacity, resulting in very low cost. Consequently, they
have become ubiquitous in the global economy (Barnes et al., 2009; Andrady, 2011; Hidalgo-Ruz
et al., 2012). However, accumulation of petro-plastics wastes in the environment is now a major

Mohanan et al. Biodegradation of Petro-Plastics
global problem because these materials are recalcitrant to
natural biodegradation processes. As a result of their massive
accumulation in municipal waste systems, micro- and nano-sized
plastic particles are now ubiquitous in both terrestrial and aquatic
ecosystems (Álvarez-Hernández et al., 2019; Bergmann et al.,
2019). About 335 million tons of plastics were manufactured
worldwide in 2016 (Plastics Europe, 2017). Synthetic plastics
such as polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyethylene (PE),
polyurethane (PUR), polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), and
polyvinyl chloride (PVC) have been extensively utilized in a wide-
range of industrial and domestic applications (Shah et al., 2008).
Environmental pollution by plastic waste was ﬁrst reported in
the 1970s (Carpenter and Smith, 1972). The growing amount of
plastic waste has become a global concern. Despite increasing
eﬀorts to reduce the plastic waste by disposing oﬀ through
segregated collection and recycling, a sizeable amount of plastic
solid waste is still landﬁlled. From whole plastic production by
2017 (8,300 million tons), after recycling, incineration (energy
recovery) of wastes and calculating in-use plastics in domestic;
around 60% have been left in the environment including 95% in
landﬁlls and 5% in the oceans and other terrestrial areas (Ragaert
et al., 2017). Plastic debris in the environment is degraded in
nature by photo-, bio-, and thermo-oxidative depolymerization
as well as friction (Barnes et al., 2009; Browne et al., 2011).
Although biodegradation of these plastics is feasible in the natural
environment, it can take long periods of time: from 50 to more
than 100 years (Table 1).
Based on the degradation pathways, these synthetic plastics
have been divided into two groups, plastics with a carbon-
carbon backbone and plastics with heteroatoms in the main
chain. PE, PS, PP , and PVC plastics have a backbone which
is only built of carbon atoms ( Figure 1 ). PET and PU have
heteroatoms in the main chain (Figure 1). Several biodegradable
aliphatic polyesters such as polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) and
polylactic acid (PLA), were produced and may be used
as alternatives to some petro-plastics (Tokiwa et al., 2009;
Bhatia et al., 2019a,b). Polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) have
emerged as a sustainable choice due to their putative high
biodegradability in diﬀerent environments, biocompatibility,
chemical diversity, their manufacture from renewable carbon
resources, and release of non-polluting and non-toxic products
after degradation (Bhatia et al., 2019a,b). PHAs are synthesized
and accumulated by many prokaryotic microorganisms as

storage compounds for carbon and energy when a major non-
carboneous nutrient (e.g., nitrogen or phosphorus) is limiting.
The accumulation of these polymers facilitates enhanced survival
under environmental stress conditions. However, the most
commonly used plastics are still synthetic polymers derived from
petrochemical hydrocarbons (Geyer et al., 2017).
Degradation of plastics by microbial and/or enzymatic
means ( Figure 2 ) is a promising strategy to depolymerize
waste petro-plastics into monomers for recycling, or mineralize
them into carbon dioxide, water, and new biomass, with
concomitant production of higher-value bioproducts (Grima
et al., 2000; Montazer et al., 2019, 2020a). Biodegradation
of plastics involves excretion of extracellular enzymes by the
microorganism, attachment of enzyme to the surface of plastic,
hydrolysis to short polymer intermediates, which are ultimately
assimilated by microbial cells as carbon source to release
CO2. Despite the fact that these plastics represent non-natural
chemicals, several microorganisms capable of metabolizing
these polymers have been identiﬁed in recent years. Over 90
microorganisms, including bacteria and fungi, have been known
to degrade petroleum-based plastics (Jumaah, 2017) mostly
in vitro condition.
Biodegradation is a complex process which is dependent
on several factors, such as availability of a substrate, surface
characteristics, morphology, molecular weight of the polymers
(Figure 3) and therefore, an exact deﬁnition of biodegradation
is lacking (Albertsson et al., 1987; Ammala et al., 2011; Harrison
et al., 2018). Further, biodegradation has been measured by a
wide-range of variables, including substrate weight loss, changes
in the mechanical properties and/or the chemical structure of the
polymer and the percentage of carbon dioxide emission. Early
microbial biodegradation experiments attempted to demonstrate
that microbial activity could result in changes in the physical
characteristics of plastics, such as tensile strength, crystallinity,
and water uptake (Pirt, 1980; Albertsson and Karlsson, 1990). The
identiﬁcation and genetic engineering of these plastic-degrading
microorganisms and/or enzymes will provide an opportunity
to improve plastic recycling and thereby reduce environmental
plastic pollution by means of assimilation of plastic waste into
carbon source or degradation of plastics waste into valuable
alkane products via microbial biotechnology. The biodegradation
mechanisms of petro-plastics are likely related to the types
of bonds in the polymeric chains (since the active sites of
related enzymes are individual for any speciﬁc bond). Thus,
mechanisms of petro-plastic degradation can be classiﬁed into
three groups: (i) Polymers with carbon back-bones; (ii) Polymers
with ester-bond back-bones and side-chains; and (iii) Polymers
with hetero/carbamate(urethane) bonds.
The present review outlines the recent advances made in the
microbial degradation of synthetic plastics like polyethylene PE,
polystyrene, polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, PET, and PU and,
overview the enzymes involved in biodegradation. Therefore,
the study contributes to the existing knowledge in the ﬁeld of
microbial and/or enzymatic degradation of the synthetic plastics.
Polymer degradation by microbial and enzymatic means is a
promising strategy to convert plastic waste into carbon dioxide,
polymer monomers, and possibly value-added compounds.

PETRO-PLASTICS WITH CARBON
BACK-BONES
Polyethylene, polypropylene, polystyrene, and polyvinyl chloride
have a backbone which is solely made of carbon atoms.
These polymers constitute the main packaging materials
(Plastics Europe, 2017). UV-radiation and oxygen are the
major initiation factors responsible for degradation of polymers
with a carbon-carbon backbone, leading to fragmentation or
chain scission. Photo-initiated oxidative degradation of PE, PP ,
and PS leads to reduced molecular weight and formation of
carboxylic end groups, and UV-light initiates dechlorination in
PVC polymers. The resulting smaller polymer fragments are
susceptible to biodegradation and, abiotic degradation precedes
biodegradation. Plastics Additives (1998) demonstrated that only
∼0.1% per year of the carbon that makes up the polymer
is converted into CO 2 by biodegradation under optimum
laboratory conditions.
Polyethylene
PE Degrading Microorganisms
PE is composed of a linear chain of carbons held together by
hydrogen bonds ( Figure 1 ). PE usually has a semi-crystalline
structure and is extremely resistant to biodegradation. Based
on diﬀerent manufacturing processes and subsequently diﬀerent
arrangements of the linear chains, PE polymers can have
diﬀerent densities and 3-dimensional and physical structures,
low molecular weight polyethylene (LMWPE), linear low-density

polyethylene (LLDPE), low-density polyethylene (LDPE), and
high-density polyethylene (HDPE).
Biodegradation of the PE plastic wastes by microbial isolates
has been a major topic of research (Nowak et al., 2011; Kyaw
et al., 2012; Gajendiran et al., 2016; Sen and Raut, 2016).
Microorganisms capable of hydrolyzing PE have been isolated
from soil, sea water, compost and activated sludge (Montazer
et al., 2020a). Bacteria in the gut of the greater wax worm,Galleria
melonella have been found capable of hydrolyzing polyethylene
(PE) (Y ang et al., 2014; Bombelli et al., 2017; Cassone et al.,
2020). Besides PET, biotechnological conversion of PE through
pyrolysis and transformation or direct transformation of PE to
polyhydroxyalkanoate in cells, has been reported in diﬀerent
Pseudomonads (Ward et al., 2006; Kenny et al., 2008; Guzik et al.,
2014; Montazer et al., 2019).
Bacterial species, such as Bacillus spp. (Sudhakar et al., 2008;
Abrusci et al., 2013), Rhodococcus spp. (Bonhomme et al., 2003;
Gilan et al., 2004; Fontanella et al., 2010), and Pseudomonas
spp. (Rajandas et al., 2012), and fungi, such as Aspergillus and
Fusarium (Hasan et al., 2007; Sahebnazar et al., 2010), were
shown to depolymerize PE after some forms of pretreatment
such as Ultraviolet (UV) and/or thermal treatments, which
render the carbon chains of polymer sensitive to biodegradation
(Ammala et al., 2011). Microbial degradation of untreated
PE has been reported in few others such as Pseudomonas
putida IRN22, Acinetobacter pittii IRN19, Micrococcus luteus
IRN20 (Montazer et al., 2019) and diﬀerent species of
Pseudomonas, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, P. aeruginosa
ATCC, P. putida, and Pseudomonas syringae (Kyaw et al., 2012),
Pseudomonas sp. E4 (Yoon et al., 2012), and bacterial strains
from the genera Comamonas, Delftia, and Stenotrophomonas
(Peixoto et al., 2017).
Mechanism of PE Degradation
Aerobic biodegradation of PE by bacteria occurs in four
stages: (1) Biodeterioration, which is deﬁned as formation of
carbonyl-groups by the action of oxidative enzymes released
by microorganisms or induced by exterior agents, like sunlight
(ultra-violet) exposure. Subsequent oxidation reduces the
number of carbonyl-groups and generates carboxylic acids;
(2) Biofragmentation, which involves hydrolysis and/or
fragmentation of the polymer carbon chains and the release
of intermediate products, mediated by enzymes secreted
by microorganisms; (3) Bioassimilation, whereby small
hydrocarbon fragments released by biofragmentation are
taken-up and metabolized by bacteria or fungi. and (4)
Mineralization, transfer the hydrolysis products within the cell
wall, intracellular conversion of hydrolysis products to microbial
biomass with the associated release of carbon dioxide and water
excreted out the cell. Though several groups have reported
on biodeterioration and biofragmentation (Albertsson and
Karlsson, 1990; Ammala et al., 2011), studies on bioassimilation
and complete mineralization of PE are very limited (Y ang et al.,
2014; Sen and Raut, 2016; Montazer et al., 2019).
Montazer et al. (2019) reported the biofragmentation and
bioassimilation of LDPE into biomass by the bacterial species,
Pseudomonas putida IRN22, P. putida LS46, Acinetobacter
pittii IRN19, and Micrococcus luteus IRN20. These bacterial
species were able to utilize the untreated petroleum-derived
LDPE as a sole source of carbon and energy for growth

and generate alkane hydrolysis products as well as accumulate
biodegradable polymers in the form of short chain length
(scl-) and medium chain length (mcl-) polyhydroxyalkanoates
(Montazer et al., 2019). While, A. calcoaceticus and P. aeruginosa
were found to metabolize only alkane hydrocarbons and not
LPDE (Guzik et al., 2014).
Low-density polyethylene is the most abundant plastic waste
discarded in landﬁlls in the form of plastic bags (69.13%). LDPE
is mostly amorphous, with short branches (10–30 CH 3 per 1,000
carbon atoms) and composed of one or more comonomers,
such as 1-butene, 1-hexene, and 1-octene. This branching system
makes LDPE chains more accessible and the tertiary carbon
atoms at the branch sites more susceptible to attack. The physical
arrangement of the polymer chains in LDPE and a lower
content of vinylidene defects, which have been shown to be
directly correlated with oxidization of the polymer makes it more
biodegradable than High-density polyethylene (HDPE). Further,
the molar mass of HPDE is much higher, possibly making it
more diﬃcult for microorganisms and their oxidizing enzymes
to access the polymer chains (Sudhakar et al., 2008; Fontanella
et al., 2010). Few comparison studies have been made on the
biodegradability of various pre-treated polyethylene materials,
including, LDPE, HDPE, and linear low-density polyethylene
(LLDPE) ﬁlms of diﬀerent thickness byRhodococcus rhodochrous,
which is one of the most eﬃcient bacteria for PE biodegradation
(Fontanella et al., 2010). Structural variations in PE polymers
formed during polymerization and subsequent processing, such
as unsaturated carbon–carbon double bonds, carbonyl groups,
and hydroperoxide groups (Ojeda et al., 2011) have been shown
to be consumed ﬁrst by the bacteria resulting in rapid growth.
Many of the species known to degrade PE are capable
of hydrolyzing and metabolize linear n-alkanes, like paraﬃn
molecules (e.g., C44H90, Mw 618) (Haines and Alexander, 1974).
Alkane hydroxylases (AHs) are the key enzymes involved in
aerobic degradation of alkanes by bacteria. The ﬁrst step involves
hydroxylation of C-C bonds to release primary or secondary
alcohols, which are oxidized to ketones or aldehydes, and
subsequently to hydrophilic carboxylic acids (Alvarez, 2003;
Watanabe et al., 2003). Microbial oxidation reduces the number
of carbonyl-groups due to the formation of carboxylic acids.
Carboxylated n-alkanes are analogous to fatty acids, which are
catabolized by bacteria via the β-oxidation system pathway
(Restrepo-Flórez et al., 2014). Usha et al. (2011) and Yoon et al.
(2012) have demonstrated the microbial oxidation of n-alkanes
by bacteria via the β-oxidation pathway and subsequently to the
tricarboxylic cycle. The oxidation products released by the action
of enzymes in the process may be absorbed by microbial cells
where they are catabolized.
Eyheraguibel et al. (2017) revealed that extracellular
mechanisms leading to enzymatic oxidation and hydrolysis
of chains of PE polymers are also signiﬁcant They documented
oligomers production with maximum 55 carbons (molar mass
of 105–850 g/mol) from PE ﬁlms that adsorbed by bacteria
after 240 days of incubation. AHs forms the key enzyme in the
alkane hydroxylase system pathway, which are involved in PE
degradation in β-oxidation pathway and known to degrade linear
alkanes (Jeon and Kim, 2015). The most important enzymes of
interest in the alkane hydroxylase system are the monoxygenases.
The number and types of AHs vary greatly in diﬀerent bacteria,
which itself diﬀers in the amount of carbon in the alkane chains
(Jeon and Kim, 2016). The Rhodococcus sp. TMP2 genome
encodes 5 AHs ( alkB1, alkB2, alk B3, alkB4, and alkB5) while
the P. aeruginosa genome encodes two AHs: alkB1 and alkB2
(Takei et al., 2008). The Alkane hydroxylase system has also been
well studied in P. putida GPo1, where the enzyme is involved
in the hydroxylation of the terminal carbon-ﬁrst step of the
n-alkane oxidation pathway (Rojo, 2009). Yoon et al. (2012)
have shown that AlkB enzyme of P. aeruginosa strain E7 played
a central role in the mineralization and thus, biodegradation of
LMWPE into CO2 (Yoon et al., 2012). The alkB gene was cloned
in Pseudomonas sp. E4, and the AlkB enzyme expressed from the
recombinant strain participated in the early stage of LMWPE
biodegradation, in the absence of the other speciﬁc enzymes
like rubredoxin and rubredoxin reductase. A class of multi-
copper enzymes, known as Laccase enzymes (phenol oxidases),
expressed by Rodococcus rubber, have also been shown to play an
important role in PE biodegradation (Santo et al., 2013).
New Approaches in PE Biodegradation by
Invertebrates
Recent studies have shown that the digestive tracts (gut) of
some insects function as bioreactors, with digestive enzymes and
gut microbiomes that appear to contribute to and accelerate
the biodegradation rate of some recalcitrant plastics. Riudavets
et al. (2007) ﬁrst observed that some insects are able to
chew and penetrate PE packaging. Y ang et al. (2014) isolated
LDPE-degrading bacterial strains, Enterobacter asburiae YT1
and Bacillus sp. YP1 from the gut of Plodia interpunctella
(Indianmeal moth). Bacterial isolates identiﬁed from the gut of
P. interpunctella were able to degrade approximately 6–10% of
PE ﬁlms and released 12 water-soluble products. Y ang et al.
(2015) reported the complete genome sequence of Bacillus sp.
strain YP1, one of isolates from the gut of P. interpunctella
larvae that was implicated in polyethylene depolymerization and
biodegradation. Bombelli et al. (2017) realized the extraordinary
ability of larvae of the greater wax moths, Galleria mellonella ,
to rapidly degrade polyethylene, while producing ethylene glycol
(EG). In 2019, Enterobacter sp. D1 was isolated from the gut
of G. mellonella by Ren et al. (2019). They conﬁrmed physical
changes in the PE-ﬁlm after treatment, and suggested these
physical changes were the result of oxidation reactions caused
by the bacteria.
Cassone et al. (2020) assessed the biodegradation of PE by
G. mellonella larvae and observed similar results. A diet of
LDPE alone enabled subsistence of G. mellonella larvae, but was
insuﬃcient for growth. These results suppose real biodegradation
was not occurred during passing the PE through the gut’s
larva, but the ﬁrst biodeterioration or minor oxidation may be
taken place resulting in changing in physical properties rather
than chemical ones. Billen et al. (2020) showed chewing and
ingesting of polyethylene by T. molitor larvae created holes
and reduced the size of polyethylene ﬁlms, but digestion was
not explicitly conﬁrmed. They suggested that the intestinal
microbiomes of these insect larvae play key role in the initial

Mohanan et al. Biodegradation of Petro-Plastics
short-term biodegradation process, which occurs rapidly within
the larval insect gut. However, the insect gut microbiome alone
is not suﬃcient for this initial rapid biodegradation of PE.
Rather, both the insect digestive system and the larval gut
microbiome are required to achieve accelerated biodegradation
of the PE polymers.
In recent years, biodegradation of other petro-plastics, like
PE and PS, insect larvae such as Yellow Mealworms ( Tenebrio
molitor) (Billen et al., 2020), Dark Mealworms ( Tenebrio
obscurus) (Brandon et al., 2018; Peng et al., 2019), Superworms
(Zophobas atratus ) (Peng et al., 2020b), Lesser Waxworms
(Achroia Grisella ) (Kundungal et al., 2019), and by snails
(Achatina fulita ) (Song et al., 2020), have been reported. Yin
et al. (2020) isolated two LDPE-degrading strains from the gut
of T. molitor larvae, Acinetobacter sp. strain NyZ450 and Bacillus
sp. strain NyZ451. The cells of both strains can depolymerize
LDPE but did not grow on it. Their co-culture grew on LDPE
and removed LDPE mulching ﬁlms by 18% over 30 days.
This suggests that biodegradation of LDPE requires multiple
microbes. Y ang et al. (2021) reported that antibiotic suppression
did not stop LDPE depolymerization in the gut of Tenebrio
molitor larvae indicating that the digestive enzymes of the larvae
are capable of breaking down LDPE.
Despite high rates of biodegradation of PE by live macro-
organisms, there are a number of drawbacks that may limit
the use of insect larvae as a waste management strategy for
petro-plastics like polyethylene. These limitations include: (i)
the need to sustain insect cultures to produce the larvae that
feed on PE; (ii) the potentially high cost of maintaining these
cultures; and (iii) generation of microplastics that may contribute
to environmental problems, due to incomplete degradation and
lack of mineralization Instead, ﬁnding new isolates of bacteria
and/or fungi with the ability to degrade PE, and understanding
the exact mechanisms of biodegradation pathways, may be more
eﬃcient in developing of new methods of PE waste management
(Billen et al., 2020; Montazer et al., 2020b).
Polystyrene
Polystyrene (PS) has been the most abundant plastics produced
worldwide and largely manufactured into packaging materials
for food and disposable dishware (Plastics Europe, 2017). Like
other synthetic plastics, PS is extensively used because of its good
mechanical properties and relatively low cost. PS is commonly
used in packaging foam, food containers, construction materials
(insulation), cassette boxes, compact disks, disposable cups,
plates, and cutleries. There are approximately 21 million tons of
PS produced worldwide in 2013 (Y ang et al., 2015a,b). PS has
been grouped into four types of product based on its diﬀerent
applications, General purpose polystyrene (GPPS)/oriented
polystyrene (OPS), high impact polystyrene (HIPS), PS foam,
and expanded polystyrene (EPS) foam (Ho et al., 2018). PS
are extremely stable polymers with high molecular weight and
strong hydrophobic character, which makes these polymers
highly resistant to biodegradation (Albertsson and Karlsson,
1993; Ho et al., 2018). The carbon–carbon backbone in PS is
highly resistant to enzymatic cleavage by oxidation–reduction
process (Goldman, 2010).
The biodegradation of PS by several microbes and/or
microbial enzymes has been demonstrated (Table 2). PS materials
used in these studies range from pure PS or modiﬁed PS to
PS blended with other polymers. A pure strain of P. aeruginosa
degraded the modiﬁed PS (Shimpi et al., 2012), and Curvularia
species was investigated for degradation of atactic PS, without
any pretreatment (Motta et al., 2009). The modiﬁed PSs used
have been PS/PLA composites, and PS/PLA/organically modiﬁed
montmorillonite (OMMT) blends (soft phyllosilicate minerals
that usually form in microscopic crystals, forming clays) (Shimpi
et al., 2012). Pure strains of the actinomycete, Rhodococcus ruber
have been shown to degrade three forms of PS, pure standard PS
ﬂakes, PS powder, and ELISA 96-well microtiter plates produced
from pure PS (Mor and Sivan, 2008; Santo et al., 2013). Ward
et al. (2006) reported that the P. putida CA-3 (NCIMB 41162)
uses styrene oil after pyrolysis as the sole source of carbon and
energy to form PHAs. Several investigators have shown that the
rate of biodegradation of PS foams and ﬁlms can be improved by
using the polymer-starch blends, which accelerates the structural
molecular changes (Jasso et al., 1998; Schlemmer et al., 2009;
Pushpadass et al., 2010; Nikolic et al., 2013).
Besides using starch as copolymer, the addition of prooxidants
such as metal salt (iron, cobalt, and manganese) to increase
biodegradation have also been investigated. It has been found
that trace amounts of metals such as Co, Mn, Fe, Cu, and Ni,
signiﬁcantly increase the rate of oxidative degradation (Gorghiu
et al., 2004). Prooxidants facilitates cleavage of molecules into
smaller fragments containing hydrophilic oxygenated groups
that can be easily biodegraded by microorganism in the
environment (Shang et al., 2003). Ojeda et al. (2009) reported
improved biodegradability of foamed PS when Co and Mn based
prooxidant additives were used.
Styrene itself can be used as a carbon source for growth
by some microorganisms (Sielicki et al., 1978; Kaplan et al.,
1979; Mor and Sivan, 2008; Motta et al., 2009). R. ruber has
been reported to form bioﬁlms on PS and partially degrade it
(Mor and Sivan, 2008). Styrene catabolism involves the oxidation
of styrene to form phenylacetate, which is then converted via
the TCA cycle (Di Gennaro et al., 1999). Similar to PE, both
laccase and oxidoreductases have been shown to be involved in
the biodegradation of PS, such as the AlkB family hydroxylases
and hydroquinone peroxidase (Nakamiya et al., 1997; Jeon and
Kim, 2015). Xu et al. (2019) has demonstrated the bio-catalytic
mechanism of PE and PS degradation by oxidoreductase using
quantum mechanism calculations, with the P450 monooxygenase
involved in a typical saturated carbon-carbon bone cleavage
reaction (Matthews et al., 2017).
Biodegradation of polystyrene foam (or Styrofoam) has
been reported intensively during last 5 years. Y ang et al.
(2015a,b) found that the larvae of Tenebrio molitor are capable
of depolymerizing and mineralizing PS to H 2O and CO 2
within 24 h, and the degradation is gut microbe dependent
based on antibiotic suppression test. The ubiquity of gut-
microbe dependent depolymerization and biodegradation of PS
in T. molitor has been conﬁrmed by multiple researchers (Y ang
et al., 2018a,b, 2021). The same PS biodegradation pattern has
also been observed in the members of darkling beetles including

50071 (Kim et al., 2020) was isolated from Z. atratus . The
mass reduction rates by the bacterial cultures were much slower
than that occurred in the gut of the larvae, suggesting that the
synergetic biodegradation occurs in the digestive systems. In
addition, PS depolymerization with limited extent pattern was
also observed in the digestive intestines of land snails, Achatina
fulica (Song et al., 2020) and larvae of Galleria mellonella (Lou
et al., 2020). Antibiotic suppression with oxytetracycline did not
stop PS depolymerization in the snails, suggesting the presence of
PS-degrading enzyme(s).
Polypropylene
Polypropylene (PP), expressed as C nH2n, is also the most widely
used linear hydrocarbon polymers among the synthetic polymers.
PP has a methyl-group in place of one of the hydrogens present
in PE on every other carbon, which gives rise to the presence

Mohanan et al. Biodegradation of Petro-Plastics
of three stereoisomeric forms namely, atactic, isotactic, and
syndiotactic (Baker and Mead, 2002). This polymer was ﬁrst
synthesized by J. Paul Hogan and Robert L. Banks in 1951 with
propylene as the monomer (Stinson, 1987). Metallocene catalysts
have also been used for its synthesis. Its properties are similar
to polyethylene, but it is slightly harder and more heat resistant
and has a high chemical resistance Polypropylene is the second-
most widely produced commodity plastics (after polyethylene)
and it is often used in packaging and labeling. These plastics
ﬁnd a range of applications including food packaging, textiles,
lab equipment, and automotive components. PP are grouped
as polyoleﬁns together with PE, deﬁned as inert materials not
prone to microbial attack because of the hydrophobic backbones
composed of long carbon chains, high molecular weight (from
10,000 to 40,000 g/mol) and the added antioxidants and
stabilizers during their manufacture which prevents polyoleﬁns
from atmospheric oxidation (Zheng and Y anful, 2005). However,
substitution of methyl in place of hydrogen in the β-position
makes it more resistant to microbial attack (Zuchowska et al.,
1998, 1999).
Very few studies of PP biodegradation have been reported
(Table 2). Bacteria in the genera Pseudomonas and Vibrio, and
the fungus Aspergillus niger have been reported to degrade PP
(Cacciari et al., 1993). Most of the studies have been carried out
using pretreated PP. The pretreatment techniques involved γ-
irradiation (Iwamoto and Tokiwa, 1994), UV-irradiation (Huang
et al., 2005; Kaczmarek et al., 2005; Sameh et al., 2006), or thermal
treatment (Ramis et al., 2004) and have been shown to reduce the
hydrophobicity of the polymer or introduces groups such as C=O
or –OH, which are more susceptible to degradation. Formation of
new groups (carbonyl and hydroxyl) and a decrease in viscosity
have been observed during the degradation process (Iwamoto
and Tokiwa, 1994; Sameh et al., 2006). Bacillus ﬂexus has been
shown to biodegrade UV-pretreated PP (Arkatkar et al., 2010).
Biodegradation of polypropylene have been improved by using
polymer blends with carbohydrates, starch or cellulose blends like
that reported for polyethylene and polystyrene. The use of the
blends facilitates adhesion of the microorganisms to the surface
of the polymer and acts as a co-metabolite (Cacciari et al., 1993;
Zuchowska et al., 1998; Ramis et al., 2004; Kaczmarek et al.,
2005; Morancho et al., 2006). Biodegradation of Polycaprolactone
(PCL) blended PP has also been demonstrated using lipase
since lipase is well known to degrade the ester linkages of PCL
(Weiland et al., 1995).
Polyvyinylchloride
Poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC) is a synthetic polymer well known for
many years and are widely used in its rigid or plasticized form
(Braun, 2004). However, the pollution caused by waste PVC-
based plastics is a serious problem. Many studies have reported
on the thermal and photo degradation of PVC (Braun, 1975;
Owen, 1976, 2012; Decker, 1984; Seppala et al., 1991). Torikai
and Hasegawa (1999) reported accelerated photodegradation of
PVC when exposed to short-wavelength radiation. However,
biodegradation of PVC has been attempted in very few studies
(Klrbas et al., 1999; Kaczmarek and Bajer, 2007; Ali et al., 2014;
Giacomucci et al., 2019) and shown by very few microorganisms
(Table 2). White rot fungi in the Basidiomycotina were reported
to biodegrade low molecular weight PVC when subjected
to nutrient (nitrogen, carbon or sulfur) limiting conditions
(Klrbas et al., 1999).
The ability of the white rot fungi to degrade the
organopollutants to carbon dioxide, has been shown to
be dependent on a nonspeciﬁc, non-stereo-selective lignin
degrading system. Lignin is a complex heteropolymer and
is probably the most-diﬃcult-to degrade naturally occurring
organic compound. The lignin degrading system includes a
group of peroxidases known as Ligninases, which catalyze the
initial oxidative depolymerization of lignin polymers (Bumpus
and Aust, 1987; Bumpus et al., 1988; Shah et al., 1992). The
growth of Trichocladium sp. and Chaetomium sp. was accelerated
in the presence of cellulose with PVC as a carbon source,
suggesting co-meatbolims of PVC with the cellulose (Kaczmarek
and Bajer, 2007). Also, additives introduced into plastics such as
plasticizers, contribute to fungal nutrients for growth.
Pseudomonas citronellolis and Bacillus ﬂexus have also been
found to biodegrade PVC ﬁlm, with high depolymerizing activity
toward PVC additives relative to the PVC polymer chains
(Giacomucci et al., 2019). These strains have been shown to
form dense bioﬁlm on the plastic ﬁlm surface and cause a
decrease in the mean molecular weight of the PVC ﬁlm. A dense
bioﬁlm and a decrease in mean molecular weight (Mn) has been
reported as proof of polymer chain biodegradation (Das et al.,
2012; Wilkes and Aristilde, 2017; Syranidou et al., 2017; Ahmed
et al., 2018). Decreases in molecular weight can be attributed
to the action of exocellular enzymes released into the culture
medium, which causes the hydrolysis of polymers at the ends
of backbone chains as well as within the chains (Wilkes and
Aristilde, 2017). Pseudomonas putida strain AJ was reported to
use vinyl chloride monomers as carbon source for growth (Verce
et al., 2000). The composting and biodegradation processes of
PVC are still controversial because of the possible formation of
degradation products containing chlorine, which are not neutral
for the environment.
Peng et al. (2020a) found that T. molito r larvae are capable
of depolymerizing and biodegrading PVC materials rapidly
to organic chlorinated intermediates but mineralization extent
was very limited with only 2.9% of PVC conversion to
chloride. The depolymerization stopped when gut microbes were
suppressed with antibiotic gentamicin, indicating gut-microbial
dependence, similar to observations recorded for PS degradation
by T. molitor larvae.
PETRO-PLASTICS WITH ESTER-BOND
BACK-BONES AND SIDE-CHAINS
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) and polyurethane (PU) plastics
have heteroatoms in the main chain. Plastics composed of
polymers with carbon and hetero atoms in the main chain
have improved thermal stability relative to polymers with only
carbon backbone (Venkatachalam et al., 2012). These polymers
are susceptible to hydrolytic attack of e.g., ester or amide
bonds (Muller et al., 2001). Plastics with heteroatoms in the

main chain can be degraded by photo-oxidation, hydrolysis and
biodegradation (Muller et al., 2001). This results in the formation
of smaller fragments and carboxylic end groups.
Polyethylene Terephthalate
PET Degrading Microorganisms
Polyethylene terephthalate is one of the major synthetic petro-
plastics ( Figure 1 ) that is produced in very large amounts
globally. Its worldwide production accounted to 56 million tons
in 2013 (Neufeld et al., 2016). PET consists of aromatic polyesters
with high glass transition temperatures (Tg) of approximately
75–80◦C in air. However, Tg decreases to 60–65 ◦C in aqueous
solution (Kawai et al., 2014). At temperatures above the Tg, the
amorphous regions of PET become ﬂexible and more accessible
to microbial degradation and/or enzymatic attack. With polymer
degradation, a decrease in Tg was observed as a result of
reduction in the average chain length, due to the higher motility
of shorter chains (Odusanya et al., 2013).
PET is used in a wide-variety of applications, such as
in manufacturing bottles, containers, textile ﬁbers, and ﬁlms.
PET polymers diﬀer in crystallinities based on its usage.
While, most PET used for manufacturing textiles and bottles
has high crystallinity (30–40%), PET used for packaging has
less crystallinity (approximately 8%) (Kawai et al., 2014).
Commercially available low-crystalline PET (PET-GF) has
approximately 6–7% crystallinity (Ronqvist et al., 2009; Kawai
et al., 2014).
Although most biodegradable plastics are polyesters
[e.g., polyhydroxyalkanoate, PCL, polybutylene succinate,
polybutylene succinate-co-adipate, and poly(butylene adipate-
co-terephthalate) (PBAT)], PET, which is also a polyester, but
is considered to be recalcitrant to biodegradation (Marques-
Calvo et al., 2006). However, several microorganisms capable
of metabolizing these polymers have been identiﬁed in recent
years (Table 2). These include the bacterium Ideonella sakaiensis
201-F6, is able to depolymerize PET polymers and utilize
the terephthalate subunits as a carbon and energy source for
metabolism and growth (Yoshida et al., 2016). Biotechnological
conversion of PET through pyrolysis and conversion to
polyhydroxyalkanoate has been demonstrated using diﬀerent
Pseudomonads (Ward et al., 2006; Kenny et al., 2008; Guzik
et al., 2014). Pyrolysis of PET resulted in terephthalate, which
was used as feedstock for P. putida GO16 (Kenny et al., 2012).
The degradation rate of PET ﬁlms depends on the crystallinity,
purity of ﬁlms and orientation of the polymer chains. The
degradation of the commercially available standard PET ﬁlm

Mohanan et al. Biodegradation of Petro-Plastics
(pure and amorphous PET) at 50 ◦C was found signiﬁcantly
lower (approximately 5%), however, the degradation increased
with high temperatures (55, 60, and 65 ◦C) to more than 30%
(Oda et al., 2018).
Mechanism of PET Biodegradation
Yoshida et al. (2016) demonstrated that PET-digesting enzyme
labeled as PETase, converts PET to mono(2-hydroxyethyl)
terephthalic acid (MHET), with minimal amounts of terephthalic
acid (TPA) and bis(2-hydroxyethyl)-TPA as secondary products
(Figure 4 ). Another enzyme, MHETase (MHET-digesting
enzyme), further hydrolyzes MHET into the two monomers,
TPA and EG ( Figure 4 ). Li et al. (2019) has reported the
metabolism of EG, the second component of PET besides
terephthalate, in P. putida KT2440. The metabolism of EG and
its derivatives has resulted in diﬀerent oxidation products such
as glycolaldehyde, glyoxal, glycolate, and glyoxylate ( Figure 5 ),
which have a variety of value-added applications. These ﬁnd
use as reactive building blocks in the production of agro-,
aroma-, and polymer chemicals, or pharmaceuticals (Sajtos,
1991; Mattioda and Christidis, 2000; Yue et al., 2012). Several
microorganisms have been reported to utilize EG such as those
from Acetobacter and Gluconobacter (DeLey and Kersters, 1964),
Acinetobacter and halophilic bacterium, T-52 (ATCC 27042)
(Gonzalez et al., 1972; Caskey and Taber, 1981), Flavobacterium
species (Child and Willetts, 1978), Hansenula (Harada and
Hirabayashi, 1968), Candida, Pichia naganishii AKU4267, and
Rhodotorula sp. 3Pr-126 (Kataoka et al., 2001).
The genetic mechanism for the pathways enabling EG
metabolism has been well demonstrated in P. putida. P. putida
strain JM37 was able to utilize EG as a sole source of carbon
and energy. However, while P. putida KT2440 was able to use
EG a carbon source, it did not grow well. Both strains were
able to metabolize EG and produced glycolic acid and glyoxylic
acid (Figure 5). Initially, the diol is oxidized into glyoxylate in a
series of reactions catalyzed by a set of dehydrogenases genes that
encode the PP_0545, PedI, PedE, and PedH enzymes (Muckschel
et al., 2012; Wehrmann et al., 2017). The conversion of EG to
glyoxylate yields three reducing equivalents, either in the form of
PQQH2, NADH, or in a direct coupling to the electron transport
chain. Glyoxylate can be further metabolized by the Glyoxylate
carboligase B (GclB) enzyme or AceA enzyme involved in the
glyoxylate shunt (Blank et al., 2008) yielding two molecules of

In P. putida strain JM37, the activity of two additional
pathways, namely, Gcl and GlcB, leads to rapid metabolism of
EG without accumulation of the intermediates and/or oxalic
acid (Muckschel et al., 2012). In case of P. putida U and
P. aeruginosa, the Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ)-dependent
alcohol dehydrogenases involved are the PedE and PedH, and
the ExaA (formerly QedH) enzymes (Arias et al., 2008). These
periplasmic enzymes have been found essential for growth
utilizing ethanol as a carbon source, since it catalyzes the
oxidation of the substrate into acetaldehyde (Gorisch, 2003).

utilization upon overexpression of Glyoxylate carboligase ( gcl)

PETRO-PLASTIC WITH
HETERO/CARBAMATE(URETHANE)
BONDS: POLYURETHANE
Polyurethanes (PUs) are widely used synthetic polymers ﬁnding
applications as microplastics in the medical (e.g., catheters)
and industrial products (especially as foams and domestic
consumables; Figure 1 ). PUs also ﬁnds use in adhesives,
insulation, coats, tires, sponges, paints, and ﬁbers (Howard, 2002;
Zheng et al., 2005; Shah et al., 2008). PU is not abundant in
nature and only a few microbial strains have been reported
to eﬃciently degrade it. Extensive degradation of plastic waste
generates microplastic (particles with a size smaller than 5 mm)
(Zheng et al., 2005; Shah et al., 2008; do Sul and Costa, 2014).
Microplastics pose a major problem to environment and human

health, since the particles are shown to attract and store toxic
compounds such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDs),
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and bisphenols (Bouwmeester
et al., 2015). Microplastics comprising PU foams, PE particles,
and PP particles, form the major pollutants with a half-life
estimated to be ∼50 years in sea water (Plastics Europe, 2017;
Sharma and Chatterjee, 2017; Kim et al., 2015) and polluting
coastal and marine habitats (Sharma and Chatterjee, 2017).
PU is biodegraded through hydrolytic cleavage of urethane
bonds (Nakajima-Kambe et al., 1999; Figure 6). Few fungal and
bacterial species are shown to degrade polyester-polyurethane
through enzymatic hydrolysis of ester linkages (Nakajima-Kambe
et al., 1999; Howard, 2002; Table 2). Fungi isolated from soil
such as those from Aureobasidium pullulans, Cladosporium sp.,
Curvularia senegalensis , and Fusarium solani were reported to
degrade polyester–polyurethane (Crabbe et al., 1994). A variety
of bacterial strains were able to use polyester-polyurethane
polymers as carbon, nitrogen and energy source for growth,
e.g., P. aeruginosa (Kay et al., 1991), Corynebacterium sp. (Kay
et al., 1991), Comamonas acidovorans (Nakajima-Kambe et al.,
1995), Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens (Howard and Blake, 1998),
Acinetobacter calcoaceticus (El-Sayed et al., 1996), and Bacillus
subtilis (Rowe and Howard, 2002).
ENZYMES INVOLVED IN DEGRADATION
OF SYNTHETIC POLYMERS
Petro-pastics are well known to be highly recalcitrant to
natural biodegradation processes. However, as discussed above,
some microorganisms can degrade certain polymers, under
certain conditions. Microorganisms that degrade plastic may
be considered living bioreactors. Polymer chains are broken by
enzymes secreted by the microbes, and the hydrolysis products
are taken up and metabolized. The identities of enzymes involved
in the degradation petro-polymers like PE and PP , and the
mechanisms of these enzyme-substrate interactions, are largely
unknown. However, some progress in identifying the types of
enzymes involve in petro-polymer degradation has been made.
Enzymatic activities include hydrolysis/oxidation/hydroxylation,
resulting in cleavage of the polymer chains into oligomers and
monomers. From the point of view of enzymatic degradation,
petro-polymers can be classiﬁed in two groups; hydrolysable
(PET and PUR) and non-hydrolysable (PE, PS, PP , and PVC).
The biodegradation pathways utilized by these two groups are
signiﬁcantly diﬀerent (Wei and Zimmermann, 2017). The ester
bonds in petro-plastic polymers are the same as ester bonds in
other polyester polymers, and enzymes that cleave ester bonds are

Mohanan et al. Biodegradation of Petro-Plastics
known as esterases. There are many diﬀerent types of esterase,
which diﬀer in their protein structure, substrate speciﬁcity, and
biological functions. Polymers with hydrolysable ester bonds in
their backbones, such as PET and PUR, are more susceptible to
biodegradation than polymers with carbon chain backbones, like
PE, PS, PP and PVC. Enzymes that degrade the high-molecular
weight polymers of PET and ester-based PU are known and
details of their activities have been characterized. However, to
date, no speciﬁc enzymes with the ability to biodegrade PE, PS,
PP , or PVC have been well characterized, and the mechanisms
of degradation the covalent bonds in carbon backbone petro-
polymers are currently unknown. Figure 7 shows the selected
enzymes from diﬀerent microorganisms capable of hydrolyzing
petro-polymers and synthetic polyesters.
It is presumed that large, high molecular weight polymers
are ﬁrst degraded by extracellular enzymes, secreted by
microorganisms, into smaller subunits (oligomers and/or dimers)
that can be incorporated into the microbial cells. Once in the cells,
these degradation products are channelled through the classical
catabolic pathways to yield energy and reducing power for cell
growth. The microbial degradation of petro-polymers is known
as a very slow process ( Table 1). The high resistance of these
polymers mainly stems from their high molecular weight and the
extremely hydrophobic surfaces, which prevent these molecules
from transiting the cell wall. Diﬀerent levels of degradability are
thought to depend on the extent of amorphous and crystalline
forms, and the presence of strong C–C bonds, which are very
resistant to attack by enzymes.
Cutinases (EC 3.1.1.74) are a sub-class of esterase enzymes
that have gained importance because of their ability to hydrolyze
polyesters with a high molar mass (Chen et al., 2013). Cutinases
are α/β hydrolases or carboxylic ester hydrolases originally
extracted from plant pathogenic fungi, e.g., Fusarium solani
pisi (Purdy and Kolattukudy, 1975; Kollattukudy, 1981; Heredia,
2003). The enzyme caught attention for their phytopathogenicity
as they can hydrolyze the cutin of the cuticular layer in leaves or
the suberin in bark.
A polyesterase capable of hydrolyzing aromatic polyesters
(primarily PET) was ﬁrst reported from Thermobiﬁda fusca by
a German research group (M¸ller et al., 2005). A variety of
cutinases were also puriﬁed and characterized from bacterial
strains of thermophilic actinomycetes (Zimmermann and Billig,
2011; Chen et al., 2013; Wei et al., 2014a), for instance
Thermomonospora fusca (Fett et al., 1999), Thermobiﬁda fusca
(Kleeberg et al., 2005), Thermobiﬁda alba (Hu et al., 2010),
Thermobiﬁda cellulosilytica (Herrero Acero et al., 2011), and
Thermomonospora curvata (Wei et al., 2014b; Islam et al.,
2019). Cutinases have also been reported to hydrolyse aliphatic
polyesters e.g., PCL (Kleeberg et al., 2005; Baker et al., 2012) as
well as aliphatic aromatic co-polyesters such as PET (Herrero
Acero et al., 2011; Ribitsch et al., 2012a; Roth et al., 2014;
Wei et al., 2014b; Gamerith et al., 2017) and polytrimethylene
terephthalate (PTT) (Eberl et al., 2009).
Several studies on PET degradation revealed that all known
PET hydrolases belong to the cutinase group (Tokiwa and
Calabia, 2007; Zimmermann and Billig, 2011; Baker et al.,
2012). Further, crystal structures of PET-hydrolyzing cutinases
have been analyzed for the substrate-binding domain and
possible mutations to improve the degradation rates. Protein
engineering studies on cutinases (Silva et al., 2011; Herrero
Acero et al., 2013) and fusion to binding domains (Zhang
et al., 2010; Ribitsch et al., 2013, 2015) have demonstrated
enhanced polymer degradation. In latter approach, cutinases
(from T. cellulosilytica and T. fusca ) were fused to binding
domains like polyhydroxyalkanoate binding modules (PBM)
(Ribitsch et al., 2013), carbohydrate binding modules (CBM)
(Zhang et al., 2010; Ribitsch et al., 2013) and hydrophobins
(Ribitsch et al., 2015). In all cases, the activity and thus the
hydrolysis toward PET was enhanced compared to the wild-type
enzyme, which did not possess a hydrophobic binding-domain
for a targeted polymer degradation. The fusion of hydrophobins
(HBF4 or HBF7) to a PET-degrading cutinase (Thc_Cut1)
enhanced the depolymerization up to 16 times (Ribitsch et al.,
2015). Fusion of a PBM to the enzyme enhanced hydrolysis by
11-fold compared to the wild-type enzyme (Ribitsch et al., 2013).
Enzymatic hydrolysis of PET may occur via two mechanisms:
(1) enzymatic surface modiﬁcation of polyester ﬁbers; or
(2) enzymatic hydrolysis of the polymer. Enzymatic surface
modiﬁcation is carried out by PET surface-modifying enzymes
or hydrolases, such as lipases, cutinases, carboxylesterases and
proteases. These enzymes do not hydrolyze the PET polymer
chains, but degrade the surface of the polymer. However,
management of PET waste requires substantial degradation
of the PET chains. Very few cutinases have been recognized
as PET hydrolases that can degrade the inner block of PET
(by at least 10%) since the ﬁrst discovery of PET hydrolase
by M¸ller et al. (2005).
Several hydrolases have been tested for the surface
hydrophilization of PET ﬁbers, such as lipases from Candida
antarctica (Vertommen et al., 2005), Triticum aestivum
(Nechwatal et al., 2006), Thermomyces lanuginosus (Eberl et al.,
2009), and Burkholderia spp. (Lee and Chung, 2009); fungal
cutinases from Fusarium solani (Alisch-Mark et al., 2006; O’Neill
et al., 2007), Penicillium citrinum (Liebminger et al., 2007), and
Aspergillus oryzae, Humicola insolens (Ronqvist et al., 2009); and
those from actinomycetes, Saccharomonospora viridis (Kawai
et al., 2017), T. fusca (Brueckner et al., 2008), Thermobiﬁda
cellulosilytica (Herrero Acero et al., 2011), Thermobiﬁda alba
(Ribitsch et al., 2012b); carboxylesterases (Billig et al., 2010) and
Esterases (Thermobiﬁda halotolerans) (Ribitsch et al., 2012a).
Besides crystallinity, hydrophobicity, surface topology, and
molecular size of synthetic polymers (Tokiwa et al., 2009; Webb
et al., 2013; Wei and Zimmermann, 2017), enzymatic PET
degradation is also dependent on the reaction temperatures
(>Tg, preferably 65–70 ◦C in aqueous solution), and the
enzyme structure (active site accessibility to the polymer
surface; Zumstein et al., 2017; Islam et al., 2019). Polyesterases
preferentially hydrolyzes amorphous regions of PET (Welzel
et al., 2002; Brueckner et al., 2008; Ronqvist et al., 2009; Donelli
et al., 2010; Gamerith et al., 2017). Increased crystallinity limits
the movement of polymer chains and therefore, decreases the
availability of polymer chains for enzymatic attack. None of the
PET hydrolases reported so far degrades the crystalline polymers
such as those in PET bottles, textiles, and biaxially stretched

ﬁlms. Degradation of the polyesters was found promoted
at higher temperatures. Increased temperatures (over 55 ◦C)
also contributed to the disinfection of digested plastic waste
(Islam et al., 2019).
Polyhydroxyalkanoate binding modules (PBM) have also been
used to degrade polyurethane polyester co-polymers (Gamerith
et al., 2016). The fusion of polyamidase and PBM (PA-PBM)
improved hydrolysis of PU polymers by fourfold relative to
the native enzyme (Gamerith et al., 2016). Many studies were
conducted on the esterase-activities in the microbial degradation
of polyester-polyurethane (Akutsu et al., 1998; Rowe and
Howard, 2002). Membrane associated (e.g., PudA) (Akutsu et al.,
1998) and extracellular (e.g., PueA, PueB) (Allen et al., 1999;
Ruiz et al., 1999; Vega et al., 1999). Polyurethanases (PUases)

from Pseudomonas chlororaphis, P. ﬂuorescens, and Comamonas
acidovorans TB-35) were characterized. The degradation of
polyurethane, like other polymers, occurs in a two-step
process with PU-esterase (PudA). Firstly, a surface-binding
domain promotes hydrophobic adsorption of PudA to the PU
surface and, hydrolysis of ester bonds forms the second step
(Akutsu et al., 1998).
Islam et al. (2019) reported an improved binding and
depolymerization of polyester-polyurethane nanoparticles by
fusion of the anchor peptide, Tachystatin A2 (TA2) to the cutinase
from Thermomonospora curvata (Tcur1278). Anchor peptides
are metal-binding adhesion peptides, which provide a versatile
tool for a targeted degradation of microplastics and/or polymers
such as PET, PP , and PU, at ambient temperature in highly
diluted suspensions. Tachystatin A2 (44 aa) has been known to
from a dense monolayer on PP and PS surfaces (Osaki et al.,
1999). TA2 was reengineered via a directed evolution campaign
(following the KnowVolution strategy) (R¸bsam et al., 2018b)
and employing a specialized diversity generation protocol for
short peptides (termed PePevo) to create variants with increased
binding to PS and PP in the presence of surfactants (LAS and
Triton X-100) (R¸bsam et al., 2018a). The fusion of TA2 to
the cutinase (Tcur1278) accelerated the degradation of polyester-
polyurethane nanoparticles by a factor of 6.6 relative to the
wild-type Tcur1278.
Blending of the plastics with certain types of natural polymers,
such as starch, has been shown to increase their biodegradation
(Otake et al., 1995; Zheng et al., 2005; Ammala et al., 2011;
Karimi and Biria, 2019). The mechanism for the enhanced
biodegradation has been linked to the rapid enzymatic hydrolysis
of starch thereby making the polymer porous and susceptible
to both biotic and abiotic degradations (Wool et al., 2000;
Bonhomme et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2013). Karimi and Biria (2019)
reported the biodegradation of LDPE-starch blend samples by
an alpha-amylase aqueous solution. Amylase was found to have
a co-metabolic behavior and hydrolyzed the primary speciﬁc
substrate (starch) as well as PE molecules. Moreover, the addition
of hydrophilic starch into hydrophobic PE was found to enhance
the biodegradability of both polymers (Hoque et al., 2013).
The AHs of Pseudomonas sp. strain E4 were shown to
play an important role in biodegradation of a non-oxidized
LMWPE (Yoon et al., 2012). LMWPE has a molecular weight
that was well above the upper-limit that can penetrate microbial
membranes. Jeon and Kim (2016) reported the functional
characteristics of alkane monooxygenases (AlkB1 and AlkB2)
from P. aeruginosa involved in LMWPE biodegradation and
found that the regulation mechanism of these enzymes was
diﬀerent, and that the AlkB2 enzyme was more eﬀective in
degrading LMWPE than the AlkB1 enzyme.
Danso et al. (2018) used Markov Model-based search strategy
to show that a surprisingly large variety of potential polyesterases
still needs to be discovered particularly in bacteria, which are
currently not considered as a prime source for cutinases (Danso
et al., 2018). The predominantly marine Pseudomonas lineage,
which includes halophilic, psychrophilic, hydrocarbonoclastic,
and heavy metal-tolerant species, is one such example; these
were found as a source for PU hydrolyzing enzymes (Wilkes and
Aristilde, 2017), while the Guebitz-group at the Austrian Centre
of Industrial Biotechnology, Austria revealed the polyesterase
activity in Pseudomonads (Haernvall et al., 2017; Wallace et al.,
2017). Polyesterase genes in Pseudomonas pertucinogena have
been conﬁrmed by sequence homology searches (Bollinger et al.,
2018). Further, many strains of Pseudomonas have been reported
to degrade a wide-range of recalcitrant compounds and/or
plastics such as PE, PS, PP , and PVC (Giacomucci et al., 2019).
CONCLUSION
Biodegradation of petroleum-derived polymers has been an
innovative area of research focused on solving plastic pollution in
the environment. This review has discussed the microorganisms
and enzymes reported to biodegrade these synthetic polymers.
Many strains of Pseudomonas and Bacillus have been observed to
degrade complex, recalcitrant compounds such as polyaromatic
hydrocarbons, and have been associated with the partial
degradation of a wide-range of petro-plastics, including PE, PS,
PP , PVC, PET and ester-based PU. The gut microbes in insects
have also been found to depolymerize PE, PS and PVC polymers.
Enzymes speciﬁcally associated with depolymerization of PET
and ester-based PU have been identiﬁed and intensively studied,
while enzymes that eﬀectively depolymerize PE, PP , PS, and PVC
have not yet been identiﬁed and characterized. Further analyses
of the genes and/or gene products (enzymes) that hydrolyze
the high molecular weight petro-plastic polymers may lead to
greater understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms
of biodegradation. Research focusing on digestive enzyme(s)
in plastic-degrading invertebrates and their gut microbes
could also lead to novel approach for plastic degradation,
especially for persistent non-hydrolyzable polymers. Based on
these knowledge, genetic engineering approaches to create
recombinant microbial strains and/or enzymes could be adopted
as the preferred strategy to enhance biodegradation of the
synthetic petroleum based plastic waste.
