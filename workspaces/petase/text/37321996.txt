Biocatalysis is a key technology enabling plastic recycling. However, despite
advances done in the development of plastic-degrading enzymes, the
molecular mechanisms that govern their catalytic performance are poorly
understood, hampering the engineering of more efﬁcient enzyme-based
technologies. In this work, we study the hydrolysis of PET-derived diesters and
PET trimers catalyzed by the highly promiscuous lipase B fromCandida
antarctica(CALB) through QM/MM moleculardynamics simulations sup-
ported by experimental Michaelis–Menten kinetics. The computational studies
reveal the role of the pH on the CALB regioselectivity toward the hydrolysis of
bis-(hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET). We exploit this insight to perform a
pH-controlled biotransformation that selectively hydrolyzes BHET to either its
corresponding diacid or monoesters using both soluble and immobilized
CALB. The discoveries presented here can be exploited for the valorization of
BHET resulting from the organocatalytic depolymerization of PET.
Plastic recycling is doubtless a realistic solution for the disposal of
plastics that contribute to their circularity (reducing the carbon
emissions of the plastic industry) and mitigating the plastic landﬁlling
that causes severe pollution. Current technologies to recycle plastics
are mainly based on mechanical and chemical methods. Great advan-
ces have been done in the chemical recycling of plastics yet the
depolymerization processes must be performed using highly pure
plastic waste feedstock as otherwise it is difﬁcult to produce highly
pure monomers that can be readily transformed into plastics with
similar properties to the virgin ones
1,2. In addition, the selective
depolymerization of plastics to polyfunctional molecules opens
upcycling pathways for plastic waste. For instance, heterofunctional
terephthalic moieties have shown enormous potential as redox-active
materials for energy storage devices
3. In this context, biocatalysis has
irrupted to degrade polymers more selectively into monomers that
can be either recycled to the original plastics or upcycled to other
building blocks to manufacture products with higher added value4.
The degradation of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) illustrates how
enzyme discovery and engineering have driven the success of bioca-
talysis on polymer degradation. Since the identiﬁcation of an efﬁcient
PET hydrolase in 2005 fromThermobiﬁda fusca

PET

the mesophilic bacteria Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6, can grow in
amorphous PET environments, degrading and using it as a carbon and
energy source
10,11. The study of this microorganism revealed a synergic
behavior of two enzymes, a PET hydrolase (IsPETase) and a mono(2-
hydroxyethyl) terephthalate hydrolase (IsMHETase). Isolation and
characterization of these two biocatalysts conﬁrmed that the former
was responsible for the chemical breakage of the polymer into

breaking of this molecule into ethylene glycol and terephthalate
(Fig. 1). More recently, Palm et al. have reported kinetic studies for the
hydrolysis of BHET and MHET withIsMHETase mutants, showing dif-
ferent activities depending on the speciﬁc variants

mixture.
We recently studied the reaction mechanism of the PET degra-
dation catalyzed by IsPETase and IsMHETase, as well as by the
metagenome-derived leaf-branch compost cutinase (LCC-ICCG
variant)
13 by computational methods with predicted rate constants in
agreement with the experimental observations14. Further analysis of
the structural changes ofIsPETase induced by PET binding15,a p p e a r s

The results derived from these computational studies represent the
bedrock to understanding the molecular mechanism that rules the
performance of PET degrading enzymes. Nevertheless, we poorly
understand the mechanism of other well-known ester hydrolases like
the highly promiscuous lipase B from Candida antartica B (CALB),
which can be a promising protein scaffold for the hydrolysis of
polyesters like PET
17.
CALB is a lipase that naturally hydrolyzes triacylglycerides, but it is
also capable to catalyze a plethora of chemical processes, including the
depolymerization of polyesters such as polylactic acid

hydrolysis of small PET oligomers20. Analysis of its active site reveals
the presence of a triad formed by Ser105-His224-Asp187 and the pre-
sence of an oxyanion hole formed by the residues Thr40 and Gln106
located at the substrate binding pocket. The hydrolytic mechanism of
CALB
21 is equivalent to the one proposed for the PET degradation
catalyzed byIsPETase, IsMHETase and LCC-ICCG13.W ek n o wt h a ta
suitable protonation state of the CALB active site is fundamental for its
amidase activity22, yet the effect of pH has never been investigated for
PET hydrolysis. Thus, although CALB has been scarcely employed for
degrading PET, we envision CALB as a promising chassis to design a
highly efﬁcient PETase due to its activity promiscuity to dismantle
other polyesters
17, its thermal stability, and our previous computa-
tional studies on the catalytic promiscuous activity of CALB21,23–25.
Furthermore, CALB tolerates organic solvents26,27 and ionic liquids28,
which may help the downstream and recovery of the PET hydrolytic
products. Moreover, Novozyme 435, the commercial immobilized
version of CALB is extremely robust and allows its recycling as
demonstrated for a wide variety of biotechnological applications
29–31.
In this work we present a computational study supported by
experimental data that reveal the unknown role of the pH on the CALB
selectivity toward either the full hydrolysis of bis-(hydroxyethyl) ter-
ephthalate (BHET) to terephthalic acid (TPA) and two molecules of
ethylene glycol (EG) or the partial hydrolysis of the same model sub-
strate to yield mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) and EG
(Fig. 1). We exploit the mechanistic insight to perform pH-controlled
biotransformation that selectively hydrolyzes BHET to either the dia-
cid or the monoester using both soluble and immobilized CALB. The
latter is re-used for up to eight cycles without altering its product
proﬁle at two extreme pHs. The potential of this pH-controlled bio-
transformation is illustrated by the valorization of BHET and small PET
oligomers resulting from the organocatalytic depolymerization of PET
to yield MHET, an intermediate that is very hard to achieve through
chemical methods under mild conditions (i.e., pH 7 and room tem-
perature). Transforming PET waste into monomers different from
virgin ones opens a myriad of possibilities to manufacture high-added
chemicals and contributes to implementing circular designs in the
plastic industry.
Results
BHET hydrolysis with selective product formation by pH
controlling
First, we studied the effect of pH during the hydrolysis of BHET cata-
lyzed by CALB. To that aim, we performed the time reaction courses
for the BHET hydrolysis at different pH conditions and the reaction
products were analyzed by UPLC-MS. In all cases, we used high con-
centrated corresponding buffer to maintain reaction pH along the
enzyme hydrolysis. The high ionic strength of the buffer negligibly
affects the enzyme activity (Supplementary Fig. 3a). Acidic conditions
(pH 5) lead to the hydrolysis of the two ester bonds forming BHET,
yielding TPA as the main product upon 8 h (Supplementary Figs. 3
and 4A). In contrast, neutral and alkaline pHs (7 and 9) lead to the
hydrolysis of only one ester of BHET, yielding MHET as the only
reaction product (Supplementary Figs. 3, 4B and 4C). Surprisingly, the
intermediate MHET was a poor substrate for the CALB at pH 9 and 7,
but an excellent substrate at pH 5. Blank experiments without the
enzyme conﬁrm that the spontaneous hydrolysis of BHET to either
MHET or TPA did not occur at pH 5 and 7, while it was signiﬁcant at pH
9. However, although at pH 9, BHET was spontaneously hydrolyzed to
MHET, the presence of CALB accelerates the selective hydrolysis of
one of the ester bonds of the substrate. CALB at pH 5 behaves similarly
to other esterases capable of hydrolyzing BHET
32,h o w e v e r ,t h i s
enzyme presents a unique selectivity for the monoesters at alkaline pH.
Therefore, these experimental data suggest that the selectivity of
CALB toward BHET is signiﬁcantly affected by the pH of the reaction
media. Hence, this pH modulation of CALB hydrolysis of BHET can be
exploited for the selective production of either TPA or MHET.
When we determined the Michaelis–Menten kinetic parameters
(K

(Table 1, Supplementary Fig. 5), we conﬁrmed the pH dependence of
the CALB substrate selectivity. We observed thatkcat values are similar
for BHET hydrolysis regardless of the pH of the reaction, however, the
higher the pH, the lower thek
cat for MHET hydrolysis. Regarding

the lipases fromCandida antarticaB (CALB) (right, this work). The selectivity of the

substrate afﬁnity, theKM of CALB toward both substrates, BHET and
MHET, follows the same trend;KM (pH 9) > (pH 5) > (pH 7). Therefore,
CALB hydrolyzes BHET more efﬁciently at pH 7 due to the combination
of the highestkcat and the lowestKM, unlike the hydrolysis of MHET
which is extremely slow (kcat of unless 1 order of magnitude lower) at
pH higher than 5, which precludes the formation of TPA at the neutral
and alkaline pH herein tested. Remarkably, CALB hydrolyzes BHET at
pH 7 as efﬁciently as MHET at pH 5, however, at pH 5 the rate-limiting
step was the hydrolysis of the diester. Hence, CALB prefers the diester
substrate at neutral pH while it does the monoester at an acid pH,
supporting the fact that TPA resulting from the two-consecutive
hydrolysis is accumulated only when the reaction pH is acidic.
MD simulations to estimate the protonation states of CALB:-
substrate complexes at different pH
According to the experimental data shown in Table1 and Supple-
mentary Fig. 3, CALB hydrolyzes the two esters bonds of BHET to yield
TPA and 2 molecules of EG under acidic conditions (pH 5), however,
this enzyme only hydrolyzes one of the esters of BHET to yield the
monoester MHET under alkaline conditions (pH 9). To ﬁnd out
the origin of this phenomenon, and keeping in mind the relevance of
the protonation state of the titratable residues in the intra-molecular
interactions and conformations of proteins, weﬁrst performed an
analysis of the pKa values of selected residues by using the empirical
program PropKa ver. 3.0 3
33 and by getting the full titratable curves
based on constant-pH non-equilibrium molecular dynamic and Monte
Carlo (neMD/MC) simulations34,35. According to the results derived
from both methods, residues Glu81, Asp134, Lys136 and Glu294 must
be protonated at pH 5, whereas they are all mostly deprotonated at pH
9( F i g .2a, b, and Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12). This must be obviously
related to local conformation changes of the protein (Fig.2c, d, and
Supplementary Figs. 13–16), but apparently without signiﬁcant effects
on the efﬁciency of CALB to hydrolyze BHET, according to our
experimental kinetics (see Table1). Interestingly, when making the
comparison between pH 5 and 7, the main difference appears in the
Glu81, which is protonated at pH 5 but deprotonated at pH 7. Lys136,
Glu294 and Asp134 do not change their protonation state from pH 5 to
7. Experimental data thus suggest that the protonation state of Glu81,
which is located more than 20 Å from the substrate, negligibly affects
the performance of CALB toward theﬁrst hydrolysis of BHET.

protonation states of the titratable residues showed signiﬁcant dif-
ferences. First, it is conﬁrmed that the different protonation state of
Glu81 makes some changes in the interaction network with the
neighbor residues by changing the relative orientation of their
side chains (Supplementary Fig. 15), an effect that is also observed in
the case of Glu294 and Lys136 (Supplementary Figs. 13 and 14). More
importantly, it appears that the protonation state of Asp134 triggers
the rearrangement of the H-bond interaction network between BHET
and the CALB active site (Figs.2c, d and Supplementary Fig. 16). Thus,
the carboxylic group of Asp134 at pH 5 forms a hydrogen bond with the
carbonyl group of Gln157 that establishes a hydrogen bond network
with Thr138 through the -NH groups of the backbone, and with Thr40.
These interactions contribute to the formation of the oxyanion hole
that anchors the substrate to the active site. In contrast, the ionic form
of Asp134 at pH 9 creates a completely different hydrogen bond net-

Gln157 through a water molecule (Fig.2c). These conformational
changes do not signiﬁcantly affect the distance and angle of the
nucleophilic attack between the reactive Ser105 and the substrate
(Fig. 2d). Nevertheless, there is an effect on the relative position
between Ser105 and His224, that can compromise the proton transfer
required to activate the catalytic Ser105 (Fig.2e). Thus, while the
average distance between the proton of Ser105 and the Nε2a t o mo f
His224 is ca. 2.0 Å at pH 5, this value increases to ca. 4.5 Å at pH 9. In
contrast, the distance between the deprotonated Asp134 and Ser105 is
reduced from 5.5 to 1.9 Å. These changes in the conformation of the
active site do not provoke a diminution of the catalytic activity of CALB
in degrading BHET, as experimentally demonstrated, thus suggesting a
plasticity of the enzyme that allows“conformational” promiscuity.
Regarding the substrate, it is expected that the protonation state
of hydroxyl groups of BHET did not change in the full range of different
working pHs, and the same could be applied to the MHET since the pK

the substrate conﬁguration within the active site and its local
environment
36. However, keeping in mind that this range is close to
pH 5, a non-negligible population of the available MHET substrate
could be protonated under acidic conditions. Hence, we assumed the
carboxylic group of MHET is negatively charged at pH 9 (MHET
(−)), but
we tested a protonated and negatively charged state at pH 5 (MHET and
MHET
(−), respectively). Results of MD simulations performed at the two
limit pHs with the different protonation states of the previously com-
mented residues and MHET are shown in Fig.3 and Supplementary
Movies 1 and 2, where the time evolution of the distance between the
center of mass of MHET and the center of mass of the oxyanion hole of
the active site at different pHs is shown. The results have shown the
diffusion of MHET to the bulk at pH 9, but not at pH 5, independent of
whether the substrate is considered neutral or negatively charged.
Then, we monitored the interactions between the substrate (BHET or
the negatively charged MHET) and the active site residues at both pHs
(Supplementary Figs. 17 and 18) to carry out a deeper analysis. The
interaction energies between MHET and CALB decomposed by resi-
dues show that the deprotonated Asp134 at pH 9 promotes the
repulsion of the substrate in the Michaelis complex, which is not
observed in the CALB:BHET complex. The interaction energy between
Asp134 and the substrate is much more negative (more stabilizing) at
pH 5 than at pH 9. The negative charges located on Asp134 and MHET
promote the repulsion of the substrate from the active site at pH 9. In
contrast, acidic conditions (pH 5) let the substrate form part of the
interaction network that sustainsa productive conformation of the
active site. The differences in the interactions of the rest of the residues
at the two tested pHs are negligible. This analysis of the interaction
energies calculated at the two different pH values agrees with the
r e s i d e n c et i m eo ft h es u b s t r a t ei nt h ea c t i v es i t ed u r i n gu n c o n s t r a i n t
MD simulations, as discussed above. Thus, MD analysis suggests a
relevant role of the Asp134 ultimately to bind MHET. In summary, a
negatively charged Asp134 prevents the formation of the Michaelis
complex for the hydrolysis reaction of MHET to TPA and EG, explaining
why the hydrolysis of the intermediate MHET is precluded at pH 9,
which halts the enzymatic process in theﬁrst ester hydrolysis of BHET
accumulating MHET. In order to provide additional support to this
hypothesis, we have carried out MD simulations of the MHET in the
active site of an Asp134Ala variant.The results show how the repulsion
established between the negatively charged Asp134 and deprotonated
MHET
(−) at pH 9 in the wild-type enzyme vanishes in the new variant.
Mutation of Asp134 to Ala restores the favorable interactions between
MHET
(−) and the active site, and therefore the substrate remains in the
pocket during the unconstrained MD simulations, thus conﬁrming the
role of the negatively charged Asp134 in preventing the binding of
MHET at pH 9 (Supplementary Fig. 19). Remarkably, our computational
results align with the experimental Michaelis–Menten parameters that
show how the K
M toward MHET at pH 5 was signiﬁcantly lower
(23.8 ± 8.8 mM) than at pH 9 (>100 mM) (Table1). In fact, CALB did not
reach the substrate saturation plateau when MHET was used as sub-
strate and the reaction was performed at pH 9.
QM/MM study of the hydrolysis of BHET catalyzed by CALB
The observed dramatic unfavorable effect on the binding of MHET at
pH 9 indicates that the substrate will hardly bind the active site at this
pH, and the virtually equivalent activation free energies derived from
the experimentally determined rate constants of the hydrolysis of
BHET and MHET at pH 5, as listed in Table1 (17.8 vs 17.3 kcal·mol
−1),
suggests we focus on exploring the free energy landscape corre-
sponding to the hydrolysis of BHET catalyzed by CALB at pH 5 and pH
9. However, in order to conﬁrm the hypothesis of equivalent reaction

mechanisms for the hydrolysis of BHET and MHET, free energy sur-
faces (FESs) were explored not only with BHET at the two pH values,
but with MHET at pH 5, conditions under which the reaction is feasible
as suggested by the experimental data (Supplementary Figs. 20 and
22). First of all, the results conﬁrm that the hydrolysis, independently
of whether the substrate is BHET or MHET, takes place in four steps, as
originally predicted based on the previous studies of the hydrolase and
amidase activity of CALB performed in our laboratory
22,23,25. The FESs of
MHET hydrolysis (Supplementary Fig. 22) are virtually the same as
those for the hydrolysis of BHET (Supplementary Figs. 20 and 21).
Focusing on the hydrolysis of BHET, theﬁrst two steps involve the
formation of the acyl-enzyme complex and the formation of an EG
molecule, where the deprotonated hydroxyl group of the Ser105
activated by His224 attacks the carbonyl of BHET. At this point, EG is
formed as leaving group and the acyl-enzyme complex is ready for the
hydrolysis step. Next, a water molecule activated by the catalytic
His224 attacks the carbonyl carbon forming a tetrahedral inter-
mediate. Finally, the His224-assisted hydrogen reshufﬂing triggers the
resolution of the acyl-enzyme complex that is followed by the forma-
tion of MHET as aﬁnal product to regenerate the CALB active site
ready to start a new catalytic cycle. A list of coordinates for the
structures of all states appearing along the reaction at the two pH
values optimized at QM/MM level, with the QM atoms treated at
density functional theory (DFT) level, is provided in Supplementary
Tables 5 and 6.
Figure4 shows the free energy proﬁles for the hydrolysis of BHET
at pH 5 and 9 (see Supplementary Table 4 for a list of relative energies).
Here, we can observe that the kinetics of theﬁrst ester hydrolysis of
BHET is limited in both cases by the hydrolysis step. In particular, the
rate-limiting step is determined by TS4, giving total activation free
energy values of 18.0 and 17.1 kcal·mol
−1 for the hydrolysis at pH 5
and 9, respectively. These predicted activation Gibbs free energies,
which can be considered indistinguishable considering the uncer-
tainty associated with the computational method, agree with the
experimental values, 17.8 and 17.6 kcal·mol
−1, that can be derived by
applying the Transition State Theory37 to the previously measured rate
constants (see Table1). Interestingly, the energetic data derived from
the FESs corresponding to the hydrolysis of MHET render a value of
the free energy of activation of the rate-limiting step of 18.3 kcal·mol−1,
very close to those for the hydrolysis of BHET and in agreement with
the indistinguishable kinetic data. The mechanistic and kinetic
description of the process agrees with previous studies on the reac-
tivity of CALB
23,38 and Bacillus subtilisBs222,25 where we noticed that the
rate-determining step of the overall reaction is controlled by the
hydrolysis step. It is interesting to point out that, in agreement with
the geometrical analysis of the Michaelis complexes discussed above,
the free energy barriers for the acylation step under alkaline condi-
tions are clearly higher than those under acidic conditions (13.4 vs
9.3 kcal·mol
−1). This means that, despite the conformational pro-
miscuity of the active site, the relative orientation of the substrate and
the active site at pH 5 is more reactive than the one at pH 9. Obviously,
because the acylation step is not determining the kinetics of the
overall process, this difference in the energy barriers is not reﬂected in
different k
cat values (0.52 ± 0.07 vs 0.73 ± 0.25 s−1 at pH 5 and 9,
respectively, as shown in Table1). However, this computational pre-
diction supports the experimentally determined lowerKM at pH 5 than
a pH 9 (22.5 ± 9.6 vs 61.0 ± 25.7 mM, respectively, as shown in Table1).
As observed in our previous studies on reactions catalyzed by
CALB23,25, the product of the acylation step in all the two reactions
(INT2 in Fig.4)i ss t a b i l i z e db yc o m p a r i s o nw i t ht h er e a c t a n tc o m p l e x
(−9.7 and −11.5 kcal·mol−1). This effect may be partially due to the
electrostatic stabilization of the acyl-enzyme complex. The develop-
ment of higher densities of charges in key atoms of the substrate in
intermediate 2, by comparison with the reactant complex, can explain
a higher stabilization of this state, at both pHs (Supplementary
Table 7).
pH-controlled CALB hydrolysis of BHET and PET oligomers
resulting from the chemical depolymerization of PET
PET polymer was depolymerized following the method previously
described by Jehano et al.39 NMR spectrum revealed that the major
depolymerization product was BHET (hitherto named crude BHET).
Encouraged by the performance of CALB to selectively hydrolyze only
one or the two ester bonds of BHET depending on the reaction pH, we
hydrolyzed the crude BHET at pH 5 and 9 to selectively yield TPA and
MHET, respectively. The resulting products were analyzed by UPLC-MS
and
1H-NMR. Figure5a, b shows the reaction time course of crude
BHET at pH 5 and 9. As expected, CALB transformed the BHET crude
into TPA in just 8 h negligibly accumulating the intermediate MHET. In
contrast, at pH 9, we observed that the only product formed was MHET
as its enzymatic hydrolysis was precluded under these conditions.
NMR studies conﬁrmed that at pH 5 the only hydrolysis product was
TPA, while MHET appears when the reaction was performed at 9 with
traces of TPA though (Supplementary Figs. 6 and 8). We found the
same selectivity switch when a PET trimer coming from the depoly-
merization process was submitted to CALB hydrolysis at pH 5 and pH
9. Under acidic conditions, TPA was majorly detected as a monomer
unlike alkaline conditions where the major product was MHET (Sup-
plementary Fig. 9). The titers of MHET and TPA (1–4 mM) using the PET
trimer as starting material were lower than using BHET due to the poor
solubility of the PET trimer in the reaction media (Supplementary
Fig. 9A–D). Hence, the accessibility of CALB to the unsoluble PET tri-
mer is limited, which explains the lower hydrolysis yield. Upon 24 h of
reaction,
1H-NMR analysis reveals that the trimer is majorly detected in
the unsoluble fraction regardless of the reaction pH, unlike the TPA (at
pH 5) and MHET (at pH 9) that are selectively accumulated in the
soluble fractions (Supplementary Fig S9E–H). The presence of ethy-
lene glycol in the NMR also supports the hydrolytic activity of CALB
over the PET oligomer. Hence, the selective production of either TPA
or MHET from a depolymerization crude opens an avenue to revalorize
plastic wastes through chemo-enzymatic methods where chemical
catalysts depolymerize plastic polymer into small oligomers that
are valorized by the action of the enzyme into monomers that can
be upcycled into other products. For example, TPA can be used as
a carbon source for the microbial fermentation of poly-
hydroxyalkanoates (PHAs) and polycathecols
32,40–42 and the chemical
production of virgin-like PET. Alternatively, MHET can be further
upcycled into new materials taking advantage of the orthogonal
functionality of the hydroxy and carboxylic groups. In fact, the com-
plementary functionality of these monomers eases their further che-
mical transformations, increasing their purity and reducing the

number of potential side reactions without generating a signiﬁcant
amount of waste.
pH-controlled hydrolysis ofBHET catalyzed by immobi-
lized CALB
Motivated by these excellent results obtained with soluble CALB, we
investigated if the pH control of the hydrolysis was maintained when
using an immobilized formulation of CALB. To that aim, we used the
commercial preparation of CALB immobilized on polymethacrylate
beads (Novo435®). As expected, MHET could only be obtained when
the reaction was performed at pH 9, while TPA was achieved operating
the reaction at pH 5 (Fig.5c, d). Therefore, the immobilization of CALB
does not affect its reaction selectivity under different pH conditions.
Moreover, the immobilized preparation maintains both, its original
activity and reaction product proﬁle during 8 reaction cycles. These
results point out the suitability of CALB as an industrial biocatalyst for
the degradation of PET oligomers with unprecedented substrate
selectivity by simple pH control.
Discussion
In summary, we propose a selectivity switch for the formation of either
MHET or TPA from BHET by CALB by modulating the pH conditions,
through classical and QM/MM MD simulations combined with
experimental Michaelis–Menten kinetics. Our results show how the
ionization state of CALB under acidic conditions forms a neutral
hydrogen bond network that enables the binding of both the
uncharged initial substrate BHET and the negatively charged inter-
mediate MHET, explaining its capacity to perform the double hydro-
lysis of the former under acidic conditions. In contrast, the MHET
anion together with the ionization state of several residues of the
protein, including Asp134 at pH >7, destabilizes the CALB:MHET
complex avoiding its hydrolysis and explaining the selective hydrolysis
of one out of the two ester bonds of BHET. The exploration of the QM/
MM free energy landscape of the hydrolysis of BHET, at pH 9 and pH 5,
allows for obtaining a detailed description of this enzyme-catalyzed
multistep chemical reaction. Conformational changes taking place in
the active site as the result of the different protonation states of
titratable residues inﬂuence the barrier of the acylation step, but not
the rate-limiting hydrolysis step. Computational results were sup-
ported by experimental Michaelis–Menten kinetics of CALB at differ-
ent pH conditions, with activation free energies of the rate-limiting
step following the same trend as the experimentally determined rate
constants. Finally, we exploited the pH-controlled hydrolysis to
transform BHET and PET trimers resulting from the chemical depoly-
merization of PET into individual monomers such as either TPA or
MHET depending on the reaction pH. We conﬁrmed that the product
proﬁle at the two different pHs was maintained even using an immo-
bilized preparation of CALB. The results we present here open avenues
for the exploitation of CALB in polymer recycling and upcycling. The
herein-discovered selectivity of CALB allows us to use, but also re-use,

the same biocatalysts to prepare either diacids or monoacids from
diesters and PET trimers, and eventually from polyesters. Biocatalytic
tools, such as the one presented in this work, forecast pathways to
recycle, but also upcycle, plastic wastes upon the chemical depoly-
merization process. Furthermore, we forecast that more chemo/
enzymatic approaches like the one herein presented will be deployed
in the short term to make plastic recycling industrially appealing.
Methods
Materials
Soluble lipase B fromCandida antarcticaLipozyme® and its immo-
bilized preparation Novozym435® were acquired from Novozymes
(Denmark). Substrates and reaction products, bis(2-hydroxyethyl)
terephthalate (BHET), terephthalic acid (TPA); chemicals and sol-
vents, 2-4-morpholinepropanesulfonic acid (MOPS), sodium acetate
anhydrous, sodium phosphate, sodium bicarbonate, dimethyl sulf-
oxide, acetonitrile were acquired from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, IL).
Precision plus proteinTM standards and Bradford reagent were
acquired from BIORAD. All other reagents and solvents were analy-
tical grade or superior.
Protein quantitation
The protein content of solubleCandida antarctica Lipozyme® was
determined by SDS-PAGE gel electrophoresis by employing a broad
range of protein molecular weight markers (Promega) (Supplemen-
tary Fig. 1).
Enzyme activity measurements
Enzyme activities were spectrophotometrically measured in transpar-
ent 96-well microplates, employing a Microplate Reader Epoch 2,
BioTek® with the software Gen5.
Lipase activity was indirectly monitored by the decrease in the
pH triggered by the TPA formation from total BHET hydrolysis.
Brieﬂy, 200μL of a reaction mixture containing BHET (at the required
concentration), 10% acetonitrile, and 0.25 mM p-nitrophenol in
25 mM MOPS buffer at pH 7.2 were incubated with 5μL of enzymatic
solution or suspension (properly diluted) at 30 °C. The decrease in
the absorbance of p-nitrophenol (pH indicator) at 410 nm was
recorded. One unit of activity was deﬁned as the amount of enzyme
that was required to produce 1μmol TPA per minute at the assayed
conditions.
Depolymerization of PET
For this, 0.5 g of PETﬂakes were depolymerized by 20 eq. ethylene
glycol employing 0.5 eq of TBD:MSA as the catalyst. A 26 mL vial
equipped with a magnetic stirrer was used for all the reactions. The
depolymerizations were conducted under atmospheric pressure at
180 °C for 2 h until the complete disappearance of any residual PET.
Reagents and catalysts were loaded in the glovebox, under a nitrogen
atmosphere, before sealing theﬂask and immersion in a pre-heated oil
bath. After reaction completion, the crude was cooled down to room
temperature, and a large excess of distilled water was added. The
resulting mixture was vigorously stirred before beingﬁltered to
separate ethylene glycol, catalyst and main product from oligomers
which are insoluble in water. The aqueous transparentﬁltrate was
stored in a refrigerator at 4 °C overnight. After this, white needle-like
crystals were formed in the solution, which wereﬁltrated and dried. 1H
NMR characterization revealed that the collected crystals were highly
pure bis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (BHET) monomer with char-
acterizing data in accordance with commercially-supplied BHET
(Supplementary Fig. 2).
BHET and PET trimer hydrolysis
Either soluble or immobilized enzymes were placed inside a 2 mL
Eppendorf tube containing a reaction mixture (0.5 or 1.8 mL, as
indicated) consisting of 10 mM BHET or PET trimer, 10% DMSO in
100 mM buffered aqueous solution assuring the pH maintenance
during the whole hydrolysis reaction without detrimental effects on
CALB activity (sodium acetate for pH 5, sodium phosphate pH 7,
sodium bicarbonate for pH 9). Reactions were incubated at 25 °C at
250 rpm. The reaction course was monitored by withdrawing sam-
ples at periodic intervals using cellulose membrane tangential units
(10kDa MWCO) to remove the enzyme. Then, the samples were
analyzed by chromatographic methods and
1H-NMR. In the case of
the PET trimer, due to its solubility issues, the reaction crude was
centrifuged and the solid (precipitate) and the aqueous (super-
natant) fractions were separated. The solid fraction was solubilized
in pure DMSO and the soluble fraction was passed through the
cellulose membrane tangential units. The concentrations of sub-
strate (BHET), intermediate (MHET) and product (TPA) were
determined by UPLC-MS analysis at different time points. Prior
UPLC-MS analysis samples were diluted 5 times in 100 mM acetate
buffer to avoid BHET autohydrolysis at alkaline pHs. MHET and TPA
yields (%) were calculated MHET or TPA concentration at each
reaction time divided by the initial concentration of BHET and
multiplied by 100.
1H-NMR analysis
Prior NMR analysis reaction samples wereﬁltered through cellulose
membrane tangentialﬁltration units (10 kDa MWCO) and diluted 1.1
times with deuterated water.1H Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR).
1H-NMR spectroscopic measurements were carried out on a Bruker
Advance 400 (400 MHz) spectrometer. If needed, to improve spec-
trum quality water signal was suppressed by means of presaturation
experiments.
UPLC-MS analysis
Prior UPLC-MS analysis of reaction samples were properly diluted
(typically 10–20 times in acetonitrile/water mixture 30:70). The analysis
was performed in an Acquity UPLC system using an Acquity BEH C18
column (100 × 2.1 mm, 1.7µm) from Waters (Milford, MA, USA) and
equipped with a photodiode array detector (PDA). The gradient elution
mobile phases were A: 0.1% Formic acid in water, and B: acetonitrile. The
gradient method was: 0–1 min, isocratic at 90% A; 1–7m i n ,g r a d i e n tt o
50% A; 7–8.3 min, isocratic at 50% A; 8.3–8.5 min, gradient to 90% A,
8.5–10 min isocratic for stabilization at 90% A. The UV detector wave-
length was set at 245 nm and the injection volume was 2µL. The total
run time was 10 min with aﬂow rate of 300µL·min
−1. Retention times
were: TPA 1.97 min, MHET 2.92 min and BHET 3.41 min.
The mass spectrometry detection was carried out using a time-of-
ﬂight mass spectrometer (ESI-TOF) LCT Premier XE from Waters
(Milford, MA, USA) with an electrospray ionization source, working in
positive/V mode. The MS range acquired was between m/z 50–1.000.
The capillary and cone voltages were set at 3.000 and 50 V, respec-
tively. The desolvation gas temperature was 300 °C and the source
temperature was 120 °C. The desolvation gasﬂow was set at 600 L·h
−1
and cone gas ﬂow was set at 50 L·h−1. For quantiﬁcation and data
analysis, Masslynx v4.1 software was used (Waters, Milford, MA, USA).
The detection was carried out in positive and negative ions modes,
monitoring the most abundant isotope peaks from the mass spectra.
BHET (Mw: 254.24) and MHET (Mw: 210.18) were detected as proto-
nated molecules with m/z 255 and 211 respectively (positive ion mode),
whereas TPA (Mw: 166.13) was detected as a deprotonated molecule
with m/z 165 (negative ion mode).
Computational model setup
Wild-type Candida antarcticaLipase B (CALB) initial geometry was
taken from PDB structure 1TCA43. Three systems were prepared by
assigning the protonation state of titratable residues at pH equivalent
to 5 and 9 in agreement with pKa values determined by getting the full

titratable curves based on constant-pH hybrid neMD/MC simulations,
as implemented as a Tcl plugin,namdcph, for use in conjunction with
NAMD ver. 2.1244. The substrates BHET and MHET, in their neutral and
negatively charged state (MHET and MHET(−), respectively), were
manually built in the active site, with the oxygen of the carbonyl
properly placed in the oxyanion hole formed by Thr40 and Gln106.
Afterward, all missing hydrogen atoms were added to the structure,
and the system was solvated into a 100 × 80 × 80 Å
3 pre-equilibrated
box of TIP3P45 water molecules, and counterions were added to neu-
tralize the systems.
After initial energy minimizations, the systems were heated to
303 K with a 0.1 K temperature increment and equilibrated during
short (100 ps) NPT MD simulations, followed by non-accelerated
classical 100 ns NVT MD simulations with AMBER forceﬁeld
46,a s
implemented in NAMD software. During the 100 ns of NVT MD simu-
lations, all atoms were free to movewithin periodic boundary condi-
tions (PBC) and cut-offs for nonbonding interactions with an internal
cut-off of 14.5 Å and an external of 16 Å. In order to avoid diffusion of
the substrate, a restraint in the position between the oxygen of the
carbonyl and the oxyanion hole was applied. The constant tempera-
ture was maintained using a Langevin thermostat
47. See Supplemen-
tary Methods for more details.
Free energy surfaces (FESs)
FESs were obtained, in terms of two-dimensional potential mean force
(2D-PMF)
48, for every step of the reaction using the Umbrella Sampling
(US) approach48,49 combined with the Weighted Histogram Analysis
Method (WHAM)50, at the two selected pH. Structures obtained in
previously computed PESs were used as starting points for the MD
simulations in every window. Due to the cost of the sampling of the
system at every window, the PMFs were initially generated with the QM
region treated at the AM1
51 level. The OPLS-AA52 and TIP3P classical
force ﬁelds were used to treat the protein and the solvent water
molecules, respectively, as implemented in the fDynamo library53.
Then, in order to improve lower quality results associated with the low-
level semiempirical calculations, high-level two-dimensional spline
function corrections were applied using the M06-2X density
functional
54, with the standard 6-31+G(d,p) basis set, as implemented
in Gaussian 09 program55. Structures of key states involved in the
reactions were optimized at M06-2X/MM level. See Supplementary
Methods for details.
