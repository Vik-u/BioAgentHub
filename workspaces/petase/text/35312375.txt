Engineered and native enzymes are poised to solve challenges in medicine, bioreme-
diation, and biotechnology. One important goal is the possibility of upcycling poly-
mers using enzymes. However, enzymes are often inactive in industrial, nonbiological
conditions. It is particularly difficult to protect water-soluble enzymes at elevated
temperatures by methods that preserve their functionality. Through atomistic and
coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations that capture protein conformational
change, we show that an enzyme, PETase (polyethylene terephthalate [PET]), can
be stabilized at elevated temperatures by complexation with random copolymers into
nanoscaleaggregatesthatdonotprecipitateintomacroscopicphases.Wedemonstrated
the efficiency of the method by simulating complexes of random copolymers and the
enzyme PETase, which depolymerizes PET, a highly used polymer. These polymers are
more industrially viable than peptides and can target specific domains on an enzyme.
We design the mean composition of the random copolymers to control the polymer–
enzyme surface contacts and the polymer conformation. When positioned on or near
the active site, these polymer contacts can further stabilize the conformation of the
active site at elevated temperatures. We explore the experimental implications of this
active site stabilization method and show that PETase-random copolymer complexes
have enhanced activity on both small molecule substrates and solid PET films. These
results provide guidelines for engineering enzyme–polymer complexes with enhanced
enzyme functionality in nonbiological environments.

Enzymes have the potential to tremendously impact the fields of pharmacology
(1,2),biotechnology(3),andbioremediation(4).Theyareespeciallyusefulforupcycling
plastics (5), which are currently polluting oceans (6–8) and freshwater supplies harming
both humans (9) and animals (10, 11). Enzymes such as lipases (12), cutinases (13,
14), hydrolases (15), and cytochrome P450 (16, 17) can catalyze a growing number of
reactionsduetoadvancesinenzymeengineering(17,18).Inadditiontoengineeringnew
catalytic functions, attempts have been made to increase enzyme efficiency by creating
multienzyme complexes (19, 20), immobilizing them on two-dimensional surfaces (3,
16, 21–23), embedding them in plastics (4), and modifying the amino acid composition
of enzymes to increase their thermal stability (24, 25). Stabilizing these enzymes is
crucial for applications in nonbiological conditions such as elevated temperatures and
pressures. Here, we investigate how complexation with random copolymers can enhance
the high-temperature stability of the enzyme PETase (polyethylene terephthalate [PET])
(26), which degrades PET. PET is a glassy polymer at room temperature. Therefore,
for PETase to function effectively, the temperature should be raised aboveT
g (70 ◦C)
(27), which would normally denature the enzyme. Our simulations demonstrate the
relationship between polymer composition and protein–polymer structure as well as
the spatial correlations between chemically different monomers and the heterogeneous
protein surface. We then show how the structure of the protein–polymer complex can
impact the catalytic function of the enzyme, especially at elevated temperatures. Finally,
we provide experimental verification of this enhanced catalytic activity of PETase in the
presence of random copolymers.
Charged polymers have been used to encapsulate and stabilize proteins through either
macroscopic segregation (28, 29) or microphase separation into nanoscale aggregates
that do not precipitate into macroscopic phases (15, 30, 31). This approach works on
a wide variety of proteins including engineered proteins with nonbiological functions
(17, 32), because protein–polymer interactions can be altered in many ways to enhance
complexation (33, 34) including by modifying the charge of the proteins themselves
(35, 36). Phase separation through engineering protein charge distribution has also been
demonstrated in vivo (37) in cellular bodies known as membraneless organelles (38)
(MLOs). MLOs are composed of proteins, nucleic acids, and small molecule metabolites
(39) and are often formed from intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) or proteins
with intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs). IDPs control the MLO composition based

on specific interactions that originate from the IDP sequence
(40) and this spatial organization helps to regulate the internal
biochemistry of cells. Inspired by IDPs, we design a microphase
separated protein–polymer complex using random copolymers.
These random copolymers contain monomers with a common
backbone but different side chains that can be polar, nonpo-
lar, or charged. The monomers, shown in Fig. 1D and E,a r e
oligo-ethyl glycol methacrylate with a length of nine ethyl glycol
units(OEGMA-9),ethylhexylmethacrylate(EHMA),andsulfo-
propyl methacrylate (SPMA). Due to their methyl methacrylate
backbone, they are inexpensive to randomly polymerize in large-
scale, industrial processes. They have also been used in previous
computational and experimental studies of polymer complexes
withproteinsincludinghorseradishperoxide,glucoseoxidase,and
organophosphorus hydrolase as well as small organic molecules
(32,41).Further,amphiphilicrandomcopolymersarewellsuited
to complex with the heterogeneous polar and nonpolar surfaces
of proteins (42) including PETase. Thus, in addition to the
electrostaticattractionbetweenthepolymerandprotein,thepolar
andnonpolargroupsoftherandomcopolymerscanself-optimize
(43),maximizingtheirinteractionswithproteinsurfacedomains,
making this complexation quite general (32, 42, 44).
In the present study, we explore how complexation with ran-
dom copolymers can affect the conformation, and thus the func-
tion, of PETase especially at temperatures the enzyme does not
experience in vivo. We achieve this by varying the mean polymer
composition, which controls the polymer–protein surface inter-
actions. This, in turn, affects complex formation and the spatial
distributionofcontactsonthesurfaceoftheenzyme.Whilethere
havebeenpreviousstudiesofprotein–polymercomplexation(33,
45), experimental studies are inherently limited in the direct ob-
servation of surface correlations (46) and previous computational
studies have used coarse models that did not include charges
(42) or vary the mean composition (32). Other models (47)
were used to study PETase and cytochrome P450 in the context
of macroscopic complexes instead of nanoscale complexes and
they were also unable to study the effect of the polymers on the
conformationoftheenzymeactivesite,whichweshowisaffected
by the spatial distribution of protein–polymer contacts at both
room and elevated temperatures. Specifically, we demonstrate
that when these PETase-random copolymer complexes have an
abundance of polymer-active site contacts, they can have less
perturbed active sites than the protein by itself and remain stable
as the temperature is increased.
1. Results and Discussion
A.PETaseStructureatElevatedTemperature. PETasedenatures
as temperature is increased, leading to detectable decreases in
activity above room temperature (24, 25). In Fig. 2A, all-atom
molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate the deformation of
the active site at elevated temperatures. We use protein rmsd
(48) to measure the conformation of the protein relative to the
energy-minimized crystal structure, not including rotational or
translationaldiffusion.Wemeasuretheconformationofthewhole
protein as well as the active site using a previously published
definition of the seven active site residues (26). This provides
metrics for the behavior of the whole protein and the active site,
whoseconformationrelativetothecrystalstructurecorrelateswith
enzymatic activity (49).
As shown in Fig. 2A, there is an upward trend for both the
whole protein and active site rmsd values as the temperature
increases and PETase activity decreases. The active site rmsd at
330 K is an outlier—despite decreasing from 320 K, it is still
higherthan298or310K.Inagreementwithstudieshighlighting
the flexibility of the active site (49), we see that the active site
is more perturbed by increases in temperature (especially at the

the following sections where random copolymers complex with

PETase also shows an upward trend for both rmsd values with
temperature as well as larger increases for the active site than for
thewholeprotein.Althoughthermsdvaluesaredifferentbetween
the atomistic and GoMartini models, they are also measured on
different time scales, 10 ns for the atomistic results and 300 ns
fortheGoMartiniresults(see SI Appendix, Materials and Methods
for more details), with longer times potentially leading to further
perturbation of the protein structure. The ability to access these
longertimescalesisagreatadvantageoftheGoMartinimodel.In

sitermsddecreasesinsteadofincreasing.Here,themodelisfailing
to accurately predict the active site behavior of PETase, although
the whole protein rmsd displays the correct trend. Despite this
issue, the GoMartini model still provides a baseline that can be
compared to the case of polymer complexation to evaluate the
abilityofthepolymerstostabilizetheactivesite.Thisissueisalso
mitigated by restricting our analysis of the active site to 320 K in
some cases (see Fig. 6C).

FH compositions that lead to globular polymer conformations
(Fig. 3C). Thus, the wrapped conformation of the lowFH ran-

access the protein surface, leading to more hydrophobic and total
protein–polymer contacts. The connectivity of the hydrophobic
backboneandhydrophobicglobularconformationsseemstolead
to the creation of contacts with both the polar and hydropho-
bic parts of the protein as shown by the weaker hydrophobic
correlations between polymer and protein (Fig. 4B). The polar
correlations are stronger, possibly due to reduced connectivity of
the polar side chains and the ability to interact with the aqueous
solvent instead of the protein surface. We note this analysis is
highly sensitive to how the hydrophobicity of different beads is
defined (SI Appendix, sections B.3 and C.3).

Experimentshavealsodemonstratedthatproteinchargedomains
are crucial in macrophase behavior of protein–polyelectrolyte
complexes (29, 45). This is also true of polymer blockiness (51–
53), or the tendency of like monomers to be grouped together
in the polymer sequence, in phase separation of polyelectrolyte
complexes especially as ionic conditions are varied (54–56).

andtheactivesite.Thesermsdvaluesareameasureoftheprotein
conformation relative to the PETase crystal structure with lower
values representing less perturbed active sites and thus a more
active enzyme.
We find that the random copolymers are very effective at pre-
venting PETase from deforming as the temperature is increased.
This is shown by the rmsd values for the active site and the whole
protein averaged over all polymer compositions and compared
withtheresultsforPETasewithoutpolymers(Fig.2 B).Thermsd
values as a function of temperature with polymers bound are al-
mostflatforthewholeproteinandtheactivesite;theactualvalues
for the active site and the whole protein are only slightly greater
than those for the protein alone at 298 K. The perturbations
caused by polymer binding are less than the perturbations seen at
elevatedtemperaturesasat320K.Thus,thestabilityoftheactive
site is much improved with the addition of polymers. The distri-
bution of active site rmsd values at 320 K shows that for nearly
every polymer composition the active site rmsd is lower than that
without polymers (SI Appendix,F i g .S 3A). The rmsd values for
the active site also have a much broader range when compared to
the values of the whole protein (SI Appendix,F i g .S 3B). Further,
this range includes some active site rmsd values that are lower
at room temperature with polymers than without. This wide
range of rmsd values for the active site is not well explained by
trends in mean polymer composition (SI Appendix,F i g .S 4). To
explain the wide range of active site behavior we look at the
location of the contacts for those compositions where active sites
arelessperturbedthanthePETasealoneatroomtemperatureand
compare to compositions where active sites are more perturbed
than the PETase alone at room temperature (Fig. 6). We find
that less perturbed compositions have significantly more contacts
near or on the active site of the enzyme at both 298 K (Fig. 6C)
and 320 K (Fig. 6D). This suggests that contacts on the active
site stabilize instead of perturb the active site. Thus, although
we found a correlation between polymer contacts on the positive
section of the enzyme and mean polymer composition in Fig. 5,
these contacts were not concentrated on the active site, which
explains the absence of correlation between mean polymer com-
position and active site conformation (SI Appendix,F i g .S 4). In
other words, the composition of the polymers (especially charge)
biases the spatial distribution of contacts, but it does not bias
these contacts to the active site, where they provide stability. This
does not necessarily have to be the case for PETase or any given
enzyme, since previous work has shown that complexation can
be influenced by engineering the net charge on various proteins
(35, 36). A similar strategy could be used to change the charge
distributionneartheactivesite.Thus,wesuggestthatengineering

general,previousstudieshaveillustratedthattheadditionofpoly-
merstoenzymescanenhancetheactivityatelevatedtemperatures
in water (15, 57), suggesting the phenomenon extends beyond
PETase. Moreover, most active sites are partially hydrophobic
(58–61), suggesting that polymers with hydrophobic groups can
stabilize the active site with local contacts as shown here.
D. Activity of Enzyme–Polymer Complexes on Small Molecule
and Solid Substrates.We performed experiments to assess the
impact of active site stabilization on enzyme activity. We first
examinedthetemperaturesatwhichourPETase/copolymercom-
plexes are stable. We incubated PETase or PETase/copolymer
mixtures at a range of temperatures (4 to 50
◦C )f o r1ha n d
assayed esterase activity at room temperature against the small
molecule substrate, p-nitrophenyl acetate (Fig. 7A). Here, we
used a small molecule substrate to avoid confounding effects of
temperature on PETase’s PET degrading activity (an established
phenomenon) (24, 25). The copolymer used in these studies has

Interestingly, we found that for all incubation temperatures, the
specific esterase activity of PETase was enhanced in the presence
of copolymer and that this activity enhancement increased at
highercopolymerconcentrations(Fig.7 A).Ourdataalsoindicate
that PETase activity in PETase/copolymer complexes is stable
at temperatures up to 40
◦C. Notably, this is less than the
glass transition temperature of PET (70◦C). While the activity
enhancement with the addition of copolymer could improve the
utility of the enzyme, further thermal stabilization of the PETase
enzymeislikelyneededtorealize thefullpotentialofthissystem.

activesiteconformation,thusalteringPETaseactivity.Weobserve
a wide distribution of active site conformations in simulations
in the presence of copolymer compared to the naked enzyme
(Fig. 2C). While some of these active site conformations may
be less active than the native enzyme, we hypothesize that there
may be a few active conformations present at any given time
that confer substantially higher enzyme activity. An alternative
hypothesis is that the random copolymers interact favorably with
the substrate, leading to an increase in local substrate concentra-
tion. Indeed, it has been shown that these random copolymers
can bind hydrophobic small molecules (41) and that IDRs in
proteins, similar to the random copolymers in Fig. 4B,p r o m o t e
higher-order assembly (62). However, because the increase in
PETase activity appears to be independent of substrate (solid
PET or aqueous p-nitrophenyl acetate), it is more likely that the
interactionsresponsibleforthisactivityenhancementarebetween
the PETase and the random copolymer rather than the random
copolymer and the substrate.
2. Conclusions and Outlook
Theabilitytousevarioustypesofenzymesinindustrialconditions
could dramatically impact biotechnology, pharmacology, and
bioremediation. Here, we show the following: 1) PETase is
functionally stabilized by complexation with industrially scalable
random copolymers. We demonstrate this through simulations
of whole protein and active site conformations and using
experiments measuring enzyme activity in response to thermal
challenge. 2) This effect is further enhanced when random
copolymers form more contacts with the enzyme active site.
3) Polymer composition biases the conformation and location of
the random copolymers on a protein despite the randomness of
the polymer sequences. Thus, engineering the surface potential
of the protein, using standard protein mutation or modification
techniques, could bias polymers to bind near the active site,
further increasing enzyme activity. This approach may be
compatible with a variety of enzymes as long as their surfaces can
beengineeredwithoutmisfolding.However,theuseofcopolymer
complexation to modify active site conformation does not
necessitatefurtherproteinmutationormodificationasthediverse
functional groups on the copolymer should permit binding to a
varietyofproteinsurfaces.Further,thisapproachcanalsobeused
in the absence of information on the sequence and structure of
an enzyme. Thus, this strategy has the potential to be a widely
accessible route to increasing enzyme functionality, especially
given that it requires only a random polymerization. Future
experiments using substrates with various physical properties
could elucidate the role of interactions between substrates and
random copolymers, opening another avenue for engineering
enzyme activity via complexation with copolymers. These
interactionscouldbecontrolledbyusingmonomerswithspecific

PETase Activity on PET Films.PETase and PETase/random copolymer solu-
tions were prepared in 20-mL glass scintillation vials as described inSI Appendix.
To measure PET degradation, PET discs 0.2 mm thick and 1.27 cm in diameter
were submerged in the PETase-containing solutions and incubated at 35
◦Cf o r
1 to 5 h. MHET production in each vial was determined by measuring solution
absorbance at 242 nm. Further details can be found inSI Appendix.
