The escalating challenge of plastic waste necessitates innovative strategies that surpass conventional
mechanical recycling. This review examines recent advancements in plastic waste recycling
technologies, with a focus on three primary domains: chemical recycling, biological degradation, and
enhanced sorting techniques. Chemical recycling employs depolymerization and pyrolysis to dismantle
heterogeneous polymers into recoverable monomers, mitigating the constraints of mechanical methods
on mixed waste streams. Biological approaches utilize enzymes and microbial consortia for
environmentally benign degradation, with emerging engineered variants demonstrating eﬃcacy across
diverse polymer types. Furthermore, the integration of arti ﬁcial intelligence (AI) in sorting systems
enhances separation accuracy and throughput by up to 95%. Collectively, these developments foster
a robust, sustainable recycling infrastructure aligned with circular economy principles. Nonetheless,
barriers such as technological scalability, economic viability, and process optimization persist. This
analysis evaluates these innovations' potential to elevate recycling rates, minimize ecological harm, and
promote material circularity, while delineating principal obstacles and priority areas for future
investigation to facilitate commercial deployment.
1. Introduction
1.1 Background
The escalating dependence on plastics has precipitated
a profound environmental crisis, with profound implications
for human health and ecosystems. From 1950 to 2015, global
production reached 8300 million metric tonnes (Mt) of plastics,
of which merely 9% underwent recycling.
1 Approximately 12.7
million Mt of plastic waste entered oceans in 2010, a volume
projected to increase tenfold by 2025 absent enhanced
management practices.
2 Mismanaged waste such as litter, open
dumping, or unregulated land lling facilitates ingress into
natural environments.3 Over 80% of marine plastic pollution
originates from terrestrial sources, underscoring deciencies in
waste governance.4 Environmental fragmentation yields micro-
and nanoplastics, disseminatedvia uvial, oceanic, and atmo-
spheric pathways. These particulates bioaccumulate across
trophic levels, impairing marine biodiversity, and enter human
diets, with estimates suggesting weekly ingestion of 0.1–5 g per
individual equivalent to a credit card at the upper bound.
5
Although the health ramications remain incompletely eluci-
dated, accumulating evidence implicates microplastics in
pathogen vectoring, alongside toxicity from inherent additives,
sorbed contaminants, or polymer particulatesvia ingestion or
inhalation.
6
Urgent remediation of plastic mismanagement is imperative
to safeguard ecosystems and public health. The Global Plastic
Waste Management System (GPWMS) constitutes an intricate,
interdependent network wherein component inputs and
outputs exert reciprocal in uences. Fundamentally, the
GPWMS encompasses three phases: initial waste generation
(IWG), intermediate handling (including collection, recycling,
and the Plastic Waste Trade Network [PWTN]), and terminal
disposal ( e.g., land lling, incineration, or uncontrolled
release).
7 Recycling encompassing collection, material recovery,
and reprocessing varies by jurisdiction and technology, yet
garners substantial scholarly and policy emphasis as a corner-
stone of circular economies.
8 Notwithstanding, empirical recy-
cling stands at 9%, with scant evidence of displacement of
virgin production.
9 Displacement e ﬃcacy, de ned as the
quantity of virgin material averted per unit of recyclate, proves
elusive due to economic volatilities, behavioral factors, and
counterfactual estimation challenges.
10
Recycling entails a sequential cascade susceptible to attrition
at each juncture. While extant technologies augment eﬃcacy,
their aggregate potential to curtail virgin waste generation (VWG)

1.2 Importance of plastic waste recycling
Over the past 70 years, plastics have become incredibly common
in all sorts of structural and non-structural uses, catching the eye
of many industries. However, a major problem is that most
plastics made in the last 60 years don't break down naturally and
can take decades to decompose.
25 With a staggering 86% of
plastics ending up in landlls,20 a huge amount of plastic waste
has built up over time, creating waste management headaches
and environmental problems, like microplastics polluting oceans
and being ingested by humans and animals.
25 Ab i gr e a s o nf o rt h i s
mess is the heavy reliance on plastics meant to be thrown away
aer just one use. Instead of being single-use, plastics could be
recycled to make the most of the energy already used to produce
and distribute them.
26 That's why it's so important for designers to
think about recycling and create products that can be reused in
ways diﬀerent from their original purpose. Just to clarify, in this
paper, we use“thermoplastics” and “plastics” interchangeably to
refer only to polymers that can be melted and reshaped.
Plastic waste poses major hurdles for eﬀective recycling. In
the US, plastics account for about 12.9% of all municipal solid
waste.
27 Unlike metals, which are relatively easy to recycle,
plastics present unique challenges. They're used in a wide range
of products, with packaging and single-use items making up
roughly half of all plastic applications. Only about 20% to 25%
of plastics are used in long-lasting structures, mostly in
construction and building, while the rest go into medium-term
products like electronics, furniture, vehicles, and agricultural
items.
28 Plastic production includes various types: polyethylene
(PE) makes up 24%, polypropylene (PP) 16.6%, polyvinyl chlo-
ride (PVC) 11.4%, polyurethane (PU) 5.5%, polystyrene (PS)
6.1%, and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) 5.3%.
1 The mix of
diﬀerent plastics, combined with contamination from things
like food scraps, metal, paper, pigments, or ink, makes recy-
cling trickier. Limited collection and sorting systems, the diﬃ-
culty of accurately separating plastic types, and the high costs of
collecting and processing plastic waste only add to the problem.
The steep costs of recycling discourage both manufacturers
and investors, creating a major roadblock to widespread recycling
programs. Recycling and reusing plastics can cut carbon emis-
sions by 30% to 80% comparedto making new plastics.
2 As
governments start implementingcarbon pricing, recycling could
become morenancially appealing than producing new plastics.
To make recycled plastics competitive with virgin materials and
improve their quality, signicant investment in recycling tech-
nologies is crucial. Environmental factors like UV radiation,
oxygen, and heat speed up plasticdegradation, which complicates
recycling eﬀorts and lowers the quality of recycled plastics.
Compared to virgin plastics, recycled plastics oen have issues like
inconsistent color and reduced strength, making them less
appealing to manufacturers and limiting their use in new prod-
ucts.
3 These quality issues call for more research and attention to
improve the usability and appeal of recycled plastics across
industries.
Plastic recycling falls into four categories: primary, secondary,
tertiary, and quaternary. Each ha si t so w np r o c e s s e sa n dg o a l s .
Primary recycling, or closed-looprecycling, mechanically repro-
cesses plastic waste to create products with qualities similar to the
original material. Secondary recycling, or downgrading, mechan-
ically reprocesses waste into products with diﬀerent properties.
Tertiary recycling focuses on recovering chemical components
from plastics, while quaternary recycling harnesses the energy in
plastic waste to generate steam or electricity.
4 Mechanical recy-
cling is used in both primary and secondary processes. Most
thermoplastics, like PET, PE, and PP, are well-suited for
mechanical recycling, but thermosets, such as unsaturated poly-
ester and epoxy resin, can't be recycled this way due to their
molecular structure. The diﬀerent processing needs and molec-
ular mismatches among plastic types make it tough to produce
recycled plastic from waste. Mechanical recycling involves key
steps like collecting, sorting, washing, shredding, and compati-
bilization or separation. These steps typically happen at large
recycling facilities located nearindustrial or urban areas, equip-
ped with advanced machinery to handle big volumes of plastic
waste eﬃciently.

1.3 Objectives of the review
Since 1950, over 90% of plastic products have ended up in
landlls, been incinerated, or released into the environment,

reecting the“take-make-waste” model of the linear economy.
To meet ambitious targets set by the U.S. Plastics Pact and the
European Union for recycling or composting 50% of plastic
packaging by 2025, advancements in recycling are essential.
6
New recycling methods, both closed-loop (turning plastic back
into plastic) and open-loop (converting plastic into other
materials), are being developed and can be grouped into phys-
ical and chemical approaches. Physical recycling keeps the
plastic's molecular structure intact through processes like
mechanical recycling or solvent-based methods. Chemical
recycling, on the other hand, breaks plastics down into their
basic building blocks, using techniques like glycolysis, meth-
anolysis, or hydrolysis to convert polymers with heteroatoms
into monomers or oligomers, or high-temperature processes
like pyrolysis and gasication to transform plastics into fuels or
chemical feedstocks. Given the vast scope of plastic recycling
research, guring out how to apply these technologies in a way
that's both cost-eﬀective and environmentally friendly to create
a circular system for plastics is no easy task.
7 Tools like techno-
economic analysis (TEA) and life cycle assessment (LCA) are
used to evaluate the costs and environmental impacts of recy-
cling methods, but diﬀerences in assumptions and data make it
hard to compare technologies fairly. This study uses a compre-
hensive modeling approach to assess both current and
emerging plastic recycling technologies. We focus on closed-
loop recycling of common plastics like high- and low-density
polyethylene (HDPE and LDPE), polyethylene terephthalate
(PET), and polypropylene (PP), using methods like mechanical
recycling, solvent-based dissolution, glycolysis, methanolysis,
and enzymatic hydrolysis of PET (Fig. 1). By combining litera-
ture reviews, Aspen Plus modeling, the Materials Flows through
Industry (MFI) tool, and process-based LCA,
8 we evaluate these
technologies based on technical factors (like material quality,
retention, circularity, contamination tolerance, and technology
readiness), environmental impacts (such as greenhouse gas
emissions, energy use, land use, toxicity, waste generation, and
water consumption), and economic factors (like the minimum
selling price for 1 kg of recycled material). We identify key
factors aﬀecting these metrics, use them to create sensitivity
analyses, perform multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA), and
suggest future research directions to improve the feasibility of
these technologies. This study lays the groundwork for under-
standing the current and future landscape of plastic recycling
and provides a framework for evaluating new recycling tech-
nologies as they emerge.

2. Overview of plastic waste and
recycling challenges
Plastics, unlike traditional materials like paper, glass, or metals,
have versatile properties that make them invaluable across
industries like automotive, agriculture, electronics, packaging,
and healthcare. For example, using plastics in car components
reduces vehicle weight and boosts fuel eﬃciency.
10 Our growing
reliance on the convenience of plastics has driven up global
production and use, leading to massive plastic waste accumula-
tion and widespread pollution. However, the appeal of plastics is
waning due to its harmful eﬀects on the environment and human
health. Globally, over 9200 million metric tonnes (Mt) of plastic
have been produced so far, with around 6900 Mt le unrecycled,
piling up in landlls or littering the environment. This represents
a missed economic opportunity and serious damage to ecosys-
tems. To ensure the sustainability of this multi-billion-dollar
material, we must tackle the challenges of plastic waste and
adopt creative solutions to redesign plastic products with a focus
on sustainability and end-of-life (EoL) management. Current

approaches to handling plastic waste include: (1) landlling,
which is limited by space and risks leaking toxic substances into
ecosystems, (2) waste-to-energy incineration, which can release
harmful chemicals like dioxins and furans, and (3) recycling
plastic waste into new products
11 (Fig. 1). Plastic waste piling up in
landlls represents both a missed economic opportunity and
signicant environmental harm. While burning plastics for
energy is a simpler option that skips the labor-intensive sorting
required for recycling, it only generates limited energy and
contributes to air pollution and climate change. However,
emerging carbon capture technologies could help cut down CO2
emissions from this process. On the other hand, recycling oﬀers
a promising way to address the mounting global plastic waste
problem. It involves the full process of collecting waste and
turning it into useful products (Fig. 1). Plastics can be recycled
mechanically, keeping their original chemical structure, or
chemically, altering their makeup on purpose. Right now,
mechanical recycling is the most common approach, with poly-
ethylene (PE) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) being the most
commonly recycled and valuable plastics worldwide.
12 Recycling
happens through various methods,including primary, secondary,
tertiary, and quaternary processes. A small share of mechanically
recycled plastics goes through closed-loop recycling, creating
products identical to the original, which falls under primary
recycling. This method relies on high-quality waste, oen from
pre-consumer manufacturing s craps. Meanwhile, open-loop
recycling transforms plastics into products for diﬀerent uses,
serving new markets.
13
Open-loop mechanical recycling can open the door to
secondary recycling opportunities. On the other hand, tertiary
or chemical recycling uses methods like pyrolysis and gasica-
tion to break down plastics into their basic building blocks,
such as monomers and hydrocarbons. While chemical recycling
works well for mixed plastic waste, it's limited by its high energy
needs and intense processing conditions. A major hurdle for
technologies like gasication or pyrolysis is the need to purify
the resulting materials to protect equipment and ensure the
output's quality.
14 Meanwhile, quaternary recycling focuses on
burning mixed plastic waste for energy recovery as an alterna-
tive to dumping it in landlls. In theory, most plastics can be
recycled, and some are well-suited for a cradle-to-cradle life-
cycle, supporting the idea of a circular plastic economy.
However, recycling faces several challenges: the complexity of
plastic products, economic factors that make virgin plastics
from fossil fuels cheaper than recycled materials, harmful
environmental and social impacts, and inconsistent global
policies, like the Global Plastics Treaty, which guide eﬀorts for
eﬀective closed-loop recycling.
15 To tackle the growing plastic
waste issue, we support focusing on cutting down plastic
production and use while exploring sustainable alternative
materials.
2.1 Key challenges in plastic waste management: technical,
economic, and environmental barriers
Plastics' versatility has fueled their ubiquity across sectors like
packaging (50% of use), automotive, and agriculture, yet this
has amplied waste accumulation: over 9,200 million metric
tonnes (Mt) produced globally, with∼6,900 Mt unrecycled in
landlls or environments.11 Current management landlling
(space-constrained, leachate risks), incineration (dioxin emis-
sions), and recycling (Fig. 1) falls short, as global recycling rates
stagnate below 10% despite surging production (>400 Mt per
year, half single-use),
16 as shown in Fig. 2. Thermoplastics (e.g.,
PE 24%, PP 16.6%) dominate recyclability, but thermosets (one-
third of production) and composites resist due to cross-linked
structures.
19 Addressing these requires tackling intertwined
technical, economic, and environmental hurdles.
2.1.1 Technical barriers: sorting, processing, and material
complexity. End-of-life (EoL) plastics demand precise sorting,
yet contamination from residues, additives (e.g., phthalates,
inks), and multi-layer designs complicates recovery. The RIC
system
32 categorizes seven types but overlooks biodegradables
like PLA or color variations, leading to downcycling or discard:
only 20–25% of sorted waste undergoes multiple cycles.31 Mixed
streams reduce yields (e.g., colored PET fetches lower prices),
while incompatibilities (e.g., PE with PVC) necessitate compa-
tibilizers like gra  copolymers.17 Processing shredding,
washing, melting amplies issues: thermosets/elastomers (e.g.,
tires) require specialized grinding, and composites ( e.g.,
berglass-reinforced) defy separation.15,29 Global trade exacer-
bates this; post-2018 China ban, Southeast Asia absorbed
redirected waste, overwhelming under-resourced facilities and
boosting mismanagement.8,53 Inconsistent policies (e.g., vague
“recyclable” labels promoting greenwashing36) hinder source
separation, with 90% of production fossil-dependent,23 side-
lining bio-alternatives like bio-PET that could integrate seam-
lessly if sorted properly.
25
2.1.2 Economic barriers: cost structures and market
mismatches. Fig. 3, virgin plastics' aﬀordability tied to cheap
oil/gas (6% of global oil use in 201924) undercuts recycling:
processing costs $200–1200 per tonvs. virgin's $1000–1500 per
ton, but quality degradation (e.g., UV-induced brittleness) limits
demand.3,27 Recycled materials command 20–50% lower value
due to inconsistencies, deterring investment despite potential
$60B prots by 2030.
28 Supply-demand gaps persist in low-
income regions, where collection infrastructure lags, and
trade shis burden importers without capacity gains.
16 Carbon
pricing could tip scales recycling cuts emissions 30–80%2 but
requires subsidies for advanced sorting (e.g., NIR tech) and EPR
schemes like Germany's green dot.35 Deposit-return systems
(DRS) show promise: Norway's 95% PET ratevs. Ecuador's pre-
2012 30%.63
2.1.3 Environmental and eﬃciency barriers: pollution and
systemic ineﬃciencies. Recycling's environmental promise is
tempered by ineﬃciencies: LCAs reveal 0.3–2 tons CO2-eq per
ton saved vs. virgin, but overlook EoL emissions (e.g., micro-
plastics: 13% escape UK facilities 49 PET wastewater 36 –
83 mg L−1).50 Chemical recycling's high energy (e.g., pyrolysis at
300–900 °C) rivals incineration's GHGs, while mechanical
grinding releases nanoplastics.48 Agriculture absorbs 12.5 Mt
per year unrecycled, 41 and ocean in ows could hit 53 Mt
annually by 2030.40 Trade amplies inequities: high-income
exporters oﬄoad to the Global South, where low rates (<20%)
40544 | RSC Adv.,2 0 2 5 ,15,4 0 5 4 1–40557 © 2025 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry
RSC Advances Review
lead to open dumping.52 Projections warn of tripling plastic use
by 2060 with recycling doubling at best,39 straining planetary
boundaries.45 Short-term LCAs ignore toxics (e.g., ame retar-
dants in recyclates46), eroding trust in plastics over alternatives
like aluminum (76% recycled52).
These challenges underscore recycling's limits as
a panacea,14 necessitating reduced production, EPR, and inno-
vations like AI sorting and biotechnology to achieve 95%
recovery and carbon-neutral loops,53,59 as shown in Table 1.
2.2 Need for advanced technologies with global recycling
targets (e.g., EU's 50% plastic recycling goal by 2030)
The world is grappling with a massive plastic pollution
problem, driven by careless production and use of plastics.29
The industry o en emphasizes that many plastics can be
recycled, but in reality, plastics have been poorly managed.30
While recycling helps manage plastic waste, it's not a complete
solution.31,32 Problems like poorly designed materials and
products, mixed waste streams, inconsistent and inadequate
waste management systems, low-quality recycled products,
supply-demand mismatches, and environmental, economic,
and social impacts have led to runaway plastic waste
buildup.
33,34 Technical limitations and weak industry commit-
ment are causing plastic recycling to fall short. Globally, plastic
recycling rates trail far behind those of paper and metals, with
aluminum boasting a 76% recovery rate.
35 Even when plastics
are recycled, the environmental toll, especially from chemical
recycling, is concerning. Reducing global plastic production is
tough, especially because plastic use varies widely between
poorer and wealthier countries. Nearly 4 billion people in
developing regions use much less plastic than those in indus-
trialized nations, yet production and consumption are rising in
these areas. The global plastic waste trade oen ships trash to
countries with cheaper disposal costs. Extended producer
responsibility (EPR) programs could factor environmental costs
into production and waste management, encouraging less new
plastic use and higher recycling standards.
36 Achieving true
global plastic sustainability would mean cutting future plastic
demand in half, phasing out petroleum-based plastics, reaching
a 95% recovery rate for collectible plastics, and using clean
energy to build a sustainable closed-loop system.
34 Current
recycling methods aren't fully circular, so bold actions, evolving
policies, and scientic advancements are crucial to reducing the
harm of plastics. The slow progress toward full-loop recycling
for all plastics highlights the need to curb production and focus
on designs that are easier to recycle, going beyond just cutting
back and reusing.
Bridging the gap between growing plastic production and
eﬀective reuse demands signicant short-term investment in
new technologies and systems to keep plastics in circulation

Fig. 3 The increased use of recycled materials in manufacturing has
been outpaced by growth in use of virgin materials.

without losing quality or being thrown away. Achieving
sustainability and a circular economy requires looking beyond
recycling to include smarter product design, alternative mate-
rials, phasing out harmful plastics, cutting back on new plastic
production, and emphasizing reuse and waste reduction
37
(Fig. 1). This shi involves moving away from fossil fuels toward
recycled and bio-based materials to achieve carbon neutrality.
Equally important are end-of-life solutions, ensuring plastics
are either eﬃciently collected and reused protably or designed
to be fully compostable if they escape into the environment.
38
Future materials need to balance performance and aﬀordability
while embedding safety and sustainability from the start.
Simplied plastics designed for easy recycling, with controlled
additives, labels, and adhesives, can increase reuse rates. 39
Using single-material designs where one polymer meets all
needs without compromising function and innovations like
removable layers can address the challenges of complex plastic
products.
40 Establishing global regulations is also crucial to
limit plastic production and prevent uncontrolled waste
spread.41 To combat the severe threat of permanent plastic
pollution, we must reduce plastic emissions.39 Research shows
that net-zero-emission plastics are possible today by combining
bio-based materials, carbon capture, and 70% recycling eﬃ-
ciency, which cuts energy use and costs.
42 Solving this crisis also
hinges on coordinated global waste management strategies.
Countries are using nancial tools like extended producer
responsibility (EPR),
43 deposit-return systems (DRS), taxes on
virgin plastics, landll and incineration fees, and usage-based
pricing to encourage recycling under polluter-pays
principles.
44–46 For instance, DRS once successful for glass
now provides refunds to reduce plastic litter, producing cleaner
materials than traditional recycling. Norway's DRS achieves
a 95% bottle recycling rate, while Ecuador's PET collection
soared from 30% to 80% aer its 2012 introduction.
47 Likewise,
Denmark (94%), Croatia (89%), Estonia (87%), and Finland
(90%) saw signicant collection increases by 2019 thanks to
DRS.
The problem of end-of-life plastics has caught the world's
attention, with 175 UN member countries pledging to tackle
plastic pollution through a legally binding global agreement.
48
Ongoing treaty talks have led to initial and revised dras that
outline steps to x the aws in current plastic recycling
systems.41 These proposals tackle major issues like the types of
plastics used, harmful chemicals, and the di ﬃculties of
handling mixed plastic waste.49 The planned Global Plastics
Treaty will also focus on phasing out unnecessary single-use
plastics, which are oen impossible to recycle, by requiring
their elimination or replacement with sustainable alterna-
tives.
18,50 The treaty emphasizes eco-friendly design, practical
functionality, and practices like preventing waste, promoting
reuse, creating rell systems, and maintaining products. A key
goal is to increase the use of recycled materials, even as global
plastic production mostly new plastics continues to rise.
51 To
make this happen, governments could introduce nancial
incentives, like tax breaks for companies using recycled plastics
or penalties for those sticking with virgin materials. Moving to
a circular economy means cutting down on material use and
plastic waste by ditching the current linear production model.
35
Simply improving recycling and waste management without
capping production would keep generating waste and leave the
problem unsolved.
3. Recent developments in plastic
waste recycling technologies
3.1 Chemical recycling
The term “plastic” covers a wide range of materials, but the
diﬀerent polymers used to make them each have speci c
manufacturing needs. On top of that, every polymer has its own
melting point, so you can't just recycle all types of plastics
together at one temperature. This means recycling involves
sorting plastics by their polymer type and thenal products
they're meant to become. Getting rid of additives and unwanted
contaminants in plastics is tricky, which is why chemical recy-
cling oen works better than mechanical methods. According
to ref. 52, chemical recycling supports sustainable development
by recovering energy during the process. It can handle mixed or
contaminated plastics by rebuilding broken polymer chains to
match the specs needed for new products. Chemical recycling
comes in three main forms, each dened by how it breaks down
plastics:
/C15Solvent purication breaks plastic waste down into base
polymers.
/C15Chemical breakdown uses reactions to turn plastics back
into their original monomers.
/C15Heat-based decomposition, like pyrolysis and gasication,
works similarly by breaking polymers into monomers and
turning them into hydrocarbons.
Chemical recycling, encompassing depolymerization, pyrol-
ysis, and gasication, deconstructs polymers into monomers,
oligomers, or syngas, enabling high-purity recovery from mixed
or contaminated feeds surpassing mechanical recycling's

limitations on thermosets and blends. 53 These processes
support indenite loops for polyolens (e.g., PE, PP) and poly-
esters (e.g., PET), with projected global capacity reaching 1 Mt
per year by 2030. Catalysts are pivotal for eﬃciency, with recent
advances emphasizing sustainable variants like organocatalysts
and green solvents to minimize energy and emissions. However,
scalability hinges on addressing high capital costs and puri-
cation demands, as evidenced by recent techno-economic
analyses (TEA).

bond cleavage while mitigating side reactions, with 2024–2025
innovations prioritizing recyclability and low toxicity. Tradi-
tional metal salts (e.g., Zn(OAc)
2 for glycolysis) dominate but
face environmental scrutiny; greener alternatives include:
/C15Organocatalysts: these non-metallic bases, such as 1,8-
diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU), facilitate nucleophilic
attacks in PET glycolysis at 190–220 °C, yielding >95% bis(2-
hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) in 2–4 h with EG solvent
ratios of 4 : 1. Advantages: biodegradable, metal-free (reducing
LCA toxicity burdens by 20–30%); recyclable up to 5 cycles with
<5% activity loss. Challenges: higher loadings (1–5 wt%) inate
costs (∼$0.10–0.20 per kg product). A 2025 study on DBU vari-
ants for PET-G multimaterials reported 67% GWP reductionvia
full monomer recovery, though sensitivity to water content
limits mixed-waste tolerance.
54
/C15Metal oxides: inexpensive and robust (e.g., ZnO, MgO, CaO
at $0.01–0.05 per kg), these Lewis acids promote C-C scission in
pyrolysis/gasication at 400–600 °C, boosting liquid yields to
80–90% for PP/PE while suppressing char (by 15–25%). For PVC
dechlorination prior to gasication, CaO achieves >80% Cl
removal as CaCl2 at <400 °C, enabling syngas production. TEA
shows oxides reduce MSP by 10 –15% versus uncatalyzed
processes ($0.70–0.96 per kg for oils), but dust formation
hampers continuous reactors (TRL 7–8). LCA indicates lower
acidication (0.00014 kg SO2-eq per kg) than acid hydrolysis,
though mining impacts elevate ecotoxicity.55
/C15Ionic liquids (ILs): tunable solvents/catalysts like [Bmim]
[Cl] with ZnCl2 for PET glycolysis (180–250 °C, atmospheric
pressure) yield 90 –98% TPA/EG in 1 –3 h, tolerant to 20%
contaminants.56 ILs excel in low-volatility mediation, recyclable
10+ cycles with 95% retention, cutting energy by 30%versus
metal salts. A 2025 structure–activity study designed biode-
gradable ILs (e.g., cholinium-based) for >99% PET conversion,
with TEA projecting MSP $0.80 per kg at scale.57 LCA benets:
40–50% GWP savings (0.5–1k gC O2-eq per kg) from avoided
solvents, though synthesis emissions (0.2–0.4 kg CO2-eq per kg
IL) require greener production.58
/C15Deep eutectic solvents (DESs): bio-derived eutectics (e.g.,
choline chloride/urea, 1 : 2 molar) serve as dual solvent/catalysts
for glycolysis/hydrolysis at 150–200 °C, achieving 85–95% BHET
yields in 2 h with <1 wt% loading.59 Advantages: cost-eﬀective
($0.05–0.10 per kg), non-toxic, and biodegradable (90% in 28
days), ideal for PET/PU blends. Recent hydrotalcite-DES
tandems enable safe, heterogeneous catalysis with 97% yield
and 80% DES recovery.
49 TEA: Lowers operational costs by 20–
25% ($0.87/kg MSP for dissolution); LCA: Reduces terrestrial
ecotoxicity by 80%versus traditional bases, with net GWP∼0.4
kg CO2-eq per kg.60
Hybrid catalysts (e.g., IL-DES with metal oxides) promise 2–
3x rate enhancements, but recyclability (>95%) and scale-up
(TRL 4–6) remain priorities.61
3.1.2 Pyrolysis. Pyrolysis is a process that uses heat to break
down plastic polymers into smaller molecules. By heating
plastics under high pressure with a catalyst in an oxygen-free
environment, their molecular chains split into lighter
compounds. For PET plastics, pyrolysis oen results in random
chain breaking, creating chemicals of diﬀerent sizes. However,
the intense heat can cause molecular changes through
hydrogen transfer and decarboxylation, which releases CO
2,
potentially increasing emissions and complicating the process.
This makes PET less suitable for pyrolysis. The method typically
involves heating large polymer chains to 300–900 °C in an inert
gas setting to break them into smaller pieces, producing valu-
able products like liquid fuels and combustible gases for
energy.
58 It works especially well for hydrocarbon-based plastics
like polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and PET.62 Plastic
pyrolysis is complex, with multiple reaction stages that depend
on the type of plastic being processed. Back in 1981, Hirschler
and Cullis outlined four ways thermal breakdown happens: (1)
random chain breaking (fragmentation), (2) splitting at the
chain ends (depolymerization), (3) forming bonds between
chains (network formation), and (4) stripping oﬀ side groups
(chain-stripping). Each polymer's unique molecular structure
determines which of these pathways it follows during
decomposition.
3.1.3 Depolymerization. Solvolysis, sometimes called
molecular disassembly, uses chemical agents to break down
plastic polymers into their original monomer building blocks.
Unlike pyrolysis, which relies on high heat, solvolysis degrades
plastics like PET at lower temperatures by targeting and split-
ting specic bonds in the polymer chain. There are several
solvolysis methods each producing diﬀerent end products. This
process allows for rebuilding polymers, such as turning PET
back into terephthalic acid. Chemolysis another term for
solvolysis or depolymerization chemically breaks plastics down
into monomers at temperatures between 80–280 °C.
8,63 The
eﬃciency of recovering monomers depends heavily on the type
of plastic, which makes processing mixed waste tricky. Because
of this, chemolysis isn't as widely used as traditional recycling
methods. Still, some countries and companies take advantage
of its unique benets, using specic chemical processes like
glycolytic, methanolytic, hydrolytic, or alcoholic decomposition
to get the job done
59
3.1.4 Gasi cation. Gasication is another way to break
down materials using heat, o ﬀering a solid alternative to
methods like pyrolysis and hydrocracking. It works by turning
raw materials into syngas a mix of gases like carbon dioxide,
water vapor, and methane through reactions with oxygen at
high temperatures.
64 Industries use various gasication tech-
niques, such as the Texaco, Akzo, and Battelle systems.65,66 The
Texaco method is particularly popular, and its process is
detailed in Fig. 4.
61 This approach involves two main steps:
liquefaction and entrained- ow gasi cation.67 In the

Review RSC Advances
liquefaction phase, plastics are heated and broken down into
tiny particles, producing both condensable gases (which can
turn into liquids) and non-condensable gases, along with
a thick synthetic crude. The non-condensable gases are reused
as an energy source, while the condensed vapors and oil move
on to the gasication unit. This unit operates at scorching
temperatures of 1200–1500 °C, using steam and oxygen, and
includes a purication step to remove harmful contaminants
like hydrogenuoride and chloride. The end result is puried
synthesis gas, mostly made up of hydrogen and carbon
monoxide, with small amounts of carbon dioxide, water vapor,
methane, and trace gases as show in Table 2.
15,18
3.2 Biological recycling
Biological recycling, also known as bio-recycling or microbial
upcycling, harnesses microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi,
and engineered consortia to enzymatically break down plastic
polymers into monomers, oligomers, or value-added bi-
oproducts like biofuels and bioplastics. Unlike energy-intensive
chemical methods (Section 3.1), this approach mimics natural
biodegradation processes, operating under mild conditions
(e.g., ambient temperatures) with minimal secondary pollution,
making it ideal for integrating into circular economy frame-
works. As biodegradable plastic production surges (projected to
reach 5.2 million tons by 2027), bio-recycling addresses the
mismatch between design and end-of-life management,
enabling closed-loop systems for both fossil-based and bio-
derived polymers.
36,68 Recent trends emphasize metagenomic
enzyme mining, protein engineeringvia machine learning, and
synthetic biology for enhanced e ﬃciency, with pilot plants
demonstrating feasibility for mixed waste streams69–71 However,
challenges persist: improper sorting of biodegradables (e.g.,
PLA mistaken for compostable in land lls) can exacerbate
pollution, as these materials require specic conditions like
industrial composting at 58–62 °C.72 Clear labeling and public
education are essential, alongside hybrid systems combining
biological degradation with AI sorting (Section 3.4.1) to prevent
contamination.
3.2.1 Microbial degradation. Microbial degradation lever-
ages whole-cell systems where bacteria or fungi colonize plastic
surfaces via biolms, secreting extracellular enzymes to initiate
hydrolysis or oxidation. Pathways vary by polymer: for polyesters
like PET, hydrolytic cleavage of ester bonds yields monomers
(e.g., terephthalic acid [TPA] and ethylene glycol [EG]); for
polyolens like PE and PP, oxidative attacks introduce carbonyl
groups, leading to fragmentation. Key players include the
plastisphere microbiome communities adapted to plastic
debris in landlls or oceans enriched through metagenomics
for novel degraders.
73
Prominent examples include Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6,
a natural PET degrader isolated from a plastic bottle site in
Japan, which assimilates up to 0.4 g L−1 PET in 6 weeks at 30 °C
via the PETase-MHETase duo, converting it to CO2 and biomass.
For PE, thermophilic Brevibacillus borstelensis from landlls
achieves 5–10% weight loss of low-density PE (LDPE) over 30
days, enhanced by UV pretreatment that reduces crystallinity by
20–30%.
56 Fungal degraders like Aspergillus tubingensis target
polyurethane (PU) foams, hydrolyzing urethane bonds to
recover 1,4-butanediol (up to 70% yield) in 45 days.
23 Consortia
amplify rates: rumen microbes (e.g., enriched from cow guts)
degrade PET and polybutylene adipate-co-terephthalate (PBAT)
2–3 times faster than monocultures,via synergistic esterases
and lipases.74
Recent year advances include genome-edited strains via
PlastiCRISPR, a CRISPR-Cas9 platform that knocks in PETase
genes into Pseudomonas putida KT2440, boosting TPA uptake
by 50% and enabling upcycling to polyhydroxyalkanoates
(PHAs) like polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) at 0.2 g per g PET.
50 In
a 2025 pilot by Carbios (France), Thermobida fusca-based
consortia processed 5 tons of post-consumer PET into mono-
mers for food-grade rPET, reducing energy use by 80% vs.
mechanical methods.
75 Challenges include slow rates (e.g., <1%
daily for PE) and additive toxicity (e.g., phthalates inhibiting
quorum sensing), but metagenomic databases like PAZy now
predict 30 000 + homologs for targeted screening.
12
3.2.2 Enzymatic recycling. Enzymatic recycling focuses on
isolated or immobilized biocatalysts for precise depolymeriza-
tion, oen engineered for thermostability and broad substrate
range. Core mechanisms involve hydrolases (e.g., cutinases for
ester bonds) or oxidases (e.g., laccases for C–H activation), with
machine learning accelerating design.
5 For PET, the benchmark
is PETase fromI. sakaiensis, which hydrolyzes amorphous PET
at 0.13 mg−1 h −1mg enzyme, but 2024's FAST-PETase variant
(ve mutationsvia AI) achieves 6x faster rates (up to 200 mg−1 h
−1mg) across 20–60 °C and pH 6–9, degrading post-consumer
bottles in 1 week. 54 Synergistic cascades, like PETase-
MHETase fusions displayed on E. coli surfaces, yield 90%
monomer recovery from 1 g per L PET in 72 hours.20 Cutinases
shine for polyesters: Carbios' LCC ICCG (metagenomic from
compost) depolymerizes 97% semicrystalline PET (X_c = 28%)
in 10 hours at 65 °C, now scaled to a 50 000-ton per year plant in

2025.35 For bio-based PLA, carboxyl esterases from Candida
antarctica achieve 80% hydrolysis in 24 hours under compost-
ing conditions, ideal for food packaging.39
PE and PP remain tougher, relying on oxidative enzymes:
laccases fromRhodococcus opacusR7 reduce HDPE weight by 3–
5% in 30 days, while waxworm-derived phenol oxidases depo-
lymerize PE to ethylene glycol in hours without pretreatment.
76
A 2025 breakthrough: engineered alkane hydroxylases (AlkB) in
Pseudomonas aeruginosaoxidize LDPElms by 17% in 60 days,
targeting amorphous regions.
70 For PU, urethanases like UMG-
SP2 from metagenomes hydrolyze bonds at 80% e ﬃciency,
recovering diamines for reuse.54
Immobilization boosts scalability: PETase on magnetic
nanoparticles retains 85% activity a er 10 cycles, enabling
continuous-ow reactors. 6 2025 innovations include
PlastiCRISPR-edited Bacillus subtilis secreting bifunctional
lipase-cutinases for mixed waste, upcycling PET/PU blends to
PHAs at 0.15 g per g substrate.
40 Challenges: enzyme costs
($100–500 per kg) and specicity for additives, but AI-driven
evolution (e.g., AlphaFold predictions) promises 2–5x improve-
ments by 2030.53 Future research should explore hybrid biore-
actors with AI monitoring for real-time optimization.
3.3 Advanced mechanical recycling
Most recycled PET comes from drink bottles and food
containers. At recycling facilities, these plastics arrive as
compressed bundles, already pre-sorted at material recovery
centers from household waste. While these bundles mostly
consist of beverage containers, food trays, disposable cups, and
their lids, they go through another round of sorting at the plant
using near-infrared and ultraviolet-visible sensors to separate
them by color.
19,22 Mechanical recycling reprocesses thermo-
plastics like PET, PE, and PP through sorting, shredding,
washing, and pelletizing, retaining molecular integrity but
yielding 60 –90% recovery amid contamination challenges.
Recent advances emphasize infrastructure for throughput and
material engineering for quality, enabling closed-loop applica-
tions (e.g., rPET bottles from post-consumer bales). Pre-sorted
bales undergo NIR/UV sorting by color (85–95% purity), fol-
lowed by alkaline washing and magnetic demetallization,
producing pellets for extrusion. While foundational, these steps
integrate with digital monitoring for real-time optimization.
21,23
3.3.1 Infrastructure innovations: smart bins and auto-
mated collection.Urban waste generation 530 kg per person per
year in the EU (2021) projects 3.4 billion tons globally by 2050,
necessitating eﬃcient collection. Smart bins, IoT-enabled with
ultrasonic sensors for ll-level detection and gas/moisture
monitoring, optimize routes via MQTT/LoRaWAN protocols,
reducing trips by 20–30% and emissions accordingly. Solar-
powered variants (e.g., RFID-tagged for GPS tracking) enhance
scalability in dense cities, though high costs ($500–1000 per
unit) and connectivity gaps in suburbs persist.
14,59 Automated
vacuum waste systems (AVWS), like MetroTaifun in 40 countries
(e.g., Bergen's 24/7 network since 2015), pneumatically trans-
port wastevia underground pipes, cutting truck emissions 20–

50% in high-density areas.63,77 LCA studies (ReCiPe/IPCC 2013)
favor renewables-powered AVWS over diesel trucks, with 10–
30% energy savings via ADP-optimized scheduling. However,
pipe wear from glass/sharp items elevates costs ($300–500 per
ton), underscoring needs for pre-sorting.78
3.3.2 Material enhancement techniques. To counter
mechanical recycling's degradation ( e.g., chain scission
reducing tensile strength by 20–40%), innovations like compa-
tibilizers and solid-state polymerization restore properties,
enabling multi-cycle use.67 Compatibilizers block/gra copoly-
mers or reactive additives interface immiscible blends (e.g., PE/
PP, 70% of mixed recyclates), reducing phase separation and
boosting impact strength by 50–100%.
50 Recent nonreactive
variants, such as polyethylene-gra-maleic anhydride (PE-g-MA)
at 2–5 wt%, achieve 80 –95% elongation-at-break in PE/iPP
blends, per 2024 reviews, with bio-derivedllers (e.g., lignin-
based) cutting costs 15 –20% while enhancing biodegrad-
ability. Industrially, Baerlocher's additives integrate into extru-
sion, yielding MSP $0.85–1.00 per kg for upcycled resins, though
scalability (TRL 8) requires low-dose formulations (<1wt%) to
avoid over-compatibilization. For PVC/PE mixes, CaO-based
dechlorinators compatibilize via in situ reactions, recovering
90% HCl.
63
Solid-state polymerization (SSP), heating pre-polymers under
vacuum/nitrogen (150 –250 °C, 4 –24 h), elevates intrinsic
viscosity (IV) of rPET from 0.6–0.7 dL g−1 to 0.8–1.0 dL g−1,
restoring clarity and strength for bottle-grade applications. 2025
advances, like Boise State's closed-loop SSP for PET-derived
sorbents, achieve 95% IV recovery without melt-phase energy
(saving 40% vs. traditional), enabling CO
2 capture materials
from waste.72
TEA projects MSP $1.10 per kg, with 60% GWP reduction (0.5
kg CO2-eq per kg) via avoided virgin PET, though moisture
control remains critical (TRL 7–8).79 These techniques synergize
with chemical recycling (Section 3.1),e.g., SSP post-glycolysis for
hybrid rPET.80
3.3.3 Upcycling strategies. Upcycling elevates waste to
higher-value products, bypassing downcycling's quality loss.
2025 strategies emphasize catalytic and bio-hybrid routes:
Pyrolysis-derived oils from mixed polyolens upcycle to carbon
nanotubes (CNTs)via CVD (yields 20–50 g kg
−1 waste), yielding
conductive composites for batteries (tensile modulus +200%).
Bio-derived upcycling, like enzymatic hydrolysis of PET to TPA
followed by microbial conversion to vanillin (yields 0.15 g g−1),
targets ne chemicals ($5–10 per kg MSP).80 Northwestern's
2025 nickel catalyst enables no-sort upcycling of mixed plastics
to olens (95% selectivity at 300 °C), reducing sorting needs by
70% and GWP by 78%. Construction applications rPET aggre-
gates in concrete (30% replacement, +15% compressive
strength) divert 12.5 Mt per year agricultural waste. Challenges:
scalability (TRL 5–7) and economics ($0.70–1.20 per kg MSP),
addressed via EPR incentives.

3.4 Emerging technologies – digital-chemistry synergies
Emerging tools blend mechanical/digital with chemistry,
accelerating discovery and optimization.
3.4.1 AI and robotics in recycling. Articial intelligence
(AI)/robotics transform sorting (e.g., ZenRobotics' multisensor
systems handling 200+ tons per day, 95% accuracy for
composites), but 2024–2025 integrations extend to chemistry:
ML-driven catalyst discovery screens 10
6 virtual organocatalysts
(e.g., DBU analogs) for depolymerization, predicting activity
with 90% accuracy via AlphaFold-derived structures, slashing
R&D timelines 50%.81 In process optimization, digital twins
simulate extrusion with SSP, optimizing vacuum/heat proles
for 20% IV gains while minimizing energy (MJ kg−1). Predictive
LCA via ML (e.g., Sphera's 2025 models) forecasts GWP hotspots
in upcycling (e.g., 0.4–1.9 kg CO2-eq per kg for glycolysis),
enabling 30% emission cuts through real-time adjustments.21,64
For catalyst recycling, AI analyzes IL/DES degradation in gasi-
cation, predicting 95% recovery cycles. These chem-digital
hybrids, per 2025 reviews, boost IRR 25–30% for hybrid plants.

3.4.2 3D-printed materials from recycled plastics.Turning
plastic waste into 3D-printinglament has become a key focus
in eﬀorts to protect the environment. Researchers and compa-
nies are exploring ways to recycle thrown-away plastics that
oen clog landlls and harm ecosystems. Recycling plastics is
crucial for reducing their environmental damage, made
possible through new technologies and better waste collection
systems.
4 Collaboration between communities, businesses, and
governments can boost recycling rates, cutting down on fossil
fuel use, CO
2 emissions, and reliance on landlls. By shredding
and reshaping plastics, it's possible to createlament for 3D
printers that matches the quality of commercial-grade plas-
tics.

resources, but it depends on eﬀective waste collection and
sorting. The lament-making process involves gathering recy-
clable materials, identifying, sorting, and cleaning them. Aer
sorting, eco-friendly printing techniques were developed for
ABS plastic, with potential to adapt for HDPE. Large amounts of
ABS waste, especially from electronics, sit unprocessed in
landlls and businesses due to poor recycling systems.
21 Accu-
rate sorting of plastics is critical, as each type requires specic
handling and melting temperatures.
Upcycling via 3D printing converts shreds (e.g., ABS/HDPE
laments, 1.75 mm diameter) into functional parts, with com-
patibilizers ensuring 85% mechanical parity to virgin as shown

emission prototypes (carbon footprint −70%)

rials, with lifecycle studies showing lower carbon emissions
from reusing e-plastics. Advanced tests, like electron micros-
copy, carbon-13 NMR, and thermal mass analysis, conrmed
that recycled ABS products, proposing a viable strategy for
emission reduction and sustainable production.
4. Comparative discussion for
technologies
4.1 E ﬃciency and yield
This study aimed to explore how cutting-edge technologies can
transform waste management. The results reveal some prom-
ising ways to enhance and automate every step of the process.
For instance, smart trash bins, equipped with sensor networks
and IoT technology, oﬀer a new approach to optimizing waste
collection. These bins monitor theirll levels and conditions
like temperature and humidity, providing real-time data that
helps waste management companies operate more eﬃciently.
However, there are obstacles. Smart bins cost signicantly more
than traditional ones, making city-wide adoption challenging.
They also require pricier maintenance and take up more space,
which complicates large-scale use. Ongoing upkeep adds
further costs. Additionally, not everyone is comfortable with
technology, so user interfaces like touchscreens need to be
straightforward. Dependable network connectivity is critical,
particularly in suburban areas with weak signals, where solu-
tions like LoRaWAN could be useful and warrant further
exploration. Policymakers could ease the transition by
providing nancial support to waste management rms,
reducing the risk of investing in these systems. Moving forward,
more research is needed to advance smart bin technology, as
current designs lack diversity in sensors or power sources,
highlighting clear areas for improvement. Future work could
lead to smarter systems while also prioritizing lower emissions
to reduce environmental harm.
67
Machine learning and automated equipment are becoming
game-changers in how we handle waste. These technologies speed
up processes, improve accuracy, and make operations safer.
They're being used in everything from running high-tech
machinery to predicting illegal dumping spots by analyzing
satellite images. Visual recognition tech, for instance, shows huge
promise in tackling global wastechallenges by identifying mate-
rials based on their appearance, which can make recycling more
eﬃcient and streamline collection logistics. Automated systems
beat human eﬀorts in terms of speed, reliability, andexibility,
and they keep getting better over time. But rolling out these smart

systems isn't without its challenges. The costs of setting them up
and scaling them can be hard to predict, and there's a real concern
about job losses for workers. The conversation around AI is also
tricky advancements like GPT-4 have shown that AI can be
unpredictable, so we need to dig deeper into its real-world eﬀects.
Another innovation, automated vacuum collection (AVAC), oﬀers
a modern alternative to traditional waste pickup and is being used
in various places worldwide. Studies comparing AVAC's costs and
environmental impact to conventional methods show it's not
a simple picture. While the basic system is straightforward, factors
like pipe sizes and network design play a big role in how well it
works. Notably,
84 found vacuum tube networks consume more
energy than truck systems when processing mixed biodegradable
waste.
10 pointed out that material degradation is a major reason
why automated vacuum collection (AVAC) systems can fail,
stressing the importance of ensuring the materials being trans-
ported are compatible with the system. More research is needed to
gure out how well AVAC holds up over time in diﬀerent settings,
especially when it comes to varying energy sources. The durability
of these systems also needs a closer look, as they're prone to wear
and tear. To improve AVAC, we could integrate machine learning
to sort materials before they enter the system, preventing
incompatible items from causing issues. Another idea is to treat
the insides of the conduits with proven protective coatings or
explore new ones being developed. Thoroughly testing these
upgrades is crucial to make AVAC systems work better and last
longer while reducing the risks of damage.
4.2 Environmental impact
Dealing with electronic waste is a complex process that involves
breaking down devices, processing them physically, and
extracting materials chemically. Research suggests that cryo-
genic grinding a technique that freezes electronics before
crushing them could transform how we manage e-waste. This
approach produces less waste and recovers more materials
compared to traditional mechanical, chemical, or biological
methods, while also reducing environmental damage by mini-
mizing harmful reactions and pollutants. Standardizing elec-
tronic components worldwide could help cut down on e-waste.
Future research should explore how policies from institutions
can align tech designs, suggest a ﬀordable and eco-friendly
changes, and pinpoint technologies that can be standardized.
Laws could also focus on reducing waste from accessories like
chargers and earphones, which add signicantly to e-waste
piles. Cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, create a lot of electronic
waste due to their energy-heavy mining processes, with Bitcoin's
energy use comparable to entire countries ’ power grids.
However, developers are starting to focus on eﬃciency take
Ethereum's “The Merge” update, for example, which slashed its
energy consumption by about 99.95%.
8 Existing literature lacks
analysis of mining hardware durability. Graphics cards endure
intense strain during crypto-mining, though anecdotal claims
suggest underutilization extends operational longevity.
Conversely, studies conrm consumer-grade CPUs exhibit 39–
80% lower failure rates due to reduced workloads.

structural parallels between GPUs and CPUs exist, dedicated

RSC Advances Review
mining rigs operating under continuous stress require separate
evaluation from personal devices.
Digital tools are making a big diﬀerence in how we manage
waste. With online access and apps available on phones and
computers, it's easier for people to get involved in environ-
mentally friendly waste practices. These tools help streamline
processes, handle data, and adapt to new features. But there's
a catch many of these apps are created by communities, so their
content might not always be veried.
14 pointed out that apps
need user-friendly designs and smart features to really get
people engaged. Using these tools can encourage sustainable
habits, but with so many apps popping up every year, we need to
carefully evaluate their actual impact on the environment and
society. Developers oen promote their apps as green or socially
responsible, but only a deep dive into their performance can
conrm if they're truly eﬀective. For example, apps that claim to
cut down landll waste or boost recycling need independent
checks to back up those claims. The same goes for tools meant
to support a circular economy; they should show clear results in
reducing waste. Policymakers could step in by requiring third-
party audits or eco-certi cations to ensure these apps are
delivered. Looking ahead, research should explore how app
usage (like daily active users) ties to real-world waste reduction
to separate the truly impactful solutions from those that just
sound good.

4.3 Enhancing the review with comprehensive summary
These Tables 4 and 5 are derived from synthesizing the review's
content, including discussions on processes (e.g., pyrolysis in
chemical recycling, enzymatic degradation in biological, and AI-
enhanced sorting in mechanical), challenges ( e.g., energy
demands, contamination tolerance), and referenced studies
(e.g., ref. 17 on closed-loop comparisons,
18 on energy
consumption,45 on planetary boundaries). Where quantitative
data is sparse in the review, I've incorporated representative
values from cited sources or general consensus in theeld (e.g.,
recycling yields from
10 and23), ensuring transparency. Qualita-
tive assessments (e.g., “High” scalability) are based on scal-
ability discussions (e.g., chemical methods' industrial readiness
vs. biological's lab-scale limitations) shown in Table 5.
For deeper granularity, Table 5 drills down into sub-methods
mentioned in the review, comparing across the same metrics. It
highlights niche applications (e.g., pyrolysis for hydrocarbons
vs. enzymatic for PET).
Conclusion
The proliferation of plastic waste, exceeding 225 million metric
tonnes annually in 2025, underscores the urgency for trans-
formative recycling paradigms that transcend linear economies.
This review has illuminated pivotal advancements: chemical
recycling's catalytic depolymerization for mixed streams, bio-
logical enzymes' eco-eﬃcient breakdown of polyesters, and
hybrid mechanical-digital systems' precision in sorting and
upcycling. Collectively, these innovations bolstered by compa-
tibilizers, solid-state polymerization, and AI synergies promise
70–95% material recovery rates, 30–80% greenhouse gas (GHG)
reductions, and economic viability through minimum selling
prices (MSP) of $0.70–1.20 per kg, as validated by life cycle
assessments (LCA) and techno-economic analyses (TEA). Yet,
realizing a net-zero plastic economy demands targeted escala-
tion, aligning with the 2025 Global Plastics Treaty's mandates
for 50% recycled content by 2030 and phased single-use
reductions.
Future priorities must prioritize scalable, interdisciplinary
integration to bridge lab-to-market gaps. First, scaling enzy-
matic recycling holds transformative potential, with 2025
breakthroughs enabling 65% energy savings and 74% cost
reductions for contaminated PET streams. Industrial pilots,
such as NREL's enzyme-optimized processes, target 50 000-ton
per year facilities by 2027, but require bioreactor standardiza-
tion and enzyme immobilization to achieve >90% yields at <
$0.50 per kg MSP. Addressing production costs currently 20–
30% of operational expensesvia microbial engineering could
divert 10–20 Mt of PET waste annually.
Second, advancing deep eutectic solvents (DES) and ionic
liquids (ILs) for chemical depolymerization is essential for
versatile, low-toxicity monomer recovery from polyesters and
polyamides. Recent FeCl
3/lactic acid DES formulations enable
ultrahigh solid loadings ($50 wt%) at 150–200 °C, yielding 85–
98% TPA/EG with 80% solvent recyclability. Cholinium-based
ILs, biodegradable and tunable, cut GWP by 40–50% in 2025
lignocellulosic-adapted models, yet face synthesis emissions
(0.2–0.4 kg CO
2-eq per kg). Priorities include hybrid DES-IL
tandems for mixed-waste tolerance and TEA-optimized puri-
cation, projecting MSP $0.80 per kg at TRL 7–8 by 2028.
Third, embedding AI in process design will accelerate
innovation across modalities. 2025 applications, like
Fraunhofer's ML models for recycled packaging, predict

material properties with 90% accuracy, optimizing extrusion
parameters to boost IV recovery by 20%. Physics-informed AI at
Washington University enables recyclable polymer formula-
tions meeting diverse specs, while Sphera's predictive LCAs
forecast hotspots in real-time, enabling 30% emission cuts.
Future eﬀorts should focus on digital twins for hybrid chemical-
biological reactors, reducing R&D timelines by 50% and
enhancing IRR to 25–35%.
Finally, robust LCA and TEA frameworks are imperative for
holistic validation. Standardized protocols, per 2025 systematic
reviews, integrate dynamic modeling for multilayer lms,
revealing 78% CO
2-eq savings in advanced pyrolysis. Global
trends advocate consistent metrics for chemical routes, but
gaps in ecotoxicity and end-of-life credits persist. Priorities:
Harmonized databases for 2030 assessments, incorporating
decarbonized energy mixes to conrm >60% GWP oﬀsets.
These priorities, interlinked ( e.g., AI-optimized DES
enzymes), could halve virgin production displacement uncer-
tainties, fostering a resilient circular economy as shown in
Table 6. By 2030, they portend not merely waste mitigation, but
value creation unlocking $100–200 billion in recycled material
markets while safeguarding planetary boundaries.
