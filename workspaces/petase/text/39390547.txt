with nowadays 83 million metric tons of PET being pro -
duced per year, and rising [ 4, 5]. Only a fraction of this 
amount is reused or recycled while a large percentage 
is incinerated or accumulated in landfills [ 6]. To com -
bat the frightening amount of built-up PET waste, every 
known recycling strategy must be exploited, aided by the 
development of novel approaches. Currently, mechani -
cal and chemical PET recycling are the most commonly 
employed techniques in industry. While mechanical 
recycling is relatively cost-effective it has the main disad -
vantage of reducing the product quality significantly [ 7]. 
Chemical recycling on the other hand, has many advan -

Abstract
Background The global plastic waste crisis requires combined recycling strategies. One approach, enzymatic 
degradation of PET waste into monomers, followed by re-polymerization, offers a circular economy solution. 
However, challenges remain in producing sufficient amounts of highly active PET-degrading enzymes without costly 
downstream processes.
Results Using the growth-decoupled enGenes eX-press V2 E. coli strain, pH, induction strength and feed rate were 
varied in a factorial-based optimization approach, to find the best-suited production conditions for the PHL7 enzyme. 
This led to a 40% increase in activity of the fermentation supernatant. Optimization of the expression construct 
resulted in a further 4-fold activity gain. Finally, the identified improvements were applied to the production of the 
more active and temperature stable enzyme variant, PHL7mut3. The unpurified fermentation supernatant of the 
PHL7mut3 fermentation was able to completely degrade our PET film sample after 16 h of incubation at 70 °C at an 
enzyme loading of only 0.32 mg enzyme per g of PET.
Conclusions In this research, we present an optimized process for the extracellular production of thermophile and 
highly active PETases PHL7 and PHL7mut3, eliminating the need for costly purification steps. These advancements 
support large-scale enzymatic recycling, contributing to solving the global plastic waste crisis.

used method, can require high pressure, temperature 
and create impurities during the depolymerization pro -
cess [8]. In recent years, a new and promising recycling 
method emerged: enzymatic depolymerization of PET to 
its monomers terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene gly -
col (EG). This approach allows the targeted breakdown of 
PET under normal pressure and relatively mild tempera -
tures without the need for toxic chemicals or even pure, 
pre-sorted PET waste. The obtained monomers can then 
be used for re-polymerization to PET without a loss of 
quality, making true circular PET economy possible [ 9, 
10]. As promising as this sounds, enzymatic recycling is 
facing a few challenges of its own. The slow enzymatic 
conversion rates and the difficulty of producing highly 
active PET degrading enzymes in a cost-effective process 
have so far impeded implementation on a larger scale 
[11].
Enzymes recognized for their ability to degrade PET 
are, among others, leaf-branch compost cutinase (LCC), 
Humicola insolens  cutinase (HiC), Ideonella sakaiensis  
PETase (IsPETase), Thermobifida fusca  hydrolase (TfH) 
and Thermobifida fusca  cutinases (TfCut1 and TfCut2). 
Soong et al. [ 12] describe complete degradation of a 
low crystallinity PET film (lcPET) in 72 h using LCC as 
an enzyme, while HiC reached full degradation in 96  h 
[13]. IsPETase was stated to degrade 1.5% of lcPET in 
24  h, which would indicate complete degradation in 66 
days (linear degradation rate assumed) [ 14]. Müller et 
al. [15] report 54% weight loss of a lcPET film in 3 weeks 
with TfH and TfCut2 degrades 17% of lcPET in 50 h, by 
extrapolation resulting in ~ 12 days for full degradation 
[16]. In 2022, a new PET degrading enzyme, polyester 
hydrolyse Leipzig 7 (PHL7), was found by Sonnendecker 
et al. [ 17]. This highly active enzyme has a denaturation 
temperature of 79 °C, which enables fast recycling at ele -
vated temperatures. The glass-transition temperature of 
PET, roughly 70 °C, enhances the polymer chain mobility, 
thereby rendering the chemical bonds more accessible 
to the enzyme. Thus, enzymatic stability at temperatures 
around 70 °C for prolonged periods of time is an impor -
tant factor for efficient enzymatic PET recycling. Even 
though LCC, the most promising enzyme for PET recy -
cling before the discovery of PHL7, has a 5  °C higher 
denaturation temperature, the activity of PHL7 surpasses 
that of LCC by far. The novel polyester hydrolase is 
described to fully degrade a lcPET film in 16 h, outper -
forming all other enzymes mentioned above distinctly. 
Due to systematic mutagenesis of specific residues in 
the PHL7 subsites I and II, Richter et al. [ 18] were able to 
enhance the PHL7 performance even further, creating a 
PHL7 triple mutant (PHL7mut3 or PHL7_Q175E, L210T, 
D233K) with a higher denaturation temperature and 1.3-
fold increased activity.
In the past, only very low expression titers of cutinases, 
PETases and related enzymes were achieved, amounting 
to only a few milligrams of product per liter [ 19–24]. A 
possible reason for this may be the cytotoxic nature of 
these enzymes, causing cell lysis, excessive foaming dur -
ing fermentation and challenges in downstream opera -
tions [25, 26]. Y. Tan et al. [27]described the tendency of 
cutinases to degrade both the inner and outer membrane 
of E. coli, leading to release of the enzyme into the extra -
cellular space even without the use of a signal sequence. 
Extracellular expression due to cell lysis can prove advan-
tageous, as it eliminates the need for the homogeniza -
tion step. However, the adverse effects of cell lysis like 
low titers, foaming and highly viscous cell broths, must 
be dealt with for the process to become feasible. This 
might be the reason why a large percentage of the PETase 
expression experiments described in literature were done 
in shake flasks and not in reactors [ 28–32]. Certainly, 
expression conditions gathered from shake flask experi -
ments cannot be used to implement large scale enzyme 
production, thus an optimized process for a highly active 
PET degrading enzyme developed under controlled con -
ditions is required. Ideally, the cell-free supernatant of 
the fermentation broth after centrifugation could be 
diluted and utilized in the recycling process without the 
necessity of any purification steps, to keep costs as low as 
possible. However, due to inhibitory effects of cell com -
pounds like DNA and host cell proteins released into the 
fermentation medium together with the enzyme, puri -
fication is often essential to ensure sufficient enzyme 
performance. Therefore, a process optimization strategy 
should not only focus on achieving the highest enzyme 
titers but more importantly on the volumetric enzyme 
activity in the unpurified fermentation supernatant. The 
enzyme titer, the release of protein into the supernatant 
and the enzyme inhibition by compounds present in the 
fermentation supernatant all influence the volumetric 
activity. By identifying the fermentation process yield -
ing the highest volumetric activity the most beneficial 
combination of those factors can be found. Preceding the 
process optimization, the expression strain and expres -
sion construct have to be selected. As an expression host 
E. coli has, inter alia, the advantages of fast growth, short 
process durations, inexpensive media components and a 
vast molecular toolbox to work with [ 33]. In 2020 a new, 
growth-decoupled E. coli  strain, enGenes e X-press V2, 
was created and published by Stargardt et al. [ 34]. This 
host has two major advantages, increased resources for 
recombinant protein production and enhanced extracel -
lular expression, making it the ideal chassis for our proj -
ect. The phage T7 Gp2 gene is under control of the pBAD 
promoter system, which can be induced by addition of 
arabinose to the fermentation medium. After induc -
tion the expressed Gp2 protein inhibits the E. coli  host

cell RNA polymerase. The cell growth is halted, freeing 
up cellular resources for increased recombinant protein 
production. Due to cellular aging in the course of the fer -
mentation process cell membranes become permeable, 
furthering the release of protein of interest (POI) into 
the extracellular space. With the deletion of the arabi -
nose operon genes araBADC arabinose metabolization 
is prevented, rendering low inducer concentrations suf -
ficient. Recombinant protein production is induced by 
the addition of IPTG but for a gentler induction strat -
egy, arabinose can be used as an inducer for both growth 
decoupling and POI expression. This effect was attrib -
uted to promoter cross-talk and leads to slower but pro -
longed expression, which can yield a higher overall titer 
with certain POIs [ 35]. Additionally, facilitating soluble, 
extracellular expression the gene of interest (GOI) can be 
cloned in an expression vector equipped with a N-termi -
nal lamB signal sequence to redirect the product to the 
periplasmic space [36] and a T7A3 tag. The T7A3 tag is a 
polypeptide with a large net negative charge, promoting 
soluble expression and in combination with certain POIs 
can also increase the product titer and therefore act as an 
expression enhancer [37, 38]. In the development stage it 
can also be beneficial to attach an affinity tag to the pro -
tein of interest for easier analytics and the preparation of 
a purified standard of the product. The use of a hexa-his -
tidine (His) tag finds widespread applicability as antibod -
ies for the detection in analytics are readily available and 
purification over nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) 
columns is relatively quick and easy in lab scale [ 39, 40]. 
Those aspects considered, we chose our host strain and 
expression cassette accordingly aiming to find an enzyme 
production process yielding highly active enzyme solu -
tions with little or no need of further purification.
Methods
Strains and cloning
The chemically competent E. coli  strain NEB5α (New 
England Biolabs, NEB, Ipswitch, MA, USA), was used for 
plasmid amplification. The electrocompetent E. coli strain 
ex-press V2 (enGenes Biotech, Vienna, Austria) was 
employed for recombinant protein expression. Trans -
formation of the generated plasmids into the respective 
host organisms was done according to the manufac -
turer’s instructions. The PHL7 and PHL7mut3 enzyme 
sequences (see supplementary information S3) were 
codon optimized for E. coli with a codon optimizer online 
tool (OPTIMIZER, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, http://
genomes.urv.es/OPTIMIZER/ ) and ordered as gBlocks 
from Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT, Coralville, IA, 
USA). The PHL7 enzyme gBlock was ordered with the 
N-terminal T7A3 sequence and the C-terminal 6xHis-
tag already attached, whereas the PHL7mut3 enzyme 
was ordered without the T7A3 sequence. As a backbone 
an in-house produced pET30a.cer expression vector was 
used [41]. The cloning procedures were performed using 
the Q5® High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase and restriction 
enzymes provided by NEB following the supplier’s guide -
lines. A table with all used primers and templates is pre -
sented below (Table 1), the primer and gBlock sequences 
are listed in the supplementary information ( S2 and 
S3). All construct sequences were confirmed by Sanger 
sequencing.
Fed-batch bioreactor cultivations for enzyme production
To optimize our three selected critical process parame -
ters (CPPs), induction strength, feed rate and pH, we first 
designed an initial fermentation process. This experi -
mental set-up was kept consistent over all experiments, 
except for the variation in the three CPPS.
For the pre-culture, a 500 mL baffled bottom flask was 
filled with 30 mL of semi-synthetic medium containing

50 µg/mL kanamycin. The medium was inoculated with 
2 mL of working cell bank and incubated for 5 h at 37 °C 
and 200 rpm. The optical density (OD) was measured and 
the amount of cell suspension equaling 25 OD units was 
used to inoculate 500 mL of batch medium (see supple -
mentary information S1) in the DASGIP reactor system 
(Eppendorf SE, Hamburg, Germany). The temperature 
was kept at 37 ( +/- 0.2) °C, the pH control was set to 7 
(+/- 0.1) and regulated by dosing 12.5% ammonia solu -
tion. The dissolved oxygen (DO) cascade was designed to 
maintain the DO at 30% by first accelerating the stirrer 
speed (400–1200 rpm), then increasing the air flow rate 
(10–200 sL/h) and finally increasing the oxygen concen -
tration in the gas flow (21–100%). Foaming in the reactor 
was kept under control by dosing antifoam agent (1:10 
diluted, Struktol J673A, Schill + Seilacher, Böblingen, 
Germany) when needed. The batch phase ended after 
8.25 h with a cell dry weight (CDW) of 10 g/L. Then the 
first feed phase was started, which was an exponential 
feed (feed medium composition see supplementary infor-
mation S1) with a growth rate of 0.135 h-1. At the end of 
the exponential feed phase 40 g/L of CDW were reached. 
Subsequently the feed was set to a linear feed profile with 
fixed feed rate (0.08 g glucose/min in the initial fermenta-
tion process) and the temperature was set to 30 °C. With 
the start of the linear feed, the growth of the host cells 
was halted by addition of 10 mM arabinose to express the 
T7 phage protein Gp2 and in parallel the enzyme expres -
sion was induced with IPTG (0.4 µmol/g CDW in the ini-
tial fermentation process) thereby decoupling growth and 
recombinant protein production. The first sample was 
taken right before induction as a reference and to deter -
mine possible basal expression of PHL7. Further samples 
were drawn every two hours for a maximum of ten hours. 
In fermentation runs that showed heavy foaming early 
on, sampling intervals were shortened to one hour.
This initial fermentation process was the template for 
all our process optimization trials. For the initial and 
extended informed design experiments we exclusively 
varied the three CPPs according to Figures below.
As described in the previous section fermentation run 
1 represents the initial fermentation process before opti -
mization. This run was performed in biological triplicates 
to determine the variability of the collected experimen -
tal data. All subsequent runs were analyzed in technical 
triplicates. All collected samples were analyzed using the 
methods explained below.
Enzyme activity assay – TPA release
The drawn fermentation samples were centrifuged at 
14,000 rpm for 10 min to separate the cells from the fer -
mentation medium. For every sample 5 safe lock reaction 
tubes (1.5 mL, Eppendorf) were prepared, 4 of which 
were filled with an 8  mg PET film (ES30-FM-000145, 
Goodfellow Cambridge Ltd, UK), and one was left empty 
to function as a blank. The supernatant was diluted 1:7.5 
in 1 M potassium phosphate buffer pH 8 and 0.5 mL were 
added to each of the prepared reaction tubes. After incu -
bating the tubes for 3 h at 70 °C and 700 rpm the absorp -
tion at 242  nm was measured in a microplate reader 
(Tecan Infinite M200). If the absorption exceeded a value 
of 3 the samples were diluted in potassium phosphate 
buffer. To obtain the terephthalic acid concentration 
from the absorption values, a calibration curve for the 
range of 9.375 to 600 µM TPA was set up. The slope of 
our calibration curve was 0.0036. The mM TPA released 
was calculated according to Eq. (1).

To rule out any TPA release of the PET film in buffer, six 
1.5  ml reaction tubes containing solely 1  M potassium 
phosphate buffer and six reaction tubes containing the 
buffer and PET film were incubated for 3 h at 70 °C and 
subsequently the absorbance at 242  nm was measured. 
The comparison of the absorbance of buffer and buffer 
with PET film can be found in supplementary informa -
tion S4. Enzyme activity assay – weight loss of PET film.
Standardized goodfellow PET film was wiped with 
ethanol to remove residues from the surface. To gener -
ate PET samples as an enzyme substrate, 8 mg discs were 
punched out with a hole puncher. The selected fermenta-
tion supernatant samples were diluted 1:7.5 in 1 M potas-
sium phosphate buffer (pH 8) and 0.5 mL were added 
to the reaction tubes containing the PET discs. After 
incubating the reaction tubes at 70 °C and 700 rpm in a 
temperature controlled shaker (VWR® thermal shaker 
lite) the remaining PET samples were removed, washed, 
dried and weighed. The incubation time was 72 h for the 
samples of the initial factorial-based optimization study -
and 24 h for the expression construct evaluation samples. 
The % of PET film degraded was calculated according to 
Eq. (2).

Cell disruption and inclusion body solubilization
For cell disruption a 1 mg pellet sample was obtained by 
measuring the optical density at 600  nm and calculat -
ing the needed amount of cell suspension (OD 600/CDW 
[g/L] = 3.5). After centrifugation (10  min, 14000  rpm), 
we obtained a supernatant and a cell pellet fraction. 
The cell pellets were resuspended in 400  µl sonica -
tion buffer (30 mM TRIS, 50mM NaCl, pH7.2) chilled 
on ice and disrupted by sonication (Hielscher UP100H, 
2 × 90  s, amplitude: 70%, cycle time: 0.5  s). The cell 
debris and insoluble fraction were removed by cen -
trifugation (10  min, 14000  rpm) and the supernatant 
(intracellular soluble fraction) was transferred to a fresh 
tube. The remaining pellet was washed twice (100 mM 
TRIS-HCl pH8) and subsequently the IBs were solubi -
lized in 8  M urea solution for 30  min under mild shak -
ing at room temperature. After a last centrifugation step 
(10 min,14000 rpm) the supernatant, now containing the 
solubilized IB fraction, was transferred to a fresh tube. In 
total we obtained 3 fractions per sample, the fermenta -
tion supernatant, the intracellular soluble and the inclu -
sion body fraction.
SDS-PAGE
To estimate the concentration of POI in our samples 
as well as the distribution between the three fractions 
(inclusion body, intra- and extracellular soluble) the 
samples were analyzed via sodium dodecyl sulfate-poly -
acrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) as described 
by Stargardt et al. [ 34]. Bovine serum albumin (BSA) 
standards with concentrations of 25, 50 and 75  µg/mL 
were used for product titer estimations. For visualization 
of the protein bands Coomassie Brilliant blue R250 was 
used. To couple the band intensity to a protein concen -
tration, the BSA standard bands as well as the POI bands 
were analyzed densitometrically with the ImageQuantTL 
1D software (Version 8.2.0).
Determination of DNA concentration in the fermentation 
supernatant
DNA found outside of the cell, in the fermentation 
medium, is always evidence of cell lysis. The sever -
ity of the lysis can be estimated by determination of the 
DNA concentration, which we did using the Invitro -
gen™ Qubit™ dsDNA Quantification Assay Kit following 
the manufacturers guidelines. Measurements were per -
formed using the Qubit™ 4 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific).
Results
Design of expression constructs
All factorial-based optimization experiments were car -
ried out using the enGenes e X-press V2 production 
strain, harboring a pET30a.cer plasmid containing the 
lamB_T7A3_PHL7_His expression construct. To pro -
mote extracellular expression the lamB signal sequence 
was employed to direct our enzyme into the periplasmic 
space, from where the protein can be released into the 
supernatant more easily, due to effects of outer mem -
brane leakiness [ 42] and cell lysis. The T7A3 tag was 
utilized to enhance soluble expression and overall expres-
sion levels. For easier analysis and purification during the 
optimization phase of the process, we included a C-ter -
minal hexa-histidine tag in our expression construct. 
Later results showed the need to examine the influence 
of each tag element on its own. Therefore, we generated 
three further expression constructs, lamB_PHL7_His, 
T7A3_PHL7_His and PHL7_His (see Table  2). For the 
expression of the PHL7mut3 enzyme variant we cloned 
the PHL7mut3_His construct.

Production of extracellular PHL7 in bioreactor cultivations
Initial factorial-based optimization study
For the fed-batch cultivations in benchtop bioreactors 
the three critical process parameters (CPPs) – pH, induc-
tion strength and feed rate – were varied in three levels, 
generating a design space with 27 experiments to cover 
all combinations. Reducing the number of experiments, 
we pursued a 2-level full factorial design approach with 
11 fermentation runs, the 8 corner points of our design 
space and the center point, which was run in triplicate 
(see Fig.  1C). Through the course of fermentation offline 
samples were taken for the determination of enzymatic 
terephthalic acid (TPA) release, DNA content in the 
supernatant and cell dry weight. A standardized PET 
film was incubated with diluted fermentation superna -
tant at 70  °C for 3  h and the concentration of released 
TPA monomers was measured at 240 nm. This value was 
taken as a measure of enzyme activity.
Measuring the DNA concentration in the supernatant 
of the fermentation broth gave insight on the level of cell 
lysis (see Fig. 1D). The high levels of DNA in the superna-
tant of our fermentations indicated a toxicity of our POI 
on the expression strain and lead to high viscosity of the 
samples. We also observed low separation efficiency of 
cells and supernatant through centrifugation.
Coinciding with the DNA content measurements of the 
supernatant samples were, apart from runs 2 and 3, the 
TPA release measurements. In run 3, the fermentation

with all CPPs at their highest level, the highest DNA con-
tent was recorded. This level of lysis was not matched by 
a superior enzyme activity. Experiment 2 on the other 
hand, run at the lowest CPP levels, shows an unexpect -
edly high DNA concentration. The TPA release (i.e. activ-
ity) over the course of each fermentation run can be seen 
in Fig. 1A, the highest achieved activity of each individual 
run is plotted in Fig.  1B. The fermentation experiments 
2, 6, 7 and 8 were induced by the addition of arabinose 
only. Supernatants of those four fermentations showed 
the lowest activities in the design space. By far the high -
est activity was achieved by supernatants of fermentation 
runs 4 and 9, which both were conducted at low pH (6.5) 
and high induction strength (0.8 µmol IPTG/g CDW). 
The only difference between those two fermentations was 
the feed rate, which was low in run 4 and high in experi -
ment 9. These findings raised the question whether an 
even lower pH and even higher induction strength would 
result in further improvement of activity. Therefore, the 
design space was extended to include pH6 and an induc -
tion strength of 1.2 µmol IPTG/g CDW. The feed rate was 
not extended to include a further level, as this parameter 
showed little influence.
Extended factorial-based optimization study
The center point (1) and the two best performing experi -
ments 4 and 9 of the initial design space were accom -
panied by eight further fermentations (points A - H) to 
form the extended design space (see Fig.  2C). As in the 
previous set of experiments, Fig.  2A shows the activity of 
the supernatant samples over the course of the produc -
tion phase, whereas Fig.  2B only depicts the best per -
forming sample of each fermentation run, regardless of 
the time this activity maximum was reached.
Fermentation supernatants of fermentation runs 4, 
9 and A were the only ones surpassing a TPA release 
of 12 mM in 3  h, with all other samples falling beneath 
that value. All three fermentations were conducted at 
the same pH of 6.5 and the same induction strength of 
0.8 µmol IPTG/g CDW, with just the feed rate diverg -
ing. Fermentation supernatants of experiments D and E, 
which were both obtained of fermentations carried out 
at pH 6 and an induction strength of 0.4 µmol IPTG/g 
CDW, showed the lowest activity in the extended design 
space. A combination of lowest pH and highest induction 
strength (runs C and F) yielded an improvement of the 
activity in the supernatant compared to runs D and E but 
did not outperform the fermentations at pH 6.5 and an 
induction strength of 0.8 µmol IPTG/g CDW. The high -
est DNA content in the supernatant was measured at 
the lowest tested pH, feed rate and induction strength, 
respectively, (see Fig.  2D, run D). Interestingly, the high -
est DNA content was not recorded at a combination of 
the highest levels of pH, induction strength and feed rate 
(run H) but at the intermediate level (run A).
Additionally, PET films were incubated with diluted 
fermentation supernatants of four different fermenta -
tion runs for 72 h at 70 °C and the weight loss was deter -
mined (instead of TPA release after 3  h). The first four 
runs of the extended factorial-based optimization study 
were chosen for this comparison and as Fig.  3 shows, 
the fermentation supernatant of experiment A was able 
to fully degrade the PET sample in the given time, while 
runs B, C and D only yielded 71, 54 and 43% degradation, 
respectively.
Influence of construct elements on expression an activity
Even though the factorial-based optimization study with 
the first expression construct lamB_T7A3_PHL7_His 
(control) lead to significant improvements of the fer -
mentation supernatant’s activity, still a large part of 
the enzyme was produced in inclusion bodies (IBs, see 
Fig. 4C). To evaluate the contribution of each part of our 
expression construct, lamB_PHL7_His (lamB), T7A3_
PHL7_His (T7A3) and PHL7_His (PHL7) constructs 
were cloned, expressed in 2  L benchtop reactors and 
compared to the control. The influence of the C-terminal 
His-tag was investigated in previous experiments and 
no negative impact on either expression or activity was 
found (data not shown). The lamB signal sequence was 
employed to direct the POI into the periplasmic space 
with the goal to promote the release of the enzyme into 
the supernatant, as extracellular production is preferred. 
Unfortunately, the effect of the signal sequence was a 
strong inclusion body formation and very little soluble 
enzyme production (see Fig.  4A + C). The same effect 
was also observed with other signal sequences such as 
the post translational ompA and pelB sequences, as well 
as the co-translational dsbA sequence (data not shown). 
Omitting the signal sequence resulted in complete solu -
ble POI expression, without any inclusion body forma -
tion. Still, extracellular production was achieved, due to a 
combination of the use of the growth decoupled enGenes 
eX-press V2 strain and the cell toxic nature of the POI. 
The supernatants of all four constructs were diluted and 
incubated together with a PET film sample at 70  °C for 
20 h. The supernatant of the PHL7 construct without the 
lamB leader and the T7A3 tag was able to fully degrade 
the PET film, whereas lamB, T7A3 and the control only 
achieved 48, 97 and 87% respectively (see Fig. 5).
The minimal difference in degradation efficiency 
between T7A3 and PHL7 (3%) suggests only a modest 
influence of the N-terminal tag. However, as the assay 
was concluded after 20  h without intermediate mea -
surements, it is possible that PHL7 may have reached 
complete degradation significantly earlier. Under this 
assumption, the impact of the T7A3 tag on enzymatic 
Page 8 of 15
Fohler et al. Microbial Cell Factories          (2024) 23:272 
activity could be more substantial than the final degra -
dation percentages indicate. The hypothesis that PHL7 
achieved full degradation in less than 20 h is supported 
by subsequent experiments (see Figure below), where 
PHL7 fully degraded PET in 16 h at saturation conditions 
(which were also used in this experiment). While the 
lamB leader clearly has a huge (negative) impact on sol -
uble expression (Fig.  4A + C), the T7A3 tag could impair 
the enzyme activity, as it is not cleaved off (Fig.  4B + C). 
The presence of the solubility tag at the N-terminus 
of the enzyme accounts for the significantly higher 
molecular weight bands observed in the T7A3 and con -
trol constructs compared to the lamB and PHL7 con -
structs. In any case, the PHL7 construct (Fig.  4D) with its 
completely soluble expression and superior performance 
in the weight loss assay, is the best candidate to proceed 
with.
Expression of optimized PHL7triple mutant (PHL7mut3)
In 2023 Richter et al. [ 18]. created a PHL7 variant 
(PHL7mut3) by introducing three point mutations to the 
PHL7 wild type sequence, which resulted in higher activ -
ity and temperature stability. PHL7mut3 was produced as 
PHL7mut3_His (see Table  2) under the optimized con -
ditions determined for the PHL7 wild type. After 4 h of 
induction, a clear POI band was visible in the supernatant 
fraction on the SDS-PAGE gel (Fig.  6A + B, lane 7). The 
band intensity increased until the end of fermentation

at 10  h of induction, where the maximum extracellular 
enzyme titer was reached. Many host cell proteins (HCP) 
were also visible (Fig.  6A), which indicated cell lysis. To 
purify the supernatant a heat precipitation step was per -
formed. After incubating the solution at 72 °C for 10 min 
a majority of HCPs precipitated and were separated via 
centrifugation without a significant loss of the desired 
enzyme.
The comparison of purified enzyme standard and 
unpurified fermentation supernatant at different enzyme 
loadings is shown in Fig.  7. The initial construct (lamb_
T7A3_PHL7_His), which was used for all factorial-based 
optimization fermentations, reached about 30% degrada -
tion in 16 h at an enzyme loading of 0.32 µg/mg PET. For 
the purified enzymes of both PHL7_His and PHL7mut3_
His the saturation of the PET film surface was reached 
at 0.2  µg enzyme/mg PET and 100% degradation was 
reached after 16 h of incubation at 70 °C with this load -
ing. Below the saturation point, PHL7mut3_His showed 
a slightly higher activity than PHL7. The corresponding 
unpurified fermentation supernatants show saturation at 
a marginally higher enzyme loading of 0.32  µg/mg PET 
but were still able to completely degrade the PET sam -
ple in 16 h. At an enzyme loading of 0.2 µg/mg PET the 
activity of the PHL7_His fermentation supernatant was 
decreased by about 20% compared to the purified stan -
dard, whereas the difference in activity between purified 
PHL7mut3_His and PHL7mut3_His from the fermenta -
tion supernatant was less pronounced.
Discussion
In this work we show the development of an optimized 
and scalable E. coli  process, producing the highly active 
enzymes PHL7 and PHL7mut3. As we strived to opti -
mize our process in a way that omits any purification 
steps, achieving the highest enzyme titer in combination 
with the highest enzyme activity is the goal. For the time-
resolved fermentation analysis a lot of samples had to be 
processed, therefore the TPA release in 3 h was measured 
to compare the supernatants obtained from all fermenta -
tions at all sampling time points. All samples were diluted 
with the same dilution factor, which means that the val -
ues obtained from these assays are the result of the com -
bined effects of enzyme titer and activity of the enzyme in 
the presence of potential inhibitory compounds. The TPA 
release assay was chosen over the widely used p-nitro -
phenyl butyrate (p-NPB) [ 43] assay with the argument 
of higher significance related to later applications. Mea -
suring the DNA concentration in the supernatant of the 
fermentation broth gave insight on the level of cell lysis, 
which can be an important factor for downstream pro -
cessing [ 37]. High concentrations of DNA in the super -
natant lead to high viscosity, decreased centrifugation or 
filtration performance during separation of cells and fer -
mentation supernatant and filter blockage during HPLC

product analysis of samples. We observed a correlation 
between supernatant activity and DNA content, which 
is plausible because E. coli  strains usually do not secret 
proteins and the release into the supernatant is therefore 
mostly governed by cell lysis. Effects like enzyme inhibi -
tion by other released compounds in the solution (HPCS, 
DNA, etc.) may interfere with this correlation, decreasing 
the expected activity. For this reason, the fermentation 
process was not optimized to achieve the highest enzyme 
titer but the highest activity in the supernatant.
In the initial factorial-based optimization design 
space, the fermentation supernatants of the runs 4 and 
9 achieved a TPA release of 13.62 and 13.76 mM in 3 h, 
respectively. The supernatants of all other runs yielded 
below 12 mM TPA release. This clear improvement 
resulted from fermentations at the lowest tested pH and 
the highest tested induction strength, while the feed rate 
had no apparent influence. Therefore, the effect of an 
even lower pH and higher induction strength had to be 
assessed. Extending the design space by 8 further experi -
ments secured the findings of the initial design space 
with the ideal production conditions of pH 6.5 and an 
induction strength of 0.8 µmol IPTG/g CDW.
The weight loss assays were then performed over a lon -
ger period of time with selected supernatant samples to 
show the differences in volumetric activity in a more tan -
gible way. Comparing the TPA release data after 3  h of 
incubation, experiment 1 in the initial set of experiments 
showed a performance that was in between that of runs 
B and C of the extended set. In the 72 h weight loss assay 
experiments B and C showed 71 and 54% degradation, 
respectively, while the supernatant of run A yielded a 
fully degraded PET sample. Those results indicated a 40% 
improvement of the supernatant activity compared to the 
initial process. Despite all optimization efforts, insoluble 
enzyme expression made up a considerable amount of the 
recombinant protein production. Neither reduced induc-
tion strength nor a pH shift influenced the distribution 
between soluble and insoluble expression. Usually, lower 
fermentation temperatures are advised when it comes 
to shifting recombinant protein production towards sol -
uble expression [ 44, 45]. As our production phases ran 
at 30  °C instead of 37  °C already and IB formation was 
still predominant, this strategy was clearly ineffective in 
this case. Therefore, the influence of the expression con -
struct elements was evaluated individually. As the PHL7

optimization study), D: PHL7: PHL7_His construct without lamb leader and T7A3 tag; samples were taken every 2 h for 12 h in total, starting at the point 
of induction

enzyme possesses two cysteine residues, the necessity 
of a disulfide bond formation could be assumed. In E. 
coli this post-translational modification could only be 
achieved by the oxidizing environment of the periplasm, 
making a leader sequence an obvious choice to express 
this protein [ 46, 47]. Contrary to our assumptions we 
found that directing the POI to the periplasm via a signal 
sequence caused the inclusion body formation. Omitting 
the lamb leader and consequently shifting to cytosolic 
expression resulted in the production of soluble enzyme 
only. The second part of the construct to be evaluated 
was the T7A3 solubility tag, which can also function as 
an expression enhancer [ 37]. Unlike the signal sequence 
this tag is not cleaved off by the host organism, which 
can potentially influence the enzyme activity. Moreover, 
it alters the enzyme’s molecular size, causing the POI to 
migrate a slightly shorter distance on the SDS-PAGE gel, 
aligning with HCP bands of our production strain. This

effect might cause the impression that the soluble and 
inclusion body bands of the control in Fig.  4 are more 
pronounced than the ones of the lamB samples. In fact, 
the product bands of the control are partially obscured 
by the host cell protein bands, which was also confirmed 
by mass spectrometry. Taking into account these consid -
erations, we observed no discernible impact of the T7A3 
tag on either solubility or titer when combined with this 
specific POI. The enzyme activity, however, was slightly 
reduced. Those findings lead us to select the PHL7_His 
construct for all further experiments, as soluble expres -
sion of active enzyme was our goal. Compared to the 
lamb_T7A3_PHL7_His construct, the PHL7_His fer -
mentation supernatant achieved 4-fold more PET deg -
radation at an enzyme loading of 0.2  mg/g PET in the 
16 h assay (Fig. 7). Lastly, the even more active and stable 
PHL7 triple mutant, PHL7mut3, was produced using the 
optimized expression construct and fermentation condi -
tions. The maximum titer and activity in the supernatant 
were reached after 10  h of induction, rendering this a 
time-efficient process. Simple and inexpensive purifica -
tion of the enzyme can be achieved by heat precipita -
tion of the impurities at 72  °C. This treatment is highly 
effective to obtain a purer enzyme fraction without the 
loss of our product. At the stage of TPA recovery, a 
purer enzyme fraction is advantageous because it leads 
to cleaner and whiter TPA, facilitating easier repolymer -
ization processes and ultimately enhancing the quality 
of PET. Also, heat purification and subsequent volume 
reduction or lyophilization can be beneficial when 
the enzyme has to be shipped to the recycling plant or 
stored for a prolonged period of time. As the comparison 
between purified PHL7mut3 and the fermentation super-
natant in our 16 h degradation assay shows (see Fig.  7), 
at an enzyme loading of 0.2 mg enzyme/g PET the puri -
fication would only improve the activity by 10%. At an 
enzyme loading of 0.32 mg enzyme/g PET both the puri -
fied and the unpurified enzyme degrade the PET to 100%.
To meet the global demand of enzymes for PET recy -
cling, highly active enzymes paired with a cheap, fast 
and efficient production process are key. The pitfalls for 
implementing enzymatic recycling in industry so far were 
rather low enzyme titers, hard to control production pro-
cesses, the necessity of costly downstream operations and 
slow turnover numbers of the employed enzymes, which 
means very long degradation process times. H. Seo et al. 
[23]. reports a titer of 6.2 mg/L of IsPETase secreted into 
the fermentation supernatant, while X. Wang et al. [ 21]. 
Fig. 7 Comparison of PET film degradation of purified PHL7_His standard and unpurified fermentation supernatants of the initial lamb_T7A3_PHL7_His 
and the optimized PHL7_His constructs, as well as purified PHL7mut3_His standard and unpurified PHL7mut3_His fermentation supernatants

mentioned 12 mg/L of IsPETase produced extracellularly. 
LCC titers are comparably low with 6–8  mg/L purified 
from 1  L of fermentation supernatant by S. Sulaiman 
et al. [ 22]. In this research we report extracellular titers 
of 400–500  mg/L of PHL7 and PHL7mut3. To put the 
findings of the TPA release assays into context, we com -
pared our results with those stated in literature in Table 3 
(see below). The only enzymes in this table that can to 
some extent compete with PHL7 (13 mM of monomers 
released in 3 h) are HotPETase (6.07 mM in 5 h) and LCC 
(17.4 mM in 27 h). However, despite enzyme loadings of 
3.5 and 5.7  mg/g PET for HotPETase and LCC, respec -
tively, a load over 17 times higher than with PHL7, their 
degradation performance was still inferior.
Conclusions
Utilizing a growth-decoupled bacterial host strain 
enabled resource-efficient enzyme expression. In the 
fed-batch experiments for PHL7 expression in bench -
top reactors the combination pH6.5 and an induction 
strength of 0.8 µmol IPTG/g CDM yielded the fermen -
tation supernatant with the highest activity. The feed 
rate showed negligible influence on the process. Evaluat -
ing the influence of our construct elements on enzyme 
expression and activity we showed that, in contrast to 
periplasmic expression, cytosolic expression solves the 
problem of inclusion body formation, while we were still 
able to achieve a release of our enzyme into the fermen -
tation supernatant. The developed process was adopted 
for the production of PHL7mut3. The PHL7mut3 fer -
mentation supernatant showed incredible PET degrading 
activity, with 100% degradation of a gfPET film in 16 h at 
an enzyme loading of only 0.32 mg/g PET. The combina -
tion of an enzyme as stable and capable as PHL7mut3 
together with this fast, inexpensive and scalable produc -
tion process is unmatched so far.
Still, a major issue in this production process is the 
effect of cell lysis and therefore high DNA content in the 
supernatant. Due to the high viscosity of the fermenta -
tion broth operations like centrifuging, filtering and 
separating the remaining cells and cell debris from the 
medium are next to impossible. As the fermentation 
supernatant is the product and should be easily obtained 
and processed, this is an issue that has yet to be solved.
To date, the majority of research in the field of enzy -
matic recycling focuses on enzyme engineering to gen -
erate more active and stable plastics degrading enzymes 
and undoubtedly this is a pressing topic but on the other 
hand it is just half the battle. If those discovered enzymes 
cannot be produced in economically feasible processes 
and in the amounts needed, those discoveries will never 
leave the research stage, as they can’t be implemented by 
industry. For this reason, the process development for 
producing these enzymes plays a crucial role, that should 
not be underestimated.
