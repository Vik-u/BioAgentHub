The management and recycling of plastic waste is a challenging global issue. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), 
one of the most widely used synthetic plastics, can be hydrolyzed by a series of enzymes. However, upcycling 
the resulting monomers is also a problem. In this study, we designed a co-cultivation system, in which PET 
degradation was coupled with polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) production. First, PETase from Ideonalla sakaiensis 
was expressed in Yarrowia lipolytica Po1f with a signal peptide from lipase. The engineered PETase-producing 
Y. lipolytica was conﬁrmed to hydrolyze bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) and PET powder into the 
monomers terephthalate (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG). Simultaneously, a TPA-degrading Pseudomonas stutzeri 
strain isolated from PET waste was transformed with a recombinant plasmid containing the phb CAB operon 
from Ralstonia eutropha , which encodes enzymes for the biosynthesis of PHB. The two co-cultivated engineered 
microbes could directly hydrolyze BHET to produce the bioplastic PHB in one fermentation step. During this 
process, 5.16 g/L BHET was hydrolyzed in 12 h, and 3.66 wt% PHB (3.54 g/L cell dry weight) accumulated in 
54 h. A total of 0.31g/L TPA was produced from the hydrolyzation of PET in 228 h. Although PHB could not 
be synthesized directly from PET because of the low hydrolyzing eﬃciency of PETase, this study provides a new 
strategy for the biodegradation and upcycling of PET waste by artiﬁcial microﬂora. 
1. Introduction 
The global annual production of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), 
one of the most commonly used plastics, has exceeded 30 million 
tons ( Delle Chiaie et al., 2020 ). PET is mainly used to produce var- 
ious single-use packaging materials, which become a major compo- 
nent of plastic waste after consumption ( Prata et al., 2019 ). Tradi- 
tional PET waste management methods, including mechanical recycling, 
landﬁlling, incineration, and chemical hydrolysis, have several disad- 
vantages such as reducing mechanical properties, occupying land re- 
sources, producing hazardous substances, and high energy consumption 
( Rhodes, 2018 ). Therefore, it is necessary to develop innovative schemes 
for the upcycling of enormous quantities of plastic waste ( Plastic upcy- 
cling, 2019 ). Many excellent applications inspired by natural ecosystems 
have been developed to date. Like the regenerative cycles for natural 
polymers and other waste streams, natural degradation and regenera- 
tion of plastic waste involve environmental weathering, microbial and 
enzymatic degradation, and the microbial digestion of degraded plastic 
constituents ( Nikolaivits et al., 2021 ). Therefore, developing enhanced 
microorganisms to couple the depolymerization of plastic by secreted 
enzymes and biosynthesis of high-value products from monomers is a 
promising means to realize the circular economy of plastics.

Enzymatic degradation of PET has been well studied in recent years 
( Kawai, 2021 ). PET can be hydrolyzed by hydrolases such as cuti- 
nase, lipase, esterase, and carboxylesterase because of its hydrolysable 
chemical structure ( Kawai et al., 2019 ; Carr et al., 2020 ). Some of 
the thermophilic cutinases show high degradation activity. For ex- 
ample, the cutinase from Humicola insolens (HiC) can hydrolyze low- 
crystallinity PET ﬁlm, resulting in a 97% loss of weight within 96 
h at 70 °C ( Ronkvist et al., 2009 ). A leaf-branch compost cutinase 
(LCC) has a speciﬁc PET-degrading activity of 12 mg/h/mg enzyme 
at 50 °C ( Sulaiman et al., 2012 ). The cutinase from Thermobiﬁda fusca 
KW3 (TfCut2) can degrade semi-crystalline PET ﬁlms resulting in a 
12.9% loss of weight within 48 h at 65 °C in the presence of Ca 2 + 
and Mg 2 + ( Then et al., 2015 ). In 2016, a mesophilic bacterium, Ideon- 
alla sakaiensis was isolated from a PET-contaminated site by Yoshida 
et al. It can employ PETase and MHETase to depolymerize PET into 
terephthalate (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG), which are further catab- 
olized as carbon sources. PETase is more eﬃcient than other enzymes 
in PET hydrolyzation at 30 °C, and its discovery is regarded as a mile- 
stone in PET biodegradation research ( Yoshida et al., 2016 ; Joo et al., 
2018 ; Palm et al., 2019 ; Yoshida et al., 2021 ). To increase the pro- 
duction of PETase, and thus improve the eﬃciency of converting PET 
into monomers, there have been many attempts to express and secrete 
PETase heterologously in diﬀerent hosts. Huang et al. successfully engi- 
neered Bacillus subtilis 168 to produce functional PETase with its native 
signal peptide by inactivating the Tat components ( Huang et al., 2018 ).

Seo et al. used Escherichia coli to express and secrete PETase with the Sec- 
dependent translocation signal peptide of maltoporin ( Seo et al., 2019 ). 
Shi et al. engineered the signal peptide of pelB through random mutage- 
nesis to improve the secretion eﬃciency of PETase in E. coli ( Shi et al., 
2021 ). However, the degradation of PET by these systems during fer- 
mentation was not studied. 
In natural processes, plastic depolymerization products are reduced 
to CO 2 and water after microbial digestion, resulting in resource loss and 
carbon emissions. Therefore, as mentioned above, research in high-value 
product biosynthesis from monomers is essential to move the disposal of 
waste plastic toward a circular economy. It has been demonstrated that 
the PET monomer TPA is a suitable building block for the biosynthesis 
of several value-added compounds. For example, TPA from pyrolyzed 
or enzymatically degraded PET has been used as a feedstock for pro- 
duction of the bioplastic polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) by Pseudomonas 
umsongensis GO16, which was isolated from soil exposed to PET granules 
( Kenny et al., 2008 ; Narancic et al., 2021 ; Tiso et al., 2021 ). E. coli also 
has been engineered to produce the value-added small molecule vanillin 
using TPA through enzymatic degradation of PET by LCC ( Sadler and 
Wallace, 2021 ). These studies revealed a novel scheme for PET upcy- 
cling, which circumvents the costly puriﬁcation of PET monomers. How- 
ever, there have been no examples of performing the enzymatic hydrol- 
ysis of PET and the bioconversion of TPA simultaneously, which can 
further simplify the process and save costs. 
Yarrowia lipolytica , one of the most extensively studied “non- 
conventional ”a n d dimorphic yeasts, can naturally secrete several en- 
zymes such as proteases, lipases, esterases, and RNases, and is currently 
used as a model for the study of protein secretion ( Baghban et al., 2019 ; 
Park et al., 2019 ). Therefore, in this study we designed a co-cultivation 
system using Y. lipolytica to achieve the coupling of PET degradation 
and polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) production ( Fig. 1 ). Firstly, we engi- 
neered a PETase-expressing Y. lipolytica strain by fusing a PETase vari- 
ant ( Son et al., 2019 ) with the endogenous signal peptide of lipase 2. 
At the same time, a TPA-catabolizing strain, Pseudomonas stutzeri , iso- 
lated from PET waste was engineered to produce PHB from TPA. Finally, 
co-cultivation of the two engineered strains led to direct hydrolysis of 
bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) to produce PHB. This study 
provides a full bioprocess strategy for the biodegradation and upcycling 
of PET waste. 
2. Materials and methods 
2.1. Strains and media 
E. coli DH5 𝛼 was cultured at 37 °C and used as the host to construct 
plasmids. Y. lipolytica Po1f was cultured at 30 °C and used as the host for 
the secretory expression of PETase. P. stutzeri TPA3 is a TPA-catabolizing 
strain isolated from PET waste and was metabolically engineered to pro- 
duce PHB from TPA in our previous study ( Liu et al., 2021 ). 
LB (5 g/L yeast extract, 10 g/L tryptone, and 10 g/L NaCl) was used 
for conventional cultivation of E. coli DH5 𝛼 and P. stutzeri TPA3. YPD (10 
g/L yeast extract, 20 g/L tryptone, and 20 g/L glucose) was used for con- 
ventional cultivation of Y. lipolytica Po1f, and Minimal SD Base (TaKaRa, 
China) with leucine dropout amino acid mixes was used for Y. lipoly- 
tica Po1f transformant selection. Mineral medium (0.85 g/L NaNO 3 , 
0.66 g/L (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4, 5.37 g/L K 2 HPO 4 • 3H 2 O, 2.26 g/L KH 2 PO 4 , 3.34 
g/L Na 2 HPO 4 , 2.53 g/L NaH 2 PO 4 • 2H 2 O, 0.4 g/L MgSO 4 • 7H 2 O, and 
0.1% trace elements) with BHET and glucose was used for the co- 
cultivation of P. stutzeri TPA3P and Y. lipolytica Po1fP. The stock trace 
elements solution consisted of 5 g/L MnCl 2 • 4H 2 O, 1.5 g/L CuSO 4 • 5H 2 O, 
50 g/L Na 2 EDTA, 1.0 g/L (NH 4 ) 6 Mo 7 O 24 • 4H 2 O, 5.5 g/L CaCl 2 , 20 g/L 
ZnSO 4 • 7H 2 O, 5.0 g/L FeSO 4 • 7H 2 O, 1.61 g/L CoCl 2 • 5H 2 O. If necessary, 
the appropriate antibiotics were added to the medium at the following 
concentrations: ampicillin, 100 mg/L; hygromycin (hyg) B, 1000 mg/L; 
and kanamycin 25 mg/L. The solid medium was supplemented with 20 
g/L agar. 
2.2. Plasmid construction and strain engineering 
The DNA polymerases and restriction enzymes used in this work 
were purchased from TaKaRa (Beijing, China) and Thermo Fisher Sci- 
entiﬁc (Shanghai, China) respectively. Plasmids were assembled using 
MultiF Seamless Assembly Mix (ABclonal) according to the manufac- 
turer’s instructions. The codon optimized gene of the PETase variant 
( Son et al., 2019 ) was synthesized by GeneralBio, China. To randomly 
integrate the PETase gene into the Y. lipolytica Po1f genome ( Cui et al., 
2018 ), the target fragment was ampliﬁed using primers PETase F and 
PETase R ( Table 1 ) which contain the homology regions with the vec- 
tor pKi-hyg ( Table 2 ). The constructed plasmid was digested with Not Ⅰ 
and transformed into Y. lipolytica Po1f using the commonly used lithium 
acetate method ( Cui et al., 2018 ). Transformants were selected on YPD- 
hyg plates. 
To investigate the eﬀect of signal peptides on the secretion of PETase, 
DNA fragments of SP LIP2 , SP EXG1 , SP XPR2 , and SP RNY1 ( Table 3 ) were 
cloned in frame with the N-terminus of mature PETase using PCR ex- 
tension with the corresponding primers ( Darvishi et al., 2018 ). The epi- 
somal vector YLEP-leu was digested by Bsp119 Ⅰ and assembled with 
the target fragments ﬂanked by the corresponding homologous arms. 
The constructed plasmids were then transformed into Y. lipolytica Po1f. 
Transformants were selected on leucine dropout plates.

2.3. Enzyme assays 
Y. lipolytica Po1f-derived strains were cultured in YPD at 220 
rpm and 30 °C for 72 h. The culture supernatants were harvested by 
centrifugation at 8500 rpm for 20 min at 4 °C. Before sodium do- 
decyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analy- 
sis, the samples were concentrated 20-fold using a 10 K centrifu- 
gal ﬁlter at 4 °C. Enzyme assays for BHET were performed in 20 
mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.0) with 4 mM BHET and a speciﬁc amount of 
crude enzyme supernatant, which corresponded to the same amount 
of biomass (V supernatant /V total = 1.295/OD 600 ) at 30 °C. Two paral- 
lel experiments were carried out in each assay. To stop the reac- 
tion, an equal volume of acetonitrile was added to the sample. The 
samples were centrifuged and ﬁltered with a 0.22 μm ﬁlter mem- 
brane, and then analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography 
(HPLC). 
2.4. BHET plate transparent ring experiment 
BHET powder sterilized by ultraviolet irradiation was added to high- 
temperature steam-sterilized mineral medium with 20 g/L glucose and 
the supplementary nutrients leucine and uracil, and stirred to prepare 
emulsiﬁed BHET medium. The medium was mixed with a melted sterile 
agar solution to prepare emulsiﬁed BHET plates. Strains were spread on 
the emulsiﬁed BHET plates for cultivation, and the formation of trans- 
parent rings was observed after 48 h. 
2.5. PHB detection by Nile red staining 
To detect the production of PHB, 0.2% (v/v) of 2 mM Nile red dye 
(BBI, China) dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide was added to sterilized min- 
eral medium containing 10 g/L TPA and 20 g/L agar ( Spiekermann et al., 
1999 ). Strains were spread on the plates for cultivation. Plates were pho- 
tographed in a chemiluminescence imaging system (Clinx ChemiScope 
6000 Pro). Colonies of PHB-accumulating strains ﬂuoresce under a 530 
nm ﬂuorescent light source and 590 nm ﬁlter. 
2.6. Production of PHB from BHET by co-cultivation of PETase and 
PHB-producing strains 
Co-cultivation of PETase- and PHB-producing strains was carried out 
in mineral medium containing 10 g/L glucose, 5 g/L BHET, and the 
supplementary nutrients leucine and uracil at 30 °C and 220 rpm. The 
growth of the PETase-producing strains was characterized by counting 
the number of colonies on YPD plates containing ampicillin and that 
of the PHB-producing strains by counting the number of colonies on 
TPA plates without another carbon source. BHET, MHET, and TPA were 
detected by HPLC, and PHB was quantiﬁed using gas chromatography 
(GC). Three parallel cultivations were carried out in the experiment. 
2.7. The hydrolysis of PET by PETase-expressing Y. lipolytica Po1f 
The hydrolysis of PET by PETase-expressing Y. lipolytica Po1f was 
carried out in mineral medium containing 20 g/L glucose and the sup- 
3

plementary nutrients leucine and uracil at 30 °C and 220 rpm. Com- 
mercial PET powder (particle size: 300 μm, Alibaba) was sterilized by 
ultraviolet light for 12 h in a vertical clean bench and then added to the 
medium to a ﬁnal concentration of approximately 10 g/L. Two parallel 
cultivations were carried out in the experiment. 
2.8. Substrate and product analysis 
BHET, MHET, and TPA were detected by an HPLC system equipped 
with an Agilent ZORBAX Extend-C18 column (4.6 × 150 mm). The mo- 
bile phase containing 0.1% (v/v) triﬂuoroacetic acid and 20% (v/v) ace- 
tonitrile was used as the mobile phase. The ﬂow rate and column tem- 
perature were set to 0.8 mL/min and 40 °C, respectively. The eﬄuent 
was monitored by a photodiode array detector at a wavelength of 240 
nm. 
When detecting EG, a Bio-Rad Aminex HPX-87H column (7.8 × 300 
mm) and a refractive index detector were used. H 2 SO 4 (5 mM) was used 
as the mobile phase. The ﬂow rate and column temperature were set to 
0.6 mL/min and 65 °C, respectively. 
PHB was detected by a GC system equipped with a Restek Rtx-5 col- 
umn and an AOC-20i auto injector. The culture was centrifuged at 8000 
rpm and 4 °C for 30 min to harvest the cells. The cells were weighed 
after lyophilization. Then, 150 μL H 2 SO 4 , 850 μL CH 3 OH, and 1 mL 
CHCl 3 were sequentially added to 15–20 mg cells and reacted at 100 °C 
for 1 h. Subsequently, the reaction ﬂasks were removed from heat and 
1 ml distilled water was added for stratiﬁcation. The lower chloroform 
phase with the substance to be detected was taken for GC detection. The 
following detection procedure was used: (1) 80 °C for 1 min; (2) then 
ramped up from 80 °C to 120 °C at a rate of 10 °C/min, (3) then ramped 
up to 160 °C at a rate of 45 °C/min and held at a constant temperature 
for 5 min ( Li et al., 2020 ). 
3. Results 
3.1. Engineering Y. lipolytica Po1f for the secretory expression of 
functional PETase 
To achieve the degradation of PET, Y. lipolytica Po1f was used to 
express and secrete PETase from I. sakaiensis with its native signal pep- 
tide. The commercial dimer BHET, which contains two ester bonds, was 
selected as a representative substrate for the study of PETase activity. 
We observed that BHET emulsion became apparently transparent after 
incubating with the crude enzyme supernatant of PETase, but it was 
still turbid when incubated with the crude enzyme supernatant of wide- 
type Y. lipolytica Po1f or Tris-HCl buﬀer ( Fig. 2 A). This phenomenon 
indicated that the BHET was hydrolyzed by PETase secreted from the 
engineered Y. lipolytica Po1f. HPLC analysis showed obvious MHET for- 
mation in the reaction medium, while the BHET peak decreased, fur- 
ther demonstrated the hydrolysis of BHET occurred ( Fig. 2 B). To pro- 
vide further proof for this conclusion, SDS-PAGE analysis of PETase in 
the culture supernatant was performed. Although Y. lipolytica produced 
many endogenous extracellular proteins, a darker band of the same size 
as PETase (approximately 28 kDa) was observed in the culture super- 
natant of the engineered Y. lipolytica Po1f, which indicated the secretory 
expression of PETase ( Fig. 2 C). Furthermore, when strains were cultured 
on emulsiﬁed BHET plates for 72 h, transparent rings formed around the 
colonies of PETase-expressing Y. lipolytica Po1f colonies, whereas there 
were no transparent rings around the colonies of the non-engineered 
strain ( Fig. 2 D). The results indicated that Y. lipolytica can express and 
secrete PETase, and it can hydrolyze BHET during cultivation at 30 °C. 
3.2. Optimization of the secretory expression of PETase 
To maximize the secretory expression of PETase, four endogenous 
Y. lipolytica signal peptides (SP LIP2 , SP EXG1 , SP XPR2 , and SP RNY1 ) were 
individually fused to the N-terminus of mature PETase to mediate its 
extracellular secretion. The native signal peptide SP PETase was used as 
a control. The amino acid sequences of the signal peptides are shown 
in Table 3 . The episomal plasmid YLEP-leu was used for expression to 
reduce the impact of gene copy number. The eﬀects of the signal pep- 
tides on the activity and secretion of PETase were evaluated. SP LIP2 of 
the extracellular lipase encoded by the Lip2 gene resulted in the most 
secretion of PETase, followed by SP XPR2 , SP RNY1 , and SP EXG1 . The na- 
tive signal peptide SP PETase had the worst performance, resulting in 
the lowest BHET activity ( Fig. 3 ABC). Next, the SP LIP2 -fused PETase 
gene was randomly integrated into the genome of Y. lipolytica Po1f in 
a homology-independent manner to generate variation in the chromo- 
somal location and copy number, resulting in expression diﬀerences in 
the PETase gene. In this way, an optimized engineered strain with high 
extracellular PETase activity was obtained and named Y. lipolytica Po1fP 
( Fig. 3 D). Interestingly, MHET produced from BHET was further decom- 
posed to generate TPA during the enzyme assays ( Fig. 3 CD). However, 
previous studies showed that PETase has no catalytic activity on MHET 
( Yoshida et al., 2016 ; Knott et al., 2020 ). 
3.3. Production of PHB from the monomer TPA by P. stutzeri TPA3P 
Although PETase-producing Y. lipolytica can hydrolyze BHET to pro- 
duce TPA, TPA cannot be further metabolized by Y. lipolytica (Fig. 
S1AB). Therefore, an upcycling process should be incorporated. In our 
previous study, a TPA-catabolizing strain, P. stutzeri TPA3, was isolated 
from PET waste; however, this strain did not accumulate any type of 
PHA ( Liu et al., 2021 ). Genomic analysis indicated that P. stutzeri TPA3 
employs a dioxygenase (tphA 2 A 3 A 1 ) and a dehydrogenase (tphB) to con- 
vert TPA to protocatechuate (PCA), which is subsequently metabolized 
to produce succinyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA through the PCA 3,4-cleavage 
pathway ( Schlaﬂi et al., 1994 ; Choi et al., 2005 ; Sasoh et al., 2006 ). 
Therefore, it is possible to metabolically engineer P. stutzeri TPA3 to 
produce PHB from TPA through the heterogenous expression of phb CAB 
genes ( Fig. 1 ). Therefore, we cloned the phb CAB operon from Ralsto- 
nia eutropha ( Li et al., 2011 ; Kang et al., 2008 ). Nile red staining and GC 
analysis proved that the engineered strain P. stutzeri TPA3P can produce 
PHB ( Fig. 4 ). In a shake ﬂask, P. stutzeri TPA3P accumulated 11.56 wt% 
of cell dry weight PHB from 10 g/L TPA as the sole carbon source. 
3.4. Co-cultivation of the two engineered strains for the production of PHB 
To couple the generation of TPA from PET with PHB production, 
Y. lipolytica Po1fP was co-cultivated with P. stutzeri TPA3P using glu- 
cose and BHET as carbon sources. The glucose metabolism of P. stutzeri 
TPA3P was found to be weak in our trial experiments (Fig. S1F). As 
shown in Figure 5 A, glucose was metabolized slowly during the ﬁrst 
12 h, and 10 g/L glucose was consumed by the two strains within 30 
h. This is similar to the amount consumed when culturing Y. lipolytica 
Po1f alone (Fig. S1C). Therefore, Y. lipolytica Po1fP may utilize most of 
the glucose for growth and the secretory expression of PETase. The two 
strains were inoculated at an equal OD, and the initial OD value at 600 
nm of the co-culture system was 0.1 for each strain. Colony count results 
showed that the two strains coexist well during co-cultivation ( Fig. 5 C). 
The secreted PETase completely hydrolyzed BHET to produce MHET 
within 12 h ( Fig. 5 B). Thereafter, MHET gradually decreased, while 
TPA and EG began to accumulate in the medium. The produced TPA 
provided a carbon source for the subsequent rapid growth of P. stutzeri 
TPA3P. However, the biomass of P. stutzeri TPA3P declined sharply in 
the ﬁnal stage of cultivation, which may be due to the shortage of TPA 
and the cell sedimentation of unknown cause ( Fig. 5 BC). In terms of the 
accumulation of PHB, the cells dry weight was 5.60 g/L containing 0.22 
wt% PHB at 29 h, while the values at 54 h were 3.54 g/L and 3.66 wt% 
( Fig. 5 A). This indicated that PHB was produced from TPA by P. stutzeri 
TPA3P. 
We also tested the direct degradation of PET by Y. lipolytica Po1fP.

the medium until 120 h, and the yields of TPA only reached 0.31 g/L in 
228 h ( Fig. 5 D). No obvious accumulation of PHB was detected during 
the co-cultivation of Y. lipolytica Po1fP with P. stutzeri TPA3P, probably 
due to the low TPA accumulation. 
4. Discussion 
In this study, we successfully engineered an unconventional yeast, 
Y. lipolytica , to eﬀectively express and secrete functional PETase. The 
signal peptide of an endogenous Y. lipolytica lipase (SP LIP2 ) was used 
to maximize protein secretion. In vitro, 3.68 mM BHET was hydrolyzed 
in 1 h using the crude enzyme supernatant of Y. lipolytica Po1f (YLEP- 
leu-SP LIP2 PETase), while 1 mM BHET was hydrolyzed in 2 h by crude 
enzyme supernatant of a previously reported E. coli system ( Shi et al., 
2021 ). Moreover, unlike E. coli , the yeast expression system does not 
require the addition of inducers, which reduces the production cost of 
enzymes. 
The degradation of BHET in the culture medium by the optimized 
strain Y. lipolytica Po1fP was also studied; this strain can hydrolyze 
20 mM BHET within 12 h during cultivation. Interestingly, we also 
found that MHET, which was generated from the hydrolysis of BHET 
by PETase, can be further decomposed into the monomers TPA and EG. 
As it was previously reported that Lip7 has a higher substrate preference 
for shorter chain length esters ( Fickers et al., 2011 ), we hypothesize that 
the hydrolysis of MHET may be due to the nonspeciﬁc reaction of en- 
dogenous extracellular lipases or esterases of Y. lipolytica. Thus, another 
advantage of using Y. lipolytica as a host for heterologous expression of 
PETase for the degradation of PET is that it does not require additional 
expression of MHETase. 
To couple the generation of TPA with PHB production, P. stutzeri 
TPA3P, a TPA-degrading strain identiﬁed in our previous study, was en- 
gineered to produce PHB without induction and was co-cultured with 
PETase-expressing Y. lipolytica . The co-cultivation system was designed 
based on the fact that Y. lipolytica cannot utilize TPA, while P. stutzeri 
TPA3P has a very weak glucose utilization capability. Both engineered 
strains maintained high activity in the co-cultivation system. TPA gen- 
erated from the hydrolysis of BHET by Y. lipolytica Po1fP was ﬁnally 
utilized by P. stutzeri TPA3P for growth and to synthesize PHB.

stronger ﬂuorescence than the wild-type strain. B, PHB was quantiﬁed using gas 
chromatography. 3-HB, methyl-(R)-3-hydroxybutyrate. 
However, the yield of PHB was not satisfactory. One reason is that 
in this proof-of-concept study, P. stutzeri TPA3P was not optimized with 
regards to PHB production. The vector pBBR1MCS-2, which was used 
for the heterologous expression of the phb CAB genes, is a medium-copy- 
number plasmid ( Kovach et al., 1995 ; Perez-Pantoja et al., 2000 ). This 
may limit the expression of the phb CAB genes, resulting in low capa- 
bility of the strain to synthesize PHB. Another more important reason 
is that the hydrolysis of PET using PETase at room temperature is still 
ineﬃcient, resulting in TPA being produced in limited amounts that are 
not enough for PHB synthesis. Although many PETase mutants with 
improved properties have been reported, such as Ts-PETase ( Zhong- 
Johnson et al., 2021 ), DuraPETase ( Cui et al., 2021 ), and a double 
point mutant ( Meng et al., 2021 ), the eﬃciency of PET degradation at 
room temperature remains the main limitation. Therefore, more work 
should be carried out to improve the activity, stability, and production 
of PETase. In addition, PET is easily hydrolyzed by enzymes at the glass 
transition temperature ( Tournier et al., 2020 ; Kawai, 2021 ) because its 
amorphous region becomes ﬂexible, which improves the accessibility 
of enzymes ( Alves et al., 2002 ). Based on this consensus, many eﬀorts 
have been devoted to improving the thermostability of PET hydrolases 
through protein engineering. One example of the great progress that has 
been made is that LCC variants with higher thermostability (improve- 
ment of melting temperatures ranging from 9.3 °C to 13.4 °C) depolymer- 
ized 90% of PET into monomers within 10 h at 72 °C ( Tournier et al., 
2020 ). Therefore, the development of thermophilic enzyme expression 
systems is also a feasible solution. For example, in 2020 Yan et al. genet- 
ically engineered Clostridium thermocellum to express the thermophilic 
cutinase LCC and degrade commercial PET ﬁlms during a batch cultiva- 
tion at 60 °C; more than 60% of the PET ﬁlm was converted into soluble 
monomer feedstocks after 14 days ( Yan et al., 2020 ). 
In conclusion, we demonstrated the possibility of co-cultivating two 
engineered microbes to achieve the simultaneous degradation and upcy-

microﬂora may play an important role in the biodegradation of synthetic
