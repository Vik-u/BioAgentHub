PETases are enzymes that can break down the poly-ethylene terephthalate (PET) polymer in its 
constituent building blocks. This enzymatic recycling process offers a sustainable solution for 
producing new, high-quality plastics from previously used materials. NMR spectroscopy can help in 
understanding and ultimately improving these enzymes but is always confronted with the lengthy 
step of acquisition and interpretation of triple resonance spectra for the spectral assignment. Here, 
we explore whether this step can be made more efficient by recording the spectra directly at high 
temperature, which simultaneously corresponds to more realistic working conditions for the enzyme. 
Taking the inactive variant of LCCICCG as an example, we compare spectral quality at 30°C and 50°C, 
and find that the latter condition greatly improves the Signal-to-Noise (S/N) ratio of the standard triple 
resonance spectra. Going up to 60°C, we show that pulse sequences mainly used for the assignment 
of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) also become feasible. As a result, we present a methodology 
enabling exhaustive backbone assignment based on a minimal set of triple resonance spectra acquired 
and analysed in less than two weeks. The assignment process hence can be completed on a time scale 
comparable to crystallography, bringing NMR in a favourable position to contribute to bio-structural 
studies on this family of highly thermostable PETases.
 Among analytical techniques, biomolecular Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) stands out as an exceptionally 
versatile approach for probing the structure, function and dynamics of biomolecules, with particular strength in 
enzyme characterization1,2. Nevertheless, recent advances in structural biology, including the rapid progress of 
cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM)3, the continued improvements in X-ray crystallography4,5 and the rise of 
powerful computational modelling have reshaped how researchers obtain structural insights into proteins6. This 
paradigm shift has, in turn, posed new challenges for biomolecular NMR spectroscopy, compelling the field to 
refine its identity and emphasize the unique advantages it offers7,8. Despite demanding initial stages, which often 
require specialized NMR facilities for tasks such as sample preparation (including stable isotope labeling), data 
acquisition through multiple triple- resonance experiments and complex data analysis like resonance assignment, 
biomolecular NMR provides an unparalleled ability to probe mechanistic details of enzymes at atomic level 
directly in solution 9. In the past decades, important breakthroughs have continued to push the boundaries 
of what is achievable. Innovations include cell-free labeling systems 10, more efficient data acquisition (Non-
Uniform Sampling11, SO-FAST12), automated resonance assignment procedures13–15 and integrative approaches 
that combine NMR with artificial intelligence (AI) to address long-standing challenges 16,17. Contemporary 
NMR spectroscopy clearly needs to take the best of these advances to open up to new horizons.
In the field of biotechnology, enzyme optimization is for many programs the key towards the success of 
bio-based approaches18. Computational methods based on artificial intelligence 19,20 thereby can generate huge 
libraries of potential candidates, and coupled to high-throughput screening methods 21, have the potential 
to rapidly converge upon improved enzymes. If NMR spectroscopy wants to participate in this effort – and 
convince that its site-specific information is most useful for example to restrict the list of potential mutation 
sites for directed evolution9,22, obtaining a fully assigned 1H-15N spectrum as rapidly as possible seems a strict 
requirement.
One recent example where enzymes are at the core of a promising industrial process is bio-enzymatic recycling 
of plastic23. PET hydrolases (PETases) break the ester linkages in polyethylene terephthalate (PET), a common

plastic used in the manufacturing of beverage bottles, food containers or clothing fibers. In this rapidly evolving 
field, many newly identified PETase enzymes from diversity24 have been screened and used as starting points for 
further engineering. It proved essential to work close to the PET glass temperature of ~ 70°C, where the plastic 
becomes more dynamic at the molecular level without yet crystallizing 25. The temperature of denaturation of 
the enzymes thereby has become an important factor next to their intrinsic catalytical efficacy. The initially 
mesophilic Ideonella sakaiensis (Is) PETase26 with its Tm of 46.1°C was evolved to become the ThermoPETase 
(Tm 58.6°C; Son et al.27), FastPETase (Tm 56.9°C; Lu et al.28), DepoPETase (Tm 69.4°C; Shi et al.29), DuraPETase 
(Tm 78.7°C; Cui et al.30) and finally HotPETase (Tm 82.5°C; Bell et al.31). Derived from the thermophilic Leaf-
branch Compost Cutinase (LCC)32, a thermostable cutinase characteristic from the type I group33, its quadruple 
mutant LCCICCG was equally optimized based on its activity as well as its thermostability (Tm = 85.8°C for LCC 
and 93.3°C for LCCICCG at pH 8, both proteins without C-terminal His-tag)23. The latter enzyme has shown great 
promise for industrial application of plastic recycling34,35.
From an NMR standpoint, this high thermostability could be - at least in theory- a significant advantage, 
as spectral recording at higher temperatures should lead to faster tumbling of the enzyme and hence mimic a 
lower molecular weight species. Here, taking the catalytically inactive S165A variant of LCCICCG as an example, 
we explore the possibility to facilitate the resonance assignment of the thermophilic PETases by recording a 
set of 3D experiments directly at higher temperatures. We first measure experimentally the global tumbling 
time (τc) at different temperatures, and find a twofold reduction already when going from 30°C to 50°C. When 
comparing spectra at 30°C, temperature where we obtained our first assignments 36, and similar experiments 
recorded at 50°C, we find that the standard triple resonance experiments work significantly better at 50°C, with 
an important gain in Signal-to-Noise (S/N) ratio and hence reduction in spectral recording time. We equally 
find that additional experiments based on the hNcaNNH and HncaNNH pulse sequences 37, mostly used for 
assignment of highly flexible Intrinsically Disordered Proteins (IDPs) although equally applied with success to 
some larger enzymes after complete deuteration38,39, become feasible without any deuteration, and this despite 
the 30 kDa MW range of the enzymes. Based on this observation, we achieve de novo backbone assignment 
of an active variant of LCC ICCG primarily based on the resulting 15N and 1HN connectivities. Within 6 days of 
data acquisition followed by 3 days of data analysis, nearly 75% of the 15N/1HN resonances were assigned. Such 
achievement should enable NMR to follow protein design at a pace at least comparable to X-ray crystallography 
and alleviate the bottleneck of resonance assignment in large scale projects involving thermostable enzymes.
Materials and methods
Protein expression and purification
LCCICCG-S165A and its active variant were expressed and purified according to previous studies36,40.
NMR spectroscopy
LCCICCG-S165A
All experiments recorded for backbone assignment at 50°C were acquired on a 800 MHz spectrometer equipped 
with a 5-mm cryoprobe with pulsed field z-gradients. The sample contained 580 µM of 15N-13C labeled protein 
in 25 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.5 with 100 mM NaCl. The data presented here were recorded using the standard 
Bruker library pulse sequences: 2D 1H-15N HSQC, HNCACB and HNCO. All spectra were processed using 
Topspin 4.0.8 (Bruker Biospin). Spectral analysis for backbone assignments was performed manually using 
POKY41. One important experimental factor we found when measuring at higher temperatures is the necessity to 
seal the sample. Otherwise, already after a day, evaporation set in and shim quality rapidly deteriorated. Spectral 
dimensions for the HNCO experiments were 3622 Hz (F1) × 2919 Hz (F2) × 12500 Hz (F3) corresponding to 18 
× 36 × 15.6224 ppm, with sampling durations of 15.5 ms (t1), 10.9 ms (t2), 160 ms (t3). Spectra were centered at 
4.7 ppm (1H), 117.5 ppm (15N), 173 ppm (13CO). Spectral settings for the HNCACB experiment were 6438.5 Hz 
(F1) × 2919 Hz (F2) × 14084.25 Hz (F2) corresponding to 32 × 36 × 50 ppm, with sampling durations of 14.9 ms 
(t1), 10.9 ms (t 2), 0.009 ms (t 3). Spectra were centered at 4.7 ppm ( 1H), 117.5 ppm ( 15N), 40 ppm ( 13Cα). Both 
experiments were acquired with 4 scans per increment.
Active variant of LCCICCG
Experiments were recorded at 60 °C on a sample containing 600 µM of 15N-13C labeled of the active variant of 
LCCICCG in 25 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.5 with 100 mM NaCl on a 900 MHz spectrometer equipped with a 
5-mm cryoprobe with pulsed field z-gradients with the parameters shown in Table 1:
NUS percentages were estimated based on the number of resonances expected in each dataset. Data were 
reconstructed using standard MDD software 42. Spectral analysis and backbone assignments were performed 
manually using CcpNmr analysis software v2.543.
TRACT analysis
TRACT spectra were recorded with the pulse sequence of Lee et al., implemented as individual experiments for 
the α and β 15N spin states44. A relaxation delay of 3 s was used between scans, and 4k points were recorded. A 
total of 24 delays ranging from 1 to 200 ms were sampled as increments in a pseudo-2D matrix and recorded 
with 512 scans per delay. After manual phasing and baseline correction, the integral of the [10.0-6.4] ppm region 
was determined and plotted as a function of the corresponding delay. The resulting curve was fitted as a mono-
exponentially decaying function, and the difference between the rates of both components was interpreted in 
terms of τc as described by Robson et al.45.
Theoretical calculus of the τc value as a function of temperature was performed by fixing the τ c value at the 
experimentally determined value of 13 ns for 30°C, and then applying the following formula46 :

where ηT is the viscosity of water at the temperature T (using the Celsius scale). The latter was calculated using

and does not consider that our protein sample was not in pure water but rather in 25mM Tris-HCl and 100mM 
NaCl buffer pH 7.5.
Results
Determination of τc as function of temperature
The global tumbling time τc (or, strictly speaking, the correlation time of the dipolar autocorrelation function of a 
given amide H-N vector49) is one criterium that determines the linewidth of the corresponding amide correlation 
peak. Other factors such as chemical exchange of the amide protons with water or the presence of dynamics in 
the intermediate time scale regime can equally contribute. Whereas the ratio of transverse ( T2) to longitudinal 
(T1) relaxation times can be used to estimate this τ c parameter50, the increasing influence of intramolecular 
motions on the T1 relaxation time for larger proteins51 has motivated the development of an alternative method. 
The TRACT (TRosy for rotAtional Correlation Times) method measures the decay of both TROSY and anti-
TROSY components of the 15N doublet44, and translates the differential rate into a value of τc without interference 
of dipole–dipole (DD) relaxation by remote protons or relaxation contributions from chemical exchange 44,45. 
TRACT experiments on the LCCICCG-S165A enzyme were recorded at various temperatures ranging from 30°C 
to 60°C. By integrating the envelope of the proton spectra over the amide region as a function of the relaxation 
delay, both (TROSY and anti-TROSY) relaxation rates were obtained using an exponential minimization (Fig. 
1. A & B). The difference between both rates (Δ R2) was interpreted using the equation given by Robson and 
coauthors45 and yielded τc values varying from 13 to 5.7 ns upon increasing the temperature from 30°C to 60°C 
(Fig. 1. C). The reduction of τ c is expected, and follows well the temperature dependence of water viscosity 
expected for a rigid body of this size 46 (Fig. 1.D). The small discrepancy at higher temperature could come 
for the buffer and salt concentrations influencing the viscosity 52. Importantly, accelerated tumbling predicts a 
significant decrease in transverse relaxation rates for both amide and Cα resonances53, thereby reducing the need 
for (partial) deuteration of the sample. We show here that because of this superior sensitivity, nearly complete 
assignment of the backbone and side chain spectra of LCC ICCG-S165A can be obtained with a minimal set of 
experiments recorded at 50°C (Mathematical details are given in in the methods section).
 
Influence of the temperature on spectral quality
To evaluate experimentally the influence of temperature on the spectral quality of our PETase, we recorded 
on the same sample at 30°C and 50°C both the 1H-15N HSQC and 1H-15N TROSY correlation spectra using 
standard Bruker pulse programs (hsqcf3gpph19 and trosyf3gpph19). Already at 30°C, signal intensity improved

by ~ 40% when comparing the HSQC experiment with the TROSY version, and going to 50°C clearly boosted 
the intensity gain by another ~ 15% (Fig.  2.A). Equally important, the number of peaks in the 2D correlation 
spectra remained nearly the same between spectra recorded at both temperatures (Fig.  2.B), indicating limited 
solvent exchange.
Further time-saving could be obtained by BEST-54 or SOFAST-12 HSQC sequences and should therefore be 
considered before setting up any triple resonance experiment. However, the reduced spin-diffusion at higher 
temperatures should diminish the difference between selective and non-selective relaxation after excitation 
of the amide proton pool, which is the underlying principle of these pulse sequences 36. Moreover, due to the 
presence of extreme 1H chemical shifts for some amide protons of LCCICCG (reaching 10.9 ppm or 5.6 ppm), the 
use of these schemes in our particular case led to the loss of ~ 10 resonances (Figure S1), and was therefore not 
pursued in the present study. In accordance with the lower τc value, NOE based magnetization transfer proved 
slower at 50°C than at 30°C55, but should simultaneously suffer less from spin diffusion (Figure S2).
In a typical backbone assignment experiment (e.g. HNCACB), the lengthy back-transfer of 13Cα to 15N 
magnetization is often a limiting step due to the rapid relaxation of the 13Cα transverse magnetization. While in 
a HMQC experiment, this loss is amplified by the short 1H transverse relaxation time, the HSQC experiment 
is less impacted as the 1H magnetization is stored along the z-axis and the 1H T1 is long . This is exemplified 
when comparing 1H-13C HMQC and HSQC at 30°C where one can clearly see the increased number of visible 
resonances in the HSQC experiment (Figure S3). To evaluate how beneficial spectral recording at 50°C would 
be, we then measured 1H-13CHSQC spectra with a wide 13C spectral window both at 30°C and 50°C (Fig. 2.C). 
Relative to the isolated methyl signal of M166 56, we observe a nearly 40% increase in intensity for 1Hα-13Cα 
resonances in the spectrum recorded at 50°C compared to that at 30°C. To evaluate the effect this has on triple 
resonance spectra, we acquired a series of 1H-13C planes from HNCO, HNcaCO and HNCACB spectra using 
the Bruker standard HSQC-based ( hncogpwg3d, hncacogpwg3d, hncacbgpwg3d) experiments both at 30 °C 
and 50°C. When comparing the 1H spectra resulting from the 1st Free Induction Decay (FID) for HNCO and 
HNcaCO and the positive sum of the HNCACB plane we observe significant improvement in the S/N ratio of 
20–30% for HNCO and 50% for HNcaCO and HNCACB when measuring at 50°C (Fig. 2D and Figure S4). This

improvement can be confirmed by the results of an automatic peak detection performed on the respective planes, 
that finds for both HNcaCO and HNCACB planes nearly twice the number of resonances at 50°C compared to 
identical dataset at 30°C. A detailed analysis of the increase of observable peaks is presented in the SI.
To obtain the resonance assignment of LCC ICCG-S165A, we recorded a full HSQC-based HNCACB triple 
resonance spectrum at 50 °C and pH 7.5. Starting from our previous assignment of the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum 
of LCCICCG-S165A at 30°C56 which at the time required nearly 4 weeks of experimental time, we used this single 
spectrum to confirm the assignments at 50°C (Figure S5). A HNCO experiment was recorded to obtain the 13C’ 
resonances at 50°C. In total, 85% of the 1HN/15N resonances along with 91% for 13Cα (234 out of 258), 90% 13Cβ

(215 out of 239 residues, excluding the 19 glycines) and 85% of 13C’ resonances (203 out of 239, excluding all 
residues preceding a proline residue) were assigned.
Raising the temperature for hNcaNNH
In our general effort to accelerate the assignment of the 1H-15N spectrum, we explored the possibility to record 
a hNcaNNH experiment 37. While the common approach of backbone assignment consists of connecting 
consecutive residues through their various 13C resonances, these experiments have been developed to obtain 
sequential correlations between successive amide proton and nitrogen resonances 1H(i−1), 15N(i−1), 1H(i), 15N(i), 
1H(i+1), 15N(i+1)
37,57,58. Although recognized as true game changers in the assignment process for disordered 
proteins59,60, they have not been used for non-deuterated globular proteins of the size of PETases due to their 
inherent low sensitivity. Indeed, the bottleneck in these experiments is the fast 13Ca relaxation rate that significantly 
deteriorates their sensitivity. To explore whether these experiments would profit from the same sensitivity gain 
as the above-described triple resonance spectra with a single period of 13Ca transverse relaxation, we recorded a 
hNcaNNH at 30°C and 50°C with the standard pulse sequence from the Bruker library (hncannhgp3d).
At 30 °C, no signal could be observed (Figure S6), and when raising the temperature to 50 °C the sensitivity 
of this experiment proved at the edge (S/N < 5 for most peaks) in a reasonable amount of experimental time (2 
days 15 hours for a fully sampled dataset) (Fig. 3.A). However, the signal-to-noise ratio further increased by an 
average 70%, and even by a factor of two for certain residues (Figure S7) when raising the temperature to 60°C 
(Fig. 3.A). For many resonances where the connecting peaks were absent in the spectrum at 50°C, we obtained 
at 60°C the connection through their 15N(i−1) and 15N(i+1) resonances. (Fig. 3.B).
Rapid de novo backbone assignment
Based on the quality of the hNcaNNH acquired at 60°C, we sought to investigate whether a de novo backbone 
assignment primarily based on the hNcaNNH and HncaNNH experiments would be possible. Turning stretches 
of connecting resonances into a backbone assignment further required a HNCACB spectrum to obtain amino 
acid type identifying 13C chemical shift values (Fig.  4). Finally, we recorded HNCO and HNcaCO spectra for 
independent verification of the obtained assignments (Table 1). With a 500 µM sample of the active enzyme in a 
5 mm tube, on a 900 MHz spectrometer equipped with a triple-resonance cryogenically cooled probe head, the 
complete data set was acquired within 6 days of machine time (see Methods).
The elevated temperature (60°C) led to improved signal-to-noise data and further allowed efficient non-
uniform sampling providing very high-resolution spectra. Especially for the HncaNNH experiment, this 
enhanced resolution proved important to establish firm 1HN connectivities between resonances of neighboring 
residues and thereby to speed up significantly the assignment procedure. To complement the assignment strategy, 
the HNCACB experiment was employed to confirm the sequential connectivity of residues. This experiment 
enables the identification of both intra-residue (i) and preceding residue (i-1) carbon (Cα and Cβ) resonances, 
thereby establishing the directionality of the assignments.
As the overall goal of our work was to streamline and accelerate the backbone resonance assignment of 
thermostable enzymes, we tested NMRtist, an AI-driven tool that enables automated processing from peak 
picking to resonance assignment and ultimately to structure calculation14. NMRtist requires as input the amino 
acid sequence of the target protein together with peak lists derived from 2D and 3D NMR spectra. Accordingly, 
we prepared peak lists of 1H-15N-HSQC and 3D HNCO, HNcoCA, HNCACB, HncaNNH, and hNcaNNH 
spectra. Automated peak-picking was performed with CCP-NMR v2 software, since NMRtist does not currently

support peak picking for HncaNNH and hNcaNNH spectra. When providing only the carbon-connectivity-
based spectra (HNCO, HNcoCA, HNCACB) along 1H-15N-HSQC peak lists, NMRtist returned an estimated 
chemical shift assignment coverage of 46%. This value increased to 65% upon inclusion of the HncaNNH 
and hNcaNNH peak lists as input. The inclusion of HncaNNH and hNcaNNH peak lists hence significantly 
improves the overall assignment score, despite the fact that these spectra are underrepresented in the training 
data, potentially leading to reduced performance. Therefore, we proceeded simultaneously with a manual 
backbone resonance assignment. Within three days of spectral analysis, and without relying on the previously 
generated NMRtist outputs, we successfully assigned nearly 80% of backbone (1H/15N) resonances (Figure S8). 
A comparison between the manual and NMRtist-derived assignments revealed inaccuracies in the latter which 
are likely attributable to the fact that our PETase, with its 258 amino acids, lies at the upper limit of the protein 
size range for which NMRtist was trained. In addition, the slightly lower percentage than the one obtained 
previously for the inactive LCC ICCG variant is primarily due to additional broadening of some resonances 
assigned to solvent exposed residues that were already at the limit of observation at 50 °C in LCC ICCG-S165A 
(T211 and G127; see Figure S5).
Discussion
The initial steps of the development of new or improved PETases have invariably involved molecular modeling 
and/or bioinformatics, whereby the starting 3D structures that served as input for these efforts mostly came 
from X-ray crystallography. Examples such as TfCut2 (PDB code: 4CG161), Cut190 (5ZNO62), LCC and mutants 
(4EBO32 and 6THS, 6THT34) or IsPETase (5XG063), are reviewed by Liu et al.64 and Tournier et al.23.
Solution biomolecular NMR has only recently entered this field, and not as much as to obtain structural 
information but to characterize the interaction between the enzyme and small soluble substrates 56,65 or to 
investigate the role of the catalytic histidine with its associated pKa value 40. Recently, a solid state NMR study 
of the TfCut2 enzyme embedded in a trehalose glass in the presence of nanoparticles (NPs) made of 13C labeled 
PET oligomers equally added to our understanding of the enzyme/polymer interaction and the biocatalytic 
mechanism of the hydrolase reaction66. However, if NMR wants to consolidate its place in this large-scale project 
that is the development of industrial PETases, easy, rapid and robust methods providing the assignment of the 
1H-15N and/or 1H-13C spectra are required.
Our study demonstrates that recording NMR experiments at elevated temperatures can significantly accelerate 
backbone resonance assignment of thermostable PETases. Using the TRACT approach44,45, we observed that the 
overall global tumbling time was reduced by approximately a factor of two, effectively making a 25 kDa protein 
behave like a ~ 10 kDa protein in the NMR tube. Furthermore, the sensitivity increase that accompanies the 
line narrowing by this apparent molecular weight decrease (Fig. 2) is not counteracted by opposing effects such 
as increased exchange with the water or other line broadening effects. Indeed, we observed very limited amide 
proton exchange up to 50°C/60°C, with only a couple of resonances less intense compared to 30°C. This sharply 
contrasts with the case of IDPs where amide proton signals at neutral to alkaline pH completely disappear at 
higher temperatures67,68. An upfield shift for most of the amide protons is observed at the high temperature, due 
to weakened hydrogen bonding69–71. It is not clear at this moment whether the pH dependence of our Tris buffer

The strips are only displayed in the window corresponding to the HSQC experiment (blue). The resonances 
of V115 and I119 respectively on the V116 and V118 strips are outside of displayed window. The orange line

at higher temperature (with a predicted lowering of 0.3 units between 30°C and 50°C) contributes to this shift  
or to limiting the water exchange. Finally, NOE build-up curves at both temperatures (Figure S2) showed the 
feasibility of recording a high-resolution NOESY-HSQC spectrum even at 50 °C, and could thereby provide the 
experimental data for efforts to assign the 1H-15N HSQC on the sole basis of a 3D NOESY-HSQC experiment 
together with the experimental (or predicted) 3D structure14,72.
Particularly true for enzymes near or beyond 30 kDa, considered the size-limit of classical solution state 
NMR, assignment of the 1H-15N HSQC spectrum remains a real bottleneck for many projects in which NMR is 
or could be involved. Except for intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), where the relevant τc parameter does not 
correlate with the MW of the protein, the size problem leads not only to an increased number of peaks but also to 
peak broadening and hence decreased signal-to-noise. Deuteration73–75 together with TROSY approaches36 can 
alleviate the latter peak broadening, but significantly increases the price per sample, with associated costs that 
become an important factor to consider in a program that generates many variants. Altogether, we observe in 
the Biomagresbank76 an exponentially decreasing number of deposited assignments for proteins larger than 150 
residues, and finally no more than ~ 100 entries for proteins of the size of LCC and its derivatives14.
Although the NMR assignment clearly will never keep up with the many PETase variants that are currently 
tested in academic and industrial laboratories all over the world, speeding up the process could increase its use 
in this rapidly evolving field. Not only do we increase the sensitivity of the standard triple resonance experiments 
that are the cornerstone of the assignment process by matching 13C frequencies (Fig. 2.D), but directly connecting 
consecutive amide peaks through the complementary hNcaNNH or HncaNNH spectra becomes possible (Figs. 
3 and 4) and dramatically speeds up the procedure, be it manual or (semi-)automatic. High temperatures equally 
imply we are studying these enzymes in what we would call ‘near-working industrial conditions” 35 (to make 
the parallel with “near-physiological conditions” for disease related enzymes), and should therefore be seen 
as a win-win situation for solution state NMR : it not only yields higher-quality data and opens the door to 
experiments that would otherwise be impossible, but it also gives information about the enzyme in conditions 
that approximate its real-world functioning.
