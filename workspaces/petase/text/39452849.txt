Abstract: Since the 2005 discovery of the first enzyme capable of depolymerizing polyethylene
terephthalate (PET), an aromatic polyester once thought to be enzymatically inert, extensive research
has been undertaken to identify and engineer new biocatalysts for plastic degradation. This effort
was directed toward developing efficient enzymatic recycling technologies that could overcome the
limitations of mechanical and chemical methods. These enzymes are versatile molecules obtained
from microorganisms living in various environments, including soil, compost, surface seawater, and
extreme habitats such as hot springs, hydrothermal vents, deep-sea regions, and Antarctic seawater.
Among various plastics, PET and polylactic acid (PLA) have been the primary focus of enzymatic
depolymerization research, greatly enhancing our knowledge of enzymes that degrade these specific
polymers. They often display unique catalytic properties that reflect their particular ecological
niches. This review explores recent advancements in marine-derived enzymes that can depolymerize
synthetic plastic polymers, emphasizing their structural and functional features that influence the
efficiency of these catalysts in biorecycling processes. Current status and future perspectives of
enzymatic plastic depolymerization are also discussed, with a focus on the underexplored marine
enzymatic resources.

1. Introduction
Plastics are versatile, durable, and cost-effective materials that have become essential
in various aspects of modern life. Since their widespread adoption in the 1950s, plastics
have revolutionized nearly every sector of the economy, including packaging, construction,
textile, automotive, consumer products, and healthcare [1]. Accordingly, annual plastic pro-
duction continuously increased from 2 million metric tons (Mt) in 1950 to 400.3 Mt in 2022,
surpassing most other materials [2,3]. Seven groups of fossil-based polymers accounted
for three-quarters of global plastic production in 2022, namely polypropylene (PP) with
18.9%, low-density polyethylene (LD-PE) and linear low-density polyethylene (LLD-PE)
with 14.1%, polyvinyl chloride (PVC) with 12.7%, high-density polyethylene (HD-PE) with
12.2%, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) with 6.2%, polyurethane (PUR) with 5.3%, and
polystyrene (PS) with 5.2%. Additionally, other fossil-based plastics constituted 15.9% of
the total share, while bio-based polymers accounted for 0.5% of the production, carbon-
captured plastics represented less than 0.1%, and recycled plastics corresponded to 9%
(8.9% mechanically recycled and less than 0.1% chemically recycled) [3].
The high chemical stability of the macromolecular structure that confers plastics
versatility in a wide range of applications is also responsible for their resistance to abiotic
and biological degradation. Consequently, it is estimated that about 91% of all plastic
ever produced has accumulated in landfills, been incinerated, or been discarded in the
natural environment, while around 9% has been recycled [2,4]. Of the four disposal options,
incineration generally produces the largest amounts of greenhouse gases, thus having a

large impact on climate change [5]. Plastics that end up in landfills or are released into the
environment in an uncontrolled manner can take hundreds or even thousands of years to
degrade [6]. During their slow decomposition, they release microplastics (i.e., particles
smaller than 5 mm) and other toxic compounds, such as heavy metals (e.g., cadmium used
in pigments) [7] and additives (e.g., phthalates), [8] that can affect soil and water quality,
marine and terrestrial wildlife, and potentially human health through the food chain [5].
The long-term environmental pollution caused by plastic waste prompted authorities
to develop international strategies aimed at enhancing recycling processes and reducing
fossil-based plastic production in favor of biodegradable bio-based feedstocks. The Euro-
pean Union, for instance, supports the principles of a circular economy, where plastics are
reused and recycled rather than discarded into landfills or incinerated, thus promoting a
sustainable model by reducing waste, resource use, and greenhouse gas emissions [9,10].
Recycling of fossil-based plastics is primarily done by mechanical and chemical pro-
cesses (Figure 1). Mechanical recycling is the most common method and involves sorting,
grinding, washing, melting, and pelletizing plastic waste. This process allows plastic
waste to be recycled multiple times, albeit with a progressive loss of quality caused by
the thermal-mechanical degradation of polymers during reprocessing [11,12]. Mechanical
recycling is generally used for PET and PE due to their chemical, mechanical, and thermal
properties, which make them suitable for the process. In contrast, temperature-sensitive
plastics and those resistant to flow at high temperatures, such as thermosets, cannot be
recycled this way [13].
Chemical recycling complements mechanical methods by enabling the recycling of
complex, mixed, and contaminated plastics. This method includes processes like pyrolysis,
gasification, solvent-based purification (dissolution), and depolymerization, which convert
plastic waste into simpler molecules (i.e., monomers, oligomers, polymers) that can be used
for various practical purposes, including creating value-added products (i.e., upcycling)
and new plastics with properties equivalent to virgin materials [14–19]. Although chem-
ical methods are superior to mechanical recycling, they require harsh physicochemical
conditions, such as high temperature (>180 ◦C), high pressure (20–40 atm), and chemical
catalysts (e.g., caustic bases, concentrated sulfuric or nitric acids) that result in large energy
requirements and hazardous waste generation. In an attempt to overcome these limitations,
researchers have recently focused their attention on developing recycling strategies based
on enzymatic, photo-, electro-, and microwave-assisted catalysis under environmental
and relatively mild conditions [15,20,21], as well as on finding and genetically engineering
plastic-degrading microorganisms [15,18]. Although these emerging technologies may offer
a more environmentally friendly and energy-efficient alternative to conventional chemical
recycling processes, many are still in the laboratory stage and require further research to
achieve industrial applications [20].
A third method for recycling plastics is biological or organic degradation (Figure 1),
which utilizes microorganisms and their enzymes to decompose biodegradable polymers
into environmentally friendly compounds, such as gases (e.g., carbon dioxide, methane)
and other organic molecules (e.g., monomers, oligomers) that may be used for recycling
and upcycling purposes [9,22]. Biological degradation is a complex process typically in-
volving from two to four stages: ( i) the attachment of microorganisms to the polymer
surface (biofilm formation), (ii) the synthesis of extracellular enzymes that depolymerize
polymeric chains into oligomers and monomers (depolymerization), (iii) the transporta-
tion of these low molecular weight molecules into the cells (assimilation), and ( iv) the
metabolization of these molecules to produce energy, water, and other simple compounds,
such as carbon dioxide and methane [ 23,24]. This method is sustainable and energy ef-
ficient, but it applies to a limited number of polymer types (both bio- and fossil-based),
mainly polylactic acid (PLA), polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), polybutylene succinate (PBS),
polycaprolactone (PCL), polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT), and starch, which
constituted approximately 0.29% of the total amount of plastics produced in 2022 [22].

processes involving enzymes and/or microorganisms are indicated with a red asterisk (*).
While the first reports of microbial strains capable of degrading aliphatic synthetic polyesters,
such as PCL, date back to the 1970s [25,26], the role of enzymes in plastic recycling began to
be recognized in 2005 when Müller and colleagues [27] reported the enzymatic hydrolysis of
PET, an aromatic polyester regarded as enzymatically inert at that time. Since then, research on
enzymatic catalysis of plastic has increased sharply [28], and the resulting high influx of data has
necessitated the creation of databases (e.g., PlasticDB [29] and P AZy [30]) to compile and utilize the
extensive information effectively . For instance, as of June 2024, the database PlasticDB [31] lists 753
species of microorganisms and 219 enzymes that break down plastics. PET and PLA have been
the focus of most enzymatic depolymerization studies, and, thus, the largest fraction of plastic-
degrading enzymes characterized to date are specific to these two polymers. Moreover, based on
the knowledge accumulated over the past two decades, the French company Carbios has brought
to maturity a technology for enzymatic depolymerization and recycling of PET, culminating in the
Mar. Drugs 2024, 22, 441 4 of 32
announcement that an industrial plant utilizing this technology will be constructed by 2025 [4,32].
Nevertheless, the enzymatic degradation of recalcitrant polymers, such as PE, PP , PVC, PS, and
PUR, has achieved only limited success, and much more research is necessary to identify efficient
biocatalysts against plastics with high chemical stability [4].
Plastic-degrading enzymes, also known as plastic hydrolases or depolymerases, typi-
cally break down synthetic polymers into their monomers or oligomers through hydrolysis.
These enzymes are categorized into several types based on their substrate specificity and
reaction mechanism. The main types include cutinases (EC 3.1.1.74), which degrade cutin
(the polyester structural component of the plant cuticle) as well as synthetic polyesters; car-
boxylesterases (EC 3.1.1.1), which act on ester bonds in various polyesters; triacylglycerol
lipases (EC 3.1.1.3), which break down triglycerides but also exhibit activity against certain
plastics; and PET hydrolases (EC 3.1.1.101), specifically targeting PET polymers [4]. Most
of these enzymes originate from prokaryotic microorganisms, particularly thermophilic
sources, due to the need for most plastics to be efficiently degraded at high tempera-
tures (>65 ◦C), close to their glass transition temperatures [ 33]. Some notable examples
of thermostable cutinases active on PET have been derived from actinomycetes species,
such as Thermobifida (e.g., TfH/BTA-1 [27]), Thermomonospora (e.g., Tcur0390 [34]), and
Saccharomonospora (e.g., Cut190 [35]), as well as from plant compost metagenomes (e.g.,
LC-cutinase/LCC [36] and PHL7 [ 37]). Several heat-labile plastic-degrading enzymes
derived from mesophilic and cold-adapted microorganisms, such as IsPETase isolated from
Ideonella sakaiensis [38] and OaCut from Oleispira antarctica [39], have also been reported in
the literature, serving as a base for protein engineering studies aimed at enhancing their
thermal stability [40].
The environments from which plastic-degrading enzymes have been obtained are
diverse, including soil [ 38,41], compost [ 36], surface seawater [ 42], and habitats with
extreme physicochemical conditions, such as hot springs [43], hydrothermal vents [44,45],
deep-sea [45], and Antarctic seawater [39]. This high diversity of environments in which
plastic-degrading microorganisms can survive is correlated with the adaptation of their
enzymes to function in a wide range of physicochemical conditions, including extreme
temperature, pH, salinity, and pressure. In this regard, enzymes derived from marine
microorganisms, particularly those inhabiting extreme habitats, may present extreme
features, such as high thermostability, activity under acidic pH, and resistance to salts and
pressure, which can be advantageous in industrial plastic-recycling processes [4,21].
Several excellent reviews have been published that comprehensively discuss the recent
advances in enzyme-based depolymerization of plastics [4,21,46,47], with some focusing
on marine [ 48] and extremophilic microorganisms [ 49]. To the best of our knowledge,
no recent study has reviewed plastic-degrading enzymes from marine environments,
albeit Lv and colleagues [48] concentrated more on marine microorganisms and metabolic
pathways involved in plastic degradation rather than on the structural and functional
characteristics of their enzymes. Considering the recently registered progress in this area,
the present work aims to review the latest advancements in marine-derived enzymes
capable of depolymerizing synthetic plastic polymers. This review highlights the unique
characteristics of these enzymes that potentially make them advantageous in the harsh
conditions of industrial plastic-recycling processes, as well as their current limitations.
2. Polyethylene Terephthalate (PET) Depolymerization
2.1. About PET and Its Recycling Strategies
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a semiaromatic and semicrystalline polyester con-
sisting of repeating units of terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG). Characterized
by high mechanical strength, gas and liquid impermeability, high optical clarity, and low
weight, PET is primarily used to produce textile fibers, single-use bottles, and rigid contain-
ers. Generally, TPA and EG are made from petroleum resources, although bio-based PET
synthesis is possible by combining biomass-derived EG and fossil-based TPA [4].
Mar. Drugs 2024, 22, 441 5 of 32
Due to its wide utilization in short-life products, PET is the most commonly recycled
plastic globally, primarily through mechanical processing [4]. However, major drawbacks
are associated with mechanical recycling, namely, (i) only transparent and pure PET waste
can be used to produce bottles; (ii) PET ductility decreases significantly after the first cycle
of recycling, mainly due to the thermo-mechanical and thermo-oxidative degradation of
polymers, necessitating the use of recycled PET for lower-value products, such as fibers in
carpeting, which cannot be recycled further; and (iii) contaminants, such as traces of PLA
and PVC, adversely impact the quality of recycled PET [50].
A less exploited recycling strategy involves the chemical depolymerization of PET
chains into their highly thermostable original monomers (i.e., TPA and EG) or intermediate
oligomers, such as bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) and mono(2-hydroxyethyl)
terephthalate (MHET) (Figure 2), which can be reprocessed into new products with char-
acteristics similar to virgin materials. The various depolymerization processes developed
to date utilize different reagents and reaction conditions (e.g., alcoholysis, nitrogen-based
solvolysis, glycolysis, and alkaline, acidic, neutral, or enzymatic hydrolysis), each with its
advantages and drawbacks [51–53]. Enzyme-based PET depolymerization emerged as a
promising alternative among the various chemical recycling methods. This is primarily due
to (i) the milder temperatures required for enzymatic depolymerization, which results in
less energy consumption; (ii) the unnecessity of using hazardous chemicals such as highly
polar solvents and concentrated acids; and (iii) the high selectivity of enzymes for polymer
ester bonds facilitates monomers recovery and allows the process to apply to blended
materials, avoiding intensive plastic sorting [4,54,55].

are associated with mechanical recycling, namely, (i) only transparent and pure PET waste 
can be used to produce bottles; (ii) PET ductility decreases signiﬁcantly after the ﬁrst cycle 
of recycling, mainly due to the thermo-mechanical and thermo-oxidative degradation of 
polymers, necessitating the use of recycled PET for lower-value products, such as ﬁbers

PLA and PVC, adversely impact the quality of recycled PET [50]. 
A less exploited recycling strategy involves the chemical depolymerization of PET 
chains into their highly thermostable original monomers (i.e., TPA and EG) or intermedi-
ate oligomers, such as bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) and mono(2-hydroxy-
ethyl) terephthalate (MHET) (Figure 2), which can be reprocessed into new products with 
characteristics similar to virgin materials. The various depolymerization processes devel-
oped to date utilize diﬀerent reagents and reaction conditions (e.g., alcoholysis, nitrogen-
based solvolysis, glycolysis, and alkaline, acidic, neutral, or enzymatic hydrolysis), each 
with  its  advantages  and  drawbacks  [51–53].  Enzyme-based  PET  depolymerization 
emerged as a promising alternative among the various chemical recycling methods. This 
is primarily due to (i) the milder temperatures required for enzymatic depolymerization, 
which results in less energy consumption; (ii) the unnecessity of using hazardous chemi-
cals such as highly polar solvents and concentrated acids; and (iii) the high selectivity of 
enzymes for polymer ester bonds facilitates monomers recovery and allows the process to 
apply to blended materials, avoiding intensive plastic sorting [4,54,55].

However, PET enzymatic depolymerization is not an easy task, facing major challenges
primarily due to the polyester’s macromolecular architecture (e.g., crystallinity and surface
hydrophobicity), which restricts enzyme binding, and, secondarily, due to the limitations
of the biocatalysts (e.g., thermolability, low catalytic efficiency, and enzyme inhibition).
Polymer crystallinity is among the key factors affecting PET depolymerization [ 56]. As
a semicrystalline polymer, PET is characterized by regularly arranged, tightly packed
regions (crystalline) and nonorganized, less cohesive regions (amorphous). The amorphous
regions comprise fractions that are mobile at temperatures above the PET’s glass transition
temperature (i.e., 70–80 ◦C) and fractions that maintain rigidity, connecting crystalline
regions with mobile amorphous domains (Figure 2) [4,57]. Although some studies have
claimed that semicrystalline PET polymers (i.e., 30–40% crystallinity) are susceptible to en-
zymatic depolymerization [38,58], several recent reports have unequivocally demonstrated
that only amorphous PET, particularly the mobile regions, can be subjected to enzyme
attack [32,40,59]. Consequently, until novel enzymes capable of acting on semicrystalline
polymers are discovered or engineered, the current technology relies on PET pretreatments
through various physical (e.g., extrusion [32]) or chemical (e.g., solubilization by organic
solvents [60]) methods to increase its amorphous fraction (amorphization). Subsequently,
this step is followed by enzymatic depolymerization at temperatures near the PET’s glass
transition temperature, at which chains are mobile, favoring enzyme binding. It is thus
mandatory that PET hydrolases exhibit high thermostability above 65 ◦C [4,32,56].
Extensive efforts have been made in recent years to discover and characterize PET-
active enzymes, as well as to engineer their structure to increase thermostability, improve
their interaction with the substrate, optimize catalytic activity, and minimize their inhibition
by degradation intermediates [4,21]. However, there remains room for improvement, and
bioprospecting studies to discover more efficient biocatalysts from various environments
are still of particular interest, as genes encoding these enzymes are spread across numerous
bacterial and fungal branches [61]. The next section will focus on PET hydrolases derived
from marine environments and their potential utility in PET recycling.
2.2. PET-Depolymerizing Marine Enzymes
Numerous PET-depolymerizing enzymes (hereafter also referred to as PET hydrolases,
without specific reference to the EC class 3.1.1.101) from various bacterial and fungal sources
have been discovered and characterized, as detailed in several recent reviews [4,21,46,47].
Of the 110 PET-degrading hydrolases listed in the PAZy database [62] as of June 2024, 15
(excepting engineered variants) originate from marine sources, either cultured microorgan-
isms or environmental metagenomic datasets (Table 1). As discussed further in this section,
most of these enzymes belong to a subclass of the α/β-hydrolase enzyme superfamily,
characterized by a highly conserved core domain comprising an eight- or nine-stranded
β-sheet surrounded by six to eight α-helices. Notably, two enzymes, Rcut and PET46,
exhibit significantly different structural properties. Nevertheless, despite their differences
in amino acid sequence and three-dimensional conformation, all PET hydrolases share a
common catalytic machinery with a highly conserved catalytic triad (Ser, His, Asp), which
performs the ester bond hydrolysis through a nucleophilic attack by the catalytic serine’s
oxygen on the carbonyl carbon atom present in the scissile ester bond [4].

PET hydrolases have been classified into two main types, type I and type II, with type
II further divided into subtypes IIa and IIb. This classification is based on comparisons to
the primary structure of IsPETase, a type IIb enzyme derived from Ideonella sakaiensis [74].
Among the 15 PET-degrading enzymes of marine origin, eight are classified as type IIa and
two as type I. The remaining five enzymes are unclassified due to significant divergence
in their amino acid sequences compared to the type I and type II enzymes (Figure 3).
Taxonomically, these enzymes are distributed across various phyla: ten are associated with
Pseudomonadota, three with Actinomycetes, one with Bacteroidota, and one with the
archaeal phylum Bathyarchaeota (Table 1 and Figure 3).

Since most of the marine-derived PET hydrolases originate from cold habitats, such as
Antarctic seawater and deep-sea sediments, they were found to be adapted to function optimally
at relatively low temperatures (i.e., 25–50◦C), featuring melting temperatures (Tm) between 40
and 50 ◦C. The only notable exception is PET46, which was derived from sediments near a
hydrothermal vent and exhibited activity and stability at high temperatures. Generally , these
enzymes performed optimally at a slightly alkaline pH (7.4–9.0), and some (i.e., PET6 and SM14est)
were remarkably tolerant to high salt concentrations (T able 1).
Accurately comparing the enzymes’ efficacy in PET depolymerization, based on
the total amount of hydrolysis products released from PET, was hindered by the use of
substantially different substrates. Nonetheless, three wild-type enzymes (PET46, Ple629,
and PET6) and three chimeric variants (CMA266C, PET6-VSTA, and PET6-ExLoop) produced
over 1 mM of hydrolysis products (Table 1), highlighting their potential for large-scale
recycling applications. A detailed review of each marine-derived enzyme listed in Table 1
is provided below.
An extensive screening of protein databases and metagenomic datasets using a Hid-
den Markov Model (HMM) approach has led to the identification of 853 putative PET
hydrolases, including the marine microorganism-derived enzymes PET5 and PET6 [41].
Since these enzymes produced clearing halos on agar plates containing PET nanoparticles
or PCL after their cloning and heterologous expression in Escherichia coli [41], they were
chosen for further biochemical characterization [39,64].
PET5, also known as OaCut [39], was derived from the genome of Oleispira antarctica
RB-8, a psychrophilic hydrocarbonoclastic bacterium isolated from the superficial seawater
of Rod Bay, Antarctica [ 76]. Computational analysis of the sequence and structure of
OaCut revealed common features with other type IIa PET hydrolases [ 74], namely, two
disulfide bridges between Cys220-Cys257 and Cys291-Cys308, a Phe256 residue at the
corresponding position of Ser238 in IsPETase, and an extended loop with three extra amino
acids (Gly-Ser-Ile) between position 262 and 264 [39]. The presence of two disulfide bridges
is generally associated with enhanced thermal stability in enzymes [74]. However, OaCut
exhibited lower stability at elevated temperatures compared to type I PET hydrolases,
which possess only one disulfide bond. This observation suggested that the high thermal
stability of type I PET hydrolases is attributed to structural features other than disulfide
bonding [74]. Moreover, the melting temperature (Tm) of OaCut was 40.4 ◦C, reflecting its
moderate thermal stability typical of enzymes derived from psychrophilic microorganisms.
By assaying the ability of OaCut to hydrolyze amorphous PET films at 25 ◦C, a modest
weight loss of 0.4% was observed after 6 days. This efficiency is five times lower than that
of Mors1, which was tested under the same conditions (Table 1) [39].
PET6 was identified by screening the genome of Vibrio gazogenes DSM-21264, a marine
bacterium isolated from sulfide-containing mud collected from a saltwater marsh [41,77].
The crystal structure of PET6, resolved at 1.4 Å resolution, revealed an α/β-hydrolase fold
characterized by eight β-strands surrounded by α-helices and a conserved catalytic triad
(Ser163, Asp209, and His241) (Figure 4). It shared common features with other type IIa PET
hydrolases, as detailed above for PET5, but with the major difference that PET6 exhibited
the formation of a third disulfide bridge near the N-terminus, a rare trait among PET
hydrolases [64]. This additional disulfide bond was also observed in Mors1 [63] and was
suggested to be an adaptation to low temperatures [39]. Moreover, the ability of PET6 to
bind three monovalent ions (two sodium ions and a chloride ion) instead of divalent ions, as
in the case of many PET hydrolases, was considered an adaptation to saline environments
with high sodium chloride concentrations [64].
The purified heterologous PET6 enzyme was shown to optimally hydrolyze post-
consumer PET (around 10% crystallinity) at 45–50 ◦C in the presence of 1–1.5 M NaCl.
Increasing salt concentrations from 50 mM to 1.5 M promoted catalytic activity by stabilizing
the proteins, as the Tm increased from 49.8 ◦C at 50 mM NaCl to 57.7 ◦C in the presence
of 1 M NaCl. Under optimal conditions, the hydrolysis products, including TPA, BHET,
and MHET, had a summed concentration of approximately 1.1 mM (Table 1). This is
Mar. Drugs 2024, 22, 441 10 of 32
comparable to the concentration produced by the chimeric Mors1 variant (CMA266C) under
a similar reaction temperature and pH [63]. However, this comparison may not be entirely
appropriate, as the PET substrates used in the two studies differed.

water of Rod Bay, Antarctica [76]. Computational analysis of the sequence and structure 
of OaCut revealed common features with other type IIa PET hydrolases [74], namely, two

PET6 was identiﬁed by screening the genome of Vibrio gazogenes DSM-21264, a ma-
rine bacterium isolated from sulﬁde-containing mud collected from a saltwater marsh

Three PET6 variants, namely , PET6-YLA, PET6-ExLoop, and PET6-VSTA, were created
by introducing mutations into the wild-type protein sequence inspired by the structure of
IsPETase [64]. Specifically , in the PET6-YLA variant, the tyrosine residue at position 248 was
replaced by an alanine (mutation Y248A). The PET6-ExLoop variant involved replacing the entire
extended loop composed of TGYPSE residues between positions 246–251 with the SGNSNQ
sequence fromIsPETase. In the PET6-VSTA variant, two mutations were introduced: valine
at position 91 was replaced with threonine (mutation V91T), and serine at position 92 was
replaced with alanine (mutation S92A). Of the three variants, PET6-ExLoop and PET6-VSTA
outperformed the wild-type PET6 by 79% and 58%, respectively , at 50◦C and 1 M NaCl
(T able 1). Under these reaction conditions, PET6-VSTA demonstrated a 1.6-fold higher release of
hydrolysis products from PET substrate compared toIsPET ase. However, this performance was
approximately three times lower than that ofIsPETase at 30◦C and 1 M NaCl [64].
Mors1 was identified in the genome of Moraxella sp. TA144, a psychrophilic bac-
terium isolated from Antarctic seawater [78], through a BLAST search of the UniProtKB
database using the amino acid sequence of IsPETase as a query [39]. This search, which
revealed a 45% sequence identity with IsPETase, was followed by the cloning and expres-
sion of the enzyme-coding gene in E. coli. The purified enzyme completely clarified a
PCL nanoparticle suspension at an optimal temperature of 25 ◦C, with its preference for
moderate temperatures also highlighted by its relatively low Tm of 52 ◦C. Moreover, the
enzymatic activity was optimal at an alkaline pH of 8.0 and was enhanced by 20% by
adding 200 mM NaCl to the reaction buffer. The promoting effect of salts on enzymatic
activity has also been reported in other PET hydrolases, such as IsPETase [79], PET6 [64],
and SM14est [71], and can be attributed to the formation of coordinated bonds between
certain enzyme amino acids and Cl − anion, which stabilizes the catalytic center of the
enzyme [79]. By assaying the ability of Mors1 to hydrolyze amorphous PET films at 25 ◦C,
Mar. Drugs 2024, 22, 441 11 of 32
a weight loss of 1.98% and 2.5% was observed after 6 days and 10 days, respectively. The
hydrolysis products released after 24 h, represented by MHET and TPA, had a summed
concentration of about 0.26 mM, similar to that produced by IsPETase under the same
conditions; however, the concentration of Mors1 used was four times higher than that of
IsPETase (Table 1) [39]. The crystal structure of Mors1 (Figure 4), which was solved at
1.6 Å resolution, revealed high similarities with other PET hydrolases [ 63]. Specifically,
it showed a canonical α/β-hydrolase fold comprised of a central β-sheet of nine strands
surrounded by six α-helices, a conserved Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad, and a binding subsite
II almost identical to that of other type IIa PET hydrolases. More notable differences were
observed in subsite I, where two conserved residues were replaced in Mors1 by Tyr214
and Asp153, and in the N-terminal region, where a third disulfide bond was confirmed
between residues Cys60 and Cys109 [63]. This third disulfide bridge was also reported in
PET6 [64] and could represent a stabilization strategy of cold-adapted microorganisms to
counterbalance the flexibility of their enzymes [39].
Two engineered variants of Mors1, termed CM and CM A266C, have been obtained
by substituting the 15-residue region that comprises the highly flexible active site loop in
Mors1 with a homologous 13-residue region from the highly efficient and thermostable
LCC [63]. The chimeric variant CM lost the active site disulfide bridge (Cys231-Cys266)
due to the absence of cysteine residues in the homologous loop of LCC, resulting in a
complete loss of enzymatic activity. In contrast, the CMA266C chimera, which had its active
site disulfide bridge restored by replacing alanine with cysteine at position 266, exhibited a
shift in optimal activity temperature from 25 ◦C to 45 ◦C and a fivefold increase in catalytic
activity against amorphous PET films at 45 ◦C compared with wild-type Mors1 activity at
25 ◦C (Table 1) [63]. Although CMA266C exhibited significant improvements over Mors1, its
activity is still 30–40 times lower than that of thermophilic PET hydrolases LCC and PHL7,
which were reported to achieve 73% and 100% weight loss of amorphous PET films within
24 h of reaction at 70 ◦C [37].
The Ple628 and Ple629 encoding genes were recovered from the metagenome of
a marine microbial consortium capable of utilizing a commercial PBAT-blend film as
the sole carbon source [ 66]. These two tandem genes clustered phylogenetically with
cutinase-encoding genes fromMarinobacter species and shared over 50% sequence similarity
with IsPETase [66]. Considering their putative plastic-degrading capabilities, they were
subsequently cloned and expressed in E. coli, purified, and structurally and functionally
characterized [65]. The sequences and crystal structures of Ple628 and Ple629 enzymes
revealed high similarity to other type IIa PET hydrolases. They were characterized by a
central twisted β-sheet composed of nine β-strands surrounded by eight α-helices. The
catalytic triad Ser-Asp-His, conserved among all PET hydrolases, was also identified in both
enzymes at positions 174/179-220/225-252/257 (positions in Ple628/Ple629, respectively).
Moreover, two disulfide bridges were observed in each enzyme: Cys217-Cys254 and
Cys288-Cys305 in Ple628 and Cys222-Cys259 and Cys297-Cys314 in Ple629. The presence
of two disulfide bonds, a common trait of type IIa PET hydrolases of mesophilic and
psychrophilic origin, and the relatively low Tm (Table 1), suggested that Ple628 and Ple629
are adapted to moderate temperatures. Indeed, the optimal activity of both enzymes
was determined at 30 ◦C, and they retained over 58% of their maximal activity at 20 ◦C.
However, at 40 ◦C, the activity of Ple628 and Ple629 dropped to 31% and 15% of that
detected at 30 ◦C, respectively. When assaying the ability of these enzymes to hydrolyze
PET nanoparticles of unspecified crystallinity at 30 ◦C, Ple629 released a 24-fold higher
amount of MHET and TPA compared to Ple628 (Table 1) [65]. This level of product release
is comparable to the concentrations produced by CMA266C, PET6-VSTA, and PET46, albeit
under higher reaction temperatures (i.e., 45 ◦C, 50 ◦C, and 60 ◦C, respectively) and different
PET substrates (Table 1).
PpelaLip was identified through a homology-guided sequence search of various extracellu-
lar hydrolases fromPseudomonassp., using the amino acid sequence ofThermobifida cellulosilytica
cutinase (Thc_Cut1) as a template [67]. The gene encoding PpelaLip was discovered in the
Mar. Drugs 2024, 22, 441 12 of 32
genome ofHalopseudomonas pelagiaDSM-25163 (formerlyPseudomonas) [67], a psychrotrophic
strain isolated from a culture of the Antarctic green algaPyramimonas gelidicola[80]. Despite
sharing only 12% sequence similarity with Thc_Cut1 (an enzyme known to efficiently hydrolyze
various polyesters), the recombinantly produced and purified PpelaLip was able to degrade an
amorphous, laboratory-synthesized PET-type polyester at 28◦C. The amount of released hy-
drolysis products (~17µM TP A) was comparable to that produced by PE-H (20µM MHET) but
substantially lower than that of other marine-derived PET hydrolases, such as Ple629 (1500µM
TPA and MHET) and PET27 (872µM TPA), that operated under similar reaction temperatures
and pH, albeit on different PET substrates (Table 1). While PpelaLip has also been shown to
hydrolyze polyoxyethylene terephthalate (PET-PEO) under realistic wastewater treatment plant
conditions [81], a more comprehensive structural and functional characterization of this enzyme
is currently lacking.
The gene encoding PE-H was identified in the genome of Halopseudomonas aestusnigri
VGXO14T (formerly Pseudomonas) [82], a marine hydrocarbonoclastic bacterium isolated
from crude oil-contaminated intertidal sand [ 83]. This strain demonstrated the ability
to hydrolyze various polyesters [ 84], prompting further investigation of its enzymatic
capabilities. Consequently, the PE-H gene was cloned and expressed in E. coli, and the
recombinant protein was purified and characterized both structurally and functionally.
Notably, PE-H became the first type IIa PET hydrolase for which the crystal structure
was solved [68]. The enzyme structure at 1.09 Å resolution showed a canonical α/β-fold
with a central twisted β-sheet composed of nine β-strands surrounded by seven α-helices
(Figure 5A). As with all type IIa PET hydrolases, PE-H showed a conserved catalytic triad
(Ser171, Asp217, His249), two disulfide bonds (Cys214-Cys251 and Cys285-Cys302) for
improved stability of the active site, and an extended loop region (Gly254, Gly255, Ser256)
to facilitate interaction with the substrate. These structural features, along with the Tm of
51 ◦C, suggested that PE-H is adapted to moderate temperatures. Indeed, this enzyme
has been shown to partially degrade an amorphous PET film at 30 ◦C (Table 1) but lacked
activity on a more crystalline PET film from a commercial PET bottle. The sole hydrolysis
product released was MHET, at a concentration of about 20 µM [68]. In comparison, other
marine PET hydrolases that operated under similar reaction conditions, such as Ple629 and
PET27, produced 1500 µM and 872 µM hydrolysis products, respectively (Table 1).
In an attempt to improve the activity of PE-H, a series of single and multiple amino
acid substitutions were introduced into its sequence through site-directed mutagenesis
inspired by the structure of IsPETase [68]. Out of the 12 mutants generated, only one
variant (PE-HY250S) exhibited enhanced activity. This variant was obtained by replacing
the aromatic tyrosine residue at position 250, located adjacent to the histidine residue of
the catalytic triad, with a smaller serine residue (mutation Y250S). The structural analysis
of this variant revealed a rearrangement of the loop connecting β3-α2, resulting in an
active site cleft much deeper compared with that of the wild-type PE-H (Figure 5B). This
additional space created a more accessible active site, increasing the amount of MHET
released from an amorphous PET film by 1.3-fold compared to the wild-type enzyme.
Moreover, PE-HY250S displayed modest activity on semicrystalline PET film derived from a
commercial PET bottle (Table 1) [68].
Another study by Erickson and collaborators [43] combined an HMM approach with
machine learning to mine protein databases and metagenomic datasets for novel PET
hydrolases and to predict the optimal temperature of the identified enzymes based on
their sequence. From this analysis, the researchers selected 74 putative thermotolerant PET
hydrolases for heterologous expression inE. coli, followed by purification and experimental
screening. Of these, four enzymes, designated 403, 409, 412, and 606, were derived from
marine sources. The genes encoding enzymes 403 and 409 were identified in a metage-
nomic dataset derived from seawater collected at a depth of 700 m in the Pacific Ocean
and were putatively assigned to Ketobacter species. The gene encoding enzyme 412 was
discovered in the genome of Ketobacter alkanivorans GI5T, a bacterial strain isolated from
surface seawater in Garorim Bay, Republic of Korea [85]. The gene encoding enzyme 606
Mar. Drugs 2024, 22, 441 13 of 32
was identified in the genome of Marinactinospora thermotolerans DSM-45154, a moderately
thermotolerant actinomycete isolated from deep-sea sediment collected at a depth of 3865
m in the northern South China Sea [86]. The purified recombinant enzymes 403, 409, 412,
and 606 demonstrated partial hydrolysis of amorphous PET film at 60–70 ◦C, releasing the
aromatic products BHET, MHET, and TPA at total concentrations of 9, 50, 11, and 345µM,
respectively (Table 1). However, these product yields were substantially lower than that
of the thermophilic cutinase LCC, which produced over 27 mM of hydrolysis products
under similar reaction conditions [43]. Of the four proteins, the crystal structure was only
determined for enzyme 606. It exhibited an α/β-fold, featuring a highly conserved core do-
main with a 9-stranded β-sheet flanked by 8 α-helices. The structure revealed a conserved
catalytic triad (Ser130-Asp176-His208) and a unique C-terminal disulfide bridge (Cys241-
Cys259), while lacking the extended loop characteristic of type II PET hydrolases [ 43].
Based on these structural features, enzyme 606 can be classified as a type I PET hydrolase, a
group that typically includes highly thermostable hydrolases with Tm above 70 ◦C, such as
LCC and PHL7 [37]. Despite this classification, enzyme 606 exhibited a Tm of 53.9 ◦C [43],
similar to other type II marine-derived enzymes, such as Mors1, PET6, and PE-H (Table 1),
suggesting that it performs optimally at moderate temperatures rather than at temperatures
near to the polymer glass transition temperature.

The gene encoding PE-H was identiﬁed in the genome of Halopseudomonas aestusnigri 
VGXO14T (formerly Pseudomonas) [82], a marine hydrocarbonoclastic bacterium isolated 
from crude oil-contaminated intertidal sand [83]. This strain demonstrated the ability to 
hydrolyze various polyesters [84], prompting further investigation of its enzymatic capa-
bilities. Consequently, the PE-H gene was cloned and expressed in E. coli, and the recom-
binant protein was puriﬁed and characterized both structurally and functionally. Notably, 
PE-H became the ﬁrst type IIa PET hydrolase for which the crystal structure was solved 
[68]. The enzyme structure at 1.09 Å resolution showed a canonical α/β-fold with a central 
twisted β-sheet composed of nine β-strands surrounded by seven α-helices (Figure 5A). 
As with all type IIa PET hydrolases, PE-H showed a conserved catalytic triad (Ser171, 
Asp217, His249), two disulﬁde bonds (Cys214-Cys251 and Cys285-Cys302) for improved 
stability of the active site, and an extended loop region (Gly254, Gly255, Ser256) to facili-
tate interaction with the substrate. These structural features, along with the Tm of 51 °C, 
suggested that PE-H is adapted to moderate temperatures. Indeed, this enzyme has been 
shown to partially degrade an amorphous PET ﬁlm at 30 °C (Table 1) but lacked activity 
on a more crystalline PET ﬁlm from a commercial PET bottle. The sole hydrolysis product 
released was MHET, at a concentration of about 20 µM [68]. In comparison, other marine 
PET hydrolases that operated under similar reaction conditions, such as Ple629 and 
PET27, produced 1500 µM and 872 µM hydrolysis products, respectively (Table 1). 
In an attempt to improve the activity of PE-H, a series of single and multiple amino 
acid substitutions were introduced into its sequence through site-directed mutagenesis 
inspired by the structure of IsPETase [68]. Out of the 12 mutants generated, only one var-
iant (PE-HY250S) exhibited enhanced activity. This variant was obtained by replacing the 
aromatic tyrosine residue at position 250, located adjacent to the histidine residue of the 
catalytic triad, with a smaller serine residue (mutation Y250S). The structural analysis of 
this variant revealed a rearrangement of the loop connecting β3-α2, resulting in an active 
site cleft much deeper compared with that of the wild-type PE-H (Figure 5B). This addi-
tional space created a more accessible active site, increasing the amount of MHET released 
from an amorphous PET ﬁlm by 1.3-fold compared to the wild-type enzyme. Moreover, 
PE-HY250S displayed modest activity on semicrystalline PET ﬁlm derived from a commer-
cial PET bottle (Table 1) [68].

Eight months before the publication of Erickson et al.’s study [ 43], Liu and col-
leagues [69] reported the identification and characterization of MtCut, a PET hydrolase
encoded in the genome of Marinactinospora thermotolerans DSM-45154. This enzyme (Gen-
bank accession no: SJZ42839.1) has an identical predicted amino acid sequence to the
enzyme later designated as 606 (Genbank accession no: WP_078759821.1) in Erickson
et al.’s study [43], although they did not explicitly reference the earlier work on MtCut. The
purified heterologous MtCut exhibited optimal hydrolytic activity against PET micropar-
Mar. Drugs 2024, 22, 441 14 of 32
ticles (42% crystallinity) at 45 ◦C, pH 8–8.5, and in the presence of Ca2+ at a 10–100 mM
CaCl2 concentration. Under these conditions, the total amount of released TPA, MHET,
and BHET was approximately 400 µM (Table 1). Notably, this enzyme performed better
on 42%-crystallinity PET microparticles than on 10%-crystallinity PET films, as also re-
ported for enzyme 606 [ 43]. This may be due to the enzyme’s active site cleft, enabling
the polymer to adopt low-energy conformations in regions where monomers show a more
linear arrangement, as in the case of high-crystallinity PET [43]. Moreover, MtCut activity
and thermostability were enhanced by Ca 2+, as evidenced by the T m shift from 33 ◦C
without calcium to 41.5 ◦C at 300 mM CaCl2. This feature was also reported for Cut190,
a thermophilic microorganism-derived PET hydrolase whose tertiary structure slightly
changed in the presence of calcium ions [87]. Another notable characteristic of MtCut is
that it was not inhibited by released MHET, unlike other well-characterized PET hydrolases,
such as IsPETase and ICCG (an LCC variant with improved activity and thermostability).
This lack of inhibition may be due to MtCut’s ability to rapidly degrade MHET [69].
The Rcut encoding gene was identified in the genome of Rhodococcus sp. RosL12, a
marine bacterial strain isolated from the Ross Sea, Antarctica [70]. Computational analysis
of the amino acid sequence and predicted three-dimensional structure of Rcut revealed
higher similarity to fungal enzymes than to bacterial ones (Figure 3). The structure exhibited
an α/β-fold with a five-stranded β-sheet surrounded by four α-helices. It also featured a
conserved catalytic triad (Ser114-Asp181-His194) and two disulfide bonds positioned at
both termini of the protein (Cys32-Cys103 and Cys177-Cys184) [70]. Consequently, when
compared to the other marine-derived PET hydrolases detailed in the present review, Rcut
belongs to a different subclass of the α/β-hydrolase fold enzyme superfamily, the same
subclass in which fungal PET hydrolases are classified [ 4]. The purified heterologous
enzyme decomposed a PCL film at an optimal temperature of 40 ◦C and pH 9.0. However,
only traces of TPA and MHET were released from PET film [ 70], suggesting that Rcut
functions more as a PET surface-modifying enzyme rather than a true PET hydrolase [4].
The SM14est encoding gene was identified in the genome of Streptomyces sp. SM14,
a bacterial strain isolated from the marine sponge Haliclona simulans [88]. Computational
analysis of the amino acid sequence and predicted three-dimensional structure of SM14est
revealed a higher level of similarity to thermophilic microorganisms-derived type I PET
hydrolases than to marine-derived type II enzymes [71]. Specifically, SM14est showed 46%
sequence identity and 79.4% similarity with PHL7, a type I PET hydrolase derived from
plant compost [37]. In contrast, it showed 34.4%/75.8%, 33.6%/73.6%, and 32.2%/72.8%
sequence identity/similarity with the marine-derived type II enzymes PET6, PE-H, and
Ple629, respectively [71]. The predicted three-dimensional structure of SM14est exhibited
an α/β-fold with a nine-stranded β-sheet surrounded by seven α-helices. The catalytic
triad found in all PET hydrolases was also conserved in SM14est (Ser156, Asp202, His234).
Consistent with other type I PET hydrolases, SM14est lacked the three extra amino acids of
the loop connecting β8 and α6, which is thought to facilitate enzyme interaction with the
polymer chain. However, the major structural difference between SM14est and other PET
hydrolases was that SM14est lacked any disulfide bridges, whereas other PET hydrolases
have been shown to possess from one to three such structures [ 88]. Despite lacking any
disulfide bonds, SM14est exhibited the highest Tm (55 ◦C) [71] among the wild-type PET-
depolymerizing enzymes derived from marine bacteria (Table 1). However, its T m was
still considerably lower than that of thermostable type I PET hydrolases, such as LCC and
PHL7, whose Tm values exceed 79 ◦C [37].
The SM14est encoding gene was cloned and expressed in Bacillus subtilis, and the puri-
fied enzyme was assayed on semicrystalline PET powder with over 40% crystallinity [71].
Consistent with its Tm, SM14est exhibited optimal activity at 45 ◦C, producing TPA, MHET,
and BHET at a total concentration of 270 µM (Table 1). This amount of released products
was lower than that reported for MtCut (400 µM) under similar reaction conditions. How-
ever, MtCut required a longer incubation time (Table 1), which suggests a potentially higher
turnover rate for SM14est. Moreover, the enzymatic activity of SM14est was significantly
Mar. Drugs 2024, 22, 441 15 of 32
influenced by salts, showing a 5-fold higher amount of released hydrolysis products in
the presence of 0.5 M NaCl compared to in its absence [ 71]. This behavior is consistent
with that reported for PET6 [64], which also showed an increase in its activity and thermal
stability in the presence of up to 1.5 M NaCl. Similar to PET6, the salt tolerance of SM14est
has been suggested to be attributed to the formation of coordinated bonds between certain
enzyme amino acids and three monovalent ions (two sodium ions and a chloride ion),
which together stabilize the catalytic center of the enzyme [64,71].
The PET27 encoding gene was identified in the genome of Aequorivita sp. CIP
111184 [72], a bacterial strain isolated from Antarctic shallow water sediments [89]. In silico
analyses of the predicted amino acid sequence of PET27 revealed a canonical α/β-fold, a
conserved catalytic triad (Ser153, Asp198, His230), as well as structural features specific
to type IIb PET hydrolases, namely, a three amino acid extension in the loop connecting
β8 and α6, and Trp and Ser residues at positions corresponding to Trp159 and Ser238 in
IsPETase, respectively. However, unlike typical type II hydrolases, which generally possess
two disulfide bridges, PET27 exhibited only one, near the C-terminus (Cys262-Cys285), a
feature more commonly associated with type I enzymes [72]. Consequently, PET27 cannot
be clearly classified into either of the two PET hydrolase types proposed by Joo et al. [74].
Moreover, PET27 displayed a structural feature specific to Bacteroidetes representatives
that were not observed in the other characterized PET hydrolases, namely, a PorC-like
domain at the C-terminus of the protein. This element, which is part of the type IX secretion
system (T9SS), suggested that PET27 is an exoenzyme [ 72]. The purified recombinant
enzyme partially hydrolyzed an amorphous PET foil at 30 ◦C, releasing 872 µM TPA after
a 5-day incubation period (Table 1). This level of product release was 4.7-fold lower than
that determined for IsPETase under the same reaction conditions [ 72]. However, when
compared to other marine-derived PET hydrolases also assayed on amorphous PET films at
25–30 ◦C, specifically, Mors1 and PE-H, PET27 demonstrated a higher amount of hydrolysis
product release (Table 1).
The PET46 encoding gene was identified in the metagenome-assembled genome of
the uncultured Candidatus Bathyarchaeota archaeon B1_G2 [ 73], a strain discovered in
deep-sea hydrothermal vent sediments from the Guaymas Basin, Mexico [90]. To the best
of our knowledge, PET46 is the only PET-degrading enzyme derived from an archaeon to
date. For crystallization and biochemical characterization, the PET46 encoding gene was
cloned and expressed in E. coli [73]. The crystal structure of the purified protein, resolved
at 1.71 Å resolution, revealed high levels of similarity to feruloyl/ferulic acid esterases
(FAEs; EC 3.1.1.73), which are enzymes that degrade hemicellulose and lignin to ferulic acid
and other hydroxycinnamic acids. Specifically, PET46 exhibited an α/β-fold with a core
domain composed of an eight-strandedβ-sheet flanked by sevenα-helices and a lid domain
consisting of three α-helices and two anti-parallel β-strands (Figure 6A). The 45-amino-
acid-long lid domain (Leu141-Val186) identified in PET46 was not reported in other PET-
degrading hydrolases but is a common trait of FAEs, albeit of varying length. Functionally,
this structure was essential for the enzymatic activity of PET46, likely due to improved
PET substrate accommodation in the active site. Additional structural particularities were
observed around the active site, notably in the two loops connecting β4 and α3 (loop
1) and β10 and α10 (loop 2). These loops exhibited high similarity to their homologous
structures in FAEs (Figure 6B) while showing significant divergence from those in type
I and II PET-degrading enzymes. PET46 possessed a conserved catalytic triad (Ser115,
Asp206, His238), consistent with other PET hydrolases. However, it lacked the one or two
disulfide bridges that characterize most PET-degrading enzymes reported to date [73].
PET46′s melting temperature of 84.5 ◦C was almost identical to that of LCC, one of
the best-performing thermostable PET-degrading enzymes [32]. This high Tm suggested
that PET46 is well adapted to function at the elevated temperatures characteristic of the
deep-sea hydrothermal vent environment from which it was isolated. Indeed, the enzyme’s
activity, determined using para-nitrophenyl-decanoate as a substrate, was optimal at 70 ◦C.
The enzyme retained more than 60% of its optimal activity after eight-day incubation at
Mar. Drugs 2024, 22, 441 16 of 32
60 ◦C but lost almost 80% after two days at 70 ◦C. PET46 functioned optimally at pH 7–8
while retaining 50% of its maximal activity at pH 5. Moreover, the enzyme remained stable
in the presence of various organic solvents and metal ions, some of which had a promoting
effect on its activity [73].

The plastic-depolymerizing ability of PET46 was assayed on both amorphous PET
foil and semi-crystalline PET powder with over 40% crystallinity. However, while no
enzymatic activity was observed on the amorphous substrate, after incubation for three
days at 60 ◦C with the semi-crystalline powder, the enzyme released 1624 µM of aromatic
products (Table 1). The main hydrolysis product was TPA (99.1%), followed by MHET
(0.88%) and BHET (0.02%). The preference for high-crystallinity substrates observed in
PET46, also reported for MtCut [69] and Enzyme 606 [43], may be attributed to enhanced
enzyme–polymer interactions in regions of high-crystallinity, where monomers adopt
a more linear arrangement [ 43]. When the PET-depolymerizing efficacy of PET46 was
compared to that of IsPETase and LCC at their optimal temperatures, it was found that
PET46 produced a similar amount of hydrolysis products asIsPETase at 30◦C but a 2.3-fold
lower amount than LCC at 50 ◦C [73]. Moreover, although difficult to accurately compare
due to the use of different PET substrates, PET46′s level of product release was similar to
that of the marine-derived PET-degrading enzymes CMA266C [63], Ple629 [65], and PET6
and its chimeric variants [64] at temperatures between 30 and 50 ◦C (Table 1).
In conclusion, the majority of characterized marine-derived PET hydrolases, with the
exception of PET46, exhibited optimal catalytic activity at relatively low temperatures. This
characteristic, however, represents a challenge for their successful implementation in PET
recycling technologies, which require temperatures near PET’s glass transition point for
efficient depolymerization [47]. Similar to IsPETase, one of the most extensively studied
PET hydrolases active at moderate temperatures [21,91], marine-derived enzymes could
Mar. Drugs 2024, 22, 441 17 of 32
be subjected to mutation strategies to enhance their activity and thermostability. Until
significant progress is achieved in this area, the engineered variants of the thermophilic enzymes
LCC [32,92,93] and BhrPETase [94] remain the most effective PET hydrolases and the most
promising candidates for enzymatic PET recycling [47]. Nevertheless, PET-degrading enzymes
active at moderate temperatures, including those of marine origin, may find application in biore-
mediation strategies aimed at decomposing micro- and nano-plastics in oceanic sediments [21]
and municipal wastewater [47]. In such potential applications, the enzymes’ adaptations to
moderate temperatures and high salinity could prove advantageous.
3. Polylactic Acid (PLA) Depolymerization
3.1. About PLA and Its Biodegradation
Polylactic acid (PLA) is an aliphatic polyester composed of repeating units of
2-hydroxypropanoic acid, commonly known as lactic acid. The monomeric units are
primarily produced through microbial fermentation, utilizing lactic acid bacteria and re-
newable carbohydrate sources, such as corn, sugarcane, or potato. Due to its favorable
properties, including biodegradability, biocompatibility, and thermoplastic behavior, PLA
has gained considerable attention in various applications, ranging from packaging materials
to biomedical devices [4].
Although PLA is generally promoted as a compostable material, its biodegradability is
significantly influenced by various intrinsic and extrinsic factors, such as molecular weight,
crystallinity, purity, and exposure to abiotic factors (e.g., UV radiations, temperature,
moisture, pH), as well as microorganisms with metabolic pathways and enzymes capable
of depolymerizing PLA and utilizing it as a carbon source [95]. PLA can persist for decades
without substantial degradation in environments, such as seawater, soil, landfills, and
home composting systems, where temperatures typically remain below 37 ◦C. In contrast,
under the controlled conditions of industrial composting facilities, where temperatures
exceed 60 ◦C, PLA decomposes relatively rapidly, with significant degradation occurring
within approximately 180 days [96].
Despite its biodegradability potential, PLA faces significant challenges in widespread
adoption for industrial composting or recycling. The current infrastructure lacks adequate
collection systems for biodegradable plastics and sufficient capacity to sort PLA products
at their end-of-life. Economic factors also play a crucial role, particularly the lower cost
of producing biological monomers through fermentation than recycling PLA. Given these
major limitations in industrial composting and recycling, coupled with the fact that lactic
acid is a non-toxic monomer that does not negatively impact microbial soil populations
or global health, it has become evident that the most promising strategy for PLA disposal
is developing methods to enhance its degradation rate in natural environments or home
composting systems [ 4]. For this purpose, microbial PLA-degrading enzymes play an
essential role, as these biocatalysts could be embedded in the PLA matrix, thereby creating
a self-degrading plastic under specific composting conditions [97–99].
The enzymatic hydrolysis of PLA was first reported in 1981 using commercial pro-
teases: proteinase K, pronase, and bromelain [100]. Later, in 2001, the first non-commercial
PLA-degrading enzyme was purified from the bacterial strain Amycolatopsis sp. 41 [101].
Since then, numerous PLA-depolymerases of bacterial and fungal origin have been re-
ported in the literature, as reviewed recently [4,102]. However, amino acid sequences and
detailed biochemical characterization have been provided for only a few enzymes. Indeed,
as of August 2024, the PAZy database [62] lists 38 enzymes with PLA-degrading activity,
some of which (e.g., Proteinase K, Subtilisin) are available as commercial products. These
are generally serine hydrolases from classes EC 3.1 (esterases, lipases, cutinases) and EC 3.4
(proteases) which cleave the PLA ester bonds through a nucleophilic attack by the catalytic
serine’s oxygen on the carbonyl carbon atom present in the ester bond [4].
The majority of PLA hydrolases characterized to date originate from soil and compost
microorganisms, including Actinomadura keratinilytica, Amycolatopsis sp., Lederbergia lenta,
and Thermobifida cellulosilytica. These enzymes typically exhibit optimal activity and stability
Mar. Drugs 2024, 22, 441 18 of 32
at temperatures exceeding 50 ◦C (Supplementary Table S1) [ 62]. A smaller proportion
of the characterized PLA-degrading enzymes derive from microorganisms inhabiting
diverse environments, such as seawater, anaerobic granular sludge, cereals, and lake
sediments. These enzymes often exhibit distinctive catalytic properties, reflecting their
unique ecological niches (Supplementary Table S1). The next section will focus on PLA
hydrolases derived from marine environments and their potential utility in developing
innovative methods for PLA biodegradation.
3.2. PLA-Depolymerizing Marine Enzymes
Of the 38 PLA-degrading hydrolases listed in the PAZy database [62] as of August 2024,
eight (excepting engineered variants) originate from marine sources, either cultured mi-
croorganisms or environmental metagenomic datasets (Table 2). These enzymes are car-
boxylesterases (EC 3.1.1.1) that typically depolymerize PLA under moderate temperatures
(30–35 ◦C) and alkaline pH conditions, often exhibiting tolerance to high salinity. However,
only two of these enzymes, ABO2449 and RPA1511, have been characterized in greater
detail, including analyses of their three-dimensional structures, site-directed mutagenesis
studies, and quantitative enzymatic assays.

The PLA-degrading carboxylesterase ABO2449 was derived from the genome of Al-
canivorax borkumensis SK2 [103], a bacterial strain isolated from seawater and sediment
samples collected from the North Sea [ 107]. The purified recombinant enzyme demon-

strated depolymerization activity against both emulsified and solid poly(D,L-lactic acid)
(PDLLA) substrates with molecular weights ranging from 2 kDa to 90 kDa. However, the
enzyme was inactive against the enantiopure poly(L-lactic acid) and poly(D-lactic acid),
likely due to the higher degree of crystallinity of these polymers. After a 36 h incubation of
the enzyme with PDLLA powder at 35 ◦C, pH 8.0, and 0.1% (w/v) Plysurf A210G, over
90% substrate conversion to lactic acid monomers and oligomers (n = 2–13) was achieved
(Table 2). While the presence of the surfactant Plysurf did not stimulate enzyme activity,
it was essential for achieving such a high PLA depolymerization rate, suggesting that
it may facilitate enzyme binding to the solid substrate. The enzyme exhibited optimal
esterase activity between 30 and 37 ◦C, consistent with its relatively low temperature of
aggregation (Tagg) (Table 2). Moreover, it was active within a pH range of from 7.0 to 11.0
(optimally at pH 9.5–10.0) and tolerated up to 3 M of NaCl, although it performed best in the
absence of salts. Computational analysis of the amino acid sequence and predicted three-
dimensional structure of ABO2449 permitted its classification within the α/β-hydrolase
enzyme superfamily, more specifically, to family V of lipolytic enzymes. This classification
was consistent with RPA1511 fromRhodopseudomonas palustris, but contrasted with other
PLA-depolymerizing enzymes (e.g., PlaM4, PlaM5, PlaM7, PlaM8), which were associated
with esterase family I [ 103]. Despite the enzyme’s relatively high PLA-depolymerizing
activity, the crystal structure of the protein has not yet been solved, nor have improved
engineered variants been developed.
The gene encoding the PLA esterase RPA1511 was identified in the same study as ABO2449
but in the genome ofRhodopseudomonas palustrisCGA009 [103]. This bacterial species has been
found in diverse environments, including swine waste lagoons, earthworm droppings, pond
water, and marine coastal sediments [108]. Similar to ABO2449, the purified recombinant
RPA1511 exhibited depolymerization activity against different PLA substrates with repetitive
D,L units, but not against enantiopure polymers. The enzyme degraded nearly 40% of a solid
PDLLA substrate within a 36 h incubation period at 35◦C and pH 8.0 (T able 2). This conversion
efficiency of PLA to lactic acid monomers and oligomers was 2.3 times lower than that of
ABO2449 under the same reaction conditions. However, this assay was not conducted under
the enzyme’s optimal temperature. Indeed, RPA1511 performed best at 55◦C, consistent with
its Tagg of 70.8◦C. Moreover, it was active within a pH range of from 7.0 to 11.0 (with optimal
activity at pH 10.0) and tolerated up to 4 M of NaCl (with optimal activity at 0.5 M). The crystal
structure of the enzyme, solved at 2.2 Å resolution, revealed anα/β-hydrolase fold with a
core domain composed of eightβ-strands surrounded by sevenα-helices and a lid domain
consisting of fiveα-helices. The U-shaped lid domain is positioned above the serine residue of
the catalytic triad (Ser114, Asp242, His270), leaving the active site cleft open and accessible to the
solvent (Figure 7A). A polyethylene glycol molecule, which could mimic PLA, was identified
in the active site cleft (Figure 7B–D), and its position suggested that the enzyme can perform
both endo- and exoesterase cleavage. Furthermore, site-directed mutagenesis experiments
revealed several residues crucial (i.e., Thr48, Gln172, Arg181, Leu212, Met215, Trp218, Leu220,
and Lys252) or beneficial (i.e., V202A) for PLA hydrolysis, likely due to their involvement in
substrate binding [103].
A recently published study [104] employed protein stability prediction tools and site-directed
mutagenesis to computationally redesign RP A1511 and obtain enzyme variants with improved PLA
depolymerization activity and enhanced thermal stability . Among the various mutant enzymes
created, a variant (designated R5) with five mutations (S153L/I245V/R276D/S128Y/V202W)
demonstrated an 8◦C increase in Tm and superior PLA depolymerization efficiency compared
to the wild-type enzyme. The R5 variant degraded 85% of a solid PDLLA substrate within 72 h
under optimal reaction conditions (65◦C, pH 9.0, and 10 g·L−1 PLA substrate). In contrast, the
wild-type enzyme degraded nearly 60% PDLLA within 72 h at its optimal temperature (55◦C)
and pH 8.0 (T able 2). Based on molecular docking simulations, it has been suggested that the
V202W mutation-induced structural changes in the substrate-binding region leading to improved
enzyme-substrate contact and enhanced PLA depolymerization activity . The other four mutations,
Mar. Drugs 2024, 22, 441 20 of 32
located distal to the active site, have been predicted to increase R5′s rigidity and thermal stability
by forming new hydrogen bonds or strengthening hydrophobic interactions [104].

The other six marine-derived esterases listed in Table 2 have been only partially
characterized to date in terms of their PLA-degrading activity [42,105,106]. The purified
recombinant enzymes were qualitatively tested using agarose-based screenings and demon-
strated the ability to degrade an emulsified PDLLA substrate with a low molecular weight
(2 kDa). These enzymes showed relatively low Tagg (<50 ◦C), suggesting the adaptability to
function under moderate temperatures. Moreover, three (i.e., ABO_1197, ABO_1251, and
MGS0010) exhibited remarkable salt tolerances of up to 3.5 M NaCl [42]. However, detailed
quantitative assays using various types of PLA substrates are necessary to fully understand
the efficiency of these enzymes in PLA degradation.
4. Depolymerization of Other Plastics by Marine-Derived Enzymes
Although plastic polymers other than PET and PLA constitute approximately 93% of the
annual global plastic production [3], relatively few enzymes capable of partially degrading these
materials have been characterized. As of August 2024, the P AZy database lists 101 enzymes active
on polyurethane (30), polyethylene (2), polyamide (21), polyhydroxyalkanoates (16), polybutylene
adipate terephthalate (17), polybutylene succinate (4), and natural rubber (11) [62]. These enzymes
Mar. Drugs 2024, 22, 441 21 of 32
are predominantly derived from microorganisms inhabiting terrestrial environments, such as soil,
sludge, and compost(Supplementary T able S1),while only four (i.e., phaZPst [109]), Ple628 [65,66],
Ple629 [65,66], and P A4-degrading enzyme [110]) are of marine origin. Notably , no enzymes
have yet been identified and characterized for other common polymers, such as polypropylene,
polyvinyl chloride, and polystyrene [62], although various microbial strains and consortia have
been reported to possess degradative potential against these materials [4]. Given the scope
of the present work and the fact that the most potent plastic-degrading enzymes have been
extensively discussed in a recent review [4], this short section will focus on the four characterized
marine-derived enzymes active on biodegradable plastic polymers.
The phaZPst enzyme, isolated from the marine strain Pseudomonas stutzeri YM1006, has
been shown to depolymerize polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) [109], a polyhydroxyalkanoate
often promoted as a substitute for some fossil-based polymers, such as polypropylene and
polyethylene [111]. This enzyme remains stable at temperatures of up to 50 ◦C within
the pH range of 6–12 and degrades PHB into monomers of 3-hydroxybutyric acid (3HB).
In contrast, other PHB depolymerases generally release 3HB dimers [ 109]. Structurally,
this difference has been suggested to be attributed to the fact that phaZ Pst possesses
two substrate-binding domains and recognizes at least two monomeric units of the sub-
strate [112]. However, other specific characteristics distinguishing this marine enzyme from
non-marine PHB depolymerases have not been pointed out.
In addition to degrading PET, Ple628 and Ple629 demonstrated the ability to de-
polymerize polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT), an aliphatic-aromatic co-polyester
composed of terephthalic acid (TPA), adipic acid, and 1,4-butanediol. PBAT is generally
promoted as a biodegradable alternative to polyethylene and is primarily used in the man-
ufacture of agricultural mulch films, plastic bags, and paper coatings [65]. When assayed
on PBAT at its optimal temperature (30 ◦C), Ple629 yielded 265.9 µM of terephthalate-
butanediol monoester (BT) and 18.9 µM TPA after 72 h incubation. At the same time,
Ple628 released less than 50 µM of BT after 144 h [ 65]. By comparison, the most potent
PBAT-depolymerase represented by the engineered cutinase TfCut-DM fromThermobifida
fusca performed the complete PBAT decomposition in 36 h at 60 ◦C, releasing approx-
imately 1.7 mM TPA and 2 mM BT [ 113]. A detailed comparison between the various
PBAT-depolymerizing enzymes described to date, including Ple628 and Ple629, was re-
cently provided by Yang and collaborators [ 114]. Also, some structural and functional
characteristics of Ple628 and Ple629 were discussed in Section 2.2.
The first marine-derived enzyme capable of degrading polyamide 4 (PA4) was isolated
from Pseudoalteromonas sp. Y-5 [ 110]. PA4 is a biobased polyamide that is expected to
replace some widely used fossil-based plastics known as Nylons, such as PA6 and PA6.6 [4].
This enzyme degrades PA4 into gamma-aminobutyric acid oligomers under a range of
conditions: temperatures of 5–65 ◦C (optimal at 55 ◦C), pH 6–10 (optimal at pH 8), and in
the presence of various salt concentrations (up to 1 M NaCl). Computational analysis of
the amino acid sequence and predicted three-dimensional structure revealed a β-lactamase
structure containing serine as an active center residue. The enzyme comprises three do-
mains typically present in other polymer-degrading enzymes: a substrate-binding domain,
a linker domain, and a catalytic domain [ 110]. However, to better evaluate its potential
utility in practical recycling applications, further quantitative analysis of this enzyme’s
activity on PA4 is necessary.
5. Challenges and Perspectives in Enzymatic Plastic Depolymerization
5.1. PET
The field of enzymatic PET depolymerization has witnessed remarkable progress in the
last five years. Currently, the most potent PET hydrolases are LCCICCG [32], LCC-A2 [93],
and TurboPETase [94]. These enzymes were developed through saturation or site-directed
mutagenesis of the metagenome-derived thermophilic enzymes LCC and BhrPETase.
LCCICCG has demonstrated the ability to depolymerize 90% of post-consumer PET waste
(10% crystallinity) within 10 h at 72 ◦C and pH 8. Due to this remarkable performance, the
Mar. Drugs 2024, 22, 441 22 of 32
French company Carbios has announced the industrial use of LCCICCG for enzymatic recy-
cling starting in 2026 [115]. More recently, laboratory-scale studies have shown that LCC-A2
and TurboPETase even outperform LCCICCG. Recent comprehensive reviews [47,116] pro-
vide an up-to-date analysis of these and other wild-type and engineered PET hydrolases,
offering valuable insights into the current state of the field.
Two major factors constrain the economic viability of industrial-scale enzymatic PET
recycling. The first is the necessity for extensive pretreatment of PET waste, including
extrusion and micronization [32]. These processes are essential to amorphize the polymer
structure and significantly increase the surface area available for enzymatic attack, thereby
enhancing degradation efficiency. The second factor is the requirement for continuous
pH regulation during the enzymatic process. As PET depolymerizes, it releases tereph-
thalic acid, causing a progressive decrease in pH. To maintain optimal enzyme activity,
the addition of a strong base is necessary to neutralize this acidity. Both factors contribute
substantially to operational costs and process complexity, presenting significant hurdles
to the widespread adoption of this promising recycling technology [4]. To address these
challenges, future research could focus on developing PET hydrolases that work more
effectively on crystalline PET than on amorphous substrates. Examples of such enzymes
include the marine-derived PET46 [73], MtCut [69], and Enzyme 606 [43]. Understanding
the molecular mechanisms behind these enzymes could provide insights into the mutations
needed to enhance the catalytic activity of high-performing PET hydrolases on crystalline
PET, potentially eliminating the need for extensive pretreatment. Furthermore, the dis-
covery of new PET hydrolases able to tolerate acidic pH is another interesting research
direction because it would minimize the need for soda in pH regulation. A good starting
point in this regard is the marine-derived enzyme PET46, which retained 50% of its maximal
activity at pH 5 [73].
Although more than 100 PET-degrading enzymes have been characterized to date
according to the PAZy database [ 62], none of the wild-type enzymes are suitable for
industrial recycling processes [ 47]. Thus, upcoming research could focus on applying
protein engineering methods (reviewed by Yao et al. [116]) to the most promising wild-type
enzymes (e.g., PET46 [73]). The search for novel protein scaffolds in underexplored extreme
environments, such as deep-sea hydrothermal vents, which, in some cases, combine high
temperatures with acidic pH [90], remains equally important. In this regard, a review of
the strategies used to identify plastic-degrading microorganisms and enzymes has been
recently provided by Zhang and collaborators [117].
In addition to optimizing enzymes for enhanced performance and lifetime under
harsh physicochemical conditions—including the presence of inhibitory products, contami-
nants, and substrates with high crystallinities—numerous other key factors may challenge
the economic viability of industrial-scale enzymatic PET recycling compared to de novo
production or the chemical and mechanical recycling methods. Some of these factors
include the cost of enzyme production, the quantity of enzyme used relative to the amount
of substrate, and the extent of conversion. A study that thoroughly analyzed these as-
pects predicted that PET enzymatic recycling could achieve cost parity with terephthalic
acid manufacturing while also offering substantial reductions in environmental impacts
compared to the production of virgin polyester [118].
5.2. PLA
Widespread adoption of PLA for industrial composting or recycling is currently hin-
dered by inadequate collection systems, insufficient sorting capacity, and economic factors
favoring biological monomer production over recycling. Given these limitations and the
non-toxic nature of lactic acid, one of the most promising PLA disposal strategies is devel-
oping methods to enhance its degradation in natural environments or home composting
systems using PLA-degrading enzymes embedded in the PLA matrix [ 97–99]. In this
field, significant progress has been made recently by Carbiolice, a subsidiary of the French
company Carbios, which has developed an enzymatic product (Carbios Active) that can
Mar. Drugs 2024, 22, 441 23 of 32
be successfully embedded in PLA products during their manufacture [ 119]. This prod-
uct which is based on an engineered hyperthermostable serine proteinase (designated
ProteinTFLTIER) from Thermus sp. Rt4lA triggers the PLA biodegradation under domestic or
industrial composting conditions [99]. Indeed, ‘enzymated’ PLA materials completely disin-
tegrated between 20 and 24 weeks of incubation under home-composting conditions (28 ◦C
and 55% relative humidity) and within 50 days under industrial-composing conditions
(58 ◦C and 55% relative humidity) [99].
While this progress in PLA biodegradation demonstrates the high potential for PLA
disposal through enzymatic depolymerization, we suppose not many PLA manufacturers
would voluntarily choose to include a potentially costly enzymatic product in their produc-
tion lines without a legislative mandate. Thus, this technology may not achieve its maximal
potential without the involvement and support of government authorities to incentivize or
require its adoption.
Furthermore, expanding the repertoire of PLA depolymerases could be beneficial in
designing new processes for disposing of PLA. Considering that only a limited number
of PLA hydrolases have been thoroughly characterized to date, a significant opportunity
exists in the purification and characterization of enzymes from the numerous microbial
strains reported in the literature as possessing PLA-degrading activity [4].
Current marine PLA depolymerases are primarily effective on PLA substrates with
repetitive D,L units, and low molecular weights (2–18 kDa). Future research should focus
on bioprospecting marine habitats for novel microbial enzymes capable of depolymerizing
high-molecular-weight poly(L-lactic acid). This endeavor could significantly enhance the
applicability of these enzymes in PLA composting or recycling processes, where high-
molecular-weight polymers (20–300 kDa) comprising over 95% L-units are common [4].
Plastic-degrading enzymes have demonstrated promiscuous abilities to bind and
hydrolyze various natural and synthetic polymers [ 4]. An intriguing future direction
is to test the ability of the over 100 known PET hydrolases to degrade other types of
plastics, including PLA. This cross-polymer investigation could reveal unexpected catalytic
versatilities and potentially lead to the development of multi-substrate plastic-degrading
enzymes, which would be highly valuable for mixed plastic waste recycling.
5.3. Other Plastics
Although few enzymes active on other plastics than PET and PLA have been thor-
oughly characterized to date, numerous recent studies have reported the identification of
marine microorganisms capable of degrading polyethylene [120,121], polypropylene [122],
polyurethane [123], polystyrene [124,125], polyvinyl chloride [126], polybutylene adipate
terephthalate [127], polybutylene succinate [128], and polyhydroxyalkanoates [129]. Table 3
highlights some of the most promising sources of enzymes capable of degrading these
plastics. Given these findings, future studies are expected to focus on characterizing the
enzymes produced by these microorganisms, thereby expanding the repertoire of known
plastic-degrading enzymes.
To develop effective enzymatic recycling strategies for the most recalcitrant plastic
polymers, there is a compelling need to identify or engineer robust biocatalysts capable of
withstanding harsh physicochemical conditions, such as high temperatures and acidic pH.
In this regard, expanding the search for enzymes in underexplored extreme environments,
particularly deep-sea hydrothermal vents, may prove highly advantageous. These unique
ecosystems often combine high temperatures and acidic pH, potentially harboring microor-
ganisms that have evolved enzymes with enhanced stability and activity under industrial
conditions. By tapping into these extreme marine environments, researchers may uncover
biocatalysts that not only expand our understanding of enzyme diversity but also offer
practical solutions for addressing the global challenge of plastic pollution.

6. Conclusions
Plastic pollution represents one of the most pressing environmental challenges today,
with vast amounts of waste accumulating in terrestrial and marine ecosystems, threatening
wildlife and human health. Addressing this issue requires innovative recycling technologies
that align with the principles of a circular economy. By adopting such approaches, we

can reduce plastic waste, decrease reliance on fossil resources, and lower greenhouse gas
emissions, thereby promoting a more sustainable model for the planet.
Enzymatic catalysis of plastics has emerged as a promising recycling solution to
overcome the limitations of conventional mechanical and chemical methods, which require
harsh physicochemical conditions such as high temperature, high pressure, and toxic
chemical catalysts, leading to large energy demands and hazardous waste generation.
To date, over 200 enzymes have been reported to degrade various synthetic polymers,
particularly PET and PLA. Among them, the most potent were derived from terrestrial
thermophilic microorganisms due to the need for most plastics to be efficiently degraded
at high temperatures (>65 ◦C), close to their glass transition point. However, evidence
regarding plastic-degrading enzymes sourced from marine microorganisms is rapidly
growing, and this review focuses on their potential in advancing recycling technologies.
Marine-derived PET hydrolases, predominantly sourced from cold environments,
such as Antarctic seawater and deep-sea sediments, exhibit optimal activity at relatively
low temperatures ranging from 25 to 50 ◦C. An exception is PET46, which originates from
hydrothermal vent sediments and demonstrates stability at elevated temperatures. These
enzymes typically function optimally in slightly alkaline pH conditions and often exhibit
tolerance to high salinities. However, their low-temperature activity presents challenges
for the recycling of PET, a process that generally necessitates higher temperatures to be
efficient. To address these limitations, there is significant potential for the engineering
of these enzymes to improve their thermostability. Future research could also focus on
developing PET hydrolases that effectively target crystalline PET. Marine-derived enzymes
such as PET46, MtCut, and Enzyme 606 show promise in this regard. Beyond recycling
applications, marine enzymes may find utility in the bioremediation of micro- and nano-
plastics found in oceanic sediments and wastewater, where their tolerance to moderate
temperatures and salinity could prove advantageous.
In addition to PET hydrolases, several marine-derived enzymes have been charac-
terized for their activity against PLA and other biodegradable plastics. Current marine
PLA depolymerases are primarily effective on PLA substrates with repetitive D,L units and
low molecular weights. Consequently, their applicability in PLA composting or recycling
processes is limited, as PLA waste products typically consist of high-molecular-weight
polymers that contain over 95% L-units. Therefore, future research should focus on identify-
ing more effective biocatalysts capable of degrading a broader range of synthetic polymers
beyond PET.
In conclusion, while the currently characterized plastic-degrading enzymes from
marine microorganisms may not surpass the potency of the most effective biocatalysts
derived from terrestrial thermophilic microorganisms, they significantly broaden the range
of available enzymes. This expanded repertoire presents important opportunities for
further protein engineering efforts, paving the way for developing more efficient enzymatic
recycling strategies for plastics.
