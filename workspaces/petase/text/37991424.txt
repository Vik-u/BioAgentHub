INTRODUCTION
Coatings are thin layers of polymers that are applied 
to the surface of materials to improve their appear -
ance or properties. They are used in a wide range 
of industries, including fishery, automotive, aero -
space, medical and leisure. Many coatings consist 
of poly(ester-  urethane)s (PEUs) that are known for 
their excellent mechanical properties, including high 
strength, good fatigue resistance and high abrasion 
resistance (Hojabri et al., 2012 ; Quienne et al., 2020 ; 
Ye et al., 2020 ). Hence, PEUs are used in a variety 
of coating applications to improve the durability and 
chemical and biological resistance of these materials. 
Depending on the chemical composition, coatings 
can also be used to tune the biodegradability of a ma -
terial. However, coatings also add to the complexity 
of a material by increasing the number of polymers 
it is composed of and, consequently, the number of 
molecular building blocks. PEUs thus currently pose

Abstract
Impranil® DLN-  SD is a poly(ester-  urethane) (PEU) that is widely used as 
coating material for textiles to fine-  tune and improve their properties. Since 
coatings increase the complexity of such plastic materials, they can pose 
a hindrance for sustainable end-  of- life solutions of plastics using enzymes 
or microorganisms. In this study, we isolated Halopseudomonas formosen -
sis FZJ due to its ability to grow on Impranil DLN-  SD and other PEUs as 
sole carbon sources. The isolated strain was exceptionally thermotolerant 
as it could degrade Impranil DLN-  SD at up to 50°C. We identified several 
putative extracellular hydrolases of which the polyester hydrolase Hfor_PE- H 
showed substrate degradation of Impranil DLN-  SD and thus was purified 
and characterized in detail. Hfor_PE- H showed moderate temperature stabil-
ity (Tm = 53.9°C) and exhibited activity towards Impranil DLN-  SD as well as 
polyethylene terephthalate. Moreover, we revealed the enzymatic release of 
monomers from Impranil DLN- SD by Hfor_PE- H using GC- ToF- MS and could 
decipher the associated metabolic pathways in H . formosensis FZJ. Overall, 
this study provides detailed insights into the microbial and enzymatic degra -
dation of PEU coatings, thereby deepening our understanding of microbial 
coating degradation in both contained and natural environments. Moreover, 
the study highlights the relevance of the genus Halopseudomonas and espe-
cially the novel isolate and its enzymes for future bio-  upcycling processes of 
coated plastic materials.

a hindrance for the mechanical and chemical recy -
cling of coated plastics. This makes bio-  upcycling a 
promising sustainable end-  of- life solution for PEUs, 
because this technology is potentially suitable for 
complex polymer and monomer mixtures (Ballerstedt 
et al.,  2021; Sullivan et al., 2022). In this envisioned 
approach, biological processes depolymerize the en -
tire plastic product including its coating followed by ei -
ther bio-  recycling or bio-  upcycling. For this, enzymes 
and microorganisms able to depolymerize and metab -
olize PEUs are essential. In addition, many coatings, 
for instance on fishing nets, are subject to mechani -
cal abrasion which releases them into nature, making 
the design and understanding of polymer biodegrad -
ability of high environmental importance. Thus, PEU 
coatings are disseminated into the environment and 
may hinder the recycling of plastics. However, they 
also have the potential to increase the application 
range of biodegradable polymers by protecting sen -
sitive materials and tuning surface properties like 
lubrication, hydrophobicity and abrasion resistance. 
Hence, it is of great interest to establish sustainable 
end- of- life solutions of such products by identifying 
microorganism and enzymes able to depolymerize 
coatings consisting of PEUs.
One of the best-  researched industrial PEU is 
Impranil ® DLN-  SD, an anionic aliphatic PEU used for 
the formulation of textile coatings. Several bacterial 
and fungal species have been described to degrade 
Impranil DLN-  SD including species of Pseudomonas  
and Cladosporium  (Álvarez-  Barragán et al.,  2016 ; 
Biffinger et al., 2015 ; Howard et al., 2001 ; Howard & 
Blake, 1998; Russell et al., 2011). Enzymes of such 
microorganisms were often rashly designated as 
‘polyurethane-  degrading enzyme’ or ‘polyurethanase’ 
without confirmation that the urethane (carbamate) 
bond was hydrolysed. Instead, these enzymes only 
showed polyester hydrolase activity, solubilizing the 
polymer by cleaving the ester bonds present in the 
PEU but leaving the urethane bond intact. Hence, 
these enzymes should be classified as extracellular 
esterases or lipases. So far, no enzymes with true 
polyurethane depolymerizing activities are scientif -
ically described (Liu et al., 2021 ; Wei et al., 2020 ). 
Instead, certain urethanases and cutinases are 
known to cleave only PU oligomers (Akutsu-  Shigeno 
et al.,  2006 ; Branson et al., 2023 ). Nonetheless, 
oxidative enzymes exist that are capable of depo -
lymerizing PU, but in an unspecific mode (Magnin 
et al.,  2021 ). Most enzymes known to depolymer -
ize the ester bonds of Impranil DLN-  SD were origi -
nally identified as polyethylene terephthalate (PET) 
hydrolases, including cutinases such as the leaf 
and branch compost cutinase (LCC), Thermobifida 
fusca cutinase (TfCut2) (Schmidt et al., 2017), li -
pases (Rowe & Howard, 2002 ; Schöne et al., 2016 ) 
or general esterases (Magnin et al., 2020 ). Recently, 
it was shown that members of the niche-  adapted 
genus Halopseudomonas  possess extracellular type 
IIa PET- hydrolases (PE-  H) that are able to hydrolyse 
Impranil DLN-  SD (Molitor et al., 2020 ). Furthermore, 
the PE-  H of Halopseudomonas aestusnigri  ( Haes- 
PE- H) and Halopseudomonas bauzanensis  were 
shown to be active towards PET (Avilan et al., 2023; 
Bollinger, Thies, Katzke, & Jaeger, 2020 ; Bollinger, 
Thies, Knieps-  Grünhagen, et al., 2020 ). However, 
bacterial growth of Halopseudomonas  spp. with 
Impranil DLN-  SD as sole carbon source has not been 
investigated and the metabolic pathways of Impranil 
DLN- SD degradation remain unknown, until now. The 
lack of established tools for genetic engineering of 
this genus further complicates the process of investi -
gating the metabolic routes in detail.
In this study, we aimed to identify and characterize 
novel microorganisms and enzymes for PEU degra -
dation. For this, we performed enrichment cultures 
that led to the isolation of the Impranil DLN-  SD- 
metabolizing bacterium Halopseudomonas formo -
sensis FZJ. The characterization of this strain and 
its extracellular hydrolases highlights their potential 
for biodegradation of several PEUs and gives in -
sights into the corresponding metabolic pathways. 
Moreover, this study reports the first genetic modi -
fication within the genus Halopseudomonas  leading 
the path for exploring this niche-  adapted and biotech -
nologically relevant genus.
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES
Strain isolation and cultivation
H. formosensis  FZJ was isolated from a mesophilic 
compost heap in Würselen, Germany (50.8351551, 
6.1411361). For the initial enrichment, mineral 
salts medium (MSM) (Wierckx et al., 2005 ) was in -
oculated with 10 g L −1 of compost material and 1% 
(v/v) Impranil DLN-  SD (Covestro AG, Leverkusen, 
Germany). Shake flasks were incubated at 30°C 
and 200 rpm shaking speed. After 3 days, the flasks 
were re-  inoculated into fresh MSM medium supple -
mented with 1% (v/v) Impranil DLN-  SD. After five 
re- inoculations, different species were isolated on 
lysogeny broth (LB) agar plates containing 1% (v/v) 
Impranil DLN-  SD. The isolate exhibiting the strong -
est halo formation was selected for this study and in 
the following termed Halopseudomonas formosensis  
FZJ. Strains of Escherichia coli  were cultivated in LB 
medium with appropriate antibiotics if necessary. For 
cultivation of H . formosensis  FZJ, 10 mM of suberic 
acid was added to LB medium to facilitate growth. All 
strains used in this study are shown in Table  1.

BIODEGRADATION OF POLY(ESTER-URETHANE)S
16S rDNA sequencing
For preliminary identification of the isolated strain, 16S 
rDNA sequencing was performed. Genomic DNA was 
purified using a Monarch Genomic DNA Purification 
Kit (NEB) from an overnight LB culture of single colo -
nies. The 16S rDNA sequence was amplified by PCR 
using Q5 High-  Fidelity 2× Master Mix (NEB) as DNA 
polymerase and the primers FD1/2 (5 ′- 3′ AGAGT TTG 
ATC MTG GCTCAG) and RP1/2 (5 ′- 3′ ACGGY  TAC 
CTT GTT ACG ACTT) (Weisburg et al., 1991). PCR 
products were purified with a Monarch PCR and 
DNA Cleanup Kit (NEB) and sequenced by Eurofins 
Genomics (Ebersberg, Germany). The resulting se -
quences were aligned to the nucleotide collection 
(nr/nt) of the NCBI database using BLASTn and hits 
with the highest sequence identities were compared 
(Sayers et al., 2022 ).
Whole genome sequencing
Genomic DNA from strains of interest was purified 
using a Monarch Genomic DNA Purification Kit (NEB) 
from an overnight LB culture. Afterwards, 1 μg of DNA 
was used for library preparation using the NEBNext 
Ultra™ II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB). 
The library was evaluated by qPCR using the KAPA 
library quantification kit (Peqlab, Erlangen, Germany). 
Afterwards, normalization for pooling was done and 
paired- end sequencing with a read length of 2 × 150 
bases was performed on a MiSeq (Illumina). The reads 
of demultiplexed fastq files as the sequencing output 
(base calls) were trimmed and quality- filtered using the 
CLC Genomic Workbench software (Qiagen Aarhus 
A/S, Aarhus, Denmark). Then, the filtered reads were 
used for de novo assembly using the CLC Genomic 
Workbench software. Sequencing data are stored in 
the NCBI Sequence Read Archive under the BioProject 
number PRJNA987411 under accession number 
SRR25019772. The annotated genome of H. formo -
sensis FZJ can be accessed via the accession number 
JAVRDO000000000.
Quantification of NH+
4 consumption
The turbidity of Impranil DLN-  SD in aqueous media 
prevented to analyse bacterial growth via the optical 
density (OD 600). Hence, the consumption of NH+
4 was 
chosen as suitable parameter as it correlates with 
bacterial growth. For quantifying the NH+
4 consump -
tion, a colorimetric assay was adapted from Willis 
et al. (1996). The NH+
4 concentration was reduced to 
300 mg L−1 in the MSM for cultivation. Samples from liq-
uid cultivations were filtered through an AcroPrep™ 96- 
well filter plate (Pall Corporation, Port Washington, NY, 
USA) to obtain the analytes for the assay. In a 96-  well 
plate, 10 μL of analytes (0.5–  50 mg L−1 NH+
4) was mixed 
with 200 μL of reagent A (32 g L−1 Na- salicylate, 40 g L−1 
Na3PO4 × 12 H2O and 0.5 g L −1 sodium nitroprusside 
(Na2[Fe(CN)5NO] × 2 H2O)). After that, 50 μL of reagent 
B (0.25% (v/v) NaClO) was added and mixed. Samples 
were incubated at room temperature for 20 min and sub-
sequently the absorbance was detected at λ = 685 nm

Genetic engineering
The­mutant­∆Hfor_PE- H derived from H . formosen -
sis FZJ was constructed using the I-  SceI-  based sys -
tem (Martínez-  García & de Lorenzo, 2011 ) according 
to the streamlined protocol (Wynands et al., 2018) 
and further optimized to allow genetic engineering 
of H. formosensis  FZJ. The 500–  600 bp up-  and 
downstream flanking regions (TS1 and TS2) of the 
Hfor_PE- H encoding gene (RED13_000930) were 
integrated into the suicide delivery vector pEMG. 
The integration of the suicide vector into H . formo -
sensis  FZJ was performed by patch mating for 24 h 
on LB agar plates. For this, the E . coli PIR2 donor 
strain holding the pEMG-  ΔHfor_PE- H plasmid, the 
helper strain E . coli HB101 pRK2013, and the re -
cipient H. formosensis  FZJ were used. To enable 
expression of sce- I, we constructed pQT8-  sce-  I that 
was recognized by H . formosensis  FZJ after elec -
troporation. For this, the strain was cultivated in LB 
medium supplemented with 10 mM suberic acid at 
30°C overnight. Next, the cells were harvested by 
centrifugation at 16,000  g for 1 min. The cell pel -
let was resuspended in half of the initial volume 
with 300 mM sucrose. After two additional washing 
steps, cells were resuspended in 2% of the initial 
volume in 300 mM sucrose. Next, 1 μg of pQT8-  sce- I 
was added to 50 μL of cells and electroporation was 
performed using DEVICE X (0.2 cm cuvette, 2.5 kV, 
25 μF and 200 Ω). After the electroporation, 950 μL 
of LB medium supplemented with 10 mM suberic 
acid was added and cells were regenerated at 30°C 
for 5 h. Transformed cells were selected on LB agar 
plates containing 20 mg L −1 gentamicin. The suc -
cessful knock-  out of Hfor_PE- H was confirmed by 
DNA sequencing.
Microscopic analysis
Light microscopy pictures were taken on an 
AxioImager M2 equipped with a Zeiss AxioCam MRm 
camera and an C Plan-  Neofluar 100×/1.3 Oil Ph3 ob -
jective (Carl Zeiss, Germany). Images were analysed 
using the AxioVision 4.8 software (Carl Zeiss). For 
Transmission Electron Microscopy, H. formosensis 
FZJ was cultivated with Impranil in MSM for 72 h and 
was adsorbed on CF300-  Cu grids (Electron micros -
copy services) and negatively stained with 2% uranyl 
acetate. Staining procedure by side blotting was car -
ried out as described in Ohi et al. (2004). TEM im -
ages were acquired on a Talos L120C G2 transmission 
electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific) op -
erated at 120 keV with a 4 k × 4 k Ceta 16 M CEMOS 
camera.
GC- ToF- MS analysis
For sample preparation, cultures were filtered 
through an AcroPrep™ 96-  well filter plate to ob -
tain cell-  free filtrates (Pall Corporation, Port 
Washington, NY, USA). Aliquots of 130 μL were 
shock-­ frozen­in­liquid­nitrogen ­and­stored­at­−20°C.­
Prior to analysis, samples were lyophilized over -
night in a Christ LT-  105 freeze drier (Martin Christ 
Gefriertrocknungsanlagen, Osterode am Harz, 
Germany). Two-  step derivatization of the samples 
and GC-  ToF- MS analysis was performed as de -
scribed before by Paczia et al. ( 2012) using a L-  
PAL3-  S15 liquid auto sampler coupled to a LECO 
GCxGC HRT+ 4D high resolution time-  of- flight 
mass spectrometer (LECO, Mönchengladbach, 
Germany). To identify known metabolites, a base -
line noise-  corrected fragmentation pattern together 
with the corresponding current RI value (Retention 
time Index) was compared to our in-  house ac -
curate m/z database JuPoD and the commercial 
nominal m/z database NIST20 (National Institute of 
Standards and Technology, USA). Unknown peaks 
were identified by a virtual reconstruction of the 
derivatized metabolite structure via the measured 
baseline noise-  corrected accurate mass m/z  frag -
ment pattern in comparison to an accurate m/z  frag -
ment register inside the JuPoD main library and 
were subsequently verified by virtual derivatization 
and fragmentation of the predicted structure.
Enzyme production and purification
The expression plasmids including the enzyme-  
encoding genes were codon-  optimized for E . coli 
and ordered from Twist Bioscience, USA and sub -
sequently rehydrated according to the manufacturer 
protocol. Protein production and purification was 
carried out according to Bollinger, Thies, Katzke, 
and Jaeger (2020) and Bollinger, Thies, Knieps-  
Grünhagen, et al. ( 2020) with minor changes. For 
heterologous expression, the E . coli strain LOBSTR 
was used (Andersen et al., 2013 ). For this, a pre cul -
ture was cultivated with 0.5% (w/v) glucose for 24 h at 
37°C. From this, the main culture was inoculated with 
a starting OD 580 of 0.05 and incubated at 30°C for 
24 h under agitation of 160 rpm. The cells were then 
harvested and purified according to Bollinger, Thies, 
Katzke, and Jaeger ( 2020) and Bollinger, Thies, 
Knieps-  Grünhagen, et al. ( 2020).

BIODEGRADATION OF POLY(ESTER-URETHANE)S
Biochemical characterization
Esterase activity was measured using 4-  nitrophenyl 
hexanoate as substrate. The substrate solution was 
prepared from a stock solution of 20 mM 4- nitrophenyl 
hexanoate in acetonitrile mixed 1/20 with 100 mM po -
tassium phosphate buffer with 100 mM NaCl (pH 7.2). 
Ten microliter of the enzyme solution was mixed 
with 190 μL of the substrate solution in a microtiter 
plate and immediately measured at 30°C/40°C/50°C 
in Tecan Infinite M1000Pro (Tecan Traiding AG, 
Switzerland) or Molecular Devices SpectraMax 
iD3 (Molecular Devices, USA) photometers at 
410 nm for 10 min with a measurement every 22 s.

Determination of protein thermal 
melting point
The melting curves of the proteins were measured using 
nano differential scanning fluorimetry (nanoDSF) using 
a Prometheus device (NanoTemper Technologies, 
Inc.). The NanoTemper capillaries were loaded with pu-
rified enzyme at a concentration of about 1 mg mL−1 in 
100 mM potassium phosphate buffer with 100 mM NaCl 
(pH 7.2). The melting temperature was scanned in a 
range between 20 and 99°C at a rate of 1°C per minute.
Enzymatic hydrolysis of PET and 
quantification of reaction products
The hydrolysis of PET films and powder, was deter -
mined as described by Bollinger, Thies, Katzke, and 
Jaeger (2020) and Bollinger, Thies, Knieps- Grünhagen, 
et al.  ( 2020) with minor modifications. The reaction 
mixture in a total volume of 200 μL was composed of 
1 mg mL−1 purified enzyme in 100 mM potassium phos-
phate buffer with 100 mM NaCl (pH 7.2) with 20% (v/v) 
dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and a circular piece of PET 
film (6 mm diameter, Goodfellow Cambridge, Ltd.) or 
5 mg of powdered amorphous PET film. The reaction 
mixtures were incubated in centrifugal filters with a cut-
off (MWCO) of 10,000 Da (VWR International GmbH) 
for a total of 96 h at 30°C. Every 24 h 50 μL of the so -
lution was harvested by centrifugation at 18,900 g for 
30­s­and­frozen­at­−20°C­until­use.­The­reaction­filtrates­
were analysed with an UPLC system (Acquity UPLC, 
Waters GmbH) equipped with an Acquity UPLC BEH 
C18 column (1.7 μm particle size) using the published 
method by (Bollinger, Thies, Katzke, & Jaeger, 2020 ; 
Bollinger, Thies, Knieps-  Grünhagen, et al., 2020 ). For 
terephthalic acid (TA) and BHET, commercially avail -
able standards were used to calculate amounts from 
calibration curves. For MHET, standards were used 
generated by the Winde lab of the University of Leiden 
(The Netherlands) and kindly made available to us.
Enzymatic hydrolysis of Impranil DLN- SD
Degradation of Impranil DLN-  SD was determined by 
measuring the decrease in optical density at 580 nm 
(Islam et al., 2019 ). Ten microliter of enzyme solution 
were mixed with 190 μL of substrate solution consisting 
of 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer with 100 mM 
NaCl (pH 7.2) and 1% (v/v) Impranil DLN- SD. The final 
enzyme concentration used in the assays was 50 nM. 
The loss of turbidity was then measured in a Tecan 
Infinite M1000Pro (Tecan Traiding AG, Switzerland) 
or Molecular Devices SpectraMax iD3 (Molecular 
Devices, USA) photometer at a wavelength of 580 nm 
for 10 min at 30, 40 and 50°C with measurement inter -
vals every 22 s. The absolute value of the calculated 
slope was used as a measure of activity.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Isolation of 
poly(ester- urethane)- degrading 
Halopseudomonas formosensis FZJ
PEU- degrading bacteria were isolated from soil sam -
ples obtained from a composting facility. For this, en -
richment cultures were grown in mineral salts medium 
(MSM) supplemented with 1% (v/v) Impranil DLN- SD as 
sole carbon source at 30°C. After repetitive inoculation 
for two weeks, the enriched organisms were isolated 
on lysogeny broth (LB) agar plates containing 1% (v/v) 
Impranil DLN- SD. Two isolated strains showed remark-
able halo formation indicating the secretion of PEU- 
degrading enzymes (Figure 1A). 16S rDNA sequencing 
of the isolates classified them as a Bacillus sp. and 
Halopseudomonas formosensis. The 16S rDNA of the 
latter shares a sequence identity of 99.92% to that 
of H. formosensis CC-  CY503T (Lin et al., 2013 ). This 
genus was recently re-  classified from Pseudomonas  
into the novel Halopseudomonas lineage (Bollinger, 
Thies, Katzke, & Jaeger, 2020; Bollinger, Thies, Knieps- 
Grünhagen, et al., 2020; Peix et al., 2018; Rudra & 
Gupta, 2021). Many Halopseudomonads harbour a PE- 
H, among them H . aestusnigri (Haes- PE- H) degrading 
not only Impranil DLN-  SD but also PET (Bollinger, 
Thies, Katzke, & Jaeger, 2020 ; Bollinger, Thies, 
Knieps- Grünhagen, et al., 2020; Molitor et al., 2020).

H. formosensis FZJ, was stronger compared to that of 
the Bacillus sp. isolate ( Figure 1A,B), whole-  genome 
sequencing (WGS) of H. formosensis FZJ was per -
formed to screen for putative hydrolases. Genome 
analysis led to the identification of a PE-  H homologue 
in H. formosensis FZJ ( Hfor_PE- H) that shared a pro -
tein sequence identity of 99.7% with the putative PE-  H 
from H. formosensis CC- CY503T and of 80.3% with the 
characterized PET-  degrading Haes_PE- H. Including 
Hfor_PE- H, a total number of 24 hydrolases were iden-
tified of which 14 were predicted to contain a signal 
peptide (Table S1). Such secreted hydrolases may be 
well suited to extracellularly break down the polymer 
into monomers and oligomers that are imported and 
metabolized by H. formosensis FZJ.
The presence of a secreted PE-  H and the ability to 
grow on agar plates containing Impranil DLN-  SD in -
dicated that H . formosensis FZJ is able to metabolize 
the PEU. Growth experiments with Impranil DLN-  SD 
as sole carbon source confirmed the ability of the iso -
late to metabolize the coating ( Figure 1B). Since the 
turbidity of Impranil DLN-  SD interfered with the opti -
cal density (OD 600) that is usually used as parameter 
for monitoring growth, the consumption of NH+
4 was 
utilized to quantify bacterial growth using a colorimet -
ric assay (Willis et al., 1996). Moreover, the increase in 
colony forming units during the cultivation with Impranil 
DLN- SD as sole carbon source confirmed growth 
of H. formosensis FZJ with the polymeric substrate 
(Figure S1). H. formosensis  FZJ was unable to grow 
on Impranil DLN-  SD when no NH+
4 was present in the 
medium, indicating that Impranil was not utilized as ni -
trogen source. Hence, no urethanase is likely present 
in this strain resulting in intact carbamate bonds within 
the polymer.
To investigate whether Hfor_ PE- H was responsi -
ble for Impranil DLN-  SD degradation, we aimed to 
delete the encoding gene to test its effect on growth 
on the polymer. However, members of the genus 
Halopseudomonas were thus far not genetically ac -
cessible. Hence, we adapted the streamlined I-  SceI- 
based system that is well established for engineering 
the genus Pseudomonas  (Martínez-  García & de 
Lorenzo, 2011; Wynands et al., 2018). Since oriRK2 of 
traditional sce- I expression plasmids, such as pSW-  2, 
was not recognized by H. formosensis FZJ, we enabled 
expression of sce- I by constructing pQT8-  sce- I that 
harboured the pRO1600 origin of replication. Indeed, 
FIGURE 1  Growth of Halopseudomonas formosensis  FZJ with different PEUs. Halo formation of the two isolated strains on LB agar 
plates containing 1% (v/v) Impranil DLN-  SD (A). The wild- type H. formosensis FZJ, its knock-  out mutant of Hfor_PE-­ H­(∆Hfor_PE- H) and 
the Bacillus sp. isolate were cultivated at 30°C in mineral salts medium (MSM) supplemented with 1% (v/v) Impranil DLN-  SD (B), 1% (w/v) 
ICO- THANE coating (C) or 1% (w/v) ICO-  FIX coating (D) as sole carbon source. An abiotic control lacking a bacterial isolate was included. 
Impranil DLN-  SD was added as dispersion and the ICO-  THANE and ICO-  FIX coatings were added in powdered form. Growth was analysed 
by measuring the consumption of ammonium ( NH+
4). The mean values and standard deviation (SD) of three replicates are displayed. Light 
microscopy of MSM cultures supplemented with 1% (v/v) Impranil DLN-  SD without (E) and with (F) H . formosensis FZJ was performed after 
72 h. The same H. formosensis FZJ culture was analysed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with negative straining (G and H). The 
presence of H. formosensis FZJ and Impranil DLN-  SD is indicated as well as the image section that was zoomed into for figure H ((G), black 
square).

BIODEGRADATION OF POLY(ESTER-URETHANE)S
pQT8- sce- I was able to replicate in H. formosensis FZJ 
and thus enabled deletion of the target gene resulting in 
the ΔHfor_PE- H mutant. This mutant showed impaired 
growth on Impranil DLN-  SD, thus confirming its activ -
ity towards the polymer ( Figure 1B). Since growth of 
the­∆Hfor_PE- H mutant was not entirely abolished, at 
least one of the remaining 13 putative secreted hydro -
lases must also possess an activity towards Impranil. 
Moreover, a synergistic effect of Hfor_PE- H with fur -
ther secreted hydrolases is conceivable as the polymer 
consists of various ester and urethane bonds that might 
be favoured by different hydrolases. Hence, cleavage 
of oligomers might be favoured by other hydrolases 
than Hfor_PE- H analogous to the synergy of PET-  and 
MHETases during PET depolymerization (Yoshida 
et al., 2016).
Light microscopy confirmed the breakdown of re -
fractive Impranil DLN-  SD by H . formosensis FZJ into 
smaller particles ( Figure 1E– H). Moreover, cells of 
H. formosensis FZJ seemed to be attached to the poly-
mer suggesting that membrane- bound hydrolases may 
contribute to polymer degradation (Figure 1F– H). Using 
Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), the size of 
H. formosensis FZJ was detected to be approximately 
1 μm × 0.5 μm (Figure 1G).
Besides Impranil DLN-  SD, two solid coatings pro -
vided by I-  COATS N.V (Antwerp, Belgium) were also 
metabolized by H . formosensis  FZJ ( Figure 1C,D), 
showing the versatile applicability of this strain for 
coating degradation. These two commercial bio-  
based PEU coatings find application in the textile and 
fishing gear industry and belong to the ICO-  THANE 
and ICO-  FIX family coatings, respectively. To simu -
late realistic biodegradation conditions, they were 
applied to a surface, removed, and micronized be -
fore inoculation. Interestingly, the Δ Hfor_PE- H mu-
tant showed no growth defects compared to the wild 
type when cultivated with these coatings. This could 
be explained by the presence of triacylglycerides in 
these materials. Other secreted hydrolases might 
degrade these compounds and thus circumvent the 
need of Hfor_ PE- H when degrading the ICO-  THANE 
and ICO-  FIX coating. After 72 h of cultivation, both 
ICO- THANE and ICO-  FIX coatings were completely 
depolymerized into the soluble fraction as no solid 
particles were observed.
The majority of Halopseudomonads grow at tem -
peratures between 4 and 37°C (Bollinger, Thies, Katzke, 
& Jaeger, 2020 ; Bollinger, Thies, Knieps-  Grünhagen, 
et al., 2020), whereas H. formosensis CC- CY503T was 
reported to grow in a range of 20– 50°C (Lin et al., 2013). 
To compare the Impranil DLN-  SD- degrading activities 
within this genus at different temperatures, various 
strains were cultivated on LB and MSM agar plates 
containing 1% (v/v) Impranil DLN-  SD. Halo formation 
on LB indicates the ability to secrete PEU-  degrading 
enzymes, while growth and/or halo formation on MSM 
indicates the use of Impranil DLN-  SD as sole carbon 
source. On LB agar plates all tested strains were able 
to degrade Impranil at 30°C (Figure 2A). However, only 
H. formosensis FZJ degraded the polymer at 40 and 
50°C. On MSM agar plates, H. formosensis FZJ showed 
the strongest halo formation at 30°C among the tested 
strains ( Figure 2B). When the temperature was in -
creased to 40°C, H. formosensis FZJ was the only strain 
still able to grow on Impranil. However, no growth or 
halo formation was detected when H . formosensis FZJ 
was cultivated on MSM agar plates containing Impranil 
at 50°C. Overall, these results reveal H . formosensis 
FZJ as thermotolerant strain able to secrete enzymes 
and degrade Impranil at higher temperatures compared 
to other Halopseudomonads. As H. formosensis FZJ 
features a relatively high GC content of 62.8% com -
pared to the other tested strains of this genus (58.5%– 
60.5%) this might be a potential factor contributing to 
its increased thermotolerance. Moreover, the increased 
thermotolerance of H. formosensis FZJ likely originates 
FIGURE 2  Temperature- dependent growth of 
Halopseudomonas  spp. on Impranil DLN-  SD agar plates. Strains 
were cultivated on lysogeny broth (LB) agar plates (A) or mineral 
salts medium (MSM) agar plates (B) containing 1% (v/v) Impranil 
DLN- SD at the indicated temperature for 4 days.

from the compost environment from which it was iso -
lated, which usually encounters higher temperatures 
than the environment of other Halopseudomonads 
such as the ocean or soil (Bollinger, Thies, Katzke, & 
Jaeger, 2020; Bollinger, Thies, Knieps-  Grünhagen, 
et al.,  2020 ). Thermostable enzymes and microor -
ganisms are favoured for depolymerization due to the 
increased polymer chain mobility at elevated tempera -
tures increasing the bioavailability and thus biode -
gradability of polymers (Sullivan et al., 2022; Tokiwa 
et al., 2009; Tsuji & Miyauchi, 2001). Although H. formo-
sensis FZJ is not a thermophilic organism, its thermo -
tolerance compared to other Halopseudomonads and 
Impranil- degrading species can contribute to increased 
biodegradability of PEU coatings.
Biochemical characterization of 
Hfor_PE- H
Given that H. formosensis  FZJ is able to grow on 
Impranil DLN-  SD at higher temperatures than 
other Halopseudomonads, we aimed to character -
ize Hfor_PE- H in comparison to other related en -
zymes in this regard. Therefore, Hfor_ PE- H as well 
as the closely related Haes _PE- H (Bollinger, Thies, 
Katzke, & Jaeger, 2020; Bollinger, Thies, Knieps-  
Grünhagen, et al., 2020 ) and the well-  known PETase 
from Ideonella sakainensis ( IsPETase) (Yoshida 
et al.,  2016) were heterologously expressed and pu -
rified for in vitro studies. The temperature stabilities 
were assessed using a Prometheus NanoTemper 
with a gradient from 20 to 99°C. In this analysis 
Hfor_PE- H (Tm = 53.9°C) did not show exceptionally 
high temperature stability compared to Haes _PE- H 
(55.6°C) ( Figure 3A), indicating that the superior 
performance at higher temperature results from the 
thermotolerance of H. formosensis  FZJ on the cellular 
level as compared to H . aestusnigri .
As­indicated­by­the­∆Hfor_PE- H mutant, Hfor_PE- H 
showed polyester-  degrading activities that were fur -
ther analysed in vitro. For this, the decrease of Impranil 
DLN- SD turbidity was measured over time, which 
corresponds to the hydrolytic activity and depolymer -
ization of the substrate. Hfor_PE- H showed similar ac -
tivities at 30 and 40°C whereas the activity decreased 
approximately two- fold at 50°C (Figure 3B). Compared 
to Haes_PE- H, Hfor_PE- H showed a slightly higher 
activity at all tested temperatures. Notably, Impranil 
DLN- SD incubated with Is PETase underwent a visible 
change in appearance that did not result in a decrease 
of turbidity measured at 580 nm. It might be speculated 
that this enzyme catalysed transesterification reac -
tions under the applied assay condition. Interestingly, 
with the model substrate 4-  nitrophenyl hexanoate (4- 
NPH), Hfor_PE- H showed a remarkable increase in ac-
tivity at 50°C ( Figure 3C). This might be explained by 
temperature- dependent substrate properties that could 
affect the activity of Hfor_PE- H.
Since H. formosensis FZJ showed growth on differ -
ent polyesters, we also tested whether Hfor_PE- H can 
degrade PET. For this, Hfor_PE- H was incubated for 
168 h at 30°C with either an amorphous PET film or 
an amorphous PET foil that was ground to a powder. 
For the ground PET powder, Hfor_PE- H released minor 
amounts of PET monomers MHET and terephthalate 
(TA) (Figure 4A), while almost no activity was detected 
with the less accessible PET foil ( Figure 4B). Overall, 
FIGURE 3  Temperature- dependent activity of Hfor_ PE- H. (A) Melting temperatures of the Hfor_ PE- H in comparison with Is PETase and 
Haes_PE- H. All Halopseudomonas - derived PE- Hs showed increased structural melting temperatures indicating thermostability. (B) Activity 
of Hfor_PE- H and other hydrolases towards Impranil DLN-  SD at different temperatures over 10 min with enzyme concentrations of 50 nM. 
The activity is shown as the absolute decrease of turbidity determined as absorption at a wavelength of 580 nm per minute. As Impranil 
DLN- SD is a suspension, a reaction time of 10 min was sufficient to observe polymer degradation. Exemplary plots of turbidity decrease 
over time are displayed in Figure  S2. (C) Activity of Hfor_PE- H and other hydrolases towards 4-  nitrophenyl hexanoate. The activity was 
measured over the course of 10 min. Error bars indicate the standard deviation (SD) of two replicates.

BIODEGRADATION OF POLY(ESTER-URETHANE)S
Hfor_PE- H showed a higher activity towards Impranil 
DLN- SD but lower activities towards 4-  NPH and PET 
compared to IsPETase and Haes_PE- H. This is in line 
with the fact that H . formosensis FZJ was isolated by 
selection for growth on Impranil DLN-  SD.
Microbial metabolism of 
poly(ester- urethanes)
The extracellular cleavage of Impranil DLN-  SD by 
Hfor_PE- H and the ability to grow on the polymer indi -
cated the release of low molecular weight compounds 
that were metabolized by H. formosensis FZJ. Although 
the exact composition of Impranil DLN- SD is unknown, 
Howard et al. ( 2012) proposed that it is made of poly 
hexane/neopentyl adipate polyester and hexameth -
ylene diisocyanate. To investigate whether H . formo-
sensis FZJ metabolizes these putative monomers of 
Impranil DLN-  SD, the strain was cultivated in MSM 
supplemented with various aliphatic dicarboxylates, di -
amines and diols as sole carbon source. None of the 
investigated diols or diamines with chain-  lengths from 
C4 to C 8 were metabolized ( Figure 5A). In contrast to 
this, dicarboxylates with a chain length of six or higher 
were metabolized by H. formosensis FZJ with a prefer-
ence for the long- chain C8- , C9-  and C10- dicarboxylates 
(Figure 5B). These results suggested that H. formosen-
sis FZJ mainly metabolizes long-  chain dicarboxylates 
that might originate from Impranil DLN-  SD hydrolysed 
by Hfor_PE- H. A protein homology search of the ge -
nome of H. formosensis FZJ identified genes encoding 
homologues to the dicarboxylic acid (Dca) metabolic 
proteins from Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 involved in 
the metabolism of aliphatic dicarboxylates (Ackermann 
et al.,  2021 ; Parke et al., 2001 ). The identified Dca 
homologues were encoded in a nine-  gene and a two- 
gene operon in H. formosensis FZJ ( Figure 5C). Due 
to the additional presence of a CoA carboxylase and 
a hydroxymethylglutaryl- CoA lyase within the identified 
nine- gene operon, it is likely that the encoded path -
way enables the metabolism of acyclic terpenes but it 
might show side activities for long-  chain dicarboxylate 
substrates (Jurado et al., 2015). Additionally, a putative 
transporter, encoded by RED13_001611, was identified 
that could import such dicarboxylates. The transporter 
showed a protein sequence identity of 25.8% towards 
the cis,cis- muconate transport protein (MucK) from 
A. baylyi ADP1 that imports a variety of dicarboxylic 
acids including muconate and terephthalate (Pardo 
et al., 2020; Parke et al., 2001). Due to the broad sub -
strate spectrum of MucK and the fact that no homo -
logue of the dicarboxylate transport system DcaKP 
was discovered in the genome of H. formosensis FZJ, 
the identified transporter likely contributed to the im -
port of C 6-  to C 10- dicarboxylates. Future studies will 
be needed to investigate the role of the identified Dca 
homologues and the putative dicarboxylate transporter 
to confirm their role in Impranil DLN-  SD metabolism.
To further unravel the metabolic pathways for 
growth on Impranil DLN-  SD by H . formosensis  FZJ, 
gas chromatography time-  of- flight mass spectrome -
try (GC-  ToF- MS) was performed on supernatants of 
both in vivo  cultures and in vitro  Hfor_PE- H assays. 
In vitro  depolymerization of Impranil DLN-  SD by 
Hfor_PE- H resulted in the release of four monomers, 
namely neopentyl glycol, 1,6-  hexanediol, adipic acid 
and an unknown compound designated as M_162 
(Figures 6A, 7). These results match the structure of 
Impranil DLN-  SD proposed by Howard et al., with the 
polyester region of the polymer consisting of poly hex -
ane diol/neopentyl adipate polyester. The absence 
of (di-  ) amines after enzymatic hydrolysis confirms 
the inability of Hfor_PE- H to hydrolyse the urethane 
bonds within the polymer. Growth of H . formosensis  
FZJ with Impranil DLN-  SD resulted in the accumu -
lation of neopentyl glycol that is in agreement with 
the inability of the strain to metabolize this monomer 
(Figures 5A, 6B). Although adipic acid was metabo -
lized by H. formosensis  FZJ, it was still present in the 
culture supernatant, indicating that it was released

30°C.

by Hfor_PE- H faster than it could be metabolized 
(Figure 7). Moreover, 1,6-  hexanediol was detected 
and, indeed, this compound could not be metabo -
lized by H. formosensis  FZJ as sole carbon source 
(Figures 5A, 6A). 4-  Hydroxybutyrate was detected in 
the culture supernatant, but not in the enzymatically 
treated sample. This hydroxylated acid is thus unlikely 
to be a constituent of Impranil DLN-  SD, rather, it is a 
possible intermediate of aliphatic diol metabolism (Li 
et al.,  2020 ), indicating that H . formosensis  FZJ can 
partially oxidize the diols ( Figure 7). The fact that the 
putative precursor 1,4-  butanediol was not detected 
in any sample suggests that the 4-  hydroxybutyrate 
originates from partial β - oxidation of 1,6-  hexanediol. 
An unknown compound (M_162) was also detected 
in the culture supernatant of H. formosensis  FZJ. 
Mass spectral analysis of M_162 revealed the chem -
ical formula C 7H14O4 and the detected fragmenta -
tion pattern indicates that this compound could be 
a dimer of neopentyl glycol and glycolic acid namely 
3- hydroxy- 2,2- dimethylpropyl 2-  hydroxyacetate 
(Figure S3). The presence of such a dimer in the cul -
ture supernatant supports our theory that hydrolases 
other than Hfor_PE- H might degrade the released 
oligomers. However, it can only be speculated whether 
3- hydroxy- 2,2- dimethylpropyl 2-  hydroxyacetate is 
cleaved extracellularly or imported into the cell for 
subsequent metabolism ( Figure 7). The absence 
of glycolic acid in the culture supernatant might in -
dicate that the oligomer is directly imported without 
prior cleavage into neopentyl glycol and glycolic acid.

hydrolases in H. formosensis  FZJ supports the theory 
of oligomer import and intracellular cleavage of them 
(Table S1).
Overall, our results unravelled the metabolic 
pathway for Impranil DLN-  SD in H . formosensis  
FZJ. First, Hfor_PE- H and putatively other hydro -
lases are secreted for initial polymer degrada -
tion. Enzymatic degradation of the ester segments 
results in the release of neopentyl glycol, adipate 
and 1,6-  hexanediol of which only adipate was me -
tabolized by the strain via the identified β- oxidation 
pathway. Moreover, short oligomers such as 
3- hydroxy- 2,2- dimethylpropyl 2-  hydroxyacetate are 
likely imported into the cell and might be substrates 
for intracellular hydrolases ( Figure  7). Future genetic 
engineering of H . formosensis  FZJ could expand

BIODEGRADATION OF POLY(ESTER-URETHANE)S
its metabolism by heterologous expression of ure -
thanases and implementation of metabolic routes for 
monomers such as 1,6-  hexanediol or neopentyl gly -
col (Branson et al., 2023 ). Considering these modi -
fications, H. formosensis  FZJ has the great potential 
to function as platform strain for bio-  upcycling of 
PEU coatings with increasing genetic accessibility 
of Halopseudomonads.
CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
PEU coatings, such as Impranil DLN-  SD, are indis -
pensable for tuning and improving the properties of 
the plastic materials they are applied on. However, 
they pose a hindrance for chemical or mechanical re -
cycling. Biodegradation of such coatings is a powerful 
strategy to overcome these hurdles by using enzymes 
or microorganisms capable of depolymerizing the pro -
tective coating layer. In this study, H . formosensis FZJ 
was isolated for its ability to grow on Impranil DLN-  SD 
and was also able to metabolize ICO- THANE and ICO- 
FIX PEU coatings as sole carbon source. In contrast to 
other Halopseudomonads, H. formosensis FZJ showed 
an outstanding temperature tolerance and was able to 
depolymerize Impranil DLN-  SD at up to 50°C making 
it a promising candidate for industrial processes. The 
identified Hfor_PE- H showed higher activity towards 
Impranil DLN-  SD compared to its homologues within 
the phylogenetic lineage. Deletion of the corresponding 
gene led to impaired growth on Impranil DLN-  SD and 
constitutes the first report of a genetic modification of 
a Halopseudomonas bacterium. Overall, the detailed 
characterization of Impranil DLN-  SD metabolism indi -
cated rapid degradation, but only partial metabolization 
of the PEU coating by H . formosensisFZJ. The profund 
knowledge on both microotganism and enzymes in this 
study contributes to the understanding of the interaction 
of microbes with synthetic polymers. Hence, this study 
leads the path for future bio-  recycling strategies aim -
ing for recycling entire plastic materials including their 
coatings.
