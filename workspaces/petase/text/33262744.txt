Plastic has rapidly transformed our world, with many aspects of human life now
relying on a variety of plastic materials. Biological plastic degradation, which employs
microorganisms and their degradative enzymes, has emerged as one way to address
the unforeseen consequences of the waste streams that have resulted from mass
plastic production. The focus of this review is microbial hydrolase enzymes which have
been found to act on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic. The best characterized
examples are discussed together with the use of genomic and protein engineering
technologies to obtain PET hydrolase enzymes for different applications. In addition, the
obstacles which are currently limiting the development of efﬁcient PET bioprocessing are
presented. By continuing to study the possible mechanisms and the structural elements
of key enzymes involved in microbial PET hydrolysis, and by assessing the ability of
PET hydrolase enzymes to work under practical conditions, this research will help
inform large-scale waste management operations. Finally, the contribution of microbial
PET hydrolases in creating a potential circular PET economy will be explored. This
review combines the current knowledge on enzymatic PET processing with proposed
strategies for optimization and use, to help clarify the next steps in addressing pollution
by PET and other plastics.

INTRODUCTION
The use of plastics has become an integral part of modern society, with annual production
exceeding 350 million metric tons (Danso et al., 2019; PlasticsEurope, 2019). Polyethylene
terephthalate (PET), a crude-oil derived synthetic polymer, is currently one of the most extensively
used plastics (Liu et al., 2019). In 2017, PET production capacity reached over 30 million tons
per annum (PlasticsInsight, 2017). Approximately 485 billion PET bottles were produced in 2016,
and an estimated 583.3 billion plastic bottles are predicted to be manufactured in 2021 (Garside,
2019). This polymer consists of repeating units of terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol
(EG) ( Figure 1 ). Due to its light weight, durability and moldability, PET is convenient both in
terms of its production and its utility; where it is used in containers, ﬁlms, and ﬁbers, in addition
to bottles. However, the qualities which have made plastic an attractive resource, are equally as
responsible for the damage that is typically caused once it becomes waste. Mismanagement of

FIGURE 1 | Structure of PET polymer. Polycondensation reaction of ethylene
glycol (EG) and terephthalic acid (TPA) monomers gives polymeric
polyethylene terephthalate (PET), with water as a byproduct.
PET-based material has resulted in its frequent disposal
and accumulation in the environment where its robustness
is problematic, as it is not particularly susceptible to
biodegradation. The high stability of the polymer’s backbone,
together with its crystallinity and surface hydrophobicity are
some of the underlying factors which restrict the natural
breakdown of this plastic (Kawai et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019;
Jaiswal et al., 2020).
As the primary use for plastics is packaging, PET is often
used in short-term, single use applications. Despite the fact that
recycling systems are in place, over half of the PET that is
produced escapes collection, and instead ends up in landﬁlls
or is released into nature. Only a very limited amount of PET
is recycled back into its original form, with the majority being
downcycled into lower quality, non-recyclable plastics (Kawai
et al., 2014). PET waste persists in both marine and terrestrial
environments, which often results in harm or death to some of the
inhabitants. Annually, plastic pollution is considered responsible
for the death of around 1 million sea birds, as well as 100,000
marine mammals and turtles (Jaiswal et al., 2020). Furthermore,
the partial breakdown of discarded plastics and treatment of
synthetic ﬁbers has resulted in the widespread shedding of
microplastics and microﬁbers, respectively (Hiraga et al., 2019).
In this form, plastics readily contaminate marine ecosystems
and this has resulted in them entering the animal and human
food chain, which has been linked to various adverse health
eﬀects, including immune disorders and congenital disabilities,
as well as cancer (Jaiswal et al., 2020). It is now believed
that soils may constitute an even larger sink for plastic, and
since microplastics can readily leach into groundwater, or
contaminate other water reserves, this problem is thought to
aﬀect organisms across the entire terrestrial ecosystem (Song
et al., 2019). Recently, there has been a marked increase in
awareness surrounding the potential detrimental environmental
impact of plastics. Therefore, new solutions and technologies,
which assist in managing plastic waste, are of major importance
(Danso et al., 2019).
Synthetic polymers were once considered resistant to
microbial degradation, however, more recent studies have shown
that certain microbes produce hydrolase enzymes that enable
them to either break down or modify PET. Microbes have evolved
a variety of hydrolytic enzymes that allow them to degrade and
process polymers that are prevalent in nature, for example the
waxy plant polyester cutin. In a somewhat similar way, some
microorganisms are using enzymes to take advantage of PET
as an energy source, despite the signiﬁcant diﬀerences between
the synthetic and natural polymer structures (Danso et al., 2019;
Kawai et al., 2019; Taniguchi et al., 2019).
Enzymes which display PET hydrolyzing activities include
carboxylic ester hydrolase enzymes (EC 3.1.1) such as cutinases,
lipases, and esterases (Guebitz and Cavaco-Paulo, 2008; Kawai
et al., 2020). These hydrolases have been isolated from bacterial
sources such as Ideonella sakaiensis and Thermobiﬁda fusca as
well as from fungi such as Fusarium solani , Humicola insolens,
and Aspergillus oryzae (Wang et al., 2008; Korpecka et al.,
2010; Zimmermann and Billig, 2010). They are typically serine
hydrolases and are characterized by a catalytic triad in their
active site that consists of serine, histidine, and aspartate amino
acids and an α/β hydrolase fold (Remington et al., 1992; Wei
et al., 2014a). Most of the PET hydrolases that have been
functionally veriﬁed also contain a C-terminal disulﬁde bond
which is responsible for promoting thermal and kinetic stability
(Roth et al., 2014; Sulaiman et al., 2014; Then et al., 2016). In
general, carboxylic ester hydrolases are deﬁned by their activity
on p-nitrophenol ( p-NP) acyl esters, whereby lipases act on
medium to long-chain acyl esters ( >C10), cutinases on short
to medium-chain acyl esters (up to C 8–C10), and esterases on
short-chain acyl esters. Although PET hydrolytic activities are
not correlated to p-NP acyl ester speciﬁcity, these substrates are
useful for biochemical characterization of enzymes of interest
(Kawai et al., 2020).
Polyethylene terephthalate hydrolytic enzymes are generating
a good deal of interest from a biotechnological perspective,
particularly with respect to their potential applications in
areas such as biorecycling, biocatalysis, waste treatment and
sustainable polymer modiﬁcations. Cutinases (EC 3.1.1.74) and
cutinase-like enzymes, which are capable of processing high
molecular weight polyesters, have become an important focus
of PET hydrolase studies (Taniguchi et al., 2019). Numerous
PET hydrolyzing enzymes have been biochemically characterized
to date and are shown in ( Table 1). Actinomycetes, especially
Thermobiﬁda species, are of interest for their PET hydrolytic
cutinases and will be among the examples discussed.I. sakaiensis,
which was discovered in PET-contaminated sediment that
was sampled near a Japanese recycling facility, combines a

Carr et al. Microbial PET Hydrolases
cutinase-like hydrolase enzyme termed “PETase” with mono-(2-
hydroxyethyl) terephthalate degrading “MHETase” to enable the
use of PET as a carbon and energy source (Yoshida et al., 2016;
Taniguchi et al., 2019). Strictly speaking, cutinases are deﬁned by
hydrolysis of cutin, but this is often left undetermined as cutin
is not readily available commercially. Cutin degradation is not
crucial for synthetic polyesterase activity, and PET enzymes are
often categorized as cutinases, based on showing near-identical
structures in crystallographic studies (Kawai et al., 2020).
Cutinases that have been shown to hydrolyze cutin, and various
polyesters, can do so under temperature conditions of 40–70 ◦C
and pH 7–9, without the help of cofactors (Furukawa et al., 2019).
Genomic and metagenomic strategies, which allow both
genomic and gene expression analysis of unculturable and
culturable microbes, have broadened the extent to which genetic
information can be explored (Handelsman, 2004; Parages et al.,
2016). The ever-increasing number of genomic and metagenomic
datasets has led to the identiﬁcation of genes of interest, including
those encoding cutinases and PET hydrolase homologs (Hiraga
et al., 2019). For example, functional screening of a leaf-branch
compost metagenome enabled the isolation of LC-cutinase, a
cutinase homolog with PET-degrading activity (Sulaiman et al.,
2012). A metagenome mining approach that searches genome
and metagenome databases has also recently been used to identify
four novel PET hydrolase genes (Danso et al., 2018).
Genetic and protein engineering tools have commonly
been used to increase the plastic degradation capacity of
microorganisms and their enzymes, respectively (Wilkes and
Aristilde, 2017; Jaiswal et al., 2020). For example, recombinant
DNA techniques have enabled the expression of genes for
pollutant degradation in a host that is better suited toward
enzyme production, thus allowing puriﬁcation of large quantities
for application or further study. Substrate range and activity
can be further enhanced using technologies such as site-directed
mutagenesis. At the protein level, enzyme engineering has
been employed to change or modify the protein’s amino acid
sequence, which can lead to increased activity and tolerance
to reaction conditions. The increased availability of enzyme
structural information has greatly facilitated rational engineering
approaches (Sharma B. et al., 2018; Jaiswal et al., 2020). For
example, by introducing mutations, LC-cutinase, actinobacterial
TfCut2, and IsPETase variant enzymes have been generated,
amongst others, and have displayed improved PET hydrolyzing
activities, owing to factors such as optimized catalytic properties
and the relief of product inhibition (Wei et al., 2016; Kawai et al.,
2020; Tournier et al., 2020).
In this review, microbial enzymes for PET hydrolysis will
be examined, along with the current associated bottlenecks and
considerations for progressing toward practical applications.
MICROBIAL SOURCES OF PET
HYDROLYZING ENZYMES
Ideonella sakaiensisEnzymes
A team of Japanese researchers, based in the Kyoto Institute of
Technology and Keio University, have proposed three strategies
that could be employed in the bioremediation and bio-recycling
of PET waste together with other potential applications including
bioconversions, microplastic, and microbead degradation, as well
as PET-surface treatment (Taniguchi et al., 2019).
The ﬁrst strategy is based on a microbial consortium named
“no. 46”, which consists of bacteria, protozoa, and yeast-
like cells, as revealed by light microscopy. This was isolated
following extensive screening of environmental samples for
PET-degrading microorganisms. The group screened wastewater,
activated sludge, soil, and sediment from the site surrounding a
PET bottle recycling plant (Taniguchi et al., 2019). The microbial
consortium was found to both degrade PET and assimilate
the degradation products into CO 2 and water (Yoshida et al.,
2016). No. 46 was also shown to adhere to PET ﬁlm and create
signiﬁcant changes in its morphology, which could be visualized
as ﬁlm decay and/or surface whitening. PET ﬁlm degradation
occurred under ambient temperature conditions at a rate of
0.13 mg/cm 2/day, with 75% of the carbon being catabolized
(Yoshida et al., 2016). Furthermore, microbial consortium no. 46
was shown to retain PET degradation activity for at least 10 weeks
and could be re-cultivated after freezing without losing activity.
Of the estimated 20 types of bacteria within the consortium that
have been identiﬁed, the following were investigated for their
individual roles in the degradation process: Bacillus megaterium,
which creates a bioﬁlm on the PET ﬁlm surface; Rhizopus
sp., which acts within the bioﬁlm to cleave the ester linkages
of the PET polymer to give BHET; Pseudomonas sp., which
further degrades BHET (bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-terephthalate) into
the monomers TPA and EG; and Pigmentiphaga sp. and
Mycobacterium sp., which assimilate TPA and EG, respectively
(Taniguchi et al., 2019).
Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6, a bacterial strain which was later
isolated from the consortium, provides the basis of the next
degradation system (Tanasupawat et al., 2016). This bacterium
is PET-lytic and its growth on minimal medium containing
PET ﬁlm has been shown to be much greater than on control
medium without PET (Taniguchi et al., 2019). When grown
in liquid culture, detection of PET hydrolysates was negligible,
demonstrating the ability of I. sakaiensis to completely degrade
and assimilate PET with CO 2 as a complete oxidation product.
The rate of I. sakaiensis degradation was around twice that of the
microbial consortium no. 46 from which it was isolated. These
I. sakaiensis bacterial cells were shown to adhere onto PET ﬁlm
via appendages that may also facilitate enzyme delivery during
the attack (Taniguchi et al., 2019).
The ﬁnal approach is based on employing novel enzymes
identiﬁed in I. sakaiensis. A single open reading frame sharing
51% amino acid sequence identity with TfH, a known T. fusca
PET hydrolase, was identiﬁed in the I. sakaiensis genome
(M¸ller et al., 2005; Taniguchi et al., 2019). The corresponding
recombinant protein released PET degradation products into
aqueous medium and PET ﬁlm exhibited crater-like pitting
when exposed to the enzyme (Taniguchi et al., 2019). This
I. sakaiensis cutinase-like enzyme, referred to as “PETase”
(or IsPETase), was subsequently found to have the highest
catalytic preference for PET, when compared with known PET
hydrolytic enzymes such as TfH, F. solani fungal cutinase

Carr et al. Microbial PET Hydrolases
FIGURE 2 | Proposed mechanism for PET processing in Ideonella sakaiensis. Extracellular PETase enzyme acts on PET polymer chains to give oligomeric
mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET), the monoester of terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG). Intermediates are transported through a membrane
protein before reaching MHETase, which degrades MHET into TPA and EG. Finally, monomers are transported into the cytoplasm to be metabolized.
(FsC) (Silva et al., 2005) and LC-cutinase (LCC) (Sulaiman
et al., 2012). These enzymes were assessed in terms of their
activity against PET ﬁlm and against highly crystallized, bottle-
derived commercial PET (hc-PET), when incubated for 18 h
at 30 ◦C. When compared on this PET ﬁlm, the activity of
IsPETase was determined to be 120, 5.5, and 88 times as high
as that of TfH, LCC and FsC, respectively (Yoshida et al.,
2016). The eﬃciency and speciﬁcity of IsPETase with regards
to PET hydrolysis makes it a promising candidate for new
biodegradation strategies (Taniguchi et al., 2019). However, it
is important to consider that IsPETase operates well under
moderate temperature conditions, whereas the other enzymes
included in this study are optimally active at higher temperatures
due to their thermophilicity.
The primary product of IsPETase hydrolysis is mono(2-
hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET), which is broken down
into the monomers, terephthalate (TPA) and ethylene glycol
(EG), by a second I. sakaiensis enzyme called MHETase. This
MHETase is a member of the tannase enzyme family and has
been shown to degrade MHET into TPA and EG, with a catalytic
eﬃciency ( kcat/Km) of 4200 ±370 s −1 mM−1. Interestingly,
MHETase displays little activity on other ester compounds. Both
PETase and MHETase enzymes were assigned new Enzyme
Commission (EC) numbers, 3.1.1.101, and 3.1.1.102, respectively,
and their role in a PET metabolic model was subsequently
proposed ( Figure 2 ). IsPETase, which acts extracellularly, ﬁrst
converts PET into oligomers (mainly MHET). PET hydrolysates
are then transported, through an outer membrane protein
(e.g., porin) into the periplasmic space and further hydrolyzed
by MHETase into PET monomers (Taniguchi et al., 2019).
MHETase is predicted to be a lipoprotein, which is likely to
be anchored in the outer membrane. A lid domain, which
confers its speciﬁcity and activity toward MHET, has also
been proposed (Yoshida et al., 2016). A TPA transporter
coupled with a TPA-binding protein is likely to be responsible
for taking TPA up into the cytoplasm (Hosaka et al.,
2013). It is thought that TPA subsequently enters the central
tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle via protocatechuic acid, while
EG is also catabolized in the TCA cycle via glyoxylic acid
(M¸ckschel et al., 2012).
Structural analysis is important in providing useful
information for subsequent protein engineering approaches,
which may help in redesigning enzymes to make them
more amenable for industrial applications (Taniguchi et al.,
2019). Several groups have elucidated the crystal structure of
IsPETase, revealing features shared by lipases (EC 3.1.1.3) and
cutinases (EC 3.1.1.74), along with unique characteristics that
diﬀerentiate the enzyme from cutinases previously recognized
for PET hydrolysis (Han et al., 2017; Austin et al., 2018;
Fecker et al., 2018; Joo et al., 2018; Liu et al., 2018). IsPETase
has been expressed recombinantly from a codon-optimized
gene in various E. coli host strains to facilitate generation
of the crystal structure. The enzyme has a basic structure
that resembles other PET hydrolyzing enzymes, featuring
an α/β hydrolase fold and a nucleophile-His-acid catalytic
triad. The α/β serine hydrolase family displays a catalytic
mechanism based on a nucleophilic attack on the substrate’s
ester bond by serine, which is activated via the other triad

Carr et al. Microbial PET Hydrolases
residues (Taniguchi et al., 2019). This involves serine linking
to the ester carbonyl group to form a covalent tetrahedral
intermediate that is later stabilized by two hydrogen bonds
between amide bonds of the residues in a nearby oxyanion
hole (Jaeger et al., 1994; Chen et al., 2013). In the case of
IsPETase, the α/β hydrolase fold consists of nine β-strands
that form a twisted central β-sheet conformation, surrounded
by six α-helices (Chen et al., 2018), while Ser160-His237-
Asp206 comprise the catalytic triad residues (Joo et al., 2018;
Liu et al., 2019).
Upon structural comparison with known PET hydrolytic
enzymes, including TfCut2 and LCC, IsPETase exhibits a notably
wider active site and has an elongated substrate binding cleft,
which is composed of two subsites (I and II). Four MHET
moieties bind at subsites I, IIa, IIb, and IIc during PET
degradation (Joo et al., 2018). Site I contains a cleavage site where
ester bond breakage occurs. The enzyme also has an additional
disulﬁde bond in its active site. The distinguishing features of
IsPETase are detailed below (Taniguchi et al., 2019):
(1) In subsite II, a pair of Trp159-Ser238 residues ensure
there is adequate space for the substrate to bind. PET binding
is obstructed by residues at the corresponding site in cutinases
(e.g., His169-Phe249 pair in TfCut2) (Taniguchi et al., 2019).
The width of the IsPETase substrate binding pocket has been
reported to be crucial for eﬀective hydrolysis of crystallized PET
(Liu et al., 2018).
(2) IsPETase has an extended connecting loop due to three
additional residues, Ser245, Asn246, and Gln247. This also
creates more space for PET to bind (Taniguchi et al., 2019).
(3) IsPETase has two disulﬁde bonds, 1 and 2 (Taniguchi
et al., 2019). Previously studied cutinases only possess disulﬁde
bond 1, with disulﬁde bond 2 being unique to IsPETase.
This extra disulﬁde bond connects the alpha and beta loops
which contain the catalytic triad. It is also responsible for
higher active site ﬂexibility compared to PET-active cutinases
(Taniguchi et al., 2019). This ﬂexibility enables IsPETase to
accommodate the rigidity of the PET substrate without impairing
the enzyme’s structural integrity. Removal of disulﬁde bond 2
results in reduced activity and weakening of the catalytic triad
(Fecker et al., 2018).
Following a study based on structural and biochemical
analyses of IsPETase, Joo et al. (2018) have proposed a detailed
molecular mechanism for this enzyme. A four-MHET molecule
called 2-HE(MHET) 4 was used to mimic PET in a covalent
docking model to facilitate elucidation of the substrate binding
mode. At the catalytic center, triad residue Ser160 functions as
a covalent nucleophile which acts on the carbonyl carbon atom
of the ester bond, as seen in other carboxylesterase enzymes.
The nitrogen atoms of amino acids Tyr87 and Met160 form an
oxyanion hole which stabilizes the tetrahedral intermediate of the
reaction. This stimulates the substrate binding site to form a long,
shallow cleft, which is primarily hydrophobic. The ﬁrst MHET
moiety is bound to subsite I, while the second, third, and fourth
moieties are accommodated by subsite II. Binding is mediated
and stabilized largely by hydrophobic interactions, although
certain residues also lead to polar and π–π interactions. Various
site-directed mutagenesis experiments were used to verify the
key residues in catalysis and substrate binding. This group also
presented a molecular mechanism for the degradation of PET,
which involves two steps: nick generation and terminal digestion.
Once the secreted IsPETase has bound to the PET surface via
its hydrophobic substrate binding cleft, the scissile ester bond
is positioned closer to the nucleophilic Ser160. This enables the
cleavage of one ester bond, creating a nick in PET and resulting
in two PET chains with diﬀerent terminals (TPA-terminal and
HE-terminal), that are then digested into MHET monomers. As
there are some variations in the digestion process depending
on the terminal type, and because the digestions occur in a
combinatorial manner, MHET, TPA, BHET, and EG accumulate,
with BHET undergoing further degradation into MHET and
EG. Interestingly, although IsPETase does not hydrolyze MHET
to TPA and EG, a signiﬁcant amount of TPA accumulates
during the degradation reaction, which is believed to be related
to digestion of the TPA-terminal described in this mechanism
(Joo et al., 2018).
Furthermore, Chen et al. (2018) summarized recent
crystallographic studies, in addition to their own work,
to help uncover the key catalytic features of IsPETase and
information regarding its underlying mechanism of action.
Residue Trp156, which is found near the catalytic center, is
thought to have a central role in binding the PET substrate.
Although Trp156 is highly conserved across PET hydrolyzing
enzymes, “Trp156 wobbling, ” whereby the residue displays three
diﬀerent conformations, is exclusive to IsPETase. In this enzyme,
“Trp156 wobbling” is coupled to Ser185, which corresponds
to a bulky His residue in homologous structures, that would
usually prevent Trp from adopting more than one conformation.
A variant created by mutating Ser to His at position 185 resulted
in decreased activity and indicated that the performance of
IsPETase is at least partially inﬂuenced by the smaller Ser185
residue, as it allows more space for Trp156 to rotate (Han et al.,
2017; Chen et al., 2018). Using substrate and product analogs
of PET to study the substrate-binding mode, the group have
also proposed a mechanism of action for IsPETase whereby
the enzyme ﬁrst forms a shallow, superﬁcial cleft, within which
“Trp156 wobbling” takes place. Next, primarily via hydrophobic
interactions, PET substrate binds with its carbonyl group
positioned at the catalytic center and its O atom facing the
oxyanion hole, while the Trp156 indole ring interacts with the
aromatic TPA moiety of PET. Then, successive formation of
acyl-enzyme intermediate and cleavage of the ester bond occur
in a nucleophilic attack by water (hydrolytic reaction). Finally,
the product is rotated and released from the catalytic center
following interaction of the benzoic acid group with Trp156
(Chen et al., 2018).
With respect to PET hydrolase enzymatic mechanisms, while
much progress has been made, the exact details remain to be
conclusively determined. In response to Joo et al. (2018), another
group have argued that the ﬂexible oligomeric 2-HE(MHET) 4
substrate employed in this study is not representative of the
highly rigid PET polymer chain, and it is unlikely that the
IsPETase catalytic mechanism involves simultaneous binding of
all four MHET moieties and the occurrence of conformational
changes in PET that perfectly match the binding cleft (Wei

Carr et al. Microbial PET Hydrolases
et al., 2019). Instead, Wei et al. (2019) propose that hydrolysis
of amorphous PET is facilitated by weak interactions between
its aromatic phenylene units and the nearby hydrophobic amino
acids of the enzyme. This hypothesis is based on phenylene
ring motions, which are more inclined to arise compared with
the rigid EG units that directly ﬂank the ester bond (Wei
et al., 2019). Although cutinase catalytic mechanisms have also
been explored by studying enzyme structures complexed with
inhibitors and natural substrate analogs, the precise binding
mode of PET and the underlying mechanism of cutinase PET
hydrolysis requires further investigation, as the structure of
PET is very diﬀerent to cutinase substrates, such as cutin and
triglyceride (Han et al., 2017).
While I. sakaiensis and its enzymes are well-studied and have
gained much interest as a PET degradation system, other relevant
microorganisms and enzymes have also been identiﬁed and will
now be discussed.
Actinobacterial Enzymes
Thermobiﬁda fusca , a thermophilic actinomycete, is one of the
multiple Actinobacterial strains that have been recognized as
producers of enzymes for PET hydrolysis (M¸ller et al., 2005;
Wei and Zimmermann, 2017a). T. fusca DSM43793 has been
shown to produce two similar hydrolases, BTA-1 (commonly
referred to as TfH) and a BTA-2, whileT. fusca KW3, a moderate
thermophile, has been reported to produce TfCut1 and TfCut2
cutinases (EC 3.1.1.74). T. fusca YX has been shown to produce
Tfu_0882 and Tfu_0883, which are lipases (EC 3.1.1.3) (Wei
and Zimmermann, 2017a). In one study, Thf42_Cut1 cutinase
from T. fusca DSM44342 was reported to hydrolyze PET
alongside Thc_Cut1 and Thc_Cut2 cutinases from another
Thermobiﬁda species, namely Thermobiﬁda cellulosilytica
(Herrero Acero et al., 2011). Additionally, Thermobiﬁda
alba and Thermobiﬁda halotolerans are of interest for their
PET hydrolyzing enzymes (Ribitsch et al., 2012a,b). Other
known actinobacterial PET hydrolytic enzymes that have been
described include those from the genera Saccharomonospora and
Thermomonospora (Table 1).
TfH (BTA-1), a cutinase enzyme which was isolated by M¸ller
et al. (2005), was used to degrade melt-pressed PET bottles over
a 3 week period at 55 ◦C, with its weight being reduced by
approximately 50%. This oﬀered a marked improvement over the
chemical hydrolysis of PET, which typically requires much higher
temperatures, and had the added beneﬁt of reducing unwanted
side products and generating monomers of higher purity for
repolymerization. While TfH shares 65% sequence similarity with
a lipase from Streptomyces albus, it diﬀers from lipases, which can
only break ester bonds at a hydrophobic surface, in that it has
additional esterase activity that enables hydrolysis of dissolved
esters (Mueller, 2006).
Thermobiﬁda fusca hydrolases BTA-2, Tfu_0882, TfCut1,
TfCut2, and TfH have been assessed for their degradation
capabilities on amorphous (non-crystalline) PET ﬁlm (Wei and
Zimmermann, 2017a). When incubated between 55 and 65 ◦C
for 48 h, ﬁlm weight losses of up to 4, 5, 11, 12, and 14% were
observed for these ﬁve enzymes, respectively (Then et al., 2015;
Wei and Zimmermann, 2017a). TfCut2 variants have been shown
to achieve 25% weight loss of the same ﬁlm using temperature
conditions of 65–80 ◦for 48 h (Then et al., 2015) and 45% after
50 h incubation at 65 ◦C (Wei et al., 2016). Both TfCut1 and
TfCut2, along with their variants, have already been successfully
applied in textile ﬁnishing processing for PET ﬁber surface
modiﬁcation (Zimmermann and Billig, 2010; Wei et al., 2014b).
In a study on TfCut2 cutinase, the enzyme was crystallized in
both free and inactivated forms before structural and functional
characterization (Roth et al., 2014). Combined with molecular
models, the structural components responsible for substrate and
product speciﬁcity were analyzed. TfCut2 displayed a standard
α/β hydrolase fold and a S130-H208-D176 catalytic triad was
found in a crevice on the enzyme surface and the highly resolved
structure provided an appropriate foundation for enzyme
engineering. The thermostability of TfCut2 was also investigated
by comparison with a less stableT. alba AHK119 homolog. While
the melting temperature ( Tm) of TfCut2 appeared to be 70 ◦C
when measured by temperature-dependent CD spectroscopy,
loss of activity was measured experimentally at 61◦C (Roth et al.,
2014). Despite this, TfCut2 displayed improved thermal stability
when compared with other characterized bacterial cutinases (EC
3.1.1.74). It is believed that denaturation may be prevented in
TfCut2 by the presence of a disulﬁde bridge between Cys241
and Cys259 which may stabilize a highly ﬂexible region nearby
that surrounds residues 245–247. Residues at the boundary of
the active site also exhibit high levels of ﬂexibility in relation
to their overall structure, possibly helping to enable induced
ﬁt for catalysis. Flexibility in some areas can be susceptible to
local unfolding which might explain the lower Tm seen in the
activity assay. This analysis also suggested that the optimized
amino acid sequence pattern and hydrogen bond network of
this enzyme contribute to its thermostability (Roth et al., 2014;
Taniguchi et al., 2019).
Thc_Cut1, Thc_Cut2, and Thf42_Cut1, three cutinases which
are closely related, were compared based on their hydrolytic
activities toward bis(benzoyloxyethyl)-terephthalate (3PET), a
short-chain PET model substrate, in addition to PET ﬁlm with
37% crystallinity (Herrero Acero et al., 2011). The enzymes
were incubated at 50 ◦C with the 3PET assay proceeding for
72 h and the PET ﬁlm treatment requiring 120 h, shaking
at 130rpm. HPLC (high-performance liquid chromatography)
was used to quantify the resulting hydrolysates. Of the
three enzymes tested, Thc_Cut1 was found to release MHET
and TPA from both PET and 3PET to the greatest extent.
For both Thc_Cut1 and Thf42_Cut1, TPA was found to
be the major product of hydrolysis, indicating more rapid
processing of MHET, which was in higher abundance following
treatment using Thc_Cut2. Although Thc_Cut1 and 2 had
93% homology, varying enzyme surface properties appeared to
be responsible for the signiﬁcant activity diﬀerences observed
(Herrero Acero et al., 2011).
Another cutinase enzyme from T. alba called Tha_Cut1
was assessed for hydrolysis of 3PET and PET ﬁlms (Ribitsch
et al., 2012a), based on the previously mentioned methods
used for Thc_Cut1 and 2 (Herrero Acero et al., 2011). For
the 3PET assay, the well-studied fungal cutinase HiC was
compared with Tha_Cut1 and although HiC released twice as

Carr et al. Microbial PET Hydrolases
many overall hydrolysates, it was determined than the two
enzymes had distinct substrate speciﬁcities, with Tha_Cut1
releasing 35 times the amount of a hydrolysis product called
2-hydroxyethyl benzoate (HEB). This comparison provided
further insights into the mechanism of Tha_Cut1, revealing
the main products of 3PET hydrolysis to be MHET and
HEB, indicating eﬃcient hydrolysis of the ester bond between
them. Tha_Cut1 displayed a high similarity to Thc_Cut1 from
T. cellulosilytica , with a diﬀerence of just four amino acids
that are located in a key region involved in substrate-enzyme
interaction (Ribitsch et al., 2012a). In addition, two cutinase-
like polyesterase enzymes Est1 and Est119 from tandem genes
in T. alba AHK119 have been shown to have broad substrate
speciﬁcity for various polyesters. Puriﬁed Est119 has been
biochemically characterized, revealing highest kinetic activities
(Vmax and kcat) toward short-chain p-nitrophenyl butyrate
(p-NPB). However, the enzyme Km values showed a higher
aﬃnity for longer chain (C 6 and C 8) acyl esters, indicating
that Est119 is a cutinase-like enzyme rather than a true lipase
or esterase (Thumarat et al., 2012). For both Est119 and Est1,
optimum temperature and pH were recorded as 50 ◦C and pH
6.0, respectively (Thumarat et al., 2015). Despite the enzymes
displaying 98% similarity with each other, Est1 displayed higher
activity and thermostability (Kawai et al., 2013). More recently,
an Est1 (A68V/T253P) variant was shown to have the highest
thermostability when compared with wild-type and mutant Est1
and Est119 enzymes. Est1 (A68V/T253P) was assayed with 3PET
and PET ﬁlm, shaking for 3 h at 50 ◦C, and was noted for its
PET surface hydrophilization and polyester degradation abilities
(Thumarat et al., 2015).
Cut190 is a cutinase enzyme from Saccharomonospora viridis
AHK190. Following mutational analysis, one variant Cut190
(S226P/R228S) that was generated, displayed particularly high
activity and thermostability (Kawai et al., 2014). This variant
remained stable up to 65 ◦C and over a pH range of between
5 and 9 when incubated for 24 h, while also retaining 40% of
its activity when incubated at 70 ◦C for 1 h. Various aliphatic
and aliphatic-co-aromatic polyester ﬁlms were also shown to be
eﬃciently degraded by Cut190 (S226P/R228S) and the enzyme
even hydrolyzed PET ﬁlm above 60 ◦C. Both the wild-type and
mutant Cut190 are dependent on Ca 2+ ions to assist in their
activity and thermostability (Kawai et al., 2014).
Tcur0390 and Tcur1278 are two hydrolase enzymes from
Thermomonospora curvata DSM43183, the genes for which
were identiﬁed following genome scanning analysis of the
strain and were found to display 61% sequence identity with
TfCut2 from T. fusca (Wei et al., 2014a). Enzyme activity was
subsequently investigated using polycaprolactone (PCL) and
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) nanoparticle assays. While
Tcur0390 displayed higher hydrolytic activity than Tcur1278
at temperatures up to 50 ◦C, only Tcur1278 was capable of
hydrolyzing PET nanoparticles when temperatures were elevated
to 55 and 65◦C. Relatively low thermal stability was observed for
both Tcur1278 and Tcur0390 at their optimal temperatures (60
and 55◦C, respectively), with an irreversible activity loss of over
65% following incubation for just 10 min. The optimal pH for
both enzymes is pH 8.5 (Wei et al., 2014a).
In a study that employed anin silico-based screening approach
to interrogate 52 genomes from the Streptomyces genus, a
potential PETase-like gene was identiﬁed in Streptomyces sp.
SM14 (Almeida et al., 2019). Heterologous expression of the gene
in Escherichia coli resulted in the extracellular production of an
enzyme, SM14est, that was shown to have polyesterase activity
on polycaprolactone, the model substrate for plastic degradation
(Almeida et al., 2019). SM14 is a marine sponge-derived isolate
which may have been exposed to plastics and/or microplastics,
resulting from its association with the ﬁlter-feeding sponge
Haliclona simulans . Subsequent amino acid sequence analysis
and comparison of SM14est with the well-described IsPETase
revealed that the serine hydrolase motif Gly-x1-Ser-x2-Gly and
the Ser-Asp-His catalytic triad are conserved in both enzymes.
However, SM14 displays key diﬀerences in its catalytic sub-site II
residues as well as an absence of the two disulﬁde bonds and the
extended loop featured in IsPETase, which may contribute to a
reduced eﬃciency in PET binding and hydrolysis (Joo et al., 2018;
Almeida et al., 2019).
Bacterial enzymes of interest for PET hydrolysis are not
limited to those derived from actinomycetes, with other examples
including a Bacillus subtilis esterase (Ribitsch et al., 2011), a
cutinase from Pseudomonas mendocina (Yoon et al., 2002), and
a Burkholderia spp. lipase (Lee and Chung, 2009). In 2019, the
draft genome sequences of ﬁve bacterial isolates, from Bacillus
and Pseudomonas species, were deposited in Genbank (León-
Zayas et al., 2019). As a consortium, these isolates synergistically
degraded 100mg of granular PET to give a weight loss of 3.15 mg
(∼3% reduction rate), following 6-weeks at 30 ◦C (León-Zayas
et al., 2019). Most recently, Bollinger et al. (2020) identiﬁed
a polyester degrading carboxylesterase (EC 3.1.1.1) within the
genome of the mesophilic marine bacterium Pseudomonas
aestusnigri. The enzyme, named PE-H, was revealed as a PET
hydrolytic enzyme (type IIa), based on amino acid sequence
homology. The group also solved the enzyme’s crystal structure,
which featured the canonical α/β hydrolase fold and showed
high homology to known polyesterases. PE-H was shown to
hydrolyze amorphous PET ﬁlm at 30 ◦C, with intermediate
MHET released as a product. Although the wild-type enzyme
failed to hydrolyze a commercial PET bottle-based ﬁlm, a variant
of PE-H (Y250S), which displayed some hydrolytic activity
toward PET in this form, was obtained using rational mutagenesis
(Bollinger et al., 2020).
Fungal Enzymes
Cutinases (EC 3.1.1.74) from fungi have also shown activity
toward PET as a substrate, with members of the Fusarium and
Humicola genera, representing the most signiﬁcant sources of
these enzymes (Danso et al., 2019).
The activities of Fusarium solani pisi cutinase (FsC) and
Humicola insolens cutinase (HiC) have previously been evaluated,
on both low-crystallinity and biaxially oriented PET ﬁlms having
7 and 35% crystallinity, respectively (Ronkvist et al., 2009). Using
a pH-stat based assay, the cutinases were shown to be 10-fold
more active on low crystallinity PET over the biaxially oriented
ﬁlm. HiC was shown to be capable of completely degrading low
crystallinity PET ﬁlm with 97% (±3%) weight loss being observed
Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 8 November 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 571265

Carr et al. Microbial PET Hydrolases
within 96 h. Further analysis of degradation products indicated
that the water-soluble degradation products consisted exclusively
of TPA and EG. Despite its preference for amorphous PET, the
HiC enzyme was suﬃciently active on crystalline PET regions to
enable its full degradation. In comparison, a weight loss of just 5%
was achieved by the FsC enzyme on low-crystallinity PET ﬁlm.
While FsC performed optimally at 50 ◦C, HiC displayed higher
thermostability, maintaining maximum initial activity between
70 and 80◦C (Ronkvist et al., 2009).
More recently, HiC has been shown to act synergistically
with Candida antarctica lipase B (CALB) to eﬀectively hydrolyze
PET to TPA (Carniel et al., 2017). Initial screening of 10 lipases
using the PET intermediate bis-(2-hydroxyethyl)-terephthalate
(BHET), revealed that CALB could complete its conversion
to TPA, while HiC was limited by the last reaction step.
When evaluated for PET hydrolysis, HiC displayed signiﬁcant
accumulation of the intermediate MHET, despite showing better
potential for depolymerization of PET. By combining the CALB
enzyme with HiC, PET degradation was shown to be more
complete, resulting in a 7.7-fold increase in TPA yield from PET
(Carniel et al., 2017).
Aspergillus oryzae , C. antarctica , and Penicillium citrinum
are among other fungal enzymes that have been investigated
for activity on PET and are considered most suitable for PET
ﬁber and fabric treatments (Zimmermann and Billig, 2010;
Kawai et al., 2019).
Metagenome-Derived Enzymes
Novel genes from the unculturable fraction of diﬀerent
environmental ecosystems can be accessed using metagenomic
approaches. During a metagenomic study of leaf-branch
compost, a gene with 57.4% sequence identity to Tfu_0883
cutinase from T. fusca was identiﬁed (Sulaiman et al., 2012).
This gene was found to encode LC-cutinase (LCC), a novel
cutinase homolog, following a functional-based screen of a
metagenomic library from the compost using tributyrin agar.
LCC was subsequently heterologously expressed in E. coli and
shown to hydrolyze various fatty acid monoesters optimally at
50◦C, with a preference for short-chain substrates (up to C 4).
This reaction was used to show that the optimal enzymatic
activity for LC-cutinase occurs at 50◦C and pH 8.5. The enzyme’s
speciﬁc activity for p-NPB is comparable to that of the T. fusca
cutinase, although slightly lower. LCC was also capable of
degrading PCL and PET, with the enzyme displaying speciﬁc
PET-degrading activity of 12 mg/h/mg of enzyme at 50 ◦C and
pH 8.0 (Sulaiman et al., 2012).
A dual enzyme system, which combined LC-cutinase with
an immobilized T. fusca KW3 carboxylesterase (EC 3.1.1.1)
called TfCa, was subsequently investigated for its ability to
hydrolyze PET ﬁlms (Barth et al., 2016). Typically, enzymatic
PET degradation is restricted once the MHET intermediate is
formed. The presence of immobilized TfCa was, however, shown
to enable LC-cutinase hydrolysis of inhibitory MHET. HPLC
analysis of degradation products indicated that the LCC-TfCa
dual enzyme system gave a 2.4-fold higher yield of hydrolysates
compared with one that combined TfCa with TfCut2 from
T. fusca . In terms of total amounts of products released with
the LCC-TfCa combination, an increase of 104% was observed
versus PET enzymatic hydrolysis where TfCa was not added
(Barth et al., 2016).
A recent study by the Streit group, involving a search for
PET hydrolase genes across existing marine and terrestrial
metagenomic datasets uncovered over 800 putative PET
hydrolases (Danso et al., 2018, 2019). 13 potential PET homologs
(PET1-PET13) were selected based on their sequence similarity
to previously identiﬁed PET hydrolase enzymes. Of these, four
enzymes, PET2, PET5, PET6, and PET12, were functionally
veriﬁed as novel PET hydrolase candidates, with active clones
giving clearance on PET nanoparticle plates. One of these
enzymes, PET2, which was obtained from marine metagenomic
data, was shown to have a temperature optimum of 70 ◦C and
retained its thermostability up to 90◦C (Danso et al., 2018).
Screening of over 200 puriﬁed, uncharacterized hydrolytic
enzymes from environmental metagenomes and sequenced
microbial genomes was carried out in a recent study to
ﬁnd proteins with strong degradative activity against synthetic
polyesters (Hajighasemi et al., 2018). The selected hydrolase genes
were heterologously expressed in an E. coli host and puriﬁed by a
combination of aﬃnity chromatography and either ion exchange
or size exclusion chromatography. Among the enzymes identiﬁed
were MGS0156 and GEN0105, two metagenomic esterases
capable of hydrolyzing polylactic acid (PLA), polycaprolactone
and a PET model substrate, 3PET. Following determination of its
crystal structure, MGS0156 was found to feature a modiﬁed α/β
hydrolase fold, a highly hydrophobic active site, and a lid domain.
Structure-based mutational studies revealed the key amino acid
residues required for hydrolytic activity, including catalytic triad
residues Ser232, His73, and Asp350, and adjacent residues
His231, Lys233, and Asp372. The side chains of Cys173 and
Cys287 formed a disulﬁde bond which stabilizes an important
protein lid domain. The polyesterase activity of a MGS0156
mutant (L169A) was twice as high as that of the wild-type
(Hajighasemi et al., 2018).
Metagenomic tools have a powerful ability to tap into the
microbial biodiversity of diﬀerent environments. Thus, it is worth
further developing search algorithms that explore metagenomic
datasets for valuable activities as well as establishing consistent
functional assays that can be run in parallel to detect PET
hydrolase enzymes (Danso et al., 2019).
CHALLENGES AND LIMITATIONS
While the area of enzymatic PET hydrolysis is expanding rapidly,
several major challenges remain which will need to be addressed
to further advance the ﬁeld.
Low Prevalence of PET Hydrolysis
Activities
So far, relatively few microbial genera have been described
which possess the ability to degrade PET, with those that do
often only causing partial break down into oligomers (Wei
and Zimmermann, 2017b). Current reports indicate that the
PET degradation trait features in only a limited number of

Carr et al. Microbial PET Hydrolases
FIGURE 3 | System for the identiﬁcation and functional testing of candidate PET hydrolase enzymes. Potential PET hydrolase sequences may be uncovered with an
initial bioinformatic search of existing databases, by employing hidden Markov models. Candidate genes are then cloned into a heterologous host to verify activity
against substrates, e.g., PCL and PET-nanoparticles.
bacterial phyla, with most to date being found in members of the
Actinobacteria (Herrero Acero et al., 2011).
In the aforementioned study targeting novel genes related
to PET hydrolysis in marine and terrestrial metagenomics
datasets, Danso et al. (2018) employed a search algorithm
that detected 504 possible candidate genes from various
databases. In addition, they performed a global search of over
16 Gb of metagenomic sequence data from the Integrated
Microbial Genome (IMG) database, which resulted in the
identiﬁcation of 349 putative PET hydrolases. Both searches
relied on a hidden Markov model and were followed by
functional testing of potential PET hydrolase sequences
(Figure 3 ). PET hydrolase frequencies ranged from 0.004 to
0.92 hits/Mb and 0.0001 to 1.513 hits/Mb for marine and
terrestrial metagenome datasets, respectively. An average
of 157 PET hydrolase homologs were present in terrestrial
metagenomes, compared with an average of 42 homologs
in marine metagenomes. A metagenomic sample from a
crude oil reservoir oﬀered the highest rate of sequence hits
(1.5 hits/Mb). While the phylum Actinobacteria was the main
provider of terrestrial-derived enzymes, many PET hydrolases
predicted from the marine samples were linked to Bacteroidetes
(Danso et al., 2018).
Bacteroidetes species, although not previously associated
with PET hydrolysis, are known to be equipped with multiple
hydrolases and binding molecules for degradation of other
polymers such as xylan, cellulose, and pectin (Dodd et al.,
2011; Thomas et al., 2011). The second most abundant phylum
associated with both datasets was the Proteobacteria, comprising
20 and 30% of hits in the terrestrial and marine data, respectively.
Beta-, Delta-, and Gammaproteobacteria were the main hosts
harboring PET hydrolase genes within this phylum. Since

Carr et al. Microbial PET Hydrolases
over 100 metagenomes were included in the analysis, an
overall picture of the occurrence of PET hydrolase enzymes
was generated. However, this data may not be an accurate
representation of the expression of these genes in the natural
environment. The low gene frequencies observed suggests that
this trait may have only evolved quite recently and may not
have had the opportunity to spread within diﬀerent microbial
populations. Overall, the data suggests that PET hydrolases
are rare enzymes (Danso et al., 2018). Notwithstanding this,
it is also likely that by exploiting global metagenomic data
sets to gain access to dark matter proteins and non-culturable
microbes, that there is potential to increase the diversity
of microbes and enzymes that act on synthetic polymers
(Danso et al., 2019).
Impact of PET Properties on Enzymatic
Activity
The success of PET hydrolysis relies on a balanced combination
of suitable enzyme structure and polymer chain ﬂexibility
(Zumstein et al., 2017). There are a few factors, relating to
the nature of PET, which inﬂuence the extent to which it is
hydrolyzed. PET crystallinity and orientation are among the key
features which may aﬀect the ability of an enzyme to break apart
its building blocks (Webb et al., 2013; Kawai et al., 2019).
As with most polymers, PET is typically comprised of a
complex structure with crystalline regions that feature tightly
packed chains in parallel, and amorphous regions where the
chains are disordered (Demirel et al., 2011; Robertson, 2016).
Depending on the intended use of the ﬁnal product, PET
can have diﬀerent degrees of crystallinity. Generally, PET
employed to make bottles and textiles is associated with having
a high crystallinity of between 30 and 40%. Conversely, PET
which is used to create packaging has lower crystallinities,
for example, PET-GF , a commercially available low-crystallinity
PET ﬁlm, is estimated to have 6–7% crystallinity (Kawai et al.,
2014). Numerous reports indicate that PET hydrolase enzymes
preferentially degrade the regions of PET that are amorphous
in nature ( Figure 4 ) (Welzel et al., 2002; Brueckner et al.,
2008; Ronkvist et al., 2009; Donelli et al., 2010; Gamerith et al.,
2017). As the crystallinity of PET increases, the ﬂexibility and
movement of the polymer chains becomes more restricted,
thus reducing the susceptibility of these chains to enzymatic
attack. In spite of this, it has been suggested that hydrolysis
of amorphous regions may impact on crystalline regions, such
that both can ultimately be digested (Ronkvist et al., 2009;
Kawai et al., 2019). Furthermore, the repeating units of bulky
aromatic terephthalate, which are present in the PET backbone,
restrict polymer chain mobility and therefore, degradability
(Wei and Zimmermann, 2017b).
To achieve the desired form for bottles and textiles, the degree
of orientation is increased by stretching to order the PET polymer
chains (Kawai et al., 2019). PET can also be biaxially oriented
(bo-PET) whereby the plastic undergoes additional stretching in
two directions (Breil, 2013). In both cases, orientation results in
strengthening of the hydrogen bonds between the polymers and
further induces crystallization (Wei and Zimmermann, 2017a).
In addition, crystallinity and orientation during production will
inﬂuence surface topology, as seen in the manufacture of plastic
bottles by injection molding – diﬀerent parts of the bottle
will have diﬀerent surface properties with varying orientations
of polymer chains. While these methods enhance the physical
properties of PET for application, it is very restrictive in terms of
enzymatic degradation and there are currently no PET hydrolases
known to directly digest PET in any of the forms just mentioned
(Kawai et al., 2019).
The temperature range within which a polymeric substrate
changes from a glass-like and rigid state to being soft but not
yet melted, is referred to as the glass transition temperature
(Tg) (Becker and Locascio, 2002). The application of heat
above Tg is typically used to induce crystallization, normally
accompanied by molecular orientation. High crystallinity (and
therefore increased resistance to degradation) is associated with
higher glass transition temperatures, with amorphous PET
having a Tg of 67 ◦C and crystalline PET having a Tg of 81 ◦C
(Groeninckx et al., 1974; Demirel et al., 2011). However, when
PET is in aqueous conditions, Tg values are lowered to 60–
65◦C as a result of the diﬀusion of water molecules between the
polymer chains (Kikkawa et al., 2004; Kawai et al., 2014). This
weakens the associated hydrogen bonds and thereby increases
randomness, ﬂexibility, and mobility of the chains. Enzymatic
reactions are routinely performed in a solution, meaning that
the Tg of PET decreases such that enzymes have increased
accessibility to the polymer chains. Water absorbency of PET
can vary between 0.1 and 1% depending on the form but
will also increase under higher temperatures. Therefore, it is
recommended to set high PET hydrolysis reaction temperatures,
preferably above Tg, as this has been reported to give higher rates
of degradation (Kawai et al., 2014, 2019; Oda et al., 2018). On
the other hand, it is then vital to employ a thermostable PET
hydrolase. Thermostability is generally advantageous as catalysis
is promoted at raised temperatures and allows biocatalysis to
be maintained over a long period at ambient temperatures
(Kawai et al., 2019).
Inhibition of the cutinase enzyme TfCut2 by the intermediate
products of PET degradation has been investigated in a recent
study aiming to identify the bottlenecks in reaching complete
PET hydrolysis (Barth et al., 2015). MHET, BHET, EG, and TPA
are recognized as the main hydrolysis products of PET ﬁlms
and ﬁbers (Vertommen et al., 2005; Brueckner et al., 2008; Eberl
et al., 2009). The experiment involved TfCut2 digestion of a PET
nanoparticle substrate in the presence of these four intermediates,
with their inhibitory eﬀect analyzed using reversed-phase HPLC
and a model for heterogenous enzymatic polymer hydrolysis.
MHET and BHET were shown to competitively inhibit hydrolysis
by occupying the substrate binding site of the TfCut2 enzyme
whereas TPA and EG had no impact on the ability of the enzyme
to degrade the PET nanoparticles (Barth et al., 2015). One way
of overcoming this challenge has been to use other enzymes in
combination with PET hydrolases to improve substrate binding
and catalytic characteristics (Wei et al., 2016; Carniel et al., 2017;
Austin et al., 2018).
When studying and comparing PET hydrolyzing enzymes,
it is important to account for the variability in properties

of diﬀerent PET substrates. While commercial PET-GF ﬁlm
is regularly used and is a suitable standard for comparing
the abilities of PET hydrolases, it has not been employed
across all studies. It is also necessary to consider the chosen
method for detecting and reporting activity, i.e., weight loss,
hydrolysis, etc. In addition, many enzymes, including HiC,
TfH, FsC, and Cut190 have been used in the textiles industry
to achieve more desirable PET ﬁber characteristics and this
requires only surface modiﬁcation and avoids degrading the
inner PET building block. While PET hydrolases may be used
for surface treatments, they are distinct from PET surface-
modifying enzymes. PET hydrolases should signiﬁcantly degrade
the building blocks of PET (by 10% at least) and result in visible
change when observed by scanning electron microscope (SEM)
(Kawai et al., 2019).
More recently, this group further discussed the need for
clariﬁcation when categorizing an enzyme as a PET hydrolase
(Kawai et al., 2020). They have recommended grouping PET
hydrolyzing enzymes into, (1) PET hydrolases and (2) PET
surface-modifying enzymes. They suggest that the only enzymes
which can currently be considered as PET hydrolases are the
following cutinases; HiC, LCC and variants of TfCut2 (Wei et al.,
2016) and Cut190 (Oda et al., 2018). This is based on criteria
for eﬃcient PET degradation, namely thermostability ( >65◦C,
or ideally >75◦C) and the capacity for the open active site
to bind multiple MHET monomers. It follows that mesophilic
IsPETase, despite its structural similarities to these cutinases and
observed hydrolyzing activities at 30 ◦C, should not be regarded
as a PET hydrolase, particularly with respect to application
(Kawai et al., 2020). It was also recently demonstrated that
while amorphous PET supports growth of I. sakaiensis , high
crystallinity PET ﬁlms and bottles do not (unless hcPET is melted
and cooled rapidly to give amorphous plastic) (Wallace et al.,
2020). TfH may still be grouped with PET hydrolases as it was
the ﬁrst enzyme reported for eﬃcient PET hydrolysis and it
is thermophilic.
It is also worth noting that solubilizers and other additives,
which are often mixed into plastics to change their properties,
may interfere with the activity of degradative enzymes and
may also account for some weight loss during enzymatic
digestion due to microbial break down of these chemical
agents (Danso et al., 2019). While this does not usually
apply to PET manufacturing, plasticizers may be used for
some PET products (Hahladakis et al., 2018). A simple and
robust PET powder-based suspension assay was recently used
to quantify product release from PET, but product detection
was shown to depend on choice of analytical technique.
Therefore, it is advisable to use a combined approach. In
this study, a plate reader method (for rapid screening,
measurement of initial rates, and comparative biochemical
studies) was well complemented by reversed-phase HPLC
analysis (for more in-depth information on the aromatic
monomers produced), which oﬀered greater insight and avoided
errors (Bååth et al., 2020).
Although these factors can create diﬃculty in making exact
conclusions regarding the ability of an enzyme to hydrolyze
PET, this is a relatively new ﬁeld of research which should
see greater harmony across diﬀerent studies as it progresses
into the future. In fact, the recommendations provided by
Kawai et al. (2020), for distinguishing PET hydrolases from
other enzymes may be worthy of further consideration in this
area, particularly for comparative purposes when assessing the

Carr et al. Microbial PET Hydrolases
potential of new PET-active enzymes and when considering PET
hydrolases for practical use.
Enzyme Properties, Catalytic Efﬁciency,
and Thermal Stability
So far, the consensus in the area of PET hydrolysis has
been that known PET hydrolase enzymes have low turnover
rates, particularly toward highly crystallized forms of PET
(Wei and Zimmermann, 2017a; Liu et al., 2018; Danso et al.,
2019; Taniguchi et al., 2019). Even IsPETase, which has
shown speciﬁcity for degradation of hc-PET, is considered
to have a relatively low catalytic activity (Taniguchi et al.,
2019). Furthermore, given that reaction temperatures above
the Tg of PET have been advised for more rapid hydrolysis,
candidate enzymes should ideally display high enzymatic
eﬃciency while also retaining activity over 75 ◦C (Yoshida
et al., 2016; Taniguchi et al., 2019). For instance, IsPETase
is heat labile but thermostable cutinases such as LCC, TfH,
and HiC may fall short of IsPETase in terms of speciﬁcity
for PET substrate, demonstrating the need for a combination
of both traits (Wei and Zimmermann, 2017a; Liu et al.,
2018; Taniguchi et al., 2019). Enzyme adsorption, whereby
the protein adheres to the polymer surface, is a key process
in the hydrolysis of PET and other polymers. This binding
results from contact between hydrophobic PET ﬁbers and
any hydrophobic amino acid residues located at the protein
surface (Norde, 1996; Kim and Yoon, 2002; Stuart, 2003;
Palonen et al., 2004; O’Neill et al., 2007). It was mentioned
already that T. cellulosilytica cutinase, Thc_Cut2, displayed lower
hydrolytic eﬃciency compared with Thc_Cut1 that could be
attributed to the individual hydrophobic surface properties of
these enzymes. Subsequently, site-directed mutagenesis was used
to demonstrate that amino acids on the enzyme surface are
important for PET hydrolysis, by exchanging selected Thc_Cut2
residues with those only present on the surface of Thc_Cut1
(Herrero Acero et al., 2013). Another group improved Thc_Cut1
PET hydrolysis through fusion of two hydrophobic binding
domains to enhance the enzyme’s adsorption abilities (Ribitsch
et al., 2013). Also, microbial bioﬁlm production can play an
important role in plastic biodegradation due to the comparably
high hydrophobicity of the associated cell surfaces, which in
turn facilitates their attachment to synthetic polymers. Given
that cell surfaces are usually hydrophilic in nature, attachment
is often enhanced by adding hydrophilic functional groups
to the hydrophobic polymers. This increases access of the
released hydrolytic enzymes to the plastic surface (Orr et al.,
2004; Tribedi and Sil, 2014; Nauendorf et al., 2016; Wilkes
and Aristilde, 2017). Once attachment is initiated, subsequent
degradation steps, such as biodeterioration, biofragmentation,
assimilation, and mineralization can proceed more easily
(Jaiswal et al., 2020).
The area of enzymatic PET hydrolysis may be progressed
either by continuing to mine for new PET hydrolases with
improved eﬃciencies, or through the application of protein
engineering strategies to enhance the characteristics of
enzymes that have already been identiﬁed (Liu et al., 2018).
To date, rational design has proven useful in modifying
cutinase enzymes to improve their activities. For example,
site-directed mutagenesis, has been used to deliver more space
or hydrophobicity in the Tfu_0883 active site (Silva et al., 2011)
and helped to achieve 2.7- and 3-fold increases in activity for
TfCut2 and Thc_Cut2, respectively (Herrero Acero et al., 2013;
Wei et al., 2016).
In a study that focused on six key residues around theIsPETase
substrate-binding pocket, Ma et al. (2018) created and tested
for highly eﬃcient mutants using rational protein engineering.
The selected mutations aimed at optimizing the residues around
the active site by replacing them with smaller amino acids
to create space for the bulky aromatic groups of PET, or by
substituting with more hydrophobic amino acids to give a greater
aﬃnity toward hydrophobic PET. Of the mutants that displayed
improved activities compared to wild-type IsPETase, one variant
(I179F) achieved a 2.5-fold increase in degradation of biaxially
oriented PET ﬁlm (35% crystallinity). This was determined based
on weight loss of ﬁlm after 48 h at 30 ◦C (Ma et al., 2018;
Kawai et al., 2019).
Following structural analysis, (Liu et al., 2018) designed a
series of IsPETase mutants using site directed mutagenesis.
Targets included key residues in the substrate-binding pockets
and those which help stabilize active site rigidity. With mutations
that led to increased aromaticity on the binding pocket edge
or increased space at the binding center, higher activities were
observed over the wild-type enzyme toward PET bottles. Activity
was detected in terms of hydrolysis following 48 h incubation at
30◦C and included a 3.1-fold increase by one mutant (Y87A) (Liu
et al., 2018; Taniguchi et al., 2019).
In another study, a glycosylation strategy was employed to
inhibit LC-cutinase native aggregation (Shirke et al., 2018).
While LCC displays high thermostability ( Tm = 86 ◦C), initial
thermal deactivation testing revealed a high tendency for
aggregation by electrostatic interactions, limiting this enzyme
in terms of stability and therefore, practical application.
Glycosylated LCC (LCC-G), which was produced post-
translationally by engineering three known N-glycosylation sites
and expressing in Pichia pastoris, showed improvements in PET
degradation under optimum temperature and concentration
(Shirke et al., 2018).
Recently, Son et al. (2019) carried out a study to address
the requirement for IsPETase variants with a highly increased
capacity for PET hydrolysis and improved stabilities that
enable the secreted enzyme to maintain its function in
a harsh extracellular environment, over a long period at
moderate temperatures. To achieve this, the group designed
a plan for rational protein engineering based on the existing
crystal structure of IsPETase. Following screening, an IsPETase
(S121E/D186H/R280A) mutant displayed particularly enhanced
characteristics (Son et al., 2019). This variant was designed
such that subsite IIc was extended to provide a non-protruding,
hydrophobic cleft, and a ﬂexible β6–β7 connecting loop
was stabilized (Joo et al., 2018). Upon comparison of the
mutant with wild-type IsPETase, degradative activity toward
PET ﬁlm was shown to be 14-fold higher at 40 ◦C. In
addition, the melting temperature of this variant increased
Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 13 November 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 571265

Carr et al. Microbial PET Hydrolases
by 8.81 ◦C and high thermostability was further veriﬁed by
a heat-inactivation experiment (Son et al., 2019). The same
group have since introduced mutations N246D and S242T,
generating a quadruple IsPETase variant which displayed a 58-
fold increase in hydrolyzing activity over its wild-type at 37 ◦C,
and maintained activity under these conditions for 20 days
(Son et al., 2020).
Previous work demonstrated that the addition of the cation
Ca2+(or Mg2+) had a positive eﬀect on activating and stabilizing
enzymes for PET hydrolysis (Kawai et al., 2014; Sulaiman et al.,
2014; Miyakawa et al., 2015; Then et al., 2015). More recently,
(Oda et al., 2018) investigated the role of three Ca 2+ions bound
to separate sites (1–3) on Cut190 (S226P/R228S) and found that
the ions had diﬀerent roles in thermal and structural stabilization
as well as enzyme activation, generating an overall change in
protein conformation that help increase activity. Furthermore,
by introducing a disulﬁde bond in site 2 for thermostability, the
melting temperature was increased by at least 20–30 ◦C when
mutants were Ca 2+-bound, with the bond mimicking the eﬀect
of Ca2+(Oda et al., 2018).
Another group have demonstrated that pre-incubation of
PET ﬁlm with anionic surfactants attracted cationic IsPETase by
helping to orient the enzyme active site with the hydrophobic
PET surface (Furukawa et al., 2018). This accelerated enzymatic
activity by 120-fold, with a 22% decrease in ﬁlm thickness
following incubation at 30 ◦C for 36 h (Furukawa et al., 2018).
In a follow-on study, they found that the activity of mutant
TfCut2 (G62A/F209A) could be increased by the presence of
a cationic surfactant. In this case, the enzyme has a negatively
charged surface and is therefore brought closer to the PET
ﬁlm via electrostatic interactions upon addition of cationic
surfactant (Furukawa et al., 2019). Moreover, when investigating
the impact of diﬀerent conditions on IsPETase, that may have
relevance for industrial application, Liu et al. (2019) reported
that organic solvents and detergents reduced the enzyme’s
activity, while salts and glycerol led to enhanced enzymatic
activity. Of the salts used, Na 2SO4 had the most positive eﬀect,
which may be due to its higher eﬀective cation concentration
(Liu et al., 2019).
From an industrial perspective, wild-type microbial enzymes
are usually modiﬁed to withstand the harsh and variable
reaction conditions, and to satisfy the catalytic needs of a
given process (Shukla, 2019). A synthetic biology approach
combines a range of molecular and computational tools to
generate enzymes that meet industrial expectations. Microbial
metabolism can be manipulated through engineering of
regulatory and genetic elements (e.g., promoter, terminator,
and binding sequences), to optimize gene expression and
protein production. Nanotechnology is another synthetic
biology tool, that has been used for enzyme immobilization
onto nanoparticle beads. This can lead to improvements in
enzyme activity, stability, and thus reusability, as demonstrated
by an immobilized lipase from a Fusarium incarnatum strain,
which retained 75% of its degradation activity after 5 cycles
when applied to treat waste cooking oil (Joshi et al., 2019).
In silico studies and computer simulations bypass lab-scale
investigations and are used, for example, to investigate
enzyme-substrate interactions and substrate-binding eﬃciency
(Shukla, 2019).
FUTURE PERSPECTIVES
Bioremediation
Bioremediation refers to the use of living organisms or
their enzymes to detoxify or restore contaminated sites,
often by directing the natural capabilities of microbes toward
environmental pollutants (Baba et al., 2016). Microorganisms
have proven valuable in the remediation of environmental
pollutants and various waste substances such as heavy metals
(Kang et al., 2016; Igiri et al., 2018), polychlorinated biphenyls
(PCBs) (Sharma J.K. et al., 2018; Elangovan et al., 2019) and even
petroleum (Varjani, 2017; Koolivand et al., 2019). With respect
to the contamination of marine and terrestrial environments by
plastics, microplastics and their residues, it is vital to establish an
eﬃcient and carefully thought-out bioremediation strategy.
Thermobiﬁda sp., Fusarium sp., Saccharomonospora sp.,
Bacillus sp., and Pseudomonas sp., are among the diﬀerent
microbial species that have to date been reported to degrade PET
(Kumari and Chaudhary, 2020). Members of the Pseudomonas
genus, which are noted for their extraordinary metabolic
versatility, stand out as a natural degraders of synthetic substrates
including diﬀerent types of plastic and plastic associated
monomers (Wierckx et al., 2015). In addition to hydrocarbons
and other hydrophobic polymers, environmental Pseudomonas
isolates have been shown to degrade polyethylene, polyethylene
glycol, polypropylene, polyurethane, polystyrene, polyethylene
succinate, polyvinyl alcohol, and polyvinyl chloride, to varying
extents (Wilkes and Aristilde, 2017; Sharma, 2018). One
microbial consortium, isolated from cow dung, consisting of
thermophilic Pseudomonas sp., Bacillus sp., Paenibacillus sp., and
Stenotrophomonas sp., was demonstrated to reduce the weight of
high density polyethylene (HDPE) and low density polyethylene
(LDPE) by 55 and 77%, respectively, following 120 days
incubation (Skariyachan et al., 2017). Several Pseudomonas spp.,
including Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens ,
Pseudomonas protegens , and Pseudomonas chlororaphis , have
been found to be polyurethane degraders, despite the high
durability of this material (Wilkes and Aristilde, 2017).
Microbes for plastic degradation, especially those which have
been enhanced through genetic engineering, should not be
released into nature without assessing the risk of introducing
foreign microorganisms, that could potentially become invasive.
Moreover, the microbes cannot be expected to simply “seek
out” and degrade plastic in the environment as there are likely
to be other, more easily accessible energy sources that they
can consume (Jenkins et al., 2019). In the case of marine
environments, where plastic waste most commonly accumulates,
microorganisms for bioremediation may not be well adapted
to operate under saltwater conditions. Therefore, the relevant
enzymes may need to be produced in a better suited microbial
cell factory (Moog et al., 2019). Another solution to facilitate
bioremediation of ocean plastic is to use membrane-based
systems featuring immobilized microbes or enzymes for plastic

Carr et al. Microbial PET Hydrolases
degradation. This would provide a “concentrated” source of
plastic for the degradative microbes while also ensuring their
containment (Jenkins et al., 2019).
Microorganisms are generally found living within complex
communities that interact intensively and can adapt their
overall metabolism to eﬃciently exploit the available resources
(Jenkins et al., 2019). The use of a deﬁned but ﬂexible mixed
microbial consortia (MCC) can help extend this concept to
biotechnology processes and oﬀers the advantages of inexpensive
culture preparation and maintenance, reduced susceptibility
to contamination, improved conversion eﬃciencies, and
an alternative to improvement by genetic modiﬁcation.
Biocontainment measures which enable the termination of the
MMC or certain strains, such as passcode or dead-man kill
switches, are required for their use in natural environments
(Jenkins et al., 2019). In this respect the aforementioned
microbial consortium no. 46 from I. sakaiensis , may prove
useful in bioremediation applications, either directly in the
environment or in designated facilities for the treatment of
PET waste and microplastics from marine and terrestrial
sources (Hiraga et al., 2019). However, to fulﬁll the criteria
for eﬃcient bioremediation, natural microbial consortia
require synthetic modiﬁcations to improve consortium
interactions such as cell-cell signaling and metabolite exchange
(Jaiswal et al., 2020).
Extensive research is still required for the bioremediation of
PET-based environmental contamination and even with progress
in this area, challenges will remain due to other types of synthetic
polymers, present as waste in the environment. Although the
potential of current candidates cannot be readily extended to
large-scale bioremediation applications, the exploitation of their
enzymes or metabolic pathways could be achieved through
synthetic biology approaches and systemic biology, which utilizes
multi-omics tools and biodegradation network databases, thus
facilitating bioremediation of a complex substance like plastic
(Jaiswal et al., 2020; Kumari and Chaudhary, 2020).
Biological Recycling
Unlike glass or aluminum, where material can be repeatedly
recovered in its original form, it is diﬃcult to close the loop
on the recycling of plastics. However, PET can to some extent
be recycled using mechanical, chemical, or biological routes.
In mechanical recycling, collected and sorted PET waste can
be shredded and ground into powders before melting and
reprocessing to other forms (Koshti et al., 2018). The resulting
ﬁbers, ﬁlms and sheets cannot, however, be further recycled
and are often incinerated, subsequently contributing to increased
CO2 emissions. Chemical recycling aims to degrade PET into
its basic monomers which can then be repolymerized. This
method is unfavorable from an economic standpoint as the
recovered monomers are more expensive than those from crude
oil and despite its drawbacks, mechanical recycling is much
more cost eﬀective (Awaja and Pavel, 2005; Hiraga et al.,
2019). In addition, chemical methods require the maintenance
of high temperature and pressure as well as employing toxic
reagents and several preceding unit operations (Wei and
Zimmermann, 2017a; Koshti et al., 2018). For both chemical
and mechanical recycling, the temperatures used are usually
over 100 ◦C and often exceed 200 ◦C. Unfortunately, there
are also several contaminants, that signiﬁcantly interfere with
the eﬀectiveness of these PET recycling methods, whether
they arise from other waste collected, the recycling process
itself or misuse by consumers (Awaja and Pavel, 2005; Webb
et al., 2013). Overall, PET recycling remains an expensive and
ineﬃcient process, regardless of the advantages over waste
management via landﬁll and incineration, which are associated
with major environmental drawbacks such as pollution and
atmospheric release of harmful compounds (Zhang et al., 2004;
Webb et al., 2013).
While chemical and mechanical processing of PET are
currently in widespread use, biological recycling is emerging as
a more sustainable solution as it can be performed under mild
pH and comparatively low temperature conditions, without the
use of hazardous chemicals (Awaja and Pavel, 2005; Webb et al.,
2013; Wei and Zimmermann, 2017b). Biological recycling (or
bio-recycling) is based on microbial catalysis of polymer bond
cleavage reactions, which results in the recovery of monomers
that can be subjected to further processing (Koshti et al.,
2018). Bio-recycling holds great potential for improved eﬃciency
and cost eﬀectiveness over the aforementioned mechanical
and chemical methods as well as helping to eliminate the
occurrence of secondary pollutants that come with landﬁll
and incineration (Webb et al., 2013). The possibility exists
that a biological recycling process could be achieved using
PET hydrolysis and further metabolism of its monomers by
I. sakaiensis and other PET-degrading organisms and their
enzymatic systems (Hiraga et al., 2019). However, bio-recycling
is limited by the organism used, inherent polymer properties
and the choice of pre-treatment. The future success of this
process will rely on optimization and/or modiﬁcation of these
factors (Koshti et al., 2018). Given the time and variables
associated with cultivating and maintaining microorganisms as
well as extracting their enzymes and allowing the degradation
reaction to proceed, biological recycling is relatively slow when
compared with chemical or mechanical methods. Therefore, bio-
recycling must currently be carried out in combination with
at least one of these other approaches (Koshti et al., 2018;
Farzi et al., 2019).
In one study, Farzi et al. (2019) assessed the biodegradation of
PET by Streptomyces species in conjunction with a mechanical
strategy. PET waste, in the form of bottles, was ground down
to a powder form prior to the bacterial treatment, which
comprised of 18 days incubation in a culture medium at
28◦C. Powdered PET was separated by particle size (500,
420, 300, and 212 µm) with 50 mg samples of each size
undergoing treatment. Through extraction of residual PET, ﬁnal
biodegradation percentages for the four groups were determined
to be 49.2, 57.4, 62.4, and 68.8%, in order of decreasing particle
size. Metabolites were analyzed via GC-MS (gas chromatography-
mass spectrometry) to detect the hydrolysis products and to
conﬁrm the biodegradation process had taken place. In addition,
a comparison between powdered and ﬁlm sample degradation
was undertaken using a PET ﬁlm made from bottles, that was
then subjected to the same biodegradation treatment, again for

Carr et al. Microbial PET Hydrolases
18 days. Subsequent SEM analysis was used to visualize the
surface of this ﬁlm. While it was shown that degradation of the
ﬁlm surface did occur, results were not signiﬁcant, particularly
when compared to the powdered samples. It was evident
from this lab-scale assessment that a mechanical powdering
treatment can be very eﬀective, giving high degradation eﬃciency
(Farzi et al., 2019).
In another study, which combined bio-recycling with alkaline
hydrolysis, an alkali-resistant whole cell biocatalyst was employed
(Gong et al., 2018). Alkaline hydrolysis is one of several methods
used to achieve PET chemical recycling (Carta et al., 2003;
Koshti et al., 2018). A Comamonas testosteroni F4 strain that
had previously been isolated from the wastewater of a factory
producing PET (Zhang et al., 2004), was shown to degrade
PET ﬁbers and was subsequently subjected to evolutionary
engineering to ﬁrst give C. testosteroni F5, a strain which could
utilize PET as a sole carbon source under alkaline conditions
(Gong et al., 2012). Further modiﬁcations were completed
to obtain the ﬁnal alkali-tolerant strain, C. testosteroni F6.
With whole-cell bacterial degradation of PET, the products
do not accumulate in the culture as they are used during
growth of the strain, thereby circumventing any feedback
inhibition. Micro-sized PET particles ( <10 µm) prepared by
drying and grinding PET were used as the substrate, with no
additional carbon sources. These particles were subjected to a
48 h fermentation at 37 ◦C under three degradation conditions
using: (1) the original F4 strain in a neutral medium; (2) the
engineered F6 strain in an alkaline medium; (3) an alkaline
medium without any bacterial culture. Under alkaline catalysis,
the decomposition products were relatively simple, consisting
mostly of TPA. Conversely, MHET, BHET, TPA, and methyl
acrylate (MA) were the products obtained following degradation
under biocatalytic conditions. The highest quantity of PET
degradation products was observed under alkaline conditions
with C. testosteroni F6, which was greater than the sum of
both products under neutral conditions and alkaline hydrolysis
(Gong et al., 2018).
Eﬃcient biodegradation of highly crystallized PET was
achieved by Chen et al. (2020) using a cell surface display-based
strategy. An IsPETase-displaying yeast whole-cell biocatalyst was
developed to overcome the low enzymatic activity of native
IsPETase toward hc-PET, which limits its potential use in bio-
recycling. Engineered Pichia pastoris yeast cells were constructed
to functionally display IsPETase from a codon-optimized
gene sequence. Endogenous glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)
proteins in the yeast cell wall were selected as anchor proteins,
to which the enzyme could be connected via a ﬂexible linker
sequence (Chen et al., 2020). This strategy aimed to increase
the probability of fully exposing the unique active-site cleft and
substrate binding sites, which are crucial for IsPETase activity
(Austin et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2018). A dramatic improvement
in degradation eﬃciency was observed using this whole-cell
biocatalyst system, with an approximated 36-fold increase in
turnover rate compared with that of puriﬁed IsPETase. The
whole-cell biocatalyst was shown to be robust and reusable, with
the turnover rate remaining stable up to its seventh repeated use
and under certain solvent/chemical conditions. In addition, the
pH and thermostability of the enzyme increased following cell
surface display. This approach presents a promising route for
eﬃcient bio-recycling and coupled with this, there is potential
for activity to be further enhanced through similar cell-surface
display of engineered IsPETase variants (Chen et al., 2020).
The Role of PET Hydrolase Enzymes in a
Circular Bioeconomy
Plastics are currently one of the major challenges in establishing
a circular economy. The aim of a circular economy is to
promote sustainability and eﬃciency by creating loops which
feed resources back into the economy to make the same
or new products. Plastic production is relatively sustainable
when compared with the resource-intensive processes associated
with other materials such as glass and metal. That said,
there is a huge need to re-evaluate plastic design, production,
use and management in order to improve its ability to re-
enter the system and to ensure that maximum value is being
recovered (Hahladakis et al., 2020). Through a combination of
biodegradation and biosynthesis, there is potential for a circular,
bio-based PET economy that could play a signiﬁcant role in
reducing the associated detrimental environmental eﬀects. In
general, the low production cost of plastic has played a major
role in accelerating its mismanagement as reuse does not oﬀer
an economic advantage. While current strategies remain the
most proﬁtable option, a PET bioeconomy could match public
expectations for alternative PET management, which is already
leading to progress in terms of policies and regulations. In
this way, the ﬁnancial gap between strategies could be partially
bridged, enabling an opportunity for further development
of sustainable PET processing and therefore improving the
environmental impact and rates of recycling in the longer term
(Salvador et al., 2019).
In this respect, a strategy for movement toward a circularized
PET economy which employs PET hydrolase enzymes to
establish PET as a biotechnological feedstock has been proposed
(Salvador et al., 2019). Due to the “bow-tie” metabolic
structure associated with microbes, there is great potential for
biodegradation products to be transformed into a range of useful
molecules by channeling the monomers into central metabolism
and linking to relevant biosynthetic pathways. This could be
achieved by using metabolic engineering and synthetic biology to
incorporate PET hydrolase enzymes into a microbial biosynthesis
chassis, thereby helping to create revenue from PET waste
while also reducing its release into the environment (Salvador
et al., 2019; Taniguchi et al., 2019; Blank et al., 2020). Recently,
the photosynthetic microalga Phaeodactylum tricornutum was
employed as a chassis to produce and secrete an engineered
IsPETase which displayed degradative activity toward diﬀerent
PET substrates (Moog et al., 2019). These cell factories could
be valuable in future applications, including the design of
photobioreactors capable of PET biodegradation and synthesis
of new PET from the resulting monomers. To date E. coli and
B. subtilis are among other microbial systems that have been
successfully utilized for the creation of synthetic IsPETase cell
factories (Huang et al., 2018; Moog et al., 2019; Seo et al., 2019).

Carr et al. Microbial PET Hydrolases
Prior to central metabolism, TPA is converted into
protocatechuic acid (PCA) that can be further degraded via
several diﬀerent pathways/routes (Frazee et al., 1993; Maruyama
et al., 2004; Kasai et al., 2009). This is important to consider
when developing PET-based bioprocesses because diﬀerent
pathways will generate a distinct range of metabolites, with
varied applications. For example, PCA itself has been used
to synthesize adipic acid, which is an industrially relevant
metabolite (Johnson et al., 2016; Salvador et al., 2019) and
EG, which can be degraded into acetate or glyoxylate (GLA),
has an even more diverse metabolism than TPA (Child and
Willetts, 1978; Kataoka et al., 2001; Trifunovi ´c et al., 2016).
Signiﬁcantly, EG has been transformed into the bioplastic
polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) by an engineered Pseudomonas
putida KT2440 strain, presenting an opportunity to use PET
monomers as a feedstock for the production of a biodegradable
alternative (Franden et al., 2018; Blank et al., 2020).
Bio-PET, which refers to a PET polymer that is at least partially
derived from biological sources, can be produced through the
microbial synthesis of TPA and EG. By cutting down the
dependence on fossil fuel-derived “virgin” PET, this method
could make a signiﬁcant contribution to a sustainable and circular
PET economy (Salvador et al., 2019). While biosynthesis of
aromatic compounds by microbes has not developed to the same
extent as their degradation, it has been proposed to produce
terephthalic acid by harnessing the shikimate pathway to provide
p-toluate which could be transformed into TPA (Osterhout
et al., 2014). It may also be possible to achieve sustainable TPA
biosynthesis by using aromatics from renewable sources like
lignin. However, many complexities are associated with biological
TPA production and therefore, it is only EG that is currently
produced biologically from renewable feedstocks to give bio-PET
(Salvador et al., 2019). This has been achieved by engineering
artiﬁcial pathways into microorganisms, enabling the use of
renewable plant feedstocks, such as xylose (Cam et al., 2016) and
corn stalk (Pang et al., 2011).
Most recently, the aforementioned LC-cutinase enzyme was
engineered with the aim of maximizing catalysis of PET
depolymerization and was subsequently shown to give 90%
conversion within just 10 h. New PET was successfully
synthesized from the TPA monomers obtained (Tournier et al.,
2020). LCC was demonstrated to outperform four other PET
hydrolytic enzymes, IsPETase, T. fusca hydrolases TfH (BTA-
1) and BTA-2, and F. solani cutinase when compared in terms
of speciﬁc depolymerization rate of pre-treated amorphous
PET ﬁlm at 65 ◦C. Then, following computational identiﬁcation
of amino acid residues for site-saturation mutagenesis, a
range of variants were generated with the aim of introducing
enhanced thermostability and speciﬁc activity toward bottle-
grade PET. Four quadruple variants, ICCG, ICCM, WCCG,
and WCCM, were ultimately selected for further evaluation
(Tournier et al., 2020).
These engineered enzymes were assessed under bioreactor
conditions for degradation of post-consumer colored-ﬂake PET
(PcW-PET) waste. This is the residue that remains once clear
PET waste for mechanical recycling has been removed (Tournier
et al., 2020). PcW-PET was pre-treated using extrusion and
micronization processes that are employed widely in plastics
industries (Awaja and Pavel, 2005; Barboza Neto et al., 2014).
The reaction temperature was set at 72 ◦C to maximize kinetic
turnover. WCCG and ICCG achieved the best conversion levels,
with 85% and 82% conversion within 15 h and 20 h, respectively.
Wild-type LCC reached only 53% conversion in 20 h, owing
to its lower thermostability that rapidly reduces the reaction
kinetics after just 2 h. Following subsequent comparison at 3
milligrams of enzyme per gram of PET, WCCG and ICCG
demonstrated 90% depolymerization after 10.5 h and 9.3 h,
respectively. This was further increased to a 150 L pilot-scale
process using high content of PcW-PET (200 g/kg), which
utilized 2 mgenzyme/gPET in a trade-oﬀ between enzyme cost and
productivity (Tournier et al., 2020).
Initial process development investigated the recycling of
terephthalic acid (TPA) only as this is the main component of
PET by weight, with 1 ton of PET waste leading to 863 kg of
TPA. Terephthalate monomers were puriﬁed to a level exceeding
99.8% through the use of industrially applied methods such
as discoloration by activated carbon and crystallization (Meyer,
1966; Mohammad-Khah and Ansari, 2009). TPA monomers
were used in the synthesis of “virgin” PET, which required
three consecutive steps: esteriﬁcation, polycondensation and
solid-state polymerization. The resulting PET was used to
blow new bottles, which exhibited improved lightness and
similar mechanical characteristics to commercially available
PET bottles, thus creating a closed-loop recycling process
(Tournier et al., 2020).
Biological strategies, even in conjunction with established and
emerging initiatives to curtail plastic pollution, both voluntary
and regulatory, will not meet the current requirements. Instead,
a combination of several diﬀerent multi-tiered approaches
will be essential in eliminating this issue (da Costa et al.,
2020). The matter has been further complicated by the
COVID-19 pandemic, whereby plastic-based personal protective
equipment, such as masks and gloves, along with single-use
plastics due to hygiene concerns and food packaging demands
has resulted in delays in enforcing plastic reduction policies
(Patrício Silva et al., 2020).
Overall, the prospects for establishing a PET circular
bioeconomy are still promising, with several strategies underway
that use PET hydrolytic enzymes (or whole cells) to give TPA
and EG for synthesis of fresh PET or for conversion into
value-added products. Biodegradation-based processes could be
complemented by the sustainable synthesis of TPA and EG
monomers for bio-PET. Some of the potential routes for PET in
the circular economy are summarized (Figure 5).
FINAL REMARKS
While the eﬀorts to harness the power of microbial PET
hydrolase enzymes are ongoing, research in this area has been
encouraging and new knowledge has quickly accumulated.
Many diﬀerent groups have been working to identify and
characterize PET hydrolyzing microorganisms and their enzymes
to explore degradative activities, connect structure with function

Carr et al. Microbial PET Hydrolases
FIGURE 5 | Prospective overview of PET in the circular economy. Monomers resulting from biodegradation of PET may be recovered for manufacture of virgin PET
(biorecycling) or combined with microbially synthesized monomers for a bio-based alternative (biosynthesis). Adipic acid, an important chemical precursor used
primarily in nylon production, and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), which are both bio-based and biodegradable, are among the value-added products that may be
obtained through transformation of TPA and EG monomers (bio-upcycling).
and uncover the mechanisms behind microbial processing of
synthetic polymers. This work, together with the use of powerful
enzyme technologies to create improved variants, has already
improved the feasibility of practical PET degradation and will
continue to underpin future applications as well as process
optimization. Some of the most promising cases highlighted
in this review have included pilot-scale PET hydrolysis using
engineered LC-cutinase together with I. sakaiensis enzymes,
various IsPETase mutants and IsPETase cell factories or display
systems that may enable the break down of high crystallinity
PET under mild reaction conditions. Although enzymatic
systems that resemble the I. sakaiensis PETase-MHETase PET
processing pair have not yet been observed in any other
bacterial genome sequences, the chances of ﬁnding potential
PET metabolic enzymes in the future is likely to increase with
the aforementioned ongoing rapid expansion of genomic and
metagenomic sequence data.
With the aim of addressing diﬀerent types of PET waste,
especially high crystallinity forms, there is a need for further
investigation into strategies such as synergistic combined
enzyme systems, use of ionic surfactants, circumvention of PET
intermediate inhibition and the development of biosynthetic
cell factories. It would also be useful to establish standard
protocols and PET substrates to allow for more meaningful
comparisons when assessing PET hydrolase candidates and
determining optimal process conditions. The development
of microbes and enzymes for biological recycling will help
progress their implementation in other areas, for instance in
bioremediation strategies. Despite the improvements that can be
accomplished using enzyme engineering, “mining” for new PET
hydrolases is still vital to gain a better understanding of plastic
degradation in nature and to identify inherent activities that can
be enhanced to enable treatment of PET waste in situ. Culture
based screening strategies coupled with metagenomic based
approaches targeting various PET or hydrocarbon contaminated
environmental samples is likely to uncover even better evolved
microbial activities for PET metabolism.
In recent years there has been a signiﬁcant shift in awareness
and concern surrounding plastic-related environmental issues.
For the most part, plastic is not inherently “bad, ” with alternative
materials often having a higher overall impact when factors such
as production requirements and bulk shipping are considered.
Plastic packaging also provides the current best solution in
niche sectors, for example, in helping prevent food spoilage in
the food industry. Today’s plastic problem is rooted in a loss
of control and the inability of waste collection, disposal, and
recycling infrastructure to match the pace of the plastics industry.
Therefore, a multi-faceted approach is essential in addressing
the complexities of this issue. In the context of contributing
microbial based solutions, there must be a balance between
process optimization and environmental consequences, such that
counterproductivity is avoided. A collaborative eﬀort is needed
to reimagine the life cycle of PET, where its value is maximized,
and it is treated as a feedstock rather than as a waste product

after use. The development of systems which employ microbes for
PET biodegradation and biosynthesis hold the potential to fulﬁll
these requirements, at least partially. This shift from a linear to
circularized system of PET production and processing could help
meet public demands by reducing the need to “tap into” fossil fuel
reserves and incentivizing better handling of PET waste.
This review serves as an important reminder to other
researchers in this ﬁeld, and to the wider scientiﬁc community,
of the numerous PET hydrolase studies that have been carried
out to date, with an emphasis on the most recent examples and
advances. By highlighting the major challenges in studying and
implementing enzymes for PET degradation, a clearer consensus
can be developed to guide future work. Plastic pollution has
become a global concern, and the interest in sustainable change
is shared by the general public, environmental organizations, and
by governments and industrial leaders. Therefore, it is hoped that
the diﬀerent perspectives presented in this review will play a role
in helping to encourage a more multi-disciplinary approach to
address the ongoing problem of plastic waste streams.
