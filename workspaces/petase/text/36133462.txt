Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is responsible for a large amount of
environmental contamination with microplastics. Based on its high
aﬃnity, the PET degrading enzyme PETase can be immobilized on
superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles through a His-tag. The
His-tag increases enzyme stability, and allows magnetic separation for
recovery. Multiple recycling steps are possible and microplastic
particles can be decomposed depending on the PET's crystallinity. The
separation or decomposition of PET allows for a sustainable way to
remove microplastic from water.
Introduction
Steadily increasing amounts of microplastic particles in the
environment represent a burden for biological organisms
worldwide.
1 The size of these particles ranges between nano-
meters and micrometers up to 5 mm. These microparticles
made of plastics are referred to as microplastics (MP).2,3 Due to
their chemical stability, MPs can last for a long time in the
environment. In the case of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), it
can be up to 450 years.
4 Aside from tire wear, which causes 28%
of the MPs pollution, the clothing industry accounts for the
highest microplastic emissions.
5 During washing processes,
many bers from polyester clothes are released into the oceans
through wastewater. These bers make up about 35% of the
microplastic pollution worldwide. 5,6 Apart from polyester
clothes, PET is mainly used as a raw material in drinking bottle
manufacturing.
7 Furthermore, oven-ready metal trays, cable
lining, and other household products, such as toothpastes,
scrubs, shampoos, and body cleanser can be manufactured
from PET and lead to the emission of microplastics.
8 In the case
of aerial uptake, MPs can act as carriers for pathogens or other
chemical substances which suggest a potential health risk.9–11 In
general, particles smaller than 10 mm are considered more
problematic as they can diﬀuse directly into the lungs and cause
inammation.12 However, there is little research and therefore
missing knowledge on health consequences regarding MP.12–14
Strong acids and bases can hydrolyze PET, which also aﬀects
the crystallinity of the material.15 Chemical recycling of PET is
possible by solvolysis and pyrolysis. 16–18 However, these
methods of recycling lead to the generation of pollutants, and
therefore, more environmentally friendly methods are
needed.
19,20 Several microorganisms possess the ability to
decompose PET into its monomers terephthalic acid (TPA) and
ethylene glycol (EG).
7,21,22 The PET degrading cutinase from
Ideonella sakaiensis, is so far known as the most eﬃcient cuti-
nase operating at room temperature, which decomposes PET to
EG and TPA.
4,21,23,24 Several factors such as temperature, pH and
ionic strength in uence enzymatic activity of PETase. 21,25
Enzymes derived from Ideonella sakaiensis have been tested
towards homogeneous substrate materials such as PET bottle
walls or lms.
26,27 The crystallinity of PET is an important
parameter directly inuencing enzymatic activity.21,26
The immobilization of enzymes on solid carriers is a possi-
bility to overcome the challenges of protein production and
recycling.
28 One objective of immobilization is increasing the
enzyme's stability against environmental impacts such as
temperature or pH changes while keeping the highest possible
catalytic activity of the enzyme and eventually allowing for
a more eﬀective process handling and enzyme reuse.
29,30 There
are diﬀerent kinds of immobilization techniques depending on
the interaction mechanisms between carrier and enzymes.
Conventional interactions include covalent and non-covalent
adsorption and deposition, ionic interaction, cross-linking,
encapsulation in gels and bio-conjugation.
29,31 While all
methods have their advantages and disadvantages, the directed
immobilization via a selective peptide tag seems most
appealing.
32 As an enzyme carrier, magnetic nanoparticles
(MNPs) stand out by their chemical, physical and especially
superparamagnetic properties.

allow to separate MNPs from their surrounding medium by
inducing a magnetic eld. Another advantage of nanoscale
carriers is the large speci c surface area and low steric
hindrance compared to porous materials.35 Furthermore, the
manufacturing of iron oxide nanoparticles is comparatively
cost-eﬃcient
35 and they are generally recognized as safe
(GRAS).36 Hence, they are a suitable solid carrier material for
enzymatic immobilization purposes.32,37,38 Our objective was to
create a novel nano-biocatalyst (NBC) with iron oxide nano-
particles as solid material carriers and the PET degrading
PETase on its surface. To this end, we employed the aﬃnity of
the known histidine tag for MNPs to immobilize the enzyme
PETaseS238F/W159H.
39 Furthermore, we analyzed in detail the
crystallinity change induced by enzymatic degradation of
a powder-like PET substrate. The here presented NBC system is
supposed to combine immobilization advantages, such as
increasing durability and stability, with a still remanent high
enzymatic activity compared to the pure enzyme. In addition,
the magnetic separation feature of magnetic nanoparticles
allows for a high separability and recyclability grade for
a straightforward process handling.
Results and discussion
Magnetic iron oxide nanoparticles used for these experiments
are based on a synthesis route derived from Massart
40 and have
been characterized by Thomas et al.41 In short, the nano-
particles have a primary particle diameter of 10 nm. The
nanoparticles are superparamagnetic with a high saturation
magnetization of 84 A m kg
/C01, consist mainly of magnetite, and
are uncharged at neutral pH.41 All experiments conducted in
this study are described in the experimental section in the ESI.†
The PETase puried with immobilized metal aﬃnity chroma-
tography (IMAC) to a purity of 80% (Fig. S1†) is used for the
immobilization and mixed with the MNPs in diﬀerent concen-
tration ratios (Fig. 1b). The adsorption isotherm yields aKD
value of 0.075 g L/C01 as a measure for the aﬃnity of the His-
tagged proteins to the nanoparticles (Fig. 1a and b). This
dissociation constant indicates a high aﬃnity and is in a similar
range as binding aﬃnities observed for His-tagged proteins on
MNPs.39 Histidine based tags bind through the imidazole group
to the iron oxide surface which can be especially observed by
changes in the ring vibrations at 1199 and 1140 cm
/C01 upon
adsorption of His6 peptides (Fig. S2†).42 An adaptation of the
histidine coordination can also be observed by the binding of
a fusion protein containing a histidine based tag (Fig. S3†).32,43
The bands at 1199, 1140 and 1050 cm/C01 corresponding to ring
vibrations signicantly decrease which indicates an interaction
with the iron oxide surface.44 The aﬃnity is only slightly lower
than the aﬃnity of the novel immobilization tag presented by
Zanker et al. for a comparable enzyme system.32 However, the
aﬃnity is signicantly higher than the aﬃnity of nonspecically
adsorbed enzymes to iron oxide nanoparticles. 37,38 The
maximum binding capacity is at 0.47 g g /C01 which can be
extrapolated from the Langmuir t in Fig. 1b. The binding
capacity of this enzyme is even slightly higher than the one
observed by Zanker et al.
32 but is similarly restricted to the
amount of binding sites on the particle surface, which is
dependent on the particle aggregation.45,46 Thus, a commer-
cially available His-tag allows for the immobilization of
enzymes on bare iron oxide nanoparticles with a high specic
binding aﬃnity. The particles aggregate at neutral pH, which
was observed optically during the binding and separation
process, makes a magnetic separation possible.
45
This behavior is usually enhanced by the presence of
proteins in solution. 45,47,48 Here, a distinct increase in the
particle number distribution to higher hydrodynamic diameters
could be observed with increasing amounts of bound enzyme
(Fig. 1c). Bare nanoparticles demonstrate a bimodal distribu-
tion with a high amount of dispersed particles around 20 nm
which corresponds to the primary particle size of 10 nm
(Fig. 1c).
41 However, aggregates between 250 and 1000 nm were
already visible for bare particles in Tris buﬀer at pH 7.5.
With increasing protein load, another fraction appeared at
around 60–70 nm while the smaller fraction at 20 nm decreased.
This behavior was already observed by Rothet al. and can be
attributed to the protein corona forming around the bare
nanoparticles.
38,49 However, the increasing particle size distri-
bution can also be an aggregation e ﬀect. With further
increasing protein load, the smallest fraction disappeared while
a fraction between 50 and 200 nm could be observed and the
intensity of larger colloids between 200 and 1000 nm is
increasing. This behavior has been observed for proteins bound
to iron oxide nanoparticles with other aﬃnity tags as well.
45 The
stability of small colloid fractions is destabilized by the pres-
ence of proteins and therefore the nanoparticles tend to
aggregate and include the enzymes. However, this dynamic
aggregation is usually reversible and does not signi cantly
aﬀect the enzymatic activity.
38 Furthermore, the colloidal
instability improves the recovery and therefore minimizes the
loss of magnetic nanoparticles during a separation process with
an applied magneticeld.37 The challenge is to combine these
benecial properties of a colloidal unstable system with the
accessibility and the mass transfer properties of colloidal stable
nanoparticles.
To demonstrate the advantages of the PETase immobiliza-
tion on MNPs, we tested the reuse of the immobilized enzymes
for diﬀerent storage times up to two weeks at 4
/C14C and for the
recycling with magnetic separation. Recycling the immobilized
enzyme by magnetic separation is an up-and-coming concept.
Aer ten cycles, still a high enzymatic activity of immobilized
PETase was detectable (Fig. 1e). The highuctuations can be
explained as consequence of aggregation and deagglomeration
eﬀects with and without the magneticeld applied. Aer the
particles settled down, the formation of agglomerates started
again hindering enzymatic performance. Aer the fourth cycle,
the relative specic activity of the NBCsuctuates between 45–
60% for the non-washed NBCs. Similar values can be observed
for uncoated MNPs as carrier material for cellulose
37,50 or ene-
reductase.32
To analyze the inuence of a static storage (4/C14C) on the
activity of the immobilized enzyme, we determined the relative
specic activity aer storing the NBCs for diﬀerent time spans
up to two weeks at 4
/C14C (Fig. 1f). The relative specic activity

Nanoscale Advances Communication
ranges between 40% and 70% but no trend to lower activities
with storage time can be observed. This decrease in the specic
activity may be caused by a possible instability of the PETase.51
Electrostatic interactions between the enzymes themselves can
lead to a conformity change impeding the enzymatic activity. No
degeneration or adsorption of 4-nitrophenol (pNP) was moni-
tored for the blank MNP samples. We want to emphasize that 4-
nitrophenol is only a common model system for PETase which
has diﬀerent requirements for the accessibility and mass
transport than a larger microplastic particle.
24,52 Not only the
enzymatic degradation, but also the magnetic separation of
microplastics is possible.
53,54 Up to 70 g PET could be bound to
1 g MNP while a separation in a magneticeld was still possible
(Fig. 1d). The magnetophoretic force on the MNP-PET
complexes should be quite low in magneticelds of around
100 mT which corresponds to the used NdFeB magnets.
However, the magnetophoretic force is still suﬃcient to sepa-
rate the complexes magnetically.
While pNP assays to measure the enzymatic activity of
enzymes have advantageous characteristics such as the simple
handling and easy adaptability, enzymes and NBCs need to be
evaluated towards their ability to degrade MPs. We investigated
the release of PET degradation products with UV/Vis spectros-
copy in order to estimate the enzymatic activity towards PET-
based substrates. NBCs showed an enzyme activity of around
0.7 mmol g
/C01 h/C01 (Fig. 2b) which is in good agreement with the
measured activity in literature.21 The release of TPA and there-
fore the enzymatic activity of NBCs was even higher than the
one obtained with the free enzyme. This degradation of a PET
substrate makes a strong case for the usage of NBCs to degrade
MP.
With NBCs, not only the enzymatic activity but also the mass
transport is important. How can an NBC enzymatically attack
a semi-crystalline material? In this context, we studied the
properties of MPs before and aer partial enzymatic degrada-
tion. The crystallinity of PET can be analyzed with Raman
spectroscopy. Peaks at 1119 cm
/C01 and 1096 cm/C01 refer to the
C–O–C stretching modes. We compared several PET sources
towards their crystallinity with Raman spectroscopy and DSC
(Fig. S4–S7†). Most PET sources showed a crystallinity between
5–30% with the granulate and powder showing the lowest
crystallinity Fig. S4.† 55,56 The same trend is visible from the
comparison of the C–O–C stretching modes with Raman spec-
troscopy (Fig. S7†). The hard plastic PET bottles show the
highest degree of crystallinity (DOC) followed by the so bottles
and the PETlm. The same trend can be observed from DSC
results as well as from Raman spectroscopy analysis of C–O–C
vibrations. The change of crystallinity was monitored over three
diﬀerent incubation times (Fig. 2c). A slight increase in the
crystallinity of the PET samples by the addition of buﬀer only or
MNPs can be derived from DSC. A signicant increase of the
DOC can be observed aer incubation of PET with NBCs and

free enzymes. Longer incubation times led to higher crystal-
linities, which means less crystalline PET can be degraded faster
than crystalline compartments. Furthermore, the presence of
NBCs led to higher crystallinities than free enzymes. This
behavior might be due to the more limited access of the NBCs to
the PET substrate compared to the free enzyme. The results are
in good agreement with other PET degradation experiments by
free PETase
52 and this is also known to occur with other
substrate enzyme systems such as wheat straw and cellulose
where steric hindrance challenges enzymatic activity (Fig. 2a).
57
Nevertheless, magnetic nanoparticles can be used as carriers for
PETase which allow for a fast degradation of PET and the
recycling of enzymes.
Conclusions
We revealed a promising site-directed immobilization strategy
for PETase on bare magnetic nanoparticlesvia a His-tag. The
immobilization of PETase (PETaseS238F/W159H)
52 on iron
oxide nanoparticles can be realized with high enzyme loads of
up to 0.47 g g/C01 and high aﬃnity. These nanobiocatalysts (NBC)
can be recycled magnetically and maintain around 50% of their
initial enzymatic activity aer 10 cycles. The NBCs can be
magnetically separated with relatively small losses and are able
to degrade PET substrates. We observed a crystallinity increase
of 15% aer 42 hours of incubation with these NBCs at room
temperature. Here, the NBCs led to higher crystalline micro-
particles than the free enzymes which can be accounted to the
limited access and the higher activity. Furthermore, it could be
shown that the NBC outperformed a comparable free PETase
solution aer 42 h in the context of PET microparticle decom-
position. Besides, magnetic nanoparticles have a high magnetic
shing potential of the MNPs towards PET and are able to carry
/C2470 times their own mass of GF-PET. This work paves the way
for new strategies for microplastic reduction based on MP-
degrading enzymes immobilized on magnetic nanocarriers.
