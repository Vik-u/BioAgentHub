Recently developed enzymes for the depolymerization of polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
such as FAST-PETase and LCC-ICCG are inhibited by the intermediate PET product mono(2-
hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET). Consequently, the conversion of PET enzymatically into
its constituent monomers terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG) is inefﬁcient. In
this study, a protein scaffold (1TQH) corresponding to a thermophilic carboxylesterase
(Est30) was selected from the structural database and redesigned in silico. Among designs, a
double variant KL-MHETase (I171K/G130L) with a similar protein melting temperature
(67.58 °C) to that of the PET hydrolase FAST-PETase (67.80 °C) exhibited a 67-fold higher
activity for MHET hydrolysis than FAST-PETase. A fused dual enzyme system comprising KL-
MHETase and FAST-PETase exhibited a 2.6-fold faster PET depolymerization rate than FAST-
PETase alone. Synergy increased the yield of TPA by 1.64 fold, and its purity in the released
aromatic products reached 99.5%. In large reaction systems with 100 g/L substrate con-
centrations, the dual enzyme system KL36F achieved over 90% PET depolymerization into
monomers, demonstrating its potential applicability in the industrial recycling of PET plastics.
Therefore, a dual enzyme system can greatly reduce the reaction and separation cost for
sustainable enzymatic PET recycling.

ynthetic polymers deliver numerous bene ﬁts to human
society, and plastics have emerged as essential materials for
almost every aspect of life. Poly(ethylene terephthalate)
(PET) is one of the most widely used synthetic plastics, and over
82 million metric tons are produced globally
1. However, the
degradation of PET is very slow owing to its chemical recalci-
trance with regard to abiotic and biological breakdown2. Conse-
quently, it accumulates in both landﬁlls and the environment. It
therefore causes serious damage to the global ecosystem and
intensiﬁes demand for a circular plastic economy3. Conventional
chemical recycling methods, such as glycolysis4,5, hydrolysis6,7,
alcoholysis8,9, and aminolysis10, require high temperatures and
pressures, toxic catalysts, and hazardous chemicals. Chemical
treatment methods introduce numerous unknown impurities that
are difﬁcult to eliminate, which increases industrial production
costs1. Enzymatic depolymerization is an attractive and envir-
onmentally friendly alternative method for PET waste recycling
because it can be carried out under mild conditions in an aqueous
solvent, and therefore complies with the concept of sustainability.
Recently developed PET hydrolases such as LCC-ICCG11 can
achieve 90% PET conversion on an industrial scale. The excep-
tional selectivity and mild reaction conditions of enzymatic cat-
alysis can be applied to the exclusive depolymerization of the PET
in plastic waste into its constituent monomers terephthalic acid
(TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG). This greatly reduces processing
costs. However, the current problem with the industrial enzy-
matic recycling of PET is its relatively high cost compared with
virgin PET manufacturing1. The PET hydrolases LCC-ICCG and
FAST-PETase12 can quickly depolymerize PET polymers into the
short intermediate products bis-2-hydroxyethyl terephthalate
(BHET) and mono-hydroxyethyl terephthalate (MHET). How-
ever, the catalytic efﬁciencies of PET hydrolases with regard to the
hydrolysis of MHET into the terminal products TPA and EG are
moderate13–15. The active sites of PET hydrolases are amenable to
hydrophobic polymers or short oligo-ethylene terephthalate
molecule substrates 16,17, and always hydrophobic. But, the
MHET intermediate tends to bind tightly to the PET-degrading
enzyme in a non-catalytically pose. This results in inhibition of
the PET-degrading enzymes and low catalytic ef ﬁciency with
regard to MHET hydrolysis. Therefore, a highly efﬁcient MHET
hydrolase is needed for the industrial depolymerization of PET
into its pure constituent monomers TPA and EG.
MHET is the major intermediate product of PET degradation
(Fig. 1a). However, it inhibits PET hydrolases
13,14,18,19, resulting
in low TPA yield and poor PET conversion efﬁciency. Multi-
enzyme systems can promote the substrate channel and proxi-
mity effect between enzymes. This greatly reduce the diffusion
restriction between the active centers of the enzymes, thereby
promoting enzyme synergy and improving catalytic
efﬁciency20,21. In 2016, Yoshida et al. 22 isolated a bacterium
(Ideonella sakaiensis 201-F6) that uses PET plastic as a carbon
source. This bacterium secretes two enzymes for PET degrada-
tion: a PET hydrolase (PETase) and a MHET hydrolase (MHE-
Tase). This natural synergistic dual enzyme system efﬁciently
degrades PET into its constituent monomers, i.e., TPA and EG, at
30 °C (Fig.1a). Knott et al.23 covalently connected MHETase to
the N-terminus of PETase via Gly-Ser linkers to construct a
fusion enzyme. That fusion enzyme produced approximately six-
fold more degradation products from a PETﬁlm in 96 h at 30 °C
than the single PETase. The glass transition temperature (Tg)o f
bulk amorphous PET polymers is in the range of 65–71 °C24.
When the reaction temperature approachesTg, the amorphous
PET polymer structure transitions from a glassy state to a rubbery
state25, which helps the active sites of PET hydrolases contact
more ester bonds in the polymer substrate24. Therefore, high
temperatures approaching the Tg of PET are necessary for its
degradation24, and great progress has been made to enhance the
thermostability of PETase 3,16,17,26–36. Recently, guided by
machine learning, a PETase variant with ﬁve point mutations
termed FAST-PETase 12 has been engineered to ef ﬁciently
degrade a wide range of post-consumer PET plastics at an opti-
mal temperature of 50 °C. The activity of this enzyme exceeds the
activities of other engineered alternatives11,26,29. However, there
is no report of a thermostable MHETase to match this PET
hydrolase at 50 °C (Table S1).
Various efforts have been made to ﬁnd appropriate MHET
hydrolases to engineer dual enzyme systems that remove the
intermediate product MHET21,23,37–40. The removal of MHET
improves the collective efﬁciency of PET depolymerization and
promotes the TPA yield. Mrigwani et al.39 constructed a dual
enzyme system comprising Thermus thermophilus carbox-
ylesterase (TTCE) and leaf-branch compost cutinase (LCC),
which is a PET hydrolase. The system produced a 30% higher
pure TPA yield from the degradation of PETﬁlms at 60 °C than
LCC alone. Haugwitz et al.40 added the engineered TfCa mutant
WA to PETase PM, and the resulting system achieved an 11-fold
TPA yield from the degradation of an amorphous PET ﬁlm
compared with the single PETase PM at 45 °C over 24 h. How-
ever, although they are thermostable, these MHET hydrolases
always confer low MHET degradation activity, and are therefore
incompatible with proﬁcient and thermostable PET hydrolases,
unless used in excess. Therefore, it is necessary to develop efﬁ-
cient thermostable MHET hydrolases to engineer viable dual
enzyme systems for industrial PET recycling.
Recently, a structure-based computational method has been
used to design new enzymes for various applications 41–52.
Computational enzyme design uses virtual screening; it can sig-
niﬁcantly reduce laboratory work and greatly shorten the devel-
opment cycle required for new enzymes, in contrast to directed
evolution technology50,53. In the present research, we used our
computational enzyme design tool PRODA54–58, in combination
with high-throughput molecular dynamics simulation 51,59–62
(Fig. S1), to generate efﬁcient enzymes for MHET hydrolysis at
the optimal temperatures required for the PET hydrolase FAST-
PETase. An active site model for MHET hydrolysis was developed
based on the catalytic mechanism of the serine hydrolases, which
catalyze a two-step reaction involving the formation of an acyl-
enzyme intermediate (acylation) that is released hydrolytically in
the second step (deacylation)63. During acylation, the key cata-
lytic serine is deprotonated by His, activating the hydroxyl oxygen
of Ser for nucleophilic attack on the carbonyl C of MHET, which
releases EG and forms the acyl-enzyme intermediate
(Fig. 1b)64,65. During the deacylation step, the ester carbon of the
acyl-enzyme intermediate is nucleophilically attacked by a water
molecule. His plays a similar role as in acylation, deprotonating
the catalytic water and transferring the proton to the serine, then
activating the release of TPA64,65. Based on the above mechanism,
we constructed an active site model for obtaining efﬁcient MHET
hydrolases by PRODA. The designed MHET hydrolases were
fused with the PET hydrolase FAST-PETase with the aid of the
protein structure prediction tool AlphaFold66,67 to engineer a
dual enzyme system for PET depolymerization. The dual enzyme
system exhibited higher PET conversion rates and TPA yields
than the single enzyme system.

oxyanion of the transition state (TS) of MHET (Fig.2a). Alanine
is selected in the minimal active site model because it can be
replaced by other amino acids except for proline. A serine pro-
vides a hydrogen bond to the carboxyl group of the TS to facil-
itate its binding. The catalytic geometrical relationships between
catalytic residues and the transition state for active-site matching
are shown in Table S3. The distance and angle parameters are
determined based on the crystal structures of natural MHETase
(PDB ID: 6QGA64 and 6JTT68), and the complex structures of
serine proteases and their transition state analogs69.
To ﬁnd a suitable protein scaffold to accommodate the active
site for MHET hydrolysis at high temperatures, our active site
matching algorithm, ProdaMatch 54,57,58, was used to select
scaffolds from a thermophilic scaffold library owing to its natural
backbone stability advantage 70. The thermostable hydrolase
library consisted of a total of 104 enzyme entries (Table S2),
which were collected from the Protein Data Bank (PDB)
according to the following criteria: (i) can be expressed in E.
coli; (ii) have a high-resolution crystal structure; and (iii)
appropriate sequence length. More details are provided in the
method section. As a result, a total of 32 matches were identiﬁed
in 8 unique scaffolds. Based on the reported optimal temperatures
and the match scores of these 8 scaffolds (Fig.2g and Table S4), 5
top-ranked thermostable scaffolds (1EVQ, 1TQH, 5FRD, 4UHF,
and 2C7B) were screened out for the experimental test. The
superposition of the 5 matched results with their crystal
structures is shown in Fig.2b–f. The calculated transition state
geometries of the catalytic triad and oxyanion hole residues in
5 scaffolds almost overlapped with those in the crystal structures,
where the root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) of the catalytic
triads (i.e., 1TQH: 0.663 Å; 1EVQ: 0.666 Å; 5FRD: 0.154 Å;
4UHF: 0.162 Å; and 2C7B: 0.217 Å) reached sub-angstrom

accuracies and all hydrogen bonding distances in the matched
geometries were within 2–4 Å of each other (Fig. 2b–f). This
suggests that these 5 scaffolds are able to accommodate the
constructed active site model while maintaining perfect catalytic
geometric constraints and possibly afford MHET degradation
activity. All these ﬁve scaffolds were expressible, and two
scaffolds, i.e., 1EVQ and 1TQH, exhibited apparent activity with
regard to MHET hydrolysis (Fig.2h). Their activities were 1.27
and 1.33 times higher than that of the FAST-PETase (Fig.2h).
The experimentally measured activities of scaffolds 1EVQ and
1TQH were consistent with their matching scores (Fig.2g), and
they had the lowest penalty scores among all the test scaffolds.
Moreover, the 1TQH scaffold had almost no activity with regard
to PET degradation compared with 1EVQ (Fig.2i), whose PET
degradation activity reached only 1/7 that of FAST-PETase,
indicating that the 1TQH scaffold conferred higher speciﬁcity
with regard to the hydrolysis of MHET. Therefore, the 1TQH
scaffold was selected for further redesign.

Est3071. To obtain variants with increased activity with regard to
MHET hydrolysis, it was necessary to redesign the active site of
Est30 to stabilize the TS conformation of MHET in the acylation
step. The TS conformation of MHET formed a tetrahedral
intermediate (TI) and was used to establish a computational
model (Fig. 1b, TI1 (the ﬁrst tetrahedral intermediate)) for the
redesign of Est30. A rotamer library of the TS with 946 con-
formers was generated following the placing rules (Table S5) and
the catalytic geometrical constraints (Table S6) using the targeted
small molecule placement approach developed in our earlier
work55,72. That approach accurately represented the translational,
rotational, and conformational freedoms of the TS in the active
site of Est30. The computed binding geometry (Fig.3b) of the TS
in wild-type (WT) Est30 showed that the substrate MHET was
exposed on the outside of the pocket, with aliphatic residues I171,
M127, and L167 surrounding the carboxylic group of MHET. The
carboxyl terminus of MHET formed a weak salt bridge with K122
(Fig. 3b, the H-bond distance was 3.0 Å and the angle was
unfavorable). Our redesign strategy was to stabilize the catalyti-
cally productive conformation of the TS by constructing a
hydrogen bonding network to tightly bind the carboxyl terminus
of the TS and enhance the hydrophobic environment surround-
ing the benzene ring of MHET. In total 26 residues in the 10 Å
range around the substrate MHET were selected as design sites.
The design scheme is shown in Table S7 and the locations of
design sites is shown in Fig. S2, where the amino acids at
8 sequence change positions (T26, K122, M127, G130, L167, I171,
M195, and I196) were varied among (AILMFWYVCSTKHRNQ).
In addition, 18 positions, including 5 catalytic residues (catalytic
triads S94/H223/D193, and oxyanion holes F25/L95) and those
surrounding the active site, were subjected to side-chain con-
formational optimization. Figure 3a shows the geometric con-
straints between catalytic residues and substrate in the TS state
and the positions of the redesigned sites relative to the substrate.
Using our computational enzyme design tool PRODA56, a total of
704 sequences, containing 104 single, 400 double, and 200 triple
mutant sequences were generated, and ranked according to the
energies of the enzyme–TS complex system (Tables S8–10). More
than 70% of the sequences (512/704) had a lower binding energy
than the WT. Here, PRODA was used to identify a small set (704)
of variants corresponding to the global or near global minimum
energy conformations on the energy landscape from the huge
sequence space (20 8). The representative mutations, I171R,
I171K, and M127S, which introduced additional hydrogen
bonding with the carboxyl terminus of MHET, and mutations
G130L and G130F, which enhanced hydrophobic stacking with
the benzene ring of MHET, are shown in Fig.3c–f. To identify a
number of tractable sequences for the experimental test, high-
throughput molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were invoked
to eliminate potential false-positive sequences which refer to
computational sequences that are judged to be more active than
the design template by the calculated free energies but fail in
experiments.
Based on the selection criteria, a total of 237 sequences were
further virtually screened through two rounds of high-throughput
MD simulations. The selection criteria were: (i) the calculated

diversity of mutations (Fig. S4); and (iii) inspection of the

evaluate the sequences produced by PRODA to eliminate the
potentially false positive predictions. Four catalytic indicators
(deﬁned in Table S11, Fig. S3) were developed based on the
catalytic mechanism of serine hydrolases 63,65, including the
RMSD of the TS, the distance of the nucleophilic attack, and
the strength of the two oxyanion hole hydrogen bonds. The
catalytic indicators were used to monitor the massive and high-
dimensional MD simulation data for all 237 selected sequences
and the WT Est30 (Fig.4). The four catalytic indicators calculated
based on 10 × 1 ns (10 independent 1 ns) MD simulations for
237 sequences are presented in Fig. 4a, b. In total, there were
118 sequences in the intersection set of the ﬁrst quadrant of
Fig. 4a and the ﬁrst quadrant of Fig. 4b, which implies
simultaneous improvement of the four catalytic indicators
compared with the WT. Therefore, these sequences were selected
for further validation by using longer MD simulation. The four
catalytic indicators calculated based on 5 × 5 ns (5 independent
5 ns) MD simulations for 118 sequences are presented in
Fig. 4c, d. Most of the sequences (94/118) produced simultaneous
improvement compared with the WT according to the four
catalytic indicators. This states that 60% (143) of the sequences
produced by PRODA calculation (247) were identi ﬁed as
potential false positive sequences by the high-throughput MD
simulations and eliminated. Finally, considering both the PRODA
calculations and the MD simulations, a total of 14 variants were
selected for experimental assessment according to the following
ranking criteria: (i) a lower calculated binding energy change
ΔΔGbind and a lower folding energy change ΔΔGfold; (ii) the
mutational statistical signiﬁcance values of all sequences calcu-
lated by PRODA; (iii) the top-ranked catalytic indicators in the
MD simulation; (iv) the sequence diversity of the variants; and (v)
inspection of the catalytic conformation in the MD simulation
trajectory. The top-ranked 14 in silico designs are labeled out in

designed variant. The catalytic indicator frequency of RMSDTS < 2.5 Å is calculated with theﬁrst frame in the MD simulation trajectory as the reference.
The hydrogen bonding criteria used in the catalytic indicators are deﬁned as: the bond length (Donor-Acceptor) is less than 3.5 Å and the bond angle
(Donor-H-Acceptor) is greater than 120 °. A graphical illustration of the catalytic indicators can be found in Fig. S3. Details can be seen in Tables S11, S12.

validation.
Characterization of the activity, stability, and structure of each
in silico-designed variant. The kinetic parameters of the WT
carboxylesterase Est30 and 14 in silico-designed variants with
regard to MHET hydrolysis at 50 °C and pH 7.5 are presented in
Table 1, Fig.5a, and Table S13. The reaction temperature (50 °C)
and pH value (7.5) for MHET hydrolysis were determined based
on the optimal reaction conditions of the FAST-PETase with
regard to PET depolymerization. Most of the in silico-designed
variants (11/14) had improved catalytic ef ﬁciencies compared
with the WT. Among the variants M8 (I171K/G130L, k
cat/
Km = 4.70 mM−1·s−1), M13 (I171K/M127S/G130F, kcat/
Km = 8.11 mM−1·s−1), and M14 (I171K/M127S/G130L, kcat/
Km = 12.58 mM−1·s−1) achieved 36.0, 62.1, and 96.3 folds higher
catalytic activities than the WT (kcat/Km = 0.13 mM−1·s−1). The
amino acid sequences of these variants are shown in Table S14.
The increases in catalytic activity of M8 (kcat = 21.43 s−1), M13
(kcat = 20.99 s−1), and M14 (kcat = 21.76 s−1) can be attributed
predominantly to their rate enhancements relative to the WT
(kcat = 1.17 s−1). This is consistent with the calculations shown in
Table 1, because our design strategy was to decrease the energy
barriers via TS stabilization73. In addition, the nucleophilic attack
distances of the three variants monitored in the 5 ns MD simu-
lation exhibited a predominant conformational distribution at
2.6–3.6 Å, which was required for a catalytically productive state,
whereas the nucleophilic attack distance of the WT was dis-
tributed over larger distances, and could not be maintained in the
catalytically productive conformation (Fig. S10), indicating less
efﬁcient catalysis49,62,74. The protein melting temperature (Tm)
values of the WT and 14 variants were determined by differential
scanning calorimetry (DSC), and are presented in Table1, Fig.5b,
and Table S13. All the variants except for M1 (G130L, Tm =
76.39 °C) exhibited decreased thermal stability compared with
the WT (Tm = 74.07 °C), but all the variants were well expressed,
as conﬁrmed by the sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel
electrophoresis results (Fig. S24). The mutations I171K and
M127S, which were present in the highly efﬁcient variants M8
(Tm = 67.58 °C), M13 (Tm = 63.29 °C), and M14 (Tm = 63.18 °C),
introduced additional charged or polar functional groups to the
hydrophobic cavity to form hydrogen bonds with the carboxyl
group of MHET, as shown in Fig. 3d–f. This may explain
the sacriﬁce of stability, though these mutations did contribute
to the promotion of activity (Table 1) via TS stabilization.
The introduction of charged or polar residues inside the active
pocket generally disrupts the hydrophobic environment of
protein75, which may explain the reduced thermal stability of the
variants. The catalytic activities of variants M8, M13, and M14
decreased quickly when the hydrolytic temperature increased to
70 °C (Fig. S8). No secondary structure loss was observed at 50 °C
for variant M8 (Fig. 5b). Besides, the heat inactivation experi-
ments of variant M8 at 50 °C (Fig. S13) showed that M8 retained
75% residual activity after 96 h of incubation at 50 °C. All these
results indicate that variant M8 is potentially compatible with
FAST-PETase (Tm = 67.80 °C) at 50 °C for PET depolymeriza-
tion. Furthermore, the temperature (Fig. S11) and pH activity
(Fig. S12) proﬁle of variant M8 conﬁrmed that 50 °C and pH 7.5
are the optimal reaction conditions for M8 to catalyze the
hydrolysis of MHET.
The crystal structure of the most active variant M14 (I171K/
M127S/G130L) was obtained to determine whether the computa-
tional design was realized in the actual experiments. The overall
structure of M14 (PDB: 8ILT) and its alignment with that of the
WT (PDB:1TQH) are shown in Fig. S14. The RMSDs of the
main-chain atoms of M14 were only 1.51 Å, and the hydrolase
domains of the two structures almost overlapped with each other.
Compared with the WT, the twoα-helices of the lid domain of
M14 shifted further towards the hydrolase domain. This was
consistent with the catalytic mechanism of a hydrolase, whereby
the lid domain moves between the open and closed conforma-
tions depending on the substrate binding63–65,68. The alignment
of the active sites of M14 and the WT in apo form are shown in
Fig. 5c. The catalytic triad and oxyanion hole residues of M14 had
similar conformations to those of the WT, with a RMSD of only
0.62 Å, implying that the rigid backbone assumption in our
computational enzyme design method held. A recapitulation
design was performed based on the crystal structure of M14, and
the computed binding geometries (Fig.5d) were aligned with that
based on the crystal structure of the WT. The three introduced
mutations I171K, M127S, and G130L in variant M14 were all in
the lid domain, and their backbones were displaced from those of
the WT. However, the computationally designed interactions, i.e.,
the hydrogen bonds between residues K171 or S127 and the
carboxyl terminus of TS, and the hydrophobic stacking between
L130 and the benzene ring of the TS all remained in the
recapitulation to stabilize the TS in perfect catalytic binding
geometry. This indicates that our computational enzyme design
tool PRODA is robust enough to tolerate a certain degree of
backbone ﬂuctuation.

Synergy between designed MHET hydrolase and PET hydrolase
for PET depolymerization. Although the PET hydrolases (LCC-
ICCG and FAST-PETase) had weak catalytic activities with
regard to the hydrolysis of MHET (Table S13), their low catalytic
efﬁciencies caused pronounced accumulation of MHET during
PET depolymerization. The perceived inhibitory effect of MHET
on the PET hydrolases led to inefﬁcient PET depolymerization
and a low TPA yield (Fig. S15). To overcome the aforementioned
obstacles to PET depolymerization using a single enzyme, the
synergistic effect of a mixed two-enzyme system was investigated
by measuring the extent of hydrolysis of a post-consumer bottle
grade PET powder substrate (Pc-PET, particle size 100–200 μm,
crystallinity 2.9%, Table S17) over 24 h at 50 °C using FAST-
PETase and the designed MHET hydrolase M8 (here denoted as
KL-MHETase) at various concentrations (Fig. 6a, b). Over the
range of enzyme loadings tested (1–6 mg FAST-PETase/g PET,
0–6 mg KL-MHETase/g PET), the conversion of PET, as deter-
mined by concentration of aromatic product released (the sum of
BHET, MHET, and TPA), scaled with FAST-PETase loading
(Fig. 6a), and the composition of TPA, as determined by
concentration of TPA in total products, scaled with KL-MHETase
loading (Fig. 6b). The conversion of PET decreased as KL-
MHETase loading increased at any particular FAST-PETase
loading, indicating that the addition of KL-MHETase affected the
binding between the PET polymer substrate and FAST-PETase.
The complex structure of the dual enzyme system was predicted
using the protein structure prediction tool AlphaFold-Mutimer67,
as shown in Fig.6d. The substrate-binding cleft of FAST-PETase
was partially blocked by the hydrolase domain of KL-MHETase.
Owing to the interaction between KL-MHETase and FASTase,
the composition of TPA varied nonlinearly with the increase in
FAST-PETase loading at any particular KL-MHETase loading
(Fig. 6b), indicating that there was an optimal ratio of KL-
MHETase to FAST-PETase for maximum TPA yield. Toﬁnd the
optimal ratio, the time-course of PET depolymerization (Fig.6c)
was measured over the range of KL-MHETase loadings
(0–0.33 μM enzyme/g PET) with ﬁxed FAST-PETase loading
(0.35 μM enzyme/g PET). The synergy study showed that both
the conversion of PET and the yield of TPA over 48 h were at
their maximum values when the molar ratio of KL-MHETase

(0.11 μM enzyme/g PET) to FAST-PETase (0.35μM enzyme/g
PET) was 2:6, and were higher than the corresponding values
obtained using FAST-PETase alone. This optimal value was fur-
ther corroborated by the synergistic PET degradation by FAST-
PETase and KL-MHETase at various ratios over 48 h at 50 °C
(Fig. S16a, b). It should be noted that during theﬁrst 36 h, the
conversion of PET using mixed dual enzyme systems with various
ratios of KL-MHETase to FAST-PETase fell behind that using the
single enzyme FAST-PETase owing to the deleterious interaction
between the two enzymes (Fig. 6d). This defect should be
removed to exploit the cascade effect of the dual enzyme system
for fast PET degradation.
Engineering of fusion dual enzyme system for fast PET depo-
lymerization. It is possible to control the complex structure of a
dual enzyme system by introducing a peptide linker between the
enzymes23. We hypothesized that it would be possible to fully
expose the active site of FAST-PETase, which binds the PET
polymer substrate, by constructing an appropriate linker between
the PET hydrolase and the in silico-designed MHET hydrolases.
Herein, the most active variant M14 (denoted as KLS-MHETase)
was also invoked, although its Tm (63.18 °C) is too low for a
reaction at 50 °C compared to theTm of FAST-PETase. A series of
ﬂexible glycine and serine linkers (L20, L28, and L36) of various
lengths and one rigid linker (L4) whose amino acid sequences are
given in Table S16 were used to covalently link the C terminus of
KL-MHETase or KLS-MHETase to the N terminus of FAST-
PETase or vice versa, resulting in the construction of a total of
eight fused enzymes (Table S16). The PET degradation activities
(Fig. 7a) of those eight fusion dual enzyme systems used at the
same molecular concentrations were investigated at 50 °C using a
Pc-PET powder substrate (particle size 100–200 μm) over 12 or
24 h. The PET degradation activities of the fusion dual enzyme
systems were strongly dependent on the linking order between
PETase and MHETase, the amino acid sequences of the linkers,
and the lengths of the linkers. The three fusion dual enzyme
systems KL20F, KL28F, and KL36F demonstrated higher con-
version rates than the single enzyme FAST-PETase over 24 h. The
complex structures of the eight dual enzyme systems were pre-
dicted using the protein structure prediction tool AlphaFold266,
as shown in Fig.7b and S17. As expected, the substrate-binding

clefts of the FAST-PETases in KL20F, KL28F, and KL36F were
completely exposed, and the active sites of the KL-MHETases in
those fusion enzymes were orientated towards the active sites of
the FAST-PETases. Furthermore, the active site orientation of two
enzymes in KL36F was validated by long time MD simulations
(Fig. S18). This facilitated the direct diffusion of the PET
degradation intermediate product MHET into the active site of
KL-MHETase. The intermediate product MHET was degraded
into the constituent monomers TPA and EG in situ, and the
inhibitory effect of MHET on FAST-PETase was immediately
eliminated, which promoted enzyme synergy and improved cat-
alytic efﬁciency. It should be noted that the PET degradation rate

of the fusion dual enzyme system KLS20F slowed down over 24 h,
although it was greater than the activity of the fusion dual enzyme
system KL20F over 12 h, probably because KLS20F afforded
higher catalytic efﬁciency (Table S13) with regard to MHET
hydrolysis but worse thermal stability than KL20F (Fig. S19,
Table S13).
The enzyme cascade effect of the constructed dual enzyme
system was investigated by time-course comparative analysis of
PET degradation using the most active fusion enzyme KL36F and
the single enzyme FAST-PETase (Fig. 7c). Under the same
enzyme loadings (molar concentrations), the PET degradation
intermediate product MHET hardly accumulated over 24 h using
the fusion enzyme KL36F, whereas using the single enzyme
FAST-PETase the composition of MHET in the sum of released
products was always above 31.7% (Fig. 7c). As a result, the
degradation conversion of PET, the yield of TPA, and the
composition of TPA in the released products using fusion enzyme
KL36F reached 82.9%, 82.5%, and 99.5% after 24 h, respectively,
which were 1.12, 1.64, and 1.47 folds greater than the
corresponding values using FAST-PETase (74.0%, 50.2%, and
67.8%, respectively). As the particle size of the Pc-PET powder
increased, the degradation rate of PET accelerated more with the
fusion enzyme, although the crystallinity of the substrate
increased (Table S17). When the Pc-PET particle sizes were
200–500 μm and 500–1000 μm, the degradation conversion rates
of PET after 12 h using the fusion enzyme KL36F were 2.0 and 2.6
folds higher than those using FAST-PETase, and the TPA yields
were 3.1 and 4.2 folds higher, respectively (Fig.7d). The fusion
enzyme KL36F was further compared with FAST-PETase across a
range of temperatures (Fig. S20, 40 –60 °C) and pH values
(Fig. S21, 6.0–9.0). The results suggest that KL36F emerged as a
superior candidate for PET degradation because it demonstrated
higher activity and thermal stability across the tested conditions.
The purity of TPA in the released products was dependent on
the fusion enzyme loadings. The composition of MHET was less
than 0.5% after 24 h when the fusion enzyme KL36F loading was
0.35 μM, whereas it increased to 13.9% when the enzyme loading
decreased to 0.05μM (Fig. 7e). The catalytic efﬁciency of KL36F
with regard to MHET hydrolysis was 3.64 mM
−1·s−1 (Table S13),
which was comparable to that of KL-MHETase and 52.6-fold
higher than that of FAST-PETase. Although the hydrolytic
activities of the fusion enzymes with regard to MHET were
approximately 28–37-fold higher than the hydrolytic activity of
FAST-PETase (Fig. 7f), the dominant degradation pathway of
FAST-PETase on PET polymer is random in-chain scission. This
is because the PET hydrolase FAST-PETase has a surface-
exposed, shallow active site16, which results in an exponential rate
of production of the degradation intermediate product MHET,
leading to the accumulation of MHET when the fusion enzyme
loadings are low. This implies that a thermostable MHET
hydrolase with even higher catalytic activity is critical for the
development of more economical PET recycling processes in
which the enzyme loading is reduced.
We further compared the performance of FAST-PETase and
KL36F in large reaction systems (PET substrate concentration of
100 g/L and system volume of 50 mL). As that shown in Fig.8,
KL36F achieved PET conversion and TPA yield of 90% and
89.0%, respectively, at 60 h, which were 1.9 and 1.8 times higher
than those of FAST-PETase. Notably, the purity of TPA in the
aromatic products obtained in the dual enzyme system exceeded
99% at any time point and the MHET concentration of the
system was only up to 4 mM. In contrast, the MHET
concentration in the single enzyme system reached up to
20 mM, which may have led to a product inhibition of FAST-
PETase, resulting in a stagnant conversion of 53% for PET
degradation. Another replicate experiment showed similar results,
as that shown in Fig. S22. These results suggest that the fusion
enzyme KL36F retains its superior performance over FAST-
PETase under high substrate concentrations76, thereby demon-
strating its potential applicability in the industrial recycling of
PET.
Discussion
Although MHET hydrolases are crucial for PET depolymerization
into its constituent monomers, the currently available MHET
hydrolases, which are either thermally unstable or have poor
activity, cannot match the recently designed PET hydrolases such
as FAST-PETase12 and LCC-ICCG11 at their optimal reaction
temperatures (50 or 70 °C). Simultaneously promoting stability
and activity is a great challenge for enzyme engineering because
the evolution of one is always accompanied by loss of the
other77,78. Our design strategy was to ﬁrst search a structural
database for a thermophilic scaffold with promiscuous activity
with regard to MHET hydrolysis, and then promote its catalytic
activity by computational active site redesign. Thanks to the sub-
angstrom accuracy and speed of our active site-matching algo-
rithm ProdaMatch, we were able to identify ﬁve thermostable
scaffolds from the experimental structural database (PDB), which
comprised 0.18 million protein entries, and we experimentally
conﬁrmed their promiscuous activities with regard to the
hydrolysis of MHET at 50 °C. As shown in Fig. S23, the most
efﬁcient PET hydrolase (LCC-ICCG) was able to degrade nearly
100% of the PET powder at 70 °C within only 24 h, but MHET
still accounted for a large portion (24%) of the aromatic product.
Therefore, we anticipate that our active site-matching Proda-
Match algorithm will be used to search more thermostable scaf-
folds that are able to match LCC-ICCG at 70 °C from the
predicted structural database (AlphaFold), which has over 200
million protein entries with acceptable accuracies for scaffold
selection.
Although a selected scaffold may be thermostable, active site
redesign to promote its catalytic activity may compromise its

stability77. Therefore, the computational enzyme design algo-
rithm should be able to select mutations that promote the cata-
lytic activity of the scaffold without adversely affecting its melting
temperature. The structural characteristics of the substrate
MHET suggest that one Lys or Arg should be introduced into the
active site of the selected scaffold to build a strong hydrogen
bonding network with the terminal carboxyl group of MHET to
stabilize the TS. But, the introduction of one positively charged
Lys or Arg in the hydrophobic pocket of a protein tends to
compromise its stability75. In fact, one Lys was introduced in all
the highly active variants based on the 1TQH scaffold, i.e., M8
(I171K/G130L), M13 (I171K/M127S/ G130F), and M14 (I171K/
M127S/G130L), and we noted that the single mutation I171K in
variant M2 (Tm = 65.08 °C) decreased its melting temperature by
9 °C compared with that of the WT (Tm = 74.07 °C). Our com-
putational enzyme design algorithm PRODA identiﬁed mutations
G130L and G130F, and we found that the single variants M1
(G130L) and M3 (G130F) (Table S13) had improved catalytic
efﬁciencies and higher melting temperatures. Moreover, we noted
that the mutation G130L in variant M1 promoted the turnover
number compared with that of the WT owing to the hydrophobic
stacking between L130 and the benzene ring of the TS. The
combination of mutations I171K and G130L produced the highly
efﬁcient thermostable variant M8, whose rate constant (21.43 s−1)
at 50 °C is comparable to that of the native MHETase (11.1/31/
50.58 s−1)22,23,64 at 30 °C. The protein melting temperature of M8
(Tm = 67.58 °C) is comparable to that of FAST-PETase (Tm =
67.80 °C). Moreover, the catalytic ef ﬁciency (4.70 mM−1s−1,
Table S13) of M8 with regard to MHET hydrolysis is 67.14-fold
higher than that (0.07 mM−1s−1, Table S13) of FAST-PETase.
Therefore, we identiﬁed a MHET hydrolase that could match
PET hydrolase FAST-PETase in terms of PET depolymerization

activity at 50 °C. All the MHET hydrolases are reported in
Table S1. The MHET hydrolases that could operate properly over
50 °C, e.g., TfCa-WA (I69W/V376A) and TTCE, all had modest
activities with regard to MHET hydrolysis, i.e., hundreds of times
less active than M8 (KL-MHETase). The Est30 scaffold has a
smaller lid structural domain compared to the extensive lid
structural domain of natural MHETase (Fig. S6), which enables
the enzyme binding pocket to capture intermediates (mainly
MHET) more readily during PET degradation by PET hydrolases
in cascade catalysis. The homologous sequence alignment
between the Est30 scaffold and the native MHETase
23 is shown in
Fig. S7, and the low sequence identity of the two scaffolds (17.4%)
demonstrates the potential of our computational enzyme design
method for inventing new enzymes.
The polymeric characteristics of the PET substrate and
protein–protein interactions demand extraordinary control of the
orientation of the active sites of MHET hydrolase and PET
hydrolase. Moreover, the complex structure spontaneously
formed between KL-MHETase and FAST-PETase in a mixed dual
enzyme system has restricted PET degradation efﬁciency com-
pared with that of a single enzyme. With the aid of protein
structure prediction tools AlphaFold2 66 and AlphaFold-
Mutimer67 we constructed suitable peptides to link KL-
MHETase and FAST-PETase. The engineered fused dual
enzyme system KL36F depolymerized 82.5% of a Pc-PET powder
into its constituent monomer TPA within 24 h, and TPA
accounted for more than 99.5% of the released aromatic products.
In contrast, the TPA yield and purity were only 50.2% and 67.8%,
respectively, for the single enzyme FAST-PETase. In large reac-
tion systems with 100 g/L substrate concentrations, the dual
enzyme system KL36F achieved over 90% PET depolymerization
into monomers, which was far greater than that (55%) of single
enzyme system FAST-PETase. These results suggest that the
fusion enzyme KL36F has achieved industrial degradation of PET
at 50 °C, and the solid loading capacity reaches the industrial scale
demonstrated by LCC-ICCG at 72 °C. The dual enzyme syner-
gistic effect was not detected in the recently reported dual enzyme
systems TfCut2-TfCa
37, immobilized PETase-MHETase23, LCC-
TTCE39, and PETase PM-TfCa WA40 because either their MHET
hydrolases were not stable at 50 °C or their catalytic activities
were too low.
The computational enzyme design strategy developed in the
present research is general, and we expect that super-
thermostable MHET hydrolases that are stable at the optimal
PET degradation temperature (70 °C) will be developed soon. The
extremely pure TPA from the conversion of post-consumer PET
plastics by dual enzyme systems may be directly used for polymer
synthesis after applying simple separation techniques such as
centrifugation and crystallization. This will greatly reduce the cost
of recycling PET. Therefore, the present study will help to
expedite the industrialization of the enzymatic recycling of PET
plastics, and will ultimately contribute to a circular economy.
Methods
Structural data. In total, 104 protein structures used for scaffold
selection and computational enzyme design were obtained from
the PDB79. The crystal structure of the designed enzyme KLS-
MHETase was determined in the present study and deposited in
the PDB (PDB Code: 8ILT). Water molecules in the original
1TQH scaffold for active site redesign were removed and the
amino acid hydrogen atoms were added using PRODA based on
the topology parameters of the all-atom CHARMM 22 force
ﬁeld80. The atomic coordinate of substrate MHET was taken from
PubChem ( https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), and hydrogen
atoms were added using the molecular modeling software
Discovery Studio. The protonation state of the residues of the
1TQH scaffold was assigned after carefully examining the
environment around each residue and referring to the pKa values
given by PROPKA 3.081 at the reference pH (7.5).
Scaffold selection. A thermophilic hydrolase scaffold library with
104 protein entities was collected from the PDB based on the
following criteria: (i) it was possible to express the protein in
Escherichia coli; (ii) it was possible to obtain the protein structure
at a structural resolution of better than 3.0 Å by X-ray crystal-
lography; (iii) the length of the amino acid sequence was between
200 and 800; (iv) the sequence identity in the set was lower than
95%; (v) the results were determined by searching the keywords:
“thermophilic, thermophile, thermophila, thermophilus”; and (vi)
the enzyme classiﬁcation name was hydrolases. For each scaffold,
the three largest pockets were identiﬁed using the cavity-detecting
module ProdaPocket in PRODA, with each pocket including up
to 100 design positions. The scaffold-independent parameter used
to evaluate the geometry penalty was obtained and is shown in
Table S4. The fast and accurate active site matching algorithm
ProdaMatch
57,58 in PRODA was used to check whether the active
site model could be anchored into the incumbent scaffold. All
matches produced in one scaffold were ranked by a scoring
function. To identify scaffolds with a catalytic triad motif, cata-
lytic residues Ser and His were anchored at positions with iden-
tical amino acid types, whereas Asp was anchored at positions
whose native types were either Asp or Glu.
Computational enzyme design. The computational active site
redesign of Est30 was carried out using the PRODA enzyme
design protocol54,56–58. The amino acid hydrogen atoms were
added using PRODA in accordance with the topology parameters
of the all-atom CHARMM 22 forceﬁeld. The sequence selection
positions that are allowed variation of the amino acid type, and
the residues that provided optimal side-chain conformations are
shown in Table S7. The backbone atoms at the selected positions,
and all atoms at other positions, were kept rigid and referenced as
the scaffold template. A backbone-independent rotamer library
82
containing 11,810 original rotamers was used to model the side-
chain conformations of the design sites. In addition, the crystal
conformations at the design positions of the scaffold template
were included in the rotamer library. The rotamers of serine,
threonine, and tyrosine were expanded owing to the diverse
conﬁgurations adopted
57 by the hydroxyl hydrogen atom. The
substrate structure of MHET (Fig. S3) in the TS was built by
changing the central ester atom so that it had an intermediate
tetrahedron geometry. The atomic van der Waals parameters for
MHET were obtained from the model molecules of the
CHARMM 22 force ﬁeld, and the atomic partial charges were
assigned based on the PARSE models83. A library of TS con-
formers for the computational model was generated and screened
in accordance with the placing rules (Table S5) and catalytic
geometrical constraints (Table S6) using the previously proposed
small-molecule placement approach55,72. The free energy of the
enzyme–substrate complex in the TS was calculated using the
energy functions mentioned in our earlier work 55–57. The
mutation sequences corresponding to the global or near-global
minimum energy conformations (GMEC) of the
enzyme–substrate complex in the TS were computed using the
dead-end elimination/linear programming/mixed-integer linear
programming-based deterministic global optimization algorithm
developed in our previous work55–57. To adequately search the
conformational and sequence space, a large number of sequences
around the global minimum energy sequence were generated by
imposing the restriction whereby a predeﬁned number of rotamer

types were different for any two sequences. The free energy of the
bound enzyme-TS complex system (ΔGbound) was the sum of
binding energy (ΔGbind) and folding energy (ΔGfold). The binding
energy (ΔGbind) was calculated as the energy difference between
the bound enzyme-TS system and the unbound enzyme-TS sys-
tem, as shown in Eq.1:
ΔGbind ¼ ΔGbound /C0 ΔGunbound ð1Þ
where ΔGbound and ΔGunbound are the free energies of the complex
and the unbound enzyme-TS systems.
The folding energies are the free energies of the apo-form
enzyme, equal toΔGunbound, as shown in Eq.2:
ΔGfold ¼ ΔGunbound ð2Þ
The binding energy change upon mutation (ΔΔGbind;Mut)i s
computed as the difference of the binding energies of the wild-
type (ΔGbind;WT) and mutant enzyme-TS system (ΔGbind;Mut), as
shown in Eq.3:
ΔΔGbind;Mut ¼ ΔGbind;Mut /C0 ΔGbind;WT ð3Þ
The folding energy charge upon mutation ( ΔΔGfold;Mut)i s
computed as the difference of the folding energies of the wild-
type (ΔGfold;WT) and mutant enzymes (ΔGfold;Mut), as shown in
Eq. 4:
ΔΔGfold;Mut ¼ ΔGfold;Mut /C0 ΔGfold;WT ð4Þ
More details can be found in the SI.
Molecular dynamics simulation . The MD simulations were
carried out using GROMACS 2019.4 84. The initial complex
coordinates of the designs were copied from the results computed
by PRODA. The topologies of the designs were generated by
GROMACS using the CHARMM36 all-atom force ﬁeld. The
topology of the corresponding small molecule, i.e., the TS, was
prepared using the online CGenFF program 1.0.0
85,86 and its
atom types, bond parameters, and atomic partial charges were
built to be consistent with the de ﬁnitions of the CHARMM
General Force Field 3.0.187,88. The δ nitrogen of the catalytic
histidine residue (His223) was protonated in accordance with the
catalytic mechanism of an esterase. The new protein–TS complex
structure was immersed in a dodecahedral box whose size was
determined by setting the distance between the solute and the box
to 10 Å, and the box wasﬁlled by the addition of approximately
12,000 explicit water molecules represented by the water model
TIP3P89. The charge of the system was neutralized by adding an
appropriate number of Na + or Cl − counter ions to the
solvent box.
Each simulation was independently initiated with energy
minimization (EM) of the system using the steepest descent
minimization algorithm, and EM continued until the potential
energy was negative and the maximum force Fmax was not greater
than 1000 kJ∙mol−1∙nm−1. Next, a position-restrained NVT phase
(NVT = constant temperature and constant volume) simulation
was performed using simulated annealing to warm the system.
For the 1 and 5 ns MD simulations, the temperature was
gradually increased from 0 to 343 K within 150 ps, then stabilized
at 343 K for a further 30 ps. Subsequently, the system underwent a
position-restrained NPT (NPT = constant temperature and
constant pressure) simulation of 100 or 200 ps, and 1 or 5 ns
production MD simulation, respectively. The time step was set to
1 fs for NVT and 2 fs for NPT. Constant temperature was
maintained using the velocity rescaling thermostat90 and constant
pressure was maintained using the Berendsen barostat91,92. In the
position-restrained simulations and MD simulations, the LINCS
algorithm was used to impose constraints on the bonds and
angles of the complex. The Particle Mesh Ewald method93,94 was
used to model long-range electrostatic effects, and short-range
van der Waals interactions were cut off at 12 Å. The differential
equations of motion were integrated by a leap-frog algorithm.
The 1 and 5 ns MD simulations were repeated 10 and 5 times,
respectively; the time step was 2 fs, and the coordinates of all the
atoms in the system were saved every 10 ps, which generated a
total of 100 frames and 500 frames, respectively. Post-simulation
data extraction and analysis were performed using the GRO-
MACS analysis tools. Snapshots of enzyme interactions with
MHET were analyzed and visualized using PyMOL 2.4.0 software
(https://pymol.org/). More details can be found in the SI.
Protein structure prediction. The prediction tool AlphaFold2
66
was used to predict the protein structure of each fusion protein.
AlphaFold-Multimer67 was used to predict the structure of the
KL-MHETase and FAST-PETase protein complexe. The number
of models was set atﬁve. The “max_template_data” was set at
“2022-10-10”. The “preset” parameter was set at “full_dbs” to
balance the time of prediction and the quality of the result. The
result model with the highest pLDDT score was selected for
further visual inspection and analysis.
Chemicals. Bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), mono
(hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET), and terephthalic acid
(TPA) were obtained from Bide Pharmatech Ltd (Shanghai,
China).
Gene cloning, plasmid construction, and site-directed muta-
genesis. The genes of selected scaffolds were obtained from
Genebank ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov /genbank/), and the
codon was optimized using a web tool (http://genomes.urv.es/
OPTIMIZER/). All genes were synthesized by the Beijing Geno-
mics Institution (Beijing, China). The pET-22b (+) vector was
combined with each synthesized gene to create an ampicillin-
resistant clone. The synthesized gene fragment was ligated into
the NdeI and XhoI sites on the vector, and the C-terminal hexa-
histidine tag was ligated into the WT enzyme and its mutants.
Variants of Est30 were created by site-directed mutagenesis and
the mutations were validated by automated DNA sequencing
techniques.
Enzyme expression and puriﬁcation. TheEscherichia colistrain
BL21(DE3) provided the host cells for protein cloning and
expression of the WT and mutant enzymes, and the strains were
grown overnight (over 14 h) at 37 °C in solid lysogeny broth (LB)
medium containing 75 μg·mL−1 ampicillin. Single colonies
growing well were transferred into 50 mL of liquid LB medium
with 75μg·mL−1 ampicillin, and incubated at 37 °C and 200 rpm
for 7 h. Next, 2 mL of each liquid bacterial germ was transferred
to 200 mL of fresh liquid LB medium with 75μg·mL−1 ampicillin,
and incubated at 37 °C and 200 rpm until the OD600 (the optical
density of a sample measured at a wavelength of 600 nm) reached
0.6–0.8. Protein expression was induced with 0.5 mM isopropyl-
β-thiogalactopyranoside, and cells were harvested after a further
incubation at 18 °C and 200 rpm for over 16 h. After cen-
trifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in 50 mM sodium
phosphate buffer (pH 7.5) and subjected to 30 min of ultra-
sonication cycles (4 s on and 6 s off) at 60% amplitude. The
periplasmic extracts were centrifuged at 10,000g for 30 min, and
the insoluble cell debris was removed. The clariﬁed lysate was
then puriﬁed in a 5 mL HisTrap HP (Cytiva) column using an
ӒKTA Pure chromatography system (Cytiva) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. Subsequently, the fractions contain-
ing the puriﬁed enzyme were desalted three times using a 10 kDa

cut-off Amicon® Ultra 15 mL Centrifugal Filter device (EMD
Millipore Corporation). The protein concentration was then
determined using a BCA95 Protein Assay Kit (Beyotime Bio-
technology) and an Inﬁnite M200 PRO microplate reader (Tecan)
to measure the absorbance (A562 nm) of each assay mixture. The
presence and purity of the puriﬁed proteins were assessed by
sodium dodecyl sulfate –polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
(Fig. S24).
PET powder preparation. Post-consumer bottle grade PET was
obtained from commercial bottles (body only; the neck and base
were removed from the bottle) from the Coca-Cola Company
(China). The PET was cut into a 10 × 10 mm pieces, washed with
water, 0.5% sodium dodecyl sulfate, and ethyl alcohol, dried, and
shredded into particles using an AM500S high-speed rotary mill
(Ants Scienti ﬁc Instruments (Beijing) Co., Ltd) operated at
8000 rpm. The particles were sifted using 100, 200, 500, and
1000 μm sieves to obtain post-consumer bottle grade PET pow-
ders with particle sizes in the ranges 100–200, 200–500, and
500–1000 μm.
PET depolymerization assay . Different particle sizes in the
ranges 100–200, 200–500, and 500–1000 μm of post-consumer
bottle grade PET powders were used for depolymerization. An
enzyme solution (3 mL) in 100 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0)
was incubated with appropriately 5.0 mg of the PET substrate in a
5 mL glass bottle. The concentration of FAST-PETase was
0.35 μM (6 mg enzyme/g PET) in the single enzyme experimental
group, while the concentration of KL-MHETase was 0.05, 0.11,
0.16, 0.33μM in the dual enzyme experimental group. The con-
centration of all fusion enzymes used was 0.35μM, while the
concentration of KL36F was 0.05, 0.11, 0.17, 0.35 μM in the
experimental group for testing effect of enzyme loadings. The test
bottle was tightly capped and wrapped in paraﬁlm to minimize
volatilization. The bottle was then incubated in a heat block
(Jingxin, Shanghai) at 50 or 70 °C and agitated at 800 rpm for the
indicated time (4, 8, 12, 24, 36 or 48 h). At each speciﬁed time-
point, the reaction was terminated by adding an equal volume of
methanol and the supernatant was collected by centrifugation
(10,000 g for 3 min). Prior to analysis, each sample was diluted
10-fold, andﬁltered through a 0.25μm ﬁlter plate using a vacuum
syringe into a 2 mL collection plate, which was sealed with a
silicone mat. The amounts of the products of PET hydrolysis, i.e.,
BHET, MHET, and TPA, were quantiﬁed by high-performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC). All samples were analyzed in
triplicate in each independent experiment, and the average value
and standard deviation were calculated.
PET depolymerization bioreactor assay. The large scale reaction
was carried out in 50 mL phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 8.0) in
duplicate in a three-neckedﬂask. 5 g (10%) of 100–200 μm post-
consumer PET powder was added. The amount of FAST-PETase
added was 60.0 mg, resulting in aﬁnal concentration of 12 mg/g
PET (40.5μM), while the amount of KL36F added was 120.0 mg,
resulting in aﬁnal concentration of 24 mg/g PET (40.5μM). The
three-necked ﬂask was placed in a heat-collecting constant tem-
perature magnetic stirrer to stir the reaction solution and keep the
reaction temperature at 50 °C. Meanwhile, a pH meter was used
to measure the pH value of the reaction solution, and 4 M NaOH
solution was added to adjust the pH of the reaction solution
among 7.8–8.2. Sample volumes of 500μl were removed at 4, 8,
12, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72 h, and then quenched, diluted to an
appropriate concentration, centrifuged, andﬁltered as described
above. After reaction, the remained PET substrate was collected
by ﬁltration through 0.45μm jar-topﬁlter units and dried at 50 °C
before testing the crystallinity of the PET powder using DSC.
Kinetic measurements of MHET hydrolysis. The enzyme reac-
tions were performed in triplicate over 10 min using the puriﬁed
enzyme (0.1–2 μM) and a MHET substrate (2–20 mM) in 50 mM
sodium phosphate (pH 7.5) at 50 °C. Each reaction was termi-
nated using an equal volume (600μL) of 100% methanol. In the
control group, 600 μL of methanol was added in advance to
300 μL of the enzyme solution to deactivate the enzyme. The
product and substrate were quanti ﬁed by HPLC. The initial
reaction velocities were calculated from the TPA produced over
time, and the kinetic parameters were determined by nonlinear
regression of the initial velocities and substrate concentrations
ﬁtted to the Michaelis–Menten equation (Eq.1).

The Michaelis –Menten equation curve ﬁttings used to
determine the kinetic parameters of the WT Est30 and the
variants are shown in Fig. S9.
pH proﬁle of MHET hydrolysis activity. For variant M8 (I171K/
G130L), the pH dependency of MHET hydrolysis activity was
determined at pH values of 6.0, 6.5, 7.0, 7.5, and 8.0. The enzyme
reactions were performed in triplicate with 200 nM puri ﬁed
enzyme in 600 μL of 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer at the
various pH values and at 50 °C. The MHET concentration was
4.8 mM. After 10 min, each reaction was terminated using an
equal volume (600μL) of 100% methanol.
Temperature proﬁle of MHET hydrolysis activity. The effect of
temperature on MHET hydrolysis activity was determined at 40,
45, 50, 55, 60, 65, and 70 °C. The pH was 7.5 and the other
conditions were the same as those used in the pH pro ﬁle
experiment.
HPLC method. The contents of TPA, MHET, and BHET were
determined using a CMB-20A system (Shimadzu) connected to
an SPD-20A UV/Vis detector and a SunFire™ C18 column (5μm,
4.6 × 250 mm) with a gradient comprising acetonitrile and 0.1%
(v/v) formic acid in water at 30 °C after injection of each 10 µL
sample. The acetonitrile content was increased from 5% to 44%
over 13 min, and then to 70% after 18 min, at which point the
ratio was kept constant for 5 min. TPA, MHET, and BHET were
detected at 254 nm (Fig. S25) and quantiﬁed using calibration
curves.
Crystal structure determination . The Est30 variant KLS-
MHETase was concentrated to 15 mg·mL−1 in 10 mM Tris-HCl
(pH 8.0), 200 mM NaCl, and 5 mM dithiothreitol. Crystals were
grown using the hanging-drop vapor diffusion method. Crystals
of KLS-MHETase were grown at 18 °C by mixing an equal
volume of the protein (15 mg·mL−1) with a reservoir solution
containing 0.2 M zinc acetate tetrahydrate and 20% w/v poly-
ethylene glycol 3350 (pH 6.4). The crystals appeared overnight
and grew to a maximum size in approximately 2–3 days. The
crystals were cryoprotected in a reservoir solution containing 20%
glycerol before transfer to liquid nitrogen. All data were collected
at Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility beamlines BL02U1
and BL19U1, integrated and scaled using the HKL2000
package96. The initial model of KLS-MHETase was obtained by
modeling using AlphaFold266. The structure of KLS-MHETase
was solved by molecular replacement, and was reﬁned manually
using COOT97. The structure was further reﬁned with PHENIX98
using non-crystallographic symmetry and stereochemical

information as constraints. The ﬁnal structure was obtained
through several rounds of reﬁnement. The data collection and
structure reﬁnement statistics are summarized in Table S15. The
accession number for the coordinate and structure factors
reported in the present paper is PDB: 8ILT (KLS-MHETase).
Melting temperature (T
m) values of the enzymes determined by
DSC. The melting temperature (Tm) of each enzyme was deter-
mined using a MicroCal PEAQ DSC system (Malvern Panalytical,
Malvern, UK). The puri ﬁed proteins were diluted to
0.5–1.0 mg·mL−1 in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5),
and degassed immediately prior to testing. The samples were
heated from 30 to 120 °C at a rate of 3 °C per min during the
measurement. The baseline value of the buffer without protein
was removed from the protein trace. EachT
m value is the average
of two measurements.
Analytical method for determining PET crystallinity. DSC was
used to determine the crystallinity of each PET sample investi-
gated in the present paper. The PET sample (4–6 mg) was placed
on an aluminum pan with a solid sample cover. It wasﬁrst heated
from 30 to 300 °C at 10 °C·min−1, maintained at 300 °C for 1 min,
cooled from 300 to 30 °C at−10 °C·min−1, and held at 30 °C for
1 min in a DSC 8000 system (PerkinElmer) with an automatic
liquid nitrogen chiller. The enthalpy of melting (ΔHm) and the
enthalpy of cold crystallization (ΔHcc) were used to determine the
percentage crystallinity during the heating scan, according to the
following equation (Eq.2):
%crystallinity ¼½ ΔH
m /C0 ΔHcc/C138 =ΔH

m ´ 100% ð6Þ
where ΔH
/C14
m is the enthalpy of melting of a 100% crystalline PET
sample (i.e., 140.1 J·g−1)99. Each crystallinity value is the average
of two measurements.
Statistics and reproducibility . Enzyme kinetic data, MHET
hydrolysis assay activity, and PET hydrolysis assay activity were
obtained from the average of three parallel experiments. The
feature values for the 1 ns and 5 ns MD simulations were averaged
over 10 and 5 replications, respectively.
