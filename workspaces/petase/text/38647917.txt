Constructing Escherichia coli co-display 
systems for biodegradation of polyethylene 
terephthalate
Jiayu Hu1 and Yijun Chen1*   
Abstract 
Background The accumulation of fast-growing polyethylene terephthalate (PET) wastes has posed numerous 
threats to the environments and human health. Enzymatic degradation of PET is a promising approach for PET waste 
treatment. Currently, the efficiency of various PET biodegradation systems requires further improvements.
Results In this work, we engineered whole cell systems with co-display of strong adhesive proteins and the most 
active PETase for PET biodegradation in E. coli cells. Adhesive proteins of cp52k and mfp-3 and Fast-PETase were 
simultaneously displayed on the surfaces of E. coli cells, and the resulting cells displaying mfp-3 showed 50% increase 
of adhesion ability compared to those without adhesive proteins. Consequently, the degradation rate of E. coli cells 
co-displaying mfp-3 and Fast-PETase for amorphous PET exceeded 15% within 24 h, exhibiting fast and thorough PET 
degradation.
Conclusions Through the engineering of co-display systems in E. coli cells, PET degradation efficiency was signifi-
cantly increased compared to E. coli cells with sole display of Fast-PETase and free enzyme. This feasible E. coli co-dis-
play system could be served as a convenient tool for extending the treatment options for PET biodegradation.

Introduction
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is an aromatic polyes -
ter plastic with the largest production and consumption 
in the world. The extensive use of PET has generated a 
huge amount of PET wastes. Although PET wastes could 
be treated by chemical methods, the requirement of 
valuable energy and costly catalyst and the production 
of environmentally harmful effluent has been a major 
obstacle for applications. By contrast, biodegradation is a 
green and efficient way for PET waste treatment. Up to 
date, several PET hydrolases have been reported. Among 
them, IsPETase (Yoshida et  al. 2016), discovered in Ide -
onella sakiensis in 2016, has been regarded as the most 
promising enzyme. IsPETase could efficiently hydro -
lyse the ester bond of PET under ambient temperatures 
to generate bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), 
mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) and tere -
phthalic acid (TPA), and the most abundant hydro -
lytic product MHET could be further broken down into 
TPA and ethylene glycol by another enzyme, MHETase, 
derived from the same bacterium (Fig.  1A). To overcome 
the limitations of using free enzymes, such as instability 
and time-consuming purification process, various whole 
cell systems have been constructed for PET biodegrada -
tion using the PETases from different sources (Chen et al. 
2022, 2020; Gercke et al. 2021; Jia et al. 2022; Zhu et al. 
2022). However, the efficiency of PET biodegradation by 
these systems is still lower than realistic applications.
Because PET is an insoluble polymer with a hydro -
phobic and smooth surface, it is necessary for PETases 
to bind with the surface of PET before hydrolysis tak -
ing place based on the surface erosion process for enzy -
matic PET hydrolysis (Kawai et al. 2019). Yet, it remains 
as a difficult task because all available PETases lack spe -
cific substrate binding domains (Joo et al. 2018). Conse -
quently, the substrate binding process is a rate-limiting 
step in PET biodegradation (Katyal and Montclare 2020).
Previously, carbohydrate-binding proteins (Dai et  al. 
2021; Xue et al. 2021) and fungus-derived hydrophob -
ins (Puspitasari and Lee 2021; Ribitsch et al. 2015) have 
been fused with PET hydrolases to elevate their catalytic 
performances. Unfortunately, only limited increases of 
the efficiency on PET degradation were observed (usu -
ally 0.2-0.6-fold of improvement). Recently, a co-display 
system with a hydrophobin and a variant of PETase on 
the cell surfaces of yeasts was reported for PET deg -
radation (Chen et  al. 2022). Despite the remarkable 
increase of the efficiency for degrading high-crystallin -
ity (45%) PET compared to purified free PETase at low 
concentrations, this yeast co-display system is still far 
from ideal for industrial application, mainly because it 
takes 10 days to reach ~ 10.9% degradation. In addition, 
in this yeast co-display system, the relatively weaker 
adhesive ability of the fungus-derived hydrophobin and 
slower hydrolytic rate of PETase variant (S160A) might 
also limit its efficiency on PET degradation.
To address above-mentioned shortcomings for fur -
ther improvement, we sought to introduce PET adhesion 
modules to Escherichia coli systems for facilitating the 
substrate binding process with stronger adhesive proteins 
along with the use of the best variant of IsPETase for PET 
biodegradation.
To accomplish strong adhesions, the selection of adhe -
sive proteins is critically important. Two adhesive pro -
teins were utilized and compared in this study according 
to the properties and previous reports. The first one is 
cp52k (GenBank ATB53756.1) from stalked barnacle 
Pollicipes pollicipes (Rocha et  al. 2019), a hydrophobic 
protein belonging to barnacle cement proteins (CP) and 
vital for the underwater adhesion of stalked barnacles. 
Because cp52k contains over 50% hydrophobic amino 
acids, this characteristic makes it possible to form strong 
hydrophobic reactions with PET surfaces. The other is 
mfp-3 (GenBank BAB16314.1), a type of mussel adhesive 
protein with only 46 amino acids. This protein is known 
to form strong π-π and cation-π interactions with poly -
styrene (PS) and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) (Lu 
et al. 2013), which has been extensively used as an adhe -
sive for various purposes (Yang et  al. 2013). To achieve 
effective surface display of these adhesive proteins, ice-
nucleation protein (INP), an outer membrane protein of 
Pseudomonas syringae (Wolber 1993), was employed to 
facilitate the process. INP is composed of a N-terminal 
domain, a C-terminal domain and a highly repetitive 
central domain. For optimal anchoring behaviors, a trun -
cated form of INP containing the N- and C-terminal por-
tions (INPNC) was previously used as an anchor protein 
to effectively display target proteins on cell surfaces (Jung 
et al. 1998).
The reasons of choosing E. coli as a chassis were based 
on its inherited advantages, including shorter doubling 
time, higher clonal homogeneity, clearer genetic back -
ground for manipulations and the ease and lower costs 
for high-density cultivation (Lee 1996; Pontrelli et  al. 
2018; Schwarzhans et  al. 2017). Moreover, E. coli is the 
most frequently used bacterial host for surface display 
with multiple carrier proteins to choose and utilize (van 
Bloois et al. 2011). As shown in Fig.  1B, dual surface dis -
play of an adhesive protein for PET binding and a PETase 
for the hydrolysis of PET would produce a synergistic 
effect on PET degradation, which could result in a signifi-
cant enhancement of degradation efficiency.

Materials and methods
Strains and plasmid constructions
E. coli DH5α was used as the host for cloning, and E. 
coli BL21 (DE3) was used as the host for protein expres -
sion and the construction of whole cell biocatalysts. The 
details of all strains, plasmids are summarized in Addi -
tional file 1: Table S1 and S2.
Recombinant plasmids were constructed using Vazyme 
ClonExpress MultiS One Step Cloning Kit C113 (Nan -
jing, China). To display the adhesive proteins (cp52k and 
mfp-3) on the surfaces of E. coli cells, the proteins were 
individually fused to INPNC (Jung et  al. 1998), yielding 
fusion proteins of INPNC-cp52k and INPNC-mfp with 
a myc tag at their C-termini. A moderate  lacO3O1 pro -
moter combined with a lac operator was used to con -
trol the inducible expression of the fusion proteins. To 
display Fast-PETase (Lu et al. 2022) on the surfaces of E. 
coli cells, a pelB signal peptide (MKYLLPTAAAGLLL -
LAAQPTMA) followed with a 6 × His-tag was put at the 
N-terminus of Fast-PETase, and the linker and β-barrel 
domains of yfaL (residues 743-1250; Swiss-Prot Entry 
P45508) were fused to the C-terminus of Fast-PETase, 
generating a fusion protein of AIDA-Fast-PETase. A 
moderately strong tac promoter combined with a lac 
operator was used to control inducible expression of this 
fusion protein. The key elements for the construction of 
plasmids are shown in Fig. 1B.
Cultivation conditions and protein expression
E. coli DH5α and E. coli BL21(DE3) cells carrying vari -
ous plasmids were cultured in Luria–Bertani broth (LB) 
medium (0.5% yeast extract, 1% tryptone and 1% NaCl) 
with corresponding antibiotics (50 µg/mL) at 37 °C. For 
the induction of protein expression, 1  mL of overnight 
cell culture was inoculated into 50 mL LB medium with 
corresponding antibiotics (50  µg/mL). Protein expres -
sion was induced by 0.1 mM IPTG addition when  OD600 
reached 1.0–1.2, and then continued at 25 °C for 20 h.
Protein analysis
Cell membrane proteins were extracted using the mem -
brane protein extraction kit (BestBio, Shanghai, China) 
for Western blotting analysis. For immunoprecipitation, 
cell membrane proteins extracted from 25 mg wet weight 
of E. coli cells were incubated with 70  μL A/G-agarose 
(Proteintech, #PR40025) and 2.5 μL primary anti-His 
mouse IgG antibody (Proteintech, #66005-1-Ig) in 1 mL 
phosphate buffer solution (PBS) at 4 °C overnight. Then, 
the beads were washed with PBS, and the immunopre -
cipitates were loaded for Western blotting analysis.
To establish a grayscale-protein concentration stand -
ard curve, Fast-PETase with a N-terminal 6  ×  His-tag 
was expressed in E. coli and purified by Ni-affinity 
chromatography. The purified His-tagged Fast-PETase 
with different concentrations was loaded for Western 
blotting analysis to establish the grayscale-protein con -
centration standard curve. To obtain displayed Fast-
PETase protein, the membrane fraction of E. coli cells 
displaying Fast-PETase was extracted and immuno -
precipitated (IP) with the antibody against His-tag for 
purifying and enriching Fast-PETase in the membrane 
fractions. Then, the IP samples were analyzed by Western 
blotting to quantify the exact amount of Fast-PETase dis-
played on the cell surfaces.
Immunofluorescent microscopy
Cells were harvested and washed with PBS, and resus -
pended in PBS with 1% BSA at 30 °C for 1 h. After block -
ing, samples were incubated with anti-His mouse IgG 
antibody (Proteintech, #66005-1-Ig, 1:1000 dilution) 
and anti-myc rabbit IgG antibody (Proteintech, #60003-
2-Ig, 1:1000 dilution) at 4  °C overnight. After washing 
with PBS, the cells were resuspended in PBS and incu -
bated with goat anti-rabbit IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor ® 647) 
(Abcam, #ab150079, 1:500 dilution) and goat anti-mouse 
IgG H&L (Alexa Fluor ® 488) (Abcam, #ab150113, 1:500 
dilution). Finally, cells were washed with PBS for immu -
nofluorescent microscopy.
PET adhesion assay
PET sheets were cut from commercial PET bottles with 
the size of 0.5 mm × 0.4 mm. The PET sheets were soaked 
with 75% ethanol and dried and then placed into a sterile 
24-well plate incubated with 1 mL of E. coli cells at room 
temperature overnight.
For crystal violet (CV) assay, culture broths were dis -
carded, and 1 mL sterile water was added into the wells 
and washed three times to remove weakly absorbed cells. 
Then, the wells were incubated with crystal violet. After 
washing with sterile water twice, the cells adhering to the 
PET sheets were examined under a microscope with oil 
immersion lens.
For colony-forming unit (CFU) assay, PET sheets were 
gently rinsed with sterile water, and the sheets were put 
into a tube containing 2  mL sterile water. The tube was 
vigorously shaken to release the attached cells. To remove 
residual E. coli cells on PET sheets, the sheets were placed 
in LB media and shaken at 37 ℃ for 24 h. The cell suspen-
sion was tenfold serially diluted with sterile water. Then, 
50  μL of diluted sample was spread onto LB agar plates 
containing kanamycin and incubated at 37 °C for 12 h. The 
colony numbers on the plates were counted for the calcula-
tion of cell density (CFU/cm2) on the PET sheets.

Whole cell biodegradation of PET
To generate amorphous PET, commercial PET bottles 
were cut into small pieces and dissolved in 1,1,1,3,3,3-hex-
afluoro-2-propanol with a final concentration of 50  mg/
mL. In each tube, 4 μL of this solution was added for the 
precipitation of amorphous PET (Meng et al. 2021). Every 
8  mg wet weight of E. coli cells were resuspended with 
50 mM Glycine–NaOH buffer (pH 9.0) to 200 μL in 2 mL 
tube. Amorphous PET (0.2  mg) was added into the tube. 
For purified free PETase, an equal amount of Fast-PETase 
displayed in 8 mg wet weight of the engineered strain was 
added to the same system. Then, the tube was shaken with 
a thermomixer at 30 °C for 24 h.
HPLC analysis of PET degradation products
Reaction tubes from above PET biodegradation were cen-
trifuged to remove E. coli cells. The supernatants (approxi-
mately 200  μL) were mixed with 100  μL methanol with 
shaking. Then, the tubes were centrifuged again, and the 
supernatants were used as the samples for HPLC analysis.
HPLC was performed on a 1260 Infinity II LC System 
(Agilent, Santa Clara, USA) equipped with a Phenom -
enex Gemini C18 column (dimensions: 250 × 4.6  mm, 
pore size: 110 Å, particle size: 5 µm). Mobile phase: water 
containing 0.1% formic acid (A), acetonitrile containing 
0.1% formic acid (B); elution gradient: 0–20  min: 10% 
B—50% B, 20–25  min: 50% B—90% B, 25–28  min: 90% 
B—10% B, 28–30 min: 10% B; column temperature: 40℃; 
flow rate: 1 mL/min; wavelength: 240 nm; injection vol -
ume: 20 µL. Different concentrations of MHET, TPA and 
BHET were analyzed to generate standard curves based 
on peak areas.
Calculation of PET degradation rate
The degradation rate (%) of PET was calculated according 
to following equation (Gercke et al. 2021):
n(TPA) , n(MHET) and n(BHET ) : molar amount of deg -
radation products of TPA, MHET and BHET, respec -
tively; M (MHET) and M(H2O) : molecular weight of 
MHET and  H2O; m(PET) : mass of PET substrate.
Results
Sole‑display of adhesive proteins on the surfaces of E. coli 
cells
To achieve desired adhesion with PET, appropriate 
adhesive proteins are a vital factor for surface display. 
Given the strong underwater adhesion ability of cer -
tain marine organisms, we expected that those marine 
[n(TPA ) + n(MHET ) + n(BHET )]× [M (MHET ) − M (H 2O )]
m(PET ) × 100 = Degradation(%)
organism-derived proteins would exert stronger adhesion 
for PET. Subsequently, two marine organism-derived 
adhesive proteins, cp52k and mfp-3, were selected for 
evaluation.
After successful display of INPNC-cp52k and INPNC-
mfp in E. coli BL21(DE3) using INPNC as an anchor pro -
tein, the adhesion ability of the engineered E. coli cells 
with PET was examined. As shown in Fig.  2A, the num -
ber of bacterial cells displaying either cp52k or mfp-3 on 
PET sheets was more than that of the cells without adhe -
sive proteins. Meanwhile, CFU was counted to quantify 
the cells adhering to PET sheets (Fig.  2B). Under such 
conditions, the cell numbers for control, cp52k and 
mfp-3 were 8.9  ×   106, 1.1  ×   107 and 1.4  ×   107 per  cm2. 
Comparted to E. coli cells without adhesive proteins, the 
display of mfp-3 showed a 50% increase of adhering cell 
number.
Sole‑display of Fast‑PETase on the surfaces of E. coli cells
Subsequently, Fast-PETase  (PETaseS121E/D186H/R224Q/
N233K/R280A , Lu et al. 2022) was displayed on the surfaces 
of E. coli cells through another anchor protein AIDA-I, 
an E. coli adhesin widely used for the display of recom -
binant proteins (Lattemann et  al. 2000) (Fig.  3A, C), 
generating a sole-display strain. The displayed whole 
cells exhibited hydrolytic activity towards PET (Addi -
tional file  1: Fig. S1). Meanwhile, to compare display 
efficiency, different anchor proteins, including YeeJ 
(previously used to display IsPETase on the surfaces 
of E. coli UT56002, Gercke et  al. 2021) and OmpA 
(another commonly-used anchor protein in Gram-neg -
ative bacteria, Long et al. 2021) were selected to display 
Fast-PETase on the surfaces. The comparison of PET 
degradation efficiency by three systems under the same 
conditions indicated that AIDA-I is the best anchor 
protein (Additional file  1: Fig. S2). Given the choice of 
more efficient PETase and anchor protein, it was rea -
sonable to expect higher catalytic activity.
Co‑display of adhesive proteins and Fast‑PETase 
on the surfaces of E. coli cells
After separately displaying adhesive proteins and 
Fast-PETase, we attempted to combine the adhesion 
module and catalytic module. To achieve coordinated 
expression of two fusion proteins without potential 
competition, the lac operator in the front of INPNC-
cp52k and INPNC-mfp was deleted for constitutive

expression of the adhesive proteins. These plasmids 
were co-transformed with the plasmid bearing AIDA-
Fast-PETase into E. coli BL21(DE3) to generate two co-
display strains (co-display-mfp and co-display-cp52k). 
The co-display strains were cultivated at 25℃  for cell 
growth and constitutive expression of adhesive pro -
teins. Then, IPTG was added to induce the expression 
of AIDA-Fast-PETase with sequential expression of two 
fused adhesive proteins. Consequently, the expression 
of these fusion proteins was confirmed in the cell mem -
brane fractions by Western blotting (Fig.  3A, B), and 
co-display of Fast-PETase and adhesive proteins on the 
bacterial surfaces was verified by immunofluorescence 
examination (Fig. 3 D).
Next, Fast-PETase displayed on the surfaces of engi -
neered strains was quantified by a grayscale-protein 
concentration standard curve (Fig.  4A–C). As a result, 
in the strain solely displaying Fast-PETase, 70 ng equiv -
alent of Fast-PETase was displayed on the surfaces of 
every 8 mg wet weight of E. coli cells. For the co-display 
strains, 57  ng or 60  ng of Fast-PETase was displayed 
on the surfaces for E. coli co-display-cp52k or E. coli  
co-display-mfp, respectively. Together, the co-display 
of adhesive proteins with a PETase on the surfaces of 
E. coli cells was engineered and confirmed.
PET biodegradation by engineered E. coli systems
To examine the efficiency and speed of our system, the 
rate of PET biodegradation was determined at 30  ℃ for

24  h with E. coli strains co-displaying adhesive proteins 
and Fast-PETase, E. coli strain solely displaying Fast-
PETase and purified free Fast-PETase. Compared to solely 
displayed PETase on cell surfaces, both co-display-cp52k 
and co-display-mfp showed significant increase of PET 
degradation (Fig.  4D and Additional file  1: Fig. S1). The 
PET degradation rate of co-display-mfp in 24 h exceeded 
15%, which was twofold more than that by solely dis -
playing Fast-PETase. Compared to equal amount of free 
Fast-PETase, the degradation rate of sole-display, co-sdis-
play-cp52k and co-display-mfp increased by 0.45, 1.39 
and 2.31-fold, respectively (Table  1), demonstrating the 
advantages of co-display systems.
Discussion
In this study, based on inherited advantages of E. coli 
cells, E. coli whole cell systems were constructed to simul-
taneously display marine organism-derived adhesive 
proteins and Fast-PETase on cell surfaces. The PET degra-
dation efficiency of the co-display systems was significantly 
increased compared to E. coli cells that solely displayed 
Fast-PETase on the surfaces, proving the feasibility and 
utility of co-display approach with E. coli system. Because 
of the use of different PET materials and PETase enzymes 
for degradation tests (Chen et al. 2022; Gercke et al. 2021; 
Jia et al. 2022; Zhu et al. 2022), it was impossible for us to 
make a direct comparison with other reported systems. 
Nevertheless, over 15% degradation of amorphous PET 
in 24  h was the highest value to date. More importantly, 
the present study strongly suggested that simultaneous 
introduction of adhesive proteins and Fast-PETase to the 
surfaces of E. coli cells can effectively promote the process 
of PET biodegradation. Thus, the co-display systems in E. 
coli could be served as a convenient tool for expanding the 
treatment options for PET biodegradation.
According to previous reports (Yoshida et  al. 2016; Joo 
et  al. 2018), the hydrolytic process of PET by free PETase 
generally terminates at the point of MHET release. When 
we used free Fast-PETase for PET degradation, MHET 
accounted for the largest proportion (over 90%) of all deg-
radation products (BHET, MHET and TPA) from PET, 
which is consistent with literatures that another MHETase 
should be involved in the hydrolysis of MHET (Yoshida 
et al. 2016; Knott et al. 2020). Differently, in our sole-display 
and co-display systems, TPA was the major product. Using 
co-display-mfp strain, over 80% of hydrolytic products was 
TPA, suggesting that our co-display systems could accom-
plish more thorough degradation of PET. This newly discov-
ered difference on product profile could be due to favorable 
conformation of the enzyme and/or better contact with the 
substrate in our system, which requires further investigation 
to clarify. Collectively, the present study has provided a new 
treatment option for PET biodegradation, which may shed a 
light on practical applications.
