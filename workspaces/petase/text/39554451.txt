ABSTRACT: Plastic waste is a major threat in our industrialized
world and is driving research into bioplastics. The success of biobased
polyethylene furanoate (PEF) as a viable alternative to polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) of fossil origin will depend on designing effective
enzymes to break it down, aiding its recycling. Here, a panel of fungal
and bacterial cutinases were functionally expressed in a tandem yeast
expression system based on Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Pichia
pastoris. The activity of the enzyme panel was tested with soluble
PEF model scaffolds, observing a correlation with the degradation of
real PEF powder. A high-throughput colorimetric screening assay
based on the PEF scaffold diethyl furan-2,5-dicarboxylate was developed, establishing the basis for future directed evolution
campaigns of PEFases.
■
INTRODUCTION
The development of sustainable materials is essential to
mitigate current environmental challenges, particularly in
relation to global plastics use. Among the emergent bioplastics
that could replace those derived from fossil sources, poly-
ethylene furanoate (PEF) is a clear frontrunner, as it has
comparable physicochemical characteristics to the widely used
polyethylene terephthalate (PET),
1
whose annual production
surpassed the 75 million metric tons in 2015, becoming the
second most produced plastic after polyethylene (PE).
2
Despite the fact that PEF surpasses PET in several environ-
mental and technical aspects, PEF-based materials are not
commercially available as of today, circumscribing its
production to pilot plant scale at most. Unlike petroleum-
based PET, PEF is produced through the copolymerization of
2,5-furandicarboxylic acid (FDCA) and monoethylene glycol,
both of which are derived from renewable biomass.
2
PEF is
roughly 30 times less permeable to CO
2
than PET and is a very
resilient material that boasts high-performance melting and
glass transition temperatures, features that contribute to its
enhanced mechanical properties in various applications such as
packaging and textile production.
3,4
However, the successful
implementation of PEF as an alternative to PET depends not
only on its renewable sourcing, but also on the establishment
of a closed-loop circular economy. Despite being a biobased
polymer, PEF biodegradation is not straightforward. Studies
into its degradation have focused on industrial composting,
conditions under which PEF is broken down after approx-
imately 1 year. Nonetheless, there have been few environ-
mental tests on PEF, and hence, little is known about its
natural depolymerization. Accordingly, at present, the end-of-
life management of PEF relies on chemical and mechanical
recycling.
5,6
Enzyme biotechnology may play a pivotal role in the
comprehensive management of PEF.
7
Indeed, the use of
depolymerizing enzymes could considerably relax the bottle-
neck in the degradation of this biopolymer, while allowing
more precise control over the recovery of valuable by-
products.
8
The few available studies into PEF degradation
have predominantly focused on the use of cutinases (EC
3.1.1.74), a group of enzymes that catalyze the breakdown of
cutin, a waxy biopolymer of plant cuticles. In particular,
cutinases from Humicola insolens (HiC) and Thermobif ida
cellulosilytica (Thc_cut1) can degrade PEF both in amorphous
materials and thin films with varying crystallinities.
9,10
PETase,
an aromatic polyesterase from Ideonella sakaiensis (recently
renamed as Piscinibacter sakaiensis) that is involved in PET
depolymerization, was also shown to degrade PEF, as well as
its related variant FAST PEtase.
11,12
Along these lines, the leaf
and branch compost cutinase (LCC) has proved to degrade
PEF with high efficacy.
12
While these enzymes show some
promise in the degradation of PEF and its related bioplastics,

fine-tuning their properties by protein engineering could
convert them into more efficient industrial “PEFases”.
Directed evolution currently represents the most efficient
and versatile way to engineer proteins, permitting the rapid
optimization of enzymes by mimicking natural evolution in a
test tube and generating superior biocatalysts that dramatically
outperform their natural counterparts. While significant
endeavors have focused on the engineering of enzymes to
meet the demanding operational conditions for PET
degradation and recycling,
13−16
the field of PEF-degrading
enzymes remains relatively unexplored. Here, we analyzed a
variety of potential PEF depolymerases with a view to setup a
directed evolution platform for PEF degradation. The panel of
enzymes, comprising fungal and bacterial hydrolases, was
expressed in the tandem yeast expression system (Saccha-
romyces cerevisiae/Pichia pastoris), benchmarking their func-
tional expression and hydrolytic activity with different p-
nitrophenol derivatives esters. The enzyme panel was tested
with soluble PEF scaffolds, representative of structural motives
of the polymer, as well as with real PEF powder, while a
colorimetric high-throughput screening (HTS) assay for
directed evolution was validated. Taken together, these results
will enable us to perform laboratory evolution in a search for
improved PEF depolymerases.

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Enzyme Panel and Initial Biochemical Character-
ization. The primary objective of this study was to validate a
colorimetric HTS assay for enzymatic PEF degradation based
on PEF soluble scaffolds. Accordingly, we opted to benchmark
a diverse array of bacterial and fungal cutinases to showcase the
broad applicability of this method to any enzyme with PEF
degrading capabilities. Based on previous studies on plastic
degradation, seven well-known hydrolytic enzymes were
selected to form a panel of bacterial and fungal hydro-
lases,
9−11,12,17−25
Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1.
Among the fungal hydrolases, we selected the cutinases from
Fusarium solani (FsC), Cryptococcus sp. (CC), Thielavia
terrestris (TtC), and Humicola insolens (HiC), which display
a wide spectrum of plastic degradation activity. As bacterial
hydrolases, we included a PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis
(PETase), Leaf and Branch Compost cutinase (LCC), and
cutinase 1 from Thermobif ida cellulosilytica (ThC_cut1). Of
this repertoire of enzymes, HiC, PETase, LCC, and ThC_cut1
have already shown PEF degrading activity.
9−11,12
As described in previous studies with fungal ligninases
26
(and references therein), we introduced this set of enzymes
into a tandem-yeast secretion system, based on Saccharomyces
cerevisiae (a suited host for mutant library construction and
laboratory evolution), and on Komagataella phaf f ii − Pichia
pastoris − (appropriate host for overproduction in a fed-batch
bioreactor). Among the main advantages of yeast production
systems vs bacterial counterparts are the ease of secretion of
foreign proteins to the extracellular medium together with
sophisticated eukaryotic machinery to perform complex
posttranslational modifications, including N and C-terminal
processing and glycosylation. The latter is of special interest to
provide recombinant enzymes with improved stability, albeit it
may complicate biochemical characterization in those cases
where hyperglycosylation and/or different glycoforms arise.
After cloning the enzymes in our tandem-yeast secretion
platform, the selected hydrolases were produced by P. pastoris
and purified to homogeneity in order to benchmark the
enzyme panel. Initially, an array of commercial p-nitrophenol
derivatives was used to evaluate the general hydrolytic activity
and functional expression levels of each enzyme. These
compounds included p-nitrophenyl esters with alkyl radicals
of increasing length (i.e., p-nitrophenyl butyrate (p-NPB), p-
nitrophenyl octanoate (p-NPO), p-nitrophenyl dodecanoate
(p-NPD), and p-nitrophenyl palmitate (p-NPP)), as well as
those with bulkier branched (p-nitrophenyl trimethylacetate
(3MA)) and aromatic (p-nitrophenyl benzoate (p-NPBZ))
functional groups. All the enzymes were expressed up to the g/
L scale in the fed-batch bioreactor being active to a greater or
lesser extent with the different esters (Figure 1).

screening assays have been reported to date.
27
These methods
rely on laborious techniques such as embedding of fluorogenic
probes in the polymer,
28,29
microfluidics, or are just dependent
on cascade reactions that impede the continuous monitoring of
the reaction.
30−32
In other cases, they are based on the release
of terephthalic acid
33,34
and consequently not applicable to
PEF. Screening methods employing the solid polymer have
been also developed,
15,35
which in the case of PEF would
translate into additional steps of chemical synthesis, character-
ization and more challenging scalability due to lower
homogeneity and limited enzymatic activity. Aiming for a
faster and more sensitive method, we selected two soluble
scaffolds that are components of the PEF matrix as potential
surrogate substrates: dimethyl furan-2,5-dicarboxylate (2M-
FDCA) and diethyl furan-2,5-dicarboxylate (2E-FDCA).
Soluble PEF model scaffolds offer significant advantages for
enzyme activity assays. Their high solubility in water allows for
the creation of homogeneous reaction mixtures, while their
well-defined structure ensures consistent and reliable activity
measurements. This ease of use and scalability make them ideal
for high-throughput screening applications.
We first monitored the stepwise hydrolysis of these
molecules by HPLC with most of the enzymes of the panel
showing activity on these compounds. Indeed, enzymatic
activity on 2M-FDCA and 2E-FDCA released methyl furan-
2,5-dicarboxylate (1E-FDCA) and ethyl furan-2,5-dicarbox-

ylate (1M-FDCA), respectively, which were converted to
FDCA upon further hydrolysis, Scheme 1.
Since both molecules were susceptible to hydrolysis, we
opted to proceed with the 2E-FDCA due to its closer
resemblance to the PEF structural motif. In order to validate
the use of this soluble scaffold as a surrogate substrate for PEF-
degrading activity, we measured the activity of the enzyme
panel with both 2E-FDCA and real PEF powder, Figure 2.
FsC, TtC, and CC hardly showed hydrolytic action. By
contrast, LCC, PETase, ThC_cut1, and HiC did hydrolyze
both 2E-FDCA and PEF, with a general good correlation.
In order to adapt the enzymatic degradation of 2E-FDCA to
a HTS assay, one potential approach could involve coupling
the release of ethanol to an alcohol dehydrogenase, enabling
the measurement of NAD
+
consumption at 340 nm.
36
Aiming
for a rapid and less expensive method, we opted for the use of
pH indicators, as it has been effectively and successfully
exemplified by Beech et al.
37
for the PET diester moiety
BHET. In our case, the HTS assay would be based on the
release of acidic species from 2E-FDCA after enzymatic attack.
Since α/β hydrolases usually exhibit stronger activity under
alkaline conditions,
38
the hydrolytic reaction was set at pH 8.0
using phenol red as pH indicator and EPPS as a buffer of
choice due to their close pK
a
values. Phenol red undergoes a
gradual transition from red (λ
max
= 550−560 nm) to yellow
(λ
max
= 430−450 nm) as the media acidifies, with linear
responses obtained in the range from pH 8.2 to 6.8. Thus, the
acidification resulting from the hydrolysis of 2E-FDCA can be

easily measured as it corresponds to a decrease in absorbance
at 560 nm.
39
The effect of different EPPS concentrations (from
1 to 5 mM) was studied with increasing concentrations of
FDCA (i.e., mimicking the proton release upon 2E-FDCA
enzymatic hydrolysis), Figure 3.
As expected, we found the assay to be more sensitive at
lower buffer concentrations, with the steepest slope at 1 mM
EPPS, albeit at the cost of saturating the signal at low [H
+
]
concentrations. Higher buffer concentrations also produced
good linear correlations, roughly up to 2 mM FDCA. Based on
the 2E-FDCA enzymatic degradation rate, 2 mM EPPS was
considered a reasonable compromise between sensitivity and
accuracy for this assay.
To validate the HTS assay, we followed the enzymatic
hydrolysis of 2E-FDCA over time and with increasing
concentrations of the enzyme, Figure 4. A strong correlation
was evident between the enzyme concentration and the
colorimetric signal. Moreover, the assay was very sensitive,
with a limit of detection (Δ
Abs
≈ 0.02) and a limit of
quantification (Δ
Abs
≈ 0.01), which should guarantee accurate
screening of mutant libraries. Finally, to confirm the fidelity of
our assay, initial turnover rates were measured and compared
to those obtained by HPLC. Pleasingly, results were very
similar regardless of the method (colorimetric or HPLC) used,
as shown in Figure 5.

CONCLUSIONS
Employing sustainable materials is fundamental to addressing
the challenges presented worldwide from the use of plastics.
Among the biobased plastics currently available that can be
hydrolyzed, PEF is an attractive candidate to replace
petroleum-based PETs due to the similarity in their
physicochemical traits, making it a compelling opportunity in
various industrial sectors. However, despite its origin from
biomass, PEF is highly recalcitrant, and there is an urgent need
for a robust enzymatic method to guarantee its complete
degradation and recycling. Here, we studied several potential
PEF degrading enzymes while setting up a platform that
leverages a tandem yeast-expression system and a screening
assay to perform directed evolution. With these tools, the
engineering of a robust, active, and stable PEFase could be

PEF Synthesis. PEF synthesis was carried out as previously
described by Pellis et al.

Following the protocol that involves
the dissolution of the synthesized polymer in TFA and its
precipitation in water, a white powdery polymer with a high
molecular weight was obtained.

°C and 150 RPM. Proteins were subsequently removed using
ice-cold methanol precipitation.
41
Then, samples were
centrifuged at 12700 RPM at 0 °C for 15 min. The resulting
supernatant was acidified by adding 10 μL of 6 M HCl and
then transferred to HPLC vials. Released products were
analyzed by reverse high-performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC; 3000 Series, Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA)
coupled with a UV DAD detector and equipped with a
poroshell C-18, Agilent). Twenty μL of samples were injected
and run using a CH

O linear gradient at a flow rate of
0.35 mL/min keeping the column at 40 °C and detection at
260 nm. The retention time of the target compound (FDCA)
was determined by injecting a standard solution of the known
compound and comparing the elution times of the target
analyte to the standard. A series of standard solutions
containing known concentrations of the target compounds
were prepared in the range from 0 to 5 mM for each analyte.
Blank reactions were carried out in a buffer. All reactions were
performed in triplicate.
2E-FDCA Hydrolysis Reactions and HPLC Analysis.

were carried out at 30 °C for 5 h. Depolymerization rates were
followed over time, analyzing samples every 30 min by reverse
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC; Shimadzu
LC-2050C-3D), equipped with an InfinityLab Poroshell 120
EC-18 column (150 mm × 4.6 mm, 4 μm) and a photodiode
array (PDA). Ten μL of samples were injected and run in
isocratic mode with 1% (v/v) TFA in CH

OH/H
2
O (4:6) at a
flow rate of 1 mL/min, keeping the column temperature at 30
°C and detection at 240 nm. The injections were performed by
an autosampler. The retention times of the target compounds
were determined by injecting standard solutions of the known
compounds and comparing the elution times of the target
analytes with those of the standards. We employed a standard
curve method to quantify the target analyte concentration in
our samples. A series of standard solutions containing known
concentrations of the target compounds were prepared with a
range of 0.1 to 5 mM for each analyte. Blank reactions were
carried out in buffer. For each concentration level, triplicate
injections were made to ensure precision.
HTS Colorimetric Assay. EPPS buffer, pH 8.0, was
evaluated at several concentrations (1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 mM)
versus increasing FDCA concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4,
0.5, 1, 1.5, and 2 mM). In order to mimic the enzymatic
reaction, increasing FDCA concentrations were compensated
with either 2E or 2M-FDCA decreasing concentrations (2, 1.9,
1.8, 1.7, 1.6, 1.5, 1, 0.5, and 0 mM). Enzyme validation
(linearity and sensitivity tests) and depolymerization rate
calculations were performed in 96-well plate (Standard, Flat
Base, Sarstedt, Germany) with 180 μL of working solution per
well containing 20 μL of 2E-FDCA, 20 mM (dissolved in
100% DMSO v/v), 20 μL of phenol red, 0.05 mM (dissolved
in 2 mM EPPS buffer pH 8.0), and 140 μL of 2 mM EPPS
buffer, pH 8.0. Reactions started by adding up to 20 μL of
enzyme and were incubated at 30 °C and 220 RPM (Minitron-
Infors, Biogen, Spain) for 5 or 30 min (for linearity and time
course reaction experiments, respectively). Color development
was monitored in a plate reader at 560 nm (SpectraMax ABS
Plus, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA).
