ABSTRACT
More than 10 % of global solid waste consists of poly(ethyleneterephthalate) (PET). Among other techniques, 
PET hydrolases (PETases) can be used to depolymerize this plastic. However, wildtype PETases exhibit poor 
specific activities and insufficient thermostability, limiting their use in depolymerization processes which require 
high temperatures. In 2022, machine learning-aided enzyme engineering of a PETase stemming from the bac -
terium Ideonella sakaiensis ( Is PETase) resulted in a more functional, active, stable, and tolerant variant (FAST- 
PETase). To rationalize the molecular basis of FAST-PETase ’ s improved thermal stability, we performed 
comparative Constraint Network Analysis (CNAnalysis) and Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations of wildtype 
Is PETase (WT-PETase) and FAST-PETase at 30

wildtype enzyme. Further analysis of the backbone flexibility revealed that all mutations of FAST-PETase 
affected these critical regions. Counterintuitively, the in-silico analyses additionally highlighted that the flexi -

C in FAST-PETase, instead of exhibiting increased flexibility at higher 
temperature as would be expected from thermodynamic considerations. This effect was confirmed by physical 
energy calculations, which suggest that temperature-dependent conformational changes of FAST-PETase 
decrease the free energy of unfolding ( Δ G(stability)) and rigidify the enzyme at elevated temperatures 
enhancing stability. Looking forward, these findings might help guide the rational engineering of protein ther -
mostability and contribute to our understanding of the thermal adaptation of thermophilic enzymes.
1. Introduction
To achieve a circular economy, the ability to recycle the growing 
amount of plastic waste is considered to be of high priority. [1] With PET 
accounting for around 12 % of the global solid waste volume (8 % by 
weight), the development of efficient and economical de- and repoly -
merization processes is therefore key. [2,3] One such PET depolymer -
ization strategy is the plastics ’ enzymatic hydrolysis, first reported in 
2005. [4,5] Although several enzymes with PET-hydrolyzing activities 
have been identified, such as esterase, lipase and cutinase enzyme an -
notations, [6 – 9] expensive PET pretreatments are necessary to achieve 
acceptable depolymerizing activities with these promiscuous enzymes. 
[10 – 12] In 2016, PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis ( Is PETase) was 
reported to be suitable for the operation at temperatures between 30 and 
50 
◦
C. [13] However, this enzyme was found to be poorly stable, with 
loss of activities after 24 hours incubation at 37 
◦
C. [14] Since PET 
becomes more accessible near its glass transition temperature (65 – 75 
◦
C), [15] increasing T
m 
and optimal operating temperature of Is PETase 
is desirable. Thus, several enzyme engineering strategies have been 
applied to optimize Is PETase ’ s utility by enhancing its thermostability, 
activity and process conditions. [14,16 – 19] As a result, two stabilized 
variants, ThermoPETase and DuraPETase, were generated, which dis -
played higher thermostability ( Δ T
m 
10 and 30 
◦
C, respectively) and 
activity at elevated temperatures ( > 60 
◦
C) but lower activity when mild 
temperatures (30 – 50 
◦
C) were applied in depolymerization experiments.

further optimized by harnessing a structure-based machine learning 
algorithm, [14] which was combined with combinatorial mutagenesis. 
This strategy resulted in the f unctional, a ctive, s table and t olerant 
Is PETase variant (FAST-PETase) with optimized PET-hydrolytic activity 
compared to wildtype Is PETase, and the previously most active variants 
ThermoPETase and DuraPETase (between 30 and 50 
◦
C). [20]
Recent studies utilizing MD simulations and QM/MM calculations on 
FAST-PETase and PETase with and without a PET substrate model 
suggest that the enhanced catalytic efficiency of FAST-PETase in PET 
degradation is primarily due to two factors: control of substrate 
conformation and transition state stabilization. [21,22] Control of sub -
strate conformation is achieved by the enzyme ’ s ability to induce 
reactive conformations of the PET substrate, which are not found when 
the substrate is free in solution. This pre-organization at the active site, 
particularly at 50
◦
C, optimizes substrate alignment in FAST-PETase ’ s 
active site for catalysis. [21] Furthermore, transition state stabilization 
by FAST-PETase seems to be enhanced through an N233K mutation, 
which locally alters the depolymerases ’ structure increasing the basicity 
of Asp206 and strengthening the interaction with His237. This inter -
action reduces the free energy barrier of the acylation stage 
(12.1 kcal/mol for FAST-PETase vs. 16.5 kcal/mol for wildtype Is PE -
Tase), ultimately accelerating the reaction rate. [22]
In addition to the improved transition state stabilization and the fine- 
tuned substrate binding conformation at 50 
◦
C, FAST-PETase exhibits a 
notably improved thermal stability, with a T
m 
of 67 
◦
C – an increase of 
18 
◦
C compared to WT-PETase ’ s T
m 
of 49 
◦
C. Interestingly, unlike other 
depolymerases, FAST-PETase performs best at 50
◦
C, rather than at 
temperatures near the glass transition of PET (65 – 75 
◦
C). At 50
◦
C, FAST- 
PETase releases more than twice the amount of PET monomers (defined 
as the sum of terephthalic acid (TPA) and mono(2-hydroxyethyl) 
terephthalate (MHET)) in 24 hours compared to ThermoPETase and 
DuraPETase. This improved performance at a specific temperature 
suggests thermal adaptation of the biocatalyst, e.g., that the enzyme ’ s 
dynamic properties have been fine-tuned for efficient catalysis under 
specific conditions. [23,24] In contrast, ThermoPETase and DuraPETase 
seem to rely on structural rigidity to maintain their function at higher 
temperatures, prioritizing stability over dynamic flexibility.
While hydrogen-bonding analysis of WT- and FAST-PETase crystal 
structures indicate stabilizing effects of the introduced mutations 
(N233K/R224Q/S121E/D186H/R280A), [20] the influence of the mu -
tations on protein dynamics is less well understood. Thus, we hypoth -
esized that a more detailed analysis of the underlying protein dynamics 
would provide insights into the molecular basis of FAST-PETase ’ s 
thermal adaptation whilst also enabling identification of novel hotspot 
positions for future enzyme engineering campaigns. In support of our 
hypothesis, Creveld et al. reported the ability to differentiate flexible 
regions which promote unfolding from those with catalytic importance 
by performing MD simulation of cutinase from Fusarium solani pisi . Re -
gions prone to unfolding were identified and proposed to serve as hot -
spot areas for mutations. [25] Targeted mutagenesis of equivalent 
regions in the related Glomerella cingulate cutinase was later shown to 
improve thermostability without influencing enzyme activity. [26] As 
the discussed cutinases are part of α / β -hydrolase family (which com -
prises all currently known PET-degrading enzymes), [27] following a 
similar approach to study unfolding regions in PETase seemed 
promising.
Here, structural dynamics of WT- and FAST-PETase were studied by 
performing both, CNAnalysis thermal unfolding simulations and MD 
simulations at 30 and 50 
◦
C. The simulations indicated a temperature- 
induced stabilization of FAST-PETase, which was confirmed by 
secondary-structure analysis and free energy calculations.
2. Results
2.1. Constraint Network Analysis (CNAnalysis)
Constraint Network Analysis (CNAnalysis) can be used to identify 
variations with regards to rigidity and flexibility at optimal tempera -
tures of homologous mesophilic and thermophilic proteins. [28] Based 
on graph theory, global and local flexibility/rigidity characteristics of 
proteins can be derived from single or multiple protein structures to 
support data-driven protein engineering with the aim to improve the 
proteins ’ thermal stability. [29]
As a first step to analyze flexibility/rigidity characteristics of the 
selected PETase variants, thermal unfolding simulations of a single 
constraint network derived from crystal structures of WT-PETase and 
FAST-PETase (PDB accessions 5XJH and 7SH6, respectively) were per -
formed utilizing the CNAnalysis Web Interface ( http://www.cnanalysis. 
de ). [30] A constraint network refers to a model for which the protein ’ s 
atomic or residue-level structure is represented as a network of nodes 
(atoms or residues) connected by edges, which correspond to stabilizing 
interactions such as hydrogen bonds, salt bridges, hydrophobic in -
teractions, and covalent bonds. Through thermal unfolding simulations, 
a stability map can be derived from the constraint network, which en -
ables the visualization of how rigid contacts are distributed and how 
they are impacted by thermal stress, providing insights into the protein ’ s 
structural stability.
When analyzing the stability maps of the PETase variants ( Fig. 1 ), it 
became evident that while rigid contacts in sequence region 55 – 60 of 
FAST-PETase were weakened compared to WT-PETase, all other 
differentiating regions exhibited stronger rigid contacts in FAST-PETase. 
For instance, rigidity scores of contacts within region 110 – 155 around 
position 121 (-1.8 vs   2.2) and region 200 – 230 around position 224 
(-1.0 vs   1.5) increased for almost all contacts. Interestingly, the region 
surrounding key mutation R280A in FAST-PETase, which alters the 
substrate binding site conformation to allow stronger substrate in -
teractions, [18] also showed more rigid contacts (-0.8 vs   2.0) not seen 
around R180 in WT-PETase.
To further investigate the origin of thermal instability in WT- and 
FAST-PETase, unfolding nuclei frequencies were calculated using ther -
mal unfolding simulations on an ensemble of networks (50 network 
topologies). Unfolding nuclei are weak spots within the protein, which 
can be considered as starting points of the thermal unfolding processes. 
Residues with higher unfolding nuclei frequencies represent weaker 
spots of the protein. Through the prediction of unfolding nuclei, at least 
four potential hotspots for further stability engineering of WT- or FAST- 
PETase toward increased thermal adaptation were identified around 
residues Y69, A82, V107 and M156 ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Regions 
around substitutions S121E and D186H in FAST-PETase displayed a 
considerable drop in the unfolding nuclei frequencies compared to the 
corresponding WT-PETase frequencies. Calculating the difference be -
tween WT- and FAST-PETase frequencies mainly resulted in positive 
values indicating the overall reduction of unfolding nuclei.
2.2. Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations
While CNAnalysis ’ s thermal unfolding simulations offered a 
straightforward way to pinpoint protein regions influencing the rigidity 
and flexibility of WT- and FAST-PETase, molecular insights into residue 
interactions and conformational changes cannot be identified by this 
methodology. To confirm whether protein dynamics influences the 
PETase variants ’ thermal stability, we opted to carry out MD simulations 
on both, the WT- and FAST-PETase, at 30

C and 50

After extensive three-step equilibration (constant volume and tem -
perature (NVT) with restraints, constant pressure and temperature 
(NPT) with restraints, and free constant pressure and temperature 
(NPT)), five separate production runs were simulated for 100 nanosec -

lation systems ( Fig. 2 ). For WT-PETase, all replicates of the 30

simulation system displayed RMSD values converging between 0.125 
and 0.2 nm. RMSD values of all replicates simulated at 50 
◦
C converged 
in a range between 0.175 and 0.325 nm. Unexpectedly, RMSD analysis 
of FAST-PETase revealed an unusual behavior of protein flexibility: 
While RMSD values ranging between 0.175 and 0.3 nm were found for 
all replicates of the 30 
◦
C simulation system, the RMSD values of all 
replicates simulated at 50 
◦
C converged in a lower range between 0.1 
and 0.15 nm. This inverted behavior is also reflected in the radius of 
gyration (Rg) and solvent accessible surface area (SASA). While SASA 
and Rg of WT-PETase were found to be higher at 50
◦
C than at 30
◦
C, 
FAST-PETase consistently displayed decreased SASA and Rg at 50

C 
( Supplementary Fig. S3 and S4 ).
Analysis of backbone root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) further 
confirmed these results, identifying several distinct instability regions 
(IS) for which WT-PETase exhibited significantly higher RMSF values 
during the 50

C simulation replicates compared to the simulations 
carried out at 30

C (IS1 – IS6, Fig. 3 ). In contrast, FAST-PETase showed 
higher RMSF values at 30

C and lower RMSF values at 50

C. This 
opposite behavior becomes evident when comparing the Δ RMSF betwen 
30 an 50

positive Δ RMSF values, indicateing temparture-induced unfolding, 
whereas the negative Δ RMSF in these regions for FAST-PEtase suggest 
increased rigidity at higher temperatures. However, this trend did not 
apply to instability region seven (IS7), which displayed only a slightly 
reduced Δ RMSF compared to the WT. Notably, FAST-PETase mutations 
S121E, D186H, R224Q and N233K are located within or are adjacent to 
these instability regions ( Fig. 3 ).
To further investigate differences in the structures of the 30 and 50 
◦
C PETase simulation ensembles, secondary structures of selected con -
formations (frames at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 100 ns) 
were analyzed for all replicates of WT- and FAST-PETase. At higher 
temperatures, WT-PETase replicates displayed a decrease of α -helices 
and loops/disordered regions while the content of 3 – 10 helices and 
extended strands increased. By contrast, FAST-PETase displayed the 
opposite behavior forming loops and helices at higher temperatures 
while the content of 3 – 10 helices and extended strands was decreased in 
comparison to the 30 
◦
C ensembles ( Supplementary Fig. S5 ). This 
finding was further supported by a quantitative comparison of the 
average α -helix and 3 – 10 helix content in the selected conformations at 
50

increased α -helix content ( + 2.1 %; p = 0.0042) and a decreased 3 – 10

Prior studies hypothesized that additional hydrogen bonding and salt 
bridge interactions contribute to the improved thermal stability of FAST- 
PETase. [20] In detail, interactions of S121(E), D186(H), R224(Q) and 
N233(K) with residues N172, S192, S193, E204 and N233(K) were

using all WT- and FAST-PETase simulations trajectories. Changes of the 
mean bond distances between all identified hydrogen bonding atom 
pairs were evaluated by calculating the differences between the 30 and

C simulation systems ( Fig. 4 , Table 1 ). Overall, hydrogen bond 
distances in FAST-PETase were found to exhibit stronger changes in

presents a selection of bonds from the full dataset ( Table S2 ), focusing on 
those bonds that displayed average distances below 0.8 nm. Although 
these distances may appear quite large for hydrogen bonds (typically 
around 0.35 nm), it is important to note that hydrogen bonds break and 
form dynamically over the simulation trajectory. The hydrogen bonding 
detection algorithm also considers bonds that are only rarely formed.
To further support our hypothesis of a temperature-induced stabili -
zation of FAST-PETase, we calculated the free energy of unfolding ( Δ G 
(Stability)) using a set of physical energy functions (EvoEF1 [31] , 
EvoEF2 [32] and FoldX [33] ) by applying them on the last state of all 
simulation replicates ( Fig. 5 & Supplementary Fig. S6 ). Consistently, all 
methods captured a decreased stability of WT-PETase at higher tem -
perature, while FAST-PETase was found to be stabilized at 50

( Supplementary Table S3 ).
3. Discussion
FAST-PETase, obtained through ML-assisted engineering, exhibits a 
temperature-dependent dynamic behavior which is distinct from its 
parental enzyme. In this context, stability map analysis revealed that the 
strength of rigid contacts is increased in FAST-PETase compared to the 
wildtype enzyme, while MD simulations identified instability regions 
(IS1-IS7) which display a different behavior as a function of the applied 
temperature and the investigated variant. WT-PETase displayed signif -
icantly higher RMSF values in instability regions at 50
◦
C compared to 
30
◦
C, indicative of increased flexibility at higher temperatures. Sur -
prisingly, however, in FAST-PETase instability regions IS1, IS2, IS3, IS4, 
IS5, and IS6 exhibited decreased flexibility at higher temperatures, 
suggesting a temperature-induced stabilizing effect. Importantly, in this 
context, many mutations present in FAST-PETase are within or adjacent 
to the instability regions, suggesting a role in modulating the protein ’ s 
stability and dynamics through the reorganization of hydrogen bonding 
patterns potentially causing the thermal adaptation. For example, key 
mutations S121E and D186H impact the hydrogen bonds between res -
idues E121 and W185, as well as H186 and S193, while the collapse of 
these bonds at 50 
◦
C is compensated, inter alia , by the formation of 
stabilizing bonds between E121 and H186, as well as H186 and S214.
The putative temperature-induced stabilization of FAST-PETase is 
further supported by a secondary structure analysis: While WT-PETase 
displayed a lower proportion of α -helices and a higher proportion of 
3 – 10 helices at 50 
◦
C, FAST-PETase maintains its α -helix content even at 
elevated temperature. Notably, 3 – 10 helices are less abundant in nature 
and constitute only 10 – 15 % of all helices in protein secondary struc -
tures. This type of helix is stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonds 
between the carbonyl group of amino acid n and the amide group of the 
amino acid n + 3. However, the formation of van der Waals contacts and 
hydrogen bonds is less favorable in a 3 – 10 helix and in general, the 
α -helix is considered to be more stable. Notably, 3 – 10 helices are typi -
cally observed as extensions of α -helices suggesting that the 3 – 10 helix 
may serve as an intermediary conformation potentially playing a role in 
the initiation of α -helix folding. [34] Elevated temperatures are known 
to induce such conformational changes in proteins, altering their sec -
ondary structure elements. Thus, the observed structural differences

C likely reflect the varying degrees of structural 
adaptation of the PETase variants to thermal stress. [35,36]
The structural characteristics of a thermophilic enzyme at higher 
temperatures often resemble those of a mesophilic enzyme at lower 
temperatures. [23,24] For instance, MD simulations of adenylate kinases 
have shown similar local mobilities, folding free energy, and enzymatic 
activities in kinases from mesophilic and hyperthermophilic origins at 
their optimal temperatures. In this context, it has been proposed that 
this similarity arises from a shared protein energy landscape within their 
optimal temperature environments. [37,38] Moreover, experimental 
evidence shows that temperature does not only affect enzyme stability, 
but also the distribution of active enzyme conformations. [35]
Currently, however, computational enzyme design cannot yet mimic 
Nature ’ s temperature-dependent conformational finetuning which 
might explain typical characteristics of thermostabilized enzymes: A) 
high stability yet poor activity at high temperatures (e.g. 
PROSS5-PETase [39] ) or B) high activity and stability at elevated tem -
perature yet poor activity at ambient temperatures (e.g. ThermoPETase 
and DuraPETase) [14,16,20,40] . In contrast to other engineered PETa -
ses, FAST-PETase does not exhibit this trade-off, as its stabilization is 
only induced at elevated temperatures, allowing it to maintain both 
stability and activity across a broader temperature range. Notably, 
HOT-PETase, developed through directed evolution, has been reported 
to exhibit activity across an even wider temperature range than 
FAST-PETase and demonstrates best-in-class thermal stability, with a T
m 
of 82.5 
◦
C. Similar to FAST-PETase, mutations in HOT-PETase appear to 
enhance structural stability while maintaining the flexibility of the 
active site, a combination rarely seen in rigorously thermostabilized 
variants. [41]
Looking forward, the design of thermostable and active Is PETase 
variants could be further guided by identifying naturally evolved ther -
mophilic proteins and adapting their binding sites to fit the desired 
substrate through directed evolution. [42,43] Harnessing these types of 
enzymes as starting scaffolds has proven exceptionally successful with 
thermostable cutinase variants (LCC
ICCG 
and PES-H1
L92F/Q94Y
) [44,45]
significantly outperforming both FAST-PETase and HOT-PETase under 
process-like conditions. [46] By learning from these templates, the 
in-silico creation of temperature-adapted enzymes might soon become a 
reality.
4. Conclusion
Our comparative MD-driven study of WT- and FAST-PETase sheds 
light on the thermal adaptation of proteins, specifically highlighting the 
role of flexibility regions and temperature-dependent conformational 
changes that impact both stability and functionality. We anticipate that 
analyzing conformational enzyme ensembles with energy function will 
further improve the accuracy of thermal stability predictions offering 
potential for in-silico pre-screening of enzyme variants. Overall, this 
work not only supports the rational design of thermostable enzymes but 
also contributes to a broader understanding of thermal adaptation in 
thermophilic enzymes.
5. Methods
5.1. CNAnalysis
Thermal unfolding simulations on an ensemble of networks derived 
from crystal structures of WT-PETase and FAST-PETase (PDB accessions 
5XJH and 7SH6, respectively) were performed utilizing the CNAnalysis 
Web Interface ( http://www.cnanalysis.de ). [30] Overall, 50 network 
topologies were used for thermal unfolding simulations. Hydrophobic 
tethers were selected to stay constant during the simulations. Default 
E-cutoffs with initial value   0.1, terminal value   6.0 and stepsize 0.1 
were selected. The stability map was generated analogously but was 
derived from a thermal unfolding simulation of a single network.
5.2. MD simulations
For both variants (WT- and FAST-PETase), side chain pKa values 
were calculated using PROPKA and PDB2PQR server (version 2.0.0). 
[47,48] According to the results provided for a pH 8 and the parse 
forcefield, the residues ’ protonation states were adapted using OpenMM 
Modeller class. The simulations were performed using OpenMM 
7.4.125, on NVIDIA ’ s GPU computing platform CUDA. [49 – 51] General 
Amber force field (GAFF) was used with Amber14. [52,53] Box padding 
of 1 nm was used with a cubic box which was solvated with water 
(tip4p-Ew water model). [54] Protein charge was neutralized, and an 
ionic strength of 0.1 M NaCl was applied. Energy was minimized until 
10 kJ/mole tolerance energy. Two simulation systems were set up for 
both variants utilizing a pH 8 with temperatures of 303.15 K and 
323.15 K, respectively. Langevin integrator was applied, [55] whereby a 
friction coefficient of 1/ps and a step size of 2 fs were utilized. Further, 
long range Coulomb interactions were computed using the Particle Mesh 
Ewald method with a 1 nm nonbonded cut-off for direct space in -
teractions. During equilibration, a force of 100 kJ/mole* Å
2 
was applied 
to restrain the protein backbone. During solvent equilibration, the sys -
tems were simulated for 5 ns with NVT ensemble. Subsequently, Monte 
Carlo barostat and pressure coupling of 1 atm were applied and the 
restrained system was simulated for another 5 ns. Finally, the restraints 
were removed, and 5 ns of free equilibration were performed. With the 
resulting system, a production of 5 replicates `a 100 ns was performed 
under periodic boundary conditions. After every 1000 steps, trajectories 
were saved.
5.3. RMSD and RMSF analysis
To compare the variants ’ flexibility at different tempered systems, 
MDTraj was utilized to analyze RMSD ( Fig. 2 ) and RMSF for all repli -
cates. [56] In the case of RMSF analysis, the average of all replicates was 
calculated. The resulting average RMSF values of the 30
◦
C system was 
subtracted from the according average RMSF values of the 50
◦
C system 
to derive Δ RMSF ( Eq. 1 ). 
Δ RMSF = mean ( RMSF
50
◦
C
)   mean ( RMSF
30
◦
C
) (1) 
Comparing Δ RMSF courses of WT-PETase and FAST-PETase enabled 
the identification of regions for which a) the largest impact of temper -
ature and b) the largest difference between the variants was observed 
( Fig. 3 ).
5.4. SASA and Rg analysis
To compare the variants ’ solvent accessible surface area (SASA) and 
radius of gyration (Rg) at different tempered systems, MDTraj was uti -
lized to analyze every 100th frame of all replicates. [56] The utilized 
python scripts and output files were uploaded to the GitHub repository 
( https://github.com/ccbiozhaw/FAST-PETase_stability ).
5.5. Secondary structure analysis
Dynamic alterations in secondary structure were observed by 
analyzing selected frames (at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90 and 
100 ns) via MDTraj ’ s implementation of the dictionary of protein sec -
ondary structure. [56,57] The average occurrence of the assigned sec -
ondary structures were calculated for each system considering all 
replicates. Statistical significance was investigated via Student ’ s t -test 
utilizing Python SciPy library (version 1.11.3). [58] Python files and 
output files of the statistical tests were uploaded to the GitHub re -
pository ( https://github.com/ccbiozhaw/FAST-PETase_stability ).
5.6. Hydrogen bonding analysis
All hydrogen bonds in which S121(E), D186(H), R224(Q), N233(K), 
P. Stockinger et al.

976
N172, S192, S193, E204 and N233K are involved were detected using 
the MDTraj ’ s Baker-Hubbert hydrogen bonding analysis. [59] To iden -
tify the relevance of the resulting interactions, distances between all 
bonding atoms were calculated for all frames of all simulation systems. 
The interactions were ranked by the highest increase or decrease of their 
mean distances by comparing 30 
◦
C and 50 
◦
C systems.
5.7. Physical energy calculations
The output frames of all simulations described above were saved as 
PDB files which were used to analyze the impact of temperature on Δ G 
(Stability) for the different variants. For this purpose, stand-alone ver -
sions of the stability predictors EvoEF1 [31] , EvoEF2 [32] and FoldX 
[33] were used. To enable batchwise analysis of multiple structures, 
Python scripts were developed ( https://github.com/ccbiozhaw/FA 
ST-PETase_stability ). To ensure compatibility with the respective sta -
bility predictors, library-specific functions were applied to repair the 
PDB files. In this context, the term ‘repair ’ refers to the optimization of 
incomplete side chains of a protein, whereby steric collisions are 
reduced as far as possible. The repaired PDB files were then used to 
calculate Δ G(Stability) using the respective stability predictor 
( Supplementary Table S3 ).
