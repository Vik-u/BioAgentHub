Abstract: Previous reports indicated that self-assembling amphipathic peptide S1v1
(AEAEAHAH)2 significantly enhances the soluble expression, thermostability, and ac-
tivity of the target proteins when fused to them. In order to obtain high-efficiency enzymes
for the large-scale degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET), this multifunctional
peptide was fused to the N- and C-terminus of FAST-PETase, a variant ofIdeonella sakaiensis
PETase (IsPETase), with a PT-linker (TTVTTPQTS) harbored between the target protein and
the multifunctional peptide. Consistent with previous reports, S1v1 increased the solubility
of FAST-PETase slightly. Moreover, it increased the activity of FAST-PETase dramatically.
The amount of terephthalic acid (TPA) and mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET)
released from PET substrate after 24 h of digestion at 50◦C by fusion enzymes bearing N-
and C-terminal S1v1 tag was approximately 2.9- and 4.6-fold that of FAST-PETase, respec-
tively. Furthermore, the optimal temperature and thermostability of the fusion proteins
increased in comparison with FAST-PETase. The present study provides a novel strategy to
improve the depolymerization efficiency of FAST-PETase.
Keywords: PETase; multifunctional short peptide; thermostability; catalytic activity
1. Introduction
Synthesized plastics are widely used in textile, packaging, and bottle producing indus-
tries due to their high durability, elasticity, strength, and resistance to chemicals [1]. On
the other hand, the same characteristics caused serious problems to their natural degrada-
tion [1,2]. Efficient, low-cost, and eco-friendly methods for the degradation of synthetic
plastics are in urgent need considering the increasing consumption and accommodation of
plastics in the environment. In 2005, Muller et al. reported the biodegradation of PET with
a PETase-like enzyme secreted byThermobifida fusca (Tf Cut) for the first time [3]. Since then,
many PET hydrolyzing enzymes were mined and applied to the depolymerization of PET.
PET is by far the most studied artificial polymer in terms of biodegradation [4]. In 2016,
the first PETase was identified fromIdeonella sakaiensis 201-F6 and named as IsPETase [5].
Although this enzyme demonstrated high activity to PET, it is thermosensitive and loses
most of its activity within 24 h at 37◦C. Since PET has a glass transition temperature (Tg) of
76◦C and its depolymerization tends to happen at high temperature, IsPETase is unsuitable
for industrial applications. After the structure and the catalytic mechanism ofIsPETase were
clarified [6,7], intensive studies were carried out to improve its activity and thermostability.
Several outstanding variants were generated, including ThermoPETase [8], DuraPETase [9],
Biomolecules 2025, 15, 888 https://doi.org/10.3390/biom15060888
Biomolecules 2025, 15, 888 2 of 11
FAST-PETase [10], and Hot-PETase [11], etc. FAST-PETase was generated in 2022 through
computational learning. It is capable of depolymerizing untreated, postconsumer-PET from
51 PET products in just 1 week. This enzyme demonstrated great potential in the green
cycling of PET plastics.
However, the high-level expression of IsPETase and its variants, with Escherichia
coli as the host, remains a challenge to date. Native IsPETase is secreted extracellularly
by Ideonella sakaiensis [5]. Therefore, the secretion expression of IsPETase and variants
with E. coli and Bacillus subtilis has been investigated using different signal sequences
and promoters. However, the titers of the target protein were relatively low [ 12–15].
Meanwhile, its intracellular expression with E. coli bearing an enhanced disulfide bond
formation ability was investigated. With an optimized medium, the titer of IsPETase
and its variants reached approximately 1 mg/L [ 16]. Our previous work indicated that
partially glycosylated IsPETase and FAST-PETase, prepared with a combination ofPichia
pastoris heterologous expression system and endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase H (Endo H)
treatment, demonstrated high yield and elevated enzymatic activity in comparison with
the recombinant enzymes expressed with E. coli [17]. In addition, the soluble expression
and the titer of IsPETase were improved when carbohydrate-binding module 66 (CBM66)
was fused to the enzyme [ 18]. These results implied the modification of IsPETase itself
maybe another efficient approach to improve the yield and activity of the enzyme besides
of the optimization of the expression systems. Self-assembling amphipathic peptides
(SAPs) are a class of multifunctional peptides composed of alternative hydrophilic and
hydrophobic residues and can spontaneously aggregate into ordered nano-structures in
solution [19]. S1, with the sequence of (AEAEAKAK)2, is an SAP derived from the Z-DNA-
binding protein of Saccharomyces cerevisiae [20]. It was applied as a fusion tag to increase the
thermostabilities and activities of α-amylase [21] and nitrile hydratase [22]. Subsequently,
the lysine residues in S1 were replaced with histidine residues to gain S1v1 with the
sequence of (AEAEAHAH)2. This artificial peptide fused to polygalacturonate lyase (PGL),
lipoxygenase (LOX), green fluorescent protein (GFP) [23], and ZEN lactone hydrolase [24]
with a PT-linker (PTPPTTPTPPTTPTPTP) among the SAP and target protein. The results
indicated S1v1 was able to enhance the expression, purification, thermostability, and
activity of the target proteins significantly. In the present study, the S1v1 multifunctional
peptide was fused to the N- and C-terminus of FAST-PETase with a PT-linker in the middle.
Consistent with previous reports, S1v1 increased the solubility of the FAST-PETase inE. coli
BL21-CondonPlus (DE3)-RIPL. Moreover, it increased the activity and thermostability of
FAST-PETase dramatically.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Bacteria, Plasmids, Media, and Reagents
For gene cloning, E. coli DH5α was stored in our lab. E. coli RosettaBlue (DE3), BL21-
CondonPlus (DE3)-RIPL, and Origami 2 (DE3) were purchased from TransGen Biotech-
nology (Beijing, China). Plasmid pET28a was stored in our lab. Luria–Bertani (LB) media
were prepared as described in the Manual of Molecular Cloning [ 25]. A PET film was
purchased from Goodfellow Ltd. (ES301445, Huntingdon, UK). The TPA was purchased
from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO, USA). MHET was purchased from Aladdin (Shanghai,
China). p-NPB was purchased from Coolaber (Beijing, China). All other chemicals were
analytical reagents.
2.2. Construction of Plasmids for the Expression of FAST-PETase Fused with or without S1v1 Tag
The ORF encoding FAST-PETase was synthesized by Sangon (Shanghai, China) and
cloned into a pET28a vector through the TLTC method [ 26] to generate the expression
Biomolecules 2025, 15, 888 3 of 11
vector pET28a-FAST-PETase. To facilitate the purification, a 6×His tag was fused to the
C-terminus of FAST-PETase. The recombinant plasmid was verified by Sanger sequencing.
Next, the coding sequence of the multifunctional tag was synthesized and inserted into
pET28a-FAST-PETase through TLTC to generate pET28a-S1v1-FAST-PETase and pET28a-
FAST-PETase-S1v1. A 6×His tag was fused to the C-terminus of the fusion proteins, and
a PT-linker (TTVTTPQTS) was harbored between the target protein and S1v1 tag. The
recombinant plasmids were verified by Sanger sequencing.
2.3. Expression of FAST-PETase Fused with or without S1v1 Tag
To induce the expression of the target genes, the recombinant plasmids were trans-
formed into E. coli RosettaBlue (DE3), BL21-CondonPlus (DE3)-RIPL, and Origami 2
(DE3). The transformants were cultivated at 37 ◦C with continuous shaking until OD600
reached 0.6–0.8. Protein expression was then induced by adding 0.5 mM Isopropyl-β-D-
thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 18◦C for 18 h. The cultures were centrifuged at 8000 rpm
for 10 min, the supernatant was discarded, and the cell pellet was stored at −80◦C for
subsequent analysis.
2.4. Purification of the Recombinant Proteins with Ni-NTA Affinity Chromatography
Cells were collected and resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl; 200 mM NaCl;
50 mM NaH2PO4; 10 mM Imidazole; 5% Glycerol, pH 8.0) with lysozyme at a final con-
centration of 1 mg/mL. Samples were ultrasonicated to break the cells. The crude cell
lysate was then centrifugated at 13,000 rpm for 10 min, and the supernatant was applied
to Ni-NTA beads for affinity purification. The column was washed twice with 2 column
volumes of wash buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl; 200 mM NaCl; 50 mM NaH2PO4; 30 mM Imi-
dazole, pH 8.0). One column volume of elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl; 200 mM NaCl;
50 mM NaH2PO4; 300 mM Imidazole, pH 8.0) was used to recover the target protein. The
sample was then collected and dialyzed with a Millipore 10 kDa cut-off membrane at 4◦C
to remove ions and salts, followed by resuspension with storage buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl,
300 mM NaCl, pH 7.5). The obtained proteins were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen and
stored at −80◦C for subsequent use.
2.5. Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-P AGE)
The samples were separated via SDS-PAGE using 12% ( w/v) polyacrylamide gels,
followed by staining with Coomassie Brilliant Blue R-250. The protein concentrations were
determined using the Bradford kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China); bovine serum albumin
was used as the standard.
2.6. Western Blotting
Protein expression was analyzed by western blotting. Proteins were separated on
12% SDS-PAGE gels and transferred to PVDF membranes. The membranes were blocked
with 5% non-fat milk and incubated with His-tag primary antibody (mouse monoclonal,
ABclonal, Wuhan, China) and HRP-conjugated secondary antibody (Goat anti-Mouse IgG
(H+L), ABclonal, Wuhan, China) sequentially. Both antibodies were diluted 1:5000 in 5%
non-fat milk. Target proteins were detected using a chemi-luminescent HRP substrate
(Millipore Corporation, Billerica, MA, USA) following standard protocols. Original figures
can be found in Supplementary Materials.
2.7. High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) to Analyze the Activity of PETase
To investigate the activity of the recombinant FAST-PETase with or without the multi-
functional peptide, the PET films (GfPET, 6 mm in diameter, 8 mg, crystallinity of 7.3%)
were incubated with 500 nM purified enzymes in 50 mM Glycine-NaOH buffer (pH 9) at
Biomolecules 2025, 15, 888 4 of 11
50◦C. After the treatment, the samples were centrifugated at 13,000× g for 15 min and ana-
lyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (Shimadzu LC-20AD, Kyoto, Japan)
equipped with an InerSustain C18 column (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan (4.6 × 250 mM, 5 µm)).
The C18 column was eluted using solvent A (20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 2.5) and solvent
B (methanol) with a linear gradient from 25% to 85% methanol in 25 min. The mobile-phase
flow rate was set at 0.8 mL/min, and the effluent was detected at 240 nm. Concentrations of
the PET hydrolysis products MHET and TPA were determined using standards of known
concentration. All samples were analyzed in triplicate in each independent experiment,
and the average values with standard deviations were calculated.
2.8. Kinetic Analysis
The KM and kcat values for FAST-PETase and FAST-PETase fused with the S1v1 tag
were determined using 0.25 to 2.5 mM of p-NPB diluted with 50 mM potassium phosphate
buffer (pH 7.5) as the substrate at 50◦C or 55◦C, as described previously [27,28]. Samples
were set up in a clear 96-well plate, with each well containing 200 µL of p-NPB and 2.5 µL
of enzyme solution (40.5 µM). Negative controls (2.5 µL buffer) were set up for subtraction
from the background rate due to non-enzymatic hydrolysis of p-NPB. After initial mixing,
the absorbance of the samples at a wavelength of 347 nm was measured on a microplate
reader (Biotek, Winooski, VT, USA) every 30 s for 6 min [ 29]. Subtracted initial rates
were plotted as a function of p-NP concentration and fit to the Michaelis–Menten equation
(GraphPad Prism 10).
2.9. Thermostability Assay
The thermostability of the recombinant FAST-PETase with or without the S1v1 tag was
evaluated by measuring residual p-nitrophenyl butyrate (p-NPB) activity after incubation at
various temperatures. Purified enzymes were incubated at 4◦C, 28◦C, 37◦C, 50◦C, and 55◦C
for 1 h in 50 mM potassium phosphate buffer (pH 7.5). Following incubation, the enzymatic
activity of FAST-PETase was measured at 50◦C, while the activity of FAST-PETase with
the S1v1 tag was measured at 55◦C, using p-NPB as the substrate. Residual activity was
normalized to 100% based on the activity of the enzyme stored at 4◦C for 1 h, which served
as the reference condition with minimal thermal stress. All measurements were performed
in triplicate, and the average values with standard deviations were calculated.
2.10. Melting Temperatures Assay with nanoDSF
The Prometheus NT.48 instrument (NanoTemper Technologies, Munich, Germany)
was used to determine the melting temperatures. The capillaries were filled with 10 µL
samples and placed on the sample holder. A temperature gradient of 1◦C·min−1 from 20 to
100◦C was applied and the intrinsic protein fluorescence was recorded at 330 and 350 nm.
2.11. Molecular Docking
The structures of FAST-PETase fused with S1v1 tag were predicted with AlphaFold
3 [30]. The structures of FAST-PETase (PDB ID: 7SH6) and S1v1-tagged FAST-PETase were
preprocessed by removing water molecules and adding hydrogen atoms. Similarly, the
3PET structure was prepared by adding hydrogen atoms to study the interaction between
S1v1-tagged FAST-PETase (receptor) and 3PET (ligand). A grid box was defined to locate
potential binding sites on the protein. Molecular docking was performed using AutoDock
Vina 1.1.2, generating multiple ligand conformations. The conformation with the highest
score was chosen for further analysis. Interactions between the receptors and the ligand
were visualized using Discovery Studio 2019 Client software.

3. Results
3.1. Expression of FAST-PETase Fused with or without the Multifunctional Peptide
The multifunctional short peptide S1v1 was fused to N- or C-terminus of FAST-PETase.
A PT-linker was added between the peptide and FAST-PETase. The fusion proteins were
named as S1v1-FAST-PETase and FAST-PETase-S1v1. Their sequences were indicated in
Supplementary Figures S1 and S2, respectively. FAST-PETase and both fusion proteins were
expressed in three E. coli expression strains (Figure 1). The results of western blotting indi-
cated that most of the target proteins were insoluble when expressed in E. coli RosettaBlue
(DE3). The solubility of FAST-PETase-S1v1 was promoted whenE. coli BL21 CondonPlus
(DE3)-RIPL was used as the host while FAST-PETase and S1v1-FAST-PETase remained
insoluble. The soluble fraction increased dramatically when the three target proteins were
expressed in E. coli Origami 2(DE3). Therefore, target proteins expressed in E. coli Origami
2(DE3) were used for further study.

3.2. The Activities of FAST-PETase Fused with or without the Multifunctional Peptide
The recombinant FAST-PETase, FAST-PETase-S1v1, and S1v1-FAST-PETase were ex-
pressed in E. coli and subsequently purified using Ni-NTA resin (SupplementaryFigure S3).
We analyzed the hydrolytic activity of these enzymes in relation to GfPET. The results of
HPLC indicated that the depolymeriziation activity of the fusion proteins was significantly
higher than that of FAST-PETase (Figure 2). The amount of TPA released after 24 h of diges-
tion at 50◦C with FAST-PETase-S1v1 and S1v1-FAST-PETase was approximately 4.2-fold
and 3.0-fold higher than that of FAST-PETase (Figure 2A), and the released MHET was
4.8-fold and 2.9-fold higher than that of FAST-PETase (Figure 2B).

3.3. The Thermostability of FAST-PETase Fused with or without S1v1 Tag
Tm of FAST-PETase, FAST-PETase-S1v1, and S1v1-FAST-PETase were measured with
nanoDSF. The results indicated that the Tm values of FAST-PETase-S1v1 and S1v1-FAST-
PETase were slightly higher than that of FAST-PETase (Figure 3). Consistent with the
increased Tm, FAST-PETase-S1v1 and S1v1-FAST-PETase indicated higher optimal tempera-
ture and thermostability. The optimal temperature of FAST-PETase was 50◦C, while it was
55◦C for FAST-PETase-S1v1 and S1v1-FAST-PETase (Figure 4A). To analyze the thermosta-
bility of FAST-PETase with or without the fusion tag, the target enzymes were incubated
at 4◦C, 28◦C, 37◦C, 50◦C, and 55◦C for 1 h, followed by an evaluation of their remaining
activities at the optimal temperature. After incubation at 50◦C for 1 h, the fused proteins
remained almost full activities while less than 50% of the activity remained for FAST-PETase.
After 1 h incubation at 55◦C, FAST-PETase retained less than 40% of its activity while the
fusion enzymes remained approximately 80% of their activities (Figure 4B).

FAST-PETase, with or without the fusion tag, were set to 100%. Experiments were performed in
triplicate, and standard deviations are indicated.
3.4. Enzyme Kinetic of FAST-PETase Fused with or without S1v1 Tag
The kinetic parameters of FAST-PETase with or without S1v1 tag were investigated
with p-NPB, which is a soluble substrate for cutinase. The binding strength ( KM) and
reaction speed (kcat) of FAST-PETase and S1v1-FAST-PETase withp-NPB were found to be
similar (Table 1). However, FAST-PETase-S1v1 showed a much higher catalytic turnover,
increasing by about 87.3% compared to FAST-PETase and 133.4% compared to S1v1-FAST-
PETase. On the contrary, the affinity of FAST-PETase-S1v1 top-NPB decreased by approxi-
mately 38.6% and 41.9% in comparison with FAST-PETase and S1v1-FAST-PETase, leading
to approximately 35.2% and 64.1% increases in kcat/KM in comparison with FAST-PETase
and S1v1-FAST-PETase, respectively (Table 1, Supplementary Figure S4). It is worth noting
that the chemical characteristics of p-NPB are very different from those of insoluble PET.
Therefore, the kinetic parameters were more likely to represent the cutinase activity of the
enzymes, indicating FAST-PETase’s ability to break ester bonds.

FAST-PETase-S1v1 81.32 ± 5.51 1.22 ± 0.18 66.82 ± 8.25
Note: The experiment was performed in triplicate, and standard deviations are indicated.
3.5. Structure Simulation of the Interactions Between Enzymes and the Substrate
The structures of S1v1-FAST-PETase and FAST-PETase-S1v1 were predicted using
AlphaFold3 (Supplementary Figure S5). The results indicated that FAST-PETase maintained
the same structure regardless of the fusion of S1v1. However, the S1v1 multifunctional
peptide demonstrated very different conformations when fused to the N- and C-terminus.
N-terminal S1v1 was a random coil, while the C-terminal S1v1 was an α-helix. Subsequent
molecular docking of the enzyme molecules was carried out, using 3PET as the substrate
(Figure 5).

Ser-His-Asp triad is labeled green. Tyr and Met in the oxyanion hole are labeled cyan. The substrate
is labeled orange.
The non-covalent bonds were calculated with Discovery Studio 2019 Client software.
The results indicated the functional peptide increased hydrogen bonding between the
enzymes and the substrate, while it decreased van der Waals forces (Figure 6), which
indicated the enhanced catalytic performance was mainly caused by improved interactions
between the substrate and the enzyme.

4. Discussions
Epitope tags, such as Maltose-binding protein (MBP), N-utilization substance A
(NusA), small ubiquitin-modifying protein (SUMO), and glutathione S-transferase (GST),
are widely utilized to enhance the folding of target proteins in the E. coli expression system,
Biomolecules 2025, 15, 888 9 of 11
hence increasing the solubility of target proteins [31,32]. However, there is no universal
standard for the selection of suitable fusion tags since the general mechanism remains un-
known. Therefore, mining novel tags for high-efficiency heterologous expression remains a
research hotspot. A previous report indicated that the CBM66 motif derived from Bacillus
subtilis was able to promote the soluble protein expression and total yield of PETase [18].
Our results in the present study indicated that the S1v1 multifunctional peptide enhanced
the properties of FAST-PETase. However, the sequences and amino acid composition of
these two tags are very different. Moreover, the S1v1 tag demonstrated a very different
structure when fused to N- and C-terminus of FAST-PETase. Therefore, it is difficult to
analyze the effect of this multifunctional peptide on the enzyme. We deduced that S1v1
increased the interaction of the enzyme with the hydrophobic surface of the PET. In the
future, more accurate structure simulation may provide more information to guide the
design of the multifunctional epitope tags.
5. Conclusions
In summary, we developed an effective method for improving the expression and
performance of FAST-PETase by fusing it with self-assembling amphipathic peptide S1v1.
This approach enhances the solubility of FAST-PETase, boosting its catalytic activity and
thermostability, and supports its use in PET degradation. In conclusion, the findings of this
study establish the S1v1 fusion as a valuable tool for advancing enzymatic PET recycling,
with potential for further optimization to enhance the production of other industrially
useful enzymes.
