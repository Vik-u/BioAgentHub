Abstract
Medicines, food packaging, personal care products, and cosmetics extensively use polyethylene terephthalate nanoplastics 
(PET-NaPs). However, they also have harmful impacts on several organs. Betaine demonstrates potent antioxidant and anti-
inflammatory characteristics. Our goal was to investigate the detrimental impact of PET-NaPs on the mouse brain and evalu-
ate the neuroprotective properties of betaine. We allocated 40 completely mature male Swiss albino mice into four distinct 
groups: control group, betaine group, PET-NaPs group, and betaine-co-treated group. Following a 30-day duration, euthanasia 
was performed on the mice, and analyzed tissue samples were obtained from the cerebrum, cerebellum, and hippocampus. 
PET-NaPs resulted in an elevated level of malondialdehyde and upregulated cyclooxygenase-2 and interleukin-1 beta (IL-1β) 
expression while significantly reducing the levels of glutathione and downregulating acetylcholinesterase. The PET-NPs also 
caused significant changes in the histopathology of the brain tissue, and there was a demonstrable rise in the immunostaining 
of IL-1β and glial fibrillary acidic proteins. Consequently, betaine effectively alleviated the negative consequences of PET-
NaPs. Therefore, betaine possesses the capacity to mitigate the neurotoxic consequences induced by PET-NaPs.

typically ranging from a few to several hundred nanometers. 
A nanometer equals one billionth of a meter, three orders of 
magnitude smaller than a micron (Silva 2004). Biodetec-
tion of pathogenic organisms (Edelstein et al. 2000), fluo-
rescent biological labels (Wang et al. 2002), medication and 
genetic delivery (Pantarotto et al. 2003), detecting proteins 
(Nam et al. 2003), probing of DNA structure, the engineer -
ing of tissues (Ma et al. 2003), and cancer deterioration via 
heating (hyperthermia) are all applications of nanomateri-
als in medicine and science. Previous research has shown 
that increased human exposure to nanoparticles leads to a 
wide range of health risks (Sadiq et al. 2011). Nanoplastics 
(NaPs), described as plastic debris with a diameter of 100 
nm (Gewert et al. 2015; Gigault et al. 2016), gather in the 
surrounding environment as a consequence of plastic deteri-
oration by ultraviolet (UV) sunlight and microbial organisms 
(Yousif and Haddad 2013; Song et al. 2017; Wilkinson et al. 
2017), and release directly from electronic items, food con-
tainers (Eleftheriadou et al. 2017), personal care products, 
and fabrics (Contado 2015). Melt-phase condensation and 
solid-state polymerization combine terephthalic acid from 
petroleum and ethylene glycol to synthesize polyethylene 
terephthalate (PET). PET is widely used to produce plastic 
bottles and caps. Researchers have detected it in pharmaceu-
ticals, food packaging, and beverages, including carbonated 
drinks. Researchers have discovered microplastics (MPs) 
in beer (Shruti et al. 2020a) and mineral waters stored in 
glass bottles (Mammo et al. 2020), presumably due to bot-
tle degradation. The worldwide production of PET resin 
in 2020 amounted to 30.1 million metric tons, as Rakesh 
et al. (2021) reported. According to the American eating 
pattern, adults can consume 5 g of MPs per week, as Clere 
et al. (2022) stated. Additionally, the recommended daily 
consumption for PET-MPs is 166 mg, according to Tamargo 
et al. (2022). However, there is currently no available data 
about humans’ consumption of polyethylene terephthalate 
nanoplastics (PET-NPs). Schwabl et al. (2019) conducted a 
prospective pilot experiment that revealed the presence of 
PET particles in human feces, suggesting that these particles 
actively interact with the human digestive system. NPs can 
get into people’s bodies through the food chain (Van Cau-
wenberghe and Janssen 2014), consumption of water (Shruti 
et al. 2020b), inhaling (Chen et al. 2020), and ingestion of 
personal care items (Chen et al. 2020). Inhalation and oral 
exposure are primary entry routes (Zarus et al. 2021). Prior 
studies have demonstrated that the central nervous system 
(CNS) is a favorable objective for MPs (Hu and Palić, 2020), 
and NPs pose a greater risk than MPs due to their propensity 
to accumulate in the brain and traverse the blood–brain bar-
rier (BBB) more readily. Furthermore, studies have found 
that this substance can lead to developmental neurotoxic-
ity and hinder locomotor activity in zebrafish larvae (Chen 
et al. 2017); it also causes behavioral alterations, including 
swimming inadequacy (Pitt et al. 2018), which can reduce 
exploratory activity (Mattsson et al. 2017), as well as inflam-
mation, genotoxicity, and even carcinogenicity (Xu et al. 
2019; Poma et al. 2019; Hu et al. 2021). Researchers have 
reported that nanoparticles (NPs) cause harmful effects by 
producing reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to oxi -
dative stress and the subsequent synthesis of free radicals 
(Barboza et al. 2018; Pitt et al. 2018; Liu et al. 2019). We 
have not yet studied the neurotoxicity of PET-NaPs. There-
fore, addressing this deficiency will have implications for 
the cautious utilization of these particles.
Adding a methyl group to the amino acid glycine forms 
the element betaine. Organs such as the liver endogenously 
produce this substance (Preedy 2015; Day and Kempson 
2016), and fish, beans, and grains also contain significant 
amounts (Zeisel et al. 2003; Ross et al. 2014). This sub-
stance quickly absorbs and functions as an osmolyte and 
methyl donor due to the three methyl groups in its compo-
sition (Kempson and Montrose 2004; Olthof and Verhoef 
2005). Multiple research investigations have shown that 
betaine protects the brain against various poisons (Söğüt and 
Kanbak 2016). Betaine has many pharmacological effects on 
neurons, including antidepressant, antioxidant, anti-seizure, 
and memory-enhancing qualities (Rowley 2011; Chai et al. 
2013; Kim et al. 2013; Kunisawa et al. 2015, 2017; Lin et al. 
2016; Nie et al. 2016). It is intriguing to note that betaine can 
decrease neuroglial activation, which in turn helps protect 
mice against neuroinflammation generated by lipopolysac-
charide (LPS) (Miwa et al. 2011; Amiraslani et al. 2012). 
The potential of betaine to protect against neurotoxicity 
is a promising area of research that could have significant 
implications for the fields of nanotechnology, medicine, and 
toxicology.
Due to a lack of studies on PET-NaPs, our goal was to 
investigate if PET-NPs could trigger harmful effects on the 
cerebrum, cerebellum, and hippocampus of Swiss albino 
mice. Additionally, we investigated the protective effects of 
betaine against the neurotoxicity caused by PET-NaPs. The 
findings of this study could have significant implications for 
the cautious utilization of PET-NaPs in various applications, 
particularly in the fields of nanotechnology, medicine, and 
toxicology.
Materials and methods
Chemicals and reagents
Betaine  (C5H11NO2; Amargain industrial complex, Opp. 
S.T. Stand, LBS, Marg, Khopat Thane Mumbai, Maharash-
tra, India) was obtained from El-Mekkawy Company, Cairo, 
Egypt.
9325Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology (2025) 398:9323–9339 
PET-NaP preparation was performed at the National 
Research Centre, 33 El Bohouth St. 12622, Dokki, Giza, 
12311, Egypt. All chemicals and reagents used were of ana-
lytical grade.
The chemicals that were used in this study including 
TFA, PET, and SDS were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. 
For all experiments, deionized water (Barnstead Nanopure 
Ultrapure Water System) was used.
Preparation of PET‑NPs
Precipitation techniques that had been previously docu-
mented were employed to generate PET-NaPs (Kamel et al. 
2024a, b).
Characterization of PET‑NPs
Transmission electron microscopy
Transmission electron microscopy (TEM; JEM-2100; 
JOEOL Co., Tokyo, Japan) was employed to identify the 
morphology of the synthesized PET-NaPs under high-ten -
sion electricity of 160 kV at room temperature. The pho-
tographs were taken at high magnifications to estimate the 
morphology and diameter of the PET-NaPs.
Particle size analysis of the prepared PET‑NPs
Dynamic light scattering (DLS) techniques (Nicomp-
380ZLS, DLS equipment) were used to analyze the hydro-
dynamic particle size of PET-NaPs.
Experimental animals and ethical approval
We divided 40 mature male Swiss albino mice (obtained 
from the VACSERA animal home in Egypt) into four 
groups, each containing ten mice housed in five cages. Over 
a 30-day period, several treatments were administered to the 
mice, using a gavage needle, including daily oral dosages 
and intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections.
The control group, known as group I, was administered 
distilled water. Kamel et al. (2024a) described the admin-
istration of betaine alone to group II, also known as the 
betaine-treated group, at a 1000-mg/kg body weight per 
day intraperitoneally. Group III, also known as the PET-
NPs group, was administered PET-NaPs orally via a gavage 
needle at a dose of 200 mg/kg body weight per day, follow-
ing the protocol described by Kamel et al. ( 2024b). Group 
IV received betaine at 1000 mg/kg body weight per day, 
followed by PET-NaPs at 200 mg/kg body weight.
The experimental methodologies were employed in the 
Department of Pathology, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, 
Cairo University.
Sample collection and preparation
After 30 days of treatment, mice were anesthetized with 2% 
isoflurane (0.10 ml isoflurane liquid in the internal volume 
of the chamber (1 l)) and sacrificed by cervical decapita-
tion within 30 min. Brain samples (cerebrum, cerebellum, 
and hippocampus) were extracted. Cold phosphate-buffered 
saline (PBS; pH 7.4) was used to homogenize a portion % 
of the collected tissues into a 40% homogenate. These tis-
sue homogenates were aliquoted and kept at − 80 °C until 
biochemical analysis. The remaining tissues were preserved 
in a 10% neutral-buffered formalin (NBF) solution for histo-
pathology and immunohistochemical analysis.
Biochemical analyses
Each gram of brain tissue was homogenized in 5 ml ice-
cold potassium phosphate buffer (50 mM) containing 1 mM 
EDTA using a tissue homogenizer, followed by centrifuga-
tion at 4000 rpm for 15 min, and the supernatant was col-
lected. Reduced glutathione (GSH) and malondialdehyde 
(MDA) levels were determined in brain tissue homogenates 
using colorimetric kits purchased from Bio-diagnostic Co., 
Giza, Egypt, following the manufacturer’s instructions.
Quantitative real‑time PCR analysis for acetylcholinesterase 
(AChE), cyclooxygenase‑2 (COX‑2), and interleukin‑1 beta 
(IL‑1β) genes in the brain
The relative cerebral, cerebellar, and hippocampal AChE, 
COX-2, and IL-1β messenger RNA (mRNA) abundance 
were determined by quantitative real-time PCR (RT-PCR) 
using GAPDH as a housekeeping gene (Noshy et al. 2023). 
Approximately 50 mg of cerebral, cerebellar, and hippocam-
pal tissues was used for total RNA extraction using the total 
RNA extraction kit (Vivantis, Malaysia; Cat. No. AM1924). 
A NanoDrop spectrophotometer was used to determine 
RNA concentration and purity (Hassan et al. 2023). RT-
PCR was carried out using M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase 
(NEB#M0253) (Bashir et al. 2021). For performing RT-
PCR analysis, the SYBR Green PCR Master Mix (Thermo 
Scientific; Cat. No. K0221) was used (Hashim et al. 2022). 
Sequences of primers used are as follows: for AChE, for -
ward: 5′ -CAT GCA CAT ACT GTC CCT GC-3′, reverse: 
5′-CTTT CTT  GAG GCA GGA CGT G-3 (Valuskova et al. 
2017); for Cox-2, forward: CAT  CCC  CTT CCT GCG AAG 
TT: reverse: CAT GGG AGT TGG GCA GTC AT (Atta et al. 
2023); and for IL-1β, forward: 5′-ACT CAT TGT GGC  TGT 
GGA GA-3′, reverse: 5′-TTGT TCA TCT CG GAG CCT GT-3′. 
Each quantitative RT-PCR was performed with three bio -
logical replicates, and each biological replicate was assessed 
three times (Elmosalamy et al. 2022). In each experiment, 
template-free negative controls were included (Hassan et al. 
9326 Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology (2025) 398:9323–9339
2023). The comparative  2−ΔΔCT method was used to calcu-
late the relative transcription levels (Rashad et al. 2018).
Histopathological analyses
Light microscopy
We preserved the brain tissues, including the cerebrum, 
cerebellum, and hippocampus, in a 10% NBF solution for 
48 h after meticulous dissection. Subsequently, the samples 
underwent a series of procedures, including washing, dehy-
dration using ethyl alcohol in increasing concentrations, 
clarification using xylene, and finally embedding in paraf-
fin wax. We prepared 4-mm-thick slices using a rotatory 
microtome. These sections were then deparaffinized and 
stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) for observation 
under a light microscope (Bancroft et al. 2013).
Histopathological scoring We classified and scored the brain 
damage under a microscope in a blinded manner, follow -
ing the methods described by Hassanen et al. (2021). We 
assessed the histopathological lesions and assigned a grade 
and score ranging from 0 to 4. The grading system is as fol-
lows: 0 indicates normal histology without any alterations; 
1 indicates light tissue damage, which is 0.5% or less; 2 
indicates moderate tissue damage, which is between 25 and 
50%; 3 indicates severe tissue damage, which is between 
50 and 75%; and 4 indicates extensive severe tissue dam -
age, which is more than 75%. We quantified lesion severity 
in three microscopic fields per six slices, representing six 
animals in each group.
Immunohistochemical analysis of glial fibrillar acid protein 
(GFAP) The procedure delineated in the work of Stoltenburg-
Didinger et al. (1996) involved detecting astrocyte proteins 
in the hippocampus, cerebellum, and cerebrum using paraf-
fin sections on glass transparencies coated with poly- l-ly-
sine. Sections were treated with xylene and acetone for 10 
min, followed by phosphate-buffered saline, methanol, and 
 H2O2 for 30 min to eliminate peroxidase activity. Two PBS 
rinses were used between immune reagent changes, followed 
by incubation in normal goat serum for 20 min to prevent 
contamination. Samples were incubated with polyclonal rab-
bit anti-GFAP antiserum in PBS, followed by adding bioti-
nylated mouse anti-rabbit immunoglobulin and incubating 
for 30 min to form an avidin–biotin complex.
Immunohistochemical analysis of IL‑1β  Brains were 
extracted and sliced (3–4 µm thick) with a sliding 
microtome. Following an hour of blocking in a solution 
comprising 10% normal goat serum diluted in Tris-buffered 
saline (TBS; pH 7.4) with 0.2% Triton X-100 (TBS-Tx 
0.2%), free-floating sections were incubated overnight at 
4 °C in the same buffer solution with primary antibodies 
against IL-1β (1:100). The sections were rinsed, incubated 
with a biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody, linked to 
horseradish peroxidase, and observed using diaminobenzi-
dine (DAB) histochemistry. DAB exposure time was com-
parable for control and experimental samples. Finally, slices 
were washed entirely in TBS before mounting on gelatin-
coated slides, air-drying, dehydrating in ethanol, clearing 
in xylenes, and mounting with cytosol (Stephens Scientific, 
Wayne, NJ, USA) (Fuentes-Santamaría et al. 2013).
Evaluation of immunohistochemical observations (area 
percent)
We evaluated the sections that underwent immunohisto-
chemical staining using ImageJ. This study used a standard 
measuring frame and a × 400 light microscope to find the 
percentage of immunohistochemical responses in five fields 
from different transparencies within each group. We then 
displayed the results on the monitor’s screen. Regardless 
of the staining strength, we chose regions demonstrating a 
favorable immunohistochemical response for investigation. 
We rendered these areas indistinct in the context of computer 
system measurement using a blue binary hue. We computed 
each specimen’s mean value and standard error (SE), fol -
lowed by a statistical analysis.
Statistical analysis
The findings were reported as the mean ± SE using SPSS 
program version 27. To ensure the validity of the results, 
the data were meticulously analyzed via one-way analysis 
of variance (ANOVA), which was followed by the LSD post 
hoc test. A P value below 0.05 was deemed to indicate sta-
tistical significance.
Results
Characterization of PET‑NaPs
Determination of PET‑NaP morphology by TEM
TEM at high magnifications examined the synthesized PET-
NPs to observe the particle morphology, as shown in Fig. 1. 
Polyethylene terephthalate nanoparticles (PET-NaPs) have a 
symmetrical morphology, characterized by an average diam-
eter of around 83 nm. In addition, TEM pictures show that 
the PET-NPs do not form particle aggregates or agglomer -
ates. Instead, they consist of uniformly distributed particles 
of the same size.
9327Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's Archives of Pharmacology (2025) 398:9323–9339 
Determination of PET‑NaP size
DLS was also utilized to measure the average hydrody -
namic size of the synthesized polystyrene nanoplastics 
(PS-NaPs), which revealed that they have an average size 
of 50.75 nm and a polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.542 
(Fig.  2).
Biochemical investigations
Oxidative stress biomarkers
We used the levels of GSH and MDA to detect oxidative 
stress indicators in brain tissue. The administration of 
PET-NaPs resulted in oxidative stress in the brain tissue, 
as evidenced by a substantial reduction in GSH levels and 
an increase in MDA levels compared to the control group 
(P ≤ 0.05). Figure 3 shows that adding betaine improved the 
oxidative stress caused by PET-NaPs. This was achieved by 
significantly increasing the levels of GSH and decreasing 
the levels of MDA compared to the group treated with PET-
NaPs alone (P ≤ 0.05).
Quantitative real‑time PCR
mRNA relative expression of AChE gene  The administra-
tion of PET-NaPs resulted in a significant decrease in AChE 
expression in the cerebrum, cerebellum, and hippocampus. 
The downregulation was 0.29-fold, 0.22-fold, and 0.16-fold, 
respectively, compared to the control group (P  ≤ 0.05). As 
shown in Fig.  4, giving betaine simultaneously increased 
the expression of AChE in the cerebrum, cerebellum, and 
hippocampus.
mRNA relative expression of some inflammation‑related 
genes (COX‑2 and IL‑1β)  Findings in Fig. 5A demonstrated 
that PET-NaPs significantly increased the expression of the 
COX-2 gene. The fold increase in expression was 8.43, 7.47,

and 9.03 in the cerebrum, cerebellum, and hippocampus, 
respectively, compared to the control group (P ≤ 0.05). The 
addition of betaine resulted in a considerable decrease in 
the mRNA expression of the COX-2  gene in the cerebral, 
cerebellar, and hippocampal tissues.
The expression of IL-1β was considerably increased in the 
group treated with PET-NaPs. The increase was 10.25-fold 
in cerebral tissue, 8.70-fold in cerebellar tissue, and 12.11-
fold in hippocampus tissue, compared to the control group 
(P ≤ 0.05). As shown in Fig.  5B, there was an apparent 
decrease in the expression of this gene in the cerebral, cer -
ebellar, and hippocampal tissues between the groups treated 
with PET-NaPs and those treated with both PET-NaPs and 
betaine.

II)—showed a standard histological structure when stained 
with H&E. The sections displayed intact normal neurons, 
neuroglia cells, and neuropil. The neurons are round and 
centrally located and have vesicular nuclei with pale baso-
philic cytoplasm (Fig. 6A, B). On the other hand, when we 
looked at brain slices from mice that had been given PET-
NaPs (group III), we saw subpial bleeding and vacuolation 
of the neuropil (spongiosis) (Fig. 6C). In addition, the spaces 
between cells and blood vessels have grown, the organiza-
tion of neurons in the brain’s layers has been messed up, and 
there are deformed, dying, and smaller neurons with darkly 
stained nuclei (Fig.  6D). We studied sections of the cer -
ebral cortex from mice (group IV) treated with both betaine 
and PET-NaPs. The results revealed that betaine positively 
impacted the cerebral cortex affected by PET-NaPs. The 
reduced presence of neuropil vacuolations, pericellular 
spaces, and perivascular spaces indicated partial recovery. In 
addition, most neurons seemed almost expected, exhibiting 
basophilic cytoplasm and weakly stained nuclei. However, 
a few neurons exhibited degeneration and pyknosis, as seen 
in Fig. 6E.
From what we saw, the cerebellar cortex of two groups of 
mice—the control group (group I) and the betaine-exposed 
group (group II)—had a typical structure with three layers. 
There is a molecular layer on the outside with small stellate 
neurons, a middle layer with normal flask-shaped Purkinje 
cells that have lightly stained nuclei and basophilic cyto-
plasm, and a granular layer on the inside with neurons that 
are darkly stained (Fig.  7A, B). In contrast, our research 
reveals the effects of PET-NP delivery on the cerebellar 
cortex compared to the control group. Light microscopy 
of mice treated with PET-NaPs (group III) showed much 
bleeding in the pia matter (Fig.  7C), empty spaces in the 
neuropil, and nuclear pyknosis in the molecular cell layer. 
The Purkinje cell layer was also looked at, and distorted 
and smaller Purkinje cells with squished nuclei were found, 
along with the complete absence of multiple Purkinje cells.
Furthermore, pericellular gaps surround specific Purkinje 
cells. The granular cell layer reduced thickness, as seen in 
Fig. 7D. Group IV showed that betaine improved the effects 
of PET-NaPs on the cerebellar cortex. In the molecular 
layer, there was a notable decrease in neuropil vacuolation 
and nuclear pyknosis. Most Purkinje cells showed normal 
morphology and had vesicular nuclei, with decreased gaps 
surrounding the nerves in the Purkinje cell layer. Further -
more, the granular cell layer had an almost typical thickness 
(Fig. 7E).
The hippocampal slices from mice that were not given 
betaine (group I) and those that were (group II) showed that 
the molecular, pyramidal, and polymorphic cell layers were 
organized in a usual way. Both the molecular and polymor-
phic cell layers displayed normal-appearing neurons and 
neuroglia cells. The pyramidal cell layer had many triangu-
lar neurons arranged closely together, and their nuclei were 
spherical and vesicular (Fig.  8A, B). On the other hand, 
hippocampal sections from mice given PET-NaPs showed 
spongiosis in the neuropil and spaces around blood vessels 
and cells in both the molecular and polymorphic cell lay -
ers. Additionally, there were severely damaged pyramidal 
cells that appeared more diminutive in size, with condensed 
nuclei, and surrounded by spaces near the cells (Fig. 8C). In 
contrast, the injection of betaine combined with PET-NPs 
(group IV) effectively protected hippocampal neurons. The 
molecular and polymorphic cell layers showed a decrease

in pericellular and perivascular spaces, along with neuropil 
vacuolation. Additionally, there was a partial restoration of 
pyramidal cells, which exhibited a nearly standard structure 
and contained vesicular nuclei (see Fig. 8D).
Immunohistochemical analysis of GFAP
We conducted an immunohistochemical examination on 
slices of the cerebrum, cerebellum, and hippocampus from 
two groups of mice: the control group (group I) and the 
betaine-administered group (group II). The analysis showed 
a slight positive (+) immunoreactivity of GFAP in certain 
areas. Animals in group III were only given PET-NaPs. 
Sections from these animals showed strong and widespread 
(+++) GFAP immunological reactivity in the bodies and 
processes of fibrillary astrocytes. In many places, sections 
from mice given betaine (group IV) showed a moderate 
(++) level of immunological expression of GFAP, as shown 
in Figs. 9, 10, and 11.
Immunohistochemical analysis of IL‑1β  Immunohistochemi-
cal investigations showed that the brain sections (cerebrum, 
cerebellum, and hippocampus) obtained from both control 
mice (group I) and animals subjected to betaine (group II) 
did not exhibit any IL-1β reactivity. However, brain slices 
taken from mice treated with PET-NPs (group III) had 
intense staining that indicated the presence of IL-1β. On the 
other hand, brain slices from mice in group IV that received 
both betaine treatments showed a slight immune response 
for IL-1β, as seen in Figs. 9, 10, and 11.
The quantification of GFAP and IL-1β immune expres -
sion is shown in Fig. 12.
The histopathological analysis of the injuries in the dif -
ferent test groups confirmed that betaine protected neurons 
from the harmful effects of PET-NPs, as shown in Table 1.
Discussion
Despite the long history of plastic utilization and its wide-
spread in the environment, limited data about NP toxicity 
in mammals is available. Thus, the current study aimed to 
evaluate the toxic impact of PET-NaPs on mice’s brain tis-
sue following oral ingestion. It also evaluated the protective 
impact of betaine against PET-NaPs-induced neurotoxicity. 
Recent studies have demonstrated that NPs can cross the 
BBB (Grodzicki et al. 2021). Oxidative stress and inflamma-
tion are important in the pathophysiology of NP intoxication 
(Ahmed et al. 2022). As a result, the current study examined

various oxidative stress biomarkers and the mRNA relative 
expression of some proinflammatory cytokines. The primary 
mechanism for NP toxicity is believed to be oxidative stress 
and ROS generation (Ahmed et al. 2022; Yasin et al. 2022).
Our findings indicated that oral ingestion of PET-NaPs 
resulted in a significant increase in MDA levels and a 
decrease in GSH content. GSH is an endogenous nonen-
zymatic cell antioxidant molecule that scavenges and neu -
tralizes ROS. ROS accumulation as a result of endogenous 
antioxidant inhibition causes damage to biomolecules such 
as DNA, proteins, and lipid peroxidation, leading to the for-
mation of MDA (Su et al. 2019). MDA is a reliable indicator 
for lipid peroxidation. The increased levels of MDA and 
reduced GSH found in the present study point to oxidative 
stress induction, which can contribute to PET-NaPs-induced 
brain damage. NaPs may cause cells to make too many ROS, 
which may lead to changes in metabolic processes like oxi-
dative phosphorylation, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, 
the breakdown of fatty acids, and the metabolism of amino 
acids (Ahmad et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2023). Additional 
evidence of brain injury comes from the downregulation of 
AChE that PET-NaPs produced in our study, which provides 
additional evidence of brain injury. AChE is responsible for 
the enzymatic transformation of acetylcholine (ACh) into 
acetic acid and choline (Wang et al. 2025). ACh is a vital 
neurotransmitter crucial to memory, learning, and attention 
(Sun et al. 2015). ACh accumulates due to oxidative stress at 
cholinergic synapses in the central nervous system and neu-
romuscular junctions. This accumulation of ACh can result 
in neuronal dysfunctions, such as increased cholinergic 
activity in the neuromuscular system (Al Olayan et al. 2020).
PET-NaPs triggered neurodegeneration in the current 
study, as evidenced by neuropil vacuolation (spongiosis). 
Additionally, we observed pericellular and perivascular 
spaces in three brain regions, consistent with the findings 
of Elnoury et al. (2013), Wang et al. (2022), Abdelhameed 
et al. (2023), and Yousef et al. (2019). After treating cells 
with iron oxide and silver nanoparticles, we saw changes 
like pericellular edema, blood vessel dilation, and vascular 
damage, resulting in fluid accumulation in the affected area. 
Furthermore, Scott et al. (2008) proposed that the enlarge-
ment of neuronal processes and presynaptic nerve terminals

leads to the formation of vacuoles in the neuropil. Galal 
et al. (2019) suggest that damage to the cytoskeleton can 
cause neuronal atrophy and process retraction, leading to 
the vacuolation of the neuropil. Furthermore, loss of neu-
ronal arrangement in cerebral layers also results in distorted, 
degenerated, and shrunken neurons with pyknotic nuclei. 
In particular, Xu et al. (2021) found abnormal neuronal 
layering and deformed neurons in the cerebral cortex of 
mice exposed to PS-NaPs, which were identified by nuclear 
pyknosis.
The study also found that the cerebellum had subpial 
hemorrhage, nuclear pyknosis in the molecular cell layer,

deformed and shrunken Purkinje cells with pyknotic nuclei, 
and the loss of several Purkinje cells with vacuolar spaces in 
the Purkinje cell layer. Aside from that, the thickness of the 
granular cell layer appeared to decrease. These findings were 
in harmony with Xu et al. (2015), Bashir et al. (2021), and 
Yin et al. (2022). Furthermore, in this study, the pyramidal 
cells of the hippocampus in Swiss albino mice exposed to 
PET-NPs appeared distorted and shrunken, with pyknotic 
nuclei. NPs cause oxidative stress in hippocampal neurons, 
adversely affecting cellular constituents such as proteins and 
cell membranes (Beal 1996; Flynn and Melov 2013).
Yang et al. (2023) suggest that NPs generate neuro-
toxicity through a potential mechanism of neuroinflam-
mation. The current findings demonstrate a significant 
increase in the expression of COX-2 and IL-1 follow -
ing oral ingestion of PET-NaPs. The COX-2  gene is a 
potent biomarker for tissue inflammation, as Galal et al. 
(2014) demonstrated. COX-2 is an enzyme that triggers 
the first stage of generating prostanoids associated with 
inflammatory and immunosuppressive diseases (Liu et al. 
2015). IL-1β is a prototypic proinflammatory cytokine 
that has pleiotropic effects on many cells and is impor -
tant in acute and chronic inflammatory and autoimmune 
diseases. Overproduction of IL-1β is linked to patho-
physiological alterations in diseases such as rheumatoid 
arthritis, neuropathic pain, inflammatory bowel disease, 
osteoarthritis, vascular disease, multiple sclerosis, and 
Alzheimer’s disease (Dinarello 1996, 2004; Braddock 
and Quinn 2004). IL-1β can be produced by glial cells 
such as Schwann cells, microglia, and astrocytes (Clark 
et al. 2006; Guo et al. 2007; Thacker et al. 2007). Oxida-
tive stress-induced neuroinflammation is related to ROS 
overproduction, which could induce neuronal damage 
through lipid peroxidation of membrane phospholipids 
and degradation of cytoskeletal proteins (Lan et al. 2024). 
This results in the attraction of many microglial cells,

which engulf the necrotic neurons. Microglial cells also 
secrete and activate proinflammatory cytokines such as 
IL (Hassanen et al. 2019). The secretion of IL-1 results in 
the subsequent induction of other proinflammatory genes, 
such as COX-2  (Wang et al. 2023). Moreover, we demon-
strated overexpression of IL-1 in PET-NaPs-exposed mice 
compared to control mice, which was in harmony with 
the findings of Mitra et al. (2011) and Guo et al. (2013).
When brain tissue damage occurs, the cytoskeleton of 
cells increases the protein GFAP (Panickar and Norenberg 
2005). It shows early biological effects connected to changes 
in the shape and movement of astrocytes, cell communica-
tion, synaptic transmission, and the function of the BBB 
(Pierozan et al. 2012 ). In contrast to the control group, the 
mice given PET-NaPs had higher levels of GFAP in their 
cerebral cortex, cerebellar cortex, and hippocampal areas. 
This shows that the PET-NaPs stimulated astrocytes. These 
findings support the findings of Abdelhameed et al. (2023).
Betaine is a promising neuroprotective agent against sev-
eral neurological disorders (Rahmani et al. 2019; Arumugam 
et al. 2021; Li et al. 2022). The neuroprotective effect of 
betaine could be associated with its antioxidant and anti-
inflammatory effects (Medici et al. 2014; Zhang et al. 2016; 
Yang et al. 2017; Arumugam et al. 2021; Hui et al. 2024). 
Our findings confirm orally administered betaine’s antioxi-
dant properties and anti-inflammatory effects by increasing 
GSH content, reducing MDA levels, upregulating AChE, 
and downregulating COX-2  and IL-1 gene expression in 
brain tissue. Researchers have already found that treating 
cells with betaine lowered oxidative stress by raising the 
levels of GSH and antioxidant enzymes like glutathione 
peroxidase 4 (GPx4) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) 
(Rahmani et al. 2019; Veskovic et al. 2019; Arumugam et al. 
2021). Oral betaine treatment also prevents tissue cysteine 
and GSH depletion because it is associated with converting 
homocysteine into methionine, which increases the supply 
of the methyl group required for GSH synthesis (Jung et al. 
2013). Increasing antioxidant levels makes betaine more 
effective at getting rid of ROS, which may be linked to its 
ability to reduce inflammation (Jung et al. 2013; Arumugam 
et al. 2021). Betaine’s ability to reduce the production of 
C-reactive protein (CRP), IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha 
(TNF-α), and IL-1 also contributes to its anti-inflammatory 
effect (Veskovic et al. 2019; Ilyas et al. 2022). Hashim et al. 
(2024) proved that the betaine-co-treated group alleviated 
the overexpression of IL-1β.
Microscopic analysis of brain tissues from mice exposed 
to betaine with PET-NPs revealed a partial restoration of 
the histological structure in the cerebellar cortex, cerebral 
cortex, and hippocampus. Additionally, there was a notable 
decrease in the pericellular and perivascular spaces and the 
neuropil vacuolations across all brain regions. Moreover, this 
treatment resulted in a reduction in neuronal degeneration. 
These observations agreed with Hashim et al. ( 2024). Fur-
thermore, Hashim et al. (2024) noted a significant decrease 
in GFAP immune expression in mice co-treated with betaine.
Conclusion
The present investigation revealed that the administration 
of PET-NaPs causes significant histological alterations and 
oxidative stress-induced harm in mice’s cerebral tissue. The 
generation of an excessive amount of ROS leads to elevated 
lipid peroxidation and the reduction of antioxidant enzymes, 
accomplishing this. In addition, PET-NaPs increase the 
expression of specific inflammation-related genes, such 
as COX-2, IL-1β, and GFAP, while decreasing the expres-
sion of AChE. Conversely, simultaneous administration of 
betaine effectively mitigates all neurotoxicological diseases 
and amplifies the oxidative damage that PET-NaPs instigate. 
We can attribute the observed results to betaine’s potent anti-
oxidant and anti-inflammatory characteristics. Our research 
indicates that betaine has promise as a neuroprotective drug 
for preventing neurotoxicity generated by PET-NaP.
Recommendation and limitation
Our research suggests a potential solution to the harmful 
effects of PET-NPs. If the use of PET-NaPs is unavoid-
able, betaine could be applied as a protective measure for 
individuals and animals at higher risk. Future research 
should explore this possibility further and develop strate -
gies to counteract the impact of PET-NaPs on livestock and 
human health. We propose betaine as a promising neuro-
protective agent that could mitigate the detrimental effects 
of PET-NaPs.
