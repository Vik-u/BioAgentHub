Plastic pollution has become a global crisis, with microplastics contaminating every environment on 
the planet, including our food, water, and even our bodies. In response, there is a growing interest in 
developing plastics that biodegrade naturally, thus avoiding the creation of persistent microplastics. 
As a mechanism to increase the rate of polyester plastic degradation, we examined the potential of 
using the green microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii for the expression and secretion of PHL7, an 
enzyme that breaks down post-consumer polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics. We engineered 
C. reinhardtii to secrete active PHL7 enzyme and selected strains showing robust expression, by using 
agar plates containing a polyester polyurethane (PU) dispersion as an efficient screening tool. This 
method demonstrated the enzyme’s efficacy in degrading ester bond-containing plastics, such as 
PET and bio-based polyurethanes, and highlights the potential for microalgae to be implemented in 
environmental biotechnology. The effectiveness of algal-expressed PHL7 in degrading plastics was 
shown by incubating PET with the supernatant from engineered strains, resulting in substantial plastic 
degradation, confirmed by mass spectrometry analysis of terephthalic acid formation from PET. Our 
findings demonstrate the feasibility of polyester plastic recycling using microalgae to produce plastic-
degrading enzymes. This eco-friendly approach can support global efforts toward eliminating plastic in 
our environment, and aligns with the pursuit of low-carbon materials, as these engineered algae can 
also produce plastic monomer precursors. Finally, this data demonstrates C. reinhardtii capabilities for 
recombinant enzyme production and secretion, offering a “green” alternative to traditional industrial 
enzyme production methods.

In the twenty-first century, transitioning to a climate-neutral economy is an urgent and critical challenge, 
demanding innovative solutions across all facets of society. Biotechnology, especially through the utilization of 
microalgae, has the potential to play a vital role in this transformation. Microalgae offer substantial environmental 
benefits, such as replacing fossil-based products with products that offer significantly reduced greenhouse gas 
emissions1,2. As a sustainable source for bioplastic production, microalgae provide a renewable alternative to 
petroleum, and contribute to CO2 sequestration, addressing two major environmental concerns. However, these 
microalgal production processes must overcome economic and scaling barriers to realize their full potential and 
achieve broader adoption. This includes making them cost-competitive with traditional methods and ensuring 
their cultivation and processing are environmentally sustainable and efficient3. By addressing these challenges, 
microalgae can become a cornerstone of a more sustainable and climate-resilient future.
Petroleum-based plastics contribute to significant environmental degradation, not only through direct 
greenhouse gas emissions during production, but also by causing widespread plastic pollution after their useful 
life4. Plastics presently account for about 4.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions, with projections showing a 
potential increase in emissions if current trends continue 5. The production of plastic has grown exponentially 
over the past 70  years, from just two million tons in 1950 to over 450 million tons today, attesting to the 
widespread use of plastics in many sectors 6. This increase in production has led to significant environmental 
challenges, reflected in recycling rates of only 5–6% in 2021, actually down from the 8.7% rate of recycling just 
three years prior 7. The rest is either landfilled, incinerated, or mismanaged, with a significant portion ending 
up in natural environments. Unfortunately, between 4.8 and 12.7 million tons of this plastic enter the oceans

yearly, contributing to the growing problem of marine pollution8. This influx of plastics in the marine ecosystem 
is alarming, as it not only affects marine life but also poses a threat to human health through bioaccumulation 
in the food chain9, since it ultimately breaks down into micro- and nano-plastics that can persist for hundreds 
of years8. The continued accumulation of plastics is projected to have long-lasting impacts, with some estimates 
suggesting that by 2050, the mass of plastics in the ocean could surpass that of the mass of fish8.
Various strategies have been pursued to mitigate the pervasive issue of plastic pollution. These include bans 
on single-use plastics like plastic bags, straws, and utensils, and promoting reusable alternatives such as metal 
water bottles and fabric shopping bags. Improving waste collection and recycling systems can also play a crucial 
role in diverting plastic waste from landfills and oceans10. Given plastic’s essential role in applications like food 
spoilage prevention and general consumer goods packaging 11,12, eliminating plastics any time soon seems 
unlikely. However, even today, there are alternatives such as bioplastics, which are plastics derived from bio-
based materials. These bio-plastics offer potentially much more environmentally favorable profiles and some of 
these materials have successfully scaled up to industrial production13.
Nonetheless, these options still contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, mainly due to the feedstock production 
chain and competition with food crops for arable land, water, and energy 14. Some bioplastics are chemically 
identical to their petroleum-based counterparts, posing similar end-of-life environmental problems 15. As a 
result, there is increasing interest in creating bio-based, sustainably sourced plastics that naturally biodegrade, 
helping to prevent the formation of long-lasting microplastics16. In this context, microalgae have been explored 
as a renewable source of bio-crude, capitalizing on features like non-arable land requirements, high productivity 
per area, and scaling feasibility17. Microalgae capture carbon dioxide during growth and can utilize that carbon 
to generate biomaterials for plastic production. At scale, it can potentially align with current plastic industry 
pricing18. The emergence of biodegradable consumer products, such as sneakers made from algae-derived oil, 
showcases the readiness of this technology for bioplastic production 18. To advance the competitiveness and 
adoption of microalgal bioplastics, it is essential to prioritize cost reduction measures, leverage synergistic 
byproduct production for increased revenue, and optimize economic efficiency—all while preserving positive 
environmental impacts.
In this study, we engineered a strain of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii to efficiently secrete PHL7, an enzyme 
capable of degrading post-consumer polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics19. The degradation generates PET 
monomers that can be recycled into new PET plastics 20. As photosynthetic organisms, microalgae efficiently 
convert light and carbon dioxide into valuable biomass and bioactive compounds, supporting a closed-loop 
system from cradle to grave, thereby minimizing environmental impact. Its rapid growth and scalability further 
underscore its suitability for large-scale cultivation. Extracellular secretion of PHL7 simplifies protein purification 
and eliminates the need for costly and labor-intensive cell lysis processes. This feature significantly enhances the 
practicality and economic viability of using microalgae for bioplastic production and other biomass conversion 
applications.
We envision two promising approaches using our microalgae system. The first involves a single-step process, 
where algal growth and plastic degradation co-occur within the same medium, providing a streamlined solution 
for recycling plastic monomers. The second approach is a bifurcated method, separating the algal growth phase 
from the plastic degradation process, which allows for specialized optimization of each step. These methodologies 
open new avenues in biotechnology, presenting microalgae as a dual-purpose solution for mitigating plastic 
pollution while contributing to more sustainable and eco-conscious production of bioplastic feedstock.
Results
We evaluated the capacity of C. reinhardtii CC-1690 for secreting plastic degrading enzymes, using the vector 
pJP32 that employs the ble gene as a selection marker and contains a signal peptide to direct an associated 
recombinant enzyme for secretion. This vector integrates into the nucleus of C. reinhardtii through non-
homologous end joining (NHEJ) following electroporation 21. The recombinant enzyme gene was fused to ble 
gene with a self-cleavage peptide (FMDV-2A) sequence, followed by the signal peptide SP7 sequence, used for 
targeting the protein to the ER for secretion (Fig. 1A). This signal peptide is from a cell wall protein (SAD1p)21. 
The plastic degrading enzyme studied is PHL7, an enzyme isolated from a compost metagenome and identified 
for its potential to break down and recycle polyester plastics, specifically PET 19. To identify colonies capable 
of secreting PHL7, we employed zeocin selection plates containing Impranil (Bayer Corporation, Germany), a 
polyester polyurethane polymer suspension, in two concentrations: 0.5% and 0.75% (v/v). Zeocin is a member 
of the bleomycin family of glycopeptide antibiotics and functions by inducing DNA strand breaks in prokaryotic 
and eukaryotic cells. Resistance to zeocin is conferred by the ble gene, which encodes a protein that binds to 
and inactivates the antibiotic. Colonies on these plates indicated the successful incorporation of the vector 
conferring resistance to zeocin. The capacity to secrete the plastic enzyme was observed by the formation of 
halos (transparent clearing zones in the opacity generated by Impranil) around the colonies, indicating both 
secretion and activity of the enzyme in the area around the colonies. We performed three independent biological 
transformations and recorded the number of colonies and halos (Table 1).
On plates containing 0.5% Impranil DLN, 5110 colonies formed, of which 24.6% (1255) produced halos. On 
the plates with 0.75% Impranil DLN, only 1904 colonies appeared, with 9.3% (178) forming halos. These results 
confirm that C. reinhardtii can secrete active PHL7, as halo formation indicates (Supplementary Figure 1).
We further screened the colonies with halos in a 96-well plate setup. Strains identified as secreting PHL7 were 
in TAP media on 96-well plates for five days. The supernatant was recovered and ester bond cleavage activity was 
determined by measuring fluorescein diacetate (FDA) cleavage activity. To account for native esterase enzymes 
secreted during the C. reinhardtii life cycle22 capable of cleaving the FDA, we measured the parental wild-type 
strain CC-1690 in the same experiment (Fig. 2). A substantial portion of transformants showed increased activity 
compared to the wild-type. For colonies selected from plates with 0.5% Impranil DLN, 40.6% (28/69) had higher

activity than the averaged results (plus three standard deviations) of wild-type. Plates with 0.75% Impranil DLN 
presented 50.9% (27/52) of transformants that exceeded this threshold. An ANOV A followed by a Tukey post-
hoc analysis showed significant differences in activity levels between the wild-type and transformed strains, with 
adjusted p-values of 0.0388 and 0.0441 for 0.5% and 0.75% Impranil DLN plates, respectively (Fig. 2).
In addition to the FDA assay, we explored another strategy to detect enzyme activity using agarose gels 
supplemented with Impranil DLN inside 96-well plates (Supplementary Figure 2). Impranil DLN absorbs strongly 
in the near UV region (~ 350 nm) (Supplementary Figure 3), and we monitored the decrease in absorption as a 
proxy for substrate degradation (Supplementary Figure 2). Both methods were functional: FDA had a quicker 
turnaround (~ 40 min), while the Impranil DLN-based assay required several hours (> 12 h).
The Impranil DLN activity assay revealed distinct differences in activity levels between the wild-type and 
pJP32PHL7 candidate colonies (Fig.  2). As expected, the wild-type strain exhibited a narrow distribution of 
activity values, with all values clustering below the threshold line. The threshold line was calculated as three 
standard deviations above the mean wild-type baseline activity level. In contrast, the pJP32PHL7 colonies show a 
broader distribution of activities, with several values exceeding the threshold, indicating the presence of positive 
strains (Fig. 2). This Impranil DLN activity assay identified 30% positive transformants (25/84).
After the supernatant was used to detect enzyme activity, we blotted the 84 colony cultures onto agar plates 
containing 0.5% or 0.75% Impranil DLN as a quality control step to confirm the retention of the halo-forming 
phenotype (Supplementary Figure 4). Halo formation was observed in 81 colonies from the 0.5% plates and 83 
colonies from the 0.75% plates, with the absence of halos in three colonies from the 0.5% plates likely due to 
sampling errors or false positives in densely populated regions on the selection plates. A time-lapse video (Video 
1) demonstrates halo formation around cell patches on TAP agar plates containing 0.5% Impranil DLN and 
15 µg/mL zeocin. Zeocin, a glycopeptide antibiotic from the bleomycin family, induces DNA strand breaks in 
prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The observed halo formation confirms the secretion of PHL7, while sustained 
cell growth verifies the maintenance of bleomycin resistance.
The highest-producing strain from the screenings was selected and expanded, and its supernatant was used 
to run a zymogram containing Impranil DLN (Fig. 3C). We initially observed the presence of two clearing zones

on the protein gels, indicating the presence of two isoforms of the enzyme being produced by C. reinhardtii in 
the pJP32PHL7 strain, which we assumed was due to post-translational modifications (PTMs) occurring in the 
secretory pathway. We confirmed the presence of PHL7 in both cleared regions by mass spectrometry-assisted 
protein sequencing. We identified the presence of 9 and 11 PHL7 peptides from the top and bottom bands, 
respectively. In silico protein sequence analysis using NetN-Glyc-1.0 indicated one possible explanation for 
the two isoforms (Supplementary Figure 5). The sequence holds three possible glycosylation sites, two of them 
juxtaposed, possibly explaining the two isoforms detected, one with one residual glycosylated and the other 
with both positions glycosylated. To confirm that glycosylation is the likely PTM being performed on PHL7, we 
prepared a new PHL7 version (PHL7dg), replacing the asparagine residues on the predicted glycosylation sites 
with aspartic acid (Supplementary Figure 5).
The new vector containing the non-glycosylated PHL7 was transformed and generated several colonies, with 
a few presenting halos (Supplementary Figure 6). We selected one of the colonies from the single transformation 
event to grow in a flask. We performed a zymogram alongside the original sequence (Fig.  3C). We observed a 
downshift in the band position in the gel, indicating an absence of the PTM observed in the original unmodified 
enzyme.
We compared the growth performance of the top producer pJP32PHL7 strain to the wild-type parental 
CC-1690 strain (Fig.  4). Both strains grew similarly without any observable difference in growth rate between 
the wild-type and recombinant strains, with a slightly lower stationary phase density for the PHL7 strain. The 
secretion of PHL7 enzymes was measured by changes in OD at 350 nm due to enzymatic degradation of Impranil 
DLN (Fig.  4). The production curve demonstrated that the top producer pJP32PHL7 strain started to secrete 
detectable levels of enzymes on approximately day 5 of cultivation, coinciding with the onset of the stationary 
phase (Fig.  4). The secretion of PHL7 enzymes exhibited a continual rise throughout the stationary phase, as 
evidenced by the downward trend observed after day 4 (Fig.  4). Linear regression analysis of the PHL7 strain 
after day 4 demonstrated a significant downward trend in slope values over time (p value = 0.011), while the wild-
type results remained stable. The downward trend indicates an increased accumulation of active enzymes in the 
supernatant. A decrease or stabilization in enzymatic content was not observed within the timeframe studied, 
and any residual PHL7 retained within the cells was not assessed.

To demonstrate that PHL7 produced by C. reinhardtii can degrade PET plastic, in addition to degrading 
the Impranil polyurethane, we incubated a concentrated supernatant sample from the PHL7 strain, and a wild-
type control, with approximately 30 mg of PET powder (> 50% crystallinity) for seven days at 68 °C in 500 mM 
phosphate buffer (pH 8) (Fig.  5). The reaction was monitored by measuring the absorbance at 240 nm, while 
tracking the formation of terephthalic acid (TPA), a degradation product of PET19. A sharp increase in absorbance 
was observed on the first day, followed by a steady rise over the subsequent seven days. The stark difference in 
values between the PHL7 strain and the wild-type control (p-value = 6.91e-07) supports the conclusion of PHL7-
mediated PET degradation. To confirm the presence of TPA in the reaction media, we submitted the sample for 
HESI-Orbitrap analysis (LC–MS), which verified TPA ’s presence (Fig.  5, Supplementary Figure 7) and bis(2-
hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) absence (Supplementary Figure 8).
Discussion
Plastic pollution is a significant challenge on a global scale, with no clear resolution in sight. While plastic 
recycling processes are in effect today, they are expensive, cumbersome, and generally only work for downcycling, 
thus limiting their use23. New systems designed around a much more efficient process are required, with lower 
environmental impact, lower costs, and much easier to scale. One such new system could be built around 
the biological recycling of polyester plastics, including PET, polyurethanes, and several other polyester-based 
plastics. Using enzymes to depolymerize polyester plastics, ideally into their monomeric constituents, would 
allow for actual recycling or even upcycling into new plastic products 24. This solution would require technical 
advances and political and social changes to support such an endeavor. Within this framework, polyester plastic 
recycling using enzymes is a promising strategy with a potential market demand of at least 140,000 T/year of 
recycled PET alone20. Polyester polyurethanes could also be added to this recycling program at similar levels of 
material25.
Plastic degrading enzyme production could also be synergic with the production of microalgae bioplastic 
precursors, potentially displacing petroleum as a raw material supply chain while contributing to CO2 capture18. 
Implementation of this technology would achieve the benefits of providing biodegradable plastics in the 
market while simultaneously supplying (enzymes) for enzymatically recycling them. Enzymes are pivotal for 
the bioconversion of plastics, and several enzymes have been studied for plastic degradation 26. Remarkable 
improvements in available PET degrading enzymes have been made through either bioprospection to identify 
novel enzymes from the environment19 or enzyme engineering to improve existing enzymes 20. These enzymes 
can now be produced in different recombinant systems (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5811103). Unfortunately, 
all current industrial-scale growth systems are heterotrophic, which demand fixed carbon feedstocks, partially 
displacing the benefit of any plastic recycling. A more sustainable alternative is to use phototrophic organisms 
to produce these enzymes, and microalgae are an ideal candidate due to their innate photosynthetic nature and 
proven capacity to produce precursors that can be converted to petroleum replacements for fuel and plastic1,17.
Here, we used green microalgae to secrete the polyester depolymerizing enzyme PHL7, and demonstrated 
its capacity to degrade post-consumer polyester plastics, including both PET and polyester polyurethanes. 
Our system used the previously developed pJP32 vector 27 to drive efficient secretion of this plastic-degrading 
enzyme from algae cells and a screening strategy based on halo formation around colonies to detect secreting 
colonies (Supplementary Figure 1). Impranil is a polyester polyurethane dispersion that decreases the agar plate 
transparency and becomes clear when it is enzymatically degraded. While wild-type strains might secrete native 
enzymes capable of cleaving ester bonds for a specific substrate, no degradation of Impranil was observed (e.g., 
colonies without surrounding halo in Supplementary Figure 1 and 6). This is expected since C. reinhardtii has 
never been observed to utilize nutrients trapped inside polymeric structures outside the cell for growth (e.g., 
plastics).
To further characterize the enzyme secreted by C. reinhardtii, we screened candidate colonies using the FDA 
and the Impranil degradation assays (Fig. 2). Both methods successfully identified positive strains, though they 
differ significantly in sensitivity, specificity, and practicality. The FDA assay offers a faster screening option, 
with results obtained in approximately 40 min. However, this method is not specific to polymer degradation, as 
native enzymes can also cleave FDA28. This demands the inclusion of proper controls to account for background 
enzymatic activity unrelated to plastic degradation. While the assay is cost-effective due to its cheap substrate, 
its utility is limited because a follow-up test is required to confirm the presence of a plastic-degrading enzyme. 
In contrast, the Impranil -based assay, though taking longer to produce results, is more specific to polymer 
degradation. Native enzymes are incapable of cleaving this substrate (see Fig.  1 and Supplementary Figure 1), 
making it a more reliable indicator of plastic degradation potential.
Moreover, Impranil is structurally closer to post-consumer plastics, further aligning the assay with real-world 
applications. Interestingly, both methods underestimated the actual number of positive strains. Subsequent 
blotting of strains led to more halo formations than those identified by the FDA or Impranil assays. This suggests 
that both enzymatic assays may have relatively higher detection limits than the agar plate strategy, potentially 
missing weaker positive strains. The increased sensitivity of the agar plate method is likely due to prolonged 
and continuous exposure of the Impranil® substrate to live, enzyme-secreting cells, allowing for localized 
accumulation and visible degradation over time. However, they remain useful for comparing candidates, as they 
provide a more straightforward and objective measurement of enzymatic activity compared to the subjective 
nature of halo formation. Though more subjective, the halo formation assay appears to have a lower detection 
limit. This is likely due to the continuous production of the enzyme by live cells near the cell patches, allowing for 
signal buildup over time. This accumulation likely increases the assay’s sensitivity, enabling it to detect weaker or 
slower enzyme activity that the FDA and Impranil assays may miss.
We observed the formation of two clearing zones in a zymogram containing Impranil as a substrate. The 
two clearing zones indicate the presence of two active isoforms of the enzyme. Protein sequencing of both

regions identified the presence of PHL7 peptides ( https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13981200). Analysis of the 
protein sequence with NetNGlyc 1.0 29 indicates the presence of three possible glycosylation sites at the 170, 
171, and 188 amino acid positions (Supplementary Figure 5), which possibly explains the two bands observed 
since consecutive glycosylation sites are likely not completely glycosylated (e.g. both positions glycosylated). 
The peptides in the putative glycosylation region were also not observed in the protein sequence, likely due to 
unmatched expected peptide mass due to carbohydrate addition. We designed a gene version with substitutions 
in all three glycosylation sites to further characterize the protein, replacing the asparagine (N) with aspartic acid 
(D). Aspartic acid residues do not serve as sites for N-linked glycosylation because they lack the necessary amide 
group that forms the glycosidic bond with the sugar moiety. With the new pJP32PHL7dg vector (Supplementary 
Figure 6) containing the modified version of PHL7 containing aspartic acid residues (PHL7dg), we obtained 
only a single clearing zone in the zymogram (Fig.  3), indicating the absence of glycosylation in PHL7dg, as 
predicted.
Interestingly, the number of colonies displaying halos in our transformation with the pJP32PHL7dg vector 
was significantly lower, suggesting that removing the glycosylation site in PHL7dg impacted the activity or 
processing of the protein in algae 30. This aligns with findings where adding glycomodules to mVenus resulted 
in a 12-fold increase in secretion 31, and a similar effect may have occurred here. However, the primary goal 
of the pJP32PHL7dg experiment was to assess the presence of glycosylation in PHL7 via gel shifting, and the 
observed transformation result is based on a single transformation event. Further exploration is required for a 
more meaningful conclusion to be drawn.
We conducted an enzymatic degradation assay using PET beads to validate further the activity of PHL7 
secreted by C. reinhardtii. In this assay, we incubated a concentrated supernatant from the PHL7 strain and 
a wild-type control in 500  mM phosphate buffer (pH 8) at 68  °C. The results showed a rapid increase in 
absorbance at 240 nm for the PHL7 sample, indicating potential PET degradation. In contrast, the wild-type 
sample showed a slight decrease in absorbance, likely due to components either precipitating out of the solution 
or degrading at the elevated temperature.The PET beads used in this assay had high crystallinity (~ 50%), while 
PET bottles have a range of 30–40%, and other PET plastic containers 6–8% 32,33. Crystallinity is a key factor 
in enzyme accessibility, as highly crystalline PET is usually more resistant to enzymatic breakdown 34. Despite 
this challenge, the PHL7 enzyme still demonstrated degradation activity, suggesting its efficacy even on more 
structurally robust PET substrates. Nevertheless, complete degradation was not observed, either by crystallinity 
resistance or enzyme losing activity after an extended time. PHL7 has been reported to exhibit activity over a 
broad temperature range, from at least 40–85 °C, against PET substrates, with peak activity observed between 
70 and 80 °C 19. This thermotolerance results from PHL7’s inherent stability at elevated temperatures and the 
temperature-induced conformational changes in PET that facilitate its degradation. In contrast, other substrates 
may not be as constrained by such temperature-dependent conformational changes, and optimal degradation 
temperatures for these substrates are expected to differ.
Interestingly, after day 2, both the wild-type and PHL7 samples displayed similar trends in the increase of 
absorbance (p-value: 0.5159). This suggests that another process, unrelated to the direct enzymatic activity of 
PHL7, may be contributing to the signal. However, given that terephthalic acid (TPA), one of the monomers 
released during PET degradation, was detected by GC–MS in both samples at the final time point, it is possible 
that some level of PET degradation occurred in both conditions. However, the PHL7 sample exhibited a stronger 
signal, consistent with the higher 240 nm absorbance, further supporting the role of PHL7 in PET degradation. 
Overall, the increase in absorbance and the detection of TPA reinforce the conclusion that PHL7 facilitates PET 
degradation. The additional increase in signal for the wild-type suggests that other environmental or chemical 
factors may influence PET breakdown, albeit to a lesser extent.
This experiment utilized a concentrate of the supernatant containing the PHL7 enzyme, a potential approach 
for plastic degradation. Specifically, algal biomass can be separated from the PHL7-containing supernatant and 
converted into alternative materials, such as animal feed, fuel, or plastic1. Y et, another strategy involves exposing 
plastic to growing cultures that secrete active enzymes. To illustrate this, we demonstrated a preliminary 
degradation experiment of a sustainable polyester urethane (sPU) film (Supplementary Figure 9). Since sPU can 
be derived from biological sources, our group has previously shown the successful conversion of algae oil and 
starch to form such materials1,35. After approximately ten days of exposure to the pJP32PHL7 culture, secreting 
the PHL7 enzyme, the culture breached the sPU film and fell into the receiving flask. The culture was maintained 
for an additional month, during which no breach occurred with the wild-type strain. This result only illustrates 
the strategy since no replicas were performed. Still, it is corroborated by the thousands of colonies observed in 
our Impranil selection plates, displaying clearing zones (halos) around them after growth (Supplementary Figure 
1, Supplementary Figure 4, Video 1).
Previously, C. reinhardtii was used to express IsPETase in the chloroplast, one of the first enzymes shown 
to degrade PET plastics. PET degradation was confirmed using HPLC and scanning electron microscopy with 
lysates from the transformed cells, demonstrating the potential of green algae to produce the enzyme36. However, 
the accumulation of enzymes inside the cells poses challenges, as it requires cell disruption to release the enzyme, 
a resource and energy-intensive process. This also complicates the separation of cell biomass from the enzyme, 
limiting the biomass from being used to produce fuel or bioplastics. Similarly, other researchers engineered 
IsPETase to be secreted by the marine diatom Phaeodactylum tricornutum, demonstrating PET degradation. 
Culturing with post-consumer plastic yielded lower enzyme activity, potentially due to suboptimal enzymatic 
reaction conditions (i.e., 37 °C)37 since performed at P . tricornutum growth condition (i.e., 21 °C)38.
In the case of C. reinhardtii producing PHL7, the optimal culture temperature (~ 25 °C39) differs significantly 
from the optimal temperature for PHL7 activity on PET (~ 70  °C19). Therefore, a compartmentalized 
process may be more economically and environmentally feasible, as matching growth conditions to enzyme 
requirements for efficient plastic degradation is unlikely. Nonetheless, we have demonstrated that C. reinhardtii,

www.nature.com/scientificreports/
while secreting PHL7, can degrade polymers such as Impranil DLN and sPU plastic film. Further analyses, such 
as techno-economic assessments (TEA) and life cycle assessments (LCA), are necessary to determine which 
compartmentalized or integrated strategy would be more effective. However, these analyses are beyond the scope 
of this manuscript.
Conclusion
Overall, our experiments demonstrate that green algae can efficiently secrete PHL7, an enzyme capable of 
degrading polyester plastics and that the enzyme can depolymerize PET plastic and polyurethane plastics. We 
demonstrated a comprehensive strategy to generate and efficiently screen recombinant strains capable of secreting 
functional plastic degrading enzymes, employing a polyplastic dispersion (e.g. Impranil plates). Such a strategy 
can be applied to further examine secretion of plastic-degrading enzymes, or even to help elucidate synthetic 
biology strategies to increase secretion in different systems. We envisioned two possible strategies to degrade 
plastic with green algae biologically. A coupled system, in which cultures would not only harbor the required 
nutrients for cell growth but also contain plastic material to be degraded and used as a food source for the algae. 
Ideally, the strain should be further engineered to assimilate the released organic molecules from the plastic 
in an upcycling process. Such a strategy is challenging since membrane transporters, metabolic engineering 
to incorporate the required pathway, and the need to match the cell requirement to growth and the enzyme 
requirements to degrade plastic are not presently aligned. On the other hand, a compartmentalized strategy 
appears attainable in the foreseeable future, provided that each process, cell growth and enzyme reaction, can be 
performed independently and in its optimal setup.
Material and methods
Assembly of transformation vectors
All restriction enzymes used in this study were acquired from New England Biolabs (Ipswich, MA, US). The 
vectors utilized are derivatives of the pJP32 vector 27, available in the Supplementary dataset. These vectors 
were assembled using the pBlueScript II KS + (pBSII) backbone. To create the pJP32 PHL7 construct, the 
required PHL7 codon-optimized sequence (Uniprot: A0AA82WPD4) was purchased from IDT (Integrated 
DNA Technologies, San Diego, CA, USA) and integrated into the expression vectors by NEBuilder HiFi DNA 
Assembly (NEB—New England Biolabs). The backbone was prepared by PCR using the protocol described in  (   h 
t t p s : / / d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 1 7 5 0 4 / p r o t o c o l s . i o . b p r i m m 4 e     ) , with 20 bp homology arms to the synthesized PHL7 sequence. 
The deglycosylated version (PHL7dg) was also added in the same fashion. All vectors contain restriction sites 
flanking the expression cassette for linearization, XbaI on the 5′ side and KpnI on the 3′ end. Final sequences can 
be found at  (   h t t p s : / / d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 5 2 8 1 / z e n o d o . 1 3 9 5 9 9 2 4     ) . All vector maps can be found at Supplementary Figure 
10. The pJP32_PHL7 is available through the Chlamydomonas Resource Center (https://www.chlamycollection.
org/).
Culture conditions and C. reinhardtii transformation
Nuclear transformations were performed on the wildtype, cell wall-containing strain C. reinhardtii cc1690 (mt+) 
(Chlamydomonas Resource Center in St. Paul, MN, USA). This strain was propagated in TAP medium at 25 °C, 
with constant illumination at 80 μmol photons/m2s, and agitated at 150 rpm on a rotary shaker. Growth curves 
were established using the protocol described in protocols.io (https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bpvbmn2n), 
involving the addition of 160 µL aliquots from 250 mL cultures into a 96-well plate per daily sampling. The 
absorbance was then measured using an Infinite M200 PRO plate reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland), 
ensuring each strain was represented by three biological replicates. For transformation, C. reinhardtii cells 
were grown to the mid-log phase, achieving a density of 3–6 × 106 cells/mL in TAP media, under the previously 
mentioned conditions ( https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.bx5cpq2w)21. Cells were then harvested by 
centrifugation at 3000×g for 10 min and resuspended in a MAX Efficiency Transformation Reagent for Algae 
to a 3–6 × 108 cells/mL density. Following a 5–10 min incubation on ice with 500 ng of a double-digested vector 
plasmid, the cells were electroporated using a Gene Pulser set to 2000 V/cm and 20 μs. Vector gets integrated 
into the nucleus by non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Post-electroporation, the cells were allowed to recover 
in TAP medium, under gentle agitation in room light, for 18  h. The recovered cells were then centrifuged, 
resuspended in 600 μL TAP medium, and spread onto two TAP/agar plates containing either 0.5% or 0.75% 
(v/v) Impranil DLN with 15 μg/mL of zeocin. Incubation continued under light at 60 μmol photons/m 2s and a 
temperature of 25 °C until colony formation was observed.
Strain screening
Transformants were screened for enzyme activity by observing areas of Impranil DLN clearing or “halos” 
around colonies on TAP agar plates containing 15 µg/mL Zeocin and Impranil DLN at 0.5% and 0.75% (v/v) (  
h t t p s :  / / d o i .  o r g / 1 0  . 1 7 5 0 4  / p r o t  o c o l s .  i o . r m 7  v z b 6 9 5  v x 1 / v 1). The total number of colonies was determined using 
OpenCFU40. These halos indicated the degradation of the Impranil DLN polymer in the plates. Cultured in 
160µL of TAP medium for five days in 96-well plates (Nunc Edge 96-Well, Nunclon Delta-Treated, Flat-Bottom 
Microplate, Thermo Scientific), we selected 84 colonies from these plates following the protocol detailed in  h t t p 
s : / / d o i . o r g / 1 0 . 1 7 5 0 4 / p r o t o c o l s . i o . b i g 9 k b z 6     , alongside six wild type colonies and six wells with media as blanks. 
We used a Thermo plate shaker, Model #4625 (Thermo Scientific, 2555 Kerper Boulevard, Iowa, USA, Thermo 
Labline 4625 Titer shaker) set to 800 rpm under constant illumination (60 µmol photons/m 2s) for cultivation. 
Absorbance and fluorescence measurements were taken using an Infinite M200 PRO plate reader (Tecan, 
Männedorf, Switzerland) with complete settings described in the Data Setting file. To establish a baseline for 
our experiments, the six independent replicates of the parental wild-type strain cc1690 were used as a negative

control. Following cultivation, we centrifuged the plates at 3000 xg for 5 min to collect the supernatant, which 
was then used in the enzymatic assay. The remaining cultures were transferred using a microplate replicator onto 
a rectangular agar plate containing TAP and Impranil DLN dispersion to confirm the selected colonies’ ability to 
generate halos. The PHL7-secreting strain of C. reinhardtii is accessible through the Chlamydomonas Resource 
Center, cataloged under the identifier CC-6203 (https://www.chlamycollection.org/).
Plate reader settings
The Infinite M200 PRO plate reader (Tecan, Männedorf, Switzerland) plate reader was set to measure cell density 
and PHL7 activity. Cell density could be followed with chlorophyll fluorescence at Ex. 440 nm Em. 680 nm, 
and absorbance at 750 nm. A set of protocols followed enzyme activity. Using Fluorescein Diacetate (FDA), 
a fluorophore that fluoresces at Ex. 490 nm Em. and 520 nm when the ester bonds are cleaved, the detailed 
protocol was added to protocol.io ( h t t p s :  / / d o i .  o r g / 1 0  . 1 7 5 0 4  / p r o t  o c o l s .  i o . n 2 b  v j 3 j 9 b  l k 5 / v 1). The activity was also 
followed using a plastic dispersion protocol with Impranil DLN (Bayer Corporation, Germany), using a gel 
containing 0.2% (m/v) agarose and 0.25% Impranil DLN DLN (v/v) to keep Impranil DLN in suspension and 
absorbances readings were made in 5 min intervals as detailed described in (  h t t p s :  / / d o i .  o r g / 1 0  . 1 7 5 0 4  / p r o t  o c o l

method using UV-transparent 96 well plates and readings at 240 nm. The protocol is fully described in ( h t t p s :  / / 
d o i .  o r g / 1 0  . 1 7 5 0 4  / p r o t  o c o l s .  i o . b p 2  l 6 x p 8 k  l q e / v 1). All settings are described in Data settings file.
Zymogram
We utilized the TGX Stain-Free FastCast Acrylamide Starter Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA) to prepare 
upright, SDS zymogram gels. The acrylamide solution was mixed as per the manufacturer’s instructions, with 
the modification of adding 1% v/v Impranil DLN to the solution to enable the detection of enzyme activity. 
This mixture was then poured into a casting frame and allowed to polymerize. Post-polymerization, the gel 
was placed in the electrophoresis apparatus and run under standard protein gel conditions (120–160 V , 1–2 h), 
with Tris/glycine/SDS running buffer following the run front with the blue dye. The samples were prepared for 
electrophoresis by adding 4X Laemmli buffer (#1610747, Bio-Rad Laboratories, USA). Following electrophoresis, 
the gel was incubated in phosphate buffer solution (pH 8.0) at 37 °C, facilitating the exchange of residual running 
buffer and establishing conditions optimal for PHL7 activity until transparent bands (clearing zones) appeared. 
This incubation step was crucial for developing clearing zones, which indicates enzymatic degradation of the 
Impranil DLN within the gel matrix. Clearing zones typically emerged within a couple of days of incubation, 
allowing for the qualitative assessment of enzyme activity.
Protein sequencing
The bands identified in the zymogram of the pJP32 PHL7 supernatant sample were sequenced to confirm the 
presence of the PHL7 protein. Shortly, the band was cut and reduced into 1 mm cubes, followed by washing steps 
to remove running buffers and dyes, first with H20, then a 50/50 ACN/H2O, and finally only ACN. The samples 
were then alkylated, digested with trypsin, and extracted in a 5% formic acid solution for mass spectrometry. 
The mass spectrometry was performed at the Biomolecular and Proteomics Mass Spectrometry Facility at UC 
San Diego using a LUMOS Orbi-Trap, and their full protocol can be found under “ h t t p s :  / / b p m s  f . u c s d  . e d u / t  r a i n 
i  n g - p r o  t o c o l s  / p r o t o  c o l s . h t m l”.
PET degradation assay
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) beads (Goodfellow Cambridge Limited, Huntingdon, UK; Product code 
ES306000/1) with a maximum particle size of 300  µm and crystallinity of > 50% were used for enzymatic 
degradation studies. The degradation of PET was assessed by quantifying the release of terephthalic acid (TPA) 
via absorbance at 240 nm using a UV-transparent microplate (UV-Star 96-well microplates). PET plastic beads 
were washed in 1  M potassium phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and prepared as a slurry with 20–30% solids. In 
individual PCR tubes, 50 µL of PET slurry, 50 µL of 100 mM potassium phosphate buffer, and 100 µL of plastic-
degrading enzyme solution were combined. The reaction was initiated by mixing, followed by centrifugation, 
and the absorbance at 240 nm was measured to establish a baseline (T0). Tubes were incubated at 68 °C for seven 
days in a thermocycler with a heated lid (105 °C) to prevent condensation. After incubation, the tubes were 
cooled to room temperature, and 100 µL of the supernatant was transferred to UV-Star 96-well microplates for 
absorbance measurement at 240 nm using a TECAN plate reader. A control with the supernatant of a wild-type 
strain was included to account for non-enzymatic degradation. The extent of PET degradation was calculated 
by comparing absorbance values from the test samples to those of the control. The absorbance values were 
converted to milligram equivalents of terephthalic acid (TPA) using a standard curve generated with TPA 
dissolved in buffer and measured under the same conditions as the samples.
Monomer detection—mass spectrometry
Enzyme samples were incubated with PET beads plastic in 0.5 M potassium phosphate buffer, pH8, at 68 °C for 
seven days. The supernatant was recovered and submitted to a liquid–liquid extraction protocol.
Liquid–liquid extraction of TPA and LC–MS
The monomers from PET were extracted from a 100 µL enzymatic reaction mixture using a standardized solvent 
extraction method. An equal volume of ethyl acetate (100 µL) was initially added to the enzymatic reaction 
mixture in a centrifuge tube, facilitating the monomer’s extraction. 50 uL of HCl ~ 10 M was added and the 
mixture was then vortexed vigorously for complete mixing and subsequently centrifuged at 10,000×g for 5 min 
to enable phase separation. The upper organic layer containing the extracted TPA was carefully transferred to a

new tube. To dry ethyl acetate extract was then subjected to solvent evaporation under normal pressure and room 
temperature overnight to avoid thermal degradation of TPA. The resultant dry TPA extract was resuspended in 
methanol for mass spectrometry. Monomer detection was performed via direct injection on a HESI-Orbitrap in 
negative mode. The source temperature was 100C, sheath gas flow was 10, capillary temperature was 350 C, and 
the spray voltage was 3.5 kV . FTMS scans were taken from 90 to 500 m/z at 240,000 resolution. The injection 
flow rate was set at 10uL/min. The EIC at 165.02 m/z, identified as the deprotonated TPA [M-H], was averaged 
over 30 s.
Plastic film degradation
A sustainable polyester urethane (sPU) film derived from algae oil was obtained from Algenesis Materials (PC2). 
10 mL of C. reinhardtii cc1690 cell cultures and pJP32PHL7 at density 3–6 × 107 cells/mL in TAP medium were 
added to 50 mL centrifuge tubes (Genesee Scientific 28-108). The centrifuge tubes were sealed with the sPU film, 
locked into place with black electrical tape, and inverted so that the culture was in direct contact with the sPU 
film. The inverted tube containing cell culture was fitted tightly into the opening of an Erlenmyer flask. A syringe 
equipped with a syringe filter (Whatman Uniflo 9916-1302) was inserted into the conical part of the inverted 
centrifuge tube, establishing an open system that ensures sterility. This configuration allowed for aeration within 
the system while safeguarding against culture contamination. The cells were cultured in this configuration at a 
stable temperature of 25 °C with constant illumination at 80 μmol photons/m 2s and agitated at 150 rpm on a 
rotary shaker for ten days or until the cell cultures had degraded and penetrated the sPU film.
Data analysis
R Statistic version 4.3.2 running in the RStudio 2023.09.1+494 “Desert Sunflower” was used to import and 
process data, generate the statistical summary, and generate the plots. The codes used are deposited at Zenodo 
(https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13959987). The data herein was collected from experiments in which, 
pJP32PHL7 was used to transform the CC1690 strain, and 84 colonies were picked for screening. These colonies 
were individually assessed through absorbance and fluorescence measurements, providing 84 independent data 
points per condition in the initial screening phase. For FDA analysis, the presence of cells after centrifugation 
interferes with the activity measurement due to enzymes inside cells41, and wells with a chlorophyll signal higher 
than 100 RFU were excluded from the analysis. In flask culture analyses, standard deviation bars represent the 
variation across three biological replicates of each strain.
