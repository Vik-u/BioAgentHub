Abstract: Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the most prevalent transparent thermoplastics.
It is commonly utilized due to its low cost and high durability. With the massive accumulation of
waste PET, however, serious environmental pollution has become a global problem. Compared to
traditional chemical degradation, biodegradation of PET catalyzed by PET hydrolase (PETase) is more
environmentally friendly and energy-efﬁcient. BbPETaseCD from the Burkholderiales bacterium is a
PETase that shows favorable properties for application in the biodegradation of PET. To enhance the
enzymatic performance of this enzyme, this work focuses on the rational design of disulﬁde bridges
in BbPETaseCD. We utilized two computational algorithms to predict the probable disulﬁde-bridge
mutations in BbPETaseCD, and ﬁve variants were acquired from the computations. Among these,
the N364C/D418C variant with one additional disulﬁde bond showed higher expression than the
wild-type enzyme (WT) and the best enzymatic performance. The melting temperature (Tm) of the
N364C/D418C variant presented an increase of 14.8 ◦C over that of WT (56.5 ◦C), indicating that the
additional disulﬁde bond signiﬁcantly raised the thermodynamic stability of the enzyme. Kinetic
experiments at different temperatures also demonstrated the thermal stability increase of the variant.
The variant also showed signiﬁcantly increased activity over WT when using bis(hydroxyethyl)
terephthalate (BHET) as the substrate. More remarkably, the N364C/D418C variant exhibited
approximately an 11-fold increase over the WT enzyme in the long-term (14 days) degradation of
PET ﬁlms. The results prove that the rationally designed disulﬁde bond signiﬁcantly improved the
enzymatic performance of the enzyme for PET degradation.

1. Introduction
Plastic products are widely used due to their light weight, easy manufacturing, and
high durability [1]. The annual production capacity of plastic products is about 350 million
tons [2]. However, only around 9% of plastic trash is recycled, while the remainder is burnt
or disposed of in landﬁlls [3]. Plastic waste will form microplastics (<5 mm) after crushing
and weathering. Under the inﬂuence of ocean circulation, microplastics have almost spread
all over the world [4,5], resulting in serious environmental pollution. As one of the most
common transparent thermoplastics, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is widely used in
beverage bottles, food packaging, and other ﬁelds [6,7]. However, it is estimated that in the
natural environment, PET will take 300 to 450 years to degrade [8].
Traditional chemical degradation of PET includes glycolysis [ 9], alcoholysis [ 10],
and so on. The chemical degradation process often requires high temperatures and pres-
sure and will be accompanied by the production of some pollutants [ 11]. In contrast,
the biodegradation of PET by enzymes is more energy-efficient and environmentally
friendly, and a variety of PET hydrolases have been identified, such as leaf–branch com-
post cutinase (LCC), Humicola insolens cutinase ( HiC), Thermobifida fusca cutinase ( Tf C),

and Saccharomonospora viridis AHK 190 cutinase (Cut190) [ 12–14]. It is noted that these
PET hydrolases have high optimum reaction temperature and energy requirements.
Yoshida et al. [ 15] discovered a bacterium that can hydrolyze PET. IsPETase produced
by the bacteria can hydrolyze PET into small molecules at moderate temperature. In
addition, several PETase-like enzymes were determined through phylogenetic tree
analysis, such as the RgPETase from Rhizobacter gummiphilus [16], the PbPETase from
Polyangium brachysporum , and the BbPETase from Burkholderiales bacterium [17]. Of
these, BbPETase differs from other type IIb enzymes in having an extra 143 amino acids
(AAs) at the N-terminus. The segment was renamed BbPETaseAND , and the core do-
main of this enzyme was called BbPETaseCD. Although BbPETaseAND provided higher
thermal stability for the enzyme, it may limit enzyme performance by interfering with
the enzyme’s interaction with the substrate PET [ 17]. The melting temperature ( Tm) of
BbPETase is about 6 ◦C higher than that of IsPETase, indicating its better thermal stabil-
ity. Nonetheless, its stability and activity are still insufficient to satisfy the demands of
practical applications.
A variety of enzyme engineering techniques have been used to improve the activity
and stability of PETase, and the rational design of disulfide bridges is a reasonable
scheme for improvement. Disulfide bonds primarily stabilize proteins by improving
the rigidity of the protein structure and decreasing the entropy of the protein’s unfolded
state [ 18]. Researchers improved the stability of some enzymes by computer-aided
design to introduce disulfide bridges. Gihaz et al. [ 19] obtained a variant of lipase from
Geobacillus stearothermophilus T6 by the computational design with DbD and MODIP
programs, which had higher Tm value and significantly higher activity than the wild-
type enzyme. Bashirova et al. [ 20] enhanced the structural rigidity of endoglucanase by
the rational design of disulfide-bridge mutations through the BioLuminate program,
and the half-life of the obtained variants were significantly increased.
In this study, we introduced disulfide bridges in BbPETaseCD by computer-aided de-
sign to improve the stability and activity of the enzyme. The structure of BbPETaseCD was
predicted and analyzed using DbD2 (http://cptweb.cpt.wayne.edu/DbD2/index.php,
accessed on 25 November 2022 ) [ 21] in conjunction with DSDBASE-MODIP(http://
caps.ncbs.res.in/iws/modip.html, accessed on 25 November 2022) [ 22,23]. SWISS-
MODEL homologous modeling (https://swissmodel.expasy.org/interactive, accessed
on 26 November 2022 ) [ 24] was used to screen out mutant combinations that could
correctly form disulfide bridges. We finally obtained P207C/D280C, A209C/R283C,
and N364C/D418C variants through prediction and screening, and then obtained
P207C/D280C/N364C/D418C and A209C/R283C/N364C/D418C variants through
combining the mutations. These enzymes were extensively characterized to find the
best variant.
2. Results and Discussion
2.1. Rational Design of Disulﬁde Bridges and Protein Expression
We predicted the structure of BbPETaseCD using DbD2 and the DSDBASE-MODIP
program, and obtained 25 pairs versus 84 pairs of mutation combinations, respectively.
After removing two pairs of natural disulﬁde bonds and taking the intersection, nineteen
pairs of mutant combinations were obtained. After screening according to the parameters
or criteria mentioned in Section 3.2, P207C/D280C, A209C/R283C, and N364C/D418C
variants were obtained for subsequent experiments. The distance between P207 and A209
and the distance between D280 and R283 are shown in Figure S1. In consideration of the
short distance between P207C/D280C and A209C/R283C, these two mutations were not
used together in further combination of the mutations to avoid possible steric hindrance.
By combining the P207C/D280C variant or A209C/R283C variant with the N364C/D418C
variant, the P207C/D280C/N364C/D418C and A209C/R283C/N364C/D418C variants
were obtained. The location of the disulﬁde bridge in the enzyme is depicted in Figure S2,
Molecules 2023, 28, 3528 3 of 12
where the natural disulﬁde bridge is marked in orange and the introduced disulﬁde bridge
in purple. The active site of BbPETaseCD is marked in red.
The expression of wild-type enzyme and variants was then determined. Only the
N364C/D418C variant showed an expression level comparable to the wild type (Table S2),
while the expression levels of the remaining variants were quite low. In the puriﬁcation
using afﬁnity chromatography (Figure S3), only theBbPETaseCD and N364C/D418C variant
showed obvious elution peak. We speculate that the mutation site of the P207C/D280C
and A209C/R283C variants were close to the N-terminal of the enzyme after removing the
extra N-terminal domain of the enzyme [17]. It made the protein more prone to misfolding
and led to low soluble expression, signiﬁcantly reducing the apparent expression level of
these variants.
The formation of disulﬁde bridge in enzyme was then examined using the protocol
described in Section 3.5. The results are shown in Table 1. It can be seen that not all
enzymes correctly formed disulﬁde bridges. The four variants with low expression had
low proportion of disulﬁde bridges. This also supported our suspicion that introducing
disulﬁde bridges near the protein’s N-terminal would reduce protein expression. Fur-
thermore, not all disulﬁde bridges of the BbPETaseCD formed upon expression, which
could be attributed to the E. coli Rosetta gami-B (DE3) strain. Expression of proteins with
disulﬁde bridges by the E. coli Rosetta gami-B (DE3) strain may be not very effective [25].
Therefore, it may adversely affect the correct formation of disulﬁde bridges in BbPETaseCD
and its variants. The sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) results of
BbPETaseCD and its variants are shown in Figure S4a. Minor bands near the target band
were observed, which was considered as the enzyme without correct formation of disulﬁde
bridges. Moreover, Figure S4b,c demonstrates that the bacterial lysates and precipitates of
all the four variants except the N364C/D418C variant contain darker bands around 30 kDa,
while their supernatants obtained after centrifugation have only very light bands around
30 kDa. This indicates that all the four variants produced many inclusion bodies during the
expression. This result conﬁrmed our conjecture that the four variants were less expressed
in soluble form.

2.2. Activity and Stability of BbPETaseCD and Its Variants
The activity of BbPETaseCD and its variants was evaluated using bis(Hydroxyethyl)
Terephthalate (BHET) as substrate. The N364C/D418C variant had the highest activity
in most cases, and no signiﬁcant difference was observed between the other variants
(Figure 1). At pH 9.0, the activity increased with increasing temperature. Meanwhile,
at each temperature tested (30, 40, 50 ◦C), the activity at pH 9.0 was higher than that at
pH 7.0, indicating that pH 9.0 is more suitable for the reaction. At pH 7.0, the activity
of BbPETaseCD increased from 30 ◦C to 40 ◦C, and then decreased when the temperature
increased to 50 ◦C, indicating the poor stability of BbPETaseCD at high temperature.
To evaluate the thermal stability, these enzymes were then incubated at 50◦C for 1, 2,
4, and 6 h following by the examination of residual activity. Meanwhile, these enzymes
were incubated for 1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 12, and 24 h at 40 ◦C (the temperature used for the long
reaction time in PET degradation experiments). The residual activity of these enzymes
decreased as the temperature of the incubation increased, but the magnitude of the decrease
Molecules 2023, 28, 3528 4 of 12
varied. At both 40 ◦C and 50 ◦C, the residual activity of the N364C/D418C variant was
higher than that of the BbPETaseCD (Figure 2a,b). The optimal reaction pH for BbPETaseCD
and its variants is mostly alkaline. Therefore, these enzymes are more able to maintain
their activity at pH 9.0. The Tm values of these enzymes were obtained by CD (Figure S5),
which showed that the Tm value of the N364C/D418C variant was 71.3 ◦C (Figure 2c),
signiﬁcantly higher than that of the BbPETaseCD (56.5 ◦C) and other variants. Compared
to the Tm value of BbPETaseCD, the P207C/D280C variant exhibited a lower Tm value,
while the other variants had a slightly higher Tm value. However, when the incubation
temperature was 40 ◦C, the residual activity of the N364C/D418C variant did not show
signiﬁcantly higher value than that of the other variants. It indicated that the addition of
disulﬁde bridges in the N364C/D418C variant signiﬁcantly improved the thermodynamic
stability of the enzyme, but had no obvious effect on its kinetic stability.

decreased as the temperature of the incubation increased, but the magnitude of the de-
crease varied. At both 40 °C and 50 °C, the residual activity of the N364C/D418C variant 
was  higher  than  that  of  the  BbPETaseCD  (Figure  2a,b).  The  optimal  reaction  pH  for

(Figure S5), which showed that the Tm value of the N364C/D418C variant was 71.3 °C (Fig-
ure 2c), signiﬁcantly higher than that of the BbPETaseCD (56.5 °C) and other variants. Com-
pared to the Tm value of BbPETaseCD, the P207C/D280C variant exhibited a lower Tm value,

temperature was 40 °C, the residual activity of the N364C/D418C variant did not show 
signiﬁcantly higher value than that of the other variants. It indicated that the addition of 
disulﬁde bridges in the N364C/D418C variant signiﬁcantly improved the thermodynamic 
stability of the enzyme, but had no obvious eﬀect on its kinetic stability.

2.3. Activity of BbPETaseCD and Its Variants for PET Film Degradation
The activity of BbPETaseCD and its variants for PET degradation were tested using
the protocol described in Section 3.9. The differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curve
of the substrate, Nongfu Spring PET mineral water bottle is shown in Figure S6. For this
reaction, 30 ◦C and 40 ◦C was tested; 50 ◦C was not used because the activity of these
enzymes decreased signiﬁcantly when the hydrolysis reaction of PET was performed at
this temperature. At 30 ◦C, the reaction time for test was 6 days. At 40 ◦C, the reaction
time was extended to 14 days. The degradation activity of BbPETaseCD and its variants on
PET at 40 ◦C was higher than that at 30 ◦C. Therefore, the reaction time was extended to
14 days at 40 ◦C. It can be seen that the hydrolytic activity of N364C/D418C variant on
PET ﬁlm was signiﬁcantly higher than that of BbPETaseCD (Figure 3a,b). The total amount
of soluble products released was up to 11-fold than that obtained using BbPETaseCD.
Furthermore, the PET hydrolysis activity of BbPETaseCD at 30 ◦C was always higher
than that at 40 ◦C, which further indicated its low thermal stability. N364C/D418C and
P207C/D280C/N364C/D418C variants, on the other hand, displayed signiﬁcantly higher
Molecules 2023, 28, 3528 5 of 12
reactivity at 40◦C than BbPETaseCD and other variants. For the remaining three variants, the
activity level was comparable to or much lower than that ofBbPETaseCD. We speculated that
the addition of disulﬁde bridges to the P207C/D280C and A209C/R283C variants caused
most of the enzyme to be degraded during expression due to misfolding and that a minor
portion of the undegraded enzyme was also negatively affected. This is reﬂected in their
signiﬁcantly lower PET hydrolysis activity than that of BbPETaseCD (Figure 3). Moreover,
the activity of P207C/D280C/N364C/D418C and A209C/R283C/N364C/D418C variants
were signiﬁcantly lower than that of N364C/D418C variant. This further indicated that the
mutation sites of P270C/D280C and A209C/R283C were unfavorable to the BbPETaseCD.

protocol described in Section 3.9. The diﬀerential scanning calorimetry (DSC) curve of the 
substrate, Nongfu Spring PET mineral water bottle is shown in Figure S6. For this reaction, 
30 °C and 40 °C was tested; 50 °C was not used because the activity of these enzymes 
decreased signiﬁcantly when the hydrolysis reaction of PET was performed at this tem-
perature. At 30 °C, the reaction time for test was 6 days. At 40 °C, the reaction time was 
extended to 14 days. The degradation activity of BbPETaseCD and its variants on PET at 40 
°C was higher than that at 30 °C. Therefore, the reaction time was extended to 14 days at 
40 °C. It can be seen that the hydrolytic activity of N364C/D418C variant on PET ﬁlm was 
signiﬁcantly higher than that of BbPETaseCD (Figure 3a,b). The total amount of soluble 
products released was up to 11-fold than that obtained using BbPETaseCD. Furthermore, 
the PET hydrolysis activity of BbPETaseCD at 30 °C was always higher than that at 40 °C, 
which  further  indicated  its  low  thermal  stability.  N364C/D418C  and 
P207C/D280C/N364C/D418C variants, on the other hand, displayed signiﬁcantly higher 
reactivity at 40 °C than BbPETaseCD and other variants. For the remaining three variants, 
the activity level was comparable to or much lower than that of BbPETaseCD. We specu-
lated that the addition of disulﬁde bridges to the P207C/D280C and A209C/R283C variants 
caused most of the enzyme to be degraded during expression due to misfolding and that 
a minor portion of the undegraded enzyme was also negatively aﬀected. This is reﬂected 
in their signiﬁcantly lower PET hydrolysis activity than that of BbPETaseCD (Figure 3).

40 ◦C (a), and 50 ◦C (b). The reaction temperature after incubation was 50◦C. The reaction buffer was
basic reaction buffer at pH 9.0. The ﬁnal concentration of enzyme was 50 nM. The ﬁnal concentration
of BHET was 200 mg/L. The Tm value of BbPETaseCD and its variants (c).
Following that, these PET ﬁlms’ incubation time was extended to 14 days at 40 ◦C,
and the comparative activity is shown in Figure 4. The activities of N364C/D418C and
P207C/D280C/N364C/D418C variants were signiﬁcantly higher than those of BbPETaseCD
and other variants. The activities of BbPETaseCD and other variants did not differ signif-
icantly. Li et al. [26] showed that the introduction of disulﬁde bonds in the same region
could reduce the local unfolding rate of the enzyme, which in turn would enhance the
structural rigidity of the region. The N364C/D418C mutation in this study was closer to the
two natural disulﬁde bonds and the active site of the enzyme than the other two mutations.
It is considered that the introduction of the N364C/D418C mutation increased the rigidity
of the loop region. In addition, the disulﬁde bond might change the whole structure of the
enzyme to some extent (though the change was not appreciable in Figure S2), resulting in
an enlarged substrate binding pocket for the enzyme, which facilitated the binding of the
Molecules 2023, 28, 3528 6 of 12
enzyme to BHET or PET. Furthermore, all the enzymes were almost completely inactivated
at 11 days because the soluble products almost stopped increasing after that. These PET
ﬁlms were washed at 14 days, and their surfaces were examined by scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) for traces of enzymatic erosion, as shown in Figure S7. The surface
of the PET ﬁlm after incubation with the N364C/D418C variant was very rough, with
obvious degradation marks. The surface of the PET ﬁlm showed obvious erosion marks
after incubation with the P207C/D280C/N364C/D418C variant, but the roughness was
lower than that of the N364C/D418C variant. These PET ﬁlms’ surfaces, on the other hand,
showed only very shallow ﬁsh-scale erosion marks after incubation with the BbPETaseCD
and other variants, which is consistent with the results of PET ﬁlm degradation activity.

cantly. Li et al. [26] showed that the introduction of disulﬁde bonds in the same region 
could reduce the local unfolding rate of the enzyme, which in turn would enhance the

rigidity of the loop region. In addition, the disulﬁde bond might change the whole struc-
ture of the enzyme to some extent (though the change was not appreciable in Figure S2),

ning electron microscopy (SEM) for traces of enzymatic erosion, as shown in Figure S7. 
The surface of the PET ﬁlm after incubation with the N364C/D418C variant was very 
rough, with obvious degradation marks. The surface of the PET ﬁlm showed obvious ero-
sion marks after incubation with the P207C/D280C/N364C/D418C variant, but the rough-
ness was lower than that of the N364C/D418C variant. These PET ﬁlms’ surfaces, on the 
other hand, showed only very shallow ﬁsh-scale erosion marks after incubation with the 
BbPETaseCD and other variants, which is consistent with the results of PET ﬁlm degrada-
tion activity.

2.4. Circular Dichroism (CD) and Fluorescence Analysis 
To investigate the structural changes in BbPETaseCD and its variants, these enzymes 
were characterized using CD and ﬂuorescence. The CD spectra of BbPETaseCD and its var-
iants are shown in Figure S8a. The overall trends of the curves were similar, except for the 
ellipticity peak. Signiﬁcant diﬀerences were observed in their secondary structures (Fig-
ure S8b), particularly in the content of α-helix and β-sheet. The A209C/R283C variant and 
the N364C/D418C variant showed high α-helix content and low β-sheet content. However, 
the  sum  of α -helix  and β -sheet  was  similar  to  that  of  BbPETaseCD.  For  the 
P207C/D280C/N364C/D418C and A209C/R283C/N364C/D418C variants, increased ran-
dom coil content was observed. 
The wavelengths corresponding to the ﬂuorescence peaks of the BbPETaseCD and the 
variants were nearly identical (Figure S9a). No obvious diﬀerence was observed between 
the BbPETaseCD and the N364C/D418C variant in the ﬂuorescence spectra, the endogenous 
tryptophan ﬂuorescence spectra, or the endogenous tyrosine ﬂuorescence spectra (Figure 
S9). The other four variants showed a slight red shift in the endogenous tryptophan ﬂuo-
rescence spectra compared to BbPETaseCD (Figure S9b). This indicated that the two pairs 
of disulﬁde bridges, P207C/D280C and A209C/R283C, had a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the struc-
ture of the enzyme. In the endogenous tyrosine ﬂuorescence spectra (Figure S9c), com-
pared to the BbPETaseCD, P207C/D280C variant showed a small red shift, and the left three 
variants showed blue shifts. Only the P207C/D280C variant had a lower Tm value, most 
likely due to the negative eﬀect of the P207C-D280C disulﬁde bridge on the structure and 
stability of BbPETaseCD.

2.4. Circular Dichroism (CD) and Fluorescence Analysis
To investigate the structural changes in BbPETaseCD and its variants, these enzymes
were characterized using CD and ﬂuorescence. The CD spectra of BbPETaseCD and its
variants are shown in Figure S8a. The overall trends of the curves were similar, except
for the ellipticity peak. Signiﬁcant differences were observed in their secondary struc-
tures (Figure S8b), particularly in the content of α-helix and β-sheet. The A209C/R283C
variant and the N364C/D418C variant showed high α-helix content and low β-sheet con-
tent. However, the sum of α-helix and β-sheet was similar to that of BbPETaseCD. For
the P207C/D280C/N364C/D418C and A209C/R283C/N364C/D418C variants, increased
random coil content was observed.
The wavelengths corresponding to the ﬂuorescence peaks of the BbPETaseCD and
the variants were nearly identical (Figure S9a). No obvious difference was observed
between the BbPETaseCD and the N364C/D418C variant in the ﬂuorescence spectra, the
endogenous tryptophan ﬂuorescence spectra, or the endogenous tyrosine ﬂuorescence
spectra (Figure S9). The other four variants showed a slight red shift in the endogenous
tryptophan ﬂuorescence spectra compared to BbPETaseCD (Figure S9b). This indicated that
the two pairs of disulﬁde bridges, P207C/D280C and A209C/R283C, had a signiﬁcant
effect on the structure of the enzyme. In the endogenous tyrosine ﬂuorescence spectra
(Figure S9c), compared to the BbPETaseCD, P207C/D280C variant showed a small red shift,
and the left three variants showed blue shifts. Only the P207C/D280C variant had a lower
Tm value, most likely due to the negative effect of the P207C-D280C disulﬁde bridge on the
structure and stability of BbPETaseCD.
3. Materials and Methods
3.1. Bacterial Strains, Plasmid, and Materials
E. coli JM109 served as the host strain for site-speciﬁc mutagenesis. E. coli Rosetta gami-
B (DE3) (Weidi Biotech, Shanghai, China) was used to express various mutant enzymes. The
gene for BbPETaseCD was synthesized by Genewiz (Suzhou, China) and using pET-22b(+)
plasmid as gene vector. DNA sequencing was performed by Genewiz (Suzhou, China).
5 mL His TrapTM FF afﬁnity chromatography column was purchased from GE Healthcare
(9 × 15.7 mm, 90 µm, Marlborough, MA, USA). Fast pfu enzyme and DpnI enzyme
were purchased from TransGen Biotech (Beijing, China). A plasmid extraction kit was
purchased from Beyotime (Shanghai, China). A BCA kit was purchased from Dingguo
Biotech (Tianjin, China). A sulfhydryl assay kit was purchased from Bestbio (Shanghai,
China). The crystallinity of PET ﬁlms was measured using DSC by Standard (Qingdao,
China). Other reagents were purchased from Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China), Heowns
(Tianjin, China), or Meryer (Shanghai, China).
3.2. Rational Design of Disulﬁde Bridges
The wild-type BbPETaseCD has two natural disulfide bridges, C333-C370 and
C404-C424 [ 17]. To improve the thermal stability of the enzyme, we used DbD2 and the
DSDBASE-MODIP program to predict mutation sites in the structure of BbPETaseCD
that could form disulfide bridges and then screened them using the conditions listed
below. Because disulfide bridges that were too close together could have an adverse
effect on the enzyme structure, mutation sites that were too close together (fewer than
10AAs in the primary structure) were removed at first [ 27]. Secondly, the preferential
selection of mutation sites located in the flexible loop region may improve the thermal
stability of the enzyme by increasing its local rigidity [ 18]. Meanwhile, predicted
mutation sites should avoid the enzyme’s active site or sites related to substrate binding
to avoid affecting enzyme activity. Finally, the variants were homology-modeled by
the SWISS-MODEL program [ 24] and visualized by PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org,
accessed on 26 November 2022) to see if they could correctly form disulfide bridges.
Molecules 2023, 28, 3528 8 of 12
3.3. Site-Directed Mutagenesis
All disulﬁde-bridge mutations were introduced by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).
After the PCR, the methylated template was removed with DpnI restriction endonuclease
for 20 min at 37 ◦C. The concentrated PCR products were transformed into competent
E. coli JM109 cells, and mutant plasmids were screened at 37 ◦C on Luria–Bertani (LB) agar
plate medium containing 100 µg/mL sodium ampicillin. DNA sequencing was also used to
identify the mutant plasmids. The correctly sequenced plasmid DNA was transformed into
E. coli Rosetta gami-B (DE3) for protein expression. Table S1 shows the primers used for
PCR, with underlines indicating the codons and anticodons corresponding to the mutation.
3.4. Expression and Puriﬁcation
E. coli Rosetta gami-B (DE3) strains containing various mutant plasmids were incu-
bated aerobically at 220 rpm and 37 ◦C in LB medium containing 100 µg/mL ampicillin
sodium until the optical density at 600 nm (OD 600) reached approximately 0.8–1.0 [ 17].
Isopropyl β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) was added to a ﬁnal concentration of 0.5 mM to
induce protein expression. After 24 h of protein expression at 16 ◦C, the bacteria were
harvested by centrifugation at 4000 rpm for 30 min at 4 ◦C. The bacteria were resuspended
in 25 mL of lysis buffer (30 mM imidazole, 50 mM Na 2HPO4, and 100 mM NaCl buffer,
pH 7.0) and lysed for 30 min using ultrasonication. After centrifugation at 10,000 rpm for
30 min at 4 ◦C, the supernatant was obtained and then ﬁltered through a 0.45 µm ﬁlter
membrane. The enzyme was puriﬁed in an AKTA-Basic chromatography system (GE
Healthcare, Marlborough, MA, USA) using a 5 mL His TrapTM FF afﬁnity chromatography
column. The column was ﬁrst equilibrated with lysis buffer at a ﬂow rate of 5 mL/min,
washed with lysis buffer at a ﬂow rate of 5 mL/min for 5 min after supernatant loading
was completed, then eluted with elution buffer (500 mM imidazole, 50 mM Na2HPO4, and
100 mM NaCl buffer, pH 7.0) at a ﬂow rate of 1 mL/min for 15 min. To remove imidazole,
the puriﬁed protein solution was centrifuged at 6000 rpm for 30 min through a 10 kDa
ultraﬁltration tube. Finally, the enzyme concentration was determined using the BCA kit
according to the instructions and diluted to the reaction concentration (5 µM). Sodium
dodecyl SDS-PAGE 12% was used to determine the purity and the molecular weight.
3.5. Analysis of Disulﬁde Bridge of Enzyme
To determine the sulfhydryl content of sample, the sample was mixed with the working
solution in the sulfhydryl assay kit according to the instructions, and the reaction was
carried out at room temperature for 15 min, followed by testing of OD412. All measurements
were conducted in triplicate (n = 3). The standard curve was obtained by ﬁtting the OD412
to the concentration of L-cysteine using standard solution of different concentrations, which
was then used for the calculation of sulfhydryl content. Thereafter, the enzyme (5 µM)
was prepared using the working solution, followed by the determination of sulfhydryl
content under nonreducing condition. Meanwhile, 50 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl) phosphine
(TCEP-HCl) was added to another group of enzyme (5 µM) to convert the disulﬁde bridges
in the enzymes to sulfhydryl, followed by the determination of sulfhydryl content under
reducing condition. Thereafter, the proportion of disulﬁde bridges formed in the enzyme
was determined by comparing the sulfhydryl content of the enzyme under nonreducing
and reducing conditions.
3.6. Fluorescence and CD Spectrums
The ﬂuorescence analysis was performed at room temperature on a ﬂuorescence spec-
trometer (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) using a quartz cuvette with a path length
of 1.0 cm. It was excited at 280 nm, and the emission spectra were detected in the range
of 250–450 nm with a slit width of 5.0 nm for both excitations and emissions. The ex-
citation wavelengths were set to 250–330 nm and the scanning intervals ( ∆λ) were set
to 15 and 60 nm to obtain their synchronous ﬂuorescence spectra, where ∆λ at 15 and
Molecules 2023, 28, 3528 9 of 12
60 nm represent the ﬂuorescence spectra of endogenous tyrosine (Tyr, Y) and tryptophan
(Trp, W), respectively.
The CD spectrum was tested by a Jasco J-810 circular dichroism spectrometer (Jasco,
Tokyo, Japan) using a quartz cuvette with a path length of 1.0 mm. Continuous scanning
was measured at 30 ◦C in the wavelength range of 190–260 nm with a data pitch of 0.1 nm,
a response time of 1.0 s, a bandwidth of 2.0 nm, and a scanning speed of 100 nm/min.
The secondary structure of the enzyme was analyzed by Dichroweb (http://dichroweb.
cryst.bbk.ac.uk/, accessed on 16 February 2023) on-line analysis [ 28,29]. To obtain the
Tm value of BbPETaseCD and its variants, the thermal denaturation curves of enzymes by
CD detection were used. Speciﬁcally CD signal at 222 nm was examined as a function of
temperature. The data was then ﬁtted with a Boltzmann curve, and the Tm value was the
temperature corresponding to the ﬁtted curve’s midpoint.
3.7. Enzyme Activity Using BHET as Substrate
The enzyme activity was examined at 30 ◦C, 40 ◦C, and 50 ◦C with the small molecule
BHET as the substrate. For the reaction, 910 µL of neutral reaction buffer (80 mM Na2HPO4,
40 mM NaCl, pH 7.0) or 910 µL of basic reaction buffer (50 mM Gly-NaOH, pH 9.0) was
used. Then, 10 µL of enzyme solution (5 µM) and 80 µL of BHET solution (2.5 g/L) were
added, so the ﬁnal concentration of enzyme was 50 nM while the ﬁnal concentration of
BHET was 200 µg/mL. The reaction was carried out for 30 min. At the end of the reaction,
an equal volume of reaction stop buffer (160 mM NaH2PO4, 20% v/v DMSO, pH 2.5) was
rapidly added, followed by a 10 min water bath at 85 ◦C. After 10 min of centrifugation at
12,000 rpm, the samples were passed through a 0.22 µm ﬁlter membrane and the products
were analyzed using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). All measurements
were conducted in triplicate (n = 3).
3.8. Thermal Stability of the Enzyme
To test the activity retention of enzyme after incubation at high temperature, we
mixed the enzymes with basic reaction buffer, followed by incubation. Herein, 50 ◦C
and 40 ◦C (temperature corresponding to long-term degradations of PET films) were
used. For 50 ◦C, incubation time of 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, and 6 h was used. For 40 ◦C, incubation
times of 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 9 h, 12 h, and 24 h were used. After incubation, the enzyme was
placed in ice water for 10 min and 80 µL of BHET solution was then added. The reaction
was carried out at 50 ◦C in a water bath for 30 min. The protocol of terminating and
analyzing the reaction was the same as that described in Section 3.7. All measurements
were conducted in triplicate ( n = 3).
3.9. Enzyme Activity for PET Film Degradation
A mineral water bottle (crystallinity of 32.3%, NongFu Spring, Tianjin, China) was
used as substrate. It was washed with 1% w/v SDS solution, ethanol, and deionized water,
and was cut into ﬁlms with a diameter of 6 mm. Each 2 mL centrifuge tube received
two PET ﬁlms, 300 µL basic reaction buffer (pH 9.0), and 12.5 µL enzyme for 6 days.
Reaction temperature of 30 ◦C and 40 ◦C was used. Meanwhile, 8 sets of reactions were
supplemented at 40 ◦C for 14 days. The protocol of terminating and analyzing the reaction
was the same as that described in Section 3.7. Following the reaction, the PET was washed
using the method described above. Traces of enzyme erosion on the PET surface were
observed by ﬁeld-emission scanning electron microscopy Apreo S LoVac (FEI, Hillsboro,
OR, USA). All measurements were conducted in triplicate (n = 3).
3.10. HPLC Analysis
HPLC analysis of aromatic products was performed on an Agilent 1100 series LC
system equipped with a Welch Ultimate XB-C18 column (4.6 × 250 mm, 5 µm, Welch
Materials, Shanghai, China) at a controlled column temperature of 25 ◦C. The mobile phase
contained 70% (v/v) distilled water, 20% (v/v) acetonitrile, and 10% (v/v) formic acid at a
Molecules 2023, 28, 3528 10 of 12
ﬂow rate of 1.0 mL/min. The aromatic products were detected by absorbance at 254 nm
and identiﬁed by the retention time of the standard compounds [30]. A calibration curve
consisting of the absorption peak area and the concentration of the standard solution was
used to calculate the concentration of each product. The calibration curve had an R-squared
value of at least 0.999.
4. Conclusions
Rational introduction of disulﬁde bridges in BbPETaseCD was performed through
computer-aided rational design. P207C/D280C, A209C/R283C, N364C/D418C, P207C/
D280C/N364C/D418C, and A209C/R283C/N364C/D418C variants were obtained. Among
them, the N364C/D418Cvariant showed the most signiﬁcant enhancement of the hydrolytic
activity of PET ﬁlms to about 11-fold that of BbPETaseCD and obtained an increase in the
Tm value of 14.8 ◦C. The additional disulﬁde bridge could signiﬁcantly improve the struc-
tural rigidity of BbPETaseCD, which in turn increased its stability and activity. The residual
activity of the N364C/D418C variant in this study was not signiﬁcantly higher than that of
the other variants after thermal incubation, whereas its Tm value was signiﬁcantly higher
than that of the other variants, indicating that the kinetic and thermodynamic stability
of this variant did not exactly match. Usually, high kinetic stability confers resistance to
enzyme inactivation at high temperatures, while high thermodynamic stability is man-
ifested by the higher free energy of enzyme unfolding, but the two are determined by
different molecular processes and therefore do not always correspond exactly [ 31]. The
remaining three variants showed no signiﬁcant improvement in activity and stability, ex-
cept for the P207C/D280C/N364C/D418C variant, which showed increased activity. The
N364C/D418C mutation was closer to the natural disulﬁde bond and the active site of the
enzyme than the other two mutations. This resulted in a signiﬁcant increase in the Tm value
of the enzyme by enhancing the regional structural rigidity of the enzyme [ 26], and we
hypothesize that the introduction of the N364C/D418C mutation changed the structure
of the enzyme, expanding its active site pocket and increasing its activity. In addition, the
expression levels of the P207C/D280C, A209C/R283C, P207C/D280C/N364C/D418C and
A209C/R283C/N364C/D418C variants were extremely low. We speculated that these four
variants contained mutating points close to the N-terminal of the enzyme, which made the
enzyme prone to misfolding and low expression during protein expression. It has been
reported that inefﬁcient disulﬁde bonds can have a negative impact on enzyme activity
and/or stability [32]. This may provide some reference for schemes to improve enzyme
stability through rational design of disulﬁde bridges, and mutations near the N-terminal of
proteins should be avoided for BbPETaseCD.
