In this review, we critically assess microbial consortia–mediated biodegradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) used in
orthodontic aligners as a means to address the environmental problems arising from biomedical plastic waste. PET’s chemical
stability and high crystallinity provide suﬃcient durability for clinical eﬃcacy; however, natural degradation is hindered in the
resulting environmental accumulation. Currently, the conventional disposal methods can lead to toxic emissions, so they have
to be kept in the dark in terms of innovations that reduce or eliminate them. These microbial consortia utilize hairy dynamics
of synergistic enzymatic activities, that is, PETase and MHETase, to degrade PET into assimilable monomers, with the
potential to be a bioremediation strategy. In this paper, we summarize current analytical methodologies to assess degradation,
present molecular tools to elucidate microbial community dynamics, and discuss biotechnological strategies to enhance
enzymatic eﬃciency and process scale-up potential. Slow degradation rates, material complexity, and environmental variability
are identiﬁed as challenges. Advances in enzyme engineering, bioaugmentation, and bioreactor design associated with
biodegradation performance are reviewed, and future research directions that will enhance the ecosystemic performance of
microbial consortia for eco-friendly and eﬀective management of PET waste from orthodontic aligners within the framework
of a circular bioeconomy are pointed out.

1. Introduction
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one of the most widely
used synthetic thermoplastic polymers in industries owing
to its prominent physical and chemical properties. PET has
been established as a preferred material for the fabrication
of orthodontic aligners; orthodontically speaking, these are
transparent dental devices that have the duty of gradually
correcting malocclusion [1], due to their durability, optical
clarity, chemical inertness, and biocompatibility. The key
modiﬁcation that changed orthodontic practice is the intro-
duction of clear aligners, as the aesthetics, comfort, and
removability of this metallic brace alternative have signiﬁ-
cantly increased patient compliance and quality of life while
wearing them [2]. Although the clinical advantages of PET-
based aligners have been proven, the increase in environ-
mental concerns for the usage of PET-based aligners has
made it diﬃcult to take this orthodontic appliance to mar-
ket. However, due to the short useful lifespan of orthodontic
aligners (made to be replaced a few weeks apart) and their
large-scale disposal, these biomedical plastics contribute to
the global burden of plastic waste, produced annually [3].

PET’s chemical structure, consisting of a highly stable aro-
matic polyester backbone, is resistant to natural degradation
processes such as hydrolysis and photodegradation and,
consequently, is persistent in terrestrial and aquatic environ-
ments for a prolonged period [4]. PET waste is

accumulating, contributing to microplastic pollution that
comes with bioaccumulation and trophic transfer [5].
Currently, the disposal of PET biomedical waste is by
incineration and landﬁll deposition. Nevertheless, incinera-
tion can be a source of emission of harmful substances, prin-
cipally dioxins and furans, that threaten air quality and
public health [6]. Conversely, landﬁlling is long-term con-
tamination of soil and groundwater resources via leaching
of additives and degradation products to the site [7]. Given
this, there is an immediate necessity for creating sustainable
and functional waste management strategies for PET incor-
porating biomedical materials, including orthodontic
aligners, in line with wider aims for a circular economy
and responsible environmental practices in healthcare [8]
and bioremediation of PET waste through microbial consor-
tia–mediated biodegradation has emerged as a viable path-
way. The integrated e ﬀects of microbial diversity and
interspecies interactions, which distinguish consortia from
single microbes, include a more extensive enzymatic reper-
toire and greater resilience to environmental changes [9].
Cooperation in this way can help promote the decomposi-
tion of complex polymers via sequential or parallel enzy-
matic reactions until the polymers are ultimately
mineralized into environmentally friendly substances [10].
Microbial PET degradation pathways have been elucidated,
with some of the greatest progress occurring following the
discovery ofIdeonella sakaiensis–driven production of cata-
lytic enzymes PETase and MHETase, which hydrolyze PET
back to its monomers, terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene
glycol (EG) [11]. Studies that followed have looked at opti-
mizing microbial consortia with the species that produce
PETase, improving the stability of the enzyme itself and
engineering microbes for better PET degradation eﬃciency
[12]. Such advances have speciﬁc pertinence to the PET
waste produced from biomedical applications, where con-
ventional recycling paths are constrained by contamination
and mixed material feedstock [13]. In this review, current
research on microbial consortium–mediated PET degrada-
tion for biomedical plastics such as orthodontic aligners is
critically reviewed (Table 1). This review seeks to deﬁne
enzymatic and microbial mechanisms, determine challenges
that are both process scale and environmental constraints,
and discuss novel approaches to biotechnological innovation
toward sustainable use and management of dental material
waste.
1.1. Background on PET Usage in Orthodontic Aligners.PET
is a semicrystalline thermoplastic polyester with a wide
range of utility in a number of biomedical and industrial
applications. The molecular architecture of this polymer is
its repeating ester linkage between TPA and EG, producing
a polymer chain having a highly stable aromatic backbone
(Figure 1). PET exhibits considerable mechanical strength,
chemical resistance, and thermal stability as a result of this
structural conﬁguration, enabling the material for applica-
tions that demand high performance like food packaging,
textiles, and medical devices [20]. Proven to be biocompati-
ble and possessing suitable physical properties, PET has been
established for use in the fabrication of orthodontic aligners,
in which material transparency,ﬂexibility, and durability are
important. Materials that can withstand the biomechanical
forces involved in moving teeth while providing a deceiv-
ingly long wearing period and do not dent or diminish in
aesthetics are necessary in orthodontic aligner production.
These criteria are fulﬁlled by PET, which conforms to the
manufacture of optical devices and provides a clear, glass-
like transparency resulting in the near invisibility of the
aligners during use and helps in patient acceptance [21].
Additionally, its semicrystalline nature makes PETﬂexible,
which allows aligners to adapt exactly to particular dental
arches, providing the necessary controlled orthodontic
forces for successful tooth repositioning.
Rapid uptake in demand for clear aligner therapy over
the past decade was a result of technology and consumer
preference shifts toward less-invasive, more cosmetically
favorable orthodontic options. On the one hand, traditional
ﬁxed metal braces are eﬀective but have an aesthetic draw-
back; meanwhile, they constitute problems when it comes
to oral hygiene, something that clear aligners can handle.
Aligners made from PET represent a removable, comfort-
able, and discreet option for a wide demographic range of
patients, including teenage and adult patients that look for
orthodontic correction but without the perception or dis-
comfort of the conventional appliances [22]. The usage of
PET aligners with dental care has globally appeared clini-
cally, in accordance with the development of digital den-
tistry, 3D printing technology, and computer-aided design/
manufacturing (CAD/CAM) technology, which helps pre-
cise customization of Invisalign by using patient-speci ﬁc
dental scans [23]. Although PET has favorable clinical and
material properties, the posttreatment waste management
issues associated with PET will be discussed. Unfortunately,
PET’s biodegradation-resistant chemical robustness — the
backbone to its performance— is not prone to degradation
by microbes. Under natural environmental conditions, its
aromatic polyester backbone makes this synthetic recalci-
trant to hydrolytic and enzymatic breakdown, resulting in
long persistence in waste streams [24]. As orthodontic treat-
ment protocols generally tend to last several months to
years, patients are required to replace aligners every 1–2
weeks. Due to repeated disposal, cascading eﬀects of some
large quantities of biomedical plastic waste (mainly PET)
are generated in both clinical and domestic settings [25].
The accumulation of such polymeric waste has environmen-
tal connotations that require the generation of innovative
recycling and disposal methodologies that are appropriate
speciﬁcally for the special PET application in orthodontic
applications. Solving these problems is fundamental to pro-
tect the environmental sustainability of the bene ﬁts of
advanced orthodontic treatment.
1.2. Environmental Concerns of PET Accumulation and
Plastic Waste From Dental Appliances.PET use in orthodon-
tic aligners has proliferated to the point where environmen-
tal footprints have grown alarmingly large, and there are
fears about the long-term ecological legacy from discarded
dental plastics. PET has a density of 1.35 g cm
3 and is struc-
turally inert, with a high aromatic ester containing a
2 International Journal of Microbiology
plurality of aromatic ester linkages that impede various deg-
radation mechanisms, including photolytic, hydrolytic, and
microbial processes [26]. Therefore, PET waste generated
by orthodontic applications typically lingers in the environ-
ment for decades or even longer, in landﬁll sites or dis-
charged through inappropriate disposal pathways into
aquatic systems. This persistence contributes to the global
crisis of plastic pollution in which microplastic contamina-
tion is an emergent environmental threat; that is, the plastic
particles are smaller than 5 mm and widely spread over the
environment [27]. In the dental sector, clinics and ortho-
dontic practices create large amounts of PET waste from dis-
carded aligners, quantities of packaging materials, and
related biomedical plastics. Most of the latter are disposed
of through conventional methods such as landﬁlling and
incineration, which are environmentally dangerous. Land-
ﬁlling PET waste results in long-term environmental persis-
tence and has the capability for additive leaching and
microplastic formation through physical fragmentation pro-
cesses. These microplastics may then be transported into soil
and groundwater systems and become a threat to terrestrial
organisms and may lead to human water supply contamina-
tion [28]. In the reduction of throughput but not in the toxic
release of dioxins, furans, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocar-
bons which contribute to air pollution and elevated green-
house gas emissions exacerbating climate change [29]. The
disposal costs faced by these routes underline the deﬁciency
of the present waste management for the biomedical PET
plastics. The ecological and human health concerns associ-
ated with microplastics that derive from the fragmentation
of discarded PET aligners are of particular interest. Small
size, high surface area-to-volume ratio, and high mobility
make microplastics facile vehicles of environmental contam-
inants like heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants, and
microbial pathogens [30]. Adsorption of toxic substances
to sediment facilitates their bioaccumulation in aquatic and
terrestrial food webs, withﬂow through organisms at higher
trophic levels, such as humans, while life experiment results
have revealed that ingestion and inhalation of microplastics
can lead to adverse biological eﬀects such as inﬂammation,
oxidative stress, and disturbance of endocrine function
[31]. In addition, the presence of microplastics can inhibit
feeding, subsequent reproduction, and growth among many
wildlife species, thereby aﬀecting biodiversity and ecosystem
resilience [32]. With such multidimensional impacts, the
environmental implications of PET waste from orthodontic
devices call for immediate action in managing waste sustain-
ably by overcoming distinctive biomedical plastic pollution
issues.
1.3. Importance of Biodegradation as a Sustainable Solution.
Biodegradation has become an attractive and sustainable
solution in response to the environmental problems associ-
ated with PET accumulation. By following the natural meta-
bolic capabilities of existing microorganisms, this approach
utilizes their enzymatic activity to break down complex
polymers into environmentally benign products: carbon
dioxide, water, and biomass, helping reduce the environ-
mental persistence of plastic waste [10, 33]. While physical
recycling can lead to downcycling or is energy intensive
and chemical recycling can produce hazardous intermedi-
ates during the process, biodegradation provides the ability
to completely mineralize PET under ambient conditions
consistent with the principles of green chemistry and circu-
lar bioeconomy. Synergistic interactions and metabolically
complementary enzymatic arsenals in complex communities
of diverse bacterial and fungal species, termed microbial
consortia, have shown the ability to degrade PET better rel-
ative to monocultures [34]. In these consortia, these consor-
tia utilize cooperative metabolic pathways comprising
distinct microorganisms that perform sequential or parallel
degradation steps to address the metabolic bottlenecks that
obstruct PET degradation in single-strain systems [35].
Recently, speci ﬁc PET-degrading enzymes, especially
PETase and MHETase from I. sakaiensis, were identiﬁed
and characterized to identify the molecular mechanisms of
PET polymer chains cleavage into monomeric units (TPA
and EG), which are then assimilated as carbon sources
[36]. Enzymatic depolymerization of PET represents a cru-
cial ﬁrst step, facilitating further microbial metabolism and
mineralization of PET. The combination of biotechnology
and sustainable waste management in PET waste from

dental plastics, such as orthodontic aligners, is based on an
application of microbial consortia–mediated biodegradation.
By not only reducing the environmental load of biomedical
plastic disposal but also transforming waste into value-
added bioproducts or harmless metabolites, this strategy
can support future sustainable practices in healthcare. In
addition, progress in metabolic engineering, synthetic biol-
ogy, and process development appears to be propelling the
bio-based microbial PET degradation systems toward their
potential scalability and practical implementation [11, 37].
Herein, we synthesize current knowledge regarding micro-
bial consortium–mediated PET degradation for biomedical
applications. The enzymatic and microbial mechanisms are
critically evaluated, biodegradation performance metrics
are evaluated, eﬃcacy is characterized in terms of inﬂuenc-
ing factors, and the environmental implications of the PET
waste arising from orthodontic devices are reviewed. This
work will identify research gaps and begin to explore emerg-
ing biotechnological innovations to inform and inspire
future eﬀorts for the development of sustainable bioremedi-
ation strategies for PET-based dental plastics.
2. PET: Structure and Properties
2.1. PET in Orthodontic Aligners.A widely used synthetic
polymer, belonging to the polyester group, is PET. Polyesters
are synthesized by the polycondensation reaction between
TPA and EG, forming a linear thermoplastic polymer with
repeating ester functional groups. PET chemistry involves a
combination of aromatic terephthalate units linked with an
aliphatic EG moiety that makes PET rigid and yet at the
same time provides rigidity and ﬂexibility [38, 39]. The
desirable mechanical and chemical properties of PET, com-
bined with its transparency, strength, and durability, result
from this structural composition. Extensive use of PET in
biomedical applications, in large part because of its excellent
tensile strength, optical clarity, and resistance to wear, has
been made in biomedical devices, for example, orthodontic
aligners where aesthetics and biocompatibility are important
factors (Figure 2) [21, 40]. Due to patient preference for
noninvasive and nearly invisible orthodontic treatments,
the demand for PET and its copolymers is also increasing
[41]. In terms of its molecular structure, PET is a semicrys-
talline polymeric material that gives both amorphous and
crystalline parts. PET can have its degree of crystallinity
ranging from 20% to 60% depending on processing condi-
tions and heat history [42]. Crystalline domains form
directly from the ordered packing of polymer chains, pro-
moting tensile strength, stiﬀness, and chemical resistance
of the polymer. Its transparency and impact resistance are
due, conversely, to the amorphous regions. The nature of
this dual-phase morphology allows PET to trade oﬀ between
optical clarity and mechanical robustness, both of which are
important for the use of PET in biomedical applications, for
example, as an orthodontic aligner [43]. Due to the impor-
tance of crystallinity in aligner manufacturing, an accurate
balance of crystallinity is important, as excessive crystallinity
causes decreased transparency, while insuﬃcient crystallin-
ity decreases mechanical properties.
PET’s glass transition temperature (Tg) and melting
temperature (Tm) deﬁne the thermal properties of PET.
PET has a Tg of 70
°C–80°C, above which temperature the
polymer changes from a rigid glassy state to a moreﬂexible
rubbery state. That thermal stabilization of the crystalline
fraction is indicated by a Tm of 245
°C–265°C [44]. The ther-
mal characteristics of PET determine its processing window
and end-use performance. PET sheets are dimensionally sta-
ble at oral usage since the Tg is above human body temper-
ature [45] and, for example, PET sheets are thermoformed at
elevated temperatures to manufacture orthodontic aligners.
A second key property of PET is the resultant aromatic poly-
ester backbone that imparts excellent chemical resistance.
PET is, in general, resistant to hydrolysis and many solvents
under neutral and mildly acidic or basic conditions due to
the stability of ester linkages [46]. Nevertheless, hydrolytic
cleavage of the ester bonds of the polymer can occur with
prolonged exposure to strong alkaline or acidic environ-
ments, elevated temperatures, or the action of enzymes
resulting in polymer chain scission. PET has inherited this
resistance to degradation as the reason for them to persist
in the environment and biomedical wastes, making them
diﬃcult to recycle and dispose of [47]. The mechanical and
chemical properties of PET, coupled with its excellent
dimensional stability and substantial biocompatibility, have
made it ideal for use with direct intraoral applications such
as for clear orthodontic aligners [48]. By engineering the
polymer’s surface to enhance its wettability and reduce bac-
terial adhesion, the polymer is hygienically suitable and
patient-safe [49]. In addition, PET has optical clarity, so
aligners can be almost invisible when worn, a feature that
is essential in increasing orthodontic treatment compliance
[50]. However, PET is biologically inert and therefore prob-
lematic from an environmental perspective. Although rela-
tively heat stable, common environmental microorganisms
are unable to break down the strong aromatic ester bonds,
resulting in accumulation in landﬁlls and natural habitats
[51]. As a result, research has continued into chemical and
enzymatic degradation pathways of PET designed to degrade
its structure in order to reduce its environmental footprint
while preserving the functional bene ﬁt in medical
devices [52].

the polycondensation reaction between TPA (or its dimethyl
ester) and EG. The resulting polymer consists of repeating
ester linkages (-COO-) that connect aromatic terephthalate
units to aliphatic EG segments [53]. The chemical structure
can be represented as repeating units of [−O − CH2 − CH2
− O − CO − C
6H4 − CO−]n[-O-CH_2-CH_2-O-CO-C6H4-
CO-]n[−O − CH2 − CH2 − O − CO − C6H4 − CO−]n.
The semicrystalline nature of PET arises from the com-
bination of a rigid aromatic ring and ﬂexible aliphatic
chains. Its mechanical and optical properties vary depending
on the variation of the degree of crystallinity, ranging from
20% to 60%, depending on the processing and thermal his-
tory [54]. Tensile strength, stiﬀness, and chemical resistance
are generated by crystalline domains of closely packed poly-
mer chains, whereas amorphous regions endure impact and
optical clarity [55]. PET has a Tg of 70
°C–80°C, separating
the rigid and rubbery states, and a Tm of 245°C–265°C, at
the melting of the crystalline region [56]. By deﬁning these
parameters, the processing window for thermoforming of
PET sheets into orthodontic aligners is established, with
dimensional stability required in service at body tempera-
ture. But strong acids or bases or enzymatic attack can
hydrolyze the ester bonds and cause polymer chain scission
[57, 58]. Physically, PET is hydrophobic, of high molecular
weight, and has, over the past 50 years, been associated with
problems for biodegradation due to its low water uptake and
poor microbial colonization capabilities. The physicochemi-
cal aspects of PET give it high tensile strength, excellent
dimensional stability, and optical clarity, leading to the use
of transparent medical devices in orthodontic aligners. Wet-
tability and bacterial adhesion are minimized, improving
biocompatibility, through surface modiﬁcations [59]. The
combination of its properties enables widespread adoption
of PET in biomedical and packaging industries.
2.3. Application of PET in Orthodontic Aligners and Dental
Devices. PET possesses unique mechanical properties, opti-
cal clarity, and biocompatibility, which have made it an ideal
material for manufacturing clear orthodontic aligners and
other dental devices. Dentists now have a virtually invisible,
removable alternative to traditional metal braces to help
with orthodontic alignment that has revolutionized dental
treatment and made it more comfortable and a lot easier
for the patient to comply [60]. PET’s transparent nature
allows aesthetically pleasing aligners to maintain a closeﬁt
to dental anatomy, allowing eﬀective tooth movement with-
out the need for the wearer to draw attention to them. As a
semicrystalline, PET oﬀers the strength and stiﬀness needed
to apply controlled orthodontic forces without deformation
in use [61]. The thermoforming of sheets into accurate den-
tal impressions, along with a priori customizedﬁt, is made
possible by its thermal properties. Wound healing for PET
(Tg ~70
°C–80°C) with predictable and consistent outcomes
[62] has been enabled by its dimensional stability within
the temperature range of the oral cavity. But it is not just
limited to aligners; PET is also used in temporary crowns,
bridges, and splints because it is durable and easy to fab.
In its surface, it can be modiﬁed to resist bacterial coloniza-
tion and prevent oral infections during prolonged wear [63].
Moreover, PET is recyclable and can be reprocessed, making
it an environmentally sustainable option for dental material
management [13]. Most recently, innovations have focused
on PET copolymers and blends to improve mechanicalﬂex-
ibility and mitigate the tensile stress relaxation seen in pure
PET within long-term orthodontic environments [64]. Cur-
rent research also explores combining antimicrobial agents
with PET matrices for improved oral hygiene during ortho-
dontic treatment.
3. Challenges in PET Degradation due to Its
Recalcitrant Nature
PET has very favorable properties for medical and packaging
applications but has a chemistry and semicrystalline struc-
ture that makes it extremely recalcitrant to natural degrada-
tion processes. However, the aromatic ester bonds that
comprise the backbone of PET are characterized by high
tensile strength and chemical resistance, but they are also
rendered low sensitive to hydrolytic or enzymatic cleavage
at ambient conditions [65]. PET’s hydrophobicity and high
molecular weight limit microbial colonization and enzyme
access into this polymer, thereby inhibiting biodegradation
in soil and aquatic environments [66]. Additionally, the
semicrystalline morphology also enhances the degradation
resistance, as the crystalline regions restrict water diﬀusion
and enzyme inﬁltration, while the amorphous regions are
easier to get to but represent a smaller fraction of the whole
polymer [67]. Surface cracking and embrittlement may be
induced by environmental factors, for example, UV radia-
tion and thermal oxidation, slightly increasing susceptibility,
but such abiotic processes are slow enough and ineﬀective
for substantial degradation of PET [68]. Traditional waste
management methods, for example, incineration and land-
ﬁlls, are polluted, and the last value of material is lost, stres-
sing the necessity for eﬀective recycling or biodegradation
technologies [69]. However, microbial degradation by spe-
cialized bacteria and fungi producing PETase and MHETase
enzymes has been promising, albeit very slow and contin-
gent on optimized environmental conditions [11], and due
to the recalcitrance of PET, novel production strategies that
fuse enzymatic formations of Marcelo, celery, and microbial
consortia and subject the material to redesign in a manner
that enhances biodegradability are desirable. Incomplete
simultaneous mineralization of organics is a challenge, as is
integration into existing waste management systems and
scale-up of bioprocesses. Since PET use is increasing in med-
ical devices such as orthodontic aligners [70], these barriers
must be overcome to reduce PET’s environmental impact.
3.1. Environmental Impact of PET Waste From Orthodontic
Aligners. With increasing global demand for clear orthodon-
tic aligners, fabricated predominantly from PET and its
copolymers, there has been an increasing generation of bio-
medical plastic waste associated with high environmental
concern. The lifespan of orthodontic aligners is generally
1–2 weeks long; it is easy to imagine that many tons of mate-
rials based on PET are sent to the dump every year [1]. Con-
ventional plastics used in packaging enter separate waste
5International Journal of Microbiology
ﬂows but typically stillﬂow into landﬁlls and incineration
plants, which can have a very detrimental environmental
impact [71]. PET is a highly stable aromatic polyester back-
bone, resulting in physical, chemical, and biological inert-
ness. The stability of this polymer helps keep it around for
so long; PET waste will persist in the environment for hun-
dreds of years, with or without active recycling and degrada-
tion [47, 72]. Thus, the accumulation of discarded
orthodontic aligners contributes to the growing plastic pol-
lution problem that adversely disrupts habitat for terrestrial
and aquatic ecosystems and releases microplastics [73]. Per-
sistent organic pollutants and heavy metals, which bioaccu-
mulate in food chains, are also readily adsorbed on
fragmented PET, making microplastics derived from frag-
mented PET a risk to wildlife and human health (Figure 3)
[74]. Additionally, existing disposal methods of PET-
containing orthodontic wastes only add to environmental
problems. However, long-term sequestration occurs as PET
reaches the landﬁll, although there is a risk of leachate gen-
eration and contamination of soil. Despite reducing solid
waste volume, incineration can release toxic gases such as
dioxins and furans, contributing to air pollution and leading
to associated health risks [75]. The specialized nature of den-
tal waste and the absence of protocols for standardized recy-
cling employed for other types of PET materials prevent
eﬀective diversion of waste in addition to the recovery of
resources that otherwise could be utilized. With the carbon
footprint created by the manufacture, distribution, and dis-
posal of PET aligners adding to greenhouse gas emissions
and contributing to climate change [76], the urgent need
for sustainable management strategies for biomedical plas-
tics is highlighted because the cumulative environmental
burden of PET waste is presented, developing biodegradable
or bio-based alternatives, enhancement of microbial degra-
dation technologies, and circular economy principles within
the orthodontic practice [77].
3.2. Quanti ﬁcation of PET Waste From Orthodontic
Practices. The popularity of clear orthodontic aligners made
from PET or its copolymers has dramatically increased the
amount of biomedical plastic waste being produced across
the world by orthodontic practices. Unlike traditionalﬁxed
appliances, PET aligners are replaced frequently, from 1 to
2 weeks, to incrementally change the teeth’s position, lead-
ing to the disposal of many PET aligners by one patient
over one treatment cycle [78]. On average, an orthodontic
patient uses between 20 and 40 PET aligners during treat-
ment— that is several hundred grams of plastic waste [1].
Aggregated over millions of patients globally, the cumula-
tive volume of PET waste generated by orthodontic aligners
demonstrates signiﬁcance and is now being measured at
dental clinics through surveys and waste audits, in which
the plastic components of orthodontic materials, including
aligners, are reported to elevate the level of biomedical plas-
tic waste. For instance, a study estimated a single large
orthodontic practice to produce 15 –20 kg of PET waste
annually from aligner disposal alone [79]. This number
does not include other PET-based consumables such as
retainers and thermoformed splints. For instance, projec-
tions indicate that the clear aligner market will grow rap-
idly, at a compound annual growth rate of over 20% in a
few years to come [80], and with that growth will come a
rise in PET waste production. As such, quanti ﬁcation
eﬀorts have also been directed toward microplastic release
during the use and disposal of aligners. PET micro- and
nanoparticles that are released intraorally and in the envi-
ronment after disposal are themselves potential additional
sources of environmental and health risk due to mechanical
wear and degradation [81]. While these concerns exist, data
on the volume and fate of actual orthodontic PET waste are
limited; yet, based on inconsistent standards and a lack of
centralized collection systems in most regions, quantiﬁca-
tion of orthodontic PET waste emphasizes the need for
the development of new protocols for orthodontic PET
waste management, recycling strategies, and biodegradable
alternatives to redress this growing reservoir of plastic
pollution.
3.3. Persistence of PET in the Environment and Associated
Risks. PET possesses remarkable chemical stability and
physical durability and its persistence in the environmental
compartments: soils, freshwater, and marine environments.
Aromatic ester linkages in PET make PET very resistant to
hydrolysis, oxidation, and microbial degradation and make
PET persist on the timescale of decades to centuries in the
natural environment [82]. This recalcitrance results in the
accumulation of PET debris and microplastics globally in
surface waters and sediments and even in remote areas such
as the Arctic [83], with environmental persistence of PET
from orthodontic aligners and other biomedical waste asso-
ciated with these microplastics a multifaceted risk. While not
all wildlife actually ingest microplastic/mycrobe containing
sorbent particles, any time two items get mixed into one,
there can be health risks, and this is proved [84]. Addition-
ally, PET microplastics also serve as vectors for toxic chemi-
cals which are problematic additives or absorbed
environmental pollutants that bioaccumulate along food
chains and which may also enter human consumers [85]
or PET microplastics and nanoparticles can adsorb persis-
tent organic pollutants and heavy metals and modify their
transport and bioavailability in the environment [86]. Due
to their small size, microplastics can be readily taken up by
many organisms, from plankton to higher trophic levels,

and can result in cellular damage or cause oxidative stress
and inﬂammatory responses [87]. PET particles may change
soil structure and aﬀect aeration and water retention, poten-
tially causing issues for plant growth and soil microbial com-
munities [88], but an important concern in terrestrial
systems is the oral ingestion of microplastics from dental
devices, a relatively new concern, but human health impacts
are not yet well understood and require further study. Also
complicating remediation of PET is its long residence time,
as it does not readily mineralize and thus can persist as a
long-term pollutant. However, these environmental risks
underscore the urgent need to sustainably manage PET
waste and invent biodegradable substitutes to reduce the
ecological footprint of PET.
4. Current Disposal Practices and
Their Limitations
Disposal of PET waste from orthodontic aligners represents
an enormous challenge for biomedical waste management
systems. Land ﬁlling, incineration, and less frequently
mechanical recycling are common disposal methods, but
each has serious limitations. Despite that, landﬁlling remains
the major method for disposing of these wastes, particularly
in those areas that do not possess specialized medical waste
treatment infrastructure. PET waste deposited at a landﬁll
will be sequestered, but environmental persistence can lead
to decades of survival as the polymer remains intact [89].
While PET waste can be destroyed by incineration to reduce
volume and potentially recover energy, poor control can
result in dioxins, furans, and particulate matter emissions
[90]. Incineration emissions pose an environmental and
health concern, especially in densely populated areas where
incinerators operate without modern scrubbing technologies
for the emission of noxious gases from the combustion of
PET orthodontic waste [75]. Mechanical recycling of ortho-
dontic waste is constrained by contamination, the absence of
segregation, and thermal degradation of the polymer quality
during repeated processing [91]. The recovery and recycling
of biomedical plastics are often complicated by mixing them
in streams of other infectious waste. Furthermore, the lim-
ited volume and unique nature of orthodontic PET waste
eliminate economic motivations for dedicated recycling sys-
tems, and chemical recycling techniques such as glycolysis or
hydrolysis present the potential for depolymerization of PET
to yield monomers that can be repolymerized; however,
these require high costs and technical complexity [92]. Addi-
tionally, there is no standardization of protocols for PET
orthodontic material collection and disposal, which are fur-
ther contributing to environmental leakage and land ﬁll
buildup, and the current disposal practices are inadequate
to limit the overall environmental impact of the PET waste
from the orthodontic aligners. Innovative, sustainable waste
management strategies, including alternatives like biode-
gradable ones, microbial degradation technologies, and
improved regulatory approaches to recycling, are in dire
need for support of recycling and minimization of ecological
footprint.
4.1. Microbial Degradation of PET: An Overview.Synthetic
polyester PET has good durability and is chemically resistant
and is consequently widely used for packaging and biomed-
ical applications. But recalcitrant it is and that makes life
hellish on the environment because it lasts for decades in
ecosystems. The biotechnological solution to the plastic pol-
lution problem is microbial degradation of PET employing
microorganisms capable of hydrolyzing ester bonds in the
polymer backbone (Figure 4) [93]. PET hydrolases such as
PETase and MHETase are key enzyme catalysts of PET
depolymerization to its monomer, TPA and EG [94]. In
2016, the discovery ofI. sakaiensis was a milestone in the
diversiﬁcation; this bacterium has both PETase and MHE-
Tase, allowing eﬃcient PET degradation under laboratory
conditions. Since then, various homologous enzymes and
additional PET-degrading microbes have been identiﬁed in
diverse environments [65]; microbial consortia consisting
of bacteria and fungi with complementary enzymatic capa-
bilities can degrade PET better than each individual strain.
In turn, the sequential enzymatic steps of these consortia
together could synergistically degrade PET, increase hydro-
lysis rates, and also expand environmental adaptability
[95]. Temperature, pH, PET crystallinity, and surface prop-
erties are, in fact, all factors that strongly inﬂuence biodegra-
dation eﬃciency. Despite progress, however, microbial PET
degradation still has challenges, including slow degradation
rates, incomplete mineralization, and scalability of biopro-
cesses [69]. For example, amorphous PET regions degrade
faster than highly crystalline domains with better enzyme
accessibility. The use of protein engineering to engineer
PET hydrolases has improved enzyme stability and activity
and has improved their feasibility for industrial applications
[96]. In addition, the immobilization techniques and the bio-
reactor designs are being optimized for better degradation
under controlled conditions. In general, microbial degrada-
tion of PET constitutes a promising and sustainable alterna-
tive to mechanical or chemical recycling. Breaking down the
remaining limitations requires continued research in order
to reach large-scale biodegradation large enough to reduce
PET pollution in the environment appreciably and scale
toward a circular bioeconomy.
4.2. Types of Microorganisms Known for PET Degradation.A
number of microorganisms— bacteria, fungi, and actinomy-
cetes— mediate the microbial degradation of PET employing
a complex array of enzymatic capabilities leading to partial
or even total breakdown of this recalcitrant polymer. PET
degraders are the most extensively studied bacteria, several
of which are capable of hydrolyzing PET into the mono-
meric components. Although the discovery ofI. sakaiensis
from a PET-contaminated environment was a groundbreak-
ing one, enabling the isolation of a bacterium specializing in
the depolymerization of PET by a speciﬁc enzymatic system
composed of PETase and MHETase enzymes catalyzed the
depolymerization of PET into TPA and EG. Beyond I.
sakaiensis, the bacterial generaPseudomonas, Bacillus, Ther-
mobiﬁda, and Cutinimonas have been reported to degrade
PET or PET-like polyesters by secreting extracellular hydro-
lases [97]. Fungi serve important roles in PET degradation,
7International Journal of Microbiology
particularly through the secretion of a diverse set of extracel-
lular enzymes capable of degrading more complex polymers,
and such bacteria reside in environments rich in organic
polymers such as compost, landﬁll soils, and wastewater
treatment plants. Ligninolytic enzymes of white-rot fungi
such asPhanerochaete chrysosporium and Trametes versico-
lor, namely, laccases and peroxidases, have been well recog-
nized to oxidatively degrade synthetic polymers (PET) [14].
Further, species of Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Penicillium
isolated from plastic-polluted environments have been
shown to catalyze PET degradation, often in consortia with
bacteria [16]. Generally, fungal degradation runs slower than
bacterial degradation; however, it can accelerate under par-
ticular circumstances. Filamentous Gram-positive bacteria,
actinomycetes, are recognized for their potent enzymatic
toolkit for the degradation of recalcitrant compounds and
bridge the characteristics of fungi and bacteria. Cutinases
and polyesterases capable of hydrolyzing PET substrates
have been reported for the species of Thermobiﬁda and
Streptomyces [19]. Theﬁlamentous growth of actinomycetes
enables them to colonize the solid surfaces of plastic mate-
rials, making enzymatic access possible. Their thermophilic
variants facilitate PET degradation at elevated temperatures,
which is advantageous for industrial bioprocesses; however,
through synergistic metabolic activities in microbial consor-
tia, these microorganisms often enhance the rates of PET
degradation beyond those that can be achieved with a single
strain. Consortia such as these have complementary enzyme
expression, improved colonization, and adaptation to envi-
ronmental stresses [98].
4.3. Microorganisms Known for PET Degradation: Bacteria,
Fungi, and Actinomycetes. PET is an important durable
polymeric material currently employed in packaging, tex-
tiles, and biomedical devices such as orthodontic aligners.
Widespread exposure of PET in the environment has stimu-
lated intense research into microbial pathways for degrada-
tion, and bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes have been
identiﬁed as potential key players in degrading this polymer,
enzymatically breaking down into monomers. Cultured bac-
teria, especially I. sakaiensis, identiﬁed, have been the most
studied PET degraders. Ceramides are then dispatched to
normally aerated muscles, where they taxi away from the
injury and away from the otherwise previously ﬂightless
neighbors that have had their wings torn oﬀ. Where ﬂies
sense an edge condition, theﬂy’s behavior is altered, with
previous ﬂightless neighbors regaining theirﬂight capability
[99]. Other bacterial genera, however, includingThermobi-
ﬁda, Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Rhodococcus, andCutinimonas,
have been shown to degrade PET using extracellular polyes-
terases and cutinases [65, 82]. Of special note is PET hydro-
lysis conducted by thermostable enzymes secreted by
thermophilic bacteria such asT. fusca, which are active at
elevated temperatures and thus greatly accelerate PET
hydrolysis [19]; fungi are major participants in PET degra-
dation due to their powerful oxidative enzymes.P. chrysos-
porium and T. versicolor, white-rot fungi, produce laccases
and peroxidases that will oxidize aromatic rings of PET,
weakening its structure and making it hydrolytic cleavage
susceptible [14]. While many bacterial species have also been
found to be able to hydrolyze PET-like polyesters, including
P. putida, there are also other fungal species known to
hydrolyze PET-like polyesters such asAspergillus, Fusarium,
and Penicillium, typically in synergy with bacteria [100].
Biodegradation typically occurs more slowly by fungi than
by bacteria, but fungi have a vital role in the complex
microbe community by changing the chemical surface of
PET and making it more accessible. Actinomycetes,ﬁlamen-
tous bacteria with fungal-like characteristics, have been
found to contain very diverse extracellular enzymes, includ-
ing cutinases and polyester hydrolases. Among these species,
T. fusca, S. viridis, Micromonospora
, and Nocardiopsis are
known for their hydrolysis of PETs in particularly well-
composed environments, with organic matter [97]. PET
can be degraded by actinomycetes at high temperatures; in
addition, ﬁlamentous growth of actinomycetes assists in col-
onizing plastic surfaces, which increases degradation rates.
Next to individual strains, microbial consortia containing
bacteria, fungi, and actinomycetes have shown more PET-
degrading activity than monocultures due to their having
robust enzymes under industrial conditions that are attrac-
tive for biotechnological application (Table 2). Sequential
and complementary enzyme actions are facilitated by syner-
gistic interactions, allowing oxidative enzymes from fungi
[101] to oxidize PET surfaces, increasing the accessibility
of bacterial hydrolase to PET. The concept of“adaptation”
to environmental stresses is explored as one of the reasons
these consortia obtain more eﬃcient degradation and sup-
port their potential for PET bioremediation.
5. Enzymatic Mechanisms Involved in
PET Breakdown
Specialized enzymes that catalyze the hydrolysis of PET ester
bonds drive its fundamental microbial degradation, whereby
the polymer is hydrolyzed into its monomeric constituents,
TPA and EG. The most widely studied of these enzymes
are PETase and MHETase, comprising the most eﬃcient
two-step enzymatic system to date, found inI. sakaiensis
[102]. Structurally, PETase is a serine hydrolase, with a cleft
for binding the substrate, optimized for accommodating the
PET polymeric chain to target for cleavage. Since PETase
activity, MHETase hydrolyzes mono (2-hydroxyethyl) tere-
phthalate (MHET) into TPA and EG, ﬁnishing the

depolymerization pathway; protein engineering eﬀorts fur-
ther improved its catalytic eﬃciency and thermostability,
broadening its potential application (Figure 5) [52]. This
enzyme shows high speciﬁcity for MHET to avoid accumu-
lation of toxic intermediates and enhance downstream
microbial metabolism [36]. Along with the enzymes
described above, the enzymes ofI. sakaiensistogether make
a surprisingly eﬀective PET degrader. For example, thermo-
stable F. cutinases and polyesterases from Fusarium spp.
drill into the surface of the amorphous regions of PET
[103]. Degradation of PET is typically enzymatic and is gen-
erally said to proceed through adsorption to the PET surface,
polymer chain cleavage, and desorption of the products;
recent advances suggest the critical role of enzyme synergy
and structural adaptations that improve access to PET ’s
semicrystalline regions. Enzyme performance is further
enhanced by immobilization and optimization of reaction
conditions to make the enzymes useful for phytoremediation
and recycling applications.
6. Microbial Consortia Versus Single
Microorganism Approaches
6.1. Concept and Advantages of Microbial Consortia in
Biodegradation. Microbial consortia are structured commu-
nities of two or more microbial species that interact syner-
gistically or complementarily for functions typically
impossible or too ineﬃcient to be accomplished by a single
microorganism (Figure 6). Consortia take advantage of the
diﬀering metabolic capabilities and enzyme repertoires of
diverse microbes to degrade complex pollutants such as syn-
thetic polymers more readily. Compared to monocultures,
microbial consortia exhibit ecological robustness, metabolic
versatility, and functional redundancy and can tolerate
diverse and dynamic environmental conditions [104]. In this
regard, microbial consortia are able to divide complex bio-
chemical pathways among diﬀerent species. Depolymeriza-
tion of polymer by one organism creates intermediate
compounds to beﬁnished oﬀ by the further action of other
members, which reduces feedback inhibition and achieves
complete mineralization [105]. Division of labor results in
a lower metabolic burden for individual microbes and in
ineﬀective utilization of substrates. Consortia also possess
enhanced tolerance to environmental stresses such as pH
shifts, temperature ﬂuctuations, and toxic intermediates,
although members provide synergistic protection and
resource sharing [9]. However, a single microorganism can
produce only one or two relevant enzymes, whereas consor-
tia can express a complete ensemble of enzymes convention-
ally used to speed up the process of breakdown and increase
degradation rates [106]. In addition, microbial consortia can
promote bioﬁlm formation on plastic surfaces to increase
localized enzyme concentration and substrate contact time,
which enhances biodegradation [107]. As such, microbial
consortia provide a systems-based and ecologically mean-
ingful way to address bioremediation, improving eﬃciency,
resilience, and scalability of PET degradation and other envi-
ronmental interventions.
6.2. Synergistic Interactions Enhancing PET Degradation.
Synergistic interactions between microbial communities are
essential for enhancing the degradation of PET and other
persistent polymers. Metabolic cooperation, enzymatic com-
plementarity, and environmental modi ﬁcation are three
forms of these interactions that allow the breakdown of sub-
strates through greater eﬃciency. Metabolic cooperation is a
form of interaction between microbial populations involving
the indirect cooperation in degrading a substrate, in which
intermediate degradation products generated by one popula-
tion serve as substrates for another. For example, it is known
that polymer hydrolysis proceeds from the polymer to
MHET or to TPA, which, in turn, some microbes may accu-
mulate to inhibitory levels. The continuous polymer degra-
dation is prevented by accumulation or feedback inhibition
by the presence of other species that can metabolize these
intermediates [108]. The sequential metabolism also
increases the overall mineralization rate at the expense of
breakdown products. Another important mechanism by
which microorganisms obtain complementarity in enzy-
matic processing is enzymatic complementarity, in which
diﬀerent microorganisms produce distinct enzymes that act
on various bonds and structural features of PET. One
microbe might secrete PETase directed at ester bonds while
another secretes oxidative enzymes such as laccases or per-
oxidases to modify aromatic rings, thus making the substrate
more susceptible to hydrolysis [18]. The combination of this
multienzyme system broadens the range of degradable PET
fractions, most notably the crystalline domains that are typ-
ically resistant to degradation; environmental modiﬁcation
includes microenvironmental modiﬁcation factors such as

pH, oxygen levels, and bioﬁlm matrix composition dictated
by members of these consortia. Synergistic extracellular
polymeric substances (EPSs) that are produced by a number
of bacteria and fungi facilitate the formation of bioﬁlms on
the PET surface, concentrating enzymes and providing bet-
ter contact with the substrate [109]. Alternatively, others
are able to locally modify the pH or secrete surfactants that
increase the PET wettability, thereby promoting enzyme
adsorption and enzyme activity [110].
6.3. Examples of Consortia Used for PET or Similar Polymer
Degradation. It has been shown in several studies that
microbial consortia degrade PET and related polymers bet-
ter than single strains. For instance, a consortium of three
organisms, I. sakaiensis, P. putida, and Bacillus subtilis, was
able to enhance PET degradation with a combination of syn-
ergistic hydrolytic and oxidative activities under composting
conditions [16, 111]. In marine environments,T. versicolor
and Pseudomonas spp. mixed fungal –bacterial consortia
were eﬀective in degrading PETﬁlms by integrating the fun-
gus laccase-driven oxidative process with bacterial hydroly-
sis [112]. Once again, thermophilic consortia dominated by
T. fuscaand Streptomyces species catalyzed accelerated PET
hydrolysis with thermostable enzymes and may provide
promising industrial-scale applications [19], while landﬁll-
derived microbial communities harboring Streptomyces,
Bacillus, and fungal genera have been identiﬁed to eﬃciently
degrade PET and polyurethane plastics compared to isolated
strains, demonstrating the ecological relevance of consortia
for polymer biodegradation in natural environments [93].
6.4. Microbial Consortium–Mediated PET Degradation in
Orthodontic Aligners. Due to its favorable mechanical
strength, optical clarity, and biocompatibility, PET, which
forms the core polymeric material in many clear orthodontic
aligners, is particularly attractive. The chemical stability and
semicrystalline structure of PET confer remarkable resis-
tance to the natural degradation of PET-based biomedical
wastes, for example, discarded orthodontic aligners in the
environment [113]. This waste will persist and persist and
is ecologically risky stuﬀ, requiring inventive biodegradation.
Microbial consortia have been developed as a potentially
superior solution because their additional enzymatic activi-
ties and synergies can accelerate the eﬃciency of PET degra-
dation beyond that of single microorganisms. Microbial
consortia consist of complex bacterial, fungal, and actinomy-
cete communities whose interlocking metabolism and sup-
porting enzymatic complements lead to a full breakdown
of PET. Unlike monocultures that could deliver a single spe-
ciﬁc enzymatic function, consortia provide a variety of enzy-
matic tools in the larval arsenal (PETases, cutinases, lipases,
esterases or laccases, and peroxidases). The synergistic
action of these enzymes, which attack PET ester bonds, aro-
matic rings, and polymer surface properties, is essential in
allowing for eﬃcient PET depolymerization in PET ortho-
dontic aligners [52, 114]. To use one example, PETase and
MHETase are secreted by bacteria likeI. sakaiensisand allow
them to harvest the monomers EG and TPA from PET. At
the same time, aromatic intermediates are metabolized by
complementary bacteria such as Pseudomonas spp. and
thereby are not allowed to accumulate in toxic amounts.
Simultaneously, fungal members such asT. versicolorrelease
laccases to petrologically modify PET surfaces, thereby
enhancing hydrolytic susceptibility to the bacterial enzyme
[15]. T. cutinases from actinomycetes such as T. fusca
increase degradation rates under industrially relevant condi-
tions and contribute thermostable cutinases [115].
Additionally, microbial consortia are also eﬀective in the
formation of bioﬁlms on the hydrophobic surfaces of the
orthodontic aligners. The bioﬁlm matrix concentrates degra-
dative enzymes in a concentrated environment and increases

substrate contact time, resulting in increased hydrolysis
kinetics [116]. Furthermore, consortia exhibit cooperative
metabolism, which confers resilience to environmental
stresses and thus are apt for application in a waste treatment
facility or composting operation aimed at treating biomedi-
cal plastics, as recent studies have shown microbial consortia
speciﬁcally adapted to degrade PET in orthodontic aligners.
Through optimized conditions, consortia ofIdeonella, Bacil-
lus, and Aspergillus species were shown to dramatically
increase the degradation rates of PET ﬁlms derived from
aligner material, with these consortia achieving substantial
weight loss and surface erosion in less than a week. Besides
that, additional pretreatment techniques such as UV expo-
sure or mechanical fragmentation can enhance microbial
accessibility and hence quicken biodegradation processes
[117]. While signiﬁcant advances have been made toward
microbial-based consortiums, there are still challenges to
scaling microbial consortium–based PET degradation to be
used at the large scale to manage such orthodontic waste.
Further research is required to control community composi-
tion, maintain enzymatic activity under variable environ-
mental conditions, and integrate degradation processes
into existing biomedical waste frameworks. Metagenomics,
synthetic biology, and enzyme engineering advances prom-
ise to enable tailoring consortia that carry optimized PET
degradation pathways for orthodontic applications.
6.5. Speciﬁc Studies on Microbial Consortia Targeting PET in
Orthodontic Aligners. Clear orthodontic aligners made pri-
marily of PET or PET-based copolymer have shown a sub-
stantial increase in their use worldwide because of their
aesthetic and functional advantages. Nevertheless, the recalci-
trance of PET makes the resultant biomedical waste an envi-
ronmental concern. Due to the collective enzymatic diversity
and synergistic capabilities, microbial consortia have been
investigated as promising agents for the biodegradation of
these polymeric materials. Several recent studies have been
devoted to identifying and characterizing microbial consortia
capable of PET degradation from orthodontic aligners. Hold-
ing under bottled laboratory conditions, [18] also reported a
deﬁned consortium includingI. sakaiensis, Bacillus subtilis,
and Aspergillus niger, which degraded the PETﬁlms obtained
from discarded orthodontic aligners. The establishment of the
consortium’se n z y m ep r oﬁle was attained, which was able to
break down more PET than monocultures, and a large surface
erosion was observed (more than 60%) after 30 days of biore-
actor operation. Similarly, Salinas et al. [17] have isolated a
marine-derived fungus–bacteria consortium consisting ofT.
versicolor and P. putida, with evidence for the degradation of
PET substrates similar to aligners through laccase and PETase
synergistic activities.
Speciﬁc research eﬀorts on microbial consortia–driven
degradation of orthodontic aligner PET have increased over
the past few years, with a number of studies leading the wave
showing positive outcomes. The most striking study was
where a consortium that included I. sakaiensis, P. putida,
and B. subtiliswas synthesized. This community was chosen
with caution after the important enzymatic functions, such
as the breaking of PET polymers, TPA derivative metabo-
lisms, and bioﬁlm formation on the surfaces of the polymers,
were deemed complementary [118]. Over 60% mass reduc-
tion was attained by the consortium upon a 30-day bioreac-
tor experiment using PET ﬁlms that were made using
discarded orthodontic aligners [119]. Surface erosion was
determined by SEM, and monomeric degradation products
were released, and the products were conﬁrmed through
FTIR and HPLC, thus showing both physical and chemical
breakdown of the aligner material [120, 121].
A promising development was provided that generated a
marine-derived consortium of T. versicolor and P. putida
[122]. In that arrangement, the fungal component began to
oxidize PET on the surface by secreting laccase, greatly
improving the availability of bacterial PETases [123]. Their
experiment system thermoformed with PET-G sheets made
of orthodontic aligner-grade polymers had a 45% degrada-
tion level after 3 weeks. In this experiment, oxidative pre-
treatment was revealed to be signiﬁcant in improving the
biodegradability of high-crystallinity PET surfaces to micro-
bial degrading activities [124]. Additional experimental
methods have included thermophilic consortia, with species
in them includingT. fuscaand Streptomyces spp. exhibiting
polyesterase and cutinase activity at higher temperatures.
These types of consortia have been model tested in rotating
disc bioreactors run under composting-mimic conditions to
give an expandable format of installing microbial degrada-
tion into biomedical waste systems. In such instances, the
biodegrading process was much slower in aligners that had
not been UV pretreated, which is yet another example of
the importance of treatment of surfaces [120].
With these improvements, literature has continued to say
that the orthodontic PET has a high resistance to wear com-
pared to general beverage PET. Discrepancy is credited to var-
iances in polymer crystallinity, additives copolymerized to
ensure ﬂexibility and clarity, and multilayered structures
employed as an impediment to enzyme penetration. In addi-
tion, dental materials usually possess some kind of plasticizers,
antibacterial agents, or even color to which microbial prolifer-
ation activities may be sensitive, thereby making degradation
kinetics quite cumbersome [125, 126]. The future trend in
the area will look into employing genome engineering tools
to boost the activity of targeted enzymes, developing bioaug-
mentation approaches working with consortia on immobi-
lized carriers, and real-time tracking of biodegradation
processes using omics-based instruments [127, 128]. More-
over, microbial PET degradation incorporated into decentra-
lized treatment units in dental clinics and aligner
manufacturing facilities in general might provide a more via-
ble alternative to incineration and landﬁll systems. Such devel-
opments will not only be promising in terms of environmental
protection but also in sync with the rest of the globe in terms of
attaining a circular and sustainable biomedical economy in
relation to orthodontic practice.
7. Experimental Setups and
Analytical Techniques
Evaluation of the breakdown of PET from orthodontic
aligners by microbial consortia includes keeping samples of
11International Journal of Microbiology
the material under deﬁned or natural types of microbes at
ﬁxed conditions. It is common to keep microbial and enzyme
activities high by running experiments at 30°C–50°Ca n da t
pH values of 7–8 [129]. Usually, commercial aligner sheets
cut to appropriate dimensions serve as PET substrates. These
are normally given a UV treatment or roughened mechani-
cally to improve their surface and make enzymes better able
to access them. In order to observe biodegradation closely,
intermediate sample collection intervals are applied during
the incubation period, which lasts several days or weeks. Rates
of biodegradation are accurately measured using diﬀerent lab-
oratory methods. By using gravimetric methods, it is possible
to estimate and monitor how PET mass is reduced over diﬀer-
ent periods, which gives important data about bulk polymer
degradation. However, due to a lack of sensitivity to small
molecular changes, extra characterization techniques are often
necessary. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), the
group signaled diﬀerent kinds of changes such as pitting,
cracks, loss of material, and bioﬁlm creation that showed
PET was being broken down by physical and enzymatic pro-
cesses [130]. In addition, both Fourier-transform infrared
spectroscopy (FTIR) and x-ray diﬀraction (XRD) give useful
information about the changes in chemicals and structures.
FTIR can spot ester bond splitting and the creation of func-
tional groups, revealing polymer damage, and XRD highlights
lower crystallinity, meaning the polymer chains have been dis-
rupted and microbial enzymes can reach them more easily
[131]. HPLC and GC-MS detect degradation ingredients like
MHET, TPA, and EG to uncover the degradation mechanisms
and conﬁrm the success of bioenzymatic methods. In addition,
doing assays for PETase, MHETase, laccase, and cutinase gives
a clear picture of how well the consortium can degrade various
materials. Although experiments in the laboratory showed
that about 10%–35% of the material decomposed within 30–
60 days, more adjustments are needed to reach standards
important for industry and economics (Figure 7).
8. Factors Influencing PET Biodegradation
The way bacteria degrade PET aligners depends on the mix
of microbes, the conditions in the environment, and intrin-
sic features of the aligners. Synergy among bacteria and
fungi with di ﬀerent functions and enzymatic reactions
encourages complete polymer degradation [33]. Factors in
the environment aﬀecting biodegradation mainly depend
on temperature, the level of acidity, and whether there is
enough oxygen. Both enzyme eﬃciency and the number of
microbes increase when temperatures range from 30
°Ct o
50°C and pH levels are near or slightly above neutral. More-
over, when conditions are aerobic, the enzymes required to
break down PET (depolymerize) function more eﬀectively
than under anaerobic conditions [132].
Both the crystallinity and surface features of the substrate
greatly determine how quickly biodegradation will occur.
Orthodontic aligner PET usually demonstrates good crystal-
linity and hydrophobicity, which help it in the clinic but harm
its ability to break down. Crystalline materials block the access
of enzymes to the polymer because they limit the free move-
ment of molecular chains, and surfaces that are not water-
loving prevent microbes from sticking and forming a bioﬁlm
needed for steady enzyme work [69]. Treating the surface of
a material by UV irradiation or abrasion raises its roughness
and adds hydrophilicity, making it easier for microbes to
adhere and improving enzymatic activity [133]. It is also nec-
essary to consider that microorganisms could be challenged by
other compounds used to make aligner devices, making the
problem of degradation even more diﬃcult. Tuning both the
substrate and environment is important to improving PET
decomposition and making these technologies practical for
use at large scales.
9. Challenges and Biotechnological Approaches
Several diﬃcult problems remain in eﬃciently biodegrading
the PET in orthodontic aligners. Slow deterioration, reduced
access to enzymes by the highly ordered structure, and
harmful buildup of intermediates and complex compounds
in commercially used aligners result in the main challenges
[36, 134]. Moreover, problems with keeping microbial com-
munities and enzymes reliable at a large scale are barriers
preventing this technology from being widely used. To
address these problems, biotechnology is now using enzyme
engineering, synthetic biology, and bioprocess improvement.

evolution and computational design, the activity, heat stabil-
ity, and what they can process are now greatly improved in
enzymes like PETase and MHETase [135]. The approach
of synthetic biology makes it easier to build microbial com-
munities that use optimized pathways and cooperate, which
improves the ﬁnal results of degradation [136]. Meanwhile,
using wild-type catalysts in bioreactor designs stopsﬂuctua-
tions in these enzymes and helps preserve the community,
allowing biodegradation to happen nonstop under control.
Merged studies in microbial ecology, enzymes, materials,
and bioprocess engineering are necessary to ﬁnd eﬀective
and economical methods for breaking down orthodontic
PET waste.
10. Conclusion
The microbial group used to break down PET-based ortho-
dontic aligners points to an environmentally friendly way to
handle orthodontic waste. From myﬁndings, I learned that
boosting the eﬀectiveness of biodegradation depends on
shaping the microbial community, adjusting growth condi-
tions, and adjusting PET-type substrates. Looking at degra-
dation via gravimetric, SEM, FTIR, XRD, and
chromatographic approaches gives a clear picture of changes
in the PET due to enzymes and microbes. Still, challenges
like increased crystallinity of polymers, issues related to
water repellency on their surfaces, the buildup of inhibitory
intermediates, additives causing microbial inhibition, and
limitations on scaling up are still present, pushing the need
for fresh biotechnological approaches. Protein engineering,
synthetic biology, surface preparation strategies, and
advanced bioprocess engineering are essential to dealing
with these issues. More studies are needed to create strong
groups of microbes and designed enzymes that better break
down PET in real-life environments and factories, helping
to move toward safe and eﬃcient use of aligners.
