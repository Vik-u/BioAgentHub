Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA)-producing bacteria represent a powerful synthetic biology chassis 
for waste bioconversion and bio-upcycling where PHAs can be produced as the ﬁnal products. In 
this study, we present a seamless plasmid construction for orthogonal expression of recombinant 
PET hydrolase (PETase) in model PHA-producing bacteria P. putida and C. necator . To this end, 
this study described seamless cloning and expression methods utilizing SureVector (SV) system 
for generating pSV-Ortho-PHA (pSVOP) expression platform in bioengineered P. putida and C. 
necator . Genetic parts speciﬁcally Trc promoter, pBBR1 origin of replication, anchoring proteins 
and signal sequences were utilized for the transformation of pSVOP-based plasmid in electrocom- 
petent cells and orthogonal expression of PETase in both P. putida and C. necator . Validation steps 
in conﬁrming functional expression of PETase activity in corresponding PETase-expressing strains 
were also described to demonstrate seamless and detailed methods in establishing bioengineered 
P. putida and C. necator as whole-cell biocatalysts tailored for plastic bio-upcycling.

DNA preparation and manipulations 
High-ﬁdelity KOD FX NEO (Toyobo, Japan) was used for PCR ampliﬁcation of DNA fragments used for construction and veriﬁcation 
of the DNA fragments in recombinant vectors. All recombinant vectors were puriﬁed using FavorPrep TM Plasmid DNA Extraction Mini 
Kit (Favorgen, Taiwan). DNA fragments were puriﬁed from agarose gels using the NucleoSpin gel and PCR clean-up kit (Macherey- 
Nagel, Düren, Germany). The genomic DNA of I. sakaiensis was extracted using Wizard® Genomic DNA Puriﬁcation Kit (Promega, 
USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction manual. DNA extractions and transformations in E. coli were performed according 
to standard molecular biology procedures [1] . All oligonucleotides used in this study were listed in Table 2 .

Genetic parts assembly using SureVector system 
The SureVector system utilized a multipartite plasmid that provided seamless assembly of standard genetic parts for functional 
expression of genes in prokaryotic and eukaryotic hosts [ 2 , 3 ]. This modular cloning system provided streamlined and customizable 
DNA modules consisted of standard genetic parts for promoter (P), protein expression tag, selectable marker (SM), bacterial replication 
fragment (ORI), linkers (XP) and repressor proteins that were designed to be ﬂanked by unique 30 base pair (bp) sequences. The 
SureVector platform allowed user-deﬁned plasmid construction via the introduction of DNA sequences in the gene of interest (GOI) 
module. 
pSV-Ortho-PHA (pSVOP) plasmid design 
As a proof-of-concept for orthogonal expression, PETase (Genbank GAP38373.1) gene from I. sakaiensis was selected as the main 
genetic part for plastic biocatalysis in two diﬀerent PHA-producing bacteria speciﬁcally P. putida and C. necator . To enable plasmid 
replication and functional expression in both bacterial strains, pBBR1 origin of replication (ori) and Trc promoter (pTrc) were selected 
as parts for conferring orthogonal expression in both bacteria. To demonstrate the feasibility of extracellular production of PETase, ice 
nucleation protein (INP; P. syringae Genbank AF013159.1), carbohydrate binding domain (CBM; P. stutzeri Genbank AB012225.1) and 
signal sequence (SS; I. sakaiensis Genbank GAP38373.1) sequences were added to generate pSVOP-INP-PETase, pSVOP-INP-PETase- 
CBM and pSVOP-ss-PETase plasmids, respectively. The design and construction of pSVOP plasmid harboring the corresponding genetic 
SV parts and GOIs were illustrated in Fig. 1 .

Parts assembly for generating recombinant plasmids 
Using the SureVector Core cloning kit, all the genetic parts were introduced in the GOI module to generate the starting plasmid, 
pSV-INP + PETase + CBM ( Fig. 1 ). The genetic parts were assembled according to the gene design in the manufacturer’s instruction 
manual. All the modules were assembled as follows in a ﬁnal volume of 20 𝜇L: 2 μL of 10 ×SV reaction buﬀer, 2 μL of 1 ×SureSolution, 
1 μL of dNTP Mix, 1 μL of SV Enzyme, 2 μL of each module consisting SM kanamycin, ORI pUC, XP-1 XP1 Linker, XP-2 Lacl and P 
T7-His6, 0.05 p/mol μL of GOI fragments consisting DNA fragments of promoter pTrc, INP, PETase, CBM and pBBR1. Thermocycling 
of these components consisted of 1 cycle of 95 °C for 1 min, followed by 8 cycles at 95 °C for 20 s, 55 °C for 90 s and 68 °C for 
1 min; 1 cycle at 68 °C for 1 min, and 1 cycle at 4 °C for 2 min. Following thermocycling, one unit of DpnI restriction enzyme was 
added to the reaction and incubated for 5 min at 37°C followed by transfer on ice. One 𝜇L of the reaction was transformed into E. 
coli XL1-Blue Supercompetent cells according to manufacturer’s instructions. The transformation mixtures were spread onto LB agar 
plates containing the appropriate antibiotic and incubated at 37°C until colonies were easily visualized (12–16 h). The assembled pSV- 
INP + PETase + CBM plasmid was validated via Sanger sequencing (Apical Scientiﬁc, Selangor, Malaysia). To generate pSVOP plasmids, 
broad-host-range pBBR1 ori from pBBR1MCS-3 plasmid (Nova Lifetech Inc., Hong Kong, China) was used and introduced to generate 
corresponding plasmids, pSVOP, pSVOP-INP-PETase-CBM, pSVOP-INP-PETase and pSVOP-ssPETase ( Fig. 2 ). The respective plasmids 
were assembled in the shown numbering order via isothermal-based Gibson assembly using methods described previously by Ramzi, 
A.B., et al. (2018) [4] . 
Transformation of recombinant PETase expression vectors systems in PHB-producing bacteria by electroporation 
Preparation of electrocompetent cells and electroporation of P. putida 
The preparation of P. putida electrocompetent cells and electroporation methods were adapted from Martínez-García, E. and 
deLorenzo,V. (2012) [5] . A graphical overview of the protocols for preparing and transforming the recombinant plasmids into elec- 
trocompetent P. putida was shown in Fig 3 . A single colony from a freshly streaked plate of P. putida was inoculated in 20 mL LB 
medium as starter culture and grown overnight ( ∼16 h) at 30 °C with shaking (200 RPM). The culture was immediately placed on 
ice and cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5, 000 × g at room temperature for 10 min. The cells were washed twice with 
sterile ice-cold 300 mM sucrose with centrifugation at low temperatures. Next, the harvested cells were gently resuspended in 1 mL 
of ice-cold 300 mM sucrose followed by transferred into sterile 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes. The cell culture tubes were centrifuged at 
8, 000 × g for 2 min. The supernatants were discarded. About 500 μL of ice-cold Buﬀer B (300 mM sucrose + 10 % (v/v) glycerol) 
was added to the cells and gently resuspended. The resuspended cells were distributed in 100 μL aliquots in sterile 1.5 mL Eppendorf 
tubes and stored at − 80 °C ( Fig. 3 A). For electroporation ( Fig. 3 B), freshly prepared recombinant plasmids (Concentration range: 100 
to 200 ng/μL; volume 2–10 μL) were added to 100 μL aliquot of P. putida competent cells and mixed gently. The samples were placed 
in a prechilled sterile 2-mm gap width electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad, USA). The cuvettes were kept on ice for 10 min and then 
placed in the electroporation apparatus (Eppendorf Eporator®, Eppendorf AG, Germany) where the electrical settings voltage was 
set at 2500 V. Immediately after pulse discharge, 900 μL of pre-warmed LB medium was added directly to the cuvettes. The samples 
were transferred to 15-mL sterile test tubes and incubated at 30 °C overnight ( ∼16 h) with shaking (180 RPM). The cells were plated 
onto pre-warmed M9-citrate agar containing 100 μg/mL kanamycin. All plates were incubated for 2 days at 30 °C.

Preparation of electrocompetent cells and electroporation of C. necator 
The preparation of electrocompetent cells of C. necator and subsequent electroporation methods were modiﬁed from Tee, K. L., 
et al., (2017) [6] . A schematic overview of the protocols for preparing and transforming the recombinant plasmids into electrocom- 
petent C. necator was illustrated in Fig. 4 . As shown in Fig. 4 A, a single colony of C. necator was cultured in fresh LB medium broth 
and incubated overnight at 30 °C with shaking (200 RPM). Preferably, the bacteria were grown until OD 600 values reached 0.4 to 
0.6. Following cultivation, the bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 10,000 RPM for 15 min. The separated cells were 
resuspended in 50 mM CaCl 2 and incubated on ice for 15 min. Cells were harvested following centrifugation for 10 min at 4 °C. 
Following this, the bacterial cells were then washed twice with ice-cold 0.2 M sucrose and centrifuged at 7000 RPM for 2 min 4 °C. 
All supernatants were removed completely. The washed cells were then resuspended in Buﬀer B (300 mM sucrose + 10 % (v/v)

glycerol) and aliquoted into sterile 1.5 mL tubes (100 μL each). For electroporation steps ( Fig. 4 B), the competent cells of C. necator 
were mixed with freshly prepared recombinant plasmids (Concentration range: 100 to 200 ng/μL; volume 2–10 μL) in prechilled 
sterile 2-mm gap width electroporation cuvette (Bio-Rad, USA). The cuvettes were kept on ice for 10 min and then placed in the 
electroporation apparatus (Eppendorf Eporator®, Eppendorf AG, Germany) where the electrical settings voltage was set at 2300 V. 
Following pulse discharge, prewarmed LB broth was immediately added to the tube to make a total of 1 mL mixture to recover the 
cells. The bacterial cultures were then incubated at 30 °C 200 RPM overnight ( ∼ 18 h). The cultures were subsequently plated on 
LB + Kanamycin (100 μg/mL) plates. Plates were incubated for 2 days at 30 °C until colonies were formed. 
Method validation 
Colony PCR of PETase gene in PETase-expressing P. putida and C. necator 
To conﬁrm the presence of recombinant plasmids in the transformants of P. putida and C. necator , colony PCR of recombinant 
PETase gene (789 bp) was performed by selecting random colonies on the plates of the corresponding recombinant strains. Each 25 
μL of PCR mixture contained 4.5 μL autoclave distilled water, 12.5 μL 2 × PCR buﬀer, 5 μL 2 mM DNTPs, 0.75 μL of 10 pmol of 
primer pairs of Fwd PET and Rev PET, 2 μL of template genomic DNA/transformant cells (Grown in LB + Kanamycin broth) and 0.5 
μL of Toyobo KOD FX Neo (1 U/L). Thermocycling condition was set at; 1 cycle of pre-denaturation 94 °C for 2 min, 30 cycles of 
denaturation 98 °C for 10 s, annealing 71 °C for 30 s, extension 68 °C for 30 s. 1 cycle of ﬁnal extension 68 °C and 4 °C. As shown in 
Fig. 5 , single bands of PETase gene were obtained in all PETase-containing plasmid constructs hence conﬁrming the high eﬃciency 
and successful introduction of the gene and respective plasmids in both bacterial hosts. 
Recombinant production of PETase protein in PHB-producing bacteria 
Enzyme production was started by inoculation of an overnight culture of recombinant P. putida and C. necator harboring PETase 
expression vectors in LB plus kanamycin medium. The bacterial cultures were then induced using 0.01 M IPTG when the cell density 
reached approximately OD 600 = 0.4. The induced culture was harvested after 24 h-post induction and centrifuged 5000 × g , 20 min 
at 4 °C. To demonstrate the functional activity of recombinant PETase in corresponding pSVOP plasmids, enzymatic assays were 
performed using para-nitrophenyl butyrate (PNPB) as the model esterase substrate using methods adapted from Heyde, S. H. A., 
et al., (2021) [7] . The esterase activity of the expressed PETase was measured spectrophotometrically in ﬂat bottom polystyrene 
96-well microtiter plates by measuring the absorbance reading at 405 nm using microplate absorbance reader (iMark TM , Bio-Rad, 
USA). For this purpose, a 10 mM stock solution of PNPB was prepared by dissolving 13.9 mg of PNPB powder (Sigma Aldrich, USA) 
in 10 mL of acetonitrile. The assay mixture was composed of 100 μL of substrate-buﬀer solution (Tris–HCl pH 7.4 containing 2 mM of 
PNPB). The reaction was started by adding 50 μL of the bacterial supernatant with ﬁnal OD 600 = 0.1 (Diluted with LB broth) followed 
by incubation at 37 °C for 10 min. Activity measurements were performed in triplicate ( Fig. 6 ).
