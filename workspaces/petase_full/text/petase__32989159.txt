Plastics pollution represents a global environmental crisis. In re-
sponse, microbes are evolving the capacity to utilize synthetic
polymers as carbon and energy sources. Recently,Ideonella sakaien-
sis w a sr e p o r t e dt os e c r e t eat w o - enzyme system to deconstruct
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) to its constituent monomers. Spe-
cifically, theI. sakaiensisPETase depolymerizes PET, liberating soluble
products, including mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET),
which is cleaved to terephthalic acid and ethylene glycol by
MHETase. Here, we report a 1.6 Å resolution MHETase structure,
illustrating that the MHETase core domain is similar to PETase, cap-
ped by a lid domain. Simulations of the catalytic itinerary predict
that MHETase follows the canonical two-step serine hydrolase
mechanism. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that MHETase evolved
from ferulic acid esterases, and two homologous enzymes are shown
to exhibit MHET turnover. Analysis of the two homologous enzymes
and the MHETase S131G mutant demonstrates the importance of
this residue for accommodation of MHET in the active site. We also
demonstrate that the MHETase lid is crucial for hydrolysis of MHET
and, furthermore, that MHETase does not turnover mono(2-hydroxyethyl)-
furanoate or mono(2-hydroxyethyl)-isophthalate. A highly synergistic
relationship between PETase and MHETase was observed for the
conversion of amorphous PET film to monomers across all nonzero
MHETase concentrations tested. Finally, we compare the perfor-
mance of MHETase:PETase chimeric proteins of varying linker
lengths, which all exhibit improved PET and MHET turnover rel-
ative to the free enzymes. Together, these results offer insights
into the two-enzyme PET depolymerization system and will inform
future efforts in the biological deconstruction and upcycling of
mixed plastics.

ynthetic polymers pervade all aspects of modern life, due to
their low cost, high durability, and impressive range of tun-
ability. Originally developed to avoid the use of animal-based
products, plastics have now become so widespread that their
leakage into the biosphere and accumulation in landfills is cre-
ating a global-scale environmental crisis. Indeed, plastics have
been found widespread in the world’s oceans (1–4), in the soil (5),
and more recently, microplastics have been observed entrained in
the air (6). The leakage of plastics into the environment on a
planetary scale has led to the subsequent discovery of multiple
biological systems able to convert man-made polymers for use as a
carbon and energy source (7–12). These plastic-degrading systems
offer a starting point for biotechnology applications toward a
circular materials economy (12–16).
Among synthetic polymers manufactured today, polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) is the most abundant polyester, which is made
from petroleum-derived terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene
glycol (EG). Given the prevalence of esterase enzymes in nature,
PET biodegradation has been studied for nearly two decades, with
multiple cutinase enzymes reported to perform depolymerization
(17–26). In 2016, Yoshida et al. (10) reported the discovery and
characterization of the soil bacterium,Ideonella sakaiensis201-F6,
which employs a two-enzyme system to depolymerize PET to TPA
and EG, which are further catabolized as a carbon and energy
source. Characterization ofI. sakaiensisrevealed the PETase en-
zyme, which is a cutinase-like serine hydrolase that attacks the
PET polymer, liberating bis-(hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET),
mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET), and TPA. PETase
cleaves BHET to MHET and EG, and the soluble MHET product
is further hydrolyzed by MHETase to produce TPA and EG.
Multiple crystal structures and biochemical studies ofI. sakaiensis
PETase (27–33) revealed an open active-site architecture that is
able to bind to PET oligomers. The PETase enzyme likely follows
the canonical serine hydrolase catalytic mechanism (34), but open
Significance
Deconstruction of recalcitrant polymers, such as cellulose or
chitin, is accomplished in nature by synergistic enzyme cocktails
that evolved over millions of years. In these systems, soluble
dimeric or oligomeric intermediates are typically released via
interfacial biocatalysis, and additional enzymes often process
the soluble intermediates into monomers for microbial uptake.
The recent discovery of a two-enzyme system for polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) deconstruction, which employs one enzyme
to convert the polymer into soluble intermediates and another
enzyme to produce the constituent PET monomers (MHETase),
suggests that nature may be evolving similar deconstruction
strategies for synthetic plastics. This study on the characteriza-
tion of the MHETase enzyme and synergy of the two-enzyme
PET depolymerization system may inform enzyme cocktail-based
strategies for plastics upcycling.

questions remain regarding the mobility of certain residues during
the catalytic cycle (27).
Conversely, the structure and function of the MHETase en-
zyme is far less characterized, with only two published studies
focused on MHETase structure and engineering to date (35, 36).
These studies report structures at 2.1 to 2.2 Å resolution,
wherein the similarity to ferulic acid esterase (FAE) is noted (37,
38). Informed by these structures, engineering efforts aimed to
improve turnover of BHET by MHETase, which is a nonnative
substrate of the wild-type. Beyond these studies and the original
report of MHETase from Yoshida et al. (10), several questions
remain regarding the MHETase mechanism and PETase-MHETase
synergy. To that end, here we combine structural, computational,
biochemical, and bioinformatics approaches to reveal molecular
insights into the MHETase structure, mechanism of hydrolysis, the
evolution of MHETase activity from FAEs, and engineering of the
two-enzyme system for PET depolymerization.
Results
Structural Characterization of MHETase Reveals a Core Domain Similar
to That of PETase. Four crystal structures of MHETase were
obtained with the highest-resolution data (6QZ3) extending to
1.6 Å with a benzoate molecule in the active site (Fig. 1 andSI
Appendix,T a b l eS 1). These data reveal a catalytic domain that
adopts theα/β-hydrolase fold typical of a serine hydrolase (Fig. 1A,
light gray), with an extensive lid domain (Fig. 1A,d a r kg r a y )t h a t
partially covers the active site and hosts a well-coordinated Ca

cation. A similar Ca2+ binding site was characterized forAspergillus

role in stabilizing the lid domain (38). Overall, the structure of

the lid domain, residues Ser225, Asp492, and His528 effectively
reconstitute the catalytic triad (Fig. 1B). In fact, the terminal res-
idues of the lid domain converge to within hydrogen-bonding
distance of each other (Tyr252-Ala469, 2.9 Å), creating a com-
pact linkage to the hydrolase domain. The lid domain of MHETase
is exceptionally large, as average lid domains inα/β-hydrolases tend
to be∼100 residues (34), and is more typical of a lid from tannase
family members (vide infra). The equivalent connection site in
PETase is occupied by a seven-residue loop.
In addition, we determined two apo structures with alternative
packing (6QZ2 and 6QZ4), one structure with a fully occupied
benzoic acid ligand (6QZ3), and one with partially occupied
benzoic acid (6QZ1). We observed that residue Phe415 adopts a
“closed” orientation on substrate binding consistent with prior
substrate bound structures (PDB ID codes 6QGA and 6QGB)
(35), and the partially occupied site results in an intermediate
dual “open/closed” conformation (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 A–C)
(35). The only other amino acid with side-chain positioning
correlated with ligand binding is Gln410. When Phe415 is in the
open position, the side chain of Gln410 pivots toward the active
site to a position wherein the heavy atoms would be as close as
1.8 Å to those of Phe415 if it were in the closed conformation
(SI Appendix,F i g .S 2D).
Given the difference in overall isoelectric point (pI) between
PETase (9.65) and MHETase (5.11), we generated electrostatic
surface profiles for comparison (Fig. 1E). As previously reported,
PETase has a highly polarized surface charge (29), whereas
MHETase exhibits a more heterogeneous and acidic surface charge
distribution. MHETase contains five disulfide bonds (Fig. 1A). One
of the MHETase disulfides is located at the active site, connecting
cysteines (Cys224 and Cys529) adjacent to the catalytic residues
(Ser225 and His528, respectively), which is conserved in tannase
family members (38). PETase lacks a structurally equivalent disul-
fide, and the aligning residues in PETase (Trp159 and Ser238)
are the same two residues mutated by Austin et al. (29) to yield a
PETase substrate binding groove similar to that of cutinases,
resulting in improved activity on a crystalline PET substrate.

in silico utilizing the CHARMM (39) molecular simulation
package (details in SI Appendix, Supplementary Materials and
Methods). To examine MHETase dynamics and ligand stability,
classic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were conducted with
NAMD (40) (all simula tions totaling 2.25 μs) utilizing the
CHARMM forcefield (41). Given the observed dual occupancy
for Phe415 positioning in the crystal structures, we simulated in
triplicate (each simulation 150 ns in length) the four combinations
of Phe415 position (open and closed) and active site occupancy
(empty active site and MHET-bound). In each case wherein
Phe415 begins in the closed state (starting configurations from
6QZ3 structure, with coordinates for residues 56 to 61 from
6QZ4), Phe415 opens in the first 10 ns and rarely returns to the
closed state; simulations that begin with Phe415 open (built from
6QZ4 structure) all remain open. To examine the effect of calcium
binding, a fifth scenario absent of either MHET or Ca
2+ was
modeled in triplicate 150-ns simulations (the prior four scenarios
each include bound Ca2+). These trajectories show evidence for
lid stabilization upon Ca2+ binding mainly in the immediate vi-
cinity of the calcium binding site (SI Appendix, Fig. S3). When
bound at the active site, the carboxylate motif of MHET exhibits
stable hydrogen bonds with Arg411 and Ser416, while the carbonyl
is stabilized via hydrogen bonds to the oxyanion hole residues,
Glu226 and Gly132 (SI Appendix, Figs. S4 and S5). In all three
simulations with MHET bound and Phe415 open, MHET main-
tains these interactions and remains bound at the active site
throughout the duration of the 150-ns simulation and primed for
hydrolysis (hydrogen bond distance between Ser225 and His528=
2.0 ± 0.2 Å; nucleophilic attack distance between Ser225 and
MHET = 3.1 ± 0.3 Å; hydrogen bond distance between Asp492
and His528= 1.8 ± 0.1 Å). Further analysis of the MD simula-
tions, including time traces for these important interactions, is
available in theSI Appendix, Supplementary Materials and Methods.

BIOCHEMISTRY
Serine hydrolases catalyze a two-step reaction involving for-
mation of an acyl-enzyme intermediate (acylation) that is re-
leased hydrolytically in the second step (deacylation) (34). We
utilized the Amber software package (42) to perform hybrid
quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) 2D um-
brella sampling with semiempirical force field SCC-DFTB (43)
to study the catalytic steps. Judicious selection of a reaction co-
ordinate is critical for kinetically meaningful barrier calculations.
We chose the forming and breaking C-O bonds to map the free-
energy landscape for both reaction steps, informed by transition
path sampling studies of other hydrolase enzymes (44, 45).
In acylation, the catalytic serine (Ser225) is deprotonated by
His528, activating it for nucleophilic attack upon the carbonyl C
of MHET, liberating EG and forming the acyl-enzyme inter-
mediate (AEI) (Fig. 2A–C and Movie S1). The minimum free-
energy path (MFEP) computed from QM/MM 2D umbrella
sampling (along the forming C-O bond between the MHET
carbonyl C and Ser225 and the breaking MHET C-O ester bond)
predicts an acylation free-energy barrier (ΔG
‡) of 13.9± 0.17
kcal/mol with an overall reaction free energy (ΔGreaction)o f−5.2 ±
0.04 kcal/mol (Fig. 2G and SI Appendix,F i g .S 6A). Although serine
hydrolases have at times been considered to proceed through
metastable tetrahedral intermediates along the reaction pathway
for acylation and deacylation (46–48), the acylation MFEP cal-
culated from 2D umbrella sampling does not indicate interme-
diate configurations with metastability.
Following cleavage of EG from MHET, classic MD simulation
reveals that EG leaves the active site in the presence of the AEI
(Fig. 2H and Movie S2). In one simulation, EG initially main-
tains a hydrogen bond with His528 for∼100 ps, then dislodges
from the active site, and is free in solution within 1 ns. Three
identical simulations were initiated, and EG exits the active site
within 4 ns in each. An important implication of this observation
is that the deacylation reaction proceeds without EG in the active
site. This allows greater access for water molecules to approach the
charged nitrogen of His528 for deacylation (SI Appendix,F i g .S 7).
Deacylation involves nucleophilic attack by a water molecule
on the AEI, liberating TPA (Fig. 2D–F and Movie S3). His528
plays a similar role as in acylation, deprotonating the catalytic water
and transferring this proton to the catalytic serine, regenerating
Ser225 for another catalytic cycle. The MFEP computed from QM/
MM 2D umbrella sampling (along the forming C-O bond between
MHET and water and the breaking AEI C-O bond) reveals a
deacylation free-energy barrier (ΔG
‡)o f1 9 . 8± 0.10 kcal/mol and
an overall reaction free energy (ΔGreaction)o f2 . 6± 0.07 kcal/mol
(Fig. 2I and SI Appendix,F i g .S 6B). Together, the two catalytic steps
are exergonic by−2.6 ± 0.08 kcal/mol. Deacylation is predicted to
be the rate-limiting step, with a rate of 7.1± 1.1 × 10−2 s−1 (from
transition state theory, at 30 °C, and assuming a transmission co-
efficient of 1), more than four orders-of-magnitude slower than
acylation (1.02± 0.28 × 10
3 s−1). As in acylation, metastable con-
figurations along the MFEP are not observed.
Bioinformatics Analysis Suggests That MHETase Evolved from an FAE.
Beyond structural and mechanistic investigations, we were also
interested in understanding potential MHETase evolutionary
ancestry and identifying other MHET-active enzymes from nat-
ural diversity. MHETase belongs to the tannase family (PFAM
ID: PF07519), which consists of fungal and bacterial FAEs,
fungal and bacterial tannases, and several bacterial homologs of
unknown function (49). To elucidate sequence relationships
between MHETase and tannase family enzymes, we performed
bioinformatic analyses of 6,671 tannase family sequences re-
trieved from the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) via PSI-BLAST (50). MHETase shares low sequence
similarity (<53%) with most sequences in the family, with the
exception of homologs from Comamonas thiooxydans strains
DS1, DF1, and DF2 (strain: NCBI:txid363952, protein:GenBank
WP_080747404.1) (51) andHydrogenophaga sp. PML113 (strain:
NCBI:txid1899350, protein:GenBank WP_083293388.1), which
exhibit 81% and 73% identity toMHETase, respectively (Fig. 3A).
Since initial identification of the homologousC. thiooxydanssequence
(WP_080747404.1), this entry was removed from GenBank, as dis-
cussed inSI Appendix, Supplementary Materials and Methods.
Using the multiple sequence alignment of 6,671 tannase family
sequences, we performed conservation analysis with MHETase
sequence positions as a reference (SI Appendix, Figs. S8 and S9),
which shows that most positions in the active site are highly
conserved. Notable exceptions are positions 257, 411, 415, and
416, which exhibit low conservation scores and are less conserved
than 80% of MHETase positions overall (SI Appendix, Fig. S8B
and C). It is noteworthy (vide infra) that position 131 is a well-
conserved glycine in 91% of tannase family sequences but serine
appears at position 131 in MHETase (Fig. 3B). Furthermore, the
10 cysteine positions in MHETase that form 5 disulfide bonds
are highly conserved in the tannase family (SI Appendix,F i g .
S10A). Although a sixth disulfide bond exists inAoFaeB (38),
less than 8% of tannase family sequences exhibit this sixth disulfide
bond, and the sixth disulfide bond positions are variable among this
set (SI Appendix,F i g .S 1 0B). One cysteine of the sixth disulfide
bond inAoFaeB is a single residue variation found in MHETase
(38), whereas the other sits on a loop where a 15-residue deletion is
found in MHETase.
With this large dataset, we further conducted phylogenetic
analysis of 120 sequences selected from tannase family sequences
that were clearly annotated as tannases or FAEs in GenBank,
including MHETase (SI Appendix, Table S2). In the phylogenetic
tree (SI Appendix, Fig. S11), bacterial and fungal enzymes form
paraphyletic groups, and within these groups, there are separate
FAE and tannase subgroups. MHETase and theC. thiooxydans
and Hydrogenophaga sp. PML113 homologs are found within a
group of proteobacterial FAEs (bootstrap value> 95%). In ad-
dition, when separate profile hidden Markov models (pHMM) are
constructed with the annotated tannase family FAE and tannase
sequences (52), and then aligned with MHETase, a higher align-
ment score is achieved with the FAE pHMM than with the tan-
nase pHMM (456.8 vs. 396.8), suggesting that MHETase is more
similar to FAEs than tannases.
Biochemical Characterization of Active-Site MHETase Mutants and
Homologs Reveals Important Residues for MHET Hydrolytic Activity.
From the bioinformatics analyses, we selected the MHETase
homologs fromC. thiooxydansand Hydrogenophaga sp. PML113
(Fig. 3A) to test for MHET hydrolysis activity, which, along with
the I. sakaiensis MHETase, were produced inEscherichia coli
and purified. Activity assays were performed for each enzyme to
determine MHET turnover rates (Fig. 3E). The turnover rate
(k
cat) for MHETase is 27.6± 2.6 s−1, as compared to 9.5± 0.8 s−1
and 3.8± 2.5 s−1 for theC. thiooxydansand Hydrogenophaga sp.
PML113 enzymes, respectively. The enzymes were also evalu-
ated over a range of substrate concentrations to determine the
Michaelis–Menten kinetic parameters (Fig. 3 G–J and SI Ap-
pendix,T a b l eS 3). FAEs have been shown to exhibit concentration-
dependent substrate inhibition (53) in addition to the likely product
inhibition of the enzyme (35). MHETase and both homologs also
display this behavior. Using a substrate inhibition model (details in
SI Appendix, Supplementary Materials and Methods), evaluation of
the substrate-dependent reaction kinetics shows that MHETase
more efficiently accepts MHET as a substrate than theC. thioox-
ydans and Hydrogenophagasp. PML113 homologs, demonstrated by
a K
m value of 23.17± 1.65 μMa sc o m p a r e dt ov a l u e so f1 7 4 . 7 0±
4.75 μMa n d4 1 . 0 9± 3.38 μM, respectively (Fig. 3G–I and SI
Appendix,T a b l eS 3). However, MHETase is also the most suscep-
tible to substrate inhibition with aKk value of 307.30± 20.65 μM.
Despite the difference in affinity for MHET, MHETase and the
C. thiooxydansenzyme exhibit similar maximal reaction rates, while
25480 | www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.2006753117 Knott et al.
t h ee n z y m ef r o mHydrogenophaga sp. PML113 is slower. The
MHETase reaction efficiency, reported askcat/Km,i s∼10-fold higher
than for theC. thiooxydansenzyme and∼20-fold higher than the
Hydrogenophagasp. PML113 enzyme.
Homology models of both theC. thiooxydansand Hydrogenophaga
sp. PML113 enzymes were constructed with SWISS-MODEL (54)
using the MHETase structure as a template (PDB ID code
6QZ3), and the active site aligned with a modeled MHET-bound
MHETase structure (Fig. 3D). As noted, position 131 is a serine in
MHETase, but a glycine in the two homologs (C. thiooxydans,
Gly179 andHydrogenophgasp. PML113, Gly121) (Fig. 3B). TheC.
thiooxydansenzyme is otherwise identical within 6 Å of the docked
MHET ligand, whereas theHydrogenophaga sp. PML113 enzyme
also exhibits a serine in the equivalent position to the MHETase
residue Phe415 (Fig. 3C). An S131G mutant of MHETase was
constructed to examine the role of this residue in MHET hydro-
lytic activity, and steady-state enzyme kinetics were evaluated. The
MHETase S131G mutant does not demonstrate concentration-
dependent substrate inhibition, as is observed for the wild-type
enzyme, which is likely due to the poor affinity for MHET. The
S131G mutant has aK
m value approximately eightfold higher than
that of wild-type MHETase and the reaction efficiency is reduced
to ∼3% that of the wild-type (Fig. 3J and SI Appendix, Table S3),
illustrating the importance of this residue in MHET turnover.
Focusing on residues within the coordination sphere of the
docked MHET ligand, amino acids and their frequencies across
the tannase family were compared to MHETase (SI Appendix,
Figs. S8 and S9). In position 495, MHETase features a phenyl-
alanine, while isoleucine is also a common residue in this posi-
tion across the tannase family. Palm et al. (35) demonstrated that
Phe495 has a modest effect on activity by mutation to alanine.
We constructed and evaluated an MHETase mutant with iso-
leucine in this position (F495I), which dramatically impairs ac-
tivity, lowering the turnover rate from 27.6± 2.6 s
−1 to 1.3 ±
0.7 s−1 (Fig. 3E). In position 226, which is part of the conserved
“lipase box” motif in serine hydrolases (55), MHETase exhibits a
glutamate, while threonine and asparagine are more common
among tannase family members. Mutation of this lipase box residue
to threonine (E226T) yielded a∼50% reduction in MHET activity
relative to the wild-type MHETase (Fig. 3E). Mutation of the cat-
alytic serine (S225A), as expected, produced an inactive enzyme.
Unique Structural Features between MHETase and PETase Determine
Substrate Specificity and Stability.Given the structural similarities
of the MHETase and PETase core domains (Fig. 1C and D), we
were interested in understanding the role of unique MHETase
features, namely the lid domain and the active site disulfide bond
between Cys224 and Cys529, on substrate specificity and MHET
hydrolytic activity. Accordingly, the lid was both added to PETase
(“lidded PETase ”) and removed from MHETase ( “lidless
MHETase”). Given the natural substrate specificities of wild-type
PETase and MHETase, we hypothesized that the former could
confer MHET activity, but abolish PET hydrolytic potential,
whereas the latter was expected to have the opposite effect. The
lidded PETase was created by replacing the seven-residue loop of
PETase (Trp185:Phe191, PETase numbering) with Gly251:Thr472
from MHETase. In control experiments, wild-type PETase
exhibited no detectable activity on MHET, and the lidded PETase
is not able to degrade amorphous PET film. However, meager
activity of lidded PETase was detected on MHET (k
cat = 0.11 ±
0.02 s−1) (Fig. 3F). The lidless MHETase was created by replacing
the MHETase lid (Gly251:Thr472) with the seven-residue loop of
PETase (Trp185:Phe191, PETase numbering). This construction
results in an exposed MHETase active site, possibly allowing for
acquired PET hydrolytic activity. The resulting enzyme has ak
cat
value on MHET of 0.05± 0.03 s−1, 1,000-fold lower than the rate
for wild-type MHETase, demonstrating that the lid domain is cru-
cial for MHET hydrolytic activity (Fig. 3F). The lidless MHETase
enzyme was also unable to degrade amorphous PET film over 96 h,
despite the more accessible active site.
Similarly, variants of lidless MHETase were generated to
remove the active site disulfide and replace the two sites with
tryptophan and serine (lidless MHETase C224W/C529S) (SI
Appendix, Fig. S1B) to reconstitute the PETase active site, or
with histidine and phenylalanine (lidless MHETase C224H/
C529F), matching the active site of the double-mutant PETase
variant previously shown to exhibit improved PET hydrolytic
activity on crystalline PET (29). The lidless MHETase C224W/
C529S mutant, which reconstitutes the wild-type active site motif
of PETase, displays the same turnover rate (within error) as the
lidded PETase mutant on MHET (k
cat = 0.10 ± 0.06 s−1), while
the lidless MHETase C224H/C529F mutant is even less active on
MHET (k
cat = 0.06 ± 0.03 s−1) (Fig. 3F). We also generated a
PETase variant to recreate the active site disulfide found in
MHETase (PETase W159C/S238C). The PETase mutant exhibi-
ted very low MHET hydrolytic activity (k
cat = 0.03 ± 0.3 s−1), and
similarly had no activity on BHET or amorphous PET film.
To delineate the effects of engineering the lid and removing
the active site disulfide bond, we also generated three MHETase
mutants altering only the active site disulfide motif (C224A/
C529A, C224W/C529S, and C224H/C529F). We hypothesized
that removal of this disulfide bond may diminish the thermal
stability of MHETase. However, each of these variants either
expressed in inclusion bodies or did not express at all. Attempts
were also made to introduce disulfide motifs into MHETase that
are found in PETase (G489C/S530C) or inAoFaeB. To reca-
pitulate theAoFaeB disulfide, the mutations include both a point
mutation (S136C) as well as the insertion of a 15-residue loop
from AoFaeB that harbors the partnering cysteine residue. As
with the active site disulfide mutants, these mutants either
expressed in inclusion bodies or did not express at all. A variant
was also created that included both the PETase-like disulfide
(G489C/S530C) and the AoFaeB modification (S136C with
15-residue loop fromAoFaeB). This last variant, with seven total
disulfides, was successfully expressed and had very low activity on
MHET (k
cat = 0.16 ± 0.14 s−1) (Fig. 3F). A full list of clones,
mutants, and primers can be found inDataset S1.
MHETase Is Catalytically Inactive on MHE-Isophthalate and MHE-Furanoate.
We evaluated the substrate specificity of MHETase using the
monohydroxyethyl monomer unit of two additional compounds.
Specifically, assays were performed with mono(2-hydroxyethyl)-
isophthalate (MHEI) (SI Appendix,F i g .S 1 2) and mono(2-hydroxyethyl)-
furanoate (MHEF) (SI Appendix,F i g .S 1 3). Isophthalate is a
common comonomer in industrial PET formulations used to
modify crystallinity, such that MHEI could be released from
polyester depolymerization. PETase has been demonstrated to
deconstruct other aromatic polyesters (29), including polyethylene
furanoate (PEF), yielding MHEF as a product of the enzymatic
hydrolysis reaction. Over the course of 24 h at 30 °C, no MHETase
activity was detected for either substrate using substrate concen-
trations from 25 to 250μM, in contrast with complete hydrolysis
of MHET (SI Appendix,F i g .S 1 4) in the same time using identical
reaction conditions.
To explain the inability of MHETase to act on MHEI and
MHEF, we conducted flexible ligand/flexible receptor docking
simulations and predicted 10 binding orientations for each mole-
cule (MHET, MHEI, and MHEF) in MHETase. These docking
simulations indicate that MHET binds to MHETase with a binding
free energy of−7.13 kcal/mol and in a catalytically primed con-
figuration. This binding mode features the carbonyl C of MHET
within 3.2 Å of Ser225-O, which itself is within 2.90 Å of His528-N(e)
and His528-N(d) is 3.93 Å from Asp492-O (SI Appendix, Fig.
S15). For MHEI and MHEF, no binding modes were predicted
that exhibit similarly favorable binding free energies, feature the
MHET carbonyl C within range for attack by Ser225, and stabilize

the carbonyl of the ester in the oxyanion hole, suggesting that
MHETase will not readily act on these molecules.
PETase and MHETase Act Synergistically during PET Depolymerization.
While MHET is susceptible to hydrolysis by a number of PET-
degrading cutinases, I. sakaiensis requires the action of two en-
zymes for PET degradation to liberate TPA and EG (10). Given
the turnover rates for MHETase reported here, depolymeriza-
tion by PETase is likely the rate-limiting step when the enzymes
are employed together. To investigate the action of the two-
enzyme system, we thus measured the extent of hydrolysis of a
commercial amorphous PET substrate over 96 h at 30 °C using
PETase and MHETase at varying concentrations (Fig. 4A and SI
Appendix, Table S4). As expected, MHETase alone has no ac-
tivity on PET film. Over the range of enzyme loadings tested (0
to 2.0 mg enzyme/g PET), degradation by PETase alone, as
determined by concentration of product released (the sum of
BHET, MHET, and TPA), scales with enzyme loading. Upon
addition of MHETase in the reaction, at any loading tested (0.1
to 1.0 mg MHETase/g PET), product release still scales with
PETase loading, but at a markedly higher level than with PETase
alone (Fig. 4A). The overall trend of degradation within the
range of enzyme loadings tested, which shows increasing levels of
constituent monomers released as concentration of both en-
zymes increases, is indicative that these reactions are enzyme-
limited under these conditions, rather than substrate-limited.
The synergy study does not strongly indicate that any particular
ratio of PETase to MHETase results in optimal degradation over
the enzyme loadings tested, but rather that degradation scales
with PETase loading and the presence of MHETase, even at low
concentrations relative to PETase, improves total degradation.
Chimeric Proteins of MHETase and PETase Improves PET Degradation
and MHET Hydrolysis Rates.In light of the highly synergistic rela-
tionship between PETase and MHETase on amorphous PET,
where increasing loading of each enzyme results in more con-
stituent monomer release, we next examined how proximity of
the two enzymes influences hydrolytic activity. Chimeric proteins
covalently linking the C terminus of MHETase to the N terminus
of PETase, using flexible glycine-serine linkers of 8, 12, and 20
total glycine and serine residues, were generated and assayed for
degradation of amorphous PET (Fig. 4B). Varying linker lengths
were explored to understand the effect of increased mobility
between the two domains (56). Furthermore, two enzyme loadings
were compared: The lower loading corresponding to∼0.08 mg
PETase/g PET and 0.16 mg MHETase/g PET and the higher en-
zyme loading corresponding to 0.25 mg PETase/g PET and 0.5 mg
MHETase/g PET (Fig. 4C and D). At both loadings, when com-
paring the extent of degradation achieved by PETase alone,
MHETase alone, and an equimolar mix of PETase and MHETase,
the chimeric proteins outperform PETase, as well as the mixed
reaction containing both PETase and MHETase unlinked in so-
lution. Furthermore, the chimeras demonstrate a higher catalytic
activity on MHET (Fig. 4E). Chimeric constructs linking the C
terminus of PETase to the N terminus of MHETase did not suc-
cessfully express protein (Fig. 4B). SEM analysis of digested
amorphous PET film confirms degradation (SI Appendix,F i g .S 1 6).
Discussion
The ability to degrade polymers to their monomeric units is im-
portant for subsequent reuse in new products, which is a critical
technical advance needed to enable a global circular materials
economy. In biological systems, complete depolymerization to
monomers can be necessary for microbial uptake and growth, as
in I. sakaiensis wherein MHETase is the enzymatic partner to
PETase, together allowing for the complete degradation of PET
to TPA and EG for catabolism (10). Prior studies presenting
MHETase crystal structures focused upon understanding and
tuning substrate specificity, particularly the rational engineering
of MHETase to impart BHET hydrolysis activity (35, 36). Drawing
inspiration from our structural analyses, this complementary study
offers further insights into the two-enzyme PETase/MHETase
system.
The recent structural report from Palm et al. (35) highlighted
several important amino acid contributions to substrate speci-
ficity in MHETase, specifically focusing on active site residues.
Of note, they pointed out the importance of Phe415 for substrate
binding via an“induced fit” mechanism and highlighted Arg411
with respect to hydrogen bonding of the MHET carboxylate
group, both of which are proposed to be drivers of substrate
specificity. In addition, beyond engineering a starting point for
BHET activity in MHETase for further optimization, the potential
for MHEF turnover was suggested, given the proposed utility of
PEF as a bio-based PET replacement (57). In our previous work
(29), we demonstrated that PETase effectively depolymerizes
PEF, but the results here do not indicate the same for MHETase
on MHEF, and docking simulations agree with the observed
patterns in MHETase selectivity. Despite success with predicting a
low-energy catalytically competent binding mode for MHET to
MHETase, we were only able to predict one binding mode of
MHEF to MHETase with the MHEF nucleophilic carbonyl in the
oxyanion hole, but in this pose the MHEF carboxylate moiety is
not in range to interact with Arg411, suggesting that further active
site engineering will be necessary to enable MHEF turnover.
Similarly, only one binding mode for MHEI was predicted
wherein the catalytic triad was oriented for catalysis but, akin to
MHEF, the nonlinearity of the molecule prevents simultaneous
interaction with the oxyanion hole and R411.
The enzyme kinetics studies presented here reveal a substantial
reduction in activity for the S131G, E226T, and F495I MHETase
mutants, indicating that these positions play important roles in
substrate specificity and catalytic efficiency. A previous study also
demonstrated greatly reduced hydrolytic activity by a F415S vari-
ant (36). Additionally, two homologs identified via bioinformatics
analysis from C. thiooxydans and Hydrogenophaga sp. PML113
exhibit extremely similar active site environments (Fig. 3D), with
the only exceptions being variations at positions 131 and 415
(MHETase numbering), and these homologs display reaction ef-
ficiencies (k
cat/Km) reduced by an order-of-magnitude (SI Appen-
dix,T a b l eS 3). Furthermore, as the amino acids at these positions
in wild-type MHETase are less common in tannase family se-
quences (SI Appendix,F i g .S 9), and mutation to the more common
amino acids led to a reduction in activity, this suggests that these
two sequence positions were specifically evolved in MHETase to
accommodate MHET.
Two-enzyme systems for complete PET degradation have been
examined previously, either derived from a single microorganism
(e.g., Thermobifida fusca) (58) or screened from multiple sources
for optimal activity (25, 59). The enzyme synergy results for theI.
sakaiensis PETase/MHETase system on amorphous PET display a
clear performance improvement when MHETase is included in
the reaction. Namely, overall degradation scales with PETase
loading within the tested range (0 to 2.0 mg PETase/g PET), but
the inclusion of MHETase in the degradation reaction markedly
improves depolymerization and this synergistic enhancement also
scales with MHETase loading.
The presence of confirmed MHETase homologs inC. thiooxydans
and Hydrogenophagasp. PML113 suggests that these bacteria may
harbor abilities for TPA catabolism (SI Appendix,F i g .S 1 7). Bio-
informatics analysis was thus conducted to query the genomes
of the strains compared to known TPA catabolic genes fromI.

dehydrogenase, and the three types of protocatechuate (PCA)
dioxygenases (PCA-2,3, PCA-3,4, and PCA-4,5-dioxygenases) (SI
Appendix,T a b l eS 5). This analysis revealed that neitherC. thio-
oxydans nor Hydrogenophagasp. PML113 harbor putative PETase
genes. Interestingly, both strains exhibit genes encoding for TPA
catabolic enzymes and transporters highly homologous to those of
I. sakaiensis, Comamonas sp. E6, andD. tsuruhatensis(in all cases
above 60% identity) (SI Appendix, Figs. S18 and S19), suggesting
that they are highly likely able to turnover TPA to PCA, a com-
mon central intermediate in aerobic aromatic catabolic pathways
(66). Each strain also contains annotated PCA-4,5-dioxygenases
(SI Appendix, Table S5). Further experimental work will be re-
quired to understand if either of these bacteria exhibit the ability
to depolymerize PET, perhaps through another type of mecha-
nism than via ester hydrolases, or perhaps likeComamonas sp. E6,
they are primarily able to consume soluble, xenobiotic interme-
diates. Perhaps these strains could serve as useful sources of TPA
catabolic genes for synthetic biology efforts associated with bio-
logical plastics recycling and upcycling (67).
The enzymatic deconstruction of recalcitrant natural poly-
mers, such as cellulose, hemicellulose, and chitin, is accom-
plished in nature by the action of mixtures of synergistic enzymes
secreted from microbes (68, 69). For example, as observed in
fungal cellulase systems for cellulose depolymerization, these
mixtures typically contain a subset of enzymes to act directly on
solid polymeric substrates via interfacial enzyme mechanisms,
and complementary enzymes (e.g.,β-glucosidases) that further
process solubilized intermediates to monomeric constituents (e.g.,
cellobiose hydrolysis to glucose). Given that natural microbial
systems evolved over millions of years to optimally degrade
recalcitrant polymers, perhaps it is thus not surprising, in
hindsight, that a soil bacterium such asI. sakaiensis evolved the
ability to utilize a crystalline polyester substrate with, to our
collective knowledge, a two-enzyme system (10, 16). Extending
the analogy of cellulase enzymes and plant cell wall decon-
struction for breaking down diverse polysaccharides simulta-
neously, the concept of deconstructing synthetic polymers in
the form of mixed plastics waste with advanced enzyme mix-
tures is an exciting research direction beyond PET to other
polyesters, natural fibers (e.g., cellulose from cotton, proteins
from wool) (70), polyamides, polyurethanes (71), and other poly-
mers susceptible to enzymatic depolymerization. Going forward,
the design of multienzyme systems for depolymerization of mixed
polymer wastes is a promising and fruitful area for continued
investigation.
