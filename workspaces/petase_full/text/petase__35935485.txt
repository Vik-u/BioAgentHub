Polybutylene adipate terephthalate (PBAT) is a biodegradable alternative to polyethylene
and can be broadly used in various applications. These polymers can be degraded by
hydrolases of terrestrial and aquatic origin. In a previous study, we identiﬁed tandem
PETase-like hydrolases (Ples) from the marine microbial consortium I1 that were highly
expressed when a PBAT blend was supplied as the only carbon source. In this study, the
tandem Ples, Ple628 and Ple629, were recombinantly expressed and characterized. Both
enzymes are mesophilic and active on a wide range of oligomers. The activities of the Ples
differed greatly when model substrates, PBAT-modiﬁed polymers or PET nanoparticles
were supplied. Ple629 was always more active than Ple628. Crystal structures of Ple628
and Ple629 revealed a structural similarity to other PETases and can be classiﬁed as
member of the PETases IIa subclass,α/β hydrolase superfamily. Our results show that the
predicted functions of Ple628 and Ple629 agree with the bioinformatic predictions, and
these enzymes play a signiﬁcant role in the plastic degradation by the consortium.

1 INTRODUCTION
Biodegradable plastics have been introduced to the market as an ecologically-friendly alternative to
recalcitrant plastics (Platt, 2006). These are especially used in applications where the desired product
is intended to have a short life (e.g., single-use plastics), and recycling is not feasible or possible (Wei
et al., 2020). Difﬁculties in recycling might appear when plastics contain other types of materials (e.g.,
paper and other organic matter) (Hopewell et al., 2009; Hahladakis and Iacovidou, 2019). One such
biodegradable polymer is polybutylene adipate co-terephthalate (PBAT). PBAT is an aliphatic-
aromatic co-polyester synthesized by polycondensation of terephthalic acid (T), adipic acid (A) and
1, 4-butanediol (B) (Jian et al., 2020). Due to its composability and similarity in mechanical

properties, it is marketed as a biodegradable alternative to
polyethylene and is widely used to manufacture agricultural
mulch ﬁlms, plastic bags, and paper coatings (BASF, 2022). At
the same time, PBAT can be used as a carbon source due to its
bioavailability and its low crystallinity makes it accessible to
enzymatic degradation ( Tiso et al., 2022 ). The formed
products T, A, and B can be further up-cycled to produce new
materials (Tiso et al., 2022).
There are numerous known enzymes with PBAT hydrolytic
activity. These are cutinase-like serine hydrolases (Kleeberg et al.,
2005; Thumarat et al., 2012; Perz et al., 2016b) that originate from
the terrestrial environment or the aquatic environment (Wallace
et al., 2017). Poly (ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is an aromatic
polyester, and PBAT is an aliphatic-aromatic polymer with a
terephthalate-diol component. They both share some structural
similarities in relation to the T-diol component. PETases can
degrade PET (Yoshida et al., 2016) and are assumed to degrade
PBAT polymers as well ( Kawai et al., 2020 ). Some PBAT-
degrading enzymes can also degrade PET, albeit with less
efﬁciency (Gouda et al., 2002; Kleeberg et al., 2005), possibly
due to the high proportion of aromatic moieties in PET (Marten
et al., 2005) and higher crystallinity (Wei et al., 2022). Enzymatic
PBAT degradation yields a mixture of the terephthalate-
butanediol monoester (BT) intermediate and monomers (Perz
et al., 2016b). Similarly, the degradation of PET yields a mixture
of mono-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET), bis (2-
hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) and monomers (Yoshida
et al., 2016). Not all PBAT-degrading enzymes can degrade the
BT intermediate: Thc_Cut1 cutinase from Thermobiﬁda
cellulosilytica can degrade PBAT efﬁciently to its monomers
(Perz et al., 2016b), while PpEst fromPseudomonas alcaligenes
cannot degrade the BT intermediate and is inhibited by it
(Wallace et al., 2017 ). Although HiC, a cutinase from
Humicola insolens, is not inhibited by BHET and MHET when
incubated with PET (Eugenio et al., 2021), the release of BT after
degradation of a PBAT-blend by HiC seems to inhibit the activity
of the enzyme (Perz et al., 2016b). Among these enzymes, only
PpEst ( Wallace et al., 2017 ) originates from the aquatic
environment. PE-H from the marine bacterium Pseudomonas
aestusnigri was shown to degrade PET, but the activity of this
enzyme was not tested on PBAT (Bollinger et al., 2020).
We have previously identi ﬁed two putative PETase-like
enzymes (Ples) from a marine microbial consortium, named
“I1,” which grows on a commercial PBAT-blendﬁlm (ecovio
®
FT 2341) as the only carbon source (Meyer-Cifuentes et al., 2020).
These enzymes were named Ple628 and Ple629. The genes
encoding for these enzymes are in tandem, with a few
hundred bases and no open reading frames in between. The
enzymes were characterized asα/β hydrolases, and had the lipase/
esterase signature GXSXG (Ollis et al., 1992; Arpigny and Jaeger,
1999). They are closely related to each other (74% amino acid (aa)
identity) and to know PETases such as theIdeonella sakaiensis
PETase (IsPETase) (A0A0K8P6T7, GAP38373) (Yoshida et al.,
2016), leaf compost cutinase LCC (AEV21261.1) (Sulaiman et al.,
2012) and Thermobiﬁda fusca cutinase Thf42_Cut1
(ADV92528.1) ( Herrero Acero et al., 2011 ) (45 – 50% aa
identity). Metatranscriptomic and proteomic analyses showed
that the genes encoding these enzymes were highly upregulated
during incubation with the commercial PBAT-blend, and the
production of the proteins increased, especially in the bioﬁlm
growing on the plasticﬁlm (Meyer-Cifuentes et al., 2020). We
postulated that these enzymes perform the depolymerization of
ecovio
® FT 2341, and in the process release BT (named previously
as “Bte”) as well as aliphatic oligomers (Meyer-Cifuentes et al.,
2020). The BT then gets degraded to B and T by a third enzyme,
Mle046, whose function we have recently veri ﬁed after
recombinant expression and biochemical analysis ( Meyer-
Cifuentes and Öztürk, 2021 ). The functions of Ple628 and
Ple629, their differences and biochemical properties, however,
remained unveriﬁed.
In this study, we recombinantly expressed, puri ﬁed and
characterized Ple628 and Ple629 as marine PET hydrolases. In
this framework, we comparatively analyze their kinetic
properties, degradation products, and activity on smaller
PBAT oligomers (supplied as powder), ecovio
®FT, PBAT, and
PBSeT (supplied asﬁlm), as well as PET nanoparticles. We also
elucidate and analyze the structures of both proteins by
crystallography.
2 RESULTS
2.1 Ple628 and Ple629 Puriﬁcation and
Identiﬁcation
The Ple628 and Ple629 sequences were retrieved from a previous
study (Meyer-Cifuentes et al., 2020). Phylogenetic analysis of
Ple628 and Ple629 and other PETase-like enzymes were described
in more detail in the previously mentioned study ( Meyer-
Cifuentes et al., 2020 ). These two enzymes were
phylogenetically classiﬁed as type IIa PETases (Supplementary
Figure S1). Additionally, theple628 and ple629 sequences used in
this study were codon optimized for recombinant protein
expression. We successfully produced and puriﬁed Ple628 and
Ple629 fromE. coliOrigami (DE3). The sizes were similar to those
predicted bioinformatically (32.6 and 31.7 kDa for Ple628 and
Ple629, respectively) (Supplementary Figure S2). The purest
fractions of each protein were pooled and used in this study.
The substrates and degradation products that were tested and
measured in this study are given inFigure 1.
2.2 Kinetic Parameters of Ple628 and Ple629
To further analyze the differences observed between Ple628 and
Ple629, we determined their enzymatic kinetic parameters,Km
and kcat. These parameters were obtained by measuring the
hydrolysis of (4-nitrophenyl) acetate ( pNPA). We observed
that Ple628 had a higher af ﬁnity for the substrate pNPA
compared to Ple629. Ple628 required 1.8 mM of the substrate
to saturate half of the Ple628 present in the reaction, while Ple629
required 2.1 mM. However, the calculated turnover rate was
higher for Ple629 (284.5 min
−1) than for Ple628 (269.9 min−1).
This observation indicates that Ple629 hydrolyses the small
substrate pNPA somewhat faster than Ple628.
The kinetic parameters of Ple629 on ecovio
®FT ﬁlm were
calculated by plotting different Ple629 concentrations against the

rates of ecovio ®FT degradation [inverse Michaelis-Menten
(invMM)]. This method allows the analysis of enzymatic
activities and subsequent calculation of kinetic parameters of
enzymes acting on insoluble substrates (Bååth et al., 2021; Vogel
et al., 2021). For the analysis, we tested concentrations from 0.5 to
6.5 µM of Ple629 and measured the formation of BT and T. The
highest degradation rate was achieved with 4.5 µM of Ple629. The
invKm is 1.86 µM and theinvkcat is 0.017 h−1.
2.3 Activity of Ple629 and Ple628 on Small
Terephthalate-Esters
We analyzed the range of action of both enzymes, Ple629 and
Ple628, on oligomeric model substrates of PBAT and PET. The
substrates tested were bis(2-(benzoyloxy)ethyl) terephthalate (3-
PET), bis(4-(benzoyloxy)butyl) terephthalate (3-PBT),
bis(hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET) and bis(4-
hydroxybutyl) terephthalate (BHBT). All these model
substrates were supplied as powder. The formation of the
degradation products, BT, MHET, and T, was monitored after
1, 2, and 24 h of incubation. For the degradation of BHET, an
additional sampling point after 30 min was included.
We observed that Ple629 could degrade 3-PET and, to some
extent, 3-PBT. Ple629 incubation with 1 mg of 3-PBT released a
maximum amount of 35.9 ± 4.1 µM of BT after 24 h (Figure 2). In
comparison, when 1 mg of 3-PET was used as the substrate, more
than 2,000 µM of MHET was formed. The catalysis of 3-PET by
Ple629 also yielded high amounts of T after 24 h of incubation
(approximately 1,900 µM of T). Formation of T after 3-PBT
degradation by Ple629 was only detected after 24 h of
incubation. Conversely, Ple629 incubation with 3-PET yielded
T readily after 1 h of incubation. Ple628 could also degrade 3-PET
but to a lesser extent than Ple629. Relative to MHET formation
after 3-PET degradation by Ple629, we detected less than 30% of
MHET formation (601.6 ± 374.1 µM of MHET) when Ple628 was
incubated with 3-PET. Consequently, Ple628 produced low
amounts of T (13.4 ± 8.0 µM) which were only detected after
24 h of incubation. Similar to Ple629, Ple628 had poor activity on
3-PBT. With Ple628, a maximum of 4.7 ± 0.8 µM of BT was
released after 24 h of incubation. Only 0.6 ± 0.5 µM of T was
detected when Ple628 was incubated after 24 h with 3-PBT.
The intermediates of 3-PET and 3-PBT degradation, BHET
and BHBT, respectively, were also degraded by Ple628 and
Ple629. Ple629 achieved maximum MHET formation after 2 h
of incubation with BHET (758.2 ± 60.9 µM) (Figure 2). T was
also formed after 30 min, and its production increased
throughout the incubation. The maximum amount of T
produced was 194.7 ± 4.3 µM after 24 h. Compared to BHET
degradation, Ple629 showed lower activity with BHBT. With
BHBT, the maximum amounts of BT and T formed after 24 h
of incubation were 513.2 ± 31.4 and 42.3 ± 1.9 µM, respectively.
Conversely, the incubation of Ple628 with the substrate BHET
produced less MHET than with Ple629. After 30 min and 24 h,
only 8.4 and 112.9 ± 2.0 µM of MHET were formed, respectively.

Meyer Cifuentes et al. Differences of Marine Tandem Ples
We did not detect T production at any time point, which indicates
that MHET was not further hydrolyzed to T and ethylene glycol.
Compared to MHET formation after BHET degradation by
Ple628, low amounts of BT were formed when BHBT was
used as the substrate. After 24 h of incubation, Ple628 could
form only 56.93 ± 5.9 µM of BT. Traces of T were detected at each
time point (1.6 ± 1.0 to 2.1 ± 0.5 µM T).
2.4 Temperature Optima of Ple628 and
Ple629
Ple628 and Ple629 were incubated at different temperatures for
72 h toﬁnd the temperature range that gave the highest activity.
When using ecovio®FT asﬁlm, we found that Ple629 and Ple628
are mostly active at 30 °C( Figure 3). Relative to the Ples
enzymatic activity observed at 30°C, the Ples retained most of
their activity when the incubation temperature was reduced to
20
°C. At 20°C, the Ple629 and Ple628 produced (relative to 30°C)
68 and 58% of BT, respectively. On the contrary, temperatures
above 30
°C negatively affected the activity of both enzymes.
When Ple628 or Ple629 were incubated at 40 °C, the BT
formation dropped to 31% and 18% compared to the product
formation at 30
°C, respectively. At 60°C, the highest temperature

the formation of BT and T. The molecular structure of each substrate is shown at the uppermost right corner of each bar plot. The sampling points are shown at 30 min,

tested, the BT formation dropped further to 12 and 0.9% for
Ple628 and Ple629, respectively. T was also formed, but only in
the presence of Ple629. Speciﬁcally, T was detected when Ple629
was incubated at 20, 30 and 40
°C exclusively. At higher
temperatures, T was undetectable. No products were released
in the absence of an enzyme at temperatures≥ of 50
°C. This
indicates that the substrate ecovio®FT and the intermediate BT
are not affected by auto-hydrolysis at 50°C.
The melting temperatures (Tms) of Ple628 and Ple629 were
determined to be 41.4°C and 38.1°C in PBS by nanoDSF, and
47.1°C and 43.2 °C by DSC ( Supplementary Table S1 ),
respectively.
2.5 Activity of Ple629 and Ple628 on
Biodegradable Plastic Films and PET
Nanoparticles
The activity of the enzymes Ple629 and Ple628 was tested on
PBAT, PBSeT, ecovio®FT ﬁlms and on PET nanoparticles (PET-
NP) at 30°C over time. We observed that both enzymes, Ple628
and Ple629, can hydrolyze all tested polymers. Compared to
Ple629, however, Ple628 was less active on all tested polymer
substrates. Ple628 produced low amounts of BT, the intermediate
product of ecovio
®FT degradation, in the presence of PBAT,
PBSeT or ecovio®FT. Even after 144 h of incubation, Ple628
produced less than 50 µM of BT with either of the tested
polymers. Ple629 yielded 1,103.6 ± 29.8, 891.5 ± 18.6 and
265.9 ± 4.2 µM of BT after 72 h with ecovio
®FT, PBSeT and
PBAT ( Figure 4 ). Comparable to the assays with the
biodegradable plastics, Ple628 produced low amounts of
MHET after PET-NP degradation. After 72 h, Ple628 released
only 52.9 ± 1.1 µM of MHET, compared to 785.9 ± 27.8 µM of
MHET released by Ple629 (Figure 4). The product formation did
not signiﬁcantly increase between 48 and 72 h of incubation for
any of the enzymes.
To some extent, Ple629 could degrade the biodegradable
plastic ﬁlms to T. After 72 h, 35.1 ± 2.5, 31.2 ± 1.6 and 18.9 ±
1.3 µM of T were detected after degradation of ecovio
®FT, PBSeT,
and PBAT, respectively ( Supplementary Figure S3 ).
Surprisingly, Ple629 released high amounts of T after PET-NP
degradation, reaching a maximum of 736.3 ± 12.0 µM after 72 h
of incubation. As expected, lower amounts (9.5 ± 1.3 µM) of T
were released in the presence of Ple628. When the plastic
polymers were supplied as the substrate, less than 1 µM of T
was formed.
Interestingly, with PBAT as the substrate, the production of
BT by Ple629 ceased after 24 h and remained the same between 48
and 72 h (265 ± 0.03 µM). This observation might indicate that
Ple629 has limited activity on PBAT compared to the other
polymers tested ( Figure 4 ). By comparing the amount of
products (BT and T) released in the presence of Ple629, we
could also observe that the enzyme degrades more efﬁciently
ecovio
®FT over PBSeT and PBAT. We detected insigniﬁcant
degradation of untreated (without addition of Ple629 or
Ple628) ecovio
®FT and PBSeT to BT (3.5– 11.0 µM BT released
after 72 h).
We additionally semi-quantitatively analyzed the release of T
and other products by LC-MS after degradation of PBAT and
PBSeT by Ple629 or Ple628. A, T and sebacic acid (S), the building
blocks of the tested PBAT-like ﬁlms and mixtures of these

respectively. The sampling points are shown at 24, 48, 72, and 144 h. The error bars indicate the standard deviation (n =3 ) .

monomers were detected ( Supplementary Figure S4 ). The
amount of each monomer increased in each reaction after 72 h
of incubation. When Ple628 was incubated with either PBAT or
PBSeT, T was detected only after 72 h. Conversely, T was readily
produced and detected after 24 h when PBAT or PBSeT were
incubated with Ple629. The amount of T produced after 72 h was
75-times higher after degradation by Ple629 than Ple628 for both
plastics. BT was the only compound detected consistently in all
assays. The amount of BT increased 3 times between 24 and 72 h
of degradation when PBAT or PBSeT was incubated with Ple629.
Approximately 1.5 times more BT was detected when PBSeT was
used as the substrate than when PBAT was used. For Ple628, no
signiﬁcant change in BT concentration was observed between
these time points. The total amount of BT produced by Ple628
was 6 times less than Ple629 when PBAT was used as a substrate,
and 10 times less when PBSeT was used. A mixture of adipate-
butanediol (A + B) was only detected after degradation of PBAT
with Ple628. Sebacic acid + butanediol (S + B) was not detected in
any assay. S and A were both detected in experiments supplied
with PBAT and PBSeT, even though PBAT does not contain S
and PBSeT does not contain A. This is likely due to cross
contamination during the successive extrusion of theﬁlms for
the study.
2.6 Inhibition of ecovio
®
FT Degradation
by BT
Films of ecovio®FT were incubated with Ple628 and Ple629 and
with increasing concentrations of BT. Previously, homologous
enzymes with PET hydrolyzing activities were found to be
inhibited by the intermediates BHET and MHET (Barth et al.,
2015, 2016). Therefore, we aimed to determine if the activities of
Ple628 and Ple629 are also inhibited by intermediates of
ecovio
®FT degradation, speciﬁcally BT. Without the addition
of BT, the degradation of 5 mg of ecovio®FT yielded 204 mg/L
of BT. Reactions supplied with more than 1,000 µM of additional
BT released less than 50% (Figure 5) of the BT formed by
subtracting the amount of supplementary BT. This observation
indicates that Ple629 is inhibited by this degradation product. As
shown before, Ple628 already had very low activity on ecovio
®FT
and released only small amounts of BT with or without the
addition of external BT. Because of this, we could not assess
product inhibition of Ple268 by BT.
2.7 Ple628 and Ple629 Sequences and
Crystal Structures Reveal Similarity to
Known PETases
For structural determination of Ple628 and Ple629, the signal
peptide sequences (M1-A25 for Ple628, and M1-A27 for Ple629)
were removed for the production of the core domain of the
protein. As predicted from the sequence homology to the lipase
and cutinase families, Ple628 and Ple629 both belong to theα/β
hydrolase superfamily, and the central twistedβ-sheet is formed
by nine mixed β-strands (β1– β9) and surrounded by eightα-
helices (Figures 6A,B). The catalytic triad S174/S179-D220/
D225-H252/H257 was conserved among all PETase-like
proteins (positions in Ple628/Ple629, respectively). Like
previously described for IsPETase and PE-H (Joo et al., 2018;
Bollinger et al., 2020; Wei et al., 2022), Ple628 and Ple629 form
two disul ﬁde bridges, DS1(C217-C254/C222-C259) and
DS2(C288-C305/C297-C314) (positions in Ple628/Ple629,
respectively). The data collection and reﬁnement statistics are
given in Supplementary Table S2.
The main structural difference between Ple628 and Ple629 was
the presence of an extended loop in Ple629, which is longer than

inhibitory concentrations of BT. Ple629 is shown as dark green diamonds and
Ple628 as gray squares. The tested BT concentrations were 0 (control),
500; 1,500; and 2,000 µM. The error bars indicate the standard deviation

the one present in Ple628, with the four extra residues S264, G265,
F266, and G267 (Figure 6C). Ple628 has a shorter extended loop,
similar to the IsPETase (Joo et al., 2018) and PE-H (Bollinger
et al., 2020 )( Figure 6D). The root-mean-square deviation
(RMSD) of atomic positions of Ple628, Ple629, and previously
characterized PETases and other hydrolases con ﬁrmed that
Ple629 is more similar to mesophilic PETases such as PE-H
and IsPETase than it is to LC-cutinase and Est119
(Supplementary Table S3). Interestingly, Ple629 is structurally
more similar to the marine PETase PE-H than to Ple628.
3 DISCUSSION
In this study, we puriﬁed and biochemically characterized two
tandem PETases from a marine microbial consortium that grows
on the aliphatic-aromatic co-polyester ecovio
®FT. These PETases
degrade a broad range of aromatic and aromatic-aliphatic
polyesters at moderate temperatures and perform theﬁrst step
of ecovio
®FT degradation by the marine consortium that they
originate from (Meyer-Cifuentes et al., 2020).
To understand the mode of action and differences between
Ple628 and Ple629, derivatives of PBAT and smaller oligomeric
model substrates were used. The other PETases and PBAT
hydrolases that are referenced in this section for comparison
are summarized in theSupplementary Table S4. We observed
that, in general, Ple628 has a lower activity with all the insoluble
polyesters tested than Ple629. In different experiments, we
detected the formation of BT, MHET, and T, with BT or
MHET being the main degradation product. Similar studies
have found that PET degradation by TfCut2, a cutinase
isolated from Thermobiﬁda fusca KW3, leads to the
production of mainly MHET (the counterpart of BT in PET
degradation) (60– 70%), followed by BHET (14%) and T (8– 32%)
(Wei et al., 2016). Other studies also showed that some PETases,
such asIsPETase, Mors1, PE-H and LCC, produce mainly MHET
as the primary hydrolysis product rather than T after PET
degradation ( Yoshida et al., 2016 ; Bollinger et al., 2020 ;
Blázquez-Sánchez et al., 2021; Erickson et al., 2022). However,
other studies have observed T as the main hydrolysis product
rather than MHET when IsPETase was incubated with
amorphous PET ﬁlms ( Joo et al., 2018 ; Blázquez-Sánchez
et al., 2021). In contrast to the assays performed by Yoshida
et al. (Yoshida et al., 2016), Blazquez-Sanchez et al. (Blázquez-
Sánchez et al., 2021) and Joo et al. (Joo et al., 2018), both used
higher amounts of IsPETase (>100 nm) and longer incubation
times (>24 h). This is an indication that the main source of T
release was the hydrolysis of the secondary degradation from
other oligomers, including MHET itself. IsPETase degrades
MHET but at a very slow rate, and this was observed for
other IsPETase variants as well (Brott et al., 2021).
During PET degradation, the formation of T is also possible to
a lesser degree due to terminal digestions of the polymer
containing T-terminal by PETase-like enzymes ( Joo et al.,
2018). In our study, T was produced to some extent, especially
when BHET and PET-NP were supplied as the substrate. This
observation suggests that BHET is a better substrate for Ple628
and Ple629 than its counterpart substrate, BHBT. During the
degradation of ecovio
®FT and its blend components, BT tended
to accumulate as a degradation product. The further hydrolysis of
this intermediate to T requires several hours in most cases.
Similar to our study, low degradability of the hydrolysis
products of PET degradation by single hydrolases has been
observed before ( Kleeberg et al., 2005 ). For instance low
degradability of MHET by the cutinase HiC from Humicola
insolens has been observed repeatedly (Carniel et al., 2017; de
Castro et al., 2017). Likewise, another study performed on two
cutinases, HiC and Thc-Cut1, the latter isolated from T.
cellulosilytica, showed that HiC has poorer activity on the
products released after the degradation of PBAT than Thc-
Cut1, and Thc-Cut1 converted BHBT to T without the
accumulation of BT (Perz et al., 2016b). In contrast to HiC,
Ples have higher activity on T esteriﬁed with shorter alcohols
(BHET over BHBT). Yet, HiC can degrade BHET quickly when
supplied as a single substrate (Carniel et al., 2017). With PBAT,
HiC cleaved butanediol-adipic acid ester bonds (B + A) better
than BT (Perz et al., 2016b). It must be stressed, however, that in
nature, ecovio
®FT, PBAT, and PBSeT can be completely degraded
by the action of other microbes in the consortium carrying
downstream-pathway enzymes required for the complete
mineralization of these biodegradable polymers ( Meyer-
Cifuentes et al., 2020).
The activity of Ples on ecovio
®FT can be limited by product
inhibition, e.g., BT. Similarly to our observations that BT inhibits
ecovio®FT degradation, Barth et al. (Barth et al., 2015) found that
the cutinase TfCut2 can be inhibited by the PET degradation
products, MHET and BHET. Additionally, they observed that
both products have a similar effect on the hydrolysis of PET by
TfCut2. The same was observed for another cutinase, the LCC
(Barth et al., 2016). In natural environments, the inhibition of
Ples by BT can be relieved by the presence of another type of
enzyme, namely Mles, as described before (Meyer-Cifuentes et al.,
2020; Meyer-Cifuentes and Öztürk, 2021).
The
invMM kinetics on ecovio®FT showed that the maximal
turnover rates were achieved at 4.5 µM Ple629, after which a
saturation point was reached, and the turnover rates dropped. A
similar phenomenon was observed during the degradation of PET
by HiC, TfC, andIsPETase (Bååth et al., 2021), as well as the LCC
(Abhijit et al., 2018), and it is explained by the overcrowding of
the enzyme surface (Mukai et al., 1993; Hiraishi et al., 2010; Bååth
et al., 2021) and the rapid depletion of suitable attack sites on the
enzyme surface (Scandola et al., 1998). The
invKm value of Ple629
on ecovio®FT of 1.86 µM is higher than that ofIsPETase on PET
at 40°C (0.039) and TfC and HiC on PET at 50°C (0.026 and 0.043,
respectively) by approximately 50-times (Bååth et al., 2021).
Although the results are difﬁcult to compare as the substrates
used are different, ecovio®FT required more enzyme to reach
saturation than PET.
Bååth et al., observed that 3-PET (denoted as BETEB in the
publication) gave much higher turnover rates than amorphous
PET (Bååth et al., 2021) with IsPETase. PBAT hydrolases Ppest
(Wallace et al., 2017) and Cbotu_EstA (Perz et al., 2016a) released
more products when 3-PBT (denoted as BABuTABuBA in these
publications) was used than when PBAT was used. In our study,
Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www.frontiersin.org July 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 9301407
Meyer Cifuentes et al. Differences of Marine Tandem Ples
Ple629 released more products per mol enzyme when the model
substrate 3-PET was used compared to nano-PET particles, but
much less when 3-PBT was used compared to ecovio
®FT and its
blend components. Perz et al., also observed that the degradation
rates for 3-PBT were much lower than for PBAT (Perz et al.,
2016b). It has been previously demonstrated that molecules that
contain more aliphatic domains are more readily degraded than
those that contain a high proportion of B + T bonds, which are
very rigid (Gan et al., 2004; Marten et al., 2005; Kasuya et al., 2009;
Perz et al., 2016b). PBAT also has a low crystallinity (around
10%), while 3-PBT is highly crystalline, which may account for its
low degradability (Perz et al., 2016b). Similar to 3-PET and 3-
PBT, far more degradation products were released when BHET
was used compared to BHBT, suggesting that this substrate
possibly ﬁts the enzyme active site better.
The degradation of PET-NP has been analyzed similarly with
IsPETase and variants ofIsPETase at different temperatures in a
previous study (Brott et al., 2021). By comparing the total amount
of products formed after 24 h of incubation at 30
°C we observed
that Ple629 presents better activity than theIsPETase wild type
(WT) and than each variant tested in that study (Brott et al.,
2021). Between 30 and 60°C, IsPETase WT and the different
IsPETase variants produced less than 400 µM of MHET, T and
BHET together, while Ple629 produced more than 1,200 µM of
MHET and T together. The activity was comparable to the
activity of an engineered high-thermal stability variant of
IsPETase, namely DuraPETase, and its variants incubated at
60
°C, which indicates that Ple629 has enhanced degradation
capabilities towards PET-NP. Similarly, DuraPETase has
increased degradation activity against highly crystalline PET
ﬁlms compared to IsPETase ( Cui et al., 2021 ). Unlike
IsPETase and DuraPETase, however, Ple629 did not degrade
PET ﬁlm.
The crystal structures of Ple628 and Ple629 are highly similar
to those of previously characterized PETases. Both enzymes are
classiﬁed as IIa PETases (Supplementary Figure S1), like the
other characterized marine PETase, PE-H (Bollinger et al., 2020).
Both enzymes possessed two disul ﬁde bonds. The second
disul ﬁde bond, which is in the proximity of the active site,
was shown to improve the activity ofIsPETase (Fecker et al.,
2018; Joo et al., 2018), and is also present in the other type IIa
and IIb enzymes such as PE-H (Bollinger et al., 2020 )a n d
Mors1 ( Blázquez-Sánchez et al., 2021 )( Supplementary
Figure S1).
Other activities of other tandem cutinases with high amino
acid identity have previously been shown to be different, both on
small substrates and plastic polymers (Herrero Acero et al., 2011;
Thumarat et al., 2015; Perz et al., 2016a; Arnling Bååth et al.,
2022). The tandem cutinases in these studies had even higher
amino acid identity to each other than Ple628 and Ple629,
demonstrating that even a few amino acid differences can lead
to differences in activity in closely related enzymes. For Ple628
and Ple629, some factors that could contribute to the difference in
activity are: 1) the differences in the amino acids next to the
catalytic H (H252 in Ple628 and H257 in Ple629), which have
been shown to inﬂuence the activity ofIsPETase (Joo et al., 2018)
and PE-H (Bollinger et al., 2020); 2) the presence of a longer
extended loop in Ple629, which was previously proposed to be an
extra substrate binding site for IsPETase (Chen et al., 2018)
(Figure 6B ). Likely, a combination of these factors is
necessary to explain the difference in activity.
The ﬁndings of this study conﬁrm the proposed functions of
Ple628 and Ple629 as PET hydrolases with an activity on PBAT
and its derivatives. These enzymes depolymerize PBAT and its
derivatives, as well as PET nanoparticles to their monomers, with
the aromatic terephthalate-diol monoester as the intermediate
degradation product. In nature, the formed monomers and
oligomers are further degraded by the action of other
hydrolases, as well as oxidoreductases, lyases, etc. released by
different bacteria (Sasoh et al., 2006; Yoshida et al., 2016; Li et al.,
2020; Meyer-Cifuentes et al., 2020; Meyer-Cifuentes and Öztürk,
2021). In this study, Ple629 had higher catalytic activity than
Ple628 both on polymeric and oligomeric substrates. In our
previous study, the fold upregulation for ple628 gene
expression was higher than for ple629 during ecovio
®FT
degradation (Meyer-Cifuentes et al., 2020). The Ple629 protein
was only detected when the bioﬁlm proteome was examined
separately, and not in the whole community proteome. These
ﬁndings led to the hypothesis that Ple628 played a bigger role in
ecovio
®FT degradation than Ple629. The underlying mechanism
of gene expression regulation of these tandem cutinases is not
known, and why the less active enzyme is produced at higher
levels is unclear. Due to its much higher activity, however, we now
postulate that Ple629 could also play a signi ﬁcant role in
ecovio
®FT degradation, although its expression levels are low,
and should be included in the overall ecovio®FT degradation
mechanism by the marine microbial consortium I1.
4 MATERIALS AND METHODS
4.1 Chemicals and Substrates
Ecovio®FT 2341, and its blend components PBAT and PBSeT
were supplied by BASF SE as plastic ﬁlms. All other model
substrates were in-house synthesized. The structures and
synthesis protocols of the substrates BHET, BHBT, 3-PET, 3-
PBT, and PET-NP are given in theSupplementary Material.
4.2 Recombinant Expression and
Puriﬁcation of Ple628 and Ple629
The signal peptides for both proteins were predicted with SignalP
5.0 (Almagro Armenteros et al., 2019). These were excluded from
the ﬁnal protein construct. Codon-optimizedple628 and ple629
were synthetically produced and cloned into the pCold II plasmid
with an N-terminal His-Tag by BioCat GmbH (Germany). The
plasmids were chemically transformed intoE. coliOrigami (DE3)
(Merck, Germany) cells. Pre-cultures of 4-5 transformants were
grown at 30
°C overnight. The cultures were inoculated 1:500 into
500 ml of TB supplemented with ampicillin to an end
concentration of 100 mg/L. The cultures were grown to an
OD
600 of 0.8– 1a t 3 7°C, 140 rpm on a MaxQ™ 4,000 orbital
shaker (Fischer Scienti ﬁc, Germany). After induction with
0.5 mM IPTG, the cultures were grown further to an OD600 of
Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology | www.frontiersin.org July 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 9301408
Meyer Cifuentes et al. Differences of Marine Tandem Ples
2, and then overnight at 16°C, 140 rpm. The cell pellets were
collected by centrifugation at 4°C, 6,000 × g for 10 min in an
Avanti J-26 XPI centrifuge with a JA-14 rotor (Beckman Coulter,
United States). The pellets were frozen at−20
°C for 20 min, and
resuspended in His-Tag binding buffer (20 mM sodium
phosphate and 0.5 M NaCl, pH 7.4) at a ratio of 1:10 of the
culture volume. Cells were disrupted by sonication with a
Sonopuls HD2070 sonicator (Bandelin, Germany). Cell lysates
were cleared by centrifugation at 4
°C 15,000 × g for 30 min in an
Avanti J-26 XPI centrifuge with a JA-14 rotor (Beckman Coulter,
United States) andﬁltrated through a 0.2 µMﬁlter.
The proteins were puriﬁed in the same manner as described
previously ( Meyer-Cifuentes and Öztürk, 2021 ). Brieﬂy, the
cleared lysates were puriﬁed on a 5 ml His-Trap
TM HP afﬁnity
Ni-Sepharose column (Cytiva, Germany) connected to an
ÄKTATM Start Puri ﬁcation System (Cytiva, Germany).
Proteins were bound and elute df r o mt h ec o l u m nb yu s i n g
the predeﬁned afﬁnity puriﬁcation protocol included in the
UNICORN ® start 1.1 software (Cytiva, Germany). The purity
of the fractions presenting a peak was determined by SDS-
PAGE. These fractions were further concentrated and desalted
on a Pierce
™ Protein Concentrator PES 10K MWCO (Thermo
Fischer Scienti ﬁc, United States). The fractions were further
polished by size exclusion chromatography on a HiPrep™ 16/
60 Sephacryl ™ S-200 HR column (Cytiva, Germany)
connected to an ÄKTATM Start Puriﬁcation System (Cytiva,
Germany) in a buffer consisting of 25 mM Tris – HCl and
200 mM NaCl, pH 7.5. Fractions containing the pure
protein were determined by SDS-PAGE, pooled and
concentrated on a Pierce
™ Protein Concentrator PES 10K
MWCO (Thermo Fischer Scienti ﬁc, United States). The
concentration of the puri ﬁed protein was determined with
the Qubit Protein Assay kit and measured on a Qubit 3.0
Fluorometer (Invitrogen, United States).
4.3 Km andKcat Determination
In a 96-well-plate, the puri ﬁed Ple628 or Ple629 (end
concentration 0.005 μg/μl) was combined with pNPA with
concentrations ranging from 0.1– 2.5 mM in 60 µl PBS, pH 7.0.
The formation of 4-nitrophenolate was measured continuously at
405 nm at 20
°C in a TECAN In ﬁnite® M200 plate reader
(TECAN, Switzerland) and retrieved using the TECAN
i-control v. 1.5.14.0 software (TECAN, Switzerland). The
concentration of 4-nitrophenolate was calculated using a
standard series in the reaction buffer and measured under the
same conditions. Each assay was performed in triplicate.Km,
Vmax and kcat were determined by non-linear least squares
regression (http://biomodel.uah.es/en/metab/enzimas/MM-
regresion.htm, last accessed 19.10.2021).
4.4 Activity Assay on Small
Terephthalate-Esters
Activity assays with BHET and BHBT were performed in 20%
DMSO in PBS, pH 7.0, to keep the substrates soluble at aﬁnal
concentration of 0.5 mM. As the substrates 3-PET and 3-PBT
were not soluble in this reaction buffer, they were treated as
insoluble substrates, and the reactions were performed in PBS,
pH 7.0. One mg of 3-PET or 3-PBT was used per assay. The
ﬁnal reaction volume for each experiment was 200μl, and the
ﬁnal concentration of Ple628 or 629 was 0.156 µM. 50 µl of
sample was taken after 1, 2, and 24 h. An additional 50 µl
samples were taken for the BHET assays after 30 min. The
reactions were stopped by the addition of 50 µl of cold
methanol. The inactivated reactions were centrifuged for
10 min at 12,000 × g at 20
°C to remove the debris, and the
ﬁltrates were transferred to HPLC vials. The degradation
products BT and T were detected with a 1260 Inﬁnity II LC
System (Agilent Technologies, United States) equipped with
an Agilent Poroshell 120 HPH-C18 column (Agilent
Technologies, United States). The measurement protocol
was modi ﬁed from Palm et al., ( Palm et al., 2019 ). A
gradient of acetonitrile 99.9% HPLC grade (Fischer
Scienti ﬁc, United States) and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid
(98– 100% Suprapur
®, Sigma-Aldrich, United States) in
Milli-Q water was used. The ﬂow rate was set at 0.2 ml/min.
10 µl of the sample was injected. Acetonitrile was increased
from 5 to 44% until minute 12 and then to 70% at minute 15,
remaining constant for 3 min. Both products were detected at
240 nm and the quantiﬁcation was realized using calibration
curves. Reactions without the enzyme were used as negative
controls. Trace amounts of product formed in the negative
controls were subtracted from the enzyme assay results during
the calculation. Each assay was performed in triplicate.
4.5 Determination of Melting Points
The melting points of Ple628 and Ple629 were determined by
nano differential scanning ﬂuorimetry using the Prometheus
NT.48 (NanoTemper Technologies, Germany). The
measurement was conducted in ddH
20 and PBS buffer (pH
7.4) using a protein concentration of 1 mg/ml and a
temperature pro ﬁle from 20 to 95
°Ca t1 °C/min. The
instrument has a ﬁxed excitation wavelength of 285 nm in
combination with emission wavelengths of 330 and 350 nm.
4.6 Activity Assay on Biodegradable Plastic
Films and PET-NP
To determine the optimum temperature for ecovio ®FT
degradation, 0.156 µM of Ple628 or Ple629 were incubated
with 5 mg of ecovio
®FT, supplied as ﬁlm, in 500 µl of PBS at
temperatures between 20 – 60°C, with 10°C increments. After
72 h, the concentrations of BT and T were measured as
described above. Each assay was performed in triplicate.
To quantify the degradation of ecovio
®FT, PBAT and
PBSeT, 5 mg of each plastic substrate was immersed in
500 µl of PBS, pH 7.0. Ple628 or Ple629 was added to each
a s s a yt u b et oaﬁnal concentration of 0.156 µM. The reactions
were incubated at 30
°C. 50 µl samples were taken after 24, 48,
and 72 h for incubations with Ple629 and after 24 and 144 h of
incubation with Ple628. The concentrations of BT and T were
measured as described above. Reactions without the enzyme
were used as negative controls. Each assay was performed in
triplicate. Additionally, the full spectrum of degradation

products was determined by LC-MS. Samples were analyzed
using a 6545 Q-TOF mass spectrometer coupled to a 1290
series HPLC (Agilent, Germany) using an Acquity BEH C18
column (particle size 1.7 µM, 2.1 × 150 mm, Waters,
United States). The samples were run with a 1 µl injection
volume at 35
°C. The eluents were A (water + 0.1% formic acid)
and B (acetonitrile + 0.1% formic acid) using the following
gradient: 5– 44% B in 12 min, 44– 70% B in 3 min, and 70% B for
an additional 3 min. Compounds were detected by recording a
DAD spectrum (230 – 640 nm) and by mass spectrometry in
negative mode in a mass range of 100 – 1000 m/z with the
following ESI settings: gas temperature 300
°C, drying gas
8 L/min, nebulizer 18 psig, sheath gas 350°Ca n d1 2 L / m i n ,
capillary voltage 3 kV and fragmentor 180 V. MassHunter
version B.08.00 software was used for data evaluation.
Heterogenous kinetics of ecovio
®FT degradation by Ple629 were
determined as described before using inverse Michaelis-Menten
kinetics (enzyme concentration vs rate,
invMM) (Scandola et al.,
1998; Ronkvist et al., 2009; Wei et al., 2016; Bååth et al., 2021). To
determine theinvMM kinetics of Ple629, 5 mg of ecovio®FT ﬁlm
was incubated with Ple629, concentrations ranging from
0.5– 6.5 µM in 500 ml of PBS, pH 7.0. 50 µl samples were taken
after 6 and 24 h, and the concentrations of T and BT were
measured as described above. Assays without the enzyme were
used as negative controls. Each assay was performed in triplicate.
The inverseKm(
invKm) andkcat (invkcat) values were calculated
with the linearized form of the kinetic function 1/V against 1/E0.
The following formula was used:
v0 /equals kcat · S0 · E0
Km + E0 , (1)
where V is the substrate degradation rate measured as (µM BT
produced/h)+ (µM T produced/h), S0 is the substrate amount in
mg, and E0 is the enzyme concentration in µM.
PET-NP was produced as previously described (Brott et al.,
2021; Pfaff et al., 2021; Vogel et al., 2021). One hundred µg (0.2 mg/
ml) PET-NP were hydrolyzed by 10 µg of Ple628 or Ple629 in a
reaction volume of 500 µL. The degradation was performed in
triplicates in PBS buffer (pH 7.4) at 30
°C and 1,000 rpm for 24, 48,
and 72 h in a ThermoMixer C (Eppendorf AG, Germany). The
hydrolysis products were analyzedvia reverse-phase HPLC on a
VWR Hitachi LaChrom Elite system (VWR International,
United States) equipped with a Kinetex
® column (5 µM EVO
C18 100 Å, 150 × 4.6 mm; Phenomenex®, Germany). Ten µl
injected sample were separated at 30 °Cw i t hag r a d i e n to f
acetonitrile and 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in water. Acetonitrile
was increased from 5 to 44% over 12 min and then to 70% over
3 min, after which the ratio remained constant for a further 3 min,
using a ﬂow rate of 0.8 ml/min. The amounts of T, MHET, and
BHET were detectedvia UV at 240 nm and the quantiﬁcation was
realized using calibration curves.
4.7 Crystallization, Data Collection,
Structure Determination
The genes encoding Ple628 and Ple629 were chemically
synthesized by GENE ray Biotech Co. (China) and ligated
into the pET32a vector. The plasmids were transformed into
E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells which were grown in LB medium at
37°Ct oa nO D600 of 0.8 and then induced by 0.4 mM IPTG at
16°C for 24 h. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 ×
g for 15 min, then re-suspended in lysis buffer containing
2 5 m MT r i s - H C l ,p H7 . 5 ,1 5 0 m MN a C l ,a n d2 0 m M
imidazole, followed by disruption with a French Press
(Thermo Electron, United States). Cell debris was removed
by centrifugation at 17,000 × g for 1 h. The supernatant was
then applied to a Ni-NTA column FPLC system (GE
Healthcare, United States). The target proteins eluted at
100 mM imidazole when using a 20 – 250 mM imidazole
gradient. Proteins were dialyzed against buffer containing
25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 150 mM NaCl, and subjected
to TEV protease digestion, overnight, to remove the 6x His tag.
The mixtures were then passed through another Ni-NTA
column. Untagged proteins were eluted with 25 mM Tris-
HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl. After washing unbound
proteins, the target protein was puri ﬁed by using a DEAE
Sepharose Fast Flow (Cytivia, Germany) and then a HiLoad
16/600 Superdex 200 GF column (Cytivia, Germany). The
purity of proteins ( >95%) was checked by SDS-PAGE
analysis. The puri ﬁed proteins were concentrated to 25 mg/
ml for crystallization screening.
All crystallization experiments were conducted at 25
°C using
the sitting-drop vapor-diffusion method. In general, 1 µL Ple628
containing solution (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl;
25 mg/ml) was mixed with 1 µL of reservoir solution in 48-well
Cryschem Plates (Hampton Research, United States), and
equilibrated against 100 µL of the reservoir solution. The
optimized crystallization condition of Ple628 was 20% PEG
8000, 0.2 M calcium acetate, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5.
The optimized crystallization condition of Ple629 (25 mM Tris-
HCl, pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl; 23 mg/ml) was 30% PEG 8000, 0.2 M
ammonium acetate, 0.1 M tri-sodium citrate dihydrate, pH 5.6.
Within 5– 6 days, the crystals reached dimensions suitable for
X-ray diffraction.
The X-ray diffraction data sets were collected at beam line
BL02U1 of SSRF and BL17B, BL18U1, and BL19U1 beamline
of National Facility for Protein Science in Shanghai (NFPS) at
the Shanghai Synchrotron Radiation Facility ( Zhang et al.,
2019). The Ple628 crystals were mounted in a cryoloop and
soaked with cryoprotectant s olution (21% PEG 8000, 0.4 M
calcium acetate, 0.1 M sodium cacodylate, pH 6.5, 20%
glycerol) prior to data collection at 100 K. The
cryoprotectant solution for Ple629 is 30% PEG 8000, 0.2 M
ammonium acetate, 0.1 M tri-Sodium citrate dihydrate, pH
5.6, and 10% glycerol. The diffraction images were processed
by using the HKL2000 software ( Otwinowski and Minor,
1997). The crystal structures of Ple628 and Ple629 were
both solved by the molecular replacement method with
Phaser (McCoy et al., 2007) using the structure of polyester
hydrolase from Pseudomonas aestusnigri (PDB code 6SCD)
(Bollinger et al., 2020)a sas e a r c hm o d e l .F u r t h e rr eﬁnement
was carried out using the programs Phenix v 1.19.2 (Afonine
