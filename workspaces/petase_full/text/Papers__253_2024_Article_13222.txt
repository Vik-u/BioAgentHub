Abstract 
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a major component of plastic waste. Enzymatic PET hydrolysis is the most ecofriendly 
recycling technology. The biorecycling of PET waste requires the complete depolymerization of PET to terephthalate and 
ethylene glycol. The history of enzymatic PET depolymerization has revealed two critical issues for the industrial depo-
lymerization of PET: industrially available PET hydrolases and pretreatment of PET waste to make it susceptible to full 
enzymatic hydrolysis. As none of the wild-type enzymes can satisfy the requirements for industrialization, various mutational 
improvements have been performed, through classical technology to state-of-the-art computational/machine-learning tech-
nology. Recent engineering studies on PET hydrolases have brought a new insight that flexibility of the substrate-binding 
groove may improve the efficiency of PET hydrolysis while maintaining sufficient thermostability, although the previous 
studies focused only on enzymatic thermostability above the glass transition temperature of PET. Industrial biorecycling 
of PET waste is scheduled to be implemented, using micronized amorphous PET. Next stage must be the development of 
PET hydrolases that can efficiently degrade crystalline parts of PET and expansion of target PET materials, not only bottles 
but also textiles, packages, and microplastics. This review discusses the current status of PET hydrolases, their potential 
applications, and their profespectal goals.
Key points
• PET hydrolases must be thermophilic, but their operation must be below 70 °C
• Classical and state-of-the-art engineering approaches are useful for PET hydrolases
• Enzyme activity on crystalline PET is most expected for future PET biorecycling

Introduction
Global plastic production began in the 1950s. Approxi-
mately 60% of plastics are discarded in the environment, 
where they persist, maintaining nearly the same proper -
ties and amounts as the original plastic due to their high 
durability and resistance (Geyer et al. 2017; Pandey et al. 
2023). Plastic waste is ubiquitous and can be found from 
the heights of Mount Everest (Napper et al. 2020) to the 
depths of the Mariana Trench (Chiba et al. 2018). Polyole-
fins and polyesters make up most plastic waste (Geyer et al. 
2017). Traditional methods of managing plastic waste, such 
as incineration and landfilling, are hindered by economic 
and environmental limitations. Incineration contributes to 
 CO2 emissions, which exacerbates global warming. Land-
fills contribute to pollution in terrestrial and marine environ-
ments through the release of fragments and oligomers (Sang

et al. 2020). These substances, when in the form of micro- or 
nanoparticles, are harmful to living organisms (Wang et al. 
2020; Redondo-Hasselerharm et al. 2020) and can eventu-
ally enter the human food chain (Cverenkárová et al. 2021). 
Therefore, efficient management of plastic waste is becom-
ing increasingly crucial as pollution concerns continue to 
rise.
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a clear, strong, and 
lightweight plastic that is produced by polymerizing eth-
ylene glycol and terephthalate. PET is the most produced 
polyester resin, with applications mainly in the manufacture 
of fibers for clothing and containers for food and beverages. 
It accounts for nearly 45% of single-use bottle production 
(Benyathiar et al. 2022; Wallace et al. 2020). PET bottles 
are recycled due to their high collection rates, which vary by 
country. However, PET bottles produced through mechanical 
recycling are of inferior quality compared to virgin bottles. 
Recycling is limited to a few cycles. In contrast, enzymatic 
depolymerization of PET can be practiced limitlessly, as it 
produces raw materials for PET synthesis, thus closing the 
loop from the synthesis of PET using raw materials to the 
depolymerization of waste PET to raw materials.
The initial aim of enzymatic PET degradation was to 
modify textiles, which required surface alteration without 
damaging the main body. However, unlike textile modifica-
tion, complete degradation is required for PET waste. PET 
products have varying crystallinities: amorphous PET with 
a crystallinity of approximately 10% (used in packaging) 
and crystalline (semicrystalline) PET with a crystallinity 
of 30-40% (used in bottles and textiles). Amorphous PET 
is susceptible to enzymatic hydrolysis, whereas crystalline 
PET is resistant to such attacks. Currently, there are no prac-
tical PET hydrolases available for crystalline PET products. 
However, thermophilic PET hydrolases have almost reached 
practical levels for industrial PET biorecycling, resulting 
in nearly complete depolymerization of amorphous PET 
(Tournier et al. 2020; Arnal et al. 2023; Cui et al. 2024). The 
flexibility of the PET polymer depends on the temperatures. 
Below the glass transition temperature (T g), approximately 
65-70 °C for PET in aqueous solution, the polymer is glassy. 
Above Tg, the polymer becomes rubbery and flexible (Kawai 
et al. 2019), although the polymer undergoes recrystalliza-
tion above 70 °C (Tournier et al. 2020). Enzymes cannot eas-
ily break down polymers in their glassy state. However, when 
the polymer chain becomes rubbery at temperatures above 
Tg, but below 70 °C, it becomes susceptible to enzymatic 
attack. Enzymatic hydrolysis at ambient temperatures can 
detect depolymerized products, such as bis(hydroxyethyl)
terephthalate (BHET), mono(hydroxyethyl) terephthalate 
(MHET), and terephthalate (TPA). PET includes the cyclic 
trimer of MHET, which is partially displayed on the surface 
along with any end/loop of a polymer chain and is exposed 
to surface modification through hydrolysis of ester bonds 
(Kawai et al. 2019). Enzymatic hydrolysis of PET at ambi-
ent temperature occurs only on the surface, resulting in 
minimal hydrolytic products. However, plastic pollution has 
attracted attention of the need to degrade the main block of 
PET waste. To achieve this, thermophilic PET hydrolases are 
used at temperatures above Tg. These two types of enzymes 
are commonly employed as PET hydrolases. Some sug-
gest to differentiate between two types of PET-hydrolyzing 
enzymes: PET surface-modifying enzymes and PET hydro-
lases (Kawai et al. 2019). This distinction has gained accept-
ance within the scientific community (Tournier et al. 2023).
This review presents the current situation of PET hydro-
lases for the biorecycling of waste PET. The feasibility of 
thermophilic and mesophilic enzymes as catalysts for biore-
cycling and their mutational improvements for future appli-
cations are discussed.
PET hydrolases
PET, an aromatic polyester, can be hydrolyzed by the car -
boxylic ester hydrolase family (EC 3.1.1). A thermophilic 
aromatic polyesterase was first cloned from Thermobifida 
fusca (Müller et al. 2005), which belongs to the cutinase 
group in the carboxylic ester hydrolase family and can 
degrade the main body of PET at 55 °C. Cutinases cata-
lyze the hydrolysis of cutin, a polyester found in plant cuti-
cles. Some cutinases, such as the representative cutinase of 
Fusarium solani pisi (Nimchua et al. 2007; Ronqvist et al. 
2009) can hydrolyze PET. Cutinases can readily hydrolyze 
the extreme surface area of PET at ambient temperature. 
However, enzymatic attack on the main body of PET is at 
a trace level, especially below T g (~ 65−70 °C in water), 
as the polymer chain is unwavering below Tg. Therefore, 
enzymes for biorecyling require thermostability (Kawai et al. 
2019). Empirical data suggest that PET hydrolases require 
a melting temperature (Tm) value at least 12 °C higher than 
their optimal temperature for catalytic longevity (Pfaff et al. 
2022). Therefore, enzymes should have T m values higher 
than 80 °C. Besides T g, the crystallinity of PET also influ-
ences its enzymatic degradation (Thomsen et al. 2022). 
Enzymatic degradation of crystalline PET (with a crystal-
linity of 30−40%) cannot be compared to that of amorphous 
PET (with a crystallinity of approximately 10%). Therefore, 
only detection of MHET, BHET, and TPA at low levels (< 
1−2%) for amorphous PET is considered the surface modi-
fication level. For PET hydrolases, a large amount of the 
product must be released to destroy the main body of PET (1 
mg of PET corresponds to ~ 5.2 μmol of MHET units). PET 
hydrolases, such as lipases, cutinases, esterases, carboxy -
lesterases, and papain, can hydrolyze PET surfaces without 
damaging the main body. These enzymes are categorized 
as PET surface-modifying enzymes. PET hydrolases share

common homologous structures, including α/β-hydrolases 
folds with a catalytic triad and a disulfide bond, regardless 
of their cutin-hydrolyzing activities. They are designated as 
cutinases or cutinase-like enzymes.
Although reports of PET hydrolase began in 2005 (Müller 
et al. 2005), they have not received worldwide attention, par-
ticularly from the public. In 2016, Ideonella sakaiensis was 
isolated, which was reidentified as Piscinibacter sakaiensis 
(Oren and Göker 2023). It can assimilate amorphous PET 
as a major carbon source at 30 °C and possesses a PET-
hydrolyzing enzyme, IsPETase (Yoshida et al. 2016). The 
study compared the activity of IsPETase with that of other 
cutinases, such as TfCut2 (Müller et al. 2005) and LCC 
(Sulaiman et al. 2012) at 30 °C. The results showed that 
IsPETase was more effective than the other cutinases, indi-
cating its potential as a hydrolase for decomposing waste 
PET, even at ambient temperatures. The possibility of enzy-
matic hydrolysis of PET has attracted the attention of scien-
tists and the public. Mass communication has discussed this 
topic without detailed consideration. Many researchers have 
studied PET hydrolases, and some have noted that thermo-
stability is a requirement for PET hydrolases. IsPETase has 
a low degradation ability because of its thermolability (Wei 
et al. 2019b). Several thermostable mutants of IsPETase 
have been discovered through mutational trials, including 
ThermoPETase (Son et al. 2019), DuraPETase (Cui et al. 
2021), FAST-PETase (Lu et al. 2022a), HotPETase (Bell 
et al. 2022), and Z1-PETase (Lee et al. 2023).
Joo et al. (2018) classified bacterial PET hydrolases into 
two groups. Type I enzymes are thermophilic cutinase-type 
enzymes with one disulfide bond and the lack of an exten-
sive β8-α6 loop. Type II enzymes, including IsPETase, 
are mesophilic and divided into IIa and IIb enzymes. The 
type IIa and IIb enzymes share two disulfide bonds and an 
extended β8-α6 loop but differ in the residues that constitute 
a putative secondary substrate-binding subsite (subsite II) 
and the extended loop. Based on this concept, PET hydro-
lases are classified according to their features (Table 1, Figs. 
S1 and S2). Type I enzymes share His164 and Phe243 resi-
dues in subsite II, except PHL7, where Phe is replaced with 
Leu (Sonnendecker et al. 2022). Type IIb enzymes have Trp 
and Ser/Thr at the corresponding positions, whereas type IIa 
enzymes have Trp and Phe/Tyr at the same position, except 
for PET2, where it is Trp and Trp (Meilleur et al. 2009; 
Danso et al. 2018; Nakamura et al. 2021), and CtPL, where 
it is His and Phe (Chen et al. 2021; Li et al. 2023). His, 
Phe, Trp, and Tyr are aromatic amino acids and can replace 
each other. PET27 and PET30 from Bacteroidetes, recently 
characterized by Zhang et al. (2022a) have one disulfide 
bond. However, the position of one cysteine differs from 
that of typical type I enzymes. In addition, they include an 
extended loop and Trp and Ser residues in subsite II, like 
that of IsPETase. These enzymes are cold-active esterases, 
with PET27 having a C-terminal Por-sorting domain and 
PET 30 lacking a C-terminal Por-domain. Both enzymes 
exhibit high structural similarity to that of IsPETase, indicat-
ing that their core structures are type IIb enzymes. Recently, 
based on a sequence homology analysis of the NCBI protein 
database, a PET hydrolase candidate from an actinomycete, 
Cryptosporangium aureantiacum ( CaPETase: Tm value of 
66.8 °C) was cloned, which has a type I-like structure except 
that His164 in LCC is replaced with Trp found in IsPETase, 
but Phe243 in LCC is conserved (subsite II) (Hong et al. 
2023).
Joo et al. (2018) reported that IsPETase outperforms 
type I enzymes at ambient temperatures due to two specific 
residues, Trp159 and Ser238, because the W159H/S238F 
mutation was found to reduce enzyme activity. Han et al. 
(2017) discovered that the substrate-binding residue Trp185 
in IsPETase has multiple conformations (types A, B, and C), 
whereas the equivalent residue in type I enzymes only adopts 
a C-type conformation. This structural variation is due to the 
nearby residue Ser214, which is equivalent to His in type I 
enzymes. The smaller side chain of Ser214 allows Trp185 to 
move freely, whereas His restricts the rotation of the Trp side 
chain. IsPETase requires a flexible substrate-binding struc-
ture in subsite I to accommodate the inflexible PET molecule 
at ambient temperatures. However, above T g temperature, 
the PET molecule becomes flexible, and type I enzymes 
require a rigid substrate-binding structure to capture it. Type 
IIb enzymes, in contrast, use an induced-fit mechanism to 
react, whereas type I enzymes use a lock-and-key mecha-
nism. According to Austin et al. (2018), the W159H/S238F 
mutation in IsPETase improved PET degradation, contrary

to the findings of Joo et al. (2018). IsPETase shares a high 
sequence identity with cutinases (> 43%) and adopts an α/β-
hydrolase fold that harbors a catalytic triad and substrate-
binding residues identical to those of canonical cutinases 
(Han et al. 2017; Joo et al. 2018). Unlike lipases, which have 
lids leading to interfacial activation, cutinase-like enzymes, 
including IsPETase, have open active sites without lids, in 
the same carboxyl ester hydrolase (EC 3.1.1).
Danso et al. (2018) predicted the global distribution of 
PET hydrolase homologs in bacterial and fungal phyla in 
marine and terrestrial environments, based on the Integrated 
Microbial Genome database. Biundo et al. (2017) reported 
that an esterase Cbotu_EstA cloned from Clostridium 
botulinum ATCC 3502, which has the structure of an α/β 
hydrolase with two lid domains, could marginally hydro-
lyze PET at 50 °C when the N-terminal region covering the 
catalytic site was truncated. PET46, a new enzyme with a 
lid that belongs to a feruloyl esterase, was recently cloned by 
a sequence-based metagenomic search from an uncultured 
deep-sea Candidatus, Bathyarchaeota archaeon. The enzyme 
exhibits a PET-degrading activity at 60 °C and a higher 
activity in BHET and MHET (Perez-Garcia et al. 2023). 
PET46 shares the core α/β-hydrolase fold with bacterial 
PET hydrolases but contains a unique lid domain common 
to feruloyl esterases (plant cell wall-degrading esterases). 
It is unclear whether this enzyme has any functions beyond 
the degradation of the plant cell wall in the deep-sea or if it 
is dormant. A feruloyl esterase homolog was cloned from I. 
sakaiensis as the enzyme to hydrolyze MHET (MHETase) 
that wild-type IsPETase produces from PET but cannot 
hydrolyze (Palm et al. 2019; Knott et al. 2020). However, 
MHETase is thermolabile as well as IsPETase. Polyester -
ases, Mors 1 and OaCut were cloned from the Antarctic 
bacteria Moraxella sp. strain TA144 and Oleispira antarctic 
RB-8, respectively, and hydrolyze PET at a rate comparable 
to IsPETase at 25 °C (Blázquez-Sánchez et al. 2022). The 
enzymes have Trp and Phe at the same position as His164 
and Phe243 in subsite II of the LCC, which differs from Trp 
and Ser in IsPETase and have an extended loop length, like 
type II enzymes (Table  1). The proteins discussed in this 
passage belong to the type IIa family. However, unlike PET2 
and CtPL, which are also members of this family, their T m 
values are like that of IsPETase. Mors 1 has a third disulfide 
bond near its N-terminal end, which may be an adaptation 
to low temperatures. Of note, OaCut lacks a cysteine in the 
corresponding position of the third disulfide bond.
Danso et al. (2018) was used as the basis for identifying 
a candidate PET hydrolase. Weigert et al. (2022) reported 
the prevalence PET6 homologs in Vibrios and characterized 
PET6 from Vibrio gazogenes. PET6 is like IsETase, but its 
activity was lower than IsPETase. Notably, PET6 contains a 
third disulfide bond at its N-terminus. However, the role of 
the third disulfide bond requires further investigation. Type 
IIa enzymes are hybrids of type I and IIb enzymes. Type I 
enzymes can be thermophilic, whereas type IIb enzymes are 
mesophilic. Type IIa enzymes, such as PET2 and CtPL, can 
be thermophilic, whereas Mors 1, OaCut, and Pa PETase 
(PE-H) are mesophilic. The behavior of PET hydrolases 
toward high, moderate, and low temperatures appears to be 
determined by small differences in their sequences, although 
they all share core structures as cutinases. PET hydrolysis 
requires (1) the catalytic triad and an oxyanion hole-forming 
aromatic residue, (2) an open active site, and (3) an appropri-
ate size and amino acid composition of the catalytic site to 
bind the structural units of PET, such as MHET and BHET. 
PET hydrolysis, including surface-modification, may be 
easier than previously thought, as ester bonds can be hydro-
lyzed by various hydrolytic enzymes. Erickson et al. (2022) 
identified PET-active biocatalysts from natural diversity 
using bioinformatics and machine learning. They extracted 
74 putative thermotolerant PET hydrolases (grouped into 
polyesterase-lipase-cutinases, cutinases, bacterial lipases, 
carboxylesterases, and peptidases), which revealed protein 
folds and accessory domains. Esterases, which are carboxy-
lesterases without lids, are ubiquitous in organisms. Upon 
examination, many esterases have been observed to exhibit 
hydrolysis at various levels, as demonstrated by a metagen-
omic PET hydrolase from human saliva (Eiamthong et al. 
2022). However, the hydrolytic activity for the main body 
of the PET structure is closely linked to the thermostability 
of PET hydrolases and their working temperature, which is 
close to the Tg value of PET, as described above.
The development of high throughput measurements for 
PET-hydrolyzing activities (Weigert et al. 2021; Wei et al. 
2022; Shi et al. 2023; Thomsen et al. 2023) made the screen-
ing of PET hydrolases far easier and quicker. Previous stud-
ies, starting from Müller et al. (2005), have accumulated 
information on the genetic sequences and the protein struc-
tures of PET hydrolases, which enabled the sequence-based 
screening and the computational/machine-learning search 
from metagenomic sources and databases such as the NCBI 
protein database and GenBank. Such a trial was first reported 
by Danso et al. ( 2018), proposing several PET hydrolase 
candidates, which were later characterized in detail, as 
described above (Nakamura et al. 2021; Weigert et al. 2022; 
Makryniotos et al. 2023). The number of PET hydrolases 
is rapidly increasing, based on state-of-the-art technologies 
(Erickson et al. 2022; Hong et al. 2023). Seo et al. (2024) 
extracted 2,064 non-redundant protein sequences grouped 
as polyesterase-lipase-cutinase in the database of the α/β 
hydrolase fold superfamily of proteins (Lenfant et al. 2013) 
and generated 1894 categories with 170 clusters, based on 
which 107 potential PETase were identified with sequence 
lineages. It is predicted that new enzymes capable of PET 
hydrolysis, possessing typical structural features of PET 
hydrolases (type I or II enzymes) or their mixed types, as

 Page 5 of 18 404
well as additional unique features of the protein structure, 
will emerge. However, core structures, such as Cbotu_
EstA, PET46, PET27, and PET30 will remain unchanged. 
PET hydrolases with confirmed PET hydrolytic activities 
included in this review are summarized as a phylogenetic 
tree in Fig. 1 and Table S1.
Thermophilic PET hydrolases
Type I PET hydrolases are classified as cutinases. Research 
on cutinases focused on phytopathogenic fungi, such as Bot-
rytis cinereal and Fusrium solani pici (Kawai et al. 2020). 
Later, attention shifted to polyesterases that work on syn-
thetic polyesters, which are also part of the cutinase group. 
HiC, a commercialized cutinase from Humicola insolens, 
has optimal temperature of 75−80 °C and can efficiently 
hydrolyze amorphous PET at 70 °C (Ronqvist et al. 2009). 
Both enzymes belong to the cutinase/acetylxylan esterase 
family (InterPro: IPR000675) and make a distinct phylo-
genetic branch (Paysan-Lafosse et al. 2023). Brinch-Ped-
ersen et al. (2024) selected 24 sequences from the Inter -
Pro IPR000675 family, homologous to HiC, among which 
the cutinase from Thermocarpiscus australiensis (TaC) 
performed better than HiC in the absence or presence of 
300 mM NaCl. The salt dependence could be ascribed to 
electrostatic repulsion between TaC (negative surface) and 
semicrystalline PET powder (> 40% crystallinity). Several 
variants (less negative than wild-type) showed higher activ-
ity at 50 °C and 60 °C in salt-free buffer (pH 8). In addition, 
15 fungal cutinases were cloned by a sequence homology 
analysis from the NCBI database (Lee et al. 2024). A phylo-
genetic tree analysis with two known fungal cutinases (HiC 
and FsC) showed that these fungal cutinases are divided into 
two distinct types. Type I comprises HiC, FsC, and 10 cuti-
nases with notable sequence similarities, encompassing all 
reported PET-degradable cutinases. Type II showed lower 
sequence homology with type I and significant divergence 
within them. This could be a standard for fungal cutinases. 
The InterPro IPR000675 family belongs to the α/β hydro-
lases, but the size of fungal cutinases is smaller than that 
of bacterial cutinases, comprising only 5 β-strands, which 
are covered by 5 α-helices. Bacterial cutinases comprise 9 
β-strands, which are covered by 8 α-helices. A cutinase from 
Aspergillus fumigatiaffinms (AfC) had a potent PET-hydro-
lyzing activity, and its variant  (AfC6P) completely decom-
posed the post-consumer PET film within 12 days at 60 °C, 
but its availability to biorecycling remains to be studied. 
These reports expanded the diversity of fungal PET hydro-
lases, but information on fungal PET hydrolases is limited 
compared to those on bacterial ones. It must need further 
work whether the fungal cutinases can be equivalent to bac-
terial ones (Arnal et al. 2023) or outperform them or not.
According to Danso et al. (2018), Actinobacteria are the 
main hosts of PET hydrolase genes in terrestrial environ-
ments. Thermophilic PET hydrolases have been obtained 
from various Actinomyces, including the genera Ther -
mobifida, T. fusca, T. alba, T. cellulosilytica, and Saccha-
romonospora viridis (Kawai et al. 2020; Kawai 2021) (Table 
S2). The thermophilic enzyme LCC was cloned from plant 
compost using a metagenomic approach (Sulaiman et al. 
Fig. 1  A phylogenetic tree of 31 
PET hydrolases with activi-
ties. The GenBank accession 
numbers and PDB IDs of the 
hydrolases are summarized in 
Table S1. The groups “Fungi,” 
“Actinomycetes,” “Metage-
nome,” “Bacteria other than 
actionomycetes,” and “Others” 
are colored in green, red, blue, 
black, and grey, respectively. 
A multiple sequence alignment

using the program ClustalW2 
with default settings (Larkin 
et al. 2007) and visualized by 
the program Dendroscope 3.8.3 
(Huson and Scornavacca 2012)

2012). Subsequently, BhrPETase was cloned from the ther-
mophilic bacterial phylum Chloroflexi derived from a sub-
surface geothermal stream using a metagenomic approach. 
The enzyme has a 94% sequence identity with LCC and 
exhibits a slightly better PET-hydrolyzing activity than LCC 
(Xi et al. 2021). Chloroflexi has been identified as one of 
the dominant members in compost microbial communities 
(Lu et al. 2022b). Given that the sequence identity of LCC 
with Actinomycete cutinases is less than 60%, LCC is likely 
mainly derived from Chloroflexi rather than Actinomycetes. 
Furthermore, PHL7 was recently cloned from plant compost 
using a metagenomic approach (Sonnendecker et al. 2022). 
Recently, a thermophilic polyesterase DmPETase was cloned 
from Deinococcus maricopensis. Its presence was suggested 
by Danso et al. (2018). DmPETase shares 60% identity with 
hydrolases of Thermobifida species, and LCC, and contains 
one disulfide bond. Makryniotos et al. (2023) classified this 
enzyme as a type I enzyme. Seo et al. (2024) navigated a 
natural landscape of ester-based plastic hydrolases from a 
library including 25,418 sequences using a sequence homol-
ogy network and clustered 1894 PET hydrolase candidates 
into 170 lineages. Based on this result, they discovered novel 
PET hydrolases (Mipa-P and Kubu-P) with high catalytic 
ability and high thermal stability originated from actino-
mycetes, Micromonospora pattaloongensis DSM 45254 and 
Kutzneria buriramensis IDSM 45791, from which no PET 
hydrolases have been documented (Fig. S3). Both enzymes 
have one disulfide bond and no extended loop. They share 
most of the local sub-network structures of CaPETase. How-
ever, His 164 and Phe243 in LCC, characteristic of type I 
enzymes, are not conserved. PET2 (Nakamura et al. 2021) 
and CtPL from Caldimonas taiwanensis (Chen et al. 2021; 
Li et al. 2023) are thermophilic type IIa enzymes (Table 1).
The history of 20 years’ research on PET hydrolases 
accumulated uncountable sequences from bacteria and fungi 
and the number is annually increasing. Computer-aided and 
machine-learning screening from databases would bring 
novel enzymes from unexplored sources, probably result-
ing in expansion of a variety of PET hydrolases, as described 
above.
Mesophilic PET hydrolases
Joo et al. (2018) categorized type IIb enzymes based on the 
findings of IsPETase. Danso et al. (2018) predicted the pres-
ence of various IIb enzymes. The ability of microorganisms 
to grow on PET at ambient temperatures has been demon-
strated in previous studies (da Costa et al. 2020; Moyses 
et al. 2021; Qiao et al. 2022). Furthermore, various sources 
have produced type IIb enzyme clones with thermostabil-
ity comparable to that of IsPETase (Bollinger et al. 2020; 
Chen et al. 2021; Eiamthong et al. 2022) (Table S3). Table 1 
describes the characteristics of type IIb enzymes, which 
include an additional disulfide bond, a longer extended loop 
than type I enzymes, and Trp-Ser/Thr at the corresponding 
positions of His164 and Phe243 in LCC. Both type I and II 
enzymes have a Tyr/Phe-Met-Trp substrate-binding motif 
in subsite I, which acts as an aromatic clamp (Danso et al. 
2018). Two cold-active esterases PET27 and PET30, were 
cloned from Bacteroides Aequorivita sp. and Kaistella jeo-
nii, respectively (Zhang et al. 2022a). Both enzymes lack 
additional disulfide bonds, like type I enzymes, but have a 
longer extended loop than type I and contain Trp-Ser at the 
corresponding positions of His164 and Phe243 in the LCC, 
which are characteristic features of type IIb enzymes. PET30 
has a Phe-Met-Tyr motif at subsite I, which differs from the 
consensus sequences of Tyr/Phe-Met-Trp, whereas PET27 
has a Tyr-Met-Trp motif. Tyr can replace Trp as an aromatic 
clamp. Furthermore, some type IIa enzymes, such as Pa P-
ETase/PE-H (Bollinger et al. 2020) and MG8 (Eiamthong 
et al. 2022) are mesophilic, whereas type IIa PET2 (Naka-
mura et al. 2021) and CtPL from C. taiwanensis (Chen et al. 
2021; Li et al. 2023) are thermophilic. As explained above, 
type IIa enzymes are hybrids of type I (thermophilic) and 
IIb (mesophilic) enzymes, characterized by their amino acid 
sequences and resistance to temperature.
A large amount of information has been accumulated on 
PET hydrolases, specifically regarding their sequences and 
3D structures. Various PET hydrolases have been discov -
ered, differing slightly from typical type I and II enzymes. 
Some may have additional structures like a lid or a Por-
domain. However, these enzymes conserve the core struc-
tures as described above. It is widely agreed that PET hydro-
lases must have sufficient thermostability for their use in the 
industrial biorecycling of PET (Arnal et al. 2023). Addi-
tional structures, such as the extended loop and lid, may pose 
a challenge and a simple core structure may be adequate for 
PET hydrolysis. However, wild-type I enzymes are not ade-
quate for PET biorecycling. Mutational improvements have 
been attempted to enhance the thermostability and activity 
of enzymes. Recent advancements in creating PET hydrolase 
variants are based on various technologies such as classical 
rational engineering/directed evolution and state-of-the-art 
computational/machine-aided engineering. This has led to 
a rapid increase in publications for the variants.
Engineering of type I PET hydrolases
Enzymes are crucial for industrial-scale enzymatic PET 
depolymerization, with PET hydrolysis enzymes being the 
most important. Research has focused on the engineering 
of these enzymes to improve their efficiency and optimize 
the expression system of PET hydrolase genes and reaction 
conditions. The efficiency of the enzyme is influenced by 
both the crystallinity and the size of the PET substrate. Arnal 
Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology (2024) 108:404 
 Page 7 of 18 404
et al. (2023) summarized critical parameters for enzymatic 
depolymerization in industrial settings. This section focuses 
on improving enzyme efficiency through mutation.
Metal‑binding sites
These concentrations are much higher than the typical con-
centrations of metal ions required for prosthetic groups. 
The activity and thermostability of several PET hydro-
lases are increased by the presence of these ions. Thumarat 
et al. (2012) observed that Est119 from Thermobifida alba  
AHK119 showed increased activity in the presence of 
high concentrations of  Ca2+,  Mg2+, and  Mn2+. The activ -
ity and thermostability of Cut190 (Kawai et al. 2014), LCC 
(Sulaiman et al. 2014), TfCut2, and TfCut1 (Then et al. 
2015) are increased by the presence of  Ca2+ and  Mg2+. 
These enzymes have negatively charged amino acid residues 
that bind cations at the same positions: Asp174, Asp204, and 
Glu253 in TfCut2 (Then et al. 2015) and ThCut1 (Zhang 
et al. 2022b), but Asp174 is replaced with Glu in LCC and 
Cut190. The introduction of a disulfide bond into the metal-
binding site enhances the thermostability and activity of 
TfCut2 (Then et al. 2016), Cut190 (Oda et al. 2018), LCC 
(Tournier et al. 2020), and ThcCut1 (Zhang et al. 2022b). 
The substitution of  Ca2+ with a disulfide bond enables the 
use of a phosphate buffer (precipitated with  Ca2+ or  Mg2+) 
for the enzyme reaction, which is more cost-effective for 
industrial applications. Cut190 is the only  Ca2+-activated 
PET hydrolase. It has inactive and active forms in the 
absence and presence of  Ca2+, respectively (Miyakawa 
et al. 2015). This is due to the absence of an amino acid 
in the β1-β2 loop of Cut190, compared to other enzymes 
(Oda et al. 2018) (Fig. S2). Cut190 has three  Ca2+-binding 
sites: site 2 is a common cation-binding site for cutinases, 
whereas site 1 is required for its unique activation by  Ca2+ 
(Numoto et al. 2018). The crystal structure of IsPETaseW159F 
(PDB ID: 6ILX) is like that of Cut190 (PDB ID: 5NZO), 
particularly in the  Ca2+-binding sites (Liu et al. 2019; Liu 
et al. 2023). Two metal-binding sites have been identified 
on the surface of PHL7, which differs from sites 2 and 3 
of Cut190 and may serve as future mutagenesis targets to 
increase its thermostability, as well as other PET hydrolases 
(Richter et al. 2023).
Substrate‑binding sites
Joo et al. (2018) conducted a molecular docking study of 
IsPETase with 2-hydroxyethyl-(monohydroxyethyl tere-
phthalate) 4 (2-HE(MHET) 4) and identified four substrate-
binding subsites: subsites I, IIa, IIb, and IIc. Kawabata et al. 
(2017) also proposed that amino acids are responsible for 
binding the PET model substrate to Cut190. According to 
their model, the substrate is expected to be in an extended 
form, which differs from the bent form of 2-HE(MHET) 4 
that interacts with IsPETase. The amino acids involved 
in substrate-binding are in subsite I and part of subsite II 
according to this model. The substrate-binding cleft can 
accommodate one or two MHET units. Wei et al. ( 2019b) 
stated that whereas the catalytic triad of IsPETase could 
correctly access the ester bond in 2-HE(MHET) 4 located 
between subsites I and IIa, subsites IIb and IIc were unlikely 
to interact with the other two MHET units, as suggested by 
Joo et al. (2018). Furthermore, Richter et al. (2023) hypoth-
esized that the weak interaction between the aromatic phe-
nylene moieties in PET and the surrounding hydrophobic 
amino acid residues facilitates substrate binding required for 
subsequent enzymatic hydrolysis of PET, rather than the per-
fect accommodation of a specific conformation of a polymer 
segment. They compared the amino acids in subsites I and II 
of type I and II enzymes. The authors suggest that subsite I is 
the primary contributor to binding, interacting with one PET 
moiety to achieve a productive conformation at the catalytic 
serine. In contrast, subsite II mainly contributes to the initial 
substrate binding and guides the PET chain toward the active 
site. Thus, subsite II may act as a guiding channel with loose 
interactions, transferring the new substrate chain produced 
by ester hydrolysis to subsite I. However, more research is 
necessary to confirm this hypothesis.
Subsite I
The amino acid compositions at subsite I were similar for 
type I enzymes (Table 1). The residues His218 and Phe222 
in the LCC were highly conserved. In PHL7 and Cut190, 
Tyr95 of LCC was replaced with Phe; in PHL7, TfCut2 and 
Cut190, Val212 of LCC was replaced with Ile; Phe125 of 
LCC was replaced with Leu in other cutinases; and in Bhr -
PETase, Tyr127 in LCC was replaced with Phe, whereas 
other cutinases have Gln at this position. In Cut190, replac-
ing Gln138 with a small amino acid, Ala, improves activ -
ity by avoiding the atomic clashes of substrates with the 
residue positioned toward the extension of PET as a bar -
rier (Fig. 2A and B) (Oda et al. 2018). Similarly, replacing 
Tyr127 with Gly in LCC improves the activities of  LCCICCG  
and  LCCWCCG , as it is located at the same position as Gln138 
in Cut190 (Tournier et al. 2020) (Fig. 2C).
TfCut2, Cut190, BhrPETase, and PHL7 all have Leu 
at position Phe125 in the LCC (Table  2). According to 
Kawai et al. (2022), the activity of Cut190 increases when 
Leu136 is mutated into Phe. This position is close to Gln138 
(Cut190) and appears to be the exit of the polymer chain. 
Therefore, aromatic amino acids such as Phe may interact 
more with aromatic terephthalic acids than with hydrophobic 
amino acids, such as Leu. Pfaff et al. (2022) modified Leu92 
and Gln94 of PHL7 (now called PES-H1) to Phe and Tyr, 
respectively, at the corresponding positions of Leu136 and 
 Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology (2024) 108:404

Gln138 in Cut190. This modification improved hydrolytic 
activity against amorphous PET films and pretreated PET 
waste, possibly due to the creation of an aromatic channel 
with a known aromatic clamp (Trp155 and Phe62) (Fig. 2D 
and E). It is suggested that Ala/Gly may be a better substitu-
tion for Gln94, as it removes a barrier, and that Phe may be 
better for intensifying the aromatic channel. Table  2 shows 
that His218 and Phe222 in LCC are highly conserved among 
thermophilic PET hydrolases. These two residues are char -
acteristic of type I enzymes. However, in BhrPETase, these 
two amino acids are mutated into Ser and Ile (TurboPETase; 
 BhrPETaseH218S/F222I/A209R/D238K/A251C/A281C/W104L/F243T) (Cui 
et al. 2024). Ser and Ile are the same residues as those in 
IsPETase and appear to weaken the interaction with the aro-
matic polymer, in contrast to those of His and Phe.
Subsite II
Subsite II contains two residues, His164 and Phe243, 
which are characteristic of type I PET hydrolases. 
A single mutation of F243I decreased the T m value 
of LCC, but  LCCICCG  had its T m value increased by 
9.3 °C (94.0 °C). The template for TurboPETase 
 (BhrPETaseH218S/F222I/A209R/D238K/A251C/A281C/W104L/F243T ) is 
BhrPETase, which has a 94% identity with LCC. However, 
it has Thr243 instead of Phe243, which is the same as type 
IIb PbPL (Table  1). A disulfide bond was introduced in 
Ala251 and Ala281, which differs from Asp238 and Ser283, 
respectively, in  LCCICCG . However, both disulfide bonds 
likely played similar roles in TurboPETase and  LCCICCG . 
TurboPETase could break down 200 g/L of pretreated post-
consumer PET bottles at 65 °C for 8 h. The improved perfor-
mance of TurboPETase can be attributed to its PET-binding 
groove (Ser218/ILe222/Thr243/Leu104), which is more 
flexible and allows for more precise targeting of attacks (Cui 
et al. 2024). The Tm value of BhrPETase was 101 °C, which 
is higher than LCC. TurboPETse, in contrast, had a Tm value 
of 84 °C, which is like that of LCC. This is because of the 
replacement of Phe243 with Thr243 (subsite II) and a pair 
of His218 and Phe222 with Ser and Ile (subsite I) (Table 2). 
Higher Tm values result from the greater rigidity of proteins. 
However, maintaining sufficient thermostability while allow-
ing for some flexibility may lead to better performance in 
the hydrolysis of PET. Replacement of Phe243 with Ile or 
Trp in LCC resulted in better performance  (LCCICCG  and 
 LCCWCCG  with T m values of 94.0 °C and 98.0 °C, respec-
tively) than in LCC. The same positive effect of replacing 
Phe with Ile was observed in  ThcCut1AICCG  (Zhang et al. 
2022b). Although the core structure of PET hydrolases is 
similar in both type I and II enzymes, there are differences 
in their sequences, except for important motifs. These differ-
ences may be related to each other and result in recombinant 
Fig. 2  3D structure models of PET hydrolases with a PET dimer. 
PET dimer-bound models were built based on the structure of 
1,4-butnediol diterephthalate (TaBTa) in  LCCICCG-S165A (PDB ID:

(Scheme S1 and Fig. S4). The superimposed TaBTa template mol-
ecules are indicated in white transparent stick models. The PET dimer

expression of genes, integrity of protein structure, thermo-
stability, and activity. PHL7 (PES-H1) is a type I PET hydro-
lase, but it contains Leu (Leu210) at the position of Phe243 
in the LCC. The substitution of Leu with Thr (L210T) 
resulted in significantly higher activity, whereas substitu-
tion with Phe (L210F) decreased activity by approximately 
half (Richter et al. 2023). A similar effect was observed on 
TurboPETase upon replacement with Thr, which enabled 
the enzyme structure to be more flexible. The mutant main-
tains sufficient thermostability for PET hydrolysis, although 
with a slightly lower T m value of approximately 1 °C. The 
substitution of Ile/Leu for Phe and Thr for Ile/Leu at this 
position may be more effective in providing flexibility to 
subsite II by loosening its interaction with PET. Although 
these type I enzymes share core structures, there are sub-
tle differences among them. The findings from LCC, PHL7 
(PES-H1) and TurboPETase suggest that any variants in sub-
sites I and II could cause improved performance, unless the 
core structure of the proteins is destroyed, and the interaction 
of amino acids with PET is well tuned. Pirillo et al. (2023) 
created  LCCS101N/F243T with Tm value of 76.6 °C (lower by 
4.2 °C than LCC), which showed better activity at 55 °C for 
untreated post-consumer PET waste than LCC. The basic 
reaction mechanism of thermophilic enzymes must be a lock 
and key mechanism as described above, but subtle tuning of 
the substrate-binding groove performs better.
Table 2 shows that TfCut2 contains Gly62, whereas other 
type I and type IIa enzymes have Ala at the same position. 
The activity of TfCut2 is inhibited by the hydrolytic prod-
ucts BHET and MHET, but this inhibition is overcome by 
the G102A (G62A without a signal peptide) mutation (Wei 
et al. 2016). Furukawa et al. (2019) also found that the G62A 
mutation, together with the Phe209 mutation (correspond-
ing to Phe243 in LCC), increased the activity of TfCut2. 
 TfCut2F209A, a single mutation, showed improved activity. 
Mrigwani et al. (2023) created a G62A/F209I/E249R mutant 
of TfCut2. Therefore, it is possible to replace Phe with Ile/
Leu, Thr and Ala at this position. However, the effect of Ala 
has not been compared to that of Ile/Leu and Thr. Accord-
ing to Chen et al. (2022), a combination of H184S/Q92G 
(subsite I) and F209I/I213K (subsite II) mutations in T. fusca 
cutinase  (TfCutD204C/E253C ) increased enzyme activity by 
approximately 30-fold. This combined mutation is useful for 
LCC, Est119 and BhrPETase. H184S corresponds to S214 
of IsPETase.  LCCICCG  contains Q92G and F209I mutations. 
However, the Tm values of these mutants have not yet been 
determined, making it difficult to evaluate them using other 
variants of TfCut2, LCC, Est119 and BhrPETase. Further -
more, we could not locate a reference for the original tem-
plate enzyme (Zhu et al. 2021) on the Internet, so we could 
not confirm the details of the strains and template enzymes.
LCCICCG  was further mutated by docking-assisted engineer-
ing (Zheng et al. 2024). The resultant best variant of  LCCICCG  
(LCC-A2:  LCCICCG/H218Y/N248D: Tm value of 95.25 °C, higher 
by 1.11 °C than  LCCICCG ) has the widened substrate chan-
nel between subsite I (H218Y) and subsite II and showed the 
improved ligand interactions near the active center (N248D), 
by which the variant depolymerized > 90% of the pretreated, 
post-consumer PET waste (200 g/kg) within 3.3 h at 78 °C. 
Under the rapid depolymerization process, recrystallization 
might not affect significantly, as the performance of the vari-
ant was better at 78 °C than at 72 °C.
Other sites
Besides the direct substrate-binding sites, the mutation of 
the surface charge was tried for CaPETase having Trp (char-
acteristic of type II enzymes) at the position of His164 in 
LCC (characteristic of type I enzymes). Hong et al. (2023) 
introduced disulfide and hydrogen bonds and modified the 
protein surface charge to create a rationally designed mutant 
(CaPETase M9). CaPETase M9 has a T m value of 83.2 °C 
and displayed more than 90% depolymerization of post-
consumer PET powder (3.75 g/150 mL) at 55 °C in 12 h 
in a pH-stat bioreactor. However, the enzymatic activity at 
60 °C was slightly lower than that of  LCCICCG . Therefore, 
the efficiency might not satisfy the requirement for indus-
trial application. Modification of the protein surface charge 
was also used to mutate the salt-dependent cutinase from 
Thermocarpiscus australiensis (TaC) to salt-free enzymes 
(Brinch-Pedersen et al. 2024).
Li et al. (2022) designed  TfCut2 S121P/D174S/D204P  with 
enhanced thermostability by mining molecular dynamics 
simulation trajectories using machine learning methods. 
Three mutation sites are in outer loop regions. The variant 
had the ΔTm value of 9.3 °C and showed the increased PET 
degradation at 70 °C.
The best performance of engineered thermophilic 
PET hydrolases
Table 2 shows representative thermophilic PET hydrolases 
and their mutants. All variants of these PET hydrolases 
were thermostable above 70 °C for at least 10 h. ThcCut1 
(Tm: 72 °C) was mutated by Zhang et al. (2022b) to the best 
variant  ThcCut1G63A/F210I/D205C/E254C/Q93G   (ThcCut1AICCG ; 
Tm: 92.8 °C), with mutations corresponding to  LCCICCG  
(Tournier et al. 2020) except for the G63A mutation, which 
corresponds to the G62A mutation in TfCut2 (Wei et al. 
2016). The mutant resulted in the degradation of 96.2% of 
post-consumer PET bottle particles in 96 h at 70 °C with 
the addition of dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide. Zeng 
et al. (2022) improved  LCCICCG  by introducing additional 
mutations: KIP (A59K/V63I/N248P), RIP (A59R/V63I/
N248P), and KRP (A59K/V75R/N248P), resulting in higher 
Tm values (approximately 99 °C) compared to  LCCICCG  
Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology (2024) 108:404

(95.2 °C). The optimal temperature for reinforced PET, 
including 30% glass fiber, was 85 °C. However, their activ-
ity against amorphous PET was like that against  LCCICCG . 
In a study by Ding et al. (2023), additional mutations (S32L/
D18T/S98R/T157P/E173Q/N213P) were introduced into 
 LCCICCG   (LCCICCG _16M). The mutant exhibited higher effi-
ciency toward crystalline PET powder at 75 °C and toward 
crystalline PET materials at temperatures between 75 and 
80 °C. The mutant digestion of ground crystalline water bot-
tles produced more soluble products than  LCCICCG  in 24 h 
at 75 and 80 °C, resulting in a degradation level of approxi-
mately 30%. This means the 70% residues and the effect of 
recrystallization is not described. LCC-A2, further mutated 
variant of  LCCICCG  (Zheng et al. 2024), displayed higher 
performance for the pretreated, post-consumer PET waste 
at 78 °C than at 72 °C, showing > 90% depolymerization of 
200 g/kg. Newly cloned Kubu-P was mutated to Kubu-PM12 
(Kubu-PT95R/D230S/E131Q/Q127S/D190HA279S/T119N/V184I ), which 
showed better performance under PET load of 20 and 30% 
PET at 70 °C, compared to  LCCICCG  (Seo et al. 2024). Seo 
et al. (2024) also suggested the production of BHET (21 
mM) by enzymatic glycolysis of PET using Kubu-P M12 in 
ethylene glycol, although the conversion rate is 8% in 48 h 
at 40 °C. BHET is readily hydrolyzable and detectable at 
trace level in the rection mixture of PET with PET hydro-
lases. Production of new materials might be significantly 
in line with upcycling of degradation products from PET 
(Amalia et al. 2024; Satta et al. 2024). Complete enzymatic 
depolymerization of PET produces TPA and ethylene gly -
col, which can be resynthesized to PET to close a loop from 
monomer production to regenerate monomers using PET 
waste (Tournier et al. 2023).
Achieving the 90% conversion required for industrializa-
tion at high temperatures above 70 °C can be challenging 
due to PET recrystallization competing with depolymeriza-
tion (Arnal et al. 2023). Arnal et al. (2023) reported that 
 LCCICCG  performed better at 68 °C than at 72 °C (Tournier 
et al. 2020), achieving 98% conversion of amorphized PET 
within 24 h. Cui et al. (2024) used a computational strategy 
to redesign BhrPETase into TurboPETase, which reduced 
its Tm value from 101 °to 84 °C and acquired the highest 
activity outperforming  LCCICCG . The enzyme displayed 
nearly complete PET depolymerization at 65 °C with 200 
g/kg substrate loading and 2  mgenzyme/gPET in 8hr. Under the 
same conditions,  LCCICCG  completed PET depolymerization 
at 65 °C in 16 h. LCC-A2 displayed the best performance 
at 78 °C, compared to 72 °C and 81 °C (Zheng et al. 2024). 
The enzyme nearly completed depolymerization with 200 g/
kg substrate loading and 0.6  mgenzyme/gPET in 8 h. It remains 
to be fully elucidated which strategy, preventing recrystal-
lization below 68 °C or rapid depolymerization at 78 °C, is 
cost-effective and appropriate. PET hydrolases have not been 
reported for the highly crystalline forms of the polymer, 
especially those found in consumer products (Erickson et al. 
2022; Tournier et al. 2023; Arnal et al. 2023). Amorphiza-
tion is one way to address the recalcitrance of crystalline 
PET to enzymatic attacks.
Engineering of type II enzymes
Type IIa
PET2 is a thermophilic type IIa hydrolase. The wild-type 
enzyme has one disulfide bond at the corresponding posi-
tion of type I enzymes. The T m value of the enzyme was 
increased by 3 °C by introducing an additional disulfide 
bond at the N-terminal position (R42C-G89C), which dif -
fers from the metal-binding site of type I enzymes (Naka-
mura et al. 2021). IsPETase mutants with disulfide bonds 
have been engineered, resulting in increased thermostability 
and activity, as described below. Therefore, introducing a 
disulfide bond at an appropriate position is an effective engi-
neering strategy to enhance the thermostability and activity 
of type I and II enzymes. Multiple single mutations were 
identified that exhibited higher T m or better activity than 
wild-type PET2. These mutations were combined to create 
PET2R47C/G89C/F105R/E110K/S156P/G180A/T297A, 
which demonstrated a 6.7 °C higher T m and three times 
higher activity at 60 °C than the wild-type.
CtPL from C. taiwanensis is a thermophilic type IIa 
enzyme (Chen et al. 2021). CtPLH210S/F214Ile/N181A/F235L , 
expressed in Pichia pastoris (which showed better expres-
sion than in Escherichia coli), was active at 60 °C (Li et al. 
2023). His and Phe in subsite I, which are common to type 
I enzymes, were mutated to Ser and Ile, respectively, as 
found in IsPETase. Furthermore, Phe, which corresponds to 
Phe243 in subsite II of LCC, was mutated to Leu, like PHL7 
(PES-H1). N181A was used to remove N-glycosylation sites 
and restore the hydrolytic activity of PET.
Type IIb
Numerous studies have been conducted on mutational 
enhancements of IsPETase. Initially, the research focused 
on boosting activity at ambient temperature; however, the 
resulting activities were insufficient for industrial depolym-
erization. The enzyme’s thermostability was then targeted, 
as it was discovered that the wild-type enzyme is thermola-
bile and that enzymatic PET depolymerization is tempera-
ture-dependent, as previously stated. Several thermostable 
IsPETases were obtained, as shown in Fig. S2. The first ther-
mostabilization of IsPETase through rational protein engi-
neering was reported by Son et al. ( 2019). IsPETaseS121E/
D186H/R280A  (ThermoPETase) increased the T m value by 
8.81 °C and the activity at 40 °C by 14-fold, compared to 
 Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology (2024) 108:404
404 Page 12 of 18
the wild-type. Cui et al. (2021) improved the robustness of 
IsPETase using a computational strategy (GRAPE). The 
mutant enzyme, DuraPETase (IsPETaseS121E/I168R/
W159H/S188Q/R280A/A180I/G165A/Q119Y/L117F/
T140D), exhibited a T m value of 77 °C, which is 31 °C 
higher than the original value. Furthermore, it demonstrated 
over 300-fold activity toward semicrystalline PET film at 
mild temperatures (37 °C for 10 days). The W159H muta-
tion altered the Try-Ser pair in subsite II, which is typical 
of type IIb enzymes, to His in type I enzymes. The Q119Y/
L117F mutation resulted in a change in the LCC sequence. 
Therefore, DuraPETase appears to have acquired the char -
acteristics of type I enzymes.
The introduction of a disulfide bond at the correspond-
ing metal-binding site in type I enzymes can increase 
the thermostability of Is PETase. For example, Is PETa-
seTM N233C/S282C  ( IsPETase S121E/D186H/R280A/N233C/S282C ) 
exhibits a T m value of 68 °C, which is 23 °C higher than 
the wild-type. This leads to enhanced thermostability 
at temperatures up to 60 °C (Brott et al. 2021). Lu et al. 
(2022a) introduced five mutations in IsPETase by machine 
leaning-aided engineering, designated as FAST-PETase 
(IsPETase N233K/R224Q/S121E/D186H/R280A ), based on predic-
tions and scaffolds from wild-type IsPETase, Thermo-
PETase, and DuraPETase. In 1 week, FAST-PETase almost 
completely degraded untreated post-consumer PET at  
50 °C. HotPETase, which contains 21 mutations compared 
to the wild-type, was also identified. Three mutations were 
derived from the initial protein template, ThermoPETase. 
An additional disulfide bridge was rationally inserted, and 
another 16 mutations were identified by directed evolu-
tion using automated, high-throughput platform (Bell et al. 
2022). The enzyme achieved a T m value of 82.5 °C, which 
is comparable to that of type I enzymes. The enzyme can 
degrade semicrystalline power, milled bottle-grade PET, 
PET/polyethylene composite film, and amorphous PET 
film at 60 °C in 5−24 h (Bell et al. 2022). In the crystal 
structure of wild-type IsPETase, Trp185 was present in three 
conformations, believed to facilitate substrate binding and 
catalysis in wild-type (Han et al. 2017; Chen et al. 2021). 
However, in HotPETase, the residue is present as a single 
conformer, which creates a new π-stacking interaction with 
Tyr214, restricting its conformational freedom. Efficient 
PET decomposition at high temperatures does not require 
flexible Trp185. Arnal et al. (2023) compared the activities 
of HotPETase and FAST-PETase with those of  LCCICCG  and 
PES-H1L92F/Q94Y. The activities of the two IsPETase variants 
were much less than those of the type I enzymes. Cui et al. 
(2024) also indicated the same results as Arnal et al. (2023).
Shi et al. (2023) recently discovered a highly effective 
variant of IsPETase, DepoPETase (IsPETaseN246D/T88I/D220N/
S290P/R260Y/N233K/D186H ) through a novel fluorescence-based 
high-throughput screening. The variant produced 1407-fold 
more products toward the amorphous PET film at 50 °C and 
had a Tm value of 23.3 °C higher than the wild-type. The 
enzyme enabled complete degradation of untreated post-
consumer PET waste (amorphous). DepoPETase exhib-
ited lower activity at 50 °C for 24 h than FAST-PETase, 
but showed higher activity for 48 h. However, based on the 
presented finding, this enzyme may not perform as well as 
type I enzymes.
By combination of three-directional points (protein 
yield, activity and durability), Lee et al. (2023) carefully 
created Z1-PETase (IsPETaseS121E/D186H/N246D/S242T/
N233C-S282C/P181V/A180V/N132E/R224E/A171C-
S193C), which depolymerized > 90% of post-consumer 
PET powders (crystallinity of approximately 10% and a 
concentration of 2.5 %) within 24 and 8 h at 40 and 55 °C, 
respectively. The industrialization of Z1-PETase must be 
dependent on its capability for high loading of PET powder 
such as 20% levels for  LCCICCG  and TurboPETase.
Mutation results indicated that several amino acids are 
key targets for mutation (Fig. S3). S121E/D186H/R280A 
are included in ThermoPETase, HotPETase and FAST-
PETase, but R280A is not in Z1-PETase. R280A and D186H 
are included in DuraPETase and DepoPETase, respec-
tively. D233C/S282C mutation is found in HotPETase and 
Z1-PETase. N233K is found in FAST-PETase and Depo-
PETase. Ser214 is mutated to His and Tyr in DuraPETase 
and HotPETase, respectively. Gln119 is mutated to Tyr and 
Lys in DuraPETase and HotPETase, respectively.
The wild-type IsPETase cannot hydrolyze MHET, 
which is hydrolyzed by MHETase to TPA and ethylene gly-
col (Yoshida et al. 2016). MHETase is a feruloyl esterase 
homolog, which was cloned and characterized (Palm et al. 
2019; Knott et al. 2020). Knott et al. (2020) reported a syn-
ergetic effect of IsPETase and MHETase for PET hydrolysis 
at 30 °C for 96 h. However, MHET is spontaneously hydro-
lyzed at high temperatures (Arnal et al. 2023), resulting in 
that MHET is eventually converted into TPA in enzymatic 
PET hydrolysis during thermophilic enzymes. In addition, 
intensified IsPETase, such as Z1-PETase, can hydrolyze 
MHET even at 30 °C (Lee et al. 2023).
Conclusion and perspective
PET-hydrolyzing enzymes are widely distributed, indicat-
ing that PET, particularly amorphous PET, can be hydro -
lyzed in ecosystems at extremely low rates. However, it 
is important to avoid creating an illusion for the public or 
overestimating its role, as biodegradation in the ecosystem, 
even if possible, cannot match the amount of PET released 
into the environment. The most crucial aspect is to collect 
and recycle PET waste as much as possible. Enzymatic PET 
hydrolysis is a promising technology for ecofriendly PET

recycling. Recent research has demonstrated the feasibil-
ity of industrial PET biorecycling using PET hydrolases. 
Currently, uncountable PET-hydrolyzing enzymes have 
been identified, including type I and type II with varia-
tions. However, none of the wild-type enzymes are suitable 
for industrial applications. To achieve a practical level for 
industrial biorecycling, enzymes have been mutationally 
improved, with PET waste pretreatment. Variants created 
from the representative PET hydrolases and their muta-
tional strategies are listed in Table S4 and S5. Currently, 
no enzyme can meet the requirements for industrialization 
without pretreatment of PET waste, such as amorphization 
and micronization. This is because enzyme efficiency highly 
depends on the ratio of PET dimensions per enzyme, and the 
degradability of crystalline PET is significantly lower than 
amorphous PET. PET waste, including polyolefins, PET, 
and polystyrene, is often discarded as plastic trash without 
being sorted by type, except for transparent water bottles, 
which are collected and recycled. The classification of PET 
waste based on its crystallinity grade, whether amorphous or 
crystalline, is practically impossible. Therefore, biorecycling 
requires a balance between improving enzymes and imple-
menting economical and ecofriendly pretreatments. Some 
enzymes performed better on untreated or crystalline PET 
waste than  LCCICCG , which is still considered as the standard 
PET hydrolase. However, the degradation of crystalline PET 
was much lower than amorphous PET, leaving behind unde-
composed remnants, mostly crystalline parts. PET stored at 
temperatures near Tg undergoes physical aging (Hutchinson 
1995). When post-consumer PET waste was kept at 70 °C, 
its crystallinity gradually increased and reached a threshold 
of 20% for the upper limit of biodegradation in approxi-
mately 10 h (Pfaff et al. 2022). However, after being kept at 
65 °C for 24 h, there was almost no increase in crystallin-
ity (Tournier et al. 2020). The amorphous fraction of PET 
undergoes physical aging at 70 °C, gradually transforming 
into rigid amorphous fraction adjacent to the crystalline 
fraction. This transformation results in limited accessibility 
to enzymatic hydrolysis, as noted by Wei et al. (2019a). The 
reaction temperature of  LCCICCG  was re-optimized from 72 
to 68 °C, possibly due to these risks, as suggested by Arnal 
et al. (2023). TurboPETase displayed better performance at 
65 °C than  LCCICCG  (Cui et al. 2024) on a laboratory scale 
(in a 7.5 L bioreactor). The operational temperature for PET 
hydrolases must be lower than 68 °C. On the other hand, a 
new LCC variant, LCC-A2 suggested the best performance 
at 78 °C in a shorter time than  LCCICCG  and TurboPETase 
(Zheng et al. 2024). Further work is needed to evaluate them 
scientifically and practically. Erickson et al. (2022) used 
bioinformatics and machine learning to identify 74 putative 
thermotolerant PET hydrolases with natural diversity. The 
three candidate enzymes showed higher hydrolysis rates for 
the crystalline powder compared to the amorphous powder 
or film. Furthermore, two of the candidates performed better 
for amorphous films than for amorphous powders. However, 
their optimal temperatures range from 30 to 60 °C and their 
activity levels are lower than those of  LCCICCG  at 70 °C. 
Carbios has announced the industrial use of  LCCICCG  for 
enzymatic recycling (https:// www. carbi os. com/ en/ enzym 
atic- recyc ling/). PET hydrolases that can operate at tempera-
tures lower than 68 °C for shorter than 24 h or PET hydro-
lases that can degrade crystalline PET to the same extent 
as amorphous PET, achieving 98% conversion at 20% PET 
loading, could replace  LCCICCG . TurboPETase and LCC-
A2 outperform  LCCICCG  on a laboratory scale, but their 
involvement in the industrial biorecycling of PET is yet to 
be determined, as the industrialization involves several fac-
tors other than PET hydrolase and requires the total process 
refinement is needed.
Taken together, PET hydrolases applicable to industrial 
depolymerization of PET need enough thermostability close 
to the Tg of PET (below 80 °C) and keep sufficient durability 
and catalytic efficiency of at least 90% (ideally 95%) conver-
sion against amorphous PET (high loading ~ 200 g/L; pref-
erably higher).  LCCICCG  and TurboPETase can be the stand-
ard enzymes used for PET biorecycling. It should be noted 
to use  LCCICCG  or TurboPETase under its optimal condi-
tions (pH 8.0 and 65-68 °C) on testing. In numerous studies, 
the activity of each target enzyme has been compared to that 
of wild-type LCC (even after the publication of  LCCICCG ) 
or  LCCICCG  at lower temperatures, such as 30−50 °C. No 
international scientific consensus has emerged for the evalu-
ation of PET hydrolases (Arnal et al. 2023), which require 
commercially available or voluntarily provided PET powder 
samples for testing, as an amorphous film from Goodfellows 
Cambridge, Ltd. was used as the standard substrate for PET 
hydrolases in the previous stage of research.
The performance of the resultant mutation appears to 
depend on wild-type enzymes. For example, although ther -
mostabilized mutants of IsPETase have been developed, 
they are still unsuitable for industrial use (Arnal et al. 2023; 
Cui et al. 2024). This is likely because PET hydrolases have 
comparable core structures, but differ in their thermosta-
bility and activity levels, which are determined by their 
unique sequences. Thermostabilized mutants of Is PETase 
have been modified with the same amino acids found in type 
I enzymes, such as W159H/L117Y/Q119Y (DuraPETase) 
and a disulfide bond (IsPETaseTM N233C/S282C , and Hot-
PETase), as described above. Positive indexes for improv -
ing type I enzymes include the introduction of an additional 
disulfide bond at the appropriate position, mostly at the 
cation-binding site, to increase thermostability. Changing 
an obstacle amino acid to probable extension of the poly -
mer chain was useful. For example, in Cut190, changing 
Gln138 to Ala and in LCC, changing Tyr127 to Gly were 
effective. However, in PES-H1 L92F/Q94Y, a single mutation 
 Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology (2024) 108:404
404 Page 14 of 18
was attempted by changing Gln94 to Tyr, but it failed. The 
substitution of Leu136 to Phe in Cut 190 and Leu93 to Phe 
in PES-H1L92F/Q94Y (LCC has Phe125 at the same position) 
likely enhanced the interaction between the amino acid and 
the polymer, resulting in a π-π interaction between Phe and 
the aromatic ring of TPA. The combination of L92F and 
Q94Y in PES-H1 L92F/Q94Y may create an aromatic channel 
along with an aromatic clamp (Trp155 and Phe62) (Pfaff  
et al. 2022). It has yet to be confirmed whether the rule 
observed in PES-H1 is applicable to others. However, the 
new findings with PES-H1 and TurboPETase provide clues 
for improved performance. PES-H1 has His130 and Leu210 
in the conserved pair of His and Phe in subsite II of the 
type I enzyme. Replacement of Leu with Phe reduced the 
activity, but replacement with Thr improved the activity 
(Richter et al. 2023). BhrPETase shares a 94% identity with 
LCC and has a pair of His and Phe like LCC. However, its 
efficient mutant, TurboPETase, has a pair of His and Thr 
(Cui et al. 2024).  LCCICCG  contains His and Ile residues 
instead of Phe. Therefore, the conserved amino acids can be 
carefully mutated. Leu/Ile and Thr may lead to a more flex-
ible binding groove than that in the wild-type. TurboPETse 
changed the pair of His218 and F189 at subsite I to Ser and 
Ile, respectively, which are characteristic of IsPETase. This 
change is believed to contribute to a more flexible binding 
groove, along with the Phe243 to Thr mutation at subsite 
II. These changes improve flexibility in subsites I and II, 
which is considered the fourth index. The upcoming research 
stage will concentrate on PET hydrolases that can convert 
higher loadings of PET at lower temperatures, comparable 
to those of  LCCICCG  and TurboPETase (preferably shorter). 
Furthermore, the focus will be on those that work better 
on crystalline PET to minimize the PET pretreatment steps. 
Arnal et al. (2023) suggested that acid-tolerant PET hydro-
lases, which can efficiently depolymerize PET with no (or 
minimal) need for soda for pH regulation, would be useful 
in industrial applications.
The three most efficient templates for PET hydrolase 
(LCC, PES-H1, and BhrPETase) were identified using a 
metagenomic approach. This suggests that a metagenome-
derived enzyme gene is a mixture of multiple genes and is 
considered a mutant.
Müller et al. (2005) discovered the first PET hydro-
lases approximately 20 years ago. Carbios is constructing 
the first plant for the enzymatic depolymerization of PET 
in Longlaville, Grand-Est Region, France. The plant is 
expected to start the first significant deliveries to clients 
using  LCCICCG  in 2026. From the end of 2026, Hündgen 
Entsorgungs GmbH & Co. KG will supply 15kt/year of 
post-consumer PET flakes to the first commercial plant 
(carbi os. com/ en/ enzym atic- recyc ling/). TurboPETase 
(Cui et al. 2024) and LCC-A2 (Zheng et al. 2024) outper -
formed  LCCICCG , but the enzyme must overcome barriers 
of practical application for biorecycling. Further improve-
ment of PET hydrolases would be beneficial for future 
PET biorecycling. The knowledge accumulated regarding 
PET hydrolases is also useful for the biorecycling of other 
polymers.
Now, the main target of biorecycling is transparent 
or colored bottles, which make up around 30% of PET 
products and fibers occupy approximately 60 % (Tournier 
et al. 2023). Packaging films comprising amorphous PET 
occupy the third volume of all PET products. They are 
potential targets for biorecycling, when they are separated 
from other polymer packages such as polyethylene, poly -
propylene, and polystyrene packages. Polyester fibers are 
made of semicrystalline PET, which has a higher crys-
tallinity than bottles. They can be targeted for the biore-
cycling, using the same technology as that for PET bot-
tles. However, fibers are often used in mixed forms with 
other natural or synthetic materials, and garments need 
more complex processes to remove accessories such as 
buttons and fasteners (natural, synthetic, or metal mate -
rials). Polymer-recycling is closely linked to social sys-
tems such as bans, laws, and waste-collection networks, 
thereby not dependent only on technological feasibility. 
However, expansion of the target for the biorecycling must 
contribute to reducing the plastic release into the environ-
ment. Upcycling of degradation products (TPA and eth-
ylene glycol) coupled with biorecycling of PET has been 
tried (Amalia et al. 2024; Satta et al. 2024), but its future 
would depend on technological development and economi-
cal profitability.
PET is unsusceptible to decomposition by UV, unlike 
polyolefins, which are prone to UV-induced decomposi-
tion and become a constituent component of microplastics. 
Nevertheless, PET microplastics occupy approximately half 
of the total microplastic, as they are released in household 
wastewater through polyester fabric laundry (garments, 
carpets, textiles etc.). Detergents contain various enzymes 
(https:// bioso lutio ns. novoz ymes. com/ en/ dish/ insig hts/ artic 
le/ begin ners- guide- enzym es- deter gents). PET hydrolases 
are expected to prevent pilling on the surface of polyester 
fabrics. They might also offer a solution for removing micro-
plastics and microfibers generated through laundry as one of 
the detergent enzymes. This is also an industrial application 
of PET hydrolases. For laundry purpose, PET hydrolases 
might satisfy new requirements, such as working at moder-
ately high temperatures and accomplishing the high decom-
position of pilling and microplastics (far lower concentration 
of PET materials in washings compared to industrial biore-
cycling). Micro- and nanoplastics have far broader surface 
than minimized PET particles for industrial biorecycling, 
which is beneficial to PET hydrolases. Enzymatic removal of 
microplastics and microfibers of PET can be technologically 
possible for municipal wastewater treatment.
