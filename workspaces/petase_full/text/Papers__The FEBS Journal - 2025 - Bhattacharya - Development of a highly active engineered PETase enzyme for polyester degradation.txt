Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) accounts for≈6% of global plastic pro-
duction, contributing considerably to the global solid-waste stream and
environmental plastic pollution. Since the discovery of PET-depolymerizing
enzymes, enzymatic PET recycling has been regarded as a promising
method for plastic disposal, particularly in the context of a circular econ-
omy strategy. However, because the PET-degrading enzymes developed so
far suffer from relatively limited thermostability and low catalytic efﬁ-
ciency, as well as degradation product inhibition, their large-scale industrial
applications are still largely hampered. To overcome these limitations, we
engineered the current PET-hydrolyzing enzyme gold standard [the ICCG
variant of leaf-branch compost cutinase (LCC-ICCG)] usingin silico pro-
tein design methods to develop a PET-hydrolyzing enzyme that features
enhanced thermal stability and PET depolymerization activity. Our mutant,
LCC-ICCG-C09, features a 3.5°C increase in melting temperature relative
to the LCC-ICCG enzyme. Under optimal reaction conditions (68°C), the
engineered enzyme hydrolyzes amorphous PET material into terephthalic
acid (TPA) with a two-fold higher efﬁciency compared to LCC-ICCG.
Owing to its enhanced properties, LCC-ICCG-C09 may be a promising
candidate for future applications in industrial PET recycling processes.

Introduction
Worldwide plastic production reached 390 million met-
ric tons in 2021, of which 90.2% comes from
fossil-based production and only the remaining 9.8%
comes from post-consumer plastic recycling or
bio-based plastics [1]. This massive production and
usage of plastics, along with their very long persistence
in the environment, has led to an extreme global pollu-
tion threat, especially in marine environments[2–5].
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the most abun-
dant synthetic polyester in the environment, has an
average lifetime of 25–50 years and accounts for 6.2%
of the total plastic production[1]. It is widely used in
the production of textile ﬁbers and resins for single-use
beverage bottles and packaging. Polyethylene tere-
phthalate is a thermoplastic polymer that is composed
of terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG)
subunits. Nowadays, PET is, to a large extent,
mechanically recycled, a process that results in a signif-
icant loss of the material’s properties and value [6].
Harsh chemical treatments involving the use of sulfuric
acid at 150°C or carried out under alkaline conditions
in the presence of hazardous chemical catalysts (e.g.,
methyltrioctylammonium bromide) are also used, lead-
ing to the depolymerization of PET into its monomeric
building blocks via ester bonds cleavage. However, the
use of such harsh conditions makes it problematic to
expand this treatment on a large scale.
In 1977, Tokiwa and Suzuki proposed using lipase
enzymes to degrade polymeric materials [7]. Indeed,
enzymes work in mild conditions and can replace haz-
ardous chemicals, a concept known as green chemistry.
The ﬁrst report of an efﬁcient PET hydrolase (from
Thermobiﬁda fusca) was published in 2005 [8]. Since
then, numerous thermally stable PET hydrolases and
their related enzymes from the cutinase group (EC.
3.1.1.74) have been identiﬁed in different organisms
[9–13]. The search for thermostable PET hydrolases is
driven by the fact that PET can be more effectively
hydrolyzed at temperatures close to its glass transition
temperature (≈70–80 °C in air, ≈60–70 °C in water).
Near the glass transition temperature, the polymer
chains become more ﬂexible, enabling PET hydrolases
to function optimally. In 2016, Yoshida et al. [14]
reported on a mesophilic bacterium (Ideonella sakaien-
sis) that can thrive on an amorphous PET ﬁlm as its
primary carbon source already at 30°C, making the
enzyme responsible for PET hydrolysis ( IsPETase)
the best option for PET waste decomposition. This
work spurred a great deal of interest and several
efforts in providing enhancedIsPETase mutants. How-
ever, since IsPETase is heat-labile, the enzyme quickly
loses its activity at temperatures above 40°C. There-
fore, more suitable scaffolds have also been explored,
such as, for instance, the Leaf-branch Compost Cuti-
nase (LCC), a naturally occurring PETase that has
been reported to outperform all other known
PET-degrading enzymes and to present a melting tem-
perature (T
m) of 84.7°C. This enzyme has been notice-
ably engineered in 2020 by Tournieret al. [15] leading
to the so-called ICCG variant (also known as LCC-
ICCG, or ICCG for brevity), which, in two different
accounts, is reported to feature aT
m of 91.7 or 94.0°C
(Table 1).
To the best of our knowledge, this variant is currently
considered to be the gold standard PETase enzyme[16].
Despite its remarkable stability, the sequence space for
even a small enzyme like LCC is astounding (20
293 or
10381 theoretical possible sequences), leaving room to
search for even more stable and active enzymes. Here,
we set out to design improved PETase enzymes starting
from the LCC-ICCG variant and using design strategies
similar to those that we used previously with other clas-
ses of enzymes[17–20]. Our working hypothesis is that
improving the thermal stability would be beneﬁcial for
the PETase enzymatic activity, as observed in notable
examples (IsPETase < LCC < LCC-ICCG). For this
reason, we set out to improve LCC-ICCG thermal sta-
bility, expecting further beneﬁcial effects such as, for
instance, higher expression yield and enhanced enzy-
matic activity.
The ﬁeld of computational design of thermostable
proteins is relatively mature, with several established
available methods that can help to generate a library
of mutants and rank them. The easiest and more

common approach involves the introduction of one or
more disulﬁde bonds, which can rigidify the backbone
of the protein and make it more stable. Other stabili-
zation methods generally aim at extending the intra-
molecular hydrogen bonding network, creating
intermolecular salt-bridges, or providing better packing
of the hydrophobic core (e.g., PROSS) [21]. The
Rosetta Supercharge method is meant to improve
the stability of the protein by making the surface more
hydrophilic, a feature that is usually associated with
more stable proteins[22].
While these methods are fast and have been success-
fully used, most of them use an implicit solvent model
(i.e., the solvent is modeled with a continuum rather
than with explicit atoms) and assume a rigid backbone
(which may limit the long-range structural effects of a
mutation). To overcome these limitations, we included
a further computational ﬁlter based on Molecular
Dynamics simulations in explicit water. By using an
orthogonal method, we aimed at screening and rank-
ing on a common platform the most promising
mutants generated by the methods described above.
Our efforts led to the development of three variants
that feature T
m values higher than current PETases
and, for one of them (LCC-ICCG-C09), further
enhanced catalytic activity on amorphous PET ﬁlms.
Results
In silico design and selection of stabilizing
mutants
Enzyme engineering was initiated using the
LCC-ICCG variant reported by Tournieret al. [15],a
mutant of the wild-type leaf-branch compost cutinase
(LCC) bearing four point substitutions: F243I,
Y127G, S283C, and D238C. The latter two substitu-
tions introduce a second disulﬁde bond, complement-
ing the native C275–C292 bond. In both wild-type and
mutant enzymes, the catalytic site is centered on resi-
due S165. The crystal structure of the inactive S165A
LCC-ICCG variant is available in the Protein Data
Bank (PDB ID: 6THS). Our design strategy followed
established protocols [17–19] beginning with the rever-
sion of residue 165 to the catalytically active serine.
Residues within 5˚A of S165 were excluded from muta-
genesis to preserve active site integrity. Three distinct
computational methods were employed, yielding three
separate series of variants.
The use of the Rosetta Supercharge method [22]
which aimed at increasing the charge on the surface of
the enzyme, led to the identiﬁcation of 1 000 potential
enzyme variants, from which those 10 that featured
the best Rosetta score (which we named C01-C10)
were selected for further analysis. PROSS design[21]
produced 9 variants (P01-P09), and Disulﬁde-by-
Design [23] identiﬁed 125 enzyme variants, from which
we selected the best 10, named X01-X10.
The 29 candidate enzyme variants originating from
the different computational screening methods were
then subject to 1 μs molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations in explicit water and ranked based on their
stability as assessed by RMSF analysis [17]. Our
MD-based ranking led to the selection of six candidate
mutants (C08, C09, P06, P08, X05, X09) for experi-
mental production and characterization (Fig. 1,
Fig. S1 and Table2).
Thermal stability
The six candidate enzymes were expressed in E. coli
and puriﬁed. The ﬁnal yields of all the enzymes were
around 16 mg/C1 L
/C0 1 of bacterial culture (see yield in
Table S1). Wild-type LCC, a naturally occurring
PETase, has a Tm of 84.7 °C. This enzyme has been
previously engineered by Tournieret al. [15] leading to
the LCC-ICCG variant with a reportedTm of 94.0°C
(93.6 °C in our own assessment, a difference that could
be attributed to that fact that, forTm measurements,
Tournier et al. used differential scanning ﬂuorimetry
(DSF), whereas we used circular dichroism (CD)).
Indeed, during the thermal stability assessment of the
enzymes, it became apparent that the determination of
its melting temperature (T
m) via differential scanning
ﬂuorimetry (DSF) was unreliable. Speciﬁcally, the
denaturation curve could not be accurately derived
due to theT
m approaching 100°C, which is the upper
operational limit of the Applied Biosystems 7500
Real-Time PCR System utilized for the DSF measure-
ments. As a result, a complete unfolding transition
(typically indicated by a plateau) could not be
observed for the enzymes within the instrumental con-
straints. To overcome this limitation and enable a con-
sistent comparison across all enzyme variants, we
employed CD spectroscopy. This technique facilitated
the accurate determination of T
m values for all pro-
teins examined in the study. Consequently, we propose
that the discrepancy in the T
m of ICCG reported by
Tournier et al. compared to our ﬁndings likely arises
from the methodological differences between DSF and
CD-based measurements.
After our enzyme design campaign, we tested the
thermal stability of the six engineered variants
(Table 3); we found that the C09 (T
m = 97.1 °C) and
X05 (Tm = 96.9 °C) variants have a higherTm than the
reference LCC-ICCG ( Tm = 93.6 °C). The X09

(Tm = 93.8 °C) variant exhibits similar thermal stability
to LCC-ICCG (Fig. S2). We did not determine the
melting temperature of P06 and P08 due to their negli-
gible enzymatic activity in preliminary experiments,
while for C08 it was not possible to obtain a reliable
ﬁt.
Enzymatic activity
Terephthalic acid (TPA) is one of the major degrada-
tion products of the activity of the enzymes on PET.
This compound can be detected by liquid chromatog-
raphy (HPLC), which allows a precise quantiﬁcation
of product formation. Given the potential absorption
spectra overlaps of the degradation products that will
affect the absorption spectra recording in spectropho-
tometric methods, we chose HPLC for its higher speci-
ﬁcity and precision in quantifying the enzymatic
reaction products as also described in the literature
[24]. To assess enzymatic activity, aliquots of the enzy-
matic reactions were harvested at multiple time points
and analyzed by HPLC for the quantiﬁcation of TPA
production (Fig. 2A). Minor degradation products
(MHET and BHET) were also assessed (Fig.S3). We
used an enzyme concentration of 40 n
M (equivalent to
1.2 μg/C1 mL/C0 1 enzyme in the reaction mixture) and an
amorphous PET ﬁlm of 8.4 mg in a 2 mL microcentri-
fuge tube to evaluate the PET degradation activity of
the different mutants. The enzyme concentration corre-
sponds to ≈0.3 mg
ENZYME/gPET, a ratio lower than the
one reported in the original LCC-ICCG paper
(3 mg
ENZYME/gPET), but in agreement with the range
reported in the literature (0.2 –3m gENZYME/gPET)
[25–28] The experiments were done at 68°C, the tem-
perature at which PET degradation is typically carried
out in bioreactors at an industrial scale to work below

the glass transition temperature of PET (Tg ≈ 70 °C). If
we exclude the ﬁrst few hours, where ICCG performs
better, at 68 °C the mean TPA concentration at the
different time points is signiﬁcantly higher for the C09
mutant than for ICCG up until day 6 (144 h, Fig.2A,
B and Figs S3–S5). Moreover, the speciﬁc activity of
C09 is also signiﬁcantly higher ( ≈2-fold) than that
of the gold standard LCC-ICCG over the same length
of time (Fig. 2C). All other enzymes show similar or
weaker performances compared to LCC-ICCG (X09,
C08, X05). At 68 °C, complete sample degradation
could be observed with C09 already at day 4 (data not
shown), a feature not seen with any of the other
enzymes, including LCC-ICCG. The percentage of
weight loss after 6 days of reactions for all the enzymes
is shown in Fig. 2D and in Fig. S3D. In order to
assess the general functionality of the different PETase
variants, we also tested the esterase activity for the
PETase variants using p-nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA)
as a substrate. The speciﬁc activity against pNPA is
highest for C09 and C08, followed by ICCG and X09.
The mutants X05, P06, and P08 have the lowest spe-
ciﬁc activity (Fig.S6).
Enzyme structure
We determined the crystal structure of C09 to assess
whether the substitutions lead to changes in the struc-
ture of the enzyme. The structure was determined at
1.28 ˚A resolution. We compared the predicted second-
ary structure content based on CD with the experi-
mental results, showing good alignment between the
CD-based prediction and the crystallographic structure
(Table S2). The structural comparison of the C09 vari-
ant with the parent enzymes shows no signiﬁcant
changes in the folding, as observed by the minimal
change in RMSD with respect to the WT (0.257 ˚A)
and to the LCC-ICCG variant (0.152˚A). The position
and orientation of the catalytic triad (D210, H242,
and S265) overlap perfectly with the catalytic triad in
the parent enzymes (Fig. 3A). Although we observe
that increased stability leads to higher enzymatic activ-
ity, a mechanistic explanation of the phenomenon is
elusive. We hypothesize that the increase in stability
provided by the additional surface charges in the C09
variant may help to keep the surface-exposed catalytic
site in place even at high temperatures, such as those
used to test the activity of the enzyme (68°C). Indeed,
all the substitutions introduced in the design process
are found mostly on the surface of the enzyme and
away from the catalytic triad (Fig. 3B; Fig. S7)
and are thus unlikely to affect the activity directly.
Rather, the substitutions may reduce the proportion of
the enzyme that may denature over time, and/or pre-
vent the unfolding of the exposed catalytic triad. The
denaturation (and the consequent loss of activity) is

expected to be negligible only forT < Tm [29]. There-
fore, by increasing theTm to 97.1°C, the denaturation
effects may be signiﬁcantly reduced at the working
temperature (68°C), thus possibly explaining the gain
in activity of the C09 design. The stabilization of the
catalytic triad is conﬁrmed by MD simulations, which
show that at increasing temperatures C09 features a
lower RMSF, in particular near the key catalytic resi-
due H242 (Fig.3C).
Discussion
Despite IsPETase being initially considered a promis-
ing enzyme for PET degradation, multiple studies have
shown that thermophilic PET hydrolases (e.g., LCC),
when operating at temperatures above 65°C, outper-
form mesophilic enzymes in PET biorecycling [30].
Since its publication in 2020, the LCC-ICCG variant
has been considered the state-of-the-art PETase
enzyme. Hence, starting from this variant, we set out
to engineer a novel enzyme with enhanced thermal sta-
bility and enzymatic activity. The resulting LCC-
ICCG-C09 design featured a signiﬁcant improvement
in terms of thermal stability ( T
m = 97.1 °C) with
respect to the gold standard LCC-ICCG ( +3.5 °C).
Under optimal reaction conditions (68°C) and at labo-
ratory scale, the LCC-ICCG-C09 enzyme hydrolyzed
low-crystallinity PET materials into TPA with a 2-fold
higher efﬁciency compared to LCC-ICCG. The LCC-
ICCG-C09 variant may represent a further step
towards PET biorecycling. However, further work will
be needed to test this enzyme in industrially relevant
conditions. The LCC-ICCG-C09 variant could also
provide the basis for further rounds of enzyme
engineering.
Recent studies reported in the literature adopted
similar approaches to ours, introducing substitutions
to the LCC-ICCG enzyme to boost its performance
and reporting different degrees of success[26,28,31,32]

comparison of enzymatic performances is challenging
due to the numerous variables involved in the experi-
mental settings (PET crystallinity, PET form, PET
concentration, enzyme concentration, temperature, salt
type and concentration, pH, etc.). In this light, only a
direct comparison with a recognized gold standard in
the same experimental conditions can provide reliable
information.
Fig. 3.Structural comparison of relevant PETase enzymes: wild-type LCC (green), ICCG variant (cyan), and C09 variant (pink). The overall
structural alignment shows no signiﬁcant differences between the enzymes, including the position and the orientation of the catalytic triad
(A). Panel B shows the position of mutations (sticks) in ICCG (cyan) and C09 (pink) with respect to the catalytic site (pink sticks). Panel C
shows a comparison between the Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF) of LCC, LCC-ICCG, and C09 at different temperatures (310, 350,
and 400 K). The RMSF proﬁles show that the mutations (indicated with an asterisk) introduced in the C09 variant reduce the structural
ﬂuctuations of the enzyme, in particular near the catalytic residue H242 (red arrows). Figures in panel A and B are generated with the
software PyMol [51].

Although the ﬁeld of PETase engineering is very
dynamic and is providing highly optimized enzymes,
several issues still need to be thoroughly investigated
to improve enzymatic PET degradation [34]. One of
the major challenges is related to the economic viabil-
ity of enzymatic degradation. Another challenge, more
directly related to protein engineering, concerns the
acidiﬁcation of the medium due to the release of TPA,
which reduces the performance of the PETase enzymes
known to date. Hence, possible directions for enzyme
engineering research could be directed towards the
design of acid-tolerant PETase enzymes. Finally, while
our study primarily compares newly developed
enzymes with the current gold standard in a laboratory
setting, we recognize the need for industrial-scale vali-
dation, such as testing with post-consumer PET in
bioreactors.
Materials and methods
In silico design and selection of stabilizing
mutants
We started our enzyme engineering process from the
LCC-ICCG enzyme reported by Tournieret al. [15]. This
engineered enzyme is a mutant of the wild-type leaf-branch
compost cutinase (LCC) carrying 4 point mutations: F243I,
Y127G, S283C, and D238C. The last two substitutions are
designed to induce the formation of a second disulﬁde
bond, in addition to the native one (C275-C292). In both
enzymes, the catalytic site is centered on residue S165. The
structure of the LCC-ICCG engineered enzyme is available
in the Protein Data Bank (PDB code:6THS) as the inacti-
vated S165A variant.
In our design strategy, we applied protocols used in pre-
vious works [17–19] starting from the LCC-ICCG mutant
structure after reverting amino acid 165 from Alanine to
the catalytically active Serine. All residues within a distance
of 5 ˚A from S165 were excluded from the design and were
therefore left unchanged. The design was done using three
separate methods, resulting in three different series of
variants.
The ﬁrst design strategy (C-series) was performed using
the Rosetta Supercharge tool[22]. This tool was employed
to reengineer the protein surface with amino acids that pre-
sent a high net charge, which is reported to prevent aggre-
gation of partially unfolded states. The design produced
1024 enzyme variants, and the best 10 based on the internal
score were kept for further ranking. The Rosetta Super-
charge tool directly provides a 3D model in PDB format
for the proposed mutants.
In the second design strategy (P-series) we used the
PROSS web server [21] to generate 9 different enzyme
designs with improved packing, hydrogen bond networks,
and salt bridge networks. PROSS directly provided the
PDB structure of the proposed variants.
The third design strategy (X-series) employed the
Disulﬁde-by-Design web server [23] a tool for disulﬁde
bond prediction that allows ﬁnding pairs of amino acids
that can carry cysteine substitutions in the correct orienta-
tion to form disulﬁdes. A total of 150 pair substitutions
were generated and, based on the internal scoring system,
the best 10 of them were retained for further testing. In this
case, we used the “Mutate Residue” tool in VMD to mod-
ify the proposed positions to cysteines.
Overall, our design campaign produced 29 different
enzyme variants that were then evaluated using MD simu-
lations; then ranked according to the method described in
previous works [17–20] Brieﬂy, we solvated each molecular
model with a 15˚A pad of TIP3P water, and we introduced
counter ions to neutralize the system charge, resulting in a
ﬁnal simulation box of ≈30.000 atoms. Hydrogen mass
repartitioning was applied to allow a time step of 4 fs[35].
The systems were subjected to 1000 energy minimization
steps, and it equilibrated for 1 ns at a pressure of 1 atm and
at a temperature of 300 K with NAMD software[36] using
AMBER19SB force ﬁeld [37] non-bonded cutoff of 12 ˚A,
rigid bonds, and particle-mesh Ewald long-range electro-
statics. During the equilibration simulation, the Cα atoms
of the protein were restrained by a 10 kcal /C1 mol
/C0 1/C1 ˚A/C0 2
spring constant. The 1μs production runs were performed
using a NVT ensemble whereby all the parameters (non-
bonded cutoff, and PME) were the same as in the equili-
bration phase. All simulations were run in triplicates. Root
mean square deviations (RMSD) were monitored after each
MD run to assess structural convergence, while root mean
square ﬂuctuations (RMSF) were calculated to assess the
improved stability of the design. As a result, the two best
structures from each design series were selected, namely
design LCC-ICCG-C08, LCC-ICCG-C09, LCC-ICCG-P06,
LCC-ICCG-P08, LCC-ICCG-X05, LCC-ICCG-X09. In the
remainder of this document, the “LCC-IGGC-” preﬁx of
enzyme names is omitted for brevity.
Protein expression and puriﬁcation
The different codon-optimized nucleotide sequences of the
designed PETase mutants were cloned in a pET26b(+) bacte-
rial expression vector (Novagen, Malvern, Worcestershire,
UK), together with a C-terminal 6His-tag. All the different
mutants were transformed and expressed inEscherichia coli
BL21 Star (DE3) cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). A
sample of 4 mL of an overnight culture of the selected strain
grown in the presence of 50μg/C1 mL
/C0 1 kanamycin was inocu-
lated into 2 L of Luria–Bertani broth (LB) at 37°C, supple-
mented with 50 mg /C1 L/C0 1 kanamycin and grown until
OD600 =0.6. The expression was induced with isopropyl 1-
thio-β-D-galactopyranoside (IPTG) at a ﬁnal concentration of
0.1 mM followed by overnight incubation at 18 °Ca n d

220 rpm. Cells were collected by centrifugation and resus-
pended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM
NaCl) supplemented with 0.2 mM protease phenylmethylsulfo-
nyl ﬂuoride (PMSF) and DNAse and then lysed by sonica-
tion on ice. After centrifugation (45 000g for 40 min at 4°C),
the soluble fraction of the cell lysate was passed through a
0.45μmﬁ l t e ra n dt h e nl o a d e do n t oaH i s T r a pH P5 m L( G E
Healthcare, Chicago, IL, USA) column equilibrated with
buffer A (20 m
M Tris/HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM Nacl and 10 mM
imidazole). The Ni afﬁnity column was washed using 10 col-
umn volumes of buffer A. Before elution, ﬁve column vol-
umes (CV) of buffer A supplemented with 50 m
M imidazole
were used to remove unspeciﬁc proteins from the resin. Then,
the bound His-tagged enzyme was eluted with the same
buffer supplemented with 500 m
M imidazole in a linear gradi-
ent. The protein eluted completely with 250 mM imidazole.
The eluted fraction was loaded onto a PD-10 desalting col-
umn pre-equilibrated with buffer C (20 m
M Tris/HCl pH 8.0,
300 mM NaCl) for buffer exchange. Buffer exchange was per-
formed simultaneously after the protein was puriﬁed. The
desired protein was concentrated to≈2m g/C1 mL
/C0 1 using an
Amicon 20 centrifugal ﬁlter with a molecular cutoff of 10
kDa and stored at /C0 80 °C. Protein concentration was
assessed using a NanoDrop OneC (Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc,
Waltham, MA, USA). Sample purity was evaluated by 12%
SDS/PAGE. The ﬁnal yields of all the enzymes were around
16 mg/C1 L
/C0 1 of bacterial culture.
Circular dichroism
Circular dichroism (CD) measurements were performed on
a Jasco J-1500 spectropolarimeter at 20°C. CD was per-
formed to detect the secondary structure of different vari-
ants and to measure the thermostability of the enzyme. The
spectra were determined with the following parameters:
continuous scanning mode with a scanning speed of
50 nm/C1 min
/C0 1, band width 0.1 nm, data pitch 0.1 nm at
20 °C. A 1.0 mm path length quartz cuvette was used for
5 μM samples of different enzymes in 20 mM Tris/HCl pH
8.0, 150 mM NaCl. Thermal denaturation curves were mea-
sured in 1.0 mm path length cuvettes closed with a paraﬁlm
on protein solutions. Protein denaturation was induced
upon increasing the temperature at a rate of 1 °C/C1 min
/C0 1
from 20 °C to 120 °C. The ellipticity at 222 nm was
recorded at intervals of 0.2°C using a 1-nm bandwidth and
a response of 10 s.
The determination of the midpoints of the thermal dena-
turation curves (Tm) was done by ﬁtting the data to a sigmoi-
dal transition curve using a modiﬁed sigmoidal model[38]:
CD = b /C1 T/C0 cðÞ /C0 d /C1 T/C0 eðÞ
1 þ T
a
/C0/C1f/C16/C17
þ d /C1 T/C0 eðÞ
(1)
where T is the temperature, a represents the melting tem-
perature ( Tm), and the terms ( b/C1 T /C0 c) and ( d/C1 T /C0 e)
account for baseline drift at low and high temperatures,
respectively. The parameter f controls the steepness of the
transition. This model allows for accurate ﬁtting of CD
(circular dichroism) data across the full thermal range, cap-
turing both transition and baseline behavior (Fig.S2).
The secondary structures of all the different variants
were measured at 200–250 nm wavelengths and 20°C. Ellip-
ticity was plotted versus wavelength with GraphPad Prism
10 software. Each recorded spectrum was the average of
three scans (Figs S8, S9). CD spectra for the C09 variant
were further analyzed using the K2D algorithm of the
DichroWeb tool[39] (Table S2).
Enzymatic reaction
Bis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (BHET), mono(hydroxyethyl)
terephthalate (MHET), terephthalic acid (TPA), and ethylene
glycol (EG) are the major depolymerization products of the
activity of the enzymes on PET. These compounds can be
separated efﬁciently on a C18 reversed-phase high-
performance liquid chromatography HPLC column, thus
allowing a precise quantiﬁcation of product formation. All
enzyme reactions were performed at a concentration of
40 n
M at 68°C in quintuplicates in 2.0 mL microcentrifuge
tubes in the reaction buffer (500 mM Tris/HCl pH 8.0,
300 mM NaCl). Amorphous, 250μm-thick PET ﬁlms (prod-
uct number ES301445/11) were purchased from Goodfellow
USA and cut into 6 mm diameter circular pellets using a hole
puncher. Individual pellets, whose weight was around 8.4 mg,
were then placed in 2 mL microcentrifuge tubes. The esterase
activity of enzyme variants was assessed by monitoring the
hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl acetate (pNPA)[24]. Reactions
were performed at a concentration of 0.1–1.0 μ
M in a 96-well
microplate at 25°C using 1 mM pNPA in a buffer containing
20 mM Tris/HCl (pH 8.0) and 300 mM NaCl. Enzymatic
activity was quantiﬁed by measuring the increase in absor-
bance at 405 nm (Clariostar Plus), corresponding to the for-
mation of p-nitrophenolate ( ε₄₀₅ = 11.6 m
M/C0 1/C1 cm/C0 1) (see
Fig. S6).
Reversed-phase liquid chromatography
The different compounds produced by PET hydrolytic
enzymes (TPA, as well as BHET and MHET) were quanti-
ﬁed by reversed-phase HPLC (TablesS3–S5). HPLC ana-
lyses were performed on a Shimadzu LC-2030C 3D Plus
system equipped with a PDA detector, a column oven, and
an autosampler (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Separations
were carried out using a Kinetex C18 column (2.7 μm;
4.6 × 150 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA). Column
temperature was maintained at 40°C with a ﬂow rate of
1m L/C1 min
/C0 1. For the mobile phase, 0.1% H3PO4 (solvent
A) and MeCN (solvent B) were used. The linear gradient
mode used for the elution was as follows: 0 min, 10% B;
0–15 min, 10–40% B; 15 –18 min, 40–65% B; 18 –20 min,

65% B; 20–23 min, 65–10% B; 23–25 min, 10% B. At every
time interval, 100μL of the sample was collected from the
reaction vial placed at the set temperature. The 0–72 h sam-
ples were diluted 21 times (50μL of the provided sample
was transferred to autosampler vial and diluted in 1 mL of
10% MeCN +0.1% H
3PO4), whereas the 96 h and 144 h
samples were diluted 101 times (10μL of the provided sam-
ple was transferred to autosampler vial and diluted in 1 mL
of 10% MeCN +0.1% H
3PO4). Detection was accom-
plished via measurement of UV adsorption at 240 nm;
20 μL of each sample was injected into the system, and the
degradation products were quantiﬁed against standard cali-
bration curves ranged 0.1, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0, 50.0 (for TPA and
MHET) and 0.09, 0.9, 4.4, and 43.9 (for BHET)μg/C1 mL
/C0 1.
Protein crystallization
Crystals of the C09 mutant were grown at room tempera-
ture using the vapor diffusion method by mixing a 2μL
drop of a 10 mg/C1 mL/C0 1 protein sample with a 2μL drop of
a solution containing 0.1 M Sodium citrate tribasic dihy-
drate pH 5.6, 20% v/v 2-Propanol, 20% w/v Polyethylene
glycol 4000. Crystals, which appeared after one week, were
frozen in liquid nitrogen using 25% (v/v) glycerol as a
cryoprotectant prior to X-ray diffraction data collection.
Structure determination and reﬁnement
For the structure of the C09 mutant, the initial phases were
obtained by molecular replacement using Phaser [40] and
the atomic coordinates of the crystal structure of a Leaf-
branch compost bacterial cutinase homolog (PDB entry
4EB0) as a search model. Reﬁnement was performed by
alternating rounds of REFMAC5 [41] and manual adjust-
ments in Coot[42] Water molecules were added both man-
ually and automatically using the Coot_reﬁne tool from the
CCP4 package [43] The crystallographic table is shown in
the SI ﬁle in TableS6.
