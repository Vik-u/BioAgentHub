ABSTRACT
Enzymatic and microbial depolymerization of plastic is emerging as a promising method for recycling plastics. This paper looks
into the effects of household and laboratory contamination on waste plastic and the implications these have on the enzymatic
degradation of PET. Specifically, we find that exogenous protein, whether initially contaminating the surface of the plastic
substrate or present in the enzymatic hydrolysis reaction buffer, can substantially inhibit the degradation of PET. The degree of
inhibition varied based on the type of protein as well as the type of PET hydrolyzing enzyme used. Several wash solutions were
applied after surface fouling and shown to improve degradation and in some cases, restoring levels to that of unfouled plastics.
Collectively, these findings can enable a better understanding of factors that influence enzymatic depolymerization including
industrial pre‐processing as well as have implications for in situ degradation.
1 | Introduction
Plastic waste and pollution are endemic issues driven by the low
cost, ease of production, and many desirable properties of
plastics. In 2023 alone, over 413 million metric tons of plastic
were produced (Plastics Europe 2024) with all projections
pointing toward a continued increase. Of these plastics, nearly
half are single‐use including items such as plastic bags, water
bottles, and most packaging (Nguyen et al.2022). The collective
effect of production, use, and disposal of this plastic is docu-
mented in the prevalence of macro‐, micro‐, and nanoplastics in
the built and natural environment as well as the emissions from
their production and the release of chemical additives in the
environment (Iroegbu et al.2021; Li et al.2023). The disposal of
these consumer‐based plastics is also likely to be co‐mingled
with other waste streams and residues, especially food since the
bulk of single use plastics are food adjacent.
Single‐use plastics are not just limited to consumer products but
are also prevalent across many industries. In the medical sector,
single‐use plastics are crucial and unavoidable, for both main-
taining sterility and preventing the spread of illnesses. In the
biologics and pharmaceuticals industry, plastics in the form of
single‐use bioreactors can increase efficiency and lower water
and electricity demands (Andrew Sinclair et al.2008). In the
industrial and academic research setting, single‐use plastics are
utilized in large quantities in products ranging from pipette tips
to petri dishes and sample tubes. For the case of these industrial
and lab plastics, these products will likely be contaminated with
some form of chemical and/or biological residues impacting
disposal (and potentially degradation) considerations.
The fate of these plastics can vary from recycling, landfilling,
and incineration, to mismanagement. In 2023, less than 10% of
plastics worldwide were recycled, with the most common

approach being mechanical recycling (Plastics Europe 2024).
Mechanical recycling creates circularity in the plastics econ-
omy, but a product made from recycled plastic is not adequate
for all uses, especially for those used to package foods
(Woldemar d'Ambrières2019). An emerging method for plastic
recycling is the use of biological depolymerization. The two
main modes of biological plastic degradation are whole cell, and
enzyme‐based systems, which both have interesting and distinct
possibilities (Bergeson et al.2024). An enzymatic approach is
currently being demonstrated at the pilot scale for polyethylene
terephthalate (PET) recycling (Carbios2024). Ongoing studies
are promising in finding similar enzyme systems for additional
plastics (Acosta and Alper2023). This alternative is a promising
addition to current recycling owing to the ability to recover fully
depolymerized monomers that can be reformed into recycled
plastic with property traits similar to virgin plastics.
As the scale of biological PET recycling increases to match the
scale of production, many issues will need to be addressed to
increase efficiency and economic viability (Singh et al.2021;
Uekert et al. 2022). One of these issues is the water usage
associated with enzymatic depolymerization, which is three
times higher than creating virgin PET (Uekert et al.2022). This
water usage does not even account for the water needed to wash
the plastic flakes coming into the process (Singh et al.2021).
The input plastic quality is thus an important factor and can be
quite variable depending on the source. Thus, understanding
the impacts of possible household and industrial contaminants
throughout the use, disposal, and aggregation process on the
degradability of plastics such as PET is critical for considering
the scale‐up of this process. The implications of these findings
also translate to understanding in situ, environmental remedi-
ation wherein the conditions of terrestrial and marine plastic
degradation can be markedly distinct.
In this study, we investigate the effects of household and lab-
oratory contamination on PET enzymatic hydrolysis. A
decrease in plastic degradation was observed when exogenous
protein is used to foul the plastic surface or is added directly
into the hydrolysis buffer. We further test several wash condi-
tions to mitigate or reverse the effects of surface fouling using
various protein contaminants. Additionally, an image analysis
was performed using green fluorescent protein (GFP) to illus-
trate the surface fouling effect and wash benefits. We find that
the decrease in PET degradation is impacted by the specific
fouling protein used, its concentration, and hydrolytic enzyme.
Moreover, we find that the subsequent restoration of degrada-
tion is affected by the wash condition.
2 | Materials and Methods
2.1 | Plasmid Construction and Protein
Production
FAST‐PETase, a PET hydrolyzing enzyme (PHE), was extra-
cellularly produced from a previously constructed pMMB67EH
vector and hosted in Pseudomonas putida KT2440 (Lu
et al.2022). GuaPA, another PHE, was produced intracellularly
from Escherichia coliBL21 (DE3) in a pET‐28b plasmid (Acosta
et al. 2025). GFP was amplified via polymerase chain reaction,
during which a hexa‐histidine tag was added, from a previously
constructed plasmid (Tang et al.2020). The amplified GFP gene
was inserted into a modified pET‐28b plasmid using a Gibson
assembly, transformed and verified in E. coli DH10β. Once
verified the GFP plasmid was transformed into E. coli BL21
(DE3) for production.
For both intracellularly and extracellularly expressed proteins a
single colony containing the plasmid with the desired protein
gene was picked and used to inoculate 3 mL of Luria Bertani
(LB) medium with 50 µg/mL kanamycin or 25 µg/mL ampicillin
and was grown overnight at 37°C/225 rpm. The overnight cul-
ture was then used to inoculate 250 mL of LB medium with
50 µg/mL kanamycin or 25 µg/mL ampicillin at a 1000× dilu-
tion in a 1000 mL flask. The flask scale culture was grown at
37°C/225 rpm until the optical density (OD
600) reached 0.8 for
P. putida KT2440 or OD600 of 0.6 for E. coli BL21 (DE3) and
then protein production was induced by addition of isopropyl‐β‐
D‐1‐thiogalactopyranoside with a final concentration of 0.2 mM.
Protein purification and verification via SDS‐PAGE methods
from Wang et al. were used (Wang et al.2025). The additional
proteins used, hen egg white lysozyme, bovine serum albumin
(BSA), andcandida antarcticalipase B (CalB), were purchased.
Heat‐denatured versions of proteins were created by taking
1 mL of a previously quantified protein and heating it in a water
bath at 95°C for 10 min.
2.2 | Fouled Plastic and Protein Addition
Degradation Assays
Various contaminating solutions were used to foul the plastic
surface. Deionized (DI) water, phosphate buffered saline (PBS),
sterilized LB medium, sterilized yeast extract peptone dextrose
(YPD) medium, RPMI 1640 medium, and soybean oil were used
directly. The simple syrup solution was made by heating equal
volumes of water and household sugar just till dissolved. The
bacterial cell culture was an overnight culture of P. putida
KT2440 grown in LB medium. The yeast culture was an over-
night culture ofSaccharomyces cerevisiae S288C grown in YPD
medium. The mammalian cell culture was a sample of Jurkat
cells in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10 v/v fetal
bovine serum (FBS). The concentrations of FBS were based on
volume percentages of the serum in DI water. The BSA con-
centrations were volume percentages of lyophilized serum in DI
water. To determine the protein concentration for GFP, a
Bradford assay was done on the 1, 5, 10 v/v FBS solutions, and
the amount of GFP was calculated to match the corresponding
FBS concentrations.
Low crystallinity PET purchased from Goodfellow was used for
all assays unless it is noted that a post‐consumer plastic was
used. The post‐consumer plastic used in this study came from a
spinach clamshell container from a local grocery store. For
every fouling condition, 6 mm disks of plastic were placed in a
50 mL conical tube with 10 mL of fouling solution (as described
above). The tubes containing PET disks (either post‐consumer
or purchased Goodfellow substrate) were then placed in an
incubator at 23°C/225 rpm. for approximately 24 h. After 24 h
the plastics were either added directly to a degradation assay or
treated with the various wash conditions. PET disks that were
3091
washed, were washed in clean 100 mL beakers containing 5 mL
of the wash solution and vortexed using a Vortex ‐Genie 2
(Scientific Industries Inc.) for 30 s on high and then washed
a second time using water to remove the wash solution. Once
washed the disks were added to a degradation assay. Wash
buffers included DI water, 10 mM tris‐NaOH buffer (pH 10),
100 mM glycine‐HCl buffer (pH 3), 100 mM acetate buffer
(pH 4.5), and 2 w/v SDS. The pH of the buffers was adjusted to
within 0.05 using 1 M HCl or 1 M NaOH.
Degradation assays used 200 nM of either FAST‐PETase or
GuaPA in 600 µl of 100 mM KH
2PO4‐NaOH buffer (pH 8)
containing a single 6 mm plastic disk (either post‐consumer or
purchased Goodfellow substrate). These degradation assays
were done in either 15 mL conical tubes with screw caps or in
96 deep well plates covered with a well‐fitting plastic mat.
Degradation assays were incubated at 50°C for FAST‐PETase or
60°C for GuaPA for 24 h. For assays with additional contami-
nating protein, the protein was added to the reaction buffer
based on quantification done via a Bradford assay before the
tubes or well block being placed in the incubator. Assays were
then processed for high performance liquid chromatography
(HPLC) quantification.
2.3 | HPLC Quantification
HPLC was used to quantify the PET monomers terephthalic
acid (TPA) and 2 ‐hydroxyethyl terephthalic acid (MHET)
released during PET degradation. Samples were first filtered
using a 0.2 µm filter and then were thoroughly mixed in a 1:1
ration of aqueous sample to dimethyl sulfoxide to improve TPA
and MHET solubility. The HPLC method from Wang et al. was
used (Wang et al.2025).
2.4 | Enzyme Imaging, Quantification of Image
Intensity, and Surface Area
Imaging of GFP‐fouled PET, PE, and PLA squares was done
using 2 ×2 cm2 squares of plastic which had undergone the
same method of fouling as described above. The plastics were
imaged in a GelDoc Go Imaging System (Bio‐Rad Laboratories
Inc.) using the blue tray and the GelGreen settings. The fluo-
rescence intensity was then quantified using Bio‐Rad Image Lab
software. Once the image was uploaded to the software, in the
volume tools tab, using the rectangle volume tool, an inner
square of the same size was selected for each plastic square,
making sure not to select the outer edge of the plastic. The
intensity measurements were then populated using global
background subtraction.
Surface area coverage of GFP was determined using ImageJ
software to analyze the images obtained from the GelDoc Go
Imaging System. In ImageJ, an inner square of the same size
was selected for each plastic square. The maximum intensity
value was measured for the no protein controls and was used as
the threshold value for each wash group. With the threshold
value set for each group, the percent of the surface area over the
threshold value was measured.
3 | Results and Discussion
3.1 | Protein ‐Containing Contaminants Influence
Enzymatic Depolymerization of PET
As suggested above, plastics (including PET) are exposed to a
wide range of chemical, biological, and inorganic contaminants
throughout the linear production‐use‐disposal cycle. The feed-
stocks for plastic recycling are likely to include many used/
discarded plastics that are disposed and collected without
washing, thus impacting the cost of preprocessing. Here, we
sought to investigate how a range of potential consumer and
biological contaminants can impact the enzymatic recycling
potential of PET. To do so, we tested the impact across a variety
of potential contaminants including cooking oil, and sugar, as
well as various unused growth media formulations and different
microorganism cultures.
In the initial degradation inhibition assay, we used a post‐
consumer plastic (crystallinity < 3%) as the plastic substrate.
After incubation with the potential contaminants, and DI water
as a control, we observed that many of these treatments can
reduce enzymatic degradation efficacy as measured by a
reduction in the monomers being released. Specifically, a sig-
nificant decrease (p < 0.05) in monomer release was seen across
all of the cell cultures including the bacterial culture
(p = 0.0016), yeast culture (p = 0.0194), mammalian culture
(p = 0.0015) along with the unused RPMI 1640 medium
(p = 0.0015) and simple syrup (p = 0.0483) when compared to
the water condition (Figure1a). Among these effects, the most
striking decreases came for the mammalian cell culture com-
ponents (both raw media and cell culture), thus indicating
something particularly inhibitory in these solutions.
After observing that even fresh RPMI 1640 medium decreased
monomer release, individual components were tested in the
same fashion. RPMI 1640 is a common medium used to culture
mammalian cells, which is often supplemented with either 10%
bovine serum albumin (BSA) or fetal bovine serum (FBS). Thus,
we next tested PET monomer release using the same post‐
consumer PET substrate with three distinct contaminating
solutions: RPMI 1640 medium without supplemented protein,
10 w/v BSA in DI water, and 10 v/v FBS in DI water. Through
this assay (Figure1b), we observe a greater than 30x decrease in
the monomer being released between the RPMI 1640 media and
the supplemented protein concentrations, thus implicating that
this supplemented BSA/FBS protein in full RMPI culture media
was responsible for the observed decrease in Figure1a. More-
over, this finding suggests that protein produced/secreted dur-
ing bacterial and yeast culture fermentation is likewise the
cause of the observed inhibition of biodegradation.
Intrigued by the implications of protein‐based fouling, we next
sought to identify if this inhibition was also observed with
exogenous protein in the reaction buffer. To gain a more
complete understanding of protein ‐based inhibition of PET
hydrolyzing reactions, we tested whether or not additional
proteins in the reaction buffer would produce a similar inhibi-
tory effect to those seen when the plastic surface had been pre‐
contaminated. For these experiments, we used three readily
available proteins in both their natural and denatured states on
3092 Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 2025
a model Goodfellow brand plastic (crystallinity ~8%). For all six
conditions (3 proteins, denatured and native), addition of extra
protein to the reaction buffer progressively decreased and then
totally inhibited PET degradation. (Figure2a–c). The concen-
tration for complete inhibition differed across each of the
proteins and even between the denatured and native versions of
the same protein.
As illustrations of the trends described above, for the hen egg
white lysozyme, addition of only 500 nM of the native protein

FIGURE 2 | Native and denatured protein decrease monomer release. The impact of exogenous proteins added to the reaction buffer were tested

native and denatured (denoted with D) form, caused an inhibition of degradation efficiency, but at various quantities of added protein. Statistical
analyses were determined using a two‐tailed t‐test with equal variance comparing the 0 nM protein control to the various added protein conditions.

completely inhibits FAST‐PETase whereas complete inhibition
is not observed until 2000 nM of the denatured protein has been
added. In the case of BSA, both the native and denatured ver-
sion show a similar impact on FAST‐PETase activity with a
rather precipitous drop only after 1500 nM of added protein. For
candida antarctica lipase B (CalB), the addition of 200 nM of
native protein can significantly reduce the quantity of mono-
mers being released with a less inhibitory effect by a denatured
version. Moreover, of the three proteins tested, CalB had the
greatest impact at the lowest concentration. These overall dif-
ferences in the reaction inhibition could be due to changes in
the charge state of the protein in its native and denatured state
which would alter the interactions between the PET hydrolyz-
ing enzyme (PHE), the additional protein, and the plastic sur-
face. Additionally similar trends are seen when additional
FAST‐PETase is added to the reaction buffer, where increasing
monomer release is seen with increasing enzyme concentration
to the optimal concentration of 200 nM and after that decreas-
ing monomer release is observed (Lu et al.2022).
3.2 | Surface Contamination Can be Mitigated
Through Washing
To address and mitigate the impact of surface‐level protein
contamination, the efficacy of various wash conditions was
tested. The tested wash conditions were chosen to represent a
range of pHs as well as a surfactant option along with DI water.
The wash conditions were tested on a Goodfellow plastic sub-
strate that were pre‐incubated with two concentrations (1 w/v
and 5 w/v) of BSA as well as DI water (0 w/v BSA) as a control.
Similar to the results seen Figure1b, the incubations with these
levels of BSA result in a near complete inhibition of degradation
activity for the no wash condition (Figure3). In contrast, every
wash condition tested here showed a significant reversion of
activity (p = 0.0014 andp = 0.0006) when compared with the
no‐wash control for both the 1 w/v and 5 w/v BSA conditions.
Based on degradation efficiency, the wash steps were effective,
but with slightly diminishing returns for the higher initial BSA
loading. Moreover, both of the acidic wash conditions resulted
in slightly lower average monomer release whereas the basic
Tris‐NaOH wash and more neutral DI water wash resulted in
higher average monomer release indicating a potential impact
of pH on effectiveness.
To confirm that the observed effects were indeed due to protein
fouling on the surface, we conducted an image analysis ex-
periment aided by the use of GFP as the surface protein fouling
agent. In this case, plastic was imaged and the resulting fluo-
rescence intensity was quantified. To show this phenomenon is
not plastic specific, it was repeated on polyethylene (PE) and
polylactic acid (PLA) plastic films. Figures4 and 5 visually and
quantitatively highlight that the unwashed plastics of all protein
concentrations have a higher average intensity than the plastics
that have been washed. These results indicate that for PET the
surface‐bound protein is serving to inhibit the PHE from ac-
cessing the surface of the plastic and that this effect is ex-
acerbated at higher protein concentrations especially without
washing. However, further testing is needed to confirm that the
surface inaccessibility and not enzyme denaturation due to
contact with fouling agents is the cause of the decrease in
released monomers observed.
3.3 | Protein ‐Based Inhibition Is Observed Across
Alternative PHEs
There are many recorded enzymes with the ability to degrade
PET as verified by the Plastics‐Active Enzymes Database (PAZy)
that lists 124 biochemically characterized wild type enzymes
(Buchholz et al.2022). Many of these enzymes have also been
engineered to further increase hydrolytic activity and thermo-
stability. While our previous assays indicate that protein con-
tent can strongly inhibit PET degradation using FAST‐PETase,
we wanted to test to see if this effect was more universal
through testing a very different PHE. Specifically, we tested
GuaPA as it is a PHE originating from a thermophilic archaea
in the Guymas Basin off the coast of Mexico and contains a
highly negative surface charge making it more unique in its
plastic‐enzyme interface (Acosta et al.2025). While GuaPA has
FIGURE 3 | Wash conditions ameliorate the effects of protein fouling. Five wash conditions along with a no wash control condition were tested
to see if the effect of the surface protein fouling could be reversed. For all protein concentrations tested, there was no significant difference between
the wash conditions when using a one‐way ANOVA. Using a one‐way ANOVA, there is a significant difference which is more drastic at higher
protein concentrations. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
3094 Biotechnology and Bioengineering, 2025
overall lower activity than FAST‐PETase, it exhibits a similar
inhibition of degradation from increasing concentrations of
protein fouling (Figure 6). Interestingly, while the water and
Tris‐NaOH washes are able to restore near protein‐free degra-
dation efficiencies for the FAST‐PETase reaction, this was not the
case for the GuaPA reaction thus implicating a potential higher
sensitivity to protein fouling. Figure7 illustrates the relationship
between the percentage of the plastics surface covered with GFP
relates to the released monomer concentration. We can see that
these two variables are negatively correlated: with increasing
protein surface coverage, there is less monomers released. The
observed trend, while similar, occurs differently for both PHEs.
For FAST‐PETase (Figure7A), complete inhibition of degrada-
tion is seen when protein covers more than 20% of the plastic
surface, whereas for GuaPA (Figure7B), complete inhibition of
degradation is seen when the protein covers less than 10% of the
surface area, again implicating that GuaPA may be more sensi-
tive to the effects of extraneous protein.
These results highlight the difference in PHE activity and sen-
sitivity to protein fouling. We can extrapolate from these two
examples that other PHEs will likely be similarly impacted by
protein fouling. It is thus important to consider the source,
purity, and handling of PET plastic before biodegradation.

substrates, which were subsequently imaged using a Bio‐Rad GelDoc Go imaging system, and the resulting images were analyzed using Image Lab

PLA increased fluorescence intensity was seen for the increasing concentrations of GFP of the unwashed samples.

This can be an important factor especially when the plastic is
used in very high‐protein content environments such as single‐
use plastics in the medical and biotech fields.
4 | Conclusions
Excess protein originating either from fouling on the plastic
surface or present in the reaction buffer can reduce the degra-
dation capabilities of PHEs. This effect is amplified with
increasing amounts of protein. Moreover, this effect also has
implications when looking for the optimal concentration of PHE
in PET degradation as too much protein can inhibit the reaction.
Through image analysis, we observe the protein fouling and can
examine the efficacy of various wash steps at the macroscopic
level. These findings are important when considering biological
recycling, especially with regard to the pre‐processing of input
plastics. Furthermore, in situ, environmental degradation of
plastics is sure to be faced with these same contamination issues
(likely in a location‐dependent manner) and thus should be
considered when deploying future technologies.

FIGURE 6 | Protein fouling effect is not specific to FAST‐PETase. Using GFP as the surface fouling protein, the differences between two different
PHEs were tested. (A, FAST‐PETase; B, GuaPA) Similar effects are seen between the two enzymes in the unwashed condition for all contaminating
protein concentrations; however, the overall monomer release for GuaPA is lower than FAST‐PETase. For GuaPA at higher protein concentrations,
the activity does not return to that of the conditions with no protein fouling even after washing. Statistical analysis was done between the wash and
no wash conditions for each protein fouling concentration for both enzymes using one‐way ANOVA. *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001.
