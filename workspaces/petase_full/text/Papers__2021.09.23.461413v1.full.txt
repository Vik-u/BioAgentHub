Abstract 
Plastic pollution spawned a global challenge caused by  the environmental accumulation of 
polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastics. Ongoing remediation efforts using microbial and 
engineered PET hydrolyzing enzymes (PETases) are hindered by slow depolymerization activities. 
Here, we report the optimized reaction conditions that leveraged the PETase hydrolase activity 2 to 
3.8-fold in the presence of high NaCl concentrations. Molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) were 
applied to model salt-dependent conformational changes of the PETase enzyme bound to a 3 -unit 
PET polymer. MDS demonstrated that PETase interaction with flanking polymer units exhibited a 
striking structural disparity at low and high salt concentrations. At low salt concentrations, flanking 
polymer units displayed significant bending. In contrast, flanking units  extended at high salt 
concentrations, thus residues D206, H237, and S160 of the catalytic triad positioned in close vicinity 
of the scissile ester bond of the polymer substrate. The resulting high salt-specific enzyme/substrate 
geometry can potentially facilitate hydrolysis. We theorized that a salt-dependent conformational 
switch could attenuate the enzyme to a broad range of natural and artificial polymers consumed as 
carbon sources. Altogether, new knowledge may advance the engineering of PET hydrolase enzymes 
and benefit bioconversion programs. 
Introduction 
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a versatile plastic mass-produced for a variety of  industrial and 
consumer products. The annual worldwide manufacturing of PET ha s reached  50 million tons  and is 
expected to double every five years. O ver 30% of post -consumer plastic waste is amounted by PET. 
Although PET waste recycling has improved, accelerating industrial production and high resistance to 
environmental degradation impact recycling efforts. Especially concerning are PET microparticles that 
accumulate in ocean water and severely impact marine life (1, 2).  
Bioconversion and bioremediation are two ways to reduce the adverse effects of plastic pollution. In 
response to the environmental impact of accumulating plastic waste, specialized enzymatic and catabolic 
pathways that utilize plastics as a carbon and energy source  have naturally evolved. Bacteria, yeast, and 
fungi inhabiting environments with plastic debris can  potentially use PET as a primary carbon sourc e. 
Ideonella sakaiensis, a bacteria isolated at a recycling facility, can decompose PET, albeit relatively slowly 
(3). I. sakaiensis secretes two PET degrading enzymes: PETase and MHETase. PETase hydrolyses PET 
polymers to mono-2-hydroxyethyl (MHET) and bis-2-hydroxyethyl terephthalic acids (BHET). MHETase 
further converts MHET into ethylene glycol  that breaks down in soil  (4). An ongoing effort  by the 
international community aimed to  re-engineer enzymes with increased activity and stability for in situ  
remediations (5-16). However, engineered enzymes that exhibit high enzymatic activity under varying and 
challenging environmental conditions, including high or low temperatures, extreme acidity, or high salinity, 
will be required.  
The  optimization of PETase enzymatic characteristics that drastically increased the hydrolytic activity is 
reported here. We combined biochemical assays and molecular dynamic simulations (MDS) to propose a 
model of enzyme-substrate interaction under optimized conditions.

p-Nitrophenyl acetate (p- NPA) was from TCI America  ( Portland, OR, USA) . Horseradish peroxidase 
(HRP)-conjugated donkey anti-mouse IgGs was from Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories (West Grove, 
PA, USA). All other reagents were from MilliporeSigma (Burlington, MA, USA) 
Enzyme purification 
cDNA sequence of P ETase was derived from Ideonella sakaiensis isolate amino acid sequence (3) with 
modifications described (12). Flag-tag and 9xHistidine tag were added at the C- terminus of the PETase. 
Synthetic constructs were manufactured by Genscript (Piscataway, NJ, USA)  and inserted into the pET-
21b(+) vector (Novogene, Boston, MA, USA) at NdeI and Xho I sites to generate pET-21b-PETase-SW 
expression plasmid.  
Protein expression was conducted in E.coli  BL21 (DE3) Codon Plus cells (Agilent Technologies , San 
Diego, CA, USA). Induced cultures were grown at 18°C overnight. Cells were collected by centrifugation 
(5,000g for 20 min), and pellets were resuspended in 50 ml of purification buffer (Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 
500 m M NaCl supplemented with protease inhibitors ). Cell suspensions were incubated with 5 mg/ml 
lysozyme on ice for 30 min and disrupted by sonication. Proteins were purified using Protino NTA columns 
(Macherey-Nagel, Freemansburg, PA, USA ) using linear imidazole gradients (30- 250 mM ). Protein 
identity was confirmed by immunoblotting. Protein concentrations were measured using Coomassie Protein 
Assays. Purified proteins were concentrated by dialysis in storage buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH 8.0, 
500 mM NaCl supplemented with 50% glycerol). Aliquots were stored at -80°C. 
PETase activity assay 
PETase activity was measured  in 96 wells plates for 20 min by optical absorption at 400 nm using 
SpectraFluor Plus microplate reader (Tecan US, Morrisville, NC, USA). Reactions were conducted in 200 
μl of the reaction buffer (20 mM Tris -HCl, 100 mM NaCl , 0.005% Brij 35) supplemented with 100 nM 
PETase. To initiate the chromogenic reaction, 100 μM p- NPA was added to each well . All enzymatic 
activities were measured at 24°C and pH 8.0 unless indicated overwise. Optimization parameters included 
pH (4.0-9.0), temperature (24-50°C), glycerol (0–25%), NaCl (0.1–5M), SDS (0–4%) and DMSO (0-100%) 
that were tested in respective increments as indicated on Fig . 1. Fold-change of the specific activity w as 
calculated relative to the baseline. To control the non-enzymatic hydrolysis of p-NPA, parallel reactions for 
each optimization parameter were conducted without PETase. 
Statistical and kinetics analysis 
A t wo-tailed unpaired t -test with Welch 's correlations parametric test was used to compare enzyme 
activities between test groups. P- value <0.05 was considered significant. Enzymatic parameters were 
calculated and visualized using GraphPad Prism (GraphPad Software Inc, USA). 
MD simulations 
3D structures of PETase (PDB:6ANE) (11)  and 1-2(-hydroxyethyl) 4 -methyl terephthalate (HEMT) 
(PDB:5XH3) (17) were from Protein Data Bank (https://www.rcsb.org). Molecular dynamics (MD) 
simulations with and without docked substrate were performed using the AMBER18 package (18, 19). The 
systems were placed in the truncated octahedron periodic box of the TIP3P water model (20). The distance 
between protein and the edge of the box to at least 1 nm. Electrostatic interactions were treated using 
Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) approach (21) with a 0.16 nm grid, fourth- order cubic interpolations, and 
tolerance of 10
-5. Van der Waals interactions were calculated using a 10 Å cutoff. Simulations systems were

minimized using the steepest descent method, then the systems were gradually heated to 300K  and 
equilibrated. P roduction runs were performed using NPT ensemble s (p=1 atm , T=300K, 0.5 µsec 
timescale). FF14SB (22) and GAFF force field parameters (23) were applied to the protein and substrate 
model, respectively. Atomic charges were determined using the RESP model (24) . Simulations were 
performed with ion numbers corresponding to low and high salt concentrations (4M NaCl solution). 3D 
models were visualized in PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.3.2 Schrödinger, 
LLC). 
Results and discussion 
High salt concentration leverages the enzymatic activity of PETase 
Chromogenic assays using p -NPA as a substrate were conducted to explore the effect of environmental 
conditions on PETase enzymatic activity. To optimize the reaction conditions, reactions were supplemented 
with the following chemical additives: NaCl (0.1-5M), glycerol (0–25.0%), SDS (0-4.0%), and DMSO (0-
100%).  
Strikingly, a dramatic increase of the PETase enzymatic activity at NaCl concentrations from 500 mM to 5 
M was observed (Fig. 1 A-F). The highest specific activity (3.8-fold increase) was measured at 5M NaCl. 
High activities were observed in seawater ( salinity of ~35 parts per thousand (ppt), 0.47 M NaCl ). In 
addition, increased activities in the presence of SDS <0.5% and 5% (v/v) glycerol were detected. SDS 
(above 3%) and DMSO negatively affected the activity.  
To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of significantly leveraged PETase activity in the presence 
of NaCl concentrations above 500 mM and up to 5 M . Published studies of the PETase activity were 
conducted at NaCl concentrations typically ranging from 0 to 150 mM (3, 11, 12, 16, 17, 25) . To explain 
the effect of high salt concentration, a predictive analysis of conformational dynamics of PETase bound to 
a substrate was conducted.  
PETase/polymer complex exhibits distinct conformations at low and high salt in MDS modeling 
MDS w as applied to understand the parameters of PETase/substrate interactions at low and high  salt 
concentrations. A theoretical 3-unit PET polymer model represented a hydrolytic substrate. Published 3D 
crystal structures of the recombinant I. sakaiensis PETase (a 2.02A resolution structure (PDB:6ANE) (11) 
and a 1.58A resolution structure of the  R103G/S131A mutant PETase complex with (2-hydroxyethyl) 4-
methyl terephthalate (HEMT) (PDB:5XH3) (17)) were used to build dynamic models . Covalently bound 
HEMT was substituted with a 3-unit PET polymer (Fig. 2A-C). The central unit of a 3-unit substrate was 
reoriented to match the position s of HEMT  within the PETase catalytic center. MDS predicted the 
enzyme/substrate conformation states at 150 mM (low) to 4M (high) NaCl concentrations, and 0 ns to 500 
ns timepoints. 
According to MDS, salt mediated dramatic conformational changes in the polymer-bound PETase 
catalytic center by altering the orientation of the polymer's ester bonds relative to the catalytic residues (Fig. 
2B-C). At low salt concentrations, the positions of units 1 and 2 and PETase catalytic residues at 500 ns 
simulation timepoint matched the initial geometry, and unit 1 and 3 attained bent conformations. In contrast, 
high NaCl concentrations mediated conformational changes  in D206SIAPVNSS214 and 
I232NGGSH237FCANSGN244 catalytic loops and the polymer units relative to the catalytic residues. As a

result, unit 3 of a substrate polymer became significantly extended. Notably, unit 1 retained  its position 
near the W185 loop. The close vicinity of the catalytic triad residues D206, H237, and S160 relative to the 
scissile ester bond between units 2 and 3 potentially facilitated hydrolysis.  
We concluded that PETase exhibits salt-dependent flexibility of its catalytic and binding centers. 
Modulated by environmental factors, such as salt concentration, the enzyme can fine-tune the conformation 
of its key residues to leverage hydrolysis of a broad spectrum of natural and artificial polymers. In turn, 
organisms expressing PETase- like enzymes can utilize variable carbon sources  to invade new 
environmental habitats. Notably, the adaptability of PETase may be indispensable to advance plastics bio-
utilization technologies. Ocean salt water, salt-affected soils, and locations with the increased salinity can 
potentially serve as efficient sites for in-situ bio-decomposition.
