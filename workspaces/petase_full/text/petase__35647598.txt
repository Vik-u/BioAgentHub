ABSTRACT: Interfacial enzyme reactions are common in Nature
and in industrial settings, including the enzymatic deconstruction
of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) waste. Kinetic descriptions
of PET hydrolases are necessary for both comparative analyses,
discussions of structure−function relations and rational optimiza-
tion of technical processes. We investigated whether the Sabatier
principle could be used for this purpose. Speciﬁcally, we compared
the kinetics of two well-known PET hydrolases, leaf-branch
compost cutinase (LCC) and a cutinase from the bacterium
Thermobiﬁda fusca(TfC), when adding diﬀerent concentrations of
the surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). We
found that CTAB consistently lowered the strength of enzyme−
PET interactions, while its eﬀect on enzymatic turnover was strongly biphasic. Thus, at gradually increasing CTAB concentrations,
turnover was initially promoted and subsequently suppressed. This correlation with maximal turnover at an intermediate binding
strength was in accordance with the Sabatier principle. One consequence of these results was that both enzymes had too strong
intrinsic interaction with PET for optimal turnover, especially TfC, which showed a 20-fold improvement ofk
cat at the maximum.
LCC on the other hand had an intrinsic substrate aﬃnity closer to the Sabatier optimum, and the turnover rate was 5-fold improved
at weakened substrate binding. Our results showed that the Sabatier principle may indeed rationalize enzymatic PET degradation
and support process optimization. Finally, we suggest that future discovery eﬀorts should consider enzymes with weakened substrate
binding because strong adsorption seems to limit their catalytic performance.

■ INTRODUCTION
Enzymatic hydrolysis of poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET)
has been recognized as a potential technology for bioprocess-
ing of some plastic waste streams. 1 Several studies have
reported promising enzyme candidates, including the PETase
from Ideonella sakaiensis,2 the leaf-branch compost cutinase
(LCC),3,4 and cutinases from variousThermobiﬁda species.5−8
However, there is still a need to engineer better catalytic
eﬃciency and improve reaction conditions on PET. Previous
activity in this area has used strategies such as rational redesign
of the active site,9,10 construction of chimeric enzymes with
binding modules,11,12 and application of surfactants in the
reaction medium.13,14
To optimize enzymes rationally, it is crucial to have a
molecular-level understanding of structure−function relation-
ships. The experimental input that links structure and function
is typically kinetic data, but there is no general framework to
rationalize the kinetics of these interfacial enzymes, and this
has hampered fundamental and comparative descriptions of
PET hydrolases. In lack of a detailed kinetic model, the PET
hydrolase reaction may be coarsely described by its most basic
steps; complexation, catalysis, and dissociation, as shown in
Figure 1A. In this three-step model, theﬁrst involves enzyme
adsorption on the substrate surface and transfer of a piece of
the PET molecule into the enzyme’s active site. The second
step encompasses the covalent changes of the hydrolytic
reaction (catalysis), while the third delineates product release
and the enzyme’s dissociation to the aqueous bulk. This model
bears some resemblance to the classical Henri−Michaelis−
Menten scheme, but as the substrate is insoluble, the
complexation step di ﬀers fundamentally. Unlike enzymes
acting in the bulk phase, interfacial enzymes such as PET
hydrolases need to compete with attractive forces in the
substrate matrix to make a productive enzyme −substrate
complex

the eﬀective substrate concentration in interfacial enzyme
reactions may be correlated with ligand-binding strength.
Thus, the tighter the binding, the more diverse polymer
conformations on the surface could potentially be transferred

to the active site.18−20 However, a high ligand-binding aﬃnity
may come at the cost of turnover speed.21 This type of tradeoﬀ
between binding strength and rate is well-known within
inorganic, heterogeneous catalysis, and is originally coined as
the Sabatier principle, which states that e ﬃcient catalysis
occurs when the catalyst binds its reactant with intermediate
strength.
22,23 The Sabatier principle has recently been proven
useful for predicting and rationalizing catalytic properties of
cellulases24,25 and as a guide for computer-aided enzyme
design and discovery.26
In this study, we investigate whether the Sabatier principle
could rationalize the kinetics of two well-known PET
hydrolases; LCC and a cutinase from the thermophilic
bacterium Thermobiﬁda fusca (TfC). We used two types of
steady-state measurements to assess kinetic parameters for the
hydrolysis of suspended PET particles and tuned enzyme−
substrate binding strength through the addition of the cationic
surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB).
■ RESULTS
We have applied a modi ﬁed Michaelis −Menten (MM)
approach to assess the kinetics of two PET hydrolases, LCC
and TfC. Speciﬁcally, we collected one set of data in the
conventional way with substrate excess (
convMM analysis),
while another was made in the inverse concentration regime
with enzyme excess (
invMM analysis). We characterized both
enzymes at diﬀerent concentrations of the cationic surfactant
CTAB, and derived kinetic parameters for bothconvMM and
inv MM by non-linear regression as described in the
Experimental section and in the Supporting Information .
Experimental data (circles) and the results of the regression
analyses (lines) are illustrated inFigure 2.
Experimental values for the kinetic parametersinvKM, invVmax,
convKM, andconvVmax (deﬁned ineqs 2−6, Experimental section)
derived in Figure 2 are listed in Table S1 in theSupporting
Information. Inspection of these numbers revealed systematic
eﬀects of the surfactant. In particular, we found that the
maximal speciﬁc rate from both the conventional (convVmax/E0,
eq 6 )a n di n v e r s e(invVmax/S0*, eq 4 )a n a l y s e ss h o w e d
distinctive maxima at intermediate CTAB concentrations
(Figure 3). To put these observations into perspective, we
reiterate the meaning of the two parameters.convVmax/E0 is the
usual maximal turnover ( eq 6 ), which is experimentally
observed when essentially all enzymes are complexed (when
[ES] ∼ E0). The inverse parameter,invVmax/S0*, speciﬁes the
rate when all attack sites on the PET surface is covered with
enzyme (eq 4). The eﬀect of CTAB on these two parameters
was distinctive and quite similar for both enzymes. Thus, for
LCC both parameters increased approximately 5-fold between
[CTAB] = 0 and the maximum at [CTAB]∼ 6 μM( Figure 3).
The analogous increment for TfC was up to 20-fold, and it

performance of a highly eﬃcient (LCC) and a mediocre (TfC)
PET hydrolase.
We conducted several experiments to explore possible
origins of the biphasic curves in Figure 3. First, we found
that at the concentrations used here, CTAB had no signiﬁcant
eﬀect on the two enzymes’ thermostability, expressed as the
apparent transition temperature,Tm,( Figure 4A). This ﬁgure
also shows thatTm for LCC was the same (about 84°C) as
reported previously in calcium-free buﬀer.4 As a result, it was
not deemed necessary to supplement the experiments (at 50
°C) with calcium although this has been shown to signiﬁcantly
improve thermal stability of LCC.
4 We only found minor
eﬀects of CTAB on the catalytic performance against the small
soluble substrate, 4-nitrophenyl butyrate (pNP-Bu). Speciﬁ-
cally, when adding a (low) CTAB concentration corresponding
to the ascending parts inFigure 3, we found no eﬀect on the
activity of LCC and a moderate inhibitory e ﬀect on TfC
(Figure 4B). Hence, the large initial increments inFigure 3
could not be related to an intrinsic boost in enzyme activity
generated by the surfactant. Finally, we assessed whether long-
term exposure of the enzymes to high concentrations of
CTAB, corresponding to the descending parts in Figure 3,
resulted in a subsequent decrease in kinetic performance
toward pNP-Bu. The results (Figure S3 in the Supporting
Information) did not reveal any loss of enzyme activity, and we
conclude that CTAB does not signi ﬁcantly in ﬂuence the
kinetic stability of the enzymes.

However, saturation coverage was higher for LCC, 40± 4.1

■ DISCUSSION
In recent years, gradually better PET degrading enzymes have
been identiﬁed, and this has spurred optimism regarding
bioprocessing of PET waste. 27−31 However, continuous
improvement of catalytic eﬃciency through engineering and
discovery of novel enzymes will probably be necessary to make
biological approaches viable contributions to a circular plastic
economy. Progress in thisﬁeld would beneﬁt from a general
framework to compare and rationalize the performance of
diﬀerent enzymes and conditions, and in the current work, we
propose one potential approach to this. The two main
elements in the suggested framework are a modi ﬁed MM
analysis (Figure 2) and the Sabatier principle.
Our results (see Figure 3) revealed that addition of the
surfactant CTAB had a distinctive and biphasic eﬀect on the
catalytic performance of two PET hydrolases. Especially for
TfC, moderate amounts of CTAB (20−30 μM) substantially
accelerated the maximal rate for both conventional and inverse
MM kinetics. This CTAB concentration is one or two orders
of magnitude below the critical micelle concentration,
32 and it
did not exert any measurable reduction in the thermostability
of the investigated enzymes ( Figure 4 A). Neither did it
signiﬁcantly alter the catalytic eﬃcacy on a soluble substrate
(Figures 4B and S3), and in light of this, we will test whether
the biphasic behavior could reﬂect CTAB-induced alterations
in the strength of interactions with the insoluble substrate.
This idea has been discussed before. In particular, Furukawa
and co-workers reported a bene ﬁcial e ﬀect of charged
surfactants on the enzymatic hydrolysis of PET ﬁlms. They
found that an anionic surfactant promoted activity of the
positively charged PETase from I. sakaiensis,
14 and that a
cationic surfactant boosted activity of another PET hydrolase,
which carried a net-negative charge at the experimental pH.
13
These observations were collectively ascribed to enhanced
enzyme adsorption driven by electrostatic interactions between
enzyme and an oppositely charged surfactant that accumulated
on the PET surface. However, this interpretation is not readily
transferred to the current data. First, we observed both
activating and inhibitory eﬀects of the same surfactant (Figure
3). Second, the two investigated enzymes have pI values,
respectively, above (LCC: pI 9.3) and below (TfC: pI 6.3) the
experimental pH (pH 8.0). Nevertheless, the two enzymes
responded analogously to the addition of CTAB and the
concomitant buildup of positive charge on the PET surface.
In search of a more robust interpretation of the biphasic
behavior inFigure 3, we note that the Michaelis constant may
be used as a descriptor of substrate aﬃnity.
33,34 Thus, while
not a true binding constant, the concentration required to
reach half-saturation under diﬀerent conditions provides some
ranking of substrate interaction strength. As illustrated in Table
S1A in theSupporting Information, we found that K
M values
increased regularly with the surfactant load throughout the
investigated range. We conclude that CTAB consistently
lowered the strength of enzyme−substrate interactions, and we
will discuss the results in this perspective. We acknowledge
that other more speciﬁce ﬀects of CTAB may inﬂuence the
maximal speciﬁc rates, and we will return to this in the
concluding paragraph.
General relationships between binding strength and catalytic
turnover can be expressed by the Sabatier principle,
35 which

states that catalysis is most e ﬀective when the interaction
between a catalyst and reactants is intermediate in strength.
The intuitive underpinning is that tight binding implies slow
dissociation of stable enzyme−substrate intermediates, while
weak binding is associated with low complex concentration.
Both of these limiting cases lead to a poor overall rate, while an
intermediate binding strength balances oﬀ the two eﬀects and
hence supports a faster turnover. The Sabatier principle has
been widely employed within inorganic, heterogeneous
catalysis,
36 but it has also been applied to interfacial enzyme
reactions.24,37 Experimentally, the principle can be illustrated
in so-called volcano plots, which have a measure of catalytic
eﬃcacy such as turnover frequency on the ordinate and
interaction strength on the abscissa. For the current systems,
this implies plotting the maximal speci ﬁc rate from either
invMM or convMM as a function of binding strength expressed
as a Michaelis constant.Figure 6 illustrates such plots, where
we used invKM (i.e., the enzyme concentration required to
reach half-saturation under conditions of enzyme excess) as a
descriptor of binding strength. These plots clearly had volcano-
like shapes and hence corroborated that intermediate binding
strength provides the most eﬃcient catalysis in accord with the
Sabatier principle.
One consequence of data in Figure 6 is that LCC and
particularly TfC bind their substrate too tightly for eﬃcient
catalysis. The tight binding of TfC was reﬂected both in a low
invKM (77 ± 15 nM, Table S1 ) and the independently
measured KD value (22 ± 1.9 nM, Figure 5). This strong
substrate a ﬃnity occurred together with a slow maximal
turnover of TfC (kcat ∼ 0.04 s−1), but when the interaction was
weakened by CTAB to a level ofinvKM ∼ 140 nM, the turnover
rose dramatically to about 0.8 s−1. Interestingly, aninvKM of this
magnitude also gave rise to the highest values of bothkcat for
LCC (1.6 s−1, Figure 6A) and maxima in the inverse speciﬁc
rates for both enzymes (Figure 6B). Hence, it appears that a
substrate aﬃnity speciﬁed by invKM ∼ 140 nM represents the
Sabatier optimum, where the lifetime of the enzyme−substrate
complex attains a favorable, intermediate value. As the inherent
substrate aﬃnity measured without CTAB (seeFigure 5) was
lower for LCC compared to TfC, it required less CTAB to
bring LCC to the Sabatier optimum (Figure 6). This implied
that the inherent substrate aﬃnity of LCC was closer to the
Sabatier optimum, which explains the larger activity increment
(Figure 6A) at the maximum of TfC (20-fold) compared to
LCC (5-fold). The binding aﬃnity of LCC appears to be
better tuned for the substrate and hence there is less to gain for
this enzyme.
Comparisons of LCC and TfC may be expanded by
considering speciﬁc changes in
invMM andconvMM parameters,
respectively. To this end, we already noted that the maximal
turnover, k
cat = convVmax/E0 (eq 6), at the Sabatier optimum
was about twice as high for LCC than for TfC (Figure 6A).

or (B) substrate saturation condition (invVmax/S0*) is plotted against the enzyme−substrate binding aﬃnity (invKM) for diﬀerent concentrations of
CTAB in the background, as speciﬁed by the label in the plot. Symbols represent kinetic parameters, and solid lines are guide to the eye.

Comparisons of the inverse maximal rateinvVmax/S0*, illustrated
in Figure 6B, are more complicated as it reﬂects the product of
kcat and Γmax (eq 4). From the binding isotherm inFigure 5,i t
can be seen that LCC had around two times more binding sites
than TfC. As bothk
cat and Γmax were 2-fold higher for LCC, we
would expect that this enzyme performed 4-fold better than
TfC under the most favorable conditions (i.e., when the
substrate is saturated with enzyme, and the binding strength is
adjusted to the Sabatier optimum). This prediction is
conﬁrmed in Figure 6 B, where direct and independent
measurements of
invVmax/S0* gave maximal values of about 9
and 40 nmol g−1 s−1 for TfC and LCC, respectively. This
supports the conclusion that the superior performance of LCC
on PET, which is widely recognized,
3,4,28,38 reﬂects partly a
low, nearly optimal substrate aﬃnity (which is associated with
ah i g hkcat) and partly a high capacity of combining
productively with di ﬀerent polymer conformations on the
PET surface (high attack site density). If indeed so, it would be
relevant to investigate other PET hydrolases with variable
substrate a ﬃn i t y .S of a r ,f o c u sh a sb e e no nh i g h
aﬃnity,
11,12,39−43 but the current work hints that this strategy
may not always be fruitful. Hence, we suggest that future
discovery campaigns consider enzymes with a broad spectrum
of substrate-binding strengths.
In conclusion, we have found that eﬀects of the cationic
surfactant CTAB on the kinetics of two PET-hydrolases may
be rationalized along the lines of the Sabatier principle. We
hasten to say, that other, more speciﬁce ﬀects of the surfactant
cannot be ruled out by the current experiments. However,
controls focusing on thermodynamic- and kinetic enzyme
stability as well as the general catalytic performance against
soluble substrate failed to explain the pronounced kinetic
alterations observed on insoluble PET. Instead, we propose
that the biphasic eﬀect of CTAB on the enzymatic turnover
reﬂected a continuous weakening in enzyme −substrate
interactions as surfactant concentrations rose. This weakening
initially promoted and subsequently suppressed enzyme
activity as stipulated by the Sabatier principle. If indeed
applicable, this principle may be useful both in discussions of
structure−function relationship and for the optimization of
technical PET degradation. Regarding the latter, we note that
the current work only covered conditions of very low (<1%)
degrees of PET conversion, where progress curves on the same
substrate have previously been shown to be essentially linear.
44
This is a formal prerequisite for the steady-state kinetic analysis
performed here, but not for use of the Sabatier principle per se.
Future experimental work may elucidate whether the principle
can be applied to lengthy, industrially relevant reaction
conditions and if so, it could become a valuable instrument
within both enzyme discovery and optimization of reaction
conditions for PET hydrolases.
■ EXPERIMENTAL SECTION
Enzymes
Two cutinases, LCC [PDB: 4EB0] and TfC from T. fusca [PDB:
5ZOA], were heterologously expressed inBacillus subtilisand puriﬁed
in a similar way as described previously.45,46 The two enzymes are of
the same size (28 kDa) and have a sequence identity of approximately
60%. The production of LCC incorporated the following two
modiﬁcations compared to the published procedures. The native
signal peptide was replaced by the signal peptide from the B.
licheniformis α-amylase AmyL (FJ556804.1), and a histidine tag (6xH)
was added to the C-terminal. A small linker consisting of LE was
inserted between the C-terminal and His-tag. The fermentation broth
was sterileﬁltrated and 500 mM NaCl was added and adjusted to pH
7.5/NaOH. The sample was loaded onto a Ni-Sepharose six Fast
Flow column (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA) equilibrated in
50 mM HEPES, pH 7.5 with 500 mM NaCl (buﬀer A). After loading,
the column was washed with 10 column volumes of buﬀer A, and
bound proteins were eluted with 500 mM imidazole in buﬀer A. The
fractions containing the enzyme were pooled and applied to a
Sephadex G-25 (medium) (GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ, USA)
column equilibrated and eluted in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.5. Enzyme
concentrations were determined by Abs280. Molar extinction
coeﬃcients and theoretical pI values were calculated using the
protein identiﬁcation and analysis tools in the ExPASy Server.
47 Tm of
the enzymes was determined by di ﬀerential scanning ﬂuorimetry
using a Nanotemper Prometheus Nt.48 (Nanotemper). Enzyme
samples (in pure phosphate buﬀer or supplemented with 10 or 100
μM CTAB) were heated from 20°Ct o9 5°C at 10% laser intensity
and a rate of 1.5°C/min.
Substrates and Chemicals
The PET substrate used was a semicrystalline PET powder purchased
from Goodfellow Co. UK (Product number ES306031). The typical
particle size was about 100μm.48 This substrate has previously been
characterized with a reported Mw of 33 kDa and % crystallinity of
38.49 The powder was suspended in 50 mM sodium phosphate
(NaPi) buﬀer pH 8.0. The surfactant CTAB (57-09-0) and the
substrate pNP-Bu(2635-84-9) were both purchased from Sigma.
Binding Isotherms
The adsorption of TfC and LCC to PET was determined using a PET
concentration of 50 g/L and (total) enzyme concentrations ranging
from 0−2 μM. Adsorption measurements used 1 h equilibration in a
thermomixer operated at 1000 rpm at 50 °C, and non-binding
microtiter plates (Greiner Bio-One) were used to reduce
unproductive binding. Solids and liquids were separated by
centrifugation in a temperature-controlled centrifuge, set to 50°C.
The protein content of the supernatant was determined using a micro
bicinchoninic acid protein kit from Thermo Fischer scienti ﬁc
(product number 23225), as described previously.48 Standard curves
of the two enzymes (ranging from 0−2 μM in concentration) were
used to quantify the amount of free enzyme in the reactions
(performed in triplicate). The bound enzyme population was
calculated from the di ﬀerence between the total and the free
concentrations, and the bound fraction was used to assess binding
parameters as described previously.
48
Activity Assay withpNP-Bu
To investigate potential side eﬀects of the surfactant CTAB on the
two enzymes, not related to surface phenomena and the Sabatier
principle, we investigated activity on a soluble pNP-substrate at
diﬀerent concentrations of CTAB. One set of experiments was
performed in order to investigate if a long contact time with a high
amount of CTAB present (concentrations that resulted in a decrease
in PET activity) possibly resulted in (irreversible) enzyme
denaturation. This control was performed in two steps, with the
ﬁrst involving incubation of the enzymes with either CTAB or in pure
50 mM NaPi buﬀer at 50°C, shaking at 300 rpm. The samples were
incubated in microtiter plates with 10μM enzyme and 0, 10, or 40
μM CTAB (LCC) or 0, 40, or 80μM CTAB (TfC). After 2 h, the
samples were 1000-fold diluted toﬁnal enzyme concentrations of 10
nM. These enzyme dilutions were used in a second step, where
enzyme activity was monitored onpNP-Bu. In a microtiter plate, 5
nM enzyme and 5 mM pNP-Bu were mixed, and the enzymatic
release ofpNP was monitored over 5 min in a plate reader at 405 nm
at 25 °C. Reactions were performed in duplicate, and blank samples
without enzymes were included. The concentration of releasedpNP
was calculated from standards with known concentrations.
We also assessed possible eﬀects of CTAB on progress curves,
which used the soluble pNP substrate. In a volume of 100 μL,
reactions with 50 mM buﬀer, 5 nM enzyme, and 5 mMpNP-Bu,
either with or without CTAB (1μM for LCC and 10μM for TfC),

1228
were prepared, and the enzymatic release ofpNP was monitored and
analyzed as explained above. The CTAB concentrations were selected
to match concentrations resulting in an increased catalytic rate in the
activity measurement on the insoluble PET substrate.
Activity Assay for Solid PET Substrate and MM Analysis
For determination of PET hydrolase activity on insoluble PET, a plate
reader-based assay (Abs240) adapted for initial rate kinetics was used,
described in detail elsewhere.
50 Enzyme reactions were performed at
50 °C, in 50 mM NaPi buﬀer pH 8, using non-binding microtiter
plates (Greiner Bio-One), in an incubator operated at 450 rpm (KS
4000 ic control, IKA, Staufen, Germany). Initial activity measure-
ments were performed in duplicate with aﬁnal volume of 250μL. The
load of PET was 10 g/L, enzyme concentrations were 0.10μM, and
the CTAB concentration range was from 0 to 100μM. The contact
times for these reactions were 2 h for TfC and 30 min for LCC.
Enzymatic product formation was quantiﬁed as “bis(2-hydroxyethyl)
terephthalate equivalents” (BHETeq), which were deﬁned by the
supernatant absorbance at 240 nm normalized against standard curves
of BHET. Hence, the derived rates were based on soluble products
only and this has previously been shown to be a good descriptor of
the overall activity.50 The results from initial activity measurements
are presented in Figure S4 in theSupporting Information.
For kinetic analysis, two sets of experiments (each performed in
triplicates) were executed, either under conditions of enzyme
saturation (
convMM) or substrate saturation (invMM). Experiments
under convMM used 0.1μM enzyme and a PET load from 0−20 g/L,
while invMM experiments used a ﬁxed PET load of 10 g/L and
enzyme concentrations from 0−1 μM. Both types of experiments
were conducted in pure buﬀer and in buﬀers supplemented by CTAB
at concentrations ranging from 1 −60 μM (TfC) and 1 −20 μM
(LCC). Other assay conditions were similar as explained above.
Data Analysis
The steady-state kinetics of LCC and TfC was analyzed under
convMM and invMM conditions. The former used a constant and low
enzyme concentration (E0) and recorded initial rates for a number of
substrate loads (S0*, speciﬁed below). These results were analyzed by
the conventional MM equation (eq 5). For invMM experiments, we
used a ﬁxed substrate load and measured initial rates at gradually
increasing enzyme concentrations,E0. These latter data were analyzed
using the inverse MM equation (eq 3). Background, validity, and
limitations of this approach have been discussed in detail else-
where,51,52 but we brieﬂy reiterate the key relationships that are
needed for the current discussion. The pivot of the analysis is the
assumption that the mass load of a substrate (S
0*) in g/L, which is
known in kinetic experiments, can be converted to an apparent molar
substrate concentration (S0) if one knows the density of accessible
surface sites (in mol/g). This number can be approximated
experimentally from a binding isotherm as the one shown inFigure
5, where the saturation coverage (Γmax) gives the number of accessible
surface sites on 1 g PET substrate. We note thatΓmax depends on both
the enzyme and the physical properties (particularly surface area) of
the insoluble substrate. The apparent molar concentration of the
substrate may be written as
=Γ *S S0m a x 0 (2)
Under the condition of enzyme excess, the steady-state rate may be
described using a rate equation, which is symmetric to the MM
equation (eq 5) and sometimes called the inverse MM equation.52

with invVmax being the maximal rate at substrate saturation (i.e., the
rate when all accessible surface sites are in complex with an enzyme).
This may be expressed as
== Γ *Vk S k Sinv
max cat 0 cat max 0 (4)
The Michaelis constant in eq 3, invKM, is the molar enzyme
concentration at the half-saturation point. The conventional MM
equation (eq 5), which holds under conditions of substrate excess,
may be expressed with K
M in mass units (g/L) as discussed
elsewhere.52

In eq 5, convVmax is the maximal rate at enzyme saturation, deﬁned
in the usual way

The Michaelis constant convKM in eq 5 has the unit of mass
concentration (g/L), but can be converted to invKM using the
relationship invKM = convKMΓmax. We used the two MM equations (eqs
3 and 5) to analyze the experimental data and the derived kinetic
parameters to rationalize and compare the kinetics of LCC and TfC.
