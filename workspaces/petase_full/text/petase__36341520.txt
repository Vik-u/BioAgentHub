Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is the most widely employed
plastic for single-use applications. The use of enzymes isolated
from microorganisms, such as PETase with the capacity to
hydrolyze PET into its monomers, represents a promising
method for its sustainable recycling. However, the accessibility
of the enzyme to the hydrolysable bonds is an important
challenge that needs to be addressed for effective biodegrada-
tion of postconsumer PET. Here, we combined an alkali pre-
treatment (25 ° C) with PETase incubation (30 ° C) with post-
consumed PET bottles. The pre-treatment modifies the surface
of the plastic and decreases its crystallinity enabling the access
of the enzyme to the hydrolysable chemical bonds. When the
alkali pre-treatment is incorporated into the enzymatic process
the degradation yields increase more than one order of
magnitude reaching values comparable to those obtained
during heating/cooling cycles. Our results show energetic
advantages over other reported pre-treatments and open new
avenues for sustainable PET recycling.
Introduction
Plastics are very useful materials, however, the gigantic world-
wide production and their uncontrolled disposal have led to
unmeasurable amounts of solid waste and pollution in rivers
and seas with great impacts in ecosystems.
[1]
The solution to
this problem needs to be addressed from several facets
including the production of bio-degradable polymers with
adequate physical properties, improving recycling processes of
existing polymers, modification of environmental policies, and
promotion of self-awareness of consumers to reduce, reuse and
recycle the plastic products.
In 2019 global plastic production reached more than 368
million tons globally,
[2]
and any proposed recycling strategy
needs to be scalable and must take into account the energy
required in the process.
[2]
Traditional methods such as mechan-
ical, chemical, pyrolysis, solvolysis recycling are costly, contam-
inating or are limited technically in separation of blends and
multilayers.
[3,4]
Enzymatic degradation is emerging as a potential
alternative route for monomer recovery, however the accessi-
bility to the hydrolysable bond makes it hardly applicable to
effective recycling. Therefore, is has been suggested that only
the combination of different technologies can address the
plastic waste recycling problem.
[3]
PET is considered the archetypical polymer that has been
recycled successfully and a model system for other polymer
families. Despite the high recycling rate of PET, this is far from
circular economy; mechanical recycling leads to inferior physical
properties in comparison to the virgin polymer, thus it is only
viable for a limited number of cycles.
[3]
Different chemical processes can be used for PET degrada-
tion including glycolysis, methanolysis and hydrolysis.
[5]
The
latter is the only process that yields terephthalic acid (TPA) and
ethylene glycol (EG), the monomers to generate new PET
polymers. However, all these processes involve high temper-
atures and/or high pressures.
[6]
These conditions require high
energy consumption to increase the reactors temperature over
100 ° C. For instance, PET thermolysis generates useful double
bond-terminated fragments but need temperatures in the
range of 250–300 ° C.
[7]
These high energy requirements hamper
their application as a sustainable recycling method of postcon-
sumer PET (for a review in the subject see ref. [8]).
Interestingly, in the last years the exciting discovery of
microorganisms with capacity to degrade PET into monomers
operating under very mild conditions have opened new
research avenues.
[9–11]
The rate of polymer biodegradation
depends on several factors such as polymer molecular weights,
and degree of crystallinity.
[12,13]
Indeed, the accessibility of the
enzyme to the polymer bonds to cleave is one of the major
challenges in highly crystalline polymers that forms highly
packed domains. Thus, active enzymes for PET depolymeriza-
tion show that their catalytic activities are very low hindering
their application in commercial biodegradation. The activity of
the enzymes has been improved by introducing different
mutations but degradation of highly crystalline post-consumer

PET remains challenging.
[14–16]
Therefore, additional chemical or
biological processes are required to increase their activity.
Different pre-treatment processes have been employed to
increase the enzymatic activity such as heating prior to
enzymatic degradation that reduces PET crystallinity, see below
in the discussion, or use of other proteins, like hydrophobins to
improve PETase accessibility in high crystallinity PET.
[17]
In spite
of these advances, pretreatments to make biodegradation
systems efficient still suffer from high energy requirements or
involve complex treatments.
In this work, we aim to explore sustainable processes to
biodegrade postconsumer PET into monomers that could be
repolymerized into virgin polymer for effective circular econo-
my. We propose the use of an alkali pre-treatment at very mild
temperatures to improve the access of PETase onto the polymer
surface. We found that under these conditions the yield of
depolymerized monomers production is increased by a factor
of 10.
Results and Discussion
We base our study on the well-known PETase from Ideonella
sakaiensis enzymatic activity.
[18,19]
PETase can follow different
pathways to produce TPA and monohydroxyethyl terephthalate
(MHET) and ethylene Glycol (EG)
[19–21]
(Figure 1A). Here, we
compare the activity of this enzyme on untreated highly
crystalline (~ 35 %) post-consumer PET water bottle with its
activity on a similar substrate that has been previously treated
with an alkali (NaOH, 10 M) at room temperature (25 ° C) during
24 h. The PETase incubation is also carried out on both
substrates at mild temperatures (30 ° C), the optimal temper-
ature for PETase.
[22,23]
First, we observed visual differences between untreated and
NaOH pre-treated samples (Figure 1B). Whilst the untreated
sample is transparent and colorless the NaOH pre-treatment on
the PET sample leads to an opaque substrate and white in
color.
We next examine the surface of the PET plastic samples by
Scanning Electronic Microscopy (SEM) of plastic specimens
before and after the enzymatic treatment. We find that the
post-consumer PET plastic that has not received a pre-treat-
ment shows a very smooth surface with the presence of small
crystalline granules embedded into the polymer matrix (Fig-
ure 2A). However, the sample that has been treated with NaOH
shows a rough surface with texture in the range of tens of
microns (Figure 2B).
The two plastic substrates were incubated with the enzyme
during 96 h at 30 ° C and were also analyzed by SEM. The
morphology of the non-pre-treated PET that has been incu-
bated with the PETase (Figure 2C) shows that the surface is also
affected with formation of scales indicating that the enzyme
has worked through the surface of the polymer. Alternatively,
the combination of the alkali pretreatment with enzymatic
degradation (Figure 2D) leads to a much severe surface
degradation as compared with the rest of the samples. These
findings suggest that the pretreatment seem to prepare the
surface for improved enzyme accessibility.
Given the morphological alterations we next set to evaluate
possible changes in the crystallinity of the plastic pieces. To
that end, we measured the Differential Scanning Calorimetry
(DSC) of the untreated and NaOH-treated PET samples (Fig-
ure 3). Using DSC the crystallinity is calculated by comparison of
the heat required to melt the crystalline fractions, melting
enthalpy corresponds to the peak with positive values, with the
heat that the sample takes from the system during crystalliza-
tion during cooling, cold crystallization enthalpy corresponds to

peak with negatives values.
[23]
We observed that PET crystallinity
was reduced from 33.70 � 0.05 % to 27.68 � 0.34 % after the
NaOH treatment. Although this reduction may not seem high,
reported results suggest that even a small reduction in the
crystallinity of the polymer substrate is sufficient to increase the
catalytic activity of the enzymes.
[24]
To evaluate if the surface morphological alterations leads to
improved hydrolysis during enzymatic treatment, we quantified
the MHET + TPA production in each sample by using High
Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). Separation meth-
ods are difficult due to the low solubility of the products and
the presence of oligomers that block the HPLC columns. For
this reason, we use a reported method in which the peak for
BHET is well resolved and MHET and TPA peaks show at the
same retention time (Figure S1).
[25]
The HPLC results (Figure 4A)
of a reference sample of untreated post-consumer PET sample
with no enzymatic treatment confirms that PET is not soluble in
water and methanol and no products were detected. Alter-
natively, we found that the NaOH treatment alone with no
enzymatic treatment only produces low quantities of MHET +
TPA 0.12 � 0.01 mM/g PET, note that a semi-log graph is
represented to enable a better comparison between the 4
samples. Under these mild conditions the NaOH treatment
releases PET oligomers, with a measured weight loss of about
5 %, but no elementary products such as TPA and EG are
detected by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, a technique able to
identify oligomers but less sensitive than HPLC. At this point it
is important to note that PET leads to complete hydrolysis using
a catalyst transfer and increasing the temperature to 90 ° C.
[26]
All
these results confirm that the kinetics of the hydrolysis reaction
using our alkali treatment at room temperature are very low.
Then, there is a need for the additional enzymatic treatment to
accelerate the degradation of consumer PET.
Enzymatic treatment of post-consumer PET with the PETase
was used directly on untreated PET. We obtained results within
reported values with mean MHET + TPA concentration of 0.25 �
0.11 mM/g PET during the first 24 h. This result agrees with a
production of MHET + TPA that depends on the crystallinity of
the substrate, see Table 1. Indeed, our results are lower than
those obtained using amorphous PET film with crystallinity of
2–3 %
[27]
but about 10-fold higher than those obtained by
PETase incubation with higher crystallinity bottles (~
45 %).
[23,28,29]
Here, it is important to mention that amorphous
PET is not relevant for consumer applications but the trend
illustrates the potential role of enzymatic degradation if the
enzymatic accessibility issue is circumvented. Therefore, we
highlight that PET crystallinity is a great determinant in the
efficacy of the enzymatic methods to degrade the polymer. In
our case, the untreated commercial PET bottle sample with
crystallinity of 33 % shows intermediate production of MHET +
TPA.
As expected from the surface analysis and crystallinity
results, we obtained best yields of MHET + TPA when the alkali
pre-treatment is combined with the PETase incubation, the
mean products concentration of 2.11 � 0.41 mM/g PET is
obtained during the first 24 h. Overall, the NaOH pre-treatment
increases the enzymatic activity by one order of magnitude as
compared to the sample that was untreated with NaOH. We
attribute this effect to the better access of the enzyme to the
hydrolysable bonds due to a reduction in the crystallinity of the
PET sample.
In order to evaluate the stability of the enzymes we
completed incubations over long periods of time (Figure 4B).
We observed that the production of TPA + MHET increased over
the 6 days incubation period. However, the accumulated
products (TPA + MHET) slows down during the following days.
The results are in good agreement with other studies with
incubation periods that were completed over 7
[22]
and 10
[23]
days. Our results suggest that the enzyme is still active up to
6 days, but it loses activity after 24 h.
To discuss the effectiveness of different strategies reported
to improve PET biodegradation, we show in Table 1 some
representative examples with detailed experimental conditions,
together with the reported/calculated yields of products (TPA +
MHET) after 24 h incubation time at 30 ° C. The limitation of this
general comparison is that, often, the yield is not reported, or
the publication lack the essential information to calculate it, i. e.
reaction volume or PET loading.
Plastics with high crystallinity show very low yields, that
PETase modifications or mutations do not improve significantly
(Entries 2–5). For example, the yield PET degradation was
increased 11 fold (a maximum yield of ~ 6 × 10
  3
%) by the
addition of alternating glutamic and lysine residues to the

PETase.
[28]
Also, addition of monomers onto the PETase could
increase 1.5-fold its activity to a maximum of 0.7 × 10
  3
%
yield.
[29]
Moreover, rational design of mutant PETase resulted in
more thermostable enzymes, the best of which gave a yield of
17.9 × 10
  3
% at 40 ° C by PETaseS121S, D186H, R280 A mutant.
This data indicates that, up to date, no enzyme modification or
mutation has obtained significant yields on postconsumer PET,
clearly supporting that pre-treatment is necessary.
In our study, alkali pre-treatment (Entry 6) increases degra-
dation to a yield of TPA + MHET in the range of 1 × 10
  2
% after
24 h. Although this yield is still very low, alkali pre-treatment is
not a high energy demanding process. Alternatively, PET
crystallinity can be reduced to 2 % (Entry 7) by two heating/
cooling cycles at 290 ° C,
[30]
this method involves large energy
consumption, making difficult to scale the process up for tons
of plastic waste. Other strategies chose to increase the surface
accessibility to enzymes. For instance, high crystalline powder
(Entry 8)
[22]
or post-consumer PET treated by ball milling
(Entry 9)
[31]
give a yield of approximately 2 % after 24 h
incubation with wild type PETase. Ball milling reduces postcon-
sumer plastic to a micron size particle powder, and should not
be mistaken with a general grinding process widely used in the
plastic recycling industry that reduces plastic waste to centi-
meters particles.
Ball milling is also a highly energy demanding treatment
which may not be easily applicable at large scale. In fact, the
reduction in particle size takes place by the large frictional
forces that occur internally during the process. Finally, novel
strategy to increase accessibility involves PET reduction to fibers
(Entry 10), followed by hydrophobins RolA (Aspergillus oryzae)
and HGFI (Grifola frondose) enzymes incubation prior to
PETase.
[32]
The pre-treatment with these enzymes notably
modify the surface of PET fibers, increasing the amorphous
regions for hydrolytic enzyme attack. In these conditions, up to
17.2 % yield is reported (14 mM TPA + MHET) in the first 24 h.
The method also relies on fibers of PET which would require
additional processes to produce them.
Conclusion
Our data supports that the proposed mild temperature alkali
pre-treatment modifies the surface of the substrate and reduces
the crystallinity of the PET substrates. Overall, the treatment
enables an efficient access of the PETase to the reactive
chemical bonds allowing an efficient chemical degradation of
the PET with formation of MHET and TPA. The method provides
reaction yields similar to other treatments more energy
intensive (heating/cooling cycles), therefore offering advantages
regarding its lower energy requirement and affordable chem-
icals (NaOH). As highlighted in this work none of the reported
degradation conditions (including our conditions) are yet
applicable to large scale of plastic waste treatment. Reported
degradation yields are low after 24 h of reaction when un-
treated high crystalline post-consumer plastic is used. This
study aligns with previous reports, supporting that effective
plastic recycling must include the combination of several
methodologies, chemical, physical and biological approaches.

Further optimization studies to combine large plastic surface
area and alkali pretreatment are warranted to design the
protocol that best suits PET waste effective management.
Experimental Section
Enzyme expression and purification: OverExpressTM E. coli C41
(DE3) (Lucigen) cells were transformed with pET21a(+) plasmid
constructed with PETase(GenScript Biotech). Single colonies were
inoculated into a starter culture of Luria Broth (LB) media
containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin and grown at 37 ° C, 250 rpm
overnight. Following day, the culture was inoculated at a 100-fold
dilution into a 2xYT medium containing 100 μg/mL ampicillin and
grown at 37 ° C until the optical density measured at 600 nM
(OD600) reached 0.6–0.8. Protein expression was induced by
addition of isopropyl β-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final
concentration of 0.5 mM. Bacteria were maintained at 20 ° C,
200 rpm for 18 hours following IPTG induction, harvested by
centrifugation ((5000 x g, 5 min, 4 ° C), and stored at   20 ° C until
purification. For protein isolation, bacterial pellets were resus-
pended in 2 mL of lysis buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, 0.5 M
NaCl, 10 mM Imidazole, pH 7.4) and lysed by sonication (15 min
with cycles of 10 s). Lysate was clarified by centrifugation at
20000 × g for 45 minutes at 4 ° C and applied to an immobilized
metal ion affinity column (IMAC) His SpinTrap columns (GE Health-
care). Protein was eluted with phosphate buffer, 500 mM Imidazole,
pH 7.4. The resulting fractions containing proteins of interest were
applied to a PD MiniTrap G-25 size exclusion (SEC) column (GE
Healthcare), equilibrated with 50 mM Glycine/NaOH pH 9.0. The
concentration and purity of the obtained proteins was assayed by
Nanodrop Spectrophotometer and sodium dodecyl sulfate-poly-
acrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), followed by silver
staining or transfer to membrane for Western blot using primary
antibody against the hexa-histidine epitope tag (Invitrogen).
NaOH pretreatment of PET-bottle: Plastic pieces of about 1 × 1 cm
2
are cut from a postconsumer PET bottle in the area 3–10 cm above
the base of the bottle (see Figure 1B). Untreated samples are
washed with distilled water and subsequently dried in a vacuum
oven for 20 h at 40 ° C and weighed. Samples subjected to alkali
treatment are immersed into NaOH (10 M) during 24 h at room
temperature, washed with distilled water, vacuum dried and
weighed.
Enzymatic degradation of PET: Untreated and NaOH pretreated
pieces were immersed in 200 μL glycine-NaOH buffer (50 mM,
pH 9.0) with purified enzymes (2 mg enzyme/g PET) at 30 ° C for 1–6
d. After centrifuging and filtering, the supernatant was applied to
HPLC for the determination of PET decomposition activity. The
released compounds were determined as the total concentrations
(μM) of MHET and TPA produced at different incubation times. PET
removed from the reaction solution was consecutively washed with
distilled water and subsequently vacuum dried for 20 h at 40 ° C for
scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation.
High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis: The
HPLC experiments were performed on an Agilent 1260 Infinity II
system equipped with a poroshell EC   C18 column at 35 ° C for the
analysis of aromatic products. The mobile phase contains water(A)/
methanol(B). The separation was carried out using a gradient
program of:
ðAÞ ¼ 99 % and ðBÞ ¼ 1 % at time t ¼ 0
ðAÞ ¼ 75 % and ðBÞ ¼ 25 % at time t ¼ 15
ðAÞ ¼ 0 % and ðBÞ ¼ 100 % at time t ¼ 25 min
ðAÞ ¼ 1 % and ðBÞ ¼ 99 % at time t ¼ 26:00 min
The flow rate was held constant at 1 mL min
  1
resulting in a run
time of 35 minutes. The aromatic products were detected by the
absorbance at 240 nm and recognized according to the retention
time of standard compounds. The concentration of each product
was calculated in accordance with the calibration curve which was
organized from the absorption peak area versus the standard
solution concentration. The R-squared values of the calibration
curves were at least 0.996.
Scanning electron microscopy: SEM measurements were carried
out in a JEOL 7001F equipment operating at 15 kV.
Crystallinity analyses by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC):
The crystallinity of untreated and NaOH pretreated PET was
measured by DSC (METTLER TOLEDO DSC2). Scans were equili-
brated at 0 ° C for 1 min, heated to 300 ° C at a heating rate of
10 ° C·min
  1
and maintained at 300 ° C for 1 min, then the sample
was cooled to 0 ° C at 10 ° C·min

carried out in nitrogen atmosphere. The crystallinity was calculated
