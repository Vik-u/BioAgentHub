Abstract
Plastic pollution in di ver se ter restrial and marine env ironments is a widely recognised and
g rowing problem. Bio‐recycling and upcycling of plastic w aste is a potential solution to
plastic pollution, as these processes conv er t plastic w aste into useful materials . P oly-
eth ylene terep hthalate (PET) is the most abundant plastic waste , and this material can be
deg raded by a class of recently disco ver ed bacterial esterase enzymes known as PET
hy drolases (PET ase). Inv estig ations of the enzymatic h ydrolysis of div erse PET molecules
ha ve clearly revealed that the biodeg radability of various PET substrates depends on both
their c hemical str ucture and physical proper ties , including polymer length, cr ystallinity ,
glass transition temperature, surface area, and surface charge. Thi s review summarises the
known impacts of cr ystallinity and other ph ysical propert ies on enzymatic PET
hy drolysis .

Th e ever‐increasing demand, indiscriminate production, and
widespread use of single‐use plastic items ha ve created a
w orldwide pollution problem, with g rowing amounts of plastic
w aste accum ulating in landfills and in natural environments
including marine and ter restrial ecosystems . Whilst resistance
to deg radation is an adva ntag e in cer tain applications , it is a
major cause of environment pollution as plastic waste s persist
and accum ulate. Studies ha ve estimated that around 33 billion
tons of discarded plastics will ha v e accum ulated on Ear th by
2050 [1]. P olyethylene terep hthalate (PET) is the most abun-
dant plastic with an estimated global production of 70 million
tons annually [2], and is widely used in disposable containers
for varieties of soft drinks , juices , and drinking water . Lik e
other plastics , PET is highly resistant to deg radation, and the
accum ulation of PET w aste in the env ironment is understood
as a global problem with ov er riding implications that requires
immediate and larg e‐scale inter ventions . Accordingly , sub-
stantial effor ts ha ve been focussed on recycling PET w aste.
Th er mal, c hemical, and mechanical processes ha v e been
develop ed for this pur pose , each with its pros and cons .
PET biodeg radation has been proposed in recent years as
an eco‐friendly recycling opport unity , par ticularly in light of
the ex citing disco ver ies of PET h ydrolase enzymes [3–6].
Viable g reen industrial bioprocesses for plastic recycling are
closer to realisation, with rapid adva ncement of researc h and
dev elopment on enzymatic PET hy drolysis [2, 7–9]. Enzyme
engineering has been employed to ov ercome the limited cata-
lytic efficiency of nativ e PET hy drolase enzymes [7, 10–13]. T o
date , most re por ted studies ha v e focussed on the disco v er y of
new PET hy drolase enzymes , understanding the enzyme
str ucture and reaction mechanisms , enzyme engineering ef-
forts , and bioprocess optimisation (for both nati ve and engi-
neered enzymes). Compared to the relativ ely extensiv e researc h
attention giv en to the protein str uctures and reaction mecha-
nisms of PET hy drolase enzymes , considerably fewer studies
ha v e inv estiga ted ho w the physical propert ies of PET sub-
strates impact the deg radation process . The few repor ts that

for PET substrates and considers their impacts on enzymatic
PET deg radation.
Enzymatic hy drolysis of post‐consumer PET materials is
extremely difficult due to their semi‐cr ystalline nature. Like
other polymers , PET has complex str uctures comprising both
cr ystalline and amorp hous regions . PET can exist in an
amorphous or semi‐cr ystalline state but not in a 100% cr ys-
talline for m [25] (Figure 1). The amorphous regions are
relativ ely flexible due to a disordered ar ray of the polymer
c hains whilst the cr ystalline regions ha ve extremely rigid
c hemical str uctures made up of closely pac k ed parallel poly-
mer c hains [26]. How ever , chain mobility increases dramati-
cally abov e glass transition temperature (Tg), a temperature
where the polymer experiences transition from a rigid state to
a more flexible state. Abo ve the Tg, PET substrates are more
susceptible to enzymatic hy drolysis as they become more
accessible to the PET hy drolase enzymes . Th e Tg of most
post‐consumer PET is ~70°C , and perfor ming PET hy dro-
lysis abov e this temperature could potentially be a g ame
c hanger with respect to efficiency [21]. Significant researc h
effort is focussed on finding ther mostable enzymes for PET
deg radation at high temperatures , although energ y effi-
ciency and sustainability of such processes is yet to be ev al-
uated [2, 3, 16, 22]. In addition, PET substrates ha ve been
pre‐treated to reduce their cr ystallinity , whic h also enhances
their accessibility to the enzyme [2, 14, 17].
Multiple studies re por t enzymatic hy drolysis using PET
substrates with a wide rang e of cr ystallinities . Ho w ever , direct
comparison of the results is not straightforward , as these
studies w ere car ried out using different reaction condi-
tions and reaction times (var ying from hours to several w eeks)
[2, 14, 15, 22, 23]. Th e ge neral trend sug g ests that enzymatic
h ydrolysis is enhanced with decreased cr ystallinity of PET
substrates , concur ring with the relativ ely flexible polymer
c hains in amorphous PET compared to the closely pac ked and
extremely rigid c hemical str ucture of the cr ystalline regions . T o
date , the vast majority of studies use PET films but the most
efficient enzymatic hy drolyses are re ported with PET micro-
particles and nanopart icles , whic h usually hav e little or no
cr ystallinity [2, 14].
T ournier et al. hav e ach ieve d the highest efficiency and the
fastest depolymerisation of post‐consumer PET w aste re-
ported to date. The y hav e shown 90% conv ersion of
amorphised and micronised (micro‐size PET part icles as a
result of a process to whic h the plastic films/bottles are
brok en do wn) post‐consumer PET ov er 10 h reaction at 72°C
using an engineered cutinase enzyme. Although the engi-
neered enzyme sho wed higher ther mostability and superior
acti vity o ver the wild‐type enzyme, micronisation and
amorphisation contributed to the results . Interestingly , the
wild‐type enzyme took 3 days to conv ert 31% of a PET
substrate with only 10% cr ystallinity at 65°C. Th e authors also
noted fast re‐cr ystallisation of the amorphised PET at higher
temperature, reach ing up to 37.5% cr ystallinity within 6 h at
75°C. Th is could be a major consideration in designing PET
deg radation studies at high temperatures closer to the glass
transition of PET . The authors also indicated that

micronisation is useful for larg e ‐ scale enzymatic PET recycling
as it enhances the accessibility of substrate to the enzyme by
increasing the surface area, thus accelerating the reaction rate.
In another interesting study , Cui et al . sho w ed that
decreased cr ystallinity and decreased par ticle size ha v e been
shown to enhance the efficiency of enzymatic PET hy drolysis .
Th ey re ported 100% deg radation of PET microplastics (0.1–
1 mm diameter) and nanoplastics (50–100 nm diameter) using
a ther mostable Is PET ase v ariant named ‘DuraPET ase’ that w as
develop ed using a computation ‐ based protein engineering tool
[ 14 ]. Th e complete deg radation of PET nanoplastics w as
ach ieved within one hour compared to 2 weeks for deg rading
the microplastics using the wild ‐ type enzyme. How ever , the
same enzyme hy drolysed only 15% of PET film (8 mm coupon
diameter) with 30% cr ystallinity ov er a 10 ‐ day reaction. All
reactions were car ried out at 37°C , despite the DuraPET ase
varia nt retaining acti vity at muc h higher temperatures . The
ther mostability allows for longer reaction time at the milder
temperature. The results clearly sug g est that cr ystallinity and
part icle size play important roles in the efficiency of enzymatic
PET hy drolysis . Another muta nt Is PET ase designed using a
bioinfor matic approach sho wed a 10.4°C higher melting
temperature than that of the wild ‐ type enzyme [ 17 ]. The
muta nt enzyme w as 40 ‐ fold more acti ve than the wild ‐ type on
the amorp hised PET bottle , and it was able to deg rade > 16%
of a pre ‐ treated Coca Cola bottle film with cr ystallinity reduced
from 29.2% to 10.7%. Ho w ever , the authors did not mention
deg radation of untreated bottle by the enzyme, presumably due
to inactivity of the enzyme on this substrate. Puspitasari et al .
compared enzymatic deg radation of semi ‐ cr ystalline PET fi-
bres and high ‐ cr ystalline PET pow der using the Is PET ase
enzyme with and without hy drophobin treatment. Th e results
sho w ed significant increase in enzymatic hy drolysis of both
PET substrates when pre ‐ treated with hy drophobins; a higher
con version w as ach ieve d for PET fibres compared to PET
po w der substrate [ 18 ]. Although the pow der had a higher
surface area, the authors attributed higher conv ersion of PET
fibres to their low er cr ystallinity and concluded that enzymatic
PET h ydrolysis is influenced more by cr ystallinity than the
surface area of the substrate .
Th e influence of cr ystallinity on cutinase ‐ catalysed PET
h ydrolysis has been directly compared using low ‐ cr ystallinity
PET (lcPET , 7% cr ystallinity) and biaxially oriented PET
(boPET , 35% cr ystallinity) substrates , and three different
cutinases from Humilica insolens (HiC), Pseudomonas men-
docina (PmC), and Fusarium solani (FsC) [ 19 ]. About 10 ‐ fold
higher enzymatic hy drolysis w as obser v ed on the lcPET
compared to the boPET substrate, although the optim um re-
action conditions and catalytic efficiencies var y from one
enzyme to another . HiC , PmC and FsC show ed 25 ‐ , 10 ‐ , and
6 ‐ fold higher initial activities , respecti vely , on the lcPET sub-
strate ov er boPET . In another study , higher h ydrolytic acti vity
of FsC tow ards amorphous PET was demonstrated using three
PET substrates: amorphous PET film (4.1% cr ystallinity),
g ranula r PET (13.7% cr ystallinity) and biaxially oriented PET
film (48.2% cr ystallinity) [ 24 ]. V er y small amounts of
FIGURE 1 P olyethylene terephthalate (PET) biodeg radation is catalyzed by the enzyme PET ase (repres ented by PDB ID 6IL W). The activity is influenced
by the physical ch aracteristics of the PET substrates including glass transition temperature, cr ystallinity , and particle for mats and sizes (e.g ., bulk, films ,
microplastics , nanoplastics)

deg radation products were detected from the biaxially oriented
PET after a 5‐da y reaction at 30°C temperature and pH 8.0. In
similar reaction settings , 10‐fold more enzymatic hy drolysis of
amorp hous PET was achiev ed compared to g ranular PET
despite the higher surface area of the latter . This obser v ation
also sug g ests that cr ystallinity pla ys a more import ant role in
enzymatic PET hy drolysis than surface area.
Fur ukaw a et al. demonstrated improv ed enzymatic hy dro-
lysis of low ‐cr ystalline (3%–5% cr ystallinity) and high‐cr ystalline
(40% cr ystallinity) PET substrates after pre‐treatment with
surfactants [15, 16]. Binding of anionic (TfCut2) and cationic
(IsPET ase) enzymes on the PET film surface was impro ved by
pre‐treatment with cationic and anionic surfactants , respectiv ely ,
whic h resulted in significant improv ement of enzymatic PET
hy drolysis . Improv ement of IsPET ase acti vity by 120‐fold and
13‐fold for TfCut2 w as ach ieved for deg radation of low ‐
cr ystalline PET . Activ ities also improv ed for high‐cr ystalline
PET deg radation but to a low er extent. F or both enzymes ,
PET deg radation rate for low‐cr ystalline PET w as >100‐fold
higher than high‐cr ystalline PET ir respecti ve of the surfactant
treatment.
In contrast to the abo ve‐mentioned studies , many others
ha ve repor ted that enzymatic PET hy drolysis using commer-
cial PET films without any significant pre‐treatment results in
very little deg radation [7, 10, 12]. A ustin et al. re ported an
IsPET ase muta nt (S238F/W159H) with a nar ro w er cleft at its
acti ve site that show ed increased substrate affinity and
improv ed PET deg radation compared to wild‐type PET ase [7].
Ho wev er , the studies were car ried out using a PET coupon
with 14.8% cr ystallinity and the acti vity w as expressed in ter ms
of ‘% cr ystallinity c hange ’ and support ed by SEM images .
Notably , identical m utations ha ve been repor ted in other
studies , support ing the functional relevance of these mutations
[10, 11]. Shirk e et al. ach ieved 95% w eight loss of a low ‐
cr ystalline PET film (7% cr ystallinity) using a leaf and
branch compost cutinase (LCC) v ariant while Sulaiman et al.
(2014) re por ted ∼ 30% w eight loss of another PET film
(cr ystallinity not mentioned) using the wild‐type LCC enzyme.
Shi et al. (2021) used a combination of SEM imaging of PET
film and quantification of PET po wder deg radation products
to characterise PET depoly merisation by a secreted recombi-
nant IsPET ase enzyme. Son et al. develop ed ther mostable
IsPET ase variants and re ported several mutant enzymes [22].
Th e S121E/D186H/R280A mutant sho w ed an 8.81 °C higher
T m v alue and 14‐fold higher acti vity tow ards 41% cr ystalline
PET film ov er the wild‐type enzyme. The quadr uple mutant
S121E/D186H/S242T/N246D sho wed 1 °C higher T m ov er
the triple mutant S121E/D186H/R280A and 58‐fold higher
acti vity for PET bottle hy drolysis compared to the wild‐type
enzyme.
PET hy drolysis is especially c hallenging owi ng to its
extreme resistance to both biotic as well as abiotic deg radation
[27]. The resistance stems from its ph ysical propert ies which
can be abated by vario us pre‐treatment processes that alter the
physic al propert ies of the material, making it more susceptible
to enzymatic deg radation. Micronisation, amorp hisation,
surface‐coating, and/or par tial dep olymerisation by
ph ysicoch emical pre‐treatment are promising, but challenges
associated with the pre‐treatment process (including energ y
efficacy , cost effectiv eness , and viability in larg e scale) need to
be carefully assessed when considering the economic viability
of PET bio‐recycling . Th e quest to find the optimal PET
deg rading enzymes is rapidly evo lving with primar y focus on
enzyme engineering for impro ved deg radation of PET plastics .
Ho w ever , efforts tow ards identifying PET substrate mor-
phologies and g reen pre‐treatment processes are lack ing .
Cur rent evidence sug ge sts that par ticle properties such as
cr ystallinity , surface area, and surface charge contribute
significantly to PET deg radation. The path tow ards the
dev elopment of industrially viable biodeg radation platfor ms
will, therefore , require a unison betw een the highly efficient
enzymes and optimized pre‐processing steps to ov ercome the
inherent recalcitrance of PET .
