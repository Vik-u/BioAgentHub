1 INTRODUCTION
The combination of mass production of single-use plas-
ticproducts,plasticlongevity,andinsufficientwasteman-
agement has resulted in an accumulation of plastic in
the environment over the last few decades [1]. Glob-
ally, approximately 368 million tons of plastic were pro-
ducedin2019alone[ 2].Polyethyleneterephthalate(PET),
a semi-crystalline thermoplastic composed of the two
monomericunitsterephthalicacid(TA)andethylenegly-
col (EG), linked by ester bonds, is one of the mass-
producedpetroleum-basedsyntheticpolymers[ 3,4].More
than 50 million tons of PET are annually produced glob-
ally, with the main applications being synthetic fibers in
thetextileindustryandbeveragebottlesinthepackaging
sector[5,6].
Recyclingisaviabledisposalsolutionforexistingplas-
tic waste in terms of energy savings, material efficiency
and circularity, for which the use of enzymes can be an
alternative option [7]. PET has hydrolysable ester back-
bonesandisthusmoresusceptibletoenzymaticdegrada-
tionthanpetrochemicalvinylplasticswithsolelycarbon-
carbon backbones [8, 9]. Several enzymes capable of
cleaving PET have been discovered in recent years [10].
These PET hydrolases belong to the enzyme classes of
carboxylesterases [11], lipases [12] and cutinases [13–16].
Whencomparedtochemicalrecyclingmethods,theuseof
enzymesprovidesanenvironmentallyfriendlyandenergy-
saving alternative that also reduces the use of hazardous
chemicals [7]. Although the industrially-relevant use of
enzymes in PET degradation is still in its early stages, an
engineered variant of the leaf-branch compost cutinase
(LCC) has already enabled nearly complete depolymer-
ization of pre-treated PET bottle waste and virgin poly-
mers were re-synthesized using the recovered TA [17]. A
significant milestone in PET breakdown was the identi-
fication of the Gram-negative aerobicβ-proteobacterium
Ideonella sakaiensis by screening of 250 environmental
samplesobtainedfromaPETbottlerecyclingsiteinJapan
[18]. The bacterium utilized PET as its main energy and
carbonsource,anditwasabletogrowonlow-crystallinity
PET film and degrade it almost completely after 6 weeks
at an incubation temperature of 30◦C under controlled
laboratory conditions [18]. Two enzymes, designated as
IsPETase andIsMHETase, are involved in the breakdown
ofPETby Ideonellasakaiensis [18].IsPETasecatalyzesthe
depolymerization of PET to the main product mono-(2-
hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET) and the side prod-
ucts bis-(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), TA, and
EG[18].IsMHETasethenhydrolyzesMHETtoTAandEG
[18].
In recent years, the crystal structures ofIsPETase and
IsMHETase have been elucidated and published [19–25].
PRACTICALAPPLICATION
In this work, an error-prone PCR-generated
mutant library was screened using an agar
plate assay based on the commercially available
polyester-polyurethane Impranil DLN W 50.
With this type of screening, finding multiple
thermostable polyester hydrolase variants within
a mutant library was possible. Recycling plastics
such as PET with enzymes is one of the recently
developed methods to mitigate the plastic pollu-
tion and to promote the circularity of material
flowforasustainable plastic economy.Theenzy-
matic degradation of polyethylene terephthalate
is more feasible at higher incubation tempera-
tures.Therefore,mesophilicenzymessuchasthe
IsPETase from Ideonella sakaiensis need to be
engineered, revealing higher thermostability and
activity by protein engineering methods such as
directedevolution.
Despitethis,onlyone IsPETasestructurehasbeensolved
so far with a co-crystallized ligand analogous to MHET
[19].IsPETaseexhibitsatypical α/β-hydrolasefoldconsist-
ingofseven α-helicesandnine β-strandsformingacentral
twisted β-sheet [21], which is highly conserved among
many other cutinase-like PET-hydrolyzing enzymes [26].
The catalytic triad ofIsPETase, located on the protein
surface, is composed of the amino acids S160-D206-H237
[22].Theenzymehastwointramoleculardisulfidebridges,
whereas the structurally homologous cutinases TfCut2
from Thermobifida fusca and LCC only have one [19,
27]. The strictly conserved disulfide bridge (C273-C289)
connects the last loop and the C-terminal helix [19]. The
IsPETase-specific disulfide bridge (C203-C239) is located
neartheactivesiteandconnectstwoloopscontainingthe
residuesofthecatalytictriad[ 19].Thisdisulfidebridgeis
thought to be responsible for the high room temperature
flexibility of theIsPETase active site and the resulting
highactivityagainstPET[ 27].Methodssuchasstructure-
based sequence alignment ofIsPETase with structural
homologues or molecular docking experiments followed
by biochemical characterization have also contributed to
the elucidation of important residues in the enzyme [19,
20, 23, 24]. For example, a tryptophan residue crucial for
substrate binding was discovered inIsPETase [19]. This
amino acid W185 is located near the catalytic center and
can adopt three different conformations, which is why
it is also referred as a wobbling tryptophan [19, 23]. In
a proposed substrate binding, W185 formsπ-π-stacking

interactions with the phenylene units of PET, allowing
interactionswiththesubstrateandfacilitatingbinding[ 19,
23].ThewobblingofW185in IsPETaseisbasedonaserine
at position 214 and an isoleucine at 218, which allow the
tryptophan to rotate [28]. In homologous enzymes, these
serine and isoleucine residues are replaced by histidine
or phenylalanine, respectively, restricting the movement
of the tryptophan and thus lowering the activity for PET
degradation[28].

mesophilic enzyme with a melting point (Tm) of approx-
imately45◦C,anditisthusthermallyunstableforapplica-

In order to achieve effective PET degradation by
IsPETase, the activity and thermostability of the enzyme
has been improved by protein engineering in previous
studies [19, 20, 22–24]. For instance, an improvement of
IsPETaseactivitywasachievedbytheR280Asubstitution
[20]. Docking studies showed that the polar arginine
residue in the binding pocket ofIsPETase hinders stable
binding of PET, therefore the substitution of the arginine
residue by small hydrophobic amino acid residues leads
toincreasedactivity[ 20].Sonetal.generatedan IsPETase

of thermostability and hydrolytic activity against PET

sion in Escherichia coli , encoding the wild-type
IsPETase from I. sakaiensis , DuraPETase, and
DuraPETaseK95N/S121E/D186H/F201I, were synthesized

2.2 ScreeningbasedonImpranilagar
plates
ImpranilDLNW50agarplateswereusedforthescreen-
ing of the IsPETaseTM mutant library. The lysogeny
broth (LB) agar plates contained 0.5 mM isopropyl-β-d-
thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG), 100μgm L−1 ampicillin,
and 0.5% Impranil DLN W 50, diluted from a 40% sus-
pension.Themutantlibrarywasusedtotransformchem-
ically competentE. coliSHuffle T7 Express (New Eng-
land Biolabs GmbH, Frankfurt am Main, Germany) cells
which were then spread onto LB agar plates containing
100 μgm L−1 ampicillin. After the cells were incubated
overnightat30 ◦C,colonieswerepickedandtransferredto
anotherLB-ampicillinagarplate(storageplate)andinpar-
allel to the Impranil agar plate (assay plate). The storage
and assay plates were first incubated overnight at 30◦C,
the assay plates were subsequently incubated at 60◦Cf o r
24 h. Degradation of Impranil leads to formation of clear
zonesaroundcoloniesexpressingactive IsPETasevariants.
An increased size of the haloes formed, relative to the
TM as control, was used as a preliminary indication of
increased thermostability. Selected colonies were picked
fromthestorageplateandusedtoinoculateanovernight

thermostability was then experimentally verified by pro-
tein expression, purification and nanoDSF, as described

3 RESULTS
3.1 Screeningforthermostable
IsPETasevariants
Approximately 49,000 clones were screened on Impranil
agar plates, accounting for approximately∼52% of the
error-prone PCR-based mutant library with ∼95,000
clones. IsPETase activity was assessed by observing the
halo formation around the bacterial colony. At higher
incubation temperatures (≥60◦C), the size of the clear
zoneswasthoughtbedependentonthethermostabilityof
therecombinantvariants.Fourcolonieswithsignificantly
increased halo sizes, compared to that of the TM, were
selectedforfurtherexperiments.ThesewereTM K95N/F201I,
TMS125N/A226T,T MQ119L and TMT51A/S125I/S207I (Figure S1).
Based on structural analysis ofIsPETase (FigureS2), six
substitutions were present on the surface of the TM. In
contrast, the F201I mutation was located deeply inside
theenzyme.Afterexpressionandpurification(Figure S3),
the Tm of these four variants as well as the wild-type
IsPETase (WT) and TM were determined by nanoDSF
(Figure 1A). For WT and TM,Tm of 45.1◦Ca n d5 6 . 6◦C,
respectively, were measured. Most of the variants dis-
playedanimprovementin Tm ofapproximately2 ◦Ccom-
pared to TM (TableS2). The most thermostable variant
wasIsPETaseTMK95N/F201I (TM1)withanincreased Tm of
61.7◦Cwhichis5.3 ◦Chigherthanthatof IsPETaseTM.
3.2 Engineeringofmorethermostable
IsPETasevariants
With the aim of generating further more thermostable
variants, the most promising stabilizing K95N and F201I
substitutionswereincorporatedintopreviouslypublished
IsPETasevariantsincluding IsPETaseTMN233C/S282C(TM2)
andDuraPETase(D).For DuraPETasevariants,theS121E
andR280Asubstitutionswerealsoinvestigatedsimultane-
ously, since these substitutions in combination with the
K95N and F201I substitution led to the highTm in the
discovered TM1 variant. At the same time the influence
of the N233C and S282C substitutions, which were previ-
ouslydescribedbyZhong-Johnsonetal.[ 35]exclusivelyfor
theIsPETaseTM,werealsoinvestigatedwith DuraPETase.
Afterexpressionandpurification,the Tm wasdetermined
via nanoDSF for selectedIsPETase variants (Figure1B).

teine residues, theTm of DuraPETase variants were fur-
ther increased, to 81.1◦Cf o rDuraPETaseN233C/S282C (D1)
and78.4◦Cfor DuraPETaseK95N/S121E/F201I/N233C/R280A/S282C
(D3).Consequently, Tm hasbeenincreasedby36.1 ◦Cfrom
45.1◦Ct o8 1 . 1◦C for D1 compared to the WT by incorpo-
ratingthepreviouslyreportedN233CandS282Csubstitu-
tions.
3.3 InfluenceofsubstitutionsonPET
nanoparticleandamorphousPETfilm
hydrolysis
ThehydrolysisofPETnanoparticleswithaforementioned
IsPETase variants was investigated at different tempera-
tures ranging from 30◦Ct o6 0◦C for 24 h. With increas-
ing temperature, an increased degradation rate of PET
nanoparticlesintermsofhigherproductreleasecouldbe
observed for each variant (Figure2). A notably improved
performance in PET hydrolysis was observed with all
variants when the incubation temperature was increased
from 30◦Ct o4 0◦C. Even the WT showed increased
activity at higher temperatures, although theTm is only
45◦C( T a b l e2) and the overall yield of degradation prod-
ucts was markedly lower than with the other variants.
Comparing the TM related variants, it can be observed
that the introduction of the K95N and F201I substitu-
tion into the existing TM2 variant as well as into the TM
resulted in a decrease in total product release, defined

at 50◦C a reduction in the relative activity of only 30%

at 60◦C for TM and TM1. At this incubation tempera-
ture, an 8-fold enhancement was observed for TM1 in
relative activity compared with wild-typeIsPETase (Fig-
ure3)makingTM1possessingthesecondlargestincrease
after TM2. Mostproductformation was observedat 60◦C

The main product formed during the hydrolysis of PET
nanoparticles was MHET (FigureS4). TA and very low
BHETconcentrationswerealsodetected.
ThedegradationofamorphousPETfilmwascarriedout
atanincubationtemperatureof60 ◦Cfor72h.Underthese
conditions,almostnoproductformationwasobservedfor
WT. Except for D2, almost all thermostable variants led
to higher total product concentration when compared to
unstable variants like TM (Figure4). In addition, higher
relative activities than TM were observed for all variants
exceptforWTandD2(Table S4).Surprisingly,comparedto
thedegradationperformanceobtainedwithPETnanopar-
ticles, the combination variant (TM3) exhibited one of
the highest relative activities compared to WT (120-fold
increase, Figure4) and TM (10 to 20-fold increase, Table
S4). The highest total product was yielded with D1 and
the TM3 variant. However, unlike the hydrolysis of PET
nanoparticles, the main product this time was TA rather
thanMHET(Figure 5).
4 DISCUSSION
Screening methods based on agar plate assays containing
PET or polycaprolactone nanoparticles have been devel-
opedtoidentifypolyesterasesfrommetagenomiclibraries
[41]. However, these nanoparticles can precipitate during
agar plate preparation, interfering with uniform distribu-

theprotein.Avarietyofinteractions,suchasionicinterac-
tions, disulfide bonds, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic
interactions, affect the flexibility and thus the thermosta-
bility of the protein [42]. An increase in stability can be
mediated either by stabilization of the folded form or by
destabilization of the unfolded form [43]. The substitu-
tion of an amino acid must thereby affect the folded and
unfolded forms differently [43]. Finding an explanation
forincreasedthermostabilityisthereforeusuallyverydif-
ficult.

However,thecomputationallypredictedsinglemutations
S125RandA226PforWTdidnotcauseanincreaseoreven
adecreasein Tm asreportedbyCuietal.[ 37].Theimpact
ofasubstitutionishighlydependentonthetypeandnum-
ber of mutations already present in an enzyme [44]. This
could also be the reason for the lack of an increase and
the decrease inTm observed for theDuraPETase vari-
ants, which already contain the K95N/S121E/F201I and
R280A substitutions. The K95 position was already eval-
uated in the publication reportingDuraPETase, where a
K95A mutation only led to an increase of 2.5◦Ci nTm
for the WT [37]. The K95N substitution could have the
sameinfluenceonthethermostabilityastheK95Asubsti-
tution,additionalincreaseinthermostabilitywouldpossi-
blyresultfromtheF201Isubstitution.
Theintroductionofadditionaldisulfidebridgesintoan
enzyme is one possible strategy to increase thermostabil-
ity [43]. The main goal of these cross-links is to reduce
BROTTetal. 201
theflexibilityofcertainthermolabilefolds[ 43].Crosslink-
ing results in a reduced entropic state during the unfold-
ing process, shifting the equilibrium toward the folded
form[43].Theselectionofthecorrectpositionsforamino
acid substitution is crucial, the substitution should have
no effect on the catalytic properties of the enzyme. For
theidentificationofsuitablepositionsfordisulfidebridges
inPETdegradingenzymes,thestructuresofhomologous
cutinases can be helpful [17, 45] .F o rC u t 1 9 0f r o mSac-
charomonosporaviridis,whichishomologousto IsPETase
[35],the Tm couldbeincreasedbymorethan20 ◦Cthrough
replacingcalcium-bindingsiteswithdisulfidebridges[ 45].
This led, for instance, to the discovery of the N233C and
S282C substitutions inIsPETase [35]. However, since no
crystalstructurewasdescribedforthe IsPETaseN233C/S282C
variant, itcanonlybespeculatedontheformationofthe
disulfidebridgeinthe IsPETasevariants.Inthisstudythe
insertion of the N233C and S282C substitutions into the
DuraPETasealsoledtoanincreasein Tm ofapproximately
6.1◦C. This D1 variant revealed indeed the highestTm of
81.1◦Camongthesofardescribed IsPETasevariants.
At higher incubation temperatures, a higher product
release was observed in most cases for the thermostabi-
lizedIsPETasevariants.Astheflexibilityoftheamorphous
polymerchainswillsignificantlyincreaseattemperatures
close to theTg of PET, better enzymatic degradation per-
formance can be expected [16, 29]. Increased thermosta-
bilityisthereforeadvantageousforthe IsPETase-catalyzed
degradation of PET. A good example in this study is the
comparison of the TM and TM1 variants. In the degrada-
tionofPETnanoparticles,theTMvariantshowedahigher
total product formation at 40◦C than TM1. This variant
alsopossessedonlyarelativeactivityof30.4%comparedto
TMatthisincubationtemperature.Onlywhenthedegra-
dation was carried out at 60◦C, a similar relative activity
wasobservedbetweenTMandTM1(Table S3).Theinflu-
ence on PET degradation due to increased thermostabil-
ity is better observed for the TM1 variant when degrad-
ing amorphous PET film. There, this variant showed an
approximately two-fold increase in relative activity com-
paredtoTM(Table S4).SinceTMonlyhasaT m of56.5◦C,
it is highly probable that this variant is inactivated much
fasterovertheperiodof72hthanTM1andthereforeless
productwasreleased(Figure 4).
For variants containing the K95N and F201I substitu-
tions, low activities for hydrolysis of PET nanoparticles
wereobserved.TheaminoacidF201islocatedinadeeply
hiddenhydrophobiccoreof IsPETase,whichadditionally
consistsofpositionsW97,L101,M157,L199,L230,W257and
M258 [37]. Potentially, the F201I substitution has a struc-
turalinfluenceontheactivesite,sinceD206islocatedonly
five amino acid residues away from this substitution. By
contrast,thehighthermostabilityofTM4(T m=70.8◦C)in
combination with the prolonged incubation time of 72 h
mayberesponsiblefortheincreasedproductreleaseinthe
degradation of amorphous PET film. Only the D1 variant
withthe Tm of81.1◦Cpossessedasimilarrelativeactivityto
TM4.Bothvariantssupporttheprinciplethatanincreased
Tm brings a substantial advantage for the degradation of
PET.
MHETwasformedasthemainproductofPETnanopar-
ticle hydrolysis. This is consistent with the observations
by Yoshida et al. who also showed that MHET was the
major product forIsPETase-catalyzed hydrolysis of PET
[18]. According to Yoshida et al., degradation of MHET
by IsPETase should not be possible [18]. However, in the
degradationofamorphousPETfilm,TAisthemainprod-
uct, since MHET is degraded byIsPETase with extended
incubation time. The same reaction has already been
described elsewhere [46]. A prolonged incubation of the
PETathightemperaturescanleadtoaslowtransformation
of mobile amorphous fractions to rigid amorphous frac-
tions, which are less degradable by the enzyme [16]. This
processiscalledphysicalagingandcanthereforebecon-
sideredasacompetitivereactiontotheenzymaticdegrada-
tionoftheamorphousPET[ 16].SinceanamorphousPET
filmhasmuchlessaccessiblesurfaceareaandmuchlonger
polymer chains compared to the PET nanoparticles [47],
IsPETase and its variants, which cannot take part in the
effective degradation of the polymers, will be more likely
to degrade the MHET. This effect is further enhanced by
theprolongedincubationtimeof72h.Onlyverylowcon-
centrationsofBHETwereobservedforeachvariantinbio-
catalysis(Figure S4).Itisknownthat IsPETasecancatalyze
thehydrolysisofBHETtoTAandEG[ 18].
Several more thermostable IsPETase variants were
discovered in this study. Higher thermostability could
also be achieved by combination of four stabilizing sub-
stitutions with already promising published variants. For
the effective degradation of PET by enzymes, the right
balance between hydrolytic activity and thermostability
is essential. As demonstrated with IsPETase variants
containing the K95N and F201I substitutions, even a
slightlynegativeinfluenceofamutationontheactivityof
PET hydrolysis can be compensated by the simultaneous
increase ofTm for degradation reaction at higher incuba-
tiontemperatures.Thisledtoanimprovedeffectivenessin
PET degradation by theseIsPETase variants. An increase
inthermostabilityispossiblyaccompaniedbyanincrease
inrigidity[ 42]whichmaycauseanactivityreduction[ 48].
Specifically, for PET degradation, the enzymatic activity
loss may be compensated by the increased polymer sub-
strate accessibility at higher temperatures. Nonetheless,
thermostabilized IsPETase variants without significant
loss of hydrolytic activity will be of greater interest. The
