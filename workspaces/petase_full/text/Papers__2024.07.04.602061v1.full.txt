Abstract 
 
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) accounts for ≈6% of global plastic production, contributing considerably 
to the global solid waste stream and environmental plastic pollution. Since the discovery of PET -
depolymerizing enzymes, enzymatic PET recycling has been regarded as a promising method for plastic 
disposal, particularly in  the context of a circular economy  strategy. However, as the PET degrading 
enzymes developed so far suffer from relatively limited thermostability, low catalytic efficiency, as well as 
degradation intermediate -induced inhibition , t heir large scale industrial applications  are still largely 
hampered. To overcome these limitations, we used in silico  protein design methods to develop an 
engineered Leaf-branch Compost Cutinase (LCC), named DRK3, that features enhanced thermal stability 
and PETase activity relative to the current gold standard LCC enzyme (LCC-ICCG). DRK3 features a 4.1°C 
increase in melting temperature relative to  the LCC -ICCG enzyme. Under optimal reaction conditions 
(68°C), the DRK3 enzyme hydrolyze s amorphous PET material into TPA with a 2-fold higher efficiency 
compared to LCC-ICCG. Owing to its enhanced properties, DRK3 may be a promising candidate for future 
applications in industrial PET recycling processes.

Introduction 
Worldwide plastic production reached 390 million metric tons in 2021, of which 90.2% comes from fossil-
based production and only the remaining 9.8% comes from post-consumer plastic recycling or bio-based 
plastics.1 This massive production and usage of plastics, along with their very long persistence in the 
environment, has led to an extreme global pollution threat, especially in marine environments.2–5  
Polyethylene terephthalate (PET), the most abundant synthetic polyester in the environment, has an 
average lifetime of 25–50 years and accounts for 6.2% of the total plastic production.1 It is widely used in 
the production of textile fibers and resins for single -use beverage bottles and packaging. Polyethylene 
terephthalate is a thermoplastic polymer that is composed of terephthalic acid (TPA) and ethylene glycol 
(EG) subunits. Nowadays, PET is, to a large extent, mechanically recycled,  a process that results in a 
significant loss of the material’s properties and value .6 Harsh chemical treatments involving  the use of 
sulfuric acid at 150 °C or carried out under alkaline conditions in the presence of hazardous chemical 
catalysts (e.g., methyltrioctylammonium bromide) are also used, leading to the depolymerization of PET 
into its monomeric building blocks via ester bonds cleavage. However, the use of such harsh conditions 
makes it problematic to expand this treatment on a large scale. 
In 1977, Tokiwa and Suzuki proposed to use lipase enzymes to degrade polymeric materials .7 Indeed, 
enzymes work in mild conditions and can replace hazardous chemicals, a concept known as green 
chemistry. The first report of an efficient PET hydrolase (from Thermobifida fusca) was published in 2005.8 
Since then, numerous thermally stable PET hydrolases and their related enzymes from the cutinase group 
(EC. 3.1.1.74) have been identified in different organisms9–13. The search for thermostable PET hydrolases 
is driven by the fact that PET can be more effectively hydrolyzed at temperatures close to  its glass 
transition temperature ( ≈70-80°C in air, ≈60-70°C in water). Near the glass transition temperature, the 
polymer chains become more flexible, enabling PET hydrolases to function optimally. In 2016, Yoshida et 
al.14 reported on a mesophilic bacterium (Ideonella sakaiensis) that can thrive on an amorphous PET film 
as its primary carbon source already at 30°C, making the enzyme responsible for PET hydrolysis (IsPETase) 
the best option for PET waste decomposition. This work spurred a great deal of interest and several efforts 
in providing enhanced IsPETase mutants. However, since IsPETase is heat-labile, the enzyme quickly loses 
its activity at temperatures above 40°C. Therefore, more suitable scaffolds have also been explored, such 
as for instance the Leaf -branch Compost Cutinase (LCC), a naturally occurring PETase that has been 
reported to outperform all other known PET -degrading enzymes and to present a melting temperature 
(Tm) of 84.7°C. This enzyme has been noticeably engineered in 2020 by Tournier et al.,15 leading to the so-
called ICCG variant (also known as LCC-ICCG), which, in two different accounts, is reported to feature a Tm 
of 91.7 or 94.0°C (Table 1).

To the best of our knowledge, this variant is currently considered to be the gold standard PETase enzyme. 
Despite its remarkable stability, the sequence space for even a small enzyme like LCC is astounding (20293 
or 10381 theoretical possible sequences), leaving room to search for even more stable and active enzymes. 
Here, we set out to design improved PETase enzymes starting from the LCC-ICCG variant and using design 
strategies similar to those that we used previously with other classes of enzymes .25–28 Our working 
hypothesis is that improving the thermal stability would be beneficial for the PETase enzym atic activity, 
as observed in notable examples (IsPETase < LCC < LCC-ICCG). For this reason, we set out to improve LCC-
ICCG thermal stability, expecting further beneficial effects such as for instance higher expression yield and 
enhanced enzymatic activity.  
The field of computational design of thermostable proteins is relatively mature, with several established 
available methods that can help to generate a library of mutants and rank them. The easiest and more 
common approach involves the introduction of one or more  disulphide bonds, which can rigidify the 
backbone of the protein and make it more stable. Other stabilization methods generally aim at extending 
the intramolecular hydrogen bonding network, creating inter-molecular salt-bridges, or providing a better 
packing of the hydrophobic core (e.g., PROSS ).29 The Rosetta Supercharge method is meant to improve 
the stability of the protein by making the surface more hydrophilic, a feature that is usually  associated 
with more stable proteins.30    
While these methods are fast and have been successfully used, most of them use an implicit solvent model 
(i.e., the solvent is modelled with a continuum rather than with explicit atoms) and assume a rigid 
backbone (which may limit the long range structural effects of a mutation). To overcome these limitations, 
we included a further computational filter based on Molecular Dynamics simulations in explicit water. By 
using an orthogonal method, we aimed at screening and ranking on a common platform the most 
promising mutants generated by the methods described above.  
Our efforts led to the development of three variants that feature Tm values higher than any other PETase 
known to date and, for one of them (DRK3), further enhanced catalytic activity.

Results and Discussion 
In silico design and selection of stabilizing mutants 
In the first stage of our in silico enzyme engineering campaign, starting from the LCC-ICCG crystal structure 
(PDB code 6THS) we used three different protein design tools to generate a library of potentially stabilized 
enzyme variants. The use of the Rosetta Supercharge method,30 which aimed at increasing the charge on 
the surface of the enzyme, led to the design of 1000 enzyme variants, from which those 10 that featured 
the best Rosetta score (which we named C01 -C10) were selected for further analysis. PROSS design 29 
produced 9 variants (P01 -P09), and disulfide bond design 31 identified 125 enzyme variants, from which 
we selected the best 10, named X01-X10.  
The 29 candidate enzyme variants originating from the different screening methods were then subject to 
1 μs molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in explicit water and ranked based on their stability as assessed 
by RMSF analysis.25 Our MD-based ranking led to the selection of six candidate mutants ( C08, C09, P06, 
P08, X05, X09) for experimental production and characterization (Figure 1, Figure S1 and Table 2).

Thermal stability 
The six candidate enzymes were expressed in E.coli and purified. The final yields of all the enzymes were 
around 16 mg/liter of bacterial culture . Wild type LCC, a naturally occurring PETase , has a Tm of 84.7 °C. 
This enzyme has been previously engineered by Tournier et al. ,15 leading to the LCC-ICCG variant with a 
reported Tm of 94.0°C (92.9 °C in our own assessment, a difference that could be attributed to that fact 
that, for Tm measurements, Tournier et al. used differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF), whereas we used 
circular dichroism (CD) ). After our enzyme design campaign, we tested the thermal stability of the six 
engineered designs (Table 3) and we found that the C09 (Tm = 97.0 °C) and X05 (Tm = 96.2 °C) variants have 
a higher Tm than the reference LCC-ICCG (Tm = 92.9 °C). The X09 (Tm = 92.3 °C) variant showed a limited 
improvement in the thermal stability, while C08 (Tm = 85.6 °C) showed a slight decrease in the thermal 
stability (Figure S 2-3). For the P06 and P08 variants, we did not set out to determine the ir melting 
temperature because of their negligible enzymatic activity (see below). 
 
Table 3. Assessed melting temperature for different PETase s and improvement with respect to the  LCC wild type 
enzyme. The estimation of Tm is sensitive to the experimental setup and conditions, which could explain the difference 
between the reported Tm and the Tm determined by us. For proper comparison, we assessed the Tm of LCC-ICCG using 
the same setup that we used for the measurement of the T m of our engineered enzymes. The melting temperature 
was not assessed for P06 and P08 (n.d., not detected).

Enzymatic activity 
Terephthalic acid (TPA) is one of the major degradation product s of the activity of the enzymes on PET. 
This compound can be detected by liquid chromatography (HPLC), which allows a precise quantification 
of product formation. To assess enzymatic activity, s amples were harvested at multiple time points and 
analyzed by HPLC for the quantification of TPA production (Figure S8). Minor degradation products (MHET 
and BHET) were also assessed (Figure S9-S10). We used an enzyme concentration of 40 nM and a PET film 
of 8.4 mg in a 2 ml microplate tube to evaluate the PET degradation activity of the different mutants. The 
enzyme concentration corresponds to ≈0.3 mg ENZYME/gPET, a ratio lower than the one reported in the 
original LCC-ICCG paper (3 mgENZYME/gPET), but in agreement with the range reported in the literature (0.2 
to 3 mgENZYME/gPET).17,21,32,33 The experiments were done at 68°C, the temperature at which PET degradation 
is typically carried out in bioreactors at industrial scale to work below the glass transition temperature of

PET (Tg ≈ 70°C). If we exclude the first few hours, where ICCG performs better, at 68°C the mean TPA 
concentration at the different time points is significantly higher for the C09 mutant than for ICCG up until 
day 6 (144h, Figure 2A and S5-S8). Moreover, the specific activity of C09 is also significantly higher (≈2-
fold) than that of the gold standard LCC-ICCG over the same length of time (Figure 2B). All other enzymes 
show similar or weaker performances compared to LCC-ICCG (X09, C08, X05). At 68°C, complete sample 
degradation could be observed with C09 already at day 4  (data not shown), a feature not seen with any 
of the other enzymes, including LCC-ICCG. The % of weight loss after 6 days of reactions for all the enzymes 
is shown in Figure 2C and in S11. To assess the stability and the activity of the enzymes in harsh conditions, 
we also carried out the same experiments at 80  °C for 6 days. Also at this temperature, the mean TPA 
concentration for the C09 mutant is higher than LCC-ICCG at all the time points  (Fig. 2D, S5-S8), albeit 
being greatly reduced in absolute terms compared to the reaction at 68 °C. For the P06 and P08 variants 
we observed negligible activity (data not shown).

with the parent enzymes shows no significant changes in the folding, as observed by the minimal change 
in RMSD with respect to the WT (0. 257 Å) and to the LCC-ICCG variant (0.152 Å). The position and 
orientation of the catalytic triad (D210, H242, and S265) overlaps perfectly with the catalytic triad in the 
parent enzymes (Figure 3A). Although we observe that increased stability leads to higher enzymatic 
activity, a mechanistic explanation of the phenomenon is elusive. We hypothesize that the increase in 
stability provided by the additional surface charges in the C09 variant may help to keep the surface -
exposed catalytic site in place even at high temperatures , such as those used to test the activity  of the 
enzyme (68°C). Indeed, all the mutations introduced in the design process are found mostly on the surface 
of the enzyme and away from the catalytic triad (Figure 3B), and are thus unlikely to affect the activity 
directly. Rather, the mutations may reduce the proportion of the enzyme that may denature over time, 
and/or prevent the unfolding of the exposed catalytic triad. The denaturation (and the consequent loss of 
activity) is expected to be negligible only for T << T m. Therefore, by increasing the T m to 98°C the 
denaturation effects may be significantly reduced at the working temperature (68°C), explaining the gains 
in activity of the C09 design. The stabilization of the catalytic triad is confirmed by MD simulations, which 
show that at increasing temperatures C09  features a lower RMSF, in particular near the key catalytic 
residue H242 (Figure 3C).

introduced in the C09 variant reduce the structural fluctuations, in particular near the catalytic residue  H242 (red 
arrows).    
Conclusions 
Despite IsPETase being initially considered a promising enzyme for PET degradation, multiple studies have 
shown that thermophilic PET hydrolases (e.g., LCC), when operating at temperatures above 65°C, 
outperform mesophilic enzymes in PET biorecycling.34 Since its publication in 2020, the LCC-ICCG variant 
has been considered the state-of-the-art PETase enzyme. Hence, starting from this variant, we set out to 
engineer a novel enzyme with enhanced thermal stability and enzymatic activity. The resulting C09 design 
featured a significant improvement in term s of thermal stability (Tm=97.0°C) with respect to the gold 
standard LCC-ICCG (+4.1°C). Under optimal reaction conditions (68°C), the C09 design enzyme hydrolyzed 
low-crystallinity PET materials  into TPA  with a 2-fold higher efficiency compared to  LCC-ICCG. We 
nicknamed this design "DRK3”, in light of the introduced mutations (3 Aspartic acids, 3 Arginines, and 3 
Lysines). The DRK3 variant may represent a significant advancement towards PET biorecycling. However, 
further work will be needed to test this enzyme in industrially relevant conditions. The DRK3 variant could 
also provide the basis for further rounds of enzyme engineering. 
Recent studies reported in the literature adopted similar approaches to ours , introducing mutations to 
the LCC-ICCG enzyme to boost its performance and reporting different degrees of success .17,32,35,36 
However, as reported in relevant reviews,37,38 direct comparison of enzymatic performances is challenging 
due to the numerous variables involved in the experimental settings (PET crystallinity, PET form, PET 
concentration, enzyme concentration, temperature, salt type and concentration, pH,  etc.). In this light, 
only a direct comparison with a recognized gold standard in the same experimental conditions can provide 
reliable information. 
Although the field of PETase engineering is very dynamic and is providing  highly optimized enzymes, 
several issues still need to be thoroughly investigated to improve enzymatic PET degradation.38 One of the 
major challenges is related to the economic viability of enzymatic degradation. Another challenge, more 
directly related to protein engineering, concerns the acidification of the medium due to the release of 
TPA, which reduces the performance of the PETase enzymes known to date. Hence, possible directions 
for enzyme engineering research could be directed towards the design of acid-tolerant PETase enzymes.   
 
Material and methods 
In silico design and selection of stabilizing mutants 
We started our enzyme engineering process from the LCC-ICCG enzyme reported by Tournier et al. 15. This 
engineered enzyme is a mutant of the wild -type leaf -branch compost cutinase (LCC) carrying 4 point 
mutations: F243I, Y127G, S283C, D238C. The last two mutations are designed to induce the formation of

a second disulfide bond, in addition to the native one (C275 -C292). In both enzymes, the catalytic site is 
centered on residue S165. The structure of the LCC-ICCG engineered enzyme is available in the Protein 
Data Bank (PDB code: 6THS) as the inactivated S165A variant.  
In our design strategy we applied protocols used in previous works25–27 starting from the LCC-ICCG mutant 
structure after reverting amino acid 165 from Alanine to the catalytically active Serine. All residues within 
a distance of 5 Å from S165 were excluded from the design and were therefore left unchanged. The design 
was done using three separate methods, resulting in three different series of variants. 
The first design strategy (C-series) was performed using the Rosetta Supercharge tool .30 This tool was 
employed to reengineer the protein surface with amino acids that present a high net charge, which is 
reported to prevent aggregation of partially unfolded states. The design produced 1024 enzyme variants, 
and the best 10 based on the internal score were kept for further ranking. 
In the second design strategy (P-series) we used the PROSS web server29 to generate 9 different enzyme 
designs with improved packing, hydrogen bond networks and salt bridge networks. 
The third design strategy (X-series) employed the Disulfide-by-Design web server,31 a tool for disulphide 
bond prediction that allows to find pairs of amino acids that can carry cysteine mutations in the correct 
orientation to form disulphides. A total of 150 pair mutations were generated and, based on the internal 
scoring system, the best 10 of them were retained for further testing.   
Overall, our design campaign produced 29 different enzyme variants that were then evaluated using MD 
simulations, and then ranked according to the method described in previous works .25–27 Briefly, we 
solvated each molecular model with a 15 Å pad of TIP3P water and we introduced counter ions to 
neutralize the system charge, resulting in a final simulation box of ≈ 30.000 atoms. Hydrogen mass 
repartitioning was applied to allow a time step of 4 fs 39. The systems were subjected to 1,000 energy 
minimization steps and it equilibrated for 1 ns at a pressure of 1 atm and at a temperature of 300K with 
NAMD software,40 using AMBER19SB force field,41 non-bonded cut-off of 12 Å, rigid bonds and particle -
mesh Ewald long -range electrostatics. During the equilibration simulation, the Cα atoms of the protein 
were restrained by a 10 kcal mol−1 Å−2 spring constant. The 1 μs production runs were performed using a 
NVT ensemble whereby all the parameters (non -bonded cut -off, and PME) were the same as in the 
equilibration phase. All simulations were run in triplicates. Root Mean Square Deviations (RMSD) were 
monitored after each MD run to assess structural conver gence, while Root Mean Square Fluctuations 
(RMSF) were calculated to assess the improved stability of the design. As a result, the two best structures 
from each design series were selected, namely design C08, C09, P06, P08, X05, X09. 
 
Protein expression and purification 
The different codon -optimized nucleotide sequences  of the designed PETase mutants were cloned in a 
pET26b(+) bacterial expression vector  (Novagen), together with a C -terminal 6His-tag. All the different 
mutants were transformed and expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 Star (DE3) cells (Invitrogen).  A sample 
of 4 ml of an overnight culture of the selected strain grown in the presence of 50 µg/ml kanamycin were 
inoculated into 2L of Luria–Bertani broth (LB) at 37°C, supplemented with 50 mg/L kanamycin and grown 
until OD600 = 0.6. The expression was induced with isopropyl 1‐thio‐β‐D‐galactopyranoside (IPTG) at a final 
concentration of 0.1 mM followed by overnight incubation at 18°C and 220 rpm. Cells were collected by 
centrifugation and resuspended in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris‐HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl) supplemented with

0.2mM protease phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF) and DNAse and then lysed by sonication on ice. 
After centrifugation (45000 g for 40 min at 4°C), the soluble fraction of the cell lysate was passed through 
a 0.45-micron filter and then loaded onto a HisTrap HP 5 ml (GE Healthcare) column equilibrated with 
buffer A (20 mM Tris‐HCl pH 8.0, 300mM Nacl and 10mM imidazole). The Ni affinity column was washed 
using ten column volumes of buffer A. Before elution, five column volumes (CV) of buffer A supplemented 
with 50mM imidazole w ere used to remove unspecific proteins from the resin. T hen, the bound His‐
tagged enzyme was eluted with the same buffer supplemented with 500 mM imidazole in a linear 
gradient. The protein eluted completely with 250mM imidazole. The eluted fraction was loaded onto a 
PD-10 desalting column pre‐equilibrated with buffer C (20 mM Tris‐HCl pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl) for buffer 
exchange. Buffer exchange was performed simultaneously after the protein was purified. The desired 
protein was concentrated to ≈2 mg/ml using an Amicon 20 centrifugal filter with a molecular cutoff of 10 
KDa, and stored at −80°C. Protein concentration was assessed using a NanoDrop OneC (Thermo Fisher 
Scientific). Sample purity was evaluated by 12% SDS-PAGE. The final yields of all the enzymes were around 
16 mg/liter of bacterial culture. 
Circular dichroism 
Circular dichroism (CD) measurements were performed on a Jasco J-1500 spectropolarimeter at 20 °C. CD 
was performed to detect the secondary structure of different variants and to measure the thermostability 
of the enzyme. The spectra were determined with the following parameters: continuous scanning mode 
with scanning speed of 50 nm/min, band width 0.1 nm, data pitch 0.1 nm at 20 °C. 1.0 mm path length 
quartz cuvette was used for 5 μM samples of different enzymes in 20mM Tris‐HCl pH 8.0, 150mM NaCl. 
Thermal denaturation curves were measured in 1.0 mm path length cuvettes closed with a parafilm on 
protein solutions. Protein denaturation was induced upon increasing the temperature at a rate of 1 °C/min 
from 20 °C to 120 °C. The ellipticity at 222 nm was recorded at intervals of 0.2 °C using a 1-nm bandwidth 
and a response of 10 s. Using the Boltzmann function, the midpoints of the thermal-denaturation curves 
(Tm) were determined by fitting the data to a sigmoidal transition curve 42. Final data are the average of 
three measurements. The secondary structures of all the different variants were measured at 200-250 nm 
wavelengths and 20 °C. Ellipticity was plotted versus wavelength with GraphPad Prism 10 software. Each 
recorded spectrum was the average of three scans (See Supplementary Information Figure S2).   
Enzymatic reaction 
Bis(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (BHET), mono(hydroxyethyl)terephthalate (MHET), terephthalic acid 
(TPA), and ethylene glycol (EG) are the major depolymerization products of the activity of the enzymes on 
PET. These compounds can be separated efficiently on a C18 reversed-phase HPLC column, thus allowing 
a precise quantification of product formation. All enzyme reactions were performed at a concentration of 
40 nM at both 68 and 80 °C in quintuplicates in 2.0 mL microcentrifuge tubes in the same reaction buffer 
(20 mM Tris‐HCl pH 8.0, 300mM NaCl ). Amorphous, 250 μm -thick PET films (product number 
ES301445/11) were purchased from Goodfellow USA and cut into 6 mm diameter circular pellets using a 
hole puncher. Individual pellets, whose weight was around 8.4  mg, were then placed in 2 ml 
microcentrifuge tubes.

Reversed-phase liquid chromatography 
The different compounds produced by PET hydrolytic enzymes (TPA,  as well as BHET and MHET) were 
quantified by reverse d-phase HPLC  (See Supporting Information Table S2 -S4). HPLC analyses were 
performed on a Shimadzu LC-2030C 3D Plus system equipped with a PDA detector, a column oven and an 
autosampler (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan). Separations were carried out using a Kinetex C18 column (2.7 µm; 
4.6  150 mm, Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA). Column temperature was maintained at 40°C with a flow 
rate of 1 ml/min.  For the mobile phase, 0.1% H 3PO4 (solvent A) and MeCN (solvent B) were used. The 
linear gradient mode used for the elution was as follows: 0 min, 10% B; 0 -15 min, 10-40% B; 15-18min, 
40-65% B; 18-20 min, 65% B; 20-23 min, 65-10% B; 23-25 min 10% B. At every time interval, 100 μL of the 
sample were collected from the reaction vial placed at the set temperature. The 0h–72h samples were 
diluted 21 times (50µL of the provided sample was transferred to autosampler vial and diluted in 1 mL of 
10% MeCN + 0.1% H3PO4), whereas, 96h and 144h sampes – 101 times (10µL of the provided sample was 
transferred to autosampler vial and diluted in 1  mL of 10% MeCN + 0.1% H 3PO4). Detection was 
accomplished via measurement of UV adsorption at 220 nm; 20 μL of each sample was injected into the 
system and the degradation products were quantified against standard calibration curves ranged 0.1, 1.0, 
5.0, 10.0, 50.0 (for TPA and MHET) and 0.09, 0.9, 4.4 and 43.9 (for BHET) μg/mL. 
Protein crystallization  
Crystals of the C09 mutant were grown at room temperature using the vapor diffusion method by mixing 
a 2μL drop of a 10mg/mL protein sample with a 2μL drop of a solution containing 0.1M Sodium citrate 
tribasic dihydrate pH 5.6, 20% v/v 2 -Propanol, 20% w/v Polyethylene glycol 4,000.  Crystals, which  
appeared after one week, were frozen in liquid nitrogen using 25% (v/v) glycerol as cryoprotectant prior 
to X-ray diffraction data collection. 
 
Structure determination and refinement  
For the structure of the C09 mutant, the initial phases were obtained by molecular replacement using 
Phaser43 and the atomic coordinates of  the crystal structure of a Leaf-branch compost bacterial cutinase 
homolog (PDB entry 4EB0) as a search model. Refinement was performed by alternating rounds of 
REFMAC544 and manual adjustments in Coot .45 Water molecules were added both manually and 
automatically using the Coot_refine tool from the CCP4 package.46 The crystallographic table is shown in 
the SI file in Table S7. 
Data availability 
The final crystallographic coordinates of the crystal structures of the C09 mutant are available in the RCSB 
PDB (accession code: 8CMV).
