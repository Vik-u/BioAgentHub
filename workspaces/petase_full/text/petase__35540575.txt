The recalcitrance of plastics like nylon and other polyamides contributes to environmental problems (e.g.
microplastics in oceans) and restricts possibilities for recycling. The fact that hitherto discovered
amidases (EC 3.5.1. and 3.5.2.) only show no, or low, activity on polyamides currently obstructs
biotechnological-assisted depolymerization of man-made materials. In this work, we capitalized on
enzyme engineering to enhance the promiscuous amidase activity of polyesterases. Through enzyme
design we created a reallocated water network adapted for hydrogen bond formation to synthetic amide
backbones for enhanced transition state stabilization in the polyester-hydrolyzing biocatalystsHumicola
insolens cutinase and Thermobiﬁda cellulosilytica cutinase 1. This novel concept enabled increased
catalytic eﬃciency towards amide-containing soluble substrates. The aﬀorded enhanced hydrolysis of
the amide bond-containing insoluble substrate 3PA 6,6 by designed variants was aligned with improved
transition state stabilization identi ﬁed by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Furthermore, the
presence of a favorable water-molecule network that interacted with synthetic amides in the variants
resulted in a reduced activity on polyethylene terephthalate (PET). Our data demonstrate the potential of
using enzyme engineering to improve the amidase activity for polyesterases to act on synthetic amide-
containing polymers.
Introduction
Since their introduction in the twentieth century, polymers have
found applications extensively in packaging, in the manufacturing
of vehicles, airplanes and advanced medicinal and electronic
devices and are indispensable for our everyday life. Although the
proportion of bio-based monomers in the annual 300 Mton
production of synthetic polymers is increasing
1 (currently repre-
senting 1%), many man-made polymers are non-biodegradable.2
Discarded polymers get fragmented through abiotic mechanisms
into smaller and inert pieces (#5 mm) referred to as micro-
plastics.3 As only 1–2% of all plastics are recycled in Europe and in
the US and up to 43% of the plastic used worldwide is disposed of
in landlls,
4,5 the impact of post-consumer polymer waste on our
environment and health can be tremendous. 6,7 Innovative
approaches to valorize this source of secondary raw material and
minimize our impact on the environment are urgently needed.6,7
One approach consists of capitalizing on mild enzymatic
hydrolysis to depolymerize macromolecular architectures.8 Due
to the high specicity of enzymes, this would allow for step-wise
recovery of pure hydrolysis products even from polymer
mixtures or composite materials. Enzymatic hydrolysis of the
surface of polymers by extracellular hydrolases was reported to
be the rst step of the biotic degradation of polyesters by
microorganisms.
8 Thus, several studies have focused on the
enzymatic hydrolysis of polyesters using members of thea/b-
hydrolase superfamily, including cutinases and lipases, to
increase wettability and dye staining, and to decrease pilling
and hydrophobicity.
9–11 Recently, it was reported that the
bacterium Ideonella sakaiensisis able to degrade and assimilate
the polyester polyethylene terephthalate (PET).12
Due to resonance stabilization, chemical hydrolysis of an
amide bond proceeds three orders of magnitude slower than
that of an ester bond.
13 Moreover, even if amide and peptide
bonds share the same features, amide bonds in polyamides (PA)

are separated by extended carbon chains (Fig. S1 †), which
permit the formation of a more rigid and crystalline structure.
Nylon 6 (polycaprolactam) (Fig. S1B, le†) forms intermolecular
H-bonds which are longer and therefore weaker, while nylon
6,6(poly(hexamethylene adipamide)) (Fig. S1B, right†) contains
short H-bonds which yield a strong and dense molecular
architecture with a high melting temperature (255–265
/C14Ci n
comparison with 210–220 /C14C for nylon 6).14 Thus, mild enzy-
matic depolymerization of inert polyamide backbones is chal-
lenging. Some enzymes have been reported to hydrolyze nylon
oligomers, which are by-products of nylon production. 15–17
Eﬃcient enzymatic hydrolysis of polyamides seems to be
considerably more diﬃcult.18 Since nylon is used in fashion and
as light-weight metal-replacements it has been found to
signicantly contribute to the /C2410–20 Mtons of plastics that
end up in the oceans each year.
3,5 Therefore, nylon-degrading
biocatalysts would constitute one important class of designer
enzymes allowing recycling of wastes to valuable building
blocks. To meet this formidable challenge, enzyme engineering
and design tools are greatly needed as evolution did not yet have
had su ﬃcient time to develop enzymes e ﬃcient towards
hydrolysis of synthetic polyamides. In this work, enzyme engi-
neering aﬀorded polyesterase variants with up to 15-fold higher
activity in hydrolysis of the insoluble amide model substrate
N
1,N6-dihexyladipamide (3PA 6,6).
Cutinases are extracellular serine hydrolases produced by
bacteria and fungi to attack the plant cuticle and especially to
degrade the natural polyester cutin.
19–22 Cutinases and lipases
have been extensively analyzed in order to increase their activity
on bulky substrates.
23–25 The ability of cutinases to adsorb onto
hydrophobic surfaces has been widely used to hydrolyze
biodegradable and non-biodegradable polyesters,
26,27 such as
poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and PET, respectively, which results in
surface functionalization.28,29 Hydrolysis of bulky substrates can
be achieved aer adsorption of the enzyme on the surface of the
material.25 In cutinases, as previously reported for cutinase 1
from Thermobida cellulosilytica (TcC, formerly known as
Thc_Cut1),28 hydrophobic patches, which are present on the
surface of these enzymes, can improve the adsorption onto
polymers. The latter has been demonstrated to enhance the
activity of the enzyme, as shown for the introduction of heter-
ologous domains
30 or the truncation of enzyme domains to
improve the hydrophobicity of the protein surface.24 Moreover,
cutinases possess an exposed active site, as compared to lipases
and this feature would allow the polymer chain to be attacked
by the enzyme.
Enlarging the cavity of the active site of biocatalysts that
hydrolyze natural polyesters like cutin, for a bettertting of the
synthetic polymer chain, is a common design method to
improve enzymatic activity on bulky, insoluble hydrophobic
substrates.
31,32 Structural analysis is used to identify specic
residues, which when replaced by enzyme engineering, can lead
to improved aﬃnity and accelerated biocatalysis.
33,34 However,
introducing the missing key hydrogen bond acceptor in (poly)
esterases, required for facilitated nitrogen inversion,
35 and thus
eﬃcient (poly)amidase activity, by traditional enzyme design
constitutes a bottleneck.36 In this study, we developed a novel
approach for which a water network in the enzyme is adapted to
the synthetic substrate to enable speci c and catalytically
favorable interactions.37 With their solvent exposed active site,
we reasoned that cutinases would constitute suitable starting
templates to achieve optimized transition state (TS) stabiliza-
tion by water-restructuring mutations,
38 to unlock the chemistry
and spatial constraints dictated by protein side chains and,
thus, to aﬀord accelerated amide-bond hydrolysis.
We aimed at introducing amidase activity in two model
cutinases that were previously reported to hydrolyze PET
(Fig. 1E), namelyHumicola insolenscutinase (HiC) and TcC. To
study the activity on soluble substrates, p-nitrobutyranilide
(pNBA) and p-nitrophenyl butyrate ( pNPB) (Fig. 1A and B,
respectively), which contained either an amide or ester bond,
respectively, were used to evaluate enzyme kinetics. In order to
identify “hot-spot” positions that could be important in
dictating interactions between water and the transition state
(TS), molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed
using the model substrate 3PA 6,6 (Fig. 1C) (i.e. representing an
oligomer of nylon 6,6, Fig. 1D). Experimentally determined
activity enhancements of variants were in agreement with the
extent of transition state stabilization obtained from molecular
modeling.

6,6 and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) were purchased from
Goodfellow (UK) (thickness 50mm). Buﬀer components, bovine
serum albumin (BSA),para-nitrophenol (pNP), para-nitrophenyl
butyrate (pNPB), para-nitroaniline (pNA), and methanol were
purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (USA). The substrate for amidase
activity assay para-nitrobutyranilide ( pNBA) was purchased
from AKoS GmbH (Germany).
Sequence analysis and sequencing
DNA and protein sequences were analyzed by CLC Main
Workbench, version 7.0.3 (Qiagen, Netherlands). DNA
sequencing was performed as a customer at LGC genomics
(Germany) using Sanger sequencing.

Preparation of variants
All DNA manipulations described in this work were performed
by standard methods.41 Megaprimers for the TcC variants,
possessing the specic mutation (Table S1†) were purchased
from Microsynth AG (Switzerland) and used in two-stage PCR
reactions to introduce mutations using Pfu DNA polymerase
(Promega GmbH, Germany) and pET26b(+)_TcC as template.
Restriction enzymes were purchased from New England Biolabs
and used following the manufacturer's protocol. Plasmid DNA
was prepared using PureYield™Plasmid Miniprep and Plasmid
Midiprep system (Promega GmbH, Germany). The amplied
products were chemically transformed inEscherichia coliXL-10.
For HiC the codon-optimized genes (i.e. E. colicodon usage)
of wild-type, I167Q and L64H/I167Q variants were purchased
from GeneArt® (Life Technologies, USA). The genes were cloned
into the vector pET26b(+) and chemically transformed by heat
shock intoE. coliXL-10.
Bacterial strains, plasmid and media
Bacterial cells ofE. coli XL-10 andE. coli BL21-Gold(DE3) (Agi-
lent Technologies, USA) strains were used for subcloning and
expression, respectively. The vector pET26b(+) (Novagen, Ger-
many) was used for expression of HiC and TcC wild-type and
variants. Luria-Bertani (LB) medium, supplemented by 40mg
mL
/C01 kanamycin as a selective agent, was used to culture the
plasmid-carrying cells. In order to determine the cell density at
OD
600 Hach DR3900 Spectrophotometer (USA) was used.
Enzyme expression and purication
HiC wild-type and variants.The fermentation ofE. colicells
carrying the vector containing the genes for HiC wild-type and
variants was constituted by two phases, the overnight batch
phase limited by nutrient availability and the fed-batch phase
during the induction of the recombinant protein expression.
Cultivations were done in 5 L bioreactors (Minifors, Switzer-
land). The pH was controlled at pH 7.0/C60.2 by addition of 25%
NH
4OH, oxygen saturation was maintained at pO2 > 30%, the
temperature was set at 37.0/C14C /C60.5 /C14C and 5% w/w Glanapon
2000 (Bussetti, Austria) was used as antifoam solution. For the
batch phase, 1.75 L batch medium
42 were sterileltered into the
bioreactor and supplemented with 40mgm L/C01 kanamycin. The
trace element solution was prepared in 5 N HCl and included
40 g L/C01 FeSO4$7H2O, 10 g L/C01 MnSO4$H2O, 10 g L/C01 AlCl3-
$6H2O, 4 g L/C01 CoCl2,2gL /C01 ZnSO4$7H2O, 2 g L/C01 Na2MoO2-
$2H2O, 1 g L/C01 CuCl2$2H2O, and 0.5 g L/C01 H3BO3. The batch was
inoculated with the desiredE. colistrains, carrying the vector for
HiC wild-type or variants, directly from the 1.5 mL cryo-stock
and grown overnight. Aer complete consumption of nutrient
dening the end of the batch phase, an exponential fed-batch
cultivation, which maintained a constant specic growth rate
of 0.1 h
/C01, was initiated. The substrate feed (3 g L/C01 KH2PO4,4g
L/C01 K2HPO4, 113 g L/C01 glucose monohydrate, 10 g L/C01 Na3C6-
H5O7$2H2O, 4 g L/C01 MgSO4$7H2O, 0.8 g L/C01 CaCl2$2H2O, 2 mL
L/C01 and trace elements) was program-controlled with feedback
control of feed ask weight loss and last for 3 generations
(approximately 23 h). Recombinant protein expression was
induced by addition of isopropyl-b-
D-1-thiogalactoside (IPTG) to
the reactor at the beginning of the fed-batch phase with 0.9
mmol IPTG per g calculated cell-dry matter (5.6 g CDM). Anal
volume of 3.2 L was reached. Aliquots were taken frequently and
stored at/C020
/C14C until further analysis.
TcC wild-type and variants. Single colonies freshly trans-
formed were picked from agar plates containing 40mgm L/C01
kanamycin and inoculated in 20 mL LB-medium supplemented
with 40mgm L/C01 kanamycin and incubated overnight at 37/C14C
and 150 rpm. This culture was diluted in 200 mL LB-medium
containing 40 mgm L/C01 kanamycin to an OD600 of 0.1 and
incubated at 37/C14C and 150 rpm to reach an OD600 of 0.6–0.8.
The culture was induced with 0.05 mM isopropyl-b-D-1-thio-
galactoside (IPTG) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) for 20 h at 20/C14C. The
inactive variant TcC_Ser131Ala was expressed and puried as
previously described.43
Purication of His-tagged enzymes.Cell lysis and purica-
tion by nickel-immobilized metal ion aﬃnity chromatography
(Ni-IMAC) were carried out as previously described by Herrero
et al.
26 Buﬀer was exchanged to 0.1 M Tris–HCl pH 7 by PD-10
desalting columns (GE Healthcare, USA) and the solution was
concentrated by Vivaspin 20, 10 000 Da MWCO (Sartorius AG,
Germany).
Protein analysis
Bradford assay
44 using Bio-Rad Protein Assay kit was carried out
to measure the protein concentration using bovine serum
albumin (BSA) (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) as standard. Sodium
dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE)
was performed according to Laemmli using precast gels
purchased from Bio-Rad (USA), run at 200 V for 30 min. Pre-
stained protein marker IV (Peqlab, Germany) was used as
a molecular mass marker. Coomassie method was used to stain
the protein bands.
Enzyme activity assay
Esterase activity.Esterase activity was measured usingpNPB
as substrate, as previously described

A blank reaction was carried out containing buﬀer instead of
enzyme solution. The molar extinction coeﬃcient (3405) forpNP
was calculated as 0.1 M potassium phosphate buﬀer pH 7 as
8.31 M/C01 cm/C01. One unit of enzyme activity (U) was dened as
the amount of enzyme releasing 1mmol of pNP per minute
under the given experimental conditions. Specic activity was
expressed as U mg/C01 of protein. Substrate specicity (kcat/KM)
was calculated in a substrate range of 0.3 to 6.3 mMpNPB.
Kinetic data were calculated by simple weighted non-linear
regression of the Michaelis–Menten equation using the Sig-
maPlot soware, version 12.5 (Systat Soware Inc).
Amidase activity. Amidase activity was measured using
pNBA. The substrate was rst dissolved in 100% DMSO, to
a nal concentration of 100 mM. Aerwards this solution was
diluted in 0.1 M potassium phosphate buﬀer pH 7 to anal
concentration of 2.25 mM. The amidase activity was measured
at 405 nm and 25
/C14C for 4 hours using a substrate range of 0.01
to 2.04 mMpNBA and compared to the wild-type enzyme. The
molar extinction coeﬃcient (3405) for para-nitroaniline (pNA)
was calculated as 15.9 M/C01 cm/C01. One unit of enzyme activity
(U) was dened as the amount of enzyme releasing 1mmol of
pNA per minute under the given experimental conditions.
Specic activity, substrate specicity and kinetic data were
carried out as reported above.
Hydrolysis of polyethylene terephthalate (PET)
In order to determine the activity towards bulky polyesters, 5mM
HiC and TcC wild-type and variants were incubated with 0.5/C2
1 cm amorphous PETlms (50 mm thickness) in 0.1 M potas-
sium phosphate buﬀer pH 7 for 72 h at 50/C14C and 100 rpm. In
order to remove impurities, PETlms were previously washed
with three diﬀerent washing steps at 50/C14C and 100 rpm, each
step for 30 min,rstly with 5 g L/C01 Triton X-100, then with 0.1 M
sodium carbonate andnally with MQ water. Aer incubation
the supernatant was treated to precipitate the enzyme by
pouring ice-cold methanol in a ratio of 1 : 1. The sample was
then acidied with 6 M HCl to a pH 4 and then centrifuged at
14 000/C2g at 0
/C14C for 15 min. Finally the supernatant wasltered
through a 0.22 mm lter and analyzed by high performance
liquid chromatography (HPLC) in a Hewlett Packard series 1050
system, coupled with an Agilent Poroshell 120 Ec-C18, 30/C250
mm, 2.7mm column with a precolumn Poroshell 120 Ec-C18, 3.0
/C25.0 mm, 2.7mm, UHPLC guard column (Agilent Technologies,
USA) heated at 40
/C14C with auorescence detector. The samples
were eluted using a non-linear gradient with a constantow rate
of 0.75 mL min/C01. Concentration of formic acid (A) was always
kept at 0.01%. The gradient started with 10% methanol (B) and
80% water (C) at 1 min, 50% B and 40% C at 8 min, 90% B and
0% C at 11 min. The injection volume of the sample was 10mL.
The release products were detected via UV spectroscopy at
241 nm.

Hydrolysis of model substrate 3 PA 6,6
To investigate the activity of the enzymes and their variants
towards amide bonds, 10 mg 3PA 6,6 model substrate was
incubated in the presence of 5mM enzyme in 0.1 M potassium
phosphate buﬀer pH 7 at 50
/C14C and 100 rpm. Aer hydrolysis
the samples were frozen and lyophilized for 48 h, until complete
removal of water. The powder was resuspended in 100%
methanol. Aer centrifugation at 14 000 rpm the solution was
ltered through a 0.2mm PSTFlter and placed in a glass vial.
Calibration standards of 3PA 6,6 in methanol for gas
chromatography-ame-ionization detection (GC-FID) were
prepared in a range of 1 to 250 mg L
/C01. The GC-FID analyses
were performed using a Hewlett-Packard (Palo Alto, CA). A J&W
Scientic (Folson, CA) DB-17MS capillary column (30 m/C2250
mm /C20.25 mm) was used with nitrogen as the carrier gas. A
splitless injection mode (1mL) was used with the following GC
temperatures: injection port, 300/C14C; initial column tempera-
ture, 40/C14C; initial hold time, 0.5 min;rst temperature ramp,
20 /C14C min/C01; second column temperature, 70/C14C; second hold
time, 1 min; second temperature ramp, 30 /C14C min/C01; nal
column temperature, 340/C14C; nal hold time, 2 min. The total
GC-FID run time was 14 min.
Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS)
In order to determine possible release of building blocks from
the bulky substrate nylon 6,6, aer incubation of the enzyme
with the polymer, the supernatant of the reactions was lyophi-
lized using a Christ Freeze dryer Beta 1-16, 220 V, 50 Hz, 1.2 kW.
The lyophilized samples were resuspended in ethyl acetate
(Sigma-Aldrich, USA) andltered through a 0.2mm PSTFlter
and placed in a glass vial. The GC-MS analyses of the superna-
tant were performed using an Agilent 7890A (Santa Clara, CA)
equipped with a mass selective detector 5975C VL MSD with
triple axis. The system was equipped with a PAL-xt autosampler
(CTC Analytics AG, Switzerland). A J&W Scientic (Folson, CA)
DB-17MS capillary column (30 m/C2250 mm /C20.25 mm) was
used with nitrogen as the carrier gas. A deactivated glass wool
tapered bleed temperature optimized (BTO) was used as an inlet
liner and a splitless injection mode (1mL) was used with the
following GC temperatures: injection port, 300
/C14C; initial
column temperature, 50 /C14C; initial hold time, 2 min; rst
temperature ramp, 7 /C14C min/C01; second column temperature
100 /C14C; second hold time, 1 min; second temperature ramp,
6 /C14C min/C01; third column temperature 220/C14C; third hold time,
2 min; third temperature ramp, 20 /C14C min/C01; nal column
temperature, 340 /C14C; nal hold time, 5 min; total run time,
43 min. The MSD source was kept at 230/C14C, the quadrupole at
190 /C14C, the transfer line at 300/C14C with a scan range between 25
and 500 AMU with a gain factor of 5. The solvent was delayed for
2.8 min.
Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations
Molecular dynamics simulations on Humicola insolens cuti-
nase was based on the PDB le 4OYY
48 using YASARA 49
version 14.5.21. For Thermobi da cellulosilytica cutinase 1,
the PDB le 5LUI was used.50 For both enzyme structures,
missing hydrogens were added and the corresponding
hydrogen network was optimized by using Amber03 force
eld and keeping all heavy atoms xed. Crystallographic
waters were kept. For the van der Waals interactions, a cut-oﬀ

of 7.86 /C23A was used and PME accounted for long-range elec-
trostatics. 51 The structures were minimized through repeated
steps of short molecular dynamics and energy minimiza-
tions, initially by releasing xed waters and then on all
atoms. The obtained structures were nally subjected to
simulated annealing. The second tetrahedral intermediate
formed during acylation of the catalytic serine (S131 for TcC
and S103 for HiC, respectively) represented the TS for
nitrogen inversion.
35 The tetrahedral intermediate was con-
structed by covalent attachment of the 3PA 6,6 substrate. For
HiC, the construction of the tetrahedral intermediate was
guided by a previously generated homology model.
36 Force
eld parameterization for the tetrahedral intermediate was
obtained by the AUTOSMILES methodology as implemented
in YASARA.
52 All simulations were performed in a water box
that contained approximately 4000 (for HiC) and 5000 (for
TcC) explicit water molecules. The pH was set to 7.4 and
corresponding protonation states of enzymes side chains was
predicted by the built-in empirical method
53 in YASARA. The
introduced His in the HiC L64H/I167Q variant was kept
unprotonated throughout the MD simulation (predicted pK
a
7.2). The simulation cell was neutralized through the addi-
tion of 0.9% NaCl. All simulations were performed under
standard conditions under the canonical ensemble at 298 K
using a Berendsen thermostat (and the Amber03 forceeld).
MD-simulations were performed for 120 ns (with 20 ns
equilibration phase and 100 ns production phase) and in
duplicate. For the duplicates, diﬀerent initial random seeds
were obtained by a slight change in the simulation temper-
ature (by 0.0012 K). All possible water networks in proximity
of the reacting amide group of the substrate were analyzed. A
weak hydrogen bond was dened as an interaction between
donor and acceptor with a hydrogen bond distance of#3 /C23A,
and angle $120
/C14.
Results and discussion
Enzyme design and molecular dynamics analysis of variants
on insoluble substrate
We hypothesized that de-shielding the protein backbone to
aﬀord enhanced polarity and reduced steric hindrance at
identi ed sites would be benecial in providing enhanced
access of“spectator ”water molecules to the TS, as previously
discussed in the context of protein unfolding.18 From a basal
energy minimization of the second tetrahedral intermediate
representing the TS for nitrogen inversion, 35 potential hot-
spot residues were identi e d .F o rT c C( F i g .2 A ) ,t h es i d e

interaction between water and the TS representing hydro-
lysis of 3PA 6,6. We reasoned that mutating these identied
hydrophobic sites to small, polar residues would enable
water to access the TS and to engage in hydrogen bonding to
the reacting NH-group of the amide substrate. In order to
test the diﬀerent hot-spots, in the case of HiC, two diﬀerent
variants were constructed, HiC_I167Q and
HiC_L64H_I167Q. In the case of TcC, three single variants
were constructed, TcC_I179A, TcC_I179N, and TcC_I179Q.
100 ns MD-simulations run in duplicate suggested that
variants of TcC (Fig. 2C, le) were capable of weak hydrogen
bond formation accepted by water in the modeled TS, which
was associated with higher experimentally determined
activity of 3PA 6,6 hydrolysis. In contrast, HiC variants
(Fig. 2C, right) did not display signi cantly higher abun-
dances of productive water clusters.
Expression and biochemical characterization of variants
The expression of the corresponding codon-optimized genes in
Escherichia coliBL21-Gold(DE3) wasrst assayed in shakeasks
revealing that TcC wild type and variants were expressed in high
amounts (Fig. 3A). In contrast, HiC wild type and designed
variants did not show overexpression notwithstanding codon
optimization and thus expression by fed-batch bioreactors was
required, to reach suﬃcient amounts of enzyme to be used for
downstream processing (Fig. 3A). Initial experimental analysis
of puried variants on the selected small substrates (pNPB and
pNBA) revealed a general trend: variants targeted for redesigned
water networks (Fig. 2), displayed enhanced speci city for
amides and decreased specicity for esters (Fig. 3B, Fig. S2†).
The most prominent eﬀect was observed for HiC L64H/I167Q
that showed increased catalytic eﬃciency towards pNBA (5-
fold increase ink
cat/KM) and a signicant decrease in esterase
activity (13-fold) as compared to that of wild-type HiC, which
together resulted in a 66-fold change in relative reaction spec-
icity in favor of amide bond hydrolysis. For TcC, only the
variant I179Q displayed a higher catalytic eﬃciency for amide
bond hydrolysis (10-fold) as compared to that of wild-type
(Fig. 3B), whereas all three variants showed a 5 to 10 fold in
loss of their esterase activity. Among the three variants, TcC
I179Q showed the highest change in relative reaction specicity
(Fig. 3B).
Enhanced amidase activity towards oligomers
In order to test the ability of the HiC and TcC variants to act
on amide-containing insoluble substrates, the hydrolysis of
the small substrate 3PA 6,6 (Fig. 1C and S3†) was analyzed
both experimentally and computationally (Fig. 2C and Table
1). Remarkably, all designed TcC variants showed higher
activity with 3PA 6,6 hydrolysis rates being accelerated 6- to
15- fold (Table 1). Indeed, it was found that the relative
abundance of weak hydrogen bonds to the reacting amide
group in the modeled TS correlated with the experimentally
determined hydrolytic activity , especially in the case of TcC

important role for chemistry in contributing to the rate-
limiting step. For HiC, engineered variants did not show
signicantly altered propensities of hydrogen bond forma-
tion compared to wild type (up to 3-fold change), in contrast
to TcC for which the probability increased one order of
magnitude (up to 14-fold). This observation is aligned with
the lower activities displayed by HiC variants. It is possible
that our strategy to capitalize on a homology model

MD analysis con rmed that the preferred hydrogen bond
acceptor in the modeled TS of the variants was a water
molecule network (Fig. S4 and Tables S2–S4†), in line with
our hypothesis that water-restructuring mutations (Fig. 2)
dictate interactions between water and the TS for oligomer
hydrolysis. In fact, for TcC a water network was the only
possibility for the I179A variant (Table 1, Fig. S4†). Moreover,
the introduced mutations were found to impact the density of
water around the TS for 3PA 6,6 hydrolysis (Table S4 †).
Analysis of root mean square deviation (RMSD) throughout
the 100 ns simulation did not reveal conformational changes

were 0.7 /C23A for HiC wild type and I167Q variant and 1.0/C23Af o r
the double mutant respectivel y. This could point towards
a more plastic structure for HiC and we cannot rule out
dynamical eﬀects contributing to catalysis.
Experimental tests of the activity of the designer enzymes on
nylon 6,6 showed that this polymer was not able to be hydrolyzed
in a high yield and only small amounts of release products were
detected by GC/MS (Fig. S6–S7†). This was probably due to the
strong hydrogen bonding present in the structure of nylon 6,6.
Loss of polyesterase activity
Although, cutinases have been widely reported to be able to
hydrolyze the polyester PET (Fig. S8†), the two cutinases used
in this work, HiC and TcC, showed di ﬀerent hydrolysis

activity on PET. On the one hand, HiC wild type showed a 25
fold higher activity on PET than that of TcC, which corre-
sponds to the release of almost 200 moles of products
per mol of biocatalyst (Fig. 4A and B), similarly to what was
shown towards the soluble substrate pNPB (Fig. 3B).
Remarkably, the variant HiC L64H/I167Q showed a complete
loss of activity on PET, while HiC I167Q showed a striking
decrease in activity of almost 94%. Instead, TcC variants did
not show a complete loss of polyesterase activity. The estab-
lishment of a water network for stabilization of the nitrogen
inversion needed for the hydrolysis of the amide bond was
able to reduce their ability to hydrolyze ester bond. A possible
explanation is electrostatic repulsion between water and the
oxygen atoms of the ester-containing substrate as previously
discussed.

Conclusions
In this study, we have successfully demonstrated that the
constitution of a water network to facilitate the nitrogen
inversion mechanism by H-bonding, which is present in
amidases and proteases, can increase promiscuity of poly-
esterases to act on amide-containing substrates. Cutinases,
and especially HiC and TcC, have been widely used for the
hydrolysis of polyesters due to their ability to hydrolyze the
natural hydrophobic polymer cutin, thanks to their active site
present on the surface of the enzyme. The substitution of
selected hydrophobic amino acids to polar residues enabled
water to access the transition state and stabilize it by hydrogen

diﬀerent substrates which contain either amide- or ester-
bonds and the ability of the variants to accept both soluble
and insoluble substrates was conrmed. We identied several
variants of TcC that showed signicantly accelerated rates of
hydrolysis of insoluble amides represented by 3PA 6,6. Both
HiC variants showed improved amidase activity on the small
substrate pNBA, which reached, in the case of L64H/I167Q,
almost 66-fold increased relative reaction speci city
compared to the HiC wild-type. Interestingly, the latter variant,
L64H/I167Q, showed a complete lossof its polyesterase activity
on the bulky substrate PET. However, all the other tested
variants retained a partial activity on the recalcitrant polymer,
probably due to the lacking combination of the two substitu-
tions. To the best of our knowledge, no microorganism has
been identied so far, which is able to degrade the industrial
bulky polymer nylon 6,6. Herein, we have shown that a recon-
gured water network adapted to the synthetic polymer
backbone and obtained by enzyme design can turn polyester-
degrading enzymes into amidases by providing eﬃcient tran-
sition state stabilization. Further improvements of the vari-
ants which carry the amidase activity may increase their
activity and could pave the way towards the formation of
a “nylonidase” and the recovery of valuable polyamide
building blocks from complex plastic mixtures, composites
and blends
55 through selective depolymerization of the poly-
amide constituents.
