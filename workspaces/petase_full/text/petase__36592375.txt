A New PETase from the Human Saliva Metagenome and Its
Functional Modification via Genetic Code Expansion in Bacteria
Mirren F. M. White and Stephen Wallace*
Abstract: The discovery and engineering of new plastic
degrading enzymes is an important challenge in chemical
biotechnology to enable transition to a more sustainable
and circular plastics economy. This field has so far
yielded a range of enzymes and microbial pathways for
the recycling and valorization of plastic waste. New
research from Uttamapinant et al. reports the discovery
of a novel polyethylene terephthalate (PET) hydrolase
from the human saliva metagenome that displays
improved properties and catalytic performance over
previously characterized PET hydrolases (PETases).
The authors also demonstrate the site-specific incorpo-
ration of a photocaged unnatural amino acid, 2,3-
diaminopropionic acid (DAP), which upon photodecag-
ing enables covalent binding of DAP to the PET surface.
Thus, this work highlights metagenomic datasets as an
untapped source of new PET degrading enzymes and
the chemical modification of PETases via genetic code
expansion, enabling new biotechnologies for the circular
plastics economy.
P lastic is a ubiquitous material across modern-day society.
However, the mismanagement of plastic waste has led to the
accumulation of this synthetic material in ecosystems world-
wide, resulting in reduced biodiversity and widespread
plastic pollution. Polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is the
major constituent of single-use plastics and accounts for the
majority of global plastic waste. In 2016, scientists sampling
the environment surrounding a PET recycling facility in
Japan isolated a novel bacterium, Ideonella sakaiensis, that
had evolved the metabolic chemistry to both breakdown and
assimilate PET as a sole carbon and energy source.
[1]
This
led to the discovery of a novel enzyme, IsPETase, that could
catalyze the hydrolysis of PET into its constituent mono-
mers, ethylene glycol and terephthalic acid (TPA). As a
result, this sparked a series of protein engineering and
directed evolution endeavors to increase the activity of
IsPETase and other PET hydrolases (PETase) for industrial
use.
[2–8]
In parallel, this early work also led to increased
efforts to identify new plastic-degrading enzymes from
metagenomic datasets isolated from diverse plastic-contami-
nated environments.
[9–11]
In this recent report by Uttamapi-
nant et al.,
[12]
the authors identified new PETase enzymes
from marine and human saliva metagenomes. The catalytic
activities of these enzymes are higher than many native and
engineered PETase enzymes reported to date, and therefore
represent attractive targets for future protein engineering,
directed evolution and industrial biotechnology. This study
also demonstrates the incorporation of a photocaged 2,3-
diaminopropionic acid (DAP)-containing unnatural amino
acid into the active site of PETase MG8 via AMBER codon
suppression, transforming the enzyme upon UV irradiation
into a covalent PET binder.
The authors began by searching the open-access MGnify
metagenomic database for non-redundant protein homologs
containing the Ser/Asp/His catalytic triad of IsPETase. This
generated 629 amino acid sequences from close to 200 000
samples isolated from human or aquatic environments.
Candidate sequences were narrowed based on clustering to
known highly active PETases within a sequence similarity
network. Shortlisted sequences were manually curated based
on the nature of the isolation environment—e.g. selecting
for high salinity and marine environments located near
PET-containing “garbage patches” (Figure 1a). This gener-
ated 10 candidate sequences that were distinct from known
PETases for further investigation—MG1-MG7 and MG8-
MG10, from marine and human metagenomes, respectively.
Using BLAST tool, all candidates were putatively assigned
to be of bacterial origin—MG1-MG8 from Gram-negative
Pseudomonadota, and MG9-MG10 from Gram-positive
Actinomycetota. All candidates were expressed in Escher-
ichia coli, isolated, and refolded in vitro from insoluble
inclusion bodies for characterization of their PET degrading
activity. Intriguingly, all except MG4 also contained putative
secretion signal tags, indicating their potential role in the
degradation of extracellular ester substrates in native
environments. All of the candidate enzymes displayed NaCl-
dependent activity (up to 5 M NaCl), and MG1, MG7, MG8
and MG10 displayed the highest activity toward the PET-
derived substrate bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate
(BHET). Following a subsequent assay using PET powder,
the authors narrowed their focus to MG8, a hydrolase
enzyme isolated from a human saliva metagenome sample.
Overall, MG8 displayed the highest activity across multiple
tests, and at 55 ° C the enzyme produced ca. 5–83 fold

increased TPA from PET when compared to IsPETase,
DuraPETase and ThermoPETase (Figure 1b). The authors
also identified an unusual structural feature in MG8 to
which they attribute this increased activity—a three-residue
extension of the catalytic loop within the enzyme active site
containing a phenylalanine at position 250 that supposedly
has evolved to increase binding to the hydrophobic PET
surface. MG8 is the first example of a PETase isolated from
the human saliva metagenome, displaying improved catalytic
properties and intriguing additional structural motifs that
make it a notable addition to the growing family of plastic-
degrading enzymes. Improving the activity and productivity
of MG8 towards industrial and post-consumer PET samples
will be essential for the application of MG8 at scale for PET
recycling. Additionally, the high cost of enzymes containing
unnatural amino acids should be addressed as this is
currently prohibitive at scale.
Following characterization of the novel PETases, the
authors focused on the modification of MG8 as a tool for
the functional display of proteins on the surface of PET.
This approach offers a novel method to co-localize enzymes
to plastic surfaces for enhanced biodegradation/upcycling, or
as a platform for the development of wearable biosensors
using waste PET. The authors hypothesized that by incorpo-
rating the non-canonical amino acid DAP in place of the
catalytic serine residue in the enzyme active site, the acyl-
enzyme intermediate that is formed during the breakdown
of PET would be instead stabilized covalently, resulting in
binding of the enzyme to the plastic surface. This elegant
approach also addresses a critical challenge in the field of
PETase-directed evolution: overcoming the native catalytic
properties of residues surrounding the oxyanion hole to
catalyze both formation and hydrolysis of the acyl-enzyme is
extremely difficult. Here, site-specific modification of S171
with a photocaged DAP (pDAP) via genetic code expansion
would generate MG8
S171DAP
upon photodecaging under basic
conditions, which would in turn form a stable amide
intermediate with PET during the catalytic cycle. To this
end, co-expression of MG8

translation machinery pDAPRS/PyltRNA

by UV light (365 nm) and incubation in the
presence of DTT at pH 8.5. The authors then proposed
using protein fusions with DAP-modified MG8 to display a
variety of functional handles for bioconjugation. They
demonstrate this using a split-GFP system to enable the
stable attachment and visualization of GFP on the surface of
PET and other bio-based and biodegradable plastics,
including polybutylene succinate, polycaprolactone and
polylactic acid (Figure 1c).
The enzyme-catalyzed degradation and recycling of PET
waste is a critical pillar for the future sustainable manufac-
turing of plastic materials, in addition to the use of plastic as
a feedstock for the circular bioeconomy via microbial
upcycling.

This study by Uttamapinant et al. demonstrates
the exploration of open-access metagenomic datasets to
uncover new PET-degrading enzymes and reports the
discovery of one of the most active PETases in the literature
to date. MG8 is also the first PETase to be isolated from a
human saliva metagenome, indicating that the extensive use
of plastic materials and microplastics in food has triggered
the evolution of PETases in the human oral cavity. Using
genetic code expansion, the authors demonstrate the trans-
formation of MG8 PETase into a PET-binding enzyme
through site-specific modification of the active site with a
reactive unnatural amino acid, paving the way for the
functional modification of PET and the study of enzyme
binding to diverse plastic surfaces. Together, this work
demonstrates the remarkable metabolic plasticity of micro-
organisms to utilize diverse “waste” carbon feedstocks, and
how the bioinformatic exploration of metagenomic datasets
collected from diverse microbial environments can be
combined with modern synthetic biology tools to generate
new biotechnologies for the circular chemical economy.
