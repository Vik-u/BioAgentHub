A growing accumulation of plastic wastes has become a severe environmental
and social issue. It is urgent to develop innovative approaches for the disposal
of plastic wastes. In recent years, reports on biodegradation of synthetic plastics
by microorganisms or enzymes have sprung up, and these offer a possibility to
develop biological treatment technology for plastic wastes. In this review, we have
comprehensively summarized the microorganisms and enzymes that are able to
degrade a variety of generally used synthetic plastics, such as polyethylene (PE),
polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl chloride (PVC), polyurethane (PUR),
and polyethylene terephthalate (PET). In addition, we have highlighted the microbial
metabolic pathways for plastic depolymerization products and the current attempts
toward utilization of such products as feedstocks for microbial production of chemicals
with high value. Taken together, these ﬁndings will contribute to building a conception
of bio-upcycling plastic wastes by connecting the biodegradation of plastic wastes
to the biosynthesis of valuable chemicals in microorganisms. Last, but not least,
we have discussed the challenges toward microbial degradation and valorization of
plastic wastes.

INTRODUCTION
Synthetic plastics, including polyethylene (PE), polystyrene (PS), polypropylene (PP), polyvinyl
chloride (PVC), polyurethane (PUR), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) (Table 1), have become
fundamental to almost every aspect of our lives. According to the latest statistics of Plastics-Europe,
the global yield of plastics reached 348 million tons in 2018 (Plastics Europe, 2018). China and the
European Union account for 29.4 and 18.5%, ranking ﬁrst and second in the world, of all the world’s
plastic use, respectively (China Plastics Industry, 2017; Plastics Europe, 2018). Concomitant with
the growing consumption of plastics, the generation of plastic wastes increases rapidly around the
world. It is predicted that up to 26 billion tons of plastic wastes will be produced by 2050, and more
than half will be thrown away into landﬁlls and ﬁnally enter ecospheres, such as oceans and lakes,
leading to serious environmental pollution (Jambeck et al., 2015; Lönnstedt and Eklöv, 2016; Geyer
et al., 2017). As a result, plastic wastes have become a malevolent symbol of our wasteful society.
The current methods for disposing of plastic wastes mainly include landﬁlling, incineration, and
mechanical and chemical recycling (Peng et al., 2018). In most countries, especially the developing
countries, landﬁlling is the major method for plastic wastes disposal due to its operability and low

cost. However, the accumulated plastic wastes have occupied a
great amount of land. Incineration of plastic wastes can reduce
the demand of landﬁlls and recover heat energy, but we also
need to reduce the environmental eﬀects of secondary pollutants
generated from the incinerating process, such as dioxins, carbon
monoxide, nitrogen oxides, and so on. Although mechanical
recycling has become the primary recycling method and is
applied for reusing thermoplastic wastes, the properties of most
recycled materials are signiﬁcantly compromised after a number
of processing cycles, and the resulting commercial values are
thus limited. As an alternative, chemical recycling can recover
the monomers and other chemicals from plastic wastes, but its
success relies on the aﬀordability of processes and the eﬃciency
of catalysts (Rahimi and García, 2017). Nowadays, it is reported
that only 9 and 12% of global plastic wastes is recycled and
incinerated, while up to 79% is discarded into landﬁlls or the
natural environment, indicating that there is a great need for
exploring innovative recycling methods to dispose of plastic
wastes (Garcia and Robertson, 2017; Geyer et al., 2017).
In recent years, a number of studies have reported that
several microorganisms and enzymes are capable of degrading
synthetic plastics. Although numerous reviews and viewpoints
on the topic of biodegradation of plastic have been published,
they have mainly focused on the biodegradation of a single kind
of plastic, such as PE (Restrepo-Flórez et al., 2014), PS (Ho
et al., 2018), PP (Arutchelvi et al., 2008), PUR (Cregut et al.,
2013; Peng et al., 2018; Magnin et al., 2019c), and PET (Wei
and Zimmermann, 2017a; Kawai et al., 2019; Taniguchi et al.,
2019). A comprehensive review into biodegradation of all main
kinds of plastic is necessary (Wei and Zimmermann, 2017b).
Moreover, a review focusing on not only the biodegradation
but also the biological upcycling of plastic wastes is even more
attractive (Wierckx et al., 2015; Salvador et al., 2019; Blank et al.,
2020). In this review, we have summarized the microorganisms
and enzymes that have been proven to be capable of degrading
plastics, such as PE, PS, PP , PVC, PUR, and PET, as well as the
microbial metabolic pathways of the plastic depolymerization
products and the current attempts toward utilization of these
products as feedstocks for microbial valorization. Based on
the above understandings, we have attempted to develop a
biologically upcycling conception for plastic wastes through
building a metabolic link between biodegradation of plastic
wastes and biosynthesis of valuable chemicals in microorganisms
(Figure 1). Finally, we have discussed the existing knowledge gaps
and challenges facing microbial degradation and valorization
of plastic wastes.

Ru et al. Microbial Degradation and Valorization of Plastic Wastes
FIGURE 1 |The basic conception of bio-upcycling plastic wastes. A mixture of a variety of plastic wastes will be ﬁrstly mechanically grinded and biologically
depolymerized by plastic-degrading microorganisms and enzymes. Then, the depolymerization products will be separated from the culture and utilized as
feedstocks for microbial fermentation to produce chemicals with high value, such as polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA), succinic acid, and biosurfactant.
MICROBIAL DEGRADATION OF
SYNTHETIC PLASTICS
A number of microorganisms capable of degrading polyoleﬁns
(PE, PS, and PP), PVC, PUR, and PET have been isolated from
the open environment, such as the soil of a plastic-dumping
site, waste of mulch ﬁlms, marine water, soil contaminated
by crude oil, sewage sludge, landﬁlls, and the guts of plastic-
eating worms ( Tables 2–7). The screening of plastic-degrading
microorganisms is crucial for identifying the depolymerases and
other key enzymes involved in plastic degradation.
PE
As early as the 1970s, Albertsson carried out an experiment
on microbial degradation of 14C-labeled PE (average weight
molecular weight of 300,000 Da) by using three diﬀerent soil
microbiotas as inocula (Albertsson, 1978). In terms of the release
of 14CO2, the microbial degradation rate of PE was calculated to
be in the range of 0.36ñ0.39% after 2 years (Albertsson, 1978).
When the 14C-labeled PE was extracted with cyclohexane to
get rid of its low molecular weight components (average weight
molecular weight of 1,000 Da), the microbial degradation rate
dropped to 0.16% (Albertsson, 1980). Therefore, it was concluded
that the release of 14CO2 was mainly derived from the microbial
degradation of the low molecular weight PE fraction, which was
similar to the microbial degradation of straight-chain n-alkanes
(Albertsson, 1980). After that, Kawai et al. claimed that the upper
limit of molecular weight for PE degradation by microorganisms
was about 2,000 Da based on the results of a numerical simulation
(Kawai et al., 1999, 2002, 2004; Watanabe et al., 2003, 2004).
Although the high molecular weight was considered as
a key factor impeding the microbial degradation of PE,
the physicochemical pretreatments, including UV irradiation
(Albertsson et al., 1987; Albertsson and Karlsson, 1988, 1990),
chemical oxidizing agents (Brown et al., 1974), and thermo-
oxidation (Lee et al., 1991), could facilitate the microbial
degradation of long-chain PE since these pretreatments led to
the depolymerization of long-chain PE as well as the formation
of low molecular weight products (Albertsson et al., 1995,
1998; Erlandsson et al., 1998; Hakkarainen and Albertsson,
2004). Consequently, it was assumed that the environmental
degradation of long-chain PE could be achieved by the synergistic
actions of photo- or thermo-oxidation and the biological activity
of microorganisms (Hakkarainen and Albertsson, 2004).

Nevertheless, it was intriguing to ﬁgure out whether the long-
chain PE (molecular weight > 2,000 Da) could be degraded by
microorganisms from nature. A number of strains capable of
degrading un-pretreated PE have been isolated from a variety
of environments, including mulch ﬁlms, marine water, soil
contaminated by crude oil, sewage sludge, and landﬁlls ( Table 2;
Orr et al., 2004; Sivan et al., 2006; Sudhakar et al., 2008;
Balasubramanian et al., 2010; Yoon et al., 2012; Tribedi and
Sil, 2013; Harshvardhan and Jha, 2013; Y ang et al., 2014; Azeko
et al., 2015; Kowalczyk et al., 2016; PaÁo et al., 2017; Sarmah
and Rout, 2018; Delacuvellerie et al., 2019). Some of these strains
showed the ability to utilize un-pretreated PE as a carbon source
based on the characterizations of bioﬁlm formation on PE ﬁlms,
weight loss of PE materials, surface deterioration, and changes
in the mechanical and thermal properties of PE ( Table 2). For
example, it was reported that the weight loss of un-pretreated
PE degraded by a strain Serratia marcescens reached 36% in an
incubation period of 70 days (Azeko et al., 2015). Moreover, two
cyanobacteria, Phormidium lucidum and Oscillatoria subbrevis ,
exhibited the capability of degrading 30% of the initial weight
of tested PE over a 42-day period (Sarmah and Rout, 2018).
However, these promising reports of PE degradation based on
weight loss are less convincing since there is no additional
evidence to support that the weight loss is caused by the

degradation of the long-chain PE other than the low molecular
weight components in PE.
Notably, a few studies reported that the waxworms, possessing
an inherent ability to feed on and digest beeswax, could chew,
and eat PE ﬁlms (Y ang et al., 2014; Bombelli et al., 2017; Chalup
et al., 2018; Kundungal et al., 2019). The biodegradation of PE
has been detected through contact with the homogenate of the
waxworm Galleria mellonella (Bombelli et al., 2017) or after
passage through the gut of the lesser waxworm Achroia grisella
(Kundungal et al., 2019), according to the changes in chemical
compositions characterized by the analyses of Fourier transform
infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance
(NMR). However, further investigations are necessitated in order
to determine whether the depolymerization of PE has occurred in
the waxworm gut.
As intestinal microbial symbionts have been recognized as in-
dispensable for the digestion of insects (Engel and Moran, 2013),
we have hypothesized that the microbial symbionts in the
waxworm gut also play an important part in the degradation
of PE (Y ang et al., 2014). Two bacterial strains, Enterobacter
asburiae YT1 and Bacillus sp. YP1, were isolated from the
gut of waxworm Plodia interpunctella , and their PE-degrading
capability was documented within a limited incubation period
of 60 days based on the characterizations of bioﬁlm formation,
changes in the PE physical properties (tensile strength and surface
topography), chemical structure (hydrophobicity and appearance
of carbonyl groups), molecular weight (accompanied by the
formation of daughter products), and weight loss ( Table 2 ).
These ﬁndings indicated that the bacteria from waxworms could
be a promising source for the further screening PE-degrading
microbes (Y ang et al., 2014; Y ang et al., 2015a).
Although a diverse range of PE-degrading microbes has been
reported, only four microbial enzymes have been shown to be
responsible for PE degradation ( Table 2). Iiyoshi et al. (1998)

found that manganese peroxidase (MnP), from lignin-degrading
fungi Phanerochaete chrysosporium , could decrease the tensile
strength and average molecular weight of PE ﬁlm. Zhao et al.
(2004) also found that the combination of soybean peroxidase
(SBP) and hydrogen peroxide could oxidize the surface of
PE ﬁlm and diminish the surface hydrophobicity. Santo et al.
(2013) showed that the extracellular laccase secreted by the PE-
degrading bacterium, Rhodococcus ruber C208, could oxidize
the PE ﬁlms to generate carbonyl groups and decrease the
molecular weight. While these past studies have identiﬁed the
above peroxidase and laccase to be capable of catalyzing the
degradation of PE, their catalytic mechanisms in the process of
microbial degradation of PE remained unclear. In addition, three
alkane hydroxylase genes, alkB, alkB1, and alkB2, were cloned in
Escherichia coli and the resulting recombinant strains were found
to be able to degrade low molecular-weight PE ( Table 2; Yoon
et al., 2012; Jeon and Kim, 2015, 2016a). These results indicated
that the alkB, alkB1, or alkB2 played a key role in the degradation
of low molecular-weight PE. Additionally, a recent study based
on quantum mechanics calculations also suggested that the
enzymatic cleavage of carbonñcarbon bonds of polyoleﬁns (PE
and PS) by oxidases or oxygenases was possible (Xu et al.,
2019). However, future eﬀorts are required to characterize the
biochemical functions of the oxidases or oxygenases, such as the
enzymes encoded by the genes alkB, alkB1, or alkB2, within the
biodegradation of PE.
PS
Guillet et al. (1974) ﬁrst used two types of 14C-PS ( α- and
β-14C) as substrates to assess microbial degradation of PS in
both soil and activated sewage sludge, and they showed that
less than 0.01% could be degraded to 14CO2 in the course of
8 weeks. Afterward, 14C-labeled PS was also used as a substrate
to determine the degradation of PS by soil microbiota, 17 lignin-
degrading fungi, and ﬁve mixed ﬂoras (Sielicki et al., 1978; Kaplan
et al., 1979). According to the release of 14CO2, the degradation
rate was only 1.5 ∼3.0% during 16 weeks, up to 0.24% within
5 weeks, and 0.04 ∼0.57% within 11 weeks (Sielicki et al., 1978;
Kaplan et al., 1979).
Besides the mixed ﬂora, researchers have also tried to
isolate PS-degrading microbes from diﬀerent environment
samples ( Table 3). Eisaku et al. (2003) reported that three soil
microorganisms, Xanthomonas sp., Sphingobacterium sp., and
Bacillus sp. STR-YO, could degrade PS. Mor and Sivan (2008)
found that an actinomycete, Rhodococcus ruber C208, was able to
utilize PS as its sole carbon source to grow, and this led to a weight
loss of 0.8% within 8 weeks. In addition, three fungi and three
bacteria were isolated from the soil-buried expanded PS ﬁlms,
and they could adhere and grow on PS (Table 3; Atiq et al., 2010;
Atiq, 2011). However, the reported biodegradation rates of PS by
these strains was quite low, and there was no evidence of changes
in either the physical or chemical properties of its long-chain PS
molecules after microbial degradation.
Extraordinarily, mealworms (larvae of Tenebrio molitor) were
reported to be able to eat and rapidly degrade up to 50% of
ingested Styrofoam (trade name of PS foam) during 24 h, and this
was supported by the change in chemical composition, reduction
in molecular weight, and the isotopic trace after passage through
the intestinal tract (Y ang et al., 2015b). With the same protocols,
the PS-degrading capability was also documented in a broader
range of mealworms from 12 diﬀerent locations worldwide,
indicating that PS degradation in mealworms is ubiquitous (Y ang
et al., 2018). This discovery also inspired researchers to explore
more insect species, such as dark mealworms (Tenebrio obscurus)
(Peng et al., 2019) and superworms ( Zophobas atratus ) (Y ang
et al., 2020), that also could eat and degrade PS.
We wondered whether the microbial symbionts associated
with mealworms and superworms contributed to the degradation
of PS. While the gut microbial symbionts were suppressed
with antibiotics, the PS-degrading capacity of mealworms
or superworms was impaired. This result indicated that
gut microbial symbionts played an important role in the
biodegradation of ingested Styrofoam (Y ang et al., 2015c, Y ang
et al., 2020). Furthermore, one strain of Exiguobacterium sp.
YT2, isolated from the gut of Tenebrio molitor , was proven
to be capable of degrading 7.5% weight of PS in vitro within
60 days, while the decrease in molecular weight of the residual
PS pieces and the release of water-soluble daughter products
were also detected (Y ang et al., 2015c; Table 3). At the time of
writing, more bacteria have been isolated from the gut of plastic-
eating mealworms or superworms, and their potential for PS
degradation is still under assessment (Xia et al., 2019).
With respect to the PS-degrading enzymes, only
hydroquinone peroxidase, secreted by a lignin-degrading

Ru et al. Microbial Degradation and Valorization of Plastic Wastes
bacterium Azotobacter beijerinckii HM121, was able to
depolymerize PS into low molecular products in the
presence of non-aqueous medium of dichloromethane
(Nakamiya et al., 1997).
PP
In 1993, microbial degradation of PP was ﬁrstly assessed by
cultures enriched from sandy soils containing PE wastes (Cacciari
et al., 1993). After an incubation period of 175 days, the
amount of degradation products, which were extracted with
methylene chloride, accounted for 40% of the initial weight
of tested PP. However, 90% of the extracted products were
identiﬁed as aromatic esters, which were derived from the
plasticizers, a chemical added especially into plastic to adjust the
ﬂexibility, workability, or stretchability. Meanwhile, only 10% of
the extracted products were identiﬁed as hydrocarbons (C 10H22
to C31H64) that may be derived from the degradation of PP itself.
This result indicated that the plasticizers, other than the PP itself,
were prone to be degraded by the sandy soil microorganisms
(Cacciari et al., 1993).
From that time on, several microorganisms from diﬀerent
environmental samples have been tested for their potential to
degrade PP (Table 4). For example, when PP ﬁlms were incubated
with soil microbiota from a plastic-dumping site, 0.4% weight
loss and 33% increase in the crystallinity of residual PP were
observed after 12 months, implying that the amorphous parts of
PP could be degraded by soil microbiota (Arkatkar et al., 2009).
Additionally, it was found that three bacteria and two fungal
strains ( Table 4 ), isolated from the soil of a plastic-dumping
site, could utilize PP as their carbon source for growth and
degrade 0.05ñ5% of PP after incubation for 12 months (Arkatkar
et al., 2010; Jeyakumar et al., 2013). Mixed consortia of four
bacterial isolates, from waste management landﬁlls and sewage
treatment plants, could also degrade the PP strips and pellets with
a weight loss of 44.2ñ56.3% after 140 days (Skariyachan et al.,
2018). Moreover, two marine bacteria ofBacillus sp. strain 27 and
Rhodococcus sp. strain 36, isolated from mangrove environments,
were also able to grow in aqueous synthetic media containing PP
microplastics and caused a weight loss of 4.0ñ6.4% after 40 days
(Auta et al., 2018). However, it is hard to determine whether the
weight loss caused by the reported microbes above was attributed
to the depolymerization of the long-chain PP or the degradation
of the low molecular weight components, as the analyses of
changes in molecular weight were absent.
A mesophilic strain, Stenotrophomonas panacihumi PA3-2,
isolated from the soil of an open storage yard for municipal
solid waste, was reported to be able to degrade two kinds of
low molecular weight PP (Mn: 2,800, 3,600 Da) and one high
molecular weight PP (Mn: 44,000 Da) with a biodegradability
of 12.7ñ20.3% in terms of CO 2 release and an increase in the
molecular weight after 90 days (Jeon and Kim, 2016b). The results
indicated that this strain could only degrade the low molecular
weight fractions rather than the long-chain PP.
Until now, there are no enzymes reported to be capable of
degrading PP , and little knowledge is available for the mechanism
of microbial degradation of PP (Arutchelvi et al., 2008).
However, similar to PE, it was found that the physicochemical
pretreatments, including γ-irradiation (Alariqi et al., 2006),
UV irradiation (Jeyakumar et al., 2013), thermo-oxidation
(Jeyakumar et al., 2013), and blend with degradable additives,
could facilitate the microbial degradation of PP (Jeyakumar et al.,
2013; Jain et al., 2018).
PVC
Among all main kinds of synthetic plastics, PVC possesses the
highest proportion of plasticizer (up to 50%). As plasticizers
can be utilized by many fungi or bacteria as sources of nutrient
carbons, plasticized PVC is usually susceptible to fungal or
bacterial attack (Berk, 1950; Berk et al., 1957; Bessems, 1988;
Kurane, 1988; Gumargalieva et al., 1999; Webb et al., 1999). For
instance, a number of plasticized PVC bathroom items, such as
bathtub lids, bath mats, and shower curtains, were found to be
damaged by a variety of fungi ( Table 5; Moriyama et al., 1993).
Several fungal isolates ( Table 5 ) from various environmental
samples, such as atmosphere (Webb et al., 2000), plasticized
PVC sheets buried in the grassland soil (Sabev et al., 2006; Ali
et al., 2014), and plastic wastes disposal sites (Khatoon et al.,
2019), also exhibited the ability to deteriorate the plasticized PVC.
In addition, a number of bacterial strains ( Table 5 ), isolated
from garden soil, landﬁll leachate, waste disposal sites, and
marine environments, have also been reported to be able to
degrade the plasticized PVC (Nakamiya et al., 2005; Latorre
et al., 2012; Anwar et al., 2016; Kumari et al., 2019; Giacomucci
et al., 2019). However, these abovementioned plasticized PVC-
degrading microorganisms just metabolized a component of the
plasticizer [such as bis (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate, DEHP] rather
than the backbone of PVC. Microorganisms capable of degrading
both PVC and plasticizers have not been discovered so far. Thus,
the key enzymes involved in the microbial degradation of PVC
are still unknown.
In future screening experiments, it is important to characterize
the ability of strains to depolymerize the long-chain molecules
of PVC by using virgin plastic in which low molecular weight
components (monomers, oligomers, and plasticizers) were
extracted by use of a suitable solvent or determining the decrease
in the average molecular weight and the broadening of the
molecular weight distribution of the residues after degradation.
PUR
PUR is the universal nomenclature for the plastic derived from
the condensation of polyisocyanates and polyols with the linkages
of intramolecular urethane bonds ( Table 1). Depending on the
chemical structures of the polyols used, PUR synthesized from
polyester polyol is designated as polyester PUR, while that
synthesized from polyether polyol is termed as polyether PUR.
In 1968, the initial research into microbial degradation of PUR
was made by Darby and Kaplan. They found that seven fungi
can grow on the surface of solid polyester PUR ( Table 6; Darby
and Kaplan, 1968). Since then, a number of fungi have been
proven to be able to degrade polyester PUR ( Table 6; Crabbe
et al., 1994; Cosgrove et al., 2007; Russell et al., 2011; Mathur
and Prasad, 2012; Álvarez-Barragán et al., 2016; Khan et al.,
2017; Osman et al., 2017; Magnin et al., 2019a). In addition to
fungi, many bacteria also have been demonstrated to be capable

Ru et al. Microbial Degradation and Valorization of Plastic Wastes
of degrading polyester PUR ( Table 6 ; Kay et al., 1991, 1993;
Nakajima-Kambe et al., 1995, 1997; Howard and Blake, 1998; Ii
et al., 1998; Howard et al., 1999, 2001a,b; Rowe and Howard,
2002; Oceguera-Cervantes et al., 2007; Gautam et al., 2007; Nair
and Kumar, 2007; Shah et al., 2008, 2013a,b, 2016; Howard
and Burks, 2012; Peng et al., 2014; Nakkabi et al., 2015a,b;
Pérez-Lara et al., 2016).
With regard to polyether PUR ( Table 6 ), it was much
less susceptible to microbial degradation in comparison to the
polyester PUR (Darby and Kaplan, 1968). Notwithstanding,
in 1979, Filip observed growth of Aspergillus niger and
Cladosporium herbarum in shake cultures with polyether PUR
resilient foam as the sole nutrient source (Filip, 1979). Afterward,
Jansen et al. isolated a strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis KH11
from an infected catheter and demonstrated its capacity to utilize
polyether PUR in the absence of any organic nutrients (Jansen
et al., 1991). In 2010, a fungus, Alternaria sp. PURDK2, was
reported to be able to degrade 27.5% of the weight of tested
polyether PUR foam in the Luria-Bertani (LB) glucose agar after
70 days. Furthermore, this fungus was also capable of degrading
two small molecule analogs of PUR, ethylphenylcarbamate (EPC)
and diphenylmethane-4,4 ′-dibutylurea (D-MDI), into aniline
and ethanol, indicating that the fungus could secret urethane-
bondñdegrading enzymes (Matsumiya et al., 2010). In 2016,
eight fungal strains ( Table 6 ) were showed be able to grow
in mineral medium with a polyether PUR varnish as the sole
carbon source and degrade 65% of solid polyether PUR foams
in 50% potato dextrose broth (PDB) over 21 days (Álvarez-
Barragán et al., 2016). Stepien et al. found that three bacteria
and one yeast ( Table 6 ) could degrade commercial polyether
PUR ﬁlms (Tecoﬂex
R⃝) and cause a weight loss of 2.8ñ10.5%
within 5 months (Stepien et al., 2017). Oprea et al. assessed the
biodegradability of pyridine-based polyether PUR elastomers by
a fungus Alternaria tenuissima, and found that the fungus could
decrease the mechanical properties and deteriorate the surface
morphology after 60 days (Oprea et al., 2018).
The genes and enzymes contributing to microbial degradation
of polyester PUR have been widely investigated ( Table 6). In
1994, Crabbe et al. puriﬁed an esterase from a polyester PUR-
degrading fungus, Curvularia senegalensis, and showed that this
esterase can cleavage the ester bonds in the soft segments of
polyester PUR (Crabbe et al., 1994). While Akutsu et al. puriﬁed
a cell surface-bond polyester PUR-degrading esterase from the
polyester PUR-degrading bacterium Comamonas acidovorans
TB-35, Nomura et al. cloned a gene pudA encoding polyester
PUR-degrading esterase in this strain (Akutsu et al., 1998;
Nomura et al., 1998). Howard et al. puriﬁed a protease from
Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens (Vega et al., 1999), an esterase from
Comamonas acidovorans (Allen et al., 1999), three esterases
from Pseudomonas chlororaphis (Howard et al., 1999; Ruiz
et al., 1999), and a lipase from Bacillus subtilis (Rowe and
Howard, 2002). All the puriﬁed serine hydrolases above have
the same hydrolytic capacity to emulsify polyester PUR. In
addition, they also cloned a gene named pulA from Pseudomonas
ﬂuorescens (Ruiz and Howard, 1999) and two genes, pueA and
pueB, from Pseudomonas chlororaphis (Stern and Howard, 2000;
Howard et al., 2001b). These genes encoded three diﬀerent
esterases involved in the microbial degradation of emulsiﬁed
polyester PUR by Pseudomonas ﬂuorescens and Pseudomonas
chlororaphis. In 2017, Schmidt et al. found that four polyester
hydrolases, LC cutinase, TfCut2, Tcur1278, and Tcur0390, were
able to degrade emulsiﬁed polyester PUR (Schmidt et al., 2017).
Among these three cutinase, LC cutinase caused weight losses
of up to 4.9 and 4.1% of two commercial polyester PUR
elastomers of Elastollan B85A-10 and C85A-10, respectively,
within a reaction time of 200 h at 70 ◦C. Recently, an esterase
(E3576), screened from 50 commercially available hydrolases,
was shown to be able to hydrolyze a waterborne polyester PUR
dispersion and degrade a solid polycaprolactone polyol-based
polyester PUR with weight loss of 33% after 51 days (Magnin
et al., 2019b). However, this esterase (E3576) cannot degrade
poly(hexamethylene adipate) diol-based polyester PUR ﬁlms,
indicating that the chemical structures of the polyol segments
signiﬁcantly aﬀect the biodegradability of polyester PUR (Kim
and Kim, 1998; Magnin et al., 2019b).
Although the above reported lipases or esterases were able to
rapidly degrade the emulsiﬁed polyester PUR (Impranil DLN) by
cleaving the ester bonds in the polyester polyols segments, they
exhibited a weak capability of degrading the solid polyester PUR
substrates, such as PUR ﬁlm, foam, and elastomer (Schmidt et al.,
2017). The degradation products were not identiﬁed, and the
biochemical mechanism was still unclear. Moreover, no speciﬁc
depolymerases have been reported to be able to degrade the
polyether PUR and cleave the urethane bones in both polyester
and polyether PUR.
PET
The purpose of initial eﬀorts to ﬁnd out the hydrolases capable
of hydrolyzing PET was to modify the surface wettability of
PET fabrics (Hsieh and Cram, 1998; Yoon et al., 2002; Gübitz
and Paulo, 2003; Alisch et al., 2004; Fischer-Colbrie et al., 2004;
O’Neill and Cavaco-Paulo, 2004; Zhang et al., 2004; Silva et al.,
2005; Vertommen et al., 2005). In the process of enzymatic
surface modiﬁcation, ester linkages on the surface of PET were
hydrolyzed to produce polar hydroxyl and carboxylic groups,
but the inner bulk of PET was not degraded. In a recent review
focusing on enzymatic degradation of PET, Kawai et al. deﬁned
those hydrolases with moderate surface-hydrolyzing capability as
PET surface-modifying enzymes (Kawai et al., 2019). By contrast,
the hydrolases with signiﬁcant capability of hydrolyzing the inner
bulk of PET (causing at least 10% weight loss) were termed asPET
hydrolases (Kawai et al., 2019). Hereinafter, only the reportedPET
hydrolases were reviewed (Table 7).
In 2005, Müller et al. (2005) reported that a cutinase-like
hydrolase TfH, from an actinomycete Thermobiﬁda fusca , can
eﬀectively degrade up to 50% of the initial weight of low-
crystallinity PET (lcPET, 9%) at 55 ◦C for 3 weeks. This is
the ﬁrst report on the enzymatic degradation of the inner
bulk of PET ﬁlms that opens the door for enzymatic PET
recycling in the future (Müller, 2006). Thereafter, Ronkvist
et al. compared the PET-hydrolyzing activities of three cutinases
from diﬀerent microorganisms, Humicola insolens (HiC, now
named Thermomyces insolens), Pseudomonas mendocina (PmC),
Frontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 9 April 2020 | Volume 11 | Article 442

Ru et al. Microbial Degradation and Valorization of Plastic Wastes
and Fusarium solani (FsC), using lcPET ﬁlms (7%) and high-
crystallinity biaxially oriented PET ﬁlms (hcPET, 35%) as
substrates (Ronkvist et al., 2009). Results showed that HiC caused
a 97% weight loss of lcPET ﬁlm (7%) at 70 ◦C within 96 h,
while PmC or FsC only led to a weight loss up to 5%. Thus,
HiC can be designated as PET hydrolase , while PmC and FsC
should be ascribed to PET surface-modifying enzymes . However,
the three cutinases could hardly hydrolyze the hcPET ﬁlms (35%).
After that, Sulaiman et al. (2012) found that a LC-cutinase,
encoded by one gene from the metagenomic library of leaf-
branch compost, can eﬃciently hydrolyze low-crystallinity PET
package ﬁlm (lcPET-P , 8.4%) at 50 ◦C and generate up to 50%
weight loss over 7 days. In addition, Kawai et al. found that a
cutinase Cut190, from Saccharomonospora viridis AHK190, can
hydrolyze the lcPET (7%) and lcPET-P (8.4%) at 63 ◦C, resulting
in a weight loss of 13.5 and 27.0% for lcPET and lcPET-P ,
respectively, over 3 days (Kawai et al., 2014). It was recently
shown that the recombinant Thermobiﬁda fusca cutinase TfCut2
expressed by B. subtilis could degrade the lcPET ﬁlms (7%) with a
weight loss up to 97.0% and two low-crystallinity PET samples
from postconsumer packages (AP-PET, 5%; CP-PET, 6%) with
maximum weight losses of 50.5 and 56.6%, respectively, within
120 h at 70◦C (Wei et al., 2019a).
Remarkably, Yoshida et al. found a bacterium, Ideonella
sakaiensis 201-F6, capable of degrading lcPET ﬁlms (1.9%) at
an ambient temperature, and they identiﬁed a PET-hydrolyzing
enzyme, termed as IsPETase, from this bacterium (Yoshida et al.,
2016). The IsPETase was heat-labile (20 ∼45◦C) and exhibited
greater PET degradation activity than the above reported PET
hydrolases at a mesophilic temperature of 30 ◦C (Yoshida et al.,
2016; Taniguchi et al., 2019). Nevertheless, the degradation rate
of lcPET ﬁlm (7%) by IsPETase at 30◦C over a 24 h-incubation
period was only 1% (weight loss), which was markedly lower
than that caused by the above reported PET hydrolases at
a thermophilic temperature (50 ∼70◦C) (Wei et al., 2019a,b).
Moreover, the hydrolytic activity of IsPETase against lcPET ﬁlms
(1.9%) was obviously higher than that for hcPET ﬁlms (30∼40%)
(Y ang et al., 2016; Yoshida et al., 2016).
Overall, the above reported PET hydrolases are prone to
degrade the lcPET (<10%) but not the hcPET (Vertommen et al.,
2005; Ronkvist et al., 2009; Y ang et al., 2016; Yoshida et al.,
2016; Wei et al., 2019a). The eﬀect of diﬀerent crystallinity on
the enzymatic degradation could be explained by the changes
in the macromolecular aggregate structures of the polymer.
Polymer molecules generally pack together in a non-uniform
way with a mixture of ordered regions (crystalline-like) and
disordered domains (amorphous). As the polymer chains in the
amorphous domains are less densely packed than those in the
crystalline domains, the lcPET, comprising a high proportion
of amorphous domains, is more susceptible to enzymatic
degradation. However, the high-crystallinity PET (30 ∼40%)
represents the most abundant types of postconsumer plastic, and
methods for lowering the crystallinity of PET to enhance the
enzymatic degradation are highly sought.
Additionally, the enzymatic hydrolytic reactions of PET are
inclined to take place under the temperature close to the
glass transition temperature of PET ( Tg, 65 ∼75◦C). Under
such a thermophilic temperature, the polymer chains in the
amorphous PET domains can gain enough mobility to access
the active sites of PET hydrolases (Ronkvist et al., 2009;
Wei and Zimmermann, 2017a; Kawai et al., 2019). As a result,
it suggests that eﬃcient enzymatic degradation of PET requires
thermostable PET depolymerases. Approaches of glycosylation
(Shirke et al., 2018) and rational protein engineering, such as the
optimization of surface salt bridge (Shirke et al., 2016), mutation
of Ca2+and Mg2+binding sites (Then et al., 2015), introduction
of disulﬁde bridge (Then et al., 2016), stabilization of a β6-β7
connecting loop, and extension of subsite IIc (Son et al., 2019),
have been applied to improve the thermostability of these PET
hydrolases. Notwithstanding, there is room for increasing the
half-life of PET hydrolases above 65◦C.
MICROBIAL VALORIZATION OF PLASTIC
WASTES
The initial step of the microbial degradation process is to
secrete depolymerases to break down the long-chain polymers
into low molecular weight oligomers or monomers, which
can be further assimilated into microbial cells or metabolized
into CO 2. According to the principle of circular economy,
these depolymerization products could be exploited for the
biosynthesis of high-value chemicals through speciﬁc metabolic
pathways, which could be considered as a way of valorizing plastic
wastes (Wierckx et al., 2015).
From TPA, EG, and 6-Hydroxyhexanoate
to Succinic Acids and
Polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA)
Enzymatic hydrolysis of PET could release constituent
monomers ethylene glycol (EG), terephthalic acid (TPA),
mono(ethylene terephthalate) (MHET), and bis(2-
hydroxyethyl)TPA (BHET) by cleaving the ester bond (Ronkvist
et al., 2009; Yoshida et al., 2016). Among these products, MHET
could be further degraded into TPA and EG by the action of
MHETase (Figure 2; Yoshida et al., 2016; Palm et al., 2019). In
addition, the ester linkages in polycaprolactone polyol-based
PUR (PCL-based PUR) could be hydrolyzed by an esterase
(E3576) to generate 6-hydroxyhexanoate (Magnin et al., 2019b).
These products could be further metabolized by speciﬁc
microorganisms through diﬀerent metabolic pathways (Figure 2;
Brzostowicz et al., 2003; Yoshida et al., 2016).
In bacterial species, a TPA transporter is implicated in
the transport of TPA into the cell (Hosaka et al., 2013).
Once inside the cell, the TPA can be transformed into
1,6-dihydroxycyclohexa-2,4-diene-dicarboxylate (DCD) by
the activity of the TPA dioxygenase (TPADO). DCD is
further oxidized by the 1,2-dihydroxy-3,5-cyclohexadiene-1,4-
dicarboxylate dehydrogenase (TphB) to form protocatechuate
(PCA) (Figure 2; Wang et al., 1995; Choi et al., 2005; Sasoh et al.,
2006). The PCA could be degraded by the ortho-, meta-, and
para-cleavage pathways under the catalysis of 3,4-dioxygenase
(PCDO), 4,5-dioxygenase, and 2,3-dioxygenase, respectively

(Harwood and Parales, 1996). Of these, the ortho-cleavage
pathway has been thoroughly studied. The resulting metabolite,
β-carboxymuconate (CM), will eventually be converted into
acetyl-CoA and succinyl-CoA, which can enter the tricarboxylic
acid (TCA) cycle to generate succinic acid (Figure 2).
In 2008, Kenny et al. ﬁrst isolated three microorganisms,
Pseudomonas putida GO16, Pseudomonas putida GO19, and
Pseudomonas frederiksbergensis GO23, which could utilize TPA
for not only growth but also accumulation of medium chain
length PHA (mclPHA). Subsequently, they used the TPA fraction
from PET pyrolysis as the feedstock for microbial production of
mclPHA by these Pseudomonas species. The maximal production
rate of PHA reached approximately 8.4 mg ·l−1 ·h−1 (Kenny
et al., 2008). When TPA and glycerol waste from biodiesel
manufacture were co-supplied to Pseudomonas putida GO16
in a fed-batch bioreactor, the production rate of PHA reached
approximately 108.8 mg ·l−1 ·h−1 (Kenny et al., 2012).
EG could be metabolized by many kinds of microorganisms
through two diﬀerent pathways ( Figure 2 ). In the pathway of
acetogens, EG is degraded to ethanol and acetaldehyde, which
is eventually transformed to acetate via acetyl-CoA (Trifunovi ´c
et al., 2016). In contrast, through the pathway of Pseudomonas
aeruginosa, EG is initially oxidized into glycolate by a series
of dehydrogenases, and the generated glycolate will be further
transformed into glyoxylate by the glycolate oxidase (GlcDEF).
Glyoxylate could be converted into glycerate, which ﬁnally forms
pyruvate (Figure 2; Child and Willetts, 1978; Kataoka et al., 2001).
P. putida KT2440 could accumulate mclPHA under nitrogen-
limiting conditions but could not eﬃciently utilize EG as its
sole carbon source. Through adaptive laboratory evolution,
one mutant of P. putida KT2440 that could utilize EG as
its sole carbon source was isolated. Comparative genomic
analyses between the wild strain and the mutant revealed
that a transcriptional regulator, GclR, played a central role
in repressing the glyoxylate carboligase pathway (Li et al.,
2019). With this knowledge, Franden et al. (2018) demonstrated
that the overexpression of a combination of the glyoxylate
carboligase (Gcl) operon with the glycolate oxidase (GlcDEF)
operon endowed P. putida KT2440 with the ability to utilize EG
as a sole carbon source for growth and accumulate in nitrogen-
limiting M9 medium.
As for 6-hydroxyhexanoate, the hydrolysis product of PCL-
based PUR, it is ﬁrst converted to 6-oxohexanoic by the
6-hydroxyhexanoate dehydrogenase (ChnD). 6-oxohexanoic is
eventually transformed into adipate by the action of the
6-oxohexanoic dehydrogenase (ChnE). After ligation with CoA,
the adipate will be further converted to 3-oxoadipyl-CoA,
which ﬁnally forms succinyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA that enter
the TCA cycle with the production of succinic acid ( Figure 2 ;
Brzostowicz et al., 2003).
From Aromatic Hydrocarbons to
Succinic Acids and PHA
Styrene, the aromatic monomer of PS, could be generated from
the PS pyrolysis in the absence of air (Kaminsky and Kim,
1999) and is directly utilized as a carbon source by many
microorganisms via two diﬀerent catabolic pathways ( Figure 2;
O’Leary et al., 2002).
The ﬁrst one is the direct aromatic ring cleavage pathway
(Figure 2 ). In this pathway, the aromatic ring of styrene is
ﬁrstly hydroxylated to styrene cis-glycol by styrene dioxygenase
(SDO). Styrene cis-glycol is then further oxidized by a cis-
glycol dehydrogenase (CGDH) to form 3-vinylcatechol. This
product is degraded into pyruvate, which is further converted
to acetyl-CoA by the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDHC).
Acetyl-CoA will ﬁnally enter the TCA cycle to generate succinic
acid or be transformed into acetoacetyl-CoA, which could
form β-D-Hydroxybutyryl-CoA or could be converted to PHA
by an acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (PhaB) or a PHA synthase
(PhaC), respectively (Anderson and Dawes, 1990). The other
styrene metabolism pathway involves vinyl side-chain oxidation
(Figure 2 ). Styrene is ﬁrst converted into phenylacetic acid
(PAA) by several enzymes, such as styrene monooxygenase
(SMO), styrene oxide isomerase (SOI), and phenylacetaldehyde
dehydrogenase (PAALDH). PAA is further hydroxylated and
passed through the β-oxidation process to yield acetyl-CoA,
which will then enter the TCA cycle or be converted into PHA
(O’Leary et al., 2005; Oelschlägel et al., 2018).
In 2005, Ward et al. ﬁrst found that Pseudomonas putida
CA-3 could convert the metabolite of styrene, PAA, into
polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) when a limiting concentration
of nitrogen was added to the growth medium. Their ﬁnding
built the metabolic link between styrene degradation and PHA
accumulation in P. putida CA-3 and found a trail for the
microbial valorization of PS waste into valuable chemicals (Ward
et al., 2005; Nikodinovic-Runic et al., 2011).
Afterward, Ward et al. (2006) used the styrene oil, the pyrolysis
products of PS waste at 520 ◦C in a ﬂuidized bed reactor, as the

Ru et al. Microbial Degradation and Valorization of Plastic Wastes
sole source of carbon and energy to support the growth and PHA
accumulation of P. putida CA-3 in the shake ﬂask experiments.
In a run, the transformation rate from PS waste to PHA was 10%.
In order to improve the conversion rate, Goﬀ et al. performed a
batch fermentation of P. putida CA-3 grown on styrene oil in a
stirred tank reactor with an optimized nitrogen feeding strategy
(Goﬀ et al., 2007).
From Aliphatic Hydrocarbons to Fatty
Acids, PHA, and Biosurfactants
Although PE, PP , and PVC, with similar carbonñcarbon
backbone chains, have been shown to be degraded by a number
of microorganisms, the key depolymerases involved in the
degradation process and the resulting depolymerization products
remain unknown. However, pyrolysis in the absence of air could
be an alternative method that can eﬀectively depolymerize those
plastic wastes into low molecular weight aliphatic hydrocarbons
(Aguado et al., 2002).
It has been reported that the pyrolytic hydrocarbons of
PE can be degraded via a terminal oxidation process similar
to the microbial degradation pathway of n-alkane ( Figure 2 ;
Yoon et al., 2012; Jeon and Kim, 2015, 2016a). This process
starts by the oxidation of a terminal methyl group by an
alkane hydroxylase (AH) to generate a primary alcohol, which
is further oxidized by an alcohol dehydrogenase (AD) to
the corresponding aldehyde and ﬁnally converted into fatty
acids by an aldehyde dehydrogenase (ADL) (Rojo, 2009). Fatty
acids are then conjugated to CoA by an acyl-CoA synthase
and further processed by β-oxidation to produce acetyl-CoA,
L-β-hydroxyacyl-CoA, and trans-2-decenoyl-CoA ( Figure 2 ).
Acetyl-CoA can enter the TCA cycle to generate succinic acid
or acetoacetyl-CoA, which can be ﬁnally converted to PHA
under the appropriate condition (Anderson and Dawes, 1990).
The L-β-hydroxyacyl-CoA is isomerized into D- β-hydroxyacyl-
CoA, which can ﬁnally be converted into PHA through a
PHA synthase (PhaC) (Sabirova et al., 2006). In addition, the
trans-2-decenoyl-CoA is hydrated by the R-speciﬁc enoyl-CoA
hydratase (RhlYZ) to form R-3-hydroxydecanoyl-CoA, which
then acts as the direct lipid precursor used by the R-3-((R-
3-hydroxyalkanoyl)oxy) alkanoic acids (HAA) synthase (RhlA)
for the synthesis of HAAs. HAA, combined with dTDP-L-
rhamnoses, can be converted into rhamnolipid biosurfactants by
the rhamnosyltransferase 1 (RhlB) and the rhamnosyltransferase
2 (RhlC) (Abdel-Mawgoud et al., 2014).
Guzik et al. (2014) ﬁrst used the pyrolytic hydrocarbons
of PE as the starting material for microbial fermentation to
produce PHA. Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO-1, tested from
23 bacterial strains capable of degrading hydrocarbons or
producing PHA, was reported to be able to accumulate
PHA with almost 25% of cell dry weight when supplied
with PE pyrolytic hydrocarbons and biosurfactants. Another
bacterial strain, Ralstonia eutropha H16 (previously known as
Cuprivadus necator or Wausternia eutropha), also exhibited PHA
accumulation when supplied with non-oxygenated PE pyrolytic
hydrocarbons as a carbon source in a nitrogen-rich tryptone
soya broth (TSB) growth medium (Johnston et al., 2017). In
contrast to PE pyrolysis in the absence of air, pyrolysis in the
presence of air would not only cleave the long chains of PE
but also introduce the carbonyl and hydroxyl groups into the
backbone of pyrolytic hydrocarbons, which could improve the
bioavailability of pyrolytic hydrocarbons as a carbon source for

Ru et al. Microbial Degradation and Valorization of Plastic Wastes
microbial fermentation to produce PHA by the strain Ralstonia
eutropha H16 (Radecka et al., 2016).
In addition, PP could also be depolymerized into branched
chain fatty alcohols and alkenes by pyrolysis. In 2019, Mihreteab
et al. reported that strain Yarrowia lipolytica 78-003 was able
to convert such depolymerization products to value-added fatty
acids when mixed with biosurfactants and trace nutrients. During
a period of 312 h, Y. lipolytica 78-003 assimilated more than 80%
of the substrate and produced up to 492 mg L −1 lipids mainly
composed of C 16-C18 unsaturated fatty acids (Mihreteab et al.,
2019). Johnston et al. (2019) found that R. eutropha H16 could
utilize oxidized PP fragments as an additional carbon source to
produce PHA in TSB medium.
As for PVC, although the pyrolysis at 300◦C in the N2 ﬂow has
been showed to be able to depolymerize PVC into hydrocarbons
along with the dechlorination in the form of HCl (Yuan et al.,
2014), there are no reports about microbial strains that can utilize
PVC pyrolysis products as carbon source so far. However, as these
products are of similar chemical compositions to those of PE and
PP , it is justiﬁable to believe that the strains of P. aeruginosa ,
R. eutropha H16, and Yarrowia lipolytica 78-003, which are able
to assimilate the pyrolysis hydrocarbons of PE and PP , could also
utilize PVC pyrolysis products to produce valuable chemicals.
Microbial growth on hydrocarbons is often associated
with the production of biosurfactant, which can emulsify
the hydrophobic hydrocarbons in aqueous media to increase
the bioavailability of hydrocarbons to the cells. For instance, the
strain Renibacterium salmoninarum 27BN was found to be able to
produce rhamnolipids when grown on n-hexadecane (Christova
et al., 2004). An oil-degrading bacterium Dietzia maris As-13-3,
isolated from deep sea hydrothermal ﬁeld, could also produce di-
rhamnolipid as a biosurfactant, while tetradecane, n-hexadecane,
and pristine were utilized as sole carbon sources (Wang et al.,
2014). These results imply that pyrolysis hydrocarbons of PE,
PP , and PVC could also be utilized as feedstocks to produce
biosurfactants by these known hydrocarbon-degrading and
biosurfactant-producing microorganisms.
CONCLUDING REMARKS AND FUTURE
PROSPECTS
As described above, a number of plastic-degrading
microorganisms and enzymes have been sourced from the
environment. However, an understanding of depolymerases
contributing to the breakdown of plastics remains scarce.
Therefore, future eﬀorts should be devoted to identifying more
depolymerases from the plastic-degrading microorganisms. In
addition, enhancing the eﬃciency of enzymatic degradation
is a big challenge. On the one hand, the macromolecular
aggregate structures of plastics, such as the crystalline
structures and cross-linking networks, impede the enzymatic
degradation. The development of physical pretreatments,
such as mechanical grinding and γ-irradiations, may help
disorder these macromolecular aggregate structures and improve
enzymatic degradation (Alariqi et al., 2006). On the other
hand, approaches of rational protein engineering and direction
evolution are necessary to improve the activity and stability of
depolymerases, which will beneﬁt the enhancement of enzymatic
degradation eﬃciency.
While the long-chain polymer molecules could have been
eﬀectively depolymerized into small subunits (monomers or
oligomers) by depolymerases, these small depolymerization
products would be incorporated into cells as the feedstocks
for metabolism ( Table 8 ). Based on the advances in the
understanding of the depolymerases and the microbial metabolic
pathways of depolymerization products, it is fascinating to
apply synthetic biology to build microbial cell factories
that could depolymerize plastic wastes and utilize the small
depolymerization products to produce chemicals with high value
(Wierckx et al., 2015; Salvador et al., 2019; Blank et al., 2020).
If this is manageable, it would not only contribute to the
disposal of plastic wastes but also establish an improved cyclic
utilization of plastics.
