The use of protein engineering to generate enzymes for the degradation of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is a 
promising route for plastic recycling, yet traditional engineering approaches often fail to explore protein sequence 
space for optimal enzymes. In this work, we use multiplexed ancestral sequence reconstruction (mASR) to address 
this, exploring the evolutionary sequence space of PET- degrading cutinases. Using 20 statistically equivalent phy-
logenies of the bacterial cutinase family, we generated 48 ancestral sequences revealing a wide range of PETase 
activities, highlighting the value of mASR in uncovering functional variants. Our findings show PETase activity can 
evolve through multiple pathways involving mutations remote from the active site. Moreover, analyzing the PETase 
fitness landscape with local ancestral sequence embedding (LASE) revealed that LASE can capture sequence fea-
tures linked to PETase activity. This work highlights mASR’s potential in exploration of sequence space and under-
scores the use of LASE in readily mapping the protein fitness landscapes.
INTRODUCTION
More than 350 million tonnes of plastic are produced annually, with 
the majority being derived from petrochemicals (1 ). However, the 
current global recycling rate of plastics is estimated to be less than 
10%, partially due to the technological constraints of mechanical 
(melt- extrusion) recycling (2). There is a pressing need to develop 
advanced and scalable recycling methods that will enable the transi-
tion toward a circular plastic economy. In the past decade, enzymatic 
depolymerization of plastics has emerged as one such advanced recy-
cling method (3). The enzymatic degradation of polyethylene tere-
phthalate (PET), a versatile thermoplastic commonly found in food 
and beverage packaging, and polyester textiles has received particu-
lar interest (3).
PET- degrading enzymes that have been characterized to date—
including those classified as cutinases (4–6) (EC 3.1.1.74), lipases (7) 
(EC 3.1.1.3), and carboxylesterases (8 ) (EC 3.1.1.1)—belong to the 
esterase subclass (EC 3.1) and are characterized by a catalytic triad 
(Ser- His- Asp) typical of the α/β hydrolase fold superfamily. Cutinases 
have garnered substantial interest due to their ability to hydrolyse 
both aromatic and aliphatic polyesters (9). Cutinases of bacterial (5, 
9, 10), fungal (7), and metagenomic (11–13) origins have been studied 
for their PETase activity, including Thc_Cut1 and Thc_Cut from 
Thermobifida cellulosilytica (5), TfCut2 from Thermobifida fusca (5), 
HiC from Humicola insolens (14), FsC from Fusarium solani pisi (15), 
and leaf- branch compost cutinase (LCC) from leaf- branch compost 
metagenome (16). However, extant cutinases are often unsuitable for 
direct use in industrial processes, necessitating optimization to im-
prove properties such as catalytic efficiency (17), stability under harsh 
conditions (18, 19), and to alleviate product inhibition (20). For ex-
ample, active site optimization through rational design (6, 10, 21) and 
evolutionarily guided engineering ( 20) has yielded substantial im -
provements in PET hydrolysis across various cutinase backgrounds. 
While structure- guided protein engineering has been effective in im-
proving the efficiency of extant PET hydrolases (PETases), it has 
provided little insight on the mechanisms by which PETase activity 
emerges or has been optimized by evolution.
Ancestral sequence reconstruction (ASR)—which uses a phylo-
genetic tree and a statistical model of evolution to infer the sequences 
of extinct, ancestral proteins—can provide critical insights into 
molecular evolution and functional diversification within protein 
families (22). ASR places sequences within the context of an evolu-
tionary hypothesis and reconstructs residues according to epistatic 
constraints that are conserved within phylogenetic lineages (23). Se-
quences reconstructed with ASR are therefore an effective explora-
tion of evolutionarily accessible sequence space. This has made ASR 
useful in studying sequence- function relationships over protein fam-
ilies (24, 25); this insight can shed light on the topologies of fitness 
landscapes that dictate the adaptive potential of proteins (26). For 
example, ASR can give insight into the ruggedness (i.e., complexity) 
of a fitness landscape over large spans of evolutionarily accessible 
sequence space to reveal fitness peaks that are inaccessible through 
stepwise mutational approaches (25). In addition to this, ASR is also 
frequently used to engineer enzymes with enhanced industrial prop-
erties (22, 27–29), making it a valuable tool in both protein engineer-
ing and understanding the mechanisms of molecular evolution.
More recently, protein representation learning has become a widely 
used method in protein engineering and evolutionary inference 
(30, 31). Protein language models (PLMs), which are deep neural 
networks trained to predict the identities of masked residues in a 
corpus of protein sequences (30–33), can map information sparse 
and high dimensional protein sequences to fixed- length vector

representations. These vector representations capture the evolution-
ary and biophysical features of protein sequences in the representa-
tion model’s latent embedding space (30, 31). PLMs have been used 
to learn the structure of fitness landscapes (34–36) and can learn 
evolutionary features when trained with ancestral reconstructed se-
quence data (37).
In this study, we applied ASR to explore the evolutionarily acces-
sible sequence space of PET- degrading cutinases. Using a dataset of 
397 extant cutinase sequences with significant homology to known 
cutinases with PETase activity, we adopted a multiplexed ASR 
(mASR) approach to generate a diverse library of ancestral cutinase 
sequences. Through experimental characterization of 48 ancestral 
cutinases, we identified a broad range of PETase activities, including 
between equivalent nodes on distinct yet statistically indifferent 
phylogenetic topologies. These findings highlight the importance of 
sampling diverse phylogenetic backgrounds to uncover functional 
ancestral variants. Furthermore, our study analyzed the topology of 
the PETase fitness landscape through two sequence embedding 
schemes: one- hot encoding (OHE) and the more recently described 
local ancestral sequence embedding (LASE) (37). We found that 
LASE was more effective in capturing cutinase sequence features 
pertinent to PETase activity, demonstrating a clear pattern of itera-
tive improvement in PETase functionality throughout the sequence 
exploration phases of our study. This comprehensive approach not 
only highlights the utility of mASR in uncovering previously un-
known PETase variants but also emphasizes the role of advanced 
embedding techniques in mapping PETase fitness landscapes.
RESUL TS
mASR of PETases from diverse phylogenetic backgrounds
We used ASR to explore the PETase functional sequence space of 
the cutinase family. To maximize diversity in the local sequence 
space around known PETases, such as TfCut2 and LCC, we used the 
recently described mASR (37). In brief, mASR samples multiple sta-
tistically indifferent phylogenetic backgrounds from which to re-
construct ancestral sequences from. This produces diverse libraries 
of ancestral proteins that span functional sequence space over a dis-
tribution of realistic phylogenies. To achieve this, we performed 20 
replicates of maximum likelihood (ML) phylogenetic inference and 
ASR on a single dataset of 397 extant cutinases with significant ho-
mology to Tfcut2 and LCC (E value ≤ 1 × 10 −5). Consistent with 
previous phylogenetic studies ( 38), PET hydrolytic cutinases were 
resolved as a polyphyletic group of two monophyletic lineages: 
the Thermobifida sp. PETases, which include Tfcut2, Thermobifida 
cellulosytica cutinase, and Thermobifida alba  esterase 1 and the 
LCC- like PETases that include LCC and BhrPETase. This topology 
was resolved consistently over all 20 phylogenetic priors used for 
mASR (Fig. 1A). The placement of the PETase clades were supported 
by high ultra- fast bootstrap approximations (39) (≥0.95), and the 
ancestral nodes separating these groups were reconstructed in 
CodeML from the phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood 
(PAML) (40) suite with relatively high mean posterior probability 
[>0.9; based on ASR statistical benchmarking studies (41)]. The re-
sulting ancestral sequence library comprised approximately 1600 
unique sequences that encompassed the evolutionarily accessible 
sequence space of the bacterial cutinase family.
We selected 48 ancestral nodes from 20 different trees with ho-
mology to the most recent common ancestor of LCC and TfCut2 for 
experimental characterization and comparison to extant cutinases. 
Specifically, these nodes were chosen from the recent ancestors of the 
LCC and TfCut2 lineages (or the most recent common ancestor of 
both), with at least a single sequence sampled from each of the 20 
distinct phylogenetic trees. Each ancestral sequence was selected as 
the maximum a posteriori (MAP) sequence that maximizes the pos-
terior probability over the full length of the reconstructed protein. 
The variants were expressed, purified, and tested for PETase activity. 
The soluble expression level of each variant was measured using the 
Bradford assay (fig. S1). PETase activity against amorphous PET film 
was measured by ultraviolet (UV) absorbance at 260 nm (A 260 nm) 
to detect the soluble products of PET hydrolysis after the removal 
of undigested film, including terephthalic acid (TPA), mono(2-  
hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (MHET), and bis(2- hydroxyethyl) tere-
phthalate (BHET) (fig. S2). Among the extant cutinases, the highest 
PETase activities were observed for LCC (A 260 nm =  0.34 ±  0.03), 
BhrPETase from bacterium HR29 (A260 nm = 0.49 ± 0.01), and a pre-
viously engineered variant of LCC with the mutations F243I/D238C/
S283C/Y127G (LCC ICCG) (A260 nm = 0.54 ± 0.07) (6), with other 
cutinases showing lower activity (Fig. 1E). Of the 48 ancestral vari-
ants, we observed PETase activity for a number of ancestral cutinases 
from a diverse range of trees (Fig. 1F). Several variants (1_533, 
35_442, 55_547, 70_439, 70_440, and 85_456) exhibited similar 
activity to the most active extant cutinases, LCC and BhrPETase. 
From this group, we selected ancestors from tree 35, node 442 
(35_442; A260 nm = 0.37 ± 0.06) and tree 55, node 547 (55_547; A260 nm = 
0.59  ± 0.09), for further investigation. Notably, these two ances-
tors belonged to equivalent positions from two independent phylo-
genetic trees (Fig. 1, B to D), representing the most recent common 
ancestor of LCC and TfCut2 and sharing 98.5% sequence identity to 
one another.
Within the dataset of 48 ancestral sequences, 12 represent the 
same phylogenetic node (the most recent common ancestor of LCC 
and TfCut2) over 12 different phylogenetic backgrounds. Of these, 9 
exhibited PETase activity, while 3 were inactive on PET. The PETase 
ancestor 55_547 and the inactive ancestor 10_543 both represent 
equivalent positions (the most recent common ancestor of TfCut2 
and LCC) in their respective phylogenetic backgrounds and differ 
by only 9 of 261 positions, yet 55_547 has activity against PET and 
10_543 does not. The functional differences between these sequenc-
es arise solely from the topology of the phylogenetic tree used to 
reconstruct them and markedly alter how the evolution of PETase 
activity could be inferred. For example, in the case of the 55_547 
phylogeny, PETase activity appears to be a promiscuous ancestral 
trait that existed before the discovery of extant PETases (such as 
LCC and Thermobifida  cutinases), whereas the 10_543 phylogeny 
supports the contradictory hypothesis that PETase activity emerged 
independently in LCC- like and Thermobifida PETase lineages from 
an ancestor without PETase activity. As both topologies failed rejec-
tion by the approximately unbiased (AU) (42) test and are statisti-
cally indifferent at representing the observed alignment data, it is 
not possible to reject one of these hypotheses purely from a phyloge-
netic perspective. We also observe no correlation between the mean 
posterior probability of an ancestor and its activity (fig. S5). This 
observation is somewhat counterintuitive, as the mean posterior 
probability of a sequence, which is the statistical confidence in the 
identity of a reconstructed ancestor, is often used to discriminate 
between poorly reconstructed sequences (and hence likely to be less 
fit) and those that are likely to be functional and fit (41). Together,

these results highlight the importance of sampling diverse phyloge-
netic backgrounds during ASR when accessing the functional sequence 
space of a protein family as minor phylogenetic incongruencies can 
translate into substantial functional differences in (equivalent) re-
constructed ancestral sequences.
Structural characterization and analysis of 
ancestral cutinases
A comparative structural and sequence analysis of inactive and active 
ancestors suggests that PET hydrolysis appears to be a trait that is 
evolutionarily accessible from within the cutinase background. Un-
like the Ideonella sakaiensis PETase, which emerged through confor-
mational optimization of the first and second shells via obvious 
selection within the active site (43–45), PETase activity in the TfCut2 
and LCC PETase lineages appears to emerge through nonspecific 
and likely neutral mutations that are often distal to the active site 
(Fig. 2, A to C). Analysis of ancestral cutinase sequences reveals vir-
tually no differences in the PET binding sites between PETase active 
and inactive variants (fig. S6). Furthermore, mutations associated 
with a gain of function vary between the different phylogenetic trees 
used to reconstruct the ancestral sequences. For example, ancestors 
55_547 and 35_442 are each separated by nine unique mutations 
from their closest relatives without PETase activity (ancestors 10_543 
with A15S, A36V , T49S, T92S, N109D, R114S, N145R, I180V , S226A 
and 75_539 with A36V , T49D, T92S, M105Q, R114S, S124N, R167T, 
P199S, and A226S, respectively). Of these loss- of- function muta-
tions, three are shared between either background, five are unique, 
and one is a reversion (S226A for 55_547 and A226S for 35_442). 
Intuitively, a combination (with at least one) of these mutations is 
required to be fixed in either respective cutinase background to im-
part PETase activity. Similarly, ancestor 10_543 is separated by eight 
mutations from its closest relative with PETase activity (70_439 with 
E28Q, S49D, S124N, R145N, V180I, P199S, S215T, and A226S); of 
the eight mutations associated with gain of function in the back-
ground of 10_543, only three are specifically shared with gain- of- 
function mutations in 55_547. Nearly all functionally consequential

mutations across backgrounds are distal to the active site and PET 
binding pocket. This suggests that (i) there are numerous (and di-
verse) molecular mechanisms by which PETase activity can emerge 
from an ancestral cutinase without PETase activity, (ii) these mecha-
nisms are not obviously associated with a restructuring of the en-
zyme active site, and (iii) PETase activity is readily evolutionarily 
accessible within the cutinase family, consistent with recent observations 
of PETases that have emerged from cutinase backgrounds (11, 12).
We next determined the crystal structures of two active ances-
tors, 35_442 [Protein Data Bank (PDB) 8ETY] and 55_547 (PDB 
8ETX), and identified an additional pathway to optimizing PETase 
activity beyond modification of the active site. Both ancestors crys-
tallized in the C222 space group at resolutions of 1.5 to 1.8 Å (table 
S1). Structural analysis revealed the formation of domain- swapped 
dimers (Fig. 2D). The observation of domain swapping, likely in-
duced by the high protein concentration in the crystallization 
conditions, suggests an intrinsic flexibility of the C terminus, a char-
acteristic commonly observed in proteins previously characterized 
to form domain- swapped dimers (46). Given the flexible nature of 
the C terminus, it was hypothesized that introducing a disulfide 
bond to constrain this region into forming an intramolecular β sheet 
would enhance enzyme stability (Fig. 2E). Furthermore, the chosen 
site for the disulfide bond coincided with the predicted Ca 2+/Mg2+ 
binding site of the ancestors based on homology to extant cutinases, 
a region previously targeted for disulfide bond engineering in Tf-
Cut2 and LCC for improved thermostability and PETase activity 
(6, 47, 48). We introduced the disulfide mutation N206C/S253C to 
ancestor 55_547 and experimental characterization of the resulting 
mutant demonstrated an approximately twofold improvement in 
whole- cell activity (A 260 nm = 1.22  ± 0.22) (Fig. 2F) and a 1.5- fold 
increase in soluble expression levels compared to the 55_547 back-
ground determined by Bradford assay (fig. S5). In combination with 
our comparative analysis of the selected inactive and active ances-
tors, the successful optimization of PETase activity via the introduc-
tion of a disulfide bond distal to the active site illustrates that PETase 
activity within the cutinase family can emerge and be enhanced 
through mechanisms that extend beyond the structural reconfigura-
tion of the active site. It is therefore likely that activity optimization 
is, at least in part, being driven by thermodynamic and kinetic stabi-
lization.
Alternate reconstructions of ancestral cutinases 35_442 
and 55_547
We next experimentally characterized all alternate sequences of an-
cestors 55_547 (40 mutants) and 35_442 (29 mutants) that individu-
ally sampled each mutation that had been ambiguously reconstructed. 
Here, we define ambiguity as any site where at least two amino acids 
are reconstructed with a posterior probability of ≥ 0.2. All single 
mutations were introduced into the sequence of the node that was 
reconstructed ambiguously and typically represented conservative 
changes between physiochemically similar amino acids. This pro-
vided a high- resolution mutagenic map of the local sequence space 
around either of the ancestral PETase variants. Ambiguously recon-
structed sites were spatially distributed over the protein and not lo-
calized to any specific functional area (fig. S7). Having already 
established that the mean posterior probability of an ancestral se-
quence is a poor indicator of PETase activity (fig. S4B) and that relatively 
minor changes in the cutinase sequence can notably alter PETase 
activity, we hypothesized that the neighborhood of evolutionarily 
possible (albeit less probable) sequences may contain mutations that 
benefit PETase activity. This hypothesis was guided by recent ASR 
studies on the I. sakaiensis PETase branch of the cutinase phylogeny 
where PETase activity appeared to emerge transiently within ances-
tral lineages (38). Experimental characterization revealed that all of 
the alternate reconstructions of ancestors 55_547 and 35_442 dem-
onstrated PETase activity that was comparable (or reduced) to either 
respective ancestral background (Fig. 3, A and B).
A subset of randomly sampled combinations of single mutations 
from the alternate reconstructions were selected to explore potential 
epistatic interactions and their impact on PETase activity. The seven 
selected mutations—E14D, E28Q, A36V , S52A (in 55_547), F94L, 
S196A, and H247S—were recombined in various combinations from 
2 to 5 point mutations in the background of 35_442 and 55_547. 
E28Q, A36V , S52A, S196A, and H247S are surface mutations, distal 
from the catalytic and putative PET binding site (Fig. 4A). In con-
trast, F94L is positioned within the PET binding site, as deduced 
from docking of 2HE- (MHET)3 into both 35_442 and 55_547 
(Fig. 4A), as well as structural homology to previously predicted PET 
binding sites in LCC. As single mutations, E14D, E28Q, A36V , F94L, 
and H247S were considered neutral based on PETase activity relative 
to the 35_442 background, while S52A and S196A exhibited de-
creased activity relative to 55_547. In our experimental characteriza-
tion, we identified 24 recombined variants with increased PETase 
activity relative to their ancestral background (Fig. 4B). Specifically, 
10 recombined variants in the background of 55_547 showed in-
creased PETase activity, with the most active being E14D/E28Q/
A36V (A260 nm = 1.20 ± 0.26), E28Q/S196A (A260 nm = 1.08 ± 0.05), 
and E28Q/S52A/S196A (A260 nm = 1.03 ± 0.09). Similarly, 14 recom-
binations in the background of 35_442 demonstrated increased 
activity, with the most active being E28Q/S196A (A 260 nm   = 
1.42 ± 0.29), E28Q/F94L (A260 nm = 0.99 ± 0.17), and E14D/H247S 
(A260 nm = 0.77  ± 0.08). We identified 17 recombined variants that 
exhibited improved PETase activity relative to LCC ICCG, the most 
active extant variant in the study, with 35_442 E28Q/S196A, display-
ing ~2.5- fold higher activity.
The mutational analysis of the recombined variants highlighted 
E28Q as a key mutation, present in 14 of the 17 variants that dem-
onstrated enhanced activity compared to the engineered LCC ICCG 
variant. This suggests a positive effect of E28Q on PETase activity; 
however, this was only observed in the presence of other mutations 
from the recombinations. The context dependence of E28Q is especially 
important when considering the double mutation E28Q/S196A, which 
was among the most active in both ancestral backgrounds. When 
assessed independently in the 55_547 background, the E28Q mutation 
adversely affected activity (A260 nm = 0.00 ± 0.00), and the S196A mu-
tation similarly led to a reduction in activity relative to the ancestor 
(A260 nm = 0.16  ± 0.02). However, the combination of these muta-
tions resulted in an increase in activity beyond the additive effects of 
the single mutations (A 260 nm = 1.08  ± 0.05), indicative of positive 
epistatic interactions.
Ruggedness analysis of PETase fitness landscape
We next analyzed the topology of the PETase fitness landscape over 
the 196 cutinase sequences characterized in this study. This was 
done both to build a holistic overview of PETase evolution and func-
tion in the cutinase family and to assess the effectiveness of this ap-
proach in exploring new- to- nature fitness peaks across functional 
sequence space. To achieve this, we embedded cutinase sequences as

nodes in a network graph where edges connect each node to its k- 
nearest neighbors (kNNs) (Euclidean) neighbors. The scheme used 
to embed sequences therefore dictates the topology of the network 
graph. When this is the OHE, the Euclidean distance between nodes 
in the network graph is proportional to the number of mutations 
between the sequences they represent. The OHE graph network 
therefore captures PETase activity as a function of the mutations be-
tween sequences when the signal over the graph is the measured 
PETase activity (Fig. 5A).
Encoding protein sequences as the hidden states of a PLM can 
capture comparatively richer features than the OHE (30, 31), albeit 
at the cost of interpretability over the network graph (37). Euclidean 
distances in the latent space of a representation model may share no 
interpretable relationship with equivalent Euclidean distances in the 
OHE space, therefore confounding the interpretation of PETase ac-
tivity over the network graph to nonlinear distances instead of sim-
ple mutational distances.
We embedded all characterized cutinases in an OHE basis and 
visualized the resulting landscape in two dimensions with t- 
distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (tSNE) dimensionality 
reduction. Projection onto the two- dimensional tSNE basis did not 
meaningfully disrupt local structure in the full OHE basis according 
to the tSNE trustworthiness metric (0.92; lossless projection corre-
sponds to a score of 1.0) (49,  50), suggesting that clustering in the 
tSNE basis is not artifactual. In this space, ancestral and extant cu-
tinases form homogenous, random clusters. 35_442 and 55_547 
belong to distinct sequence clusters that are sparsely connected (Fig. 
5 and fig. S9), reflecting their disparate evolutionary backgrounds. 
The alternate reconstructions of ancestors 55_547 and 35_442 
and their recombinations are grouped as closely connected clusters 
around their respective ancestral backgrounds. Despite their 
comparable PETase activity, sequences in both backgrounds are re-
solved as independent components that share few direct edge 
connections, suggesting that the PETase fitness landscape is multi-
modal (i.e., there are multiple solution spaces to competent PETase 
activity) when considering only naive, residue- wise OHE sequence 
embeddings.
We then reconstructed the PETase fitness landscape in a learned 
representation space. To ensure that local features of the cutinase 
sequence space were captured by a PLM, we used a recently de-
scribed method of LASE (37). In brief, LASE trains a small and 
family- specific deep learning model on ancestral reconstructed se-
quence datasets. The features learned by LASE capture the function-
al properties of proteins, such as catalytic efficiency, in a nonlinear 
space that is not interpretable with simple mutational distances. 
Embedding in LASE can therefore reveal topological features of the 
fitness map that are obfuscated in an OHE embedding.
Sequences projected by tSNE from the LASE embedding space 
cluster according to their relative fitness and how they were sampled 
(e.g., extant, ancestral, alternate, or recombined; Fig. 5B). For ex-
ample, all point mutations from alternate reconstructions and re-
combinations group together in a single connected component in

the LASE space, irrespective of the genetic background (ancestors 
55_547 or 35_442) they were introduced into. Moreso, ancestral and 
extant sequences cluster into disconnected components despite 
their often high degree of site- wise sequence similarity. The LASE 
representation space is highly structured relative to the OHE space, 
where ancestral and extant sequences co- occur across distinct iden-
tity groups in the network graph. For example, 35_442 and 55_547 
cluster together into the “ancestral cluster” in the LASE embedding 
space, whereas are resolved as independent components in the OHE 
domain. As with tSNE projection from the OHE domain, the local 
structure of the LASE embedding space is preserved nearly perfect-
ly (trustworthiness  = 0.98), suggesting that clustering in the tSNE 
basis is not artifactual. This indicates that our sequence sampling 
strategy is highly structured and systematic over an evolutionarily 
informative representation space while appearing somewhat ran-
dom in the OHE space.
Last, we used a graph signal processing approach to quantify 
ruggedness in the cutinase PET fitness landscape. We define rug-
gedness as the nonlinearity between the fitness of a sequence and its 
neighbors in the network graph. We use the Dirichlet energy (DE) 
of the graph, which describes the nonlinearity of a signal over a 
graph, to measure this (37,  51, 52). To make the Dirichlet energy 
interpretable as a node- wise local quantity, we calculate it over each 
subgraph in the network defined by an edge- length of exactly 1, thus 
reducing its interpretation to the deviation from linearity a node 
demonstrates relative only to its immediate neighbors; the fitness 
signal over the network graph changes as a linear function (i.e., is 
smooth) over nodes of the graph that are characterized by low local 
DEs. The local Dirichlet energy is therefore a descriptor of how con-
founded by epistasis a sequence is. This analysis revealed that the 
fitness landscape is most rugged over the cutinase variants with the 
greatest PETase activity. The node with the single highest local 
Dirichlet energy is also the fitness peak (ancestor 55_547_E28Q/
S196A). This was true for both OHE and LASE network graphs (Fig. 
5C and fig. S9), indicating that the combinatorial mutations E28Q/
S196A in the 55_547 background would be unlikely to be intro-
duced through a stepwise mutagenesis approach due to the relative-
ly low activity of each single mutation in isolation. We performed

analyses on how sensitive the local energies within the OHE and 
LASE landscapes were to both the underlying graph connectivity 
(the k parameter in the k- nearest neighbor (kNN) graph) and the 
sparsity of the data. We find that node- wise energies are significant-
ly correlated (P value ≪ 0.0001) for all k and sparsity values tested 
(figs. 10 to 13), indicating that results on landscape ruggedness are 
robust to the underlying graph structure. Together, these analyses 
demonstrate that mASR can effectively guide protein engineering by 
finding evolutionary features that are not immediately apparent and 
can help navigate rugged regions of sequence space to find fit en-
zyme variants that are not rationally obvious.
DISCUSSION
In our investigation into the evolutionary sequence space of bacte-
rial cutinases with PETase activity, we used mASR (37) to enhance 
our exploration. This method allowed us to reconstruct and analyze 
ancestral cutinases across 20 diverse phylogenetic topologies, mov-
ing beyond the constraints of a single- tree perspective. Our experi-
mental characterizations of 20 extant and 48 ancestral cutinases 
unveiled a wide spectrum of activities against amorphous PET film 
(A260 nm = 0.00 to 0.59). Of particular interest were two ancestors, 
35_442 (A260 nm = 0.37 ± 0.06) and 55_547 (A260 nm = 0.59 ± 0.09), 
each representing the most recent common ancestor of LCC (13) 
and TfCut2 (5) on independent trees and exhibiting similar activity 
to the most active extant cutinases, LCC (A 260 nm   = A 260 nm  = 
0.34 ± 0.03) and BhrPETase (A260 nm = 0.49 ± 0.01). Notably, the use 
of mASR was crucial in uncovering the variability of ancestral re-
constructed sequences, as it revealed that equivalent nodes from 
independent phylogenetic topologies exhibited highly varied activ -
ity despite all topologies being equally valid representations of the 
underlying sequence alignment based on the AU test. While some

ancestors were inactive, others showed PETase activity comparable 
to characterized extant PETases. These observations highlight the 
utility of the mASR method in improving both the success and ro-
bustness of ASR applications in protein engineering. By embracing 
a wider array of evolutionary scenarios, mASR allowed for a more 
comprehensive and reliable identification of functional sequences 
relative to a single- tree approach. mASR may therefore become an 
important component of ASR-  and evolutionary- guided enzyme de-
sign strategies in the future.
Our sequence and structural analysis of active and inactive ances-
tral cutinases provided insights on the evolutionary emergence of 
PETase activity in the cutinase family. In particular, our findings sug-
gest that PETase activity in the TfCut2 and LCC PETase lineages has 
emerged through neutral mutations that are distal to the active site, 
rather than specific changes localized to the active site itself, as ob-
served in the evolution of I. sakaiensis PETase (38). Our detailed ex-
amination of ancestors 35_442 and 55_547, along with their closest 
inactive counterparts, highlighted unique gain- of- function mutations 
leading to PETase activity from these distinct phylogenetic back-
grounds. These findings imply the existence of multiple, distinct evo-
lutionary pathways for acquiring PETase functionality and indicate 
that PETase activity is readily accessible within the cutinase family.
Our structural analysis also revealed the formation of domain- 
swapped dimers between adjacent symmetry mates in the crystal 
structures of the ancestral variants 35_442 and 55_547. While pos-
sibly an artifact of the crystallization conditions, this observation 
suggests a certain degree of structural flexibility in the C terminus of 
these ancestors even in solution. Based on this observation, we in-
troduced a disulfide bond in the C terminus of ancestor 55_547 that 
coincided with the predicted Ca2+/Mg2+ binding site, a strategy ho-
mologous to similar successful modifications in TfCut2 and LCC 
that were observed to improve stability and activity (6,  47, 48). The 
introduction of the disulfide N206C/S253C resulted in a variant of 
55_547 with an approximately twofold improvement in whole- cell 
activity and 1.5- fold improvement in soluble expression relative to 
the background ancestor.
We deepened our exploration of the evolutionary sequence space 
of the cutinase family by addressing ambiguously reconstructed po-
sitions in the initial mASR. Ambiguous positions were identified 
based on a posterior probability threshold of ≥0.2 for the second 
most probable residue. Introducing these 69 alternate reconstruc-
tions as single mutations into 35_442 and 55_547, we observed that 
most mutations were either neutral or decreased PETase activity 
relative to the ancestral background. However, when we recom-
bined a random subset of the alternate reconstructions, we observed 
several recombinations in the background of both 35_442 (E28Q/
S196A) and 55_547 (E14D/E28Q/A36V) that displayed increased 
PETase activity, relative not only to the initial ancestors but also to 
an engineered variant of LCC with enhanced activity, LCC ICCG 6 . 
Notably, the most active recombinations exhibited activity improve-
ments that exceeded the additive effects predicted from their indi-
vidual mutations, highlighting positive epistatic interactions that 
contribute to their PETase activity.
To complement our experimental investigations, we modeled the 
sequence- fitness landscape of all 196 cutinase sequences character -
ized in our study using a graph signal processing approach that elu-
cidates the complex topology of the PETase fitness landscape. This 
methodology involved embedding cutinase sequences as nodes 
in a network graph, where each node was connected to its kNNs 
(Euclidean), thereby enabling a direct comparison between two em-
bedding schemes, OHE and LASE. While OHE provides a straight-
forward mutational distance metric between sequences, it often 
oversimplifies the nuanced relationship between sequence variation 
and function. In contrast, LASE, by training a family- specific deep 
learning model on our dataset of ancestral reconstructed sequences, 
captures the functional properties of proteins in an abstract manner, 
revealing nonlinear sequence- activity relationships that are ob-
scured in OHE representations.
Using LASE to map the sequence- fitness landscape, we high-
lighted iterative improvements in PETase activity throughout the 
different phases of our sequence exploration of the cutinase family. 
This embedding not only facilitated a deeper understanding of the 
functional implications of sequence variation but also allowed us to 
identify clusters of sequences with similar functional profiles, re-
gardless of their evolutionary background. Moreover, our analysis of 
the fitness landscape’s ruggedness via LASE provided insights into 
the role of epistasis in PETase activity. The local Dirichlet energy 
calculations revealed that sequences with the highest PETase activi-
ty were associated with the greatest ruggedness, suggesting that the 
most functionally optimized variants emerge from complex inter -
plays of multiple mutations rather than from linear accumulations 
of beneficial single mutations. This observation highlights the sig-
nificance of epistatic interactions in driving the evolutionary inno-
vation of PETase activity, illustrating that successful enzyme variants 
often lie in regions of the fitness landscape that are not readily ac-
cessed through single mutational steps but can be accessed using 
evolutionarily- guided approaches, such as mASR.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Ancestral sequence reconstruction
Protein sequences (1000) were collected from the National Center 
for Biotechnology Information nonredundant (nr) database with 
pblast using LCC (UniProt: G9BY57) as seed and an E- value cutoff  
of 1 × 10 −5. Sequence redundancy was removed to 90% sequence 
identity (ID) in CD- HIT (53). Signal peptides were deleted using 
SignalP4.0 (54). Alignment was performed using the GINSI proto-
col of MAFFT (55). Replicates (100) of independent model param-
eterization and tree search (default parameters) were performed 
using IQTREE2 (56) on the National Computational Infrastructure 
(NCI) Gadi supercomputer. The sequence evolution model was pa-
rameterized using ModelFinder (57), as implemented in IQTREE2. 
Branch supports were determined as the ultrafast bootstrap approxi-
mation (39) calculated to 1000 replicates, as implemented in IQTREE2. 
The AU test (42) was conducted to 10,000 replicates for all ML to-
pologies. Empirical Bayesian ASR was performed on 20 of the 100 
trees that failed rejection by the AU test in CodeML (40) using the 
ML replacement matrix (LG) (58) with rates modeled as a discrete 
gamma distribution parameterized with four rate categories.
Small- scale protein expression and purification
Plasmids were transformed by heat shock into chemically compe-
tent BL21(DE3) Escherichia coli cells and plated onto lysogeny broth 
(LB) agar supplemented with kanamycin (100 μg/ml) and incubated 
at 37°C overnight. A single colony was used to inoculate 1.5- ml au-
toinduction media supplemented with kanamycin (100 μg/ml) in a 
2.2 ml of 96- well deep well block and grown at 1050 rpm at 37°C for 
5 hours, followed by room temperature (RT; 25°C) for 16 hours.

Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 2000g for 15 min at RT 
and resuspended in lysis buffer [1× BugBuster Protein Extraction Re-
agent (Merck- Millipore), 20 mM tris, 300 mM NaCl, turbonuclease 
(1 U/ml; pH 8; Sigma- Adrich)]. The cell suspension was left to incubate 
at RT for 20 min with gentle shaking. The lysate was separated from 
the insoluble cell debris by centrifugation at 2250g for 1 hour at RT.
The clarified lysate was then diluted with 100 μl of equilibration 
buffer [20 mM tris and 300 mM NaCl (pH 8)] and purified by 
nickel- charged immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) 
using a 96- well HisPurTM Ni- NTA Spin Plate (Thermo Fisher Sci-
entific) equilibrated in equilibration buffer, washing the sample 
three times with 250 μl of wash buffer [20 mM tris, 300 mM NaCl, 
and 10 mM imidazole (pH 8)], and eluting with 250 μl of elution 
buffer [20 mM tris, 300 mM NaCl, and 150 mM imidazole (pH 8)]. 
All centrifugation steps following addition of wash or elution buffer 
were at 1000g for 1 min at RT. The eluate was stored at 4°C. Bradford 
assay was used to quantify the soluble expression levels post- 
purification (fig. S1).
UV absorbance assay for PET- degrading activity
For purified protein from 96- well expression and purification, 15 μl 
of the eluate from the 96- well Ni- NTA purification and 285 μl of 
reaction buffer [50 mM bicine (pH 9)] was added to a clear 96- well 
plate. For purified protein from large- scale expression and purifica-
tion, 300 μl of 100 nM enzyme in reaction buffer was added to a 
clear 96- well plate. A single disk of amorphous PET (Goodfellow, 
ES301445) with 4 mm in diameter and 0.25 mm in thickness was 
added to each well. The plate was incubated at 60°C for 16 hours. 
Following incubation, 100 μl of the reaction solution was trans-
ferred to a clear UV- transparent 96- well plate, and the absorbance 
was measured between 240 and 300 nm in 10- nm steps using the 
Epoch Microplate Spectrophotometer (BioTek) (fig. S2). For com-
parison of activity of all variants, the A260 nm was used. Assays were 
repeated in technical triplicate for each variant.
Assay data processing
To correct for possible systematic error between replicate data 
points, the mean A260 nm for each replicate was determined. Using 
the mean absorbance, a scaling coefficient was assigned to the repli-
cates with the lowest and highest mean values such that the mean of 
the scaled absorbance values equaled the mean of the replicate with 
the mid- range mean value. To ensure scaling improved consistency 
between replicates, correlograms of the data before (fig. S3) and af-
ter (fig. S4) scaling were produced to confirm that the monotonic 
(rank) correlation between replicates was preserved.
Cloning of TEV- PETase variants for crystallography studies
Primer pairs containing the DNA sequence for the tobacco etch virus 
(TEV) cleavage site (5’- GAAAACCTGTATTTTCAAAGC- 3′) were 
constructed, specific to each PETase variant. Polymerase chain reac-
tion was performed using these primers and PETase variant genes to 
create mutant fragments. These fragments were reassembled using 
Gibson Assembly (59) and checked through Sanger sequencing to 
ensure that the TEV cleavage site was correctly introduced.
Large scale protein expression and purification
The TEV- PETase ancestral variants plasmids were transformed us-
ing electroporation into electrocompetent E. cloni cells (Lucigen) 
and plated onto LB agar supplemented with kanamycin (100 μg/ml). 
The plates were incubated overnight at 37°C. A single colony was 
inoculated into a 10- ml solution of LB media with kanamycin (100 μg/
ml) and incubated overnight at 37°C and 180 rotations per minute 
(rpm). This liquid starter culture was then added to 1 liter of autoin-
duction media (60) [6 g of Na 2HPO4, 3 g of KH 2PO4, 20 g of tryp-
tone, 5 g of yeast extract, 5 g of NaCl, 10 ml of 60% (v/v) glycerol, 
5 ml of 10% (w/v) glucose, and 25 ml of 8% (w/v) lactose] with ka-
namycin (100 μg/ml) and incubated for 24 hours at room tempera-
ture and 180 rpm. The cells were separated from the media by 
centrifugation at 5000g for 15 min at 4°C and resuspended in lysis 
buffer (400 mM NaCl, 25 mM imidazole, turbonuclease (1 U/mL; 
Sigma- Aldrich), and 50 mM tris- HCl (pH 8.0)]. The resuspended 
cell solution was lysed using two rounds of sonication at 50% power 
and pulse time for 5  min, with 5  min on ice between sonication 
steps. Next, the sample was centrifuged at 32,000g for 60 min at 4°C, 
and the soluble cell solution was separated from the insoluble cell 
material and filtered through a 0.45- μm pore size filter. The filtered 
soluble cell solution was passed through an equilibrated nickel- 
charged IMAC using a 5- ml HisTrap HP (GE Healthcare Life Sci-
ences) in lysis buffer. The protein bound to the column was eluted 
using elution buffer [400 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, and 50 mM 
tris- HCl (pH 8.0)]. The protein sample was buffer exchanged to 
TEV reaction buffer [100 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM dithio-
threitol, 1% (v/v) glycerol, and 50 mM tris- HCl (pH 8.0)] using a 
PD- 10 desalting column and diluted to 50 ml in this buffer. A 1 ml 
of solution containing purified TEV protease (1 mg/ml) was added 
and incubated at room temperature overnight. The cleaved sample 
was passed through an equilibrated Nickel- charged IMAC using a 
5- ml HisTrap HP (GE Healthcare Life Sciences), and the flowthrough 
was collected. This flowthrough was concentrated using the 3- kDa 
Amicon ultra 15- ml centrifugal filters and filtered through a 0.22- μm 
filter. Last, the cleaved protein was purified to homogeneity using 
size exclusion chromatography, and the HiLoad 26/600 Superdex 
200 column (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) was equilibrated in size 
exclusion buffer [150 mM NaCl and 25 mM Hepes (pH 7.5)].
Protein crystallization and structure determination
Proteins were concentrated using the 3- kDa Amicon ultra 15- ml 
centrifugal filters to 15 to 36 mg/ml and crystallized in 20% (w/v) 
polyethylene glycol (PEG) 3350 alongside 0.2 M salt and bis- tris 
buffer solution, specifically ancestor 55_547 in 0.2 M sodium/potas-
sium tartrate, 0.1 M bis- tris propane (pH 7.5), and 20% (w/v) PEG 
3350 and ancestor 35_442 in 0.2 M sodium malonate, 0.1 M bis- tris 
propane (pH 6.5), and 20% (w/v) PEG 3350. The x- ray diffraction 
data were collected on the MX2 beamline at the Australian Synchro-
tron (61). The data were processed using XDS (62), and the phase 
problem was resolved with molecular replacement using the PETase 
wild- type structure (PDB: 6EQE) as the search model. The ligands 
and solvent molecules were removed and then used as the search 
model part of Phaser (CCP4) (63). The structure was refined using 
phenix.refine (64) through multiple iterative steps and rebuilt each 
time with Coot (65). The structures of ancestors 55_547 and 35_442 
were deposited in the PDB under the PDB IDs 8ETX and 8ETY , re-
spectively.
Protein sequence representations
To analyze PETase sequence space, OHE and LASE were made. 
To produce OHE, aligned PETase sequences were converted into a 
(20by267) matrix, where gaps were represented as a zero vector of

length 20. The LASE embedding model was implemented as a Trans-
former in PyTorch 2.0.1 as previously described (37), with three en-
coder blocks with two- headed multihead attention (64 dimensions) 
and a feed- forward fully connected layer (128 dimensions). The 
LASE embedding model was trained with a masking percent of 15%, 
more than 100 epochs with a batch size of 32 using the Adam opti-
mizer. Loss was determined as the categorical cross entropy loss. 
Performance over training was assessed with perplexity and cate-
gorical accuracy (fig. S8).
Local Dirichlet energy calculations
To estimate the local ruggedness of each PETase variant, the kNNs 
of each node were used to produce a kNN subgraph for each variant 
with scikit- learn 1.2.1. The kNN subgraphs were made symmetric 
by considering (bi)directional edges as undirectional. The dirichlet 
energy was calculated as previously described (52, 66)
where, λm is the normalized dirichlet energy, N is the number of 
variants in the subgraph, y is the activity (absorbance) of each vari-
ant, L is the graph Laplacian operator of the adjacency matrix of 
each kNN subgraph, and T denotes a transpose operation.
