Enzyme function is often regulated by weak metal-ion binding, which results from conformational changes while 
maintaining conformational fluctuations. We analyzed the structure and function of cutinase-like enzyme, Cut190, 
using biophysical methods such as X-ray crystallography and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, showing that 
its structure and function are finely regulated by weak Ca 2+ binding and release. We succeeded to stabilize the 
enzyme by introducing a disulfide -bond which can degrade polyethylene terephthalate (PET) to PET monomers 
at the glass transition temperature of PET, ≈ 70°C. In this study, using the stabilized Cut190 mutants, Cut190**SS 
and Cut190**SS_F77L, we evaluated the requirement of Ca 2+ for catalytic activity at 70°C, showing that the 
enzyme expressed the activity even in the absence of Ca2+, in contrast to that at 37°C. These results were supported 
by multicanonical MD analysis, which showed that the respective forms of the enzyme , such as closed, open, and 
engaged forms, were exchangeable, possibly because the potential energy barriers  between the respective forms 
were lowered. Taken together, the conformational equilibrium to express the catalytic activity was regulated by 
weak Ca 2+ binding at 37°C, and was also regulated by increasing temperature. The respective conformational 
states of Cut190**SS and Cut190**SS_F77L correlated well with their different catalytic activities for PET.

Introduction 
 
Cutinases belong to the lipase superfamily and catalyze the hydrolysis of complex plant biopolymers in the cuticle layer 
of leaves (cutin) and in the suberin layer of roots (suberin) [1]. A putative cutinase gene (cut190) was cloned from the 
thermophilic Saccharomonospora viridis AHK190, and its protein, Cut190, was expressed in Escherichia coli [2]. The 
catalytic triad of Cut190, Ser176- Asp222-His254, forms an active site  (Fig. 1, note that Ser176 was substituted to Ala ). 
A unique feature of Cut190 is that its function is regulated via Ca2+ binding. Our crystal structure analyses using Cut190 
mutants showed that the closed form underwent an accelerated conformational change to the open form upon Ca2+ binding 
for substrate binding, followed by a change to the engaged form with Ca 2+ release for substrate hydrolysis [3- 6]. In the 
open form, Phe77 is oriented outwards, and Phe81 is oriented inward, contributing to the hydrophobic core  (Fig. 1). In 
the closed and engaged forms, Phe81 is oriented outwards, and Phe77 is oriented inward, contributing to the hydrophobic 
core. In the engaged form, Thr107 at the active site moves to form hydrogen bonds with the substrate. These crystal 
structures indicated that Ca2+ binding changed the Cut190 conformation or population, which was closely correlated with 
its catalytic function. Ca2+ plays an important role in maintaining the balance between the open and engaged/closed forms 
of Cut190. As observed with the native mass spectrometry results [4], our crystal structures also i ndicated that the three 
Ca2+ ions were bound at Sites 1- 3 of Cut190 (Fig. 1). Mutational analyses of the functional roles of three Ca 2+ binding 
sites indicated that Sites 1 and 2 were related to activation and thermostabilization, respectively, and Site 3 was 
supplementally related to both activation and thermostabilization [7]. It should also be noted that Ca
2+ binding is weaker 
than that of other metal -ions such as Zn 2+ and Mn2+ [8]. Zn2+ binding was observed in isothermal titration calorimetry 
(ITC) experiments, and the binding stoichiometry 3 was in good agreement with the three binding sites. In contrast, Ca2+ 
binding was below the ITC detection limit [8]. The weak binder, Ca 2+, would be essential for the conformational change 
of Cut190, which is required for catalytic activity [9].

Thermostable cutinases can be used to chemically recycle polyethylene terephthalate (PET) [10 -12]. The 
depolymerization of PET by an enzyme is one of the most efficient methods, because of its low energy consumption 
compared with conventional processes using supercritical fluids. In order to depolymerize PET, a thermally stable enzyme 
is required, because depolymerization of the inner block of PET occurs above the glass transition temperature ( Tg), ≈ 
70°C. We generated Cut190 mutants to increase stability using S226P/R228S mutant (Cut190*) as a template, and showed 
that the introduction of a disulfide-bond at Site 2 upon D250C and E296C mutations could significantly increase thermal 
stability while maintaining its activity [7]. In combination with other mutations to increase both stability and activity [5,7], 
we succeeded in generating the mutant, Q123H/Q138A/N202H/S226P/R228S/D250C -
E296C/K305del/L306del/N307del, designated Cut190**SS, which could depolymeri ze PET with high efficiency. 
Furthermore, we found that F77L mutation in Cut190**SS increased its catalytic activity [13].  
We evaluated the catalytic activity of Cut190 mutants with high thermal stability at high temperatures. With increasing 
temperature, the structural dynamics of Cut190 mutants may change, possibly changing the Ca 2+-dependent activity. 
Understanding the mechanism will apply for PET depolymerization and recycling.  Using the stabilized Cut190 mutants, 
Cut190**SS and Cut190**SS_F77L, we could analyze the catalytic activit ies at 70°C  and the correlation with their

conformational states and structural dynamics. In this study, we first analyzed the metal-ion binding of Cut190**SS and 
Cut190**SS_F77L using ITC. These results support the notion that the metal -ion binding affinity decreased upon the 
introduction of a disulfide -bond, as observed in Cut190*SS reported previously [6]. However, the catalytic activity of 
poly(butylene succinate-co-adipate) (PBSA) at 37°C indicated that Ca 2+ binding is required for activity. In contrast, we 
found that Cut190**SS and Cut190**SS_F77L expressed catalytic activities towards both PBSA and PET at 70°C even 
in the absence of Ca2+. This could be explained by the change in the conformational states of the enzyme with increasing 
temperature, as analyzed using multicanonical molecular dynamics simulations (McMD), which is a generalized 
ensemble method [14]. With McMD, the bias is corr elated with the temperature, enabling McMD simulations to 
adaptively modulate the bias, given the density of states. Thus, the potential energy surface functio ns as a reaction 
coordinate that does not depend on prior knowledge (e.g., any specific conformation). A canonical ensemble at any given 
temperature, which is a physico-chemically acceptable ensemble, can be generated from a multicanonical ensemble using 
a reweighting procedure. The free energy landscape (FEL), which governs the thermodynamic properties of a system, can 
be obtained by mapping the reweighted structural ensemble onto a reaction coordinate, such as a binding path, or onto 
one or more principal components obtained through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [15,16]. Analysis of the FEL 
uncovers stable conformations, as sampled by McMD simulations. Furthermore, analysis of stable structures can provide 
insight into the conformational preferences of complex molecules [13,17- 19]. Thus, these results indicated that catalytic 
activity is closely correlated with the population of the conformational states that are regulated by Ca 2+ to overcome the 
potential energy barrier s. With increasing temperature, the energy barrier s decreased, enabling the exchange of the 
respective states without Ca2+ binding. 
 
Materials and methods 
 
Proteins 
The gene for Cut190**SS was constructed from Cut190*SS. Three residues at C -terminus of Cut190*SS, Lys305-
Leu306-Asn307, were removed by introducing a stop codon. The gene for Cut190**SS_F77L was constructed from 
Cut190**SS by site -directed mutagenesis [13 ]. The proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli  and purified as 
reported previously [4]. The protein concentration was spectrophotometrically determined using a molar absorption 
coefficient of 4.02 × 104 M−1 cm−1 at 280 nm. 
 
Small-angle X-ray scattering with size-exclusion chromatography (SEC-SAXS) measurements 
The SEC-SAXS experiments were performed  in two different days (noted as exp. 1 and 2) at BL38B1 of SPring- 8 at 
20°C, as described previously [20] . The enzyme solution (8.0 mg mL –1), 200 µL, was injected into a Superdex 200 
increase 10/300 column (Cytiva) operated by an HPLC system (Shimadzu, Kyoto, Japan) with an elution buffer, 20 mM 
Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl  containing 3% glycerol at a flow rate of 0.3  mL min–1 (exp. 1) or 0.45 mL min–1 (exp. 
2). For only Cut190**SS bound to Ca2+ (exp. 1), 2.5 mM CaCl2 was included in the elution buffer. The 2D images were 
processed to obtain 1D scattering profiles with the SAngler ( v2.1.65 (exp. 1) and v2.1.68 (exp. 2)) program [21].  The 
SEC-SAXS data were analyzed with the MOLASS (v1.0.13) program [22]. The range of the magnitude of the scattering 
vector q used for the SAXS analysis was 0.007 < q (=4πsinθ/λ) < 0.43 Å−1, where θ is a half of the scattering angle and λ 
is the wavelength of X -rays (1.00 Å). The sample-to-detector distance was 2569 nm (exp. 1) or 2390 mm (exp. 2). The 
scattering curves were calculated with GNOM (v5.0) [23] programs in the ATSAS (v3.2.1) suite [24]. 
 
ITC measurements 
ITC experiments were carried out at 25°C using iTC200 (Malvern). All samples were in 10 mM Tris -HCl (pH 8.0). A 
solution of metal-ion (1 mM) was titrated into the enzyme solution (0.03 mM). Each titration consisted of a preliminary 
0.5-μL injection followed by subsequent 2 -μL additions, which were performed over 5 sec periods at 120 sec intervals. 
Data were analyzed with the Origin software supplied by MicroCal. 
 
Enzymatic activity measurements 
The enzymatic activit ies for PBSA were measured by monitoring the decrease in the turbidity of PBSA suspension 
(BionolleTM EM-301; molecular weight average 1.0 × 10 5) at 600 nm, as described previously [2]. The reaction mixture 
including PBSA (8.75 µM, OD600 = 3.5) and the enzyme (1.33 μM) was incubated at 37°C or 70°C for 30 min with gentle 
shaking in a water bath. Kinetic values were calculated from Michaelis-Menten plots for degradation of PBSA (3.75 μM 
to 23.75 μM). The measurements were performed in triplicate. 
The enzymatic activities for PET were measured by monitoring the products by reverse-phased HPLC. Amorphous PET 
(PET-GF, GoodFellow) was homogenized to small particles with a diameter between 30-50 μm. These PET particles, 20 
mg, were suspended in a 0.4 mL solution containing 50 mM Tris -HCl (pH 8.7), 2.5 mM CaCl2, and were hydrolyzed by 
the enzyme, with a final concentration of 0.04 mg/mL, at 70°C  for 2 or 24 h.  To prevent precipitation of PET particles, 
e220009_3
the reaction was carried out with shaking.  The hydrolyzed PET monomers, terephthalic acid (TPA), MHET, and bis(2-
hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), were analyzed using a reverse -phased HPLC column, YMC -Pack ODS-AM. The 
products were eluted using a solvent of 19% acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifl uoroacetic acid isocratically, and were 
monitored by measuring absorbance at 240 nm. 
 
McMD simulations 
McMD simulations were conducted to explore the conformational space of cutinase in the presence of bound PET trimer 
under three different conditions, Ca2+-free Cut190**SS, Ca2+-bound Cut190**SS, and Ca2+-free Cut190**SS_F77L [13]. 
A multicanonical ensemble was obtained for each system, spanning a temperature range from 280 K to 700 K. To facilitate 
enhanced local conformational sampling while preventing unfolding, weak distance restraints were applied to the cutinase 
molecule. These restraints targeted the backbone oxygen and nitrogen atoms for helical and β -sheet secondary structure 
elements. In addition, distance restraints between selected Cα atoms were added (Glu47- Arg278, Arg48-Glu91, Glu58-
Lys263). A repulsive restraint was also introduced for the CBH-CAQ atoms of the PET -trimer to prevent the curling of 
the PET residues. T he conformations were analyzed in a similar manner as our McMD -based dynamic docking 
simulations [18]. PCA was performed on the loops of β1 -β2 (77-81), β4-α3 (105-112), and β3- α2 (131-137) and their 
surrounding regions using a merged trajectory from the three datasets. For each residue, two atoms were selected; the Cα 
atom and one representative atom from the sidechain, except for glycine, where only the Cα a tom was selected). Atom-
pairs were formed between all selected atoms from the loop-selection i versus all selected atoms from the whole enzyme 
j. Then, atom pairs corresponding to sequential residues (i ± 3 residues) were removed, as were atom pairs whose distance 
was more than 8 Å in the reference structure (PDB ID : 8Z2I) for atoms j that were not also part of the loop regions. In 
total, 746 atom pairs were used for the PCA.  The structures are then projected onto the first two principal components, 
and the probability of each bin k  on the landscape is calculated as 𝑃𝑃𝑘𝑘 = ∑ 𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐(𝐸𝐸𝑙𝑙)𝑙𝑙  using each structure l  within bin k , 
where 𝑃𝑃𝑐𝑐 is the canonical distribution at any given temperature T and 𝐸𝐸𝑙𝑙 is the potential energy of structure l. The free 
energy as the Potential of Mean Force (PMF)  was calculated as 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑘𝑘 = −𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 𝑃𝑃𝑘𝑘 for each bin, yielding the 2D free 
energy landscape (FEL) with the minimum normalized to zero.  Here, R is the gas constant and T  (= 300 K or 340 K)  is 
the reweighted temperature. 
 
Results 
 
Both Cut190**SS and Cut190**SS_F77L were purified well in their monomeric states (Figs. 2A and S1A). In order to 
evaluate the conformational states of these enzymes and the effects of Ca
2+ binding in solution, SEC-SAXS analysis was 
carried out (Fig s. 2 and S1 ). Kratky plots showed no  significant change s in the structure s of these enzymes and 
Cut190**SS due to Ca2+ binding. The radii of gyration (Rg) determined from the Gunier plots are summarized in  Table 
1. These results suggest that  the conformational differences in these enzymes and Cut190**SS  upon Ca2+ binding were 
below the detection limit of SAXS.

Metal-ion binding to Cut190**SS and Cut190**SS_F77L was analyzed using ITC, which showed little heat (Fig. 3 ). 
This is similar to Zn
2+ binding to Cut190*SS and Cut190*SS_S176A [6], but not to Cut190*S176A [8].  T hus, the 
introduction of a disulfide-bond in Cut190 reduce d the metal-ion binding affinity below  the detection limit of ITC . The 
introduction of a disulfide-bond at Site 2 also affected the metal-ion binding to Sites 1 and 3. Ca2+ binding to Cut190**SS 
and Cut190**SS_F77L was too low to be detected by ITC (Fig. 3), similar to the previous results for Cut190 mutants

with and without the disulfide -bond [6,8]. The catalytic activities  
of Cut190**SS and Cut190**SS_F77L at 37°C was activated in 
the presence of Ca 2+ (Fig. 4), similar to Cut190*SS  [6]. These 
results indicate that Ca 2+ specifically binds to the enzyme with a 
low binding affinity below the ITC detection limit.  In comparison 
with Cut190**, both Km and kcat values of Cut190**SS decreased, 
resulting in kcat/Km that almost unchanged upon the introduction of 
a disulfide-bond (Table 2). Further mutation of F77L resulted in an 
increase in the values of both kcat and Km (Table 2). Th e catalytic 
activity towards PBSA at 70°C was also analyzed. In the presence 
of Ca2+, the activity at 70°C was higher than that at 37°C. Using 
the stabilized mutants, Cut190**SS and Cut190**SS_F77L,

it was possible to analyze PET degradation at the glass transition  temperature. Notably,  even in the absence of Ca 2+, 
activity at 70°C for both PBSA and PET was observed (Fig. 4). For PBSA degradation at 70°C, the activity in the absence 
of Ca2+ was 36% and 56% for Cut190**SS  and Cut190**SS_F77L, respectively, and increased up to approximately 
100% in the presence of Ca2+. In contrast, for PBSA degradation at 37°C, the activity in the absence or presence of 0.25

of Ca2+ was similar to that in the presence of Ca2+ under the reaction conditions used in this study. The catalytic activity 
of Cut190**SS_F77L at 70°C for both PBSA and PET was higher than that of Cut190**SS (Fig. 4), as observed for those 
at 37°C for PBSA reported previously [13]. 
The structural ensembles of Cut190**SS  and Cut190**SS_F77L at 340 K were analyzed using McMD simulations . 
Figure 5 shows the first two principal components (PC1 and PC2, respectively) obtained via PCA to produce the FEL. A 
set of representative structures was obtained from the structural ensemble, and mapped onto the FEL. In the 2D landscape 
at 300 K, several islands were observed, which c ould be classified into open , closed, and engaged  conformations, as 
determined by the crystal structures  (Figs. 5D and 6). Notably, at 340 K,  the FEL became more ragged , the respective 
islands partly merged in either the Ca 2+-bound state or the Ca 2+-unbound state , and the r epresentative structures  also 
merged (Figs. 5A-5C), indicating that the respective conformations were exchangeable. Therefore, catalytic activity was 
expressed even in the absence of Ca 2+.  The population of the open conformation in the Ca 2+-bound state was relatively 
larger than that in the Ca 2+-unbound state (Figs. 5 A and 5B), which was in good agreement with the crystal structure  
information showing that the Ca 2+-bound and Ca2+-unbound structures of Cut190*SS are open and closed, respectively 
[6]. Our previous studies showed that Ca2+ releasing is needed for the conformational change from open to engaged forms 
[4,13]. The population of the conformational states of Cut190*SS would be change d from Fig. 5B to Fig. 5A by Ca 2+ 
releasing. The respective islands of Cut190**SS_F77L were expanded more and merged than those of Cut190**SS (Figs. 
5A and 5C), possibly correlating with differences in catalytic activity (Fig. 4). 
 
Discussion 
 
An enzyme expresses its catalytic activity by changing its structure or structural dynamics, some of which are regulated 
by metal-ion binding. Because the respective structures are located as potential energy minima in a folding funnel [25] , 
the energy barriers between them must be overcome to change the structure from one to another [26]. Our crystal structure 
analyses of Cut190 mutants indicated that Ca2+ binding to Site 1 changed the structure from closed to open for substrate 
binding, followed by a conformational change to the engaged and ejecting forms (Fig. 6), along with substrate hydrolysis 
and product release [3-6,13]. Because proteins would crystallize from the most stable and populated structures, the major 
structure tends to be the crystal structure. Not only the major form of Cut190, but also the minor forms coexist in solution, 
and the population changes  upon Ca2+ binding. Ca2+ binding can change the Cut190 structure to overcome the potential 
energy barrier s between its respective forms . With increasing temperature, possibly because of  the increased thermal 
fluctuation of the enzyme, the respective forms are exchangeable even in the absence of Ca2+, resulting in the expression 
of catalytic activity. This was supported by McMD simulations, showing that the respective islands of the FEL observed 
at 300 K merged at 340 K (Fig. 5). At 300 K, the respective structures could be classified into open, closed, and engaged 
forms (Fig. 6). In contrast, at 340 K, closed and engaged forms were partially merged. The results also support the notion 
that the respective conformations were exchangeable, resulting in the catalytic activity even in the absence of Ca 2+ (Fig. 
4).

We previously analyzed the binding thermodynamics of metal-ions to the inactive mutant of Cut190*, Cut190*S176A, 
using ITC [8]. The binding affinities and stoichiometries of Zn 2+, Mn2+, and Mg 2+ were also determined. As little heat 
was observed in the ITC for Ca2+ binding, the binding affinity of Ca 2+ was lower than that of the other three metal-ions. 
Upon introduction of a disulfide-bond between residues 250 and 296, little heat was observed, even during Zn2+ binding 
(Fig. 3), as observed with respect  to Cut190*SS [6]. While three Zn2+ molecules bound to Sites 1, 2, and 3 of 
Cut190*S176A with detectable ITC heat [8], all binding affinities decreased upon the introduction  of a disulfide-bond. 
This further indicates that the introduction of a disulfide-bond at Site 2 could change the metal-ion binding properties not 
only at Site 2 but also at Sites 1 and 3. The Ca2+ binding affinities of Cut190 mutants with the disulfide-bonds would also 
decrease, based on the catalytic activities of Cut190* and Cut190**SS at 37°C, as described below. The catalytic activity 
of Cu190**SS in the presence of 0.25 mM Ca 2+ was approximately 10% , which was slightly higher than the control 
without the enzyme (Fig. 4). In contrast, the catalytic activity of Cu t190* in the presence of 0.25 mM Ca 2+ was 
approximately 80% of that of 2.5 mM Ca2+ [7]. Taken together, the low activity of the disulfide-bond introduced mutants 
in the presence of 0.25 mM Ca 2+ could be explained by the decreased Ca 2+ binding affinity. As discussed previously  
[8,27], the weak binder Ca2+ would maintain enzyme fluctuations, and thus regulates enzyme function well. In contrast, 
the catalytic activity at 70°C in the presence of 0.25 mM Ca2+ was similar to those at higher Ca2+ concentrations (Fig. 4). 
Even in the absence of Ca2+, the catalytic activity of PET at 70°C was similar to that in the presence of Ca2+. These results 
are in good agreement with the McMD results, showing that the population of the closed form increased at 340 K. 
Furthermore, the potential energy barrier s between the respective forms of enzyme would be lowered at 70 °C where the 
enzyme can change the form even in the absence of Ca 2+. For PET degradation, it would be beneficial to use an enzyme 
without Ca2+. 
The increased stability and activity of Cut190**SS makes it a  promising candidate for PET degradation. As shown in 
the chemical recycling of PET by engineered leaf -branch compost cutinase [10,11], the depolymerization of PET by 
enzymes around Tg is best for degrading the inner block of PET. Using Cut190**SS as a template, we are currently 
attempting to improve its  catalytic activity for PET. Information on the structural dynamics obtained from McMD 
simulations will also contribute to the design of mutants with increased activity. The F77L mutation actually increased 
PET degradation [13]. We found that the F77L mutation increased the population of the closed and engaged forms at 300 
K, which correlated well with the increased kcat value of Cut190**SS_F77L (Table 2). Difference in structural dynamics 
between Cut190**SS and Cut190**SS_F77L in the absence or presence of Ca2+ was smaller than the detection limit of 
the present SEC-SAXS analysis (Fig. 2  and Table 1).  McMD simulations for the population of  the respective forms in 
solution showed that Ca2+ binding increased in the open form at 340 K (Fig. 5B), as well as at 300 K [13]. With increasing 
temperature, the boundaries of the respective FEL islands disappeared, indicating that  the exchange between the 
respective forms became faster (Fig. 5). These results explain the catalytic activity of Cut190 regulated by Ca2+ binding 
and Ca2+ dependency decreas ing with increasing temperature. These combined methods are usef ul not only for basic 
protein science to elucidate the structure- activity relationships, but also for the application of PET degradation and its 
chemical recycling. 
 
Conclusions 
 
The stabilized Cut190 mutants can degrade PET even in the absence of Ca 2+ at 70°C. Multicanonical MD simulations 
showed that t he conformational change of enzyme required for catalytic activity was induced upon Ca 2+ binding and 
release at 37 °C while that occurred even in the absence of Ca 2+ with increasing temperature. The respective 
conformational states of Cut190 mutants correlated well with their catalytic activities.
