Polyethylene terephthalate hydrolases (PETases) are a newly discovered and industrially important 
class of enzymes that catalyze the enzymatic degradation of polyethylene terephatalate (PET), one 
of the most abundant plastics in the world. The greater enzymatic efficiencies of PETases compared 
to close relatives from the cutinase and lipase families have resulted in increasing research interest. 
Despite this, further characterization of PETases is essential, particularly regarding their possible 
activity against other kinds of plastic. In this study, we exploited for the first time the use of the 
microalgal chloroplast for more sustainable synthesis of a PETase enzyme. A photosynthetic‑
restoration strategy was used to generate a marker‑free transformant line of the green microalga 
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii in which the PETase from Ideonella sakaiensis was constitutively 
expressed in the chloroplast. Subsequently, the activity of the PETase against both PET and post‑
consumer plastics was investigated via atomic force microscopy, revealing evidence of degradation of 
the plastics.
Natural polymers such as lignin, starch, chitin, and cellulose are water-insoluble macromolecules present in 
the environment, and although such polymers are generally recalcitrant to physical and chemical degradation, 
nature has evolved enzymes for their  breakdown1. Plastics are instead synthetic polymers designed specifically 
for their high resistance to degradation. Plastics are central to modern life and their production has expanded 
tremendously during the last few decades owing to their versatile properties and low cost. Although an increas-
ing number of microorganisms capable of degrading plastic polymers have been isolated and the enzymes 
involved metabolically characterized, additional studies are needed to identify novel enzymes and associated 
degradation pathways for the wide range of different  plastics1–5. The challenge of understanding and optimiz-
ing plastic enzymatic degradation closely emulates that of enzymatic depolymerization of  polysaccharides6–8. 
Indeed, strategies that have been used to understand and improve glycoside hydrolases, including the develop-
ment of quantitative assays for measuring enzyme (or enzyme cocktail) performance, can serve as inspiration 
for more quantitative metrics for comparing plastic-degrading enzymes and enzyme  mixtures9,10. Owing to its 
robust mechanical properties and high post-consumer recycling costs, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is one 
of the most abundant plastics in the world. PET accumulates in our environment without significant microbial 
 conversion2–5. The constant flux of new PET into the global market has produced enormous amounts of waste 
with a long biodegradation timescale. This waste contributes to global pollution, especially for marine ecosystems, 
and poses a threat to human and animal  health11–14.
In 2016, Y oshida et al. discovered and isolated two new enzymes from Ideonella sakaiensis, a bacterium which 
was able to grow using PET as the main carbon and energy  source15. These enzymes are a polyethylene tereph-
thalate hydrolase (PETase), which can convert PET into mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET) and 
mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate hydrolase, responsible for the conversion of MHET to terephthalic acid

(TPA) and ethylene glycol (EG)15–18. Since then, numerous PET hydrolases, belonging to the esterase class (EC 
3.1.1., carboxylic ester hydrolases) have been reported and  characterized19–25. Given that plastic waste is mainly 
disposed of via incineration or thermal degradation, the possibility of biological degradation of such waste to 
non-toxic monomers still represents an attractive and greener solution to reduce pollution.
For production of enzymes for research and industrial purposes, the exploitation of the native plastic-degrad-
ing microorganism is not always possible and organisms that are easier to culture and engineer for heterologous 
expression are  required26. To this end, microalgae represent an attractive biotechnology platform for the syn-
thesis of recombinant  proteins27–29. The advantages of using microalgae as opposed to traditional heterotrophic 
platforms of Escherichia coli , yeast, or CHO cells are: (i) the low-cost phototrophic cultivation of the alga in 
sterile, controlled photobioreactors using simple and inexpensive  medium30 and in this particular case without 
using any kind of antibiotics for the selection of the strain; (ii) the generally recognized as safe (GRAS) status 
of a number of algal species, including the chlorophyte Chlamydomonas reinhardtii31; (iii) the availability of the 
chloroplast as a unique biosynthetic and storage compartment within the cell that contains its own minimal 
genetic  system32–34; and (iv) a growing interest and adoption of enabling synthetic biology principles for creat -
ing bespoke cell factories using  microalgae 35. Whilst several recent studies have reported the production of 
PETase in microalgal species through nuclear  engineering36,37, the use of the chloroplast for expression of foreign 
genes confers several benefits. These including precise insertion into the chloroplast genome (= “plastome”) via 
homologous recombination, high-level expression that is not subject to any gene-silencing mechanisms, the 
possibility of expressing multiple transgenes as operons and the accumulation of the recombinant proteins in a 
benign compartment where the formation of di-sulfide bonds occurs  readily38. Here we report the synthesis of 
PETase from I. sakaiensis in the chloroplast of C. reinhardtii and demonstrate that the purified enzyme is active 
against both PET and post-consumer plastic (PCP).
Results
Generation of transplastomic C. reinhardtii expressing PETase. A synthetic gene encoding the 
mature form of the I. sakaiensis PETase was codon optimized for expression in the chloroplast and cloned into the 
pSRSapI destination vector, to generate plasmid pSRSapI:PETase (Supplementary Fig. S1). The bacterial PETase 
enzyme contains two disulphide bonds that are formed following secretion into the I. sakaiensis  periplasm39. We 
therefore decided to retain the sequence for the N-terminal Sec-type signal peptide within the transgene design 
so that the enzyme would be similarly targeted into the thylakoid lumen. Previous work has shown that bacterial 
signal peptides can direct recombinant proteins into the thylakoid lumen, and that disulphide bond formation 
occurs more readily in this chloroplast  compartment40. This was used to transform C. reinhardtii strain TN72 
with the PETase gene integrated into the plastome at a neutral locus between psbH and trnE2. Integration of 
the transforming DNA into TN72 also restores a wild-type copy of psbH, which is an essential photosynthesis 
 gene41. Selection is therefore based on restoration of photosynthesis allowing the generation of transformants 
lacking any antibiotic-based selectable marker, with the only foreign DNA introduced into the plastome being 
the PETase coding sequence (Fig. 1A).
As the C. reinhardtii plastome is polyploid with ~ 40 copies per cell under phototrophic  conditions43, transfor-
mant lines were restreaked several times to single colonies under selective conditions to drive the lines to homo-
plasmy where all plastome copies have the transgenic DNA. Two such lines (TN72:PETase.1 and TN72:PETase.2, 
hereafter) were checked for homoplasmy using a 3-primer PCR screen (Fig.  1A). This showed a single band 
at 1037 bp in the TN72:PETase.1 and TN72:PETase.2 PCRs and a single band at 878 bp in the parental TN72 
control PCRs, confirming correct integration of the PETase cassette and homoplasmy (Fig.  1B). Furthermore, 
it was found that selection based on restoration of phototrophy established homoplasmy much more readily 
than antibiotic-based selection. This is probably due to the strong selective pressure of restoring the photosyn -
thetic phenotype and to the reduced copy number of cells grown on minimal medium rather than the acetate-
containing medium normally used for antibiotic-based  selection41. Finally, PCR amplification and sequencing 
of the PETase cassette from both transformant lines confirmed than neither had acquired any mutations during 
plastome integration.
PETase is expressed in the chloroplast. The TN72:PETase.1 cell line was characterized further in order 
to assess the level of recombinant protein produced and to determine whether the protein is correctly folded 
and functional. An evaluation of the PETase level was conducted by SDS-PAGE analysis of cell extracts with 
proteins bands in the 27 kDa region cut from the gel, trypsin-digested and subjected to tandem mass (MS/MS) 
spectrometry. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S2 protein sequence coverage for PETase of 27% derived from 
the cut band of the gel in Supplementary Fig. S2 confirmed unambiguously the presence of PETase in the strains. 
Other bands from constitutive proteins were analysed revealing the presence of malate dehydrogenase of 30 kDa 
(Supplementary Fig. S3) and cytochrome c at 10 kDa (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Purification of recombinant PETase from transgenic C. reinhardtii. PETase has the classic α/β 
hydrolases fold, but despite the sequence similarity to cutinases and lipases, the highly polarized surface charge 
of PETase creates a dipole that gives the enzyme an isoelectric point of 9.6 17 that allows a first step of purifica-
tion by cationic exchange. The protein was successfully recovered using an optimized two-step chromatography 
approach as described in the methods and shown in Fig. 2A,B. Elution of PETase from the first column occurred 
at a concentration between 0.1 and 0.15 M of NaCl. Several other peaks were observed on the chromatogram 
during this phase indicating the presence of several endogenous protein contaminants. Fractions highlighted in 
red in Fig.  2A were loaded on the size exclusion chromatography (SEC) column, and a group of low-concen-
tration proteins eluted first (peak 6 in Fig.  2B); followed by the majority of the proteins as three separate peaks

labelled 8–10 (due to the presence of two small shoulders), 11 and 12 (Fig.  2B). All fractions were analyzed by 
SDS-PAGE (Fig. 2C). The gel shows that fraction 8–10 contained a major protein with a molecular weight greater 
than 35  kDa, that was analysed by MS/MS revealing the presence of malate dehydrogenase (Supplementary 
Fig. S3). Sample 12 revealed a band with a molecular weight of approximately 27 kDa, consistent with that of 
mature PETase. The band was analysed via MS/MS spectrometry confirming its identity as PETase with a 51% 
sequence coverage (Fig.  2D). Sample 12 also contained a mitochondrial cytochrome c that was identified by 
MS/MS spectrometry and UV–visible spectroscopy (Supplementary Fig. S4 and Fig. 2E). Since this cytochrome 
has a pI = 9.39, it eluted with PETase during the cationic exchange chromatography. Moreover the difference in 
molecular weights between PETase (27 kDa) and cytochrome c (12 kDa) was not sufficiently different for the two 
proteins to be efficiently separated by size exclusion chromatography.
The recombinant PETase is active. To investigate the activity of the algal-expressed PETase, PET pure 
film and post-consumer plastic (PCP) substrates were incubated with the enzyme and control solutions then 
assessed by semi-contact atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging in air (Fig. 3). It is clear that the recombinant 
PETase can modify the morphology of both PET and PCP samples. Specifically, in samples incubated with the 
enzyme, the formation of holes can be observed by the presence of darker spots, while no holes are visible in the 
control samples (i.e. the same experimental procedures without the enzyme). To quantitatively evaluate the mor-
phological changes on the surfaces due to PETase activity, the average surface roughness of the samples σrms and 
the lateral correlation length ξ were calculated. These variables correspond to a measure of the texture of the sur-
face, and the distance range over which points in one region of space are correlated with those in another region,

TN72 DNA validate the sensitivity of the assay for detecting even a single copy of the parental DNA remaining 
in the transformant chloroplast.

 respectively44 (Fig. 3). PETase activity resulted in a decrease of ξ in both materials: PET film samples (Fig. 3A,B) 
displayed a decrease by an order of magnitude, from 2.2 ± 0.6 µm (control sample) to 0.22 ± 0.08 µm (when incu-
bated with enzyme), while, for PCP samples (Fig.  3C,D), a reduction of 60% was observed, from 0.53 ± 0.1 µm 
(control sample) to 0.21 ± 0.03 µm (when incubated with enzyme). The average values of ξ were obtained from 
three images of each sample and interestingly, after incubation with the enzyme, they were similar (≅ 0.2 µm) for 
both materials (Fig. 4B). Since there were no other sources of degradation in sample reactions we could ascribe 
those values exclusively to the PETase activity, and, in particular, the presence, the dimension and the density of 
the holes on the surfaces confirmed the functionality of the enzyme. Conversely, the surface roughness variation 
(Δσrms) significantly increased for PCP samples (from 4.5 ± 0.6 nm to 22 ± 3 nm with ΔσrmsPCP =  + 17.5 nm), while 
it does not change for PET film samples (from 4.8 ± 0.5 nm to 4.4 ± 0.4 nm with ΔσrmsPET = − 0.4 nm) (Fig. 4A,B). 
This may suggest that the chemical and physical stress suffered by the plastic samples during the incubation 
could affect more one material than the other. A possible explanation is that the technical-grade PET foil is more 
resilient to stress than postconsumer plastic foil (in fact ΔσrmsPCP < ΔσrmsPET), but, in any case both materials were 
affected by the enzyme activity.
To corroborate the analysis of the enzyme activity, the PET film was transformed into powder and PETase 
was incubated for 48 h in the presence of 2 mg of PET and BHET powder using the same experimental con-
ditions tested before. Simultaneously, the post-consumer plastic (PCP) was similarly tested. The results are 
summarized in Fig.  5 and the calibration curves for TPA and BHET standards are in supplementary material 
(Supplementary Figs. S7 and S8a,b) together with two chromatograms from the reaction supernatants (Supple-
mentary Fig. S8c,d). As expected, PETase was active on all the polymer samples. PET powder digestion yielded 
0.02 mM of TPA which is line with the data in the literature for the WT  protein45. The BHET powder was not 
completely digested thus it was not possible to obtain the MHET data for standard values acquisition; nevertheless 
it produced 0.8 mM of monomer when in contact with the enzyme (Fig. 5A). For the PCP sample at a reaction 
time of 48 h it was not possible to detect any significantly amount of TPA since the reaction was conducted at 
low temperature (30 °C) and for a relatively short period but the main product released by the PCP sample was 
BHET at 0.20 mM (Fig. 5B).
Discussion
PETase is a recently discovered hydrolase enzyme acting on PET and many advances have already been made 
to increase PETase catalytic activity and its ability to work at high  temperatures15,19–22,24,25,45. With a view to its 
potential significance in an industrial context and the need to discover new PETases from various organisms 
in this work we describe a platform for producing such enzymes in the chloroplast of C. reinhardtii.  Here we

obtained ~ 5 mg of recombinant I. sakaiensis PETase (although, not completely pure) from 40 g of wet biomass 
(yield of purified mixture ≅ 0.012%). While the recombinant protein yield is lower than that of bacterial  systems46, 
the activity of the algal-expressed enzyme in terms of concentration of released TPA is in line with the published 
data for the wt  protein45,47. Moreover, microalgae offer several potential advantages, such as reduced scale-up 
costs and use of the algal biomass for extraction of useful byproducts; carotenoids, pigments, proteins, and 
vitamins that can be used for the production of nutraceuticals, animal feed additives, cosmetics, or for energy 
 production29,48–51. Expression in the chloroplasts has the advantage of precision targeting of transgenic DNA into 
a selected site in the plastome via homologous recombination, stable and high-level expression of transgenes in 
the absence of selection, and the ability to compartmentalize and target potentially toxic recombinant proteins 
within the chloroplast. Moreover, the use of photosynthetic restoration in the transformation of strain TN72

avoids the use of selection markers based on antibiotic-resistance genes and circumvents concerns over escape 
of such genes via lateral gene transfer. Finally, the pilot scale PETase production carried out here (10 L culture 
medium), allowed for the first time the expression of a sufficient amount of recombinant protein for purifica-
tion, and this will facilitate further characterization of the enzyme kinetics for different PETase variants with 
improved PET  activity19. Interestingly, the purification of the recombinant PETase by means of cationic exchange 
chromatography resulted in the presence of a cytochrome c with a pI similar to that of the PETase (9.39 and 9.65, 
respectively) in the final fraction, implying that the two proteins stayed together during all the purification steps. 
Considering this result, it is worth considering if the cytochrome c could affect the activity of PETase enzyme in 
the reaction mixture. Cytochrome c  is a well characterized and ubiquitous protein that can interact with vari-
ous molecules (i.e. phospholipids through electrostatic and hydrophobic bonds) 52–55, and in some cases (e.g. a 
M80A mutant) it can exert a catalytic  activity56–58, but primarily cytochrome c  is an electron transfer protein 
working only in the presence of electron donors that, in this specific case, were not added to the reaction mixture. 
Therefore, we can exclude the possibility that the cytochrome c  contributed to the PETase enzymatic reaction. 
Moreover, the reaction yields measured are in accordance with those of the pure enzyme.
The aim of this work was the production of an active PETase in the microalgal chloroplast. This first suc-
cessful demonstration of transgenic strain of C. reinhardtii capable of synthesizing the I. sakaiensis PETase into 
an active form, paves the way for future studies focused on production of improved PETase variants and other 
plastics-degrading enzymes in this sustainable platform.
Methods
Materials. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strain TN72 (CC-5168, Chlamydomonas Resource Center: www.  
chlam ycoll ection. org) was used to generate the transgenic lines in this study as described  previously41,59. All 
lines were maintained on tris-acetate-phosphate (TAP) medium supplemented with 1.5% agar unless otherwise 
stated. Liquid cultures were cultivated in TAP medium at 25 °C, with agitation at 125 rpm. All lines were illu-
minated with continuous white light at 50 μE/m2/s, with the light sensitive TN72 parental line protected with a 
white paper cover to reduce light intensity by approximately an order of magnitude.
Cloning procedures. DNA manipulations were performed following standard  protocols60, including 
transformation of chemically competent E. coli DH5α. Oligonucleotide primers were purchased from Eurofins 
Genomics (Ebersberg, Germany) while restriction enzymes and T4 DNA ligase for cloning procedures are pur-
chased from NEB (Ipswich, MA, USA) and Thermo Scientific (Waltham, MA, USA). The coding sequence for I. 
sakaiensis PETase (PETase Uniprot: A0A0K8P6T7; Gene: ISF6_4831; EC:3.1.1.101), together with a Strep-tag at 
the N terminus, was codon-optimized for the C. reinhardtii chloroplast using the Codon Usage Database (www. 
kazusa. or. jp/ codon) with SapI and SphI sites added for cloning into the pSRSapI transformation vector (Sup-
plementary Fig. S1)61. The DNA was synthesized by IDT (Integrated DNA Technologies, Inc., Coralville, Iowa-
USA), and was cloned into the transformation vector by standard molecular  techniques60.
Transformation of the C. reinhardtii chloroplast. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii was transformed by 
the glass bead method as described  previously41,62. 400  mL transformation cultures were grown to early log 
phase (1–2 ×  106 cells/mL) and harvested by centrifugation at 3000×g. Cells were resuspended in sterile high 
salt minimal (HSM) medium to a density of 2 ×  108 cells/mL, and 300 μL added to sterilized 5-mL tests tube 
containing 300 mg sterile 400–625 μm diameter glass beads and 10 μg plasmid DNA. Tubes were agitated by 
vortex at maximum speed for 15 s, then mixed with 4 mL molten HSM supplemented with 0.5% agar at 42 °C 
and immediately spread on HSM plates supplemented with 1.5% agar and 100 μg/mL ampicillin. Plates were 
sealed with parafilm and incubated at 25 °C in dim light (~ 2 μE/m2/s) overnight then transferred to moderate 
light (~ 50 μE/m2/s)32,41. Transformant colonies were picked after 3–4 weeks and restreaked to single colonies on 
selective media until homoplasmy was achieved, typically after 2–3 restreaks.

Genotyping of transformant lines. Lines were assessed by PCR analysis using a three-primer strategy 
as described  previously41. In each case a forward flanking primer was designed outside of the left homology arm 
used for transformation, with reverse primers designed within the parental and transformed cassettes respec-
tively. Details of primers used are given in the supplementary data (Supplementary Table S1). Insertion of the 
target PETase CDS was further confirmed by PCR amplification of the expression cassette followed by Sanger 
sequencing of the PCR product. Total genomic DNA is extracted from a small amount of cells using the Chelex 
100  method63 and PCR amplification is carried out with Phusion DNA polymerase (Thermo Scientific) accord-
ing to the manufacturer’s instructions. In this strategy (see Fig.  1A), a plastome specific primer (P1) is used in 
conjunction with two other primers in a three primer reaction. A second primer (P2) binds to a terminator 
element (TrbcL) in the parental TN72 strain, in which the endogenous psbH gene (essential for photosynthesis) 
is disrupted with an aminoglycoside 3’-adenylyltransferase (aadA) expression cassette, to generate a band of 
878 bp. The third primer (P3) binds to a promoter element (PpsaA) in the transformed genotype, containing the 
PETase expression cassette and the restored of psbH to give a band of 1037 bp. Dilution control PCR (1:100 and 
1:200) were performed with TN72 DNA, to ensure that the PCR reaction was sufficiently sensitive to detect the 
parental DNA in the TN72:PETase PCR if the parental DNA were present at low/single copy numbers.
Scale up cultivation, cell breakage, and preparation of soluble protein extract. Chlamydomonas 
reinhardtii expressing PETase cells line was inoculated in 20 mL of liquid TAP medium and grown at, 25 °C, 
100 rpm and intensity light of 50 μE   m−2  s−1 for 4 days. Cell growth was monitored over time using a Bürker 
chamber and the rate of increase was obtained. Cells were let grown until a concentration of 4 ×  106 cells/mL 
was reached and then an inoculum of 2 ×  105 cells/mL was scaled twice, each with 1:10 dilutions. A further scale 
up was conducted using a 10 L homemade bioreactor. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3000g, 4 °C for 
15 min and disrupted by 20 sonication cycles of 1 min each. In order to remove cell debris and hydrophobic 
proteins, a precipitation step in presence of  (NH4)2SO4 1 M was then followed by dialysis vs 25 mM phosphate 
buffer pH 7 and finally loaded into the column.
Protein purification. PETase was purified exploiting the calculated pI of 9.6 and the molecular weight 
of 27,559  Da, using a two-step reliable purification protocol with a cationic exchange HiPrep™ SP HP 16/10 
(Cytiva) chromatography. The eluted fractions containing PETase were collected and concentrated by  Amicon® 
membrane ultrafiltration spin columns with a 5000 Da cutoff to a < 2 mL volume, and loaded on a size exclusion 
SEC separation using a HiLoad™ Superdex™ 75 (GE Healthcare) column. PETase was eluted from the HiPrep™ 
SP HP 16/10 column across a 25 mM sodium posphate buffer pH 7/25 mM sodium posphate buffer pH 7, 0.5 M 
NaCl gradient. Fractions containing the protein were pooled, concentrated, and loaded onto a SEC HiLoad™ 
Superdex™ 75 column and eluted isocratically in the presence of 200 mM phosphate buffer pH 7; 0.15 M NaCl. 
The eluted fractions from the two chromatographic steps were assessed by SDS-PAGE and western blotting.
Tandem mass spectrometry. For UHPLC–HRMS analysis, dry extracted peptides were resuspended in 
50 μL of a mixture of water:acetonitrile:formic acid 95:3:2, sonicated for 10 min at room temperature and cen-
trifuged at 12,100g for 10 min. A Thermo Scientific Dionex Ultimate 3000 195 UHPLC coupled to a Thermo 
high-resolution Q Exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany) was used for the analyses. 
Centroided MS and MS2 spectra were recorded from 200 to 2000 m/z in Full MS/dd-MS2 (TOP2) mode. Precur-
sor dynamic exclusion (6 s) and apex triggering (1–5 s) were set; peptide-like isotope pattern ions were preferred. 
The mass spectrometer was calibrated before the start of the analyses; an initial segment (0.1–0.7 min) with a 
lock mass (391.28429) was included in the MS 204 method. For protein identification, raw data, converted into 
mascot generic format using MsConvert (v. 3.0.10730, ProteoWizard tools; 25), were searched against Swiss-
Prot for peptide sequences and an in-house database. Trypsin was selected as the proteolytic enzyme; oxidized 
methionine (M) was set as variable modifications while carbamidomethylation of cysteine (C) was set as fixed 
modifications in the search parameters. One missed cleavage was allowed. Mass tolerances were set at 10 ppm for 
the precursor ions (peak detection mismatch #13C = 1) and 0.5 Da for all the samples. An automatic decoy data-
base search was used to estimate the false discovery rate; probability threshold was trimmed to get a FDR < 1%.
Activity assays. Purified recombinant PETase was tested against 0.25 mm thick polyethylene terephthalate 
(PET) film (Goodfellow Cambridge Ltd) and post-consumer packaging (PCP). 200 μL digestion reactions were 
set up with 6 × 4 mm pieces of clean substrate, 10 μL of purified protein fraction or a control solution in Phos-
phate buffer 25 mM pH 7. Reaction tubes were incubated at 30 °C shaking (250 rpm) for 96 h. Solid substrate was 
then removed and rinsed in subsequent steps with 1% SDS. Protein activity was assessed by analyzing the plastic 
pieces after incubation with the enzyme by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Morphological characterization of 
PET and PCP samples was performed using an NT-MDT SMENA Solver platform (Moscow, Russia); the analy-
sis was performed in semi-contact mode and the images analyzed using Gwyddion 2.61 freeware (http:// gwydd 
ion. net). PET powder was obtained as following; polyethylene terephthalate (16.67 mg of PET film) and 2 mL 
of p-cresol were placed in a round-bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer. The flask was immersed in a 
preheated (70 °C) oil bath and the mixture was stirred at 500 rpm for 1 h. After PET solubilization, the solution 
was dropwise added to 100 mL of ethanol under vigorous stirring. The precipitate was separated by filtration, 
then washed several times with distilled water, and finally dried in an oven (70 °C).
HPLC analysis. PET hydrolysis products were desiccated and resuspended in 50  μL of DMSO and then 
loaded into the HPLC System. The separation occurred using an Agilent 1260 Infinity II HPLC System equipped

with a G7114A 1260 VWD UV–Vis detector and an Agilent InfinityLab Poroshell 120 C18 column (Thermo 
Scientific™). An isocratic mobile phase consisting of 80% of (10%formic acid (v/v)) solvent (A) and 20% of ace-
tonitrile (solvent B) was used at a flow rate of 1 mL/min during a 15 min gradient which gradually shifted the 
mobile phase composition to 50% of acetonitrile. The concentrations of hydrolyzed products (BHET, MHET, 
and TPA) were detected at 254 nm and calculated from the areas of the adsorption peaks using calibration curves 
established from TPA and BHET standard solutions. The retention times of TPA, and BHET were about 1.65, 
and 2.4 min, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S9a,b). The MHET obtained by hydrolyzing BHET standard solu-
tion using PETase has a retention time of 2.056 (Supplementary Fig. S9c,d).
