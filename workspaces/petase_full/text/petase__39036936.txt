Enzymatic degradation of polymers holds promise for advanc-
ing towards a bio-based economy. However, the bulky nature
of polymers presents challenges in accessibility for biocatalysts,
hindering depolymerization reactions. Beyond the impact of
crystallinity, polymer chains can reside in different conforma-
tions affecting binding efficiency to the enzyme active site. We
previously showed that the gauche and trans chain conformers
associated with crystalline and amorphous regions of the
synthetic polyethylene terephthalate (PET) display different
affinity to PETase, thus affecting the depolymerization rate.
However, structural-function relationships for biopolymers
remain poorly understood in biocatalysis. In this study, we
explored the biodegradation of previously synthesized bio-
polyesters made from a rigid bicyclic chiral terpene-based diol
and copolymerized with various renewable diesters. Herein,
four of those polyesters spanning from semi-aromatic to
aliphatic were subjected to enzymatic degradations in concert
with induced-fit docking (IFD) analyses. The monomer yield
following enzymatic depolymerization by IsPETase S238 A, Dura
and LCC ranged from 2 % to 17 % without any further pre-
treatment step. The degradation efficiency was found to
correlate with the extent of matched substrate and enzyme
conformations revealed by IFD, regardless of the actual reaction
temperature employed. Our findings demonstrate the impor-
tance of conformational selection in enzymatic depolymeriza-
tion of biopolymers. A straight or twisted conformation of the
polymer chain is crucial in biocatalytic degradation by showing
different affinities to enzyme ground-state conformers. This
work highlights the importance of considering the conforma-
tional match between the polymer and the enzyme to optimize
the biocatalytic degradation efficiency of biopolymers, provid-
ing valuable insights for the development of sustainable
bioprocesses.
Introduction
Synthetic polymers found in medical devices, textiles, com-
puters, and many other applications have become vital for life.
The overall polymer market is mainly composed of the
following polymers: polyethylene (PE) 36 %, polypropylene (PP)
19 %, polyvinylchloride (PVC) 12 %, and polyester 21 %. The
production of polymer fabrics is largely made up of poly-
ethylene terephthalate (PET) (70 %).
[1,2]
The production of
polyesters in 2022 increased to 63 million tons in comparison to
the 61 million tons produced in 2021. By 2030, global polyester
fiber production is expected to grow up to 145 million tons.
[2]
Polyesters are versatile materials that can be synthesized from a
wide variety of monomers; including bio-mass-derived
monomers.
[4,5]
via various polymerization routes, including
polycondensation and ring-opening polymerization (ROP). A
prominent example is polyfuranoates (PEF) in which the fossil
-based terephthalic acid was replaced by the bio-based
monomer 2,5-furan dicarboxylic acid (FDCA)).
[3,4]
Although polyesters contain hydrolyzable bonds, they can
still withstand biodegradation.
[5]
The generation of biodegrad-
able and fully recyclable bio-based polymers is necessary to
achieve circular materials
[6]
with mechanical and thermal
properties reminiscent to fossil-based materials. The most
common recycling methods for polyesters are chemical and
mechanical recycling
[7]
and the combination of these ap-
proaches can effectively recycle polyesters, but at a great cost
of energy and under harsh conditions.
[8]
To circumvent these
issues, focus has recently been on biocatalysts that can hydro-
lyze ester bonds under mild conditions.
[9]
Employing water-
based systems for polymer recycling at mild temperatures is an
alternative to the classical chemical and thermomechanical
recycling routes. Since synthetic polyesters have been around
for a relatively short time, there hasn’t been enough time for
nature to evolve existing enzymes to become efficient enough
to replace mechanical and chemical recycling techniques.
In 2005, a cutinase from the organism Thermobifida fusca
(TfH) was found to partially degrade PET.
[10]
Moreover, in 2016,
the Ideonella sakaiensis PETase (IsPETase) was isolated from a
plastic bottle found in a plastic landfill and was shown to be
able to use PET as its partial carbon source.
[11]
These two
enzymes have an evolutionary relationship by sharing ca. 51 %
sequence identity and display the classical α/β -hydrolase
fold.
[12,13]
Even though their sequence identity is moderate, they

share important structural characteristics as these two enzymes
have in common that their active site is located on their surface,
facilitating the bulky polymeric substrate to access the catalytic
triad. Enzyme engineering strategies including rational design,
directed evolution, and machine learning approaches
[14,15]
have
been used to obtain more thermostable variants of IsPETase,
e. g. the Dura PETase variant that has a melting temperature
(T
m
) of 80 ° C
[16]
; allowing for degradation of PET at temperatures
exceeding the glass-transition temperature (T
g
), and resulting in
increased monomer yields.
As a complementary strategy to improve enzyme thermo-
stability, enzyme-catalyzed depolymerization of polyesters can
be improved by better understanding the enzyme and sub-
strate conformations
[18,19]
and their interplay with each other to
form productive complexes prone to undergo catalysis. Hitherto
structure-functional relationship data has mainly focused on the
impact of material crystallinity and molecular weight on the
enzymatic depolymerization rate of synthetic polyesters.
[17,18]
In
our previous work, we showed the importance of conforma-
tional selection
20
for IsPETase, its variants and LCC cutinase
[12,19]
(Leaf and Branch Compost Cutinase) for efficient hydrolysis of
PET (Figure 1a) into its constituent monomers.
[20,21]
Still, the
importance of biomolecular recognition of discrete polymer
chain conformations remains poorly understood,
[20]
especially
for biopolymers.
For this study, we combined induced-fit docking with
enzyme-catalyzed depolymerization studies to shed light on
structure-functional relationships underpinning the biodegrada-

tion of four bio-based polyesters synthesized from a rigid
pinene-derived diol co-polymerized with esters of FDCA and
aliphatic bio-mass derived diacids (Figure 1b).
[25]
The nature of
the four polymers investigated varied from crystalline aromatic
to amorphous. NMR and SEC analysis revealed the ability of two
IsPETase variants (S238 A and Dura PETase
[16]
) and a cutinase
(LCC) to effectively depolymerize both crystalline and amor-
phous polyesters without any mechanical or chemical pre-
treatment step; irrespectively of the reaction temperature that
was ambient for IsPETase S238 A (30 ° C) and 70 ° C for LCC
cutinase and Dura PETase, respectively. The degradation
efficiency of the enzymes was associated with their capabilities
to harbor different polymer conformations, and particularly
with respect to how the diol chains in the polymer unit are
organized relative to one another (see Figure 1b, top) resulting
in either straight or twisted chains.
Results and Discussion
The four polyesters shown in Figure 1b were produced by
transesterification followed by polycondensation of the ter-
pene-based diol called trans-hydroxy nopol (herein referred to
as, HN). The monomer HN was synthesized from (R)-(  )-Nopol
which is a natural product and commercially available pinene-
based compound that can be synthesized from α-pinene.
[22]
Since α-Pinene is inert, and cannot be used as such for polymer
synthesis without first being subjected to functionalization, a
retro-synthetic route starting from (R)-(  )-Nopol was used
[21]
involving hydroboration followed by oxidation to obtain HN
(see methods). Using the bulky bicyclic diol (HN) in concert with
the bio-based dimethyl esters of 2,5-furan dicarboxylic acid
(FDCA), succinic acid (DMS), adipic acid (DMA), and sebacic acid
(DMSc) resulted in one crystalline (HN_FDCA) polyester, and
three amorphous aliphatic polyesters (HN_DMS, HN_DMA, HN_
DMSc); respectively. Their molecular weights ranged from ca
5000–18000 g mol
  1
(Figure 1b, bottom). Polymerization of the
bulky rigid diol (HN) with the rigid aromatic diester (FDCA)
resulted in a syndiotactic polymer that is highly crystalline,
whereas the flexible aliphatic diesters reacted with the diol (HN)
randomly to afford amorphous atactic polymers.
[21]
While the
difference in morphological properties confers different applica-
tion possibilities, we hypothesized that any associated differ-
ence in the conformational landscape of the polymer chains
could alter bio-degradability by PETases. Accordingly, we
focused on the structural relationship of these novel bio-based
polyesters towards enzymatic degradation.
Enzymatic Depolymerization of Polyesters
The resulting terpene-derived polyesters were shown to be
susceptible to enzymatic depolymerization by all three enzymes
investigated, two IsPETase variants (S238 A and Dura) and a
cutinase (LCC). These enzymes have previously been shown by
us to display a preference towards either trans-rich (referring to
the dihedral angle of the ethylene glycol unit, S238 A PETase)
or gauche-rich (Dura PETase and LCC cutinase) polyethylene
terephthalate (PET)-derived substrates.
[20,21]
To study whether
analogous chain conformations in biopolymers could affect the
enzymatic rate, depolymerization reactions of the four poly-
esters shown in Figure 1b were performed at the optimal
temperature for each enzyme for 72 hours. For S238 A PETase,
the reaction was performed at 30 ° C, and for Dura PETase and
LCC cutinase at 70 ° C.
Following the enzymatic reactions, the obtained polymeric
products were first subjected to SEC analysis to confirm the
hydrolysis of the polymer chain and to be able to determine
the molecular weight (M
n
) of the resulting oligomers. The
starting molecular weights of the polyesters were 5,180 g mol
  1,
10,260 g mol
  1
, 14,180 g mol
  1,
and 17,620 g mol
  1
for HN_
FDCA, HN_DMS, HN_DMA and HN_DMSc respectively. The HN_
FDCA polyester was the most swiftly degraded by S238 A
PETase enzyme variant concerning the release of monomers
(calculated from
1
H NMR, see Figure 2c, Table 1). Also, the
resulting oligomeric product (Figure 2a and 2b) had a M
n
of
1,653 g mol
  1
suggesting that the enzyme successfully de-
graded the polymer into shorter chain oligomers. Both the Dura
PETase and LCC had a higher activity towards the amorphous
aliphatic polyesters, and HN_DMSc polyester being the most
susceptible one to degradation. The M
n
obtained after
enzymatic degradation was 1,649 g mol
  1
and 1,614 g mol
  1
.
The results obtained from SEC were further corroborated by
NMR spectra of the polymer samples after enzymatic degrada-
tion to study the release of the monomers.
From Figure 2c and Supplementary Figures 1–3, it is clear
that the sample contains peaks that are matching with that of
the monomer (HN) as well as the polymers. Peaks appearing at
ca. 4.5 ppm (   OH), 3.5 ppm, 2.5 ppm, and 1.5 ppm in the NMR
spectra of the polyesters after enzymatic degradation corre-
spond to the monomer peaks, and the intensities of the same
varied according to the percentage of the diol monomer
generated. The remaining peaks of those that correspond to
the monomer were merged with the oligomer peaks. For the
crystalline polymer (HN_FDCA), the trans-selective PETase
S238 A variant showed superior activity, yielding 17 % of the
monomers, in contrast to the ca 7 % by Dura and LCC for the
same substrate, respectively. The S238 A PETase had a clear
preference to the semi-aromatic FDCA-derived crystalline sub-
strate, in which the responding polymer chains will preferably
adopt extended conformations.
[23–25]
The enzymes Dura and
LCC, that are selective towards gauche PET-derived
substrates,
[20,21]
yielded a higher percentage of monomers for
the aliphatic polyesters in which the chains are more flexible
and thus prone to adopt twisted conformations. These results
aligned with our previous studies that showed that the
conformation of the substrate is vital for catalytic activity for
PET.
[20]
The polyester with the longer chain length (HN_DMSc)
was preferred by LCC, yielding 10.8 % of monomers and Dura
yielded 12.6 %; while S238 A barely reacted, releasing only up to
2 % of the monomers. It is important to note that the
biopolyesters did not undergo any pre-treatment step. Decreas-
ing the molecular weight (M
n
, M
w
) of the substrates while
increasing the surface area can allow the enzymes to more

Induced Fit Docking of Polyesters to S238 A, Dura and LCC
We hypothesized that enzymatic depolymerization efficiency
towards the given polyesters would depend not only on the
molecular weight and the repeating-unit carbon chain length
but also on their preference towards trans-like and gauche-like
chain conformations (schematically shown in Figure 1b, top). To
better understand the binding ability of the different polyester
conformations to the enzymes studied, we performed induced
fit docking (IFD) calculations of oligomers (trimers) representing
the biopolymers as substrates. We introduced the mutation
Ser238Ala in IsPETase for the calculations and we have
previously seen that this S238 A mutation conferred this
enzyme variant a preference towards trans-PET-substrates,
[20,21]
opposite to the wild-type or its thermostable analogue Dura. It
should be noted that all ligands were prepared using the
LigPrep tool in Maestro, resulting in polyesters with retained
anti-conformation of the diol oxygens originating from the diol
monomer, even though the absolute stereochemistry of the
alcohol chain in reference to the cyclobutyl ring in the
monomer could change after the structures underwent an
energy-minimization step. After the ligands were prepared, they
were used to find the best docking poses for each enzyme. We
could observe productive binding of the oligomeric substrates
representing the responding biopolymer chain to all the
enzymes; manifested by a close-to Van der Waals nucleophilic
attack distance between the Oγ of Ser160 in the PETases and
Ser165 in LCC cutinase to the scissile carbonyl carbon (Figure 3,
Table 2). The top-ranked pose of each enzyme-substrate con-
former pair is shown in Figure 3. The corresponding data for the
dihedral angle between the diol oxygens of the reacting
monomer unit and the distance between the catalytic Ser Oγ
and the scissile carbonyl carbon atom for HN_FDCA, HN_DMS,
HN_DMA, and HN_DMSc are described in Table 2.
The synthesized biopolymers showed different physical
properties, the HN_FDCA polyester is highly crystalline while
HN_DMS, HN_DMA, and HN_DMSc are amorphous. Based on
the results obtained from the IFD analysis, we were able to
better understand the structure-functional relationship between
the enzymes and these biopolymers. It is clear that the S238 A
PETase is more active in the degradation of the crystalline
polyester HN FDCA, whereas Dura PETase and LCC cutinase are
more active in the degradation of the amorphous polyesters. In
fact, Dura PETase and LCC cutinase show a similar degree of
activity for depolymerization of the amorphous polyesters HN_
DMS, HN_DMA, HN_DMSc that have a varying chain length (see
Table 1). Interestingly, from Table 2 it is evident that the
dihedral angles of the oligomers of the top-scoring docking
poses exclusively represent the straight-chain trans-like con-
formation for S238 A for all of the substrates. In contrast, Dura
and LCC show preference towards twisted chain gauche-like
polymer conformations that are abundant in amorphous
structures where the chains are mobile.
Interestingly, from the docking results we were able to see
that the wobbling residue W185
[26]
in the IsPETase variants
seems to act as a gate to dictate in which conformation the
biopolymer substrate will bind.
[27]
As shown in Figure 4, the
Dura PETase, W185 is in a perpendicular orientation blocking
the polyester to bind in a straight chain, enforcing the chain to
adopt a gauche-like twisted conformation. Conversely, the
S238 A PETase variant W185 is flat allowing the chain to bind to
the active site as a straight chain. The enzymes’ activity towards
the different biopolymers seems to rely highly on conforma-
tions adopted by the polymeric chains in amorphous and
crystalline regions and their different affinity to enzyme active
sites. For the more crystalline polymer (HN_FDCA), the packed
extended conformation is preferred; one that suitably binds to
S238 A PETase whereas Dura PETase and LCC cutinase prefer
amorphous substrates with more mobile chains.
Conclusions
There has not been enough time for enzymes to develop to
degrade man-made polyesters efficiently, including synthetic
polymers from renewable resources. However, by understand-
ing the fundamental structure-function relationship between an
enzyme and its substrate, optimizing the depolymerization
activity towards bio-based polyesters could be facilitated. We
have previously shown the importance of matching discrete
polymer geometries to enzyme ground-state conformations for
efficient hydrolysis of PET.
[20]
Herein, we have studied the
depolymerization of the novel set of terpene-derived biopol-
ymers HN_FDCA, HN_DMS, HN_DMA, and HN_DMSc by the
S238 A PETase, Dura PETase, and LCC cutinase and our data
suggests a general importance of conformational selection that
extends beyond PET. According to this model, the basal
propensity of a polymer chain to adopt either an extended
straight conformation or twisted chain and their responding
affinities to enzyme active sites should be considered in
enzymatic degradation, alongside already established parame-
ters including molecular weight, degree of crystallinity, surface
hydrophilicity, and water absorption.

Expression of S238 A and Dura PETase and LCC Cutinase
All the genes for the corresponding enzymes were subcloned into
PET-21b (+) plasmids and transformed into Escherichia coli CD43
cells that were grown on Nutrient Agar plates with 100 μg mL
  1
of
ampicillin (Sigma Aldrich, USA). The proteins were expressed and
produced the following way: The cells transformed with the
enzyme plasmids were precultured in 2YT media (16 g/L tryptone,
10 g/L yeast extract, and 5 g/L NaCl in MiliQ water) with
100 μg mL
  1
of ampicillin overnight. The next day, the cultures were
inoculated into 200 mL of 2YT and grown at 37 ° C under shaking at
200 rpm until an OD
600
of 0.6 was reached. Once the desired OD
600
was reached, 1 mM of isopropyl β-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG)
was added and the cells were incubated for 20 hours at 20 ° C
160 rpm. After the incubation time was finished, the cell pellets
were harvested by centrifugation at 4,800×g for 20 minutes.
Purification of S238 A- and Dura- PETase and LCC Cutinase
The cells were lysed to obtain the expressed proteins by B-PER
complete lysis buffer containing 20 mM imidazole at 25 ° C 80 rpm
for 20 minutes. After the lysis of the cells, the supernatant
containing the crude enzyme was collected after centrifugation. To
purify the enzymes, an ÄKTA Start (GE Healthcare, Sweden) instru-
ment was used. The HisTrap FF column was equilibrated with
washing buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate, 500 mM NaCl, and
40 mM imidazole) and the enzyme was eluted with an imidazole
gradient (from 40 mM to 300 mM) in the same buffer at a flow rate
of 1 ml/min. Finally, the enzymes were desalted using a PD-10
column into 10 mM Tris-HCl buffer pH 7.5. Proteins were confirmed
by Sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide (SDS-Page) gel electro-
phoresis with a gradient of 4–15 % (Mini-Protean TGX Stain-Free,
BioRad, Sweden). The SeeBlueTM Plus2 (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
USA) pre-stained protein standard was used as a marker.
Enzymatic Degradation of Polymers
The polymers HN DMS, HN DMA, HN DMSc, and HN FDCA were
subjected to enzymatic polymerization. For each reaction, 6 μg of
purified enzyme (S238 A PETase, LCC cutinase or Dura PETase) were
added to 1 mL of potassium phosphate buffer 50 mM (pH 7.5) with
15 mg of polymer as substrate. The polymeric substrate was not
subjected to any pre-treatment. The samples were incubated for
72 hours at 30 ° C for the reaction with the S238 A PETase and 70 ° C
for the reactions with LCC cutinase and Dura PETase. Finally, the
resulting products from the depolymerization reaction were freeze-
dried using a Heto LyoLab 3000.
Proton Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (
1
H NMR)
1
H NMR spectra were recorded using a Bruker Avance AM 400 NMR
instrument using CDCl
3
as solvent. The polymers were solubilized
and submitted for proton analysis with 128 scans.
Figure 4. Conformational selection for biopolymer degradation. a) The enzyme Dura PETase is shown with the HN FDCA substrate docked into its active site.
The “wobbling” residue W185 (blue) is positioned in a way that does not allow the biopolymer to bind as a straight chain, causing the substrate to acquire a
gauche-like conformation when bound to the active site (parts shown in green). The catalytic S160 is highlighted in bright pink. b) The enzyme S238 A PETase
is shown with the HN FDCA substrate docked into its active site. The “wobbling” residue W185 (blue) adopts a flat (perpendicular) orientation which allows
for the biopolymer to bind in a straight chain when complexed to the active site (part shown in green). The catalytic S160 is highlighted in bright pink.

Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC)
SEC elugrams were obtained on a Malvern GPCMAX instrument
equipped with PLgel 5 μm guard column (7.5×50 mm) and two
PLgel 5 μm MIXED   D (300×7.5 mm) analysis columns kept at 35 ° C.
M
n
and Ð values are reported versus a calibration of narrow
disperse polystyrene standards. The eluent consisted of HPLC grade
CHCl
3
containing 2 % (v/v) toluene. Polyesters were dissolved in SEC
eluent and kept for 12 h. Afterward, the samples from the
enzymatic degradation were filtered using a membrane filter and
transferred into a special SEC vial, and a volume of 100 μL of each
sample was injected.
Induced Fit Docking (IFD)
X-ray crystal structures of IsPETase (PDB ID: 6EQE
[13]
), Dura PETase
(PDB ID: 6KY5
[16]
) and LCC–Cutinase (PDB ID: 4EB0
[31]
) were down-
loaded from the RCSB Protein Data Bank. All protein structures
were prepared for IFD docking using the protein preparation wizard
in the software Schrödinger Maestro Suite (Schrödinger, LCC, USA).
For the Dura PETase, we retained only chain A for the IFD
calculations. All crystallographic water molecules were removed,
and the missing hydrogens were added at a set pH of 7.5. The
polyester substrates were prepared in Maestro using the LigPrep
wizard and were all energy-minimized using the OPLS4 force field.
Finally, all four of the polyesters were used to generate IFD
calculations with all three of the enzymes.
