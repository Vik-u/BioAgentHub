Abstract 
Cell-free expression (CFE) has shown recent utility in prototyping enzymes for discovery efforts. In this work, CFE is demonstrated as an 
effective tool to screen putative polyester polyurethane degrading enzyme sequences sourced from metagenomic analysis of biofilms 
prospected on aircraft and vehicles. An automated fluid handler with a controlled temperature block is used to assemble the numerous 
30 μL CFE reactions to provide more consistent results over human assembly. In sum, 13 putative hydrolase enzymes from the biofilm 
organisms as well as a previously verified, polyester-degrading cutinase were expressed using in-house E. coli extract and minimal linear 
templates. The enzymes were then tested for esterase activity directly in extract using nitrophenyl conjugated substrates, showing 
highest sensitivity to shorter substrates (4-nitrophenyl hexanoate and 4-nNitrophenyl valerate). This screen identified 10 enzymes 
with statistically significant activities against these substrates; however, all were lower in measured relative activity, on a CFE volume 
basis, to the established cutinase control. This approach portends the use of CFE and reporter probes to rapidly prototype, screen and 
design for synthetic polymer degrading enzymes from environmental consortia.

1. Introduction
Bio-corrosion is a costly threat to modern-day infrastructure 
and transportation networks but may also, simultaneously, hold 
key information to sustainable disposal of recalcitrant, synthetic 
materials such as plastics. Bio-corrosion refers to the deteriora-
tion of metal or nonmetal materials caused by the influence of 
microorganisms typically growing as a biofilm (1). It is observed 
in many environments and media including seawater, freshwa-
ter, soils, foodstuffs, demineralized water, sewage, aircraft petrol, 
human plasma and process chemicals (2). These microbes can be 
studied to determine how to best protect against these destructive 
effects and can also provide a rich source of prospected enzymes 
for the degradation of materials such as plastics.
Plastics are a staple of modern life. Starting with natural poly-
mers, horn, waxes, rubbers and resins (3), progressing to the 
discovery of vulcanized rubber and polystyrene (PS) in 1839 ( 4), 
they have progressed to be their own large, synthetic material 
class. As plastics are lightweight and more resistant to chemical, 
physical and biological degradation, they have many functional 
usages (5). However, this very resistance ( 6) has led to massive 
accumulation of plastics. Micro- and nano-sized plastic parti-
cles have spread in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems causing 
widespread health concerns (7).
Plastic waste is now a global concern, and much research 
is being done on potential routes of remediation. Using micro-
bial or enzymatic degradation of plastics is a promising method 
to depolymerize waste plastics into virgin monomers to recy-
cle or upconvert them ( 8). The degradation occurs by enzymes 
present in or secreted by microbial cells. Low crystalline and some 
low-density polymers of polyethylene terephthalate, (PET), ester-
based PUR and oligomers of PA are biodegradable by hydrolases 
(9). The enzymatic degradation occurs in two stages: adsorp-
tion of enzymes on the polymer surface, followed by hydro-
peroxidation/hydrolysis of the bonds (10). This is typically done 
extracellularly. They facilitate the addition of a water molecule 
to the polymer chain, resulting in the cleavage of the carbon 
bond and then formation of smaller fragments (11). Then, smaller 
subunits can be assimilated into the microbial cell for further 
enzymatic degradation and then release metabolic products like 
CO2, H2O, CH4 and N2 (12). More than 90 microorganisms like bac-
teria and fungi can degrade petroleum-based plastics (13); these 
have been isolated from soil, sea water, activated sludge, etc. and 
hydrolyze different polymers ( 14). Metagenomic DNA from bio-
corrosion films can be sequenced to provide a large database of 
putative enzymes. However, one limitation to the field is rapidly 
prototyping these putative enzymes and obtaining experimental 
sequence to function data.
Cell-free expression (CFE) is an established tool for rapid pro-
tein prototyping, with applications in metabolic engineering, ther-
apeutic development and sensor design (15, 16). Briefly, CFE uses 
extracted biomolecular machinery to produce proteins without 
using living cells. Cell extracts are used that contain essential 
transcription–translation machinery; the extract is also supple-
mented to further extend reaction time. DNA templates are added 
to the extract and the expression proceeds in vitro (17). One limi-
tation of CFE is the inherent variability in experimental replicates 
(18), which can be partially mitigated through improved extract 
and supplement preparation and improved manual handling of 
small volumes (19).
Automation of CFE can further improve consistency. As exam-
ples, a BRAVO liquid-handling robot (Agilent Technologies) was 
used to map physiochemical landscapes to maximize biosynthesis 
yields (20). The Echo 525 Acoustic Liquid Handler (Beckman Coul-
ter Life Sciences, San Jose, CA) has been used to further reduce 
sample volume and increase throughput ( 21) and to explore reg-
ulatory mechanisms for T7 RNAP-driven expression; a rapid and 
cost-effective method was developed to characterize engineered 
T7-based transcription factors using cell-free protein synthesis 
and the liquid handler ( 22). Although small-volume, acoustic-
based liquid handlers (e.g. Echo) are becoming more prevalent in 
the field, they are not well-equipped to produce 10–100 μL reac-
tions that are necessary, in some cases, to produce enough protein 
for functional analysis. Moreover, the cost point of these liq-
uid handlers is prohibitive to many users. Here, we demonstrate 
the use of a low-cost, automated pipettor (Opentrons, OT-2) to 
overcome these limitations and screen plastic degrading enzymes.
In this work, putative hydrolases were mined from genomic 
data of microbes found to grow on aircraft and trucks ( 23–25) 
(Figure 1). The target substrate in this case is polyester 
polyurethane which is used as a topcoat finish for interior use 
on high performance aircraft. A panel of 13 unique enzymes 
was identified for testing on polyester degradation activity using 
current bioinformatic workflows. These enzymes were expressed 
using semi-automated CFE and tested with chromogenic probes 
(nitrophenyl substrates) to rank order the polyester degrading 
ability of each sequence, per reaction volume. We then discuss 
limitations of this approach and advances necessary to make it a 
more relevant screening method.
2. Materials and methods
2.1 Genomic assessment
As described in more detail (24, 25), microbial communities resid-
ing on polymer-coated interior surfaces of military aircraft and 
trucks were sourced and sequenced. These communities con-
sisted of fungi and bacteria and were collected to characterize 
microbial degradation of polymers. Metagenomic assemblies were 
classified into eukaryotic and prokaryotic contigs using EukRep 
(26), and then eukaryotic open reading frames (ORFs) were pre-
dicted with MetaEuk ( 27) and prokaryotic ORFs were predicted 
using Prokka (28). Using a combination of sequence identifi-
cation tools (BLAST (29), HMM (30) and DeepGOPlus ( 31)) and 
alpha/beta fold hydrolase-specific reference databases (ESTER (32) 
and Lipase Engineering Database (33)), we identified putative 
hydrolases ( Figure 2). A subset of 13 hydrolases that included 
several cutinases (known to degrade polyesters ( 34)) and other 
polymer substrates, as well as representatives from both fungal 
and bacterial species, were selected for testing on the automated 
CFE platform (see Supplement 1 for sequences).
2.2 Opentrons accuracy and precision 
measurements
Fluid handling accuracy experiments were conducted by adding 
1 μL water (at room temperature) and assessing level of replicate 
variance through mass measurement. The mass of an empty PCR 
tube was measured, 1μL water was added with Opentrons, and the 
final mass was measured. The same operations were performed 
nine independent times using the same tip as well as with chang-
ing the tip at each step. To measure precision of automated CFE 
reaction preparation from same stock tubes of reagents, 1μL of dye 
(food coloring) was added to 14 μL of water at room temperature. 
In total, 48 readings were taken using the same tip and changed

tip at each step and they were done both manually and with the 
OT-2. The absorbance of each well was then measured using Syn-
ergy Neo2 HTS Multi-Mode Microplate Reader (BioTek) at 420 nm. 
Statistical assessment of variance was done with a two-sample F 
test. An F test can determine if the variance of one population is 
significantly different from variance of another and determine the 
associated P-value (35).
2.3 CFE reactions
In the CFE reactions, four components are added: cell extract, 
supplement mix, DNA template and water (Figure 3c). These 
components were added to the reaction well plate manually 
or with an automatic fluid handler (OT-2). For our experiment, 
we used E. coli (BL21 DE3 star) cell extract, PANOx-SP system 
as supplement (with 57 mM HEPES buffer of pH 7, 1.2 mM ATP, 
0.85 mM GMP, 0.85 mM CMP, 0.85 mM UMP, 33 mM PEP, 34 μg/ml 
folinic acid, 171 μg/ml E. coli tRNA, 2 mM 20 amino acids, 0.33 mM 
NAD, 0.26 mM CoA, 175 mM potassium glutamate, 10 mM ammo-
nium glutamate, 16 mM magnesium glutamate, 2.7 mM potas-
sium oxalate, 1 mM putrescine, 1.5 mM spermidine) and a linear 
DNA template at 5 nM ( 36). The cell extract was produced fol-
lowing the methodology outlined in our lab’s prior publication on 
scalable extract (19). A 96 clear well plate (Corning® 96 Well White 
PS microplate) was used to contain the reactions. Each well con-
tained 30μL of reaction solution composed of 10μL of supplement 
mix, 7.2 μL of cell extract (Bl21 DE3 star), 5 nM of linear template 
and balance of volume as water. In the control experiments, the 
components were 10 μL of supplement mix, 7.2 μL of cell extract 
(Bl21 DE3 star) and 12.8 μL of water. The DNA sequences of the 
enzymes were obtained using the IDT codon optimization tool for 
E. coli. Integrated DNA Technologies (IDT) provided the software 
IDT Codon Optimization Tool to facilitate the optimization of DNA 
sequences for enhanced protein expression in various host organ-
isms. Using the tool, the researchers can design synthetic DNA 
sequences that are adapted to the preferred codon usage of the 
target organism, alleviating issues related to codon bias, tRNA 
availability, mRNA stability, which can substantially increase pro-
tein production levels (37, 38). The enzyme sequence was inserted 
into the protein sequence location of our minimal expression tem-
plate with primer binding sites, restriction enzyme sites, a T7 
promoter, a ribosome bindingsite, a start codon, T7 terminator and 
was ordered from IDT as a complete gene block. After receiving the 
gene fragment, it was suspended and went through traditional lin-
ear amplification using OneTaq kit. Protocols supplied by OneTaq 
were followed for the amplification. The resulting linear tem-
plate (LET) was then purified using Zymo purification kit (D4004) 
and eluted in 50 μl of water. The concentration was determined 
via 260/280 nm absorbance measurements with a Synergy NEO2 
multimode reader (BioTek, Winooski, VT) (39, 40) (all sequences 
used in this study are available in Supplement 1). In the auto-
mated experiments, master vials of extract, supplement mix and 
DNA were used to construct five independent replicates. Here, 
the reagents were transferred and mixed by pipette of OT-2. The 
reagents were held at 4 ∘C to reduce the deterioration of quality 
of the reagents during setup using the OT-2 temperature mod-
ule. In manual experiments, five replicates were also prepared 
for each sample to account for the biological variability encoun-
tered in CFE experiments. After mixing the components, the wells 
were surrounded by water and the plate was covered to avoid dry-
ing ( 40). The plate was monitored in a plate reader for 16 h at 
30∘C with orbital shaking to measure dynamic expression of the 
protein. This experiment was done to measure variance in pro-
duction of a model protein, superfolder green fluorescent protein 
(sfGFP) by automated versus manual reaction preparation. For the 
nitrophenyl testing with 13 putative enzyme experiments, the CFE 
reaction was run for 5 h at 30 ∘C on a thermomixer block. After 
the CFE reaction was complete, the samples were tested with 
nitrophenyl probes as described next.

2.4 Nitrophenyl probe experiments
The completed CFE reactions containing enzyme were ini-
tially tested with 4-nitrophenyl hexanoate (4-NPH), a colorigenic 
esterase probe demonstrated in literature (41). The cleavage of the 
p-nitrophenyl ester (42) releases the product, 4-NP (4-nitrophenol) 
and imparts a bright yellow color to the solution, which can 
be measured at 405 nm (42, 43). To prepare the colorogenic 
substrates, a stock solution of 2.5 mM 4-nitrophenyl hexanoate 
(4NPH) was made in dimethylformamide (DMF) prior to use (light 
sensitive reagent) (41). After the CFE reaction was complete and 
maintained at 25∘C, 70μL of phosphate buffered saline (1× PBS; pH 
8.0) was added to the reaction well to maintain constant pH dur-
ing the assay, which is critical for enzyme activity measurements 
(44); this also diluted the sample and reduced background effect of 
CFE reagents interacting with the nitrophenyl probe. Then, 10μL of 
2.5 mM of 4NPH was added to the wells of expressed enzyme (final 
probe concentration = 0.227 mM). The substrate was added using 
an automated dispenser included in the plate reader. The change 
in absorbance was measured after 1 min of adding the probe as 
the cleaving activity of the ester was observed to happen quickly 
and this reduced background effect of CFE components interact-
ing with the probe, which was observed in longer incubation times 
(15 and 30 min) with sfGFP control reactions (Supplement 7).
The change in absorbance at 405 nm was observed with 
the spectral scan option in the Synergy Neo2 HTS Multi-
Mode Microplate Reader (BioTek). This procedure was con-
ducted with the full panel of putative enzymes against four 
nitrophenyl substrates with varying carbon chain lengths: 4-
nitrophenyl hexanoate (4NPH), 4-nitrophenyl palmitate (4NPP), 
4-nitrophenyl valerate (4NPV) and 4-nitrophenyl dodecanoate 
(4NPD). As a control, wells expressing sfGFP in CFE were tested 
with the nitrophenyl substrates to check for any nonselec-
tive activity from the CFE components (and to cross validate 
that the expression conditions were good by measuring sfGFP
fluorescence).
3. Results and discussions
Prior to using CFE for screening a panel of enzymes, we eval-
uated the accuracy, precision and throughput advantages of a 
low-cost, automated fluid handler (OT-2), relative to manual reac-
tion assembly, especially with regard to low volume handling. 
The typical lower volume limit manual addition in a CFE screen-
ing experiment is 1 μL, and thus performance is assessed at that 
level. First, accuracy and level of variance were compared between 
manual and automated dispensing of 1 μL water and comparing 
to expected mass (Figure 3a). This experiment showed that auto-
mated addition with changed tip between each deposit had closest 
to expected with average of 0.92 mg (as measured on our balance) 
and tightest variance with standard deviation of ± 0.021 mg and 
root mean squared error of 0.085 mg; this is better than all other 
tested protocols including automated pipetting with the same tip. 
T wo sample F tests between the automated, change-tip method 
and other methods show a statistically significant decrease in vari-
ance. The inaccuracy and variability of the methods that keep the 
same tip on the OT-2 machine is likely due to variable effects 
of loading a wetted surface area on repeated use runs. Manual 
addition has bigger variability likely due to more difficult pipet-
ting technique at such low volumes. When the same tip is used 
between runs, there is always a certain amount of remaining water 
inside the tip that causes a difference in pulled liquid volume 
in the next run because of the change in surface tension. Also,

manual pipetting occurs at variable angles and insertion depths 
causing more variation than automated methods which do not 
have this limitation.
Next, precision of the automated versus manual additions was 
compared using 1 μL dye additions to different wells with and 
without changing the tip, measuring the absorbance caused by the 
dye, and then assessing variance (Figure 3b). It was observed that 
the automated dye addition using the changed tip is more precise 
than the other readings (lowest standard deviation) and variance 
is significantly lower than the other manual methods (based on F-
test, see Figure 3b, also Supplement 5). Based on results of the 
accuracy and precision tests, we established an OT-2 protocol 
using Opentrons Protocol Designer BETA software for assembling 
a CFE reaction (45).
Next, we evaluated reproducibility of CFE reactions with 
automation provided by the OT-2. The same source of reagents 
was used for both manual and automated CFE reactions, and 
expression progress was tracked using fluorescence of sfGFP 
(Figure 3d, n = 5). Reactions were also tested as ‘only trans-
ferred’ (no pipette mixing to reduce tip consumption) as well 
as ‘transferred and mixed’ via pipetting. The end point yield 
(Figure 3e) and initial production rate at first 2.5 h of the reac-
tion (Figure 3f) were measured. Variation in response is reduced 
with mixing for both automated and manual additions. Auto-
mated addition with mixing has higher GFP production rate 
(1.96 μg/ml/min) with less deviation (±0.08 μg/ml/min). Moreover, 
the automated additions showed higher protein yield than man-
ual additions (per end point fluorescence, Supplement 2). An 
F-test on the results also shows that the automated addition with 
mixing variance is significantly lower than the manual opera-
tions. To quantify the amount of sfGFP that was produced, an 
sfGFP RFU to mass concentration calibration curve was used
(Supplement 2) (19). 
These data show that the low-cost, automated fluid han-
dler has less variability than manual operation. It is noted that 
this is not an exhaustive study and that the manual operation 
could be improved by screening other users or pipettes; however, 
screening campaigns would be limited by user to user variabil-
ity. These data also show that CFE variability is reduced when 
reagents are mixed by the pipette after transferring to the well 
plate. Automation also has clear advantages in larger, full well 
plate campaigns where automation can improve errors caused 
by pipetting fatigue and user error; tracking specific volumes of

reagents to particular wells can be difficult across a full plate 
with a high chance of adding no reagent or adding more than 
once to a well. Thus, for the putative hydrolase enzyme testing 
that follows, the automated method with mixing was used for all
experiments.

control and each sample mean is computed with two sample T-test, indicating P-value with stars (P < 0.05, (*), P < 0.01, (**), P < 0.001, (***)).
3.1 Prototyping hydrolase enzymes in cell-free 
reactions
To first demonstrate that CFE can produce hydrolases that have 
measurable esterase activity, we used CFE to produce a cutinase 
(Papiliotrema laurentii) with known esterase activity ( 46) (see Sup-
plement 1 for sequence). The initial experiments revealed much 
background activity of the cell lysate on the nitrophenyl probe, 
a common problem with absorbance-based assays. Thus, to limit 
the effect of background activity, we diluted the completed extract 
with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) up to 100 μL, added 10 μL 4-
NPH at concentration of 2.5 mM (final concentration = 0.227 mM) 
using an automated dispenser attached with the plate reader, 
and then monitored change in absorbance. By screening the plate 
after adding the probe (incubation of 1 min), we found signifi-
cant cleavage from the CFE reactions that produced this cutinase, 
from templates with and without a secretion tag (at 405 nm peak, 
Figure 4a) as compared to lysate that had no template (negative 
control).
Next, a panel of four nitrophenyl ester substrates (Table 1) 
was tested against this cutinase and benchmarked against a CFE 
control reaction that produced sfGFP to test reproducibility and 
selectivity. The change in absorbance was measured at 405 nm 
after 1 min incubation with the probe (ΔAbs405nm, Figure 4b). Some 
background activity from the sfGFP extract is observed, but the 
change in absorbance caused by the enzyme containing samples 
is higher than sfGFP. It is also observed that the shorter sub-
strates (4NPV and 4NPH) are more readily cleaved by cutinase 
than the longer 4NPD and 4NPP. This likely has to do with the 
accessibility of the enzyme active site to these substrate prox-
ies; if the substrate side chain is too large, it will not fit the
catalytic site (47, 48).
The 4NPV and 4NPH probes were then used to test the full panel 
of 13 enzymes identified by metagenome analysis (Supplement 3). 
Enzymes 1–10 showed significant cleavage (at 405 nm peak) com-
pared to sfGFP control for both substrates (P-values tabulated in 
Supplement 6 and indicated in Figure 5). The positive control cuti-
nase showed maximum signal change for both substrates. The 
enzymes can show different results at Nitrophenyl test based on 
substrate; as example, enzyme 8 (Putative Coesterase—Hortaea 
werneckii (Fungi)) is one of the top performers with 4NPH but is 
ranked eighth with 4NPV . This demonstrates the impact proxy 
substrates may have in screening efforts, leading to promotion of 
sequences that might show activity with a given proxy and not 
to the actual, target substrate. To improve quality of screening 
results, probes that can operate in small-volume, turbid cell-free 
reactions with the actual target substrate should be identified, 
such as recently developed polymer and fluorescent nanoparticle 
conjugates (49).
Another apparent limitation of this direct screening approach 
is the inherent biological variability present in CFE reactions, 
observed in the varied response levels for a given enzyme type 
(Figure 5). Even with automated CFE assembly, the amount of 
enzyme expressed can vary and there is inherent variability in the 
nitrophenyl assays (42, 43) which are very sensitive to dispensed 
volume and timing. This emphasizes the importance of running 
sufficient replicates with each test. One method to overcome vari-
ability is to express sufficient target enzyme with purification tag 
and run parallelized separation and purification; however, this 
comes at cost and increased time.
The approach of CFE-based screening is fast relative to tra-
ditional methods of heterologous expression, purification and 
testing with nitrophenyl substrates or other activity assays. CFE 
prototyping is a useful tool to identify which sequences from a 
library exhibit target activity; however, the relative ranking should 
not be assumed as absolute truth. Follow-on, kinetic studies of top 
candidates should still be performed. Not only is relative rank-
ing affected by proxy substrate size, as noted above, but there are 
also differences in template expression. Even though the same 
amount of DNA template is added to each reaction (5 nM), this 
does not mean that the same number of active enzymes are pro-
duced. This is highly dependent on length and composition of 
sequence leading to different translational efficiencies ( 50–52). 
Uniform expression across a pool of genetic templates has yet to 
be demonstrated with CFE and is one limitation for rapid prototyp-
ing and screening by CFE. Convenient methods to directly quantify 
the amount of protein being functionally assessed should like-
wise be developed. Other limitations of this approach include the 
low level of enzyme production that precludes testing on larger 
polymer films.
4. Conclusion
Herein, we have validated that CFE coupled with an effective 
reporter probe can be used to provide relative functional infor-
mation for a panel of bio-prospected, putative enzymes. This 
A. Ahsan et al.  7
is useful for investigators trying to isolate top candidates for 
deeper study from a large genomic library. In this case, small 
molecular weight nitrophenyl probes, 4-nitrophenyl valerate and 
4-nitrophenyl hexanoate, were found to work directly in diluted 
CFE reactions in detecting esterase activity. Although these are 
convenient substrate proxies to polyurethane polyesters, they do 
not capture the complexity of the actual polyurethane substrate 
and efforts should continue to develop convenient solution phase, 
optical reporting probes that transduce actual polymer degrada-
tion. Such a probe could be developed from suspending optical 
nanoparticles in polymer substrate (53) and testing as a colloidal 
solution or on a porous solid surface. This approach could also 
solve the inherent limitation of low enzyme yield from small CFE 
reactions that precludes testing on larger polymer fragments and 
films. Additionally, continued progress should be made on stan-
dardizing CFE reagents and template design such that there are 
similar translational efficiencies across all expressed products and 
less variation between replicates. Methods to rapidly measure titer 
of correctly folded enzymes in the CFE reaction will also help 
normalize enzyme activity measurements. Notwithstanding these 
current limitations, automated CFE is a versatile tool to help pro-
vide much needed sequence to function data for enzymes. Such 
standardized data sets can then be used to train machine learning 
based tools for de novo enzyme design.
