Abstract
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is a very valuable and beneficial material for industrial purposes, with various different 
applications. Due to the high annual production volume of over 50 million tons worldwide and the indiscriminate disposal 
by consumers, the polymers accumulate in the environment, causing negative effects on various ecosystems. Biodegradation 
via suitable enzymes represents a promising approach to combat the plastic waste issue so validated methods are required 
to measure the efficiency and efficacy of these enzymes. PETase and MHETase from Ideonella sakaiensis are suitable 
enzymes needed in combination to completely degrade PET into its environmentally friendly monomers. In this project, 
we compare and combine a previously described bulk absorbance measurement method with a newly established 1H NMR 
analysis method of the PET degradation products mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid, bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic 
acid and terephthalic acid. Both were optimized regarding different solvents, pH values and drying processes. The accuracy 
of the measurements can be confirmed with sensitivity limits of 2.5–5 µM for the absorption method and 5–10 µM for the 1H 
NMR analysis. The combination of the described methods therefore allows a quantitative analysis by using bulk absorption 
coupled with a qualitative analysis through 1H NMR. The methods established in our work can potentially contribute to the 
development of suitable recycling strategies of PET using recombinant enzymes.

Introduction
The background to the objective is the plastic waste problem 
in the environment and the potential solution of biodegrad-
ing the polymers by plastic-degrading enzymes. In this work, 
the focus is on the plastic poly(ethylene terephthalate) and 
on the measurements of its degradation products produced 
by biodegradation via PETase und MHETase.
Biodegradation of poly(ethylene terephthalate)
PET is one of the most abundant plastics worldwide with a 
global production volume of over 50 million tons per year 
(Dissanayake and Jayakody 2021). PET is mainly used to 
produce beverage bottles, films and polyester textiles. Its 
durability and high resistance to natural degradation are a 
major drawback for recycling processes, making them very 
costly and energy intensive. Plastic waste accumulates in the 
environment due to poor waste treatment and poses a major 
threat to various ecosystems (Law et al. 2020). As plastics

accumulate, microorganisms adapt and develop enzymes to 
break down the manmade plastics and use some of them as 
sources of carbon and energy (Austin et al. 2018). Biodeg-
radation by optimized enzymes may be a solution to combat 
the plastic waste problem. PET, for example, has a glass 
transition temperature above 70 °C, at which the polymer 
becomes more amenable to enzymatic attack, thus ensuring 
more efficient degradation at a correspondingly high reac-
tion temperature. Consequently, the optimization of enzymes 
through protein engineering of the amino acid residues 
involved in the thermostabilization of polyester hydrolases 
represents a potential approach for industrial PET recycling 
processes. (Wei and Zimmermann 2017a).
In principle, many microorganisms are associated with 
the biodegradation of plastics, but most enzymes involved 
have not yet been identified. Therefore, the aim of research is 
to identify, isolate, synthesize and optimize plastic-degrad-
ing enzymes. PET hydrolases represent the largest fraction 
of the enzymes studied. Involved are serine hydrolases with 
a typical α/β-hydrolase fold and a catalytic triad of the amino 
acids serine, histidine and aspartic acid (Wei et al. 2014).
PETase and MHETase from Ideonella sakaiensis
To date, the main known plastic-degrading enzymes are 
responsible for the biodegradation of polyurethan, such as 
PueB lipase and PueA lipase from Pseudomonas chlorora-
phis, and for the degradation of poly(ethylene terephthalate), 
for example, by CalB lipase from Candida antarctica (Danso 
et al. 2019). In addition to enzymes from Candida antarc-
tica, other hydrolases are known for PET degradation, such 
as enzymes from the genera Thermobifida, Thermomono-
spora, Ideonella sakaiensis , Bacillus, and Saccharomono-
spora (Wei and Zimmermann 2017b). The turnover rates 
of all known hydrolases are relatively low. For example, an 
enzyme from the bacterium Thermobifida fusca has an ero-
sion rate of approximately 8–17 µm PET per week when 
incubated at 55 °C (Müller et al. 2005). Validated methods 
are required to measure the efficacy and efficiency of the 
enzymes for future optimization strategies.
In 2016, Japanese researchers discovered the bacte-
rium Ideonella sakaiensis in the sediment of a PET bottle 
recycling plant. Ideonella can use PET as its main carbon 
and energy source of growth. I. sakaiensis produces two 
enzymes that are required in combination to completely 
degrade PET into its environmentally compatible monomers. 
The first enzyme PETase (EC 3.1.1.101) degrades PET into 
mono(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalic acid (MHET) with minor 
amounts of terephthalic acid (TPA) and bis(2-hydroxyethyl) 
terephthalic acid (BHET). MHET is subsequently hydro-
lysed by the second enzyme MHETase (EC 3.1.1.102) into 
the monomers TPA and ethylene glycol (EG). Depending 
on the substrate, the optimal conditions are pH 7–9 and a 
temperature between 30 °C and 40 °C (Yoshida et al. 2016).
Genetic approach to optimize PETase from Ideonella 
sakaiensis
One of the most effective and promising enzymes for the 
biodegradation of PET is the enzyme PETase. PETase 
from I. sakaiensis showed up to 120 times higher activity 
against PET films than previously tested PET-degrading 
enzymes. Depending on the substrate, the optimal condi-
tions are pH 7–9 and a temperature between 30 °C and 40 °C 
(Yoshida et al. 2016). Ever since the discovery, research is 
focused on improving its thermostability, activity and effi-
ciency. For example, the research group led by Ma et al. 
focused on the development and investigation of new highly 
efficient PETase mutants created by protein engineering of 
key hydrophobic sites, resulting in 2.5-fold higher PET deg-
radation activity at 30 °C compared with wild-type PETase 
(Ma et al. 2018). The team of Son et al. was able to develop, 
also by protein engineering, a PETase variant with increased 
thermostability, which showed a 14-fold higher degradation 
activity at 40 °C compared to the wild-type PETase (Son 
et al. 2019). In addition, the secretion of PETase has already 
been improved by further development of the pelB signal 
peptide by random mutagenesis and screening, resulting in 
a 1.7-fold increase in PETase secretion, leading to more effi-
cient hydrolysis of PET (Shi et al. 2021). The immobiliza-
tion of the enzymes involved represents a further optimiza-
tion opportunity regarding biodegradation.
Analytics for biodegradation
Validated methods are required to study enzymes in terms of 
their efficiency and efficacy. There are already some standard 
methods that can be used to evaluate degradation. Visual 
observation using a scanning electron microscope (Yoshida 
et al. 2016) or similar technique provides a simple method to 
observe surface roughness, colour changes and the formation 
of cracks or biofilms on the surface (Moog et al. 2019). The 
loss of substrate mass can also be used for initial degrada-
tion analysis. Other analytical methods include changes in 
mechanical properties and molecular masses (Torena et al. 
2021),  CO2 formation and  O2 consumption (Torena et al. 
2021; Yoshida et al. 2016), enzymatic degradation (Zhong-
Johnson et al. 2021), fluorescence detection methods (Wei 
et al. 2012) and the so-called clear zone test, which is typi-
cally used to screen for organisms capable of degrading a 
particular polymer (Torena et al. 2021). This study has a 
focus on enzymatic degradation.
The degradation products of plastic need to be analysed to 
determine the activity of the enzymes involved and to be able 
to develop suitable recycling and bioremediation strategies. 
20691Environmental Science and Pollution Research (2024) 31:20689–20697 
We focused on the plastic PET and its degradation products 
MHET, BHET and TPA for the measurements. Currently, 
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is the 
most established and used method for the determination of 
PET degradation products, which was used, for example, 
by scientists such as Yoshida et al. (2016), Joo et al. (2018) 
and Oda et al. (2018) in their experiments. HPLC is a rapid, 
highly accurate and automated method for analysing samples 
for their chemical components, and it is highly reproducible. 
However, the method can be very expensive due to the large 
quantities of organics required and the different columns and 
modules. In addition, coelution can occur if two components 
are similar in structure and polarity, which is the case in 
PET degradation products, and thus elute simultaneously or 
almost simultaneously (Wang et al. 2021).
We evaluate a newly established 1H NMR analysis method 
as a suitable analysis method for qualification. We selected 
1H NMR analysis, because this method is quite new regard-
ing PET degradation products and can be performed with lit-
tle effort. Furthermore, 1H NMR is a powerful and essential 
analytical tool to elucidate the structure of unknown natural 
and synthetic compounds resulting from the degradation of 
PET with respect to hydrogen-1 nuclei within the molecules 
(Wang et al. 2021). Since PETase degrades PET into TPA, 
MHET and BHET, it is necessary to detect the amount of the 
intermediate MHET to make a specification for MHETase, 
which subsequently catalyses the degradation of MHET into 
the monomers TPA and EG. To be able to make a statement 
about the quantity in addition to the qualification, we used 
an already described simple and rapid method that is also 
resource-efficient and can be performed with a low sample 
volume (Zhong-Johnson et al. 2021). Because this method 
is a bulk absorbance measurement with contributions of all 
degradation products to the absorbance due to the presence 
of the aromatic ring of TPA, MHET and BHET, it is not pos-
sible to distinguish between these products. This combined 
absorbance/1H NMR method has the great advantage that a 
qualitative and quantitative measurement can be carried out 
simultaneously with minimal sample preparation. Another 
advantage is the ease of performance and the low sample 
volume and time required, mainly with regard to the bulk 
absorbance method.
Immobilization of PETase
The use of free enzymes, such as PETase, has been a chal-
lenge so far due to the complex purification processes, short 
life span and non-reusability. Immobilization of the enzymes 
can overcome these limitations. In the work of Zhu et al., a 
possible application of immobilized PETase for PET degra-
dation in wastewater is described with subsequent endpoint 
HPLC measurement of the degradation products (Zhu et al. 
2022). The innovative biofilm integrated nanofiber display 
(BIND) platform enables protein immobilization onto the 
curli of Escherichia coli, where the target enzyme binds with 
the CsgA subunit, the building block monomer of curli (Zhu 
et al. 2022). Consequently, in protein purification, prepara-
tion of the carrier material is not required, and the possible 
limitation of enzyme functionality due to physical or chemi-
cal binding is circumvented. A renewable PET-degrading 
biocatalyst has already been developed for plastic degrada-
tion, in which the PETase was functionally immobilized on 
the E. coli curli nanofibers, called BIND-PETase. In addi-
tion to different reaction conditions and testing regarding the 
storage stability and reusability of the biocatalyst, the appli-
cation scenario investigated included the degradation of PET 
in a complex wastewater matrix with subsequent HPLC anal-
ysis. A concentration of over 4300 µM of the degradation 
products was measured after 15 days of reaction. Accord-
ingly, BIND-PETase could contribute to the development 
of a biocatalytic strategy for advanced wastewater treatment 
and thus to the reduction of microplastic pollution (Zhu et al. 
2022). By analysis with the combined absorbance/1H NMR 
method using flow cells for bulk absorbance and sampling at 
different times for 1H NMR, continuous monitoring of such 
a wastewater treatment could be achieved, allowing further 
conclusions on the kinetic stability of the PETase and on the 
product distribution in the wastewater.
Material and methods
Chemicals and reagents were purchased from Tokyo Chemi-
cal Industry, Carl Roth, Deutero GmbH, and Sigma Aldrich 
and were used without further purification. Two different 
methods were performed to allow a combined qualitative 
and quantitative measurement of the degradation products 
TPA, MHET and BHET. In both methods, degradation prod-
ucts were dissolved in buffers with different pH values as 
well as in pure DMSO and measured in combination with 
heat drying, freeze drying and without drying.
General procedure for NMR measurements
This method only involves the qualification of TPA, MHET 
and BHET. The individual degradation products were iden-
tified by 1H NMR measurements on a Spinsolve 60 Car -
bon Benchtop NMR spectrometer (Magritek). Chemical 
shift values are reported in ppm and are used as a reference 
depending on solvent, temperature and magnetic field. The 
spectra were recorded at room temperature with the 1D Pro-
ton + protocol using 8192 scans with a 90° excitation pulse 
(7 μs) covering a spectral range from 45 to − 36 ppm. A 
total of 32,000 data points is acquired with an acquisition 
time of 6.4 s and a repetition time of 7 s. The measurements 
took about 16 h. Data processing has been performed with 
20692 Environmental Science and Pollution Research (2024) 31:20689–20697
MestReNova version 14.2.2-28739, including zeroth and 
first-order phase correction and baseline correction with a 
Bernstein polynomial fit of third order.
General procedure for bulk absorbance 
measurements
To quantify the total products without differentiating 
between the individual degradation products, bulk absorb-
ance was measured in 1-cm-gap UV-transparent glass 
cuvettes using a spectrophotometer with a 1 mL sample 
volume. Due to the presence of the aromatic ring, absorb-
ance measurements were typically performed between 240 
and 260 nm. For our study, the detection wavelength of 
260 nm was selected, because during sample preparation, 
the degradation products are dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide 
(DMSO), which absorbs strongly between 220 and 250 nm. 
Before quantifying the total products, a zero adjustment was 
carried out with the solvent DMSO. For each degradation 
product, a linear absorption profile was established with a 
concentration range of 100–1 µM. Duplicate determinations 
were made for each concentration.
Preparation of samples
For the establishment of the linear absorption profiles, the 
individual degradation products were dissolved in a buffer 
with two different pH values (pH 9 and pH 3.54) as well as 
in pure DMSO to determine the optimal conditions. The 
value of 3.54 corresponds to the pKs of TPA. We used a 
50 mM glycine–NaOH buffer containing 50 mM NaCl and 
10% (v/v) DMSO. DMSO was added to solubilize the prod-
ucts. A final product concentration of 500 µM was obtained 
in each case. To further optimize the parameters, heat drying 
was compared with freeze drying. After drying, the degrada-
tion products were taken up into DMSO. A dilution series 
was prepared with the concentrations of 100, 75, 50, 25, 
10, 7.5, 5, 2.5, and 1 µM. The samples were then analysed 
qualitatively by 1H NMR and quantitatively by bulk absorb-
ance at 260 nm. In addition, a mixture of MHET, BHET 
and TPA with 500 µM each in buffer without drying was 
examined to verify the differentiation of the products by 
1H NMR analysis.
Results
The aim of the work was to establish a new 1H NMR analysis 
method and optimize it, as well as to optimize the absorption 
method already described for the measurement of PET deg-
radation products. The methods were compared and linked 
to establish a new combined absorption/1H NMR method for 
the quantitative and at the same time qualitative determina-
tion of the products.
Suitability check of the 1H NMR analysis
To verify the suitability of the 1H NMR method, a mixture 
of 500 µM of each of the degradation products was first pre-
pared in a 50 mM glycine–NaOH buffer containing 50 mM 
NaCl and 10% (v/v) DMSO with pH 9 and measured to 
check whether it was possible to distinguish the products. 
In contrast to the other measurements with 8192 scans, this 
measurement was performed with only 40 scans since the 
concentration of 500 µM was quite high and thus easier to 
detect. Consequently, the measurement took only 10 min 
instead of 16 h. Figure  1 shows the corresponding NMR 
spectrum with the molecular structures of the products. Two 
singlets and one doublet can be detected between 8.05 and 
7.60 ppm in the aromatic range. The first singlet at 7.66 ppm 
belongs to the aromatic protons of TPA. The main degrada-
tion product MHET shows a doublet at 7.77 and 7.85 ppm 
because the aromatic is no longer symmetrical. The second 
singlet at 7.97 ppm indicates BHET. The three products 
could be clearly distinguished from each other by different 
aromatic signals, and thus qualitative analysis by 1H NMR 
is confirmed as possible.
Optimization of the measurement conditions
Different pH values, drying methods and solutions were 
tested to establish the optimal conditions for the 1H NMR 
and absorption measurement and to determine the sensitiv -
ity. Since the products are insoluble or sparingly soluble in 
aqueous solutions and therefore difficult to measure with 
1H NMR as well as with bulk absorption at lower concentra-
tions, the samples were dried to subsequently dissolve them 
in a suitable solvent. Both freeze-drying and heat-drying 
were carried out for this purpose. During drying, TPA crys-
tallized out due to the pH of the buffer being too high at pH 
9 and thus could not or only barely be measured. Therefore, 
the buffer was acidified to the pKs of TPA (pH 3.54) with 
1 M HCl before drying. After drying, the products were 
taken up in the solvent DMSO; the dilution series was pre-
pared and then analysed by 1H NMR and bulk absorption 
measurement. An overview of the optimization of the param-
eters can be found in Fig. 2. The corresponding experimental 
data of the optimization tests regarding different solvents, 
pH values and drying processes can be found in the sup-
plementary material. The clearest spectra of the degradation 
products and thus the highest sensitivity could be detected 
directly in DMSO without drying, so even concentrations 
of 1 µM were not a problem. Moreover, the absorbance val-
ues were much higher compared to the measurements of 
the products in buffer. However, this method will be used 
20693Environmental Science and Pollution Research (2024) 31:20689–20697 
in the future for the detection of the enzymatic activity of 
PETase and MHETase as well as PETase homologs, so the 
reaction buffer proved to be indispensable. The spectrum of 
the lowest concentration of MHET could be determined with 
the freeze-drying procedure, with no differences between 
the two pH values. BHET showed the best result at pH 9 
in combination with freeze-drying. Since TPA crystallized 
at pH 9 and could not be measured by either method, the 
optimum conditions for this product could be determined to 
be pH 3.54 in combination with freeze-drying or heat-dry -
ing. In general, both drying methods showed little difference, 
yet each method has its advantages and disadvantages. While 
freeze-drying requires more materials such as nitrogen and is 
therefore more expensive, heat-drying requires considerably 
more time and could possibly destroy components, which 
was not the case with PET, however. Also, the pH values

The degradation products could 
be clearly distinguished from 
each other

ments. Different solvents, pH values and drying processes were inves-
tigated to determine the optimum conditions for the measurement of 
the degradation products, shown in coloured lines. The best results 
for TPA and MHET were achieved in buffer pH 3.54 after freeze-dry-
ing. For MHET, equal sensitivity was demonstrated in buffer pH  9. 
The optimal conditions for BHET were at pH 9 in combination with 
freeze-drying. Nevertheless, sensitivity was also very high in buffer 
pH 3.54 combined with freeze-drying, so that these conditions proved 
to be the most suitable
20694 Environmental Science and Pollution Research (2024) 31:20689–20697
did not show much difference for MHET and BHET, but for 
TPA, only pH 3.54 could be used. Since TPA constitutes an 
important part of the degradation products, the optimal con-
ditions for the measurement of the mixture were the buffer 
with pH 3.54 in combination with freeze or heat drying, as 
the sensitivity was very high for the 3 products in this case. 
The absorption measurement also provided the best results 
under these conditions.
Sensitivity limits for the combined absorption/1H 
NMR method
Bulk absorbance measurements were carried out in 1-cm-
gap UV-transparent cuvettes using a spectrophotometer. 
For the measurements, the established optimal conditions 
were applied, so that the samples in buffer with pH 3.54 
were freeze-dried and taken up in DMSO. As can be seen in 
Fig. 3, linear absorption profiles at 260 nm were established 
for the main products MHET and TPA as well as for BHET. 
Duplicate determinations were made for each concentra-
tion. The coefficients of determination at a concentration 
of 25 µM obtained by linear regression are R 2 = 0.9992 for 
MHET, R2 = 0.9994 for BHET and R2 = 0.9996 for TPA, so 
that the measured values show an almost perfect linear rela-
tionship, which confirms the suitability of the method. The 
standard deviation values were between 0 and 0.004. Based 
on the slope of the calibration line, the different extinction 
coefficients could be determined to be 5400   M−1  cm−1 for 
MHET, 6100  M−1  cm−1 for BHET, and 4000  M−1  cm−1 for 
TPA. The amount of product can be slightly underestimated 
or overestimated by the absorbance measurement, depend-
ing on which extinction coefficient is used and if a product 
is more present in the mixture. Since MHET represents the 
major part of degradation products, the extinction coefficient 
of 5400  M−1  cm−1 is most appropriate. The detection limit 
for the absorption method was between 2.5 and 5 µM for 
all products. The highest absorption values were measured 
for BHET, closely followed by MHET. TPA had the lowest 
values.
The 1H NMR spectra shown in Fig. 3 represent the detec-
tion limits of the degradation products with the settings 
used on the Magritek Spinsolve 60 Carbon Benchtop NMR 
spectrometer as described above. These measurements were 
carried out with the same sample preparation as for bulk 
absorption, so that degradation products in buffer with pH 
9 were freeze-dried and taken up in DMSO. For MHET, the 
detection limit is between 5 and 10 µM, as well as for TPA. 
The spectra of BHET show a higher sensitivity so that even 
at 5 µM, a clear peak can still be detected, and the detec-
tion limit is thus below 5 µM. The different solvents can 
cause the ppm values to shift. For example, the spectra of 
the products dissolved in the buffer are highly field shifted 
whereas the peaks of the products dissolved in DMSO after 
drying are low field-shifted. Nevertheless, the shift remains 
the same for all 3 components, so that BHET has the high-
est ppm value, followed by MHET and then TPA, as can be 
seen in Fig.  3. Furthermore, the peak of MHET represents 
a singlet instead of a doublet, which can be attributed to a 
superposition of the peaks or the solvent change.
Discussion
To be able to use the combined method in the best possible 
way for future recycling strategies, further optimization is 
still required, especially with regard to the efficacy and effi-
ciency of the enzymes.
Limitation of the standard methods
The standard methods for measuring PET biodegradation, 
such as HPLC, are accurate and sensitive methods, but they 
are often based on endpoint measurements and thus do not 
provide information about enzyme behaviour over time (Son 
et al. 2019). Kinetic studies are essential for understand -
ing enzyme function, as reaction rates can decrease over 
time for some enzymes. The decrease in reaction rate can be 
explained, for example, by substrate consumption, inhibition 
by the resulting products or inappropriate reaction condi-
tions under which the enzymes are unstable (Bisswanger 
2017). Visual observations represent simple and rapid meth-
ods to obtain an initial overview of PET degradation, but 
these analyses do not ensure insight into enzyme kinetics 
either. Various methods with continuous measurements have 
already been set up, such as fluorescence detection methods, 
but these are not suitable for larger PET films, such as those 
found as pollution in the environment (Wei et al. 2012). 
Also, NaOH titration using a pH–stat as an indicator is not 
suitable for kinetic analysis, because the intermediate BHET 
is a neutral product and therefore cannot be detected (Ron-
kvist et al. 2009). With the absorption method described 
by Zhong-Johnson et al. (2021) and modified by us, con-
tinuous measurement can easily be carried out, because all 
degradation products contribute to the absorption due to 
their aromatic rings (Zhong-Johnson et al. 2021). Another 
positive aspect represents the high sensitivity of 2.5–5 µM 
for all degradation products, as can be seen in Fig.  3. Fur-
thermore, the bulk absorption method can be adapted to the 
measurement of degradation of other specific types of plas-
tics. However, this is only possible for those plastics whose 
degradation products have an aromatic ring that contributes 
to the absorption. An example is the thermoplastic polysty-
rene, which consists of the monomer styrene, an unsaturated 
aromatic hydrocarbon (Danso et al. 2019). Aromatic poly -
carbonates represent further examples (Wehrmann 2001). 
Both plastics have aromatics and can thus be quantified by 
20695Environmental Science and Pollution Research (2024) 31:20689–20697 
absorbance. Depending on the degradation mechanism of 
the enzymes involved, the absorbance measurements can be 
carried out either by increasing the degradation products or 
by decreasing the aromatic substrate.
According to the literature, the expected amounts of PET 
degradation products quantified by HPLC after 4 h of reac-
tion with wild-type PETase are about 30 µM for MHET, 
about 10 µM for TPA and about 2 µM for BHET; hence, the 
concentration range up to 25–50 µM is of particular inter -
est (Zhong-Johnson et al. 2021). It could be shown that the 
sensitivity of the absorption measurement with 2.5–5 µM 
was slightly higher than the 1H NMR analysis, which was 
between 5 and 10 µM for each degradation product. Accord-
ingly, the sensitivity of both methods is sufficiently high

sensitivity of the combined 
absorption/1H NMR method. 
The samples were prepared 
in buffer with pH 3.54, then 
freeze-dried and taken up in 
DMSO. Double determina-
tions were carried out for bulk 
absorbance. Absorbance profiles 
of 100 µM (a) and 25 µM (b) 
of TPA, MHET and BHET at 
260 nm were determined by 
measurements on a spectropho-
tometer with error bars indicat-
ing standard deviation between 
0.004 and 0. The detection limit 
for the absorption method was 
between 2.5 and 5 µM for all 
products. The corresponding 
spectra (c) were recorded on a 
Spinsolve 60 Carbon Benchtop 
NMR spectrometer for 16 h. A 
dilution series was measured 
for each degradation product to 
determine the detection limit. 
For TPA (bottom) and MHET 
(middle), the detection limit 
was between 5 and 10 µM, for 
BHET (top) below 5 µM

to investigate the enzymatic activity of PETase and its 
homologs in the context of an activity assay.
Inline measurements using flow cells
If only the presence of PET degradation products is to be 
determined, the bulk absorbance method is particularly suit-
able as the measurements can be performed in a few seconds 
with minimal effort and at low costs, so that rapid measure-
ments during an enzymatic reaction can be used to check 
whether degradation products are present at all. For exam-
ple, flow cells can be used for process photometers and allow 
inline measurement of enzymatically converted products 
from PET during a controlled automated process in a plant, 
eliminating the time required for sampling and measurement 
in the laboratory. However, no continuous measurements 
with flow cells were carried out as part of this study. Another 
positive feature is the prevention of contamination of the 
products. As already shown in other publications, automated 
continuous monitoring of various parameters using such 
flow cells is possible. Maierhofer et al. (2021), for example, 
present a novel inline measurement of ammonia in methanol, 
for which an ammonia sensor was combined with a flow 
cell, ensuring efficient measurement under continuous flow 
(Maierhofer et al. 2021). Jia et al. (2015) present another 
example of continuous measurement using flow cells for 
monitoring algea growth by optical density measurements at 
different wavelength in real time without any sample prepa-
ration (Jia et al. 2015). Accordingly, the aromatic degrada-
tion products of PET could also be continuously detected by 
using flow cells for process photometers. After and during 
the absorption measurement, the product distribution and 
identification can then be analysed by 1H NMR spectroscopy 
by taking and preparing samples at different times, because 
continuous measurement is not yet possible. Using the meth-
ods established in the current work, the product concentra-
tions in the wastewater after an enzymatic reaction with the 
PETase could be continuously monitored by bulk absorption 
measurement using flow cells followed by endpoint 1H NMR 
analysis to identify and distribute the products.
Conclusion
In this work, we were able to validate benchtop 1H NMR 
spectroscopy as a new method for the qualification of PET 
degradation products. We suggest the quantitative absorp-
tion method coupled with the qualitative benchtop 1H NMR 
method as a modern strategy for monitoring in the auto -
mated degradation of PET by enzymes. Enzymatic diges-
tion of PET releases aromatic products with each PETase 
homolog, so this combined absorption/ 1H NMR method 
has the great advantage that it can be used universally to 
determine the activity of all PETase homologs that equally 
degrade the plastic enzymatically into MHET, BHET and 
TPA. Furthermore, the bulk absorption method can be 
adapted to the measurement of degradation of other specific 
types of plastics that also have aromatic rings. In summary, 
the methods established in our work can potentially con-
tribute to the development of suitable recycling strategies 
of PET and other aromatic plastics degraded, for example, 
by recombinant enzymes immobilized on a suitable mem-
brane in wastewater. As a result, the plastic waste issue in 
the environment can be counteracted.
