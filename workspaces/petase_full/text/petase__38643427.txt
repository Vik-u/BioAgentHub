Abstract 
Non-equilibrium (NEQ) alchemical free energy calculations are an emerging tool for accurately predicting changes in protein 
folding free energy resulting from amino acid mutations. In this study, this method in combination with the Rosetta ddg 
monomer tool was applied to predict more thermostable variants of the polyethylene terephthalate (PET) degrading enzyme 
DuraPETase. The Rosetta ddg monomer tool efficiently enriched promising mutations prior to more accurate prediction by 
NEQ alchemical free energy calculations. The relative change in folding free energy of 96 single amino acid mutations was 
calculated by NEQ alchemical free energy calculation. Experimental validation of ten of the highest scoring variants identi-
fied two mutations  (DuraPETaseS61M and  DuraPETaseS223Y) that increased the melting temperature (Tm) of the enzyme by up 
to 1 °C. The calculated relative change in folding free energy showed an excellent correlation with experimentally determined 
Tm resulting in a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of r =  − 0.84. Limitations in the prediction of strongly stabilizing mutations 
were, however, encountered and are discussed. Despite these challenges, this study demonstrates the practical applicability 
of NEQ alchemical free energy calculations in prospective enzyme engineering projects.

Introduction
Enhancing the thermostability of enzymes is a key aspect 
in the field of enzyme engineering as biotechnological 
and industrial application processes require highly stable 
enzymes (Bommarius et al. 2011; Nezhad et al. 2022). 
Directed evolution has proven to be a successful approach 
for developing thermostable proteins (Labrou 2010). It is, 
however, labor intensive and screening of a large number 
of enzyme variants is necessary. This makes this approach 
expensive and limits it to enzymes for which high-throughput 
assays are available. Computational methods that can aid in 
protein or enzyme design to reduce the screening efforts 
have therefore gained popularity. Software tools such as 
FoldX, RosettaDesign, or PoPMuSiC 2.1 make use of semi-
empirical force fields to predict the change in folding free 
energy (∆∆Gfolding) of given mutations (Dehouck et al. 2009; 
Guerois et al. 2002; Kellogg et al. 2011). ∆∆G folding gives 
the difference in ∆Gfolding between a wild-type and a mutant 
protein, whereas ∆G folding is the difference in free energy 
between the unfolded and the folded states. The prediction 
accuracy of these methods is however highly dependent 
on the investigated protein (Buß et al. 2018). Most of the 
time, a relatively high number of predictions still need to be 
tested to identify more stable variants (Wijma et al. 2014). 
Nevertheless, semi-empirical force field-based methods 
usually perform better than random selection of mutations 
(Buß et al. 2018). These predictions are often complemented 
by molecular dynamic (MD) simulations with subsequent 
analysis of the protein’s flexibility and/or hydrophobic 
Sebastian Schreiber and David Gercke contributed equally.

surface area (Childers and Daggett 2017; Floor et al. 2014; 
Wang et al. 2018). The results attained from MD simulations 
are however difficult to analyze objectively, since analysis 
is dependent on correct visual inspection and interpretation 
of the MD trajectory (Wijma et al. 2014). In recent years, 
physically rigorous free energy calculations emerged as a 
promising new tool for the prediction of ∆∆G folding. When 
using this method to calculate ∆∆Gfolding in a conventional, 
non-alchemical way, sampling of the complete folding or 
unfolding path of each variant is necessary. Even though this 
is possible in principle, it requires a lot of computational 
effort and is therefore often not feasible. Alchemical free 
energy calculations are physically rigorous calculations that 
circumvent this problem by estimating free energy differences 
along nonphysical, so-called alchemical paths that are more 
accessible to sampling by MD or Monte Carlo simulations. 
This way, alchemical free energy methods account for solvent 
effects, conformational changes, and electrostatic interactions 
with higher precision than semi-empirical methods. Several 
different approaches to alchemical free energy calculations 
have been developed and used in the past. Among the most 
popular is the free energy perturbation method based on the 
principles first published by Zwanzig (1954). Using this 
method, equilibrium simulations for several intermediate 
states along the alchemical path are simulated. From 
these, free energy differences are then estimated (Bennett 
1976; Shirts and Chodera 2008). This approach has been 
implemented in the Schrödinger molecular modeling suite 
and has been used in several publications to accurately predict 
∆∆Gfolding or protein–protein interaction free energies upon 
amino acid mutation (Ford and Babaoglu 2017; Steinbrecher 
et al. 2017a, 2017b). It is, however, also possible to derive 
free energy differences from non-equilibrium simulations 
(NEQ) (Crooks 1999; Jarzynski 1997a, b). This was made 
easily accessibly within the GROMACS framework over the 
last couple of years by the group around de Groot (Gapsys 
et al. 2015b; Seeliger and de Groot 2010). This approach has 
been shown to give good prediction accuracy in retrospective 
studies, in which literature values were used to verify the 
validity of the predictions. Recently, the approach was also 
used prospectively to guide the functional analysis of a 
disease conferring mutation in the proliferating cell nuclear 
antigen followed by experimental validation (Hardebeck 
et al. 2023). Prospective, larger scale studies employing this 
method for the prediction of more thermostable enzyme 
variants, followed by experimental validation, are however 
scarce. We therefore decided to test the ability of a workflow 
based on NEQ alchemical free energy calculations to improve 
the thermal stability of a biotechnologically relevant enzyme. 
The development of solutions for the environmental burden 
of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) remains a daunting 
challenge (Yoshida et al. 2016). For the degradation of 
PET, the use of highly active biocatalysts is a promising 
approach. Since PET degradation is most efficient near the 
glass transition temperature of PET (ca. 70 °C), increasing 
the thermostability of the PET-degrading enzyme IsPETase 
is crucial for the efficient application of the enzyme in 
industrial processes (Jog 1995; Wei and Zimmermann 2017). 
Significant efforts have already been made to optimize and 
improve IsPETase (Bell et al. 2022; Brott et al. 2022; Liu 
et al. 2022; Lu et al. 2022; Shi et al. 2023; Zurier and Goddard 
2023). DuraPETase is one of the most thermostable variants, 
with one of the highest PET degradation rates known today 
(Cui et al. 2021). It was created by experimentally testing and 
combining a library of 85 different mutations. This resulted 
in a thermostable enzyme variant of mesophilic PETase 
with ten additional point mutations and a T m elevated by 
31 to 78 °C. Further improvement of DuraPETase should 
therefore pose an interesting and challenging test case for the 
performance of the NEQ alchemical free energy approach.
Here, we present a study that utilizes NEQ alchemical 
free energy calculations prospectively to identify variants of 
DuraPETase with enhanced thermostability. We systemati-
cally evaluated the performance of two computational meth-
ods, Rosetta ddg monomer and NEQ free energy calcula-
tions, for the prediction of more thermostable variants of the 
highly thermostable DuraPETase. Calculations with Rosetta 
ddg monomer proved to be able to enrich stabilizing muta-
tions. However, predictions did not significantly correlate 
with experimentally determined Tm. ∆∆Gfolding of 23 Dura-
PETase variants (Table S1) predicted by NEQ free energy 
calculations correlated well with experimentally determined 
Tm with a Pearson’s correlation coefficient of r  = -0.84. 
Among these variants, two variants  (DuraPETaseS61M and 
 DuraPETaseS223Y) had increased Tm by up to 1 °C compared 
to the original DuraPETase.
Material and methods
Plasmid construction, mutagenesis, expression, 
and protein purification
The sequence of DuraPETase (GenBank: GAP38373.1) was 
codon optimized for E. coli and synthesized by Twist Bio-
science (South San Francisco, USA). The codon-optimized 
sequence of the DuraPETase gene is given in Sequence S1. 
It was inserted into the plasmid p15-mNeonGreen (Hard-
ebeck et al. 2023) by restriction and ligation to create the 
plasmid pDuraPETase for intracellular expression of the 
original DuraPETase under control of a T7 promotor. Point 
mutations for the generation of DuraPETase variants were 
introduced by PCR via In-Fusion cloning (Takara Bio, 
Kusatsu, Japan). E. coli BL21(DE3) was used as the host 
for protein expression. Cells containing one of the respective 
plasmids for the expression of the original DuraPETase or its

variants were grown in 500 ml lysogeny broth-Miller (LB) 
medium supplemented with 50 µg/ml carbenicillin at 33 °C 
and 160 rpm. Gene expression was induced with 1 mM 
IPTG as soon as an optical density at 578 nm of 0.8 was 
reached and incubation was continued for 24 h at 16 °C and 
160 rpm. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (5000 × g, 
10 min, 4 °C), suspended in 5 ml loading buffer (50 mM 
 NaH2PO4, 300 mM NaCl, 10 mM imidazole, pH 8), and 
lysed using a sonicator. Cell debris were removed by cen-
trifugation (48,000 × g, 15 min, 4 °C). The supernatant was 
used to isolate the respective enzyme via Ni–NTA affinity 
chromatography using Protino Ni–NTA agarose beads (Th. 
Geyer, Höxter, Germany), and the buffer was exchanged for 
storage buffer (50 mM  Na2HPO4-Hcl, pH 7, 100 mM NaCl) 
by dialysis. Enzyme concentrations were determined by 
measuring the absorbance at 280 nm.
Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF)
To determine the apparent T m of the original DuraPETase 
and its variants by DSF, 4 µM of the respective enzyme in 
25 µl of PBS containing a total of 20 × SYPRO orange pro-
tein gel stain (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) and a Rotor-
Gene Q 2 Plex HRM (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) were used 
(Lavinder et al. 2009). The samples were heated from 30 
to 95 °C, increasing the temperature by 0.5 °C every 5 s. 
SYPRO orange was excited at 470 ± 10 nm, and the emis-
sion was detected at 610 ± 5 nm. All measurements were 
performed three times from individually prepared samples. 
The apparent T m were calculated from the extreme points 
of the first derivative of the fluorescence dF/DT(T) formed 
from the recorded melting curves as function F(T) using the 
Rotor-Gene Q software.
Determination of PET degradation rates
The PET degradation rates for the original DuraPETase and 
its variants were tested using amorphous PET (2.4% crystal-
linity, determined by differential scanning calorimetry) with 
a thickness of 0.25 mm purchased from Goodfellow Cam-
bridge Limited (Huntingdon, England). Substrate cut-outs 
with a diameter of 6 mm were incubated in 300 µl of 50 mM 
bicine NaOH buffer pH 9 containing 100 nM of the respec-
tive enzyme in microvolume reaction tubes. All reactions 
were performed as triplicates and were incubated at 50 °C 
or 52 °C and 300 rpm for 3 days. The reactions were stopped 
by removing the substrate. Three volumes of acetonitrile 
were added, and a centrifugation step (20,000 × g, 10 min) 
was performed. For each sample, 10 µl of the supernatant 
was injected into a LaChrom Elite HPLC system equipped 
with a L-2455 DAD detector (Hitachi, Chiyoda, Japan) and 
a Nucleodur C18 HTec column (Macherey–Nagel, Düren, 
Germany). The separation was performed isocratically at 
40 °C with a flow rate of 0.5 ml/min for 8 min using 70% 
 ddH2O, 20% acetonitrile, and 10% formic acid. The signal 
was detected at 254 nm, and standards of the reaction prod-
ucts terephthalic acid (TCI, Tokyo, Japan) and 2-hydroxy -
ethyl terephthalic acid (Activate Scientific, Prien am Chiem-
see, Germany) were used to quantify the degradation rate.
Rosetta ddg monomer calculations
Rosetta version 3.12 was used for the ddg monomer  
calculations. The crystal structure of DuraPETase (PDB 
ID: 6ky5) was used for all calculations. Only chain A was 
retained. Ions and water molecules were deleted. First, 
minimization was performed using distance constrains on 
Cα atoms. The protocol described as “row 3” in Kellogg 
et al. was used for all calculations. This protocol was 
chosen, because it exhibited a high prediction accuracy 
for the dataset analyzed in the original publication (Kellog 
et al. 2011), while also appeared to be computationally 
inexpensive. The commands are described in detail in the 
Supporting information of Kellogg et al. (2011).
NEQ alchemical free energy calculations
System preparation
The crystal structure of DuraPETase (PDB ID: 6ky5) was 
retrieved from the PDB server. Only chain A was retained. 
Ions and water molecules were deleted. Protonation states 
were assigned with the Protonate 3D function from MOE 
(Molecular Operating Environment, Chemical Computing 
Group, Canada version: 2022.02) using default settings 
at pH = 7.0. Mutations were generated using the Protein 
Builder. Sidechains were repacked and minimized using the 
Minimize tool, while a tether was applied to the backbone. 
The structures were exported from MOE in PDB format and 
used for MD system preparation within GROMACS 2019.3 
(Abraham et al. 2015).
Free energy calculations and hybrid topology generation
For the estimation of the change in folding free energy 
(∆∆Gfolding) upon amino acid mutation, a well-established 
thermodynamic cycle was constructed according to Alde-
ghi et al. (2019). The cycle is also shown in Figure S1 for 
clarity. The alchemical transitions between both end states 
were performed along the ∆G 1 arrow for the unfolded and 
along the ∆G3 arrow for the folded state. The unfolded state 
was modeled by a Gly-X-Gly tripeptide as done in previ-
ous publications (Gapsys et al. 2015b, 2016). All simula-
tions were run independently from each other. The pmx

package was used to generate hybrid topologies (Gapsys 
et al. 2015b). This was done after equilibrium simulations 
were performed. This way, equilibrium trajectories of the 
original DuraPETase could be used for different amino acid 
transitions.
Molecular dynamic (MD) simulations
GROMACS 2019.3 was used to carry out all MD simula-
tions (Abraham et al. 2015). The Amber99SB*ILDN force 
field was used to model the protein (Lindorff-Larsen et al. 
2010). Water molecules were represented by the TIP3P water 
model. Proteins or tripeptides were solvated in a cubic box 
with 150 mM of  Na+ and  Cl− ions. The total charge of the 
system was neutralized with either  Na+ or  Cl−. For equilib-
rium simulations, energy minimization was performed using 
the steepest decent method. Equilibration was performed for 
500 ps in the NVT and for 500 ps in the NPT ensemble. A 
position restraint with a value for the harmonic force con-
stants of 1000 kJ  mol−1  nm−2 was applied to all heavy atoms 
of the system during both equilibration phases. Production 
simulations were run for 10 ns. H-Bonds were constrained 
using LINCS algorithm (Hess et al. 1997), and the simula-
tion temperature was controlled by the velocity rescaling 
thermostat at 300 K every 0.1 ps (Bussi et al. 2007). The 
Parrinello-Rahman barostat was used to control pressure at 
1 atm (Parrinello and Rahman 1981). Particle mesh Ewald 
was used to treat electrostatic interactions in the simulation 
with a cutoff set to 1.2 nm (Essmann et al. 1995). The mean 
RMSD during the production stage of each replica was cal-
culated to check the system stability.
After equilibrium simulation, snapshots were extracted 
to construct hybrid topologies and perform the NEQ transi-
tion simulations. To do so, the first 2.5 ns of each trajectory 
was discarded and 75 snapshots were extracted equidistantly 
from the remaining trajectory. The pmx package was used 
to generate hybrid topologies (Gapsys et al. 2015b). Transi-
tions were performed in 100 ps after energy minimization 
and 50 ps of equilibration. The resulting change in λ  was 
5 ×  10−5/step. A softcore potential with default parameters 
was applied to the Lennard–Jones and electrostatic inter -
actions. Using the scripts provided with the pmx package, 
extracted work values were used to estimate the free energy 
at 300 K. The free energy estimation was based on the 
Crooks fluctuation theorem (Crooks 1999). Bennett accept-
ance ratio was used as a maximum likelihood estimator 
(Shirts et al. 2003). The uncertainty given is the standard 
deviation over multiple independent replicas. Either ten or 
four independent replicas were used at different stages of the 
study as stated in the “Results” section.
Results
In silico screening for stabilizing mutations 
in DuraPETase using ddg monomer
The high computational demand of alchemical free energy 
calculations is one of its drawbacks and makes compre-
hensive screening of the entire mutational space of a 
protein practically impossible in the foreseeable future. 
Semi-empirical force field-based methods provide a fast 
alternative to systematically analyze single-point muta-
tions of the entire protein. We therefore decided to include 
a first virtual screening step using the Rosetta ddg mono-
mer tool in the optimization of thermostability of Dura-
PETase (Kellogg et al. 2011). This also provided the 
opportunity to test, whether further improvement of the 
thermostability of DuraPETase could be achieved using 
this simpler approach. A systematic screening of all pos-
sible single amino acid mutations, with some exceptions, 
was performed. Firstly, mutations from and to proline are 
not supported by the later employed NEQ free energy cal -
culations at the moment. They were therefore excluded in 
this step. Secondly, mutations involving the catalytic triad 
of DuraPETase were also excluded, as these amino acids 
are essential for catalytic activity. Lastly, charge change 
mutations were shown to be poorly predicted by the ddg 
monomer approach (Gapsys et al. 2016). Charge change 
mutations also need to be setup in a slightly different 
way for the NEQ free energy calculations due to artifacts 
introduced by a net charge change. Additionally, even if 
properly set up, charge change mutations still require sub -
stantially longer to reach convergence during the simula-
tion (Patel et al. 2021). Taking all of this into account, 
we decided to exclude charge change mutations from our 
screening. In the end, this resulted in a total of 2838 single 
amino acid mutations for the 264 amino acids comprising 
DuraPETase. The change in folding free energy of these 
mutations was calculated with ddg monomer employing 
the row 3 protocol from Kellogg et al. (2011). These cal-
culations were completed in a single day on a medium-
sized cluster. Mutations were then ranked according to 
their score, which is intended to correlate with ∆∆G  but 
is not a quantitatively predicted change in folding free 
energy (Fig.  1a). The score calculated with ddg monomer  
will be named ∆∆G Rosetta  in the following to distinguish 
it from the ∆∆Gfolding determined by NEQ alchemical free 
energy calculations. Cutoff values varying from <  − 0.75 
to <  − 5 kcal/mol are often used to identify stabiliz-
ing mutations (Buß et al. 2018; Wijma et al. 2014). The 
cutoff for the mutational scan of DuraPETase was set to 
∆∆GRosetta <  − 3.8 kcal/mol. This was within the normally

chosen range of cutoff values and comprises the top 5% of 
the scores corresponding to 130 different DuraPETase var -
iants. These variants should next be characterized experi-
mentally. As our laboratory capacities did not allow for the 
purification and characterization of around 130 different 
DuraPETase variants, 13 variants were chosen randomly 
from below the threshold for experimental verification. 
Variants were purified by Ni–NTA affinity chromatogra-
phy. The respective change in the apparent melting tem-
peratures (ΔT m) for each variant compared to the original 
DuraPETase was calculated by substracting the T m of the 
original DuraPETase from the T m of the variant. Both T m 
were measured by differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) 
(Fig.  1b). Only a single variant,  DuraPETase S42M, had a 
significantly higher T m than the original DuraPETase. The 
Tm of the  DuraPETase S42M  variant was 0.66 ± 0.17 °C 
higher. The T m of  DuraPETase S136I  and  DuraPETase A80I 
did not differ from the original DuraPETase. All other 
variants had significantly lower T m when compared to the 
original DuraPETase. Consequently, the success rate was 
low. The prediction accuracy was also rather poor, as four 
of the mutations  (DuraPETase G155M ,  DuraPETaseA170L , 
 DuraPETaseG251I, and  DuraPETase G251W) predicted to be 
stabilizing were destabilized by more than 5 °C. Due to the 
low prediction accuracy, a set of 13 DuraPETase variants 
with a wide range of T m was obtained, providing a reason-
able dataset that was used to test the accuracy of NEQ free 
energy calculations for the DuraPETase in a next step.
Prediction accuracy of NEQ free energy calculations 
of DuraPETase
In order to analyze how well the results from the experi-
mental testing could be calculated with NEQ free energy 
calculations, these calculations were performed for all of 
the 13 variants that were tested experimentally in the first 
screening round (Fig.  1b). Ten independent calculations 
were performed for each amino acid mutation using equi-
librium trajectories of 10 ns in order to obtain a reliable esti-
mate of uncertainty. Previous research has shown that run-
ning several short simulations results in more accurate error 
estimates than running fewer long simulations (Bhati and 
Coveney 2022). Analysis of the mean RMSD of the original 
DuraPETase confirmed the stability of the system during 
equilibrium MD simulation (Supplementary Figure S2). The 
hybrid topologies for the NEQ transitions were constructed 
after running the equilibrium trajectories, as explained in the 
“Material and methods” section. This way, the equilibrium 
trajectories of the original DuraPETase could be used for 
all transitions, which substantially reduced computational 
cost. NEQ free energy calculations are easily scalable, as the 
many short non-equilibrium transitions can be run indepen-
dently. This way, calculations could be performed relatively 
quickly in approx. 3 days, on a medium-sized cluster. Pre-
dicted ∆∆Gfolding was obtained as the result of the calcula-
tion. Figure  2 shows the correlation between the predicted 
∆∆Gfolding and the experimentally determined ∆Tm of the 13 
DuraPETase variants described above. A significant Pearson 
Fig. 1  a Cumulative distribution of ddg monomer results predict-
ing the change in folding free energy upon amino acid mutation of 
DuraPETase. Mutations from and to proline, mutations involving a 
net charge change, and mutations involving the catalytic triad were 
excluded. The red box indicates the 130 variants below the cutoff  
value of ∆∆G Rosetta <  − 3.8  kcal/mol from which 13 were randomly 
selected for experimental validation. b ∆T m were calculated by sub-
tracting the T m value of the original DuraPETase from the T m value 
of each respective variant. T m values were determined by DSF. The 
variants were randomly selected among the variants within the top 
5% of predictions made with ddg monomer. Measurements were per -
formed in triplicate. Statistical significance was analyzed by one-way 
ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test. Single asterisk 
(*) corresponds to p < 0.05 and triple asterisk (***) corresponds to 
p < 0.001

correlation between ∆∆G folding and ∆Tm of r =  − 0.84 was 
determined. Linear regression gave an R 2 = 0.70. A nega-
tive correlation was expected, as higher or more positive 
∆∆Gfolding values correspond to thermodynamically unsta-
ble proteins. These proteins have a lower T m and therefore 
a negative ∆T m. Even though ten replicas were used for 
∆∆Gfolding calculations, the prediction accuracy for the 13 
DuraPETase mutations also remained consistent when using 
only four randomly selected replicas. Therefore, it should be 
sufficient in this case to run only four replicas per prediction 
for further calculations to reduce the computational burden. 
It is worth noting that our dataset is biased towards pre-
dominantly destabilizing mutations. It is therefore especially 
encouraging that  DuraPETaseS42M, which is the only stabi-
lizing mutation, is predicted with ∆∆Gfolding =  − 6.7 kJ/mol, 
the lowest among the predictions. Overall, we concluded 
that NEQ free energy calculations can identify stabilizing 
mutations in DuraPETase.
Two‑step screening approach using ddg monomer 
and NEQ free energy calculations
Free energy changes calculated by NEQ free energy calcula-
tions showed a strong correlation with experimentally deter-
mined Tm but are computationally demanding. We therefore 
aimed to determine if the results of the ddg monomer cal-
culations could serve as an initial screening tool to enrich 
promising mutations for further investigation. Twenty single 
amino acid mutations were selected from the ddg mono-
mer prediction pool of 801 predictions having a ∆∆G Rosetta 
exceeding 4 kcal/mol. Another 20 were selected from a pool 
of 2037 predictions with a ∆∆ GRosetta lower than 4 kcal/
mol. This cutoff was selected to test whether Rosetta ddg 
monomer could differentiate destabilizing mutations from 
stabilizing or neutral ones. The subsets were labelled “high” 
and “low,” respectively. NEQ free energy calculations were 
used to predict ∆∆G folding for each individual amino acid 
mutation in both groups. The simulations for one mutation in 
the high subset did not converge properly, as evident by the 
insufficient overlap in the work distribution to estimate ∆G. 
This mutation was excluded from further analysis. Thus, 
the resulting dataset consisted of 39 data points. The mean 
∆∆Gfolding calculated with the NEQ alchemical free energy 
workflow was compared between the high and low datasets 
(Fig. 3a). The mean ∆∆G folding for all predictions derived 
from the high subset was 21.18 ± 5.36 kJ/mol. In contrast, 
the mean ∆∆G folding for all predictions from the low  sub-
set was 4.01 ± 4.53 kJ/mol. This difference was statistically 
significant (p  = 0.020). The four most negative ∆∆G folding 
predictions all belonged to the low  subset. Subsequently, 
∆∆Gfolding values, which were calculated with the NEQ free 
energy protocol, were plotted against ∆∆G Rosetta for every 
single amino acid mutation (Fig.  3b). The ∆∆G Rosetta and 
∆∆Gfolding were significantly correlated with Pearson’s cor-
relation coefficient of r  = 0.39. Consequently, ∆∆ GRosetta 
can provide a rough estimation of the impact of a single 
amino acid mutation on protein stability. This suggests that 
ddg monomer  can serve as an initial enrichment tool for 
identifying potentially favorable mutations. This way, the 
computational effort for the identification of potentially sta-
bilizing mutations with NEQ free energy calculations may 
be reduced.

In the first two parts of this study, a model was built that 
could accurately predict the change in thermostability of 
DuraPETase upon single amino acid mutation. In the third 
part, it was also shown that ddg monomer calculations can 
be used to enrich promising mutations. We now decided 
to utilize these findings prospectively, to identify stabiliz-
ing mutations in addition to  DuraPETase S42M. To do so, 
∆∆Gfolding of another 60 variants was predicted. The entire 
workflow including the verification steps is summarized in 
Fig. 4. In accordance with the results presented above, the 
variants were randomly selected from the low group of ddg 
monomer predictions. Together with 40 already calculated 
mutations (Fig. 3), a total of 100 predictions were run. Out 
of these 100, the results of the calculations for four muta-
tions could not be analyzed properly because the overlap in 
the work distribution for estimating ∆G was insufficient. In 
the end, this resulted in 96 successfully calculated ∆∆Gfolding 
predictions (Fig. 5a). The top ranking 11 mutations all were

∆∆Gfolding for each mutation is the standard deviation of ten inde-
pendent replicas. A significant negative correlation between ∆T m and 
∆∆Gfolding was observed (Pearson r = -0.85, p = 0.002, N = 13). Linear 
regression (black line) gave an R2 = 0.70

mutations to aromatic amino acids. To minimize potential 
bias, we decided to choose variants for experimental vali-
dation from among the top predictions as follows. A cutoff  
value of ∆∆G folding =  − 6.5 kJ/mol that corresponds to the 
calculated ∆∆G folding of the already identified stabilizing 
 DuraPETaseS42M variant was chosen. Nineteen variants were 
below this cutoff value. Ten variants were selected semi-ran-
domly from these variants. However, the number of muta-
tions to each single amino acid was limited to a maximum of 
three. The selected variants were expressed and purified and 
the Tm was measured by DSF (Fig.  5b). Two variants had 
significantly higher Tm than the original DuraPETase. Five 
variants had the same Tm as the original DuraPETase, while 
three variants had lower Tm.  DuraPETaseS223Y was the most 
stable among all tested variants. The Tm was 0.93 °C higher 
than that of the original DuraPETase.  DuraPETaseA280W had 
a Tm that was 2.30 °C lower than that of the original Dura-
PETase. It was the most unstable variant. The entire range of 
determined Tm from this screening was only 3.43 °C. This is 
distinctly smaller than in the first screening round that was 
based on ddg monomer predictions, which had a range of 
Tm of 21.66 °C. The number of mutations that were identi-
fied to be stabilizing with the second screening round was 
higher, two compared to one, even though the number of 
enzymes tested was smaller (10 instead of 13). There was 
however no significant correlation between the ∆ Tm val-
ues and ∆∆G folding for the variants from the second round 
screening (r =  − 0.17, p = 0.63, N = 10) (Fig. 5c). ∆Tm val-
ues of all 23 experimentally tested mutations were plotted 
against the calculated ∆∆G folding (Fig. 5d). This resulted in 
a Pearson correlation of r  =  − 0.82, which is slightly worse 
than the correlation determined for the first dataset alone. 
This shows that the prediction accuracy over the entire range 
of mutations is very good. When only focusing on stabilizing 
mutations, the prediction accuracy drops however. The lower 
accuracy of the predictions for stabilizing mutations also 
explains the slightly lower correlation of the entire dataset, 
when compared to the mutations from the first screening 
round alone. These results indicate that NEQ calculations 
predict ∆∆Gfolding accurately as long as the mutation is not 
strongly stabilizing. With mutations predicted to be stabi-
lizing, the effect seems to be overestimated. Stabilizing or 
neutral mutations are nevertheless enriched by the NEQ free 
energy calculations.
PET hydrolysis by DuraPETase variants
In addition to the already determined T m for the ten Dura-
PETase variants from the second round of screening, their 
respective activities on amorphous PET were analyzed 
as well (Fig.  6). Since the variant  DuraPETase S42M from 
the first round was found to be stabilizing, it was also 
included. The activity was tested at 50 °C and 52 °C to see 
how the enzymes performed at the optimum temperature 
of the original DuraPETase (50 °C) and slightly above 
this temperature. Overall, the changes in activity at 50 °C 
and 52 °C reflect the observed changes in thermostability.

tion subsets. The high subset was defined as predictions with a

with a ∆∆G Rosetta < 4  kcal/mol. The mean ∆∆G folding was signifi-
cantly lower for the low  subset (p = 0.013), as indicated by an aster -

observed

 Tm—showed practically identical PET degradation rates at 
50 °C compared to the original DuraPETase but was approx. 
ten percent more active at 52 °C. Similarly, a better per -
formance at 52 °C was also recorded for one of the other 
two more thermostable variants,  DuraPETaseS42M. For the 
third stable variant,  DuraPETaseS61M, the same tendency was 
observed at 52 °C, the results were however not statistically 
significant. The variants  DuraPETaseG75I,  DuraPETaseA280W, 
and  DuraPETaseA280Q all showed a reduced thermostability. 
In line with this, there was a pronounced decrease of PET 
degradation rates at 50 °C for these variants. The overall 
changes in thermostability of the new variants were rela-
tively small compared to the already very high Tm of original 
DuraPETase. In line with this, only relatively small changes 
could be measured when analyzing the PET degradation 
activity at a temperature slightly above the original opti-
mum temperature.
Discussion
In this study, a workflow for the improvement of enzyme 
thermostability based around the Rosetta ddg monomer  
tool and NEQ alchemical free energy calculations was 
developed. DuraPETase, the enzyme optimized in this 
study, is a highly evolved thermostable enzyme (Cui et al. 
2021) and therefore an interesting test case for the perfor -
mance and limitations of the NEQ alchemical free energy 
calculation approach. Alchemical free energy calculations 
have been established as a powerful tool for predicting 
the change in protein stability upon amino acid muta-
tion (Gapsys et al. 2016; Steinbrecher et al. 2017b). They 
therefore provide the opportunity to reduce the number of 
enzyme variants that need to be tested experimentally. The 
high computational demand of free energy calculations has 
however limited their use in prospective studies.

This study demonstrates how to integrate free energy 
calculations into a protein engineering project to supplement 
well-established semi-empirical in silico methods (Bell et al. 
2022; Cui et al. 2021). The use of the ddg monomer tool 
in the first round of screening resulted in the identification 
of a single DuraPETase variant with higher thermostability 
among 13 tested variants. Compared with previous results 
also using semi-empirical methods, this is on the lower end 
of successful predictions (Buß et al. 2018; Wijma et al. 
2018). The outcome was however potentially better than 
the expected 2% success rate in a directed evolutionary 
approach (Bromberg and Rost 2009). Due to the rather 
small sample size, this is just a rough approximation 
and cannot be judged reliably. The NEQ alchemical free 
energy calculations performed next, resulted in a very good 
correlation between the experimentally measured T m and 
the predicted ∆∆G folding. Pearson’s correlation coefficient 
was − 0.85. Linear regression gave an R2 = 0.73. Notably, Tm 
is not a direct measure for ∆Gunfolding at standard conditions 
(Peccati et al. 2023). Nevertheless, the correlation between 
Tm and ∆Gunfolding generally is extremely high (Gapsys et al. 
2016; Wijma et al. 2014). Pearson’s correlation coefficient 
for the Δ Tm and changes in folding free energy falls 
within the same range as the previously reported excellent 
correlation of r  = 0.86 determined with the same approach 
(Gapsys et al. 2016). Studies employing equilibrium free

dictions from the ddg monomer results, while 20 were chosen from

distribution for estimating ∆G was observed. They were excluded 
from further analysis. In total, the results of 96 predictions are shown.

energy calculations. c Experimentally determined ∆T m values plot-

deviation of three independent measurements. Statistical significance

energy perturbations (FEP) reported on slightly worse R 2 
of 0.4 and 0.65 compared to the R 2 of 0.73 reported in 
this study for the correlation between experimentally and 
predicted ∆∆Gunfolding (Jespers et al. 2019; Scarabelli et al. 
2022; Steinbrecher et al. 2017b). One reason for the high 
correlation between Tm and ∆∆Gunfolding in our dataset might 
be the fact that we excluded charge changing mutations from 
our predictions. Charge change mutations have been shown 
to converge slower and are predicted less accurately by both 
NEQ and EQ alchemical free energy calculations (Clark 
et al. 2019; Patel et al. 2021). Purposefully omitting them 
might therefore increase the prediction accuracy.
With the intent to combine the ddg monomer tool and 
NEQ alchemical free energy calculations in the second 
screening round, it was first shown that the ddg monomer  
tool can enrich stabilizing mutations. Selection of mutations 
from a subset of possible mutations with lower ∆∆G Rosetta 
led to an on average lower ∆∆G folding predicted by NEQ 
alchemical free energy calculations. This shows that muta-
tions with lower scores from the ddg monomer tool should 
be prioritized for free energy calculations. This two-step 
approach has the potential to save significant amounts of 
computational time while simultaneously enabling the 
screening of large portions of the sequence space. Out of 
a total of 96 NEQ alchemical free energy calculations, 19 
were below a cutoff of − 6.5 kJ/mol. Out of these 19, 11 were 
mutations to aromatic amino acids. These mutations are 
generally considered to be stabilizing (Serrano et al. 1991). 
Aromatic amino acids thermodynamically favor the folded 
state of a protein, as this minimizes the solvent exposed 
hydrophobic surface area and enables hydrophobic interac-
tions between the amino acids. It is however also possible 
that the stabilizing effect of aromatic amino acids might be 
overestimated by the NEQ alchemical free energy calcula-
tions, due to insufficient sampling or force field inaccuracies. 
This is also why we limited the experimental validation of 
variants to a maximum of three variants for a mutation into 
any single amino acid.
Ten of the variants predicted to be stabilizing in the sec-
ond screening round were tested experimentally. No sig-
nificant correlation between experimental and predicted 
values was observed for these ten variants. The prediction 
accuracy over the entire dataset of 23 mutations was how -
ever still good, with a Pearson’s correlations coefficient of 
r =  − 0.83. This indicates a better performance of the NEQ 
alchemical free energy calculations for destabilizing and 
neutral mutations and a worse prediction accuracy for sta-
bilizing ones. In contrast to these findings, previous studies 
have shown that the correlation between experimental and 
predicted ∆∆Gfolding is roughly the same for stabilizing and 
destabilizing mutations (Gapsys et al. 2016; Steinbrecher 
et al. 2017b). Naturally occurring proteins, as used in the 
datasets of theses previous studies, are most often meso-
philic and only marginally stable (Goldenzweig and Fleish-
man 2018; Taverna and Goldstein 2002). DuraPETase, with 
its Tm of 78 °C, is however already highly thermostable. 
From this, the question arises, if the performance of NEQ 
free alchemical free energy calculations is worse for single 
amino acid mutations that further increase the stability of 
already highly stable proteins. Theoretically, this should 
not be the case, as NEQ alchemical free energy calculations 
present a physically rigorous way of calculating changes in 
protein folding free energy. Insufficient sampling during 
the MD simulation can however influence the accuracy of 
the predictions. Highly stable proteins are often more rigid, 
and transitions between relevant conformations might take 
more time, because they are separated from each other by 
higher energy barriers. Thorough sampling of all relevant 
conformations for highly stable proteins might therefore take 
more time than for less stable ones. This directly impacts the 
accuracy of the free energy prediction, as it is dependent on 
a correct frequency distribution of all relevant conforma-
tions. Performing multiple independent replicas, as done in 
this study, should provide a first indication if insufficient 
sampling poses a problem in the system under investigation. 
If, however, the number of replicas is too small and relevant 
conformations are only marginally populated, this approach 
might nevertheless provide a false error estimate. A con-
venient way to detect such limitations during MD sampling 
could be the usage of closed thermodynamic cycles with 
Fig. 6  Relative activity alterations of DuraPETase variants at 50  °C 
and 52  °C in comparison to the original DuraPETase. The purified 
enzymes were used at 100 nmol/l and incubated for 3 days at 50 °C 
or 52  °C in 300  µl of 50  mmol/l bicine NaOH buffer pH 9 with a 
6  mm diameter cutout of amorphous PET. The PET degradation 
activity was quantified by determining the concentration of the reac-
tion products by HPLC. The changes in activity are given as relative 
values and are normalized to the PET degradation rates for the orig-
inal DuraPETase at 50  °C and 52  °C, respectively. All experiments 
were performed as triplicates. Statistical significance was analyzed by 
one-way ANOVA with Dunnett’s multiple comparison test against the 
DuraPETase sample at the corresponding temperature. Triple asterisk 
(***) corresponds to p < 0.001, double asterisk (**) corresponds to 
p < 0.01, and single asterisk (*) corresponds to p < 0.05

relative free energy differences at their edges. If the sum of 
all relative free energy changes deviates from zero, insuffi-
cient sampling for one or multiple of the mutations could be 
an issue (Gapsys et al. 2015a; Hardebeck et al. 2023). Both 
approaches mentioned above, the use of closed thermody -
namic cycle and increasing the number of independent rep-
licas, come however with a substantial increase in computa-
tional effort and need to be considered carefully. Aside from 
potential sampling issues, force field parametrization also 
influences the performance of NEQ alchemical free energy 
calculations (Gapsys et al. 2016). The force fields used in 
molecular simulations are typically parameterized based on 
experimental data and may not fully capture the nuances of 
highly stable proteins (Lindorff-Larsen et al. 2010). To the 
best of our knowledge, a comprehensive investigation on the 
performance of force fields on highly stable proteins has not 
been undertaken thus far. This could be an interesting topic 
for future research in the context of the application of free 
energy calculations.
Overall, we managed to identify three mutations that 
increased the thermostability of DuraPETase. The increase 
in thermostability was however limited, especially when 
compared with other optimizations of IsPETase (Bell et al. 
2022; Cui et al. 2021; Lu et al. 2022). It is also a rather 
limited number of successfully identified mutations when 
compared to another protein engineering project. Song et al. 
used the well-established FoldX tool in conjunction with 
a free energy perturbation approach for the engineering of 
a more thermostable blue light photo receptor YtvA LOV 
domain from Bacillus subtilis. They identified nine stabiliz-
ing mutations and had a good correlation of r = 0.63 between 
experimentally determined and predicted ∆∆G values (Song 
et al. 2013). When one however considers the free energy 
surface as a function of protein sequence space, it is conceiv-
able that several local minima exist in addition to the global 
minimum. If the sequence of DuraPETase represents a point 
close to such a local minimum on the energy hypersurface, 
only small increases in thermostability can be achieved by 
single amino acid mutations. This is consistent with reports 
in the literature where larger enhancement in the thermosta-
bility of DuraPETase was only achieved with the introduc-
tion of a disulfide bond or a salt bridge (Brott et al. 2022; 
Lu et al. 2022). Both are mutations that could not have been 
identified with our screening approach.
The three mutations identified with the screening 
approach with a higher T m than original DuraPETase were 
 DuraPETaseS42M,  DuraPETaseS61M, and  DuraPETaseS223Y. 
None of these mutations are located near the active center. 
Interestingly, in the thermostable PETase variant Hot-
PETase, the serine in position 61 was also mutated, however 
in this case to a valine (Bell et al. 2022). Both mutations 
introduce more lipophilic amino acids. The serine is located 
near the surface of the enzyme in a relatively hydrophilic 
region. Introduction of a hydrophobic residue in this region 
likely leads to a more compact packing of the region to 
reduce the surface exposed hydrophobic area. This could 
pose a possible explanation for the increased thermostabil-
ity of the enzyme. The same explanation can be given for 
 DuraPETaseS61M and  DuraPETaseS223Y. Serine 61 and ser -
ine 223 are also located near the surface of the enzyme, 
and mutation to a methionine or tyrosine also drastically 
increases the lipophilicity at these positions. Analysis of 
PET hydrolysis by the DuraPETase variants showed that var-
iants with an improved thermostability also were more active 
than the original DuraPETase at an elevated reaction tem-
perature of 52 °C. The most stable variant  DuraPETaseS223Y 
showed the highest amount of PET degradation at 52 °C 
with a 10% increase compared to the original DuraPETase. 
If this can be attributed to an increased activity or a longer 
half-life of the enzyme at 52 °C remains unclear. Unfortu-
nately, this slight increase in both the T m and the improved 
degradation rate at 52 °C of the variant is likely not relevant 
for the potential industrial application of DuraPETase.
In conclusion, we demonstrated the applicability of NEQ 
alchemical free energy calculations for enzyme engineering 
projects. Challenges encountered with the extremely stable 
DuraPETase in this study, however, also highlight limita-
tions of the approach and provide directions for the further 
optimization and validation of free energy calculations. We 
also validated an efficient way to integrate NEQ alchemi-
cal free energy calculations with semi-empirical methods to 
reduce overall computational cost. Overall, this study shows 
that free energy calculations can be a valuable tool for the 
design of thermostable proteins that can be readily employed 
in these kinds of projects.
